They tackled some serious issues: drunk driving that results in the loss of a popular teenager and teen sex and pregnancies with just the right amount of education and tact. The only thing that bothered me was Treat Williams.  He is a good actor but not convincing as Dr. Brown, the famous neurosurgeon. A suit-wearing doctor from NYC doesn't suddenly wear jeans and carry a back pack. To be honest, with the unattractive beard, he wasn't convincing as a love interest either but beyond that Everwood is a quality show.",4,A show to watch.,1383523200,"11 4, 2013",2013,642,"['enjoyed', 'four', 'seasons', 'Everwood', 'A', 'young', 'Gregory', 'Smith', 'Rookie', 'Blues', 'Emily', 'Vancamp', 'Revenge', 'are', 'real', 'treat', 'tackled', 'serious', 'issues', 'drunk', 'driving', 'results', 'loss', 'popular', 'teenager', 'teen', 'sex', 'pregnancies', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'education', 'tact', 'only', 'thing', 'bothered', 'was', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'good', 'actor', 'not', 'convincing', 'Dr.', 'Brown', 'famous', 'neurosurgeon', 'suit-wearing', 'doctor', 'NYC', ""n't"", 'suddenly', 'wear', 'jeans', 'carry', 'back', 'pack', 'be', 'honest', 'unattractive', 'beard', 'was', ""n't"", 'convincing', 'love', 'interest', 'Everwood', 'quality', 'show']",Everwood: Season 1

831012,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0002DB0FO,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[13, 13]","Thank god for The WB. It has been a while since there has been a family drama that is so refrshingly honest, sincere, engaging, and brave. Since it's debut in September of 2002, this show has emerged as the crown jewel in the network's arsenal. Filled with fresh stories and new twists on old conventions, this show also boasts an incredible cast who bring to life realistic and engaging characters. This show continues to grow and expand on this brilliance in it's two subsequent seasons. Do not let the reviews who state otherwise fool you. It stays true to itself in later seasons and I can only assume these reviewers were unhappy with what happened and toss it off as ""bad"" or ""not as good"" simply because they didn't get it. Thank god the critics and real fans do. Treat Williams stars as famed New York surgeon, Dr. Andrew Brown. A workaholic with a wife and 2 kids. When tragedy strikes the family, he makes an about face in his life and moves his kids to the idyllic town of Everwood, Colorado. There he sets up shop with a practice in the town's old train station, which is right across the street from the town's only other physician, Dr. Harold Abbott(perfectly played by the fantastic Tom Amandes). Andy's son is 16 year old Ephram(The superb Gregory Smith), a loner type kid with a major chip on his shoulder concerning his father. And then there is 9 year old Delia(Vivian Cardone), a littly dynamo with a penchant for baseball caps. Others include Dr. Abbott's daughter Amy(The adorable Emily Van Camp), Abbott's son Bright(The funny Chris Pratt), Abbott's mother, and Andrew's nurse, Edna(The great Debra Mooney), her husband and town bus driver Irv(John Beasley), who is also the show's narrator, and Andy's lovely neighbor Nina(Stephanie Niznik). It had been such a long time since I had watched a stellar debut season. It was perfect. The show manages to be as realistic as possible and tries to go as far as it can with certain topics. Something I am sure the people who said the seasons afterward were no good only because they couldn't take the show's incredibly gutsy moves. One of the show's strengths is taking overused storylines and giving them a fresh and invigorated new shot at life. The ongoing arc this season between Ephram's love for Amy and her comatose boyfriend Colin Hart regaining his self and wanting to be Ephram's friend, is one cool example. The show is intelligently and creatively written, and is one of the most beautifully shot shows on television. Treat Williams has been given one heck of a career resurgence. He is so perfect for the show and this is really his moment. Where's his Emmy nod?. Tom Amandes as Dr. Abbott is right up there. He made his character a pompous fuss bucket and then turned him into a real human being who isn't all he seems. The banter and wars between him and Andy are priceless and are about as enjoyable as you can get. Episodes here range from the great to the fantastic. Some include the brilliant ""Episode 20"", a show about abortion. What happens is an impeccably written episode that shows both sides and different angles of the subject and it's choices. Well done. Other highlights include ""A Thanksgiving Tale"", ""Is There A Doctor In The House"", ""The Kissing Bridge"", ""Colin The Second"", and the fantastic finale, ""Home"". The kids here are all very well presented. Gregory Smith is a real find. A great repreentation of a young kid who isn't perfect and has issues. Emily Van Camp as Amy is his equal. Those big pretty doe eyes are nice too!. The WB should be proud. It has a show that is for everyone, and doesn't shy away from important topics. Nor does it cookie cutter it either. It's honest, tender, funny, realistic, life affirming, and brave. You will enjoy your trip to the rocky environs of Everwood. A place that you will want to visit again season after season.

I left the country to return to the U.S. just as season #3 finished airing there.  I was left with the cliffhanger episode of whether or not Colin survived the second surgery. After a decade of living in Europe and enjoying the small amount of commercials compared to the insanity of the U.S. TV networks, I decided not to have any TV upon my return -- my TV is only a monitor to play videos of my choosing.  One of my only regrets about this decision is that I have never been able to see Everwood again, one of the most memorable viewing experiences I had while I still watched any kind of network TV (albeit foreign network).  When I saw that Season I of Everwood was available, I snapped it up and had watched 3 episodes the first night, having to stop myself from watching more.  My boyfriend and I started watching episodes every night, revelling in not having to endure commercial breaks, and becoming immersed in the well-formed and well-acted characters and storylines.  Alas, we finished all the DVDs within a week!  You'll laugh, cry and be thoroughly entertained with the Everwood populace on this amazingly well-written and beautifully-produced series.  The DVD set has some wonderful extras as well.  I was only left wishing there had been more than 4 episodes with a commentary track.  The amazing irony about this gem of a TV series, as explained on one of the extra featurettes, is that it is deliberately a ""small"" series, which allows it to be as rich as it is in its storytelling.  If it were more popular, it would be forced to cater more to sponsors and network mandates, and thus lose its brilliance.  Says alot about mainstream American TV, doesn't it?I am currently signed up to be notified as soon as Series 2 is available on DVD because I've been waiting a LONG time to see if Colin survived that second surgery :-)  And while I'm at it, how about gearing up to make Series 3 available as well!",5,Everwood Has It All,1134000000,"12 8, 2005",2005,2010,"['lived', 'Netherlands', '2003', 'when', 'Dutch', 'TV', 'network', 'started', 'airing', 'series', 'left', 'country', 'return', 'U.S.', 'just', 'season', '3', 'finished', 'airing', 'there', 'was', 'left', 'cliffhanger', 'episode', 'not', 'Colin', 'survived', 'second', 'surgery', 'decade', 'living', 'Europe', 'enjoying', 'small', 'amount', 'commercials', 'compared', 'insanity', 'U.S.', 'TV', 'networks', 'decided', 'not', 'have', 'TV', 'return', 'TV', 'only', 'monitor', 'play', 'videos', 'choosing', 'One', 'only', 'regrets', 'decision', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'see', 'Everwood', 'again', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'viewing', 'experiences', 'had', 'still', 'watched', 'kind', 'network', 'TV', 'foreign', 'network', 'When', 'saw', 'Season', 'Everwood', 'was', 'available', 'snapped', 'up', 'had', 'watched', '3', 'first', 'night', 'having', 'stop', 'watching', 'more', 'boyfriend', 'started', 'watching', 'episodes', 'night', 'revelling', 'not', 'having', 'endure', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'becoming', 'immersed', 'well-formed', 'well-acted', 'characters', 'storylines', 'Alas', 'finished', 'DVDs', 'week', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'cry', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'Everwood', 'populace', 'amazingly', 'well-written', 'beautifully-produced', 'series', 'DVD', 'set', 'wonderful', 'extras', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'only', 'left', 'wishing', 'had', 'been', 'more', '4', 'episodes', 'commentary', 'track', 'amazing', 'irony', 'gem', 'TV', 'series', 'explained', 'one', 'extra', 'featurettes', 'deliberately', 'small', 'series', 'be', 'as', 'rich', 'storytelling', 'were', 'more', 'popular', 'would', 'be', 'forced', 'cater', 'more', 'sponsors', 'network', 'mandates', 'thus', 'lose', 'brilliance', 'alot', 'mainstream', 'American', 'TV', ""n't"", 'am', 'currently', 'signed', 'up', 'be', 'notified', 'as', 'soon', 'Series', '2', 'available', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'LONG', 'time', 'see', 'Colin', 'survived', 'second', 'surgery', ""'m"", 'how', 'about', 'gearing', 'up', 'make', 'Series', '3', 'available', 'as', 'well']",Everwood: Season 1

Everwood had conflict; but no matter how deep the conflict the characters maintained a relationship with each other.  There was always something deeper that bonded the characters.  Something that, in my opinion, is terribly missing in current times.  For me, the relationships between the characters in Everwood represented the best in human relationships.

The premise of the story is good.  I pretty easily was able to get into the plot and care about the characters, and can see why Everwood has its following.BUT, there is so much not to like.  For one--the narrating.  It's corny, it's trying to be philosophical, trying to make this show into something greater than it is.  It's a bore.  I hear that they ditched it in future seasons.Second--and my biggest criticism--it's clear that the writers had an agenda from the start.  Just in season one alone, they covered ""safe"" sex, surrogate motherhood, medical marijuana, [...], and abortion.  These things weren't touched on subtely.  They were thrown in your face, all with a far left slant, with the possible exception of abortion, where both doctors struggled with it.  But wouldn't you know, the more conservative of the two actually performs it.  Yet another statement made.Third, there is not enough humor, and what little there is, usually isn't that funny.The relationships are very soap-like--on one day, off the next.  It was exhausting trying to keep up, and became something of a frustration.  I ended up hoping Amy stayed with Colin, and Ephram with Laney, but finally in the end, I ceased to care anymore.  And this, just after the first season!  I know they dragged that saga out for the duration of the series.The acting is only average for TV, which isn't good.  Treat Williams was especially substandard.  I thought the best was the actor who played Bright.  There are some very likeable characters, which is pretty much what kept me watching.  But some characters were exaggerated to the point of being comical, while others were understated.  It was hard to get a feel for the tone of the series.It took me awhile to build up empathy for Ephram, who was incredibly rebellious and mouthy.  Call me old school, but I don't think, even in his situation, he had reason to yell and cuss like that at his dad.  That, along with the liberal slant to all social issues, made me wonder why on earth this is considered a family show.Season 1 ends with a heavy duty cliffhanger involving Colin, and no further seasons were sold on DVD.  I've been told that Season 1 was the best, so if that's the case, I don't see much reason to invest any more time in this series.",2,High hopes dashed!,1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,2369,"['had', 'high', 'hopes', 'series', ""'d"", 'read', 'heard', 'found', 'be', 'disappointing', 'premise', 'story', 'good', 'pretty', 'easily', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'plot', 'care', 'characters', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Everwood', 'following.BUT', 'so', 'much', 'not', 'like', 'one', 'narrating', 'corny', 'trying', 'be', 'philosophical', 'trying', 'make', 'show', 'something', 'greater', 'bore', 'hear', 'ditched', 'future', 'seasons.Second', 'biggest', 'criticism', 'clear', 'writers', 'had', 'agenda', 'start', 'Just', 'season', 'one', 'alone', 'covered', 'safe', 'sex', 'surrogate', 'motherhood', 'medical', 'marijuana', '[', ']', 'abortion', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'touched', 'subtely', 'were', 'thrown', 'face', 'far', 'left', 'slant', 'possible', 'exception', 'abortion', 'where', 'doctors', 'struggled', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'more', 'conservative', 'two', 'actually', 'statement', 'made.Third', 'not', 'enough', 'humor', 'what', 'little', 'usually', ""n't"", 'funny.The', 'relationships', 'are', 'very', 'soap-like', 'one', 'day', 'next', 'was', 'exhausting', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'became', 'something', 'frustration', 'ended', 'up', 'hoping', 'Amy', 'stayed', 'Colin', 'Ephram', 'Laney', 'finally', 'end', 'ceased', 'care', 'anymore', 'just', 'first', 'season', 'know', 'dragged', 'out', 'duration', 'series.The', 'acting', 'only', 'average', 'TV', ""n't"", 'good', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'was', 'especially', 'substandard', 'thought', 'best', 'was', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Bright', 'are', 'very', 'likeable', 'characters', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'kept', 'watching', 'characters', 'were', 'exaggerated', 'point', 'being', 'comical', 'others', 'were', 'understated', 'was', 'hard', 'get', 'feel', 'tone', 'series.It', 'took', 'awhile', 'build', 'up', 'empathy', 'Ephram', 'who', 'was', 'incredibly', 'rebellious', 'mouthy', 'Call', 'old', 'school', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'even', 'situation', 'had', 'reason', 'yell', 'cuss', 'dad', 'liberal', 'slant', 'social', 'issues', 'made', 'wonder', 'why', 'earth', 'considered', 'family', 'show.Season', '1', 'heavy', 'duty', 'cliffhanger', 'involving', 'Colin', 'further', 'seasons', 'were', 'sold', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'best', 'so', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'reason', 'invest', 'more', 'time', 'series']",Everwood: Season 1

A world-class surgeon featured in magazines and newspapers around the world, the good doctor lands in Everwood following a tragic turn of events in his life in New York, and from that point on, the small mountain town was never the same.In this show, now in the third season on The WB, Treat Williams stars as Dr. Andy Brown. After his wife dies in a car accident, Andy moves his children, teenager Ephram and younger Delia, to the tiny mountain town of Everwood, Colorado, mainly because he remembers his now-deceased wife mentioning the village once. As a doctor, Andy was amazing, but his parental skills were severly lacking. He had worked most of his life at his job, and the family almost came second. Now he realized it had to come first and it was a tough adjustment for both himself and his kids.Treat Williams is fantastic in the role of Dr. Brown. You almost believe that he is a world-class surgeon, who now practices free family medicine. But the best we see him at is in his relationship with his son, which features the backbone for the show, particularly in the first season.Ephram is played by the very talented Gregory Smith. He has the whole brooding teenager bit down perfectly. His anger toward his father is well documented throughout the season, but you also see that despite it all, he still cares about him. A talented piano player, the youngster tries to strike a balance in life with music, his father and school all major players in the balance.Emily VanKamp stars as Amy Abbott, the beautiful daughter of the town's 'other' doctor, Harold Abbott. She quickly becomes interested in Ephram, but for reasons that really have nothing to do with him, but more to do with his father. This first season served as a spring board for the Amy-Ephram arc that continues to this day.Debra Mooney is also great as Edna Harper, mother to Dr. Abbott and nurse to Dr. Brown. She comes across as exactly the type of person you might meet in a small mountain town. Her husband Irv, played by John Beasley, doesn't get as much screen time as he deserves, but he does serve as the narrator on the show. The narration on the final episode is probably one of the best on any television show in a long time.Vivien Cardone plays young Delia with the perfect amount of innocence needed for the part. She is more foregiving than her older brother, but also manages to find trouble of her own in many different ways.Chris Pratt had a smaller role in the first season than in season two. As Bright Abbott, Amy's brother, he served mainly as a protagonist to Ephram at the start, but his character made some great strides over the season and was a key part of season two.Tom Amandes plays Harold Abbott, certainly providing much of the comic relief of the show. He is a true family man, but very set in his ways, which leads to many interesting situations.

It is highly unlikely you haven't heard about this show, but just in case that happened I'll tell you some things about the plot, so you can decide whether this is the kind of show you might like.Dr. Andrew Brown (Treat Williams) is a highly successful neurosurgeon that has neglected his family in order to take care of his patients. But reality crashes down on him when his wife (Brenda Strong) dies in an accident. He doesn't know what to do, and, in the spur of the moment, decides to move with his two children to Everwood, a little town in Colorado that his wife had loved when they saw it for the first time, a long time before her death.Leaving the big city and becoming a small town doctor will mean many changes Andrew, but even more for his teenager son Ephram (Gregory Smith), and his young daughter, Delia (Vivien Cardone), that have to leave their friends and everything they know in order to move to a strange city. What it is worse, they are not accustomed to actually spending time with their father, and miss their mother a lot...Will the Brown's become a real family? And will they find their place in the world in Everwood? These are some of the questions that this first season begins to answer, and the reason why you should watch this dvd.

I'm not afraid to admit that I did watch this show for a while and did like it only because of its ""hook-liner"" premise: A family oriented television show concerning a man, Dr. Andrew Brown (Treat Williams undoubtedly is easier to look at when he's got hair on his face), who has lost his wife and deals with the difficulties he goes though trying to reconnect with his Son, Ephram, an overly emotional teenage boy who seeks his old home in New York after moving to Everwood and blames his father for his mother's death, and his daughter Delia who doesn't appear to have any qualms about moving except when concerning her new school. But as the show progressed it began to turn to be just like all the other teendramas on WB54; The brooding teenage boy meets the 'The girl every-guy wants, with a dark past' young blonde girl (daughter of a Doctor who becomes rivals with Ephram's father, who reminds me of ""Squidward"" of Sponge-bob square-pants) and eventually develops feelings for her later on in the show, everyone in high-school has to be ""together/couple"" when in reality its not like that all, the dramas concerning the young girl Delia is mediocore but its believable, and the teenagers, (who are, naturally about as wise as a undeveloped tomato) always ends up correcting the Parents on everything instead of the other way around.The only real change is the more focus on the adults and their troubles.

831056,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0002DB0FO,Robert Moore,"[0, 0]","First, I have to take issue with the office review, which compares EVERWOOD to NORTHERN EXPOSURE and PICKET FENCES. Both of those shows had a touch of surreality that plays no role on EVERWOOD. I suspect that the reviewer was thinking more in terms of the small town setting, but I would compare the show more to family dramas like ONCE AND AGAIN. Nonetheless, it is an excellent series. It could easily not be. The story of a newly widowed big city brain surgeon relocating to a small Colorado town to start over with his young daughter and teen-aged son could easily descend into something trite and melodramatic, but EVERWOOD manages to avoid clich&eacute; and present a group of believable and likable characters. Moreover, Everwood itself takes on the feel of a place that you come to know and like. While I would still prefer to visit Cicely, Alaska more than Everwood, but it runs a close second.Watching the show made me appreciate more Greg Berlanti and his skills as a producer. I've enjoyed his work on BROTHERS AND SISTERS and absolutely loved ELI STONE (easily my favorite of the shows he has worked on). He has a real knack for creating characters and situations that are involving and that make you care about what will happen next. And I like that for the most part he avoids ""a very special episode of EVERWOOD."" Even in the episode that deals with an eighteen-year-old girl getting an abortion, he does not sensationalize it. He doesn't make anything about that episode glib or easy, and even has a couple of surprising twists. But neither does he play it up for any cheap thrills. Furthermore, just the nerve to show an abortion on a TV show is pretty amazing in these hyper-politicized days. About 99% of the time on television a pregnant teen ends up having a miscarriage. Similarly, in an episode where a woman thinks her husband has had an affair with another woman, she learns that it was, instead, a man.The cast is solid enough. Everyone is at least competent, while a few are extremely appealing. Treat Williams is great in the lead as brain surgeon turned small town doctor. I also really enjoy Emily Vancamp in the show. I didn't know that she was in the show, but I enjoyed her a lot on BROTHERS AND SISTERS, where she plays the least mess up person in the larger Walker family. Even in this show, as a teen of around 16 or 17, she already showed a great deal of appeal.

Without falling into a slump, Everwood remained fresh and new. It was always interesting and always relevent. I appreciated the range of actors, even having Irv and Edna, two characters in the senior citizen age group, playing key and pivital roles. This show was a true gem, a diamond in the rough, if you will. I signed petitions and even e-mailed the new CW president, Dawn Ostroff, but it was to no avail. I really hope the station knows what it missed out on. I've seen letter after letter in the newspapers and other publications asking why this show was cancelled. I don't understand, it seems as if the show had supporters, so why flush this gem for the resurrection of the horrid, past it's experation date, 7th Heaven? I guess I'll never understand how good television gets left in the dust while smut, trash, and sheer idiocy continues to reign.Anyway my point is simply this, Everwood was awesome. If anybody is paying attention, please give its fans some belated satisfaction by supplying the 2nd-4th seasons on DVD. I think that we at least are owed that.

831061,AZBMTXXNPS6YD,B0002DB0FO,"Subauthor ""jeffgonsalves dot com""","[92, 95]","I had never seen an episode of ""Everwood"" before, but the premise intrigued me. A renowned brain surgeon moving to the middle of nowhere after his wife dies to establish new ties, build a new family, and perhaps forget past failures. Treat Williams is excellent as Dr. Andy Brown, a talented surgeon who treats his patients better than his own children. Andy is neglectful, but not intentionally. His absence from his children's lives is maybe an admission that he has not clue how to relate to them. Watching him bond reluctantly with his hostile son is one of the many pleasures of this delicate, intelligently-written show.Dr. Brown is an affable man, yet flawed, which makes him instantly recognizable. His struggles to properly raise his son and daughter form the core of ""Everwood"". Williams anchors the show with his vivid, tortured protrayal of a man with internal demons hidden by a calm facade. He's the type of man one would enjoy inviting to a poker game, a basketball tournament, or a beer in the local bar. His son Ephram, played by the amazing Gregory Smith, is a gifted pianist who clashes with his father over issues of desertion and emotional detachment. Watching them spar and yell and eventually come to a greater understanding of each other is an almost religious experience. Ephram challenges his father to see if he really cares. and his testing brings the family close to the verge of an emotional meltdown. He's the type of adolescent who is fiercely loyal to his friends, sees through the transparency of phony peers, and is uncompromising in his demands for basic decency. The daughter, Delia, is a sweet kid who just wants to fit in at school, but has a tough time adjusting to the almost alien climate of Everwood.The subplots are compelling, the supporting cast uniformly superb, and the character interactions credible. The season finale builds suspense so brilliantly it's almost painful to watch. After viewing the final episode, I regretted that I would have to part company with these special people, at least for a short time (which means that either the writers did a stellar job or I need to get out and socialize more!).

831064,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B0002DB0FO,Todd Smith,"[1, 2]","A few years ago, I was watching a very forgettable movie on cable, so forgettable in fact, that I can't even remember the name of it. This film did however have a tremendous teen actor, who I took note of, because of the charisma and intensity that he brought to his role. I thought this kid could one day be a big star and took note of his name, Gregory Smith. Since then I have become a huge Gregory Smith fan, seeing most of his films and now his TV show, Everwood. The story of Everwood begins when world famous neurosurgeon, Dr. Andrew Brown (Treat Williams), loses his wife in a car accident. Distraught, Brown decides to leave his prestigious job and move his family from New York City to the small town of Everwood, Colorado, where he opens up a free medical clinic. Brown was a brilliant surgeon, but really doesn't have a clue about how to be a father. His children, in particular his son Ephram (Gregory Smith), does not make the transition easy on him. To be honest, this isn't the kind of show that I usually go for and I was only planning on watching a couple of episodes. A couple of episodes quickly turned into much more as this infectious group of people really drew me into their lives and touched me in a way that a TV show never has. Part of me could really relate to their personal struggles and attempts at overcoming the adversity they faced, if nothing else, It was empowering and inspirational. Veteran actor, Treat Williams, leads a truly terrific cast, playing the man whose turned his life upside down in order to get closer to his children. Dr. Brown is supposed to be the one who has all the answers, at the hospital, that may be true, but at home, it's a big learning curve for him. The dynamic between this quirky celebrity doctor and his introverted, yet artistic outcast son, is really the heart of this show. Gregory Smith is off the charts good as young Ephram Brown, who possesses many of the same qualities as his father. Those qualities are usually at odds with the qualities of his mother, causing him to be a bit impulsive and quick to speak his mind. Ephram quickly falls for the most popular girl in school, Amy Abbott (Emily Van Camp), who is the daughter of Everwood's first family. Amy clearly has feeling for Ephram, but a shocking secret that keeps her from getting close to him. Van Camp, now the star of ABC's Revenge, is asked to wear many hats, sometimes she's sweet and innocent, while at other times she's immature and irritating. but no matter the mood, she's always at the top of her game, really letting you feel, what Amy is feeling. Amy's father is Dr. Harold Abbott (Tom Amandes) who was the only doctor in Everwood, until Dr. Brown showed up. Abbott is arrogant, egocentric, and absolutely hysterical. Amandes brings some much needed comic relief to the show and his interactions with the other members of the cast are priceless. If it wasn't for Everwood being a WB show, Tom Amandes would have several Emmy Awards by now, because he really is that good. Everwood is a family drama that is at times hard to watch, because you will be deeply affected by these characters and at some point will be able to personally relate to what their going through. It pulls at the heart strings, that's for sure, but seeing that adversities faced by these characters and how they were able to over come them is really an inspiration. I said earlier that this is the kind of show that I don't usually watch, but it should be for the way it made me think and the way it made me feel.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...] - @tss5078,1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,3530,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'watching', 'very', 'forgettable', 'movie', 'cable', 'so', 'forgettable', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'name', 'film', 'did', 'however', 'have', 'tremendous', 'teen', 'actor', 'who', 'took', 'note', 'charisma', 'intensity', 'brought', 'role', 'thought', 'kid', 'could', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'big', 'star', 'took', 'note', 'name', 'Gregory', 'Smith', 'then', 'have', 'become', 'huge', 'Gregory', 'Smith', 'fan', 'seeing', 'most', 'films', 'now', 'TV', 'show', 'Everwood', 'story', 'Everwood', 'begins', 'when', 'world', 'famous', 'neurosurgeon', 'Dr.', 'Andrew', 'Brown', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'wife', 'car', 'accident', 'Distraught', 'Brown', 'leave', 'prestigious', 'job', 'move', 'family', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'small', 'town', 'Everwood', 'Colorado', 'where', 'up', 'free', 'medical', 'clinic', 'Brown', 'was', 'brilliant', 'surgeon', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'how', 'be', 'father', 'children', 'particular', 'son', 'Ephram', 'Gregory', 'Smith', 'not', 'make', 'transition', 'easy', 'be', 'honest', ""n't"", 'kind', 'show', 'usually', 'go', 'was', 'only', 'planning', 'watching', 'couple', 'episodes', 'couple', 'episodes', 'quickly', 'turned', 'much', 'more', 'infectious', 'group', 'people', 'really', 'drew', 'lives', 'touched', 'way', 'TV', 'show', 'never', 'Part', 'could', 'really', 'relate', 'personal', 'struggles', 'attempts', 'overcoming', 'adversity', 'faced', 'nothing', 'else', 'was', 'empowering', 'inspirational', 'Veteran', 'actor', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'truly', 'terrific', 'cast', 'playing', 'man', 'turned', 'life', 'upside', 'down', 'order', 'get', 'closer', 'children', 'Dr.', 'Brown', 'supposed', 'be', 'one', 'who', 'answers', 'hospital', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'home', 'big', 'learning', 'curve', 'dynamic', 'quirky', 'celebrity', 'doctor', 'introverted', 'yet', 'artistic', 'outcast', 'son', 'really', 'heart', 'show', 'Gregory', 'Smith', 'charts', 'good', 'young', 'Ephram', 'Brown', 'who', 'many', 'same', 'qualities', 'father', 'qualities', 'are', 'usually', 'odds', 'qualities', 'mother', 'causing', 'be', 'bit', 'impulsive', 'quick', 'speak', 'mind', 'Ephram', 'quickly', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'Amy', 'Abbott', 'Emily', 'Van', 'Camp', 'who', 'daughter', 'Everwood', 'first', 'family', 'Amy', 'clearly', 'feeling', 'Ephram', 'shocking', 'secret', 'getting', 'close', 'Van', 'Camp', 'now', 'star', 'ABC', 'Revenge', 'asked', 'wear', 'many', 'hats', 'sometimes', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'other', 'times', 'immature', 'irritating', 'matter', 'mood', 'always', 'top', 'game', 'really', 'letting', 'feel', 'what', 'Amy', 'feeling', 'Amy', 'father', 'Dr.', 'Harold', 'Abbott', 'Tom', 'Amandes', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'doctor', 'Everwood', 'Dr.', 'Brown', 'showed', 'up', 'Abbott', 'arrogant', 'egocentric', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'Amandes', 'much', 'needed', 'comic', 'relief', 'show', 'interactions', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'are', 'priceless', 'was', ""n't"", 'Everwood', 'being', 'WB', 'show', 'Tom', 'Amandes', 'would', 'have', 'several', 'Emmy', 'Awards', 'now', 'really', 'good', 'Everwood', 'family', 'drama', 'times', 'hard', 'watch', 'will', 'be', 'deeply', 'affected', 'characters', 'point', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'personally', 'relate', 'what', 'going', 'heart', 'strings', 'sure', 'seeing', 'adversities', 'faced', 'characters', 'how', 'were', 'able', 'come', 'really', 'inspiration', 'said', 'earlier', 'kind', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'watch', 'should', 'be', 'way', 'made', 'think', 'way', 'made', 'feel']",Everwood: Season 1

Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[67, 79]","This series, which just finished it's second season on the WB network, is the perfect mix of comedy, drama, characters, and storylines.  The show its self is about a family (the Browns) that move from New York City to the small town of Everwood after the passing of their mother.From creator Greg Berlantini, comes a powerful series, that at first explores how a family must come to gripes with the death of a love one, but eventually evolves into a dramedy about getting on with one's life, with the beautiful Colorado Back Drop.One of the best things Everwood has going for it is it's very talented cast.  Treat Williams plays Dr. Andy Brown, Gregory Smith plays Ethram, Emily VanCamp plays Amy Abbott, while John Beasley, Tom Amandes, and Chris Pratt fill in the supporting cast.  Not to mention the amazing Debra Mooney, who plays the tuff-as-nails Grandmother to the Abbott Clan.Over the course of the 23-episode first season, the show manly surrounds the ongoing story of Collin Heart, a boy who was put into a comma after a car accident.  But the overall arc of the season is not what makes this show so specail, its the stand-alone episodes which provide positive information on many subjects families should talk about but don't: Teen Drinking, Pregnancy, Abortion, Dieing Family Members, and so on.Once again Warner Brothers had put together an amazing set of episodes from an ubelievably wonderful show, complamented by special features (4 commentaries, deleted scenes, and behind-the-scenes featurrettes).

831066,A18758S1PUYIDT,B0002DB0FO,Viva,"[0, 0]","Okay, Everwood characters such as Dr. Brown may on rare occasions get a tad preachy.  But only rarely.  Otherwise, this a fine ensemble cast, with a reasonable amount of angst, great wilderness and small town locations, plenty of family and school drama, and content that is perfectly okay for older kids, say middle school aged, to view with or without their parents in the room.Treat Williams is appealing as the aforementioned NY doctor who moves to a tiny town after his wife's death.  The biggest challenge for him is raising his young daughter and teenage son, the latter one filled with bitterness about being forced to move and rightfully angry with his dad for hardly having been home in the earlier years.  This of course leads to much confrontation, arguing, blame, and guilt, which makes for great scenes of conflict.  The easier kid, Delia, is a delight to watch.  The rival doctor is a real stealer of scenes, while the woman playing his toughp-as-nails mother is usually fun as well.  There's also a neighbor who has to raise her son alone and can connect with Dr. B. on that level, while Ephram must deal with his feelings for the gentle Amy, who is torn between him and her comatose lover, Colin.  Her brother, Bright, isn't very...bright. But he's okay in his way.Beautiful locations and some good songs too.",5,A great jewel of a series,1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,1326,"['Okay', 'Everwood', 'characters', 'such', 'Dr.', 'Brown', 'may', 'rare', 'occasions', 'get', 'tad', 'preachy', 'only', 'rarely', 'Otherwise', 'fine', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'reasonable', 'amount', 'angst', 'great', 'wilderness', 'small', 'town', 'locations', 'plenty', 'family', 'school', 'drama', 'content', 'perfectly', 'okay', 'older', 'kids', 'say', 'middle', 'school', 'aged', 'view', 'parents', 'room.Treat', 'Williams', 'appealing', 'aforementioned', 'NY', 'doctor', 'who', 'tiny', 'town', 'wife', 'death', 'biggest', 'challenge', 'raising', 'young', 'daughter', 'teenage', 'son', 'latter', 'one', 'filled', 'bitterness', 'being', 'forced', 'move', 'rightfully', 'angry', 'dad', 'hardly', 'having', 'been', 'home', 'earlier', 'years', 'course', 'much', 'confrontation', 'arguing', 'blame', 'guilt', 'great', 'scenes', 'conflict', 'easier', 'kid', 'Delia', 'delight', 'watch', 'rival', 'doctor', 'real', 'stealer', 'scenes', 'woman', 'playing', 'toughp-as-nails', 'mother', 'usually', 'fun', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'neighbor', 'who', 'raise', 'son', 'alone', 'can', 'connect', 'Dr.', 'B.', 'level', 'Ephram', 'must', 'deal', 'feelings', 'gentle', 'Amy', 'who', 'torn', 'comatose', 'lover', 'Colin', 'brother', 'Bright', ""n't"", 'very', 'bright', 'okay', 'way.Beautiful', 'locations', 'good', 'songs', 'too']",Everwood: Season 1

I do have a few minor quibbles about repetitive plot elements.  All the characters seem to be hypersensitive.  There are lots of hurt feelings and pouting.  None of the characters can keep a secret.  If one characters tells another a secret in deepest confidence, you can expect that in the next episode the recipient of the confidential communication will blab inappropriately to someone else, and that will set off another round of hurt feelings and pouting.  There are endless rounds of love triangles, romantic breakups and reconciliations.  There is a lot of death and mourning.  Lastly, the set decoration is excessive.  The homes of the principal characters all look like the painters and decorators just left and they are waiting for the photographers from House Beautiful.  But the series is still wonderful.",5,Hooked - with minor quibbles,1325030400,"12 28, 2011",2011,921,"['did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'like', 'series', 'friend', 'talked', 'giving', 'try', 'got', 'hooked', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'repetitive', 'plot', 'elements', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'hypersensitive', 'are', 'lots', 'hurt', 'feelings', 'pouting', 'None', 'characters', 'can', 'keep', 'secret', 'one', 'characters', 'secret', 'deepest', 'confidence', 'can', 'expect', 'next', 'episode', 'recipient', 'confidential', 'communication', 'will', 'blab', 'inappropriately', 'someone', 'else', 'will', 'set', 'off', 'round', 'hurt', 'feelings', 'pouting', 'are', 'endless', 'rounds', 'love', 'triangles', 'romantic', 'breakups', 'reconciliations', 'lot', 'death', 'mourning', 'Lastly', 'set', 'decoration', 'excessive', 'homes', 'principal', 'characters', 'look', 'painters', 'decorators', 'just', 'left', 'are', 'waiting', 'photographers', 'House', 'Beautiful', 'series', 'still', 'wonderful']",Everwood: Season 1
