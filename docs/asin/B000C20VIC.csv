954384,A20EEWWSFMZ1PN,B000C20VIC,"bernie ""xyzzy""","[19, 26]","Many programs of the era had their own introductory music and this program was no exception; the music was by Leonard Rosseman.They always start out with ""staring Rick Jason and Vic Morrow."" Instead of great sweeping epics this program focuses on a single squad with their trials and tribulation with confronting the Germans in WWII. Each episode is one hour and has to oppose a problem and a solution in that time. This was back in the time of professional privates.In 1967-1968 Vietnam if you were lucky certain areas actually had TV broadcasting at 1600 hrs. You guessed it; this was one of the programs. I wonderer what the locals thought of the episode?This would be a good series to own. Not just for the nostalgia, but the personal conflicts portrait in the program are still with us today.",5,This program has unique introductory music,1152921600,"07 15, 2006",2006,797,"['Many', 'programs', 'era', 'had', 'own', 'introductory', 'music', 'program', 'was', 'exception', 'music', 'was', 'Leonard', 'Rosseman.They', 'always', 'start', 'out', 'staring', 'Rick', 'Jason', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'Instead', 'great', 'sweeping', 'epics', 'program', 'single', 'squad', 'trials', 'tribulation', 'confronting', 'Germans', 'WWII', 'episode', 'one', 'hour', 'oppose', 'problem', 'solution', 'time', 'was', 'back', 'time', 'professional', 'privates.In', '1967-1968', 'Vietnam', 'were', 'lucky', 'certain', 'areas', 'actually', 'had', 'TV', 'broadcasting', '1600', 'hrs', 'guessed', 'was', 'one', 'programs', 'wonderer', 'what', 'locals', 'thought', 'episode', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'series', 'own', 'Not', 'just', 'nostalgia', 'personal', 'conflicts', 'portrait', 'program', 'are', 'still', 'today']",Combat!: The Best of Saunders

The only downside of this set, is that there is only 4 shows on it. There were so manygreat Combat shows that featured Vic Morrow, it would have been tough to choose the best! This was a teaserof Combat and makes you want the complete series. Well, I had to purchase the complete series after viewingthis DVD. If you liked the show and Vic Morrow as much as I do, I recommend that you purchase the completeseries now instead of this set. If you are just curious about the show, by all means, I recommemd this set!!",5,Combat!

Combat! has great storylines that follow American G.I.'s from Normandy and beyond.  Combat! provides excellent acting and great ""edge of your seat"" storylines.  Combat! was the very best TV Action/Drama on TV during the 60's. I highly reccomend Combat! to anyone that likes W. W. II.
