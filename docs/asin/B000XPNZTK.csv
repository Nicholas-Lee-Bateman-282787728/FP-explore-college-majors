I always liked Tom and band.. the thing is he is so deceptively a talented songwriter that it was easy to take him for granted. Forgive me Tom for doing that! After learning so much about him as a man, and a kind, sweet man at that, for some reason that helped me appreciate his poetry and musical skills all the more.  The movie shows his seedling talent and how he persisted and learned and grew, and also kept a strong core of optimism and delight at how things in his life unfolded. Beautifully done camera and wonderful clips of young Tom and band. Absolutely worth every penny, and even if you think you are not a big TP fan, get it anyway if you like any rock music at all, you will be converted, as I was. I am now in the process of buying every thing this brilliant man has ever done.And now we will be treated to TP and HB halftime at the Superbowl.

1114597,AI6F4WN2KYLSX,B000XPNZTK,Bloodbath_and_Beyond,"[0, 0]","Even if you're not a huge fan of Tom Petty, this is an incredible documentary. For one main reason, it actually tells the story of a songwriter and band in such a thorough way, from his humble roots in Gainsville Florida, to his first time hearing early rock records (Elvis, Beatles, Stones, Byrds), his first band Mudcrutch, their trials and tribulations to breaking out of the local scene securing a record deal to the eventual formation of the Heartbreakers. It takes you all through his breakout success with his classic 1979 record Damn The Torpedos and his very successful run through the 80's and early 90's, all the way up to 2006. What makes it so good is through the use of tons of home video footage, pictures, some live footage snippets from TV shows etc, as well as very detailed narrative from Tom himself, as well as the Heartbreakers (Mike Campbell, Ron Blair, Benmont Tench, Stan Lynch) as well as later members of the group, early bandmembers of Mudcrutch, associates and friends like Stevie Nicks, Jeff Lynn, Dave Stewart, Eddie Veder, Dave Grohl, Jimmy Iovinne, Johnny Depp on the entire history of his career. It's the kinda thing you wish there was way more of for many other bands, this is really what a documentary of a bands history is supposed to be like. Swamped in an era of VH1 Behind The Music type shows where you get vague details spread throughout a 45 minute show with 15 min of commercials it always leaves the hardcore music fan wanting more. Not with this though.Even though it's about 4 hours, it never feels boring. Tom Petty's story is actually almost magical in how perfect it all came together for him, from his early garage rock days, meeting musicians that would fit into his vision, working his way up through the industry, it really is a truly inspiring story. It also touches on Petty's craft of songwriting and his love for the studio and recording albums and the production of it. There's always another interesting or funny story around the corner, especially the early years of the band in the mid 70's detailing some of the tales of the bands more wilder youthful days.  So if you're a rock fan at all, you'll want to check this out, there should be more of this kind of thing out there",5,A real rock doc,1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,2238,"['Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'incredible', 'documentary', 'one', 'main', 'reason', 'actually', 'story', 'songwriter', 'band', 'such', 'thorough', 'way', 'humble', 'roots', 'Gainsville', 'Florida', 'first', 'time', 'hearing', 'early', 'rock', 'records', 'Elvis', 'Beatles', 'Stones', 'Byrds', 'first', 'band', 'Mudcrutch', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'breaking', 'local', 'scene', 'securing', 'record', 'deal', 'eventual', 'formation', 'Heartbreakers', 'breakout', 'success', 'classic', '1979', 'record', 'Damn', 'Torpedos', 'very', 'successful', 'run', '80', 'early', '90', 'way', '2006', 'What', 'so', 'good', 'use', 'tons', 'home', 'video', 'footage', 'pictures', 'live', 'footage', 'snippets', 'TV', 'shows', 'etc', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'detailed', 'narrative', 'Tom', 'as', 'well', 'Heartbreakers', 'Mike', 'Campbell', 'Ron', 'Blair', 'Benmont', 'Tench', 'Stan', 'Lynch', 'as', 'well', 'later', 'members', 'group', 'early', 'bandmembers', 'Mudcrutch', 'associates', 'friends', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'Jeff', 'Lynn', 'Dave', 'Stewart', 'Eddie', 'Veder', 'Dave', 'Grohl', 'Jimmy', 'Iovinne', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'entire', 'history', 'career', 'kinda', 'thing', 'wish', 'was', 'way', 'more', 'many', 'other', 'bands', 'really', 'what', 'documentary', 'bands', 'history', 'supposed', 'be', 'Swamped', 'era', 'VH1', 'Music', 'type', 'where', 'get', 'vague', 'details', 'spread', '45', 'minute', 'show', '15', 'min', 'commercials', 'always', 'hardcore', 'music', 'fan', 'wanting', 'more', 'Not', 'though.Even', '4', 'hours', 'never', 'boring', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'story', 'actually', 'almost', 'magical', 'how', 'perfect', 'came', 'together', 'early', 'garage', 'rock', 'days', 'meeting', 'musicians', 'would', 'fit', 'vision', 'working', 'way', 'up', 'industry', 'really', 'truly', 'inspiring', 'story', 'also', 'Petty', 'craft', 'songwriting', 'love', 'studio', 'recording', 'albums', 'production', 'always', 'interesting', 'funny', 'story', 'corner', 'especially', 'early', 'years', 'band', 'mid', '70', 'detailing', 'tales', 'bands', 'more', 'wilder', 'youthful', 'days', 'So', ""'re"", 'rock', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'want', 'check', 'out', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'kind', 'thing', 'there']",Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers - Runnin' Down A Dream (4-Disc Set)

1114613,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000XPNZTK,Kevin Killian,"[4, 4]","Peter Bogdanovich has made a  documentary that totally holds your interest even over a staggering four hour running time.I didn't know much about Tom Petty growing up, but I've had a bellyful now.  And yes, all the hits sounds strangely familiar, from American Girl to Free Falling, just like we saw on the halftime show at the Super Bowl a year ago.  More recent material hasn't really saturated the airwaves, and some of it like The Last DJ, is almost incredibly insipid.We get to know and like Tom Petty, though he has a streak of, I don't know what, egotism, that's totally understandable.  After all, he is the most successful rocker ever, or so the movie argues, with sales in the millions and three ""game-changing"" releases.  Still, he doesn't seem like he'd be an easy person to work for and all the Heartbreakers express shock and disappointment over having been treated shabbily, or ignored, at various times.  But I applaud him for showing his faults, he could have authorized a kiss-kiss type lovefest.One wonders what happened in that divorce that prevented the filmmakers from even mentioning the name of his first wife.  Must have been nasty!

1114615,A17BUUBOU0598B,B000XPNZTK,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[4, 4]","Runnin' Down a Dreamdocuments the history of Tom Petty, including his band Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers, Mudcrutch, The Travelling Wilburys, and his extensive solo career and collaborations with other artists.  There is so much to cover, in fact, that this documentary stretches for 4 hours, and that's before you've even touched special features.  The format is somewhat of a common one for musical documentaries.  There is a montage of interview footage that is sliced and diced to tell the story somewhat chronologically from a variety of perspectives.  Even after 4 hours of interview footage, music video clips, concert footage and photo stills, this documentary is a pleasure from start to finish.  That is probably the best testament to how well made and fun to watch this really is.The format of this documentary should please die-hard fans and casual listeners alike.  I would consider myself a pretty big Tom Petty fan, but I watched this with somebody who was not.  Well after seeing the documentary, they are a fan now.  The last half, in particular, is so chock full of amazing music that most people *know* but not everybody realizes is Tom Petty.  So this is a good movie to watch with somebody you want to convert over to being a Tom Petty fan.The blend of formats is really good as a *bio-pick* but it's also nice for music history junkies.  Sprinkled into all the interviews are tons of factoids and tidbits about how certain songs came to be, who wrote them, who worked on them, and on and on.  Serious fans will really enjoy all those details.But everybody can relate to some of the stories of hardship and challenges that are also sprinkled throughout.  We get to hear about Tom's first battle to get out of his record contract when Shelter Records was bought by MCA Universal.  And we get to see the various versions of Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers take shape for various reasons, from Stan slowly falling on his sword to Howie's drug problems.  In fact, it's very surprising just how multi-faceted the telling of these stories is.  Rather than give us the sanitized corporate version of how so-and-so was kicked out of the group, this documentary allows clips of all parties to be included so that you can hear it from the horse's mouth and make up your own mind.  I really appreciate that fact since I love to know as much of the story as possible and I am instinctively distrustful of one-sided portrayals.As with any music documentary, the music is a large part of this film.  And the depth and bredth of Tom's career is shown, not just in his songs, but in his collaborations with Stevie Nicks, Roger Maguin, George Harrison, Jeff Lynn, and many others.  And of course if you include the supergroup The Travelling Wilburys, you have to add to George Harrison and Jeff Lynn the venerable names of Roy Orbison and Bob Dylan.  This is really an amazing bit of music with some of the best popular artists of the last 50 years represented here.I highly recommend this documentary.  There is also a4-Disc Setwhich includes some rare audio tracks and more special features.  So die-hard fans will probably enjoy that set.  I was able to pick it up on sale, but either way this is a great film and you should seek it out.Highly recommended.Enjoy!",5,Tom Petty's Musical Life On Film - The Runnin' Down a Dream Documentary,1230249600,"12 26, 2008",2008,3271,"['Runnin', 'Down', 'Dreamdocuments', 'history', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'including', 'band', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Heartbreakers', 'Mudcrutch', 'Travelling', 'Wilburys', 'extensive', 'solo', 'career', 'collaborations', 'other', 'artists', 'so', 'much', 'cover', 'fact', 'documentary', 'stretches', '4', 'hours', ""'ve"", 'even', 'touched', 'special', 'features', 'format', 'somewhat', 'common', 'one', 'musical', 'documentaries', 'montage', 'interview', 'footage', 'sliced', 'diced', 'tell', 'story', 'somewhat', 'chronologically', 'variety', 'perspectives', 'Even', '4', 'hours', 'interview', 'footage', 'music', 'video', 'clips', 'concert', 'footage', 'photo', 'stills', 'documentary', 'pleasure', 'start', 'finish', 'probably', 'best', 'testament', 'how', 'well', 'made', 'fun', 'watch', 'really', 'is.The', 'format', 'documentary', 'should', 'please', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'casual', 'listeners', 'alike', 'would', 'consider', 'pretty', 'big', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'fan', 'watched', 'somebody', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'Well', 'seeing', 'documentary', 'are', 'fan', 'now', 'last', 'half', 'particular', 'so', 'chock', 'full', 'amazing', 'music', 'most', 'people', '*know*', 'not', 'everybody', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', 'somebody', 'want', 'convert', 'being', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'fan.The', 'blend', 'formats', 'really', 'good', '*bio-pick*', 'also', 'nice', 'music', 'history', 'junkies', 'Sprinkled', 'interviews', 'are', 'tons', 'factoids', 'tidbits', 'how', 'certain', 'songs', 'came', 'be', 'who', 'wrote', 'who', 'worked', 'Serious', 'fans', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy', 'details.But', 'everybody', 'can', 'relate', 'stories', 'hardship', 'challenges', 'are', 'also', 'sprinkled', 'get', 'hear', 'Tom', 'first', 'battle', 'get', 'record', 'contract', 'when', 'Shelter', 'Records', 'was', 'bought', 'MCA', 'Universal', 'get', 'see', 'various', 'versions', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Heartbreakers', 'take', 'shape', 'various', 'reasons', 'Stan', 'slowly', 'falling', 'sword', 'Howie', 'drug', 'problems', 'fact', 'very', 'surprising', 'just', 'how', 'multi-faceted', 'telling', 'stories', 'Rather', 'give', 'sanitized', 'corporate', 'version', 'how', 'so-and-so', 'was', 'kicked', 'group', 'documentary', 'clips', 'parties', 'be', 'included', 'so', 'can', 'hear', 'horse', 'mouth', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'really', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'love', 'know', 'much', 'story', 'possible', 'am', 'instinctively', 'distrustful', 'one-sided', 'portrayals.As', 'music', 'documentary', 'music', 'large', 'part', 'film', 'depth', 'bredth', 'Tom', 'career', 'shown', 'not', 'just', 'songs', 'collaborations', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'Roger', 'Maguin', 'George', 'Harrison', 'Jeff', 'Lynn', 'many', 'others', 'course', 'include', 'supergroup', 'Travelling', 'Wilburys', 'have', 'add', 'George', 'Harrison', 'Jeff', 'Lynn', 'venerable', 'names', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'really', 'amazing', 'bit', 'music', 'best', 'popular', 'artists', 'last', '50', 'years', 'represented', 'here.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'also', 'a4-Disc', 'Setwhich', 'rare', 'audio', 'tracks', 'more', 'special', 'features', 'So', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'set', 'was', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'sale', 'way', 'great', 'film', 'should', 'seek', 'out.Highly', 'recommended.Enjoy']",Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers - Runnin' Down A Dream (4-Disc Set)

This is clearly a self-financed puff piece.That said, it is a very well done puff piece.What holds it together is the incredible archival material they dug up, mastered into HD widescreen.  A bit of George Harrison interview prior to his death.  Details seemingly lost to time are explained by Harrison, from the grave.Excellent, rare concert footage and audio from the 70s and 80s.  More studio footage from 1982, 1985, 1994.  Wilburys rehearsing at Dylan's house in 1989.  The video surprises keep on coming.  They have a wealth of material to tell this story on the screen.The story though is a little cheesy.  It's clearly not edited by a neutral observer.  It has a positive sheen to everything.  What becomes very weird, after all the buildup, is Tom's dictator / CEO role vs his band-mates and co-writers.From a band dynamics perspective, Tom comes off surprisingly tough and heartless.  His band members are his employees, and never once credits them with helping to compose ""his"" music.  Not much of a plural story.  Some of the best insights are from record company executives.It gets a little sappy and gratuitous.  Cameos from Stevie Nicks.  Johnny Depp, Eddie Vedder.  Stan Lynch, the drummer who left in 1993, is heavily featured in the movie, which is good because he provides some much needed counterpoint.  Lynch's uneven drumming was clearly a part of the classic Petty sound that became world famous.

I have never owned a Tom Petty album, and am highly unlikely to ever own one. Yet I think this was one of the best rock documentaries ever made,and I was fascinated throughout.You see, this is not a concert, but the story of a band. Just because you're not a fan of an artists music doesn't mean they don't have a great story to tell, and this one does. It was directed by 70's wunderkind Peter Bogdonovich, and he does a beautiful job at giving Tom's 35 year career the epic scope that he, and the audience deserved. For once, a film is able to go into the depth of detail that you wanted to know. Why did the drummer get fired? They actually tell you. There's nothing more frustrating than a film that doesn't tell you what you want to know, but this one does.The band itself, is not terribly charismatic, and there isn't much in the ""Motley Crue"" vein of wild stories of excess or soap opera-style conflict and controversy, they are just some quiet guys who like to play easy-listening roots-rock without any gimmicks or sensationalism. But it's rarely boring, especially for musicians, since there's lots of detail given on the making and recording of the albums.I may not be a Tom Petty fan, and did find myself fast-forwarding through some of the extended music performances, but look at it this way, if I was interested and entertained throughout, than a Petty fan is sure to be in heaven.

""And I think we've matured in a way that we're maybe better now, you know, maybe better musicians, and enjoying our craft more than we ever have. So I'm very lucky.""  Tom PettyI found this four hour anthology of Tom Petty and his Heartbreakers on Sundance Channel.  I immediately notified my best friend, and we watched unbelievably spellbound.  This story of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers was directed by Peter Bogdanovich. He begins with the start of Tom Petty's life in Gainesville, Florida and ends with a 2006 commemoration concert of his thirtieth anniversary in music.The entire story is told through home movies, television shows and rememberances in narrative form. Tom Petty does much of the narrative and this is his profession and  musical life, after all. The list of friends, colleagues and those in the know who knew or played with Tom Petty is remarkable. It is a time line of the history of rock and music. Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, George Harrison, and Jeff Lynn along with Tom Petty join to form 'The Traveling Wilburys'.  This remarkable group, to a one, votes this time in their lives as one of the most rewarding musical experiences.  Stevie Nicks wants to join Tom Petty and his heartbreakers, but she is a woman and ""this is a men's club"" says Tom Petty.  The sheer sense of Tom's persuasive personality in pursing his career in music is pure genius. Once he set down this path he never looked back. This was his life and what a life it has been.This movie is about the music. There is some mention of marriage and Tom Petty's daughter is interviewed. Little personal information is shared. What we do have is the music and it is glorious.

1114624,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B000XPNZTK,Spider Monkey,"[0, 0]","Runnin' Down A Dream is the superb 30th anniversary documentary from acclaimed director Peter Bogdanovich. It provides a four hour documentary across two DVDs, where you get the full story of the band and some brilliant interviews with Petty and other of the Heartbreakers. Petty comes across as an extremely likeable guy, with a great deal of integrity and it is great to see someone I admire so much talking so candidly about his career. The third DVD is the 30th anniversary concert from Gainsville, Florida, Tom's hometown, and shows just how wonderful he is live and how he can still whip up a crowd and hold them spellbound. Finally the forth disc is a soundtrack CD and has a good selection of his songs from over the years. This is a great package, with an excellent booklet and additional picture cards, that tells the story of who is now a rock and roll institution. A great place to get the full story from the people who truly know how it happened. Insightful, fun and damn good rock music, what more could you ask for?

While it contains plenty of Tom Petty music, the movie is mainly a documentary about Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. The first part is interesting with original video of the band in their early days. I learned quite a bit about their origins and struggles.About mid-way through you can tell  Peter Bogdanovich, the director, is fudging the facts. The Bob Dylan tour years get a cursory view, and some in-depth on Travelling Wilburys is provided. After that we are given press release statements about ""Howie"" and his ""problem."" Why not just say what happened?After the mid-90s part of Tom Petty's career, the movie went down hill with talking heads about how real, authentic, emotional, and real Tom is.

1114626,A10PC6OX6CEHZV,B000XPNZTK,Steve W.,"[0, 0]","I remember liking the music that Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers made when they first came along.  My rock and roll listening years coincide pretty much with their history.  And I'm from central Florida too, so it made it a little more special I guess that they were a good band.  I remember the buzz that ""damn the torpedoes"" created when it came out.  So many great songs on one album didn't seem possible.  But to be fair, I didn't try to be an expert on them.  I'm not an expert on much of anything.  But if you were young during the 60's and 70's, and you liked listening to fm radio, then you can better judge my qualifications.  But I do remember an early thought, that Tom Petty sounded like one of Bob Dylan's incarnations.The biographical movie (the product being reviewed) is good.  It's made in modern times, so you get some good quality sound and video for your home system.  I enjoy this modern way to enjoy rock and roll, and own several other dvd format covers of rock legends.  This one on Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers is a good mix of talk and music.  It's pretty much all positive perspective, so I'd guess it was conceived and financed by themselves (Tom Petty).  That doesn't bother me, because it delivers good entertainment value, and I already liked the music.  I wasn't looking for someone to knock them down anyway.I'm sort of old now, but I was paying attention when the Beatles were still new and Ed Sullivan was important, ""The times, they are a changin"" was being covered in all the grade school talent shows, and everyone knew who Roy Orbison was.  So when the Traveling Wilburys popped up, and the album was great....that was a great joy for me.  Tom Petty seems to understand how special that opportunity was for him, which I'm happy to know.The ""other"" disc is a concert in Gainesville, Florida.  It features the modern band line up (which is fine).  As a historical document, it's unfortunate that Petty doesn't look well and seems medicated (to me).  Everyone will have their favorite songs, so I won't try to add something meaningful here.  But I will say, I enjoyed watching another concert video from much earlier in their career that was killer.  Search for Santa Monica New Years concert 1978.  The band is really good live.I got one of those email reminders to go to amazon and review this purchase.  So I'm here, but I can't really offer anything more profound that what others have said.  Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers have released some great songs and albums.  There are unrecognized gems that never get heard.  One of my favorites is their cover of Dylan's ""License to Kill"" for his 30 year all star concert.  You can watch it on a youtube search.  It really grabs me in a way I can't explain....",5,the heartbreakers make some great music....,1318118400,"10 9, 2011",2011,2748,"['remember', 'liking', 'music', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Heartbreakers', 'made', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'along', 'rock', 'roll', 'listening', 'years', 'coincide', 'pretty', 'much', 'history', ""'m"", 'central', 'Florida', 'too', 'made', 'little', 'more', 'special', 'guess', 'were', 'good', 'band', 'remember', 'buzz', 'damn', 'torpedoes', 'created', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'So', 'many', 'great', 'songs', 'one', 'album', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'possible', 'be', 'fair', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'expert', ""'m"", 'not', 'expert', 'much', 'anything', 'were', 'young', '60', '70', 'liked', 'listening', 'fm', 'radio', 'then', 'can', 'better', 'judge', 'qualifications', 'do', 'remember', 'early', 'thought', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'sounded', 'one', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'incarnations.The', 'biographical', 'movie', 'product', 'being', 'reviewed', 'good', 'made', 'modern', 'times', 'get', 'good', 'quality', 'sound', 'video', 'home', 'system', 'enjoy', 'modern', 'way', 'enjoy', 'rock', 'roll', 'own', 'several', 'other', 'dvd', 'format', 'covers', 'rock', 'legends', 'one', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Heartbreakers', 'good', 'mix', 'talk', 'music', 'pretty', 'much', 'positive', 'perspective', ""'d"", 'guess', 'was', 'conceived', 'financed', 'Tom', 'Petty', ""n't"", 'bother', 'good', 'entertainment', 'value', 'already', 'liked', 'music', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'someone', 'knock', 'down', 'anyway.I', ""'m"", 'sort', 'old', 'now', 'was', 'paying', 'attention', 'when', 'Beatles', 'were', 'still', 'new', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'was', 'important', 'times', 'are', 'changin', 'was', 'being', 'covered', 'grade', 'school', 'talent', 'shows', 'everyone', 'knew', 'who', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'was', 'So', 'when', 'Traveling', 'Wilburys', 'popped', 'up', 'album', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'great', 'joy', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'understand', 'how', 'special', 'opportunity', 'was', ""'m"", 'happy', 'know.The', 'other', 'disc', 'concert', 'Gainesville', 'Florida', 'modern', 'band', 'line', 'fine', 'historical', 'document', 'unfortunate', 'Petty', ""n't"", 'look', 'well', 'medicated', 'Everyone', 'will', 'have', 'favorite', 'songs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'try', 'add', 'something', 'meaningful', 'here', 'will', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'concert', 'video', 'much', 'earlier', 'career', 'was', 'killer', 'Search', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'New', 'Years', 'concert', '1978', 'band', 'really', 'good', 'live.I', 'got', 'one', 'email', 'reminders', 'go', 'amazon', 'review', 'purchase', ""'m"", 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'offer', 'anything', 'more', 'profound', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Heartbreakers', 'have', 'released', 'great', 'songs', 'albums', 'are', 'unrecognized', 'gems', 'never', 'get', 'heard', 'One', 'favorites', 'cover', 'Dylan', 'License', 'Kill', '30', 'year', 'star', 'concert', 'can', 'watch', 'youtube', 'search', 'really', 'grabs', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain']",Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers - Runnin' Down A Dream (4-Disc Set)
