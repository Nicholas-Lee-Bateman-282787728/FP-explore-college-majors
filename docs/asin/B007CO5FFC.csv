1529919,AW1493ZQTQ2ET,B007CO5FFC,Irfan A. Alvi,"[1, 1]","Let me tell you how engrossing this series is: my wife and I watched all 12 episodes of Season 1 in ONE day!Reflecting on why we got so hooked, I think it's mostly due to the decadent Machiavellian characters, a storyline that really makes you want to know what happens next, and the over-the-top sexuality and language.  I've never seen anything else like this on TV, and the creators clearly had an intention to stretch the boundaries.But reflecting further, the series definitely has some substantial weaknesses which knock off a star and prevent it from becoming a classic.  First and foremast, I think the creators have simply stretched everything too far, to the extent that the characters aren't quite believable and come across more like caricatures (the character of Marty is the most believable, mainly due to Don Cheadle's superb acting).  This prevents us from developing a connection with the characters (again, except for perhaps Marty).  The second weakness is that the seedy side of management consulting seems to be exaggerated.  For example, the senior partners seem to just sit around in their large offices and not do any work, Marty gets away with being rather abusive towards clients, Marty runs into his ex-wife and rival consultant way too often (as though there aren't thousands of consultants around), drug use is rampant, etc., etc.So, after all this, you might think I didn't care much for the series, but of course the way it sucked me in indicates otherwise - the strengths clearly outweigh the weaknesses.  And now I eagerly look forward to what Season 2 will bring as well.PS - This series is based on the book of the same title, but many liberties have been taken in adapting the book to the screen.

Everything about the characters is so wrong, the comedy is so dark and the situations are so screwed up that it screams like it needs a pressure valve.I've worked with management consultancies in real life and can attest to the shadiness of their operations - they are primarily groups of questionably talented but intelligent people looking to drum up work from C-level executives who don't know their own business. The shows starts with such a group, shakes them empty of any sort of moral compass, adds plenty of sex and alcohol and goes from there.Each episode focuses on a different industry and illustrates a new and complicated way to screw the client over. There are a few overarching plot threads between the characters' personal lives and threats manifesting in their company. The main four characters are perfectly cast though to me it's Don Cheadle's performance of a lifetime. The parts where Cheadle talks directly to the audience help create an immense likability for his character, even though we know we shouldn't.Needless to say, this isn't a comedy for everyone but personally I enjoyed it so much that I watched the entire season in a weekend. It irreverently skewers nonsense in the business world and highlights the lives of consultants who operates invisibly in large companies, adding no value whatsoever but calving out their paycheck in a horrible perversion of survival of the fittest.

1529927,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B007CO5FFC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[18, 20]","Without a doubt, Showtime's ""House of Lies"" was one of my most eagerly awaited programs of 2012. Headlined by Don Cheadle and Kristen Bell, the previews for this blistering sitcom looked bawdy, over-the-top, and merciless. There's nothing that I enjoy more than brutal satire, dark humor, and pushing the boundaries of traditional television. So my expectations were through the roof. And for the most part, I was completely satisfied (if not instantly blown away) with the end result. By being on Showtime, ""House of Lies"" definitely makes the most of its adult situations with outrageous language, unrepentant viciousness, and frank sexual discussions and partnerships. In many ways, though, I felt ""House of Lies"" trying too hard to be provocative. Everything is done at such extremes, the program rarely settles enough to get you to actually care about its protagonists. They are a questionable bunch, to be sure, but I'd have appreciated a few more grounded moments amidst the mayhem to make the show feel a bit more well rounded. Don't get me wrong. I still thoroughly enjoyed this decidedly brutal comedy, it just lacked the fine tuning necessary to make it one of TV's best.At its most successful, ""House of Lies"" skewers business culture, office politics, and the cutthroat nature of getting ahead at any cost. Cheadle plays a ruthless business consultant whose team includes Bell, Ben Schwartz, and Josh Lawson. This quartet is the backbone of the show and each episode showcases them finessing the art of the deal using unscrupulous tactics. The role of the business consultant can be varied, but essentially the team is looking to be hired to provide the outside expertise on any number of topics involving efficiency. They will do anything to secure the job and whatever it takes to keep the client satisfied. Although heightened for maximum humor, ""House of Lies"" actually paints a pretty convincing portrait of this environment! The show, as it progresses, also deals with changes within Cheadle's own firm that may compromise his position as a top dog earner. In these business negotiations, the camera often freezes the action so that Cheadle can school the viewer on the latest manipulation or corporate doublespeak. The dialogue itself is smart, witty, profane, and unexpectedly cutting. It is certainly not for someone with a sensitive constitution.Cheadle is clearly having the time of his life. Completely unrestrained, he chews the scenery in every take and is wickedly funny. Bell, as an actress, seems to be finding her way and I wish someone would stop trying to make her the next Katherine Heigl in films. She was designed for edgier fare, and this absolutely suits what she should be doing. Smarmy Ben Schwartz gets some of the best lines (and he's perfecting this kind of jerk role) and his childish competitions with Lawson provide some of the show's most memorable moments. And as the dramatic stakes rise with Cheadle's future hanging in the balance, great character actors Griffen Dunne and Greg Germann get a chance to shine as corporate bigwigs. Seriously, anything having to do with a workplace setting really works.I'm not as convinced, though, by the elements meant to humanize Cheadle. His home life is molded in the only-on-TV model with one of the most precocious, offbeat, and wizened TV kids that you're likely to encounter. I never much believed or cared about the aspects of his private life which never held the zing of the livelier segments. They also try to establish a romantic entanglement, but as she moves in almost immediately to raise his kid--nothing feels very organic. His ex-wife is played with ferocity by Dawn Olivieri (who is also a rival consultant) and the two are constantly at war. I like Olivieri, but this might be one plot point too many. When we're stuck in Cheadle's home life, we miss being at work! Although I didn't always love ""House of Lies,"" I appreciated the chances that it took. As an adult comedy, it's not perfect.

1529928,ALCKYWSV2ZTTC,B007CO5FFC,Latricia Finley,"[0, 0]","So, I've read a couple of reviews and it prompted me to want to write one of my own. I will keep this brief. One reviewer claims that the show relies to heavily on sex to mask the fact that there is no legit story line. (I'm paraphrasing).  I disagree 100%. You're looking for a story? Where shall I begin? There is this whole world of consulting which seems to have bred these greedy, crass, and brilliant a-holes. Marty, his back story, the entire story of his family, past and present. His son, his dad, his crazy ex-wife? Jeanie and Marty's relationship. Marty's relationship with his pod and his superiors. His clients. I mean there is so much. The sex is just a by product of the lifestyle these people live. On top of all that, I don't think this show is meant to be some brilliant commentary on life and live. It's a comedy and it succeeds as such. This is one of the funniest shows I've seen this year. I realize now, that I have been watching mostly dramas. It make me laugh out loud every couple of minutes. When I'm not laughing, I'm sitting there with my mouth wide open and my eyes glued to the screen. It only gets more outrageous as the seasons go on.

1529930,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B007CO5FFC,Mark Turner,"[3, 4]","I really wanted to hate this series. Honestly I did. Within seconds of the shows credits hitting the screen there it was, the first of many nude scenes. I've always felt that the inclusion of extreme nudity or language was the first sign of a poorly made show/special trying to aim for the lowest common denominator right out of the chute. There are even web sites dedicated to counting the seconds it takes for a made for cable series/special to include a nude scene. For once my theory was wrong. While I wanted to not like this series I found myself compelled to continue watching episode after episode and wondering what happened when season one ended.HOUSE OF LIES is about Marty Kaan (Don Cheadle), a fast talking, fast thinking management consultant and his team. What do management consultants do? Watch and see as periodically everything on screen freezes with the exception of Marty who then talks to you, the viewer, to explain something going on. What a management consultant does is one of those times. Basically it boils down to telling the client what they want to hear, stroking their egos, taking what they want and filtering it through the company and then giving it right back to them while charging them for doing nothing more than telling them what they wanted to hear from the start. In essence they do little but get paid tremendous salaries for doing so.Marty's team is a well oiled machine with each person knowing their job and doing it well. Second in command and possibly being groomed to take Marty's place one day is Jeanne Van Der Hooven (Kristin Bell), a smart young woman who knows how to put everything together to present to the client. She still has some rough edges yet and as the show begins is one of the few people with a tad left of her scruples but that could change at any time. Next is Clyde Oberholt (Ben Schwartz), a smooth talker who can put together a power point package like no one else. Last in line is Doug Guggenheim (Josh Lawson) the team geek. Lawson can gather information faster than anyone and assemble it in whatever form you need, making good numbers look bad and bad look good.Marty and his team fly out from their main office throughout the week to meet with clients trying to find new ways to improve their companies, to filter through ideas they have to see if they might work and to bill those clients as much and as often as possible. At the same time there is competition from other management consultants, the worst of which is ranked above the company Marty works for and whose top consultant is Marty's ex-wife Monica Talbot (Dawn Olivieri). That would be bad enough but Monica also happens to be a tad insane and a cut throat competitor. To make it even more complicated, Monica and Marty occasionally still find themselves in bed together from the series opening sequence through several episodes.If that wasn't enough story to hold your interest then put into play one more thing that is slowly making Marty insane, his home life. There you'll find Marty's son Roscoe (Donis Leonard Jr.), a cross dressing junior high student who's in the midst of discovering himself. Helping Marty raise his son is Marty's father and ex-psychiatrist Jeremiah (Glynn Turman), a man who doesn't hold back what's on his mind but who loves his son deeply.Each episode finds the team trying to take on the problems of a different company and each challenge has them finding new ways to deal with the problems that come up in doing so. Some involve things as simple as the competitor arriving at the same time to dealing with a racist CEO who won't give Marty the time of day. A thread that runs through the whole season revolves around the CFO of a company that Marty and his team take on in the first episode and who he accidentally embarrasses when his wife has sex with Marty's date in the ladies room. The same character in trying to exact revenge convinces his bosses that buying out the company Marty works for would be to their advantage. The prospect of losing his job and his team's as well becomes one of the central focus points of nearly each episode.There you have it, a rather lengthy description of what the basics of the show involve. So what makes it worth watching? Narrowing that down to one thing is impossible and to break it down to two is difficult but I'll try. First and foremost is the writing. This show has some of the most crisp dialogue I've ever seen. Not a word is wasted and the back and forth patter between characters as well as the revealing dialogues are amazing to listen to. Sure there are plenty of expletives uttered but between them coming out fast and furious and the amount of sexual activity on screen it becomes little more than background noise. The words used here are formed so well that it almost comes off like a song instead of just talking. There is a flow and pacing that makes each sentence something to listen to.The second thing that stands out here is the acting. Cheadle has always been a favorite of mine doing some great work in the past. He shines here as Marty displaying not just the smooth talking conman of a consultant but offering up the unhappy and slowly unhinging person beneath that false face. The title of the show doesn't just sum up what their business is all about, it's a reference to the home life that Marty has, the place where he hopes he can be the best father and son possible but where he inevitably fails. Is there a possibility that Marty can turn his life around and be what he wants at home and still be successful at work? That's the main question posed from episode one to the last.The supporting actors are just as amazing. Each one has their own quirks that they bring to the story and to the team. Best of all is Bell who shows that while her character may be one of the few with a conscious she's also falling into the same cesspool that her fellow co-workers seem to excel in. While she has the skills to possibly be the next Marty Kaan, does she really want to become that?If you are easily offended then this series is not at all something you should watch. The scenes of sexually active characters starts seconds in the opening show and filters through each episode, some graphic and others not quite so. The language is always filled with expletives and the F bomb is dropped more than any ammo used in all world wars combined. If you can get past that though you'll find a series that is incredibly well written, acting that is the top of the heap and so interesting that you'll find yourself skipping the credits and cueing up the next episode as the one you're watching ends. The only problem here is waiting till season two comes out to see what happens next.",5,AMAZING WRITING,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,6716,"['really', 'wanted', 'hate', 'series', 'Honestly', 'did',
