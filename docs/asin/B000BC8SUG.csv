What is lacking is the absence of any stage design whatsoever which could improve the overall performance and the Dolby Digital 2.0 soundtrack,which could be more impressive had it been remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 .Nevertheless if you are into smooth jazz,play this and you are in for a pleasant evening.",4,Have a Pleasant Evening !,1147737600,"05 16, 2006",2006,608,"['special', 'collaboration', 'four', 'masters', 'smooth', 'jazz', 'performing', 'live', 'recording', 'studio', 'true', 'delight', 'terms', 'musicianship.The', 'tracklist', 'mixed', 'bag', 'songs', 'most', 'are', 'favourites:101', 'Eastbound', 'Chant', 'Dance', 'Bali', 'Run', 'Between', 'Sheets', 'Amoroso', 'What', 'lacking', 'absence', 'stage', 'design', 'whatsoever', 'could', 'improve', 'overall', 'performance', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0', 'soundtrack', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'impressive', 'had', 'been', 'remastered', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', '.Nevertheless', 'are', 'smooth', 'jazz', 'play', 'are', 'pleasant', 'evening']",N/A
