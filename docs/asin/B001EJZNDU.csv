The story picks up several years after the events of ""Ruby in the Smoke"", and much has changed in the lives of Sally and her friends.Setting herself up in her own accountancy business, Sally (Billie Piper) has little time for crime-solving... instead handing over that mantle to Frederick Garland (JJ Feild), who now dabbles in amateur detectives along with Jim (Matt Smith).  Rosa (Hayley Atwell) has married Reverend Bedwell (David Harewood), so naturally Fred wishes to know when Sally wants to set their own wedding date.  Even if Sally wanted to, the events that are about to unravel will delay their plans...Fred and Jim are asked to help protect a magician, Alistair MacKinnon (Julian Rhind-Tutt), who believes he is being stalked by a person he has seen committing a murder in a vision, which is also experienced by clairvoyant Nellie Budd (Dona Kroll); whilst Sally's latest client has lost thousands of pounds in a bankrupt shipping firm.  Could the two incidents be linked?SHADOW IN THE NORTH is a deliciously darker, densely-packed story which in many ways is more satisfying than the earlier ""Ruby in the Smoke"".  Populating SHADOW... are some fascinating characters, and there is a moodier edge to the events in this film.I'm not sure why the BBC decided to cut short their series of ""Sally Lockhart Mysteries"".  One suspects it was mainly a budgeting problem (design-wise it seems that nothing was spared on the screen in either ""Ruby..."" or ""Shadow..."").  The way things are left at the climax of SHADOW..., however, there is a satisfying closure.  Despite this, author Philip Pullman beautifully continued Sally's story for two additional books, filling in the fate of vanished orphan Adelaide in the fourth instalment, ""The Tin Princess"".",4,second thrill-packed adventure for Sally and the gang,1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,1905,"['SHADOW', 'IN', 'THE', 'NORTH', 'BBC', 'second', 'sadly', 'last', 'Sally', 'Lockhart', 'Mysteries', 'series', 'based', 'novels', 'Philip', 'Pullman', 'story', 'up', 'several', 'years', 'events', 'Ruby', 'Smoke', 'much', 'changed', 'lives', 'Sally', 'friends.Setting', 'up', 'own', 'accountancy', 'business', 'Sally', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'little', 'time', 'crime-solving', 'instead', 'handing', 'over', 'mantle', 'Frederick', 'Garland', 'JJ', 'Feild', 'who', 'now', 'amateur', 'detectives', 'Jim', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'Rosa', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'married', 'Reverend', 'Bedwell', 'David', 'Harewood', 'so', 'naturally', 'Fred', 'know', 'when', 'Sally', 'set', 'own', 'wedding', 'date', 'Even', 'Sally', 'wanted', 'events', 'are', 'unravel', 'will', 'delay', 'plans', 'Fred', 'Jim', 'are', 'asked', 'help', 'protect', 'magician', 'Alistair', 'MacKinnon', 'Julian', 'Rhind-Tutt', 'who', 'being', 'stalked', 'person', 'seen', 'committing', 'murder', 'vision', 'also', 'experienced', 'clairvoyant', 'Nellie', 'Budd', 'Dona', 'Kroll', 'Sally', 'latest', 'client', 'lost', 'thousands', 'pounds', 'bankrupt', 'shipping', 'firm', 'Could', 'two', 'incidents', 'be', 'linked', 'SHADOW', 'IN', 'THE', 'NORTH', 'deliciously', 'darker', 'densely-packed', 'story', 'many', 'ways', 'more', 'satisfying', 'earlier', 'Ruby', 'Smoke', 'Populating', 'SHADOW', 'are', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'moodier', 'edge', 'events', 'film.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'BBC', 'decided', 'cut', 'short', 'series', 'Sally', 'Lockhart', 'Mysteries', 'One', 'was', 'mainly', 'budgeting', 'problem', 'design-wise', 'nothing', 'was', 'spared', 'screen', 'Ruby', 'Shadow', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'left', 'climax', 'SHADOW', 'however', 'satisfying', 'closure', 'author', 'Philip', 'Pullman', 'beautifully', 'continued', 'Sally', 'story', 'two', 'additional', 'books', 'filling', 'fate', 'vanished', 'orphan', 'Adelaide', 'fourth', 'instalment', 'Tin', 'Princess']",The Sally Lockhart Mysteries - Shadow in the North

Billie Piper does an excellent job of player the character of a young woman who smart, determined to get to the truth, and equally determined not to be told by society what her limitations as a woman are. Her friends are great additions to the ensemble cast.Part of what makes this episode so good is the villain in the mystery. He is amoral and frightening. When he discovers how intelligent Sally (Billy Piper) is and that she has been able to track him as the person responsible for her client's missing investment money, he decides to offer a proposal of marriage. He offers a few threats along with the proposal and thinks that she will cave in to him.Thanks to the villain someone close to Sally is killed. She is determined to make him pay for her loss and she does it in a very clever way that he doesn't see coming. Sally is courageous in many ways, especially for the time period she lived in.

1185912,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B001EJZNDU,D. S. Thurlow,"[12, 14]","""The Shadow in the North"" is the second Masterpiece Theater installment of the Sally Lockhart Mysteries, based on the novels by Philip Pullman.  Sally Lockhart (Billie Piper from ""Mansfield Park"") is a very independent, and very unusual, self-employed female living in Victorian England.  Sally bills herself as a financial consultant, but she and her photographer boyfriend Fred (JJ Feild from ""Northanger Abbey"") and their would-be playwright friend Jim are really a private detective agency.The case begins with two separate threads, a old woman seeking restitution for the bankruptcy of a shipping firm, and a Scottish magician seeking protection from a mysterious man whom he saw commit a murder in a vision.  Sally and Fred pursue their respective investigations, only to find them intertwining in the person of an exceedingly ruthless businessman named Axel Bellman.  Bellman does not take kindly to being investigated, and will threaten Sally's reputation, her friends, and her life, before making her a shocking offer.  The ending of this complicated and hard-boiled mystery features more than one plot twist.The story is richly populated with a variety of Victorian-era characters, including a wealthy heiress, a woman who conducts surprisingly insightful seances, a seamtress who hides from the light, a mystified patent clerk, and a few dangerous thugs.  The narrative is melodramatic and sometimes awkwardly modern, with an ending that would seem contrived were it not for the studious attention paid to the occult aspects of the story.""The Shadow in the North"" is highly recommended as an entertaining and different installment of Masterpiece Mystery.",4,Shadows Everywhere....,1222560000,"09 28, 2008",2008,1665,"['Shadow', 'North', 'second', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'installment', 'Sally', 'Lockhart', 'Mysteries', 'based', 'novels', 'Philip', 'Pullman', 'Sally', 'Lockhart', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'very', 'independent', 'very', 'unusual', 'self-employed', 'female', 'living', 'Victorian', 'England', 'Sally', 'bills', 'financial', 'consultant', 'photographer', 'boyfriend', 'Fred', 'JJ', 'Feild', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'would-be', 'playwright', 'friend', 'Jim', 'are', 'really', 'private', 'detective', 'agency.The', 'case', 'two', 'separate', 'threads', 'old', 'woman', 'seeking', 'restitution', 'bankruptcy', 'shipping', 'firm', 'Scottish', 'magician', 'seeking', 'protection', 'mysterious', 'man', 'whom', 'saw', 'commit', 'murder', 'vision', 'Sally', 'Fred', 'pursue', 'respective', 'investigations', 'only', 'find', 'intertwining', 'person', 'exceedingly', 'ruthless', 'businessman', 'named', 'Axel', 'Bellman', 'Bellman', 'not', 'take', 'kindly', 'being', 'investigated', 'will', 'threaten', 'Sally', 'reputation', 'friends', 'life', 'making', 'shocking', 'offer', 'ending', 'complicated', 'hard-boiled', 'mystery', 'more', 'one', 'plot', 'twist.The', 'story', 'richly', 'populated', 'variety', 'Victorian-era', 'characters', 'including', 'wealthy', 'heiress', 'woman', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'insightful', 'seances', 'seamtress', 'who', 'light', 'mystified', 'patent', 'clerk', 'few', 'dangerous', 'thugs', 'narrative', 'melodramatic', 'sometimes', 'awkwardly', 'modern', 'ending', 'would', 'seem', 'contrived', 'were', 'not', 'studious', 'attention', 'paid', 'occult', 'aspects', 'story', 'Shadow', 'North', 'highly', 'recommended', 'entertaining', 'different', 'installment', 'Masterpiece', 'Mystery']",The Sally Lockhart Mysteries - Shadow in the North

After all she does want to show that she can protray other characters than Rose Tyler, which she also did a pretty good job in.  I can understand her not wanting to get married, even though she loves him.  A woman still gave up mostly everything.  If this took place later like after women got the right to vote and got other rights, such as keeping own money etc, if would be different.  After reading one review, I did'nt know that he proposed to her and she accepted. That review said it was in the BBC version. It must be that he had no attention of changing her and taking her money, etc and would even have it be put in writing, making it legal.  What a shame (for those of you who have not watched it, don't read this any further) that he died, but it's great that she is having his child.  But maybe she can say it's someone else's and she adopted it, not that she would care what poeple would say about her, but this takes place in the 1880's where children not born in wedlock as they put it were treated badly by so-called christian people.

1185915,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B001EJZNDU,mirasreviews,"[22, 24]","""The Shadow in the North"" is adapted from the 2nd book in Philip Pulman's ""Sally Lockhart Mysteries"" series, which cast an intrepid young woman as an unlikely detective in Victorian England. It takes place in 1878, 6 years after ""The Ruby in the Smoke"". Sally Lockhart (Billie Piper) is now in her early 20s and has gone into business for herself as a financial consultant. Fred Garland (J.J. Feild), meanwhile, is officially in the detective business with Jim Taylor (Matt Smith). An elderly client of Sally's suspects fraud when she loses her savings on a seemingly solid investment, so Sally sets out to determine if there is something sinister behind the Swedish businessman Axel Bellman (Jared Lewis) who walked away from the bankruptcy. A conjurer named Alistair MacKinnon (Julian Rhind-Tutt) insists to Fred and Jim that he is being pursued by a murderer he saw in a vision, who is none other than Mr. Bellman.This BBC production of ""The Shadow in the North"" allows for much more intricacy of plot and character development than its predecessorThe Ruby in the Smoke, which had to devote most of its time to introducing characters. Sally is reluctant to give up her hard-earned independence so shuns any thought of marriage to Fred Garland, who is obviously in love with her. Glimpses of the popular spiritualist movement and Bram Stoker at the Lyceum Theatre are fun historical references. The ""steam gun"" at the center of the mysteries was apparently inspired by the real Nordenfelt Gun, a multi-barrel machine gun produced in the 1870s by Thorsten Nordenfelt, whose name resembles the fictional inventor of the steam gun, Arne Nordenfels. Sally is more worldly, confident, and perhaps more stubborn than she was at 16, and overall this mystery is less rushed, more satisfying, and the mix of characters from all walks of life creates a nice balance.",5,A Great Mix of Characters Make This a Stand-Out Adaptation.,1222732800,"09 30, 2008",2008,1858,"['Shadow', 'North', 'adapted', '2nd', 'book', 'Philip', 'Pulman', 'Sally', 'Lockhart', 'Mysteries', 'series', 'cast', 'intrepid', 'young', 'woman', 'unlikely', 'detective', 'Victorian', 'England', 'place', '1878', '6', 'years', 'Ruby', 'Smoke', 'Sally', 'Lockhart', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'now', 'early', '20s', 'gone', 'business', 'herself', 'financial', 'consultant', 'Fred', 'Garland', 'J.J.', 'Feild', 'meanwhile', 'officially', 'detective', 'business', 'Jim', 'Taylor', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'elderly', 'client', 'Sally', 'suspects', 'fraud', 'when', 'savings', 'seemingly', 'solid', 'investment', 'so', 'Sally', 'out', 'determine', 'something', 'sinister', 'Swedish', 'businessman', 'Axel', 'Bellman', 'Jared', 'Lewis', 'who', 'walked', 'away', 'bankruptcy', 'conjurer', 'named', 'Alistair', 'MacKinnon', 'Julian', 'Rhind-Tutt', 'Fred', 'Jim', 'being', 'pursued', 'murderer', 'saw', 'vision', 'who', 'none', 'other', 'Mr.', 'Bellman.This', 'BBC', 'production', 'Shadow', 'North', 'much', 'more', 'intricacy', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'predecessorThe', 'Ruby', 'Smoke', 'had', 'devote', 'most', 'time', 'introducing', 'characters', 'Sally', 'reluctant', 'give', 'up', 'hard-earned', 'independence', 'so', 'thought', 'marriage', 'Fred', 'Garland', 'who', 'obviously', 'love', 'Glimpses', 'popular', 'spiritualist', 'movement', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'Lyceum', 'Theatre', 'are', 'fun', 'historical', 'references', 'steam', 'gun', 'center', 'mysteries', 'was', 'apparently', 'inspired', 'real', 'Nordenfelt', 'Gun', 'multi-barrel', 'machine', 'gun', 'produced', '1870s', 'Thorsten', 'Nordenfelt', 'name', 'fictional', 'inventor', 'steam', 'gun', 'Arne', 'Nordenfels', 'Sally', 'more', 'worldly', 'confident', 'perhaps', 'more', 'stubborn', 'was', '16', 'overall', 'mystery', 'less', 'rushed', 'more', 'satisfying', 'mix', 'characters', 'walks', 'life', 'nice', 'balance']",The Sally Lockhart Mysteries - Shadow in the North
