1371764,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B003Y5H4ZW,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I love Kevin James.  I mean, I think the man is hilarious.  I also really like Vince Vaughn.  Someone does need to warn him that his constant regurgitation of the same comedic character is growing old and that he needs to learn to add a few more layers, but overall his `funny douchebag' routine is working out well for him.  He makes me laugh.  When I saw the trailer for `The Dilemma' all those months ago, it looked really promising.  A dramedy, playing heavily on the comedy aspect (according to the trailer) starring two very funny men and some very talented women looked like it could really be good.  The subject, while in all respective notes NOT funny, could lend itself to astute comedic situations if built upon in the right way.I was excited.The reviews were scathing, and even some word from Ammy friends made me hesitate.  I wasn't going to rush out to this one (which isn't a new thing since I rarely make it to the movies to begin with).  I finally did get around to seeing this this past weekend, and I must say that I was really, really disappointed.There is a spoiler here that I have to give because it helps plead my case.The first problem with `The Dilemma' is that it skews to the serious and tries too hard to insert the funny instead of allowing it to be a natural progression of character.  The situations orchestrated for comedic effect feel forced and out of place because Howard and company are creating an awkwardly thematic production.  The first part of the film was such a confusing ride.  It felt like it was a drama, not a comedy at all, and the romantic tangles of Vaughn and Connelly felt almost `90210' with really good lighting.  It was a strange introduction and then the shift to comedic episodes (the poisonous plant scene) felt off.  I think that the thematic issues would have been more forgivable had the actual dilemma felt more legitimate.  I'm sorry, but if you catch your BEST FRIEND'S wife cheating on him, you tell him immediately.  You don't wait, you don't take his preposterous screaming at you (that scene was just dumb) as an excuse to walk away.  You grab him by the ears and drag him to a room if you have to and then you hold him close and tell him.  There is no dilemma.  The constant back and forth between Vaughn and Ryder felt like an excuse to make this feel more dramatic than it really was.And then you have the fact that James's character wasn't entirely innocent and so it makes you wonder why all the fuss at all (I mean, he's basically doing THE SAME THING).The performances are all uniformly fine.  Sadly, Connelly is in a different movie because she is strictly dramatic and offers no comedic insight whatsoever.  In a way, she gives the best performance of the bunch (Ryder is also very good) because she is always in `tone', but she is also the least interesting.  James is sadly uneven, and Vaughn, while convincing in many instances, suffers from the script.  I just wish that this movie knew what it wanted to be.  It isn't even enough to make it work.The fight scene is epic and made me come close to wetting myself in laughter, but most parts of this film made me feel indifferent.",2,Tonally challenged and emotionally apathetic...,1339977600,"06 18, 2012",2012,3160,"['love', 'Kevin', 'James', 'mean', 'think', 'man', 'hilarious', 'also', 'really', 'like', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Someone', 'need', 'warn', 'constant', 'regurgitation', 'same', 'comedic', 'character', 'growing', 'old', 'learn', 'add', 'few', 'more', 'layers', 'overall', 'funny', 'douchebag', 'routine', 'working', 'out', 'well', 'When', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Dilemma', 'months', 'ago', 'looked', 'really', 'promising', 'dramedy', 'playing', 'heavily', 'comedy', 'aspect', 'according', 'trailer', 'starring', 'two', 'very', 'funny', 'men', 'very', 'talented', 'women', 'looked', 'could', 'really', 'be', 'good', 'subject', 'respective', 'notes', 'NOT', 'funny', 'could', 'lend', 'astute', 'comedic', 'situations', 'built', 'right', 'way.I', 'was', 'excited.The', 'reviews', 'were', 'scathing', 'even', 'word', 'Ammy', 'friends', 'made', 'hesitate', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'rush', 'out', 'one', ""n't"", 'new', 'thing', 'rarely', 'make', 'movies', 'begin', 'finally', 'did', 'get', 'seeing', 'past', 'weekend', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'really', 'really', 'spoiler', 'here', 'have', 'give', 'plead', 'case.The', 'first', 'problem', 'Dilemma', 'serious', 'tries', 'too', 'hard', 'insert', 'funny', 'instead', 'allowing', 'be', 'natural', 'progression', 'character', 'situations', 'orchestrated', 'comedic', 'effect', 'feel', 'forced', 'place', 'Howard', 'company', 'are', 'creating', 'awkwardly', 'thematic', 'production', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'such', 'confusing', 'ride', 'felt', 'was', 'drama', 'not', 'comedy', 'romantic', 'tangles', 'Vaughn', 'Connelly', 'felt', 'almost', '90210', 'really', 'good', 'lighting', 'was', 'strange', 'introduction', 'then', 'shift', 'comedic', 'episodes', 'poisonous', 'plant', 'scene', 'felt', 'off', 'think', 'thematic', 'issues', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'forgivable', 'had', 'actual', 'dilemma', 'felt', 'more', 'legitimate', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'catch', 'BEST', 'FRIEND', 'wife', 'cheating', 'tell', 'immediately', 'do', ""n't"", 'wait', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'preposterous', 'screaming', 'scene', 'was', 'just', 'dumb', 'excuse', 'walk', 'away', 'grab', 'ears', 'drag', 'room', 'have', 'then', 'hold', 'close', 'tell', 'dilemma', 'constant', 'back', 'forth', 'Vaughn', 'Ryder', 'felt', 'excuse', 'make', 'feel', 'more', 'dramatic', 'really', 'then', 'have', 'fact', 'James', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'innocent', 'wonder', 'why', 'fuss', 'mean', 'basically', 'doing', 'THE', 'SAME', 'THING', '.The', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'fine', 'Sadly', 'Connelly', 'different', 'movie', 'strictly', 'dramatic', 'comedic', 'insight', 'whatsoever', 'way', 'best', 'performance', 'bunch', 'Ryder', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'always', 'tone', 'also', 'least', 'interesting', 'James', 'sadly', 'uneven', 'Vaughn', 'convincing', 'many', 'instances', 'suffers', 'script', 'just', 'wish', 'movie', 'knew', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', ""n't"", 'even', 'enough', 'make', 'work.The', 'fight', 'scene', 'epic', 'made', 'come', 'close', 'wetting', 'laughter', 'most', 'parts', 'film', 'made', 'feel', 'indifferent']",The Dilemma
1371765,AGZZM0UG0PPGA,B003Y5H4ZW,"Beeshy ""AliciA""","[2, 4]","K let me start by saying I gave this 3 stars for the potential it had to be funny and the great cast. 2 stars is probably what the rating should actualy be. I hate to say it but it was so not good. For starters don't go in thinking that this is a comedy cause although there are some funny parts I'd consider this a drama.**Spoilers** Let's start w/ Ronny(Vince Vaughn) is dating Beth(Jennifer Connelly) + Nick(Kevin James) is married to Geneva(Winona Ryder). Nick being ""happily"" married encourages Ronny to propose to Beth. So while Ronny is scouting the perfect location he sees Geneva making out w/ Zip(Channing Tatum). Although he wants to tell Nick right away he doesn't because they are under a deadline from work + he knows how stressed he is already. K this part I hated I knew going in the Vince Vaughn finds out and doesn't know what to do but then they show this bromance between Ronny + Nick and you feel like Ronny is just being selfish and you kind of hate him. You're waiting and waiting for him to blurt it out and then they can go on this wacky advventure to bust Geneva and get revenge. Well that doesn't happen far from it in fact. Remember this is a drama not a comedy as advertised. So Ronny starts following Geneva around and catches her at Zip's house and snaps some pics for evidence. K this was funny after Geneva leaves he and Zip get in a battle royale. But then you end up feeling bad for Zip cause even though he knew Geneva was married he feels bad for kicking the husband's best friends butt. Still w/ me? K Ronny has been trying to tell Nick but another wrench is thrown in the works when you find out that he slept w/ Geneva in college. She then threatnens to tell Nick that Ronny has been after her ever since. But since they slept together before Nick + Geneva were together you hate Ronny again for just not telling Nick about that either. And the plot thickens evenmore so.  Ronny had a previous gambling problem and Nick + Beth both think that's what he's up to since he's been running around like a mad man. To top things off you realize that although Geneva is cheating Nick isn't as innocent as you think. Which again makes you even more depressed. So does any of this jump out at you as comedy? Like I said there are some funny parts but they fall to the wayside w/ all this drama. So the movie leads up to an intervention for Ronny where everything is out + Nick hates Ronny for not telling him. They do ""make up"" but again you realize he would have forgiven him anyway + all that drama was for not. And that's what I didn't like since they pushed it so hard as a comedy they could have actually done a funny movie w/ the plot they had but it just didn't go that way.  And I'm sorry but they should have cast someone other than Winona Ryder I just couldn't buy her w/ Kevin James + especially not w/ Channing Tatum. I just kept seeing the crazy eyes everyone is always talking about. Where Vince Vaugh + Jennifer Connelly where totaly believeable as a coulpe. It was just one more thing that made this movie not a winner in my book. So if you wanna test your luck and give it a go I won't stop you but please please keep in mind going in Drama Not Comedy.

As if using every hollywood cliche for relationship comedy wasn't already bad enough, this movie just kept going from bad to worse. For starters why does everyone have to use the stereotype that men are bad communicators and that they don't tell their significant other anything or that all men are rotten cheating scumbags, etc? These are just a few of the many cliches that they highlight in this film and the audience spots them immediately as paper thin plot devices to further a storyline which wasn't great to begin with. And to be honest, bad plot devices can be overlooked if there is a strong plot to back them up, but there are so many subplots and dangling threads that you just want to flush this one down the toilet.From start to finish very little of this movie truly makes sense, probably because there's so much filler here just to make the 111 minutes. Don't even bother finishing this one either because the ending will leave you completely unsatisfied. The movie closes with the ""dilemma"" left completely unresolved and women portrayed as cheating whores while forgetting that the male was also a cheat.

1371769,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003Y5H4ZW,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 4]","""The Dilemma"" tells the story of a recovering gambler who, after discovering that his best friend's wife is having an affair, falls victim to his own guilty conscience and ultimately loses himself in strange, obsessive behaviors. Many directors would have used this idea as the basis for a psychological thriller, but in the hands of Ron Howard, it has become a comedy. This is puzzling because the basic scenario is anything but funny, and parts of the film shy away so thoroughly from humor it's as if Howard didn't trust his instincts on the matter. The result is a confused film, one that can't find the right balance between broad, slapstick comedy and serious subject matter, the latter of which is surprisingly dark and has been completely avoided in the ad campaigns.It does have an engaging premise, though, and there are specific scenes so well written and performed that I could see flashes of greatness. I also appreciated the underlying message of the film, namely that honesty is the best policy - provided you fess up at the time of an indiscretion instead of five, ten, or fifteen years later. No one needs to learn this lesson more than Ronny Valentine (Vince Vaughn). Although he has had gambling problems in the past, and although he relapsed two years ago, he seems to be on the right track; he's in a loving, committed relationship with his girlfriend, Beth (Jennifer Connelly), and he and his best friend and business partner, Nick (Kevin James), are on the verge of a major business deal that will put fuel efficient engines into muscle cars.One day, while arranging the details for finally proposing to Beth, he notices Nick's wife, Geneva (Winona Ryder), kissing another man. He now finds himself in a very awkward position. Does he tell his best friend that his wife is cheating on him, or does he stay out of it? When Ronny confronts Geneva, it very quickly becomes apparent that the situation isn't as clear cut as it might seem. Yes, she has been unfaithful, but she has also been neglected and incredibly lonely. Nick, while generally a decent man, deserves some of the blame - he often goes somewhere a married man really isn't supposed to go. And what about Beth? Is she being completely honest? Who is Ronny to judge what is and isn't moral? It's not as if he doesn't have a secret of his own, one he would prefer to keep hidden from both Beth and Nick. Is telling the truth worth the risk of ruining your life?There comes a point at which Ronny confronts the other man, a tattooed brute named Zip (Channing Tatum), in a scene I was conflicted about. It is, on the one hand, an effective departure from the goofiness that defined the earlier portions of the film. On the other hand, it shows Ronny revealing a very unpleasant side to his personality. In a more serious movie, we would already be sure that the man was deeply troubled and in need of serious help. We would, in all likelihood, not even feel the need to laugh, simply because what he's doing is not funny. But this movie wants us to laugh, so we automatically view his disturbing behavior through an entirely different lens. It's an awkward moment, one that could have been avoided had the filmmakers known what kind of movie they wanted to make.If I had had any input in the creation of this film, I would have strongly suggested veering away from comedy. The laughs this movie generates come not from genuinely funny situations but from a litany of crude gags that add absolutely nothing to the story. I was especially put off by the inclusion of Queen Latifah, whose character serves no purpose apart from providing us with the occasional orgasm joke. More points off for a contrived and unrewarding scene in which Ronny falls face-first into a poisonous bush, resulting in rashes, boils, and one instance of painful urination. Had none of this been included, there would have been a more sardonic edge to a scene where Ronny proposes a highly inappropriate toast at the anniversary party of Beth's parents. It should come as no surprise that the topic is honesty.I enjoyed most of the cast, especially Connelly, who makes Beth the most convincing character of the whole film. Credit also to Ryder, whose take on Geneva isn't as one-dimensional as it may seem. As for the lead males, they give relatively decent performances, although they rely a little too heavily on personas that grew old a long time ago; I'm growing weary of Vince Vaughn's laid-back, fast-talking persona, and there are times when it seems James is stuck in Doug Heffernan mode. ""The Dilemma"" has its good points, but it also wastes a lot of its potential, in large part because no one involved could decide on a tone. I'm hoping Ron Howard is a bit more decisive when making his next movie.",3,Honesty is the Best Policy,1294963200,"01 14, 2011",2011,4763,"['Dilemma', 'story', 'recovering', 'gambler', 'who', 'discovering', 'best', 'friend', 'wife', 'having', 'affair', 'victim', 'own', 'guilty', 'conscience', 'ultimately', 'strange', 'obsessive', 'behaviors', 'Many', 'directors', 'would', 'have', 'used', 'idea', 'basis', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'hands', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'become', 'comedy', 'puzzling', 'basic', 'scenario', 'anything', 'funny', 'parts', 'film', 'shy', 'away', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'humor', 'Howard', 'did', ""n't"", 'trust', 'instincts', 'matter', 'result', 'confused', 'film', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'right', 'balance', 'broad', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'serious', 'subject', 'matter', 'latter', 'surprisingly', 'dark', 'been', 'completely', 'avoided', 'ad', 'campaigns.It', 'have', 'engaging', 'premise', 'are', 'specific', 'scenes', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'performed', 'could', 'see', 'flashes', 'greatness', 'also', 'appreciated', 'underlying', 'message', 'film', 'namely', 'honesty', 'best', 'policy', 'provided', 'fess', 'up', 'time', 'indiscretion', 'instead', 'five', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'one', 'learn', 'lesson', 'more', 'Ronny', 'Valentine', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'had', 'gambling', 'problems', 'past', 'relapsed', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'be', 'right', 'track', 'loving', 'committed', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'Beth', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'best', 'friend', 'business', 'partner', 'Nick', 'Kevin', 'James', 'are', 'verge', 'major', 'business', 'deal', 'will', 'put', 'fuel', 'efficient', 'engines', 'muscle', 'cars.One', 'day', 'arranging', 'details', 'finally', 'proposing', 'Beth', 'Nick', 'wife', 'Geneva', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'kissing', 'man', 'now', 'very', 'awkward', 'position', 'tell', 'best', 'friend', 'wife', 'cheating', 'stay', 'When', 'Ronny', 'confronts', 'Geneva', 'very', 'quickly', 'becomes', 'apparent', 'situation', ""n't"", 'clear', 'cut', 'might', 'seem', 'Yes', 'been', 'unfaithful', 'also', 'been', 'neglected', 'incredibly', 'lonely', 'Nick', 'generally', 'decent', 'man', 'blame', 'often', 'somewhere', 'married', 'man', 'really', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'go', 'what', 'Beth', 'being', 'completely', 'honest', 'Who', 'Ronny', 'judge', 'what', ""n't"", 'moral', 'not', ""n't"", 'have', 'secret', 'own', 'one', 'would', 'prefer', 'keep', 'hidden', 'Beth', 'Nick', 'telling', 'truth', 'risk', 'ruining', 'life', 'point', 'Ronny', 'other', 'man', 'tattooed', 'brute', 'named', 'Zip', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'scene', 'was', 'conflicted', 'one', 'hand', 'effective', 'departure', 'goofiness', 'defined', 'earlier', 'portions', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'Ronny', 'revealing', 'very', 'unpleasant', 'side', 'personality', 'more', 'serious', 'movie', 'would', 'already', 'be', 'sure', 'man', 'was', 'deeply', 'troubled', 'need', 'serious', 'help', 'would', 'likelihood', 'not', 'even', 'feel', 'need', 'laugh', 'simply', 'what', 'doing', 'not', 'funny', 'movie', 'laugh', 'automatically', 'view', 'disturbing', 'behavior', 'entirely', 'different', 'lens', 'awkward', 'moment', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'had', 'filmmakers', 'known', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'wanted', 'make.If', 'had', 'had', 'input', 'creation', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'strongly', 'suggested', 'veering', 'away', 'comedy', 'laughs', 'movie', 'come', 'not', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'situations', 'litany', 'crude', 'gags', 'add', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'story', 'was', 'especially', 'put', 'off', 'inclusion', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'character', 'purpose', 'apart', 'providing', 'occasional', 'orgasm', 'joke', 'More', 'points', 'off', 'contrived', 'unrewarding', 'scene', 'Ronny', 'face-first', 'poisonous', 'bush', 'resulting', 'rashes', 'boils', 'one', 'instance', 'painful', 'urination', 'Had', 'none', 'been', 'included', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'sardonic', 'edge', 'scene', 'where', 'Ronny', 'highly', 'inappropriate', 'toast', 'anniversary', 'party', 'Beth', 'parents', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'topic', 'honesty.I', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'cast', 'especially', 'Connelly', 'who', 'Beth', 'most', 'convincing', 'character', 'whole', 'film', 'Credit', 'also', 'Ryder', 'take', 'Geneva', ""n't"", 'as', 'one-dimensional', 'may', 'seem', 'lead', 'males', 'give', 'relatively', 'decent', 'performances', 'rely', 'little', 'too', 'heavily', 'personas', 'grew', 'old', 'long', 'time', ""'m"", 'growing', 'weary', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'laid-back', 'fast-talking', 'persona', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'James', 'stuck', 'Doug', 'Heffernan', 'mode', 'Dilemma', 'good', 'points', 'also', 'lot', 'potential', 'large', 'part', 'one', 'involved', 'could', 'decide', 'tone', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'bit', 'more', 'decisive', 'when', 'making', 'next', 'movie']",The Dilemma

1371772,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B003Y5H4ZW,DanD,"[27, 33]","Let's face it: Finding your best friend's wife is cheating on him, and then trying to tell him (and then trying NOT to tell him), isn't funny.  A great comedic director could take that situation and turn it around, make the serious hysterical.  Ron Howard, alas, is not a great comedic directer.  He's a pretty darn good dramatic director, however, which ultimately hinders THE DILEMMA.The problem is, the film isn't funny.  Even when it tries, which it rarely does.  At moments, the film achieves a certain poignancy that is touching; it examines the crevices of the buddy-buddy relationship (in a much more serious way than, say Judd Apatow usually does), and hits some disturbingly harsh notes.  What is most frustrating is that the cast (yes, even Kevin James) is up for the challenge: Vince Vaughn has proven himself a dramatic actor in the past, as has Jennifer Connelly.  James holds his own; in fact, when he's at his worst when he's trying for yucks.  Winnona Ryder delivers a solid, understated performance (as she did in BLACK SWAN).  Queen Latifah is a bit over-the-top in her minor role, but Channing Tatum is surprisingly not; not that he's suddenly metamorphosed into a mesmerizing actor (his ""emotional"" scene opposite Vaughn makes the latter look like a true thespian), but at least he's trying here.Allan Loeb's script is a bit two-dimensional, and Ron Howard's directing, as it unfortunately can be, is lazy; this film meanders, and never truly finds its place.  It's not funny--I saw it in a packed (I know!) theater, and there were mostly groans--and it's not tender; it's uncomfortable to watch, but usually in the wrong ways.  Occasionally the film strikes just the right awkward note, giving you a peak at the film it COULD have been.  But then, who would want to go see a drama starring Vince Vaughn and Kevin James?

We, again, take a great idea and stretch it to its maximum instead of dealing right away with the main idea. One of the main character (A) saw a secondary character do something wrong. He then wanders if he must tell it or not to the other main character (B) who is going to be deeply affected by the revelation. The rest of the movie will simply be built on that revelation to come and everything that gets, of course, in the way. Finally, at the end, when it gets interesting, the movie is over. The point is: Why not reveal what has to be revealed as soon as the occasion presents itself and then go on an original new plot? For me, the real juice isn't son much in the revelation itself but more in the effect it is going to have. By stretching the narrative the way they do, we simply get ourselves in stupid situations:1- Character A can never reveal anything cause Character B always cuts him off.2- Character A simply shuts up instead of saying it anyway.3- Character B is then angry that Character A never said anything (Hello!?!).4- Character A doesn't say anything to anybody else, not even his soon-to-be-wife, and gets himself in a mess. And you find him stupid for it. Why wouldn't you want to say anything? Especially now that everybody thinks you're hiding something? You just going to let your life fall in the drain without saying anything? When it's not even your fault?That is what happens when you stretch the plot instead of dealing with it. The story and characters become stupid. Cause you need to stretch and there is NO LOGIC behind the stretching. No reasons other than to stretch the plot.Another great idea down the drain.P.S.: The fact that it is built as a comedy and that it is not funny does not help either. Also, the two male characters aren't that charismatic either. Casting problem. I kept wandering why such beautiful ladies (Ryder and Connelly) fell so desperately in love with them. And why wouldn't Ryder's husband, who's lucky enough to have such a babe, want to sleep with her anymore? Does he think he can get a better looking lady?

""The Dilemma"" was one of those flicks for me. I heard so much bad stuff about it, that where I would typically want to watch it just to see how wrong everybody was, I actually didn't want to see it at all.Quite frequently, problems occur at my local Blockbuster, where titles that are supposed to be on the shelf on a given day, aren't. So when this movie finally made it to the shelf 1 1/2 weeks after its release date (their excuse was that Direct TV bought out Blockbuster, and they were closing negotiation contracts with movie studios), it was the only fairly new release there on that particular day that I hadn't seen. So, I reluctantly picked it up.First off, this was improperly billed as a comedy. WRONG! It's not even a dark comedy. I laughed all of three times, and only once out loud. It's all about soul searching and trying to decide how to do what is right in an almost impossibly awkward situation. It's about questioning whether or not to follow your heart or your head. It's about seeing honesty for what it truly is. It's about relationships and the ability to maintain fidelity within one where the entire physical part of it has been removed. It's about much, much more, as well.Now I can see why everyone bashed ""The Dilemma"" from here to Kingdom Come. It was billed as a comedy, and the movie viewers came out of the theater confused as to why they barely laughed, let alone why they hardly cracked a smile. The human psyche is a computer that is programmable. If you program that computer to think that it is going to see an comedy and nothing is funny, the computer goes haywire. Somewhere inside it's intricate information pathways is the repetitive phrase, ""That does not compute! That does not compute! That does not compute!"" The end result is confusion, which breeds a dislike of what caused the confusion. It wasn't the movie, folks. It was the idiots who tried to pass it off as a comedy, when it was clearly a drama with a couple of small funny bits for comic relief.So, I'm here to tell you this: If you watch this movie with your brain already programmed to see a drama, you'll love it.

It is about a guy who sees his best friends wife hugging and kissing a guy.  Then, he tries to tell the friend, but the friend is busy because him and the guy who saw the wife are trying to close a deal between their company and another.  So, he tells the wife and she gets emotional and tells him things his friend does.  He catches the guy whose wife is cheating in a lie, then he doesn't know what to do.  The movie really made me laugh.  Vince Vaughn has a way of talking that just makes you feel comfortable.  He just sounds funny.  The way he says things and expresses his words.  Kevin James didn't get as much time onscreen as Vaughn.  Which is a shame because he is very funny as well.Through the movie Vaughn's character tries to figure out what to do, who to believe and how to go about telling his friend what he saw.  As I said, we did laugh a lot when watching the movie.  It has some cool special features and is one of those movies that will be good to watch more than once.  Now, some of the things that bothered me about the movie are this.  Through the entire movie, I kept waiting for something.  I'm not even sure what it was, but I never got it.  Maybe I wanted Vaughn's character to have more sneaky scenes then he had, or perhaps I wanted more confrontation between Vaughn's characters and his friends wife.  Another thing that bothered me is this, when James's character finds out what is going on, he gets really made at Vaughn's character and never says anything really to his wife.  Also, the wife the whole time is almost sad the husband is upset.  I mean really?  Your husband finds out you cheated and your surprised he is upset.  But, it didn't seem he was mad at her.  A very strange ending to the movie.  Though, not the very end.As I said, the movie was funny.  It made my family and I laugh.  It is the classic Vince Vaughn type of humor.  Kind of dry but witty while giving you the feeling that his character wants good to happen, though he is only making this worse while trying.  If your not sure you will like it, (and really how can you be) rent it first.

1371792,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B003Y5H4ZW,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 6]","The Dilemma is the latest film by director Ron Howard and seems like an odd choice for him, considering two films ago he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director. The Dilemma was marketed as a typical, straight-forward romantic-comedy like the kind we see released every month. In fact, the following month saw the release of Just Go with It, which was also written by Alan Loeb. While this movie does differ from the typical romantic-comedy template and has elements of drama and very dark humor, Loeb's script doesn't quite know how to handle these elements and that's probably the reason it's been ravaged by audiences and critics alike. Whether or not you'll enjoy this film has a lot to do with how you personally respond to it.Ronny (Vince Vaughn) and Nick (Kevin James) have been best friends since college and are now partners in an auto design firm. Ronny is a recovering gambler who is dating the beautiful Beth (Jennifer Connelly), while Nick is happily married to Geneva (Winona Ryder). Ronny and Nick have just secured a deal with Dodge that could bring them a lot of money and both Nick and Geneva encourage Ronny to finally pop the question to Beth. While planning his proposal, Ronny visits a botanical garden and spots Geneva kissing another man named Zip (Channing Tatum). Ronny intends to tell Nick immediately, but finds him under intense stress and pressure and can't bring himself to do it. Ronny confronts Geneva, who claims her affair is over and that she has felt neglected with Nick struggling to meet various deadlines. She reluctantly agrees to tell Nick once the two have finished their Chrysler deal. It's only when Ronny realizes that not all is as it seems that his dilemma continues. The movie co-stars Queen Latifah and Ron Howard's brother Clint Howard makes an appearance as the director of the botanical garden.Much has been made about the couples in the film and how it's another example of doughy men dating gorgeous women. Are the couples mismatched? Perhaps by traditional standards, yes, but this is Hollywood, where Julia Roberts married Lyle Lovett and Lisa-Marie Presley married Michael Jackson. With this in mind, I can buy Winona Ryder and Kevin James as a couple. In addition, Connelly may be gorgeous and Vaughn may be Vaughn but they actually make a believable couple as well. Some have also complained that Ronny doesn't have much of a dilemma, which I think is true initially until Geneva reveals herself as a despicable person and gives him one.A comedy can't succeed very well if the script isn't funny and the movie relies on its actors to provide it with humor. The comedy straddles a fine line between dark and light, even taking a turn into drama at times. Loeb's script does not do a great job of balancing the darker material with the comedic elements, but they're not completely off-balance and some of the dramatic elements are just as effective as the comedic ones. The script is truly the movie's biggest flaw. There are some subtle lines that are amusing enough if you notice them, but very little of the humor presented in the film stems from the script and is funny only as a result of the actor's delivery and how you respond to that delivery. If you find Vaughn's deadpan rambling funny, there are several scenes you will likely enjoy here. His controversial ""electric car"" speech is not particularly well written, but Vaughn's deadpan makes the scene work. Despite how dark in nature the film has become at this point, I was amused by parts of Ronny's fight with Zip. Here is a line James says in the film that I found funny; ""Most of the time you end up at the ice cream parlor with a big, hot fudge sundae...Nuts."" This is not funny on paper; James deadpan delivery makes it so. At least, that's how I responded to it. If you don't find Vince Vaughn and Kevin James funny, you will not like this film. Loeb makes one more poor decision, this time involving characterization. As the movie grows darker, Ronny grows more paranoid and Loeb takes this a little too far. While Ronny's anniversary speech is awkward and uncomfortably amusing, it betrays his character as it's been established that Ronny makes his money as a smooth talker. With all that said, I found the script compelling enough to stay afloat, I empathized with these characters, and I was interested to see how the story was going to pan out.The dynamic between Vaughn and James is convincing and the two have chemistry together, making the film's message about friendship easier to swallow. Ryder looks stunning and has some scenes that show her as an actress on the verge of a comeback. Her performance is so good at times; she seems to be giving it in a different movie. Connelly is mostly underutilized here, as the bulk of the story centers on Ronny, Nick, and Geneva but she's good in her scenes with Vaughn. Queen Latifah, a capable comedienne and actress, basically shows up to make sexual innuendoes. Her character is unnecessary and her playing this character seems like a waste of talent, which isn't to say she won't make you smile. Finally, I'm not a fan of Channing Tatum and I don't like his character Zip, but I must admit that his performance isn't half-bad. It's not a role that requires much from an actor, but for a heavily-criticized actor he's quite good.The Dilemma is not without flaws, but I think that people may just expect more from Ron Howard. Most films in this genre aren't particularly good and at least The Dilemma tries to differentiate from the formula a bit. If this had been directed by another, less acclaimed director I don't believe it would have been so panned. It's far from great, but one must look at it a little deeper. For a movie in this genre it doesn't have a by-the-numbers plot, it has characters with more complicated personalities than usual, and it has darker subject matter than usual...Since when is that a bad thing?GRADE: B-",4,"Heavily Flawed, But Enjoyable Rom-Com That Tries to Be Different",1302480000,"04 11, 2011",2011,5931,"['Dilemma', 'latest', 'film', 'director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'odd',

1371793,AEL6AD2AL2UX8,B003Y5H4ZW,"Kevin ""Revolution""","[1, 2]","This is a drama not a comedy which is the problem with this movie.  It's a problem because it was marketed to the wrong audience.  It's surprisingly quite good if you're not seeing it thinking its a comedy.  Yeah, there are some funny elements, mostly all coming from Queen Latifah if you can believe it, not Vince Vaughan who is tragic - in a good way.  The movie deals with very serious relationship issues as well as discovering your best friends wife is cheating on him.  It's about friendship and relationships.The real surprises came from the supporting characters, Winona Ryder and Channing Tatum.  They both separately showed depth of emotion.  Yeah you wouldn't think pretty boy Channing Tatum could produce something like that, but I was thrown off too.  Winona displayed some deeper acting chops and I remembered why she went to the top of the map in the 80's and 90's.  She's a great actress.

1371797,A18HHKM6WGEF9D,B003Y5H4ZW,"L. Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[6, 10]","I was truly shocked to come on here and see so many negative reviews. I rarely rate films 5-stars, and my tastes usually don't differ that much from the general audience, but I really thought this film was great. So now I will try to explain why, so that those out there that might have similar tastes can find it.I think first and foremost I liked this film because it manages to have both true comedic and true dramatic moments. It also walks a fine line at times, just pulling back from horrifying in the case of some characters (Winona Ryder especially.) As has already been covered in several other reviews, the material is complicated. Vince Vaughn discovers that his best friend's (Kevin James) wife (Winona Ryder) is cheating on him, and is not sure whether or when or how to tell him, as they are in the middle of a big make-or-break project for their fledgling company. Meanwhile, Vaughn is trying to gear himself up to propose to his own girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly.)I found the writing excellent and unusual, in that it was able to successfully swing from slap-stick to heavy drama. James' and Vaughn's relationship is nuanced and mature - so much better than the other guy friendships in movies that seem to be about nothing more than drinking and gross-out jokes. But where the movie really probes is marriage, and trust, and what it takes for a marriage to work, and what is the point at which it doesn't work anymore. The movie begins with the 2 couples discussing the question 'when do you really know someone, or can you ever?' and that is really the heart of the film. In an age when we are continually confronted in the media with examples of so-called model citizens that have betrayed their loved ones, as well as the public trust, these are intriguing questions.I think that ultimately the material is smart and sophisticated, and maybe that threw a lot of people off - with Vaughn and James in the cast, maybe they were expecting another Mall Cop or Couples Retreat. This is a totally different movie. The comedy ranges from slapstick to black, with plenty of heartfelt drama in between, and to me somehow it all worked. I feel like the negative reviews are mostly judging the movie against what they thought it was going to be - a semi-mindless comedy - rather than judging the film on its own merits.I thought every performance was excellent as well. It's so great to see Winona Ryder back on the screen more, and she is excellent in this. In one scene Vince Vaughn confronts her in a restaurant about her betrayal, and threatens to tell Kevin James. She responds by showing him exactly what she will say to James in response - a borderline horrifying act in which she pretends to tell him that Vaughn has been hitting on her for years. It cuts straight to the heart of the duplicity that this film explores. And yet, she is truly devastated that her marriage is threatened, and manages to relay that as well.So that's my take! An excellent, nuanced, complex film. Give it a shot, and keep an open mind.",5,I am Shocked More People Don't Appreciate This Film,1308355200,"06 18, 2011",2011,3031,"['was', 'truly', 'shocked', 'come', 'here', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'rarely', 'rate', 'films', '5-stars', 'tastes', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'differ', 'that', 'much', 'general', 'audience', 'really', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'So', 'now', 'will', 'try', 'explain', 'why', 'there', 'might', 'have', 'similar', 'tastes', 'can', 'find', 'it.I', 'think', 'first', 'foremost', 'liked', 'film', 'have', 'true', 'comedic', 'true', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'also', 'fine', 'line', 'times', 'just', 'pulling', 'back', 'horrifying', 'case', 'characters', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'especially', 'already', 'been', 'covered', 'several', 'other', 'reviews', 'material', 'complicated', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'best', 'friend', 'Kevin', 'James', 'wife', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'cheating', 'not', 'sure', 'when', 'how', 'tell', 'are', 'middle', 'big', 'make-or-break', 'project', 'fledgling', 'company', 'Meanwhile', 'Vaughn', 'trying', 'gear', 'propose', 'own', 'girlfriend', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'found', 'writing', 'excellent', 'unusual', 'was', 'able', 'successfully', 'swing', 'slap-stick', 'heavy', 'drama', 'James', 'Vaughn', 'relationship', 'nuanced', 'mature', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'other', 'guy', 'friendships', 'movies', 'seem', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'drinking', 'gross-out', 'jokes', 'where', 'movie', 'really', 'marriage', 'trust', 'what', 'marriage', 'work', 'what', 'point', ""n't"", 'work', 'anymore', 'movie', '2', 'couples', 'discussing', 'question', 'do', 'really', 'know', 'someone', 'can', 'ever', 'really', 'heart', 'film', 'age', 'when', 'are', 'continually', 'confronted', 'media', 'examples', 'so-called', 'model', 'citizens', 'have', 'betrayed', 'loved', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'public', 'trust', 'are', 'intriguing', 'questions.I', 'think', 'ultimately', 'material', 'smart', 'sophisticated', 'maybe', 'threw', 'lot', 'people', 'Vaughn', 'James', 'cast', 'maybe', 'were', 'expecting', 'Mall', 'Cop', 'Couples', 'Retreat', 'totally', 'different', 'movie', 'comedy', 'slapstick', 'black', 'plenty', 'heartfelt', 'drama', 'somehow', 'worked', 'feel', 'negative', 'reviews', 'are', 'mostly', 'judging', 'movie', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'semi-mindless', 'comedy', 'rather', 'judging', 'film', 'own', 'merits.I', 'thought', 'performance', 'was', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'so', 'great', 'see', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'back', 'screen', 'more', 'excellent', 'one', 'scene', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'restaurant', 'betrayal', 'tell', 'Kevin', 'James', 'showing', 'exactly', 'what', 'will', 'say', 'James', 'response', 'borderline', 'horrifying', 'act', 'tell', 'Vaughn', 'been', 'hitting', 'years', 'straight', 'heart', 'duplicity', 'film', 'yet', 'truly', 'devastated', 'marriage', 'threatened', 'relay', 'as', 'take', 'excellent', 'nuanced', 'complex', 'film', 'Give', 'shot', 'keep', 'open', 'mind']",The Dilemma

The movie involves Ronny (Mr. Vaughn) seeing his best friend Nick's (Mr. James) wife Geneva (Wynona Ryder) kissing another man (Channing Tatum) and struggling to try and tell Nick about it.  Along the way, it becomes Ronny, who is a former gambling addict, who starts to come under suspicion for slipping back into his old habits by Nick & his girlfriend Beth (Jennifer Connelly).  Ronny & Nick have pitched a deal to Dodge to have them finance their work on an electric engine that has the sound and feel of old muscle cars.  While there they are set up with Susan (Queen Latifah) who is an overzealous supervisor who talks of having lady wood at their idea.  The film starts off as a straight comedy, but lapses into more a dark side with dramatic overtones.  Mr. Vaughn doesn't veer off too far from his usual screen persona.  Mr. Vaughn is a fast talking funny guy and who struggles with growing up, but comes to an adult decision in the end.  Mr. James plays somewhat against type as a tightly wound worrier who doubts his gift at building car engines.  The movie has a few funny moments including an especially funny scene where Ronny is giving a toast at Beth's parent's 40th anniversary party regarding second cousins, but overall a film with this much talent that includes two Oscar winners (Ms. Connelly and director Ron Howard) should be much more than this uneven affair.",2,Fails To Deliver,1306972800,"06 2, 2011",2011,1495,"['Dilemma', 'semi-comedic', 'movie', 'starring', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Kevin', 'James', 'business', 'partners', 'best', 'friends', 'movie', 'Ronny', 'Mr.', 'Vaughn', 'seeing', 'best', 'friend', 'Nick', 'Mr.', 'James', 'wife', 'Geneva', 'Wynona', 'Ryder', 'kissing', 'man', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'struggling', 'try', 'tell', 'Nick', 'way', 'Ronny', 'who', 'former', 'gambling', 'addict', 'who', 'come', 'suspicion', 'slipping', 'back', 'old', 'habits', 'Nick', 'girlfriend', 'Beth', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Ronny', 'Nick', 'have', 'pitched', 'deal', 'Dodge', 'have', 'finance', 'work', 'electric', 'engine', 'sound', 'feel', 'old', 'muscle', 'cars', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'Susan', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'who', 'overzealous', 'supervisor', 'who', 'having', 'lady', 'wood', 'idea', 'film', 'off', 'straight', 'comedy', 'more', 'dark', 'side', 'dramatic', 'overtones', 'Mr.', 'Vaughn', ""n't"", 'veer', 'off', 'too', 'far', 'usual', 'screen', 'persona', 'Mr.', 'Vaughn', 'fast', 'talking', 'funny', 'guy', 'who', 'growing', 'up', 'adult', 'decision', 'end', 'Mr.', 'James', 'somewhat', 'type', 'tightly', 'wound', 'worrier', 'who', 'gift', 'building', 'car', 'engines', 'movie', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'including', 'especially', 'funny', 'scene', 'where', 'Ronny', 'giving', 'toast', 'Beth', 'parent', '40th', 'anniversary', 'party', 'regarding', 'second', 'cousins', 'film', 'much', 'talent', 'two', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'Ms.', 'Connelly', 'director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'should', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'uneven', 'affair']",The Dilemma

But my likes of this BD have everything to do with how much it showcases Chicago in HD, both in film and in supplements.The story follows exactly as it shows in the trailer, with the only legitimately funny scenes being shown there; two best friends pushing their product to a big US automaker, all whilst navigating relationships with their ladies and themselves. The backdrop of Chicago is what adds another character to this awkward dramedy (arguments can abound about how this is a comedy - but both times I screened this the comedy times in at less than 12 minutes of the 112-minute running).The picture is outstanding with the aerial sequences of Chicago showcasing brilliantly. The DTS is on par for a non-action Universal film. The supplements are a mixed bag though and include:* Deleted scenes and alternate ending, 44:39 minutes. Wow - this movie already felt long, and with Ron Howard's intro to these scenes he admits that this movie was even way longer. He felt the film was interesting to look at but these scenes definitely showcase the problems they had in trying to figure out which way this film was trying to go - comedy or drama. The alternate ending was more somber, and once you see that and some of the other cuts you can see the flubs they were having to remove/dub in the film (volumes of crew visible in reflections, dubbing in dialogue to facilitate the happier ending, and so on).* Gag reel, 4:30 minutes. Relatively unfunny with one exception of a Vince Vaughn imrpov off camera at the end.* This is the Dilemma making of, 13:45 minutes. A clip heavy talking head piece that had only one highlight of acknowledging Chicago as a character in this film. Forgettable.* Tour of Chicago, descriptions of four locations filmed at in Chicago, 12:15 minutes in total. The BD does not give you the option of a play-all so you have to navigate through each selection.---Green Mill: The owner gives a slightly cheesy history of the mob related past at his establishment, including tunnels, a trap door and stories.---United Center: An ad promo for the center, skipper; do the other United one instead.---The Loft: 4 minutes of production design on the main room they used, skipper.---Garfield Conservatory: 2 minutes that had too much about the actors and not enough about the place itself, beautiful location but did not show very much of it.* On Ice, 4:48 minutes. Worthy piece about the hockey stadium and all things Blackhawks. Also shows how some of their stars helped with Ron Howard's prep.*BD Live, nothing notably new.*pocketBlu app.*Dig Copy, online only - no disc to activate.*My Movies, streaming. Can stream several Universal titles for 2.99 each, BD dependent.English, Spanish, French and (2.0) DVS tracks with subs in same. Not a fan of how they made the entire film have these slo-mo sequences and drawn out bromance scenes that dragged the film on for a good twenty minutes longer than it should have been (but seeing that Ron wanted this to be a 2.5 hour film I guess I should be happier). Expect a light dramedy instead of a ""HILARIOUS"" (cover art) comedy and I think you might get more out of it. Queen Latifah's beginning to end innuendo adds the most schtick humor, and Jennifer Connelly added a nice feel to the film to give it a better overall theme. 2 stars for the film and 1.5 stars for the BD specs and supplements.

The 'comedy' in this Ron Howard picture is not something to be laughed at, it's something to help show the ineptitude of the characters we are watching. Vince Vaughn's Ronny is not the brightest of guys and the stupid things he says and the situation's he gets himself into are supposed to be visual representations of his struggle at determining societal rules and standards of conduct. This comes into play with the exploration of 'cheating' and 'dishonesty' in relationships. These themes are handled rather lightly but in a way I found to be accessible to just about anyone. Who hasn't questioned the commitment and character of those closest to them? This is a universal issue, that's why I am surprised that ""The Dilemma"" was received so poorly by critics and audiences a like. I admire that Howard took a more serious approach to this material instead of going for the slapstick comedy route. The cast is very good here, Vaughn, Kevin James (in a surprisingly honest performance), Winona Ryder and the always reliable Jennifer Connelly prove relatable and honest when they are needed to be. What ultimately sold ""The Dilemma"" for me was Ron Howard's classy approach at a serious subject. He handles the narrative with respect and just enough depth to make things satisfying.

1371825,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B003Y5H4ZW,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[11, 19]","""The Dilemma"", or as my mother referred to it after watching the trailer ""the film with those two doughy guys who are married to younger, prettier women"" is a deplorably unfunny ""comedy"". I didn't expect much, maybe a few laughs, but this new film from Ron Howard (Ron Howard? the director of ""Parenthood"", ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""Apollo 13""? THAT Ron Howard?) delivers even less. FAR less.Ronny (Vince Vaughn) and Nick (Kevin James) are two best buddies who also work together in their own struggling Chicago-based car engine design company. After a meeting at Chrysler, to show off their new electric muscle car engine, they begin to feel a little good about things, maybe all of their hard work is finally about to pay off. They could earn a big contract making all of the years of struggle worth it. Sounds like the perfect time for Ronny to propose to his longtime girlfriend Beth (Jennifer Connelly), a rising chef. But Ronny oversees Geneva (Winona Ryder), Nick's wife making out with Zip (Channing Tatum). Ronny threatens to expose her, but she has other ideas.Sounds like a funny movie doesn't it? Yeah, no.I knew it would be bad. ""The Dilemma"" was 'delayed' and Universal Studios 'failed to screen the film in time for reviews'. But there are two indications of how low the standards for this film truly are. The two gentlemen attend the Chicago auto show. To set the stage, Howard lingers his camera not on the woman who are posing next to the cars in silky dresses, he lingers the camera on their torsos and buts. It seems very old fashioned to even have pretty women draping themselves over cars at these shows and in commercials. Somehow, Howard makes the practice even dirtier and more reprehensible. The moment Queen Latifah's character, Susan Warner, a consultant for Chrysler, starts talking, repeatedly, about her 'lady wood', you realize how low the standards of this film are.Howard's brother Clint pops up for a few moments, as the manager of an arboretum. He and Latifah are the only people in the entire film who seem to get they are in a comedy. Unfortunately, Clint's role is very brief.As soon as Ronny spots Geneva cheating on his best friend, the entire film becomes two things. Both of them bad. Ronny confronts Geneva. She becomes scared and promises to tell Nick about her affair, Then Ronny learns she is still seeing Zip. She confronts Ronny. Ronny begins to suspect Beth of something. Beth begins to suspect Ronny of something. Everyone becomes extremely unpleasant. All of the characters become suspicious of one another. These actions help to establish a tone of negativity which permeates the entire film, making it unpleasant to watch.When you go to a comedy, you want to laugh. At the very least, you hope to be amused. To make a mean-spirited film funny, you have to have the right tongue-in-cheek delivery. ""A Fish Called Wanda"" is a great example. Michael Palin's character, a pet-lover, accidentally kills an elderly woman's dogs. He is so distraught; the action becomes more shocking, eliciting more laughter. We also learn with him the old woman is not very likable which makes the death of the dogs a little funnier. When Kevin Kline's Otto teases Palin's character mercilessly about his stutter, it should be cringe inducing. But because we know Otto is into some kinky stuff, and is truly sadistic, the actions become funnier because we are laughing at him, not with him. In ""The Dilemma', the characters are too straight to help make the mean-spirited nature of their characters seem anything but mean. There is no complexity to the characters and it almost seems like we should be watching them on some bad reality show. Free, on television. Paying to watch them be mean is insulting.Vince Vaughn is one of a handful of actors who first made their mark in films most noted for their use of original, well-written dialogue. And he helped write that film, so the early success seems to have validated this technique in Vaughn's eyes. Since then, most of his characters are very similar, they usually live in Chicago, are usually big sports fans and usually riff endlessly on whatever the character seems to have on his mind. This was interesting, and fun at first. But now, in its umpteenth reiteration, the technique is getting old. In ""The Dilemma"", Ronny is always talking, riffing about this and that as he tries to get to the subject. Everytime he speaks, he begins with something tangentially related, offering a little joke about it. Then he comes at it for another direction. Then a third. A fourth. He just talks all the time. It quickly resembles a bad stand-up routine delivered by a comic with no skill trying out his new material. Vaughn almost seems to be ad-libbing. But if that were the case, the dialogue would seem fresher, more interesting.Nick (James) is stressed out, feeling the pressure of all of their joint loans and the pressure of trying to develop this new engine. This is the stuff of comedy gold and about as funny as you might expect. Yeah. No.Connelly's character is almost inconsequential. Ronny's longtime partner, they seem very much in love and enjoy each other's company. There is some talk about Ronny finally proposing to Beth, but this story is clearly unimportant to the filmmakers and every time we return to it, it only seems tacked on and slows down the story unnecessarily.Winona Ryder has been appearing in more films, apparently paving the way for her comeback. Her choices are, at most, interesting. She was in ""Black Swan"" and her performance as the aging ballerina pushed to the sidelines is the most excessive and does the most scenery chewing. That's saying a lot for a film like ""Black Swan"". In ""The Dilemma"", she plays a woman who cheats on her lovable, doughy, funny husband. Actually, only one of these adjectives provides a correct description of Nick. He is doughy. He's too stressed out to be very funny or very likable. She cheats on her doughy husband with Channing Tatum. Hell. Who wouldn't?Queen Latifah makes a few appearances. The filmmakers don't know what to do with her because on (at least) two separate occasions, she starts talking about her ""lady wood"". I'm sure the filmmakers titter whenever someone says ""penis"" as well.""The Dilemma"" is a horrible excuse of a comedy. It is a big, big disappointment from Ron Howard.

I'm not sure if you find the set-up of Ron Howard-directed comedy ""The Dilemma"" as interesting as the filmmakers, but anyway, they thought the question has potential for funny, even insightful, comedy / drama, which unfortunately ""The Dilemma"" is not.Vince Vaughn plays a bachelor Ronny, living with a nice and beautiful girlfriend and successful chef Beth (Jennifer Connelly). Kevin James is Nick, a happily married genius car designer and best friend of Ronny. One day, in a Chicago botanical garden Ronny sees Geneva (Winona Ryder), Nick's wife, passionately kissing a young man Zip (Channing Tatum). With their presentation for Chrysler coming up soon, Ronny has to deal with the difficult (so he thinks) situations when his best friend Nick is under pressure struggling to design a new engine.If you are expecting something like a light-hearted comedy, ""The Dilemma"" is not. Actually, it is often dark, without much wit or sense of humor (except Vince Vaughn's deadpan delivery of them, which is worth seeing). You really don't like those self-absorbed (if not selfish) characters. Except a couple of scenes, the two female characters have little to do. Only Queen Latifah knows what she is doing, even though her character has virtually no place here.The biggest problem with ""The Dilemma"" is, well, Ronny's ""dilemma"" is not a big dilemma enough after all to make a comedy or a psychodrama. Once you decide on telling (or not telling) your best friend the truth, there is not much you can do. Ronny, it seems, thinks otherwise, which is fine, but instead of taking a simple course, he keeps making incredibly stupid decisions.

No. There were a couple moments where I laughed out loud but the rest of the movie seemed more like a drama. 2 best friends in business together, one happily married and the other in a serious relationship but won't take the plunge. One friend witnesses the other friend's wife cheating and the rest of the movie is primarily based around whether to tell or not to tell. The story was a good one, acting was great with a talented lineup of actors, and I enjoyed the movie.
