936245,AR37967IAR6ZT,B000B5XP24,Benjamin,"[0, 0]","This is a sports movie, maybe one of the best sports movies I've ever seen in my life because it manages to tell a completely original story while following the conventions of the typical ""Will our team win the championship?"" drama. Because it is a documentary about violent, full-contact indoor rugby between paralyzed men in armored wheelchairs, of course, MURDERBALL had trouble finding much of an audience this summer, despite good reviews, and that is a real shame. While building excitement as the United States team goes up against its bitter Canadian rival for the Paralympics gold medal in Athens, the film also shows us the stories of several team members, telling how they came to be paralyzed and how they deal with their paralysis day-to-day. The stories aren't always sympathetic, and the whole film isn't designed to tug at your heartstrings. Instead, you get frank, occasionally hilarious stories from the guys about sex, women, alcohol, bar fights, tattoos and a love for the sport. Beyond that, the film also addresses how a man with no hands can hold a slice of pizza. The film even has great characters, giving us heroes like USA team captain Mark Zupan and a villain named Joe Soares, a former member of the USA team who now coaches the evil Canadians and ignores his own awkward, adolescent son. Given the oddness of the film's topic, a lot of people may be reluctant to try this movie, but this documentary was the most brazenly fun film I saw all year.",5,One of the year's best.,1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,1476,"['sports', 'movie', 'maybe', 'one', 'best', 'sports', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'tell', 'completely', 'original', 'story', 'following', 'conventions', 'typical', 'Will', 'team', 'win', 'championship', 'drama', 'documentary', 'violent', 'full-contact', 'indoor', 'rugby', 'paralyzed', 'men', 'armored', 'wheelchairs', 'course', 'MURDERBALL', 'had', 'trouble', 'finding', 'much', 'audience', 'summer', 'good', 'reviews', 'real', 'shame', 'building', 'excitement', 'United', 'States', 'team', 'up', 'bitter', 'Canadian', 'rival', 'Paralympics', 'gold', 'medal', 'Athens', 'film', 'also', 'stories', 'several', 'team', 'members', 'telling', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'paralyzed', 'how', 'deal', 'paralysis', 'day-to-day', 'stories', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'sympathetic', 'whole', 'film', ""n't"", 'designed', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'Instead', 'get', 'frank', 'occasionally', 'hilarious', 'stories', 'guys', 'sex', 'women', 'alcohol', 'bar', 'fights', 'tattoos', 'love', 'sport', 'Beyond', 'film', 'also', 'how', 'man', 'hands', 'can', 'hold', 'slice', 'pizza', 'film', 'even', 'great', 'characters', 'giving', 'heroes', 'USA', 'team', 'captain', 'Mark', 'Zupan', 'villain', 'named', 'Joe', 'Soares', 'former', 'member', 'USA', 'team', 'who', 'now', 'evil', 'Canadians', 'own', 'awkward', 'adolescent', 'son', 'Given', 'oddness', 'film', 'topic', 'lot', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'reluctant', 'try', 'movie', 'documentary', 'was', 'most', 'brazenly', 'fun', 'film', 'saw', 'year']",Murderball

936247,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000B5XP24,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 3]","MURDERBALL, simply put, is a bunch of quadriplegics in wheelchairs playing full-contact Rugby on a sort of basketball court. But the movie is much more than that simplistic notion.MURDERBALL the movie is a voyage of discovery, telling its characters (the men in these wheelchairs) that life isn't over after a debilitating accident. And telling us, those who are fortunate enough not to be stuck in these chairs, that they've earned our respect, not our sympathies.This amazingly little known Paralympic sport is taken very seriously by the U.S. team, who've taken home the gold the past 11 times. Their specialized chairs are turned into battering rams for plowing into their fellow players (the speed at which they can travel are impressive and the impacts at the end ear-throttling).Mark Zupan is one of this documentary's focuses, a quadriplegic with serious attitude, huge biceps, a scowling face, dark tattoos, and, underneath it all, a heart of gold. Having been paralyzed after an accident caused by his best friend from high school, Christopher Igoe, the two have not spoken in years ...out of guilt, fear, and anger. But as the film winds down we see a softening in attitude on Mark Zupan's part and the two come together in an offish but very touching way.The other main focus of the documentary is on Joe Soares, a bitter man who lost his position on team America and now spins his Rugby wheels for the Canadian team ...as their coach. Sparks fly as the two teams meet up for the first time since Joe Soares took over the Canadian team. Joe is also so caught up in what he's doing that he forgets to remember the most important things in his life: his wife and son. At first, I absolutely hated Joe. But as the film rolled on, and some changes in Joe's life were forced upon him, I began to understand his position. The viewer also gets to see Joe grow out of his self-centeredness and into a more loving father and husband.The final focus is on a young man named Kevin, who is newly acquainted with a wheelchair after becoming a quadriplegic from a motorcycle accident. He's bitter, angry, depressed, all the things you'd expect after suffering such a horrific life-change. But Mark Zupan introduces him to wheelchair Rugby (Murderball) and Kevin is instantly hooked. Life takes on new meaning for Kevin and he obviously decides that his existence still has value. A great set of scenes!I'll end this review by mentioning the special features that came with the DVD. Johnnie Knoxville and ""Steve-O"" from Jackass the TV series, party with several of the members of the U.S. Paralympic Wheelchair Rugby team and it's a great thing to behold. Not only does it show how amiable these wheelchair-bound guys are, but it also shows us how their chairs don't hold them back in the slightest (punching each other, using cattle prods, and jumping off ramps in their chairs and into swimming pools).",5,Paralympics Take On Hollywood ...And Score!,1141948800,"03 10, 2006",2006,2901,"['MURDERBALL', 'simply', 'put', 'bunch', 'quadriplegics', 'wheelchairs', 'playing', 'full-contact', 'Rugby', 'sort', 'basketball', 'court', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'simplistic', 'movie', 'voyage', 'discovery', 'telling', 'characters', 'men', 'wheelchairs', 'life', ""n't"", 'over', 'debilitating', 'accident', 'telling', 'who', 'are', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'not', 'be', 'stuck', 'chairs', ""'ve"", 'earned', 'respect', 'not', 'sympathies.This', 'amazingly', 'little', 'known', 'Paralympic', 'sport', 'taken', 'very', 'seriously', 'U.S.', 'team', 'who', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'home', 'gold', 'past', '11', 'times', 'specialized', 'chairs', 'are', 'turned', 'battering', 'rams', 'plowing', 'fellow', 'players', 'speed', 'can', 'travel', 'are', 'impressive', 'impacts', 'end', 'ear-throttling', '.Mark', 'Zupan', 'one', 'documentary', 'focuses', 'quadriplegic', 'serious', 'attitude', 'huge', 'biceps', 'scowling', 'face', 'dark', 'tattoos', 'heart', 'gold', 'Having', 'been', 'paralyzed', 'accident', 'caused', 'best', 'friend', 'high', 'school', 'Christopher', 'Igoe', 'two', 'have', 'not', 'spoken', 'years', 'guilt', 'fear', 'anger', 'film', 'down', 'see', 'softening', 'attitude', 'Mark', 'Zupan', 'part', 'two', 'come', 'together', 'offish', 'very', 'touching', 'way.The', 'other', 'main', 'focus', 'documentary', 'Joe', 'Soares', 'bitter', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'position', 'team', 'America', 'now', 'Rugby', 'wheels', 'Canadian', 'team', 'coach', 'fly', 'two', 'teams', 'meet', 'up', 'first', 'time', 'Joe', 'Soares', 'took', 'over', 'Canadian', 'team', 'Joe', 'also', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'what', 'doing', 'remember', 'most', 'important', 'things', 'life', 'wife', 'son', 'first', 'absolutely', 'hated', 'Joe', 'film', 'rolled', 'changes', 'Joe', 'life', 'were', 'forced', 'began', 'understand', 'position', 'viewer', 'also', 'see', 'Joe', 'grow', 'self-centeredness', 'more', 'loving', 'father', 'husband.The', 'final', 'focus', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Kevin', 'who', 'newly', 'acquainted', 'wheelchair', 'becoming', 'quadriplegic', 'motorcycle', 'accident', 'bitter', 'angry', 'depressed', 'things', ""'d"", 'expect', 'suffering', 'such', 'horrific', 'life-change', 'Mark', 'Zupan', 'wheelchair', 'Rugby', 'Murderball', 'Kevin', 'instantly', 'hooked', 'Life', 'new', 'meaning', 'Kevin', 'obviously', 'existence', 'still', 'value', 'great', 'set', 'scenes', ""'ll"", 'end', 'review', 'mentioning', 'special', 'features', 'came', 'DVD', 'Johnnie', 'Knoxville', 'Steve-O', 'Jackass', 'TV', 'series', 'party', 'several', 'members', 'U.S.', 'Paralympic', 'Wheelchair', 'Rugby', 'team', 'great', 'thing', 'behold', 'Not', 'only', 'show', 'how', 'amiable', 'wheelchair-bound', 'guys', 'are', 'also', 'how', 'chairs', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'slightest', 'punching', 'other', 'using', 'cattle', 'prods', 'jumping', 'off', 'ramps', 'chairs', 'swimming', 'pools']",Murderball

936250,AKHJVOYEX6QME,B000B5XP24,"Colleen McMahon ""&#34;Omnivorous Reader&#34;""","[3, 4]","Murderball is a documentary about the US Paralympic Rugby Team and their quest for the 2004 Olympic gold medal, and its also the story of several men, wheelchair-bound for various reasons, from injury to polio, and their struggle to live a normal life in the face of their challenges.  The documentary focuses most closely on one of the star players, Mark Zupan, and the former star player who now coaches the Canadian team and has a strong yearning to beat his former teammates, many of whom consider him a traitor.  Most affectingly, the movie also features the struggles of a newly quadraplegic man who is starting out from the place these athletes once did.  We see him slowly work his way through rehab, learning to use his chair and perform basic tasks all over again.  It's thrilling to see the way he comes to life when he meets Zupan and has his first try in a rugby wheelchair.I saw the movie several weeks ago but it has stayed with me, particularly the story of the newly injured young man and the glimpse of Iraq vets in rehab taking their first stab at wheelchair rugby.  While the drama of the medal quest is exciting and suspenseful, the parts I remember are the private glimpses into these men's lives:  the slow and painstaking process of dressing and getting in and out of the chair, the discussions of whether and how ""quads"" have sex, the relationships between the men and their loved ones.  It was an exciting and eye-opening movie.Be sure to check out the extras and commentaries, especially the Jackass special with several of the rugby players taking part in the same goofy, painful stunts that the Jackass guys usually engage in--almost as much fun as the movie itself!",5,"Amazing, Exciting, Heartbreaking--Just Don't Call it Inspirational",1160611200,"10 12, 2006",2006,1695,"['Murderball', 'documentary', 'US', 'Paralympic', 'Rugby', 'Team', 'quest', '2004', 'Olympic', 'gold', 'medal', 'also', 'story', 'several', 'men', 'wheelchair-bound', 'various', 'reasons', 'injury', 'polio', 'struggle', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'face', 'challenges', 'documentary', 'focuses', 'most', 'closely', 'one', 'star', 'players', 'Mark', 'Zupan', 'former', 'star', 'player', 'who', 'now', 'Canadian', 'team', 'strong', 'yearning', 'beat', 'former', 'teammates', 'many', 'whom', 'consider', 'traitor', 'Most', 'affectingly', 'movie', 'also', 'struggles', 'newly', 'quadraplegic', 'man', 'who', 'starting', 'out', 'place', 'athletes', 'once', 'did', 'see', 'slowly', 'work', 'way', 'rehab', 'learning', 'use', 'chair', 'perform', 'basic', 'tasks', 'over', 'again', 'thrilling', 'see', 'way', 'life', 'when', 'Zupan', 'first', 'try', 'rugby', 'wheelchair.I', 'saw', 'movie', 'several', 'weeks', 'ago', 'stayed', 'particularly', 'story', 'newly', 'injured', 'young', 'man', 'glimpse', 'Iraq', 'vets', 'rehab', 'taking', 'first', 'stab', 'wheelchair', 'rugby', 'drama', 'medal', 'quest', 'exciting', 'suspenseful', 'parts', 'remember', 'are', 'private', 'glimpses', 'men', 'lives', 'slow', 'painstaking', 'process', 'dressing', 'getting', 'chair', 'discussions', 'how', 'quads', 'have', 'sex', 'relationships', 'men', 'loved', 'ones', 'was', 'exciting', 'eye-opening', 'movie.Be', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'extras', 'commentaries', 'especially', 'Jackass', 'special', 'several', 'rugby', 'players', 'taking', 'part', 'same', 'goofy', 'painful', 'stunts', 'Jackass', 'guys', 'usually', 'engage', 'almost', 'much', 'fun', 'movie']",Murderball

Schmidt,"[0, 0]","I agree with the people featured in the film when they say that this is a sports story and not a pity story about handicapped people.Murderball follows the US National Quad rugby team over a couple years and focuses on 1. the players and how they got to where they are and 2. the US rivalry with Canada's team.The first point of focus shows how the players ended up in their wheelchairs. One man was infected with a rare bacteria in his childhood and lost most of his arms and his legs, one was thrown off of a deck, one was thrown from a truck and was not found for almost 14 hours.A couple of non team members are also highlighted. Joe Soares, an ex US star, who was Canada's head coach (many hard feelings there) had polio and Keith, a recently injured young man, was in a motocross accident.All of the individuals chose to overcome their difficulties to succeed and end up doing things that they would not have done otherwise. It is interesting to see the team at the top of their game cntrasted with Keith who is relearning how to do things only four months after his accident.The second point of focus follows the bad blood between team USA and Canada's team that stems from Joe Soares's being cut from the US team due to old age and slowness, attempting to sue the US team and then taking a head coach position for Canada. It seems his sole goal in life is to beat the US team. The US team, Mark Zupan in particular, detest Soares and the tension makes for a great rivalry.The film itself is fantastic and the special features are very good. A follow up interview with Soares, an hour Larry King interview, player and filmaker commentaries and behind the scenes featurette are all worth watching.The sole extra that I could have done without is the one with the guys from MTV's Jackass.

Murderball follows neither lead, and comes up completely humanistic and original.Essentially it's the story of the US Olympic Wheelchair Rugby team, and their quest to win the gold.  Among their rivals is their most hated enemy: the Canadians.  Within this setup, we see happiness and elation, as well as agony, embarrassment, and frustration.  As if he were cast for the role of confrontational antagonist, the Canadian team is led by Joe Soares, a foul-mouthed former pioneer and legend of US Wheelchair Rugby who many consider a traitor.  He didn't make the US team on his last try-out and he's vulgarly, bitterly protested ever since.  His counterpart is the US superstar Mark Zuban, a somewhat brash player who typifies the younger, aggressive generation, but still manages to become the face of quad-rugby, inspiring others through seminars and discussions.Given that the documentary is named Murderball, I expected much more action and many more brutal hits from the armored wheelchairs that are used during competition.  There isn't nearly enough focus given to the sport itself.  Instead, the drama surrounding personal lives was the true focus, a borderline voyeuristic look into the players' lives.  There were no corners cut, nor were there falsehoods.  Those who are quadriplegic can find love and happiness, and will almost inevitably face further life difficulties.  What struck me was the balance between positive traits and negative flaws, where one can be humble yet heroic, and another could be internally frail yet outwardly, defiantly strong.It's a great character study and very compelling.  It achieves its purpose: showing that the quad rugby players are just like us ""normal"" people.

(The game is referred to as ""Murderball,"" but as one of the players remarks, ""it's hard to market a sport named 'Murderball!'"").The requirements to be a team member: Quadriplegia. And an incredible hard-hitting and competitive spirit. (Most of us, my wife included... who IS wheelchair-bound due to multiple sclerosis, were under the impression that quadriplegics had NO use of their arms, but it would seem that many quadriplegics retain a certain degree of arm and upper-body function.)The stars of this film are inspirational. Bob Lujano is a young man who lost his arms and legs to a horrible infection as a young boy. Sitting with a group of school children, he's asked by a little girl, ""how do you eat pizza with your elbows?"" He proceeds to show them, and there is no shock or revulsion. The children are all awe-struck and smiling as this man proves that you can make your life as normal as it can possibly be, if you try.(How many people, given a pair of gnarled stumps for arms, would live out their lives being spoon-fed by others? Quite a few, no doubt.)The ""star"" of the film, if there is one, is Mark Zupan, a 28-year-old who's life changed when the pickup truck driven by his best friend flew off the road... and he sailed into a canal --where he remained clinging to a branch, undiscovered for 14 hours. Zupan is the kind of guy who takes no crap from anyone. Even his high school buddies point out, ""he was an a****** before the accident, and the accident didn't change him!"" But it'sobvious that they, along with pretty much everyone else loves him, and during the course of the movie it becomes pretty clear why. He's a good friend to have.Joe Soares is the FORMER team member who became the head coach of the US team's arch-rivals, Canada. The man is EXTREMELY tightly-wound, but despite the red-faced, screaming rants, there are some very tender moments shown between him and his young son. His son, who has NOT followed in his father's extreme-sports footsteps, somewhat to his dad's disappointment, is instead an academic high-achiever, and plays (of all things) the violinin the school band. It is a testament to good parenting (and one of many grab-the-handkerchief moments!) to see how Soares supports his son.The film should be shown to every high school class in America. People deal with the handicapped in very odd, and many times, disturbing ways. If enough people saw this, not only would it give people a better understanding of some of the struggles faced by the disabled, but it would also serve as an inspiration for all. (In fact, my wife hasn't been in our pool for over a year because of her fear that it wouldn't 'go well.' After seeing murderball, she's planning on going for a swim tomorrow!)*** UPDATE: The swim went just fine, and in the year since, my wife has become FAR MORE confident about herself. She is still 100% wheelchair-bound, but it's something that people forget about in about 2 minutes BECAUSE of her terrific attitude. And MURDERBALL played a part.*** UPDATE 2: We had the opportunity to go to a Wheelchair Rugby tournament in Tampa --and thought we MIGHT see someone we recognized. Well, we not only SAW, but had a chance to chat and hang out with MARK ZUPAN, SCOTT HOGSETT and ANDY COHN, among others.  What a GREAT bunch of guys! This was months after the release of the DVD, so frankly they could have seen themselves as ""stars,"" but you sure couldn't tell.The highlight of the day came when Scott Hogsett asked us if we'd like to join them for dinner... and though our schedule wouldn't allow this, the mere fact that they asked just made our day.

What I thought of was a bunch of disabled guys getting together to throw the ball around  for no other reason but that they wouldn't feel sorry for themselves. (It is hard to admit, but that is the vision I had.)This film - Murderball, which is the original name of ""quad rugby"" - is a mind-changer. And unlike other films portraying people with disabilities, this film does an excellent job in not apologizing for its subject. What do I mean? With many films and shows about people with disabilities, we are supposed to either feel sorry for their subjects, feel sorry that we are feeling sorry for our subjects, or watch a film that ""politely"" deals with the subjects' disabilities.This film is no good at apologizing and certainly is not polite. It centers around the American and Canadian quad rugby teams as they prepare for the 2004 Athens olympics, and we meet a bunch of guys who, quite frankly, would kick your a** were you to pat them on the head (as we often subconsciously do to wheelchair inhabitants). (One character says, at the beginning, ""What, you won't hit a guy in a chair? Hit me. I'll hit you back."")We watch the teams - particularly the American team - train for the Olympics. In so doing, we get to peer into their personal lives: they talk about how they became quadrapolegics, how they got turned on to rugby, and even - cough - frank discussion about how they have sex (I told you this was not a typical polite ""disability"" film). We see perfections, imperfections, and real, real life.The film is quite captivating in that we are (a) learning about a sport most of us have never watched or thought we'd watch; (b) learning about people who we've always been interested in but never asked about; and (c) are following an adventure story to see if the always-dominant American team can retain their dominance against a very-hungry Candadian team. All three of these factors are equally integrated into the film and one never feels like the film is subsumed by any one of them. Guys. Sports. Paralysis. An interesting triangle, but one which works here.See the film.

936262,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B000B5XP24,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[4, 4]","""Murderball"" is nothing short of brilliant.  Hats off to the filmmakers of this documentary for a compelling look at a violent sport (quadroplegic indoor rugby), the men who set the tone and the mood for it and the real people behind those public visages.  This is a tale about overcoming adversity and getting your life back after circumstance has taken it away.  The real life Murderball players are from all walks of life.  They reached the point in their lives where their desire to overcome adversity, commitment, and skills, allowed them to focus on becoming winners.The filmmakers never preach in this film.  They present reality as reality. They give us slices of the players' lives, their loves, their foibles.  They shot the film from the viewpoint of sitting in a wheelchair; it is an intimate look at what the view is from there.  We see the struggle putting clothes on, rolling over, tackling a task such as taking your shoes off.  We get to experience the laughter and the joy of finding out that you can still enjoy sex, and the casts' surprisingly good humor about the endless fascination some females have for men in wheelchairs.  We also see how self-sufficient is a man who can hustle himself and all his equipment through an airport; for whom international travel has become a reality and a frequent opportunity at the highest echelons of the sport.  The directors concentrate on what makes a team a team, and how team pride, at this level, uplifts to pride in the country you play for.  There's some brief explanation of the rules of wheelchair rugby, but mostly you get the feel of the action by watching slices of the USA's matches against their arch-rivals, the Canadian team.  Particularly telling is a feature that shows the amount of points a team can have on the floor at any one moment.  Players are ranked by the ""deepness"" of their disability with 1-3 points.  No team can have more than 8 points on the floor at once.  A revelation.We also get to see those unique personalities that abound in every sport at the highest level of play....Mark Zuban, a true hotshot in every aspect of what that word means.  He's mean, he's brutally honest, in fantastic condition and the heart of Team USA.  Despite his outward cockiness and bravado, he takes the time to talk about his sport to groups of the newly disabled...in a matter of fact, interesting way, that is its own uplift.There's a bit of a sidetrack in Mark's story, where he is reconciled with his best friend, the driver who caused him to fly from a vehicle and sustain his life threatening injuries.It's not a bad story, but probably the weakest link in the film.Joe Soares is Zuban's  antithesis, but is he?  Unarguably the greatest player in the world, Joe was sidelined by Team USA as he got older and bitterly began to coach for Canada (although he lives in Tampa, Florida).  Joe's opinionated, pushy, and a family man.  We get to see him and his disdain for his son (who is a ""non-athlete"" and musician) before he has a heart attack, and the change in him after the heart attack leaves him feeling rather mortal.  Joe never becomes a villain.  We understand why Team USA is upset about his new allegiance, we understand why Joe did what he did.  We can see his coaching skill in the way that his Canadian players respond to him.  Joe is tough love personified.When the teams and players are cemented in your mind, the directors introduce Keith Cavill, who has been newly introduced to the world of the quadriplegic.  It is through Keith's story that we see how far these men have come; how daunting is the world when you are first forced to realize what kinds of challenges you will face for the rest of your life.  Without giving you an emotional bath, the filmmakers show you what happens to Keith's mindset when he's first introduced to the world of quad rugby, and how it changes his perspective.There are not enough fine words of praise for the crafting that went into this film, for the ""acting"" of the principals, for the tone, the camerawork, the script, the editing.

936265,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000B5XP24,mirasreviews,"[2, 2]","""Murderball"" is a essentially a sports movie that balances the parts about the game and its athletes with some lessons in what life is like for quadriplegics. That's because the sport is quad rugby. Invented in the 1970s in Canada and originally called ""murderball"", quad rugby is wheelchair sport  played by quadriplegics, people with impairment of varying degrees in all four limbs. To score, players must wheel into the end zones while in possession of the ball. They get there by passing and carrying. They block their opponents by smashing into them in armored souped-up wheel chairs.  Director Dana Adam Shapiro and cinematographer Henry Alex-Rubin followed 4 of the United States' best quad rugby players from the 2002 Wheelchair Rugby World Championship in Sweden to the 2004 Paralympics in Athens, Greece, as well as Joe Soares, a former U.S. player who left to coach the U.S.' arch-rival Canadian team amid heated accusations of betrayal.It would have been enough to make a documentary about the sport of quad rugby without trying to be educational. It's an exciting sport that few people are familiar with. But if the filmmakers focus on the athletes, they can't avoid the subject of how much or little physical function the players have, what they can or cannot do. Then the audience, and probably the filmmakers too, begins to wonder: How did these men become disabled? How do they feel about it? What do they do outside of quad rugby? So ""Murderball"" anticipates those questions. We learn about the sport, what it means to these athletes, and how being a quadriplegic has changed their lives -and how it hasn't. ""Murderball"" leaves no nagging curiosity unanswered.I want to emphasize that ""Murderball"" is not a depressing film. I think is suffered for that misconception at the box office. These athletes are not disabled in the sense that I normally use the word. They are totally independent and can do most routine tasks for themselves, albeit sometimes differently from able-bodied people. People have to be fairly functional to play wheelchair sports; they have to propel the wheelchair. The 5 athletes -Mark Zupan, Scott Hogsett, Andy Cohn, Bob Lujano, and Joe Soares- have strong, vibrant personalities, the type that like to throw themselves into life in a physical way. They're thrilled to be playing a competitive contact sport in spite of their limitations. And their enthusiasm is infectious. And I learned some things about quadriplegics that I didn't know before. These guys are frank and funny and don't hesitate to express their annoyance with the misplaced pity of able-bodied people. ""Murderball"" is a fun film, and these athletes are more interesting than most pro football or basketball stars.The DVD (ThinkFilm 2005): Bonus features include 4 featurettes, 6 deleted scenes, a tidbit from the ""NY City Premier"" (2 min) that has bad sound, and 2 audio commentaries. In ""CNN Larry King Live Interview"" (40 min), 4 of the film's athletes plus new quad rugby player Keith Cavill talk to King about their lives, the movie and take some phone calls. In ""Jackass Presents: Murderball"" (20 min), Mark, Scott, and Andy hang out with the guys from ""Jackass"", so you can imagine. ""Murderball: Behind the Game"" (18 min) includes interviews in which the players talk about the game, themselves, Joe's defection to Canada, and the movie. In ""Joe Soares Update Interview"" (10 min), Joe talks about what he's doing now, his view of the movie, and his youth in Portugal and the U.S.  There is an audio commentary by Mark Zupan, Scott Hogsett, and Andy Cohn which is a free-flowing scene-by-scene commentary of their opinions and memories. There is also a filmmaker commentary by Director Dana Adam Shapiro, cinematographer/co-director Henry Alex-Rubin, and producer Jeff Mandel. They discuss the film's structure, the choice of scenes to illustrate the film's themes, and the athletes.

The men and the film stay away from dwelling on the sympathetic element of what has happened in their lives and builds suspence about their goal for a gold medal for the U.S. team.

936271,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000B5XP24,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 9]","Murderball (Henry Alex Rubin and Dana Adam Shapiro, 2005)What is there to say about Murderball that hasn't already been said? (Plenty, actually, but none of it belongs in a review.) It's a movie-- a documentary-- about a bunch of guys who play quad rugby, AKA murderball. It's coarse, nasty, brutish, violent, and I enjoyed every second of it.The word most bandied about on the DVD case is ""inspirational,"" and honestly, I have to say I didn't get that at all. Fascinating, yes, but not inspirational; one of Mark Zupan's friends comments at his high school reunion that ""he was an [censored] before the chair, so you can't blame it on the chair."" When it comes right down to it, while Zupan is the most flamboyant of the people portrayed in this film, and thus gets much of the screen time, what you're not going to find in this movie is too many people who are no more sympathetic than Zupan. It's quite doubtful you'll like any of these folks; the ones who seem as if they may be likable (Zupan's girlfriend, Joe Soares' kid) are pushed off to the side, only appearing in the movie now and again in order to illustrate some larger point about the film's actual subjects. Can you see the manipulation? Of course you can, but this is a documentary; in an age when Michael Moore can call his movies ""documentaries"" and get away with it, you should expect it.All that said, you will love to hate these people. Just because someone isn't likable doesn't mean he's not interesting (after all, would the History Channel exist if not for the life of Adolf Hitler?). These guys are fun to watch, pure and simple.The movie does fall short a number of times in technical aspects. I wondered a number of times why a documentary that ran less than ninety minutes seemed to need to edit out so much of the actual games they played; the footage remaining tends to be confusing at best.

Zwick,"[4, 5]","If, like the rest of us, you spend most of your time pissing and moaning over the seeming unfairness and petty inconveniences of everyday life, I suggest you check out ""Murderball"" for an immediate attitude readjustment.  This fascinating documentary will put all of that stuff into perspective for you, while entertaining the hell out of you at the same time.Played on a regulation-sized basketball court (minus the baskets), Murderball is actually a slang name for Wheelchair Rugby, an international sport in which quadriplegics use their specially armored wheelchairs almost like souped-up bumper cars to score goals for their team.  The film concentrates, primarily, on the intense and sometimes downright vicious rivalry between the team from the United States and the team from Canada.  The moviemakers introduce us to about a half dozen players, each of whom, even in the few moments afforded him on screen, becomes a distinct personality with a history to relate and a story to tell.  The two main focal points are the charismatic and muscular Mark Zupan, and Joe Soares, one of the legendary pioneers of the sport who left to coach for Canada after he was cut from the American team.  Many of the most incisive scenes deal with the ribbing, some of it good-natured, some of it not so good-natured, that Soares has had to endure over his decision to defect to the opposing side.Although the rugby scenes themselves are gripping and thrilling, the real drama occurs off the court in the men`s personal lives, as we see the struggle and heartbreak the men go through, the strength and inspiration they exhibit for the rest of us, and, most especially, the camaraderie and team spirit that comes with working together to achieve a common goal.  As the filmmaking crew follows the men around through the course of their daily lives, we get to know them as complex individuals, finding out how they ended up in a wheelchair and seeing how each was able to rise above the experience to get to where he is today.  The film neither sugarcoats the difficulties of their lives nor asks for our pity.  It simply presents the men to us, in all their virtues and flaws, and asks that we listen in on their stories.  Some of the most poignant moments involve Soares having to come to terms with having a son who has little or no interest in sports, preferring the violin instead.Kudos to directors Henry Alex Rubin and Dana Adam Shapiro for their fine work on this film, especially Rubin, who also provided the stunning camerawork for the scenes on the court.  But most of our thanks should go to the men of the film and their loved ones who were willing to open up their lives to us in so vivid and honest a way.  This is an inspiring and heartwarming film - the final scene is of some of the men introducing the sport to a number of injured Iraq War veterans - that will stick with you long after the closing credits.",4,excellent documentary,1152748800,"07 13, 2006",2006,2913,"['rest', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'pissing', 'moaning', 'seeming', 'unfairness', 'petty', 'inconveniences', 'everyday', 'life', 'suggest', 'check', 'Murderball', 'immediate', 'attitude', 'readjustment', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'will', 'put', 'stuff', 'perspective', 'entertaining', 'hell', 'same', 'time.Played', 'regulation-sized', 'basketball', 'court', 'baskets', 'Murderball', 'actually', 'slang', 'name', 'Wheelchair', 'Rugby', 'international', 'sport', 'quadriplegics', 'use', 'specially', 'armored', 'almost', 'souped-up', 'bumper', 'cars', 'score', 'goals', 'team', 'film', 'concentrates', 'primarily', 'intense', 'sometimes', 'downright', 'vicious', 'rivalry', 'team', 'United', 'States', 'team', 'Canada', 'moviemakers', 'introduce', 'half', 'dozen', 'players', 'whom', 'even', 'few', 'moments', 'afforded', 'screen', 'distinct', 'personality', 'history', 'relate', 'story', 'tell', 'two', 'main', 'focal', 'points', 'are', 'charismatic', 'muscular', 'Mark', 'Zupan', 'Joe', 'Soares', 'one', 'legendary', 'pioneers', 'sport', 'who', 'left', 'coach', 'Canada', 'was', 'cut', 'American', 'team', 'Many', 'most', 'incisive', 'scenes', 'deal', 'ribbing', 'good-natured', 'not', 'so', 'good-natured', 'had', 'endure', 'over', 'decision', 'defect', 'opposing', 'rugby', 'are', 'gripping', 'thrilling', 'real', 'drama', 'court', 'men', 's', 'personal', 'lives', 'see', 'struggle', 'heartbreak', 'men', 'go', 'strength', 'inspiration', 'exhibit', 'rest', 'most', 'especially', 'camaraderie', 'team', 'spirit', 'working', 'together', 'achieve', 'common', 'goal', 'filmmaking', 'crew', 'men', 'course', 'daily', 'lives', 'get', 'know', 'complex', 'individuals', 'finding', 'out', 'how', 'ended', 'up', 'wheelchair', 'seeing', 'how', 'was', 'able', 'rise', 'experience', 'get', 'where', 'today', 'film', 'sugarcoats', 'difficulties', 'lives', 'asks', 'pity', 'simply', 'men', 'virtues', 'flaws', 'listen', 'stories', 'most', 'poignant', 'moments', 'involve', 'having', 'come', 'terms', 'having', 'son', 'who', 'little', 'interest', 'sports', 'preferring', 'violin', 'instead.Kudos', 'directors', 'Henry', 'Alex', 'Rubin', 'Dana', 'Adam', 'Shapiro', 'fine', 'work', 'film', 'especially', 'Rubin', 'who', 'also', 'provided', 'stunning', 'camerawork', 'scenes', 'court', 'most', 'thanks', 'should', 'go', 'men', 'film', 'loved', 'ones', 'who', 'were', 'willing', 'open', 'up', 'lives', 'so', 'vivid', 'honest', 'way', 'inspiring', 'heartwarming', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'men', 'introducing', 'sport', 'number', 'injured', 'Iraq', 'War', 'will', 'stick', 'long', 'closing', 'credits']",Murderball

It's a documentary about the US Wheelchair rugby team, that compete and go to the Paralympics in Athens, Greece in 2004.The film follows some of the players in their life, how they got to be in a wheelchair, and how they fight to win at the Championships and the Paralympics.Powerful stuff. You'll laugh - you'll cry. I did. Plus, not only fun, it's educational.First, we meet Mark, a cutie pie tough guy with tats and attitude. He introduces us to the game. We later meet his girlfriend, parents, and best buddy from high school.Other men on the team, all adorable, strong, very nice men, all working for the goal of the big win. All with stories of their own.These men are strong, courageous, daring, fearless, and inspirational.I recommend this to kids over 10 or 12, and anyone that may be feeling sorry for themselves. My dear Norman has a limp, from a gunshot wound (back in his CIA days.. long story..) he's a good man, but, like men do, he feels a bit sorry for himself, just once in a while. So, I bought this DVD, made popcorn, and we watched it last night.I don't know if he got my point, but, he seemed to enjoy it. Men and their sports, you know. My point was - if you don't know by now - is that when you feel you have it bad, there is always someone that has it worse. So, stop complaining! I especially liked the young man with no arms or legs, to illustrate my point. He was sweet, a great player, and self-sufficient at home. No laying around crying for him!!The reason I say, good for kids, older kids that is, a LOT of swearing - don't be shocked, but for kids to learn about disabled people is a good thing. To learn to care about others, to have compassion, and to not be afraid of the disabled or handicapped.

There are no helmets, no shin guards, only speed, determination, and how hard you can slam your chair into your opponent to make them give up the ball/slow them down.The documentary traces the players of Team USA: Mark Zupan, Keith Cavill, Andy Cohn, Scott Hogsett, and Bob Lujano, on their quest to capture the gold medal at the 2004 Paralympics in Athens. In a parallel storyline, former quad rugby star Joe Soares has jumped ship and is coaching Team Canada, leading to a bitter rivalry between the two teams.""Murderball"" is fast-paced and furious, with loads of on-the-court wheel-cam action, a great soundtrack (I loved the haunting cello theme), tight editing, and fun moments just hanging out with Team USA to witness pranks, parties, and pick-up lines. There is graphic talk of sex as a quadriplegic, the frustrations of physical rehab and life after injury, old wounds reopened, a medical emergency, and a look at baby-faced Iraq War vets with missing limbs (they looked about fifteen) at Walter Reed Army Hospital. Part of what makes ""Murderball"" so effective as a documentary is its laid-back approach to interviews and capturing candid moments. The players aren't made out to be heroes or saints; only as human as the rest of us. Inspiring, dramatic, and a worthy tribute to the formidable Team USA.The DVD contains a Larry King interview, Johnny Knoxville Murderball special with Mark Zupan, a featurette, interview with Joe Soares, deleted scenes, filmmaker commentary, player commentary, an update on Keith's chair, and more.

They call it quad rugby - you know, sponsors would not like it called `murderball' - but probably this unofficial name would be more appropriate to describe the tension and excitement of watching the players do full-contact rugby on the court, hitting their chariot-like wheel chair against another player's which often tips over, even breaking neck.The documentary covers the life of select group of quadriplegics during two years 2002-2004. The film records their private life, introducing their family and loves, but the most memorable part of the film would be the heated rivalry between Team American and Team Canada. America's player Mark Zupan, who reminds us of candid punk rockers, makes a great contrast with Team Canada's coach Joe Soares, formerly member of Team USA, who went to Canada after the break-up with the team.Some American players hate Joe, and reveal candidly their feelings about him before the camera, which is quite understandable. Their hard-nosed attitudes are genuine one as you witness during the three games between Canada and USA. The games become more thrilling to watch because of their joy and disappointment, which are really moving. It sounds like a story made for Hollywood movies. but this story has more truths in it because of the people the film captures.The film shows their flaws, even their personal demons, but not in condescending way. `Murderball' is not just about the sports; it is a success because it shows the people. And you may not believe me, but it is sometimes funny, too.",5,"It's Not Just About the Sports; It's About People: Riveting, Moving and Even Funny Sometimes",1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,1685,"['Murderball', 'deservedly', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Documentary', 'Features', 'category', 'features', 'quadriplegics', 'who', 'play', 'rugby', 'custom-made', 'wheelchair', 'call', 'rugby', 'know', 'sponsors', 'would', 'not', 'like', 'called', 'murderball', 'probably', 'unofficial', 'name', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'describe', 'tension', 'excitement', 'watching', 'players', 'do', 'full-contact', 'rugby', 'court', 'hitting', 'chariot-like', 'wheel', 'chair', 'player', 'often', 'even', 'breaking', 'neck.The', 'documentary', 'covers', 'life', 'select', 'group', 'quadriplegics', 'two', 'years', '2002-2004', 'film', 'records', 'private', 'life', 'introducing', 'family', 'loves', 'most', 'memorable', 'part', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'heated', 'rivalry', 'Team', 'American', 'Team', 'Canada', 'America', 'player', 'Mark', 'Zupan', 'who', 'candid', 'punk', 'rockers', 'great', 'contrast', 'Team', 'Canada', 'coach', 'Joe', 'Soares', 'formerly', 'member', 'Team', 'USA', 'who', 'went', 'Canada', 'break-up', 'team.Some', 'American', 'players', 'hate', 'Joe', 'reveal', 'candidly', 'feelings', 'camera', 'quite', 'understandable', 'hard-nosed', 'attitudes', 'are', 'genuine', 'one', 'witness', 'three', 'games', 'Canada', 'USA', 'games', 'become', 'more', 'thrilling', 'watch', 'joy', 'disappointment', 'are', 'really', 'moving', 'story', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'story', 'more', 'truths', 'people', 'film', 'captures.The', 'film', 'flaws', 'even', 'personal', 'demons', 'not', 'condescending', 'way', 'not', 'just', 'sports', 'success', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'believe', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'too']",Murderball

Many Americans take pride in the game of American football and consider it the most manly of sports.  For those that do, they've never seen or played in a rugby game.  Rugby is kind of like American football, except without the pads.  The game has been popular internationally for years (especially in countries that once were ruled by the British crown) and is slowly gaining in popularity in the U.S.MURDERBALL is a documentary about a bunch of Americans who play rugby at the highest level.  That in itself makes for a fascinating documentary.  But the best part is that the players featured in MURDERBALL aren't ordinary players: each one of the players is a quadriplegic who plays in their wheelchair.  I've seen some games of rugby and played in a couple of pick-up games, but those games are tame compared the games shown in MURDERBALL.  These guys play a vicious and hardcore game.The film follows some of the most prominent members of the U.S. Team over a two-year period, from 2002-2004 between international competitions.  The film examines some of the players' routines, their family lives, and what they do besides playing ""murderball"".  They talk openly about their injuries, their sex lives, and how they started playing the game.The film tries to follow several different players, but it focuses on two particular individuals who are the defining personalities of the story.  On the one hand there is Mark Zupan.  Zupan is one of the bigger stars of the American team.  Zupan is cocky, brazen, rough, and defiant.  In many ways he is the stereotype of the typical American jock.  Contrasted with Zupan is Joe Soares.  Soares is a legend in the sport.  He is bull-headed and has a nasty temper, but he is a master of the game as well as being a devoted father and husband.  Early in the film Soares is hoping to be hired to coach the American team, but when he is passed over for someone else, he accepts an offer from Team Canada to be the coach of their team.  Many of the American players, including Zupan, consider Soares departure a betrayal and view him as a traitor to his country.  But things aren't that simple, Soares is a man who loves the sport and is willing to do anything to stay involved; it is his passion.There are three games of murderball that the film shows which happen in the three acts of the film's framework.  The first game happens at the beginning of the film, the second near the middle, and the final game (between Team USA and Team Canada) happens towards the end.  The games themselves are fascinating to watch, but they are the more compelling because of knowing who some of the players are and part of the drama and story of their lives.I found MURDERBALL to be a fascinating film about a fascinating story and I highly recommend it.MURDERBALL was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Feature Documentary in 2006.",5,Pressing On.,1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,2994,"['Rugby', 'violent', 'yet', 'fascinating', 'sport', 'American', 'football', 'look', 'bunch', 'teenagers', 'playing', 'nurf', 'ball', 'Many', 'Americans', 'take', 'pride', 'game', 'American', 'football', 'consider', 'most', 'manly', 'sports', 'do', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'played', 'rugby', 'game', 'Rugby', 'kind', 'like', 'American', 'football', 'pads', 'game', 'been', 'popular', 'internationally', 'years', 'especially', 'countries', 'once', 'were', 'ruled', 'British', 'crown', 'slowly', 'gaining', 'popularity', 'U.S.MURDERBALL', 'documentary', 'bunch', 'Americans', 'who', 'play', 'rugby', 'highest', 'level', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'best', 'part', 'players', 'featured', 'MURDERBALL', 'are', ""n't"", 'ordinary', 'players', 'one', 'players', 'quadriplegic', 'who', 'wheelchair', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'games', 'rugby', 'played', 'couple', 'pick-up', 'games', 'games', 'are', 'tame', 'compared', 'games', 'shown', 'MURDERBALL', 'guys', 'play', 'vicious', 'hardcore', 'game.The', 'film', 'most', 'prominent', 'members', 'U.S', 'Team', 'two-year', 'period', '2002-2004', 'international', 'competitions', 'film', 'players', 'routines', 'family', 'lives', 'what', 'do', 'playing', 'murderball', 'talk', 'openly', 'injuries', 'sex', 'lives', 'how', 'started', 'playing', 'game.The', 'film', 'tries', 'follow', 'several', 'different', 'players', 'two', 'particular', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'defining', 'personalities', 'story', 'one', 'hand', 'Mark', 'Zupan', 'Zupan', 'one', 'bigger', 'stars', 'American', 'team', 'Zupan', 'cocky', 'brazen', 'rough', 'defiant', 'many', 'ways', 'stereotype', 'typical', 'American', 'jock', 'Contrasted', 'Zupan', 'Joe', 'Soares', 'Soares', 'legend', 'sport', 'bull-headed', 'nasty', 'temper', 'master', 'game', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'devoted', 'father', 'husband', 'Early', 'film', 'Soares', 'hoping', 'be', 'hired', 'coach', 'American', 'team', 'when', 'passed', 'someone', 'else', 'offer', 'Team', 'Canada', 'be', 'coach', 'team', 'Many', 'American', 'players', 'including', 'Zupan', 'consider', 'Soares', 'departure', 'betrayal', 'view', 'traitor', 'country', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'that', 'simple', 'Soares', 'man', 'who', 'sport', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'stay', 'involved', 'passion.There', 'are', 'three', 'games', 'murderball', 'film', 'shows', 'happen', 'three', 'acts', 'film', 'framework', 'first', 'game', 'beginning', 'film', 'second', 'middle', 'final', 'game', 'Team', 'USA', 'Team', 'Canada', 'end', 'games', 'are', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'are', 'more', 'compelling', 'knowing', 'who', 'players', 'are', 'part', 'drama', 'story', 'lives.I', 'found', 'MURDERBALL', 'be', 'fascinating', 'film', 'fascinating', 'story', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.MURDERBALL', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Feature', 'Documentary', '2006']",Murderball
