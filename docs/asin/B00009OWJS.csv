756121,A1JH5J1KQAUBMP,B00009OWJS,David Bonesteel,"[1, 1]","In 1963, a kid from Brooklyn (Matt Dillon) takes a summer job as a cabana boy at a ritzy beach resort serving the wealthy instead of learning about hard work by taking an office job that his father (Hector Elizondo) has arranged for him.  He becomes enthralled by a flashy car salesman (Richard Crenna) who is the reigning king at the gin rummy table and has a beautiful daughter (Janet Jones).This is a pleasant enough film with good performances and valuable messages about hard work and paying attention to the people who love you.  The only problem was that the screenplay was so clearly written in service of these messages that every single plot strand played out exactly as I expected it to, which made the story feel a bit mechanical.",3,Honor thy father,1275868800,"06 7, 2010",2010,742,"['1963', 'kid', 'Brooklyn', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'summer', 'job', 'cabana', 'boy', 'ritzy', 'beach', 'resort', 'serving', 'wealthy', 'instead', 'learning', 'hard', 'work', 'taking', 'office', 'job', 'father', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'arranged', 'enthralled', 'flashy', 'car', 'salesman', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'who', 'reigning', 'king', 'gin', 'rummy', 'table', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'Janet', 'Jones', '.This', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'film', 'good', 'performances', 'valuable', 'messages', 'hard', 'work', 'paying', 'attention', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'screenplay', 'was', 'so', 'clearly', 'written', 'service', 'messages', 'single', 'plot', 'strand', 'played', 'out', 'exactly', 'expected', 'made', 'story', 'feel', 'bit', 'mechanical']",N/A
756122,A2SNUORW55MZWO,B00009OWJS,J-Train,"[9, 9]","Another classic that doesn't really get the attention it deserves. This is a fun movie, a summer movie. Matt Dillon plays Jeff, a young kid who has just started his last summer before college. His dad wants him to work in an office for the summer but he wants to work at an upscale beach resort called The Flamingo. He grew up in lower class Brooklyn, but his job takes him to the ritzy shores of Long Island where he is quickly making money, moving up the ladder and making solid connections with the wealthy. His friendship with Mr. Brody (The King) begins to change Jeff's ideas about his future, much to the dismay of Jeff's father. Surrounded by wealthy people all day long, Jeff begins to dream of following in Mr. Brody's footsteps and becoming a sports car salesman. When Jeff finds out that Mr. Brody is just a cheater filled with a lot of hot air he takes him on in a marathon game of Gin. This is a great coming of age story and Matt Dillon is perfect in the role. All of the acting is great, it looks beautiful and is an easy movie to watch. The moral of the story for me: don't be fooled by those who preach the easy life, life is more rewarding when you take the hard road.",5,Summer Flies By,1215388800,"07 7, 2008",2008,1187,"['classic', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'attention', 'fun', 'movie', 'summer', 'movie', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Jeff', 'young', 'kid', 'who', 'just', 'started', 'last', 'summer', 'college', 'dad', 'work', 'office', 'summer', 'work', 'upscale', 'beach', 'resort', 'called', 'Flamingo', 'grew', 'up', 'lower', 'class', 'Brooklyn', 'job', 'ritzy', 'shores', 'Long', 'Island', 'where', 'quickly', 'making', 'money', 'moving', 'up', 'ladder', 'making', 'solid', 'connections', 'wealthy', 'friendship', 'Mr.', 'Brody', 'King', 'change', 'Jeff', 'ideas', 'future', 'much', 'dismay', 'Jeff', 'father', 'Surrounded', 'wealthy', 'people', 'day', 'long', 'Jeff', 'dream', 'following', 'Mr.', 'Brody', 'footsteps', 'becoming', 'sports', 'car', 'salesman', 'When', 'Jeff', 'out', 'Mr.', 'Brody', 'just', 'cheater', 'filled', 'lot', 'hot', 'air', 'marathon', 'game', 'Gin', 'great', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'perfect', 'role', 'acting', 'great', 'beautiful', 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'moral', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'who', 'preach', 'easy', 'life', 'life', 'more', 'rewarding', 'when', 'take', 'hard', 'road']",N/A

Penny Marshall.  This film showed that he could translate his skill from the small screen to the big screen.  And it is written by Garry and Neal Marshall, what a talented family!In 50's New York City, if you have made it you live in Manhattan, if not, you live in Brooklyn.  Jeffrey Willis is the son of a plumber (Hector Elizando) and lives in Brooklyn.  He has graduated from High School and is the first in his family to go to college.  This is his last summer before becoming a true adult.  His father has arranged a summer office job but he wants a summer of fun.  He gets a job as a cabana boy at the prestigious El Flamingo Beach Club.Next to sun and surf, the main diversion is gin rummy.  Jeff just happens to be a wiz at gin.  He quickly catches the attention of Phil Brody, the club cardsharp. But things don't sit as well when he catches the eye Phil's daughter (Carole R Davis).  In the end, Jeff decides to go to college.The 50's was the last decade of innocence.  This film captures this spirit.  While the boys talk a good game, they seldom got anywhere with the girls.  Marshall keeps the film on the right note for high drama to light comedy.While some may say that this was a star studded cast only Matt Dillon had a solid movie background.  Richard Crenna was a TV star from 50's and 60's.  The remaining cast had TV notoriety but would gain their fame later - Hector Elizondo (Chicago Hope) and Jessica Walters (Arrested Development).  Even Dillon's success didn't happen until this film and later.This is a great film to watch when you want to see the end of innocence in America.",4,From Small Screen to Big Screen,1135209600,"12 22, 2005",2005,1714,"['Garry', 'Marshall', 'was', 'noted', 'two', 'things', 'great', 'sitcom', 'director', 'big', 'brother', 'Laverne', 'DeFazio', 'a.k.a', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'film', 'showed', 'could', 'translate', 'skill', 'small', 'screen', 'big', 'screen', 'written', 'Garry', 'Neal', 'Marshall', 'what', 'talented', 'family', '50', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'have', 'made', 'live', 'Manhattan', 'not', 'live', 'Brooklyn', 'Jeffrey', 'Willis', 'son', 'plumber', 'Hector', 'Elizando', 'Brooklyn', 'graduated', 'High', 'School', 'first', 'family', 'go', 'college', 'last', 'summer', 'becoming', 'true', 'adult', 'father', 'arranged', 'summer', 'office', 'job', 'summer', 'fun', 'job', 'cabana', 'boy', 'prestigious', 'El', 'Flamingo', 'Beach', 'Club.Next', 'sun', 'surf', 'main', 'diversion', 'gin', 'rummy', 'Jeff', 'just', 'be', 'wiz', 'gin', 'quickly', 'attention', 'Phil', 'Brody', 'club', 'cardsharp', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'sit', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'eye', 'Phil', 'daughter', 'Carole', 'R', 'Davis', 'end', 'Jeff', 'go', 'college.The', '50', 'was', 'last', 'decade', 'innocence', 'film', 'spirit', 'boys', 'talk', 'good', 'game', 'seldom', 'got', 'anywhere', 'girls', 'Marshall', 'film', 'right', 'note', 'high', 'drama', 'light', 'comedy.While', 'may', 'say', 'was', 'star', 'studded', 'cast', 'only', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'had', 'solid', 'movie', 'background', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'was', 'TV', 'star', '50', '60', 'remaining', 'cast', 'had', 'TV', 'notoriety', 'would', 'gain', 'fame', 'later', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'Chicago', 'Hope', 'Jessica', 'Walters', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'Even', 'Dillon', 'success', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'film', 'later.This', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'when', 'want', 'see', 'end', 'innocence', 'America']",N/A
756125,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B00009OWJS,Randy Keehn,"[3, 4]","""The Flamingo Kid"" turned out to be a real ""sleeper"" for me.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end and most everything in between.  This is a ""feel good"" movie that gives us a young man looking to make his start in the world.  His rich buddies introduce him to a Rockaway (NY) resort where he is offered a job.  His father had other ideas and their ensuing relationship is one of the major focusses of the film.  In the meantime there are a variety of characters and events that keep the movie moving along.  In the end, our hero, Matt Dillon, learns a lot of valuable lessons in life.I think of TV when I think of the director Gary Marshall.  His hit series ""Happy Days"" has to be measured along with the questionable ""Laverne and Shirley"".  I found ""The Flamingo Kids"" to be a professionally done movie.  Perhaps a little more lightly done than some but certainly comparable to the film-making of its' time.

756127,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00009OWJS,Wuchak,"[5, 5]","At first glance, 1984's ""The Flamingo Kid"" looks like a coming-of-age beach flick. What occasionally attracts me to these types of films is their youthful energy and fun spirit, as well as the babes. It brings one back in time to the carefree time of his/her coming-of-age years. What surprised me is that ""The Flamingo Kid"" is more than just a youth beach flick.The story takes place in the early 60s where 18-year-old Matt Dillon, a plumber's son from Brooklyn, gets a summer job at a private beach club. This was his final summer of carefree fun before going off to college, but his experiences at the beach club change his plans. He makes loads of money on tips, meets a beautiful blond and becomes fascintated by a new mentor, fast-talking businessman and cardshark Richard Crenna.Crenna convinces Dillon that there are easier, faster (i.e. dishonest) ways to make loads of money than going off to college for years on end. When Dillon moves out of his house and cancels his college plans it naturally creates some serious friction with his father. Will Dillon go on to become the next generation's fast-talking businessman/cardshark in the mold of Crenna or will he see the error of such an enticing lifestyle?Almost the entire film was shot on location at an Atantic beach club with loads of gorgeous females on hand, including Dillon's girlfriend in the story, Janet Jones. Cutie Marisa Tomei even has a cameo.The bottom line is that ""The Flamingo Kid"" offers everything you'd want in such a film and more, including a truly interesting story in which you care about the outcome. And, thankfully, there's NO RAUNCH. In addition the soundtrack includes numerous early 60's hits like ""Runaround Sue,"" etc. What's not to like?Runtime: 100 minutesPERSONAL GRADE: A-",5,Matt Dillon's summer as a cabana boy at a private beach club,1231804800,"01 13, 2009",2009,1769,"['first', 'glance', '1984', 'Flamingo', 'Kid', 'coming-of-age', 'beach', 'flick', 'What', 'occasionally', 'types', 'films', 'youthful', 'energy', 'fun', 'spirit', 'as', 'well', 'babes', 'one', 'back', 'time', 'carefree', 'time', 'his/her', 'coming-of-age', 'years', 'What', 'surprised', 'Flamingo', 'Kid', 'more', 'just', 'youth', 'beach', 'flick.The', 'story', 'place', 'early', '60s', 'where', '18-year-old', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'plumber', 'son', 'Brooklyn', 'summer', 'job', 'private', 'beach', 'club', 'was', 'final', 'summer', 'carefree', 'fun', 'going', 'off', 'college', 'experiences', 'beach', 'club', 'change', 'plans', 'loads', 'money', 'tips', 'beautiful', 'blond', 'becomes', 'fascintated', 'new', 'mentor', 'fast-talking', 'businessman', 'cardshark', 'Richard', 'Crenna.Crenna', 'Dillon', 'are', 'easier', 'faster', 'i.e', 'dishonest', 'ways', 'make', 'loads', 'money', 'going', 'off', 'college', 'years', 'end', 'When', 'Dillon', 'house', 'cancels', 'college', 'plans', 'naturally', 'serious', 'friction', 'father', 'Will', 'Dillon', 'go', 'become', 'next', 'generation', 'fast-talking', 'businessman/cardshark', 'mold', 'Crenna', 'will', 'see', 'error', 'such', 'enticing', 'lifestyle', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'Atantic', 'beach', 'club', 'loads', 'gorgeous', 'females', 'hand', 'including', 'Dillon', 'girlfriend', 'story', 'Janet', 'Jones', 'Cutie', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'even', 'cameo.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'Flamingo', 'Kid', 'everything', ""'d"", 'want', 'such', 'film', 'more', 'including', 'truly', 'interesting', 'story', 'care', 'outcome', 'thankfully', 'RAUNCH', 'addition', 'soundtrack', 'numerous', 'early', '60', 'hits', 'Runaround', 'Sue', 'etc', 'What', 'not', 'like', 'Runtime', '100', 'minutesPERSONAL', 'GRADE', 'A-']",N/A
