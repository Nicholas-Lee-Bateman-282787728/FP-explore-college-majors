Certainly not a sci-fi junkie as myself. As others have remarked the character dynamics and concept (bounty hunters in space) is not radically unlike that of Firefly. And while I find Firefly overrated, it is still a great show. If you're looking for more of the same sort of vibe this is a great one to pick up, and the price is definitely right.Ok, so the show is predictable and some of the dialog cardboard, but by and large there are some interesting ideas explored in this show which is Canada's answer to Blake's 7.As for the DVD, well, you get what you pay for. The audio and video are pretty sub-par. It's unfortunate because some of the effects are done rather well and would make for enticing eye-candy.At any rate, if you're a sci-fi/space opera fan (like I am), you can pick this up for a song and decide whether it's worth the investment to check out the second season, which I hear has much better production values, both in the show and the DVD set.",3,"A good, looooow budget sci-fi show.",1139184000,"02 6, 2006",2006,1075,"['saw', 'store', 'one', 'day', 'picked', 'up', 'Volumes', '1', '2', '10', 'bucks', 'so', 'who', 'could', 'pass', 'up', 'Certainly', 'not', 'sci-fi', 'junkie', 'myself', 'others', 'have', 'remarked', 'character', 'dynamics', 'concept', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'space', 'not', 'radically', 'Firefly', 'find', 'Firefly', 'overrated', 'still', 'great', 'show', ""'re"", 'looking', 'more', 'same', 'sort', 'vibe', 'great', 'one', 'pick', 'up', 'price', 'definitely', 'right.Ok', 'show', 'predictable', 'dialog', 'cardboard', 'large', 'are', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'explored', 'show', 'Canada', 'answer', 'Blake', '7.As', 'DVD', 'well', 'get', 'what', 'pay', 'audio', 'video', 'are', 'pretty', 'sub-par', 'unfortunate', 'effects', 'are', 'done', 'rather', 'well', 'would', 'make', 'enticing', 'eye-candy.At', 'rate', ""'re"", 'sci-fi/space', 'opera', 'fan', 'am', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'song', 'decide', 'investment', 'check', 'out', 'second', 'season', 'hear', 'much', 'better', 'production', 'values', 'show', 'DVD', 'set']",N/A

I think this show came first which makes me question the integrity of Joss Whedon. He basically co-opted the entire idea for his famous Firefly show (which I also enjoy) from this show, but has never mentioned it or given it credit (that I've heard of). So he's dumb. But whatevs, this show is weird and cool.",4,Firefly?

I was a bit unsure at first, but I was really involved by the end and hated to see it end.  The characters developed very well and the story line was pretty good.Definitely a low budget affair and some of the writing a bit amateurish, but the cast and crew really seemed to give it a go and won me over.  The whole here is greater than the sum of its parts.If you like Sci-fi along the lines of Firefly, you should enjoy this.  In fact, I found many things here that seemed to have been payed homage in the Firefly series itself.  I won't spoil your fun, but they're pretty clear.  Firefly had much better scripts, but this series has heart.  Money well spent and good enough that I will enjoy watching many times over.2012-03-10 I still find myself intrigued by this series and coming back to it from time to time. There's a touch of ""magic"" in this production, clearly a lot of the people involved put their heart into what they were doing.",4,Gets better as you go...,1198800000,"12 28, 2007",2007,1008,"['pretty', 'good', 'Sci-Fi', 'series', 'better', 'better', 'was', 'bit', 'unsure', 'first', 'was', 'really', 'involved', 'end', 'hated', 'see', 'end', 'characters', 'developed', 'very', 'well', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'pretty', 'good.Definitely', 'low', 'budget', 'affair', 'writing', 'bit', 'amateurish', 'cast', 'crew', 'really', 'seemed', 'give', 'go', 'won', 'whole', 'here', 'greater', 'sum', 'parts.If', 'Sci-fi', 'lines', 'Firefly', 'should', 'enjoy', 'fact', 'found', 'many', 'things', 'here', 'that', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'payed', 'homage', 'Firefly', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'fun', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'clear', 'Firefly', 'had', 'much', 'better', 'scripts', 'series', 'heart', 'Money', 'well', 'spent', 'good', 'enough', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'many', 'times', 'over.2012-03-10', 'still', 'find', 'intrigued', 'series', 'coming', 'back', 'time', 'time', 'touch', 'magic', 'production', 'clearly', 'lot', 'people', 'involved', 'put', 'heart', 'what', 'were', 'doing']",N/A
857444,A34XSKN7R0R74N,B00062IZ2M,David Wilson,"[18, 20]","I bought this DVD because I like Michael Pare.  He'll never win any awards for acting, but I like him anyway.  This was obviously a very low budget show, at least by science fiction standards.  Sometimes the sets are so simple it's quite funny.  The low budget carried over to the production of the DVDs, apparently.  There are 8 episodes squeezed onto a single DVD, and the compression really shows.  The scene will periodically ""shimmer"" with heavy pixelation.  (There's a reason why virtually all TV series available on DVD put no more than 4 ""hour"" shows on each disc.)  If you've seen Michael Pare before and like him, and are prepared for the marginal quality of the DVD, the episodes are entertaining.  Just don't expect a really slick production like Firefly.",3,"Entertaining, but very low budget",1121558400,"07 17, 2005",2005,767,"['bought', 'DVD', 'like', 'Michael', 'Pare', ""'ll"", 'never', 'win', 'awards', 'acting', 'like', 'anyway', 'was', 'obviously', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'show', 'least', 'science', 'fiction', 'standards', 'Sometimes', 'sets', 'are', 'so', 'simple', 'quite', 'funny', 'low', 'budget', 'carried', 'production', 'DVDs', 'apparently', 'are', '8', 'episodes', 'squeezed', 'single', 'DVD', 'compression', 'really', 'scene', 'will', 'periodically', 'shimmer', 'heavy', 'pixelation', 'reason', 'why', 'virtually', 'TV', 'series', 'available', 'DVD', 'put', 'more', '4', 'hour', 'shows', 'disc', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Michael', 'Pare', 'are', 'prepared', 'marginal', 'quality', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'are', 'entertaining', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'really', 'slick', 'production', 'Firefly']",N/A

I was also annoyed that one show, FamilyValues, was missing from this disk as it was only the thirdshow aired and it should have been here.But aside from that, I am pleased to have Starhunter on DVDfree and uncut since the local station that carried it on TVhad cut out so much just to allow for more commercials.
