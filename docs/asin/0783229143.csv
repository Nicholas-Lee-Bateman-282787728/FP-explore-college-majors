61419,A1YVPBDG2OFMD2,0783229143,Leif Sheppard,"[1, 2]","As a director of music video clips, Russell Mulcahy is something of a living legend. Aside from directing the first video MTV ever aired (back when they did that sort of thing), he also helmed the clips for acts like The Rolling Stones, Elton John, Queen, Billy Joel, and a myriad of other artists. It may take a handful of film class periods to wholly examine his prolific work in the eighties.As a film director, however, his work is much more difficult to digest.RicochetandResident Evil: Extinctionare able actioners, but his only real classic isHighlander. Needless to say, it's classic of the most cultish variety, which was probably inevitable considering lead Christopher Lambert is as wooden an actor as a totem pole. I won't even get into wild misfires likeThe Shadowor low budget television tripe likeThe Curse of King Tut's Tomb. It's a tall order to get excited about a director that foists that sort of work on an unsuspecting public.It was quite a surprise, then, to find that ""The Real McCoy"" stands among some of Mulcahy's best film work. The plotting follows a rather formulaic heist tale, which also requires serious suspension of disbelief on the part of the audience as we're supposed to believe Kim Basinger is some sort of master thief. Val Kilmer portrays an amiable yet inept robber while the great Terence Stamp is sadly wasted as the local crime boss. He's essentially playing the same role Ben Gazzara did inRoad House, except Englishman Stamp was forced to adopt a horrific Southern American accent for his role.Despite a predictable plot and somewhat dubious casting, ""The Real McCoy"" is an entirely enjoyable heist film in the same vein asThe Score. Granted, neither are particularly memorable, yet they make for ample entertainment on a rainy afternoon. Highlights include Kilmer's singularly hilarious botched convenience store robbery and the intricate, if entirely implausible, bank heist at the climax of the film.In summation, if you're able to believe Basinger as a world-class thief who handles with equal aplomb both air compressed second-story apparati and complex computer wizardry, you may enjoy this film. If you can accept that Terence Stamp is attempting to effect some kind of Southern American accent and has absolutely no room within the script to even pretend to act, you may enjoy this film. If you can stomach a vastly dated, ear-grating score that was composed almost entirely on a mid-eighties era synthesizer, you will almost certainly enjoy this film.",4,Inessential yet Unoffensive Heist Yarn,1253923200,"09 26, 2009",2009,2507,"['director', 'music', 'video', 'clips', 'Russell', 'Mulcahy', 'something', 'living', 'legend', 'Aside', 'directing', 'first', 'video', 'MTV', 'ever', 'aired', 'back', 'when', 'did', 'sort', 'thing', 'also', 'helmed', 'clips', 'acts', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Elton', 'John', 'Queen', 'Billy', 'Joel', 'myriad', 'other', 'artists', 'may', 'take', 'handful', 'film', 'class', 'periods', 'wholly', 'examine', 'prolific', 'work', 'eighties.As', 'film', 'director', 'however', 'work', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'digest.RicochetandResident', 'Evil', 'Extinctionare', 'able', 'actioners', 'only', 'real', 'classic', 'isHighlander', 'Needless', 'say', 'classic', 'most', 'cultish', 'variety', 'was', 'probably', 'inevitable', 'considering', 'lead', 'Christopher', 'Lambert', 'wooden', 'actor', 'totem', 'pole', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'wild', 'misfires', 'likeThe', 'Shadowor', 'low', 'budget', 'television', 'likeThe', 'Curse', 'King', 'Tut', 'Tomb', 'tall', 'order', 'get', 'excited', 'director', 'sort', 'work', 'unsuspecting', 'public.It', 'was', 'quite', 'surprise', 'then', 'find', 'Real', 'McCoy', 'Mulcahy', 'best', 'film', 'work', 'plotting', 'rather', 'formulaic', 'heist', 'tale', 'also', 'serious', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'part', 'audience', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'sort', 'master', 'thief', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'amiable', 'yet', 'inept', 'robber', 'great', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'sadly', 'wasted', 'local', 'crime', 'boss', 'essentially', 'playing', 'same', 'role', 'Ben', 'Gazzara', 'did', 'inRoad', 'House', 'Englishman', 'Stamp', 'was', 'forced', 'adopt', 'horrific', 'Southern', 'American', 'accent', 'role.Despite', 'predictable', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'dubious', 'casting', 'Real', 'McCoy', 'entirely', 'enjoyable', 'heist', 'film', 'same', 'vein', 'asThe', 'Score', 'Granted', 'are', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'yet', 'make', 'ample', 'entertainment', 'rainy', 'afternoon', 'Highlights', 'include', 'Kilmer', 'singularly', 'hilarious', 'botched', 'convenience', 'store', 'robbery', 'intricate', 'entirely', 'implausible', 'bank', 'heist', 'climax', 'film.In', 'summation', ""'re"", 'able', 'believe', 'Basinger', 'world-class', 'thief', 'who', 'equal', 'aplomb', 'air', 'compressed', 'second-story', 'apparati', 'complex', 'computer', 'wizardry', 'may', 'enjoy', 'film', 'can', 'accept', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'attempting', 'effect', 'kind', 'Southern', 'American', 'accent', 'absolutely', 'room', 'script', 'even', 'pretend', 'act', 'may', 'enjoy', 'film', 'can', 'stomach', 'vastly', 'dated', 'ear-grating', 'score', 'was', 'composed', 'almost', 'entirely', 'mid-eighties', 'era', 'synthesizer', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'film']",N/A

A lovely woman and a competent actress, it is her presence that makes THE REAL MCCOY a tolerable bank heist yarn.  Basinger plays a slick bank robber who gets out on parole after serving six years of a ten year sentence.  Her smarmy husband (an obnoxious Nick Searcy) has told their young son that his mother is dead, but Basinger is determined to have some kind of relationship with the boy.  She hooks up with Val Kilmer who plays a fan of hers and who also entices her to do a bank heist for creepy Terence Stamp.  Seems that Stamp is the culprit responsible for Basinger's imprisonment, so she doesn't want to have anything to do with him.  But Stamp has other plans and kidnaps the son to force her to do the heist.  Basinger does well with the conflicting maternal instincts, telling young Patrick that she is a friend of his deceased mommy.  The heist itself is staged well by director Russell Mulcahy, but the end result is fairly obvious and even though Basinger has plans of her own, we find ourselves hoping she, Kilmer and the boy come out on top.Mindless entertainment, but certainly not a dog.",3,BANKER'S HOURS,1132617600,"11 22, 2005",2005,1146,"['always', 'nice', 'see', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'A', 'lovely', 'woman', 'competent', 'actress', 'presence', 'REAL', 'MCCOY', 'tolerable', 'bank', 'heist', 'yarn', 'Basinger', 'slick', 'bank', 'robber', 'who', 'out', 'parole', 'serving', 'six', 'years', 'ten', 'year', 'sentence', 'smarmy', 'husband', 'obnoxious', 'Nick', 'Searcy', 'told', 'young', 'son', 'mother', 'dead', 'Basinger', 'determined', 'have', 'kind', 'relationship', 'boy', 'up', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'who', 'fan', 'hers', 'who', 'also', 'do', 'bank', 'heist', 'creepy', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'Stamp', 'culprit', 'responsible', 'Basinger', 'imprisonment', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'Stamp', 'other', 'plans', 'kidnaps', 'son', 'force', 'do', 'heist', 'Basinger', 'well', 'conflicting', 'maternal', 'instincts', 'telling', 'young', 'Patrick', 'friend', 'deceased', 'mommy', 'heist', 'staged', 'well', 'director', 'Russell', 'Mulcahy', 'end', 'result', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'even', 'Basinger', 'plans', 'own', 'find', 'hoping', 'Kilmer', 'boy', 'come', 'out', 'top.Mindless', 'entertainment', 'certainly', 'not', 'dog']",N/A

61424,A2X25C107CSLOR,0783229143,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[7, 9]","Director Russell Mulcahy's action heist doesn't reveal as much bank theft hardware as Jon Amiel's 1999 Entrapment, nor allows for the star power that Catherine Zeta-Jones and Sean Connery provided for the later film. As the protagonist, a reknown bank robber out on parole after 6 years in a Georgia jail (which allows for her accent) and blackmailed into doing another bank, Kim Basinger is limited by the genre's stereotype of a woman in an action movie and the mysogynistic screenplay by William Davies and William Osborne. We know things are off when Mulcahy doesn't give Basinger the coverage to confirm the Who is That? response of Val Kilmer as someone vaguely connected to her parole officer and a rookie criminal. Basinger's self-conscious beauty is seen to attract constant sexual harassment by men far less appealing than her - just note the repeated &quot;you've kept your figure&quot; observation -  but then Mulcahy has a queasy scene where she is beaten and offers no self defence when she has already demonstrated she possesses some skill in that area. Why? Does Basinger being so beautiful mean she must pay for it? When she is first released from prison a man comes on to her on a train, but he is inexplicably repelled when she tells him she robs bank. There is also an implication that she is a bad mother for abandoning her child in favour of a life of crime. We're never told why she started robbing banks, though considering what her ex-husband is like, it may have been just to get away from her life with him, if you can believe she would have ever been interested in him in the first place. Mulcahy doesn't have the comic skill to give Basinger in a black wig any payoff (though Basinger in a black wig is still recognisably Kim), and he even scores points off her by having her not wear gloves when she breaks into someone's house. We get the hackneyed stalled car when the driver is in pursuit, rain during the bank heist, and a very MTV image of someone pouring a bottle of water over their face, which can only be partly contextualised by the apparent heat of the vault drilling and the matching sweat on Basinger's face. Mulcahy cleverly provides cross cuts to security police racing to the bank during the heist to create suspense, since the mechanics of the heist itself are lacking in detail, but Kilmer's timing of the security route from their base to the bank is merely an excuse for an extended stunt driving sequence. Kilmer doesn't make much of an impression here, and doesn't even get to touch Basinger, but Terence Stamp as the head of the bad guys gets a good yell in closeup.",3,there was only man for the job: a woman,997228800,"08 8, 2001",2001,2619,"['Director', 'Russell', 'Mulcahy', 'action', 'heist', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'much', 'bank', 'theft', 'hardware', 'Jon', 'Amiel', '1999', 'Entrapment', 'star', 'power', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'provided', 'later', 'film', 'protagonist', 'reknown', 'bank', 'robber', 'out', 'parole', '6', 'years', 'Georgia', 'jail', 'accent', 'blackmailed', 'doing', 'bank', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'limited', 'genre', 'stereotype', 'woman', 'action', 'movie', 'mysogynistic', 'screenplay', 'William', 'Davies', 'William', 'Osborne', 'know', 'things', 'are', 'when', 'Mulcahy', ""n't"", 'give', 'Basinger', 'coverage', 'confirm', 'Who', 'response', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'someone', 'vaguely', 'connected', 'parole', 'officer', 'rookie', 'criminal', 'Basinger', 'self-conscious', 'beauty', 'seen', 'attract', 'constant', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'men', 'far', 'less', 'appealing', 'just', 'note', 'repeated', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'kept', 'figure', 'quot', 'observation', 'then', 'Mulcahy', 'queasy', 'scene', 'where', 'beaten', 'self', 'defence', 'when', 'already', 'demonstrated', 'skill', 'area', 'Why', 'Basinger', 'being', 'so', 'beautiful', 'mean', 'must', 'pay', 'When', 'first', 'released', 'prison', 'man', 'train', 'inexplicably', 'repelled', 'when', 'robs', 'bank', 'also', 'implication', 'bad', 'mother', 'abandoning', 'child', 'favour', 'life', 'crime', ""'re"", 'never', 'told', 'why', 'started', 'robbing', 'banks', 'considering', 'what', 'ex-husband', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'get', 'away', 'life', 'can', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'interested', 'first', 'place', 'Mulcahy', ""n't"", 'have', 'comic', 'skill', 'give', 'Basinger', 'black', 'wig', 'payoff', 'Basinger', 'black', 'wig', 'still', 'recognisably', 'Kim', 'even', 'points', 'having', 'not', 'wear', 'gloves', 'when', 'someone', 'house', 'get', 'hackneyed', 'stalled', 'car', 'when', 'driver', 'pursuit', 'rain', 'bank', 'heist', 'very', 'MTV', 'image', 'someone', 'pouring', 'bottle', 'water', 'face', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'partly', 'contextualised', 'apparent', 'heat', 'vault', 'drilling', 'matching', 'sweat', 'Basinger', 'face', 'Mulcahy', 'cleverly', 'cross', 'cuts', 'security', 'police', 'racing', 'bank', 'heist', 'create', 'suspense', 'mechanics', 'heist', 'are', 'lacking', 'detail', 'Kilmer', 'timing', 'security', 'route', 'base', 'bank', 'merely', 'excuse', 'extended', 'stunt', 'driving', 'sequence', 'Kilmer', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'impression', 'here', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'touch', 'Basinger', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'head', 'bad', 'guys', 'good', 'yell', 'closeup']",N/A
61425,A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q,0783229143,Priscilla Stafford,"[13, 14]","Kim Basinger plays Karen McCoy, a solo bank robber who gets caught one night while 'on the job'. After six years she's out on parole and rushes to see her beloved son, Patrick (Zach English). Much to her dismay and anger, she finds out that not only had her ex-husband Roy (Nick Searcy) been burning her letters to her son, he also told Patrick that his mother was dead! Karen must now work to make her life 'straight' as she tries to get custody to see her kid. But things start to get worse when former boss and gangster Jack Schmidt (Terrence Stamp) kidnaps her son and blackmails her to do one last bank heist. With the help of rookie criminal J.T. Barker (Val Kilmer), Karen must make sure she can get her son and herself out of this mess alive.The idea is good, the cast is good, it's such a shame that &quot;The Real McCoy&quot; turns out to be a mediocre film floundering in a badly written script. Once again, I will say that the whole idea behind the movie is great, what if a ex-bank robber is blackmailed and must pull the most elaborate and difficult bank robbery? Unfortunately, whoever wrote the script had either no clue how to fill out the story or was in a rush to get it finished. The movie begins with Karen getting caught then we are brought to six years after the event. The next 40 minutes are dull as we are dragged through events that really didn't have to happen. Finally though, after trudging through the first 50 minutes, we get to see some action. The bank robbery is well done and loads of fun, up there with the first &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; movie. But after the climax bank heist, the ending feels a bit cut short. In my opinion, the first 40 minutes could have been compressed into half the time, then lengthened the ending by adding some more twists and turns.Then we have the acting. Some of the reviewers complained about Kim Basinger. All I can say is that I feel very bad for her. I bet her character was really hard to act out since the director/writer duo couldn't seem to make up what kind of person they wanted! Did they want a frail woman to be pitied upon because of her constant clashes with overbearing males? Or did they want a strong woman with plenty of smarts to be able to be an expert robber? Karen McCoy has too many mixed up personalities to be able to really like, though Kim Basinger at times gives a good performance. Terrence Stamp is just completely wasted on, there's nothing special about his bad-guy role. On the good side, we have the young and talented actor Val Kilmer as Karen's sidekick. I've always thought of him as a very versatile actor, I mean he's acted out so many different roles (a spy in &quot;The Saint&quot;, a superhero in &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, a warrior in &quot;Willow&quot;, a legend in &quot;Tombstone&quot;, etc.). Seeing him play J.T. Barker was a lot fun, backwards baseball cap, Southern accent, and all! He got all the best lines in the film and played his role with the greatest of ease. It's too bad we didn't get to see more of him.There are some great action scenes, including of course the climax bank heist. Val Kilmer gets to drive a VERY cool car (can't really see if it's a Camarro or a Firebird since they were very similar looking cars). Though it's kind of weird to hear screeching tires in the pouring rain, for car lovers it's absolutely wonderful to hear the car's nice engine!So, here's a summary: It's too bad the script couldn't have been worked out better since we have three such great stars acting in the movie.

61426,A2DXWPSRCS9ETF,0783229143,"sleeping sheepsnake ""Seth""","[1, 2]","I was at work today, and when I mentioned to a friend that I had watched a boring movie called The Real McCoy the night before, starring Kim Basinger and Val Kilmer, he told me he had watched Crank.  Apparently I should have watched Crank, based on what he said.  As far as The Real McCoy goes, I explained that it was a pity that Val Kilmer's character started out as kind of interesting, in a comical way, but then seemed to have no personality about halfway through the film.  My friend said ""Isn't that always the case with Val Kilmer?  Heh heh."".  Joking, maybe, but I didn't feel that was fair.  I said: ""What about The Doors?""; Friend: ""Oh yaahhhhh! That was a great movie!"".  I said: ""What about The Salton Sea?""; Friend"" ""Oh yaaahhhhhhh! That was a great movie!."".So, The Real McCoy is not just a Val Kilmer problem.  Halfway through the film, everything shuts down.  It's like the film stops all forward momentum, but just keeps going forward anyway.  Kilmer simply becomes completely irrelevant to the proceedings, like he's just following Basinger around while she connects a few dots to get to the end credits.This is a heist picture--a complex bank heist, to be precise.  The complex bank heist is clever, but it requires very little action, just some nifty gadgets, and some repetitous rannygazoo to fake out the cops while the real quasi-action goes down.  The thieves even bring along snacks and a thermos of coffee to keep them tided over during the heist--they've got that kind of time.Before the heist is the human-interest stuff.  Freshly-paroled heistmaster Karen McCoy (Kim Basinger) just wants to connect with her young son, who is being kept out of her reach by her estranged hubbie, who told the kid she was dead.  She's saddled with a sweaty, lecherous parole officer who wants favours for allowing her her continued freedom.  Then there's J. T. Barker (Val Kilmer) who recognizes her and starts trailing her around like a lovesick guppy, until she finally decides she needs him to help her get her son back--NOT from her ex-husband anymore, but from a crimeboss she blames for her jail-time, who wants her to pull off one last score, a hit on the Atlanta Union Bank (which seems to have a sign more suitable to a strip-joint).  Enter the heist.Basinger looks great; besides the lecherous parole officer she's the only thing to really generate any kind of emotional reaction in me (opposite reactions).  The action scenes are few and far between.  The plot has no delightful zigzags or jolts that get you interested in the scene you're watching, or the one to come.  I find it hard to believe that this is the same director of Ricochet, with Denzel Washington, which is no classic, but plays mind-games, and doles out some gritty action.  The Real McCoy makes several promises in the first half hour and then decides it doesn't have to keep any of them: no suspense, no romance, no real pyrotechnics during the heist, and to top it all off, a big tiger that obviously doesn't know what to do with an appetizing-looking bad guy.  Some of the music by Brad Fiedel--of Terminator fame--is cool, and Kilmer has some fun at  the start, but the movie is entirely too relaxed to function as a thriller.  And I can't call it a successful comedy, romance, or family drama, by any stretch, so we're rut-snagged.  My friend's twenty-second description of Crank was more involving than this pillow disguised as a movie.",2,The Real McCoy,1172448000,"02 26, 2007",2007,3434,"['was', 'work', 'today', 'when', 'mentioned', 'friend', 'had', 'watched', 'boring', 'movie', 'called', 'Real', 'McCoy', 'night', 'starring', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'told', 'had', 'watched', 'Crank', 'Apparently', 'should', 'have', 'watched', 'Crank', 'based', 'what', 'said', 'As', 'far', 'Real', 'McCoy', 'explained', 'was', 'pity', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'character', 'started', 'out', 'kind', 'interesting', 'comical', 'way', 'then', 'seemed', 'have', 'personality', 'halfway', 'film', 'friend', 'said', ""n't"", 'always', 'case', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Heh', 'heh.', 'Joking', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'fair', 'said', 'What', 'Doors', 'Friend', 'Oh', 'yaahhhhh', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'said', 'What', 'Salton', 'Sea', 'Friend', 'Oh', 'yaaahhhhhhh', 'was', 'great', 'movie', '.So', 'Real', 'McCoy', 'not', 'just', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'problem', 'Halfway', 'film', 'everything', 'shuts', 'down', 'film', 'forward', 'momentum', 'just', 'keeps', 'going', 'forward', 'anyway', 'Kilmer', 'simply', 'completely', 'irrelevant', 'proceedings', 'just', 'following', 'Basinger', 'few', 'dots', 'get', 'end', 'credits.This', 'heist', 'picture', 'complex', 'bank', 'heist', 'be', 'precise', 'complex', 'bank', 'heist', 'clever', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'just', 'nifty', 'gadgets', 'repetitous', 'rannygazoo', 'fake', 'out', 'cops', 'real', 'quasi-action', 'down', 'thieves', 'even', 'bring', 'along', 'snacks', 'thermos', 'coffee', 'keep', 'tided', 'heist', ""'ve"", 'got', 'kind', 'time.Before', 'heist', 'human-interest', 'stuff', 'Freshly-paroled', 'heistmaster', 'Karen', 'McCoy', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'just', 'connect', 'young', 'son', 'who', 'being', 'kept', 'reach', 'estranged', 'hubbie', 'who', 'told', 'kid', 'was', 'dead', 'saddled', 'sweaty', 'lecherous', 'parole', 'officer', 'who', 'favours', 'allowing', 'continued', 'freedom', 'Then', 'J.', 'T.', 'Barker', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'who', 'trailing', 'lovesick', 'guppy', 'finally', 'help', 'get', 'son', 'back', 'NOT', 'ex-husband', 'anymore', 'crimeboss', 'jail-time', 'who', 'pull', 'off', 'one', 'last', 'score', 'hit', 'Atlanta', 'Union', 'Bank', 'have', 'sign', 'more', 'suitable', 'strip-joint', 'Enter', 'heist.Basinger', 'great', 'lecherous', 'parole', 'officer', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'generate', 'kind', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'opposite', 'reactions', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'plot', 'delightful', 'zigzags', 'jolts', 'get', 'interested', 'scene', ""'re"", 'watching', 'one', 'come', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'same', 'director', 'Ricochet', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'classic', 'mind-games', 'out', 'gritty', 'action', 'Real', 'McCoy', 'several', 'promises', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'then', ""n't"", 'have', 'keep', 'suspense', 'romance', 'real', 'pyrotechnics', 'heist', 'top', 'off', 'big', 'tiger', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'appetizing-looking', 'bad', 'guy', 'music', 'Brad', 'Fiedel', 'Terminator', 'fame', 'cool', 'Kilmer', 'fun', 'start', 'movie', 'entirely', 'too', 'relaxed', 'function', 'thriller', 'ca', ""n't"", 'call', 'successful', 'comedy', 'romance', 'family', 'drama', 'stretch', ""'re"", 'rut-snagged', 'friend', 'twenty-second', 'description', 'Crank', 'was', 'more', 'involving', 'pillow', 'disguised', 'movie']",N/A
