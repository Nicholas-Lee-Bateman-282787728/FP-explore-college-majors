918603,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000A1OFYG,Brian E. Erland,"[12, 14]","Shot in the Tuscan mountains of Spain, director Giovanni Veronesi has created a decidedly strange and rather quirky western which continually vacillates between wholesome family entertainment and dark, surreal Tarantinoesque depravity.Famous gunfighter Johnny Lowen (Harvey Keitel) decides to hang-up his sixshooter and return to the home and family he left some twenty years ago. In his absence his wife has died and his son (Leonardo Pieracconi) has grown-up and is now the town Doctor. Doc is married to a beautiful Indian maiden, Pearl (Sandrine Holt) and has a young half-breed son, Jeremiah (Yudii Mercredi).Retirement doesn't come easy for Johnny. Jack Sikora (David Bowie), another notorious and reportedly psycho outlaw is on his trail. Jack is determined to kill Johnny, thereby securing for himself the reputation of ""fastest gun."" Johnny's refusal to strap on his sixshooter angers Jack and his gang. They try to change his mind by taking their hostilities out on the townspeople. As the violence escalates it becomes clear that someone will have to face Sikora sooner or later. Who will it be?A delightfully ecclectic and oddball supporting cast. There's Joshua (Jim van der Woude) the town fool who lives on Doc's roof, crowing like a rooster at sunrise and hooting like an owl through the night. Then there's the very sexy Mary (Alessia Marcuzzi), saloon owner and resident whore who delights the young Jeremiah with her outdoor showers.However it's Jack Sikora and his seedy entourage that steal the show. There's Rastafarian (Kwame Kwei-Armah) and Albino (Stephan Jenn) two of the most unsavory individuals you'll ever lay your eyes on as Sikora's bodyguards, while Leathergirl (Michelle Gomez) photographs the nefarious deeds of their leader for posterity. Then of course there's David Bowie with his chronologically inappropriate sunglasses and peacock attire posing with delight after every killing.Definitely not your standard run-of-the-mill western.

918607,A60PQSFWSQK8K,B000A1OFYG,Erik Rupp,"[2, 3]","Gunslinger's Revenge is an Italian made Western featuring Harvey Keitel and David Bowie.  Now, if that's not enough to make you go, ""Hmmmmm...now THAT sounds interesting,"" nothing will.While the idea of Keitel and Bowie in a modern day Spaghetti Western sounds like a real hoot of a movie - lots of action and great dialogue - what the filmmakers delivered was a charming, touching movie instead.  Sure, there are bits here and there that are inappropriate for kids under 14 or 15, but on the whole this really is a family movie at heart.  And that's unusual for a Spaghetti Western.  But, then again, Spaghetti Westerns pretty much died out 30 years ago, so this is really a new generation's take on the Spaghetti Western.  (Clearly, this isn't a Leone Spaghetti Western.  It isn't even a Corbucci Spaghetti Western in style, either.)Keitel plays a well known gunfighter named Johnny Lowen, who has returned to the town he grew up in, and reunites with his son (whom he had abandoned 20 years earlier).  His son is an avowed pacifict and the town doctor, which creates even more tension between them.  To make matters infinitely worse, psychopathic gunslinger/killer Jack Sikora (Bowie) comes to town looking to put an end to the growing legend of Johnny Lowen and to build his own legend up in the process.  This is where some of the more unpleasant and (mildly) graphic parts of the movie occur.Sikora is almost amoral in his willingness to kill, but he has a mean streak to go along with his inability to feel right or wrong.The conclusion seems to work for some, but not for others.  For me it came across as an honest, realistic ending.  All the loose ends are tied up, but not in a forced way.Gunslinger's Revenge is not without flaws (some of the dialouge is poor - not a lot, but some - some of the events feel a bit rushed, and some of the plot is a bit predictable), but on the whole it is a solid modern take on the Western, and fits in with some of the more recent Westerns that have been released (it's not all that far removed from the tone of Open Range, but as a film it's just not as good).In the end, if your expectations are right (don't expect a great movie) then you'll likely find Gunslinger's Revenge to be an entertaining and touching Western.",4,3 1/2 Stars - Spaghetti Western Circa 1998,1204934400,"03 8, 2008",2008,2268,"['Gunslinger', 'Revenge', 'Italian', 'made', 'Western', 'featuring', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Now', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'go', 'Hmmmmm', 'now', 'interesting', 'nothing', 'idea', 'Keitel', 'Bowie', 'modern', 'day', 'Spaghetti', 'Western', 'real', 'hoot', 'movie', 'lots', 'action', 'great', 'dialogue', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'delivered', 'was', 'charming', 'touching', 'movie', 'instead', 'Sure', 'are', 'bits', 'here', 'there', 'are', 'inappropriate', 'kids', '14', '15', 'whole', 'really', 'family', 'movie', 'heart', 'unusual', 'Spaghetti', 'Western', 'then', 'again', 'Spaghetti', 'Westerns', 'pretty', 'much', 'died', 'out', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'really', 'new', 'generation', 'take', 'Spaghetti', 'Western', 'Clearly', ""n't"", 'Leone', 'Spaghetti', 'Western', ""n't"", 'even', 'Corbucci', 'Spaghetti', 'Western', 'style', 'either', 'Keitel', 'well', 'known', 'gunfighter', 'named', 'Johnny', 'Lowen', 'who', 'returned', 'town', 'grew', 'up', 'son', 'whom', 'had', 'abandoned', '20', 'years', 'earlier', 'son', 'avowed', 'pacifict', 'town', 'doctor', 'even', 'more', 'tension', 'make', 'matters', 'infinitely', 'worse', 'psychopathic', 'gunslinger/killer', 'Jack', 'Sikora', 'Bowie', 'town', 'looking', 'put', 'end', 'growing', 'legend', 'Johnny', 'Lowen', 'build', 'own', 'legend', 'up', 'process', 'where', 'more', 'unpleasant', 'mildly', 'graphic', 'parts', 'movie', 'occur.Sikora', 'almost', 'amoral', 'willingness', 'kill', 'mean', 'streak', 'go', 'along', 'inability', 'feel', 'right', 'wrong.The', 'conclusion', 'work', 'not', 'others', 'came', 'across', 'honest', 'realistic', 'ending', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'not', 'forced', 'way.Gunslinger', 'Revenge', 'not', 'flaws', 'dialouge', 'poor', 'not', 'lot', 'events', 'feel', 'bit', 'rushed', 'plot', 'bit', 'predictable', 'whole', 'solid', 'modern', 'take', 'Western', 'fits', 'more', 'recent', 'Westerns', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'not', 'far', 'removed', 'tone', 'Open', 'Range', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', '.In', 'end', 'expectations', 'are', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'great', 'movie', 'then', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'find', 'Gunslinger', 'Revenge', 'be', 'entertaining', 'touching', 'Western']",Gunslinger's Revenge
