It is set in the late 1960's which is when I was in high school/college, so seeing the styles and hearing the music of that period is a kick.  The fact that the younger Sergeant Bacchus is the bigot and the older Inspector Gently is the &#34;cool&#34; guy is a nice twist.  Gently's character is generally the thoughtful, kind policeman, but he can kick a-- when needed.  He is trying to get his sergeant to grow up and be a better man, but it is difficult.  What woman can resist the romantic hero dealing with having lost the love of his life, but not giving up on his life or his job.

George Gently Series episodes are based on selections of the 46 Gently novels by Alan Hunter. Episodes are feature-length, and can serve as stand alone stories. No need to watch them back-to-back in a hurry. A really good 1960s period crime show with excellent plot writing. An acclaimed BBC hit.All season/episodes come with SDH SUBTITLE optionSeason 1:  This first series shows the beginning, when Commander Gently's wife is killed right before his eyes. Even through his grief, the cop takes the high road in finding criminals and bringing them to justice. The 3 episodes in this series are very much like ""Midsomer Murders"".- - - 2: Four feature-length episodes, each 89 minutes, & each serve as great stand-alone crime mystery films tied together only by a 1964 date. Gently has not given up fighting crime of all sorts and is now Chief Inspector in the extremely beautiful north countryside.- - - 3: Gently, played by Martin Shaw, is through, calm, and plays the mentor/father to his youthful assistant, Detective Sargent John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby). Their relationship is as important to the story/series as the crimes and investigations. Both are performance perfect. Bacchus provides some laughs. 2 episodes.- - - 4: PC Taylor (Simon Hubbard) is also back for both episodes. An emotional crime series, mystery, suspenseful, fast moving, and packed with plot. A perfect personality bounce between DCI Gently and Sgt Bacchus, with comedy spice.

1634199,A28YDMI499J1X9,B00BEZEDNU,J. Janssen,"[1, 1]","PBS has been broadcasting George Gently for years and all of these episodes are probably familiar to most viewers.  What sets this collection apart is it's price compared to the individual series of the first 4 seasons.  BBC home video products are almost always priced higher than other UK productions, usually averaging $10 to $15 per episode.  In this compilation the US street price comes to about $5 an episode for the same product as in the individual series.As usual Martin Shaw brings the title character to life with his portrayal of the iconoclastic Chief Inspector.  And, as usual, many will find DS Bacchus irritating as the bagman who never seems to learn any lessons. After a while you just get used to him, but it's curious that they never explained just what Gently originally saw in this guy.  Every episode has it's share of ""Bacchus issues"".  He's not the brightest bulb in the box, is only marginally loyal, and is more than a little iffy when temptation comes a knockin'.  He's supposed to intimidate suspects but comes across as the one most likely to get the cheese beaten out of him in a confrontation. Lee Ingleby is a fine actor but I think he was miscast as Bacchus. Other than this curious lapse  the writing is excellent and is based on the stories and characters created in the Alan Hunter novels.Set in the 1960's and beautifully filmed, each episode captures the areas in and around  Northumberland* in a manner that enhances the overall theme of individuals struggling during a period of significant social change.  While there is no particular political agenda on display a number of the episodes deal with issues that seem to disturb certain viewers, no doubt stemming from the sometimes violent class struggle affecting post WWII Britain. Labor conflicts, in particular, were much more contentious than in the US as the UK went from work houses to unionized factories seemingly overnight. These themes come from the Hunter novels and, if anything, the films tend to downplay any controversial material. But be forewarned, if you're the sort of person that likes to believe racism, homosexuality, child abuse, and abortion politics never existed in jolly old England, this might not be your cup of tea. The series is fairly limited as there's only 11 episodes spread over 4 seasons, due in part to Shaw working on the Judge Deed series at the same time.  That might change as Judge Deed has come to an end and perhaps Shaw will devote more time to Gently in the future.All in all an excellent production that borders on the dark and somber which may not suit all tastes.  It's not a fluff piece about Carnaby St., Twiggy, pop music or any other 60's ephemera, but the writing and cinematography are first rate and the entire series has a cognitive narrative as opposed to just a collection of random episodes.  Additionally, the time period correctness is spot on as the fashions, music and cars accurately track an era of rapid social change. The only negative for some might be an over reliance on flashbacks and, more recently, cliff-hangers, as a dramatic device. One star off for the annoying Bacchus, but overall an excellent series.*  The early episodes were filmed in Ireland as it was deemed  better suited to portray 1960's Northumberland. They subsequently relocated production to Durham during the later seasons.",4,Gentler price this time around,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,3359,"['PBS', 'been', 'broadcasting', 'George', 'Gently', 'years', 'episodes', 'are', 'probably', 'familiar', 'most', 'viewers', 'What', 'collection', 'apart', 'price', 'compared', 'individual', 'series', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'BBC', 'home', 'video', 'products', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'priced', 'higher', 'other', 'UK', 'productions', 'usually', 'averaging', '10', '15', 'episode', 'compilation', 'US', 'street', 'price', '5', 'episode', 'same', 'product', 'individual', 'series.As', 'usual', 'Martin', 'Shaw', 'title', 'character', 'life', 'portrayal', 'iconoclastic', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'usual', 'many', 'will', 'find', 'DS', 'Bacchus', 'irritating', 'bagman', 'who', 'never', 'learn', 'lessons', 'while', 'just', 'get', 'used', 'curious', 'never', 'explained', 'just', 'what', 'Gently', 'originally', 'saw', 'guy', 'episode', 'share', 'Bacchus', 'issues', 'not', 'brightest', 'bulb', 'box', 'only', 'marginally', 'loyal', 'more', 'little', 'iffy', 'when', 'temptation', 'knockin', 'supposed', 'intimidate', 'suspects', 'across', 'one', 'most', 'likely', 'get', 'cheese', 'beaten', 'confrontation', 'Lee', 'Ingleby', 'fine', 'actor', 'think', 'was', 'miscast', 'Bacchus', 'Other', 'curious', 'writing', 'excellent', 'based', 'stories', 'characters', 'created', 'Alan', 'Hunter', 'novels.Set', '1960', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'episode', 'areas', 'Northumberland*', 'manner', 'overall', 'theme', 'individuals', 'struggling', 'period', 'significant', 'social', 'change', 'particular', 'political', 'agenda', 'display', 'number', 'episodes', 'deal', 'issues', 'seem', 'disturb', 'certain', 'viewers', 'doubt', 'stemming', 'sometimes', 'violent', 'class', 'struggle', 'affecting', 'post', 'WWII', 'Britain', 'Labor', 'conflicts', 'particular', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'contentious', 'US', 'UK', 'went', 'work', 'houses', 'unionized', 'factories', 'seemingly', 'overnight', 'themes', 'come', 'Hunter', 'novels', 'anything', 'films', 'tend', 'downplay', 'controversial', 'material', 'be', 'forewarned', ""'re"", 'sort', 'person', 'believe', 'racism', 'homosexuality', 'child', 'abuse', 'abortion', 'politics', 'never', 'existed', 'jolly', 'old', 'England', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'cup', 'tea', 'series', 'fairly', 'limited', 'only', '11', 'episodes', 'spread', '4', 'seasons', 'due', 'part', 'Shaw', 'working', 'Judge', 'Deed', 'series', 'same', 'time', 'might', 'change', 'Judge', 'Deed', 'come', 'end', 'perhaps', 'Shaw', 'will', 'devote', 'more', 'time', 'Gently', 'future.All', 'excellent', 'production', 'borders', 'dark', 'somber', 'may', 'not', 'suit', 'tastes', 'not', 'fluff', 'piece', 'Carnaby', 'St.', 'Twiggy', 'pop', 'music', 'other', '60', 'ephemera', 'writing', 'cinematography', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'entire', 'series', 'cognitive', 'narrative', 'opposed', 'just', 'collection', 'random', 'episodes', 'Additionally', 'time', 'period', 'correctness', 'spot', 'fashions', 'music', 'cars', 'accurately', 'track', 'era', 'rapid', 'social', 'change', 'only', 'negative', 'might', 'be', 'over', 'reliance', 'flashbacks', 'more', 'recently', 'cliff-hangers', 'dramatic', 'device', 'One', 'star', 'annoying', 'Bacchus', 'excellent', 'series', '*', 'early', 'episodes', 'were', 'filmed', 'Ireland', 'was', 'deemed', 'better', 'suited', 'portray', '1960', 'Northumberland', 'subsequently', 'relocated', 'production', 'Durham', 'later', 'seasons']",GEORGE GENTLY COLLECTION: SERIES 1-4

Martin Shaw does a fabulous job in his role and really makes the show come to life. This box set takes you through the first four seasons. The show starts off his a bang when Gently watches his wife die right in front of his eyes.  He has to overcome his grief and track down the killers and bring them to justice.  Like many detective series, there are some episodes that are stand alone murder mysteries and others that are part of the larger storyline. Being able to watch them all back to back was great because I wasn't left hanging...well at least not until I reached the end of Season Four.  Each episode  offers its own unique and suspenseful storyline. It is set in 1960's Britain, and the costumes and scenery really bring to life this classic era. Getting all four seasons in this one set is an amazing deal!

1634209,A258D5KI1UFE63,B00BEZEDNU,RVN SF,"[7, 11]","Where in the item description does it say that there are only 11 episodes selected by Acorn Media? Are we supposed to know that since there are 11 CDs there are only 11 episodes? Even the outside of the packaging does not reveal how few episodes await within.I found out about this series on YouTube and purchased this &#8220;collection&#8221; to fill in the gaps created by missing episodes on YouTube. What a disappointment to me when I discovered all the missing episodes on these CDs. In addition, Acorn Media denies you complete control over the the CD&#8217;s contents. On the 1st, I could not skip their advertisements for all the other wonderful British series they offer (but probably only selected episodes.) The only way to skip to a point where you left-off is to increase the speed from 1X to 8X and race forward until you recognize the scene where you had paused watching. There is no comprehensive menu either.So, I believe that the description is misleading and constitutes false advertising. Do not buy this and perhaps other Acorn Media series unless you are sure of the actual contents you are purchasing. It would be much better if Amazon could offer all the episodes in this series at their normally reasonable prices. I have no understanding of the huge number of rave reviews. I too think that this is a magnificent series, but it is hard to rave when you have been screwed. I will now try and return this purchase to Amazon.",1,RIP-OFF - ONLY 11 SELECTED EPISODES FROM 4 SEASONS AS OPPOSED TO 9 TO 14 PER SEASON,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,1448,"['Where', 'item', 'description', 'say', 'are', 'only', '11', 'episodes', 'selected', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'Are', 'supposed', 'know', 'are', '11', 'CDs', 'are', 'only', '11', 'episodes', 'Even', 'outside', 'packaging', 'not', 'reveal', 'how', 'few', 'episodes', 'await', 'within.I', 'found', 'out', 'series', 'YouTube', 'purchased', '8220', 'collection', '8221', 'fill', 'gaps', 'created', 'missing', 'episodes', 'YouTube', 'What', 'disappointment', 'when', 'discovered', 'missing', 'episodes', 'CDs', 'addition', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'complete', 'control', 'CD', '8217', 's', 'contents', '1st', 'could', 'not', 'skip', 'advertisements', 'other', 'wonderful', 'British', 'series', 'offer', 'probably', 'only', 'selected', 'episodes', 'only', 'way', 'skip', 'point', 'where', 'left-off', 'increase', 'speed', '1X', '8X', 'race', 'forward', 'recognize', 'scene', 'where', 'had', 'paused', 'watching', 'comprehensive', 'menu', 'either.So', 'believe', 'description', 'misleading', 'constitutes', 'false', 'advertising', 'Do', 'not', 'buy', 'perhaps', 'other', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'series', 'are', 'sure', 'actual', 'contents', 'are', 'purchasing', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'Amazon', 'could', 'offer', 'episodes', 'series', 'normally', 'reasonable', 'prices', 'have', 'understanding', 'huge', 'number', 'rave', 'reviews', 'too', 'think', 'magnificent', 'series', 'hard', 'rave', 'when', 'have', 'been', 'screwed', 'will', 'now', 'try', 'return', 'purchase', 'Amazon']",GEORGE GENTLY COLLECTION: SERIES 1-4
