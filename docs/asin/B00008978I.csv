736067,A3T69POTR8R107,B00008978I,"Arch Llewellyn ""arch-l""","[10, 13]","What a strange little movie. First: Willem Dafoe as T.S. Eliot. Way too physical and intense, too New York, to make a convincing Eliot. At 39, he's too old for the young Eliot at the beginning and too young for the weary wartime Eliot we see at the end. Yet stick with it, the pacing and intonation (carefully cribbed from recordings of Eliot's readings) gain power over time. By the end I almost believed. But not quite!Next: Miranda (""Viv"") Richardson. The movie can't seem to make up its mind about her. A brilliant woman eclipsed by her husband's fame? A free spirit suffocated by Eliot's need for a stodgy English life? Victim of an undiagnosed hormonal imbalance? Of a patriarchal society where the Lunacy Act and the male trustees her father leaves her fortune to (Eliot and her brother, as it happens) conspire to lock her up?  A high-strung eccentric (chocolate in the mail slot) or stark raving mad? The movie flirts with all these options without really digging into any one of them.Eliot too appears alternately as a duped lover, loving caretaker, and cold-hearted ogre who locks his wife away when she threatens to hurt his career. The upshot is that you never know these two at all. Why they fall in love, why they keep insisting they're in love through a sterile marriage, what makes either of them brilliant, what each needed in the other--we're told without ever really being shown. Blame it on the narrator, Viv's brother, whose reminiscences formed the basis of the play this movie's based on. Off to the war and then to Africa, conservative and cheerily philistine about what makes England England, he's not the best person to get inside a literary couple like Tom & Viv. The upshot? A middle-of-the-road period piece that trots out a series of clich&eacute;s without showing much interest in getting beyond the surface of this brilliant, tragic couple.",3,Etherized,1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,1873,"['What', 'strange', 'little', 'movie', 'First', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'T.S', 'Eliot', 'Way', 'too', 'physical', 'intense', 'too', 'New', 'York', 'make', 'convincing', 'Eliot', '39', 'too', 'old', 'young', 'Eliot', 'beginning', 'too', 'young', 'weary', 'wartime', 'Eliot', 'see', 'end', 'stick', 'pacing', 'intonation', 'carefully', 'cribbed', 'recordings', 'Eliot', 'readings', 'gain', 'power', 'time', 'end', 'almost', 'believed', 'not', 'quite', 'Next', 'Miranda', 'Viv', 'Richardson', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'brilliant', 'woman', 'eclipsed', 'husband', 'fame', 'free', 'spirit', 'suffocated', 'Eliot', 'need', 'stodgy', 'English', 'life', 'Victim', 'undiagnosed', 'hormonal', 'imbalance', 'patriarchal', 'society', 'where', 'Lunacy', 'Act', 'male', 'father', 'fortune', 'Eliot', 'brother', 'conspire', 'lock', 'up', 'high-strung', 'eccentric', 'chocolate', 'mail', 'slot', 'stark', 'raving', 'mad', 'movie', 'options', 'really', 'digging', 'one', 'them.Eliot', 'too', 'alternately', 'duped', 'lover', 'loving', 'caretaker', 'cold-hearted', 'ogre', 'who', 'wife', 'away', 'when', 'hurt', 'career', 'upshot', 'never', 'know', 'two', 'Why', 'fall', 'love', 'why', 'keep', 'insisting', ""'re"", 'love', 'sterile', 'marriage', 'what', 'brilliant', 'what', 'needed', 'other', ""'re"", 'told', 'ever', 'really', 'being', 'shown', 'Blame', 'narrator', 'Viv', 'brother', 'reminiscences', 'formed', 'basis', 'play', 'movie', 'based', 'Off', 'war', 'then', 'Africa', 'conservative', 'cheerily', 'philistine', 'what', 'England', 'England', 'not', 'best', 'person', 'get', 'literary', 'couple', 'Tom', 'Viv', 'upshot', 'middle-of-the-road', 'period', 'piece', 'out', 'series', 'clich', 'eacute', 'showing', 'much', 'interest', 'getting', 'surface', 'brilliant', 'tragic', 'couple']",N/A
736068,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,B00008978I,Dai-keag-ity,"[2, 5]","With a sound cast headed by Miranda Richardson and Willem Dafoe, Tom & Viv is a good film about a spirited woman dealt an unfair hand in life, and the selfish man she married. It's also a slightly shocking film for portions of its subject matter, including some parts that might make certain male audience members squirm.The story itself really made me dislike T.S. Eliot: and for once it was for more than just his---I think---bad poetry. This film tells what was once only whispered among Eliot scholars and was later forgotten, that being Eliot's unforgivably callous treatment of his decidedly hormonally unbalanced first wife, Viv. True, the ""mercurial"" and foul-mouthed proto-Flapper Vivienne Eliot was no doubt a trial for someone like the choleric Tom to bear, in fact they were a mismatched pair from the start, but for a man to lock his wife away for the duration of her remaining life, including for years long past the time there was any medical need for it (assuming there ever was)...it takes a cold being to be capable of that.Never having been a fan of Eliot's work, I don't know enough about the details of the marriage at the heart of this story to comment on any errors this movie contained, but if it is reflective of the actual fate of Mrs. Eliot, then it's something people ought to know about the man whose playful little jottings gave us the musical Cats as well as those (IMHO) painfully awful pieces endemic in college textbooks, Murder in the Cathedral, and The Waste Land.Good performances and a worthy revelation about a literary icon's heartlessness in his private life, but ultimately only three and a half stars, primarily for the fact that the script as written wasn't able to fully sustain the story at its final length.",3,The Dark Side Of T.S.

736070,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B00008978I,Gregor von Kallahann,"[8, 10]","Watching TOM & VIV is an exercise in frustration.  In fact, it reminded me of all that's suspect about film biographies.  Too sketchy on the one hand, and taking too many liberties with the facts on the other.  (Those may be interrelated problems, come to think of it, both stemming from the near impossibility of compressing a whole life into two hours.)  Every once in a while, something like KINSEY comes along that tells its tale in an original and fairly comprehensive way.  But this 1994 release is not of that order.In fact the nagging sensation that I got from viewing TOM & VIV was that I was really taking the lazy man's way out.  I didn't know much about T.S. Eliot's life before. And I didn't learn a heck of a lot from this movie either.  I don't know about you, but when a fact-based movie leaves me feeling that way, I tend to feel cheated.  You may not always know if there's a superior book or other source material out there (this movie is based on a play, which may or may not have actually been better), but a movie like this makes you feel like you need to do a whole lot more research before you can even talk about such key issues as: whether or not it's accurate; whether or not it's fair;  whether or not it even begins to approach the truth of its subjects' lives.Miranda Richardson and (in a surprisingly understated way) Willem Dafoe try their level best to bring depth to their underwritten parts.  The film wants to be somewhat fair, and while many viewers (see some of the critiques below) will probably come away thinking that Eliot was a ""monster,"" it is apparent that the film is actually trying for a somewhat more nuanced view.  A bit of a cad, certainly a prig--and an artist who fled from emotion rather than embracing it.  But did he cruelly institutionalize his mentally unstable wife and deliberately keep her there even after it became clear that she was suffering more from hormonal imbalance rather than insanity?  Or was he simply acting out of the same ignorance as all her doctors and, for that matter, her family?  Since he did not act alone in these matters, it hardly seems fair to single him out for vilification.Or maybe it does.  But we need more facts, s'il vous plait. And maybe a better narrative would help.  Apparently, there was some difficulty getting the estate's permission to quote extensively from Eliot's actual poetry.  The one or two examples of same are riveting and suggestive of what this movie could have been had it focused more on the artist's art--and if it had given us a glimpse or two more of the nature of the Eliots' actual collaboration.  Vivienne is described as his muse and his best reader, but that's the problem.  She's DESCRIBED.  We don't see much of their supposed collaboration (well, there is a scene where they're reviewing proofs of THE WASTELAND) and wind up pretty much having to take the characters' word for it.There were moments when I was reminded of another film about a genius who married badly and whose wife wound up in an asylum.  Ken Russell's MUSIC LOVERS covered much of the same ground.  And while many found Russell's film wildly uneven, it had panache and a kind of reckless energy that a more staid, solmemn piece like TOM & VIV could benefit from.When all is said and done, the film leaves you wondering which is worse: the moral failings of artists or the artistic failings of moralists.",3,We Are the Hollow Filmmakers...,1129248000,"10 14, 2005",2005,3399,"['Watching', 'TOM', 'VIV', 'exercise', 'frustration', 'fact', 'reminded', 'suspect', 'film', 'biographies', 'Too', 'sketchy', 'one', 'hand', 'taking', 'too', 'many', 'liberties', 'facts', 'other', 'may', 'be', 'interrelated', 'problems', 'come', 'think', 'stemming', 'near', 'impossibility', 'compressing', 'whole', 'life', 'two', 'hours', 'once', 'while', 'something', 'KINSEY', 'tale', 'original', 'fairly', 'comprehensive', 'way', '1994', 'release', 'not', 'order.In', 'fact', 'nagging', 'sensation', 'got', 'viewing', 'TOM', 'VIV', 'was', 'was', 'really', 'taking', 'lazy', 'man', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'T.S', 'Eliot', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'learn', 'heck', 'lot', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'fact-based', 'movie', 'feeling', 'way', 'tend', 'feel', 'cheated', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'know', 'superior', 'book', 'other', 'source', 'material', 'there', 'movie', 'based', 'play', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'feel', 'need', 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'research', 'can', 'even', 'talk', 'such', 'key', 'issues', 'not', 'accurate', 'not', 'fair', 'not', 'even', 'approach', 'truth', 'subjects', 'lives.Miranda', 'Richardson', 'surprisingly', 'understated', 'way', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'try', 'level', 'best', 'bring', 'depth', 'underwritten', 'parts', 'film', 'be', 'somewhat', 'fair', 'many', 'viewers', 'see', 'critiques', 'will', 'probably', 'come', 'away', 'thinking', 'Eliot', 'was', 'monster', 'apparent', 'film', 'actually', 'trying', 'somewhat', 'more', 'nuanced', 'view', 'bit', 'cad', 'certainly', 'prig', 'artist', 'who', 'fled', 'emotion', 'rather', 'embracing', 'did', 'cruelly', 'institutionalize', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'wife', 'deliberately', 'keep', 'even', 'became', 'clear', 'was', 'suffering', 'more', 'hormonal', 'imbalance', 'rather', 'insanity', 'was', 'simply', 'acting', 'same', 'ignorance', 'doctors', 'matter', 'family', 'did', 'not', 'act', 'alone', 'matters', 'hardly', 'fair', 'single', 'out', 'vilification.Or', 'maybe', 'need', 'more', 'facts', ""s'il"", 'vous', 'plait', 'maybe', 'better', 'narrative', 'would', 'help', 'Apparently', 'was', 'difficulty', 'getting', 'estate', 'permission', 'quote', 'extensively', 'Eliot', 'actual', 'poetry', 'one', 'two', 'examples', 'same', 'are', 'riveting', 'suggestive', 'what', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'focused', 'more', 'artist', 'art', 'had', 'given', 'glimpse', 'two', 'more', 'nature', 'Eliots', 'actual', 'collaboration', 'Vivienne', 'described', 'muse', 'best', 'reader', 'problem', 'DESCRIBED', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'supposed', 'collaboration', 'well', 'scene', 'where', ""'re"", 'reviewing', 'proofs', 'THE', 'WASTELAND', 'wind', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'having', 'take', 'characters', 'word', 'it.There', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'was', 'reminded', 'film', 'genius', 'who', 'married', 'badly', 'wife', 'wound', 'up', 'asylum', 'Ken', 'Russell', 'MUSIC', 'LOVERS', 'covered', 'much', 'same', 'ground', 'many', 'found', 'Russell', 'film', 'wildly', 'uneven', 'had', 'panache', 'kind', 'reckless', 'energy', 'more', 'staid', 'solmemn', 'piece', 'TOM', 'VIV', 'could', 'benefit', 'from.When', 'said', 'done', 'film', 'wondering', 'worse', 'moral', 'failings', 'artists', 'artistic', 'failings', 'moralists']",N/A
736071,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B00008978I,"Promise ""promise""","[0, 0]","I read Eliot's poetry in college and liked it a lot, but knew very little of his personal life.  So I was very interested in this film.  From reading some of the comments from people who knew more of the facts of Eliot's life, this film doesn't seem to shed much real light.  We get some facts--he was an American Anglophile who met and quickly married a wealthy Englishwoman.  It seemed to be a perfect case of opposites attracting and then repelling.  He was more English than the King and she wanted to be free of the constraints of her culture. We first see her kicking up her heels and throwing caution to the wind. She romanticized being poor and criticized him for taking a sensible job in a bank. He becomes more and more straight-laced, spends a considerable ammount of time with the Anglican bishop and eventually joins the church...while Viv creates scenes wherever she goes and even pulls a knife on Virginia Woolf in a taxi.The film is confusing in that we don't really know what Vivienne's problem was.  At first it seems that the problem was physical--she had irregular periods.  But then it became evident that her mood swings were much worse than that problem would account for.  The film is a Rorshack test for viewers' attitudes;  some believe that Viv was just a high-spirited, brilliant girl who was thwarted by Eliot's stuffiness.  Some call Eliot an outright monster who married her for her money and drained her life away.  I saw a different picture--that of a long-suffering man who seemed to be deeply in love with a genuinely mentally ill woman and who put up with her outrageous behavior for many years before finally consenting to have her hospitalized.  This decision was made jointly with her mother and brother, and at the recommendation of her doctors. I was reminded of Lincoln, another long suffering man who loved and put up with a very difficult wife.The last part, showing Viv in the mental hospital where she seemed perfectly sane and looked  wonderfully healthy, was confusing. Had she only been suffering from an undiagnosed hormonal imbalance and was she then receiving treatment for it?  Is that why she seemed well?  If she had been genuinely cured, why didn't anyone bother to release her?  Eliot was back in the US and her brother was in Africa but weren't they in communication?  It's hard to believe that the whole family just dumped her in this hospital and forgot about her.The character of the mother is shown in a confusing way, too.  For most of the film she is very sympathetic to Eliot.  Then there is a dramatic scene in which she blames him for wrecking Viv's life and her own.  Rosemary Harris is sublime, as usual, but even she doesn't make this credible.  I had to wonder, too, why the family didn't intervene in Viv's illness much earlier and just seemed content to let Eliot bear the whole burden of caring for her.The ending tries to say that, in spite of their separation that they each harbored a deep love for the other.  It's a nice try but wasn't really believable.In a way the film seems exploitative---taking the tragic events of a well-known man, bringing them to the world but not in a way that offers any clarity or light. It left me depressed and I think Eliot would have hated it.",3,Interesting but confusing,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,3255,"['read', 'Eliot', 'poetry', 'college', 'liked', 'lot', 'knew', 'very', 'little', 'personal', 'life', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'film', 'reading', 'comments', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'more', 'facts', 'Eliot', 'life', 'film', ""n't"", 'seem', 'shed', 'much', 'real', 'light', 'get', 'facts', 'was', 'American', 'Anglophile', 'who', 'met', 'quickly', 'married', 'wealthy', 'Englishwoman', 'seemed', 'be', 'perfect', 'case', 'opposites', 'attracting', 'then', 'repelling', 'was', 'more', 'English', 'King', 'wanted', 'be', 'free', 'constraints', 'culture', 'first', 'see', 'kicking', 'up', 'heels', 'throwing', 'caution', 'wind', 'romanticized', 'being', 'poor', 'criticized', 'taking', 'sensible', 'job', 'bank', 'more', 'more', 'straight-laced', 'considerable', 'ammount', 'time', 'Anglican', 'bishop', 'eventually', 'church', 'Viv', 'scenes', 'even', 'knife', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'taxi.The', 'film', 'confusing', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'Vivienne', 'problem', 'was', 'first', 'problem', 'was', 'physical', 'had', 'irregular', 'periods', 'then', 'became', 'evident', 'mood', 'swings', 'were', 'much', 'worse', 'problem', 'would', 'account', 'film', 'Rorshack', 'test', 'viewers', 'attitudes', 'believe', 'Viv', 'was', 'just', 'high-spirited', 'brilliant', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'thwarted', 'Eliot', 'stuffiness', 'call', 'Eliot', 'outright', 'monster', 'who', 'married', 'money', 'drained', 'life', 'away', 'saw', 'different', 'picture', 'long-suffering', 'man', 'who', 'seemed', 'be', 'deeply', 'love', 'genuinely', 'mentally', 'ill', 'woman', 'who', 'put', 'up', 'outrageous', 'behavior', 'many', 'years', 'finally', 'consenting', 'have', 'hospitalized', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'jointly', 'mother', 'brother', 'recommendation', 'doctors', 'was', 'reminded', 'Lincoln', 'long', 'suffering', 'man', 'who', 'loved', 'put', 'up', 'very', 'difficult', 'wife.The', 'last', 'part', 'showing', 'Viv', 'mental', 'hospital', 'where', 'seemed', 'perfectly', 'sane', 'looked', 'wonderfully', 'healthy', 'was', 'confusing', 'Had', 'only', 'been', 'suffering', 'undiagnosed', 'hormonal', 'imbalance', 'was', 'then', 'receiving', 'treatment', 'why', 'seemed', 'well', 'had', 'been', 'genuinely', 'cured', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'bother', 'release', 'Eliot', 'was', 'back', 'US', 'brother', 'was', 'Africa', 'were', ""n't"", 'communication', 'hard', 'believe', 'whole', 'family', 'just', 'dumped', 'hospital', 'forgot', 'her.The', 'character', 'mother', 'shown', 'confusing', 'way', 'too', 'most', 'film', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'Eliot', 'Then', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'wrecking', 'Viv', 'life', 'own', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'sublime', 'usual', 'even', ""n't"", 'make', 'credible', 'had', 'wonder', 'too', 'why', 'family', 'did', ""n't"", 'intervene', 'Viv', 'illness', 'much', 'earlier', 'just', 'seemed', 'content', 'let', 'Eliot', 'bear', 'whole', 'burden', 'caring', 'her.The', 'ending', 'tries', 'say', 'spite', 'separation', 'harbored', 'deep', 'love', 'other', 'nice', 'try', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'believable.In', 'way', 'film', 'exploitative', '-taking', 'tragic', 'events', 'well-known', 'man', 'bringing', 'world', 'not', 'way', 'clarity', 'light', 'left', 'depressed', 'think', 'Eliot', 'would', 'have', 'hated']",N/A

But what does the American moviegoing public, especially in the nineties, care for the life and marriage of a poet? For Tom and Viv are T. S. Eliot (Willem Dafoe, once again ignored by the Academy) and his mentally unstable wife Vivienne (Miranda Richardson, who did get a nomination for Best Actress).The plot is simple and straightforward: American expatriate Tom, who according to the narration of Vivienne's brother Maurice (Tim Dutton) is trying to out-English the English, finds everything he's looking for in England in the person of Vivienne: she's upperclass, moneyed, a member of the British society, but with a wild, untameable streak. He falls in love and they elope, realizing only after they're married that Vivienne isn't just high-spirited, she's quite mentally unsound. Thus, Tom is brought in under the wing of Vivienne's family, made one of them by proxy, and much of the film alternates between Tom's attempts to handle Viv's erratic behavior and him commiserating with various family members. Finally, with everyone at the end of their collective rope, Tom and Maurice come up with a plan that will satisfy everyone except Vivienne herself.This is a film that plays itself very close to the vest. It's staid, almost glacial on the surface, but simmers beneath with rage and despair. Dafoe and Richardson are both brilliant in their roles, and make an essentially plotless biopic into gripping viewing.

Eliot, (""The Wasteland,"" ""The Four Quartets"") and Miranda Richardson as his unfortunate wife Vivienne Haigh-Wood, opens on the Oxford school days of the poet -- who was initially from St. Louis.  We find him studying with Lord Bertrand Russell, well-known anti-war philosopher: another of Russell's students is Vivienne's brother, upon whose memories this film is based.  It was filmed on location, around Oxford and London, and garnered two Oscar nominations, plus two other awards.Tom and Viv elope, and it's basically all downhill from there: she has gynecological and emotional problems that disrupt even the honeymoon.  Dafoe does the best he can with a part that's not written on the page: Richardson turns in one of her trademark manic performances.  Rosemary Harris almost carries the picture as Viv's worried mum. We meet, briefly, the celebrated early 20th century literary group that centered around Bloomsbury, London-- Virginia Woolf and company.  We get the obligatory slow Oxford river boating scenes, but the story stays slow, and doesn't really go anywhere.  The sound's often bad, and the film's confusing.  It raises the issue of why Eliot behaves as he did; and though you can't insist that a movie should do so, it doesn't answer the questions it's raised.  It's the kind of movie, unfortunately, that gives art films a bad name.",3,Arty Schmarty,1188777600,"09 3, 2007",2007,1473,"['Tom', 'Viv', '1994', 'Miramax', 'biopic', 'starring', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'world-famous', '20th', 'century', 'anglophile', 'American', 'poet', 'T.S', 'Eliot', 'Wasteland', 'Four', 'Quartets', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'unfortunate', 'wife', 'Vivienne', 'Haigh-Wood', 'Oxford', 'school', 'days', 'poet', 'who', 'was', 'initially', 'St.', 'Louis', 'find', 'studying', 'Lord', 'Bertrand', 'Russell', 'well-known', 'anti-war', 'philosopher', 'Russell', 'students', 'Vivienne', 'brother', 'memories', 'film', 'based', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'Oxford', 'London', 'garnered', 'two', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'two', 'other', 'awards.Tom', 'Viv', 'elope', 'basically', 'downhill', 'gynecological', 'emotional', 'problems', 'disrupt', 'even', 'honeymoon', 'Dafoe', 'best', 'can', 'part', 'not', 'written', 'page', 'Richardson', 'one', 'trademark', 'manic', 'performances', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'almost', 'picture', 'Viv', 'worried', 'mum', 'meet', 'briefly', 'celebrated', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'literary', 'group', 'centered', 'Bloomsbury', 'London', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'company', 'get', 'obligatory', 'slow', 'Oxford', 'river', 'boating', 'scenes', 'story', 'slow', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'sound', 'often', 'bad', 'film', 'confusing', 'issue', 'why', 'Eliot', 'did', 'ca', ""n't"", 'insist', 'movie', 'should', 'do', 'so', ""n't"", 'answer', 'questions', 'raised', 'kind', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'art', 'films', 'bad', 'name']",N/A
736075,ANN4JW1E08AS6,B00008978I,tuberacer,"[7, 10]","I studied Eliot in college, wrote a couple of papers about his poetry, did all the research about the references in the ""Waste Land,"" studied the editing of his poetry by Ezra Pound (who is glaringly, completely absent in this movie), read Eliot's criticisms, and listened to the recordings of Eliot reading his poetry. I have great respect for Eliot as a poet, but when I saw that there was a dramatic movie about him I thought, my God, how could that be anything but boring? Well, I wasn't completely bored. There was a certain gripping in the question of ""what to do with Viv?"" There certainly wasn't much of anything at all to do with his poetry. Richardson's performance kept any life there was in this film. What in the world was going on with Dafoe's performance? It just went from stiff to stiffer. It was inhuman. You could have put a lampshade on his head and stuck him in the corner for awhile. I worried that someone would bump into him and they wouldn't be able to get him back up off the floor. Watching this has definitely colored my mental image of T.S. Eliot, and not for the better. Beware of this if you have interest in the real Eliot. The question is, of course, is there any truth in this? It's hard to believe, but what do I know? Perhaps it was an attempt to turn Eliot into one of ""the hollow men."" If it was, it was pretty dumb. I give it three stars for the historical recreation, the performances of everyone except the very questionable performance of Dafoe, and the attempt, at least, at making an intelligent film. I did really like the Dante-like ending, though, and perhaps that was a last minute idea that could have rescued this film--if they had used strong, fragmented, referential imagery like that throughout the movie which reflected Eliot's Wasteland poetry. At least that would have given me some indication that the filmakers had actually read any of it.",3,Huh?,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,1897,"['studied', 'Eliot', 'college', 'wrote', 'couple', 'papers', 'poetry', 'did', 'research', 'references', 'Waste', 'Land', 'studied', 'editing', 'poetry', 'Ezra', 'Pound', 'who', 'glaringly', 'completely', 'absent', 'movie', 'read', 'Eliot', 'criticisms', 'listened', 'recordings', 'Eliot', 'reading', 'poetry', 'have', 'great', 'respect', 'Eliot', 'poet', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'dramatic', 'movie', 'thought', 'God', 'how', 'could', 'that', 'be', 'anything', 'boring', 'Well', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'bored', 'was', 'certain', 'gripping', 'question', 'what', 'do', 'Viv', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'anything', 'do', 'poetry', 'Richardson', 'performance', 'kept', 'life', 'was', 'film', 'What', 'world', 'was', 'going', 'Dafoe', 'performance', 'just', 'went', 'stiff', 'stiffer', 'was', 'inhuman', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'lampshade', 'head', 'stuck', 'corner', 'awhile', 'worried', 'someone', 'would', 'bump', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'get', 'back', 'floor', 'Watching', 'definitely', 'colored', 'mental', 'image', 'T.S', 'Eliot', 'not', 'better', 'Beware', 'have', 'interest', 'real', 'Eliot', 'question', 'course', 'there', 'truth', 'hard', 'believe', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'attempt', 'turn', 'Eliot', 'one', 'hollow', 'men', 'was', 'was', 'pretty', 'dumb', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'historical', 'recreation', 'performances', 'everyone', 'very', 'questionable', 'performance', 'Dafoe', 'attempt', 'least', 'making', 'intelligent', 'film', 'did', 'really', 'Dante-like', 'ending', 'perhaps', 'was', 'last', 'minute', 'idea', 'could', 'have', 'rescued', 'film', 'had', 'used', 'strong', 'fragmented', 'referential', 'imagery', 'movie', 'reflected', 'Eliot', 'Wasteland', 'poetry', 'least', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'indication', 'filmakers', 'had', 'actually', 'read']",N/A
