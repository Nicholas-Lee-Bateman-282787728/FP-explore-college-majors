774334,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B0000CABBM,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[2, 2]","If you have gone this far as to view all of Apu trilogy, you may have gathered some insight into the work of internationally known director Satyajit Ray who died in 1992.  Born into a family of intellectuals, he was passionate about film at a young age and inspired by the greatest of directors, including neorealism filmmaking of Vitorrio de Sica.Ray explored human relationships from various angles; use of some non-actors, on-location, and use of little dialogue.  Ray is said to have known what the face of his characters would look like before the actor/nonactor was hired.  His trait was to scour for those memorable faces.  Another aspect of Ray's is the varying themes encompassed in the nearly 40 films, documentaries and short stories.  Themes dealt with life and death; traditional vs. modern values;  villages vs city;  tragedy, fantasy vs. reality, youth vs. aging;  etc.The World of Apu, (1959) named best foreign film of 1960 is the third of a trilogy, and focuses on Apu, now a man, writer, husband and father.  If you have not seen the other two, do so before this one.  ""Pather Panchali"" begins with his birth while  ""Aparajito"" follows him through his education and further family hardships.  Although the films were made in the mid-to-late 50s, the earliest depicts the mid 20s.Apu is forced to abandon his education.  By chance, he marries a beautiful woman, Aparna, who was cursed on her wedding day because her family would not allow her to marry her intended groom.  He is either insane or with some retardation.  Apu reluctantly marries her and falls deeply in love with her and she lives with him in his shabby existence.She leaves for her homeland to give birth to a son and Apu is absent for the birth.  She dies and for 5 years, he blames and rejects the child because of her death.It is here that Apu makes a decision of live, to harbor feelings on the love he lost, or his desire or willingness to re-gain a son he blamed for Aparna's death.To enjoy the depth of Apu's world, see the first two films of this trilogy, and if you embody foreign film by acclaimed filmmakers, you may feel the need to learn more about Satyajit Ray, because, sadly, the DVD has no commentary on the film.  .....Rizzo",5,Profound conclusion as  Apu becomes a man,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,2226,"['have', 'gone', 'far', 'view', 'Apu', 'trilogy', 'may', 'have', 'gathered', 'insight', 'work', 'internationally', 'known', 'director', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'who', 'died', '1992', 'Born', 'family', 'intellectuals', 'was', 'passionate', 'film', 'young', 'age', 'inspired', 'greatest', 'directors', 'including', 'neorealism', 'filmmaking', 'Vitorrio', 'de', 'Sica.Ray', 'explored', 'human', 'relationships', 'various', 'angles', 'use', 'non-actors', 'on-location', 'use', 'little', 'dialogue', 'Ray', 'said', 'have', 'known', 'what', 'face', 'characters', 'would', 'look', 'actor/nonactor', 'was', 'hired', 'trait', 'was', 'scour', 'memorable', 'aspect', 'Ray', 'varying', 'themes', 'encompassed', 'nearly', '40', 'films', 'documentaries', 'short', 'stories', 'Themes', 'dealt', 'life', 'death', 'traditional', 'vs.', 'modern', 'values', 'villages', 'vs', 'city', 'tragedy', 'fantasy', 'vs.', 'reality', 'youth', 'vs.', 'aging', 'etc.The', 'World', 'Apu', '1959', 'named', 'best', 'foreign', 'film', '1960', 'third', 'trilogy', 'Apu', 'now', 'man', 'writer', 'husband', 'father', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'other', 'two', 'do', 'so', 'one', 'Pather', 'Panchali', 'birth', 'Aparajito', 'education', 'further', 'family', 'hardships', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'mid-to-late', '50s', 'earliest', 'mid', '20s.Apu', 'forced', 'abandon', 'education', 'chance', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Aparna', 'who', 'was', 'cursed', 'wedding', 'day', 'family', 'would', 'not', 'allow', 'marry', 'intended', 'groom', 'insane', 'retardation', 'Apu', 'reluctantly', 'deeply', 'love', 'shabby', 'existence.She', 'homeland', 'give', 'birth', 'son', 'Apu', 'absent', 'birth', '5', 'years', 'child', 'death.It', 'here', 'Apu', 'decision', 'live', 'harbor', 'feelings', 'love', 'lost', 'desire', 'willingness', 're-gain', 'son', 'blamed', 'Aparna', 'death.To', 'depth', 'Apu', 'world', 'see', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'trilogy', 'embody', 'foreign', 'film', 'acclaimed', 'filmmakers', 'may', 'feel', 'need', 'learn', 'more', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'sadly', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'film', '..Rizzo']",N/A

Apu is a writer living (and starving) in Calcutta. With a friend he attends a wedding, but when the bridegroom goes insane, the wedding is called off. Apu, thinking he's doing a noble deed, marries the girl. Things between them look dubious at first, but they grow to love each other very much. When she dies in childbirth he sinks into deep depression and spends five years wandering around India like a hermit. But he has a son and though he thinks of abandoning him, he comes home finally to raise him. It's a very touching and moving film, and in it's quiet way, very emotional.

774337,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B0000CABBM,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 1]","Apur Sansar is a film that delights in little things. In the beginning of the film Apu's apartment is a disheveled mess, like most bachelors'. But, within a few scenes of her appearance there, Aparna transforms it into a place where a woman calls home, by subtle decor. Yet, Ray never calls attention to this. It just happens naturally, and only an astute observer would notice; such as a scene where he is teaching her English, because that is the language that allows Bengalis to escape poverty. At other times, he lets romantic intimacy lead one to a change in Apu: there is a deft scene where Apu finds a hairpin between pillows, and then he sees his wife doing cleaning in a hallway, and tries to light a cigarette, only to find a note from her inside his cigarette pack stating that he promised to only smoke after eating. Later, a series of playful letters are exchange between the separated couple, when she is off to her parents' place to give birth. One can sense the delight and excitement Apu gets just from reading the words of his wife, even when interrupted by a co-worker or a man on a trolley. I doubt I've ever seen onscreen love portrayed so well without any physical affection nor intercourse shown. Yet this is just an extension of the great human interactions Ray captures. Earlier, in the first sequence with Pulu, we get a sense of the depth of their friendship when, after a night on the town, the two men are returning to Apu's apartment and walking along train tracks at night. They are arguing over women, literature, and the camera just pulls back and leaves the two friends in the midst of their personal comity. Then, after Aparna has died, and Apu is bedridden with grief, Apu is seemingly brought back to reality by the screech of a train whistle- the very thing that, within the bounds of the trilogy, symbolize some greater horizon for him. Yet, we soon see that it is not a call to life that has roused him, but he seems to now be standing on tracks, waiting to be run over, until we learn that the wail we hear, when the camera moves up and away from Apu (as if to let his end come without voyeurism, and foreshadowing a similar scene of pain heard on a payphone in Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, where the camera looks away from the protagonist who is being dismissed on the phone, by a woman he desires), is that from a pig whose leg has been crushed, not Apu. Such cinematic poesy and mastery are grace notes that abound in Apur Sansar, and make it such a fabulous work of art; and one with many more moments of insight and depth than these few herein described..Oftentimes critics confuse the terms major and great, as if they were synonyms. They are not. There are great works of art that are small chamber pieces: think Woody Allen's Stardust Memories, Ingmar Bergman's The Silence, or Curse Of The Cat People. These films are gems, but contain large pieces of cosmic power in their small delineations. Then there are major films, that, while having good moments, and dealing with titanic dilemmas, miss greatness because they do not core deeply enough into things, despite their impact on the culture and their medium: think Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura, Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, or Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows. Then there are films that are both great and major, for they are technically, aesthetically, and intellectually great while having a major impact on the culture and cinema. These would be films like Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kenji Mizoguchi's Sansho The Bailiff, and Taxi Driver. Satyajit Ray's The Apu Trilogy- as a whole, or taken in bits, belongs to both classes.Apur Sansar not only has meaning, but imparts meaning to its viewers, not just of its own internal realities, but those which communicate individually to the percipient. Only humans can bring or gift meaning, for only we can comprehend it. The greatest of artists know this; yet, paradoxically, because it can be so difficult, so few even try to impart it in what they claim as their art. Satyajit Ray had no such worries, and one only wishes more filmmakers followed his lead, one which Apur Sansur so splendidly embodies.",4,Excellent,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,4181,"['Apur', 'Sansar', 'film', 'delights', 'little', 'things', 'beginning', 'film', 'Apu', 'apartment', 'disheveled', 'mess', 'most', 'bachelors', 'few', 'scenes', 'appearance', 'there', 'Aparna', 'place', 'where', 'woman', 'home', 'subtle', 'decor', 'Ray', 'never', 'attention', 'just', 'naturally', 'only', 'astute', 'observer', 'would', 'notice', 'such', 'scene', 'where', 'teaching', 'English', 'language', 'Bengalis', 'escape', 'poverty', 'other', 'times', 'romantic', 'intimacy', 'lead', 'one', 'change', 'Apu', 'deft', 'scene', 'where', 'Apu', 'hairpin', 'pillows', 'then', 'wife', 'doing', 'cleaning', 'hallway', 'tries', 'light', 'cigarette', 'only', 'find', 'note', 'cigarette', 'pack', 'stating', 'promised', 'only', 'smoke', 'eating', 'Later', 'series', 'playful', 'letters', 'are', 'exchange', 'separated', 'couple', 'when', 'off', 'parents', 'place', 'give', 'birth', 'One', 'can', 'sense', 'delight', 'excitement', 'Apu', 'just', 'reading', 'words', 'wife', 'even', 'when', 'interrupted', 'co-worker', 'man', 'trolley', 'doubt', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'onscreen', 'love', 'portrayed', 'so', 'well', 'physical', 'affection', 'intercourse', 'shown', 'just', 'extension', 'great', 'human', 'interactions', 'Ray', 'captures', 'Earlier', 'first', 'sequence', 'Pulu', 'get', 'sense', 'depth', 'friendship', 'when', 'night', 'town', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'returning', 'Apu', 'apartment', 'walking', 'along', 'train', 'tracks', 'night', 'are', 'arguing', 'women', 'literature', 'camera', 'just', 'back', 'two', 'friends', 'midst', 'personal', 'comity', 'Then', 'Aparna', 'died', 'Apu', 'bedridden', 'grief', 'Apu', 'seemingly', 'brought', 'back', 'reality', 'screech', 'train', 'whistle-', 'very', 'thing', 'bounds', 'trilogy', 'symbolize', 'greater', 'horizon', 'soon', 'see', 'not', 'call', 'life', 'roused', 'now', 'be', 'standing', 'tracks', 'waiting', 'be', 'run', 'over', 'learn', 'wail', 'hear', 'when', 'camera', 'up', 'away', 'Apu', 'let', 'end', 'come', 'voyeurism', 'foreshadowing', 'similar', 'scene', 'pain', 'heard', 'payphone', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'where', 'camera', 'away', 'protagonist', 'who', 'being', 'dismissed', 'phone', 'woman', 'pig', 'leg', 'been', 'crushed', 'not', 'Apu', 'Such', 'cinematic', 'poesy', 'mastery', 'are', 'grace', 'notes', 'abound', 'Apur', 'Sansar', 'make', 'fabulous', 'work', 'art', 'one', 'many', 'more', 'moments', 'insight', 'depth', 'few', 'herein', 'described..Oftentimes', 'critics', 'confuse', 'terms', 'major', 'great', 'were', 'synonyms', 'are', 'not', 'are', 'great', 'works', 'art', 'are', 'small', 'chamber', 'pieces', 'think', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Stardust', 'Memories', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Silence', 'Curse', 'Cat', 'People', 'films', 'are', 'gems', 'contain', 'large', 'pieces', 'cosmic', 'power', 'small', 'delineations', 'Then', 'are', 'major', 'films', 'having', 'good', 'moments', 'dealing', 'titanic', 'dilemmas', 'miss', 'greatness', 'do', 'not', 'core', 'deeply', 'enough', 'things', 'impact', 'culture', 'medium', 'think', 'Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', ""L'Avventura"", 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Francois', 'Truffaut', '400', 'Blows', 'Then', 'are', 'films', 'are', 'great', 'major', 'are', 'technically', 'aesthetically', 'intellectually', 'great', 'having', 'major', 'impact', 'culture', 'cinema', 'would', 'be', 'films', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'Kenji', 'Mizoguchi', 'Sansho', 'Bailiff', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'Apu', 'Trilogy-', 'whole', 'taken', 'bits', 'belongs', 'classes.Apur', 'Sansar', 'not', 'only', 'meaning', 'meaning', 'viewers', 'not', 'just', 'own', 'internal', 'realities', 'communicate', 'individually', 'percipient', 'Only', 'humans', 'can', 'bring', 'gift', 'meaning', 'only', 'can', 'comprehend', 'greatest', 'artists', 'know', 'yet', 'paradoxically', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'difficult', 'few', 'even', 'try', 'impart', 'what', 'claim', 'art', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'had', 'such', 'worries', 'one', 'only', 'more', 'filmmakers', 'followed', 'lead', 'one', 'Apur', 'Sansur', 'so', 'splendidly', 'embodies']",N/A

774341,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000CABBM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 4]","Having lost his sister and his parents in the first two installments of &quot;The Apu Trilogy,&quot; I made the mistake of thinking there was no one left for Apurba Roy (Soumitra Chatterjee) to lose, but Satyajit Ray proves in Apur Sansar (&quot;The World of Apu&quot;) that such expectations are foolishness.  At that start of this 1960 film Apu has left school before graduation, dreams about being a writer, and is three months behind in his rent, which forces him to sell some of his beloved books.  Then Pulu (Swapan Mukherjee), an old college friend, convinces Apu to attend a village wedding.  When the groom turns out to have gone insane because of the fasting and meditation in preparation for the wedding, Apu's friend suggests he become the groom so that the wedding can continue and the family's honor maintained.  At first Apu dismisses the idea out of hand, but then relents because he does not want the young woman to be cursed forever, and gets married to the beautiful Aparna (14-year-old Sharmila Tagore).The middle of the film shows the happy time when Apu and Aparna get to know each other and fall in love.  Two people who were complete strangers become incredibly close as we see a simple romance that rings true in a way few in cinema ever have before or since.  However, after all of the suffering and hard times we have endured to this point in the trilogy it is hard to believe that Apu has finally found happiness, and indeed tragedy follows.  We are suddenly confronted with the sense that we have come full circle and that once again our hopes in this story have come down to the fate of one small boy.Even after three films Ray's genius is in using the camera to show character.  What is memorable in these films are always the moments, and not the dialogue.  It is the look that characters give each other than communicates much more than the words.  For those who would complain that they do like to watch foreign film because it involved reading subtitles, these films should not be a problem.  Ultimately it is the cinematography of Subrata Mitra and music of Ravi Shankar that are the chief mediums of communication (the only other time I have been struck this much by a similar combination was in &quot;Road to Perdition,&quot; where the late cinematographer Conrad L.

I heard of this series and wanted to see it from the beginning, but the only one I found so far was this one, and I see that it is the third and final installment.Some people simply don't enjoy sad movies.  I see their point of view.  They want to be happy.  They don't want to be brought down by the troubles they are allowing into their lives through the film.  I know, because I'm one of them.Granted, it is a very well made movie, but the second half of it is enough to make you want to go look for that used razor blade behind the bathroom mirror and end it all.  Knowing what I know, I don't want to find the first two Apu films.  Enough is enough.Apu is a young man in India, writing a novel.  He must quit school before obtaining his college degree because he can't afford to continue his formal education.  He cheerfully lives his life in Calcutta.  He owes three months rent.  His philosophy is that life is to be lived, never mind the poverty.  He is part happy-go-lucky, part smart-ass.  My apologies to those who love him from the first two movies, but that is how he struck me.A beautiful young girl is about to marry a young man she has never met.  The man is insane.  The girl's mother calls the wedding off, over the objections of the girl's stupid, callous father.  The family believes it is bad luck to cancel a wedding, and Apu is asked to substitute as the groom.  Amazingly, he agrees.The most enjoyable scenes in the movie are the scenes involving Apu and his bride.  She gives up a life of ease to join him in a life of poverty.  They love each other.  They are funny and adorable together.Then comes the turning point in the movie, during the darling bride's return trip home to visit with her family.  This movie becomes like a bent stalk of corn, its top falling to the ground.  This movie becomes like a cracked and smashed vase.I really don't want to watch Apu drifting through life, waiting to be released by death.  It reminds me too much of myself.  I can do without that.This is a well made movie, and Apu's wife is a treasure to watch.",3,Well done but depressing,1118361600,"06 10, 2005",2005,2194,"['feel', 'outsider', 'site', 'surrounded', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'Apu', 'aficionados', 'love', 'two', 'earlier', 'films', 'heard', 'series', 'wanted', 'see', 'beginning', 'only', 'one', 'found', 'so', 'far', 'was', 'one', 'see', 'third', 'final', 'installment.Some', 'people', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'sad', 'movies', 'see', 'point', 'view', 'want', 'be', 'happy', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'brought', 'down', 'troubles', 'are', 'allowing', 'lives', 'film', 'know', ""'m"", 'one', 'them.Granted', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'second', 'half', 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'go', 'look', 'used', 'razor', 'blade', 'bathroom', 'mirror', 'end', 'Knowing', 'what', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'find', 'first', 'two', 'Apu', 'films', 'Enough', 'enough.Apu', 'young', 'man', 'India', 'writing', 'novel', 'must', 'quit', 'school', 'obtaining', 'college', 'degree', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'continue', 'formal', 'education', 'cheerfully', 'life', 'Calcutta', 'three', 'months', 'rent', 'philosophy', 'life', 'be', 'lived', 'never', 'mind', 'poverty', 'part', 'happy-go-lucky', 'part', 'smart-ass', 'apologies', 'who', 'love', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'how', 'struck', 'me.A', 'beautiful', 'young', 'girl', 'marry', 'young', 'man', 'never', 'met', 'man', 'insane', 'girl', 'mother', 'wedding', 'off', 'objections', 'girl', 'stupid', 'callous', 'father', 'family', 'bad', 'luck', 'cancel', 'wedding', 'Apu', 'asked', 'substitute', 'groom', 'Amazingly', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Apu', 'bride', 'up', 'life', 'ease', 'join', 'life', 'poverty', 'love', 'other', 'are', 'funny', 'adorable', 'together.Then', 'turning', 'point', 'movie', 'darling', 'bride', 'return', 'trip', 'home', 'visit', 'family', 'movie', 'bent', 'stalk', 'corn', 'top', 'falling', 'ground', 'movie', 'cracked', 'smashed', 'vase.I', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'Apu', 'drifting', 'life', 'waiting', 'be', 'released', 'death', 'too', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'that.This', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'Apu', 'wife', 'treasure', 'watch']",N/A

This contributes to the subtle humor when he finds himself in a situation where he must save a family's honor.Apu's ancestral family home has been destroyed; he has lost his sister, father and mother and is now living alone next to a noisy railway. As he faces the realities of existence, he spends his time reading, playing a wooden flute and occasionally looking for work. His job prospects are disheartening at best. His optimism is reminiscent of his father's attitude to life and he is also becoming a writer. His beauty and artistic carefree spirit is always in danger of being funneled into a life of quiet desperation.After reuniting with his childhood friend Pulu (Swapan Mukherjee), Apu attends a wedding in which he ends up having to make decisions that changes the entire course of his life.  Aparna (Sharmila Tagore) and Apu fall in love and yet can we hope that Apu has found true happiness? All hopes are soon dashed as the unthinkable occurs.As Apu dreams of publishing his own novel, his life plays out a story of impending doom. The scene where he lifts a child from a location close to a railroad is a foreshadowing of an event that soon takes place in his own life. Finally life throws him a challenge he is not willing to face. It takes times for Apu to process the tragedy in his life and finally he is overwhelmed by grief.Although this movie is filled with tragedy, there are moments of humor. Apu's casual defiance when he turns on the lights amused me because I'm always turning on lights and my husband is always turning them off. You will find yourself laughing at various moments throughout the Apu Trilogy.The World of Apu is best watched after viewing Pather Panchali and Aparajito. After watching all three movies I tried to sleep for a few hours and awoke with words racing through my mind. The Apu Trilogy immerses your mind in a world of contemplation and I could not help thinking that Apu was on some journey towards enlightenment. Through his suffering he learned more than he could have ever learned through a life of leisure. Throughout Apu's life he continues to show an almost undaunted optimism and in the end he exchanges the fantasy for the reality.~The Rebecca Review",5,Apu Faces the Realities of Existence and Finds Love,1081296000,"04 7, 2004",2004,2382,"['Pather', 'Panchali', 'Aparajito', 'watch', 'Apu', 'grow', 'manhood', 'be', 'very', 'unaware', 'exotic', 'Indian', 'women', 'swirling', 'beauty', 'subtle', 'humor', 'when', 'situation', 'where', 'must', 'save', 'family', 'honor.Apu', 'ancestral', 'family', 'home', 'been', 'destroyed', 'lost', 'sister', 'father', 'mother', 'now', 'living', 'alone', 'next', 'noisy', 'railway', 'realities', 'existence', 'time', 'reading', 'playing', 'wooden', 'flute', 'occasionally', 'looking', 'work', 'job', 'prospects', 'are', 'disheartening', 'best', 'optimism', 'reminiscent', 'father', 'attitude', 'life', 'also', 'becoming', 'writer', 'beauty', 'artistic', 'carefree', 'spirit', 'always', 'danger', 'being', 'funneled', 'life', 'quiet', 'desperation.After', 'reuniting', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Pulu', 'Swapan', 'Mukherjee', 'Apu', 'wedding', 'up', 'having', 'make', 'decisions', 'entire', 'course', 'life', 'Aparna', 'Sharmila', 'Tagore', 'Apu', 'fall', 'love', 'yet', 'can', 'hope', 'Apu', 'found', 'true', 'happiness', 'hopes', 'are', 'soon', 'dashed', 'unthinkable', 'occurs.As', 'Apu', 'dreams', 'publishing', 'own', 'novel', 'life', 'out', 'story', 'impending', 'doom', 'scene', 'where', 'child', 'location', 'close', 'railroad', 'foreshadowing', 'event', 'soon', 'place', 'own', 'life', 'Finally', 'life', 'challenge', 'not', 'willing', 'face', 'times', 'Apu', 'process', 'tragedy', 'life', 'finally', 'overwhelmed', 'grief.Although', 'movie', 'filled', 'tragedy', 'are', 'moments', 'humor', 'Apu', 'casual', 'defiance', 'when', 'lights', 'amused', ""'m"", 'always', 'turning', 'lights', 'husband', 'always', 'turning', 'off', 'will', 'find', 'laughing', 'various', 'moments', 'Apu', 'Trilogy.The', 'World', 'Apu', 'best', 'watched', 'viewing', 'Pather', 'Panchali', 'Aparajito', 'watching', 'three', 'movies', 'tried', 'sleep', 'few', 'hours', 'awoke', 'words', 'racing', 'mind', 'Apu', 'Trilogy', 'mind', 'world', 'contemplation', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'thinking', 'Apu', 'was', 'journey', 'towards', 'enlightenment', 'suffering', 'learned', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'learned', 'life', 'leisure', 'Apu', 'life', 'show', 'almost', 'undaunted', 'optimism', 'end', 'exchanges', 'fantasy', 'reality.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

Deming ""Backyard Trees""","[0, 0]","Thanks to a pristine Indian audience, Satyrajit Ray (1921-92) created a trilogy where a ballet-like adagio becomes an art. In this, the 1959 epilogue of our hero Apu's coming of age, Apu is swept away by misfortune, and allows ethical decisions to be made for him. Perhaps paralleling the pacifist role India has played throughout her long life, Apu permits himself to become betrothed to a woman whose fiance is unfit for marriage. Apu steps in and accepts the challenge. Why not? He is at a standstill in his writing career and feels like a poverty-stricken failure with a beautiful face.His new bride is not only sublimely gorgeous, with those big eyes the filmmaker Ray lovingly caresses, but she comes from incomparable wealth. Their arranged marriage becomes a temple of love, told tenderly with nary a touch between them. Echoing their temporary paradise the camera lingers on grassy landscapes of rural India, while Ravi Shankar's haunting sitar music flows in the background.In the final scene, the couple's son, a 5-year-old, as playful, mischievous (he throws rocks) and inquisitive as his own father, rides Apu's shoulders in victory. Triumph shines over the appalling take-us-by surprise tragedies that pierce the film. The joyful moment of father and son striding confidently into the Big City reinforces the name and motif of the trilogy: The Unvanquished.",5,The Indian Culture Will Sweep You Away!,1166054400,"12 14, 2006",2006,1371,"['Thanks', 'pristine', 'Indian', 'audience', 'Satyrajit', 'Ray', '1921-92', 'created', 'trilogy', 'where', 'ballet-like', 'adagio', 'art', '1959', 'epilogue', 'hero', 'Apu', 'coming', 'age', 'Apu', 'swept', 'away', 'misfortune', 'ethical', 'decisions', 'be', 'made', 'Perhaps', 'paralleling', 'pacifist', 'role', 'India', 'played', 'long', 'life', 'Apu', 'become', 'betrothed', 'woman', 'fiance', 'unfit', 'marriage', 'Apu', 'steps', 'accepts', 'challenge', 'Why', 'not', 'standstill', 'writing', 'career', 'feels', 'poverty-stricken', 'failure', 'beautiful', 'face.His', 'new', 'bride', 'not', 'only', 'sublimely', 'gorgeous', 'big', 'eyes', 'filmmaker', 'Ray', 'lovingly', 'incomparable', 'wealth', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'temple', 'love', 'told', 'tenderly', 'nary', 'touch', 'Echoing', 'temporary', 'paradise', 'camera', 'grassy', 'landscapes', 'rural', 'India', 'Ravi', 'Shankar', 'haunting', 'sitar', 'music', 'background.In', 'final', 'scene', 'couple', 'son', '5-year-old', 'playful', 'mischievous', 'rocks', 'inquisitive', 'own', 'father', 'Apu', 'shoulders', 'victory', 'Triumph', 'appalling', 'take-us-by', 'surprise', 'tragedies', 'pierce', 'film', 'joyful', 'moment', 'father', 'son', 'striding', 'confidently', 'Big', 'City', 'name', 'motif', 'trilogy', 'Unvanquished']",N/A
