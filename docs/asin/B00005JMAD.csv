615463,A2WRYMOJJ5WICS,B00005JMAD,Bria,"[4, 7]","I liked the first episode of Law and Order: Criminal Intent.  These two actors have taken their roles and made it their own.  I enjoyed watching Vincent act in his first interrogation.  You can tell he brings much thought to being Detective Goren, making the character strong, intelligent, and very odd in the same way.  The character he protrays is original, and that is the one thing I don't tire of when watching this show.  Kathryn plays a tough character.  Reminds me of the character Lenny Briscow, and that no nonsense attitude makes her strong and witty at the same time.  The first episode isn't as strong as the others, but it sets the format for what all the other episdoes will be like.Yes, it is true you can get this episode with the ""First Year,"" but I didn't mind getting this, as well.  I consider myself a true fan of the series, and having this DVD along with the first season doesn't bother me one bit.  I am just glad that I can watch it whenever I want, and I don't have to wait for it to come on television.",4,Enjoyed Vincent and Kathryn in this first episode.,1169251200,"01 20, 2007",2007,1030,"['liked', 'first', 'episode', 'Law', 'Order', 'Criminal', 'Intent', 'two', 'actors', 'have', 'taken', 'roles', 'made', 'own', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Vincent', 'act', 'first', 'interrogation', 'can', 'tell', 'much', 'thought', 'being', 'Detective', 'Goren', 'making', 'character', 'strong', 'intelligent', 'very', 'odd', 'same', 'way', 'character', 'original', 'one', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'tire', 'when', 'watching', 'show', 'Kathryn', 'tough', 'character', 'character', 'Lenny', 'Briscow', 'nonsense', 'attitude', 'strong', 'witty', 'same', 'time', 'first', 'episode', ""n't"", 'as', 'strong', 'others', 'format', 'what', 'other', 'episdoes', 'will', 'be', 'like.Yes', 'true', 'can', 'get', 'episode', 'First', 'Year', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'getting', 'as', 'well', 'consider', 'true', 'fan', 'series', 'having', 'DVD', 'first', 'season', ""n't"", 'bother', 'one', 'bit', 'am', 'just', 'glad', 'can', 'watch', 'whenever', 'want', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'come', 'television']",N/A

It wouldhave been nice had it been longer. I had seen the episode several times but I never realized it was the premire episode.I guess they felt guilty for the episode being so short because they also included the Premiere Episode of Law & Order...almost as if they could get you hooked to that show by giving us the first episode of that.
