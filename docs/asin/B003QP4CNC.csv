I know everyone is complaining about this not being Season 2, but the Volume format for releases of current shows is pretty much the norm recently wether is's History Channel or Fox (Family Guy etc.)So 8 (1 hour) episodes for about 15 bucks is pretty good by most standards.  If they would have done all 26 (1 hour) episodes we would probably be paying like 50-60 bucks, so really you get what you pay for basicaly.

1359110,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003QP4CNC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[18, 19]","With the History Channel expanding its reality television roster with programs with only a dubious relationship with actual history (Top Shot, Pawn Stars, Larry the Cable Guy), ""American Pickers"" fits comfortably into this new niche.  The premise, for anyone unfamiliar with the show, is that two ""pickers"" (Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz) travel the country trying to unearth hidden treasures from the various people they meet along the way.  Some of the items may have historical significance--that's the angle the History Channel uses to tie the show into its lineup.  In truth, the show has similar appeal to the classic ""Antique Roadshow"" mixed with the treasure hunting gamble of ""Storage Wars"" with a dash of ""Hoarders"" thrown in for good measure.  It's always intriguing to see what long forgotten gems might be lurking in someone's garage or junkyard.  Along the way, the boys chat up the locals and experience a different kind of Americana.Critics of the show might be disappointed by the opportunistic nature of our friendly treasure hunters.  The boys are on the prowl to make money.  So instead of the owners of the arcane memorabilia reaping the wealth, the boys try to purchase it for the lowest amount possible to resell at a great profit.  Here's where the show differs from the more owner friendly ""Roadshow.""  It's a fair point that the cynic in me agrees with but, if you think about it, most of the stuff would just rot away undiscovered without the ""pickers"" participation.  So in that way, everyone is a winner.  Also, it's a risk/reward system and there is a fair amount of gamble in the proposition of buying stuff without authentication--not everything can be a winner!  The show is surprisingly entertaining and some of the finds are spectacular indeed.  There is a lot of warmth and unexpected humor along the way as well.DVD INFO:  In a curious decision, this is labeled as Volume Two.  It is NOT Season Two.  This can be a bit misleading as the first DVD release was the entirety of Season One.  This contains EIGHT episodes only over two discs (there were 26 episodes in this season) which are being called fan favorites.  I'm a completist, so I  am mystified by this decision.  If you want to release Season Two, then release Season Two!Here's a rundown of the contents, they are the first eight episodes of the season:Art of the DealBuddy's Booby TrapGordon's Gold MineSmooth OperatorsGetting the BootEasy RidersPsychic PickingsOne Pony TownAgain, if you enjoy this type of program, there's some good stuff to be had in this DVD release.  If you've never seen the show, I might recommend you sample an episode first.  It broadcasts frequently and is available on-demand here as well.
