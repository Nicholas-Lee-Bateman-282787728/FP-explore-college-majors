He keeps saying the same thing and DRAGGING IT ON FOREVER to make more and more hours of podcasts. Why not put that energy back into movies where we all found him and loved him! These endless talks about stupid sexual jokes are so pointless and forgettable ... UNLIKE his movies which are great.

Bullock,"[0, 2]","I am aware of the act, (Silent Bob,etc) and that this type of movie is basically a ""Wow, we all get to hang out with KS and Jace"" kind of thing (much like the infinitely funnier ""Evenings With Kevin Smith"" series, but K is essentially holding J up for the whole time. J looks and sounds bewildered when he's not beating a joke to death on stage and K tries to make it all pull together. I rented the damn thing and couldn't sit through any more than the first appearance. The subsequent appearances seemed to be variations on the first. Good to see they're turning a buck with this stuff, but hey, time to retire or find a good second act, dudes. In more serious notes, kudos to J for overcoming his substance addictions.

1539377,AWG13RZGWBEYG,B007WW94TW,"Shaun L. Hall ""Firefly Fanatic""","[5, 10]",Kevin Smith is a fascinating speaker and I have all of his Q&As. This one is a different format as it is co-hosted by Jason Mewes and that is its downfall. Mewes often does a cameo on Smith's Q&As but giving him a bigger role was a mistake. He lacks the quick wit and timing of writer Smith and it makes the show much less interesting. Hearing Smith tell amusing anecdotes is always a good time but listening to Mewes ramble is for the most part boring and distracting. I cannot recommend this.,2,I guess this is getting a little old.,1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,494,"['Kevin', 'Smith', 'fascinating', 'speaker', 'have', 'Q', 'As', 'one', 'different', 'format', 'co-hosted', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'downfall', 'Mewes', 'often', 'cameo', 'Smith', 'Q', 'As', 'giving', 'bigger', 'role', 'was', 'mistake', 'quick', 'wit', 'timing', 'writer', 'Smith', 'show', 'much', 'less', 'interesting', 'Hearing', 'Smith', 'tell', 'amusing', 'anecdotes', 'always', 'good', 'time', 'listening', 'Mewes', 'ramble', 'most', 'part', 'boring', 'distracting', 'can', 'not', 'recommend']",N/A
