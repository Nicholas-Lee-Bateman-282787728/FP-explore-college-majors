1250846,A2VNHNS58QI0NO,B00260M5FA,"Betty L. Wilkins ""star gazer""","[0, 0]","While I like this series, it focuses more on the Chasers and their troubles both with the equipment and each other as they seek out tornadoes on the Great Plains. This season showcases Sean Casey, Reed Timmer and Josh Wurman and their teams. Wurman and Casey are at odds over the agreement that they must stick together on the chase. However, Casey is anxious to chase against Wurman's cautions and temporarily tries to hook up with Timmer's team. Egos clash as Wurman feels others are not in the Chase for the science while Sean thinks Josh is too cautious by half. In the meantime, equipment is breaking down and that helps to put everyone on edge. Yes, we see the storms and they are quite spectacular, but they are mirrored on the ground when the chasers get together...",4,Storms in the skies unsettled conditions on the road..............,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,774,"['like', 'series', 'more', 'Chasers', 'troubles', 'equipment', 'other', 'seek', 'out', 'tornadoes', 'Great', 'Plains', 'season', 'Sean', 'Casey', 'Reed', 'Timmer', 'Josh', 'Wurman', 'teams', 'Wurman', 'Casey', 'are', 'odds', 'agreement', 'must', 'stick', 'together', 'chase', 'However', 'Casey', 'anxious', 'chase', 'Wurman', 'cautions', 'temporarily', 'tries', 'hook', 'up', 'Timmer', 'team', 'Egos', 'clash', 'Wurman', 'others', 'are', 'not', 'Chase', 'science', 'Sean', 'thinks', 'Josh', 'too', 'cautious', 'half', 'meantime', 'equipment', 'breaking', 'down', 'put', 'everyone', 'edge', 'Yes', 'see', 'storms', 'are', 'quite', 'spectacular', 'are', 'mirrored', 'ground', 'when', 'chasers', 'get', 'together']",Storm Chasers: Season 2 (2 DVD Set)

Meteorologist Josh Wurman in the Doppler on Wheels (DOW), IMAX filmmaker Sean Casey in the Tornado Intercept Vehicle (TIV), PhD candidate Reed Timmer, and a scout team of chasers go all over Tornado Alley in search of twisters.The series shows the way the TIV is put together, and the DOW and TIV are both improved for 2008.  However, the teams are sometimes plagued by mechanical failures, by conflicts on where to go to find the most powerful storms, and of course by the life-threatening danger inherent in storm chasing.  The teams do have some successful moments, however, in their efforts to capture data and pictures that will help meteorologists better understand these killer storms.",5,The Perils and Triumphs of Storm Chasing,1263513600,"01 15, 2010",2010,792,"['second', 'season', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'Storm', 'Chasers', '2008', 'storm', 'chasing', 'season', 'Meteorologist', 'Josh', 'Wurman', 'Doppler', 'Wheels', 'DOW', 'IMAX', 'filmmaker', 'Sean', 'Casey', 'Tornado', 'Intercept', 'Vehicle', 'TIV', 'PhD', 'candidate', 'Reed', 'Timmer', 'scout', 'team', 'chasers', 'go', 'over', 'Tornado', 'Alley', 'search', 'twisters.The', 'series', 'way', 'TIV', 'put', 'together', 'DOW', 'TIV', 'are', 'improved', '2008', 'However', 'teams', 'are', 'sometimes', 'plagued', 'mechanical', 'failures', 'conflicts', 'where', 'go', 'find', 'most', 'powerful', 'storms', 'course', 'life-threatening', 'danger', 'inherent', 'storm', 'chasing', 'teams', 'do', 'have', 'successful', 'moments', 'however', 'efforts', 'capture', 'data', 'pictures', 'will', 'help', 'meteorologists', 'better', 'understand', 'killer', 'storms']",Storm Chasers: Season 2 (2 DVD Set)

1250850,A2T0DIXULILRQR,B00260M5FA,Kris128183,"[1, 1]","I was so excited when Discovery launched this show in 2007. It was so relieving that someone had finally made a proper TV Series about storms and tornadoes. Season 1 was good but only had 4 episodes. Great stuff but way too short. Series 2 has 8 episodes while both Sean Casey and Josh Wurman have new state of the art vehicles for the 2008 season. And while this season continues to follow Sean and Josh, it also picks up stormchaser Reed Timmer and his TornadoVideos.net team. The addition of Reed is fantastic because ever since he's been on the show, he and his team have provided for some of the most exciting episodes and have gotten some of the best footage of tornadoes. This is one of the few TV Series where I can say I enjoyed every single episode on the DVD set. Seasons 3 and 4 of Stormchasers are very good but quite expensive and season 1, while affordable, only has 4 episodes. Season 2 has 8 episodes and is very reasonably priced so for fans of the show this is a good DVD set to start with.",5,The Best Show on Discovery,1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,1009,"['was', 'so', 'excited', 'when', 'Discovery', 'launched', 'show', '2007', 'was', 'so', 'relieving', 'someone', 'had', 'finally', 'made', 'proper', 'TV', 'Series', 'storms', 'tornadoes', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'good', 'only', 'had', '4', 'episodes', 'Great', 'stuff', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'Series', '2', '8', 'episodes', 'Sean', 'Casey', 'Josh', 'Wurman', 'have', 'new', 'state', 'art', 'vehicles', '2008', 'season', 'season', 'follow', 'Sean', 'Josh', 'also', 'up', 'stormchaser', 'Reed', 'Timmer', 'TornadoVideos.net', 'team', 'addition', 'Reed', 'fantastic', 'ever', 'been', 'show', 'team', 'have', 'provided', 'most', 'exciting', 'episodes', 'have', 'gotten', 'best', 'footage', 'tornadoes', 'one', 'few', 'TV', 'Series', 'where', 'can', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'single', 'episode', 'DVD', 'set', 'Seasons', '3', '4', 'Stormchasers', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'quite', 'expensive', 'season', '1', 'affordable', 'only', '4', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', '8', 'episodes', 'very', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'so', 'fans', 'show', 'good', 'DVD', 'set', 'start']",Storm Chasers: Season 2 (2 DVD Set)
1250851,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B00260M5FA,magellan,"[3, 3]","Please note that this review is on the series which I saw on TV, not the DVD, so I can't speak to the quality of the video transfer.This show is one of the most unique ideas in recent years, following the trials and tribulations and several groups of tornado chasers in ""tornado alley."" The video coverage of the tornados is truly spectacular, and they even manage to set up a little tension and drama in the competition between the two younger groups of tornado chasers. The modified and reinforced ""tank""-like vehicle is cool, and I liked the fact that they spend some time going over the maps, looking at Doppler radar displays (or whatever it is) trying to figure out and pinpoint where the supercells are going to develop so they can get a lead on where to go.Overall it's a dramatic and interesting series, and sometimes the chasers get close enough to these storms so that they really are risking their lives to video these things or to gather scientific data. The only reason for the four stars is that after a while, much of the coverage gets to be repetitive. Most of the time, you're not seeing actual footage of the storms since many times the tornados just don't materialize, and when they do they're often far off in the distance, with the chasers trying frantically to get closer before the tornado has already come and gone, since timing is critical. Much of the video is just ""behind the scenes"" stuff having to do with preparation and repair of the vehicles and equipment, poring over the weather displays, or driving to and from the storm areas.Another thing I liked is the scientist and meteorologist, Josh Wurman, gets a lot of on-screen time and he often comments on what's going on and what they're trying to do, so you get the point of view of a real expert.So all in all a very fine series with a unique concept which has drama and excitement, spectacular footage of the storms, and enough human interest to often keep you on the edge of your seat as the events unfold.",4,Often dramatic coverage,1256601600,"10 27, 2009",2009,1994,"['Please', 'note', 'review', 'series', 'saw', 'TV', 'not', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'quality', 'video', 'transfer.This', 'show', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'ideas', 'recent', 'years', 'following', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'several', 'groups', 'tornado', 'chasers', 'tornado', 'alley', 'video', 'coverage', 'tornados', 'truly', 'spectacular', 'even', 'manage', 'set', 'up', 'little', 'tension', 'drama', 'competition', 'two', 'younger', 'groups', 'tornado', 'chasers', 'modified', 'reinforced', 'tank', '-like', 'vehicle', 'cool', 'liked', 'fact', 'spend', 'time', 'going', 'maps', 'looking', 'Doppler', 'radar', 'displays', 'whatever', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'pinpoint', 'where', 'supercells', 'are', 'going', 'develop', 'can', 'get', 'lead', 'where', 'go.Overall', 'dramatic', 'interesting', 'series', 'sometimes', 'chasers', 'get', 'close', 'enough', 'storms', 'so', 'really', 'are', 'risking', 'lives', 'video', 'things', 'gather', 'scientific', 'data', 'only', 'reason', 'four', 'stars', 'while', 'much', 'coverage', 'be', 'repetitive', 'Most', 'time', ""'re"", 'not', 'seeing', 'actual', 'footage', 'storms', 'many', 'times', 'tornados', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'materialize', 'when', 'do', ""'re"", 'often', 'far', 'off', 'distance', 'chasers', 'trying', 'frantically', 'get', 'closer', 'tornado', 'already', 'come', 'gone', 'timing', 'critical', 'Much', 'video', 'just', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'having', 'do', 'preparation', 'repair', 'vehicles', 'equipment', 'poring', 'weather', 'displays', 'driving', 'storm', 'thing', 'liked', 'scientist', 'meteorologist', 'Josh', 'Wurman', 'lot', 'on-screen', 'time', 'often', 'comments', 'what', 'going', 'what', ""'re"", 'trying', 'do', 'get', 'point', 'view', 'real', 'expert.So', 'very', 'fine', 'series', 'unique', 'concept', 'drama', 'excitement', 'spectacular', 'footage', 'storms', 'enough', 'human', 'interest', 'often', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'events', 'unfold']",Storm Chasers: Season 2 (2 DVD Set)
