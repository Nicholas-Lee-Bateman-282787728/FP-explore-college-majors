Excellent acting, directing, and screenplay to boot, I truly believe that Adaptation is the best film of 2002.Nick Cage is outstanding as the Kauffman twins.  You always know which twin is which because each has a different way of speaking, and their body movements are each unique.  That is only a few of the reasons why Cage is so good in this.Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper are perfect for their roles.  As usual, Streep easily fits into character.  It is also hard to imagine anyone playing LaRouche after seeing Cooper's performance.  Nicely done.The direction and screenplay are flawless.  The screenplay is the standout in all of this brilliance.  Everything is wonderfully twisted and full of excellence.Finally, on the topic of the ""third act"", as it is called.  Many reviews believe this ruins the film, but I strongly disagree.  It only strengthens points of the characters and the plot that is a satire on hollywood.  It could not be better.All in all, see this film!

604269,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JLRE,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","A big reason why I think I love `Adaptation' so much is the mere fact that I thought I was going to hate it.  Aside from Meryl Streep, who is unarguably a goddess of film, there really isn't anyone in the cast who draws me, and Nicolas Cage in my humble opinion is a terrible actor.  So, it's safe to say that my expectations for this film were very low and so when the film grabbed me by the collar and drew me in for it's entirety I was blown away by my response to it.  `Adaptation' truly is a brilliant film.  It's witty, quirky, funny, engrossing and, above all else, truly original.The film revolves around screenwriter Charlie Kaufman as he attempts to adapt a non-fiction novel for the screen, a novel that upon reading he discovers is unadaptable.  This novel, entitled `The Orchid Thief', is somewhat plotless and ultimately boring.  While the idea and or proposition was flattering the task is proving to be a much bigger one then Charlie had initially intended.  But Charlie has more than just this one problem in his lap.  Charlie's twin brother has suffered a sudden serge of writers fever and his apparent niche for the profession is driving Charlie mad.  As Charlie battles himself over how to proceed with the script we see in flashbacks the writer Susan Orlean as she meets and falls deeply in love the `the orchid thief' himself John Laroche.This film is truly an actor's showcase with everyone in the cast taking a hold of their character and fleshing them out beautifully.  Chris Cooper is fantastic as the eccentric Laroche and Meryl Streep is her usual brilliance, but this time raising the bar so-to-speak.  Her performance as Susan Orlean is deliciously orgasmic.  She's stunning, heartbreaking, impish and completely insane, all within seconds of one another and they all mesh so well with the character she's created.  She becomes the focus of our attention, especially as the film draws to a close.Nicolas Cage though is undoubtedly the star of this film and he delivers more than I ever thought he would.  I personally find Cage to be a bore of an actor who rarely ever sells it.  I've found him intriguing in a few films but never to the magnitude that is `Adaptation'.  Here, playing two completely different characters, he is able to distinguish them as separate while still building a foundation of similarity to classify them as brothers, as twins.  He's reserved, quiet and agitated one minute, then outlandish, outgoing and obnoxious the next.  I still am in shock at how wonderfully on point he really was here.Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman is a brilliant writer and his films are some of the most ingenious of the bunch.  I can see this happening to him, his taking `The Orchid Thief' and wondering just how he is going to make it approachable and entertaining and then it hits him and `Adaptation' is born.  Coincidentally that is just what happened here for the film is based off of Kaufman's struggle to adapt this very novel.  Who ever thought a movie about flowers would be this engrossing.I highly recommend this masterclass of a film to anyone wanting a unique and intriguing trip through the world of modern cinema.  It rarely gets better than this.",5,"Smart, entertaining and about as original as they come; I can't see how anyone could be disappointed...",1194998400,"11 14, 2007",2007,3194,"['big', 'reason', 'why', 'think', 'love', 'Adaptation', 'so', 'much', 'mere', 'fact', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'hate', 'Aside', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'who', 'unarguably', 'goddess', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'cast', 'who', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'humble', 'opinion', 'terrible', 'actor', 'So', 'safe', 'say', 'expectations', 'film', 'were', 'very', 'low', 'so', 'when', 'film', 'grabbed', 'collar', 'drew', 'entirety', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'response', 'Adaptation', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'film', 'witty', 'quirky', 'funny', 'engrossing', 'else', 'truly', 'original.The', 'film', 'revolves', 'screenwriter', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'adapt', 'non-fiction', 'novel', 'screen', 'novel', 'reading', 'unadaptable', 'novel', 'entitled', 'Orchid', 'Thief', 'somewhat', 'plotless', 'ultimately', 'boring', 'idea', 'proposition', 'was', 'flattering', 'task', 'proving', 'be', 'much', 'bigger', 'one', 'then', 'Charlie', 'had', 'initially', 'intended', 'Charlie', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'problem', 'lap', 'Charlie', 'twin', 'brother', 'suffered', 'sudden', 'serge', 'writers', 'fever', 'apparent', 'niche', 'profession', 'driving', 'Charlie', 'mad', 'Charlie', 'how', 'proceed', 'script', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'writer', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'deeply', 'love', 'orchid', 'thief', 'John', 'Laroche.This', 'film', 'truly', 'actor', 'showcase', 'everyone', 'cast', 'taking', 'hold', 'character', 'fleshing', 'out', 'beautifully', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'fantastic', 'eccentric', 'Laroche', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'usual', 'brilliance', 'time', 'raising', 'bar', 'so-to-speak', 'performance', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'deliciously', 'orgasmic', 'stunning', 'heartbreaking', 'impish', 'completely', 'insane', 'seconds', 'one', 'mesh', 'so', 'well', 'character', 'created', 'focus', 'attention', 'especially', 'film', 'close.Nicolas', 'Cage', 'though', 'undoubtedly', 'star', 'film', 'more', 'ever', 'thought', 'would', 'personally', 'find', 'Cage', 'be', 'bore', 'actor', 'who', 'rarely', 'ever', ""'ve"", 'found', 'intriguing', 'few', 'films', 'never', 'magnitude', 'Adaptation', 'Here', 'playing', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'characters', 'able', 'distinguish', 'separate', 'still', 'building', 'foundation', 'similarity', 'classify', 'brothers', 'twins', 'reserved', 'quiet', 'agitated', 'one', 'minute', 'then', 'outlandish', 'outgoing', 'obnoxious', 'next', 'still', 'am', 'shock', 'how', 'wonderfully', 'point', 'really', 'was', 'here.Screenwriter', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'brilliant', 'writer', 'films', 'are', 'most', 'ingenious', 'bunch', 'can', 'see', 'happening', 'taking', 'Orchid', 'Thief', 'wondering', 'just', 'how', 'going', 'make', 'approachable', 'entertaining', 'then', 'Adaptation', 'born', 'Coincidentally', 'just', 'what', 'happened', 'here', 'film', 'based', 'Kaufman', 'struggle', 'adapt', 'very', 'novel', 'Who', 'ever', 'thought', 'movie', 'flowers', 'would', 'be', 'engrossing.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'masterclass', 'film', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'unique', 'intriguing', 'trip', 'world', 'modern', 'cinema', 'rarely', 'better']",N/A

Hollywood to Santa Monica to see it, walked in the theatre, and within half an hour was bored. There were funny moments, that's undeniable. Nick Cage's acting was better than it has been in years, also undeniable.But the connecting tissue in this film is Kaufman's own anxieties over being able to write the screenplay to the movie itself, and well, truth be told, it's just not enough.In addiction to that, the hyper-manic, fantastically funny, terribly absurd ending that Kaufman wrote onto the second draft version of the script that I read was shortened and made...well, average.

Some people from the movie really do exist: script writer Charlie Kaufman (he even roughly resembles Nicolas Cage who plays him), the New Yorker journalist Susan Orlean and the Florida orchid thief named Laroche about whom she wrote a book. ""Adaptation"" was originally meant to be a film version of the book. BUT, apparently, Kaufman had problems with it (maybe trying too hard to match his and director Spike Jonze's first hit ""Being John Malkovich"")... So he helped himself out by letting fantasy take it from there. The film thus has both real and 'unreal' characters and events, shifts back and forth in time like crazy and at the end changes completely from a light comedy to a would-be generic thriller. ""Adaptation"" owes much to Hollywood -- it adores it and mocks it at the same time.

Within this conceit, he manages to put up a great deal of the story of the writer Susan Orlean's (Streep) relationship with her great central character John LaRoche (Cooper), the Orchid Thief, while making sharply observed side digressions concerning Kaufman's self-loathing, frustrations with writing, and not only his disgust with the dumbed-down expectations of Hollywood but the demoralizing success of those who cater to those low expectations.Full of keen cameos by Tilda Swinton and  Brian Cox among others, the story goes wildly off the tracks in a last act fantasy that is a jarringly  different movie.

I mean, how could anyone possibly write a great adaptation for &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot;? It doesn't have a plot, it's full of ruminations about flowers... It's just not movie material.Okay, okay. I know that a lot of people thought this movie was great. I know, I know, 4 Academy nominations. Geez, says so on the box. Got a lot of good reviews from critics, I recognize that. This is strictly my personal view, but I hated it.The interweaving of the many threads (The screen writer's self-contempt, his jealousy for his twin brother, the screen writer's struggle to write an adaptation for a book that refuses to be adapted, the 'real' story about Susan Orleanne and LaRoche, blah blah blah) failed. The whole idea of making &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot; into a movie was a bad idea in the first place, but this definitely wasn't the best way to go about it. It's boring, it doesn't draw you into the story, it's choppy, it hasn't been edited enough, it will leave you depressed, and it might make you a bit angry because of disappointed expectations.I hated the main character. I didn't want to say this, since he's based on a real person (the screen writer for this movie) but I did. He whines. He complains. He hates everyone, including himself. He's arrogant. He's embittered. And the worst thing is he hasn't got a single real problem that accounts for his attitude. The movie was all the worse for his inclusion and the fact that he is the protagonist we have to spend our time with. I wanted to shout, &quot;Get a life, you whiner! Some people actually HAVE REAL problems, unlike you!&quot; He shouldn't have included himself in the movie. It's hard, listening to his self-loathing and hatred for over an hour. Maybe he should've taken some advice from McKee; leave out some parts that aren't necessary. How are you supposed to sympathize with a protagonist you hate?There are two way to look at it; You either think, like the movie critics, that1)This movie was an 'intriguing, original, witty, zestful, thoughtful play upon the thin line between fact and fiction'or you think, like me, that2)The screen writer became desperate. He took the first idea that popped into his mind--write about his own dilemma! What a delightful turn, whee-hee! But... Uh-oh...He get's a bit stuck along the way, throws in some unbelievable twists, makes a fairy tale out of the whole thing, and gives himself a girlfriend and a good ending. The fact that it's a blend between fact and fiction hurts the movie more than it compliments it. You keep thinking, 'Jesus, that just can't be happening. No, that's not right. Oh no, oh no, WRONG TURN!'The actors did a good job, though. Great casting, great performances.I normally like intelligent art-indie style movies. I loved Magnolia. I was all prepared to like this one, or I should say, 'geared-up' to like Adaptation... After all, if I don't, I'll be in the minority within the group of 'intelligent movie watchers', wouldn't I?

In the case of ADAPTATION one can safely say that no one of these elements outshone the others. All were superb and that is what makes the film a semi-cult classic.  The multi-level story seems complex at first but it is a case where the story ""writes itself"".A writer for the New Yorker (Meryl Streep) reads about a man who tried to steal the mythical ""Ghost"" orchid from a swamp. She decides this would make a good article and meets the man, a rough redneck ""character"" who is the opposite of her well-heeled, erudite, liberal, boring crowd. She has an obscene fascination with the man we he draws her into his world of serial obsessions. The article eventually becomes a best-selling novel and Cage, a serious moody writer, is chosen to make the conversion to cinema.The audience sees events unfolding in various points in time: Streep and the orchid man draw close, she speaks of her boredom, Cage struggles with life, love and the screenplay. Cage's fratboy  twin writes a  horror screenplay using every Hollywood cliche and it is an overnight success. Cage relents and asks his brother for help in finishing his own play (he knows something is missing) and they discover the truth. The Ghost contains an LSD-like drug and Streep is as addicted to it as she is to the Orchid man. The four unit for an explosive ending that I will not give away.The playwright and director(Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze) have again worked their magic with subtle nuances and rich cinematic artistry. Streep, who seems attracted to ""stories within stories"" was perfect as the modern woman is search of passion. Cooper, as the strange Larouche (Orchid Man), comes off authentic, a hick intellectual who is more ""real"" than his New York counterparts.

While the manipulative Donald harangues his brother and gradually works on a serial killer script with a daft twist (Jonze making  fun of Hollywood's lack of originality), Charlie is handed the mammoth task of adapting  journalist Susan Orlean's fact based novel THE ORCHID THIEF for the big screen. So naturally he heads straight for the source and meets with Orlean (played by Meryl Streep) and the inspiration for her book John LaRoche (Chris Cooper in an award winning performance); the renegade redneck Orchid Thief in the flesh.With so much raw material in front of him, Charlie sets about working his interview subjects into his script along with his own experiences. This makes for a film that is sometimes confusing on first viewing; but try and bear with it, because this is a movie where the viewers patience helps reap the reward.As usual, Cage and Streep are excellent and Cooper, of course is dyanamite. Kaufman's (the REAL Kaufman) script breaks EVERY screenwriting rule in the book, so as a guy who enjoys bending rules, I can fully applaud this. Kaufman and Jonze even manage to work in a dig at BEING JOHN MALKOVICH into the movie; which film buffs will especially enjoy.To give an idea of how complex ADAPTATION is, it's taken me two weeks to actually get around to writing this review.

Eshbach ""Ben Eshbach""","[0, 1]","In the story ""Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius"" the writer, Borges, authors his narrator to pen the following words:""...Bioy Casares had dined with me that night and talked to us at length about a great scheme for writing a novel in the first person, using a narrator who omitted or corrupted what happened and who ran into various contradictions, so that only a handful of readers, a very small handful, would be able to decipher the horrible or banal reality  behind the novel.""Adaptation is a story about twin brothers who are screenwriters. Together they write a screenplay adaptation of a book about flowers. We the audience see none of this happen. We never get to see the twin brother Narrators. We never get to see them working on a screenplay. It is all happening in that conceptual space where sits the Narrator - it is not filmed. What we do get to see, though, is the film/adaptation they made, The Orchid Thief, starring Nicholas Cage and Meryl Streep. The twin narrators have written themselves into The Orchid Thief and thus of course appear as twin characters (both played by Nicholas Cage) who are both made to look homely and inferior in their own ways.We are at first led to believe that we are watching a story unfold - a story about the process of writing a screenplay adaptation of a book about flowers. Eventually though, through a series of self-referential remarks and incongruous events, the audience is several times clued that they are indeed watching the finished film - not the process of making the finished film. The elegant and hilarious final quarter of the film is the result of one Narrator/twin having taken over writing for the other. Even this Narrative-level switch is humorously referenced at The Orchid Thief level right before its effects are shown.In the passage from Borges we are told that a handful will decipher a meaning from the Narrator's spotty writing. But what of the very big handful who do not? Naturally they will be attentive enough to spot the ""various contradictions"" (or in Adaptation, the self reference and incongruous ending) but perhaps not patient enough to notice that these imperfections have design - that they are all pointing at something very solid.  To the distracted observer these various incongruities may seem like errors on Borges' part (or Cesares', or Kaufman's) - careless or amateurish mistakes - or even worse, deliberately sophisticated ambiguity. It is to the credit of Kaufman and Jonze that they could make Adaptation tolerable to the large handful who were glued to The Orchid Thief.The Orchid Thief is, in its own right, a very very good and funny film too. Critics find all sorts of snazzy things to chomp on here but can't seem to put them together to make anything but an ""almost-there"" for Kaufman. Kaufman is apparantly staying mum about the ""meaning"" of the film, allowing critics to apprehend his film the way Donald would. If you want to read about it just go online and read the reviews.

It's just Nicholas Cage in another one of his dozen bad movies. Cage's acting is well done and the best since ""Leaving Las Vegas"", but not as outstanding just for the fact the characters in this movie are not likeable, nor is the story any good. It was very boring not to mention also very depressing. Some comical aspects are in this movie but the filmakers are WAY OVER thinking this whole project of just a movie.The filmakers are so ""high on themselves"" that it's almost emmbarrasing to the average movie go-er to bother even watching.This is the kind of CRAP the Hollywood bozos like to call art and amuze themselves with I guess. In no shape or form would I call this David Lynch wannabe any form of art. As a average movie go-er looking for a good comedy-drama, this one just plain stinks and the only thing that held it together was the acting in the movie.Too bad it couldn't of been redone with a better outlook on life and alot better ACTUAL WRITTING. Which is what the movie is about. I suppose half the reason this movie stunk, IN MY OPINION, is because the writters must've had writter's block and nowhere to go, or only to peddle this bad movie to their Hollywood buddies that would approve.I suppose if you like the kind of movies where Hollywood people are into themselves, then this is your flick.Wanna see a REAL movie? Rent ""The Big Lebowski"" for some good writting for a dumb movie. Plus it's actually funny and not depressing like this one.I wanted to like this movie, but I ended up hating it. The bad acid-trip like story telling and writting overshadows Nic Cage's acting and just makes this one a mess in my opinion.I have also recently noticed that on amazon if you write a public ""opinion"" review of a movie, ESPECIALLY a movie that has fans, basically ""fanatics"" of a certain movie, they give you bad ratings. These are the same David Lynch fans that never can ever explain what they just seen, so they call it ""a form of art"". I respect other opinions of movies and if they enjoyed it then good for them.But my review is for those that if your NOT into the whole ""Hollywood scene""  then I would figure they might not like this movie. I found nothing facinating about this movie.

After winning the Oscar for ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" he started making action adventure films and his heavyweight acting abilities were hidden.  Those skills triumphantly return in ""Adaptation,"" a brilliantly original film penned by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze, both of ""Being John Malkovich"" fame for their writing and directing.  I needed to see ""Being John Malcovich"" several times in order to appreciate it to the fullest extent and I suspect the same is true for this film.  There is so much going on in both films that one viewing is not enough to process it all.  I wish I could say this about more films because I delight in the complexity of such a film and welcome discovering something new with each viewing.  The plot revolves around screenwriter Kaufman's escalating difficulties with writing a screenplay adaptation of a book, ""The Orchid Thief."" This book is more of a meditation than a plot around a structural core which is what most books are.  He can't write it, so in the ultimate irony, makes his own meditation about creativity, the artistic process and living inside and outside one's artistic creations.  He pulls himself, a twin brother who does not exist in the real world (I suspect he is Kaufman's id), the novelist and the protagonist of the book into his screenplay as characters and brings them all together, fittingly enough, in the place all creation begins, the primordial swamp.  Of course, his swamp is in Florida but close enough! Some viewers do not like this film.  Other viewers positively hate it. This movie requires a lot of thinking on the part of the viewer and is also an extended metaphorical riff.  If you don't like the idea of an entire film being a metaphorical riff about the creative process and the creative stew, then you will not like this film.

604292,A3PP64HMEYIGF0,B00005JLRE,CastleD,"[3, 6]","*minor spoilers*Adaptation, like 99% of all movies, has it's flaws and drawbacks. Since I judge a movie relative to the other junk out there I thought it was great despite these small flaws. It may have come up short in a few areas but Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman tried real hard to come up with something new, different and fresh here, and I admire that. At least they tried. They weren't afraid to take wild creative risks, and that's more than I can say for the mass market pulp churned out of Hollywood on a weekly basis.Nicholas Cage was wildly entertaining as Charlie and Donald Kaufman and I actually enjoyed his painful, existential meanderings about life and the creative process. Some critics mentioned how this movie presented a ""scathing indictment"" (an overused phrase) of the Hollywood movie industry, but I tend to disagree with that. It's almost as if Spike Jonze and Kaufman are apologizing for, even sympathizing with Hollywood and it's cliched scripts, plots and stories, not criticizing it. How? Well, Nicholas Cage plays a character trying to do the seemingly impossible, create a story simply about flowers; with no cliches, no guns, car chases, wild character arcs, and other overblown drama. Well, it drove him to near insanity, to the depths of despair, to try and create something different that people haven't seen before. In other words, it's not easy to create something original, and if Cage portrayed someone who had an easy time of it, then that would have been your scathing indictment.Also, I'm probably one of the few to admit it, but I actually found myself agreeing with the screenwriter ""guru"" Robert McKee while he was giving his speech on stage about how ""nothing happens in the world? are you out of your f*****g mind?"" His character did not come off like a cliched moron, he made good points. Another thing I'd like to admit is that I liked the last third of the movie, but not simply because it was clever that Donald Kaufman took over the script. Because it was exciting, and yet it contained all the cliches Charlie and the rest of us annoyed moviegoers are always complaining about. What does that mean, that I'm one of the stupid gullible masses who likes my entertainment spoonfed to me? Probably not. It's not the cliches that suck, it's how they're presented. How good the actors are, and how to present your cliche in an original way. Haha.

604293,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00005JLRE,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","I don't think I have seen a film like Adaptation. It is unique. It is a film about the difficulty of screen writing a film based on a plotless book which is the film that you are actually viewing. Did you follow that? Actually it is a funny film with Nicholas Cage playing a totally insecure screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman. Screenwriter Kaufman and director, Spike Jonze, have produced a film full of irony. Nicholas Cage's performance was perfect, filling me with anxiety as I watch the character Charlie Kaufman in all his insecurity and self-defeating life choices. Charlie Kaufman has been asked to write the script for a book that is actually more about reflection than about any discernable structured narrative. The task is driving him crazy since he sees the art in the original book, The Orchid Thief, but he struggles to figure out how to make it into a script for a film. He is plagued by a twin brother who wishes to become a screenwriter and is taking a class on screenwriting. Cage plays both roles perfectly. The twin brothers, Charlie and Donald, must be enough alike to appear as realistic twins but yet different enough for the viewers to easily distinguish them. Kaufman, Jonze, and Cage pull off this difficult task perfectly. The book, The Orchid Thief, written by New Yorker writer Susan Orlean, is based on real events but the events don't add up to a film. Eventually the film spins into wild fiction after Charlie gets the advice of a screen writing seminar teacher.Meryl Streep is excellent as Susan Orlean, the sophisticated writer, who feels passionless and thus is fascinated by those folks who do feel passion in their life. Chris Cooper, possibly the best actor in Hollywood, plays the orchid thief. After seeing Cooper in this role, I am convinced he can play any part to perfection.The title of the film, Adaptation, has multiple meanings in the film, both in regard to biological evolution and human growth. The first 80% of the film is about Kaufman's inability to write the script, however after he gets advice from the screenwriter instructor, the last 20% becomes pure wild Hollywood with car chases, car crashes, attempted murders, and romantic resolution. The last 20% is pure ironic commentary on film-making as well as a perfect contrast to the previous 80% about writer's block. The film is unique, clever, thought-provoking, and wonderfully acted.

604296,AH5Z0XEQHQL0W,B00005JLRE,"Chris Bundoc ""filmmaniac""","[0, 1]","Adaptation is a film that pulls in the audience right from the very beginning. To the brilliant performances, incredible writing and outstanding direction.The movie is about Charlie Kaufman (Nicolas Cage), who is hired to adapt a book into a film, called 'The Orchid Thief' which is written by Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep). This novel is taken from her experience of meeting with a 'flower man' named John Laroche (Chris Cooper).All I can say is that 'Adaptation' is a film that I have never experienced before. I saw Spike Jonze's other film, 'Being John Malkovich', and was very confused by it. Probably because I never really got what it was all about. But, watching 'Adaptation', and seeing that they incorporated that movie into the film wasn't that bad for me, because even though, 'Being John Malkovich' didn't entice me that much, it just made me feel complete that I saw that movie first, before watching 'Adaptation'.Moving along, the cast is Excellent! Nicolas Cage is an actor that I was never really into, but after seeing him in this movie, I have to say that his performance is superb. Also, Meryl Streep gives her real life character Susan Orlean a very good twist. Streep went all out on this movie, and didn't hide anything. I probably liked her performance, in this movie more than in 'The Hours' (which is also worth watching). Chris Cooper won his Oscar for this movie and deserved it as one of the characters that is starnge but also very funny, complete with the long hair and the gold teeth. All of the performances are exceptional!This movie should have won immediately right from the screenplay category.

Slipman,"[0, 1]","Director Spike Jonze and screen writer Charlie Kaufman masterfully collaborate to create a truly terrific madcap farcical story within a story that is Adaptation.Nicolas Cage does a superb job in his portrayal of twin screen writing brothers Charlie(!) and Donald Kaufman.  Charlie, having tasted success in Being John Malkovich is an insecure, self condemning introvert.  He has been commissioned with the project of converting the novel The Orchid Thief to the screen.  Lacking the proper motivation, he developes a monstrous writer's block which is throwing him into a major bout of depression.  Meanwhile his outgoing, yet marginally talented brother is gleaning success with a preposterous script about a killer with multiple personalities.The story within the story revolves around the plot contained within the novel The Orchid Thief.  Meryl Streep, playing the author of the novel, Susan Orleans, is shown in flashback format getting information for her novel about nut case John Laroche, a brilliant horticulturist on trial for illegally harvesting rare orchids from a state preserve.  Laroche is played spectacularly and in Oscar deserving form by a toothless Chris Cooper.  Laroche's storied life has been plagued by tragedy.Cage, desperate for inspiration decides to meet with Streep to get some insight as his writing efforts are turning into a jumbled mess. His deadline is rapidly approaching.  Cage travels to New York but spinelessly can't get the courage to speak to Streep.  Cage, playing Charlie recruits his brother Donald to help him follow Streep to Florida, where she is having a rendez-vous with Cooper.  That confrontation results in an utterly unpredictable ending.Spike Jones should be greatly commended for his work on this movie.

604299,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B00005JLRE,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 4]","Adaptation was a highly lauded film, critically, but nowhere near a great film. Yes, Chris Cooper won an Oscar for his turn as botanist John LaRoche, & it is a good performance until the film tanks, as well as his acting. Again, it's no defense to claim the screenplay or director wanted deliberately bad, hammy, over-the-top acting. Anyone who's seen CC in earlier roles in John Sayles films such as Matewan or Lone Star knows he is 1 of the best actors of our times. Adaptation is not in a league with either of those 2 performances. Anyway, here's the basic pr&eacute;cis of the film: The L.A. screenwriter of the film Being John Malkovich- Charlie Kaufman (played by Nicolas Cage)- is having trouble adapting the next film assignment he's been given. The book is a non-fiction best-seller called The Orchid Thief, written by a Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep)- a writer for The New Yorker- about an oddball character, who is obsessed with orchids, she was sent to profile for a magazine piece. This is CC's LaRoche character. The book (a real book, by the way) proves difficult to adapt- for both its substance & its style. So the fictional CK character is stuck. Now, here's the 1st twist: the real CK, who wrote the actual film, decided to create a fictional twin brother for the fictional version of himself. This character is Donald Kaufman (also played by Nicolas Cage). Here's where the 1st problems with the film arises- & it's not about Post-Modernism, but then the film exploits every known clich&eacute; about writers & twins. CK has writer's block, & suffers, & is an outcast, filled with angst, & a putz around pretty women. His brother is his near exact opposite- smooth, witty, uncreative, not-too bright, yet he tries to mimic his brother by becoming a screenwriter & working on the text for a dull slasher film. CK, of course, disdains & looks down upon DK.Of course, the rest of the film follows a pretty predictable track, even as it intercuts between the artistic dilemmas of the 2 brothers, CK's going to a screenwriting guru (at DK's behest), & the presumed `real' tale of John LaRoche & SO's profiling of him. Predictability sets in when CK's artistic paralysis increases, DK's screenplay is lauded as brilliant by CK's agent & he gets a huge advance, then CK turns to his brother for advice on how to finish his adaptation of The Orchid Thief. DK ends up going to interview SO about the book, posing as CK- who requested it. DK suspects that SO is a liar & hiding her true feelings for JL. This is where the film really tanks- what happens next is so predictable I feel almost foolish extrapolating- but here goes: this is where DK's `influence' on the real `outer' screenplay is felt. De facto- this is where the real Charlie Kaufman (not the NC version) felt he could slack off, & indulge all his worst instincts & fob off the film's failings on the Post-Modernist crutch. Let me chart the precipitous plunge. Basically, SO & JL turn out to be drug-addled lovers who capture the spying CK (who's followed SO to Florida with his brother to see what she's up to). They plan to murder him & dump him in the swamps where JL went hunting orchids. DK, of course, kiboshes the plan & both twins become the hunted. DK ends up dead, along with JL, & CK heads back to L.A. for the film's denouement, to explain lessons learned. The fictive  DK is credited as co-writer & the film even ends with a memorial dedication to the dead fictive writer.Here is where the film's advocates declaim its brilliance- that the film is actually mocking predictability by being predictable because, of course, this was the fictional DK's influence. That the real film does not tell us more about the interesting characters from the actual book is glossed over in favor of the real CK's presumption of his own (or his fictive self's) interestingness is treated as some artistic breakthrough, when it's really an infantile throwback to the `art' films of the 1960s & 1970s. The best performance in the film actually comes from perpetually underrated standout actor Brian Cox, as the screenwriting guru Robert McKee who inspires DK, then CK. There are the obligatory star cameos by actors from Being John Malkovich playing themselves- including director Spike Jonze, John Malkovich, Catherine Keener, John Cusack, & the real Susan Orlean playing a woman in a grocery store.",2,Mediocre,1222300800,"09 25, 2008",2008,4367,"['Adaptation', 'was', 'highly', 'lauded', 'film', 'critically', 'nowhere', 'great', 'film', 'Yes', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'won', 'Oscar', 'turn', 'botanist', 'John', 'LaRoche', 'good', 'performance', 'film', 'tanks', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'Again', 'defense', 'claim', 'screenplay', 'director', 'wanted', 'deliberately', 'bad', 'hammy', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'CC', 'earlier', 'roles', 'John', 'Sayles', 'films', 'such', 'Matewan', 'Lone', 'Star', '1', 'best', 'actors', 'times', 'Adaptation', 'not', 'league', '2', 'performances', 'Anyway', 'here', 'basic', 'pr', 'eacute', 'cis', 'film', 'L.A.', 'screenwriter', 'film', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich-', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'played', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'having', 'trouble', 'adapting', 'next', 'film', 'assignment', 'been', 'given', 'book', 'non-fiction', 'best-seller', 'called', 'Orchid', 'Thief', 'written', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'writer', 'New', 'Yorker-', 'oddball', 'character', 'who', 'obsessed', 'orchids', 'was', 'sent', 'profile', 'magazine', 'piece', 'CC', 'LaRoche', 'character', 'book', 'real', 'book', 'way', 'difficult', 'adapt-', 'substance', 'style', 'fictional', 'CK', 'character', 'stuck', 'Now', 'here', '1st', 'twist', 'real', 'CK', 'who', 'wrote', 'actual', 'film', 'decided', 'create', 'fictional', 'twin', 'brother', 'fictional', 'version', 'character', 'Donald', 'Kaufman', 'also', 'played', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Here', 'where', '1st', 'problems', 'film', 'arises-', 'not', 'Post-Modernism', 'then', 'film', 'known', 'clich', 'eacute', 'writers', 'twins', 'CK', 'writer', 'block', 'suffers', 'outcast', 'filled', 'angst', 'putz', 'pretty', 'women', 'brother', 'near', 'exact', 'opposite-', 'smooth', 'witty', 'uncreative', 'not-too', 'bright', 'yet', 'mimic', 'brother', 'becoming', 'screenwriter', 'working', 'text', 'dull', 'slasher', 'film', 'CK', 'course', 'down', 'upon', 'DK.Of', 'course', 'rest', 'film', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'track', 'even', 'artistic', 'dilemmas', '2', 'brothers', 'CK', 'going', 'screenwriting', 'guru', 'DK', 'behest', 'presumed', 'real', 'tale', 'John', 'LaRoche', 'SO', 'profiling', 'Predictability', 'sets', 'when', 'CK', 'artistic', 'paralysis', 'increases', 'DK', 'screenplay', 'lauded', 'brilliant', 'CK', 'agent', 'huge', 'advance', 'then', 'CK', 'brother', 'advice', 'how', 'finish', 'adaptation', 'Orchid', 'Thief', 'DK', 'up', 'going', 'interview', 'SO', 'book', 'posing', 'CK-', 'who', 'requested', 'DK', 'SO', 'liar', 'hiding', 'true', 'feelings', 'JL', 'where', 'film', 'really', 'tanks-', 'what', 'next', 'so', 'predictable', 'feel', 'almost', 'foolish', 'extrapolating-', 'here', 'where', 'DK', 'influence', 'real', 'outer', 'screenplay', 'felt', 'De', 'facto-', 'where', 'real', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'not', 'NC', 'version', 'felt', 'could', 'slack', 'off', 'indulge', 'worst', 'instincts', 'fob', 'off', 'film', 'failings', 'Post-Modernist', 'crutch', 'Let', 'chart', 'precipitous', 'plunge', 'Basically', 'SO', 'JL', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'drug-addled', 'lovers', 'who', 'capture', 'spying', 'CK', 'who', 'followed', 'SO', 'Florida', 'brother', 'see', 'what', 'up', 'plan', 'murder', 'dump', 'swamps', 'where', 'JL', 'went', 'hunting', 'orchids', 'DK', 'course', 'plan', 'become', 'hunted', 'DK', 'up', 'dead', 'JL', 'CK', 'back', 'L.A.', 'film', 'denouement', 'explain', 'lessons', 'learned', 'fictive', 'DK', 'credited', 'co-writer', 'film', 'even', 'memorial', 'dedication', 'dead', 'fictive', 'writer.Here', 'where', 'film', 'advocates', 'declaim', 'brilliance-', 'film', 'actually', 'mocking', 'predictability', 'being', 'predictable', 'course', 'was', 'fictional', 'DK', 'influence', 'real', 'film', 'not', 'tell', 'more', 'interesting', 'characters', 'actual', 'book', 'glossed', 'favor', 'real', 'CK', 'presumption', 'own', 'fictive', 'self', 'interestingness', 'treated', 'artistic', 'breakthrough', 'when', 'really', 'infantile', 'throwback', 'art', 'films', '1960s', '1970s', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'actually', 'perpetually', 'underrated', 'standout', 'actor', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'screenwriting', 'guru', 'Robert', 'McKee', 'who', 'DK', 'then', 'CK', 'are', 'obligatory', 'star', 'cameos', 'actors', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'playing', 'themselves-', 'including', 'director', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'John', 'Cusack', 'real', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'playing', 'woman', 'grocery', 'store']",N/A

I didn't know much if anything about it but I knew it starred TWO Nicholas Cage's and I generally cannot stand him so I never bothered to watch it until last week when I raided the local Blockbuster for almost every movie released in 2002 and figured I might as well give it a try.  At this point it's resting at my number two spot of favorite films of that year, `The Pianist' just barely squeezing in front of it.What was most surprising to me was not the fact that the plot intrigued me or that the film entertained me but was the fact that Nicolas Cage blew me away.  As twin's Charlie and Donald Kaufman, Cage completely develops two completely different characters, embodying each of their personality traits to the full.  He's at one moment reserved and disclosed, nervous and insecure and in the next he's funny and outgoing, confident and hapless.  That takes true talent, and with this role Cage proved he had it.As Charlie, Cage plays a fictional version of the screenwriter himself who has been asked to adapt bestseller `The Orchid Thief' into a script.  He's immediately flattered that he was approached with the assignment but he's soon overwhelmed and frustrated with the mere fact that the novel has almost no plot and thus wouldn't be able to satisfy the viewing public.  He's also increasingly annoyed with his twin Donald's newfound desire and supposed niche for screenwriting as well and his compulsive and relentless badgering is beginning to wear thin on Charlie's patience and sanity.Meryl Streep is also fantastic, as usual, in flashbacks as Susan Orlean, the writer of the novel.  As Charlie contemplates the direction the film would take we see Susan in her adventures with `the orchid thief' himself John Laroche (Chris Cooper in his Oscar winning role), as she slowly falls in love with him and his line of work.  It's not really until the end though that Meryl starts to stun me once again with her brilliant character development and utter ability to transform herself into someone she's never been before.  She was cunning, stunning, breathtaking, heartbreaking and somewhat insane within seconds of each other.With great supporting performances by a long list of great actors and actresses including Tilda Swinton, Ron Livingston, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Brian Cox, `Adaptation' sits nicely on the shelf of great films that I won't soon forget and will be one that I recommend and enjoy for a long time to come.

It is the adaptation of ""The Orchid Thief,"" a novel by Susan Orlean, but it is actually a film about the adaptation of the novel. It chronicles the fictitious events of Charlie Kaufman trying to adapt the novel into the movie, thus creating this movie. In essence: ""Adaptation"" is about the making of ""Adaptation.""In a way, it can be viewed as an infinite, as movie within movie begets another movie within that, and so on. It's really incredible to think about, and at the same time, it does cover some of the material of the book, talking about the history of orchid thievery very briefly, along with the relations between Susan Orleane and LaRoche continuing as being read from the book by Charlie.Charlie truly struggles with the source material, wanting to stay true to it, and yet finding no substance with which to create a plot, using a book review as a source for this decision. The merging of the script and reality is interesting, and it makes it more interesting that Charlie wavers in and out of reality in the movie with his ideas of what to put in the script, which are then shown in the script, which are then in the movie, to be put in the script, etc.Also plaguing Charlie is his brother David, determined to be a successful screenwriter like his brother, yet bumbling through impossibilities that would only work in a non-adapted book, only to stumble upon success while Charlie continues to struggle (in fact, the premise for David's screenplay seems to be loosely used in the film ""Identity."") In reality, David helped Charlie with this script, but the movie alters things (I suppose each wrote their own personalities.)One problem with the two (both played by Nicholas Cage) is that while David's constant hounding of Charlie makes the viewer feel uncomfortable, David is also one of the only characters the viewer can care about (though what happens to LaRoche before the beginning is pretty tragic.) David is also the main source of comic relief, and some of his lines and analyses are really funny. This makes Charlie unlikable, as in every moment he is criticizing David, it makes his own loathing for himself (professed at the start) to be all the more necessary.Some have viewed the movie's ending as problematic, stating it tacks onto the book, and it also is too ""Hollywood"" for an otherwise forwardly off-key film. In a sense, both of these accusations are true, and done for a reason. The point of Charlie's dilemma is that he can eventually come to his own conclusion, and because Susan Orleane is a character in the workings for the script, it's necessary to conclude things after the end of the book. As for the Hollywoodness of it, that's Charlie's own stab at himself, as well as a wit of irony towards he as a character. In the beginning, he states that he wants to make a movie about flowers, not about all the various things typically added to a Hollywood movie (drugs, gun, car chases, etc.) It works, as the movie turns into exactly what he didn't want it to be, and I find it strange that anyone would complain about the intriguing idea.""Adaptation"" is a strange film, and granted, many people won't understand it or will find it boring.

Charlie Kaufman (Nicholos Cage) is a sweating, overweight screenwriter prone to voice-overs and fantasy.  Given the coveted job of writing an adaptation of Susan Orlean's THE ORCHID THIEF, he struggles mightily with his art and the downturn of his personal life, which is also desperately in need of adaptation.  When his twin brother Donald (also Cage), the archetypical mooch, decides on a whim that he, too, will become a screenwriter, Charlie is pushed to the edge.  The movie begins to twist on itself, showing scenes from the story of ""The Orchid Thief"", Charlie's struggle with it, and, most comically, Charlie and Donald's head-banging exchanges about writing screenplays.  It soon becomes evident that we are watching the finished screenplay of Charlie's (and Donald's) adaptations, with all its quirks and dramatic license.Cage makes the real screenwriter Charlie Kaufman hilariously pathetic, and argues with his wide-eyed (and thinner) alter ego with equally comedic success. Meryl Streep is great in the role of Susan Orlean, especially as she takes her character from Charlie's to Donald's genre.  Chris Cooper is incredible as LaRoche, the charming but strange orchid thief himself; I had to keep reminding myself that he was an actor and not the real-life Laroche himself.Viewers who enjoy the type of weird ride that the screenwriter/director combo of Kaufman and Jonze (""Being John Malkovich"") provide will find it hilariously clever; others will be left shaking their heads.

Hahn ""dhwwolfe""","[5, 6]","This film is going to garner a lot of comparison to 8 1/2 and deservedly so, it's among the few movies about movies that morphs into what it is actually attempting to deconstruct, comment on, whatever.  8 1/2 is a sort of meandering film that splits it's time between the protagonist director's (Fellini's) thoughts on women and on the movie within the movie that we're watching and likewise, Adaptation gives us an epic human story within what is essentially an inside joke.  Hollywood types, screenwriters and more importantly aspiring screenwriters will get all the jokes and laugh to themselves at Brian Cox's brilliant portrayal of Robert McKee, but what this movie does is change, unlike 8 1/2 which always sort of feels like it is aware of what it is (it's smart, it's witty, it's self aware because the genre requires it).  Adaptation makes a point of not knowing where it's going, not knowing what it's about, but staying true to the human elements the director and writer have worked into the film.  These are what we hold onto as the story starts to become what it seems to abhor (an erotic, action, suspense film).  What's amazing about Adaptation is that the cliches built into the movie, the cliches that are supposed to make fun of the Hollywood process and the people, actually come off as genuine because of the honesty of the characters.People are put off by the ending, the car accident, the action, but even 8 1/2 embraced the sort of spectacle of movie endings with the space shuttle and the party with all the returning characters.  These elements are what writers and directors have been working with since the beginning of movies.  The lonely writer, the split screen twin brother story, the eccentric hick, the drug mystery, the sappy dying last words, three act sturcture, reversal of expectations, big ending.

I'm no fan of  Nicholas Cage (who I think is vastly-overrated, overly-mannered and tremendously hammy), and I thought ""Being John Malkovitch"" was gimmicky and facile... But, boy! was I surprised by what screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and director Spike Jones came up with this time!The film's title refers less to biological evolution than intellectual, and specifically to the unique problems of writing a film script (or any work of art) based on a someone else's story.  How do you tell these stories?  And more importantly, how do you *sell* these stories, particularly when you want to tell them intelligently, and yet make your frat boy agent and the rest of the Hollywood studio system happy with your work. When this film opens, we see screenwriter Kaufman being ignored and shooed off the set of his last film -- he's so schlumpy and rumpled that no one on the crew gives him a second thought.  This time around, he places himself squarely in the action, as a brilliant but self-loathing artist, whose lofty principles and self-doubt conspire to produce a massive case of writer's block.  A fascinating project lands in his lap -- adapting an offbeat ""New Yorker"" article about renegade orchid farmers into a feature film script -- but he flounders as the project becomes a metaphor for his own yearnings for truth and beauty.  The script proceeds on several parallel tracks: Kaufman writing about the magazine journalist (played with good-natured abandon by Meryll Streep) who is in turn writing about an eccentric flower collector (played by Chris Cooper, one of the most underrated character actors in American cinema)... The story-within-a-story premise implodes and veers off the road as Kaufman proves to be an ingeniously unreliable narrator.  He pokes fun at Hollywood, the beast whose belly he inhabits, but in a gentle and affectionate way, rather than the heavy-handed hand biting of films like ""The Player"" and ""Time Code""... another welcome (and unexpected) change of pace.  The humor is fairly highbrow, but this is a movie that, once it finds its audience, is sure to keep 'em rolling with laughter.

When I came back two hours later from the bar, I asked her if she liked the movie.  ""No,"" she said, ""but I was glad I saw it.""  I spent the better part of a week trying to figure out what on God's green earth she meant by that.  How can you be glad to see a movie you didn't like?  Well, now that I've seen Adaptation, I know exactly what she meant.  Adaptation, like Moulin Rouge (and no, I didn't end up seeing it.  Some things I simply cannot do), is a movie that is eminently worth seeing without actually being good.Let me explain.  Sometimes you'll see a film and not like it, but you will want to have seen it, in order to engage yourself with it, to actually decide for yourself if it is lousy, or thought-provoking, or whatever (Note: this is not necessary with movies like ""Battlefield Earth"").  Adaptation has so many interesting things going for it: an intriguingly vain premise (that ends up falling apart), great performances, and deft comic touches, usually provided by the character Charlie Kaufman's inner thoughts.  But the movie ends up in the exact same place it seems determined not to go.  You watch it, thinking, ""Isn't this exactly what isn't supposed to be happening?""  And so, as a result, the last portion of the film rings false, in part because you anticipate it being some sick joke on the part of Kaufman the writer and director Spike Jonze.  But they end up playing it straight, which makes no sense at all.  Maybe that is the joke of it, but it's not exactly funny.There's another problem with Adaptation, and that is that Charlie Kaufman reaps what he sows.  He's invented a fictional twin brother as a real character in the film, but separating the two is almost impossible.  That is, you see the twin brother in the film, but you don't believe in him, because you know that he doesn't really exist.  It's that toying with fact and fiction that ultimately fails Adaptation at its emotional climax.  Because you never really buy any of it.  Or, at least, I didn't.Adaptation is certainly original, and it is different, but that ends up meaning little.  Because the story is so open structurally, it ends up not actually existing.  And that's a problem any writing course can teach you to fix.

Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[117, 130]","Spike Jonze's new movie, ""Adaptation,"" is a funny and entertaining look at insecure screenwriters, Hollywood hokum, and the lengths to which people will go to get what they want.Nicholas Cage is terrific in a dual role. He is Charlie Kaufman, a real-life screenwriter who has been commissioned to write the movie script for Susan Orlean's acclaimed novel, ""The Orchid Thief."" Unfortunately, Charlie has a monumental case of writer's block. He is also an insecure, nerdy guy who has trouble connecting with women and who is ashamed of his unkempt appearance. He is chubby and he wears a flannel shirt with the tails hanging out throughout much of the film. Cage also plays Charlie's twin brother, Donald, who is confidently writing a screenplay of his own. Donald's screenplay is formulaic and derivative, but he manages to sell it for a bundle. In addition, Donald has no trouble getting a beautiful woman to be his girlfriend.The conceit of ""Adaptation"" is that Charlie proceeds to write a screenplay about his inability to write a screenplay. There are hilarious vignettes with the wonderful Meryl Streep, who plays the writer, Susan Orlean, as a repressed journalist who is depressed because of a lack of passion in her life. Chris Cooper almost steals the movie as the eponymous orchid thief, a toothless, lowdown individual who somehow connects with Orlean.Jonze and Kaufman are making several statements here. They are saying that Hollywood is a place where desperate people will do anything to succeed, include writing formulaic potboilers. The way to survive is to adapt, to become whatever the public wants at the moment. You need to ""get with the program"" in order to succeed in Hollywood and in life.""Adaptation"" is also a movie about passion, about loving what you do, loving someone else, and loving life itself.

It was a brilliant, clever, original, hilarious, audacious movie that stood out in a year full of great movies. Three years later, came Adaptation from the same writer and director. Who would have guessed that with their follow-up, the Jonze-Kaufman team would manage to top Being John Malkovich? Yes, Adaptation is even more brilliant, clever, original, hilarious and audacious. If you're someone who appreciates those aspects, Adaptation will delight you to death. However, mainstream audiences will probably be left scratching their heads.Adaptation is an absolute joy of a film. The mastery of the possibilities of the arts of film and screenwriting that are on display here are positively exhilirating. Numerous times during this film, I just grinned from ear to ear at how clever and ingenious the film is. I really don't want to get into more detail. To describe the most brilliant aspects of the film beforehand would deprive part of the joy of seeing it. You really must see it for yourself.Charlie Kaufman has structured the film wonderfully. It manages to be so many things at the same time. It's an adaptation of Susan Orlean's book, it's a story of a frustrated screenwriter, it's a tale of hopes and obsession, and most importantly it's a giant in-joke at the expense of mainstream Hollywood. Comparisons to Fellini's 8 1/2 are not unfounded, and there are definite similarities, but I don't think that Adaptation is as personal a statement as 8 1/2. Charlie Kaufman is more interested in the potential of his screenwriting and seeing what he can accomplish with the unrelated stories of a screenwriter and a journalist.Having just recently seen the film a second time, I feel that I've gotten a bit more out of it than the first. Adaptation is a film that you really have to invest in. You have to really put some thought into it. It's certainly not a film that you can take at face value. It's a complex film, with layers of layers of subtext and demands to be seen more than once. With each viewing, you'll begin to understand it better and better.Nicolas Cage is wonderful here. His performance is completely convincing. You never doubt for a moment that there are really twins on screen together. Chris Cooper is excellent as John Laroche, probably the movie's most interesting character. I'm very pleased that he won the Oscar for this role.Adaptation must truly be one of the best films of 2002.

Cage plays himself and his twin brother (a technical virtuosity); together they are twice as painful to see as a single Cage would have been. Streep's part is so undemanding that it could have been played (equally well) by any one of a thousand aging actresses. There is nothing in the script that allows her to shine, and therefore the Academy awarded her an Oscar for best supporting performance.

604322,ACVNA57PI4DLV,B00005JLRE,Francois Tremblay,"[0, 1]","Adaptation springs from a real story - or more accurately, a real book called ""The Orchid Thief"". In that book, a New Yorker journalist details the adventures of an orchid thief called John Laroche. In the movie, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (a real screenwriter, who worked on Being John Malkovich, amongst other things) is assigned to write a script based on that book. Unfortunately, ""The Orchid Thief"" has little action, and he cannot find a good angle. We intercut between the past and the present, although the past and the narrative are, to a certain extent, created by Kaufman as he tries to figure out how to write the script.Are you following me ? Following Adaptation's narrative structure is a pleasure. Unfortunately, the story itself is rather mundane. We see Kaufman hit on some good or goofy ideas as he writes his screenplay (such as scenes with Charles Darwin writing his book, or a montage of all the stages of the evolution of species). But Kaufman himself is the clich&eacute; of the extremely neurotic professional, and much is made of his incapacity to talk to people.And this topped off with another stupid action ending, I'm afraid. I understand how it fits in the whole narrative, I just didn't care for it. In the end, an original structure is not worth much without good content to put in it, and this is a case that demands better.If you want to see this concept executed masterfully, I strongly encourage you to see 8 1/2, by Fellini. Heck, if you haven't seen 8 1/2 yet, go see it regardless !

604323,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B00005JLRE,General Zombie,"[5, 6]","I first saw 'Adaptation' around two years ago, and I felt that I had to deliberately hold off on reviewing it.  One of the major marks of a truly great film, for me anyway, is that I feel really blown away and just excited right after I finished watching, and I don't think a single other film has impressed me as much on the initial viewing as 'Adaptation'.  Interestingly enough, unlike most great films, I wasn't particularly more impressed after repeated viewings, but this may just be a testament to how well done 'Adaptation is.  As unusual as it is, it is written and directed with such clarity and force that it reveals almost all their is to know about it on a single viewing.'Adaptation' is notoriously impossible to synopsize, but  I'll give it a shot: 'Adaptation' is about Charlie Kaufman, an extraordinarily talented but utterly insecure screenwriter, and his attempts to write a screenplay for 'The Orchid Thief', a plotless nonfiction book about an eccentric, well, orchid thief named John Laroche.  The complications come from the extreme self-referential nature of the film: The screenplay that Kaufman is writing in the film is meant to be the screenplay of the film itself.  So the film is about itself, and its creation.  Of course, it is still a work of fiction, albeit inspired by Kaufman's own difficulties writing the film the blending of pseudo-reality and obvious fabrication is really very amusing, as is the nonlinear narrative where we move between the events of the book 'The Orchid Thief' and Kaufman's experience writing and various bits of random background and fantasy at various moments.  It's especially fun to see how the screenplay shapes itself, as at times we'll see a scene, and then learn about Kaufman's writing of it later, or we'll be able to trace how Charlie's thoughts in earlier scenes shape how later scenes play out.  Sadly, I've done a terrible job of describing the bizarre structure of the film.  Odds are, after reading this you still have no idea what the film is really like.  However, it is actually very easy to follow while your watching.Still, a clever setup like this isn't worth too much if you haven't got some intriguing characters and strong dialogue, both of which 'Adaptation' has in spades.  Charlie Kaufman takes center stage, naturally, and he's hopelessly neurotic and filled with doubt-- a true icon for all us introvert losers.  Nicolas Cage is absolutely brilliant as Charlie and his twin brother, Donald.  Donald is widely different from Charlie: He's not as smart, but he's also far less self-conscious and far more socially successful.  He's determined to be a screenwriter as well, though his ambitions are considerably lower than Charlie's, as he simply wants to write a formulaic, successful thriller.  (Donald's screenplay, 'The Three' is one of the funniest things in the film.  It's an absolutely spot-on and hilarious lampoon of the all too common big budget thriller.  Most amusingly, the central conceit of the screenplay is that it centers around a serial killer, the cop on his trail and the serial killer's current victim, ending with the revelation that they are, in fact, all the same person.  Charlie cannot fathom how this would work; indeed it wouldn't, and doesn't work, but no one else seems particularly interested in this fact.)  Laroche and Orlean are the other central pair in the film, the former a conceited redneck intellectual who's obsessed with plants while the latter is a conventional New York intellectual, and writer for the 'New Yorker'.  They have a similar relationship, in that Orlean tends to look down on Laroche, yet she is also impressed by and even jealous of how passionate and self-assured he is.  Laroche is one of the most unique characters I've ever come across in any film, and Chris Kooper's Oscar was well-deserved.  Kaufman is also very fair and evenhanded with his characters, as Donald and Laroche both prove to be more intelligent and observant than they first appeared, and in many ways just better people than their bohemian counterparts.The supporting players are excellent as well.  Brian Cox plays Robert McKee, a vulgar screenwriting workshop guru, whom Donald worships and Charlie loathes as a hack. (Though he eventually goes to seek him out at his most desperate moment.)  Cox's role is very small, but he manages to bring out perhaps the most memorable performance in the film. (He did the exact same thing in the previous year's `The Ring'.)  He is the true polar opposite of Charlie, as he is loud and forceful and accepts no nonsense whatsoever.  Finally, Ron Livingstone is very funny in a small role as Charlie's agent.And though the film has serious aspirations and is rather complex, it is still, at heart, a comedy, and a very funny one at that.  It's not always laugh out loud funny, no, but it frequently is, and is always very amusing.  It also has a strong human element.  Again, I'd naturally identify with Charlie, but Donald and Laroche both prove to be very likable as well, despite the fact that they initially appear to be the sorta people I'd naturally dislike.Spike Jonze's direction is as inspired as the writing.  Shooting this film would doubtless be a nightmare for a merely competent director as it requires remarkable versatility and really lacks a strong central thru line.  It needs to jump here and there and everywhere and still remain coherent.  With Jonze at the helm it goes well beyond coherent, and it a remarkably sharp and stylish film as well.This review is not going well.  What makes 'Adaptation' so remarkable is just about impossible to describe in words, and certainly too much for me to handle.  You've just gotta see it for yourself.  All the Charlie Kaufman penned films that I've seen are completely worthwhile (`Being John Malkovitch', `The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' and `Confessions of A Dangerous Mind') but Adaptation is easily the best of them, and is one of the greatest films of all-time.Grade: A",5,"One of the most memorable, ingenious films ever",1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,6006,"['first', 'saw',

It's pretentious, meandering, self-indulgent, self-referential -- everything that typifies post-modernist literature -- and plot-driven without a plot. But hate it I don't. I won't go so far as to say I love it, but I watched it intently and found myself defending it from a couple of people who thought it was ""boring and confusing"". It was not boring, to me at any rate, and not at all confusing. If anything, it might not have been confusing enough. The meta-meanings were awfully obvious.The premise of the un-plot is that screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has been hired to adapt a popular novel, The Orchid Thief by Susan Orlean, but suffers pathetic 'writer's block' over the task, eventually becoming obsessed with the author, whom he's never met, and stalking her until he discovers a shocking secret. Well now, Charlie Kaufman is the actual screenwriter of Adaptation but ""Charlie Kaufman"" is played in the film by Nicolas Gage, who also plays Charlie Kaufman's twin brother ""Donald"", while the real Donald Kaufman is given shared credit for the screenplay. Susan Orlean is a real writer for The New Yorker magazine and she really did write a book titled The Orchid Thief. In the film, she's played by Meryl Streep. Ms. Orlean has to be a very Good Sport about her work, since it is ""adapted"" with demonic abandon and portrays her in activities (imagined) that must have scandalized her colleagues and friends. The film's Charlie Kaufman is neurotic to the point of comedy, which is in fact the chief point of the comedy. His brother is utterly neurosis-clean but a bit of a dimwit. The focal character of Orlean's book is a shady Floridian misfit named John Laroche, the 'Orchid Thief' of the title. Laroche is perceived on three levels by the film audience: as he is described by Orlean in her book, as he appears in the film in flashbacks being interviewed by Orlean for the book, and as he is envisioned by Kaufman on the basis only of reading the book under adaptation. Yes, it is a set of Chinese Boxes, mirrors reflecting mirrors, a play within a play within a play ...... so why did I like it? For one thing, I expected it to be 'weird' and I almost knew I would like it. I sought it because I'd recently seen Charlie Kaufman's later movie ""Synecdoche New York"", which I considered the most interesting film of recent years. I'm working backwards through Kaufman's oeuvre. ""Adaptation"" isn't as good as ""Synecdoche New York"". In fact, it seems almost like a practice piece for the later film. But it's ambitious. AMBITIOUS! Precisely what most films, especially American film, are not. Its ambitions outweigh its pretensions. Also, the acting is incredibly good. Meryl Streep plays Susan Orlean as the evolving character the plot/unplot requires. Chris Cooper is perfect as Laroche; he's exactly the same person no matter who is perceiving him, and that person is as real as table salt. Nicolas Gage? Frankly, I didn't think the man could act at all. I thought he was one of those Hollywood icons who played the same guy, himself, in every film. Ho boy, he surprised me. In Adaptation he plays two guys, the two Kaufmans, side-by-side with totally different affect, plausibly distinct personalities. Even their sitting postures are distinguishable. The real Donald Kaufman, by the by, must be another Good Sport, considering what happens to his counterpart in the movie.This is an intelligent movie, a movie for intellectual cinema fans.

Sometimes it was the book's fault, &#34;Under The Tuscan Sun&#34; and &#34;Eat Pray Love&#34; being two good examples of books that had to be changed to make a watchable movie---I mean, how much could you stand of Elizabeth Gilbert whining about how she's not indulging herself nearly enough?  Lots of famous writers went to Hollywood too, often having no more luck than their Broadway hits and bestsellers, once they arrived.&#34;Adaptation&#34; is about a writer, already struggling with himself, who gets the job of adapting a story, about a Florida orchid poacher, that started out as a New Yorker piece (much like &#34;Brokeback Mountain&#34;) and who becomes the focus of the movie as he changes the story into a film by adding lots of stuff to it, and making its author into one of its characters.  And all of that in between him whining and fussing about as much as Elizabeth Gilbert in her book, but not nearly as well expressed.I'm not sure on which level the climax of the film takes place---in the real life of the movie, or in the story the writer is putting together, but since it involves real people from our side of the screen, played as &#34;real&#34; people on that side of the screen, who are by then, characters in his screenplay as well, it all comes out rather odd, like your whites after you forgot to separate the red shirt.By the time I got there I had lost interest.  I like Nicholas Cage, but playing a self loathing twit of a writer as he does here, is hardly a sympathetic portrayal that is aimed at getting the audience's support, and much of the movie is about him, struggling with himself, whining, whining, whining...  After a while you just want to smack him.  Tell him to get it together.

Adaptation took me on a journey that in parts, twisted me up, messed with my head, and then all made sense, only to be completely thrown for a loop again multiple times!  What I'm saying is, just when I thought this movie was making a complete story, something else would happen that I'd completely not expect.  A true gem of a film, Adaptation is best described as a movie that shows the struggles of making that very film.  Charlie Kaufman (who wrote the screenplay) is played by Nic Cage.  In the movie, Charlie has a brother Donaled (also played by Cage) who looks up to Charlie and admires his writing talents.  Yet Charlie is suffering severely from trying to write his new screenplay which is an adapation of the book The Orchid Thief by Susan Orlean.  Well, that's what the movie is about, an adaptation of that book.  Are you confused yet?Whereas Charlie hates wanting to write the formulaic screenplay that will sell well as it appeals to the John Q Public movie viewer, Donald takes that very path by taking a generic screenplay writing course and having ideas that all have been used before but sell.  This annoys Charlie beyond belief and to make matters worse, Donald is able to sell his script while Charlie still struggles.In Charlie's adaptation of the book, he begins to truly admire Susan but yet refuses to meet her fearing the expectations she might put on him for adapting her book into a film.  What Charlie doesn't know is Susan's real life that through the help of Donald, he finally understands....but that's when everything goes awry.Believe me, it's really hard to try to describe this film.  However it's well worth watching b/c really what it does it makes fun of the Industry in so many ways.  It's a film for movie goers who hate the generic films that our out there that do well only b/c most of the general public doesn't really want to see anything that makes you think.  This is especially common right now b/c it's January.If you do not fall into this category, you need to see this film!  It's like a rollercoaster ride with phenomenal acting on various levels.If you're a writer you should see b/c no doubt you'll relate to the struggles writers go through and might find this an inspiration for you.If you liked Being John Malkovich you have to see this film.I could go on but I won't....trying hard not to giveaway anything that would ruin it for you...please, enjoy this one as one of those rare films Hollywood puts out that sheds light on an industry that really only caters to the mass-viewing easy-to-please public w/out caring about ""smart"" films.",5,best and most unique movie of 2002!,1043452800,"01 25, 2003",2003,2633,"['Gosh', 'where', 'do', 'begin', 'one', 'Adaptation', 'took', 'journey', 'parts', 'twisted', 'up', 'messed', 'head', 'then', 'made', 'sense', 'only', 'be', 'completely', 'thrown', 'loop', 'again', 'multiple', 'times', 'What', ""'m"", 'saying', 'just', 'when', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'making', 'complete', 'story', 'something', 'else', 'would', 'happen', ""'d"", 'completely', 'not', 'expect', 'true', 'gem', 'film', 'Adaptation', 'best', 'described', 'movie', 'struggles', 'making', 'very', 'film', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'played', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'movie', 'Charlie', 'brother', 'Donaled', 'also', 'played', 'Cage', 'who', 'up', 'Charlie', 'writing', 'talents', 'Charlie', 'suffering', 'severely', 'trying', 'write', 'new', 'screenplay', 'adapation', 'book', 'Orchid', 'Thief', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'Well', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'adaptation', 'book', 'Are', 'confused', 'yet', 'Whereas', 'Charlie', 'wanting', 'write', 'formulaic', 'screenplay', 'will', 'sell', 'well', 'appeals', 'John', 'Q', 'Public', 'movie', 'viewer', 'Donald', 'very', 'path', 'taking', 'generic', 'screenplay', 'writing', 'course', 'having', 'ideas', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'sell', 'Charlie', 'belief', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Donald', 'able', 'sell', 'script', 'Charlie', 'still', 'Charlie', 'adaptation', 'book', 'truly', 'admire', 'Susan', 'yet', 'meet', 'fearing', 'expectations', 'might', 'put', 'adapting', 'book', 'film', 'What', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'know', 'Susan', 'real', 'life', 'help', 'Donald', 'finally', 'when', 'everything', 'awry.Believe', 'really', 'hard', 'try', 'describe', 'film', 'However', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'b/c', 'really', 'what', 'fun', 'Industry', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'movie', 'goers', 'who', 'hate', 'generic', 'films', 'there', 'do', 'well', 'only', 'most', 'general', 'public', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'see', 'anything', 'think', 'especially', 'common', 'right', 'now', 'January.If', 'do', 'not', 'fall', 'category', 'need', 'see', 'film', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'phenomenal', 'acting', 'various', 'levels.If', ""'re"", 'writer', 'should', 'see', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'relate', 'struggles', 'writers', 'go', 'might', 'find', 'inspiration', 'you.If', 'liked', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'have', 'see', 'film.I', 'could', 'go', 'wo', ""n't"", '.trying', 'hard', 'not', 'giveaway', 'anything', 'would', 'ruin', 'please', 'enjoy', 'one', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'Hollywood', 'out', 'sheds', 'light', 'industry', 'really', 'only', 'caters', 'mass-viewing', 'easy-to-please', 'public', 'caring', 'smart', 'films']",N/A

604341,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B00005JLRE,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[2, 3]","Charlie Kaufman (Nicolas Cage) is trying to adapt the book The Orchid Thief from Susan Orleans (Meryl Streep) about John La Roche (Chris Cooper) who goes to various places in Miami to find orchids to cultivate, but doesn't want to add much to the actual story. Because of this he's having a hard time adapting the book to movie form. He's also living with his brother Donald (Nicolas Cage) who has decided that he will become a screenwriter and is working on a screenplay about serial killers called ""The Three"".Charlie Kaufman (yes, that's a real person) is a brilliant screenwriter. Having written the little seen Human Nature, the quirky Being John Malkovich, and the critically acclaimed and brilliant Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Charlie was trying to come up with something new with his adaptation of Susan Orleans' book The Orchid Thief. He was having a very difficult time with adapting the book the way he wanted, but eventually came up with this idea to meld real life with fiction with a little help from his (fictional) brother, Donald Kaufman (who also earned a co-screenwriting credit).Adaptation is a brilliant film, as are most of Kaufman's works, melding together his real world works at adapting The Orchid Thief with the fictional account seemlessly. Throughout the film you get that this is a true story, especially when you review to realize that the character names are names of real people (with very few exceptions, such as Donald Kaufman), and then at the end, once you realize that this is a work of fiction, you can still see the work of Donald Kaufman on the film as if Charlie was channeling the character's ambitions in an effort to figure out how to end the movie. Naturally, in the end, when you find out more about the movie this only works to the story's advantage.Nicolas Cage isn't typically the actor that you'd look to to portray a character like this, or I should say, character's like this. Charlie and Donald are two totally different characters with separate sensibilities, but Nic plays them with amazing affinity for the shortcomings and strengths of the characters. Naturally, Oscar winning actress Meryl Streep throws herself fully into the game as always, and you also have a dose of the amazing Brian Cox, which is always worth noting. Chris Cooper as the eccentric orchid thief John La Roche steals the show though.This is a movie that I have to highly recommend. It's funny and stylish but doesn't lose it's focus on story and character building. The movie does a great job at remaining faithful to the material Charlie was originally trying to adapt by focusing some of the attention and narration on passages of the book, while also remaining entertaining, especially in the relationship between the two brothers.

Nicolas Cage, Chris Cooper, and Meryl Streep all do a great job and bring it together into one coherent (sort-of) ending.The movie is about the process of writing a screenplay from another source, but turns into an examination of the creative process, and how it relates to the creators (writers). Nicolas Cage plays the inhibited, smart, unhappy screenwriter Charlie Kaufmann, who is charged with turning ""The Orchid Thief"" into a film. He also plays Charlie's identical twin brother, Donald, who is everything Charlie is not, but also aspires to be a screenwriter. Charlie Kaufmann, btw, is the real writer of ""Adaptation,"" but it is credited to both him and Donald (who is a character in the film, and not a real person).  In fact the film is dedicated to Donald (Donald Kaufmann, btw, also has an entry in IMDB as a screenwriter).Also writing is Susan Orlean (played by Meryl Streep), whose book ""The Orchard Thief"" Charlie is working to adapt for film. Susan has her own struggles with the creative process. The focus for all this creative energy is LaRoche, the Orchid Thief of the title, whose obsession with collecting orchids is at the heart of the movie. I think it is pretty interesting how LaRoche is the character who feels the most strongly about his passion, while the two writers circle around him and try to find something in their own lives they feel strongly about. Chris Cooper is completely convincing as LaRoche, and it is a relief to see him playing something besides a government bureaucrat or a military officer.I laughed a lot at the scenes where Charlie attends a seminar on screenwriting. I actually use some of the ""tips"" to judge movies (for examle, never ever use a voiceover ...)Although I had fun watching this movie, I am not sure that I would call it a really good movie (definitely not a great movie). Behind all the amusing connections and intricate story lines, I am just not sure that there is all that much there.

Sad, middle-aged female magazine writers seeking fulfillment in their barren lives.  Copycat twin screenwriters, one that  obsesses over an unattainable woman.  And too many writers fouling the broth...You gotta figure that if Charlie Kaufman is involved, self-celebration (inserting himself as twin Kaufmans in a screenplay based on a book written by someone else) will be the main course.  Wasn't Kaufman the same guy who envisioned and penned 'Being John Malkovich?' It seems he's not quite comfortable just 'Being Charlie Kaufman'.  He succeeds in celebrating the self on a few different levels, but not to the ultimate benefit of the film.  Perhaps his purpose is to live vicariously through his characters' characters.  They called that stuff 'cosmic duality' in the Modern Lit classes in college, but I think that was just a fancy name for a masturbatory act of the writer's ego.I felt used by the Kaufman brothers and their 'duality' artifice; too distracted by the novelty of the character concentrics and plot twists to wonder what exactly was their relationship.  Like a conman's pigeon, I got pulled in all the way, curious to see things play out.  Except that at film's end I was consumed by the need to have a shower; to scrub my skin until I was clean again.I  was lured also by the Meryl Streep character, down the slow-moving, fetid swamp where The Orchid lies.  Once there I became isolated and abandoned, discovering that she-- like so many people in real life-- first captivated me and later disgusted me with the choices she made and the person she had become.Chris Cooper deserved the 2003 Best Supporting Oscar for his performance as the complex, yet simple Peter Pan who never-growed-up.  I found it fascinating that the choices he made in his Life appeared cryptic --until he explained how he arrived at them.A real challenge for the screenwriter would be to conjure up  a sequel.

So many things are going on and the film does not follow a simple plot structure.  We have Nicolas Cage playing Charlie Kaufman (the real life screenwriter of Adaptation and Being John Malkovich).  Charlie Kaufman is adapting a screenplay from Susan Orlean's book The Orchid Thief.  Kaufman is struggling with this adaptation and discusses this with his brother Donald (also played by Cage).  But here's the rub: Donald Kaufman does not exist.  He is a figment of Charlie's imagination.  Donald is at work on a screenplay, but a more conventionally Hollywood screenplay.  We see Charlie begin to write himself into the screenplay he is working on (and that we are watching).  This is one part of the movie and is interspersed throughout the film.In other parts of the movie, Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) is researching and writing her book ""The Orchid Thief"".  She meets and listens to the stories told by her subject, Laroche (Chris Cooper).  She accompanies Laroche as he hunts for his passion: a rare orchid that is only able to be found in the swamps of Florida.It seems that the scenes with Orlean are what Kaufman is writing into his screenplay, but Charlie is unable to keep his own life (and Donald's) out of the screenplay as well.  What I had expected to be an adaptation of The Orchid Thief is, in fact, an account of adapting the Orchid Thief.But there is more.  If you look at the credits, you see that Donald Kaufman is credited as a screenwriter for Adaptation.  Considering he is a fictional character, this is rather strange (stranger still that the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences maintained the fiction in the film and nominated Donald along with Charlie Kaufman for an Oscar for the screenplay).  This actually works, though.  When watching the movie, pay attention to the scenes involving Donald Kaufman and the screenplay that he is trying to write.  This is more important than you might think and may help you to ""get"" the joke/twist the movie throws at you near the end.Even though repeat viewing would give me a greater understanding of the film, this isn't something that I think I want to watch over and over again.  Is Adaptation a good movie?  Yes.  Was it worthy of all the awards it won? Yes.  Did I like it?  Again, yes.  It is also not the type of movie that I would watch over and over again.

604348,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,B00005JLRE,"John ""MovieAddict""","[4, 8]","For me to call a film a masterpiece, it must a) bend my mind, b) invigorate me, c) offer something original, but most of all, it's just gotta entertain me like no film ever has before.There are certain films I call masterpieces. ""Goodfellas,"" ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles,"" ""Back to the Future,"" ""The Terminator,""  ""Jaws,"" ""It's a Wonderful Life"": I know those films aren't what one would typically have on their lists of the greatest films ever. But I didn't say the greatest films ever. I said masterpieces. And while those films are on my greatest films ever list, without a doubt, I also call them masterpieces. ""Goodfellas"" is one of the best dramas ever. ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" is not only my favorite comedy, but a deeply sentimental and touching one, too. ""Back to the Future"" is not only one of the most re-watchable films ever (next to ""Planes...""), but is also highly entertaining AND extremely thought-provoking. ""The Terminator"" is thought-provoking, but menacing and fear-packed. ""Jaws"" is a cleverly-built, well-oiled scare machine. And ""It's a Wonderful Life""...well...no explanation necessary.So it kind of busts my chops when a film comes out and everyone calls it an instant masterpiece. Because while there are the instant masterpieces, I truly believe people are too open to admitting a film is a masterpiece, without really examining the film itself. Take 1999's smash hit ""Being John Malkovich,"" about a nerd (John Cusack) finding a portal into actor John Malkovich's mind. Original, no doubt. But for me, it just didn't do anything. Some films seem to be original simply for that purpose, and nothing else. That's how I woul define ""Being John Malkovich.""The film was written by Charlie Kaufman, a quiet, non-social creature who ""Kaufs"" up scripts for movies that are original. His latest journey, ""Adaptation,"" is a real mind-boggler. Try to get this all down...Charlie Kaufman is given the chance to turn Susan Orlean's book ""The Orchid Thief"" into a major motion picture. The only problem is that the novel has no plot. It is simply about flowers, and nothing else. Kaufman just cannot find meaning in the chaos. He eventually gets way behind schedule on the project, and realizes that in an effort to create a plot, he has just written himself into the story. He has written a story about himself trying to find a plot in the chaos. As his fictional-in-real-life twin brother Donald says, ""That's kinda weird, isn't it?""And what is so weird is that on-screen, we see Charlie Kaufman writing about himself. But in real life, Charlie Kaufman was writing about Charlie Kaufman writing about Charlie Kaufman. It's like taking two mirrors, lining them opposite each other, and standing something in the middle, having that something cast a reflection in a mirror, which would then, in turn, reflect the image into the other mirror, which in turn casts that image into the mirror it originated from, forever and ever.In the film ""Adaptation,"" Nicolas Cage plays Charlie Kaufman. And one of the confusing things about this movie is that you cannot seperate fiction from non-fiction. I've never heard of a novel named ""The Orchid Field."" Does it really exist? Is Susan Orlean a real, living being? Was Kaufman really trying to write about her story, and in turn wrote himself in when he developed Writer's Block? Well, yes, she is real. I'll have to get back to you on the other question.To be honest, the film is  quite odd and fun to watch, until the very end, in which everything suddenly goes haywire. As in ""Malkovich,"" the characters suddenly become crazy. The author Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) and her no-toothed lover (Chris Cooper) start to try and kill Kaufman. Throughout the entire film, Orlean was a normal being, with emotions, and she did realistic things. But right at the end, she becomes some crazy killer bent on destroying Kaufman.But the ending seems more justified than that of ""Malkovich."" In ""Being John Malkovich,"" the characters suddenly just get weird; I thought it was pathetic, and ruined the whole movie. But in ""Adaptation,"" Kaufman attends a screenwriting class, where Kaufman complains that voice-over narratives must be used in films without a plot (""The Orchid Field). A man named Bob tells Kaufman, ""What, you don't think life is exciting on its own?"" So, in some way or another, the ending symbalizes the fact that Kaufman realizes how exciting life is. Throughout the entire film everything is normal, but when Bob tells him life is exciting, he starts to see that things really are exciting, i.e. the author trying to kill Kaufman.So no matter how bad the ending to this film was, it was more dignified and justified than that in ""Malkovich,"" and if you can accept that, I think the rest of the movie - though at times odd - is worth seeing. A definite improvement over ""Being John Malkovich.""",3,Being Charlie Kaufman,1057708800,"07 9, 2003",2003,4866,"['call', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'must', 'bend', 'mind', 'b', 'invigorate', 'c', 'offer', 'something', 'original', 'most', 'just', 'got', 'ta', 'entertain', 'film', 'ever', 'before.There', 'are', 'certain', 'films', 'call', 'masterpieces', 'Goodfellas', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'Back', 'Future', 'Terminator', 'Jaws', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'know', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', 'one', 'would', 'typically', 'have', 'lists', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'said', 'masterpieces', 'films', 'are', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'list', 'doubt', 'also', 'call', 'masterpieces', 'Goodfellas', 'one', 'best', 'dramas', 'ever', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'not', 'only', 'favorite', 'comedy', 'deeply', 'sentimental', 'touching', 'one', 'too', 'Back', 'Future', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'most', 're-watchable', 'films', 'ever', 'next', 'Planes', 'also', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'AND', 'extremely', 'thought-provoking', 'Terminator', 'thought-provoking', 'menacing', 'fear-packed', 'Jaws', 'cleverly-built', 'well-oiled', 'scare', 'machine', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'well', 'explanation', 'kind', 'busts', 'chops', 'when', 'film', 'out', 'everyone', 'instant', 'masterpiece', 'are', 'instant', 'masterpieces', 'truly', 'believe', 'people', 'are', 'too', 'open', 'admitting', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'really', 'examining', 'film', 'Take', '1999', 'smash', 'hit', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'nerd', 'John', 'Cusack', 'finding', 'portal', 'actor', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'mind', 'Original', 'doubt', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'films', 'seem', 'be', 'original', 'simply', 'purpose', 'nothing', 'else', 'how', 'woul', 'define', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'quiet', 'non-social', 'creature', 'who', 'Kaufs', 'up', 'scripts', 'movies', 'are', 'original', 'latest', 'journey', 'Adaptation', 'real', 'mind-boggler', 'Try', 'get', 'down', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'given', 'chance', 'turn', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'book', 'Orchid', 'Thief', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'only', 'problem', 'novel', 'plot', 'simply', 'flowers', 'nothing', 'else', 'Kaufman', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'meaning', 'chaos', 'eventually', 'way', 'schedule', 'project', 'effort', 'create', 'plot', 'just', 'written', 'story', 'written', 'story', 'trying', 'find', 'plot', 'chaos', 'fictional-in-real-life', 'twin', 'brother', 'Donald', 'kinda', 'weird', ""n't"", 'what', 'so', 'weird', 'on-screen', 'see', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'writing', 'real', 'life', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'was', 'writing', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'writing', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'taking', 'two', 'mirrors', 'lining', 'opposite', 'other', 'standing', 'something', 'middle', 'having', 'something', 'cast', 'reflection', 'mirror', 'would', 'then', 'turn', 'reflect', 'image', 'other', 'mirror', 'turn', 'casts', 'image', 'mirror', 'originated', 'forever', 'ever.In', 'film', 'Adaptation', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'one', 'confusing', 'things', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'seperate', 'fiction', 'non-fiction', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'novel', 'named', 'Orchid', 'Field', 'really', 'exist', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'real', 'living', 'being', 'Was', 'Kaufman', 'really', 'trying', 'write', 'story', 'turn', 'wrote', 'when', 'developed', 'Writer', 'Block', 'Well', 'yes', 'real', ""'ll"", 'have', 'get', 'back', 'other', 'question.To', 'be', 'honest', 'film', 'quite', 'odd', 'fun', 'watch', 'very', 'end', 'everything', 'suddenly', 'haywire', 'Malkovich', 'characters', 'suddenly', 'become', 'crazy', 'author', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'no-toothed', 'lover', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'start', 'try', 'kill', 'Kaufman', 'entire', 'film', 'Orlean', 'was', 'normal', 'being', 'emotions', 'did', 'realistic', 'things', 'right', 'end', 'crazy', 'killer', 'bent', 'destroying', 'Kaufman.But', 'ending', 'more', 'justified', 'Malkovich', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'characters', 'suddenly', 'just', 'get', 'weird', 'thought', 'was', 'pathetic', 'ruined', 'whole', 'movie', 'Adaptation', 'Kaufman', 'screenwriting', 'class', 'where', 'Kaufman', 'voice-over', 'narratives', 'must', 'be', 'used', 'films', 'plot', 'Orchid', 'Field', 'man', 'named', 'Bob', 'Kaufman', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'life', 'exciting', 'own', 'So', 'way', 'ending', 'fact', 'Kaufman', 'how', 'exciting', 'life', 'entire', 'film', 'everything', 'normal', 'when', 'Bob', 'life', 'exciting', 'see', 'things', 'really', 'are', 'exciting', 'i.e', 'author', 'trying', 'kill', 'Kaufman.So', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'ending', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'more', 'dignified', 'justified', 'Malkovich', 'can', 'accept', 'think', 'rest', 'movie', 'though', 'times', 'odd', 'worth', 'seeing', 'definite', 'improvement', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich']",N/A

604351,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00005JLRE,Joseph Haschka,"[13, 21]","In ADAPTATION, the audience views sequences from alternating storylines, one from the present and one 3-years past, until both converge at the film's conclusion.In the ""past"", New York journalist Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) is researching a story, eventually to become the book ""The Orchid Thief"", about John Laroche (Chris Cooper), whose passion is collecting endangered species of orchids to serve as nursery stock. Actually, he poaches them from protected nature preserves in the south Florida swamps. But, since he has Native Americans indigenous to the region doing the picking, his operation is legally untouchable under an arcane interpretation of the law.In the ""present"", Nicolas Cage plays the dual roles of Charlie Kaufman and his identical twin Donald. Charlie is the accomplished screenwriter adapting ""The Orchid Thief"" to the Silver Screen.  Donald also wants to be a screenwriter, and is in the process of authoring his first script. Charlie is handicapped by a severe lack of self esteem, which is exacerbated by his inability to find the muse for his current assignment as well a his failure to establish a relationship with a woman. It doesn't help that he shares a roof with Donald, his complete opposite. Donald is self-assured, successful with the ladies, and positively gushing with creative juices as he writes his initial screenplay.Without the use of any special make-up tricks, each of the Kaufman twins is instantly recognizable by the viewer. Cage manages this differentiation with an acting performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. Charlie's gloom is consistently marked by the downturned corners of his mouth and a general hangdog look. He's Major Downer personified. On the other hand, Donald's optimistic ebullience is signaled by the upturned corners of his mouth and the twinkle in his eyes. Obviously there's more to it than this - you have to see it.Cooper is wonderful as the Southern cracker stereotype - ball-capped, toothless, long-haired and street smart - whose life has been a sequential series of passionate obsessions. Streep is (initially) enigmatic as Orlean, whose sterile marriage and professional life has her desperately seeking passion of any sort. At the film's conclusion, when all four personalities collide in the Florida swamps, passion erupts to heights hitherto undreamed of by the characters or the audience.ADAPTATION is undeniably clever, since its perspective comes from the screenwriter (Charlie) whose painfully evolving screenplay becomes the movie you're watching. I liked that. However, the two storylines seemed excessively contrived and joined to make a point. And what is the point? According to Sony Pictures, the film's theme is the passion that each of us longs for in life. Or perhaps it's indicated by something Donald says late in the movie, ""You are what you love, not what loves you."" To me, these are such obvious attributes of life and living as to comprise an unnecessary dedication of two hours of run time.I walked out of the theater admiring this film, especially Cage's performance(s), more than being swept away by it.

604354,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00005JLRE,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 3]","Re-teaming withBeing John Malkovichdirector Spike Jonze, Charlie Kaufman penned the script for Adaptation. What began as Kaufman adapting the bookThe Orchid Thief: A True Story of Beauty and Obsession (Ballantine Reader's Circle)turned into something much more complicated resulting in a rewarding film which has been underrated by audiences since it's release.Nicolas Cage, in an Oscar-nominated performance, plays nervous, self-loathing, and socially awkward screenwriter Charlie Kaufman. After his success with Being John Malkovich, Charlie is asked to adapt the Susan Orlean book The Orchid Thief. Problem is, Charlie doesn't know how to adapt it.Meanwhile, we see the origins of the book as Susan (Meryl Streep) meets John Laroche (Chris Cooper, who won an Oscar for his role). Laroche, who's missing his two front teeth, is a plant enthusiast who uses his indian friends to help him poach endangered flowers. In meeting Laroche, Susan is awakened to her own unhappiness.Cage also plays Kaufman's twin brother Donald (also co-writer of the script, despite not being a real person), well-liked and functional in social circles, who is trying to become a screenwriter like his brother.Make no mistake, this is a complicated story with a genius writer at the helm. Despite being a tale of writer's black, Kaufman effortlessly blurs the line between reality and fiction. Jonze knows his way around a Kaufman script and handles all of it splendidly.The acting is what really drives the piece. Cage is an underrated actor, but here he's given a chance to really flaunt his versatility. Playing both Charlie and Donald, who are identical but have little in common beyond that, could not have been easy but Cage really establishes them as separate people. You can tell which one's which due to body language and vocal cadence. This is a really layered performance. Anyone who is under the impression that Cage isn't a good actor (you know who you are) needs to see this film.Cooper is a revelation. Nearly unrecognizable beneath long hair and the gap in his mouth, he's fascinating. This performance was not written as Oscar-bait, but Cooper certainly earned it.Adaptation features many cameos by other recognizable actor's and everyone is solid. The film too is a rich, textured, unique piece of filmmaking that will both entertain and enlighten. This film made many top 10 lists upon it's release but has received only lukewarm reactions from filmgoers. In truth, this is one of Kaufman's best screenplays. A great film, Adaptation deserves more of an audience.

The idea of mauling a New Yorker &quot;This story is really about me&quot; essay is brilliant, but... Well, several people mentioned the Coens, and that's the failing right there: it comes nowhere near to their level of inspired lunacy. We're promised a good trashing, and it just doesn't happen.Instead we get what seems like hours of staring at Charlie Kaufmann's misery and angst, much of which is played straight. And when we finally switch to &quot;Donald&quot; mode for the last half-hour ...that's done with a straight face too, exactly as if it was a cheapo made-for-TV thriller and nothing more.

604357,A2NBOL825B93OM,B00005JLRE,J R Zullo,"[0, 4]","Adaptation has two plots, that, obviously, get together in the end: first, New Yorker writer Susan (Meryl Streep) is trying to understand John Laroche's (Chris Cooper) life and his envolvement with orchids in the Florida 'gades and transform it into a book. Then, three years later, Susan's book is already written, and Charlie Kauffmann ( Nicholas Cage) is offered the oportunity to adapt the book to a movie script. He wants his script to be as utopic and as pure as can be, without action scenes, love affairs and all the cliches so common in Hollywood. But he suffers from a writer's block and can't get the script written; meanwhile, his twin brother, Donald, decides he also will be a script writer, and his script, full of cliches, is an instant success, driving Charlie mad.This is the plot of ""Adaptation"". All actors display amazing performances: Nicholas Cage is fat, ugly, (more) bald, has a high-pitched annoying voice, and entirely convinces the spectator that THERE REALLY ARE two different Nocholas Cages in the movie. Meryl Streep is a sad character as Susan, and, as always, a good performance (her Nth Oscar nomination). Chris Cooper, an eternal supporting-role actor, is phenomenal, playing an untoothed simpleton with no social skills and plenty of scientific knowledge, and should win his Oscar for the role.About the movie's technics, Spike Jonze is a very good director, and directs his movies in a different way: fast paced scenes that sometimes have no relation with anything else and yet are very meaningful in themselves; he tries to make poetry with some scenes, but it's a playful and loose poetry, and it works very well. There are a couple of car-crash scenes that made me grip harder the arms of the theater's chair, because they seemed so real. And, most impressive of all, at least to me, is a scene where both Nicholas Cage's characters appear together: I've seen plenty of scenes where the same actor appears twice or three times (like Michael Keaton's ""Multiplication""), but never when THE CAMERA IS MOVING! I'm not a specialist in filmmaking, but to me this seems incredible.*SPOILERS*Charlie Kauffmann is at the same time the writer of ""Adaptation"" and a character in his movie. His story is about the struggle he had when trying to write the movie and trying to make it look inovative and new. His touch of genious is the fictional twin brother, Donald, who writes the most obvious cliche-script, and sells it for a fortune. Donald shows Charlie that nor film-producers neither movies audiences are completely ready to watch a movie that can be considered ""pure"" and ""without cliches"", as Charlie would say. When Charlie realizes that, he is finally able to write his script, with lots of car-chasing scenes, an impossible love story, etc. And that's why Donald dies in the end (I warned about spoilers), because he, being a fictional character, and who could be considered Charlie's ""dark side"", has already fulfilled his play in the story, which is showing Charlie that his utopia-script cannot be conceived and will not be accepted in the near future.*END OF SPOILERS*Great movie!Grade 9.3/10",5,One of the best of this year,1046044800,"02 24, 2003",2003,3136,"['Adaptation', 'two', 'plots', 'obviously', 'get', 'together', 'end', 'first', 'New', 'Yorker', 'writer', 'Susan', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'trying', 'understand', 'John', 'Laroche', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'life', 'envolvement', 'orchids', 'Florida', ""'gades"", 'transform', 'book', 'Then', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'Susan', 'book', 'already', 'written', 'Charlie', 'Kauffmann', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'offered', 'oportunity', 'adapt', 'book', 'movie', 'script', 'script', 'be', 'utopic', 'as', 'pure', 'can', 'be', 'action', 'scenes', 'love', 'affairs', 'cliches', 'so', 'common', 'Hollywood', 'writer', 'block', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'script', 'written', 'meanwhile', 'twin', 'brother', 'Donald', 'also', 'will', 'be', 'script', 'writer', 'script', 'full', 'cliches', 'instant', 'success', 'driving', 'Charlie', 'mad.This', 'plot', 'Adaptation', 'actors', 'display', 'amazing', 'performances', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'fat', 'ugly', 'more', 'bald', 'high-pitched', 'annoying', 'voice', 'entirely', 'spectator', 'THERE', 'REALLY', 'ARE', 'two', 'different', 'Nocholas', 'Cages', 'movie', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'sad', 'character', 'Susan', 'always', 'good', 'performance', 'Nth', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'eternal', 'supporting-role', 'actor', 'phenomenal', 'playing', 'untoothed', 'simpleton', 'social', 'skills', 'plenty', 'scientific', 'knowledge', 'should', 'win', 'Oscar', 'role.About', 'movie', 'technics', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'very', 'good', 'director', 'movies', 'different', 'way', 'fast', 'paced', 'scenes', 'sometimes', 'have', 'relation', 'anything', 'else', 'yet', 'are', 'very', 'meaningful', 'make', 'poetry', 'scenes', 'playful', 'loose', 'poetry', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'couple', 'car-crash', 'scenes', 'made', 'grip', 'harder', 'arms', 'theater', 'chair', 'seemed', 'so', 'real', 'most', 'impressive', 'least', 'scene', 'where', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'characters', 'appear', 'together', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plenty', 'scenes', 'where', 'same', 'actor', 'twice', 'three', 'times', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'Multiplication', 'never', 'when', 'THE', 'CAMERA', 'IS', 'MOVING', ""'m"", 'not', 'specialist', 'filmmaking', 'incredible', '*SPOILERS*Charlie', 'Kauffmann', 'same', 'time', 'writer', 'Adaptation', 'character', 'movie', 'story', 'struggle', 'had', 'when', 'trying', 'write', 'movie', 'trying', 'make', 'look', 'inovative', 'new', 'touch', 'genious', 'fictional', 'twin', 'brother', 'Donald', 'who', 'most', 'obvious', 'cliche-script', 'fortune', 'Donald', 'Charlie', 'film-producers', 'movies', 'audiences', 'are', 'completely', 'ready', 'watch', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'pure', 'cliches', 'Charlie', 'would', 'say', 'When', 'Charlie', 'finally', 'able', 'write', 'script', 'lots', 'car-chasing', 'scenes', 'impossible', 'love', 'story', 'etc', 'why', 'Donald', 'end', 'warned', 'spoilers', 'being', 'fictional', 'character', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'Charlie', 'dark', 'side', 'already', 'fulfilled', 'play', 'story', 'showing', 'Charlie', 'utopia-script', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'conceived', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'accepted', 'near', 'future', '*END', 'SPOILERS*Great', 'movie', 'Grade', '9.3/10']",N/A

The screenplay that he is working on is about orchids, but he has difficulty with how the book should be adapted to the screen.  In addition, Charlie's insecurities affect his social life, which snowballs and enhances his negative self-perception.  This in turn reflects on his inept ability to get started with the adaptation of The Orchid Thief.  During Charlie's struggles, he allows his brother Donald (Nicolas Cage) to stay at his place, since Donald is facing difficulties in his life as well in regards to what he wants from life, plus, he is broke.  When Donald recognizes his desire in life, he realizes that he too wants to become a screenwriter and begins taking a screenwriting class, which Charlie mocks.  However, Donald remains positive and seeks Charlie's advice, which Charlie even sees as a waste of his own time.  Adaptation has a superb cast that portrays several characters with thorough character development that is enhanced through the films' brilliant screenplay.  In addition, the direction is remarkable in many aspects and it leaves the audience with a story that causes bewildering enlightening that enhances the true feeling of the characters as well as the story.

Neurotic Charlie's job is to adapt the book ""The Orchid Thief"" by Susan (Meryl Streep) Orlean for the screen.  He apparently has a very loose grasp of reality to start with, and, faced with monumental frustration, begins to put himself into the screenplay, and has the real characters doing fictitious things, including attempted murder (of him!)  Toothless Chris Cooper plays John, the eccentric orchid hunter, who combs Florida's swamps for the elusive ""moth"" orchid and who, in Charlie's mind, falls in love with Susan.It was never clear to me what was real and what was a figment of Charlie's mind.  Even the existence of brother Donald is questionable at times.  The film's story (it couldn't be called a ""plot"") is completely surrealistic.  Add to this the fact that Charlie and Donald Kaufman actually wrote the screenplay for ""Adaptation,"" and that Susan Orlean really wrote a book called ""The Orchid Thief"" about a real man named John, and I was left confused and repelled by the characters and their actions.  It is impossible to know what is real and what is fantasy, and none of the characters (especially the protagonist, Charlie) mattered to me.Nicolas Cage is just okay as the brothers; he was repulsive and unbelievable.  Streep is always flawless, but this script has her playing an unsympathetic, unlikeable woman I didn't care about at all.  Oscar winner Chris Cooper, the reason I watched the film, showed great range as an actor, and certainly deserves points for losing several teeth for this part.  His character was slightly sympathetic but mostly disgusting.I recommend this film to those who like off-beat, avant-guard film-making; there is nothing traditional or familiar here.

Having just penned and had produced your first breakthrough script, you are handed your next assignment; to adapt Susan Orlean's ""The Orchid Theif"", a New York Times bestseller about a hick farmer who has devoted his passions toward the obsessive pursuit of the ghost orchid, as well as raising and illegally smuggling various species of orchids from the state swamps of southern Florida. Add to the picture your ambitious and outgoing twin brother, who also aspires to be a screenwriter. Unlike you, he is compelled to write the ultimate witlessly action-driven screenplay, and he is trumping and triumphing over your already advanced screenwriting skills all because you simply cannot bring yourself to adapt ""The Orchid Theif"". A fierce and antagonizing writer's block has settled over you as you feverishly attempt, in any literary direction you can, to adapt a novel you simply cannot adapt.Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman (who is, for the most part, the individual the movie is based upon) have created a brilliant piece of film that bespeaks of the art of creation and adaptation, both in the written word and in nature. From the frankly bizarre cinematic concoction that was the irreverant and brilliant ""Being John Malkovich"", Jonze and Kaufman, along with bravura performances by Nicolas Cage (as Charlie Kaufman and his twin brother, Donald Kaufman), Chris Cooper, and Meryl Streep are centerstage.As an audience, we are engaged ourselves in a film which questions how far we go to adapt to informalities or structure in art, whilst listening to the off-key tunes of our own desires.

I knew the film would be rather offbeat and experimental because I had seen the trailers.  And it was being directed by Spike Jonze who directed &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;. And Charlie Kaufman, one of the writers, was the creative genius who wrote the John Malkovich film also.  I therefore expected something strange.  Well, I certainly got it.This film is about the screenwriter himself and his struggles with creatively adapting the book.  Nicholas Cage is cast in this role and he sure is a good actor, especially since he is playing two roles - one as the self-effacing screenwriter and one as his twin brother who is also a screenwriter.  The camerawork is clever and Cage does an excellent job of portraying the two personalities.  Meryl Streep is cast as Susan Orlean.  She's good too, but this is neither her best or most challenging performance. Chris Cooper, cast as the Florida orchid hunter manages to seduce the audience as well as Meryl Streep.  But there are plot twists in this film that never occurred in the book.  And much of it was overblown and silly.The film becomes is just too clever for it's own good though.

Alright, I had that much, and nothing else. Well, this didn't gel for me right from the start, let alone the ending.For one thing, it's kind of misleading to say that this is a Nichlas Cage/Meryl Streep movie, because they're barely in it together. It's really a film of two parallel stories, happening out of synch with each other. Cage is a loser screenwriter who's struggling to make an adaptation of Streep's plotless book. He's in real time, while she's two years ago, interviewing the man in the Everglades she winds up writing a book about. A different take on the old flashback routine. Streep's is the more interesting story because of the interviewee, a toothless horticulturalist who smacks of cracker every now and again. We can see her begrudgingly becoming fascinated and infatuated with her subject. Okay!But the Cage storyline is the one getting the most play on-screen, and is it a loser. Stories ABOUT losers are tricky business; ""Rocky"" and ""Marty"" are the exception, not the rule. One bit of movie-making which I found particularly bad was that in Cage's house, he keeps talking to himself, who is lying usually on the floor talking back to him. Only towards the end of the film did I realize that he had a twin brother--I thought this was supposed to be proof of his insanity, or a manifestation of his conflicted inner self. No, it's just his twin brother. Bad, really bad.And the ending? Well, as I didn't like the movie in the first place, I wasn't too broken up by what started happening. I'm not going to spoil anything for anyone, but I will say that it brought to mind ""What Lies Beneath"", a movie that was going along pretty well until it became laughably awful in its denouement. That's the kind of thing that happens here, so preposterous and unmotivated, that it is shameful to Ms. Streep most of all.

There are several stories intertwining that merge together in a strange way, ending with a bang. Adaptation occurs not just in writing a screenplay or in writing a story. Nicolas Cage plays Charlie and his ficticious twin brother, not in the story but in real life. Cage does a superb job with comedy and needs to be in much more. He has a wry witty timing that makes me laugh and smile. Meryl Streep plays the writer of the book, Charlie is adapting into a screenplay, that is all about orchids and a man named John LaRuch, played by Chris Cooper. Cooper is also really funny. I enjoyed his role and his way of adapting to it. The unpredictability is always welcome and many Hollywood films just don't reflect that. You know when you see a Kaufman screenplay it will jerk you out of that mediatative place and make you more alive in the moment. It pulls you to the screen and makes you wonder what's next. I like it because of that and the comedy. Streep was not super funny but it was funny to see her in a role where she isn't so serious or I mean playing someone serious. I hear she is a very happy easy going actor. Well, I would have given it 5, but I usually save 5's for films that really haunt me for days.

604368,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B00005JLRE,Lleu Christopher,"[3, 5]","Adaptation is a film with a gimmick that works. The gimmick is that the movie is about the screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, writing this movie. The movie, in turn, is based on an actual book, The Orchid Thief, by Susan Orlean. This film is easier to watch than to describe; the plot has several layers but is not nearly as confusing as the average spy or action thriller. Nicolas Cage is great as both the neurotic screenwriter and his more confident and superficial twin brother, Donald. Much of the film is about the dynamic between the twins who represent the two extremes of moviemaking; Charlie is the introspective artist while Donald is the easygoing extrovert who can churn out the kind of formula plots that drive Hollywood. Adaptation deeply explores and satirizes both sides of this dialectic between art and commerce without offering any simple answer. Real life screenwriting workshop guru Robert McKee is portrayed as a zealot who compels his pupils to conform to the traditional rules of structure which Charlie so disdains. Yet when Charlie finds himself unable to finish a script based on this book about orchids, he deigns to ask for McKee's help. After showing McKee the script (i.e. the film we've been watching), McKee tells him that all he needs to do is make the end exciting. This is a clue to the unlikely developments that occur in the final half hour. The movie also focuses on Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep), a writer for the New Yorker whose book becomes a desperate quest for direction and fulfillment. She becomes fascinated with the subject of the book, John Laroche (Chris Cooper), a brilliant eccentric who steals a rare species of orchid from protected state land in Florida. The orchids provide the second part of the title's double meaning. In contemplating these flowers, Susan and John confront the Darwinian aspect of adaptation. This movie brilliantly explores on several levels what it means to adapt, both in art and in life and at the same time erases the boundary between the two.",5,A movie about the writing of itself,1042848000,"01 18, 2003",2003,2020,"['Adaptation', 'film', 'gimmick', 'gimmick', 'movie', 'screenwriter', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'writing', 'movie', 'movie', 'turn', 'based', 'actual', 'book', 'Orchid', 'Thief', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'film', 'easier', 'watch', 'describe', 'plot', 'several', 'layers', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'confusing', 'average', 'spy', 'action', 'thriller', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'great', 'neurotic', 'screenwriter', 'more', 'confident', 'superficial', 'twin', 'brother', 'Donald', 'Much', 'film', 'dynamic', 'twins', 'who', 'represent', 'two', 'extremes', 'moviemaking', 'Charlie', 'introspective', 'artist', 'Donald', 'easygoing', 'extrovert', 'who', 'can', 'churn', 'out', 'kind', 'formula', 'plots', 'drive', 'Hollywood', 'Adaptation', 'deeply', 'explores', 'sides', 'dialectic', 'art', 'commerce', 'offering', 'simple', 'answer', 'Real', 'life', 'screenwriting', 'workshop', 'guru', 'Robert', 'McKee', 'portrayed', 'zealot', 'who', 'pupils', 'conform', 'traditional', 'rules', 'structure', 'Charlie', 'so', 'when', 'Charlie', 'unable', 'finish', 'script', 'based', 'book', 'orchids', 'ask', 'McKee', 'help', 'showing', 'McKee', 'script', 'i.e', 'film', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'McKee', 'do', 'make', 'end', 'exciting', 'clue', 'unlikely', 'developments', 'occur', 'final', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'also', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'writer', 'New', 'Yorker', 'book', 'desperate', 'quest', 'direction', 'fulfillment', 'fascinated', 'subject', 'book', 'John', 'Laroche', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'brilliant', 'eccentric', 'who', 'rare', 'species', 'orchid', 'protected', 'state', 'land', 'Florida', 'orchids', 'provide', 'second', 'part', 'title', 'double', 'meaning', 'contemplating', 'flowers', 'Susan', 'John', 'confront', 'Darwinian', 'aspect', 'adaptation', 'movie', 'brilliantly', 'several', 'levels', 'what', 'adapt', 'art', 'life', 'same', 'time', 'boundary', 'two']",N/A

The movie's title is a reference to evolution, to organisms adapting.  The beginning features a montage of life evolving on Earth.  Even Charles Darwin appears in this film.  Only Nicholas Cage's wonderful performance (as two people) saves the movie.  Charlie Kaufman (Nicholas Cage) is one of the most pathetic characters to ever appear on the screen.  Even though he wrote the screenplay for Being John Malkovich, he sweats profusely and his self-depracating thoughts run in constant voiceover.  In need of a good self-help book on self esteem, Charlie is trying to adapt a book called The Orchid Thief to a screenplay.  Charlie is under a lot of pressure as he is way past his deadline.  Distracting him are his annoying twin brother Donald (also Cage), who is a wanna-be screenwriter, and a girl whom Charlie loves, but can't bring himself to tell her.Meryl Streep plays Susan, the book's author, a writer for the New Yorker.  Her plaintive book about tormented orchid hunter John Roche(Chris Cooper) is non-fiction, and Charlie adamantly does not want to add lots of car chases, sex, or even conflict and change.  He just wants to write a story about flowers.The movie progresses, but Charlie doesn't.  He is stagnant, frozen in fear and self-loathing.  The last thirty minutes of the movie explodes in plot twists and action, but by then you are wishing this movie had evolved slightly faster than mankind.This movie piqued my interest in orchids.

I could only imagine the layers of ingenuity that went into the film, and waited breathlessly for the DVD.The 4 star (not 5) rating is because of the DVD, not the film itself.  Yes, it is in Superbit and the picture and sound are superb...but would you watch ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" for the picture and the sound quality??...No, you'd love the movie and want to see all the fascinating special features from the minds of Monty.  Here, you can't wait for director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman to tell the story of how the film came to be, to see the outtakes, to hear what Chris Cooper has to say about bringing one of the most unusual characters in American fiction/nonfiction to the screen.But you don't get any of that.  And that is why you should WAIT to buy the second release of the DVD.  With this version, you will hold one of the most creative films of the last decade in your hands, you'll have subtitles, the trailer...yada yada.  But that is it.On to the film:Susan Orlean's slow paced but entertaining novel probably should have never made it to the big screen.  In fact, you can feel the torture Nic Cage (as Charlie Kaufman on the screen, and his twin brother Donald) goes through as he tries to figure out how to get it there.  The original book ""The Orchid Thief"" is by prize-winning journalist Orlean, who followed alittle known story of orchid thievery in South Florida, to the source.  There she discovered the complex passion for the flower through the eyes of horticulturalist John LaRoche.  Orlean mixes scenes of cracker Florida, orchid obsession (kind of like gold or diamonds), real life tragedy and orchid history in her book.Jones and Kaufman draw the story into a larger story of how Hollywood gets these tomes on the screen, and give a part to author Orleans (played by Meryl Streep) and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Nic Cage) in a story parallel to the flashbacks and current-day Floridian intrigue that Orleans goes through with LaRoche.Cameraplay around Cage's twin roles is masterful and the changeover between Charlie's and Donald's narration is amazing.  Cage is deeply involved in telling of Charlie's torment and his jealousy over Donald -- he's incredibly believable.  Although I feel Daniel Day Lewis and Jack Nicholson surpassed his performance this year, he was far better and more challenged than Adrian Brody, the eventual Oscar winner.  Cage just keeps bouncing back.Streep  captures the over-the-top nature of the Orlean role, (since most of it is fiction, anyway!)and she has good chemistry with Cooper as LaRoche.  And Cooper, a favorite of mine, since ""Lone Star"", is amazing!  He's totally captured the obsessed genius of Orleans book, combined it with an amazing twist of the cracker personality, yet he's winning at the same time as he's wily. He truly deserved the Oscar. There is a scene in the movie, involving LaRoche's family, of a car crash.  It is perhaps the most jolting and terrifying scene I've ever seen on film, and it is not for the faint of heart.  Somehow, that scene roots LaRoche's bizarre personality in what could have caused it.""Adaptation"" is only for serious filmgoers; many will think it a waste of time -- and although the film is an easy 5 star creation, rent the DVD and wait for the next version to own it!",4,"Although I preferred ""Being John Malkovich""...",1053993600,"05 27, 2003",2003,3424,"['director/writer', 'last', 'collaboration', 'film', 'was', 'entranced', 'Adaptation', 'when', 'saw', 'theatrical', 'version', 'could', 'only', 'imagine', 'layers', 'ingenuity', 'went', 'film', 'waited', 'breathlessly', 'DVD.The', '4', 'star', 'not', '5', 'rating', 'DVD', 'not', 'film', 'Yes', 'Superbit', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'superb', 'would', 'watch', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'No', ""'d"", 'love', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 'fascinating', 'special', 'features', 'minds', 'Monty', 'Here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'director', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'writer', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'tell', 'story', 'how', 'film', 'came', 'be', 'see', 'outtakes', 'hear', 'what', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'say', 'bringing', 'one', 'most', 'unusual', 'characters', 'American', 'fiction/nonfiction', 'screen.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'should', 'WAIT', 'buy', 'second', 'release', 'DVD', 'version', 'will', 'hold', 'one', 'most', 'creative', 'films', 'last', 'decade', 'hands', ""'ll"", 'have', 'subtitles', 'trailer', 'yada', 'yada', 'it.On', 'film', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'slow', 'paced', 'entertaining', 'novel', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'made', 'big', 'screen', 'fact', 'can', 'feel', 'torture', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'screen', 'twin', 'brother', 'Donald', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'there', 'original', 'book', 'Orchid', 'Thief', 'prize-winning', 'journalist', 'Orlean', 'who', 'followed', 'alittle', 'known', 'story', 'orchid', 'thievery', 'South', 'Florida', 'source', 'discovered', 'complex', 'passion', 'flower', 'eyes', 'horticulturalist', 'John', 'LaRoche', 'Orlean', 'mixes', 'scenes', 'cracker', 'Florida', 'orchid', 'obsession', 'kind', 'like', 'gold', 'diamonds', 'real', 'life', 'tragedy', 'orchid', 'history', 'book.Jones', 'Kaufman', 'draw', 'story', 'larger', 'story', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'tomes', 'screen', 'give', 'part', 'author', 'Orleans', 'played', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'screenwriter', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'story', 'parallel', 'flashbacks', 'current-day', 'Floridian', 'intrigue', 'Orleans', 'LaRoche.Cameraplay', 'Cage', 'twin', 'roles', 'masterful', 'changeover', 'Charlie', 'Donald', 'narration', 'amazing', 'Cage', 'deeply', 'involved', 'telling', 'Charlie', 'torment', 'jealousy', 'Donald', 'incredibly', 'believable', 'feel', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'surpassed', 'performance', 'year', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'more', 'challenged', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'eventual', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Cage', 'just', 'bouncing', 'back.Streep', 'captures', 'over-the-top', 'nature', 'Orlean', 'role', 'most', 'fiction', 'anyway', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Cooper', 'LaRoche', 'Cooper', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Lone', 'Star', 'amazing', 'totally', 'captured', 'obsessed', 'genius', 'Orleans', 'book', 'combined', 'amazing', 'twist', 'cracker', 'personality', 'winning', 'same', 'time', 'wily', 'truly', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'scene', 'movie', 'involving', 'LaRoche', 'family', 'car', 'crash', 'perhaps', 'most', 'jolting', 'terrifying', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'Somehow', 'scene', 'roots', 'LaRoche', 'bizarre', 'personality', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'caused', 'Adaptation', 'only', 'serious', 'filmgoers', 'many', 'will', 'think', 'waste', 'time', 'film', 'easy', '5', 'star', 'creation', 'rent', 'DVD', 'wait', 'next', 'version', 'own']",N/A

604373,A3E5VKPVU8LAIT,B00005JLRE,Manolis Vozalis,"[2, 5]","Adaptation is a film that describes the creative process of a writer in a very original way. Its basic character is Charlie Kaufman, the true screenwriter of the movie. Nicolas Cage, whose Oscar nomination for the part is certainly justified, depicts him as fat, balding and without any confidence. Everything begins with a hilarious introductory scene, where Charlie accepts to adapt into a motion picture script a book that talks about orchids (the real book by Susan Orlean titled ""Orchid Thief"").Adaptation is a film written by Charlie Kaufman. Those familiar with ""Being John Malkovich"", one of the best movies of year 1999, will probably know what to expect. Still, even they will be pleasantly surprised. Starting with Charlie's attempts to adapt a book that may be wonderful, nonetheless lacks the necessary ingredients (story, action) to be made into a movie, director Spike Jonze introduces us 2 more central figures: Through continuous flashbacks, we meet the writer of ""Orchid Thief"", Susan Orlean, (Meryl Streep flashes in a part which in essence is tragic but has many comic moments) while she collects information for her book. Through extra flashbacks, we get to know Laroche (played by Chris Cooper, a fair Oscar winner), who is the actual inspiration for Orlean. If that was not enough, Donald, the twin brother of Charlie, who may not be as childishly naive as we first think, also appears.Adaptation is a film that combines fiction and fantasy in an almost surreal way. We meet real persons played by themselves, real persons played by actors and persons who are not real!Adaptation is a film that talks about passion in life. Laroche has a passion for orchids. Orlean is still searching to find passion in her life.Adaptation is a film that talks about....adaptation! Not only the adaptation of a book into a film script, but also the adaptation in life, people's necessity for change depending on the circumstances.If things stayed there, Adaptation would have been one of the best films of the year. Unfortunately, and in contrast with the depiction of its screenwriter, the film seems to be too confident in itself, something that at the end turns against it: The last 20 minutes of the movie, based on a smart idea, consist of an indirect and deliberately over the top commentary aimed towards the Hollywood film industry. Still, in my personal opinion, the result was not the desired one. It spoiled the positive impression that Adaptation had created up to that point, leaving me with a bitter taste in the mouth.",4,"A film about orchids, passion, inspiration and...adaptation",1049500800,"04 5, 2003",2003,2540,"['Adaptation', 'film', 'creative', 'process', 'writer', 'very', 'original', 'way', 'basic', 'character', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'true', 'screenwriter', 'movie', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'part', 'certainly', 'justified', 'fat', 'balding', 'confidence', 'Everything', 'hilarious', 'introductory', 'scene', 'where', 'Charlie', 'adapt', 'motion', 'picture', 'book', 'orchids', 'real', 'book', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'titled', 'Orchid', 'Thief', '.Adaptation', 'film', 'written', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'familiar', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'year', '1999', 'will', 'probably', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Still', 'even', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Starting', 'Charlie', 'attempts', 'adapt', 'book', 'may', 'be', 'wonderful', 'nonetheless', 'necessary', 'ingredients', 'story', 'action', 'be', 'made', 'movie', 'director', 'Spike', 'Jonze', '2', 'more', 'central', 'figures', 'continuous', 'flashbacks', 'meet', 'writer', 'Orchid', 'Thief', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'flashes', 'part', 'essence', 'tragic', 'many', 'comic', 'moments', 'information', 'book', 'extra', 'flashbacks', 'get', 'know', 'Laroche', 'played', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'fair', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'who', 'actual', 'inspiration', 'Orlean', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'Donald', 'twin', 'brother', 'Charlie', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'childishly', 'naive', 'first', 'think', 'also', 'appears.Adaptation', 'film', 'fiction', 'fantasy', 'almost', 'surreal', 'way', 'meet', 'real', 'persons', 'played', 'real', 'persons', 'played', 'actors', 'persons', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'real', 'Adaptation', 'film', 'passion', 'life', 'Laroche', 'passion', 'orchids', 'Orlean', 'still', 'searching', 'find', 'passion', 'life.Adaptation', 'film', '.adaptation', 'Not', 'only', 'adaptation', 'book', 'film', 'script', 'also', 'adaptation', 'life', 'people', 'necessity', 'change', 'depending', 'circumstances.If', 'things', 'stayed', 'there', 'Adaptation', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'Unfortunately', 'contrast', 'depiction', 'screenwriter', 'film', 'be', 'too', 'confident', 'something', 'end', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'based', 'smart', 'idea', 'consist', 'indirect', 'deliberately', 'top', 'commentary', 'aimed', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'industry', 'Still', 'personal', 'opinion', 'result', 'was', 'not', 'desired', 'one', 'spoiled', 'positive', 'impression', 'Adaptation', 'had', 'created', 'up', 'point', 'leaving', 'bitter', 'taste', 'mouth']",N/A

This film has two stories going on at the same time which in the end will collide. Charlie Kaufmann is a rare and antithetical guy who cannot express his feelings to a girl that he loves and is furious that his twin brother gets film deals over ridiculous story lines that make no sense, and all at the same time he is trying to write a screenplay about a boring book called Orchids that has no exciting parts to it. The other story handles of Meryl Streeps character when she was writing the book Orchids that Charlie is writing about. She meets this unusual guy that is looking for a particular orchid that is very rare and decides to take Meryl strip on the journey while she writes the book.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[3, 5]","The two most wildly innovative screenplays I have seen filmed are ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation"" - both written by Charlie Kaufman.  Note that I am not saying ""the two most satisfyingly entertaining"" - much of my enjoyment of both of these films are due to the sheer audacity of the labyrinth-on-drugs plotlines.  I won't attempt to give anything away or bother covering what this story *is* as there are hundreds of other reviews you can read for that.  What I DO want to say is that I feel Mr. Kaufman's screenplay is a joke - at his expense - and that he's trying to let us in on it.  When his character (played brilliantly by Nicolas Cage) is finding it difficult to impossible to adapt Susan Orlean's (played by Meryl Streep in yet another incomparable performance) ""The Orchid Thief"" he writes himself into the story, THEN writes in his fictional twin brother (also Cage) who attends a ""screenplay-by-numbers"" class taught by Brian Cox and writes a big bucks by-the-numbers screenplay.An abrupt change occurs in the final act of the movie when (here's my interpretation) Charlie caves in and decides to resolve the movie in a ""hollywood-big-action-suspense-thriller-by-the-numbers"" way.  I won't give away the details, but the real hero of ""The Orchid Thief"" (Chris Cooper in an Academy Award winning performance), the author of that book, the screenwriter and the fictional twin brother all collide in a weird swampy film noire ending that isn't funny ""ha-ha"", but funny in an ""isn't it ridiculous when Hollywood makes films that have to conform to formulas"" kind of way.You're welcome to your own interpretation, but I liked it.

This time, we journey into an even more beautifully disturbed brain: Kaufman's own. In this twisted and brilliant film, the tortured screenwriter not only shares his uneasy attempt at trying to adapt Susan Orlean's book ""The Orchid Thief"" into a movie, but he ultimately (and unintentionlly) writes himself into the screenplay.  Nicolas Cage, in his best role in years, is completely up to the task, playing both the wound-up Charlie and his easy-breezy twin Donald. Meryl Streep goes deliciously (and surprisingly) nuts as Orlean, while Chris Cooper (American Beauty) is magnificant in his portrayal of an obsessed horticulturist (An Oscar nomination is beckoning). During all of its dizzying twists and turns, the movie remains ultimately fascinating not only because of the direction and writing, but because of the lighthearted darkness of the unusually wonderful performances. Weird and engaging in so many ways, Adaptation has all of the right stuff.

604379,A2B6VI9MQI0WKI,B00005JLRE,Matthew Gladney,"[0, 1]","Charlie Kaufman doesn't believe in himself. He is lonely. He isn't good with women. He's even had an original screenplay accepted and turned into a quirky, but acclaimed, feature film (Being John Malkovich). Yet Charlie Kaufman is miserable. His circumstance is one of many similar human conditions which ""Adaptation"" set out to explore. The results, more so than not, are interesting, though the ending robs us of some of the satisfaction which we seek.To understand ""Adaptation"", you must first realize where it is coming from. The director, Spike Jonze, also directed 1999's oddball film ""Being John Malkovich"". As noted earlier, that film was written by Charlie Kaufman. ""Adaptation"" opens on the set of ""Being John Malkovich"", during filming in 1998. We see Nicolas Cage as Charlie. He has just been handed the task of adapting a novel by journalist Susan Orlean, titled ""The Orchid Thief"". The story is based off of an article she'd written about a man named John LaRoche, who filled his time by thieving precious orchids from nature preserves. Orlean has spent a great deal of the book discussing the nature and beauty of the flora which LaRoche seeks. The story focuses so much on just the flowers, and is so un-structured, that Charlie can find no way to adapt it into a workable screenplay.Thus is the story of ""Adaptation"". Charlie Kaufman can't find a way to make The Orchid Thief into a movie, so we have a movie about the trials and tribulations of writers block, of Hollywood back-story, and of people's self-doubt. Charlie has a twin brother living at home (also played by Nicolas Cage), who is everything he is not: confident, successful, good with women, capable of writing with no problem, and happy. For quite a long time, I was convinced that the twin brother did not really exist, that he was just a figment of Charlie's imagination - a projection of his own unrealized ego. As the brother began interacting with other people, however, my assumption proved invalid.The underrated character actor Chris Cooper stars as LaRoche, a man of modest means, with no front teeth. Cooper excels in the role. He owns it. Meryl Streep co-stars as Susan Orlean, and brings a depth and loneliness to the part that is striking. In fact, that is what much of this movie is about. Kaufman, LaRoche, Orlean - they are all lonely. Orlean's life, more than any of the other characters', is a perfect example of feeling alone even when you're with someone. The direction, writing, and acting all come together to work marvelously in this area.The last 1/4 of ""Adaptation"" is a joke (an intentional joke). Things go screwy, and it bears almost no resemblance to the first part of the film, save the inclusion of the characters that we have come to know. This threw me, and left a bad taste in my mouth coming out of the theater. Upon further thought, however, I find that, knowing it's coming, the last act does fit with the rest of the film, in a twisted sort of way. Just be ready for it.""Adaptation"" is an example of creative Hollywood writingat its best. The story is certainly different, and the characters are all drawn with great brushtrokes.

It is so odd and eccentric that many viewers will not like it at all.""Adaptation"" has a plot so intricate that summing it up is no easy task. Also, the line between truth and fiction is intentionally distorted. Nicholas Cage plays dual roles as Charles and Donald Kaufman. Charles really exists and is the movie's screen writer. Donald doesn't exist but is giving a credit on the movie. The movie centers around Charles' attempts to adapt Susan Orleans' book, ""The Orchid Thief"" as a movie. There really is a Susan, who wrote a book by that title, but she is played by Meryl Streep. Some of what we see really happened, but most of it didn't. In essence, this is the best film about writer's block ever written. How does one adapt a book into a movie when the book is basically not adaptable? How can one remain faithful to the book? And what happens when the screen writer becomes obsessed with both the book and the author?Cage is marvelous as the Kaufman brothers. Using no special makeup, he is still able to portray each twin as distinct characters. Meryl Streep has one of her best roles ever as Orleans.

The movie takes so many surprising twists and turns that Kaufman keeps you on your toes.  And then he manages to take the story into territory you never thought it would go (clue: Streep is in her RIVER WILD mode toward the end), and then manages to let his characters change (a screenwriting essential, according to the film!) and &quot;adapt.&quot;The reason ADAPTATION is fascinating is because it is aware of its story and the screenwriting process -- it's about Charlie Kaufman (played by Nicholas Cage).  Immediately, one thinks: &quot;How could a screenwriter put himself in a movie about a screenwriter trying to adapt an unadaptable book?!  Isn't that self-absorbed?&quot;  Then you see Cage, as Kaufman, say the exact same thing in the movie.  Which completely draws you in and makes the film utterly fascinating.Kaufman has made a movie about a book (THE ORCHID THIEF, ISBN: 044900371X)  Then, he fictionalizes the author of that book (Susan Orlean, played by Meryl Streep) as a character in the movie ... get it?  Along the way, Kaufman's story takes over and the book's story fades away.  But Kaufman and Orlean's worlds are intertwined and ADAPTED into a hybrid story about a self-conscious screenwritor and a quirky, undramatic flower story.  Very smart stuff.Director Spike Jonze does an excellent job.  Cage is brilliant as Kaufman and his twin brother Donald, who is the yang to Charlie's yin.  It's so great to see Streep in this type of film.  I liked her better here than in THE HOURS.Even the title of the film has dual meanings:  It's about ADAPTING a book; and it's about how we, as humans, ADAPT and change.  Kaufman's brought it all together beautifully with the orchids as symbols of all this.  Ohhhh, so good!The DVD, by the way, has no extra features beyond a trailer.  The image and sound, however, look and sound great.  I watched it in anamorphic format on my digital widescreen tv, and was completely satisfied with the viewing experience.I'd recommend this film for people who (a) can't stand the major movies out there these days that are aimed at teenagers, (b) like a movie to surprise them and challenge them, (c) like unconventional storytelling (flashbacks, flashforwards, etc.), (d) want to learn about Orchids.

This is not one of those movies where you can just sit down and enjoy, this is one that you really have to focus on and be prepared to be caught off guard.  From the same people who brought you ""Being John Malkovitch"" comes this stunningly amazing and original film that forces you to use your brain.The movie is about Charlie Kaufman, a screenwriter who has agreed to adapt the book ""The Orchid Thief"" by Susan Orlean into a screenplay.  He wants to make a movie that is true to itself and that isn't filled with sex, drugs, car chases, murder, and so on.  However, he is having a lot of trouble trying to make it work for a screenplay and is experiencing some serious writer's block.  It eventually gets to the point where the script he is writing is no longer about the book ""The Orchid Thief,"" but is now about him trying to adapt the book into a movie and what has transpired to get himself there.  That is ONLY a fraction of the movie.  The rest I will not divulge because there are a lot of subtle surprises and twists.I was in absolute awe when the ending credits started to roll.  I wanted to applaud, I wanted to yell, and I wanted to shout.  My mouth was on the floor by the time it was all said and done, and it stayed in my head for the rest of the night.  This is a superb movie that toyed with all of us from start to finish.  And what was great was that half of the audience did not like it because they didn't ""get it.""  For once, I ""got it"" and nobody else in that theatre did.  It's usually the opposite with me, which was why I was so amazed.  The subtleness and the cleverness that prevailed in this film was really a sight to see.Everything was there.  The film was amazingly acted out.  Nicholas Cage is triumphant as he plays both Charles and Donald Kaufman.  He does such a great job that you forget it's the same actor.  Meryl Streep is triumphant as Susan Orlean.  And who can forget the wonderful Chris Cooper who played John Laroche; the orchid collector with no front teeth.  He's a fabulous actor and this, and in my opinion this is one of his best roles ever.  The film was so cleverly written and directed.

The film executive (Tilda Swinton) who has entrusted  him with the job is growing impatient. But Charlie can't figure out how make a story about flowers come alive as a movie. In desperation, he turns to his twin brother Donald (Nicolas Cage) for advice. Donald, who is also a screenwriter, unapologetically writes action-packed recycled screenplays that will sell and doesn't quite understand his brother's fear that he will not be able to do justice to orchids. Charlie spends all of his waking hours pining over ""The Orchid Thief"". He becomes obsessed with its author, Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep). And then it hits him. ""The Orchid Thief"" is about flowers and those who pursue them obsessively. But he must write about what he cares about. He cares about the book's author, Susan Orlean. And he must write about what he knows. He knows about himself and his struggle to write this screenplay. So he will write a screenplay about writing a screenplay, and about Susan Orlean writing the book, and about the obsessive pursuit of orchids. In other words, he will write this movie.No one could ever accuse ""Adaptation"" of lacking creativity. It is a supremely reflexive film that moves back and forth between Charlie Kaufman's efforts to write his screenplay and Susan Orlean's efforts to write her article and book about a toothless scheming orchid thief named John Laroche three years earlier. ""Adaptation"" was directed by Spike Jonze and written by Charlie Kaufman. Name sound familiar? Screenwriter Kaufman has put himself -or part of himself- in the movie, and he has also created a twin brother for himself, who seems to represent a different aspect of his character. He has blended fact and fiction to the point that they are indistinguishable. How much of fictional Charlie's trouble writing the screenplay reflects real Charlie's experience we do not know, but both Charlies seem to have written the same screenplay in the end. Susan Orlean related her experiences in writing ""The Orchid Thief"" in her book, but the movie fictionalizes her character and actions from that point on. There are real people playing themselves in the movie, but those people are all actors. There are actors playing real people -Nicolas Cage as Charlie Kaufman, Meryl Streep as Susan Orlean, Chris Cooper as John Laroche- but those people do fictional things in the film. And there are the usual actors playing fictional characters, although some of the fictional characters seem to be metaphors for real things. And all this is assembled into a reasonably coherent film. There have been films made about film-making before. And films that draw attention to their own artifice. But I think it is safe to say that there has never been a film about writing the screenplay for the very film that you are watching, which is actually an adaptive screenplay of a book on which the movie/screenplay is supposed to be based. It sounds impossible. Apparently it isn't.The problem I had with ""Adaptation"" is that once the novelty wore off, I found very little of interest. I spent the first half of the film marveling at the author's cleverness and pondering who and what was real and what isn't. But by the second half of the film I had that figured out, and I became profoundly bored. I found that the characters aren't really interesting. It's just what's done with them that is interesting. And once you get that, there's nothing else. The story just spins out of control as the film goes on and loses all credibility. I'm sure that`s intended to be funny, but I found it tedious. I think some of the events in ""Adaption""'s final chapter are supposed to be metaphorical. But by then I didn't care. Nicolas Cage, Meryl Streep, and Chris Cooper are all great actors, but I don't think their roles in ""Adaptation "" are especially challenging. I was pleased to see Tilda Swinton in a film, even if it's a small role. She is so luminous and talented, and we see her so seldom. ""Adaptation"" is a very interesting film to think about. But I'm afraid it's more interesting to think about than it is to watch. Students of film will want to see this one because it is one of the most reflexive films in cinematic history and one of the loopiest screenplays. But even though I used to study film, I barely made it through the second half of ""Adaptation"".",3,Clever and Creative...Then Boring and Ridiculous,1054252800,"05 30, 2003",2003,4455,"['Screenwriter', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'adapting', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'novel', 'Orchid', 'Thief', 'screen', 'stumped', 'film', 'executive', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'who', 'entrusted', 'job', 'growing', 'impatient', 'Charlie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'make', 'story', 'flowers', 'come', 'alive', 'movie', 'desperation', 'twin', 'brother', 'Donald', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'advice', 'Donald', 'who', 'also', 'screenwriter', 'unapologetically', 'action-packed', 'recycled', 'screenplays', 'will', 'sell', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'brother', 'fear', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'justice', 'orchids', 'Charlie', 'waking', 'hours', 'pining', 'Orchid', 'Thief', 'obsessed', 'author', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'then', 'Orchid', 'Thief', 'flowers', 'who', 'pursue', 'obsessively', 'must', 'write', 'what', 'about', 'book', 'author', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'must', 'write', 'what', 'struggle', 'write', 'screenplay', 'will', 'write', 'screenplay', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'writing', 'book', 'obsessive', 'pursuit', 'orchids', 'other', 'words', 'will', 'write', 'movie.No', 'one', 'could', 'ever', 'accuse', 'Adaptation', 'lacking', 'creativity', 'supremely', 'reflexive', 'film', 'back', 'forth', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'efforts', 'write', 'screenplay', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'efforts', 'write', 'article', 'book', 'toothless', 'scheming', 'orchid', 'thief', 'named', 'John', 'Laroche', 'three', 'years', 'earlier', 'Adaptation', 'was', 'directed', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'written', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'Name', 'sound', 'familiar', 'Screenwriter', 'Kaufman', 'put', '-or', 'part', 'himself-', 'movie', 'also', 'created', 'twin', 'brother', 'who', 'represent', 'different', 'aspect', 'character', 'blended', 'fact', 'fiction', 'point', 'are', 'indistinguishable', 'How', 'much', 'fictional', 'Charlie', 'trouble', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'real', 'Charlie', 'experience', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Charlies', 'seem', 'have', 'written', 'same', 'screenplay', 'end', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'related', 'experiences', 'writing', 'Orchid', 'Thief', 'book', 'movie', 'character', 'actions', 'point', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'playing', 'movie', 'people', 'are', 'actors', 'are', 'actors', 'playing', 'real', 'people', '-Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'John', 'Laroche-', 'people', 'do', 'fictional', 'things', 'film', 'are', 'usual', 'actors', 'playing', 'fictional', 'characters', 'fictional', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'metaphors', 'real', 'things', 'assembled', 'reasonably', 'coherent', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'films', 'made', 'film-making', 'before', 'films', 'draw', 'attention', 'own', 'artifice', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'there', 'never', 'been', 'film', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'very', 'film', 'are', 'watching', 'actually', 'adaptive', 'screenplay', 'book', 'movie/screenplay', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'impossible', 'Apparently', ""isn't.The"", 'problem', 'had', 'Adaptation', 'once', 'novelty', 'wore', 'found', 'very', 'little', 'interest', 'spent', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'marveling', 'author', 'cleverness', 'pondering', 'who', 'what', 'was', 'real', 'what', ""n't"", 'second', 'half', 'film', 'had', 'figured', 'out', 'became', 'profoundly', 'bored', 'found', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'interesting', 'just', 'what', 'done', 'interesting', 'once', 'get', 'nothing', 'else', 'story', 'just', 'control', 'film', 'credibility', ""'m"", 'sure', 's', 'intended', 'be', 'funny', 'found', 'tedious', 'think', 'events', 'Adaption', 'final', 'chapter', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'metaphorical', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'are', 'great', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'roles', 'Adaptation', 'are', 'especially', 'challenging', 'was', 'pleased', 'see', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'film', 'even', 'small', 'role', 'so', 'luminous', 'talented', 'see', 'so', 'seldom', 'Adaptation', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'think', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'more', 'interesting', 'think', 'watch', 'Students', 'film', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'one', 'one', 'most', 'reflexive', 'films', 'cinematic', 'history', 'one', 'loopiest', 'screenplays', 'even', 'used', 'study', 'film', 'barely', 'made', 'second', 'half', 'Adaptation']",N/A

Chris Cooper is proving to be quite the character actor; his Oscar is well deserved.  It's great to see Meryl Streep in yet another complex role.  And then there's Nicolas Cage.  He has more than demonstrated acting depth and flexibility in everything from romantic comedies to action flicks to tales of despair.  In Adaptation, we get a double treat, as he portrays identical twin screenwriters Charlie and Douglas Kaufman.  As someone who has triplet younger sisters - two identical, the other one may as well be - watching him do this was my favorite part of this movie.  It is amazing to watch 2 (or more) people, virtually indistinguishable, grow up and develop very distinct mannerisms and personality traits along the way, so much so that figuring out who you're dealing with really can hinge on noticing that one little thing they do, or say - or don't do or say.  Cage just nails this.  And he doesn't just focus on making each character a little bit different: underlying the differences is that unspoken bond often observed in twins - or other multiples.

Adaptation is hard to put into words, but it was done by the same director (Spike Jonze) and same screenwriter (Charlie Kaufman).  Kaufman also wrote Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind, which I liked, but did not love, like BJM and Adaptation.  Maybe b/c it had Carrey in a more serious role, which I do not like as much as his comedic roles.  This is the kind of movie that makes you want to find out more, and more and more.  Like how much of the movie is true based on Susan Orlean's book The Orchid Thief?  How much is based on Kaufman's real life?  I now want to read The Orchid Thief and find out more about everyone involved, especially Charlie Kaufman.  Meryl Streep and Nicholas Cage do a superb acting job, as well as, Chris Cooper as John Laroche.  If you liked BJM you will love this movie.  If you didn't like it or didn't get it, don't bother with this one.  Also, if you liked Eternal Sunshine, you will probably also like it, and if you haven't seen any, I would start with BJM, and then either Eternal or Adaptation.  But definately watch BJM before this movie.  This is an excellent movie to watch over and over and get some of the subtle nuances, also I highly recommend watching it with someone so you can discuss afterwards.

At first Streep, who is assigned to follow the thief, played perfectly by Chris Cooper, and write a piece about him for the New Yorker, is sceptical,detached from her subject and even bored.But as she slowly enters a world totally alien to her, it awakens another person inside,one that becomes totally aware of the empitness in her own life, an experience that will forever change her world.Charlie Kaufman in the meantime is trying in vain to get the right approach to his script, in between writer's block, anxiety attacks and self doubts and deprecation. His twin brother Donald on the other hand with his limited intellect but determined and sweet dedication is also writing, a commercial slasher film.The dialogue between the two brothers during the  stages of their writing, and their obvious differences, is a great insight into creativity at work with a lot of added humour.There is too a clever reference from Jonze and the Kaufman brothers about the condition and treatment of writers by Hollywood.The two brothers are played by Nicholas Cage so well!!You will be excused in some scenes for believing even for a second that Charlie and Donald are played by two different actors. This is how great Cage was, moving flawlessly but with substantial emotional and psychological input between the anxiety Charlie and the contentment of Donald.The paths of scriptwriter,his subject and her 'thief' inevitably collide,and there are some twists: The last part of the film although at first glance might seem totally out of place giving the tone of the film, it is really the fantasy again appearing in the mix, and as the credits roll, you will come to appreciate that part very much.The film is very serene, philosophical but never overbearingly so,almost spiritual, about the 'essence' of  creativity,choices,deep changes,realizations,love,support,and basically life itself.Even when the thin line between real life,dreams,fantasy,and fiction is often blurred, it does not matter as much as the genuis performances,direction, the originality, and  subsequently the message of the film.Do not miss Adaptation on all accounts!",5,A Serene Look at  Creativity and Life.,1067558400,"10 31, 2003",2003,3085,"['Adaptation', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'one', 'touched', 'deeply', 'subtle', 'totally', 'original', 'style', 'great', 'achievement', 'talent', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'who', 'amazed', 'audiences', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'brilliantly', 'surreal', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich.In', 'Adaptation', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'dreams', 'fiction', 'collide', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'giving', 'viewer', 'unique', 'experience', 'totally', 'rewarding.Charlie', 'Donald', 'Kaufman', 'real', 'life', 'writers', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'return', 'Adaptation', 'real', 'writers', 'film', ""'supposedly"", 'fictionalized', 'characters.Charlie', 'assigned', 'adapt', 'big', 'screen', 'real', 'life', 'non', 'fiction', 'book', 'Orchid', 'Thief', 'bestselling', 'author', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'played', 'great', 'comeback', 'top', 'form', 'Meryl', 'Streep.The', 'book', 'Orchid', 'thief', 'smart', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'naive', 'redneck', 'who', 'complusive', 'obsessive', 'behavior', 'collect', 'things', 'first', 'Streep', 'who', 'assigned', 'follow', 'thief', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'write', 'piece', 'New', 'Yorker', 'sceptical', 'detached', 'subject', 'even', 'bored.But', 'enters', 'world', 'totally', 'alien', 'person', 'inside', 'one', 'totally', 'aware', 'empitness', 'own', 'life', 'experience', 'will', 'forever', 'change', 'world.Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'meantime', 'trying', 'vain', 'get', 'right', 'approach', 'script', 'writer', 'block', 'anxiety', 'attacks', 'doubts', 'deprecation', 'twin', 'brother', 'Donald', 'other', 'hand', 'limited', 'intellect', 'determined', 'sweet', 'dedication', 'also', 'writing', 'commercial', 'slasher', 'film.The', 'dialogue', 'two', 'brothers', 'stages', 'writing', 'obvious', 'differences', 'great', 'insight', 'creativity', 'work', 'lot', 'added', 'humour.There', 'too', 'clever', 'reference', 'Jonze', 'Kaufman', 'brothers', 'condition', 'treatment', 'writers', 'Hollywood.The', 'two', 'brothers', 'are', 'played', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'so', 'well', 'will', 'be', 'excused', 'scenes', 'believing', 'even', 'second', 'Charlie', 'Donald', 'are', 'played', 'two', 'different', 'actors', 'how', 'great', 'Cage', 'was', 'moving', 'flawlessly', 'substantial', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'input', 'anxiety', 'Charlie', 'contentment', 'Donald.The', 'paths', 'scriptwriter', 'subject', ""'thief"", 'inevitably', 'collide', 'are', 'twists', 'last', 'part', 'film', 'first', 'glance', 'might', 'seem', 'totally', 'place', 'giving', 'tone', 'film', 'really', 'fantasy', 'again', 'appearing', 'mix', 'credits', 'roll', 'will', 'come', 'appreciate', 'part', 'very', 'much.The', 'film', 'very', 'serene', 'philosophical', 'never', 'overbearingly', 'so', 'almost', 'spiritual', ""'essence"", 'creativity', 'choices', 'deep', 'changes', 'realizations', 'love', 'support', 'basically', 'life', 'itself.Even', 'when', 'thin', 'line', 'real', 'life', 'dreams', 'fantasy', 'fiction', 'often', 'blurred', 'not', 'matter', 'as', 'much', 'genuis', 'performances', 'direction', 'originality', 'subsequently', 'message', 'film.Do', 'not', 'miss', 'Adaptation', 'accounts']",N/A

During the movie I did fear that it was going to fail or fall short of my expectations.  Adaptation actually exceeded my expectations.  The entire project could have failed.  A cast of great actors, writers and directors were the driving force.  Yes you have probably heard that before.  But Nicolas Cage gave a performance that drew me in.  His distinction of twin brothers who are direct opposites was amazing.  I can see how it would be difficult for a viewer not to understand the brothers if they didn't have a brother.  I have a younger brother and related to the Kaufman struggle strongly.Beyond great acting is the very strange story line. Kaufman writes him and his brother into the screen play.  In the movie his character also writes himself into his screen play which is part of the film.  It's like looking at a set of mirrors facing one another.  I wonder how much of the brother interaction was real.  All I can say is I like this movie.  Some day I may add it to my DVD collection.  It was entertaining.

Adaptation is wholly original like Frankenstein, a creation of bits and pieces of everything come to life against all probability.  Unlike Frankenstein, Spike Jonze's &quot;Adaptation,&quot; lives in the end and is quite a hoot along the way.I so wanted to only throw four stars at this one, as the film literally adapted from a meandering meaning of life, finding oneself, journey, to guns and swamps and murders and drugs and alligators.  Though it plays along with the conceit true to form, along the way it felt lost.  But happily, screenwriter Donald Kaufman saves the day bringing it back full circle, back to the meaning.Cage seems like an odd choice to play a younger sort of fatter Woody Allen sort of character in Los Angeles, but in the end he too pulls it off.  We realize what a performer Cage is when the audience doesn't blink an eye trying to figure out which twin brother screenwriter is who (both played by Cage).When all is said and done the movie is just so much fun.

Crazy. Zany. Quirky.Any of these words accurately describes Adaptation, so be prepared to pay attention when you're watching this one! Charlie Kaufman is a real-life screenwriter with several television series to his credit, and the also quirky and bizarre film Being John Malkovich. Adaptation picks up with the filming of Being John Malkovich, showing Charlie on the set of that movie. He's a man who loathes himself, who cannot complete a thought, and who is bound by fear.Charlie is hired to adapt the real-life non-fiction book, The Orchid Thief, into a movie. The author, Susan Orleans, is a real person portrayed here by Meryl Streep, and the book is about an ego-centric real-life orchid expert named John Laroche (remarkably played by Chris Cooper). This much is all true. The rest...who can say? Charlie labors over the screenplay, and bits of what he writes are interspersed with sections where he laments his loser status in life. Mixed into the plot is Charlie's twin brother Donald (also played by Cage, but who does not exist in real life, and who, despite the tributes in the end credits of the movie, never did exist) who can't seem to get a job so tries his hand a screenwriting, and, despite his blithe oblivion to the realities of life and Charlie's expert advice, succeeds.At times Adaptation is slow and filled with voice-overs to convey Charlie's thoughts about life, the evolution process, and how, according to Darwin, we've all adapted to various situations to become who we are today. At other times it's shockingly violent, absurdly funny, and down-right sad.Besides the violence, sex, and drug use, Christians may find the message of evolution and adaptation offensive. Yet there is truth that we do adapt to the situations of our lives, and that these changes define us. The movie also encourages viewers to consider the passions of our lives. While the passions of those in the movie may seem bizarre, they demonstrate the meaning people find in life through what they love and pursue--and how futile these passions are outside of knowing God.Nappaland.com Recommends: Adaptation is only for mature viewers who want to think about what they've seen. Even though there are plenty of funny moments, this one could spark serious discussion about pursuing our passions and facing our fears.After the Show...If members of your family choose to view this movie, use these questions to spark discussion about it afterward:---Consider each of the main characters in Adaptation. What is the passion of each one? How does pursuing these passions change the lives of these people? What are you passionate about in your own life? How do you pursue this passion, and what difference do your actions make?---When Donald and Charlie are hiding in the swamp they have a discussion about love. What do you think of Donald's views of loving others? How does what Donald shares change Charlie? How could embracing this view change your relationships?---Charlie is a recognized screenwriter and appears to be successful to those in his business. But in reality he's filled with doubts and fears that keep him from growing and enjoying life. In what ways are you like Charlie?

It's unlike anything I've ever seen which is unsurprising since Kauffman and Jonze's previous film, &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; invoked similar emotions.So it's the story of Charlie Kauffman (real guy) attempting to write an adapted screenplay of a book called &quot;The Orchid Theif&quot; (real book).  Throughout the movie, Kauffman is convinced to instead write the screenplay about himself attempting to write the adaptation rather than writing the adaptation itself.  Which turns out to be the movie that you're watching.  As far as I can tell, the real Charlie Kauffman had actually attempted to write the film adaptation for the Orchid Theif, but after consistant writer's block, he wrote the film Adaptation with him as the lead.  But what about the last third of the movie?  I think the real Kauffman might have heeded the advice given to the fake Kauffman in the movie, &quot;Plot doesn't matter as long as you 'wow' the audience in the end.&quot;  I think this gave the real Kauffman inspiration on how to end his 'true story' with fictional events.

Cage obsesses over writing a screenplay, while his twin brother locks it down in a hilarious short amount of time and suddenly becomes the one trying to save his brother's successful career as a writer.  So they begin stalking this writer,played by Streep who begins having an affair with the man she's written a book about.Writers falling in love with the writer's of their work subject was interesting, where this would resolve was kind of interesting.  Until one brother is taken hostage by Streep when she catches him watching her have an affair, she's married.  Taling both brother's out to the Florida swamp Streep and her lover intend to kill them and this is where the movie lost all credibility with me.  If Streep's marriage had been initially outlined as something she was tremendously involved in then her fearign exposure and loss could've made sense.  However her ego isn't as clearly portrayed as Cage's over his work.  Him snapping and killing and kidnapping is credible but her snapping seems contrived or something to kill off his odd twin brother and show that they really do care for each other.I think the problem with these movies now is that they are strong in casting and in the first two acts but then writers and producers and directors panic and try to pump up the ending.  And messes like Adaptation are made.Good actors, good two thirds of the film but the final third is so out there that it ruins the rest of the film by the time the credits role.

Both his films ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation"" have a lot in common with the Coen Brothers work. No more is this evident than in ""Adaptation"" which has a lot of plot elements very similar to Barton Fink - successful phobic screenwriter can not write his new screenplay, lounges around in his bed most of the time, goes out to find inspiration for his dull storyline, seeks advice from a screenplay expert, ends up entangled in a murder mystery. So ""Adaptation"" is certainly far from original although it may appear that way.Basically the plot is pretty much a simple one and not as convoluted as ""Being John Malkovich"" although it is a story within a story, however it can be appreciated and viewed as just a story about a neurotic screenplay writer Charlie Kaufman and his twin brother Donald Kaufman (Both played really well by Nicolas Cage) who live together. Charlie is trying to write a screenplay about a book called ""The Orchid Thief"" written by Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) about a cultivator of Orchids John Laroche (Chris Cooper). Eventually the four meet up with disastrous consequences.The story is never dull and certainly does move along at a fairly good pace. The interesting part of the characters is Charlie and Donald who are both a little different in their own respects and you can see that Cage is having a lot of fun on the screen. Be warned, the film does turn a little nasty and there are many sad elements to the plot line, but overall it is wickedly funny and the acting is on top form.

It is at once an adaptation of Susan Orlean's bookThe Orchid Thief, a bio pic, a reflection on Kaufman's (played by Cage) many tries at writing said adaptation, and a dissection of film conventions.  The busy narrative, which shifts back and forth in time, calls for the full attention of the audience.  It's an engaging film that will keep the wheels turning in your head long after the final credits roll.Spike Jonze does beautiful work with Kaufman's considerably hard to film script, showing deep understanding of the script.  Nicholas Cage gives a career defining performance as both Charlie and Doug Kaufman (Charlie's fictional brother), evoking more emotions than I thought the man was capable of.  Meryl Streep is great here as well, but my choice for the best supporting actor has to go to Chris Cooper, who gave a strange, sometimes scary, and always heartbreaking performance as John LaRoche, who is as much the tragic hero of this tale as Kaufman.  If you're looking for an intelligent film with an engaging and innovative screenplay, skillful direction, and a talented cast, ""Adaptation"" will easily exceed all your expectations.To put it simply, ""Adaptation"" is a movie about Kaufman trying to write ""Adaptation.""

It was brought to screen by Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, but I will correct that error shortly. Adaptation is a Hollywood insider movie. Like Hollywood Boulevard with Gloria Swanson and William Holden, it takes you behind the scenes. This is a fictionalization of real screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman's bizarre difficulties with adapting a novel, Susan Orlean's real book, The Orchid Thief. A fictional brother was created for Charlie. Donald is the gabby and cheerful alter ego of morose and introspective Charlie, and Cage plays both. This is a nice turn for Cage because he gets to play the twin-opposites with amazing clarity. Charlie is the screenwriter that believes originality and cerebral acrobatics are the stuff of art. His brother, the wifty, Donald is writing a screenplay too. His Hollywood screenwriting guru, Brian Cox plays Robert McKee. The guru preaches formula. But Donald's script is accepted immediately and his success with the ladies is driving his brother crazy. Charlie's writers-block over the Orchid script paralyzes not only his writing but also his ability to love. Meryl Street plays the real life author Susan Orlean. The writer becomes passionately involved with goofball horticulturalist and adventurer, John LaRouche played by Chris Cooper. LaRouche risks his life to find the perfect orchid, a Conradian theme from Heart of Darkness. But if that orchid can be ground up into powder and snorted like cocaine to produce a state of perfect passion, then can we blame the addicted Meryl Street for loving toothless LaRouche? Then there is violence, car chases, and the sex scene. This is the real Kaufman being sarcastic, playful, and err formulistic.

604413,A2TBWLOHTZNK54,B00005JLRE,Reviewer,"[1, 3]","Like the subject of the film I sometimes try my hand at creative writing. The deep anxieties Kaufman has over creativity are something most artists have to put up with. If you want something to just watch and identify with the utterly exhausting, often times neurotic experience of writing, this is a good comedic answer for that.As a film, however, I wasn't all that moved by Adaptation. It's entirely too much of a fluffy, aw shucks, Hollywood clean cut movie, even at it's most brutally cynical. I mean here's a guy dying inside from social anxiety and you tend to notice his incredibly bad hair prosthetic more than genuinely feeling his pain at any point. I think it lacks reality and punch in it's direction, it's almost as gauzy as a romantic comedy at times. Cage turns in a great performance as the oblivious, happy go lucky brother, but as the screenwriter in despair he is just as inappropriate as where the movie ends up. It ends up, by the way, as one huge joke on the viewer, which you'll probably figure out about 1/3 way in anyway. Still, you could argue since that's the case, everything hokey about the movie can be excused... and that is the shaky ground I think people will have to argue the real quality of this as a film over.

604415,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JLRE,RMurray847,"[5, 7]","I just finished watching this terrific movie again.  ADAPTATION is truly one of those movies that actually grows richer upon a second viewing.  The first time I saw it, I was blown away by the fantastic acting and enjoyed trying to follow the dynamics of the movies.  I say ""dynamics"" rather than twists and turns, because on the surface, there are no twists.  The movie just unspools ""realistically"" with a generous dose of carefully labeled flashbacks.  But underneath, what we're really  seeing is a movie that ""twists"" from straightforward storytelling to a movie that may actually be the playing out of the screenplay that is being written (which is what the movie is about).Nicolas Cage plays Charles Kaufman, the screenwriter for BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, who has just been hired to write an adaptation of the bestselling THE ORCHID THIEF by Susan Orlean.  Of course, the fun begins right there, because this movie is written by Charles Kaufman, who actually WAS hired to adapt THE ORCHID THIEF.  Charles is a deeply neurotic and insecure person, prone to flop-sweats and bouts of either shyness or manic babbling.  His internal dialogue, which we share from time to time, is a masterpiece of self-flaggelation.  Charles lives with his twin brother Donald (also Cage), a sweet, simple person who idolizes the work Charles has done and also lives much more in the real world.  Of course, Donald DOESN'T exist in our world.  In the movie, we see how Charles becomes incapable of writing a screen play of Orlean's book, because he admires it so much, because it probably isn't ideal for a movie treatment and because Charles develops a fixation for Orleans (Meryl Streep).From there we are shown glimpses of the story of THE ORCHID THIEF (Chris Cooper, Oscar-winner), how the man was arrested for poaching rare orchids in the swamps of Florida, and how his little story attracted reported Orlean, who went to interview the man and spent enough time with him to develop an entire book.But as the movie progresses, the line between the ""real"" world and how Charles Kaufmann is beginning to reimagine Orlean's relationship with The Orchid Thief (La Rouche is his name).  But there is never a clear demarcation showing when this spin into fantasy land is starting.  But Orlean's adventures become more and more outrageous (an affair with LaRouche, drug use, etc.) that are blatant fictions.And why does Charles fabricate fictional plot twists for his non-fiction screenplay.  First, because his brother Donald has just out of the blue written a non-sensical action movie that has yield him a big contract and because Charles has attended (unwillingly) a screenwriting workshop and has clearly been influenced by all the ""formula"" he's being exhorted to incorporate into his work.  His screenplay starts out as an exploration of the simple joy of loving flowers and becomes a silly action-flick.But what's so fun about ADAPTATION is that we get to experience not only Charles difficulty in imagining a screenplay adaptation of THE ORCHID THIEF, but we get to SEE the story play out alongside it.  It's three movies in one:  the telling of the story of THE ORCHID THIEF, as written by Susan Orlean [by the way, there is one scene, not fiction, where LaRoche and his family are in a car accident that changes his life.  It's undeniably one of the most gut-wrenchingly realistic car crashes ever put on screen.  10 seconds of film seared into your mind forever.], the telling of how a screenwriter named Charles Kaufman couldn't come up with a way to adapt the book and a totally fictional story of THE ORCHID THIEF and the screenwriter's twin brother.  But they are totally intertwined.  It sounds confusing, but the joy of this piece also lies in how clearly we follow it.  At least, a halfway intelligent and attentive viewer will follow.  This is not a wacky, slapstick movie.  It's clever, smart and totally original.  It's also very adult, and is meant for film viewers with some experience with watching and appreciating film.Let me also say that Nicolas Cage gives one of his two or three best performances of all time (Oscar nominated). Meryl Streep (Oscar nominated) is sheer delight, reminding us that she must not be taken for granted...that she is totally able to play a real, flesh and blood American woman with no accent, and make her completely delightful.  Chris Cooper deserved his Oscar win for his daring performance, which mixes lunacy and tragedy into one unique character.  Everyone else gives very able support, especially Brian Cox as the screenwriting workshop leader.  Here's a guy who  simply cannot give less than a commanding performance, however small the role.So, I very much recommend this most unique, funny, moving and well-presented film!",5,"A joyous, unique

Background: Jung would argue that we repress those qualities we don't like in ourself onto our &quot;Shadow&quot; self, and that our conscious is in constant conflict with our shadow in order to preserve the illusion of the &quot;mask&quot; or false self that we believe we are and that we present to the world.  Thus, the qualities that we've repressed onto the Shadow, we associate with the enemy and we project them onto the world.  So those qualities that we loath most in others are precisely those qualities that we secretly loath in ourselves - and in order to attain psychological wholeness we must recognize, embrace, and re-integrate the Shadow (unconscious).The screenwriter here, Charlie, abhors shallowness and superficiality in his craft and strives to write movies of substance without having to resort to formulas &amp; gimmicks.  He resents having to pander to the shallowness of the audience and feels that he has risen above this, but really he has just repressed it onto his shadow (represented by his twin, Donald) who is his exact opposite: shallow and unbothered by artistic considerations.Charlie, is racked by insecurity and self-loathing (the result of his inner battle), while Donald is confident and oblivious to self-judgment.  So, in order to become whole, Charlie first has to realize his state of conflict (represented by his writer's block), recognize the value in his shadow self (he seeks Donald's opinion and help), and work to reintegrate the unconscious (they work together on the screenplay) so that he can achieve psychological wholeness - which is represented in the movie by the brother dying (the unconscious ceases to exist because it has been reintegrated).  At the end of the movie Charlie having become whole is no longer judgmental or insecure but rather is hopeful and healthy.Note: Adaptation as a title is an interesting play on words, also, because the movie deals with the evolutionary process of Adaptation in orchids, the process of writing a screen adaptation of a novel, and most importatly the process of several characters (Charlie especially) negotiating (some successfully, others not) the process of personal adaptation when faced with life's challenges.Another note:  the movie is its own &quot;Shadow&quot;.  It preaches against cheesey literary techniques while employing them liberally at the same time (such as voice overs, the use of twins to display two sides of one's personality, and ultimately resorting to gratuitous sex, violence and action to compensate for lack of substance).

This film didn't get all that much play in the theaters and true, it's not for everyone. But ""Adaptation"" is destined for classic-status. You've probably heard something about it or else you wouldn't be here looking at this page. For a synopsis you can look just about anywhere, so I won't bore you with that. But in the likely chance you are here because you are confused and looking for information, that I can help you with. I won't give any spoilers, I'll just help focus the line between reality and whatever dark corner of Kaufman's mind this came from.True: ""The Orchid Hunter"" is a non-fiction book by author Susan Orlean about an eccentric Floridian named John LaRoche who was convicted of attempting to steal orchids from the Fakahatchee swamp.True: Charlie Kaufman was hired by Colombia to write a film adaptation of the book. ""Adaptation"" is that film.True: Nicholas Cage plays Charlie Kaufman, the real-life screenwriter of this film and the film Being John Malkovich.False: Charlie Kaufman has a twin brother named Donald Kaufman. Kaufman does not have an identical twin brother.False: Donald Kaufman co-write ""Adaptation"" and wrote a script called ""The Three"" that is coming out in 2004. Obviously, if Donald Kaufman doesn't exist he didn't write a screenplay. However, this is still worthy of mentioning just in case you noticed the cast bios on the DVD - it lists Donald Kaufman as a writer with ""Adaptation"" and ""The Three"" as credits.True: Robert McKee is a leading screenwriting teacher with a bestselling book entitled ""Story.""As far as the story itself goes, you'll have to discern fantasy and fiction for yourself. But if you pay careful attention to what McKee says it's fairly obvious at which point in the film fiction enters (""Wow them in the end..."").Lastly, it's been stated that this film has a cop-out in the end. I can't believe someone would actually say that if they remotely paid attention to the film. It's the entire point of the movie! (And Kaufman's philosophy on story-writing.) Kaufman is anti-Hollywood and anti-formula. So clearly there is a great deal of rhetoric and irony involved in his choice of the ending, especially when you consider McKee's words to Kaufmann. It's not a cop-out - it's a brilliant slap in the face to Hollywood.",5,A beautifully blurred line,1068076800,"11 6, 2003",2003,2365,"['brilliantly', 'warped', 'mind', 'screenwriter', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'Adaptation', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'that', 'much', 'play', 'theaters', 'true', 'not', 'everyone', 'Adaptation', 'destined', 'classic-status', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'heard', 'something', 'else', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'here', 'looking', 'page', 'synopsis', 'can', 'look', 'just', 'about', 'anywhere', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', 'likely', 'chance', 'are', 'here', 'are', 'confused', 'looking', 'information', 'can', 'help', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'spoilers', ""'ll"", 'just', 'help', 'focus', 'line', 'reality', 'dark', 'corner', 'Kaufman', 'mind', 'came', 'from.True', 'Orchid', 'Hunter', 'non-fiction', 'book', 'author', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'eccentric', 'Floridian', 'named', 'John', 'LaRoche', 'who', 'was', 'convicted', 'attempting', 'steal', 'orchids', 'Fakahatchee', 'swamp.True', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'was', 'hired', 'Colombia', 'write', 'film', 'adaptation', 'book', 'Adaptation', 'film.True', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'real-life', 'screenwriter', 'film', 'film', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich.False', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'twin', 'brother', 'named', 'Donald', 'Kaufman', 'Kaufman', 'not', 'have', 'identical', 'twin', 'brother.False', 'Donald', 'Kaufman', 'co-write', 'Adaptation', 'wrote', 'script', 'called', 'Three', 'coming', 'out', '2004', 'Obviously', 'Donald', 'Kaufman', ""n't"", 'exist', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'screenplay', 'However', 'still', 'worthy', 'mentioning', 'just', 'case', 'noticed', 'cast', 'bios', 'DVD', 'Donald', 'Kaufman', 'writer', 'Adaptation', 'Three', 'credits.True', 'Robert', 'McKee', 'leading', 'screenwriting', 'teacher', 'bestselling', 'book', 'entitled', 'Story', 'As', 'far', 'story', ""'ll"", 'have', 'discern', 'fantasy', 'fiction', 'pay', 'careful', 'attention', 'what', 'McKee', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'point', 'film', 'fiction', 'enters', 'Wow', 'end', '.Lastly', 'been', 'stated', 'film', 'cop-out', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'someone', 'would', 'actually', 'say', 'remotely', 'paid', 'attention', 'film', 'entire', 'point', 'movie', 'Kaufman', 'philosophy', 'story-writing', 'Kaufman', 'anti-Hollywood', 'anti-formula', 'So', 'clearly', 'great', 'deal', 'rhetoric', 'irony', 'involved', 'choice', 'ending', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'McKee', 'words', 'Kaufmann', 'not', 'cop-out', 'brilliant', 'slap', 'face', 'Hollywood']",N/A

604420,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JLRE,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","***1/2 Spike Jonze' quirky new movie entitled ""Adaptation"" is basically a 21st Century redux of Federico Fellini's 1963 masterpiece, ""8 .""  Out of ideas for a movie?  No problem.  Just make THAT the subject of your next film.  Find the inspiration you need in the fact that you HAVE no inspiration.  Make yourself and the movie you are creating the focus of this new project, thereby turning bitter-tasting lemons into sweet-tasting lemonade.  Who knows?  It worked once for the Italian master, and might very well work for you.Both ""8 "" and ""Adaptation"" deal not only with the creative process, but also with what happens when that process suddenly stops dead in its tracks.  In this case, it is writer Charlie Kaufman who, fresh from the critically acclaimed hit ""Being John Malkovich,"" is confronted with the need to move ahead onto his next project.  Only his creative well has run dry.  Fearful of failure and riddled with self-doubt, the writer, played by a paunchy, balding Nicolas Cage, struggles with adapting a nonfiction magazine article, Susan Orlean's New Yorker piece entitled ""The Orchid Thief"" (about, you guessed it, orchid collecting), into a commercially viable screenplay.  Meanwhile, as deadlines approach and tensions mount, Charlie stares at blank sheets of paper curled up in his typewriter which seem to haunt, taunt and mock him for his inability to bring it all together.  Charlie wants nothing more than to finish his work, yet he refuses to compromise his integrity by going for the obvious in his screenplay.  He wants to distill the essence of Orlean's work and to capture on film the exquisite beauty of the flowers without recourse to phony melodramatics or manufactured conflicts.  The problem is, of course, that film, by its very nature, virtually demands drama and conflict, so Charlie is left with little to work with from the source material.  More galling even than that is the fact that his twin brother (the fictional Donald Kaufman, who earns co-screenwriter credit on the film) is feverishly writing his own screenplay (no writer's block here), a crassly commercial, by-the-numbers, formulaic affair that is the direct antithesis of everything the highly principled Charlie is trying to accomplish.  After all, in the world of commercial moviemaking, ""compromise"" is the great force that ends up moving mountains - and it is the rare artist who can have a successful career without it.The third major character is Susan Orlean herself, a celebrated writer who discovers that, in spite of all her talent and acclaim, she has never found any one thing in her life to be truly passionate about.  In many ways, it is this lack of passion and this tendency to over analyze and over intellectualize every aspect of life that is inhibiting Charlie's creative impulses as well.  When Susan hooks up with this simple orchid collector, John Laroche, she feels that she has finally met a person who, through a profound dedication to a single cause, has unlocked some of the meaning of life.There is certainly much to praise in ""Adaptation.""  The Pirandellian, film-within-a-film narrative structure is clever and challenging, as the moviemakers consistently cross over the line separating fiction from nonfiction. The sly movie industry ""in"" jokes (especially those concerning the ""art"" of screenwriting) are often sharp, witty and incisive.  Kaufman is not afraid to take a few good-natured jabs even at himself, as when Charlie admits that only the most pretentiously self-indulgent and vacuous storyteller would make himself the subject of his own work.  The relationship between the two Kaufmans, both expertly played by the same Nicholas Cage, is fascinating in the way the men can be so alike on the outside and yet so different on the inside.  Charlie is ingenious, introspective and paranoid, always second guessing his every move and evaluating his every action in terms of how they will make others see or judge him, while Donald is the exact opposite, prosaic, happy-go-lucky and openhearted, letting life just happen to him and not giving a damn what anyone else chooses to think of him.  Perhaps, the fictional Donald is really the alter ego Charlie wishes he could be.  How much easier it would be to be comfortable in one's own skin and to be able to conform to Hollywood standards with no nagging conscience to worry about.  The juxtaposition between the two men provides some of the wittiest and, yet, most moving moments in the film.  Meryl Streep does a fine job highlighting the basic emptiness of a searching soul, and Chris Cooper has charm to spare as the toothless orchid collector who serves as the focus of Susan's article and, ultimately, her life.The controversial aspect of ""Adaptation,"" and the one that has proved most troublesome for a large segment of even its most appreciative, receptive audience, is the direction the film takes in its final half hour.  As I see it there are a few possible explanations as to just what Kaufman and Jonze are up to here: a) they simply ran out of inspiration and didn't know how to bring their story to a proper close (unlikely); b) they are doing a parody of the infamous Weak Third Act Syndrome that has haunted writers from the very beginning of recorded history (possibly); or c) they are trying to show  - as the theme of the film implies - that in order to survive and move ahead in this life, we all end up ""adapting"" ourselves to our environment and situations, just as Kaufman himself is doing, finally providing the kind of melodramatic superstructure this essentially nonlinear story about orchid collecting needs to make it saleable.  Yet, regardless of which interpretation is correct, the fact remains that the final act of this film really IS bad and goes a long way towards undercutting the value of so much of the rest of the film.I wish I could say I loved ""Adaptation,"" but the truth is that Kaufman and Jonze seem to have fumbled the ball right as they were crossing over the goal line. ""Adaptation"" is an enjoyable, clever and entertaining work, but that it just might fall short of being the masterpiece so many critics acclaim it to be.",3,the glories and risks of being a

Both are off-beat, quirky films that manage to touch a universal nerve--in other words, they're works of a genuinely imaginative (rather than merely ""quirky"") filmmaker.  ""Eternal Sunshine,"" on the other hand, is a far more commercial species, ear-marked for big returns at the box office and aimed at two large audience bases: the Jim Carey fan club and the marriage-minded spectator who finds him or herself back in the hunt, sustained by a hope, a fantasy, and a prayer.Whereas ""Eternal Sunshine"" is a mildly entertaining, pleasant viewing experience, it's also forgettable to all but the two aforementioned groups.  ""Adaptation,"" on the other hand, speaks to a broader-based audience in age, experience, dreams: the desire to realize personal ambitions, to create, to find one's authentic identity and, in the process, create something of significance or lasting value.  The sad sack, hopeless gamer and eternal ""schmuck"" played by Nicholas Cage has ""J. Alfred Prufrock"" written all over him, even from the film's opening shots with Cage's voice-over commentary on the futility of his life.Although the film eventually takes a few too many wild turns, threatening to run off the rails, it still manages to lodge in the spectator's memory far more securely than the comparatively formulaic ""Eternal Sunshine.""  In the present millennium only one film has thus far emerged as romantic comedy worth of the name: Neil Burger's ""The Illusionist"" (not the more recent animated film of the same title, which I haven't seen).  It's inventive, clever, suspenseful, fully engaged with the ""classic"" romantic themes of life, death, separation, and it ends with a Paul Giamatti epiphany that hits the spectator with the force that James Joyce must have had in mind when he defined literature as a collection of such revelatory moments.",4,"Absorbing, intelligent, useful",1311897600,"07 29, 2011",2011,2048,"['disappointment', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'recently', 'made', 'available', 'Amazon', 'freebie', 'rental', 'led', 'reconsider', 'two', 'previous', 'films', 'same', 'director', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Adaptation', 'are', 'off-beat', 'quirky', 'films', 'manage', 'touch', 'universal', 'nerve', 'other', 'words', ""'re"", 'works', 'genuinely', 'imaginative', 'rather', 'merely', 'quirky', 'filmmaker', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'other', 'hand', 'far', 'more', 'commercial', 'species', 'ear-marked', 'big', 'returns', 'box', 'office', 'aimed', 'two', 'large', 'audience', 'bases', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'fan', 'club', 'marriage-minded', 'spectator', 'who', 'back', 'hunt', 'sustained', 'hope', 'fantasy', 'prayer.Whereas', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'pleasant', 'viewing', 'experience', 'also', 'forgettable', 'two', 'aforementioned', 'groups', 'Adaptation', 'other', 'hand', 'broader-based', 'audience', 'age', 'experience', 'dreams', 'desire', 'realize', 'personal', 'ambitions', 'create', 'find', 'one', 'authentic', 'identity', 'process', 'create', 'something', 'significance', 'lasting', 'value', 'sad', 'sack', 'hopeless', 'gamer', 'eternal', 'schmuck', 'played', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'J.', 'Alfred', 'Prufrock', 'written', 'even', 'film', 'opening', 'shots', 'Cage', 'voice-over', 'commentary', 'futility', 'film', 'eventually', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'wild', 'turns', 'threatening', 'run', 'off', 'rails', 'still', 'lodge', 'spectator', 'memory', 'far', 'more', 'securely', 'comparatively', 'formulaic', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'present', 'millennium', 'only', 'one', 'film', 'thus', 'far', 'emerged', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'worth', 'name', 'Neil', 'Burger', 'Illusionist', 'not', 'more', 'recent', 'animated', 'film', 'same', 'title', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'inventive', 'clever', 'suspenseful', 'fully', 'engaged', 'classic', 'romantic', 'themes', 'life', 'death', 'separation', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'epiphany', 'spectator', 'force', 'James', 'Joyce', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'mind', 'when', 'defined', 'literature', 'collection', 'such', 'revelatory', 'moments']",N/A

My theory is that he didn't know how to end the story, to make it pleasable to an audience since the book didn't have an exciting enough ending, so he went into his strange little brain and came up with this.

Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange""","[1, 3]","Sitting down to write this review I am challenged in the prospect of explaining ADAPTATION to someone who has never seen it. In a nutshell, this film is about a middle-aged very self-consciousness screenwriter named Charlie Kaufman (Nicolas Cage) who is attempting to write a movie adaptation of Susan Orlean's (Meryl Streep) best-selling novel 'The Orchid Thief'. What follows is a tale of Orlean beginning her search for love and passion that she feels her life lacks. She turns her back on her loveless marriage and pursues John Laroche (Chris Cooper), the orchid hunter who was the subject of her book, for personal fulfillment. At the same time, Charlie is struggling to write and feels that he must delve deeper into the relationship between Susan and John in an effort to create inspiration for his writing. All three of their lives become entangled in the swamps of Florida.I applaud Spike Jonze for creating a strange, albeit witty, movie like ADAPTATION. The performances of Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper are admirable. But I couldn't help feeling a tad creepy at the protrayal of the twins of Nicolas Cage. There was a quality about it that bothered me. I am not sure whether Charlie's twin brother really existed or was simply a figment of his imagination. I still am uncertain whether Donald was Charlie's alter-ego.

604432,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B00005JLRE,Shashank Tripathi,"[2, 5]","Easily one of the most audacious, spellbinding films you'll ever see. Trust Kaufman to stretch the boundaries of fiction with a delicious narrative that unfolds into itself, a script that's sporadically humorous but almost always thought-provoking, characters that you end up caring deeply about or even relating to - all of them, and some fabulous acting round the house!Charlie (Cage), our main man, is a writer in a rut stumbling on his way to adapt a screenplay from a book about orchids. The first two-thirds of the movie is an amazing writer's journey through the mutually linked paths of creation and self-doubt.His twin brother Donald (also Cage) however is everything Charlie is not: comfortable among people, facile with women, and, on his first time at the bat, quite capable of dashing off an action script of incomparable goofiness that instantly makes him a screen-writing rage. The moments between the two brothers are filled with comely gaffes but shroud a sinister snub at Hollywood for rewarding the alter-image, Donald.Woven into this narrative is the parallel universe of Susan Orlean (Streep), whose book Charlie is adapting, and her encounters with an interesting bunch of Orchid hunters in Miami, specifically Laroche. As a pent-up New York journalist in a withering marriage, Meryl Streep is as riveting as you've seen her. As the orchid thief Laroche, Chris Cooper turns in his meatiest characterization to date.Following these two skeins, the film engenders a sort of auto-auto-biography with mirror curtains. In addition to Kaufman's voice-over monologues about his inability to render the book onto the screen, it offers ancillary tidbits for contemplation and amusement at every turn. The Charlie in the movie wants to be able to write a movie about flowers, but to do so he must tell the entire history of the universe. Which is troubling. Yet, a montage sequence early in the film actually manages to relate this multimillennial history in an awesome and amusing display of cinematic bravado. This sort of switch and bait happens at several points in the film, and the effect is captivating.There's a finespun undercurrent of the essentially parasitic relationship writers have with their subjects. Orlean's obsession with Laroche is mirrored by Kaufman's obsession with Orlean, and though the overall tone of the film is acerbic, Adaptation is poignant in its portrayal of both writers' struggle to engage with the world and develop passions of their own.Ultimately, Adaptation both succeeds and fails at its own game. By the third act, Kaufman adds in a secret love story, drugs, swamp chases, etc. -- everything that any studio production chief would want to see in a script. My first thought is that Kaufman couldn't find a way to write himself out of his wacky story and therefore opted for the easy way out. Only later did his tactic occur to me, the zany action-packed denouement was perhaps a rebuke of his desire to completely renounce narrative conventions. Not only are conventions handy and reliable, they offer structure to a protagonist (such as our Charlie) who is inert in the extreme.Plebeians may enjoy seeing it at least once for the sheer boggle of it but if like your movies daring/complex/offbeat, then this DVD should be in the front row in your most-precious rack.",5,UTTERLY HYPNOTIZING,1106956800,"01 29, 2005",2005,3319,"['Easily', 'one', 'most', 'audacious', 'spellbinding', 'films', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'Trust', 'Kaufman', 'stretch', 'boundaries', 'fiction', 'delicious', 'narrative', 'script', 'sporadically', 'humorous', 'almost', 'always', 'thought-provoking', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'caring', 'deeply', 'even', 'relating', 'fabulous', 'acting', 'round', 'house', 'Charlie', 'Cage', 'main', 'man', 'writer', 'rut', 'stumbling', 'way', 'adapt', 'screenplay', 'book', 'orchids', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'movie', 'amazing', 'writer', 'journey', 'mutually', 'linked', 'paths', 'creation', 'self-doubt.His', 'twin', 'brother', 'Donald', 'also', 'Cage', 'however', 'everything', 'Charlie', 'not', 'comfortable', 'people', 'facile', 'women', 'first', 'time', 'bat', 'quite', 'capable', 'dashing', 'off', 'action', 'script', 'incomparable', 'goofiness', 'instantly', 'screen-writing', 'rage', 'moments', 'two', 'brothers', 'are', 'filled', 'comely', 'gaffes', 'shroud', 'sinister', 'snub', 'Hollywood', 'rewarding', 'alter-image', 'Donald.Woven', 'narrative', 'parallel', 'universe', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'Streep', 'book', 'Charlie', 'adapting', 'encounters', 'interesting', 'bunch', 'Orchid', 'hunters', 'Miami', 'specifically', 'Laroche', 'pent-up', 'New', 'York', 'journalist', 'withering', 'marriage', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'as', 'riveting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'orchid', 'thief', 'Laroche', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'meatiest', 'characterization', 'date.Following', 'two', 'skeins', 'film', 'sort', 'auto-auto-biography', 'mirror', 'curtains', 'addition', 'Kaufman', 'voice-over', 'monologues', 'inability', 'render', 'book', 'screen', 'ancillary', 'tidbits', 'contemplation', 'amusement', 'turn', 'Charlie', 'movie', 'be', 'able', 'write', 'movie', 'flowers', 'do', 'so', 'must', 'tell', 'entire', 'history', 'universe', 'Which', 'troubling', 'montage', 'sequence', 'early', 'film', 'actually', 'relate', 'multimillennial', 'history', 'awesome', 'amusing', 'display', 'cinematic', 'bravado', 'sort', 'switch', 'bait', 'happens', 'several', 'points', 'film', 'effect', 'finespun', 'undercurrent', 'essentially', 'parasitic', 'relationship', 'writers', 'have', 'subjects', 'Orlean', 'obsession', 'Laroche', 'mirrored', 'Kaufman', 'obsession', 'Orlean', 'overall', 'tone', 'film', 'acerbic', 'Adaptation', 'poignant', 'portrayal', 'writers', 'struggle', 'engage', 'world', 'develop', 'passions', 'own.Ultimately', 'Adaptation', 'own', 'game', 'third', 'act', 'Kaufman', 'secret', 'love', 'story', 'drugs', 'swamp', 'chases', 'etc', 'everything', 'studio', 'production', 'chief', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'script', 'first', 'thought', 'Kaufman', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'way', 'write', 'wacky', 'story', 'therefore', 'opted', 'easy', 'way', 'Only', 'later', 'did', 'tactic', 'occur', 'zany', 'action-packed', 'denouement', 'was', 'perhaps', 'rebuke', 'desire', 'completely', 'renounce', 'narrative', 'conventions', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'conventions', 'handy', 'reliable', 'offer', 'structure', 'protagonist', 'such', 'Charlie', 'who', 'inert', 'extreme.Plebeians', 'may', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'least', 'once', 'sheer', 'boggle', 'movies', 'daring/complex/offbeat', 'then', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'front', 'row', 'most-precious', 'rack']",N/A

This is such a hard film to review without giving away any spoilers, but I'll try to explain the brilliance of this film without giving things away.  It revolves around a screenwriter adapting a book into a film and struggling with the script.  The film is very meta and 'breaks the fourth wall' frequently.  Without mentioning specific plot details, the film is mostly a comedy or 'dramedy', however the last 20 minutes or so turns into a thriller.  The witty, light writing of the film mostly goes away in favor of suspense and unexpected and unnecessary action.  This sounds very stupid, and on the surface it really is, however it's done so intentionally.  I had a very tough time trying to enjoy the end of the film initially (and I still think it's over done), but the majority of the film is so brilliant written and acted, and since the end does make sense in the grand scheme of the film, I give its genre-twisting ending a pass.  Every performance is great in the film, and the chemistry between Nicholas Cage's character Charlie and his brother Donald (also Nic Cage!) is pretty amazing.  It's extremely difficult to have good chemistry with a co-star when he's playing duel roles and acting against no one during principal photography.

604437,A3T8Y73DOFUIR6,B00005JLRE,S. Smith-Peter,"[2, 3]","Charlie Kaufman, a screenwriter, needs to adapt Susan Orlean's book, The Orchard Thief.  He can't do it.  He just can't.  The first part of the movie is about this block, and about Charlie's (fictional) brother Donald, who starts out as a screenwriter and writes something Charlie's agent says is brilliant on his first try.  Meanwhile, Charlie is wracked with anxiety.  The second part of the movie is totally different and involves the working out of all the cliches that Charlie rejected in the first part of the movie.  The best example is of showing someone learning something or realizing something.  Charlie starts off by saying that his script won't do that.  And yet there's a scene at the end where Charlie and Donald are talking as they hide behind a log that is the most powerful such scene I've ever seen.This movie is the verbal equivalent of Fellini's 8 1/2.  In that movie, Fellini plays a director who can't make a movie.  Of course, Fellini also makes a great movie in the process.  But Fellini doesn't believe in words, only in images.  Kaufman believes in words more than in anything else.  I think this makes the scene I mentioned before (the one behind the log) all the more powerful.The movie is a celebration of the power of words to create, even if its just a fictional world.  Words adapt reality. Kaufman adapts his characters, changing the real life Susan Orlean and John Laroche into wildly different characters.  In real life, they never did the things Kaufman has them do at the end of the movie.  With his words, Kaufman has the power to adapt people just like Laroche adapts his orchids.This is a deeply intellectual film.  The last part of the film, which both parodies action films and does them one better, is an application of the ideas floated around in the film's first part.

It's the latter that kept my interest and there are some shiny pearls of wisdom dispensed. Keeping things moving are three excellent performances by Nicolas Cage, Meryl Streep, and Chris Cooper. Streep is no surprise, Cooper is always entertaining, but clearly the biggest eye-opener was Cage's dual performance as twin screenwriters who are as two sides of the same coin. Hard to believe this is the same guy who droned his way through Bruckheimer garbage and those Ghost Rider cheese-a-thons.There's lots of self-referencing, inside jokes, and irony to make me wary, but it's pulled off by the performances and pacing that kept me from falling asleep or losing interest, especially in the drawn out moments that pound to a pulp the psychological breakdown of Cage's Charles Kaufman character.

Kaufman's ingenious screenplay manages both to lampoon and confirm Robert McKee's asinine admonitions on Hollywood screenwriting - it breaks all the rules AND follows them - but it can do this only because it's constantly drawing attention to the process. It establishes its own terms of reference, it tells you how to watch it - and it works brilliantly. Other films do this, too, such as ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Mulholland Drive"". These films don't ignore ""the rules"" of screenwriting so much as invent new ones and take you along for the ride. ""Adaptation"" isn't as hilariously enchanting as ""Being John Malkovich"", but that's because this film is thematically more subtle and has a central character who is somewhat less endearing. Kaufman's crippling insecurity, as performed by Cage, is utterly palpable. The other performances are universally excellent, with Streep and Cooper deserving their Golden Globes. Clearly, Kaufman should win the Oscar for this script. He should have won it three years back for ""Being John Malkovich"".

Or is it the other way around?  Or is it that there's just no way to keep fact and fiction distinct?  Such intriguing questions are at the core of Spike Jonze's hilarious and delightfully clever ""Adaptation.""  Who knew that a combination of orchid thieves, screenwriters, and the maddening creative process could produce such an entertaining viewing experience?Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) writes a book entitled ""The Orchid Thief.""  The book chronicles a Florida orchid hunter named John Laroche (Chris Cooper) who initially appears to be a harmless head case obsessed with finding rare orchids, but soon turns out to be much more.  Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Nicolas Cage) finds out the hidden truths behind Orlean and Laroche after being hired to adapt Orlean's book into screenplay form.  Unable to find the right approach to his task, Kaufman and his twin brother Donald (also played by Cage) delve deeper and deeper into the story behind the story in Orlean's book and what they find is one surprise after another that forces Charlie to change his outlook on life and his own personal perceptions of reality.""Adaptation"" is one of those wonderful mind trip films that functions as a satire on one level and an engaging thesis on the nature of reality on the other.  Its assertion that there are no clear boundaries that separate &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;non-truth&quot; in the post-modern world is an apt statement in an era where reality entertainment has become the newest flavor of the month.  Strong performances are a must to pull off such complicated material and ""Adaptation"" is filled to the brim with them.  Cooper, Tilda Swinton, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Brian Cox are wonderful.

When it was over, I didn't really know what to think because it messed with my head so much.To start, you have this guy (Cage) who is supposed to write the screenplay for &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot;.  His character is developed as your stereotypical creative genius - brilliant, elitist, trying to work out of his depth &amp; intelligence but really suffering as he does so, anti-social, introverted &amp; basically unhappy.  People love his work, but you really feel sorry for the poor guy.It seems simple, but the script keeps adding in such quirky details that your mind is constantly being overstimulated...first off, they have part of the set from &quot;Being John Malcovich&quot; and the actors in their costumes from that set, so your mind wanders to think about that movie for a bit (especially if you've seen it).  Then you have this main screenwriter's identical brother enter the plot - a character who Cage is also playing - and you sit there wondering how Cage did these shots where he talks to &amp; wrestles with himself.And then you start getting drawn into the story of a journalist (Streep) who wrote the book &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot; which the screenwriter is trying to adapt.  You learn that her life is obviously the cliche of the successful &amp; wealthy yet incredibly unhappy &amp; empty American.  She has everything she should want for a happy life, and yet she keeps wanting more...she wants some sort of passion in her life.And then, in yet another layer of the story, you get to learn about the actual orchid thief...a redneck type character down in Florida who has an unexpected passion for orchids.  He is the only one who seems to be an enviable character because he has some sort of deep fulfillment in his life...and yet he has neither money nor culture nor the admiration of many.The set-up might seem clear, but the progress of the plotline certainly isn't.  The storyline starts interweaving these character's lives in such ways that your head starts hurting trying to figure out if it should be able to happen at all.And, all through this, the movie is clearly trying to make a point about passion &amp; fulfillment, but what is it?  Streep chases after it, but does she actually find it?  The main screenwriter is surely the creative genius of the two brothers, but which one would you rather be?As you try to sort such things out, the plot suddenly twists again to become an action movie - complete with guns &amp; a car chase.  This is so unexpected that you leave your questions hanging in mid-air while you try to figure out who you want to &quot;win&quot; seeing that you've become pretty attached to all these characters.The final kicker, really, was that someone told me that one of the characters was supposed to be imaginary....?So, yeah, and when you think about the fact that this movie supposedly came out of the screenwriter's assignment to adapt &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot; (in real life) and that this is what he came up with, you begin to marvel at the depths &amp; intricacies of the human mind...or at least I did.",4,So you want to be a screen writer...,1073952000,"01 13, 2004",2004,3221,"['Well', 'have', ""n't"", 'gone', 'too', 'much', 'way', 'see', 'really', 'twisted', 'movies', 'time', 'one', 'fell', 'lap', 'amp', 'watched', 'When', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'think', 'messed', 'head', 'so', 'much.To', 'start', 'have', 'guy', 'Cage', 'who', 'supposed', 'write', 'screenplay', 'quot', 'Orchid', 'Thief', 'quot', 'character', 'developed', 'stereotypical', 'creative', 'genius', 'brilliant', 'elitist', 'trying', 'work', 'out', 'depth', 'amp', 'intelligence', 'really', 'suffering', 'so', 'anti-social', 'introverted', 'amp', 'basically', 'unhappy', 'People', 'work', 'really', 'feel', 'sorry', 'poor', 'guy.It', 'simple', 'script', 'adding', 'such', 'quirky', 'details', 'mind', 'constantly', 'being', 'overstimulated', 'first', 'have', 'part', 'set', 'quot', 'Being', 'John', 'Malcovich', 'quot', 'actors', 'costumes', 'set', 'mind', 'wanders', 'think', 'movie', 'bit', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Then', 'have', 'main', 'screenwriter', 'identical', 'brother', 'enter', 'plot', 'character', 'who', 'Cage', 'also', 'playing', 'sit', 'there', 'wondering', 'how', 'Cage', 'did', 'shots', 'where', 'amp', 'wrestles', 'himself.And', 'then', 'start', 'getting', 'drawn', 'story', 'journalist', 'Streep', 'who', 'wrote', 'book', 'quot', 'Orchid', 'Thief', 'quot', 'screenwriter', 'trying', 'adapt', 'learn', 'life', 'obviously', 'cliche', 'successful', 'amp', 'wealthy', 'yet', 'incredibly', 'unhappy', 'amp', 'empty', 'American', 'everything', 'should', 'want', 'happy', 'life', 'yet', 'wanting', 'more', 'sort', 'passion', 'life.And', 'then', 'yet', 'layer', 'story', 'get', 'learn', 'actual', 'orchid', 'thief', 'redneck', 'type', 'character', 'down', 'Florida', 'who', 'unexpected', 'passion', 'orchids', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'be', 'enviable', 'character', 'sort', 'deep', 'fulfillment', 'life', 'yet', 'money', 'culture', 'admiration', 'many.The', 'set-up', 'might', 'seem', 'clear', 'progress', 'plotline', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'storyline', 'interweaving', 'character', 'lives', 'such', 'ways', 'head', 'hurting', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'happen', 'all.And', 'movie', 'clearly', 'trying', 'make', 'point', 'passion', 'amp', 'fulfillment', 'what', 'Streep', 'actually', 'find', 'main', 'screenwriter', 'surely', 'creative', 'genius', 'two', 'brothers', 'one', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'try', 'sort', 'such', 'things', 'out', 'plot', 'suddenly', 'again', 'become', 'action', 'movie', 'complete', 'guns', 'amp', 'car', 'chase', 'so', 'unexpected', 'leave', 'questions', 'hanging', 'mid-air', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'want', 'quot', 'quot', 'seeing', ""'ve"", 'become', 'pretty', 'attached', 'characters.The', 'final', 'kicker', 'really', 'was', 'someone', 'told', 'one', 'characters', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'imaginary', 'So', 'yeah', 'when', 'think', 'fact', 'movie', 'supposedly', 'came', 'screenwriter', 'assignment', 'adapt', 'quot', 'Orchid', 'Thief', 'quot', 'real', 'life', 'what', 'came', 'up', 'begin', 'marvel', 'depths', 'amp', 'intricacies', 'human', 'mind', 'least', 'did']",N/A

Director Spike Jonze tells the story of Charlie Kaufman (Nicolas Cage), a chubby, poor self-esteem stricken screenplay writer assigned to adapt the Susan Orlean novel about flowers into a film.  As Charlie learns more about Orlean (Streep) and her obsession with the quirky Orchid lover John Larouche (played by Oscar-winning Chris Cooper, who was long overdue for the recognition, for he should have won for ""American Beauty), he realizes even further that he does not possess the qualities to write a formidable script based on the book.While he is attempting to write a script and loosing his mind in the process, Charlie is encouraged by his upbeat, yet overly annoying screen-writing brother Donald (also played by Cage; they are twin brothers) to write the story in a more traditional, Hollywood style.  Charlie refuses this notion and flies to New York to meet Orlean in search of the perfect idea for his script.  Through this journey, Charlie learns about what it means to love, what his purpose in life should be, and how a simple thing such as an orchid can change lives.What makes ""Adaptation"" so intriguing is that it is a film about a screen-writer who is writing a script about the actual events that are transpiring on film.  Jonze takes us on a crazy ride of emotions, through the troubled mind of Charlie, the desiring soul of Susan Orlean, and the zany antics of the grisly-toothed Larouche that envelopes around a theme that will touch all those who grasp it.  Cage is wonderful as the joint brothers and Streep is stellar as usual in her supporting role.

Then it hit me. Everything in the movie was symbolic for something else. I just wasn't getting it.  What this movie does is work on two scales: 1)What you see is what you get (the no brainer) and 2)The intellectual story where you schizophrenically get so into everything about this movie until it twists your brain.If you choose to look at the second way to view this, which I recommend you need to remember that nothing in this movie is real. Well Charlie Kaufman the screenwriter (Being John Malkovic) is real.  His job is to write the screenplay for the book, The Orchid Thief by Susan Orlean.  It is something that he can't seem to get a finger on, and he attempts many different approaches.  He battles to keep the screenplay true to the book but instead he can't succeed, without the help of his evil twin brother (also played by Cage).  The counter twin also shows lots of symbolism.  As a last resort, he sticks himself in the middle of the screenplay which still doesn't solve the problem until his daffy brother writes his own screenplay after attending a screenwriting workshop run by Robert McKee.  McKee actually runs this in real life and Kaufman has stated a very negative view of it.  It isn't until the movie Kaufman attends a McKee workshop that he uses all the recommended wrap up endings (car chase, shootings etc.)  The movie sums up kind humorously, probabally to the chagrin of Orlean herself (notably quoted as displeased with the project) as she is portrayed in a way which helps Kaufman end his project---fast, easy, sex, drugs, car chases, violence. Somehow it works. Now if you think this is confusing, go see the movie, if you want to think. If you don't want to think, see the movie and view it on the surface only, which is still entertaining.Additional Warning-If you've been involved in a traffic accident there are two depicted in this film in a very realistic way.",4,"Fact, Fiction, Imagination",1041206400,"12 30, 2002",2002,2061,"['Fact', 'Fiction', 'Imagination-3/4', 'starsAbout', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'film', 'was', 'wondering', 'was', 'seeing', 'biggest', 'bomb', 'writer', 'block', 'Barton', 'Fink', 'Then', 'hit', 'Everything', 'movie', 'was', 'symbolic', 'something', 'else', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'getting', 'What', 'movie', 'work', 'two', 'scales', '1', 'What', 'see', 'what', 'get', 'brainer', '2', 'intellectual', 'story', 'where', 'schizophrenically', 'get', 'so', 'everything', 'movie', 'brain.If', 'choose', 'look', 'second', 'way', 'view', 'recommend', 'need', 'remember', 'nothing', 'movie', 'real', 'Well', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'screenwriter', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovic', 'real', 'job', 'write', 'screenplay', 'book', 'Orchid', 'Thief', 'Susan', 'Orlean', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'finger', 'many', 'different', 'approaches', 'keep', 'screenplay', 'true', 'book', 'instead', 'ca', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'help', 'evil', 'twin', 'brother', 'also', 'played', 'Cage', 'counter', 'twin', 'also', 'lots', 'symbolism', 'last', 'resort', 'middle', 'screenplay', 'still', ""n't"", 'solve', 'problem', 'daffy', 'brother', 'own', 'screenplay', 'attending', 'screenwriting', 'workshop', 'run', 'Robert', 'McKee', 'McKee', 'actually', 'real', 'life', 'Kaufman', 'stated', 'very', 'negative', 'view', ""n't"", 'movie', 'Kaufman', 'McKee', 'workshop', 'recommended', 'wrap', 'up', 'endings', 'car', 'chase', 'shootings', 'etc', 'movie', 'up', 'kind', 'humorously', 'probabally', 'chagrin', 'Orlean', 'notably', 'quoted', 'displeased', 'project', 'portrayed', 'way', 'Kaufman', 'end', 'project', '-fast', 'easy', 'sex', 'drugs', 'car', 'chases', 'violence', 'Somehow', 'Now', 'think', 'confusing', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'want', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'think', 'see', 'movie', 'view', 'surface', 'only', 'still', 'entertaining.Additional', 'Warning-If', ""'ve"", 'been', 'involved', 'traffic', 'accident', 'are', 'two', 'depicted', 'film', 'very', 'realistic', 'way']",N/A

First and foremost is the film's originality.  This has to be one of the most refreshingly original screenplays I have come across in my years of avid film watching.  Ironically enough, originality is one of the film's main themes, one that the main character struggles with, and ultimately it is originality that places this film at the top of the heap.Equally impressive is the superb acting.  My respect and admiration go to Nicholas Cage, whom I have never been a fan of until this film.  His performance in dual roles in Adaptation is nothing short of flawless.  As for Meryl Streep, we have come to expect the sort of performance she turns in.  Finally, Chris Cooper, completely deserving of his Best Supporting Actor Oscar, makes it impossible for us to imagine anyone else playing his character, he becomes John Laroche.I will not get into details or a summary of the plot, as this is one film that you just need to see for yourself.  It seamlessly integrates aspects of comedy, introspection, drama, parody and satire.  Just when the inundation of recycled ideas and countless sequels to movies that should never have been made in the first place had me losing faith in originality in film, Adaptation comes along to save the day.My only warning comes from what I have percieved to be a love/hate reaction to this film.

604455,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B00005JLRE,Tucker Andersen,"[17, 25]","In ADAPTATION, the director Spike Jonze and screnwriter Charlie Kaufman have collaborated again (think BEING JOHN MALKOVICH) on another clever, brilliant, and totally weird artistic endeavor. Charlie Kaufman (who writes himself into the film as a screenwriter) is played by Nicholas Cage, as is his twin brother Donald. Charlie is hired to adapt the book THE ORCHID THIEF by Susan Orlean into a screenplay. However, the assignment stymies Charlie since the book has little plot or action and is mostly about flowers and the character development of John Laroche, an orchid poacher and character who serves as Orlean's introduction to the illicit orchid trade and is constantly in pursuit of his passion/scheme of the moment. Concomitantly, Donald is attempting to write a commercially successful screenplay of the action/adventure/mystery genre with a really strange twist.The movie shifts between the frustration of Charlie over his writer's block and inability to produce a workable story line for his script (while Donald is proceeding apace with his project based partially on Charlie's suggestions) and the relationship of the writer Orlean (Meryl Streep) and Laroche three years earlier while he was a resource for her research as an author. All the character development is amazing well done; if not for the excellent job done by Streep and the fact that Cage manages to succesfully play both his characters in a totally believable and complementary way, Chris Cooper would [use] the movie as Laroche. Even in minor roles Tilda Swinton as Charlie's producer and Brian Cox as a screenwriting teacher excel in their performances and add depth to the movie.Nevertheless, while I admired the concept, was intrigued by it's execution, and laughed out loud at some of the humor, overall I did not greatly enjoy the story and definitely have no desire to see it again. So, if you like really great performances and unique films, this will undoubtedly qualify as five star. Otherwise, despite the surprise twists which the film at times takes, you may conclude as I did that it is perhaps slightly long (due to the complicated nature of the filmplay) and perhaps increasingly depressing in its latter stages (where it departs from the book as it attempts to develop the plot which the book lacks). It definitely does not have the broadbased appeal to be a major box office success although it will undoubtedly develop a loyal cult following of admirers.

604458,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JLRE,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[6, 10]","Adaptation is an odd hybrid; it's a combination of elements from the nonfiction book The Orchid Thief: Charlie Kaufman's difficult time writing an adaptation of that book and a fictional plot integrated into all those elements involving Charlie's nonexistant twin brother; a strange character study and murder thriller. It's rolled into a messy package which makes it all the more essential viewing.Although I would hesitate to call this a classic film, it's an unusual one and highly imaginative. Like Kaufman's script for Being John Malkovich, Adaptation takes all the rules of script writing and genre definitions and subverts them. Jonz' direction only enhances the odd, quirky qualities of Kaufman's original script.Nicolas Cage gives a strong performance as both Donald and Charlie Kaufman. I've had my doubts about him as an actor in the past; he started off with a lot of potential which Cage seemed to throw away in meaningless poorly written action flicks. Here Cage (who was becoming a self-parody as an actor) both redeems and reinvents himself. We'll see where he goes from here. Chris Cooper and Meryl Streep are both outstanding in their roles as well. Streep has the same name as the author of The Orchid Thief although her character is completely fictionalized and the events come completely from Kaufman's mind. It's ironic that Kaufman should share the same last name as Andy Kaufman. Andy Kaufman played with the conventions of comedy stretching (and some would say damaging) the boundaries of stand up and performance comedy. In many respects, Charlie Kaufman does much the same for screenwriting.Adaptation is odd film that may take a bit of time to grow on you. For all of its weaknesses, it's an astonishingly original script from a very unconventional mind. Jonz' direction works wonders with Kaufman's words; he seems the perfect director to interpret Kaufman's bizarro world view.The picture quality is outstanding on this superbit DVD. There are few if any analog artifacts and I didn't detect any compression problems. The 5.1 sound is state of the art although I did notice it was a bit flat and compressed for many of the quieter dialog dominated scenes. There are few extras as all the extra disc space is primarily devoted to the higher picture and sound quality found on Superbit DVDs.I'd recommend renting before buying to see if Kaufman's off kilter world view is your cup of tea. If you find it is, you won't mind buying the DVD after viewing it.

604459,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,B00005JLRE,wellwellwell,"[0, 2]","In a film about a man writing a screenplay about life without sex, drugs, drama, action, comedy, and all that Hollywood jazz, 'Adaptation' becomes a movie composed of sex, drugs, drama, action, comedy, and all that Hollywood jazz. Didn't like the way that sentence made you think? Then don't watch this movie. This is one of the craziest, most atypically typical movies to come out of recent years. And what should we expect from a guy (Spike Jonze) who brought us a movie about a porthole to John Malkovich's brain? 'Adaptation' stars Nicolas Cage, Chris Cooper, Meryl Streep, and... well, Nicolas Cage. It will go without saying 15 minutes into the film that it is not your average piece of work. Even if at the end it appears its as average as anything you've ever seen. I was a bit worried about all the praise set over the head of this film, but was more than impressed with almost all of its aspects. Alas, there were a few climactic points I found to be a bit disappointing. But then again, that's life.In this motion picture, Cage stars as Charlie Kaufman, who is presently struggling over a script for ""The Orchid Thief"" (a book about flowers) he's to adapt into a movie. The reason Kaufman struggles is not because he's unintelligent or a bad writer, but because he wants [his] film to be real. ""Real"" in the sense that it's only about flowers. Nothing more, nothing less. Genuinely precise; as he might envision. Saying that Charlie experiences an exceptional case of writer's block would be understating the situation rather nonchalantly. Along with his endless writing problems, he has a twin brother, Donald (Cage again), also a writer, who is frequently at his heels begging for helpful tips on his own screenplay; which is a thriller/horror film about split personalities and cops, entitled 'The 3' (go figure). What makes Don so amiable is that he does everything by the book. Or at least derived from whatever writing guru McKee (played brilliantly by Brian Cox) tells him. Fittingly enough, that's exactly how Charlie would never do it. Or so he thinks. There is great contrast betwixt Charlie and Don; allowing for some great comical passages. Those fruitful, but important scenes (along with the appearance by Ron Livingston), are the lone laughable ingredients in 'Adaptation'. And they're just enough. On top of it all, Charlie has troubles with his ""sex"" life. We won't even go there. When we are not seeing Charlie write and bicker with his identical twin, we see past assembly with John Laroche (Cooper) and Susan Orlean (Streep). Laroche is a scruffy but loveable orchid pilferer who becomes infamous when he's caught stealing a rare, endangered flower. He is then pursued by THE NEW YORKER journalist Susan Orlean, who consequently writes the book ""The Orchid Thief"" based on her experiences with Laroche and his flower-filled expeditions and stories. That somewhat brings you up to speed. The plot for 'Adaptation' is very long and (probably) too in-depth for me to review justly. And to be honest, if I kept going on and on it would spoil the film's originality and it's prominence as a ""great"" movie. Here, the hype is certainly not over-hyped.The few weak points I found within the movie are only weak points because I didn't like the way they flowed with the movie. The movie goes in a kind of slow, laid back manner that allows you to think while still being, to a large extent, entertained. During the climaxes--which are the only time you'll be expected to tolerate action sequences--the effects and affects were minimal compared to the dramatic and melodramatic parts. Some of them were very, very good (specifically the car crashes); but one in particular was upsetting. I won't spoil it for you. Still, as I said before, that's life. The acting by everyone is more than superb. It's obvious why they and the movie got so many Academy Award nominations (four, to be exact). Because this film is so incredibly different from 'Being John Malkovich', I can't say if you liked that one you'll like this one.

604463,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B00005JLRE,Wheelchair Assassin,"[5, 7]","Alright, let's just get the honorifics out of the way right now: Adaptation is as smart as Election, as endearing as Rushmore, and as original as, well, anything I've ever seen all at the same time.  It's a testament to how much a clever idea can make a movie, but it has a lot more going for it that that.  Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has written himself into a movie about writing himself into a movie, and if that sounds like a pretentious idea it's because it is.  But at the same time, Adaptation more than holds its own in the areas of wit, characterization, and plot development.  Its concept is decidedly highbrow and unquestionably outlandish, but at the same time Adaptation is a boldly unconventional, relentlessly unpredictable, and unapologetically quirky movie.So, what exactly is Adaptation about?  Well, here's a partial list: creativity, self-loathing, emotional attachment, forbidden love, fraternal relations, the movie industry drug use, and last but not least, flowers.  Of course, that's not all it's about, either, as there is a plot holding everything together.  Adaptation mainly centers around Charlie Kaufman's attempts to adapt Susan Orleans's book The Orchid Thief into a movie while simultaneously trying to tune out his twin brother Donald as Donald attempts to write a screenplay of his own.  After some, er, questionable decisions in recent years (Gone In 60 Seconds, anyone?), Nicolas Cage apparently once again finds his niche here, pulling off the difficult task of portaying the polar opposites of the tormented artiste Charlie and the charming hack Donald in a dual role that has an awful lot to say about the nature of creative genius.  The rest of the movie notwithstanding, Charlie's frenetic inner monologue alone is practically worth the price of admission.That said, there's plenty more going on in this movie, well more than can be easily encapsulated in a simple review.  Constantly leaping back and forth in time and blurring the line between fiction and reality until it's difficult to tell which is which, Adaptation is considerably more challenging than even Kaufman's latest effort, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which wasn't exactly an easy watch itself.  Various plots are juggled in a seemingly haphazard manner, but seeing them all come together in the end makes for much of the fun of watching.  More to the point, the movie never sacrificies emotional depth or humor for the sake of cleverness, largely avoiding the self-congratulatory air that has doomed so many lesser movies of its ilk (this means you, Lost in Translation).  It certainly doesn't hurt that there are startingly authentic performances from skilled actors like Merryl Streep, Chris Cooper, and Bryan Cox on display, or that the insanely adorable Maggie Gyllenhaal is around in a minor role.Now, before I take my leave I should stress that Adaptation is most certainly not a movie for everyone.  If you favor movies with conventional storylines, fast-paced plots, or lots of action, you probably will not like this one.  But, if you're in the mood for something different, Adaptation should not be missed.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is worth checking out as well.",5,Even better than advertised,1107561600,"02 5, 2005",2005,3209,"['Alright', 'let', 'just', 'get', 'honorifics', 'way', 'right', 'now', 'Adaptation', 'as', 'smart', 'Election', 'as', 'endearing', 'Rushmore', 'as', 'original', 'well', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'same', 'time', 'testament', 'how', 'much', 'clever', 'idea', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'going', 'Screenwriter', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'written', 'movie', 'writing', 'movie', 'pretentious', 'idea', 'same', 'time', 'Adaptation', 'more', 'own', 'areas', 'wit', 'characterization', 'plot', 'development', 'concept', 'decidedly', 'highbrow', 'unquestionably', 'outlandish', 'same', 'time', 'Adaptation', 'boldly', 'unconventional', 'relentlessly', 'unpredictable', 'unapologetically', 'quirky', 'movie.So', 'what', 'exactly', 'Adaptation', 'Well', 'here', 'partial', 'list', 'creativity', 'self-loathing', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'forbidden', 'love', 'fraternal', 'relations', 'movie', 'industry', 'drug', 'use', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'flowers', 'course', 'not', 'either', 'plot', 'holding', 'everything', 'together', 'Adaptation', 'mainly', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'attempts', 'adapt', 'Susan', 'Orleans', 'book', 'Orchid', 'Thief', 'movie', 'simultaneously', 'trying', 'tune', 'out', 'twin', 'brother', 'Donald', 'Donald', 'write', 'screenplay', 'own', 'er', 'questionable', 'decisions', 'recent', 'years', 'Gone', '60', 'Seconds', 'anyone', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'apparently', 'once', 'again', 'niche', 'here', 'pulling', 'off', 'difficult', 'task', 'portaying', 'polar', 'opposites', 'tormented', 'artiste', 'Charlie', 'charming', 'hack', 'Donald', 'dual', 'role', 'awful', 'lot', 'say', 'nature', 'creative', 'genius', 'rest', 'movie', 'notwithstanding', 'Charlie', 'frenetic', 'inner', 'monologue', 'alone', 'practically', 'worth', 'price', 'admission.That', 'said', 'plenty', 'more', 'going', 'movie', 'well', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'encapsulated', 'simple', 'review', 'Constantly', 'leaping', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'blurring', 'line', 'fiction', 'reality', 'difficult', 'tell', 'Adaptation', 'considerably', 'more', 'challenging', 'even', 'Kaufman', 'latest', 'effort', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'easy', 'watch', 'Various', 'plots', 'are', 'juggled', 'seemingly', 'haphazard', 'manner', 'seeing', 'come', 'together', 'end', 'much', 'fun', 'watching', 'More', 'point', 'movie', 'never', 'emotional', 'depth', 'humor', 'sake', 'cleverness', 'largely', 'avoiding', 'self-congratulatory', 'air', 'doomed', 'so', 'many', 'lesser', 'movies', 'ilk', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'are', 'startingly', 'authentic', 'performances', 'skilled', 'actors', 'Merryl', 'Streep', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Bryan', 'Cox', 'display', 'insanely', 'adorable', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'around', 'minor', 'role.Now', 'take', 'leave', 'should', 'stress', 'Adaptation', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'movie', 'everyone', 'favor', 'movies', 'conventional', 'storylines', 'fast-paced', 'plots', 'lots', 'action', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'one', ""'re"", 'mood', 'something', 'different', 'Adaptation', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'as', 'well']",N/A

(In a similarly veined Coen brothers flick, the writer blocked screen scriber has a run in with who we can only say is the devil personified)...'the brothers' take a trip or two trying to cull any morsel of interesting item from Streep's novel and her personality. Sooner or later they run smack into the misanthropic toothless orchid hunter who's been turning her onto the mysterious orchids extracts. Chris Cooper gets a role he can sink his teeth into and Streep sends more postcards from the edge. Easily this is a show that requires more than one viewing to capture it's shadings and subtleties. When you do watch it, have some wine along wit'cha.",5,No one plays 'the blonde with a dark side' better...,1111363200,"03 21, 2005",2005,1037,"['Streep', 'Witness', 'role', 'Sophie', 'Choice', 'Klute', 'oh', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'monumental', 'case', 'writer', 'block', 'need', 'make', 'snorefest', 'novel', 'orchids', 'things', 'screenplay', 'do', 'novel', 'justice', 'dark', 'side', 'duo', 'role', 'played', 'Cage', 'brother', 'just', 'oughtta', 'go', 'Die', 'Hard', 'audience', 'similarly', 'veined', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'flick', 'writer', 'blocked', 'screen', 'scriber', 'run', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'devil', 'personified', 'brothers', 'take', 'trip', 'two', 'trying', 'cull', 'morsel', 'interesting', 'item', 'Streep', 'novel', 'personality', 'Sooner', 'later', 'run', 'smack', 'misanthropic', 'toothless', 'orchid', 'hunter', 'who', 'been', 'turning', 'mysterious', 'orchids', 'extracts', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'role', 'can', 'sink', 'teeth', 'Streep', 'more', 'postcards', 'edge', 'Easily', 'show', 'more', 'one', 'viewing', 'capture', 'shadings', 'subtleties', 'When', 'do', 'watch', 'have', 'wine', ""wit'cha""]",N/A

You never have to wonder which twin is which because Nicolas did such a masterful job of portraying both brothers. As the plot unfolds, there are many turns in the road and it keeps you guessing all the way to the end.
