1001001,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000GB5MH4,A Customer,"[11, 20]","If viewers rent this movie to see the cute, adorable burrowing owls, they are in for a real disappointment, as the owls only appear briefly in two scenes. The rest of the film is a bland mish-mash of environmental consciousness and silly plot points. And there's not much that rings true, especially when the central conceit of the movie is the implausible idea of building a pancake house in the middle of a tropical forest.Pretending to skewer the greed of land developers and big corporations, Hoot centers in Roy Eberhardt (Logan Lerman) who is wrenched from Montana ranch country when his dad is transferred once again, this time to small-town Florida. Roy has a bit of a hard time fitting in to the local scene; relentlessly bullied by the class idiot he's rescued by the tough Beatrice (Brie Larsen), star of the girl's soccer team.Roy soon discovers that Beatrice has a connection to a mysterious sprinting nature-boy known as Mullet Fingers (Cody Linley), whose mission, should Roy choose to accept his part in it, is to sabotage the pancake house construction site, the future home of Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House, which is actually the refuge of a collection of burrowing owls.The dopey contractor Curly (Tim Blake Nelson) can't get ahead on construction because vandals keep pulling up his surveying stakes and the even stupider Officer Dan Delinko (Luke Wilson) is assigned to catch the vandal or vandals who step up their opposition to Mother Paula's by putting alligators in the site's portable toilets.It doesn't take much imagination to figure out that the kids are going to triumph over the nasty pancake developer (Clark Gregg) and what looked good on paper - the movie is based on Carl Hiaasen's book - doesn't necessarily transfer well to the screen. Wilson's character is the funniest and most interesting and the only scene of real interest is when he falls asleep in his squad car only waking to find all the windows spray-painted black and has to get around in a vehicle that looks like a golf cart.The film as a whole is insipid and sloppily directed, the actors - particularly the teenagers are unmemorable and the action is just too precious for words. We never really find out why characters do what they do and their dialogue is dreadfully artificial, and their back-stories are absurd. The errant subplots go nowhere and the movie has an episodic TV quality that is so pronounced, it's almost embarrassing to watch.Admittedly the owls are cute, but if you blink you'll miss them. I really had to struggle to get through this film and if the burrowing owls and other susceptible species in southern Florida have to depend on movies like this to raise public compassion and understanding, they really are in trouble. Give this one a big miss.

Lappen,"[3, 3]","Roy Eberhardt (Logan Lerman) has moved eight times over about as many years, and is loving life in Montana when his father (Neil Flynn) announces that his Justice Department job will now bring the family to South Florida.His first day at school begins inauspiciously. Roy is watching a local barefooted boy sprint along beside the bus at an amazing pace when the local bully, Dana Matherson (Eric Phillips) presses his face up against the window, just to show who's ""boss."" In return, Roy decks Dana, accidentally breaking his nose. Next, he clashes with the school's female bully, soccer star, Beatrice Leep (Brie Larson). He's quickly nicknamed ""cowgirl.""Roy's only friend seems to be Garrett (Dean Collins), a good guy, but a scaredy cat, when it comes to the local menaces--Dana and Beatrice. Garrett's only good for warning Roy to watch his step, not moral (or any other) support.As the story evolves, Roy soon discovers that the swift-running barefoot guy is actually Mullet Fingers (Cody Linley), so nicknamed by his sister Beatrice, for his amazing ability to catch Florida's swift-swimming baby mullet with his hands--on a single try. Mullet has gone AWOL from a boot camp ""reform school"" in order to save Coconut Cove's endangered ground-nesting burrowing owls.Unfortunately, the fictional Mother Paula's Pancake House plans on building its 100th store on a large lot that's home to the owls. Developer Chuck Muckle (Clark Gregg) and his on-site construction director Curly Branitt (Tim Blake Nelson) very well realize the owls are there, that building would destroy their nests, and doom them to death--and that these actions counter Florida and U.S. national laws. But they could care less. They've actually destroyed pages from their environmental impact statements concerning the owls.Meanwhile, Coconut Cove Mayor Grandy (Robert Wagner) supports the construction, gung ho, since it will create a handful of jobs.Based on Carl Hiaasen's Newbery-award-winning novel of the same name, Hoot is a neat little confection of a film, appropriate for little kids, teens and grown-ups alike. There is enough rebellion to suit your rebellious teen, fun enough for the little ones, and education and love enough to suit parents and grandparents.The Florida wildlife scenes were shot on location, and are both realistic, and true. So are the overall themes of over development and destruction of natural habitat, and the general disregard of developers for these concerns. As an added plus, viewers are treated to a lovely score by Florida country star, Jimmy Buffet.My biggest disappointments with this film were its delayed box office release, and its unbelievably short theatrical run. We blinked, and it was gone. Both were hard to understand, since this film is a definite treat. Try it. It beats pancakes--even for this particular pancake lover.--Alyssa A.

Soon, though, he becomes aware of a bigger problem: a franchise restaurant chain is trying to build a site in the town, right where a number of burrowing owls live. This movie has the look of a family film, but it is pretty more radical than it seems, as it shows sympathetically how Roy and a couple of friends do not shy away from lawbreaking (including vandalism of private property and briefly kidnapping the manager of the chain of restaurants) in the name of environmentalism (to save owls, no less). Now, one might agree or not with those actions, but at least the movie has the courage from not shying away from its convictions.

1001005,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000GB5MH4,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I'm all for a good family film, but this one just drove me nuts.  The performances are weak throughout (seriously, UNREALISTIC) and the plot has so many holes in it, it just falls to pieces.  The basic premise is that of three teens who work together to foil the plans of a popular pancake franchise from opening a restaurant in their town.  The area they want to build in is populated by tiny owls that live in holes in the ground.  One of the kids is the new kid (who is having trouble with bullies at school), another is a runaway and then you have his sister (who was, at one time, a bully).  The film is entertaining to a certain degree, but overall this movie can't really deliver much of anything.  The scenery is beautiful, but that is a given; this is Florida we are talking about.  With Luke Wilson dumbing it up again (where has his career gone?) and a slew of untalented young actors fumbling their way through rocky dialog (these kids suffer at the hands of a ridiculous script), `Hoot' becomes one of those films you really want to forget.  It is lathered with stereotypes unworthy of entertainment and it is built upon plot holes big enough to fit a tractor through (the entire character of `Mullet Fingers' is just, well, wrong), all of which culminating together to create a movie that is far from worth your time.",2,I didn't really give a hoot...,1281916800,"08 16, 2010",2010,1331,"[""'m"", 'good', 'family', 'film', 'one', 'just', 'drove', 'nuts', 'performances', 'are', 'weak', 'seriously', 'UNREALISTIC', 'plot', 'so', 'many', 'holes', 'just', 'pieces', 'basic', 'premise', 'three', 'teens', 'who', 'work', 'together', 'foil', 'plans', 'popular', 'pancake', 'franchise', 'opening', 'restaurant', 'town', 'area', 'want', 'build', 'populated', 'tiny', 'owls', 'live', 'holes', 'ground', 'One', 'kids', 'new', 'kid', 'who', 'having', 'trouble', 'bullies', 'school', 'runaway', 'then', 'have', 'sister', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'bully', 'film', 'entertaining', 'certain', 'degree', 'overall', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'deliver', 'much', 'anything', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'given', 'Florida', 'are', 'talking', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'dumbing', 'up', 'again', 'where', 'career', 'gone', 'slew', 'untalented', 'young', 'actors', 'fumbling', 'way', 'rocky', 'dialog', 'kids', 'suffer', 'hands', 'ridiculous', 'script', 'Hoot', 'one', 'films', 'really', 'want', 'forget', 'lathered', 'stereotypes', 'unworthy', 'entertainment', 'built', 'plot', 'holes', 'big', 'enough', 'fit', 'tractor', 'entire', 'character', 'Mullet', 'Fingers', 'just', 'well', 'wrong', 'culminating', 'together', 'create', 'movie', 'far', 'time']",N/A

I got it yesterday as a fluke, just to check out, with no expectations and it's wonderful.My son is 8 and now enjoys movies about kids who are a little older than him.  In this movie they're in jr. high and have the usual issues with bullies, being the new kid in town, etc., but it's delivered in a refreshing way.  The young actors are good, the scenery is gorgeous and the music is pleasant (Jimmy Buffet provides original songs).I was impressed with the directing and storytelling of the movie and the cinematography.  Luke Wilson plays a cop who is comic relief, but he never mugs or goes slapstick.  The comedy is more subtle and sophisticated.  Very impressive.The plot is interesting and has some fun twists as well as a moral about saving nature without hitting you over the head with it.  Overall, adorable and engaging.

Of course the bully wasn't going to accept an apology and just threatened the poor kid some more.The best part was trying to figure out why this one kid was hiding in the woods.

This particular Hoot involves endangered burrowing owls in Florida. The center of attraction is three teens trying to stop a pancake house from destroying a nesting site to build their 100th pancake place. The small town including the mayor is looking forward to the new buisness, but then they don't know all the facts. Throughout we have some comedy with the deputy sheriff being the butt some of the time.Overall this is pretty good family entertainment and I especially recommend to people that enjoyed ""Fly Away Home"" and ""Alaska"". With the great acting from all the teens, gorgeous Florida scenery, mellow Jimmy Buffet music, good dramatic writing with a little comedy thrown in, and talented directing, this movie is a winner. I recommend it to families. Especially if you are a fan of Disney animal movies or teen movies. Granted there is some questionable behavior, but anyone that has a teen knows that is common occurrence and just requires some adult input.One other thing I want to mention because of a review that felt this movie condones teens destroying property. Although I don't condone destruction of property by those protecting endangered species, I certainly don't condone any business covering up known protected animals being on the land they want to develop. Don't call the tree hugger a terrorist when the business man is hiding the truth and trying to destroy the evidence.

1001019,AIO247KHD2O40,B000GB5MH4,James N Simpson,"[0, 0]","Hootthe novel was a sensational read which has gone on to win many an award and even entered as study material, into the curriculum of many a school.  The basic plot for those who don't know is a boy who has been moved around the country by his father's (whose played by Neil Flynn, the janitor in Scrubs) changing career locations is about to start his first day in a Florida school.  Being new he of course attracts the attention of the school bully and while pressed up against the glass notices a weird barefoot boy running alongside the bus.  Intrigued he decides to follow the boy the next day and not only in the process further makes the bully his arch nemesis, but also seems to anger the hottest most popular girl in school.  As the film goes on he learns of the plans of a pancake house to build on top of the habitat of endangered ground dwelling owls and that the mysterious barefoot boy is currently the only thing standing between them and certain death.When there's a successful book out there it's easy for film studios to simply buy the rights and turn the book into some other project they had waiting in the wings (ie I am Legend) that only really angers fans of the original book who have eagerly been waiting to see what they saw in their minds as they turned the pages appear on the big screen.  Hoot however sticks fairly closely to the novel's plot (there are granted a few places it didn't which would have made more sense if it did such as the cottonmouths and dogs scene where in the movie if you hadn't read the book and were unaware that Mulletfingers had secured the mouths of the snakes together you'd be left thinking well dinner time snakes, by by owls).  As a whole though the movie does make sense and the changes for film do as well such as Beatrice in the film being an attractive blond girl, whereas her character in the book more resembled the actor who played Dana Matherson, the male bully in the film.Hoot is a great film that teaches both kids and adults the value of conservation through the main character's determination to save some rare endangered ground dwelling owls.  The bonus features on the DVD also expand this message with features such as teaching kids to make animal sanctuaries in their own backyards and meeting the actual real life owl stars of the film and learning how they came to be in captivity in the first place from the actions of humans.  The awareness that Mullets ecoterrorism actions are not what will stop developers who are doing the wrong thing by all the characters by the end of the film is also a great message and one overlooked by those who criticise this film and novel (and probably who haven't seen or read Hoot).I thought the kids playing the main characters did a good job bringing them to the big screen. They probably could have cast Dana the bully a bit better as he more resembled an obese kid who would have got picked on in school himself than someone you'd fear, but then again being a kids film they maybe needed to lessen the realism and scariness of the bully.  The soundtrack also enhanced the film including songs by Jimmy Buffet (who bought the rights to the film - find out more in the special features) who also played the marine biology teacher (changed from history teacher in the book to suit his personality).  Brie Larson (who plays Beatrice) also has a song in the film.  Scenic footage of Florida landscapes and various wildlife is almost worth watching the film for alone, but of course we're glad they added the Hoot storyline.Read the book by Carl Hiaasen then watch the DVD as you'll get a lot more out of it.  The DVD also includes full length commentary by Carl Hiaasen as well as an interview with him and his thoughts on the film version of his highly successful book.A great movie and DVD package!",5,It's Rare to See a Movie Stay So Close to the Storyline of a Successful Novel,1208736000,"04 21, 2008",2008,3815,"['Hootthe', 'novel', 'was', 'sensational', 'read', 'gone', 'win', 'many', 'award', 'even', 'entered', 'study', 'material', 'curriculum', 'many', 'school', 'basic', 'plot', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'boy', 'who', 'been', 'moved', 'country', 'father', 'played', 'Neil', 'Flynn', 'janitor', 'Scrubs', 'changing', 'career', 'locations', 'start', 'first', 'day', 'Florida', 'school', 'Being', 'new', 'course', 'attention', 'school', 'bully', 'pressed', 'up', 'glass', 'weird', 'barefoot', 'boy', 'running', 'alongside', 'bus', 'follow', 'boy', 'next', 'day', 'not', 'only', 'process', 'further', 'bully', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'also', 'anger', 'hottest', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'film', 'plans', 'pancake', 'house', 'build', 'top', 'habitat', 'endangered', 'ground', 'dwelling', 'owls', 'mysterious', 'barefoot', 'boy', 'currently', 'only', 'thing', 'standing', 'certain', 'death.When', 'successful', 'book', 'easy', 'film', 'studios', 'simply', 'buy', 'rights', 'turn', 'book', 'other', 'project', 'had', 'waiting', 'wings', 'ie', 'am', 'Legend', 'only', 'really', 'angers', 'fans', 'original', 'book', 'who', 'have', 'eagerly', 'been', 'waiting', 'see', 'what', 'saw', 'minds', 'turned', 'pages', 'appear', 'big', 'screen', 'Hoot', 'however', 'fairly', 'closely', 'novel', 'plot', 'are', 'granted', 'few', 'places', 'did', ""n't"", 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'did', 'such', 'cottonmouths', 'dogs', 'scene', 'where', 'movie', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'were', 'unaware', 'Mulletfingers', 'had', 'secured', 'mouths', 'snakes', 'together', ""'d"", 'be', 'left', 'thinking', 'well', 'dinner', 'time', 'snakes', 'owls', 'whole', 'movie', 'make', 'sense', 'changes', 'film', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'Beatrice', 'film', 'being', 'attractive', 'blond', 'girl', 'character', 'book', 'more', 'resembled', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Dana', 'Matherson', 'male', 'bully', 'film.Hoot', 'great', 'film', 'kids', 'adults', 'value', 'conservation', 'main', 'character', 'determination', 'save', 'rare', 'endangered', 'ground', 'dwelling', 'owls', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'also', 'expand', 'message', 'features', 'such', 'teaching', 'kids', 'make', 'animal', 'sanctuaries', 'own', 'backyards', 'meeting', 'actual', 'real', 'life', 'owl', 'stars', 'film', 'learning', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'captivity', 'first', 'place', 'actions', 'humans', 'awareness', 'ecoterrorism', 'actions', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'will', 'stop', 'developers', 'who', 'are', 'doing', 'wrong', 'thing', 'characters', 'end', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'message', 'one', 'overlooked', 'who', 'criticise', 'film', 'novel', 'probably', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'read', 'Hoot', 'thought', 'kids', 'playing', 'main', 'characters', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'big', 'screen', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'cast', 'Dana', 'bully', 'bit', 'better', 'more', 'resembled', 'obese', 'kid', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'got', 'picked', 'school', 'someone', ""'d"", 'fear', 'then', 'again', 'being', 'kids', 'film', 'maybe', 'needed', 'lessen', 'realism', 'scariness', 'bully', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'enhanced', 'film', 'including', 'songs', 'Jimmy', 'Buffet', 'who', 'bought', 'rights', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'special', 'features', 'who', 'also', 'played', 'marine', 'biology', 'teacher', 'changed', 'history', 'teacher', 'book', 'suit', 'personality', 'Brie', 'Larson', 'who', 'Beatrice', 'also', 'song', 'film', 'Scenic', 'footage', 'Florida', 'landscapes', 'various', 'wildlife', 'almost', 'worth', 'watching', 'film', 'alone', 'course', ""'re"", 'glad', 'added', 'Hoot', 'storyline.Read', 'book', 'Carl', 'Hiaasen', 'then', 'watch', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'get', 'lot', 'more', 'DVD', 'also', 'full', 'length', 'commentary', 'Carl', 'Hiaasen', 'as', 'well', 'interview', 'thoughts', 'film', 'version', 'highly', 'successful', 'book.A', 'great', 'movie', 'DVD', 'package']",N/A

They touch you like fairy-dust, even while you don't know that you've been touched.They are also difficult to make into movies.For example, one wrong step, one (or two) miscasts, and Harry Potter would have been dead on the theater floor. Sadly, Hoot was more than one misstep or miscast away from the floor. Mostly missteps. I think they cast the film quite well.Without question it's a marvelous and touching story, and I'm puzzled and frustrated with the director and producers for turning it into a cotton-candy-movie (known in the 70s as the Disney movie of the week). There are strong characters here, powerful characterizations, but none of them are realized, and the connections between the characters are obviously truncated.Roy-Mullet Fingers-Beatrice: there was some work that needed to be done there, and it could have been done more masterfully within the confines they set for themselves. Or perhaps the studio didn't want to release anything more than a 90 minute film and this is what was left.The relationships between those three characters were essential to this story, and there simply wasn't a relationship there - *in this movie*. The book is an entirely different subject, but *in this movie* the three main characters had no *real* motivation to be concerned with each other. It was all rather flimsy.It's interesting to note that ""Jack and Bobby"" stars Logan Lerman (the main character, Roy), and Dean Collins (Garret) are reunited here (although one wonders if twelve months qualifies as ""reunited"") as best friends. Very interesting casting choice, especially since Garret's role was - in the film - entirely unessential, and in ""Jack and Bobby"", Logan's and Dean's characters were thick as thieves.Like I said, there's the essential necessity of ""fairy-dust"". There may have been a big can of it somewhere, but the people in charge of this were dipping their fingers into the donut box instead and extracting powdered sugar. Or having their hands forced into the powdered sugar bowl instead.More ridiculous decisions have certainly been made.",3,"Five star book, three star movie",1161302400,"10 20, 2006",2006,2099,"['Books', 'Hoot', 'are', 'magical', 'touch', 'fairy-dust', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'been', 'touched.They', 'are', 'also', 'difficult', 'make', 'movies.For', 'example', 'one', 'wrong', 'step', 'one', 'two', 'miscasts', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'dead', 'theater', 'floor', 'Sadly', 'Hoot', 'was', 'more', 'one', 'misstep', 'miscast', 'away', 'floor', 'Mostly', 'think', 'cast', 'film', 'quite', 'question', 'marvelous', 'touching', 'story', ""'m"", 'puzzled', 'frustrated', 'director', 'producers', 'turning', 'cotton-candy-movie', 'known', '70s', 'Disney', 'movie', 'week', 'are', 'strong', 'characters', 'here', 'powerful', 'characterizations', 'none', 'are', 'realized', 'connections', 'characters', 'are', 'obviously', 'truncated.Roy-Mullet', 'Fingers-Beatrice', 'was', 'work', 'needed', 'be', 'done', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'more', 'masterfully', 'confines', 'set', 'perhaps', 'studio', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'release', 'anything', 'more', '90', 'minute', 'film', 'was', 'left.The', 'relationships', 'three', 'characters', 'were', 'essential', 'story', 'there', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'relationship', '*in', 'movie*', 'book', 'entirely', 'different', 'subject', 'movie*', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'had', '*real*', 'motivation', 'be', 'concerned', 'other', 'was', 'rather', 'flimsy.It', 'interesting', 'note', 'Jack', 'Bobby', 'Logan', 'Lerman', 'main', 'character', 'Roy', 'Dean', 'Collins', 'Garret', 'are', 'reunited', 'here', 'one', 'wonders', 'twelve', 'months', 'qualifies', 'reunited', 'best', 'friends', 'Very', 'interesting', 'casting', 'choice', 'especially', 'Garret', 'role', 'was', 'film', 'entirely', 'unessential', 'Jack', 'Bobby', 'Logan', 'Dean', 'characters', 'were', 'thick', 'thieves.Like', 'said', 'essential', 'necessity', 'fairy-dust', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'can', 'somewhere', 'people', 'charge', 'were', 'dipping', 'fingers', 'donut', 'box', 'instead', 'extracting', 'powdered', 'sugar', 'having', 'hands', 'forced', 'powdered', 'sugar', 'bowl', 'instead.More', 'ridiculous', 'decisions', 'have', 'certainly', 'been', 'made']",N/A

The steady drumbeat of authority=bad, children=good scares and saddens me. OK, let's accept that business wants to build in conflict with nature. But movies like this set the philosophical tone we see all too much today -- the ends justify the means. Our teen heroes are of course in the right since they are fighting for cute animals and the corporation is bad because they want to make money (er.., and provide valuable products and provide employment... but never mind about that). So because they are in the ""right"" means, according to this, and other movies, that assault, abduction, vandalism, theft, and destruction of property is just fine and dandy. At one point, Hero #1, ""Mullet Fingers"" suggests driving the CEO's Hummer into the swamp. When Hero #2 says, ""No, you can't do that!,"" I think, ""Well, finally some sense of right and wrong around here."" My mistake. He then goes on to say that Mullet Fingers would get arrested and then it'd be harder to convince everyone... How about because it is morally WRONG to destroy another person's automobile!?

Hoot, like these films, is very true to the spirit of the Carl Hiaasen text and like those films is an excellent movie to see even without having read the books (if you choose THAT strange path.)""EVERYBODY in AMERICA WANTS TO LIVE IN FLORIDA...EVERYBODY BUT ME,"" says Roy Eberhard, a 14 year-old who's moved around too much, this time leaving Montana thanks to his dad's job transfer. Roy (played well by Logan Lerman) is the new kid-- in humid fictitious Coconut Grove, Florida. But it's still the same routine: by himself at lunch, no friends, and thick-head, thick-necked bullies pushing him around. But if not for the bully mashing his face against the school bus window that one day, he might never have seen the barefoot running boy, who only goes by the handle ""Mullet Fingers (Cody Linley) a blond streak, faster than anybody. And if he had never seen the running boy, he might never have met bully-beating Beatrice (played by Brie Larson). And if he had never met Beatrice, he might never have discovered the burrowing owls living in a nearby lot. And if not for the owls, he probably would have missed out quite an adventure.  Hoot is the story of an ecological mystery, with a Florida setting and pro-environment, anti-development message made up of endangered miniature owls, heartless developers scheduled to be built over their burrows, and the owls' unlikely allies--three middle school kids determined to beat the system, getting grown-up attention and save some owls.TV Director Wil Shriner (Frasier) keeps Hiaasen's tougue in cheek story funny and loose, thanks in part to Tim Blake Nelson as the contractor and Luke Wilson is at his dimmest as the inept cop.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[7, 7]","""Hoot"" tells the story of three unlikely heroes, Roy, Bea, and Mullet Fingers (Logan Lerman, Brie Larson, and Cody Linley, respectively), who attempt to thwart the construction of a new pancake house in Florida on land that is inhabited by federally-protected burrowing owls.  Young Roy has just moved to Florida with his family from Montana.  As is with most tween-aged tales, he's an outcast who gets bullied, picked on, etc.  Through a series of funny events he becomes good friends with the bully who bullies bullies, Beatrice, and her tree-hugging brother, Mullet Fingers.  Up until the point where the three begin working together, Mullet Fingers has done the bulk of the dirty work at the jobsite by sabotaging contractor Curly's (Tim Blake Nelson) survey stakes, releasing cottonmouths on the property, and a few other things.  When Roy enters the picture, evidence is uncovered that will shut down the construction completely.  Of course, the main problem is that they are just three kids.  Who'll listen to them?As the story rolls along we get to meet ""buffoon-in-blue"" Delinko (gamely played by Luke Wilson) and Roy's cool science teacher, Mr. Ryan (Jimmy Buffett).  Robert Wagner shows up in a brief but funny role as the city mayor.  The cameras also give us a healthy dose of Florida's beautiful beaches and the swamp and her creatures that Mullet Fingers loves so much.Some have stated that this movie promotes eco-terrorism and they do have a little bit of an honest gripe.  What Mullet Fingers does is illegal, but so is what the pancake house is attempting to do.  Both sides are wrong in the matter, but Roy's use of the legal system shows the viewer that stealing dozer seats and tearing out specific pages of a document eventually prove to be empty ventures.  In short, eco-terrorism ideals are present, but they are shown to not be the solution to the problem.Unlike a few other reviewers here, I'm glad that the owls received only a little screen time.  This only enhanced the fact that they are endangered and worth protecting.Overall, the movie does a good job of entertaining the entire family.  It is somewhat generic as far as tweener tales go, but it is very likeable as a whole.  I think I caught only one or two brief slips of the tongue in the whole movie.  There's only a little onscreen violence involving a bully and Roy and some hilarious offscreen violence involving Bea and the same bully.  The film has plenty of laughs for all ages and the cast does a pretty good job with their respective roles.

I saw the movie and watched this DVD. I realized why so many grown up critics were down on this movie. It probably because they are adults that they expect the kids in the movie to come up to adult solutions to the problem. What make this an entertaining movie is that the kids come up with solutions that kids usually come up with. Sure they don't show great judgment many times. Mullet Finger, the barefooted blond boy, act like who he is, single mindedly trying to save the owls against great odds as a kid would do, not as adult would do which so many of these critics want him to behave. His actions and behavior are pretty close to what a kid in his situation would do, a runaway, living away from his legal guardian and basically being a barefooted wild child. But he's trying to do the right thing and that is the important factor.I thought the story overall, was weaker then the book itself. Mullet was soften considerably to make him bit more likable on the screen. I wasn't too impressed by the lead actor, Logan Lerman who I thought was bit wooden but Brie Larson and Cody Linley both made up for it. The movie was directed by Wil Shriner and he didn't exactly shine very brightly. The movie muddled from time to time. Shriner's treatment of the adult characters of the movie proves to be one of the weak links of the movie. Luke Wilson who played the bumbling police officer proves to be seriously mishandled by the director.But overall, this movie proves to be quite entertaining and enjoyable for the entire family as long as its understood that these are kids trying to save the owls from a giant pancake company and not adults with all the correct answers at their finger tips. While some of the initial delaying tactics may not be socially correct by the law, the children of the movie gradually do evolved their tactics to a more acceptable ones as they learned to adjust and adapt into taking more responsible methods. I think that what make this movie work in the end for me.Hoot DVD proves to be quite good.

In this case, it is the nefarious pancake house chain versus the nesting habitat for a few burrowing owls (active nests are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, a federal law).  The kids overcome the school bully, the pancake house thugs, and the local police to save the owls.You don't learn a lot about burrowing owls, and I suspect there is more information on owls in the book.

Good character actors filling the major adult roles, with Jimmy Buffet playing the teacher (not that most of my students knew of him!).  Nonetheless, it was a treat for me.
