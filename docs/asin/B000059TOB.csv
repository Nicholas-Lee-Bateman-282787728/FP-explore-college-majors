There's lots of gratuitous nudity, campy laughs, and some blood. Mary Woronov steals the show as a diva actress with a foul mouth. She gets the best lines in the movie and delivers them terrifically. The only thing I didn't like about Hollywood Boulevard was that it was uneven at times, and it could have been funnier.

I was surprised to see Hollywood Boulevard get better treatment on DVD than some better quality films (As of this writing Citizen Kane has not been released on DVD) but that just makes this release all the more fun. The 3-way commentary by Joe Dante (Gremlins), Allan Arkush and Jon Davidson is what DVD commentaries are all about. They're funny, informative, and quite forthcoming with their feelings towards the film. An interesting passage occurs during Candice Rialson's rape scene. Everybody gets quiet. Clearly all were embarrassed by the scene. So much so they didn't know what to say except that all films of this nature had the obligatory rape scene.

There is some humor and wit on hand here that was an ingredient of Corman's quickies.  Gratuitous nudity and violence, natch.  It just seems that the movie runs out of steam too quickly.

No. It's a Roger Corman movie and he pokes fun at Hollywood and himself in this oddball look at the rise (?) of an aspiring actress.Here's the scoop. Candy Hope (get it? Hope?) is a hayseed come to Hollywood to make it big and fulfill her dreams. She hooks up with the lowest of low-budget movie companies, an equally low-rent agent (Dick Miller) and her personal Odyssey begins. A problem arises in that some of the people involved in the movies she's making begin to die off. Murder? Will she solve the puzzle? Will she reach stardom?This is a fun watch. There are a lot of in jokes about the industry as well Corman's penchant for not spending a dime he doesn't have to. One of the movies Candy is in is a WIP film being shot in the Philippines, where Corman uses footage from his earlier WIP films shot in the Philippines. He uses some of the footage from ""Death Race 2000"" as well as some of the cars from that flick to fill in in this flick. Dick Miller is a natural and they give hime some really funny lines. Paul Bartel, as the director, is a hoot. Likewise, he gets some great lines whereby he tries to justify his making of these awful films. Mary Woronov, with her impossibly long, gorgeous legs, is on hand as the studio's top actress. Candice Rialson as Candy, along with the other three do a decent job, and they all get the joke.

This can be largely attributed to the fact that most all the films she starred in during her brief career in the '70s are either hard to find on DVD or not available at all. Candice deserved better, and so did her films. Luckily, this release of ""Hollywood Boulevard"" (and Code Red's special edition of ""Pets"") is presented looking fantastic and contains extras (including commentary by director and film historian Joe Dante) that give us some insight to the sort of actor and human being Candice was. Of all her performances, ""Boulevard"" is second only to the ultra-rare ""Chatterbox"" in terms of displaying this woman's abilities.

There are dirt, scratches, specks and cigarette burns (for the reel change) and it adds to the fun! Its all about cheap film making. More of grindhouse/drive-in type print.

Candy is another naive starlet wanna-be, who is determined to carve out an acting career in Hollywood. She gets her wish, and signs a contract with Miracle Pictures. They're a dubious outfit, that churns out sleazy tits-and-ass flicks.Candice finds herself cast in these low-grade films at Miracle, along with other voluptuous, budding young actresses. Veteran actress for Miracle, Mary McQueen, is a ferocious prima donna. And she doesn't take kindly, to competition from Candy and the other actresses working for Miracle.Suddenly, several of the actresses at Miracle, start getting murdered, one-by-one. Meanwhile Candy, disgusted by the cavalier attitude of the head honchos at Miracle about the killings, wants to give-up stardom altogether. But Candy also finds her own life in danger, and gets embroiled in finding the culprit, responsible for slaying the other actresses.Much like the film Airplane was a spoof of all those 70s airport movies, Hollywood Boulevard works brilliantly, as a parody of 70s B movies.
