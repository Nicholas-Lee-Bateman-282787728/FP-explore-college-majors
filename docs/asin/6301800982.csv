268822,AAAAJPG5Z1TLS,6301800982,Charla Johnson,"[11, 11]","This was a rather strange movie. But, with both Bette Davis and Robert Wagner in it, it held my attention. Bette Davis plays an interesting part. Like always, she puts everything into it. I'd watch anything with Bette Davis, however, I would recommend this one to anyone. It is a spy/suspense movie. I believe it was made as a pilot to a TV series but ended up being shown as a TV movie. Bette Davis is superb at becoming whatever it is she needs to be at the time. In this movie, she is rather bizarre but as always captivating.",3,It's Different!,1195171200,"11 16, 2007",2007,529,"['was', 'rather', 'strange', 'movie', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'held', 'attention', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'interesting', 'part', 'always', 'everything', ""'d"", 'watch', 'anything', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'however', 'would', 'recommend', 'one', 'anyone', 'spy/suspense', 'movie', 'believe', 'was', 'made', 'pilot', 'TV', 'series', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'shown', 'TV', 'movie', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'superb', 'becoming', 'whatever', 'be', 'time', 'movie', 'rather', 'bizarre', 'always', 'captivating']",Madame Sin VHS
268823,A2CKMDS10RKS50,6301800982,Chris,"[0, 0]","This is one of Bette Davis' later movies made for television. She actually has a secondary role with Robert Wagner playing the main character. It's a sort of espionage/sci-fi mix. Bette's character is a Bond villain wannabe. Not to be taken seriously, it requires a great deal of suspension of belief. Davis and Wagner were probably both in it mainly for the paycheck. A guilty pleasure for fans of these two stars.",3,Bette for TV,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,415,"['one', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'later', 'movies', 'made', 'television', 'actually', 'secondary', 'role', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'playing', 'main', 'character', 'sort', 'espionage/sci-fi', 'mix', 'Bette', 'character', 'Bond', 'villain', 'wannabe', 'Not', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'great', 'deal', 'suspension', 'belief', 'Davis', 'Wagner', 'were', 'probably', 'mainly', 'paycheck', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'fans', 'two', 'stars']",Madame Sin VHS

I have been a bette Davis fan for many years and I have seen photos of her in costume of Madame sin but never saw the movie. Well I noticed it was released on DVD this month and immediately ordered it. Though I am not a fan of movies done in the 60's or 70's, I am thrilled with this movie. It was fun and interesting and Bette Davis truly gave her character a look all on its own. If you are a Bette Davis fan, you may want to ad this to your collection. I was thrilled I did.",5,"Such Fun, Such Joy",1392508800,"02 16, 2014",2014,556,"['have', 'been', 'dying', 'day', 'i', 'could', 'finally', 'get', 'hands', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'bette', 'Davis', 'fan', 'many', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'photos', 'costume', 'Madame', 'sin', 'never', 'saw', 'movie', 'Well', 'noticed', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'month', 'immediately', 'ordered', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'movies', 'done', '60', '70', 'am', 'thrilled', 'movie', 'was', 'fun', 'interesting', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'truly', 'gave', 'character', 'look', 'own', 'are', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'fan', 'may', 'want', 'ad', 'collection', 'was', 'thrilled', 'did']",Madame Sin VHS
268826,A1NSDP9YZXLMDX,6301800982,Russell S,"[0, 0]","So here we have complete camp from Bette Davis playing Madame Sin and having a ball doing it too. She is terrific.  The story, however, drags big time. Madame Sin needs a Polaris Sub for one of her nefarious clients and she enlists ex-God only knows what agent (since the untimely death of his wife he doesn't care) and by enlists I mean she kidnaps him. he refuses, he changes his mind, he learns the truth...blah, blah. Robert Wagner as the agent, is awful, Denholm Elliot as Madame Sin's main hatchet guy is unconvincing, the story...who cares. the only reason to watch this is Bette Davis. So if you want to just go into a vegetative state to have some fun...try it but realize what you are getting into.",3,Love Bette!,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,708,"['So', 'here', 'have', 'complete', 'camp', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'playing', 'Madame', 'Sin', 'having', 'ball', 'doing', 'too', 'terrific', 'story', 'however', 'big', 'time', 'Madame', 'Sin', 'Polaris', 'Sub', 'one', 'nefarious', 'clients', 'ex-God', 'only', 'what', 'agent', 'untimely', 'death', 'wife', ""n't"", 'care', 'enlists', 'mean', 'mind', 'truth', 'blah', 'blah', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'agent', 'awful', 'Denholm', 'Elliot', 'Madame', 'Sin', 'main', 'hatchet', 'guy', 'unconvincing', 'story', 'who', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'So', 'want', 'just', 'go', 'vegetative', 'state', 'have', 'fun', 'try', 'realize', 'what', 'are', 'getting']",Madame Sin VHS
268827,ACT1EPHFS9E7V,6301800982,true crime reader,"[1, 1]",This is a very unusual roll for Bette Davis. She play's a very evil woman who wants to run the world. And she doesn't care who she has killed to do it. She kidnappes important people then brain washes them to do what she wants them to do to help her get what she wants. She kidnapp's Robert Wagner to help her steal a submarine that she wants. She get's him to help kidnap a Navy offical who is in charge of moving the sub & gets him to stear the sub to where she wants it.It is a good movie. I was surprised that it was any good at all. I only bought it because Bette was in it but I was very glad I did.
