939993,A3GKU0NILLHDWQ,B000BC8SL0,A. Hickman,"[11, 11]","Dusty Springfield performed live all too infrequently, especially in the second half of her career. Even less frequently did she appear before the camera.  So these few moments caught on film are especially poignant.  This performance, before Princess Margaret at the Royal Albert Hall, has a thrown-together feel, and Dusty doesn't always look like she knows what to do with the stage, but the rapport she establishes with her fans is immediate and real.  I like the drama she brings to a song like ""Quite Please, There's a Lady on Stage,"" a song she never recorded for an album and which was written by Peter Allen with Judy Garland in mind, but which provided the perfect coda to what was essentially a comeback performance, following her decade-long ""exile"" in America.  But it's the hits that her fans want to hear, and she delivers these in spades.  From ""I Close My Eyes and Count to Ten"" to ""You Don't Have to Say You Love Me,"" her catalog is among the most recognizable in the history of pop (for insights into her career, one couldn't ask for more than the interviews with Pat Rhodes, Simon Bell, and others on the DVD).  She looks great; she sounds great; and the songs hold up.  So put your hands together and enjoy.",4,There's a Lady on Stage,1139529600,"02 10, 2006",2006,1228,"['Dusty', 'Springfield', 'performed', 'live', 'too', 'infrequently', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'career', 'Even', 'less', 'frequently', 'did', 'appear', 'camera', 'few', 'moments', 'caught', 'film', 'are', 'especially', 'poignant', 'performance', 'Princess', 'Margaret', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'thrown-together', 'feel', 'Dusty', ""n't"", 'always', 'look', 'what', 'do', 'stage', 'rapport', 'fans', 'immediate', 'real', 'drama', 'song', 'Quite', 'Please', 'Lady', 'Stage', 'song', 'never', 'recorded', 'album', 'was', 'written', 'Peter', 'Allen', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'mind', 'provided', 'perfect', 'coda', 'what', 'was', 'essentially', 'comeback', 'performance', 'following', 'decade-long', 'exile', 'America', 'hits', 'fans', 'want', 'hear', 'spades', 'Close', 'My', 'Eyes', 'Count', 'Ten', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Have', 'Say', 'Love', 'catalog', 'most', 'recognizable', 'history', 'pop', 'insights', 'career', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'ask', 'more', 'interviews', 'Pat', 'Rhodes', 'Simon', 'Bell', 'others', 'DVD', 'great', 'great', 'songs', 'hold', 'up', 'So', 'put', 'hands', 'together', 'enjoy']",N/A

Jenkins,"[3, 4]","You can find a dozen flaws in this very rare presentation - a poorly rehearsed and conducted orchestra, poor stage management, abysmal lighting, glitches and gaffes galore, but in the end this DVD is a joy. If you're a lifelong Dusty fan your heart may burst. What a great woman, what a great girl, what an extraordinary talent. She's in fine and somewhat silly form, looks SENSATIONAL, and that voice... beyond description.She's obviously enjoying herself here, and her loose delivery and sense of fun is thrilling to watch. Imagine a female version of Rod Stewart's easy command of the stage and bond with the audience. It's almost impossible to believe that this woman was insecure about anything.The DVD looks and sounds great considering the year it was recorded, but what carries the night is a stellar and warm performance.As was universally said in the overseas press when she passed, Dusty was and remains the finest female vocalist that England ever produced... perhaps the finest produced by the English speaking world. We shall never see her like again. She was the Beatles of the ""chick singers.""At least, one hopes, she knew how deeply people loved her, as is evident by the number of people jumping onstage to hug her at the end of the show.Rest in peace, dear sweet Dusty.",5,Heartwrenching and Joyous,1159401600,"09 28, 2006",2006,1288,"['can', 'find', 'dozen', 'flaws', 'very', 'rare', 'presentation', 'poorly', 'rehearsed', 'conducted', 'orchestra', 'poor', 'stage', 'management', 'abysmal', 'lighting', 'glitches', 'gaffes', 'galore', 'end', 'DVD', 'joy', ""'re"", 'lifelong', 'Dusty', 'fan', 'heart', 'may', 'burst', 'What', 'great', 'woman', 'what', 'great', 'girl', 'what', 'extraordinary', 'talent', 'fine', 'somewhat', 'silly', 'form', 'SENSATIONAL', 'voice', 'description.She', 'obviously', 'enjoying', 'here', 'loose', 'delivery', 'sense', 'fun', 'thrilling', 'watch', 'Imagine', 'female', 'version', 'Rod', 'Stewart', 'easy', 'command', 'stage', 'bond', 'audience', 'almost', 'impossible', 'believe', 'woman', 'was', 'insecure', 'anything.The', 'DVD', 'great', 'considering', 'year', 'was', 'recorded', 'what', 'night', 'stellar', 'warm', 'performance.As', 'was', 'universally', 'said', 'overseas', 'press', 'when', 'passed', 'Dusty', 'was', 'finest', 'female', 'vocalist', 'England', 'ever', 'produced', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'produced', 'English', 'speaking', 'world', 'shall', 'never', 'see', 'like', 'again', 'was', 'Beatles', 'chick', 'singers', 'least', 'one', 'hopes', 'knew', 'how', 'deeply', 'people', 'loved', 'evident', 'number', 'people', 'jumping', 'onstage', 'hug', 'end', 'show.Rest', 'peace', 'dear', 'sweet', 'Dusty']",N/A
939995,A1BUAA7C79XAXY,B000BC8SL0,"Fredric A. Cooper ""Hollies fan""","[9, 11]","I have mixed feelings about this performance. Filmed for British TV in 1979, ten years after Dusty's last chart hit, there is an air of ""lounge act"" to this show, with its medley of hits and her covers of trendy disco tunes that she felt obliged to include here (it would have been better had she sung Pattie Brooks' great ""After Dark"", where Brooks sounds uncannily like Dusty.) Dusty recorded some interesting things around this time period, and she could have done justice to a few of her recent recordings, but she chose not to, and instead did a couple of ballads which are effective, but a bit sad (especially one where she sings about not being the latest rage). For a show that apparently was a big deal, with the Queen in attendance, Dusty giggles through a few tunes, including ""The Look of Love"", spoiling the mood. Despite all this, it's interesting to see how the audience clearly loves her. It's too bad there are no shows available from her 1960s TV show. I have a bootleg copy of one of them, and although the quality isn't great, the performances are, with Dusty in her prime, complete with the high hairdos and black makeup, singing incredibly, gesturing enthusiastically, and even playing guitar (on the lovely ""Wayfaring Stranger""). It wasn't until the Pet Shop Boys brought her back into the spotlight with ""What Have I Done to Deserve This"" in 1987 that we got to see & hear Dusty in top form again, which led to several more hits (""Nothing Has Been Proved"", ""In Private"" and ""Reputation""). This concert, while good to see once, isn't really essential, but nevertheless noteworthy for having been a rare chance to see and hear the legend in concert, even at this rather awkward date.",3,"Dusty in fine voice, but...",1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,1705,"['have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'performance', 'Filmed', 'British', 'TV', '1979', 'ten', 'years', 'Dusty', 'last', 'chart', 'hit', 'air', 'lounge', 'act', 'show', 'medley', 'hits', 'covers', 'trendy', 'disco', 'tunes', 'felt', 'obliged', 'include', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'sung', 'Pattie', 'Brooks', 'great', 'Dark', 'where', 'Brooks', 'uncannily', 'Dusty', 'Dusty', 'recorded', 'interesting', 'things', 'time', 'period', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'justice', 'few', 'recent', 'recordings', 'chose', 'not', 'instead', 'did', 'couple', 'ballads', 'are', 'effective', 'bit', 'sad', 'especially', 'one', 'where', 'not', 'being', 'latest', 'rage', 'show', 'apparently', 'was', 'big', 'deal', 'Queen', 'attendance', 'Dusty', 'few', 'tunes', 'including', 'Look', 'Love', 'spoiling', 'mood', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'audience', 'clearly', 'too', 'bad', 'are', 'shows', 'available', '1960s', 'TV', 'show', 'have', 'bootleg', 'copy', 'one', 'quality', ""n't"", 'great', 'performances', 'are', 'Dusty', 'prime', 'complete', 'high', 'hairdos', 'black', 'makeup', 'singing', 'incredibly', 'gesturing', 'enthusiastically', 'even', 'playing', 'guitar', 'lovely', 'Wayfaring', 'Stranger', 'was', ""n't"", 'Pet', 'Shop', 'Boys', 'brought', 'back', 'spotlight', 'What', 'Have', 'Done', 'Deserve', '1987', 'got', 'see', 'hear', 'Dusty', 'top', 'form', 'again', 'led', 'several', 'more', 'hits', 'Nothing', 'Has', 'Been', 'Proved', 'Private', 'Reputation', 'concert', 'good', 'see', 'once', ""n't"", 'really', 'essential', 'nevertheless', 'noteworthy', 'having', 'been', 'rare', 'chance', 'see', 'hear', 'legend', 'concert', 'even', 'rather', 'awkward', 'date']",N/A
939996,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B000BC8SL0,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[5, 6]","Born in 1939, girl next door Mary O'Brien reinvented herself as Dusty Springfield just in time for London's swinging sixties, and at the time her hairstyles, make-up, and attire were probably as influential as anything she ever recorded.  Like many singing stars of her era, she fell from grace in the 1970s, faultering in a mixture of alcohol, drugs, and sex, her recordings critically admired but barely selling.  With her 1999 death, however, came the great re-evaluation, and she is now classed among the great female vocalists of the 20th Century.  Which is why DUSTY SPRINGFIELD: LIVE AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL is such a disappointment.  You cannot help but look and listen and think of what it should be that it is not.Filmed in 1979, after she began to pull herself out of drugs and a series of nervous break downs, the concert finds Springfield offering an uninspired selection of songs, alternating between fits of disco, her most obvious hits, and condensing most of her signature songs into an extended medley.  The concert is clearly under-rehearsed, the direction utterly non-existent, and the film footage is at best commonplace.  Springfield herself is not a her best: her hairstyle is unflattering, her white harem pants are exceptionally unfortunate, and her body language seems gawky.  And her voice?  It is still there, but she seldom bothers to use it.  She performs in an almost throw-away manner, mugging for the camera and shrugging off one error after another.But a couple of things do come through very vividly, and they make this DVD worth the effort.  The first is the rapport Springfield had with her audience.  It seems obvious that there is more going on than what the camera catches: the audience is clearly mezmerized, which leads me to suspect the concert had an energy the camera simply didn't see.  And then comes the moment when Springfield changes from her hideous white costume into a more flattering lavender and returns to the stage for two encores that exploit every nuance of her vocal talents: ""Quiet Please"" and ""Put Your Hands Together.""  If the rest of the concert had been performed at the same level, it would have been a show for the ages.The DVD is perhaps most interesting for a documentary that consists of four ""talking heads"" hosted by the concert director (who admits this particular concert was under-rehearsed, indeed completely unrehearsed) and includes one of the back-up singers (who says much the same.)  The documentary is short on art, and there are many more questions that could have been asked of the subjects, but it does offer tremendous insight into who Springfield was as a private person and a public artist, and it is to be valued for that.  Taken all together, I give both concert and documentary an average of three stars.  Recommended, but pretty much for established fans only.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,The White Diamond In So-So 1979 Concert Footage,1284422400,"09 14, 2010",2010,2873,"['Born', '1939', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'Mary', ""O'Brien"", 'reinvented', 'Dusty', 'Springfield', 'just', 'time', 'London', 'swinging', 'sixties', 'time', 'hairstyles', 'make-up', 'attire', 'were', 'probably', 'as', 'influential', 'anything', 'ever', 'recorded', 'many', 'singing', 'stars', 'era', 'fell', 'grace', '1970s', 'faultering', 'mixture', 'alcohol', 'drugs', 'sex', 'recordings', 'critically', 'admired', 'barely', 'selling', '1999', 'death', 'however', 'came', 'great', 're-evaluation', 'now', 'classed', 'great', 'female', 'vocalists', '20th', 'Century', 'Which', 'why', 'DUSTY', 'SPRINGFIELD', 'LIVE', 'THE', 'ROYAL', 'ALBERT', 'HALL', 'such', 'disappointment', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'look', 'listen', 'think', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'not.Filmed', '1979', 'began', 'pull', 'drugs', 'series', 'nervous', 'break', 'downs', 'concert', 'Springfield', 'offering', 'uninspired', 'selection', 'songs', 'alternating', 'fits', 'disco', 'most', 'obvious', 'hits', 'condensing', 'most', 'signature', 'songs', 'extended', 'medley', 'concert', 'clearly', 'under-rehearsed', 'direction', 'utterly', 'non-existent', 'film', 'footage', 'best', 'commonplace', 'Springfield', 'not', 'best', 'hairstyle', 'unflattering', 'white', 'harem', 'pants', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'unfortunate', 'body', 'language', 'gawky', 'voice', 'still', 'there', 'bothers', 'use', 'almost', 'throw-away', 'manner', 'mugging', 'camera', 'shrugging', 'off', 'one', 'error', 'another.But', 'couple', 'things', 'do', 'come', 'very', 'vividly', 'make', 'DVD', 'effort', 'first', 'rapport', 'Springfield', 'had', 'audience', 'obvious', 'more', 'going', 'what', 'camera', 'audience', 'clearly', 'mezmerized', 'suspect', 'concert', 'had', 'energy', 'camera', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'then', 'moment', 'when', 'Springfield', 'changes', 'hideous', 'white', 'costume', 'more', 'flattering', 'lavender', 'returns', 'stage', 'two', 'encores', 'exploit', 'nuance', 'vocal', 'talents', 'Quiet', 'Please', 'Put', 'Hands', 'Together', 'rest', 'concert', 'had', 'been', 'performed', 'same', 'level', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'show', 'ages.The', 'DVD', 'perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'four', 'talking', 'heads', 'hosted', 'concert', 'director', 'who', 'particular', 'concert', 'was', 'under-rehearsed', 'indeed', 'completely', 'unrehearsed', 'one', 'back-up', 'singers', 'who', 'much', 'same', 'documentary', 'short', 'art', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'questions', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'asked', 'subjects', 'offer', 'tremendous', 'insight', 'who', 'Springfield', 'was', 'private', 'person', 'public', 'artist', 'be', 'valued', 'Taken', 'together', 'give', 'concert', 'documentary', 'average', 'three', 'stars', 'Recommended', 'pretty', 'much', 'established', 'fans', 'only.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

Sittig ""Divawatch""","[40, 44]","From the opening musical intro (a wonderfully tongue in cheek version of ""The Bitch is Back"", sung by her backing vocalists), to the very last notes of ""Put Your Hands Together"", this concert is a MUST see for any music fan, and of course, a total treat for anyone who calls themselves a true Dusty Springfield afficionado.The evening is full of energy and shows Dusty Springfield in the best light perhaps since her 60s hey dey.  Not since then had we seen her so relaxed, so laid-back, so fully committed to entertain her audience.And entertain she does, going through a wonderfully varied repertoire for this concert.  She covers disco (""We Are Family"", ""You Can Do It"", Grace Jones' ""On Your Knees""), delivers the big ballads she was known for (""All I See Is You"", ""I Close My Eyes and Count To Ten"", ""You Don't Have To Say You Love Me""), delivers a rousing medley of her well known hits, (starting with a mesmerizing few lines of Carole King's ""Goin' Back"") and as if that weren't enough, she throws in a few brilliant covers of Karla Bonoff's ""Lose Again"" (made popular by Linda Ronstadt) and Peter Allen's ""Quiet Please, There's A Lady On Stage"" in which she reaches Judy Garland-like proportions of showwomanship.The picture quality is absolutely AMAZING and I love the Main Menu and the other Menus graphics..great sound effects and wonderful pictures of the White Queen of Soul. The sound quality is not as strong as the picture quality, but I guess they did the best they could with what was available on the master tapes.Dusty looks radiant and performs majestically! The liner notes are actually quite good this time (in my view) and they capture perfectly the spirit of the concert. Dusty does seem more laid-back than ever on this one and yes, there are several small glitches and hiccups vocally as well as technically, but nothing major...and whatever precision is lost is made up for with a wonderful energy and enthusiasm that's wonderful to see.The interviews are also fantastic..especially Pat Rhodes, Madeleine Bell and Simon Bell. Simon almost made me cry on several occasions, especially towards the end, when it was clear he was also moved and missing Dusty. He is a great guy, and it's clear to see why Dusty wanted him near in her final days.While Springfield seems to excel at the ballads, what is most surprising is to watch her take command of her audience with an assurance and strength that is still encased in a warm, vulnerable glow.  No one else but perhaps a Garland or maybe a Piaf, could make 3,000 people feel as if she was singing only to each of them...individually.  That sort of ability is a rare thing indeed, and Dusty Springfield shows it fully during this concert.  She has every single audience member in the palm of her hand from beginning to end.  This is not something you see very frequently nowadays from a performer.  It is something of legend, indeed.",5,The Bitch is Back!,1130976000,"11 3, 2005",2005,2906,"['opening', 'musical', 'intro', 'wonderfully', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'version', 'Bitch', 'Back', 'sung', 'backing', 'vocalists', 'very', 'last', 'notes', 'Put', 'Hands', 'Together', 'concert', 'MUST', 'see', 'music', 'fan', 'course', 'total', 'treat', 'anyone', 'who', 'true', 'Dusty', 'Springfield', 'afficionado.The', 'evening', 'full', 'energy', 'Dusty', 'Springfield', 'best', 'light', 'perhaps', '60s', 'hey', 'dey', 'Not', 'then', 'had', 'seen', 'so', 'relaxed', 'so', 'laid-back', 'so', 'fully', 'committed', 'entertain', 'audience.And', 'entertain', 'going', 'wonderfully', 'varied', 'repertoire', 'concert', 'disco', 'Are', 'Family', 'Can', 'Do', 'Grace', 'Jones', 'Knees', 'big', 'ballads', 'was', 'known', 'See', 'Close', 'My', 'Eyes', 'Count', 'Ten', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Have', 'Say', 'Love', 'Me', 'rousing', 'medley', 'well', 'known', 'hits', 'starting', 'mesmerizing', 'few', 'lines', 'Carole', 'King', 'Goin', 'Back', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'few', 'brilliant', 'covers', 'Karla', 'Bonoff', 'Lose', 'Again', 'made', 'popular', 'Linda', 'Ronstadt', 'Peter', 'Allen', 'Quiet', 'Please', 'A', 'Lady', 'Stage', 'Judy', 'Garland-like', 'proportions', 'showwomanship.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'absolutely', 'AMAZING', 'love', 'Main', 'Menu', 'other', 'Menus', 'graphics..great', 'sound', 'effects', 'wonderful', 'pictures', 'White', 'Queen', 'Soul', 'sound', 'quality', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'picture', 'quality', 'guess', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'what', 'was', 'available', 'master', 'tapes.Dusty', 'radiant', 'performs', 'majestically', 'liner', 'notes', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'time', 'view', 'capture', 'perfectly', 'spirit', 'concert', 'Dusty', 'seem', 'more', 'laid-back', 'ever', 'one', 'yes', 'are', 'several', 'small', 'glitches', 'hiccups', 'vocally', 'as', 'well', 'technically', 'nothing', 'major', 'precision', 'lost', 'made', 'up', 'wonderful', 'energy', 'enthusiasm', 'wonderful', 'see.The', 'interviews', 'are', 'also', 'fantastic..especially', 'Pat', 'Rhodes', 'Madeleine', 'Bell', 'Simon', 'Bell', 'Simon', 'almost', 'made', 'cry', 'several', 'occasions', 'especially', 'end', 'when', 'was', 'clear', 'was', 'also', 'moved', 'missing', 'Dusty', 'great', 'guy', 'clear', 'see', 'why', 'Dusty', 'wanted', 'final', 'days.While', 'Springfield', 'excel', 'ballads', 'what', 'most', 'surprising', 'watch', 'take', 'command', 'audience', 'assurance', 'strength', 'still', 'encased', 'warm', 'vulnerable', 'glow', 'one', 'else', 'perhaps', 'Garland', 'maybe', 'Piaf', 'could', 'make', '3,000', 'people', 'feel', 'was', 'singing', 'only', 'individually', 'sort', 'ability', 'rare', 'thing', 'indeed', 'Dusty', 'Springfield', 'fully', 'concert', 'single', 'audience', 'member', 'palm', 'hand', 'beginning', 'end', 'not', 'something', 'see', 'very', 'frequently', 'performer', 'something', 'legend', 'indeed']",N/A

While it's great to get any Dusty on DVD I have heard her sound much better than this on bootleg DVDs and from the great Reflections DVD.  This show seems a bit rushed, and not up to par.  The medley is great as is Son Of A preacher Man and some others, but the disco tunes are simply annoying and ruin the whole mood.  They are just noisy and don't fit Dusty at all.

I didn't enjoy her disco covers,particularly ""We are family"".In looking back it is the soulful less obvious songs she performs that make Dusty special.Nuance is her forte.  A big concert arena is not Dusty's best showcase.Dusty looks good,(80's style) and is a bit thin.She is emotionally charged and  set to capture the royal  ""Queen"" audience.(An inside joke to this concert) Her covers of ""goin' Back"", ""Son of a preacher man, and her hits medley are engaging and satisfying.I am one of the few who don't crave to hear her motown-related songs.I think she is a born balladeer.I would have loved to see Dusty in a less ""oldies"" and mor contemporary setting. Some of the song selections are just plain boring..Her ""put your hands together"", and Peter Allens' ""there's a lady on stage"" are not up to the singers talent.They reflect a period of mor 70's music that was thin,contrived and glossy.I was suprised Dusty didn't percieve this,as she was known for her fastidiousness.Her Johnny Franz record productions were her best setting for her sensitive instrument.All in all it is very fortunate to see her at all, with the limited video on Dusty.If you watch and listen close you can catch the talent that made her best studio recordings.The commentary of friends is a special edition to the dvd that let's us into the private Dusty Springfield.
