It depicts twenty-four hours in the lives of a group of people whose lives intertwine in surprising ways.Isabel (Elizabeth Banks) is a somewhat naieve 20-something aspiring photographer, engaged to be married within a month to her controlling, yuppie attorney husband, Jonathan (James Marsters).  The timing is not good when Isabel runs into former boyfriend Mark, who is still interested in her and gets her offered a professional dream job out of the country.Meanwhile, Isabel's mother, Diane (Glenn Close) is a well-known actress/director/drama coach, assertive and confident professionally but who feels her personal life is out of control.  She's not really comfortable about Isabel's impending wedding to Jonathan, and is suffering through the end of her own marriage to a philandering spouse who is having an affair with her own understudy (played by Isabella Rossellini).  At an audition for a play she will direct, she becomes somewhat interested in handsome young actor Alec (Jesse Bradford), and invites him to accompany her to a rehearsal of her own play.  Coming in to ""stir the pot"" a bit is a journalist doing a magazine spread on a famous male photographer, who is equally infamous for seducing his models.A masterful tapestry of an ensemble drama by first time director Chris Terrio, adapted from a play by Amy Fox.  Very realistic Manhattan vibe, including lots of scenes on building rooftops.  Our local paper's review failed to disclose the significant (and climatic) gay/bisexual plot lines, which made for some surprised viewers at the showing I attended.

935847,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000B5IOX4,C. B Collins Jr.,"[4, 4]","This is a tightly constructed film that covers the lives of 5 characters over the course of a single day. Whereas the film starts with the characters feeling apparently satisfied with their lives and relationships, all this changes as old bonds are examined and broken and new bonds are created.There are three primary themes of the film that are centered around three of the main characters. The first theme is resiliency as expressed by the young photographer Isabel, played by Elizabeth Banks; the second theme is human limitations as expressed by her famous mother, Diana, played by Glenn Close; and the third theme is denial of the self as expressed by Isabel's boy-friend Jonathan, played by James Marsden.Isabel, the daughter of a famous actress and director, has become a photographer and with her camera as her shield, she trys to capture the lives of real humans. I say 'real humans' because Isabel comes from a world of sophistication, wealth, and privilege. She is engaged to her live-in boyfriend, the charming, sweet, handsome, smart Jonathan. Yet, as the film progresses things tend to go very wrong and the complexity of human nature and the multifaceted nature of human desire begins to reveal that every character is not as they seem.Elisabeth Banks plays Isabel and does a great job of showing her taking an unexpected look at her lover, and then quickly following her instincts to move beyond her crisis toward situating herself for meeting her own needs.James Marsden plays Jonathan, an attentive bright young man that is unable to determine his genuine needs. In many ways he is the emotionally weakest character in the film for he aspires to illusions of happiness rather than happiness,and despite his incredible male beauty, is highly dependent upon others.It is with Glenn Close as Diana that more mature viewers may identify. She is incredibly successful, mature, talented, connected, and yet fragile to the point of being brittle when her younger husband brings his new lover to a cocktail party at their home. However, when her daughter is on the verge of making a major mistake by her planned marriage to Jonathan, Diana becomes a Lioness protecting her cub. Despite her theatrical talents, she is limited in how she is able to express her motherly affection for Isabel. But she does try and Isabel realizes her mother is there for her when she needs her. In some ways the pivotal point of the film is not that Isabel discovers that Jonathan is not who she thought he was but rather than her mother, despite her emotional limitations in her personal life, is exactly who she needs.The film is thoughtful and sophisticated. George Segal offers the film's best moments of comedy as a well meaning but goofy elderly Rabbi. Jesse Bradford as the young actor Alec is also excellent in his role as the catalyst that pulls our main characters apart so that they can rebuild again.",4,24 hours can change everything,1186876800,"08 12, 2007",2007,2903,"['tightly', 'constructed', 'film', 'lives', '5', 'characters', 'course', 'single', 'day', 'film', 'characters', 'feeling', 'apparently', 'satisfied', 'lives', 'relationships', 'changes', 'old', 'bonds', 'are', 'examined', 'broken', 'new', 'bonds', 'are', 'created.There', 'are', 'three', 'primary', 'themes', 'film', 'are', 'centered', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'first', 'theme', 'resiliency', 'expressed', 'young', 'photographer', 'Isabel', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'second', 'theme', 'human', 'limitations', 'expressed', 'famous', 'mother', 'Diana', 'played', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'third', 'theme', 'denial', 'self', 'expressed', 'Isabel', 'boy-friend', 'Jonathan', 'played', 'James', 'Marsden.Isabel', 'daughter', 'famous', 'actress', 'director', 'become', 'photographer', 'camera', 'shield', 'trys', 'capture', 'lives', 'real', 'humans', 'say', ""'real"", 'humans', 'Isabel', 'world', 'sophistication', 'wealth', 'privilege', 'engaged', 'live-in', 'boyfriend', 'charming', 'sweet', 'handsome', 'smart', 'Jonathan', 'Yet', 'film', 'things', 'tend', 'go', 'very', 'wrong', 'complexity', 'human', 'nature', 'multifaceted', 'nature', 'human', 'desire', 'reveal', 'character', 'not', 'seem.Elisabeth', 'Banks', 'plays', 'Isabel', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'taking', 'unexpected', 'look', 'lover', 'then', 'quickly', 'following', 'instincts', 'move', 'crisis', 'situating', 'meeting', 'own', 'needs.James', 'Marsden', 'plays', 'Jonathan', 'attentive', 'bright', 'young', 'man', 'unable', 'determine', 'genuine', 'needs', 'many', 'ways', 'emotionally', 'weakest', 'character', 'film', 'illusions', 'happiness', 'rather', 'happiness', 'incredible', 'male', 'beauty', 'highly', 'dependent', 'others.It', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Diana', 'more', 'mature', 'viewers', 'may', 'identify', 'incredibly', 'successful', 'mature', 'talented', 'connected', 'yet', 'fragile', 'point', 'being', 'brittle', 'when', 'younger', 'husband', 'new', 'lover', 'cocktail', 'party', 'home', 'However', 'when', 'daughter', 'verge', 'making', 'major', 'mistake', 'planned', 'marriage', 'Jonathan', 'Diana', 'Lioness', 'protecting', 'cub', 'theatrical', 'talents', 'limited', 'how', 'able', 'express', 'motherly', 'affection', 'Isabel', 'try', 'Isabel', 'mother', 'there', 'when', 'ways', 'pivotal', 'point', 'film', 'not', 'Isabel', 'Jonathan', 'not', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'rather', 'mother', 'emotional', 'limitations', 'personal', 'life', 'exactly', 'who', 'needs.The', 'film', 'thoughtful', 'sophisticated', 'George', 'Segal', 'film', 'best', 'moments', 'comedy', 'well', 'meaning', 'goofy', 'elderly', 'Rabbi', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'young', 'actor', 'Alec', 'also', 'excellent', 'role', 'catalyst', 'main', 'characters', 'apart', 'can', 'rebuild', 'again']",Heights
935848,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000B5IOX4,Grady Harp,"[12, 13]","Often a film succeeds because of the story, or the writing, or the cast, or the direction. HEIGHTS succeeds brilliantly because of the combination of all of these elements in one of the finest films of the past few years.  Beginning with the play and screenplay by Amy Fox, and as carefully and lovingly directed by Chris Terrio with a sterling cast,  this film works its subtle magic of a story about serendipity and coincidences and how these alter our lives by accidental occurrences. Or are they accidental?Each of the well-drawn characters in this story is functioning at a level that involves the masks behind which we each hide our personal secrets or idiosyncrasies: each character is either at a 'height' or approaching one, and it is the interplay of these disparate people that creates phrases of music which ultimately combine in a series of themes and variations like a well-composed work of chamber music.  And this all occurs within a twenty-four hour period in Manhattan.Diana (Glenn Close) is the reigning New York actress currently preparing a production of 'Macbeth' with friend director Henry (Eric Bagosian) while simultaneously giving Master Classes at Julliard to a group of acting students who she declares lack passion!  Diana's 'height' is challenged by her current anxiety over her open-marriage husband's rather serious affair with one of her students.  She holds auditions and a young, struggling,  and handsome actor Alec (Jesse Bradford) catches her interest and she sees in him the passion she craves and invites him to her party that evening. Alec, fearful of his chance at his 'height', hesitantly accepts.Meanwhile Diana's photographer daughter Isabel (Elizabeth Banks) is fired from her portrait job only to be offered an important  gig in Eastern Europe by an ex-lover, offering Isabel a chance at her own 'height'.  Isabel is engaged to young ambitious lawyer Jonathan (James Marsden remembered for this superb acting in 'The 24th Day') who in preparing to marry a non-Jew is in counseling with his Rabbi (George Segal): there are obviously stresses on the incipient marriage that Jonathan has not revealed.In another area of Manhattan, at Vanity Fair, Liz (Isabella Rosselini) taps reporter Peter (John Light) to do a story on a famous and gifted photographer known for bedding his nude male models.  Peter is to interview each of the models for the story, and one of those models happens to be Jonathan!The entire group comes together at Diana's party and there the secrets of each of the characters gradually surface in coincidental ways and the story of how each of these interesting but tainted people respond to discoveries makes for the resolution of the story.  Director Terrio uses finely honed techniques to slowly introduce each character, adding layers of information gradually, until the magnitude of these coincidences becomes dramatically tense and fascinating. This film is like standing in a darkroom watching a photograph slowly develop, revealing more of the details with each washing, until the final picture is filled with extraordinary details - some expected, others not. The cast is wholly superb and the degree of ensemble acting surpasses that of films of the recent past.  If there is a criticism of the film it is a minor one: the ambient sound and musical scoring at times cover the dialogue which make us strain to hear the whispered interchanges.  But this is a brilliant film that immediately assumes a role in the pantheon of fine cinematic art.  Highly recommended.

It's basically about a group of people all connected in some way or another. I think the movie is pretty good, but a little predictable in a lot of ways. It is an independent film and that is one reason I finally bought this movie. I like to support independent films because this is where we get the next new crop of great film makers.I would recommend this film as it is very interesting to see how some New Yorkers live.

How did either of these two get so famous?  They treat Diana as though she were Lee Strasberg and Spielberg put together.  And Benjamin Stone is presented as some super great Rauschenberg type artist, when the evidence shows he's nothing more than a Herb Ritts.  Half the dialogue in the movie is either, ""You mean, THE Diana Lee?"" or ""THE Benjamin Stone,"" and if I took a drink every time a character said one of these two lines I'd still be drunk three years later.  Oh well, the impossible thing to believe is the assignment Isabella Rossellini gives the English schmo about writing the Vanity Fair article and exposing Benjamin Stone's past love affairs.Peter looks pained every time he meets another of Stone's ex lovers, as though he had never known anything about them, and yet he is supposed to have been a) writing Stone's biography and b) ""dating"" Stone himself.  And Stone is famous for sleeping with his models, as all the other characters and even their pets know, so why is Peter, his boyfriend, so surprised and anguished?The movie takes place in 24 hours, right?  And in that time we see Isabella Rossellini give the assignment, and then a montage of Peter interviewing a dozen or so men.  How'd he line up all those interviews in one convenient day, it's ludicrous.  And is Rufus Wainwright supposed to be attracted to him?  Okay, maybe.I liked Elizabeth Banks but thought she was pretty vicious at the end.  Why so harsh, Isabel?  It's not like you don't have a way out.  The thing about being torn between two lovers is that you always have a fallback position, so I never got too sorry for any of the characters, especially not THE Diana Lee, crying on top of her three million dollar penthouse roof.  Give me a break, Merchant Ivory!  And yet at the same time the film is well done to a certain extent and one can never have enough Jesse Bradford or James Marsden, so everyone's a winner.Merchant Ivory is known for eclectic casting and everyone wants to be in one of their films, but is that why we see Thomas Lennon in this one (as well as in LE DIVORCE)?

When done well, these types of films are among my favorite.  By necessity, for them to be successful, they must have clever, intricate scripts or else the story will fall into the realm of contrivance and be instantly dismissible.  They usually illustrate a randomness to life and hope to illuminate how people affect one another, even if unwittingly.  And due to the nature of the plotting, they must boast an ensemble of main characters to partake in these interactions.""Heights"" is an effective glimpse into the lives of a handful of New Yorkers centering largely on the artistic community.  The cast is headed by Glenn Close (we miss you in mainstream movies!) in a strong and sexy performance as an acting legend.  It's a great, showy role for one of our finest talents.  Other significant roles are handled ably by Elizabeth Banks, James Marsden, Jesse Bradford and John Light.  This is an appealing and talented cast--and you'll want to stick with them, even if the film veers toward melodrama on occasion.The relationships presented are believable and well thought out--and since this is primarily a relationship drama, that's a real asset.  The situations are always intriguing, the dialogue crisp and literate.  The revelations and drama increase as the film progresses--a little too conveniently, in fact, for such a short time frame.  But each actor gets his/her opportunity to shine--and it's worth seeing for the performances alone.You've probably seen similarly plotted films, but ""Heights"" works.  There's a lot of coincidence involved in the plotting, as there often is in films of this type--but I don't think you'll mind too much.  The film is smart enough and the actors engaging enough to overlook a few shortcomings--and there is much to appreciate if you give it a chance.

935855,A342EHO42V2G38,B000B5IOX4,"Terran ""Terran""","[6, 12]","I have to give a dissenting opinion, mainly because the character of Isabel, and every aspect of her life, was given too much attention.  I found myself annoyed as screen time was therefore taken away from other characters, more proactive personalities, especially the male characters in the film, whose own stories are basically untold, and are left to the audience to fill in the gaps.  Not just the unfaithful husband of the stage and screen darling, either.  The mysterious photographer - who has had a major impact in the lives of many of the characters in the film - is never portrayed in the film, a typical photographer evidently never in front of the camera himself, but only behind it.  But this is a tired worn out cliche - of hearing about him, but never seeing him.  His ex-lovers seem to have a low opinion of him after-the-fact, but he's a genius portrait photographer, we're told, and one who beds each of his models.  On the other hand, judging by his nickname for one ex-lover - ""heartbreaker"" - one has the sense the photographer at least had been the one to get dumped, at least once.  It's a worn out cliche, the absent main character, done to death with TV series like Frasier (the never-seen Maris).  The only other explanation (besides Isabel) for why more time isn't devoted to the three male characters on-screen is because the filmmaker is trying to make a mystery out of the story, so all the endings aren't realized by the audience in advance, but this makes for dissatisfaction in the viewer.  We really want to know these people.  As for the actors, all the performances were good, and Glenn Close especially excellent - as always.  However, a certain physical sameness in the three male leads, had me sometimes not knowing who I was looking at until they opened their mouths (Alec & the Englishman).  (Two other male characters make such a slight impression, I forgot about them as soon as they were off-screen.)  And Glenn Close and Elizabeth Banks seemed to swap hair colors for the film: I think Banks' character of Isabel is meant to represent blonde for purity and innocence.  So overall, a very involving story with wonderful acting, but a few problems in execution and editing prevented it from being one of the best films.  It's definitely worth re-watching, especially as once all the pieces come together at the end you can better appreciate the individual performances.",4,don't short-change the men,1131148800,"11 5, 2005",2005,2412,"['have', 'give', 'dissenting', 'opinion', 'mainly', 'character', 'Isabel', 'aspect', 'life', 'was', 'given', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'found', 'annoyed', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'therefore', 'taken', 'away', 'other', 'characters', 'more', 'proactive', 'personalities', 'especially', 'male', 'characters', 'film', 'own', 'stories', 'are', 'basically', 'untold', 'are', 'left', 'audience', 'fill', 'gaps', 'Not', 'just', 'unfaithful', 'husband', 'stage', 'screen', 'darling', 'either', 'mysterious', 'photographer', 'who', 'had', 'major', 'impact', 'lives', 'many', 'characters', 'film', 'never', 'portrayed', 'film', 'typical', 'photographer', 'evidently', 'never', 'front', 'camera', 'only', 'tired', 'worn', 'cliche', 'hearing', 'never', 'seeing', 'ex-lovers', 'seem', 'have', 'low', 'opinion', 'after-the-fact', 'genius', 'portrait', 'photographer', ""'re"", 'told', 'one', 'who', 'models', 'other', 'hand', 'judging', 'nickname', 'one', 'ex-lover', 'heartbreaker', 'one', 'sense', 'photographer', 'least', 'had', 'been', 'one', 'get', 'dumped', 'least', 'once', 'worn', 'out', 'cliche', 'absent', 'main', 'character', 'done', 'death', 'TV', 'series', 'Frasier', 'never-seen', 'Maris', 'only', 'other', 'explanation', 'Isabel', 'why', 'more', 'time', ""n't"", 'devoted', 'three', 'male', 'characters', 'on-screen', 'filmmaker', 'trying', 'make', 'mystery', 'story', 'endings', 'are', ""n't"", 'realized', 'audience', 'advance', 'dissatisfaction', 'viewer', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'people', 'actors', 'performances', 'were', 'good', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'especially', 'excellent', 'always', 'However', 'certain', 'physical', 'sameness', 'three', 'male', 'leads', 'had', 'sometimes', 'not', 'knowing', 'who', 'was', 'looking', 'opened', 'mouths', 'Alec', 'Englishman', 'Two', 'other', 'male', 'characters', 'make', 'slight', 'impression', 'forgot', 'about', 'as', 'soon', 'were', 'off-screen', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'seemed', 'swap', 'hair', 'colors', 'film', 'think', 'Banks', 'character', 'Isabel', 'meant', 'represent', 'blonde', 'purity', 'innocence', 'So', 'overall', 'very', 'involving', 'story', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'few', 'problems', 'execution', 'editing', 'prevented', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'definitely', 'worth', 're-watching', 'especially', 'once', 'pieces', 'come', 'together', 'end', 'can', 'better', 'appreciate', 'individual', 'performances']",Heights

935857,A2817E4ZO8LJ0M,B000B5IOX4,Tom Chatt,"[25, 27]","Chris Terrio's Heights (adapted by Amy Fox from her stage play) tells an intriguing story of various people in Manhattan whose lives and relationships intersect in unexpected ways. The opening scene is a Julliard acting master class, with star actress Diana Lee (played by Glenn Close) interrupting two students needing improvement on their MacBeth scene, and giving an impassioned speech about how passion is missing from their performance, and from everybody's lives these days. ""We put up bold fronts and a gracious face in response to seeing our husbands with other women, and then when no one is looking we cry into our soy latte,"" she bemoans. This set piece is of course the leitmotif for the film, as the teacher can act great Shakespeare but can't bring the advice to bear on her own life. We soon meet Diana's daughter, Isabel, a photographer, and her fiance Jonathan, a handsome Jewish professional, as well as Alec, an actor wanting to break out of the Fringe Festival, and Peter, the latest lover of the famous photographer Benjamin Stone, who has been given a tortuously cruel assignment by Vanity Fair. These characters are all going through the motions of their lives, strong gritty New Yorkers on the surface, but without passion, without really knowing themselves or those they love, and all with something eating them out from the inside. As their paths cross and their lives unravel all in one evening, it is like watching a windshield crack. One crack leads to the next, and the jagged patterns formed can fragment the light to a beautiful effect, but you can never look through the windshield the same way as before.This film explores some of the same themes as Sideways. In Sideways, we had an actor and a poseur-writer representing the superficiality of Los Angeles culture. In Heights, we have an actress and a photographer symbolizing the contrast between appearances (or performances) and ""real life"" in New York City artsy circles. (The metaphor is artfully deployed, both in Glenn Close's master class scene, and later in a scene with Elizabeth Banks photographing a mother and daughter on the subway. The latter called to mind a line from Rent, ""Hey artist, get your own life!"", as well as other echoes from that play in which the filmmaker cannot see and the songwriter cannot hear.) The difference between Heights and Sideways is that in Heights, the characters have inner lives that we eventually get glimpses into, and can develop some sympathy for. These people are more real. Like Sideways, the setting in Heights is an essential part of the texture of the film. While the Santa Ynez wine country scenery in Sideways added a camp note to the underlying cynicism, the rooftop, skyline, and street scenes of Manhattan enhance the sense of disconnectedness-despite-proximity in Heights. Often, we only started to get inside the characters when they stepped outside onto the roof. The use of cell phones added a subtle ironic underscore to the same theme, especially between the engaged couple who carried ""direct-connect"" phones, but with their emotional connections falling short of their technological ones. Ultimately, both Sideways and Heights end on a note of hope, but the hope at the end of Heights seems more genuinely promising, because the characters are more real.The performances in the film were are top-notch, starting with Glenn Close brilliant as the diva who can express Shakespeare better than herself, with a strong exterior but vulnerable inside. Elizabeth Banks is flawless as Isabel, strong but lost and later shattered, and James Marsden is wonderful as Jonathan, who thinks he knows what he wants and has it, while Jesse Bradford is great as Alec, who knows what he wants but not how to get it. A number of good performances in other parts pull together a strong ensemble, beautifully woven together in Amy Fox's story and Chris Terrio's direction. It is beautifully filmed, and there are a number of great shots where looks and expressions convey volumes without words.",4,"Like Sideways, but more real and more sympathetic",1126569600,"09 13, 2005",2005,4027,"['Chris', 'Terrio', 'Heights', 'adapted', 'Amy', 'Fox', 'stage', 'play', 'intriguing', 'story', 'various', 'people', 'Manhattan', 'lives', 'relationships', 'intersect', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'opening', 'scene', 'Julliard', 'acting', 'master', 'class', 'star', 'actress', 'Diana', 'Lee', 'played', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'interrupting', 'two', 'students', 'needing', 'improvement', 'MacBeth', 'scene', 'giving', 'impassioned', 'speech', 'how', 'passion', 'missing', 'performance', 'everybody', 'lives', 'days', 'put', 'up', 'bold', 'fronts', 'gracious', 'face', 'response', 'seeing', 'husbands', 'other', 'women', 'then', 'when', 'one', 'looking', 'cry', 'soy', 'latte', 'set', 'piece', 'course', 'leitmotif', 'film', 'teacher', 'can', 'act', 'great', 'Shakespeare', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'advice', 'bear', 'own', 'life', 'soon', 'meet', 'Diana', 'daughter', 'Isabel', 'photographer', 'fiance', 'Jonathan', 'handsome', 'Jewish', 'professional', 'as', 'well', 'Alec', 'actor', 'wanting', 'break', 'Fringe', 'Festival', 'Peter', 'latest', 'lover', 'famous', 'photographer', 'Benjamin', 'Stone', 'who', 'been', 'given', 'tortuously', 'cruel', 'assignment', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'characters', 'are', 'going', 'motions', 'lives', 'strong', 'gritty', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'surface', 'passion', 'really', 'knowing', 'love', 'something', 'eating', 'out', 'inside', 'paths', 'cross', 'lives', 'unravel', 'one', 'evening', 'watching', 'windshield', 'crack', 'One', 'crack', 'next', 'jagged', 'patterns', 'formed', 'can', 'fragment', 'light', 'beautiful', 'effect', 'can', 'never', 'look', 'windshield', 'same', 'way', 'before.This', 'film', 'same', 'themes', 'Sideways', 'Sideways', 'had', 'actor', 'poseur-writer', 'representing', 'superficiality', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'culture', 'Heights', 'have', 'actress', 'photographer', 'symbolizing', 'contrast', 'appearances', 'performances', 'real', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'artsy', 'circles', 'metaphor', 'artfully', 'deployed', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'master', 'class', 'scene', 'later', 'scene', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'photographing', 'mother', 'daughter', 'subway', 'latter', 'called', 'mind', 'line', 'Rent', 'Hey', 'artist', 'get', 'own', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'echoes', 'play', 'filmmaker', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'songwriter', 'can', 'not', 'hear', 'difference', 'Heights', 'Sideways', 'Heights', 'characters', 'have', 'inner', 'lives', 'eventually', 'get', 'glimpses', 'can', 'develop', 'sympathy', 'people', 'are', 'more', 'real', 'Sideways', 'setting', 'Heights', 'essential', 'part', 'texture', 'film', 'Santa', 'Ynez', 'wine', 'country', 'scenery', 'Sideways', 'added', 'camp', 'note', 'underlying', 'cynicism', 'rooftop', 'skyline', 'street', 'scenes', 'Manhattan', 'enhance', 'sense', 'disconnectedness-despite-proximity', 'Heights', 'Often', 'only', 'started', 'get', 'characters', 'when', 'stepped', 'roof', 'use', 'cell', 'phones', 'added', 'subtle', 'ironic', 'underscore', 'same', 'theme', 'especially', 'engaged', 'couple', 'who', 'carried', 'direct-connect', 'phones', 'emotional', 'connections', 'falling', 'short', 'technological', 'ones', 'Ultimately', 'Sideways', 'Heights', 'end', 'note', 'hope', 'hope', 'end', 'Heights', 'more', 'genuinely', 'promising', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'real.The', 'performances', 'film', 'were', 'are', 'top-notch', 'starting', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'brilliant', 'diva', 'who', 'can', 'express', 'Shakespeare', 'better', 'strong', 'exterior', 'vulnerable', 'inside', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'flawless', 'Isabel', 'strong', 'lost', 'later', 'shattered', 'James', 'Marsden', 'wonderful', 'Jonathan', 'who', 'what', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'great', 'Alec', 'who', 'what', 'not', 'how', 'get', 'number', 'good', 'performances', 'other', 'parts', 'pull', 'together', 'strong', 'ensemble', 'beautifully', 'woven', 'together', 'Amy', 'Fox', 'story', 'Chris', 'Terrio', 'direction', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'are', 'number', 'great', 'shots', 'where', 'looks', 'expressions', 'convey', 'volumes', 'words']",Heights
935858,A2KU5PG32H7QBN,B000B5IOX4,"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic""","[16, 20]","What's considered common knowledge is the opinion that Glenn Close, as theater goddess Diana Lee, is Oscar-worthy while the rest of ""Heights"" is simply mediocre. I'm here to present the case as to why this is not true. You see, ""Heights"" unexpectadly touched me. Aesthetically, it presents a unique image of New York with pale blues, greens, and greys merging into a blurred, sometimes beautiful landscape; it symbolizes all that is there and all there needs to be. It is as if director Chris Terrio wants New York City to be a series of mirrors, reflecting and refracting the conflicted characters who in the film ultimately decide whether or not their lives are being lead correctly or with purpose: with what they believe to be love. Luckily, this is an effective method and, with subtlety, you feel the characters' emotions being reaffirmed.Leading this ensemble of unsure New Yorkers is the young actress Elizabeth Banks, who has improved considerably since her supporting turn in 2003's ""Seabiscuit."" She plays Isabel Lee, a photographer overshadowed by the fame of her mother Diana. Her fiancee, Jonathan (James Marsden), is a successful man with a secret, which ends up being what you may not expect it to be (though some claim they knew far before the film ended, the film is not about plot twists but what happens to the characters and how they each deal with their decisions, providing for a more lasting effect). The rest of the cast includes Alec (Jesse Bradford), a minor actor who meets Diana through an audition, and the unseen Benjamin, a renowned photographer who is a major player in the film despite not having a physical presence on screen. In fact, that Benjamin is not seen is one of the most effective techniques in the film. That he is not embodied physically allows for self-interpretation, which enhances the situations in which Benjamin is involved given their emotional complexity (it's a shame I can't elaborate further, but trust me when I say the conflicts with Benjamin are successfully involving, complements of the fantastic screenwriter Amy Fox).As a film its greatest strength is Glenn Close, who does turn out the best performance in the film, and she also resonates as probably the best performance in her category of the worthy actresses I've seen so far this year (which excludes Joan Allen, though I will be seeing ""Yes"" and ""The Upside of Anger"" quite soon). Close, being the great actress that she is, handles Diana's myriad dimensions incredibly well; she is at once confident and conflicted, amused at life and suffering underneath its emotional weight. The film's greatest weakness is its inevitable tendency to come off as slight, useless, recycled, etc. However, the perspective it brings to its message is made interesting through the intensely observent DP work reflective of Isabel's chosen vocation, which she further explores during the film till a devastating line crushes her willingness to bloom artistically. But consider that this message may not simply be ""live your life how you want and don't live for others, or you'll never be happy,"" which was already studied in 2002's ""The Hours."" Instead, I believe the message to be that happiness cannot be achieved by gaining or by manipulating what is outside of ourselves; that happiness is ultimately a lifestyle, a point of view, a decision, not a forever distant goal. As the film ends, the theme unfolds into a sense of hope; that hope has shown itself as a uniting theme in '05 cinema is a strong sign that what we as a people desire is the potential for change, even a better future. As the characters in ""Heights"" demonstrate, we decide our happiness. That right there is where this film's punch exists: in its case for hope, which transcends the film and thus gives it purpose as art.",4,"Subtle and gorgeously shot, with a great performance from Glenn Close",1125273600,"08 29, 2005",2005,3798,"['What', 'considered', 'common', 'knowledge', 'opinion', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'theater', 'goddess', 'Diana', 'Lee', 'Oscar-worthy', 'rest', 'Heights', 'simply', 'mediocre', ""'m"", 'here', 'present', 'case', 'why', 'not', 'true', 'see', 'Heights', 'unexpectadly', 'touched', 'Aesthetically', 'unique', 'image', 'New', 'York', 'pale', 'blues', 'greens', 'greys', 'merging', 'blurred', 'sometimes', 'beautiful', 'landscape', 'there', 'there', 'be', 'director', 'Chris', 'Terrio', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'be', 'series', 'mirrors', 'reflecting', 'refracting', 'conflicted', 'characters', 'who', 'film', 'ultimately', 'decide', 'not', 'lives', 'are', 'being', 'lead', 'correctly', 'purpose', 'what', 'believe', 'be', 'love', 'Luckily', 'effective', 'method', 'subtlety', 'feel', 'characters', 'emotions', 'being', 'reaffirmed.Leading', 'ensemble', 'unsure', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'young', 'actress', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'who', 'improved', 'considerably', 'supporting', 'turn', '2003', 'Seabiscuit', 'Isabel', 'Lee', 'photographer', 'overshadowed', 'fame', 'mother', 'Diana', 'fiancee', 'Jonathan', 'James', 'Marsden', 'successful', 'man', 'secret', 'up', 'being', 'what', 'may', 'not', 'expect', 'be', 'claim', 'knew', 'far', 'film', 'ended', 'film', 'not', 'plot', 'twists', 'what', 'characters', 'how', 'deal', 'decisions', 'providing', 'more', 'lasting', 'effect', 'rest', 'cast', 'Alec', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'minor', 'actor', 'who', 'Diana', 'audition', 'unseen', 'Benjamin', 'renowned', 'photographer', 'who', 'major', 'player', 'film', 'not', 'having', 'physical', 'presence', 'screen', 'fact', 'Benjamin', 'not', 'seen', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'techniques', 'film', 'not', 'embodied', 'physically', 'self-interpretation', 'situations', 'Benjamin', 'involved', 'given', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'shame', 'ca', ""n't"", 'elaborate', 'further', 'trust', 'when', 'say', 'conflicts', 'Benjamin', 'are', 'successfully', 'involving', 'complements', 'fantastic', 'screenwriter', 'Amy', 'Fox', 'film', 'greatest', 'strength', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'who', 'turn', 'out', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'also', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'category', 'worthy', 'actresses', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'Yes', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'quite', 'soon', 'Close', 'being', 'great', 'actress', 'Diana', 'myriad', 'dimensions', 'incredibly', 'well', 'once', 'confident', 'conflicted', 'amused', 'life', 'suffering', 'underneath', 'emotional', 'weight', 'film', 'greatest', 'weakness', 'inevitable', 'tendency', 'come', 'off', 'slight', 'useless', 'recycled', 'etc', 'However', 'perspective', 'message', 'made', 'interesting', 'intensely', 'observent', 'DP', 'work', 'reflective', 'Isabel', 'chosen', 'vocation', 'further', 'explores', 'film', 'till', 'devastating', 'line', 'willingness', 'bloom', 'artistically', 'consider', 'message', 'may', 'not', 'simply', 'be', 'live', 'life', 'how', 'want', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'others', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'happy', 'was', 'already', 'studied', '2002', 'Hours', 'Instead', 'believe', 'message', 'be', 'happiness', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'achieved', 'gaining', 'manipulating', 'what', 'outside', 'ourselves', 'happiness', 'ultimately', 'lifestyle', 'point', 'view', 'decision', 'not', 'forever', 'distant', 'goal', 'film', 'theme', 'sense', 'hope', 'hope', 'shown', 'uniting', 'theme', ""'05"", 'cinema', 'strong', 'sign', 'what', 'people', 'desire', 'potential', 'change', 'even', 'better', 'future', 'characters', 'Heights', 'demonstrate', 'decide', 'happiness', 'right', 'where', 'film', 'punch', 'exists', 'case', 'hope', 'film', 'thus', 'purpose', 'art']",Heights
