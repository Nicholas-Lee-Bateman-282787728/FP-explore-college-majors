They and Gaither speak about the love Payne had for his family.  Glen Payne was born Oct. 20, 1926 and died Oct. 15, 1999.One thing a viewer can get from the Cathedrals performances is the bond the two had, George and Glen having fun, joking, and especially the enjoyment they had when singing.  Gaither speaks about the ""frick and frack""  act that he said was genuine joy.  Many members of the Cathedrals have changed, but these two have been together for 30 years.The musical numbers include:  This Old House/Saints Go Marching On;  Tryin' To Get a Glimpse;  Life Will Be Sweeter; Climbing Higher and Higher;  Old Convention Song;  Boundless Love;  Roll Away Troubled River; Give the World a Smile;  My Lord Will Send a Moses;  A New Born Feeling;  Haven of Rest;  A Prodigal Son;  Laughing Sog; Heavenly Parade; Movin' Up to Gloryland;  Mexico;  Beyond Sunset;  O What A Savior; Cleanse Me;  Thanks to Calvary;  New Life/Everybody Will Be Happy.There is a lot of music here, and plenty of stories.
