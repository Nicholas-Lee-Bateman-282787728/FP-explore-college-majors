1040091,A3TJJHMWV3SFNI,B000LPS47K,"Brett Heitkam ""DVD obsessed""","[5, 8]","Pro-Life is a horror movie about a girl who is raped by the devil and wants an abortion.  The catch is, she has an uber-right-wing Christian pro-life father who, once he finds out his daughter is in the abortion clinic, does anything and everything to get her out.  This movie deals with a very touchy subject.  It definitely has a pro-choice slant, as it portrays the father character as a completely psychotic idiot who shoots and kills anyone in his way throughout the entire film.Pro-Life is not for everyone.  Real-life pro-life supporters will be outraged, while only a small number of pro-choicers will be too disgusted by the subject matter to enjoy this story.  That being said, I enjoyed it, but I can totally see other peoples' points of view and how they may feel about the subject matter.  I have to say, though, that compared to some of the other Masters of Horror series, this one IS one of the best as far as story, effects, gore, and direction are concerned.The movie is presented in anamorphic widescreen 1.78:1 and looks great.  As with all the MOH series, there are tons of extras on this disc that make it a great buy for a small price.If this sounds like a movie that you will not be offended by, go ahead and buy it! I liked it a lot.  If you think the subject matter may be too much for you...steer clear.  That's all I can say!",5,"One of the best Masters of Horrors.

I have read reviews on various message boards objecting to ""Masters of Horror"" episodes with a political point of view (esp. Joe Dante's ""Honecoming""). What is art if not an expression of the artist's viewpoint?

It is Angelique, who demands the abortion, who actually carries out God's will. Her father and brainwashed brothers take innocent lives in quite gory and shocking scenes.

1040094,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B000LPS47K,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[0, 1]","Contains SpoilersA young girl, Angelique (Caitlin Wachs), who claims to be impregnated by something other worldly, is taken to a nearby abortion clinic. The girl's religious father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman) who has a history with the clinic and is ordered to keep away, is in hot pursuit and is convinced he has strict orders from God to make sure the birth is not aborted. Armed and with the help of his brainwashed sons, Dwayne, breaks in, with the intent of killing anyone who gets in the way of his divine mission.I was pleasantly surprised by this episode. Although it is inferior to Carpenter's entry of season 1 ""Cigarette Burns"", this installment has a few unexpected surprises. Many seem to have a problem with this film's message and/or theme. I on the other hand do not care if it is meant as a commentary or not. As long as it delivers as a horror film and keeps me entertained then all is good. Unlike Season 1's ""Homecoming"" which had a lot to say but failed miserably as a horror movie, this one delivered on most parts.One of my biggest complaints lies with the gore effects. I am not a fan of CGI in horror films but I can forgive it when it's well done and used in a fantasy element but I absolutely loathe CGI gore effects. No matter how hard it tries, it does not look real and you never get the same effect had it been done old school. Some of the gore in this episode was clearly CGI and therefore the impact was immediately lost. My other complaint was with the birthing scene. There was a build-up to that birthing scene and although I would have preferred the baby not be shown at all (more on this a little later), Carpenter could have delivered a more effective, more fantastic mutant newborn, one that would at least shock and repel. What we got looked like something right out of Carpenter's ""The Thing"" and nowhere near as fantastic. When finally revealed, the evil spawn was a plastic looking cockroach with a glued on baby doll head and was as frightening and as threatening as my niece's crippled miniature Lhasa Apso. In this case, I would have preferred Carpenter went the ""Rosemary's Baby"" route and not show the baby at all. The baby's daddy on the other hand was brilliantly ferocious and made a heck of an entrance. Despite one great looking demon, this is where I was torn. The film starts of as a thriller, all is implied but nothing fantastical is shown, and the mass shootings despite the CGI gore, is frightfully real, then, the Devil decides he wants to visit its newborn. I was surprised it didn't show up with a bottle of champagne and cigars. I would have preferred they kept the tone as it was originally set. There was no need to turn it into a cheesy Sci-Fi-Fantasy with creatures galore. Depite this little set back, this horror tale did keep me disturbed if only for a moment and there is one torture scene that is truly unpleasant. As far as the performances go, Ron Perlman is noteworthy. He played the part of a religious fanatic who thinks he's doing Gods will very convincingly and his menacing physique was effective. The rest of the cast is not as memorable.Overall, this episode delivers as a horror film. When compared to Carpenter's earlier, far superior entry ""Cigarette Burns"" you would never guess it was the same director but you can say the same thing if you compare his ""Halloween"" to ""Prince of Darkness"". If you don't expect much, this may please and as an hour long time waster, there is a lot going on here to keep you interested.",3,Pro-Life Has its Merits.,1258243200,"11 15, 2009",2009,3499,"['Contains', 'SpoilersA', 'young', 'girl', 'Angelique', 'Caitlin', 'Wachs', 'who', 'be', 'impregnated', 'something', 'other', 'worldly', 'taken', 'nearby', 'abortion', 'clinic', 'girl', 'religious', 'father', 'Dwayne', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'who', 'history', 'clinic', 'ordered', 'keep', 'away', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'convinced', 'strict', 'orders', 'God', 'make', 'sure', 'birth', 'not', 'aborted', 'Armed', 'help', 'brainwashed', 'sons', 'Dwayne', 'breaks', 'intent', 'killing', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'divine', 'mission.I', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'episode', 'inferior', 'Carpenter', 'entry', 'season', '1', 'Cigarette', 'Burns', 'installment', 'few', 'unexpected', 'surprises', 'Many', 'seem', 'have', 'problem', 'film', 'message', 'and/or', 'theme', 'other', 'hand', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'meant', 'commentary', 'not', 'As', 'long', 'horror', 'film', 'keeps', 'entertained', 'then', 'good', 'Season', '1', 'Homecoming', 'had', 'lot', 'say', 'failed', 'miserably', 'horror', 'movie', 'one', 'delivered', 'most', 'parts.One', 'biggest', 'complaints', 'gore', 'effects', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'CGI', 'horror', 'films', 'can', 'forgive', 'when', 'well', 'done', 'used', 'fantasy', 'element', 'absolutely', 'loathe', 'CGI', 'gore', 'effects', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'not', 'look', 'real', 'never', 'get', 'same', 'effect', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'old', 'school', 'gore', 'episode', 'was', 'clearly', 'CGI', 'therefore', 'impact', 'was', 'immediately', 'lost', 'other', 'complaint', 'was', 'birthing', 'scene', 'was', 'build-up', 'birthing', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'baby', 'not', 'be', 'shown', 'more', 'little', 'later', 'Carpenter', 'could', 'have', 'delivered', 'more', 'effective', 'more', 'fantastic', 'mutant', 'newborn', 'one', 'would', 'least', 'shock', 'repel', 'What', 'got', 'looked', 'something', 'right', 'Carpenter', 'Thing', 'nowhere', 'fantastic', 'When', 'finally', 'revealed', 'evil', 'spawn', 'was', 'plastic', 'looking', 'cockroach', 'glued', 'baby', 'doll', 'head', 'was', 'frightening', 'as', 'threatening', 'niece', 'crippled', 'miniature', 'Lhasa', 'Apso', 'case', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'Carpenter', 'went', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'route', 'not', 'show', 'baby', 'baby', 'daddy', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'ferocious', 'made', 'heck', 'entrance', 'one', 'great', 'looking', 'demon', 'where', 'was', 'torn', 'film', 'thriller', 'implied', 'nothing', 'fantastical', 'shown', 'mass', 'CGI', 'gore', 'frightfully', 'real', 'then', 'Devil', 'visit', 'newborn', 'was', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'bottle', 'champagne', 'cigars', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'kept', 'tone', 'was', 'originally', 'set', 'was', 'need', 'turn', 'cheesy', 'Sci-Fi-Fantasy', 'creatures', 'galore', 'Depite', 'little', 'set', 'back', 'horror', 'tale', 'did', 'keep', 'disturbed', 'only', 'moment', 'one', 'torture', 'scene', 'truly', 'unpleasant', 'As', 'far', 'performances', 'go', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'noteworthy', 'played', 'part', 'religious', 'fanatic', 'who', 'doing', 'Gods', 'will', 'very', 'convincingly', 'menacing', 'physique', 'was', 'effective', 'rest', 'cast', 'not', 'memorable.Overall', 'episode', 'horror', 'film', 'When', 'compared', 'Carpenter', 'earlier', 'far', 'superior', 'entry', 'Cigarette', 'Burns', 'would', 'never', 'guess', 'was', 'same', 'director', 'can', 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'compare', 'Halloween', 'Prince', 'Darkness', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'may', 'please', 'hour', 'long', 'time', 'waster', 'lot', 'going', 'here', 'keep', 'interested']",Masters of Horror: Pro-Life

1040100,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000LPS47K,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[17, 24]","John Carpenter returns to Showtime's ""Masters of Horror"" series with Season 2's offering ""Pro-Life.""  As with most anthology series, the quality of any given episode and the reaction to it can be widely divergent.  Carpenter's entry from last season, ""Cigarette Burns,"" is one of its most divisive.  It is regarded in some circles as the best the show had to offer and dismissed out of hand by others.  I fell somewhere in between the debate ranking it in the middle/upper part of the pack.Intriguingly enough, the Takeshi Miike episode banned from Season 1 involved a storyline revolving around abortions.  ""Pro-Life,"" as you might guess from the title, also has this as a major theme.  But don't worry, this is no heavy handed diatribe--it's light and loose but still has some sting to its barbs.  This is a brand of horror that I like to think of as ""everything but the kitchen sink.""  It is a social satire and a commentary on pro-life extremists--but it also throws in a grisly birth, a massive gun fight, torture, a insectile creature with a baby head, a chasm to an alternate world, and what appears to be the devil himself.  In other words, I pretty much loved it!  Easily one of the more entertaining episodes, no one will confuse this with great art--but it's a whole lot of fun.The action gets going when a doctor from a local abortion clinic almost runs down a young girl fleeing from an unknown pursuer.  Taking her into the hospital to make sure she's all right, she confesses to being pregnant.  She thinks God has brought her here to get an abortion.  Her father ends up at the front gate demanding her return, he is a pro-life activist who has had previous run-ins with this establishment.  What follows include a revelation about the unnatural origins of the fetus, a supernaturally fast pregnancy cycle, and a battle for the father to save his unborn grandchild.There is lots of humor in ""Pro-Life,"" plenty of gore, and some crazy creatures.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[0, 0]","Legendary horror maestro John Carpenter returns to Masters of Horror, and re-unites with his Cigarette Burns writers Drew McWeeny and Scott Swan for Pro-Life.  The story involves the teen daughter (Caitlin Wachs) of an anti-abortion activist (Ron ""Hellboy"" Perlman) who seeks refuge at a secluded abortion clinic, claiming the baby she's carrying is that of the devil himself.  As her father and his three sons attack the clinic guns blazing, two doctors (Mark Feurstein and Emmanuelle Vaugier) are caught in the middle, and soon come to realize that the girl's pregnancy is not of this world.  What could have been a rousing, satiric play on religious fanatiscism instead becomes an almost schlocky shock fest, and by the time of the ""birthing"" scene, Pro-Life gets to the point of being more funny than anything else.  That being said, Pro-Life is still a decent Masters of Horror episode that doesn't live up to its potential, particularly the lame closing scene.  Flaws aside though, KNB once again offer up some great makeup effects work, Carpenter manages to weave some very creepy scenes (such as the revenge on the doctor), and Ron Perlman and the rest of the cast are actually pretty good.

The first thing that pops into ones mind when the credits role is a lame phrase for a bad film: "" Oh, where art thou talent gone, Mr. Carpenter."" In Pro-Life this master is about half-way to his glory days for about forty-five minutes, or so. It might be an imperfect first two-thirds, but its still the best stuff he has done in a while. Yet, then it seems like he just went and ran out of money, because the editing becomes so irritating due to its choppiness, that this awkwardness seems like Carpenter just tries to get the film over and forgets something called ""buildup:"" as the flow in this last block just does not seem clean, despite the film starting out good enough with a pissed off Ron Pearlman of Hellboy fame getting in shootouts with the doctor of the clinic. This is a good action scene, if done somewhat pedestrian, but its still all in fun, not to be taken seriously. While shades of  Carpenter`s latter-day, ""Assault on Precinct 13"" come to mind in the good way, and there's some great `n gross f/x scenes. Yet, the dialogue in the entire film is pretty awful, and the script does not seem to make many good statements on this controversial subject, besides being the backdrop of the story. Yet, this is not where it fails, it falters in the  concluding scenes in which the demon is featured, and this aspect to the story is simply not needed in a plot that should have just concentrated on human horror, and took its time, without rushing to the end credits.* 1/2 (Out of 5)",1,"Carp almost gets it back, yet loses it again",1174521600,"03 22, 2007",2007,1711,"['Pro-Life', 'near', 'hour-film', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'series', 'Showtime', 'siege', 'three', 'anti-abortionist', 'boys', 'father', 'abortion', 'clinic', 'rescue', 'sister', 'who', 'impregnated', 'demon', 'first', 'thing', 'ones', 'mind', 'when', 'credits', 'role', 'lame', 'phrase', 'bad', 'film', 'Oh', 'where', 'art', 'thou', 'talent', 'gone', 'Mr', 'Carpenter', 'Pro-Life', 'master', 'half-way', 'glory', 'days', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'so', 'might', 'be', 'imperfect', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'still', 'best', 'stuff', 'done', 'while', 'then', 'just', 'went', 'ran', 'money', 'editing', 'so', 'irritating', 'due', 'choppiness', 'awkwardness', 'Carpenter', 'just', 'get', 'film', 'forgets', 'something', 'called', 'buildup', 'flow', 'last', 'block', 'just', 'not', 'seem', 'clean', 'film', 'starting', 'out', 'good', 'enough', 'pissed', 'off', 'Ron', 'Pearlman', 'Hellboy', 'fame', 'getting', 'shootouts', 'doctor', 'clinic', 'good', 'action', 'scene', 'done', 'somewhat', 'pedestrian', 'still', 'fun', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'shades', 'Carpenter', 's', 'latter-day', 'Assault', 'Precinct', '13', 'come', 'mind', 'good', 'way', 'great', 'n', 'gross', 'f/x', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'entire', 'film', 'pretty', 'awful', 'script', 'not', 'seem', 'make', 'many', 'good', 'statements', 'controversial', 'subject', 'being', 'backdrop', 'story', 'not', 'where', 'concluding', 'scenes', 'demon', 'featured', 'aspect', 'story', 'simply', 'not', 'needed', 'plot', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'concentrated', 'human', 'horror', 'took', 'time', 'rushing', 'end', 'credits', '1/2', 'Out', '5']",Masters of Horror: Pro-Life

1040104,A11EQ2TAGTPQDB,B000LPS47K,Paul Schifferli,"[2, 4]","""Pro-Life"" of the Masters of Horror series... Oh dear, how much can be said about this one.  The story focuses on a teenage girl being taken to an abortion clinic, demanding she have her baby aborted. Why is she in such a hurry, you ask? Well, because the father of her baby is a demon, or perhaps Satan. It's never stated if the father is the Devil or just a demon, but you get to see the ""father"", so you be the judge. Anyway, the main obstacle for this girl is that HER father (played excellently by Ron Perlman) is pro-life, and a very serious christian. Well, the demon speaks to the father, telling him to ""protect the baby"", which he assumes is God telling him. So, he and his three sons break into the abortion clinic and start shooting everything that moves, which is apparently what God would want. The climax of the episode is the the Demon/Satan emerging from Hell into the abortion clinic to retrieve his son. I reccomend this for Carpenter fans, and fans of Ron Perlman. I don't reccomend this for anyone who leans strongly toward pro choice OR anti abortion, because well, this film won't change your mind, and will probably just offend you.

One morning while running in the woods she is nearly hit by a car whose two occupants happen to be on their way to work at the local women's clinic. They take her in to see if she is okay from the accident and then find out that she is with child. Soon the clinic is invaded by her father a God fearing, gun loving, and abortion hating madman played by Ron Perlman. He is not the only problem as they soon find out that the child's father may in fact be the devil himself. The staff and other patients at the hospital are caught in the middle of a deadly war between the two dads. The violence and special effects in this movie are very gross and very graphic. The spider baby is especially gross to look at and when the devil finally appears his scaly body and horns are a bit much. Either way this film sucks it doesn't look or have any of the fun you expect from a Carpenter film. To say that Ron Perlman gives the best performance isn't saying much as the actress playing his daughter is terrible and the doctors barely keep a straight face saying their lines. Carpenter says in the making of that he considers the Perlman character a hero I certainly would not go that far. He tries to legitimize this film by telling the tale of a deeply religious man who has brainwashed his kids into blindly following him on a mission to save his daughter their sister by killing innocent people and then at the end after so many people have lost their lives raising the question if it was as God had wished it or if he had been listening to the wrong God.

Of course she tries anyways because she knows the truth about it so her crazy father chases her to the clinic, which by the way is like a small fortress. So she gets in an her father becomes angry and from there insues gun battles, demon babies, torture and the one thing I didn't like, the ending.If you must know about it, the girl has the baby which is like a spider/baby, the demon which impregnated her shows up and just when you think things are gonna get better it doesn't. You see the demon baby gets killed but yet the demon does nothing about it and walks off like a sad kid who lost it's dog. Maybe they ran out of time and that's the best they could do being that there only hour long episodes but damn, you could've done better than that.
