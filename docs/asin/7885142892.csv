And what it shame it is, because it deserved a theatrical release in the good ole USA. As far as I know - and I may be wrong - it didn't happen, and lovers of great movies missed out on an overpowering one. ""Dragon"" delivers in every sense possible, cinematically speaking. It is one intelligent detective drama, with amazing martial arts infused in it.The film star is the one and only Donnie Yen - my favorite martial arts actor these days - as Liu Jin-Xi, a worker at a paper mill on small and picturesque town in Yunnan, ""at the southwestern edge of China."" It is 1917 and we find him at the beginning of the movie, just waking up and getting ready to go to work, having some quality time with Ah Yu (Wei Tang), his wife, and their two small children. They live a simple life in a cozy cabin. One day, while at work, two thieves show up at the paper mill, and demand money from the owner. The owner and his wife try to fight the robbers, with no success. Liu Jin-Xi hides from the thugs and tries to stay safe, but sooner and later gets involved in the action and, in his own way, also fights the delinquents. Eventually, he beats and kills them. He is celebrated as a hero in town, and remains humble at all times.Some time later, the police arrive to the town and begin an investigation. Everything is going well, but Detective Xu-Bai-Jiu (Takeshi Kaneshiro) doesn't buy the official story. He believes that Liu Jin-Xi is not who he claims to be, because the two thieves that he killed where two of the most dangerous and skilled criminals sought by the justice in those parts. He decides to stay in town to further investigate Liu Jin-Xi, convinced that he is Tang Long, the second in command of the 72 Demons gang, one of the most ferocious gangs in the region. Liu Jin-Xi denies it, but Detective Xu-Bai-Jiu doesn't give up, his belief being that ""only physiology and the law don't lie,"" and that ""men are just stinking sacks of fluids with no redeeming qualities."" His obsession with Liu Jin-Xi will open a Pandora's Box that will alter the peace of this little town ""at the southwestern edge of China.""Directed by Peter Ho-Sun Chan, ""Dragon"" will have you to the edge of your seat until the very end. It smart, colorful, and with awesome fights coordinated by Donnie Yen himself. This is great entertainment, the one that doesn't come from the repetitive minds of Hollywood. The Blu-ray includes a making of documentary, featurettes with Donnie Yen, and more.

488965,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,7885142892,C. Sawin,"[2, 2]","The opening credits have style bleed from every frame of film as you see the unusual patterns blood makes in other liquid and various different shots of the bloodstream and the nerves inside the body. Donnie Yen's first big action sequence is eye catching because it isn't what you're used to seeing from the Hong Kong action star. He seems to be doing nothing more than resisting his opponents and using their weight to his advantage. It's similar to how Jackie Chan fights (or doesn't fight) in ""Little Big Soldier."" The method in which Xu Baijiu analyzes crime scenes is really spectacular because the use of physiology is really outstanding. He mentally dissects everything that happens as Liu explains the events at the store. Compare it to how Sherlock Holmes mentally analyzed things in Guy Ritchie's version of ""Sherlock Holmes."" You see how the events actually occurred and everything slows down while Xu gets a closer look.Donnie Yen dives into some pretty dark territory here. The tales about his father, the horse he used to own, and how he was a convicted murderer is the complete opposite of the inspectors and revolutionaries he's portrayed in the past. Yen's acting is so believable though. He always has this smile on his face that's usually accompanied by nervous eye movements or a slight trembling in the rest of his body that seems to hint at him hiding something. He's on the verge of tears on more than one occasion and you can feel the rising tension between him and Xu Baijiu. When the eyes of an actor are able to the story of a film better than words ever could, you know you're in for something special.Takeshi Kaneshiro's performance is also extremely polished. He portrays a man that has been robbed of just about everything he believed in. He was on the brink of death at one point in his life and was never fully able to recover from that. The only thing he has left is enforcing the law. His obsession with Liu Jinxi comes off as unhealthy and kind of fruitless, but it also results in some of the most memorable scenes in the film. Xu fails to see that his mission for justice is costing the lives of everyone around him. Kaneshiro does an impeccable job of portraying a broken man clinging to life by a single thread.The last 20 minutes of ""Dragon"" take you completely by surprise. The conclusion of the last fight will make or break your opinion of the film. ""Dragon"" feels smarter than the average martial arts film thanks to the Xu Baijiu character being so into acupuncture and physiology. There's an emphasis on nerve endings and pressure points that is slightly reminiscent of ""Fist of the North Star"" as Donnie Yen actually shows several different emotions and delivers one of his finest performances to date while Takeshi Kaneshiro's impressive performance will be left imprinted in your mind. Unfortunately, this version of the film is at least 14 minutes shorter than the foreign release of the film. Nevertheless, ""Dragon"" delivers a few swift kicks and a barrage of bone crunching punches to the standard expectations of a remake. ""Dragon"" is a stunning display of martial arts action, mesmerizing detective work, and engaging performances.",4,An electric powerhouse with perceptive analyses,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,3187,"['opening', 'credits', 'have', 'style', 'bleed', 'frame', 'film', 'see', 'unusual', 'patterns', 'blood', 'other', 'liquid', 'various', 'different', 'shots', 'bloodstream', 'nerves', 'body', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'first', 'big', 'action', 'sequence', 'eye', 'catching', ""n't"", 'what', ""'re"", 'used', 'seeing', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'action', 'star', 'be', 'doing', 'nothing', 'more', 'resisting', 'opponents', 'using', 'weight', 'advantage', 'similar', 'how', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'fights', ""n't"", 'fight', 'Little', 'Big', 'Soldier', 'method', 'Xu', 'Baijiu', 'crime', 'scenes', 'really', 'spectacular', 'use', 'physiology', 'really', 'outstanding', 'mentally', 'everything', 'Liu', 'events', 'store', 'Compare', 'how', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'mentally', 'analyzed', 'things', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'version', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'see', 'how', 'events', 'actually', 'occurred', 'everything', 'slows', 'down', 'Xu', 'closer', 'look.Donnie', 'Yen', 'pretty', 'dark', 'territory', 'here', 'tales', 'father', 'horse', 'used', 'own', 'how', 'was', 'convicted', 'murderer', 'complete', 'opposite', 'inspectors', 'portrayed', 'past', 'Yen', 'acting', 'so', 'believable', 'though', 'always', 'smile', 'face', 'usually', 'accompanied', 'nervous', 'eye', 'movements', 'slight', 'trembling', 'rest', 'body', 'hint', 'hiding', 'something', 'verge', 'tears', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'can', 'feel', 'rising', 'tension', 'Xu', 'Baijiu', 'When', 'eyes', 'actor', 'are', 'able', 'story', 'film', 'better', 'words', 'ever', 'could', 'know', ""'re"", 'something', 'special.Takeshi', 'Kaneshiro', 'performance', 'also', 'extremely', 'polished', 'man', 'been', 'robbed', 'just', 'everything', 'believed', 'was', 'brink', 'death', 'one', 'point', 'life', 'was', 'never', 'fully', 'able', 'recover', 'only', 'thing', 'left', 'enforcing', 'law', 'obsession', 'Liu', 'Jinxi', 'off', 'unhealthy', 'kind', 'fruitless', 'also', 'results', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'film', 'Xu', 'fails', 'see', 'mission', 'justice', 'costing', 'lives', 'everyone', 'Kaneshiro', 'impeccable', 'job', 'portraying', 'broken', 'man', 'clinging', 'life', 'single', 'thread.The', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'Dragon', 'take', 'completely', 'surprise', 'conclusion', 'last', 'fight', 'will', 'make', 'break', 'opinion', 'film', 'Dragon', 'feels', 'smarter', 'average', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'thanks', 'Xu', 'Baijiu', 'character', 'being', 'so', 'acupuncture', 'physiology', 'emphasis', 'nerve', 'endings', 'pressure', 'points', 'slightly', 'reminiscent', 'Fist', 'North', 'Star', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'actually', 'several', 'different', 'emotions', 'delivers', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'date', 'Takeshi', 'Kaneshiro', 'impressive', 'performance', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'imprinted', 'mind', 'Unfortunately', 'version', 'film', 'least', '14', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'foreign', 'release', 'film', 'Nevertheless', 'Dragon', 'few', 'swift', 'kicks', 'barrage', 'bone', 'crunching', 'punches', 'standard', 'expectations', 'remake', 'Dragon', 'stunning', 'display', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'mesmerizing', 'detective', 'work', 'engaging', 'performances']","Wu Xia [2011, HK] (a.k.a Wuxia) DVD - Uncut Foil Cover Edition"

488970,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,7885142892,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 3]","Filmmaker Peter Chan (""The Warlords"", ""Perhaps Love"", ""Comrades: Almost a Love Story"") and writer Oi Wah Lam (""Purple Storm"", ""Perhaps Love"" and ""The Warlords) are best known for their film collaborations in Hong Kong.And the two return with their exciting, action-packed martial arts film ""Dragon"" (""Wu-Xia"") starring Donnie Yen (""Ip Man"", ""Hero"", ""Iron Monkey""), Takeshi Kaneshiro (""Chungking Express"", ""House of Flying Daggers"", ""Red Cliff"") and Wei Tang (""Lust, Caution"", ""Man-Choo"", ""Finding Mr. Right"").The film was nominated for eleven Hong Kong Film Awards and won two awards for ""Best Cinematography"" and ""Best Original Score"" and did very well in the Chinese box office grossing over 100 million yuan on opening week.VIDEO:""Dragon"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and presented in 2:35:1.  While picture quality is very good, with lush surroundings and very good set design to capture China ala 1917.  What captures your attention throughout the film is the choreographed fighting.  Both Yiu-Fai Lai and Jake Pollock did a magnificent job of capturing the fight scenes, and the use of CG to give the feeling that the location of where the film was shot is near the cliffs and waterfall, the combination of real scenery and green screen was used effectively.Close-ups of characters show plenty of detail and black levels are nice and deep.  For the most part, picture quality is very good for the film!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Dragon"" is presented in Mandarin Chinese 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  While the film benefits from its action and the breaking of wood to people being thrown all over the place, the film's lossless soundtrack can be summed up with clear dialogue, beautiful musical score from Kwong Wing Chan, Peter Kam and Chatchai Pongpraphan and crowd ambiance.  For the most part, the lossless soundtrack was very good, not very immersive but yet appropriate for this film.Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Dragon"" comes with the following special features:The Making of Dragon - (22:27) Risks and Rewards, Framing the Action, Choosing Jimmy Wang Yu, A Different Role for Takeshi Kaneshiro, The Ins and Outs of Acupuncture, Family Dynamics, Tang Wei in the Countryside, Wai Ying Hung on Working with Donnie Yen.Featurette with Donnie Yen - (5:40) Featuring three featurettes featuring Donnie Yen: Staging the Action, Influences and Inspiration and On Set, On Location.""Lost in Jianghu"" Music Video - (5:14) Music video for ""Lost in Jianghu"", theme of ""Dragon"".JUDGMENT CALL:When it comes to Asian cinema, the fact is that filmmaker Peter Chan has worked on some major films from ""Comrades: Almost a Love Story"", ""The Warlords"" and ""Perhaps Love"", producers know they are getting a director who has consecutively led to box office hits.And part of that is due to Peter Chan managing to land the top stars of Asia in his films.  And with ""Dragon"", it's no different.  Box office hit in China and you have two of the top Asian talents starring in the film, Donnie Yen and Takeshi Kaneshiro.Donnie Yen is a staple of martial arts films especially in the last few years, after seeing ""Ip Man"", you can't see him doing anything less than that.  And what I like about Donnie Yen's involvement in a film is that he pushes for amazing fight choreography and does not take on martial arts films that are weak when it comes to fighting.  And like his previous ""Ip Man"" films, ""Dragon"" showcases that fantastic flair of fight choreography at the highest level.As for Takeshi Kaneshiro, you have one of the best dramatic actors.  He may not be a martial arts fighter but he makes it up in the more dramatic scenes.  In this case, an investigator who knows there is more to Liu Jinxi (portrayed by Donnie Yen) that meets the eye.  A relentless investigator seeking out the truth, the things he does in order to prove Liu Jinxi wrong, definitely is surprising as he intentionally pushes Liu off a bridge or sticks a sickle on his shoulder.You also get actress Wei Tang who took a risk in Ang Lee's 2007 film ""Lust, Caution"" and as a result for participating in the film, she was blacklisted by the Chinese government and losing endorsement deals.  Despite being 34-years of age, she still manages to look very young on camera.  But she provides another dramatic angle as a wife who wants to stick by her husband and hopes he doesn't abandon the children, when his past life is revealed.As for the Blu-ray release, while picture quality and the lossless soundtrack are very good.  You also get a good amount of special features which I'm happy to see included on this Blu-ray release (as many Asian films released in the USA tend to skimp on special features).While I enjoyed ""Dragon"" for being one of the enjoyable martial arts films I have seen so far in 2013, having watched so many Peter Chan, Donnie Yen and Takeshi Kaneshiro films, it's hard for me to say this is their best film.  Enjoyable...yes.  Awesome fight choreography...yes.  But an engaging storyline?  If anything, it was a bit more of a popcorn action martial arts film and nothing more or less than that.The film tries to explain the deep hate that Liu Jin-xi has towards his father, but it would have been great to establish visually of why we should despite his father and helping set up this amazing confrontation between father and estranged son.  Also, the film ends with somewhat of uncertainty.Overall, ""Dragon"" is an exciting martial arts film with amazing fight choreography!  While I have seen better Peter Chan, Donnie Yen and Takeshi Kaneshiro films, there is no doubt that martial arts action film fans will enjoy ""Dragon"".  It's definitely one of the better martial arts films I have seen on video released in 2013 so far!Recommended!",4,"(3.5 Stars)  ""Dragon"" is an exciting martial arts film with amazing fight choreography!

488971,ACW4P33TPKDWW,7885142892,Drew from Oregon,"[0, 1]","I was fortunate enough to receive a copy of Dragon to review and below are my thoughts.  This review does contain some spoilers.Dragon is an action packed martial arts film mixed in with a little science and mystery, which makes for an interesting film.When the movie starts, we can see that there is a bit of mysticism as we get to see the beautiful landscape.  Taking place in the early 20th Century, Jin-xi (Donnie Yen) is a papermaker working at a general store.  Two gangsters come into the store and start to rob the place; however, Jin-xi, who was initially in hiding, comes out and starts to fight the robbers.  The fight didn't look too special, it looked like a struggle, like most normal fights would, and he finally kills both robbers and he is hailed as a hero in the village.Xu Bai-jiu (Takeshi Kaneshiro) comes to town to investigate the crime scene.  It turns out one of the gangsters that Jin-xi killed was a notorious criminal who had escaped from prison and he was a highly trained killer.  Xu has his suspicions as to how a simple papermaker could kill a convict with such skill.  As Xu interviews the people throughout the village and Jin-xi's family, he finds out that Jin-xi showed up out of nowhere roughly five years prior.  Jin-xi's wife said that he had a fight with his family and he ran away from home.Xu finally gets the chance to interrogate Jin-xi to get his side of the story as to what happened and how the fight transpired.  As Jin-xi is describing how he fought the two robbers, Xu has a different picture in his head of how the fight went down and we see a completely different scene of the same fight and how Jin-xi was really able to defeat the two men.  It appears Jin-xi was fighting in somewhat of a supernatural way and he eventually summoned ""Qi"" energy (a life force, energy flow, or life energy) and was ready to kill.After Xu finds out about Jin-xi's supernatural abilities, he performs a little test on Jin-xi by pushing him over a bridge.  Jin-xi falls on some really small branches, which should have broken, but he hangs there for a bit before dropping into the water.  Xu concludes, with a little bit of science, that Jin-xi is able to, essentially, defy gravity.  This gives Xu even more confirmation that Jin-xi is not really the person he claims to be.  After investigating a bit Xu talks to Jin-xi again and Jin-xi confesses that he was a convicted murderer and had spent time in prison, but got out because of an amnesty.  He claimed that his father, a butcher, made him kill a man who owed them money.  After hearing this, Xu doesn't believe Jin-xi because he sees that his Qi energy is repelling flies, so he takes a sharp object, a sickle, and attacks Jin-xi with it thinking it would not cut him.  Xu was right, although the sickle cut Jin-xi a bit, it didn't cut him as it would have a normal person.Xu eventually finds out that Jin-xi is actually Tang Long who was second-in-command of the notorious criminals, the 72 Demons.  It turns out that Jin-xi actually killed a family of butchers and he was never a butcher's son.  After finding this out, Xu seems to be somewhat scared of Jin-xi now and he goes to Feng County to get an arrest warrant.The master of the 72 Demons, Jin-xi's father, wants him back, so he sends some people to go get him.  As the 72 Demons members arrive in the village, Jin-xi is being awarded an award of integrity, so all the people are there to watch.  Jin-xi, defiant to not go back to the 72 Demons, fights the people sent for him.  At this point, the people in the village, and even Jin-xi's wife, get to see his supernatural fighting skills.  This is how Jin-xi's wife finds out that he is really not who he says he is.  After some excellent fighting sequences, Jin-xi finally defeats the people who were after him.Xu, finally realizing that Jin-xi does not want to be a member of the 72 Demons, eventually decides to help Jin-xi try to get out.  They both come up with a scheme to make the 72 Demons think that Jin-xi is dead; however, that is foiled.  In order to get out, Jin-xi cuts off his arm in front of the 72 Demons and tells them that he is done with their group.  The 72 Demons finally leave and Jin-xi goes home only to find his father there with his family.  Jin-xi fights his father because his father tried to kill his son when he found out that Jin-xi wanted out of the 72 Demons.  Xu helps Jin-xi with the fight and he dies in the process.  Jin-xi's father finally dies from a strike of lightning and, at this point, Jin-xi knows that he can finally live in peace with his family.Overall, Dragon is an excellent movie with some great fight sequences and cinematography.  It is not too often that you come across a movie that moves you both physically and emotionally at the same time and Dragon does just that.  In my opinion, this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time and I strongly suggest this movie to almost anyone as this is a must have for any movie collection.  It's very rare I do this, but I give this movie a 5/5 stars.  I enjoyed the fight scenes, the characters were excellent in their roles, and the beauty of the landscape captured on film is almost unmatched.Special features include:  The Making of Dragon,

488973,A1EGZYG8PC51U5,7885142892,"D. Wilson ""SonRisedInTheEast""","[9, 10]","Let's get this out of the way quickly: there are 2 DVD versions of this film, an awful bootleg version(title is in white towards the left side with a full photo shot of three characters) and this very nice Media Asia version(yellow cover with green foil lettering and 2 small figures).  It's worth the extra money.  So now on to the film itself... Donnie Yen plays Jinxi, a quiet, well respected family man in a small village.  One day he stops a burglary, killing two dangerous criminals in the process accidentally-- or was it?  Police detective Xu Bai(played in quirky fashion as only Takeshi Kaneshiro can) is on the case, and unwilling to believe there isn't more to Jinxi than he lets' on.  Director Peter Chan shows no lag coming off the enjoyable Warlords, only this time he's traded action star Jet Li in for Donnie Yen-- and Donnie brings his A game!  Astonishing as a performer in his own action direction is a given, but Yen showcases some real acting skill in the more quiet moments of the movie, which hasn't always been the case(but the action is always so good you can look past some stiff deliveries).

Donnie Yen comes close- very close! His fighting style is different, especially with regards to his facial expressions. I know that seems like a strange comparison, but it's true. Bruce Lee, while fighting, looked like a man filled with rage- an unbridled energy and force of nature. Donnie Yen fights with an expression of perfect peace- fully aware of everything that surrounds him, and in total control... of everything. For me, where they are alike is in the lightning speed they both posses. I know- this is cinema and anything can be faked- but I don't believe this is. Mr. Yen uses more wire work than Mr. Lee did, but it's the up close fighting that takes your breath away- then and now. I cannot do justice to the pure brilliance of these two men, separated by 40 years. And what about the movie itself? I thoroughly enjoyed it- start to finish.

In reality, this film is SO much more.  Part action flick and part mystery, DRAGON ensnares you from the opening sequence and never lets go.  With mind-bending fight scenes and an enthralling enigma, this is one film that you will not want to miss.I have to confess that I liked DRAGON more than I was expecting to.  Much more, in fact.  I figured, after reading the plot synopsis, that I was going to enjoy it, but wow...it almost blew me away.  The fight scenes are intense and unique, the plot is paced well and unravels the mystery perfectly, and the acting is great as well.  You really can't ask for much else.Donnie Yen, the actor that portrays the main character, is a phenomenal talent on-screen and I always enjoy his work.  In this particular role, we get to see his versatility as an actor; one minute he plays a daft paper-mill worker in the small village, but the next he's playing a cool, calculating assassin.  It's truly inspiring to see his ability to shift gears like this.DRAGON is shot very well and the action scenes are top-notch.  But the story is what really wins the mark.  There's plenty of intrigue and emotional drama in this film, but it never bogs down.  The pacing is perfect and the answer to the mystery of Liu's background unfolds just as it should.I highly recommend giving DRAGON a look.  This film has a little something for everyone.  If you like martial arts action, you're in for a real treat; Donnie Yen choreographed the fight scenes, so they're filled with adrenaline-fueled mayhem.  And you if you enjoy a mystery, there's enough intrigue here to make Sherlock Holmes proud.

An incident in which two robbers are killed by Jinxi brings the notice of an obsessive inspector Xu Baijiu (Takeshi Kaneshiro) who is determined to reveal what he believes to be the truth.Yen brings the same depth and intensity, if not just a tad bit more, to Jinxi that he brings to any of his roles. He just seems to get better with every movie he makes. Takeshi Kaneshiro nearly steals the show from him as well, playing the near insanity of his character with spellbinding perfection. Even if the story wasn't so interesting, I would probably give the film very high marks for their brilliant performances alone.There is not as much wall to wall action as some of Yen's other films, but there is still plenty of it and it is some of his hardest hitting yet. It's shot beautifully, and the choreography does the wonderful trick of keeping in mind the established personalities of the characters fighting.The only reason I don't give this a full 5 star mark is that the story begins extremely strongly in the first half, but gets a little loose in the second half once the action begins, which as expected as that may be, is still a bit disapponting.

489020,A238W7T3KJAKQH,7885142892,shaun brammer,"[1, 1]","When I was young Martial Arts movies, then just called Kung Fu movies, were pretty simple. They were also cheesy. You watched them to see the fighting, the tricks and the stunts that western movies just couldn&#8217;t do, not for the acting and certainly not for the story. As the decades have gone by these films have gotten sleeker and sharper. The action has become a real cinematic event that more than rivals the CGI explosions of Hollywoods biggest budgets. In modern Martial Arts films a few actors in a small room can create a breath taking ballet of action. However, this is not the only area in which these films have made improvements. They have become more clever. Their stories are better thought out, and played out. They have developed more complex aspects that their predecessors lacked. One such film that is an excellent example of the evolution of Martial Arts films is Dragon or Wu Xia.Wu Xia is a dark criminal investigation in to the true identity of a killer in early Twentieth Century China. The killer is a simple paper maker named Liu Jinxi, played by Martial Arts icon Donnie Yen. Liu Jinxi is married to Liu Yu, played by Tang Wei. He also has two sons, one adopted and one his own through his marriage. When some thugs enter the shop, in which Jinxi is replacing the paper on the windows, and begin beating the owners for money they owe, he takes action to defend them. At first it seems Jinxi gets lucky in his clumsy attack of the criminals as both end up dead by accident. Authorities are called in after the attack and a detective, Xu Baijiu, played by Takeshi Kaneshiro, just doesn&#8217;t believe the simple paper maker&#8217;s account of the events. Similar to a 1940&#8216;s Hollywood noir detective, who just can&#8217;t let the case close, Baijiu follows Jinxi around for awhile and asks questions, observes him and even puts him through some tests. In the end Baijiu determines that Liu Jinxi is not who he says he is, he is in fact Tang Long, the son of the leader of a ruthless gang of murders know as the 72 Demons. Tang Long wanted redemption from his past crimes and wanted to start a new life where he could be a good man. Because of Baijiu&#8217;s insistence on arresting Tang Long for his past crimes, the 72 Demons learn where he has been hiding for the last ten years and go to the village to bring him back to his father.First I would like to say that I loved the acting in this film. There was nothing overly dramatic, but the actors played their parts well. Yen played his character as a confused peasant at one point and a distraught man the next. Yen is an actor that I don&#8217;t think gets his proper due from western audiences. Other Martial Arts actors like Jackie Chan and Jet Li get more press and recognition than Yen. Yet, Yen is a skilled actor as well as a Martial Artist. His direction of the fight sequences in this film are really intense and fun. Close quarters combat is the theme of the fights within Dragon and Yen does a marvelous job. Takeshi played a nerdy and persistent detective. He plays something like a fidgety Sherlock, who instead of injecting himself with cocaine is addicted to acupuncture techniques. His acupuncture skill is also the basis of his forensics knowledge, which makes him such a sharp detective. He also has conversations with himself, literally, for it seems like he is a little nuts. Baijiu has an internal struggle over the value of humanity and the value of law. He always wants to the law to triumph, and doesn&#8217;t want to trust people, yet he has a deep compassionate side that always wants to intervene with inhumane laws. That side doesn&#8217;t get to interfere that often however. This internal debate mirrors an on going struggle between the ancient philosophies of Kongzi (Confucius) and Han Fei-zi, the father of Legalism. This debate costed Baijiu his marriage, so it weights heavily on him. Then there is Jimmy Wang. Jimmy plays Tang Long&#8217;s father and makes quite a terrifying gang leader. He has a commanding presence and a deep voice, like James Earl Jones, and he sounds demonic. While he is not seen much through out the movie he makes the film. You easily understand why Tang Long would run from such an abusive and evil person. On a side note, Jimmy Wang played the starring role in the 1967 Shaw Brothers production One-armed Swordsman, which Dragon (Wu Xia) plays tribute to near the end of the film.Second, the cinematography is stunning. Scenes are shot one way and then replayed differently as Baijiu discovers more of the truth. There are time controlled close ups and spinning angles, all of which brings the action close to the viewer. The background is lush southern China. So, the scenery takes on a dark wet, and wild look with compacted forests of green that are cut through with rushing rivers. The story moves from those untamed wilds outside the village that Liu Jinxi lives in and the village itself. The level of detail in the village is great, everything looks old and highly used. The colors of the clothes are drab and the wood of the buildings is black with age. This isn&#8217;t a dirty place, but a comfortable, well lived in place. This film is not a plush and polished Kung Fu film, it is much closer to the earth, so to speak. I am not sure if these locations really exist, but knowing what I know of the ares in question they could be. I certainly hope they are. Even if they don&#8217;t, they can be enjoyed in the film.Dragon (Wu Xia) is not a very long film. The story moves quickly, for it is meant to entertain. This is not a historical epic that needs at least two hours of explaining, like Red Cliff. However, this is not a non-stop face kicking film either. There are fight scenes but they don&#8217;t dominate the screen time. This is a story driven Martial Arts film, which is another evolutionary development of the genre. The action becomes even more gripping and moving when the context is well established through a strong story, which Dragon has. The themes are deep, compassion vs. law, redemption vs. punishment, past actions vs current actions and which defines the person. All of this is brought together with amazing action scenes in engaging settings. Dragon is a must see for lovers of the genre, but like many modern Martial Arts films, it is an easy crossover to be enjoyed by anyone who likes a good story, especially one with a dark coating.",5,Nior Fu,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,6425,"['When', 'was', 'young', 'Martial', 'Arts', 'movies', 'then', 'just', 'called', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'movies', 'were', 'pretty', 'simple', 'were',

489029,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,7885142892,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","[THIS IS A REVIEW ABOUT THE FILM ITSELF, NOT THE QUALITY OF DVD]Set in a 1917 small village in Yunnan Province, ""Wu Xia"" follows a story of Liu Jinxi (Donnie Yen, ""Ip Man""), an ordinary worker with his wife Ayu (Tang Wei, ""Lust, Caution"") and two sons. To investigate the deaths of two bandits robbing the local shop, Xu Baijiu (Takeshi Kaneshiro, ""Red Cliff""), a detective with a strong sense of justice, is sent to the village, where he meets mild-mannered Liu Jinxi. Being an expert of physiology, the detective suspects that a peaceful family man Liu Jinxi is not what he appears.As the title says, ""Wu Xia"" is a Chinese martial arts film, of which story resembles that of ""History of Violence"" or ""Reign of Assassins."" Director Peter Chan (""Warlords"") gives a twist to the film's plotline, of which first half features ""Rashomon""-like inquiry into truth by detective Xu Baijiu, visually re-enacting what really happened to the dead robbers. Donnie Yen and Kenji Tanigaki deliver solid action stunts, though a bit too brief.Two veteran actors (I will mention later again) arrive in the second half, and the film becomes more conventional in storytelling, leaning more on the action side. That does not mean the story is predictable, however. Kaneshiro's character steps aside, letting Donnie Yen's reluctant hero do what he can do. And he does it brilliantly.""Wu Xia"" is notable for casting two seasoned players working from the days of the Shaw Brothers studio. Yu Wang, the hero of ""The One-Armed Swordsman"" (1967), makes his first on-screen appearance in 18 years as charismatic ""Master,"" fighting another one-armed warrior here. Kara Hui, heroine of Shaw Brothers' ""My Young Auntie"" (1981) is also impressive in the intense martial arts fight scenes with Donnie Yen.Unlike some reviewers, I didn't find interesting Kaneshiro's character, mostly sidelined in the second half of the film, perhaps because I wanted Donnie Yen action, not a psychological drama. After all, the film is ""Wu Xia"" and it delivers goods, but some viewers may feel differently, who want more of the film's Sherlock Holmes-like detective.",4,(3.5 STARS) Donnie Yen and a Master Sleuth (with Two Shaw Brothers Stars),1334966400,"04 21, 2012",2012,2119,"['[', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'THE', 'FILM', 'ITSELF', 'NOT', 'THE', 'QUALITY', 'OF', 'DVD', ']', 'Set', '1917', 'small', 'village', 'Yunnan', 'Province', 'Wu', 'Xia', 'story', 'Liu', 'Jinxi', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'Ip', 'Man', 'ordinary', 'worker', 'wife', 'Ayu', 'Tang', 'Wei', 'Lust', 'Caution', 'two', 'sons', 'investigate', 'deaths', 'two', 'bandits', 'robbing', 'local', 'shop', 'Xu', 'Baijiu', 'Takeshi', 'Kaneshiro', 'Red', 'Cliff', 'detective', 'strong', 'sense', 'justice', 'sent', 'village', 'where', 'mild-mannered', 'Liu', 'Jinxi', 'Being', 'expert', 'physiology', 'detective', 'suspects', 'peaceful', 'family', 'man', 'Liu', 'Jinxi', 'not', 'what', 'title', 'Wu', 'Xia', 'Chinese', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'story', 'History', 'Violence', 'Reign', 'Assassins', 'Director', 'Peter', 'Chan', 'Warlords', 'twist', 'film', 'plotline', 'first', 'half', 'Rashomon', '-like', 'inquiry', 'truth', 'detective', 'Xu', 'Baijiu', 'visually', 're-enacting', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'dead', 'robbers', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'Kenji', 'Tanigaki', 'deliver', 'solid', 'action', 'stunts', 'bit', 'too', 'brief.Two', 'veteran', 'actors', 'will', 'mention', 'later', 'again', 'arrive', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'more', 'conventional', 'storytelling', 'leaning', 'more', 'action', 'side', 'not', 'mean', 'story', 'predictable', 'however', 'Kaneshiro', 'character', 'steps', 'aside', 'letting', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'brilliantly', 'Wu', 'Xia', 'notable', 'casting', 'two', 'seasoned', 'players', 'working', 'days', 'Shaw', 'Brothers', 'studio', 'Yu', 'Wang', 'hero', 'One-Armed', 'Swordsman', '1967', 'first', 'on-screen', 'appearance', '18', 'years', 'charismatic', 'Master', 'fighting', 'one-armed', 'warrior', 'here', 'Kara', 'Hui', 'heroine', 'Shaw', 'Brothers', 'Young', 'Auntie', '1981', 'also', 'impressive', 'intense', 'martial', 'arts', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Donnie', 'Yen.Unlike', 'reviewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'interesting', 'Kaneshiro', 'character', 'mostly', 'sidelined', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'perhaps', 'wanted', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'action', 'not', 'psychological', 'drama', 'film', 'Wu', 'Xia', 'goods', 'viewers', 'may', 'feel', 'differently', 'who', 'want', 'more', 'film', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes-like', 'detective']","Wu Xia [2011, HK] (a.k.a Wuxia) DVD - Uncut Foil Cover Edition"
