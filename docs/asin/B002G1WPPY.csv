1267392,A1YG0WKFWO0VR2,B002G1WPPY,Dennis Huskins,"[0, 0]",Football is changing with more and more with restrictive rules that I could not play today. I love watching football back when it was football and Da Bears represent a toughness that is being compromised in modern era. I know head injuries are devastating and the risk to play is a choice. But it is a gladiator sport and if you take the risk and devastating impacts out of the game all that is left is two hand touch and I won't watch it. With the retiring of Ray Lewis (the 2nd greatest linebacker ever) it is fitting to say goodbye to football as we knew and loved it.Butkus (THE greatest LB ever) and Da Bears represent that legacy and this DVD is a reminder.,4,Butkus and Da Bears,1360022400,"02 5, 2013",2013,663,"['Football', 'changing', 'more', 'more', 'restrictive', 'rules', 'could', 'not', 'play', 'today', 'love', 'watching', 'football', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'football', 'Da', 'Bears', 'represent', 'toughness', 'being', 'compromised', 'modern', 'era', 'know', 'head', 'injuries', 'are', 'devastating', 'risk', 'play', 'choice', 'gladiator', 'sport', 'take', 'risk', 'devastating', 'impacts', 'game', 'left', 'two', 'hand', 'touch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'retiring', 'Ray', 'Lewis', '2nd', 'greatest', 'linebacker', 'ever', 'fitting', 'say', 'goodbye', 'football', 'knew', 'loved', 'it.Butkus', 'THE', 'greatest', 'LB', 'ever', 'Da', 'Bears', 'represent', 'legacy', 'DVD', 'reminder']",N/A
1267393,A38O27BDP2QECS,B002G1WPPY,"Erik R. Swierk ""Mr Busy Busy""","[1, 1]",This is a GREAT DVD set we got for our son who like us is a HUGE Bears fan.  What we like most is that it doesn't focus entirely on the most recent players and really has a great span of information from start to finish.  It's a fun time watching the great plays and players captured on film.  I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates football and not just Bears fans because many of the players covered that really shaped the game that is played today.

1267394,A343CRJ1JDE6RP,B002G1WPPY,"J. M. Jacobs ""Just one man's opinion...""","[12, 12]","Born in 1952, I was just old enough to notice NFL football when the Bears drafted Dick Butkus at Middle Linebacker. I was a running back on my grade school football team but also a defensive back, so I LOVED Gale Sayers and gradually grew to love Mr. Butkus as well. To this day his style of play and his attitude towards opponents is why I love Chicago Bear football.Butkus was one of those physically strong men who you can identify simply by shaking their hand. When he hit a guy, he folded up like a rubber table at the church social... and sometimes they stayed hit to the point of being carried off the field.That kind of defensive punishment has been the hallmark of great Bear teams throughout their history and is documented in this video.Butkus, Singletary, and now Urlacher... you get to see them all in action here. There have been other heavy hitters on the Bears' defense over the years (Ed O'Bradovich, Jim Dent, Gary Fencik, Otis Wilson and Wilber Marshall) but these three gentlemen of the middle define the lineage that is passed down from year to year.There is a nice segment devoted to the 1985 Super Bowl team under Buddy Ryan as Defensive Coordinator. There is no argument that that defense was one of the all-time greats in NFL history. 'Intimidation' isn't a strong enough word to define what those boys brought to the table. I recall that they tended to elicit some measure of fear in the QB's they faced that year. For example, opposing offenses did not score a single point in their first two playoff games prior to the Super Bowl.As a fan of NFL Football, if you love watching a good defense take apart a nice, shiny offense, you will love this disc... and you won't even have to be a Bears' fan first.",5,"'Monsters of the Midway'...?
