It saddens me so  much that people can relate positively to a story filled with nothing but numbskull idiots bent on making one foolish decision after the other.

When I took it home and watched it, I was pleasantly surprised. This film is seriously funny!The film centers around Shawn, who is on parole and trying to get the almighty dollar fast. The film follows him through his adventures with breaking and entering, yet trying to keep his life on track. It'll have you rolling!Since the film was directed by Damon Dash, CEO of Roc-A-Fella records, the film is filled with cameos by Jay-Z, Memphis Bleek, and Dash himself. Beanie Siegel also gives a convincing performance as a crazy and extremely violent acquaintance of Shawn's. Angie Martinez, Tiffany Withers (from BET's bet.com), and Stacy Dash also have roles in the filmDon't let the fact that this is a straight-to-video film.
