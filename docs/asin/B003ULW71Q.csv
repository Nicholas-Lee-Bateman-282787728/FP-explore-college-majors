After this DVD you feel the burn in EVERY muscle (even those you either didn't know you have or haven't used in a long time). I wouldn't suggest this to a beginner (it is too long and hard). This isn't a DVD I do often but I do like it when I have the time to do it. I would suggest his ultimate cardio and body transformation.

Bob pushes you further than you think you can possibly go, and then he pushes you some more.  This series is intense.

It includes some jump training to ensure your heart rate is up for maximum results.

The worst thing about it was the poor form in many of the exercises, to which Bob was only yelling ""faster, faster, faster"" which iMO is totally irresponsible. This is supposed to be done with sufficiently heavy weight so that his approach combined with poor form displayed in the video is a recipe for injury. For strength training I'll just stick to Cathe.

1366222,A3BXKZ89LDCWD1,B003ULW71Q,Algernon,"[4, 4]","This DVD is no joke. I've been doing it for a few months now -- it's my kick-butt Sunday workout in a 5- to 6-day-per-week regiment -- and I don't think it's ever going to get easier. Or, hell, manageable. It's hard. Really, really hard. And if it isn't hard for you, you're either doing it wrong or you're being a wuss about how much weight you're using.My husband and I work out together and we react very differently to this workout, even though we both love it in the end because it's effective. The husband hears the ""Come on!! Do it!! Now do it again!!!"" and gets energized. I hear it and want to punch Harper in the face. But it's the kind of hate/anger that just fuels me to finish.I have a bad back, so some modifications are required. For starters, I don't beat myself up for dropping to my knees for push-ups and plank variations because there are SO MANY of them that I must modify in order to keep proper form through the end. And I still feel it big time. In fact, once I let myself drop to my knees in the final killer plank series (hold plank, then lower/lift your abs, followed by swiveling your hips), I finally felt what Harper was going for. Before, I wasn't hitting the right spots. Proper form means you're doing it right. Eventually maybe I'll be able to stay up, but my back is bad for reasons other than a weak core, so we'll see. I'll still kill myself with the modifications -- in a good way.After this workout, my shoulders kill, the back of my thighs, my butt, my triceps, my core and my delts. Today's particularly rough as yesterday I went up 2 lbs. for most of the routine. But then, every day after this routine is rough. It's a killer workout with good production value and a refreshing display of I'm-dyin'-here backup exercisers drenched in sweat. If any one of those jerks had been smiling ever in this workout, I might have tossed my TV out the window. At least I can see they're suffering, too.I hate it.

1366224,A2FMPWCAQSQJ2E,B003ULW71Q,Amazon Customer,"[2, 3]","This workout is tough, no doubt. It will push you to your limits. Bob acts as your personal trainer and is very pushy (I wish he would work out himself). There are 3 exercisers in great shape at different levels. This workout works them and you so hard that the movements become sloppy (the 3 exercisers have this problem too) because you're so exhausted. However, when I lift weights, I find it important to keep form at all times. In my opinion this is important for results as well as to prevent injury. It's a strenuous workout without rest, so it gets you winded and you will sweat buckets but you must be experienced enough to know when you lose form and how to modify. In this DVD, Bob is exceptionally hard on the exercisers and the message is that it has to be hard work and no fun or it won't be effective. I'm an exercise addict (25+ years) and I completely disagree with that. I love strenuous exercise but I'm not motivated by a bad-ass attitude, so I took a star away, however this is till a very good workout. There is also a second workout, about 20 minutes in length with its own warm-up that focuses on legs, abs and balance. I really liked that one.

With Bob's new dvds, I never feel like going to the gym anymore! These dvds are excellent, particularly Pure Burn: Super Strength.  Bob moves through multiple exercises for each muscle group and using a variety of upper-lower body combinations.  I find that when I can't do any more work for one muscle group to save my life, Bob moves on to a different body part, giving those muscles a little recovery before he goes back to the first group.  It is very well-paced in this regard, allowing you to make it through the full hour.Though I consider myself an inetermediate-advanced exerciser (5-6 days a week), I have to admit that I don't do the workout as fully as Bob's assistants do.  The one time I went ""all out"" at full intensity (dropping an extra two inches in a squat when Bob said to, etc), I made it for 40 minutes but was in absolute agony the next two days!  I have noticed an improvement in my muscle tone and a few weeks in, I am able to complete many more reps with weights than I was when I started.I have been rotating this dvd with Bob's Cardio Conditioning (also highly recommended) and the Biggest Loser Last Chance Workout on days when I don't have much time, with some of Jillian Michaels' workouts thrown in.

1366233,A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,B003ULW71Q,Chandler,"[64, 69]","Wow, this workout is so different from Bob's other ones, yet it retains all the things I loved about his other DVDsFirst, I must say that I collect fitness DVDs like some women buy shoes...I like to rotate them to keep me inspired and try new ones to retain motivation. While I may not always have time to make it to the gym, I typically can drag myself to do a routine at home even in a time crunch. So, I do have all his previous DVDs.CALORIE BURN:I wear a bodybugg with a digital display to show me how many calories I'm burning during a workout but also continue reading the burn after the workout is over. That way I can not only compare a workout DVD to others during the workout, but also see how many calories it burned AFTER the workout is over in ramping up the metabolism. This is especially important with a strength training DVD because, while a cardio DVD will burn more calories DURING the workout, a good strength training DVD will burn less during the workout but will continue burning long after the workout is over, and build muscle so that you burn more calories even at rest. I mention all this only so you know my calorie burn measurement is based on scientific measurement rather than perceived exertion...and Bob knew how to ""work it"" in this routine. In fact, it's the one Bob Harper or Biggst Loser DVD I'd say doesn't adjust as well as others for beginners. Even in the short routine I think you need to have some strength training experience before you jump into it. It not only works every muscle but burns far more calories than most pure strength DVDs due to him getting the heart rate up and working major muscle groups often even when working smaller muscles for the most benefit in less time...plus you don't stop during this workout to learn something...he teaches as you go so you don't miss a beat and neither do your muscles! BUT because of all this, you will get a 5 star calorie burn not usually seen with only strength training.DVD: This one is exceptionally well made. Gone are the Biggest Loser contestants behind him doing the moves wrong as though they just picked up the routine somewhat on the fly...the camera offers close up shots of how to do something in detail as Bob explains it and his back up team is serious about knowing how to do it RIGHT. The music is not the boring electronica found on many workout DVDs but an upbeat instrumental that is far more inspiring on a professional looking gym set.CUEING:Bob is always excellent, in my opinion, in not tripping you up. I say on all my DVD reviews of any fitness product that I am not exactly gifted in coordination and I never miss a beat or do a wrong move with his cueing. No different here but boy he really goes into great detail in the instruction. I don't know if he's taking off on his own doing more ""Bob Harper"" produced DVDs as compared to the old Biggest Loser ones but he really seemed ""into"" this routine and it seemed better produced to me. It may very well be the same production company but if so, they've moved up the quality.MOTIVATION:This is a trainer who is exceptionally comfortable on camera but retains a positive ""push"" as he drives you through the workout. I typically feel as though I have a great trainer right there in my living room rather than someone wanting their camera time. I am pushed, but it's also done with much positive motivation and thinking.INSTRUCTION:While I think this may be tough for someone who has NEVER done strength training to jump right into, the instruction is clear enough that you could, perhaps, with lighter weights or less reps. In other words, he simply won't allow you to do a move WRONG. You not only get clear instruction on what to do but reminders of what not to do so that you get the most gain from your workout.OVERVIEW:While you will get your heartrate up this isn't like most of the Biggest Loser DVDs that combine lots of cardio and strength. This one is truly focused on building muscle and building EVERY muscle...you will do enough reps at enough speed and form to utilize every muscle in your body from core to head to toe and do it WELL.Workouts: Start with the 20 minute workout...it's still a great workout and once you feel comfortable and able to take on the hour workout, he'll kick your arse. It's really a ""last chance workout"" routine as far as strength training goes.CONCLUSION: This will be on heavy rotation in my workout routine. while I try to get in lots of cardio, this is a full and complete strength training routine that, in my opinion, lacks nothing...it's so professionally done from camera to instruction to set to music to results that I don't have a negative opinion on it whatsoever...",5,This will CHANGE your body & it burns more calories than most straight strength DVDs,1294790400,"01 12, 2011",2011,4692,"['Wow', 'workout', 'so', 'different', 'Bob', 'other', 'ones',

This is a very intense workout and it is not for the faint of heart.  I've done The Biggest Loser DVD's, Jackie Warner, and Tamilee Webb which are all very good--but this one is probably the most challenging. I kid you not, even the women in the video, who appear to be muscular athletes, were crying towards the last 15 minutes or so.  (In their defense it did look like they were using the same weights the men were).Bob takes the standard exercise, such as push ups or plank position, and bumps it up notch by adding various movements within the movement.  For example, he has you do a push up to a side plank position with a weight in the hand...and then rotating this movement from one side to the other.I do agree that Bob is not the ""nice guy"" that we are all used to, however towards the end of the video he reminds us that he has our best interest at heart.  He says jokingly ""remember I'm the nice one"".  I can deal with his intensity as long as I keep this in mind. I just keep reminding myself ""bikini"" ""bikini""...""skinny jeans"" ""skinny jeans""...I did not notice the small print on the back which recommended using 1-2lb weights, so I started out with my 5lb weights only to find that I had to bump it down at some points to 3lbs due to the intensity and repetition.

I ordered this DVD expecting something similar to Jillian's 30 Day Shred, which I really like.First off, this guy is INSANE!!  This is someone that you want as a personal trainer.  He's even meaner than Jillian!  His reps are crazy long and had me yelling at the TV.  I attempted to do this workout with 8lb weights, which was a bad idea, as it was impossible for me to do all of the reps when it came to moves other than curls.  I definitely recommend having 5-6lb and 8lb weights for ladies.  You will definitely need the range!This workout is everything I wanted that I didn't get from Jillian's 30 Day Shred, particularly more time and more arm workouts.I had to pause the DVD like 5 times to wipe away the sweat that was pouring into my eyes.The people working out in the video were also great.  They are in awesome shape, and they were struggling and screaming throughout the workout.  I don't know if it was acting, but it definitely made me feel better about my own struggles.I wouldn't recommend the hour long workout to people who aren't in fairly decent shape.

The long workout is about 67 minutes long and there is a countdown on the screen (which I personally like) which also indicates what exercises are being done.  This is a nice feature but some people may have trouble reading this because the font is somewhat small and crowded.The workout only requires light to heavy hand weights (depending on your fitness level).  There is an approximately 7 minute warm up and then the exercises start.  There are three other exercisers, an advanced woman who is in phenomenal shape (and who has 4 kids!), a male intermediate, and woman doing the beginner exercises (she always looked like she was in pain or going to cry which I found distracting).  Many of the exercises incorporated core work although I don't think that there is a huge focus on abdominal muscles (unlike Jackie Warner's videos which makes my abs ache for days).  There are ALOT of pushups in this video and they pop up unexpectedly in many places.  There are also a lot of squats and some plyometrics.  The workout targets all the muscle groups and each muscle group is worked to the point of fatigue.  The workout ends with a good stretch.This workout is best for someone who is at least an intermediate exerciser and will definitely be a challenge to those in the advanced category.  In part, this is because the workout is really tough and because there is not a clear demonstration of proper form.  It is expected that you know how to do the exercises properly.  The workout could use some more creativity in the exercises chosen which are relatively standard (although hugely effective).  Because this workout is so intense and thorough, this is definitely one that will be in continuous rotation.This workout will appeal to anyone who enjoys Jari Love, Jillian Michaels, or Jackie Warner.

If you are a beginner, do not think about it! :) I call it ""extremely challenging"" based on: 1. if you can do each level of the ""30 day shred"" levels with good form and at least moderate weight, and 2. if ""No more trouble zones"" is just challenging or a little challenging, then try this. As Bob says, he wants to see what's left (of us / of our energy) at the end of the workout. With good form and adequate weights, the beginning is hard,and the middle keeps on giving in terms of challenge, but what truly makes the cut is how one does the last 20 minutes---if / when one gets there (still with good form and adequately challenging weights). Well, I for one can get to the end of the workout, but barely. Therefore, I will switch from 8 pounds to 5, and my goal is to make it like the exercisers on the video. The facial expressions of whoever and Bob's not being what he is on the BL (this is NOT the BL !) do not matter to me. I have too much to worry about my own sweat and facial expressions to care about others, who, mind you, are able to do the entire program from beginning to end. Maybe this video could be labeled a video for trainers, not so much trainees if the latter are just enthusiasts, but not strongly committed to push themselves as far as they can go. The day I can do this entire exercise routine in good form and with somewhat heavy weights, I'll call myself an athlete. I'm not there yet.

Well, I had to grunt several times during the hour-long workout! I felt that Bob went beyond what is reasonable for an averagely fit person to do, even his extremely fit crew can hardly finish some of the moves. But that's exactly what I was looking for after having mastered JM's DVDs, something that would challenge me and bring me to the next level. It is possible to reduce the burn by using lighter weights and in fact I switched from 8 lbs to 6 lbs halfway through the workout so I could finish it. I also did the push up - T-stand exercise without weights the second time around.I give the DVD 4 stars instead of 5 because the workout is too long at 66 min. I work 8-5 and I come home, start dinner and then put in some exercise before dinner. Sometimes I have the energy to do a longer 45 min workout, sometimes I do a 20 min 30 day shred, but I NEVER have the energy to go on for 66 min. So I can only do this workout once a week during the weekend.

That being said, it was not easy (even with my modifications).My biggest problem is that I would consider myself an intermediate when it comes to a fitness/workout level and I found the shorter workout to be too easy, and the longer workout to be almost too difficult.  I really wish this DVD would have had 3 workouts (the 25 min, one about 40 mins, and then the 60+ min one).  I think that would be much easier for people who aren't quite at the level of the 60 min workout but are beyond the 25 minute one.  It seems like quite a jump for someone just starting out to go from the 25 min directly to the 60, but maybe that is just my thought process.I love the countdown clock and found that to be one of the best parts of this DVD.  You always know where you are, but don't get too excited when you hit the 15 minute mark because that's about where you will really have to work.  I found the last section before the cool down/stretch to be the hardest part of the entire thing, and it has nothing to do with my wrist issues.  It's just tough.As others have said, there isn't really a focus on ab work, but there is a focus on keeping your abs tight throughout and there are a couple balance exercises that require you to keep them tight as well.There are a lot of hold moves too.  You go through the exercises and then at the end Bob has you hold the position.  That gets a little tiring but it is, for the most part, manageable.One of the things I really like is that no one is really in sync.  They are all working out at various fitness levels and at various speeds which makes you feel good about where you are and what you're doing.  There is the occasional push to do something faster, but, again, it really is a work at your own pace DVD and as long as you're pushing yourself then you're doing it right.  There are no happy, peppy people in this thing and at times all three of the people working out look like they're going to die.I'm giving it 4 because I had to make too many modifications for my wrists, but it did kick my butt and if it wasn't for my own personal inability to do some of the exercises, I would have given it a 5.",4,"Very tough, but very good",1283040000,"08 29, 2010",2010,2306,"[""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'wrist', 'problems', 'were', 'lot', 'exercises', 'video', 'was', 'either', 'unable', 'do', 'had', 'be', 'modified', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'even', 'modifications', '.My', 'biggest', 'problem', 'would', 'consider', 'intermediate', 'when', 'fitness/workout', 'level', 'found', 'shorter', 'workout', 'be', 'too', 'easy', 'longer', 'workout', 'be', 'almost', 'too', 'difficult', 'really', 'wish', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'had', '3', 'workouts', '25', 'min', 'one', '40', 'mins', 'then', '60+', 'min', 'one', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'easier', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'level', '60', 'min', 'workout', 'are', '25', 'minute', 'one', 'quite', 'jump', 'someone', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'go', '25', 'min', 'directly', '60', 'maybe', 'just', 'thought', 'process.I', 'countdown', 'clock', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'parts', 'DVD', 'always', 'know', 'where', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'excited', 'when', 'hit', '15', 'minute', 'mark', 'where', 'will', 'really', 'have', 'work', 'found', 'last', 'section', 'cool', 'down/stretch', 'be', 'hardest', 'part', 'entire', 'thing', 'nothing', 'do', 'wrist', 'issues', 'just', 'tough.As', 'others', 'have', 'said', ""n't"", 'really', 'focus', 'ab', 'work', 'focus', 'keeping', 'abs', 'tight', 'are', 'couple', 'balance', 'exercises', 'require', 'keep', 'tight', 'are', 'lot', 'hold', 'moves', 'too', 'go', 'exercises', 'then', 'end', 'Bob', 'hold', 'position', 'little', 'tiring', 'most', 'part', 'manageable.One', 'things', 'really', 'like', 'one', 'really', 'sync', 'are', 'working', 'out', 'various', 'fitness', 'levels', 'various', 'speeds', 'feel', 'good', 'where', 'are', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'occasional', 'push', 'do', 'something', 'faster', 'again', 'really', 'work', 'own', 'pace', 'DVD', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'pushing', 'then', ""'re"", 'doing', 'right', 'are', 'happy', 'peppy', 'people', 'thing', 'times', 'three', 'people', 'working', 'out', 'look', ""'re"", 'going', 'die.I', ""'m"", 'giving', '4', 'had', 'make', 'too', 'many', 'modifications', 'wrists', 'did', 'kick', 'butt', 'was', ""n't"", 'own', 'personal', 'inability', 'do', 'exercises', 'would', 'have', 'given', '5']",Bh: Pure Burn Super Strength

Having made it big with the Biggest Loser, Bob has branched out into his own line of products and work out videos.  His dispostion seems softer than Jillian's, he has the the better methods of motivation as well as more reasonable exercises for one to do (even though I like Jillian just as much, apples and oranges).  There are two workouts on this DVD, the beginning and the advanced.  The only bit of criticism is that there doesn't seem to be an intermediate step.  The beginning has its challenges, but only lasts 20 minutes.  The advanced is 60 minutes and brutal, which will leave you weak and begging for mercy at the end of it.  Perhaps there should be an intermediate workout between them to blend both.  However, Bob will make you strong.  DON'T GIVE UP, you CAN get through his routine and then you WILL loose weight IF YOU PUT THAT NEVER ENDING EFFORT INTO IT.

Bob kicks a**!! I love Pure Burn Super Strength! Definately not for the faint of heart. This has to be one of the best strength workout dvds ever - IMO.  There are two workouts:Workout 1 - One hour full-out (a little over an hour including warm up & cool down)Workout 2 - 20 min. beginner workoutYou need weights. I used 3lbs & 5lbs, however, will use 8 lbs next workout. Obviously, men will use heavier weights to start out with. Bob says up to 12 lbs...but for guys, I would think higher. If you have hard floors, you'll also need a mat.BREAKDOWN - WORKOUT 1WarmupSquats with weightsPushupsBicep curl to shoulder pressSquats w/ weights - increase speed, then hold...BURNS!Down & Outs - add push upPushups then go halfway down - holdBicep curl w/ shoulder pressDown & Outs - pushupsFast Shoulder presses then hold....Back Rows - then pulsesDeadliftsRight leg in front - bent over rowsArm Raise Combo - Front, Side, and Posterier pinky up sideHold arms out to side - 3xLeft leg in front - bent over rowsArm Raise ComboWATER BREAK!!

OUCH.Continue in squat position, put arms down...hold, then weighted jump squats, finish the burn with more weighted chair squat!Tricep ExtensionsFloor - Skull Crushers, Chest Press, Crunches w/ legs extendedRoll over to Plank position for Weighted Plank RowsWeighted T-Stands - pushup w/ T-stand, T-stand each side, then pushups w/ T-stand again - Seriously HurtingHold Plank PositionStand up begin Matrix LungesMatrix Lunges (holding one weight) - lunge forward, lunge side, lunge back (pay attention to the back lunge, form is unique)Standing Weighted PulloversMatrix Lunges on other legIso Arms - hold arm straight out, then arm out to side palm down, front, side...repeat iso arm other sideWATER BREAKOn floor in plank position on forearms.

(Thankfully, I checked it out from my local library instead of purchasing it based on the DVD jacket.) It was alright, but rather dull. It is very traditional in that he works out with model-perfect people who are way too serious and expressionless. Beyond those superficial complaints, the workout is just dull. He works one muscle group at a time,and it just seems to move rather slowly. The thing I like about the BL DVD's is that he combines upper and lower body together, which makes it much more challenging; plus Bob seems more approachable and motivating than he is in this one. That's not to say that I felt no burn, because I did. But only a fraction of the burn I get from the 2 BL workouts mentioned.

For lower body it's a few lunges with weights -- you can add the plyo move to make it more challenging.  There are also some matrix lunges and there are squats of course but really that's about it for legs.

For those of you who look forward to the end he goes right on past the 60 min time frame and even makes it harder at the end.",5,Easy never does it!,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,900,"['was', 'looking', 'different', 'challenging', 'work', 'out', 'workout', '6', 'times', 'week', 'so', 'when', 'saw', 'thought', 'oh', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'easy', 'guess', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'easy', 'never', 'workout', 'so', 'sick', 'people', 'working', 'out', 'video', 'are', 'dying', 'are', 'looking', 'cardio', 'strength', 'challenging', 'workout', 'My', 'only', 'peeve', 'Bob', 'shouting', 'out', 'commands', 'commander', 'Navy', 'seal', 'bootcamp', 'training', 'even', 'only', 'guy', 'saying', 'keep', 'up', 'girls', 'notice', 'hardly', 'doing', 'exercises', 'when', 'finally', 'do', 'counting', 'much', 'more', 'accurate', 'notice', 'when', 'not', 'doing', 'count', 'down', 'much', 'longer', 'Also', '65mins', 'long', 'who', 'look', 'forward', 'end', 'right', '60', 'min', 'time', 'frame', 'even', 'harder', 'end']",Bh: Pure Burn Super Strength

My fitness has fallen dramatically after a couple of years of dealing with life's crisis, I had unconsciously packed on more calories and now I am doing it something about it.  I have started with Jillian Michael and I wanted more variety with calories burn without all the jumping around as I live in an apt. So this DVD was absolutely perfect: challenging moves that gets you sweating within 5minutes.  Yeah you will feel your muscles burn, but since I am slightly unfit, I felt okay to catch my breathe in some of the moves.. As long as I keep moving, keep going.  my goal is to be able to keep up and in the meantime, i do my best,  it was great that there were modifications and that two of three people demonstrating were not that fit, so it was reassuring to go down this journey together.  I did not feel inadequate!  I actually ended up doing 45 minutes of the exercises on first try and that surprised me given the macho comments on the various reviews!  So ladies if you have been working up to L2 with jillian Michaels' various shred it DVDs, then you certainly give this DVD a good stab.

I'm in good shape and workout 6 days a week (running, step aerobics, pilates, yoga, weight training, etc) and I thought it was just OK.  I found myself really annoyed that the three supporting exercisers were gasping for air and resting every time Bob turned around!  How is that motivating for those of us doing the workout at home??  As far as the host, I like Bob's attitude and found him easy to watch on tv.  He doesn't do a lot of the workout, but that's fine because he's showing you the moves on the supporting cast.The workout itself took the low weight/high rep approach.  In my opinion, there was too much shoulder work. By the end of the 60 minute workout I could barely hold myself up in plank, which made it hard to do push-ups.  Don't get me wrong, the fatigue is good, but my chest workout suffered.

1366271,A1T6VABQU7RBMA,B003ULW71Q,T. Carr,"[5, 5]","I wish I could give this 4.5 stars. It's one of the best weight training strength and endurance dvds I've tried but a couple of things hold me back from giving it the full 5 stars.This dvd includes a 20 min. beginner workout and a 67 min. advanced workout. I started with the beginner and it is definitely for beginners. Very basic and not at all scary, but nice when you don't want something as intense or long. As for the longer workout, it is difficult. I typically like to challenge myself with heavier weights, always thinking back to the fact that most people don't lift enough to get any benefit. However, there's no way I'd be able to get through the entire hour with anything more than 3 lb. weights. (I have fairly weak arms, but still typically use 5 or 8 lb. weights with workout dvds.) This is as much an endurance workout as it is for strength. Bob keeps you moving the entire time... multiple reps, multiple sets and lots on one leg/arm before switching sides. The multiple sets of the exact same move got somewhat boring and repetitive at times. It would have been nice to work the same muscles but with a slight variation in movement to keep it interesting. He gives some modifications to make moves easier or harder throughout though not for every move. There are 3 people demonstrating with him and 1 typically does the advanced, 1 the normal and 1 the basic variation. I have to cut down on the number of reps for certain moves, as they are too strenuous for me... even with my light weights. I like that it gives me something to work toward though.The entire hour is definitely weight training based. There isn't as much fusion with cardio moves as some other trainers provide, so whether or not this is for you depends on what you're looking for. If you want pure weight training, this is it. It still definitely brings your heart rate up and gets you sweating. The focus is on arms/shoulders, legs and abs. I like that the bottom of the screen shows a countdown timer along with a little bar of sorts that keeps inching toward the finish line so you see a visual for how much you've accomplished and how much you have left.I like Bob's personality but don't think he's for everyone; he definitely gives me the push I need. I don't watch Biggest Loser but I've heard from others he's much ""meaner"" in this dvd than he is on the show. He frequently claps out a beat, yelling for you to pick up the pace and never stop, to do all of the reps. He's intense but I also find him encouraging.Besides the repetitive sets my only other complaint is with the background demonstrators and some of the videography. Throughout the dvd the 3 demonstrators, and one woman especially, have these horrible, exaggerated pained expressions on their faces as if this is the hardest thing they've ever done and it's often accompanied with grunting and awful noises to let us know how much pain they're in. It's really exaggerated and annoying. I almost feel like a director assigned them certain workout personalities to try and act out... one woman is ""the athlete"" who pushes to the extreme with little complaint and can execute things fairly easily and with lots of focus. The other woman is ""the determined beginner""; she never stops but lets us know how hard it is for her by grunting and making faces. And the guy is the ""I need to rest"" type who wants to keep taking breaks but Bob always catches him and tells him not to stop. If it weren't for this, this workout would be nearly perfect for strength training and endurance purposes. Also, the videography can get slightly annoying at times... zooming in and pausing for a second, almost creating a snapshot of the exercise, with a different color screen.However, if you're looking for a workout dvd that's strength training focused and will push and challenge you, this is it. I reach for it more often than any of my other workout dvds when I want to focus purely on weight training.",4,Tough but effective,1311120000,"07 20, 2011",2011,3945,"['wish', 'could', 'give', '4.5', 'stars', 'one', 'best', 'weight', 'training', 'strength', 'endurance', 'dvds', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'couple', 'things', 'hold', 'back', 'giving', 'full', '5', 'stars.This', 'dvd', '20', 'min', 'beginner', 'workout', '67', 'min', 'advanced', 'started', 'beginner', 'definitely', 'beginners', 'Very', 'basic', 'not', 'scary', 'nice', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'something', 'intense', 'long', 'longer', 'workout', 'difficult', 'typically', 'challenge', 'heavier', 'weights', 'always', 'thinking', 'back', 'fact', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'lift', 'enough', 'get', 'benefit', 'However', 'way', ""'d"", 'be', 'able', 'get', 'entire', 'hour', 'anything', 'more', '3', 'lb', 'weights', 'have', 'fairly', 'weak', 'arms', 'still', 'typically', 'use', '5', '8', 'lb', 'weights', 'workout', 'dvds', 'as', 'much', 'endurance', 'workout', 'strength', 'Bob', 'moving', 'entire', 'time', 'multiple', 'reps', 'multiple', 'sets', 'lots', 'one', 'leg/arm', 'switching', 'sides', 'multiple', 'sets', 'exact', 'same', 'move', 'got', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'repetitive', 'times', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'work', 'same', 'muscles', 'slight', 'variation', 'movement', 'keep', 'interesting', 'modifications', 'make', 'moves', 'easier', 'harder', 'not', 'move', 'are', '3', 'people', 'demonstrating', '1', 'typically', 'advanced', '1', 'normal', '1', 'basic', 'variation', 'have', 'cut', 'down', 'number', 'reps', 'certain', 'moves', 'are', 'too', 'strenuous', 'even', 'light', 'weights', 'something', 'work', 'though.The', 'entire', 'hour', 'definitely', 'weight', 'training', 'based', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'fusion', 'cardio', 'moves', 'other', 'trainers', 'provide', 'so', 'not', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'want', 'pure', 'weight', 'training', 'still', 'definitely', 'heart', 'rate', 'sweating', 'focus', 'arms/shoulders', 'legs', 'abs', 'like', 'bottom', 'screen', 'countdown', 'timer', 'little', 'bar', 'sorts', 'keeps', 'inching', 'finish', 'line', 'see', 'visual', 'how', 'much', ""'ve"", 'accomplished', 'how', 'much', 'have', 'left.I', 'Bob', 'personality', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'everyone', 'definitely', 'push', 'need', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Biggest', 'Loser', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'others', 'much', 'meaner', 'dvd', 'show', 'frequently', 'out', 'beat', 'yelling', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'never', 'stop', 'do', 'reps', 'intense', 'also', 'find', 'repetitive', 'sets', 'only', 'other', 'complaint', 'background', 'demonstrators', 'videography', 'dvd', '3', 'demonstrators', 'one', 'woman', 'especially', 'have', 'horrible', 'exaggerated', 'pained', 'expressions', 'hardest', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'done', 'often', 'accompanied', 'grunting', 'awful', 'noises', 'let', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'pain', ""'re"", 'really', 'exaggerated', 'annoying', 'almost', 'feel', 'director', 'assigned', 'certain', 'workout', 'personalities', 'try', 'act', 'out', 'one', 'woman', 'athlete', 'who', 'extreme', 'little', 'complaint', 'can', 'execute', 'things', 'fairly', 'easily', 'lots', 'focus', 'other', 'woman', 'determined', 'beginner', 'never', 'stops', 'know', 'how', 'hard', 'grunting', 'making', 'guy', 'need', 'rest', 'type', 'who', 'keep', 'taking', 'breaks', 'Bob', 'always', 'tells', 'not', 'stop', 'were', ""n't"", 'workout', 'would', 'be', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'strength', 'training', 'endurance', 'purposes', 'Also', 'videography', 'can', 'get', 'slightly', 'annoying', 'times', 'zooming', 'pausing', 'second', 'almost', 'creating', 'snapshot', 'exercise', 'different', 'color', 'screen.However', ""'re"", 'looking', 'workout', 'dvd', 'strength', 'training', 'focused', 'will', 'push', 'challenge', 'reach', 'more', 'often', 'other', 'workout', 'dvds', 'when', 'want', 'focus', 'purely', 'weight', 'training']",Bh: Pure Burn Super Strength

But it was a nice change of pace. Since I'm not familiar with Bob's training style I can't comment on that but I enjoyed the combination use of body weight style training and light weights.My interest in fitness sort of ebbs and flows and I needed a change from heavy weight training. This does the trick.I was sort of annoyed with one move though, the push ups into the side T with weights (can't remember what he called them sorry). But I don't like doing push ups off of weights because after awhile my hands start to hurt so I had to move quickly through so that I could drop my pushing hand down to the floor to avoid that pain.
