More is on his plate, as well; a mother (Camryn Manheim) arrives in town, begging for his aid in finding her long-missing child, and his ex-wife informs him she plans to move in with her new boyfriend. Needless to say, Stone is finding solace in the bottle, and verbally sparring with his shrink (William Devane)...but he doggedly searches for answers, despite the threats and suspicion.The series 'regulars' (Kathy Baker and Kohl Sudduth, as Stone's fellow Paradise cops, and William Sadler, as a Boston mobster) are wonderful, as is Leslie Hope, portraying an IA investigator attracted to him...and Joe the Dog (as his mutt, Reggie), shines, as always (the canine is a hell of an actor!).

Healy takes several bullets and Jesse is shot in his upper arm.  Jesse leaves Healy at the hospital and makes an early appointment with his psychiatrist Dr. Dix (William Devane). Dr. Dix recognizes that Jesse is not using a sling for his arm and ultimately is not taking care of himself.  Back to his office he interacts with Deputy Rose Gammon (Kathy Baker) and Suitcase (Kohl Sudduth).  There he is barked at about inconsequential items.  The town council has requested Jesse's immediate appearance.  He is now in trouble because they think he was working a side job in Boston.  Additionally, they do not like Jesse's name along next to Paradise regarding the shoot out.  Councilman Carter Hansen told Jesse, ""We can fire you.""  Jesse's retorted, ""I see it as my job not to look the other way.""  Here we go - - - Jesse is on THIN ICE.  Regardless he intends to find who shot his friend Healy as well as himself.  In the mean time, Elizabeth Blue (Camryn Manheim) from Albuquerque NM ends up in Jesse's office.  She believes her son was stolen from her seven years ago and that he now lives in Paradise based on a letter she received, ""Your Child is Loved.""  Rose takes the case and she researches the evidence.  The story of Healy's attempted murder and Elizabeth Blue's child carries throughout the 90 minute show.  We are thrust into the movie by the many Jesse Stone characters such as Gino Fish (William Sadler), Dr. Perkins (John Beale) and of course Reggie (Joe) Jesse's dog.  Jesse asked for help from the Internal Affairs Officer.  Her response is, ""If you (Jesse) cross the line, I will put your away.""

And the review that pans it for cliche's ought to hang around a police dept. for a while, there are only a few non-abrasive answers a peace officer can give to adversarial remarks or stupid questions from reporters or gawkers.Selleck's understated manner is, in my opinion, his interpretation of how an ex-L.A. cop kicked off the force for drinking, and now in his last chance job would play it.  You do your job, don't show favoritism and adopt a manner that small town people will understand.  L.A. Police work is probably a lot different than Paradise Cove police work so insert yourself, as the actor must do into the difference he has to deal with, his problem of drinking and the impermanence of any female relationship beyond that of his symbiotic connection with his ex-wife are problems Selleck has to portray and he does so very well, again with out a lot Pacino histrionics.  My advice, Jesse just hang up the f-ing phone, and erase the messages without repeatedly listening to them.All this Selleck and his writers and director draw us into.

Add an Internal Affairs investigation conducted by an angst-ridden and glamorous officer to the mix (Jesse managed to fire a couple of shots at the gunman) and this is a satisfying addition to the series.Thin Ice describes more than the story.

While there is still the wonderful repartee among the members of Paradise's tiny PD that is so characteristic of these stories, everyone seems uneasy and Jesse seems more self-destructive than in the past.

Who'd a thunk that Tom Selleck could really steal the show?  He is the antithesis of what I would think of as a Parker man. But, oh, how wrong I was.Selleck or Jesse as he likes to be known, has come to Paradise, Massachusetts after a tough time in California. He comes to this small town and becomes their sheriff. Paradise, as it turns out, is a place that attracts crime. This time a mother comes looking for her missing son. He was born seven years ago and taken the day of his birth. She is sure he is still alive, and someone sent her a note saying 'your son is loved'. Jesse is not keen on taking up this case but one of his staff, played by Kathy Baker, takes it on, on her own time. The town fathers are not happy with Jesse, not enough speeding tickets, so his job is on the line. He is helping a fellow cop, chief of the state's homicide bureau, when both are shot. This is another mystery to undertake. But, it seems Jesse is up to all challenges, and he meets them head on.A lot of humor, some implied sex, danger, and the city of Boston is featured.

This time around, Stone is visiting his pal, State Homicide Commander Healy [Stephen McHattie] and whilst on a sort of stakeout, both are shot. Stone later investigates whilst Healy recuperates in hospital, and finds that the shooting and the stakeout are not connected. As is typical in the Jesse Stone series, there is more than one story arc. Stone returns to Paradise to find his position as Police Chief threatened by a town councilman.My favorite in the series is Stone Cold, but the other stories are just as engaging, and what elevates this series from the average made-for-TV movie is the intelligent writing, beautiful cinematography and of course, Tom Selleck's charismatic portrayal of the tormented Police Chief. Recommended to fans of Selleck, mysteries, and police procedurals.",5,A highly-addictive series!,1245628800,"06 22, 2009",2009,938,"['installment', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'series', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'role', 'multi-faceted', 'Police', 'Chief', 'small', 'town', 'Paradise', 'MA', 'time', 'around', 'Stone', 'visiting', 'pal', 'State', 'Homicide', 'Commander', 'Healy', '[', 'Stephen', 'McHattie', ']', 'whilst', 'sort', 'stakeout', 'are', 'shot', 'Stone', 'later', 'whilst', 'Healy', 'recuperates', 'hospital', 'shooting', 'stakeout', 'are', 'not', 'connected', 'typical', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'series', 'more', 'one', 'story', 'arc', 'Stone', 'Paradise', 'find', 'position', 'Police', 'Chief', 'threatened', 'town', 'councilman.My', 'favorite', 'series', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'other', 'stories', 'are', 'just', 'engaging', 'what', 'series', 'average', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'intelligent', 'writing', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'course', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'charismatic', 'portrayal', 'tormented', 'Police', 'Chief', 'Recommended', 'fans', 'Selleck', 'mysteries', 'police', 'procedurals']",Jesse Stone: Thin Ice
