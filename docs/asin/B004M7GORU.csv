The emotion he shows in the film is amazing. A real roler coaster from sad, to distraugh to angrey, to worry, to happy. The sex sceens were racey, I loved them , more skin from David. The story line was sad and later hopeful and then happy. The Kids were great in this , but David Tennant was definetly the supream star( he is) in this. This is the best acting by David Tennant and that is saying something with all the great acting he has done in other movies and tv.",5,"Great,Great,Tennant was 10 stars.",1362614400,"03 7, 2013",2013,564,"['movie', 'was', 'great', 'great', 'David', 'Tennant', 'was', '10', 'stars', 'thing', 'expected', 'more', 'emotion', 'film', 'amazing', 'real', 'roler', 'coaster', 'sad', 'distraugh', 'angrey', 'worry', 'happy', 'sex', 'sceens', 'were', 'racey', 'loved', 'more', 'skin', 'David', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'sad', 'later', 'hopeful', 'then', 'happy', 'Kids', 'were', 'great', 'David', 'Tennant', 'was', 'definetly', 'supream', 'star', 'best', 'acting', 'David', 'Tennant', 'saying', 'something', 'great', 'acting', 'done', 'other', 'movies', 'tv']",N/A

Roesly,"[1, 2]","First, I was worried I'd never be able to watch a Region 2 DVD, but the seller (Factory Distributor) answered my email immediately and assured me it would work on my computer.  It worked perfectly.Everyone in this four-part drama did an exceptional job acting.  David Tennant was superb.  The story was done in good taste and with a sense of reality not seen in most movies.  It showed the raw agony of losing a spouse/mother/friend and the ensuing turmoil that the surviving spouse must deal with, but did so without relying on melodrama or overacting to engage the audience.  The tight storyline and excellent acting made it impossible to only watch one episode at a time and was well worth a second viewing the very next day.  This is a very emotionally charged series, so have tissues handy!",5,Top Notch Acting,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,795,"['First', 'was', 'worried', ""'d"", 'never', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'Region', '2', 'DVD', 'seller', 'Factory', 'Distributor', 'answered', 'email', 'immediately', 'assured', 'would', 'work', 'computer', 'worked', 'perfectly.Everyone', 'four-part', 'drama', 'did', 'exceptional', 'job', 'acting', 'David', 'Tennant', 'was', 'superb', 'story', 'was', 'done', 'good', 'taste', 'sense', 'reality', 'not', 'seen', 'most', 'movies', 'showed', 'raw', 'agony', 'losing', 'spouse/mother/friend', 'ensuing', 'turmoil', 'surviving', 'spouse', 'must', 'deal', 'did', 'so', 'relying', 'melodrama', 'overacting', 'engage', 'audience', 'tight', 'storyline', 'excellent', 'acting', 'made', 'impossible', 'only', 'watch', 'one', 'episode', 'time', 'was', 'well', 'second', 'viewing', 'very', 'next', 'day', 'very', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'series', 'so', 'have', 'tissues', 'handy']",N/A

His wonderful performances in those roles made me want to see more. His performance in this just blew me away. Actually, all the performances in this are phenomenal. They're so authentic that watching this feels more like dropping in on real lives than watching a scripted drama. Single Father beautifully captures the complexities of modern blended families and made me laugh at some points and brought me to tears at others. I've watched it several times and still love it.Technical note: These are discs meant for the European market. You'll need a multi-region DVD player to watch them. I bought one through Amazon and I'm very glad I did.",5,Fabulous miniseries,1353110400,"11 17, 2012",2012,734,"['was', 'familiar', 'David', 'Tennant', 'work', 'Doctor', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Hamlet', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'roles', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'performance', 'just', 'blew', 'away', 'Actually', 'performances', 'are', 'phenomenal', ""'re"", 'so', 'authentic', 'watching', 'more', 'dropping', 'real', 'lives', 'watching', 'scripted', 'drama', 'Single', 'Father', 'beautifully', 'complexities', 'modern', 'blended', 'families', 'made', 'laugh', 'points', 'brought', 'tears', 'others', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'still', 'love', 'it.Technical', 'note', 'are', 'discs', 'meant', 'European', 'market', ""'ll"", 'need', 'multi-region', 'DVD', 'player', 'watch', 'bought', 'one', 'Amazon', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'did']",N/A
