815960,A1K336IW5K1N2Y,B0001XAKFG,D. Johnson,"[1, 1]","This movie has similarities to the 1987 thriller, ""Fatal Attraction"", starring Glenn Close and Michael Douglas, in that the husband has an affair with a psycho, who's name is also Alex, just like Glenn Close's character. Once the cheating husband finds out who he's dealing with, he's in too deep.  The similarities stop there because this one has a lot more guessing games as to whodunnit and the ending is a straight up shocker.  I thought Steve White and Debra Wilson gave stand out performances.  They played their roles like I've never seen them play before.
