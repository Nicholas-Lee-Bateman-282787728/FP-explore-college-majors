282296,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6301971426,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[82, 86]","Charles Bronson (1921-2003) left us a legacy that spanned nearly five decades of acting, in many different styles. Though good at comedy as well as drama, he will mostly be remembered as a tough and gritty man of action, remaining very macho and attractive way into his gnarled, craggy later years, never losing that perspicacious glint in his eyes, or his masculine appeal.&quot;The Mechanic&quot; is one of his best; a unique film with a taut script by John Lewis Carlino, that remains interesting after many years and many viewings.The first memorable 15 minutes of this film are silent except for the tense, eerie score by Jerry Fielding, and set up the character of Arthur Bishop, who is a hit man with expensive tastes and a heart of steel. It is a part that fits Bronson like a velvet glove, with its complexity, bravado, and action sequences, which are well paced by director Winner, and photographed by Richard Kline. Jan-Michael Vincent is excellent as the cocky, cold-as-ice young man Bishop takes on to teach his &quot;trade&quot;, and Jill Ireland (who was married to Bronson for many years) does well in a miniscule part.Michael Winner made several films with Bronson, another favorite being &quot;Chato's Land&quot;, which is an unusual, and very special Western.The intricacy of the plot will keep you guessing; this is not your typical, predictable action movie, and like most films made in the '70s, it is fun to watch, with its nifty fashions and slightly tacky d&eacute;cor.A must see for those that like intelligent thrillers, and a great film to celebrate Charles Bronson's life and talent",5,the great Charles Bronson,1062374400,"09 1, 2003",2003,1611,"['Charles', 'Bronson', '1921-2003', 'left', 'legacy', 'spanned', 'nearly', 'five', 'decades', 'acting', 'many', 'different', 'styles', 'good', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'drama', 'will', 'mostly', 'be', 'remembered', 'tough', 'gritty', 'man', 'action', 'remaining', 'very', 'macho', 'attractive', 'way', 'gnarled', 'craggy', 'later', 'years', 'never', 'losing', 'perspicacious', 'glint', 'eyes', 'masculine', 'appeal.', 'quot', 'Mechanic', 'quot', 'one', 'best', 'unique', 'film', 'taut', 'script', 'John', 'Lewis', 'Carlino', 'interesting', 'many', 'years', 'many', 'viewings.The', 'first', 'memorable', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'silent', 'tense', 'eerie', 'score', 'Jerry', 'Fielding', 'set', 'up', 'character', 'Arthur', 'Bishop', 'who', 'hit', 'man', 'expensive', 'tastes', 'heart', 'steel', 'part', 'Bronson', 'velvet', 'glove', 'complexity', 'bravado', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'well', 'paced', 'director', 'Winner', 'photographed', 'Richard', 'Kline', 'Jan-Michael', 'Vincent', 'excellent', 'cocky', 'cold-as-ice', 'young', 'man', 'Bishop', 'teach', 'quot', 'trade', 'quot', 'Jill', 'Ireland', 'who', 'was', 'married', 'Bronson', 'many', 'years', 'well', 'miniscule', 'part.Michael', 'Winner', 'made', 'several', 'films', 'Bronson', 'favorite', 'being', 'quot', 'Chato', 'Land', 'quot', 'unusual', 'very', 'special', 'Western.The', 'intricacy', 'plot', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'not', 'typical', 'predictable', 'action', 'movie', 'most', 'films', 'made', ""'70s"", 'fun', 'watch', 'nifty', 'fashions', 'slightly', 'tacky', 'd', 'eacute', 'cor.A', 'must', 'see', 'like', 'intelligent', 'thrillers', 'great', 'film', 'celebrate', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'life', 'talent']",N/A

282299,AO37T54VEP0JQ,6301971426,"B.C. Scribe ""trekviewer""","[46, 51]","This film along with 'Mr. Majestyk' and 'Death Wish' represent Charles Bronson's early 70's classic movie trifecta.  Though he created many memorable characters in a variety of films I believe his cinematic identity can be traced back directly to this trio.  In each of them he creates an indelible character as only he could do - each film is uniquely Bronson, they belong to him and him alone.What this film has as its strength is it's central character, Arthur Bishop, who we watch with great interest.  Bishop is a cultured, mannered, well-educated man; he has an appreciation for the arts and lives a solitary, isolated existence in a luxurious and extravagantly furnished house.  Seeing him alone in this spacious dwelling influences us that he desperately needs someone - anyone - to make a positive connection with. A little later in the film he will pay a call girl to portray a mistress who has been pining away for him.  Still later he sits idly by while a young woman commits suicide, coldly relating to her the statistical facts about her particular method of attempted suicide.  Bishop is the son of a deceased criminal kingpin who continues to associate with his father's former cronies.  He forms a bond with the son of one of them and that is what forms the crux of the story.  The excellent screenplay concentrates more on character study than supplying a liberal amount of action sequences that typically augment so many movies of this genre - and this decision helps raise it to a higher level.Though the movie is relatively low-key for the most part there are the requisite action scenes that mark a typical Bronson film.  Undoubtedly, the opening of  'The Mechanic' is among the most memorable introductory sequences for a film of the action genre.  The first fifteen minutes of the film centers around the elimination of a drug dealer.  Bronson studies his quarry with great precision, evocative of the style used in the popular television series 'Mission Impossible'.  There is not a word of dialogue spoken; only background noises or incidental pieces of conversations on the street are present.  There is an exciting motorcycle chase as well, punctuated with bits of humor; a car chase in Naples, punctuated by a gunfight, is also one of the highlights.  But what makes `The Mechanic' a cult film favorite is the incredible double-twist ending that you don't see coming - and it makes for one of the most satisfying conclusions in film history.Other interesting features in `The Mechanic' include the ""The Organization"" that Bronson works for - it remains tantalizingly undefined.  The people of the ""contracts"" that he fulfills are all criminal in nature and therefore they don't generate our sympathy.  Except for the three pivotal role players no one else has a given name.  This is done to underscore the detached and emotionless shells that such ""mechanics"" would naturally maintain.  As the film progresses we get the impression that Bishop is going to ""get out of the business"" or somehow find his way out and settle for a sedate and stress less existence.  Instead he becomes as vulnerable as the victims he has been preying on...or does he?  Did he really fall into the trap set for him or did he allow himself to because he was convinced he couldn't escape?  The screenplay doesn't answer that question definitively but it doesn't hurt the overall impact - it isn't over yet as we soon learn!If you are watching `The Mechanic' for the first time I envy you.  If you are watching it for the first time in quite awhile you will be impressed all over again.  Or you may be like me; unable to remember the number of times you have watched it but still can't wait to watch it again.Some final notes: The dated elements of this movie stand out rather sorely.  Steve's house party complete with hippies and their brand of music and vernacular was already an anachronism when `The Mechanic' was made.  The interior of the call girl's apartment is also hopelessly early 70's.  The karate exhibition that Arthur and Steve attend is laughable as well.  Before the exhibition begins Arthur tells Steve ""the two masters won't actually hit each other because it would most certainly result in death.""  Regardless this fight sequence is poorly choreographed and is entirely unconvincing.",3,The first film in Bronson's classic movie trifecta,1038009600,"11 23, 2002",2002,4308,"['film', ""'Mr"", 'Majestyk', 'Wish', 'represent', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'early', '70', 'classic', 'movie', 'trifecta', 'created', 'many', 'memorable', 'characters', 'variety', 'films', 'believe', 'cinematic', 'identity', 'can', 'be', 'traced', 'back', 'directly', 'trio', 'indelible', 'character', 'only', 'could', 'do', 'film', 'uniquely', 'Bronson', 'belong', 'alone.What', 'film', 'strength', 'central', 'character', 'Arthur', 'Bishop', 'who', 'watch', 'great', 'interest', 'Bishop', 'cultured', 'mannered', 'well-educated', 'man', 'appreciation', 'arts', 'solitary', 'isolated', 'existence', 'luxurious', 'extravagantly', 'furnished', 'house', 'Seeing', 'alone', 'spacious', 'dwelling', 'influences', 'desperately', 'someone', 'anyone', 'make', 'positive', 'connection', 'little', 'later', 'film', 'will', 'pay', 'call', 'girl', 'portray', 'mistress', 'who', 'been', 'pining', 'away', 'Still', 'later', 'idly', 'young', 'woman', 'commits', 'suicide', 'coldly', 'relating', 'statistical', 'facts', 'particular', 'method', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'Bishop', 'son', 'deceased', 'criminal', 'kingpin', 'who', 'associate', 'father', 'former', 'cronies', 'bond', 'son', 'one', 'what', 'crux', 'story', 'excellent', 'screenplay', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'supplying', 'liberal', 'amount', 'action', 'sequences', 'typically', 'augment', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'genre', 'decision', 'raise', 'higher', 'movie', 'relatively', 'low-key', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'requisite', 'action', 'scenes', 'mark', 'typical', 'Bronson', 'film', 'Undoubtedly', 'opening', ""'The"", 'Mechanic', 'most', 'memorable', 'introductory', 'sequences', 'film', 'action', 'genre', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film', 'centers', 'elimination', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Bronson', 'studies', 'quarry', 'great', 'precision', 'evocative', 'style', 'used', 'popular', 'television', 'series', ""'Mission"", 'Impossible', 'not', 'word', 'dialogue', 'spoken', 'only', 'background', 'noises', 'incidental', 'pieces', 'conversations', 'street', 'are', 'present', 'exciting', 'motorcycle', 'chase', 'as', 'well', 'punctuated', 'bits', 'humor', 'car', 'chase', 'Naples', 'punctuated', 'gunfight', 'also', 'one', 'highlights', 'what', 'Mechanic', 'cult', 'film', 'favorite', 'incredible', 'double-twist', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'one', 'most', 'satisfying', 'conclusions', 'film', 'history.Other', 'interesting', 'features', 'Mechanic', 'include', 'Organization', 'Bronson', 'tantalizingly', 'undefined', 'people', 'contracts', 'are', 'criminal', 'nature', 'therefore', 'do', ""n't"", 'generate', 'sympathy', 'three', 'pivotal', 'role', 'players', 'one', 'else', 'given', 'name', 'done', 'underscore', 'detached', 'emotionless', 'shells', 'such', 'mechanics', 'would', 'naturally', 'maintain', 'film', 'get', 'impression', 'Bishop', 'going', 'get', 'business', 'somehow', 'find', 'way', 'settle', 'sedate', 'stress', 'less', 'existence', 'Instead', 'as', 'vulnerable', 'victims', 'been', 'preying', 'Did', 'really', 'fall', 'trap', 'set', 'did', 'allow', 'was', 'convinced', 'could', ""n't"", 'escape', 'screenplay', ""n't"", 'answer', 'question', 'definitively', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'overall', 'impact', ""n't"", 'over', 'yet', 'soon', 'learn', 'are', 'watching', 'Mechanic', 'first', 'time', 'envy', 'are', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'quite', 'will', 'be', 'impressed', 'over', 'again', 'may', 'be', 'unable', 'remember', 'number', 'times', 'have', 'watched', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'again.Some', 'final', 'notes', 'dated', 'elements', 'movie', 'stand', 'out', 'rather', 'sorely', 'Steve', 'house', 'party', 'complete', 'hippies', 'brand', 'music', 'vernacular', 'was', 'already', 'anachronism', 'when', 'Mechanic', 'was', 'made', 'interior', 'call', 'girl', 'apartment', 'also', 'hopelessly', 'early', '70', 'karate', 'exhibition', 'Arthur', 'Steve', 'attend', 'laughable', 'as', 'well', 'exhibition', 'Arthur', 'tells', 'Steve', 'two', 'masters', 'wo', ""n't"", 'actually', 'hit', 'other', 'would', 'most', 'certainly', 'result', 'death', 'Regardless', 'fight', 'sequence', 'poorly', 'choreographed', 'entirely', 'unconvincing']",N/A

It wasn't bad, but not as good as I'd hoped, and the underlying issue --- all men kill, but some are licensed (the army, the police, Napoleon, etc) --- could have been explored in much more depth. Bronson kills partly to maintain his lavish lifestyle, but also because he looks on it as a form of art. His weakness is that he needs affection, or at least company, and his isolation makes him both tense and bored. Vincent's aspiration to match him proves his weak spot, as he takes this twisted youth on as an apprentice for ambiguous reasons. Vincent, however, merely wants to kill for pleasure. He is not given any assignment, as one reviewer seems to think, but sets up his chosen victim merely for the fun of it. Eventually, this exceedingly grim theme turns into a sort of over-the-top comedy, with a kind of joke ending which one can almost see coming. I hesitated about giving it 4 stars, but eventually decided on 3. It's quite well-acted, Bronson is always watchable, some of the action is tense and engaging, Vincent is a bit annoying, there's a travelogue thrown in, but it's not as good as it could have been.",3,The Devil's Apprentice,1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,1299,"['watching', 'Lawman', 'really', 'good', 'interesting', 'film', 'decided', 'Winner', 'must', 'be', 'better', 'director', 'usually', 'been', 'credited', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'not', 'as', 'good', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'underlying', 'issue', 'men', 'kill', 'are', 'licensed', 'army', 'police', 'Napoleon', 'etc', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'much', 'more', 'depth', 'Bronson', 'partly', 'maintain', 'lavish', 'lifestyle', 'also', 'form', 'art', 'weakness', 'affection', 'least', 'company', 'isolation', 'tense', 'bored', 'Vincent', 'aspiration', 'match', 'weak', 'spot', 'twisted', 'youth', 'apprentice', 'ambiguous', 'reasons', 'Vincent', 'however', 'merely', 'kill', 'pleasure', 'not', 'given', 'assignment', 'one', 'reviewer', 'think', 'up', 'chosen', 'victim', 'merely', 'fun', 'Eventually', 'exceedingly', 'grim', 'theme', 'sort', 'over-the-top', 'comedy', 'kind', 'joke', 'ending', 'one', 'can', 'almost', 'see', 'coming', 'hesitated', 'giving', '4', 'stars', 'eventually', 'decided', '3', 'quite', 'well-acted', 'Bronson', 'always', 'watchable', 'action', 'tense', 'engaging', 'Vincent', 'bit', 'annoying', 'travelogue', 'thrown', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been']",N/A

THE MECHANIC (action, 1972) Arthur Bishop (Charles Bronson) is the mechanic, a hit man hired by the Organization (a Mafia-life firm) as its own assassin. Bishop's contact to the Organization is Harry, a long time  confidant of his late father. Bishop is meticulous in his work. Before any  hits he studies the targets weaknesses so as not to leave any leaks. He is  without feelings or remorse, the consummate professional. Bishop's next  target is Harry. He carries the job through without hesitation. Harry's son  Steve (Jan-Michael Vincent) lives the life of a dilenta playboy. He  suspects Bishop's involvement in his father's death, and tries to find out  what his ties to the Organization are. Steve comes to admire Bishop's  unwavering and ruthless personality, as Bishop admires Steve's youthful  promiscuity and cunning nature. They are both alike. Bishop takes him under  his wing and trains him as his new partner. On their first hit together  their assigned to a ""cowboy ride"" (a hit that has to be done quickly). It  turns out to be a set-up engineered by the Organization. Bishop escapes,  but someone is still out to eliminate him.Critique: As far as spy and  espionage films go The Mechanic is one of the best. Not only for those  Charles Bronson aficionados (like myself), but for lovers of well-made  auctioneer. Michael Winner's clever direction adds a sparkle to the genre.  He sets up interesting insights into assassin's mode of work. A cut above  Death Wish (1974- Bronson's best known film), in both content and script,  Bronson's performance is the epitome of cool. He's perfect at playing a  character that has been totally detached from the outside world, and a man  trapped in a world he can only have created. In the same way that Steve  McQueen used his laconic presence to great use, Winner makes full use of  Bronson's craggy features.QUOTE: Bishop: ""Murder is killing without a  license.

The long wordless sequences of a cerebral Bronson tediously plotting and staging smooth complex hits are fascinating and rewarding for the patient viewer. Set to Fielding's quiet spooky piano score and natural sounds, Winter uses mature camera work, beautiful moody lighting, and some creative flash editing to draw you into the unspoken existential crisis of this stoic aging assassin as he spends his lonely free time between jobs enjoying the finest wines, staring at morbid paintings, and in one of the film's more painful depressing scenes....paying prostitutes to read detached love letters to him.Unfortunately the tense movie seems to draw towards its inevitable climax far too soon while the more elaborate action attempts that dominate the final act are blandly shot, cheap looking, and ultimately dated despite beautiful Italian locations. Set mostly in sophisicated but dreary 70s mansions, the rugged street wise Bronson looks out of place at points, but maybe that's the point, he's ultimately a caveman confused and lost in the solitary gentleman charade of his own creation.  This might be his finest acting, his weary pained expressions conveying a terrible dread and internal conflict he simply can't bring himself to face. He's compellingly ambiguous, never letting us know what's really on his mind.  As Bronson's sociopathic understudy and only other major character, blonde sweater wearing Jan Michael Vincent  is painfully wooden and unconvincing, but given his character, it oddly works.-Dan of Dangerdiablogik.com",4,Some things age better than others...,1296172800,"01 28, 2011",2011,1610,"['Mechanic', 'excels', 'when', 'most', 'thoughtful', 'methodical', 'long', 'wordless', 'sequences', 'cerebral', 'Bronson', 'tediously', 'plotting', 'staging', 'smooth', 'complex', 'hits', 'are', 'fascinating', 'rewarding', 'patient', 'viewer', 'Set', 'Fielding', 'quiet', 'spooky', 'piano', 'score', 'natural', 'sounds', 'Winter', 'mature', 'camera', 'work', 'beautiful', 'moody', 'lighting', 'creative', 'flash', 'editing', 'draw', 'unspoken', 'existential', 'crisis', 'stoic', 'aging', 'assassin', 'lonely', 'free', 'time', 'jobs', 'enjoying', 'finest', 'wines', 'staring', 'morbid', 'paintings', 'one', 'film', 'more', 'painful', 'depressing', 'scenes', '.paying', 'prostitutes', 'read', 'detached', 'letters', 'him.Unfortunately', 'tense', 'movie', 'draw', 'towards', 'inevitable', 'climax', 'far', 'too', 'soon', 'more', 'elaborate', 'action', 'attempts', 'dominate', 'final', 'act', 'are', 'blandly', 'shot', 'cheap', 'looking', 'ultimately', 'dated', 'beautiful', 'Italian', 'locations', 'Set', 'mostly', 'sophisicated', 'dreary', '70s', 'mansions', 'rugged', 'street', 'wise', 'Bronson', 'place', 'points', 'maybe', 'point', 'ultimately', 'caveman', 'confused', 'lost', 'solitary', 'gentleman', 'charade', 'own', 'creation', 'might', 'be', 'finest', 'acting', 'weary', 'pained', 'expressions', 'conveying', 'terrible', 'dread', 'internal', 'conflict', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'face', 'compellingly', 'ambiguous', 'never', 'letting', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'mind', 'Bronson', 'sociopathic', 'understudy', 'only', 'other', 'major', 'character', 'blonde', 'sweater', 'wearing', 'Jan', 'Michael', 'Vincent', 'painfully', 'wooden', 'unconvincing', 'given', 'character', 'oddly', 'works.-Dan', 'Dangerdiablogik.com']",N/A

We see Bronson's character set up a hit disguised as a gas explosion. He sets up across the street from his target and watches the man make coffee (presumably), read a book and then fall asleep - all the while knowing that in a matter of hours he will be the method of the mans destruction.In another scene we see Bronson perform another hit, this time on a person who trusts him and then in another we see him coldly explain to a desperate young girl how long it will take her to die and the feelings and sensations she will go through before death.Taken at its basic level this movie is very disturbing. Anyone who is expecting another GROSSE POINT BLANK will not get it here. This movie is both cold and voyeuristically fascinating to see a man who cares little about life  - others or even his own (he blatently ignores a doctors advice at one point, even throwing away some pills designed to help him with anxiety).The movie is a strange one. There is very little action, and what we do have seems muted by the experiences of Bishop.",3,Very 70s B-action movie curiously devoid of action,1100304000,"11 13, 2004",2004,1473,"['Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'movies', '1970s', '1980s', 'will', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'made', '1972', 'longtime', 'Bronson', 'collaborator', 'Michael', 'Winner.Bronson', 'hitman', 'Bishop', 'who', 'eager', 'young', 'rookie', 'played', 'very', 'young', 'Jan', 'Michael', 'Vincent', 'later', 'AIRWOLF', 'fame', 'wing', 'teach', 'ways', 'craft.Probably', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'see', 'Bronson', 'character', 'set', 'up', 'hit', 'disguised', 'gas', 'explosion', 'up', 'street', 'target', 'man', 'make', 'coffee', 'presumably', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'fall', 'asleep', 'while', 'knowing', 'matter', 'hours', 'will', 'be', 'method', 'mans', 'destruction.In', 'scene', 'see', 'Bronson', 'perform', 'hit', 'time', 'person', 'who', 'then', 'see', 'coldly', 'explain', 'desperate', 'young', 'girl', 'how', 'long', 'will', 'take', 'die', 'feelings', 'sensations', 'will', 'go', 'before', 'death.Taken', 'basic', 'level', 'movie', 'very', 'disturbing', 'Anyone', 'who', 'expecting', 'GROSSE', 'POINT', 'BLANK', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'here', 'movie', 'cold', 'voyeuristically', 'fascinating', 'see', 'man', 'who', 'little', 'life', 'others', 'even', 'own', 'blatently', 'doctors', 'advice', 'one', 'point', 'even', 'throwing', 'away', 'pills', 'designed', 'help', 'anxiety', '.The', 'movie', 'strange', 'one', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'muted', 'experiences', 'Bishop']",N/A

Never trust in anyone; no matter what your intentions be; remeber two very close related films with this one; Donnie Brasco and Wall street.The script turns around a smart paid assasin; his works are extremely clean and he makes those murderslook like simple accidents: the long opening sequence is wonderful , a silent depict without any introduction; the film is direct and deeply absorbimg.Later he'll meet his next victim and wil befriendof the son of that one. Obviously he made a wrong choice; you know, in this business,and that choice will become the spark of his end.The script flow runs organical; our mechanic has several nightmares; and also he suffers from insomnia. He makes his assignments as he was a chess player; the locations are superb; specially the last one in Naples.Jan Michael Vincent worked out as a perfect balance to the mechanic: but warning; because you never must underestimate your enemy.The ancestral myth of Icaro appears in this sense; too much proud; too much arrogance ; a briliant intelligence without a prudence dosis; a lion with fierce moods but without any sense of the rules of game.

It is important to note that there is no character dialogue for the first 15 minutes of the movie. This element was basically born in the Spaghetti Western and demonstrated in Sergio Leone's masterpiece The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.Like Death Wish, The Mechanic exhibits many classic features of 1970's cinema. For example, towards the beginning of the film there are many psychedelic qualities that were influenced by the year of the film, 1972. No doubt The Mechanic showcases one of Bronson's best characters and keeps a solid story, but let's be honest, the acting really isn't great. Nevertheless, there is something about watching a movie about a hitman who has an appreciation for the arts.

He is the ultimate assassin, organized, crafty,driven, and akin to spys, a gentleman and professional in what he does -- assassination.  Ashe gets older, he needs to groom a young buck to help.  In this case, it is ironic.  The youngbuck turns out to be the son of the man he has known for a long time, but becomes his currenttarget.  Instead of shooting his target, he causes him to have a heart attack while runningup hill from a sniper attack.  This seems a bit more humane for an old friend.  However, as mostof you can guess, the young buck learns his trade well and even has a predilection for it.  Youngbuck learns of his father's fate at the hands of his now current teacher and seeks revenge ala theyoung, cavalier buck that he is; but yet outsmarted in the end.  Moral of the story is: neverscrew with your teacher.  In this case screwer becomes screwee.  Old teacher gets the last laughbecause he studied his protege's strengths and weaknesses and kept a cool head.  I'm sure you'veseen the new Mechanic out with ""Transporter"" star Jason Stratham.

I have always enjoyed watching his movies.I consider this particular one as the best of his action movies.The storyline is pretty straight-forward, except for an unexpected twist at the end: A contract hit-man, seemingly about to retire, took on a cocky young man as protege, who eventually turned the table on the master.Charles Bronson, played the contract hit-man (hence, the name, The Mechanic), Arthur Bishop. He was a loner but had expensive tastes. He worked for a sinister group known only as The Organisation, which issued all the contract hits. [It so happened that all the hits were criminals.] He took on Steve McKenna (played by Jan-Michael Vincent) as his protege. His mind was cold as ice & apparently twisted.  They screwed up one hit assignment while working together, after which The Organisation, was upset & put out a contract on Bishop. Apparently, McKenna took up the contract. The rest of the movie was a battle of wits among the two hitmen.What struck me most about the movie was the quiet characteristion of a contract hit during the first fifteen minutes or so. No dialogue at all,...only a very sober music score. Bishop studied the habits, life-style & schedule of his target, with meticulous observation & detailed planning. Thereafter, the movie went on to show Bishop, working with McKenna, going after different targets - each with different circumstances & each executed differently...ruthlessly, of course. The hot-pursuit action sequences - there were many of them - in the movie were beautifully orchestrated,...really exciting, especially the motor-cycle chase segment.There seemed to be one puzzling part in the movie: McKenna happened to be the son of one of Bishop's hit victims. Bishop knew McKenna's father, Big Harry (played by Keenan Wynn) since he was a kid. In fact, Big Harry was an associate of Bishop's own father, who also happened to be a founding father of The Organisation. I can only conclude this way: hitmen have certainly to be cold-blooded animals. Not only that, they have to be calculatingly efficient in their work.The last fifteen minutes of the movie were quite unexpected. I would have preferred a totally different outcome. Go & watch this movie to find out what I meant.On the whole, I find The Mechanic, to be an intelligent action thriller, with Charles Bronson in his best action role!",5,Watch Charles Bronson in his best action role!,1154476800,"08 2, 2006",2006,2785,"['sixties', 'most', 'movies', 'have', 'watched', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'was', 'always', 'tough', 'guy', 'gritty', 'man', 'action', 'macho', 'man', 'Great', 'Escape', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'Chato', 'Land', 'Mr', 'Majestyck', 'Death', 'Wish', 'IV', 'Family', 'Cops', 'III', 'Telefon', 'Murphy', 'Law', 'Red', 'Sun', '10', 'Midnight', 'Evil', 'Men', 'Do', 'one', 'Sandpiper', 'played', 'painter', 'opposite', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movies.I', 'consider', 'particular', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'movies.The', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'straight-forward', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'end', 'contract', 'hit-man', 'seemingly', 'retire', 'took', 'cocky', 'young', 'man', 'protege', 'who', 'eventually', 'turned', 'table', 'master.Charles', 'Bronson', 'played', 'contract', 'hit-man', 'hence', 'name', 'Mechanic', 'Arthur', 'Bishop', 'was', 'loner', 'had', 'expensive', 'tastes', 'worked', 'sinister', 'group', 'known', 'only', 'Organisation', 'issued', 'contract', '[', 'so', 'happened', 'hits', 'were', 'criminals', ']', 'took', 'Steve', 'McKenna', 'played', 'Jan-Michael', 'Vincent', 'protege', 'mind', 'was', 'cold', 'ice', 'apparently', 'twisted', 'screwed', 'up', 'one', 'hit', 'assignment', 'working', 'together', 'Organisation', 'was', 'upset', 'put', 'out', 'contract', 'Bishop', 'Apparently', 'McKenna', 'took', 'up', 'contract', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'battle', 'wits', 'two', 'struck', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'quiet', 'characteristion', 'contract', 'hit', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'so', 'dialogue', 'only', 'very', 'sober', 'music', 'score', 'Bishop', 'studied', 'habits', 'life-style', 'schedule', 'target', 'meticulous', 'observation', 'detailed', 'planning', 'Thereafter', 'movie', 'went', 'show', 'Bishop', 'working', 'McKenna', 'going', 'different', 'targets', 'different', 'circumstances', 'executed', 'differently', 'ruthlessly', 'course', 'hot-pursuit', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'many', 'movie', 'were', 'beautifully', 'orchestrated', 'really', 'exciting', 'especially', 'motor-cycle', 'chase', 'segment.There', 'seemed', 'be', 'one', 'puzzling', 'part', 'movie', 'McKenna', 'happened', 'be', 'son', 'one', 'Bishop', 'hit', 'victims', 'Bishop', 'knew', 'McKenna', 'father', 'Big', 'Harry', 'played', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'was', 'kid', 'fact', 'Big', 'Harry', 'was', 'associate', 'Bishop', 'own', 'father', 'who', 'also', 'happened', 'be', 'founding', 'father', 'Organisation', 'can', 'only', 'conclude', 'way', 'hitmen', 'have', 'certainly', 'be', 'cold-blooded', 'animals', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'be', 'calculatingly', 'efficient', 'work.The', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'movie', 'were', 'quite', 'unexpected', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'totally', 'different', 'outcome', 'Go', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'meant.On', 'whole', 'find', 'Mechanic', 'be', 'intelligent', 'action', 'thriller', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'best', 'action', 'role']",N/A

One of the key elements in an action film is editing and the director, Michael Winner, is working here with a terrific film editor. Editing is what gives a film its pacing, its momentum, and there are few categories of film other than action thrillers for which editing is as important.Bronson is great here because his dialogue is really lean and mean.  There's a terrific scene with a woman who seems to be his lover but really isn't.  The revelation in that scene (no spoilers here!) reinforces the main character's inner workings which are both tough and, to put it bluntly, twisted.What also gives this film its power is the superb script by Lewis John Carlino, writer of a number of thrillers. This is one of Carlino's earliest film scripts and he does an outstanding job--striking a perfect balance between the protagonist's cynical irony and the flat out action that is an inevitable part of his work as a mechanic--a killer for hire.He goes after a number of targets--each with different circumstances, each done differently.  The variety of killing situations is also a critical component adding to this film's power.A young Jan-Michael Vincent is on hand here in one of his earlier films. Though not as convincing as Bronson, he nevertheless goes through his paces well as Bronson's &quot;associate&quot;.  Keenan Wynn, as Vincent's father, is good, too, and the other supporting cast does exactly what needs to be done to make this a thriller that does not disappoint.You know it's good when you truly cannot wait to see what happens next, when the characters' situations propel you forward, when every element of the film--dialogue, acting, editing, music (a GREAT score by Jerry Fielding), and ultra-sharp directing makes you hungry for every next minute.Highly recommended for thriller junkies.

The script, actors, direction, cinematography and feel is like nothing else Bronson or any others have done before or since.  Arthur Bishop(Bronson) is a hit man.  Methodical and efficient as well as 'it's simply a job' is pulled off very well.  The Mechanic was done in the same time frame, early 70's when Bronson was (in my opinion) at the height of his career.  Within a few years he did The Mechanic, Chato's Land, Death Wish(1st one), Breakheart Pass, and Red Sun.  In the Mechanic Bronson 'helps' a close friend 'Big' Harry McKenna (Keenan Wynn) by taking on Steve McKenna (Jan-Michael Vincent) as sort of a 'father/teacher' figure.  The young protege Steve knows and learns even more about being a hitman.  As he works and learns with Bishop, you get the feeling that this kid is a natural for the job.  He's a bit arrogant, self assured, calloused, and tough enough.  The supporting cast and characters are well developed and believable without going 'overboard' in the action.  There are several twists, turns, surprises thougout the movie that later you think.... hmmmm I should have thought of/seen that coming.  One scene in the movie with Steve McKenna (Jan-Michael Vincent) his girlfriend Louise(Linda Ridgeway) and Bishop (Bronson) is a little difficult/disturbing to watch but it's one scene that is absolutely necessary to the essence of both Bishop and Steve's characters.

He goes about the job very much as a calm man of business, and one of the neatest aspects of the film to me is that while he never really loses the facade, it's clear that in taking on young McKenna - who he has formed a bond with over a couple of social outings after the older McKenna's funeral - he has allowed a potentially fatal emotional relationship to obscure his clear vision.The film is basically structured as a series of fairly elaborate action set pieces with the developing relationship between the older and younger assassins taking place in between. All of the action sequences are very well put together and play out in some interesting and unexpected ways; after the opening scene my favorite is probably the motorcycle race which comes a little over halfway through the film, fascinating in part because it's Bronson who takes off after the escaping victim and not the expected speed-freak Vincent.I don't want to spoil the ending, which has one of the funnier twists I've seen in any action movie, so I'll just say that I for one never saw the last couple of scenes coming. As I mention in my review for DEATH WISH, director Michael Winner really knows how to plot a simple, linear action piece for all it's worth and without allowing too many distractions to creep in. The music, even more excellent than in the later film, sounded to me like Jerry Goldsmith in experimental-percussive Planet of the Apes mode, but in fact it is by Jerry Fielding.",4,Exciting and often funny 70s action/buddy movie with a nice ending twist,1254182400,"09 29, 2009",2009,2220,"['Two', 'years', 'DEATH', 'WISH', 'Bronson', 'played', 'completely', 'amoral', 'hit-man', 'THE', 'MECHANIC', 'first', 'class', 'action/thriller', 'most', 'part', 'troublesome', 'moral', 'questions', 'later', 'film', 'only', 'morality', 'really', ""n't"", 'part', 'equation', 'Bronson', 'Arthur', 'Bishop', 'high-priced', 'mechanic', 'who', 'up', 'taking', 'younger', 'cockier', 'too-enthusiastic', 'Steve', 'McKenna', 'Jan-Michael', 'Vincent', 'less', 'wooden', 'usual', 'here', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'shortly', 'McKenna', 'father', 'always', 'wonderful', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', '.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'opening', 'set-up', 'see', 'Bishop', 'calmly', 'methodically', 'set', 'up', 'extremely', 'complicated', 'hit', 'apartment', 'building', 'New', 'York', 'staging', 'street', 'job', 'very', 'much', 'calm', 'man', 'business', 'one', 'neatest', 'aspects', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'facade', 'clear', 'taking', 'young', 'McKenna', 'who', 'formed', 'bond', 'couple', 'social', 'outings', 'older', 'McKenna', 'funeral', 'allowed', 'potentially', 'fatal', 'emotional', 'relationship', 'obscure', 'clear', 'vision.The', 'film', 'basically', 'structured', 'series', 'fairly', 'elaborate', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'developing', 'relationship', 'older', 'younger', 'assassins', 'taking', 'place', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'play', 'out', 'interesting', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'opening', 'scene', 'favorite', 'probably', 'motorcycle', 'race', 'little', 'over', 'halfway', 'film', 'fascinating', 'part', 'Bronson', 'who', 'off', 'escaping', 'victim', 'not', 'expected', 'speed-freak', 'Vincent.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'ending', 'one', 'funnier', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'action', 'movie', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'one', 'never', 'saw', 'last', 'couple', 'scenes', 'coming', 'mention', 'review', 'DEATH', 'WISH', 'director', 'Michael', 'Winner', 'really', 'how', 'plot', 'simple', 'linear', 'action', 'piece', 'worth', 'allowing', 'too', 'many', 'distractions', 'creep', 'music', 'even', 'more', 'excellent', 'later', 'film', 'sounded', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'experimental-percussive', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'mode', 'fact', 'Jerry', 'Fielding']",N/A

One uses death as a means of survival, making his bread and butter by putting bodies in the gutter. His name is Charles Bronson.  The other is a surf-boy psycho with a penchant for torture and morbid voyeurism.  He is Jan Michael Vincent.Bronson works for the mob, fixing the clinks and clanks in the organization's outfit.  One day, Jan Michael catches on to Bronson's endeavors and entreats him to learn more.  What ensues is a quasi-father/son relationship where they master the finer points of popping someone in the dome or blowing them up, instead of learning to bait a hook or throw a curveball.  Then, our young apprentice develops his own ideas, as does the mob Charles works for...Bronson is on point with his rock face and straight-to-the-point-manly-man dialogue.  Jan is perfect as the inquisitive scamp wanting to learn the ins and outs of killing folks for a living (and enjoying it all the way).  It has some surreal/absurd scenes, such as the dirty, hippy party and another where Bronson and Jan watch Jan's girl hemorrhage slowly after she dices her own wrists.  The intrigue builds and leads you to a path where you think you might have an idea how it will all end.  But this is Charlie Bronson, one of the toughest tough guys to ever get...tough.

282338,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,6301971426,Pork Chop,"[2, 2]","The Mechanic (1972) is a remarkable action movie featuring ahard-hitting yet subtle actor playing Mr Bishop, a work-for-hirecontract killer, hired by a large, international, powerful,far-reaching  and wealthy syndicate for piece-meal jobs. As such,this role is extremely well played by Charles Bronson, especiallythe part of someone who is able to keep his cool under any and allcircumstances. Here, at one point,  Jan-Michael Vincent's character,Steve McKenna will test that capacity even further.From a cinematographic point of view, the picture is wide-screen,(and at least for a large chunk of the movie), is remarkable  inclarity, color,  contrast, lighting quality,  such as in the oceanside moments, or Bronson doing surveillance by the window of anapartment. The action scenes are flawless, those being essentialparts for viewers, with a special mention given to a Fiat or Lanciacar spinning off a cliff, near Naples, IT.The soundtrack is evidently scored by a classically trainedcomposer, sometimes reminiscent of Anton Webern's pieces, and apleasure for viewers. The only suggestion would have been to mutethe calm music over 2 or 3 scenes, (such as the motocross stuntscenes  and car chases, which is distracting to the storyline) and atighter editing overall, of the slower moments.This seems to be rooted in a book, considering the artistic depth ofthe story, and the effort in demonstrating a millionaire's lifestyleboth by Bronson's contact in the outfit, but  also in Bronson's ownhome, showing paintings from Hieronymous Bosch, sculptures, a stereoplaying numbers by a violin string quartet, a lavishly furnishedhome coupled with cocktail gardens outside a 10 million dollarmansion, an expensive garden, etc.The intriguing aspect, is the question surrounding how much of the""facts"" being real ?Bronson and Vincent discuss contract work, underline the absolutenecessity of concealing the circumstances of the victim's real finalmoments, in fooling the coroner or police who stumble upon the body.For example, by provoking fear, panic, and running in an elderlymark who has a heart condition, a contract is filled as therespiration ceases. Another, is an explosion in an apartment, froman apparent gas leak, that is contrived from several days ofpreparation.The attention to detail in the script, is not only painstaking, buta forensics 101, soldier of fortune 101 and combat duty 101 allrolled into one.Bronson is shown using a full spectrum of products and services incarrying out his assigned duties, ranging from using a firing range,martial arts, developing negatives in a dark room from film shotwith a powerful zoom, assembling a sharpshooter's rifle with asilencer, physical fitness with jogging and a pulse meter, pilotingan airplane, doing recon in the area on motocross, being an expertin disguises, (often showing a disheveled appearance), pickinglocks, hot-wiring a car to start the engine, driving a plow truck,scuba diving with oxygen tank, water proofing firearms, stockingdetonation grenades, preparing chemical concoctions (tea bagreplacements containing sleeping ingredients or combustiblematerials), knife throwing, mastering remote eavesdropping and,Roger Wilco systems, booby traps, setups, etc. No doubt, only aunit's quartermaster could efficiently equip Bronson for all thatwas demonstrated, or a Hollywood studio.Considering that much of the subject is controversial and psychotic,the script calls upon happier scenes to rebalance viewers from timeto time, such ilming the Los Angeles Zoo, Marineland, showing thelocal Wax Museum, and oceanside of beaches in the area, a scene withJill Ireland,  a topless bar, tennis match, etc.The saying ""live by the sword, die by the sword"" comes true, as themechanics are taken out, by their employers, as easily as their pastrubout targets.

That is, he's a hit man, actually an elite hit man who eliminates the scum of society.  Bishop asks the above question to his younger soon-to-be apprentice or ""associate"" (Jan-Michael Vincent).  Once Bishop takes on this apprentice, things become interesting.One of the things that is so interesting about this movie is that there is no dialogue in its first fifteen minutes.  We get to see Bishop meticulously doing his craft.This movie might be called an action-thriller.  Yes, it has plenty of physical action but for me the action was psychological.  As a result, this movie might be called a thinking-person's movie.Towards the end, there is a lot of neat twists and turns culminating in an ending that I never saw coming.Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2002) is perfect in visual and audio quality.

Starting out in inumerable 'B' movies of the cusp of the forties and into the fifties and moving on to villiany in 'A' movies by the late fifties and through the mid sixties, Bronson had been a familiar face to audiences for twenty years culminating in The Dirty Dozen in 1967,his first semi-sympathetic role. Then he went to Europe and made a series of hugely successful tough guy movies, became an International Star and came back to Hollywood for twenty years of definitive headlining tough guy roles that paved the way for Willis, Schwartzzenneger (never CAN spell that), Van-Damne and the host of other macho-men parading through our cineplexes to the present day.  He was quiet, soft-spoken, and old school.  He was loved by his onset crews (which says more than any critics of his movies) and he never acted like a star.  In short, while lots of pretenders get credited, he was the last true product of the Hollywood Studio system, only he survived to achieve greater heights under the new regime.

282349,AYYOPF6RG019D,6301971426,The Mechanic,"[5, 5]","As one of the first reviewers wrote, ""look beneath the surface-this is one deep film"".  I agree completely.  I love this movie, but I think what's hurt it is that it's billed as an action movie when it really isn't.  Whether that was the original intention or not, I don't know.  Either way, what we get is actually a character study that is masterfully done.  If you're looking for scene after scene of action, this is NOT the movie for you.  Anyone that knows something about Charles Bronson probably has a pretty simplistic view of him: as the stone faced actor who was in A LOT of action movies, or, ""that guy in 'Death Wish'"".  For those who've seen and 'get' this movie, we know Bronson actually was more than that.  I saw 'Death Wish' again in 2003 or 2004, and I thought it was dull.  The idea behind it was more interesting than the movie itself, particularly after repeated viewings and the passing of time.  'The Mechanic' is different.  Bronson's natural quality of not giving anything away (on the outside) is perfect for the character of Arthur Bishop.  One of the many things I like about this movie is how we see that, although he pretends that all the killing does not register on his conscience, it actually does.  He faints at an aquarium, a scene very well done.  Then, curiously, he throws away a prescription for anti-anxiety medication.  He ignores the suggestion that he see a psychiatrist.  After all, what would he say?--""Doc, I kill people for a living, and it doesn't sit well with something inside of me.""  One reviewer noted that he seems trapped in a fated spiral, once he takes on the apprentice.  I can see something of that.  But, also as the other reviewer noted, is he trapped or is he letting certain aspects 'ride' while having a contingency plan in case things with the apprentice don't work out?  This is another great aspect of the movie-the friendship between Bronson and Vincent.  There is a competitive quality to their relationship that alludes to the limits of their friendship.  I (like the other reviewers) won't give away the ending, but it, along with the fantastic first 16 minutes of the movie, are the highlights (for me).  I love Arthur Bishop's house too.  As someone who is very solitary, I'd love to have that kind of space and privacy.  Lastly, this movie DOES stay with you after it's over.  I've seen it close to 100 times (no exaggeration!) since 1993, even taping the audio portion once when I had no TV or VCR/DVD player, only a stereo to keep me company.  Forget 'Death Wish'-this is THE Charles Bronson movie to watch, again and again.  Buy it, because even if you are only lukewarm on it at first, it'll grow on you--I promise.",5,"""Nobody lives forever...""",1112054400,"03 29, 2005",2005,2693,"['one', 'first', 'reviewers', 'wrote', 'look', 'surface-this', 'one', 'deep', 'film', 'agree', 'completely', 'love', 'movie', 'think', 'what', 'hurt', 'billed', 'action', 'movie', 'when', 'really', ""n't"", 'Whether', 'was', 'original', 'intention', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'way', 'what', 'get', 'actually', 'character', 'study', 'masterfully', 'done', ""'re"", 'looking', 'scene', 'scene', 'action', 'NOT', 'movie', 'Anyone', 'something', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'probably', 'pretty', 'simplistic', 'view', 'stone', 'faced', 'actor', 'who', 'was', 'A', 'LOT', 'action', 'movies', 'guy', 'Wish', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'get"", 'movie', 'know', 'Bronson', 'actually', 'was', 'more', 'saw', 'Wish', 'again', '2003', '2004', 'thought', 'was', 'dull', 'idea', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'movie', 'particularly', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'passing', 'time', 'Mechanic', 'different', 'Bronson', 'natural', 'quality', 'not', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'outside', 'perfect', 'character', 'Arthur', 'Bishop', 'One', 'many', 'things', 'like', 'movie', 'how', 'see', 'killing', 'not', 'register', 'conscience', 'actually', 'aquarium', 'scene', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Then', 'curiously', 'away', 'prescription', 'anti-anxiety', 'medication', 'suggestion', 'see', 'psychiatrist', 'what', 'would', 'say', 'Doc', 'kill', 'people', 'living', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'something', 'One', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'trapped', 'fated', 'spiral', 'once', 'apprentice', 'can', 'see', 'something', 'also', 'other', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'trapped', 'letting', 'certain', 'aspects', 'having', 'contingency', 'plan', 'case', 'things', 'apprentice', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'great', 'aspect', 'movie-the', 'friendship', 'Bronson', 'Vincent', 'competitive', 'quality', 'relationship', 'limits', 'friendship', 'other', 'reviewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'fantastic', 'first', '16', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'highlights', 'love', 'Arthur', 'Bishop', 'house', 'too', 'someone', 'who', 'very', 'solitary', ""'d"", 'love', 'have', 'kind', 'space', 'privacy', 'Lastly', 'movie', 'DOES', 'stay', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'close', '100', 'times', 'exaggeration', '1993', 'even', 'taping', 'audio', 'portion', 'once', 'when', 'had', 'TV', 'VCR/DVD', 'player', 'only', 'stereo', 'keep', 'company', 'Forget', ""Wish'-this"", 'THE', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'movie', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'Buy', 'even', 'are', 'only', 'lukewarm', 'first', ""'ll"", 'grow', 'promise']",N/A

Arthur Bishop is a meticulous hitman, a mechanic, who prepares to make his hits with an incredible sense of detail.  Whoever hires him knows the job will get done.  After several successful hits, Bishop takes a young protege under his wing who happens to be the son of one of his victims.  Bishop teaches the hitman trainee everything there is to know about the business, causing his employers to become upset with him.  From the opening silence(it is 16 minutes before a word is spoken) to the shocking/surprising ending, The Mechanic has it all.  Plenty of action, including a very good motorcycle chase, and a very tense Jerry Fielding score help to make this movie a must-see.  Don't miss one of Charles Bronson's best movies.In one of his best roles and one of my favorites, Charles Bronson stars as Arthur Bishop, the cold-blooded, ruthless hitman who meticulously plans his every hit.  Jan-Michael Vincent is surprisingly good as Steve McKenna, Bishop's young protege trying to become as good a hitman as his elder.  Bronson and Vincent work very well together as Bishop attempts to teach McKenna the ways of the profession.  Keenan Wynn makes a brief appearance as ""Big Harry"" McKenna, Steve's father and a past associate of Bishop's father.  Bronson's wife Jill Ireland and Linda Ridgeway also star.

But even such obedience is no guarantee of longevity.  Loyalty and service doesn't seem to matter, once it has been decided that it is your time to die.  Those are the rules, and they are enforced.Part of this system is the ""mechanic"", a hit man that kills at the direction of the higher ups.  Arthur Bishop (Charles Bronson) is such a man.  Once a target has been selected, personal information about his health, history and habits are provided.  From there it is left to the mechanic formulate a method for killing, and then complete the job.The film opens with Bishop setting up for a kill.  There is no dialog for the first 15 minutes, as we follow the process.  After studying the victim's lifestyle, an elaborate and violent death is planned and executed.  One might think a low-key approach would have been preferred to such overkill.Bishop's next mission is designed to show us the heart of the killer, as McKenna (Keenan Wynn), an old family friend, is his next victim.  This time death by natural causes seems to be in order, as Bishop delivers death with a personal touch.  What's strange is how the light levels change.  The scene starts in broad daylight and ends a few minutes later in near darkness.  This is complete nonsense and just poor filmmaking.Jan Michael Vincent is McKenna's son, Steve.  Cold, cocky, and twisted, he attaches himself to Bishop seeking to be his apprentice.  Once on board, Bishop tries to train both Steve's mind as well as body.  On their first assignment, things do not go quite as planned.  The mission while messy, is still accomplished, but not without creating some waves.  Bishop's decision to take a partner, does not sit well with some in the ""Organization"".  Smooth execution of the next assignment, a hit in Naples, is essential to calm the disgruntled.  The change of scenery helps.  The action sequences in Italy are the best in the movie, as the pair work more smoothly together, the second time out.  No one spoils this movie by giving away the ending.What is a Bronson movie without his wife, actress Jill lreland?  This time it's a cameo as a prostitute.

A one-time Cliff Robertson vehicle (which at least explains the pipe Charles Bronson smokes throughout the film) and a clear influence on the Wachowski Brothers later script for Assassins, it sees Charles Bronson as the mob's most assured and ingenious hitman for some reason taking on an apprentice, attracted perhaps by his sociopathic indifference to death. The first half of the film is so sharp that it's a shame the rest of the movie starts down a more conventional road, but the action is well-handled, with a couple of way above average stunts involving a crashing motorbike and, later on, a car pushed off a mountain road that is more comprehensively trashed on the way down than you've ever seen in a film before or since: this one doesn't need to go up in a fireball to convince it's occupant isn't walking away.Unfortunately the sorcerer's pathological apprentice is played by terminally smug Jan Michael Vincent (the man who sued the paramedics who saved his life after a drunken crash for not managing to do so without damaging his vocal cords): ideal casting, perhaps, but he's definitely a below-par Dennis Quaid act as an actor who seems to think he's good looking enough not to have to at least try to act. Equally unfortunately it also features the inevitable Jill Ireland (the star's wife and director's former girlfriend: that must have made for some interesting conversations on the set), albeit only for one scene, and for once there's a rather clever and perfectly valid reason for her bad acting. It doesn't make her big scene any less painful to watch but at least it stops it from doing any real damage to the film. If at times it feels like a more ambitious film may have been lost in rewrites, there's still a pleasingly nasty ending and any film where the first 15 minutes are played without dialogue gets extra points in my book.MGM/UA's Region 1 disc may only offer a reissue trailer as an extra (when the title was changed to Killer of Killers to boost business from people who might have mistaken the original title for a car chase movie) but it has a fine widescreen transfer as well as a fullscreen version of the film.",4,A killer of a thriller,1172966400,"03 4, 2007",2007,2279,"['Mechanic', 'aka', 'Killer', 'Killers', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'unusually', 'Michael', 'Winner', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'directed', 'one-time', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'vehicle', 'least', 'pipe', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'smokes', 'film', 'clear', 'influence', 'Wachowski', 'Brothers', 'later', 'script', 'Assassins', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'mob', 'most', 'assured', 'ingenious', 'hitman', 'reason', 'taking', 'apprentice', 'attracted', 'perhaps', 'sociopathic', 'indifference', 'death', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'so', 'sharp', 'shame', 'rest', 'movie', 'down', 'more', 'conventional', 'road', 'action', 'well-handled', 'couple', 'way', 'average', 'stunts', 'involving', 'crashing', 'motorbike', 'later', 'car', 'pushed', 'off', 'mountain', 'road', 'more', 'comprehensively', 'trashed', 'way', 'down', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'one', ""n't"", 'need', 'go', 'up', 'fireball', 'convince', 'occupant', ""n't"", 'walking', 'away.Unfortunately', 'sorcerer', 'pathological', 'apprentice', 'played', 'terminally', 'smug', 'Jan', 'Michael', 'Vincent', 'man', 'who', 'sued', 'paramedics', 'who', 'saved', 'life', 'drunken', 'crash', 'not', 'managing', 'do', 'so', 'damaging', 'vocal', 'cords', 'ideal', 'casting', 'perhaps', 'definitely', 'below-par', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'act', 'actor', 'who', 'think', 'good', 'looking', 'enough', 'not', 'have', 'least', 'try', 'act', 'Equally', 'unfortunately', 'also', 'inevitable', 'Jill', 'Ireland', 'star', 'wife', 'director', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'must', 'have', 'made', 'interesting', 'conversations', 'set', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'once', 'rather', 'clever', 'perfectly', 'valid', 'reason', 'bad', 'acting', ""n't"", 'make', 'big', 'scene', 'less', 'painful', 'watch', 'least', 'doing', 'real', 'damage', 'film', 'times', 'more', 'ambitious', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'rewrites', 'still', 'pleasingly', 'nasty', 'ending', 'film', 'where', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'are', 'played', 'dialogue', 'extra', 'points', 'book.MGM/UA', 'Region', '1', 'disc', 'may', 'only', 'offer', 'reissue', 'trailer', 'extra', 'when', 'title', 'was', 'changed', 'Killer', 'Killers', 'boost', 'business', 'people', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'mistaken', 'original', 'title', 'car', 'chase', 'movie', 'fine', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'as', 'well', 'fullscreen', 'version', 'film']",N/A
