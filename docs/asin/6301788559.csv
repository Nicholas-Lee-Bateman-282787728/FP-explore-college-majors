The Gods Must Be Crazy II was a wreck of a picture. Probably the film worked for people under the age of ten, and that's about it. The replaced cast was uninspiring this time around, and the story was terrible in a cheesy way, almost failing to capture the spirit of 80's films. I didn't care much for X!xau this time around.

As one might expect, it's not quite as good as the original, but it was still very enjoyable.We're back in the Kalahari, and Xixo, the father from the first movie is looking for his kids, who were exploring an ivory poacher's truck and water wagon. As he follows the tracks, his path crosses that of the other story lines:There's a pair of scientists--Ann and Stephen--who get stranded when their light plane runs out of fuel, and two soldiers from opposing sides who are trying to capture each other.As with the first movie, the laughs come from the clash between the modern world and the primitive.The children discovering what amounts to a swimming pool (they've lived their lives in the desert, remember) is absolutely adorable, and Ann trying to defend her water supply from mischievous monkeys had me laughing aloud.Also the same as in the first movie, there's a bit of a romance--the two scientists in the plane--but this time it's played with a little more slapstick and a little less poignancy. Ann has an annoying habit of running up trees whenever anything startles her, something that's made even more slapstick because the film speeds up whenever she does so.It's a small complaint, though, and if I hadn't seen the original first, I'd likely have given this one five stars.",5,4.5 stars,1212883200,"06 8, 2008",2008,1347,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'movie', 'got', 'sequel', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'enjoyable.We', ""'re"", 'back', 'Kalahari', 'Xixo', 'father', 'first', 'movie', 'looking', 'kids', 'who', 'were', 'exploring', 'ivory', 'poacher', 'truck', 'water', 'wagon', 'tracks', 'path', 'other', 'story', 'lines', 'pair', 'scientists', 'Ann', 'Stephen', 'who', 'get', 'stranded', 'when', 'light', 'plane', 'fuel', 'two', 'soldiers', 'opposing', 'sides', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'capture', 'other.As', 'first', 'movie', 'laughs', 'come', 'clash', 'modern', 'world', 'primitive.The', 'children', 'discovering', 'what', 'amounts', 'swimming', 'pool', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'lives', 'desert', 'remember', 'absolutely', 'adorable', 'Ann', 'trying', 'defend', 'water', 'supply', 'mischievous', 'monkeys', 'had', 'laughing', 'same', 'first', 'movie', 'bit', 'romance', 'two', 'scientists', 'plane', 'time', 'played', 'little', 'more', 'slapstick', 'little', 'less', 'poignancy', 'Ann', 'annoying', 'habit', 'running', 'up', 'trees', 'anything', 'something', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'slapstick', 'film', 'up', 'whenever', 'so.It', 'small', 'complaint', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'first', ""'d"", 'likely', 'have', 'given', 'one', 'five', 'stars']",N/A
266049,AC4Z26E60FBEM,6301788559,Fr. Charles Erlandson,"[0, 0]","""The Gods Must Be Crazy 2,"" like its predecessor is a classic movie. Just recently, when looking for something that the whole family would enjoy that wasn't another Disney movie and would be appropriate even for my 6 year old, I remembered this movie. It was the perfect choice, and everyone enjoyed it on several levels.The movie involves a number of different characters who all end up getting lost and need to find their way home from the Kalahari Desert. The main character is a Bushman of the Kalahari, and he heroically goes after his 2 children as he runs day and night to follow their tracks. The movie is a comedy but the characters, their plights, and the setting in the Kalahari Desert are just as important as the humor.While the original movie is funnier and better overall, this one is also great. My kids liked some of the slapstick involving 2 soldiers who kept fighting for control of a jeep, a gun, and a hostage. Everyone in the family liked the 2 little kids who had accidentally gotten carried away on a truck, and everyone was rooting for them to be successfully found. I especially like the father of the Bushmen. He was such an honorable man who accepted his fate in life and did what he needed to do to get his kids back. Along the way he also showed kindness to others in need. To him, the ""heavy people"" (which is just about everyone else in the movie) are just plain crazy.Another thing that everyone enjoyed was the scenery of the Kalahari Desert and the animals that made appearances throughout: lions, rhinos, giraffes, baboons, hyenas, elephants, and one determined badger. The movie gave us all the sense of a different way of life which interacted with our Western culture. It's a very human film, as the people in the movie are all looking for a way home. They all end up (with one exception) being decent people, despite their differences.There's more inappropriate language than I remembered, which is unfortunate (but fortunately the 6 year old had gone to bed by most of it.)If you're looking for a different kind of family film, ""The Gods Must Be Crazy 2"" is an excellent choice.",5,Exotic and Entertaining Family Film,1312416000,"08 4, 2011",2011,2119,"['Gods', 'Must', 'Be', 'Crazy', '2', 'predecessor', 'classic', 'movie', 'Just', 'recently', 'when', 'looking', 'something', 'whole', 'family', 'would', 'enjoy', 'was', ""n't"", 'Disney', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'appropriate', 'even', '6', 'year', 'old', 'remembered', 'movie', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'everyone', 'enjoyed', 'several', 'levels.The', 'movie', 'number', 'different', 'characters', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'lost', 'need', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'Kalahari', 'Desert', 'main', 'character', 'Bushman', 'Kalahari', 'heroically', '2', 'children', 'day', 'night', 'follow', 'tracks', 'movie', 'comedy', 'characters', 'plights', 'setting', 'Kalahari', 'Desert', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'important', 'humor.While', 'original', 'movie', 'funnier', 'better', 'overall', 'one', 'also', 'great', 'kids', 'liked', 'slapstick', 'involving', '2', 'soldiers', 'who', 'kept', 'fighting', 'control', 'jeep', 'gun', 'hostage', 'Everyone', 'family', 'liked', '2', 'little', 'kids', 'who', 'had', 'accidentally', 'gotten', 'carried', 'away', 'truck', 'everyone', 'was', 'rooting', 'be', 'successfully', 'found', 'especially', 'father', 'Bushmen', 'was', 'such', 'honorable', 'man', 'who', 'accepted', 'fate', 'life', 'did', 'what', 'needed', 'do', 'get', 'kids', 'back', 'way', 'also', 'showed', 'kindness', 'others', 'need', 'heavy', 'people', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'crazy.Another', 'thing', 'everyone', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'scenery', 'Kalahari', 'Desert', 'animals', 'made', 'appearances', 'lions', 'rhinos', 'giraffes', 'baboons', 'hyenas', 'elephants', 'one', 'determined', 'badger', 'movie', 'gave', 'sense', 'different', 'way', 'life', 'interacted', 'Western', 'culture', 'very', 'human', 'film', 'people', 'movie', 'are', 'looking', 'way', 'home', 'end', 'up', 'one', 'exception', 'being', 'decent', 'people', 'more', 'inappropriate', 'language', 'remembered', 'unfortunate', 'fortunately', '6', 'year', 'old', 'had', 'gone', 'bed', 'most', ""'re"", 'looking', 'different', 'kind', 'family', 'film', 'Gods', 'Must', 'Be', 'Crazy', '2', 'excellent', 'choice']",N/A

The two children's curiosity finds them on top of the water wagon being pulled by a ivory pouches truck. Xixo, reads the tracks, interprets that his children are captives of the truck, and begins his run. Xixo, will cross paths with Anne, a Cuban, a African militant, a delirious Stephen, and briefly be detained by the two poachers.Jack convinces Dr. Ann Taylor to take a short air tour of the Kalahari in a rotary powered glider; Jack does not know that a violent storm is forming, but does comment that the storm does not look good. Jack lands the plane in the reserve and Dr. Stephen Marshall takes possession of the plane and Dr Ann Taylor remains his passenger. A storm does not cause the crash landing, instead, it is the fact Stephen runs out of fuel. After which he must land in the tops of a prehistoric looking tree. Marshall disassembles the plane, lowers the parts, and reassembles the plane on the ground. Ann discovers that Rhinos have the strange behavior of stomping out fire when they see it. After spotting Hyenas, Ann becomes scared but Stephen tells her, ""if you ignore them, they will ignore you."" And additionally explains that hyenas are scared of animals that are taller than them and when sleeping humans are not a threat and the hyenas will take a chunk out of them while they sleep. So Stephen sleeps first and Ann second. Ann will distract a Male guardian ostrich and Stephen will steal an ostrich egg for food, but not before the Ostrich engages him in a chase, but fortunately for Stephan a monkey will move into the nest and distract the Ostrich.The director likes the comedy where, at least three times, Ann has her dress above her head exposing herself. Unfortunate, considering these indiscretions appease a carnal appetite but threaten to ruin a perfect movie. Ann runs up trees on almost every sound; and Ann must outsmart a group of Gorillas for a drink of water.After stepping on a badger-like creature, the animal becomes entrenched on revenge seeking to bite the boot that step on him; Marshall gives up his boot and the animal gnaws voraciously on the leather bindings; Marshall accidentally steps on the animal again and the animal bites one of the tires of the glider. Improvising a strange solution, Marshall stomps out the bottom portion of the passenger side of the glider and lifts the glider while managing too run with it while Ann navigates takeoff; Stephen falls out of the glider and Ann, who lacks piloting skills flies away; eventually Ann stops the engine, ejects the emergency parachute, and lands deep in the Kalahari.Stephen start to walk in the direction Ann departed but realizes he needs his boot too cross the desert; Stephen tricks the badger like animal to release its grip on the boot for some ostrich egg; Stephen is stung by a black scorpion; Stephen and the badger like animal begin walking across the desert. Anne is capture first by the Cuban, whom it taken captive by the African National, whom both are brought under control by Anne. Stephen is rescue by Xixo, after collapsing in the desert; Xixo buries Stephen up to his neck in sand; Xixo, Ann, the Cuban, and the African National join. Xixo finds the truck but no children, who have managed to get off the truck at different times; the children are hundreds of miles away from home. Xixo will find the truck and he will ask the poacher, if they have seen his children; the poacher will not understand his language; the poachers want no witnesses of their illegal ivory escapades; the Two poacher will capture Xixo and bind him with cords.Stephen, Ann, the Cuban, and African national will be captured by the two poachers along with Xixo. The first poacher will shoot himself in the foot; the group tied up two together will attempt an escape from the first poacher; the second poacher will see the escape attempt and return from the hill he was at where he was attempting radio contact with headquarters; the second poacher will start a fire; Xixo will defeat the fire trap initiated by the second poacher with a burnout; Stephen will trick the second poacher and gain control.

Returning with the same cast of African actors and a new set of white ones, this movie again looks at what happens when bushmen from the Kalahari venture out and encounter ""civilization"".  This time Xixo, our father from the previous movie, goes of to find his two children, who have accidentally stowed away on a poacher's truck.  Along the way, he encounters two soldiers trying to capture each other, a white lady from the city that is trying to get back to the city, and the park ranger infatuated with her.  Part of the story tracks the two children, and their adventures with a large water tank, a gun, and a hungry hyena.  All in all, this movie is just as funny as the first one, if not funnier.

What matters most here in my opinion is the incredible way the film impresses on anyone who sees it.  The multiple parallels are worthy of a dissertation, the strength of the human species is breath taking, the cerebral state of knowing is phenomenial, and most of all the humor is self depreciating (to both cultures) while at the same time giving belly laughs over and over and over each time you watch it.

The !Kung of the Kalihari desert are discovering their millenia of isolation eroding by intrusion from the white world. In the first film it was a discarded Coke bottle.  Here, it's poachers and a quirky aircraft.  Lena Farguia turns in a fine performance as a New York lawyer dropped [literally] into the !Kung's world.  Her instant rapport with N!xau, who's seeking his two children was a highlight of the film.  An even greater sequence is her dealings with two soldiers on opposing sides of the Zaire civil war.  The introduction of one as a Cuban mercaneray was an inspired idea, and the actor.While this film doesn't have the innovative impact of the first [a Land Rover in a tree? ] it has the advantage of not being a 'sequel' with its attendant weaknesses.
