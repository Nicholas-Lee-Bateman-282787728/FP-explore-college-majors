1115812,A1RHXX7KBBQSFF,B000Y11BBW,MammaJamma,"[0, 2]","It took me til 2010 to finally see this film.  It's a very good study in human relationships, but not much on human-horse issues.  A few, just not much.  What happens at the very end to subdue the horse, is what Robert Redford's character should have done at the very beginning!It runs too long, that's a bit of a bore.  And the horse is traumatized by the girl, not a situation, which I found very odd.  She didn't do anything to traumatize him, they were involved in an accident.  He would not have associated that with her, she would be a comfort image for him, so that was askew.Girl's mother is a strange bird, the Daddy is very dull.  No wonder Robert Redford's character looks so attractive.Despite the length & the misfirings on the animal-human connection, it's a watchable & entertaining movie.  Scenery is breathtaking.",4,Very good movie,1297123200,"02 8, 2011",2011,830,"['took', 'til', '2010', 'finally', 'see', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'study', 'human', 'relationships', 'not', 'much', 'human-horse', 'issues', 'few', 'just', 'not', 'much', 'What', 'very', 'end', 'subdue', 'horse', 'what', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'character', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'very', 'beginning', 'too', 'long', 'bit', 'bore', 'horse', 'traumatized', 'girl', 'not', 'situation', 'found', 'very', 'odd', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'traumatize', 'were', 'involved', 'accident', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'associated', 'would', 'be', 'comfort', 'image', 'was', 'askew.Girl', 'mother', 'strange', 'bird', 'Daddy', 'very', 'dull', 'wonder', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'character', 'so', 'attractive.Despite', 'length', 'misfirings', 'animal-human', 'connection', 'watchable', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'Scenery', 'breathtaking']",The Horse Whisperer / Mr. Holland's Opus
