While their showing of the places made famous by vlad the impaler,and bram's stoker's dracula was good,the video needed more. Yes,it can be said that the story of the female countess that bathed in blood was interesting.But,unfortunately,they talked about it over and over again. Some other stories of so called real vampires would have been better. Also,they mention diseases that have some characteristics of vampire lore,but seemed to pass right over that portion of the show. No secrets at all in this and any even casual vampire fan knows all this stuff. If I were you,I'd pass it by unless your a novice to vampires.",2,what secrets?,1347926400,"09 18, 2012",2012,656,"['was', 'disappointed', 'video', 'showing', 'places', 'made', 'famous', 'vlad', 'impaler', 'bram', 'stoker', 'dracula', 'was', 'good', 'video', 'needed', 'more', 'Yes', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'story', 'female', 'countess', 'bathed', 'blood', 'was', 'interesting.But', 'unfortunately', 'talked', 'over', 'again', 'other', 'stories', 'so', 'called', 'real', 'vampires', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Also', 'mention', 'diseases', 'have', 'characteristics', 'vampire', 'lore', 'seemed', 'pass', 'right', 'portion', 'show', 'secrets', 'even', 'casual', 'vampire', 'fan', 'stuff', 'were', ""'d"", 'pass', 'novice', 'vampires']",N/A

1219038,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B001N3OCX4,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[5, 7]","""Vampire Secrets""  is a timely documentary in light of two recent theatrical films based on the vampire -- ""Twilight"" and ""Let the Right One In.""  It shows how history, nature, literature, cinema, and legend combined to produce the concept of the vampire, a creature of the undead who survives on the blood of human beings.  The 1997 Bram Stoker novel ""Dracula"" is cited as a major influence in the popularity of the vampire character.  The aristocratic Count Dracula requires a human slave to look after his coffin and protect him from exposure to daylight.  He leaves his Transylvanian castle to journey to London, its dense population an ideal feeding ground.  But the documentary goes further back, uncovering the ancient folkloric origins of blood-craving creatures from beyond the grave.  The vampire myth is traced to Eastern Europe and back to the ancient cultures of Greece and China.  Profusely illustrated with art and footage of actual locations, ""Vampire Secrets"" is a treat for anyone who ever shuddered watching a vampire flick.",3,"The Vampire of Legend, History, Literature, and Film",1240704000,"04 26, 2009",2009,1043,"['Vampire', 'Secrets', 'timely', 'documentary', 'light', 'two', 'recent', 'theatrical', 'films', 'based', 'vampire', 'Twilight', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'how', 'history', 'nature', 'literature', 'cinema', 'legend', 'combined', 'produce', 'concept', 'vampire', 'creature', 'undead', 'who', 'blood', 'human', 'beings', '1997', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'Dracula', 'cited', 'major', 'influence', 'popularity', 'vampire', 'character', 'aristocratic', 'Count', 'Dracula', 'human', 'slave', 'look', 'coffin', 'protect', 'exposure', 'daylight', 'Transylvanian', 'castle', 'journey', 'London', 'dense', 'population', 'ideal', 'feeding', 'ground', 'documentary', 'further', 'back', 'uncovering', 'ancient', 'folkloric', 'origins', 'blood-craving', 'creatures', 'grave', 'vampire', 'myth', 'traced', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'back', 'ancient', 'cultures', 'Greece', 'China', 'Profusely', 'illustrated', 'art', 'footage', 'actual', 'locations', 'Vampire', 'Secrets', 'treat', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'shuddered', 'watching', 'vampire', 'flick']",N/A
