Yellowstone in 3-D? Of course I want it! But, as some others have mentioned, one of the primary and elementary rules of shooting 3-D that I learned in the '50s with my Stereo-Realist camera is that you should have objects in the foreground to accentuate the 3-D. Aside from that, angle shots and other routine photographer and cinematographer tricks of the trade keep visual interest alive, even in a place as surfeited with beauty and wonder as Yellowstone. They  seem not to understand how to use the camera. Similarly, their Papua 3D--The Secret Island of the Cannibals, lacks the same skills and reuses footage in a place where there is so much more to see!This title is not awful beyond words, it's just a pale shadow of what someone with a decent 3-D camera  and the required professional skill could do in a scenic wonder rife with so much possibility. I won't buy any more of their titles until I've seen a lot of positive reviews indicating they've gone to school and learned how to shoot a documentary.I won't criticize the narrator, but they needed someone with a livelier voice and an apparent interest in the subject. Perhaps he was lulled into a hypnotic state by the flute and tom-toms that, used more sparingly, would have been quite  effective.And not to have shown even one eruption of Old Faithful???

The narration would be laughable if it weren't so dull and lifeless.  The narrator (sounding a bit like a computer-generated voice) often gets pronunciations wrong.  At least once I heard him say, ""Yeelowstone"", and that's just one of many examples.  The video, while it looks good, is nothing more than static shots of landscape.  You do get movement within the shots (animals eating in a field, bubbling pools, etc.) but not once does the camera move, so much of the time it's just a few seconds of a near-photograph.  It gets better.  The one thing that Yellowstone is most-known for, the Old Faithful Geyser, isn't even mentioned.The 3D effects often look good but it's literally like looking at a 3D photograph so you'll get some depth of field but with a non-moving camera, you're not getting what you think you are.The back of the case lists a running time of 62 minutes when it's actually only 50 minutes.  Halfway through, and it's a chore to finish it, I jokingly said to my friends that this is so embarrassing poor that I was sure several people involved insisted on leaving their names out of the credits.  When it was over, there were only four names in the closing credits.  Four.
