1113695,A37S3ACL57LN62,B000XA5K0M,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[4, 4]","At first I thought The Doll was just going to be a curiosity. The opening looks very juvenile with a cardboard constructed set and dolls that come to life to begin telling the story. It eases into a more traditional film about the nephew of a wealthy man who is unmarried. The wealthy man is dying and he wants his bloodline to continue, so he encourages his nephew to marry. However, the nephew does not want to marry and tries to hide in a monastery. When the uncle offers a large dowry, the monks convince the nephew to pretend to marry a lifelike doll to inherit the money. At the doll-maker's house, the doll which is based on the doll-maker's daughter is broken, so the daughter steps in to cover the mistake. It is a cute and original story which was more entertaining and less childish than I expected it to be.Fans of Ernst Lubitsch will be delighted to see a different kind of story from him. The characters are innocent types and the few references to sex are minor and tame compared to some of his American films. Instead we get a movie for all ages.",3,Lubitsch Plays With Dolls,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,1062,"['first', 'thought', 'Doll', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'be', 'curiosity', 'opening', 'very', 'juvenile', 'cardboard', 'constructed', 'set', 'dolls', 'come', 'life', 'begin', 'telling', 'story', 'more', 'traditional', 'film', 'nephew', 'wealthy', 'man', 'who', 'unmarried', 'wealthy', 'man', 'dying', 'bloodline', 'continue', 'nephew', 'marry', 'However', 'nephew', 'not', 'want', 'marry', 'tries', 'hide', 'monastery', 'When', 'uncle', 'large', 'dowry', 'monks', 'convince', 'nephew', 'pretend', 'marry', 'lifelike', 'doll', 'inherit', 'money', 'doll-maker', 'house', 'doll', 'based', 'doll-maker', 'daughter', 'broken', 'daughter', 'steps', 'cover', 'mistake', 'cute', 'original', 'story', 'was', 'more', 'entertaining', 'less', 'childish', 'expected', 'be.Fans', 'Ernst', 'Lubitsch', 'will', 'be', 'delighted', 'see', 'different', 'kind', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'innocent', 'types', 'few', 'references', 'sex', 'are', 'minor', 'tame', 'compared', 'American', 'films', 'Instead', 'get', 'movie', 'ages']",N/A
