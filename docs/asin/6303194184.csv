362361,A12P84EGJD4JVX,6303194184,Edith Biggar,"[0, 0]","I got this movie, first because it was a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie & second, because I like both the leading actors/actresses - James Garner & Joanne Woodward.  I don't know who James Garner is married to; but, I do know Joanne Woodward is Paul Newman's wife.  Actually, Paul & James have similar demeanors.  Perhaps, that's why this couple seems to have so much ""chemistry"".  The whole stoy of this movie happens one Saturday, starting with the couple getting ready to take a couple hour road-trip for a funeral of Maggie's best friend's husband.  From start to finish, the day is filled with comedy & friendly bickering of an ""old-married-couple"".  The viewer is introduced to three incidental family members: a college-bound daughter, older son - a ""biker-dude"" with torn-out knees in jeans & long-hair.  The first incident in their day happens when the wife walks to the auto-body shop to pick up their car, which had been repaired following an accident. Ira's father lives upstairs from his frame shop & the viewer is briefly introduced to him as well.  As Maggie is pulling out of the body shop, onto the street, she will declare her ex-daughter-in-law's voice is heard on the car radio. ""Bang"", the car is struck in the front passenger-side quarter-panel by a large utility truck.  The day goes on from that incident, visiting a cafe for coffee & a map so that Ira can determine his driving route.  Lots of personal information is exchanged by Maggie & the waitress.  I think of one of my home-care clients, when there were several women out in the dinette chatting, he would say ""la cockarone, la cockarone"", rough Italian equivalent of ""the chickens (clucking)"".  Ira & Maggie arrive at the church with no body else in sight.  As they are waiting, Ira pulls out a deck of playing cards & starts a game of Solitare.  Soon, however the widow, played by Joyce Van Patten, arrives at the church & hands Ira a large floral arrangement & takes Maggie outside for a little friendly chat.  The rest of the congregation arrive soon afterwards & it is the strangest memomorial service this viewer has ever seen!  Various congregants are asked to sing some love song or another.  Maggie begins to sing ""Love is a Many Spleandored Thing"", soon accompanied by the man sitting on her left - some other friend of Maggie's.  Soon, the funeral is over & the congregation appears at the home of the recently departed & his widow.  Ira is found in the bedroom, setting up another game of Solitare.  Maggie finds him & accidentally falls backward onto the water-bed!  They are laughing & having fun & the widow finds them & ""throws them out"".  Maggie suggests to Ira that they stop & visit thier ex-daughter-in-law & granddaughter Leroy.  On the way, Paul Winfield is driving erratically & Maggie lies to him that his wheel is in danger of falling off the car, and they end-up taking him to a garage where a family member of his runs the tow-truck.  They arrive at Fiona & Leroy's home & Fiona's mother returns shortly from grocery shopping.  Ira & Leroy play a game of catch with the baseball.  Maggie has talked Fiona & Leroy into coming back to Baltimore with them.  Their son Jesse comes to the house, knowing his ex is going to be there (Maggie calls him from the bedroom phone at Fiona's place).  The reunion lasts all of about five minutes & Jesse ""hits-the-road"", followed shortly after by Fiona & Leroy.  Following supper, the college-bound daughter is still packing & Mom has brought a cup of frozen yoguart for each her & the daughter.  ""no Thanks"", says daughter & Maggie goes to bedroom.  Yet again, Ira has a Solitare game going.  She ""butts-in"" on his game & he eats some of the dessert & comments ""hey, this is actually pretty good"".  Screen fades to black & end credits roll.  In about an hour & a half, the viewer is shown one waking-day in the life of Ira & Maggie.i like movies like this, once in awhile - a ""day in the life of - somebody"".  It makes me realize I'm not so much different from the rest of humanity, at least in middle-class America!Hallmark consistently sets the standard for what ""movies ought to be like"" - a good story, very little swearing, very little overt violence, very little overt sexuality.  If some of those are needed a swear word or two is sufficient.  If sex is part of the story, it's either referred to in dialog or just a quick scene.  Violence is handles the same way.  And the story is told in about 100 minutes, give or take.",4,"They sure do look married, even tho' I know, in real-life, they aren't",1286323200,"10 6, 2010",2010,4473,"['got', 'movie', 'first', 'was', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'movie', 'second', 'like', 'leading', 'actors/actresses', 'James', 'Garner', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'James', 'Garner', 'married', 'do', 'know', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'wife', 'Actually', 'Paul', 'James', 'have', 'similar', 'demeanors', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'couple', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'chemistry', 'whole', 'stoy', 'movie', 'one', 'Saturday', 'starting', 'couple', 'getting', 'ready', 'take', 'couple', 'hour', 'road-trip', 'funeral', 'Maggie', 'best', 'friend', 'husband', 'start', 'finish', 'day', 'filled', 'comedy', 'friendly', 'bickering', 'old-married-couple', 'viewer', 'introduced', 'three', 'incidental', 'family', 'members', 'college-bound', 'daughter', 'older', 'son', 'biker-dude', 'torn-out', 'knees', 'jeans', 'long-hair', 'first', 'incident', 'day', 'when', 'wife', 'walks', 'auto-body', 'shop', 'pick', 'up', 'car', 'had', 'been', 'repaired', 'following', 'accident', 'Ira', 'father', 'upstairs', 'frame', 'shop', 'viewer', 'briefly', 'introduced', 'as', 'well', 'Maggie', 'pulling', 'body', 'shop', 'street', 'will', 'declare', 'ex-daughter-in-law', 'voice', 'heard', 'car', 'radio', 'Bang', 'car', 'struck', 'front', 'passenger-side', 'quarter-panel', 'large', 'utility', 'truck', 'day', 'incident', 'visiting', 'cafe', 'coffee', 'map', 'Ira', 'can', 'determine', 'driving', 'route', 'Lots', 'personal', 'information', 'exchanged', 'Maggie', 'waitress', 'think', 'one', 'home-care', 'clients', 'when', 'were', 'several', 'women', 'out', 'dinette', 'chatting', 'would', 'say', 'la', 'cockarone', 'la', 'cockarone', 'rough', 'Italian', 'equivalent', 'chickens', 'clucking', 'Ira', 'Maggie', 'arrive', 'church', 'body', 'else', 'sight', 'are', 'waiting', 'Ira', 'out', 'deck', 'playing', 'cards', 'game', 'Solitare', 'Soon', 'however', 'widow', 'played', 'Joyce', 'Van', 'Patten', 'church', 'hands', 'large', 'floral', 'arrangement', 'Maggie', 'outside', 'little', 'friendly', 'chat', 'rest', 'congregation', 'arrive', 'soon', 'afterwards', 'strangest', 'memomorial', 'service', 'viewer', 'ever', 'seen', 'Various', 'congregants', 'are', 'asked', 'sing', 'love', 'song', 'Maggie', 'sing', 'Love', 'Many', 'Spleandored', 'Thing', 'soon', 'accompanied', 'man', 'sitting', 'left', 'other', 'friend', 'Maggie', 'Soon', 'funeral', 'congregation', 'home', 'recently', 'departed', 'widow', 'Ira', 'found', 'bedroom', 'setting', 'up', 'game', 'Solitare', 'Maggie', 'accidentally', 'backward', 'water-bed', 'are', 'laughing', 'having', 'fun', 'widow', 'out', 'Maggie', 'Ira', 'stop', 'visit', 'thier', 'ex-daughter-in-law', 'granddaughter', 'Leroy', 'way', 'Paul', 'Winfield', 'driving', 'erratically', 'Maggie', 'wheel', 'danger', 'falling', 'off', 'car', 'end-up', 'taking', 'garage', 'where', 'family', 'member', 'tow-truck', 'arrive', 'Fiona', 'Leroy', 'home', 'Fiona', 'mother', 'returns', 'shortly', 'grocery', 'shopping', 'Ira', 'Leroy', 'play', 'game', 'catch', 'baseball', 'Maggie', 'talked', 'Fiona', 'Leroy', 'coming', 'back', 'Baltimore', 'son', 'Jesse', 'house', 'knowing', 'ex', 'going', 'be', 'there', 'Maggie', 'bedroom', 'phone', 'Fiona', 'place', 'reunion', 'five', 'minutes', 'Jesse', 'hits-the-road', 'followed', 'shortly', 'Fiona', 'Leroy', 'Following', 'supper', 'college-bound', 'daughter', 'still', 'packing', 'Mom', 'brought', 'cup', 'frozen', 'yoguart', 'daughter', 'Thanks', 'daughter', 'Maggie', 'bedroom', 'again', 'Ira', 'Solitare', 'game', 'going', 'butts-in', 'game', 'dessert', 'comments', 'hey', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'Screen', 'black', 'end', 'credits', 'roll', 'hour', 'half', 'viewer', 'shown', 'one', 'waking-day', 'life', 'Ira', 'Maggie.i', 'movies', 'once', 'awhile', 'day', 'life', 'somebody', 'realize', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'much', 'different', 'rest', 'humanity', 'least', 'middle-class', 'America', 'Hallmark', 'consistently', 'standard', 'what', 'movies', 'ought', 'be', 'good', 'story', 'very', 'little', 'swearing', 'very', 'little', 'overt', 'violence', 'very', 'little', 'overt', 'sexuality', 'are', 'needed', 'swear', 'word', 'two', 'sufficient', 'sex', 'part', 'story', 'referred', 'dialog', 'just', 'quick', 'scene', 'Violence', 'same', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'about', '100', 'minutes', 'give', 'take']",Breathing Lessons VHS

362369,A2X25C107CSLOR,6303194184,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[26, 29]","This Hallmark Hall of Fame TVM is an adaptation of the Pulitzer prize-winning novel by AnneTyler about a Baltimore married couple who travel to a friend's funeral. We're in road movie territory with James Garner and Joanne Woodward bickering along the way. The bickering is of the amusing variety because of the skill of both actors, the tone set by director John Erman and music by Broadway composer John Kander. Although Garner has a non-threatening manner, it's funny to see how Woodward as a dithery eccentric infuriates him. Woodward reminded me a little of Shirley Booth in Come Back Little Sheba, but without the dog. Garner says she &quot;believes the people she loves are better than they are&quot; which explains her romantic quest to rejoin her divorced son with his ditzy ex-wife, Kathyrn Erbe, in a performance as strong as Garner and Woodward. Woodward has an hysterical turn when she is called upon to sing Love is a Many Splendid Thing at the funeral, and gets a good line at Garner with &quot;You and reality oughta go steady&quot;, which is also a little Blanche DeBois &quot;I don't want realism. I want magic&quot;. In smaller roles are Joyce Van Patten as the funeral's widow, and Eileen Heckart who comes off a little better as a diner waitress (though Garner upstages her with his looks of disdain at Woodward's openness with her). Paul Winfield is also in a few scenes where he is the victim of Woodward's road rage.",4,Tylerland,984528000,"03 14, 2001",2001,1440,"['Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'TVM', 'adaptation', 'Pulitzer', 'prize-winning', 'novel', 'AnneTyler', 'Baltimore', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'travel', 'friend', 'funeral', ""'re"", 'road', 'movie', 'territory', 'James', 'Garner', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'bickering', 'way', 'bickering', 'amusing', 'variety', 'skill', 'actors', 'tone', 'set', 'director', 'John', 'Erman', 'music', 'Broadway', 'composer', 'John', 'Kander', 'Garner', 'non-threatening', 'manner', 'funny', 'see', 'how', 'Woodward', 'dithery', 'eccentric', 'Woodward', 'reminded', 'little', 'Shirley', 'Booth', 'Come', 'Back', 'Little', 'Sheba', 'dog', 'Garner', 'quot', 'people', 'are', 'better', 'are', 'quot', 'romantic', 'quest', 'rejoin', 'divorced', 'son', 'ditzy', 'ex-wife', 'Kathyrn', 'Erbe', 'performance', 'as', 'strong', 'Garner', 'Woodward', 'Woodward', 'hysterical', 'turn', 'when', 'called', 'sing', 'Love', 'Many', 'Splendid', 'Thing', 'funeral', 'good', 'line', 'Garner', 'quot', 'reality', 'oughta', 'go', 'steady', 'quot', 'also', 'little', 'Blanche', 'DeBois', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'realism', 'want', 'magic', 'quot', 'smaller', 'roles', 'are', 'Joyce', 'Van', 'Patten', 'funeral', 'widow', 'Eileen', 'Heckart', 'who', 'off', 'little', 'better', 'diner', 'waitress', 'Garner', 'looks', 'disdain', 'Woodward', 'openness', 'Paul', 'Winfield', 'also', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'victim', 'Woodward', 'road', 'rage']",Breathing Lessons VHS
