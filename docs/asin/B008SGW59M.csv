Was it snowy?  It looked fake to me.  The audience sitting around round tables watching in rather light clothing didn't appear to be cold at all.After every song, the orchestra stands up to accept their applause.  I never saw that before.  (every single song!)  The between song patter was really hokey and long winded.  Also the staged scenes of children playing were ridiculous.  The young daughter of one of the orchestra ladies was just ok with her ballet, and when they cg'd her ""flight"" we almost turned it off.The orchestra, chorus, and soloist were very good though.Then come the second half of the show inside a beautiful old church.

And Andre always makes his concerts so exciting. The concert began at his castle in his winter garden and was completed in a cathedral across the street from his home. Andre invites you into his home and makes you feel very welcome.His version of &#34;Walking in the Air&#34; with the ten year old Rosa dancing in the air was incredible. The acoustics in the cathedral were phenomenal. Besides his orchestra, the men's choir, and children's choir accompanied him on many songs at the cathedral. The Hallelujah was so awesome, it could have been sung in heaven. The last song, Silent Night was precious and holy; again, just beautiful. If you could own only one Christmas DVD, this would be the one to get.
