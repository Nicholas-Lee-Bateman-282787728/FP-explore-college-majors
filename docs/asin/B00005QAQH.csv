In terms of entertainment, it even beats Harry Potter and Planet of the Apes.  Of course, it's supposed to be that way, seeing as it's a comedy, but still.. I had more fun watching this than either of the aforementioned two.The integration between the live-acting and the animation is near-seamless.  The whole thing flows with ease.. unless one happens to be watching the live actors.  Perhaps one enjoys the animation more after watching the pathetic character castings.  I certainly couldn't sympathize with Frank (Bill Murray's character) and even his attempt at the end to make up for his blase acting is too little, too late.  However, Thrax was awesomely played.. he literally sent shivers up my spine from the moment he first began speaking.  Jones and Drix pull together well, and serve as perfect bouncing boards for each other's personality.  For those hoping that this movie will have children coming away with a greater understanding of the workings of the human body, this movie will come as a disappointment.

Inside his body live animated blood cells. One, a cop named Osmosis Jones (voiced by Chris Rock) decides to try and save Murray by challenging the orders of his superior (voiced by William Shatner) and give Murray the chance to turn his life around. The movie also features the voice talents of Brandy, Larry Fishburne, Ron Howard and David Hyde-Pierce. Kid Rock also makes an appearance in animated form as Kidney Rock.OSMOSIS JONES is a movie all ages ought to enjoy, even if the animation is a bit iffy at times, but in general it's a clever, humorous piece of entertainment with Rock and Hyde-Pierce (as Jones's partner) providing excellent voice performances. As with SHREK, the character animation vaguely resembles the actors. Larry Fishburne is especially effective and menacing as the bad guy. I would also advise viewers not to eat during the movie as there is a rather low rent mucus gag and an amusing zit gag.

674325,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00005QAQH,Caleb Williams,"[0, 1]","I first came across this a couple of years ago when it was being shown on the Cartoon Network station in the UK. I'm a big kid at heart, so I thought I would give this a shot. I have to admit, from what I remember I enjoyed it immensely back then. So after going a few years without seeing it, I decided to take the leap and buy it to watch one more time. I have to say that I loved it even more the second time around. I became shocked to find out that this is even a Farrelly brothers production, which gave it that extra comedic boost. The Farrellys famed for comedy classics like Dumb & Dumber and There's something about Mary.I have seen many reviews with the main negativities being it was either a gross out movie or it was too graphic. Sure, the cartoons show cells being killed in what some would say is quite a brutal way, but that's the realism shining through I guess. If you're going to make an animated movie based around a killer virus, then it's inevitable that you're going to see cells die. For those who have kids, this is a good way to teach them the realities of life and that not everything is all smiles and sunshine. I don't know, I guess people like their kids to live in a delusional world where everything is A-OK. The gross out scenes, I have to admit became a bit too much even for me. I have a thing for snot and the whole snorting and swallowing thing, so I did skip through that particular scene. There's not doubt that the particular scene in question had a point to it when viewing the animated interior. Another thing that bugged me about the negative reviews was the acknowledgement of innuendo, citing that it's inappropriate. How is innuendo inappropriate? Unless your child is aware of what the innuendo is referring to or the negative reviewer has a dirty mind themselves, then there truly is nothing wrong with a little adult innuendo in a kids movie. A lot of kids TV shows and movies have the odd adult joke here and there, that float harmlessly over the kids head and give the adult a cheap chuckle.The story focuses around two entities and tells us two separate stories in one fantastic movie. The animated side focuses around Osmosis Jones, a loser white blood cell cop in the city of Frank. One day after Frank swallows an infected boiled egg, he contracts the deadly Red Death virus which embarks on a mission to kill Frank. Determined to prove his worth and after discovering the Red Death virus, Osmosis must fight against the mayors and his departments wishes to locate and stop the virus. He does get a little help from a cold pill by the name of Drexel, who becomes known as Drix. He's uptight and does everything by the book, at least he did until he met officer Jones.On the outside we are given Frank, a slob zoo worker who's really let himself go since he lost his wife. The only people he has left are his brother Bob (Equally slob like) and his daughter Shane. After eating the boiled egg that was dropped in Monkey poop, he slowly deteriorates, but is determined not to go the hospital or the doctors as he wants to make it to the Buffalo Chicken Wing Festival.This movie is stocked full of really big names such as Chris Rock, Laurence Fishburne, Bill Murray, Ron Howard, William Shatner and even a cameo by Kid Rock. How can you honestly go wrong with a movie with such a cast. This is a really enjoyable film that I think can be enjoyed by the entire family.

It is about a lonely white blood cell named Osmosis Jones (played by kid rock) who is on a body wide search of a suspect virus that no one believes he has seen.  Drex (David Hyde Pierce) is the fast talking, proper cold aid who, after seeing the commitment Jones has, joins him in the search for Thrax (Lawrence Fishburn).

674328,A12SHC9IT3VZQG,B00005QAQH,Daniel Sweeney,"[1, 6]","...this movie was a huge mistake. The audience I saw it with was largely quiet and seemed as uninvolved in it as I was. About the only thing going for it is the vocal talent (Rock, Fishburne, Pierce, Shatner) but even that ended up being disappointing.The concept just doesn't work. There's a major disconnect between the live action sequences with Frank (Bill Murray) in the real world (which make up perhaps 1/3 of the movie) and the animated sequences of what's going on inside his body. For me, this very cartoony anthropomorphic world of his internal organisms (the animation design reminds me of the Simpsons a little bit) just cannot possibly exist at all in the real world...yet we are supposed to believe that Frank's white blood cells look like Smurf/Bart Simpson hybrids and sound like Chris Rock...it was just impossible for me to suspend my disbelief as the film cuts back and forth between these two completely different universes.That said, I guess the filmmakers do what they can with it, the way they visualize the city of Frank (the inhabitants refer to his brain as Cerebellum Hall, the armpits are where all of the evil bacteria and viruses hang out and veins are shown as busy highways) is somewhat clever but, again, entirely too fantastic to exist in the real world. And then when these wholly disparate worlds collide, and the animated micro-organisms are literally travelling from one person to another AND THEN BACK AGAIN via phlegm and tears in the real world...well, that's when the impossible becomes TOTALLY LUDICROUS.And it doesn't help that all of the live-action actors (notably Murray, Molly Shannon and Chris Elliott) appear to just be collecting paychecks. Murray has achieved a new low here...I enjoyed his recent turns in `Rushmore' and `Charlie's Angels' but this is just plain embarrassing for him. The Farrelly brothers just must've told him to be as disgusting and slovenly as possible, which is fine I guess but that's all he has to do in this and what a waste of his talent. And the result is we just don't care about his character...he's repugnant and an idiot. So what if the Thrax (the virus) causes him to die? The audience feels no sympathy towards Murray and that is the fatal flaw of the film.And really, I expected more of Rock...there are a couple of scenes where it looks like he was able to improvise and do his thing but for the most part the filmmakers keep him on a pretty short leash and stick to the script, and I really think that an opportunity may have been missed there. Used properly, I think Rock could do great voice-overs for animated films.Oh yeah, one more thing...why can't a comedic film come out without some dumb film parody in it? You've seen the action in the Matrix parodied a million times already...well add another attempt (very feeble at that) to the list. It's really getting annoying, and pedestrian animated films like this one really have no new insights to add as far as that parody goes. They should leave that to more insightful programs such as Simpsons and South Park.One final note...I had this weird feeling when I walked out of the theater...as if the film just didn't work, and I knew the movie reminded me of another, but I couldn't remember what at first. Then it came to me...remember `The Last Action Hero'? That film left me with that same feeling, because Arnold Schwarzenneggar plays the role of a movie character that comes to life in the real world. It was just totally impossible to believe and renders the film - no matter how well it's done and how well everything else is conceived - toothless. And Osmosis Jones falls flat for the same reason.

It actually wasn't until several years after the movie was released that I finally got around to seeing it. So what is this movie all about?The movie switches between animation and live action. All the fully animated parts take place within Frank's body. Germs, pills, and white blood cells are anthromorphic creatures who walk and talk like any human. The white blood cells are what run the processes of the body.The titular character, Osmosis Jones, is such a white blood cell. In the movie, Osmosis, played by Chris Rock, is a police officer (some are firefighters, the mayor, scientists, etc.). He lives in what's referred to inside the body as the City of Frank. Frank, the live action version, is played by Bill Murray and is a zookeeper. Frank is a widowed and ever-disgusting slob and father of a daughter. His daughter, Shane, played by Elena Franklin, is the exact opposite and is a very health-oriented person who is trying to get her father to change his lifestyle.In the beginning, a monkey steals an egg from Frank. Getting it back, Frank then eats the germed-up egg which allows a deadly virus named Thrax (Laurence Fishburne) to get inside him. Thrax's plan is to kill Frank within three days all the while making it look like the common cold to fool doctors and the citizens of Frank.However, Osmosis learns of the truth after the mayor gets Frank to take a cold pill, introducing the other main character of the duo, Drix (David Hyde Pierce). Unfortunately, no one believes Osmosis and Drix leaving them to stop Thrax on their own.Being a nearly 25 year old guy, I could almost say the movie is a guilty pleasure of mine. While it's not an Oscar-winning movie, I always found it to be pretty enjoyable. It's simply a fun kind of movie.Another thing that's pretty nice is that, while generally a movie for kids, it does have some humor that would fly right over the heads of most children. Like during one scene, a statue can be seen with a plaque reading ""Our Founder"".The statue is a sperm cell.So there's humor for everyone.Is the movie worth checking out? I would say yes, if you love light-hearted and simple fun movies. The great thing is that there was even a follow-up animated series, so if you want to know what happens to Osmosis and Drix, you can always check that out.",4,Too Bad It Doesn't Really Work Like This,1296345600,"01 30, 2011",2011,2387,"['was', 'introduced', 'universe', 'Osmosis', 'Jones', 'initially', 'animated', 'series', 'actually', 'was', ""n't"", 'several', 'years', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'finally', 'got', 'seeing', 'what', 'movie', 'movie', 'animation', 'live', 'action', 'fully', 'animated', 'parts', 'take', 'place', 'Frank', 'body', 'Germs', 'pills', 'white', 'blood', 'cells', 'are', 'anthromorphic', 'creatures', 'who', 'walk', 'talk', 'human', 'white', 'blood', 'cells', 'are', 'what', 'run', 'processes', 'body.The', 'titular', 'character', 'Osmosis', 'Jones', 'such', 'white', 'blood', 'cell', 'movie', 'Osmosis', 'played', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'police', 'officer', 'are', 'firefighters', 'mayor', 'scientists', 'etc.', 'what', 'referred', 'inside', 'body', 'City', 'Frank', 'Frank', 'live', 'action', 'version', 'played', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'zookeeper', 'Frank', 'widowed', 'ever-disgusting', 'slob', 'father', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'Shane', 'played', 'Elena', 'Franklin', 'exact', 'opposite', 'very', 'health-oriented', 'person', 'who', 'trying', 'get', 'father', 'change', 'lifestyle.In', 'beginning', 'monkey', 'egg', 'Frank', 'Getting', 'back', 'Frank', 'then', 'germed-up', 'egg', 'deadly', 'virus', 'named', 'Thrax', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'get', 'Thrax', 'plan', 'kill', 'Frank', 'three', 'days', 'while', 'making', 'look', 'common', 'cold', 'fool', 'doctors', 'citizens', 'Frank.However', 'Osmosis', 'truth', 'mayor', 'Frank', 'take', 'cold', 'pill', 'introducing', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'duo', 'Drix', 'David', 'Hyde', 'Pierce', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'Osmosis', 'Drix', 'leaving', 'stop', 'Thrax', 'own.Being', 'nearly', '25', 'year', 'old', 'guy', 'could', 'almost', 'say', 'movie', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'mine', 'not', 'Oscar-winning', 'movie', 'always', 'found', 'be', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'simply', 'fun', 'kind', 'movie.Another', 'thing', 'pretty', 'nice', 'generally', 'movie', 'kids', 'have', 'humor', 'would', 'fly', 'right', 'heads', 'most', 'children', 'one', 'scene', 'statue', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'plaque', 'reading', 'Founder', '.The', 'statue', 'sperm', 'cell.So', 'humor', 'everyone.Is', 'movie', 'checking', 'out', 'would', 'say', 'yes', 'love', 'light-hearted', 'simple', 'fun', 'movies', 'great', 'thing', 'was', 'even', 'follow-up', 'animated', 'series', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'Osmosis', 'Drix', 'can', 'always', 'check', 'out']",N/A

I'm glad I watched it first on my own, though, because I'm not sure I'd let any children of my acquaintance watch this. At least not the young ones.I think the movie would have been better without any of the live action characters (Bill Murray, Chris Elliott, etc.) for two reasons. First of all, they're just disgusting. Too disgusting. It got to the point where I'd watch all of Bill Murray's scenes with my hands over my face, peeking between my fingers. Between the running snot, exploding pimples, and ingrown toenails, the ""gross-out factor"" just goes way, way over the top. To me, it stopped being amusing and became just repugnant early on. Like, his first scene.Second, I think the final scenes, when Bill Murray ends up in the emergency room, are far too intense for younger viewers. He basically dies on the table in front of his young daughter (Elena Franklin), who's led away sobbing by nurses. He comes back from the brink of death, of course, and all ends well, but it's still pretty traumatic and graphic.The animation sequences, however, are just wonderful. Bill Murray's character is the ""City of Frank,"" complete with a police force (the white blood cells, featuring Chris Rock), a highway system, airport (Frank's stomach), and even a political campaign (with William Shatner as the incumbent mayor in ""Cerebellum Hall"" and Ron Howard as his challenger). The whole city system inside Frank was a really clever idea and very well executed. David Hyde Pierce is also wonderfully ""uncool"" and fussy as over-the-counter cold pill, Drix (""I was developed at the University of Chicago, where I graduated Phi Beta Capsule""). It's a whole new take on the ""good cop, bad cop"" movies.All this having been said, I'm pretty sure I would watch thie movie again, but I'll be fast forwarding through the live action sequences.

But actually, this movie is a unique comedic gem, and is unexpectedly clever.For example, if you were to watch one of the trailers, you might see the part where a little green germ says &quot;Oh, no, not again!&quot; in an amazingly unfunny voice. From that clip, anybody older than 12 would probably groan. When viewed in the context of the movie, though, the line is actually funny.As everybody else who's written a review will tell you, the animated scenes are far better than the live action sequences. I'm hoping that if we all say it a lot, then you'll remember. The animation is absolutely wonderful, while the live-action scenes are merely average. The Farelly brothers, evidently, have a special talent to be heavy-handed and immature. However, these scenes are not so bad that they ruin the movie. They are somewhat enjoyable and not entirely bad. But when placed next to the adventures of Osmosis Jones, you might be inclined to hate them.If you aren't interested in buying the DVD (Though now I want to, since I've seen the movie) then you should definitely rent it.

His aide (and Ozzy's love interest), Leah, is voiced by Brandy Norwood.This movie is very amusing in some places, but I had to deduct one star because it is, on occasion, REALLY DARN GROSS.  I had to turn my head away from the screen in some places.  However, this is by no means a bad movie.  I personally consider David Hyde Pierce's portrayal of Drix to be one of the best things in the film (if not the very best), especially when Drix busts a secret mob meeting at a disco and utters the following line, doing some dance steps as he speaks:""Attention, germs, you are surrounded.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, SURROUNDED!"".

Well, forget about it, because this is a very funny and downright entertaining movie with no class whatsoever!The scenes bounce between live acting and full animation, determined by whether we are outside or inside the body of Frank.  The casting for this silly and peculiar movie was expertly chosen for both live and voice roles.Live, we have Bill Murray as Frank, in his most disgusting character since Caddyshack.  Chris Elliot plays his brother Bob, and manages to challenge Murray in the &quot;disgusting slob&quot; category.  Murray eats a hard boiled egg that landed in monkey doodoo, and thus introduces Thrax into his body, a red-death virus determined to take over Frank and kill him. (voiced by Laurence Fishburne)Inside of Frank, we go to the animation where Chris Rock is the voice of our hero, a white blood cell named Osmosis Jones.  Jones is a detective for the City Of Frank, where William Shatner does the voice for Mayor Phlemming.  Jones knows something is wrong, but the Mayor denies any illness could occur in Frank.  But just to be safe, he &quot;manually overrides&quot; Frank and has him take a cold pill.Meet Drix, the huge and snotty cold pill, whose voice is played by David Hyde Pierce (Frazier's brother Niles).  Jones and Drix make an unlikely team as they hunt down Thrax and try to stop him from killing Frank.Nothing is taboo here; they go to the nose and get caught up in the wave of snot when Frank's allergies act up, they travel to The Zit, Frank's hottest new club where Kidney Rock is playing (Kidd Rock), and Jones reminisces about the time he hit the &quot;Panic Button&quot; in Frank's stomach, causing him to vomit all over his daughter Shane's teacher. (played live action by Molly Shannon)Boogers, snot, vomit, farts, and zits; its all here.  Ron Howard even does a guest voice as Tom Colonic, running for Mayor against Phlemming, who broadcasts his campaign commercial from The Bowels.This is visceral entertainment with a squishy feel to it, riotously funny and well endowed with toilet humor; silly campy comedy at its very best.  In David Litton's excellent review below, he mentioned that this was a &quot;Fun Time-waster&quot;.  Indeed it is, David.

Frank is a disgusting human being who eats a hard boiled egg from the floor of a monkey's cage and in the process ingests a nasty virus named Thrax. Jones is the only cop who is on to Thrax's evil plan to kill Frank in record time. Jones gets help from an over the counter cold pill named Drix and together they fight to save Frank's life.My Opinion:  The animated portions of the movie were entertaining and fun. The live action portions of the film were gross and not that funny. If it had been 95% animation, this would have been a lot better film. As it is, its audience would be mostly teen and pre-teen boys who are into the gross out humor. Bill Murray's character is disgusting and very hard to like. He doesn't treat his daughter very well. He comes across as very unsympathetic. In the animated portions, all the characters are well done. Chris Rock does an excellent job as Jones. He's funny and you end up rooting for him. David Hyde Pierce is perfect as Drix the cold pill. They make a surprisingly good team. Laurence Fishburne and William Shatner round out the excellent animated cast. If only they could have toned down the live action parts and made Frank more likable. Then we'd probably have a hit on our hands.DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen anamorphic - 2.35:1 Animation is very crisp and clear. Sound:  DD 5.1 The dialog is quiet and the music is loud.  Extras:  Commentary, Trailers, Behind the Scenes Documentary, Deleted Scenes, Hidden Clip  Menus: Average Animated Menus. This is a decent DVD release with a fair amount of extras.What You Should Do:  Rent it if you've got some teen age boys in the house. The animated portion of the story is great, but the live action scenes can get pretty gross.Related Movies To Check Out:  Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Toy Story, Cool World",3,Use a Klenex Would You?,1006300800,"11 21, 2001",2001,1924,"['Movie', 'Summary', 'Osmosis', 'Jones', 'white', 'blood', 'cell', 'body', 'Frank', 'cop', 'who', 'Frank', 'invading', 'germs', 'Frank', 'disgusting', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'hard', 'boiled', 'egg', 'floor', 'monkey', 'cage', 'process', 'nasty', 'virus', 'named', 'Thrax', 'Jones', 'only', 'cop', 'who', 'Thrax', 'evil', 'plan', 'kill', 'Frank', 'record', 'time', 'Jones', 'help', 'counter', 'cold', 'pill', 'named', 'Drix', 'together', 'fight', 'save', 'Frank', 'life.My', 'Opinion', 'animated', 'portions', 'movie', 'were', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'live', 'action', 'portions', 'film', 'were', 'gross', 'not', 'funny', 'had', 'been', '95', '%', 'animation', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'film', 'audience', 'would', 'be', 'mostly', 'teen', 'pre-teen', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'gross', 'out', 'humor', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'character', 'disgusting', 'very', 'hard', 'like', ""n't"", 'treat', 'daughter', 'very', 'well', 'very', 'unsympathetic', 'animated', 'portions', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'excellent', 'job', 'Jones', 'funny', 'end', 'up', 'rooting', 'David', 'Hyde', 'Pierce', 'perfect', 'Drix', 'cold', 'pill', 'make', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'team', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'William', 'Shatner', 'round', 'out', 'excellent', 'animated', 'cast', 'only', 'could', 'have', 'toned', 'down', 'live', 'action', 'parts', 'made', 'Frank', 'more', 'likable', 'Then', ""'d"", 'probably', 'have', 'hit', 'hands.DVD', 'Quality', 'Video', 'Widescreen', 'anamorphic', '2.35:1', 'Animation', 'very', 'crisp', 'clear', 'Sound', 'DD', '5.1', 'dialog', 'quiet', 'music', 'loud', 'Extras', 'Commentary', 'Trailers', 'Scenes', 'Documentary', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'Hidden', 'Clip', 'Menus', 'Average', 'Animated', 'Menus', 'decent', 'DVD', 'release', 'fair', 'amount', 'extras.What', 'Should', 'Do', 'Rent', ""'ve"", 'got', 'teen', 'age', 'boys', 'house', 'animated', 'portion', 'story', 'great', 'live', 'action', 'scenes', 'can', 'get', 'pretty', 'gross.Related', 'Movies', 'Check', 'Out', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Cool', 'World']",N/A

You've got urine, vomit, saliva, pus, snot, gastric fluid, doody, and a vengeful, house-cleaning culminating flatus, all available in one easy package.ShaftandLethal WeaponmeetCool WorldandFantastic Voyage, animated, and for the kids.  A deadly virus finds its way into Frank (Bill Murray), a lovable slob and relatively recent widower.  The virus, given the unintended yet timely name of Thrax, is very well animated, just bad enough, and very sartorially sophisticated.  Thankfully, he is not the traditional over-the-top cheezy bad guy, and has got some bitchen dreads reminiscent of the alien hunter inPredator.  Thrax's is voiced by Laurence Fishburne, sounding an awful lot like an Ivy League Ice-T.  Jones, our hero and cell on the job, voiced by Chris Rock, is the white blood cell-cop who's on the case.  William Shatner is the voice of the self-involved and corrupt mayor of the body politic (ha).  I liked Shatner's voice in this film, but for some reason I kept seeing Rip Torn-go figure.TV's Niles Crane, that is, Frasier's brother, David Hyde Pierce voices the role of the Mr. Spock/Data character, a nerdy, by-the-book, robotic cold pill sent in to partner with Jones.  So you've got the animated cop buddy pic angle goin' on.  At first encounter, Pierce as the cold pill doesn't work, but the character does improve as the film goes on.The film is more or less harmless, although a great deal of its best humor is lost on kids younger than ten, as they have no knowledge of the anatomy which forms the basis of the jokes.  There are some funny gags for grownups down inside Frank, but they are too fleeting, too quick, almost designed for DVD playback.The live action sequences bring us back to the corporeal reality, but aren't that great.  Molly Shannon does the same schtick she did onSaturday Night Live, and it was somehow rewarding to see her vomited upon and have a truly grody zit explode into her face.  Chris Elliott was great albeit thoroughly unoriginal as Frank's co-slob worker.In the end it all works out, everyone does okay, justice is done, and everyone learns a very important lesson, of course.",3,"Suitable Diversion, but Not For the Little Ones",1011484800,"01 20, 2002",2002,2192,"[""'re"", 'bodily', 'fluids', 'be', 'one', ""'ve"", 'got', 'urine', 'vomit', 'saliva', 'pus', 'snot', 'gastric', 'fluid', 'doody', 'vengeful', 'house-cleaning', 'culminating', 'flatus', 'available', 'one', 'easy', 'package.ShaftandLethal', 'WeaponmeetCool', 'WorldandFantastic', 'Voyage', 'animated', 'kids', 'deadly', 'virus', 'way', 'Frank', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'lovable', 'slob', 'relatively', 'recent', 'widower', 'virus', 'given', 'unintended', 'yet', 'timely', 'name', 'Thrax', 'very', 'well', 'animated', 'just', 'bad', 'enough', 'very', 'sartorially', 'sophisticated', 'Thankfully', 'not', 'traditional', 'over-the-top', 'cheezy', 'bad', 'guy', 'got', 'bitchen', 'reminiscent', 'alien', 'hunter', 'inPredator', 'Thrax', 'voiced', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'sounding', 'awful', 'lot', 'Ivy', 'League', 'Ice-T.', 'Jones', 'hero', 'cell', 'job', 'voiced', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'white', 'blood', 'cell-cop', 'who', 'case', 'William', 'Shatner', 'voice', 'self-involved', 'corrupt', 'mayor', 'body', 'politic', 'ha', 'liked', 'Shatner', 'voice', 'film', 'reason', 'kept', 'seeing', 'Rip', 'Torn-go', 'figure.TV', 'Niles', 'Crane', 'Frasier', 'brother', 'David', 'Hyde', 'Pierce', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Spock/Data', 'character', 'nerdy', 'by-the-book', 'robotic', 'cold', 'pill', 'sent', 'partner', 'Jones', 'So', ""'ve"", 'got', 'animated', 'cop', 'buddy', 'pic', 'angle', 'goin', 'first', 'encounter', 'Pierce', 'cold', 'pill', ""n't"", 'work', 'character', 'improve', 'film', 'on.The', 'film', 'more', 'less', 'harmless', 'great', 'deal', 'best', 'humor', 'lost', 'kids', 'younger', 'ten', 'have', 'knowledge', 'anatomy', 'basis', 'jokes', 'are', 'funny', 'gags', 'grownups', 'down', 'inside', 'Frank', 'are', 'too', 'fleeting', 'too', 'quick', 'almost', 'designed', 'DVD', 'playback.The', 'live', 'action', 'sequences', 'bring', 'back', 'corporeal', 'reality', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'same', 'schtick', 'did', 'onSaturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'was', 'somehow', 'rewarding', 'see', 'vomited', 'upon', 'have', 'truly', 'grody', 'zit', 'explode', 'face', 'Chris', 'Elliott', 'was', 'great', 'albeit', 'thoroughly', 'unoriginal', 'Frank', 'co-slob', 'worker.In', 'end', 'out', 'everyone', 'okay', 'justice', 'done', 'everyone', 'very', 'important', 'lesson', 'course']",N/A

I read all the one and two-star reviews and I think their outlook on this movie is too immature. After all, it is a big comedy, and it ALSO gives a great insight on the works of the average inner body, which gives you something to think about what might be happening in your own body if you choose to exercise less. It couldn't have been better made, and if I had kids, this movie would be the best way to explain to them the way your body works.

It is a about a man named Frank (Bill Murray) who gets an infected toe and a deadly virus (Lawrence Fishburn) tries to kill Frank.  His body is Frank City.
