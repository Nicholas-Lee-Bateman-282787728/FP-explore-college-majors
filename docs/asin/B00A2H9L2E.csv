First off is the image of the movie.  I think the director and photographers and all did a wonderful job giving us the Silent Hill dreamy to nightmare quality.  I think that the image of Silent Hill in all its ways comes clear in the visuals.  As for the demons, the creatures weren't your usual monsters as in most films, these are beasts that (as any Silent Hill fan knows) comes out of the deepest recesses of the mind and soul.  If you are a Clive Barker fan, then some of the horrors will remind you of some of his best works.  The story line is something familiar to us as we've seen the first film and played the first and the third video game.  You know these characters and I think the actors and writers do a good job presenting these main characters.

As a result, the story is a little bit foggy (pun intended) but it's a very fun watch.  The only part I didn't really like was the fact that almost everyone's natural accents broke through a bit too much and took me out of the film a bit.  I liked some of the original takes on creatures and the use of minor shocks to create a creepy atmosphere.  The CGI is not the best, but the practical effects are very well-done.All in all?

1604219,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00A2H9L2E,Chris Kennison,"[11, 20]","In 2006, the original ""Silent Hill"" was released and had a unique and well constructed story with a twist and a slow boiling tension throughout the film. ""Silent Hill"" is based on a highly successful video game series and the movie release, in my opinion, was one of the better adaptions and is still a very good movie to check out if you ever get the chance.""Silent Hill 2: Revelation"" follows up on the story from the original. A premise that leaves mother and daughter, Rose (Radha Mitchell) and Sharon (Jodelle Ferland), trapped in the mysterious town of Silent Hill. Meanwhile, father and daughter, Christopher (Sean Bean) and Sharon (Adelaide Clemens), now named Heather, are in the real world and on the run from a strange cult who wants Sharon/Heather. Yes, Sharon is in both worlds, her soul and body split into two and that is why the cult wants her back.You may gather that the movie's storyline is confusing and convoluted. Well, it is. It will help to watch the original movie from 2006 to understand most of it. Walking into ""Silent Hill 2"" without having some understanding of the game series and/or the original movie, would be a large mistake. Even if you have seen or played the things related to this movie, you will find the storyline completely scattered and even at times nonsensical. I have seen and played some of these and even I found the movie confusing and scatterbrained.""Silent Hill 2"" does some things right. The monster effects are tremendous. The deadly homicidal nurses who move and freeze based on sounds were well done and the spider monster was incredibly cool, especially in 3D. The 3D effects in general were some of the best I've seen. When the ash from the burning town falls across Silent Hill, it feels as though the ash is falling right in your lap. The actress Adelaide Clemens did a great job, even if she does look frighteningly like Michelle Williams.On the bad side, the game series of ""Silent Hill"" is about puzzle solving and mystery. The movie tried to have puzzles and mystery, but nearly all of these were poorly handled and didn't give the audience a chance to play along. Most of the movies plot movements were illogical. One moment, Heather states that she doesn't know where the town Silent Hill is, but 2 scenes later they are there. She doesn't know anything about Silent Hill as well, yet the first person she sees there, she instantly states that she knows who she is.Ultimately, ""Silent Hill 2"" is a trip through a haunted house and it has the same effect as well. Some of the jump outs scare you, but for the most part, it is a not-very smart follow up to a very smart original. Not to mention, the ending was anti-climatic and illogical. A very disappointing Halloween movie.",1,Cool effects and Cool 3D... terrible and weak plot and story,1352246400,"11 7, 2012",2012,2740,"['2006', 'original', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'was', 'released', 'had', 'unique', 'well', 'constructed', 'story', 'twist', 'slow', 'boiling', 'tension', 'film', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'based', 'highly', 'successful', 'video', 'game', 'series', 'movie', 'release', 'opinion', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'adaptions', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'check', 'out', 'ever', 'get', 'chance', 'Silent', 'Hill', '2', 'Revelation', 'up', 'story', 'original', 'premise', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Rose', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Sharon', 'Jodelle', 'Ferland', 'trapped', 'mysterious', 'town', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Meanwhile', 'father', 'daughter', 'Christopher', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Sharon', 'Adelaide', 'Clemens', 'now', 'named', 'Heather', 'are', 'real', 'world', 'run', 'strange', 'cult', 'who', 'Sharon/Heather', 'Yes', 'Sharon', 'worlds', 'soul', 'body', 'split', 'two', 'why', 'cult', 'back.You', 'may', 'gather', 'movie', 'storyline', 'confusing', 'convoluted', 'Well', 'will', 'help', 'watch', 'original', 'movie', '2006', 'understand', 'most', 'Walking', 'Silent', 'Hill', '2', 'having', 'understanding', 'game', 'series', 'and/or', 'original', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'large', 'mistake', 'Even', 'have', 'seen', 'played', 'things', 'related', 'movie', 'will', 'find', 'storyline', 'completely', 'scattered', 'even', 'times', 'nonsensical', 'have', 'seen', 'played', 'even', 'found', 'movie', 'confusing', 'scatterbrained', 'Silent', 'Hill', '2', 'things', 'right', 'monster', 'effects', 'are', 'tremendous', 'deadly', 'homicidal', 'nurses', 'who', 'move', 'freeze', 'based', 'sounds', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'spider', 'monster', 'was', 'incredibly', 'cool', 'especially', '3D', '3D', 'effects', 'general', 'were', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'When', 'ash', 'burning', 'town', 'falls', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'ash', 'falling', 'right', 'lap', 'actress', 'Adelaide', 'Clemens', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'even', 'look', 'frighteningly', 'Michelle', 'Williams.On', 'bad', 'side', 'game', 'series', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'puzzle', 'solving', 'mystery', 'movie', 'tried', 'have', 'puzzles', 'mystery', 'nearly', 'were', 'poorly', 'handled', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'audience', 'chance', 'play', 'along', 'Most', 'movies', 'plot', 'movements', 'were', 'illogical', 'One', 'moment', 'Heather', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'town', 'Silent', 'Hill', '2', 'scenes', 'later', 'are', 'there', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'as', 'well', 'yet', 'first', 'person', 'there', 'instantly', 'who', 'is.Ultimately', 'Silent', 'Hill', '2', 'trip', 'haunted', 'house', 'same', 'effect', 'well', 'jump', 'scare', 'most', 'part', 'not-very', 'smart', 'follow', 'up', 'very', 'smart', 'original', 'Not', 'mention', 'ending', 'was', 'anti-climatic', 'illogical', 'very', 'disappointing', 'Halloween', 'movie']",N/A
1604220,A304GUEPCPYM3Z,B00A2H9L2E,"citan-uzuki ""citan-uzuki""","[0, 1]","This story concludes the one began with the first Silent Hill movie of 2006.  Chris and Sharon DaSilva are on the run from members of the Order.  The Order knows that Sharon is carrying a part of Alessa's soul in her.  She is also in possession of a mysterious round amulet that the cult wants.  Using the names Harry and Heather Mason, the two have been moving constantly from town to town.The story begins with Heather's first day at her new school.  While there, she meets another new student named Vincent Cooper.  Later that day, she learns from a private investigator that the cult has located them.  When Harry fails to show up at their designated meeting place, Heather hurries home to find a message written in blood.  The message instructs her to go to Silent Hill to save her father.  Heather takes the amulet, and with Vincent for company, make their way to Silent Hill, in West Virginia.While resting at a motel, Vincent admits that he is a member of the cult.  He was sent to bring Heather back to Silent Hill.  But he sees that Heather is good, and not evil like Alessa.  He warns her to stay away from Silent Hill.  Undeterred, Heather decides to proceed anyway.  At the hospital, Vincent is attacked by a monster.  The two get separated.  Heather finds Leonard, the former leader of the cult.  Heather mistakenly gives Leonard her half of the medallion/amulet, turning Leonard into a monster.  Meanwhile, the cult wants to punish Vincent for betraying them.  They decide to send him to the asylum for ""treatment"".After she manages to get away from Leonard, Heather meets Dahlia outside.  Dahlia tells her that Alessa has given part of her soul, the part that can still feel love, to Heather.  The cult wants to sacrifice her, believing that doing so will bring an end to the nightmare world that Alessa has trapped them in.  That is the reason why the cult has been pursuing Harry and Heather for many years.  They also wanted the amulet that Harry had been hiding.She finds Vincent strapped to a gurney, surrounded by knife-wielding nurses in short, sexy dresses.  Yes, the same ones that Rose had to deal with in the first movie.  Trying her best to keep quiet, she helps Vincent out of his restraints.  But the nurses reacts to the sound and starts slashing at them.  They barely make it out of the hospital.Alessa confronts Heather at the amusement park.  Heather and Alessa fight for dominance, with the former coming out on top.  Now in control, Heather finally confronts the current cult leader, Claudia.  During their exchange, Claudia finally reveals that Heather will be sacrificed in order to birth their God.  As Claudia touches the amulet, she transforms into a beast.  And right at that moment, Pyramid Head shows up.  Claudia and Pyramid Head battle it out.Sean Bean, Carrie-Ann Moss, Malcolm McDowell, and Deborah Kara Unger make up the veteran all-star cast.  Newcomers Adelaide Clemens and Kit Harrington play the roles of Heather and Vincent, respectively.  Needless to say, the acting performances are beyond reproach.  I do not think Sean Bean can be bad at any acting role.  The man is always great at every role he has been in.  The same can be said for Malcolm McDowell and Carrie-Ann Moss.  Adelaide Clemens is a future star.  She has good acting skills and terrific looks to go along with it.  Kit Harrington is reunited with his fellow ""A Game of Thrones"" cast member, Sean Bean.  He does a pretty good job here as Vincent, playing an American teenager.Silent Hill and Resident Evil are two of the most successful movie franchises to have been inspired by video games.  Both games came out on the original Sony Playstation.  They were some of the best examples of the Survival-Horror genre.  The popularity of the genre and the dominance of the Sony Playstation console, helped ensure that there would be a large fan base for these games.  And that fandom transferred over to the movie franchises themselves.  Resident Evil has now had five movies.  Hopefully there will be many more movies in the Silent Hill franchise.You should first watch ""Silent Hill"" before viewing this one, ""Silent Hill: Revelation"".  I highly recommend this movie.",4,The story continues,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,4184,"['story', 'one', 'began', 'first', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'movie', '2006', 'Chris', 'Sharon', 'DaSilva', 'are', 'run', 'members', 'Order', 'Order', 'Sharon', 'carrying', 'part', 'Alessa', 'soul', 'also', 'possession', 'mysterious', 'round', 'amulet', 'cult', 'Using', 'names', 'Harry', 'Heather', 'Mason', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'moving', 'constantly', 'town', 'town.The', 'story', 'Heather', 'first', 'day', 'new', 'school', 'there', 'new', 'student', 'named', 'Vincent', 'Cooper', 'Later', 'day', 'private', 'investigator', 'cult', 'located', 'When', 'Harry', 'show', 'up', 'designated', 'meeting', 'place', 'Heather', 'home', 'find', 'message', 'written', 'blood', 'message', 'go', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'save', 'father', 'amulet', 'Vincent', 'company', 'make', 'way', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'West', 'Virginia.While', 'resting', 'motel', 'Vincent', 'member', 'cult', 'was', 'sent', 'bring', 'Heather', 'back', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Heather', 'good', 'not', 'evil', 'Alessa', 'stay', 'away', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Undeterred', 'Heather', 'proceed', 'anyway', 'hospital', 'Vincent', 'attacked', 'monster', 'two', 'get', 'separated', 'Heather', 'Leonard', 'former', 'leader', 'cult', 'mistakenly', 'Leonard', 'half', 'medallion/amulet', 'turning', 'Leonard', 'monster', 'Meanwhile', 'cult', 'punish', 'Vincent', 'betraying', 'decide', 'send', 'asylum', 'treatment', '.After', 'get', 'away', 'Leonard', 'Heather', 'Dahlia', 'outside', 'Dahlia', 'Alessa', 'given', 'part', 'soul', 'part', 'can', 'still', 'feel', 'love', 'Heather', 'cult', 'sacrifice', 'believing', 'doing', 'so', 'will', 'bring', 'end', 'nightmare', 'world', 'Alessa', 'trapped', 'reason', 'why', 'cult', 'been', 'pursuing', 'Harry', 'Heather', 'many', 'years', 'also', 'wanted', 'amulet', 'Harry', 'had', 'been', 'hiding.She', 'Vincent', 'strapped', 'gurney', 'surrounded', 'knife-wielding', 'nurses', 'short', 'sexy', 'dresses', 'Yes', 'same', 'ones', 'Rose', 'had', 'deal', 'first', 'movie', 'Trying', 'best', 'keep', 'quiet', 'Vincent', 'restraints', 'nurses', 'sound', 'slashing', 'barely', 'make', 'hospital.Alessa', 'Heather', 'amusement', 'park', 'Heather', 'Alessa', 'fight', 'dominance', 'former', 'coming', 'out', 'top', 'Now', 'control', 'Heather', 'finally', 'current', 'cult', 'leader', 'Claudia', 'exchange', 'Claudia', 'finally', 'Heather', 'will', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'order', 'birth', 'God', 'Claudia', 'amulet', 'beast', 'right', 'moment', 'Pyramid', 'Head', 'up', 'Claudia', 'Pyramid', 'Head', 'battle', 'out.Sean', 'Bean', 'Carrie-Ann', 'Moss', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'make', 'up', 'veteran', 'all-star', 'cast', 'Newcomers', 'Adelaide', 'Clemens', 'Kit', 'Harrington', 'play', 'roles', 'Heather', 'Vincent', 'respectively', 'Needless', 'say', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'reproach', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'can', 'be', 'bad', 'acting', 'role', 'man', 'always', 'great', 'role', 'been', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'Carrie-Ann', 'Moss', 'Adelaide', 'Clemens', 'future', 'star', 'good', 'acting', 'skills', 'terrific', 'looks', 'go', 'along', 'Kit', 'Harrington', 'reunited', 'fellow', 'A', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'cast', 'member', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'Vincent', 'playing', 'American', 'teenager.Silent', 'Hill', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'successful', 'movie', 'franchises', 'have', 'been', 'inspired', 'video', 'games', 'games', 'came', 'out', 'original', 'Sony', 'Playstation', 'were', 'best', 'examples', 'Survival-Horror', 'genre', 'popularity', 'genre', 'dominance', 'Sony', 'Playstation', 'console', 'helped', 'ensure', 'would', 'be', 'large', 'fan', 'base', 'games', 'fandom', 'transferred', 'movie', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'now', 'had', 'five', 'movies', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'many', 'more', 'movies', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'franchise.You', 'should', 'first', 'watch', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'viewing', 'one', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Revelation', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie']",N/A

1604237,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00A2H9L2E,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[3, 4]","&#34;Silent Hill: Revelation&#34; is one of those films that asks way too much from its audience to be successful. The original film came out six years ago. That's a long time for regular moviegoers to remember what the first one was about without doing some sort of research.Basically, it asks all its viewers to invest an extra 90 minutes of their life in seeing the first movie before taking in the new one. That's a lot to expect from people who may not feel like catching up with a film released in 2006 that critics flamed and many audience members were on the fence over. In a nutshell, &#34;Silent Hill: Revelation&#34; takes a whole lot for granted.Another thing filmmakers expect from viewers of &#34;Silent Hill: Revelation&#34; is a knowledge of the video game. If you haven't played it, chances are you're going to be completely lost as far as plot or characters go. The uneducated will likely feel as if they've been thrown to the proverbial wolves.It feels like script and dialogue writers tried to put together a sensible explanation of what's happening in the film, but somehow everything got jumbled up in front of the camera and when actual actors had to recite their lines. The whole movie just feels like someone is telling a joke and everyone around is in on it except you.For a movie that is 90 percent CGI, producers sure didn't feel the need to up the budget enough to keep &#34;Silent Hill: Revelation&#34; from letting everyone in on the very apparent secret that it was entirely shot in front of a piece of green cloth. I can't believe a mining town in the middle of nowhere covered in soot and dust could look so shiny and glistening. I will say that the interior sets were rather impressive and did emanate a sense of grime and claustrophobia.The only extra feature included in the DVD edition of the movie is a &#34;Behind-the-Scenes&#34; featurette entitled &#34;A Look Inside 'Silent Hill: Revelation.'&#34; That's not much for fans of this franchise to get excited about. The Blu-ray version doesn't give consumers any more incentive to spring for it because it basically contains the same bonus material.&#34;Silent Hill: Revelation&#34; might be attractive to gamers who are familiar with its world. However, if you walk into it blindly with no prior knowledge of its characters or the first film, you'll be lost in a sea of confusing dialogue and convoluted storytelling that rests on the laurels of its gore. If you have a limited amount of time to dedicate for movie watching, you might want to take a pass on this one.",2,"DVD Review: ""Silent Hill: Revelation""",1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,2558,"['34', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Revelation', '34', 'one', 'films', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'audience', 'be', 'successful', 'original', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'six', 'years', 'ago', 'long', 'time', 'regular', 'moviegoers', 'remember', 'what', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'doing', 'sort', 'research.Basically', 'viewers', 'invest', 'extra', '90', 'minutes', 'life', 'seeing', 'first', 'movie', 'taking', 'new', 'one', 'lot', 'expect', 'people', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'feel', 'catching', 'up', 'film', 'released', '2006', 'critics', 'flamed', 'many', 'audience', 'members', 'were', 'fence', 'nutshell', '34', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Revelation', '34', 'whole', 'lot', 'granted.Another', 'thing', 'filmmakers', 'expect', 'viewers', '34', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Revelation', '34', 'knowledge', 'video', 'game', 'have', ""n't"", 'played', 'chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'completely', 'lost', 'as', 'far', 'plot', 'characters', 'go', 'uneducated', 'will', 'likely', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'thrown', 'proverbial', 'wolves.It', 'feels', 'script', 'dialogue', 'writers', 'tried', 'put', 'together', 'sensible', 'explanation', 'what', 'happening', 'film', 'somehow', 'everything', 'got', 'jumbled', 'up', 'front', 'camera', 'when', 'actual', 'actors', 'had', 'recite', 'lines', 'whole', 'movie', 'just', 'feels', 'someone', 'telling', 'joke', 'everyone', 'around', 'movie', '90', 'percent', 'CGI', 'producers', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'up', 'budget', 'enough', 'keep', '34', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Revelation', '34', 'letting', 'everyone', 'very', 'apparent', 'secret', 'was', 'entirely', 'shot', 'front', 'piece', 'green', 'cloth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'mining', 'town', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'covered', 'soot', 'dust', 'could', 'look', 'so', 'shiny', 'glistening', 'will', 'say', 'interior', 'sets', 'were', 'rather', 'impressive', 'did', 'emanate', 'sense', 'grime', 'claustrophobia.The', 'only', 'extra', 'feature', 'included', 'DVD', 'edition', 'movie', '34', 'Behind-the-Scenes', '34', 'featurette', 'entitled', '34', 'Look', 'Inside', ""'Silent"", 'Hill', 'Revelation', '34', 'not', 'much', 'fans', 'franchise', 'get', 'excited', 'Blu-ray', 'version', ""n't"", 'give', 'consumers', 'more', 'incentive', 'spring', 'basically', 'same', 'bonus', 'material.', '34', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Revelation', '34', 'might', 'be', 'attractive', 'gamers', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'world', 'However', 'walk', 'blindly', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'characters', 'first', 'film', ""'ll"", 'be', 'lost', 'sea', 'confusing', 'dialogue', 'convoluted', 'storytelling', 'laurels', 'gore', 'have', 'limited', 'amount', 'time', 'dedicate', 'movie', 'watching', 'might', 'want', 'take', 'pass', 'one']",N/A

Sure, it got certain elements of the video game right, but overall, it felt forced in its style to appeal to the non-video game crowd.This one, though, sticks more to the games. Specifically, Silent Hill 3. Hey, even Sharon/Heather looks EXACTLY like Heather from SH3, and that she spends a chunk of time in a mall like you start in the game adds good repute points for me to this movie. And that's not the only thing its gets right. Sure, it's got continuity from the first movie to keep the story straight, but the fact that it can keep continuation from the first movie and stick faithfully close to the third game in more than one breath (let alone for over half the movie) makes it deserving of praise.I was just a touch worried that this movie would be a little cheesy like most sequels to any kind of movie would be, but I was relieved that the filmmakers (in every field with this case) learned from past mistakes and improved on everything and then threw in extra stuff that, surprisingly, did not make it feel bogged down in the slightest. Very good, clipping pace, even the ""normal"" scenes that help bring in characterization to each person, and the little subtleties therein, the extremely disturbing cult (straight from SH3 AND the first movie), even the nurses and Pyramid Head look exceptional. And, not to mention, the added bonuses of a Numb Body cameo (which looked jaw-droppingly excellent and downright chilling) and Malcolm McDowell as Leonard Wolf (and his great acting in quite a short amount of time), it all shwoed how much the filmmakers cared to appeal to anyone who loves not only horror in general, but also Silent Hill overall.

1604255,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B00A2H9L2E,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[0, 0]","Silent Hill: Revelation follows Heather Mason as her father is kidnapped and used as bait to lure her into the nightmarish town of Silent Hill. The story is a bit deeper, but I'll leave it at that for the sake of this review's length. Silent Hill: Revelation is a decent time-killer, but it's riddled with flaws.First, the story in Silent Hill: Revelation is mediocre. It doesn't exactly follow the story in Silent Hill 3, but does use some of its elements and characters. They changed certain parts of the story and they use most of the characters; they really nailed Heather's look, which is a plus. Considering I've played the game and watched the original movie and I still managed to get lost a bit and question my memory, I believe this film might be a little confusing for those with little to no experience with the franchise. Also, the film has poor screen direction, which negatively affects the story. One moment they'll be here, the next moment they'll be in an entirely different location, with little to no explanation; one thing that made the Silent Hill games great is the dreadful atmosphere and tension while exploring the creepy locations, unfortunately, this is absent in this film. It really skips most exploration, which leaves every scene feel like they're not connected. Also, when things look like they'll get heated and intense, like it would in a boss fight, the fights/chases end quickly and usually cheaply. And, finally, the ending leaves you with a big ""WHAT?"", whether you're a fan or not; (SPOILER: skip to the next paragraph if you're avoiding spoilers.) The finale is a battle between Pyramid Head and Claudia, something you'd expect in a movie like Star Wars or anything with sword fights, with blades clashing; and, this also has little explanation. (Pyramid Head's appearance in this film is questionable itself)However, the film's creepy monster design is great and I've always loved the transition from regular reality to the hellish Otherworld. The cinematography and most of the special effects were also great, although there were some special effects I disliked. For example, this film uses computer-generated blood, likely for the 3D effect, which looks very unnatural and hurts the immersion in the film, in my opinion; this problem isn't consistent, though, as I only noticed it occasionally. Fans of violent horror films might enjoy this gorefest; fans of jump-scares will also find a few effective scares here. The acting was good most of the time, although there are a couple of lines of dialogue that felt forced and a few that were just cheesy. Finally, I really enjoyed the several references to the series, including the guest appearances at the end, and I enjoyed the music.Overall, Silent Hill: Revelation has a few redeeming qualities including the haunting setting, mostly great special effects, and the video game references but the poor story, and terrible storytelling hurt the film significantly. On top of that, the film just doesn't feel like Silent Hill without the psychological approach and the haunting symbolism of the game; don't get me wrong, though, I didn't let the film's relation to this series affect my score, it's simply a mediocre movie overall. This is definitely a missed opportunity after the first film, which I really liked. If you're interested in watching this film, I suggest a rental after watching the original.Silent Hill: Revelation has strong violence and gore, some brief nudity.",2,"A Decent Time-Killer...

Its so good that its worth it to purchase this just for the 3D alone. There is constant depth throughout the entire film (3D on par with Avatar and Hugo) and more than half a dozen pop-outs, some that come a couple feet out of the screen. When you combine the amazing 3D with this type of movie, it makes it a very enjoyable popcorn flick.I was really contemplating on how many stars I should give the movie. If I was going by the movie itself I would have probably only given it 2 or 2 1/2 stars. Its has a pretty good story, its acting is mediocre at best, and it does a good job at being pretty scary, but its very gory and quite disturbing. I'd put it exactly on par with the first film. But when you take the average horror movie that this is and combine it with some of the best 3D I've ever seen, it turns it into a very exciting horror film experience.

Some people are upset that it follows the plot of the game (#3) loosely, and if you are expecting an original horror story, you'd better go elsewhere.

I was a bit disappointed that it is only 95 minutes long, they could have easily added another 30 minutes of plot from the game.**************SPOILERS*************Did anyone else find it weird that she was sitting on her dad's lap? Maybe it's just me, but I outgrew that when I was about 9. In the movie she is supposed to be about 16/17 I think, it really creeped me out. (in the game she is in her 20's?)I loved how she put that bully in her place at school. lolzThey could have done away with her ""defeating"" Alessa at the carousel, and just had her merge back with herself. Would have made more sense that having a metaphysical showdown with herself. Especially since there is no info conveyed besides a couple of lines and facial expressions. These kinds of scenes work in books, not so much in movies.I'm guessing from the ending there will be another Silent Hill sometime, but I don't know if they plan on using the plot from the second game (which wouldn't make any sense at all) or if they are going to write an original third film.

I had no idea this movie was going to be about Heather untill I saw her white vest and hoodie sweater. In the opening scene. It hard to say if this one was bad or good. Really I just think it was too short. The plot stuck to the game a lot more than the first movie did and I like that even though some things changed she went to all the correct locations AND IN ORDER!!!. I disliked SH1 the movie so much because it was barely anything like the game. With Silent Hill Revelation's what's changed so much is that the movie has a lot more akward gore scenes than suspense. Silent Hill isn't really a ""gory"" type of game it's more of a ""suspense"" type of story. So that was a bit wierd to see as it didn't exactly fit with the theme of the game. There's no people getting chopped up or having thier skin sawed off in the game so why is it in the movie I don't know, also theres these random soldier guys thrown in and the town seems to be full of people which is also strange. In the game the town is empty and only monsters run about. That's what makes it strange when you find a real live humanbeing but in the movie that seems to be forgotten. They did the ""Nurse"" scene again in this movie I liked that part they're iconic to the game. What is thrown off that puts me halfway between this being good or bad is the storyline. Some stuff is true to the game but the some of it isn't. SH3 explains a lot about why silent hill is the way it is and the forces behind it. You see Pyramid Head doing his job as Alessa's protector but you don't see the other one that's responsible for turning the normal world into the nightmare world by turning the valves. Not that it's a big deal but it's a major part of the story line to explain the two guardians. Also there's Alessa and the order and their mission isn't explained well about them wanting to create a new God and Heather being the key to giving birth to that God. The ending feels very rushed like the movie is missing about another 45minutes. Considering how much I disliked the first one but how I wanted to see more of this one I say it's a decent movie but it could have ended better. If they do make another movie I atleast hope they adopt thier own story and pick it up where they left off with Heather. I don't mind seeing her since she is one of my favorite SH characters.",3,I didn't know this was about Silent Hill 3,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,2448,"['Silent', 'Hill', '3', 'favorite', 'series', '1', 'course', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'first', 'time', 'played', 'had', 'idea', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Heather', 'untill', 'saw', 'white', 'vest', 'hoodie', 'sweater', 'opening', 'scene', 'hard', 'say', 'one', 'was', 'bad', 'good', 'Really', 'just', 'think', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'plot', 'stuck', 'game', 'lot', 'more', 'first', 'movie', 'did', 'like', 'even', 'things', 'changed', 'went', 'correct', 'locations', 'AND', 'IN', 'ORDER', 'disliked', 'SH1', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'barely', 'anything', 'game', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Revelation', 'what', 'changed', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'akward', 'gore', 'scenes', 'suspense', 'Silent', 'Hill', ""n't"", 'really', 'gory', 'type', 'game', 'more', 'suspense', 'type', 'story', 'was', 'bit', 'wierd', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'fit', 'theme', 'game', 'people', 'getting', 'chopped', 'up', 'having', 'thier', 'skin', 'sawed', 'off', 'game', 'so', 'why', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'also', 'random', 'soldier', 'guys', 'thrown', 'town', 'be', 'full', 'people', 'also', 'strange', 'game', 'town', 'empty', 'only', 'monsters', 'run', 'about', 'what', 'strange', 'when', 'find', 'real', 'live', 'humanbeing', 'movie', 'be', 'forgotten', 'did', 'Nurse', 'scene', 'again', 'movie', 'liked', 'part', ""'re"", 'iconic', 'game', 'What', 'thrown', 'off', 'halfway', 'being', 'good', 'bad', 'storyline', 'stuff', 'true', 'game', ""n't"", 'SH3', 'lot', 'why', 'silent', 'hill', 'way', 'forces', 'see', 'Pyramid', 'Head', 'doing', 'job', 'Alessa', 'protector', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'one', 'responsible', 'turning', 'normal', 'world', 'nightmare', 'world', 'turning', 'valves', 'Not', 'big', 'deal', 'major', 'part', 'story', 'line', 'explain', 'two', 'guardians', 'Also', 'Alessa', 'order', 'mission', ""n't"", 'explained', 'well', 'wanting', 'create', 'new', 'God', 'Heather', 'being', 'key', 'giving', 'birth', 'God', 'ending', 'feels', 'very', 'rushed', 'movie', 'missing', '45minutes', 'Considering', 'how', 'much', 'disliked', 'first', 'one', 'how', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'one', 'say', 'decent', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'better', 'do', 'make', 'movie', 'atleast', 'hope', 'adopt', 'thier', 'own', 'story', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'Heather', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'one', 'favorite', 'SH', 'characters']",N/A

Unfortunately it falls so short, that its actually easy to fall asleep while watching it.Gone are the all creatively made demons and fractured humans skulking about, unless of course you count the old costumes from the original they reused in some scenes, like the Nurses, and just reshot them all over again, or incorporated CGI which was not used in the original.  In fact, many scenes are just flashbacks to the original.  I can only think of how cheap it must have been to make this movie.

There is a plot though , a young girl returns to silent hill , a place cursed by a order. of evil. Well that's the plot mainly. Ok, it's not got a huge plot here! but what it DOES have is a great use of 3d for effect. This is all about the 3d money shots. Personally I really enjoy those type of in your face 3d films. I enjoy regular movies though which just use 3d for effect too.  Both 3d types are valid and I like 3d enough to wish that every film was shot in 3d. This was shot in 3d, and it really benefits on that level. It goes for many shots of things flying at  you in 3d. It is not about plot as much as effect. Which is fine here , I have 'man in the dark 3d'  from 1953 and it also uses 3d for this type of effect and it does have  a great plot. You can get that at screen archives.com,  anyways get this one for it's great native 3d and many money shots!  This isn't a great movie and if I saw this in 2d it would be a very much lower rated film by me. But for a 3d flick about wild scenes and money shots this delivers.  The plot is there though. Will the young girl get out of silent hill with her dad?  will she stop the evil half of herself.  ok, it's a very loose plot but it's a Great 3d effect flick.  You can have both too though!  ON blu ray I had only one scene of ghosting. That's quite impressive too with a active 3d player.

I did not watch this in 3D and unfortunately there were a few awkward scenes that were meant solely for 3D and when viewed in regular they seemed overly cheesy and weird.This one isn't that scary but it does have a lot of creepy parts. Several scenes felt very rushed and several of the monsters barely had a justifiable amount of screen time because of it. This movie should and could have easily been longer and I feel it would have been twice as great if the scenes had deeper development.All in all I really enjoyed this movie, it did the best it could in transferring a terrifying video game to a 90 minute film. The acting was great, the soundtrack was of course awesome and the special effects were the best they could be. A few scenes will defiantly stick around in my head as being not only creepy but refreshingly original.I won't say if it was better than the first or not because they are almost two completely separate things. Even though this is a direct sequel it has a totally different feel to it and it works.

With its stunning, powerful 3D, the characters, demons and monsters are presented with incredible dimension comparable to Avatar 3D and even surpasses the 3D efforts of Resident Evil Afterlife 3D. Not only does it deliver powerful 3D among the best movies 3D has to offer, but also sustains this 3D from start to finish.The pop outs are second to none, reaching way past the barrier of the screen as monsters strike out at the viewer. Particles like falling ash/snow and a nice variety of scenery, in the city, school, amusement park, etc. I cannot say enough good things about the 3D dimension, depth, pop outs and volume in Silent Hill Revelation. Spectacular 3D.The film itself follows up the story of Mason (Sean Bean), and his now older adopted Daughter Heather, who is being sought by the evil order of Silent Hill's underworld, to free them from their hell bound prison  by using her as a vessel for their deity. Discovering more as she proceeds, she abandons her hope for a normal life, and re-enters Silent Hill in search of her father and experiences the relentless monsters inhabiting the realm. The story focuses heavily on detailing (back story) as much as possible, why she is there, and how she can resolve her horrifying situation. The sirens return along with the fog, the town with empty buildings, familiar and new monsters and the metal and twisted creatures of the dark realm.3D Dimension: 10/103D Depth: 10/103D Volume: 10/103D Pop Out: 10/103D Overall: 10/10Story; 7/10 Interesting, but with loose ends and much back story.Acting: 7/10.

I've seen the first Silent Hill, but maybe if I played the video game I'd have a little bit more to work with.  As it stands, this movie was horrible.  The movie was a montage of creatures, spontaneous darkness and cult members.

Personally I think the movies in general have been about 50% cool and 50% fail.  I love to see the creatures come to life and the attempts at creating SH atmosphere, but the spirit of what makes the games scary is just not there.  Additionally, the movies focus so much on the cult that it ruins the mystery of what SH is all about.  I feel like they won&#8217;t make a good sh movie until clive barker and david lynch strike a deal to co-direct.I totally respect that some people hate this movie.  I suppose technically it is not even close to the original which was only ok anyway.That being said, I had a lot of fun watching it.  I left the theater feeling that I wished the movie makers had the budget of the first one. You could tell that they did try very hard to make the movie as genuine as possible while being held back by budget and plot lines of the first movie.Pros,Creatures &#8211; still cool.  Mostly practical effects & costumes except for one I can think of.A fun ride through SH3 with some story changes.Decent number of homages to other SH gamesConsBased on one of the lamest game stories in cannon Silent Hill. &#8211; There really isn&#8217;t much to the story of the 3rd game despite having some of the best in game scares.They took the best scene of SH3 out (probably due to budget)They were forced to try to tie it to the first silent hill movie.Not scary&#8211; more special effects heavy and not really scary.  The first one was not scary either.  neither could recapture the interactive psychological fear of the games.If you go in with an open mind and just want to see some cool stuff that is SH related, the movie is just fine.  If you want it to be an authentic recreation of the game you will hate it and lose your mind.  When you wake up you will be in a foggy town.

1604306,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00A2H9L2E,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Silent Hill: Revelation (Michael J. Bassett, 2012)[censored for Amazon consumption]. I hate that this movie even exists. The original Silent Hill may not be the best videogame adaptation in all of film, but if it isn't, it's in the top two. Despite it being pretty much impossible for a sequel to have continued on down that same road--there wasn't terribly much left at the end of the first movie to work with--I was still cautiously optimistic when I heard this second one was coming out; I figured they would keep the actual town of Silent Hill intact (and indeed, Deborah Kara Unger returns) and come up with a completely unrelated story. And they kinda-sorta did, but here's the movie's first problem: Laurent Hadida, turning in his first adaptation, decided to try and tie the story in using a series of ridiculous coincidences and stretches.Plot: Heather (The Great Gatsby's Adelaide Clemens) and her father have spent the entirety of Heather's young life moving from town to town; as we open, they've found themselves in another generic suburb, and Heather is starting at another new school. This time, however, there's another new kid: Vincent (Games of Thrones' Kit Harrington). The two of them, against Heather's better judgment, bond, and when Heather's father goes missing, and she finds a message scrawled on the wall of their apartment telling her to come to Silent Hill if she wants to save him, Vincent tags along--but it turns out that none of the players have the full story......and I'm not entirely sure the screenwriters did, either. Once Heather and Vincent get to Silent Hill, the actual storyline takes a back seat to the crew's desire to shove as many special effects into this movie as possible. And it's not the back seat of a sedan, either, it's the back seat of a very long bus. There are some times when this is not necessarily a bad thing. We all knew going in that Alien vs. Predator was going to be a stupid movie where a lot of stuff blows up, and we went to the theater and sat down, and it was a stupid movie where a lot of stuff blows up, and I had a whale of a time. But Silent Hill, that was something entirely different, creepy and atmospheric and effective, and most importantly for the sake of this discussion a movie that set a bar that its sequel was going to have to live up to--never mind that the chances that it could were vanishingly small. And we went to the theater, we sat down (okay, I dialed it up on Netflix Instant, but still), and we got a stupid movie where a lot of stuff blows up, but one that didn't even have the breakneck pace of AvP; there was a stage in this film's development where Bassett and Co. really were trying to make a movie that would have stood up to the first one. Somewhere along the way, I suspect, that idea got dropped, but not enough of it got removed during the rewrite to even make this a guilty pleasure; instead, the first half of the movie, as inept as it is, serves to highlight what could have been had a little more thought been put into this. * ",2,Sophomore Slump.,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,3038,"['Silent', 'Hill', 'Revelation', 'Michael', 'J.', 'Bassett', '2012', '[', 'censored', 'Amazon', 'consumption', ']', 'hate', 'movie', 'even', 'original', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'videogame', 'adaptation', 'film', ""n't"", 'top', 'two', 'being', 'pretty', 'much', 'impossible', 'sequel', 'have', 'continued', 'down', 'same', 'road', 'was', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'much', 'left', 'end', 'first', 'movie', 'work', 'was', 'still', 'cautiously', 'optimistic', 'when', 'heard', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'figured', 'would', 'keep', 'actual', 'town', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'intact', 'indeed', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'returns', 'come', 'up', 'completely', 'unrelated', 'story', 'kinda-sorta', 'did', 'here', 'movie', 'first', 'problem', 'Laurent', 'Hadida', 'turning', 'first', 'adaptation', 'decided', 'try', 'tie', 'story', 'using', 'series', 'ridiculous', 'coincidences', 'stretches.Plot', 'Heather', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'Adelaide', 'Clemens', 'father', 'have', 'spent', 'entirety', 'Heather', 'young', 'life', 'moving', 'town', 'town', 'open', ""'ve"", 'found', 'generic', 'suburb', 'Heather', 'starting', 'new', 'school', 'time', 'however', 'new', 'kid', 'Vincent', 'Games', 'Thrones', 'Kit', 'Harrington', 'two', 'Heather', 'better', 'judgment', 'bond', 'when', 'Heather', 'father', 'missing', 'message', 'scrawled', 'wall', 'apartment', 'telling', 'come', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'save', 'Vincent', 'along', 'out', 'none', 'players', 'have', 'full', 'story', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'screenwriters', 'did', 'Once', 'Heather', 'Vincent', 'get', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'actual', 'storyline', 'back', 'seat', 'crew', 'desire', 'shove', 'many', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'possible', 'not', 'back', 'seat', 'sedan', 'either', 'back', 'seat', 'very', 'long', 'bus', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'knew', 'going', 'Alien', 'vs', 'Predator', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'stupid', 'movie', 'where', 'lot', 'stuff', 'up', 'went', 'theater', 'sat', 'down', 'was', 'stupid', 'movie', 'where', 'lot', 'stuff', 'up', 'had', 'whale', 'time', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'was', 'something', 'entirely', 'different', 'creepy', 'atmospheric', 'effective', 'most', 'importantly', 'sake', 'discussion', 'movie', 'set', 'bar', 'sequel', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'live', 'up', 'never', 'mind', 'chances', 'could', 'were', 'vanishingly', 'small', 'went', 'theater', 'sat', 'down', 'okay', 'dialed', 'up', 'Netflix', 'Instant', 'still', 'got', 'stupid', 'movie', 'where', 'lot', 'stuff', 'up', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'AvP', 'was', 'stage', 'film', 'development', 'where', 'Bassett', 'Co.', 'really', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'stood', 'up', 'first', 'one', 'Somewhere', 'way', 'suspect', 'idea', 'got', 'dropped', 'not', 'enough', 'got', 'removed', 'rewrite', 'even', 'make', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'instead', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'as', 'inept', 'serves', 'highlight', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'thought', 'been', 'put', '*']",N/A

The sets and props are all very good. The effects and CGI effects are top notch A-list level quality. Overall, this movie is impressive. There are no dry or dull areas in this movie its 0-60 from the start. The Silent Hill franchise is very impressive; the producers need to focus on quality script, and character development to industry A-list level. This franchise has a niche of its own similar to Resident evil, and they can probably produce another (3) sequels. These types of movies are special and rare, so I recommend you buy it on Blue Ray.

Not only will this film make better sense, but I consider ""Silent Hill"" to one of the top 100 horror films of all time. Clearly this film was not as good as the first. For me, the element of surprise was gone. This production also suffered from plot weakness, trite dialouge, and an unconvincing role by Adelaide Clemens as the lead character. I kept thinking how much better this film could have been if Ms. Clemens had swapped roles with Jennifer Lawrence in ""House at the End of the Street.""This film picks up years later as Sharon has grown to 18 years of age and has changed her name to Heather...named after Harry's (Sean Bean) grandmother, the first thing I couldn't buy. He is attempting to live as far away from Silent Hill as possible as long as Heather can be driven there in a few hours, another plot point that didn't make sense, but must of evolved for movie time sake.So after tearing the film apart, why would I rate it 5 stars? Because I loved it. The horror aspect was done well. They made effective use of darkness, shadows, strobe effects, background noises, whispers, and deformed faceless humans. It is the same reason we watched a dozen or so Jason, Freddie, Puppet Master, or ""Hellraiser"" films long after they became trite.There were two great scenes that come to mind in this film: the spider was well done, and the arms through the prison bars scenes I also loved.

But alas, that ended up not happening. I did not enjoy Silent Hill: Revelation much at all. There were some things that conflicted with the events of the first film, and the dialogue in this one was so awful in so many places I literally cringed. The story was confusing (partially because some things conflicted with the events of the first film, as previously stated) and not paced well at all, there were also some things they brought in early on that seemed like they'd play a role that really ended up not being used at all. There were a couple of suspenseful parts, though, but they only lasted for a few short moments, and Sean Bean and Adelaide Clemens did well in their roles despite the awful dialogue. But overall, Silent Hill: Revelation is just not a good movie, it did a lousy job of following up the first movie.

There are some nice effects of characters/creatures such as Pyramid Head and Nurses from the original Konami game, but the story is incoherent with events that happen randomly. The slow-paced film does not develop characters or build up tension. It does not even bother to scare us.In addition to Sean Bean, some of the original film's players come back, which only makes me want to go back to the first ""Silent Hill"" film.

But it failed tonight. My initial opinion was flawed based upon past experience and my Asus G74sx having some kind of software conflict. Assume the conflict was with Opera, Safari (both work famously in Windows 8), Java, Corel WinDVD. Did a System Restore Point. Viola! The Asus laptop was back to true 3D.In the mean time I took the gentlemen's word and played Silent Hill 3D on my LG 47"" passive 3D TV. The Silent Hill 3D Was awesome. The colors vibrant. The 3D exceptional. The fine gent knew what he was talking about.I wrote what I saw. I never suspected my Asus G74sx was in conflict with another program causing my Asus G74sx to play 3D only with anaglyph glasses. Have Blu-Ray 3D films that are only to be used with anaglyth glasses.The above is my correct opinion of Silent Hill 3D. Perhaps, the best 3D FX I have ever seen.This movie is a teen girls Saturday night screamer.This film satisfied my 3D hunger.It ain't bad. It is a Friday night,  teenage girls scream kinda flick. Flashes of brilliant 3D gadgetry set amid a ridiculous premise.Like 3D so I bought this release as soon as I could due to 3D hunger. Places, even in the mall, Happy Burgers there was no color whatsoever. The zombie looking customers were in black and white.There is no color in this movie. Everything is set at night or in dark places. They made no effort to put forth a really good visual product.This movie is only in 3D with anaglyph, red/blue/green lenses glasses. The studio did not even provide anaglyph glasses. How cheap is that? And one would assume the disc would be for shutter/passive 3D viewing,I have seen many a porn in 3D and the porn 3D is vastly better 3D. The disc Properties revealed 43.5 GBs were used to make this flick. Go to wikipedia.org, type in anaglygh 3D. Take a look at 3D a century ago. It is light years better than it is now. A few big name stars in there. How embarrassing for them to be in such pathetic entertainment. But the show must go on so the rent and groceries will be paid.If you are a 3D junkie, this film is good enough to buy. If not, save your money for real 3D during the day.I do not recommend this movie.
