This is nothing more than an excrutiatingly painful ripoff of When a Stranger Calls (Even the title sucks like a hoover), there aren't enough words to describe it's total suckiness.If you like a pointlessly bad slasher flick that involves the butchering of children, a psycho who's got the hots for a girl who doesn't like him, and like lots of unnecessary gore all around, have at it.  I don't think these movies need to be this graphic and disgusting to be entertaining but, then again, this one doesn't have a leg to stand on in that department either.  Terrible acting, a bad script, lousy effects, and sorry, but Rebekah Kochan is not that hot looking.  All this movie is is an exercise in disturbing images and lots of irritating screaming.  To say I hated every moment of this piece of crud is an understatement.  You can spend 90-some minutes of your time doing something more productive...like cleaning dog crap off the lawn.",1,It's Official.

977192,A3ARVMKYWQ0X3S,B000EQ5V22,"DaveP ""dpags""","[7, 7]","This is one of those movies from the studio known to put out similarly titled and themed DVD's to conveniently coincide with the real studio release movie. In this case we get When a Killer Calls, ripping on the Sony remake of When A Stranger Calls (2006). The movies are about an isoltaed teen babysitter getting terrorized by a prank caller. While Stranger was rated PG-13, Killer is unrated offering up graphic violence, nudity and language. Killer is obviously low budget, with passable-at-best special effects for the gore, though the acting is surprisingly decent for the most part. The storyline differs just enough from Stranger to keep them from getting sued, but it's your standard cliche slasher fare. I was expecting MUCH worse though.The disc quality itself is pretty bad. Picture quality is anamorphic widescreen though it's looks like VHS with it's fuzzy and color muted picture. Oddly enough the behind-the-scenes featurette looks a thousand times better than the movie. Maybe it was a stylistic choice on the director's part? Regardless, don't go in expecting much in that area. Sound is decent and there's a few extras including the previously-mentioned behind-the-scenes, some outtakes, previews and a commentary track.",3,Actually not that bad for a blatant ripoff movie,1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,1238,"['one', 'movies', 'studio', 'known', 'put', 'out', 'similarly', 'titled', 'themed', 'DVD', 'conveniently', 'coincide', 'real', 'studio', 'release', 'movie', 'case', 'get', 'When', 'Killer', 'Calls', 'ripping', 'Sony', 'remake', 'When', 'A', 'Stranger', 'Calls', '2006', 'movies', 'are', 'isoltaed', 'teen', 'babysitter', 'getting', 'terrorized', 'prank', 'caller', 'Stranger', 'was', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'Killer', 'unrated', 'offering', 'up', 'graphic', 'violence', 'nudity', 'language', 'Killer', 'obviously', 'low', 'budget', 'passable-at-best', 'special', 'effects', 'gore', 'acting', 'surprisingly', 'decent', 'most', 'part', 'storyline', 'differs', 'just', 'enough', 'Stranger', 'keep', 'getting', 'sued', 'standard', 'cliche', 'slasher', 'fare', 'was', 'expecting', 'MUCH', 'worse', 'though.The', 'disc', 'quality', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Picture', 'quality', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'looks', 'VHS', 'fuzzy', 'color', 'muted', 'picture', 'Oddly', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'thousand', 'times', 'better', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'was', 'stylistic', 'choice', 'director', 'part', 'Regardless', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'much', 'area', 'Sound', 'decent', 'few', 'extras', 'including', 'previously-mentioned', 'behind-the-scenes', 'outtakes', 'previews', 'commentary', 'track']",N/A

977195,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B000EQ5V22,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[2, 2]","What happens when you have a ripoff of an all-time classic horror movie named ""When A Stranger Calls"" (closer to the inferior remake than original classic though), really bad almost laughable acting, rigid action, rather amateurish graphic violence, and really cheap production values?  Well, the answer of course would be ""When A Killer Calls"".""When A Killer Calls"" does not even attempt to differentiate itself from ""When A Stranger Calls"".  Although as I said, the feel of this movie is closer to the remake of ""When A Stranger Calls"" (which was not good in and of itself) as opposed to the classic.  The creators of ""When A Killer Calls"" very obviously felt that what was missing from ""When A Stranger Calls"" was the lack of on-screen violence and violence towards children.  To each his own, but I beg to differ with them on that issue.  One of the darkly magical qualities about the original ""When A Stranger Calls"" was the movie's ability to be so incredibly suspenseful and scary with almost zero on-screen violence.  When will they all learn?  A great scary movie is all about a good story, establishing mood and atmosphere, suspense, style mixed with substance, creativity, setting and good characters.  If you take out the babysitting urban legend (which is a good story), basically, ""When A Killer Calls"" has nothing to offer...certainly none of the qualities that are essential to a good horror movie that I just mentioned above.So, to categorically compare ""When A Killer Calls"" to the original ""When A Stranger Calls"" is not even constructive because there is no comparison.  The original ""When A Stranger Calls"" is scary whereas this generic regurgitated rubbish is not.  As I eluded to, ""When A Killer Calls"" contains very little suspense, no twists (of any significance) and nothing to call its own unless you like to see violence towards children; and to hear a very fake knife sound ripping into flesh; and finally to have your oh-so common lame sex scene between two time-killing pointless body bag stuffers.  Well, if that's worth your money, then knock yourself out, but that's about all there is to ""When A Killer Calls"".  Basically, this movie just succeeded in taking the scary out of this very effective urban legend and replacing it with some rather lame attempts to shock and disturb.  One Star for this particular lame and bland version of an effective urban legend (hard to screw this up but they did) made famous by ""When A Stranger Calls"", and zero to the movie itself.

We start out with some girl who is targeted by some guy in her house, he chases and captures her, takes some pics on his cell phone then kills her. That's our opening sequence folks. Later we see another young woman named Trisha arrive by bus to take a babysitting job, then we're treated to an overlong sequence of her walking through some woods and deserted streets while she's on her phone.Shortly after she arrives at the house, phone calls and odd things begin happening during the night, clearly it's obvious this guy likes Trisha but just how to impress her? Well call and disturb her and commit more violent acts, I mean what other way would there be to wow the girl of your dreams? This is clearly a big time rip off of the remake of ""When A Stranger Calls"", which as others have pointed out wasn't very good at all.I mean in comparison to that flick ""When A Killer Calls"" is much more violent, some shots of the killer killing his earlier victims were a bit unsettling.
