The happy results were that we both so enjoyed the movie that we have decided to buy our own copy. We have discovered that rental is an efficient way of disposing of movies that are not good or just worth one watching tops.This movie ""introduces"" the young 13 year old Keira Knightley as the young Judith and I will admit it took some mental adjustment when the Judith character was suddenly played by Emily Mortimer although she also does a compelling job as the older Judith. Having made the adjustment I do not expect to have to do that again.There are some nude scenes involving sexual situations which make this movie unsuitable for children; I would not show it to any but adults. These scenes are relatively brief and are part of the development of the story.The relationship between Colonel Edgar Carey-Lewis, played by Peter O'Toole and his wife Diana Carey-Lewis, played by Joanna Lumley is handled with touching skill; I was touched by the poignancy of their marriage and their determination to make the best of it.If you enjoy English drama set during WW II you will likely enjoy this one too; I know we did!",5,An Enjoyable Mini-Epic,1282089600,"08 18, 2010",2010,1282,"['watched', 'rental', 'copy', 'movie', 'request', 'wife', 'who', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'had', 'not', 'was', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'background', 'happy', 'results', 'were', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'have', 'decided', 'buy', 'own', 'copy', 'have', 'discovered', 'rental', 'efficient', 'way', 'disposing', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'just', 'worth', 'one', 'watching', 'tops.This', 'movie', 'introduces', 'young', '13', 'year', 'old', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'young', 'Judith', 'will', 'admit', 'took', 'mental', 'adjustment', 'when', 'Judith', 'character', 'was', 'suddenly', 'played', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'also', 'compelling', 'job', 'older', 'Judith', 'Having', 'made', 'adjustment', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'have', 'do', 'are', 'nude', 'scenes', 'involving', 'sexual', 'situations', 'make', 'movie', 'unsuitable', 'children', 'would', 'not', 'show', 'adults', 'scenes', 'are', 'relatively', 'brief', 'are', 'part', 'development', 'story.The', 'relationship', 'Colonel', 'Edgar', 'Carey-Lewis', 'played', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'wife', 'Diana', 'Carey-Lewis', 'played', 'Joanna', 'Lumley', 'handled', 'touching', 'skill', 'was', 'touched', 'poignancy', 'marriage', 'determination', 'make', 'best', 'it.If', 'enjoy', 'English', 'drama', 'set', 'WW', 'II', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'one', 'too', 'know', 'did']",N/A

Having read the other viewers' reviews, I gather that true Pilcher novel fans might be disappointed in the film.  For others, who just want an entertaining few hours, this might do well.  I picked it up because Peter O'Toole's face was on the cover and I figured he wouldn't be a part of anything that was too bad.The story covers a period in the life of a young girl, Judith Dunbar, as she enters boarding school in England when her mother and sister go to Singapore to join her father.  It is in the years leading up to WWII.  (In the early scenes she is played by the radiantly gorgeous young Keira Knightly.)  At school she becomes best friends with Loveday Carey-Lewis, a spirited girl from a fabulously wealthy family in Cornwall.  She spends most of her holidays with this family and they take her in as one of their own. We are treated to magnificent views of the area and the pleasures of the lifestyle of the privileged.  Peter O'Toole plays a small role as the father of Loveday but he steals every scene he appears in.  It's almost worth sitting through the very long video to see him.Joanna Lumley is almost his equal as his glamourous, amazing wife.The story progresses as Judith matures, and faces the problems that beset a young woman. (The transition from Keira Knightly to the much less beautiful Emily Mortimer is a shock, but we soon grow used to her and come to admire her excellent moral qualities, which sort of make up for the lack of luster.)  When the war breaks out life changes for everyone and the difficulties become enormous.  At one point I wondered how poor Judith could take one more blow, but she shows, as they all do, the amazing quality of staunch fortitude for which the British have become famous.  One of the main things I took away from the video was the experience of everyday people during that war.  As an American who has not had any first hand experience with war, I am truly humbled to think of what others have endured.There are some moments which, for me, were overly melodramatic, most notably the suicide.  And it seemed that Judith's choice of eventual mate was telegraphed early on in the film so there was no surprise there.  (I understand that it was different in the book.)This is not Shakespeare and if you don't expect King Lear you might be pleasantly surprised by an earnest presentation of a story that contains some interesting characterizations of what could have been real people in an era not that far removed from our time.

I never read the book, but I sure could tell they had to butcher the heck out of it to compress it down to two episodes.  Why so short?  Did the BBC cut off the funding?  I mean, when you have The Pallisers and The Dutchess of Duke Street and Upstairs Downstairs all even today getting rave reviews for their 26 episodes, what in the world happened here?  Certainly the material is there.  It could easily have gone 26 episodes and joined the others in elite status.  Instead, this one just crashes and burns.  You are jumping from major storyline to another and there's no time to catch your breath.  The stunning difference between the daughter in the first episode and the second...supposedly just two years...is not at all believable.  One day she's a 12 year-old, the next she's in her twenties. Say what?  What a ""could have been"" this show is.  Don't call it a mini-series.  It doesn't even qualify for that.  The sad part is, it could have easily been a WWII version of ""The Shooting Party"" but falls flat.  In that one, they had to cut costs and eliminated what happened in the Big War to the cast.  But we get that here, the problem is, it is all so fast and what happens to them is so major, there is no time for adequate character development.  Sorry, folks, I really tried.

I finally saw this drama being offered as an instant watch on a movie rental website I subscribe to and it was so interesting I watched it in one sitting (the show runs almost 3 hours and 20 minutes long).The story does deviate from the book in some ways, but the changes that are made never seem out of place, at least to me. A very young Keira Knightley plays teenager Judith Dunbar, who at 14 is sent to St. Ursula's, a private school. Her family (mom, dad, and younger sister Jess) move to Singapore, and Judith is left in the care of her Aunt Louise. It is at St. Ursula's that Judith becomes friends with rebellious teen Loveday Carey-Lewis (Katie Richardson). Both girls form a strong bond and this friendship propels Judith into a circle of wealth and privilege. Judith begins to spend her holidays with the Carey-Lewises at their palatial estate, Nancherrow, and through the course of the story, viewers get to see Judith blossom into a lovely, intelligent, yet vulnerable young woman (the adult Judith is played by the luminous Emily Mortimer). Judith's life takes many unexpected turns and she experiences tragedy, loss, heartache, and happiness.The casting for this production is excellent - Peter O'Toole plays Colonel Edgar Carey-Lewis; the radiant Joanna Lumley plays his much younger wife, Diana; Paul Bettany plays the playboy son Edward; George Asprey plays family friend Dr. Jeremy Wells; and David McCallum plays a creepy old man.The story stretches from before WW II to during and briefly after and is a sweeping family saga that does tend to get melodramatic at times, but the stellar performances, beautiful cinematography, and haunting score make this drama a rewarding watch.",5,A sweeping family saga with lots of charm,1310947200,"07 18, 2011",2011,1893,"['love', 'Rosamunde', 'Pilcher', 'works', 'favorites', 'are', 'Shell', 'Seekers', 'latest', 'on-screen', 'adaptation', 'starring', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'must-watch', 'fans', 'September', 'Coming', 'Home', 'finally', 'saw', 'drama', 'being', 'offered', 'instant', 'watch', 'movie', 'rental', 'website', 'subscribe', 'was', 'so', 'interesting', 'watched', 'one', 'sitting', 'show', 'almost', '3', 'hours', '20', 'minutes', 'long', '.The', 'story', 'deviate', 'book', 'ways', 'changes', 'are', 'made', 'never', 'seem', 'place', 'least', 'very', 'young', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'teenager', 'Judith', 'Dunbar', 'who', '14', 'sent', 'St.', 'Ursula', 'private', 'school', 'family', 'mom', 'dad', 'younger', 'sister', 'Jess', 'move', 'Singapore', 'Judith', 'left', 'care', 'Aunt', 'Louise', 'St.', 'Ursula', 'Judith', 'friends', 'rebellious', 'teen', 'Loveday', 'Carey-Lewis', 'Katie', 'Richardson', 'girls', 'form', 'strong', 'bond', 'friendship', 'Judith', 'circle', 'wealth', 'privilege', 'Judith', 'spend', 'holidays', 'Carey-Lewises', 'palatial', 'estate', 'Nancherrow', 'course', 'story', 'viewers', 'get', 'see', 'Judith', 'blossom', 'lovely', 'intelligent', 'vulnerable', 'young', 'woman', 'adult', 'Judith', 'played', 'luminous', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Judith', 'life', 'many', 'unexpected', 'turns', 'tragedy', 'loss', 'heartache', 'happiness.The', 'casting', 'production', 'excellent', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Colonel', 'Edgar', 'Carey-Lewis', 'radiant', 'Joanna', 'Lumley', 'much', 'younger', 'wife', 'Diana', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'playboy', 'son', 'Edward', 'George', 'Asprey', 'family', 'friend', 'Dr.', 'Jeremy', 'Wells', 'David', 'McCallum', 'creepy', 'old', 'man.The', 'story', 'stretches', 'WW', 'II', 'briefly', 'sweeping', 'family', 'saga', 'tend', 'get', 'melodramatic', 'times', 'stellar', 'performances', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'haunting', 'score', 'make', 'drama', 'rewarding', 'watch']",N/A
