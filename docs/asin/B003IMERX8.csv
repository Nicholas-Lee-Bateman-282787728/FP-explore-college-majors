This is because, from where I'm standing, the humor comes in the way of being so darn cute and adorable, that it basically gives me the impression I'm too old and mature to find any interesting qualities with the jokes.  In other words, this is teenage humor for those who think relationship humor actually has redeeming features.She's Out of My League features entirely unfunny characterization by every single person starring in the film.Jay Baruchel plays the part of a nerdy guy working at an airport.  He's in desperate need of a relationship with a woman.  He gets his big chance (eventually) and then the story kicks in and then... it just becomes a big unfunny, pointless and typical ""boy meets girl/boy falls in love with girl"" romance comedy from this point forward.  No humor anywhere in sight, I'm afraid.Only the one female friend of Alice Eve's character was funny, and that's only because she was extremely belligerent to everyone, including complete strangers on airplanes.Again, I found no humor anywhere so I didn't enjoy She's Out of My League.  None of Jay Baruchel's friends made me laugh either.  In fact they felt really tacked on and completely pointless except for in a few key moments of storytelling.Again, perhaps I'm just too old to appreciate this kind of humor, but then again, I didn't like it 10 years ago either.

Okay, so this time it centers on Kirk, played by Jay Baruchel, a totally unappealing, bumbling guy with a loser job and zero personality.  He's been dumped by a nasty, very average looking girl who wears too much makeup and meets Molly, played by Alice Eve, who is not only beautiful but nice (Sorry, but in my experience, most beautiful girls aren't very nice).  The surprise is that Molly, according to her friend Patti, is into him.  Um, yeah, Houston, we have a problem right here.  I'm not saying it couldn't happen, but when in the real world does a cross between Patsy Kensit, Nicole Kidman, and Reese Witherspoon with everything going for her fall for a guy with a dead end job, a family too eerily like mine, and a beat up car?  Not very often.That aside, I thought the movie humor was a bit gross, but it genuinely had me laughing at least 20 times.  Not bad, given the subject matter.  The shaving scene and the incident with the dog were too over-the-top gross in my book, but I thought the movie conveyed a great message.  If you don't think you're all that hot, how can you believe anybody else will?  Unrealistic or not, it was basically fun, but I wouldn't call it ""original"" as some people are claiming.  Mostly, it is a glimpse into how easily a person can perceive themselves based on the opinions of others, and the alternatives they can take to go against the grain.  That said, I just think better made movies get this point across with less awkwardness and crudeness.  Try Disney's The Princess Diaries or--god help me!--Encino Man.

Miller, Mike Vogel, Nate Torrence, Lindsay Sloane, Kyle Bornheimer, Jessica St. Clair, Krysten Ritter, Debra Jo Rupp, Adam LeFevre, Kim Shaw and Geoff StultsWRITTEN BY: Sean Anders and John MorrisDIRECTED BY: Jim Field SmithRated: RGenre: Romantic ComedyRelease Date: 12 March 2010Review Date: 11 March 2010Ever seen an action film with a character hanging onto something for their dear life, with a villain trying to pull them down by dangling from their leg? Of course you have. She's Out of My League is not an action flick, but it is a byproduct of this overly used cinematic scenario. It's clinging to the status of `good' by a measly thread, while the word 'mediocre' tugs eagerly at its leg.It reminded me of a watered down version of The 40-Year-Old Virgin. From the very first shot, the movie had the potential to be hilarious, and instead was just funny. One of the things that made The 40-Year-Old Virgin so enjoyable was the main character's obnoxious but realistic friends. She's Out of My League encases this concept nicely. Where it falls short, is in its lead character; not the actor but the character. He's not funny and the friends get all the laughs.I get that Kirk (Jay Baruchel) isn't supposed to be the funny guy; but neither was Andy in The-40-Year-Old Virgin. He simply was funny, because he was such an insecure weirdo, with a smothering oddness to him. Kirk is just pathetic and it takes the film down a notch. It's not Jay Baruchel's fault; he is hilarious. I've seen him in other comedy hits like Knocked Up and Tropic Thunder, and he killed. For whatever reason, he was being held back here. Luckily the things that happen to his character are amusing enough to hold our attention and make us still like the film.Kirk is working a foreseeable dead-end job as a TSA agent for an airline. We're told in act one that it's his dream to become a pilot, even though it's never brought up again in the remainder of the film. This could be due to his run-in with a very gorgeous girl, who comes through his security check-point. She has an affect that could very easily cause amnesia, to virtually every man that sees her in the film.Her name is Molly, and she's played by Alice Eve, who's gonna make it big for sure. Molly is a 10 and Kirk is a five. This is explained to Kirk and us, by his slap-stick Motley Crew of pals, that all work at the air-line with him.When Molly leaves her phone in security by mistake, and then calls it from the airplane, Kirk finds it and answers. He's her hero and she awards him with a dinner invitation. Not even suspecting that she could possibly be interested in him; he accepts.Kirk has just been dumped by his emotionally high maintenance girlfriend, Marnie (Lindsay Sloane). Marnie has taken such a liking to Kirk's parents that she continues to hang out with them even after she's began seeing someone else. Kirk thinks he wants her back, and there are some very hysterical scenes that take place between the two of them, Kirk's parents, and Marnie's irritating new boyfriend who has also become part of the family.I loved all of the side characters in the film. The friends are sincere with their intentions for their friend, and are a blast. Kirk's parents are adorable and his brother and his brother's girlfriend are ridiculously amusing. The problem is however, that we spend way more time with them, than we do with our two main characters.It almost seems like the supporting characters were given significantly more attention than Kirk and Molly, because they just seemed two-dimensional to me. Why were they attracted to each other? What was it about their relationship that justified them both fighting for it to survive the predictable third act split-up? The movie was like a delicious Thanksgiving Day feast, with all the tasteful sides; but with a PB&J; where the turkey should be.",4,She's Out of My League Review,1271894400,"04 22, 2010",2010,3919,"['SHE', 'OUT', 'OF', 'MY', 'LEAGUESTARRING', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'T.J.', 'Miller', 'Mike', 'Vogel', 'Nate', 'Torrence', 'Lindsay', 'Sloane', 'Kyle', 'Bornheimer', 'Jessica', 'St.', 'Clair', 'Krysten', 'Ritter', 'Debra', 'Jo', 'Rupp', 'Adam', 'LeFevre', 'Kim', 'Shaw', 'Geoff', 'StultsWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Sean', 'Anders', 'John', 'MorrisDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Jim', 'Field', 'SmithRated', 'RGenre', 'Romantic', 'ComedyRelease', 'Date', '12', 'March', '2010Review', 'Date', '11', 'March', '2010Ever', 'seen', 'action', 'film', 'character', 'hanging', 'something', 'dear', 'life', 'villain', 'trying', 'pull', 'down', 'dangling', 'leg', 'course', 'have', 'My', 'League', 'not', 'action', 'flick', 'byproduct', 'overly', 'used', 'cinematic', 'scenario', 'clinging', 'status', 'good', 'measly', 'thread', 'word', 'tugs', 'eagerly', 'leg.It', 'reminded', 'watered', 'down', 'version', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'very', 'first', 'shot', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'hilarious', 'instead', 'was', 'just', 'funny', 'One', 'things', 'made', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'obnoxious', 'realistic', 'friends', 'My', 'League', 'concept', 'nicely', 'Where', 'short', 'lead', 'character', 'not', 'actor', 'character', 'not', 'funny', 'friends', 'get', 'laughs.I', 'get', 'Kirk', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'guy', 'was', 'Andy', 'The-40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'simply', 'was', 'funny', 'was', 'such', 'insecure', 'weirdo', 'smothering', 'oddness', 'Kirk', 'just', 'pathetic', 'film', 'down', 'notch', 'not', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'fault', 'hilarious', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'comedy', 'hits', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Tropic', 'Thunder', 'killed', 'reason', 'was', 'being', 'held', 'back', 'here', 'Luckily', 'things', 'happen', 'character', 'are', 'amusing', 'enough', 'hold', 'attention', 'make', 'still', 'film.Kirk', 'working', 'foreseeable', 'dead-end', 'job', 'TSA', 'agent', 'airline', ""'re"", 'told', 'act', 'one', 'dream', 'become', 'pilot', 'even', 'never', 'brought', 'up', 'again', 'remainder', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'due', 'run-in', 'very', 'gorgeous', 'girl', 'who', 'security', 'check-point', 'affect', 'could', 'very', 'easily', 'cause', 'amnesia', 'virtually', 'man', 'film.Her', 'name', 'Molly', 'played', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'who', 'gon', 'make', 'big', 'sure', 'Molly', '10', 'Kirk', 'five', 'explained', 'Kirk', 'slap-stick', 'Motley', 'Crew', 'pals', 'work', 'air-line', 'him.When', 'Molly', 'phone', 'security', 'mistake', 'then', 'airplane', 'Kirk', 'answers', 'hero', 'awards', 'dinner', 'invitation', 'Not', 'even', 'suspecting', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'interested', 'just', 'been', 'dumped', 'emotionally', 'high', 'maintenance', 'girlfriend', 'Marnie', 'Lindsay', 'Sloane', 'Marnie', 'taken', 'liking', 'Kirk', 'parents', 'hang', 'out', 'even', 'began', 'seeing', 'someone', 'else', 'Kirk', 'back', 'are', 'very', 'hysterical', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'two', 'Kirk', 'parents', 'Marnie', 'irritating', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'also', 'become', 'part', 'family.I', 'loved', 'side', 'characters', 'film', 'friends', 'are', 'sincere', 'intentions', 'friend', 'are', 'blast', 'Kirk', 'parents', 'are', 'adorable', 'brother', 'brother', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'ridiculously', 'amusing', 'problem', 'however', 'spend', 'way', 'more', 'time', 'do', 'two', 'main', 'characters.It', 'almost', 'supporting', 'characters', 'were', 'given', 'significantly', 'more', 'attention', 'Kirk', 'Molly', 'just', 'seemed', 'two-dimensional', 'Why', 'were', 'attracted', 'other', 'What', 'was', 'relationship', 'justified', 'fighting', 'survive', 'predictable', 'third', 'act', 'split-up', 'movie', 'was', 'delicious', 'Thanksgiving', 'Day', 'feast', 'tasteful', 'sides', 'PB', 'J', 'where', 'turkey', 'should', 'be']",N/A

Kirk (the 5) is nothing special in the looks or career department, but he's a really nice guy, actually too nice as he's the kind of guy who gets used and will take all kinds of abuse while keeping a genuine smile on his face. Molly (the definite 10) is a blonde hotty who instantly turns every guys head and makes buku bucks as an upscale party planner (she's also a lawyer to meet Daddy's expectations). And also impossibly nice to boot. They end up on a date after a misplaced cell phone at the airport gets them together and things escalate on from there, in the usual roller coaster of events that this genre brings. Will they ultimately end up together? Probably not too hard to guess. The movie has some genuine laugh out loud moments, and there are a few crude ones worthy of the R rating, but this is actually a fairly heartfelt movie that will win you over, even if the last third becomes a by-the-book affair. Performances are spot on from the leads and all the supporting cast.The PQ is very nice on this. Colors are warm and nicely saturated. Detail is decent, particularly on clothing and the picture is pretty clean. Night scenes are well contrasted. On the AQ side, other than the scenes involving airplanes and the hockey game (which are represented very nicely in the LFE and directionality), things are your standard romcom soundtrack. Dialogue is always clear and even.A standard grouping of extras are here including a director's commentary, some deleted scenes and a blooper reel.

1346688,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B003IMERX8,David Baldwin,"[2, 2]","Pittsburgh, the city that brought you such stellar classics as ""Flashdance"", the George C. Romero Living Dead Trilogy, and ""The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh"" comes another gem.  The intentions of my review are twofold.  Primarily I want to herald the coming out of another screen goddess, Alice Eve.  There are not enough analogies in Wayne and Garth's vocabulary to describe Alice's gorgeousity.  She is a throwback to silver screen icons Lana Turner, Grace Kelly, and Kim Novak and in a league with today's screen beauties Katherine Heigl, Anna Faris, and Elizabeth Banks.  Alice could coast here on her stunningly good looks but that's not the case here.  Alice combines a sultriness with a sweet nature that's endearingly fresh.  No Barbie Doll she, Alice has some self-deprecating fun with her unnatural beauty.  I'll follow Alice anywhere except to ""Sex and the City 2"" which I wouldn't watch on a bet.  Stylistically the film takes a riff from Apatow where an Average Joe(Jay Baruchel) through happenstance finds himself in a romance with Alice's stunner.  The film reminds me of the masterwork, ""Knocked Up"" with Baruchel serving as a Seth Rogen surrogate.  The film is sweet and wouldn't work without the palpable screen chemistry between Baruchel and Eve.

1346690,ANGCVJN6WLN2O,B003IMERX8,"Dennis Bey ""DB""","[2, 4]","Most people nowadays mock religion policies, as a set of outdated rules and ridicule protocols, they would never be constricted by.  This movie uses one single phrase of the many stupid, ignorant generalizations and conclusions we have fabricated.  This group of norms holds us back from realizing our full potential.  But protect us from the big boogeyman, the punisher of failure in our own heads.  And all blissfully incognizant of the fact that we live enslaved by a non- written book of ignorant regulations, protocols, policies, rituals, etc.Philosophy aside, the movie represents a trend in comedy to cut the crap, brainstorm and truly improvise when writing.  These writers are really having fun again. We can feel their uniqueness, and they are funny as our quirky, special friends are funny. And their material feels fresh and genuinely funny, peppered with new twists.  You don't feel you are regurgitating while laughing.  They are tossing aside the ""tried and true"" trite formulas, or at least using only bits and pieces.For instance, after the hangover, unrenowned actors became a good choice.  One movie or producer or company, dared to move outside the prevalent practice and succeeded.  What other rules maybe just there, that because ignorance and fear of the uncharted, have not been proven wrong?.The same applies for all these stupid social conventions and limitations.  The movie is a simple invitation to dare us to test these assumptions.  Worst case scenario, we fail.  And we probably would have more fun that another socially accepted, successful move, within the maze.Best case scenario, we become one of the great minds, the revolutionaries, the guys that just confronted the general fears and tried something outside the box. On the other hand, we just may end with something better that what we would have settled for in our love life (the best organic thing we have, in this shiny materialistic feast we have going on).Particularly about women and relationships, there a some smart, substantial women out there, brave enough to break the rules and enjoy the company of someone with just an excellent personality, that enhance the joy in their lives.And some men also as well have seen the light, ladies.I am very sad,  I walked through this maze all this years, believing all this crap.

Out of his league had a lot to do with the other aspects of her life - not just her looks.  That was just completely glossed over in the movie.  That he makes her laugh is pretty much all it had going for it - or for him.I think the main problem I had with the movie was the last 1/2 hour or so.  The whole airport scene at the end wasn't funny at all.  I listened to the director's commentary and he said that they took ""liberties"" with what would really happen in an airport (security I mean).  Really?  No!?  The problem with some movies is that when they take you too far out of what is possible or real - you basically leave the story and the movie.  The movie is supposed to get you involved and immersed (at least a good one does) so when crazy things (that are NOT funny) happen - it just takes you out of the movie.So the ending was just so slap stickish (it was meant to be) that is was just silly.  This reminded me of a mystery dinner theater we went to.  A lot of the ""acting"" was to have the actors run around the dinner area chasing each other.

What would happen if a socially awkward nice guy who is a Joe Nobody is approached by a ""high end"" gorgeous woman?  Will the stress of trying to hold onto her devour him?  Will his lack of confidence be his undoing?  Will the universe self-destruct due to this outrage?  These and all the corollary questions are addressed in the current film.To make matters worse for the poor chap, the woman's ex is a sauve fighter pilot jock who wants her back.  Typically, this is not good news for average Joe types.  The best thing our average Joe has going for him is that he's a nice guy.  Unfortunately, as nice guys have found through the ages, this is not something he's normally able to use as a ""trump card.""Alice Eve has ""got the goods"" and easily portrays the sort of dreamgirl that we mere mortals spend our nights dreaming about.  She's also a fine actress and there is no gray matter as to why her career is taking off as she's quickly becoming a rising star.  I'm thinking that she'll be a household name within the next 5yrs or so.The people who have given this movie negative reviews have dismissed it as an unrealistic juvenile fantasy.  Fair enough, but.....what did they expect, exactly?  It's the unconventional situation of the supermodel caliber woman going after an average Joe which is precisely what gives the film its funniest moments.On a deeper level, the story is something of a satire on how we have our preconceived conventions, perceptions and expectations.  Sometimes that can sabotage our relationships with each other.  There are times when it's best just to let well enough alone & not over analyze things;  we humans have a tendency to make things more complicated than they need to be in all aspects of our lives.In any case, in the 4.3 billion year history there have been approximately 3 instances of a nice guy taking on a ""Biff"" and winning the girl of his dreams.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 1]","SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE (2010) is one of those near-American-Pie type things that may revolt you in the first quarter, but I say stick with it. It has profound teachings about how we see ourselves and each other in matters of love.The inexplicable Jay Baruchel finally has a role in which he at least has to explain himself a bit when he lands a fantastically beautiful girlfriend (who is on the rebound). He is a TSA airport attendant, and is surrounded by goofy-but-attractive friends who aren't what they seem.All of this is a good thing, and the comedy is also somewhat salty - dare I say, it is for good reason, and this film unfolds very well indeed. The humor is side-splitting at times; at other times it may be more meditative and profound than you think. Everything from ""10"" to the weird early films of Nicholas Cage is evoked here. The comedy is wacky, a bit off kilter, so much fun. And the stunning Mike Vogel (THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS) is simply astonishing to the eyes.It's not clear how Baruchel can hop from I'M REED FISH to THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE (vid. my reviews) to this without most of the viewership laughing at him instead of with him - he just doesn't seem to fit quite right in anything they give him. Yet I have anointed him ""the next Nicholas Cage"", because I see that is where Hollyweird is leading us.This is a fun film, but if you have no actor in this you are attached to seriously, I wouldn't buy it. It's just not that deep, nor is it really that funny. Let me warn you, the R rating is well deserved.

Most romantic comedies could be written by brain-dead zombies and have more originality. After watching hours of that drivel (my wife likes them),She's Out of My Leaguewas refreshing. For the first time in far too long, I laughed out loud at a romantic comedy. The movie was genuinely funny, meaningful, and not always predictable.Despite the scenario ((hot girl, deadbeat guy),She's Out of My Leaguedoesn't peddle the usual bromides about ""love being blind"" or ""good things happen to good people."" Rather, it's about self-esteem. This makes the characters and plot more interesting and subtle. I'm not going to claim that there's Oscar-winning character development inShe's Out of My League, but Molly, the hot girl, and Larry, the not so hot guy, do seem like realistic personalities. Larry does not ""refashion"" himself into a stud (although there is one incident with shaving a certain area...). Molly isn't the ""perfect"" hot girl, but has insecurities of her own and a need to play it safe. They're helped by a decent script with dialogue that doesn't seem too forced or awkward (except for the cursing - see below). It is kind of possible to see why they fall in love with each other - it makes sense in a way that most romantic comedies don't.My only problem with the movie is the overload of cursing and sex references. I understand that's standard fare in most comedies nowadays. Frankly, I found most of it funny. Sometimes, however, it just became too much (how many times do you really need to drop the f-bomb? You don't actually need it to express anger in every scene). It got to a point where it seemed like the scriptwriters couldn't think of anything better to fill the space. Fortunately, this doesn't take away from the movie too much, but it might not be a good idea to watch this with anybody who's sensitive about those sorts of things.She's Out of My Leaguehad real potential, and I'd like to see more work from this set of directors, scriptwriters, and actors (well, maybe better scriptwriters).

Without giving too much away for those who have not seen the film, there are certain elements of the plot that are so predictable, it's almost frustrating to sit through. In a film like this, one doesn't expect to be completely shocked by the turn of events, but everything here is based on cliches that should have ended with the Brat Pack films back in the '80s.I also have a problem with a lot of these comedies in general, the Apatow ones included: the women are expected to be really beautiful and the men are allowed to be total slobs.

It is simply a film about a typical man that is being pursued by a hot girl and how his uneventful life is changed forever by the situation.When I saw the trailer, I just thought the whole basis of the movie was so cute. Kirk Kettner is a typical man who works as a TSA officer at the airport with his strange male childhood friends. He wanted to go to college, but didn't because his father decided to use his college fund to buy a swimming pool. He wants to be a pilot, but lacks the self assurance to take flying lessons. He wants his old girlfriend back because he feels her mean behind is better than nothing, but she does not want him back because she has a new boyfriend who is dumb as a nail but owns a Pizza Hut Express. Kirk drives a rusty old car and his family likes his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend more than they like him.Enter Molly, the hot perfect ten girl who is a successful party planner (with a law degree) who speaks French, hangs out with the ""in"" crowd and has the hook-up on tickets to everything in town. Her perfect boyfriend has cheated on her and now she just wants a guy with whom she can be herself. Through a chance meeting at the airport, Molly finds that Kirk is funny, kind, brave, and chivalrous and she is attracted to him. And then all the fun begins with their friends telling them it can never work because a ""5"" and a ""10"" just don't hook up in this world.The movie is quirky.

After watching it (twice) I don't get all the crying about the ""F-Bomb"" references and all that.  It's not much different than most people I've seen, especially one's who work at airports (which I did).  And there must be a few annoyed lawyers out there who don't like this movie because they keep saying that ""Molly"" is a lawyer, which she's not.  She quit that whole idea and is an event planner.  Funny that there are at least two other reviews that mention she's a lawyer and seem put out about her being with the ""loser"" character.I think all the characters in the movie are believable enough to be enjoyable and I'm very happy I own it.

1346708,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003IMERX8,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","If you're like me and you've got the self-esteem of a 50-year-old waiter working at Denny's, it's nice to have a movie like SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE come out once in a while to keep the suicide rate of nerds everywhere at an even keel. You watch this film, and you dare to dream that a loser like yourself can bag a hottie like Molly solely with your vaguely ordinary looks, your nice guy loser etiquette, and your keen mastery of the Dewey Decimal system.Kirk (Jay Baruchel) is an average shmoe, working airport security in Pittsburgh, and most unlucky in love. Kirk has just tried - and failed - to get back with his horrible ex-girlfriend, and it's a statement to how much Kirk allows himself to get kicked to the curb that his ex-girlfriend repeatedly hangs out with Kirk's parents... and she's always bringing her new boyfriend. So you can't blame Kirk's oddball circle of friends and relations from wondering just what the hell is up when Kirk - who on the hotness scale ranks as a 5 or 6, tops - lands a gorgeous, successful, sophisticated 10 like Molly (Alice Eve).There's a core of sweetness to SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE, but on the surface it is a raunchy watch, but not because the cast is steamily sexing it up left and right. There are moments where the film feels like it got Judd Apatowed. The rowdy comes from certain awkward situations which surface (ala THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY) and the many potty-mouthed characters in the film who indiscriminately drop the ef-bomb. Kirk rolls with a bunch of wisecracking pals who from jump second guesses his new and unlikely relationship. Molly is just that hot and Kirk just that average (and, ergo, woefully outgunned). Will Kirk and Molly last? Or will real life come crashing in? Will Kirk listen to his skeptical friends, or his heart?In the audio commentary, Director Jim Field Smith compliments Jay Baruchel's comic physicality while observing that Baruchel is ""built like a baby giraffe."" The way Baruchel looks, with his weedy build, it's just begging for any girl to step on him, and then there's his adenoidal line delivery (which I actually dig). Baruchel demonstrates the necessary acting chops to make Kirk nerdy and yet salvageable enough that you can sort of squint real hard and suppose that maybe, just maybe, if the stars aligned just right, a guy like Kirk can land a hottie like Molly. It helps too that Alice Eve brings a down-to-earth quality that makes Molly really sweet and likable.This movie cracked me up. The supporting cast is quirky and hilarious and profane like a mothereffer, with Molly's cute best friend (a wonderful Krysten Ritter) vying with Kirk's best friend Stainer (T.J. Miller) for vulgarity honors. SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE can't help but hammer you with its message, because the ever sliding scale of self-regard and self-immolation is intrinsic to the plot. Ultimately, the film's advice boils down to: Hey, man, don't be such a Lay Down Larry. Anyway, sit back and giggle at the dysfunctional folks on the screen. You may even rock out (or not) to Stainer and his Hall & Oates tribute band. However, bear in mind that this is only a fantasy film, as are JUST FRIENDS and SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL. The chances of landing a hottie are very slim. If you're a 5 or a 6, then it might be safer to settle for a 5 or a 6, tops. If you're in a band, you can maybe score a hard 7. And if you want to feel like you're too hot and too good for your partner, then get yourself a 3. Also, don't dismiss Russian mail order brides as an option.The DVD's bonus material: audio commentary from Director Jim Field Smith; 4 Deleted Scenes and an Extended Ending (featuring the bitter ex-girlfriend); the blooper reel (00:06:20 minutes); ""Devon's Dating Show"" - A ""Do's & Don'ts"" guide to dating for guys, although, hilariously, that guy who plays Kirk's brother undermines Devon at every turn (00:07:28 minutes).",4,"Tale as old as time...

He's the fixer-upper who never gets the girls.  When graded by his friend Stainer (TJ Miller), the best Kirk can be is a 6 out of 10, and that's being generous considering his atrocious car.  It's Kirk's fortuitous encounter with Molly (Alice Eve), however, that begins to change not only his mind, but the opinions of his unsupportive friends and family.Filmed in Pittsburgh - Primanti Brothers and Mellon Arena are highlighted - the movie really comes off as genuine.  Sure, the hot chick never goes for the guy who is so skinny his nipples touch, but it was even less believable thanr that execrable disgraceThe New Guy; somehow it worked, and it even had a little Serendipity vibe to it.  Tal Bachman said it best with their definitive song: ""She's so high above me, she's so lovely.""  She's too good for him, yet realism oozes out of the movie.Perhaps it's because the actors played who they actually probably are in real life.  Alice Eve looks like she has always been the over-achieving cheerleading captain who buckles men's knees, so the role was probably not a stretch.  Similarly, there is no doubt in my mind that Jay Barachul has received multiple toilet swirlies in his time.  Stealing every scene, however, is TJ Miller.  What a cool, socially awareNapoleon Dynamitemight be, Miller is hilarious, and looks like the guy who got big laughs since he was a child.  For such a young, somewhat inexperienced cast, there are no lulls or weak links.The one glaring flaw in the screenplay (other than the aforementioned improbable skinny dude and hot chick connection) is an uncomfortable ball shaving scene - the most unbelievable scene in movie history.  Yes, more unbelievable than Ben Affleck as an oil worker who goes into outerspace as a temp astronaut to land on an asteroid and mine into it to deposit a bomb which will split the asteroid - which is the size of Texas - into multiple pieces that will narrowly miss the Earth and avoid an extinction level event.Fun, quick-moving, and worth the time.

The reason that it fell short of being a quality comedy, in my mind, was the guy that they picked as actor for the ""nerdy, yet nice"" airport guy.  It bothered me to watch him.  He just wasn't funny like the dork on Road Trip or ""Paul Finch"" in American Pie.  No personality -- at all.  I suppose that was the point.  But, I just got so bored watching him wander around pathetically.  He never became more cool, did not improve himself and gain confidence, or ever really have the awakening that I had hoped would happen.Instead, we see a conclusion with the dork flying a two-seater airplane and being proud of his accomplishment.  Lovely.  Meanwhile, he has a smoking hot girlfriend who makes six figures and is a highly educated lawyer.  Does anyone believe this plot?  Or, more importantly, does anyone find it appealing even though not believable?  I don't.  It wasn't funny in the way that Wedding Crashers, American Pie, Employee of the Month (which, although very stupid, was better than this movie), etc. was funny.  It just missed the mark entirely.It made me want to vomit watching the fat (seemingly gay, yet straight) friend shave the geeky guy's sack.  Freaking nasty even to see that guy with his shirt off.  This scene should have been cut.I felt like the supporting actors had a few good one-liners.  If they had expanded on that part of it (like the actors did in Employee of the Month), I would have really enjoyed it.

Okay, so we've seen it a gazillion times before, right? Ugly, ""hard five out of ten,"" nerd-guy gets the hot chick. Does that happen in real life? Rarely, if at all...young women like that are, on a typical basis, highly conceited, to the point of the conceit being so over-the-top that it overshadows any good looks they may actually possess, and in the process, making them uglier than the nerd-girls. In Hollywood, though, it seems to happen ALL of the time...those lucky nerd-guys!In this case, the woman's (the remarkably gorgeous Alice Eve) conceit is prevalent, but coupled with humility, lands on a much lesser scale than the typical narcissistic hottie, and the nerd-guy (the very talented Jay Baruchel) experiences a high-level inferiority complex whenever he is with her.What makes this movie stand out above the others of similar fare is, far and above, the exceptional casting. EVERY actor is perfect for his or her role...the nerd buddies, the hottie's girlfriends, the moms and dads and the rest of the families. I will reiterate, EVERY actor is exceedingly perfect for their role.  The story line moves with a pace that is easy to travel with. I didn't even want to get up to get a drink without pausing the movie first, simply because I didn't want to miss anything. ""She's Out Of My League"" was rife with one-liners and crazy comedy in addition to a wonderfully told and acted storyline. Throughout the movie you'll find yourself pulling for the poor nerd as he experiences feelings and emotions he has never had to experience, especially when he has to deal with said feelings and emotions.

The guy who plays Kirk, of course, was one of his buddies in Knocked Up.  What was I expecting other than something else based on the title?  No not really.  He could not carry this movie by himself, but it was an honest effort on a cinematic scale.  That being said, this movie was mediocre at best in terms of the plot and script, when an average guy Kirk meets and actually has a beautiful, successful, wonderful woman named Molly fall for him.  What should be a dream come true for him actually turns into a bit of a nightmare, since his friends and family can't believe that this woman actually wants to be with him.  His brother actually asks her ""What are you doing with numbnuts here?"", his ex girlfriend was/is astonished that he is capable of attracting such a woman and it therefore makes him more attractive to him again, his friends are also giving him a hard time.  Since this is a romantic comedy at heart, I don't have to tell others how it ended since you can probable guess.This movie, however, is actually a rather sad commentary on the world today.  Did you know that women are now earning more undergraduate / master's degrees than men?  Did you know that half of the married women today (despite their level of education) are the bread winners of their households?  Did you also know that men feel emasculated by this?  If you don't, then you have another thing coming and you haven't dated at all.  All of that YOU CAN DO IT push in the 80s and 90s made women better, but it also made the men softer.  And also guess what?  Men have much lower self esteem than you thought they did.  They may act as if they are tough and rough, but they are actually much more insecure than you ever thought possible.  And they choose to end it with the Mollys of the world by treating them horribly, because it's easier for guys like Kirk to tell Molly that there is something wrong with them rather than acknowledging their own faults.  Because of these factors, they pick someone who is lesser than they are.  They want someone who earns less, is less intelligent, has less personality and charisma.  You are, quite honestly, out of their league.  As for the ones that they do choose, they choose a trashy woman who is so eager to have someone in their lives that they are willing to put up with and care for them, put up with their bad behaviors.  And then after that falls apart, the Kirks look back on the Molly they attracted and wondered why they had to be so rotten to that woman who was so nice and good and, quite honestly, perfect.Sounds bitter?  I wish I could say otherwise.  Thanks to Facebook, I found a few from the past who affirmed this to be true.  ""You were so good, I wish it could've been different.""  Well, it's not.  Self esteem is a gift, as is Molly's love, and Kirk treats it like garbage in order to make himself feel better, not be embarrassed by his friends/family, or break it off before she sees the light and breaks it off with a loser like him.  And that last part is the biggest loser statement of them all.  Ladies: Learn to love yourself.  There are a whole lot of men out there, and a whole lot of them are insecure losers, and you're better off alone rather than have that guy rip your self esteem apart to make them feel better.And with that, this movie was decent as well.",3,Romanic comedy / Real life,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,3481,"['started', 'watching', ""'d"", 'become', 'fan', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'recent', 'success', 'stoner', 'comedies', 'made', 'beaucoup', 'bucks', 'entertained', 'masses', 'guy', 'who', 'Kirk', 'course', 'was', 'one', 'buddies', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'What', 'was', 'expecting', 'other', 'something', 'else', 'based', 'title', 'No', 'not', 'really', 'could', 'not', 'carry', 'movie', 'was', 'honest', 'effort', 'cinematic', 'scale', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'mediocre', 'best', 'terms', 'plot', 'script', 'when', 'average', 'guy', 'Kirk', 'meets', 'actually', 'beautiful', 'successful', 'wonderful', 'woman', 'named', 'Molly', 'fall', 'What', 'should', 'be', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'actually', 'bit', 'nightmare', 'friends', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'woman', 'actually', 'be', 'brother', 'actually', 'What', 'are', 'doing', 'numbnuts', 'here', 'ex', 'girlfriend', 'was/is', 'astonished', 'capable', 'attracting', 'such', 'woman', 'therefore', 'more', 'attractive', 'again', 'friends', 'are', 'also', 'giving', 'hard', 'time', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'heart', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'tell', 'others', 'how', 'ended', 'can', 'probable', 'guess.This', 'movie', 'however', 'actually', 'rather', 'sad', 'commentary', 'world', 'today', 'Did', 'know', 'women', 'are', 'now', 'earning', 'more', 'undergraduate', '/', 'master', 'degrees', 'men', 'Did', 'know', 'half', 'married', 'women', 'today', 'level', 'education', 'are', 'bread', 'winners', 'households', 'Did', 'also', 'know', 'men', 'feel', 'emasculated', 'do', ""n't"", 'then', 'have', 'thing', 'coming', 'have', ""n't"", 'dated', 'YOU', 'CAN', 'DO', 'IT', 'push', '80s', '90s', 'made', 'women', 'better', 'also', 'made', 'men', 'softer', 'also', 'guess', 'what', 'Men', 'have', 'much', 'lower', 'self', 'esteem', 'thought', 'did', 'may', 'act', 'are', 'tough', 'rough', 'are', 'actually', 'much', 'more', 'insecure', 'ever', 'thought', 'possible', 'choose', 'end', 'Mollys', 'world', 'treating', 'horribly', 'easier', 'guys', 'Kirk', 'tell', 'Molly', 'something', 'wrong', 'rather', 'acknowledging', 'own', 'faults', 'factors', 'pick', 'someone', 'who', 'lesser', 'are', 'want', 'someone', 'who', 'less', 'less', 'intelligent', 'less', 'personality', 'charisma', 'are', 'quite', 'honestly', 'league', 'ones', 'do', 'choose', 'choose', 'trashy', 'woman', 'who', 'so', 'eager', 'have', 'someone', 'lives', 'are', 'willing', 'put', 'up', 'care', 'put', 'up', 'bad', 'behaviors', 'then', 'apart', 'Kirks', 'look', 'back', 'Molly', 'attracted', 'wondered', 'why', 'had', 'be', 'so', 'rotten', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'nice', 'good', 'quite', 'honestly', 'perfect.Sounds', 'bitter', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'otherwise', 'Thanks', 'Facebook', 'found', 'few', 'past', 'who', 'affirmed', 'be', 'true', 'were', 'so', 'good', 'wish', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'different', 'Well', 'not', 'Self', 'esteem', 'gift', 'Molly', 'love', 'Kirk', 'garbage', 'order', 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'not', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'friends/family', 'break', 'off', 'light', 'breaks', 'off', 'loser', 'last', 'part', 'biggest', 'loser', 'statement', 'Ladies', 'Learn', 'love', 'are', 'whole', 'lot', 'men', 'there', 'whole', 'lot', 'are', 'insecure', 'losers', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'alone', 'rather', 'have', 'guy', 'rip', 'self', 'esteem', 'apart', 'make', 'feel', 'better.And', 'movie', 'was', 'decent', 'as', 'well']",N/A

1346743,A16GM9G38VTJMV,B003IMERX8,RedConOne,"[0, 0]","She's Out of My League is a great movie for its genre. It has plenty of laughs but not so many where the movie didn't have substance to it. The movie has realism seeping from its pores in almost every aspect. To be honest the movie has a great meaning and moral to it that may make many viewers think differently when they discourage their friends or maybe make them think twice before turning down a date from someone because they don't quite fit your usual mold for a significant other. But I'll get to that later as I'm going to break this review up into multiple sections.A simple and short summary of the story is: Kirk (Jay) is an awkward skinny guy who is what many would consider fairly average. Hes a nice guy, who works airport security with his friends, he drives a crappy car, and isn't too popular with the ladies. When a attractive girl named Molly (Alice) leaves her cell phone in security he gets the opportunity to return it to her and as the attraction builds and they start to date. But he has to figure out who he is as the issues grow along with the jealous voices saying hes not good enough for her.The casting department did a great job as the acting was actually very good. There weren't any lulls or low points in the acting where you didn't feel like you were right there watching it all unfold. They did a great job matching the actors to the characters they would best fit. When you see Jay (plays Kirk) on the screen you could almost believe that in his younger days he was awkward around girls and not too confident. Alice (plays Molly) you can believe that shes had her fair share of guys who thought she was the finest thing to grace this planet. T.J. truly seems like he has been the comedian all his life providing comic relief and wise guy comments that don't necessarily help the situation but whom is there to help when the stuff truly hits the fan. Even the more minor roles seemed to fit the actor perfectly. When you see Mike (plays Jack) you can believe he is the type of guy who went through many meaningless relationships. Krysten (plays Patty) was hilarious when you saw her with her take no crap attitude and quick to tell you off temper. The actors just all seemed to fit and you can see it when you watch their non-verbal communication, everything from smiles and smirks to trying to warn someone not to say the scripted line (it felt real). In fact going off of that one of my favorite parts is when Kirk is at the airshow and is explaining to Molly his mishap, I love the reaction on Krysten's face in the background (even though she knew what he was going to say) her reaction was priceless and seemed like what you would expect a genuine reaction to be.The movie has a great message to its viewers. For those who may miss it I'll explain it for you and for those who would rather figure it out yourself please skip to the next paragraph. The movie has a couple meanings. Starting with self image, liking who you see when you look in the mirror. Kirk thinks little of himself and his thoughts seep out and affect his life. Due to his negative outlook he counts himself out before he even tries. The self image plays into the whole not putting a low number on yourself (if you so choose to rate yourself) because your a ten and are good enough for anyone. To be honest that meaning reminds me of a quote i once heard which is &#34;If you set a low value on yourself, you can't expect the world to raise your price.&#34; The movie tells you in no uncertain terms that your good enough for anyone because the only person you have to be good enough for is yourself. The realization comes at the point Molly says &#34;You were always good enough for me. You were just never good enough for yourself&#34;. Due to these themes the movie tackles how shallow we've become. The writers of the movie really want the viewer to realize that they are valuable, they are all &#34;hard 10s&#34; and that the only person you need to be good enough for is YOU.Now many have gone back and forth on the &#34;realism&#34; of the film. Specifically calling it unrealistic in the regards of the hot girl going for the normal guy. This debate is exactly what the movie points out is that everyone is so obsessed with the looks they never realize there is more to the people. I have a few friends who are with very attractive women and always the reason is more than just looks. As a relationship is based solely on looks it will fail. These relationships are based on personal connections, shared interests, valued traits, etc. See the movie is realistic in that Molly chose Kirk who she liked for more than his looks. It happens everyday folks. You also should realize that what you may consider a &#34;hard 10&#34; is not what someone else would consider a hard 10. Like when in the film they said Molly was the hottest girl ever or the film was making a fuss about her looks by having all the guys staring at her. I couldn't help but think is she hot? sure. But the hottest girl i've ever seen? No. Why? because everyone is different and what i think makes a girl a 10 (both physically and mentally) differs from that you or anyone else thinks makes a girl (or guy) a 10. See when you examine the realism of the films' moral (specifically the hot girl going for the average guy) you should also realize that its realistic because it happens everyday as someone's hard 10 agrees to a date (even is that 10 in your eyes is a 6). So keep that in mind.The only downside to the film is they never really elaborated on the rating system and how it works along with the way of getting a score for someone. They go into it a little in the first bowling scene but not really again after that. They never explain what makes Molly a 10 so it leaves the viewer assuming its only judged off of her looks. Even so what made her a 10 in the eyes of the movie and not a 8 or 9? I thought that the rating system since it played such an important role in the story should have been explained in more detail. The one other downside is they never developed the friendships too much. As you don't see a whole lot of Patty or Jack and i thought they could've developed those a little further.NOTE: This IS NOT a film for young viewers as it contains inappropriate situations and conversations and well to be clean a shaving scene that is not appropriate for younger viewers. So viewer discretion is advised.Overall. She's Out of My League is a great movie that has a good moral. Its funny yet with substance and will make the viewer walk away feeling good about themselves and who they are as a person. From me it earns 5/5 stars! It's a realistic feel good comedy that is definitely worth adding to your collection.",5,She's Out of My League,1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,6723,"['My', 'League', 'great', 'movie', 'genre',

I remember the previews when it was at the theaters and I was tempted to go see the movie just on the previews.I didn't. I just recently got a copy on DVD.I do have one small complaint. I tend to be a purist when it comes to buying copies of movies that I really like on DVD and I have seen this movie on cable several times and now on my DVD player.My complaint is why would the company that puts this movie on DVD advertise it as being on a ""widescreen"" format when they don't show you the movie the way it was originally shown at the movie theater?I was watching the movie carefully on cable and then on my DVD copy and my copy loses roughly an inch at the bottom of the screen. That is ridiculous. You buy the movie on ""widescreen"" because you have been told that that is the way the movie was filmed and presented orginally at the movie theaters.Well that is not true.I am buying a copy on Blue Ray next to see if on that I will lose some of the picture as I did on my regular ""widescreen"" DVD copy.I make a big deal about this because this movie really grew on me after watching it on cable several times and now on my ""not the whole movie as it was shown originally"" DVD copy.If anyone has this movie on Blue Ray now, please let me know if you're missing about an inch off the bottom of it. I want to know before I spend money on a Blue Ray copy, which I will probably windup doing anyway.Otherwise, this movie is hilarious. Not totally raunchy. Which was good. Great story. Believable situations with a few exceptions. The acting from everyone was very convincing and very good. Great actors. Great comedy.The female actresses were esp. notable. Great acting from them. The lead actress and the supporting actresses were really good. They were all funny. Those actresses used a lot of great body language on this movie to great effect. Their facial expressions and gestures were laugh-out-loud funny.In fact, the facial expressions, gestures and moments of stunned silence in this movie are some of the funniest ever.I'm pretty sure that the name ""Marnie"", one of the female characters in this very funny movie, was chosen from an old Alfred Hitchcock ""psychological thriller"" of the same name. If you look it up on Wikipedia, you'll get some clever background on the name.""She's Out of My League"" has a great soundtrack too.So watch out with any future purchases of movies on DVD that say ""widescreen"".

1346758,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B003IMERX8,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[4, 6]","I was surprisingly shocked at how good a film ""She's Out Of My League"" was. I went to the film as a guest at a sneek peek (the first time I had ever done this) and saw the movie theatre packed. I didn't expect much from the movie as there are no well-known actors in it and the genesis is that it's simply about young love in which most films with those kind of storylines can be boring and mundane. However, ""She's Out Of My League"" is a wonderful film about a guy (Kirk), played by Canadian born Jay Barachul (known for his role in ""Million Dollar Baby""), who is a security agent at the Pittsburgh Airport. He falls in love, and she with him, with a beautiful woman (Marnie), a lawyer. Both a very different. Kirk is basically a geek, not all that handsome, from a family of neanderthalls with the class of sewer rats, where Marnie is simply breathtaking in both her beauty and class. This is what makes the film: how two completely different people who are polar opposites can find each other attracted to the other. The movie is basically a romantic comedy made along the same lines as ""There's Something About Mary"". Kirk also has three best friends who do everything in their power to make Kirk more handsome and appealing to Marnie, with one going so far as to shave and trim Kirk's pubic hairs to make him look more ""advanced"". I swear when that scene was shown the theatre audience roared with laughter. The chemistry between the two stars is evident and the script funny, heart warming, with intelligent writing. The only known actor in the movie is stud Mike Vogel who plays Jack. He starred in the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and in the upcoming CBS series ""Medical Miami"". I also have to add that Alice Eve looks like a young Nicole Kidman before Nicole had all that horrendous plastic surgery. Alice could pass as Nicole's sister or daughter, that is how uncanny their resemblance in this film is. In all an A+ film that I enjoyed immensely. The film was shot on location at various locales in Pittsburgh which adds realism to the movie.

1346760,A2YW1TL9ZR3URI,B003IMERX8,"The Mad Bostonian ""Steve""","[0, 0]","Ok, you've read my other reviews and seen my review for the great 500 Days of Summer and how I pretty much lambasted all romantic comedies --- but how I really liked 500 Days of Summer. Well here's another comedy/ romantic that I enjoyed, weird...So here we go, I watched this one from Netflix... what can I say-- first off, I like Jay Barchuel, plays geeky, nerdy, regular Joe guy very well, I liked his friends in the movie, Stainer, Jack and Devon, his crazy brother and family. Most of the funny coming from his friends and situations with Kirk's family and a funny scene when him and Molly are kissing and her folks show up.Plot is simple: boy works as TSA at Pittsburgh Airport, tries to win back his ex g/f's heart, that broke up with him 2 years ago, he's still harping on that and think there is a sliver of hope, while his friends try to knock some sense into him into not doing it. Then comes Molly (Alice Eve) an extremely beautiful, killer smile, sweet, woman who for some reason takes a liking to Kirk (Jay) and a relationship blossoms but yet there is turbulence along the way, where Kirk has to deal with Molly's ex Pilot b/f Cam where Stainer casually says ""Yeah I'd have sex with him"", the movie makes Cam out to be a killer stud, someone like Kirk couldn't compete with in a million years, and then there is Kirk's self esteem issues, and short falls, that he he keeps questioning why is Molly with me, where you know the couple will eventually break up--- typical formulaic plot I would say.So through out the movie we get why, why, why, is a girl with a guy like him? She's a 10 from the point of Kirk and his friends where they view him merely a 5, from this scene it get's pretty funny where Kirk and his friends start rating each other, and points start to get deducted and added on and there's exemptions stuff like that, a clever, funny scene where the dialogue seemed to flow, like how late 20 somethings male friends would interact with each other. 'Cause maybe we can relate to this or know friends who have been in situations like this sort of, maybe that's why I liked this movie.The movie has some genuinely funny moments, warm-hearted moments, dialogue is good, wouldn't say the writing is as crisp or intelligent as 500 Days of Summer, comedy is more vulgar. Who hasn't been with someone and think why is he/she with me? and that what it is all about is people shouldn't care what their partner is or their short comings, what matters is, that they enjoy who they are with, you yourself has to have the self esteem, I am sure some will argue it's only a movie, but it's nice and refreshing to see a dork get the girl--- so curl up on the couch with your partner, you'll get some good laughs out of this one....Still doesn't mean I will see any Rom/Coms like Bounty Hunter, or those 10 other Rom/Com movies that Jennifer Anistan made that it seems her career has been relegated to if you haven't noticed, seems every movie she makes is some sort of Rom/Com now...

1346764,A3GTI1Z7YE49ZS,B003IMERX8,"Tnahpellee ""Brendan""","[14, 15]","'She's out of my league' is a movie that works. Rather than relying on tired dirty jokes and cliche's, and despite it's goofy looking promo poster, it is quite insightful into our shallow perceptions of relationships.Part of it's success is the main character, Kirk, is just very average and humble. He's not self-deprecating in a rediculous way, he's just very straight-forward, with a dose of low self-esteem. Even his more-attractive love affair, Molly, is a pleasant person, rather then some poster-girl stereo-type. Even better is the fat guy (forgotten his name) who's mature outlook helps him to lead a contented life. It's the good characters that make this movie worth watching.On the whole, everything is good; the dialogue is usually interesting, the jokes are ok, etc. As you can guess, the movie is about a really hot woman who starts falling in love with a man who considers himself unattractive.

The dialogue ruined it, though.If you like to hear the ""F- "" word every 2 minutes,  then is your kind of film!Another thing about this film, even though is a  Boy-meets-girl,  breaks-up- with-girl, and gets-girl-back type of film,  the good is it teaches young people toquit rating yourselfs as ""a ten"" or a ""five"".  I always have stressed that to youngerfolk (i'm 30).  Otherwise, personally, Hollywood is destroying the english-languagewith is profanity-laced films.  Message to Hollywood:  If you wonder why peopleare going less to the theaters,  watch your filthy lauguage and clean up your act.Hey, I'm a liberal male, and a socialist to boot - but by using the F word everytimeyou want to MAKE A POINT,  it not only shows how uneducated you are, but howshallow your vocabulary is.  Get educated! Read a dictionary for God's sake andmaybe you actually can produce a film where you can teach younger folks thatprofanity is not always the answer.Daniel J.

I was very surprised! It does have the typical male humor but women will like the romantic comedy feel as well. There were many laugh out loud moments & I loved the casting! They couldn't have put a more perfect group of people together. As for the claims on the DVD cover that this is another ""The Hangover"", I definately have to disagree. If you take a step back though, it does sort of remind you of the basic theme of 4 guys going through an experience together, just a very nerdy group of guys. That is where the comparison ends though. I would definately reccommend to anyone looking for a light, laugh out loud movie!",4,Surprisingly good,1280016000,"07 25, 2010",2010,767,"['honestly', 'had', 'interest', 'seeing', 'movie', 'However', 'thanks', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'watched', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'wanted', 'see', 'good', 'comedy', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'have', 'typical', 'male', 'humor', 'women', 'will', 'like', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'feel', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'many', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'loved', 'casting', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'put', 'more', 'perfect', 'group', 'people', 'together', 'claims', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Hangover', 'definately', 'have', 'disagree', 'take', 'step', 'back', 'sort', 'remind', 'basic', 'theme', '4', 'guys', 'going', 'experience', 'together', 'just', 'very', 'nerdy', 'group', 'guys', 'where', 'comparison', 'would', 'definately', 'reccommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'light', 'loud', 'movie']",N/A
1346768,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B003IMERX8,Westley,"[1, 1]","Based on the trailer, I expected ""She's out of My League"" to be another tired comedy that relied on raunch for humor.  I didn't initially plan on seeing it, but I like Jay Baruchel and the reviews have been fairly good.  The movie far exceeded my expectations.  Baruchel is perfectly cast as Kirk, an awkward young man who just wants a decent girlfriend.  Unfortunately, he's not very good looking (his friends say he's a 5 and she's a 10), his job with the TSA at the Pittsburgh airport is not exactly exciting, and he is pretty pathetic around women.  He harbors hope that his ex-girlfriend will get back together with him, but she's moved on years ago to another guy.  Kirk is not exactly prime dating material.  However, when he finds the lost phone of an attractive woman (Alice Eve as Molly), Kirk unexpectedly finds himself dating her.  He can't believe his luck, and along with the bad advice of his friends, he begins to question her motives.Baruchel is extremely likeable in this role, and the screenplay is surprisingly sweet at times.  Yes, there are some raunchy scenes (seemingly a prerequisite in current comedies), but the focus is on the interplay between the two leads and differences between how men and women view relationships.  Some of the scenes are genuinely funny, although there are some that fall flat, such as an extended bit where Molly's ex-boyfriend assumes that Kirk is gay.  ""She's out of My League"" is an above average comedy with some very good casting and relatively high likeability factor.  I hope it is a success because it would be good to see Baruchel in more leading parts.",4,When a 5 meets a 10,1268956800,"03 19, 2010",2010,1615,"['Based', 'trailer', 'expected', 'My', 'League', 'be', 'tired', 'comedy', 'relied', 'raunch', 'humor', 'did', ""n't"", 'initially', 'plan', 'seeing', 'like', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'reviews', 'have', 'been', 'fairly', 'good', 'movie', 'far', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'Baruchel', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Kirk', 'awkward', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'decent', 'girlfriend', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'friends', 'say', '5', '10', 'job', 'TSA', 'Pittsburgh', 'airport', 'not', 'exactly', 'exciting', 'pretty', 'pathetic', 'women', 'hope', 'ex-girlfriend', 'will', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'moved', 'years', 'ago', 'guy', 'Kirk', 'not', 'exactly', 'prime', 'dating', 'material', 'However', 'when', 'lost', 'phone', 'attractive', 'woman', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'Molly', 'Kirk', 'unexpectedly', 'dating', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'luck', 'bad', 'advice', 'friends', 'question', 'motives.Baruchel', 'extremely', 'likeable', 'role', 'screenplay', 'surprisingly', 'sweet', 'times', 'Yes', 'are', 'raunchy', 'scenes', 'seemingly', 'prerequisite', 'current', 'comedies', 'focus', 'interplay', 'two', 'leads', 'differences', 'how', 'men', 'women', 'view', 'relationships', 'scenes', 'are', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'are', 'fall', 'flat', 'such', 'extended', 'bit', 'where', 'Molly', 'ex-boyfriend', 'assumes', 'Kirk', 'gay', 'My', 'League', 'above', 'average', 'comedy', 'very', 'good', 'casting', 'relatively', 'high', 'likeability', 'factor', 'hope', 'success', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'see', 'Baruchel', 'more', 'leading', 'parts']",N/A
