1119862,A3UE57S8G2G72Y,B000YGGNR4,A Customer,"[5, 5]","This is a great movie because it's about one of my heroes. It is a very interesting account of the obstacles that Senator Dallaire faced in Rwanda, and this character is nothing like the Nick Nolte character in Hotel Rwanda in the sense that he is very lovable, gentle, and human. He is my definition of a genuine hero because he showed true courage in the face of calamity. He did what a real man is supposed to do: stick around when the going gets tough. Unfortunately, his health was at stake. I love that he approves of this film. I know because I watched the special features of this film, and I watched him discuss this film with Roy Dupuis on Youtube. Hollywood doesn't always present a true account of historical events, but this is a great film to get. It's independent. I prefer this one to Hotel Rwanda. Roy Dupuis did a great job in portraying the senator. I rooted for him as will many viewers who care about the necessity of saving lives. The world needs more people like this amazing individual. This film is a must-have, and I highly recommend it to everyone.",5,An Eye-Opening Film,1305417600,"05 15, 2011",2011,1075,"['great', 'movie', 'one', 'heroes', 'very', 'interesting', 'account', 'obstacles', 'Senator', 'Dallaire', 'faced', 'Rwanda', 'character', 'nothing', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'character', 'Hotel', 'Rwanda', 'sense', 'very', 'lovable', 'gentle', 'human', 'definition', 'genuine', 'hero', 'showed', 'true', 'courage', 'face', 'calamity', 'did', 'what', 'real', 'man', 'supposed', 'do', 'stick', 'around', 'when', 'going', 'tough', 'Unfortunately', 'health', 'was', 'stake', 'love', 'film', 'know', 'watched', 'special', 'features', 'film', 'watched', 'discuss', 'film', 'Roy', 'Dupuis', 'Youtube', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'always', 'present', 'true', 'account', 'historical', 'events', 'great', 'film', 'get', 'independent', 'prefer', 'one', 'Hotel', 'Rwanda', 'Roy', 'Dupuis', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'senator', 'rooted', 'as', 'will', 'many', 'viewers', 'who', 'care', 'necessity', 'saving', 'lives', 'world', 'more', 'people', 'amazing', 'individual', 'film', 'must-have', 'highly', 'recommend', 'everyone']",N/A

It really gives you an idea of what went on and how badly the rest of the world and the United Nations responded to this disaster.  The performances are great throughout the film and the story it weaves about the commanding general of the UN forces and his efforts is a very powerful piece of film making.

The primary reason for my 5 star rating is the performance of Roy Dupuis as General Romeo Dallaire the man in charge of the UN mission to keep peace in the country. Dupuis (Le Femme Nikita), just inherits this role and displays all the insanity, confusion, and stupidity of the UN while trying to be a 'peacekeeper' in a country where that is just impossible. This is not a 'shoot em up' film but it is very, very violent and hard to watch.

It is a true statement of the disgraceful responses from UN politicians and the bravery of a Canadian soldier in command whom despite all odds and all advice did what he knew was best for humanity. He did have followers so we need to credit them as well - but the world could have prevented a slaughter of almost a million people and decided to pull troops out in a time of need.How can such illleadership take place then and now? This is not a Hollywood flick for entertainment - but what should be seen as an ignorant and embarrassing slip from modern society. Totally preventable and most around the globe unaware.We owe it to the future to become more aware of such events, and we should question what we are seeing. If you doubt this we should research it. If we find that there are lies and discrepancies with what we see we should report it (in reviews like this) but when you read on and find truth - we should tell what we see as a critical lesson for the world to be aware of.",5,an ignorant and embarrassing slip from modern society,1293753600,"12 31, 2010",2010,1285,"['not', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'reflected', 'upon.I', 'think', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'topic', 'new', 'event', 'Rwanda', 'are', 'interested', 'human', 'rights', 'issues', 'great', 'docudrama', 'events', 'recently', 'occurred', 'true', 'statement', 'disgraceful', 'responses', 'UN', 'politicians', 'bravery', 'Canadian', 'soldier', 'command', 'whom', 'odds', 'advice', 'did', 'what', 'knew', 'was', 'best', 'humanity', 'did', 'have', 'followers', 'need', 'credit', 'well', 'world', 'could', 'have', 'prevented', 'slaughter', 'almost', 'million', 'people', 'decided', 'pull', 'troops', 'out', 'time', 'need.How', 'can', 'such', 'illleadership', 'take', 'place', 'then', 'now', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'flick', 'entertainment', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'ignorant', 'embarrassing', 'slip', 'modern', 'society', 'Totally', 'preventable', 'most', 'globe', 'unaware.We', 'owe', 'future', 'become', 'more', 'aware', 'such', 'events', 'should', 'question', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'doubt', 'should', 'research', 'find', 'are', 'lies', 'discrepancies', 'what', 'see', 'should', 'report', 'reviews', 'when', 'read', 'find', 'truth', 'should', 'tell', 'what', 'see', 'critical', 'lesson', 'world', 'be', 'aware']",N/A

In fact the ones that were on the ground were short on ammunition and barely able to defend themselves - which at times they could not even do that.France does not come across well - more interested in their slice of the pie than protecting innocent people.Even after all his efforts - the Canadian and Dutch commanders ended up being punished by their own governments unjustly for what occured in Rwanda.
