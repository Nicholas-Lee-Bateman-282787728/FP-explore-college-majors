792000,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B00013D53A,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""","[2, 3]","First off, this is an adorable series. I picked it up because of my Alan Davies fixation. (What can I say, I love Jonathan Cross?) The only thing I need to warn potential viewers is that this isn't the comedy that many people claim it is. It's a dramedy with more emphasis on the drama than then comedy.Bob is a gay man. Rose is a straight woman. They meet purely by accident & fall in love. Falling in love was the easy part as there's more obstacles in store for these two- including a meddling best friend & a man who may be into Rose's mom for less than great reasons. Based on the true story of one of writer Robert T Davies' friends, it's an interesting story for most audiences.I really did like this series. It's a cute story & if not for the whole ""true story"" bit, the story would be a little far fetched for me. The actors all do a really wonderful job & it's nice to see a few familiar faces such as Jessica Stevenson from 'Spaced'. The plot is great, but I have to admit that this isn't something that I could watch over & over again. I'd rewatch it, but not constantly so. It's a decent tale & many will enjoy it.I'd just recommend this as more of a rental than a purchase, at least at first. This is the kind of series that people will either like or hate, with very few inbetween.",3,"Cute, but not something I'd watch over & over again.",1260057600,"12 6, 2009",2009,1296,"['First', 'off', 'adorable', 'series', 'picked', 'up', 'Alan', 'Davies', 'fixation', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'love', 'Jonathan', 'Cross', 'only', 'thing', 'need', 'warn', 'potential', 'viewers', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'many', 'people', 'claim', 'dramedy', 'more', 'emphasis', 'drama', 'then', 'comedy.Bob', 'gay', 'man', 'Rose', 'straight', 'woman', 'meet', 'purely', 'accident', 'fall', 'love', 'Falling', 'love', 'was', 'easy', 'part', 'more', 'obstacles', 'store', 'two-', 'including', 'meddling', 'best', 'friend', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'Rose', 'mom', 'less', 'great', 'reasons', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'one', 'writer', 'Robert', 'T', 'Davies', 'friends', 'interesting', 'story', 'most', 'audiences.I', 'really', 'did', 'series', 'cute', 'story', 'not', 'whole', 'true', 'story', 'bit', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'far', 'fetched', 'actors', 'do', 'really', 'wonderful', 'job', 'nice', 'see', 'few', 'familiar', 'such', 'Jessica', 'Stevenson', ""'Spaced"", 'plot', 'great', 'have', 'admit', ""n't"", 'something', 'could', 'watch', 'over', 'over', 'again', ""'d"", 'rewatch', 'not', 'constantly', 'so', 'decent', 'tale', 'many', 'will', 'enjoy', 'it.I', ""'d"", 'just', 'recommend', 'more', 'rental', 'purchase', 'least', 'first', 'kind', 'series', 'people', 'will', 'either', 'hate', 'very', 'few', 'inbetween']",Bob & Rose - The Complete Series

In a way, I guess this Brit romcom is a straight woman's dream. As my gay male friend said, ""If you're gay, you're gay."" But it was based on a true story and one line from the film gets to the heart of the story: Anyone can fall in love with anyone.It did address many stereotypes from the hetero and gay side, as well as from family and friends of both. I think it was well-written, well acted (Davies and Sharp were perfect in the roles and very believable)and quite humorous at just the right times. It certainly provoked hours of deep discussion between myself and my gay friends on many levels and that alone was worth it.

792005,A334DYKDLA9K8L,B00013D53A,"M. G. Mora ""Bad Wolf""","[4, 8]","I watched this recently on the Logo channel and was intrigued for two reasons. First the subject matter and second because it was written by Russell T.Davies who was responsible for reviving Doctor Who this year which I loved.Was this show successful? Pretty much. The chemistry between the two leads was good and I liked the writing. I also enjoyed the parents of Bob and Rose yet you really never are given definite answers what happens to them in the end. I'm glad it was only a limited series because I dont think it would have held up over a year or two. The problems I had with it were the character that was trying to break Bob and Rose up (I don't remember her name). She was a stock bad guy who you didn't feel any empathy for at all so when she redeems herself at the end, you wonder, why does everyone forgive her just like that. Why didn't she get what she deserves?The second problem I had with it was Bob, though not really changing his sexuality, but giving it up for a Woman. How fair is that to either party? I've read there was a lot of controversey about this when it first aired from gay men who belived that this was portraying Homosexuality as something that could be cured.It can not.In the end, I dont see that it explored that particular subject as well as it could but was enteretained never the less.",4,Interesting character study,1134691200,"12 16, 2005",2005,1327,"['watched', 'recently', 'Logo', 'channel', 'was', 'intrigued', 'two', 'reasons', 'First', 'subject', 'matter', 'second', 'was', 'written', 'Russell', 'T.Davies', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'reviving', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'year', 'loved.Was', 'show', 'successful', 'Pretty', 'much', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'was', 'good', 'liked', 'writing', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'parents', 'Bob', 'Rose', 'yet', 'really', 'never', 'are', 'given', 'definite', 'answers', 'what', 'end', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', 'only', 'limited', 'series', 'dont', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'held', 'up', 'year', 'two', 'problems', 'had', 'were', 'character', 'was', 'trying', 'break', 'Bob', 'Rose', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'name', 'was', 'stock', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'empathy', 'so', 'when', 'end', 'wonder', 'why', 'everyone', 'forgive', 'just', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'second', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'Bob', 'not', 'really', 'changing', 'sexuality', 'giving', 'up', 'Woman', 'How', 'fair', 'party', ""'ve"", 'read', 'was', 'lot', 'controversey', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'gay', 'men', 'who', 'belived', 'was', 'portraying', 'Homosexuality', 'something', 'could', 'be', 'cured.It', 'can', 'not.In', 'end', 'dont', 'see', 'explored', 'particular', 'subject', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'was', 'enteretained', 'never', 'less']",Bob & Rose - The Complete Series

792007,A25S4Q7KSTEW02,B00013D53A,W. Rodick,"[4, 4]","I shouldn't really write this review. Bob and Rose is so close to me. A woman who fancies the socks off a man. They enjoy each other's chat. Without affectation. She searches to make contact with him. He is natural. She knows there is something. Something she had not thought possible. Warmth. She is slightly older. He is gay. Barriers are broken down. Friendship is the basis of everything. It's what I fantasise about. Even in my dreams. I shouldn't really write this review.As well as the immaculate acting I noticed the director's name. Julian Farino directed episode four of Rome Season 1. Watching Bob and Rose the pace of the narrative is perfect. Shot by shot, close-up by close-up. Music like a character in the story. The casting is as natural as the landscapes of Manchester woven into the delicious script. A script that takes me inside of me. Not the gay stuff but the unity of Bob and Rose's unfolding relationship. My last review (on Amazon UK) was for House Season 7 which could easily be subtitled 'An Anatomy of a Relationship.' Piece by piece, but somehow against the wind Greg House and Lisa Cuddy try to get together. Russell T. Davies has written something far above their professional ills. Something natural in a mixed-up world where relationships are little more than convenient alliances. Something to talk about. Or worse.It's a celebration of human diversity. Greed is embodied in the character of Rose's mum's new man; the James Bond loving Gadd. Sickly and eventually found-out. The happy ending is in-keeping with this drama's dive into the reality of living and not just working. Characters blossom. And bloom. And I wish for a Rose in my life. And not just loony tunes.Ten years since its making I've watched the double vhs tape many times. The dvd has subtitles to catch the odd word lost in a disco crowd. I never did catch what Rose said: 'I'm just a passing whore' I thought, but is: 'I'm just a passing hole' as they turn away in disgust. Mockery was never so well honed as here. It's the kind of script that banishes all fantasies of writing for television or film, that this reviewer sometimes entertains, into the oblivion of oblivion. Heaven is what we create between us.
