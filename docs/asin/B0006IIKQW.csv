If that doesn't move you, and all you could focus on were the logic gaps, I feel bad for you. And for those who claim the plot is dumb, the successful ""Flight Plan"" owes much to this movie.

868345,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B0006IIKQW,,"[3, 3]","I was afraid that ""The Forgotten"" was going to be just like all the other crappy thriller/horror movies that have been released over the past few years, but this film was pretty interesting and the ending was not at all craptastic.Basically, the movie opens by introducing Telly (Julianne Moore) as a grieving mother whose nine-year-old son supposedly died in a plane crash 14 months ago. In a very ""X-Files"" sort of way, Telly is stunned when her husband Jim (Anthony Edwards) suddenly tried to convince her that their son never existed. Everyone is under the impression that Telly is delusional...no one else in town has any memory of her child. Telly finally meets up with her neighbor, Ash (Dominic West), whose daughter was also aboard the plane that crashed. At first Ash has no memory of the children and is convinced that Telly is crazy, but she finally helps him trigger memories of his daughter. The two parents embark on a desperate and dangerous search in order to determine the truth behind what happened to their children and ultimately discover who (actually, more like WHAT) is behind the mystery.I think it would have been interesting to include a better explanation of why the ""experiment"" occurred in the first place. (I'd go into more detail, but I really don't want to spoil the plot for anyone!) I also would have appreciated having a better understanding of what Gary Sinese's character was up to at the end of the film and what the hell happened to Jim (is he still wandering around dazed and confused somewhere?). The movie doesn't go into great detail about HOW all these crazy things are happening and what exactly the ""creepy people"" (including Linus Roache's character) are supposed to be. That didn't bother me too much, but some people might not appreciate it. I was just happy that there were plenty of shocking moments in the film (I think I lost five years off my life when that car hit Telly's passenger door...that made me scream!) and that the ending was not stupid or predictable.""The Forgotten"" is not a great movie, but it's a pretty good one...definitely worth checking out.",4,Surprisingly good,1144281600,"04 6, 2006",2006,2115,"['was', 'afraid', 'Forgotten', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'just', 'other', 'crappy', 'thriller/horror', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'craptastic.Basically', 'movie', 'introducing', 'Telly', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'grieving', 'mother', 'nine-year-old', 'son', 'supposedly', 'died', 'plane', 'crash', '14', 'months', 'ago', 'very', 'X-Files', 'sort', 'way', 'Telly', 'stunned', 'when', 'husband', 'Jim', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'suddenly', 'tried', 'convince', 'son', 'never', 'existed', 'Everyone', 'impression', 'Telly', 'delusional', 'one', 'else', 'town', 'memory', 'child', 'Telly', 'finally', 'up', 'neighbor', 'Ash', 'Dominic', 'West', 'daughter', 'was', 'also', 'plane', 'crashed', 'first', 'Ash', 'memory', 'children', 'convinced', 'Telly', 'crazy', 'finally', 'trigger', 'memories', 'daughter', 'two', 'parents', 'embark', 'desperate', 'dangerous', 'search', 'order', 'determine', 'truth', 'what', 'happened', 'children', 'ultimately', 'discover', 'who', 'actually', 'more', 'WHAT', 'mystery.I', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'include', 'better', 'explanation', 'why', 'experiment', 'occurred', 'first', 'place', ""'d"", 'go', 'more', 'detail', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'plot', 'anyone', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'having', 'better', 'understanding', 'what', 'Gary', 'Sinese', 'character', 'was', 'up', 'end', 'film', 'what', 'hell', 'happened', 'Jim', 'still', 'wandering', 'dazed', 'confused', 'somewhere', 'movie', ""n't"", 'go', 'great', 'detail', 'HOW', 'crazy', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'what', 'exactly', 'creepy', 'people', 'including', 'Linus', 'Roache', 'character', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'too', 'much', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'appreciate', 'was', 'just', 'happy', 'were', 'plenty', 'shocking', 'moments', 'film', 'think', 'lost', 'five', 'years', 'life', 'when', 'car', 'hit', 'Telly', 'passenger', 'door', 'made', 'scream', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'stupid', 'predictable', 'Forgotten', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'definitely', 'checking', 'out']",N/A

This film falls in the classification of constructions of seditious conspiracy for its misrepresentaiton of the National Security Agency, schmoozing a liaison with an outer world, alien menace it only capitulates to, leaving the nation undefended.  Also, this form of grey propaganda elicits a compromising passivity in the public to be uncritical and to not hold their government accountable.There are overtones of White, that is Anglo spiritual superiority, but perhaps that is just coincidental--even though the script inflates it at the end, when Julie Moor becomes the 'fairest of them all' spiritual surrogate the rapacious alien cannot compromise.Viscera of mass media's saturation tend to go there, that is obstetrics, as The History Channel did recently when they spotlighted the Manson murders--taking no time to consider the backgrounds of the victims.

868349,AAYW1H4SMNOI,B0006IIKQW,"AFP ""AFP""","[7, 9]","When I first saw the trailer for this, I thought it was not only a horror movie, but I thought it was a rip off or a sequel to The Ring, as the trailer deceived many into thinkin. Nevertheless, as the movie started I was really into it, the atmosphere of the movie was a job well done, and the soundtrack was definately eerie/sad and it fit perfectly with the film. It's about a woman who's son died in a plane crash, among other victims, but she can't let go of her son's memories. The only problem is her son never existed, she see's a shrink about the problem, and denies everything people are saying is true. Her goal is to uncover thr truth and prove to everyone that her son did in fact exist and it isn't all in her mind. It's hard to go on without ruining the plot so I won't, I will say this much, it's definately a must see. It's a supernatural thriller more than it is a horror film. This movie get's one to think, what if this could be possible in the world we live in today, what if this is happening somewhere or could be happening. Call me crazy, but people who are into conspiracies will find a liking to this film. It definately has a sad mood overall, and I would have given this a 5 out of 5, but the ending didn't do the film justice. It was a happy/sad sort of ending but at the same time the film lacks explanation and leaves the viewer unsatisfied with what they don't know. I would still advise moviegoers to see this film because it's still better than alot of the stuff out there, and though it may seem cliche' at first there's more than meets the eye. If you're a fan of M. Night Shamalayan films, and movies that get you thinking about life and the world around you, this is the movie for you. Overall I did like the film, I just can't get over the fact that they left out so much. Just don't over analyse this movie, just take it for what it is. Let me also add that the acting was really good and it's definately a movie that will leave you curious until the end itself.",4,This movie had enormous potential....,1095984000,"09 24, 2004",2004,2001,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'thought', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'horror', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'rip', 'off', 'sequel', 'Ring', 'trailer', 'deceived', 'many', 'thinkin', 'Nevertheless', 'movie', 'started', 'was', 'really', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'was', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'definately', 'eerie/sad', 'perfectly', 'film', 'woman', 'who', 'son', 'died', 'plane', 'crash', 'other', 'victims', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'son', 'memories', 'only', 'problem', 'son', 'never', 'existed', 'see', 'shrink', 'problem', 'everything', 'people', 'are', 'saying', 'true', 'goal', 'uncover', 'thr', 'truth', 'prove', 'everyone', 'son', 'did', 'fact', 'exist', ""n't"", 'all', 'mind', 'hard', 'go', 'ruining', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'will', 'say', 'much', 'definately', 'must', 'see', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'more', 'horror', 'film', 'movie', 'get', 'one', 'think', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'possible', 'world', 'live', 'today', 'what', 'happening', 'somewhere', 'could', 'be', 'happening', 'Call', 'crazy', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'conspiracies', 'will', 'find', 'liking', 'film', 'definately', 'sad', 'mood', 'overall', 'would', 'have', 'given', '5', '5', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'film', 'justice', 'was', 'happy/sad', 'sort', 'ending', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'explanation', 'viewer', 'unsatisfied', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'still', 'advise', 'moviegoers', 'see', 'film', 'still', 'better', 'alot', 'stuff', 'there', 'may', 'seem', 'cliche', 'first', 'more', 'eye', ""'re"", 'fan', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shamalayan', 'films', 'movies', 'get', 'thinking', 'life', 'world', 'movie', 'Overall', 'did', 'film', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'fact', 'left', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'over', 'analyse', 'movie', 'just', 'take', 'what', 'Let', 'also', 'add', 'acting', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'definately', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'curious', 'end']",N/A
868350,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0006IIKQW,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 4]","I think everyone will agree that if this was an X-Files episode FOX would have proceeded it with the announcement that ""all of our questions would be answered"".  Then, upon watching this episode, we would realize that not all of our questions were answered, but instead left on the table to allow us to figure out ourselves or not at all.  That was a huge downfall for The Forgotten that really irritated me throughout the picture.  Here we had the gorgeous concept of abduction, a mother's ability never to forget the child she lost, and this enormous possibility of government conspiracies, but it literally went nowhere.  Throughout the film new concepts, new ideas, and possibilities that seem endless constantly attack us, but we are given no explanation.  That is what bothered me the most.  We had the framework for a very decent little sci-fi thriller, but instead director Joseph Ruben decided to go with a familiar story that would appeal to a non-intelligent audience instead of a crisp thriller that could have really bent your mind.  I wanted my mind to wrap around this film, but instead I think my mind fell asleep.Julianne Moore did a decent job in this film, but perhaps gave a bit too much emotion behind her character.  If she wasn't crying than she was screaming or running.  I wanted to see the strength of this woman and her perseverance to find her missing child, not this emotional nutcase that has a reaction to everything that happens to her.  I know that Moore can do a very emotionally heavy film, but I didn't think that this project needed her to be at such a top level.  Perhaps that is what was wrong with this film.  The focus was completely off.  Here we are focusing on the emotional struggle that Moore is going through, when we really should be trying to uncover the truth behind the disappearance.  There was nearly no attempt to find out the truth.  For some strange reason, I remember feeling like the honest truth was difficult for our actors to say.  I felt as if they were forced into this side event that would stop Moore from being so emotional.  Or, perhaps, nobody really knew what the truth was.  Here we had this huge surprise Shyamalan-esque styled ending, but I never really felt as if the actors were on the same page.  I could hear Ruben gasping from excitement in the background, but Sinise, West, and even Woodard seemed less surprised by it all.I think that this film didn't do as well as hoped because the lines between what type of genre this was were skewed.  Was it a sci-fi?  People flying up into the air just doesn't quite do it enough for me (kinda felt like a cheap way of explaining things).  Was Moore really just imagining all of this?  Yet another question that needed a definite answer by the end because there were so many other elements happening that a direct answer would have only strengthened the entire film.  Did anyone really care why the child was abducted?  It seemed a bit flimsy to me, but again, I am no mother.  I needed something, perhaps others did not, but there were these huge gaping plot holes in the film that needed to be filled somehow, but apparently the repairman couldn't make it to the set.  We just jumped from moment to moment without any further explanation or reasoning.  I cannot express this enough.  That is the ultimate downfall for this film, the utter lack of coherence and connection between everything.  I felt like I was watching a connect-the-dots that followed no order and the performers just went where ever they wanted instead of going from point A to point B.I think I have gone a bit sidetracked here, but when I think of this film, I just cannot put everything together.  I don't need something handed to me on a silver platter, in fact, I love movies that make me ponder the truth.  The sad part about The Forgotten is that I nearly forgot why I was watching it midway through the film.  I was connected to nothing and the unanswered questions that only broadened the scope of the film into this massive ordeal that nobody, from the director to the actors could handle.I would also like to comment on the DVD itself of this film.  For me, the theatrical version was much better than the extended version.  I have heard others say that they would prefer to watch the extended because it gives us a better answer to the end (and I won't get into unanswered questions again), but for me the original ending was a hair better.  Perhaps it is because I watched the extended first and it gave me such a sour taste in my mouth that the original might have just helped dissipate that sour sensation.  Either way, that is my two cents.Overall, I thought this was nothing more than just your standard issue sci-fi thriller that could have been pushed into the category of interesting or creative if it wasn't so clich&eacute;d ridden with this overwhelming desire to be ""secretive"".  The secret is given away by the middle of the film, which still doesn't answer the questions that we have.  Ruben was working with too big of a concept for his britches with this project and you can tell by the finished product that more could have been done to capture the sensationalism of aliens and abduction.  It has been done before in other films, why couldn't he do it here?  Yet another question that will never be answered as this film becomes just another cinematic mediocrity.Grade: *** out of *****",3,"Psychotic women and the men, who love them.",1111622400,"03 24,

868352,AFXTPJOE2D4M3,B0006IIKQW,Algernon D'Ammassa,"[0, 2]","Talk about handing ammunition to mean-spirited movie critics.  One of the most startling images in this supernatural thriller is the sight of characters being, literally, sucked into space and out of sight.  No shaft of light or ""Star Trek"" transporter beam: just gone, as if in a huge vacuum cleaner, tempting us to all kinds of jokes about what in this movie 'really sucks.'But the answer is, not much.  The film has appealing performances by Julianne Moore, Gary Sinise, Dominic West, and Alfre Woodard.

These heathens believe that the rational beings on earth are alone, unique among the galaxies, masters of all.  But The Forgotten begs to differ.  Indeed, individuals unwilling to concede that malevolent forces interfere in the lives of mankind and treat human beings with the same dispassionate cruelty scientists reserve for lab rats would have a hard time explaining the W. Bush administration.  But then, so would the W. Bush administration, should it ever feel the need to do so.Critics and audiences alike seem to have held The Forgotten up to a rather high standard and consequently missed the boat.  Undoubtedly this was due to the presence of Julianne Moore, a marquee actress.  They astutely pointed out the lack of concrete proof that space aliens control our lives!  They also pointed out that being the editor of children's books doesn't exactly qualify you to outmaneuver Federal Agents!  Zut alors!  Imagine this, improbability in a film!  However, they failed to light on the nice idea that memories themselves play a large role in shaping who and what we are - and stealing them away not only will drive us mad - it will make us malleable and easy to exploit.  This interesting notion is elegantly wrapped in a dressy psychological thriller that features good acting, cracker-jack special effects, and excellent pacing.Yes it is implausible that space aliens are using human beings as part of a science project to be presented at an inter-galactic parent's night.  But let's just say that the sci-fi angle is in there for purposes of plot convenience, and the ""aliens"" in question are the top 1% who very conveniently sit on the same boards of the same companies and shuffle quietly in between government posts and lucrative private sector appointments with an uncanny knack for attracting government contracts.

868356,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0006IIKQW,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Supposedly Julianne Moore is a good actress.  She has a strong fan base that glorifies her with godlike titles and stand behind her work one-hundred percent.  She may be a good actress, but I present to you exhibit A as proof that she is a dumb one.  I don't know what distresses me more about `The Forgotten', the fact that I expected more out of the plot or the fact that I expected more out of Moore herself.  I remember vividly when this film was released and being intrigued by the way the trailer emphasized the creepy atmosphere of the film, and atmosphere this is all but absent in the actual film.  I remember being excited by the premise, a premise with lots of potential that quickly evaporates in the climatic scenes and fails to live up to its potential.  I remember saying to myself, Julianne Moore is supposed to be a good actress, a great actress even so this has got to be good.  Like I said, good actress or not, this film is just one of many that prove she's pretty stupid.`The Forgotten' plays out like a C-Grade alien flick complete with fields of tall grass (you ever notice how they always tend to show up in alien films).  The story revolves around Telly Paretta, a young woman who has lost her son in a plane crash.  She's still in the thick of the grieving process and has to see a shrink to help deal with the pain.  She spends hours in her son's room looking through his things, feeling his baseball glove, staring at his photographs until one day they all disappear.  There is nothing in his drawers and his face has been removed from all the family photographs.  She thinks her husband is trying to force her to move on but he insists that she never had a son, that she had suffered a miscarriage and has been pretty much batty ever since.The remainder of the film consists of Telly and another grieving parent Ash trying to find their children they claim have been taken from them.  The feds are after them and so they must stay in hiding, and then there's this strange man who keeps showing up, a man they are just certain had something to do with their children's disappearance.  The film to me starts to fall apart the minute Telly's husband forgets who she is.  To me that was just too far because it really has nothing to do with the end result of the film.  This is about a world forgetting about a child and a mother being the only one to remember him.  Having her husband forget who she is was just out of place and unnecessary.  Maybe it was just a way to eliminate the need for his character anymore, but it was just stupid.  In fact, the character of Ash as well was a little to open ended.  He really has nothing to do with the final outcome.  This is a story about Telly and having another parent, especially a male, going through her turmoil was pointless.I think what really did it for me though was the way the film ends.  We're waiting for this explosive conclusion, something really earth shattering and in the end it's utterly disappointing.  It leaves the audience feeling ripped off, seriously ripped off.  The alternate ending provided on the DVD is even worse than the one used in the film.  I'll say this, to me this film works like a loose plot build around a cool special effect.  It's almost like some kid was sitting at his computer messing with some video feed and figured out a way to make people fling carelessly into the sky and said ""this would look awesome in a movie"" and so they found a way to use it.  And that's just it.  The scenes where people are being extracted into space is actually pretty cool, especially when the whole cabin room flings off, but aside from a cool special effect `The Forgotten' is a forgettable mess of C-Grade cinema.Sorry Moore, but in this case less, or none at all, would have been preferable.  Here's to hoping you smarten up because what I saw in `Far From Heaven' or even `Boogie Nights' is far removed from the poor excuse I see in this drivel.*I just want to say that I'm really struggling with a rating for this film.  I can see how some would find some satisfaction within but overall it is a messy and somewhat boring endeavor.  I'm going with 2 stars against my better judgment (my instinct says 1) based solely on the fact that those special effects are spectacularly used and Dominic West actually does some convincing acting no matter how unnecessary his character really was.*",2,Forgettable mess of C-Grade cinema...,1190073600,"09 18, 2007",2007,4388,"['Supposedly', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'good', 'actress', 'strong', 'fan', 'base', 'godlike', 'titles', 'stand', 'work', 'one-hundred', 'percent', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'actress', 'present', 'exhibit', 'proof', 'dumb', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'more', 'Forgotten', 'fact', 'expected', 'more', 'plot', 'fact', 'expected', 'more', 'Moore', 'remember', 'vividly', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'being', 'intrigued', 'way', 'trailer', 'emphasized', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'absent', 'actual', 'film', 'remember', 'being', 'excited', 'premise', 'premise', 'lots', 'potential', 'quickly', 'climatic', 'scenes', 'fails', 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'remember', 'saying', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'supposed', 'be', 'good', 'actress', 'great', 'actress', 'even', 'so', 'got', 'be', 'good', 'said', 'good', 'actress', 'not', 'film', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'prove', 'pretty', 'stupid.', 'Forgotten', 'plays', 'C-Grade', 'alien', 'flick', 'complete', 'fields', 'tall', 'grass', 'ever', 'notice', 'how', 'always', 'tend', 'show', 'up', 'alien', 'films', 'story', 'around', 'Telly', 'Paretta', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'lost', 'son', 'plane', 'crash', 'still', 'thick', 'grieving', 'process', 'see', 'shrink', 'help', 'deal', 'pain', 'hours', 'son', 'room', 'looking', 'things', 'feeling', 'baseball', 'glove', 'staring', 'photographs', 'one', 'day', 'disappear', 'nothing', 'drawers', 'face', 'been', 'removed', 'family', 'photographs', 'husband', 'trying', 'force', 'move', 'never', 'had', 'son', 'had', 'suffered', 'miscarriage', 'been', 'pretty', 'much', 'ever', 'since.The', 'remainder', 'film', 'Telly', 'grieving', 'parent', 'Ash', 'trying', 'find', 'children', 'claim', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'feds', 'are', 'so', 'must', 'stay', 'hiding', 'then', 'strange', 'man', 'who', 'showing', 'up', 'man', 'are', 'just', 'certain', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'children', 'disappearance', 'film', 'fall', 'apart', 'minute', 'Telly', 'husband', 'forgets', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'far', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'end', 'result', 'film', 'world', 'forgetting', 'child', 'mother', 'being', 'only', 'one', 'remember', 'Having', 'husband', 'forget', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'place', 'unnecessary', 'Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'eliminate', 'need', 'character', 'anymore', 'was', 'just', 'stupid', 'fact', 'character', 'Ash', 'well', 'was', 'little', 'open', 'ended', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'final', 'outcome', 'story', 'Telly', 'having', 'parent', 'especially', 'male', 'going', 'turmoil', 'was', 'pointless.I', 'think', 'what', 'really', 'did', 'was', 'way', 'film', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'explosive', 'conclusion', 'something', 'really', 'earth', 'shattering', 'end', 'utterly', 'disappointing', 'audience', 'feeling', 'ripped', 'off', 'seriously', 'ripped', 'off', 'alternate', 'ending', 'provided', 'DVD', 'even', 'worse', 'one', 'used', 'film', ""'ll"", 'say', 'film', 'loose', 'plot', 'build', 'cool', 'special', 'effect', 'almost', 'kid', 'was', 'sitting', 'computer', 'messing', 'video', 'feed', 'figured', 'out', 'way', 'make', 'people', 'fling', 'carelessly', 'sky', 'said', 'would', 'look', 'awesome', 'movie', 'so', 'found', 'way', 'use', 'just', 'scenes', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'extracted', 'space', 'actually', 'pretty', 'cool', 'especially', 'when', 'whole', 'cabin', 'room', 'flings', 'aside', 'cool', 'special', 'effect', 'Forgotten', 'forgettable', 'mess', 'C-Grade', 'cinema.Sorry', 'Moore', 'case', 'less', 'none', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'preferable', 'Here', 'hoping', 'smarten', 'up', 'what', 'saw', 'Far', 'Heaven', 'even', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'far', 'removed', 'poor', 'excuse', 'see', 'drivel', '*I', 'just', 'want', 'say', ""'m"", 'really', 'struggling', 'rating', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'find', 'satisfaction', 'overall', 'messy', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'endeavor', ""'m"", 'going', '2', 'stars', 'better', 'judgment', 'instinct', '1', 'based', 'solely', 'fact', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'spectacularly', 'used', 'Dominic', 'West', 'actually', 'convincing', 'acting', 'matter', 'how', 'unnecessary', 'character', 'really', 'was', '*']",N/A

STOP, BEFORE YOU WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!Excellent actors like Julianne Moore, Alfre Woodard, Gary Sinise and Anthony Edwards (and less famous, sexy Dominic West) are completely wasted in this piece of poorly written drivel.  Long, boring scenes of Moore and West fleeing federal agents through garbage-strewn back alleys are meant to take the place of suspense.  Flashbacks lose their potency as we see them repeated over and over.  A series of nonsensical plot points frustrates the narrative:  why and how is Gary Sinise's character ""in on"" the conspiracy?  Why do federal agents chase Moore and West with such fervor at some times, and at other times, allow them to roam around freely, when it's obvious they know their every move?  If Moore and West are out of cash but can't use their bank or credit cards, how do they continue to eat, stay in hotels and pay for gas?At the end, my incredulous reaction was:  ""That's it?  That's the whole thing?  We're done?""As others have noted here, this film is an example of a good, intriguing idea gone bad, or rather, gone to seed due to a lack of imagination on the part of the writers.  Notably awful is the abuse of Alfre Woodard, a great actress who has never really gotten her due, in a caricature of the independent-minded cop at odds with the system.  But by far the worst sin is the waste of the great sensitivity and skill of Julianne Moore.  I guess every good actor needs to pay the bills, and will sometimes take a role just to work.

Ryan ""Merribelle""","[5, 8]","I hate to sound like a PTA lady or something, but you just cannot know certain emotions until you have experienced your own children.  Lest you scoff, I used to roll my eyes when people would wax sentimental about their kids.  But this really is a different ball game my friends, and until you have felt that peculiar pull in your chest as the chubby hand of your toddler grips your index finger to cross the street, you just won't get it.  For that same reason, (I believe) the movie The Forgotten won't be experienced the same way by childless people as it will by parents.The following is all information that was previously given away in the theatrical trailers:  Telly (Julianne Moore) has been grieving for her son Sam for 14 months now, following his death in a plane crash.  Imagine how she is simply unable to accept her therapist's sudden diagnosis one day that Sam was a figment of her imagination; in fact, her husband, friends, everybody in her life sincerely claims he never existed.  There are no pictures, no records of his birth, his life, or the crash. You will begin to wonder along with Telly if she isn't crazy, that is until she meets another parent of a child in that same crash whom she convinces to remember his daughter, using undeniable physical proof.  Obviously two strangers don't normally share in the same elaborate delusion, so some kind of conspiracy must be going on...but why, and how is it  *humanly* possible?Julianne Moore, who only gets more attractive with time, was the flawless choice for the lead in this film.  She so convincingly portrays a grieving mom who just can't let go that my throat was tight with sympathy throughout half the film.  Played by unknown Dominic West, the only other parent she locates is an alcoholic who is punishing himself for forgetting the most precious person in his life.  One of my favorite (and underutilized) actors, Gary Sinise, was a natural for Telly's therapist, although his role was somewhat minimized.  I have noticed that very few critics have been able to fault any of the leads in The Forgotten despite what other misgivings they may have.And what misgivings are we talking about exactly?  More or less, they were disappointed that there was a Sci Fi explanation for the events of Sam's disappearance.  It would seem that naysayers would have preferred find out that the whole thing was a delusion or a mundane government conspiracy. Given the info that we all got from the trailer (see above), those really weren't logical options, now were they?  You may now picture me shaking my head sadly as I confront the critical ones with a Tsk Tsk, and ""Weren't you paying attention?""The secondary strength of The Forgotten was its themes.  Explored here are the strength of the parent/child bond, questions on the relativity of reality, and the place of humankind in the greater scheme of things.  Not easy material to cram into less than two hours, but handled nicely in this story.  Applause also goes out to the art direction and sound editing.  The depth of emotional response was underscored deftly by DTS.  This is one to see with the full advantage of a loaded sound system.  Without giving too much away, trust me:  you will appreciate those moments of pure physical thrill that a good sound format can highlight so effectively.Perhaps this film would not have affected me so viscerally if I had not been a parent.  Perhaps therefore non-parents cannot be blamed for getting less out of it, as much of its effectiveness relies on empathy with Telly and Ash.  Still, there are many other worthwhile reasons to see The Forgotten, and I humbly hope that I have just explained why.

868360,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,B0006IIKQW,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[1, 1]","Certain moments made me gasp or hold my breath. Others left me going, ""That's it?"" I'm sure that other people, who have seen the trailer and heard the hype, may be left thinking just that-- This is it? That's all? Come on, give me a little bit more! Despite it's shortcomings, The Forgotten is a passable thriller that will at least keep you guessing, even if you don't feel like guessing any more.Julianne Moore is Telly. She's grieving for the death of her 9 year old son, killed in a plane crash. She's seeing a therapist (Gary Sinise) who tries to help her cope and her husband (Anthony Edwards) is understanding. Everyday she goes to her son's dresser and looks at photos and holds his baseball glove. One day at the dresser, the photos are gone. It's like her son has been erased. Her therapist tells her that she never had a son; she miscarried and imagined a life with a son. She doesn't buy this theory at all, confident that there is a conspiracy. Ash (Dominic West) is also a grieving parent (his daughter died in the same plane crash). But suddenly one day, he doesn't remember his own daughter, until Telly rips the wallpaper off in one room, revealing that it was in fact his daughter's room. The two spend the rest of the film together, running from people who keep chasing them for reasons we don't know and trying to figure out what the heck happened to their children and their own memories.It is a bit clunky. The overall premise is exciting. What would you do if one day someone told you that you never had a child? Or husband? Or wife? But the payoff in the end is, I feel, a cop-out. Short of giving the end away, I'll just say that it's very X-Files-ish. So if you like that show, you'll probably like this movie. It does bend your mind and about 60 minutes in, you'll be rubbing your head wondering what in the world is going on. Julianne Moore and Dominic West are great together, stopping to be sad just when they've stopped being chased.Check this out sometime, it's an interesting ride.

Unfortunately, I have to agree with the critics: ""The Forgotten"" is a film best forgotten. It comes across as a second-rate ""X Files"" rip off.The main character, Telly Paretta, has lost her son Sam in a plane crash. About a year later, all memories of Sam mysteriously vanishes, Telly's doctor tells her that she is delusional, and neither her husband nor her babysitter remembers anything. However, Telly finds one person who does remember: a former NHL player turned heavy drinker named Ash whose daughter was on the same plane. Together, they try to find out the truth about the missing children. Soon, both Telly and Ash are hunted by the National Security Agency. Before long, they realize that the federal government have struck a deal with a group of space aliens who abduct children to conduct weird experiments.It would have worked in the hands of Chris Carter. In this production, the idea never really takes off. ""The Forgotten"" isn't even scary, and only the first part is psychologically interesting. The alien is very bland, and the only worked out characters are Telly and Ash. The end of the movie is ridiculous. I got the impression that the scriptwriter didn't really know how to end the movie, and invented a ""Pamela and Bobby Ewing"" kind of twist, just to end it all!It's a real pity that ""The Forgotten"" wasn't better, especially since so many good actors participated in this project. In the end, it didn't satisfy anyone.

868368,A29QM4M1KVTWVF,B0006IIKQW,Bitter Bunny,"[5, 5]","This movie had the potential for more than it actually materialized into. Like a few reviewers, I had a problem with the ""mystery"" behind the existence of the main character's son. It's hard to explain without giving away some of the plot elements so be forewarned that from this point on, there may be a few spoilers!I would've been much happier with a supernatural twist on the idea of a child that was believed to exist, but that's just me I suppose. The real problem I had with the alien abduction plot was not so much the concept, but the execution. It actually reminds me of the premise of the movie ""Dark City"" by Alex Proyas, which is a much better alien abductee movie, by the way. Certain mechanics of how the alien race accomplishes its experiments are revealed making it for a more ""believable"" experience.In Forgotten, there's a line in the movie where a character compares our hero Telly(Julianne Moore) to a lab rat. As you probably know, lab rats are often placed in an unusual environment and given free mobility for study purposes and/or injected with tomorrow's cures for today's deadly diseases and examined. Julianne Moore plays the former rat minus the fact that she isn't placed in a controlled environment per se. Rather, everything that happens to her takes place in the real world as the experimenting ""alien doctors"" have certain abilities of brainwashing individuals at will. Along with this, they posess the uncanny ability of marrying/unmarrying people and completely erasing individuals from everyone's memory. I guess a paper trail is no problem for these guys being that they're in cahoots with the feds.In Dark City, there exists such a controlled environment that allows the alien race to study humans as they interact in the environment. Not only does this work to develop the storyline, but it solves a few ""problems"" about paperwork, the government, etc. I'm not saying Forgotten should have gone that route as well, but it should have done a better job ironing out the details.It's important to note that I am only comparing these movies as far as the plot element goes. The style and genre of each is clearly marked in that ""Dark City"" is more sci-fi oriented and ""Forgotten"" is more psychological-driven.Ok, so fine, they want to measure the strength of the mother/child bond....but um, why? Are they having trouble with runaway teenagers on their home planet?This movie compromises the soundness of its ending by making it a happy one. No matter how hard they try, Telly still holds on to the memory of her son and that brings an end to the experiment. Her son is returned and she begins to put the pieces of her life again. I expected to see her being disected on a table at the end, if you want to travel the Twilight Zone route. Or, having studied the relationship via the parent's perspective, perhaps the alien doctors should have turned the table and studied the son instead, if you want to pull a Hitchcock. The rationale for the latter is that only data from the mother in the mother/child relationship has been gathered making it incomplete.There is a nice statement Gary Sinise's character makes about the fact that the humans having no options as to our role in experimentation at the hands of superior beings. Do these creatures know not of love? Is that an anomally in humans? Were we to evolve, as a human race, would we lose the ability to love/hate?The bottom line: Don't go into it with so many expectations (I have seen worse) because the reward it promises is not that substantial. As far as acting goes, everyone is equally good at doing what the script calls for with Julianne Moore leading the pack at a nice steady pace.

After teaming up with another man who had lost a child to the plane crash, she begins an escapade to find out what has truly happened to their children (the way all ends up I shall not tell!).

The most common thing I've heard was that people expected it to be a different kind of movie and were let down at what it turned out to be. Obviously these people either didn't see the trailer or didn't give it any thought.The trailer sets up the premise, and the only way someone seeing it could imagine it playing out would be as either: 1) a psychological thriller, 2) an alien abduction movie, 3) a supernatural thriller. Given what's revealed in the trailers, those are pretty much the only options. If you go to the movies often, you probably saw the trailers more than once, in which case it doesn't take any great deductive powers to figure out exactly what it's going to be.From this point on, there may be spoilers!OK, a bit more on the trailer(s)... We see that Julianne Moore's character has lost a son and that people around her have apparently forgotten he ever existed. Next we see that pictures have been altered. At this point, the options are still open. Next we see her ripping the wallpaper and revealing to Dominic West's character that he, too, had a child who apparently died. A few moments later, we see her in official custody with him shouting through the window that he remembers. Since we have two people with shared memories of people who weren't supposed to have ever existed, the psychological thriller plot line is eliminated. This has to be some sort of conspiracy, whether supernatural, alien or pod people. The shots in the trailer aren't creepy enough for a supernatural plot, so that pretty much leaves some sort of aliens. Duh!Knowing this, I went to see it with suitably calibrated expectations. As with all such plots, there were holes and lapses in logic, but surprisingly fewer than I would have expected. Julianne Moore gives a typically excellent performance and the other parts are well cast and performed. I must admit my wife had the nature of Gary Sinese's character nailed while I was still undecided about him.Altogether, not a great flick, but certainly a lot better than many people have given it credit for.

Telly has been in therapy, hoping to come to terms with the loss and move on with a normal life.  Now she notices that things are different.  Her son has disappeared from the family photographs, and any other evidence of his existence has also vanished.  Her therapist and her husband tell her she's finally coming back to reality - that their son never existed in the first place, and her ""memories"" were merely post-traumatic delusions brought on by a miscarriage.  Is it really a case of mental illness, or is she being manipulated by a greater force?  Who would have the power to rearrange her life that way?To say more about the story would be to spoil it.  Its sustained sense of paranoia is reminiscent of The Twilight Zone or The X-Files, with its frequent bird's-eye views giving the viewer the impression that someone is always watching (a very nice touch.)  There's a heavy aura of mystery over the film right up to the end, where much is revealed - but not too much.The artful cinematography, shot mostly in cold blue tones, helps raise the film stylistically above the mass of generic thrillers that are regularly issued.  It's really quite beautiful, as is the score by James Horner, with its prominent piano.  I don't normally register music scores as I'm watching a film, but this one stood out.  Not in an intrusive way.The DVD includes both the theatrical cut and the extended cut with an alternate ending, though it isn't so much a different ending as a slightly different way of getting there.  Both have their merits but I think the sequence in the extended cut works better, and is played better by the actors as well.  In addition to this sequence there are also two brief deleted scenes which you'll see integrated with the extended cut.  There are two featurettes which should only be watched after you've seen the movie.

It's essentially an episode of the Twilight Zone, stretched into a long and tedious movie.  Stripped of filler and reduced to its essentials, this actually could have been an excellent 30-minute TV segment.  There are some interesting ideas in here.  Sadly, as a movie it fails to engage the viewer's interest to any degree.  It's no wonder this movie seems like little more than a long television episode; virtually all of the screenwriter's previous credits are for television material.  Even the direction seems more like TV direction than movie direction.A big problem with this movie is its lack of internal logic.  In any sci-fi or horror movie or book, the events and actions may be as fantastic or unreal as the creators wish, but the audience can only suspend its disbelief if the story hews to some kind of internal logic.  The story must make sense in terms of the ground rules it sets up for itself.  Sadly, toward the end of this movie, any pretense of internal logic goes right through the roof, and the audience is left scratching its head about what exactly went on.The performances are not to blame for the flaws of this film, which is why I give it two stars instead of one; the cast valiantly does its best with the material given to them.This isn't an awful movie; you won't be throwing things at your TV wishing you had 2 hours of your life back after it's over.

The main character goes to great lengths to preserve/discover the memory of her lost son, even though the people around her are convinced she is crazy.Julianne Moore plays the main character, Telly Parada. She performs her role very well, with plenty of emotion. One of her co- stars, Dominic West who plays Ash Correll, is also pretty good. Ash is a guy who lost a daughter in the same plane crash and he, too, cannot recall ever having a daughter when the two meet for the first time after the accident. But Telly's persistence jogs his memory and he realizes he does have a daughter but he has no idea what has happened to her or what has caused his lapse in memory.This movie offers some good suspense and some good shock value. You don't know exactly what will happen and you find yourself slowly putting the pieces of the puzzle together as the film progresses. And there are some great, shocking scenes. Be careful what you have in your hands when you watch this movie because there is a good chance you will end up wearing any food or drink that happens to occupy your fingertips.On the negative side, this movie has some gaping holes in its plot and it leaves many questions unanswered. At the end, you feel relieved that Telly has found out the truth because you can easily see how this ordeal is driving her (and you) crazy. But you don't feel a sense of completeness with so many unresolved issues/questions.Still, the Forgotten is a fairly good movie.

Still, this film keeps your nerves tingling all the way and without excessive gore or violence which is always nice in a thriller. I prefer the mental stimulation as oppsed to the mindless blood bath. Aurally, this movie does great work with music and sounds. Visually I didn't even mind the hand held camera work and the lighting and scene framing was excellent. Reflections and movements in the corner of your eye make you wonder if your mind is playing tricks on you or are the cinematographers just that good.Its the end where this film may fizzle flat.

It is conducting one of its many conspiratorial ""experiments"" on its poor taxpayers again. The experiment is run by someone named Al Patelis (Lee Tegersen).  He appears to be a cheap rip-off of the Terminator. Why he is robotic is never quite clear.Telly's lack of forgetfulness upsets the U.S. government's NSA no end and they send seemingly hundreds of agents, including Al, to catch her and make her forget.

Is it due to the government experiment, or brought on by catching too many hockey pucks to the head before he retired?You may enjoy this movie if you are a runner since the characters also run endlessly throughout.

Julianne Moore plays Telly, a mother who is struggling to move on in life without her 9 year old son who supposedly died in a plane crash.  To make things very strange, she doesn't have any proof that the child exists and everyone from neighbors, doctors, and husband keep telling her that he never existed and that it was all in her head.  Telly never gives up and is determined to prove that he did exist and noone was buying into it until Ash (the father of a daughter who was good friends with her son) was able to recall memories of his daughter that he had forgotten about.  Maybe the booze was part of the reason Ash forgot about his daughter and her son but it seemed strange that noone remembered their children except for them. They team up to try and find clues and discover why things are happening the way they were.  To make matters even crazier, Telly's husband would soon forget all about her and a mysterious NSA agent keeps showing up at times when they are about to unravel some hints that could led them to finding the truth and wither or not the kids are really died and like the creeper in jeepers creepers, he quickly snatches people who are on their side.  Despite all the odds, Telly never gave up. Of course, Telly was fully aware that this agent was involved in all strange events that were occurring as he was there when her son was on the plane.  The agent reveals that this was all an experiment but it never goes into detail as to why this is going on.  We just know it is an expriment and it was designed to make everyone forget that they ever existed but Telly never did forget about her child and was not about to now.  She supposedly breaks the experiment and sees her kid again.  With more detail on the experiment the movie would have been better.

868390,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B0006IIKQW,C. Middleton,"[3, 4]","This unusual feature film seems to have come directly from the offices of Chris Carter. (Millennium, The X Files) When first seeing the previews, I thought, considering the talent, Julianne Moore and Gary Sinese, that this would be a disturbing though sophisticated psychological thriller, a woman haunted from repressed memories, revealing, in the end, a traumatic and evil event. Remembering this past event would be terribly dangerous for her, culminating in a white-knuckle climax. What I didn't expect was this kind of film - a quasi science fictional tale, which, for the most part, leaves the viewer unsatisfied.The performances were all first rate. Julianne Moore is an excellent actress and Gary Sinese as the concerned therapist, although a small role, delivered his usual high standard work. However these fine actors are wasted on a script that was not thought through... perhaps this sounded like a great idea in fifty words or less, pitched to the movie executives over a long, liquid lunch, but the final product misses something, and that is a movie which had the potential to be great and ended up being mediocre.It is impossible to write about this film without giving too much away, though to be fair, a few scenes that used special effects, particularly those characters literally being whisked away into the sky, was quite impressive.There is so much one can do with the notion of memory, false memory and lost memory, in a fictional tale. A great film that comes to mind is the 90's thriller, Memento, directed and written by Christopher Nolen, starring Guy Pearce as the amnesiac and avenger of his wife's killer. This was a clever film that had the audience guessing from beginning to end.The Forgotten starts compellingly, with Telly Parada (Julianne Moore) struggling to cope with the loss of her 9-year old son. In the first ten minutes of the story, mementos such as photos and videos of the boy start to go missing, until every remnant of his existence vanishes. Is Telly delusional? Did she ever have a son? Her psychiatrist seems to think she's loosing her mind and her husband does as well. Telly won't give up, however, looking up another parent who has also lost a child in the same alleged plane crash. As the film progresses we are informed of the secret, and the story slowly becomes a silly moral tale about the indestructible bonds between mother and child.This is one of those films that has a great director, extraordinary talent, a suspenseful soundtrack and great special effects, unfortunately set against a script that would have been rejected by Chris Carter of the X Files as too silly to be even considered.",3,Great potential...,1113609600,"04 16, 2005",2005,2655,"['unusual', 'feature', 'film', 'have', 'come', 'directly', 'offices', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'Millennium', 'X', 'Files', 'When', 'first', 'seeing', 'previews', 'thought', 'considering', 'talent', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Gary', 'Sinese', 'would', 'be', 'disturbing', 'sophisticated', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'woman', 'haunted', 'repressed', 'memories', 'revealing', 'end', 'traumatic', 'evil', 'event', 'Remembering', 'past', 'event', 'would', 'be', 'terribly', 'dangerous', 'culminating', 'white-knuckle', 'climax', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'was', 'kind', 'film', 'quasi', 'science', 'fictional', 'tale', 'most', 'part', 'viewer', 'unsatisfied.The', 'performances', 'were', 'first', 'rate', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'excellent', 'actress', 'Gary', 'Sinese', 'concerned', 'therapist', 'small', 'role', 'delivered', 'usual', 'high', 'standard', 'work', 'However', 'fine', 'actors', 'are', 'wasted', 'script', 'was', 'not', 'thought', 'perhaps', 'sounded', 'great', 'idea', 'fifty', 'words', 'less', 'pitched', 'movie', 'executives', 'long', 'liquid', 'lunch', 'final', 'product', 'something', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'mediocre.It', 'impossible', 'write', 'film', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'be', 'fair', 'few', 'scenes', 'used', 'special', 'effects', 'particularly', 'characters', 'literally', 'being', 'whisked', 'away', 'sky', 'was', 'quite', 'impressive.There', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'can', 'do', 'notion', 'memory', 'false', 'memory', 'lost', 'memory', 'fictional', 'tale', 'great', 'film', 'mind', '90', 'thriller', 'Memento', 'directed', 'written', 'Christopher', 'Nolen', 'starring', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'amnesiac', 'avenger', 'wife', 'killer', 'was', 'clever', 'film', 'had', 'audience', 'guessing', 'beginning', 'end.The', 'Forgotten', 'compellingly', 'Telly', 'Parada', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'struggling', 'cope', 'loss', '9-year', 'old', 'son', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'story', 'mementos', 'such', 'photos', 'videos', 'boy', 'start', 'go', 'missing', 'remnant', 'existence', 'vanishes', 'Telly', 'delusional', 'Did', 'ever', 'have', 'son', 'psychiatrist', 'think', 'loosing', 'mind', 'husband', 'as', 'well', 'Telly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'however', 'looking', 'up', 'parent', 'who', 'also', 'lost', 'child', 'same', 'alleged', 'plane', 'crash', 'film', 'are', 'informed', 'secret', 'story', 'slowly', 'silly', 'moral', 'tale', 'indestructible', 'bonds', 'mother', 'child.This', 'one', 'films', 'great', 'director', 'extraordinary', 'talent', 'suspenseful', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'unfortunately', 'set', 'script', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'rejected', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'X', 'Files', 'too', 'silly', 'be', 'even', 'considered']",N/A

Probably not... directed by Joseph Ruben (Dreamscape, Sleeping with the Enemy), stars Julianne Moore, whom I generally like in films like Boogie Nights and The Big Lebowski, but then wonder sometimes about her choice in appearing in such films like Assassins or The Lost World: Jurassic Park (I didn't think it was possible for me to hate a film with dinosaurs in it, but there you go).  Also appearing is Anthony Edwards, who many may remember as nerdlinger extraordinaire Gilbert Lowell from the first two Revenge of the Nerds films (given all his post `Nerd' credits, I bet he hates when people bring up that role), Dominic West (Rock Star, Mona Lisa Smile), Alfre Woodard (The Core), and Gary Sinise (Reindeer Games, Mission to Mars).Moore is Telly Paretta (every time her name was spoken, I couldn't help picture the late, great Telly Savalas), a woman struggling to overcome the grief of losing her son, who died in a plane crash 14 months earlier.  She regularly peruses pictures, videos, handles the items once belonging to her son, and frequently remembers the last time she saw him, as he was getting on the doomed plane (this particular scene became quite tiresome in its' repetitiveness).  Her husband Jim (Edwards) is worried as Telly's progress in returning to some sort of normality seems very slow, despite the aid of Dr. Jack Munce (Sinise), who is a psychiatrist, or some such medical professional...but what's this?  Soon she's the only one who seems to remember her son, as all material traces begin to vanish, and those who once knew now seem to have, well, forgotten.  Is she going crazy (that was my inclination), or is there something beyond understanding at work (possibly some ornery deity who enjoys yanking chains)?  I'll never tell...unless you pay me...and then I'll spill my guts.I did enjoy Julianne Moore's performance here, even though it felt like she was trying to squeeze a lot more from her character than there actually was (apparently Nicole Kidman was initially set to play Moore's part, probably due to her success in The Others, but other projects may have kept her from doing so)...the story started off well, and seemed to be heading somewhere, but then about halfway through I must have fallen off the train.  The plot (actually, there seemed like three, separate plots working, sometimes against each other) didn't so much derail for me, but got sidetracked in the murky, mishmash wonderland of the obtuse.  Soon after Telly becomes the only one who `remembers', the NSA are on her trail, floundering around, trying to capture her for some unknown reason.  I don't know much about the NSA, short for National Security Agency, but I gotta believe they'd be able to deal with a relatively modest target as Moore's character.  As far as the other actors, if you took all their characters and combined them into one, you might actually get a whole.  Seriously, they'd drift in and out of the story, never really affecting anything, or leaving much trace of their presence (maybe it was meant that way).  I did like the overall look of the film, as it seemed everything had a faint, steely blue hue, and a number of beautiful visuals (many historic NY landmarks), along with interesting shots and sequences that added to the feel of a reality slightly askew from the one we all know and love.  The effects were well done, and kept fairly minimal, helping to preserve a footing in what's real, as opposed to the story which delves in the wholly unreal.  Overall, I enjoyed parts of the film, but the good was about the same level as the bad, effectively canceling each other out, leaving you with...what?  Nothing?  Not really...perhaps a movie worth renting, but nothing to go out of the way for...check out Dark City instead.This edition contains two different endings and allows the viewer to pick which version on the film they want to watch.  I've seen this done on other DVD releases, but rarely are we allowed the choice to watch an entire film with these different endings, leading me to think there was some radical difference between the two...which there wasn't...one ending, the original (the one I prefer, probably because it's shorter) didn't go into as much detail as the alternate, but both shared virtually the same outcome.  The widescreen anamorphic picture looks wonderful on this DVD, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track is quite lively.  Among the special features there's a commentary track (for the theatrical version) by the director and the writer, a 20 minute featurette titled Remembering the Forgotten, another 15 minute featurette titled On the Set: The Making of the Forgotten, deleted scenes (there's three including the alternate ending, if you don't feel like watching the entire film again), theatrical trailers for the film, and a slew of Columbia/Tristars previews.Cookieman108",3,"""There are worse things than forgetting.""",1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,5871,"['had', 'heard', 'maybe', 'one', 'special', 'features',

In the 14 months since the tragedy Moore has spent her time doting over her beloved son's memory, unable to let go.Things start heating up when items such as pictures, newspaper accounts and videos chronicling Sam's existence begin disappearing.  Moore, of course gets frantic because she's the only one that can acknowledge these vanishing items.  Her husband played by a gruesome looking Anthony Edwards is unsympathetic calling her delusional and claiming that there never was a son.  Moore's shrink played blandly by Gary Sinise agrees threatening hospitalization.Moore thinks she's psychotic until she hooks up with acquaintaince Dominic West, an ex-hockey player whose daughter also apparently perished in the same plane crash.  He unfortunately cannot remember his daughter but with prodding from Moore his memory returns.It soon becomes apparent that there is some sort of clandestine government plot as West and Moore are being pursued by federal agents.  This seems to be orchestrated by a mysterious stranger played by Linus Roache who is imbued with supernatural abilities.This flick represents 96 minutes of uninspired movie making.

I really like the performances in the movie and most of the scenes are very effective (although there is much more running and car chasing than a psychological drama really needs).  However, the premise of the movie completely undermines the actual story presented on the screen.Unfortunately, I can't really talk about the plot twists because I don't want to give anything away.  However, let me say this.  Given what is finally revealed in the movie, if that is the real universe this movie inhabits, the story as presented is actually meaningless.  Yes, Telly Paretta's (poignantly played by Julianne Moore) story is sad and we feel for her.  However, there were several characters in this story, given the final state of things, whose story would have been much more interesting and central.  This story is like focusing on a farmer whose pig goes missing in Stalingrad in December 1942 and treating the Nazi invasion as incidental because the farmer gets his favorite pig back.  I mean, aren't there bigger issues here?Anyway, the disk provides an ""extended version with alternate ending"".  There really isn't much extended here, but the alternate ending is better, but still is not enough to really save the movie.So, ok if you like Julianne Moore and if you like sad, moody tales.

It's completly and utterly FORGETTABLE, and I say that mostly because it fails to deliver when it has the chance to.  The plot is actually pretty unique in itself, the idea of waking up one day and having everything you've thought you've known be a lie, the children you've raised never existing and everyone you've ever known is convinced your crazy.  Yeah, so the plot is decent and the acting is pretty good.  Julianne Moore is a good actress and she plays the distressed mother quite well.  So in this film she plays a woman whose son was killed in a plane wreck or so she thought.  She's been seeing a shrink for some time trying to resolve her feelings of loss.  But soon things start to change.  The pictures in the house of her son are gone, his room has changed, his things are missing and all of a sudden her husband and friends and shrink are all saying that she never bore a child and that she's been living a lie for years believing something that never happened.  Add in some aliens and you have a classic B-Grade sci-fi film.  The only problem is that, while building up great suspence and delivering some eerie performances the final few frames just fall to pieces.  It's almost like the writters sat down and said ""we have a great concept and a great two thirds of a script, but I just can't fingure out how to end this $hit...what should we do?"" and the producers said ""anything, I need my movie"" and so they just threw together an ending that is probably the worst ending I've ever seen.  It makes no sense and all the suspence and drama that had built up throughout the film is null in void after watching the pathetic excuse for an ending...and don't even get me started on the alternate ending supplied on the DVD...it's even worse!  I just was dissapointed, as were the critics since for the most part this film was panned.  It has it's moments, and there are a few jumpy scenes, and if it weren't for the appauling ending this film would be a decent thriller (nothing brilliant) but at least stomachable and worth a watch every once in a while, but the ending kills it for me.  And that's why I say it's forgettable, because it builds up speed as it races towards it's finale but it never quite makes it off the runway, it never delivers that final blow that could have sealed the deal and made this a great thriller...instead it fizzles and dies and remains a lame attempt at a cheap thrill.",3,The title works...'Forgettable' would have worked better...,1149033600,"05 31, 2006",2006,2467,"['problem', 'B-Grade', 'thriller', 'completly', 'utterly', 'FORGETTABLE', 'say', 'mostly', 'deliver', 'when', 'chance', 'plot', 'actually', 'pretty', 'unique', 'idea', 'waking', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'having', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'thought', ""'ve"", 'known', 'be', 'lie', 'children', ""'ve"", 'raised', 'never', 'existing', 'everyone', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'known', 'convinced', 'crazy', 'Yeah', 'plot', 'decent', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'good', 'actress', 'distressed', 'mother', 'quite', 'well', 'So', 'film', 'woman', 'son', 'was', 'killed', 'plane', 'wreck', 'so', 'thought', 'been', 'seeing', 'shrink', 'time', 'trying', 'resolve', 'feelings', 'loss', 'soon', 'things', 'start', 'change', 'pictures', 'house', 'son', 'are', 'gone', 'room', 'changed', 'things', 'are', 'missing', 'sudden', 'husband', 'friends', 'shrink', 'are', 'saying', 'never', 'bore', 'child', 'been', 'living', 'lie', 'years', 'believing', 'something', 'never', 'happened', 'Add', 'aliens', 'have', 'classic', 'B-Grade', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'only', 'problem', 'building', 'up', 'great', 'suspence', 'delivering', 'eerie', 'final', 'few', 'frames', 'just', 'fall', 'pieces', 'almost', 'writters', 'sat', 'down', 'said', 'have', 'great', 'concept', 'great', 'two', 'thirds', 'script', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fingure', 'out', 'how', 'end', 'hit', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'producers', 'said', 'anything', 'need', 'movie', 'so', 'just', 'threw', 'together', 'ending', 'probably', 'worst', 'ending', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'sense', 'suspence', 'drama', 'had', 'built', 'up', 'film', 'null', 'void', 'watching', 'pathetic', 'excuse', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'alternate', 'ending', 'supplied', 'DVD', 'even', 'worse', 'just', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'were', 'critics', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'panned', 'moments', 'are', 'few', 'jumpy', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'appauling', 'ending', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'decent', 'thriller', 'nothing', 'brilliant', 'least', 'stomachable', 'worth', 'watch', 'once', 'while', 'ending', 'kills', 'why', 'say', 'forgettable', 'up', 'speed', 'finale', 'never', 'quite', 'off', 'runway', 'never', 'final', 'blow', 'could', 'have', 'sealed', 'deal', 'made', 'great', 'thriller', 'instead', 'dies', 'lame', 'attempt', 'cheap', 'thrill']",N/A

868398,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0006IIKQW,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","Ever since I saw the first trailer, I was fascinated by the premise of this movie - the memory of a dead child being erased from the minds of everyone but his mother - and wondered just how a story like that could possibly end.  Having read some of the reviews, my expectations were a little bit lowered as I finally got the chance to view The Forgotten.  It turns out that I need not have lowered my expectations at all because I loved this movie.  I honestly can't see why so many people were disappointed with it.  I had no preconceived notions of the ending, and I must say the conclusion not only made sense, it felt right to me.  I'm not saying that the whole explanation behind everything doesn't have a few weak spots, but it certainly works for me.  And the special effects - Wow!  I wasn't really looking for any blow-you-away effects, and a couple of them really did a number on me - especially that first one.  I didn't even see it coming.  I wouldn't say I jumped, exactly, but there was definitely a twitch involved with the experience.When you get right down to it, The Forgotten is really about a mother's love - probably the strongest force in the universe - and I think there is really something poignant and life-affirming in my reaction to what I saw here.  Julianne Moore really is a great actress; she is definitely the rock upon which this story is built.  Her character, Telly Paretta, loses everything - first her son in a tragic plane crash, and then what is left of her life as everyone around her forgets the son she is still grieving for.  Every piece of evidence for young Sam's existence disappears - photos, scrapbooks, etc.; her husband insists that they never had a child; and her psychiatrist, Dr. Munce (Gary Sinise), explains to her that she invented all of her memories because of some kind of psychotic break from reality.

I guess the lesson here is that Hollywood has trouble making a good movie from beginning to end (like The Sixth Sense).  I think Hollywood is more interested in making a good TRAILER than they are a good movie so they can make a lot of money in the box office.  The Forgotten is no exception.  The first half an hour or so is very good and Joseph Ruben creates a creepy atmosphere with good performances from Julianne Moore and Dominic West.  However, the movie quickly begins to fall apart (like White Noise) and becomes less and less believable.  I was hoping for a logical explanation, especially since the box of the movie read: ""The biggest jaw-dropper since The Sixth Sense.""  However, the explanation is flimsy and unrealistic and my jaw only dropped at how ridiculous it was.  Nothing at all like when the ending came for Sixth Sense.

I rented this film with the only expectation being that it will probably be something along the lines of an ""X Files"" episode with Julianne Moore in the title role.  Just from the packaging I was reminded of another film, ""The Mothman Prophecies,"" that eerily has more than a few things in common with ""The Forgotten.""

I liked both of those films, and the ""X Files,"" so it is really no surprise that I went along for the ride on this one as well.  There is a mystery to be solved with potential for altering perceptions about our place in the world, or perhaps it is just a showcase for how exquisitely bizarre the workings of the human mind really are.  I enjoyed this mystery tour enough to follow along and be eventually rewarded for my participation.  What sets this film apart from the rest in its genre is that there are some real people at the center of the story, ones that are easy to relate to and worth caring about.  Julianne Moore carries the film on her small shoulders with great depth of character and obviously affecting the performances of all that come into contact with her immense talent.  On the DVD there is a second, alternate ending that is clearly not the better choice; but there is one of the deleted scenes that should have been included in the final cut because I was wondering by film's end what happened to that particular character, and it would have tied up that loose end neatly.

The acting isn't half bad, but I had trouble swallowing the ending because it just doesn't seem to fit quite right.Don't read on if you want to know what happens.Julianne Moore is grieving over the death of her son Sam 14 months earlier. He went on a plane with six other children and it ""crashed""...Or so that's what everyone has been brainwashed/programmed/told(they never really get into how exactly everyone forgot the existence of the six children, or what exactly ""They"" were.) ""They"" begin to start slowly messing with Telly's (Julianne) mind by making her seem as though she's delusional and forgetting everything. Like when she goes out to her car and there's a man sitting in his car across the street where she parked and she asked if he's seen her car because that's where she parked it last night and he points to her car on the other side of the street and sais, ""It happens, I forget where I park my car all the time."" Or, when she's at her therapy session and she reaches over for her coffee, but there's none there and she asks him where her coffee went and he sais she didn't have any today, and she proceeds to say that she can still taste it in her mouth, he explains that because she smells his coffee, she's relaying that into her mind so that she can ""taste"" it, but she didn't actually have any. So, the few remnants of the memories of her child like pictures and a video tape all of the sudden are empty. She is very upset and confronts her husband who sais they never had a child. They both go to the therapist and he tells her that she is suffering a psychotic break and that she made up a whole different life with a child, and that none of it was real. She refuses to believe this and goes to see the father of another child who was ""killed"". She rips all of the wallpaper off that covered his daughters room, but he still doesnt believe her and the feds come and take her. He stops them because he suddenly remembers his daughter and they run. They continue to run from the feds and play detective and try to figure out what is going on. So, it turns out that it's all part of an ""alien""(?) experiment, that really doesnt have anything to do with the children, but the parents and the mothers maternal instinct for her child. Everyone in the world mostly the feds know and cooperate with ""them"", and some, like the therapist know and cooperate, most others are just their guinea pigs.So...it's pretty much just a sad excuse for an X-Files episode turned into a movie.",3,Eh...,1107475200,"02 4, 2005",2005,2551,"['storyline', ""n't"", 'most', 'original', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'acting', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', 'had', 'trouble', 'swallowing', 'ending', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'quite', 'right.Do', ""n't"", 'read', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'happens.Julianne', 'Moore', 'grieving', 'death', 'son', 'Sam', '14', 'months', 'earlier', 'went', 'plane', 'six', 'other', 'children', 'crashed', 'what', 'everyone', 'been', 'brainwashed/programmed/told', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'how', 'exactly', 'everyone', 'forgot', 'existence', 'six', 'children', 'what', 'exactly', 'were', 'begin', 'start', 'slowly', 'messing', 'Telly', 'Julianne', 'mind', 'making', 'seem', 'delusional', 'forgetting', 'everything', 'when', 'out', 'car', 'man', 'sitting', 'car', 'street', 'where', 'parked', 'asked', 'seen', 'car', 'where', 'parked', 'last', 'night', 'car', 'other', 'side', 'street', 'sais', 'forget', 'where', 'park', 'car', 'time', 'when', 'therapy', 'session', 'coffee', 'none', 'there', 'where', 'coffee', 'went', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'today', 'say', 'can', 'still', 'taste', 'mouth', 'coffee', 'relaying', 'mind', 'can', 'taste', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'have', 'So', 'few', 'remnants', 'memories', 'child', 'pictures', 'video', 'tape', 'sudden', 'are', 'empty', 'very', 'upset', 'husband', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'child', 'go', 'therapist', 'suffering', 'psychotic', 'break', 'made', 'up', 'whole', 'different', 'life', 'child', 'none', 'was', 'real', 'believe', 'see', 'father', 'child', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'wallpaper', 'covered', 'daughters', 'room', 'still', 'believe', 'feds', 'come', 'take', 'suddenly', 'daughter', 'run', 'continue', 'run', 'feds', 'play', 'detective', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'So', 'out', 'part', 'alien', 'experiment', 'really', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'children', 'parents', 'mothers', 'maternal', 'instinct', 'child', 'Everyone', 'world', 'mostly', 'feds', 'know', 'cooperate', 'therapist', 'know', 'cooperate', 'most', 'others', 'are', 'just', 'guinea', 'pigs.So', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'sad', 'excuse', 'X-Files', 'episode', 'turned', 'movie']",N/A

Alfre Woodard plays a detective who starts to think that there are just too many weird things going on and reaches out to try to help Telly.The movie does not totally wrap up all the loose ends, and without giving any spoilers, I'll just say that I never was quite sure why the children were taken.

All of the elements are there; a strong cast (Julianne Moore, Dominic West, Gary Sinise), a fascinating plot, eerie music and cinematography, and enough on-screen jolts to leave you with an empty popcorn bag by film's end.The problem is this; the screenwriters set up such an enigmatic, mind-boggling story that it soon became apparent to me that a plausible, satisfying explanation would not be possible.  And I was right.  ""The Forgotten"" starts off with great promise but it ultimately has nowhere to go.  The script becomes so tripped-up in itself that it ultimately results to cheap, supernatural occurrences in order to explain away everything that's happened throughout the entire film.  I felt cheated.Once the filmmakers resort to a certain overly-used special effect to pull their picture out of a nosedive, ""The Forgotten"" shape-shifts from a psychological thriller to science fiction and lastly to comedy, and unintentional comedy at that.This wasn't easy film to bring together, I'm sure. The filmmakers tried to keep a balance between creepy weirdness and unbelievability. However, the final premise was just a little too silly to really believe. I was frustrated with this film because I think it actually backed itself into a corner, and then took the clich&eacute; out.Overall, ""The Forgotten"" is a truly frightening and entertaining film despite its glaring story problems.

Gold light being Telly's memories with her son.  As the memories keep growing, the gold light gets brighter.  Alien symbolism includes helicopter shots (at the beginning especially), cloud effects, slight eerie sounds, and even the scene of the rooftop playground around 35:00.  Library lights are like saucers.A factoid is that the motel in the movie had prostitutes in it.  Also, the Wall St. bull is in it, and apparently is a tourist monument.As an actress, Moore is really flexible being able to show joy or determination, and apparently able to be facetious off camera only about 3 seconds before acting.  She seems perfectly in character and fits well with the situation at all times.  Dominic West (Ashe Correll) also felt played his role as a former hockey player very well.There is no overly done romance except for a predictable hollywood kiss when they are in a bed scene together.Telly escapes a little too easily from Shineer's house which makes the story not cohesive enough.  That is the only thing that really sticks out as questionable in the movie, otherwise the plot and the suspense work well to keep some movie viewers interested.The alternate ending for the movie was too confusing with too many details, but more interesting than the ending used.

868433,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0006IIKQW,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","THE FORGOTTEN has as many mixed reviews as about any movie of the last season and for folks who like to feel secure about plot lines from beginning to end, that disparity of response is warranted.  But for the casual viewer who just picks up this DVD to view because something  (the cast, the graphics, the tone) appealed, this is a fine little thriller that engages your interest and your compassion and ultimately your mind.It has been 14 months since an airplane with five Brooklyn children went down at sea and Telly (the always impressive Julianne Moore) is still grieving for her lost 9-year-old son Sam.  She savors photographs, memories (in flashback sequences which are about as tender as mother/son relationships have been pictured), and yet cannot let go and move on.  Her husband (Anthony Edwards) is supportive as is her psychiatrist (Gary Sinise), but gradually Telly discovers that photographs and memorabilia of her son Sam have been altered or have disappeared.  Confrontation with her husband results in her being told that she never had a son, that she is delusional, and all of her support systems vanish.  Convinced she is right she encounters Ash (Dominic West) who, though now a drunk, was 'apparently' the single father of Sam's best friend Lauren, although on the surface he denies ever having a child.  Telly finds ways to convince Ash to remember and together they set out on a string of events that leads to occult questions about 'The Experiment' that is apparently known to the FBI (among them Lee Tergesen) but has not convinced the local law enforcement (Alfre Woodward).  Odd creature signs appear (in the character of the alien-like Linus Roache), and Telly and Ash are on the run, determined that their children are alive, and in the end the quest of the 'experiment' to discover the particular bond between mother (or father) and child is strained to the bizarre conclusion.The script by Gerald DiPege and the direction by Joseph Ruben work well in synchrony and though the story may offend viewers who disdain the possibility of life outside the earth's surface, the amount of emphasis on parent/child relationships far outweighs the potential hokiness of the manner in which that aspect of the film is challenged.  Julianne Moore, Dominic West, Alfre Woodward, and Gary Sinise give excellent performances (along with a superb supporting cast) and the commitment these actors display makes the movie solid.  Ease up on credibility issues, go out on a limb,  and take this flight of fantasy as a means to explore larger issues and you'll find this film has more merit than you would expect.

Sam died over a year before in a plane crash at sea, so we think.This movie takes a look at the love a mother has for her child and the bond that creates and asks what happens if that bond is severed.Julienne Moore gives an emotional performance that had me feeling the pain her character was going through. She plays Telly Perretta, a woman who is not sure if her son ever existed, or if she made him up because of a stillborn pregnancy and is losing her mind.Dominic West gave a wonderful performance as a single father, which I love seeing, who has also lost a daughter in the same accident. Unlike Moore's character, though, he has forgotten that he ever had a daughter. Ash was a hockey player for the NHL and now has a raging drinking problem. I felt it was a tad bit unrealistic that Ash would give up drinking on the spot, apparently never have another craving, and all because of a couple of dirty looks from Telly Perretta.Gary Sinise, of Forest Gump fame, gives a wonderfully understated performance as Dr. Munce, the therapist that tries to convince Telly that her son never existed. He seems so empathetic and genuinely caring that it didn't make me hate him when it turns out he is working for the bad guys.Alfre Woodard has a small roll as Detective Anne Pope. Only Woodard could take this small, but important character, and turn her into someone that sticks in your mind. She is a New York City detective who is called in when Telly and Ash go on the run to try and find out what happened to their children. There is a great scene between Woodard and a couple of NSA agents where Woodard really puts the agents in their place.Linus Roache plays the alien conducting the experiment that causes Telly and Ash so much pain. He does very well with giving off a mysterious air until the end when all is revealed. I have to admit, my favorite scene with Roache is when his experiment fails because Moore remembers being pregnant and he looks up, says, ""I need more ti"" and is sucked into the sky. I still haven't figured out why Roache is mysterious and rather stoney faced throughout the movie, except for when Sam is getting on the airplane. I feel like he should never have showed emotion if he was an alien, but that is just my humble opinion.Anthony Edwards deserves a mention as Jim, Telly's husband. He does come off as a bit wishy-washy, but it plays perfectly in the context of the movie. I love the scene between Jim and Telly when Edwards' character has forgotten Telly. He manages to give that vibe of friendly and a little interested, but not at all slimy.I really like this film because it doesn't rely on blood and guts and gore to be scary. The suspense is well timed, there is romance, but no softcore porn. I love the underlying message, that love can conquer all. My seven year old loves scary movies and being scared, but it is hard to find movies that are not too violent and full of blood and guts and not full of sex.

She's having trouble moving on. Suddenly, her husband and psychiatrist tell her that she never had a son, that she made him up as a result of having a stillborn baby years ago. She sets out to prove that she indeed did have a son, and to find out what really happened to him. She encounters Ash (Dominic West) who had a daughter that was friends with her son Sam. He doesn't remember at first, but after she exposes his daughter Lauren's room by uncovering the wallpaper in his office, he remembers. Suddenly they are on the run from the FBI, both trying to prove that their children existed, and are still alive.

She's been grieving for over a year, and like a prisoner counting the days incarcerated, she can recite the time since his death down to the millisecond.The thing is, everyone is telling her she's delusional.  Even though she swears he lived, and subsequently died in a plane crash, everyone, her shrink (Gary Sinise), and even her husband Jim are telling her the kid didn't exist.  They even go so far as to remove all personal objects one day when she is gone, just so they can convince her she is insane.  Telly, on the other hand, knows what she remembers, and enlists the help of Ash Correll (Dominic West), the father of a little girl who was killed on the same plane flight.  Ash doesn't remember his daughter, but with some help from Telly, and the Detective on the case (Alfre Woodard), they are able to convince Ash.I suppose this could have been taken two ways.  One, we know beforehand that she had a kid, and the kid is missing, but everyone is trying to convince her otherwise.  Or, two, the suspense and mystery is lengthened so that we are unsure if she is actually delusional or not.  As it stands, we know she is telling the truth, and that all others are attemping to convince her otherwise for some strange reason.Anyway, the suspense is top-notch, and the audience is kept guessing until the very end.  It's god an eerie, old-school Alfred Hitchcock feel to it.  What I mean by that is the story is told in such a way that there is genuine intrigue, and not the foreshadowing nonsense of most contemporary movies that allows the audience to figure things out about halfway through the viewing.Be on the lookout for a specific special effects scene in which a reverse bungee jump type maneuver is accomplished.

She has lost her son in a plane crash with several other children.  We come in on the movie some time later as she is seeing a therapist and still dealing with the loss.  She constantly revisits photos, toys, baseball paraphernalia and books that her son had in order to keep remembering him.  His room is still just as it was and she can't seem to let go of his memory long enough to get back to her real life.When she suddenly starts to see evidence of her son missing, thinking it's her husbands doing in order to help her let go, she gets angry and is told by her therapist (Gary Sinese) that she never had a son, that she had made it up in her head.  She finds a fellow parent (Dominic West) who also lost his daughter in the crash but doesn't believe she ever existed.  Together they begin putting together pieces of the puzzle that lead to a striking revelation.Many people may think the shift to Science Fiction in the middle may be a cop out, but to try explaining it any other way would be ludicrous.  Juliana Moore gives a strong performance as always in another one of her mediocre choices of movies.  The movie is dark and creepy with washed out color and overcast outdoor shots, making the film look bleak.

The mood and atmosphere of the film was eerie and creepy, but nothing we haven't seen before. Julianne Moore did an excellent job as the terrified, confused and frightened mother, who has been told her son, who has been dead for 14 months, never existed. However, her abilities start to fall apart at about the same time as the movie does.This film begins to build a dynamic story very early on. Great twists and turns in this movie, so much so that I don't want to mention very much, except the initial premise that Julian Moore has been grieving for years about her lost son, and suddenly her husband, her doctor - everyone - has no memory of her son, they act is if Julianne has lost her mind. Unfortunately, it gets lost in itself and crumbles towards the middle and especially by the end.What probably started out as a decent alien abduction flick, turned sour and became another in a long line of Sixth Sense or The X-Files rip-offs. There was nothing that really jumped out and grabbed the viewer by the throat and made them afraid for their own children. I think that really could have been the selling point of this film. The make people afraid to let their children out of their sight. I mean, the idea of this happening in real life would be the scariest part of all. This film was building up to that, but again, it crumbled way too fast. The ending was different, but bland. Julianne Moore's character is able to overcome the odd experiment she is being forced through, because her love for her son is too strong.The Forgotten has some good action, some good mystery; and it would be an excellent Twilight Zone material.

The premise is solid, with only a few weak points, and the special affects are stunning.As for plot.......A mother's life suddenly turns from bad to horrid when all the remnants of her dead son - pictures, video clips, etc. - suddenly turn up missing, as if he's been completely wiped-out from the memory banks of the world.

Telly begins to become convinced that her husband is removing all evidence of her son's existence, such as videotapes and photographs. To her shock and horror, both Jim and Jack inform her that Sam never existed and was simply her mind playing tricks on her after an unfortunate miscarriage.Telly flees and goes to the only person she thinks will understand her plight, turned alcoholic Ash Correll (played by DOMINIC WEST) whose daughter perished in the plane crash along with Sam and others. Yet, Ash states he never had a daughter, a point that only confuses and frustrates Telly even more, as she knows she can't be going crazy.Ash calls the police, but when they arrive to get her, so does NSA agent Carl Dayton (played by ROBERT WISDOM).

Later, as she goes through her son's photos, belongings, and home movie clips, you hear Telley talking with her Psychiatrist (Gary Sinise--aka Lieutenant Dan in Forrest Gump) about the loss of her 9 year old son, Sam, 14  months ago.  It seems several children boarded a plane and there was a plane accident.  Husband James Paretta (Anthony Edwards) seems supportive.  She has regular sessions with the Psychiatrist.  Telley is forgetting little things here and there, but we all do that.  Then, photos of Sam disappear, as do home movies.  Sam even disappears from family photos, as if he never existed.  All traces of him are gone. Telley blames her husband for getting rid of the memories, but then the Psychiatrist explains she never had a son, but a miscarriage.  He says her mind made it all up.  While James is present, the doctor threatens to hospitalize Telley (for her own good, of course).Knowing this is all a lie, and realizing they are all against her, Telley takes off on the run.  She goes to a male acquaintance who also lost his daughter on the same flight.  All of a sudden, the FBI and the National Security Agency are involved.

The only thing I could figure out was that both Julianne Moore and Dominic West were playing characters who could afford to let their children go on special plane flights for kids on QuestAir, but you don't have to be a millionaire to go on a plane, and these people are living in these fantastic apartments that are easily as big as plane hangars.  They're all gloomy too, well, that figures.  It's like GREY GARDENS without the occasional musical numbers.How many times does Julianne Moore have to introduce herself with the catchy mnemomyic, ""I'm Telly Paretta""?  Someone, perhaps the hard-working psychiatrist played by Gary Sinise, should have asked her why her mom and dad named her after TV's KOJAK and saved himself months and months of analytical discovery.  Sinise is the only actor who could have played this part, Dr. Muntz, who browbeats the police into letting him accompany them at all times for he must be there when they recapture Telly otherwise she'll suffer a psychotic break.  Yeah, like the police would really pay attention to this worry wart.  And yet the plot is constructed so that this has to happen.  I also enjoyed the part where Telly, adopting the pleasant guise of a personal assistant, tricks an auditor into giving up a suspect's home address: ""165 Colony Road, Long Island.""  Gee, that'll be easy to find!  Didn't they want to name a real town?Anyhow I loved the movie and couldn't bear to see it end.  I bought it for my own DVD collection and probably will see it over and over, it will help me with my own feelings of anxiety and inadequacy about not having kids.  You know how sometimes one wakes up feeling so spacey that, if Anthony Edwards told me I had had a miscarriage and didn't really have any children at all, I'd believe him, for he has such an innocent face and it's so great he got a part in a major studio movie again after being stigmatized by his ""Mark Green"" role in ER for for many years during which time he was graylisted by Hollywood and went completely, utterly, bald like Otto Preminger.",3,Give Me Your First Memory,1150675200,"06 19, 2006",2006,2187,"['kept', 'waiting', 'part', 'story', 'make', 'clear', 'why', 'main', 'characters', 'lived', 'such', 'giant', 'oversized', 'New', 'York', 'apartments', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'was', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Dominic', 'West', 'were', 'playing', 'characters', 'who', 'could', 'afford', 'let', 'children', 'go', 'special', 'plane', 'flights', 'kids', 'QuestAir', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'millionaire', 'go', 'plane', 'people', 'are', 'living', 'fantastic', 'apartments', 'are', 'easily', 'as', 'big', 'plane', 'hangars', ""'re"", 'gloomy', 'too', 'well', 'GREY', 'GARDENS', 'occasional', 'musical', 'numbers.How', 'many', 'times', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'have', 'introduce', 'catchy', 'mnemomyic', ""'m"", 'Telly', 'Paretta', 'Someone', 'perhaps', 'hard-working', 'psychiatrist', 'played', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'should', 'have', 'asked', 'why', 'mom', 'dad', 'named', 'TV', 'KOJAK', 'saved', 'months', 'months', 'analytical', 'discovery', 'Sinise', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'part', 'Dr.', 'Muntz', 'who', 'police', 'letting', 'accompany', 'times', 'must', 'be', 'there', 'when', 'recapture', 'Telly', 'otherwise', ""'ll"", 'suffer', 'psychotic', 'break', 'Yeah', 'police', 'would', 'really', 'pay', 'attention', 'worry', 'wart', 'yet', 'plot', 'constructed', 'so', 'happen', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'part', 'where', 'Telly', 'adopting', 'pleasant', 'guise', 'personal', 'assistant', 'auditor', 'giving', 'up', 'suspect', 'home', 'address', '165', 'Colony', 'Road', 'Long', 'Island', 'Gee', ""'ll"", 'be', 'easy', 'find', 'Did', ""n't"", 'want', 'name', 'real', 'town', 'Anyhow', 'loved', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'bear', 'see', 'end', 'bought', 'own', 'DVD', 'collection', 'probably', 'will', 'see', 'will', 'help', 'own', 'feelings', 'anxiety', 'inadequacy', 'not', 'having', 'kids', 'know', 'how', 'sometimes', 'one', 'up', 'feeling', 'so', 'spacey', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'told', 'had', 'had', 'miscarriage', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'children', ""'d"", 'believe', 'innocent', 'face', 'so', 'great', 'got', 'part', 'major', 'studio', 'movie', 'again', 'being', 'stigmatized', 'Mark', 'Green', 'role', 'ER', 'many', 'years', 'time', 'was', 'graylisted', 'Hollywood', 'went', 'completely', 'utterly', 'bald', 'Otto', 'Preminger']",N/A
868466,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B0006IIKQW,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[2, 5]","The Forgotten starts off with an interesting premise--a bereaved mother who finds everyone forgetting about her son--and progresses to some moments of great tension, but ultimately is a disappointment.The look of the movie is vintage X-Files, with its gritty realism and its hand-held camera work.  The visual texture of the film reflects the emotional progression of our heroine, Telly Paretta (Julianne Moore).  However, it also tries to bring us in on the director's mindset.  I agree that Moore is a beautiful woman, but the long lingering shots of her face and body slow down the progression of the plot.Paretta is accompanied in her effort to weed out her frustration by Ash Correll (Dominic West), who loses the memory of his daughter but then recovers it.  Ash is an interesting character, but the enforced sexual tension between him and Paretta is distracting and, since nothing ever comes of it, a red herring on the part of writer Gerald Di Pego and director Joseph Rubin.These leads are supplemented with a million-dollar supporting cast, including Anthony Edwards, Alfre Woodard, Robert Wisdom, and Gary Sinese.  All the actors work hard to create a careful and nuanced ensemble performance, and I really enjoyed watching them.  However, they all seem to be held hostage to the tender mercies of the script, which doesn't relent an inch.For example, in an attempt to frustrate Paretta's investigation of why everyone forgot her son, they also wipe away her marriage.  Her husband has no idea who she is.  But the police investigation he initiated on her behalf continues.  Why?  Because the plot demands it.The plot demands are unforgiving to the characters.  There are three major twists in the story.  I saw two of them less than fifteen minutes into the story, but the third, having to do with Sinese as Paretta's psychiatrist, came so far out of left field and was so unearned that, at a key moment when I should have been powerfully empathic with these characters, I only wanted to jeer.There are also a lot of scares in this movie.  In this way, as with others, it tries to mimic the success of the X-Files.  But rather than building on creeping dread or a fear of the unknown, the scares are based on jolts and shoults of ""Boo!""  I jumped several times as I was watching, but I doubt if I went back and saw this film a second time that I'd be particularly flustered.Perhaps the biggest problem with this movie was that it seems to have been transplanted from another script.  Or several.  With the flexing of reality around our protagonist, I kept expecting Hugo Weaving to appear around the corner and growl, ""Mr. Anderson...""  And with the number of men in black, I was waiting for the one rogue, played by David Duchovny, to try and unseat them.This movie isn't out-and-out bad.  It has a good underlying premise, an engaging look, and characters we genuinely want to care about.  But the movie is hostage to the writer and director, who seem to want the audience to react so specifically that they're not above manipulating the world of the film to get that.Wait for the DVD to come out with this one--it's good, but not good enough to justify the steep price of theater tickets.",3,X-Files Redux,1096070400,"09 25, 2004",2004,3203,"['Forgotten', 'off', 'interesting', 'premise', 'bereaved', 'mother', 'who', 'everyone', 'forgetting', 'son', 'moments', 'great', 'tension', 'ultimately', 'disappointment.The', 'look', 'movie', 'vintage', 'X-Files', 'gritty', 'realism', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'work', 'visual', 'texture', 'film', 'emotional', 'progression', 'heroine', 'Telly', 'Paretta', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'However', 'also', 'bring', 'director', 'mindset', 'agree', 'Moore', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'long', 'lingering', 'shots', 'face', 'body', 'slow', 'down', 'progression', 'plot.Paretta', 'accompanied', 'effort', 'weed', 'out', 'frustration', 'Ash', 'Correll', 'Dominic', 'West', 'who', 'memory', 'daughter', 'then', 'Ash', 'interesting', 'character', 'enforced', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Paretta', 'distracting', 'nothing', 'ever', 'red', 'herring', 'part', 'writer', 'Gerald', 'Di', 'Pego', 'director', 'Joseph', 'Rubin.These', 'leads', 'are', 'supplemented', 'million-dollar', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'Robert', 'Wisdom', 'Gary', 'Sinese', 'actors', 'work', 'hard', 'create', 'careful', 'nuanced', 'ensemble', 'performance', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'However', 'seem', 'be', 'held', 'hostage', 'tender', 'mercies', 'script', ""n't"", 'relent', 'inch.For', 'example', 'attempt', 'frustrate', 'Paretta', 'investigation', 'why', 'everyone', 'forgot', 'son', 'also', 'wipe', 'away', 'marriage', 'husband', 'idea', 'who', 'police', 'investigation', 'initiated', 'behalf', 'Why', 'plot', 'it.The', 'plot', 'demands', 'are', 'unforgiving', 'characters', 'are', 'three', 'major', 'twists', 'story', 'saw', 'two', 'less', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'story', 'third', 'having', 'do', 'Sinese', 'Paretta', 'psychiatrist', 'came', 'so', 'far', 'left', 'field', 'was', 'so', 'unearned', 'key', 'moment', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'powerfully', 'empathic', 'characters', 'only', 'wanted', 'jeer.There', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'scares', 'movie', 'way', 'others', 'mimic', 'success', 'X-Files', 'rather', 'building', 'creeping', 'dread', 'fear', 'unknown', 'scares', 'are', 'based', 'jolts', 'shoults', 'Boo', 'jumped', 'several', 'times', 'was', 'watching', 'doubt', 'went', 'back', 'saw', 'film', 'second', 'time', ""'d"", 'be', 'particularly', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'have', 'been', 'transplanted', 'script', 'several', 'flexing', 'reality', 'protagonist', 'kept', 'expecting', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'appear', 'corner', 'growl', 'Mr.', 'Anderson', 'number', 'men', 'black', 'was', 'waiting', 'one', 'rogue', 'played', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'try', 'unseat', 'them.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'out-and-out', 'bad', 'good', 'underlying', 'premise', 'engaging', 'look', 'characters', 'genuinely', 'want', 'care', 'movie', 'hostage', 'writer', 'director', 'who', 'seem', 'want', 'audience', 'react', 'so', 'specifically', ""'re"", 'not', 'manipulating', 'world', 'film', 'get', 'that.Wait', 'DVD', 'come', 'out', 'one', 'good', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'justify', 'steep', 'price', 'theater', 'tickets']",N/A

It had a little suspense, a little mystery, and even some action tossed all together.  The plot was good, though it dragged just a little bit too much.  The film plays out almost as if it were an episode of ""The X-Files,"" with Fox and Scully swapped with a mother(Julianne Moore) insistent that she isn't going crazy and a washed-up, alcoholic ex-hockey player.The story goes something like this:  A grieving mother who has lost her son in a plane accident has been told that she never had a son and that there never was a plane crash.  Her husband, her shrink, and her neighbors think that she is losing it.  She seeks to find proof that she did have a son.  That gets a little tough when all of her son's pictures, videos, etc. start to go missing.  She teams up with another parent(the hockey player) who doesn't remember his daughter at first, but is quickly reminded by a stressful confrontation with Julianne Moore's character.  After that, the story just gets more and more twisted.  Things don't add up.  People go missing, etc. etc.Without giving anymore details away, just know that this film is okay.  I probably won't buy it on DVD, but I may rent it.  It is enjoyable and there are some ""jump-at-ya"" scares that wake you up during the lulls of the plot.  If you like ""X-Files"" type mystery, you'll like this flick.  If you like your sci-fi with pop and sizzle special effects, don't bother.

Thus, consider yourself warned before you continue to read the full review.Forgotten opens with a number of very good shots where the camera seems to be floating high up in the air watching down on the city of New York and the people as if they were ants.  These shots bring a nauseating experience if you suffer from fear of heights, as the camera ultimately lands in a playground where Telly Paretta (Julianne Moore) sits on a swing.  Telly appears to be deep into her thoughts as she moves from the playground to a child's room in her home where she begins to fondle a baseball glove as if she tries to remember something.  Consequently, the audience finds out that she has lost her son, Sam, about 14 months earlier in a plane crash.Shortly after the opening, the film gets into a similar theme to Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind (2004), which focuses on the element of voluntary amnesia in cases of painful memories.  In Forgotten everyone else, except Telly, seems to suffer from amnesia, as she is the only one that remembers her son.  The people close to her believe that she suffers from severe delusions and is slightly psychotic, as she acts as if she has created a memory from having a still-borne child.In panic, Telly flees her persecutors, and begins to investigate Sam's plane crash.  Telly discovers that all the news in regards to her son's accident is suddenly gone.  In search for some conformation of her son's existence Telly bumps into another parent, Ash Correll (Dominic West), who she recalls also lost a child in the same accident.  Ash does not seem to recognize her, but Telly remains persistent as he somehow finds out that he once had a daughter.  Together Telly and Ash embark on troublesome journey to uncover the truth in regards to their children, as an unknown enemy seems to pull the strings from a high place--pun intended.The film initially sets up with an interesting plot with amnesia and psychological suspense.  However, it quickly turns into a quagmire as the film turns into a bad episode of the TV series X-Files.  Many of the ideas are never completed and instead of completing a notion it jumps a new thought, which convolutes the cinematic experience.  On occasion, Forgotten shines with remarkable effects, good cinematography, and great possibility.  In addition, Julianne Moore offers, as usual, a solid performance.  But it does not save the film, as it never come close to cinematic greatness, as the audience will feel that it might best be forgotten.",2,Forgotten - Forgets to Deliver...,1106179200,"01 20, 2005",2005,2610,"['review', 'spoilers', 'might', 'affect', 'potential', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'Thus', 'consider', 'warned', 'continue', 'read', 'full', 'review.Forgotten', 'number', 'very', 'good', 'shots', 'where', 'camera', 'be', 'floating', 'high', 'up', 'air', 'watching', 'down', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'people', 'were', 'ants', 'shots', 'bring', 'nauseating', 'experience', 'suffer', 'fear', 'heights', 'camera', 'ultimately', 'playground', 'where', 'Telly', 'Paretta', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'swing', 'Telly', 'be', 'deep', 'thoughts', 'playground', 'child', 'room', 'home', 'where', 'fondle', 'baseball', 'glove', 'remember', 'something', 'Consequently', 'audience', 'out', 'lost', 'son', 'Sam', 'about', '14', 'months', 'earlier', 'plane', 'crash.Shortly', 'opening', 'film', 'similar', 'theme', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', '2004', 'element', 'voluntary', 'amnesia', 'cases', 'painful', 'memories', 'Forgotten', 'everyone', 'else', 'Telly', 'suffer', 'amnesia', 'only', 'one', 'son', 'people', 'close', 'believe', 'severe', 'delusions', 'slightly', 'psychotic', 'created', 'memory', 'having', 'still-borne', 'child.In', 'panic', 'Telly', 'persecutors', 'investigate', 'Sam', 'plane', 'crash', 'Telly', 'news', 'regards', 'son', 'accident', 'suddenly', 'gone', 'search', 'conformation', 'son', 'existence', 'Telly', 'parent', 'Ash', 'Correll', 'Dominic', 'West', 'who', 'also', 'lost', 'child', 'same', 'accident', 'Ash', 'not', 'seem', 'recognize', 'Telly', 'persistent', 'somehow', 'out', 'once', 'had', 'daughter', 'Telly', 'Ash', 'embark', 'troublesome', 'journey', 'uncover', 'truth', 'regards', 'children', 'unknown', 'enemy', 'pull', 'strings', 'high', 'place', 'pun', 'intended.The', 'film', 'initially', 'up', 'interesting', 'plot', 'amnesia', 'psychological', 'suspense', 'However', 'quickly', 'quagmire', 'film', 'bad', 'episode', 'TV', 'series', 'X-Files', 'Many', 'ideas', 'are', 'never', 'completed', 'instead', 'completing', 'notion', 'new', 'thought', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'occasion', 'Forgotten', 'remarkable', 'effects', 'good', 'cinematography', 'great', 'possibility', 'addition', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'offers', 'usual', 'solid', 'performance', 'not', 'save', 'film', 'never', 'come', 'close', 'cinematic', 'greatness', 'audience', 'will', 'feel', 'might', 'best', 'be', 'forgotten']",N/A

At best, there's a few ""thrilling"" parts to it, including probably the best and most effective car crash I've ever seen in a movie, a couple of kinda freaky parts with people being sucked into the sky and an alright idea for a story. At worst, a lot of the dialogue in the movie just flat out seemed phony to me, especially in the early scenes where Telly (Julianne Moore) is freaking out on her husband for changing the picture and freaking out on her psychiatrist for telling her that her son Sam never existed. This rather cheesy dialogue in this early of the movie made the rest of the film hard to take seriously.The biggest drawback in the movie for me was its anticlimactic ending. Very non exciting and predictable. I watched the ending of the extended version with the alternate ending hoping that maybe it was just the studio's fault for producing such a weak ending, but I honestly couldn't tell any difference between the theatrical ending which I just watched and the alternate ending.

868478,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006IIKQW,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[50, 56]","I got really anxious when I put in the DVD for ""The Forgotten"" and was given an option of watching the original theatrical release or the extended version with an alternate ending.  Given what I knew about this 2004 film, to wit, a mother is the only one who remembers that she had a son, I was worried that the two endings might represents completely opposite resolutions to the situation.  Fortunately, that is not the case, and I think the alternate ending is slightly stronger than the original (actually, to a great extent they are pretty compatible).  But the proliferation of alternative endings on DVDs worries me, because if you are not sure where your movie is going to end when you start making it I think you are in serious trouble.  Besides, I have horrid visions of the alternate endings for ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Casablanca.""""The Forgotten"" is a film with an interesting idea, but the trailer gives away a bit too much so that you have no doubt as to which way you are supposed to be leaning on this one.  Telly Paretta (Julianne Moore), has been mourning the death of her 9-year-old son, Sam, for over a year (she can do months, days, and hours).  Sam was killed in an airplane crash, along with nine other kids.  Telly is seeing a psychiatrist, Dr. Munce (Gary Sinise), but resisting treatment, the goal of which is for her to spend less time each day looking at Sam's toys and photographs of the boy.  Then she comes home one day and finds everything is gone and her husband, Jim (Anthony Edwards) is insisting she never had a child but had suffered a miscarriage.The idea of a woman who has created a fictional child who ends up getting killed is rather compelling (even if you are suddenly thinking ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?""), but that is not what is going on here.  This is one of those movies were a mom, against great odds, fights for her child.  Part of the problem with ""The Forgotten"" is that the odds against which Tally is fighting might be the greatest in human history.  While this is also an interesting idea, it is played out against such monumental odds that the point Gerald Di Pego's script is trying to make about the power of a mother's love gets a bit lost.Tally is able to enlist a couple of allies, Ash Correll (Dominic West), an ex-hockey player who does not remember the daughter Telly insists he had, and Detective Ann Pope (Alfre Woodard), who is suspicious of the feds chasing a crazy women and who finds it hard to believe that two people would be suffering parallel delusions.  But the initial flaw in this film is that we know Tally is not crazy from the start and I really believe that ambiguity needs to be a bigger part of the first act of the film.  The longer the film cuts both ways, the stronger this sort of story tends to be.  But director Joseph Ruben apparently does not recognize this is the smart way to go.The major flaw with this film is that once we get to THE EXPLANATION as to what is going on, your awe over the sheer magnitude of the power and magnitude of what is going on is mitigated by the simple question of ""why go to all the bother?""  After all, when you think about the final scene, it sure seems like a bit much for a statistical aberration, and that is without even getting into the whole question of how it is done (not that any explanation would be forthcoming, but you can appreciate the idea).This is too bad because not only is the idea of a woman inventing a fictional child rather interesting, Moore provides an anguished performance as this particular mother, capturing both the pain of loss and the power of motherhood, and West certainly gives his role a nice little twist from what we have come to expect in such films that throw two people together.  But primarily ""The Forgotten"" is a film that wastes several talented performers.  Most of Anthony Edwards scenes are in the trailer, Sinise has to wait most of the film for a scene worthy of his talents, and ""The Forgotten"" is a movie that literally throws away Alfre Woodward.",3,What is forgotten is the great opening story premise,1106611200,"01 25, 2005",2005,4030,"['got', 'really', 'anxious', 'when', 'put', 'DVD', 'Forgotten', 'was', 'given', 'option', 'watching', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'extended', 'version', 'alternate', 'ending', 'Given', 'what', 'knew', '2004', 'film', 'wit', 'mother', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'had', 'son', 'was', 'worried', 'two', 'endings', 'might', 'completely', 'opposite', 'resolutions', 'situation', 'Fortunately', 'not', 'case', 'think', 'alternate', 'ending', 'slightly', 'stronger', 'original', 'actually', 'great', 'extent', 'are', 'pretty', 'compatible', 'proliferation', 'alternative', 'endings', 'DVDs', 'worries', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'movie', 'going', 'end', 'when', 'start', 'making', 'think', 'are', 'serious', 'trouble', 'have', 'horrid', 'visions', 'alternate', 'endings', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Casablanca', 'Forgotten', 'film', 'interesting', 'idea', 'trailer', 'away', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'have', 'doubt', 'way', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'leaning', 'one', 'Telly', 'Paretta', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'been', 'mourning', 'death', '9-year-old', 'son', 'Sam', 'year', 'can', 'do', 'months', 'days', 'hours', 'Sam', 'was', 'killed', 'airplane', 'crash', 'nine', 'other', 'kids', 'Telly', 'seeing', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Munce', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'resisting', 'treatment', 'goal', 'spend', 'less', 'time', 'day', 'looking', 'Sam', 'toys', 'photographs', 'boy', 'Then', 'home', 'one', 'day', 'finds', 'everything', 'gone', 'husband', 'Jim', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'insisting', 'never', 'had', 'child', 'had', 'suffered', 'miscarriage.The', 'idea', 'woman', 'who', 'created', 'fictional', 'child', 'who', 'up', 'getting', 'killed', 'rather', 'compelling', 'even', 'are', 'suddenly', 'thinking', 'Who', 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'not', 'what', 'going', 'here', 'one', 'movies', 'were', 'mom', 'great', 'odds', 'fights', 'child', 'Part', 'problem', 'Forgotten', 'odds', 'Tally', 'fighting', 'might', 'be', 'greatest', 'human', 'history', 'also', 'interesting', 'idea', 'played', 'out', 'such', 'monumental', 'odds', 'point', 'Gerald', 'Di', 'Pego', 'script', 'trying', 'make', 'power', 'mother', 'love', 'bit', 'lost.Tally', 'able', 'enlist', 'couple', 'allies', 'Ash', 'Correll', 'Dominic', 'West', 'ex-hockey', 'player', 'who', 'not', 'remember', 'daughter', 'Telly', 'had', 'Detective', 'Ann', 'Pope', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'who', 'suspicious', 'feds', 'chasing', 'crazy', 'women', 'who', 'hard', 'believe', 'two', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'suffering', 'parallel', 'delusions', 'initial', 'flaw', 'film', 'know', 'Tally', 'not', 'crazy', 'start', 'really', 'believe', 'ambiguity', 'needs', 'be', 'bigger', 'part', 'first', 'act', 'film', 'longer', 'film', 'cuts', 'ways', 'stronger', 'sort', 'story', 'tends', 'be', 'director', 'Joseph', 'Ruben', 'apparently', 'not', 'recognize', 'smart', 'way', 'go.The', 'major', 'flaw', 'film', 'once', 'get', 'THE', 'EXPLANATION', 'what', 'going', 'awe', 'sheer', 'magnitude', 'power', 'magnitude', 'what', 'going', 'mitigated', 'simple', 'question', 'why', 'go', 'bother', 'when', 'think', 'final', 'scene', 'sure', 'bit', 'much', 'statistical', 'aberration', 'even', 'getting', 'whole', 'question', 'how', 'done', 'not', 'explanation', 'would', 'be', 'forthcoming', 'can', 'appreciate', 'idea', '.This', 'too', 'bad', 'not', 'only', 'idea', 'woman', 'inventing', 'fictional', 'child', 'rather', 'interesting', 'Moore', 'anguished', 'performance', 'particular', 'mother', 'capturing', 'pain', 'loss', 'power', 'motherhood', 'West', 'certainly', 'role', 'nice', 'little', 'twist', 'what', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'such', 'films', 'throw', 'two', 'people', 'together', 'primarily', 'Forgotten', 'film', 'several', 'talented', 'performers', 'Most', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'scenes', 'are', 'trailer', 'Sinise', 'wait', 'most', 'film', 'scene', 'worthy', 'talents', 'Forgotten', 'movie', 'literally', 'away', 'Alfre', 'Woodward']",N/A

Telly manages to connect with Ash Cornell, a divorced ex-pro hockey player whose daughter also died in the crash. She helps him reconnect with his erased memories and the two of them go on a quest to find out the truth about their missing children. In the meantime, they're being chased by government agents and it only gets worse. It turns out that it's all an alien experiment and it seems strangely anticlimactic in the end.This is a exquisitely shot film that makes Brooklyn look beautifully melancholy and mysterious. It's nice to see a film that does Brooklyn justice.  But perhaps the underlying (and more interesting) story here is the failure of both Telly and Ash's marriages. It's as if the children's' disappearance is a signal that they need to grow emotionally if they want to continue as parents. Telly's businessman husband is blandly sympathetic and clueless. Telly gave up her editing work to be a mother. She tried to fit herself into a conventional life that she's not really suited for. We learn less about Ash. He started drinking when his memory was erased and he's not an introspective guy. However, his adventure with Telly forces him to start looking beneath the surface of both himself and the world at large.

Right about when the stock spooky piano music started playing on the soundtrack, followed by the panning-in-over-water opening shot.  If the Hollywood thriller formula becomes any more rigid, we will soon be seeing the same exact movie over and over again.  But anyway, basically this is a very long episode of the X files, with Julianne Moore in the role of Scully.  Not bad casting actually.  I mean, Julianne Moore and Scully kind of resemble eachother and are both redheads.

Yeah that's right folks, for tonight's performance the role of Mulder's cell phone will be played by Johnnie Walker Red Label.  But not to worry though.  After much pressure from Julianne ""Scully"" Moore, Lushed-up Mulder takes the bottle to the sink and pours it all down the drain.  I stopped watching at this point, so I did not find out whether these cheap dramatics were followed by a scene of Scully Moore fast asleep while Lush Mulder frequents the local licka sto, as my homies in South Central like to say.  If this was not the ensuing development then either the movie is totally lacking in realism or the audience is treated to a plot line that involves Scully Moore contending with Lush Mulder coming down with the French Fits whilst they are on the lam from the saucer people and the NSA and posssibly also the Lizard Men from Denver Airport and the Rand Corporation and some members of the British Royal Family.

I have to give due to Julianne Moore on making this film actually work - with a different actress, it could have died a death. (Nicole Kidman was originally rumoured to have the lead role, do we really think that would have worked? A bit too Others-ish I think.)The film is based around a very elaborate mind game, which does get a bit confusing after a while, but on a second viewing, you could probably see things starting to happen, which will make more sense as the film carries on. Telly (Julianne) being able to taste coffee, and wanting to know where hers was, despite not having coffee that morning, thinking that she did have a pen in her bag, when she didn't, and thinking her car was parked in one place, when it was parked in another. There's an awful lot that could have come straight out of an X-Files episode, and sometimes it does feel like it should have stayed as an episode, rather than being stretched to a full length movie.There are some fantastic scare moments in this, including people getting snatched off the ground and a car crash scene that works so well, I actually screamed. Thank God I wasn't holding my drink at the time, I believe I would have soaked myself. I got another shock at the end, as Linus Roache, who appears with very little dialogue, actually gave me the fright of my life, as he looked an older version of someone I know. It actually gave me shivers up my spine. (Interesting little fact, all the characters remain in black, apart from their memories, up until the end.)There's a little bit of a romantic subplot thrown in there, which works, but doesn't in a way. It feels wrong to be thrown into this movie, while Telly is desperately trying to figure out what's going on in her life.The film seems to end, and doesn't really end up explaining itself in any way whatsoever. You're left confused, wondering what on earth happened, and especially what happened to the people who were snatched off the ground! Where did they go?If you want a scare, and a curiousity-rousing movie, then go for this.

Volmar,"[2, 3]","A mother (Julianne Moore) who still holds on tightly to the memory of her son, more than a year after he died in a mysterious plane crash, is suddenly unable to find any evidence of him ever existing. When her husband (Anthony Edwards) and her psychiatrist (Gary Sinise) try to convince her that the life and son she remembers are only in her imagination, and suggest she submit to a decisive medical treatment to get rid of her last remaining memories, she runs away to embark on a quest to find out what is really happening and why she's so sure that her memories are real and not something she imagined.She seeks the help of another parent (Dominic West) who's also in her situation. At first he refuses to help her thinking that she's crazy, but when she shows him proof of the daughter he had, who died in the same accident as her son and who up until then he couldn't remember, he decides to help her look for the truth.Just as soon as they set about their search for answers, their problems begin; the NSA is hunting them down, a strange figure (Linus Roache) seems to be following everywhere they go, and anyone who tries to help them, including the only cop who somewhat believes them (Alfre Woodward), is paying a price before long.While the premise of this movie sounds solid and intriguing, aside from a few shocking moments - mainly the result of very nicely executed special effects combined with some excellent acting - this movie just doesn't deliver the necessary suspense to maintain its mystery interesting. As if to compensate, needless and unending complications are introduced, which were probably meant to confuse the viewer and set up the ""shocking truth"" to be revealed at the end - one which is completely obvious after the first 30 minutes of film -, but they only succeed in aimlessly extending the story and ruining the mood for the exploration of the psychology behind the characters. In that same way many relevant key plot points and ideas are inexlicably set aside and, well... forgotten.Overall, this movie is just an interesting premise that deserved to be better scripted and developed for the screen into something a lot more engaging and entertaining than this very weak and undramatic mystery.As for the special features on the DVD, specifically the look behind the scenes and the possibility of viewing the movie as it was theatrically released or with the alternate ending, they only served to make it more obvious to me that the filmmakers didn't know where they were going with this story.You can pass this one up without regrets.--Reviewed by M.

And then when it came out on DVD, ""did you rent The Forgotten?""  Finally, they just bought the CD, propped toothpicks under my eyelids, and made me watch it.Telly (Julianne Moore) and Jim Paretta (Anthony Edwards) and Ash Correll (Dominic West) have lost their children to a mysterious plane crash. Telly is a wreck, but she's trying to get better. She regularly visits a psychologist (Dr. Jack Munce played by Gary Sinise) to help her deal with her son Sam's (Christopher Kovaleski) death.  Ash finds his counseling at the bottom of a bottle.Then one day, all evidence of Sam disappears.  And suddenly, everyone in Telly's life has forgotten she ever had a son.It's a mother's worst nightmare multiplied by a thousand: it's bad enough that Telly loses her son, but her inability to grieve makes her pain all the worse. Convinced she is not insane, Telly tries to convince Ash that he had a daughter who also died in the plane crash.  When she makes some progress, things get weird.It's to the movie's credit that Telly and Ash never sleep together.  This is a character piece, not a popcorn flick. Just in case the guys get bored, I should point out that we do get to see Telly in some decidedly unmatronly underwear.  But that's about as hot as it gets.Things go from bad to worse as NSA agents and a very weird guy that never blinks (Linus Roache) begin stalking the pair.  They finally get a break when they turn the tables on an agent, knock him out, and begin forcefully interrogating him.  When pressed, he finally admits, ""they're listening."" And then...And then...Well you know what happens because you saw the trailer.  Indeed, if you've seen the trailer, you've correctly guessed the big secret behind the entire movie.  And that's a shame, because the movie hangs much of its suspense and terror on that curious plot point.Plot-wise, there are a lot of problems with The Forgotten.  The fact that Ash (an ex-hockey player) and Telly (an editor, if I remember correctly) become these amazing commandos who can put the drop on an NSA agent seems fishy.  That they then become an amazing Good Cop/Bad Cop duo that can wring the truth out of said agent is preposterous.  But then, the movie doesn't invest too much in logic.That's not to say that The Forgotten is boring.  Once the first agent gets sucked up into the heavens, you're always waiting for it to happen again.  Too bad the characters act as if they never witnessed such an event.  I don't know about you, but if I watched the roof get blown off of a cabin and a grown man shoot skyward, I'd be burrowing underground and hiding in subways.  I would NOT 1) stand outside, talking about the insanity of it all, 2) drive in open country, talking about the insanity of it all, 3) run around on beaches, talking about...you get the picture.The movie really hinges on Moore's acting ability, which is in full strength here.  At least, her tear ducts are; it's a rare moment when she's not weeping.  Still, she manages to switch between motherly love, heartbreaking sorrow and parental rage with expression alone.  West makes a great ex-hockey player, but he's a little too conflicted to scratch beneath his surface.  Just about everyone else is window dressing, or worse, mumbles their lines.  That includes Sinise, who really deserves more respect.Joseph Ruben expertly directs the movie, with long floating shots and stalker-cam views.  Almost all of The Forgotten is filmed with a blue lens, and the music is perfectly matched to the mood.

She has a supportive husband (Edwards) and a capable psychologist (Sinise), and is making progress towards acceptance.  Then, suddenly, little things start to happen.  Her car is parked in a different space than where she left it.  A cup of coffee she is drinking disappears.  These events concern her, but it isn't until her son's things start to disappear that she really freaks out.  All of a sudden no one seems to remember her son, although the memories are quite clear to her.  Teaming up with the father of a girl who was killed in the same accident as her son, Telly sets out to figure out just what is going on.  And that is as far as I will go story-wise, because I don't want to give too much away.Moore does a good job as the grieving mother who is determined to get to the bottom of this mystery.  In fact, she gives the stand out performance in this movie.  The special effects, when used are very effective, especially the ""snatching"" effect seen in the previews.  The story is interesting, but fails somewhere along the way to really make sense.  When everything is revealed, it does not entirely support what has gone before, and the ""happy ending"" that is tacked onto the end really makes no sense at all...it just serves as a giant ""reset button"" that seems cheap.  The point of the story is nice though, and that gives it some points in my book.

868507,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B0006IIKQW,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[3, 5]","Everybody wants to be the next M. Night Shyamalan, don't they? It would appear that way with the super-natural thriller genre getting a serious kick in the pants over the past couple of years based on the number of projects, some have worked (The Ring) but for the most part audiences have come away disappointed by the far from quality Shyamalan's films were known for. Now with the now famous director's latest work, The Village, far from meeting fan expectations, could the door be open for a new one to take over now that essentially Shyamalan wants to move on to different projects? Already The Forgotten has labeled itself this year's The Sixth Sense, whether it be the rumors of this being a knock-off of the 1999 hit or studio enthusiasm, so whatever way it goes shouldn't be shocking, just as its finale is.The story for The Forgotten follows a grieving mother as she attempts to track down the truth about her eight year old son who was believed to have died in an airplane tragedy but now appears to have been part of an orchestrated cover up. Telly Paretta, like any parent would be in this situation, has never felt the same way since two years ago when her son Sam was killed in a tragic plane accident the killed five other children on their way to summer camp. Every day, for at least an hour, she slips back into her son's room, looks at old scrapbooks and watches videos of him through his short-lived childhood, thus keeping a part of her son alive - his memory. When she discovers that the videos have been erased and the scrapbooks emptied, she becomes furious at her husband who she claims wants their son forgotten from their life so that they can move on. But her psychiatrist reveals to her that Telly and her husband never had a son, or at least a living one, as she miscarried and nearly died after giving birth to their still born son. He states that it is normal for a woman in this situation to create imaginary children and friends to fill the void that has been lost in their life. Telly refuses to belief this and runs off searching for a man whose daughter was friends with her son before the crash. When he comes to realization that he had a daughter, the two run off together in search of the truth while being constantly pursued by National Security attempting to cover up a conspiracy they don't want dug up. The story for The Forgotten is quite simply one of the most pathetic and miserable scripts created for a feature film, not sent direct to video, this year. To be fair, the first one-third of the film in which Telly is told by her psychiatrist that she may be psychotic, specifically making up a child in her mind to deal with the miscarriage, was an intriguing piece of work and may have kept the interest of audience had the screenwriters followed through with that premise. Unfortunately The Forgotten, much in the same way as another horror rip-off, Godsend, earlier this year, decides to veer so severely off course from reality that you are left with more questions by the end then when you started off.The film has a perfectly assembled cast, , unfortunately all that priceless talent is wasted in this hopeless tripe of a film. Julianne Moore, better known for her brilliant performances in more independent fare like The Shipping News and Far From Heaven, gives tremendous emotion to the character of Telly Paretta, a woman who will do anything just to have her son back in her life. Her specific actions and moods will connect instantly with parents while those not yet blessed with a child in their lives may struggle to accept some of the events occurring but will at least understand them. Dominic West, a rising up and comer in Hollywood, does an exceptional job with the role of man who's practically sent his life down a drunken spiral ever since he lost his daughter in what supposedly a tragic plane accident. Applause must be given to the screenwriters for getting at least one thing right in this script and that was for Moore and West's characters to have an intense relationship together but not have them collapse into yet another pathetic ""romantic"" escapade as in other films of this genre. Alfre Woodard and Anthony Edwards are two support characters that could have easily been down-sized based on their roles in the feature or completely eliminated altogether as they do little, if anything seriously, to the progression of the story. And Gary Sinise, now known as the star of the recently launched CSI: New York series on the C-BS television network, does the best he can with the material that is given to him but unfortunately for him the character is seriously flawed. Without giving too much away, though, to be honest, there's too much confusion to clearly give anything away in this film, Sinise's character knows of the ""experiment"" going on near the end of the film but states he isn't a government agent, just a guy who knows. Then why wasn't he abducted? Is he one of ""them""? What is his specific role in this cover up? These are just a few of the absurdly large amount of unanswered questions poised at the end of this film that may never be answered.Overall, The Forgotten is by no means, in any shape or form, this year's The Sixth Sense, though it does share a trait with another Shymalan film, The Village, namely that the audience feels cheated in part to its cheap thrills but mainly for an ending that feels ripped an old episode of either The Twilight Zone or The X-Files. There will be those out there who want others to believe that this film is a wonderful send up to the classic B-movie science-fiction thrillers of the 1950s but, as illogical as those films were, they never contained plot holes as gigantic as the ones that occupy The Forgotten's premise. How is it that the Telly is the sole obsession of this ""alien life form"" conducting this experiment and not Ash as well? Though it did take a little coaching, he did remember his daughter nearly as well as Telly remembers Sam. Granted he was eventually abducted but still doesn't he get a little credit in all this? Though mothers do share a much closer relationship with their children then do the fathers, which can not be denied, the film's ending is a bit of an insult to fathers who care deeply for their children and would do just as much as the mothers would to protect them. If these ""things"" are able to instantly ""abduct"" human beings, like Alfre Woodard's character, simply for knowing about what is going on then wouldn't it be simpler for them to abduct everyone involved with these children in order to have them forgotten? What are these ""things"" that are supposedly monitoring the planet and conducting experiments on us? Why are they being conducted? For what specific purpose? Why Earth and not some other life-inhabited planet? Even if one ignores the mind-numbing amount of holes presented in the film's sense of logic, though they are pretty hard to ignore once you get down to the bare bones of it, it must be admitted the film's ending, whether it be clich&eacute;d or admirable, is wrapped up too neatly and without any sense of surprise what-so-ever. No matter how you dress it up, The Forgotten is yet another disaster in the area of science-fiction thrillers this year joining the ranks of Godsend and The Village on the trash-heap of the box

This tragic event takes on an extra level of grimness when all records of her son begin to disappear:  except for her, no one remembers him, and photos, newspaper articles and other documents no longer prove his existence.  Either Moore is crazy or something sinister is going on, and when shadowy government figures get involved, we know it's the latter.In theory, this could be a good movie, but the story is executed so poorly that its potential quality remains a mere hypothetical.  Perhaps the most grating moment comes around a third of the way through the movie, when Moore visits a man who is the father of another child who died, but who cannot remember his daughter.  Fortunately, the power responsible for these existence-erasings - a force powerful and intelligent enough to alter minds and documents - just bothered to poorly wallpaper over the girl's room, allowing Moore to expose the conspiracy.There are other laughable idiocies: the government agents who have no idea how to arrest a person, allowing chases that could have been avoided if they were semi-competent; the police detective who - with little real evidence - easily believes Moore's tale of conspiracy; and so on.  Rather than relying on cleverness to move the story along, this movie uses dumbness.  In a comedy, this might work, but not in this humorless horror movie.

Of course, as the movie departs further and further from any kind of internal logic or coherence, this idea sinks into the vast sea of stupidity.Add to that that the aliens make people disappear in a way that looks silly and cartoonish, rather than spooky, a score that repeats like a bad jingle until you want to throttle someone, photography so unrelievedly dark that on TV about half of the film is just black, and this one is not even worth the few dollars I paid to see it.

At first they seem happy and are doing the right thing. Then, all of a sudden, they start to spiral out of control until they finally meet their untimely demise. Joseph Ruben's direction starts out tight and effective, but loosens and loses steam as the film wears on. The problem is, the film isn't even that long, so there's not a lot of room for error at all.

The climax of the film takes such a left turn that it makes the sudden change in From Dusk Till Dawn look like a random scene from The Straight Story. It's not that you're not expecting what ultimately happens, because it's actually pretty obvious if you pay attention. It's the way they go about giving you the payoff that dooms the movie.

I knew it had something to do with people getting sucked into the air and kids disappearing, and that's all I cared to know. I figured it was just another crappy Hollywood 'horror' movie where the little kids are in trouble and their parents have to save them. Well, I guess that's the case with this movie, but it makes it work.Now, I certaintly didn't expect the cause of the children's disappreances to be what it was, but that's what makes this movie great-the suspense and of course the suprises. At least twice in this movie EVERYONE in the theater jumped out of their chairs.This movie takes the ""Signs"" effect, if you will. You don't actually see the monster and/or evil doer until the end of the film. The movie is about a woman who has lost her son, Sam. Every single day she looks at her son's pictures and watches tapes of him, and ever day she sees a shrink who tries to help her cope with her ""loss"". That is, until the movies and photographs start missing and her doctor and husband have to tell her that she never had a son, though she did have a premature baby and ever since then she has created an ""altered reality"" or sorts in which she makes up a whole new son in her mind that never existed. Now, she's not going to believe this. She runs out of the house and basically hides away until she runs into a man who's ""daughter"" used to hang out with her ""son"". She recognizes him, but he doesn't recognize her. She tells him about what's happened to her, and he doesn't believe her, until she has to tear down his wall, revealing another wall behind it full of crayon-drawings his daughter drew. Then the two realize they have to work together to find their children.One aspect about this film is the ending. While the ending does leave you feeling happy, it's just too Hollywood. Everything turns out super happily for everyone. But still, it's a good movie. A GOOD movie. Not a revolutionary movie. It's not ""The Gotfather"". A lot of people have been juding movies too harsly. If there's one unbelievable thing about it, it sucks. If it's not the most original movie ever, it sucks. People need to just watch a movie and see if they enjoy it. If they see a comedy movie and it doesn't make them laugh, then it sucks. If they see a horror movie it's not scary, then it sucks. I like movies because anything can happen in them-after all, if I wanted to see possible, every day things I'd just go outside.

She laters links up with a friend who forgets that he had a girl named Lauren who used to play with her son named Sam. He remembers later and what ensues is some test run by the government to erase the memories of those people whose kids died in that plane crash.Opinion: This movie had potential but the plotholes, lousy script and the asinine twist kill whatever chance this movie had to be great. If they would have kept the movie simple it could have been okay. The story of the government running a test that erases memory seemed interesting enough until the movie threw supernaturalism into the mix. Julianne Moore is not bad in this movie but there is little she could do to save it. Alfre Woodard is a great actress but even she seems out of place in this suspense-turned-sci-fi flick. You want me to believe that a government agent can absorb bullets like T-1000 in Terminator 2? Talk about ripping pages out of X-Files! There are other moments when your intelligence is insulted like when Alfre Woodard's character gets sucked into thin air or when they hit an agent at a car rental place who manages to get up afterwards or their car getting hit by an SUV driven by those insufferable agents and they still manage to get away without a scratch. In short this movie is a mess that could have been avoided. If kept simple it could have worked but when they throw aliens into the mix, they turned what could have been a decent movie into a foolish parody of X-Files and the Twilight Zone.

868523,AIDQV95MLCIDD,B0006IIKQW,P. Luce,"[2, 3]","The Forgotten is a movie that leaves you wanting it to answer more rather than wanting to forget that you paid to see it. The plot keeps you wondering what is going on for a while and then how they are going to solve it. The problem is that they don't solve it. The ending just kind of quickly wraps things up and leaves you feeling a little ripped off like the ending of Close Encounters of the Third Kind. I wish they would have gone more into the reason behind why the characters were forgetting their children. Like The Village, this movie's previews made it look ""nail biting intense"" but it kind of lets you down in that department. There are a couple of cool scenes that make you blink, but other than that you won't be checking around the room or afraid to watch the movie with the lights off. It claims to be the ""biggest jaw-dropper since the Sixth Sense,"" but that must be a different movie than the one I watched. The dvd has an alternate director's cut ending, but it is actually worse than the theatrical one. Moore and West do a good job of getting you on their side of trying to solve this mystery and the plot leaves you wondering what if, but not for very long. Sinise is miscasted because you know there is something up with him just because of the type of characters he plays and the NSA agents make you feel like your watching a two hour version of the X-Files. It is worth watching, but also worth forgetting if you pardon my pun.

However, I feel my luck turned out well by viewing this movie on DVD, where I could see two versions of the film with alternate (but similar) endings. After watching the movie, I found it be an average thriller which starts off great, but ends somewhat abruptly.The story starts off with Telly Paretta (Julianne Moore), watching video tapes of her son, Sam (who is killed in a plane crash), and viewing various photo albums of him. One day, she sees the tapes erased, their photos missing, and she blames her husband for it. Surprisingly, her husband, therapist and neighbor don't seem to remember her son, and believe that she has invented him in her mind, as an alternate life. She meets her friend Ash, whose daughter used to play with her son, but he doesn't seem to remember even having a child himself. However, she finds a clue at his house, convincing him that he did have a daughter, and makes him remember. Together, Ash and Telly start a search as to what conspiracy is taking place and how they can get their children back.Julianne Moore acted really well as Telly Paretta, as did the rest of the cast. The story is fast paced, with a lot of surprises that makes you jump off your seat. The plot of the movie is pretty good throughout, except the ending. For instance, the movie keeps proceeding gradually, keeping you guessing for most of the time, which is good. However, the downside is that, during the last 10 minutes of the movie, they suddenly speed things up, in account to explain everything. Furthermore, after the movie gets over, you are still baffled with many questions as to what the purpose of the experiments were, how long they were going on, and (if they were going on for a long time) what made Telly so special to remember her son, while other mothers seemed to forget?All in all, I am glad that I saw this movie on DVD rather than seeing it in the theatre, as I would have felt a little disappointed in spending a lot of money, just to get confused.",4,Can be easily Forgotten...,1110499200,"03 11, 2005",2005,2040,"['did', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'movie', 'theatre', 'However', 'feel', 'luck', 'turned', 'out', 'well', 'viewing', 'movie', 'DVD', 'where', 'could', 'see', 'two', 'versions', 'film', 'alternate', 'similar', 'endings', 'watching', 'movie', 'found', 'be', 'average', 'thriller', 'great', 'somewhat', 'abruptly.The', 'story', 'Telly', 'Paretta', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'watching', 'video', 'tapes', 'son', 'Sam', 'who', 'killed', 'plane', 'crash', 'viewing', 'various', 'photo', 'albums', 'One', 'day', 'tapes', 'erased', 'photos', 'missing', 'husband', 'Surprisingly', 'husband', 'therapist', 'neighbor', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'remember', 'son', 'believe', 'invented', 'mind', 'alternate', 'life', 'friend', 'Ash', 'daughter', 'used', 'play', 'son', ""n't"", 'seem', 'remember', 'even', 'having', 'child', 'However', 'clue', 'house', 'convincing', 'did', 'have', 'daughter', 'remember', 'Together', 'Ash', 'Telly', 'start', 'search', 'what', 'conspiracy', 'taking', 'place', 'how', 'can', 'get', 'children', 'Moore', 'acted', 'really', 'well', 'Telly', 'Paretta', 'did', 'rest', 'cast', 'story', 'fast', 'paced', 'lot', 'surprises', 'jump', 'off', 'seat', 'plot', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'ending', 'instance', 'movie', 'proceeding', 'gradually', 'keeping', 'guessing', 'most', 'time', 'good', 'However', 'downside', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'suddenly', 'speed', 'things', 'up', 'account', 'explain', 'everything', 'Furthermore', 'movie', 'over', 'are', 'still', 'baffled', 'many', 'questions', 'what', 'purpose', 'experiments', 'were', 'how', 'long', 'were', 'going', 'were', 'going', 'long', 'time', 'what', 'made', 'Telly', 'so', 'special', 'remember', 'son', 'other', 'mothers', 'seemed', 'forget', 'am', 'glad', 'saw', 'movie', 'DVD', 'rather', 'seeing', 'theatre', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'little', 'disappointed', 'spending', 'lot', 'money', 'just', 'get', 'confused']",N/A

The trailers made it look like it was going to be a fun, turn-your-brain-off suspense thriller with aliens capable of ripping roofs off houses. I dig it.The problem is that about halfway through it got ludicrous, and no roofs had been ripped off yet. (Except in the trailer, which committed the unpardonable sin of showing scenes from way, way farther in the movie than it should have.) After that, it just kept getting more and more ludicrous. I kept watching, though to be honest I'm not quite sure why, right up until the end. I was writing the review in my head while watching, a horrible vice of mine, and I was saying ""ludicrous, but watchable."" Then came the end, and my skull went ""OMGWTFBBQWORSTENDINGEVAR!!1!!~!1!"" Once my head cleared, I realized it wasn't, in fact, the worst ending in film history (and had, oddly, not a thing to do with barbecuing-- all films should end with a big barbecue, the world would be a much happier place if they did. But I digress.), but man, it was a stinker. Had they cut off the movie five minutes before they did, it would be ludicrous but watchable. Tacking on the final scene made it ludicrous and just plain bad.Telly (Julianne Moore, who needs no introduction) lost her son Sam (Mind the Gap's Christopher Kovaleski) in an airplane crash fourteen months before the story begins. She is still obsessed over his death, and her husband Jim (ER's Anthony Edwards) and her therapist, Dr. Munce (The Stand's Gary Sinise), are trying to convince her. Then, out of nowhere, something odd happens-- all the pictures and video of Sam vanish. Jim and Munce, realizing the gig is up, inform Telly that, in fact, she never had a son; the whole thing is in her head. She thinks she's going nuts until she runs into Ash (Chicago's Dominic West), whose daughter Lauren was killed in the same crash as Sam.All the pieces are there for a good psychological thriller. A good conspiracy film. Even a good film about alien abduction. (I know, there's never been such a beast, but there's always a first time.) This, however, is not it. It goes for all the predictable plot twists, adds car chases wherever possible, and goes for the ambiguous-yet-sappy ending that Hollywood so loves, but manages to not satisfy a single filmgoer with half a brain.

Or was he?  Despite the fact that she has pictures, videotapes and her own memories of the child, we begin to suspect that he might never have existed at all and that she is suffering from a psychotic delusion brought on by a miscarriage years earlier.  The plot becomes more complicated when she meets up with a man whose own daughter may have also perished in the same alleged accident.  Together they search for answers as to why no record remains of their children ever having existed.Despite having some talented performers in the cast, ""The Forgotten"" is a gimmicky thriller that telegraphs its solution early on.  Even Moore - who seems to be slumming a bit after all her work in high-toned features over the past several years (""Far From Heaven,"" ""The Hours"" etc.) - can't overcome all the paranoid-thriller cliches that come to dominate the screenplay:  the couple on the run from nameless terrors, the sympathetic and credulous investigator, the subsidiary characters who may be part of an elaborately worked out conspiracy and hoax.

Boy, was that a mistake. I walked away feeling like I'd wasted so much of my brain potential on an undeveloped, poorly written movie. My biggest gripes:1. Julianne Moore's character. I had a problem with the fact that she seemed to be the ONLY one who would not forget that she had a child. Why wouldn't she forget? Did she love her child more than any of the other parents who did forget, including her husband? What was the issue?2. The Aliens were conducting this experiment (possibly for years) and one incident disrupts it, and boom..the experiment is over! So based on one woman, what the Aliens have learned is ..""the bond between parent and child cannot be forgotten""? And testing is kaput, from one failed case?3. We know that the children come back in the end, but what about those such as Alfre Woodard? Does she come back as well? At what about the children besides Julianne's and the other character with the daughter? If the experiment failed, and their children are returned, are the other children besides theirs returned as well? The film never explained.

As time passes, parts of her memory conflict with the appearant reality around her...before long, she is convinced that her memory is accurate and that everyone else around her is delusional.If the movie had stopped establishing plot right here and played out the argument of her sanity, I think they coudl have made a really interesting movie.

Jordan ""virginia reader""","[1, 1]","The true test of whether or not to buy a DVD is whether or not you will watch the film three times within the next three years.  The Forgotten is one of those movies that is definitely worth a second viewing, but I'm on the fence about whether or not it would pass the 3x3 rule.First, Julianne Moore as Telly does a great job.  Because of the snowstorms recently, we've been socked in the house and have had a chance to see the Village, Cellular, and the Forgotten in pretty short order.  I'm rating the Village a little higher than the Forgotten, and the Forgotten a little bit better than Cellular, but of all of the acting performances, Julianne does the best job.  She carries this movie. She has this ineffable, compelling quality about her grief and determination that you don't really appreciate until you see an over the top histrionic performance like the one Kim Basinger gave in Cellular to compare it to.Second, the pacing is better than Cellular.  There are three ""jolt"" moments in the Forgotten that are very well-done, and the first third of the movie is particularly compelling, even though a lot of it is about Telly locked in her thoughts and consumed by her grief for her child.  Cellular wasn't badly done, it's just that they went for comic side beats every now and then instead of opting to sustain the tension (and focus).This is a movie about the power of a mother's love, and this is going to be terrifically appealing on a thematic and emotional basis for some folks.  That being said, some men may not be as enthralled by it, because quite frankly, the male actors weren't operating at as high a level as Ms. Moore, there's an awful lot of pointless running in this movie, and the end is weak (I won't spoil it, but the end leaves a lot to be desired).Its qualities surpass its defects.

It's a good-looking, well-crafted movie of course, with a wonderful cast and a delicious premise, but it's let down by the screenplay.  About on par with a reasonable episode of ""The X-Files"", Gerald Di Pego's tale of abducted children and their seemingly delusional parents falls too quickly into the repetitive pattern of a chase movie and never really makes the most of the potential for ambiguity at its core.  There's nothing clever about it, nothing that throws you off.  Nor, once all is revealed, does it sufficiently explain how the aliens managed to do what they did, or when, or why.  I presume we're meant to forget about that as our eyes well up over scenes of familial reunion.  Whatever.  This could have been a wonderful story about the psychology of grief or a creepy sci-fi thriller.  In the end, it manages to be neither - trivializing one for the sake of the other.

A good suspense movie, an original idea; one thinks...but no, don't get your hopes up yet. There is aboslutely no point to this film. Since the audience lands smack-dab in the middle of the story line (which isn't too solid in itself) we have no idea who any of these people are, much less care. There is absolutely no character development for any of the characters and no background information to any of their lives before this strange plane crash occurs.The original idea of the film offers so many possibilities for where it can take us, unfortunately The film moves in quite possibly the only direction it couldn't go. Not to mention Juilanne Moore cries in every scene. I for one, felt no pity for her, we never got to know her, how can we be expected care? I just wished she would stop her over exaggerated whimpering.I happen to love Gary Sinise, and he can do no wrong when it comes to acting, as far as I'm concerned, that's why I blame Director Joesph Ruben, he obviously forgot to play the film back after editing, if he had he might have noticed one important fact: none of it makes any freakin sense!! Another otherwise original idea ruined by poor direction and overall stupidity, when will it end!?The film brings about numerous questions, none of which are answered by the conclusion. I have no idea what this film is about! Some are calling it ""An Alien Thriller"" those people need to see it again (unfortunately for them). There was no mention of aliens in the film at all, not even a allusion to the fact that they may exsist.

Coles ""book group moderator""","[7, 8]","Summary: an ultimately ludicrous and forgettable thriller about a woman who can't forget her son who died in a plane crash and who then discovers a terrifying secret when those around her mysteriously begin to deny he ever existed.Longer and with spoilers: Julianne Moore lost her son over a year ago, but takes a moment each day to sift through his old belongings, view him on old videotape and otherwise recall the last day that she saw him before he boarded the doomed plane.  Her unwillingness to let go has taken a significant toll on her marriage, but her husband has stood by her and supported her care under a psychiatrist (played with appropriate reserve by Gary Sinise).  The movie is at its most compelling in these early moments when the premise is just about a woman mourning the loss of a loved one.  When an old family photograph that she cherished morphs into one of just her and her husband, the movie remains interesting because the audience -- like our heroine -- believes that the husband may be removing the child from her life as part of his own recovery (i.e. enough mourning, I'm getting rid of his photos from the common space).  The plot thickens, however, when it's not just one photograph and the husband, the neighbor and even the newspaper accounts of the plane crash do not acknowledge that he ever existed.  Her psychiatrist, at that point, solemnly states that she had never had a son.  Rather, she is suffering from an extreme case of post-traumatic stress disorder on the heels of a miscarriage, and has totally created a child and family life that never existed.  When she goes to pull out an old photograph to support her claim, well, of course her son isn't there.  Unfortunately, the film takes an extreme nose dive from that point.  Suddenly, there's the father of another child whose running with her, another man who seems to be everywhere at once and creepily silent, some secret agent dudes who exude bad intentions (without any reason), and a good cop who ""believes"" Julianne's version of the truth.  And that truth?  A dingo ate her baby!  Okay, actually it was aliens.  Aliens took her son and it was part of their grand experiment to see how long before people forget the deaths of loved ones.  It turns out that some mothers just refuse to let go.I really wanted to like this movie, but as people were literally snatched into the air by the Bad Aliens, they also ripped out any hopes I had for the film.

What if you were told that every moment you experienced and every memory you held dear never happened? In Revolution Studios' haunting psychological thriller The Forgotten, Telly Paretta (Julianne Moore) is tormented by the memory of her eight-year-old son Sam's death in a plane crash 14 months ago. While trying to work through her grief, and her subsequent estrangement from her husband Jim (Anthony Edwards), she is informed by her psychiatrist, Dr. Munce (Gary Sinise), that she is suffering from delusions, that her son never existed and she is fabricating his memories. Stunned, she tries to find evidence of Sam's existence photos, videos, scrapbooks. But it has all disappeared. Telly is convinced she is going mad until she meets Ash Correll the father of one of the other plane crash victims. Together, they embark on a search to prove the existence of their children and reclaim their sanity. So what's the problem? The premise grows too ridiculous to take seriously.

So, even if the film's conclusion is much, much incredible, and there are so many discrepancies among the logics of the story, her first-rate acting carries the whole film to the end.  Well, almost, I mean.What kind of consipacy?  Sorry that my summery is nothing but a very vague one.  I cannot tell you anything except that Julianne Moore is Telly Paretta, whose son, it is told in flashbacks, is no longer with her, because of one recent incident.  Traumatized Telly, however, is informed that what she believes is true, is not actually true -- in short, her memories are the results of her mind that might have manufuctured its own.  But are they?So?  The first act of this ""psychological thriller"" is gripping, with Julianne Moore's teriffic acting.  Anthony Edwards (as Telly's husband), Gary Sinise (as Telly's doctor), Dominique West, Alfre Woodard, and Linus Roache also appear, and among them Dominique West is as great as Moore, whose character gives an unexpected clue to the truths.[FROM THE DIRECTOR OF 'THE GOOD SON'] In my book, director Joseph Ruben is a guy who gave us the silly 'shockers' with guilty pleasure, like Julia Roberts's 'Sleeping with the Enemy' and Elijah Wood's 'The Good Son.'  Like these thrillers, you just cannot take 'Forgotten' seriously.  The film is successful in giving some 'surprises' and 'shocks,' but they are largely crude, unsophisticated, but fairly effective ones.  Like, something suddenly jumping up into the sky.Enjoy this film only as 'thriller' and don't ask what kind of thriller.  Otherwise, you will be disappointed at the second half of the story, which, I am afraid, sounds too ridiculous to some people, who didn't expect this kind of story development.  My complaint is not that.  I think the film ends in a typical Hollywood style, which should be remedied.  Alternate ending is welcomed.'Forgotten' is not a classic, but still an entertaining conspiracy thriller, supported greatly by the presence of Julianne Moore.

868561,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0006IIKQW,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","THE FORGOTTEN opens with a high camera angle sweeping over a body of water that appears like a frosted glass window as the opening credits scatter by. Quickly moving from the rippling water to the speckled land dotted with glass-filled skyscrapers, the opening scene suggests that in THE FORGOTTEN things aren't quite what they appear to be, foreshadowing the possibility that perhaps we are being watched, seeing ourselves but as a poor reflection in a mirror. With such a symbolic opening, the audience is misled to believe that THE FORGOTTEN is a movie filled with substance and importance or a great achievement in cinematic art. Unfortunately, THE FORGOTTEN is none of these. Instead, it's a twisted mix between a psychological thriller and a cheap science fiction flick that seems more like a bad episode of The X-Files rather than a full length motion picture.THE FORGOTTEN stars Julianne Moore as Telly Paretta, a mother still mourning over the accidental death of her eight-year-old son, Sam, nearly a year and a half after he was killed in a plane crash. Since the tragic death, Telly has withdrawn from the world. She no longer meets with her friends and her marriage to Jim (Anthony Edwards) is strained to the point of collapse. Dr. Jack Munce (Gary Sinise) has been trying to help her work through her pain and overcome her grief. After a fixing a quiet dinner at home with Jim, making a self-deprecating joke, and revealing that she has decided to return to her editing job it appears that Telly's life is making a turnaround. But like Alice in Wonderland, Telly is actually on the edge of a rabbit hole leading to the unbelievable.It starts with simple things. She forgets where she parks her car. While talking with Dr. Munce she thinks she was drinking a cup of coffee when apparently she really wasn't. When she returns home she discovers that all the pictures of Sam (placed strategically throughout the house so she would never forget) have been replaced. While editing a new book, Telly begins her daily ritual of relaxation of feeling Sam's hat, sniffing his glove, and looking through family pictures. But to her horror she discovers there are no pictures. Instead of the warm and peaceful gaze of the child she has lost, she is greeted with the cold and white gaze of empty pages from a photo album. Dr. Munce and Jim tell her Sam never existed and for the past nine years she has been delusional. Telly runs away and sets forth to prove her sanity. She meets up with the father of one of Sam's friends, Ash Correll (Dominic West), and after a night of mental and emotional turmoil, the two join forces to discover the truth. What that truth is, I can't really say without giving away the ending. However, like Fox Mulder used to say in The X-Files, &#34;The truth is out there.&#34;The central core of the movie revolves around Telly's love for Sam. There are some who would argue that the theme of the movie runs deeper than that, suggesting that THE FORGOTTEN is a cleverly crafted political movie against abortion disguised as a psychological sci-fi thriller or that the movie is a brilliantly choreographed piece of feminist cinema clearly illustrating that women are better people than men. Though there are slight elements in the film that could lead one to believe such an interpretation they are so miniscule that such analysis of the film is reading too much into something that's not really there. THE FORGOTTEN is a psychological sci-fi thriller revolving around a mother's love for her son. No more. No less.Director Joseph Ruben has directed a handful of films (including the fairly successful SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY and MONEY TRAIN), but has received very little recognition. Bringing together a diverse and talented cast to star in a weak psychological sci-fi thriller while keeping their performances believable is not an easy task and Ruben did a fine job. There are also some interesting special effects that Ruben was able to maximize as much as possible given the limited material. He was assisted by cinematographer Anastas N. Michos (MONA LISA SMILE, MAN ON THE MOON). Michos' cameras are often carefully hidden behind staircase railings and park bushes, perfectly capturing the suspenseful and voyeuristic tone begun in the opening credits.The acting in the movie is somewhat impressive. Julianne Moore has become a powerhouse performer over the last several years. Her very presence in a picture makes even the most pointless movies (EVOLUTION for example) not only bearable, but somewhat enjoyable and her talent shines through in THE FORGOTTEN. Grieving mothers aren't easy to portray and actresses usually either give a melodramatic, maniacal, over-the-top performance or an interpretation so full of sappy sadness that it could bring a tear to an undertaker. Moore steers away from both of those extremes and instead, beautifully captures all the nuances of a grief-stricken mother fighting against the world in a very realistic and believable manner. Moore is the thread that holds the movie together and without her the movie would be totally forgettable.Dominic West is just as believable as a father caught in a raging battle with alcoholism that threatens to steal him of his most precious and happy memories. West is an underrated actor who despite a few memorable minor roles (Bill Dunbar in MONA LISA SMILE, Fred Casely in CHICAGO) really hasn't been noticed by the Hollywood establishment. THE FORGOTTEN could turn out to be the movie that makes his career.Gary Sinise also stars in THE FORGOTTEN. Like Moore, Sinise can make almost any film better by just acting in it. Though, his presence as psychologist Dr. Munce does lend the film some credibility, Sinise's performance turns out to be nothing more than an excuse to bring home a paycheck.The failure to capitalize on Sinise's talent doesn't lie with director Ruben. Instead, the fault lies with writer Gerald Di Pego. Ruben maximizes Sinise talent as much as possible with the material given. However, Sinise doesn't do much because his character is a meant to be nothing more than a plot device. The movie works in much the same way. The carefully constructed universe of the first half of the film proves to be nothing more than a carefully constructed gimmick that leaves the audience feeling cheated once they find out what's really going on.The unraveling begins about halfway through the movie. Ash and Telly are driving away in their getaway vehicle. Telly tells Ash that she doesn't watch tv and reads instead. Then, in one of the most memorable and well shot scenes in the movie, a black government SUV appears out of nowhere and crashes into Ash and Telly. One world crashes into another and all that is left is a tangled mess filled with conspiracy theories, people getting sucked into the sky, and a jumbled message about the power of a mother's love. The movie tries to put all the pieces together into a coherent whole, but fails miserably. The finished product is filled with holes and by the end of the movie a person leaves the theatre thinking that, like Telly, maybe they should have read a book instead.",3,Watchers in the

868562,A38TC59GM2WW1X,B0006IIKQW,"Victor Chen ""Messerschmitts""","[4, 8]","Wow.  That's what I said as I steped out of the theatre.  This is one of those films which just makes you think to yourself, ""now that was a really COOL movie!"".  The previews for ""the Forgotten"" entice you with the irresistible premise of a mother who's being told that her dead son is just a figment of her imagination.  However, one of her son's friend who also died in same accident has a father who also remembers.  I went into the movie thinking, ""this movie can't possibly be as interesting as the previews make it out to be, there's gotta be some big let-down at the end!""  I was pleasantly surprised:  this movie is just as good as the previews would have you believe.I am continually impressed with veteran actress Julianne Moore, who at age 46(?) not only looks beautiful, but consistently produces high-caliber performances.  Moore has, in my humble opinion never really produced a ""bad"" movie.  She has impeccable taste in choosing scripts (okay fine, we'll forget about Evolution, but even that movie was kinda fun).  This movie has a lot of mindbenders and suspense, but at the heart of the story is the love of a mother for her son.  Bravo to the filmmakers for casting Moore, who vividly portrayed the anguish and Odyssey-esque emotional journey of her character (whose name is Telly).However, much as I love to rave about performances in general, and Moore's performance in particular, I must admit that the plot and storytelling in this film was so strong that an actress half as competent as Moore could have made this a fairly decent movie.  I cannot BELIEVE how some reviewers (both professional and on Amazon) are saying that ""the Forgotten"" is like a ""bad episode of the X Files"".  This was clearly a GOOD episode of the X files!  ""The Forgotten"" grabs you and doesn't let go from the very first frame, playing with the audience' preconceptions and their logic.  The tension and supsense of the movie continues to build slowly and methodically in crescendo, never revealing too much.  Like a slowly-released drug, the film jealously guards its secrets, inticing the audience with just enough insight to make you salivate for the next revelation until the unbelieveable ending.  The audience begins its journey alongside Moore thinking ""No, it couldn't be!  It just couldn't!"", but the film continues to suprise and amaze you until like Telly (Moore), you no longer know quite what to expect.I truly believe this film thrives due to the minimalist philosophy of its storytelling.  There are some utterly thrilling and surpising moments (which I won't spoil for you by suggesting what they might be), but they are not done gratuitously.  But I do recommend you sit close to the screen for maximum thrill effect.  These ""OMG-moments"" are just exciting enough to keep you on your toes, and to progress the story.  M. Night Shyamalan, another filmmaker whom I greatly admire, also kept to a minimalist approach to storytelling.  It worked well for him in his film ""Signs"" until the very end, in which we discover that ""more is not better""; revealing and showing too much to the audience destroys the mystique of the film, especially when it cannot be done well.  ""The Forgotten"" is a very similar film in style whose ending escapes this common pitfall of suspense/mystery films.  There is enough for a very satisfying ending, but not enough to destory the mystique that has been woven into the audience' mind.  The ending is perhaps slightly mushy and sugarcoated compared to the general feel of the majority of the movie (I am particularly picky about demanding a coherent tone throughout a movie), and perhaps if I made the film I would have made a more poignant and bittersweet conclusion.  However this is really a minor point and I'm just nitpicking.All in all, ""the Forgotten"" should be a thrilling experience for those who like to be surprised.  Watch carefully, and bring your brain.",5,"4.5 stars; ""I believe you Telly!

868563,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0006IIKQW,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[9, 9]","What if everything you knew began to slip away like a fading memory? The premise of The Forgotten seems like its out of The X-Files territory. Telly Paretta (Julianne Moore) is in therapy trying to come to grips with the loss of her 9 year old son in a plane crash. Fourteen months have passed and she still feels his presence vividly expecting him to walk through the door. While visiting her therapist (Gary Sinise) she discusses her sense of loss and her inability to move on. Later, she discusses her son again and he tells her she never had one.They never discussed him. That she's having a delusion and creating an imaginary son to help her deal with other issues. When she discusses this with her husband (Anthony Edwards) he echoes her psychiatrist; they never had a son. Suddenly, photos that she was familiar with featuring her son begin disappearing replaced with others featuring only her and the husband.Then how can her memories be so vivid? How can she still smell his hair, remember the texture of his skin, the color of his eyes, the day he first walked? How can she create a life that never was? There's no evidence he existed even the photos that she looked at the day before that had the three of them together now shows only Telly and her husband. Telly's conviction carries her on a search for her son that she knows in her heart exists. Telly discovers a series of frightening truths along this journey and that she doesn't need to take the journey alone.A disturbing suspense thriller that takes a number of unexpected twists and turns, The Forgotten has something that most thrillers lack-heart and soul. Julianne Moore's powerful performance anchors even the most incredible scenes in the movie. It's her performance that holds the film together even as it threatens to fly apart. With a strong, memorable supporting cast The Forgotten will stay with you as will the questions that it asks. If you're looking for a clearer solution to the story's mystery, I'd suggest watching the extended version that didn't play in theaters. It paints the conclusion with more solid colors although there's much that isn't explained. That's just as well as the best suspense thrillers always leave some loose ends. For those who want a  conclusion that's less clear cut, I'd suggest watching the theatrical cut. Both have their merits and both work extremely well but the inclusion of a couple of scenes might make the difference between accepting the conclusion of the film or not.As I mentioned previously the DVD sports two versions of the film and the extended cut with the alternate ending provides a great extra for fans that want to experience a slightly different version of the film. The extended ending really consists of one sequence that pushes home the conclusion of the film a bit more aggressively and leaves the conclusion a bit less nebulous than the theatrical cut. Both versions have their merits. We also get a short documentary on the making of the film beginning with the germ of the idea and how it occurred to writer Gerald DiPego and how he developed it to the involvement of Julianne Moore and director Joseph Ruben. Many of the behind-the-scenes production talent appear in this documentary discussing the development of the project. The featurette on the making of the film provides glimpses behind-the-scenes on the making of the film with sound bites featuring the main cast discussing their roles and what attracted them to the project in the first place. Both are done exceptionally well and make up for a lack of additional extras on the optical effects used for the film. We also get deleted scenes many of which did not end up in either version of the film.A gripping thriller that will have you guessing about the fate of the various characters in the film The Forgotten isn't likely to be a memory that'll fade away like an old photograph. The rich performances particularly by Julianne Moore, Gary Sinise, Anthony Edwards, Dominic West and Alfre Woodard ground the film in a sense of reality just as Telly's world appears to depart from it. Well directed with an intelligent script that doesn't take any short cuts, The Forgotten will linger with you like the memory of your first date or seeing the first steps your child takes. Some things can't be forgotten or taken away and the rich themes at the heart of this film will make that very clear. If you're someone looking for clear cut resolutions, you may want to watch the extended version and rent before buying. If it appeals to you, I guarantee you'll come back to it again and again. That might make it a worthwhile purchase for you.",4,Intense psychological thriller with some nice twists,1106092800,"01 19, 2005",2005,4641,"['What', 'everything', 'knew', 'began', 'slip', 'away', 'fading', 'memory', 'premise', 'Forgotten', 'X-Files', 'territory', 'Telly', 'Paretta', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'therapy', 'trying', 'come', 'grips', 'loss', '9', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'plane', 'crash', 'Fourteen', 'months', 'have', 'passed', 'still', 'presence', 'vividly', 'expecting', 'walk', 'door', 'visiting', 'therapist', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'sense', 'loss', 'inability', 'move', 'Later', 'son', 'again', 'never', 'had', 'one.They', 'never', 'discussed', 'having', 'delusion', 'creating', 'imaginary', 'son', 'help', 'deal', 'other', 'issues', 'When', 'husband', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'psychiatrist', 'never', 'had', 'son', 'Suddenly', 'photos', 'was', 'familiar', 'featuring', 'son', 'begin', 'disappearing', 'replaced', 'others', 'featuring', 'only', 'husband.Then', 'how', 'can', 'memories', 'be', 'so', 'vivid', 'How', 'can', 'still', 'smell', 'hair', 'remember', 'texture', 'skin', 'color', 'eyes', 'day', 'first', 'walked', 'How', 'can', 'create', 'life', 'never', 'was', 'evidence', 'existed', 'even', 'photos', 'looked', 'day', 'had', 'three', 'together', 'now', 'only', 'Telly', 'husband', 'Telly', 'conviction', 'search', 'son', 'heart', 'Telly', 'series', 'frightening', 'truths', 'journey', ""n't"", 'need', 'take', 'journey', 'alone.A', 'disturbing', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'number', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'turns', 'Forgotten', 'something', 'most', 'thrillers', 'lack-heart', 'soul', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'powerful', 'performance', 'anchors', 'even', 'most', 'incredible', 'scenes', 'movie', 'performance', 'film', 'together', 'even', 'fly', 'apart', 'strong', 'memorable', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Forgotten', 'will', 'stay', 'will', 'questions', ""'re"", 'looking', 'clearer', 'solution', 'story', 'mystery', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'watching', 'extended', 'version', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'theaters', 'conclusion', 'more', 'solid', 'colors', 'much', ""n't"", 'explained', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'best', 'suspense', 'thrillers', 'always', 'leave', 'loose', 'ends', 'who', 'want', 'conclusion', 'less', 'clear', 'cut', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'watching', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'have', 'merits', 'work', 'extremely', 'well', 'inclusion', 'couple', 'scenes', 'might', 'make', 'difference', 'accepting', 'conclusion', 'film', 'not.As', 'mentioned', 'previously', 'DVD', 'sports', 'two', 'versions', 'film', 'extended', 'cut', 'alternate', 'ending', 'great', 'extra', 'fans', 'want', 'experience', 'slightly', 'different', 'version', 'film', 'extended', 'ending', 'really', 'one', 'sequence', 'home', 'conclusion', 'film', 'bit', 'more', 'aggressively', 'conclusion', 'bit', 'less', 'nebulous', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'versions', 'have', 'merits', 'also', 'get', 'short', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'beginning', 'germ', 'idea', 'how', 'occurred', 'writer', 'Gerald', 'DiPego', 'how', 'developed', 'involvement', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'director', 'Joseph', 'Ruben', 'Many', 'behind-the-scenes', 'production', 'talent', 'appear', 'documentary', 'discussing', 'development', 'project', 'featurette', 'making', 'film', 'behind-the-scenes', 'making', 'film', 'sound', 'bites', 'featuring', 'main', 'cast', 'discussing', 'roles', 'what', 'attracted', 'project', 'first', 'place', 'are', 'done', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'additional', 'extras', 'optical', 'effects', 'used', 'film', 'also', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'many', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'version', 'film.A', 'gripping', 'thriller', 'will', 'have', 'guessing', 'fate', 'various', 'characters', 'film', 'Forgotten', ""n't"", 'likely', 'be', 'memory', ""'ll"", 'fade', 'away', 'old', 'photograph', 'rich', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'Dominic', 'West', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'ground', 'film', 'sense', 'reality', 'just', 'Telly', 'world', 'depart', 'Well', 'directed', 'intelligent', 'script', ""n't"", 'take', 'short', 'cuts', 'Forgotten', 'will', 'linger', 'like', 'memory', 'first', 'date', 'seeing', 'first', 'steps', 'child', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'forgotten', 'taken', 'away', 'rich', 'themes', 'heart', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'very', 'clear', ""'re"", 'someone', 'looking', 'clear', 'cut', 'resolutions', 'may', 'want', 'watch', 'extended', 'version', 'rent', 'buying', 'appeals', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'come', 'back', 'again', 'again', 'might', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'purchase']",N/A

868565,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B0006IIKQW,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[1, 3]","I had to see this movie for the simple reason that it's unimaginable that a heavy duty drama queen like Julianne Moore would take on a dark movie like this, not that she hasn't done an alien movie before, she did Revolution(a sci-fi comedy with David Duchovney). It's just nice to see her try something so refreshing after a handful 4-5 stars rated dramas(Safe, Magnolia, Far From Heaven, The Hours). Unfortunately, the script in The Forgotten  made sure she could flex her dramatic acting chops throughout the movie by allowing her to be in almost every scene, but forgot to intensify the supernatural/alien/the sky elements that made it a not so stimulating psychological journey.Yes, the supporting cast all contribute a good deal to their good roles to this lowkey mysterious headgame, and most of them either lose their memories or in the middle of nowhere get sucked into the sky by some magical or high-tech vaccumn cleaner from alien force or the Divine energy.The story evolves around Telly Paretta(Moore) who was the only person to have memory of her supposedly dead son who died in a plane crash 14 months earlier, and everyone else including her husband Jim(Anthony Edwards) thought she was delusional, because he never remember having a son. For 14 months, she had been seeing her shrink Dr.Munce(Gary Sinise), and even he thinks she was making things up. So she ""escaped"" from all this scrutiny from her trusted ones, thinking it was some kind of conspiracy, and head out to search for the truth. She went to see a man(Ash, played by Dominic West) whose daughter also died in the same plane crash and had absolutely no memory of it whatsoever. Telly helped him regain his memory when she uncovered a wall with all his daughter's drawings. Telly and Ash emabarked on a search together and at the same time they had became fugitives of the government. In the Police force, Det.Anne Pope(Alfre Woodard) was the only person to believe Telly's story, and she was on a quest to help her. Unfortunately, when she encounter the alien(Linus Roache), and upon failing to kill him with numerous gunshots, she too got vaccumned into the sky right in front of Telly. Pretty soon, almost everyone is taken or forgotten and it was upto Telly to go direct to the alien(based at the airport) and figure out everything on her own.....So to sum up, I think it's not a bad sci-fi/supernatural movie, but it really needed more special effects and visuals happening. The ending had a message of spirituality and if you love someone a great deal, no hi-tech will erase your memory for your love one like Telly Paretta. Anyways, it's not obvious enough that Linus Roache was an alien, because he had some compassion in the end for Telly, and he did have great power and his face turns ugly when he was mad. Maybe he was just a messager.",3,"Strong characters, minimal supernatural/alien activities.",1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,2826,"['had', 'see', 'movie', 'simple', 'reason', 'unimaginable', 'heavy', 'duty', 'drama', 'queen', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'would', 'take', 'dark', 'movie', 'not', ""n't"", 'done', 'alien', 'movie', 'did', 'Revolution', 'sci-fi', 'comedy', 'David', 'Duchovney', 'just', 'nice', 'see', 'try', 'something', 'so', 'refreshing', 'handful', '4-5', 'stars', 'rated', 'dramas', 'Safe', 'Magnolia', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'Hours', 'Unfortunately', 'script', 'Forgotten', 'made', 'sure', 'could', 'flex', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'chops', 'movie', 'allowing', 'be', 'almost', 'scene', 'forgot', 'intensify', 'supernatural/alien/the', 'sky', 'elements', 'made', 'not', 'stimulating', 'psychological', 'journey.Yes', 'supporting', 'cast', 'contribute', 'good', 'deal', 'good', 'roles', 'lowkey', 'mysterious', 'headgame', 'most', 'lose', 'memories', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'get', 'sucked', 'sky', 'magical', 'high-tech', 'vaccumn', 'cleaner', 'alien', 'force', 'Divine', 'energy.The', 'story', 'around', 'Telly', 'Paretta', 'Moore', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'have', 'memory', 'supposedly', 'dead', 'son', 'who', 'died', 'plane', 'crash', '14', 'months', 'earlier', 'everyone', 'else', 'including', 'husband', 'Jim', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'thought', 'was', 'delusional', 'never', 'remember', 'having', 'son', '14', 'months', 'had', 'been', 'seeing', 'shrink', 'Dr.Munce', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'even', 'was', 'making', 'things', 'up', 'escaped', 'scrutiny', 'trusted', 'ones', 'thinking', 'was', 'kind', 'conspiracy', 'head', 'search', 'truth', 'went', 'see', 'man', 'Ash', 'played', 'Dominic', 'West', 'daughter', 'also', 'died', 'same', 'plane', 'crash', 'had', 'absolutely', 'memory', 'Telly', 'helped', 'regain', 'memory', 'when', 'uncovered', 'wall', 'daughter', 'drawings', 'Telly', 'Ash', 'emabarked', 'search', 'together', 'same', 'time', 'had', 'became', 'fugitives', 'government', 'Police', 'force', 'Det.Anne', 'Pope', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'believe', 'Telly', 'story', 'was', 'quest', 'help', 'Unfortunately', 'when', 'encounter', 'alien', 'Linus', 'Roache', 'failing', 'kill', 'numerous', 'gunshots', 'too', 'got', 'vaccumned', 'sky', 'right', 'front', 'Telly', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'almost', 'everyone', 'taken', 'forgotten', 'was', 'upto', 'Telly', 'go', 'direct', 'alien', 'based', 'airport', 'figure', 'out', 'everything', 'own', '..So', 'sum', 'up', 'think', 'not', 'bad', 'sci-fi/supernatural', 'movie', 'really', 'needed', 'more', 'special', 'effects', 'visuals', 'happening', 'ending', 'had', 'message', 'spirituality', 'love', 'someone', 'great', 'deal', 'hi-tech', 'will', 'erase', 'memory', 'love', 'one', 'Telly', 'Paretta', 'Anyways', 'not', 'obvious', 'enough', 'Linus', 'Roache', 'was', 'alien', 'had', 'compassion', 'end', 'Telly', 'did', 'have', 'great', 'power', 'face', 'ugly', 'when', 'was', 'mad', 'Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'messager']",N/A
868566,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B0006IIKQW,Wuchak,"[2, 3]","Written by Gerald Di Pego and released in 2004, ""The Forgotten"" relays the story of Telly (Julianne Moore), a mother who discovers all traces of her deceased 9 year-old son have been erased, including photos, videos, documents and the memories of other people. Her psychologist (Gary Sinise) and husband tell her she's delusional, but she KNOWS otherwise. Thus begins a thrilling search for the truth where she teams up with Ash (Dominic West) whose daughter seems to have been erased from memory as well. They end up tangling with National Security Agents and more.I almost missed out on ""The Forgotten"" because of the very conflicting reviews. Two reliable reviewers gave the film 5/5 Stars, whereas other intelligent reviewers give it 1 Star. The reactions couldn't be more opposite, which isn't necessarily a bad thing since some of the best artistic items polarize opinion. In any event, I'm glad I decided to give it a chance because this is a powerful picture.In style, ""The Forgotten"" is very similar to ""The Mothman Prophesies;"" so if you like that film, you'll likely appreciate this one. There are similarities to The X-Files with the two protagonists, including a female redhead, searching for the truth in what is essentially a sci-fi/mystery tale. I've seen over a handful X-Files episodes in my day and I can honestly tell you that ""The Forgotten"" blows those segments out of the water. Don't get me wrong, the show's okay, just a tad overrated and boring IMHO. Gillian Anderson was the only noteworthy part of the show to me. (If you're a fan of the show, I'm not here to argue with you. People have different tastes).I'm not a super Julianne Moore fan, but I'd take her rather than leave her. What really works is her team-up with Dominic West. These two have phenomenal chemistry together.Because of the highly mixed reviews I was watching the first 15 minutes only half-attentive, but when Telly (Moore) confronts Ash (West) and subsequently teams up with him my attention immediately perked up. Ash is an ex-NHL player who's given up on life and turned to alcohol to drown out his sorrows. What tragic event happened that would cause him to throw in the towel and turn to the bottle? I'll leave that to you to discover.Anyway, remember the great masculine actors of the past, like Charleton Heston, Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds and even Marlon Brando (of course Brando's in a league of his own)? There was just something about them that set 'em apart and made you take notice when they were on screen. Dominic West is such an actor. He's very reminiscent of James Remar (remember him in ""The Warriors""?) This was my first exposure to West and it's my hope that he moves on to bigger and better things. He's that good.The subplot of Ash's drunkenness struck a chord with me because I know people -- incredibly talented people like Ash -- who've essentially given up and given in to alcohol, wasting their lives away. Not to mention the fact that I've been seriously tempted to give up as well at times (albeit not to alcohol). I can relate and I'm sure you can too.As noted, the film is a sci-fi/mystery tale and therefore the explanation (no spoilers) is rather outlandish, but not necessarily unbelievable. 2005's ""Flightplan"" was a similarly-themed film; although its explanation was not outlandish it was totally unbelievable; hence, it's not worth seeing as far as I'm concerned. So, anyway, if you can't handle outlandishness I suggest you forget ""The Forgotten.""Why do I say the outlandish explanation of the story is not necessarily unbelievable? Well, let me put it this way [POSSIBLE SPOILER, but not really]: If you were able to communicate with rats, would the rats believe you if you told them there were superior beings who wanted to use them to conduct important experiments? It's true whether the rats believed or not. Let's not be arrogant and think we're the all-and-end-all of the universe. We may be, but -- more likely -- we're not. That's all I'll say. [END SPOILER]""The Forgotten"" is essentially a story of love v.s. cold analytical thought. Personally I fall right in the middle between these two forces. This conflict is what made the character of Spock so fascinating. Remember the Star Trek episode ""This Side of Paradise"" where he was able to walk free of his strict adherence to logic and experience the warmth & joy of love for the first time? At the end of the episode he sadly states that it was the first time in his life that he was truly happy.""The Forgotten"" is a story of tortuous struggle and potential triumph, for both Telly and Ash.Although logic is important, love is more powerful. Not to mention warmer and joy/life-inducing.The film is short and sweet at a mere 1 hour and 26 minutes before credits. The dvd features an extended cut with an alternative ending wherein the possible conspiracy is less malevolent. Watch the theatrical cut first and then simply go to the deleted scenes section and watch the two deleted scenes and the alternate ending (unless you want to watch the ENTIRE film twice, that is; it's just not necessary). I'll say this, the kissing scene should have never been omitted. It works. But perhaps the filmmakers didn't want to paint Telly as a potential adulterer, which isn't a bad thing.Don't listen to the grumps who didn't 'get' ""The Forgotten."" The reason they didn't 'get' it is because their pendulum veers too heavily toward cold logic, but they don't have to stay that way. :)GRADE: A-",5,Love v.s. cold analytical thought,1216944000,"07 25,

As the answer to the puzzle of the missing children is slowly revealed to the viewer, it becomes progressively less believable and ultimately ridiculous. All the tension built up through the first part of the movie is just lost in a predictable and unsatisfactory ending.Having said that, the movie isn't all bad. There were at least 2, maybe 3, scenes that caused the entire theater to leap right out of their seats. It was great to see Alfrie Woodard for the first time in a long time, albeit in a role unworthy of an actress of her talent. The first half of the movie is intriguing, and had the(ultimately unrealized) promise of a fairly good thriller.
