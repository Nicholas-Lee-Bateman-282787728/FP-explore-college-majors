1278576,A1DRKVXO300RUE,B002MXN24E,Amazon Customer,"[7, 8]","I enjoyed this movie as a cute, foreign tongue-in-cheek style horror. Its a French film (and subtitled), and I'm on a current kick of interest in French things, so that might be clouding my otherwise critical eye. However, I do think its a good and fun film. In short, a group of vampires throw a party at a very remote castle for a random group of invitees, with the invitees getting more than they expected. The movie is told in a Shaun of the Dead tone, with horror elements that are rendered purposely ineffective through comic elements. However, it is well done, and highly amusing. The acting is good, production values quite high.  This may not be everyone's cup of tea though. You probably need to appreciate french humor and enjoy a comedy that has horror elements (not a horror with comic elements).",4,"Highly entertaining, but note caveats",1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,809,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'cute', 'foreign', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'style', 'horror', 'French', 'film', 'subtitled', ""'m"", 'current', 'kick', 'interest', 'French', 'things', 'might', 'be', 'clouding', 'otherwise', 'critical', 'eye', 'However', 'do', 'think', 'good', 'fun', 'film', 'short', 'group', 'vampires', 'throw', 'party', 'very', 'remote', 'castle', 'random', 'group', 'invitees', 'invitees', 'getting', 'more', 'expected', 'movie', 'told', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'tone', 'horror', 'elements', 'are', 'rendered', 'purposely', 'ineffective', 'comic', 'elements', 'However', 'well', 'done', 'highly', 'amusing', 'acting', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'quite', 'high', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'probably', 'need', 'appreciate', 'french', 'humor', 'enjoy', 'comedy', 'horror', 'elements', 'not', 'horror', 'comic', 'elements']",Vampire Party
1278577,A518CRYX4QKAH,B002MXN24E,Bookworm936,"[1, 2]",A slapstick comedy about friends going to a party hosted by vampires.  It was funny and predictable.  I was a bid disappointed in the count count who is suppose to be the boss.  The count's property gets stolen and he corners the thieves...then the sun comes up???  It's sort of disappointing. It's a nice little mind numbing movie to watch on a lazy weekend.,4,It was funny,1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,359,"['slapstick', 'comedy', 'friends', 'going', 'party', 'hosted', 'vampires', 'was', 'funny', 'predictable', 'was', 'bid', 'disappointed', 'count', 'count', 'who', 'suppose', 'be', 'boss', 'count', 'property', 'stolen', 'thieves', 'then', 'sun', 'up', 'sort', 'disappointing', 'nice', 'little', 'mind', 'numbing', 'movie', 'watch', 'lazy', 'weekend']",Vampire Party

Not many people know about this movie and when they hear the alternate title, they kind of shy away, but it really is hysterical.

First off, it's a French movie with English subtitles.  Now that is not a bad thing.....but when you're not expecting it.....  Figured I just had to set the dvd player to English and we'd be good to go.  Alas, that wasn't how it was to be, and I had to read the subtitles, which isn't a really big deal, once the movie flowed and you got into the characters and their lives.  Three friends, who Love to party, score some invite tickets to an exclusive party that has been rumored about for years.  They arrive in style--by helicopter--and it's loud music, sexy dancers, drinks flowing freely, comedic S&M, and long flowing, ""Fabio- manly"" locks from there on.  In the ladies restroom a little while later one of our heroines notices something amiss ( a dead body and loads of blood are a, ""dead"" give-away.)  and informs her friends that things are not quite what they seem.  What ensues is a lively cast of characters, from a vain, ditzy- ""prize"" mistress, to an ego-centric dentist, all trying to stay alive after they discover their hosts are blood thirsty vampires.  There are so many little things that you notice in the background, while the main stuff is happening-- plus one of the heroine's has a  job that helps her out for a little bit when she's going mano-a-mano with the bad guys,  and it is hilarious.  I really enjoyed this movie and my laughing was heard all the way upstairs.  If you're into the quirky and broad humor, ( such as ""Airplane"" ) and are not bothered by subtitles, then I think you will find this extremely funny as well.",4,A Pleasant Vamp Surprise,1266883200,"02 23, 2010",2010,1662,"['Had', 'never', 'heard', 'heard', 'dvd', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'loving', 'things', 'Vampire', 'bought', 'First', 'French', 'movie', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Now', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', '..but', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'expecting', 'Figured', 'just', 'had', 'set', 'dvd', 'player', 'English', ""'d"", 'be', 'good', 'go', 'Alas', 'was', ""n't"", 'how', 'was', 'be', 'had', 'read', 'subtitles', ""n't"", 'really', 'big', 'deal', 'once', 'movie', 'flowed', 'got', 'characters', 'lives', 'Three', 'friends', 'who', 'Love', 'party', 'score', 'invite', 'tickets', 'exclusive', 'party', 'been', 'rumored', 'years', 'arrive', 'style', 'helicopter', 'loud', 'music', 'sexy', 'dancers', 'drinks', 'flowing', 'freely', 'comedic', 'S', 'M', 'long', 'flowing', 'Fabio-', 'manly', 'locks', 'there', 'ladies', 'restroom', 'little', 'later', 'one', 'heroines', 'notices', 'something', 'amiss', 'dead', 'body', 'loads', 'blood', 'are', 'dead', 'give-away', 'friends', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'what', 'seem', 'What', 'lively', 'cast', 'characters', 'vain', 'ditzy-', 'prize', 'mistress', 'ego-centric', 'dentist', 'trying', 'stay', 'alive', 'discover', 'hosts', 'are', 'blood', 'thirsty', 'vampires', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'little', 'things', 'notice', 'background', 'main', 'stuff', 'happening', 'one', 'heroine', 'job', 'out', 'little', 'bit', 'when', 'going', 'mano-a-mano', 'bad', 'guys', 'hilarious', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'laughing', 'was', 'heard', 'way', 'upstairs', ""'re"", 'quirky', 'broad', 'humor', 'such', 'Airplane', 'are', 'not', 'bothered', 'subtitles', 'then', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'extremely', 'funny', 'as', 'well']",Vampire Party
