This set is the thinpack release and will have far fewer special features.This is an amazon shrink wrap grouping if sets the have lying around. This is something they se to do to clear stock. One might assume from rumors that this means it is true that a new set with blu ray might be coming out. Either way this is a fantastic set at an unbeatable price.At one time the prices for these seasons were unbelievable. In 2005 season 6 cost 150 dollars alone. If bought as a grouping today the seasons and movies together could have cost hundreds. This deal is a really fantastic price. Most of the seasons sell for 17-23 brand new.This is a great deal. The only drawbacks are that there still isn't a blu ray release. The only other slight issue that might make you want to hold off is that prime customers can stream every episode ever for free.  The only other small disappointment is that you will have to live with a set that has reduced set if special features, especially for the early seasons.The bottom line is that if you only care about possessing every episode ever with minimal frills then this is an unbeatable deal.",4,"""Reduced set"" at an incredible price",1380585600,"10 1, 2013",2013,1207,"['know', 'love', 'x', 'files', 'know', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'set', 'set', 'thinpack', 'release', 'will', 'have', 'far', 'fewer', 'special', 'features.This', 'amazon', 'shrink', 'wrap', 'grouping', 'sets', 'have', 'lying', 'around', 'something', 'se', 'do', 'clear', 'stock', 'One', 'might', 'assume', 'rumors', 'true', 'new', 'set', 'blu', 'ray', 'might', 'be', 'coming', 'out', 'way', 'fantastic', 'set', 'unbeatable', 'price.At', 'one', 'time', 'prices', 'seasons', 'were', 'unbelievable', '2005', 'season', '6', 'cost', '150', 'dollars', 'alone', 'bought', 'grouping', 'today', 'seasons', 'movies', 'together', 'could', 'have', 'cost', 'hundreds', 'deal', 'really', 'fantastic', 'price', 'Most', 'seasons', 'sell', '17-23', 'brand', 'new.This', 'great', 'deal', 'only', 'drawbacks', 'are', 'still', ""n't"", 'blu', 'ray', 'release', 'only', 'other', 'slight', 'issue', 'might', 'make', 'want', 'hold', 'off', 'prime', 'customers', 'can', 'stream', 'episode', 'ever', 'free', 'only', 'other', 'small', 'disappointment', 'will', 'have', 'live', 'set', 'reduced', 'set', 'special', 'features', 'especially', 'early', 'seasons.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'only', 'care', 'possessing', 'episode', 'ever', 'minimal', 'frills', 'then', 'unbeatable', 'deal']",X-Files: The Complete TV Series and Movie Collection

1650339,A3JRH8VCV09LM5,B00CRVL5ZE,C. Spurchise,"[1, 2]",I am a ardent fan of the X-Files television series. The stories are primarily about paranormal and extraterrestrial phenomena written in a style that includes not only melodramatic suspense but tongue-in-cheek comedy as well. Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny play their respective characters with great verve and are a pleasure to watch as they expose the falsity enacted by clandestine bureaucratic establishments that seek to control the world.,5,The Truth is Out There!,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,449,"['am', 'ardent', 'fan', 'X-Files', 'television', 'series', 'stories', 'are', 'primarily', 'paranormal', 'extraterrestrial', 'phenomena', 'written', 'style', 'not', 'only', 'melodramatic', 'suspense', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'comedy', 'well', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'play', 'respective', 'characters', 'great', 'verve', 'are', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'expose', 'falsity', 'enacted', 'clandestine', 'bureaucratic', 'establishments', 'seek', 'control', 'world']",X-Files: The Complete TV Series and Movie Collection
1650340,A3IIBE4D1VECWC,B00CRVL5ZE,D. Allen,"[2, 3]","I found the show on my Prime Instant Video on my iPad one day. I watched a few episodes and knew I had to get the entire series and couldn't resist buying it.Keep in mind this isn't a specialized collection. That is it doesn't come in a huge box like you'd find with other collections. Instead it's just seasons 1 through 9 and the two movies wrapped up into a collection. You don't get a special box that you can keep on your movie stand. That is one thing I'd like to clear out. Then again I never was a fan of boxes so just having the show is perfect.The series is 100% complete in that you follow Mulder and Scully from season 1 through the end. I never really had any liking to Robert Patrick starring in it and really haven't started watching that part of the show yet.I remember as a kid coming home everyday and watching XFiles among other great shows. I think I forgotten most of the shows and everytime I see it pop up, either by accident or through browsing, I have to check if there's a complete season pack for it or not. I'm very glad this is out on dvd and now I can watch it hopefully forever.So what makes XFiles so great? Well the reason is rather interesting. The show deals with what I would like to consider two types of episodes. The majority of the episodes centers around some sort of investigation into the supernatural. Mulder is typically interested and much more believable to ufos, mass government conspiracies, super natural beings, and other things of that nature. Scully acts as the skeptic in these episodes. She is more of the audience citing scientific reasons. I think it kind of gets annoying eventually when each episode falls into this pattern where Scully is skeptical, never believing and Mulder is the only one seemingly able to piece things together. However, the show does have a nice way to make it not so annoying but in all the show centers around this theme.The second type of episodes are generally the connecting episodes, if I can word that right. It centers around a greater plot that Mulder and Scully are in. The episodes loosely connects to one another overall in that some events Mulder and Scully take part in are brought up or connected in other episodes down the line. However, one consistent theme that generates some episodes is the greater conspiracy that Mulder and Scully are in where they fight against an unknown government cover up and they are left to solve it. These episodes sort of pan out throughout the season. One big theme is centered around Mulder and his sister who Mulder believes was abducted by aliens when they were young children. Throughout the seasons, Mulder experiences many explanations and findings about his missing sister. There is one episode that &#34;concludes&#34; it but brings up a lot more question and I don't think it really brings justice to the overall plot they were trying to show.XFiles have many funny episodes featuring Mulder and Scully. Some of my favorites include a Cop parody where Mulder and Scully unknowingly volunteered themselves to be on the hit TV show Cops. Other funny episodes include where Mulder and Scully go undercover to be husbands and wives in some crazy gated community with a weird home owners association and rules.The show gets into nearly every imaginable supernatural and conspiracy theories that you can think of. From basic witchcrafting all the way up to super government ufo coverups, the show really never left out anything.Overall the show is excellent. I think the show sort of had its niche in TV shows. For me, the show has made me read some books and such about the supernatural, ufos, mass government cover up, and so on. The odd thing is that in modern times, I think xfiles would prove excellent with all the recent events that took place mainly after the show ended. I wonder what xfiles would be like if it aired today? Probably more of a documentary than a hit tv show.My opinion is that everyone should get this dvd if you grew up in the 90s. This is probably one of the best series that ran during the 90s and I really can't imagine anyone not having this in their collection.",5,Forgotten about this show,1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,4128,"['found', 'show', 'Prime', 'Instant', 'Video', 'iPad', 'one', 'day', 'watched', 'few', 'episodes', 'knew', 'had', 'get', 'entire', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'buying', 'it.Keep', 'mind', ""n't"", 'specialized', 'collection', ""n't"", 'come', 'huge', 'box', ""'d"", 'find', 'other', 'collections', 'Instead', 'just', 'seasons', '1', '9', 'two', 'movies', 'wrapped', 'up', 'collection', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'special', 'box', 'can', 'keep', 'movie', 'stand', 'one', 'thing', ""'d"", 'like', 'clear', 'out', 'Then', 'again', 'never', 'was', 'fan', 'boxes', 'so', 'just', 'having', 'show', 'perfect.The', 'series', '100', '%', 'complete', 'follow', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'season', '1', 'end', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'liking', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'starring', 'really', 'have', ""n't"", 'started', 'watching', 'part', 'show', 'remember', 'kid', 'coming', 'home', 'everyday', 'watching', 'XFiles', 'other', 'great', 'shows', 'think', 'forgotten', 'most', 'shows', 'everytime', 'see', 'up', 'either', 'accident', 'browsing', 'have', 'check', 'complete', 'season', 'pack', 'not', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'out', 'dvd', 'now', 'can', 'watch', 'hopefully', 'what', 'XFiles', 'so', 'great', 'Well', 'reason', 'rather', 'interesting', 'show', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'consider', 'two', 'types', 'episodes', 'majority', 'episodes', 'centers', 'sort', 'investigation', 'supernatural', 'Mulder', 'typically', 'interested', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'ufos', 'mass', 'government', 'conspiracies', 'super', 'natural', 'beings', 'other', 'things', 'nature', 'Scully', 'skeptic', 'episodes', 'more', 'audience', 'citing', 'scientific', 'reasons', 'think', 'kind', 'annoying', 'eventually', 'when', 'episode', 'pattern', 'where', 'Scully', 'skeptical', 'never', 'believing', 'Mulder', 'only', 'one', 'seemingly', 'able', 'piece', 'things', 'together', 'However', 'show', 'have', 'nice', 'way', 'make', 'not', 'so', 'annoying', 'show', 'theme.The', 'second', 'type', 'episodes', 'are', 'generally', 'connecting', 'episodes', 'can', 'word', 'right', 'greater', 'plot', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'are', 'episodes', 'loosely', 'one', 'overall', 'events', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'take', 'part', 'are', 'brought', 'up', 'connected', 'other', 'episodes', 'line', 'However', 'one', 'consistent', 'theme', 'episodes', 'greater', 'conspiracy', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'are', 'where', 'fight', 'unknown', 'government', 'cover', 'up', 'are', 'left', 'solve', 'episodes', 'sort', 'pan', 'season', 'One', 'big', 'theme', 'centered', 'Mulder', 'sister', 'who', 'Mulder', 'was', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'children', 'seasons', 'Mulder', 'many', 'explanations', 'findings', 'missing', 'sister', 'one', 'episode', '34', 'concludes', '34', 'up', 'lot', 'more', 'question', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'justice', 'overall', 'plot', 'were', 'trying', 'show.XFiles', 'have', 'many', 'funny', 'episodes', 'featuring', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'favorites', 'include', 'Cop', 'parody', 'where', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'unknowingly', 'volunteered', 'be', 'hit', 'TV', 'show', 'Cops', 'Other', 'funny', 'episodes', 'include', 'where', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'go', 'undercover', 'be', 'husbands', 'wives', 'crazy', 'gated', 'community', 'weird', 'home', 'owners', 'association', 'rules.The', 'show', 'nearly', 'imaginable', 'supernatural', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'can', 'think', 'basic', 'witchcrafting', 'way', 'super', 'government', 'ufo', 'coverups', 'show', 'really', 'never', 'left', 'out', 'show', 'excellent', 'think', 'show', 'sort', 'had', 'niche', 'TV', 'shows', 'show', 'made', 'read', 'books', 'such', 'supernatural', 'ufos', 'mass', 'government', 'cover', 'up', 'so', 'odd', 'thing', 'modern', 'times', 'think', 'xfiles', 'would', 'prove', 'excellent', 'recent', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'mainly', 'show', 'ended', 'wonder', 'what', 'xfiles', 'would', 'be', 'aired', 'today', 'Probably', 'more', 'documentary', 'hit', 'tv', 'show.My', 'opinion', 'everyone', 'should', 'get', 'dvd', 'grew', 'up', '90s', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'ran', '90s', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'not', 'having', 'collection']",X-Files: The Complete TV Series and Movie Collection

1650350,A3ATINUJ8IPYFQ,B00CRVL5ZE,Jennifer Rodriguez,"[159, 162]","You can get series reviews everywhere. I write this to clarify what exactly this set consists of; I purchased the day of the Gold Box deal. I previously owned only three of the 'original' editions because they were SO honking expensive. The special features, on those sets, are to me not worth the extra hundred dollars, and I have not noticed any quality difference as far as this set's mastering/picture. I'm pretty sure it's the same data, just crammed into a smaller box and missing the 'bonus' disc.This particular set did not come in a display box, as the official 'complete' release did. This is just a copy of each season and each movie packing-taped together and shrink-wrapped after the fact (each set within is still individually factory shrink-wrapped).Don't flip out when you see seasons 1-4 are labeled fullscreen and 5-9 widescreen. They didn't gyp you; that's how they were aired and if fullscreen REALLY bugs you, wait for the rumored Blu-Ray release, because they will likely be widescreen. (The show was shot in wide from day 1, it simply wasn't aired that way because no one had widescreen TVs in 1993).The sets are 'slimpacked' and each one has plastic 'pages' inside that two or three of the discs will snap into. They are not paper-sleeved as I have heard said of the slimline sets in the past (maybe they were when originally released?) It seems to be just fine for scratch protection and wear.Overall, even at this current price, it's still a fair deal considering how many seasons there are and that each one is multiple discs, plus two movies, and we d not know for a fact there will BE a Blu-Ray release anytime soon. I would say,having seen both the slim and collector's editions, that it's NOT worth hunting older editions down individually for the bonus materials, though IF you find them individually for some insanely low price, go for it. Be aware, if you never saw the original box sets, you'll need a whole shelf. Some seasons, the box is three inches wide yet only houses one additional disc over these.
