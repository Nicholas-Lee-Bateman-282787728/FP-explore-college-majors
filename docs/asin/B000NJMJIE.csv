1057430,A1GHUN5HXMHZ89,B000NJMJIE,"C. A. Luster ""The Rook""","[2, 2]","At first it started slow and I almost thought it might be unimpressive. Was I ever wrong. Jane Doe, Lea Thompson, works as an agent at a top goverment agency. When agents are killed by other agents she investigates who is behind it. There are twists and turns to finding out since the agents don't recall what happened after they kill. Just when you think they have the culprit, out pops another ""red herring"" as they say in mysteries and they must find who really is behind the murders. Along with Joe Penny and William A. Moses, the cast incudes many stars from TV and movies over the last twenty years. They all do a great job. Lea Thompson gives an exceptional performance and shows she truly has great acting chops once again. I thought they did a great job of developing the side story with Lea as a happily married woman being a supportive wife with two children. The movie had much more too it than I ever would have imagined from the beginning and I'm glad I stuck with it. This was truly a sleeper for me. I had not heard of it before and just happened to rent it because it sounded interesting. I am so glad I did. After watching it I immediately purchased it from Amazon.
