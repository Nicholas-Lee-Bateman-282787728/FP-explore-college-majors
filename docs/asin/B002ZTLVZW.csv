1314510,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002ZTLVZW,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[53, 53]","I have been watching the comedian Sinbad for years.  From winning ""Star Search"" back in 1985 and seeing him on television from ""A Different World"", ""The Sinbad Show"" and the host of ""Vibe"".But for a comedian who has been on television for nearly two decades, when you haven't been seen for several years, people start to question if you're dead and in the case of the comedian, rumors filled the social media realm and Wikipedia that the comedian has died.  That was until Dec. 2009 when the comedian was featured in the media for his tax problems.Fortunately, the comedian hasn't shown any signs of slowing down.  In fact, Sinbad's latest Comedy Central DVD ""Where U Been?"" is a sign that there are comedians that still can entertain and get the audience going crazy after a performance.As his Comedy Central performance will be airing on television, the DVD features 45 minutes of material not shown on television.  This latest performance is actually one of the best performances I have seen from Sinbad and that is watching him perform his comedy routines for years.Sinbad goes into his routine about where he has been all these years, to his financial problems but easily transitions to that he's no different from millions Americans who are facing hard times during the country's economic slump.  From topics of President Obama, to relationships, taking questions from the audience especially from the ladies of what problems they have with their men and so much covered on this DVD.The comedy chapters for this DVD are:1. Intro2. Things U Don't Know About Me/We Have a Black President3. My People Coming in Late/Revealing Truth (High Yellow)4. Keepin' It Real/Times are Tight5. Men Quit Going to Strip Clubs/Why Women Hate Us6. Marriage is Work/Old Men Dating Young Girls7. Growing Old Together/I Can't See8. Audience Questions About Men and Women9. Men Training to be Husbands/My Mom Worked My Dad10. Ladies What Are U Mad About?11. Men are Simple/Men Snoring12. Men Share Menopause/Men are Messy13. Sex Changes After Marriage14. Grown Kids At the House/Kids Change Everything15. We Can't Wait `Til You Have Kids/My Father Cured My A.D.D.16. I Hate Taking Kids to Sports Practice/Quit Trying to Look Young17. I Am Falling Apart/Medical Marijuana18. Christian the Lion/Living with Nature19. Little Pocket Dogs/Immigration20. How to Get a Job/My Young People21. At 53 Years Old U Don't Care/At 17 Years Old U Are Not Ready22. The Customer Is Not Always Right23. I Am Not a Thrill Seeker24. Bringing the Band Out25. Let's Get It On26. Ol' school27. Hollywood Swinging28. Word UpVIDEO & AUDIO:""Sinbad - Where U Been?"" is featured in widescreen.  Various camera angles featuring closeups of Sinbad, behind the stage, side of the venues,  close up of the audience, just capturing the energy and mood of that evening.  Editing is well done, no dizzying several second cuts, you get various camera angles but giving your eyes enough time to enjoy the performance.The camera angles on the audience shows people who are just laughing hysterically and getting into the performance.  This is what I love seeing, where the audience is just digging the comedy, some looking like their guts are going to bust and even some with tears coming down their eyes because they are laughing so much.  This is rare to see on a Comedy Central comedy DVD and definitely a major positive for this DVD release!Audio is in Dolby Digital stereo.  The performance is front channel driven but for those with modern home theater receivers can easily set the audio for stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundtrack.  Sinbad's vocals come out crystal clear, the audience laughing can be heard very well and of course, the ending music performance sounds magnificent.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Sinbad - Where U Been?"" comes with the following special feature:* Behind the Scenes with Sinbad - (17:54) Sinbad talking about how people have asked him where he has been despite performing at a different city every weekend.  Also, performing with various musicians and preparing for the music segment of the DVD.JUDGMENT CALL:After watching ""Where U Been"", you literally come to realize why Sinbad is a legend.  And before anyone starts thinking, old school comedian that you watched in the '80s and '90s, don't even think that because Sinbad may be on top of his game then but the man is still on top of his game now.  You can feel that energy with the crowd that night.  There are many Comedy Central DVD's that I've reviewed and not many can keep that energy between the comedian and its audience for 90 minutes.  The audience was literally on their feet and just into the performance.The comedian doesn't have to launch into any shock value jokes, he knows his demographic and knows that there are young and old in the crowd and he keeps it real, keeps it fun and makes sure that people are being entertained.To end the performance, Sinbad and big name musicians take to the stage to play some music and even get the crowd going with their rendition of Cameo's 1986 hit ""Word Up!"".  Big surprises with ""Another World"" actress Dawnn Lewis showing up, talented keyboardist Greg Phillinganes along with many other talented musicians and also Michael Jackson ""THIS IS IT"" background singers Darryl Phinnessee, Judith Hill and Lamont Van Hook singing on backup for this special as well.Just a lively, energetic performance by Sinbad.  Hilarious and fun and definitely a magnificent performance worth watching.  As mentioned, I have seen Sinbad's performances but this is one of the best comedic performance from him that I have seen.  Especially to see the crowd so into the performance and as mentioned, tears running down the eyes of the audience because they are laughing uncontrollably.  It's one of those comedy performance nights that you just wish is captured on camera and in this case, that magic that night was.  Just awesome!""Sinbad - Where U Been?"" is Sinbad at his best, showing that over two decades later, he still has it and definitely a highly recommended Comedy Central DVD!",5,An awesome Sinbad comedy performance on DVD.

The laughs were lackluster at the beginning, he found out the ranting was a hit and he went with it. I can't knock that, but it got boring after the first couple of jokes mainly because people were complaining about the same stuff they do on relationship sites. We can get this information from a book, and a better one from comedians like Steve Harvey. *shrug* I wasn't into it. I actually wanted to fast forward past it, but I didn't want to miss out on something that could possibly be funny. That NEVER happened.Pros: When he stuck to his comedy routine, I laughed hard. His take on marriage and adult children living at home amused me more because I saw this DVD after I'd watched the entire season of his reality show. In typical Sinbad form, he made sure to remind us of the funk he's known for by playing the guitar and the drums. That was fun to watch. I don't know if it was fun enough for me to want to see again, but it was a pleasant surprise.Side note: The guy screaming out Metallica threw me completely. I definitely wouldn't want to listen to it when I'm older, but then again, it's not like I'm listening to Metallica now.
