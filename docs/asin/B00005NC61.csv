It occurs so naturally that, for a while, one of the guys is able to deny that it has happened at all.  But it has.At the start of this movie, you wonder where it is going.  But the wait is worth the time and effort because the characters are beautifully developed.  Karen Black is amazing.  She alone is worth seeing this movie.  The character of Emily also emerges nicely throughout the film.But it is the friendship between Griffith and Lee that is the focus of this film.  As many others have said, this is not a `gay' film.  The friendship emerges naturally and, toward the end of the film, both men realize that is has progressed beyond a friendship (although Lee knows it first).The setting is a tiny, confined southern town where the characters are further confined by the demands of their own lives.  Emily and Griffith use each other as a reason to stay until the reason no longer exists.  Griffith plans to leave with Lee but the realization that their friendship has progressed beyond friendship sends him into a crisis of sexual identity and he drives Lee away.  In the end, Emily leaves, Lee returns and the story winds down to a difficult but necessary conclusion.The only real complaint I have about this movie that sometimes the volume of the score drowns out the dialog.  It is sometimes difficult to hear what the characters are saying.  One such instance is a rather sweet scene between Lee and Griffith where you miss what Lee is saying just before he leaves.  Too bad to have missed that.I highly recommend this film but give it time.

The green lush grasses and trees, fields of flowers, and tree shaded creeks and streams is the setting for a indie flick that is just as rich.Taq Purvis directs this film of a man Griffith (Dan Montgomery) who is taking care of his aunt Summer (Karen Black) at her family farm. Grffith's cousin Emily (Aleksa Pallodino) is a sexually active young woman who is in love with Griffith perhaps because their really is no other people there, close to their age. While Griffith, Summer and Emily run the rutt that their lives have taken , a stranger named Lee (Walton Goggins) blows into town and stirs up these simple plain interactions.Red Dirt comes across at first as a little confusing to understand but soon the secrets that plauge Summer begin to surface and Griffith starts to develop feelings for Lee that he is unsure how to handle. Karen Black does an excellent job of playing the unhinged aunt and Goggins, Pallodino and Montgomery play well against each other and real chemistry develops. Dan Montogomery does steal this movie with an intense performance of a young man trying to sort out his feelings, come to terms with his aunts secrets, and make peace with whom he is and what lies in the future away from the families farm. An excellent movie that shows growth and depth of each character and  reveals the slow, difficult life of one individual coming to terms with adulthood and the world outside ones sphere.",4,The dirt on Red Dirt,1118793600,"06 15, 2005",2005,1529,"['Red', 'Dirt', 'south', 'actually', 'clay', 'breathtaking', 'scenery', 'film', 'green', 'lush', 'grasses', 'trees', 'fields', 'flowers', 'tree', 'shaded', 'creeks', 'streams', 'setting', 'indie', 'flick', 'just', 'rich.Taq', 'Purvis', 'film', 'man', 'Griffith', 'Dan', 'Montgomery', 'who', 'taking', 'care', 'aunt', 'Summer', 'Karen', 'Black', 'family', 'farm', 'Grffith', 'cousin', 'Emily', 'Aleksa', 'Pallodino', 'sexually', 'active', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'love', 'Griffith', 'perhaps', 'really', 'other', 'people', 'there', 'close', 'age', 'Griffith', 'Summer', 'Emily', 'run', 'rutt', 'lives', 'have', 'taken', 'stranger', 'named', 'Lee', 'Walton', 'Goggins', 'town', 'up', 'simple', 'plain', 'interactions.Red', 'Dirt', 'first', 'little', 'confusing', 'understand', 'soon', 'secrets', 'plauge', 'Summer', 'begin', 'surface', 'Griffith', 'develop', 'feelings', 'Lee', 'unsure', 'how', 'handle', 'Karen', 'Black', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'unhinged', 'aunt', 'Goggins', 'Pallodino', 'Montgomery', 'play', 'well', 'other', 'real', 'chemistry', 'Dan', 'Montogomery', 'steal', 'movie', 'intense', 'performance', 'young', 'man', 'trying', 'sort', 'out', 'feelings', 'come', 'terms', 'aunts', 'secrets', 'make', 'peace', 'whom', 'what', 'future', 'away', 'families', 'farm', 'excellent', 'movie', 'growth', 'depth', 'character', 'slow', 'difficult', 'life', 'one', 'individual', 'coming', 'terms', 'adulthood', 'world', 'ones', 'sphere']",N/A

What I HATE is the very loud musical score which overshadows the movie making it very difficult in places to hear the actors reciting their lines. I also hated the first 15 minutes or so that gave me the impression this film was going to be a major dud. On the contrary......... after it sets the plot in motion, it takes off and becomes a very good film. The story is about a young man in his early twenties who has never been in love. He has however been having a sexual affair with his female cousin (Aleksa Palladino) since childhood. She is madly in love with him and wants the two to settle down together and share their lives with one another. Griffith (the very handsome Dan Montgomery) on the other hands vows that he is going to leave Mississippi forever and never come back. Griffs whole life is centered around the plantation he was raised on. His parents killed when he was a baby, he was raised by his eccentric aunt (Karen Black), whom he later comes to know much more about. Black gives a wonderful performance as the crazy lady. Along comes Lee (Walter Goggins), a drifter passing through, who rents a house from Griff and the two form a very close friendship, and make plans to ride off into the sunset together. Everyone figures out the two are in love except for Griffith, who is totally blind to his own feelings and those of his new friend. A late coming of age film which deals with eccentricity, incest, gay romance, and many points of young love. Outside of the smothering soundtrack, the quality is top notch all around. Acting is superb. Montgomery and Palladino shine in their performance. Enough said. I recommend this film whole heartedly.",4,I love this movie.

667528,A342YAXL116N5A,B00005NC61,Dennis!,"[55, 59]","I'll admit that I only watched this movie when Amazon marketed it to me (probably because I've bought a gay-themed movie sometime within the past decade).  But then, I was glad that it was brought to my attention.""Red Dirt"" escaped my radar.  Was it even released in the mainstream?  Probably not ""big screen,"" but was it even released in indie houses?  Anyway, this movie tells the tale of Griffith, who seems to amble about aimlessly through life with some sense of obligation toward his aunt and no way to release his sexual urges except with his only-too-willing cousin.  Why do southern-themed movies always seem to be so steeped in social obligation and the concomitant suffocation and angst?The wonderful scenery and excellent directing job, and empathetic characters (some outstanding, though not superb, acting talent) truly bring you into a mythical world somewhere in the south (I forget where).  The story line is somewhere crossed between ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and ""The Lords of Discipline"": drifter (Lee Todd) comes by and ""befriends"" Griffith, who is so mired in his tragic existence on the family farm that it's difficult to tell if his relationship with Lee Todd is based on sheer boredom with his own existence than with some true feeling underlying homosexual tension, as we're led to believe.As far as a ""gay interest"" film (kinda), though, this film is refreshing.  Gay politics and stereotypes do not play into the film at all.  The characters are remarkably empathetic, and you somehow feel Griffith's pain.  The line is blurred, however, between the ""male bonding friendship"" between the two men and homosexual love, a distinction the movie would have done well to explore.  Could these two men not have formed a tight, close friendship -- even loved each other -- without being ""in love""?I suppose the end of the film, therefore, is not only reasonable, but a better resolution than if the two had ridden off into the sunset holding hands.  Maybe the two will cross paths again at some other point in time.  But maybe not.The movie is definitely worth the viewing, but not unless you're willing to invest some thought and even some heart.",4,"Different, subtle, with an indie flair",1026864000,"07 17, 2002",2002,2168,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'only', 'watched', 'movie', 'when', 'Amazon', 'marketed', 'probably', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'gay-themed', 'movie', 'sometime', 'past', 'decade', 'then', 'was', 'glad', 'was', 'brought', 'attention', 'Red', 'Dirt', 'escaped', 'radar', 'even', 'released', 'mainstream', 'Probably', 'not', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'even', 'released', 'indie', 'houses', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'tale', 'Griffith', 'who', 'amble', 'about', 'aimlessly', 'life', 'sense', 'obligation', 'aunt', 'way', 'release', 'sexual', 'urges', 'only-too-willing', 'cousin', 'Why', 'do', 'southern-themed', 'movies', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'so', 'steeped', 'social', 'obligation', 'concomitant', 'suffocation', 'angst', 'wonderful', 'scenery', 'excellent', 'directing', 'job', 'empathetic', 'characters', 'outstanding', 'not', 'superb', 'acting', 'talent', 'truly', 'bring', 'mythical', 'world', 'somewhere', 'south', 'forget', 'where', 'story', 'line', 'somewhere', 'crossed', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'Lords', 'Discipline', 'drifter', 'Lee', 'Todd', 'befriends', 'Griffith', 'who', 'so', 'mired', 'tragic', 'existence', 'family', 'farm', 'difficult', 'tell', 'relationship', 'Lee', 'Todd', 'based', 'sheer', 'boredom', 'own', 'existence', 'true', 'feeling', 'underlying', 'homosexual', 'tension', ""'re"", 'led', 'believe.As', 'far', 'gay', 'interest', 'film', 'kinda', 'though', 'film', 'refreshing', 'Gay', 'politics', 'stereotypes', 'do', 'not', 'play', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'remarkably', 'empathetic', 'somehow', 'feel', 'Griffith', 'pain', 'line', 'blurred', 'however', 'male', 'bonding', 'friendship', 'two', 'men', 'homosexual', 'love', 'distinction', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'explore', 'Could', 'two', 'men', 'not', 'have', 'formed', 'tight', 'close', 'friendship', 'even', 'loved', 'other', 'being', 'love', 'suppose', 'end', 'film', 'therefore', 'not', 'only', 'reasonable', 'better', 'resolution', 'two', 'had', 'ridden', 'off', 'sunset', 'holding', 'hands', 'Maybe', 'two', 'will', 'cross', 'paths', 'again', 'other', 'point', 'time', 'maybe', 'not.The', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'not', ""'re"", 'willing', 'invest', 'thought', 'even', 'heart']",N/A

Some critics expressed disappointment that this wasn't a great southern romance either straight or gay while others seem to have been unable to connect with the characters.While the premise is easily recognizable and perhaps, predictable, what Purvis did was take a standard situation - and give it a spin all its own with fresh, inviting characters.Purvis captures perfectly a small town in the deep South. With deadly silences its soundscape is hauntingly punctuated by birds, wolves, crickets, locust, and endless rain it is immediately haunting yet peaceful.Another element of the deep south is the employment of crazy women essential to any good southern tale. All four women in this story exhibit varying signs of madness as each attempts to hold on to her deeply hidden, long held secret. Purvis's women exhibit a wondrously wide - and wild - range of emotion bouncing from minor instability, madness profound wisdom and acceptance.One of the most touching elements of the film was the bonding connection between Emily and Aunt Summer, with Em's final ""goodbye"" one of those arrestingly beautiful moments so rarely truly captured on film.The gay repression angle works perfectly here, both men quiet about it, but Dan Montgomery, Jr. as Griffith is so actually socially nave and stunted as to believe what is going on between he and Lee (a wonderful performance by Walter Goggins) is devoid of any sexual or romantic leanings:  a pure friendship.  This makes his final unhinging and dangerous rage believable and ultimately moving.Comments about Karen Black's being ""all over the place"" are correct, but this is not a bad thing. Her character is just that - emotionally unstable, a lifetime of guilt over her secret which is what is driving her mad. We see that pent up madness within her escaping in her dramatic loony-tune sequences and her escape into her world of music makes perfect sense.There were complaints of the lack of romantic ending, yet I can't imagine a more classically ""romantic"" finale then this. Rage, revelation and confusion subside into sadness, forgiveness, self-awareness and acceptance - all as the sun streams down on a glorious southern evening.Physically, as well, this is a stunning film, the photography breathtaking, the Purvis's use and sense of color vivid and true.In all honesty I did not expect to enjoy Red Dirt at all and was surprised to find myself drawn to these characters and watching them in their self-imposed exiles all the while futilely trying to connect to each other.

667540,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B00005NC61,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[1, 3]","SPOILERS++++++SPOILERS+++++++SPOILERS++++++++SPOILERS++++++++SPOILERSWhile an ending's being happy is not a requirement in any good film, it is certainly important that it be comprehensible. And in the case of this film, that ending is completely incomprehensible to me (you know, just doesn't make sense). Here we have an aimless drifter (Lee Todd) who we are led to believe has no particular goal in life, no place he needs to head out to (early on he even says himself: ""Hell, I don't even know where I'm headed, exactly."" Character Griffth's response: ""You're driving without any direction?"" Then, Lee: ""I was headed this way."" Then, Griffith: ""East, without any destination?"" Finally, Lee: ""Yeah."") And, so what happens at film's end (after Griffith's being told a bit of rather astonishing and unsettling relationship news by Karen Black's character) when G. finally realizes and declares his love for Lee, but at the same time indicates he cannot leave together as they'd planned? Well, what happens is that the busy, busy, suddenly-on-a-mission Lee finds it vital to immediately leave the scene? Duh! Must be he has an appointment with the President of the United States, or some such, and there's just no way it could or would ever be rescheduled. Plus, I guess it's not at all important that he's just heard the one declaration he'd been hoping to hear from the man he loves. In the final analysis, I do think that Griffith would have gone off with Lee had he not just found out what he did (but for now it would have to wait). Therefore, I cannot blame Griffith for the choice he made, at a critical point in his life----I can understand it. What I cannot understand is Lee's final behavior of hurrying up and 'skeedadling.' Perhaps Director Purvis has some reasoning for it (possibly he needed a tragic or unhappy ending?), but it's certainly beyond my comprehension. (Too bad the DVD is missing a Director's Commentary).Despite my problem concerning logicality of the script, I nevertheless have to recognize one especially notable thing about this production. For me, that is the one actor who truly stands head and shoulders above the rest: Walton Goggins. This man possesses a very unusual ""trembling intensity"" to the emotional level he reaches in some scenes......an intensity which builds to the point of being passed to the viewer. A particularly notable example of this is a near end-of-film scene in which he has found Griffith to say goodbye. The emotional ""shaking"" which he is able to build to, as he apologizes for past feelings and acts expressed to Griffith, reaches an almost overwhelming level, pulling us--almost shaking as well--into his emotional turmoil. We not only watch and hear what he is saying; we begin to feel what he is feeling. Now, that's acting.NOTE: One full star has been awarded just for what are, till recently, the most beautifully filmed outdoor scenes ever noted in a production having a major gay theme. The film's Introductory/Credit Roll scenes, as well as other outdoor shots, are absolutely stunning.

BUT there are some wonderful moments in the film.  The story is about love, acceptance, courage and self-discovery.  The main character, Griffith, contemplates starting a new life and finding love.There are some beautiful shots in the beginning of the film with the rain falling down on the lilypads in the river.  Personally, I thought Dan Montgomery as Griffith was great.  Even though his accent was little off I thought he gave a very emotional and sensitive performance.  There was a lot of subtlties that I think a lot of viewers missed.  For example, one of the best and saddest scenes in the film is when Griffith and Lee say goodbye to each other.  Just the stillness of each of the actors in the scene was very powerful.  And when they clasp their hands together and the tears come it added so much more.  It wasn't this whole flashy ""don't leave me or I'll die"" kind of acting.  It was very subtle and powerful.  Now I know a lot of viewers expressed that it was some sort of ""cope out"" but if they were following the story closely enough they would know why Griffith stayed behind.  A lot of people have issues and reasons as to why they choose to stay where they are and Griffith clearly had his.  We may not want to accept them but it's the honest truth.  I think that's what a lot of people didn't like about this film.  It didn't end ""happily ever after"" as the majority of us expected.  It didn't fall into the cliche' of two people walking hand and hand into the sunset.  Mind you it's perfectly okay to watch those kinds of movies but once and awhile I want to see something that honestly shows the other spectrum.  It may be painful and sad to watch but it's so much more interesting.  Personally, I don't care for all that typical, cliche' ridden trash that mainstream Hollywood seems to be making more and more these days.  Give me something that'll make me think.  Mind you ""Red Dirt"" isn't that great of a film.

Opinions seem to fall into two categories:  people either really liked it, or really disliked it.  For starters, let's clear up any confusion over what the film is, and what it's trying to be.  It is not a film about coming out.  It is not a film that contains scenes with overt male sexual contact (though there is overt heterosexual contact).  There is a powerful love interest between the two male leads, but the film doesn't hit the viewer over the head with it. For some viewers, that will make the film too slow and too boring.  I think that they're missing the point.The story starts slowly, and the dialog at the very beginning sounded stilted and stereotypically Southern gothic.  However, that problem disappeared within a few minutes, and overall, I found the screenplay to be believable and well written.  I agree with the reviewers who praised Karen Black's performance.  In fact, the entire cast was quite good. In spite of their various flaws, each of them had some trait or characteristic that allowed the viewer to identify with them.My main objection was the quality of the DVD transfer, which others have praised.  I didn't like the washed-out picture quality that seemed to afflict almost every daylight scene.  The actual cinematography was excellent, with beautifully composed scenes, but too many seemed to be over-exposed.  This may have been a conscious decision on the part of the director to make some sort of artistic statement, but if so, it escaped me.  The interior and night-time scenes were more balanced.My other complaint had to do with the soundtrack.  The DVD offers two options, a 5.1 surround, and a 2-channel surround.  The 5.1 soundtrack was inferior to the 2-channel track.  As an example, the ambient noise of crickets at night was quite audible on the 2-channel track, but dropped out entirely with the 5.1 track.  Dialogue was also more muffled with the 5.1 track.  This is of course the exact opposite of what one would expect.Aside from these technical problems, the film itself is very good.",4,A very good film,1073088000,"01 3, 2004",2004,2118,"['are', 'enough', 'reviews', 'here', 'give', 'plot', 'details', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'Opinions', 'seem', 'fall', 'two', 'categories', 'people', 'really', 'liked', 'really', 'disliked', 'starters', 'let', 'clear', 'confusion', 'what', 'film', 'what', 'trying', 'be', 'not', 'film', 'coming', 'out', 'not', 'film', 'scenes', 'overt', 'male', 'sexual', 'contact', 'overt', 'heterosexual', 'contact', 'powerful', 'love', 'interest', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'film', ""n't"", 'hit', 'viewer', 'head', 'viewers', 'will', 'make', 'film', 'too', 'slow', 'too', 'boring', 'think', ""'re"", 'missing', 'point.The', 'story', 'slowly', 'dialog', 'very', 'beginning', 'sounded', 'stilted', 'stereotypically', 'Southern', 'gothic', 'However', 'problem', 'disappeared', 'few', 'minutes', 'overall', 'found', 'screenplay', 'be', 'believable', 'well', 'written', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'praised', 'Karen', 'Black', 'performance', 'fact', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'spite', 'various', 'flaws', 'had', 'trait', 'characteristic', 'allowed', 'viewer', 'identify', 'them.My', 'main', 'objection', 'was', 'quality', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'others', 'have', 'praised', 'did', ""n't"", 'washed-out', 'picture', 'quality', 'seemed', 'afflict', 'almost', 'daylight', 'scene', 'actual', 'cinematography', 'was', 'excellent', 'beautifully', 'composed', 'scenes', 'too', 'many', 'seemed', 'be', 'over-exposed', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'conscious', 'decision', 'part', 'director', 'make', 'sort', 'artistic', 'statement', 'so', 'escaped', 'interior', 'night-time', 'scenes', 'were', 'more', 'balanced.My', 'other', 'complaint', 'had', 'do', 'soundtrack', 'DVD', 'two', 'options', '5.1', 'surround', '2-channel', 'surround', '5.1', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'inferior', '2-channel', 'track', 'example', 'ambient', 'noise', 'crickets', 'night', 'was', 'quite', 'audible', '2-channel', 'track', 'dropped', 'out', 'entirely', '5.1', 'track', 'Dialogue', 'was', 'also', 'more', 'muffled', '5.1', 'track', 'course', 'exact', 'opposite', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect.Aside', 'technical', 'problems', 'film', 'very', 'good']",N/A

The acting was more than satisfying to me, particularly that of Walt Groggins, who plays the stranger who rents the cottage. I am in the process of watching a number of films that contain gay themes this month (Happy Gay Pride to all those out there who know what that means) and this movie fits somewhere toward one of the ends in the breadth of the definition of the genre. The ending, though not how I would have wanted the story to end, was still acceptable. I was left with the feeling that things just might continue between the two male characters eventually...but that for now, the happy ending I was looking for would have to wait (a little like real life, ya think?).My only gripe with the film itself concerns the accents and it's a complaint that I can live with. The southern accents of the different characters here are rathered varied from one another and at times when the characters shout at each other, they seem to dissappear altogether. Another reviewer mentioned that the accents were way over the top when it comes to how people really talk in rural Mississippi, but since I am not a southerner (except for living in NE Florida) I can't agree or disagree with his remark. I can only say that there were times when I couldn't quite understand what was being said. But that problem is easily remedied on a DVD with Subtitles for the Hearing Impaired, a feature I have used time and time again with movies such as this (another film that was greatly helped by SFTHI was Robert Altman's ""Gosford Park"")However, that leads to my other gripe...because you see, there were NO offering of subtitles that would have helped me know what was being said. Actually there were very little in way of extras on the DVD at all (except a trailer that I would STRONGLY suggest the viewer not bother with..unless one desires to be misled completely about the nature or feeling of the film).

And at the end, I felt I was right.So subtle in atmosphere, with raindrops rolling off of the leaves of aquatic plants in a swamp, vivid descriptions of the heat and humidity, real or imagined, were awesome.  We see a depiction of slow southern life where love between cousins, while seemingly accepted, is still questioned.  One gets the sense that Griffith and Emily are together because they are the only male and female of similar age anywhere around.The story plays out like so many do--people stuck in their existence without the means or motivation to change or move on.  But one has to question whether moving on is the right thing to do or not.  People just have to have a reason to question their circumstances.For Griffith, the appearance of Lee opens up an entirely new world.  Lee has an interest in seeing Griffith explore the world.  And as the friendship develops, Lee becomes the person who naturally would want to take Griffith on that journey.  But there are huge obstacles to overcome.  Who will care for Summer?In the end, Griffith who wanted so much to leave decides to stay.  Why?  Many reasons.  The best reason being he discovered he had the power to leave, which had always been absent.At the end, one could say that only Emily moved on, but that would not be true.  Griffith found love and friendship and the power to move on in the future.  Summer made strides to be more independent and less afraid of the world around her.I finish the film with the hope that Lee sends post cards and letters from out west and Griffith with join him.",5,"Astonishing film, stunning locations",1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,1764,"['opening', 'scene', 'Griffith', 'Emily', 'lush', 'green', 'vegetation', 'up', 'tree', 'incredible', 'theme', 'music', 'rolling', 'credits', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'fine', 'film', 'end', 'felt', 'was', 'right.So', 'subtle', 'atmosphere', 'raindrops', 'rolling', 'leaves', 'aquatic', 'plants', 'swamp', 'vivid', 'descriptions', 'heat', 'humidity', 'real', 'imagined', 'were', 'awesome', 'see', 'depiction', 'slow', 'southern', 'life', 'where', 'love', 'cousins', 'seemingly', 'accepted', 'still', 'questioned', 'One', 'sense', 'Griffith', 'Emily', 'are', 'together', 'are', 'only', 'male', 'female', 'similar', 'age', 'anywhere', 'around.The', 'story', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'do', 'people', 'stuck', 'existence', 'means', 'motivation', 'change', 'move', 'one', 'question', 'moving', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'not', 'People', 'just', 'have', 'have', 'reason', 'question', 'circumstances.For', 'Griffith', 'appearance', 'Lee', 'up', 'entirely', 'new', 'world', 'Lee', 'interest', 'seeing', 'Griffith', 'world', 'friendship', 'Lee', 'person', 'who', 'naturally', 'would', 'want', 'take', 'Griffith', 'journey', 'are', 'huge', 'obstacles', 'overcome', 'Who', 'will', 'care', 'Summer', 'end', 'Griffith', 'who', 'wanted', 'so', 'much', 'leave', 'decides', 'stay', 'Why', 'Many', 'reasons', 'best', 'reason', 'being', 'discovered', 'had', 'power', 'leave', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'end', 'one', 'could', 'say', 'only', 'Emily', 'moved', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'Griffith', 'found', 'love', 'friendship', 'power', 'move', 'future', 'Summer', 'made', 'strides', 'be', 'more', 'independent', 'less', 'afraid', 'world', 'her.I', 'finish', 'film', 'hope', 'Lee', 'post', 'cards', 'letters', 'west', 'Griffith', 'join']",N/A

The main character, Griffith, comes to know who he is and what his place in the world is.  While the film is visually compelling it is also well written with realistic characters.The story opens with Griffith and his cousin Emily both dreaming of different paths in their lives.  He longs to escape the small town they grew up in and she can't ever see herself ever leaving.  Just under the surface there's a sense of desperation in Griffith and Emily - but it takes the arrival of a stranger to bring this out.  Karen Black plays Griffith's invalid aunt - a woman haunted by her hidden past and her agoraphobia.  As the story develops, the film manages to portray an wonderfully uneasy balance that most films lack - the overall sense of isolation and need to escape with the soul deep bond between Griffith and the land.  The ending is anything but pat, leaving open the paths the characters will walk - but is very moving.By the end of the film, I really felt as if these were real people with real problems - not just hollywood cardboard cutouts.

667561,AF2UOFC8BTHLC,B00005NC61,"""yaaah69""","[11, 18]","I really wanted to like this movie, and for the most part it was entertaining.Tag purvis, whoever he is, captured the southern psyche in this semi-quasi-homo-erotic -incestuous-brooding-sweaty tale, of woe.Purvis wanders around our characters as a 5 year old in a candy store. He just cannot seem to be able to pick the candy he wants, but,he has all these choices.Unfortunatly for us he is like a southern honey-bee, trying to pollinate all, but, is unable to bring to fruit, (no pun tended) the essence of his characters.There is a great scene of Palladino and Dan making love under a tree, and the way Dans' foot slips in and out of his pant-leg  in rhythm , is very turn-on!!Karen Black did a fair job of the southern stressed woman, and Palladino as the cousin and lover of Griffith (Dan Montgomery),does a great job.Lee,(Walton Goggins)comes to town and rents a cottage that Griffith is fixing up to rent. There is an instant rapport between Lee and Griffith and they spend much time together, working on the cottage, (which I would die for) but, we cannot see this  develope as the camera is focusing on Karen and Pallodino.Things come to a head when Griffith tells his aunt Karen and cousin, that he is leaving with Lee. Lee is trying to get him to leave, as he can see the emptiness in Griffith and the total futility of staying in this hick town and the bad relationship with his cousin.They draw blood on their palms and make a vow to leave.Pallidino accuses Griffith of being in love with Lee, and Griffith reacts violently to Pallidino, and  tries to rape her to prove his manhood, she fights him off and he goes to find Lee. He confronts Lee, denies his feelings for him, hitting Lee and knocking Lee down.Lee  leaves town, going to Calif. as he and Griff had planned, Pallidino leaves town and Griffith is still there, now alone, as he had told Pallidino he did not love her and their affair was wrong.Lee returns, as he cannot leave without saying how sorry he was for assuming Griffs' love. Griffith is very glad to see him. There is a  scene of the two men looking longingly at each other, and saying how sorry they were to fight. They get closer together and finally kiss. Now this is where Purvis drops the ball. All this longing, pent-up emotion between these two great looking men and all Purvis does is let them have a 3 second kiss. Not even-opened-mouth. With that much virile emotion, and their lips touching, they would have been overwhelmed by passion and that kiss should have been as if they were devouring each other; and then gone off into the woods.Some say they like that the movie did not go any further, but I say if you have two men, gay or straight acting like gay men, then they  (Director) and actors should have enough guts  to make it at least look as though they really meant it.i.e. 'The Velocity of Gary', 'Urbania', to name a few. You never saw them in bed , but, their characters were loving to each other and their kiss's were believable. Red Dirt took the gay movie and sent it back to the darkness!!I bought this DVD and will add it to my collection. But, I will think twice about buying another Tag Pervus and or Windstar video.
