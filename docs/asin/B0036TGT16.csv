Tod is a fox whose parents have died. His best friend is a hunting dog named Copper. As Copper grows up, he learns that it is his job to hunt foxes. Tod's caretaker Widow Tweed takes Tod to live in a game preserve where he falls madly in love with Vixey. Copper and his owner eventually enter the preserve to hunt Tod, and eventually Copper must decide between duty and friendship.2.THE FOX AND THE HOUND 2 (2006)-Fame threatens to come between the two friends who go together like dogs and fleas in this animated follow-up to the beloved Disney classic ""The Fox and the Hound"".

I don't even remember ever seeing the sequel ""The Fox and the Hound II"" so this DVD combo was especially fun to watch.  I got to relieve part of my childhood and watch the beloved characters in a sequel, this time I shared it with my boys!  My youngest son loves dogs and he really got a kick out of watching these movies.  While the quality has definitely improved on the Blu-ray versions, it is still a 30-year old movie and the quality is somewhat older looking - I appreciate that though and feel it adds the classic Disney movie touch to it.  I would recommend purchasing this 3-disc Blu-ray combo because it not only improves the animation quality but it comes with the Blu-ray versions, DVD versions and some great bonus features!""The Fox and Hound"" is a great family movie to watch too because of the great lesson it teaches.  The movie shows how even though the characters are different that they can still be friends.  With my sons both starting preschool next week I want them to start off fresh being friends with everyone and not singling anyone out.

The only thing that I can say is that I hope this practice won't become the standard for subsequent Disney films because it just downgrades the overall package. With just being said, now I will proceed to review the original film.The Fox and the Hound was a movie that changed everything in Disney's animation department. All the legendary nine old men has retired or were involved for a limited time in the producion of this film. Most of it, went to the new guard, a guard that included Glen Keane, John Musker, Ron Clements and many others (inlcuding Tim Burton and John Lasseter). This guys have become as legendary as the nine old men in the animation world, but back then they were just the newcomers. TFATH was plagued with problems. Animator Don Blunth left Disney and took half of the animators with him and the animation department wasn't the success that had been when Walt Disney was still alive. When the movie was released in 1981 was a modest success and since then it has grown in popularity but it's still not as appreciated as the early Disney classics or the ones that were released in the 90s.The Fox and the Hound tells the story of Tod and Copper a fox and a hound (obviously) who become friends while they are young but their friendship is challenged when they are adults. The story is darker than many other animated films and resembles Bambi in many parts (although it's not as good as that one). Even though, this film is very endearing and enyojable and has many touching moments. Also it was the first Disney film without a proper happy ending and the effort of doing a satisfying finale is aprecciated. The animation is really good especially the scene where they fight the bear. That scene is impressive. All in all, The Fox and the Hound may not be an instant classic as othe Disney films are but it's one or their better efforts and deserves to be seen by any animation lover.Video & Audio:The case claims that the movie has been given a new digital restoration and while I don't doubt that, I do doubt that it was a complete restoration. The Fox and the Hound is not the best looking Disney blu-ray and it clearly shows some imperfections. The most jarring one is the appearance of a line in the right corner of the screen that comes and goes as it pleases. While is distracting, it's not as distracting as many others have said. Also there are some scenes that appear really soft and some artifatcs appear now and then.On the positive side, the movie appears for the first time in its original aspect ratio of 1.66:1 widescreen. That alone is a reason for joy but the also the colors are well reproduced, detail is trong and contrast is sharp. Make no mistake, this is the best that The Fox and the Hound has looked on home video but I suspect that a little more effort would have made it look even better.The 5.1 DTS-HD MA is more pleasing than its video counterpart and while is front heavy, the sound is smoother, the dialogue is clear and overall delivers a good experience.Bonus Features:This is the most dissapointing part of the disc. The BD just comes with one extra: ""Unlikely Friends"" a featurette that explains how many animals that are supposed to be enemies are friends in the real world. While is fun to watch it, I really expect something better for a set that says ""30th Anniversary Edition"". The DVD that is included comes with two extras:""Passing the Batton"" is a short featurette of how TFATH signaled a change in Disney and many people involved talked about their experiences in the film. The other extra is a sing along of the song ""Best of Friends"". To add insult to injury, I can't believe that the DVD actually has a better extra than the BD. Very dissapointing.Closing Thoughts:The Fox and the Hound is a little movie that has an endearing story, nice characters and good messages. It deserves a better reputation that the one it has and also deserves to be watched (at least once). Disnet BD set offers an adequate albeit imperfect release with solid but not perfect video and good audio. The most dissapointing part is the lack of bonus features (and the inclusion of something that hardly qualifies as a ""movie""). Anyway with all it's pros and cons, this release is recommended on the strengths of the film.",4,Disney Animated Classic #24: An Imperfect release for an underrated movie,1314576000,"08 29, 2011",2011,4409,"['Note', 'Due', 'strong', 'disliking', 'disgust', 'Disney', 'DTV', 'cheapquels', 'wo', ""n't"", 'review', 'mention', 'one', 'included', 'set', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'hope', 'practice', 'wo', ""n't"", 'become', 'standard', 'subsequent', 'Disney', 'films', 'just', 'overall', 'package', 'just', 'being', 'said', 'now', 'will', 'proceed', 'review', 'original', 'film.The', 'Fox', 'Hound', 'was', 'movie', 'changed', 'everything', 'Disney', 'animation', 'department', 'legendary', 'nine', 'old', 'men', 'retired', 'were', 'involved', 'limited', 'time', 'producion', 'film', 'Most', 'went', 'new', 'guard', 'guard', 'included', 'Glen', 'Keane', 'John', 'Musker', 'Ron', 'Clements', 'many', 'others', 'inlcuding', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'John', 'Lasseter', 'guys', 'have', 'become', 'as', 'legendary', 'nine', 'old', 'men', 'animation', 'world', 'back', 'then', 'were', 'just', 'newcomers', 'TFATH', 'was', 'plagued', 'problems', 'Animator', 'Don', 'Blunth', 'left', 'Disney', 'took', 'half', 'animators', 'animation', 'department', 'was', ""n't"", 'success', 'had', 'been', 'when', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'When', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '1981', 'was', 'modest', 'success', 'then', 'grown', 'popularity', 'still', 'not', 'as', 'appreciated', 'early', 'Disney', 'classics', 'ones', 'were', 'released', '90s.The', 'Fox', 'Hound', 'story', 'Tod', 'Copper', 'fox', 'hound', 'obviously', 'who', 'become', 'friends', 'are', 'young', 'friendship', 'challenged', 'when', 'are', 'adults', 'story', 'darker', 'many', 'other', 'animated', 'films', 'resembles', 'Bambi', 'many', 'parts', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'Even', 'film', 'very', 'endearing', 'enyojable', 'many', 'touching', 'moments', 'Also', 'was', 'first', 'Disney', 'film', 'proper', 'happy', 'ending', 'effort', 'doing', 'satisfying', 'finale', 'aprecciated', 'animation', 'really', 'good', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'fight', 'bear', 'scene', 'impressive', 'Fox', 'Hound', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'instant', 'classic', 'othe', 'Disney', 'films', 'are', 'one', 'better', 'efforts', 'deserves', 'be', 'seen', 'animation', 'lover.Video', 'Audio', 'case', 'movie', 'been', 'given', 'new', 'digital', 'restoration', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'do', 'doubt', 'was', 'complete', 'restoration', 'Fox', 'Hound', 'not', 'best', 'looking', 'Disney', 'blu-ray', 'clearly', 'imperfections', 'most', 'jarring', 'one', 'appearance', 'line', 'right', 'corner', 'screen', 'distracting', 'not', 'as', 'distracting', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'Also', 'are', 'scenes', 'appear', 'really', 'soft', 'artifatcs', 'appear', 'now', 'then.On', 'positive', 'side', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.66:1', 'widescreen', 'alone', 'reason', 'joy', 'also', 'colors', 'are', 'well', 'reproduced', 'detail', 'trong', 'contrast', 'sharp', 'Make', 'mistake', 'best', 'Fox', 'Hound', 'looked', 'home', 'video', 'suspect', 'little', 'more', 'effort', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'look', 'even', 'better.The', '5.1', 'DTS-HD', 'MA', 'more', 'pleasing', 'video', 'counterpart', 'while', 'front', 'heavy', 'sound', 'smoother', 'dialogue', 'clear', 'overall', 'delivers', 'good', 'experience.Bonus', 'Features', 'most', 'dissapointing', 'part', 'disc', 'BD', 'just', 'one', 'extra', 'Unlikely', 'Friends', 'featurette', 'how', 'many', 'animals', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'enemies', 'are', 'friends', 'real', 'world', 'fun', 'watch', 'really', 'expect', 'something', 'better', 'set', '30th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'included', 'two', 'extras', 'Passing', 'Batton', 'short', 'featurette', 'how', 'TFATH', 'signaled', 'change', 'Disney', 'many', 'people', 'involved', 'talked', 'experiences', 'film', 'other', 'extra', 'sing', 'song', 'Best', 'Friends', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'DVD', 'actually', 'better', 'extra', 'BD', 'Very', 'dissapointing.Closing', 'Thoughts', 'Fox', 'Hound', 'little', 'movie', 'endearing', 'story', 'nice', 'characters', 'good', 'messages', 'better', 'reputation', 'one', 'also', 'be', 'watched', 'least', 'once', 'Disnet', 'BD', 'set', 'offers', 'adequate', 'albeit', 'imperfect', 'release', 'solid', 'not', 'perfect', 'video', 'good', 'audio', 'most', 'dissapointing', 'part', 'lack', 'bonus', 'features', 'inclusion', 'something', 'hardly', 'movie', 'pros', 'cons', 'release', 'recommended', 'strengths', 'film']",N/A

1328876,A106YXO3EHVD3J,B0036TGT16,"DR SHOCK ""MR. KIA RETURNS! ;-b""","[1, 1]","Disney Studios 24th full length animated feature film. The Fox and the Hound is another decent entry in the Disney animated film cannon with some familiar voice work and great animation. the new Xerography process while being a cost saving achievement did not make these newer films better in my opinion, in fact they just don't have the Disney luster we've all become accustomed to.While this isn't Disney at it's best it is an enjoyable and pretty solid film. The animation process has been fleshed out more and the new process isn't as jarring as it seemed in Sword and the Stone but not quite as polished as it is in Jungle Book. The artwork is beautiful in the film, but it is a totally different style. The rougher lines on the drawings being exposed just comes across like their unpolished. This process worked well with this film, Jungle Book, Winnie the Pooh and 101 Dalmatians though, but after ending the traditional process with the fabulous looking Sleeping Beauty, (yes one scene used this process.. a sort of trial) these films looks very 2 dimensional and just don't seem to have the same magical look to them.OK, now about the film and video releases. I have owned both DVD releases and the new Blu Ray and all have their good points and bad points. the first release and second  editions were released in full screen so it is nice to see the film presented on the new Blu Ray is 1:66:1 which is a step in the right direction. The film feels cramped at times (not sure if 1:75:1 was the original theatrical ratio, but is what is stated in the original press book?) and once again the Blu Ray while an improvement, it shows signs of what I think are cell related issues. The films looks great in some shots and in other scenes appears soft and out of focus, then back to clear and beautiful a few frames later. I don't know if I can lay all the blame on Disney this time, but it is clear this film and many other are not receiving the same treatment films like Snow White did. It's understandable though, it wasn't hugely popular in theaters and Disney by this time was all about profit. Also, this film may not have been cared for like the early classics. Who knows how these lesser know, less successful films were stored? I don't know this film well enough to know how it should look, but this could be the problem with some scenes looking out of focus and why some dark scenes and the blacks seem to have no detail.. Still overall it looks very good and it is better than the previous releases.The direct to video sequel The Fox and the Hound 2, I'll start off by stating that I am not a collector of these direct to video sequels, so I'm not the best judge of it, I am generally not impressed with any of them and The Fox and the Hound 2 is no exception. I would rather have some quality extras and a better restoration than this sequel, but it does look great on Blu Ray.It would be nice if Disney would include multiple formats on the newer releases as the extras are thin and there is room for them. It would also let buyers have more options for playback. The restoration looks decent, but because of the style of animation and the Xerography process the rough lines seem a little too rough for my taste in some areas, although not nearly as prominent in this film.  I prefer the earlier films over the films from 1961-1981. These films seem to be missing some of Walt's magic.If you must own Disney's The Fox and the Hound, is the Blu Ray is the way to go?...probably, but there should have been more care taken to make the film more consistent and the extras are embarrassingly bad, no stills gallery again!( only on Gold edition) and not even a making of for the film! For a studio who prides themselves as pioneers in animation and the best animation at that, you would think they would put some effort into the bonus material even if it isn't there greatest achievement. The addition of the direct to video sequel is a plus for those who want it, but I would rather have had the extra care and even a short making of for the original film in place of it.  They should also have included multiple formats on the films from 1961 to 1986 because there are those films seem to have been shown in multiple formats in theaters, there is room for them on the disc so why not give fans what they complain about time and time again.",3,"THE BEST THIS FILM HAS EVER LOOKED ON HOME VIDEO, BUT THE BLU RAY IS INCONSISTENT!

It's sad how Disney chooses not to acknowledge this film much. What does it get? A stuffed animal in the Disney Store? Not even a mug, or pens. Just, recently, plush toys. It isn't like many Disney films. If you are a die hard fan of recent Disney, Disney Renaissance, and the classics, then you may not find it....to your liking. The film has some magic from Classic Disney, but, as it was in the odd years of Disney, it has that feel of a transgression for the studio.Disney brings this wonderful film to blu ray, and, as i said, Disney doesn't acknowledge the film too much. Maybe that's why is didn't get a pristine conversion, but a good one. The colors are vibrant, lines visibly drawn, but there are problems. One problem that is most easily noticed is the fact that in certain shots, the drawn lines appear blurred. Now, i don't know if this was a mistake in conversion, or if the film itself is plagued with those problems indefinitely, but they are there....and they are noticeable. The most pointed ""issue"" is a line that appears far, far right on the picture. Trust me, unless you aren't paying attention to the movie, you should barely notice this. it comes, goes, but it's barely seen if you don't look.Beside these issues, the blu ray conversion is good. Do I feel this is the best this film can look? Probably not. But this is what we have, what Disney gave us...either get it or hope for a better conversion.Now, I did not bother to watch the cheapquel. I know I won't like it, so I see no point. I wish Disney had given us the choice whether we wanted to buy it, but, alas, they didn't. Hopefully, in a later re-release they will spare us. The fact that it's name is on the cover does bother me, but the happiness that I own the original is stronger than the hate.If you are a fan, buy it; if not, maybe wait....not sure.",4,The Fox and the Hound: Underrated Disney Classic comes to good but not great blu,1324080000,"12 17, 2011",2011,1982,"['always', 'held', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'film', 'adorable', 'characters', 'were', 'too', 'much', 'take', 'was', 'great', 'tale', 'friendship', 'sad', 'how', 'Disney', 'not', 'acknowledge', 'film', 'much', 'What', 'get', 'stuffed', 'animal', 'Disney', 'Store', 'Not', 'even', 'mug', 'pens', 'Just', 'recently', 'plush', 'toys', ""n't"", 'like', 'many', 'Disney', 'films', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'recent', 'Disney', 'Disney', 'Renaissance', 'classics', 'then', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'liking', 'film', 'magic', 'Classic', 'Disney', 'was', 'odd', 'years', 'Disney', 'feel', 'transgression', 'studio.Disney', 'wonderful', 'film', 'blu', 'ray', 'i', 'said', 'Disney', ""n't"", 'acknowledge', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'Maybe', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'pristine', 'conversion', 'good', 'one', 'colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'lines', 'visibly', 'drawn', 'are', 'problems', 'One', 'problem', 'most', 'easily', 'noticed', 'fact', 'certain', 'shots', 'drawn', 'lines', 'appear', 'blurred', 'Now', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'mistake', 'conversion', 'film', 'plagued', 'problems', 'indefinitely', 'are', 'there', '.and', 'are', 'noticeable', 'most', 'pointed', 'issue', 'line', 'far', 'far', 'right', 'picture', 'Trust', 'are', ""n't"", 'paying', 'attention', 'movie', 'should', 'barely', 'notice', 'barely', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'look.Beside', 'issues', 'blu', 'ray', 'conversion', 'good', 'Do', 'feel', 'best', 'film', 'can', 'look', 'Probably', 'not', 'what', 'have', 'what', 'Disney', 'gave', 'get', 'hope', 'better', 'conversion.Now', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'watch', 'cheapquel', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'so', 'see', 'point', 'wish', 'Disney', 'had', 'given', 'choice', 'wanted', 'buy', 'alas', 'did', ""n't"", 'Hopefully', 'later', 're-release', 'will', 'spare', 'fact', 'name', 'cover', 'bother', 'happiness', 'own', 'original', 'stronger', 'hate.If', 'are', 'fan', 'buy', 'not', 'maybe', 'wait', '.not', 'sure']",N/A

1328880,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B0036TGT16,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[1, 2]","The child actors of the '80s who voiced young Tod and young Copper in Disney's The Fox and the Hound have continued their separate careers and moved in varying directions, much as their animated counterparts. I spoke with Keith Coogan--who has had a long and successful career as an adult as well as a child--about the film, his legendary grandfather and his co-star.GREG: Have you watched The Fox and the Hound over the years since its first release in the '80s?KEITH: I have probably watched it once every five years or so. This one [on Blu-ray] is just unbelievably beautiful.  Sounds great, looks terrific.  Thank you Disney for my copy.  So yeah, I have watched it over the years and always from a different kind of point of view.  Just like when you watch E.T.  First you will identify with Elliot, then you will identify with the older brother, then you identify with the mom, then you wind up identifying with Peter Coyote.  Well the same with The Fox and the Hound.  I appreciated the Sandy Duncan role as I grew older, I appreciated more of the story as I matured. And when I watch, I can forget I was even a part of it because they put it together so great and it is such a strong story. Anytime I need a good cry I would pop in The Fox and the Hound!G:  But that is a ""good"" kind of sad.  It is important for kids to learn compassion.K: Yeah.  That is such a message of the movie.  When you're a kid, you are class blind, you are color blind. That innocence is what they are layering over, and that optimism--""we will always be friends forever, won't we?""  ""Yeah, forever.""  Then it turns out not to be the case and why and that always brings a tear to my eye.G: The production was a bit bumpy according to the history books, but The Fox and the Hound is especially noted because it blended the work of veteran and new animators.K: I'm very proud to be part of a Disney classic and I love that animators and fans alike see it as a crossover picture from the old to the new. It took a while to make and they stretched the voice recording over several years. I remember seeing the ""pencil"" version of the bear attack and the waterfall.  Terrifying.  Unbelievable. They had all the sound, everything in it but they hadn't animated that sequence yet and it was still very intense, very frightening.G: Were you and Corey Feldman (who voiced Copper) already friends?K: They recorded us separate but I had known Corey Feldman and we had worked together. We were definitely cohorts and friends.  I would be done with my session and I would see him come in with his mom, maybe we had some on-set school together a little bit.G: Was doing the voice a challenge as a child actor?Not being able to act with my eyes and my body was a loss. I had never done voice over before. So the process was just they were explaining, ""Okay, these are the two birds and you are really grossed out by the worm and you say `Yeecch.'"" Some times I would just give a one-line reading, other times they would try a bunch of different options.  It was basically easy, probably three sessions total for a period of two years or so. Then when the film came out, I was just blown away.  You wouldn't have known that Corey and I weren't working together or in the same room.G: In the film, you're credited as Keith Mitchell. Did you change it to honor your grandfather, Jackie Coogan?K: My stage name is Keith Coogan. Before my grandfather passed away in 1984, my work was under Keith Mitchell, which was my birth name. When my grandfather died in 1984, I changed it to my mother's maiden name, Coogan.  I totally wanted his name to continue. You should know who Jackie Coogan was, what he did for child earnings, what he went through, his history. I wanted to honor my grandfather and also do an absolute split between my younger television work and the future film career that I was planning on at the time.G: Of course, Jackie Coogan is legendary as the first big child star, the developer of the Coogan Law to protect young performers' earnings and Uncle Fester on TV's The Addams Family. Did he talk a lot about the early days?K: We were very aware of that history of my grandfather. Hewould say things like ""I didn't meet the Pope, the Pope met me.""  Great quotes from Charlie Chaplin like ""I only had one costar and that was Jackie Coogan.""  He definitely lived in that past, he had great successes from age four.  There's a great biography of  him called Jackie Coogan: The World's First Boy King. Chaplin was absolutely responsible for establishing my grandfather's image, costume and then Jackie and my great-grandfather ran with it.  My great-grandfather turned into a producer, created Jackie Coogan Productions and did My Boy, Long Live the King and Oliver Twist. His first talkie was Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.  So, I knew about the legend really as I had grown up and I have read more and learned more. He went through so many things in his life. He married Betty Grable, fought in World War II, of course had a second career with The Addams Family.  l loved him dearly. He was the cranky, rascally old grandpa that a lot of people seem to have.G: Do you have advice for young performers today?Spend very thriftily, be wise with your money.  It doesn't last very long.  The fame comes and goes, it is very cyclical, enjoy it while it is happening, really, really, enjoy it, it is over before you know it.  You can come back, America loves a great come back story.  You might find yourself just continuing on and just working if it is something you really love to do.  If you really, really enjoy being on a set, if you really enjoy acting it is a great craft, something that calls to you, you have know choice but to do it.  But, if you are going to do it, certainly get an education to fall back because you may not ever work again and you've got to make a living.  It doesn't last forever and enjoy it while it is happening. I am very lucky to have broken into features at 16. I turned 17 on the set of Adventures in Babysitting, also for Disney. Chris Columbus was such a great director to us as kids.  He would see the story from the kids' point of view and that helps the audience see the story from the kids' point of view. Another Disney film I was very happy to do was Cheetah, which took me to Kenya and was one of the greatest times of my life.  I turned 18 on that set so just a year later.  What an unbelievable experience!G: And now you're creating your own digital film productions.K: Yes, and it's something almost anyone can do in their own way. You can write, you can produce and help other people out with their projects and friends and it is a different animal.  It is a different pace, you are shooting a lot more, you have a lot more room to improvise, still rolling, still rolling. I really like the way the industry is kind of changing.  It is miraculous and I took right to it.  A little combo of improvisation, a little combo of that classic structure of how to shoot a scene and how to do coverage but moving fast and light with digital and even 3D.  I did a 3D short.  It is really challenging but also a boon to the creative instinct. I love it.G: Do you still keep in touch with ""the hound,"" Corey Feldman?K: Yes, I love him but you do grow apart as adults.  We are not part of our daily lives. For 36 years we have worked side by side in the industry and share some of the same beginnings.  If you look at our IMDBs from the seventies they knock up against each other. So he is definitely respected by me also the only other person I could talk to who has  been through such a similar situation as myself.  He is a great one to lean on when I need to because he is the only one who understands. You look around and think there are not a lot of us left, so I don't want to lose touch with Corey ever. I have so much respect for him and I want to see more of him of course.  But you grow up. That is the theme of Fox and the Hound.  Adult situations can kind of drive some distance between you, not in the heart.Corey and I will always be friends forever.",5,"Keith Coogan (voice of ""Tod"") still loves watching the film in which he

I have always been very impressed with their Blu-ray releases. I really appreciate that they give you the DVD with just about all of them, but I am buying the Blu-ray not the DVD. The DVD is just a bonus. Disney doesn't seem to treat this classic as well as others, and it's a shame. It should be one of their most cherished. I know it is for me.-An unrelated humorous observation-I am confused as to why Disney has DVD/Blu-ray versions that come in a DVD case. Who is that for? Are there people so ashamed they have a Blu-ray player that they disguise their Blu-rays as DVDs? Maybe to match with the DVDs they already have? Isn't it their goal to get us to upgrade those too? They are the only movie company I've seen that does this. Isn't it odd?My daughter got Cars 2 DVD/Blu-ray for her birthday. She couldn't wait to see it so it got opened. Sure, it looks good next to her Cars DVD, but I intend to upgrade it to Blu-ray eventually, and I always get her the Blu-ray package.

Other than owning it in HD, fans get nothing new for what is one of the few classic feeling Disney films from this particular era. They couldn't have done a retrospective, a new featurette or had some film critic or Disney employee do a commentary? Why couldn't they have thrown together a Cine-explore. I would understand if Disney released these films again and again all the time but when you aim to only rerelease a film on new format every so many years apart you should really include something new for fans.I'm also sort of upset as a purist that I have to own the sequel, which I thought might be okay but couldn't even sit through one viewing, but I do understand this is beneficial to others and will suck it up. Still, if you're packaging two movies together to try and maximize sales you could still toss buyers a bone with a new featurette or at least a commentary.

After buying a slew of the latest Disney Blu Ray releases (Beauty and the Beast, Fantasia, Bambi, etc) I was expecting another state-of-the-art fantastic 1080p transfer.  Unfortunately, the Mouse House has not taken this title as seriously as some of the others in its vault. Instead of giving us a glorious, painstakingly perfect restoration, it would seem they opted for tossing in the insulting ""sequel"" Fox and the Hound II to make up for the slacking effort.Now I won't say it looks awful.  This Blu Ray is clearly a significant upgrade from the DVD, but it is also obviously missing the Disney touch I've come to expect.  For example, at the bottom right hand corner of the picture you will see an occasional black line flicker in and out.  Ordinarily Disney has gone in and removed these kind of print damages, through intense digital editing or by some other miraculous effort.  It is not the case for Fox and the Hound.  The black line is hardly noticeable, but once you notice it you can't stop looking at it.  It flickers in and out as it pleases, subtle at times, obnoxious at others.  A few instances it went all the way from the bottom of the picture to the top.  Nothing extreme for casual movie watchers, but for those of us who are really picky about picture presentation it can be unbearable.Colors weren't really consistent either.  At times they were bright and vivid, at others they were dingy and dark.  Blacks are overwhelming in the wrong spots, turning shadows and shading into eclipses.  Unlike the animated Alice in Wonderland, which is bright and perky, even once the forests of Wonderland get dark, Fox and the Hound looks just a little too dark even in bright sunny scenes.My overall opinion is that, while I'm glad to have an HD release of Fox and the Hound in my collection, this is not the Blu Ray I had dreamed of.  Personally I'm a little annoyed that the nasty sequel wasn't destroyed or forgotten about, much less released right alongside the classic, and I'm really disappointed that Disney didn't spend as much time as they usually do on the transfer.  For most Disney fans I doubt it'll be too much of a problem, since, like I said, 1080p certainly beats the DVD, but for those of us who are film geeks and get frustrated by imperfections, I would suggest waiting another 5 years in hopes another re-release will give this great movie the attention it deserves.",3,Not Disney's Best HD Transfer,1312588800,"08 6, 2011",2011,2527,"['Fox', 'Hound', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'mine', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'story', 'heartwarming', 'say', 'least', 'buying', 'slew', 'latest', 'Disney', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Fantasia', 'Bambi', 'etc', 'was', 'expecting', 'state-of-the-art', 'fantastic', '1080p', 'transfer', 'Unfortunately', 'Mouse', 'House', 'not', 'taken', 'title', 'as', 'seriously', 'others', 'vault', 'Instead', 'giving', 'glorious', 'painstakingly', 'perfect', 'restoration', 'would', 'seem', 'opted', 'tossing', 'insulting', 'sequel', 'Fox', 'Hound', 'II', 'make', 'up', 'slacking', 'effort.Now', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'awful', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'clearly', 'significant', 'upgrade', 'DVD', 'also', 'obviously', 'missing', 'Disney', 'touch', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'example', 'bottom', 'right', 'hand', 'corner', 'picture', 'will', 'see', 'occasional', 'black', 'line', 'flicker', 'Ordinarily', 'Disney', 'gone', 'removed', 'kind', 'print', 'damages', 'intense', 'digital', 'editing', 'other', 'miraculous', 'effort', 'not', 'case', 'Fox', 'Hound', 'black', 'line', 'hardly', 'noticeable', 'once', 'notice', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'looking', 'subtle', 'times', 'obnoxious', 'others', 'few', 'instances', 'went', 'way', 'bottom', 'picture', 'top', 'Nothing', 'extreme', 'casual', 'movie', 'watchers', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'picky', 'picture', 'presentation', 'can', 'be', 'unbearable.Colors', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'consistent', 'either', 'times', 'were', 'bright', 'vivid', 'others', 'were', 'dingy', 'dark', 'Blacks', 'are', 'overwhelming', 'wrong', 'spots', 'turning', 'shadows', 'shading', 'eclipses', 'animated', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'bright', 'perky', 'even', 'forests', 'Wonderland', 'get', 'dark', 'Fox', 'Hound', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'dark', 'even', 'bright', 'sunny', 'scenes.My', 'overall', 'opinion', ""'m"", 'glad', 'have', 'HD', 'release', 'Fox', 'Hound', 'collection', 'not', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'had', 'dreamed', 'Personally', ""'m"", 'little', 'annoyed', 'nasty', 'sequel', 'was', ""n't"", 'destroyed', 'forgotten', 'much', 'less', 'released', 'right', 'classic', ""'m"", 'really', 'disappointed', 'Disney', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'usually', 'do', 'transfer', 'most', 'Disney', 'fans', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'be', 'too', 'much', 'problem', 'said', '1080p', 'certainly', 'DVD', 'who', 'are', 'film', 'geeks', 'get', 'frustrated', 'imperfections', 'would', 'suggest', 'waiting', '5', 'years', 'hopes', 're-release', 'will', 'give', 'great', 'movie', 'attention']",N/A
