997495,A2S244KFX0745K,B000FZEU0Q,Alan Edward Creager,"[1, 3]","Beware of the Spoilers.Kevin Willmott's ""CSA: The Confederate States of America"" is an excellent film. Whether you love the Confederacy or hate it, this film, as it says, provides a fascinating and provocative look into a very different America that might have been. It is presented as a British documentary in the alternate world the movie envisions, and it is indicated early on that censorship in the CSA came close to preventing the documentary from ever being seen. In this alternate world, history diverges from how we know it just before Gettysburg, when Judah P. Benjamin succeeds in gaining the CSA military aid from Britain and France, causing Gettysburg to be a crushing defeat for the United States. The Confederacy soon invades in return, storming Washington, DC and taking the White House. President Lincoln has fled, and the primary objective of the Confederacy is now to find and capture him. Lincoln is being smuggled across the border to Canada by another enemy of the Confederate States, Harriet Tubman, when Confederate troops hunt him down. Tubman is soon hung, and though many voices are clamoring for the execution of former President Lincoln, President Jefferson Davis decides not to do so, believing that sparing him will help to mend the rift between North and South. The CSA soon annexes the USA, and goes on to take over Central and South America, creating the tropical empire that some Confederate leaders one day hoped to create. Lincoln dies lonely and bitter, exiled to Canada, and his Emancipation Proclamation is insignificant and forgotten, much as he is, in the history books. Canada becomes a defiant holdout against Confederate expansionism, swayed against deporting fleeing slaves by a powerful speech made to Canadian Parliament by Frederick Douglass. This decision begins a long, long relationship of mutual dislike between the CSA and Canada, eventually resulting in an alternate Cold War between the two nations that continues to the present day. The Confederacy does not make any separation between church and state, and ensures its status as a Christian nation by outlawing all other religions. Jews, in a totally inadequate gesture of thanks for the service of Judah P. Benjamin, are allowed to remain on reservations.The Great Depression is ended by a slavery-related act passed by the CS President, exporting large numbers of slaves overseas. When Adolf Hitler rises to power in Germany, the two nations become very friendly, with Confederate politicians attending Nazi rallies, and Hitler making a personal visit to the Confederate States. No official alliance is ever established, but the CSA promises it will make no move against Germany in any wars it has with its neighbors. World War II still ends with a German defeat- I consider that rather unrealistic, but not impossible, much as I see this film overall- but with much heavier Soviet losses. The Pacific, however, is far more different. The CSA preemptively assaults numerous Imperial Japanese bases and colonies on 12-7-1941, battling their way across the Pacific and ending the war through use of the atomic bomb. A black infantry unit is commissioned, and the soldiers who fight in it act as a massive slap in the face to prevailing Confederate views- that blacks are genetically inferior to whites and incapable of matching them in talent and intelligence- distinguish themselves under fire, going on the most dangerous missions their white officers can find and taking high losses in the process. The black soldiers were promised freedom if they served honorably, but this turns out to be a lie- the men are sent back to their owners in chains. The 1950's-1970's are troubled years, with slave rebellions, anti-slavery terrorist attacks, and an expansionist war in Vietnam. When John F. Kennedy is elected President, the first Northerner to obtain the Presidency since Lincoln, polls show that well under half of the CSA's populace favors slavery, the lowest figures in history. Women demand to be more than the property of men. Both emancipation for slaves and voting rights for women seem imminent, until Kennedy is assassinated. The CSA instead continues on its white supremacist track, keeping slaves and denying equal rights to women until the present date. Canada becomes the America we know in many ways, being vastly more popular worldwide and possessing the culture Confederate censorship makes impossible. Confederate culture never progresses beyond government-inspired propaganda.I believe this scenario to be unlikely, but not impossible. The Confederacy had relatively little interest in conquering the USA, which was on the other hand obsessed with conquering its Southern neighbor. International pressure and rising numbers of slave rebellions would have likely forced the CSA to abandon slavery long before the present date. Still, given that every alteration of history, any change to any battle, law, or war can create an entirely different world, it is quite possible that this exact scenario could have occurred. I do not believe that the Confederacy's dedication to holding slaves was so extreme. However, the film is superbly made, and whether you agree with it or not, a fascinating film that I highly recommend. As a final note, I have no idea why some have called this a satire. None.",5,"Flawed and not the best alternate history work made, but I love it anyway.",1269129600,"03 21, 2010",2010,5322,"['Beware', 'Spoilers.Kevin', 'Willmott', 'CSA', 'Confederate', 'States',

997501,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B000FZEU0Q,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[5, 8]","Which means it did its job very well.From the start, this fake-documentary puts on the masquerade, fully immersing into an alternate universe which saw Confederate Secretary of War Judah Benjamin successfully convince both France and Britain to actively intervene in the American Civil War and not only help the South win the war, but ""annex"" the entire remaining United States, creating the true Confederate States of America.Acting as a previously banned documentary from Britain airing on Confederate TV for the first time, it has commercial breaks full of fake commercials, with a Confederate twist.  From a spoof on ""Cops"" called ""Runaway"", with a wacky country music-version of ""Bad Boys"", to Mammy-based products.A faux-home shopping network broadcast, ""Slave Shopping Network"" was what made me feel genuinely revolted and sick, my stomach eased with the ""Massa Card"" joke in the corner of the screen.Another shock came with a commercial for ""Contrari"", a drug to be used on ""chattel"" to deal with the mental issue of ""Drapetomania"" (which was a real thing), playing like a typical prescription drug commercial, which ends with ""Ask your Veterinarian about CONTRARI""The sheer level of detail that went into this alternate history scenario is astounding, the likes of which are far too subtle to be appreciated without a thorough historical knowledge.  For example, the misogynist commercials and the documentary's covering of the failed Suffragettes' movement of the 1960s, caused by the lack of a solid women's rights movement early in the century, which had its roots in the abolitionist movement decades before.  And another, the Confederate invasion of Cuba is straight out of Confederate plans to ""annex"" Cuba in real life.  This event takes place parallel to the real Spanish-American War, with the sentiment of northern/southern soldiers reversed---Southerners promoting the war to heal relations with Northerners by fighting as comrades again.The way blacks are kept enslaved and constantly oppressed makes it reasonable to see the institution continuing throughout the 20th century, even up to the 2000s.  Only briefly does the thought of slavery in the 90s seem tenuous, until you realize just what has been portrayed throughout the documentary.The Confederacy depicted in this fake-documentary is the ideal of the ""Old South"" culture secessionists promoted---perfect and stagnant.  Even as technology advances and commerce and industry evolves, the Confederate mentality remains; viciously conservative and intolerant.  This ""America"" has no problem invading Central and South America and annexing them all by 1929, reopening the slave trade, making friends with Adolf Hitler, even accepting his ""Final Solution"" of the Jews and suggesting that Hitler not kill them all, but do what the Americans do---enslave them.Yet one of the most shocking/interesting moments comes with the 1960s period, with president John F. Kennedy resurrecting Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and trying to emancipate the slaves... leading to his assassination, and ""slave rebellions"" in the midst of war in Vietnam.As opposed to our history, where the social revolution of the 60s and 70s led to civil rights, women's rights, and a widespread change in our culture, this ""America""'s social revolution is violently crushed by the Confederate government using military forces on anti-war protestors.  Moving on to the 80s and 90s, this ""America"" is an ultraconservative theocracy, women don't have equal rights, and executions are broadcast live on national television.Thinking back on several elements of the documentary make it seem questionable as to whether such scenarios depicted are realistic.  Yet like I mentioned above, tracing back and realizing how the story unfolds, along with the historical subtlties and understanding of ""Old South"" mentalities makes it extremely solid speculation, though very conservative (as in, leaving out sudden cultural changes that could divert from tradition).On the physical sides, there are only a few flaws I can think of.  For one, the video quality is simply too good when depicting old movies from the 1910s, 1920s, 1940s, and so on.  ""The Jefferson Davis Story"" released 1946, is not only in full color, but the picture quality is simply too perfect to credibly pass for a 1940s picture.  And another one, ""The Dark Jungle"" released 1940, has even BETTER picture quality.  It looks more like a 1990s public access program.",5,Made me sick...,1328832000,"02 10, 2012",2012,4468,"['did', 'job', 'very', 'start', 'fake-documentary', 'masquerade', 'fully', 'immersing', 'alternate', 'universe', 'saw', 'Confederate', 'Secretary', 'War', 'Judah', 'Benjamin', 'successfully', 'convince', 'France', 'Britain', 'actively', 'intervene', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'not', 'only', 'help', 'South', 'win', 'war', 'annex', 'entire', 'remaining', 'United', 'States', 'creating', 'true', 'Confederate', 'States', 'America.Acting', 'previously', 'banned', 'documentary', 'Britain', 'airing', 'Confederate', 'TV', 'first', 'time', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'full', 'fake', 'commercials', 'Confederate', 'twist', 'spoof', 'Cops', 'called', 'Runaway', 'wacky', 'country', 'music-version', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'Mammy-based', 'products.A', 'faux-home', 'shopping', 'network', 'broadcast', 'Slave', 'Shopping', 'Network', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'feel', 'genuinely', 'revolted', 'sick', 'stomach', 'eased', 'Massa', 'Card', 'joke', 'corner', 'screen.Another', 'shock', 'came', 'commercial', 'Contrari', 'drug', 'be', 'used', 'chattel', 'deal', 'mental', 'issue', 'Drapetomania', 'was', 'real', 'thing', 'playing', 'typical', 'prescription', 'drug', 'commercial', 'Ask', 'Veterinarian', 'CONTRARI', 'sheer', 'level', 'detail', 'went', 'alternate', 'history', 'scenario', 'astounding', 'likes', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'subtle', 'be', 'appreciated', 'thorough', 'historical', 'knowledge', 'example', 'misogynist', 'commercials', 'documentary', 'covering', 'failed', 'Suffragettes', 'movement', '1960s', 'caused', 'lack', 'solid', 'women', 'rights', 'movement', 'early', 'century', 'had', 'roots', 'abolitionist', 'movement', 'decades', 'Confederate', 'invasion', 'Cuba', 'straight', 'Confederate', 'plans', 'annex', 'Cuba', 'real', 'life', 'event', 'place', 'parallel', 'real', 'Spanish-American', 'War', 'sentiment', 'northern/southern', 'soldiers', 'reversed', '-Southerners', 'promoting', 'war', 'heal', 'relations', 'Northerners', 'fighting', 'comrades', 'again.The', 'way', 'blacks', 'are', 'kept', 'enslaved', 'constantly', 'oppressed', 'reasonable', 'see', 'institution', 'continuing', '20th', 'century', 'even', '2000s', 'Only', 'briefly', 'thought', 'slavery', '90s', 'seem', 'tenuous', 'realize', 'just', 'what', 'been', 'portrayed', 'documentary.The', 'Confederacy', 'depicted', 'fake-documentary', 'ideal', 'Old', 'South', 'culture', 'promoted', '-perfect', 'stagnant', 'Even', 'technology', 'advances', 'commerce', 'industry', 'evolves', 'Confederate', 'mentality', 'viciously', 'conservative', 'intolerant', 'America', 'problem', 'invading', 'Central', 'South', 'America', 'annexing', '1929', 'reopening', 'slave', 'trade', 'making', 'friends', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'even', 'accepting', 'Final', 'Solution', 'Jews', 'suggesting', 'Hitler', 'not', 'kill', 'do', 'what', 'Americans', 'do', '-enslave', 'them.Yet', 'one', 'most', 'shocking/interesting', 'moments', '1960s', 'period', 'president', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'resurrecting', 'Lincoln', 'Emancipation', 'Proclamation', 'trying', 'emancipate', 'slaves', 'leading', 'assassination', 'slave', 'rebellions', 'midst', 'war', 'Vietnam.As', 'opposed', 'history', 'where', 'social', 'revolution', '60s', '70s', 'led', 'civil', 'rights', 'women', 'rights', 'widespread', 'change', 'culture', 'America', 'social', 'revolution', 'violently', 'crushed', 'Confederate', 'government', 'using', 'military', 'forces', 'anti-war', 'protestors', 'Moving', '80s', '90s', 'America', 'ultraconservative', 'theocracy', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'equal', 'rights', 'executions', 'are', 'broadcast', 'live', 'national', 'television.Thinking', 'back', 'several', 'elements', 'documentary', 'make', 'questionable', 'such', 'scenarios', 'depicted', 'are', 'realistic', 'mentioned', 'tracing', 'back', 'realizing', 'how', 'story', 'unfolds', 'historical', 'subtlties', 'understanding', 'Old', 'South', 'mentalities', 'extremely', 'solid', 'speculation', 'very', 'conservative', 'leaving', 'out', 'sudden', 'cultural', 'changes', 'could', 'divert', 'tradition', 'physical', 'sides', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'flaws', 'can', 'think', 'one', 'video', 'quality', 'simply', 'too', 'good', 'when', 'depicting', 'old', 'movies', '1910s', '1920s', '1940s', 'so', 'Jefferson', 'Davis', 'Story', 'released', '1946', 'not', 'only', 'full', 'color', 'picture', 'quality', 'simply', 'too', 'perfect', 'credibly', 'pass', '1940s', 'picture', 'one', 'Dark', 'Jungle', 'released', '1940', 'even', 'BETTER', 'picture', 'quality', 'more', '1990s', 'public', 'access', 'program']",N/A

Rather than crippling the national economy it and the government are prosperous enough to conquer South America, instituting ""separate but unequal"" segregation of facilities in Mexico (what really did occur in both California and Texas, sans a Confederacy), and to enslave the Chinese coolies immigrating West to build the railroads (as in life, their immigration fearfully referred to as the ""Yellow Peril""). Frederick Douglass founds the National Association for the Advancement of Chattel People. To foster ""Reconciliation"" (Reconstruction), ""Gone With The Wind"" esque romances are constructed about the romantic yet misguided Northern Cause. Slavery as the cause of the war is obscured in a haze of myth. No Northerner is elected President until the 1960's. Women are never enfranchised because Susan B. Anthony and other abolitionists fled to Canada.These facts are punctuated by commercials for products, many of which were sold in the United States at one time -- hideously racist and ugly products.

The film ends with a brief history of them, with an honorable mention of Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben.All of this causes me to wonder who other reviewers think the film is anti-Southern. Oftentimes, it takes what really occured and throws a twist, sometimes outrageous, sometimes plausible. The real focus is the prevailing racism in American society long after the war was over; there is a symmetry between this mythical Confederate reality and the reality of the United States up to the 1970's that is hard to miss.

Knowing this should be sufficient to clue us in on what to expect and to not expect.First, it's alternate history. Alternate history is extremely hard (indeed, well nigh impossible) to predict with accuracy. What CSA portrays is just one of many, many scenarios that could have played out had the South won the Civil War. (For example, given the states' rights bent of the Confederacy and the precedent that secession would have set, one plausible alternative history would include many squabbling little countries instead of a unified CSA.) I seriously doubt that it was the intent of the producers of this film to portray what they thought was the only or even the most plausible alternate outcome.Second, its intent is not to portray the Confederacy with perfect accuracy. While a more sympathetic portrayal would have been nice (including the fact that there were many in the South, including Lee and Davis, who believed slavery was a dying institution), it would have made for a rather boring movie.Third, while it may appear to some to be biased against the South and certainly does not account for the very real possibility that moral progress may have taken place even if the South had won the war, its bias is not so blatant as to detract from what this movie is--a satirical and often funny thought experiment.If the viewer is willing to take CSA as less a piece of serious social commentary than as a humorous and somewhat lighthearted look into an alternate universe that never materialized, it will provide an hour and a half of enjoyable entertainment.",4,Take it for what it's supposed to be,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,1622,"['CSA', 'Confederate', 'States', 'America', 'mockumentary', 'Knowing', 'should', 'be', 'sufficient', 'clue', 'what', 'expect', 'not', 'expect.First', 'alternate', 'history', 'Alternate', 'history', 'extremely', 'hard', 'indeed', 'well', 'nigh', 'impossible', 'predict', 'accuracy', 'What', 'CSA', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'many', 'scenarios', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'out', 'had', 'South', 'won', 'Civil', 'War', 'example', 'given', 'states', 'rights', 'bent', 'Confederacy', 'precedent', 'secession', 'would', 'have', 'set', 'one', 'plausible', 'alternative', 'history', 'would', 'include', 'many', 'squabbling', 'little', 'countries', 'instead', 'unified', 'CSA', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'was', 'intent', 'producers', 'film', 'portray', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'only', 'even', 'most', 'plausible', 'alternate', 'outcome.Second', 'intent', 'not', 'portray', 'Confederacy', 'perfect', 'accuracy', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'portrayal', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'including', 'fact', 'were', 'many', 'South', 'including', 'Lee', 'Davis', 'who', 'believed', 'slavery', 'was', 'dying', 'institution', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'rather', 'boring', 'movie.Third', 'may', 'appear', 'be', 'biased', 'South', 'certainly', 'not', 'account', 'very', 'real', 'possibility', 'moral', 'progress', 'may', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'even', 'South', 'had', 'won', 'war', 'bias', 'not', 'so', 'blatant', 'detract', 'what', 'movie', 'satirical', 'often', 'funny', 'thought', 'experiment.If', 'viewer', 'willing', 'take', 'CSA', 'less', 'piece', 'serious', 'social', 'commentary', 'humorous', 'somewhat', 'lighthearted', 'look', 'alternate', 'universe', 'never', 'materialized', 'will', 'provide', 'hour', 'half', 'enjoyable', 'entertainment']",N/A

997522,A2S1JQWKZMGFD2,B000FZEU0Q,"Durling Heath ""Durling Heath""","[13, 21]","The premise of ""CSA: The Confederate States of America"" is terrific!  Creative.  Imaginative.  Potentially, a lot of fun.  If in a parallel universe or dimension the Confederates won the Civil War, how would the 19th and 20th centuries have changed? What would life be like today?  Those are the very questions that director Kevin Willmott and producer Spike Lee attempt to answer in an ingeniously conceived, but sadly, an intellectually dishonest film.The context of ""CSA"" is a documentary film produced by the ""British Broadcasting Service"" just after the turn of the 21st century in a world in which the Confederates had won ""War of Northern Aggression"" in 1864.  The viewer watches the 89-minute film, interrupted only by the ""commercials"" which market to its parallel world audience such products as Confederate Insurance, S!mb$ Motor Oil, and D!rk#@ Toothpaste, among several others.  Interestingly, some of the mock advertisements represented products that did actually exist at one time. The film also uses every opportunity to use icons and terms to contrast the real world with the filmmakers' own construct of an alternate universe.  For example, the NAACP stands for the National Association for the Advancement of Chattel People.  There is not mention of the Berlin Wall, but rather there is a ""Cotton Wall"" erected between the CSA and Canada, where the ""John Brown Underground"" uses terrorist tactics in an attempted to bring about an end to slavery. Although not all of the acting is particularly credible, the film does provide viewers who live in this dimension a palpable creepiness as scenes of a past and contemporary segregated America using real, historical film footage and photographs are flashed on the television screen.As inventive and clever the film's delivery is, however, the unlikelihood of the events that unfolded on screen are difficult to conceive, not only for a student of American history, but also for the average viewer.  The Confederacy won the war, suggest the film's writers, because CSA Secretary of State Judah Benjamin was able to secure the support of England and France against the Union.  (Had England and France joined the war, it is possible and likely that the Confederacy would have been victorious.)  Just as the ""real"" Abraham Lincoln had in fact waited for a decisive victory for the Union to announce the Emancipation Proclamation, the CSA wanted to wait for a Confederate victory in battle before securing the support of the two European superpowers of the 19th century.  That decisive victory did not come at the right time for the Jefferson Davis government.However, in the alternate universe after Grant surrendered to Lee, Abraham Lincoln was forced to enlist Harriett Tubman and her Underground Railroad to assist the cowardly Lincoln away from Washington D.C. and to safety.  The two are captured, Lincoln, disguised in blackface, and Tubman is eventually hanged while Lincoln looks through his small, barred cell window.  Willmott continues to suggest a bigoted and angry South as Confederate soldiers continue to march northward to burn both New York City and Boston to the ground.  These acts of wanton destruction, then, required ""Reconstruction"" in the North overseen by the Confederate States' government, now secure in Washington D.C.  The Reconstruction included, in part, the choice of Northerners to either pay a high Reconstruction tax or to get-with-the-program by purchasing a slave.  In contrast, the real-life Lincoln simply allowed Jefferson Davis and to leave the Confederate capital after the fighting had ceased and permitted, for the most part, Confederate soldiers to peacefully return home to their farms and businesses.The film continues to move further away from a likely historical scenario toward barefaced liberal, and even race-baiting propaganda as the alternate reality Confederate States of America enslave Chinese, American Indians, and Japanese during expansion to the American West and during the Industrial Revolution.  In addition, the C.S.A. annexes all of South America and supports and reveres Adolph Hitler for his ideas and ideals relating to a pure Arian race in Europe.  Willmott even discretely makes the point that Abraham Lincoln was not actually an abolitionist himself to denigrate the extraordinary accomplishments and leadership of the Kentuckian during the most difficult time in our nation's history.  While it is arguable and would certainly not have correlated with the film makers' message, the more likely and more intellectually sincere outcome of a Confederate victory would have been a separate Confederate States of America in the South along with a United States of America in the North.  And, as like every civilized country in the world has done, the CSA would likely have successfully found a solution to end slavery, as well.In short, what could have been a historically interesting, fun, and groundbreaking film that still could possibly have made some important points about people, politics, and opinions in America, devolved into something else.  The suggestion that Americans from southern states were (and may continue to be) ignorant racists is offensive.  The subtle implication that widespread stereotyping lies just below the surface propagates distrust between Americans is as disturbing as it is counterproductive.  Fortunately, and in spite of  ""CSA: The Confederate States of America"" bordering on racism, the United States of America is, in fact, a place where citizens are free to express their opinion through a right of free speech.",2,"Ingeniously conceived, but sadly, an intellectually dishonest film",1199923200,"01 10, 2008",2008,5581,"['premise', 'CSA', 'Confederate', 'States', 'America', 'terrific',

997523,AXO4PQU0XG3TG,B000FZEU0Q,Dwight,"[2, 5]","yeah, probably misleading because the voice of opposition is British - the British were instrumental in sending kidnapped Africans to the Americas.Lincoln did not need to be more explicit - he was declaring war on someone else's MONEY - think the drug trade - and WHY did he attach it to saving the country?because slavery like drugs is a cheat- it cheats to have more money than everyone else who isn't involved in the dirty business and it makes them eventually your slaves - its beat cops being disrespected by young Wall Streeters who make at least ten times as much as the law.  It eventually reaches the point when it can buy and own the rest of us.Why?  because if you can't beat the American REBELS on the battlefield, you can beat them economically but you need to enslave Black people to do it and put your operatives on plantations running the show - not just in the South but the Caribbean and South America and that is why Americans do not speak in a British accent, we don't drive on the same side of the road, we don't spell the same and we don't pronounce our words the same.  We go our own way.And this film is NOT a comedy so the audience should realize that this film is not about holding the English above us as morally superior when George Bernard Shaw is quoted:""If you're going to tell people the truth,  better make them laugh: otherwise they will kill you.""which would explain this:The Snukefrom the abolition project site:British traders supplied slaves for the Spanish and Portuguese colonists in America. However, as British settlements in the Caribbean and North America grew, often through wars with European countries such as Holland, Spain and France, British slave traders increasingly supplied British coloniesThe exact number of British ships that took part in the Slave Trade will probably never be known but, in the 245 years between Hawkins first voyage and the abolition of the Slave Trade in 1807, merchants in Britain despatched about 10,000 voyages to Africa for slaves, with merchants in other parts of the British Empire perhaps fitting out a further 1,150 voyages.Historian, Professor David Richardson, has calculated that British ships carried 3.4 million or more enslaved Africans to the Americas.Only the Portuguese, who carried on the trade for almost 50 years after Britain had abolished its Slave Trade, carried more enslaved Africans to the Americas than the British (the most recent estimate suggests just over 5 million people).Estimates, based on records of voyages in the archives of port customs and maritime insurance records, put the total number of African slaves  transported by European traders, to at least 12 million people.The first record of enslaved Africans being landed in the British colony of Virginia was in 1619. Barbados became the first British settlement in the Caribbean in 1625 and the British took control of Jamaica in 1655.The establishment of the Royal African Company in 1672 formalised the Slave Trade under a royal charter and gave a monopoly to the port of London. The ports of Bristol and Liverpool, in particular, lobbied to have the charter changed and, in 1698, the monopoly was taken away.British involvement expanded rapidly in response to the demand for labour to cultivate sugar in Barbados and other British West Indian islands. In the 1660s, the number of slaves taken from Africa in British ships averaged 6,700 per year. By the 1760s, Britain was the foremost European country engaged in the Slave Trade. Of the 80,000 Africans chained and shackled and transported across to the Americas each year, 42,000 were carried by British slave ships.The profits gained from chattel slavery helped to finance the Industrial Revolution and the Caribbean islands became the hub of the British Empire. The sugar colonies were Britain's most valuable colonies. By the end of the eighteenth century, four million pounds came into Britain from its West Indian plantations, compared with one million from the rest of the world.Who benefited from the Transatlantic Slave Trade?In the Transatlantic Slave Trade, triangle ships never sailed empty and some people made enormous profits.  This Slave Trade was the richest part of Britain's trade in the 18th century. James Houston, who worked for a firm of 18th-century slave merchants, wrote, ""What a glorious and advantageous trade this is... It is the hinge on which all the trade of this globe moves.""Between 1750 and 1780, about 70% of the government's total income came from taxes on goods from its colonies. The money made on the Transatlantic Slave Trade triangle was vast and poured into Britain and other European countries involved in slavery, changing their landscapes forever. In Britain, those who had made much of their wealth from the trade built fine mansions, established banks such as the Bank of England and funded new industries.Who profited?British slave ship owners - some voyages made 20-50% profit. Large sums of money were made by ship owners who never left England.British Slave Traders - who bought and sold enslaved Africans.Plantation Owners - who used slave labour to grow their crops. Vast profits could be made by using unpaid workers. Planters often retired to Britain with the profits they made and had grand country houses built for them. Some planters used the money they had made to become MPs. Others invested their profits in new factories and inventions, helping to finance the Industrial Revolution.The factory owners in Britain - who had a market for their goods. Textiles from Yorkshire and Lancashire were bought by slave-captains to barter with. One half of the textiles produced in Manchester were exported to Africa and half to the West Indies. In addition, industrial plants were built to refine the imported raw sugar. Glassware was needed to bottle the rum.West African leaders involved in the trade - who captured people and sold them as slaves to Europeans.The ports - Bristol and Liverpool became major ports through fitting out slave ships and handling the cargoes they brought back. Between 1700 and 1800, Liverpool's population rose from 5000 to 78,000.Bankers - banks and finance houses grew rich from the fees and interest they earned from merchants who borrowed money for their long voyages.Ordinary people - the Transatlantic Slave Trade provided many jobs for people back in Britain. Many people worked in factories which sold their goods to West Africa. These goods would then be traded for enslaved Africans. Birmingham had over 4000 gun-makers, with 100,000 guns a year going to slave-traders.Others worked in factories that had been set up with money made from the Slave Trade. Many trades-people bought a share in a slave ship. Slave labour also made goods, such as sugar, more affordable for people living in Britain.ETA:  America is the reason that everyone all over the world is USED to Black People - they don't feel foreign to us.  It's not Richard Curtis films that did that.  It's not Canadian media or anybody else.  France may have been welcoming to the entertainers like Josephine Baker but they still colonized Africa and Asia.  Just remember that Michael Jackson, Michael Jordan, Eddie Murphy and Wesley Snipes are American.  It's not an ENLIGHTENED Europe thing.That stuff with Glencore in Zambia, the interference in the governments in Africa, SOUTH AFRICA and the dress rehearsal to the Holocaust in Namibia - ALL EUROPEANS.  The more alien, the more cut off from the rest of the world - the EASIER they are to kill - and that would be Africa if not for America and Hollywood and the music industry and the NBA.  Without that, Africa's exploitation would go unreported EXACTLY like the invasion and subsequent erasure of Corea by Japan - because no one knew where or what was Corea - there wasn't timely outrage - they felt too remote - hopefully, that is no longer the case with Hallyu (Korean Wave) and Gangnam Style.",3,George Washington from England owned slaves and is related to Princess Diana,1383955200,"11

Pouliot,"[2, 6]","The ""what if"" game popular among intellectual hopefuls comes to the screen in this reflection on how the USA  -- ahem, the CSA! - would have developed had the South won the War between the States. Presented as a British documentary detailing the history of America, the film puts archival film to new uses and creates new, period-accurate material to tell its story. Starting with a Southern win at Gettysburg - with British and French assistance - the Confederacy goes from strength to strength until it occupies Washington, DC and puts Jeff Davis in the White House. In a D.W. Griffith-esque silent film - a parody of ""The Birth of a Nation"" -- the new government hunts down ""Dishonest Abe"" Lincoln, who had been fleeing to Canada in the company of Harriet Tubman. The CSA legalizes slavery in all states. It sits out the war with equally racist Nazi Germany, and finds itself at odds with slavery-abolishing Canada, where much of the black American intelligentsia has fled.Interestingly, much of American history went on unchanged. Wilbur and Orville still flew at Kitty Hawk and Americans still walked on the moon (albeit after hoisting the Stars and Bars, rather than the Stars and Stripes). But as many of the film's mock commercials indicate, life for blacks barely changed. Indeed the film opens with a commercial for life insurance to protect a white man's family and (panning to a black man trimming the hedges) his property.""The Confederates States of America"" is a cleverly made, often funny, and inspired piece of imagination. It suggests that a paranoid, male-dominated, slave-oppressing and culturally-impoverished America -- think of a north-of-the-equator version of apartheid South Africa -- would have been the result of a win by the South. Given the century of struggle that it took blacks to win full rights even WITH a Northern victory, and the important tie between slave freedom and women's suffrage, these conclusions are not far-fetched. The film's small touches were perfect and eay to miss. A speaker is labeled the author of ""The Gray and the Blue,"" neatly placing the victor's colors foremost. The secession of Southern states was never mentioned -- rather, Jeff Davis established a ""provisional government"" in response to Lincoln's electoral victory. Paintings of Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox worked as well when described as depicting Grant's surrender to Lee. Tye real-life Watts riots were recast as a slave rebellion. A real JFK Cold War speech about slavery and freedom under Communism sounded in ""CSA"" like a call to emancipate America's still-enslaved blacks.I gently object to the film being labeled a mockumentary. ""This is Spinal Tap!"" and ""A Mighty Wind"" made fun of their subjects, even while celebrating them. But the subject of ""CSA""  is no laughing matter. It's not clear that America could have continued as a slave-holding nation had the South won the war. But the film did make me think again about those who, even today, see the Civil War as a simple misunderstanding between (white) gentlemen about states rights.

Fast forward to the present, and we are the privileged viewers of a British-made ""documentary"" about the ensuing course of events.  The results follow an insane logic that is stark, Swiftian and deeply, deeply disturbing.Another reviewer has pointed out that the film is an amazing indictment of slavery, although it may not be convincing as a speculative history.  I wholeheartedly agree on this point.  Putting aside the film's plausibility or lack thereof, the viewer can be in no doubt about the film's views on slavery and racism.  I am very impressed by the audacity of the writers and film makers, to present an obviously divisive subject in such a bald-faced fashion, or to the inhuman ends it might lead.  Personally, I did not find the outcomes here implausible, if one is willing to follow the logic to its awful conclusion.  Rather, it convinced me further still that to look at people as objects in any way, shape or form will ultimately rob everyone of their humanity.The film has obviously generated a lot of diverse feeling, as the spectrum of reviews on this site attest.  I personally did not find the film funny or amusing past the first 5 minutes.  Anything that might have been seen in a humorous light got swept under a wave of terrified nausea by the offensive, curious logic of the film's premise.  This is all to the film's credit, as shock value is the driving force here.  On the down side, the acting and production values are no better than a run-of-the-mill '70's TV show headed for cancellation.  Hence the 4 stars.I did not get the impression that the film was necessarily a polemic against antebellum Southern culture, despite the obvious and unavoidable connections.

The Confederate Constitution explicitly protected the institution of slavery:Article I Section 9(4)No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed.Article IV Section 2(1)The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States; and shall have the right of transit and sojourn in any State of this Confederacy, with their slaves and other property; and the right of property in said slaves shall not be thereby impaired.It also ensured the spread of slavery into new territories:Article IV Section 3(3)The Confederate States may acquire new territory; and Congress shall have power to legislate and provide governments for the inhabitants of all territory belonging to the Confederate States, lying without the limits of the several states; and may permit them, at such times, and in such manner as it may by law provide, to form states to be admitted into the Confederacy. In all such territory, the institution of negro slavery as it now exists in the Confederate States, shall be recognized and protected by Congress, and by the territorial government: and the inhabitants of the several Confederate States and Territories, shall have the right to take to such territory any slaves lawfully held by them in any of the states or territories of the Confederate states.This proves that anyone who claims that the Civil War was not, at its core, about slavery, is a liar and a fraud. The entire economy of the South was dependent on slavery. The spark for secession was Lincoln's intention to prohibit both slavery and black settlement in the new western territories, with the inevitable outcome that poor southern whites would have emigrated, leaving the plantation owners alone with no protection from a slave rebellion. The &#34;Bleeding Kansas&#34; controversy demonstrated the deep conflict over whether slavery would be allowed in the new western states.How all of this would have played out given a Confederate victory is pure speculation, and the filmmakers, to underscore their point, assume the most extreme outcome, where slavery ultimately spreads worldwide. Its presentation in the form of a documentary intended to aquaint foreign viewers with an essential episode in American history allows the film to give clear, simple explanations that American (Confederate?) viewers presumably would have been well aware of.I was initially put off by the apparent outrageousness of the &#34;commercials,&#34; supposedly for products only available in the alternate reality of the film's world, until the one for &#34;Coon Chicken,&#34; which I was already familiar with, the logo having been used by a character on the HBO series &#34;Six Feet Under&#34; for an art project. People complain about political correctness, but there's something to be said for not deliberately going out of your way to insult an entire race.

However, the movie can occasionally be a little far-fetched, goofy, or can leave gaps in the storyline... but hey, this is ""what if"" history, and is therefore fiction--albeit fiction based on fact and intelligent, retroactive historical projections. The creative slant in this potential historical trajectory of a C.S.A. is entertaining, but at times a bit goofy or over the top (probably in an effort to keep your attention, although it has the potential to have the opposite effect on serious viewers). When it comes down to it, no matter your political inclinations, this film is very intellectually stimulating, and offers quite a few laughs. Just make sure to watch it twice. Watch the film the whole way through and then re-watch it with the director's commentary on the reality behind the fiction. Truly, the commentary (and related arguments for the basis of the film's creative choices) could change your feelings about this movie.

997553,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B000FZEU0Q,Marshall Lord,"[5, 9]","This film sets out to make the viewer realise how much evil was caused by slavery, presenting itself as a documentary being made in an ""alternative history"" world in which the South won the American civil war and slavery continues to this day.The mechanics of how history came to follow an alternative track are deliberately downplayed: this film is not really about how any specific change in the timeline could have produced particular consequences. The fact that in a few instances the alternate history timeline is very implausible does not matter to this film, where it might have ruined a different type of film in which the history was the story.For instance, it is one thing to suggest that the Confederate States of America might have won independence if they could get British and French support. It is an entirely different matter to suggest that the rebels could have actually conquered and annexed the North. If the main message of the film had been that this could have happened it would have completely destroyed the credibility of the story. However, as the main purpose of the story is to make the evil of slavery real to us by showing how it would have worked in a modern context, the makers of the film can plausibly argue that they more effectively make that point by showing slavery in action throughout the area which in our world is the United States of America and in the film is the Confederate States of America.The opening sequence starts with a disclaimer that this is a ""foreign"" documentary made by the ""British Broadcasting Service"" (which doesn't exist) - this is part of the scene setting. The film is interspersed with adverts for various services and products set in a world in which slavery is normal and both racism and sexism are much more overt and direct than we are used to seeing. At the very end of the film there is an explanation of how much of this advertising is lifted from real adverts for real products, which will shock many people.Part of the film is presented as a history programme about the ""Confederate States"" and part as an expose of the supposed current social and political situation.The film loves taking real events and reversing them: for example the real painting of the surrender at the end of the civil war is described as Grant's surrender to Lee, we see film of the TV debate in the US presidential election of 1960, and it is described as being between Democrat candidate Richard Nixon and Republican candidate John F Kennedy.This year, 2007, sees the 200th anniversary of the vote by the British parliament to abolish the slave trade. Many organisations including the Anglican (Episcopal) church and my local council in Copeland (which includes Whitehaven) are marking this by organising ceremonies to apologise for their role in slavery.It's easy to get cynical about this, especially while we have a Prime Minister who is constantly apologising for things which Britain did centuries ago but who has never once apologised for any of the things for which he is actually responsible. However, if I had been in any doubt that we should express our regrets and apology for the fact that our ancestors were once involved in the slave trade - and on the positive side, that anyone with ancestors who helped to stop the slave trade and bring emancipation can be proud of the fact - this film would have dispelled it.",4,Devastating critique of slavery,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,3381,"['film', 'out', 'make', 'viewer', 'realise', 'how', 'much', 'evil', 'was', 'caused', 'slavery', 'presenting', 'documentary', 'being', 'made', 'alternative', 'history', 'world', 'South', 'won', 'American', 'civil', 'war', 'slavery', 'day.The', 'mechanics', 'how', 'history', 'came', 'follow', 'alternative', 'track', 'are', 'deliberately', 'downplayed', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'how', 'specific', 'change', 'timeline', 'could', 'have', 'produced', 'particular', 'consequences', 'fact', 'few', 'instances', 'alternate', 'history', 'timeline', 'very', 'implausible', 'not', 'matter', 'film', 'where', 'might', 'have', 'ruined', 'different', 'type', 'film', 'history', 'was', 'story.For', 'instance', 'one', 'thing', 'suggest', 'Confederate', 'States', 'America', 'might', 'have', 'won', 'independence', 'could', 'get', 'British', 'French', 'support', 'entirely', 'different', 'matter', 'suggest', 'rebels', 'could', 'have', 'actually', 'conquered', 'annexed', 'North', 'main', 'message', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'would', 'have', 'completely', 'destroyed', 'credibility', 'story', 'However', 'main', 'purpose', 'story', 'make', 'evil', 'slavery', 'real', 'showing', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'modern', 'context', 'makers', 'film', 'can', 'plausibly', 'argue', 'more', 'effectively', 'make', 'point', 'showing', 'slavery', 'action', 'area', 'world', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'film', 'Confederate', 'States', 'America.The', 'opening', 'sequence', 'disclaimer', 'foreign', 'documentary', 'made', 'British', 'Broadcasting', 'Service', ""n't"", 'exist', 'part', 'scene', 'setting', 'film', 'interspersed', 'adverts', 'various', 'services', 'products', 'set', 'world', 'slavery', 'normal', 'racism', 'sexism', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'overt', 'direct', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'explanation', 'how', 'much', 'advertising', 'lifted', 'real', 'adverts', 'real', 'products', 'will', 'shock', 'many', 'people.Part', 'film', 'presented', 'history', 'programme', 'Confederate', 'States', 'part', 'expose', 'supposed', 'current', 'social', 'political', 'situation.The', 'film', 'taking', 'real', 'events', 'reversing', 'example', 'real', 'painting', 'surrender', 'end', 'civil', 'war', 'described', 'Grant', 'surrender', 'Lee', 'see', 'film', 'TV', 'debate', 'US', 'presidential', 'election', '1960', 'described', 'being', 'Democrat', 'candidate', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'Republican', 'candidate', 'John', 'F', 'Kennedy.This', 'year', '2007', '200th', 'anniversary', 'vote', 'British', 'parliament', 'abolish', 'slave', 'trade', 'Many', 'organisations', 'including', 'Anglican', 'Episcopal', 'church', 'local', 'council', 'Copeland', 'Whitehaven', 'are', 'marking', 'organising', 'ceremonies', 'apologise', 'role', 'slavery.It', 'easy', 'get', 'cynical', 'especially', 'have', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'who', 'constantly', 'apologising', 'things', 'Britain', 'did', 'centuries', 'ago', 'who', 'never', 'once', 'apologised', 'things', 'actually', 'responsible', 'However', 'had', 'been', 'doubt', 'should', 'express', 'regrets', 'apology', 'fact', 'ancestors', 'were', 'once', 'involved', 'slave', 'trade', 'positive', 'side', 'anyone', 'ancestors', 'who', 'helped', 'stop', 'slave', 'trade', 'bring', 'emancipation', 'can', 'be', 'proud', 'fact', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'dispelled']",N/A
997554,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000FZEU0Q,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[22, 40]","Yes, [...] CSA is a film within a film. CSA presents the hypothetical history of America if the Confederate States of America (the pro-slavery South) had won the American Civil War. Although there are a few amusing moments, the point of the film is to spotlight the negative effects and crudeness of socially accepted racism mostly against African Americans but also against Jews, Asians, Native Americans and anyone else who isn't ""Aryan"" white. The results are striking and memorable.Operating within the framework of being a British documentary on the history of the Confederate States of America from the years just before the Civil War to the present, CSA dissects the obvious injustices of slavery, racism and anti-Semitism. It even goes so far as to compare the racist ""lily white"" CSA to the ""ethnic cleansing"" policies against the Jews by the government of the greatest evildoer of them all, Hitler. Specifically, during World War II the CSA stays neutral in the European circuit--but the CSA rails against the evil Japanese by bombing them on December 7, 1941. Of course the CSA had no choice but to bomb Japan because Japanese people look ""different"" than white people.Sure, [...] the history of the CSA presented in this film has gaps and inconsistencies. It does. But that's not the point. Instead, the movie strives to satirize the horrors of what may well have actually happened if indeed the CSA had won the American Civil War. For example, the leaders of the CSA actually DID have plans to conquer all of South America and socially acceptable racism was evident in racial slurs like ""darky"" and brand names that were not exactly too respectful of black people.I mentioned that CSA is presented as a TV documentary produced by the British. At first some of the ""TV commercials"" appeared mildly amusing (at least to me they did) because they are so different from the way I think and look at the world. However, at the end of the film I was treated to the disgusting revelation that there really WERE such commonly used products for sale as Sam** motor oil and N****rhair cigarettes. C**n Chicken franchises existed, too. Oh, man, I don't care at all if this sounds corny; but I feel so sorry that black people had to go through that torture--in subtle ways, they still do.CSA represents an important opportunity for its viewers to become better educated about the lesser known horrors of racism in all its forms, not just against African Americans over time. The CSA kicks out almost all of the Jews because it is a ""Christian"" country and uses Chinese immigrants as mindless slaves for free slave labor in California. Indeed, the film so drastically mocks racism that at times you don't know whether you should laugh or cry. There is an ""in your face"" approach used so keep that in mind when choosing if you want to watch this film.The DVD has some great plusses: deleted scenes, interviews with the filmmakers and commentaries as well. The actors were not especially famous but they did a fantastic and very convincing performance. CSA held my attention and I highly recommend this movie for people who want to think critically about racism and prejudice, ignorance and political propaganda. This is one of the best films I have seen; and sadly the message and the lessons of CSA will probably remain extremely important for quite some while to come.",5,A not too subtle issue still haunting mankind today...,1157328000,"09 4, 2006",2006,3368,"['Yes', '[', ']', 'CSA', 'film', 'film', 'CSA', 'hypothetical', 'history', 'America', 'Confederate', 'States', 'America', 'pro-slavery', 'South', 'had', 'won', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'are', 'few', 'amusing', 'moments', 'point', 'film', 'spotlight', 'negative', 'effects', 'crudeness', 'socially', 'accepted', 'racism', 'mostly', 'African', 'Americans', 'also', 'Jews', 'Asians', 'Native', 'Americans', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', ""n't"", 'Aryan', 'white', 'results', 'are', 'striking', 'memorable.Operating', 'framework', 'being', 'British', 'documentary', 'history', 'Confederate', 'States', 'America', 'years', 'just', 'Civil', 'War', 'present', 'CSA', 'obvious', 'injustices', 'slavery', 'racism', 'anti-Semitism', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'compare', 'racist', 'lily', 'white', 'CSA', 'ethnic', 'cleansing', 'policies', 'Jews', 'government', 'greatest', 'evildoer', 'Hitler', 'Specifically', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'CSA', 'neutral', 'European', 'circuit', 'CSA', 'rails', 'evil', 'Japanese', 'bombing', 'December', '7', '1941', 'course', 'CSA', 'had', 'choice', 'bomb', 'Japan', 'Japanese', 'people', 'look', 'different', 'white', 'people.Sure', '[', 'history', 'CSA', 'presented', 'film', 'gaps', 'inconsistencies', 'not', 'point', 'Instead', 'movie', 'satirize', 'horrors', 'what', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'actually', 'happened', 'indeed', 'CSA', 'had', 'won', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'example', 'leaders', 'CSA', 'actually', 'DID', 'have', 'plans', 'conquer', 'South', 'America', 'socially', 'acceptable', 'racism', 'was', 'evident', 'racial', 'slurs', 'darky', 'brand', 'names', 'were', 'not', 'exactly', 'too', 'respectful', 'black', 'people.I', 'mentioned', 'CSA', 'presented', 'TV', 'documentary', 'produced', 'British', 'first', 'TV', 'commercials', 'appeared', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'least', 'did', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'way', 'think', 'look', 'world', 'However', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'treated', 'disgusting', 'revelation', 'really', 'WERE', 'such', 'commonly', 'used', 'products', 'sale', 'Sam**', 'motor', 'oil', 'N****rhair', 'cigarettes', 'C**n', 'Chicken', 'existed', 'too', 'Oh', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'corny', 'feel', 'so', 'sorry', 'black', 'people', 'had', 'go', 'torture', 'subtle', 'ways', 'still', 'do.CSA', 'important', 'opportunity', 'viewers', 'become', 'better', 'educated', 'lesser', 'known', 'horrors', 'racism', 'forms', 'not', 'just', 'African', 'Americans', 'time', 'CSA', 'out', 'almost', 'Jews', 'Christian', 'country', 'Chinese', 'immigrants', 'mindless', 'slaves', 'free', 'slave', 'labor', 'California', 'Indeed', 'film', 'so', 'drastically', 'racism', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'should', 'laugh', 'cry', 'face', 'approach', 'used', 'so', 'keep', 'mind', 'when', 'choosing', 'want', 'watch', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'great', 'plusses', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'interviews', 'filmmakers', 'commentaries', 'as', 'well', 'actors', 'were', 'not', 'especially', 'famous', 'did', 'fantastic', 'very', 'convincing', 'performance', 'CSA', 'held', 'attention', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'think', 'critically', 'racism', 'prejudice', 'ignorance', 'political', 'propaganda', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'sadly', 'message', 'lessons', 'CSA', 'will', 'probably', 'remain', 'extremely', 'important', 'quite', 'come']",N/A

Slavery was not on the way out at the start of the Civil War, but being strengthened by men like John C. Calhoun who thought of slavery as a positive good for the African. As mentioned in the movie, it didn't matter whether or not it was economically viable - the importance was social control, something that happened in the South after the troops left in 1876.The part concerning the annexation of the North was also feasible. In his book on the writing of the CSA constitution, William Davis states that there as a lot of discussion of what to do if any of the Northern states saw the wisdom of the CSA constitution and wanted to join the Confederacy.  The abolition of slavery in NY was a difficult process which can be seen in the attitudes of President Tyler's New York born wife Julia Gardiner whose family lost its slaves to abolitionIt was very interesting to see the other aspects of Southern ""thought"". The scene with the wife whose lazy sloppy husband is lying on the couch but she talks of how she must obey him. The banning of all but ""Christian"" people from America except for a Jewish enclave on Long Island is telling. The broader racism including Asians and Indians adds depth. The ending showing the rationale for some of the ""commercials"" and how they really did exist is striking.Spike Lee also hits the nail on the head with the scenes about the reconciliation of north and south among the veterans and the concept of the ""Lost Cause"" and valor of the opposing soldiers. This really did happen and the African veterans were shut out and Mr. Lincoln's crusade against slavery was forgotten.What is frightening is that these attitudes and beliefs still exist today; maybe not as blatantly as depicted here, but they are there especially among those who call themselves ""Republicans"" (and in reality Dixiecrats) but who are light years from the thoughts of our greatest president.",5,More than just slavery,1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,1966,"['Spike', 'Lee', 'keen', 'insight', 'Southern', 'American', 'attitudes', 'Slavery', 'was', 'not', 'way', 'start', 'Civil', 'War', 'being', 'strengthened', 'men', 'John', 'C.', 'Calhoun', 'who', 'thought', 'slavery', 'positive', 'good', 'African', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'not', 'was', 'economically', 'viable', 'importance', 'was', 'social', 'control', 'something', 'happened', 'South', 'troops', 'left', '1876.The', 'part', 'concerning', 'annexation', 'North', 'was', 'also', 'feasible', 'book', 'writing', 'CSA', 'constitution', 'William', 'Davis', 'lot', 'discussion', 'what', 'do', 'Northern', 'states', 'saw', 'wisdom', 'CSA', 'constitution', 'wanted', 'join', 'Confederacy', 'abolition', 'slavery', 'NY', 'was', 'difficult', 'process', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'attitudes', 'President', 'Tyler', 'New', 'York', 'born', 'wife', 'Julia', 'Gardiner', 'family', 'lost', 'slaves', 'abolitionIt', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'see', 'other', 'aspects', 'Southern', 'thought', 'scene', 'wife', 'lazy', 'sloppy', 'husband', 'lying', 'couch', 'talks', 'how', 'must', 'obey', 'banning', 'Christian', 'people', 'America', 'Jewish', 'enclave', 'Long', 'Island', 'telling', 'broader', 'racism', 'including', 'Asians', 'Indians', 'depth', 'ending', 'showing', 'rationale', 'commercials', 'how', 'really', 'did', 'exist', 'striking.Spike', 'Lee', 'also', 'nail', 'head', 'scenes', 'reconciliation', 'north', 'south', 'veterans', 'concept', 'Lost', 'Cause', 'valor', 'opposing', 'soldiers', 'really', 'did', 'happen', 'African', 'veterans', 'were', 'shut', 'out', 'Mr.', 'Lincoln', 'crusade', 'slavery', 'was', 'forgotten.What', 'frightening', 'attitudes', 'beliefs', 'still', 'exist', 'today', 'maybe', 'not', 'as', 'blatantly', 'depicted', 'here', 'are', 'there', 'especially', 'who', 'call', 'Republicans', 'reality', 'Dixiecrats', 'who', 'are', 'light', 'years', 'thoughts', 'greatest', 'president']",N/A

Many in the North and South had already recognized that slavery was becoming more and more financially untenable and many prominent Southerners were opposed to slavery (such as Robert E. Lee) and there is simply no possible way that the South could have won the Civil War (Lee hoped that the North would become weary of fighting and just leave the South alone - no one in the South thought that they could actually defeat the North).  But none of this matters.  This is a comic look at American History with the aim of mining an alternative American history for any potential humor.  In this regard the documentary is a huge success.  The film really doesn't make many deep political points.  It just tries to generate laughs by a parody of American History.The film is structured as a British documentary that is being shown in America, thus allowing the inclusion of Confederate States of America commercials.  There are some delightful twists, such as Canada developing as an enemy as dangerous as the Soviet Union, due to the nation's views on slavery.  The commercials are funny and actually quite on target if you are familiar with racially edged commercials from the late 19th century.  I also enjoyed the twists on world history, with the CSA taking a different relationship with countries like Nazi Germany (advocating that Germany enslave the Jews rather than kill them) and the conceit that writers like Richard Wright and James Baldwin would be Canadian writers.

The film begins with a commercial about insurance.  It is one of many faux television advertisements scattered throughout the picture.  After the insurance commercial, there is a warning that the following film might offend some people.  Then the actual ""broadcast"" presentation of C.S.A. begins.  In the world of the film, the South wins Gettysburg and because of that Judah P. Benjamin successfully convinces not only England, but also France that the real issue of the war isn't slavery, but states' rights and they join the Rebel grey on the battlefield.  The Union had more than enough troops to outfight the Confederacy alone, but not enough to fight the armies of two other countries.  Lee marches on Washington, D.C. and other Confederate generals pillage and burn Boston and New York.  Meanwhile, President Lincoln is forced to flee, but is caught with Harriet Tubman just south of the Canadian border disguised in blackface.  Tubman is hanged and Lincoln is imprisoned for two years at Fortress Monroe.  Upon his release Lincoln moves to Canada and lives out his life there.  Emboldened by their victory the Confederacy begins a different form of Reconstruction, offering to rebuild the destroyed Northern cities with ""free"" slave labor.  There are rebellions here and there, but they are quickly put down and those who dissent are executed.  A huge number of abolitionists, scholars, and religious leaders leave the Confederacy for Canada.  Western expansion is continued and the Native Indians are either exterminated or forced to flee to Canada, too.  There are no Indian reservations in this alternative timeline. Chinese workers in the west are made slaves, too.  Emboldened by their successes, the Confederacy sets it sights on a world empire and begins a war into Central and then South America.  The expansion succeeds, though at a great cost, and by the early part of the 20th Century all of South America is a part of the Confederate States of America.  The Confederacy stays out of the European field of WWII, but fights alone against Japan.  Seeking to slay the dragon before it can strike, the C.S.A. attacks Japan.  The war is long and bloody, but the development of the atomic bomb brings the surrender of the Japanese empire.  The 1950s bring a time of peace and prosperity to the nation-empire, but the 1960s bring distress.  John F. Kennedy defeats Richard Nixon for the Presidency and his election brings the hope for woman's suffrage and the emancipation of the slaves.  However, all such hopes are dashed when Kennedy is assassinated.  The threat of ""terrorists"" from Canada and the bleeding of Canadian culture into the fabric of Confederate society forces the Confederate to build a huge concrete wall across the Canadian/C.S.A. border that is nicknamed the Cotton Curtain.There are some that will have a problem with the fake history presented in C.S.A.  For instance, the South didn't seem to have any plans to annex the Northern states.  They just wanted to win the war and be left alone.  Yet, if the Confederacy had won a major battle like Gettysburg and been joined by the British and French their plans could have changed.  The Union would never be okay with the South seceding.  Another war further in the future would probably have been inevitable.The probabilities and what-ifs of history aside, C.S.A. is an ambitious film, and though it suffers from a miniscule budget there are moments when the movie really shines.  For instance, many of the television commercials shown throughout the ""broadcast presentation"" are brilliant in their execution, such as the commercial for a COPS parody called RUNAWAY and an animated commercial featuring the Gold Dust Twins.  Some of these ads remind me of skits from CHAPELLE'S SHOW.  These ads take on more significance when one discovers at the end of the movie that most of them are about products that actual existed or are still in existence.There are also a couple of movie recreations that are done particularly well.  A silent film by D.W. Griffith about the capture of Abraham Lincoln is one example.  This film within a film captures the essence of many silent films of the era, extended gestures, overemphasized facial features, and all.  Another example is the movie I MARRIED AN ABOLITIONIST that captures the feel of 1950s sci-fi movies, such as INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS.  By the same token there are other movie recreations that don't come off so well and look more like a ""movie"" created by a person with their personal video camera.There are a couple of problems I have with the movie.  The first is the historical portrayal of Abraham Lincoln.  A video of Lincoln near the end of his life in 1905 is shown and it has Lincoln saying that his biggest regret is that he never took slavery seriously and that he just used slaves for political purposes.  Lincoln never did do that.  It was a well known fact that Lincoln was an abolitionist.  It was because of his election to the Presidency that the Southern states seceded.  Abolition had been talked of since the signing of the U.S. Constitution and the Southern states knew that with Lincoln as President slavery would soon come to an end.  The remarks the Lincoln of C.S.A. makes are ones completely out of character even for a Lincoln living in a world where the Confederacy won and slavery was still legal.The second issue I had with C.S.A. is the acting, particularly that done by the man portraying John Ambrose Fauntroy V.  I realize that this is a very low budget feature.  I also realize there are times when the acting is supposed to be cheesy.  However, Fauntroy's character is a major player in the movie, but he comes off being as more of a cartoon than a real life politician.C.S.A. is an interesting, entertaining, and satirical film.  The ambition of the project superceded the movie's budget, but that doesn't affect the ideas the film raises.The DVD includes several extras including a commentary with director Kevin Willmott and producer Rick Cowan, another commentary with just Kevin Willmott, some deleted and extended scenes, a short making-of featurette, and a few trailers for other movies.",4,What If the South Never Fell?

997586,A1Y8FBJLVK6LS9,B000FZEU0Q,Wayne A.,"[25, 38]","This movie contains far too many wasted minutes of poor script, bad acting, awkward/weak premise, lost direction and focus, ungainly pace, lamentable costumes and make-up, and insufferably poor parody and satire. Presenting us with a fake BBC-style documentary (oddly, actually it's a very poorly imitated Ken Burns rip) covering the ""history"" of a triumphant Confederate States of America to the present day, the filmmakers show nothing more than a superficial grasp of the subject they fail to satirize, and demonstrate a poor understanding of the forces of history--even as a satirical subject. They bend world history grotesquely out of shape so they can work in disconnected vignettes that I'm sure they thought were cute. The endlessly misfiring effort concludes--in the laboring mightily and producing a mouse fashion--with a postlude revealing the ""truth"" of some of the bits presented, and ending with a pretty silly and anti-climactic condemnation of Uncle Ben and Aunt Jemimah--the twin pillars of racism in America today.I'm not at all critiquing the presumed point of the endeavor, although I was really hard-pressed to find one and what's there does need critiquing, as the film hovers uneasily somewhere in the ""controversy-packed"" (irony here) realm of ""institutional racism is bad"" and ""slavery was bad"" and ""white people are awful especially the darn rednecks""--all cheap shots and dead horses that have been flogged in recent years to the consistency of shredded wheat. As satire--the real issue here, since that's what this film purports to be--it's just plain gawd-awful and the fact that the premise is that the film was a BBC-ish documentary is also mind-bendingly ironic. British TV has produced many of the finest political and social satires going (try ""Whoops, Apocalypse! for starters)and nearly anything from that source puts this astoundingly inept offering to shame. Decent American TV comedy shows, especially those on Comedy Central have covered any bits and pieces of what's offered in this amateurish assembly with greater force and originality. This is the clumsiest and most directionless social/political ""satire"" I've ever seen, bar none.Worse, the ""mockumentary"" is interrupted with badly done fake TV commercials for products that are based on old racist-logo products that once existed. They serve no real satiric purpose--anyone who doesn't know about this sort of marketing in the past, especially if they're hip to racial issues, has been living in a cave, and the relevancy to modern culture, beyond the tiresome Ben/Jemimah dinosaurs is zilch. The filmmakers instead, by wanting to seem clever, threw away an opportunity to focus on other aspects of this alternate C.S.A. history that would have had much greater contemporary relevancy and would have been a heck of a lot funnier. There's a particularly stillborn segment on selling slaves on the Home Shopping Network that showed no mental effort whatsoever (just imagine it, and that's all you get). Anyway, TV commercial parodies gain their force by mixing excellent simulations of the real deal with subversive content--they should look and smell like real TV commercials of today, not like middle-school comedy sketches or commercials of 20 years ago. Paul Verhoeven is the director to study for this, and Saturday Night Live is always great at fake commercials.Overall, this film was largely underdeveloped ""concept"" and poor follow through. For the sake of some tacky jokes--like Lincoln in black-face escaping to Canada--it substitutes historical complexities with just more stereotyping and simple-mindedness, which is a problem a lot of politically driven people have with their so-called ""humor"" these days. The fact that it's been lauded by more than a few--even called ""daring,"" which is utterly absurd since when in the last decades has demonizing the South or people not-of-color been daring?--really worries me, as it indicates a near fatal fall from the heights of, say, Dr. Strangelove or The President's Analyst or Watermelon Man to the lowest art and meanest quality.Good satire should make you chuckle, laugh outright, AND make you think. Great satire should make you feel humble and a little ashamed, as few of us aren't hypocrites or jerks of one sort or another, and it should have the ability to lure in the opposition and make them think a bit too. Otherwise, what's the point? You know, fans of this stuff (and the half-baked efforts of people like Michael Moore, who really needs more criticism from people who agree with his general goals) need to get beyond the point where anything--no matter how poorly rendered--that's against war or racism or sexism or whatnot is just dandy. To be brutally honest, people I know who tolerate and enjoy this sort of incompetent drivel usually never made it beyond a 101 level course in Race in America and tend to feel a little too smug about their predictable set of ""correct"" postures (Bush bad, war bad, racism bad) that are seldom backed with any real thought and are always expressed most eloquently with a bumper sticker. ""Racism bad"" is a fine and noble position to take but if there's no further understanding of the issues involved then the attitude contributes nothing to dealing with very current and very real issues. This movie adds nothing to anyone's understanding of anything about racism, and simply because it took a vaguely ""correct' stance does not exempt it from criticism.The ""Dreadful Truth"" is that Americans who produce and consume this kind of lifestyle ""product""--and don't have any illusions that it's anything but, since, like most Michael Moore product, it's marketed to no one but fellow believers--need to stop reassuring themselves about their ""righteousness,"" and entertaining themselves with smug humor, and instead get down to the hard work of winning over other people... and winning elections. One less sanctimonius documentary on how Bush ""stole"" the 2000 election or how voters are brainless sheep (""stupidist people on Earth"" sez Mr. Moore--and that certainly helped the cause), and one more documentary that maybe sells progressive ideas to average Americans. PLEASE! (The dreadfullest truth is that this film will be nothing more than Friday night stoner party entertainment on left-leaning college campuses across America, and with that comment I've actually helped sales).*Yeah it's low budget and that's no excuse. Sharp filmmakers have done wonders with low budgets and I cite Brownlow's ""It Happened Here"" as the best example of many. The key is you need talent--genius even--and that doesn't show here at all. Advice to Lawrence, Kansas: please don't even attempt things like this if you can't do it very well, and don't see all this ""praise"" as anything but approval of the stupefyingly banal ""correct"" politics of the film. You're amateurish writers, filmmakers, and propagandists and you needed to pay much better attention to the subtle art and structure of the Ken Burns films (and to satire in general) so you can do proper parodies of them. Satire? How about a ""Waiting for Guffman"" style mockumentary about a bunch of untalented and out-of-their-depth middle-class Midwestern white-breads who decide to make a film about, say,  the Holocaust and in the process betray a total ignorance of history, and innocently and unknowingly utilize every awful ethnic stereotype.That's what I'm reminded of here",2,Amateurish and unfocused--was this

997587,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B000FZEU0Q,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[60, 82]","""CSA"" takes the format of the broadcast of a faux British documentary about the history of slavery in the CS after the War of Northern Aggression. It's punctuated with commercials that suggest what life would be like in a society that has thoroughly integrated slavery into its basic structure.Contrary to what some reviewers claim, the documentary is a coherent, well-worked-out speculative history of what might have happened if the South had won. Some of it is based on what the South did, or wanted to do (the invasion and subjugation of South America, for example); most of the rest seems plausible, if only in terms of ""human nature"".Several reviewers correctly pointed out that all the South wanted was the right to continue to spread slavery to states entering the Union, and that it had no /intention/ of conquering the North. This overlooks the fact that the only way it could have had what it wanted was by overthrowing the US government and seizing power. The South /did/ invade the North, and had it seized Washington, it's unlikely it would have simply walked away from the opportunity to take control. Would you?If you're expecting an SNL or MAD TV sketch, you'll be disappointed. Though there are slap-your-knee/laugh-out-loud moments, the subject matter and its basically serious presentation prevent most of it from being amusing.Highly recommended, if you have the stomach for this sort of thing.",5,"a brutal, squirm-inducing satire",1252972800,"09 15, 2009",2009,1415,"['CSA', 'format', 'broadcast', 'faux', 'British', 'documentary', 'history', 'slavery', 'CS', 'War', 'Northern', 'Aggression', 'punctuated', 'commercials', 'suggest', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'society', 'thoroughly', 'integrated', 'slavery', 'basic', 'structure.Contrary', 'what', 'reviewers', 'claim', 'documentary', 'coherent', 'well-worked-out', 'speculative', 'history', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'happened', 'South', 'had', 'won', 'based', 'what', 'South', 'did', 'wanted', 'do', 'invasion', 'subjugation', 'South', 'America', 'example', 'most', 'rest', 'plausible', 'only', 'terms', 'human', 'nature', '.Several', 'reviewers', 'correctly', 'pointed', 'out', 'South', 'wanted', 'was', 'right', 'continue', 'spread', 'slavery', 'states', 'entering', 'Union', 'had', '/intention/', 'conquering', 'North', 'fact', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'what', 'wanted', 'was', 'overthrowing', 'US', 'government', 'seizing', 'power', 'South', '/did/', 'invade', 'North', 'had', 'seized', 'Washington', 'unlikely', 'would', 'have', 'simply', 'walked', 'away', 'opportunity', 'take', 'control', 'Would', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'SNL', 'MAD', 'TV', 'sketch', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'are', 'slap-your-knee/laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'subject', 'matter', 'basically', 'serious', 'presentation', 'prevent', 'most', 'being', 'amusing.Highly', 'recommended', 'have', 'stomach', 'sort', 'thing']",N/A
997588,A38QEATH3NODFM,B000FZEU0Q,Wiseguy 945,"[5, 9]","As I can see from the reveiws before mine, this movie really caused many mixed reactions, which is what it is intended to due, provoke many questions, make people think.  Well, this movie did due that.  I thought it started off promising enough, using the history that is did with the confederates negotiating with europe for support, and the battle of gettysburd changing sides, but it took a turn from their.  The way the The US surrendered so quickly, and then the complete turn over of the country so quickly as well, and no talk of resistance.  I just find it hard to believe that it would have switched so quickly.  The civil war ended essentially for the fact that the North rallied so many troops and resources that they beat the south into submission, they had nothing left to resist with when the war ended.  Even If european powers would have gotten involved, they would have had to help the southern troop more than just one battle, and stay after the battle, because by Gettysburg they were in shambles. Although plans had been to march to D.C. after Gettysburg if won, I think they would have had a larger fight. From there the movie takes a turn for even more radicalism.  Sure, the someone in the southern government had Ideas of ""american dominace of the western hemisphere"" and taking over south america. But come on, do you really think they could have, the resources and time. Yes, it is true the US government had troops stationed on the Tex-mex border when the civil war ended in case we needed to help mexico get the french out, but they did not use them.  I just don't think realistically the european fiends the confederates made would have rolled over and let them take over south america.  Also, Don't forget Africa. they did not explain if the Europeans in africa were happy with the Confederates still continuing the slave trade, again though, Europeans would profit from it.  Also, the progress of the nation after the war to modern day, I just don't think if the course had gone like they say it had that The US would be sitting as a world power, the southern culture was an aggrarian based culture and ways, I just don't, see the defeated northerners buying in Lock, Stock and Barrel into the southern culture, but the movie took that leap.  I just don't know, it all seemed very extreme.  Finally, I don't think the British would have stood by and let the CSA beat on and attack Canada as it did in some of the reports. Canada is still part of the British Commonwealth, and I don't think they would have stood for it. So the US may have had an invasion earlier.  But, It did what it was suppose to, provoke thought and discussion, and I must give Spike lee Kudos for doing that.  I do agree with one reveiwer, this does kind of remind me of someone's senior class project, something I might have discussed in High school. And the senarios are the humor and extremeness I would expect from a high school Sarcastic humor, their was no subtleness about it.
