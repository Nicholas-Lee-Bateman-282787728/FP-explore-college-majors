Nat Serling is sent home from the Persian Gulf with traumas and few prospects after being in a friendly fire incident. He is given what should have been an open-and-shut case: investigate a female chopper pilot for the Medal of Honor. Things become tricky quickly as Serling's support is withdrawn when he discovers discrepancies in the witness' stories and he will have to risk everything to find out the truth about what happened on a dark night in Iraq. Magnetizing throughout, this picture is well-conceived and very compelling, and it has messages about society.

A military woman has always been required to 'prove' herself worthy in her chosen area of profession.  Throughout my career, I noted that it was the administrative field where the majority of women were fortunate enough to receive the promotions and breeze through their time in service without the severity of abuse and warfare from their fellow male comrades.  The actors in this movie portray real life experiences for real veterans.  Meg Ryan is superb as a professional officer who is highly qualified as a leader and helicopter pilot.  Denzel Washington is also superb as a professional officer but did not achieve the ability to be 'sure of himself' until he was chosen to investigate a terrible injustice.

564225,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005221J,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 6]","I know that this isn't the most popular of opinions, but I found this film far too clich&eacute;d and predictable to be anything remotely memorable.  I know I'm coming into this a few years late, but my adoration for Meg Ryan and my sidelined respect for Denzel Washington made my anticipation for this film high.  Sadly, it just didn't really work for me in any way, except for that surprisingly brilliant turn by Matt Damon.  The plot is a little too contrived to be anything memorable.  The idea is nice, but it is poorly realized, with far too many predictable twists that take away from the films apparent poignancy (or need to be so).The film centers on a haunted solider (are there any other kinds?), Serling, who is currently overseeing a Medal of Honor candidate who died in the line of duty.  Battling his own memories of causing the death of a fellow solider and friend, Serling finds some inconsistencies in interviewing those related to the loss of Captain Walden.  When he finds out that Walden was a woman it makes it all the more pertinent to `do this right', a way that Serling can make personal amends for his own errors.But what he finds out is more than he bargained for.Honestly, this film thinks that it is deeper and more shocking than it really is.  You can smell the dishonesty in certain aspects of the plot that foretell events too clearly for the audience, and the ending revelations are just not that impending (unless you count the brilliant facial expression carried by Matt Damon when the revelation is revealed).Outside of Damon though, this film is burdened by unfulfilled performances that take this film down a bad road.  That may be the biggest drawback, because some stellar performances could have elevated the material and sold the film for something more than it was.  Instead, the lack of drive in these performances only highlighted the films `other' flaws.  Much has been said about Meg Ryan's performance in the `praise' category, but I must say that I thought she was nearly awful, and I LOVE her.  She has handled drama before and delivered rather wonderfully (her Oscar snub for `When a Man Loves a Woman' still pisses me off) but this was just a mess.  Her accent was terrible and her character arc was unbelievable.  She tried so hard to play tough and it just didn't work.  Lou Diamond Philips was so stereotypical it was pathetic and Denzel Washington still doesn't really know how to balance out his emotions.  So much is made of him as an actor, but his ability to really nail a performance is sketchy.  Yes, I love him in certain films (Malcolm X, He Got Game) but unless he has a character with some edge or bite he tends to play his characters on the dull side.  He makes Serling a total bore.Maybe that's how I feel about the film as a whole; a total bore.",2,Not that courageous...,1296604800,"02 2, 2011",2011,2814,"['know', ""n't"", 'most', 'popular', 'opinions', 'found', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'predictable', 'be', 'anything', 'remotely', 'memorable', 'know', ""'m"", 'coming', 'few', 'years', 'late', 'adoration', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'sidelined', 'respect', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'made', 'anticipation', 'film', 'high', 'Sadly', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'way', 'surprisingly', 'brilliant', 'turn', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'plot', 'little', 'too', 'contrived', 'be', 'anything', 'memorable', 'idea', 'nice', 'poorly', 'realized', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'predictable', 'twists', 'take', 'away', 'films', 'apparent', 'poignancy', 'need', 'be', 'so', '.The', 'film', 'centers', 'haunted', 'solider', 'are', 'there', 'other', 'kinds', 'Serling', 'who', 'currently', 'overseeing', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'candidate', 'who', 'died', 'line', 'duty', 'Battling', 'own', 'memories', 'causing', 'death', 'fellow', 'solider', 'friend', 'Serling', 'inconsistencies', 'interviewing', 'related', 'loss', 'Captain', 'Walden', 'When', 'out', 'Walden', 'was', 'woman', 'more', 'pertinent', 'do', 'right', 'way', 'Serling', 'can', 'make', 'personal', 'amends', 'own', 'errors.But', 'what', 'out', 'more', 'bargained', 'for.Honestly', 'film', 'deeper', 'more', 'shocking', 'really', 'can', 'smell', 'dishonesty', 'certain', 'aspects', 'plot', 'foretell', 'events', 'too', 'clearly', 'audience', 'ending', 'revelations', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'impending', 'count', 'brilliant', 'facial', 'expression', 'carried', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'when', 'revelation', 'revealed', '.Outside', 'Damon', 'film', 'burdened', 'unfulfilled', 'performances', 'take', 'film', 'down', 'bad', 'road', 'may', 'be', 'biggest', 'drawback', 'stellar', 'performances', 'could', 'have', 'elevated', 'material', 'sold', 'film', 'something', 'more', 'was', 'Instead', 'lack', 'drive', 'performances', 'only', 'highlighted', 'films', 'other', 'flaws', 'Much', 'been', 'said', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'performance', 'praise', 'category', 'must', 'say', 'thought', 'was', 'nearly', 'awful', 'LOVE', 'handled', 'drama', 'delivered', 'rather', 'wonderfully', 'Oscar', 'snub', 'When', 'Man', 'Woman', 'still', 'off', 'was', 'just', 'mess', 'accent', 'was', 'terrible', 'character', 'arc', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'play', 'tough', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Philips', 'was', 'so', 'stereotypical', 'was', 'pathetic', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'still', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'how', 'balance', 'out', 'emotions', 'So', 'much', 'made', 'actor', 'ability', 'really', 'nail', 'performance', 'sketchy', 'Yes', 'love', 'certain', 'films', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'Got', 'Game', 'character', 'edge', 'bite', 'play', 'characters', 'dull', 'side', 'Serling', 'total', 'bore.Maybe', 'how', 'feel', 'film', 'whole', 'total', 'bore']",N/A

564227,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00005221J,Austin Somlo,"[2, 2]","Viewed: 7/08Rate: 77/08: Edward Zwick reteams with Denzel Washington for another military picture after Glory in 1989. Once again, they make the best out of Courage Under Fire. Although I do think that Denzel Washington did a nice job in this movie, I would say his role had helped him a lot before taking on Antwone Fisher. In addition, Matt Damon (who clearly lost a good deal of weight which is noticeable by the thinness of his face) and Lou Diamond Phillips (what happened to him for a long time? He has always been a good actor) turned in pretty good supporting performances. I question the casting of Meg Ryan; there is a lack of credibility whenever I see her sporting a military uniform. And I've always hated her for a long time. What I liked about Courage Under Fire is its gripping effect due to the story. That alone is the sole reason for my high rating, and then adding in the performances, I was satisfied that I saw a respectable picture. The editing work, for three-quarters of the action scenes in Iraq, are done very well, but as the story got extended more as I am to learn about the facts/fictions of what happened in Al Bathra, it gets a bit boring. But it wasn't nonsensical like it did in Basic (jeez, what a ridiculous movie) because there wasn't a ""black person"" twist thrown in. Rather, there is a surprising twist that comes at near the end of the movie that starts to make more sense. However, I feel a little bit lost when one character commits suicide; that's where I felt a small hole that wasn't sealed shut. Then again, the story is still good. I liked the inclusion of Scott Glenn in this movie, but I don't like how he had to be set up with the dialogues. It makes him look bit of a vulture; I rather see a more sympathetic side out of him through his dialogues. I have to say again, Matt Damon was pretty good for his character, and I was impressed. Denzel Washington goes further than his usual but not as far enough as he did in Glory or Antwone Fisher. Still, it's a nice change from his usual Denzel method. Lou Diamond Phillips just needs to do more films; he is too good of an actor to not to get major roles. All in all, Courage Under Fire is an enjoyable fare that won't disappoint, but it's not that outstanding; just a decent watch.",4,Surprisingly Good.,1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,2280,"['Viewed', '7/08Rate', '77/08', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'reteams', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'military', 'picture', 'Glory', '1989', 'Once', 'again', 'make', 'best', 'Courage', 'Fire', 'do', 'think', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'role', 'had', 'helped', 'lot', 'taking', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'addition', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'who', 'clearly', 'lost', 'good', 'deal', 'weight', 'noticeable', 'thinness', 'face', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'what', 'happened', 'long', 'time', 'always', 'been', 'good', 'actor', 'turned', 'pretty', 'good', 'supporting', 'performances', 'question', 'casting', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'lack', 'credibility', 'whenever', 'see', 'sporting', 'military', 'uniform', ""'ve"", 'always', 'hated', 'long', 'time', 'What', 'liked', 'Courage', 'Fire', 'gripping', 'effect', 'due', 'story', 'alone', 'sole', 'reason', 'high', 'rating', 'then', 'adding', 'performances', 'was', 'satisfied', 'saw', 'respectable', 'picture', 'editing', 'work', 'three-quarters', 'action', 'scenes', 'Iraq', 'are', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'story', 'got', 'extended', 'more', 'am', 'learn', 'facts/fictions', 'what', 'happened', 'Al', 'Bathra', 'bit', 'boring', 'was', ""n't"", 'nonsensical', 'did', 'Basic', 'jeez', 'what', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'black', 'person', 'twist', 'thrown', 'Rather', 'surprising', 'twist', 'end', 'movie', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'However', 'feel', 'little', 'bit', 'lost', 'when', 'one', 'character', 'commits', 'suicide', 'where', 'felt', 'small', 'hole', 'was', ""n't"", 'sealed', 'shut', 'Then', 'again', 'story', 'still', 'good', 'liked', 'inclusion', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'had', 'be', 'set', 'up', 'dialogues', 'look', 'bit', 'vulture', 'rather', 'see', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'side', 'dialogues', 'have', 'say', 'again', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'character', 'was', 'impressed', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'further', 'usual', 'not', 'far', 'enough', 'did', 'Glory', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'Still', 'nice', 'change', 'usual', 'Denzel', 'method', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'just', 'do', 'more', 'films', 'too', 'good', 'actor', 'not', 'get', 'major', 'roles', 'Courage', 'Fire', 'enjoyable', 'fare', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'not', 'outstanding', 'just', 'decent', 'watch']",N/A

564229,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B00005221J,Bobby Underwood,"[1, 1]","Courage Under Fire is a riveting look at the aftermath of combat on a group of soldiers with a dark secret. Much more than simply a military drama, it becomes a more personal tale as more light is shed on what really happened. Director Edward Zwick made something special here, as what could easily have been a routine story, takes on depth and a sense of honor and history as the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the first female officer killed in combat turns into a marshy quicksand of lies and deception regarding the events leading to her death.Lieutenant Colonel Nathaniel Serling (Denzel Washington) is assigned the task of signing off on the details so Captain Karen Walden (Meg Ryan) can be given the Medal of Honor for her sacrifice. But as Serling begins to talk to the crew of soldiers who went down with Walden in the Medivac helicopter over Kuwait, he becomes unsure whether or not she deserves it. It is not any kind of preconceptions about women in combat that prompts Serling's misgivings, but his seasoned senses as a soldier which tell him he is not being told the truth.Michael Moriarty gives a fine performance as Serling's superior and old friend, Brigadier General Hershberg. The President very much wants to give Walden her medal posthumously and pressure is exerted on Serling to speed up his investigation. Ilario (Matt Damon) was the closest to Walden and appears frightened of Serling's probing. Lou Diamond Phillips gives perhaps his best performance as the tough Sgt. Monfriez, a military lifer with a huge chip on his shoulder. He believes Serling is there to whitewash what happened, so refuses to tell him anything.Denzel Washington gives another great performance as the flawed Lieutenant Colonel Serling, whose attempt to get at the truth may cost him what is left of his tarnished career. Scott Glenn has a nice turn in support as a reporter who can smell a big story in this quietly powerful drama. This film is about honor and integrity, and human weakness. The flashback scenes are riveting as each soldier tells his version of events. When Serling finally uncovers a truth quite different from the offical version, it still remains a story of courage under fire.Though Denzel gets most of the screen time, Meg Ryan not only holds her own but equals him. Her moments onscreen paint a portrait of a very real person who served her country bravely and with honor. This film slowly draws you in until you are glued to the screen, waiting for the truth to come out. It is a testament to honor and sacrifice by soldiers serving their country bravely under difficult circumstances. This is a region two UK version.

Those who describe this as &#34;action packed&#34; are sorely mistaken. This is an intense, well-scripted drama, that sees Denzel in his prime, and Meg Ryan offer the best performance of her career. It is a tribute to the silent fallen, that is as relevant today as it was in 1995.",5,A painfully beautiful inquiry into the truths of warfare...,1373932800,"07 16, 2013",2013,760,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'age', '16', 'thought', 'was', '34', 'cool', '34', 'was', 'unable', 'articulate', 'emotion', 'felt', 'time', 'first', 'viewing', 'then', 'have', 'held', 'movie', 'high-esteem', 'Now', 'age-33', 'intimate', 'knowledge', 'struggles', 'faced', 'hurl', 'battle-fields', 'can', 'only', 'describe', 'movie', 'painfully', 'beautiful', 'inquiry', 'truths', 'warfare', 'are', 'so', 'often', 'buried', 'chasm', 'military', 'public', 'presentation', 'who', 'describe', '34', 'action', 'packed', '34', 'are', 'sorely', 'mistaken', 'intense', 'well-scripted', 'drama', 'Denzel', 'prime', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'offer', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'tribute', 'silent', 'fallen', 'relevant', 'today', 'was', '1995']",N/A
564235,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,B00005221J,DarthRad,"[4, 5]","This was one of my favorite movies from the 1990's.A great many things have happened since then to make anyone want to forget this movie, but one day I saw the DVD on Amazon listed for this ridiculously low price, so I got it.Ah, how things have changed! In 1996 when this movie was made, Meg Ryan was at the peak of her career - she'd been named Woman of the Year by the Harvard Hasty Pudding Society in 1994, and could have just as well been named ""America's Sweetheart"".  She had built up such a reservoir of goodwill for the sweet and lovable characters that she played. Then, in 2001, she turned 40, and had an affair with Russell Crowe while making ""Proof of Life"" (another movie that I loved at the time, but have since forgotten).  She then fell into a full-blown mid-life crisis and basically went nuts, wrecking her face, her public image, and her career. At age 45, she's too old now for the innocent sweetheart roles that made her career, and she hasn't been able to move on to the few wife/mother/divorcee/career woman roles that Hollywood offers to middle-aged actresses. And so she has almost disappeared from the big screen.At the time, playing the hard-nosed Captain Emma Walden in this movie, Meg Ryan was making a major departure from her usual roles, which only made the story of her character even more poignant.  Yes, Captain Walden screamed and cussed at her men and behaved like a ""dyke"" (that's a quote from a character in the movie, not my opinion, by the way), but we, the moviegoers, all knew that was still good old sweet Meg Ryan underneath that crusty exterior.Denzel Washington played the deeply conflicted Col. Serling, and this movie would be one of several in the 1990's that would establish him as an A-list superstar.Lou Diamond Phillips played the angry, callous, and tortured Sgt. Monfriez.  Wow! Was it in 1987 that he made ""La Bamba""? He was great in that movie and in this movie!  And unfortunately those are the only two movies that he's made that I even recognize, as his career fell off into mostly B-movies and TV guest roles.Matt Damion!  I didn't even recognize him in this movie, playing the medic Ilario - he was so young and thin back then.  This was one of his first big roles, before he became a star with ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"".Ah, and of course, there was the background setting of what was known at the time as the Persian Gulf War, but now is usually referred to as the First Iraq War or Iraq War I, to distinguish it from the current quagmire, Iraq War Part Deux.So no wonder the price of this DVD has dropped like a rock!  Subject matter - Iraq War I - who wants to remember that one anymore?  Key star of the movie - Meg Ryan - wrecked her image and alienated her fanbase.  Time for a clearance sale!But, this is still a great movie, and it will bring a tear to your eyes.The story of ""Courage Under Fire"" is a fiction, but many elements came straight out of the news stories at the time about the real Iraq War I.I have always thought, for instance, that the idea for the character of Captain Emma Walden was based on the real-life Major Marie Rossi, a Chinook helicopter pilot who was killed in the war.  Right before the invasion began, the extremely photogenic Rossi had appeared on national TV in an interview with CNN, talking about flying into combat and facing the possibility of dying in the war. A few days after the interview was broadcast, she and her crew were killed when her helicopter hit the support wires of an unlit microwave tower and crashed.  I remember seeing her in the interview and then hearing of her death, and it was quite sad.Friendly fire was a major element of the news stories from Iraq War I, with the photos of  grieving soldiers who had discovered that their friends had died from friendly fire.""Courage Under Fire"" unfolds its tangled storyline in classic ""Rashomon"" fashion.  An ex-tank commander, anguished by his role in an episode of friendly fire that is being covered up by the Army brass, is re-assigned to a desk job to investigate pending medals, one of them being a Medal of Honor to be awarded to the first female soldier to be given such a medal for heroism in combat. His investigation turns up several versions of what happened before he discovers the truth, which turns out to be yet another variety of ""friendly fire"". And thus fortified, he is also able to address the truth of his own involvement in the friendly fire incident as well.The final scene of the movie is poignant, mysterious, and lingers in the mind. I still think about it today.  It is a replay of an earlier scene in the movie, with one new bit of detail.It is the morning after the tank battle, and Col. Serling is standing next to the burnt-out tank of his friend, who lies dead on top of the turret.  An Army Medevac helicopter that had landed to pick up the wounded takes off in front of him, and Col. Serling looks up, and we see, for the first time, that the pilot of this helicopter is none other than Capt. Walden. She seems to be smiling at him. Is this really how that moment in time transpired?  Was she on her way to the battle that would play out in the rest of this movie and go on to earn her the Medal of Honor? Or is this just a trick of Col. Serling's memory, and he is seeing Capt. Walden in his dreams, placing her at this awful moment in time, and she is smiling at him in approval because he has finally gained absolution for both of them by uncovering the truth?",5,Still a

This is a worthy follow-up and it was almost largely ignored since it was the year of Titantic & LA Confidential and ""Courage"" was lost in the shuffle.  Nevertheless this is a thought provoking meditative film about courage & cowardice under fire. Washington in a very difficult (he should have been nominated at least!!) is outstanding as a stoic officer who makes a bitter mistake under fire and accidentally kills one of his men.  Ryan is just as fine as the late officer who is under investigation for her part in a fire fight with the enemy.  I disagree with a lot of the reviewers who felt she was miscast since before this film she did a number of comedies and was severely type cast.  The acting is solid thoroughout with Lou Diamond Phillips & an emaciated Matt Damon being the standouts. Also Michael Moriarty is fine as Washington's superior.

Let me hasten to add, I enjoyed Courage Under Fire, but I had two gripes:(1) In the scene where the Meg Ryan character dies while charging the Iraquis and firing an M16, we can see down the muzzle of the rifle, and the ""muzzle"" is a mere pinprick. Obviously, this is a blank gun. A small thing, but jarring to those who know guns, at a key moment in the film.(2) The entire premise of the movie is bogus. An Army helicopter pilot played by Meg Ryan has been killed in combat, and has been nominated for a posthumous Medal of Honor. Denzel Washington's character is tapped to investigate the circumstances surrounding her death. This is a political hot potato because, if he recommends her award, she will become (drum roll) THE FIRST WOMAN EVER AWARDED THE MEDAL OF HONOR.False. Historically, factually false. Dr. Mary Edwards Walker of the Civil War Union Army was awarded the Medal of Honor on November 11, 1865. This is, um, kind of an important point.

Ed Zwick manages to do just that in this outstanding film.

Col Nathaniel Serling (Denzel Washington) is investigating an incident during the Gulf War to determine whether or not the Medal of Honor should be awarded posthumously to Captain Karen Walden (Meg Ryan). It does not take us long to find out that the title of this film refers to both Serling and Walden. The initial story on Walden, the pilot of a rescue helicopter, is that she made a spectacular rescue of a downed helicopter crew, then fought off attacking Iraquis after her own copter crashed, dying right before the besieged group was rescued. But as Serling questions the surviving members of Walden's crew, he discovers their various versions do not jive, and he begins to question what is the truth of what really happened. Moreover, Serling is haunted by his own actions during the Gulf War, where he was responsible for a ""friendly fire"" incident that resulted in the death of American soldiers. To complicate matters even more, Serling is drinking way too much, has grown distant from his family, and is being hounded by both a commanding officer (Michael Moriarity) who wants the P.R. value of Walden being the first woman to receive the Medal of Honor and a reporter (Scott Glenn) who knows something of what happened to the Colonel in Iraq and wants to know the rest.""Courage Under Fire"" makes excellent use of the ""Rashomon"" technique, wherein we get to see each person's version of what really happened in Iraq. Serling's own feelings of guilt and responsibility for what happened in Iraq provide an additional level of depth to the narrative (more so than in Kurosawa's original classic film in fact). Some may find the parallel attempts to find redemption to be somewhat heavy handed, but ultimately the film succeeds because of the solid acting performances. In addition to Washington and Ryan, who never have a scene together, there are solid performances from Lou Diamond Phillips and a very underweight Matt Damon as surviving members of Walden's crew, Michael Moriarity as the General, Scott Glenn as the reporter, and Regina Taylor as Serling's wife. Certainly this film is closer to the reality of Desert Storm than ""Three Kings,"" but the main enjoyment here is watching Ryan and her crew do the same lines with totally different meanings because of radical changes in context while Washington tries to find meaning in his own life.",4,A Gulf War Rashomon with Washington and Ryan,1012348800,"01 30, 2002",2002,2414,"['basic', 'plot', 'line', 'Courage', 'Fire', 'Lt.', 'Col', 'Nathaniel', 'Serling', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'investigating', 'incident', 'Gulf', 'War', 'determine', 'not', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'should', 'be', 'awarded', 'posthumously', 'Captain', 'Karen', 'Walden', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'find', 'out', 'title', 'film', 'refers', 'Serling', 'Walden', 'initial', 'story', 'Walden', 'pilot', 'rescue', 'helicopter', 'made', 'spectacular', 'rescue', 'downed', 'helicopter', 'crew', 'then', 'fought', 'off', 'attacking', 'Iraquis', 'own', 'copter', 'crashed', 'dying', 'right', 'besieged', 'group', 'was', 'rescued', 'Serling', 'questions', 'surviving', 'members', 'Walden', 'crew', 'various', 'versions', 'do', 'not', 'jive', 'question', 'what', 'truth', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Moreover', 'Serling', 'haunted', 'own', 'actions', 'Gulf', 'War', 'where', 'was', 'responsible', 'friendly', 'fire', 'incident', 'resulted', 'death', 'American', 'soldiers', 'complicate', 'matters', 'even', 'more', 'Serling', 'drinking', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'grown', 'distant', 'family', 'being', 'hounded', 'commanding', 'officer', 'Michael', 'Moriarity', 'who', 'P.R', 'value', 'Walden', 'being', 'first', 'woman', 'receive', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'reporter', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'who', 'something', 'what', 'happened', 'Colonel', 'Iraq', 'know', 'rest', 'Courage', 'Fire', 'excellent', 'use', 'Rashomon', 'technique', 'wherein', 'get', 'see', 'person', 'version', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Iraq', 'Serling', 'own', 'feelings', 'guilt', 'responsibility', 'what', 'happened', 'Iraq', 'provide', 'additional', 'level', 'depth', 'narrative', 'more', 'so', 'Kurosawa', 'original', 'classic', 'film', 'fact', 'may', 'find', 'parallel', 'attempts', 'find', 'redemption', 'be', 'somewhat', 'heavy', 'handed', 'ultimately', 'film', 'solid', 'acting', 'performances', 'addition', 'Washington', 'Ryan', 'who', 'never', 'have', 'scene', 'together', 'are', 'solid', 'performances', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'very', 'underweight', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'surviving', 'members', 'Walden', 'crew', 'Michael', 'Moriarity', 'General', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'reporter', 'Regina', 'Taylor', 'Serling', 'wife', 'Certainly', 'film', 'closer', 'reality', 'Desert', 'Storm', 'Three', 'Kings', 'main', 'enjoyment', 'here', 'watching', 'Ryan', 'crew', 'do', 'same', 'lines', 'totally', 'different', 'meanings', 'radical', 'changes', 'context', 'Washington', 'find', 'meaning', 'own', 'life']",N/A

We find Denzel's character, Lt Col Serling, as a tank officer in a desk job after the war, having been deeply affected by a friendly fire incident that occurred on his watch. As a favor to keep this good soldier who's since become a sot, his commander assigns him the task of investigating whether a KIA deserves a post-humous Medal of Honor. LTC Serling is rather stunned to open the file and see it is a female helicopter pilot, Meg Ryan's character: Captain Walden. As Serling goes about interviewing witnesses, he discovers that the pieces of their stories conflict. The manner in which the stories conflict is played out in a series of flashbacks with varied interpretations. Serling becomes determined to find the truth and through finding the truth, being somehow able to atone for his own mistakes. The truth surrounding CPT Walden's fate becomes imperative to Serling's own fate and in dealing with his past demons. This is a well-acted movie, and you will want to know the truth too as the plot builds and the flashbacks show each conflicting version of an unfortunate, complicated situation.Meg Ryan is miscast despite the film's efforts to change her appearance by dying and cutting her hair to have her appear as more of a ""toughie"" than a ""cutie"". She also speaks with a Southern accent which she can't get quite gritty enough with such a naturally high, sweet voice. And it's hard to get around those big, light blue, sensitive eyes of hers. There are several military-incorrect instances -- those of you are are also one of ""them"" with prior service know what I'm talking about. Most glaring is that while CPT Walden IS post-humously deserving of a medal, it is a stretch that it should be the Medal of Honor -- I won't go further into this here because the movie's is a good one and worth seeing for other reasons.Scott Glen, Lou Diamond Philips, and a then unknown Matt Damon are part of the supporting cast.

564264,A1K4VAYQQLNFVS,B00005221J,"""peterdao""","[1, 3]","Apart from the credits going to director Ed Zwick and to screenplay writer Patrick Duncan who successfully managed to apply the &quot;Rashomon&quot; technique into a dramatic (and controversial) depiction of war, the fine performance of a strong cast really added up to make &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot; a worthwhile place in every movie buff's library. Many reviewers have recognized Denzel Washington's great job as a tortured soldier struggling to find the truth that might help him put down an unbearable burden, but it was Meg Ryan who actually amazed me. After watching this movie for the fourth time or so I finally figured out why I adored her so much in a role that she didn't originally seem to show her best at. Putting aside her culminating, undeniable success in a streak of romantic comedies, I remember having seen her in just a few dramas like &quot;Top Gun&quot;, &quot;The Presidio&quot;, &quot;The Doors&quot;, &quot;When a man loves a woman&quot;, &quot;Proof of life&quot;..., and (no offense to Ryan fans) she never gave a creditable performance in any of them. But somehow, she truly shone in this unexpected role of a female commanding officer under fire. I've been wondering... what if the role were given to Sigourney Weaver... or to Linda Hamilton...? Well, the portrayal might have been &quot;tougher&quot; and the war scenes much more exciting, but I'm sure the movie wouldn't have given me this strange kind of emotion... Then I realized something. Meg Ryan looked so fragile, so vulnerable as Captain Karen Walden when she faced a critical situation that required all deadliest decisions in a matter of seconds. And as fragile as she looked, she ended up handling it in the most valorous way a person could do. Only Ryan's natural &quot;cuteness&quot; and vulnerability could render the image of Karen Walden such candor, credibility and merit. That image has impressed me quite a lot and strengthened my admiration towards all servicewomen who go out there serving the country, women who are ready to sacrifice their lives, not for a Medal of Honor or anything, but for a good cause they chose. Remember how Denzel Washington as Lt. Col. Serling corrected a White House P.R. agent when that guy mentioned the Medal of Honor?. &quot;They don't WIN it. They receive it. It's not a contest&quot;.

He is given the particularly controversial assignment of recommmending or not recommending a female officer killed in action for the Medal of Honor. As she would be the first woman to receive this honor, Washington's every move is scrutinized, and his investigation provides a lack of easy answers or direction.Washington's Lt.

Denzel Washington must investigate the situation surrounding a medical chopper being shot down and if the commanding office of that chopper, Meg Ryan, should receive the medal of honor.  She would be the first woman ever to receive this decoration, and it would be posthumously.  Denzel's character receives conflicting information and is determined to get to the bottom of what is going on.  The cast is rounded out by Lou Diamond Phillips, Matt Damon and a few other familier faces.Under the surface this becomes a better movie.  Denzel's character is struggling with a friendly fire incident he was just involved in and is willing to take responsibility that the Pentagon will not allow him.  His inner struggle is a fine secondary story line and as any good soldier would do he is doing without the help of his family (his wife is trying to help) or his friend and commanding officer (whom he will not turn to).An excellent insight into human emotion, the conflict of war, the battle of the sexes and one man's struggle to do what is right.

564278,AP3B615GM191G,B00005221J,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 4]","There are two primary reasons why I chose to recently watch this film: First, the fact that Denzel Washington is such an incredible, impassionate actor.  Second, that Washington's movies often serve as vehicles to stoke his creative talents.  He feeds the script with his passion, and his passion can take a decent story and turn it into an emotional one.  However, ""Courage Under Fire"" failed to hook me in on both of those counts.Let's begin with the plot: Basically, Denzel plays a former military commander from Desert Storm (with a pretty big skeleton in his closet) who is now in charge of investigating the applicants for the prestigious ""Medal of Honor"" military award.  While researching this particular case, however, ""Denzel"" stumbles upon a few little inconsistencies that, once they begin to add up, point to a larger cover-up at work.  The story is told through the flash-backs of all the people that ""Denzel"" speaks with while doing his detective work, so to speak.  Of course, as is human recollection, each person has a bit of a different ""take"" on the subject...but is it really just bad memories or something more sinister?Though that may sound like a very interesting plot, to me it fell flat because it tried to do too many things at one time when it could have just focused on one it two.  It tries to be an action picture, but there aren't enough war scenes to justify that characterization.  It tries to be a mystery, but that doesn't really work because the viewer never really (at least I didn't) figures out exactly what went on in the central point of conflict.  Finally, the film also tries to be a morality play, yet not even that tugs at the heartstrings (not the dramatic ones, at least) since it is so stoic and military-esque in its approach.Perhaps the biggest failure in this film, though, was the missed opportunities (or maybe it was just bad casting) for Denzel Washington.  As a performer, he is at his peak when he is given the opportunity to emote wildly and passionately for a cause he strongly believes in.  However, this film takes on such a rigid, non-dramatic tone that Denzel never gets to show that incredible acting style.  One only one occasion does he start to get heated, but that approach is quickly squashed and the procedural stuff rolls on.Thus, I really can't recommend this film to fans of Washington's work, or to fans of military mystery/thrillers.  It is just too procedural and droll to really hook you into the whole experience.  A 2.5 star rating would have been my optimal choice, but there is just enough solid acting and some compelling material to give it a boost up rather than down.  I much more highly recommend the film ""High Crimes"", as it covers some of the same basic dramatic material but does so in a much more high-energy, dramatic fashion.",3,Decent Film But Never Really Sucked Me In,1246838400,"07 6, 2009",2009,2819,"['are', 'two', 'primary', 'reasons', 'why', 'chose', 'recently', 'watch', 'film', 'First', 'fact', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'such', 'incredible', 'impassionate', 'actor', 'Second', 'Washington', 'movies', 'often', 'serve', 'vehicles', 'stoke', 'creative', 'talents', 'script', 'passion', 'passion', 'can', 'take', 'decent', 'story', 'turn', 'emotional', 'one', 'However', 'Courage', 'Fire', 'failed', 'hook', 'counts.Let', 'begin', 'plot', 'Basically', 'Denzel', 'former', 'military', 'commander', 'Desert', 'Storm', 'pretty', 'big', 'skeleton', 'closet', 'who', 'now', 'charge', 'investigating', 'applicants', 'prestigious', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'military', 'award', 'researching', 'particular', 'case', 'however', 'Denzel', 'few', 'little', 'inconsistencies', 'once', 'begin', 'add', 'up', 'point', 'larger', 'cover-up', 'work', 'story', 'told', 'flash-backs', 'people', 'Denzel', 'doing', 'detective', 'work', 'so', 'speak', 'course', 'human', 'recollection', 'person', 'bit', 'different', 'take', 'subject', 'really', 'just', 'bad', 'memories', 'something', 'more', 'sinister', 'may', 'sound', 'very', 'interesting', 'plot', 'fell', 'flat', 'tried', 'do', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'one', 'time', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'focused', 'one', 'two', 'be', 'action', 'picture', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'war', 'scenes', 'justify', 'characterization', 'be', 'mystery', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'viewer', 'never', 'really', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'went', 'central', 'point', 'conflict', 'Finally', 'film', 'also', 'be', 'morality', 'play', 'yet', 'not', 'even', 'tugs', 'heartstrings', 'not', 'dramatic', 'ones', 'least', 'so', 'stoic', 'military-esque', 'approach.Perhaps', 'biggest', 'failure', 'film', 'was', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'bad', 'casting', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'performer', 'peak', 'when', 'given', 'opportunity', 'emote', 'wildly', 'passionately', 'cause', 'strongly', 'However', 'film', 'rigid', 'non-dramatic', 'tone', 'Denzel', 'never', 'show', 'incredible', 'acting', 'style', 'One', 'only', 'one', 'occasion', 'start', 'get', 'heated', 'approach', 'quickly', 'squashed', 'procedural', 'stuff', 'rolls', 'on.Thus', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'Washington', 'work', 'fans', 'military', 'mystery/thrillers', 'just', 'too', 'procedural', 'droll', 'really', 'hook', 'whole', 'experience', '2.5', 'star', 'rating', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'optimal', 'choice', 'just', 'enough', 'solid', 'acting', 'compelling', 'material', 'give', 'boost', 'up', 'rather', 'down', 'much', 'more', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'High', 'Crimes', 'same', 'basic', 'dramatic', 'material', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'high-energy', 'dramatic', 'fashion']",N/A
