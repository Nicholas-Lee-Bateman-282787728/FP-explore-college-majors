1167499,A16BGWIVKNVI6L,B001AQT10I,John T. McLeaish,"[44, 52]","Seaquest 2032 - ""Season 3"" - Does have Sea Life, Scientific Research, and the Preservation of the Seas & Oceans in it.  Though not to the great extent that the first 2 Seasons of SeaQuest DSV had.  And to the development of the characters goes, I would suggest that Reviewer 232629 look back at the connection between Bridger/Westphalen & Krieg/Hitchcock in Season One and O'Neill/Henderson & Bridger/Dr. Smith in Season 2.  I don't think that the connection between Commander Ford and Helmswoman/Ensign or other Officer Rank Henderson should be BOOed because of the previous examples.As for Lucas' development I beleive that it was okay because it shows that Lucas can't stay a kid forever and gives him more depth in that people have to change/evolve as needed to their situation.  The same for Dagwood and Tony Piccolo who both grow as characters.  Piccolo goes from being a misfit to ""An Officer and A Gentlemen.""  Dagwood has gone from cleaning SeaQuest/Childlike attitude in Season 2 to actually having a Grown-Up attitude in Season 3.For Captain Nathan Hale Bridger (played by Roy Scheider) to leave SeaQuest was heart breaking but he did return in at least 2 other Episodes after the Season 3 Premiere.  As some would say, ""When you feel that it is time to leave, then it is time to leave.""  The same can be said for Lt. James Brody (played by Edward Kerr).Though some changes to the show were not well recieved, that I'll grant, the changes to some the characters were well done in my opinion.",3,"In Regards to Reviewer 232629's ""Season 3 is Trash, December 9, 2008""",1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,1502,"['Seaquest', '2032', 'Season', '3', 'Does', 'have', 'Sea', 'Life', 'Scientific', 'Research', 'Preservation', 'Seas', 'Oceans', 'not', 'great', 'extent', 'first', '2', 'Seasons', 'SeaQuest', 'DSV', 'had', 'development', 'characters', 'would', 'suggest', 'Reviewer', '232629', 'look', 'back', 'connection', 'Bridger/Westphalen', 'Krieg/Hitchcock', 'Season', 'One', ""O'Neill/Henderson"", 'Bridger/Dr', 'Smith', 'Season', '2', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'connection', 'Commander', 'Ford', 'Helmswoman/Ensign', 'other', 'Officer', 'Rank', 'Henderson', 'should', 'be', 'BOOed', 'previous', 'examples.As', 'Lucas', 'development', 'beleive', 'was', 'okay', 'Lucas', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stay', 'kid', 'forever', 'more', 'depth', 'people', 'have', 'change/evolve', 'as', 'needed', 'situation', 'same', 'Dagwood', 'Tony', 'Piccolo', 'who', 'grow', 'characters', 'Piccolo', 'being', 'misfit', 'Officer', 'A', 'Gentlemen', 'Dagwood', 'gone', 'cleaning', 'SeaQuest/Childlike', 'attitude', 'Season', '2', 'actually', 'having', 'Grown-Up', 'attitude', 'Season', '3.For', 'Captain', 'Nathan', 'Hale', 'Bridger', 'played', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'leave', 'SeaQuest', 'was', 'heart', 'breaking', 'did', 'return', 'least', '2', 'other', 'Episodes', 'Season', '3', 'Premiere', 'would', 'say', 'When', 'feel', 'time', 'leave', 'then', 'time', 'leave', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Lt.', 'James', 'Brody', 'played', 'Edward', 'Kerr', 'changes', 'show', 'were', 'not', 'well', 'recieved', ""'ll"", 'grant', 'changes', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'opinion']",Seaquest - Season 3

1167501,A3KHBA1XUN2YKE,B001AQT10I,molepoblano,"[1, 1]","Lots of people talk badly about this season of Seaquest.  It was different from the other two seasons.  Season 1 did have the best crew and premise, but really, even then some of the stories were real stinkers.  It had promise and a lot of good moments, but it was still rough around the edges.  Season 2 had even less good moments, but still some, but was so very, very painful.  The stories were TERRIBLE.  But I remember reading an article in the summer of 95 about how, after watching Crimson Rage (submarine movie), the producers saw the error in their ways and decided to keep Seaquest in the water (as opposed to flying to other planets).  So I thought season 3 was like season 3 of Star Trek TNG.  There was finally some depth to the characters.  The stories were a bit more real (for science fiction). And season 2 had been so awful that almost anything would have been an improvement.  I think Michael Ironside was a great captain and he brought a nice new feeling to the show.  Watching the &#34;lost&#34; unaired episodes on Netflix, though, I was disappointed with the fate of Fredericks in the last episode.  She was an interesting character who could have been developed more.  And Lucas, of course, could have been developed less.  But all in all, it was a good season, and it should be released on DVD.

1167503,A3MQ15651KGVLJ,B001AQT10I,Rick L. Parrish,"[11, 12]",I ordered this from JB Hi-Fi Online(google it) in Australia (kind of a national Best Buy there) and paid (current exchange rate then .97 American to 1 Aussie dollar) just under $40.00 (24.95 + 12.80 shipping before currency conversion via paypal...came out to 39 something - don't have it right in front of me) but it was worth it.  The set is NTSC and is region free. It is an official Universal Studios release of the season for those of you who are picky...it is not bootleg...it is released through ViaVision their official distributor in Australia.  It was supposed to take a month and I did have to wait a week while they got new stock from their supplier (and customer service is great!) but once it was shipped I had it in just over a week.  The set was in good condition and I was overjoyed when I found it would play in my USA DVD player!  So if you're willing to pay forty dollars and wait a bit to get it you can stop waiting on Universal to get off their collective behind and order this one (I didn't see any added bonus content noted on the box but I'll settle for the final 13 episodes and maybe add a US release later...and that's a BIG maybe).  I checked other outlets in Australia before settling on JB Hi-Fi because of their size and reputation down under and because the prices I saw elsewhere were way higher for the same thing and since I knew there would be a sizeable shipping charge I went with these guys and I don't regret it for a second. I've watched ten minutes of the first episode to make sure it's playable and excellent picture and sound quality (it is) and if there are any problems I'll come back and tell you.,5,Available in Australia!!!!!
