1042958,A3PZR5NI1EGMP1,B000M341SC,"A. Cooper ""possum""","[8, 25]","I had seen the incredible Capote, and was looking forward to Infamous as a companion piece. Forget it. This movie comes off as a poorly-made joke.Infamous has none of the gravitas, humanity or insight seen in the earlier film. What humor it has is without any subtlety, and pops up in the most outrageous places. Characters are weakly introduced and disappear again, leaving only a shallow impression. The actor who plays Capote does look strikingly like him, but interesting enough, Hoffman's Capote was more effective, more real. He worried less about ""the look"", and instead gave a performance of intelligence and fragility, and heart.Infamous took an ugly and ridiculous turn with the introduction of Perry Smith. This Perry was so over-the-top, especially compared to Clifton Collins' nuanced and heartbreaking portrayal of Smith , that it was almost insulting.There were just so many bad aspects to this movie that it's hard to touch on them all. From the off-handed capture of the killers, to the bland cinematography, to the inappropriate humor, Infamous is a mess.

1042960,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B000M341SC,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[7, 7]",".On November 15, 1959, the four members of the Herbert Clutter household in rural western Kansas were slain by two drifters recently out of prison in search of money from a loaded family safe that didn't exist.  Author Truman Capote set out for Kansas (primarily the village of Holcomb, where the Clutters lived and nearby Garden City, the county seat and setting for law enforcement and trial) shortly thereafter with a commission for a NEW YORKER article about the area's reaction to the slayings, but carried on to write a book that spanned the 1959-1965 years between the murder, the arrest of drifters Dick Hickock and Perry Smith, and their eventual execution by hanging.  The researching and writing of IN COLD BLOOD (1966) produced a ""nonfiction novel"" and a smash publishing success, in which Capote scrupulously kept himself out of the picture.  But in the 2000's two movies both focused on Capote and his research and writing during the research and writing of IN COLD BLOOD, making-of works that both spanned the entire 1959-1965 period.  These two films tell the same story but in different ways.  CAPOTE (2005) was the first released, and it earned Philip Seymour Hoffman an Oscar playing the title character.  But the second release, INFAMOUS (2006), though sometimes condemned to runner-up status mere accident of release date, deserves to be considered on its own merits.INFAMOUS is officially based on colleague and fellow Glitterati member George Plimpton's memoirs, the one with the impossibly long title (Truman Capote: In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career) - the book includes not only the author's recollections on Capote but numerous interviews with those who knew him.  Author/screenwriter Douglas McGrath also had available the many taped Capote interviews from Dick Cavett's talk show.  CAPOTE, on the other hand, has as its authorized source reference Chapters 38 through 41 of Gerald Clarke's outstanding 1988 CAPOTE:  A BIOGRAPHY.  This difference in content shows up in the movies' construction and to some extent their themes. CAPOTE is more of a great-man literary biopic, with stately, enormous prairie long shots and well-crafted widescreen interiors impeccably mise-en-scene'd with  two- and three-shots: a triumph of pacing and chronology.  In INFAMOUS the plot is enlivened by talking-heads interviews of Capote's friends, including his high-society ""swans"" (Capote's term, meaning wealthy society ladies like Babe Paley or Diana Vreeland) and other supporting characters from New York's movers-and-shakers: its charms are of clever montage and juxtaposition.  CAPOTE has the advantage of a more detailed, event-detail-oriented plot; many of the same quotes and references make it into INFAMOUS, too, but generally at lesser length.My major gripe about CAPOTE is not any deficiency of quality, but that the film is almost totally bereft of humor. Being the statelier of the two films, one doesn't expect regular comic relief, but the film's tone turns out almost relentlessly downbeat.  Location shooting in Manitoba apparently caught not a single unclouded day; only a shot of Capote's summer home in the Spanish Mediterranean shows clear blue skies.  Like the house Herb Clutter designed, CAPOTE errs on the ""sensible and sedate"" (Capote's description from IN COLD BLOOD), perhaps because it includes more of the language of Clarke's immensely well-researched biography.  Catherine Keener as Nelle Harper Lee, Capote's research assistant of the time just before the publication of her literary sensation IN COLD BLOOD, rarely if ever cracks a smile.  In INFAMOUS, Sandra Bullock plays Lee, here as well moral center of the story (one observer called her Capote's ""Jiminy Cricket""); and while Bullock at the time was the less-experienced actress, her sly humorous truth-telling shines through.  Both films have the same biographically accurate, tragic outcome:  in all the years following 1966, Capote did not complete a full-length work, and by 1984 he had drunk himself to death.  But INFAMOUS allows some comic relief along the way.For scruplers, neither film is a 100-percent literal documentary: redaction and compression in both occur.  Both films include the vital scene of Truman and Nelle being invited to Clutter-murder lead Investigator Alvin Dewey's house for Christmas dinner, 1959 (in the telling a surprise Dewey's New Orleans-born wife sprang on her spouse who had, like most townspeople, been appalled by Capote's effeminacy and androgynous-looking fur coat and trailing designer scarf). This Christmas entr&eacute;e broke the social and professional ice for Capote and Harper Lee, who went on to socialize with and interview the law enforcement community and bourgeoisie in Garden City, whose cooperation was vital to Capote's research.  The successful social outcome did occur but in actual fact, it was the wife of the Clutter family lawyer who impulsively invited the stranded New Yorkers for Christmas day; the Deweys were one of numerous Garden City couples who followed suit. (For substantiation, consult either Gerald Clarke's Capote biography or INFAMOUS' excellent Commentary by Douglas McGrath.)In some cases, the black-and-white movie of IN COLD BLOOD (1967) contained more documentary realism and more verisimilitude than the biopics filmed nearly 20 years later despite their larger budgets.  The ""celebrated expresses"" (Capote again) like the Super Chief and El Capitan were still roaring through the Clutter's hamlet of Holcomb in 1967 as they had in 1959; filming them was literal and easy.  But by the middle of the 2000's, Santa-Fe operated passenger trains had not plied the rails in over 40 years, their function having been assumed by Amtrak.  The biopics have to fake a train, and the manner in which they chose to fake it is illustrative:  CAPOTE, with some struggle, got an evocative super-long shot of an indistinguishable Canadian passenger train horizontally crossing the prairie horizon at twilight.  But INFAMOUS, more to its wont, went for humor, photographing what appear to be 1920s wooden museum coaches with opening windows, inaccurate red paint and even the railroad's name not spelled out properly that then dumped Capote and Harper on a wooden platform in the middle of nowhere.  As a train fan I am annoyed at the breach of the Super Chief's legendary streamlined luxury that, ironically, Capote and Lee both enjoyed along the way to Kansas, but I do have to admit the take was funny and got a huge laugh in theaters.It's interesting that each film goes to some trouble to cast at least one important character to the right size of actor, but each film violates that precept too:  CAPOTE cast the medium-sized (5'8"", 1.73m) Clifton Collins, Jr., as short-statured Perry, while INFAMOUS cast Perry with the taller (5'10"", 1.78m) Daniel Craig, a notably muscular, even hunky, actor who went on to play 007 in a string of James Bond pictures.  To play Capote, INFAMOUS made good use of the diminutive British actor Toby Jones, who perfected Capote's southern/urban drawl and related the man's banty-rooster's feistiness with well-crafted body English such as a leading ""bulldog"" chin.  While Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting as the lead character in CAPOTE is never less than top-notch, and I don't begrudge him his Oscar, the fact remains that the actor is seven inches taller than the ""Tiny Terror,"" with a more substantial frame.  Once Hoffman locks his character in, moreover, his Capote becomes one of gravitas less characteristic of the impulsive and exuberant Capote of the times.The central conflict in INFAMOUS (and CAPOTE) is co-killer Perry Smith's reluctance to tell Capote the details of the murder; there the tension was psychological, or even psycho-sexual, and neither film tries to be funny.  In CAPOTE, Perry was understandably upset when he learned Truman's book was to be titled IN COLD BLOOD after Capote had denied it, and Collins captures his character's gathering depression quite nicely.  In INFAMOUS Perry was visibly agitated and a little violent upon learning of Capote's lie, and he really went berserk in a later scene when Truman volunteered that his mother, like Perry's, had committed suicide.  Perry believed he was being lied to again and grabbed the much slighter Toby/Capote from behind in a symbolic anal rape, which nearly became actual when he began to wrestle Truman's pants off.  The author's prior duplicity got him his comeuppance; The Tiny Terror was himself terrified.  This pays off dramatically because INFAMOUS had allowed a simmering stream of underlying homoeroticism to develop between the two men, or at least implied the same, leading to Craig/Perry's act of physical dominance.  This also reinforces the ""changeling"" aspect of Perry that Capote dwelt on at great length in the pages of IN COLD BLOOD, the flashfire rage that abetted the Clutter murders.  In both films, the unusual fascination Capote and Perry Smith held for each other (""deep calling to deep"" as Nelle Harper Lee said) stirred up the childhood demons that Capote could no longer pin down; in INFAMOUS Perry's motivation is more specifically homophobic but both characters in both films depend on a doppelganger in their mutual abusive childhoods.  We may never know all the nuances.The point is gently made that while Capote's gayness was essential to his personality, homosexuality itself was not his downfall.  Both films establish Capote's active homosexual life by bringing it up, and then putting it in context.  CAPOTE  uses a classic Hollywood opening exposition, a scene set in an overcrowded Manhattan cocktail-party during which, among other things, Capote contrasts his own homosexuality to the kind in James Baldwin's new ""problem novel"" GIOVANNI'S ROOM . . .  clearly establishing that for Capote sexuality was no problem.  INFAMOUS holds confirmation out for longer, and then goes for a gag [I'll clean up the language]: the first time Capote went to prison to see convicted killers Dick and Perry, he got a lot of ""Bite me"" type remarks while walking by the caged inmates, to which he replied, ""I never snack,"" and just kept walking.  This got the SECOND biggest laugh in the theater!  **END SPOILERS**Perhaps the interested DVD viewer will want to see INFAMOUS or CAPOTE both, in any order.  The merits of the film version of IN COLD BLOOD, also on DVD, must be mentioned.  But to get the whole story, buy and read the book IN COLD BLOOD (1966), which is a landmark now, as it was 45 years ago.  To get the story behind the story, as well as Capote's entire life, I very highly recommend Gerald Clarke's magnificent CAPOTE: A BIOGRAPHY (1988) which is written with the same kind of care and immense factuality as Capote's landmark book.  CAPOTE has two Commentary tracks and INFAMOUS only one, by writer/director Douglas McGrath, but it is superior to either of CAPOTE's - one of the best DVD commentaries I've heard that deals thoroughly with production values, screenplay, the film's themes and the circumstances of filming (largely in Austin, Texas)..",5,"Two films, yoked by story but separated by storytelling",1306281600,"05 25,

I was blown away at how all around good this was!Granted it unfortunately came out after the wonderful Capote and I admit I did not see it at the movies, which is actually a blessing because I would have missed out on the completely engrossing and informative directors commentary! Do not skip that! After you see the movie and the complex meanings have seeped into your consciousness, watch that commentary.The actor Toby who channeled Capote was mesmerizing.

Never before a murder had the focus of a genius writer in such a way that led to brilliant ""reportage"". Many things were written and several movies focused on the murders and, recently, on the writer - the eclectic, socialite and excentric genius Truman Capote.This is one of them, and you will not want to miss it. Toby Jones is an excellent actor and it's impossible to distinguish him from the real thing! With a deluxe set of supporting cast, including Sandra Bullock, Daniel Craig, Jeff Bridges and Sigourney Weaver, you have everything to make a very good movie, and the director didn't disapointed the audience.Obviously the ""Capote"" movie stole almost all the glory this very good film could get. If ""Infamous"" had went to the theaters in 2004 probably most people knew this movie and most would had never heard of ""Capote"", although it is also a great work!This film is somewhat humorous, although not light and quite dramatic in several moments; it focus on the past life of both the assassin Perry Smith and the writer investigator Truman Capote, and the events that led them to their present situation, demeanor and way of thinking. Also the manipulative aspect of Truman ain't forgot nor the masterful way he gossips and gathers information.Also another brilliant aspect of this movie is the interaction with the locals and the fascinating charisma of the character in social events (even in the country) - a must see.The romantic aspect between Truman and Perry is also much more relevant in this film, and also the ""interpretation"" of the authors downfall.

1042963,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B000M341SC,Annie Van Auken,"[5, 6]","The 2006 biopic INFAMOUS, likeCAPOTE(2005) covers a chapter in writer Truman Capote's life; i.e. his ""reportage"" (as Tru liked to say) of a brutal quadruple homicide in a small Kansas town, exhaustive investigations that ultimately led to the 1966 publication of the crime classic,IN COLD BLOOD.This film is superior to CAPOTE in these respects: Toby Jones is the reincarnation of Capote in height, face and voice. Watch this man for 30 seconds and you'll forget it's an actor and not Capote himself. He's THAT good! Also, an outstanding supporting cast that features Sandra Bullock as Harper Lee, Sigourney Weaver as Babe Paley and Gwyneth Paltrow as nighclub singer Kitty Dean (Paltrow is fabulous!). Finally, there's Jeff Daniels as Kansas investigator Al Dewey, Isabella Rossellini as Marella Agnelli, and almost as amazing as Jones, Peter Bogdonovich is the spittin' image of publisher/writer Bennett Cerf. (Who knew Bog could act?)INFAMOUS isn't perfect of course. There's a refusal to paint Capote as a back-stabbing friendship destroyer (as gigantic Philip Hoffman did so well in his Oscar-winning turn), although we do see an incident of mischievous gossiping. The script also injects some arguably superfluous man love (both tender and violent) into the story. It's clear that Tru's loyalty to Perry Smith prevents his total honesty, yet no mention is made that Smith probably killed all four victims, which varies from Capote's ultimate book description and crime scenario as depicted here. Finally, Tru's obsession over Smith and resultant alcoholic dissipation after the murderer's hanging is a P.S.ed afterthought.Nonetheless, Toby Jones IS Truman Capote, and no matter any differences or similarities to the previous year's Hoffman turn, this one stands on its own as a darn good movie!

This movie is the story of Truman Capote (brilliantly played by Toby Jones) and how ""In Cold Blood"" was written.It also makes some of the reasons clear why Capote called his book a novel, not straight reporting. He put words in people's mouths, words that mattered to the story. For example, ""In Cold Blood"" says that Perry tried to apologize before he died; that his last words were ""I'd like to apologize, but I don't know who to apologize to."" But ""Infamous"" quotes the DA on the case that Perry never said a word, he just chewed his gum. However, Capote suggested his last words to him, and so wrote in the book that Perry said what he suggested he say.Harper Lee (real name Nell) was Capote's friend from childhood. Capote was that scrawny little boy who lived next door in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" So when Truman decided to go to Kansas and talk to people, Nell went along with him. Truman was trying to get a magazine article out of the murders as about how the town felt, the way they reacted to such a brutal, apparently motiveless murder. But people thought he was odd (queer? eccentric?), and wouldn't talk to him until one kind lady invited him to her home for Christmas, referring to Nell as ""Mrs. Capote."" They accepted, and when Truman started name-dropping about all the famous people he knew, they thawed out.Then the killers were captured, and Capote realized this was going to be a book, not just a magazine article. Dick agreed to talk to him as soon as Truman offered to send a share of the royalties to Dick's kids by his first marriage. But Perry had no family to care about the money, and he held out until Truman's persistence and sympathy convinced him to open up. After that, he was ""friend Truman,"" and Perry wrote two letters to him every week for the five years during which his appeal was going through the courts. When the appeals were all denied, he asked Capote to attend the hanging.It was the hardest thing he had ever done. They hung Dick first, and the executioner kept checking for a heart beat with a stethoscope. It took him some 40 minutes to die. When Perry was on the gallows and the executioner put a black bag over his head, Truman could bear it no longer, and ran out of the execution room (really a warehouse or barn structure) rather than witness the final moments.Truman Capote never wrote a significant work after that.

1042967,A20IIR0422G3A5,B000M341SC,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[6, 8]","`Infamous', written and directed by Douglas McGrath, based on the book `Truman Capote' by George Plimpton is a doppelganger (sorry, no umlaut available) to the somewhat earlier movie `Capote', with the title character famously played in an Academy Award winning performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Both films start with Capote's reading about the Clutter murder in The New York Times and both films end with the execution of the two murderers and the publication of the `non-fiction novel', `In Cold Blood'.I can tick off so many things I like about `Infamous' that one wonders why it languishes while its earlier twin revels in glory. Part of the story may simply be that like the `Dangerous Liaisons' / `Valmont' pair of movies of a few years back, `Dangerous Liaisons' came out first; however, it also had the far superior cast and somewhat better writing, even though the two movies were adapted from the identical 19th century French novel.The most important comparison, of course, is between Hoffman and Toby Jones, who portrays Capote in this movie. It's easy to understand why Hoffman got the Oscar, since it was such a stretch for the tallish actor to play the diminutive Capote, while Jones required virtually no camera trickery to have him appear as the 5' 6'' writer. Jones also seems to have the same roundish face. So, as far as the lead roles go, I think it's a photo finish, with the edge going to Hoffman for the fact that he had to work harder to fit the part. When we get to the supporting cast, things look MUCH different. Sandra Bullock's portrayal of Capote's close friend and author of `To Kill a Mockingbird', Tess Harper Lee is truly remarkable, especially when you compare it to so many of her other roles. Next in importance is Daniel Craig as Perry Smith. In `Capote', a relative unknown played this role, and absolutely nothing sticks in my memory about this performance. Craig, the new James Bond, on the other hand demonstrates the kind of acting which made him stand out as the first real challenge to Sean Connery in the Bond role. `Infamous' explores aspects of Perry's character that were not even touched in `Capote'. And, there are some prison scenes between Perry and Capote which surprise us in the extreme, and reveal a connection between the two men which `Capote' doesn't even hint at. The one role where `Capote' has the advantage is with the character of the local police chief. While `Infamous' Jeff Daniels does an excellent job, he just doesn't seem to fit the part as well as Chris Cooper in `Capote'.From this point, all the rest of the character portrayals seem to be fairly comparable, albeit just a bit different. Where `Capote's primary literary business figure is `The New Yorker' editor, Wallace Shawn, played by Bob Balaban, `Infamous' has Random House president Bennett Cerf, played by Peter Bogdonivich. In support is an amazing list of actresses, Hope Davis, Gwyneth Paltrow, Isabella Rossellini, Juliet Stevenson, and Sigourney Weaver in minor roles, serving as witnesses to Capote's personality. These characters are used in much the same way as Warren Beatty used his `witnesses' in `Reds' or, in a wildly different context, as Woody Allen used them in `Annie Hall'.These talking heads do contribute an amazing amount of detail and understanding of Capote to the movie. When I reviewed `Capote', I remarked on the amazing lack of narrative in a book about a famous writer. This movie suffers from no such problem; however, some people may have to tax their memories a bit to recall who Babe Palley (wife of CBS chairman William Palley) and Bennett Cerf were in their own time.Near the end of the film, the Capote character says that an author takes the pain of life and transforms it into art. While there is certainly much art in this film, it seems to reflect reveal much more of the pain which comprises the raw material of the art, while `Capote' does more to celebrate many of the more artistic aspects of the cinematic craft.This DVD includes a director's voice-over commentary that, for me, easily doubles the value of the DVD. Should you be inclined to own one of these films, I suggest you get both, as they are far closer in quality than the lopsided contest between `Dangerous Liaisons' and `Valmont'.",5,"More Literate and revealing than 'Capote', less cinematic.",1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,4277,"['Infamous', 'written', 'directed', 'Douglas', 'McGrath', 'based', 'book', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'George', 'Plimpton', 'doppelganger', 'sorry', 'umlaut', 'available', 'somewhat', 'earlier', 'movie', 'Capote', 'title', 'character', 'famously', 'played', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'performance', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'films', 'start', 'Capote', 'reading', 'Clutter', 'murder', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'films', 'end', 'execution', 'two', 'murderers', 'publication', 'non-fiction', 'novel', 'Cold', ""Blood'.I"", 'can', 'tick', 'off', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'like', 'Infamous', 'one', 'why', 'earlier', 'twin', 'revels', 'glory', 'Part', 'story', 'may', 'simply', 'be', 'Dangerous', 'Liaisons', '/', 'Valmont', 'pair', 'movies', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Dangerous', 'Liaisons', 'came', 'first', 'however', 'also', 'had', 'far', 'superior', 'cast', 'somewhat', 'better', 'writing', 'even', 'two', 'movies', 'were', 'adapted', 'identical', '19th', 'century', 'French', 'most', 'important', 'comparison', 'course', 'Hoffman', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'who', 'Capote', 'movie', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'Hoffman', 'got', 'Oscar', 'was', 'such', 'stretch', 'tallish', 'actor', 'play', 'diminutive', 'Capote', 'Jones', 'required', 'virtually', 'camera', 'trickery', 'have', 'appear', '5', '6', 'writer', 'Jones', 'also', 'have', 'same', 'roundish', 'face', 'So', 'as', 'far', 'lead', 'roles', 'go', 'think', 'photo', 'finish', 'edge', 'going', 'Hoffman', 'fact', 'had', 'work', 'harder', 'fit', 'part', 'When', 'get', 'supporting', 'cast', 'things', 'look', 'MUCH', 'different', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'portrayal', 'Capote', 'close', 'friend', 'author', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'especially', 'when', 'compare', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'roles', 'Next', 'importance', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Capote', 'relative', 'unknown', 'played', 'role', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'sticks', 'memory', 'performance', 'Craig', 'new', 'James', 'Bond', 'other', 'hand', 'kind', 'acting', 'made', 'stand', 'out', 'first', 'real', 'challenge', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Bond', 'role', 'Infamous', 'explores', 'aspects', 'Perry', 'character', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'touched', 'Capote', 'are', 'prison', 'scenes', 'Perry', 'Capote', 'surprise', 'extreme', 'reveal', 'connection', 'two', 'men', 'Capote', ""n't"", 'even', 'hint', 'one', 'role', 'where', 'Capote', 'advantage', 'character', 'local', 'police', 'chief', 'Infamous', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'excellent', 'job', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'part', 'as', 'well', 'Chris', 'Cooper', ""Capote'.From"", 'point', 'rest', 'character', 'portrayals', 'seem', 'be', 'fairly', 'comparable', 'albeit', 'just', 'bit', 'different', 'Where', 'Capote', 'primary', 'literary', 'business', 'figure', 'New', 'Yorker', 'editor', 'Wallace', 'Shawn', 'played', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'Infamous', 'Random', 'House', 'president', 'Bennett', 'Cerf', 'played', 'Peter', 'Bogdonivich', 'support', 'amazing', 'list', 'actresses', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'minor', 'roles', 'serving', 'witnesses', 'Capote', 'personality', 'characters', 'are', 'used', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'used', 'witnesses', 'Reds', 'wildly', 'different', 'context', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'used', 'Annie', ""Hall'.These"", 'talking', 'heads', 'do', 'contribute', 'amazing', 'amount', 'detail', 'understanding', 'Capote', 'movie', 'When', 'reviewed', 'Capote', 'remarked', 'amazing', 'lack', 'narrative', 'book', 'famous', 'writer', 'movie', 'suffers', 'such', 'problem', 'however', 'people', 'may', 'have', 'tax', 'memories', 'bit', 'recall', 'who', 'Babe', 'Palley', 'wife', 'CBS', 'chairman', 'William', 'Palley', 'Bennett', 'Cerf', 'were', 'own', 'end', 'film', 'Capote', 'character', 'author', 'pain', 'life', 'transforms', 'art', 'certainly', 'much', 'art', 'film', 'reflect', 'reveal', 'much', 'more', 'pain', 'raw', 'material', 'art', 'Capote', 'more', 'celebrate', 'many', 'more', 'artistic', 'aspects', 'cinematic', 'craft.This', 'DVD', 'director', 'voice-over', 'commentary', 'easily', 'value', 'DVD', 'Should', 'be', 'inclined', 'own', 'one', 'films', 'suggest', 'get', 'are', 'far', 'closer', 'quality', 'lopsided', 'contest', 'Dangerous', 'Liaisons', 'Valmont']",N/A

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 11]","Comparisons between films on the same subject are usually separated by decades rather than one year, but last year's CAPOTE (2005), starring Philip Seymour Hoffman is now being shadowed by the 2006 release of this film, INFAMOUS. And shadowed is the operative word here, simply because Capote towers both in acting and cohesive story structure over Infamous.Probably the biggest issue with Infamous is its piecemealing together of the various story threads, giving the entire production a herky-jerky feel to it. Also, taking nothing away from Toby Jones's performance as the effeminate Capote, Philip Seymour Hoffman pulled in a finer performance thanks to a much smoother flowing storyline.The best acting part in Infamous would have to be Daniel Craig's portrayal of Perry Smith, one of the murderers whom Truman Capote gets close to in order to finish his greatly successful novel, In Cold Blood. A novel that not only makes Truman Capote but breaks him as well, for he wrote nothing up to that standard for the rest of his life. Clifton Collins Jr. did an admirable job as Perry in the film Capote, but Craig stuns and surprises after seeing his gruff debonair-ness in the wildly successful CASINO ROYALE (2006).Another problem with Infamous is that there are some big name actors/actresses in it if for no other reason than to say, ""Hey. There are some big name actors/actresses in this movie."" Jeff Daniels, Sigourney Weaver, Gwyneth Paltrow, Isabella Rossellini, Hope Davis, and a slew of others lend their names but not much of their talent to the film. A shame, too, as many of them are fine actors/actresses. Jeff Daniels might be the exception in that list, but not by much.Certainly there are some entertaining portions to the film, especially whenever the social elite reveal secrets to one another (especially to Truman who is their constant confidant) and promise not to spread it around ...and then inevitably do the very moment they get a chance. That was quite entertaining. But, as a whole, the story's script flagged horribly in the end, never really making the viewer care about any of these once vibrantly active people (murderer and social butterfly alike).

1042970,A3I7YI4NMP6SV8,B000M341SC,"B. Wells ""CineMan""","[5, 5]","Released nearly a year after Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar-winning turn in ""Capote"", Douglas McGrath's overlooked ""Infamous"" (based on George Plimpton's bestseller) covers, essentially, the same territory while remaining uniquey different from its predecessor.Star Toby Jones has the right look for the late author, and certainly has his mannerisms down pat.  More spritely, less acerbic, and less dissipated than the Capote inhabited by Hoffman, Jones has an almost wholesome winsomness that seems to be counter to most of what I've read about the real-life Capote.  And while Hoffman's performance seemed to come from some dark and painful place deep within (and may, thus, seem more genuine), Jones' Capote is much more fun to watch. I think his portrayal comes closer to humanizing the fascinating ""tiny terror"", whose association with a notorious murder case and its perpetrators helped lead to his own downward spiral into disgrace and notoriety.  As best friend and fellow author, Nell Harper Lee, Sandra Bullock continues to refine her acting skills, proving that her outstanding performance in ""Crash"" was no fluke.  Alternately disapproving and supportive, her Nell is Truman's rock, his anchor in the often turbulent waters of his own life; she's strong and sensible, with the only problem being a Southern accent that is sorely unconvincing.  As Truman's high-society ""swans"" from New York, Sigourney Weaver (Babe Paley), Hope Davis (Slim Keith), and Isabella Rosellini (Marella Agnelli) provide a Greek chorus of tea and sympathy for Truman's ongoing dramas.  The delightful Juliet Stevenson delivers a nice turn as the fabulous Diana Vreeland, and Peter Bogdanovich is also fine as publisher and Capote confidante, Bennet Cerf. Character actor John Benjamin Hickey, as Capote's partner, Jack Dunphy, brings a lost and bittersweet edge to the film's goings-on, while Jeff Daniels, as lawman Alvin Dewey, lends the movie an element of strength and steadiness.Of course, it is the killers of ""In Cold Blood"" who amp up the element of drama in both ""Capote"" and in ""Infamous"".  Lee Pace (of ""Pushing Daisies"") is suitably scary as cold and matter-of-fact Dick Hickock, who killed without remorse, and then never shut up talking about it.  But, conveying both the chilling barbarism and wounded sensitivity of murderous Perry Smith, while noting his similarities to Truman, is essential to successfully presenting a certain dichotomy that has probably rarely existed between an author and his interview subject. Robert Blake (in Richard Brooks' ""In Cold Blood"") epitomized the limping, pathetic Smith, humanizing him yet presenting him in a very real, warts-and-all way; Clifton Collins, in ""Capote"", though prettied-up, was also believable in the same role.  In ""Infamous"", no less than 007 actor, Daniel Craig, assays the role of Perry Smith, with, I think, less successful results.  He's an outstanding actor but too much of a movie star for this role; his glamour surrounds the Smith character with an aura that ultimately glamourizes the killer, imbuing him with an artificiality that dashes any hopes of bringing honesty or any real level of understanding to this most complex of characters.  The physicality between the two men and the suggestion of a jailhouse affair between Capote and Smith also strains credulity, and the sexual dynamics seem false and forced.  This brings an air of dishonesty to the Capote/Smith scenes, which, ultimately doesn't play well.  The Clutters themselves--the Kansas farm family slain by Hickock and Smith in a bungled robbery attempt--are barely shown, and I was thankful for that.  While the killings are briefly covered, the brutality of the crimes is not as much in evidence as it was in the previous films.Except for the slaughter of the innocent family, there is nothing subtle about ""Infamous"".  From its weirdly flaky opening (with Gwyneth Paltrow as a lounge singer) to the flambuoyant lead character to the fluttering socialites, everything seems designed to SHOUT to the viewer, to PROJECT  to the audience sitting in the rafters.  At times, ""Infamous"" seems much more like a stage play than a movie, and all this accomplishes is to make the film seem more rough than its predecessors.  While there are problems with this movie, I still like it, mostly for Toby Jones' winning performance, however broad it may be.",3,The Tiny Terror and a Sensitive Bogeyman,1227744000,"11 27, 2008",2008,4376,"['Released', 'nearly', 'year', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Oscar-winning', 'turn', 'Capote', 'Douglas', 'McGrath', 'overlooked', 'Infamous', 'based', 'George', 'Plimpton', 'bestseller', 'covers', 'essentially', 'same', 'territory', 'remaining', 'uniquey', 'different', 'predecessor.Star', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'right', 'look', 'late', 'author', 'certainly', 'mannerisms', 'down', 'pat', 'More', 'spritely', 'less', 'acerbic', 'less', 'dissipated', 'Capote', 'inhabited', 'Hoffman', 'Jones', 'almost', 'wholesome', 'winsomness', 'be', 'counter', 'most', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'real-life', 'Capote', 'Hoffman', 'performance', 'seemed', 'come', 'dark', 'painful', 'place', 'deep', 'may', 'thus', 'seem', 'more', 'genuine', 'Jones', 'Capote', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'think', 'portrayal', 'closer', 'humanizing', 'fascinating', 'tiny', 'terror', 'association', 'notorious', 'murder', 'case', 'perpetrators', 'helped', 'lead', 'own', 'downward', 'spiral', 'disgrace', 'notoriety', 'best', 'friend', 'fellow', 'author', 'Nell', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'refine', 'acting', 'skills', 'proving', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Crash', 'was', 'fluke', 'Alternately', 'disapproving', 'supportive', 'Nell', 'Truman', 'rock', 'anchor', 'often', 'turbulent', 'waters', 'own', 'life', 'strong', 'sensible', 'only', 'problem', 'being', 'Southern', 'accent', 'sorely', 'unconvincing', 'Truman', 'high-society', 'swans', 'New', 'York', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Babe', 'Paley', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'Slim', 'Keith', 'Isabella', 'Rosellini', 'Marella', 'Agnelli', 'provide', 'Greek', 'chorus', 'tea', 'sympathy', 'Truman', 'ongoing', 'dramas', 'delightful', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'nice', 'turn', 'fabulous', 'Diana', 'Vreeland', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'also', 'fine', 'publisher', 'Capote', 'confidante', 'Bennet', 'Cerf', 'Character', 'actor', 'John', 'Benjamin', 'Hickey', 'Capote', 'partner', 'Jack', 'Dunphy', 'lost', 'bittersweet', 'edge', 'film', 'goings-on', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'lawman', 'Alvin', 'Dewey', 'movie', 'element', 'strength', 'steadiness.Of', 'course', 'killers', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'who', 'amp', 'up', 'element', 'drama', 'Capote', 'Infamous', 'Lee', 'Pace', 'Pushing', 'Daisies', 'suitably', 'scary', 'cold', 'matter-of-fact', 'Dick', 'Hickock', 'who', 'killed', 'remorse', 'then', 'never', 'shut', 'up', 'talking', 'conveying', 'chilling', 'barbarism', 'wounded', 'sensitivity', 'murderous', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'noting', 'similarities', 'Truman', 'essential', 'successfully', 'presenting', 'certain', 'dichotomy', 'probably', 'rarely', 'existed', 'author', 'interview', 'subject', 'Robert', 'Blake', 'Richard', 'Brooks', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'epitomized', 'limping', 'pathetic', 'Smith', 'humanizing', 'yet', 'presenting', 'very', 'real', 'warts-and-all', 'way', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Capote', 'prettied-up', 'was', 'also', 'believable', 'same', 'role', 'Infamous', 'less', '007', 'actor', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'role', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'think', 'less', 'successful', 'results', 'outstanding', 'actor', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'star', 'role', 'glamour', 'Smith', 'character', 'aura', 'ultimately', 'killer', 'imbuing', 'artificiality', 'hopes', 'bringing', 'honesty', 'real', 'level', 'understanding', 'most', 'complex', 'characters', 'physicality', 'two', 'men', 'suggestion', 'jailhouse', 'affair', 'Capote', 'Smith', 'also', 'credulity', 'sexual', 'dynamics', 'seem', 'false', 'forced', 'air', 'dishonesty', 'Capote/Smith', 'scenes', 'ultimately', ""n't"", 'play', 'well', 'Clutters', 'Kansas', 'farm', 'family', 'slain', 'Hickock', 'Smith', 'bungled', 'robbery', 'attempt', 'are', 'barely', 'shown', 'was', 'thankful', 'killings', 'are', 'briefly', 'covered', 'brutality', 'crimes', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'evidence', 'was', 'previous', 'films.Except', 'slaughter', 'innocent', 'family', 'nothing', 'subtle', 'Infamous', 'weirdly', 'flaky', 'opening', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'lounge', 'singer', 'flambuoyant', 'lead', 'character', 'fluttering', 'everything', 'designed', 'SHOUT', 'viewer', 'PROJECT', 'audience', 'sitting', 'rafters', 'times', 'Infamous', 'much', 'more', 'stage', 'play', 'movie', 'make', 'film', 'seem', 'more', 'rough', 'predecessors', 'are', 'problems', 'movie', 'still', 'mostly', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'winning', 'performance', 'however', 'broad', 'may', 'be']",N/A

I bought it two or three years ago for the Kindle, started to read, but was sidetracked.  While I was probably half way through the last time -- I am on the last 30 pages this time -- I realized that I needed to start from the beginning again as I had forgotten so much about the book.  While the novel has some issues, it is a terrific read.I have also seen the film ""In Cold Blood,"" which I really liked, and watched ""Capote"" several years ago.  I liked both of those films, and after watching Philip Seymour Hoffman in the latter version, I thought to myself, ""I will never see a better interpretation of Truman Capote.  EVER.""  Boy, was I wrong.No disrespect to Mr. Hoffman, but Toby Jones just absolutely nails it here.  While Mr. Hoffman was very accurate with Mr. Capote's voice, Mr. Jones one ups him by accurately portraying the mannerisms -- and psyche -- of Mr. Capote.  I was literally blown away by Mr. Jones' performance here, especially after I read quite a bit of side material about how the townspeople of Holcomb actually felt about Mr. Capote.  (Most of them, to this day, didn't like the famous writer.  I can see both sides of this issue myself, and it would require too many pages of writing to say why.)  But I believe that Mr. Hoffman was surprisingly somewhat sabotaged by the writing and direction in ""Capote.""  While it was really good, they were afraid to take risks.  The writer and director were not afraid to take those same risks here, and there is a huge payoff because of it.  Suffice it to say that the interaction between the Capote character and one of the killers is chilling and realistic.  (And by the way:  casting Daniel Craig was a truly inspired choice here.)If you liked ""Capote"" you will love ""Infamous.""

1042973,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000M341SC,C. B Collins Jr.,"[3, 3]","This is certainly a highly entertaining film. Toby Jones is very convincing and funny as Truman Capote. Yet, unfortunately it was released around the same time as that masterpiece of film, Capote, also about the rise and fall of this American writer. Toby Jones plays a campy Capote, trying to use gay camp humor to open doors. This is dramatically different from the manner in which Seymour Hoffman plays Capote in the film of that name. In Capote, the character of Truman opens doors by careful and strategic revelation of vulnerability which in turn allows the person with whom he is talking to begin to open up and express thier own vulnerability, feeling that they are in a safe space. At the very beginning of the film, an actor, playing the role of Gore Vidal, says that Truman Capote talked just the way a brussel sprout would talk if a brussel sprout could talk. This is a perfect description of the way that Toby Jones selected to play Capote.Infamous is interesting in the way that it integrates the bleak Kansas landscape where a family was murdered with Capote's life among America's wealthy jet-set power-broker women-friends. The film Capote selects to focus primarily on events in Kansas and this minimal approach actually hightens the drama and the tragedy.Homosexuality in Capote is subtle and implied in the character of Perry Smith. However in the film Infamous, Daniel Craig masterfully plays a complex Perry Smith that emerges as a gay man during the five years he awaits execution. Daniel Craig's acting is exceptional and a high point of the film.This leads to the major distinction between the two films. In Infamous, Capote falls in love with Perry Smith and this attraction to Smith helps motivate the production of the book. It is Smith's confession of love that disarms Capote and makes the hanging death of Smith tragic. In Capote, the artistic impulse is the driving force behind Truman Capote. When Capote begins to fall in love with Perry Smith, the tragedy is constructed around his dual and ambivalent emotions. If Smith lives, then Capote can't publish his masterpiece. If Perry Smith hangs, then the book can be published but Capote loses his love.In Infamous, after the execution of Perry Smith, Capote is seen as falling apart and disengaging from his social life. In Capote, the fall into alcholism and the isolation is more pronounced and tragic. In the film Infamous, Nelle Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize for To Kill A Mockingbird is a narrative detail. In Capote, it is taken as a stab in the heart to Capote and he distances himself from his childhood friend.Sandra Bullock does a very good job of playing Nelle Harper Lee, primarily by understating the part, speaking with the soft quiet mellow tones of a Southern lady.The unfortunate thing about this film is that it is really excellent but it is almost impossible not to compare it to Capote, an exceptional and rare masterpiece of narrative film.",4,Capote revealed in his dual life.,1184284800,"07 13, 2007",2007,2942,"['certainly', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'very', 'convincing', 'funny', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'Capote', 'also', 'rise', 'fall', 'American', 'writer', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'campy', 'Capote', 'trying', 'use', 'gay', 'camp', 'humor', 'open', 'doors', 'dramatically', 'different', 'manner', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Capote', 'film', 'name', 'Capote', 'character', 'Truman', 'doors', 'careful', 'strategic', 'revelation', 'vulnerability', 'turn', 'person', 'whom', 'talking', 'begin', 'open', 'up', 'express', 'thier', 'own', 'vulnerability', 'feeling', 'are', 'safe', 'space', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'actor', 'playing', 'role', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'talked', 'just', 'way', 'brussel', 'sprout', 'would', 'talk', 'brussel', 'sprout', 'could', 'talk', 'perfect', 'description', 'way', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'selected', 'play', 'Capote.Infamous', 'interesting', 'way', 'bleak', 'Kansas', 'landscape', 'where', 'family', 'was', 'murdered', 'Capote', 'life', 'America', 'wealthy', 'jet-set', 'power-broker', 'women-friends', 'film', 'Capote', 'focus', 'primarily', 'events', 'Kansas', 'minimal', 'approach', 'actually', 'drama', 'tragedy.Homosexuality', 'Capote', 'subtle', 'implied', 'character', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'However', 'film', 'Infamous', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'masterfully', 'complex', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'gay', 'man', 'five', 'years', 'execution', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'acting', 'exceptional', 'high', 'point', 'film.This', 'major', 'distinction', 'two', 'films', 'Infamous', 'Capote', 'love', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'attraction', 'Smith', 'motivate', 'production', 'book', 'Smith', 'confession', 'love', 'Capote', 'hanging', 'death', 'Smith', 'tragic', 'Capote', 'artistic', 'impulse', 'driving', 'force', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'When', 'Capote', 'fall', 'love', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'tragedy', 'constructed', 'dual', 'ambivalent', 'emotions', 'Smith', 'then', 'Capote', 'ca', ""n't"", 'publish', 'masterpiece', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'hangs', 'then', 'book', 'can', 'be', 'published', 'Capote', 'love.In', 'Infamous', 'execution', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Capote', 'seen', 'falling', 'apart', 'disengaging', 'social', 'life', 'Capote', 'fall', 'alcholism', 'isolation', 'more', 'pronounced', 'tragic', 'film', 'Infamous', 'Nelle', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'Kill', 'A', 'Mockingbird', 'narrative', 'detail', 'Capote', 'taken', 'stab', 'heart', 'Capote', 'childhood', 'friend.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'Nelle', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'primarily', 'understating', 'part', 'speaking', 'soft', 'quiet', 'mellow', 'tones', 'Southern', 'lady.The', 'unfortunate', 'thing', 'film', 'really', 'excellent', 'almost', 'impossible', 'not', 'compare', 'Capote', 'exceptional', 'rare', 'masterpiece', 'narrative', 'film']",N/A
1042974,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B000M341SC,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 1]","Unfortunately, Infamous was released in the wake of Capote, which won an Oscar for Phillip Seymour Hoffman. It covers the same ground, the events before and after the publication of Truman Capote's groundbreaking blend of non-fiction journalism with novelistic techniques, In Cold Blood. Hoffman may have won the Oscar, but Toby Jones was no slouch, either. Jones had an advantage over Hoffman, in that he more closely resembled Capote to begin with. He then perfected the voice, and more importantly, the attitude. No one delivers a withering remark or snappy retort like Jones, unless of course, it was Truman Capote himself. Or Gore Vidal.---------------------Gore Vidal: [on Truman's voice] To the lucky person who has never heard it, I can only say: imagine what a brussel sprout would sound like, if a brussel sprout could talk.================================Truman Capote had the wit, but also knew how to be a good listener. There are great scenes with Truman and his many devoted female friends -- his swans. Quite a stellar cast of ladies: Gwyneth Paltrow, Hope Davis, Isabella Rossellini, Sigourney Weaver, and last but least, Sandra Bullock. Toby Jones does a great job of showing how the Capote charm, though outrageously flaming, was able to win over not only the wealthy and glamorous, but also the good people of Kansas, and even a couple of cold blooded killers:---------------------Truman Capote: When you're talking to them, they seem like perfectly nice boys. To be frank, I'm much more concerned for my safety around Norman Mailer.================================Jeff Daniels plays the D.A., Michael Panes was Gore Vidal, film director Peter Bogdanovich plays publisher Bennett Cerf, and Daniel Craig plays the cold blooded killer with an artistic temperament, Perry Smith. Sandra Bullock as Capote's friend, Nelle Harper Lee, author of To Kill a Mockingbird, was the only casting thud. Bullock just didn't work here, and her poor imitation of a Southern accent didn't help. A pity that they didn't use Samantha Morton instead, as originally planned. Gwyneth Paltrow, on the other hand, was quite a surprise, the way she handled Cole Porter's ""What Is This Thing Called Love?"" Not only did she sing it well, but she also made it the dramatic centerpiece of a nightclub act. She was so good as a singer that I thought she was an up-and-coming jazz singer who could also act. I didn't even realize that it was Paltrow, an actor who can really sing.Though there was a lot on offer, Infamous somehow seemed more like a made-for-TV movie than a film. It would be interesting to do a side-by-side comparison with Capote, which I have seen, but a long time ago. On the box they quote one critic who says that Infamous is more fun than Capote. Perhaps they are right. Toby Jones may have been a better Capote than Hoffman, but he made it look too easy. Too easy and fun. No Oscars are awarded for easy and fun.One last bit of Infamous trivia that I can't resist repeating: Sigourney Weaver's first role was in Annie Hall, and also in that cast, Truman Capote.W.

Toby Jones does an incredible job as the bizarre Truman.

1042977,A3J5UO5QMTFSWB,B000M341SC,"Connoisseur Rat ""armchair experientialist""","[11, 13]","Which is really saying something, seeing as the other Capote-related film I saw this week (I forget the title) won a bunch of those Golden Award Statuette Thingies (including Phillip Seymour Hoffman for his slick portrayal of the Tru-man himself).  But seriously, how ticked off must writer/director Douglas McGrath have been when he found out That Other Film was going to hit theaters first, relegating his outstanding piece of moviemaking - which chronicles the exact same period of Capote's life - to the status of sloppy cinematic seconds?  I listened to the entire commentary track hoping to get some info on this, but Mr. McGrath was all class, never mentioning a thing about it (could it be no one has had the heart or the nerve to tell him yet?).  Regardless, I find ""Infamous"" to be the more emotionally satisfying and flat out better biopic for many reasons.First, McGrath and lead actor Toby Jones had better source material from which to mine this particular mix of truth and speculation; for instance, McGrath's friend (and sometimes creative conspirator) Woody Allen introduced him to Dick Cavett, who let Doug and Toby have total access to the decades of tapes of Cavett's talk show, upon which Capote himself was a frequent guest.  Also, Toby's godmother works at a New York City library and through her got to see all of Capote's ""papers"" - actual notebooks written by the man himself, including the one he took to killers Dick Hickock and Perry Smith's final hearing.  To me, these materials, along with the George Plympton book from which the screenplay is adapted (along with Capote's own In Cold Blood, of course), made for more sturdy script construction materials than the Richard Avedon photos, anecdotes and bios that were use to make That Other Film.In addition, McGrath grew up in Midland, TX but has lived in New York City for twenty-six years, so he was/is very comfortable and skilled when it comes to writing about both the small-town Midwest setting in which the ""Cold Blood"" killings occurred as well as that of the bigtime socialite scene of the Manhattan elite.Add to all that the fact that McGrath is no stranger to adapting great novels for the screen (he previously wrote screenplays adapted from Jane Austen's Emma and Charles Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby), and you can see why this was the more charmed and charming Capote project from conception to completion (except for that pesky release date, that is).Oh, and have I mentioned the acting?  Well, funny thing about that.  You would think That Other Film's acting duo of Chris Cooper and Catherine Keener would blow away this movie's more tepid-seeming tandem of Jeff Daniels and Sandra Bullock in any movie, but the latter pair actually make it a close contest by turning in strong performances as the ""foxy"" Alvin Dewey and voice-of-reason (and Pulitzer Prize-winning author) Nelle Harper Lee.  Dazzling luminaries from Gwyneth Paltrow to Sigourney Weaver and Isabella Rossellini add cinematic sparkle to smaller roles as the Manhattan social stars who populate Capote's New York universe.  But the real star of the show is ""New Bond"" Daniel Craig, all but completely transformed behind dark hair and contact lenses, in a powerful and chameleonic command performance as the doomed killer/artist Perry Smith.  Such a potent mix of ferocity and sensitivity, his raw and revealing portrayal is the best (and most surprising) thing about the film.But the screenplay, as I may have mentioned, is also something really quite special - McGrath exhibits tremendous affection for both source material and subject but certainly doesn't pull and punches about the book or the man.  In his director's commentary, he describes the adaptation of any book to the screen: ""you take an engine apart and then you have to put it together inside a smaller car"" ""and when you take it apart - boy, you see how really good they (the authors) are, and how carefully they construct, and how artfully they put their story together.""McGrath displays an almost equally skillful craft in the words he chooses and uses.  The movie itself is structured like the book In Cold Blood (for example, we learn about the crime early in the novel, but don't actually ""see"" the crime until much later).  And the movie's tonal arc mirrors the true-life arc of Truman Capote - it starts out full of boisterous bombast and uproarious joie de vivre (p.s. I have no idea how factually accurate the dialog is or isn't - and frankly I could give a rat's rump, because it's so well written and I was enormously entertained), but then slowly there is more and more sadness until the gloomy and bitter end.  The film's score does an exceptional job in, er, underscoring this tonal transition, as it too moves from a delightful jauntiness, through spare and spacious emotional (and cinematographic) moments, to the more mournful moments at the closing stages - a fantastic job by Rachel Portman, here.Toward the end of the film, Harper Lee offers one of her many ""testimonials"" to Truman: ""One must remember that at the center of any bright flame there's always that little touch of blue.""  Such is an apt description for the movie itself - it burns brilliantly before flickering and fading to its sad finale. But its warmth and beauty will linger in your memory long after the credits roll.  So if you can only see one Capote-related film this week (or this year or this lifetime), I strongly recommend this one.",5,The Best Capote-Related Film I've Seen This Week!,1179100800,"05 14,

1042980,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000M341SC,Craig Matteson,"[6, 6]","This movie is one of those mysteries of Hollywood.  Why we got two movies about Truman Capote's writing of ""In Cold Blood"" is hard to fathom.  If ""Capote"" had not been made, this movie would have been more widely received than it has been.  Let's just admit from the start that ""Capote"" and Philip Seymour Hoffman created the more powerful and charismatic Truman, but Capote is more or less an impression of them man than an embodiment or impersonation of him.  Toby Jones captures the physical presence and the strange way Truman spoke more completely.  However, the Jones version plays more needy and less self-assured (but similarly tortured) than the Seymour Hoffman Truman.  I don't prefer one over the other and enjoyed both.  I have not heard anyone who knew Truman comment on which was more ""accurate"".While both movies deal with Capote's homosexuality in some way, this movie is more frank and takes it further than ""Capote"" does.  Some may find the overt displays of sexuality in this film disturbing, but it is never graphic.  Where in ""Capote"" the relationship between Truman and Perry Smith is dominated by the manipulative writer, the relationship in ""Infamous"" is manipulative and desperate on both sides.  Which it actually was, I do not know.  Does anyone really know since the parties involved are dead?  Would Truman's testimony about it be reliable?  Didn't it change over time?  I love the scene where Truman is recounting something Perry told him and changing it slightly for different groups of people to gauge the effect.  For the book, he chooses the version for effect not accuracy.Sandra Bullock is terrific in her portrayal of Nelle Harper Lee.  Frankly, it was such a delight seeing such a wonderful characterization that I didn't recognize her at first.  Usually she portrays the trademark sunny and goofy character despite the name or plot, and that is enjoyable, but this turn as a character was a real treat.  Jeff Daniels is also very good as the lawman Alvin Dewey who at first denies Truman access and then befriends him and enables Capote's ability to get information for the book.The movie employs a technique of interviewing the characters who knew Truman as if the actors were the people providing insights for a documentary.  Some people have objected to this, but I kind of liked it.I enjoyed this movie and admired its accomplishments.  Is it as strong a movie as ""Capote""?  No.  However, it has some marvelous scenes.  As just a few examples, the scene at the end with Truman going through the things Perry Smith left him is very powerful.  Also, Sigourney Weaver has some marvelous scenes as Babe Paley and shows the powerful emotional connections Truman had with many women throughout his life.

1042981,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000M341SC,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 2]","I went into this film with only the most basic knowledge about Truman Capote and his writing.  I knew he wrote Breakfast at Tiffany's and In Cold Blood, the latter of which was based on a real crime, I knew he was as exceedingly odd little man, and that's about it.  I've never read any of his work, and I haven't seen the film In Cold Blood or 2005's Capote.  As I first began watching Infamous, I found myself wondering how I could possibly sit through almost two hours of a film about this dandyish, hopelessly pretentious man smarming his way through New York high society.  His incredibly annoying voice didn't help, even though it was nowhere near as bothersome as Sandra Bullock's horrible fake Southern accent in her role as Harper Lee.  As the film progressed, though, this strange little man began to grow on me.  By the mid-way point, I was pretty much engrossed in the story, and the ending clinched all five of the stars I have to give this film (which is pretty amazing given the fact that it includes three of my least favorite actresses: Gwyneth Paltrow, Sigourney Weaver, and the aforementioned Sandra Bullock).Obviously, Truman Capote is one of the most complex and fascinating of men.  I certainly won't define the man by the interpretation on display in Infamous (which is based on Douglas McGrath's 1997 oral biography of the man); after all, this is a fictionalized story of a man known for his own obfuscations with the truth.  You can't even look at In Cold Blood with purely objective eyes because Capote relied on memory rather than notes to produce the book.  And, from what I gather, 2005's Capote provides a noticeably different perspective on the man as it tells basically the same story as Infamous, focusing on the writing and later publication of In Cold Blood.  One thing I am sure of is that Toby Jones turns in an absolutely captivating performance as this most inscrutable of characters.  Capote seemed like such a fake in the early scenes, but Toby Jones transformed him into an incredibly human soul long before the end credits began rolling - sympathetic to a significant degree, as some of the flaws in Capote's character manifest themselves, but not without his own emotionally cold-blooded moment here and there.  If nothing else, this Truman Capote is not a man you would want to confide in with your darkest secrets.Infamous gets pretty emotionally complicated once Capote finally gets access to both killers, especially a reluctant Perry Smith (Daniel Craig).  It's a bumpy ride, but the relationship that develops between Smith and Capote serves as the lynchpin of this film.  Infamous dares call it love, although I imagine that is debatable.  Clearly, though, the two men understood one another in ways few others ever did, and that makes the drama of the concluding scenes truly palpable.I find it somewhat ironic that the actual murder that gave rise to In Cold Blood and these two recent films about Truman Capote doesn't seem to generate much interest at all.  Capote, both the myth and the man, towers over his subject matter.  I certainly don't feel as if I know the real Truman Capote after watching this film, but I'm intrigued enough to go and seek out 2005's Capote and see the story of In Cold Blood told from an alternate viewpoint.",5,"Judged solely on its own merits, an excellent film",1181001600,"06 5, 2007",2007,3293,"['went', 'film', 'only', 'most', 'basic', 'knowledge', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'writing', 'knew', 'wrote', 'Breakfast', 'Tiffany', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'latter', 'was', 'based', 'real', 'crime', 'knew', 'was', 'exceedingly', 'odd', 'little', 'man', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'work', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'Cold', 'Blood', '2005', 'Capote', 'first', 'began', 'watching', 'Infamous', 'found', 'wondering', 'how', 'could', 'possibly', 'sit', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'film', 'dandyish', 'hopelessly', 'pretentious', 'man', 'smarming', 'way', 'New', 'York', 'high', 'society', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'voice', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'even', 'was', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'bothersome', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'horrible', 'fake', 'Southern', 'accent', 'role', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'film', 'progressed', 'though', 'strange', 'little', 'man', 'began', 'grow', 'mid-way', 'point', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'engrossed', 'story', 'ending', 'clinched', 'five', 'stars', 'have', 'give', 'film', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'given', 'fact', 'three', 'least', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'aforementioned', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', '.Obviously', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'one', 'most', 'complex', 'fascinating', 'men', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'define', 'man', 'interpretation', 'display', 'Infamous', 'based', 'Douglas', 'McGrath', '1997', 'oral', 'biography', 'man', 'fictionalized', 'story', 'man', 'known', 'own', 'obfuscations', 'truth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'purely', 'objective', 'eyes', 'Capote', 'relied', 'memory', 'rather', 'notes', 'produce', 'book', 'what', 'gather', '2005', 'Capote', 'noticeably', 'different', 'perspective', 'man', 'basically', 'same', 'story', 'Infamous', 'focusing', 'writing', 'later', 'publication', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'One', 'thing', 'am', 'sure', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'absolutely', 'captivating', 'performance', 'most', 'inscrutable', 'characters', 'Capote', 'seemed', 'fake', 'early', 'scenes', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'transformed', 'incredibly', 'human', 'soul', 'long', 'end', 'began', 'rolling', 'sympathetic', 'significant', 'degree', 'flaws', 'Capote', 'character', 'manifest', 'not', 'own', 'emotionally', 'cold-blooded', 'moment', 'here', 'there', 'nothing', 'else', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'not', 'man', 'would', 'want', 'confide', 'darkest', 'secrets.Infamous', 'pretty', 'emotionally', 'complicated', 'once', 'Capote', 'finally', 'access', 'killers', 'especially', 'reluctant', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'bumpy', 'ride', 'relationship', 'Smith', 'Capote', 'lynchpin', 'film', 'Infamous', 'dares', 'call', 'love', 'imagine', 'debatable', 'Clearly', 'though', 'two', 'men', 'understood', 'one', 'ways', 'few', 'others', 'ever', 'did', 'drama', 'concluding', 'scenes', 'truly', 'palpable.I', 'find', 'somewhat', 'actual', 'murder', 'gave', 'rise', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'two', 'recent', 'films', 'Truman', 'Capote', ""n't"", 'seem', 'generate', 'much', 'interest', 'Capote', 'myth', 'man', 'towers', 'subject', 'matter', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'know', 'real', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'watching', 'film', ""'m"", 'intrigued', 'enough', 'go', 'seek', 'out', '2005', 'Capote', 'see', 'story', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'told', 'alternate', 'viewpoint']",N/A

Years ago a Broadway show made the rounds called ""Tru,"" which depicted the master as a drunken loser with heart. The recent film ""Capote"" and now ""Infamous"" seek to show the man as a complex figure who wrote a very good book about the famous murders in the mid-west that would have been forgotten had it not been for this strange little genius. The film is well made, although I don't see dramatic differences between the stories, which both show Capote as a writer who was made and destroyed by this singular success. The acting is uniformly splendid. Especially noteworthy is Sandra Bullock, who plays southern extremely well. Juliet Stevenson is great. Weaver is a hoot, especially with that height that shows her towering over Capote. Toby Jones is very good as Capote, in many ways fulfilling the role fully, but Hoffman's performance in the rival film was equally good. Both give performances which convince us of Capote's his inner torment. Here, it seems to me, the part of Perry Smith was better written than in ""Capote."" There is more to him than meets the eye. The performance by Daniel Craig is memorable. Much is made of Perry's sexuality, and one is given the impression that Capote fell for him, which may or may not be true. Who knows?

It is well directed and acted by competent professionals, and is worth your time if you are at all interested in the other respected NY City arts, literature and humor professionals of the 50's era who are introduced. They are presented (what can I say) in less serious moments of their careers. Comments made on camera, out of context, I suppose were taken from their own writings.The main focus of the movie is on a notorious murder committed in Kansas in 1959, but is not a remake of an earlier movie (1967, remade in 1996) with the same title as the book. That movie focused on the crime, the police investigation and the arrest of the criminals, and alleged that the criminals murdered the victims immediately and then spent some time searching for hidden money, of which there was none.By contrast, this movie is a biographical sketch of the author and his own personal investigation of the crime, along with his own attitudes, interests and observations at the crime scene, and finally, his interviews with the killers.I must break here and disclaim any direct knowledge of the characters and events themselves or of the author, director, or actors, or the book, and state that I am only discussing the movie and what the movie states directly or reasonably implies. If the movie misrepresented any of the above, then the offended parties should long ago have made claims against the movie's producers. If you, the reader, enjoyed the movie and had no questions, forget the rest of this review.The above is said because, to say it plainly, the movie is a study in Sadomasochism (consult the dictionary definition).Thus the author's interest (as it appears) is in vicariously experiencing the suffering of the victims; not in the killings themselves, but in details such as the distribution of blood shed (even a single speck), as if the killers were some kind of artists; and in undisturbed minutia of the victims household.  Likewise the author's interest in the killers was not in their plans (they had none) or their motive (nothing was taken). Their motive (as it appears) was only in the tormenting of victims, called sadism.The interviews with the criminals further brings out the absence of repentance, their disregard for their coming execution, and the authors masochistic desire to experience personal contact with and, at the end, physical abuse by the killers.In the final scene the author specifically states that the title ""In Cold Blood"" does not refer to the murders, but to the execution of the criminals.The good people of Kansas were gracious to the author during his stay, treating his life style and affectations as a novelty.PS. The first scene, in which a professional actress flubs a song and breaks down crying, must be some kind of insider detail, known only by New York celebrities.  Forget it.",5,INFAMOUS.

Von Behren ""reneofc""","[5, 7]","While Capote director Bennett Miller constructs a psychological analysis of the outrageous Breakfast at Tiffany's author Truman Capote's Faustian trail leading to the masterful crafting of the first true crime thriller ""In Cold Blood"", in ""Infamous"", director Douglas McGrath explores Capote's motivation on a more personal level.  Both films tell pretty much the same story; both lead actors, Toby Jones in this offering and Philip Seymour Hoffman in ""Capote"" submit first rate performances.  The difference lies in how each director accounts for Capote's ultimate later dysfunction as a writer and ruin as a human being.""Infamous"" is told as a part docudrama where famous personages like Vogue's Diana Vreeland and ""To Kill a Mockingbird's Harper Lee interject their impressions of Capote to the audience while the actual events leading to the creation of ""In Cold Blood"" unfold in a quasi-chronological order.The strength in this version of the ""In Cold Blood"" conception story is in the details.  Daniel Craig depiction of Perry, one of the murderers, blazes with an internal sexual intensity that leaves little to the imagination as to Capote's dilemma with wanting to have the perfect circular ending to his story and not wanting his relationship with this man to end with his execution.  In ""Capote"", actor Hoffman, as the titular lead, speculates that with their similar backgrounds and underpinnings and the absence of his writing as an outlet, he could have become Perry, but in ""Infamous,"" the audience needs not Capote's voice to provide an explanation.  Director McGrath forces us to watch the chemistry between Perry and Capote; we watch Capote deteriorate as he lies and manipulates to get the best story, all the while loosing his own needy soul to another.  ""Infamous"" not only recreates that late 50s - early 60s period of Manhattan splendor, but allows one entry into the conniving yet thoroughly human mindset of one of America's great writers.  McGrath weaves falsehoods with veracity, twisting Capote's intended creation with the brutal yet less dramatic actuality----his execution scene reeks with an unsentimental matter-of-factness as Capote relates to his society friends his manufactured perfect ending while in reality he runs in pain as Perry is hooded and prepared for death.  One of its most poignant and compelling moments occurs when Capote, after Perry's hanging opens up Perry's personal effects and discovers a pencil drawing of himself entitled, ""Friend Truman.""  Capote is depicted as friend, lover and conniving user.Bottom Line?  This version of the ""In Cold Blood"" story is well worth expending the 118 minute playing time.  If you enjoyed Capote and want to re-explore the story from another perspective, check this one out.

1042987,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000M341SC,Ed Uyeshima,"[8, 10]","An unfortunate twist of providence plagued this 2006 film since it was one of two major studio productions covering the same story and completed almost at the same time. The other movie, Bennett Miller's ""Capote"" (2005), was universally acclaimed with Philip Seymour Hoffman's superbly etched performance winning accolade after accolade including last year's Best Actor Oscar. Held back for a year, this version is decidedly more colorful but somewhat more superficial, coming across less as a character-driven study than an unrequited love story between world-famous writer Truman Capote and notorious murderer Perry Smith.Both movies focus on Capote's investigation of the 1959 Kansas murder of the Clutter family and the two young men convicted of the crime, Smith and Richard Hickock. Director/screenwriter Douglas McGrath places greater emphasis on Capote's celebrity-filled social circle in Manhattan by using them as a narrative device to move the story along. The other major difference is how the relationship between Capote and Smith becomes less about the author's singular ambition to get his story than how two disparate men find a common bond in their mutually repressive situation. The author's compassion for Perry contains a deeper sense of longing in McGrath's version, and the feelings are reciprocated with surprising candor by Smith.Yet, the whole venture falls short because the star-studded cast and smart production values cannot compensate for the hollow ring at the core of this film. We are never really privy to Capote's creative genius, nor does his resulting book, ""In Cold Blood"" feel palpable beyond passing references. There is certainly not a lack of effort here, as character actor Toby Jones is far more of a dead ringer for the real Capote than even Hoffman. At the same time, the startling accuracy of Jones' cadence and mannerisms still cannot match Hoffman's pained gravitas in the role. Prior to becoming the current 007, Daniel Craig impressively conveys the tender and terrorizing sides of Smith with equal aplomb. As author Harper Lee, Sandra Bullock submerges herself into the quiet role of a low-key confidante who keeps Capote on his toes. Jeff Daniels effectively plays the taciturn D.A. Alvin Dewey, although the overall portrayal of the star-struck townsfolk feels overly patronizing.The remaining star turns amount to extended cameos and frankly a marginal waste of stellar talent - Sigourney Weaver as Babe Paley, wife of CBS chairman Bill Paley; Hope Davis as Slim Keith, who was married to director Howard Hawks and agent Leland Hayward; Isabella Rossellini as socialite Marella Agnelli; Juliet Stevenson as Vogue editor Diana Vreeland; and in the opening nightclub scene, Gwyneth Paltrow as Peggy Lee (whose name has been changed to `Kitty Dean' in the movie). The late 1950's period look of the film benefits from expert, unobtrusive work from cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel, production designer Judy Becker, and costume designer Ruth Myers. Thanks to the exhaustive research he conducted on his subject, McGrath contributes an informative commentary track on the 2007 DVD, the only extra beyond the original theatrical trailer.",3,The Same Story Told as a Celebrity-Filled Account of Unrequited Love,1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,3185,"['unfortunate', 'twist', 'providence', 'plagued', '2006', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'two', 'major', 'studio', 'productions', 'covering', 'same', 'story', 'completed', 'almost', 'same', 'time', 'other', 'movie', 'Bennett', 'Miller', 'Capote', '2005', 'was', 'universally', 'acclaimed', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'superbly', 'etched', 'performance', 'winning', 'accolade', 'accolade', 'including', 'last', 'year', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'Held', 'back', 'year', 'version', 'decidedly', 'more', 'colorful', 'somewhat', 'more', 'superficial', 'coming', 'across', 'less', 'character-driven', 'study', 'unrequited', 'love', 'story', 'world-famous', 'writer', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'notorious', 'murderer', 'Perry', 'Smith.Both', 'movies', 'focus', 'Capote', 'investigation', '1959', 'Kansas', 'murder', 'Clutter', 'family', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'convicted', 'crime', 'Smith', 'Richard', 'Hickock', 'Director/screenwriter', 'Douglas', 'McGrath', 'places', 'greater', 'emphasis', 'Capote', 'celebrity-filled', 'social', 'circle', 'Manhattan', 'using', 'narrative', 'device', 'move', 'story', 'along', 'other', 'major', 'difference', 'how', 'relationship', 'Capote', 'Smith', 'less', 'author', 'singular', 'ambition', 'get', 'story', 'how', 'two', 'disparate', 'men', 'find', 'common', 'bond', 'mutually', 'repressive', 'situation', 'author', 'compassion', 'Perry', 'deeper', 'sense', 'longing', 'McGrath', 'version', 'feelings', 'are', 'reciprocated', 'surprising', 'candor', 'Smith.Yet', 'whole', 'venture', 'short', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'smart', 'production', 'values', 'can', 'not', 'compensate', 'hollow', 'ring', 'core', 'film', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'privy', 'Capote', 'creative', 'genius', 'resulting', 'book', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'feel', 'palpable', 'passing', 'references', 'certainly', 'not', 'lack', 'effort', 'here', 'character', 'actor', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'far', 'more', 'dead', 'ringer', 'real', 'Capote', 'even', 'Hoffman', 'same', 'time', 'startling', 'accuracy', 'Jones', 'cadence', 'mannerisms', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'match', 'Hoffman', 'pained', 'gravitas', 'role', 'Prior', 'becoming', 'current', '007', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'impressively', 'conveys', 'tender', 'terrorizing', 'sides', 'Smith', 'equal', 'aplomb', 'author', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'quiet', 'role', 'low-key', 'confidante', 'who', 'Capote', 'toes', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'effectively', 'taciturn', 'D.A', 'Alvin', 'Dewey', 'overall', 'portrayal', 'star-struck', 'townsfolk', 'feels', 'overly', 'patronizing.The', 'remaining', 'star', 'amount', 'extended', 'cameos', 'frankly', 'marginal', 'waste', 'stellar', 'talent', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Babe', 'Paley', 'wife', 'CBS', 'chairman', 'Bill', 'Paley', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'Slim', 'Keith', 'who', 'was', 'married', 'director', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'agent', 'Leland', 'Hayward', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'socialite', 'Marella', 'Agnelli', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'Vogue', 'editor', 'Diana', 'Vreeland', 'opening', 'nightclub', 'scene', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Peggy', 'Lee', 'name', 'been', 'changed', 'Kitty', 'Dean', 'movie', 'late', '1950', 'period', 'look', 'film', 'benefits', 'expert', 'unobtrusive', 'work', 'cinematographer', 'Bruno', 'Delbonnel', 'production', 'designer', 'Judy', 'Becker', 'costume', 'designer', 'Ruth', 'Myers', 'Thanks', 'exhaustive', 'research', 'conducted', 'subject', 'McGrath', 'informative', 'commentary', 'track', '2007', 'DVD', 'only', 'extra', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A

While both Toby and Hoffman did a wonderful job on the portrayal, Toby's is just a bit more ""spot on"" for the character, you really do feel like it is Capote.  This film, coming out after CAPOTE, never really garnished the praise it deserved.  First off CAPOTE only has Hoffman and Chris Cooper who have any box office notoriety. INFAMOUS has Bullock, Weaver, Rossalini, Craig, Daniels even Paltrow and all perform their respective rolls with utter believability.  The film does not take itself too seriously, and breaks the morbidity of the subject matter with some humor and even glorious early 60s NYC society scenes.  It makes for a great contrast between that and the stark dark world of Kansas and the tragedy which has unfolded. Even some of the ""non factual"" scenes add cadence to the story and make draws you in much more than CAPOTE, which I felt was too biopic and at times way too boring.

1042991,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000M341SC,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","INFAMOUS is a brilliant adaptation by writer/director Douglas McGrath of the 'infamous' George Plimpton book 'Truman Capote: In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career'.  What McGrath has gleaned from this resource book is a story that better than any other lets us understand the bizarre personality of Truman Capote (an extraordinary performance by Toby Jones whose films have included The Painted Veil, Elizabeth I, Mrs. Henderson Presents, Finding Neverland, Ladies in Lavender, etc), from his early successes as a writer ('Breakfast at Tiffany's') through his countless acquaintances with the glitterati of the world to his ultimate obsession with the Kansas Clutter family murders that served as the matrix for his final volume 'In Cold Blood' and the demise of his career and life.McGrath understands Capote's aura and lets us watch it in the early on camera 'interviews' with important people who knew him.  We meet Babe Paley (Sigourney Weaver),  Diana Vreeland (Juliet Stevenson), Gore Vidal (Michael Panes), Slim Keith (Hope Davis), Bennett Cerf (Peter Bogdanovich), Marella Agnelli (Isabella Rossellini), and his longtime partner Jack (John Benjamin Hickey).  Each gives us a vignette of a side of Capote's genius and caricature of genius, but it is not until Capote and Babe sit in a nightclub hearing songstress Kitty Dean (Gweneth Paltrow in a small but surely one of her very finest roles) sing and breakdown in her version of 'What is this thing called love?' that the story itself begins.  From that point on McGrath has a firm handle on the story we all know well.The Clutter family murder in Kansas in 1959 as a small article in the newspaper captures Capote's eye and imagination: he decides to write an article on the response of the citizens of a small town to the heinous act.  He talks his close friend, novelist Nelle Harper Lee (Sandra Bullock) whose novel 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is all the rage but she is now in writer's block, to accompany him to Kansas to interview the townspeople.  Capote's flamboyant appearance and demeanor and voice are off putting to the townsfolk until Capote and Lee break a barrier with the sheriff (Jeff Daniels) and his wife and become a sought after dinner guest pair.  Then the killers are captured: Dick Hickock (Lee Pace) and Perry Smith (Daniel Craig in one his finest cinematic roles to date), and the flavor of Capote's concept changes dramatically.Gradually Capote gains access to speaking with the two killers and decides his intended 'article' has become a book. His interviews with both Hickock and Perry feed his imagination and flurry, but it is his bonding with Perry that opens the gates of mutual self confession and shared understanding of not dissimilar backgrounds: Capote and Perry fall in love.  Once the trial is over and the two killers are condemned to hang, Capote returns to Kansas as the victims' invited presence at their hanging: much of what Capote needs to finish his book is dependent on their death and he longs for Perry to ask the world's forgiveness as the pinnacle for his book.Capote's book is published and becomes an international best seller, but Capote sinks into alcohol, drugs and oblivion until his death.  We are spared all this by McGrath's once again allowing the interviewees to speak, especially the damaged and tender Nelle Harper Lee.  And the film evaporates into myth.Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel keenly photographs this inordinately strong cast as well as is the vast landscape of Kansas.  Rachel Portman provides her most original and successful musical score to date to conjure the moodiness of the tale. Toby Jones is magnificent as Truman Capote, delivering the kind of career making performance that comes along only rarely.  This is an intelligent script, well directed, and splendidly executed and deserves at least as much attention as the much lauded CAPOTE that probably prevented the success of INFAMOUS in the theaters.

1042992,AAIL33CYCT47J,B000M341SC,Gregory Baird,"[136, 140]","In an incredible bit of misfortune, 'Infamous' will have to live with the stigma of being 'that other movie' about Truman Capote writing his masterpiece 'In Cold Blood'.  Over time that distinction may begin to wear off, but only time will tell.  The trouble with this situation is that it is impossible to see 2006's 'Infamous' without comparing it to 2005's 'Capote' -- even if you try.  I promised myself that I would attempt to watch it with a fresh perspective, but within ten minutes I had decidedly broken that promise and started a list of differences and similarities in my mind.  What is so unfair about this is that while 'Capote' is a very good movie, 'Infamous' is just a good one, making its faults stand out that much more by comparing it to its predecessor.  Never before has being good not been good enough.Purists undoubtedly take to 'Capote' as the superior film and lambaste 'Infamous' as a pretender to the throne, but what they are missing out on are the intriguing differences in perspective that the two films have.  It is here that 'Infamous' earns its merits, but also where its defining flaw comes into play: that it is too afraid to risk making Truman an unsympathetic character.  'Capote' gets at the heart of the deviousness inherent in Truman's dealings with Perry Smith and Dick Hickock (the killers on death row whose stories, along with those of their victims, comprise 'In Cold Blood') -- how he used and abused their friendship and trust in order to write his masterpiece.  Philip Seymour Hoffman's Truman Capote is an egotistical liar that sells his soul for his story, made sympathetic by Hoffman's careful portrayal and by the fact that his cruelty causes him to spiral into drink, depression, and ruin for the rest of his life.  The makers of 'Infamous' shy away from this aspect of Capote, choosing to go for sympathy instead.  His deceit is only mentioned in passing -- with the effect that you wouldn't notice it if you weren't looking for it.  This Truman really cares for Perry Smith, and the film posits that what ruined him after the executions was the loss of the one person he had ever truly connected with.  This Truman is a victim of his book's conclusion rather than culpable in it.  It's an interesting theory, but it holds less weight and feels toothless.  I don't know enough about the facts to speculate as to whether or not the sexual tension that develops between the writer and the convict is accurate, but it does add an element of intrigue to the story.The relationship between Truman and Perry in 'Infamous' adds a layer to the characterization of the author that was missing from 'Capote': that he was really a damaged, insecure man at heart, and had been ever since his childhood.  The bravado, the confidance, the wit, and the eloquence that Manhattan's high society adore him for is a mask that he has put on to hide how he really feels about himself.  His entire personality is an affectation, and his carefully maintained social life is artifice.  Other reviewers have criticized 'Infamous' for being too stylized, but I think that they were trying to show how fake his life in New York was -- and in my humble opinion they succeeded.  Toby Jones' portrayal is, as such, less natural than Hoffman's, but is perfectly suited to this intention of the filmmakers and succeeds in its own right.  Had 'Infamous' come before 'Capote' Jones may have been more recognized for his work with an Oscar nomination of his own, but as I said earlier, timing has not been kind to 'Infamous'.  Anyway, Truman and Perry make a connection because they can be who they really are around each other: Perry can talk about his lonely, abusive childhood and desire to be an artist, while Truman can let his guard down and stop acting like a ""wind-up doll"" (to use a term from the movie).

1042993,ANIMV3SPDD8SH,B000M341SC,Guy De Federicis,"[4, 6]","The 'other' Truman Capote bio film, which came on the heels of the successful Oscar winning ""Capote"", also examines Capote's non-fiction writing of the slaughter of the Cutter family, and his relationship with the killers. Toby Jones, as Capote is more extravagant, more expressive and feminine than Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance, and there lies here a greater vulnerablity, a weakling inside a wolf's coat, a Capote whose insecurities are clearly evident beneath an exterior manner of confidence and vanity. When he is attacked by one of the killers, (Daniel Craig), in a jail cell, he cowers like a frightened child, when he reveals his own childhood traumas, in comparison with the killer's, all masks and manipulative attitude disappears, as if revealing a real person, without pretension for the first time. I don't know why there was a sudden interest in Capote writing In Cold Blood, the groundbreaking true crime book of 1966, but both movies, while attempting to present a character study of Capote, are overshadowed by the sensational and brutal murder of the Cutter family. It's difficult to access Capote's psychological struggle while the hunt for the killers carries on off-screen, as Capote and his New York literary friends sip wine and chat with the enamored townspeople, who after a silence campaign, accept Capote as an eccentric oddity they enjoy rubbing elbows with. I liked the nostalgic New York cocktail party scene, with literary art types learning how to do Chubby Checker's The Twist. It is another world compared with the bleak empty Kansas farmland where the murder occurs. The dialogue with the killers seemed at times, to be coy and unconvincing, as they find reason to put trust in the New York writer in a feminine fur coat, with the nasal muted voice described here as ""if a brussels sprout could talk"". It takes only a few manipulative and pat tricks from Capote to gain their trust, one being his familiarity with Marlon Brando. The two Capote movies are surprisingly alike, covering similiar ground, making sly mention of Capote ally Harper Lee's next novel after To Kill A Mockingbird, which was, and is still, unfullfilled, but both films accept the sad murder of the family as merely a  sub-plot to reveal Capote as a troubled man, and neither films compare to the original writing and the 1967 film by Richard Brooks, which too reveal the writer as deeply affected by his relationship with the doomed killers.",3,THE OTHER CAPOTE,1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,2470,"[""'other"", 'Truman', 'Capote', 'bio', 'film', 'came', 'heels', 'successful', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Capote', 'also', 'Capote', 'non-fiction', 'writing', 'slaughter', 'Cutter', 'family', 'relationship', 'killers', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Capote', 'more', 'extravagant', 'more', 'expressive', 'feminine', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'performance', 'there', 'here', 'greater', 'vulnerablity', 'weakling', 'wolf', 'coat', 'Capote', 'insecurities', 'are', 'clearly', 'evident', 'exterior', 'manner', 'confidence', 'vanity', 'When', 'attacked', 'one', 'killers', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'jail', 'cell', 'frightened', 'child', 'when', 'own', 'childhood', 'traumas', 'comparison', 'killer', 'masks', 'manipulative', 'attitude', 'disappears', 'revealing', 'real', 'person', 'pretension', 'first', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'was', 'sudden', 'interest', 'Capote', 'writing', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'groundbreaking', 'true', 'crime', 'book', '1966', 'movies', 'attempting', 'present', 'character', 'study', 'Capote', 'are', 'overshadowed', 'sensational', 'brutal', 'murder', 'Cutter', 'family', 'difficult', 'access', 'Capote', 'psychological', 'struggle', 'hunt', 'killers', 'off-screen', 'Capote', 'New', 'York', 'literary', 'friends', 'sip', 'wine', 'chat', 'enamored', 'townspeople', 'who', 'silence', 'campaign', 'accept', 'Capote', 'eccentric', 'oddity', 'enjoy', 'rubbing', 'elbows', 'liked', 'nostalgic', 'New', 'York', 'cocktail', 'party', 'scene', 'literary', 'art', 'types', 'learning', 'how', 'do', 'Chubby', 'Checker', 'Twist', 'world', 'compared', 'bleak', 'empty', 'Kansas', 'farmland', 'where', 'murder', 'dialogue', 'killers', 'seemed', 'times', 'be', 'coy', 'unconvincing', 'find', 'reason', 'put', 'trust', 'New', 'York', 'writer', 'feminine', 'fur', 'coat', 'nasal', 'muted', 'voice', 'described', 'here', 'brussels', 'sprout', 'could', 'talk', 'only', 'few', 'manipulative', 'pat', 'tricks', 'Capote', 'gain', 'trust', 'one', 'being', 'familiarity', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'two', 'Capote', 'movies', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'alike', 'covering', 'similiar', 'ground', 'making', 'sly', 'mention', 'Capote', 'ally', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'next', 'novel', 'Kill', 'A', 'Mockingbird', 'was', 'still', 'unfullfilled', 'films', 'accept', 'sad', 'murder', 'family', 'merely', 'sub-plot', 'reveal', 'Capote', 'troubled', 'man', 'films', 'compare', 'original', 'writing', '1967', 'film', 'Richard', 'Brooks', 'too', 'reveal', 'writer', 'deeply', 'affected', 'relationship', 'doomed', 'killers']",N/A
1042994,A9I40WFF40R4,B000M341SC,"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[1, 1]","""Infamous"" has a little bit of the same problem that the film ""The Wizard of Oz"" had in that it was released in 1939, the same year as ""Gone With The Wind,"" which of course took the award for best picture that year. This really good film will always be compared, perhaps unfairly, with ""Capote,"" for which Philip Semour Hoffman won the Oscar for best actor. The British actor Toby Jones is just as believable as Hoffman as the elfin author of such American classics as BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S and of course IN COLD BLOOD, the research and writing of which is the time in Capote's life that both films cover. Jones certainly has both the stature of the writer, actually looks more like Capote than Hoffman does and has the voice and accent just right.Based on George Plimpton's oral history of Truman Capote, the film opens with Gwyneth Paltrow singing ""What Is This Thing Called Love?"" and moves back and forth between scenes in New York-- with usually either Capote meeting and gossiping with his high society friends, Diana Vreeland (Juliet Stevenson), Babe Paley (Sigourney Weaver), Bennett Cerf (Peter Bogdanovich), et al or these people speaking directly to the audience as they did in the book-- and Kansas where the entire Clutter family was murdered. Sandra Bullock is cast as Harper Lee, the author of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and Capote's friend from childhood. Daniel Craig as Perry Smith, who plays one of the killers who was eventually executed for the murders, is sexy, complicated and vulnerable. While we do not excuse him for the horrific thing he has done, when we see the awful childhood he had, we can understand, at least in part, what may have got him to Kansas on that fateful night. While we will never know if Smith's and Capote's relationship was as intimate as this film indicates, it does seem certain that the writer's life was never the same after he wrote IN COLD BLOOD and that he spiralled downward and never wrote much of anything else of consequence thereafter.As I recall, Jones plays Capote as a much more tragic and sympathetic person than Hoffman did. In ""Capote"" the writer comes across as much more cynical than in ""Infamous"" in that he really did not want the murderers to win their appeals since their executions would make his book better.If you liked ""Capote,"" you certainly should see ""Infamous.""",5,Another Excellent Portrayal of Truman Capote,1233446400,"02 1, 2009",2009,2338,"['Infamous', 'little', 'bit', 'same', 'problem', 'film', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'had', 'was', 'released', '1939', 'same', 'year', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'course', 'took', 'award', 'best', 'picture', 'year', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'compared', 'perhaps', 'unfairly', 'Capote', 'Philip', 'Semour', 'Hoffman', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'actor', 'British', 'actor', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'just', 'as', 'believable', 'Hoffman', 'elfin', 'author', 'such', 'American', 'classics', 'BREAKFAST', 'AT', 'TIFFANY', 'course', 'IN', 'COLD', 'BLOOD', 'research', 'writing', 'time', 'Capote', 'life', 'films', 'cover', 'Jones', 'certainly', 'stature', 'writer', 'actually', 'more', 'Capote', 'Hoffman', 'voice', 'accent', 'just', 'right.Based', 'George', 'Plimpton', 'oral', 'history', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'film', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'singing', 'What', 'Thing', 'Called', 'Love', 'back', 'forth', 'scenes', 'New', 'York', 'usually', 'Capote', 'meeting', 'gossiping', 'high', 'society', 'friends', 'Diana', 'Vreeland', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'Babe', 'Paley', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Bennett', 'Cerf', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'et', 'al', 'people', 'speaking', 'directly', 'audience', 'did', 'book', 'Kansas', 'where', 'entire', 'Clutter', 'family', 'was', 'murdered', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'cast', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'author', 'TO', 'KILL', 'A', 'MOCKINGBIRD', 'Capote', 'friend', 'childhood', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'who', 'one', 'killers', 'who', 'was', 'eventually', 'executed', 'murders', 'sexy', 'complicated', 'vulnerable', 'do', 'not', 'excuse', 'horrific', 'thing', 'done', 'when', 'see', 'awful', 'childhood', 'had', 'can', 'understand', 'least', 'part', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'got', 'Kansas', 'fateful', 'night', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'Smith', 'Capote', 'relationship', 'was', 'as', 'intimate', 'film', 'seem', 'certain', 'writer', 'life', 'was', 'never', 'same', 'wrote', 'IN', 'COLD', 'BLOOD', 'spiralled', 'downward', 'never', 'wrote', 'much', 'anything', 'else', 'consequence', 'thereafter.As', 'recall', 'Jones', 'Capote', 'much', 'more', 'tragic', 'sympathetic', 'person', 'Hoffman', 'did', 'Capote', 'writer', 'as', 'much', 'more', 'cynical', 'Infamous', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'murderers', 'win', 'appeals', 'executions', 'would', 'make', 'book', 'better.If', 'liked', 'Capote', 'certainly', 'should', 'see', 'Infamous']",N/A
1042995,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B000M341SC,Hikari,"[2, 2]","""Infamous"" will forever after be compared (unfavorably by most) to its immediate predecessor, ""Capote"".  Without dissing the earlier movie, or Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar-winning perfomance, and having seen both, in the same weekend, I much prefer this one.  ""Capote"" may be the more ""important"" film, if self-consciousness & a complete lack of humor are virtues.  I feel quite certain that Toby Jones will not get a call from Oscar for this role.  The Academy prefers to pass out statues for acting only when heavy lifting is involved, and evident to all watching. Mr. Jones is a dead-ringer for Capote in build and coloring, and so effortlessly does he inhabit the diminutive shoes of the writer, you forget that this is an actor playing a role, and that you aren't actually being regaled by Truman himself.  You could never say the same for Hoffman, who wisely opted for restraint in his portrayal, given that he is twice the real Capote's size.  Not so Jones, who pulls out all the stops in giving us Capote's outrageous dress & flamboyant manner in a way that Capote's contemporaries might have viewed him.  And he gets away with it.  What might have appeared cruel camp on a larger man rests easily on Jones' narrow shoulders.  Whereas ""Capote"" is more effective at giving us the interior deterioration of Capote, ""Infamous"" is superior at painting the complicated and agonized relationship between the writer and Perry Smith, aided by an outstanding performance by Daniel Craig as Smith.  Both films are outstanding in their production design, but unlike ""Capote""'s elegiac, almost Homer-like landscapes, ""Infamous"" excels at giving us the Technicolor glitz of the late '50s, and making us feel that sense of (often cheesy) place, accompanied by some great Rat-Pack style tunes.  And the film is redolent with humor, usually tied to Truman's penchant for women's outerwear and the flustered locals of Holcomb addressing him as 'ma'am'.  This film gives us more of sense of how much joie de vivre Capote had, and how much fun he could be until things went off the rails.  It is not the complete story by any means, but it gives us Truman as others saw him.  The Hoffman version gave us Truman as he perhaps saw himself.  This is an affectionate portrayal of a character who will never be duplicated, but Toby Jones comes as close, perhaps, as another guy can get.  I think both versions can be enjoyed on their own merits, but whether you adored ""Capote"" or were nonplussed with it, ""Infamous"" deserves a look.",4,Like Bubbles in a Glass of Champagne,1177372800,"04 24, 2007",2007,2519,"['Infamous', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'compared', 'unfavorably', 'most', 'immediate', 'predecessor', 'Capote', 'dissing', 'earlier', 'movie', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Oscar-winning', 'perfomance', 'having', 'seen', 'same', 'weekend', 'much', 'prefer', 'one', 'Capote', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'important', 'film', 'self-consciousness', 'complete', 'lack', 'humor', 'are', 'virtues', 'feel', 'quite', 'certain', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'call', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Academy', 'prefers', 'pass', 'out', 'statues', 'acting', 'only', 'when', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'involved', 'evident', 'watching', 'Mr.', 'Jones', 'dead-ringer', 'Capote', 'build', 'coloring', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'inhabit', 'diminutive', 'shoes', 'writer', 'forget', 'actor', 'playing', 'role', 'are', ""n't"", 'actually', 'being', 'regaled', 'Truman', 'could', 'never', 'say', 'same', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'wisely', 'opted', 'restraint', 'portrayal', 'given', 'twice', 'real', 'Capote', 'size', 'Not', 'so', 'Jones', 'who', 'out', 'stops', 'giving', 'Capote', 'outrageous', 'dress', 'flamboyant', 'manner', 'way', 'Capote', 'contemporaries', 'might', 'have', 'viewed', 'away', 'What', 'might', 'have', 'appeared', 'cruel', 'camp', 'larger', 'man', 'easily', 'Jones', 'narrow', 'shoulders', 'Capote', 'more', 'effective', 'giving', 'interior', 'deterioration', 'Capote', 'Infamous', 'superior', 'painting', 'complicated', 'agonized', 'relationship', 'writer', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'aided', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Smith', 'films', 'are', 'outstanding', 'production', 'design', 'Capote', 'elegiac', 'almost', 'Homer-like', 'landscapes', 'Infamous', 'excels', 'giving', 'Technicolor', 'glitz', 'late', ""'50s"", 'making', 'feel', 'sense', 'often', 'cheesy', 'place', 'accompanied', 'great', 'Rat-Pack', 'style', 'tunes', 'film', 'redolent', 'humor', 'usually', 'tied', 'Truman', 'penchant', 'women', 'outerwear', 'flustered', 'locals', 'Holcomb', 'addressing', ""'ma'am"", 'film', 'more', 'sense', 'how', 'much', 'joie', 'vivre', 'Capote', 'had', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'could', 'be', 'things', 'went', 'rails', 'not', 'complete', 'story', 'means', 'Truman', 'others', 'saw', 'Hoffman', 'version', 'gave', 'Truman', 'perhaps', 'saw', 'affectionate', 'portrayal', 'character', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'duplicated', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'as', 'close', 'perhaps', 'guy', 'can', 'get', 'think', 'versions', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'own', 'merits', 'adored', 'Capote', 'were', 'nonplussed', 'Infamous', 'look']",N/A

1043001,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B000M341SC,Jason Bean,"[2, 2]","Two films about Truman Capote and his novel 'In Cold Blood' were made in 2005: The oscar winning 'Capote'  and this little known 'Infamous'. I read that surprisingly both films were being made at the same time but neither studio was aware of the other's project. While both films very much tell the same story, their tone and technique are different enough I can still recommend seeing 'Infamous' even if you've already seen 'Capote'.'Infamous' follows Truman Capote (Toby Jones), the flamboyant New York City novelist as he travels to Holcomb, Kansas with his friend Harper Lee (a suprisingly effective Sandra Bullock) and covers the murder of a family and the subsequent investigation and prosecution of the killers. Like in 'Capote' we see how the murder case turns into Truman Capote's more celebrated novel 'In Cold Blood' and the relationship he ends up forming with Perry Smith (a terrific Daniel Craig). While the events play out pretty much like they do in 'Capote', 'Infamous' embellishes the events (particularly the romance between Capote has with Smith) to make it a much more personal and accessible story. While it lacks the authentic, minimalist approach of 'Capote' I found 'Infamous' to be a lot more energitic and entertaining.The roles in 'Infamous' are also filled with more familiar names than 'Capote' was but they add to the more colorful nature of the script. Toby Jones plays Truman as a lively socialite who seems to approach everything with witty banter. Jeff Daniels plays detective Alvin Dewey as a likeable family man and Daniel Craig plays Perry Smith as an introverted but passionate tough guy.It's hard to make a call as to which Truman Capote story is better. Most film buffs, and probably myself would agree that 'Capote's' more matter-of-fact, authentic-feeling movie is the superior one. However I still enjoyed watching 'Infamous' and it's a great film in it's own way.",4,Sensationalized but very entertaining....,1278201600,"07 4, 2010",2010,1908,"['Two', 'films', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'novel', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'were', 'made', '2005', 'oscar', 'winning', 'little', 'known', ""'Infamous"", 'read', 'surprisingly', 'films', 'were', 'being', 'made', 'same', 'time', 'studio', 'was', 'aware', 'other', 'project', 'films', 'very', 'much', 'tell', 'same', 'story', 'tone', 'technique', 'are', 'different', 'enough', 'can', 'still', 'recommend', 'seeing', ""'Infamous"", 'even', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', ""'Capote"", ""'Infamous"", 'Truman', 'Capote', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'flamboyant', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'novelist', 'Holcomb', 'Kansas', 'friend', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'suprisingly', 'effective', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'murder', 'family', 'subsequent', 'investigation', 'prosecution', 'killers', ""'Capote"", 'see', 'how', 'murder', 'case', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'more', 'celebrated', 'novel', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'relationship', 'up', 'forming', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'terrific', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'events', 'play', 'out', 'pretty', 'much', 'do', ""'Capote"", ""'Infamous"", 'embellishes', 'events', 'particularly', 'romance', 'Capote', 'Smith', 'make', 'much', 'more', 'personal', 'accessible', 'story', 'authentic', 'minimalist', 'approach', ""'Capote"", 'found', ""'Infamous"", 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'energitic', 'entertaining.The', 'roles', ""'Infamous"", 'are', 'also', 'filled', 'more', 'familiar', 'names', ""'Capote"", 'was', 'add', 'more', 'colorful', 'nature', 'script', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Truman', 'lively', 'socialite', 'who', 'approach', 'everything', 'witty', 'banter', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'detective', 'Alvin', 'Dewey', 'likeable', 'family', 'man', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'introverted', 'passionate', 'tough', 'guy.It', 'hard', 'make', 'call', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'story', 'better', 'Most', 'film', 'buffs', 'probably', 'would', 'agree', 'more', 'matter-of-fact', 'authentic-feeling', 'movie', 'superior', 'one', 'However', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'watching', ""'Infamous"", 'great', 'film', 'own', 'way']",N/A
1043002,A106016KSI0YQ,B000M341SC,Jay Dickson,"[1, 1]","One of the key moments in this filmed account of the researching and writing of Truman Capote's IN COLD BLOOD occurs when Capote (Toby Jones) sends copies of his previous books to Leavenworth for the benefit of one of his great nonfiction novel's subjects, Perry Smith (Daniel Craig), one of the murderers of the rural Kansas Clutter family. Smith writes back to Capote that the books ""lack kindness"" in their treatment of their characters; though Capote is bewildered by such criticism from ""a four-time killer,"" we are later told by his great friend, Harper Lee (Sandra Bullock), that when Capote drafted IN COLD BLOOD he included kindness in to the text this time. The achievement of Douglas McGrath's 2006 INFAMOUS is its restoration of kindness to the story of how Capote both made his fortune and ruined his emotional health through the writing of IN COLD BLOOD, a subject that the much more critically lauded film from the year before, Bennett Miller's CAPOTE, treated much more coldly: in that other film, Philip Seymour Hoffman played Capote almost as a sociopath, willfully blinding himself to the cruelties he inflicted upon those around him. Toby Jones, who actually looks more like Capote than Hoffman does, emphasizes the writer's sweetness: though he first appears in Holcomb, Kansas like some sort of exotic animal, he gradually wins the townspeople's confidences by his amusing worldliness and great charm. This film also humanizes Capote more fully by depicting his emotional investment in his ""swans,"" Capote's famous, elegant society friends he courted throughout most of his adult life: perhaps the stunt casting of several well-known actresses (Sigourney Weaver, Isabella Rossellini, Hope Davis and Juliet Stevenson) hurt the film's reputation, although hey are fun to see, and Weaver (in particular) does a fine job as the sweet and trusting beauty Babe Paley.Although McGrath gets so much right with this film, he missteps in the film's treatment of Perry Smith. Daniel Craig, who works extremely hard in his miscast role, is just too tall and hunky to be a believable Perry Smith; and when McGrath postulates both Smith's violent attack on Capote in his cell (when he believes Capote has sold him out) and a love scene between the two men, he may be following in Capote's footsteps by mixing fact with fiction, but he makes the tone of the film go all wrong. There's also a misconceived attempt to have Capote's associates offer commentary on the story seemingly after the events and Capote's death in 1984 (though the commentators do not appear to have aged, and Babe Paley's presence among them makes no sense whatsoever given her death in 1978). It does allow for some nice moments for Sandra Bullock, who does her best character work in years as the patient and forgiving Harper Lee.",4,Truth and fiction,1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,2812,"['One', 'key', 'moments', 'filmed', 'account', 'researching', 'writing', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'IN', 'COLD', 'BLOOD', 'when', 'Capote', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'copies', 'previous', 'books', 'Leavenworth', 'benefit', 'one', 'great', 'nonfiction', 'novel', 'subjects', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'one', 'murderers', 'rural', 'Kansas', 'Clutter', 'family', 'Smith', 'back', 'Capote', 'books', 'lack', 'kindness', 'treatment', 'characters', 'Capote', 'bewildered', 'such', 'criticism', 'four-time', 'killer', 'are', 'later', 'told', 'great', 'friend', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'when', 'Capote', 'drafted', 'IN', 'COLD', 'BLOOD', 'included', 'kindness', 'text', 'time', 'achievement', 'Douglas', 'McGrath', '2006', 'INFAMOUS', 'restoration', 'kindness', 'story', 'how', 'Capote', 'made', 'fortune', 'ruined', 'emotional', 'health', 'writing', 'IN', 'COLD', 'BLOOD', 'subject', 'much', 'more', 'critically', 'lauded', 'film', 'year', 'Bennett', 'Miller', 'CAPOTE', 'treated', 'much', 'more', 'coldly', 'other', 'film', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'played', 'Capote', 'almost', 'sociopath', 'willfully', 'blinding', 'cruelties', 'inflicted', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'who', 'actually', 'more', 'Capote', 'Hoffman', 'emphasizes', 'writer', 'sweetness', 'first', 'Holcomb', 'Kansas', 'sort', 'exotic', 'animal', 'gradually', 'townspeople', 'confidences', 'amusing', 'worldliness', 'great', 'charm', 'film', 'also', 'Capote', 'more', 'fully', 'depicting', 'emotional', 'investment', 'swans', 'Capote', 'famous', 'elegant', 'society', 'friends', 'courted', 'most', 'adult', 'life', 'perhaps', 'stunt', 'casting', 'several', 'well-known', 'actresses', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'hurt', 'film', 'reputation', 'hey', 'are', 'fun', 'see', 'Weaver', 'particular', 'fine', 'job', 'sweet', 'trusting', 'beauty', 'Babe', 'Paley.Although', 'McGrath', 'so', 'much', 'right', 'film', 'film', 'treatment', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'who', 'extremely', 'hard', 'miscast', 'role', 'just', 'too', 'tall', 'hunky', 'be', 'believable', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'when', 'McGrath', 'Smith', 'violent', 'attack', 'Capote', 'cell', 'when', 'Capote', 'sold', 'out', 'love', 'scene', 'two', 'men', 'may', 'be', 'following', 'Capote', 'footsteps', 'mixing', 'fact', 'fiction', 'tone', 'film', 'go', 'wrong', 'also', 'misconceived', 'attempt', 'have', 'Capote', 'associates', 'offer', 'commentary', 'story', 'seemingly', 'events', 'Capote', 'death', '1984', 'commentators', 'do', 'not', 'appear', 'have', 'aged', 'Babe', 'Paley', 'presence', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'given', 'death', '1978', 'allow', 'nice', 'moments', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'who', 'best', 'character', 'work', 'years', 'patient', 'forgiving', 'Harper', 'Lee']",N/A

Infamous depicts Capote with all his simpering ways and gossiping airs, but also reveals his basic insecurity and how he struggled to achieve relevance and meaningful relationships. The oddly symbiotic relationship that evolved between Capote and the killer, Perry Smith, is at times heartwarming and at other times almost painful and embarrassing to watch.I couldn't picture Sandra Bullock as Harper Lee initially, but she also grew to inhabit the role of the straight-talking, plain-looking and pragmatic author - before she became famous for her singular work - To Kill a Mockingbird. She was just a friend and accomplice to Capote, occasionally setting him straight when he seemed to be veering too far off course with his quest to find the human story in the Kansas killings. They are the ultimate ""odd couple"", but each scene in which they both appear is lively and interesting and compelling.Daniel Craig as Perry Smith was almost unrecognizable. At first, I wasn't certain it was him because of his darkened hair and eyebrows and brown contact lenses which obscured his bright blue eyes. His raw animal strength and magnetism simply stole every scene in which he appears. It's easy to see why Capote was sucked up into his energy field and fell for him. Who knows whether he really resembled the real-life Perry, but the character he portrayed was complex and compelling.The film sets veer from stark gray scenes in the prison to the sumptuous dining rooms of the New York City social scene inhabited by Capote. The re-enactment at the Kansas farmhouse where the Clutter family was murdered is unflinchingly gruesome. This is first rate entertainment, and has inspired me to re-watch ""Capote"" and re-read ""In Cold Blood"".

The cast is outstanding, with cameo appearances by Gwyneth Paltrow, Isabella Rossellini (as a comical, dimwit Maria Agnelli), and Sigourney Weaver, among others. Toby Jones gives a strong performance as Capote, but it's difficult to live up to Philip Seymour Hoffman's magnificent portrayal. The real star here is the tough, smart, vulnerable Daniel Craig as Perry Smith, the murderer who becomes the only person before whom Capote will allow himself to be vulnerable, while he writes the masterpiece ""In Cold Blood.""In Cold BloodCapote is treated much more sympathetically here than in the other film, as we learn of his terrible childhood. As an adult, his deviousness is more subtle, but still damaging. We see him acting as confidante to his socialite friends, only to spread the scandals all over New York as soon as he leaves the restaurant. And as he becomes more and more attached to Perry, he still must act uninvolved and uncaring when discussing the case with friends. His behavior towards Perry is the mystery in this story--the idea of Perry's execution leaves him weak with grief, but at the same time he frets to his friends about how his book can't be released until there's an ""end"" to the story. He romanticizes and sensationalizes Perry's death, pretending that he witnessed the whole thing even though the film shows him running away before the last moment. There's palpable sexual tension between Perry and Truman in this film, which may or may not be true but certainly brings an added dimension to the story.I saw this film recently, probably two years after I saw ""Capote,"" and that's plenty of time to come to it with fresh eyes.

Rooney,"[2, 2]","Comparing ""Infamous"" (2006) with ""Capote,"" both deal with similar periods in the life of Truman Capote--his research into his famous non-fiction novel ""In Cold Blood."" The brutal murders of the four members of the Clutter family by Perry Smith and Dick Hickock drew Capote into a five year ordeal. In ""Infamous"" he got emotionally too close to one of the killers, Perry Smith.""Infamous"" is more sensational, more salacious, more campy, and I think less well-done than ""Capote."" Everything in ""Infamous"" is done in broad brush strokes and relies in the early portions more on caricature than characterization. Capote was an easy target for mimicry, and both Jones and Philip Seymour Hoffman occasionally crossed the line.Capote is portrayed as selfish, self-absorbed, a malicious gossip, a liar, and a person with a frivolous, high-flying Manhattan lifestyle. He is shown rumor-mongering with his society women chums and doesn't mind sharing with them the gory details of the murders.The outlandish outfits he is wearing when he arrives in Kansas are more a costumer's fantasies than the real thing. Much is made of Truman's flitty behavior.Daniel Craig is a good actor, but not as good as Robert Blake or Clifton Collin, Jr. because he's too assertive and self-possessed for the part of Perry.Truman wins over the townspeople by his gossipy tales about Hollywood celebrities. Jeff Daniels as the investigator has a smaller part to play as the movie progresses. Truman's skill as an arm wrestler seems phony as does the eye contact exchange between Perry and Truman when Perry is being brought back to the county jail for the first time after his capture.Occasionally characters talk to the camera: Truman's friend Nelle Lee Harper author of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and Jack Dunphy, his lover.Truman tells how he's going to break ground with a new kind of reportage, applying fictional techniques to a non-fiction book.One difference from ""Capote"" is in this movie Truman offers Dick and Perry a share of his royalties.He entertains and manipulates Perry and wins him over, but also lies to him. A key confrontation comes when Perry finds out the title of the book is ""In Cold Blood,"" and if we are to believe this account, Perry, in a rage in his cell tried to sexually molest Truman.

Capote is played by Toby Jones. The same role in the previous film version earned an Academy Award for actor Philip Seymour Hoffman.In his review in the New York Times, A.O. Scott called the film ""well worth your attention. It is quick-witted, stylish and well acted... warmer and more tender, if also a bit thinner and showier, than Capote... it is in the end more touching than troubling.""Rex Reed of The New York Observer opined, ""They gave the Oscar to the wrong Truman Capote. I do not begrudge the versatile, popular Philip Seymour Hoffman his Oscar for playing the tiny terror in Capote, but he was doing an impression. In Infamous . . . a diminutive actor with a titanic talent named Toby Jones literally becomes the man himself. This is no lisping impersonation learned from watching old Johnny Carson shows: Mr. Jones moves into Truman's skin, heart and brains. Infamous shows you the man's soul. It is a monumental achievement of great artistry and depth. In some ways, the movie is better, too . . . [it] is infinitely fascinating, cinematically breathtaking and largely impeccable.

It is 1959 and Truman has already displayed an extraordinary literary talent; Harper Lee'sTo Kill a Mockingbird (Harper Perennial Modern Classics)is about to bring her success as well.Thus begins this movie, which, like the previous one,Capote, focuses on Truman's attempts to ingratiate himself enough with the townspeople to earn admittance into their thoughts and feelings.In the process, Truman Capote becomes so involved with one of the killers, Perry Smith (Daniel Craig), that he almost becomes part of the story.At the end, after the hangings and after the book has exceeded every expectation, it's almost as though all of their lives are but an epilogue to the main event.Narrating at the conclusion, the character Harper Lee comments that, in America, there is no attention paid to the ""small"" moments in your artistic life; instead, after the success, everyone asks, as only Americans can:  ""What's next?""This comment seemed so poignant, considering that, despite the success that still surroundsTo Kill a Mockingbird (Harper Perennial Modern Classics), this book was the main event for Harper Lee as well.The actors left their intriguing marks on the characters, adding a depth and humanity--even on the criminals--and also gave us a peek into the thoughts and feelings of the writers who turned the human moments into art.While I enjoyed this movie, I was disappointed that Harper Lee was portrayed as a footnote to Truman (or a sidekick), with only the occasional moments that revealed that she might be his moral compass as well.  I feel compelled to learn more about her, which is why I am currently readingMockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee, a portrait written by Charles J.

1043018,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000M341SC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","There would be an assumption that in the wake of the critical success of ""Truman,"" that another film looking at the story of how Truman Capote came to write his classic non-fiction novel ""In Cold Blood"" is as unnecessary as was the made for television remake of the 1967 film based on the book that featured the stunning black & white cinematography of Conrad Hall.  But director Douglas McGrath (""Company Man,"" ""Nicholas Nickerby"") is not exactly covering the same ground.  Whereas ""In Cold Blood"" was the story of the 1959 murders of the Cutter family in Holcomb, Kansas by Dick Hickok and Perry Smith, ""Capote"" tells the story of how Capote came to write the book.  The former ends with the hangings of Hickok and Smith, while the latter ends with Capote having attained the pinnacle of success in American letters only to never come close to such heights ever again.  ""Capote"" finds an obvious connection between the two, but does not really provide a definitive answer to nail down the cause and effect.  In ""Infamous,"" McGrath offers a more specific reason for why Capote was never the same after writing ""In Cold Blood.""One again Truman Capote (Toby Jones) sees an article about the murder of a Kansas farm family, goes off to see how such a horrendous crime affects a small American farm, and decides that he needs to write a book.  Despite the fact that he is like nothing they have ever seen in Kansas, Capote is able to ingratiate himself with Alvin Dewey (Jeff Daniels), the lead investigator for the local policy.  More importantly, when Hickok (Lee Pace) and Smith (Daniel Craig) are captured, Capote is able to interview them the murderers in prison and attend their execution.  Ultimately, it is the relationship between Capote and Smith that McGrath sees as being the key to the mystery of what happened to Truman Capote after writing ""In Cold Blood.""Of course there is the delicious irony that Capote is being hoisted by his own petard here.  McGrath developed his screenplay not from Capote's novel but rather from George Plimpton's book, ""Truman Capote: In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career.""  McGrath's attempt is justified by a couple of key details in the film regarding what is presented as evidence of Capote's creativity in writing ""In Cold Blood.""  The first is the most repeated line from the book, which is Perry Smith's statement: ""I didn't want to harm the man.  I thought he was a very nice gentleman.  Soft-spoken.  I thought so right up to the moment I cut his throat.""  The film makes it clear that while Smith might have made some comment along those lines, the final polished wording of the quotation was the result of Capote's refinement.  The second key point is when Smith offers an apology for his crime when he speaks his last words at his execution.  Capote is seen in the film urging him to do so, but Alvin Dewey ""testifies"" in the film that Smith said nothing on his way to the gallows.  Your second time through this 2006 film you are strongly urged to listen to the commentary track by McGrath, who shows up to explain and defend his film, and not just to recall anecdotes about making it.  I rounded up on the rating of this DVD just because of his first rate commentary.There is another irony in that Capote goes to Kansas with his close childhood friend Nelle Harper Lee (Sandra Bullock), since Lee wrote even less than Capote after the monumental success of ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""  It could easily be argued that neither one was ever going to come close, so living on their laurels made a sort of sense.  But if Lee only had one novel in her, Capote had written ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and other works that suggested a long and distinguished literary career should have been his legacy.  So while it is too bad that Lee never wrote another great American novel, there is much more of a sense of tragedy that Capote was broken by the experience of writing the book for which he will always be remembered.""Infamous"" is more about the celebrity of Capote, and not just because the film includes ""interviews"" with the likes of Babe Paley (Sigourney Weaver) and Bennett Cerf (Peter Bogdanovich).  Jones' Capote speaks a lot more than Philip Seymour Hoffman did in ""Capote,"" but then I felt Hoffman won the Oscar for key moments of silence in that film (e.g., when he sees the bodies of the Clutters at the funeral home).  Hoffman is 4 1/2 inches taller than the 5' 5"" Jones and this film takes much more advantage of the leading actor's shorter height to emphasize the writer as a strange little man who survives and flourishes in the big world because of the force of his intellect and personality.  The idea of seeing one film rather than the other strikes me as silly because they each stand on their own and even after watching not only both of these films but the original ""In Cold Blood"" (not to mention reading the book), you are still not going to have a full picture of the what really happened and how these people came to be who they were and meet their respective fates.  But you will have plenty to think about.",5,"Douglas McGrath's attempt to explain why ""In Cold Blood"" broke Truman Capote",1172793600,"03 2, 2007",2007,5129,"['would', 'be', 'assumption', 'wake',

This film certainly portrays Truman Capote much better than the the one with his name attached. Yes you do sort of feel as if he was playing himself, it is that good. I give it four stars instead of five because of the time spent on the Perry character, and the effort to make him seem almost human. There is no way I can see either killer as human when they brutally murdered an entire family. I don't care about his childhood, nor do I care to study why he may have evolved into a cold blooded individual. In some ways, it almost makes the farmer deserving of his fate for not having the supposed safe with cash on the premises. Further, it almost seems like he was doing them a favor by worrying about the son getting cold, or placing a pillow behind his head before the he was shot. Then both killers cry at the hanging, which does not move me at all, except to think about if they had not committed this brutal crime, nobody would be feeling bad. It's just that unnecessary to have killed this family. I believe the punishment fit the crime, although I am never a fan of seeing another human being die. I suppose you could call it artistic license to think Capote may have fell in love with the Perry guy, but it also could be another example of doing this because Capote was gay. That does not mean he had to fall for the guy, any more than a heterosexual man would. All in all, it is a very good portrayal of Truman Capote. The killers will always be just that in my book.

While Phillip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal may have been Oscar-worthy, Toby Jones really brings the pain here - the mincing walk, overdone eye gestures, and chalkboard-grating high voice are dead on.  Plus, you get the feel of his relationship with what were then ""true socialites"", Babe Paley (Sigourney Weaver), Slim Keith (Hope Davis) and Marella Agnelli (Isabella Rossellini), who kept it real by keeping their designer clothes on.  (Paris and Nicky Hilton could learn something about self-respect and dignity from just watching this film!)  The most scandalous thing that they appeared to have done was kick off their pumps and do the ""Twist"" to the sounds of Chubby Checker!Capote's murder masterpiece ""In Cold Blood"" was the very first ""true crime novel"" that I ever read.  It was chilling in a way that no other written account of a murder has been able to duplicate since.  In this film,  one not only gets an accurate account of the crime, you also get a look into the angst of the writer and what it must be like to be that close to such a heinous deed.  Truman Capote's later mental decline, substance abuse, and fall from society's fickle grace was not just the result of his inability to match this book, but from the unstable and dysfunctional life he had even before this, ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", and his other fabulous works.Sandra Bullock gives a stunning turn as Truman's childhood friend, writer Nell Harper Lee.  And David Craig's portrayal as killer Perry Smith is sympathetic and pathetic and raw.  You find yourself wishing that this was a work of fiction so that this time he wouldn't be executed.If all you know about Mr. Capote involves a disco ball, Andy Warhol, and Studio 54, watch this film before you watch anything else written or filmed about him.  The only other story about his life that really gives you a look into the man is ""in Cold Blood"".

And Daniel Craig too - menacing, sexy, intoxicating - you can see why this guy will pull off the lethal double-whammy - Bond for the boys - but films like ""Defiance"", ""The Mother"" and ""Flashbacks Of A Fool"" for challenging roles and acting chops.The story begins with much of the cast narrating their thoughts on Truman Capote via interview to the camera. They discuss with dispassion this odd little American writer who was also a world-class raconteur and smoozer. Particularly good are Juliet Stevenson as the socialite and Sandra Bullock as Harper Lee (author of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"").The story begins with Truman seeing a story in a newspaper about a family wiped out in small town America. He is drawn to it without really knowing why. He and Bullock travel to the town, but are stumped by paperwork. The town sheriff (downplayed subtly and beautifully by Jeff Daniels) won't play ball and allow either access to anything to do with the case. So Truman does what he does best - he wheedles his way into the sheriff's family and their affections with his charm and tales of famous folks (a trick he uses in the interviews in jail). Then the real murderers get caught and Truman gets stuck in on both of them knowing that these scumbags want their sordid stories told. And on it goes...The support cast is uniformly superb too - Sigourney Weaver, Hope Davis, Isabella Rossellini and Gwyneth Paltrow - all actresses of real talent and power.""Infamous"" made me like a man who some would say was superfluous to Humanity's requirements - a person who tested your patience - who was outside the norm - but used his wit, intelligence and verbal cunning to rise above the ridicule he so often evoked.""Infamous"" is a thought-provoking story about a complex, clever, irritating, pretentious and ultimately fascinating person - a tale added to by the central performance - and not dominated by it (as Phillip Seymour Hoffman did in the more lauded ""Capote"" movie).I thought it was a fantastic film - and with a great cast delivering on all fronts.Highly recommended (and roll on the BLU RAY reissue).",4,"""...Infamy!

1043029,AA0Y6M1TKHNHN,B000M341SC,Michael Walter,"[1, 1]","In Infamous, two extremes tangle. There's Truman Capote (Toby Jones), a sophisticate, a writer, the crown jewel of an in-the-know set of friends. Capote's opposite is Perry Jones (Daniel Craig), an uneducated killer held in a Kansas jail for his involvement in a set of brutal murders. The film's subject: Capote's writing of ""In Cold Blood,"" a revolutionary piece of 1960s journalism about those murders. The movie has it that, in order to write the book, Capote risks his ability to ignore and dismiss things that might break his heart.Writer and director Douglas McGrath gives the film's themes and characters nuanced interplay. He sees these men whole. Capote and Jones are part of larger systems and essential philosophical concerns; most things here have a dual nature. The film bristles with questions: what role does creativity play in reporting the facts? What is masculinity, and how should it be expressed in a social context? These questions are balanced by the superb fluidity of Capote's clever, insightful humor. That humor gives the film merciless edges.Despite its off-putting use of an interview format, Infamous' pace is both brisk and languid. Maybe it's that well-contrasted color and that beautiful camera work; maybe it's the fascinating characters portrayed, a list that includes Sandra Bullock's Harper Lee and Signourney Weaver's Babe Paley; no doubt it is due in large part to McGrath's thoughtfulness and confidence as a story-teller.

Boschee,"[1, 1]","I have been fascinated by Truman Capote's life ever since I found out that the character of Dill in Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird' was based on him as a child. I watched In Cold Blood the night before I watched this movie because I'd never seen it and because I wanted the &#34;back story&#34;. Well, I must say I enjoyed the first much more than this one. I think Toby Jones did a wonderful impersonation of Truman Capote but it's little more than that. For all his rubbing his face and whining about how much the research for his book took out of him, I wasn't convinced. I think TC's was a truly tragic story of a truly tragic little man but this movie shed no further light on him or his life than that which I had already known. Sandra Bullock also does a very fine impersonation of Harper Lee but again, it's little more than that. I guess you'd have to blame the writing or direction, (I don't claim to be a film critic), because Ms Bullock can certainly make you feel like you know the character she's playing in most of her better movies. It's a shame too because Harper Lee is a somewhat tragic figure, as well.

""Capote"" painted broader strokes while ""Infamous"" was somewhat more specific. Lastly, Toby Jones was simply overshadowed by the more popular, Phillip Seymour Hoffman,I vividly remember Truman Capote on the TV talk-show circuit and Toby captured the same deliberately profound annoyance that Capote seemed to wallow in.  I read ""In Cold Blood"" in high school and it was indeed an excellent book - quite well-written, though chilling in its subject matter as well as the treatment.  But as a personality, Truman was a most uncomfortable sight - I readily admit that my being a black, gay teenager certainly colored (no pun intended) my perceptions. Tennesse Williams & James Baldwin, both gay literary contemporaries of Capote were equally uncomfortable, (and equally talented/troubled).""Infamous"" deals most intimately with Capote's relationship with Perry while researching and writing ""In Cold Blood"".  The performances of Jones & Daniel Craig are at the core of the movie. Their performances are wrenching and give the implications the movie makes enormous credibility. Sandra Bullock as Harper Lee, the author of 'To Kill A Mockingbird"" (another classic) is simply wonderful.  Quite frankly, it is some of the best work I have ever seen from her.Even more interesting is that this particular perspective of the machinations behind the famous novel still take a back seat to a much more intimate situation lots of people find themselves in but that is rarely so beautifully addressed.It is this aspect of the movie that made the biggest impression upon me.In the beginning, it is obvious Capote is totally opportunistic in his quest to actually interview one of the killers.  His book is his focal point.  The film wonderully suggests that Capote was just as shocked (and pleased) to realize he cared deeply for Perry - and Perry for him.  And this was not an easy road for either to travel. More importanly, the evolution of their relationship was not based on their sexuality.This is a classic example of individual instances (quite common) where a gay/lesbian person forges a close relationship with someone straight - both sides initially having serious apprehensions about the other, only to have this complicated with genuine feelings developing on both sides. The inevitable result is that neither side knows quite how to deal with those genuine feelings.  After wading through all the mud, the lesson learned is that two people, if they allow themselves to, can forget race, color, age, economics, gender, or any other useless category and simply allow themselves to genuinely care about each other. (yeah, it went there for me)I mean to take nothing away from Hoffman's ""Capote"". Both films provide insight; they present two alternative perspectives and I highly recommend both projects.It is simply that as an art form 'Infamous"" more closely meets the general objective I believe all art forms aspire to - to open/elevate the dialogue.",5,"More Compelling Than ""Capote""",1213833600,"06 19, 2008",2008,3105,"['Comparions', 'Hoffman', 'Capote', 'are', 'inevitable', 'given', 'proximity', 'two', 'releases', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'two', 'films', 'deal', 'exactly', 'same', 'subject', 'Capote', 'painted', 'broader', 'strokes', 'Infamous', 'was', 'somewhat', 'more', 'specific', 'Lastly', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'was', 'simply', 'overshadowed', 'more', 'popular', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'vividly', 'remember', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'TV', 'talk-show', 'circuit', 'Toby', 'captured', 'same', 'deliberately', 'profound', 'annoyance', 'Capote', 'seemed', 'wallow', 'read', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'indeed', 'excellent', 'book', 'quite', 'well-written', 'chilling', 'subject', 'matter', 'as', 'well', 'treatment', 'personality', 'Truman', 'was', 'most', 'uncomfortable', 'sight', 'readily', 'admit', 'being', 'black', 'gay', 'teenager', 'certainly', 'colored', 'pun', 'intended', 'perceptions', 'Tennesse', 'Williams', 'James', 'Baldwin', 'gay', 'literary', 'contemporaries', 'Capote', 'were', 'equally', 'uncomfortable', 'equally', 'talented/troubled', 'Infamous', 'deals', 'most', 'intimately', 'Capote', 'relationship', 'Perry', 'researching', 'writing', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'performances', 'Jones', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'are', 'core', 'movie', 'performances', 'are', 'wrenching', 'give', 'implications', 'movie', 'enormous', 'credibility', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'author', ""'To"", 'Kill', 'A', 'Mockingbird', 'classic', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'best', 'work', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'her.Even', 'more', 'interesting', 'particular', 'perspective', 'machinations', 'famous', 'novel', 'still', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'much', 'more', 'intimate', 'situation', 'lots', 'people', 'find', 'rarely', 'so', 'beautifully', 'addressed.It', 'aspect', 'movie', 'made', 'biggest', 'impression', 'beginning', 'obvious', 'Capote', 'totally', 'opportunistic', 'quest', 'actually', 'interview', 'one', 'killers', 'book', 'focal', 'point', 'film', 'wonderully', 'Capote', 'was', 'just', 'shocked', 'pleased', 'realize', 'cared', 'deeply', 'Perry', 'Perry', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'road', 'travel', 'More', 'importanly', 'evolution', 'relationship', 'was', 'not', 'based', 'sexuality.This', 'classic', 'example', 'individual', 'instances', 'quite', 'common', 'where', 'gay/lesbian', 'person', 'close', 'relationship', 'someone', 'straight', 'sides', 'initially', 'having', 'serious', 'apprehensions', 'other', 'only', 'have', 'complicated', 'genuine', 'feelings', 'developing', 'sides', 'inevitable', 'result', 'side', 'quite', 'how', 'deal', 'genuine', 'feelings', 'wading', 'mud', 'lesson', 'learned', 'two', 'people', 'allow', 'can', 'forget', 'race', 'color', 'age', 'economics', 'gender', 'other', 'useless', 'category', 'simply', 'allow', 'genuinely', 'care', 'other', 'yeah', 'went', 'there', 'mean', 'take', 'nothing', 'away', 'Hoffman', 'Capote', 'films', 'provide', 'insight', 'present', 'two', 'alternative', 'perspectives', 'highly', 'recommend', 'projects.It', 'simply', 'art', 'form', ""'Infamous"", 'more', 'closely', 'general', 'objective', 'believe', 'art', 'forms', 'aspire', 'open/elevate', 'dialogue']",N/A

I must say that although Hoffman has certainly earned his Oscar, Toby Jones was even better in his portrayal of the famous New Yorker writer.  Script for ""Infamous"" is better because it shows in more depth how complex and entertaining Capote as a human being truly was.  His weird voice, demeanor and dressing almost no longer matter after we get to know him.  He seduces us with his wit and sensitivity.

I'm often amused when talented actors win Oscars playing against ""type"". Hoffman was certainly fine, but so was Toby Jones, who looked a lot more like the diminuative enigma known as Truman Capote. Both presented a Capote, reasonably free of carricature, with confidence and focus. These 2 films are basically the same story, but I must admit that ""Infamous"" delved a little deeper to present more of Capote's motivations and inspiration. Indeed, a film titled ""Capote"", might've included his birth, youth, and subsequent situations, which led him to become the eventual icon of pop culture that he was. The despair he felt after getting to know the real Perry Smith was much better realized by Mr. Jones, in my opinion. Actors against type who've won Oscars might include Charlize Theron, Tom Hanks (Philadelphia) and Dustin Hoffman (Rain Man), and certainly P.S. Hoffman (though Terrence Howard deserved it that year). And who can forget Linda Hunt in ""The Year of Living Dangerously""?  Sandra Bullock was as good a Harper Lee as Ms. Keener. I guess it's all in the timing.

It's a shame because this movie is very good, and definitely worth seeing.  However, it looks like it was too soon for its release; it was shunned in the theaters.The movie does a very good job of capturing atmosphere, not only is its sets and costumes (which definitely evoke the period) but in the way the camera frames shots and moves throughout the film.  Director Douglas McGrath moves the film along at the perfect speed, allowing the audience time with Truman, and Nelle.  He also controls the mood of the film, letting us laugh and scoff at Truman's antics with his rich friends.  However when things need to get serious, the film turns slowly into a tragic image of a man being destroyed by his desire to create.  The only moments where the film falters is during a series of fake documentary interviews.  They serve to pull us out of the movie, instead of pull us in (as I suspect they were intended to do).  The score is solid, adding to the scenes, but not standing out in any way.In a movie like this performances are key.  Praise must be given to Toby Jones who seems to inhabit the character.  From the moment he is on screen, I believed that I was watching Truman Capote and not an actor portraying him.  Toby is able to make Truman likable, annoying, cold, kind, and desperate whenever he needs to, and in a completely believable way.  Also surprising is Sandra Bullock as Nelle Harper Lee.  Sandra's performance is very natural and provides the perfect foil to Toby's performance.  I also enjoyed Daniel Craig as Perry Smith.  His intensity served him very well in the part.  The supporting cast was just as good providing many familiar faces in key parts.""Infamous"" was a good evenings entertainment.

1043044,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B000M341SC,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[54, 57]","Based on interviews in George Plimpton's oral biography of Truman Capote, this well done film offers a somewhat different take on the character we'd already come to know through the previous year's ""Capote,"" which covers the same storyline - the writing of the author's bestseller, ""In Cold Blood."" Toby Jones gives a notable performance that emphasizes Capote's vulnerability - reinforced by the actor's diminutive size - compared to the more arch and self-centered  Oscar-winning portrayal turned in by Philip Seymour Hoffman. While both films show how Capote is overwhelmed by the stress of composing this landmark book and waiting for its publication as the two killers are held for years on death row, ""Infamous"" wants us to believe that Capote fell deeply in love with one of them, Perry, who returned his affection and regarded him to the end as ""Friend Truman."" That Capote never wrote anything of the caliber of ""In Cold Blood"" again and spent the rest of his years in a downward spiral of self destruction is used in the film as evidence that it was the fateful encounter with Perry that ruined him.Sandra Bullock gives a wonderfully controlled performance as Capote's lifelong friend Harper Lee, who after the success of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" never published another novel and left New York to return to her childhood home in Alabama, where fate provided a much more congenial retreat from the limelight. ""Who knows what the heart wants,"" she remarks sadly at the end of the film, ""and who can defend themselves against it?"" And while the film treats its subject with a certain playfulness, reflected in a mostly cheerful and larky soundtrack, it is finally the story of a broken heart. The DVD has a very cogent and informative commentary by writer-director Douglas McGrath. Definitely worth watching, even if you've seen ""Capote.""

Schultz,"[7, 7]","This movie starring Toby Jones as Truman Capote covers almost the same ground as the Academy Award-nominated film ""Capote,"" starring Philip Seymour Hoffman. I'm not sure why two such similar movies appeared at almost the same time. But actually of the two, I found this Jones movie to be the more absorbing. If you only have the time or inclination to watch one dramatization of Truman Capote's writing of ""In Cold Blood,"" I suggest this movie be the one.It doesn't have the cachet of Hoffman's performance. But neither does it have the sometimes annoying tone of self-importance of that other film. Nor does this movie have some of the anachronistic locutions found in ""Capote."" It is truer to Capote's wit and way of telling a story.Best of all though, ""Infamous"" shows much more of the gossipy society circle that Capote generally inhabited. Juliet Stevenson turns in a priceless and all-too-brief performance as fashion editor Diana Vreeland.There is also more texture to Capote's relationship with killer Perry Smith here. I'm not sure how much of the more developed romance shown in this movie is conjecture, but it makes for a heartbreaking love story. Daniel Craig turns in a gripping performance as the dark, vulnerable and volatile Smith.Director Douglas McGrath provides a very interesting, literate commentary on the DVD. His accompanying thoughts run like a polished essay, without being at all pretentious. He becomes another character in the unfolding biography, a character most of us would probably like to get to know better.All-in-all, we do get to know the wit and wiliness Capote better through this film.

Not only is Jones a much better Capote than Hoffman, but this movie is superior to  Capote, it's funnier, the backstory of Capote's life is much richer and nuanced and the supporting actors are better.  Jones channels Capote, he lets the viewer understand why everybody wanted to be around this man and why he was such a sensation, he also showed Capote's darker side and how to him the ends always justifed the means, no matter how manipulative he had to be.  I also liked Bullock as Harper Lee, her accent came and went, but her performance was well done, she was the only person that really knew Capote and she was the only one would could really call him out on his hypocracy; he could not fool her.

George Plimpton's book, for which this movie was based upon, first introduced me to Truman years ago when I picked the book up in a bookstore and couldn't put it down.  Although I have yet to experience such a life, I think I see a lot of myself in T.C.  Demeanor. Deep southern background.  Yearning for acceptance.  A love for writing.  The voice even.I took a day's vacation from work to see the movie CAPOTE in the theater a few years back.  I thought Phillip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman was a good imitation and honest.  A much deserved Oscar win. But that movie was more about what the book did for Truman as a writer, and it was the shell of how he went about writing it, putting Holcomb Kansas on the map.  As discussed in Plimpton's book, this story was much more personal to Truman.  It made him, and it broke him.  The movie, Infamous, is about nothing but this raw and true feeling that Truman (both the writer and the human) experienced during those years.  I embrace this movie for daring to go there.Just like the book, Infamous offers up snippets of interviews of those who knew Truman well...Gore Vidal, Jack Dunphy, Harper Lee.  Think of it as if you were at a cocktail party and going room to room overhearing bits of conversation.  The movie is laced with such dialogue to keep the story moving along beautifully.Toby Jones IS Truman, and makes you quickly forget how good Hoffman was.  The storyline does a great job at showing you how Truman was looked at as an eccentric outcast, and how he probably stuck out like a sore thumb in Kansas.  But people came to like him; they warmed up to him.  He was the life of the party.  This movie shows Truman the clown, quick with a catchy one liner, everybody's friend...but by the end it opens Truman up a little.  You see his feelings, his ""tru"" character, his heart.The relationship he had with Perry Smith is also treated honestly.  I believed it.  It's exactly what I had taken from the book.  I want to believe that Truman fell in love with Smith.  I want to believe that maybe Smith loved him back.  Maybe they shared a kiss.  There is proof of their letter writing, but not much else.  So forget about ""for the record,"" and take away what you too want to believe.One other interesting story that neither movie goes into is that supposedly Truman bought the two prisoners gravestones which were quickly stolen.  A few years ago those gravestones were recovered and are on display in a museum in Kansas.  That's not important to my review, but it is interesting.If you are a TC fan, or just a fan of southern literature, set aside some time to devote to this film.  It is a haunting story, that today in the age of the internet and computers, we may never experience in society in such a way again.  Truman was an infamous writing legend in his own, and I would have loved to have known him.",5,"Each time we get it right, we die a little...",1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,2953,"['Having', 'been', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'fan', 'many', 'years', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'film', 'George', 'Plimpton', 'book', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'first', 'introduced', 'Truman', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'picked', 'book', 'up', 'bookstore', 'could', ""n't"", 'put', 'down', 'have', 'yet', 'experience', 'life', 'think', 'see', 'lot', 'T.C', 'Demeanor', 'Deep', 'southern', 'background', 'Yearning', 'acceptance', 'love', 'writing', 'voice', 'even.I', 'took', 'day', 'vacation', 'work', 'see', 'movie', 'CAPOTE', 'theater', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'thought', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'portrayal', 'Truman', 'was', 'good', 'imitation', 'honest', 'much', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'win', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'what', 'book', 'did', 'Truman', 'writer', 'was', 'shell', 'how', 'went', 'writing', 'putting', 'Holcomb', 'Kansas', 'map', 'discussed', 'Plimpton', 'book', 'story', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'personal', 'Truman', 'made', 'broke', 'movie', 'Infamous', 'nothing', 'raw', 'true', 'feeling', 'Truman', 'writer', 'human', 'experienced', 'years', 'embrace', 'movie', 'daring', 'go', 'there.Just', 'book', 'Infamous', 'up', 'snippets', 'interviews', 'who', 'knew', 'Truman', 'well', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'Jack', 'Dunphy', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'Think', 'were', 'cocktail', 'party', 'going', 'room', 'room', 'overhearing', 'bits', 'conversation', 'movie', 'laced', 'such', 'dialogue', 'keep', 'story', 'moving', 'along', 'beautifully.Toby', 'Jones', 'IS', 'Truman', 'quickly', 'forget', 'how', 'good', 'Hoffman', 'was', 'storyline', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'Truman', 'was', 'looked', 'eccentric', 'outcast', 'how', 'probably', 'stuck', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'Kansas', 'people', 'came', 'warmed', 'up', 'was', 'life', 'party', 'movie', 'Truman', 'clown', 'quick', 'catchy', 'one', 'liner', 'everybody', 'friend', 'end', 'Truman', 'up', 'little', 'see', 'feelings', 'tru', 'character', 'heart.The', 'relationship', 'had', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'also', 'treated', 'honestly', 'believed', 'exactly', 'what', 'had', 'taken', 'book', 'want', 'believe', 'Truman', 'fell', 'love', 'Smith', 'want', 'believe', 'maybe', 'Smith', 'loved', 'back', 'Maybe', 'shared', 'kiss', 'proof', 'letter', 'writing', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'So', 'forget', 'record', 'take', 'away', 'what', 'too', 'want', 'believe.One', 'other', 'interesting', 'story', 'movie', 'supposedly', 'Truman', 'bought', 'two', 'prisoners', 'gravestones', 'were', 'quickly', 'stolen', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'gravestones', 'were', 'recovered', 'are', 'display', 'museum', 'Kansas', 'not', 'important', 'review', 'interesting.If', 'are', 'TC', 'fan', 'just', 'fan', 'southern', 'literature', 'set', 'aside', 'time', 'devote', 'film', 'haunting', 'story', 'today', 'age', 'internet', 'computers', 'may', 'never', 'experience', 'society', 'such', 'way', 'again', 'Truman', 'was', 'infamous', 'writing', 'legend', 'own', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'known']",N/A

I was really taken in by the opening of the film. The acting is exquisite (but frankly not as convincing as Capote). Certain portions are very funny.The beginning and end contain ""documentary style"" interviews which just frankly didn't work for me. On a whole the movie works. It's touching. It's poignant. As a historian and as a writer, there were elements of it I found fascinating. That said, there were little inconsistencies that I found rather annoying. For example, the book makes clear how a crowd had gathered when Smith and Hickock are being brought to the jail. They were late and there was worry (unduly) that there might be a lynch mob. However in the movie it shows people running toward the police station in broad daylight as though it were an ad hoc event. Worse, Perry Smith's portrayal of his childhood relationship is significantly off. The way they show him next to ""Andy"" prior to the trial is off. Perry was kept alone in the woman's quarters of the local prison until after the trial. Showing Dick pulling the trigger on the women was eventually contradicted even in the book. There are others and they're fairly major points.So it was enjoyable and touching. I feel this movie brings out more of a way Truman Capote must have been. A born storyteller. Someone who got people's confidences. The movie shows how he did it...even better in certain ways than Capote did. The acting performances in Capote are, however, more genuine.

Or when DEEP IMPACT and ARMAGGEDON dueled at the multiplex?It even happens with serious art films.CAPOTE made it out first, fetching Philip Seymour Hoffman an Academy Award for his brilliant performance.  Then INFAMOUS came out...with a brilliant performance from Toby Jones as Truman Capote.Between these two films, I read the biography that served as the basis for CAPOTE and got a lot of insight into the life of Capote.

(Also, after listening to the commentary on CAPOTE, I heard Philip Seymour Hoffman talk about how he ended up playing certain scenes differently from the script--improvised acting that added a sympathy for the character that would not have been there otherwise).If you enjoyed CAPOTE, I think you should definitely check out INFAMOUS.  There's a great cast, a broader sweep of Capote's life, and an interesting insight into how the book came about...and its harsh consequences.But I also enjoyed (and appreciated) both TOMBSTONE and WYATT EARP.

1043058,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000M341SC,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[3, 5]","Sometimes coming in second can be a good thing. While ""Capote"" stole the awards and the box office, ""Infamous"" covering much of the same ground involving writer Truman Capote fashioning his ""novel"" In Cold Blood surprised me by how much better it was as a drama and how much richer the performances were. I say surprised because of the structure of the film and the fact that I had ""seen"" this story already in its predecessor. ***Director/writer Mark McGrath (""Emma"" and the TV version of ""Nickolas Nickleby"") makes some fascinating and daring choices here. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD By implying that Capote fell in love with Smith, McGrath suggests his artistic decline and fall into despair pushed the writer into alcoholism ultimately destroying his art and, in the process, making him a shell of his former self. Dramatically it touches on what truly was missing behind the story that drove ""Capote"". Keith proves himself every bit the equal of Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffmann and I personally found his performance more nuanced, richer and with a deeper sense of humanity and vulnerability. Adapted from the book by the late journalist George Plimpton, McGrath makes the choice of putting intermittent interviews with the actors in character. While this is disruptive (much like ""Reds"") at first, if you're patient you'll discover that the contrast between what we see happening and what they say happened provides an additional perspective missing from ""Capote"".Capote (Toby Keith) intrigued by the brutal murder of a family in a small rural Kansas town arranges to write an article for The New Yorker magazine. Capote already well known at the time having published six previous books so thinks he'll have no problem getting the town's people to talk to him about the family and the tragic events. He takes along his best friend Harper Lee who is waiting for her book To Kill a Mockingbird to be published. Lee provides the humanity and warmth missing from Capote who is witty, sarcastic and just doesn't fit in as a flamboyant gay man in the early 60's in Kansas. When the police officer investigating the case (Jeff Daniels) refuses to give him special access about the case, Capote finds that Lee is right-he has to open up himself to a certain extent but, more importantly, use those he knows (Humphrey Bogart, Frank Sinatra, Lauren Bacall and other celebrities he worked with at the time) to impress and break the ice for the locals. Once the killer's are caught Capote finds himself drawn into their world particularly that of Perry Smith (Daniel Craig from ""Casino Royale"", ""Layer Cake"" and ""Munich"" in a stunning performance). Capote has to put aside his defenses and truly open up to Smith who hides a soft, almost artistic soul beneath his hardened exterior.""Infamous"" receives a top notch transfer. Images are crisp, colors bright and the Kansas landscape is captured in all of its stark beauty. In contrast the sequences set in Manhattan with Capote's society friends (played by Hope Davis, Sigourney Weaver, Peter Bogdanovich as his publisher and, Gwyneth Paltrow, Isabella Rossellini, Juliet Stevenson) are bright, cheery looking as if we are in a perpetual party. Audio is as crisp as a cold morning in Kansas. ---Director Mark McGrath provides a feature length commentary that is often fascinating focusing on everything from the creative decision he made for the opening nightclub sequence to why he chose to cast his film the way he did. Surprisingly, McGrath doesn't discuss the competing film which would have made the commentary catty (I'm sure he disagreed with the choices of director Bennett Miller and writer Dan Futterman made for their film) and that's to his credit. We also get the original theatrical trailer but no featurettes on Capote, the impact of his relationship with Perry and how McGrath believes it contributed to his artistic decline and fall into alcoholism.In this case second place proves to be more fruitful for the viewer-""Infamous"" speculates on the relationship between Perry and Capote but much of what director/writer McGrath does makes artistic sense even if we truly will never know how much of this is true. The film is more compelling than ""Capote"" and daring as well with its unusual structure which includes intermittent ""interviews"" with the actors in character discussing Truman Capote, In Cold Blood and the impact it had on his career and, ultimately, his life.",4,"Very good movie looking at same situations as ""Capote""",1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,4432,"['Sometimes', 'coming', 'second', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'Capote', 'stole', 'awards', 'box', 'office', 'Infamous', 'covering', 'much', 'same', 'ground', 'involving', 'writer', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'fashioning', 'novel', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'drama', 'how', 'much', 'richer', 'performances', 'were', 'say', 'surprised', 'structure', 'film', 'fact', 'had', 'seen', 'story', 'already', 'predecessor', '***Director/writer', 'Mark', 'McGrath', 'Emma', 'TV', 'version', 'Nickolas', 'Nickleby', 'fascinating', 'daring', 'choices', 'here', 'WARNING', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'implying', 'Capote', 'fell', 'love', 'Smith', 'McGrath', 'artistic', 'decline', 'fall', 'despair', 'pushed', 'writer', 'alcoholism', 'ultimately', 'destroying', 'art', 'process', 'making', 'shell', 'former', 'self', 'Dramatically', 'what', 'truly', 'was', 'missing', 'story', 'drove', 'Capote', 'Keith', 'bit', 'equal', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffmann', 'personally', 'found', 'performance', 'more', 'nuanced', 'richer', 'deeper', 'sense', 'humanity', 'vulnerability', 'Adapted', 'book', 'late', 'journalist', 'George', 'Plimpton', 'McGrath', 'choice', 'putting', 'intermittent', 'interviews', 'actors', 'character', 'disruptive', 'much', 'Reds', 'first', ""'re"", 'patient', ""'ll"", 'discover', 'contrast', 'what', 'see', 'happening', 'what', 'say', 'happened', 'additional', 'perspective', 'missing', 'Capote', '.Capote', 'Toby', 'Keith', 'intrigued', 'brutal', 'murder', 'family', 'small', 'rural', 'Kansas', 'town', 'arranges', 'write', 'article', 'New', 'Yorker', 'magazine', 'Capote', 'already', 'well', 'known', 'time', 'having', 'published', 'six', 'previous', 'books', 'so', ""'ll"", 'have', 'problem', 'getting', 'town', 'people', 'talk', 'family', 'tragic', 'events', 'best', 'friend', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'who', 'waiting', 'book', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'be', 'published', 'Lee', 'humanity', 'warmth', 'missing', 'Capote', 'who', 'witty', 'sarcastic', 'just', ""n't"", 'fit', 'flamboyant', 'gay', 'man', 'early', '60', 'Kansas', 'When', 'police', 'officer', 'investigating', 'case', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'give', 'special', 'access', 'case', 'Capote', 'Lee', 'right-he', 'open', 'up', 'certain', 'extent', 'more', 'importantly', 'use', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'other', 'celebrities', 'worked', 'time', 'impress', 'break', 'ice', 'locals', 'killer', 'are', 'caught', 'Capote', 'drawn', 'world', 'particularly', 'Perry', 'Smith', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'Munich', 'stunning', 'performance', 'Capote', 'put', 'aside', 'defenses', 'truly', 'open', 'up', 'Smith', 'who', 'soft', 'almost', 'artistic', 'soul', 'hardened', 'exterior', 'Infamous', 'top', 'notch', 'transfer', 'Images', 'are', 'crisp', 'colors', 'bright', 'Kansas', 'landscape', 'captured', 'stark', 'beauty', 'contrast', 'sequences', 'set', 'Manhattan', 'Capote', 'society', 'friends', 'played', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'publisher', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'are', 'bright', 'cheery', 'looking', 'are', 'perpetual', 'party', 'Audio', 'as', 'crisp', 'cold', 'morning', 'Kansas', '-Director', 'Mark', 'McGrath', 'feature', 'length', 'commentary', 'often', 'fascinating', 'focusing', 'everything', 'creative', 'decision', 'made', 'opening', 'nightclub', 'sequence', 'why', 'chose', 'cast', 'film', 'way', 'did', 'Surprisingly', 'McGrath', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'competing', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'commentary', 'catty', ""'m"", 'sure', 'disagreed', 'choices', 'director', 'Bennett', 'Miller', 'writer', 'Dan', 'Futterman', 'made', 'film', 'credit', 'also', 'get', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'featurettes', 'Capote', 'impact', 'relationship', 'Perry', 'how', 'McGrath', 'contributed', 'artistic', 'decline', 'fall', 'alcoholism.In', 'case', 'second', 'place', 'be', 'more', 'fruitful', 'viewer-', 'Infamous', 'speculates', 'relationship', 'Perry', 'Capote', 'much', 'what', 'director/writer', 'McGrath', 'artistic', 'sense', 'even', 'truly', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'true', 'film', 'more', 'compelling', 'Capote', 'daring', 'as', 'well', 'unusual', 'structure', 'intermittent', 'interviews', 'actors', 'character', 'discussing', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'impact', 'had', 'career', 'ultimately', 'life']",N/A

Freeman ""Zach""","[3, 5]","Comparing Infamous to Capote is inevitable, not just because they are both about Truman Capote, but they both center around the period in Capote's life when he was writing In Cold Blood, and his relationship with the Dick Hickock and Perry Smith. (Not to mention the fact that they came out only a year apart). For all their similarities, the two movies are very different. Infamous focuses much more on the bouyant gabbish lifestyle Truman carried on, gossiping in restaurants with various friends. Also, an intense relationship develops between Perry and Truman that many historians question, and which ""Capote"" made no mention of.Toby Jones is brilliant as Capote, so much so that it's hard to imagine that he is not actually the little, flamboyant man brought back to life to play himself. Jones probably would have gotten much more acclaim for his portrayal if Phillip Seymour Hoffman hadn't already won the Oscar for the role. It's hard to get the public interested again in after such critical success of the first.At times the interview technique employed to provide background on some scenes is a bit awkward. It doesn't seem to flow with the rest of the film, but seems more like a faux documentary aspect of another script. Other than those sequences, the film flows remarkably well. Flashing from Kansas to New York, fancy dinner table to prison cell, Capote is constantly atwitter about his new novel. Slowly it begins to dawn on him how intense the situation really is, and how painful it will be for him to see the killers hanged for their crimes.Although the film isn't terribly memorable, it's worth watching. It's every bit as good as Capote, and offers much more comic relief than the first movie.
