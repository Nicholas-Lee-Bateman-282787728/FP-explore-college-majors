I loved the transvestite character, Cyndi and that whole relationship with Mark seemed very real. Also loved Anne Heche's guest appearances! The ending of this season is so sad to me because I know it was Downey Jr's personal life and personal drug habit (which he hadnt kicked yet) that forced his character to leave the show and sent the 5th season into a disorganized tailspin.",5,"Robert Downey Jr, brings Ally back to life.",1383091200,"10 30, 2013",2013,519,"['1st', '2nd', 'seasons', 'are', 'still', 'champs', '4th', 'season', 'opinion', 'back', 'lot', 'spunk', 'had', 'when', 'lost', 'Billy', 'loved', 'transvestite', 'character', 'Cyndi', 'whole', 'relationship', 'Mark', 'seemed', 'very', 'real', 'Also', 'loved', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'guest', 'appearances', 'ending', 'season', 'so', 'sad', 'know', 'was', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'personal', 'life', 'personal', 'drug', 'habit', 'kicked', 'yet', 'forced', 'character', 'leave', 'show', 'sent', '5th', 'season', 'disorganized', 'tailspin']",N/A

1275306,A3HETHW2XD3DWH,B002KQ6UDS,frisky2000,"[7, 7]","I became a fan of this show with this season thanks in large part to the special season appearance of Robert Downey Jr.  His portral of Larry Paul, a new attorney at the law firm, was both charismatic and tender at the same time.  He is a natural in this part.  His banter with Ally is endearing, his interaction with John and the other attorneys is at times hilarious and at other times artful in his delivery of quick witted comebacks and stellar observations.  The season brings us full circle with the relationships Larry has with the entire cast, and by the season finale, you want him to be there for season five.  I won't spoil anything, but be prepared with a box of Kleenex for some of these episodes which deal with love, loss, and separation, not necessarily in that order.Aside from loving every episode featuring Larry Paul, guest star Anne Heche was sweet and quirky in a continuous story line that featured a very special homeless man, a magical apartment, and an affinity for Mr. Cage.  But my stand out favorite was The Getaway where John and Richard attempt a weekend trip to L.A.  What ensues from the moment they arrive at the airport till they reach California will split your sides.....one of the funniest shows of the entire season.More than any other television series, Ally McBeal gave new meaning to finding a soundtrack to your life.  The Barry White visions and songs by Sting and Manilow added to the healing power of music this season.I loved this show for its odd characters, special guests, deeper themes and often heartfelt messages of hope amidst personal despair.  It found a way to be clever, sometimes irreverent but always funny.  The music played throughout always hits a nerve with what has gone on in that particular episode.  If you've seen the show up till this season but didn't totally love it, I recommend this season four to win you over.",5,Fantastic,1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,1885,"['became', 'fan', 'show', 'season', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'special', 'season', 'appearance', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'portral', 'Larry', 'Paul', 'new', 'attorney', 'law', 'firm', 'was', 'charismatic', 'tender', 'same', 'time', 'natural', 'part', 'banter', 'Ally', 'endearing', 'interaction', 'John', 'other', 'attorneys', 'times', 'hilarious', 'other', 'times', 'artful', 'delivery', 'quick', 'witted', 'comebacks', 'stellar', 'observations', 'season', 'full', 'circle', 'relationships', 'Larry', 'entire', 'cast', 'season', 'finale', 'want', 'be', 'there', 'season', 'five', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'be', 'prepared', 'box', 'Kleenex', 'episodes', 'deal', 'love', 'loss', 'separation', 'not', 'necessarily', 'order.Aside', 'loving', 'episode', 'featuring', 'Larry', 'Paul', 'guest', 'star', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'was', 'sweet', 'quirky', 'continuous', 'story', 'line', 'featured', 'very', 'special', 'homeless', 'man', 'magical', 'apartment', 'affinity', 'Mr.', 'Cage', 'stand', 'favorite', 'was', 'Getaway', 'where', 'John', 'Richard', 'attempt', 'weekend', 'trip', 'L.A.', 'What', 'moment', 'arrive', 'airport', 'till', 'reach', 'California', 'will', 'split', 'sides', '..one', 'funniest', 'shows', 'entire', 'season.More', 'other', 'television', 'series', 'Ally', 'McBeal', 'gave', 'new', 'meaning', 'finding', 'soundtrack', 'life', 'Barry', 'White', 'visions', 'songs', 'Sting', 'Manilow', 'added', 'healing', 'power', 'music', 'season.I', 'loved', 'show', 'odd', 'characters', 'special', 'guests', 'deeper', 'themes', 'often', 'heartfelt', 'messages', 'hope', 'personal', 'despair', 'found', 'way', 'be', 'clever', 'sometimes', 'irreverent', 'always', 'funny', 'music', 'played', 'always', 'nerve', 'what', 'gone', 'particular', 'episode', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'show', 'up', 'till', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'totally', 'love', 'recommend', 'season', 'four', 'win', 'over']",N/A
