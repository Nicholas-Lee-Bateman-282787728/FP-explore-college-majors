Watching their relationship evolve was fun. The movie had a lot of underlying themes, but the theme I left with was that Romance is still alive and well.  You can have romance WITHOUT it always leading to hitting the sheets.  Allen Payne's character, Van truly romanced Fox (Victoria Dillard) and showed there was more to him than just his physical appearance(although it was great to watch).  It's wonderful seeing that quality in a man, we don't have enough that in our society. I'm glad I purchased this movie.

Her health suffers from that and she ends up having to take time off and spend time away from the hustle and bustle of New York City. She heads south to reconnect with her estranged foster mother, finds out something about family and true love. She ends up falling in love with Van. It's really a good love story about two people who really don't want to be in love, but it's kind of forced on them. It's a situation that neither one of them want to have that experience of being vulnerable or in love. This movie is great. It's an enjoyable romance with relatable characters that made it easy for me to get into the story. There were even random bits of comedy, so it's enjoyable. The book is even better.
