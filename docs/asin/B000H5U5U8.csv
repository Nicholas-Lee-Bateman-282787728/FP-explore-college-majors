I think the most striking thing about these little episodes (having spent most of my life in schools, counselling and psychology) is how openly affectionate this family is with each other without ever crossing the ""ugh"" line.  It is encouraging.  I once heard that there are basically two reasons that people watch a TV show: 1.) They'd like to hang out with the people in the show.  2.)  They become emotionally attached to one or more of the characters and want to see what happens next.  This has both.

1009848,A1BMQA5PIZKU1P,B000H5U5U8,"Bryan ""Dragonboots""","[13, 15]","Gene Simmons, by his own admission, is delusional and a workaholic.  What makes the show interesting is that it's sad and admirable at the exact same time.  Admirable once you understand how he grew up and how his being raised in a poor one parent household in Israel had an affect on him(in the episode ""Shrink Wrapped"") and sad because you see his family get dissapointed over and over because they want to do things with him but he chooses to leave his West coast home for various business meetings, sometimes on the East coast(he missed his daughter's soccer game in one episode).  You will see his family roll their eyes or walk off while he's in mid sentence talking about something business related that only he cares about.  There are occasional touching moments also: Gene putting on his makeup and his dauaghter brings him a popsicle and she asks him to put the makeup on her.  From watching this show, it would seem he would be much worse if he did not have his family to keep him grounded and keep his swelled head from floating into the sky and damaging satellites in space.  I liked 'The Osbournes', and have been a HUGE fan of both musicians for years and years so I'm not necessarily slamming either of them -they've got a ton of money from me over 25+ years. lol-, but Family Jewels is a lot easier to watch versus 'The Osbournes' because Simmons and family seem to be a little bit more NORMAL and the viewer does not have to hear a censored beep about every 10 seconds and everyone, in general, seems to be a bit more grounded and not so quick to fly off the handle at any given moment(there's no Kelly Osbourne in Gene's show. lol).  Sophie, Gene's 13yo daughter, makes a joke about 'The Osbournes' when Gene jokingly yells at Shannon inside a snowboard store and calls her ""Sharon Tweek"" to which Sophie replies ""Wrong Show.""  Obviously, Gene did this show for money, along with his whole ""I Am Indy"" car racing thing-which is odd since Gene never drove a car until he was 34yo(you will understand when you watch just ONE episode.  ANY episode about how money plays a big part in every decision he makes) but what he has done in the process is demystify his 'Demon' image that has followed him for 30+ years, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  One episode he spends the entire day with a fan who won a radio contest and it's quite interesting.  I never thought I'd see 'The Demon' playing mini golf and riding around in bumper boats and go karts.  He was really nice to this fan despite what I've read from fan letters on his website who seemed to judge everything on a 22-minute episode when Gene spent what looked like at least 8-10 hours with his 'biggest fan'.  I didn't see the issue at all and remember we only saw roughly 20 minutes of an 8 or 10 hour day with this fan.  This family is funny and there are so many good natured, self depriciating comments in every episode that you can't help but laugh at it all.  Some moments, at least to me, seem to be quite set up just for a 'tv moment', the pregnant or not pregnant final episode and the bull ranch episode titled fittingly 'Loose Change', for example: Gene goes to find out why he lost $20,000 he invested only to end up 'collecting' certain fluids from the Bulls to help increase profit for the ranch and, thus, for himself.  Who does that, what rock star would do that? Isn't $20,000 to Gene about like $2 to the normal everyday person? It just seemed odd among this entire show to me but like one of his kids said, when it comes to business he ""has no off switch"".  The bonus material, adding up to slightly over an hour, is pretty entertaining also and worth a look(although the bloopers weren't as funny as I hoped they'd be).  You get to see more of his KISS office and each family member takes you through it seperately.  Great DVD for any Kiss fan, old or new.  Yes, Nick, us older fans are rolling our walkers into the nearest store to buy this DVD so you can continue to buy cool retro clothes that Jim Morrison or Ian Astbury would be proud of.  Looking forward to season 2 which I have heard will be 20 episodes.  Kiss fans should definetly own this... and don't forget KISSOLOGY on DVD!",5,"Business.  Money.  And, oh yeah.....

He comes across and a pussycat rather than a rock and roll bad boy (although there are some aspects of that part of his life shown here) and as a great partner to Shannon and a fantastic father to the kids.  He's brought them up right and they seem like a genuinely nice family who are respectful, yet still love their fun.Overall this show is hilarious too.  It's fun to be a fly on the wall here.  I have a couple of favourite moments from this season; I love when Shannon and Sophie go to Krav Maga lessons and he goes to pick them up, I love when he does a driving test and I love when he and Shannon go on the weekend retreat and he pays someone in the staff to go get him some real food and a tv.I would have assumed he'd be an arrogant kind of guy for someone of his success, and while he openly admits to how gorgeous he believes himself to be, I found myself really liking him.  I love how they've put family video footage in here too and I love his personality and the relationship he has with his family.  Even if you aren't a Kiss fan, you should check this out because it's a brilliant reality show that gets you hooked right from the start.

I love pets who love their toys.This reality show revolves around the Simmons family (Gene Simmons of Kiss.)  Gene is un-married to an ex-playboy model, who has a twin sister.  Hmm, rock star and playboy model?  Despite the cliche,  their relationship seems genuine.It's refreshing to watch a reality show without the drugs and alcohol whining you usually come across in this genre.  (Watching privileged people wasting away their lives doesn't rouse my sympathy.)I watch this show on the A&E; channel.  In one episode, there was some kind of date auction for charity.  Gene Simmons sent his son Nick to stand in for his ""date"".The date turned out to be a young girl's roller skating rink birthday party.  The group of girls looked about 10 or 11.Nick Simmons was such a good sport about the whole thing, my heart went out to him.It feels kinda freakish to watch someone else's life on TV.

Starring the greatest rockstar/entreprenuer=GENE SIMMONS!!Even though Gene and family are millionaires, they seem so grounded and like a normal family.  Maybe it's becuase they all live honestly and don't put on fronts.  Gene and Shannon seem very open with their kids and you can really feel a great love between them all.  Maybe NOT getting married is the key to true happiness!!! Seriously, you can see why  Gene & Ms. Tweed seem content in thier 20 plus year relationship=they don't get jealous over each other, they talk openly and trust each other.  Something that is VERY RARE in relationships today.  They also treat their children with respect and as equals, and you can see it certainly has benefited them. They are very well-rounded young poeple who are polite and smart.I've been a KISS fan since I was 4 (i'm 33 now) and knew Gene and the boys were great musicians, entertainers and business poeple.  But Gene is THE MASTER! He is a great inspiration, pure example of the american dream and really does have a heart.  Since KISS has whined down in the last couple of years, Gene has taken on great non-kiss business ventures and has been successful with many=author of 2 books, lectures dvd, solo album, INDY and now, Family Jewels.Now more about this product: Packaging is cool, BUT!! after opening the flap of the plastic box to get to the phot album/dvd case=it snapped right off and I had to fix it with tape...I wish they would have but this in a cardboard box with a clear window instead of the plastic box, cuase, again, it broke after only being opened 3 times!!The photo album case is top quality. cool idea for this dvd set.  It was worth the $$$ for this (to me) becuase it came with the A&E; Biography and a two song cd that previews the long awaited 100 song Gene box set, which should be awesome!!! And, of course, the season one of this show is just great.  Just seeing gene day to day at home with the family and seeing him work on new projects and the ideas he comes up with is great!! I LLOOVVEE his office with all the cool KISS stuff.  Wierd thing about it, though, no Paul Stanley.  We see Tommy Thayer at the house and I see old clips of Eric Singer from the Revenge days and that's it.  Could it be true that Paul & Gene really are just strictly KISS-Business Partners and nothing more these days?All in all, this is a great show and package.  Even poeple not aware of KISS or are not KISS fans could learn alot from Gene.

his ""Family Jewels"" television show,KISS co-founder Gene lets us see what his life is like,we also get to meet his family and we learn just how much Simmons is a workoholic and how money counts for him.This show reminds a lot of the Osbournes show wich aired a few years ago,its was basicly Ozzy and his crazy family,the concept is pretty much the same for Family Jewels but is totaly different.In the Osbournes there was swearing,bipping,the kids were always fighting and at times you couldn't understand Ozzy well,wheras in Family Jewels its much more of a normal family and its organized better overral.Gene always talks about himself as the rock god,while his family are always making fun of him and they are hilarious and the show is captivating,interresting and shows us how Gene's life is,well on that point its the closest we ever got.I need to point out that Gene and his wife,ex-playmate Shanon Tweed are happily unmarried since 20+ years,and Gene true to his reputation(he claims to have slept with 4 600 womens).His two kids Nick and Sophie do great on the show as well,in fact even the dog gets his shining moments!I have to say I don't and never really liked reality t.v but I,just like many others love this show!You first have to understand that everything in Gene's life is and pretty much always was about money.In fact the primary reason he did this is to get money,god knows he doesn't really need any more but he still does.Yet I knew that when I was watching it and I still tought he managed to give fans and non-fans their money's worth with this show.These 13 episodes turned out to be some of the best television I ever saw and some of the funniest too!Being a KISS fan I was instantly attracted by it but I soon realized that much more people were watching this,even non-KISS fans have been attracted by it.This show is good at something,1)making you laugh and entertain you and 2)make you discover what its like to be Gene Simmons.Gene is always about money and his family makes fun of him for that,calling him a workoholic and laughing at his god status making him look like not much in the end.Gene was never humble,always giving himself extra credit for founding KISS and his family are the only ones who can keep him grounded because of his huge ego.This show probably wouldn't work if it was about Paul Stanley,Ace Frehley or Peter Criss's families as they like their privacy while Gene is the only one of KISS willing to sell his privacy,plus his family really fit well on the small screen and he is a goof,all that makes the show work so well.Gene takes KISS as not a band but a brand and it always has been like that in the band,making big profits and that is a reason why the band didn't get the respect it deserved.In this show he tries to sell KISS to everyone,trying to make snowboards,his association with Indy Racing and he even tries to make a Gene Simmons's Sexercice video.There is also the episode where he wants to make money with Bull sperm!His daughter Sophie even parodies him saying ""Gene Simmons eggs!I have to call Angus!Hey Angus think about it Gene Simmons eggs..."".Nick then adds still making fun of Gene ""Think about it,my face on a chicken's butt!"".That's just to prove you how the guy is addicted to money.This season might be the first but it already feels like a classic as each episodes are great and I watched each a good dozen times on televison and still enjoy watching them.There is an episode where Gene tries to go on a vacation with his family but he can't resist an opportunity to make money.I liked the episode when he has a radio contest to determine who his biggest fan is,Gene is not really thrilled with the choice and it turns out to be pretty funny.In an episode Nick tries to get a gig with his band and his father books him one.It was nice to hear Nick sing.Each episode has a different plot and it makes sense and seems believable,at least not too phony.Im not sure if this is improvised or what but its certainly great!On this show Gene is not really the rock star,he's mostly the buisness man.I thank Gene for letting us enter his private life and discover more of his personna.The show turned out to be very succesfull on the channel it airs on,A&E; quickly gave another contract for another season because of its high ratings and it became one of the most watched show on the network.I just loved the show and this DVD set of the first season and it has some great bonus features like the couch interviews,the bloopers are good,I particularly enjoyed the ""Inside The lair"" bonus wich took us in Gene's office.Gene's History Of Rock'N'Roll was neat as well.The lost songs is the big surprise and i don't want to spoil it sorry!There are lots of features all listed in the description and the thirteen episodes(its pretty much what each show are allowed for a first season)that accompany them makes this a killer worthy set.The price of the set in most stores is pretty cheap for these kinds of set and I highly recommend them to KISS fans,even if you aren't a fan you will probably like this show as well you don't neccesarily need to be a fan to appreciate it.The highest rating obviously five stars.",5,"""It's Good To Be Me""-Gene Simmons",1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,5320,"['do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'much', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'KISS', 'Gene',
