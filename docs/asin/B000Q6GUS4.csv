Needless to say I LOVE Harm Rabb, he couldn't be any cuter. Season two brought Catherine Bell on the scene as Harm's Partner. I love the immediate chemistry between them and the looks Harm gives her...my heart swoons. The love is there for sure now but they cannot act on it.I didn't think it would keep getting better and better but what can I say it does. Season 4 is no dissapointment. I love how it is current with the year it was made as far as what wars are going on.I think watching this also makes us remember our troops more and all they are doing for us. We can sit and enjoy watching DVD's safe in our homes because they are protecting and defending our freedom.The adventures are so varied and different in each show. Season two has more courtroom time it's investigations and drama.I cannot say enough good about this show.

No dirty or inappropriate  scenes are not used in the show and great for any family members can view.  It tells the stories that always seem to be stood by the basic principles of human kind and also shows humanity in every day functions.It shows  much of what the military people may have to go through within political limitations and its incompetency.  I believe those environment will be always there.  This also shows how critical it is for the American people to elect the best people possible for our leaders.  It makes the viewers to wonder how much truths are set aside when decisions are made by our leaders in this country.The tools in the show may get outdated but what the creator wants to tell the viewers will always be refreshing.It has great casts and the leading man (David James Elliot) is the perfect man to play the role, hansom, great voice, and great acting)  He also pays very close attention to the detail in his role.  After you see the show a movie such as 'Top Gun' looks very tinny.  Tom Cruise does not even come close in his role next to David J Elliot.
