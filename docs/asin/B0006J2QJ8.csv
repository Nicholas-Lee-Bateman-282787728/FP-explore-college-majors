870527,A303DSLSUYUG42,B0006J2QJ8,Jane Adams,"[1, 1]","My husband introduced me to Anne of Green Gables after we were married...his sisters made him watch it over and over growing up. I loved it! I then remembered my Grandma watching a show called Avonlea when I was a kid, I never sat down and watched it with her...but after seeing the Anne movies I had to give them a try. When I saw how much they were I decided to rent some first. We rented season 1 and 2 and my kids (2, 4, and 6 at the time) and I loved them! I love all the RTA seasons even more than Little House. We own all but one of the seasons now...but we will get it next month! I watch these over and over with my kids, my five year old son even loves them. He thinks Felix and Gus are so cool! I would say from a conservative Christian perspective that there were a few episodes (out of all the seasons combined not out of each one) that I wont show my young children until they are older. I just put a sticky note on the outside of the case to remind myself which one I don't want them to watch. Some episodes in this series the children are quite naughty, but it makes for good discussions with my children afterwards. Sometimes Amazon's price is good...sometimes not. Season 1,4, and 6 I bought from Amazon but Season 3 and 5 I found a better deal on ebay.. I bought the HD ones and mine are great quality...I hate the case though, I put mine into clear DVD cases of my own because I felt like I was going to scratch them taking them in and out of what they came in.

870535,A1BVCH82W0M2W2,B0006J2QJ8,"Paul Tognetti ""The real world is so much more...","[0, 0]","My wife and I got hooked on ""Avonlea"" during its initial run on The Disney Channel in the early 1990's.  As I recall we were both very pleased to find a show devoid of all of the double entendre and sexual innuendo that was becoming so prevalant on prime time television in those days. Well here we are nearly two decades later and network and cable TV continues to sink to new lows.  My wife and I simply don't watch it.  As an alternative we have built our own library of classic motion pictures and quality television shows.  Recently we purchased the four disc set ""Road To Avonlea: The Complete Fourth Season"".  Much to our delight we discovered that we had never even seen the overwhelming majority of the 13 episodes included in this set.In Season Four we are introduced to Clive Pettibone, the new schoolteacher brought to Avonlea to replace the retiring Hetty King.  Pettibone is a retired military man who brings a rather stern demeanor to his new position. At the beginning it is unclear whether the children of Avonlea will ever be able to adjust to his rather authoritarian style of teaching.  Season Four also follows the blossoming romance between Felicity King and Gus Pike.  There are numerous twists and turns along the way and it seems that teenage angst is on display all season long.  Meanwhile, a number of this season's episodes revolve around the White Sands Hotel where young Felix King gets his first job and Aunt Hetty decides to become an investor much to the chagrin of proprietor Simon Tremaine. To date I have seen 12 of the 13 episodes and I am pleased to report that each and every one of them is of the very highest quality. Again. most of these episodes were new to us.  I particularly enjoyed an episode called ""Evelyn"" where a schoolboy chum of Alex King returns to Avonlea with his young wife and is killed in a tragic accident.  This episode is very poignant and is sure to bring a tear to your eye.  My favorite episode of the season is called ""The Dinner"" and I recommend it to you wholeheartedly.  This just might be the best episode I have seen in this series thus far.In ""Road To Avonlea:  The Complete Fourth Season"" Executive Producer Kevin Sullivan has given us around 600 minutes of the highest quality television you are ever going to find.  The photography is simply stunning and the writing top-drawer.  Meanwhile, a word of praise to Anne Tait, the person responsible for casting this show.  The largely Canadian-born actors and actresses who make up the cast prove to be a diverse and incredibly talented group with the ability to evoke the full range of emotions from their audience.  After viewing ""Road To Avonlea:  The Complete Fourth Season"" my wife and I are bound and determined to own the entire series.  In fact, we have already purchased seasons three and five.  ""Road To Avonlea"" is that rare TV show that can be enjoyed by the entire family. If you are looking for quality entertainment for your family look no further.  It simply does not get any better than this.

Seasons 1-6 are excellent.Beautiful scenery, farm, horses, period costumes and sets, pretty dresses, realistic characters, likeable characters, lively pace, some humor, and inviting activities, take you to a nicer place.The episode, ""The Lady and the Blade"" (writer: Deborah Nathan) introduces interesting new characters: the new school teacher, Colonel Clive Pettibone, and his stand-at-attention children. Clive and Hetty are aspiring daring-adventure & dramatic-romance novelists.The episode ""Hearts and Flowers"" (writer Hart Hanson) has Chef Pierre La Pierre's truly French niece coming to visit from her convent school and becoming infatuated with a completely innocent (Goose Pike) Gus, to the jealously of Felicity.This season has my favorite episode, ""The Dinner"", the romance of Gus and Felicity. Felicity desires to be courted by Gus, without the teasing of the other children. If they can only talk alone. The very end is so subtle, yet so funny, a brilliant ending; (written by Heather Conkie).Mr. Sullivan spared no expense to create a variety of warm and humorous escapades.This series has been my best money value; dividing the 13-episodes by the cost: $5113 episodes = $3.92 per 46-minute episode.
