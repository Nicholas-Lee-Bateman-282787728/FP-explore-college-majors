81422,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0788814907,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 5]","Obviously you want to like `Holy Man'.  It stars Eddie Murphy, one of Hollywood's funniest working comedians, and his name alone should warrant honest laughs.  Sadly `Holy Man' fails to deliver the goods on just about every level.I remember laughing out loud once when I saw this movie in the theater, and when I watched this debacle again the other night that outward expression of enjoyment was turned inward and remained one of those thoughts, you know the ones, the `oh that was kinda funny' thought that never goes anywhere but your mind.  `Holy Man' could have been a brilliantly crafted satire but instead it becomes a joke, but not the funny kind; more like a painfully unfunny joke that leaves the audience uncomfortably frustrated.So `Holy Man' stars Murphy as G, a religious eccentric who is making his way to his pilgrimage when he is traumatized by Ricky Hayman who accidentally almost runs G over.  Feeling somewhat guilty, and feeling pressure from his would-be girlfriend Kate, Ricky offers G his home until he is well enough to continue his journey.  The kicker is that Ricky is the producer of a home-shopping network that is dropping in points and his new boss is breathing down his neck to either increase ratings or look for another job.  Kate, who happens to be the shows marketer, realizes (after G makes an unexpected appearance on the show) that G may be the answer to their prayers.  Soon G becomes the new host with the most as his eccentric forms of enlightenment draw in viewers and sell, sell, sell.As far as acting is concerned, Murphy is good but he is not all that funny.  He really could have taken G to a whole other level but he kept him lowbrow and somewhat boring.  He had a few chuckle worthy scenes but the overall film is so painfully underwhelming you can't bring yourself to acknowledge the chuckle.  Jeff Goldblum never ceases to annoy me; well he ceases on occasion but as a rule he is generally the worst part of a specific movie.  I give him points for actually staying within my tolerance is this film.  His neurotic tendencies seem to be a little more tempered and controlled and thus he becomes a little more accessible and so I give him props there.  It's a shame that he decided to make this the movie he matured in.  Kelly Presley is a throwaway character here, serving her purpose of clich&eacute;d romantic lead and moral compass.Blah, blah, blah.In fact the only actor that kept me interested was Robert Loggia who plays Hayman's boss McBainbridge (a stark contrast from his delightful boss in `Big').  I just like Loggia I think so maybe I was blinded to the clich&eacute; ridden character he was playing.  Oh well, at least he wasn't boring.In the end I would pass on this mess if I were you.  There are so many better comedies out there, even one's that star Murphy, that to waste your time and energy trying to find a laugh amidst this poor excuse for commercial success is just a crime against your better judgment.  I should have let me memory of disappointment guide me far away from ever watching this film again.  Next time; well, hopefully there won't be a next time.",1,An unholy disaster...,1213833600,"06 19, 2008",2008,3133,"['Obviously', 'want', 'like', 'Holy', 'Man', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'funniest', 'working', 'comedians', 'name', 'alone', 'should', 'warrant', 'honest', 'laughs', 'Sadly', 'Holy', 'Man', 'fails', 'deliver', 'goods', 'just', 'level.I', 'remember', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'once', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'when', 'watched', 'debacle', 'again', 'other', 'night', 'expression', 'enjoyment', 'was', 'turned', 'inward', 'remained', 'one', 'thoughts', 'know', 'ones', 'oh', 'was', 'kinda', 'funny', 'thought', 'never', 'anywhere', 'mind', 'Holy', 'Man', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', 'satire', 'instead', 'joke', 'not', 'funny', 'kind', 'more', 'painfully', 'unfunny', 'joke', 'audience', 'uncomfortably', 'frustrated.So', 'Holy', 'Man', 'stars', 'Murphy', 'G', 'religious', 'eccentric', 'who', 'making', 'way', 'pilgrimage', 'when', 'traumatized', 'Ricky', 'Hayman', 'who', 'accidentally', 'almost', 'G', 'Feeling', 'somewhat', 'guilty', 'feeling', 'pressure', 'would-be', 'girlfriend', 'Kate', 'Ricky', 'G', 'home', 'well', 'enough', 'continue', 'journey', 'kicker', 'Ricky', 'producer', 'home-shopping', 'network', 'dropping', 'points', 'new', 'boss', 'breathing', 'down', 'neck', 'increase', 'ratings', 'look', 'job', 'Kate', 'who', 'be', 'shows', 'marketer', 'realizes', 'G', 'unexpected', 'appearance', 'show', 'G', 'may', 'be', 'answer', 'prayers', 'Soon', 'G', 'new', 'host', 'most', 'eccentric', 'forms', 'enlightenment', 'draw', 'viewers', 'sell', 'sell', 'sell.As', 'far', 'acting', 'concerned', 'Murphy', 'good', 'not', 'funny', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'G', 'whole', 'other', 'level', 'kept', 'lowbrow', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'had', 'few', 'chuckle', 'worthy', 'scenes', 'overall', 'film', 'so', 'painfully', 'underwhelming', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'acknowledge', 'chuckle', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'never', 'annoy', 'well', 'occasion', 'rule', 'generally', 'worst', 'part', 'specific', 'movie', 'give', 'points', 'actually', 'staying', 'tolerance', 'film', 'neurotic', 'tendencies', 'seem', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'tempered', 'controlled', 'thus', 'little', 'more', 'accessible', 'so', 'give', 'props', 'there', 'shame', 'decided', 'make', 'movie', 'matured', 'Kelly', 'Presley', 'throwaway', 'character', 'here', 'serving', 'purpose', 'clich', 'eacute', 'romantic', 'lead', 'moral', 'compass.Blah', 'blah', 'blah.In', 'fact', 'only', 'actor', 'kept', 'interested', 'was', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'who', 'Hayman', 'boss', 'McBainbridge', 'stark', 'contrast', 'delightful', 'boss', 'Big', 'just', 'Loggia', 'think', 'so', 'maybe', 'was', 'blinded', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ridden', 'character', 'was', 'playing', 'Oh', 'well', 'least', 'was', ""n't"", 'boring.In', 'end', 'would', 'pass', 'mess', 'were', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'better', 'comedies', 'there', 'even', 'one', 'star', 'Murphy', 'waste', 'time', 'energy', 'trying', 'find', 'laugh', 'amidst', 'poor', 'excuse', 'commercial', 'success', 'just', 'crime', 'better', 'judgment', 'should', 'have', 'let', 'memory', 'disappointment', 'guide', 'far', 'away', 'ever', 'watching', 'film', 'again', 'Next', 'time', 'well', 'hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'next', 'time']",N/A

After having read many reviews on Holy Man, both here and elsewhere, I've come to the conclusion that this is one of those movies most people just don't get. This is indeed the age of crudity, where shock value is held in higher regard than genuinely good storytelling and uplifting characters. This film succeeds on all fronts by offering itself not just as a hilarious comedy(which it certainly is), but also as a means to convey a message that's too often ingnored and scoffed at. Let's face it, most people today are master cynics, unwilling to accept any positivity but always ready to rebuke something. It seems to me, that's why this film was not a comercial success.Eddie Murphy has created a phenomenal character in G and plays him with enough love and abandon I found myself smiling all the way through. Forget wondering exactly who G is. If you're really spending time on that, you've failed to see the point of the story. Besides, some things are best left to the imagination. Ambiguity doesn't have to be a scary concept.The love story between Goldblum and Preston isn't perfect, but their performances-particuarly Goldblum's-are worth seeing. All in all, my only complaint is that their aren't any special features to speak of and letterbox format stinks. Otherwise, let go of yourself and rent this wonderful film.

I like Eddie Murphy because he seems so realistic, and because he has a knack for going over the top. Seems like a good pair right? Well, it does work when  the two are interacting. The problem is the reality falls right out the  bottom. I couldn't help but think, there's no way this guy is denegrating  consumerism on a QVC-like channel and people are buying things. It just  doesn't make any sense. If people are truly captivated by his guruesque  preachings, then why would they pick up the phone to talk to an operator  and buy something? It totally contradicts what he is saying. Other than  that I thought all the players were effective, especially Goldblum. Murphy  is quite restrained because of the nature of this character. This isn't  really a comedy. You can tell that they tried to make things funny that  weren't, like Goldblum playing charades for someone making a false  telephone call. It isn't funny because the one making the call is telling  &quot;G&quot; that he is dying, or at least in very ill health. This film  tries to be a comedy, but I think it fails in that department.

It is a story of a man on a journey of just doing good in the world & making people feel better for even just a little while. It got a PG rating because well, it's Eddie Murphy & he uses the name of a body part in the movie. Other than that it's a clean good hearted enjoyable movie that let's you remember how we should treat one another. Good job Eddie. Just to FYI the word he says is also said by a little boy in Kindergarten Cop.

81440,AVVXC6B1O3CLU,0788814907,Milkyway Movie Lover,"[1, 1]","I'm writting this review for one simple reason, I was astounded to see it has a measly 3 star rating.  Thats totally absurd.  Its a definite 4 star movie and that's only because I only give 5 stars to the most incredible flicks.  I'm giving 5 here because of all the idiots who slandered this really entertaining movie.  One key thing that makes a movie a 4 or 5 star movie to me is if it is rewatchable or not.  I've seen this one about 5 times and enjoy it a lot.  The key here is Eddie Murphy is so talented, he has more than enough depth to do so well in parts like this where he isnt trying to crack you up by being a total baffoon, but rather he's entertaining you with a great character, made so believeable.  It's amazing how well he does playing multiple characters in other movies, something few can do any better than he does.  But some shallow minds can't seem to realize this is called talent.  some people have a lot of it, like Steve Martin for example.  He makes a great movie like ""Shopgirl"" and doesnt have to be a funny man throughout the movie, he is enjoyable just because he is versatile, and TALENTED. ofcourse Clair Danes is a show stealer and truly deserves being the center of the movie and boy does she ever play it perfectly,, maybe I should go leave a review for that one too if it isn't already rated at 5 stars.  anyway, to make one last point here, this is a movie you add to your collection if you enjoy pure entertainment and love to watch fun unique movies.  If you are a one track mind kind of person, just slander the movie like all the other small minds seem to be doing, but to intelligent people everywhere, this is a fun movie worth buying, and watching many times to come!

A marketing consultant (Kelly Preston) and Ricky end up meeting a very unusual person named G (Eddie Murphy) who just might be able to help them.G is earthy, philosophical, mystical and non-materialistic.  He is a man on a spiritual quest but because is willing to help others he agrees to become a shopping channel celebrity.  Along the way, G teaches Ricky, as well as the shoppers, a few things about living a more fulfilling life.  Ricky and G are an odd match and their interactions are funny.With its great acting and an amusing story ""Holy Man"" should appeal to most audiences.
