I went home and tried to pull it out to watch it again and couldn't find it.  I don't know if I loaned it to someone who never gave it back or if I somehow misplaced it.  But I immediately got onto Amazon to order another copy.  That's how good this movie is.  It's bizarre, it's over the top, it's wildly funny, and it's incredibly touching.  When I received it it in the mail, I was excited and watched it that night - it was actually the FOURTH time I've seen this movie.

767764,A23BTLTIHMJN01,B0000ARD7O,A. Simon,"[2, 5]","I have lost two hours of my life watching this tripe.This film combines two genres, each of which is an utter waste of time. One genre is The Neurotic trying to find meaning in his/her life, which usually involves going on a journey, or if you wish, an escape. The problem with this genre is that most of the people in the audience aren't neurotic, so they cannot identify with someone who cannot dislodge their head out of their ass in order to straighten out their life, and so feel no sympathy. The other genre is The Fag movie, whereing a homosexual is keeping his sex life under wraps and at some point reveals himself as being gay, whereupon everyone in the movie, and presumably the audience, is supposed to stand up and cheer, as if being gay in itself was some sort of major accomplishment. Again, if you're not gay, this type of movie just doesn't connect. If you want to call me homophobic because of this, go right ahead.Now, as to the movie plot: an international singer, who is adored by millions of women goes to Chicago and is found dead. A frumpy housewife who worships the singer is devastated, compounded by the fact that her husband just then left her. She goes to England on an impulse to the singer's home and meets the singer's gay lover. Two thirds of the movie later, they decide to return to Chicago to track down the killer. Believe me, it is much worse than it sounds; there are only ten minutes of the movie where it stops being boring and that is when they find the killer.Do yourself a favor and avoid this tripe.",1,BORING,1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,1544,"['have', 'lost', 'two', 'hours', 'life', 'watching', 'tripe.This', 'film', 'combines', 'two', 'genres', 'utter', 'waste', 'time', 'One', 'genre', 'Neurotic', 'trying', 'find', 'meaning', 'his/her', 'life', 'usually', 'going', 'journey', 'wish', 'escape', 'problem', 'genre', 'most', 'people', 'audience', 'are', ""n't"", 'neurotic', 'can', 'not', 'identify', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'dislodge', 'head', 'ass', 'order', 'straighten', 'out', 'life', 'so', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'other', 'genre', 'Fag', 'movie', 'whereing', 'homosexual', 'keeping', 'sex', 'life', 'wraps', 'point', 'reveals', 'being', 'gay', 'whereupon', 'everyone', 'movie', 'presumably', 'audience', 'supposed', 'stand', 'up', 'cheer', 'being', 'gay', 'was', 'sort', 'major', 'accomplishment', 'Again', ""'re"", 'not', 'gay', 'type', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'connect', 'want', 'call', 'homophobic', 'go', 'right', 'ahead.Now', 'movie', 'plot', 'international', 'singer', 'who', 'adored', 'millions', 'women', 'Chicago', 'found', 'dead', 'frumpy', 'housewife', 'who', 'singer', 'devastated', 'compounded', 'fact', 'husband', 'just', 'then', 'left', 'England', 'impulse', 'singer', 'home', 'singer', 'gay', 'lover', 'Two', 'thirds', 'movie', 'later', 'decide', 'return', 'Chicago', 'track', 'down', 'killer', 'Believe', 'much', 'worse', 'are', 'only', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'where', 'being', 'boring', 'when', 'find', 'killer.Do', 'favor', 'avoid', 'tripe']",N/A
767765,AORW1FRF4D4KS,B0000ARD7O,azindn,"[6, 6]","This little film is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gays, straights, dwarfs, British tea and pubs, American gun culture, divorce and marriage; yet, it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each. Kathy Bates is ""Amazing"" Grace Beasley, and as a character actor of staggering range, she brings her considerable comedic talent to ground this somewhat unusual film as she did in Fried Green Tomatos. With the help of other comedic talents like Dan Akroid as Max, her ex-lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown Chicago and rural England, the story is just intriguing enough to entertain. Jonathan Price plays Victor Fox, a closet gay singer murdered by a cross-bow killer in Chicago. His valet-lover Dirk Simpson, played by the stunning Rupert Everett, must overcome Victor's siblings, including Lynn Redgrave, who want to turn their home into a tribute museum, and teams with Bates and her dwarf daughter-in-law, Maudy Beasley, to find the killer among the homeless of Chicago.The entire cast sing at various points in the pursuit, and are excellent, esp. the talented Price and Bates. This implausible storyline, both funny and bizarre, is one of the most off-center films. Cameos by Julie Andrews, Barry Manlow, and Sally Jesse Raphael should tell you just how bizarre this film truly is.

The studios must have had a terrible time marketing it.  Most of the characters are over 30.  It's got lots of comedy and some drama.  And, heavens, there's a gay character!  It's no wonder the marketing department gave up, but it's too bad they did.This movie shifts gears more often than a Geo Metro in the mountains.  And it works, without being jarring.  ""Unconditional Love"" can go from drama to the height of absurdity in five seconds.  It starts out dramatic, with a tone different from the remainder of the movie, not unlike ""Joe Versus the Volcano.""  But shortly after, the comedy begins.  There are some funny, funny bits in here.  ""Unconditional Love"" is also one of the more original things I've seen for a while, with a script that wasn't just cut and pasted in ""Final Draft,"" and interesting casting and direction.Meredith Eaton, the little person who plays Maudey, Kathy Bates' daughter-in-law, is fantastic, and steals every scene she's in.

Before I came over I heard her relay the brief synopsis of the film over the phone and I was expecting a ridiculous yarn filled with ridiculous characters.  It has all that, but it is more often than not surprisingly entertaining.  Kathy Bates is the brightest star here and she portrays her ""homemaker"" character with great subtelty and depth, making her instantly likeable.  Rupert Everett shows up about a third of the way into the film and is just one of the many character actors in this film that shine upon arrival.  The major flaws appear when the viewer starts thinking too much.  In fact, sometimes thinking at all will ruin a scene.  For instance(s), there are some great moments when characters break out in song.  Even though the scene calls for singing to occur it is still very refreshing amid all the crazy and far-fetched plotting circling around.  Kathy Bates sings!

Once the film begins and it is apparent that the director is P.J. Hogan who has created such fun and sensitive stories as MURIEL'S WEDDING and MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING, then the gentle humor and touching messages are welcome and anticipated.  With a cast that includes sterling performances by the always excellent Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Jonathan Pryce, and Lynn Redgrave,  the impact is one of polished comedy and sincere pathos blended as well as Hogan has done in the past.  Hogan likes to touch on issues such as 'different' people, be those differences as in gender identity, physical stature ( small person Meredith Eaton is a beautiful and gifted actress), or social mores.  Briefly, Kathy Bates plays a housewife who fantasizes an affair with a popular British singer (Jonathan Pryce - who not only acts well but is given the opprtunity to share his significant vocal talents in person and on the soundtrack of the film).  Her husband of 25 years (Dan Ackroyd) announces to her that their marriage is over because Bates is boring.  That same day her idol is killed and she decides to go to England for the funeral!  Once there she intrudes into the house of her fantasy man only to discover that he was gay and has a lover of 10 years (Rupert Everett) who is being ostracized by the singers' family.  Persistance and happenstance throw these two together and the resultant bi-continental declaration for revenge of the death of their shared hero (with a lot of help form Bates' daughter-in-law Meredith Eaton) forms the bulk of the tale.  Along the way they encounter the real life Julie Andrews, Sally Jessy Raphael, and Barry Manilow in what could have been a pushed overindulgence, but Hogan keeps the tempo down so that these guests appearances maintain the jolly mood of this fluffy but warmly entertaining movie.

AND Barry Manilow joining the cast for the finale's showstopper?  It may all seem mushy, maudlin and over the top, and it is!  But this little gem is a delightfully entertaining movie, full of smashingly good performances.  Oscar winner Kathy Bates shines as Grace Beasley, a housewife with a dream of becoming a singer, a husband who leaves her after 25 years and a trip to England for the funeral of her murdered singing idol, Victor Fox.  Bates hits all the right notes and is utterly charming.Rupert Everett as the singer's unknown lover is at first all brutish and loutish, but once we learn a little more about him, he becomes the film's ironic hero.  Everett is very good in this role.Dan Aykroyd plays Bates' husband with all the timidity and self-serving bravado that explains the lack of adventure in their lives.Jack Noseworthy, a very underrated young actor, portrays their son, who has also left his wife (we'll get to her later!).Peter Skaasgard (Shattered Glass) plays the window washer with a secret.  His youthful innocence is appropriately fitting.Lynn Redgrave and Stephanie Beacham are remarkable as Victor's obnoxious and grabbing sisters.  Their scenes are few, but they are brilliant!!Jonathan Pryce (who got his start in Miss Saigon) is wonderful as the Tom Jones/Elvis Presley clone, whose murder leads Bates and Everett to find his killer--the Crossbow Killer.The movie belongs, however, to the delightful Meredith Eaton, who plays Bates' daughter-in-law.  Eaton is a dwarf (really) and she has a beautiful face and is so full of energy and oomph she lights up the screen.  Her take off on the red-raincoated dwarf from 'DOn't Look Now&quot; is absolutely hilarious.

And it's certainly worth saving. Nobody does the ""awakening matron"" like Kathy Bates (see ""Fried Green Tomatoes""), and her Grace Beasley is a delight as she finds her backbone and her voice. She needs it. Her daughter-in-law (Meredith Eaton) is an acid-tongued dwarf with no inhibitions, and Dan Ackroyd is the wettest blanket this side of the Johnstown flood. After being dumped by her husband, patronized by her son, and deprived of her grandson, Grace has no choice but to look after herself. Grace goes to England to attend the funeral of her idol - Jonathan Pryce in fine voice and having the time of his life - and meets his gay lover, Rupert Everett. After swallowing her shock, the unlikely pair returns to Chicago to track down Pryce's  murderer. The performances are all fine, the pace is feathery, the music easy on the ear...It's all whimsical and preposterous, and the kind of movie that will have you laughing out loud when you're sitting home alone...The ultimate test of a comedy.

Hogan's (Muriel's Wedding) follow-up to ""My Best Friend's Wedding,"" it comes obvious as why ""Unconditional Love"" fell from general release before eventually debuting on cable. This uneven yet unpredictable romantic comedy features an all-star ensemble cast and lots of queer fun. On the same day her stodgy husband Max (a rather one-dimensional Dan Aykroyd) announces he wants a divorce, Grace's (Kathy Bates) favorite singer, Victor Fox (a sequin-suit clad Jonathan Pryce), is murdered. Doubly distraught, the frumpy, middle-aged Grace throws caution to the wind and travels to England for Fox's funeral. There she discovers that her idol, whose reputation was that of a captivating loverman (think Tom Jones crossed with Liberace), was gay after she meets his lover, Dirk Simpson (Rupert Everett). After forming an alliance against Fox's upper crust family, who would like to suppress news of Fox's homosexuality, the pair decide to return to Chicago and bring Fox's killer to justice.Bates does well as a bored/boring housewife who has apparently never held a job. The apartment Grace shared with Max on South Wacker Drive in Chicago reeks of money and no particular taste. When her husband leaves her for some excitement, Grace takes this as her ticket out of her humdrum life. With musical numbers on an airplane, in the area under a roadway where the homeless live and almost everywhere else, ""Unconditional Love"" is entertaining. Jonathan Pryce not only sings rather well, he's wearing a blue sequined suit in his role as the dead pop singer who looks down on the events unfolding. The ensemble cast includes cameos from Julie Andrews (who sings ""Getting to Know You"" twice in the film) and Barry Manilow, Sally Jesse Raphael and a scene-stealing Meredith Eaton as Grace's dwarf daughter-in-law.",3,I can't smile without you....,1184025600,"07 10, 2007",2007,1842,"['had', 'wait', 'six', 'years', 'P.J', 'Hogan', 'Muriel', 'Wedding', 'follow-up', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'obvious', 'why', 'Unconditional', 'Love', 'fell', 'general', 'release', 'eventually', 'debuting', 'cable', 'uneven', 'yet', 'unpredictable', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'features', 'all-star', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'lots', 'queer', 'fun', 'same', 'day', 'stodgy', 'husband', 'Max', 'rather', 'one-dimensional', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'divorce', 'Grace', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'favorite', 'singer', 'Victor', 'Fox', 'sequin-suit', 'clad', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'murdered', 'Doubly', 'distraught', 'frumpy', 'middle-aged', 'Grace', 'caution', 'wind', 'travels', 'England', 'Fox', 'funeral', 'idol', 'reputation', 'was', 'captivating', 'loverman', 'think', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'crossed', 'Liberace', 'was', 'gay', 'lover', 'Dirk', 'Simpson', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'forming', 'alliance', 'Fox', 'upper', 'crust', 'family', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'suppress', 'news', 'Fox', 'homosexuality', 'pair', 'decide', 'return', 'Chicago', 'bring', 'Fox', 'killer', 'justice.Bates', 'well', 'bored/boring', 'housewife', 'who', 'apparently', 'never', 'held', 'job', 'apartment', 'Grace', 'shared', 'Max', 'South', 'Wacker', 'Drive', 'Chicago', 'reeks', 'money', 'particular', 'taste', 'When', 'husband', 'excitement', 'Grace', 'ticket', 'humdrum', 'life', 'musical', 'numbers', 'airplane', 'area', 'roadway', 'where', 'homeless', 'live', 'almost', 'everywhere', 'else', 'Unconditional', 'Love', 'entertaining', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'not', 'only', 'rather', 'well', 'wearing', 'blue', 'sequined', 'suit', 'role', 'dead', 'pop', 'singer', 'who', 'down', 'events', 'unfolding', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'cameos', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'who', 'Getting', 'Know', 'twice', 'film', 'Barry', 'Manilow', 'Sally', 'Jesse', 'Raphael', 'scene-stealing', 'Meredith', 'Eaton', 'Grace', 'dwarf', 'daughter-in-law']",N/A
