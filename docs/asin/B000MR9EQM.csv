1050137,A3JXPMX8E59PL1,B000MR9EQM,Adam B. Krenn,"[9, 10]","I had never heard of this film and stumbled across it on an ""instant download"" pay viewing site. I have been a RPGer and Wargamer for about 30 years so I thought I would give this a look. I expected a low-budget romp that captured many of the idiosyncrasies and minutia of my hobby much the same way as ""Fellowship of the Dice"" did. I expected to generally like it but nothing too special (as the aforementioned FotD, which I did overall enjoy). When I viewed this I found myself literally laughing my butt off at genuine comedy sequences both RPG specific and humorous in a more generic way. This film had the goods! I was floored! A better comedy than Hollywood has put out in years! Low Budget? Yes. Some hammy and/or poor acting? Yes. Did that detract from my enjoyment of this film? Not in the least. If anything, it added to the flair of realism. Despite its shortcomings most of the acting was actually serviceable or better and one guy ""Brother Silence"" (Played by Brian Lewis) was a stand-out! The comedy writing was tight and even razor-sharp in several instances. I may sound like I'm gushing but I gave it a second watch a few days later, just to be sure. One other thing, the people involved in the making of this film were obviously having a blast and you can tell. Their fun is felt in the viewing. I loved it! Rarely has a movie come from nowhere and made me feel this way and I am thankful to Dead Gentlemen and Matt Vancil. Now I proudly have this film in my collection. It's fun, it's entertaining and it made me feel good!

1050140,A3W3LP0RSWLJCS,B000MR9EQM,Annihilatrix1138,"[3, 3]","Let me first say this: Going into this movie, I was expecting that I would be turning it off ten minutes in. I knew it was an indie movie, and I knew that it was about gaming. Never has a movie been made that accurately portrays gaming - tabletop or otherwise - without being silly or taking everything to the extreme, so I certainly didn't think that this movie would get it right. But let me tell you, I have never been so thankful for being wrong.I've never seen the prequel this movie is loosely based on, but I understand this movie centers around the same premise: Just a bunch of friends playing D&D; and getting their characters into all sorts of awesome predicaments. All of the jokes are terrifyingly accurate, and the whole movie celebrates all that gaming can be. Though everything was made on a very low budget, the filmmakers somehow managed to make a story and characters so absorbing and entertaining that all of the cheesy sets and special effects get lost into the background, until all you want to know is how the adventure will end. And it all does come to an end, sadly, which is really the only negative thing I can say about it; I wanted more!I haven't laughed so hard at a movie all year, and it's been awhile since I've watched something that I immediately wanted to watch again. THE GAMERS: DORKNESS RISING touches on so many aspects of what makes gaming a lifestyle of its own, and does so without compromise or disrespect. If you've ever played an RPG, be it on a console or around your kitchen table, you will love this movie, there can be no question. This is a rare gem that deserves high praise for its laughs, its intelligence, and for being one of the only movies that shines a light on a pass-time that has long since been ignored.",5,A fighter and a bard?

1050142,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B000MR9EQM,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[11, 12]","Dead Gentlemen Productions started life as a bunch of friends goofing around and making zero-budget movies for their own amusement. However, after the success of their first project, Demon Hunters, in 1999 they got slightly more ambitious for their second, The Gamers, which was released in 2002. The Gamers gained a sort-of sequel, Dorkness Rising, released last year, which was a quantum leap forward in quality.By the time the team came to make the sequel, their fortunes had increased. The success of their first two films plus another one in the interim (Demon Hunters: Dead Camper Lake) had led to them being able to put substantially more resources into The Gamers: Dorkness Rising. This time the movie is 90 minutes long and features much larger numbers of actors and extras, as well as considerably more impressive effects, costumes, make-up, sets and locations. Also, whilst references in the first movie to the actual game they were playing were deliberately kept generic, this movie is sponsored by several major companies, allowing real gaming products to be used.This time around the plot is more involved. The dungeon master, Lodge, is trying to write an adventure for official publication, but his party keeps getting killed whilst running it. Power gamer Cass is determined to beat the game no matter what, and the party decides they need two more members to be strong enough to beat the game. Cass' ex, Joanna, joins the group and immediately brings about a change in gameplay, as she is more focused on developing her character then min-maxing her skills. Unable to attract other players (due to the group's 'reputation'), Lodge has an NPC paladin join the party (portrayed as being played by himself during the in-game sequences). The other two players, Gary and Leo, emboldened by the change in group dynamics, decide to play outside their comfort zones, the former by playing a female sorceress and the latter by playing a bard (which attracts howls of derision for the perceived weakness of the bard character class).The campaign gets underway. The party is charged with locating a magical mask that has been stolen by an evil necromancer. Progress is hampered when Lodge and Joanna's favoured tactic of investigating the situation through dialogue and roleplay is interrupted by Gary vapourising everyone in sight with magic and Leo using his high charisma score to sleep with every woman he comes across, whilst Cass attempts to 'roleplay' his monk by making up totally inane 'wise sayings' on the spot:""He who stumbles around in darkness with a stick is blind. But he who sticks out in darkness is...flourescent.""Unlike the first movie, the game in the sequel spans several sessions and there are sections inbetween showing how the change in gaming style is spilling over into the characters' real lives. There's also a hilariously random sequence in which the structural conceit of the film (showing the real-life game and events within the game) is applied to a pirates-and-ninjas board game with interesting results. The writer/director keeps a firm lid on things getting too emo or dramatic however, with the focus remaining firmly on the comedy and the characters. The movie's highlight is probably a sequence near the end featuring a very unique kind of 'undead' creature which may rank among the funniest things I have ever seen on screen (and gives the film a single extra-half star below).The Gamers: Dorkness Rising (****) is a radical improvement on the original, with stronger production values, a more ambitious script and the presence of more professional actors sustaining the longer running length very well.",4,An excellent and very funny movie.,1237852800,"03 24, 2009",2009,3650,"['Dead', 'Gentlemen', 'Productions', 'started', 'life', 'bunch', 'friends', 'goofing', 'around', 'making', 'zero-budget', 'movies', 'own', 'amusement', 'However', 'success', 'first', 'project', 'Demon', 'Hunters', '1999', 'got', 'slightly', 'more', 'ambitious', 'second', 'Gamers', 'was', 'released', '2002', 'Gamers', 'gained', 'sort-of', 'sequel', 'Dorkness', 'Rising', 'released', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'quantum', 'leap', 'forward', 'quality.By', 'time', 'team', 'came', 'make', 'sequel', 'fortunes', 'had', 'increased', 'success', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'one', 'interim', 'Demon', 'Hunters', 'Dead', 'Camper', 'Lake', 'had', 'led', 'being', 'able', 'put', 'substantially', 'more', 'resources', 'Gamers', 'Dorkness', 'Rising', 'time', 'movie', '90', 'minutes', 'long', 'features', 'much', 'larger', 'numbers', 'actors', 'extras', 'as', 'well', 'considerably', 'more', 'impressive', 'effects', 'costumes', 'make-up', 'sets', 'locations', 'Also', 'whilst', 'references', 'first', 'movie', 'actual', 'game', 'were', 'playing', 'were', 'deliberately', 'kept', 'generic', 'movie', 'sponsored', 'several', 'major', 'companies', 'allowing', 'real', 'gaming', 'products', 'be', 'used.This', 'time', 'plot', 'more', 'involved', 'dungeon', 'master', 'Lodge', 'trying', 'write', 'adventure', 'official', 'publication', 'party', 'keeps', 'getting', 'killed', 'whilst', 'running', 'Power', 'gamer', 'Cass', 'determined', 'beat', 'game', 'matter', 'what', 'party', 'need', 'two', 'more', 'members', 'be', 'strong', 'enough', 'beat', 'game', 'Cass', 'ex', 'Joanna', 'group', 'immediately', 'change', 'gameplay', 'more', 'focused', 'developing', 'character', 'then', 'min-maxing', 'skills', 'Unable', 'attract', 'other', 'players', 'due', 'group', ""'reputation"", 'Lodge', 'NPC', 'paladin', 'join', 'party', 'portrayed', 'being', 'played', 'in-game', 'sequences', 'other', 'two', 'players', 'Gary', 'Leo', 'emboldened', 'change', 'group', 'dynamics', 'decide', 'play', 'comfort', 'zones', 'former', 'playing', 'female', 'sorceress', 'latter', 'playing', 'bard', 'howls', 'derision', 'perceived', 'weakness', 'bard', 'character', 'class', '.The', 'campaign', 'underway', 'party', 'charged', 'locating', 'magical', 'mask', 'been', 'stolen', 'evil', 'necromancer', 'Progress', 'hampered', 'when', 'Lodge', 'Joanna', 'favoured', 'tactic', 'investigating', 'situation', 'dialogue', 'roleplay', 'interrupted', 'Gary', 'vapourising', 'everyone', 'sight', 'magic', 'Leo', 'using', 'high', 'charisma', 'score', 'sleep', 'woman', 'whilst', 'Cass', 'attempts', ""'roleplay"", 'monk', 'making', 'up', 'totally', 'inane', 'sayings', 'spot', 'who', 'around', 'darkness', 'stick', 'blind', 'who', 'out', 'darkness', 'flourescent', 'first', 'movie', 'game', 'sequel', 'several', 'sessions', 'are', 'sections', 'inbetween', 'showing', 'how', 'change', 'gaming', 'style', 'spilling', 'characters', 'real', 'lives', 'also', 'hilariously', 'random', 'sequence', 'structural', 'conceit', 'film', 'showing', 'real-life', 'game', 'events', 'game', 'applied', 'pirates-and-ninjas', 'board', 'game', 'interesting', 'results', 'writer/director', 'firm', 'lid', 'things', 'getting', 'too', 'emo', 'dramatic', 'however', 'focus', 'remaining', 'firmly', 'comedy', 'characters', 'movie', 'highlight', 'probably', 'sequence', 'end', 'featuring', 'very', 'unique', 'kind', ""'undead"", 'creature', 'may', 'rank', 'funniest', 'things', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'screen', 'film', 'single', 'extra-half', 'star', '.The', 'Gamers', 'Dorkness', 'Rising', '****', 'radical', 'improvement', 'original', 'stronger', 'production', 'values', 'more', 'ambitious', 'script', 'presence', 'more', 'professional', 'actors', 'sustaining', 'longer', 'running', 'length', 'very', 'well']",The Gamers: Dorkness Rising

I myself watched it several times and it makes me laugh every time.It's also completely unexpected.  These were a bunch of amateurs in the Seattle area with very little money, and they made what is probably the funniest movie I've seen in years.  Certainly the most insightful movie about gaming I've ever seen.  Though I do warn you you definitely have to be into gaming to appreciate it.On the one hand, you find yourself wishing they had more money to do better effects.  On the other hand, you suspect that not only was that not necessary, but a lot of the movie is hilarious precisely because their sets and costumes are so cheesy, and that if they had been better, the movie would have had a certain serious look that might possibly have clashed with the cheap comedy.The only slight put-off I had was that these guys are using 3.5 edition, so it leaves you a bit cold if you don't know what they're talking about (e.g., ""five-foot step"").  But you'll catch the wave well enough, as the Mexicans say.There are two things that sadden me:#1:  Unfortunately, most of this movie is available you-know-how.  This is unfortunate:  if you watch it there, you're doing yourself a disservice.  Finally I felt so guilty I bought it the proper way and have been very happy viewing all the stuff I missed.#2:  These guys -- at least the core crew -- are still at it, though they have gotten away from the chief thing that I found so inexhaustibly hilarious in this movie:  cutting back and forth between the fantasy world and the gaming table.

Never having heard about this movie, it was a pleasant surprise when I stumbled on this through my on-line rental service.No spoilers from me; the movie follows a group of RPG players and the Dungeon Master (DM) as they try to complete a difficult adventure. The on screen action switches between the gamers and their fantasy alter egos. As the party fails time and time again to complete the task at hand, they realize that they need ""new blood"" and recruit a new player (the ultra rare girl gamer). The adventure takes off from there, both in the real world and in the RPG.This movie perfectly captures the feel of many game sessions I have been in (we had an odd group) and the fantasy environment is really well presented. The players include the ""rules lawyer"", an excitable cross gender player (a male playing a female character), a hack and slash fighter type, and the new touchy feely girl player. Their real life attitudes translate into some very funny game action.A really great movie, and not only for gamers, highly recommended!CFH",5,Best Gamer Movie Ever!

1050150,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B000MR9EQM,Graves,"[3, 4]","The Gamers, Dorkness Rising is aimed at a very narrow niche but if you're in that niche, it's hilarious. The idea is that a group of Dungeons and Dragons players is having problems. They are the stereotypical group of poorly socialized individuals who live for their weekly games, but are managing to also run down their game by going off to seduce tavern wenches and the like at the drop of a hat, just because they can.  Their rooms are covered in gaming posters and the back ground are piles of pizza boxes and cans of soda.This is particularly hard on the game leader because he's been using the game to try and break his writer's block but as the games become less epic and more dyspeptic he is losing hope. In an act of desperation he is able to convince a woman he knows, a former girl friend of one of the other players, to come and help out to try and bring the game back on topic.The fun of the film is that it alternates between the `players' sitting around a table waving rule books at each other and the fantasy adventure, where you see the `players' now dressed as their characters going through the adventure.To look at it is cheesy but it's supposed to be, that's why it worked.

Not exactly a hardcore one, I only picked up the hobby in college and even then was never all that invested in it as many are, but given an opportunity I'll gladly sit down to take part in a story and roll some dice around.  The oddity of that last sentence should serve well to illustrate how difficult it can be to explain the appeal of the hobby to the general public.  Now, if I'm ever hard pressed to explain why I find the experience rewarding, I point people towards this movie.To put it simply, this movie is the first movie about gamers that's been able to come off sounding credible.  The characters are all well fleshed out, the script is as hiliarious as one would expect coming from the Dead Gentlemen, and at the end of the day it's a very well rounded movie.  I actually watched this with my family, none of whom had any experience or for that matter understanding of how RPG's worked, and much to my surprise they all found something to like.  It helps that they include a character who has never gamed until the events in the film, allowing for a certain degree of exposition concerning the mechanics and principles behind D&D; to be seamlessly integrated into the story.  It's a simple touch, but it means that unlike the first film it's really quite easy for someone with no prior knowledge to get some of the in-jokes.Putting the script aside for a moment, there's a lot more to recommend this film as well.  The film was put together with a low budget, and while you wouldn't mistake it for a major blockbuster that budget was put to extremely good use.  Frankly the movie looks like it should have cost a lot more to produce.  The picture quality is very good, and the sets, costumes, and effects all do their jobs admirably in selling the film.  So yes, you're not likely to mistake it for something you'd see in a theater.  But it's at least up to the quality of a decent made-for-TV movie, which is more than a lot of independent films can say these days.I can't really go into much more detail without giving things away, but sufficed to say this rather disarming comedy does an amazing job of conveying all the odd ingenuity, fervor, and joy that can be drawn out by a good gaming group.  Gamers will appreciate it , and non-gamers will appreciate it for the insight it gives into their gaming friends.  Odds are if you're looking at this in the first place, you really don't need me to sell it to you much more than that.",5,Perhaps one of the first films about gamers with mass appeal.,1253836800,"09 25, 2009",2009,2478,"[""'ll"", 'admit', ""'m"", 'gamer', 'Not', 'exactly', 'hardcore', 'one', 'only', 'picked', 'up', 'hobby', 'college', 'even', 'then', 'was', 'never', 'invested', 'many', 'are', 'given', 'opportunity', ""'ll"", 'gladly', 'sit', 'down', 'take', 'part', 'story', 'roll', 'dice', 'oddity', 'last', 'sentence', 'should', 'serve', 'well', 'illustrate', 'how', 'difficult', 'can', 'be', 'explain', 'appeal', 'hobby', 'general', 'public', 'Now', ""'m"", 'ever', 'hard', 'pressed', 'explain', 'why', 'find', 'experience', 'rewarding', 'point', 'people', 'movie.To', 'put', 'simply', 'movie', 'first', 'movie', 'gamers', 'been', 'able', 'come', 'off', 'sounding', 'credible', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'fleshed', 'out', 'script', 'as', 'hiliarious', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'coming', 'Dead', 'Gentlemen', 'end', 'day', 'very', 'well', 'rounded', 'movie', 'actually', 'watched', 'family', 'none', 'whom', 'had', 'experience', 'matter', 'understanding', 'how', 'RPG', 'worked', 'much', 'surprise', 'found', 'something', 'like', 'include', 'character', 'who', 'never', 'gamed', 'events', 'film', 'allowing', 'certain', 'degree', 'exposition', 'concerning', 'mechanics', 'principles', 'D', 'D', 'be', 'seamlessly', 'integrated', 'story', 'simple', 'touch', 'first', 'film', 'really', 'quite', 'easy', 'someone', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'get', 'in-jokes.Putting', 'script', 'aside', 'moment', 'lot', 'more', 'recommend', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'low', 'budget', 'would', ""n't"", 'mistake', 'major', 'blockbuster', 'budget', 'was', 'put', 'extremely', 'good', 'use', 'Frankly', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'cost', 'lot', 'more', 'produce', 'picture', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'sets', 'costumes', 'effects', 'do', 'jobs', 'admirably', 'selling', 'film', 'So', 'yes', ""'re"", 'not', 'likely', 'mistake', 'something', ""'d"", 'see', 'theater', 'least', 'up', 'quality', 'decent', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'more', 'lot', 'independent', 'films', 'can', 'say', 'days.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'much', 'more', 'detail', 'giving', 'things', 'away', 'sufficed', 'say', 'rather', 'disarming', 'comedy', 'amazing', 'job', 'conveying', 'odd', 'ingenuity', 'fervor', 'joy', 'can', 'be', 'drawn', 'out', 'good', 'gaming', 'group', 'Gamers', 'will', 'appreciate', 'non-gamers', 'will', 'appreciate', 'insight', 'gaming', 'friends', 'Odds', 'are', ""'re"", 'looking', 'first', 'place', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'sell', 'much', 'more']",The Gamers: Dorkness Rising

The look on the GM's face when his story created an unusal but satifying character boon for his NPC was priceless.Every group has the ego nut who wants to stick with the rules when it suits him but wants to bring out a light saber and a machine gun when he's in a tight spot--and ends up arguing with all the players and the GM.Then there is the newbie who finds a way to make her character work and because it is her first and only character, refuses to allow that character to die--or the mission to fail.  This forces the others in the group to actually finish the campaign--and for the rest of the group to enjoy the game.The other two players were also priceless.
