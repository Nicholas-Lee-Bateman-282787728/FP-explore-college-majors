The problem is the final season is bittersweet due to the fact that Nick and Jessica have now split (NOT divorced), so this DVD does not seem as great as it could've been if they'd stayed together.  It's noticeable in fact the newlyweds are having marital problems because they argue more than usual, especially in the beginning of the opening episode.  Still, the blonde moments that first made the show a surefire hit are here.  Good show, but somehow the fact they've split takes most of the charm.",3,The final season,1134432000,"12 13, 2005",2005,602,"[""'d"", 'always', 'liked', 'Nick', 'Jessica', 'couple', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'mature', 'together', 'Newlyweds', 'problem', 'final', 'season', 'bittersweet', 'due', 'fact', 'Nick', 'Jessica', 'have', 'now', 'split', 'NOT', 'divorced', 'so', 'DVD', 'not', 'seem', 'as', 'great', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', ""'d"", 'stayed', 'together', 'noticeable', 'fact', 'newlyweds', 'are', 'having', 'marital', 'problems', 'argue', 'more', 'usual', 'especially', 'beginning', 'opening', 'episode', 'Still', 'blonde', 'moments', 'first', 'made', 'show', 'surefire', 'hit', 'are', 'here', 'Good', 'show', 'somehow', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'split', 'most', 'charm']",N/A
940771,A1PQQPNRKV1OXD,B000BDGW3K,Chris Eberlein,"[7, 8]","I always enjoyed Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey as a couple.  Sure, their hit reality TV made them true stars in 2003, but there was always something inviting and uninhibited brought by the two singers, most especially seen in Jessica Simpson.  It's sad to think that at the time of this DVD's release they had experienced a separation that's led to filing for divorce because in the first season it was obvious the two had definite affection for each other and were truly in love.  I believe they both need to go to marriage counseling since it was Newlyweds that probably led to their separation due to the sudden boom in popularity and demand because I think Nick and Jessica could get over their career anxiety.  The blonde moments Simpson has become famous for are here, though fewer and less ridiculous than the infamous Chicken of the Sea tuna comment, and it's apparent from the opening episode that the bickering is getting more heated.  Still, it's an entertaining show, though it lacks the pizzazz it'd have had the couple continued doing what their show Newlyweds was really about: being married.",3,"Sad, but entertaining",1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,1109,"['always', 'enjoyed', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'Nick', 'Lachey', 'couple', 'Sure', 'hit', 'reality', 'TV', 'made', 'true', 'stars', '2003', 'there', 'was', 'always', 'something', 'inviting', 'uninhibited', 'brought', 'two', 'singers', 'most', 'especially', 'seen', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'sad', 'think', 'time', 'DVD', 'release', 'had', 'experienced', 'separation', 'led', 'filing', 'divorce', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'obvious', 'two', 'had', 'definite', 'affection', 'other', 'were', 'truly', 'love', 'believe', 'need', 'go', 'marriage', 'counseling', 'was', 'Newlyweds', 'probably', 'led', 'separation', 'due', 'sudden', 'boom', 'popularity', 'demand', 'think', 'Nick', 'Jessica', 'could', 'get', 'over', 'career', 'anxiety', 'blonde', 'moments', 'Simpson', 'become', 'famous', 'are', 'here', 'fewer', 'less', 'ridiculous', 'infamous', 'Chicken', 'Sea', 'tuna', 'comment', 'apparent', 'opening', 'episode', 'bickering', 'getting', 'more', 'heated', 'Still', 'entertaining', 'show', 'pizzazz', ""'d"", 'have', 'had', 'couple', 'continued', 'doing', 'what', 'show', 'Newlyweds', 'was', 'really', 'being', 'married']",N/A

Not as enjoyable as the first 3 seasons, but if you are a fan of the show (as I am) you will still find it entertaining.

I ordered it and while I still love the show, the last season it seamed as though they were just going through the motions of being married, and you could tell there were some serious problems in the relationship. Its too bad, because you could tell they really were in love when they first got married, but then it all fell apart. Marriage is difficult, but I'm sure its harder when the whole world can watch your relationship being plastered across the media and TV.

940778,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B000BDGW3K,Nicholas Carroll,"[1, 7]","It's painful to watch the final season of the show, as the DVD was released just after Jessica Simpson filed for divorce. Just watch the episodes surrounding New Year's 2005 and Valentine's Day. Both Jessica and Nick make big pronouncements as to their love for one another early in the New Year...so what happened?It's hard not to be a cynic regarding their marriage. The tabloids have been at it all year long, almost seeming to salivate at the prospect of their spliting up. Why give them the satisfaction? Stick out your marriage. It's worth it. Prove the skeptics wrong! Unless, of course, the marriage was all a sham to begin with, a publicity stunt for a ""reality TV show"" meant to propel them into super-stardom. Well, it worked. Jessica leapfrogged over Britney in terms of popularity, fame, and money.The one episode that makes me most skeptical of the show is the final one where they pack up the house to move. The way Nick and Jessica went through their things and offered, ""remember when"" moments to each other seemed very contrived, as though they were acting for a final nostalgia show to end the series. When it turns out that they weren't really moving out of the house, that was the clincher. They faked the series ending for the sake of the show (to close it with an appropriate end).With their first 2 years of marriage on dvd, nicely edited, it would have been a great gift to their future, unborn children...as who wouldn't want to see what their parents were like as newlyweds? Honestly, I am a bit heartbroken for the two of them...as they seem very good together. Why give up on marriage now? Work out your problems for the sake of the relationship. Maybe they might reconsider and reconcile, or maybe the breakup is real. Whatever the case, I'm sure this show will prove an embarrassment to both of them in the future when they find new loves and relationships outside of camera range. What will both of their significant others think of this DVD existing forever as a testiment to another failed Hollywood relationship? What does it all mean?Well, Jessica, I love hearing you say ""Nick"" all the time. If you're looking for another Nick who will love and cherish you, I'm available! You're cute, funny, and your statements that others take as a sign of stupidity, I find endearing.
