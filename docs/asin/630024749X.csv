Even thought he is not in the protection business a mysterious man pays him more than enough money, similar to ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941) to make it worth his while, to protect a young lady.He finds the lady already dead and while leaning over her is dispatched him self. You would think it could end her however as with all things unsettled Browning is assigned to return and solve his murder. One hitch is he must go back as a dog (Benji.)My favorite quote was:Browning: Why can't I go back into my own body?Higgins: Because it has a hole in it.Jane Semour (Jackie) a writer interested in the case is surprised to see Benji or B.J. show up everywhere she goes but later nothing surprises her. Omar Sharif (Bart) is also surprised to see Benji show up everywhere, he is beginning to suspect B.J. of being the devil. Soon he is sure of it.Surprise!!!According to the cover:Plans to shoot part of the film in London had to be canceled when the producers learned that all animals brought into England must be quarantined for six months. Instead, the company moved to the streets of downtown Montreal, which were made over to resemble London.This story is very similar to what happened in the movie ""Heaven Can Wait"" (1978), in which he has to return to a temporary body.Heaven Can Wait",4,A pretty good detective story,1143849600,"04 1, 2006",2006,1333,"['Browning', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'privet', 'investigator', 'Even', 'thought', 'not', 'protection', 'business', 'mysterious', 'man', 'more', 'enough', 'money', 'similar', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', '1941', 'make', 'while', 'protect', 'young', 'lady.He', 'lady', 'already', 'dead', 'leaning', 'dispatched', 'would', 'think', 'could', 'end', 'however', 'things', 'unsettled', 'Browning', 'assigned', 'return', 'solve', 'murder', 'One', 'hitch', 'must', 'go', 'back', 'dog', 'Benji', 'favorite', 'quote', 'was', 'Browning', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'own', 'body', 'Higgins', 'hole', 'it.Jane', 'Semour', 'Jackie', 'writer', 'interested', 'case', 'surprised', 'see', 'Benji', 'B.J', 'show', 'up', 'everywhere', 'later', 'nothing', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'Bart', 'also', 'surprised', 'see', 'Benji', 'show', 'up', 'everywhere', 'beginning', 'suspect', 'B.J', 'being', 'devil', 'Soon', 'sure', 'it.Surprise', 'According', 'cover', 'Plans', 'shoot', 'part', 'film', 'London', 'had', 'be', 'canceled', 'when', 'producers', 'learned', 'animals', 'brought', 'England', 'must', 'be', 'quarantined', 'six', 'months', 'Instead', 'company', 'moved', 'streets', 'downtown', 'Montreal', 'were', 'made', 'resemble', 'London.This', 'story', 'very', 'similar', 'what', 'happened', 'movie', 'Heaven', 'Can', 'Wait', '1978', 'return', 'temporary', 'body.Heaven', 'Can', 'Wait']",N/A

226745,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,630024749X,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 3]","1980's Oh! Heavenly Dog, Benji's third movie, is quite a contrast from Benji's first two films. Benji and For the Love of Benji were quintessential family films that told touching stories of canine cunning and heroics entirely from the perspective of the furry little hero; there, Benji's acting prowess could move you to tears in moments of crisis and lift you sky-high when Benji finally managed to safely rescue the humans he loved. Those films had funny moments, but they were basically built upon drama and conveyed serious messages. Oh! Heavenly Dog is a straight-up comedy.Chevy Chase plays a private investigator named Browning, whom we meet during the last hour of his life. Hired to protect a certain young lady, he soon finds her - and then himself - murdered. He then finds himself in an afterlife processing center, where he learns he is considered no better than a marginal applicant for heaven; fortunately for him, he gets one last chance to prove himself worthy. All he has to do is go back to earth and solve the case of his own murder - and he has to go back in the form of a little dog because no human bodies are available at the moment. Thus we finally meet Benji (some twenty-two minutes into the film). We do see the rest of the film from Benji's perspective, but this time around, we can actually hear his thoughts - because they are Browning's thoughts. Cracking a murder case is hard enough when you have hands and a human voice; trying to accomplish it when you are a stray dog is even tougher.Fortune smiles upon the canine Browning when he meets up with the attractive young lady he bumped into mere moments before his earthly demise, for she is actually researching a book on the murders. For her part, Jackie (Jane Seymour) is increasingly astounded to find the little dog she calls B.J. everywhere she goes while researching the crime. Seymour has a great rapport with Benji, and that is crucial to making this film work as well as it does. Benji himself is marvelous and really gets to show off his amazing skills before the camera. Among other things, you'll see him finding ways into and out of different locations, using the telephone, writing (sort of) with a pencil, performing a few stunts that look to me like they must have hurt just a little bit, and weaving his way through traffic in a number of chase scenes. This film doesn't allow for the type of emotional moments that are there to be experienced in his earlier films, but Benji's acting skills help make the ending of this one rather touching, actually. Great credit is due to Benji's trainer, owner, and best friend Frank Inn for the amazing skills Benji showcases throughout the film.You'll notice this is a PG movie, which is quite unusual for a Joe Camp production. So, while this is still a great family film that I certainly loved as a kid, parents should be aware of the presence of adult language and a few sexual innuendoes spread over the course of the film. Being murdered and having to come back and investigate the crime in the form of a dog is bound to make a fellow curse a little bit. As for the innuendoes, today's generation of kids will probably understand most of them; back in the 70s, kids like me didn't have a clue as to the adult humor inserted into this fun film about an amazing little dog. Benji fans will eat this movie up, but it is hard to say how Chevy Chase fans will respond to it (I'm not much of a Chevy Chase fan) - still, it's impossible not to love Benji so I can't see how anyone can fail to enjoy Oh! Heavenly Dog.Look for Joe Camp, the man behind the whole Benji phenomenon, in a cameo appearance as one half of a pair of movers. It's also interesting to note that, while the story is set in London, most of the filming took place in Quebec because England required all incoming animals to be quarantined for six months upon their arrival. Finally, one should note that the original Benji retired after his first feature film, but this second Benji is just as huggable (not to mention cute and fluffy) as the first one.",5,A comedic showcase for America's most huggable hero,1170806400,"02 7, 2007",2007,4061,"['1980', 'Oh', 'Heavenly', 'Dog', 'Benji', 'third', 'movie', 'quite', 'contrast', 'Benji', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'Benji', 'Love', 'Benji', 'were', 'quintessential', 'family', 'films', 'told', 'touching', 'stories', 'canine', 'cunning', 'heroics', 'entirely', 'perspective', 'furry', 'little', 'hero', 'there', 'Benji', 'acting', 'prowess', 'could', 'move', 'tears', 'moments', 'crisis', 'lift', 'sky-high', 'when', 'Benji', 'finally', 'managed', 'safely', 'rescue', 'humans', 'loved', 'films', 'had', 'funny', 'moments', 'were', 'basically', 'built', 'drama', 'conveyed', 'serious', 'messages', 'Oh', 'Heavenly', 'Dog', 'straight-up', 'comedy.Chevy', 'Chase', 'private', 'investigator', 'named', 'Browning', 'whom', 'meet', 'last', 'hour', 'life', 'Hired', 'protect', 'certain', 'young', 'lady', 'soon', 'then', 'murdered', 'then', 'afterlife', 'processing', 'center', 'where', 'considered', 'no', 'better', 'marginal', 'applicant', 'heaven', 'fortunately', 'one', 'last', 'chance', 'prove', 'worthy', 'do', 'go', 'back', 'earth', 'solve', 'case', 'own', 'murder', 'go', 'back', 'form', 'little', 'dog', 'human', 'bodies', 'are', 'available', 'moment', 'Thus', 'finally', 'meet', 'Benji', 'twenty-two', 'minutes', 'film', 'do', 'see', 'rest', 'film', 'Benji', 'perspective', 'time', 'around', 'can', 'actually', 'hear', 'thoughts', 'are', 'Browning', 'thoughts', 'Cracking', 'murder', 'case', 'hard', 'enough', 'when', 'have', 'hands', 'human', 'voice', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'when', 'are', 'stray', 'dog', 'even', 'tougher.Fortune', 'smiles', 'canine', 'Browning', 'when', 'up', 'attractive', 'young', 'lady', 'bumped', 'mere', 'moments', 'earthly', 'demise', 'actually', 'researching', 'book', 'murders', 'part', 'Jackie', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'increasingly', 'astounded', 'find', 'little', 'dog', 'B.J', 'everywhere', 'researching', 'crime', 'Seymour', 'great', 'rapport', 'Benji', 'crucial', 'making', 'film', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'Benji', 'marvelous', 'really', 'show', 'off', 'amazing', 'skills', 'camera', 'other', 'things', ""'ll"", 'see', 'finding', 'ways', 'different', 'locations', 'using', 'telephone', 'writing', 'sort', 'pencil', 'performing', 'few', 'stunts', 'look', 'must', 'have', 'hurt', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'weaving', 'way', 'traffic', 'number', 'chase', 'scenes', 'film', ""n't"", 'allow', 'type', 'emotional', 'moments', 'are', 'there', 'be', 'experienced', 'earlier', 'films', 'Benji', 'acting', 'skills', 'help', 'make', 'ending', 'one', 'rather', 'touching', 'actually', 'Great', 'credit', 'due', 'Benji', 'trainer', 'owner', 'best', 'friend', 'Frank', 'Inn', 'amazing', 'skills', 'Benji', 'film.You', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'PG', 'movie', 'quite', 'unusual', 'Joe', 'Camp', 'production', 'So', 'still', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'certainly', 'loved', 'kid', 'parents', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'presence', 'adult', 'language', 'few', 'sexual', 'innuendoes', 'spread', 'course', 'film', 'Being', 'murdered', 'having', 'come', 'back', 'investigate', 'crime', 'form', 'dog', 'bound', 'make', 'fellow', 'curse', 'little', 'bit', 'innuendoes', 'today', 'generation', 'kids', 'will', 'probably', 'understand', 'most', 'back', '70s', 'kids', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'adult', 'humor', 'inserted', 'fun', 'film', 'amazing', 'little', 'dog', 'Benji', 'fans', 'will', 'eat', 'movie', 'up', 'hard', 'say', 'how', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'fans', 'will', 'respond', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'fan', 'still', 'impossible', 'not', 'love', 'Benji', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'can', 'fail', 'enjoy', 'Oh', 'Heavenly', 'Dog.Look', 'Joe', 'Camp', 'man', 'whole', 'Benji', 'phenomenon', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'one', 'half', 'pair', 'movers', 'also', 'interesting', 'note', 'story', 'set', 'London', 'most', 'filming', 'took', 'place', 'Quebec', 'England', 'required', 'incoming', 'animals', 'be', 'quarantined', 'six', 'months', 'arrival', 'Finally', 'one', 'should', 'note', 'original', 'Benji', 'retired', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'second', 'Benji', 'just', 'huggable', 'not', 'mention', 'cute', 'fluffy', 'first', 'one']",N/A

226749,A1Q1PP3Z4QDUQM,630024749X,Farffleblex Plaffington,"[1, 1]","For the third Benji feature film, director Joe Camp decided to head far out into left field.  After two films told from a dog's perspective and that consisted mostly of Benji running, it was a good move to do something drastically different, and it produced a film that matches the first one in quality.The first unusual thing that Camp did was to hire three stars who were big box office attractions in 1980--Chevy Chase, Jane Seymour and Omar Sharif.  The previous two films featured unknowns.Next, he made Oh Heavenly Dog essentially a human story.  The film really hinges on Chase's character, Benjamin Browning, who becomes a pawn in a relatively complex plot of deceit.  Camp displayed an affection for conspiracy-like action/thriller subplots in the two previous films, but here that becomes the primary focus, and because of this, the script is better written and paced.The criminal aspects of the first two films had something of an odd fit within films that were essentially geared towards young children (as did the plethora of untranslated Greek in the second film), but in Oh Heavenly Dog, Camp aims for a combination of an older, tween and teen crowd as well as adults.  This is made quickly apparent in another unusual feature--a strong sense of humor, Chevy Chase-style.  There are implicit gay jokes and lots of sexual innuendo jokes here.  There is also very natural sounding, light profanity.  And less humorously, but also more adult, there is a bit more violence.Even more left field for a Benji movie in 1980, Oh Heavenly Dog quickly heads for the fantasy genre, and through this, Benji becomes and remains something of a fantasy character.  It's a move that's completely unexpected, plotwise, but it works remarkably well.  Camp's purely fantasy settings and characters are very entertaining and even a bit charming.Because of the plot and Chase, and maybe somewhat as an intentional move directorially, most of Oh Heavenly Dog plays like a typical Chase detective film, like Foul Play (1978), or like the Fletch films (1985 & 1989) that came later.  I hadn't paid much attention to Chase for awhile--I was one of the people a bit turned off by his off-screen behavior, as evidenced in his interactions with the Howard Stern Show, for example--but Oh Heavenly Dog has reawakened my interest in him, because he's excellent here.  It's reminded me of how great he was in so many other films, even including later ones like Man of the House (1995).On a final note, what a coup Camp managed in getting the music he did for Oh Heavenly Dog.  Paul McCartney's ""Arrow Through Me"", one of my favorite solo songs of his, fits the film perfectly.  Euel Box even gives us orchestral variations on it throughout the film.  Camp also managed to get a couple Elton John songs, and used Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition for an art gallery scene.  The music helps support an already fantastic film.",4,Left field ain't a bad place to be,1155686400,"08 16, 2006",2006,2911,"['third', 'Benji', 'feature', 'film', 'director', 'Joe', 'Camp', 'decided', 'head', 'far', 'out', 'left', 'field', 'two', 'films', 'told', 'dog', 'perspective', 'consisted', 'mostly', 'Benji', 'running', 'was', 'good', 'move', 'do', 'something', 'drastically', 'different', 'produced', 'film', 'first', 'one', 'quality.The', 'first', 'unusual', 'thing', 'Camp', 'did', 'was', 'hire', 'three', 'stars', 'who', 'were', 'big', 'box', 'office', 'attractions', '1980', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'featured', 'unknowns.Next', 'made', 'Oh', 'Heavenly', 'Dog', 'essentially', 'human', 'story', 'film', 'really', 'Chase', 'character', 'Benjamin', 'Browning', 'who', 'pawn', 'relatively', 'complex', 'plot', 'deceit', 'Camp', 'displayed', 'affection', 'conspiracy-like', 'action/thriller', 'subplots', 'two', 'previous', 'films', 'here', 'primary', 'focus', 'script', 'better', 'written', 'paced.The', 'criminal', 'aspects', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'had', 'something', 'odd', 'fit', 'films', 'were', 'essentially', 'geared', 'towards', 'young', 'children', 'did', 'plethora', 'untranslated', 'Greek', 'second', 'film', 'Oh', 'Heavenly', 'Dog', 'Camp', 'combination', 'older', 'tween', 'teen', 'crowd', 'as', 'well', 'adults', 'made', 'quickly', 'apparent', 'unusual', 'feature', 'strong', 'sense', 'humor', 'Chevy', 'Chase-style', 'are', 'implicit', 'gay', 'jokes', 'lots', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'jokes', 'here', 'also', 'very', 'natural', 'sounding', 'light', 'profanity', 'less', 'humorously', 'also', 'more', 'adult', 'bit', 'more', 'violence.Even', 'more', 'left', 'field', 'Benji', 'movie', '1980', 'Oh', 'Heavenly', 'Dog', 'quickly', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'Benji', 'something', 'fantasy', 'character', 'move', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'plotwise', 'remarkably', 'well', 'Camp', 'purely', 'fantasy', 'settings', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'entertaining', 'even', 'bit', 'charming.Because', 'plot', 'Chase', 'maybe', 'somewhat', 'intentional', 'move', 'directorially', 'most', 'Oh', 'Heavenly', 'Dog', 'typical', 'Chase', 'detective', 'film', 'Foul', 'Play', '1978', 'Fletch', 'films', '1985', '1989', 'came', 'later', 'had', ""n't"", 'paid', 'much', 'attention', 'Chase', 'awhile', 'was', 'one', 'people', 'bit', 'turned', 'off', 'off-screen', 'behavior', 'evidenced', 'interactions', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'Show', 'example', 'Oh', 'Heavenly', 'Dog', 'reawakened', 'interest', 'excellent', 'here', 'reminded', 'how', 'great', 'was', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'even', 'including', 'later', 'ones', 'Man', 'House', '1995', 'final', 'note', 'what', 'coup', 'Camp', 'managed', 'getting', 'music', 'did', 'Oh', 'Heavenly', 'Dog', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Arrow', 'Me', 'one', 'favorite', 'solo', 'songs', 'film', 'perfectly', 'Euel', 'Box', 'even', 'orchestral', 'variations', 'film', 'Camp', 'also', 'managed', 'get', 'couple', 'Elton', 'John', 'songs', 'used', 'Mussorgsky', 'Pictures', 'Exhibition', 'art', 'gallery', 'scene', 'music', 'support', 'already', 'fantastic', 'film']",N/A
226750,A1R7TXCKWDZNOQ,630024749X,"Gwyn Gwyrdd ""geek""","[9, 9]","For starters, let's say that this film is really....different. It is a great combination between suspense, comedy, and an oddly, romance. As a private detective, American, residing in London, Chevy Chase is hired to do a job that goes south and results in his own murder. Because his final destination is indeterminable, the powers that be send him back as a &quot;returnable&quot; to solve his own murder. The catch is, the only body available is a scruffy dog about to be hit by a garbage truck - enter Benji. By far, this is Benji's most adult film. This is not just a cutesy dog movie that you are used to seeing Benji in - there is definitely adult humor. Jane Seymour is beautiful and makes conversation with a dog seem totally natural (pretty remarkable if you ask me). For you Pride and Prejudice fans, look for a younger version of a famous occupant of Rosings Park.Chevy Chase does a remarkable job conveying his character when you consider the fact that most of the time, we only hear his voice and see Benji, whose actions were, I'm sure, not entirely predictable. As little as we see him, you still know Chevy Chase is there - because his undeniable wit never lets you forget his presence. The mystery is intriguing, even though we know from the start who the murderer is. The pleasure is watching our villain become aware that he is being outwitted by a dog.Another thing to look for - when Chevy Chase is in Heaven, watch for the special effects and sounds that are humorously borrowed from popular sci fi of the day (star trek, etc.), including a direct reference to Star Wars. On top of that, the film has a marvelous soundtrack, including songs by Paul McCartney and Elton John. Watch Jane Seymour driving her convertible along a country road to Elton John's, &quot;Return to Paradise&quot;, and tell me it doesn't get stuck in your head.If you appreciate Brittish humor, great actors, and some &quot;cute, fluffy types&quot; thrown in for good measure, then settle down on a rainy afternoon and enjoy O Heavenly Dog.",4,Charming mystery with British flair - and a dog!,1000857600,"09 19, 2001",2001,2035,"['starters', 'let', 'say', 'film', 'really', '.different', 'great', 'combination', 'suspense', 'comedy', 'oddly', 'romance', 'private', 'detective', 'American', 'residing', 'London', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'hired', 'do', 'job', 'south', 'results', 'own', 'murder', 'final', 'destination', 'indeterminable', 'powers', 'be', 'send', 'back', 'quot', 'returnable', 'quot', 'solve', 'own', 'murder', 'catch', 'only', 'body', 'available', 'scruffy', 'dog', 'be', 'hit', 'garbage', 'truck', 'enter', 'Benji', 'far', 'Benji', 'most', 'adult', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'cutesy', 'dog', 'movie', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'Benji', 'definitely', 'adult', 'humor', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'beautiful', 'conversation', 'dog', 'seem', 'totally', 'natural', 'pretty', 'remarkable', 'ask', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'fans', 'look', 'younger', 'version', 'famous', 'occupant', 'Rosings', 'Park.Chevy', 'Chase', 'remarkable', 'job', 'conveying', 'character', 'when', 'consider', 'fact', 'most', 'time', 'only', 'hear', 'voice', 'see', 'Benji', 'actions', 'were', ""'m"", 'sure', 'not', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'As', 'little', 'see', 'still', 'know', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'there', 'undeniable', 'wit', 'never', 'forget', 'presence', 'mystery', 'intriguing', 'even', 'know', 'start', 'who', 'murderer', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'villain', 'become', 'aware', 'being', 'outwitted', 'dog.Another', 'thing', 'look', 'when', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Heaven', 'watch', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'humorously', 'borrowed', 'popular', 'sci', 'fi', 'day', 'star', 'trek', 'etc', 'including', 'direct', 'reference', 'Star', 'Wars', 'top', 'film', 'marvelous', 'soundtrack', 'including', 'songs', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Elton', 'John', 'Watch', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'driving', 'convertible', 'country', 'road', 'Elton', 'John', 'quot', 'Return', 'Paradise', 'quot', 'tell', ""n't"", 'get', 'stuck', 'head.If', 'appreciate', 'Brittish', 'humor', 'great', 'actors', 'quot', 'cute', 'fluffy', 'types', 'quot', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'then', 'settle', 'down', 'rainy', 'afternoon', 'enjoy', 'O', 'Heavenly', 'Dog']",N/A
226751,A2HVL790PBWYTU,630024749X,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Case folks forgot, Chevy Chase was huge in the way back days, when he left Saturday Night Live to go do movies. A few years on top in the early '80s, yep, but then it was mostly downhill for the lazy, silly gent ever since. I can count on one hand the number of films that I really like in Chevy Chase's ""oeuvre."" Somewhere on that short list is OH HEAVENLY DOG, a fun mystery/fantasy picture I saw when I was a kid. It's got Chevy Chase's trademark wry one-liners and a bit of thatHeaven Can Waitflavor. And it's got one of my boyhood crushes, Jane Seymour, in it, and she as ever looks stunning. And yet, despite these pluses, I can't deny that OH HEAVENLY DOG very much falls into that guilty pleasure category. I like the product, but it's a flawed product.I dig the premise: An American private eye toiling on a case in rain-soaked London gets himself killed but is then sent back to solve his own murder. Except that he's sent back in the body of a mongrel dog. Jane Seymour plays a writer researching her first book, and she promptly gets caught up in a political scandal. A murderer lurks (it's really easy to figure out the bad guy), and this sinister bloke is quite desperate to keep the cover-up going, and this eventually places the writer in mortal jeopardy. So, cute and fluffy to the rescue. It's a hoot watching the bad guy come to a cold realization that the main threat to his deviously orchestrated schemes just may be a small, lovable mutt. Just check out his expression when he spies on the dog dialing a telephone...There's a bit of a jarring element with OH HEAVENLY DOG in that Benji is normally featured in wholesome family flicks. This picture, while pretty inoffensive, does offer some PG-13 language and moments of sexual innuendos. So it's not quite ideal for kids, although they'll certainly wow over all the four-pawed cuteness. On the other hand, this film isn't edgy enough and the dog is onscreen too much and performs way too much to really qualify as a straight-up grown-up film. So it's somewhere in that in-between limbo, although it certainly falls closer to a kid's sensibilities. I heard this bombed in the box office, and I can't help but think that partly it's because it tried to cater too much to both the child and the adult. The mystery itself is certainly more adult-oriented.All seven fans of Chevy Chase should know that their dude is only in the film for the first 22 minutes and then in two more scenes after that. Mostly it's Benji romping around chasing clues, befuddling the bad guy, and occasionally indulging in a bubble bath with Jane Seymour, with Chase providing voice support throughout all this. At this stage in his film career, Chase wasn't yet as vacuous or irritating as he was going to get. So what we have here is a more restrained, more enjoyable Chevy Chase. Meanwhile, Jane Seymour is simply marvelous and very beautiful - and how can a movie not take on a romantic feel once she walks in front of  a camera? As a counterpoint, Omar Sharif is great at looking as if he's about to go down with angry apoplexy (but a dog effing up your evil day might have that effect).I have to say I'm a little fed up with seeing Heaven portrayed as a bureaucracy, and while the lightsaber scene may have seemed a neat moment back in 1980, nowadays it just falls flat and even dated. And I love this movie, but I do agree that at times it does crawl along at a tedious pace.The DVD I have has the full-screen presentation, with the wide-screen version on the flipside. Its not so special features consist of trailers for other kid-friendly films and the trailer for OH HEAVENLY DOG with someone who sounds like Rod Serling providing the voicework.I mentioned earlier that I can count on one hand the number of Chevy Chase films that I like. These movies happen to beFoul Play,Seems Like Old Times,Fletch (The ""Jane Doe"" Edition),Memoirs of an Invisible Man,National Lampoon's Vacation (20th Anniversary Special Edition), and, of course, OH HEAVENLY DOG. Now just don't ask me how many fingers I have on my hand.",4,"""I don't like being cute. I don't like being fluffy.
