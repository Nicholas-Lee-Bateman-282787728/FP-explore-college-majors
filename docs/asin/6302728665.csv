The look is certainly right, but the plot is a cliche: small-town boy football star is recruited to help the preppies win their big game, and all goes well, until the prejudiced preppies discover that the hero is Jewish.

330067,A35MB3HSLQBXBG,6302728665,David Freydkin,"[5, 10]","School Ties is about a Jewish boy by name of David Greene (Brendan Frasier). He lives in a small blue-collar Pennsylvania town where he is a standout high school quarterback. David gets recruited to play for St. Matthews, a preporatory school for the wealthy. While at the prep school, David, with encouragement from those who recruited him, hides his Jewish identity. At first he fits in well with the other boys (cast includes Matt Damon, Benn Affleck and Chris O'Donnell), befriends them as well as a girl from a nearby girls prep school. However, all changes when his identity is revealed.I thought this was a very good movie. However, it was both unrealistic and biased. Firstly, I find it highly unlikely that in a real life situation, some of David's classmates (van Kelt and Connors for instance) would've stood up for him. In reality, the whole group would've probably stayed loyal to Dillon and agreed to expel David.Also, the movie attempts to portray David as the perfect hero and victim, which he is not. He is at fault in some ways. For example, he betrayed Dillon by pursuing his ""girlfriend"" Sally Wheeler, although it was obvious that Dillon was interested in her. David should have shown more respect and kept a distance for the time being.To conclude, the movie is a good entertaining watch but very over-the-top.",4,Good but unrealistic and biased,1101081600,"11 22, 2004",2004,1332,"['School', 'Ties', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'name', 'David', 'Greene', 'Brendan', 'Frasier', 'small', 'blue-collar', 'Pennsylvania', 'town', 'where', 'standout', 'high', 'school', 'quarterback', 'David', 'recruited', 'play', 'St.', 'Matthews', 'preporatory', 'school', 'wealthy', 'prep', 'school', 'David', 'encouragement', 'who', 'recruited', 'Jewish', 'identity', 'first', 'well', 'other', 'boys', 'cast', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Benn', 'Affleck', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'as', 'well', 'girl', 'nearby', 'girls', 'prep', 'school', 'However', 'changes', 'when', 'identity', 'revealed.I', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'However', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'biased', 'Firstly', 'find', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'real', 'life', 'situation', 'David', 'classmates', 'van', 'Kelt', 'Connors', 'instance', 'would', ""'ve"", 'stood', 'up', 'reality', 'whole', 'group', 'would', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'stayed', 'loyal', 'Dillon', 'agreed', 'expel', 'David.Also', 'movie', 'portray', 'David', 'perfect', 'hero', 'victim', 'not', 'fault', 'ways', 'example', 'betrayed', 'Dillon', 'pursuing', 'girlfriend', 'Sally', 'Wheeler', 'was', 'obvious', 'Dillon', 'was', 'interested', 'David', 'should', 'have', 'shown', 'more', 'respect', 'kept', 'distance', 'time', 'being.To', 'conclude', 'movie', 'good', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'very', 'over-the-top']",N/A
330068,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6302728665,Deborah Earle,"[11, 13]","""School Ties"" provides an excellent tale of the truth about the nostalgic past--about the polite and not-so polite hostility towards those perceived as inferior, dressed up in elegant as well as not-so-elegant surroundings. It is a story dealing mostly with people who appear to have every advantage in life and every opportunity for generosity towards others, but who are empty and bigoted. They choose to hate and to influence others in their circle to rail against the object of their hatred.Through it all Brendan Fraser carries himself with grace and dignity. He plays David Greene, a poor Scranton, Pennsylvania kid who is given a rare opportunity to better himself at a Massachusetts prep school in 1955. The film begins with a view of his tough neighborhood, and an alleyway brawl between himself and a few local anti-Semites. Soon afterwards, with last-minute advice from his father he arrives at St.Matthew's, a calm and stately academic environment where he becomes fast friends with the popular students, which include a congenial Chris O'Donnell as Chris Reece, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in an early joint appearance as Charlie Dillon and Chesty Smith, Andrew Lowrey as the vulnerable McGivern,  Cole Hauser as the charismatic Jack Conners, Randall Batinkoff as the courageously honest Rip Van Kelt, and the cold and distant Anthony Rapp as Richard ""McGoo"" Collins.The boys enjoy music, football games, and playing pranks on the French teacher together(An early scene of Fraser making noises like an ape during one such prank seems to have paved the way for him to play George of the Jungle a few years later)  . But Greene is soon exposed to his classmates' feelings about Jews, as well as those of Headmaster Dr. Bartram, played by Peter Donat, who barely covers his feelings with polite and restrained turns of phrase.David proves to be a worthy classmate and student, standing up for his friends when they are wronged, even by authority figures, winning friends with his unprentiousness and wit, helping his team win football games, and winning the heart of Charlie Dillon's friend, Sally Wheeler.An ethereal and angelic Amy Locane, who has the classic looks of a '50s model, has this part. During her initial appearance at a school dance, her striking beauty stands out from that of the other girls, and she is definitely at her most radiant and most demure in her scalloped off-the-shoulder velvet dress, dancing at a country club to a Rodgers and Hart (not Rodgers and Hammerstein, of course) tune . But in a way, her role is one of the most tragic because she leaves one with the sense that she might have been willing to accept David or anyone who has earned the right to be liked, regardless of origins, but has to surrender a potential love interest because of the predjudices of her family and friends. If we had to imagine a future for her, we might find her in a loveless marriage with someone whose religious background met her family's approval rather than a happy marriage with someone whose religious denonimation they were vehemently against.We see the academic pressure put on these students and how their strong desire to live up to their families' expectations results in their stooping to subterfuge. David suffers various setbacks after he is exposed as a Jew, which happens partially because the envious Charlie Dillon lashes out in frustration. He challenges his schoolmates to face up to their real feelings about him,  inspiring some of them to overcome their predjudices, and standing up to one authority figure who covertly and not so covertly encouraged the students to adopt such an attitude.Greene's biggest moment of triumph in the film comes as he walks across the campus after a profound moment of truth, rather symbolically adjusting the collar of his coat against a cold world, having battled a few of its injustices, and looking a little taller than the many young men from whom he otherwise appears no different, with his future vast before him.",5,Everything and Nothing,1063238400,"09 11, 2003",2003,3999,"['School', 'Ties', 'excellent', 'tale', 'truth', 'nostalgic', 'past', 'polite', 'not-so', 'polite', 'hostility', 'towards', 'perceived', 'inferior', 'dressed', 'up', 'elegant', 'as', 'well', 'not-so-elegant', 'surroundings', 'story', 'dealing', 'mostly', 'people', 'who', 'appear', 'have', 'advantage', 'life', 'opportunity', 'generosity', 'towards', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'empty', 'bigoted', 'choose', 'hate', 'influence', 'others', 'circle', 'rail', 'object', 'hatred.Through', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'grace', 'dignity', 'David', 'Greene', 'poor', 'Scranton', 'Pennsylvania', 'kid', 'who', 'given', 'rare', 'opportunity', 'better', 'Massachusetts', 'prep', 'school', '1955', 'film', 'view', 'tough', 'neighborhood', 'alleyway', 'brawl', 'few', 'local', 'anti-Semites', 'Soon', 'afterwards', 'last-minute', 'advice', 'father', 'St.Matthew', 'calm', 'stately', 'academic', 'environment', 'where', 'fast', 'friends', 'popular', 'students', 'include', 'congenial', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'Chris', 'Reece', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'early', 'joint', 'appearance', 'Charlie', 'Dillon', 'Chesty', 'Smith', 'Andrew', 'Lowrey', 'vulnerable', 'McGivern', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'charismatic', 'Jack', 'Conners', 'Randall', 'Batinkoff', 'courageously', 'honest', 'Rip', 'Van', 'Kelt', 'cold', 'distant', 'Anthony', 'Rapp', 'Richard', 'McGoo', 'Collins.The', 'enjoy', 'music', 'football', 'games', 'playing', 'pranks', 'French', 'teacher', 'together', 'early', 'scene', 'Fraser', 'making', 'noises', 'ape', 'one', 'such', 'prank', 'have', 'paved', 'way', 'play', 'George', 'Jungle', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Greene', 'soon', 'exposed', 'classmates', 'feelings', 'Jews', 'as', 'well', 'Headmaster', 'Dr.', 'Bartram', 'played', 'Peter', 'Donat', 'who', 'barely', 'feelings', 'polite', 'restrained', 'turns', 'phrase.David', 'proves', 'be', 'worthy', 'classmate', 'student', 'standing', 'up', 'friends', 'when', 'are', 'wronged', 'even', 'authority', 'figures', 'winning', 'friends', 'unprentiousness', 'wit', 'helping', 'team', 'win', 'football', 'games', 'winning', 'heart', 'Charlie', 'Dillon', 'friend', 'Sally', 'Wheeler.An', 'ethereal', 'angelic', 'Amy', 'Locane', 'who', 'classic', 'looks', ""'50s"", 'model', 'part', 'initial', 'appearance', 'school', 'dance', 'striking', 'beauty', 'out', 'other', 'girls', 'definitely', 'most', 'radiant', 'most', 'demure', 'scalloped', 'off-the-shoulder', 'velvet', 'dress', 'dancing', 'country', 'club', 'Rodgers', 'Hart', 'not', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'course', 'tune', 'way', 'role', 'one', 'most', 'tragic', 'one', 'sense', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'willing', 'accept', 'David', 'anyone', 'who', 'earned', 'right', 'be', 'liked', 'regardless', 'origins', 'surrender', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'predjudices', 'family', 'friends', 'had', 'imagine', 'future', 'might', 'find', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'someone', 'religious', 'background', 'met', 'family', 'approval', 'rather', 'happy', 'marriage', 'someone', 'religious', 'denonimation', 'were', 'vehemently', 'against.We', 'see', 'academic', 'pressure', 'put', 'students', 'how', 'strong', 'desire', 'live', 'up', 'families', 'expectations', 'results', 'stooping', 'subterfuge', 'David', 'various', 'setbacks', 'exposed', 'Jew', 'partially', 'envious', 'Charlie', 'Dillon', 'out', 'frustration', 'schoolmates', 'face', 'up', 'real', 'feelings', 'inspiring', 'overcome', 'predjudices', 'standing', 'up', 'one', 'authority', 'figure', 'who', 'covertly', 'not', 'so', 'covertly', 'encouraged', 'students', 'adopt', 'attitude.Greene', 'biggest', 'moment', 'triumph', 'film', 'campus', 'profound', 'moment', 'truth', 'rather', 'symbolically', 'adjusting', 'collar', 'coat', 'cold', 'world', 'having', 'battled', 'few', 'injustices', 'looking', 'little', 'taller', 'many', 'young', 'men', 'whom', 'otherwise', 'different', 'future', 'vast']",N/A

330073,AY12DBB0U420B,6302728665,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","My wife and I watched ""School Ties"" last night while staying in a cabin on a short vacation. The movie was lent to us. We both enjoyed the movie very much, but I was particularly struck by it. I grew up in the mid-50s and first went to the University of Colorado at that time. The movie was very true to the times and more so than just having the automobiles all the right ages. The language and the attitudes fit the times.I was particularly struck by the negative and blatantly outspoken dislike of Jews. Well, that's the way it was! I can remember several striking personal examples. In one case, I was befriended by my freshman chemistry lab partner (from Boston) who ultimately took me over to meet the guys in his fraternity. When I told some other friends (a group of about a half dozen) about the experience, they reacted in horror and disgust. That's a Jewish fraternity, one said. Your friend is a Jew! In another instance, I met a delightful and charming young lady from Chicago and went out with her a couple times. In our second get together she invited me into her sorority as I brought her home. I mentioned this to a couple friends and they reacted badly. That's a Jewish sorority, one remarked. You're dating a Jew! In both cases I was made to feel like a fool for not knowing any better. Well, I didn't know any better. How was I to know? I'd come from a small-town, somewhat-sheltered environment and had never knowingly met a Jew or run into this type of blatently anti-Jewish attitude until I went to the university. But, there it was widespread and the feeling was strong. Jewish students had their own fraternities and soroties because no one else would accept them. Even Catholics were frowned upon and had to hide their religious ties. And Mexicans, Asians and Blacks ranked so low, they weren't even discussed. Ah yes, mid-50s university life, and it was undoubtedly a microcosim of American life in general. In any case, if anyone views this movie and thinks that it isn't authentic, let me assure you that it is.The movie involved a working class Jewish kid from Pennsylvania who was recruited to a fancy eastern prep school for his football abilities. Ultimately, his goal was to enter Harvard. You might say that he was a closet Jew living in a high-prestige WASP school. His Jewishness was covered at first, but ultimately he was outed and his world crumbled around him in dramatic fashion. It's a very interesting study and very well done. The settings, the acting and the story are all first rate. It was painful for me to watch, which was the sign of an authentic depiction, in my opinion. I really enjoyed my days in the university, but I would never want to go back to the attitudes and prejudices that prevailed the mid-50s.It's an excellent movie. If you lived the 50s, it's even better.Gary Peterson",5,Excellent Period Depiction.,1273795200,"05 14, 2010",2010,2838,"['wife', 'watched', 'School', 'Ties', 'last', 'night', 'staying', 'cabin', 'short', 'vacation', 'movie', 'was', 'lent', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'was', 'particularly', 'struck', 'grew', 'up', 'mid-50s', 'first', 'went', 'University', 'Colorado', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'true', 'times', 'more', 'so', 'just', 'having', 'automobiles', 'right', 'ages', 'language', 'attitudes', 'fit', 'times.I', 'was', 'particularly', 'struck', 'negative', 'blatantly', 'outspoken', 'dislike', 'Jews', 'Well', 'way', 'was', 'can', 'remember', 'several', 'striking', 'personal', 'examples', 'one', 'case', 'was', 'befriended', 'freshman', 'chemistry', 'lab', 'partner', 'Boston', 'who', 'ultimately', 'took', 'meet', 'guys', 'fraternity', 'When', 'told', 'other', 'friends', 'group', 'half', 'dozen', 'experience', 'reacted', 'horror', 'disgust', 'Jewish', 'fraternity', 'one', 'said', 'friend', 'Jew', 'instance', 'met', 'delightful', 'charming', 'young', 'lady', 'Chicago', 'went', 'out', 'couple', 'times', 'second', 'get', 'together', 'invited', 'sorority', 'brought', 'home', 'mentioned', 'couple', 'friends', 'reacted', 'badly', 'Jewish', 'sorority', 'one', 'remarked', ""'re"", 'dating', 'Jew', 'cases', 'was', 'made', 'feel', 'fool', 'not', 'knowing', 'better', 'Well', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'How', 'was', 'know', ""'d"", 'come', 'small-town', 'somewhat-sheltered', 'environment', 'had', 'never', 'knowingly', 'met', 'Jew', 'run', 'type', 'blatently', 'anti-Jewish', 'attitude', 'went', 'university', 'was', 'widespread', 'feeling', 'was', 'strong', 'Jewish', 'students', 'had', 'own', 'fraternities', 'soroties', 'one', 'else', 'would', 'accept', 'Even', 'Catholics', 'were', 'frowned', 'had', 'hide', 'religious', 'ties', 'Mexicans', 'Asians', 'Blacks', 'ranked', 'so', 'low', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'discussed', 'Ah', 'yes', 'mid-50s', 'university', 'life', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'microcosim', 'American', 'life', 'general', 'case', 'anyone', 'movie', ""n't"", 'authentic', 'let', 'assure', 'movie', 'involved', 'working', 'class', 'Jewish', 'kid', 'Pennsylvania', 'who', 'was', 'recruited', 'fancy', 'eastern', 'prep', 'school', 'football', 'abilities', 'Ultimately', 'goal', 'was', 'enter', 'Harvard', 'might', 'say', 'was', 'closet', 'Jew', 'living', 'high-prestige', 'WASP', 'school', 'Jewishness', 'was', 'covered', 'first', 'ultimately', 'was', 'outed', 'world', 'crumbled', 'around', 'dramatic', 'fashion', 'very', 'interesting', 'study', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'settings', 'acting', 'story', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'was', 'painful', 'watch', 'was', 'sign', 'authentic', 'depiction', 'opinion', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'days', 'university', 'would', 'never', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'attitudes', 'prejudices', 'prevailed', 'mid-50s.It', 'excellent', 'movie', 'lived', '50s', 'even', 'better.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A

Not just acceptance of others, but acceptance of yourself. David hides apart of himself because it is convenient. But he learns at the end that denying his faith and ethnicity was wrong, though I can't exactly blame him. When he first arrives, he hears an anti-Semitic phrase (""I jewed him down"") by a guy he ends up caring about as the guy suffers a nervous breakdown because he failed a French test.Matt Damon is the villain. This was the first film I saw with Damon in it. He's definitely a p-rick. Incidentally, I don't like Matt Damon as an actor or person at all. Everytime I see him, he has this smug smirk on his face. He comes off as a real a-hole. In my opinion, he should play villains all the time because I don't buy him as the good guy, which is why I have avoided his Bourne...movies and basically anything else with him in it; except for the Talented Mr. Ripley where he also plays a sleazy villain.The cast list reads like a Brat Pack Part Deux: Brendan Fraser, Chris O'Donnell, Amy Locane, Matt Damon, and even a slightly chubby Ben Afflack (not a typo).What I also like about the film is the ending. It doesn't suffer from the usual Hollywood ending in which everything has to be neatly tied up at the end of 2 hours. I certainly like closure in most films, but with this film, there can really be no closure. David's fight against bigotry is going to be ongoing. At the end, no one has changed. And in real life, it's mostly like that. If Matt Damon's character had changed by the end, it would have been stupid. I'm pretty sure the thought police have a problem with the bigot not being reformed by the end, but bigotry can't change overnight.School Ties is a great movie.",5,The School Ties That Bind,1157500800,"09 6, 2006",2006,1959,"['School', 'Ties', 'poor', 'exceptional', 'football', 'player', 'who', 'accepted', 'prestigious', 'prep', 'school', 'scholarship', 'hide', 'Jewish', 'heritage.Once', 'revealed', 'jealous', 'jerk', 'everybody', 'him.The', 'film', 'examines', 'prejudice', 'acceptance', 'Not', 'just', 'acceptance', 'others', 'acceptance', 'David', 'apart', 'convenient', 'end', 'denying', 'faith', 'ethnicity', 'was', 'wrong', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'blame', 'When', 'first', 'anti-Semitic', 'phrase', 'jewed', 'down', 'guy', 'up', 'caring', 'guy', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'failed', 'French', 'test.Matt', 'Damon', 'villain', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'saw', 'Damon', 'definitely', 'p-rick', 'Incidentally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'actor', 'person', 'Everytime', 'see', 'smug', 'smirk', 'face', 'off', 'real', 'a-hole', 'opinion', 'should', 'play', 'villains', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'good', 'guy', 'why', 'have', 'avoided', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'basically', 'anything', 'else', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'where', 'also', 'sleazy', 'villain.The', 'cast', 'list', 'reads', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'Part', 'Deux', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'Amy', 'Locane', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'even', 'slightly', 'chubby', 'Ben', 'Afflack', 'not', 'typo', '.What', 'also', 'like', 'film', 'ending', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'everything', 'be', 'neatly', 'tied', 'up', 'end', '2', 'hours', 'certainly', 'closure', 'most', 'films', 'film', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'closure', 'David', 'fight', 'bigotry', 'going', 'be', 'ongoing', 'end', 'one', 'changed', 'real', 'life', 'mostly', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'character', 'had', 'changed', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stupid', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'thought', 'police', 'have', 'problem', 'bigot', 'not', 'being', 'reformed', 'end', 'bigotry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'change', 'overnight.School', 'Ties', 'great', 'movie']",N/A

The only problem is that the new guy is Jewish, and the school is as white and Christian as can be.This is a good, but not great movie, well-paced, with some compelling scenes, and a good blend of action, suspense and romance.  Starring as David Greene, Brendan Fraser shows more emotion and less woodenness than many of his later roles.  Matt Damon also stands out as Dillon, the boy pushed out of the spotlight when Fraser's character arrives.  There are some key scenes of developing friendship between the two that give their characters multi-dimensions, but in the end the screenplay makes Dillon less than likable.First, a new QB joins the team and takes your spot, then he takes your girl.  Finally, there is a challenge to the school honor code when someone cheats on a final exam.I thought another key sequence, that probably could have been done even better, was the ""12 Angry Men"" like scene with the other boys trying to decide who cheated on the test. Some of them step forward to Greene's defense, while others show their true bigotry and anti-Semitism.While Fraser and Damon stand out, most of the other characters fall into the usual prep school stereotypes: the understanding roommate, the wild boy, the geek narc, etc.I would have liked to have seen more development of the Chris O'Donnell character as Greene's roommate, but he does stand up for him.  I also would have liked to have seen more development of a mentor character, such as the coach.In the end, Fraser shows David's growth from idealistic, small town guy to one working the system while retaining his personal honor code and dignity after realizing how he had not been true to himself.It's also fun to see the early careers of Fraser, Damon, Ben Affleck and Chris O'Donnell.",3,Dead Poets Society + Bigotry in 1950s,1044748800,"02 9, 2003",2003,1908,"['star', 'quarterback', 'Pennsylvania', 'steel', 'town', 'recruited', 'play', 'elite', 'New', 'England', 'prep', 'school', 'can', 'defeat', 'arch-rival', 'only', 'problem', 'new', 'guy', 'Jewish', 'school', 'white', 'Christian', 'can', 'be.This', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'well-paced', 'compelling', 'scenes', 'good', 'blend', 'action', 'suspense', 'romance', 'Starring', 'David', 'Greene', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'more', 'emotion', 'less', 'woodenness', 'many', 'later', 'roles', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'also', 'out', 'Dillon', 'boy', 'pushed', 'spotlight', 'when', 'Fraser', 'character', 'are', 'key', 'scenes', 'developing', 'friendship', 'two', 'give', 'characters', 'multi-dimensions', 'end', 'screenplay', 'Dillon', 'less', 'likable.First', 'new', 'QB', 'team', 'spot', 'then', 'girl', 'Finally', 'challenge', 'school', 'honor', 'code', 'when', 'someone', 'final', 'exam.I', 'thought', 'key', 'sequence', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'even', 'better', 'was', '12', 'Angry', 'Men', 'scene', 'other', 'boys', 'trying', 'decide', 'who', 'cheated', 'test', 'step', 'forward', 'Greene', 'defense', 'others', 'show', 'true', 'bigotry', 'anti-Semitism.While', 'Fraser', 'Damon', 'stand', 'out', 'most', 'other', 'characters', 'fall', 'usual', 'prep', 'school', 'stereotypes', 'understanding', 'roommate', 'wild', 'boy', 'geek', 'narc', 'etc.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'development', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'character', 'Greene', 'roommate', 'stand', 'up', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'development', 'mentor', 'character', 'such', 'coach.In', 'end', 'Fraser', 'David', 'growth', 'idealistic', 'small', 'town', 'guy', 'one', 'working', 'system', 'retaining', 'personal', 'honor', 'code', 'dignity', 'realizing', 'how', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'true', 'himself.It', 'also', 'fun', 'see', 'early', 'careers', 'Fraser', 'Damon', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell""]",N/A

It's superbly made - the music by Maurice Jarre, one of the great film composers - is just one of the stand outs of this terrific film. The acting is genuine, heart felt, and strong. I wish Brendan Fraser had made more films like this, playing a real man, not the action hero kinds of things he did later. He really excels here - and so does Matt Damon, in a terrific, complex turn, echoing his later role in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" as a self-described ""mediocrity,"" riding the coattails of his much more talented father and brother.  Amy Locane, radiant here, is another superb actress we have not seen enough of in roles like this one. Unlike so many contemporary movies, which never seem to end, and have no sense of pace or story, ""School Ties"" has no fat at all: it's beautiful directed and photographed, beautifully scored, wonderfully acted and written. And its message, though sometimes overstated, is still applicable today: prejudice, in whatever form it takes, destroys lives and damages and diminishes all of us.  This theme, together with other themes in the picture of religious faith, loyalty to friends and family, the meaning of hard work, marks this as a very unusual picture for its time, right at the cusp of the greedy '90's, and there probably hasn't been as good a picture on this subject since.  This is a minor classic, without a doubt. One of those films you return to time and again, like an old friend, for the reassurance of decency and trying to do good in an often cold and harsh world.

He's such a sport about the scholarship kid coming in and taking his place on the football team. My favorite part is when he tells Green, ""If you get into Harvard, you'll deserve it,"" (subtext: unlike me). He was even prepared to take it like a man when Green steals his girl. But that horrible feeling of inadequacy -- that he's never going to live up to his brother's standard, that he's just a sham of his family's reputation, transforms magically into hate when he realizes his rival is a Jew.Dillon knows Green is the better man. He KNOWS it, but he still uses his religion to beat him down. It doesn't even matter whether Dillon believes the stereotypes. As long as some do, they can be used to attack the rival.Charlie Dillon makes an excellent villain because he can be identified with. Whether you or I would attack someone's religious faith isn't necessarily the question. When people are in dire straights, they tend to jettison their principles and grab whatever tool seems handiest and most effective. I love the fact that we get to see this guy at his best and his worst.When the question of the Honor Code arises, we get to see another side of the world faced by the outsider. Even if his classmates can get over their prejudice and remember that Green is a good guy, will that be enough to make them turn on one of their own? Even if they do, will it matter?This movie was so much better than it had to be.

A highly talented athlete, in a tough working class town, is given the chance of a lifetime:  a scholarship admission to one of the best prep schools in the US, a direct pipeline to Harvard.  All he needs to do is win a football game as quarterback, keep his grades up - and hide his identity as a Jew.The kid is a real winner, remarkable in fact.  He is tough, prepared to fight, shrewd, and with a highly disciplined intelligence.  His one flaw is his sensitivity to slights and racism, right smack in the middle of perfect waspdom, with presumptuous, entitled rich kids, many of whom are pretty good guys, but with hidden treachery and spoilt.  Still, he makes his way amongst them, even finds a wonderful girl at the apex of youthful beauty who is intelligent and likes the complexity of this boy.Of course, it doesn't work out and leads to a horrible existential struggle that illuminates the realties of class, privilege, and racism of the 1950s in the US.  Its limits are realistic, with no silly hollywoodesque ending that resolves everything neatly and happily, leaving the viewer in a conflict of ambiguity.  The acting, by many young actors who become major stars in the next 10 years, is absolutely first rate.  You have Frazer as the boy, Damon as his nemesis, but also many others of talent, just beginning to perfect their craft.

You'll find celebration of neither inspiring teachers nor of great literature in this bitter jeremiad.  No ""Dead Poets Society"" meets here, nor any ""The History Boys,"" either.  The satisfactions of honorable sportsmanship likewise find no room on a one-item agenda.  One can almost imagine Damon and Affleck putting their heads together and concluding they could pull off a better, more nuanced take of social class, privilege and education, then sitting down to write ""Good Will Hunting"" and collecting themselves Oscars five years later.True, post-World War II America was ripe for recognizing the intolerable injustices of discrimination permeating all strata of society.  In the realm of private education in that era, homophobia was by far the more insidiously lethal toxin and drove many more promising young men to suicide than ethnic slurs did.  Although this film imports virtually intact from the 1984 British film ""Another Country"" the tyranny of elite student societies as the perpetrators of injustices in the established order, School Ties prefers to thoroughly sweep under the rug not simply any suggestion of unspeakable vice but likewise the conflicting bonds of strongly felt friendships.This stifled subtext lends a voyeuristic--if not downright Freudian--charge to the gratuitous male nudity, not to mention bewilderment at the filmmakers' choice of the shower room for their movie's pivotal confrontation.  Were they thinking circumcision?  Not likely.  In that era, cut was more the rule than natural for American men.  So wassup with the naked young dudes?  Wouldn't a playing field, even a dining room, have been the more apt metaphor for conflict?One prefers not to imagine the filmmakers such single-purpose polemicists they wished to further weight their movie with truly morbid connotations. An implicit comparison with homophobia might be more instructive.  Even by the script's own terms, David Greene's futile attempt to hide his identity, a matter over which he had control, was more the source of distrust than his innate ethnicity.Among a well-educated upper class who sent their sons to private preparatory schools in the 50s, everyone certainly knew who was Jewish (and would immediately have clocked ""David Greene"" as a Jewish name--doh!), but it wasn't such a huge deal. Exactly like the WASPS, some were cool and some were pretentious jerks. Check with Holden Caulfield for his take on such matters.  Roman Catholics, of course, had their own schools.The vicious ethnic prejudice portrayed here is not only over-dramatized, but also historically inaccurate, and like most bigotry and racism, was (and sadly remains) far more rampant in the less privileged sectors of the social spectrum.  With the exception of an impressive collection of vintage Harris Tweed sport jackets sufficiently vast to outfit an entire school, too much of the movie misses its mark to maintain credibility.  No self-respecting New England blue-blood family, for example, could conceivably have had the execrable taste to send a colossal black Cadillac limousine more suitable for a presidential motorcade than to collect a son booted from boarding school.  That would be a chore reserved for the station wagon.At any of the better independent boarding schools, everyone certainly knew that to ever say ""Jew down"" (or anything similar) was so tacky as to mark the speaker as indelibly L.M.C., but were an automobile as lavishly ostentatious as WASP-boy Damon's limo ever to appear on campus, some bozo would have been all too likely to elicit guilty snickers with a muttered ""Jew canoe.""",2,Why Matt & Ben Wrote Good Will Hunting,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,3994,"['twenty-something', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'buck-naked', 'teen', 'preppies', 'scuffling', 'dormitory', 'showers', 'might', 'float', 'folks', 'boats', 'have', ""n't"", 'checked', 'see', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'bare', 'backside', 'also', 'around', 'bit', 'part', 'skirmish', 'curious', 'climactic', 'encounter', 'School', 'Ties', 'vintage', '1992', 'message', 'movie', 'belaboring', 'anti-Semitism', 'mid-1950s', ""'ll"", 'find', 'celebration', 'inspiring', 'teachers', 'great', 'literature', 'bitter', 'jeremiad', 'No', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'meets', 'here', 'History', 'Boys', 'satisfactions', 'honorable', 'sportsmanship', 'likewise', 'find', 'room', 'one-item', 'agenda', 'One', 'can', 'almost', 'imagine', 'Damon', 'Affleck', 'putting', 'heads', 'together', 'concluding', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'better', 'more', 'nuanced', 'take', 'social', 'class', 'privilege', 'education', 'then', 'sitting', 'down', 'write', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'collecting', 'Oscars', 'five', 'years', 'later.True', 'post-World', 'War', 'II', 'America', 'was', 'ripe', 'recognizing', 'intolerable', 'injustices', 'discrimination', 'permeating', 'strata', 'society', 'realm', 'private', 'education', 'era', 'homophobia', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'insidiously', 'lethal', 'toxin', 'drove', 'many', 'more', 'promising', 'young', 'men', 'suicide', 'ethnic', 'slurs', 'did', 'film', 'virtually', 'intact', '1984', 'British', 'film', 'Country', 'tyranny', 'elite', 'student', 'societies', 'perpetrators', 'injustices', 'established', 'order', 'School', 'Ties', 'prefers', 'thoroughly', 'sweep', 'rug', 'not', 'simply', 'suggestion', 'unspeakable', 'vice', 'likewise', 'conflicting', 'bonds', 'strongly', 'felt', 'friendships.This', 'stifled', 'subtext', 'voyeuristic', 'not', 'downright', 'Freudian', 'charge', 'gratuitous', 'male', 'nudity', 'not', 'mention', 'bewilderment', 'filmmakers', 'choice', 'shower', 'room', 'movie', 'pivotal', 'confrontation', 'Were', 'thinking', 'circumcision', 'Not', 'likely', 'era', 'cut', 'was', 'more', 'rule', 'natural', 'American', 'men', 'So', 'wassup', 'naked', 'young', 'dudes', 'Would', ""n't"", 'playing', 'field', 'even', 'dining', 'room', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'apt', 'metaphor', 'conflict', 'One', 'not', 'imagine', 'filmmakers', 'such', 'single-purpose', 'polemicists', 'wished', 'further', 'movie', 'truly', 'morbid', 'connotations', 'implicit', 'comparison', 'homophobia', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'instructive', 'Even', 'script', 'own', 'terms', 'David', 'Greene', 'futile', 'attempt', 'hide', 'identity', 'matter', 'had', 'control', 'was', 'more', 'source', 'distrust', 'innate', 'well-educated', 'upper', 'class', 'who', 'sent', 'sons', 'private', 'preparatory', 'schools', '50s', 'everyone', 'certainly', 'knew', 'who', 'was', 'Jewish', 'would', 'immediately', 'have', 'clocked', 'David', 'Greene', 'Jewish', 'name', 'doh', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'huge', 'deal', 'Exactly', 'WASPS', 'were', 'cool', 'were', 'pretentious', 'jerks', 'Check', 'Holden', 'Caulfield', 'take', 'such', 'matters', 'Roman', 'Catholics', 'course', 'had', 'own', 'schools.The', 'vicious', 'ethnic', 'prejudice', 'portrayed', 'here', 'not', 'only', 'over-dramatized', 'also', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'most', 'bigotry', 'racism', 'was', 'sadly', 'far', 'more', 'rampant', 'less', 'privileged', 'sectors', 'social', 'spectrum', 'exception', 'impressive', 'collection', 'vintage', 'Harris', 'Tweed', 'sport', 'jackets', 'sufficiently', 'vast', 'outfit', 'entire', 'school', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'mark', 'maintain', 'credibility', 'self-respecting', 'New', 'England', 'blue-blood', 'family', 'example', 'could', 'conceivably', 'have', 'had', 'execrable', 'taste', 'send', 'colossal', 'black', 'Cadillac', 'limousine', 'more', 'suitable', 'presidential', 'motorcade', 'collect', 'son', 'booted', 'boarding', 'school', 'would', 'be', 'chore', 'reserved', 'station', 'better', 'independent', 'boarding', 'schools', 'everyone', 'certainly', 'knew', 'ever', 'say', 'Jew', 'down', 'anything', 'similar', 'was', 'so', 'tacky', 'mark', 'speaker', 'indelibly', 'L.M.C.', 'were', 'automobile', 'lavishly', 'ostentatious', 'WASP-boy', 'Damon', 'limo', 'ever', 'appear', 'campus', 'bozo', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'likely', 'elicit', 'guilty', 'snickers', 'muttered', 'Jew', 'canoe']",N/A

It's amazing to look at the actors in the movie then and see how far they have come in their careers now. The ending of the movie was great as well. You watch this movie and see the anti-semitism, but you see how it transcribes easily to other religions, races, ethnicities and you have hope at the end that good will win out. This movie touches me immensely. It may not be one of the greatest movies ever made, but it is still a great story with wonderful acting and directing.",4,Wonderfully warming movie,1195084800,"11 15, 2007",2007,808,"['saw', 'movie', 'young', 'child', 'about', '8', '9', 'still', 'love', 'today', '23', 'year', 'old', 'not', 'one', 'movies', 'watch', 'child', 'grow', 'out', 'grow', 'up', 'story', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'wonderful', 'realistic', 'could', 'relate', 'character', 'plights', 'amazing', 'look', 'actors', 'movie', 'then', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'have', 'come', 'careers', 'now', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'watch', 'movie', 'see', 'anti-semitism', 'see', 'how', 'easily', 'other', 'religions', 'races', 'ethnicities', 'have', 'hope', 'end', 'good', 'will', 'win', 'out', 'movie', 'immensely', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'still', 'great', 'story', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'directing']",N/A
