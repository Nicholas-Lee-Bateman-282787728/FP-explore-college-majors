Still worth watching if for nothing else to see Veronica Lake just as she was  becoming a top draw.  More perky, than bombshell ( she was barely 5'0 tall, I believe), nonetheless, she knows how to deliver her lines with just the right lilt and intonation to be suggestive. Frederic March as her love interest was still considered a leading man at this time, but I think just barely. He was a little middle-ageish for this role considering Lake was only 20 years old in 1942, and she looks it. So not really much believeable chemistry from this pairing.Also, a very young and very attractive Susan Hayward as the shrewish fiancee.",3,"Amusing, light comedy",1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,718,"['Clever', 'film', 'funny', 'moments', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'laugh-out', 'loud', 'comedy', 'Still', 'worth', 'watching', 'nothing', 'else', 'see', 'Veronica', 'Lake', 'just', 'was', 'becoming', 'top', 'draw', 'More', 'perky', 'bombshell', 'was', 'barely', '5', '0', 'tall', 'believe', 'nonetheless', 'how', 'deliver', 'lines', 'just', 'right', 'lilt', 'intonation', 'be', 'suggestive', 'Frederic', 'March', 'love', 'interest', 'was', 'still', 'considered', 'leading', 'man', 'time', 'think', 'just', 'barely', 'was', 'little', 'middle-ageish', 'role', 'considering', 'Lake', 'was', 'only', '20', 'years', 'old', '1942', 'So', 'not', 'really', 'much', 'believeable', 'chemistry', 'pairing.Also', 'very', 'young', 'very', 'attractive', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'shrewish', 'fiancee']",I Married a Witch VHS

262484,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,6301706498,darragh o'donoghue,"[39, 42]","Rene Clair's greatest American film, with the old Surrealist turning what could have been merely a supernatural comic romp into something truly plangent.  Veronica Lake plays the spirit of a witch burnt by Puritans in the 17th century, cursing the descendents of her denouncer to eternal marital malaise (the wonderful period prologues predate Monty Python by decades in their anachronistic lampooning of history).  Fast forward to the present where the latest sap, Fredric March, is about to be married to a REAL witch (a fabulously imperious Susan Hayward), on the eve of running for governor as puppet for her media-baron father.  Lake decides on some spirited revenge, attempting to destroy March's life by making him fall in love with her; only, through a botched spell, finding herself smitten.'I Married a Witch' is more than an antique precursor to the incomparable TV series 'Bewitched'.  it is one of Clair's most expertly constructed farces, full of his recognisable art-deco geometry; with the mixture of sex, magic and politics provoking irresistable set-pieces, such as the pair's introduction in a burning hotel; Lake's pointed attempts to seduce and compromise March by commandeering his bedroom; or the glorious, sustained fiasco of the wedding sequence, a real shotgun wedding, complete with hurricanes, kitsch operetta and murder.  The corruption of 'interests'-dominated America and the impressionability of the electorate are satirised, while serious points are made about the country's historical legacy, the ghosts of its past materialising to avenge long-forgotten crimes.  Lake has never been more purringly lovable - I can believe her as a sorceress, sliding down curved bannisters, unpeeling her fur coat in taxis; March is one of the few dramatic actors who could excel in comedy while retaining serious pathos; only Robert Benchley could manage to make selfless friendship seem like lecherous self-interest.But 'Witch' offers even more.  The whole project of Surrealism was based on a very simple principle - the desire to make life, the everyday weighed down by banal routine, seem magical, fresh, new.  Before Lake comes into his life, March, a kind of Everyman, was depressed and helpless, on the threshold of all kinds of prisons, domestic and professional.  Lake's magic in this case is not simply the fantasy of genre, but a genuine transformative power, a spiritual enchantment, an offer of freedom through new insight, new sight.  Where once fire was a political tool of oppression, here it is purifying and engendering.  This is why the supernatural scenes here have an uncanny force you simply don't get in most fantasy films, that haunt you long after you've seen 'Witch'.  The last ten minutes are hard to beat in American film, comedy or otherwise.

His mother calls another woman to them, we find she is his bride-to-be, and receive a glimpse of how very bad it will indeed be for him and his descendants.  A man of authority moves through the crowd with a sapling, telling us they are planting it on the site to trap the spirits of the dead within the tree forever.  This is the beginning, and we jump forward in time from unhappy Worley, to unhappy Worley until &#8220;present day,&#8221; where we find the current Mr. Worley will marry badly tomorrow.So where does the &#8220;Witch&#8221; he married come in you ask?

There are 2 really excellent essays about the director and the production enclosed in a quality booklet. There is also a radio interview with the director from over 50 years ago.

She was called worse.  But for all that, she was quite effective as the vengeful sorceress Jennifer in this charming comedy.  Watching this delightful film, you can't see any evidence of the off-screen resentment and pure loathing.  (Personally, I'd love to hear all the details of Lake's shenanigans; apparently, she was quite the practical joker).  It's sad though, to think that's how she was remembered, as someone few wanted to work with and those who suffered through a movie with her rarely wanted to work with her again.  Even if she did nothing else of importance, she still had this to claim as a minor masterpiece.  This is a fun, sly film.

I don't have much to say other than this is a great transfer of a charming old movie that is just as good as I remember it from late-night TV many years ago. I chose the DVD rather then Blu-ray and have no quibbles at all about the quality. It's at least as good as all my other Criterion editions.On the movie: I wanted to wring Cecil Kellaway's neck; he's that good. Fredric March was an extremely talented actor whom time has relegated to less-than-top-tier actor status, and I'm not sure why. His performance as the tortured vet in ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" was haunting, and his performance here in screwball comedy was lighter than air. Robert Benchley in the supporting role of best friend was a delight, as usual. I wouldn't be surprised if he wrote most or all of his dialog just as he did for Alfred Hitchcock's ""Foreign Correspondent."" If you aren't a fan of  Veronica Lake, you will be after seeing this film.

The daughter curses Wooley and all his descendants--they will be unhappy in marriage. We see Jonathan is already about to be yoked unhappily to a shrewish Puritan girl who's come to see the witches burn. We also see a vendor selling snacks to the crowd like a hot-dog vendor at a ballpark. The Puritans plant a tree over the witches' grave to keep their spirits from wandering and causing mischief. This doesn't prevent the daughter's spell from ruining the marriages of the Wooley family as we see in a montage.The movie moves forward 270 years to Wallace Wooley (also Frederick March), descendant of Jonathan who is about to be married (unhappily) and be elected governor (his bride-to-be's father is a newspaper owner whose been orchestrating the election). One fundraiser just before the wedding is near where the witches were buried. A lighting storm comes up and strikes the tree. The tree breaks and the two spirits escape. They float over to the party (they're just puffs of smoke) and discuss what is happening (and also the shocking behavior of the modern people--dancing so close and dresses that show arms and backs!). The father says his daughter's curse would be much better if the fellow falls in love with someone else and then marries the shrew.The daughter agrees and they fly off to do the spell that will give her a body. They have to burn a house down as part of the spell, so they burn down the Puritan Hotel. Wallace and his finance are driving back and get caught in traffic caused by the fire. Wallace goes into the hotel because he hears a woman's voice. He finds the witch Jennifer (Veronica Lake) and saves her from the fire. He doesn't recognize she's a witch because...well...the spell only grants her a body, not clothing. He gives her his coat and they escape the building. Romantic entanglements begin!The movie is entertaining with some nice twists and a few contrivances. It isn't super-funny like Bringing Up Baby or It Happened One Night, but is funny enough. The comedy is fairly broad but still works. March and Lake are a fun couple. The special effects are fairly impressive for 1942. The movie is a fine-looking light supernatural comedy.",4,Fun supernatural romantic comedy,1391385600,"02 3, 2014",2014,2325,"['1600s', 'two', 'witches', 'father', 'daughter', 'are', 'be', 'burned', 'stake', 'accusation', 'Puritan', 'Jonathan', 'Wooley', 'Fredrick', 'March', 'daughter', 'Wooley', 'descendants', 'will', 'be', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'see', 'Jonathan', 'already', 'be', 'yoked', 'unhappily', 'shrewish', 'Puritan', 'girl', 'who', 'come', 'see', 'witches', 'burn', 'also', 'see', 'vendor', 'selling', 'snacks', 'crowd', 'hot-dog', 'vendor', 'ballpark', 'Puritans', 'plant', 'tree', 'witches', 'grave', 'keep', 'spirits', 'wandering', 'causing', 'mischief', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'daughter', 'spell', 'ruining', 'marriages', 'Wooley', 'family', 'see', 'montage.The', 'movie', 'forward', '270', 'years', 'Wallace', 'Wooley', 'also', 'Frederick', 'March', 'descendant', 'Jonathan', 'who', 'be', 'married', 'unhappily', 'be', 'elected', 'governor', 'bride-to-be', 'father', 'newspaper', 'owner', 'been', 'orchestrating', 'election', 'One', 'fundraiser', 'just', 'wedding', 'where', 'witches', 'were', 'buried', 'lighting', 'storm', 'up', 'strikes', 'tree', 'tree', 'breaks', 'two', 'spirits', 'escape', 'float', 'party', ""'re"", 'just', 'puffs', 'smoke', 'discuss', 'what', 'happening', 'also', 'shocking', 'behavior', 'modern', 'people', 'dancing', 'so', 'close', 'show', 'arms', 'backs', 'father', 'daughter', 'curse', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'fellow', 'love', 'someone', 'else', 'then', 'shrew.The', 'daughter', 'agrees', 'fly', 'off', 'do', 'spell', 'will', 'give', 'body', 'have', 'burn', 'house', 'down', 'part', 'spell', 'burn', 'down', 'Puritan', 'Hotel', 'Wallace', 'finance', 'are', 'driving', 'back', 'get', 'caught', 'traffic', 'caused', 'fire', 'Wallace', 'hotel', 'woman', 'voice', 'witch', 'Jennifer', 'Veronica', 'Lake', 'fire', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'witch', 'well', 'spell', 'only', 'body', 'not', 'clothing', 'coat', 'escape', 'building', 'Romantic', 'entanglements', 'begin', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'nice', 'twists', 'few', 'contrivances', ""n't"", 'super-funny', 'Bringing', 'Up', 'Baby', 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', 'funny', 'enough', 'comedy', 'fairly', 'broad', 'still', 'March', 'Lake', 'are', 'fun', 'couple', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'fairly', 'impressive', '1942', 'movie', 'fine-looking', 'light', 'supernatural', 'comedy']",I Married a Witch VHS
262503,A1WT96X9NC0D9G,6301706498,"J. Ott ""John Ott""","[0, 0]","Humor is subjective and no doubt there are many who would consider this film funnier than I did. I knew going in that Preston Sturges produced the film, but to me it doesn't measure up to any of the films Sturges wrote and directed. I don't know the filmography of the French director, Ren&eacute; Clair. Apparently he made more experimental films in the 1920's and 30's.This film, however, is a pure Hollywood star vehicle for Veronica Lake and quite successful judged by that criteria. Lake plays a 200+ year old witch who cursed the Wooley family in the Puritan days, only to find herself falling in love with the current Wooley (Frederick March). Her warlock father, meanwhile, wants to continue the curse. All of this spellduggery takes farcical turns as it affects Wooley's impending marriage and his political campaign for state governor. Lake is super-sexy; March and Robert Benchley (playing the best friend) earn some grins as straight men. But in general I was expecting a spoof about sexual mores and politics to have a lot more bite.The setup was better than the execution. Technically, the film is beautifully shot and as usual Criterion makes a fantastic presentation. Not everything is pristine with the print Criterion used. I don't know if that was because they didn't have the budget to search out more pristine elements or if they tried and none better existed. I've certainly seen other studio films from this period in better condition.Historians of fantasy films and old Hollywood visual effects would probably find this film of interest. Clair took a special interest in optical printing and clever practical rigs to create the witchcraft, although most of it is subtle, rather than dazzling. As excellent as the special effects were for their day, they are cheesy by today's standards.The bonus features are pretty light for a Criterion release. There is one very basic archival radio interview with Clair and a more insightful print interview. The essay, by Guy Maddin, is great. And I say this as someone who is not a fan of Mr. Maddin's films. I would have liked to get a feature-length commentary from an old Hollywood historian who could point why exactly, of all the excellent comedies that came out of Hollywood in the early 1940's, this one is worthy of a Criterion treatment.",3,Fun but forgettable,1395878400,"03 27, 2014",2014,2309,"['Humor', 'subjective', 'doubt', 'are', 'many', 'who', 'would', 'consider', 'film', 'funnier', 'did', 'knew', 'going', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'produced', 'film', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'films', 'Sturges', 'wrote', 'directed', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'filmography', 'French', 'director', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Clair', 'Apparently', 'made', 'more', 'experimental', 'films', '1920', ""30's.This"", 'film', 'however', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'vehicle', 'Veronica', 'Lake', 'quite', 'successful', 'judged', 'criteria', 'Lake', '200+', 'year', 'old', 'witch', 'who', 'cursed', 'Wooley', 'family', 'Puritan', 'days', 'only', 'find', 'falling', 'love', 'current', 'Wooley', 'Frederick', 'March', 'warlock', 'father', 'meanwhile', 'continue', 'curse', 'spellduggery', 'farcical', 'turns', 'Wooley', 'impending', 'marriage', 'political', 'campaign', 'state', 'governor', 'Lake', 'super-sexy', 'March', 'Robert', 'Benchley', 'playing', 'best', 'friend', 'earn', 'grins', 'straight', 'men', 'general', 'was', 'expecting', 'spoof', 'sexual', 'mores', 'politics', 'have', 'lot', 'more', 'bite.The', 'setup', 'was', 'better', 'execution', 'Technically', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'usual', 'Criterion', 'fantastic', 'presentation', 'Not', 'everything', 'pristine', 'print', 'Criterion', 'used', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'budget', 'search', 'out', 'more', 'pristine', 'elements', 'tried', 'none', 'better', 'existed', ""'ve"", 'certainly', 'seen', 'other', 'studio', 'films', 'period', 'better', 'condition.Historians', 'fantasy', 'films', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'visual', 'effects', 'would', 'probably', 'find', 'film', 'interest', 'Clair', 'took', 'special', 'interest', 'optical', 'printing', 'clever', 'practical', 'rigs', 'create', 'witchcraft', 'most', 'subtle', 'rather', 'dazzling', 'As', 'excellent', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'day', 'are', 'cheesy', 'today', 'standards.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'pretty', 'light', 'Criterion', 'release', 'one', 'very', 'basic', 'archival', 'radio', 'interview', 'Clair', 'more', 'insightful', 'print', 'interview', 'essay', 'Guy', 'Maddin', 'great', 'say', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'fan', 'Mr.', 'Maddin', 'films', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'get', 'feature-length', 'commentary', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'historian', 'who', 'could', 'point', 'why', 'exactly', 'excellent', 'comedies', 'came', 'Hollywood', 'early', '1940', 'one', 'worthy', 'Criterion', 'treatment']",I Married a Witch VHS

262507,A30TK6U7DNS82R,6301706498,Kevin Killian,"[1, 2]","Cecil Kellaway makes I MARRIED A WITCH a scary film indeed, and I suspect that John Huston must have recalled Kellaway's portrayal when he undertook the role of the evil, incest-driven patriarch in Roman Polanski's CHINATOWN.  Against all odds, Kellaway has kept his daughter to himself for 270 years, thanks to the Puritans who have condemned him to live, as a ghost, in the form of smoke, under a giant oak tree on the ancestral property of the Wooley family.  And in turn Kellaway has cursed the Wooleys, ensuring that, in each generation, no man shall find happiness in love, all will be married to plain battleaxes.Meanwhile Daniel (the warlock played by Kellaway) had Jennifer (his lovely daughter, played by the uniquely talented Veronica Lake) right where he wants her--he's the only man in her universe.  When a lightning storm topples the tree, releasing father and daughter, it spells trouble for Daniel who risks losing the undivided love of his daughter, as, like Miranda in THE TEMPEST, she discovers a brave new world of cute guys and sort of begins to neglect dear old Dad.  Daniel's fury is right out of the Chinatown playbook, and he tries everything he knows to break up Jennifer and her new love interest, Wallace Wooley (Fredric March, looking pretty dumpy only a few years after his killer sex appeal in the Wellman version of A STAR IS BORN).Some will love Veronica Lake, some will be puzzled, but everyone must admit that in her early scenes, before love makes her more ""human,"" she makes some of the oddest acting choices ever captured on film (Surrealist or otherwise).  She employs a squeaky, oltrano voice, as though entrapment in an oak tree for centuries has blanched away her voice to mere oxygen.  In her memoir, Lake told the story of how French director Rene Clair directed her from moment to moment, coaching and acting out her every phrase and expression, every mincing step.  It is a performance more in bits and pieces than a whole, but it is extraordinary nonetheless.  Readers of VERONICA, Lake's memoir, will also recall that she got tired of Freddie March always feeling her up during their scenes together and she arranged a rocking chair scene in which she managed to steer the rocker part right into his most vulnerable area.

It has some funny moments and, for the period, its visual effects are impressive.  The film was probably an inspiration for the popular BEWITCHED television series.In it, Veronica Lake plays a sultry witch.  Centuries after cursing the male descendants of the Salem puritan who sent her to the stake, she finds herself drawn to one of them.  He's a prospective governor (Fredric March), about to marry a spoiled rich girl (Susan Hayward), but Veronica is determined that that marriage will never take place.I know that many people consider I MARRIED A WITCH to be a comedy classic, but I am not one of them.  And, I think that the primary problem with the picture is that the two leads are miscast.Fredric March was one of America's finest dramatic actors, a two-time Academy Award winner.The key word in that previous sentence is ""dramatic,"" because although March did do other comedies during his career (e.g. NOTHING SACRED), comedy was not his forte'.  He did not possess the ""comic touch"".  Indeed, his role in I MARRIED A WITCH called for the deft timing of a Cary Grant or a Fred MacMurray.The same criticism applies to Veronica Lake, a perky actress of limited talent, who was better suited to play second fiddle to actors like Alan Ladd or Joel McCrea.  Hers was a role that needed a Jean Arthur or a Ginger Rogers, both of whom were no stranger to comedy.To make matters even worse, March and Lake have no on-screen chemistry and, according to legend, their off-screen relationship was anything but cordial.On the other hand, I MARRIED A WITCH co-stars comedy veterans Robert Benchley and Cecil Kellaway, and when they are on screen the picture really comes to life.I'm certainly not saying that I MARRIED A WITCH is not entertaining.

Oh, it has some laughs; but it is not up to &#34;madcap comedy&#34; standards. If you want to see what a &#34;madcap comedy&#34; was like, take a look at /His Girl Friday/ or /It Happened One Night/. One problem is that the &#34;finds herself drawn to one of them&#34; suggests that she falls for him all on her own, which might have been more effective, but which is not the case.I don't doubt that this film provided audiences with a welcome diversion at the start of WW II. And it does get a little hectic in spots. But nothing like as hectic as /One, Two, Three/ or /Some Like It Hot/ get.I rented the standard definition video file, so I cannot comment on the DVD or BluRay quality. I can say, however, that many of the Criterions I have purchased over the years on DVD have appeared rather skimpy on extras. This is not a problem as such for me as I don't consider extras to have any economic value, but some Criterion DVDs are priced higher than most DVDs are (not this one, however), and the lack of extras does make them appear skimpy.Still, if you want an older film or a film the studio doesn't want to put out for some reason and it is on Criterion, at least you know you will get a competently done movie. For example, an el-cheapo DVD of /Charade/ that I tried was missing two minutes of film because the owner of the print used had clearly been watching his favorite scenes over and over again until the film broke and they were lost. And what were his favorite scenes? The same as my favorite scenes, and probably yours as well. Still, to be fair, it was letterboxed and (unlike the VHS I replaced it with) had the colors right. I replaced it with the Criterion version and got the entire film. Which, being Criterion, was also letterboxed and also had the colors done correctly, expected.

Veronica Lake's lovely witch ranked very high on that list.  Although she starred in several other classic films from 1942 to 1946, this movie is easily my favorite.  Much of her reputation today is based on her several appearances in film noir classics (THIS GUN FOR HIRE, THE GLASS KEY, and THE BLUE DAHLIA), but I actually preferred her in this film and to a lesser degree SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS.The rest of the cast is just as delightful.  Fredric March is everything you could ask a romantic lead who is descended from Puritans to be, and Cecil Kellaway and Robert Benchley take turns stealing scenes.Of all the European directors forced by political turmoil in Germany and Italy to work in the US temporarily in the thirties and forties, Rene Clair probably had the most successful record.  While his best work remains the extraordinary films he made in the early thirties working in France (SOUS LES TOITS DE PARIS, &Agrave; NOUS LA LIBERT&Eacute;, and, my favorite Clair film, LE MILLION), he nonetheless managed to make some exquisite films both in England (THE GHOST GOES WEST) and the US (IT HAPPENED TOMORROW and the marvelous comic mystery film AND THEN THERE WERE NONE).Much is made of the fact that I MARRIED A WITCH inspired the sixties TV show BEWITCHED, but I think this can be overdone.  BEWITCHED was a situation comedy, whereas I MARRIED A WITCH depends much more on the irony of a witch falling in love with the ancestor of the Puritans who had cursed her a few hundred years before.

Kellaway and his fetching daughter Lake are branded witches in 1690 and condemned to a New England stake. In 1942, Lake comes back to life and marries Fredric March and the results are hilarious! Veronica Lake does amazingly well condsidering she had been in films only a year and Susan Hayward is both pretty and surly at the same time, no small feat of acting. This is indeed a film to keep on video, for it would repeatedly soothe away a wakeful night.  Almost carelessly, it use the most professional means to entrance eye and ear throughout its running time.  It's not the kind of film which requires roars of approving laughter: the occasional quiet chuckle is much more in its line, as it dispenses a delightful sense of oddity and enchantment.  The film's only sin is that it more or less wastes Mr. Benchley, though he has one delightfully confused exit line after light has dawned on him that his friend's wife is really a witch:  &quot;Oh well, it's late, I've got to be getting into my strait jacket. &quot;I'll call a broom&quot;.

262531,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6301706498,Simon Davis,"[63, 65]","It's rare nowadays when you can say that you have seen a totally delightful comedy in the cinemas. That rare marriage of charming scenerio, ideally cast players, and romantic setting seems to be sadly a thing of the past which is why I always find ""I Married a Witch"", such enjoyable viewing. Here we have two very famous performers in dramatic veteran Fredric March, and Film Noir siren Veronica Lake playing against their usual ""type"" and having a field day cutting loose with this romantic screwball tale that combines sexy humour with elements of the supernatural. Based on the unfinished novel by ""Topper"", author Thorne Smith, ""I Married a Witch"", gave us a whole new image of what witches were like minus the warts and crooked nose and in much the same vein as the later legendary series ""Bewitched"", showed us witches who were playful and extremely sexy. Veronica Lake had I feel her most appealing role here and proved herself adept at frothy comedy and capable of far more than just looking slinky hiding behind her famous peek a boo hairstyle. Her chemistry with Fredric March is magical here (no pun intended!), and goes a long way towards making ""I Married a Witch"", the great success it is.Veronica Lake plays a Salem witch who along with her father is burnt at the stake on charges of scorcery. Before her death however she places a curse on the decendants of the man responsible for the burning, one Wallace Wooley. They are all cursed to marry ""unhappily"", and then we are treated to a series of highly amusing ""historical snippets"" showing how each generation of the Wooley family falls victim to the curse with wives they would probably much prefer to see burnt at the stake! The action then moves to the present where we see aspiring political candidate for the State Senate Jonathan Wooley (March) fully involved in the run up to not only his wedding to the hot tempered Estelle (Susan Hayward), daughter of media big shot J.B. Masterson (Robert Warwick), but also the upcoming election financed largely by his overpowering future father in law who is calling the shots in the upcoming election. During a storm  both Jennifer (Veronica Lake), and her no good father Daniel (Cecil Kellaway) are freed from their imprisonment inside the tree that grew on the spot where they were burnt. Jennifer sets out to make life a complete misery for Jonathan during this important time in his life. She tries to create a scandal after Jonathan supposedly ""rescues"" her from a burning building by being ""caught"", in compromising positions in his bedroom right under the nose of both Estelle and disapproving housekeeper Margaret (Elizabeth Patterson). She tries to sabotage Jonathan's wedding day and in an hilarious scene causes a huge wind to come in and literally destroy the whole event. When she pretends to ""die by gunshot"", in an adjoining room causing an even bigger scandal which will set Jonathan up on a murder charge Jennifer however gets more than she bargained for. Earlier she had concocted a potion that will make Jonathan fall in love with her, Jonathan now accidently uses it to revive Jennifer and she finds herself madly in love with him! Fed up with Estelle's rages and her greedy father planning his every move Jonathan begins to realise that the disorder and excitement that Jennifer has brought into his  ordered existence right down to flying through the air in a car, has revitalised him and love blossoms. When Jennifer's menacing and perpetually drunk father sees the change in her and threatens to take the families revenge out on Jonathan himself he takes Jennifer's powers away from him and ends up back in the bottle that will be his home for all eternity. We then see a flash forward to when Jonathan and Jennifer are a comfortably married middle aged couple and the witch streak is still there when their daughter begins feeling ""right at home"",playing with a broomstick.This slapstick piece of Americana was ably handled by none other than French director Rene Clair who really produced his best work during the 1930's before leaving Europe in the wake of Nazi aggression. Here however he seems totally at home with his rapid fire direction and rarely has a director got a more lively and delightfully kittenish performance out of Veronica Lake than Rene Clair does here. Fredric March and Lake combine extremely well here despite the very public clashes they had on the set during filming. Indeed March has rarely been more pleasing on screen where he is normally associated with such diverse dramatic roles as in ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", ""A Star is Born"", and ""The Best Years of Our Lives"". He brings a frustratingly frantic skill to his acting that makes Lake's cool and deliciously wicked playing of this sexy witch seem even more amusing. Cecil Kellaway almost succeeds in stealing every scene he is in as the permanently drunk father of Lake and Susan Hayward, an actress I greatly admire has a quite difficult character to play here that nevertheless indicated what she was capable of delivering in later better roles. For 1942 the magical special effects are first rate where we have scenes of Jennifer and her father's disembodied presences in the form of smoke going inside bottles etc. First rate all the way for this time.Often passed off as the inspiration for the TV series ""Bewitched"", we will never know for sure if that was indeed the case. What we do know is that in ""I Married a Witch"", we are in possession of a delightfully  wicked little comedy that crosses many sexual boundaries that might not have been gotten away with elsewhere at this time. For those viewers only used to seeing Veronica Lake as Alan Ladd's costar in numerous glossy Film Noirs do yourself a favour and check out her bewitchingly delightful performance opposite Fredric March in Rene Clair's ""I Married a Witch"".

Veronica Lake is well cast, but the direction makes them all look like amateurs, including the support of Robert Benchley.

Comes our time, the evil spirits are released by a lightning strike, and the witch adds to her curse by making the present descdendant love her as she spites him.  But, she drinks the potion by accident.  Her judgmental father must punish her for loving a mortal, but she tricks him into a bottle of rum that she will keep corked.
