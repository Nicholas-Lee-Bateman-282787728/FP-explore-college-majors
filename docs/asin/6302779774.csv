I've always liked Brian Dennehy (In Broad Daylight)and Joanne Woodword (Three Faces of Eve). In this movie they get to show off some comedic talents but the movie is also a drama. Joanne and Brian meet on a flight to England, and Joanne, tries to ignore Brian who she finds annoying. Later on they meet while in England and Joanne keeps trying to avoid Brian, but eventually she gets to know him and realizes what a nice guy he is. The movie has some funny parts and some sad, but always interesting. I hope a film studio see this movie and release it on DVD. They put it on VHS, and need to put it on DVD. Its better than a lot of junky movies you see on DVD.",5,Why didn't they release this good movie on DVD?,1279929600,"07 24, 2010",2010,750,"['Made', '1993', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'wish', 'would', 'release', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'Broad', 'Daylight', 'Joanne', 'Woodword', 'Three', 'Faces', 'Eve', 'movie', 'get', 'show', 'off', 'comedic', 'talents', 'movie', 'also', 'drama', 'Joanne', 'Brian', 'meet', 'flight', 'England', 'Joanne', 'ignore', 'Brian', 'who', 'annoying', 'Later', 'meet', 'England', 'Joanne', 'trying', 'avoid', 'Brian', 'eventually', 'know', 'realizes', 'what', 'nice', 'guy', 'movie', 'funny', 'parts', 'sad', 'always', 'interesting', 'hope', 'film', 'studio', 'see', 'movie', 'release', 'DVD', 'put', 'VHS', 'need', 'put', 'DVD', 'better', 'lot', 'junky', 'movies', 'see', 'DVD']",N/A
