330606,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,6302732964,A Customer,"[3, 3]","Beautfully acted with a stunning cast, the 1949 movie The Letter to Three Wives is part sharp social satire and part relationship drama with a hardnosed and cunning woman at the heart of the story. The big surprise is that you never really see this woman. Addie Ross (voiced by Celeste Holm) has a huge impact on the lives of the movie's three main protagonists Deborah Bishop (Jeanne Crain), Rita Phipps (Ann Sothern) and the stunning Lora Mae Hollingsway (Linda Darnell).Insecure in they're marriages, yet truly loving their husbands, the three women are about to embark in a bucolic afternoon chaperoning a children's boating expedition. Just as they are about to board the ship, a messenger sends them a letter from their mutual friend Addie Ross, written to tell them that she is running away with one of their husbands - but she hesitates to say which one.Powerless to get to a telephone and try to contact their husbands - as they watch the phone booth gradually disappearing into the distance - the three women end up spending much of the boat trip reflecting on their marriages in an effort to determine if their husbands have sufficient reason to leave them. The story is told in a series of flashbacks, with each woman given ample time to lay out the case for their respective husbands' infidelity.Deborah (Crain) is the young and unsophisticated farm girl who feels out-of-place amongst her husband Brad's (Jeffrey Lynn) rich and cosmopolitan friends. At an engagement she gets rotten drunk and makes a fool of herself and then gets paranoid when she sees Brad gushing up to Addie.Likewise, the irascible Rita (Phipps) is far too concerned with making a good impression for her overbearing boss (Florence Bates) and it cuts severely into the time she can give her schoolteacher husband George (Kirk Douglas) and their children. An over worked writer for radio programs, Rita is so preoccupied with getting an upcoming dinner party right, that she forgets George's birthday. Addie Ross doesn't, and she makes sure George remembers her by sending him a special addition of a Brahms record collection.And then there's the gorgeous Lora Mae (Darnell) who works as a secretarial assistance for the wealthy refrigerator magnate Porter (Paul Douglas) and ends up marrying him because he wants to have a life in a gilded frame just like the picture Porter has of Addie Ross. Now they spend their days constantly bickering and squabbling - Porter thinks Lora Mae married him for his money, whilst she is convinced that he doesn't love her.Director Joe Mankiewicz uses all his talents to great effect in this movie, and using the flashback stucture, he really offers up some tart and sophisticated observations on society and class and manages to convey the vulnerabilties of these women - and perhaps also their severe case of self denial. Of course, the big surprise is who did Addie Ross actually run off with, was it Brad, George or Porter?The themes of the movie are obviously trust and loyalty and the roles of men and women in marriage, which I guess were quite relevant for the time - the roles of women were increasingly changing and this is no doubt reflected in the way these women relate to their husbands. Deborah, Rita and Lora Mae are enviable women and they all have marriages that perhaps some women could only dream of. This makes it all the more sardonic when they receive Addie Ross's letter; and it's as though she sending them up, even testing them.A Letter to Three Wives is a witty, intelligent film that demands attention from the viewer. Many of the scenes - especially in the flashback sequences are driven by the arch, literate dialogue and you really have to concentrate to fully comprehend the back story for each woman.Perhaps one of the niftiest techniques is to have Addie commenting on the action with a type of sly and ironic detachment. Although we never see her, her presence is always felt, she's not only a catalyst for the acton, but also an unseen presence in her friends marriages, a type of rival who ultimately contributes to their feelings of insecurity.

But substitute ""television"" for radio and make that steam engine on the commuter run a diesel, and have things really changed that much since the late Forties?This gem of a movie is a neglected classic of Americana. ""A Letter to Three Wives"" uses many of the same talents who made ""All About Eve"" such a hit a year later, most notably Joseph L. Mankiewicz as the writer/director and Celeste Holm, who is present here in voice only as Addie Ross, the town flirt.Just as three of the town's more prominent clubwomen are about to depart on a day-long trip with underprivileged children, they receive a note from Addie--she has run off with one of their husbands. They have the whole day to think about which one it was. The Jeanne Crain character is insecure because she left her Iowa roots and married up to one of the town gentry. The Linda Darnell character was ""shanty Irish"" and married a department store millionaire with whom she shares a rather grudging relationship. Ann Sothern plays a radio screenwriter who is trying to maneuver her way out of the second-best neighborhood in town into the very best.Along with sharp observations about class and social climbing in small towns/suburbia, this film has well-cast, spot-on acting and many genuinely funny moments, including a star turn from Kirk Douglas as a droll English teacher (bet you thought you'd never see HIM in a comedy!). Look for the wonderful (and surprisingly unbilled) Thelma Ritter as the maid from the wrong side of the tracks.

The all-star cast, insightful writing, and the use of a cleverly haunting voice-over make this a treasure.  Long before their modern day counterparts on ABC, these three magnificent women were truly desperate housewives.A mutual friend they all are a bit jealous of has a letter delivered to them as they are setting sail for a day trip.  The letter informs all three that the writer, Addie Ross, has left town with one of their husbands.  In wickedly funny and poignant flashbacks, each of the three marriages, all in a state of relative degeneration, are sliced open as the viewer speculates as to which husband has taken a hike.Deborah Bishop (Jeanne Crain) is a transplanted farm girl unsure of how to dress and act in the social realm her marriage has thrust her into.  Has her husband Brad (Jeffrey Lynn) found her inadequate?  Lora Mae Hollingsway (Linda Darnell) is an unabashedly scheming gold-digger who makes no apologies to husband Porter (Paul Douglas). Has he run off with a woman who can truly love him and not his money? But it is the savvy career girl Rita Phipps (Ann Sothern) that I found most appealing as she is willing to work for the things she wants and, unusual for her day, takes a job writing radio soap operas to supplement the income of husband George (Kirk Douglas).  Has she emasculated him to the point he can no longer take it?Yes, there are parts of this that are dated---most notably the longing in their eyes as they set sail gazing wistfully at a phone booth on shore.  No cell phones for these ladies!  But the problems they reveal in their marriages, the compassionate friendship they share, and the wickedly funny use of comedy side-by-side with drama, all combine to make this the ultimate chick flick.

330615,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6302732964,Byron Kolln,"[3, 3]","Joseph L. Mankiewicz's 1949 character drama A LETTER TO THREE WIVES provides a tour-de-force showcase for three outstanding female stars, and illustrates a timeless dilemma that most every married woman has considered at least once during her marriage...On their way to chaperone a childrens' picnic, girlfriends Deborah Bishop (Jeanne Crain), Rita Phipps (Ann Sothern) and Lora Mae Hollingsway (Linda Darnell) receive a mysterious letter - addressed to all of them - in which local good-time gal Addie Ross reveals that she has left town, and taken one of their husbands with her!  Too late to call off their involvement with the picnic and return home to uncover the truth, the ladies spend quiet moments to themselves, and try to recall incidents that might have caused rifts in their marriages...Deborah remembers the night that husband Brad (Jeffrey Lynn) first introduced her to Rita, Lora Mae, and their close circle of friends.  The insecure farmgirl originally joined the Navy in an attempt to launch herself into the great big world outside, never entertaining the notion that she'd net a husband out of it.  She drowns her fears in a series of martinis, puts on her only ""fancy"" gown, and later embarrasses herself on the Country Club dance-floor when her dress performs a wardrobe malfunction.Career-minded Rita casts her thoughts back to the night when she pushed hubby George's (Kirk Douglas) birthday celebration out of the window in order to host a dinner party for two ill-mannered radio executives.  And Lora Mae recalls her blue-collar beginnings in the small trackside house that she shared with her mother and sister, where millionaire Porter Hollingsway (Paul Douglas) plucked up his earnest employee for a glamorous life of leisure.One husband has now left the picture.  As the three ladies re-assemble at the Country Club with their partners, the truth will be revealed, but not before one final twist to the puzzle...I'll never comprehend exactly *how* screenwriter Joseph L. Mankiewicz was able to probe so deeply into the female psyche, and write two screenplays that seem to precisely echo the fears, insecurities and longings that are universal for every woman.  ""All About Eve"", and most especially A LETTER TO THREE WIVES still stand up remarkably well in their depiction of strong women who still aren't afraid to explore their inner fears and failings.Darnell, Crain and Sothern are all outstanding in the lead roles.  Sothern, I believe, comes off best with some of Mankiewicz's snappiest dialogue.  Little wonder that Ms Sothern later fared so brilliantly in the world of sitcom television.  Ms Darnell is fascinating as Lora Mae.  At this time, Darnell had successfully graduated within the ranks of Fox from sweet ingenue roles in ""Day-Time Wife"" and ""Mark of Zorro"" to harder-edged characters like jaded concubine Tuptim in ""Anna and the King of Siam"".  As Lora Mae, Ms Darnell brings us a truly complex young woman whose clearly not your standard gold-digging dummy.  Jeanne Crain, it's reported, wasn't well-liked by Mankiewicz; but Fox producer Darryl Zanuck had been grooming Ms Crain since she first arrived on the lot, personally supervising her casting in such box-office hits as ""State Fair"", and had in fact originally earmarked Crain for the title role in ""All About Eve"" (this never materialised, probably for obvious reasons!).  Nevertheless she is charming as Deborah.The character of Addie Ross, the woman who triggers the internal drama for the three women, is truly an enigma throughout the film.  Despite the fact that we never actually see her (we almost do in one tantalising frame), she permeates every second of the film, ala Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"".

Just before the boat leaves the dock a messenger arrives with a note for the three of them. It's from Addie Ross, an old friend who may not be much of a friend. ""Dearest Debby, Lora Mae and Rita,"" she writes. ""As you know, by now, you'll have to carry on without me from here. It isn't easy to leave a town like our town, to tear myself away from you three dear, dear friends who have meant so much to me. And so I consider myself lucky to be able to take with me a sort of memento, something to remind me of the town that was my home, and of my three very dearest friends, who I never want to forget, and I won't. You see, girls, I've run off with one of your husbands. Addie"" For the next few hours, unable to get to a telephone, each of the three women can only reflect back on her marriage and wonder if she is the one who has just lost her husband. Only that afternoon when they return will they learn which husband Addie made off with.There's Deborah Bishop (Jeanne Crain) married to Brad (Jeffrey Lynn). She was a small town girl swept away by a glamorous officer, who now lives a life of country club complacency. She has never lost her insecurity. There's Rita Phipps (Ann Southern) married to George (Kirk Douglas). She and her husband started out as school teachers. He still is but she is carving a successful and well-paid career as a radio soap opera writer. There's Lora Mae Hollingsway (Linda Darnell) married to Porter (Paul Douglas). She wanted away from the other side of the tracks, and managed to make a marriage happen with the town's biggest businessman.As they flash back, we learn a lot about each one of them and the state of their marriages. Hovering over everything is the presence of Addie. ""That's Addie, for you,"" gushes Brad at one moment. ""Always the right thing at the right time. Thoughtful and generous."" ""Generous to a fault,"" agrees George. ""To a fault. That's Addie,"" say Rita, making a face. We never meet Addie, never even see her, but she keeps up a voice-over commentary with us that is amusing, a little malicious and wise about the ways of husbands.By the end of the movie the three couples have learned a good deal about themselves and what's important. Addie indeed had run off with one of the husbands. And nonetheless the movie has a happy and satisfying ending.Many critics think this is Joseph Mankiewicz' best movie after All About Eve. He won Oscars for best screenplay and best direction (and then repeated the next year for Eve). There are any number of good things about the film. The situation could have degenerated into melodrama but Mankiewicz' writing is so amusing and sophisticated it raises the game. It crackles with commentary on any number of issues, and most are still pertinent today. ""I'm a school teacher,"" George Phipps says. ""That's even worse than being an intellectual. School teachers are not only comic they're often cold and hungry in this richest land of ours."" Try substituting ""television writing"" for ""radio writing"" and hear the zingers snap home as George offends a radio advertising executive. ""The purpose of radio writing,"" he says, ""as far as I can see is to prove to the 'masses' that a deodorant can bring happiness, a mouthwash guarantee success and a laxative attract romance."" Mankiewicz' brief satire of a radio soap opera, ""Another Day in the Notebook of Linda Grey, Registered Nurse,"" is almost as good as some of Bob and Ray's stuff.All the actors do fine jobs, but particularly appealing, I think, are Ann Southern as Rita, Linda Darnell as Lora Mae and Paul Douglas as Porter. Unbilled and stealing scenes is Thelma Ritter as the Phipps' maid. Also unbilled but a key element in the movie is Celeste Holm. She does Addie's voice...warm, low pitched, amused, and not to be trusted if you're a wife.The black and white DVD looks great.

330625,A23UB49EG29MVT,6302732964,Commenter77,"[2, 2]","This is an interesting and thoughtful movie - well done with absorbing stories. I think it was effectively tied together with quality characters and portrayals.  It's not a comedy. Life has its humor as you go along, but there's more serious business going on here, and it is handled as such.Ann Sothern seemed to step up in this role. Isn't this the strongest production for her? She's always been a B movie player, to my observation. She brightened up anything she was in, even very low productions. I think she did this very well, and could have done more at this level. She is strong and thoroughly attractive, inside and out.Kirk Douglas has some strong scenes in this early role. He did seem too young for Ann Sothern, but no deal breaker.  I liked his character, who effectively stood up to his strong wife about the compromise in her writing. They were the soundest couple of the three.Have never understood Paul Douglas as a leading man. To me, he's downright unattractive. Good actor maybe, but not believable as a sought after bachelor.  In this case, the beautiful, young but poor girl is out to snag a rich guy, and that is accomplished for that obvious reason. But that the famed, beautiful and affluent Addie Ross would want to run off with him stretches the imagination.Linda Darnell is of course quite beautiful and I thought very competent in this. The character had an interesting and disciplined system for her pursuit of a man who would get her out of the railroad flat. Understandable. Some have labeled her character a floozy.  How so?  She operated from home and took her mother out with her when she married. She didn't compromise herself in the pursuit, just beat the man at his game, which was to use them and lose them. Should she have been another of his casualties? Of course, neither are very secure in their marriage, given their shaky foundation. But there comes an effective reckoning with their respective motivations through the Addie experience.Jeanne Crain is an insecure wife here. Her character was a mess, having to be propped up by everyone around her, but grows and stabilizes.  Jeffrey Lynn plays her busy traveling husband. Wish more would have been done with him. He's one of those really attractive people who don't work out somehow. That's more what a leading man should look like, but guess the performances didn't come up. Loved him in ""Four Daughters,"" admittedly a lesser film. But would have liked to have seen him more. Wish he could have been like Lee Bowman, the good looking other man used in about every third film made in his era. I would have been right there ogling ... lolConnie Gilchrist and Thelma Ritter are super treats. I don't know what shakes up that kitchen more, the local coming through or all that snappy dialog. Great character players, always effective.  It surprised me to find that this was Ritter's first or near first role, being uncredited here.  Florence Bates should be mentioned also, always good.I find this an engrossing movie that survives its period and doesn't disappoint, either as it goes along or as it wraps up.

330628,A1TJRWJ7C7F9MX,6302732964,dean59,"[0, 0]","My review title is really--and deliberately--a contradiction in terms, but ""A Letter to Three Wives"" is a movie that manages to resolve the contradiction. I've watched it I don't know how many times (most recently, yesterday) and I know I'll watch it many more times, with just as much enjoyment. It has the feel of reading a good, absorbing book on a rainy day with a blanket thrown over you. This is not the tone one expects from a satire (on postwar suburbia, in this case), and that is arguably a limitation, but not one that bothers me at all when I'm viewing it.The performances are uniformly good, with extraordinary care taken in the casting, from the stars to a delivery boy on the screen for less than a minute. The pacing is perfect and the dialogue never less than bright, often witty. And how that ""she's being penetrated"" line (happily) got past the 1948 censors is beyond me. Especially with Kirk Douglas' follow up comment, it's so unsubtle that it's barely a double entendre; closer to a single.As far as the satire goes, it is fairly gentle. The most interestingly sharp observation is of how, in a small suburban town, a schoolteacher and his radio writer wife, along with a girl from the wrong side of the tracks who happens to marry a rich man, can be securely accepted into the country club set, when in Manhattan, for example, you wouldn't find the teacher and his wife in the club at all, and the rich man's wife would be frozen out in a long period of probation, at the least. Those of us who grew up in similar environments know this is accurate; my middle class family's best friend growing up was a Hollywood screenwriter my parents never would have met if we lived in nearby Los Angeles, and my mom, herself a teacher, worked alongside and became and remained close friends with another teacher married to a multi-millionaire.I make all my friends (many of whom think B&W; movies are stone age relics belonging in museums behind glass) watch this movie at some point; I can only encourage anyone reading this to do so.",4,Comfortable Satire,1383609600,"11 5, 2013",2013,2047,"['review', 'title', 'really', 'deliberately', 'contradiction', 'terms', 'Letter', 'Three', 'Wives', 'movie', 'resolve', 'contradiction', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'most', 'recently', 'yesterday', 'know', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'many', 'more', 'times', 'just', 'much', 'enjoyment', 'feel', 'reading', 'good', 'absorbing', 'book', 'rainy', 'day', 'blanket', 'thrown', 'not', 'tone', 'one', 'satire', 'postwar', 'suburbia', 'case', 'arguably', 'limitation', 'not', 'one', 'when', ""'m"", 'viewing', 'it.The', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'good', 'extraordinary', 'care', 'taken', 'casting', 'stars', 'delivery', 'boy', 'screen', 'less', 'minute', 'pacing', 'perfect', 'dialogue', 'never', 'less', 'bright', 'often', 'witty', 'how', 'being', 'penetrated', 'line', 'happily', 'got', '1948', 'censors', 'Especially', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'follow', 'up', 'comment', 'so', 'unsubtle', 'barely', 'double', 'entendre', 'closer', 'single.As', 'far', 'satire', 'fairly', 'gentle', 'most', 'interestingly', 'sharp', 'observation', 'how', 'small', 'suburban', 'town', 'schoolteacher', 'radio', 'writer', 'wife', 'girl', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'who', 'marry', 'rich', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'securely', 'accepted', 'country', 'club', 'set', 'when', 'Manhattan', 'example', 'would', ""n't"", 'find', 'teacher', 'wife', 'club', 'rich', 'man', 'wife', 'would', 'be', 'frozen', 'out', 'long', 'period', 'probation', 'least', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'similar', 'environments', 'know', 'accurate', 'middle', 'class', 'family', 'best', 'friend', 'growing', 'up', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriter', 'parents', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'met', 'lived', 'nearby', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'mom', 'teacher', 'worked', 'alongside', 'became', 'remained', 'close', 'friends', 'teacher', 'married', 'multi-millionaire.I', 'make', 'friends', 'many', 'whom', 'think', 'B', 'W', 'movies', 'are', 'stone', 'age', 'relics', 'belonging', 'museums', 'glass', 'watch', 'movie', 'point', 'can', 'only', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'reading', 'do', 'so']",N/A

330632,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,6302732964,Douglas M,"[2, 5]","Joseph Mankiewicz had been a writer in Hollywood since the early thirties and he always wrote witty often cynical screenplays. By the late forties, he was given the opportunity to direct his scripts following the lead of Preston Sturges and others, thereby enabling him to ensure that his ideas were preserved as written. This is a very entertaining film with a great script which still works today. The plot covers the story of 3 woman who are forced to review their marriages when they learn that the town siren has run off with one of their husbands. As a director, Mankiewicz is good, but it is the writing which really counts. The screenplay of this film is filled with hilarious one liners and cynical barbs on the American way of life. It really has not dated a bit.I am surprised so many reviewers single out the Paul Douglas/Linda Darnell sequence though. For my money, the Anne Sothern/Kirk Douglas sequence is the best, if only because Ann Sothern was so much better an actress than Linda Darnell, Kirk Douglas is surprisingly modest and convincing, Thelma Ritter is hilarious and the satire on radio really bites. In fact, Thelma Ritter steals every scene she appears in but everyone is good. Paul Douglas is perfect in his film debut and Jeanne Crain is perfectly cast as the mouse. This is a great ensemble cast each with an opportunity to shine.The DVD print of the film is excellent preserving that magnificent Fox photography and lighting. There is also a Biography Program of Linda Darnell. Poor tragic Darnell. She never really could eliminate an artificial quality to her acting, even here when she is at her best. Although she undoubtedly had a beautiful face, she sadly was an alcoholic and often looked slightly bloated to me. The DVD contains a first rate commentary, one of the commentators being the director's son who discreetly neglects to mention that his father had a long affair with Darnell at the time the film was made.",4,Clever script and good fun,1126310400,"09 10, 2005",2005,1953,"['Joseph', 'Mankiewicz', 'had', 'been', 'writer', 'Hollywood', 'early', 'thirties', 'always', 'wrote', 'witty', 'often', 'cynical', 'screenplays', 'late', 'forties', 'was', 'given', 'opportunity', 'direct', 'scripts', 'following', 'lead', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'others', 'thereby', 'enabling', 'ensure', 'ideas', 'were', 'preserved', 'written', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'great', 'script', 'still', 'today', 'plot', 'story', '3', 'woman', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'review', 'marriages', 'when', 'learn', 'town', 'siren', 'run', 'off', 'one', 'husbands', 'director', 'Mankiewicz', 'good', 'writing', 'really', 'screenplay', 'film', 'filled', 'hilarious', 'one', 'liners', 'cynical', 'barbs', 'American', 'way', 'life', 'really', 'not', 'dated', 'bit.I', 'am', 'surprised', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'single', 'Paul', 'Douglas/Linda', 'Darnell', 'sequence', 'though', 'money', 'Anne', 'Sothern/Kirk', 'Douglas', 'sequence', 'best', 'only', 'Ann', 'Sothern', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'actress', 'Linda', 'Darnell', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'surprisingly', 'modest', 'convincing', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'hilarious', 'satire', 'radio', 'really', 'fact', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'steals', 'scene', 'everyone', 'good', 'Paul', 'Douglas', 'perfect', 'film', 'debut', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'mouse', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'opportunity', 'shine.The', 'DVD', 'print', 'film', 'excellent', 'preserving', 'magnificent', 'Fox', 'photography', 'lighting', 'also', 'Biography', 'Program', 'Linda', 'Darnell', 'Poor', 'tragic', 'Darnell', 'never', 'really', 'could', 'eliminate', 'artificial', 'quality', 'acting', 'even', 'here', 'when', 'best', 'undoubtedly', 'had', 'beautiful', 'face', 'sadly', 'was', 'alcoholic', 'often', 'looked', 'slightly', 'bloated', 'DVD', 'first', 'rate', 'commentary', 'one', 'commentators', 'being', 'director', 'son', 'who', 'discreetly', 'mention', 'father', 'had', 'long', 'affair', 'Darnell', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made']",N/A

Taylor ""GFT""","[36, 38]","Jeanne Crain was a very pretty girl, Ann Sothern was chiefly noted for her comic turns, and Linda Darnell was a memorable beauty--but although all three appeared in popular films none were particularly celebrated for their acting talents until Joseph L. Mankiewicz tapped them for the roles of three society wives in this poison pen letter to both sexes.  Wickedly witty in script, and remarkably acid in tone, A LETTER TO THREE WIVES would put every one involved in the film firmly on the Hollywood map.Three society wives (Crain, Sothern, and Darnell) are committed to hosting a children's picnic on an isolated island--and as the ferry prepares to depart they receive a letter from town femme fatale Addie Ross (never seen but memorably voiced by Celeste Holm.)  Addie informs them that she is leaving town forever... but has decided to take one of their husbands along as a memento.  And each of the three wives, cut off from the outside world for the day, is left to wonder: when I go home tonight, will my husband still be there?During the day each of the wives recalls scenes from her marriage.  Deborah (Craine) arrived in town as a pretty but very awkward farm girl fresh out of the navy and with a wardrobe consisting of a single and very ugly mail-order dress; she has never felt entirely secure.  Rita (Sothern) is married to a schoolteacher, and has committed the unpardonable sin of becoming the writer of a popular radio show that brings her more money than her husband will ever earn.  And Lora Mae (Darnell) was a beauty born on the wrong side of the tracks who connived her way into a wealthy marriage and now specializes in bickering with her gruff and boorish husband.  And always they have been victim to Addie--a woman who &quot;has class,&quot; who stings them with competition and evil wit, and who has their husbands eating out of her hand.Although the construction is artificial, the script is wickedly knowing, painting a truly subversive vision of American marriage and mores of the late 1940s.  Of the three leads, Ann Sothern dominates with her spirited &quot;Rita&quot;--but Darnell has the best of the script, a series of manipulations and drop-dead quips and ripostes, and Crain is perfectly cast as the insecure beauty who is as out of place as a dove at a gathering of eagles.  The supporting cast, which includes Kirk Douglas, Thelma Ritter, and Connie Gilchrist is remarkably fine as well.  And before all is said and done, small town society gets raked over coals.If A LETTER TO THREE WIVES has a flaw, it is the same flaw that would trouble Mankiewicz's later and even more celebrated ALL ABOUT EVE: the point of view that a woman is ultimately nothing without a man, an idea that tends to limit the scope of the film and at times even belittle its characters.  Some viewers may also be disappointed with the film's conclusion, which--although extremely ironic--lacks the sharp bite you might expect.  Even so, this is a truly memorable and often very funny film, and one that deserves to be seen more often today than it usually is.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,"Sharp, Funny, and Socially Savage",1073520000,"01 8, 2004",2004,3092,"['Jeanne', 'Crain', 'was', 'very', 'pretty', 'girl', 'Ann', 'Sothern', 'was', 'chiefly', 'noted', 'comic', 'turns', 'Linda', 'Darnell', 'was', 'memorable', 'beauty', 'three', 'appeared', 'popular', 'films', 'none', 'were', 'particularly', 'celebrated', 'acting', 'talents', 'Joseph', 'L.', 'Mankiewicz', 'tapped', 'roles', 'three', 'society', 'wives', 'poison', 'pen', 'letter', 'sexes', 'Wickedly', 'witty', 'script', 'remarkably', 'acid', 'tone', 'A', 'LETTER', 'TO', 'THREE', 'WIVES', 'would', 'put', 'one', 'involved', 'film', 'firmly', 'Hollywood', 'map.Three', 'society', 'wives', 'Crain', 'Sothern', 'Darnell', 'are', 'committed', 'hosting', 'children', 'picnic', 'isolated', 'island', 'ferry', 'depart', 'receive', 'letter', 'town', 'femme', 'fatale', 'Addie', 'Ross', 'never', 'seen', 'memorably', 'voiced', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'Addie', 'informs', 'leaving', 'town', 'forever', 'decided', 'take', 'one', 'husbands', 'memento', 'three', 'wives', 'cut', 'off', 'outside', 'world', 'day', 'left', 'wonder', 'when', 'go', 'home', 'tonight', 'will', 'husband', 'still', 'be', 'there', 'day', 'wives', 'recalls', 'scenes', 'marriage', 'Deborah', 'Craine', 'arrived', 'town', 'pretty', 'very', 'awkward', 'farm', 'girl', 'fresh', 'navy', 'wardrobe', 'consisting', 'single', 'very', 'ugly', 'mail-order', 'dress', 'never', 'felt', 'entirely', 'secure', 'Rita', 'Sothern', 'married', 'schoolteacher', 'committed', 'unpardonable', 'sin', 'becoming', 'writer', 'popular', 'radio', 'show', 'more', 'money', 'husband', 'will', 'ever', 'earn', 'Lora', 'Mae', 'Darnell', 'was', 'beauty', 'born', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'who', 'connived', 'way', 'wealthy', 'marriage', 'now', 'bickering', 'gruff', 'boorish', 'husband', 'always', 'have', 'been', 'victim', 'Addie', 'woman', 'who', 'quot', 'class', 'quot', 'who', 'competition', 'evil', 'wit', 'who', 'husbands', 'eating', 'hand.Although', 'construction', 'artificial', 'script', 'wickedly', 'knowing', 'painting', 'truly', 'subversive', 'vision', 'American', 'marriage', 'mores', 'late', '1940s', 'three', 'leads', 'Ann', 'Sothern', 'spirited', 'quot', 'Rita', 'quot', 'Darnell', 'best', 'script', 'series', 'manipulations', 'drop-dead', 'quips', 'ripostes', 'Crain', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'insecure', 'beauty', 'who', 'place', 'dove', 'gathering', 'eagles', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'Connie', 'Gilchrist', 'remarkably', 'fine', 'well', 'said', 'done', 'small', 'town', 'society', 'raked', 'coals.If', 'A', 'LETTER', 'TO', 'THREE', 'WIVES', 'flaw', 'same', 'flaw', 'would', 'trouble', 'Mankiewicz', 'later', 'even', 'more', 'celebrated', 'ABOUT', 'EVE', 'point', 'view', 'woman', 'ultimately', 'nothing', 'man', 'idea', 'limit', 'scope', 'film', 'times', 'even', 'belittle', 'characters', 'viewers', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'conclusion', 'extremely', 'ironic', 'sharp', 'bite', 'might', 'expect', 'Even', 'so', 'truly', 'memorable', 'often', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'one', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'often', 'today', 'usually', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

In short, it is a film written and directed by an adult aimed at adults. &quot;Three Wives&quot; examines, with wit to spare, the importance placed on money, class distinction, and what women had/still have to deal with concerning the opposite sex, with a couple of jabs at entertainment,advertising, and consumerism thrown in for good measure.  All of the performances are excellent, with a remarkable performance by the gorgeous Linda Darnell as a gold-digging dish (with a heart of gold) from the other side of the tracks. Also present are Connie Gilchrist and an unbilled Thelma Ritter,whose presence in a film always guaranteed howls of laughter. (Her roles were written with her in mind, by the way) &quot;Three Wives&quot; was unnecessarily remade, without the wit or charm, into a made-for-TV movie in the late 1980s, its only redeeming quality being Ann Sothern, one of the original &quot;Three Wives&quot; played a small role in it.

I was very surprised.  This is an incredibly well-written, clever, sophisticated and insightful film that compares the marriages of three archetypal women who have made it to the upper middle class.  One got there by being pretty, but fears she doesn't belong because she's a farm girl.  One got there by taking a job that pays more than her husband's teaching gig.  And one got there by making her (older) boss so frustrated by her unavailability he finally marries her.All three husbands seem to have been in love with a woman who remains a fantasy figure to us--Addie Ross.  We see her hand holding a cigarette on a balcony, a silver frame with her picture lovingly placed atop a piano, and a precious gift of a rare LP. All three wives assume their husbands would leave them for Addie given a chance, as they assess themselves critically and worry about whether they are worthy of their husband's love. It might sound politically suspect in our decade, but the portraits of the women are so three-dimensional, showing them to be far more substantial than they give themselves credit for being--that's really the joke of the movie. They don't like themselves as much as their husbands like them.This story is told with great intelligence.  The structure of the screenplay is unique and effective.  The dialogue is amazing; sharp, funny, penetrating.  The film was written by Joseph L. Manckiewicz, who later wrote ""All About Eve,"" an acknowledged classic.  This one deserves equal billing, and I think I might like it a little better.  It is not as well cast as ""Eve""--that's probably the only reason it isn't as well known.

A letter is delivered to 3 women just as they are about to take a group of school children on a day-excursion on a riverboat. The letter is from a woman named Addie Ross, who is never seen in the film but whose ""voice-over"" is done by Celeste Holm. The letter says that Addie has run off with one of their husbands. The rest of the film is divided into 3 ""episodes"" wherein each woman ruminates on her life with her husband and whether it could be her husband that Addie has stolen. The movie is full of the sort of wonderful dialogue and funny/barbed satire that Mankiewicz excelled in. Darnell and Sothern are very good in this film and Kirk Douglas has some of the best lines in the movie as Sothern's husband. Paul Douglas makes his film debut playing Darnell's husband.

The cast with includes Linda Darnell, Ann Southern, Kirk Douglas, Jeanne Crain, and the always marvelous Thelma Ritter are great, but it is doubtful they would be as good without the incredible script by Joseph L. Mankiewicz who also directed it.For me, this movie should be shown on a double bill with The Best Years of Our Lives since it sums up so many aspects of the immediate post-war period and almost exists as a marvelous historical document of the concerns and day to anxieties of the period. That so many of these same concerns exist today also makes it still relevent.The movie follows the concerns of three upper middle class couples all of whom are dealing with a particular set of problems.  As the wives are leaving for an outing with underprivilage children, they receive a letter from Addie Ross, who is credited as the perfect woman by the men in tne movie.  She announces that she has run off with one of their husbands and this uncertainty provides the dramatic tension of the film. Three distinct episodes follow in which each of the women ponder whether her husband has left. Is it Brad Bishop (whose wife worries about fitting in with her husband's upper class friends), George Phipps (whose wife is trying to have a career and a home) or Porter Hollingsway (whose wife is from the wrong side of the tracks) who has left town with the never seen Ms Ross?The movie deals with issues such as commericalization, readjustment to civilian life after WWII, social mobility (a thread that runs through all the three stories) and what makes a marriage work.  The script is so well done that it keeps the viewer guessing until the last minute who has left with Addie Ross.

Ann Sothern, Jeanne Crain and Linda Darnell are the wives and Kirk Douglas and Paul Douglas are two of the husbands. Thelma Ritter is also on hand and is a delight as Sothern's common-as-dirt housekeeper who's also a friend of Darnell's equally common mother. The scenes in their tiny house's kitchen as the train goes by are a riot.

Mankiewicz achieved greatness as a writer first and a as director second. The screenplay sparkles with wit and humor and an edgy take on the modern world that is as up to date today as it was fifty-four years ago.Joe was a great writer and a consummate wit; were he not in the movies one might think him an intellectual. (Hats off to his ""Cleopatra""). He understood women and wrote some of the most complex, deep and exciting women on the screen. He gave them life on the page and then with his brilliant eye for casting and directing he brought them to life on the screen. Eve Harrington, Margo Channing, in ""All About Eve"". Maria Vargas in ""The Barefoot Contessa"", and his most complex of all his smart Cleopatra, a modern woman of politics and passion in an ancient setting.The unseen Addie Ross, the clumsy Deborah, Rita the writer, and the smart and guarded Lora Mae are just a few of the gems Joe Mankiewicz presented to us in his Oscar winning ""Letter"".  He brings out some of the best acting Jeanne Crain would ever do. She is both vulnerable and comic. Ann Sothern dominates the screen as a feminist ahead of her time. She cements the image that she would carry the rest of her career, that of a beautiful smart woman making it in a man's world. The stunning centerpiece to this work is the top-notch performance handed in by Linda Darnell as tough wrong side of the tracks Lora Mae.  This is a great performance by an actress who herself felt she had little to offer as an actress. Here with the help of her writer and director Miss Darnell delivers the goods as no one else of her generation possibly could.In a small role as Sadie Dugan, Thelma Ritter in her third film nearly steals the picture from all involved. Paul Douglas as Lora Mae's husband and meal ticket is at the top of his form. He matches Lora Mae word for word and punch for punch. And what a face he had! Kirk Douglas is right on the money in this early film of his career. The entire production is superb.Darryl F. Zanuck always stressed the importance of good writing and good story at his studio, 20th Century-Fox and over the decade that ""Letter to Three Wives"" ushered in he gave us some great works. He hired some of the best writers and directors of the day to work at his studio. At the top of that list was Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Personal differences aside between the two men, they did some wonderful things together. With what  Fox is now doing in it's incredible classics series on DVD, I hope they will devote some much needed attention to this classic film.",5,High Ho!

Mankiewicz's brilliant screenplay and direction on &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot; (1949) comes as close to perfection as movie melodrama has any right to. The plot, based on John Klempner's novel, concerns itself with three genuinely contented women; Deborah (Jeanne Crain), Lora Mae (Linda Darnell) and Rita (Ann Sothern). Contented, that is, until a mysterious letter surfaces from an equally mysterious source that claims to have carnal knowledge of one of their husbands. Which one? Well, that's what the rest of the film's plot is all about - smelling a rat. Deb' finds herself feeling helpless and lost amidst her husband, Brad's (Jeffrey Lynn) country club set. Could one those shallow jet setters be the backstabbing vixen who wrote the letter? Seeing her gold-digging way with a pocket book and the right sort of heel, Lora's husband, Porter (Paul Douglas) has just about had enough of Lora. Could he be the one straying? And what about Rita's husband, George (Kirk Douglas)? With a career that bests George's ability to keep the home front afloat, might he feel the need to go slumming with a gal who is, at least financially, more at his level? Mankiewicz's astute perceptions of the inner struggles and insecurities that make us all human, and his adept handling of the material from the director's seat, justly won the veteran film maker two Academy Awards. With a backup cast that includes the diabolically juicy Florence Bates, Hobart Cavanaugh and Connie Gilchrist, &quot;A Letter To Three Wives&quot; proves that all any picture needs to be thrilling is solid writing and fantastic performances.Fox has done a wonderful job in remastering this film for DVD. Working from second generation materials (no original camera negative exists), the DVD exhibits a very nicely contrasted black and white image with minimal film grain. Blacks are perhaps a tad weak, but this is to be expected from less than perfect source material. Otherwise, fine details are nicely realized, whites are very crisp and clean and shadow levels are adequately represented. Every attempt has been made through the use of digital technology to rebalance the image quality to as close to the original presentation as possible, and, for the most part, that is exactly how the film looks. An English stereo track is included. But this is a dialogue driven film so there's really not much point or difference between it and the original mono recording. Extras include the Biography Special on the tragic and brief life of Linda Darnell, a wonderful audio commentary by Mankiewicz's son, Christopher and biographers, Kenneth Geist and Cheryl Lower, some &quot;Movietones&quot; news reel footage and the original theatrical trailer. Both the film and the transfer come highly recommended for an old time Oscar-winning night at the movies.",4,"This is No Dead Letter: Scathing, Intelligent and Compelling",1109980800,"03 5, 2005",2005,2869,"['career', 'arguably', 'lows', 'Joseph', 'L.', 'Mankiewicz', 'brilliant', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'quot', 'A', 'Letter', 'Three', 'Wives', 'quot', '1949', 'as', 'close', 'perfection', 'movie', 'melodrama', 'right', 'plot', 'based', 'John', 'Klempner', 'novel', 'concerns', 'three', 'genuinely', 'contented', 'women', 'Deborah', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'Lora', 'Mae', 'Linda', 'Darnell', 'Rita', 'Ann', 'Sothern', 'Contented', 'mysterious', 'letter', 'surfaces', 'equally', 'mysterious', 'source', 'have', 'carnal', 'knowledge', 'one', 'husbands', 'Which', 'one', 'Well', 'what', 'rest', 'film', 'plot', 'smelling', 'rat', 'Deb', 'finds', 'feeling', 'helpless', 'lost', 'amidst', 'husband', 'Brad', 'Jeffrey', 'Lynn', 'country', 'club', 'set', 'Could', 'one', 'shallow', 'jet', 'setters', 'be', 'backstabbing', 'vixen', 'who', 'wrote', 'letter', 'Seeing', 'gold-digging', 'way', 'pocket', 'book', 'right', 'sort', 'heel', 'Lora', 'husband', 'Porter', 'Paul', 'Douglas', 'just', 'about', 'had', 'enough', 'Lora', 'Could', 'be', 'one', 'straying', 'what', 'Rita', 'husband', 'George', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'career', 'George', 'ability', 'keep', 'home', 'front', 'afloat', 'might', 'feel', 'need', 'go', 'slumming', 'gal', 'who', 'least', 'financially', 'more', 'level', 'Mankiewicz', 'astute', 'perceptions', 'inner', 'struggles', 'insecurities', 'make', 'human', 'adept', 'handling', 'material', 'director', 'seat', 'justly', 'won', 'veteran', 'film', 'maker', 'two', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'backup', 'cast', 'diabolically', 'juicy', 'Florence', 'Bates', 'Hobart', 'Cavanaugh', 'Connie', 'Gilchrist', 'quot', 'A', 'Letter', 'Three', 'Wives', 'quot', 'picture', 'be', 'thrilling', 'solid', 'writing', 'fantastic', 'performances.Fox', 'done', 'wonderful', 'job', 'remastering', 'film', 'DVD', 'Working', 'second', 'generation', 'materials', 'original', 'camera', 'negative', 'exists', 'DVD', 'very', 'nicely', 'contrasted', 'black', 'white', 'image', 'minimal', 'film', 'grain', 'Blacks', 'are', 'perhaps', 'tad', 'weak', 'be', 'expected', 'less', 'perfect', 'source', 'material', 'Otherwise', 'fine', 'details', 'are', 'nicely', 'realized', 'whites', 'are', 'very', 'crisp', 'clean', 'shadow', 'levels', 'are', 'adequately', 'represented', 'attempt', 'been', 'made', 'use', 'digital', 'technology', 'rebalance', 'image', 'quality', 'close', 'original', 'presentation', 'possible', 'most', 'part', 'exactly', 'how', 'film', 'English', 'stereo', 'track', 'included', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'point', 'difference', 'original', 'mono', 'recording', 'Extras', 'include', 'Biography', 'Special', 'tragic', 'brief', 'life', 'Linda', 'Darnell', 'wonderful', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Mankiewicz', 'son', 'Christopher', 'biographers', 'Kenneth', 'Geist', 'Cheryl', 'Lower', 'quot', 'Movietones', 'quot', 'news', 'reel', 'footage', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'film', 'transfer', 'come', 'highly', 'recommended', 'old', 'time', 'Oscar-winning', 'night', 'movies']",N/A

The film garnered two Oscars, both for Joseph Mankiewicz for his direction and screenplay.An ensemble cast of real pros weaves this domestic drama centering around Addie, a friend of the three that has claimed to have &quot;skipped town&quot; with one of the three husbands. Through flashbacks, the viewer learns about the respective marriages and the part that the enigmatic Addie plays in the proceedings.The entire cast is perfect. Ann Sothern, an actress that would make her mark in a 50's sitcom, has never looked lovelier and carries her independent woman role with relish. Kirk Douglas, as her husband, is extremely good, especially when he &quot;tells off&quot; Sothern's boss and when he explains the importance of his chosen profession.Linda Darnell is just too gorgeous for words.

Paul Douglas (no relation to Kirk) as Darnell's boss/fianc&eacute;'/husband is the perfect combination of hard-edged employee and love-struck puppy.Jeanne Crain, as the youngest and least experienced of the trio, is hilarious at a function where she's had a little too much &quot;bubbly&quot; in an effort to impress husband Brad's friends.

330668,A2G935GMRAUIRW,6302732964,Sandy McLendon,"[11, 11]","""A Letter to Three Wives"" would be anyone else's best movie. Since Joseph L. Mankiewicz followed ""Letter"" with ""All About Eve"", ""Letter"" is his second best, but it still towers over most films of its day.The story concerns a letter received by three small-town wives; the town femme fatale, Addie Ross, is running off with one of their husbands.  Mankiewicz uses flashbacks to give an insightful view of each of the three marriages involved, and demonstrates that each has its problems and is therefore eligible for a bust-up by Addie.The setting is the sort of small town that only existed on the back lots of movie studios; there's a right side of the tracks represented by a mansion, a middle-class district with an elm-lined street and brick Colonials, and a wrong side of the tracks that is no worse than picturesque.  The movie-ish milieu is soon forgotten by the viewer, however, because of the quality of the playing of each part.  Jeanne Crain is a poor girl who has married rich and suffers burning insecurities.  Linda Darnell is a scheming store clerk who flummoxes the boss into marrying her.  Ann Sothern- an actress who demonstrates that zaftig can be absolutely beautiful- is a radio writer who battles her school teacher husband over the literary quality of her work, and the effect of her earning power on the marriage.  Their husbands are played, respectively, by Jeffrey Lynn (blandly effective), Paul Douglas (gruffly effective), and Kirk Douglas (the essence of effective).  Minor roles are filled out by the late great Connie Gilchrist as Darnell's Ma, and by someone who was a newcomer in this movie, Thelma Ritter.The tension and byplay in the film are its chief delight; Darnell and Paul Douglas spar for much of their screen time, only to discover that their mutual needling masks mutual need.  Sothern and Kirk Douglas do their own sparring, but they also learn lessons; Sothern finds her radio writing is consuming her marriage, and that Kirk is well worth a cut-back in her work schedule.  Lynn and Crain are the weakest links, but Crain's nicely observed case of the willies at a big country-club dance is eminently watchable, and her drunk scene is a delight.  Ritter begins her long string of side-splitting acerbity in ""Letter""; she's a maid, and her scenes with Sothern show two immensely talented, evenly matched comedic actresses at the height of their powers, having a ball zinging everything and everyone in the movie, including each other.The protagonist, Addie Ross, is never seen, but she narrates the film in voice-over, done by Celeste Holm.  Holm's distinctive voice gets a full workout here; her genius for conveying subtext with such devices as a dry inflection here, a kidding British accent there, is alone worth the time and price of a viewing.Mankiewicz wraps up all three stories at one last country-club dance, where all three wives and only two husbands are in attendance.  Think it's all over at that point?  Well, it isn't; Mank throws in a fast red-herring ending that leaves everything and everybody in fine shape, except...Watch the movie to find out what happens.

We as well as they are asked to contemplate which wife will go husbandless. That we care at all is a credit to Mankiewicz's witty script, to 20th-Century Fox for okaying the production, and to the shrewdly chosen actors.Mankiewicz has worked with some of them before (Thelma Ritter and Celeste Holm in ""All About Eve,"" Jeanne Crain in ""People Will Talk""), but Ann Sothern, Kirk Douglas and especially Linda Darnell also respond well to him. Holmes' unseen voiceover seems dated today, the film's not in color (as Amazon has it), and feminisim had yet to entitle women to lives of their own.

Joseph Mankiewicz's catty soap opera has plenty of witty dialogue and strong performances. His adaptation of Letter to Five Wives (I guess the other two wives were too busy to appear in the movie) pared down the quintet to a trio bringing a tighter focus to the drama from John Klempner's serialized novel. Although all three female leads are great Linda Darnell's performance as a gold digger who married for money is a stand out. This terrific actress got her start at the age of 15 in movies (Fox head Darryl Zannick cheated on her age in the press releases) and appeared in a number of roles none of which garnered the Oscar nomination she so desperately deserved (although she did get a spot in the cement at Grauman's Chinese Theater in the 40's).Fox has painstakingly restored this classic film. The original camera negative disappeared ages ago (it was shot on unstable nitrate stock) but an earlier fine grain positive existed that was made directly from the original negative. Fox carefully used it to restore the film to its former luster. The image has a sharpness, clarity and depth missing in previous editions of the movie. The blacks are deeper and richer than on previous editions of the film and the compression artifacts have been kept to a minimum. Although the box mentions that this is in stereo, it sounds as if the original optical soundtrack has been artificially reprocessed for stereo. That's not a bad thing necessarily as the sound has a richer depth and less problems with hiss and other issues that dogged films from this time frame. The original mono soundtrack is also here as well.A great biography from A&E;'s Biography series appears here on the life of Linda Darnell. While that shorts the other fine actresses in the film, the documentary provide a great deal of detail about Darnell's tragic life and interesting tidbits about the making of the film. Darnell's surviving sister, Roddy MacDowall, Darnell's daughter and many others provide a full picture of the actress. Featuring home movie footage of Darnell and stills from her family's collection, it's an excellent glimpse into her life.  Fox's Movietone News provides the highlights of the 1949 Academy Awards where Mankiewicz won Oscars for Best Screenplay and Best Director.The commentary is by Christopher Mankiewicz  and Mankiewicz's biographers Kenneth Geist and Cheryl Lower. All three provide very different details about the film. Geist and Lower focus on the importance of Mankiewicz's films and the underlying meaning of them as well as details about the various performers that appear in the film. Christopher Mankiewicz gives quite a bit of personal details about his father's life and what was occurring as he was making this film.This terrific, witty character study overcomes the soap opera trappings of the story due to Mankiewicz's terrific ear for dialogue and sharp direction. The trio of actresses in the main roles give great performances as do most of the supporting cast. The extras provide quite a bit of background on the making of the film via vintage newsreels and an excellent episode of A&E;'s Biography. The commentary track although a bit dry benefits from having three very different perspectives of the film.",5,"Witty, catty and enjoyable Mankiewicz classic comes to DVD",1108252800,"02 13, 2005",2005,3345,"['Three', 'women', 'boating', 'trip', 'receive', 'letter', 'woman', 'claiming', 'stolen', 'one', 'husbands', 'Joseph', 'Mankiewicz', 'catty', 'soap', 'opera', 'plenty', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'strong', 'performances', 'adaptation', 'Letter', 'Five', 'Wives', 'guess', 'other', 'two', 'wives', 'were', 'too', 'busy', 'appear', 'movie', 'pared', 'quintet', 'trio', 'bringing', 'tighter', 'focus', 'drama', 'John', 'Klempner', 'serialized', 'novel', 'three', 'female', 'leads', 'are', 'great', 'Linda', 'Darnell', 'performance', 'gold', 'digger', 'who', 'married', 'money', 'stand', 'out', 'terrific', 'actress', 'got', 'start', 'age', '15', 'movies', 'Fox', 'head', 'Darryl', 'Zannick', 'cheated', 'age', 'press', 'appeared', 'number', 'roles', 'none', 'garnered', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'so', 'desperately', 'deserved', 'did', 'get', 'spot', 'cement', 'Grauman', 'Chinese', 'Theater', '40', '.Fox', 'painstakingly', 'restored', 'classic', 'film', 'original', 'camera', 'negative', 'disappeared', 'ages', 'ago', 'was', 'shot', 'unstable', 'nitrate', 'stock', 'earlier', 'fine', 'grain', 'positive', 'existed', 'was', 'made', 'directly', 'original', 'negative', 'Fox', 'carefully', 'used', 'restore', 'film', 'former', 'luster', 'image', 'sharpness', 'clarity', 'depth', 'missing', 'previous', 'editions', 'movie', 'blacks', 'are', 'deeper', 'richer', 'previous', 'editions', 'film', 'compression', 'artifacts', 'have', 'been', 'kept', 'minimum', 'box', 'mentions', 'stereo', 'original', 'optical', 'soundtrack', 'been', 'artificially', 'reprocessed', 'stereo', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'necessarily', 'sound', 'richer', 'depth', 'less', 'problems', 'hiss', 'other', 'issues', 'dogged', 'films', 'time', 'frame', 'original', 'mono', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'here', 'well.A', 'great', 'biography', 'A', 'E', 'Biography', 'series', 'here', 'life', 'Linda', 'Darnell', 'other', 'fine', 'actresses', 'film', 'documentary', 'provide', 'great', 'deal', 'detail', 'Darnell', 'tragic', 'life', 'interesting', 'tidbits', 'making', 'film', 'Darnell', 'surviving', 'sister', 'Roddy', 'MacDowall', 'Darnell', 'daughter', 'many', 'others', 'provide', 'full', 'picture', 'actress', 'Featuring', 'home', 'movie', 'footage', 'Darnell', 'stills', 'family', 'collection', 'excellent', 'glimpse', 'life', 'Fox', 'Movietone', 'News', 'highlights', '1949', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'where', 'Mankiewicz', 'won', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Director.The', 'commentary', 'Christopher', 'Mankiewicz', 'Mankiewicz', 'biographers', 'Kenneth', 'Geist', 'Cheryl', 'Lower', 'three', 'provide', 'very', 'different', 'details', 'film', 'Geist', 'Lower', 'focus', 'importance', 'Mankiewicz', 'films', 'underlying', 'meaning', 'as', 'well', 'details', 'various', 'performers', 'appear', 'film', 'Christopher', 'Mankiewicz', 'quite', 'bit', 'personal', 'details', 'father', 'life', 'what', 'was', 'occurring', 'was', 'making', 'film.This', 'terrific', 'witty', 'character', 'study', 'soap', 'opera', 'trappings', 'story', 'due', 'Mankiewicz', 'terrific', 'ear', 'dialogue', 'sharp', 'direction', 'trio', 'actresses', 'main', 'roles', 'give', 'great', 'performances', 'do', 'most', 'supporting', 'cast', 'extras', 'provide', 'quite', 'bit', 'background', 'making', 'film', 'vintage', 'newsreels', 'excellent', 'episode', 'A', 'E', 'Biography', 'commentary', 'track', 'bit', 'dry', 'benefits', 'having', 'three', 'very', 'different', 'perspectives', 'film']",N/A
330674,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,6302732964,William Hare,"[7, 7]","World War Two had recently ended and things were settling back to normal in affluent Connecticut suburbia until a bombshell from out of the blue thrust three reasonably contented wives into a state of panic.Joseph Mankiewicz had a genuine feel for dialogue and human conflict.  He directed and wrote ""A Letter to Three Wives"" in between ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" with Gene Tierney and Rex Harrison and his classic of theatrical double and triple dealing, ""All About Eve"" when newcomer Anne Baxter on the surface seeks to befriend Broadway star Bette Davis while plotting to overthrow her theatrical dynasty.The 1949 release reveals the women frightened over a letter that a local charmer noted for having her way with men has written to three wives informing them that one of their husband is preparing to run away with her and say goodbye to suburban Connecticut marriage.  The question is ""Which one?"" and this is the driving force that makes this sophisticated Mankiewicz drama a pure delight.We never see the dazzling woman who has such compelling power and presence over the opposite sex that three beautiful and intelligent women fear that she will run off with her husband.  Mankiewicz knew how to tease his viewers, offering them just a little bit, then  holding back to leave them begging for more.This is illustrated by the fact that we never see this woman who seeks to manipulate events behind the scenes and drive three women into torturous tizzy.  The voice generates a perfect mix of confident appeal and daring sophistication to convince viewers that this indeed is a woman that the film's three female stars have reason to fear.  The narrator is Celeste Holm, who got her big break in ""Oklahoma"" on Broadway and would be cast as Bette Davis's best friend in ""All About Eve.""Jeanne Crain exudes a sweet and sincere beauty, the kind that could attract a man like Jeffrey Lynn, her stalwart husband who demonstrates solidity.  Crain is fearful that her homespun manner might not be sophisticated and worldly enough to compete with the likes of Addie Ross, the woman behind the scenes.Ann Sothern is a woman of shrewdness and creativity who feels edgy over the fact that, as a writer of radio soap operas, she makes more money than her intellectual schoolteacher husband.  Mankiewicz sets up a fascinating clash between Sothern's husband Kirk Douglas and his wife's bosses, the producers of the soap opera drama for which Sothern writes.  Their commercialism and anti-intellectualism disgust Douglas.  He gets even in the manner of a teacher by correcting the female boss' grammar.Linda Darnell grew up literally next to the tracks.  The trains pass by at speedy clips and the apartment where she resides with her mother and sister rocks.  Linda, a sales girl at the town department store, sees an opportunity to move up the local social ladder when Paul Douglas, the store's owner, expresses romantic interest.Darnell seeks to steer a discrete course between displaying interest and playing hard to get, eventually winning her man.The scenes in the apartment being rocked back and forth periodically by jolts from trains speeding down tracks while Darnell's mother, Connie Gilchrist, along with her friend Thelma Ritter drink beer and play cards, deliver superb comic relief from the unfolding domestic suspense.Ritter delivers her usual saucy lines as the film's Greek Chorus, a role she would soon reprise for Mankiewicz as Bette Davis's lady in waiting in ""All About Eve"" and eventually for Alfred Hitchcock as she lectures James Stewart on why he should marry Grace Kelly in ""Rear Window.""Mankiewicz keeps the pot boiling, maintaining suspense until the dramatic conclusion when the nervous wives learn the identity of the man Addie Ross insists will forego matrimony for her.  Who is the man and will he actually leave his wife as Ross confidently proclaims?Enjoy the suspense and stay tuned.",5,"Mankiewicz at Acerbic Best; Darnell, Crain and Sothern as Nervous Wives",1172448000,"02 26, 2007",2007,3911,"['World', 'War', 'Two', 'had', 'recently', 'ended', 'things', 'were', 'settling', 'back', 'normal', 'affluent', 'Connecticut', 'suburbia', 'bombshell', 'blue', 'thrust', 'three', 'reasonably', 'contented', 'wives', 'state', 'panic.Joseph', 'Mankiewicz', 'had', 'genuine', 'feel', 'dialogue', 'human', 'conflict', 'directed', 'wrote', 'A', 'Letter', 'Three', 'Wives', 'Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'classic', 'theatrical', 'double', 'triple', 'dealing', 'Eve', 'when', 'newcomer', 'Anne', 'Baxter', 'surface', 'befriend', 'Broadway', 'star', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'plotting', 'overthrow', 'theatrical', 'dynasty.The', '1949', 'release', 'women', 'frightened', 'letter', 'local', 'charmer', 'noted', 'having', 'way', 'men', 'written', 'three', 'wives', 'informing', 'one', 'husband', 'preparing', 'run', 'away', 'say', 'goodbye', 'suburban', 'Connecticut', 'marriage', 'question', 'Which', 'one', 'driving', 'force', 'sophisticated', 'Mankiewicz', 'drama', 'pure', 'delight.We', 'never', 'see', 'dazzling', 'woman', 'who', 'such', 'compelling', 'power', 'presence', 'opposite', 'sex', 'three', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'women', 'fear', 'will', 'run', 'off', 'husband', 'Mankiewicz', 'knew', 'how', 'tease', 'viewers', 'offering', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'then', 'holding', 'back', 'leave', 'begging', 'more.This', 'illustrated', 'fact', 'never', 'see', 'woman', 'who', 'manipulate', 'events', 'scenes', 'drive', 'three', 'women', 'torturous', 'tizzy', 'voice', 'perfect', 'mix', 'confident', 'appeal', 'daring', 'sophistication', 'convince', 'viewers', 'indeed', 'woman', 'film', 'three', 'female', 'stars', 'have', 'reason', 'fear', 'narrator', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'who', 'got', 'big', 'break', 'Oklahoma', 'Broadway', 'would', 'be', 'cast', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'best', 'friend', 'Eve', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'sweet', 'sincere', 'beauty', 'kind', 'could', 'attract', 'man', 'Jeffrey', 'Lynn', 'stalwart', 'husband', 'who', 'solidity', 'Crain', 'fearful', 'homespun', 'manner', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'sophisticated', 'worldly', 'enough', 'compete', 'likes', 'Addie', 'Ross', 'woman', 'scenes.Ann', 'Sothern', 'woman', 'shrewdness', 'creativity', 'who', 'edgy', 'fact', 'that', 'writer', 'radio', 'soap', 'operas', 'more', 'money', 'intellectual', 'schoolteacher', 'husband', 'Mankiewicz', 'up', 'fascinating', 'clash', 'Sothern', 'husband', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'wife', 'bosses', 'producers', 'soap', 'opera', 'drama', 'Sothern', 'commercialism', 'anti-intellectualism', 'disgust', 'Douglas', 'even', 'manner', 'teacher', 'correcting', 'female', 'boss', 'grammar.Linda', 'Darnell', 'grew', 'up', 'literally', 'next', 'tracks', 'trains', 'pass', 'speedy', 'clips', 'apartment', 'where', 'mother', 'sister', 'rocks', 'Linda', 'sales', 'girl', 'town', 'department', 'store', 'opportunity', 'move', 'up', 'local', 'social', 'ladder', 'when', 'Paul', 'Douglas', 'store', 'owner', 'romantic', 'interest.Darnell', 'steer', 'discrete', 'course', 'displaying', 'interest', 'playing', 'hard', 'get', 'eventually', 'winning', 'man.The', 'scenes', 'apartment', 'being', 'rocked', 'back', 'forth', 'periodically', 'jolts', 'trains', 'speeding', 'down', 'tracks', 'Darnell', 'mother', 'Connie', 'Gilchrist', 'friend', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'drink', 'beer', 'play', 'cards', 'deliver', 'superb', 'comic', 'relief', 'unfolding', 'domestic', 'suspense.Ritter', 'delivers', 'usual', 'saucy', 'lines', 'film', 'Greek', 'Chorus', 'role', 'would', 'soon', 'reprise', 'Mankiewicz', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'lady', 'waiting', 'Eve', 'eventually', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'James', 'Stewart', 'why', 'should', 'marry', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Mankiewicz', 'pot', 'boiling', 'maintaining', 'suspense', 'dramatic', 'conclusion', 'when', 'nervous', 'wives', 'learn', 'identity', 'man', 'Addie', 'Ross', 'insists', 'will', 'forego', 'matrimony', 'Who', 'man', 'will', 'actually', 'leave', 'wife', 'Ross', 'confidently', 'Enjoy', 'suspense', 'stay', 'tuned']",N/A
