928977,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B000AMJG5S,A. Gammill,"[17, 17]","It's pretty much universally acknowledged that Soap's final season was not its best.  I think a large part of the blame can be attributed to the additon of several new writers to the staff.  The brilliant Susan Harris was still at the wheel, but must have lost some control over the other writers.  Characters we've grown to know and love seem to have changed for the worse.  Two of the best-loved ones (played by, arguably, the show's best comic actors), Jessica and Burt, suddenly became less sympathetic.  And Danny Dallas was certainly never that bright, but he seems to have undergone a lobotomy by the fourth season.  Dutch and Eunice became increasingly irritating, Billy and the Major were neglected; and of course the loss of Diana Canova as Corinne didn't help matters.And let me join in the chorus of Soap fans unhappy with the DVD presentation of this, the FINAL Soap set we'll ever see.  A retrospective segment would seem essential, considering the way the show ended.  We know the creators are still out there, as well as several cast members.  Longtime fans will recall that the ghost(?) of Jessica Tate appeared in the 5th season of BENSON in an episode appropriately titled ""God, I Need This Job.""  What a terrific ""extra"" that would have been for this set.I give it 3 stars simply because Soap was a fantastic, funny, touching and original show.  And even with the aforementioned detriments, season four wasn't a complete waste.  And if you're a fan of the show, you'll want to have it.  I just wish Sony would have spent a little more time and effort to reward our loyalty.",3,These questions WON'T be answered in the next episode of Soap...,1141344000,"03 3, 2006",2006,1593,"['pretty', 'much', 'universally', 'acknowledged', 'Soap', 'final', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'think', 'large', 'part', 'blame', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'additon', 'several', 'new', 'writers', 'staff', 'brilliant', 'Susan', 'Harris', 'was', 'still', 'wheel', 'must', 'have', 'lost', 'control', 'other', 'writers', 'Characters', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'know', 'love', 'seem', 'have', 'changed', 'worse', 'Two', 'best-loved', 'ones', 'played', 'arguably', 'show', 'best', 'comic', 'actors', 'Jessica', 'Burt', 'suddenly', 'became', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'Danny', 'Dallas', 'was', 'certainly', 'never', 'bright', 'have', 'undergone', 'lobotomy', 'fourth', 'season', 'Dutch', 'Eunice', 'became', 'increasingly', 'irritating', 'Billy', 'Major', 'were', 'neglected', 'course', 'loss', 'Diana', 'Canova', 'Corinne', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters.And', 'let', 'join', 'chorus', 'Soap', 'fans', 'unhappy', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'FINAL', 'Soap', 'set', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'retrospective', 'segment', 'would', 'seem', 'essential', 'considering', 'way', 'show', 'ended', 'know', 'creators', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'cast', 'members', 'Longtime', 'fans', 'will', 'recall', 'ghost', 'Jessica', 'Tate', 'appeared', '5th', 'season', 'BENSON', 'episode', 'appropriately', 'titled', 'God', 'Need', 'Job', 'What', 'terrific', 'extra', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'set.I', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'simply', 'Soap', 'was', 'fantastic', 'funny', 'touching', 'original', 'show', 'even', 'aforementioned', 'detriments', 'season', 'four', 'was', ""n't"", 'complete', 'waste', ""'re"", 'fan', 'show', ""'ll"", 'want', 'have', 'just', 'wish', 'Sony', 'would', 'have', 'spent', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'effort', 'reward', 'loyalty']",N/A
928978,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B000AMJG5S,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[8, 8]","I've got all the ""Soap"" DVD sets, but this is by far the worst. By the time the series came to it's fourth season, too many good characters had left, some really dumb ones had been written in, and the plots were nothing like as entertaining as in former years. The main casualty was the loss of Robert Guillaume as Benson in the last few episodes of Season 3, his ultra-dry wit was never equalled or replaced by the lack-lustre Saunders. Secondly we also lost Diana Canova as Corrine, who was one of the better actors among the younger generation of the cast, and had been particularly effective in several emotional scenes that featured her character.All the best and funniest plotlines such as Chester's memory loss, Corrinne's possessed baby, Billy and the Sunnies and Burt's UFO abduction (ok that one was pushing it a bit!) are distant memories. The dramatic stories were also much better, with Billy's courtroom battle for custody of his daughter as a fine example. Now, with such meagre stories as Jodie being turned into an old Jewish guy and Jessica lost in the revolution, the series struggles to maintain the viewers interest.After greedily consuming all the episodes in the first three season DVDs - sometimes in batches of 3 or 4 at a time - I really couldn't rustle up much interest in seeing all of the Season 4 episodes after watching the first few. With Jessica not able to interact with any of the other cast due to being lost in the jungle with the dire El Puerco, and Mary turning into an alcoholic (what a horrible storyline to give one of the warmest and most level-headed characters of the whole show), you just don't feel that this is the same story any more.If you are a fan or just want a nostalgia trip, I would recommend buying the first 3 seasons and then retiring on a high. This last DVD set does nothing but drag the series into the mud. There isn't even an end or conclusion to any plotlines, as the series was not expected to end here. And if you watch this season, you'll know why it did.",2,Sad ending to a legend.,1160438400,"10 10, 2006",2006,2023,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'Soap', 'DVD', 'sets', 'far', 'worst', 'time', 'series', 'came', 'fourth', 'season', 'too', 'many', 'good', 'characters', 'had', 'left', 'really', 'dumb', 'ones', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'plots', 'were', 'nothing', 'as', 'entertaining', 'former', 'years', 'main', 'casualty', 'was', 'loss', 'Robert', 'Guillaume', 'Benson', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'Season', '3', 'ultra-dry', 'wit', 'was', 'never', 'equalled', 'replaced', 'lack-lustre', 'Saunders', 'Secondly', 'also', 'lost', 'Diana', 'Canova', 'Corrine', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'actors', 'younger', 'generation', 'cast', 'had', 'been', 'particularly', 'effective', 'several', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'featured', 'character.All', 'best', 'funniest', 'plotlines', 'such', 'Chester', 'memory', 'loss', 'Corrinne', 'possessed', 'baby', 'Billy', 'Sunnies', 'Burt', 'UFO', 'abduction', 'one', 'was', 'pushing', 'bit', 'are', 'distant', 'memories', 'dramatic', 'stories', 'were', 'also', 'much', 'better', 'Billy', 'courtroom', 'battle', 'custody', 'daughter', 'fine', 'example', 'Now', 'such', 'meagre', 'stories', 'Jodie', 'being', 'turned', 'old', 'Jewish', 'guy', 'Jessica', 'lost', 'revolution', 'series', 'maintain', 'viewers', 'interest.After', 'greedily', 'consuming', 'episodes', 'first', 'three', 'season', 'DVDs', 'sometimes', 'batches', '3', '4', 'time', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'rustle', 'up', 'much', 'interest', 'seeing', 'Season', '4', 'episodes', 'watching', 'first', 'few', 'Jessica', 'not', 'able', 'interact', 'other', 'cast', 'due', 'being', 'lost', 'jungle', 'dire', 'El', 'Puerco', 'Mary', 'turning', 'alcoholic', 'what', 'horrible', 'storyline', 'give', 'one', 'warmest', 'most', 'level-headed', 'characters', 'whole', 'show', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'same', 'story', 'more.If', 'are', 'fan', 'just', 'want', 'nostalgia', 'trip', 'would', 'recommend', 'buying', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'then', 'retiring', 'high', 'last', 'DVD', 'set', 'nothing', 'drag', 'series', 'mud', ""n't"", 'even', 'end', 'conclusion', 'plotlines', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'expected', 'end', 'here', 'watch', 'season', ""'ll"", 'know', 'why', 'did']",N/A

928989,A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5,B000AMJG5S,Joseph Haggard Jr.,"[1, 1]","Here is the fourth and final season of ""Soap"", the mostly hilarious sitcom that debuted to much controversy in 1977. While there are lots of laughs in the show's final year, it's by far the weakest season of the four. And it's kinda easy to see why. At the beginning of season three ""Soap"" lost a key character, Benson. At the beginning of season four the show lost another major character, Corrine Tate (the daughter of Jessica Tate). Diana Canova was the beautiful and talented actress who protrayed the sexy Corrine for the first three seasons. And even though she wasn't quite the scene stealer as Robert Guillaume was as Benson, I thought her character was a major asset to the show. Canova's departure started to send ""Soap"" on kind of a downhill slide. I'll mind you thought that it wasn't a major downhill slide. ""Soap"" still has some very funny moments in season four, until it's last episode. It has what has got to be the worst ending for a TV sitcom in television history. One of the major aspects of ""Soap"" is that at the end of each season there's a big cliffhanger that eventually got solved at the beginning of the very next season. And the end of season four had a big cliffhanger ending that looked to be resolved at the beginning of season five. However, there would not be a fifth season of ""Soap"". ABC cancelled the show after four years, saying that the show's ratings had gotten low and the show's storylines had gone flat and tiresome. That's a shame that ""Soap"" had to end so abruptly as it did. They should have filmed one final episode to resolve all of those cliffhangers. But we'll really never know what happened in the end. Although I heard that Jessica Tate's fate was later resolved in an episode of the ""Soap"" spin-off show ""Benson"".""Soap"" was a great show for most of its four years. It's a shame that it had to end in disappointing fashion (no thanks to ABC). But I own all four seasons of ""Soap"" on DVD, and when I watch the episodes from here on out I'll laugh out loud at all the crazy situations that went on between those two dysfunctional families: the Tates and the Campbells.

Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[4, 5]","While ""Soap"" lost a bit of steam during its fourth & final season (the absence of popular character Benson and a continuing barrage of complaints from ""morality"" groups), it still relied on its main strengths--a wacky, wonderful cast ensemble and witty, insightful writing--to carry it through.The addition of actor Roscoe Lee Brown as Saunders, the new servant to the Tates family, certainly didn't hurt. True, he's no Benson, but Saunders' dry, formal delivery of lines cuts through the typical insanity of the Tates and the Campbells.Some of the plotlines continued the series' trademark lunacy: Jessica Tate hooking up with latin revolutionary El Puerco (??); Jodie Dallas channeling the spirit of an old Jewish man via psycho-therapy (an excuse to showcase Billy Crystal's talent for doing funny characters); and the Tates teetering on the verge of bankruptcy.As usual, each of the cast members have their moments, but the standouts have to be: Katherine Helmond as Jessica, who elevates the word ""dizzy"" to a new level; Robert Mandan as Chester Tate, a stellar example of snivelling buffoonery; Ted Wass as Danny, who goes over the top as the ""dumb hunk""; and Billy Crystal who, to his credit, has given his character depth & humanity instead of just being a one-joke idea.It's just a shame that the network didn't have the foresight to re-unite the cast & crew for a special 2-hour ""Soap"" movie to tie up all the loose ends; this classic series, at least, deserved that much.",4,...and Soap rides off (inconclusively) into the sunset...,1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,1482,"['Soap', 'lost', 'bit', 'steam', 'fourth', 'final', 'season', 'absence', 'popular', 'character', 'Benson', 'continuing', 'barrage', 'complaints', 'morality', 'groups', 'still', 'relied', 'main', 'strengths', 'wacky', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'ensemble', 'witty', 'insightful', 'writing', 'carry', 'through.The', 'addition', 'actor', 'Roscoe', 'Lee', 'Brown', 'Saunders', 'new', 'servant', 'Tates', 'family', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'True', 'Benson', 'Saunders', 'dry', 'formal', 'delivery', 'lines', 'cuts', 'typical', 'insanity', 'Tates', 'Campbells.Some', 'plotlines', 'continued', 'series', 'trademark', 'lunacy', 'Jessica', 'Tate', 'hooking', 'up', 'latin', 'revolutionary', 'El', 'Puerco', 'Jodie', 'Dallas', 'channeling', 'spirit', 'old', 'Jewish', 'man', 'psycho-therapy', 'excuse', 'showcase', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'talent', 'doing', 'funny', 'characters', 'Tates', 'teetering', 'verge', 'bankruptcy.As', 'usual', 'cast', 'members', 'have', 'moments', 'standouts', 'have', 'be', 'Katherine', 'Helmond', 'Jessica', 'who', 'word', 'dizzy', 'new', 'level', 'Robert', 'Mandan', 'Chester', 'Tate', 'stellar', 'example', 'snivelling', 'buffoonery', 'Ted', 'Wass', 'Danny', 'who', 'top', 'dumb', 'hunk', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'who', 'credit', 'given', 'character', 'depth', 'humanity', 'instead', 'just', 'being', 'one-joke', 'idea.It', 'just', 'shame', 'network', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'foresight', 're-unite', 'cast', 'crew', 'special', '2-hour', 'Soap', 'movie', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'classic', 'series', 'least', 'deserved', 'much']",N/A
928994,AK1OBVI54SY73,B000AMJG5S,"Rocky ""Raquel""","[2, 3]","I have all four seasons of SOAP and I do give all five stars for this was one funny and daring show. My parents absolutely loved the show and as a kid I grew up on it as well until they took it off cable as well. When they begun to put it on DVD in a collection I made sure to snatch them up. I am saddened by the fourth season though and that's why I shave off a star because the season ended in the most grim fashion. They left us on a severe cliff hanger and never said no word after. I am upset by this and further more that they were cancelled. My parents said that the show was just growing too controversial for normal viewers and I can't believe that. What do they want just a show about teenagers trying to get dates for their dance? How lame is that.SOAP was an honest show showing how families truly act a lot of the time and what they as individuals get themselves caught into and they blended humor with it. It's hard to make humor and controversy together but it can be done and SOAP did an excellent job about it. Viewers were silly for this was a great show and deserved to finish up the fourth season at least with one more season. I wished they had at least added in someplace where they told us what they were planning to write for a next season script, just for us to get a glimpse of what will happen to our major characters who in the last show are in deep trouble including Burt and Danny and most of all Jessica- who always is in trouble.On the positive side the part I love the most on this season is when Mary and Jodie are at the table, and Jodie is of course an old Jewish man now, and he is comforting Mary because she is at the end of her rope (who wouldn't be?)- and she says as both Julius and Jodie he has the same good heart and I found that so sweet and one of the most touching scenes in the whole show's history.I love SOAP it was a great show while it lasted. It should have lasted longer, but people just weren't ready for it. SOAP was ahead of it's time basically. It would be well- accepted nowadays but not back then truly. Sad, yet there's not much you can do anymore. All you can do is just enjoy the epidsodes that were made.
