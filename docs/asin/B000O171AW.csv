Season 2 also was difficult to access.

I unfortunately missed the series when it first started in NZ, but was hooked on it when I saw the reruns of Season 1. I love this show. My family love this show. It is not unusual for us to sit and watch 3 episodes in a row. Yes, I know that is sad! I love the acting, the special effects and the general storylines. The Wrath petrify me like the cybermen did in Doctor Who when I was a wee girl. I am waiting somewhat impatiently for Season 3 to arrive on my doorstep.

1061719,A10CJINP7KBR4W,B000O171AW,M. Herzog,"[0, 0]","The first two season of Stargate Atlantis brought me back to a classic sci-fi feeling.  It isn't dark and bleak, nor is it so engrossed in being real it can't bend any rules.  No, Stargate Atlantis is far more fun, with a bunch of unique characters doing a bunch of fun things.  Its more akin to the original star trek, with a dash of adventure escapism.  I can't think of a more fun show in sci-fi in recent memory.

I never got into the regular Stargate series, it was nothing more than a distraction to me, it was just too hit and miss. I really like the Storyline of this, even tho it spawned from the original series. It has a good story, and some believable enemies, at least for the first few seasons.....",5,Great fun....
