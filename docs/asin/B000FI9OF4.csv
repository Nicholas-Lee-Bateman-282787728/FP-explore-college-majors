990517,A3A6O7SC8LKXDL,B000FI9OF4,EPA316,"[8, 8]","This is a good DVD for anyone who has never paid any attention to the Seahawks before 2005, which is basically most of the NFL's fans. I like the way it shows the Seahawks blasting through a 13-3 season, including 11 straight wins. It shows good reactions of the opposing sideline's coaches and players when they know it's all over. This DVD glosses over the horrible officiating in Super Bowl XL. I'm not going to say that's the ONLY reason Seattle lost that game, but it certainly took away a lot of their points, and therefore took the fight out of them toward the end of the game. My final word on the Super Bowl is that soon after, head coach Mike Holmgren publicly commented that he was surprised that his team had to play the guys in the striped shirts as well as Pittsburgh, which is basically publicly calling the NFL officials corrupt and unfair, and he was NOT fined by the NFL. What does that tell you?Anyway, back to the DVD.. There are a lot of funny extras from the sidelines that you'd never hear otherwise, such as QB Matt Hasselbeck commenting to a ref about a booger in his nose right before the coin toss at the Super Bowl, and how poor Matt responds to a bee sting in training camp. Also lots of opposing players BSing with the Seahawks in a friendly way that you don't see too much. It's a good DVD overall, well worth the cost, which is not that much anyway.",5,2005 NFC Champs,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,1381,"['good', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'never', 'paid', 'attention', 'Seahawks', '2005', 'basically', 'most', 'NFL', 'fans', 'way', 'Seahawks', 'blasting', '13-3', 'season', 'including', '11', 'straight', 'wins', 'good', 'reactions', 'opposing', 'sideline', 'coaches', 'players', 'when', 'know', 'over', 'DVD', 'horrible', 'officiating', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'XL', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'ONLY', 'reason', 'Seattle', 'lost', 'game', 'certainly', 'took', 'away', 'lot', 'points', 'therefore', 'took', 'fight', 'end', 'game', 'final', 'word', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'soon', 'head', 'coach', 'Mike', 'Holmgren', 'publicly', 'commented', 'was', 'surprised', 'team', 'had', 'play', 'guys', 'striped', 'shirts', 'as', 'well', 'Pittsburgh', 'basically', 'publicly', 'calling', 'NFL', 'officials', 'corrupt', 'unfair', 'was', 'NOT', 'fined', 'NFL', 'What', 'tell', 'Anyway', 'back', 'DVD..', 'are', 'lot', 'funny', 'extras', 'sidelines', ""'d"", 'never', 'hear', 'otherwise', 'such', 'QB', 'Matt', 'Hasselbeck', 'commenting', 'ref', 'booger', 'nose', 'right', 'coin', 'toss', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'how', 'poor', 'Matt', 'bee', 'sting', 'training', 'camp', 'Also', 'lots', 'opposing', 'players', 'BSing', 'Seahawks', 'friendly', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'DVD', 'overall', 'well', 'cost', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'anyway']",NFL - Seattle Seahawks 2005 NFC Champions
990518,A388GY2SRT8ES7,B000FI9OF4,PA reviewer,"[5, 5]","2005 was the Seattle Seahawks best season to date. They were the best team in the NFL that year, and that was demonstrated to the world when they wiped up Detroit's Ford Field with the Pittsburgh Steelers on February 5, 2006. The ONLY thing that saved the Steelers that day was the officiating.The DVD contains virtually everything a Seahawks fan would want it to contain. A review of every game of the regular season and the playoffs, the full half-hour NFL Game of the Week presentation of the NFC Championship Game against the Carolina Panthers. There are mini-documentaries about the Seahawks 2005 training camp, Mike Holmgren's career, Kenny Easley, Steve Largent, and a genuinely moving story about linebacker Isaiah Kacyvenski's rough life growing up in rural New York.The only disappointment with the DVD was beyond the control of the makers of the DVD: HOW do you present to Seahawks fans the NFL championship game that was openly and deliberately thrown to the Steelers through biased officiating? There was no getting around it. The game was a complete, total, and utter travesty of justice and sportsmanship, and I lost a tremendous amount of respect for the NFL that day.",5,Good Review of Seahawks Best Season,1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,1184,"['2005', 'was', 'Seattle', 'Seahawks', 'best', 'season', 'date', 'were', 'best', 'team', 'NFL', 'year', 'was', 'demonstrated', 'world', 'when', 'wiped', 'up', 'Detroit', 'Ford', 'Field', 'Pittsburgh', 'Steelers', 'February', '5', '2006', 'ONLY', 'thing', 'saved', 'Steelers', 'day', 'was', 'officiating.The', 'DVD', 'virtually', 'everything', 'Seahawks', 'fan', 'would', 'want', 'contain', 'review', 'game', 'regular', 'season', 'playoffs', 'full', 'half-hour', 'NFL', 'Game', 'Week', 'presentation', 'NFC', 'Championship', 'Game', 'Carolina', 'Panthers', 'are', 'mini-documentaries', 'Seahawks', '2005', 'training', 'camp', 'Mike', 'Holmgren', 'career', 'Kenny', 'Easley', 'Steve', 'Largent', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'story', 'linebacker', 'Isaiah', 'Kacyvenski', 'rough', 'life', 'growing', 'up', 'rural', 'New', 'York.The', 'only', 'disappointment', 'DVD', 'was', 'control', 'makers', 'DVD', 'HOW', 'do', 'present', 'Seahawks', 'fans', 'NFL', 'championship', 'game', 'was', 'openly', 'deliberately', 'thrown', 'Steelers', 'biased', 'officiating', 'was', 'getting', 'game', 'was', 'complete', 'total', 'utter', 'travesty', 'justice', 'sportsmanship', 'lost', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'respect', 'NFL', 'day']",NFL - Seattle Seahawks 2005 NFC Champions
