697148,A3W4GJR5CCADBX,B0000640S9,"""50cent-haircut""","[0, 0]","This film made my stomach turn and heart beat faster. I've never seen pain and torture portrayed so graphically, yet so... enlighteningly onscreen.The film starts out as an ordinary tale of a widowed film producer who is encouraged by his son to date and marry again. He uses film auditions as an alibi for him to pick an ideal woman. And falls immediately under one girl's spell. This is developed as a traditional story, and makes up 2/3 of the movie. Then the film does one of the most insane 180 degrees, as the main protagonist finds out the horrible, scarred past of his new girlfriend, and is exposed to an unbelievably graphic series of tortures put upon by her. The last 30 minutes of the film are nightmarishly surreal. I thought I couldn't finish the movie because of its harsh violence, but I could not let myself not watch it, because under the context, this violence was necessary. The filmmaker completely subverts all our expectations and turns what started out as an ordinary, machismo-driven film into an exact opposite: one of the most scathing and scary cautionary tales ever on the cruel and flippant male sexual politics. It can even be called a feminist statement, as long as the psycopath girl is viewed as the avenger femme fatale. It's a brilliant move. The violence is real, but it's tempered by shots of tremendous poetry and lyricism.The psychological acuity of the director Miike is amazing, and the surreal sequences that mix real events and the subconscious of the characters have the true, sublime power of a real, horrifying dream. I haven't seen dream sequences handled with such agility since David Lynch's best work. There are loose ends and things left unclear, but it is obvious that is the intention of the filmmaker. Only after viewing the film did I realize the film was based on a story by Ryu Murakami, a postmodern Japanese writer of immense talent who does not yield easily to the readers' expectations.This is not a film you can easily love, but nonetheless, it is a remarkable testament that a film can still be made without compromising its integrity and honesty. And it's not a surprise to me that such a film is a product from outside of Hollywood.

697152,A34VV92TSLC37R,B0000640S9,Adam Craig,"[1, 5]","Audition has one of the most glowing reputations of any foreign horror film.  Everytime I tell someone that I am a horror fan, most of the time I get the response:  ""Have you seen Audition?!?!?!""  Well, I can finally say yes.  And I must say that I was a little disappointed with the results.  It would have been much better for me to watch the film without having any preconceived notions, but as I must review the film as is, I'd have to say it was disappointing.The film is very Hitchcockian, in the fact that Miike takes something that seems normal and boring and, by the end of the film, turns into something absolutely horrible.  We are introduced to the main character as his wife dies, then, as we are propelled ahead 7 years, the widower goes to a friend and tells him he wants to remarry.  The friend decides to use a fake audition so the man can find himself the perfect mate.  The widower (I think his name was Aoyami...) picks a girl and starts to become pretty serious.  Basically the whole film is the development of their relationship with each other, and the last half hour of the film is devoted to the underlying horror that has been building for the past hour and a half.I won't reveal anything about the film's final 20 minutes, but I will say that it had me squirming in my seat.  I can now see why Eli Roth chose to have Takashi Miike have a cameo appearance in Hostel.  Overall, though, the film was pretty boring up until the end, and it all felt pretty pointless to me.  Especially after hearing that Miike himself has said that the film is meant to have no social commentary.  If that is so, then Miike is truly using horrific violence for no reason at all.  Maybe just for the shock value, and that is no reason, in my opinion, to display horrific torture such as is displayed in the film's finale.  I'm not one of these anti-blood, anti-violence people, I love good violence in film, but my problem with Audition was just that the violence was borderline offensive and, as I said earlier, appears to serve no purpose whatsoever.The quality of the film is definitely high, and the last scene did do its job of making me extremely uncomfortable.

You see this girl actually is insane due to years of torture and rape by a realitive. What is most disturbing is I actually believe she thinks torture is pleasure, murder is love, and fear is joy.In the last fifteen minutes of this film, the torture is so sick and twisted it made my toes curl.  The needles under the eyelids, gave me a headache, and the guy that came out of the burlap sack with missing libs and tongue really freaked me out when he ate her bowl of vomit.This movie is like the asian Fatal Attraction meets Hostel and is well worth the money I spent.

This movie takes some patience to watch, but Miike, working from a script by Daisuke Tengan, has the story unfold in richly developed stages, starting with a lonely man, Aoyama, and his son, then gently exploring the nascent relationship Aoyama has with the beautiful and seemingly sweet Asami.  About halfway into the movie, however, the dreamy love story turns into a nightmare, with the heretofore linear narrative bending and breaking, bludgeoning the viewer with illusions, flashbacks, and warped color pallets, all capped by a crescendo of violence and brutality that hits even harder due to its simplicity and the mutual downfall of characters we've grown to know and really care about.Shout Factory's presentation is the uncut, 115-minute version, with Japanese language and English subtitles.  Thankfully, the DVD goes straight to the film menu when played, sparing the viewer the endless barrage of previews that most DVD release companies insist on including, and when the movie is played, all we have to contend with is a brief 1:18 minute introduction from both Takashi Miike, who comes across as charmingly uneasy on the other side of the camera, and Eihi Shiina, who plays Asami.  The first disc features an audio commentary from Miike as well as screenwriter Tengan.  While Miike typically receives the majority of the praise given to his movies, as the screenwriter Tengan deserves much of the credit as well, so it's good to see him involved in the commentary.  The second disc features an additional 90 minutes of new interviews with cast members and two trailers.Aside from the top-notch DVD presentation, Shout Factory has done a fantastic job of packaging this movie as well.  The insert booklet features an incisive essay by Tom Mes, who seems to be a Miike scholar, and the essay easily enriches the movie by pithily investigating and analyzing a number of the themes contained there, offering a particularly intelligent reassessment of the violence of the movie and what it could represent.  The essay booklet, along with the 2 DVDs, is packaged in a standard-size clear 2-disc case with attractive double-sided artwork, and this in turn is housed in a slipcase that replicates the DVD cover art.  The devotion and attention given to the packaging as well as the DVD content certainly befits this movie, which seems to get better every time I watch it.

697157,AF1VHA7BVWLO1,B0000640S9,Alexia Komaux,"[7, 10]","Miike Takashi's film is a superb example of the increasingly popular genre now as 'J Horror' Although I should point out that it is not a good starting place for newcomers. The tone of Audition is quite remarkable. It starts off as a film about a widower who runs a small business.His teenage son thinks that dad should start looking for a new wife. Further egged on by a film producer friend of his, they put together an audition for young, attractive actresses for a film role that does not exist.It is said that these kind of fake auditions are often used by men in the film industry looking for a new girlfriend or more commonly, a mistress.If the girl they date mentions the role, they claim there is trouble with the financing that has delayed the whole project.The irony here is that the main protagonist is clearly uncomfortable with lying, and has his arm twisted to go along. The girl he does fall for and subsequently dates, seems a little odd but with great depth to her character. What slowly unfolds is that this girl has gone through hell.Sadistically abused whilst practicing ballet for her disabled and [...] uncle. She later suffers the trauma of having to completely give up dance by an injury. She is well aware of how budding young women like herself are used.What we see unfold is her turning the tables.For me, what works best about Audition is the subtle clues it gives you, as it moves towards what you expect to be a disturbing finale.Well, it does not disappoint..The girl has an ingenious way of getting even with men who would use her.Ingenious, immaculately planned and so cruel as has to be seen to be believed.I can't help wonder why it is only in the far east they seem to able to make extreme movies that are so superbly produced and acted.Half way through, you could be forgiven for thinking that this film is a romantic drama. Yet by the end, everything makes sense in a satisfying way that is too often absent in western horror /thrillers. For me, I found it a fascinating study of the everyday duplicity and lies that we are all engaged in to get what we want.

The director is able to play with your emotions as few other artists are able, regardless of artistic genre.  If you haven't seen the movie yet, don't read these reviews - they can only diminish or intellectualize the experience.I don't think it's fair to compare this movie to other horror movies, as some of the other reviews have done, or to question the plausibility of an ex-ballerina going postal, which isn't the point.  Rather, it's a sick joke being played on the audience.  Miike shows amazing range as he's able to create a perfectly acceptable, even compelling romantic comedy, and then slips the rug from under the audience, turning it into something so much more horrific than any straight horror movie could be.  I remember a NY Times review, which (favorably) compared this movie to Maria suddenly joining the Nazis somewhere around the Sound of Music's intermission, than going after the van Trapp family with a machine gun...The movie was made with great craft and restraint (two words not to be associated with other Miike flicks), and as such bears repeated viewings.

Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[5, 8]","After seeing this, I'm convinced that not only is Takashi Miike a thoroughly disturbed individual, but as brilliant a horror director as there is. He doesn't need monsters, or constant scenes of death and destruction (though he does do this in some of his movies). He can use innocent moments and sweet, lonely girls to achieve the horrifying effect that all of his movies seem to have. Audition is that movie. It starts out actually kind of sweet, and remains that way for more than half the movie, slowly drawing us into the romance between the two main characters, until that final, blood-soaked moment at the end.As I said, Audition starts out innocently, with a man named Aoyamo grieving the death of his wife and accepting the responsibility of raising his son all his own. And this, he excels at. Everything he does is for his son, and, seven years after the death of his wife, he has more of a deep friendship with his son. So, when his son recommends that his father remarry, the widower follows the advice, and asks a friend for help. The friend, a man whose job is casting films, decides that they should hold a fake audition for a romance movie, and thus Asami, a gorgeous young woman, enters the movie. Slowly yet surely, Aoyama falls for this mysterious woman, whose past does not exactly add up to the ""facts"" she provided during the audition, something he ignores. While the movie plays out, we see him getting drawn closer and closer to this dangerous woman until ""it"" happens.The movie has moments that carry us from scene to scene that constantly reminds us that, ""Yes, this movie is a horror film, and just so you don't forget, have this...."" Two scenes in particular jump out at me, one I call the ""Jumping Sack"" and the other ""The Tongue."" After seeing these scenes, I knew what I saw yet I was still unsure and I had to go back and check and see if the horrifying feeling I had in my gut was justified. It was, both times, and many more after that. That's basically how the movie carries itself up until the torture scenes at the end, with gut-wrenching and startling moments of pain or torture that last no more than a blink. But it's enough. The ending itself is one long moment like this, where you can't help but watch yet you feel terrible for doing so (whether it's in your mind or in your stomach, you'll definitely feel something).This movie was considered one of the top twenty horror films made in the last fifty years by Bravo, and after watching it you'll know why. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Takahashi Miike, because it takes a true fan to enjoy his movies to the fullest. I'd also recommend this movie to anyone who a) doesn't mind feeling disturbed and, b) can't take the constant failures that American horror movie-makers are pumping out on a monthly basis.",5,Sickening and Sweet,1136592000,"01 7, 2006",2006,2821,"['seeing', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'not', 'only', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'thoroughly', 'disturbed', 'individual', 'brilliant', 'horror', 'director', ""n't"", 'need', 'monsters', 'constant', 'scenes', 'death', 'destruction', 'do', 'movies', 'can', 'use', 'innocent', 'moments', 'sweet', 'lonely', 'girls', 'achieve', 'horrifying', 'effect', 'movies', 'seem', 'have', 'Audition', 'movie', 'out', 'actually', 'kind', 'sweet', 'way', 'more', 'movie', 'slowly', 'drawing', 'romance', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'final', 'blood-soaked', 'moment', 'end.As', 'said', 'Audition', 'out', 'innocently', 'man', 'named', 'Aoyamo', 'grieving', 'death', 'wife', 'accepting', 'responsibility', 'raising', 'son', 'own', 'Everything', 'son', 'seven', 'years', 'death', 'wife', 'more', 'deep', 'friendship', 'son', 'So', 'when', 'son', 'father', 'remarry', 'widower', 'advice', 'friend', 'help', 'friend', 'man', 'job', 'casting', 'films', 'decides', 'should', 'hold', 'fake', 'audition', 'romance', 'movie', 'thus', 'Asami', 'gorgeous', 'young', 'woman', 'movie', 'Slowly', 'yet', 'surely', 'Aoyama', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'past', 'not', 'exactly', 'add', 'up', 'facts', 'provided', 'audition', 'something', 'movie', 'out', 'see', 'getting', 'drawn', 'closer', 'closer', 'dangerous', 'woman', 'happens.The', 'movie', 'moments', 'carry', 'scene', 'scene', 'constantly', 'Yes', 'movie', 'horror', 'film', 'just', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'have', 'Two', 'scenes', 'particular', 'jump', 'out', 'one', 'call', 'Jumping', 'Sack', 'other', 'Tongue', 'seeing', 'scenes', 'knew', 'what', 'saw', 'yet', 'was', 'still', 'unsure', 'had', 'go', 'back', 'check', 'see', 'horrifying', 'feeling', 'had', 'gut', 'was', 'justified', 'was', 'times', 'many', 'more', 'basically', 'how', 'movie', 'up', 'torture', 'end', 'gut-wrenching', 'startling', 'moments', 'pain', 'torture', 'last', 'more', 'blink', 'enough', 'ending', 'one', 'long', 'moment', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'watch', 'yet', 'feel', 'terrible', 'doing', 'so', 'mind', 'stomach', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'feel', 'something', '.This', 'movie', 'was', 'considered', 'one', 'top', 'twenty', 'horror', 'films', 'made', 'last', 'fifty', 'years', 'Bravo', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'know', 'why', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'Takahashi', 'Miike', 'true', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'fullest', ""'d"", 'also', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'mind', 'feeling', 'disturbed', 'b', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'constant', 'failures', 'American', 'horror', 'movie-makers', 'are', 'pumping', 'out', 'monthly', 'basis']",N/A

Of course Aoyama's collegues can sense bad juju radiating from Asami: an actress with no agent, contacts or associates- in fact nobody appears to have heard of her. In fact Asami has a traumatic past which has scarred her for life and below the surface of that pretty face.... you can guess the rest. But the rest is a big surprise. Trust me.AUDITION is brilliantly filmed, intelligent, dark, funny with some rather unsettling scenes including a grisly garotting, impromptu tongue piercing, and an extremely sadistic acupuncture session. But I won't spoil all the gruesome details, you'll have to see for yourself. AUDITION is a true masterpiece but not recommended for the squeamish.

697171,A20IIR0422G3A5,B0000640S9,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[0, 0]","`Audition', directed by the very accomplished Japanese director, Takashi Miike is an exceptionally good horror movie, which more than makes up for all those dreadful `Godzilla' hack jobs from Japan. It is no surprise whatsoever that it came in at number 11 in Bravo's top 100 scariest horror movies, beaten out by only the cream of the crop like `Carrie', `The Exorcist', `The Shining', `Alien', and `Jaws'.It's noteworthy that unlike all but `Jaws', these horror leaders all rely on some kind of supernatural agent or ability, even those penned by Stephen King, the master of eliciting horror from the ordinary. `Audition' begins with the most ordinary of premises, a lonely man who is still recovering from the death of his wife seven years ago. The story also happens to use the conceit of a movie within a movie, as the principle male character, the lonely man, is a film director, who hits upon the device of an audition for a fictional film to locate a suitable young woman with whom he can form a romantic relation.As the director freely admits, the first half of the movie goes very slowly, giving practically no hint of the menace to come. This may be the film's one weakness, as in all the other films mentioned above, the buildup of anticipation is steady, with especial skill applied to ratching up the tension in carefully metered scenes. In `Audition', the premonition of terror hits you like a sledgehammer about half way through the movie. From then on, the only flaw in the suspense is the ambiguity in whether the scenes are real or dream. This is especially true since in other films, Miike has build the entire story within dreams, a fact revealed only at the very end of the film.Almost all the film's weaknesses fall away when we reach the climactic scene, and we get a taste of horror that puts scenes such as those in the `Saw' flicks to shame. Aside from the originality, the scene gains much from the length of the scene. There is no quick and done tummy burst or gym firestorm here. The scene goes on and on and on, and from lead-in events, one has the unpleasant experience of knowing what's coming, and you know the victim can do nothing about it, and does not know what's coming.The movie may be imperfect, but it is a paradigm of how to do really good `naturalistic' horror scenes without the need of a 24-foot shark named `Bruce'.

The beginning of the movie reveals the life of the man and his son, in a family context. Everything is so peaceful and quiet that you doubt whether it's the correct film that you put on. But, yes, it's the right film.As we see scenes where the previous life of the young woman is revealed, the tension suddenly forms and mounts. Despite his friend's warnings, the man decides to take his relationship with the woman further. They see each other more frequently. And the rest of the movie is totally insane; differently insane, though.The editing and montage of the film has been perfectly done; the ideas are clearly expressed, and visual cues are provided in all cases, where one might need to remember a particular previous scene. The movie, in general, is not  a horror movie. It is actually anything other than horror movie, for it depicts sincere family relations, love, dismal life conditions.

It reminds me of notorious serial killers such as Ted Bundy. He also looked loveable and well-mannered as the killer here. People could not detect Ted's dark side by examining his appearance. The same thing happened in this film. This is one of the reasons why it still scares the wits out of me for a long time after it ended. It's so close to reality.Of course, other pictures had terrifying scenes too but most of them were related to ghosts, devils or paranormal entities. Here, we were dealing with human beings with extremely twisted minds. It truly reflected the killings executed by serial killers in real life.The acting of the main characters played by Ryo Ishibashi, and Eihi Shiina was superb.  They made it suspenseful, credible and frightening.The director paid attention to details of human's actions and psychology. For example in one scene, the main male character was restless. He was torn between calling the audition applicant he liked and not calling her. He promised his friend not to call her but in his heart he did want to. He walked back and forth. He picked up the phone then put it back to its cradle, etc. Those actions were very much like those of an ordinary person. They struck a chord with me.The director also gave the main actors enough time to develop their characters. This made the movie deeper. Some people might think it made the pace slow but I thought it was okay.It also had more than a couple of twists that made me shudder and caught me completely by surprise.Because of the nature of horror movies, the less you know about it in advance, the more you will enjoy it.

The idea of a female who tortures her male suitors promises some interest, but what you get here is disturbing violence that makes Stephen King's ""Misery"" look like a respite care ward.  The first half of the movie is quite enjoyable and coherent. However, it becomes increasingly surrealistic towards the end with dream and reality becoming blurred.

697183,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B0000640S9,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[3, 9]","I'm not saying that I didn't want to see this film, simply that I was badgered into it by a girl I work with. My resistance lasted almost a month before I caved and finally sat down to watch it. Afterwards I tried to figure out why she recommended it and I'm still not quite sure, but my only guess is that it's because she's never seen anything quite like it. The film starts off with a plot similar to ""The Producers,"" only with the objective being love as opposed to money. A lonely man will cook up a fake movie and hold auditions for it. Once he finds the girl he will win her heart (no problem), and then make the movie anyways just to perpetuate the ruse. But because this is a Takashi Miike film the hero (and the audience) get far more than they bargain for.The main idea of the film seems to be: ""Don't chase the fresh booty."" Aoyama picks a girl from his pile of headshots and basically decides that she will be his bride. From there he begins a disturbing obsession with her. Much is made of the fact that she is significantly younger than he is. Film really has a knack for hating on sex, but since people actually enjoy it they continue to sell it. Even films that are based around sex (""Unfaithful"" and ""Vanilla Sky"" leap to mind) compromise that fact by preaching the evils or sex (especially if it casual). Here Miike actually portrays the young girl as a violent, sociopathic monster, which I saw as a wee bit heavy handed. My dad was seriously bamboozled by a younger woman, so I know the dangers of this particular creature first hand. I'm simply saying that you can pump out all the cautionary tales in the world about sex, but it won't make a difference because people are people. Nobody likes growing old and everybody likes younger sex partners.The end of the film turns into a jumbled mess in which reality has no meaning. This hurts the film because as I lost track of the action I continued to lose interest. Going in I thought I was going to be treated to extreme violence ""Ichi the Killer"" style, but since it doesn't show up until the final fourth of the film I thought for a while that I was mistaken. As far as that violence goes I consider it a net plus in this case. Its screen time is kept low and we actually have context to go with it (unlike ""Ichi the Killer""). It also creates some truly disturbing and original images that I guarantee will stick with you. If we are going to go with the idea that the violence did occur, and I'm not ready to make that jump, then the justification seems to be that the girl wants revenge on Aoyama because casting agents use their power to sleep with actresses (I guess). But that's a lot of nonsense since acting is such a greedy, self-centered profession that the girls who engage in that behavior are just as guilty. Also, Aoyama was looking for love not sex. His methods may have been a bit unorthodox, but what's a more honorable goal than love? The film also quickly delves into the nature of obsession (Aoyama really needed to get a clue and get off the case), and the thin line between pleasure and pain. Neither of these themes are ever really explored. Still I can't help but think that my dad would've benefited from seeing this film before he got married a second time. As for me, you have no reason to worry, the girl who I caved for is a few years older than I. **3/4",3,Or Why I Started Dating Older Women,1155945600,"08 19, 2006",2006,3354,"[""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'film', 'simply', 'was', 'badgered', 'girl', 'work', 'resistance', 'lasted', 'almost', 'month', 'caved', 'finally', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'Afterwards', 'tried', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'recommended', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'only', 'guess', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'quite', 'film', 'plot', 'similar', 'Producers', 'only', 'objective', 'being', 'love', 'opposed', 'money', 'A', 'lonely', 'man', 'will', 'cook', 'up', 'fake', 'movie', 'hold', 'auditions', 'Once', 'girl', 'will', 'win', 'heart', 'problem', 'then', 'make', 'movie', 'just', 'perpetuate', 'ruse', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'film', 'hero', 'audience', 'get', 'far', 'more', 'bargain', 'for.The', 'main', 'idea', 'film', 'be', 'Do', ""n't"", 'chase', 'fresh', 'booty', 'Aoyama', 'girl', 'pile', 'headshots', 'basically', 'decides', 'will', 'be', 'bride', 'disturbing', 'obsession', 'Much', 'made', 'fact', 'significantly', 'younger', 'Film', 'really', 'knack', 'hating', 'sex', 'people', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'continue', 'sell', 'Even', 'films', 'are', 'based', 'sex', 'Unfaithful', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'leap', 'mind', 'compromise', 'fact', 'preaching', 'evils', 'sex', 'especially', 'casual', 'Here', 'Miike', 'actually', 'young', 'girl', 'violent', 'sociopathic', 'monster', 'saw', 'wee', 'bit', 'heavy', 'handed', 'dad', 'was', 'seriously', 'bamboozled', 'younger', 'woman', 'know', 'dangers', 'particular', 'creature', 'first', 'hand', ""'m"", 'simply', 'saying', 'can', 'pump', 'out', 'cautionary', 'tales', 'world', 'sex', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'difference', 'people', 'are', 'people', 'Nobody', 'growing', 'old', 'everybody', 'likes', 'younger', 'sex', 'partners.The', 'end', 'film', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'reality', 'meaning', 'film', 'lost', 'track', 'action', 'continued', 'lose', 'interest', 'Going', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'treated', 'extreme', 'violence', 'Ichi', 'Killer', 'style', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'final', 'fourth', 'film', 'thought', 'while', 'was', 'mistaken', 'As', 'far', 'violence', 'consider', 'net', 'plus', 'case', 'screen', 'time', 'kept', 'low', 'actually', 'have', 'context', 'go', 'Ichi', 'Killer', 'also', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'original', 'images', 'guarantee', 'will', 'stick', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'idea', 'violence', 'did', 'occur', ""'m"", 'not', 'ready', 'make', 'jump', 'then', 'justification', 'be', 'girl', 'revenge', 'Aoyama', 'casting', 'agents', 'use', 'power', 'sleep', 'actresses', 'guess', 'lot', 'nonsense', 'acting', 'such', 'greedy', 'self-centered', 'profession', 'girls', 'who', 'engage', 'behavior', 'are', 'just', 'guilty', 'Also', 'Aoyama', 'was', 'looking', 'love', 'not', 'sex', 'methods', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'unorthodox', 'what', 'more', 'honorable', 'goal', 'love', 'film', 'also', 'quickly', 'nature', 'obsession', 'Aoyama', 'really', 'needed', 'get', 'clue', 'get', 'off', 'case', 'thin', 'line', 'pleasure', 'pain', 'themes', 'are', 'ever', 'really', 'explored', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'dad', 'would', ""'ve"", 'benefited', 'seeing', 'film', 'got', 'married', 'second', 'time', 'have', 'reason', 'worry', 'girl', 'who', 'caved', 'few', 'years', 'older', '**3/4']",N/A

You think you are watching one type of movie for the first seventy-minutes, only to be painfully, shockingly jolted into another kind of film for the last twenty.

The performances are perfectly under-played, and Miike times his low-beat revelations (""Dad, I brought home a girlfriend"") just right. Unfortunately, this is all done merely to set a trap for the audience, but I found myself wondering what Miike could achieve if he left behind the fantastic elements he seems so addicted to and set out purely to explore the kind of domestic drama he sets up so convincingly in the first two acts here. He seems to be trying to be David Lynch, but maybe his true talent is to be Ozu. Miike has his niche audience and they love the trademark stuff he delivers in the last 20 minutes.

Hamlow,"[3, 19]","Seven years after his wife Yoko died, the middle-aged Shigeharu Aoyama is encouraged by his son Shigehiko and his video production colleague Yasuhisa Yoshikawa to get remarried.  Aoyama is picky, though.  He wants someone who has special talents, such as dancing, singing, and being able to play the piano, using Yoko as an example.  He says &quot;Certain training gives people confidence.  A lack of confidence brings unhappiness.&quot;The solution is to use an old romantic triangle script as a ruse and to audition women.  Based on the interviews, Aoyama can choose one of them.  He is taken by one Asami Yamasaki, a 24-year old girl whose aspiring career as a ballerina was nipped in the bud by an injury at eighteen.  She is beautiful, classy, and obedient, but something about Asami makes Yoshikawa nervous.  &quot;Something chemical.  I just don't like her,&quot; he says.  Not only that, but there is nobody who can vouch for her employment history, nor anyone who knows her.  Aoyama is undeterred and proceeds to meet her.  It turns out that he should have heeded his friend's advice.  However, the montage of questions posed by Yoshikawa and the aspiring talents respond to his questions or demonstrate their abilities is a humorous moment.There are other side characters stricken with loneliness.  One of Aoyama's female colleagues clearly has a crush on him, but he is too blind to notice.  Rie, the woman who does odd chores for him, isn't too happy with her married life.  Yoshikawa puts it well when he tells Aoyama early on that the whole of Japan is lonely, and &quot;it's like a survival game or a game of torture.&quot;  For that reason, Japan is finished, he says.I was quickly taken with the drawn-out leisurely pace of a study of loneliness, but the gruesome final quarter of the movie ruined what could have potentially been a new classic.  And I rarely take points off for an uneven switch, but this was way too much.",2,Disappointing final quarter ruins great movie,1061424000,"08 21, 2003",2003,1941,"['Seven', 'years', 'wife', 'Yoko', 'died', 'middle-aged', 'Shigeharu', 'Aoyama', 'encouraged', 'son', 'Shigehiko', 'video', 'production', 'colleague', 'Yasuhisa', 'Yoshikawa', 'get', 'remarried', 'Aoyama', 'picky', 'though', 'someone', 'who', 'special', 'talents', 'such', 'dancing', 'singing', 'being', 'able', 'play', 'piano', 'using', 'Yoko', 'example', 'quot', 'Certain', 'training', 'people', 'confidence', 'lack', 'confidence', 'brings', 'unhappiness.', 'quot', 'solution', 'use', 'old', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'script', 'ruse', 'audition', 'women', 'Based', 'interviews', 'Aoyama', 'can', 'choose', 'one', 'taken', 'one', 'Asami', 'Yamasaki', '24-year', 'old', 'girl', 'aspiring', 'career', 'ballerina', 'was', 'nipped', 'bud', 'injury', 'eighteen', 'beautiful', 'classy', 'obedient', 'something', 'Asami', 'Yoshikawa', 'nervous', 'quot', 'Something', 'chemical', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'quot', 'Not', 'only', 'nobody', 'who', 'can', 'vouch', 'employment', 'history', 'anyone', 'who', 'Aoyama', 'undeterred', 'proceeds', 'meet', 'out', 'should', 'have', 'heeded', 'friend', 'advice', 'However', 'montage', 'questions', 'posed', 'Yoshikawa', 'aspiring', 'talents', 'respond', 'questions', 'demonstrate', 'abilities', 'humorous', 'moment.There', 'are', 'other', 'side', 'characters', 'stricken', 'loneliness', 'One', 'Aoyama', 'female', 'colleagues', 'clearly', 'crush', 'too', 'blind', 'notice', 'Rie', 'woman', 'who', 'odd', 'chores', ""n't"", 'too', 'happy', 'married', 'life', 'Yoshikawa', 'well', 'when', 'Aoyama', 'early', 'whole', 'Japan', 'lonely', 'quot', 'survival', 'game', 'game', 'torture.', 'quot', 'reason', 'Japan', 'finished', 'says.I', 'was', 'quickly', 'taken', 'drawn-out', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'study', 'loneliness', 'gruesome', 'final', 'quarter', 'movie', 'ruined', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'potentially', 'been', 'new', 'classic', 'rarely', 'take', 'points', 'off', 'uneven', 'switch', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'much']",N/A

It is a film about loneliness, abuse, deception and (oddly enough) hope. Although there are no protagonists in this film, and though the somewhat pitiful femme fatale gets her point across with razor wire and needles, you feel sympathy for the characters involved because the true enemy is circumstance, and it is through circumstance (mainly Asomi's tragic past) that the male lead is drawn however subtly into his inevitable downward spiral.

She seems the perfect mate -- don't they all at first. Audition is compelling storytelling: the lonely search for true love where a couples expectations clash . . . in this case cut to the bone! And I thought my first wife was a creep; she's Mother Theresa compared to the film's heroine. What starts as a search for love spirals into a nightmare of torture. Someone said this film is in the tradition of Vanishing, and I see the point. For in Audition a person's appearance can hide what lies deep underneath. I also agree with another reviewer's point that Audition is a metaphor for miscommunication between the sexes. We're all talking to one another. The problem is we use different scripts. This is an interesting film. It would be hard to classify it in a particular genre. Maybe Romeo and Juliet meets The Texas Chainsaw Massacare.

After confessing that he'd like to marry again, he lets a smarmy friend convince him to use a film audition to pick out a potential wife. He's  instantly attracted to Asami, a former ballerina who he senses has lived through pain and loss like he has. They begin a hurried love affair, and Aoyama is ready to propose before they spend their first night together. However, Asami disappears during the night, and the film takes a completely bizarre turn.My interpretation is that Aoyama is a man who has learned to equate love with suffering. Losing his wife has left him an emotional cripple, so in his dreams (or fantasies) his new love, Asami, who appears sweet and gentle, is actually a twisted sadist who will torture and cripple him as well.

It slowly pulls the audience into a lonely widower's world ...Years after the death of his wife, Shigeharu Aoyama begins seeking a new  companion but to little avail. Both he and his friend lament the disappearance of the traditional Japanese woman: one who is trained in the arts, is demure, and graceful. Aoyama's friend is involved in film-casting and arranges an ""audition"" for Aoyama's potential mate: only the women do not know they are being auditioned for the role of ""girlfriend."" It is here where Aoyama meets his perfect woman . . . or is she?What is important to know: the film is deliciously slow. It reads like a drama. And, a compelling one at that! Then ... the last twenty minutes are like successive punches to the face. They are ABSOLUTELY shocking ... nearly unbearable! But, if you require immediate gratification, this film is not for you. It is a film about human drama ... the build-up to the grand finale is very long, very deliberate. (And, it is this exact reason why the film is so very startling!!)The cinematography is gorgeous. The soundtrack is thoughtful. The acting is impeccable. The audience genuinely cares for these characters (even Asumi). And while Aoyama may have approached finding a new love in a dishonest manner, he certainly does not deserve the grotesque, unspeakable, impending violence. Our sympathies lie with him. And, even in the final scene (without giving away ANYTHING!), Miike Takashi explains that Aoyama looks to Asami with forgiveness and tenderness (found in director's commentary).What is most startling is that Miike Takashi HIMSELF has explained that the young woman who plays Asami Yamazaki is a method actress, so the vomit scene is REAL!! (Listen to the director's commentary for details!!) Just thought you should know;)This film is a cautionary tale both about the pitfalls of adhering to ""tradition"" at all costs.Suggested reading: Hantke, Steffen.

Takashi  Miike.A widower of 7 years, Shigeharu Aoyama (Ishibashi) starts looking again.  Reluctant to use the normal channels (understandably, in my view) he has a friend set up a phony audition for a TV film, as a way of interviewing 30 eligible young women.  The strategy works.  He meets Asami Yamazaki (Shiina) - and she meets his requirements.  She is demure, sensitive, educated, with a mature, somewhat pessimistic sensibility, to which Aoyama is drawn.  She is responsive to his interest.  And then it all goes horribly wrong.  The film isn't exactly a horror movie, though.  It's more of a short story which goes gorily surreal.  The first three-quarters or so are shot at a leisurely pace, and constitute an engaging investigation of Aoyama's situation, with a good cameo by his cynical, ever-smoking friend (Kunimura), whose uneasy warnings fall on deaf ears, even though Aoyama has similar intuitions himself.  The film is cinematically well-made, although a more rigorous approach to framing and composing every shot would have been an alternative approach.  Director Miike is apparently a busy man, however, and perhaps he was in a bit of a hurry.  Anyway, the light comedy seeps out of the film, continuity and point of view are fragmented and the spooky moments mount up (including one real eye-opener) as we follow a somewhat tortuous progress to the torturous finale where Aoyama is confronted by the monster Asami.  The ending may have a little too much grue for some.  Extreme depictions of violence seem to be a Japanese national characteristic (probably the direct consequence of their excessive politeness and unnaturally low crime rate, which would seem to stimulate these fermented fantasies).  Despite the weirdness, however, ""Audition"" retains psychological plausibility, particularly with regard to Asami.  Her character confronts the viewer.  We are given no explanation of her motives - beyond a fairly superficial hint at abuse as a child.  The suggestion that she is taking revenge on behalf of Japanese women for their treatment by the patriarchy is obviously ham-fisted (and besides, one could argue that in Japan everyone is oppressed by society) - but in a strange way there is something to it.  Does Asami have some kind of grounds for her revenges?  Is Aoyama guilty?  For manipulating women?  Or just being a complacent bourgeois male?  These notions at least get a toehold; they wouldn't if the roles were reversed.  Perhaps we tend to cut villainous females a little more slack than their male counterparts.  Overall, a good film, provocative and worth seeing, but not for the faint of stomach.",4,Chiller...,1038268800,"11 26, 2002",2002,2697,"['Audition', '1999', 'Ryo', 'Ishibashi', 'Eihi', 'Shiina', 'Jun', 'Kunimura', 'dir', 'Takashi', 'Miike.A', 'widower', '7', 'years', 'Shigeharu', 'Aoyama', 'Ishibashi', 'looking', 'again', 'Reluctant', 'use', 'normal', 'channels', 'understandably', 'view', 'friend', 'set', 'up', 'phony', 'audition', 'TV', 'film', 'way', 'interviewing', '30', 'eligible', 'young', 'women', 'strategy', 'Asami', 'Yamazaki', 'Shiina', 'requirements', 'demure', 'sensitive', 'educated', 'mature', 'somewhat', 'pessimistic', 'sensibility', 'Aoyama', 'drawn', 'responsive', 'interest', 'then', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'film', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'horror', 'movie', 'though', 'more', 'short', 'story', 'gorily', 'surreal', 'first', 'three-quarters', 'so', 'are', 'shot', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'constitute', 'engaging', 'investigation', 'Aoyama', 'situation', 'good', 'cameo', 'cynical', 'ever-smoking', 'friend', 'Kunimura', 'uneasy', 'warnings', 'fall', 'deaf', 'ears', 'even', 'Aoyama', 'similar', 'intuitions', 'film', 'cinematically', 'well-made', 'more', 'rigorous', 'approach', 'framing', 'composing', 'shot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'alternative', 'approach', 'Director', 'Miike', 'apparently', 'busy', 'man', 'however', 'perhaps', 'was', 'bit', 'hurry', 'Anyway', 'light', 'comedy', 'film', 'continuity', 'point', 'view', 'are', 'fragmented', 'spooky', 'moments', 'mount', 'up', 'including', 'one', 'real', 'eye-opener', 'follow', 'somewhat', 'tortuous', 'progress', 'torturous', 'finale', 'where', 'Aoyama', 'confronted', 'monster', 'Asami', 'ending', 'may', 'have', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'grue', 'Extreme', 'depictions', 'violence', 'seem', 'be', 'Japanese', 'national', 'characteristic', 'probably', 'direct', 'consequence', 'excessive', 'politeness', 'unnaturally', 'low', 'crime', 'rate', 'would', 'seem', 'stimulate', 'fermented', 'fantasies', 'weirdness', 'however', 'Audition', 'psychological', 'plausibility', 'particularly', 'regard', 'Asami', 'character', 'viewer', 'are', 'given', 'explanation', 'motives', 'fairly', 'superficial', 'hint', 'abuse', 'child', 'suggestion', 'taking', 'revenge', 'behalf', 'Japanese', 'women', 'treatment', 'patriarchy', 'obviously', 'ham-fisted', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'Japan', 'everyone', 'oppressed', 'society', 'strange', 'way', 'something', 'Does', 'Asami', 'have', 'kind', 'grounds', 'revenges', 'Aoyama', 'guilty', 'manipulating', 'women', 'just', 'being', 'complacent', 'bourgeois', 'male', 'notions', 'least', 'get', 'toehold', 'would', ""n't"", 'roles', 'were', 'reversed', 'Perhaps', 'tend', 'cut', 'villainous', 'females', 'little', 'more', 'slack', 'male', 'counterparts', 'Overall', 'good', 'film', 'provocative', 'worth', 'seeing', 'not', 'faint', 'stomach']",N/A

My friend who's a big time horror movie fan said this was a must see, too.  That cinched it.  I had to see this movie.What a disappointment...maybe it was hyped up too much.  The movie starts out almost like a romantic comedy...but then changes it's mind later to become a horror film.  It's also very slow moving with lots of quiet moments where nothing interesting is happening.I admit there is one great scene when the girlfriend is waiting by the phone for his call, hunched over in an empty room except for a long sack...then the phone rings.  What happens next is excellent especially since the scene cuts away right after...unfortunately, though, that was the only part of the movie I enjoyed.The rest of the movie drags and then towards the end, we get this super fast, acid-trip like sequence...then the drawn out torture scene...which is gruesome.  Another gruesome scene features the woman feeding someone.These two scenes grossed me out for sure...but did they scare me?  Not at all.  Instead of leaving me feeling delightfully creeped out, it just left me with gruesome images that I want to erase from my head.",1,More gruesome than scary,1224633600,"10 22, 2008",2008,1407,"['saw', 'preview', 'movie', 'BravoTV', 'where', '100', 'scariest', 'movies', 'were', 'being', 'reviewed', 'movie', 'ranked', '11', 'got', 'rave', 'reviews', 'including', 'one', 'singer/director', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'who', 'said', ""n't"", 'normally', 'get', 'scared', 'watching', 'horror', 'movies', 'movie', 'creeped', 'out', 'friend', 'who', 'big', 'time', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'said', 'was', 'must', 'see', 'too', 'cinched', 'had', 'see', 'movie.What', 'disappointment', 'maybe', 'was', 'hyped', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'out', 'almost', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'then', 'mind', 'later', 'become', 'horror', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'slow', 'moving', 'lots', 'quiet', 'moments', 'where', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'happening.I', 'admit', 'one', 'great', 'scene', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'waiting', 'phone', 'call', 'hunched', 'over', 'empty', 'room', 'long', 'sack', 'then', 'phone', 'rings', 'What', 'next', 'excellent', 'especially', 'scene', 'away', 'right', 'unfortunately', 'though', 'was', 'only', 'part', 'movie', 'enjoyed.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'drags', 'then', 'towards', 'end', 'get', 'super', 'fast', 'acid-trip', 'sequence', 'then', 'drawn', 'out', 'torture', 'scene', 'gruesome', 'gruesome', 'scene', 'woman', 'feeding', 'someone.These', 'two', 'scenes', 'grossed', 'out', 'sure', 'did', 'scare', 'Not', 'Instead', 'leaving', 'feeling', 'delightfully', 'creeped', 'out', 'just', 'left', 'gruesome', 'images', 'want', 'erase', 'head']",N/A

Rather, it's a complex look at human frailty, fear and the desire to be loved.I just saw it at a midnight screening, and the anticipation I and my friends felt was very high. Even the theatre management offered us their high praise of what they said is a very intense and unforgettable film.Unforgettable and intense would be just two words I would use to describe AUDITION. The words suspenseful, horrific, sad, creepy, and graphic also come to mind. This is not a film for younger viewers (those under 17) or those who are squeamish at all.The story revolves around a man, Aoyama(Ryo Ishibashi) who some years earlier lost his wife to illness, and had to raise their young son on his own. In the present day, his son is about 22 years old, and Aoyama is feeling old and very lonely. His business partner and he hatch a plan to find him a bride. They use the guise of casting for a film. They hold a casting call from the hundreds of interested young girls who respond to their solicitation. Ayoama, who desperately wants to find a wife, has already set his sights on one girl, Asami (Eihi Shiina) whose very touching letter he read from her resume.Asami enters the interview room dressed in virginal/angelic white, acting very humble and deferential like a traditional Japanese woman would act toward a man. She is literally a vision of beauty and peace, while there is much more to her emotionally and psychologically. The business partner tells the man there is something he feels is amiss with Asami, and recommends against choosing her. However, Aoyama is irresistibly attracted to her, and can think of nothing but phoning her to say she has the ""part"" for their fake movie.What transpires for the first half of the film is an unfolding of a potential relationship, wherein Aoyama and Asami spend hours in cafes revealing the most intimate emotions and details of their painful lives. Aoyama truly believes he is falling in love, and all will be well. He does come to tell Asami that he isn't really casting for a film, but really looking for a wife and lifelong companion. Asami then suggests they go away for a weekend away, and the downward spiral begins...What follows for the next 45 minutes or so is a collage of dream-like flashbacks (a la David Lynch), extreme violence, and a lot of ""heartbreak."" I'm not going to detail the events of the last 20 minutes as this is the point where you DEFINITELY don't want to get up and walk away from the screen. Too much happens here and if you blink, you will miss something.If you look past the graphic depiction of torture/revenge visited upon the men in this film, you will see that AUDITION is in many ways a social commentary on the modern-day perils, both real and imagined, that all people potentially encounter when they are paralyzed by their fears of loneliness, rejection and sadness.The film's key strength is its use of genuine suspense and the deliberate unfolding of one horrific image followed by something more innocent. It is this juxtaposition of horror and innocence, love and hate, revenge and desire, that draws the viewer further into the darkness that is the soul of the abused and the unloved.Recommended with a caution that is very graphic and disturbing.

Briefly, some years after the death of the protagonist's wife, he decides he might want to re-marry and goes about trying to find his ideal mate through auditioning women for a documentary about his trying to find his ideal mate. The woman he ends up falling for turns out to be a nutcase who proceeds to torture him to death ( or at least to an extreme degree of being handicapped).The problem is that this may not really be happening and may only be a nightmare. The question is, there is really nothing in the set-up to suggest the whole thing isn't happenening exactly as the audience is seeing it, so why suggest it? It is certainly  much more compelling to see this sweet (if creepy/mysterious)girl go off the deep end than to think it isn't really happening. And as you come to the end and she begs for sympathy due to her past, you are expected to forgive her for something she may not have even done.This brings to mind the film Donnie Darko, where the viewer finds he has been caught up in some alternative reality. Finally, that film probably has more questions than answers, but it contained some weird, internal logic and still left me satisfied. This film left me frustrated because it doesn't resolve the key issue of who this girl is and did these things really happen.This would have worked better as a straight-ahead thriller. It has a great premise and a really good set-up. The minor detective worked performed by the two main characters unveils some genuinely creepy things about the girl. If the director would have stuck with it to a more logical conclusion it would have been one nifty flick. As it stands, this might be one of the few films I hope Hollywood DOES attempt to re-make.

In the film ""Audition,"" what starts out as a normal date set-up for a lonely widowed man turns into the nightmare date from hell. The film takes place in Japan, where a decent and honorable man widowed for seven years is urged by his son to find a companion. Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi) is a television producer, and when he is in a bar one day, he tells this friend that he wishes society was different, and that he would like to have a traditional woman who is the stay at home type. His friend recommends that he use an audition to find the suitable partner.Since both of them work in the film business, the friend decides the Audition is the best way to find the right woman for Aoyama. Soon resumes from prospective female actors seeking the role in a film begin piling in. However, prospect after prospect is rejected by Aoyama. That is until he comes across one particular woman named Asami. The woman is very shy, and this appeals to Aoyama. However, his friend urges him to choose someone else. It dawned on me when I viewed this film a few years ago, that his friend was in the business of auditions, and apparently he saw something  that the lonely Aoyama did not. His friend even goes so far as to say that there is something wrong with her chemistry. Whatever the case, the point is Aoyama is infatuated with Asami.Therefore, Aoyama has made his decision, Asami is the one. However, there is a problem, as Asami has no address. With only her phone number, and Asami sitting all alone awaiting his call--or any call, he decides to make contact. I will not go further into the film, as this will spoil it for those who have not seen this film. I will write though that this will not be the woman of his dreams. Life will seem much fuller and joyful after he and Asami begin a very strange relationship with each other. A relationship that I might add will be very one-sided. So much for Aoyama's  plans of a coy and subservient wife. The film is more or less a drama for the first half of the film, it is the second half where a seemingly 'normal' drama makes way for horror/thriller that is truly shocking.

To those who have yet to see this film know now that you are in for a ride that you will never forget. J-Horror has become a very popular thing here in the states lately but let me say that these American remakes are nothing compared to the real deal productions from Asia. If America ever tries to remake this I may boycott what ever studio is doing it, I like this film that much. Also let me say J-Horror, K-Horror and any kind of name for a horror film from a country not your own is ridicules, I do not hear anyone here in America calling American horror films A-Horror so why can't it all be .............. HORROR. With that being said [been waiting to get that out] ""Audition"" is one of those films that just sneaks up on you, in fact if you have never seen this stop reading now and put it in, surprise awaits you.Shigeharu Aoyama played masterfully by Ryo Ishibashi is a very lonely man looking to get back out there after coming to terms with his wife's death. His best friend Yasuhisa Yoshikawa [Jun Kunimura] convinces him that having an audition for a film would be the best way to meet some women and learn a little about them. Aoyama who only has the company of his son who obviously has more to do then hang with his father eventually agrees and off the two go. It is in these interviews that a beautiful young woman named Asami Yamazaki [Eihi Shiina] walks into the room and into Aoyama life. Little did Yoshikawa know that his friend had already chosen this girl long before she auditioned. The two hit it off or so it seems because both are unsure about the other and wait for the other to make a move or call. A relationship starts to blossom despite warnings from Yoshikawa and a good movie is well on its way.Or at least one would think so if they only made it that far, because other then a scene involving Asami and a bag in the back ground this seems more like a romantic comedy [see the scene were the two friends are talking at a bar, and the audition scenes] then a horror film. To be honest, even though it seems that way it actually was working as such and would have been just as good staying that way [did that make sense], but man that throws you off for what is to come. The last 20 to 30 minutes of this film are some of the hardest things to sit threw and watch, honestly it really is. I think because the film built it's self up and seemed like such a different film, the last part of this film is heightened and these scenes seem a lot harder to view because of that. If I could describe what happens in this film to you in these written words I would. But the atmosphere and emotion add so much to the scenes that it is pretty much impossible to really convey to you how powerful they are. I hope I am not hyping these scenes up to a point that will eventually disappoint you, but I really feel that this film is a classic. Also i won't give away what happens here because you must see them for your self, trust me.Ryo Ishibashi plays the role of the lonely single father very well and is more then believable as such, in fact he is so good at it that you actually feel horrible about what happens to his character [even though you learn a few bad things about him]. Ryo has a certain boyish charm about his character that shines threw the screen and really plays it well with the female characters. Jun Kunimura who plays his best friend is just as good as the confident yet distrusting best friend, his character actually calls out the female leads shaky background to Ryo. His character is a successful and some what cocky guy who comes up with the plan for his friend to meet women, he was very right about the girl. Speaking of which Eihi Shiina is downright evil in this film and portrays her self very differently so well throughout the first 3rd of the film. Her performance is hauntingly brilliant as it is so believable and really every guys worst fear about women, which is what this film is all about. She is at times a sweet and innocent girl and a strong but giving woman at another, but towards the end she is extremely warped and sick. The thing that makes her performance so good is that she slips in and out of all these emotions of the character with such ease that you think she is really like that, she is that character. Another thing about her performance is that during those horrific torture scenes when you look into her eyes there is no emotion there, I mean the character has no emotion not the actress.Director Takashi Miike helmed in my opinion one of the greatest films ever made regardless of what country this film was made in, like I said this is not J-Horror or A-Horror it is straight up horror. Although one could argue that Miike did not create a horror film in that he really crafted a human study and hardcore tension film. Of course screenwriter Daisuke Tengan must get some credit as he pinned this wonderful film from a great novel by Ry Murakami. Both the book and the screenplay are wonderful works of art, man I hope I am not over doing this review with praise. But with that said I can't find anything wrong with this film, some say it is slow but I think the pace is the perfect build for the last 3rd of the film. But all of the film before that is a wonderful film in its own right and really deserves that credit, plus it is the perfect build for the end.I hope that I did not over do this film with praise or hyped it so much that you will go in with expectations that could never be matched but I really believe this film is worth your time. Ask almost any one [a few poor souls actually don't get this film] who has seen this film what they think about it and I bet they say it was great. Some people I know will never watch it again because of the last part of this film in. I have to give a shout out to WP for getting me to watch this again and review it.

I thought it was overly gory, but liked various back story glimpses into the heroine's tragic past.The plot to Audition follows a middle aged businessman, Aoyama.  His wife died years ago, and now his teenage son is beginning to date and wonders why dad doesn't date and remarry too.  A co-worker who produces films plays match-maker and holds an audition for the romantic lead in a script featuring a heroine with traits Aoyama finds desirable and an age ranging from early 20s to early 30s.  The movie isn't funded, so the audition is a way to screen women for Aoyama.  Aoyama takes a shine to a girl with a past which is both sad and difficult to verify.  She seems sweet, but you know it's a horror movie.Oddly, I didn't find this movie that scarey.  It's gory, but that didn't bother me much.  What sticks with me most is the way the heroine is developed.  As she dates Aoyama and talks, she is open about her childhood.  She has a sad past with abuse and loneliness.  Later, as things move from romance to horror, it becomes clear how she brings the past with her.  Even her ultimate fate follows the same trajectory.Overall, this is a solid gore film, with gore that is simultaneously overstated and understated.  It's not a must see, but also not a waste of time.

I was overall impressed with the pacing and style of the movie, but I was a little disappointed to learn that one of my favorite parts of the movie wasn't in the original novel this movie was based on. Credit goes to Miike, the director, for the new ideas that were added to the story in this movie because the scenes that Miike added were probably the best parts. The biggest complaint I have of the movie is that the cameraman in some scenes couldn't keep the camera steady and it is shaky in a few parts. Nothing major, but it is enough to notice the picture not being steady.The special features for the DVD are a great addition and answer some questions about the movie, mainly when they interview the author of the novel. I don't know if this could be considered a horror movie, it is definitely more of a suspense story. The author of the novel, Ryu, himself said that this isn't a ghost story or about a maniac with a knife, but more about the dark side of the human heart. It's not until the last few minutes of the movie when things get really bad, most of the time it is like a normal love story with a twist. If you like thriller suspense stories like ""Psycho"" that deal with the outcome from years of abuse, then you will like this movie. But, if you want a slasher that goes for the throat, this isn't for you because this story builds up to the moment instead of going straight for the jugular. Remember, the movie isn't what I'd call ""scary"", but more disturbing than anything else and it doesn't become that until the last twenty minutes.

His mate gets the idea of having an audition of women under the pretence that its for a tv production (That way they will never know and he can look at his leasure and 'choose the best' so to speak)  So there the poor chap is when bingo! He sees her.  Quiet, modest and shy just what he is looking for.  He begins to take her out first to get to know her then later as he slowly starts to fall in love with her.Slowly but surely he begins to find that hsi little perfect find has a little bit of how shall I say cough cough baggage with her.  Abused as a child by some nut case who slashed her with heated knives she has some issues to deal with.Our hero tracks the guy down (some nut in a weelchair) as he desperately wants to find out more about her (especially after he finally sleeps with her and she disappears the next morning, never a good sign that one)Anyway he starts to give up and get on with his life when back at his home who should turn up but his little miss perfet to inflict 10 minutes of the most horrific torture on the poor guy you could imagine.I dont know if its what she does to him or her high pitched Japanese voice that just goes through you but it does make you squirm.  There is a message at the end of this film but I just didnt get it.

While this concept is somewhat interesting, the plot moves at a terribly slow and tiresome pace, being nothing more than flat mumbo-jumbo for about 3/4 of the movie.This effort is forgettable and not very enticing for the most part, presenting a japanese romantic comedy (not very funny though) about a middle-aged man that makes an audition in order to choose an actress for a movie. Simultaneously, he`s also trying to find a girfriend in the process (and he manages to get one). &quot;Audition&quot; develops this scenario and suddently delivers a strong twist that provides some shocking and disturbing scenes, giving a new perspective into the protagonist`s recent (and apparently innocent and fragile) girlfriend.Director Takashi Miike tries to raise subjects like the effects of isolation, the possibilty of love and the old &quot;looks can be decieving&quot; idea, yet this cinematic experience is flawed overall and just fails to convince.

697236,A2SRP2HP75CUVD,B0000640S9,Horror-Fanatics.com,"[3, 3]","Takashi Miike is recognized as being one of the masters in the horror genre today. With such great films like Dead or Alive, Visitor Q, Ichi The Killer, Gozu etc. Miike's name is known all over to fans and its no surprise that hes even working on the episode 'Imprint' for the Showtime horror anthology series Masters of Horror. 1999 was pretty much the breakout year for Takashi, one of the films which he released was Audition. The romantic horror/thriller which shocked many audiences all over the world. Thankfully Lions Gate was able to bring us another DVD edition for the movie. The Auditon Uncut Special Edition DVD which is just enough to please any fan of Asian cinema.Based on the novel by Ryu Murakami, Audition tells the story of a widower who is in search for love once more. After losing his wife many years, the mans son gives him an idea to look for a new companion. The lonely widower then gets together with a friend and his friend suggests that they hold a fake Audition so that he can meet new women. Once planned the two men hold an Audition for a TV movie with lots of women trying out for the lead role. Fascinated by one particular young woman, he then proceeds to ask her out on date. Sadly what the man doesn't know is that the woman is more mysterious then she looks.Being a fan of foreign films I actually had a good time watching this movie. Ive reads tons of positive reviews in the past and when I got to see it for the first time I was pretty impressed. Honestly I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about and I can really see why a lot of people dig this movie. The film is even mentioned on Bravo's 100 Scariest movie moments countdown. Audition is a film which you really need a lot of patience for. Most of the film is more of a romance and the horror doesn't really kick in until the last 15 minutes. So if you plan to see this film I highly suggest that you don't watch it for the horror aspect of it. Take the time to watch it and enjoy the characters and story.It starts off somewhat tragic and runs as a romance film. If you're a viewer who actually enjoys interesting realistic characters and plot then you wont be bored. But honestly if you have very little patience or a short attention span then you really wont enjoy this movie. There's tons of dialog and a lot of slow moments in the film. Miike's intention of the film is best explained in the bonus features. The film was made this way on purpose and its no surprise if you get bored after awhile. It was made to give you a sense of comfort for an hour or more and slap the horror in your face near the end.Most of the film is just a build up to the last few scenes and its Miike's way of shocking an audience. I think thats one of the main reasons why people love this movie so much. Sure its not as gory or disturbing as Miike's later films, but Audition isn't the kind of movie to watch for the blood and gore, just more for the psychological aspect and nightmarish turn near the end. With this latest DVD edition there really isn't much of a difference if you compare it to the other uncut DVD which came out before. It features the same length running at 115 minutes, which is two minutes more then the R rated cut of the film.Not only does the film look better in this edition but there are also some really neat special features. There's a new DVD introduction by Takashi Miike himself, select scene commentary, a sitdown interview with Miike, a photo gallery, the Bravos 100 Scariest Movie Moments segment and even an interview with the original author Ryu Murakami. If you're a fan of Miike and his work then you wont be disappointed with this Uncut Special Edition.",4,A good movie which you need a lot of patience to enjoy,1144972800,"04 14, 2006",2006,3681,"['Takashi', 'Miike', 'recognized', 'being', 'one', 'masters', 'horror', 'genre', 'today', 'such', 'great', 'films', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'Visitor', 'Q', 'Ichi', 'Killer', 'Gozu', 'etc', 'Miike', 'name', 'known', 'fans', 'surprise', 'even', 'working', 'episode', 'Showtime', 'horror', 'anthology', 'series', 'Masters', 'Horror', '1999', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'breakout', 'year', 'Takashi', 'one', 'films', 'released', 'was', 'Audition', 'romantic', 'horror/thriller', 'shocked', 'many', 'audiences', 'world', 'Thankfully', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'was', 'able', 'bring', 'DVD', 'edition', 'movie', 'Auditon', 'Uncut', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'just', 'enough', 'please', 'fan', 'Asian', 'cinema.Based', 'novel', 'Ryu', 'Murakami', 'Audition', 'story', 'widower', 'who', 'search', 'love', 'once', 'more', 'losing', 'wife', 'many', 'years', 'mans', 'son', 'idea', 'look', 'new', 'companion', 'lonely', 'widower', 'then', 'together', 'friend', 'friend', 'hold', 'fake', 'Audition', 'can', 'meet', 'new', 'women', 'Once', 'planned', 'two', 'men', 'hold', 'Audition', 'TV', 'movie', 'lots', 'women', 'trying', 'out', 'lead', 'role', 'Fascinated', 'one', 'particular', 'young', 'woman', 'then', 'ask', 'out', 'date', 'Sadly', 'what', 'man', ""n't"", 'know', 'woman', 'more', 'mysterious', 'then', 'looks.Being', 'fan', 'foreign', 'films', 'actually', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'movie', 'Ive', 'tons', 'positive', 'reviews', 'past', 'when', 'got', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'pretty', 'impressed', 'Honestly', 'just', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'why', 'lot', 'people', 'dig', 'movie', 'film', 'even', 'mentioned', 'Bravo', '100', 'Scariest', 'movie', 'moments', 'countdown', 'Audition', 'film', 'really', 'need', 'lot', 'patience', 'Most', 'film', 'more', 'romance', 'horror', ""n't"", 'really', 'kick', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'So', 'plan', 'see', 'film', 'highly', 'suggest', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'horror', 'aspect', 'Take', 'time', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'characters', 'story.It', 'off', 'somewhat', 'tragic', 'romance', 'film', ""'re"", 'viewer', 'who', 'actually', 'interesting', 'realistic', 'characters', 'plot', 'then', 'wont', 'be', 'bored', 'honestly', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'patience', 'short', 'attention', 'span', 'then', 'really', 'wont', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'tons', 'dialog', 'lot', 'slow', 'moments', 'film', 'Miike', 'intention', 'film', 'best', 'explained', 'bonus', 'features', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'way', 'purpose', 'surprise', 'get', 'bored', 'awhile', 'was', 'made', 'give', 'sense', 'comfort', 'hour', 'more', 'slap', 'horror', 'face', 'end.Most', 'film', 'just', 'build', 'up', 'last', 'few', 'scenes', 'Miike', 'way', 'shocking', 'audience', 'think', 'thats', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'why', 'people', 'love', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'Sure', 'not', 'gory', 'disturbing', 'Miike', 'later', 'films', 'Audition', ""n't"", 'kind', 'movie', 'watch', 'blood', 'gore', 'just', 'more', 'psychological', 'aspect', 'nightmarish', 'turn', 'end', 'latest', 'DVD', 'edition', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'difference', 'compare', 'other', 'uncut', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'length', 'running', '115', 'minutes', 'two', 'minutes', 'more', 'then', 'R', 'rated', 'cut', 'film.Not', 'only', 'film', 'look', 'better', 'edition', 'are', 'also', 'really', 'neat', 'special', 'features', 'new', 'DVD', 'introduction', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'select', 'scene', 'commentary', 'sitdown', 'interview', 'Miike', 'photo', 'gallery', 'Bravos', '100', 'Scariest', 'Movie', 'Moments', 'segment', 'even', 'interview', 'original', 'author', 'Ryu', 'Murakami', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Miike', 'work', 'then', 'wont', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Uncut', 'Special', 'Edition']",N/A
697237,A2B0XO8BTPRX7R,B0000640S9,Ian Vance,"[5, 8]","1999's *Audition* cemented Takashi Miike's reputation as the preeminent l'agent provocateur in Japanese cinema.  No mean feat, given that this was an industry that, thanks to a relative free-reign ethic towards censorship (only the display of genitals is a no-no), had for decades tested the boundaries of the traditional and the taboo, expounding the theme of 'eros in hell' to extreme measures.  Chalk up another entry here.  Worlds away from the yakuza genre-deconstructions of the *Dead or Alive* series, *Audition* begins deceptively low key for a Miike film, and for the first two-thirds maintains a subtle, serene composition, balancing the main thrust of the story - tentative romance between disparate individuals - with occasional hints of a far more dreadful denouement.  The meat of the film examines the fabric of power and submission in relationships, between producers and auditioning actresses, between men and women, between traditional mores and secreted desires.  Then the gloves come off and the third act puts a new spin on the catch-phrase ""damaged goods,"" evoking horror and tension - ""neutralized"" (to quote Miike) by grotesque black-humor - to an almost unbearable threshold.  It goes without saying that Miike films are not for those of weak constitution, but *Audition* succeeds above and beyond by unleashing its secrets in the final half hour, long after the audience has come to sympathize/empathize with both the main leads.  It's delayed-gratification torture, exquisite in design and all the more psychologically traumatic therein.*Audition* begins with film producer Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi) in the hospital, watching his wife succumb to a terminal illness.  We then cut to seven years later, when Aoyama's son tells his father that he should re-marry, he's ""starting to look old.""  Aoyama thinks this is good advice, but had no clue as to finding his ideal mate - one that, in his descriptions, comes off as a stock clich&eacute; of the submissive-innocent ideal.  A fellow employee comes up with an ingenious scheme: audition a number of unknown actresses for a phony movie and find one suitable for marriage.  A very funny montage of struggling Japanese actresses trying to land the part follows, but Aoyama has already made his choice in the mysterious figure of Asami Yamazaki (the gorgeous Eihi Shiina), whom he discovers when he spills coffee on her applicant sheet.  Clad in virginal white, displaying via body language the quality of the traditional submissive Japanese woman, Asami sears an unforgettable image in Aoyama's brain, though his co-worker is suspicious:  ""I don't like her...her chemistry...it's not right.""Aoyama forges on regardless, calling up the actress and carefully manipulating the relationship from the professional to the personal.  In this first half *Audition* resembles a typical romantic drama - lonely bachelor seeks young, willing partner; she, scarred by the past, responds with sweet acceptance - but the film forewarns us that things are not what they seem, explicitly in a portrait of Asami's stark living quarters, complete with a howling wind ambience and a mysterious bag on the floor that shifts and gurgles when the phone rings.  Dread seeps into the atmosphere; something sinister is afoot.  Just how sinister, however, is doled out with methodical precision, and the charisma of Ishibashi and Shiina, who exude a sweet compatibility at first, the flaws and wounds of the past inconsequential to a primal ~longing~, help distract us until the blinders are finally ripped away and the power/submissive ethic is put in stunning reverse-mode.  At this point in the DVD interview Miike admits that theatre audiences began to trickle out of the initial screenings, unable to comprehend or endure the succession of caustic images filmed in real-time.  I can't say I blame them, but I personally couldn't look away, either.Part of this is in large part due to the masterful craft of the film - cinematography, editing (ranging from understated to gut-punching) and especially the use of sound: tinkering piano conjures fuzzy sentimentality; dissonant violins build the tension; and those sound effects...! I don't think I'll ever be able to hear the phrase ""here kitty kitty"" again without thinking about this film.  The particulars of *Audition*'s cinema-construction burrow deep into the brain, like a tick or a virus, simultaneously seducing and setting bonds: this is tragic filmmaking at its best.I tend to dislike the genre of horror for its (general) cheapness of script and overall intent, its rampant copycat reiteration and stale motifs.  ~Real~ horror, to me, is the trauma that human beings inflict upon each other, both physically and psychologically, intentional or subconsciously.  With those parameters in consideration, *Audition* is one of the best ~real~ horror films I've ever seen, a romantic postcard edged with razor blades.  The fact that the end credits roll in accompanied by quasi-jazz J-pop/rock careens the whole affair into the beyond-disturbed realm.Highly recommended, with reservations.",5,A Caustic Examination of

At this point you may think ""If a film was made in the United States using this premise, It would be a romantic-comedy starring Richard Gere or Hugh Grant!"".  However, that's when the film spirals into one of the scariest and most gruesome films I have ever seen as it is soon found out that Masami has a hidden side caused by years of abuse.  If you liked films like Perfect Blue, then this film is your cup of tea.  It should be noted that when this film was first screened to international audiences at film festivals, nearly half of the audience either walked out or fainted.

697240,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B0000640S9,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[2, 2]","In my mind, Asian cinema comes up with some of the best movies you can possibly see. Unlike a lot of American cinema, Asians typically come up with extremely original and thought provoking works of art from gangster movies like Infernal Affairs, to revenge flicks like Oldboy, and even monster movies like The Host. One of the best Asian filmmakers to come out in recent years is Takashi Miike. From Ichi the Killer to the original version of One Missed Call, Takashi Miike has always been a filmmaker that helped to represent excellence. With Odishon, or Audition in English, Miike (pronounced Me-ay-kay) crafted a modern horror masterpiece that even American metal and movie horror-master Rob Zombie said messed him up when he first saw it.Audition is the story of Japanese film producer Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi). Seven years after his wife dies, Aoyama decides to find himself a new wife after the urging of his son Shigehiko Aoyama (Tetsu Sawaki). After talking to a colleague that he plans to find a new wife, his colleague comes up with the idea of holding an audition for a movie that would serve for casting the lead female role in a new movie and finding Aoyama a wife. While reviewing the candidates for the audition Aoyama comes across the profile and resume of Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina) and is struck by her picture and her life story. At the actual audition he has eyes for none of the other girls besides Asami, and when the audition is over he can hardly wait to call her. His colleague has misgivings about the girl, and despite his warnings Aoyama starts a relationship anyway.Audition starts off slow going, building up characters and relationships rather than just jumping into the horror like most American films will do. This actually really helps the horror, you actually feel for the characters so when you find them in horrific situations you truly feel the horror of what they're going through. While the movie takes a little bit of time to pick up, when it does hit, it hits hard and doesn't let go, and leaves you with that, ""WTF?!"" feeling.The acting in this movie is superb. The movie mainly follows the building relationship of Aoyama and Asami, and they play their characters deftly. Sawaki plays Aoyama as a businessman having been seven years out of the game becomes obsessed with a girl whom he thinks is perfect for him. Likable, not quite sure of the moral implications of the ""audition"", and a good father who's just lonely, Sawaki plays a character with many layers and makes the audience feel all of them. Shiina, playing Asami, plays a woman that you feel sorry for and you constantly wonder what really lies beneath the surface. Slightly creepy, damaged, and also very lonely, Shiina shows that something always lies deeper in her character while not always letting the audience into what it is.I highly recommend this movie, but it's not for everyone, it's not in English so you will have to watch it with subtitles. Also there are some very graphic torture scenes that will last in your memory. For those of you who don't mind, or enjoy that type of thing though, you will be rewarded!4/5",4,Odishon,1260316800,"12 9, 2009",2009,3142,"['mind', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'up', 'best', 'movies', 'can', 'possibly', 'see', 'lot', 'American', 'cinema', 'Asians', 'typically', 'come', 'up', 'extremely', 'original', 'thought', 'provoking', 'works', 'art', 'gangster', 'movies', 'Infernal', 'Affairs', 'revenge', 'flicks', 'Oldboy', 'even', 'monster', 'movies', 'Host', 'One', 'best', 'Asian', 'filmmakers', 'come', 'out', 'recent', 'years', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'Ichi', 'Killer', 'original', 'version', 'One', 'Missed', 'Call', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'always', 'been', 'filmmaker', 'helped', 'represent', 'excellence', 'Odishon', 'Audition', 'English', 'Miike', 'pronounced', 'Me-ay-kay', 'crafted', 'modern', 'horror', 'masterpiece', 'even', 'American', 'metal', 'movie', 'horror-master', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'said', 'messed', 'up', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'it.Audition', 'story', 'Japanese', 'film', 'producer', 'Shigeharu', 'Aoyama', 'Ryo', 'Ishibashi', 'Seven', 'years', 'wife', 'dies', 'Aoyama', 'find', 'new', 'wife', 'urging', 'son', 'Shigehiko', 'Aoyama', 'Tetsu', 'Sawaki', 'talking', 'colleague', 'find', 'new', 'wife', 'colleague', 'up', 'idea', 'holding', 'audition', 'movie', 'would', 'serve', 'casting', 'lead', 'female', 'role', 'new', 'movie', 'finding', 'Aoyama', 'wife', 'reviewing', 'candidates', 'audition', 'Aoyama', 'profile', 'resume', 'Asami', 'Yamazaki', 'Eihi', 'Shiina', 'struck', 'picture', 'life', 'story', 'actual', 'audition', 'eyes', 'none', 'other', 'girls', 'Asami', 'when', 'audition', 'can', 'hardly', 'wait', 'call', 'colleague', 'misgivings', 'girl', 'warnings', 'Aoyama', 'relationship', 'anyway.Audition', 'off', 'slow', 'going', 'building', 'up', 'characters', 'relationships', 'rather', 'just', 'jumping', 'horror', 'most', 'American', 'films', 'will', 'do', 'actually', 'really', 'horror', 'actually', 'feel', 'characters', 'so', 'when', 'find', 'horrific', 'situations', 'truly', 'feel', 'horror', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'time', 'pick', 'up', 'when', 'hit', 'hard', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'WTF', 'feeling.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'superb', 'movie', 'mainly', 'building', 'relationship', 'Aoyama', 'Asami', 'play', 'characters', 'deftly', 'Sawaki', 'Aoyama', 'businessman', 'having', 'been', 'seven', 'years', 'game', 'obsessed', 'girl', 'whom', 'perfect', 'Likable', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'moral', 'implications', 'audition', 'good', 'father', 'who', 'just', 'lonely', 'Sawaki', 'character', 'many', 'layers', 'audience', 'feel', 'Shiina', 'playing', 'Asami', 'woman', 'feel', 'sorry', 'constantly', 'wonder', 'what', 'really', 'surface', 'Slightly', 'creepy', 'damaged', 'also', 'very', 'lonely', 'Shiina', 'something', 'always', 'deeper', 'character', 'not', 'always', 'letting', 'audience', 'what', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'not', 'English', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'subtitles', 'Also', 'are', 'very', 'graphic', 'torture', 'scenes', 'will', 'last', 'memory', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'enjoy', 'type', 'thing', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', '4/5']",N/A
697241,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B0000640S9,Jason,"[2, 2]","With all the praise, I expected so much from Takashi Miike's breakout movie.  More psychological thriller than horror, I was impressed and disturbed at the same time by Audition.  Technically and creatively it is beautiful, but I've never been more pleased and disappointed by one movie.According to Miike's commentary, the heart of Audition is about family, about discovering what makes a person function by examining the relationships that define their home-life.  Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi) is a Japanese Average Joe grieving his recently deceased wife.  Aoyama bottles up his pain and loneliness, instead devoting himself to his son.  Fast forward seven years into stability and a great father-son bond, and his son recommends that his father remarry.With a casting director connection, Yasuhisa Yoshikawa (Jun Kunimura - the guy who got his head lopped off in Kill Bill), a plan is devised to find Aoyama's new woman through a fake audition.  Before seeing the pool of applicants, the two men remark societal changes, the dwindling pool of traditionally subservient women who are ""beautiful, classy and obedient"".  After reviewing several candidates, however, Aoyama sets his eyes on Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina), a pretty but haunted women whose previous aspirations to be a ballet dancer were crushed by an injury.Immediately the two find a connection and dependency through loneliness.  As intimacy increases, more of Asami's former life becomes suspect.  She's incredibly sweet and demure, but the buildup progresses slowly enough that uneasiness develops amidst the foreshadowing and hints Aoyama ignores.  Too bad for Aoyama.The first 60 minutes slowly persuade viewers into forming their own mental endings, and then Miike, through his own admission, hoped that the twist would be a ""psychological betrayal"" leaving viewers shocked.  Without going into the details of the gruesome ending, let me just say that I plan on buying a home alarm; I'll probably never go an acupuncturist; I'll always sniff my drinks before taking a gulp; and I'll always be haunted by a single Japanese word.Ishibashi is superb as the depressed Aoyama, but Shiina absolutely blew me away.  Per portrayal of a troubled psychopath is bloodcurdling.  Her ability to display either apathy or glee towards what would normally elicit nausea was brilliant.Both strength and weakness, the buildup for the final scene is difficult in two ways.  One, it's excruciatingly long.  It's probably the primary reason why this film is so polarizing.  For over an hour, the movie drags so much that the characters' pure ennui causes boredom by proxy.  On the other hand, the buildup is difficult because it allows a viewer to relate and empathize with Aoyama, to trust the rising sanguinity, making the jaw-dropping 180 so much more powerful.  It's not just a gut-punch; it's a gut-punch from your father.  It's completely unpredictable, and the surreal nature adds to the nauseous shock.Once again, I'm pleased and disappointed.  The beginning is agonizing; but, then again, that's what made me so susceptible to the surprise.  Off-hand, I can't think of a movie that has made such a lasting impression.",4,Kiri kiri kiri kiriiiii,1241568000,"05 6, 2009",2009,3181,"['praise', 'expected', 'so', 'much', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'breakout', 'movie', 'More', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'horror', 'was', 'impressed', 'disturbed', 'same', 'time', 'Audition', 'Technically', 'creatively', 'beautiful', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'more', 'pleased', 'disappointed', 'one', 'movie.According', 'Miike', 'commentary', 'heart', 'Audition', 'family', 'about', 'discovering', 'what', 'person', 'function', 'examining', 'relationships', 'define', 'home-life', 'Shigeharu', 'Aoyama', 'Ryo', 'Ishibashi', 'Japanese', 'Average', 'Joe', 'grieving', 'recently', 'deceased', 'wife', 'Aoyama', 'up', 'pain', 'loneliness', 'instead', 'devoting', 'son', 'Fast', 'forward', 'seven', 'years', 'stability', 'great', 'father-son', 'bond', 'son', 'father', 'remarry.With', 'casting', 'director', 'connection', 'Yasuhisa', 'Yoshikawa', 'Jun', 'Kunimura', 'guy', 'who', 'got', 'head', 'lopped', 'off', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'plan', 'devised', 'find', 'Aoyama', 'new', 'woman', 'fake', 'audition', 'seeing', 'pool', 'applicants', 'two', 'men', 'remark', 'societal', 'changes', 'dwindling', 'pool', 'traditionally', 'subservient', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'beautiful', 'classy', 'obedient', 'reviewing', 'several', 'candidates', 'however', 'Aoyama', 'eyes', 'Asami', 'Yamazaki', 'Eihi', 'Shiina', 'pretty', 'haunted', 'women', 'previous', 'aspirations', 'be', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'were', 'crushed', 'injury.Immediately', 'two', 'find', 'connection', 'dependency', 'loneliness', 'intimacy', 'increases', 'more', 'Asami', 'former', 'life', 'becomes', 'suspect', 'incredibly', 'sweet', 'demure', 'buildup', 'slowly', 'enough', 'uneasiness', 'develops', 'foreshadowing', 'hints', 'Aoyama', 'ignores', 'Too', 'bad', 'Aoyama.The', 'first', '60', 'minutes', 'slowly', 'persuade', 'viewers', 'forming', 'own', 'mental', 'endings', 'then', 'Miike', 'own', 'admission', 'hoped', 'twist', 'would', 'be', 'psychological', 'betrayal', 'leaving', 'viewers', 'shocked', 'going', 'details', 'gruesome', 'ending', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'plan', 'buying', 'home', 'alarm', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'never', 'go', 'acupuncturist', ""'ll"", 'always', 'sniff', 'drinks', 'taking', 'gulp', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'haunted', 'single', 'Japanese', 'word.Ishibashi', 'superb', 'depressed', 'Aoyama', 'Shiina', 'absolutely', 'blew', 'away', 'Per', 'portrayal', 'troubled', 'psychopath', 'bloodcurdling', 'ability', 'display', 'apathy', 'glee', 'towards', 'what', 'would', 'normally', 'elicit', 'nausea', 'was', 'brilliant.Both', 'strength', 'weakness', 'buildup', 'final', 'scene', 'difficult', 'two', 'ways', 'One', 'excruciatingly', 'long', 'probably', 'primary', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'polarizing', 'hour', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'characters', 'pure', 'ennui', 'causes', 'boredom', 'proxy', 'other', 'hand', 'buildup', 'difficult', 'viewer', 'relate', 'empathize', 'Aoyama', 'trust', 'rising', 'sanguinity', 'making', 'jaw-dropping', '180', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'not', 'just', 'gut-punch', 'gut-punch', 'father', 'completely', 'unpredictable', 'surreal', 'nature', 'nauseous', 'shock.Once', 'again', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'disappointed', 'beginning', 'agonizing', 'then', 'again', 'what', 'made', 'so', 'susceptible', 'surprise', 'Off-hand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'made', 'lasting', 'impression']",N/A

697244,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B0000640S9,Jeffrey Leach,"[202, 232]","In the battle between men and women, who will triumph? Who knows, but Japanese director Takashi Miike's film &quot;Audition&quot; shines a particularly brutal light on this eternal conflict. Set in Japan, the film takes on additional significance considering what we know about the role of women in that society. I am far not expert on Japanese social roles or mores, but I imagine the stereotypical picture of a Japanese woman as a subservient figure to men is more or less an accurate one. Certainly, gender roles have changed somewhat over the last fifty plus years as Japan rapidly industrialized and assumed a western style political system. One hopes that some progress in this area has taken place there, but I am not so sure after watching this film. Apparently, the idea of a docile, ever ready to serve her partner woman still exerts a strong influence in that country. Otherwise, &quot;Audition&quot; would make little sense to its target audience. Completely independent of its effect on Japanese audiences, the movie will send shivers down the spine of every American male.&quot;Audition&quot; starts like a Japanese adaptation of some saccharine American family television program. Aoyama, a man whose wife died some years before, desperately seeks female companionship. He works as a television producer, has done an excellent job raising his son, and enjoys bonding with this son on fishing trips. Aoyama, in other words, is a really nice guy. It's just that he is so lonely nowadays since his son is quickly growing up and has less and less time to spend with his father. Aoyama therefore soon faces the prospect of almost total solitude. Our hero opens his heart to his business partner one evening at the local bar, lamenting the changing face of Japanese society that has led to a decline of traditional women--meaning ladies who will stay home and serve their husbands--and a rise in the numbers of modern, cynical women. After commiserating with his buddy, the two come up with an excellent idea. Recognizing that they work in the film business, why not put out an ad for a female part in a new television program while secretly using the audition process as a means of securing the perfect mate for Aoyama? What a brilliant idea! A quick perusal of the resumes beforehand will help narrow down the final choices.The plan goes off without a hitch, and Aoyama does indeed discover a young woman who he thinks will be his ideal match. Blessed with an ethereal visage and the pretty name of Asami, this young woman seems like a magnificent catch. Aoyama likes the fact that the young woman has undergone a few personal tragedies in her life but emerged stronger because of them. He even seems to like her perpetual shyness, perhaps because it indicates Asami is a traditional woman who will know her place in Aoyama's household. Even after deciding on Asami, our hero hesitates to pursue the relationship. Should he be so forward? Wouldn't it seem indecorous to make such blatant overtures? As Aoyama debates what action he should take a few problems emerge that cast a pall over his choice. His partner encourages him to choose someone else, saying that her &quot;chemistry&quot; isn't right and that he has a bad feeling about this young girl. Another possible problem emerges when Aoyama discovers that Asami has no permanent address. Only a phone number links the two potential lovers, but the lonely Aoyama throws all caution to the wind and calls anyway. On the other end of the line sits Asami, who spends a lot of time sitting around a bare room waiting by the telephone. When the phone finally rings, a smile full of sinister implications stretches itself across Asami's mug. She obviously knows her charms worked on the older Aoyama and now she plans on running a show full of painful activities.No guy wants to think the sort of things that happen to Aoyama could really occur, but it can happen when you start treating people like objects instead of living, breathing beings. And Asami has been treated like an object by every male figure in her life. When it comes time to lash out at her oppressors, Aoyama is there to take the fall. The film becomes problematic when we learn that the main character is actually a nice guy. He loves his son, certainly wouldn't treat a woman badly, and is so lonely that it is tough to not empathize with the desperate measures he takes to find a woman. Miike lessens the likeability of Aoyama during the second half of the film, when we see he has some decidedly unsavory desires of his own, but I still couldn't help but feel sorry for the guy.Whether the extreme torture session between Aoyama and Asami actually takes place or is a dream really isn't all that crucial to the story line although it certainly achieves a fingernails on the blackboard effect for any male watching it. I think &quot;Audition&quot; is a film about how men and women constantly and consistently fail to connect on a personal level. When Aoyama authorizes the audition and reads through the resumes looking for the perfect woman, he assigns a host of assumptions to Asami based on what HE wants in a woman. Whether she will fulfill these expectations in person is secondary to what the man wants. Watch the movie, not just for the gore scenes, but also to view a social critique about gender roles and miscommunication.",5,Piano wire makes for a fun evening!,1073260800,"01 5,

I have several, they're strong and they're pulling me in different directionsBased on a novel by Ryu Murakami, director Takashi Miike's Audition is surprisingly ""deliberate"" and straightforward for much of its length. It's not a bad film at all, but most of it is in the realm of realist drama, even becoming something of a romance at one point. There are a few brutal images and scenarios, but they arrive primarily towards the end of the film, and they tend to be more conceptually disturbing than graphically violent.It's a good hour, at least, before anything very out of the ordinary happens in the film, and even when that time does arrive, the strange occurrences are extremely subtle at first. The pacing and tone of this first half of the film is more similar to Hideo Nakata's style as displayed in films like Ringu (1998) and Dark Water (Honogurai mizu no soko kara, 2002). This is only the third Mike film I've seen so far (I had difficulty tracking them down for purchase or rental before I joined Netflix), and the directorial style of Audition was surprising to me. That's because so far, every Miike film I've seen has a completely different style (the other two I've watched to date are Ichi the Killer (Koroshiya 1) and Happiness of the Katakuris (Katakuri-ke no kfuku), both from 2001).It would be easy to read this film as a misandrist/gynophobic horror. It might be taken as a more specifically culturally Japanese lament for the passing of a way of life, a la 'Tokyo Story'. You could note that the jumbled chronology or hallucinatory structure of the horror segment could indicate uncertainty. Did it really happen or are those his fears?You could do all of these things however, I think it's a cut and shunt job. I like both sections on their own, but stick 'em together and it feels like I can still see the tape holding the two sets of spliced film stock together. These themes deserve exploration and I'd love to see the missing two halves to the two parts we've seen. Together it's a dislocated joint in my brain, albeit a well-executed and compelling one.Imagine the sensation if the loss and hope in the first half could have made it through to be confronted by the psychosis and nightmares of the second. Instead they're misplaced somewhere in the confusion of a drugged glass of whisky and the director's desire to stupefy us into submission.Despite Asami's philosophy of getting at reality through pain, I don't think this film was painful enough, although I can't think of any part of it I didn't like. My reactions to the film may be contrary but they don't hurt enough.",3,Japanese always do horror films with exceptional flair.,1149206400,"06 2, 2006",2006,2662,"['difficult', 'know', 'what', 'reaction', 'film', 'have', 'several', ""'re"", 'strong', ""'re"", 'pulling', 'different', 'directionsBased', 'novel', 'Ryu', 'Murakami', 'director', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'Audition', 'surprisingly', 'deliberate', 'straightforward', 'much', 'length', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'most', 'realm', 'realist', 'drama', 'even', 'becoming', 'something', 'romance', 'one', 'point', 'are', 'few', 'brutal', 'images', 'scenarios', 'arrive', 'primarily', 'end', 'film', 'tend', 'be', 'more', 'conceptually', 'disturbing', 'graphically', 'good', 'hour', 'least', 'anything', 'very', 'ordinary', 'happens', 'film', 'even', 'when', 'time', 'arrive', 'strange', 'occurrences', 'are', 'extremely', 'subtle', 'first', 'pacing', 'tone', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'more', 'similar', 'Hideo', 'Nakata', 'style', 'displayed', 'films', 'Ringu', '1998', 'Dark', 'Water', 'Honogurai', 'soko', 'kara', '2002', 'only', 'third', 'Mike', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'had', 'difficulty', 'tracking', 'down', 'purchase', 'rental', 'joined', 'Netflix', 'directorial', 'style', 'Audition', 'was', 'surprising', 'because', 'so', 'far', 'Miike', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'completely', 'different', 'style', 'other', 'two', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'date', 'are', 'Ichi', 'Killer', 'Koroshiya', '1', 'Happiness', 'Katakuris', 'Katakuri-ke', 'kfuku', '2001', '.It', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'read', 'film', 'misandrist/gynophobic', 'horror', 'might', 'be', 'taken', 'more', 'specifically', 'culturally', 'Japanese', 'lament', 'passing', 'way', 'life', 'la', 'Story', 'could', 'note', 'jumbled', 'chronology', 'hallucinatory', 'structure', 'horror', 'segment', 'could', 'indicate', 'uncertainty', 'Did', 'really', 'happen', 'are', 'fears', 'could', 'do', 'things', 'however', 'think', 'cut', 'shunt', 'job', 'sections', 'own', 'stick', 'together', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'tape', 'holding', 'two', 'sets', 'spliced', 'film', 'stock', 'together', 'themes', 'deserve', 'exploration', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'missing', 'two', 'halves', 'two', 'parts', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dislocated', 'joint', 'brain', 'well-executed', 'compelling', 'one.Imagine', 'sensation', 'loss', 'hope', 'first', 'half', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'be', 'confronted', 'psychosis', 'nightmares', 'second', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'misplaced', 'somewhere', 'confusion', 'drugged', 'glass', 'whisky', 'director', 'desire', 'stupefy', 'submission.Despite', 'Asami', 'philosophy', 'getting', 'reality', 'pain', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'was', 'painful', 'enough', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'reactions', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'contrary', 'do', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'enough']",N/A

The cinematography is stunning and the acting is mostly top notch. But that isn't enough to overcome the almost joyous gore and torture the director subjects us to.One could argue that Audition is the logical progression expanding on David Lynch and Alfred Hitchcock. But I would argue that there needs to be a limit. While Audition is very well made and intelligent in it's own way, that same quality makes the gore even more unbearable.If you didn't know that Audition was a horror piece, you might have watched the first hour or so and enjoyed it. But by the end of Audition, I defy anyone to tell me they are glad they saw this film.Audition owes a lot to Italian horror master Dario Argento - particularly the film Trauma. Like Trauma, Audition has moments that will make you look away.American horror films have nothing that can compare to this film and other films by Argento. American horror films often give the viewer a chance to feel comfortable. But once Audition gets rolling, I seriously considered stopping the DVD several times.Audition is only suitable for certain audiences. Only extreme horror fans will enjoy it.

This is a film that challenges and excites so many different emotions in the viewer, it really should be seen ... a few times .... The plot follows a good-natured but lonely widower ( Ryo Isibashi ), and his search to remarry .... He has a good job ( he works in the film industry), and a very good relationship with his son ( and dog :), yet the seven years that have passed since the death of his wife have left him alone and empty ... At the suggestion of a coworker / friend, he stages an ""audition"" for a new film project ... What none of the applicants realize is that the ""new"" film project is actually an old rejected script that is being used as a vehicle for our lonely widower to meet a perspective wife ..... What makes AUDITION a little difficult to reveiw is the fact that, more than with most films, too much info and knowledge of the plot will take away from the fun ... But that's not to say that this film isn't worth seeing many times: it IS ... I have seen it 3 times now, and I look forward to seeing it a fourth ... ok, back to the film ...Eihi Shiina is applicant #28, an extremely beautiful and shy 24 year woman ... Did I mention beautiful ??? How about mysterious ??? ... Above all, she is intelligent, with a very impressive screen presence ... And much to the delight of both Ryo and Eili, they hit it off ... So much so that our long suffering widower's flame for life is rekindled in such a way, his verve for dating and happiness outshines even his teenage son's ... At his point in the film, the story and tone turn 180 degrees ... .... What follows is so harrowing and so disturbing, and with each passing scene we the viewer think back to the set-up audition and inital giddiness of our happy couple as almost an entirely different film ... But it WORKS ... Not only that, but the way the film spins out of control only adds to it's overall impact, and leaves us feeling THAT MUCH MORE horrified .... At this point I will mention the film debut of actress Eihi Shiina, who give a performance nothing short of stunning and unforgettable ... It is very rare that an individual can induce feelings of such horror, yet leave the viewer feeling saddness and pity to the point of tears ... I can't say enough about this brilliant young actress ... While I highly recommend this film, I must say that if child abuse, amputation, or sadism and torture might leave you feeling offended or queasy, do not see this film ... But if you prefer an experience to a ""movie"", I can't recommend AUDITION enough ... It might have taken 40 years, but I think we've found someone who can give Norman Bates a run for his money :) ...",5,A Must See ... and again ... and again,1023494400,"06 8, 2002",2002,2717,"['simply', 'reiterate', 'storyline', 'AUDITION', 'would', 'be', 'injustice', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'emotions', 'viewer', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'few', 'times', 'plot', 'good-natured', 'lonely', 'widower', 'Ryo', 'Isibashi', 'search', 'remarry', 'good', 'job', 'film', 'industry', 'very', 'good', 'relationship', 'son', 'dog', 'yet', 'seven', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'death', 'wife', 'have', 'left', 'alone', 'empty', 'suggestion', 'coworker', '/', 'friend', 'audition', 'new', 'film', 'project', 'What', 'none', 'applicants', 'realize', 'new', 'film', 'project', 'actually', 'old', 'rejected', 'script', 'being', 'used', 'vehicle', 'lonely', 'widower', 'meet', 'perspective', 'wife', 'What', 'AUDITION', 'little', 'difficult', 'reveiw', 'fact', 'more', 'most', 'films', 'too', 'much', 'info', 'knowledge', 'plot', 'will', 'take', 'away', 'fun', 'not', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'worth', 'seeing', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', '3', 'times', 'now', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'fourth', 'ok', 'back', 'film', 'Eihi', 'Shiina', 'applicant', '28', 'extremely', 'beautiful', 'shy', '24', 'year', 'woman', 'Did', 'mention', 'beautiful', 'How', 'about', 'mysterious', 'intelligent', 'very', 'impressive', 'screen', 'presence', 'much', 'delight', 'Ryo', 'Eili', 'hit', 'off', 'So', 'much', 'long', 'suffering', 'widower', 'flame', 'life', 'rekindled', 'such', 'way', 'verve', 'dating', 'happiness', 'outshines', 'even', 'teenage', 'son', 'point', 'film', 'story', 'tone', 'turn', '180', 'degrees', 'What', 'so', 'harrowing', 'so', 'disturbing', 'passing', 'scene', 'viewer', 'think', 'back', 'set-up', 'audition', 'inital', 'giddiness', 'happy', 'couple', 'almost', 'entirely', 'different', 'film', 'WORKS', 'Not', 'only', 'way', 'film', 'control', 'only', 'overall', 'impact', 'feeling', 'MUCH', 'MORE', 'horrified', 'point', 'will', 'mention', 'film', 'debut', 'actress', 'Eihi', 'Shiina', 'who', 'give', 'performance', 'nothing', 'short', 'stunning', 'unforgettable', 'very', 'rare', 'individual', 'can', 'induce', 'feelings', 'such', 'horror', 'yet', 'leave', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'saddness', 'pity', 'point', 'tears', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'brilliant', 'young', 'actress', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'must', 'say', 'child', 'abuse', 'amputation', 'sadism', 'torture', 'might', 'leave', 'feeling', 'offended', 'queasy', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'film', 'prefer', 'experience', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'AUDITION', 'enough', 'might', 'have', 'taken', '40', 'years', 'think', ""'ve"", 'found', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'give', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'run', 'money']",N/A

You get your movie producer friend to set up a fake movie so you can screen the young women auditioning for the lead role as prospective wives.

Demure little Asami spends her free time at home, sitting hunched-over and drooling while waiting for the phone to ring... with a large, bulging sack in the background.The film does explore very well the fears of men in Japan today while at the same time looking hard at and twisting the role of the &quot;obedient&quot; and proper traditional Japanese woman that Aoyama so desired.  Looked at from a cross-cultural perspective, the film makes much more sense--which only heightens the horror and disturbing nature of its message.I would wonder (or perhaps worry) about those who claim to truly love this film, but at the same time those who enjoy psycho thrillers or like to be disturbed will find this movie worth a watch.

I can't really compare it to any other film save the American ""Saw"" franchise which are the only ones that come close.  The movie starts out very slowly, building the viewers sympathy for the middle-aged man who has lost his wife and has become smitten with a mysterious 24 year old young woman.  There are foreshadowings early on that something is wrong, but nothing prepares you for the truth.  This film is a cautionary tale to all middle-aged men seeking that young trophy wife.  Be very careful what you wish for.I own this movie and have watched it several times and I still get VERY uneasy during some of the scenes.  When the lovely girl quietly purrs, ""Stick in!,"" it makes my skin crawl.  Note to prospective viewers:  the young woman is NOT referencing sexual intercourse when she speaks.If the sight of a young woman vomitting into a dog dish and feeding it to a grossly disfigured starving man she keeps tied up in a burlap bag doesn't appeal to you, then you might not want to eat before you watch this movie.  That is only one of the disgusting scenes in this tale about a lonely man in search of love and a young woman who was abused from her earliest memories by men who used her to satisfy their perverted sadio-masochistic and sexual desires.  The protagonist in the story is cautioned repeatedly by his best friend and even his dead wife who, in dreams, warns him, ""No, not her.  NOT HER.""  Still, he is so bewitched by his newfound love that he ignores the cautionary pleadings and embarks on a brief affair that ends in tragedy.  To the very end, he clings to his fantasy of his young woman as a gentle, loving, creature who wants only to love and be loved by him.If there is a theme to this movie, it might be to convey that to some extent, we are all actors; hence the name for the movie, ""audition.""

I had an idea of what was going to happen, and I thought I had accepted that. But the movie disarms you because it almost comes off as a romantic comedy, if only initially. I suppose it could still have been a decent movie, if that was where it was meant to go. But the script, and its writer, had a very different idea of what Audition was to be. I will not bother with plot description, or ruin this movie for you.

697261,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B0000640S9,K. Driscoll,"[8, 10]","Takashi Miike's Audition is a disturbing and at times confusing film. That being said, try to judge it for yourself while watching it, as the film takes you on an interesting and deceptive ride that plays on our definitions of film genres and cliche devices. In this respect Miike is not unlike Tarantino.  He is a director who thinks outside of the box and seemed to recognize the potential in expressing himself with this story...and used this wisely to scare the hell out of me.The story is about a widower who decides to finally begin a search for a new wife at the suggestion of both his son and his movie producer friend. But how will he find his new bride? Well, this man's friend is of course a filmmaker and he decides to hold an audition for this widower, so he can look for an attractive girl with a history in some kind of artistic discipline (i.e. dancing, piano, ballet etc.). Our protagonist possesses a handful of applications and must choose 30 girls to audition for a part in this faux movie. His friend agrees that he must find a girl who is happy to be his wife, and happy women are never good enough actors, so whoever he chooses will convincingly not be acceptable for this fake movie role to being with. However, contrary to his friend's advice our protagonist chooses a girl named Asami, who is profoundly unhappy. She used to be a ballerina but broke her hip and feels that having to quit something she loves can be paralleled to accepted death itself. Asami is not happy but she is an attractive 24 year old girl who has intrigued our hero and he more or less chose her before the audition happens anyway. The film takes a turn as we begin to see some hints as to what kind of person Asami is and all her mysteries are gradually revealed. Trust me when I say there is plenty about Asami to reveal.Miike gives us a film that comes off as a Romantic Comedy in the first 80 minutes and then slowly transforms into a thriller/mystery kind of film, and then smacks us over the head with it's intense climax and conclusion that is shock, horror, gore and utter madness. Audition could've easily become a one-trick-pony in it's goal to play with our understandings of genres and what to expect, but it actually goes far beyond that and rarely gets credit for doing so. This is a very sharp film on many levels and in many ways. It is smart and surprising.  I highly recommend this film to anyone willing and able to deal with it's violent content. I also see this as a gateway and introduction to Miike's films and other films like his. You shouldn't regret discovering this filmmaker.I have heard people say this is exploitative but that is likely a judgement on Miike overall, as Audition is one of his few films that really isn't exploitative at all. In fact, in terms of `gore' films Audition is not even close to Ichi the Killer but it should be taken with a warning as it is still very violent and realistic. I don't think this film deserves beyond an R-rating when we take into account the violence portrayed in ""The Passion of the Christ"". The limits have been pushed enough to allow films like Audition wider release in the United States without forcing either an NC-17 or no rating at all. There is almost no nudity in Audition but the violence and torture is creepy and well beyond acceptable for children to view.",5,A Modern Horror Masterpiece,1178755200,"05 10, 2007",2007,3344,"['Takashi', 'Miike', 'Audition', 'disturbing', 'times', 'confusing', 'film', 'being', 'said', 'try', 'judge', 'watching', 'film', 'interesting', 'deceptive', 'ride', 'definitions', 'film', 'genres', 'cliche', 'devices', 'respect', 'Miike', 'not', 'Tarantino', 'director', 'who', 'box', 'seemed', 'recognize', 'potential', 'expressing', 'story', 'used', 'wisely', 'scare', 'hell', 'me.The', 'story', 'widower', 'who', 'finally', 'begin', 'search', 'new', 'wife', 'suggestion', 'son', 'movie', 'producer', 'friend', 'how', 'will', 'find', 'new', 'bride', 'Well', 'man', 'friend', 'course', 'filmmaker', 'hold', 'audition', 'widower', 'can', 'look', 'attractive', 'girl', 'history', 'kind', 'artistic', 'discipline', 'i.e', 'dancing', 'piano', 'ballet', 'etc.', 'protagonist', 'handful', 'applications', 'must', 'choose', '30', 'girls', 'audition', 'part', 'faux', 'movie', 'friend', 'must', 'find', 'girl', 'who', 'happy', 'be', 'wife', 'happy', 'women', 'are', 'never', 'good', 'enough', 'actors', 'so', 'will', 'convincingly', 'not', 'be', 'acceptable', 'fake', 'movie', 'role', 'being', 'However', 'contrary', 'friend', 'advice', 'protagonist', 'girl', 'named', 'Asami', 'who', 'profoundly', 'unhappy', 'used', 'be', 'ballerina', 'broke', 'hip', 'feels', 'having', 'quit', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'paralleled', 'accepted', 'death', 'Asami', 'not', 'happy', 'attractive', '24', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'intrigued', 'hero', 'more', 'less', 'chose', 'audition', 'anyway', 'film', 'turn', 'begin', 'see', 'hints', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'Asami', 'mysteries', 'are', 'gradually', 'revealed', 'Trust', 'when', 'say', 'plenty', 'Asami', 'reveal.Miike', 'film', 'off', 'Romantic', 'Comedy', 'first', '80', 'minutes', 'then', 'slowly', 'thriller/mystery', 'kind', 'film', 'then', 'smacks', 'head', 'intense', 'climax', 'conclusion', 'shock', 'horror', 'gore', 'utter', 'madness', 'Audition', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'become', 'one-trick-pony', 'goal', 'play', 'understandings', 'genres', 'what', 'expect', 'actually', 'far', 'rarely', 'credit', 'doing', 'so', 'very', 'sharp', 'film', 'many', 'levels', 'many', 'ways', 'smart', 'surprising', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'willing', 'able', 'deal', 'violent', 'content', 'also', 'see', 'gateway', 'introduction', 'Miike', 'films', 'other', 'films', 'should', ""n't"", 'regret', 'discovering', 'filmmaker.I', 'have', 'heard', 'people', 'say', 'exploitative', 'likely', 'judgement', 'Miike', 'overall', 'Audition', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'really', ""n't"", 'exploitative', 'fact', 'terms', 'gore', 'films', 'Audition', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'Ichi', 'Killer', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'warning', 'still', 'very', 'violent', 'realistic', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'R-rating', 'when', 'take', 'account', 'violence', 'portrayed', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'limits', 'have', 'been', 'pushed', 'enough', 'allow', 'films', 'Audition', 'wider', 'release', 'United', 'States', 'forcing', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'almost', 'nudity', 'Audition', 'violence', 'torture', 'creepy', 'well', 'acceptable', 'children', 'view']",N/A

There's not that much violence but this girl still freaks you out with her insane secrets. The beginning is a little long but it's put to good when you see how it all comes together at the end. I started watching Audition expecting a very scary movie meaning excessive gore and things that really aren't needed but instead I got a thought provoking film and that's how it gets in your head.Asami seems like this cute young and talented girl with the usual ok but a little troubled past. It's crazy because Asami is cute but like Ryo's friend in the movie said right off you can tell something is wrong with her, you don't know how but you can just tell.

His search for romance is urged on by his son, who notes that his father appears lonely and downhearted.Hence the introduction of the father's film producer friend.  The two characters stage a film with dozens of eligible young women ostensibly auditioning for the lead role.  Meanwhile, of course, the father has ulterior motives in meeting and interviewing the ladies.When the father meets the leading lady, there is an instant chemistry between the two and they hit it off, going out to dinner, spending the weekend together, meeting her stepfather, etc.  She has a troubled past, including abuse and the shattering of her dreams as a ballerina, but has resolved many of her issues with her abusive stepfather and now apparently cares for him at her residence.Finally, she comes back to his house, where things get off on the wrong foot when the young lady introduces the father to her amateur acupuncture skills.  This is also the moment in the movie when the young lady meets the son and there is definitely some friction between the two.The end of the movie is unclear, but I am optimistic that these two lovebirds will make it work out in the end, despite their differences.

Aoyama becomes infatuated with a seemingly demure Japanese beauty, calls her, invites her out for dinner, and then all hell breakes loose. Maybe literally, maybe not - unlike most of Miike's billions of films, a lot of this is left to the viewer to decide.Miike directs from screenwriter Daisuke Tengan's script beautifully, letting the grotesque tension build to the point of bursting, subtly commenting on Japanese culture and with enough patented scenes of surreal freakishness to make the most jaded gore-hound run for cover (a friend of mine, seeing Audition in the theater, actually did, bolting out of his seat during the aforementioned needle scene).The special edition doesn't really include a lot of new stuff, but is completely uncut, with all the fun creepiness included.

But this one was.I won't go over the plot, it's been done here in many other reviews.What I liked about the movie was that it took time to build up the main characters. Some say it was slow, maybe so. But the story that lead up to what happened wasn't your typical slasher flick.These people have a character, they are fleshed out very well here. You are drawn to them as people first throughout the movie.When the blood does begin to spill, I felt more than just fear. I actually felt sorry. Mostly for the girl. It shows her life, through flashbacks, and how horrible it became until she finally snaps.About the flashbacks.... it got to be confusing because there were times it was hard to tell which was present day and which was in the past. And that was all I didn't like about the movie.The slashing that takes place is purposeful, also. I know that sounds a bit sick. But the female lead character has reasons for each dismemberment that she does! Although she is a sick person, she delivers each wound with thought that goes way back in her history. She is deliberate at the time she is chopping. I found that a little different from most other shasher flicks.This movie is indeed chilling because the characters are given such a full expression and personality.

But what happens when an audition leads to the most hellish moment of your life?The horror film genre is considered to be one of the greatest, bestselling markets of all time, but no one--and I mean no one--can even come close to the Asian horror film genre. The Ring--a bestselling movie in America--was based off of the Japanese movie Ringu. Bet you didn't know that, huh?Audition starts out simply enough. It shows Shigeharu Aoyama--our leading man-- grieving for his wife, while often thinking about what it would be like to remarry. When his son suggests to remarry, our main character decides to hold an audition. Now, this isn't a normal audition; it's fake, set-up, and is supposed to turn out a woman that Shigeharu will fall in love with.So, the audition turns out good. Shigeharu goes through the r&eacute;sum&eacute;s of all the women that came out for the audition, thirty in total. One woman's face seems to pop out at him. Asami Yamazaki is a pretty girl who liked to dance before she destroyed her hip in an accident, and she`s the woman that Shigeharu wants to get to know.What Shingeharu doesn't know is that Asami has a dark past, and that past continues to haunt her...To the core.Audition is a fine example of how foreign films can do well to an American audience. Modern-day America wants movies that they can be able to watch without having to read subtitles. (Americans read only one book a year, mind you; and some don't even read that. Why read subtitles on a foreign film when you can watch an American film?) Audition is stunning, horribly disturbing, and downright creepy.

The images in this movie not only sicken normal sensibilities, but more importantly act as receipes for a deranged mind. We have plenty of these already.

There is NO possible merit, or necessity, for including torture in movies.If a movie was based on factual events, or was intregal to the story, then torture only needs the briefest nod until our imagination takes over and fills in the rest. Just as effective.  A portion of society has grown up seeking cruelty and suffering in movies. It seems to be getting bigger. People that relish this kind of movie, and consider the 'normal' horror movies too boring and tame, are evidense of their own lack of sensibility. They haven't faintest idea of pain or misfortune because they lack the imagination.A new category should be created for movies like this, and this stuck in it.

However what makes it work is the study of alienation, childhood abuse, loneliness and the subtle insights into the working of a sick mind, what makes it so compelling is that the sick mind hides in the body of a gorgeous woman (Eihi Shiina who plays asami is a former model). Audition is a sick metaphysical tour de force, that leaves the viewer gasping for breath, while the beginning is a bit too slow-paced it is essential in shocking the viewer by lulling him into a sense of complacency leaving him totally unprepared for the sick mayhem that follows.A definite must-watch, but only if you have the stomach and heart for some very scathing cutting-edge cinema.",4,gruesome yet compelling,1108252800,"02 13, 2005",2005,3057,"['takashi', 'miike', 'punches', 'movie', 'clearly', 'not', 'squeamish', 'movie', 'devious', 'gory', 'credible', 'enough', 'keep', 'intelligent', 'viewer', 'wondering.The', 'PLOT', 'aayoma', 'lonely', 'widower', 'asami', 'pretty', 'single', 'young', 'woman', 'audition', 'set', 'up', 'purpose', 'helping', 'aayoma', 'find', 'suitable', 'girl', 'aayoma', 'fall', 'asami', 'hard', 'more', 'innocent', 'pretty-girl', 'looks', 'eye', 'dark', 'sinister', 'secret', 'demanding', 'love', 'results', 'tragic', 'incredulous', 'end.The', 'ANALYSIS', 'Audition', 'shock', 'value', 'there', 'more', 'movie', 'definitely', 'plot', 'based', 'enfant', 'terrible', 'japanese', 'literature', 'ryu', 'murakami', 'novel', 'linear', 'narrative', 'audience', 'impossible', 'vortex', 'horrifying', 'finale', 'where', 'narrative', 'spans', 'time', 'reality', 'back', 'forth', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'guessing', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'dream.PLOT', 'BREAKDOWN', 'SPOILERS', 'herein', 'Aayoma', 'asami', 'date', 'spend', 'weekend', 'together', 'resort', 'where', 'marriage', 'up', 'bed', 'having', 'nightmare', 'even', 'bed', 'thoughts', 'are', 'not', 'entirely', 'hers', 'asami', 'brittle', 'disturbed', 'mind', 'sign', 'doesnt', 'only', 'presumably', 'sometime', 'discussed', 'how', 'much', 'son', 'too', 'anyway', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'find', 'missing', 'out', 'past', 'involving', 'uncle', 'aunt', 'who', 'probably', 'mutilated', 'murdered', 'upto', 'viewer', 'decode', 'understand', 'record', 'company', 'agent', 'incurred', 'wrath', 'too', ""'suitably"", 'punished', 'asami', 'asami', 'sneaks', 'aayoma', 'house', 'drugs', 'drink', 'dog', 'drugged', 'state', 'even', 'aayoma', 'subconscious', 'beginning', 'unravel', 'information', 'mixing', 'up', 'own', 'personal', 'inner', 'demons', 'realisation', 'asami', 'figuring', 'out', 'asami', 'enters', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'not', 'done', 'aayoma', 'yet', 'inflict', 'serious', 'torture', 'aayoma', 'including', 'amputating', 'feet', 'enter', 'aayoma', 'son', 'father', 'suffering', 'more', 'end', 'story.FINAL', 'VERDICT', 'Audition', 'audacious', 'movie', 'viewer', 'throwing', 'sadistic', 'images', 'thoughts', 'However', 'what', 'work', 'study', 'alienation', 'childhood', 'abuse', 'loneliness', 'subtle', 'insights', 'working', 'sick', 'mind', 'what', 'compelling', 'sick', 'mind', 'hides', 'body', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'Eihi', 'Shiina', 'who', 'asami', 'former', 'model', 'Audition', 'sick', 'metaphysical', 'tour', 'force', 'viewer', 'gasping', 'breath', 'beginning', 'bit', 'too', 'slow-paced', 'essential', 'shocking', 'viewer', 'lulling', 'sense', 'complacency', 'leaving', 'totally', 'unprepared', 'sick', 'mayhem', 'definite', 'must-watch', 'only', 'have', 'stomach', 'heart', 'very', 'scathing', 'cutting-edge', 'cinema']",N/A

I bought it on the basis of many positive reviews & having recently gotten into the Asian horror films such as 'Ringu' &  'Pulse' (Kairo) I was looking forward to another great Asian horror film.  But of course it's not a Horror film.  Well, not really.  There's nothing supernatural here.  Just the rather sad tale of a man who's wife having died seeks love in a rather sneaky & underhand way setting up fake Audition's for a non-existent movie ( hence the title).  He meets a demure & otherworldly young woman who captures his overly eager heart.  Unfortunately this girl comes with a whole lot of History & none of its good.  If you didn't know better the first half of the movie plays out almost like a romantic comedy in stark contrast to how it ends.  Don't expect fireworks here though.

I don't care what country it comes from as long as it's interesting and worth taking a look at.Audition has a nice touch to it. Something that most Japanese horror films have. They are simple and try to bring your mind in to play. They don't go for the big right away they usually try to lure you into them and keep you guessing.Audition is in much the same fashion. Starting out with what feels like a normal movie then turns into an unexpected horror. This film you pretty much feel for the main character and his plight to find himself a good wife because he is a good man and that's all he wants. Just a nice simple woman that he can love and she can love him back. Knowing the main characters good intentions are what makes this a horror in seeing how it turns out.For the first 1hour and 10 minutes or so the film is great but then it's like the writers left the room and some random guy walked in and started defecating over the masterpiece they were righting. This movie doesn't have a satisfying ending at all. Mainly because you'll find yourself watching the ye ol' is this real or not dream sequence. It last longer than it should and it completely ruins the film I felt. It destroys the story they were trying to tell. Instead of writing out the movie where the main character discovers these things for himself they shove it in your face with a dream sequence. There's some disgusting stuff in the dream sequence that will make you cringe but for the most part you don't know what's really happening. It goes from interesting to bizarre to you completely lost me.I like horror but the Alice and wonderland sequences are ""played out"". They are a cheap shot to throw in a story that you couldn't figure out how to write (I hope movie producers realize we see through this). The ending actually left me more confused than shocked...then it ends abruptly.***might be a spoiler here*** The only real shock is that female in the story was abused all her life and she finally did meet a man that cared for who she really was and she tried to torture him to death). I guess the joke was on her and him.Either way this movie was going to end up a disaster... what could be expected from a guy who wants to marry a woman after only 3 dates. Better to take his foot now than half his finances after a messy divorce later down the line.

Be advised, however, this ain't one of em.  Like almost every review I've ever read of this puppy, I'll tell you right now that the less you know about this film going in the better you'll be able to appreciate it.  Granted, the first hour is kind of pacey and will leave you wondering where exactly the film is going.  The second hour is where the weirdness begins.  Now a lot of people have refered to this film as Lynchean and I can see their point somewhat.  The film's latter half includes many hallucinatory sequences and leaves it more or less up to you to decide what is real and what is fantasy.  The line is blurred about as much as it can be, so the answers are not easily forthcoming.  This, naturally, puts &quot;Audition&quot; in the same league as &quot;Lost Highway&quot; or &quot;Mulholland Drive.&quot;  I think, however, that the film also stands out as a prime example of what I refer to as Polanskiesque.  These are stories which draw you in with innocuous, though well crafted, scenes and scenarios gradually luring you into a false sense of security (along with the main character) until the trap eventually springs and it is too late to run and there is nowhere to hide.  The plus side of this technique is that it allows for a great deal of identification with the main character, the one through whom we experience the film, and makes their struggles our struggles and allows us to more thoroughly share in their destiny.  The down side is that most films simply are not made this way anymore and, as such, many people have forgotten how to relax and enjoy them.  This is a very literate, deliberate, pacey film that is meant to be enjoyed sans interruptions.

697283,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B0000640S9,Matthew King,"[2, 3]","Auteur of more than 50 movies since 1991, Takashi Miike gained an international cult reputation in the year 2000 with the release of Audition.  This film is an examination of the roles of women in modern Japanese society that completely shatters the myth of the Japanese woman being submissive and gentle.Aoyama is a lonely man who lost his wife seven years ago.  At the urging of his son, Aoyama agrees that it might be time to start seeing other women.  His co-worker proposes a scheme: Set up a fake audition for an upcoming film (Aoyama is a media mogul) inviting several dozen women to try out for the part.  The Audition in question is really an opportunity for Aoyama to be able to select from the pool his ideal woman.  His choice is Asami, a former ballet dancer who seems to fit the profile of ""beautiful, classy and obedient"".One of the more recurring themes in Audition is loneliness and how it can drive some to the brink of madness and do very questionable things.  Although his co-worker's idea of this fake audition is sleazy and deceptive, Aoyama goes with it anyway.  His personality is anything but mean or sleazy but Aoyama just doesn't possess the requisite social skills with the opposite gender to be able to find a woman in the more traditional way.  His supreme sense of loneliness is what drives him to agree to the scheme.  Asami, the object of his affection, seems even lonelier.  She lives by herself in a tiny apartment and spends all of her time either curled up in bed or sitting motionless on the floor doing absolutely nothing.  Miike's portrayal of this is effectively chilling, a tragic situation of two lovers who, because of their social awkwardness can never completely know each other.Audition benefits greatly from the strength of the characters that Miike creates.  Asami is a beautiful woman with godly looks who redefines the term ""sweet"" for most of the film.  Once the movie ended however I could barely get myself to look at her image on the DVD box cover without feeling repulsed. That says lots about Miike's power to lull the viewer into a state of shock.  The first  of the film moves slowly and makes us feel for the characters until we get assaulted in the last half hour with image after image of unpleasant gruesomeness (especially for a male viewer).  In yet another example of the unpredictable and unconventional style of director Takashi Miike, the last half hour of the film turns into an exercise of surrealist cinema where things are never what they seem and what is a dream and is not a dream is unclear.  Not many directors would be this good at playing it straight up for so much of the feature's length and then effectively turning it into a nifty David Lynch style head trip towards the end.  A true masterpiece of disturbing cinema by a director that we're used to being disturbed by.",5,Why reference checking is important,1076025600,"02 6, 2004",2004,2852,"['Auteur', 'more', '50', 'movies', '1991', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'gained', 'international', 'cult', 'reputation', 'year', '2000', 'release', 'Audition', 'film', 'examination', 'roles', 'women', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'society', 'completely', 'myth', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'being', 'submissive', 'gentle.Aoyama', 'lonely', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'wife', 'seven', 'years', 'ago', 'urging', 'son', 'Aoyama', 'might', 'be', 'time', 'start', 'seeing', 'other', 'women', 'co-worker', 'scheme', 'Set', 'up', 'fake', 'audition', 'upcoming', 'film', 'Aoyama', 'media', 'mogul', 'inviting', 'several', 'dozen', 'women', 'try', 'out', 'part', 'Audition', 'question', 'really', 'opportunity', 'Aoyama', 'be', 'able', 'select', 'pool', 'ideal', 'woman', 'choice', 'Asami', 'former', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'who', 'fit', 'profile', 'beautiful', 'classy', 'obedient', '.One', 'more', 'recurring', 'themes', 'Audition', 'loneliness', 'how', 'can', 'drive', 'brink', 'madness', 'do', 'very', 'questionable', 'things', 'co-worker', 'idea', 'fake', 'audition', 'sleazy', 'deceptive', 'Aoyama', 'anyway', 'personality', 'anything', 'mean', 'sleazy', 'Aoyama', 'just', ""n't"", 'possess', 'requisite', 'social', 'skills', 'opposite', 'gender', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'woman', 'more', 'traditional', 'way', 'supreme', 'sense', 'loneliness', 'what', 'agree', 'scheme', 'Asami', 'object', 'affection', 'even', 'lonelier', 'tiny', 'apartment', 'time', 'curled', 'up', 'bed', 'sitting', 'motionless', 'floor', 'doing', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'Miike', 'portrayal', 'effectively', 'chilling', 'tragic', 'situation', 'two', 'lovers', 'who', 'social', 'awkwardness', 'can', 'never', 'completely', 'know', 'other.Audition', 'benefits', 'greatly', 'strength', 'characters', 'Miike', 'Asami', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'godly', 'looks', 'who', 'redefines', 'term', 'sweet', 'most', 'film', 'movie', 'ended', 'however', 'could', 'barely', 'get', 'look', 'image', 'DVD', 'box', 'cover', 'feeling', 'repulsed', 'lots', 'Miike', 'power', 'lull', 'viewer', 'state', 'shock', 'first', 'film', 'slowly', 'feel', 'characters', 'get', 'assaulted', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'image', 'image', 'unpleasant', 'gruesomeness', 'especially', 'male', 'viewer', 'yet', 'example', 'unpredictable', 'unconventional', 'style', 'director', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'film', 'exercise', 'surrealist', 'cinema', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'never', 'what', 'seem', 'what', 'dream', 'not', 'dream', 'unclear', 'Not', 'many', 'directors', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'playing', 'straight', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'feature', 'length', 'then', 'effectively', 'turning', 'nifty', 'David', 'Lynch', 'style', 'head', 'trip', 'end', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'disturbing', 'cinema', 'director', ""'re"", 'used', 'being', 'disturbed']",N/A

He wants to be in a loving relationship once again. Thanks to his job as a movie/television producer and a crazy kooky plan from his friend, he decides to hold a fake audition for a show. The casting call that the women will be on for the show is actually more like window shopping for Shigeharu to find a new girl. While looking through resumes and portfolios of the women that will `trying out for the part', he comes across a pretty girl by the name of Asami Yamazaki who he intends to keep an eye for. During the casting call, most of the women just don't cut it for Shigeharu, until Asami sits down in the lone chair across from the two producers. Shigeharu is immediately attracted to her and decides to save her phone number to ring her up later. When he finally does call, he asks her out to dinner and they begin to hit it off. He tells her he'll call her again, but he doesn't right away because he doesn't want to seem desperate. And while he waits, so does Asami, literally. Asami sits uncomfortably looking, head hung low with her long black hair draped over her face, waiting for her rotary black phone to ring. The black phone that is sitting next to the brown potato sack. When the phone rings for the second date, and the smile that eerily forms on Asami's face, we then begin to find out more about Asami's past. She has been abused by every man that she's been in contact with and all she wants now is to be loved by 100% of someone's heart and nothing less.Audition is definitely one of those movies where at the end you will be saying ""What the heck did I just watch?"" And I say that in a good way. The first time I saw this, I was completely blown away by the ending. I did not see it coming at all. Well, not to the extent of what happened at least. But it left me confused because it seemed like it took too much of a dramatic turn of events. The second time having seen it, I think it was a lot better than I remembered. Though it still left me a little confused. Sure I get she was abused by all the men that should have loved her and treated her like a princess, but I honestly just didn't care for the ending that we saw (even though it was pretty awesome when it comes to being screwed up..hehe). I could understand why some of it would happen, but not the extreme situation of what we saw.  Maybe it was so extreme though because no matter how much anyone loves Asami, she'll never trust that love because of how screwed up she is now thanks to her childhood. And that's how Miike wanted to prove it to you. I really don't know.While I do like the movie, I would recommend this to only fans of this type of genre. It is a thought provoking movie, but it can be a tad to slow for some. When the end hits you in the face like bean bag from a shotgun, you're going to be doing one of two things. Saying ""That was awesome"" or ""That was dumb"". I'm only giving this a 3 stars (even though it's more like a 3.5) instead of a 4, because no matter how much I like the first 3/4ths' of the movie, the weird ending just kind of throws it off for me. Not the extreme part of the ending, but the little weird montage scenes.P.S. - I almost puked when she was feeding someone in the end...lol. =)",3,Dating sure can be a scary thing.

697291,ADQQE8RSV6KFP,B0000640S9,"Mondo Vendo ""Mondo Vendo""","[4, 11]","I have reviewed a lot of Miike films and this one is guilty of my most common criticism.  Some great scenes in an otherwise boring movie.This one suffers from the same problem as Gozu.  Boring slow buildup to an extreme ending.As similar to something I heard in Brian DePalma's Carlito's Way featurette, my criticism is that the beginning is excruciatingly long and boring.  But the solution isn't to shorten it but to make it longer.When we are told about the girl's background, much, much more details are needed to get us interested in her dangerous and dark mindset.Also when the violence comes at the end, I also felt it should have been extended 2 or 3 times the length to really make it torturous instead of some quick extreme violent acts.  But that may just be me, I thought the ""I Spit on Your Grave"" rape scene was extremely silly and unrealistic just cutting away to a guy making silly faces.  Same here, I didn't feel much empathy in the guy's torture.  It just didn't seem torturous enough to me.It was some good violence at the end but it was too quick and isolated to be reason to rate the movie higher.There are other problems as well, the main character is drugged and falls down.

As stated by the director on the DVD introduction, Audition is really slow for the first hour on purpose. It gives you a false sense of security. The tension really builds in the last 45 minutes and there are a few scary moments. One actually happens quite early, where we see the girl waiting for a phone call and something on the floor suddenly moves. Has she been staring at the phone like that for days? I get shivers just thinking about it. The acting by both Ryo Ishibashi (very likeable) and Eihi Shiiina (angelic and creepy at the same time) are excellent. The characters they play are on two different ends of the spectrum, but without properly casting these lead roles, the movie wouldn't have any legs to stand on. After reading some reviews by both critics, Quentin Tarantino (claims this is one of his favorite films) and the casual movie fan before I decided to rent this, I expected to be covering my eyes in disgust, or simply turning off the TV to avoid the horror and watch it the next day. That wasn't the case. Sure there are some disturbing images, but most of the gore is off-screen, save for one gross bit towards the end. It's what you don't see that gets inside your head and does all the dirty work. If you liked the original Japanese versions of The Ring or The Grudge, be warned this is far more brutal than those, but if Oldboy was your sort of thing, Audition should be right up your alley.

697293,A2X68A4CORTII2,B0000640S9,Monkey Deathcar,"[3, 4]","The plot is simple enough: Widower, father and all-around nice guy Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi) decides to remarry. Film producer Yoshikawa (Jun Kunimura) offers to audition actresses for a film that may or may not ever be produced, to help his shy friend find a ""nice girl"" in a non-threatening setting. Aoyama is imediately struck by thoughtful, demure Asami (Eihi Shiina), an ex-ballerina with a mysterious past. They strike up a relationship that appears headed for marital bliss...If you're at all familiar with this film, I don't need to tell you that Aoyama made the WRONG decision, so I'll try to avoid spoilers (almost impossible in discussing this film) and get to the heart of what I loved about ""Audition"":First of all, the film is extremely well-shot without being intrusive or drawing too much attention to itself. One example is during Asami's audition; the camera begins from behind her shoulder while she's questioned by Yoshikawa, and slowly moves toward Aoyama's face. You can see the attraction just in his facial expressions and it's a subtle, clever way to develop his connection to this alluring (and ultimately dangerous) woman. Director Miike sprinkles these kind of visual flares throughout the film, culminating in nearly 20 minutes of hallucinatory, visual storytelling toward the end of the film. I walked into ""Audition"" with no knowledge of his older movies and almost no expectations, and I was really impressed by how confidently the movie is shot.The movie also starts with such a languid pace and really takes the time to develop its characters, especially Aoyama and his playful, teasing relationship with his son. Most characters in horror movies are purely cannon fodder. I really grew to like and care about Aoyama -- a simple, shy and loving widower -- and it makes the carnage at the end of the movie that much harder to take.Finally, the story seems ripped right from the nightmare psyche of the Japanese male mind. Even a casual fan of anime or Japanese films knows that the culture tends to be very mysoganistic. Miike takes the stereotype of the demure, obedient asian girl and uses it as a bludgeon (or an acupuncture needle or fles-and-bone cutting wire, in this case) against the viewer. The message seems to be that even a basically nice guy like Aoyama is complicit in the kind of sexist culture that would great the monster who punishes him at the end of the film. Horror movies should be entertaining first and foremost, but if they also have an element of deep-seeded fear and something to say about societal ills that's a great asset. ""Audition"" succeeds on all counts.I probably don't need to warn you that some scenes at the end of this movie are EXTREMELY graphic and disturbing... proceed with caution! Gorehounds and fans of other Japanese or Italian horror films may not be shocked, but even as a fan of video nasties I found a couple parts of ""Audition"" to be pretty hard to watch. Unless you're even more jaded than I am, this movie will stay with you for awhile.My only qualm with the film (and the reason why I gave it four stars instead of five) is that Miike overplays his hand a little with the slow pacing in the beginning. I liked that he took the time to develop these characters, but it's a good 45 minutes into the movie before we even get a glimmer of the horrors ahead, and about an hour before things really get rolling. Viewers will be rewarded for their patience, but that ""Audition"" might get boring for fans of faster paced horror and isn't the kind of film you'll want to watch over and over again.Still, these are pretty minor quibbles. Great story, strong characters, excellent direction, and some very haunting and disturbing imagery make ""Audition"" one of the best horror films I've seen in years; highly recommended.",4,A Japanese male-psyche nightmare commit to film...,1101254400,"11 24, 2004",2004,3795,"['plot', 'simple', 'enough', 'Widower', 'father', 'all-around', 'nice', 'guy', 'Aoyama', 'Ryo', 'Ishibashi', 'remarry', 'Film', 'producer', 'Yoshikawa', 'Jun', 'Kunimura', 'audition', 'actresses', 'film', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'ever', 'be', 'produced', 'help', 'shy', 'friend', 'find', 'nice', 'girl', 'non-threatening', 'setting', 'Aoyama', 'imediately', 'struck', 'thoughtful', 'demure', 'Asami', 'Eihi', 'Shiina', 'ex-ballerina', 'mysterious', 'past', 'strike', 'up', 'relationship', 'headed', 'marital', 'bliss', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'tell', 'Aoyama', 'made', 'WRONG', 'decision', ""'ll"", 'try', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'almost', 'impossible', 'discussing', 'film', 'get', 'heart', 'what', 'loved', 'Audition', 'First', 'all', 'film', 'extremely', 'well-shot', 'being', 'intrusive', 'drawing', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'One', 'example', 'Asami', 'audition', 'camera', 'shoulder', 'questioned', 'Yoshikawa', 'slowly', 'moves', 'Aoyama', 'face', 'can', 'see', 'attraction', 'just', 'facial', 'expressions', 'subtle', 'clever', 'way', 'develop', 'connection', 'alluring', 'ultimately', 'dangerous', 'woman', 'Director', 'Miike', 'kind', 'visual', 'flares', 'film', 'culminating', 'nearly', '20', 'minutes', 'hallucinatory', 'visual', 'storytelling', 'end', 'film', 'walked', 'Audition', 'knowledge', 'older', 'movies', 'almost', 'expectations', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'how', 'confidently', 'movie', 'shot.The', 'movie', 'also', 'languid', 'pace', 'really', 'time', 'develop', 'characters', 'especially', 'Aoyama', 'playful', 'teasing', 'relationship', 'son', 'Most', 'characters', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'purely', 'cannon', 'fodder', 'really', 'grew', 'like', 'care', 'Aoyama', 'simple', 'shy', 'loving', 'widower', 'carnage', 'end', 'movie', 'much', 'harder', 'take.Finally', 'story', 'ripped', 'right', 'nightmare', 'psyche', 'Japanese', 'male', 'mind', 'Even', 'casual', 'fan', 'anime', 'Japanese', 'films', 'culture', 'be', 'very', 'mysoganistic', 'Miike', 'stereotype', 'demure', 'obedient', 'asian', 'girl', 'bludgeon', 'acupuncture', 'needle', 'fles-and-bone', 'cutting', 'wire', 'case', 'viewer', 'message', 'be', 'even', 'basically', 'nice', 'guy', 'Aoyama', 'complicit', 'kind', 'sexist', 'culture', 'would', 'great', 'monster', 'who', 'end', 'film', 'Horror', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'entertaining', 'first', 'foremost', 'also', 'have', 'element', 'deep-seeded', 'fear', 'something', 'say', 'societal', 'ills', 'great', 'asset', 'Audition', 'counts.I', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'warn', 'scenes', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'EXTREMELY', 'graphic', 'disturbing', 'proceed', 'caution', 'Gorehounds', 'fans', 'other', 'Japanese', 'Italian', 'horror', 'films', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'shocked', 'even', 'fan', 'video', 'nasties', 'found', 'couple', 'parts', 'Audition', 'be', 'pretty', 'hard', 'watch', ""'re"", 'even', 'more', 'jaded', 'am', 'movie', 'will', 'stay', 'awhile.My', 'only', 'qualm', 'film', 'reason', 'why', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'Miike', 'hand', 'little', 'slow', 'pacing', 'beginning', 'liked', 'took', 'time', 'develop', 'characters', 'good', '45', 'minutes', 'movie', 'even', 'get', 'glimmer', 'horrors', 'ahead', 'hour', 'things', 'really', 'get', 'rolling', 'Viewers', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'patience', 'Audition', 'might', 'get', 'boring', 'fans', 'faster', 'paced', 'horror', ""n't"", 'kind', 'film', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'again.Still', 'are', 'pretty', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'Great', 'story', 'strong', 'characters', 'excellent', 'direction', 'very', 'haunting', 'disturbing', 'imagery', 'make', 'Audition', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

697300,A2ASL6DAC9UY02,B0000640S9,Nnie the Hideous New Girl,"[2, 3]","Here's a great idea for an April Fools day joke of the century!  Get this movie.  Transfer it to an unmarked VHS tape.  Hand it off to a friend (Preferably one with a fairly strong stomach, just so they don't end up hating you) and tell them this is one of your favorite romantic dramas of all time.  No seriously, someone try this.  I want reactions.Anyways, now that I have that out of my system:  Unfortunately, I kinda knew what to expect when going into 'Audition,' but WOW, it is still a stroke of genius in its execution.  Don't let anyone tell you this movie is worthless because 3/4 of the story is 'boring.'  No, it's not /boring,/ it is an elaborate setup geared towards those watching the movie with /no prior knowledge of it./  (Which, unfortunately now, loses its punch at the expense of becoming a staple Japanese horror classic)  Furthermore, it's an engaging story with a fairly likable and sympathetic and middle-aged male lead, something you don't see all the time in horror movies which are usually riddled with angst-ridden teenagers and prom queens.  Right.If you're a shock/gorefest horror fan looking for instant gratification, this film probably isn't up your ally... but I would still recommend it for its unforgettable payoff.  Miike Takashi spends over an hour setting the audience up slowly, slowly, easing them into a sense of discomfort as the true nature of the story rears its ugly head and suddenly unleashes itself full force.  The acting is also amazing.  As I stated, the main lead is a hapless middle-aged man, Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi), living as a widowed father.  He has good intentions, but really wants to discover love again and as quickly as possible.  In his haste, he and his friend in film producing business devise a scheme to 'audition' a large group of attractive females; one for the lead heroine role in a movie, and one to take the role of his wife.Cue the subtle, soft-spoken, polite, and submissive Asami (Eihi Shiina).  She is everything he thinks he is looking for in a wife, and possibly more... but as they start seeing each other exclusively, she becomes seemingly as drawn to him as he is to her, possibly even more so.  Aoyama, however, soon discovers that there is little he or anyone else knows about Asami... and when she disappears, leaving him stranded alone in a hotel bedroom, he goes on a frantic search to find her and uncover her secrets, which leads to a fast and furious downward spiral into insanity, where the line between reality and dark fantasy blur.'Audition' won't feel like a horror movie until you really sink your teeth into it.

While that seems almost incomprehensible to me, I still credit them with the ability to get pleasure out of something from which I felt completely disconnected. And much like ""Mulholland Drive"", the film has inspired a lot of message board communication based on the inability of its fans to agree on (or to even understand) what director Takashi Miike was trying to communicate. Or for that matter what is supposed to be reality and what is supposed to be dream/hallucination. To experienced viewers of Japanese cinema I acknowledge that my finding the story predictable and simplistic is most likely due my inexperience with Japanese films (although I love ""Dansu Wo Shimasho Ka"" aka ""Shall We Dansu?""). But my point is that other inexperienced Japanese cinema viewers will probably have similar reactions.Accordingly, while I would not take the responsibility to recommend ""Audition"", I don't discount the possibility that some viewers may enjoy it. Technically and creatively it is a well made. Although the production design was an afterthought (antiseptic) and every scene is depressing and ugly; the lighting, editing and directing/acting are all excellent.It is not terrifying, it is not even scary although it has some gross scenes. It would be scarier if you were unaware of its genre and of the film's reputation, the less detail you know about plot, the better. This film can only offer suspense and shock when you don't yet know what to expect. Unfortunately, anyone reading these comments or the DVD case has partially blown it-so reading the next paragraphs if you intend to view the film is a bad idea.""Audition"" feels realistic, in part because of the deliberate slow pacing throughout the first 2/3's of the film. Unfortunately that makes it soap opera boring and I began identifying with the succession of passengers in ""Airplane"" who commit suicide rather than continue to listen to Robert Hays' life story. I was able to stay focused by counting the many spelling errors in the subtitles, which were especially amusing on the occasions when they changed the entire meaning of a sentence to something absurd.There is much more mild melodrama than horror or suspense, like reading a textbook on abnormal psychology while listening as a BBC historical drama plays on your television set. First you get thirty minutes that sets up Aoyama's family situation and loneliness. Then thirty minutes to introduce Asami and the start of their relationship. Then forty minutes unearthing Asami's family situation and loneliness. Finally Asami begins to take her revenge on Aoyama but is dispatched by his son with remarkable ease, so easy that you actually wish for a Jason-like reanimation.The ""Uncut Special Edition"" is not a new cut, it is the previous DVD release with new special features.

697306,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B0000640S9,OverTheMoon,"[2, 3]","At its very dark heart Audition is just another femme-fatal attraction movie. The bases for everything on display here is how women are used by men and the lengths that some will go to get revenge. The real strong point of this film is that the main male protagonist is just a really nice guy who messes it up with the wrong woman.The premise is simple. Lonely father seeks out his film making buddy to hold a fake Audition for a movie so that he can find a woman that he wants. The woman he chooses turns out to be a bit of a mystery and so he tries to track her past down only to reveal a lot of murder and mayhem along the way. The film then sort of becomes dreamy and we learn through some very confusing sequences that the protagonist has done a lot of bad things off-screen that we did not know about. The ending is torture in every sense of the word and has become legendary in Asian horror cinema.Many people will not like this movie because it is very slow moving and is often confusing even at the best of times. Towards the end of the film the director brings out a couple of flashback and dream sequences that actually show that our protagonist has been doing a lot of cheating and in many ways is getting what is coming to him, however at the same time what happens goes a way beyond justification and certainly shocks the viewer on all counts. Many viewers will have their eyes firmly shut until the screaming stops.The imagery and editing in this film are striking. The story is non-linear and this will put many people off but it is done in a David Lynch sort of way. The film must be watched more than once in order to understand the story but this can be a hard task to be put through twice because of its sluggishness at the start and merciless display of horror at the end.Although never one to tell the audience everything directly Takashi Miike's modern masterpiece still works as a structured film although crudely done but highly original all the same. This is an extremely graphic film that is not for the squeamish by any means but you will be hard pressed to find any femme fetal movie that can match it for horrors.Men of the world, learn the message well.

Apart from the original Russian ""Solaris,"" and the German mini-series ""Das Boot,"" I can count the number of films I've read the subtitles to on one hand, and they've mostly been by Kurosawa.I purchased this movie purely on the strength of the reviews I read of it here on Amazon, the first time I've done so. ""Audition"" seems to elicit extreme reactions from reviewers, like Kubrick's 2001, you'll either love it or hate it... and as you can see from the 5 Stars I gave, I'm in the former category. But just so you know, my taste in film runs from, A Man For All Seasons, to the original Halloween, via the aforementioned 2001, and the original Dirty Harry!I won't go into too much plot detail, others have done so, suffice to say it's not terribly original; boy meets girl, boy falls in love, boy loses girl, girl reappears, transformed from meek and mild child-woman, to messed-up psycho-slasher with an extensive collection of acupuncture needles!The first half of the film plays out as a gentle romantic comedy. Even with reading the subtitles, and missing the undoubtedly subtle Japanese cultural references, I was smiling and chuckling as our hero, Aoyama, met, under slightly dishonest circumstances to be sure - the ""auditions"" of the title - and then started to woo, the girl of his dreams, Asami.But all, of course, is not as it seems. Her background is hazy, to say the least, but still, he is smitten, and plunges headlong into the relationship, only to have her disappear without trace after they have made love for the first time.He sets out to track her down, and slowly but surely his world disintegrates into a living nightmare of disturbing revelations and strange, dreamlike, meetings. This all builds inexorably to the ""messed-up psycho-slasher"" finale, with its extended scenes of fairly graphic torture, which, to be honest, COULD have been much worse! The reasons for all the horror goes back to Asami's childhood, and is explained in a couple of, brief though explicit, scenes of sadomasochistic child abuse!This film is not for everyone by any means, but it is one, I feel, that will reward repeated viewing. The performances, cultural subtleties aside, are warm and naturalistic, the story is solid, but it's the direction/editing that drives the whole thing, relentlessly, to its Grand Guignol conclusion. Certain scenes are repeated/expanded upon, seen from different perspectives, then repeated again `til you're not quite sure what is ""real"" and what is imagined on the part of the protagonists.

I usually try to avoid making comparisons to other movies in my reviews, but talking about this film in context to Ichi the Killer will help me be more clear about what I'm trying to say.When I saw Ichi the Killer, I was stunned by how well everything added up into an insanely exciting climax that is honestly one of the best pieces of cinema I had seen in a while.  When I read the synopsis of this film, Audition, I was expecting that it would be even more intense because it would be a more personal accumulation into sadism and psychotics than the public gang-brawl exposition of Ichi the Killer.And I was disappointed.  Whereas this film does go in directions that seem incredible and amazing (and very, very uncomfortable), said directions don't really seem to have a purpose.  I mean, she's a sadist and the subject of an abusive life, but what are we supposed to do with it besides the little bit of what's there?  This film doesn't really end, it just kind of gets it over with and then dies down.  I was expecting a lot more from it.This isn't to say this film is completely terrible or even bad.  It's very finely crafted and for most of the lead-up is very exciting.  The knowledge of what's to come makes it terrifying, and I don't even want to think about what this movie would be like without knowing what's going to happen--possibly traumatizing.  Yet it eventually left me unsatisfied.Miike is an amazing director and an awesome visual artist.

697312,A1H6IVVF68QYC7,B0000640S9,prospero72,"[2, 3]","REVIEW: What appears to be a well-acted drama about a Japanese widower seeking a new wife: nose dives headfirst into a superb yet gruelling thriller on a par with ""PSYCHO"", ""REPULSION"", and ""FATAL ATTRACTION"". Famed director Miike is no stranger to subtlety, but the restraint he shows in the first half of the film (as he carefully builds up the seemingly normal chain of events surrounding his protagonist, T.V. producer Aoyama, and his ""auditioning"" a new wife in conjunction with his friend's latest project) pays off brilliantly by the film's end as we come to find out that Aoyama's ideal mate (a beautiful yet demur mystery woman named Asami - wonderfully played by actress Shiina) may not have been the best choice for a lifetime companion! The surreal quality of the final hour is deliberately hallucinatory as the revelations that confront the audience may just very well be the subconscious depiction of Aoyama's fear of re-marrying and the guilt he feels in ""betraying"" his love for his dead wife (the continual pleading of the Asami character to ""love only me"" could certainly be a reflection of Aoyama's own sense of loyalty and fidelity). It is interesting that all of the more ""nightmarish"" segments of the film occur after Aoyama is shown to be drifting off to sleep (and after making love to Asami for the first time). Add to that the sharp psychological portraits of these two people and how they mirror each other's emotional pain: and you have a Japanese version of Ingmar Bergman's classic ""PERSONA"" which dealt with a similar situation whereby two people act out their innermost turmoil against a surrealistic backdrop of film exposures. But apart from the final half hour: the most striking thing about ""AUDITION"" is the pall of loneliness that hangs over the film (one character even makes the comment that ""all of Japan is lonely""). And so loneliness is the main theme of the story: whether it is depicted as Aoyoma sitting quietly alone at the dinner table, or Asami staring at the telephone in a bare room (well, ALMOST bare: except for the oversized burlap bag which she keeps close by...). The whole film reeks of terrible pain, tragedy, and grief. As usual with a Miike film: it is the sexual violence that is more disturbing by far (though here it is kept to a peripheral minimum) while the various horrific things that one character does will certainly make you hurl your lunch (if you've already seen the film: then no pun intended!). But again I wish to stress the emotional and psychological horror of the film which is the true core of its message, and which can also be read as a treatise against the undercurrent of male chauvinism strikingly prevelant not only in Japanese culture: but in every culture. The women who are abused, neglected, ignored, and treated with indifference or in a politely condescending tone are shown at the end of the story to be not only scarred in various ways, but also to be victims and human beings struggling against the damaging effects of such a male-dominated social structure. But aside from its philosophical and spritual implications: ""AUDITION"" will be forever known as the flick that garnered a record number of walk outs when it was screened at the Rotterdam Film Festival. So be forewarned: you know that when a film director gives such advice (in the DVD special feature ""Director Introduction"") as ""If you feel sick, pause the movie. Watch the rest of it tomorrow."" that you are in for a heap of gut-wrenching trouble.

697319,A2WL02ENWFU9PM,B0000640S9,Rex Macaroe,"[3, 3]","I was first introduced to Audition by Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments in which it landed a not too modest # 11. Director John Landis (Animal House, An American Werewolf in London) confessed that he disliked it because it was TOO horrifying. Everyone else enthusiastically recounted the film's vomit-inducing closing as one of the most graphic and innovative torture sequences ever filmed.Based on this I was a little apprehensive that it might turn out like the shamefully exploitative horror films that have been polluting theaters lately (Cabin Fever, Saw, Chaos), that it would be a blood-fetish pornography hiding behind a poorly drawn social parable which makes the film even more obnoxious.With a different director (one in particular jumps to mind, but I'm not going to mention Eli Roth's name), this would've probably been the case, but Miike displays one characteristic which separates Audition from its less savory contemporaries: he looks on his characters, their infidelities and their cruelties, not with disdain and contempt, but with understanding, sympathy, and even compassion.The presence of sadomasochism in the first half is extremely subtle compared to the T&A; sequences that break Scream's horror movie survival rules. There is no prostitution or rape, only an unconventional and perhaps slightly dishonest way of meeting the right girl. Indeed when the tables finally do turn, the revenge hardly seems justified. And at the moment of greatest hopelessness, we see how, had the main character's shyness not inhibited his honesty, the whole situation might never had developed.Audition's insight will satisfy most thoughtful movie-goers, and its gore should satisfy the cult crowd. Yet there's something mysteriously dry here. Usually seeing a film like this (even a horrible one) phases me. I'll be trapped in deep thought about the film's social implications or mope a little after the extreme violence. A dark cloud will hang over my mood for a while, and the experience will be difficult to shake from my mind.

It's like 'Fatal Attraction' on steroids .......After the unexpected death of his wife, our hero, on the prodding of his teeage son decides to get out in the world and look for a new wife, but being involved in the movie world he decides why not just do an audition for a non existent film. The girl he is absolutely enfatuated with has a foggy background and his romance of her moves so swiftly that the sheer fact he can't verify a single detail of her life seems not to really matter to him at all .....Course I guess, being a man in 'lust' I guess I can understand that and the movie makes sense.OK .. not to spoil it .. but ...

697324,A29OBSB76YTD6K,B0000640S9,sandwich,"[2, 3]","I prefer films, whether they be horror or psychological thrillers (and this one is sort of both), where the suspect or villain isn't beyond human and just conveniently evil for the sake of an escalating level of suspense and to draw a close to the mystery.  They're more realistic in the sense that the 'bad guys' are depicted as individuals with their own thoughts, perceptions and personality, etc, and they respond to everything around them in their own way and have been affected by specific experiences and encounters from their past which have molded their overall perspective on the film scenario.  When you have a more profound understanding and can feel compassion for the misunderstood antagonist - it makes them all the more fearful because they're more human and they are simply acting upon their own instincts, motivation and desire.  Since you understand this and you may even relate and have a connection to the killer, in a way you want them to get away with what they're doing as though you were doing it yourself.This film really touched me because I felt incredibly connected to Asami and the issues of isolation and loneliness addressed in this film.  In fact, I felt sorry for her as much as I thought she was foolish for getting herself involved such a predicament in the first place.  The whole situation could've been avoided realistically, but then when you consider Asami's devastating past and her current grief-stricken, oppressive lifestyle it makes a lot more sense.  The torture scene then seems even almost romantic.Because of this film's complex storyline and themes, I think it stands out on its own as more of a thriller and tragic romance than a horror film.  I think it delivers a powerful message which is bound to touch most of us with pondering doubts and questions regarding our own identity, what we look for in relationships, and how we perceive culture and tradition.",5,An intelligent twist,1069804800,"11 26, 2003",2003,1911,"['prefer', 'films', 'be', 'horror', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'one', 'sort', 'where', 'suspect', 'villain', ""n't"", 'human', 'just', 'conveniently', 'evil', 'sake', 'escalating', 'level', 'suspense', 'draw', 'close', 'mystery', ""'re"", 'more', 'realistic', 'sense', ""'bad"", 'guys', 'are', 'depicted', 'individuals', 'own', 'thoughts', 'perceptions', 'personality', 'etc', 'respond', 'everything', 'around', 'own', 'way', 'have', 'been', 'affected', 'specific', 'experiences', 'encounters', 'past', 'have', 'molded', 'overall', 'perspective', 'film', 'scenario', 'When', 'have', 'more', 'profound', 'understanding', 'can', 'feel', 'compassion', 'misunderstood', 'antagonist', 'more', 'fearful', ""'re"", 'more', 'human', 'are', 'simply', 'acting', 'own', 'instincts', 'motivation', 'desire', 'understand', 'may', 'even', 'relate', 'have', 'connection', 'killer', 'way', 'want', 'get', 'away', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'were', 'doing', 'yourself.This', 'film', 'really', 'touched', 'felt', 'incredibly', 'connected', 'Asami', 'issues', 'isolation', 'loneliness', 'addressed', 'film', 'fact', 'felt', 'sorry', 'as', 'much', 'thought', 'was', 'foolish', 'getting', 'involved', 'predicament', 'first', 'place', 'whole', 'situation', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'avoided', 'realistically', 'then', 'when', 'consider', 'Asami', 'devastating', 'past', 'current', 'grief-stricken', 'oppressive', 'lifestyle', 'lot', 'more', 'sense', 'torture', 'scene', 'then', 'even', 'almost', 'romantic.Because', 'film', 'complex', 'storyline', 'themes', 'think', 'out', 'own', 'more', 'thriller', 'tragic', 'romance', 'horror', 'film', 'think', 'powerful', 'message', 'bound', 'touch', 'most', 'pondering', 'doubts', 'questions', 'regarding', 'own', 'identity', 'what', 'look', 'relationships', 'how', 'perceive', 'culture', 'tradition']",N/A

Asian cinema has a flare I don't find in American flicks. I was impressed with production, as well as directing, editing and superb acting. The storyline was expertly established from the beginning. The loneliness of the title character was unquestionable. So was that of the unexpected 'perfect lady.' Unlike many reviewers, I missed the horrifying 'horror.' This was a unique thriller and skillfully executed, even when dialogue was absent. But, to me, this was not a horror movie. The 'creepy' factor was missing, so I watched in expectation of something I never experienced. The 'perfect lady' was definitely demented and did horrible things, but didn't horrify me.

I seriously don't know exactly what level of damage we inflicted to the Japanese psyche with our ""visit"" to Hiroshima 50 years back, but methinks it has something to do with the likes of this movie; which (along with the rest of Miike's oeuvre) makes 99% of American horror entries past and present look like an episode of The Brady Bunch by comparison.The genius of this film lies in its pacing. Unlike most pedestrian, substandard ""slasher"" flicks which hit you with the splatter and severed bodies almost right up front, Audition takes its sweet time in milking the suspense for all it's worth. At first, this movie seems like a slightly quirky romantic comedy with a Japanese twist (main character and film producer Aoyama's wife dies of terminal illness, so at the behest of one of his friends he stages a fake film audition in order to find a prospective bride). He discovers the delightful, alluring, and stereotypically submissive beauty Asami (played to the cold steel hilt by Eihi Shiina), a woman who is not at all who she appears..I won't spoil the rest. Suffice to say, once things start coming unglued and Asami reveals her true sadistic nature, you will be left with images that dive like a red-hot fireplace poker straight into your psyche; a portrayal of cultural gender roles turned on their heads; and will probably have to sleep with the lights on for the next week and a half. You will never look at a doctor's needle or even the mere act of calling your pet cat the same way again. And I mean all that in the best possible way.

697332,A1KVBBRXQ2PWJ7,B0000640S9,Siklootd,"[0, 0]","""Audition"" is heavily praised by millions across the globe citing it as one of the greatest films to ever come out of Asia.  Critically acclaimed as a Japanese horror and thriller masterpiece, ""Audition"" is a gem within the vast mass of foreign films available to the American public.  Due to its everlasting praise at every turn, I was intrigued enough to check out the film for myself in order to analyze its value from my own, personal perspective as compared to what I have heard in regards to the film.  Described as being ""violent, obscene, grotesque, gory, creepy, and haunting"", does the film live up to all of its praise or does it deserve its own fair share of criticism?  The answer: a mixture of the two.  The film has its high points, but it is also full of negative points which heavily weigh it down from being as haunting as other foreign masterpieces within the horror genre.The film begins by showing a man in the hospital with his wife, who is sick and dying.  The woman dies and leaves her husband and son behind to fend for themselves.  Immediately the film takes the viewer to a later time, showing the son and father fishing together with the son discussing reasons why his father should begin dating women again.  Full of grief, the man (Shigeharu Aoyama) never remarried, but his son feels it's about time he tests the waters again and tries to find another companion for his lonely life.  Shigeharu Aoyama eventually agrees with his son, and with the help of his friend, the two men come up with a perfect plan for Shigeharu Aoyama to meet a nice woman who meets his qualifications: hold an audition.The audition is held in false light, telling young women that the two men are producing a new film and that they are in search of the lead actress for the film.  Hundreds of women show up for the audition, all showing their best reasons why they should be chosen, whether it's from their dancing skills, acting skills, or their willingness to strip off their clothes in front of the two men, all of the women are trying their best to get the part at all costs.  However, one woman truly catches Shigeharu Aoyama's eye, a young woman by the name of Asami Yamazaki.  Asami Yamazaki is very shy, a quiet girl who is very reserved in her actions when approaching the two men.  Immediately Aoyama is fascinated by her and asks her out the next day.Aoyama and Asami begin to bond, however, the closer he gets to Asami, the more his friend questions the woman's true intentions and motives.  It is slowly revealed that everything Asami has said is nothing but a lie, from here address, to her place of employment and even the name of her manager at a major record label.  The film continues to simply display the ever-growing attraction and obsession that Aoyama has for the woman, depicting the several dates the two go on, along with other intimate encounters between the two.For this reason, the film feels more like a drama, a romantic tale between two people.  The slow pacing lasts for almost the entire length of the movie, simply consisting of the two lovers interactions with one another, and almost nothing else occurring.  Not until the last 25 minutes or so does the film truly become intense with shocking scenes of violence, and grotesque mannerisms.  Through a series of flashbacks and other glimpses into Asami's past, the audience is greeted to scenes of body mutilation to a high degree.  The truth behind Asami and her former lover is revealed, along with her true past actions of murder and deception.  With Aoyama as her new target, Asami will stop at nothing to make sure the man will not leave her, even if that means slicing off his feet so he can no longer walk.The film takes too long to develop into a truly intense horror/thriller flick.  The majority of the movie is simply used to show a romantic connection between two people, with little to no other developments occurring whatsoever.  However, once the film takes a turn and decides to pick up, the film becomes one of the most disturbing foreign horror films available on the market.  It provides the audience with vile, stomach turning scenes and violence rarely shown in most Japanese movies.  The last 20 minutes of the movie do make up for the slow build up, but it still leaves the audience wishing that the film had taken the dramatic turn much earlier before the viewer loses their attention due to the lack of development within the movie up until the turning point.  ""Audition"" is an excellent addition to any collection, as long as the viewer knows what to expect: a film with a very slow pacing but a very dramatic, violent, grotesque ending sure to satisfy any horror fan.  If you're looking for a better paced foreign film, ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" is a truly haunting Korean film that keeps the audience disturbed with constant images of gore and provides a high quantity of thrills throughout its entirety.",4,Slow Build Up but Worth it in the End,1285545600,"09 27, 2010",2010,4923,"['Audition', 'heavily', 'praised', 'millions', 'globe', 'citing', 'one', 'greatest',

Slowly we begin to learn that the beautiful ballerina isn't all she seems to be and the mild mannered widower is in for a horrible surprise. I found Audition to be quite tragic. The main character is just a nice guy tring to get his life back together after the painful loss of his wife but instead he finds a piano wire wielding psycho. The end of Audition really disturbed me. It disturbed me so much I could almost say I didn't like it, but in essence that is the sign of a good suspense/horror film and very few movies disturbed me like Audition was able to.

697339,A35FMDBNQ2SI52,B0000640S9,"Squash 'N' Squeak ""The Silencing Machine""","[11, 26]","Audition is heralded as being one of the greatest horror films of the last decade. It's supposed to be creepy, eerie, shocking, horrifying, etc, etc, etc. It sounds like a winning formula, since a lot of horror films these days sacrifice these aesthetics for gore and an element to gross out the audience. I had high expectations for this movie and expected to be as enthralled as everyone else. Lo and behold, it is yet another ridiculously overrated movie.It has a nice concept. Shigeharu holds an ""audition"" to find s replacement for the wife he lost 7 years ago to an illness. The one he finds seems to be perfect at face value, but we soon learn that there's a little more to her than meets the eye. I will give this film one compliment - it certainly takes the time to develop its characters. The theme of loneliness driving people to do ridiculous things (whether it's wanting to marry someone you just met, or just wanting to torture theme) is actually very powerful. However, that's the only good that this movie generates. Its biggest flaw is its pacing. Audition drags on... and on... and on... and on. Hardly anything happens within the first 80 minutes of its 115-minute run time, aside from a moving sack, which almost everyone on the planet has heard of. This film mistakes its boring, droning atmosphere for a dark, brooding one. By the time the excitement begins, I was already left with the desire to shut it off because the previous footage was a sleeping pill. The two main characters have plenty of depth, but they overstay their welcome way before the movie is over, and I found it hard to care about them by the time the ""torture"" scenes began. It's 115 minutes that could have very easily been condensed to 80 or even 70 minutes. A lot of the film gets very redundant with the two of them going out to dinner on a multitude of times and them both staring lustfully at the phone for God knows how long.The movie really isn't even that disturbing. I'll admit, though, that the ""vomit scene"" certainly made me cringe and was legitimately creepy. It's a testament to the idea that horror films don't need gore to be effective or scary. But it's a drop of brilliance in a sea of monotony and mediocrity, and one I don't feel like swimming in again. The scenes of Asami torturing Shigeharu aren't disturbing at all, and actually feel drawn out (like the rest of the movie!). I was relieved when the movie was over, but also mourning over the knowledge that I will never get back those 115 minutes.Perhaps I'm slow and ignorant, as I'm sure many reviewers will pin on me, but I've seen a lot of movies over the years and this one doesn't come close to being a quality film. Had it been shorter and equipped with a bit more excitement, it probably would have turned out to be much more effective and compelling. Modern horror is thriving quite well, despite what many critics like to tell the world, but this film doesn't exemplify that. Martyrs, The Descent, Let the Right One In, A Tale of Two Sisters (actual quality Asian horror cinema) The Others, and even the Saw movies (which contain good plots and themes, despite them being the favorite whipping boys of critics for content that doesn't even exist in the series) are all far better and more compelling examples of good modern horror movies, and beat out Audition any day of the week.",1,An obscene lack of content.,1268092800,"03 9, 2010",2010,3359,"['Audition', 'heralded', 'being', 'one', 'greatest', 'horror', 'films', 'last', 'decade', 'supposed', 'be', 'creepy', 'eerie', 'shocking', 'horrifying', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'winning', 'formula', 'lot', 'horror', 'films', 'days', 'sacrifice', 'aesthetics', 'gore', 'element', 'gross', 'out', 'audience', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'movie', 'expected', 'be', 'as', 'enthralled', 'everyone', 'else', 'Lo', 'behold', 'yet', 'ridiculously', 'overrated', 'movie.It', 'nice', 'concept', 'Shigeharu', 'audition', 'find', 's', 'replacement', 'wife', 'lost', '7', 'years', 'ago', 'illness', 'one', 'be', 'perfect', 'face', 'value', 'soon', 'learn', 'little', 'more', 'eye', 'will', 'give', 'film', 'one', 'compliment', 'certainly', 'time', 'develop', 'characters', 'theme', 'loneliness', 'driving', 'people', 'do', 'ridiculous', 'things', 'wanting', 'marry', 'someone', 'just', 'met', 'just', 'wanting', 'torture', 'theme', 'actually', 'very', 'powerful', 'However', 'only', 'good', 'movie', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'pacing', 'Audition', 'Hardly', 'anything', 'first', '80', 'minutes', '115-minute', 'run', 'time', 'aside', 'moving', 'sack', 'almost', 'everyone', 'planet', 'heard', 'film', 'boring', 'droning', 'atmosphere', 'dark', 'brooding', 'one', 'time', 'excitement', 'was', 'already', 'left', 'desire', 'shut', 'off', 'previous', 'footage', 'was', 'sleeping', 'pill', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'plenty', 'depth', 'overstay', 'welcome', 'way', 'movie', 'found', 'hard', 'care', 'time', 'torture', 'scenes', 'began', '115', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'very', 'easily', 'been', 'condensed', '80', 'even', '70', 'minutes', 'lot', 'film', 'very', 'redundant', 'two', 'going', 'dinner', 'multitude', 'times', 'staring', 'lustfully', 'phone', 'God', 'how', 'long.The', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'even', 'disturbing', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'though', 'vomit', 'scene', 'certainly', 'made', 'cringe', 'was', 'legitimately', 'creepy', 'testament', 'idea', 'horror', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'gore', 'be', 'effective', 'scary', 'drop', 'brilliance', 'sea', 'monotony', 'mediocrity', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'swimming', 'again', 'scenes', 'Asami', 'torturing', 'Shigeharu', 'are', ""n't"", 'disturbing', 'actually', 'feel', 'drawn', 'out', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'relieved', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'also', 'mourning', 'knowledge', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'back', '115', 'minutes.Perhaps', ""'m"", 'slow', 'ignorant', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'reviewers', 'will', 'pin', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'movies', 'years', 'one', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'being', 'quality', 'film', 'Had', 'been', 'shorter', 'equipped', 'bit', 'more', 'excitement', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'compelling', 'Modern', 'horror', 'thriving', 'quite', 'well', 'what', 'many', 'critics', 'tell', 'world', 'film', ""n't"", 'exemplify', 'Martyrs', 'Descent', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'actual', 'quality', 'Asian', 'horror', 'cinema', 'Others', 'even', 'Saw', 'movies', 'contain', 'good', 'plots', 'themes', 'being', 'favorite', 'whipping', 'boys', 'critics', 'content', ""n't"", 'even', 'exist', 'series', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'more', 'compelling', 'examples', 'good', 'modern', 'horror', 'movies', 'beat', 'out', 'Audition', 'day', 'week']",N/A

O'Blenis,"[1, 2]","A Japanese movie producer, Aoyama, widowed and starting to feel lonely as he heads into middle age and his son grows up, concocts a scheme with a friend and fellow producer to snag himself a romantic partner.  In a plot straight out of a slapstick romantic comedy, the two begin holding studio auditions for the lead female role in an upcoming (and incidentally, non-existant) project, in hopes that Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi ofThe Grudge (Unrated Director's Cut),The Grudge 2 (Unrated Director's Cut), andSuicide Club (Suicide Circle)) and one of the lovely young actresses trying out for the part will hit it off.  The actress Aoyama ends up falling for is a girl named Asami (the beautiful Eihi Shiina), who he indeed does end up getting involved with.  It starts off with a comedy-sounding plot, then seems to be developing into a sweet, though at times rather tense, romantic drama.  Except for those little moments that crop up suggesting something is...off...and then making it apparant that there's something far more than just 'off' or unusual taking place.""Audition"" evolves into one of the scariest and most sinister horror movies to ever creep up on you, a wonderful, twisted treat that might have you wanting to burrow under the cushions to safety, as Aoyama begins to have questions about this new woman in his life, and if she might have secrets unknown to him.  Spectacularly well-made and jarringly realistic, superbly acted (with its two leads especially deserving of praise), it's often a quiet movie - literally, not metaphorically, as some parts of the film are similar to the almost-silent-movie air of much of director Takashi Miike's 'Box' segment in3 Extremes.  Audition has some of the most memorable moments of horror - both psychologically and visually - out there, and is one of Japan's best offerings in the field of mystery and terror.",5,Atmospheric And Razor-Sharp Horror,1197936000,"12 18, 2007",2007,1862,"['Japanese', 'movie', 'producer', 'Aoyama', 'widowed', 'starting', 'feel', 'lonely', 'middle', 'age', 'son', 'up', 'scheme', 'friend', 'fellow', 'producer', 'snag', 'romantic', 'partner', 'plot', 'straight', 'slapstick', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'two', 'begin', 'holding', 'studio', 'auditions', 'lead', 'female', 'role', 'upcoming', 'incidentally', 'non-existant', 'project', 'hopes', 'Aoyama', 'Ryo', 'Ishibashi', 'ofThe', 'Grudge', 'Unrated', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Grudge', '2', 'Unrated', 'Director', 'Cut', 'andSuicide', 'Club', 'Suicide', 'Circle', 'one', 'lovely', 'young', 'actresses', 'trying', 'out', 'part', 'will', 'hit', 'off', 'actress', 'Aoyama', 'up', 'falling', 'girl', 'named', 'Asami', 'beautiful', 'Eihi', 'Shiina', 'who', 'indeed', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'involved', 'comedy-sounding', 'plot', 'then', 'be', 'developing', 'sweet', 'though', 'times', 'rather', 'tense', 'romantic', 'drama', 'little', 'moments', 'crop', 'up', 'suggesting', 'something', 'then', 'making', 'apparant', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'just', ""'off"", 'unusual', 'taking', 'place', 'Audition', 'one', 'scariest', 'most', 'sinister', 'horror', 'movies', 'ever', 'creep', 'up', 'wonderful', 'twisted', 'treat', 'might', 'have', 'wanting', 'burrow', 'cushions', 'safety', 'Aoyama', 'have', 'questions', 'new', 'woman', 'life', 'might', 'have', 'secrets', 'unknown', 'Spectacularly', 'well-made', 'jarringly', 'realistic', 'superbly', 'acted', 'two', 'leads', 'especially', 'deserving', 'praise', 'often', 'quiet', 'movie', 'literally', 'not', 'metaphorically', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'similar', 'almost-silent-movie', 'air', 'much', 'director', 'Takashi', 'Miike', ""'Box"", 'segment', 'in3', 'Extremes', 'Audition', 'most', 'memorable', 'moments', 'horror', 'psychologically', 'visually', 'there', 'one', 'Japan', 'best', 'offerings', 'field', 'mystery', 'terror']",N/A

The movie starts slow and methodical and finishes in a conclusion that is so intense that you will not want to look away.  You will be disgusted and enchanted by Asami at the same time.The movie is definately a social commentary on Japanese men and women, and their perceived gender roles.  Similarly it is a commentary on what could happen if the wrong guy picks up the wrong ""docile"" girl.  Get ready for a few pretty hardcore scenes of violence.  But even through the violence Asami still maintains her elegant, feminine poise.  The movie is definately filled with black humor, gore, violence and even has a nice beautiful love story in it.  The movie is great and is a must see for horror fans.If you do not have the stomach for torture or violence, you might be better of sticking with the book.

697345,A1PRY0O2MLYQ40,B0000640S9,Steve Sanders,"[3, 3]","So I finally watched Takashi Miike's infamous Audition and let me say that this film lived up to all it's hype but in a different way.I am just recently beginning to try and watch all of his films after seeing the shocking and insanely good Ichi The Killer.So after hearing renowned directors of horror such as Eli Roth and Rob Zombie talk specifically about this film on a special on Bravo I made this one my must see before I descended into Miike's madness.Now I knew a little of this film,let me say I knew of it's reputation and that it is one of only four of his horror films.I heard that it had some torture and other disturbing content.spoiler alerts:So me and my buddy sat down and popped it on and prepared,now it is not your typical horror/torture/gory film by any means it moves at a brooding almost a little boring pace but it is a very effective and intelligent directing strategy.So those expecting a Japanese Saw that is not the case.The film begins rather charmingly with a man tragically losing his wife to an illness and jumps ahead 7 years to him and his son's relationship which is close but his son is a teenager now with a girlfreind and his own life and just doesn't need his dad for company as much anymore.So him and his buddy who both work in TV come up with a smart but semi sleazy idea to hold a false audition so he can meet and hopefully find a new mate.The audition scene is very amusing and being a lover of asian women a very sexy scene with lots of cute japanese women shedding clothes,giggling,and just being cute.finally the 3rd to last audition steals his attention and his heart.She comes off as the kind of woman evry man would want.Obediant,cute,soft spoken almost resembling a little angelic like school girl.His freind is not as impressed though and does some digging into her past and her resume.Turns out most of it if not all of it is a lie and even more creepy her old boss who she said was her current employer has been missing for a year,just dissapeared.So he says don't call her,then the eerieness of the film begins we see her hunched over with no exprssion on her face in a vacant like room waiting intently by the phone,the only furniture like thing we see is a big burlap sack,then when he finally breaks down and calls her we cut back to almost an identical scene,her sitting in the same spot,same postion as what were lead to beleive she was sitting in days ago when we saw her last.Then the phone rings and we see the most creepy and mischiefious grin come across her face then that same burlap sack moves and rolls across the room,then it cuts to them in a resturaunt talking.Absolute proof of just fantastic directing,just letting things build to the point where you know something very sinister is not only currently happening but what is to come when her true nature comes about.The film continues in it's brooding pace with a dark undertone just looming over,your thinking when his he gonna clue in and investigate this mystery woman whom he has already caught in a lie more then once but is just to star struck to say anything.Then he finally does it he goes to her reidence from her resume that turns out to be a abandoned,run down old ballerina studio.There he meets her uncle and we find out where some of her scars came from in a truly disturbing flashback to her childhhod then it cuts to another scene where we are in the point of view of the woman out side of his house and she sneaks right on in.By this point we know something bad is about to go down,The man comes home and pours his routine glass of scotch but it's a little stronger then usual and he collapses to the floor.What follows next is a retro dream that is very David Lynch like and is a good 10 minutes of wtf is going on,then we find out why this film is the # 11 scary movie of all time.I don't want to give too much away but let me say that the final 20 minutes of this film will disturb you and stay with you for awhile.It's not even that it's that gory or violent compared to Zombie and Roth's films and even Miike's other films the gore is pretty tamed.It's just the sadism and the enjoyment in the acts that just shock you and that it's happening to an absolute saint of a human being and what we discover is in the sack makes the gimp from Pulp Fiction look like a cute puppy.Do yourself a favor if you are a true horror fan who truly appreciates real horror such as mood,story and power over just blood,guts and a body count then watch Takashi's Audition.I found it to be the most creepy and disturbing film since Texas Chainsaw Massacre(1974) don't let the negative reviews that say it's slow and boring derail you,the slow pace and build up is what makes this film especially the shocking climax all the more powerful and proves why Takashi Miike is not only Japan's finest director but internationally in the top 3 best filmakers around period,the other to being Qeuntin Tarantino and Oliver Stone.So check this film out now,also check out City of lost souls and Ichi the killer 2 other fantastic Miike films but vastly different another plus to this movie is that it is one of 4 horror films by Miike I havn't seen 2 of them yet but I have seen masters of horror's Imprint which is amazing as well so if you like this also check the others out..",4,Deeply Disturbing,1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,5293,"['So', 'finally', 'watched', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'infamous', 'Audition', 'let', 'say', 'film', 'lived', 'up',

697348,A3HK5EM5F8MT8H,B0000640S9,"T. Crockett ""Homebrewer""","[11, 13]","I will not go over plot points already covered in other reviews, but rather add another dimension to the discussion of the horror / gore aspect of the movie.In my view, the horrific and gory scenes of Aoyama being drugged, dismembered and so on are all dreamt. That is, everything between Aoyama being covered with a sheet after entering the bed with Asami and his waking up to fetch a glass of water is a dream. The dream continues after he goes back to bed.To put it simply, at the surface level, the movie is a psychologically acute and well acted drama about the growing relationship between Asami and Aoyama. Now, just as vintage horror fans will tell you, that which is implied is far more subtly terrifying than simple splatter and gore. The torture and punishment Aoyama undergoes at the hands of Asami is a nightmare firmly rooted in the narrative of the so-called boring build-up to these gut-wrenching scenes.An attentive look at the first three quarters of the movie reveals how motifs, phrases, and the emotional 'baggage' brought by each protagonist to the relationship are reworked in Aoyama's subconscious into a terrifying nightmare.It is to the writer's credit that this nightmare follows dream-logic in a way that is still cinematic and accessible. It is a dream which reveals much about the character of Aoyama, and nothing at all about Asami. (In fact, through the whole film, she is more an object of his gaze and interpretation than a subject narrating her own experience.)Does this mean that this movie should not be classified as a horror film? In my view, it is better seen, and only makes sense, at the level of an insightful, character driven drama about the guilt-complex of a traditional middle-aged man decided upon marrying a younger woman with some baggage of her own. Her 'baggage' is, of course, only alluded to, but it is enough for Aoyama's imagination to work into a powerful expression of his own fears and sense of guilt. And, likeable as the character of Aoyama is, there is enough for his guilt to chew on: he has used the artificial and deceptive 'audition' to find himself a wife. He was against the idea but talked into it by his coworker. Is it so strange that his subconscious should reproach him for it? He is remarrying after the death of his first wife through illness. Is it so strange that she should reappear in the dream sequence to warn him against Asami? And Asami herself is somewhat of a mysterious character. She is marrying a far older man. Why? And why isn't she already involved with someone. She has had a difficult upbringing. What emotional scars might it have left on her? The character herself, so brilliantly acted, also conveys a negative 'vibe' in the way some people just seem to do.This is a movie in which the 'male' gaze is very much the primary one. The story is told from his point of view. But the female has her own revenge. She intrudes through the workings of his subconscious, complicated by his doubts and his repressed sense of guilt. If she must be objectified in the manner she is, an unattached female drawn out of a short-list of viable female candidates and turned into a dutiful wife, then she might just become, potentially a rather nasty object. In the strange, reverse world of the dream, she has become the active subject, and he is the drugged and immobile victim of her tortures and punishments. .Why, then, is the movie always referred to as a horror film? In short, it needed to be promoted as such to get an audience. If the reviews here are anything to go by, it certainly seems to have been received as such.But it is so much more than a horror flick, one-and-a-half hours more in fact. It is NOT a horror film with good characterization, but an insightful romantic drama with a violent undertone of personal and cultural repression. In fact, I would say that it is unique in standing between the two genres, linking the two and transgressing the bounds of both, for if horror films are so often characterless splatterfests, then romantic dramas are also often guilty of being superficial, sugary twaddle.

At first giving the appearance of a romantic comedy, Miike's deliberately paced facade vanishes in the blink of a pierced eyelid and concludes with perhaps the most agonizingly vivid torture scene ever filmed.The movie has a deceptively lighthearted premise and is even rather charming to begin with. An aging father whose wife passed away some time ago is urged by his friends and his son to try dating again. Shigeharu (Ryo Ishibashi) agrees to participate in a fake audition staged by a filmmaker friend in order to interview potential candidates to be his new wife. Despite his friend's objections, Shigeharu chooses Asami (Eihi Shiina), a young former ballerina whose past is shrouded in mystery. After several dates Asami seems like the perfect match for the aging bachelor, but upon his decision to propose to the timid girl, things quickly spiral out of control into a hellish nightmare he cannot escape.While gore is no stranger to Audition, Miike's most effective strategy lies within his deceitful manipulation of reality. Flashbacks, ghostly imagery, and dream sequences betray possible truths and horrifying realities, and the unpredictability of these scenes offers more wrenching anticipation and unnerving apprehension of just how harrowing Shigeharu and Asami's situation will become. The sadistic climax proposes an illusory avenue of escape, one so craftily devised it has often been copied, but never equaled.Certainly not for the squeamish, Audition does commendably incite thrills for its genuine creepiness and the nerve-shattering fusion of conflicting genres. This early work from Miike is a true test of backbone for even the most jaded gorehound and cleverly mocks the traditional tactics of western horror films.

Well for me it was.For some people this movie will move &#34;too slow&#34;.  those those people I would say that you probably won't/don't enjoy some of the better &#34;horror&#34; films from Japan/S. Korea/Thailand because Asian &#34;horror&#34; tends to be more psychological and slower paced.  They're not the go for the gore from the start type of movies - usually.  I'm not talking the real extreme stuff (ex: Guinea Pig, which NO I haven't watched, even I have limits).  I'm talking more like A Tale of Two Sisters, Kairo, Ringu (not to be confused with the very cool FX but completely different story The Ring).Watch this movie closely - the slow parts.  You might want to watch it more than once to pick up on some of the more subtle nuances ex: Shigeharu Aoyama turning his wife's picture around, for instance - there are reasons for just about everything in this movie.  Some won't make sense, especially to the normal Western mindset.  Like, why did Asami Yamazaki allow the branding and other abuses?The last half hour?  Oh, it's ON!  Now, you will need to have a bit of a strong stomach and yeah, probably a bit of a twisted sense of humor for one specific thing (the window &#34;splat&#34; cracked me up).  Yes, Asami is very, very, very, VERY disturbed.  That's why you need to pay attention to the rest of the movie and be patient - take in as much as you can to try to get into Asami's head even a little.I will say, it's been noted that Rob Zombie found this difficult to watch (really?!), so if you're squeamish this probably isn't for you.

When he is going out with the girl of his dreams he is in love, and his mind chooses not to see the bad things.  He thinks he has a pleasant conversation with her, drives her home, and drops her off on the street.  In reality, she tells him about the abuse, and then takes him back to her apartment where he discovers that she keeps her last boyfriend inside a bag (sans an ear, his tongue, and a bunch of fingers) and only feeds him her own vomit.
