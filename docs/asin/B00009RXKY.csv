757486,A1WXV2M71VH7TH,B00009RXKY,A woman,"[5, 6]","This is not high-class dancing. Rania and Marina, though energetic and creative, don't seem to possess sufficiently polished techniques. They also don't seem to be able to control their facial expressions and, as a result, look very tense. Rania often looks more like a soldier rather than a dancer. And her profound bellyrolls impress not so much with their trickiness as with their grossness... Although there was one dance which I kind of liked: she finally looked so free and innocent (in that tender lavender outfit).Similarly, only one of Marina's performances I found enjoyable. It's a lovely blend of a Persian dance and bellydance, somewhat folkloric, yet not simplistic, and very graceful. The slow veil dance wasn't too bad. In her other 3 numbers, Marina loses fluidity of movements too often, and looks rather frantic.Sohaila's moves are very smooth, but I feel that something is missing in all her 4 dances...  Maybe the choreography isn't interesting enough. Maybe it's the music that I find really boring.Louchia's 2 very folkloric pieces are not true bellydances.I liked most of the costumes (especially Sohaila's), and found the music for Rania's and Marina's performances to be igniting. I was impressed with Rania's props incorporation. She uses them in 5 of her 7 numbers (sword, cane, Isis wings, and veils).",3,"So-so dancing (but good props use, costumes, and music)",1146355200,"04 30, 2006",2006,1330,"['not', 'high-class', 'dancing', 'Rania', 'Marina', 'energetic', 'creative', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'possess', 'sufficiently', 'polished', 'techniques', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'control', 'facial', 'expressions', 'result', 'look', 'very', 'tense', 'Rania', 'often', 'more', 'soldier', 'rather', 'dancer', 'profound', 'bellyrolls', 'impress', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'trickiness', 'grossness', 'was', 'one', 'dance', 'kind', 'liked', 'finally', 'looked', 'so', 'free', 'innocent', 'tender', 'lavender', 'outfit', '.Similarly', 'only', 'one', 'Marina', 'performances', 'found', 'enjoyable', 'lovely', 'blend', 'Persian', 'dance', 'bellydance', 'somewhat', 'folkloric', 'yet', 'not', 'simplistic', 'very', 'graceful', 'slow', 'veil', 'dance', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'other', '3', 'numbers', 'Marina', 'fluidity', 'movements', 'too', 'often', 'rather', 'frantic.Sohaila', 'moves', 'are', 'very', 'smooth', 'feel', 'something', 'missing', '4', 'dances', 'Maybe', 'choreography', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'enough', 'Maybe', 'music', 'find', 'really', 'boring.Louchia', '2', 'very', 'folkloric', 'pieces', 'are', 'not', 'true', 'bellydances.I', 'liked', 'most', 'costumes', 'especially', 'Sohaila', 'found', 'music', 'Rania', 'Marina', 'performances', 'be', 'igniting', 'was', 'impressed', 'Rania', 'props', 'incorporation', '5', '7', 'numbers', 'sword', 'cane', 'Isis', 'wings', 'veils']",N/A

I've read in other reviews that much of the stuff here can be found on extras in other dvds through Natural Journeys. Possibly, I've got all Bellytwins and some other stuff, but they're bought a ways back and are on video, so I haven't benefited from those extras. But I did enjoy the dvd. There are four dancers, Rania probably the best known with all her fitness dvds out there. There is a variety of dancing, and each number is introduced with a brief description of the type of dancing, kind of song, and a couple other details (e.g., you usually don't see a dancer in Egypt showing her stomach). It was fun the watch the different styles and it can inspire you maybe try something different. I also have the bellydance superstars dvd, which I personally prefer. It has many more dancers on it, though each does only two numbers, and some of them I wish had done more, many more, especially. With this divas DVD, some dancers dance a lot more (Rania has something like six or seven numbers, while the first dancer only has two or three). I liked seeing the different costumes, too, where some looked like they were dancing in stretchy evening gowns while others were more what is usually seen (sexier I Dream of Jeannie fare). Overall, though, I liked it a lot and enjoy the performances,",4,Fun to view,1120003200,"06 29, 2005",2005,1347,"['bought', 'finding', 'accident', 'store', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'much', 'stuff', 'here', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'extras', 'other', 'dvds', 'Natural', 'Journeys', 'Possibly', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Bellytwins', 'other', 'stuff', ""'re"", 'bought', 'ways', 'back', 'are', 'video', 'so', 'have', ""n't"", 'benefited', 'extras', 'did', 'enjoy', 'dvd', 'are', 'four', 'dancers', 'Rania', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'fitness', 'dvds', 'there', 'variety', 'dancing', 'number', 'introduced', 'brief', 'description', 'type', 'dancing', 'kind', 'song', 'couple', 'other', 'details', 'e.g.', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'dancer', 'Egypt', 'showing', 'stomach', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'different', 'styles', 'can', 'inspire', 'maybe', 'try', 'something', 'different', 'also', 'have', 'bellydance', 'superstars', 'dvd', 'personally', 'prefer', 'many', 'more', 'dancers', 'only', 'two', 'numbers', 'wish', 'had', 'done', 'more', 'many', 'more', 'especially', 'divas', 'DVD', 'dancers', 'dance', 'lot', 'more', 'Rania', 'something', 'six', 'seven', 'numbers', 'first', 'dancer', 'only', 'two', 'three', 'liked', 'seeing', 'different', 'costumes', 'too', 'where', 'looked', 'were', 'dancing', 'stretchy', 'evening', 'gowns', 'others', 'were', 'more', 'what', 'usually', 'seen', 'sexier', 'Dream', 'Jeannie', 'fare', 'Overall', 'liked', 'lot', 'enjoy', 'performances']",N/A

757492,A18AJZ4NYUMFG6,B00009RXKY,Parthena Black,"[6, 7]","I'm surprised at all the negative reviews. But then, I guess I'm a little strange in that when I become involved in something, I do want to know the history and significance it carries.Nowhere on its cover does this dvd claim to have ""original performances"" or any of the other elements reviewers knock it down for. It doesn't claim that any of the dancers are ""world renowned,"" have won any awards or are even famous. The dvd is simply a presentation of the different styles of bellydance as performed by four different dancers.  It does not claim to be inspirational or instructional. It only claims to showcase the various styles of bellydance as explained by the narrator, including the meaning of the individual dances, the music typically used and the costuming and props. Since traditional dances are being performed, they are not supposed to be original.I was actually looking for Bellydance Superstars and this was the only one the store had. I was looking for other dancers to observe while I relax at home since I won't be able to go to the once a year Bellydance Superstars performance in my state.The performances show some styles I'd never actually seen before - and probably might never see because I live in the Bible Belt where bellydance is seen as sleazy and too ""foreign.""  The dancers are wonderful and skilled and the music and photography are beautiful.  It's also a fabulous costume show. The dvd shows Egyptian, Turkish, Cabaret and Persian dance.  Veils, swords, canes and Isis wings are incorporated. This dvd has just about everything. As a dancer, I do find that I am inspired by some of the individual dancers' styles. For instance, I wasn't sure that I wanted to roll around on the floor with my sword but Rania did it so well that I may give it a try.If you bought the dvd and weren't happy, you might have done well to read the description on the label. Another clue could be that it's produced by Natural Journeys, a company that sells bellydance fitness videos. This dvd is likely a marketing strategy to entice people to buy their other videos. I do agree that the title is very misleading.This dvd is for those who are new to bellydance, those who are interested in learning about the different cultural aspects, dances and costuming or just have a casual interest in bellydance.

It's really quite educational. The dancers are all poised and graceful, and the use of the standards along with some more modern music is well done.Con's:  For being called ""diva's"" I would have expected a bit more fire, a bit more passion in the performances.
