1075832,AMP7TQRWAIE84,B000QFCDAO,"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D""","[5, 5]","This show is about a ALL-American family, who's members add uniqueness to it. Everyone is completely different in their own ways, and I have grown to love them all although Carrie (Amy Davidson) is my favorite: She was moody, confused and hurt and overall, grouchy, pessimistic and a smartass. I adored her. Still do!!Anyway, they all have every day problems: Carrie with her looks (she's so pretty), school, BOYS, her sister's popularity and beauty (Carrie's a bit prettier) and just being an outcast overall. Bridgett's main problem was boy issues: Her current boyfriend, Kyle, is DUMB AS R O C K S but somehow, they fit. I remember a spicy episode when Bridgette was gone and Carrie was on the couch with Kyle...Guess what happened? They locked lips. It was sweet and tender, but Carrie regretted it right after.  I think she even went as far as running back upstairs!Rory, the youngest teen, had problems with girls sometimes but usually, it was HE who was the problem; firecrackers, hidden (craftily, I might add) under his bed, in a box, UNDER a board that has pictures placed on top. He's my second favorite character.Cate is a mom; overworked, under paid yet perserverance like no other. She was always very worried about her growing children's well-beings but most of them (besides Rory) pushed her away, especially Bridget.Paul, the father was very worried about his kids too; more so than the mother. He always tried to cater to their every needs, E S P E C I A L L Y Bridget's. ^_^Jim, the grandpa is a one in a million treasure. He was super-funny, and truthful and made a lot of sense. We can call him the voice of reason and logic of the show!Lastly, C.J., my third favorite character was the ""Loser"" of the family. He was actually their cousin, who stayed in the basement, and could barely ever do anything right. Finally, he went off to college and got his act together, after the Army or whatever. He is the second funniest, behind grandpa Jim and ahead of Rory. But Rory is by far the most goofy, yet adorable character in the series.Too bad Ritter died (R.I.P., my Man) because the series could've went up from there; Bridget could have went to college, Carrie could have followed and soon, Rory would too.Cover Art: B-Inside Art: N/ADisc Art: N/AStory: B-Characters: AComic Relief: B+Drama: A-Length: A++4.25 stars.Overall: B-",4,Super-enjoyable and almost perfect.,1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,2347,"['show', 'ALL-American', 'family', 'who', 'members', 'add', 'uniqueness', 'Everyone', 'completely', 'different', 'own', 'ways', 'have', 'grown', 'love', 'Carrie', 'Amy', 'Davidson', 'favorite', 'was', 'moody', 'confused', 'hurt', 'overall', 'grouchy', 'pessimistic', 'smartass', 'adored', 'Still', 'do', 'Anyway', 'have', 'day', 'problems', 'Carrie', 'looks', 'so', 'pretty', 'school', 'BOYS', 'sister', 'popularity', 'beauty', 'Carrie', 'bit', 'prettier', 'just', 'being', 'outcast', 'overall', 'Bridgett', 'main', 'problem', 'was', 'boy', 'issues', 'current', 'boyfriend', 'Kyle', 'DUMB', 'AS', 'R', 'O', 'C', 'K', 'S', 'somehow', 'fit', 'remember', 'spicy', 'episode', 'when', 'Bridgette', 'was', 'gone', 'Carrie', 'was', 'couch', 'Kyle', 'Guess', 'what', 'happened', 'locked', 'lips', 'was', 'sweet', 'tender', 'Carrie', 'regretted', 'right', 'think', 'even', 'went', 'as', 'far', 'running', 'back', 'upstairs', 'Rory', 'youngest', 'teen', 'had', 'problems', 'girls', 'sometimes', 'usually', 'was', 'HE', 'who', 'was', 'problem', 'firecrackers', 'hidden', 'craftily', 'might', 'add', 'bed', 'box', 'UNDER', 'board', 'pictures', 'placed', 'top', 'second', 'favorite', 'character.Cate', 'mom', 'overworked', 'paid', 'yet', 'perserverance', 'other', 'was', 'always', 'very', 'worried', 'growing', 'children', 'well-beings', 'most', 'Rory', 'pushed', 'away', 'especially', 'Bridget.Paul', 'father', 'was', 'very', 'worried', 'kids', 'too', 'more', 'so', 'mother', 'always', 'tried', 'cater', 'needs', 'E', 'S', 'P', 'E', 'C', 'A', 'L', 'L', 'Y', 'Bridget', '^_^Jim', 'grandpa', 'one', 'million', 'treasure', 'was', 'super-funny', 'truthful', 'made', 'lot', 'sense', 'can', 'call', 'voice', 'reason', 'logic', 'show', 'Lastly', 'C.J.', 'third', 'favorite', 'character', 'was', 'Loser', 'family', 'was', 'actually', 'cousin', 'who', 'stayed', 'basement', 'could', 'barely', 'ever', 'do', 'anything', 'right', 'Finally', 'went', 'college', 'got', 'act', 'together', 'Army', 'second', 'funniest', 'grandpa', 'Jim', 'ahead', 'Rory', 'Rory', 'far', 'most', 'goofy', 'yet', 'adorable', 'character', 'series.Too', 'bad', 'Ritter', 'died', 'R.I.P.', 'Man', 'series', 'could', ""'ve"", 'went', 'up', 'there', 'Bridget', 'could', 'have', 'went', 'college', 'Carrie', 'could', 'have', 'followed', 'soon', 'Rory', 'would', 'too.Cover', 'Art', 'B-Inside', 'Art', 'N/ADisc', 'Art', 'N/AStory', 'B-Characters', 'AComic', 'Relief', 'B+Drama', 'A-Length', 'A++4.25', 'stars.Overall', 'B-']",N/A

Ritter is Paul Hennessy,a sportswriter who is a loving and protective father of two girls,age 16 and 11 or 12. The girls' mother is Paul's wife Cate(Sagal). Paul just typically warns boyfriends to treat his elder daughter with care. This ABC sitcom premiered on Ritter's 54th birthday,September 17,2002. Ritter has many other September family events,those being his widow Amy Yasbeck's birthday on the 12th,their daughter Stella's birthday on the 11th(Ritter succumbed to a sudden heart ailment on Stella's fourth birthday in 2003) and Ritter's and Yasbeck's wedding anniversary on the 18th(they were married one week after Stella's birth). Many remember Ritter's portrayal of Jack Tripper on TC and its not-too-popular spinoff TAC(both ABC alumni). Many also remember Sagal's portrayal of the gorgeous but lazy housewife Peggy Bundy on MWC,Fox's inaugural series that ran from 1987 to 1997. Ritter died just after this sitcom's second season began production at the Burbank,California hospital he was born in in 1948. That hospital stands across from the studio where 8SRFDMTD was taped. After Ritter's death,writers had Paul dropping dead of a heart attack while grocery shopping. Many viewers believed that the show wasn't too great without Ritter. That's probably why the show got the Nielsen axe after 2004-05. Throughout the series,several respective castmates of Ritter's and Sagal's guest starred such as Ed O'Neill and the late Don Knotts.

1075842,A2U98U588AUS7C,B000QFCDAO,Foggy Tewsday,"[1, 1]","`8 Simple Rules' is one of those shows that can be watched over and over again. I don't know how many times I've seen these first season episodes on television, but I never get tired of seeing Paul Hennessy (John Ritter) being run ragged by his teenage daughters, the superficial yet supremely confident Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), and the more serious-minded but fragile Kerry (Amy Davidson). The youngest member of the Hennessy clan, and the only other male in the house is Rory (Martin Spanjers). His main ambition is to own a monkey, or, failing that, something poisonous.  Paul's wife, Cate (Katey Sagal) tries to make sense of the pandemonium that seems to engulf their lives. ""I swear to God, Paul,"" is her exasperated constant refrain as her husband tries to keep their daughters' affection while at the same time doing his best to limit any funny business that he thinks their boyfriends may have in mind.So what makes this sitcom better than any number of other family-based shows? I think it's the performances that all the actors bring to their characters and the razor-sharp scripts. There are 28 episodes in this first season and there's not a dud among them. Although John Ritter has the lead role, the rest of the cast gets a good share of the laughs and most of the stories revolve around Bridget and Kerry's lives. The strength of the guest stars helps too, notably Larry Miller as Paul's unscrupulous colleague, Tommy who is also the father of Bridget's none too bright boyfriend, Kyle (Billy Aaron Brown), and Patrick Warburton as Paul's boss, Nick Sharpe whose own life bears an uncanny resemblance to Paul's.There are far too many highlights to list here in their entirety, but some of my favorite moments are: the `Three's Company' spoof in episode 16; the moment when Bridget and her nemesis, Jenna Sharpe (Nikki Danielle Moore) square up to each other gunfighter-style, ""Whatever,"" says Jenna viciously to which Bridget responds with a sharp intake of breath as though this was the worst insult possible; the studio audience's reaction when they see Cate just about to enter the girls' bedroom as Rory is rescuing his stash of girlie magazines that his sisters have confiscated; the hysterically awful cheerleader auditions that Kerry turns to her advantage; and Rory's reaction to seeing the new-look Aunt Maggie (Cybill Shepherd) in the season's final episode.It would have been nice to have some cast interviews or commentaries included in this set, but the only bonus material in the package is a blooper reel.

There was a special two part show entitled ""Goodbye in season 2 for the loss of John Ritter. After that, there was a few following episodes that dealt with the family coping with their loss and the stress of the children losing there father. I thought that the show would never be the same after that but it quickly picked back up pace, in which the show survived until after the third season and then came to an end.
