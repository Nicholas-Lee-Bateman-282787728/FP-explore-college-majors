1679828,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00GO4RGWQ,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","THE INEVITABLE DEFEAT of MISTER & PETE (""IDMP"") is not quite as fully realized a story as 2009'sPrecious, but it has much the same atmosphere and shares the gritty down-and-out NYC setting. In other respects, it's a VERY different sort of film. Often stark, frequently amusing, IDMP goes in many unexpected directions.Partly by necessity, it's rather slow-moving, with regular bits of heavy suspense here and there. 60-70% (perhaps a bit too much) of it is confined to the abandoned apartment where the two young boys hide after Mister's mother is arrested. Though far from boring, with a number of turnabouts, IDMP may not fully satisfy those who are expecting more of an urban odyssey.Skylan Brooks (14-year-old Mister) and Ethan Dizon (Pete, about six years younger) are naturals in their roles, and Brooks does a particularly outstanding job of acting-within-acting. Anthony Mackie also gives a laudable performance as Kris the pimp/drug dealer. Yet, the characters of Mister and Pete are hard to buy in certain respects. Mister seems a bit TOO noble and crafty for a young boy from his background who's failing eighth grade and usually just screams ""F__ you!"" and runs off when he gets frustrated. Having said that, I think the point is that having Pete, who's been even more neglected than Mister himself, as a surrogate little brother and ally against the oppressive adult world brings out the true potential in Mister, who also discovers the useful and liberating qualities of acting and role-playing in life's struggles. Pete also seems a bit too polite and well-spoken considering his age and background, but again, something would be lost if he were otherwise. One way or another, IDMP is a very rich multi-character study of different people in squalid circumstances. It also shows the ethnically diverse atmosphere of Brooklyn without falling to the stereotypes we often get in this type of setting.",4,"""I can't do it alone"". . . .""None of us can""",1392595200,"02 17, 2014",2014,1912,"['INEVITABLE', 'DEFEAT', 'MISTER', 'PETE', 'IDMP', 'not', 'quite', 'fully', 'realized', 'story', ""2009'sPrecious"", 'much', 'same', 'atmosphere', 'shares', 'gritty', 'down-and-out', 'NYC', 'setting', 'other', 'respects', 'VERY', 'different', 'sort', 'film', 'Often', 'stark', 'frequently', 'amusing', 'IDMP', 'many', 'unexpected', 'directions.Partly', 'necessity', 'rather', 'slow-moving', 'regular', 'bits', 'heavy', 'suspense', 'here', 'there', '60-70', '%', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'confined', 'abandoned', 'apartment', 'where', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'hide', 'Mister', 'mother', 'arrested', 'far', 'boring', 'number', 'turnabouts', 'IDMP', 'may', 'not', 'fully', 'satisfy', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'more', 'urban', 'odyssey.Skylan', 'Brooks', '14-year-old', 'Mister', 'Ethan', 'Dizon', 'Pete', 'six', 'years', 'younger', 'are', 'naturals', 'roles', 'Brooks', 'particularly', 'outstanding', 'job', 'acting-within-acting', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'also', 'laudable', 'performance', 'Kris', 'pimp/drug', 'dealer', 'characters', 'Mister', 'Pete', 'are', 'hard', 'buy', 'certain', 'respects', 'Mister', 'bit', 'TOO', 'noble', 'crafty', 'young', 'boy', 'background', 'who', 'failing', 'eighth', 'grade', 'usually', 'just', 'screams', 'F__', 'runs', 'off', 'when', 'frustrated', 'Having', 'said', 'think', 'point', 'having', 'Pete', 'who', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'neglected', 'Mister', 'surrogate', 'little', 'brother', 'ally', 'oppressive', 'adult', 'world', 'out', 'true', 'potential', 'Mister', 'who', 'also', 'useful', 'liberating', 'qualities', 'acting', 'role-playing', 'life', 'struggles', 'Pete', 'also', 'bit', 'too', 'polite', 'well-spoken', 'considering', 'age', 'background', 'again', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'lost', 'were', 'otherwise', 'One', 'way', 'IDMP', 'very', 'rich', 'multi-character', 'study', 'different', 'people', 'squalid', 'circumstances', 'also', 'ethnically', 'diverse', 'atmosphere', 'Brooklyn', 'falling', 'stereotypes', 'often', 'get', 'type', 'setting']",N/A

He takes the fragile younger boy Pete under his wing to help him get through the summer. Both of their mothers are out of the picture, in jail or gone missing. The food runs out, the electricity is turned off, and they're both evading the cops who will pick them up and take them to the dreaded Riverview juvenile care facility if they find out that their parents have abandoned them.

I am not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't this little gem of a movie. I know people have compared it to the movie ""Precious"" (which I never saw, but read the book ""Push""), and if that was any indication, I wasn't looking forward to it. I was one of those rare people who didn't enjoy Sapphire's book of the abused and tortured young girl, Precious. It was a little too depressing for me. Anyway, the story of ""Mister & Pete"" was just the opposite...in the end, you have hope. Your spirits soar and you rejoice and think, if two young kids can survive and make it an entire summer on their own, overcoming the challenges of living in a Brooklyn Housing Project and avoiding Child Services, alone.....then they will survive anything.Mister (yes, that is what his mom named him), a 13-year-old boy is dealing with issues that someone his age shouldn't even know about. He lives in public housing. His mother (who doesn't mind shooting up in front of him) is a drug addicted prostitute. She's even willing to perform a sexual act in a restaurant to pay for dinner. He's failed school and told he will have to repeat his 8th grade year. So what can add to this chaos of his young life....the responsibility and addition of a small 9-year-old named Pete (whose mother is abusive but he believes is a chemist...while in actuality she is an addict, she's cooking meth). As the two scramble for food, avoid the local drug dealers and thieves, and survive for several months on their own, they learn to also dream and have hope.I expected Jennifer Hudson to be decent in the role of his screwed up mother Gloria, which she was, but what I didn't expect was the talent of Skylan Brooks, who played Mister. While he is one of the main characters, I did not expect him to bring the character of Mister to life in such startling detail. He simply captivated the audience like none of the others in the movie did. He's definitely a star on the rise.",5,Heartbreaking and Endearing.

1679839,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00GO4RGWQ,Paul Allaer,"[47, 49]","""The Inevitable Defeat of Mister & Pete"" (2013 release; 108 min.) brings the story of two young boys in the Brooklyn housing projects. As the movie opens, we see Mister flunking his last exam on the final day of his 8th grade school year, and the teacher tells him he'll have to do 8th grade over again. As Mister gets home, we get to know his mom, a drug addict and prostitute who seemingly only cares about the next high. We also meet Pete, a Korean-American kid who is even younger but is staying there as his mom is in equally bad shape (if not worse). As the summer unfolds, Mister's mom eventually also gets arrested, and now Mister and Pete are left alone. Mister thinks/expects that his mom will be released in a few days, two weeks tops, but when she does not return, the boys need to find a way to survive. One thing that keeps Mister going are the auditions coming up in early August for a movie or TV show. Will the boys make it through the summer? Will Mister's mom return? What about Pete's mom? To tell you more would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourseld how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is a tough urban family drama that will not leave you unmoved. One can't but feel terrible for the two boys. They didn't ask for these circumstances. but they neverhtless have to deal with it. At one point Pete asks Mister if it's okay not to love his mom. Mister wistfully responds: ""You can't help but love her but that doesn't mean you have to like her"". Wow. As you can expect, there are lots of notable performances in thsi movie, none more so than newcomer Skylan Brooks as Mister. But Jennifer Hudson as Mister's mom will equally blow you away. When everything is falling apart, she cries out to Mister ""I'm just trying to get things in order"" and your heart aches for her and for Mister. Jordin Sparks as a small but notable role as Alice, Mister's former neighbor who has moved on yet still cares for Mister. Alicia Keys is listed both as an Executive Producer and music co-composer (along with Mark Isham).Imagine my surprise when this movie opened last month without any pre-release hype or advertizing on 2 screens for all of Greater Cincinnati. I was traveling and was afraid I was going to miss it, but thankfully the movie stuck around long enough. The screening I saw this at was, given the movie's difficult material, reasonably well attended, I'm glad to say. If you are in the mood for an outstanding family drama that is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go with this, and I strongly suggest you check this out, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray.

He's mad, he's hurt, but that part is the least of his problems. his mom, Gloria, is a drug addict and prostitute with no shame in her game. When Mister catches her in the bathroom servicing a customer, he goes off on her and she slaps him back. In addition to that, he and Gloria has to watch over Pete, a plucky little Korean American boy of a crack addict who also cooks meth. Mister really doesn't want the little fella there because for one, he's always asking questions, and two, he got his own problems dealing with Gloria and everyday life. Things get further complicated when Gloria is arrested and leaves them by themselves. For the majority of the summer, those two little boys survive as best they can and probably evaded the cops further until Pete got sick and got caught. what a movie.

When he leaves the only place he has to go is home, to his drug addicted and basically absent mother Gloria (Hudson). One day he comes home to find Pete, a kid he knows in his room. Gloria informs Mister they will be taking care of him for a few days but no one sees what is coming next. First of all I have to start by saying this is a fantastic movie but hard to watch. I would compare it to Precious in that way. This one deals with how the kids take care of themselves in the only way they know how rather then living with an abusive mother. The movie is emotionally draining but very much worth seeing especially for the kid playing Mister. He was amazing in this and deserves some sort of nomination. He really brings powerful emotions to this and even when he breaks the law in some scenes you are still rooting for him. I can not say enough about this movie and it deserves to be seen by a larger audience then it will get. Overall, emotionally draining but a must see movie. I highly recommend this.

1679847,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00GO4RGWQ,Turfseer,"[1, 9]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 1.5 out of 5.0'The Inevitable Defeat of Mister and Pete' is a first-time screenplay by Michael Starburry. His protagonist is the 'Mister' of the title played by Skylan Brooks. The plot is rather simple: when Mister's crack-addicted mother (played by Jennifer Hudson of 'Dreamgirls' and 'American Idol' fame) disappears during one particular summer in a Brooklyn public housing project, 12 year old Mister and Pete (an eight year old abused Asian-American kid Mister's mother is supposedly taking care of for a drug addict acquaintance), must fend for themselves.Right off the bat the premise is a bit hard to swallow. Perhaps it's happened in some rare cases, but the idea that two young kids would go unreported for an entire summer without anyone from child protective services being notified, would be a rare event. Nonetheless, 'Mister and Pete' plays out more like a 'fable' than a drama culled from real events.Still, Starburry's narrative suffers from wandering aimlessly throughout the bulk of its second act. The whole idea is that Mister has become hardened by events and characters in his environment. He can no longer act like a normal twelve year old and falls into a shell where he doesn't allow anyone to help him. It's called 'tough guy posturing' and beginning with the overly aggressive Mister cursing his high school teacher out for giving him a failing grade in school (despite his teacher offering him a ride home in his car), we must endure (over and over again) this kid 'with an attitude', until he experiences an epiphany at the denouement.Starburry also attributes an additional character flaw to Mister, more befitting of a young adult: the quest to 'make it big' in the entertainment business. The deluded Mister believes that if he passes an audition for a TV show based in Beverly Hills, this will solve all his problems. He even has Mister reciting a well known scene from the film 'Fargo' as his audition piece, an unlikely choice for a kid from the projects (why does Mister pick 'Fargo'? Is he a film studies major in school? Or is 'Fargo' simply Starburry's favorite movie?).The aforementioned 'tough guy posturing' attributed to our protagonist is the result of a series of interactions that causes Mister to clam up emotionally. The most dramatic of these interactions occurs when he spies his prostitute mother performing a sex act on a man during a bathroom break, while the family has been having lunch.There are additional interactions Mister has with a series of thinly drawn characters from the projects including a bully who at one point beats him up, a gang leader (Anthony Mackie) who gives Mister a wad of money after taking pity on him and a homeless man (Jeffrey Wright), who suddenly warms up to Mister, after the beleaguered kid shares some of his dwindling food supply with the gruff bum on the street.Occasionally, Starburry goes in for cheap stereotypes, like the grocery store owner (was he supposed to be Arabic or Indian?) who attempts to strangle poor little Mister after the kid obnoxiously overturns a few store displays inside the man's store.Only Jordin Sparks manages to temporarily evoke a sympathetic note as Mister's 'adult friend' who promises to help the 'home alone' kids but even she ends up mysteriously vanishing, later revealed to run off with a well-heeled white guy from the suburbs.After resorting to stealing to put food on the table, Mister finally sees the light and runs for 'help' after poor Pete falls ill. This leads to both being discovered as neglected children and ending up in a dreaded juvenile institution (which Mister imagined initially to be some kind of torture chamber). All's well that ends well for Mister, when his mother turns up sober at the facility and reclaims him. But what about little Pete? Presumably he'll remain with the state, until his own mother gets herself together (or will she?).Unlike most reviewers, I did not find Mr. Brooks' performance as the hardened 'Mister', to be at all enjoyable. But whose fault is that? Clearly Mr. Starburry's, as the first time screenwriter boxed himself into a corner by making 'Mister' into a thoroughly obnoxious character throughout. Yes we did get the point that Mister was a victim of his environment, but still, wasn't there a way to make him a little more charming? Perhaps if he was drawn as a more normal kid, he would have had some friends in the neighborhood, who could have helped him and his charge, Pete, out. Or simply Mister didn't have to be depicted as a little tough guy. Of course if he wasn't, Mr. Starburry's entire heavy-handed and rather OBVIOUS narrative would be lost: that his environment (especially the lack of normal motherly love), shaped him into the little monster, that he temporarily became, for one short summer.",1,"Chronicle about prepubescent's 'tough guy posturing' due to a bad environment, proves obvious, repetitious and
