493259,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0000065T4,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","What Gong Li does in `Ju Dou' is beyond astonishing.  In perhaps her finest performance to date (and that is saying a lot for such a brilliant actress), Li delivers a breathtaking, albeit heartbreaking, look at an abused woman scorned by her confinement to a man she cannot love, desperately separated (at least in a complete sense) from the man who can offer her salvation.`Ju Dou' tells the story of Ju Dou, a young woman sold into marriage to the elderly owner of a dye mill.  Her husband is a ruthless and brutal man; unable to produce offspring and obviously violently bitter over it.  He regards Ju Dou with little respect and humiliates her emotionally, mentally and physically.  Ju Dou seeks solace and affection in her husband's nephew; a gentle young man who works in the dye mill.  As a way to escape her lot in life, albeit only partially, Ju Dou falls in love with this young man.  It is their love and impregnation that leads to complications and eventual tragedy within Ju Dou's life; as if her life wasn't already tragic.As a film, `Ju Dou' is straight pain.  There is no light at the end of the tunnel here, but solely emotional devastation.  Even when things appear `brighter' for Ju Dou in her relationship with young Tianqing, it is obvious that things will never be good for her as a whole.  She will only have fleeting moments of seeming happiness; but the words `fleeting' and `seeming' continually take over that narrative.  Some may object to such harsh depictions, but I consider it a strong testament to the director's vision and creative control.  What is even grander is the fact that all three main actors (Gong Li, Li Baotian and Li Wei) underscore their every moment with a complete understanding of their characters eventualities.  They all feel complete and in control of their moments.  Li Wei is effectively evil; delving into the heart of this monster and delivering a terrifying performance.  Boatian broods effectively and fleshes out the pent up frustrations of loving a woman tied to a monster.  But it is Gong Li who steals every ounce of this film.  She is so achingly realistic; so honest and dripping with internal torment.  Just watching her face recoil as she takes in her surroundings.  She delivers such a deeply assertive performance, one that allows her to soak in the atmosphere of the film and project it through her burdened eyes.And what atmosphere there is!  From the colorful set pieces (one only wishes the DVD transfer did it complete justice) to the constrictive yet fluid cinematography, `Ju Dou' is as visually arresting as it is emotionally.Some have balked at the DVD transfer, and as far as that is concerned I must agree, to a degree.  I didn't find it overly offensive (I have seen worse) but I was expecting much better.  Still, the film itself transcends any issues with the DVD itself (although this is one of the many films that deserves top notch DVD treatment and will never receive it because it is not popular enough) and so I highly recommend you see this film any way that you can!",5,That's the way love goes...,1314835200,"09 1, 2011",2011,3058,"['What', 'Gong', 'Li', 'Ju', 'Dou', 'astonishing', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'performance', 'date', 'saying', 'lot', 'brilliant', 'actress', 'Li', 'breathtaking', 'heartbreaking', 'look', 'abused', 'woman', 'scorned', 'confinement', 'man', 'can', 'not', 'love', 'desperately', 'separated', 'least', 'complete', 'sense', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'offer', 'salvation.', 'Ju', 'Dou', 'story', 'Ju', 'Dou', 'young', 'woman', 'sold', 'marriage', 'elderly', 'owner', 'dye', 'mill', 'husband', 'ruthless', 'brutal', 'man', 'unable', 'produce', 'offspring', 'obviously', 'violently', 'bitter', 'Ju', 'Dou', 'little', 'respect', 'emotionally', 'mentally', 'physically', 'Ju', 'Dou', 'solace', 'affection', 'husband', 'nephew', 'gentle', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'dye', 'mill', 'way', 'escape', 'lot', 'life', 'only', 'partially', 'Ju', 'Dou', 'love', 'young', 'man', 'love', 'impregnation', 'complications', 'eventual', 'tragedy', 'Ju', 'Dou', 'life', 'life', 'was', ""n't"", 'already', 'tragic.As', 'film', 'Ju', 'Dou', 'straight', 'pain', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel', 'here', 'solely', 'emotional', 'devastation', 'Even', 'when', 'things', 'appear', 'brighter', 'Ju', 'Dou', 'relationship', 'young', 'Tianqing', 'obvious', 'things', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'good', 'whole', 'will', 'only', 'have', 'fleeting', 'moments', 'seeming', 'happiness', 'words', 'fleeting', 'seeming', 'continually', 'take', 'over', 'narrative', 'may', 'object', 'such', 'harsh', 'depictions', 'consider', 'strong', 'testament', 'director', 'vision', 'creative', 'control', 'What', 'even', 'grander', 'fact', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'Gong', 'Li', 'Li', 'Baotian', 'Li', 'Wei', 'underscore', 'moment', 'complete', 'understanding', 'characters', 'eventualities', 'feel', 'complete', 'control', 'moments', 'Li', 'Wei', 'effectively', 'evil', 'delving', 'heart', 'monster', 'delivering', 'terrifying', 'performance', 'Boatian', 'broods', 'effectively', 'out', 'pent', 'up', 'frustrations', 'loving', 'woman', 'tied', 'monster', 'Gong', 'Li', 'who', 'ounce', 'film', 'so', 'achingly', 'realistic', 'so', 'honest', 'dripping', 'internal', 'torment', 'Just', 'watching', 'face', 'recoil', 'surroundings', 'deeply', 'assertive', 'performance', 'one', 'soak', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'project', 'burdened', 'eyes.And', 'what', 'colorful', 'set', 'pieces', 'one', 'only', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'did', 'complete', 'justice', 'constrictive', 'yet', 'fluid', 'cinematography', 'Ju', 'Dou', 'visually', 'arresting', 'emotionally.Some', 'have', 'balked', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'as', 'far', 'concerned', 'must', 'agree', 'degree', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'overly', 'offensive', 'have', 'seen', 'worse', 'was', 'expecting', 'much', 'better', 'Still', 'film', 'issues', 'DVD', 'one', 'many', 'films', 'top', 'notch', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'will', 'never', 'receive', 'not', 'popular', 'enough', 'so', 'highly', 'recommend', 'see', 'film', 'way', 'can']",N/A

The VHS copy I saw had no mechanical flaws in it whatsoever.This Chinese movie reminded me a great deal of THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE, set on a medieval silk farm. The owner of the silk cloth business (played by Li Wei) is married to a young girl, Ju Dou (Gong Li), whom he abuses. His young nephew (Li Baotian) works for him, and he and Ju Dou fall in love. They carry on a passionate affair until she becomes pregnant. They deceive Wei by making him think the child is his. They think of killing Wei, but can't go through with it. Then one day Wei has an accident and is paralyzed from the waist down (Baotian could have left him to die, but saves him). The two lovers now openly flaunt their relationship in front of Wei. When the child, a boy, is born, Wei, to save face, accepts him as his own son. But years later the boy learns the truth about who his real father is, and the results are disastrous for the two lovers. The spare and stark story line is interesting, with many unexpected twists and turns to it. The depictions of the medieval cloth dyeing trade are also fascinating to see. Well worth a watch (on VHS).",5,Hypnotic story and visuals,1140912000,"02 26, 2006",2006,1321,"['5', 'stars', 'movie', 'VHS', '0', 'stars', 'DVDI', 'am', 'basing', 'review', 'VHS', 'copy', 'saw', 'rather', 'atrocious', 'DVD', 'version', 'enough', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'how', 'bad', 'THAT', 'VHS', 'copy', 'saw', 'had', 'mechanical', 'flaws', 'Chinese', 'movie', 'reminded', 'great', 'deal', 'THE', 'POSTMAN', 'ALWAYS', 'RINGS', 'TWICE', 'set', 'medieval', 'silk', 'farm', 'owner', 'silk', 'cloth', 'business', 'played', 'Li', 'Wei', 'married', 'young', 'girl', 'Ju', 'Dou', 'Gong', 'Li', 'whom', 'young', 'nephew', 'Li', 'Baotian', 'Ju', 'Dou', 'fall', 'love', 'carry', 'passionate', 'affair', 'pregnant', 'deceive', 'Wei', 'making', 'think', 'child', 'think', 'killing', 'Wei', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'Wei', 'accident', 'paralyzed', 'waist', 'down', 'Baotian', 'could', 'have', 'left', 'die', 'two', 'lovers', 'now', 'openly', 'flaunt', 'relationship', 'front', 'Wei', 'When', 'child', 'boy', 'born', 'Wei', 'save', 'face', 'own', 'son', 'years', 'later', 'boy', 'truth', 'who', 'real', 'father', 'results', 'are', 'disastrous', 'two', 'lovers', 'spare', 'stark', 'story', 'line', 'interesting', 'many', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'depictions', 'medieval', 'cloth', 'dyeing', 'trade', 'are', 'also', 'fascinating', 'see', 'Well', 'watch', 'VHS']",N/A

493262,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,B0000065T4,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[6, 6]","The films of Zhang Yimou are some of the most innovative motion picture experiences today. Yimou uses light and color like few directors of his generation. From my understanding one of the highlights of Ju Dou was the dramatic colors used both literally and symbolically. Unfortunately this does not come through in the Razor release. In this edition the colors are faded and washed out. The transfer is poor. It looks like a copy of an inferior PAL tranfer from VHS.The film moves with the spirit of Greek tragedy. The downfall of the Yang family is told through the story of an illicit affair between the wife of silk dyer Jin Shan Yang, played beautifully by Gong Li and Tianquing (Baotian Li), the dyer's nephew. The affair brings about tragic consequences leading to thedownfall of the Yang business,I wish I could say more but my copy of the DVD froze and would not play in the last two minutes of the film. This is quite possibly one of the worst transfers I have ever experienced. I have seen bootlegs that have been done more professionally. I addition to the poor quality the film is presented in the wrong aspect ratio, the subtitling is laughable, and the actual print looks like it was dragged along a concrete road leading to numerous scratches.I would love to see this film as it should be shown.

493263,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0000065T4,Dennis Littrell,"[43, 49]","The title character, a peasant sold as a concubine to a cruel old man, is played by the beautiful Gong Li, one of the great actresses of our time who followed this brilliant work with spectacular performances in The Story of Qiu Ju (1991), Raise the Red Lantern (1992), and Farewell, My Concubine (1993).  Li Wei plays her master, Yang Jin-shan, the childless owner of a dye mill in the agrarian China of the 1920s.  Li Wei's fine performance combines craftiness with iniquity reminding me a little of the late great John Huston with scruffy beard.  The third character in the tragic triangle is Jin-shan's nephew, Yang Tianqing, a modest man who does most of the work in the dye mill.  The pent-up intensity of Li Baotian, who plays Tianqing, recalled to me at times the work of Ben Kingsley.  Ju Dou falls in love with Tianqing almost by default, and it is their ill-fated love that leads to tragedy.In some ways this visually stunning, psychologically brutal film about paternity and the old social order of China was Director Zhang Yimou's ""practice"" for the making two years later of his masterpiece, the afore mentioned, Raise the Red Lantern, one the greatest films ever made.  The theme of patriarchal privilege is similar, and in both films Gong Li portrays a young concubine required to bear a son and heir to a cruel and ageing man of means.  Even though the setting in both films is China in the twenties before the rise of Communism, both films very much annoyed the ageing leadership of Communist China and were censured (Ju Dou was actually banned), ostensibly for moral reasons, but more obviously because of the way they depicted elderly men in positions of power.Ju Dou is the lesser film only in the sense that Sirius might outshine the sun were the two stars placed side by side.  Both films are masterpieces, but for me Ju Dou was difficult to watch because of the overt cruelty of the master, whereas in Raise the Red Lantern, Yimou chose to keep the more brutal aspects of the story off camera.  In a sense, then, Raise the Red Lantern is the more subtle film.  It is also a film of greater scope involving more characters, infused with an underlining sense of something close to black humor.  (The very lighting of the lanterns was slyly amusing as it ironically pointed to the subjugation.)In Ju Dou there is virtually no humor and the emphasis is on the physical brutality of life under the patriarchal social order.  Ju Dou is beaten and tortured while we learn that Jin-shan tortured his previous wives to death because of their failure to bear him an heir.  The terrible irony is that it is Jin-shan who is sterile.  He feels shamed in the eyes of his ancestors because the Wang line will die out with him.  But a child is finally born through Ju Dou's illicit affair with Tianqing.  (Note that this conjoining in effect saves Ju Dou's life.)  Jin-shan thinks the infant is his son and briefly all is serenity.  However, while two may live happily ever after, three will not.  Notice too that now that Jin-shan has an heir, nephew Tianqing will inherit nothing.Will they kill Jin-shan?  Will fortuitous events put him out of the picture?  Will they find happiness?  Will the boy learn the truth about his paternity?  Yimou's artistry does not allow superficial resolution, you can be sure.Note the two significant turns the film takes early on.  One comes after Ju Dou discovers that Tianqing has been spying on her through a peep hole as she goes about her bath.  At first she is mortified, and then sees this as a chance to show him the scars from the torture she endures daily, and then she shows him her body to allure him.  The other turn comes as the child pronounces his first words by calling the old man ""Daddy.""  Instantly Jin-shan, now confined to a wooden bucket that serves as a wheelchair, divines a deep psychological plan to realize his revenge.  He embraces the child as his own, hoping to turn the boy against the illicit couple.The strength of the film is in the fine acting, the beautiful sets, the gorgeous camera work, and in the unsentimental story that does not compromise or cater to saccharin or simplistic expectations.  Yimou is a visual master who turns the wood gear- and donkey-driven dye mill of the 1920s  into a tapestry of brilliant color and texture.  Notable is the fine work that he does with the two boys who play the son at different ages.  He has them remain virtually mute throughout and almost autistically cold.  Indeed part of the power of this film comes from the depiction of the character of the son who grows up to hate who he is and acts out his hatred in murderous violence toward those around him.Zhang Yimou is one of the few directors who can bring simultaneously to the silver screen the power of an epic and the subtlety of a character study.  His films are more beautiful than the most lavish Hollywood productions and as artistically satisfying as the best in world cinema.  The only weakness in the film is perhaps the ending which is played like a Greek tragedy for cathartic effect.  One senses that Yimou and co-director Yang Fengliang in choosing the terminus were not entirely sure how this tale should end and took what might be seen as an easy way out.--Dennis Littrell, author

493264,A1VMYP2MPF3NB8,B0000065T4,Fabian Wilfred,"[0, 0]","Upon watching this film I've come to discover the cinematic views pushed forward by the director, one that is politically as it is beautifully conveyed. It deals with idealism, skepticism and defiance. Zhang Yimou's bleak past comes across in his perception of modern Chinese life. The dire need to subject a female protagonist in simple Chinese life breaks the generalization that women are secondary in the culture itself.  After awhile we tend to question the films conceptual meaning, behind the closed walls of the governance to the societal values that bridge the struggles of a simple girl, what is her social placement?The metaphor's that is expressed through situations and colors brings profundity to the plot. The Chinese culture has been oppressed for centuries since The Qin Dynasty to the Tang Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty and they have been fighting a losing battle. The confinement of old values lunges at our very own cultural beliefs. We would make the direct mistake of saying that Ju Dou is a story about the tragedy of love; instead it deals with oppression and the blatant patriarchal society that lives to deliver narrow ancestral values that subdues the fundamentals of equality.Comprised of detailed composition and intricate framing Ju Dou is best known for its cinematography an area in which director Zhang Yimou is extremely familiar with. But upon discovering the aesthetically beautiful set, I've come to learn that the contrast of lighting and color sets the pace and feel of the film, triggering emotions and senses that is relatively done on purpose. The manipulation of the settings makes way with the delicate introduction of the costumes and braided colors that intertwine and flow within the context of the plot.Ju Dou defines her self significantly at first as the beautiful bride packaged with purity and innocence, but later poses up as an authoritarian and pushed as far as being a mere mistress, the dual complex characters bridge themselves together with lust, affection and fear not to mention the patriarchal oppression. Yang Jinshan the old cruel miser with an inferiority complex makes an approach that immediately sets his character apart from the others. Comparatively suggesting a ruthless and stronger role, he is dressed with a higher set of clothing than his counterpart signifying authority and money. Yang Tianqing the lower class servant boy displays a forward yet subtle rebellious influence of the social culture; he in many senses signifies metaphorical character of Zhang Yimou himself, dressed down with plain colors Yang Tianqing expresses deviancy as a character by having a lucid affair with Ju Dou.I've decidedly picked several scenes that best make exemplary of the metaphors and compositions of the film, do notice of the vivid scenery that's seemingly juxtaposed with cross cultural interpretation of the oppressed culture.As a point of information the film Ju Dou was adapted from the novel Fuxi, Fuxi, ""In an ancient Chinese myth, Fuxi and N&uuml;wa were blood brother and sister but married in order to produce offsprings for the sake of the continuation of humankind"". A rich form of narrative feature only sources out to implicate the cross-cultural evolution that is functionally oppressed. Zhang Yimou ingeniously employs the deeper symbols, he emphasizes on primitive forms of art and literature, which brings depth to the function of his piece.Watch as the sexual prohibition and desires only end in death, the complexity of the 3 characters bounces off the old values that places women on a secondary platform. The symbols that matches with the situation, for example we were first introduced to white cloth and slowly progresses to multi colored situations later on. The purity of the white experiences innocence, harmony, light, happiness, eroticism and only ends in deaths.The feature never fails to sustain social grounding; it also suggests that the male dominated society is slowly changing by the inclusion of impotency in an authoritative figure.

Bernabo,"[11, 15]","I would hesitate to qualify &quot;Ju Dou&quot; as erotic in the traditional Western sense of the word, but that may just be because the tragedy of this tale overwhelms the sensuality.  The title character, played by Gong Li, is married off to the brutal owner of a dye mill in rural China in the 1920's who treats his wife as badly as he treats his nephew.  In their misery the pair turn to each other and when Ju Dou is pregnant and bears a son, they have to pretend the boy is her husband's.  However, their hidden love is just a tragedy waiting to happen and even the death of the old man does not provide any real happiness.  &quot;Ju Dou&quot; is essentially a horror film, whose middle act happens to be a romance.  But the way the uncle treats his nephew and how the nephew and Ju Dou pay for their love, will stand out in your memory more than the supposedly erotic middle section.I am not sure I am willing to call &quot;Ju Dou&quot; director Yimou Zhang's best film (co-directed by Yang Fengliang), but like all of his films it is fascinating to watch.  It does make the best use of the Technicolor equipment China bought from the U.S., especially as they work on dying all that fabric.  The bright colors are truly spectacular.  Although &quot;Ju Dou&quot; was the first Chinese film to be nominated for the Best Foreign Film Oscar, it was banned in China by the government.  The assumption is because since the film is about an impotent old man ruining the lives of those under him the people would see it as a metaphor for a nation ruled by a bunch of old men.
