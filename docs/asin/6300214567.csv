He gives a performance that is still the best of his career, he is surprisingly...emotional. Near the end, anyway. Witness is a story about many different things, and suceeds in nearly all of them. Young Amish boy Samuel Lapp is the witness to a grisly murder, and immediately becomes crucial to the investigation to find the killers, headed by veteran police officer John Book. It doesn't take Book long to figure out that there's a conspiracy in the Philadelphia Police Department, a conspiracy to sell drugs above the law. Book gets into a gunfight, then skips town to save himself, Samuel and his mother, Rachel, a widow. As the story progresses, John and Rachel become attracted to each other, which leads to lots of tension because of the Amish angle. You wonder if one will abandon their life to join the other. This tension is part of what makes the movie great. There's humor, although a little more would not have been out of line, and there's plenty of excitement when the crooked cops return to silence Book once and for all. Sure, the ending is pretty disappointing, and there are some goofs, like some of the other reviewers have mentioned (I honestly didn't notice them until I looked for them), and this movie has a defininte eighties feel, with those wonderful synthesizers that you remember (or are unable to forget, as is my case), but this is the best film of Ford's career, he was nominated for an Oscar, and he should have won it in my opinion. The DVD, however, offers little, just a commentary by Weir and decent sound and picture. Still, worth buying on its merit alone. I've seen this movie a dozen times, and I think its great.",5,Ford's Best Preformance...A Classic,981849600,"02 11, 2001",2001,1708,"['Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Oscar', 'movie', 'performance', 'still', 'best', 'career', 'surprisingly', 'emotional', 'end', 'anyway', 'Witness', 'story', 'many', 'different', 'things', 'suceeds', 'nearly', 'Amish', 'boy', 'Samuel', 'Lapp', 'witness', 'grisly', 'murder', 'immediately', 'crucial', 'investigation', 'find', 'killers', 'headed', 'veteran', 'police', 'officer', 'John', 'Book', ""n't"", 'take', 'Book', 'long', 'figure', 'out', 'conspiracy', 'Philadelphia', 'Police', 'Department', 'conspiracy', 'sell', 'drugs', 'law', 'Book', 'gunfight', 'then', 'town', 'save', 'Samuel', 'mother', 'Rachel', 'widow', 'story', 'John', 'Rachel', 'become', 'attracted', 'other', 'lots', 'tension', 'Amish', 'angle', 'wonder', 'one', 'will', 'abandon', 'life', 'join', 'other', 'tension', 'part', 'what', 'movie', 'great', 'humor', 'little', 'more', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'line', 'plenty', 'excitement', 'when', 'crooked', 'cops', 'return', 'silence', 'Book', 'once', 'Sure', 'ending', 'pretty', 'disappointing', 'are', 'goofs', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'looked', 'movie', 'defininte', 'eighties', 'feel', 'wonderful', 'synthesizers', 'remember', 'are', 'unable', 'forget', 'case', 'best', 'film', 'Ford', 'career', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'opinion', 'DVD', 'however', 'little', 'just', 'commentary', 'Weir', 'decent', 'sound', 'picture', 'Still', 'worth', 'buying', 'merit', 'alone', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'dozen', 'times', 'think', 'great']",Witness VHS

213603,A1A87TUBBDPMF0,6300214567,"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer""","[8, 8]","If the Star Wars and Indiana Jones trilogies proved Harrison Ford could play cliffhanger-serial style action heroes without breaking a sweat, his performance in 1986's Witness as a Philadelphia detective hiding in an Amish community after discovering some of his fellow cops are on the other side of the law proved that he could play more down-to-Earth, believable and even vulnerable leading man roles.Ford plays John Book, a dedicated if rather world-weary detective captain in the Philadelphia police department who is called in to investigate the brutal slaying of an undercover officer in a public restroom at the train station.  His only witness: eight-year-old Samuel Lapp (Lukas Haas), an Amish boy who's traveling with his beautiful (and recently widowed) mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis).At first, Book and Rachel clash when he insists that Samuel's testimony is badly needed to identify the cop killers, but when the investigation leads to the corrupt Lt. James McFee (Danny Glover) and others in the police force, the young and terrified Amish woman must become Book's protector when he is wounded in a parking lot shootout with McFee and some of his accomplices.  Making their way to Lancaster County in Book's car, Rachel, Samuel and the wounded detective find temporary refuge in the rural and definitely back-to-basics Amish community in the Pennsylvania countryside.Australian director Peter Weir, working from a well-written screenplay by William Kelley and Earl W. Wallace, combines the fish-out-of-water theme of a modern American cop hiding out in a community that shuns his modern, &quot;English&quot; ways with a beautiful love story and a taut mystery thriller.  Weir (Gallipoli, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World) balances all these masterfully, never letting one part of the story overwhelm the other.Ford had tackled the action/romance hybrid genre before, in 1979's forgettable Hanover Street, but his performance in Witness is absolutely wonderful. He is still in an action-hero role of sorts here, but in a more believable setting and definitely more vulnerable than either Han Solo or Indiana Jones.  He's earthy and sometimes profane, yet there is a loneliness and tenderness that comes to the fore when he falls for Rachel...and realizes that his life and hers are universes apart even though they live only a few counties apart.Witness also has a great supporting cast, including Patti Lupone, Josef Sommer, the late Alexander Godunov, Viggo Mortensen (Lord of the Rings), and Beverly May.Also worth mentioning is Maurice Jarre's (The Longest Day) simple yet evocative score that reflects the gentle reverence and simplicity of the Amish community, and underscores the budding love between the tough but wounded detective and the beautiful and lonely widow.",5,"Ford, McGillis shine in this classic romantic thriller....",1075507200,"01 31, 2004",2004,2803,"['Star', 'Wars', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'trilogies', 'proved', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'could', 'play', 'cliffhanger-serial', 'style', 'action', 'heroes', 'breaking', 'sweat', 'performance', '1986', 'Witness', 'Philadelphia', 'detective', 'hiding', 'Amish', 'community', 'discovering', 'fellow', 'cops', 'are', 'other', 'side', 'law', 'proved', 'could', 'play', 'more', 'down-to-Earth', 'believable', 'even', 'vulnerable', 'leading', 'man', 'roles.Ford', 'John', 'Book', 'dedicated', 'rather', 'world-weary', 'detective', 'captain', 'Philadelphia', 'police', 'department', 'who', 'called', 'investigate', 'brutal', 'slaying', 'undercover', 'officer', 'public', 'restroom', 'train', 'station', 'only', 'witness', 'eight-year-old', 'Samuel', 'Lapp', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'Amish', 'boy', 'who', 'traveling', 'beautiful', 'recently', 'widowed', 'mother', 'Rachel', 'Kelly', 'McGillis', '.At', 'first', 'Book', 'Rachel', 'clash', 'when', 'Samuel', 'testimony', 'badly', 'needed', 'identify', 'cop', 'killers', 'when', 'investigation', 'corrupt', 'Lt.', 'James', 'McFee', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'others', 'police', 'force', 'young', 'terrified', 'Amish', 'woman', 'must', 'become', 'Book', 'protector', 'when', 'wounded', 'parking', 'lot', 'shootout', 'McFee', 'accomplices', 'Making', 'way', 'Lancaster', 'County', 'Book', 'car', 'Rachel', 'Samuel', 'wounded', 'detective', 'find', 'temporary', 'refuge', 'rural', 'definitely', 'back-to-basics', 'Amish', 'community', 'Pennsylvania', 'countryside.Australian', 'director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'working', 'well-written', 'screenplay', 'William', 'Kelley', 'Earl', 'W.', 'Wallace', 'fish-out-of-water', 'theme', 'modern', 'American', 'cop', 'hiding', 'out', 'community', 'modern', 'quot', 'English', 'quot', 'ways', 'beautiful', 'love', 'story', 'taut', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'Weir', 'Gallipoli', 'Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'masterfully', 'never', 'letting', 'one', 'part', 'story', 'other.Ford', 'had', 'tackled', 'action/romance', 'hybrid', 'genre', '1979', 'forgettable', 'Hanover', 'Street', 'performance', 'Witness', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'still', 'action-hero', 'role', 'sorts', 'here', 'more', 'believable', 'setting', 'definitely', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'Han', 'Solo', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'earthy', 'sometimes', 'profane', 'yet', 'loneliness', 'tenderness', 'fore', 'when', 'Rachel', 'life', 'hers', 'are', 'universes', 'apart', 'even', 'live', 'only', 'few', 'counties', 'apart.Witness', 'also', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Patti', 'Lupone', 'Josef', 'Sommer', 'late', 'Alexander', 'Godunov', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Beverly', 'May.Also', 'mentioning', 'Maurice', 'Jarre', 'Longest', 'Day', 'simple', 'yet', 'evocative', 'score', 'gentle', 'reverence', 'simplicity', 'Amish', 'community', 'budding', 'love', 'tough', 'wounded', 'detective', 'beautiful', 'lonely', 'widow']",Witness VHS

The plot is so unique - a young window with a small son, living in the Amish country, harbor an inner-city police officer in order to solve a crime. Add a bit of romance (Kelly McGillis and Harrison Ford have delightful, downplayed chemistry) and you have a movie bound to please everybody. There's a little action, a little drama, a little romance, and a little suspense. Elements that, when put together, make this a truly wonderful film.What I liked best was the portrayal of the Amish. Instead of painting them as quaint, sheltered people, the movie concentrates on their values and their mindset. The end result leaves the viewer with a strong feeling that maybe they've been living life the right way, and we've somehow gone astray.The supporting characters (a viscious Danny Glover, small and innocent Samuel, and the old and wise - if a bit stubborn - Eli) are perfect, and lend the movie a almost homey feeling. With the exeption of the villains, most are three dimensional and complex, and play an important role in the story instead of merely being a distraction.I've never seen two stars more perfectly cast than Harrison and Kelly.

They are presented as a quiet people, so McGillis has the difficult task of making Rachel speak without dialogue, and she does it well, which carries over to Ford (he got an Oscar nomination, she didn't).It's only at the climax of the film, when the action takes over that the film begins to weaken.

I hadn't seen it at the theater so I was impressed when I saw it on TV the first time and sorry I had missed it on the big screen. Eventually she replaced her VHS with DVD and so I never bought a copy since I could borrow hers. I'm not waiting any longer to get my own copy with this edition at such an incredible price. Ford, Haas, McGillis, and the rest the cast are exceptional in this movie. The story, acting, sets, music and directing are above most movies and the majority of people will see that clearly. Imagine a young boy witnessing a murder of a police officer and then being pursued by unknown forces. A detective, played by Ford, assigned to his case finds they have opened a can of worms. There is a distinct smell of police corruption as they are pursued by other officers. The beautiful scenes like the barn raising in the Amish community are great with a real feel of their culture and life. Excellent quality DVD with tons of extras. Excellent replayability. I also recommend getting Amazon Prime if you buy much at Amazon since it will more than pay you back not only in shipping costs but delivery time too.

(There's one very brief scene of Kelly McGillis in her petticoat skirt with breasts bared, but it doesn't seem to have any real erotic overtones to me.)  Rachel Lapp (McGillis) is a young Amish widow from Lancaster County who is taking her son Samuel (Lukas Haas) to visit her pregnant sister in Baltimore when, waiting for their connection in the Philadelphia railroad station, the boy inadvertantly sees a man murdered in the men's room and gets a good look at one of the killers.  Homicide detective John Book (Harrison Ford) is assigned to the case and is surprised but not, on second thought, overly so when Samuel fingers narco cop McFee (Danny Glover).  His mistake turns out to be telling his superior, Capt. Schaeffer (Josef Sommer), who turns out to be just as dirty as McFee.  Attacked in a parking garage, Book realizes that he has to get the Lapps out of Philadelphia if they're to have any hope of survival.  But the wound he suffers forces him to take refuge in the house of Rachel's father-in-law, Eli (Jan Rubes), where as time goes by he begins to understand that Samuel isn't the only witness in this affair: Book himself is becoming one to the quiet joys and satisfactions of the Amish way of life--and a mutual attraction is growing between him and Rachel.  Meanwhile, time is growing short as Schaeffer discovers where Book and the Lapps are hiding.This suspenseful thriller is one of the best (and most popular) of Ford's mid-career work, and he does a very good job as a jaded plainclothesman suddenly exposed to beliefs and lifestyles he's never known before.

213626,AEMZRE6QYVQBS,6300214567,David A. Baer,"[2, 2]","Harrison Ford shines in this lingering over the close-quarter differences between Pennsylvania's Amish people and the 'English' life that by contrast seems so rude in this 1985 screen gem. Yet twenty-two years later, it is the young Kelly McGillis who nearly melts the screen with this early performance as Rachel, the Amish widow who takes in Harrison's 'John Book' and grows into love with a fugitive from 'the city' whose own heart grows entwined with the Amish way.Although the Amish did not like this film (it *is* a film), it remains as a deeply moving tribute to their chosen, peaceful way. Perhaps it is the finest thing we 'English'--this reviewer grew up in Pennsylvania with the Amish as his neighbors--can offer them.Not that they were asking for recognition.Director Peter Weir caught them doing what they do best, going about the business of keeping peace and making the earth grow its greenest things. The occasional caricature that creeps in clumsily elevates the men and women it seeks to honor rather than reducing them to its dimensional poverty.The Amish are not heroes and do not play that role particularly well on the wide screen (the actors of are course not Amish men and women). They are rather people who have from within community made a stark choice and chosen to celebrate both its limitations and the world it opens up to them.Weir, Ford, McGinnis et al. did well to freeze-frame that choice as one that saved the life of a self-sufficient Baltimore policemen who stumbled upon corruption that made him a marked man in the city. It is a most moving still.The film was uncanny in its capacity, in the end, to mark the Amish off in the most authentic way: not by sneering at their simplicity of style and rejection of 'fashion'. Rather, as recent history has provided grim occasion for us to observe, the Amish are distinguished by the grace that they do not kill.

""Witness"" (1985 Paramount) is a brilliant telling of the old order Amish story, and a brilliant picturization of those people and their lives, habitat.It's sort of a documentary done by Hollywood's best technical people....nothing touches it.It was nominated for Best Picture Academy Award and got beat out by trendy ""Wall Street"" starring Michael Douglas in the Reagan years when Hollywood Democrats fired movies aimed at heartless (probably Republican!) businessmen like Gorden Gekko, played by Michael Douglas.But ""Witness"" (1985 Paramount), a quieter, simpler, non-big city movie was nominated, too........and deserved to be.It's a classic all should see, including the old order Amish, who never get to see it due to the rules about no TV's, movies, etc. part of their culture and lives.Oh, well....nobody's perfect, including them!----------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG-AFTRA movie actor",5,"""Witness"" (1985 Paramount) is the most important fiction movie ever made which depicts Old Order Amish persons in Pennsylcania",1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,2048,"['Witness', '1985', 'Paramount', 'starring', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'most', 'important', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'set', 'Lancaster', 'County', 'Pennsylvania', 'old', 'order', 'Amish', 'country', 'telling', 'story', 'thriller', 'movie', 'Philadelphia', 'PA', 'police', 'detective', 'Ford', 'lam', 'Amish', 'country', 'being', 'hidden', 'old', 'order', 'Amish', 'types', 'large', 'Lancaster', 'County', 'PA', 'farm.We', 'get', 'see', 'old', 'order', 'Amish', 'life', 'movie', 'sense', 'movie', 'quasi', 'documentary', 'interesting', 'seldom', 'treated', 'subject', 'USA', 'life', 'old', 'order', 'Amish', 'Lancaster', 'County', 'PA', 'how', 'live', 'get', 'treated', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', ""n't"", 'agree', 'them.I', 'live', 'Lancaster', 'County', 'Pennsylvania', 'Columbia', 'PA', 'Lancaster', 'City', 'PA', 'watch', 'old', 'order', 'Amish', 'show', 'area', '..they', 'work', 'Columbia', 'Market', 'enclosed', 'large', 'brick', '19th', 'century', 'restored', 'building', '5,000', 'person', 'town', 'Columbia', 'PA', 'USA', 'located', 'exactly', 'Susquehanna', 'River', 'where', 'US', 'Route', '30', 'Lincoln', 'Highway', 'river', 'way', 'Oregon', 'West', 'Coast.The', 'Amish', 'show', 'here', 'Lancaster', 'County', 'PA', 'quite', 'show', 'food', 'thought', 'Witness', '1985', 'Paramount', 'brilliant', 'telling', 'old', 'order', 'Amish', 'story', 'brilliant', 'picturization', 'people', 'lives', 'habitat.It', 'sort', 'documentary', 'done', 'Hollywood', 'best', 'technical', 'people', '.nothing', 'touches', 'it.It', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Academy', 'Award', 'got', 'beat', 'out', 'trendy', 'Wall', 'Street', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Reagan', 'years', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'Democrats', 'fired', 'movies', 'aimed', 'heartless', 'probably', 'Republican', 'businessmen', 'Gorden', 'Gekko', 'played', 'Michael', 'Douglas.But', 'Witness', '1985', 'Paramount', 'quieter', 'simpler', 'non-big', 'city', 'movie', 'was', 'nominated', 'too', '..and', 'deserved', 'be.It', 'classic', 'should', 'see', 'including', 'old', 'order', 'Amish', 'who', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'due', 'rules', 'TV', 'movies', 'etc', 'part', 'culture', 'lives.Oh', 'well', '.nobody', 'perfect', 'including', 'Written', 'Tex', 'Allen', 'SAG-AFTRA', 'movie', 'actor']",Witness VHS

Harrison Ford is better than I have ever seen him; the scenes with eight-year-old Lukas Haas are magical, and Kelly McGillis  projects the primeval power of a woman like few you'll ever see.  Peter  Weir's direction is practically flawless.  The evil cops are as evil as  evil can be, and the Amish are treated kindly, with respect and admiration.  Quite simply though, the reason this is a great thriller is that it is a  powerful love story.The passionate love that is felt and built upon, but  not consummated, envelops the audience in anticipation.  What makes this  happen is some real-not contrived-obstacle to the expression of that love,  such as the lovers being from different and warring families, as in ""Romeo  and Juliet,"" or from different cultures, as here in ""Witness.""  She is  Amish, and he is a big city cop who ""whacks"" people.  For their love to  work, a gulf as wide as the Pacific Ocean has to be bridged.

For those who haven't seen this movie, other reviewers have spelled out the plot very nicely.The heart of the story is the  juxtaposition of the hardened, big city detective in the midst of Amish  country, and it centers on his relationship with a young, beautiful Amish  woman and her son.  Exteme opposites that do, indeed, attract.  The sparks  fly between them and keeps the viewer captivated (at least it did for me).  Kelly McGillis played an exceptional role in this film (her first film, I  believe).  I'd rate it as her best performance by a long shot.  It was also  one of Harrison Ford's better roles.  And Lukas Haas was very convincing in  all but one scene.The cinematography and Jarre's music was lovingly  layered, and displayed throughout the Pennsylvania local.  The barn raising  scene was especially wonderful, and gives the viewer a true yearning for a  simpler, more family-oriented life.Not everything worked in this  picture, however.  In a couple of places the editing seemed haphazardly  done.  The scene where the cops are on the front porch of Ford's sister and  questioning her is an example (the voice-over didn't work at all).  Also,  the scene at the end when Sommer is leading Ford and McGillis out from the  barn, you could almost sense the director calling ""action"" and the scene  beginning.  Pretty disturbing for this caliber of film.  Another minor  annoyance was when Danny Glover, after being shot, raises the shotgun  toward the ceiling with one hand and pulls the trigger.  There was  absolutely no recoil.  I don't have a clue why this scene wasn't redone.  Anyone who knows anything about firearms will shake their heads.  Finally,  and more importantly, the `bad' cops just weren't convincing as real  people...ala...human flesh and blood.  They seemed to be punched out from  the standard Hollywood cookie-cutter.That's a lot of stuff not to like  in one of my favorite films (I also have several more minor items that I  didn't mention).  But I forgave these transgressions to my suspension of  disbelief, and ended up really enjoying this film.  I haul it out every so  often just to be transported to another world and watch a great love story  done to perfection (no melodramatic ""smaltz"" here).

Overall, Witness is an entertaining movie and a well-done combination of a love story and a thriller. Additionally, it does an excellent job of making a contrast between the innocence and simplicity of Amish life and the grime and violence of the city. In fact, if anything, the movie's only fault is that it exaggerates the contrast and paints the city too darkly.In Witness, Samuel (Lukas Haas in a very impressive performance), a young Amish boy, witnesses a murder in the mens' room of a train station on his first trip to Philadelphia. When the boy and his beautiful mother, Rachel (Kelly McGillis), speak to the police about the matter, police chief John Book (Harrison Ford) explains that, because the boy was a material witness to a homicide, the law demands that he stay and help identify the killer. When he does, however, Book realizes they are in danger and, even after being shot badly, drives the boy and his mother all the way to their farm before collapsing.

213641,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,6300214567,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[3, 3]","This film leaves a tremendous impact on the viewer ... there is a creative story line, complex plot and deep characters. Often  a look and silence conveys more meaning than words ever could ... The camera is used to maximum effect to capture emotions that are too difficult to state in words. The enormous impact of the discovery made by John Book (Harrison Ford), the Philadephia detective who investigates a murder that occured in a public bathroom ... leads him to become a fugitive from the very law enforcement officers with whom he served. He escapes to Pennsylvania Amish country where the primary witness, a young Amish boy and his mother live. By traveling with Samuel (Lukas Haas) and his mother, Rachel Lapp (Kelly McGillis) ... John Book can protect both himself and Samuel until he can plan his next move to fight for justice ...What leads him to forsake his primary investigation was a discovery that one of the narcotics officers, Lt. James McFee (Danny Glover) is ""unclean"". He made a pact with the devil, sold confiscated drugs on the side from evidence that was never reported ... earned millions of dollars illegally. Not long after John Book reports his suspicions to his superior along with the location of the primary witness to the crime - he learns his superior is on the take and one of the ""bad guys"". This begins his life as a fugitive ... now he is a marked man.There are numerous outstanding scenes, cinematography and lines within the film. Some of them are ... in the police station when Samuel is reviewing mug shots to identify the murderer, he makes eye contact with a female police detective. While John Book receives a phone call, Samuel wanders around the office to explore his environment ... the female officer offers him a cookie, he declines politely. He walks to a glass enclosed case of trophies and awards ... his face registers recognition which John Book notices. John walks to the glass case as Samuel silently points to the face of Lt. James McFee, Narcotics Investigative ""award-winning"" Officer. Another highly moving scene is when Samuel opens a drawer, discovers John Book's loaded gun and holds it ... John finds him, takes the bullets out and explains how dangerous holding a loaded gun is, it can kill. Eli comes in and leads Samuel out of the room ... Eli sits Samuel on his knee and explains, how guns kill people and the Amish believe only G-d can take a human life. Eli asks Samuel what he thinks  to which Samuel sagely replies, ""the gun also kills bad people"", which flies against the teaching he just received ... At times the camera falls in love with Rachel Lapp (Kelly McGillis) whose huge eyes and beauty are enhanced by the stark simplicity of the dark clothing and white lace cap. In another winning moment, John Book is dressed in the plain clothes of his Amish hosts and rides into town with Eli in a horse and buggy. Several teenagers goad and poke fun at an Amish young man. They mock him by touching an ice cream cone to his forehead, both cheeks, and chin. John can not hold himself back ... despite Eli's warning, ""don't John, it is not our way."" John warns the punk, to stop, who replies, ""why what are you going to do?"" John punches him with full force in the stomach and face ... causing bruises and a bloody nose. A elderly non-Amish bystander shakes his head in disbelief but instead of understanding and supporting John's position, he states, ""this will not be good for tourism"". He reports the incident to a policeman which begins the final phase of the film where the Philadephia crooked police learn of John's exact location and they hunt him down ... The Amish young man who was mocked, sheepishly replies to the surrounding crowd, ""He is my cousin from Ohio, they are different from us."" After a house is built by the community, John Book participates demonstrating his carpentry skills, as the men and women of the Amish community exchange expressive looks and voice their suspicions amongst themselves about his relationship with Rachel. Eli (Rachel's father) suggests she may be ""banned"" by the community for her suspicious behavior. In yet another moving scene, John is in the backyard sitting on a bench ... he stares in the window ... to discover Rachel is undressing and about to take a bath. He does not move ... the camera captures Rachel's bare shoulder, her toes, foot, and length of her thigh ... John walks up to the window and states something to the effect, if I were to make love to you tonight, they would never forgive us. He leaves ... Another effective scene was in the kitchen when Rachel sees Samuel playing with a complex wooden toy made of pulleys, slides, and gears ... it was built by John Book for Samuel.Overall, this film has a deep story which is enhanced by the contrast of two opposite cultures. It has superb use of cinematography, the highest caliber of actors and actresses who play their roles to perfection, and creative twists in the plot which are expanded by silence at the most extraordinairy times in the film ... creating enormously powerful scenes via artistic use of cinematography. This is a most highly satisfying viewing experience.Erika Borsos (erikab93)",5,The Law Has Been Compromised  - Yet - Justice Prevails,1114387200,"04 25, 2005",2005,5189,"['film', 'tremendous',

213645,AY12DBB0U420B,6300214567,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","My bargain-rack movie for last night was ""Witness"" starring Harrison Ford. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. It was a good movie, and quite interesting too. Ford played a Philadelphia narcotics detective who was called in to investigate a train-station murder of a second narcotics officer in a restroom at the station. It turned out that there was a witness, a young (about 5) Amish boy hiding in one of the stalls and not detected by the killer because the boy was standing on the toilet when the killer looked under the doors of the stalls. Ford then took the boy and his mother to the police station and detained them from going on their planned trip to Baltimore. The boy viewed several line-ups and a number of mug-shot photos but could not identify the killer. However, in looking around the Philadelphia police station, the boy spotted a large photo on the wall and said that man was the killer. It was a third narcotics officer. Well, Ford immediately went to his superior with the startling news of the positive identification. That, it turned out, was a bad mistake in that the Superior Officer was also in on the killing plan and now Ford, and his partner, were also in danger of losing their lives as well as the young boy. The whole situation was a corrupt quagmire and Ford, the mother and the boy had to escape and they returned to the family's home in the Amish part of Pennsylvania until the FBI might be able to sort things out. Nobody knew where they were until late in the movie.Okay, in terms of the crime/murder story, it was a somewhat routine mystery movie and was well done. What really makes the film stand out is that about 3/4 of the movie was shot in Amish country and probably using an abundance of the Amish people as ""supporting actors"" in the movie. Actually most of them weren't acting at all, they were just the local people going about  their daily lives. It was an extremely interesting backdrop. This area is, after all, one of the most unique cultural areas of the United States. The movie was exceptional in this respect and you felt as if you were actually there in Amish country. That, in my opinion takes a four-star movie and lifts it to five stars.

Rarely has the combination of pure unadulterated beauty and rough and rugged good looks combined in such a winning fashion.  Kelly McGillis is absolutely radiant as the Amish widow  and mother so attracted to Harrison Ford's rough-as-a-cob Philadelphia  detective.  This is one of Ford's best movies ever, and the subtle humor  and constant frustration that he displays with the &quot;lost world&quot;  into which he has plunged is amazing to watch.  And as good as the  principal actors/actresses are, Jan Rubes as grandfatherly Eli Lapp  absolutely steals every scene that he is in--he's outstanding!  His  &quot;gun of the hand&quot; scene with young Lukas Haas where he tries in  vain to explain to his young grandson just what is wrong with and about the  world that exists outside of their own is a real education into Amish  beliefs, and is beautifully done. And watch for one of the most incredible  scenes ever filmed--Lukas Haas's discovery, in the most unlikely of all  places, of the murderer.  This segment was filmed only to music and the  resulting facial reactions, and the accompanying horror felt by both Haas  and Ford are masterfully done.  Adoringly filmed and beautifully scored,  this is one of those films that needs repeat viewings just to catch all of  the little nuances that populate it from beginning to end.

In 'Witness', Ford is police detective John Book, called to interrogate a terrified little Amish boy named Samuel Lapp, and his young widowed mother. An undercover cop has been killed in the men's room at the railroad station, and Samuel, hiding in a stall, is the only eyewitness. Samuel is unable to identify the perp from the usual log of suspects; but there he is, posted prominently on the precinct bulletin board -- a decorated narcotics agent. When Book relates his findings to the police captain, he ends up getting shot himself -- seems the captain is in on it as well. With the captain, the narcotics agent, and a third dirty cop gunning for him, Book needs a place to hide, and what better place than the Lapp house deep in Amish country?The contrast between the gritty urban police precinct and the bucolic Amish farm country is one of the best things about the film. Book dressed in a blue shirt and black trousers several inches too short for him, looking like the proverbial fish out of the water, is a sight to behold. All of a sudden he's back in the nineteenth century -- no electricity, no cars, no TV or computers. He might as well be on another planet. And the Amish are as different from him as space aliens; gentle, quiet pacifists, hardworking and industrious, intent on keeping the outside world as far from them as possible. They are neighborly and cooperative; the barn-raising scene is inspiring to watch. We feel sympathy for these quiet, decent people as the outside world keeps encroaching, and see them trying to navigate a horse and buggy on the Interstate. Book has to try to fit into this world, and he gives it his best shot. He joins in the barn-raising, does odd chores around the farm. But the Amish, while they respect his abilities, hold him at arm's length. For one thing, he's falling in love with the young widow Lapp, whose feeling for him is mutual. For another, his assimilation is only skin-deep; on a trip into town, when a group of local louts start pestering the Amish, Book chips in with a right to the lout's nose that leaves his face a bloody mess. It's going to prove his undoing; back in his precinct, the narcotics agent and the captain have gotten wind of his hideout, and now they come to shut him up once and for all, and silence Samuel as well.In contrast to his one-note performances in the 'Star Wars' films and as Indiana Jones, Ford gives a much more nuanced performance in this film; he's the tough city cop on the one hand and the refugee who doesn't fit on on the other. Lukas Haas is very effective as the young boy Samuel, all big eyes and ears; and Kelly McGillis is excellent as his mother, torn between her feelings for Book and her ties to her Amish community; faced with the threat of being shunned for the rest of her life and cut off from everyone she knows if she marries him. There are several notable supporting performances as well, especially the late Alexander Godunov as the widow Lapp's admirer whose innate civility prevents him from expressing the resentment he feels at Books presence, and Danny Glover as the murderous narcotics detective. Peter Weir's sensitive direction plays up the contrast between time and place, sustaining the tension throughout the film. 'Witness' is not an action/adventure blockbuster like the movies that made Ford a household name, but it doesn't need pyrotechnics to stand out. It's a well-crafted, well-acted, eminently satisfying movie.",4,Harrison Ford shines in a well-crafted film,1090713600,"07 25, 2004",2004,3667,"[""'Witness"", 'probably', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'best', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'showed', 'facet', 'gifted', 'actor', 'who', 'then', 'had', 'been', 'known', 'only', 'most', 'moviegoers', 'only', 'Han', 'Solo', 'Indiana', 'Jones', ""'Witness"", 'Ford', 'police', 'detective', 'John', 'Book', 'called', 'interrogate', 'terrified', 'little', 'Amish', 'boy', 'named', 'Samuel', 'Lapp', 'young', 'widowed', 'mother', 'undercover', 'cop', 'been', 'killed', 'men', 'room', 'railroad', 'station', 'Samuel', 'hiding', 'stall', 'only', 'eyewitness', 'Samuel', 'unable', 'identify', 'perp', 'usual', 'log', 'suspects', 'posted', 'prominently', 'precinct', 'bulletin', 'board', 'decorated', 'narcotics', 'agent', 'When', 'Book', 'findings', 'police', 'captain', 'up', 'getting', 'shot', 'captain', 'as', 'well', 'captain', 'narcotics', 'agent', 'third', 'dirty', 'cop', 'gunning', 'Book', 'place', 'hide', 'what', 'better', 'place', 'Lapp', 'house', 'deep', 'Amish', 'country', 'contrast', 'gritty', 'urban', 'police', 'precinct', 'bucolic', 'Amish', 'farm', 'country', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'film', 'Book', 'dressed', 'blue', 'shirt', 'black', 'trousers', 'several', 'inches', 'too', 'short', 'looking', 'proverbial', 'fish', 'water', 'sight', 'behold', 'sudden', 'back', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'electricity', 'cars', 'TV', 'computers', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'planet', 'Amish', 'are', 'different', 'space', 'aliens', 'gentle', 'quiet', 'pacifists', 'hardworking', 'industrious', 'intent', 'keeping', 'outside', 'world', 'far', 'possible', 'are', 'neighborly', 'cooperative', 'barn-raising', 'scene', 'inspiring', 'watch', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'quiet', 'decent', 'people', 'outside', 'world', 'encroaching', 'see', 'trying', 'navigate', 'horse', 'buggy', 'Interstate', 'Book', 'try', 'fit', 'world', 'best', 'shot', 'barn-raising', 'odd', 'chores', 'farm', 'Amish', 'respect', 'abilities', 'hold', 'arm', 'length', 'one', 'thing', 'falling', 'love', 'young', 'widow', 'Lapp', 'feeling', 'mutual', 'assimilation', 'only', 'skin-deep', 'trip', 'town', 'when', 'group', 'local', 'louts', 'start', 'pestering', 'Amish', 'Book', 'chips', 'right', 'lout', 'nose', 'face', 'bloody', 'mess', 'going', 'prove', 'undoing', 'back', 'precinct', 'narcotics', 'agent', 'captain', 'have', 'gotten', 'wind', 'hideout', 'now', 'come', 'shut', 'up', 'once', 'silence', 'Samuel', 'well.In', 'contrast', 'one-note', 'performances', ""'Star"", 'Wars', 'films', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Ford', 'much', 'more', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'film', 'tough', 'city', 'cop', 'one', 'hand', 'refugee', 'who', ""n't"", 'fit', 'other', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'very', 'effective', 'young', 'boy', 'Samuel', 'big', 'eyes', 'ears', 'Kelly', 'McGillis', 'excellent', 'mother', 'torn', 'feelings', 'Book', 'ties', 'Amish', 'community', 'faced', 'threat', 'being', 'shunned', 'rest', 'life', 'cut', 'off', 'everyone', 'are', 'several', 'notable', 'supporting', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'late', 'Alexander', 'Godunov', 'widow', 'Lapp', 'admirer', 'innate', 'civility', 'prevents', 'expressing', 'resentment', 'Books', 'presence', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'murderous', 'narcotics', 'detective', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'sensitive', 'direction', 'up', 'contrast', 'time', 'place', 'sustaining', 'tension', 'film', 'not', 'action/adventure', 'blockbuster', 'movies', 'made', 'Ford', 'household', 'name', ""n't"", 'need', 'pyrotechnics', 'stand', 'out', 'well-crafted', 'well-acted', 'eminently', 'satisfying', 'movie']",Witness VHS
213670,A20Z1PKIH0PFUF,6300214567,JoeyD,"[1, 1]","A young Amish boy (Samuel Lapp played beautifully in his film debut by Lukas Haas) while traveling with his mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis) witnesses a murder.  The Philly detective assigned to the case is John Bock (Harrison Ford), a cynical, hardened, yet very ethical man who is married to his job.  The murder turns out to be an inside job performed by Bock's associates on the police force.  The three of them soon escape to the Amish community to avoid being the next victims and soon... well, that's what you need to find out when you watch this fine film.This is an excellent film any way you slice it.  Great acting, writing, directing, musical score, etc...  It is my favorite film by director Peter Weir and in my opinion the best performance of Ford's career.  It's a nice change of pace to see Ford actually come down to Earth and play a common man instead of the super-hero he so often portrays. He had quite an amazing run of very successful films in the 80's and 90's but it's very difficult at times to take him too seriously as a dramatic actor despite the money making machines a great many of his films turned out becoming.  Yet he's fantastic as John Book!  He is so much more accessible and unguarded, and it's beautiful to watch.  The man truly can act!  Anyway, it's a shame he hasn't played more parts like this one (see ""The Mosquito Coast"" and ""Frantic"" for two other excellent examples).I have to be quite honest and finally get this off of my chest - I have never thought Kelly McGillis could act!  This is her best performance, and yet, I don't think she is all that convincing as an Amish woman.  Her performance, for me, is the only real flaw in this film (not enough to dock a star though!) She is so stiff and unimpassioned, and I'm not sure if she was trying to speak with an Amish accent or not, but if she was, heaven help her.  The three or four other films I have seen her in, before she descended into being a B-movie star or Lifetime Television regular, she pretty much played the same wooden, passionless character.  Somebody tell me I am wrong or being too harsh.  I apologize to all of you Kelly McG fans out there!The film also had some very fine performances in supporting roles.  Lukas Haas as the young Amish boy is excellent and very believable.  You kind of knew that the kid would go on to bigger and better things if he stayed clean.  Danny Glover is solid as always as one of the rogue cops out to get Book and the boy.  Viggo Mortensen also gets his career up and running with a small role as an amish man named Moses and does an excellent job.  As do Patti Lupone, Josef Summer, Brent Jennings, and Jan Rubes.  Rubes in particular is amazing as Eli Lapp, (Samuel's grandfather and Rachel's father-in-law).  I think this man deserved a best-supporting nod, he was that great.Finally, the story itself is truly terrific.  It's a film that both men and women of any age will enjoy.  It's part love story, part crime drama, part character study, and also part cultural study as well.  Yes, I know, I know, the Amish were pissed off about how they were portrayed in this film.  Yet, I can't figure out why.  To me, they were portrayed to be much more benevolent, kind-hearted, level-headed, and practical than we 'English'.  There were several buddies of mine that wanted to become Amish after seeing this film.  However, me thinks these converts-to-be were enticed more by the beauty of McGillis (especially one scene in particular) than they were by the hard-working, extremely moral, plain folk.  Go figure.In a relatively weak decade when it came to classic films, I would without a doubt put this one on my top-ten best film list for the 1980's.

Bernabo,"[3, 3]","Harrison Ford received his only Oscar nomination for this 1985 film in which a young Amish boy (Lukas Haas) witnesses a murder in Philadelphia while traveling with his mother, Rachel (Kelly McGillis).  When it becomes clear the bad guys are gunning for the boy, and that they include people in his own department, John Book (Ford) flees with them back to their home.  There the big city cop has to come to terms with not only the new culture in which he is immersed, but also his feelings for the young widow.Director Peter Weir captures the beauty and dignity of Amish life.  By the time violence intrudes into this world we are prepared to see it as being a blight upon a peaceful community.  Of course, it intrudes upon the possibility of love between the two main characters, but we knew the odds were against this pair as soon as we saw their worlds collide.  Ford's performance is clearly the best of his career and perhaps touches closest to the actor's dark side.  McGillis is equally restrained as the woman who ends up symbolizing so much to John Book, and the film includes one of the few instances in modern cinema where nudity can truly be said to be romantic.Most Romantic Line:  (1) ""If we'd made love last night I'd have to stay.

When the boy makes an ID that implicates a respected fellow police detective, Book gets wounded, but realizes that he must get the boy and his widowed mother (Kelly McGillis) back to the Amish country and go underground. Thus, much of the movie concerns itself with the fish out of water experience he has, trying to pass as an Amish man, learning about their life and falling in love with the boy's mother. This is dangerous territory for her, as her father-in-law warns her that if she steps out of line, she will be shunned by her community. And then of course, the corrupt police have been looking for Book and the boy, remember. Final showdown is about as you would expect it, and glad to have it so. One interesting note is the pretty good performance by Alexander Godonoff, the defected ballet dancer, as a jealous suitor of Kelly McGillis.

213684,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6300214567,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[4, 5]","""Witness"" is a unique movie in many ways.  It is an action-adventure, and yet it is not.  It is a semi-documentary, and yet it is not.  It is a murder-mystery, and yet it is not.  I struggled with what to call this movie, and found it impossible to classify it because it has so many features.  One of the best features is the excellent and reasonably accurate portrayal of the Amish.Samuel Lapp (Lukas Haas, who in 1988 would have another important role in ""Lady in White"") and his widowed mother Rachel Lapp (Kelly McGillis) are traveling by train to visit her sister in Baltimore.  While waiting for a delayed train, Samuel witnesses the murder of a police officer in the train station rest room, though we do not learn until later that the murdered man was a police officer.The officer assigned to the murder is Detective John Book, in one of his best roles.  Book takes Samuel and Rachel to the police station to see if Samuel can identify the murderer in one of the mug shot books.  What Samuel identifies instead is a picture of a highly decorated police officer, Detective Lieutenant James McFee (Danny Glover).  Book is immediately afraid because he has no idea who else in the police department might be corrupted.  At first he takes Samuel to his sister's house.  However, when Book realizes that Chief Paul Schaeffer (Josef Sommer) is part of a conspiracy with McFee, he immediately takes Samuel and Rachel back to Eli Lapp's (Jan Rubes) farm, but not before being shot in an encounter with McFee.Once Book is on Lapp's farm the movie takes on a completely different character.  Book soon realizes that the Amish are very different from the English, as the Amish call outsiders, in very fundamental ways.  In a bit of irony and perhaps inside humor, Book also demonstrates a substantial woodworking skill.  Harrison Ford was once a carpenter before hitting it big in the movies.Eventually Schaeffer, McFee, and Detective Fergie (Angus MacInnes) trace Book to Lapp's farm, and the stage is set for a show down.  This portion of the movie is relatively short, but intense.  Part of what the director did was to contrast the relatively staid life of the Amish with the action that takes place between these four men, which heightens that action.This story has much depth.  There is chemistry between Book and Rachel, and at one point Rachel subtly offers herself to Book.  However, Book realizes, perhaps more than Rachel, that he is not Amish, and probably never could be.  The contrast between Book and the Amish is provided in several scenes on Lapp's farm, including one with a gun and one where Book refuses to accept the treatment of the Amish by a local punk.I thought the end of this movie was powerful, which I will reveal but minimally.  Book's departure from the Lapp farm heralds the separation of the Amish world and the English world once more, with a return to what each culture knew so well.  We want the ending to be different, but it can not be.Another notable aspect of this movie is the music.  The music in the city is dramatic, and yet eerie when there are moments of realization.  The music on the Lapp farm is generally pastoral and fitting for the relatively simple life the Amish lead.  The more dramatic music during the final battle becomes even more dramatic in contrast to the music that exemplifies the Lapp farm.  The music is very important to the affect the director was trying to achieve.This movie is excellent.  I would usually classify this type of movie as a character study, but in this case it is more the study of the contrast between the Amish and the world around them.

In fact, looking back now from 35 years after the first Star Wars movie, witness is my pick for Harrison Ford's best performance ever. At this time in his career, only a few years after the last Star Wars trilogy movie was made, that was almost all he had done until Witness. In a startlingly nuanced and sensitive performance it's hard to imagine that you're even seeing the same guy who played the macho, devil-may-care Han Solo. McGillis is also great and up till then she had only appeared in a one or two movies, and mainly a TV serial, if I remember right.The drama and tension builds in the clash and contrast between the two cultures. Despite himself, Ford is drawn into the Amish way of life even as he runs from the corrupt cops who are chasing him. The Amish way of life is portrayed well, I think, without sentimentalizing it or idealizing it. It has many advantages that the outside world lacks--the support of friends and family, similar values, a close-knit community, the homogeneity of religious beliefs, and their peaceful, pacifistic ways. Speaking of which, the scene in which Ford beats the snot out of a couple of arrogant townies who are insulting the Amish (not realizing Ford is a tough cop), was pretty cool. Wished I'd been there to help because I hate bullies. :-)The tension and the drama build up to a very satisfying climax and director Weir shows a very firm and confident hand with his material in this movie, only his second for the American market.",5,Terrific,1264464000,"01 26, 2010",2010,1658,"['Please', 'note', 'saw', 'movie', 'HBO', 'recently', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'quality', 'video', 'transfer.I', 'just', 'saw', 'movie', 'again', '25', 'years', 'held', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'fact', 'looking', 'back', 'now', '35', 'years', 'first', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movie', 'witness', 'pick', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'time', 'career', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'last', 'Star', 'Wars', 'trilogy', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'almost', 'all', 'had', 'done', 'Witness', 'startlingly', 'nuanced', 'sensitive', 'performance', 'hard', 'imagine', ""'re"", 'even', 'seeing', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'macho', 'devil-may-care', 'Han', 'Solo', 'McGillis', 'also', 'great', 'up', 'till', 'then', 'had', 'only', 'appeared', 'one', 'two', 'movies', 'mainly', 'TV', 'serial', 'remember', 'right.The', 'drama', 'tension', 'builds', 'clash', 'contrast', 'two', 'cultures', 'Ford', 'drawn', 'Amish', 'way', 'life', 'even', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'who', 'are', 'chasing', 'Amish', 'way', 'life', 'portrayed', 'well', 'think', 'sentimentalizing', 'idealizing', 'many', 'advantages', 'outside', 'world', 'support', 'friends', 'family', 'similar', 'values', 'close-knit', 'community', 'homogeneity', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'peaceful', 'pacifistic', 'ways', 'Speaking', 'scene', 'Ford', 'snot', 'couple', 'arrogant', 'townies', 'who', 'are', 'insulting', 'Amish', 'not', 'realizing', 'Ford', 'tough', 'cop', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Wished', ""'d"", 'been', 'there', 'help', 'hate', 'bullies', 'tension', 'drama', 'build', 'up', 'very', 'satisfying', 'climax', 'director', 'Weir', 'very', 'firm', 'confident', 'hand', 'material', 'movie', 'only', 'second', 'American', 'market']",Witness VHS

213691,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6300214567,Martin Asiner,"[2, 3]","By the time Harrison Ford made WITNESS, he was midway through a career that most often emphasized dashing derring-do.  As police officer John Book, Ford gets the chance to combine his frequent persona of heroism with the less obvious trait of intense inner turmoil.  Ford slips into his role as detective Book with consummate ease as he interviews a smart Amish boy (Lukas Haas) who has just witnessed a murder.  Book is all police professionalism, until he meets the boy's gorgeous widowed mother, Rachel, played by Kelly McGillis in her first featured role.  The focus of interest is on the seemingly insurmountable gap that exists between Book's world of urban technology and Rachel's world of horse-drawn carriages.  The plot outside of their romance is paper-thin.  The boy has witnessed a rogue cop murder another officer in an act of witnessing that brings out a wide scale eruption of top level police corruption.  Yet the palpable chemistry of Ford and McGillis is so potent that the viewer scarcely notices the holes in logic that would stand out if only that viewer were not so immersed in the rarest of all movie themes: the clashing of cultures that brings out the best of both.  Director Peter Weir is careful not to show the Amish as country bumpkins.  Rather he shows a people that despite some inevitable clannishness are truly noble and brave.  Some of the most effective and moving scenes that I have ever watched on the big screen are here enormously memorable precisely because they underplay the tension of a moment that seems insignificant to gawky tourists but reveal to the audience that when an Amish man suffers the indignity of passive resistance against some redneck city boors, it is he, rather than the more daring John Book, who shows courage and forebearance.  Yet, part of the movie's charm is that no one character labels his world or actions as any better than the other's.  What emerges after the required shoot-em-up ending is a subtext that suggests that witnessing the way of a world that is not one's own does not mean that one must succeed in crossing the chasm to reach the other side in safety.  John Book finds out that it is often enough to reach out his hand to another to find out that both worlds are less different than at first glance.",5,Ford at his Best,1047168000,"03 9, 2003",2003,2286,"['time', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'made', 'WITNESS', 'was', 'midway', 'career', 'most', 'often', 'emphasized', 'dashing', 'derring-do', 'police', 'officer', 'John', 'Book', 'Ford', 'chance', 'combine', 'frequent', 'persona', 'heroism', 'less', 'obvious', 'trait', 'intense', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'Ford', 'role', 'detective', 'Book', 'consummate', 'ease', 'smart', 'Amish', 'boy', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'who', 'just', 'witnessed', 'murder', 'Book', 'police', 'professionalism', 'boy', 'gorgeous', 'widowed', 'mother', 'Rachel', 'played', 'Kelly', 'McGillis', 'first', 'featured', 'role', 'focus', 'interest', 'seemingly', 'insurmountable', 'gap', 'Book', 'world', 'urban', 'technology', 'Rachel', 'world', 'horse-drawn', 'carriages', 'plot', 'romance', 'paper-thin', 'boy', 'witnessed', 'rogue', 'cop', 'murder', 'officer', 'act', 'witnessing', 'out', 'wide', 'scale', 'eruption', 'top', 'level', 'police', 'corruption', 'palpable', 'chemistry', 'Ford', 'McGillis', 'so', 'potent', 'viewer', 'scarcely', 'holes', 'logic', 'would', 'stand', 'out', 'only', 'viewer', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'immersed', 'rarest', 'movie', 'themes', 'clashing', 'cultures', 'out', 'best', 'Director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'careful', 'not', 'show', 'Amish', 'country', 'bumpkins', 'people', 'inevitable', 'clannishness', 'are', 'truly', 'noble', 'brave', 'most', 'effective', 'moving', 'scenes', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'big', 'screen', 'are', 'here', 'enormously', 'memorable', 'precisely', 'underplay', 'tension', 'moment', 'insignificant', 'gawky', 'tourists', 'reveal', 'audience', 'when', 'Amish', 'man', 'indignity', 'passive', 'resistance', 'redneck', 'city', 'boors', 'rather', 'more', 'daring', 'John', 'Book', 'who', 'courage', 'forebearance', 'part', 'movie', 'charm', 'one', 'character', 'world', 'actions', 'better', 'other', 'What', 'required', 'shoot-em-up', 'ending', 'subtext', 'witnessing', 'way', 'world', 'not', 'one', 'own', 'not', 'mean', 'one', 'must', 'succeed', 'crossing', 'chasm', 'reach', 'other', 'side', 'safety', 'John', 'Book', 'out', 'often', 'enough', 'reach', 'out', 'hand', 'find', 'out', 'worlds', 'are', 'less', 'different', 'first', 'glance']",Witness VHS

Other reviewers have outlined the plot more clearly and cleverly than I could either add or detract. This was the film  that brought the Menonite community of Lancaster county,Pennsylvania to the  attention of the world it had tried so hard to turn its back on. The  producers neglect to mention if permission was sought from the Amish to  film within their environment. If so then it must have been to their  everlasting regret. &quot;Alas poor amish I knew them well&quot;. From what  we hear Lancaster county has been beseiged with tourists and curiosity  seekers even some 14 years after the films release. Enough said.I can  only add more positive comments to what other reviewers have said to what  is a very suspenseful and original thriller with some superb performances  by Lukas Haas, Danny Glover and Kelly McGillis in particular. Probably the  best scene for me was at the police precinct when the young boy is  exploring his strange surroundings as children do and unexpectedly comes  across the killers picture in the most unexpected place. In the hustle and  bustle of a busy police station only detective Book notices the boys  astonishment and comes across to see the cause. And then the truth suddenly  dawns on both of them... This should have been a stepping stone to a more  successful career but alas McGillis seems to have slipped from our screens  of late. Also of note was the superb photography, especially during the  barn raising scenes and the music by Maurice Jarre which seemed to capture  just the right ambience of this quaint rural community. Also look out for a  small cameo by Viggo Mortensen. No doubt many have viewed  &quot;Witness&quot; time and time again with reruns and video releases but  it is always a treat if you can to sit down and watch with a friend who has  not yet &quot;witnessed&quot; it.

213695,AMG2LF8MLUDN1,6300214567,M. Fields,"[3, 3]","Here is an interesting twist.  A crime drama that doesn't primarily focus on the crime.  The murder of a detective is what opens this film.  John Book ( why are all cops and detectives named John?) (Harrison Ford) is assigned to the case which takes him to Amish country to hide out from the killers.  Here's where the story really begins.  A modern 20th century cop amidst people who are living, somewhat, in the 19th century.  The film's focus is on the cultural, social and moral differences between the two worlds.  Harrison's character developes an attraction to the mother of the witness he's trying to protect.  Samuel (Lucas Haas) is a wide eyed innocent little boy that witnesses the murder.  His mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis) is none too pleased that her son is involved in the investigation and  wants nothing to do with that part of the ""outside"" world.Let's face it, it's a Harrison Ford film so we already know that he's going to get the bad guys.  The excitement comes from how the killers track him down and what they try to do when they find him but more importantly, Ford's relationship with the mother, her father, son and the rest of the Amish community.  Sort of a fish out of the water story so to speak.This film contains some lovely cinematography.  During the barn raising scene there is a shot of all the men climbing through the rafters of the barn which is set against the blue sky.  The contrast is wonderful.  The editing is a little less impressive.  In one scene where one of the bad guys holds Rachel hostage, John tries to convince her captor to let her go.  Both men have guns and the bad guy is telling John to put his gun down after John has already dropped the gun to the floor and said that the gun was down. (just one of those little things that make movies more interesting) ;)Here's one interesting little factiod, watch for the scene in the beginning of the film where Harrison's character speaks to a janitor that he thinks is the witness.

213702,AKUSIO6C5EAK4,6300214567,"Mr. A. P. Venables ""andi02""","[0, 0]","Witness is a pretty decent film.  The story begins with a young Hamish boy witnessing a brutal murder on his first visit to a big city.  John Book (Ford) then enters the story, a tough city cop who has to protect his witness.The film examines the class of two cultures, the Amish and city folk.  Book slowly begins to be influenced by the Amish way of life and begins to fall for an Amish girl.  The idea of a cop going being influenced by foreign values has been done since (Black Rain, Red Heat) but never as well.  At times you feel like you're watching two separate films, one about the Amish and a fairly conventional cop thriller.Witness is very well written (Raymond Frensham refers to Witness as a template in his book Teach Yourself Screenwriting).  Barely a scene is wasted and all of them work within the story.  The soundtrack and the film in general is very eighties.

213703,AB5DVSNPX1JSK,6300214567,"Mr. Fisher ""grand_clown""","[9, 21]","Witness is critically acclaimed and everyone likes it, but probably me.  There's something lacking in this film that keeps it from my honor list (four stars or above).  As usual, the acting is fine when Ford is included, but the story line bothers me a bit and I think I know what's missing.John Book is Ford's character and he takes up a case which includes an Amish boy and his sister, big sis, and the uncovering of crooked cops in his own precinct.  The Amish boy witnesses a murder and Book finds out its a cop behind it, but as he investigates he gets shot and he escapes with the boy and his sis to Amish territory where he seeks assylum.This movie has some really good points, so let me point them out first.1. Harrison Ford is outstanding, why he didn't win best actor for this the world will never know, but he did a great job with a city cop who has to change and learn of a new culture far from his own.2. This film put the Amish and their culture for America to learn about.  I admire their culture and beliefs and their moral duties, which you learn a great deal about.  Again, I am all for movies that teach you things as well as entertain you at the same time.  This film does that, sort of.3. The plot is original, for its time, although many spins have made off it, films that now make fun or attempt to include the Amish in it have come about as a result to this film's success.Here's the problem with it.  The film was intended to be a romance/thriller/drama and it failed.  The thrillingness of it is very good, it is successful at keep us glued seeing if the bad cops will find Ford stashed with the Amish.  But the romance and drama are pitiful and unrealistic.Ford's character, although believable, is kind of lost.  He finds himself at the care of these Amish folks and yet he doesn't know what to do.  He can't return to the city cops, so he just sits there and bides his time.  I never could figure this out.  Why doesn't he go to a different city?  Seek out of state jurisdiction?  Instead he just remains, willingly, among the Amish learning their customs as he checks in with his partner to see how things are.  But this is so stupid and unbelievable.  Damn, if I was him I'd be on the move.  Who cares if your car doesn't work, walk or borrow a carriage of theirs.  Sheesh!OK, the romance is dumb.  I don't think it works and the reason why I think it doesn't works is because Kelly McGillis' character has to step out of character for it to even happen, which is a total no no.  There is this one scene that makes me puke, it is when McGillis is bathing and she doesn't mind that Book is watching her in the nude.  She even turns to stare at him, showing all like ""Come and get me, big boy.""This is not a born and bred Amish gal, this is stupid Hollywood being perverted.  It's this incident that takes her out of character for good and it ruins the movie, making viewers uncomfortable like me.  A real Amish girl would never do such a thing.  I almost wonder if the director knew this but did it anyway to make a statement or demonstrate that ""physical pleasure is more important than one's Faith.""  It wouldn't surprise me.This film would've been better if McGillis's character hadn't turned into a sex symbol, but been a woman who loved her Faith more than her own lust.  That would've been character development and more realistic.  I guess I'm so sick of these lady roles being these easy, bare all sex symbols that have no personality or originality in their character.The end is also unbelievable.  Three bad cops show up to find Book and kill him, so they go right into the heart of the Amish community and start shooting up the place.  This reminded me of a cheesy western that Clint Eastwood would sport.  Give me a break.This film has some reality in it, but a whole lot of typical hollywood as well.  I'm sorry, but the out of step character of McGillis and the ending was just unsatisfactory to give this movie more than three stars.",3,Witnessing what?,1060819200,"08 14, 2003",2003,3978,"['Witness', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'everyone', 'probably', 'something', 'lacking', 'film', 'honor', 'list', 'four', 'stars', 'above', 'usual', 'acting', 'fine', 'when', 'Ford', 'included', 'story', 'line', 'bothers', 'bit', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'missing.John', 'Book', 'Ford', 'character', 'up', 'case', 'Amish', 'boy', 'sister', 'big', 'sis', 'uncovering', 'crooked', 'cops', 'own', 'precinct', 'Amish', 'boy', 'murder', 'Book', 'out', 'cop', 'shot', 'boy', 'sis', 'Amish', 'territory', 'where', 'assylum.This', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'points', 'so', 'let', 'point', 'out', 'first.1', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'outstanding', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'best', 'actor', 'world', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'city', 'cop', 'who', 'change', 'learn', 'new', 'culture', 'far', 'own.2', 'film', 'put', 'Amish', 'culture', 'America', 'learn', 'admire', 'culture', 'beliefs', 'moral', 'duties', 'learn', 'great', 'deal', 'Again', 'am', 'movies', 'teach', 'things', 'as', 'well', 'entertain', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'sort', 'of.3', 'plot', 'original', 'time', 'many', 'spins', 'have', 'made', 'now', 'make', 'fun', 'attempt', 'include', 'Amish', 'have', 'come', 'result', 'film', 'success.Here', 'problem', 'film', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'romance/thriller/drama', 'failed', 'thrillingness', 'very', 'good', 'successful', 'keep', 'glued', 'seeing', 'bad', 'cops', 'will', 'find', 'Ford', 'stashed', 'Amish', 'romance', 'drama', 'are', 'pitiful', 'unrealistic.Ford', 'character', 'believable', 'kind', 'lost', 'care', 'Amish', 'folks', 'yet', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'return', 'city', 'cops', 'just', 'there', 'bides', 'time', 'never', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'Why', ""n't"", 'go', 'different', 'city', 'Seek', 'state', 'jurisdiction', 'Instead', 'just', 'willingly', 'Amish', 'learning', 'customs', 'partner', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'so', 'stupid', 'unbelievable', 'Damn', 'was', ""'d"", 'be', 'move', 'Who', 'car', ""n't"", 'work', 'walk', 'borrow', 'carriage', 'theirs', 'Sheesh', 'OK', 'romance', 'dumb', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'reason', 'why', 'think', ""n't"", 'works', 'Kelly', 'McGillis', 'character', 'step', 'out', 'character', 'even', 'happen', 'total', 'one', 'scene', 'puke', 'when', 'McGillis', 'bathing', ""n't"", 'mind', 'Book', 'watching', 'nude', 'even', 'stare', 'showing', 'Come', 'get', 'big', 'boy', 'not', 'born', 'bred', 'Amish', 'gal', 'stupid', 'Hollywood', 'being', 'perverted', 'incident', 'character', 'good', 'movie', 'making', 'viewers', 'uncomfortable', 'real', 'Amish', 'girl', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'thing', 'almost', 'wonder', 'director', 'knew', 'did', 'anyway', 'make', 'statement', 'demonstrate', 'physical', 'pleasure', 'more', 'important', 'one', 'Faith', 'would', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'me.This', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'McGillis', 'character', 'had', ""n't"", 'turned', 'sex', 'symbol', 'been', 'woman', 'who', 'loved', 'Faith', 'more', 'own', 'lust', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'character', 'development', 'more', 'realistic', 'guess', ""'m"", 'so', 'sick', 'lady', 'roles', 'being', 'easy', 'bare', 'sex', 'symbols', 'have', 'personality', 'originality', 'character.The', 'end', 'also', 'unbelievable', 'Three', 'bad', 'cops', 'show', 'up', 'find', 'Book', 'kill', 'go', 'right', 'heart', 'Amish', 'community', 'start', 'shooting', 'up', 'place', 'reminded', 'cheesy', 'western', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'would', 'sport', 'Give', 'break.This', 'film', 'reality', 'whole', 'lot', 'typical', 'hollywood', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'out', 'step', 'character', 'McGillis', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'unsatisfactory', 'give', 'movie', 'more', 'three', 'stars']",Witness VHS

213712,A3M3X0BDWGT4D7,6300214567,Outdoors Survival Guy,"[0, 0]","For anyone who has seen enough movies, they will start to notice a pattern-this pattern being the ""one-sided"" character.  Bad guys who are more like brainless killing machines, good guys who never make mistakes, and stereotypical cultural behavior are all aspects of Hollywood film production these days.  However, movies like Witness have the ability to entertain as well as challenge the Hollywood stereotypes that were so prevelant in the 80's when this film was made.This is the story of John Book, a Philadelphia police detective who is assigned to investigate a muder in a train station restroom.  The only witness is a young boy named Samuel.  Samuel is quite different from many children his age, as he is Amish.  However, this difference is portrayed with a sense of admiration and respect that serves a purpose.  When Samuel recognizes one of the killers as a police detective, Book attempts to report this to his superiors at the police department.  The attempt to go through proper channels backfires when Book is ambushed, wounded, and nearly killed in a parking garage.With a bullet wound and concern for the safety of Samuel, his mother (Rachel) and himself, Book flees the city and seeks refuge in the Amish community where Samuel lives.  Gradually, Book is nursed back to health and begins the process of learning the Amish lifestyle.  What develops during the rest of the film is a down to earth look at what happens when two worlds mix together and the good/bad elements of both.  I won't give away all of the plot details, but I will say that there are several scenes that challenge Hollywood stereotypes.Some people may criticize Kelly McGillis' portrayal of Rachel, saying that a real Amish woman would not act that way.  However, Amish folks are human beings who feel sexual desire, confusion, and pressure from the family and social surroundings just like we do. Rachel does seem to give in to her attraction for Book, but in the end her devotion to the Amish lifestyle prevails; the interaction with Book shows an inner struggle within herself to figure out what she really values in life.During the movie, the Amish also learn more about Book and realize that he has value as a worker and as a person, and they cannot condemn him simply because he is from modern society.  There are a couple of weak points in this movie.  One of them is the performance by Danny Glover, who has very little screen time and does not get to use his talent as an actor very much.  Even though he is a bad guy in the film, I believe he could have shown some depth if given the opportunity.  The climax scene with the shootout seemed a bit heavy handed and poorly planned for the characters.  I mean if they had law enforcement training, weapons training, and were good at covering up corruption, they could have come up with a better attack plan than barging in and shooting up the farm in broad daylight.The one redeeming quality is when the surviving attacker has a moment of remorse and humanity at the end.  This proves to be the only depth of character in the movie's villans.  Overall, this is an enjoyable film and has some nice scenery, which was filmed in Lancaster County, PA.

The essential interest is the contrast between the cynical world of a Philadelphia homicide detective and the bucolic, spiritual life of the Amish, in Lancaster County, not that far away geographically, but worlds away in lifestyle.  The story portrays the Amish community with great respect and sensitivity, neither romanticizing them or diminishing them.  Well, maybe it does lean a little towards romanticism.No matter, the life that the film shows the Amish living is a beautiful life.  There is an amazing scene in which the community rallies together to raise a barn in one day for a newlywed couple.The cast is perfect.  Harrison Ford plays the somewhat jaded but still decent cop.  He looks perfect in a cheap khaki suit.  Kelly McGillis is nothing short of superb as the young Amish widow whose path crosses his, with unexpected consequences.  She plays it just right doing the difficult balance between her respect for her family and tradition and her undeniable feelings for the cop.There are other wonderful performances.  Alexander Gudenov is wonderfully charming as the cop's competition.  If you look closely, you'll see a young, very cute Viggo Mortensen as Gudenov's brother.The child who plays the young Amish boy is perfectly cast and totally believable and lovable as the witness.The romance between the woman and the cop is beautifully shown...the restraint that's built into the situation (he's living in her father's house under the watchful eyes of the whole community) adds enormously to the tension of the romance.  So much is said with glances and McGillis has the eyes to convey what she dares not say with words.Balancing the gentleness of the almost-romance is the violence of the criminals.  Weir balances it all together masterfully.  It could have been a mess in other hands but in his, it is a small but lovely masterpiece.",5,"Good story, great acting, beautiful cinematography",1290297600,"11 21, 2010",2010,1898,"['all-round', 'wonderful', 'picture', 'essential', 'interest', 'contrast', 'cynical', 'world', 'Philadelphia', 'homicide', 'detective', 'bucolic', 'spiritual', 'life', 'Amish', 'Lancaster', 'County', 'not', 'far', 'away', 'geographically', 'away', 'lifestyle', 'story', 'Amish', 'community', 'great', 'respect', 'sensitivity', 'romanticizing', 'diminishing', 'Well', 'maybe', 'lean', 'little', 'towards', 'romanticism.No', 'matter', 'life', 'film', 'Amish', 'living', 'beautiful', 'life', 'amazing', 'scene', 'community', 'together', 'raise', 'barn', 'one', 'day', 'newlywed', 'couple.The', 'cast', 'perfect', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'somewhat', 'jaded', 'still', 'decent', 'cop', 'perfect', 'cheap', 'khaki', 'suit', 'Kelly', 'McGillis', 'nothing', 'short', 'superb', 'young', 'Amish', 'widow', 'path', 'unexpected', 'consequences', 'just', 'right', 'doing', 'difficult', 'balance', 'respect', 'family', 'tradition', 'undeniable', 'feelings', 'cop.There', 'are', 'other', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Alexander', 'Gudenov', 'wonderfully', 'charming', 'cop', 'competition', 'look', 'closely', ""'ll"", 'see', 'young', 'very', 'cute', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Gudenov', 'brother.The', 'child', 'who', 'young', 'Amish', 'boy', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'totally', 'believable', 'lovable', 'witness.The', 'romance', 'woman', 'cop', 'beautifully', 'shown', 'restraint', 'built', 'situation', 'living', 'father', 'house', 'watchful', 'eyes', 'whole', 'community', 'enormously', 'tension', 'romance', 'So', 'much', 'said', 'glances', 'McGillis', 'eyes', 'convey', 'what', 'not', 'say', 'words.Balancing', 'gentleness', 'almost-romance', 'violence', 'criminals', 'Weir', 'balances', 'together', 'masterfully', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'mess', 'other', 'hands', 'small', 'lovely', 'masterpiece']",Witness VHS

The story line is pretty similar; a law man has three bad guys coming for him and a girl friend who can't stand up for him because of her religious convictions against any form of violence.  In the case of ""Witness"" the law man is a Philidelphia detective (Harrison Ford) and the bad guys are some dirty cops.  A young Amish boy on a rare trip to the city witnesses a murder but is unable to communicate and so he cannot identify the murderer.  However, the fact that the murderer is a cop means that he knows that the Amish boy knows.  The scene necessarily switches to a Pennsylvania Amish community where a wounded Harrison Ford goes to hide and recover.  Being cut off from the outside world provides a cover for all until one day Ford, posing as an Amish man, creates a scene that exposes himself.  And what a scene it is.  It may be the highlight of the movie when Ford decides to show some local rowdies that not everyone with a wide brim hat turns the other cheek.  I won't say more about the plot because I don't want to spoil any of the very real suspense that the movies creates.There is a love interest in this movie that is somewhat ackward and somewhat believable.  It challenges some of our stereotypes but in a way that makes us all understand that love cries out beyond boundaries.  The protrayal of the Amish seems to be very well done although I don't pass myself off as an expert on the subject.  The clash of cultures in this movies is also handled well.  The director lets us hope but he reminds us that love can sometimes be challenged in the conquering department.""Witness"" is a quality movie.

He caught sight of the face of one of the two attackers who killed him...As the plot becomes more intricate, and through a series of interesting events, detective John Book finds himself forced to protect the shy eight-year-old boy and his helpless mother... He disappears for some days in the Amish Country...Harrison Ford stars as a fugitive cop who is initially unwelcome in a community he knows a little about... He tries to learn the importance of family and community, the philosophy of brotherhood and non-resistance... He becomes involved in a case that will essentially change his human perceptions... And later, he finds himself falling in love with a sensitive young woman...Kelly McGillis is captivating as Rachel, a woman who feels a shadow of confusion crossing her mind... She stares at the honest cop, realizing the price he's paid in returning them to safety...In one scene she catches him watching her bath... She hesitates for a moment, but in that precise moment she makes a choice... Slowly she turns to face him, topless, without shame... For a moment she attempts a tender effort to become, for an instant, a woman of his world...In another scene we see her playing the charade of her life... Bound by duty, but tempted by desire, she leaves her white cap - symbol of her identity - on the table, and surrenders to a passion, that makes her sensual nature say it all...Lukas Haas is very fine as the cute kid in the black coat and hat... He slowly raises his hand to point at the black and white photograph... This nice boy remains untouched by the violence interposed into his peaceful world...Jan Rubes is believable as Rachel's father-in-law Eli... He is torn by conflicts between faith, discipline, dedication and humility... He tries his best to protect what's left of his family from the pressures of the outside world... It's pretty clear he doesn't like this Englishman wearing the clothes of his faith... For him his daughter-in-law has brought fear to his house... and now she is dancing to English music!Alexander Godunov brings a solid performance to the role of Daniel, Rachel's discarded suitor... It's no surprise that he wants the disappearance of the policeman... Book's tempting presence will only weak his chance with Rachel... In one remarkable scene and on a road running parallel to the train track, he urges his horse almost to the gallop as he attempts to keep pace with the train...It is quite interesting to see Danny Glover as a crooked cop, who's corrupt and evil... But the heart of the movie is a study of the Pennsylvania Amish through the eyes of an outsider suddenly introduced into their life... Peter Weir tries to paint a realistic portrait of the Amish who are best known for their severely 'plain clothing' and their 'non-conformed' way of life... The Amish also avoid telephones and electric lights and drive horses and buggies rather than cars...Weir delivers a powerful and romantic story, an engaging film of different style, mixing two different cultures, the simplicity of the Amish lifestyle with the urban culture and fashion...

What's not to like?Police officer John Book (Harrison Ford) finds himself in the midst of a cop-killing.  He learns that the perps are within the Philly PD, which has an inside, corrupt bunch mixed up with the drug trade.  A young Amish boy is the witness, and the key to proving all of this.  This is easier said than done, because the bad guys are after Book/Ford, who is reluctantly taken in by the Amish.  The movie proceeds at Mach One from this point on.  The rest would be telling.This movie is about the collision between two worlds: the 19th Century Amish, and a thoroughly 20th Century police officer trying to do the right thing.  The culture clash is moving, beautifully done, and mostly avoids the cliche' of being judgmental.  Both worlds are shown sympathetically and with dignity, in a manner that highlights their differences without the expected Hollywood triteness.This is an example of a movie's musical score acting to enhance and magnify the impact of the film.

Harrison Ford gives his absolutely best performance in this film and he should have won the Oscar that year along with this film's great director, Peter Wier, who seems to be always a bride's maid and never the bride with his numerous nominations.  Wier gets perfect performances from everyone involved in this landmark film on inner city crime and the ways of the simple Amish in Lancaster, Pennsylvania (where I live).  Many actors in this film got their break here such as Jan Rubes, Lukas Hass, Kelly McGillis, Alexander Gundenoff, and Viggio Mortensen (in a quick scene).The life of Det. John Book, Ford, is brilliantly juxtaposed to the simple life the Amish live only a mere 50 miles or so out of Philadelphia.  It is carefully presented as not being a utopian society with its restrictions.  Book risks his life to protect the witness and his mother and is nearly killed himself in the process.  They nursed him to good health while he was also protecting them.  He ends up falling in love with his caretaker and the simple life and ponders giving up everything for this simple life.  Book must decide when the dust settles on the case that brought him out to Amish Country which life he wants:  the simple, quiet life of the Amish or his busy, violent life where he also saves lives.  Its not as an easy decision and we sympathize with his difficult choice.If for some reason you missed this movie when it was out or have never heard of it, reward yourself by purchasing or at least renting this outstanding film.

Anyway...I first saw this film when it first came out and I  remember I really really liked it. I was 23 years old and not a Christian at that time. Now, I am soon to be 42 and have been a Christian for over 18 years. For 10 years of my life, I lived as a Mennonite (like Amish in many ways, but we drove cars, had electricity, etc.) I am no longer a Mennonite, and now I watch films again. I appreciate classic cinema very much, but recently have wanted to watch Witness again, to see if I would like it as much as the first time, and to see if I thought they portrayed the Amish correctly.So, I watched it last night. It was interesting in that I remembered so much, even some small details about it. So it really did impress me that first time when I was young. This time, I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't say it is a film I would watch over and over again, as I watch some classic films. To see it once more was enough to just satisfy my curiosity about my memories of it.I did feel they portrayed the Amish quite well, with the clothes and such. What they did wrong about the portrayal was that in no way would it be allowed for an Amish woman to tend to a wounded man who wasn't her husband, by herself in a room alone with him. It just isn't proper, isn't done. In reality, a man would have done that, or an older woman would have done it, with another woman there. I think the movie allowed the Rachel character to have way more &quot;access&quot; to a man alone than would be allowed in a real Amish or Mennonite community. I doubt he would have really been allowed to stay in the house. In reality he would have been placed in a home with a family who had a bunch of boys and he would work with them and the father, and not have all that time alone with Rachel.I don't like violence...I knew that the bad part happened in the train station in the beginning, so we were able to fast forward that part. Also, we were able to fast forward the ending &quot;shoot out&quot; stuff. I didn't care for the bad language. The scene with Rachel taking her sponge bath, well when I was young and not a Christian, I found that very romantic. Now, I found it rather silly. A devout Amish girl/woman would not have just calmly turned around and let a man stare at her while unclothed. And later on, when she and he finally &quot;meet&quot; for the romantic moment, I found that sort of offensive. Why kiss out in the yard where anyone could see you? Eli could have easily looked out the window (a real Amish father would have kept better tabs on his daughter with a strange man around the place). I felt that scene was very much just an animal passion thing...sort of vulgar. Not at all romantic, truly loving or gentle. It seems people sure knew how to kiss and show romantic love a lot better in the old movies! And right before she went out there, she took her prayer veiling off. Which again, no Amish woman would do. But then she obviously was rebelling. There was that other time too, when she and John Book were in the barn listening to his radio, and she had it off then, and I am not sure why, for no Amish or Mennonite woman will go without it in front of people or outside the house.The ending left me wondering...would Rachel just go ahead and marry Daniel? Would she really be happy with him? She really would have to repent of her sins with John Book to be truly happy. I also noticed that the film never showed a church service. Also, none of the Amish folks never seemed to care to tell John Book how to be a Christian. But then there are many Amish who are not born- again Christians, but just are &quot;culturally Amish&quot;...they live the way they do because they have always done so. These must have been that type of Amish. It did seem that Grandfather knew the Bible...he quoted some good verses when talking to the boy about the gun. That was good to see, yet sad that such violence had to even be witnessed by this child.Oh, of course any film with Amish must have a barn raising scene, and this one did. Also, so many movies with cows mus have the scene where the city person doesn't know how to milk a cow. Of course John Book must learn.

Ford's character is usually street-smart (or something similar), there's always action, and more often than not he and his romantic interest are hesitant to admit their feelings for each other. While Peter Weir's `Witness' fits the mold technically, somehow this movie feels very different from anything else Ford has ever done  (Including the little known, `Mosquito Coast').Ford stars as a stubborn Philadelphia cop named John Book, who is in charge of the investigation when an undercover police officer is murdered in a public restroom. Ford identifies one of the murderers with the help of a wide-eyed Amish boy named Samuel (played by the adorable Lukas Haas). However, as soon as he has disclosed this information to a superior who he trusts, the murderer is after him and Samuel.  Kelly McGillis plays the female lead, Rachel - Samuel's mother, and Danny Glover and Patti LuPone (the stage actress who originated the role of Fantine in Les Mis&eacute;rables) also star.`Witness' is undoubtedly a good movie, and Ford makes his part seem incredibly human, to the point that you start to forget he's acting and begin to wonder why he almost won an Oscar for such a simple role. `Witness' possesses none of the glitz and glamour of Ford's other blockbusters; however, it is still one of the standout movies of its decade and a completely recommendable film.",5,The Best Performance of Ford's Career,1059091200,"07 25, 2003",2003,1436,"['Most', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'movies', 'have', 'considerable', 'number', 'things', 'common', 'Ford', 'character', 'usually', 'street-smart', 'something', 'similar', 'always', 'action', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'romantic', 'interest', 'are', 'hesitant', 'admit', 'feelings', 'other', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'Witness', 'mold', 'technically', 'somehow', 'movie', 'very', 'different', 'anything', 'else', 'Ford', 'ever', 'done', 'Including', 'little', 'known', 'Mosquito', 'Coast', '.Ford', 'stubborn', 'Philadelphia', 'cop', 'named', 'John', 'Book', 'who', 'charge', 'investigation', 'when', 'undercover', 'police', 'officer', 'murdered', 'public', 'restroom', 'Ford', 'one', 'murderers', 'help', 'wide-eyed', 'Amish', 'boy', 'named', 'Samuel', 'played', 'adorable', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'However', 'as', 'soon', 'disclosed', 'information', 'superior', 'who', 'murderer', 'Samuel', 'Kelly', 'McGillis', 'female', 'lead', 'Rachel', 'Samuel', 'mother', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Patti', 'LuPone', 'stage', 'actress', 'who', 'originated', 'role', 'Fantine', 'Les', 'Mis', 'eacute', 'rables', 'also', 'star.', 'Witness', 'undoubtedly', 'good', 'movie', 'Ford', 'part', 'seem', 'incredibly', 'human', 'point', 'start', 'forget', 'acting', 'begin', 'wonder', 'why', 'almost', 'won', 'Oscar', 'simple', 'role', 'Witness', 'none', 'glitz', 'glamour', 'Ford', 'other', 'blockbusters', 'however', 'still', 'one', 'standout', 'movies', 'decade', 'completely', 'recommendable', 'film']",Witness VHS

In maybe Ford's greatest role outside of Indian Jones or Star Wars, he plays detective John Book who is investigating the death of a police office in a restroom of a Philadelphia train station.  The only witness is young Amish boy named Samuel Lapp (lukas Haas) who was travelling with his mother Rachael (Kelly McGillis).  Book is shocked when little Samuel identifies another detective as the man who committed the murder and who along with some other dirty cops is now out to eliminate the 'witness'.When Book is wounded protecting Samuel and his mother, they return back to the Amish village to hideout and recover.  The next portion of the film deals with Ford trying to fit into the strange new world of the Amish and learning their ways.  Cultures clash often, particularly in regards to Rachael who has no husband and who has become attracted to Book, much to the horror of her father in law Eli (Jan Rubes).  Eli is none to happy about this outsider being within their midst and influencing his daughter-in-law and grandson.Book soon gains acceptance and in typical Amish fashion, helps them with a barn raising.  In a memorable scene, several Amish travel into town in carriages only to be harassed by a group of young punks.  When Book gets out to defend them he's told by Eli that ""It's not our way""  Book replies, ""No, but it's MY way!"" and proceeds to kick the tar out of the thugs.  The bad cops eventually learn where Book is hiding out leading to a rather standard climactic shoot-out.Alexander Gudonov co-stars as a suitor to Rachael who will only be too happy to see Book leave their community and Danny Glover rounds out the cast as one of the diry cops.  Ford Received an Oscar nomination (his only one) for this role and deservedly so.  I'm not a huge Ford fan but he shows a depth to his performance in this picture that is often missing from many of his one dimensional roles.  The Amish community was very well depicted and made for an interesting change in setting for a movie of this type.

Perhaps the only real flaw is the moment when the father (Jan Rubes) gestures to his grandson to get the gun.  This is a betrayal of the whole tenor of the Amish side of things -- it was unnecessary, one of those ""Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" moments characteristic of American film where in spite of the rhetoric, a gun is the ultimate solution.  Some things were a bit hamhanded -- for example, we didn't need every one of the hot glimpses between the lovers in the barn raising.  The last scene of all revealed Harrison Ford's limitations: he just looks, and looks -- the laconic American -- and it gets a little boring.But the film is lovely and spacious -- I had forgotten the first five minutes, all in Pennsylvania Dutch/German (!).  And of course the barn raising is special:  this is what a real community does.  There is something not quite strong enough about the community witnessing at the end as the final weapon -- it should have been ramped up a bit I feel.  The community should have somehow gotten in the way and made the difference more strikingly.The best things are Weir's cinematography (especially in the erotic lamplit night scenes), and Jarre's great score (I prefer the barn raising passacaglia with an orchestra myself as opposed to the electronic score, but it really does give you a feeling for why a passacaglia and fugue can be driving and emotional -- for those who think Bach is boring).

Since Harrison Ford is the wounded cop, they aren't complaining. She nurses Ford back to health and he shields them from bad cops who want the boy dead; the kid saw one of them (Danny Glover) kill an undercover agent in a train station rest room.Ford, stretching as an actor, is oddly vulnerable as a fish out of water. Haas, now a young man, remarks on his work and how Weir coaxed it out of him. In a bit of bravura casting, the late Russian ballet dancer Alexander Goudunov and Viggo Mortensen (in his film debut) register as rugged Amish brothers, and Patti LuPone, the Broadway musical star, plays Ford's sister.

His first ""American"" movie, ""Witness"" deals with the conflict between two cultures and, in a sense, two centuries as part of a much more conventional police drama about an Amish boy (Lukas Haas) who witnesses the murder of an undercover police officer in the men's room of a train station. His mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis) is traveling with the boy and both are drawn into the police investigation. What Detective Captain John Book (Harrison Ford) who is investigating the case doesn't realize is that someone is out to kill them both. As a result, Book goes undercover himself taking them back to the Amish community they come from and hiding out with them there until he can resolve who is trying to kill them.Featuring a rich, startling performance from Ford and a powerful turn by Kelly McGillis (who had only appeared on ""One Life to Live"", a TV movie and the marvelous film ""Rueben, Rueben"" at that point in her career) ""Witness"" still manages to amaze with the suspense that Weir generates in the film. His focus on the contrasting cultural values of Book and the Amish community makes the film much more than a conventional ""B"" movie police crime drama adding depth and nuance to the film.A much needed improvement over the previous edition of ""Witness"", this collector's edition looks sharp with vivid colors, sharp image quality and very few digital artifacts. Blacks are rock solid throughout. The original release was a non-anamorphic widescreen image and, as such, this anamorphic presentation is a huge improvement over the previous edition of the movie. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround mix sounds solid throughout.The original ""Witness"" was released bare bones so this new edition is a welcome change. There's a 5 part documentary ""Between Two Worlds"" which features new interviews with producer Edward S. Feldman, director Peter Weir, actors Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis. Feldman discusses how the original script was presented to many directors (including director David Cronenberg ""The Fly"") and many turned it down. Feldman and his wife happened to see Weir's ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" and he commented to his wife about how that was ""a movie"" and how perfect he would be to direct the film. McGillis discusses how lucky she was to work with Ford and Weir on one of her first major movies. Ford focuses on how difficult it can be to work with a Foreign director where English isn't their primary language so they can frequently lose the nuance of the performance. As Ford points out Weir had the advantage of their common language plus the added advantage of being an outsider culturally giving added perspective to the film. Weir's comments are, not surprisingly, the most valuable as he discusses the challenges of making a film in the United States vs. his home country. He also focuses on how he made substantial changes to the script shifting the point of view from Rachel (McGillis) to Book (Ford) since Book was the outsider in Amish country much like Weir was with the American crew and actors. His perceptive comments are always valuable it's a pity he's not a believer in doing film commentary tracks. He also points out that the sequence in the grain tower was improvised and created by he and Ford a couple of days before shooting as they wanted their ""High Noon"" like showdown to have something different and unique that might take advantage of the setting.We get one deleted scene that was added to the network broadcast (it isn't integrated here into the feature either). Like ""The Truman Show"" it's clear why the deleted scene was cut although it wouldn't have damaged the pacing of the film all that much. Still, the point made in the deleted sequence where Book's nephews show the Amish boy his first video game is charming; thematically it's echoed by other far superior sequences throughout the film. There are also the original TV spots and theatrical teaser and trailer for the movie.""Witness"" was a pivotal film for director Weir as it cemented his reputation as a major film director. It also set the stage for his collaboration with Ford on the underrated ""The Mosquito Coast"" as well as Weir's work with producer Edward Feldman on ""The Truman Show"" another pivotal film in Weir's career. Although he didn't wriwrite ""Witness"", Weir brought his experience as a writer/director to the film and kept the original writers on board to retool the script to fit his unique vision. Typically, the film was honored with an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay but Weir was passed over as director (as he continues to be much like Hitchcock and Welles two other giants of the cinema to which Weir can be compared for his unique personal vision). Paramount has done a great job here improving the transfer as well adding much needed extras to this classic contemporary film. Although 20 years old, ""Witness"" holds up extremely well today (Weir comments that he thought that it was the one film would be least likely to continue to hold up well and has been pleasantly surprised). Definitely worth an upgrade for fans of this terrific movie!",5,Great movie receives much deserved upgraded DVD,1123977600,"08 14, 2005",2005,5222,"['Made', 'immediately', 'Year', 'Living',

213752,AP3B615GM191G,6300214567,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 1]","Of the many movies I have reviewed on Amazon thus far, ""Witness"" is a strange one in that while it does contain some great scenes, it is (at its core) quite formulaic and very much a product of its times (i.e. doesn't hold up quite as well over time).For a basic plot summary, ""Witness"" is a story about a young Amish boy named Samuel (Lukas Haas), who witnesses a police officer murder another man in cold blood.  Along with mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis), Samuel is put under the protective custody of Detective John Book (Harrison Ford), where they ultimately end up back in the Amish settlement.There are, indeed, quite a few great moments in this movie.  The concept in and of itself is fascinated (a closer look at the Amish), and in this respect the acting of Harrison Ford is truly the stalwart quality of the entire film.  Some of the best scenes, including the now-iconic ""ice cream cone scene"", involve Ford's character trying to fit in or adjust to the foreign (at least to his way of thinking) Amish society.The reason this film is no classic, though, is because it is very paint-by-numbers in many respects.  It was as if the studio sat down and said ""Harrison Ford is big right now and McGillis has the sex appeal factor...we need to make a movie to capitalize on these two things"".  While there is nothing wrong with that of thinking, per se, it is not the kind of creative thinking from which masterpieces are usually created.  A ridiculously out-of-place McGillis nude scene is an example to prove my point.Overall, ""Witness"" is a decent flick that is too ""stock"" to ever sniff greatness.
