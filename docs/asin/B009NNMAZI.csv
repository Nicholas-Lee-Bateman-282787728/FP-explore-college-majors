Despite the political tone to the script (anti war, anti military/industrial complex) you get a lot of action for your money, great sets and some amazing FX work (you learn more about that on the Blu ray edition than the DVD).This movie is worth watching several times.

1600421,AQWCVDX13E6TV,B009NNMAZI,"Alton Lomas ""waterdweller""","[9, 13]","Let's not even bother to make comparisons between ""Olympus Has Fallen"" and ""White House Down"", even though their obviously similar story lines make it difficult to do so. ""Olympus"" was silly, but in a serious way. ""White House Down"" is just plain silly.So, turning our focus to ""White House""...First, the so-called ""security"" shown in this film is laughably inaccurate. There are long stretches featuring bad mercenary guys (or rather, cardboard cutout bad mercenary guys - ""BMGs"" hereinafter)wandering, at will, through a deserted White House, chasing down the President and assorted cardboard cutout good guys. Not possible. If the White House crashes, and goes into lockdown, there is NO free access to discrete parts of the building. People, good or bad, cannot wander around at will. A further example involves the BMGs accessing the rooftop defensive measures command/control center: guess what? They just take a ride up to the roof in an elevator that contains no security measures - not even a Key Card reader. The fact that all this occurs when the building is in full lockdown simply takes the unbelievable and makes it laughable.And yet... other elevators in the building are fully modernized and electronic. The old clunker that gets taken to the rooftop, rattles and creaks, and threatens to give out under too much weight. I suspect that this old thing, perhaps a gift from Elisha Otis himself, would have been junked by Harry Truman when he tore the White House apart in 1948 - yet there it is, as a lame, predictable plot device. Ouch.The crew of BMGs that gets into the White House on the thinnest of pretexts, ostensibly to install equipment in the Residence, simply would not pass the obsessively thorough security checks, particularly since their real identities, once the crisis is underway, are easily obtained with a few strokes of a keyboard and some vaguely defined facial-recognition software. If they're that easily identified as questionable types, they wouldn't get past the street entrances. And... firearms inside the White House? Let's be charitable and call that detail ""doubtful"". Besides... the White House already has a private theater in the East Wing.OK, then. Let's just overlook those pesky details. Let's forget, for a moment, that ""details"" are where the devil sets up residence. If security were portrayed with any degree of accuracy, the lame plot would collapse from lack of credibility. Let's go ahead, then, and suspend disbelief for a moment: The plot elements used to justify the attack on the President and the White House are extremely thin, and never explained. There's some fuss about the son of the White House Secret Service AIC and an illness affecting the man's judgment. I hate to harp on this, but if the senior Secret Service Agent in the White House were diagnosed with terminal cancer, the President and senior staff would be aware of it before the man left his doctor's office. In the film, they're not. The evil things visited upon the son are referred to several times, but never clarified.One of the larger problems is the casting of Jamie Foxx as President Sawyer. He's simply not believable: he's not, for lack of a better word, ""presidential"". A scene where he chooses to wear a pair of high end kicks to get around the besieged residence is, bluntly, ridiculous. However, Foxx's casting is perhaps no more ludicrous than James Woods in the role of the angry, cancer-ridden Secret Service Chief. It's a shame to see an actor of Woods' calibre reduced to this kind of role. I think I preferred him in ""My Name is Bill W.""... as awful as that was.And then, of course, there's Channing Tatum, the ""hunk du jour"" who appears to have been cast simply in order to have his name on the project. It certainly wasn't for his acting skills. Perhaps it helped with the financing. Of course, the impossible plot elements that lead to his being at the White House when the attack begins don't help. In fact, they strain credulity to the breaking point: right... a loose cannon Capitol Policeman, with a GED and a few college courses is called to the White House for an interview for a job on the President's Secret Service Security detail. That's exactly how they do it.I could go on for some time loading up on the film's idiotic omissions and inconsistencies... but why bother. This thing ain't worth the trouble, ain't worth the rental fee, ain't worth the energy required to operate the remote control to turn it off.This dog appears to have been written by a committee of screenwriters. Unfortunately, it also appears that they never talked to each other until the day they all had to sit down and hand in their assignments. The only consistency throughout is... the utter lack of consistency, coupled with non-existent believability. The simple fact that so many details rang false meant I was constantly saying to myself, ""that couldn't happen..."". Once that pattern develops, any chance of relaxing and enjoying the film as a vacant action thriller disappears.Maybe, if you're 14 years old and don't know any better, it might be a fun two hours. But guys, watch out. Even the bang bang shoot shoot stuff is pretty soft-core. There's hardly any blood, and definitely, no boobage.",1,"An inconsistent, poorly written bit of politico-techno-drivel.

1600427,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B009NNMAZI,Anthony L.,"[2, 3]","White House Down has gotten a lot of comparisons to another action film where terrorists invade and take over the White House; Olympus Has Fallen. But the difference between the two is, one film is intense and riveting, and the other is a rehash of stale gags, cliches, non-threatening villains, and an overglut of action.I'll give you a hint; the movie where a limo crashes into the president's pool is NOT the good one. White House Down is an utter mess. From thinly drawn characters, to terrible, cliched villains, to generic action and stupid one-liners, this is not even a guilty pleasure. This is an overdose of explosions and violence set to a terribly thin political message and a complete lack of suspense.The villains are stereotyped, played for comedic relief (always ready with a glib one-liner and a movie reference...), and never fully explored. The heroes are ALSO stereotyped, played for comedic relief, and never fully relatable. As a non-American, I felt no remorse or sympathy for anyone in the movie, except perhaps Joey King's character (a bright spot for the film).The cast IS rather good, however. Good, that is, if you like Channing Tatum being funny and Jamie Foxx being Jamie Foxx. Maggie Gylenhaal and Richard Jenkins are decent, but Jason Clarke has no room to act other than being an over-the-top baddie.James Woods is rather fun, though.So in conclusion, a few of the stunts are winners and the cast's chemistry is entertaining, but this is a rote, unimaginative, overblown, typical Emmerich movie.

By the way there, It looked like a full company of armor online in front of the WH, I heard the order given to assault, Why did only one tank move out and why did they stop when one tank was hit?

The rest go on to the objective, no matter what.The scene with the &#34;delta force&#34; helos &#34;attacking&#34; the WH?  Why did they not put their troops on the roof?  Instead they came in, and hovered beside the building.  Maybe the director should have put a big bullseye on the side, or would that have been too obvious?The presidential limo is being chased around the lawn by armored vehicles who, BTW, are blowing more rounds than they could possibly be carrying and none of the troops surrounding the grounds opens fire on those vehicles AFTER having been ordered to do so?  For that matter, they could have just blown a gate and let the limo out.

Movies like WHD just demonstrate how hard it is to catch lightning in a bottle-- even for a simple actioner like Die Hard), & I NEVER want to see the cop/FBI/CIA/ whatever the lead plays --their child held as hostage ever again in one of these stupid movies.

1600465,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B009NNMAZI,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Big dumb movies, big dumb blockbuster summer movies are sometimes what I crave. I didn't expect to like WHITE HOUSE DOWN as much as I did. It certainly exemplifies the big dumb movie. What won me over was that the movie wore its loudness and flamboyance and its popcorn creds so proudly. Director Roland Emmerich lifts the swagger of INDEPENDENCE DAY and grafts it into WHITE HOUSE DOWN, and I enjoyed it tremendously, my brain on park, eyes and ears just soaking in the spectacle.I guess I've warmed up to Channing Tatum; it took a bit. But he was so entertaining in STEP UP and 21 JUMP STREET, he kinda won me over. Here, he plays Capitol cop John Cale whose dream posting on the Secret Service's Presidential detail has just been submarined. Still, he didn't want to disappoint his eleven-year-old daughter Emily (Joey King) who accompanied him for his job interview at the White House and who, by the way, is freaky obsessed with all things White House-y. When Emily asks if they could join the White House tour, how could her dad say no?So, 2013 saw a span of four months in which the White House was invaded by armed paramilitary troops not once but twice. OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN launched in June, WHITE HOUSE DOWN released in August, near enough to each other that competitive juices may have been stoked. Thankfully, despite the overwhelming parallel beats,the two films diverge from each other enough that one can appreciate them as separate animals. Of the two, OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN is the more no-nonsense thriller, while WHITE HOUSE DOWN is a hybrid of tension and levity. Believe it or not, I find myself preferring Tatum's John Cale over Gerard Butler's Mike Banning. John Cale isn't as accomplished with the fighty fight as  disgraced former Secret Service agent Mike Banning. Cale isn't as efficient, but his comparative lack of combat polish only humanizes his character more.Two other things humanize him more: his sense of humor and his relationship with his daughter. Don't twist it now, WHITE HOUSE DOWN can claim the splashy action sequences and massive production values and all that noise, but the heart of the film rests firmly on those moments between Cale and his daughter. This kid, Joey King, is all kinds of amazing. She shines in a series of showcase scenes.Jamie Foxx almost sold me in his role. As President James William Sawyer, he generates dignity and authority. So it was a bit of a let down when he started clowning around, even though I knew that those antics were his comic bread and butter. But is it worth the laughs a funny expletive generates if the credibility of the role is compromised? But I love the easy-going chemistry between Foxx and Tatum. I'm still confounded that Tatum has turned out to have a flair for comedy. And even though I just laid a dis on Jamie Foxx, I like that, for the most part, he's restrained in his role. I'm also glad that, unlike Harrison Ford, he doesn't suddenly transform into - dunh-dunh-DUNH! - American President, Action Hero.WHITE HOUSE DOWN unfolds a sweeping plot trajectory. Roland Emmerich really does pull out all the stops. Just when you think he couldn't escalate the situation - bam! - damn thing done escalated. It helps that there's an exemplary supporting cast to keep the ship righted some. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Deputy Special Agent Finnerty who provides outside support for John Cale, never mind that earlier in the day she rejected him for a spot in the Presidential detail. James Woods gets to chew more scenery as Walker, retiring Head of the Secret Service Presidential detail. Nicolas Wright as the dedicated tour guide lightens the mood as a sort of tertiary sidekick.WHITE HOUSE DOWN, like OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN, is worth watching. It checks off the boxes required of a fun big dumb movie. Sure, it's got its chunk of flaws (it is, after all, a big dumb movie). But it's packed with blistering action sets (with Tatum performing most of his own stunts). It's a decent buddy flick that showcases the bromance between POTUS and his suddenly pressed-into-service bodyguard. And it's got Joey King, a born scene stealer if ever I saw one. And if you ever attend a White House tour and you ask if there's a secret tunnel that JFK used to sneak Marilyn Monroe into a tryst and the guide empathically says no, well, this movie would beg to differ. 4 out of 5 stars, surprisingly.The DVD's bonus stuff:- ""A Dynamic Duo: Channing Tatum & Jamie Foxx"" (00:04:09 minutes)- ""Men of Action: Stunt Training"" (00:03:43 minutes)- ""Meet the Insiders: Supporting Cast"" (00:05:13 minutes)- ""Roland Emmerich - Upping the Ante"" (00:05:08 minutes)",4,"""Omigod!

Start with a fellow who has just been rejected for a Secret Service job at the White House and his little girl who was thrilled to go along with Daddy to this storied place, as they are swept into a hosted White House tour. Now mix in some high level terrorists capturing the White House with ruthless violence and the answer is ""Yes"" for one simple reason: We have someone to root for.This PG-13 outing directed by Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"" this guy LOVES to blow up the White House!) is another CGI-fest that has an adequate (but predictable) 100-minute story that is beefed up to 131 minutes with endless gunfights, fist fights and blowie uppie stuff. Granted there must be some fighting, given the topic, but enough is enough!These folks did a fine job:* Channing Tatum (""Magic Mike"") is Cale, the fellow who takes his daughter with him to the White House. Cale is a veteran of three tours in the mid-East, so he is no stranger to military tactics.* Jamie Foxx (""Django"") is President Sawyer, earnest and frightened but dedicated to the IDEA of America, not to just one individual.* Joey King (""Ramona and Beezus"") is Emily, a little girl with a cell phone. She gets separated from Daddy and is scared to death when she sees what's happening, but she's made of pretty stern stuff.* Maggie Gyllenhaal (""Hysteria"") is Finerty, an official with the Secret Service; she has just rejected Cale for that security job.* James Woods (""Jobs"") is Walker, the head of the agency. He is smart and focused, but may be ill....* Michael Murphy (Lots of TV) is Vice President Hammond, whisked off to Air Force One for safe keeping.* Richard Jenkins (""Jack Reacher"") is Raphelson, Speaker of the House. If the President and Vice President are annihilated, the Constitution says this modest fellow is next in line.* Jason Clarke (""The Great Gatsby"") is once again, extremely effective as a bad guy. Stentz is a paramilitary leader, powerful, smart and determined to win this audacious power grab.* Nicolas Wright (Lots of TV) provides delicious bits of humor as Donnie the Guide, a gabby fellow who leads White House tours.Despite over-the-top violence, we enjoy little bits of humor and appreciate the in-depth tour of the White House.

1600489,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B009NNMAZI,Mark Turner,"[2, 2]","Every once in a while it seems that Hollywood gets more than one movie based on the same idea produced. Coincidence? Chances are but it always seems odd when they come out at nearly the same time. The good news happens when both movies are actually well made and enjoyable. The bad news is when the second doesn't quite match up to the first. This is the case with WHITE HOUSE DOWN, a movie that is quite enjoyable on it's own but doesn't quite compare to the earlier released OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN.WHITE HOUSE DOWN features Channing Tatum as John Cale, a D.C. policeman assigned to the protection of the Speaker of the House (Richard Jenkins). Divorced Cale is the typical absent father who is trying to get back in his daughters good graces.  Not an easy task seeing as how she's your typical pre-teen. When he tells her he has an interview to be a Secret Service agent working at the White House her attitude changes. She's a political junkie, especially when it comes to the home of the President.Two other main characters come in to play about this time. Jamie Foxx is President Sawyer, determined to provide peace in the Middle East. He's just announced plans to bring every single military person back from that location to do so, something that doesn't sit well with the military industrial complex. The second person of interest is Secret Service agent Walker (James Woods). It's his last few days and Walker is set to retire. But something doesn't seem quite right with him.Cale's interview doesn't go near as well as he had planned, especially since the person in charge of hiring him is agent Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal) an ex-flame of sorts from his college days. Knowing him for the goof that he was then as well as noting his penchant for not following orders (even though he's a decorated war hero), she passes. Rather than let his daughter know, he instead takes her on a tour of the White House while they're there.It's at this time that a group of mercenaries explode a bomb at the Capitol, bringing down the famous dome. But this is just a distraction. Their real intent is to capture the White House and the President. For ransom or for some other nefarious reason? All is revealed as the film moves forward and as the traitor in the White House is revealed.Separated from his daughter since she went to use the rest room, Cale sets out to find her before harm can come to her. Along the way he rescues the President and sets up communication with the outside. His first priority is supposed to be Sawyer and for the most part he follows this. But his daughter takes precedence when push comes to shove. Even the President agrees. A fight for the White House and control of the country follows in the building as well as outside. It isn't until late into the film that the reason for this whole take over is brought out into the open and before that happens plenty of explosions and gunfire takes place.The good parts of the movie are the action sequences, all of which are well staged and set up. The acting is nothing outstanding but is well done. The bad parts are those that seem completely unreal. To think that removing all troops from the Middle East will result in peace is the first item on hand. The President choosing to run around the White House in Air Jordans (which leads to a joke) is another. And worst of all is the attempt to take something which should be a serious matter and trying to turn it into a buddy cop flick with lots of in jokes and offhand comments. It doesn't work.OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN took the material seriously and not only played at your patriotic heartstrings but got you involved in the story. You wanted to get the bad guys and reclaim the country. This film tends to take the Hollywood notion that right wing fanatics want to blow up the world and that just by being nice the world will become a better place. I'd say that's a bit of a stretch of the imagination. The movie does offer a nice piece of entertainment but compared to the earlier film using the same backdrop it falls far short of being something worth watching several times. In the end it might be worth watching but maybe not owning.",3,WHITE HOUSE ATTACKED...AGAIN,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,4157,"['once', 'while', 'Hollywood', 'more', 'one', 'movie', 'based', 'same', 'idea', 'produced', 'Coincidence', 'Chances', 'are', 'always', 'odd', 'when', 'come', 'out', 'nearly', 'same', 'time', 'good', 'news', 'happens', 'when', 'movies', 'are', 'actually', 'well', 'made', 'enjoyable', 'bad', 'news', 'when', 'second', ""n't"", 'quite', 'match', 'up', 'first', 'case', 'WHITE', 'HOUSE', 'DOWN', 'movie', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'own', ""n't"", 'quite', 'compare', 'earlier', 'released', 'OLYMPUS', 'HAS', 'FALLEN.WHITE', 'HOUSE', 'DOWN', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'John', 'Cale', 'D.C.', 'policeman', 'assigned', 'protection', 'Speaker', 'House', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Divorced', 'Cale', 'typical', 'absent', 'father', 'who', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'daughters', 'good', 'graces', 'Not', 'easy', 'task', 'seeing', 'how', 'typical', 'pre-teen', 'When', 'interview', 'be', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'working', 'White', 'House', 'attitude', 'changes', 'political', 'junkie', 'especially', 'when', 'home', 'President.Two', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'come', 'play', 'time', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'President', 'Sawyer', 'determined', 'provide', 'peace', 'Middle', 'East', 'just', 'announced', 'plans', 'bring', 'single', 'military', 'person', 'back', 'location', 'do', 'so', 'something', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'military', 'industrial', 'complex', 'second', 'person', 'interest', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'Walker', 'James', 'Woods', 'last', 'few', 'days', 'Walker', 'set', 'retire', 'something', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'right', 'him.Cale', 'interview', ""n't"", 'go', 'near', 'as', 'well', 'had', 'planned', 'especially', 'person', 'charge', 'hiring', 'agent', 'Finnerty', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'ex-flame', 'sorts', 'college', 'days', 'Knowing', 'goof', 'was', 'then', 'as', 'well', 'noting', 'penchant', 'not', 'following', 'orders', 'even', 'decorated', 'war', 'hero', 'Rather', 'let', 'daughter', 'know', 'instead', 'tour', 'White', 'House', ""'re"", 'there.It', 'time', 'group', 'mercenaries', 'explode', 'bomb', 'Capitol', 'bringing', 'down', 'famous', 'dome', 'just', 'distraction', 'real', 'intent', 'capture', 'White', 'House', 'President', 'ransom', 'other', 'nefarious', 'reason', 'revealed', 'film', 'forward', 'traitor', 'White', 'House', 'revealed.Separated', 'daughter', 'went', 'use', 'rest', 'room', 'Cale', 'out', 'find', 'harm', 'can', 'come', 'way', 'President', 'up', 'communication', 'outside', 'first', 'priority', 'supposed', 'be', 'Sawyer', 'most', 'part', 'daughter', 'precedence', 'when', 'push', 'shove', 'Even', 'President', 'fight', 'White', 'House', 'control', 'country', 'building', 'as', 'well', 'outside', ""n't"", 'late', 'film', 'reason', 'whole', 'take', 'over', 'brought', 'out', 'open', 'plenty', 'explosions', 'gunfire', 'place.The', 'good', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'well', 'staged', 'set', 'up', 'acting', 'nothing', 'outstanding', 'well', 'done', 'bad', 'parts', 'are', 'seem', 'completely', 'unreal', 'think', 'removing', 'troops', 'Middle', 'East', 'will', 'result', 'peace', 'first', 'item', 'hand', 'President', 'choosing', 'run', 'around', 'White', 'House', 'Air', 'Jordans', 'joke', 'worst', 'attempt', 'take', 'something', 'should', 'be', 'serious', 'matter', 'trying', 'turn', 'buddy', 'cop', 'flick', 'lots', 'jokes', 'offhand', 'comments', ""n't"", 'work.OLYMPUS', 'HAS', 'FALLEN', 'took', 'material', 'seriously', 'not', 'only', 'played', 'patriotic', 'heartstrings', 'got', 'involved', 'story', 'wanted', 'get', 'bad', 'guys', 'reclaim', 'country', 'film', 'take', 'Hollywood', 'notion', 'right', 'wing', 'fanatics', 'want', 'blow', 'up', 'world', 'just', 'being', 'nice', 'world', 'will', 'become', 'better', 'place', ""'d"", 'say', 'bit', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'movie', 'offer', 'nice', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'compared', 'earlier', 'film', 'using', 'same', 'backdrop', 'far', 'short', 'being', 'something', 'worth', 'watching', 'several', 'times', 'end', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'maybe', 'not', 'owning']",White House Down

1600500,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B009NNMAZI,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","Director Roland Emmerich follows the same successful formula he used for his much better ""Independence Day"" in this much too long action based political thriller.  Keeping up with the times, President James Sawyer is played by Jamie Foxx.  Sawyer is under political fire for reaching a peace arrangement with Iran and plans to withdraw troops throughout the Middle East and other parts of the world.  Little does he know that a coup is underway within the government.  Gee, what a new idea.Channing Tatum plays Cale, a cop in the Capitol police force and spends most of his time driving Speaker of the House Raphelson (Richard Jenkins) around.  It seems Cale, once an active duty Marine, saved Raphelson's son from being killed in Afghanistan.  But Cale, a one-time college dropout and all around goof off, wants more.  Specifically he wants a job with the Secret Service White House detail.And of course he has disappointed his cute, precocious 11 year old daughter Emily who lives with her mother.  Played by Joey King, Emily is one of the better characters in this movie.  She isn't just along for the ride, but gets in on the action in a realistic way when things start to fall apart.  Although, Cale's interview with the Secret Service agent in charge (Maggie Gyllenhaal) doesn't go well (they are former classmates with a history), Cale gets on the good side of his daughter by getting passes for a White House tour.Things go haywire when the White House is infiltrated by a goon squad of right wing rednecks, a creepy brainiac geek and a former Army Ranger, all being orchestrated by a powerful insider.  Duh.  The bad guys slaughter everyone paid to protect the building with ease but in a PG-13 sort of way.  You can pretty much guess where this is all going.  Cale and Emily get separated.  The bad guys can't seem to get their automatic, fast firing weapons to hit Cale.  They obviously haven't learned how to lead when firing at someone running or else have set their bullets on slow motion.In any case Cale manages to get to the president (remember him) before he is taken prisoner.  The bad guys need him alive for negotiating purposes.  While there is no question how this will all end, there is a certain amount of tension involved in the film, as unbelievable as the whole plot is.This film was originally released in June of 2013, a month or two after a very similar film called ""Olympus Has Fallen"" came out with Gerard Butler in a Cale-like role.  Instead of a daughter, he had a son, who was also in the White House when it was captured.  By North Koreans rather than money hungry American discontents and political rivals.  ""White House Down"" is full of wise cracks along the way, mostly by Foxx and Tatum and a tour guide played by Nicolas Wright.  ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is marginally better in my mind because of Butler.  He's deadly serious.As flawed as the movie is, the Blu ray transfer is picture perfect in every way.  The transfer is in 1080p and has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Every scene looks glorious with rich detail, great colors and natural textures.  Skin tones are natural.  Dark scenes look very good with deep black.  Demo grade throughout.  So much so that some of the CGI effects in the film are almost laughable.  The audio track, likewise is demo grade.  The disc uses a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track that is spectacular.  While the gun battles get old, there is no question that the viewer is in on the action.  There are numerous scenes with helicopters, jets, tanks, rocket launchers throughout and the sound is perfectly displayed in the surrounds.  Quieter scenes are also well done.  Some of the spaces in the White House are abandon, so small sounds echo off the walls.  Dialog is clear and concise.  Really well done sonics.  There is a whole list of subtitle options, too numerous to mention here.  There are the extras which are likewise plentiful:A Dynamic DuoMen of ActionRoland Emmerich - Upping the AnteMeet the InsidersPreviewsExclusive HD Content:Gag ReelCrashing the Oval OfficeDrowning the BeastRecreating the White HouseThe BeastThe Full ArsenalVFX Boundaries DownThe Inside StoryPresidential TreatmentLights, Camera, Heart-Pumping Action",2,(BLU RAY REVIEW) 2 1/2 stars for another destruction of the White House,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,4198,"['Director', 'Roland', 'Emmerich', 'same', 'successful', 'formula', 'used', 'much', 'better', 'Independence', 'Day', 'much', 'too', 'long', 'action', 'based', 'political', 'thriller', 'Keeping', 'up', 'times', 'President', 'James', 'Sawyer', 'played', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Sawyer', 'political', 'fire', 'reaching', 'peace', 'arrangement', 'Iran', 'plans', 'withdraw', 'troops', 'Middle', 'East', 'other', 'parts', 'world', 'Little', 'know', 'coup', 'underway', 'government', 'Gee', 'what', 'new', 'idea.Channing', 'Tatum', 'Cale', 'cop', 'Capitol', 'police', 'force', 'most', 'time', 'driving', 'Speaker', 'House', 'Raphelson', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Cale', 'once', 'active', 'duty', 'Marine', 'saved', 'Raphelson', 'son', 'being', 'killed', 'Afghanistan', 'Cale', 'one-time', 'college', 'dropout', 'goof', 'more', 'Specifically', 'job', 'Secret', 'Service', 'White', 'House', 'detail.And', 'course', 'disappointed', 'cute', 'precocious', '11', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Emily', 'who', 'mother', 'Played', 'Joey', 'King', 'Emily', 'one', 'better', 'characters', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'along', 'ride', 'action', 'realistic', 'way', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'fall', 'apart', 'Cale', 'interview', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'charge', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'are', 'former', 'classmates', 'history', 'Cale', 'good', 'side', 'daughter', 'getting', 'passes', 'White', 'House', 'tour.Things', 'go', 'haywire', 'when', 'White', 'House', 'infiltrated', 'goon', 'squad', 'right', 'wing', 'rednecks', 'creepy', 'brainiac', 'geek', 'former', 'Army', 'Ranger', 'being', 'orchestrated', 'powerful', 'insider', 'Duh', 'bad', 'guys', 'slaughter', 'everyone', 'paid', 'protect', 'building', 'ease', 'PG-13', 'sort', 'way', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guess', 'where', 'going', 'Cale', 'Emily', 'get', 'separated', 'bad', 'guys', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'automatic', 'fast', 'firing', 'weapons', 'hit', 'Cale', 'obviously', 'have', ""n't"", 'learned', 'how', 'lead', 'when', 'firing', 'someone', 'running', 'else', 'have', 'set', 'bullets', 'slow', 'motion.In', 'case', 'Cale', 'get', 'president', 'remember', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'bad', 'guys', 'need', 'alive', 'negotiating', 'purposes', 'question', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'certain', 'amount', 'tension', 'involved', 'film', 'as', 'unbelievable', 'whole', 'plot', 'is.This', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'June', '2013', 'month', 'two', 'very', 'similar', 'film', 'called', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'came', 'out', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Cale-like', 'role', 'Instead', 'daughter', 'had', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'White', 'House', 'when', 'was', 'captured', 'North', 'Koreans', 'rather', 'money', 'hungry', 'American', 'discontents', 'political', 'rivals', 'White', 'House', 'Down', 'full', 'wise', 'cracks', 'way', 'mostly', 'Foxx', 'Tatum', 'tour', 'guide', 'played', 'Nicolas', 'Wright', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'marginally', 'better', 'mind', 'Butler', 'deadly', 'serious.As', 'flawed', 'movie', 'Blu', 'ray', 'transfer', 'picture', 'perfect', 'way', 'transfer', '1080p', '2.40:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'scene', 'glorious', 'rich', 'detail', 'great', 'colors', 'natural', 'textures', 'Skin', 'tones', 'are', 'natural', 'Dark', 'scenes', 'look', 'very', 'good', 'deep', 'black', 'Demo', 'grade', 'So', 'much', 'CGI', 'effects', 'film', 'are', 'almost', 'laughable', 'audio', 'track', 'likewise', 'demo', 'grade', 'disc', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'track', 'spectacular', 'gun', 'get', 'old', 'question', 'viewer', 'action', 'are', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'helicopters', 'jets', 'tanks', 'rocket', 'launchers', 'sound', 'perfectly', 'displayed', 'surrounds', 'Quieter', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'spaces', 'White', 'House', 'are', 'abandon', 'so', 'small', 'sounds', 'echo', 'walls', 'Dialog', 'clear', 'concise', 'Really', 'well', 'done', 'sonics', 'whole', 'list', 'subtitle', 'options', 'too', 'numerous', 'mention', 'here', 'are', 'extras', 'are', 'likewise', 'plentiful', 'Dynamic', 'DuoMen', 'ActionRoland', 'Emmerich', 'Upping', 'AnteMeet', 'InsidersPreviewsExclusive', 'HD', 'Content', 'Gag', 'ReelCrashing', 'Oval', 'OfficeDrowning', 'BeastRecreating', 'White', 'HouseThe', 'BeastThe', 'Full', 'ArsenalVFX', 'Boundaries', 'DownThe', 'Inside', 'StoryPresidential', 'TreatmentLights', 'Camera', 'Heart-Pumping', 'Action']",White House Down

1600506,A3M3X0BDWGT4D7,B009NNMAZI,Outdoors Survival Guy,"[0, 0]","Before I begin, let me say that I am NOT a movie snob. I enjoy Michael Bay films and Steven Seagal flicks. I am happy to suspend disbelief in the name of fantasy. However, some movies just push the envelope until it becomes too ridiculous to watch. &#34;White House Down&#34; is one of those films.The first major flaw of the film is that the script writers borrow too heavily from other material. They basically took the scripts from the Die Hard franchise and &#34;Air Force One&#34; and merged them all together.Secondly, every action film clich&eacute; is represented: an unexpected hero throws a monkey wrench into bad guys' plans, an inside traitor compromises security and opens the door for a takeover, a bunch of mercenaries who look like meth dealers, a bumbling group of government bureaucrats, a brainiac techno geek working for the bad guys, the hero's loved one is one of the hostages, etc. You could go on for hours.The third issue is that when your setting and characters are based on real elements, you have to keep a certain level of realism. This movie fails to do that on all levels. America's nuclear arsenal is not like Skynet from &#34;The Terminator&#34;.  The President cannot arm and launch ballistic missiles from a terminal. Everyone knows that the weapons system is set up so that no one person can unilaterally deploy a nuclear weapon. It's also hard to believe that after the Cold War and 9/11 our government would not have contingency plans to deal with such a scenario.The plot keeps becoming more unbelievable until it ventures into absurdity. The film almost becomes a comedic parody of itself and other action movies. The climax when the hero crashes an SUV into the Oval Office and mows down the bad guy with a cannon is the icing on the cake. Bottom line: Fiction is acceptable, but excessive plots sometimes reach a breaking point with the audience.",2,Excessive to the point of absurdity.,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,1888,"['begin', 'let', 'say', 'am', 'NOT', 'movie', 'snob', 'enjoy', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'films', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'flicks', 'am', 'happy', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'name', 'fantasy', 'However', 'movies', 'just', 'push', 'envelope', 'too', 'ridiculous', 'watch', '34', 'White', 'House', 'Down', '34', 'one', 'films.The', 'first', 'major', 'flaw', 'film', 'script', 'writers', 'borrow', 'too', 'heavily', 'other', 'material', 'basically', 'took', 'scripts', 'Die', 'Hard', 'franchise', '34', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', '34', 'merged', 'together.Secondly', 'action', 'film', 'clich', 'eacute', 'represented', 'unexpected', 'hero', 'monkey', 'wrench', 'bad', 'guys', 'plans', 'inside', 'traitor', 'compromises', 'security', 'door', 'takeover', 'bunch', 'mercenaries', 'who', 'look', 'meth', 'dealers', 'bumbling', 'group', 'government', 'bureaucrats', 'brainiac', 'techno', 'geek', 'working', 'bad', 'guys', 'hero', 'loved', 'one', 'one', 'hostages', 'etc', 'could', 'go', 'hours.The', 'third', 'issue', 'when', 'setting', 'characters', 'are', 'based', 'real', 'elements', 'have', 'keep', 'certain', 'level', 'realism', 'movie', 'do', 'levels', 'America', 'nuclear', 'arsenal', 'not', 'like', 'Skynet', '34', 'Terminator', '34', 'President', 'can', 'not', 'arm', 'launch', 'ballistic', 'missiles', 'terminal', 'Everyone', 'weapons', 'system', 'set', 'up', 'one', 'person', 'can', 'unilaterally', 'deploy', 'nuclear', 'weapon', 'also', 'hard', 'believe', 'Cold', 'War', '9/11', 'government', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'contingency', 'plans', 'deal', 'scenario.The', 'plot', 'becoming', 'more', 'unbelievable', 'ventures', 'absurdity', 'film', 'almost', 'comedic', 'parody', 'other', 'action', 'movies', 'climax', 'when', 'hero', 'crashes', 'SUV', 'Oval', 'Office', 'down', 'bad', 'guy', 'cannon', 'icing', 'cake', 'Bottom', 'line', 'Fiction', 'acceptable', 'excessive', 'plots', 'sometimes', 'reach', 'breaking', 'point', 'audience']",White House Down

I had tickets for both World War Z and White House Down this week but, I knew I could only go to one so I played the odds and managed to get in on the showing.Let me say that this is a Hollywood propaganda piece for sure and yes it mostly tries to paint the Right Wing as a war machine run by Radicals who sleep with their guns.  Honestly, I'm neither a Republican nor a Democrat and I have yet to actually cast my vote for a man whose won the white house (yes I seem to have bet on guys that didn't win) but, I go to movies for an escape from reality and Hollyweird needs to get away from the political BS.Okay, with all that out of the way, John Cale (Played by Channing Tatum) is a man on security detail for the Speaker of the House and he's trying to get back into his daughter's life while interviewing for a job in the Secret Service.  One thing leads to another and he doesn't get the job but, ends up taking his daughter on a tour of the white house.  Well, an extremist group sets into motion a distraction at the capital building that has everybody looking that way while the head of security at the WhiteHouse sets a plan in motion to eliminate the Anti-War President (played by Jamie Foxx and there's more to it than that but, you can find that out by seeing the movie).  Well, somehow John Cale ends up the being the only man that stands between the extremists and the president and he gets to do an on the Job interview that is as enjoyable, sometimes hilarious, and action packed as any movie in recent years.Let me just say, this really is Die Hard for the new generation, it is a throw back to when movies were movies and they did an excellent job with the story and production in spite of the political skewing.  I honestly feel there's only one other movie I enjoyed this much in 2013 and that was Star Trek Into Darkness so, it really shows you how highly I think of this movie as the Star Trek was easily my favorite movie of the year.Overall, I would give it 5 stars but, I had to take it down a peg for ruining my entertainment with politics.

All acting, props, wardrobe, make-up, and (Top) level CGI effects are stunning. Beautiful and shockingly crisp picturesque cinematography.  The storyline and character development between all main characters is amazing. This movie takes you on an emotional roller-coaster ride of betrayal, manipulation, and deception. This movie is gripping, with cut throat (balls-to-wall) hardcore fights, blood and gore, gun battles, and some serious carnage. (A-list) actors Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum carried this movie well and both work very well together. Both actors demonstrate their amazing acting ability and diversification.

If it wasn't incredibly obvious from the previews this is another PG-13 Die Hard with a different protagonist.

It's smartly written, well-acted, and entertaining from beginning to end. Is it ridiculous? Absolutely. Is it silly? Very. It's absolutely what you want and expect from a Die Hard movie. It's also the most likable Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx have ever been in my opinion (yes, I actually sat through Step Up, She's the Man, Ray, and Stealth, slightly more traumatized with each new film).If you are expecting Independence Day or Stargate levels of over-the-top sci-fi battle-royale-with-cheese you will be disappointed. If you just want a rollicking good time with a Die Hard flick set in the White House you're probably going to love this movie. It doesn't have a SINGLE annoying character and I actually laughed at the jokes. The performances by the superb cast are uniformly excellent.

1600530,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B009NNMAZI,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[36, 55]","This summer has had some hits, but it will most likely be remembered for a string of high-profile box office bombs featuring highly-paid stars who usually deliver better films and better box-office. The string of bombs continues with ""White House Down"", the latest Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"", ""2012"") film starring Channing Tatum as Capitol policeman John Cale and Jamie Foxx as President Sawyer.Emmerich has created an impressive number of very successful summer popcorn films; he isn't trying to make Oscar winners, he is trying to elevate the B movie to an art form. With each new film, he combines wholly improbably plots with corny acting and over-the-top special effects. And it usually works; just the type of thing to spend a couple of hours escaping the hot summer sun while enjoying big handfuls of popcorn and soda.But ""White House Down"" doesn't. And there are a number of reasons why.Some people are pointing to the March release of ""Olympus Has Fallen"", a film with a very similar narrative. Every time two different studios decide to release similar films they always end up in a pissing match. Who will be first? Who gets the prime release date? Who has the bigger stars? But ultimately, none of this matters. ""Olympus Has Fallen"" doesn't have the star power of the more recent Emmerich film. But ""Fallen"" had a lower budget and made money. The last time two studios competed, they jockeyed for position and ""Mirror, Mirror"", a terrible film starring Julia Roberts, was released first and flopped badly. A few months later, ""Snow White and the Huntsmen"", a marginally better film, made enough money to warrant a sequel. The lesson learned? Star power and release date don't matter. If ""White House Down"" were a better film, no one would remember or care about ""Olympus Has Fallen"".The key mistake in ""White House"" is that everyone takes everything so seriously. It's a preposterous story and there needs to be a certain amount of wink-wink. All of the best examples of this genre (""Die Hard"", ""Lethal Weapon"") include humor, one-liners and funny tag lines.Cale is desperate to become a member of the Secret Service and has an interview with Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the newly appointed head of the President's security detail. She is replacing Walker (James Woods) who is retiring. Cale brings his daughter Emily (Joey King) to the White House, because she is a history freak and he needs to earn some Daddy points. The interview doesn't go well and Cale decides to put on a happy face for his daughter who urges him to join a tour of the White House. During this time, a group or mercenaries, led by Stenz (Jason Clarke, ""The Great Gatsby"", ""Lawless"") infiltrates the White House and begins to fire bullets, taking control. Cale realizes someone needs to protect the President and the two men quickly elude the terrorists. Little Emily, in the bathroom when the attack begins, can't be discounted and will play a role in the drama.During the course of the film, Cale will grow and become a hero. That is pretty much a given and something that should not come as a surprise to anyone. But Tatum who let's face it is pretty but not a good actor, fails to give the character anything very deep. I know we are talking about a summer popcorn film, but when the lead character seems to be following instructions, moving from one point to the other with no obvious thought behind the movements, it is difficult to get behind the hero, to feel anything for him. Tatum always seems robotic during his dramatic moments, delivering his lines in a stiff, stilted manner.Jamie Foxx is okay as President Sawyer. He has done better work in the past, but in ""White House Down"", he manages to display a little of the charisma and bravado he is known for. These qualities make him believable, as much as any character in a film like this is believable, as the Commander In Chief. He also has one or two funny lines, the only funny lines, which help make the film a little more enjoyable.As the drama continues, various government officials, led by Finnerty and Raphelson (Richard Jenkins) watch from a command center, trying to coordinate the rescue efforts and save the government. Moments on Air Force Two and surveillance video help them watch the drama unfold.But it is up to Cale to save the President, his daughter and the country.I think I was most disappointed by the lack of originality in just about every aspect of the narrative and filmmaking. It is an extremely predictable movie. Early on, you realize everything will be the opposite at the end of the film. When this realization occurs, nothing surprises you. Early on, Cale has an argument with his ex-wife (Rachel LeFevre, TV's ""Under the Dome"", ""Twilight"") because he missed Emily's school talent show. ""What did she do?"" ""Flag twirling..."" ""That's a talent?"" Every `big moment', a moment meant to deliver a lot of emotional or dramatic impact is telegraphed in a none too subtle fashion. This means that as soon as you hear this exchange about flag twirling, you know it will lead to a scene of the daughter using this very skill for a big dramatic payoff. However, even more shocking is how much of a blatant rip-off this moment is, borrowing everything practically verbatim from Michael Bay's ""The Rock"". Because it is such a blatant rip-off, any drama is robbed from the moment and it is ultimately a waste of time.As soon as Cale and President Sawyer get together, they begin to reenact various parts of ""Die Hard"". Unfortunately, the villains aren't memorable and draw attention to the actions of the heroes, giving everything a ""been there, done that"" feeling. Jason Clarke, who was on the short-lived television series ""The Chicago Code"" is working his way up the Hollywood ladder, doing supporting roles in high-profile films. He played virtually the same character in both ""The Great Gatsby"" and ""Lawless"" - an adult male with no control over his destiny who becomes a victim of others, so his role here is a bit different. But he doesn't stand out for any reason. One of his cohorts, a computer hacker played by Jimmi Simpson (TV's ""Breakout Kings"", ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"") chews up the scenery, but his purpose is never very clear.James Woods plays Walker, the former head of the President's security detail. He has an ax to grind and this propels a lot of the action in the film.Roland Emmerich has created imaginative, albeit over-the-top films, which always serve to entertain the audience. But something went wrong with ""White House Down"" it doesn't have the imagination, the power, the outlandish qualities of his other films. It is simply a forgettable film.

Here comes the other one with a more straightforward title. ""White House Down"" is directed by none other than Roland Emmerich, someone best known for sci-fi action ""Independence Day."" Like all of his action films in the past, ""White House Down"" is entertaining in its own way, with a fair amount of CGI-enhanced action, but ends up with something turgid and overblown, even for the genre.This is a traditional template of action movies. Channing Tatum's hero John Cale, a capitol policeman who happens to be inside the White House with his daughter Emily (Joey King) for job interview, saves the President Sawyer played by Jamie Foxx, when it is attacked and taken over by a group of terrorists. The situation seems pretty incredible, but still serviceable enough as the premise for yet another ""Die Hard""-inspired action movie.Sadly Roland Emmerich just cannot stop adding things unnecessary to the already bloated storyline. International politics, YouTube images, John Cale's past marriage, etc. Everything slows down the movie, sometimes forgetting Channing Tatum's hero, who should be at the center of the story.To his credit, Mr. Emmerich did a decent job in creating action sequences, even though they tend to be overlong and repetitious (script by James Vanderbilt of ""Zodiac"" fame). I know I shouldn't take the film too seriously and I confess I enjoyed watching the film pretty much, but also couldn't help think that his latest film was a typical case of less is better than more.",3,"Yet Another ""Die Hard""-Inspired Action from the Director of ""Independence Day""",1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,1615,"['second', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'White', 'House', 'siege', 'year', 'screen', 'first', 'being', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'Here', 'other', 'one', 'more', 'straightforward', 'title', 'White', 'House', 'Down', 'directed', 'none', 'other', 'Roland', 'Emmerich', 'someone', 'best', 'known', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'Independence', 'Day', 'action', 'films', 'past', 'White', 'House', 'Down', 'entertaining', 'own', 'way', 'fair', 'amount', 'CGI-enhanced', 'action', 'up', 'something', 'turgid', 'overblown', 'even', 'genre.This', 'traditional', 'template', 'action', 'movies', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'hero', 'John', 'Cale', 'capitol', 'policeman', 'who', 'be', 'White', 'House', 'daughter', 'Emily', 'Joey', 'King', 'job', 'interview', 'President', 'Sawyer', 'played', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'when', 'attacked', 'taken', 'over', 'group', 'terrorists', 'situation', 'pretty', 'incredible', 'still', 'serviceable', 'enough', 'premise', 'yet', 'Die', 'Hard', '-inspired', 'action', 'movie.Sadly', 'Roland', 'Emmerich', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'adding', 'things', 'unnecessary', 'already', 'bloated', 'storyline', 'International', 'politics', 'YouTube', 'John', 'Cale', 'past', 'marriage', 'etc', 'Everything', 'down', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'forgetting', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'hero', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'center', 'story.To', 'credit', 'Mr.', 'Emmerich', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'creating', 'action', 'sequences', 'even', 'tend', 'be', 'overlong', 'repetitious', 'script', 'James', 'Vanderbilt', 'Zodiac', 'fame', 'know', 'should', ""n't"", 'take', 'film', 'too', 'seriously', 'confess', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'also', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'latest', 'film', 'was', 'typical', 'case', 'less', 'better', 'more']",White House Down
