1414232,A17S1450Y06C86,B004LWZVZC,Aidan J. McQuade,"[3, 3]","This film barely made it to cinema release in the UK and despite having a sterling cast and a director in Robert Redford seems to have received little attention generally on the eastern side of the Atlantic.Redford has always been a politically engaged individual who has made political films. He showed with the exquiste ""A river runs through it"" that he was confident enough with a story to take his time with it, and with the, in my view, very underrated ""Lions for lambs"" that he was not afraid of making films about ideas that also discuss ideas in some detail.These elements are drawn together in this movie which explores a dark coda to the Lincoln assasination: the military tribunal which tried the conspirators. The film focuses upon Fredrick Aiken, a former Union officer and lawyer, who is drawn, rather against his will, into defending one of the alleged conspirators, Mary Surrat, the owner of the boarding house where John Wilkes Booth met with his co-conspirators.This facinating story is not well known, and Redford has drawn from it clear parallels with some of the contemporary abuses of American power that wartime has brought.I think James McAvoy is one of the most exciting actors alive and here he delivers one of his trademark ham-free performances as Aiken. The rest of the international cast delivers fine support, particularly the great Kevin Kline, brilliantly convincing as Edwin Stanton, the War Secretary, whose single-mindedness in prosecuting the war to preserve the Union threatens the very principles of the Union in the absence of Lincoln's wise authority.In summary this is a thoughtful, tense and at times very moving courtroom and civil war drama that celebrates moral courage where others have focussed on the physical variety.

But also, according to this Robert Redford -directed first film in the American Film Company production line, the prevailing atmosphere on the Union side, political, legal and military around those who conspired to kill Abraham Lincoln (and Vice-President Johnson and Secretary Of State Seward) along with John Wilkes Booth. The film centers on the pre-trial and trial events of the only woman brought to trial in the conspiracy (it was at her boarding house where conspiracy was advanced), Mary E. Surratt who was tried before a Union Army military commission, and eventually the first woman hanged by the federal government, for her part in the conspiracy.We all, those of us who revere the historic memory of Abraham Lincoln, are glad, glad as hell that the south and slavery were defeated. We are nevertheless as supporters of democratic rights now (and hopefully back then, as well) concerned about the modern day issues that this film brings out whether we are sympathetic to Mary Surratt's plight (or those of today's political  prisoners).

1414240,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B004LWZVZC,Andrew Desmond,"[1, 3]","""The Conspirator"" covers an event little known to most Americans.  That is, the trial of Mary Suratt for allegedly conspiring in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and the attempted assassinations of Andrew Johnson (Vice President) and William Seward (Secretary of Sate).  All are to some degree aware of Lincoln's demise.  Few would have any knowledge of the broader conspiracy.Robert Redford is to be commended for bringing this story to a wider audience. However, as with much of Redford's work, there is broader underlying theme.  In this case, it is the use of almost summary justice whereby individuals can be tried before a military commission rather than a jury of their peers.  For Mary Suratt, it was almost as if the result had been pre-determined.  The North was in a vengeful mood and nothing was going to stop Mary Suratt from being found guilty.  She was never to be allowed a fair trial.The obvious analogy being worked here is the current events in Guantanomo Bay.  Detainees have been held for years without any real prospect of facing a fair trial.  Justice has been allowed to take a back seat to revenge.  This is a shame.  America is better than this and herein lies Redford's point.  Liberty must always trump fear.""The Conspirator"" is good without being great.  It is skillfully made and never fails to grab the viewer's attention.  If I was to find criticism, it is that Redford can sometimes try a bit too hard.  Has he allowed the Suratt story to become just a bit too concocted in the process of making a political point?  Arguably, yes.  Nonetheless, the story never fails to captivate.",4,War Has Many Victims,1312243200,"08 2, 2011",2011,1617,"['Conspirator', 'event', 'little', 'known', 'most', 'Americans', 'trial', 'Mary', 'Suratt', 'allegedly', 'conspiring', 'assassination', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'attempted', 'assassinations', 'Andrew', 'Johnson', 'Vice', 'President', 'William', 'Seward', 'Secretary', 'Sate', 'are', 'degree', 'aware', 'Lincoln', 'demise', 'Few', 'would', 'have', 'knowledge', 'broader', 'conspiracy.Robert', 'Redford', 'be', 'commended', 'bringing', 'story', 'wider', 'audience', 'However', 'much', 'Redford', 'work', 'broader', 'underlying', 'theme', 'case', 'use', 'almost', 'summary', 'justice', 'whereby', 'individuals', 'can', 'be', 'tried', 'military', 'commission', 'rather', 'jury', 'peers', 'Mary', 'Suratt', 'was', 'almost', 'result', 'had', 'been', 'pre-determined', 'North', 'was', 'vengeful', 'mood', 'nothing', 'was', 'going', 'stop', 'Mary', 'Suratt', 'being', 'found', 'guilty', 'was', 'never', 'be', 'allowed', 'fair', 'trial.The', 'obvious', 'analogy', 'being', 'worked', 'here', 'current', 'events', 'Guantanomo', 'Bay', 'Detainees', 'have', 'been', 'held', 'years', 'real', 'prospect', 'facing', 'fair', 'trial', 'Justice', 'been', 'allowed', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'revenge', 'shame', 'America', 'better', 'herein', 'Redford', 'point', 'Liberty', 'must', 'always', 'trump', 'fear', 'Conspirator', 'good', 'being', 'great', 'skillfully', 'made', 'never', 'fails', 'grab', 'viewer', 'attention', 'was', 'find', 'criticism', 'Redford', 'can', 'sometimes', 'try', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'allowed', 'Suratt', 'story', 'become', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'concocted', 'process', 'making', 'political', 'point', 'Arguably', 'yes', 'Nonetheless', 'story', 'never', 'captivate']",N/A
1414241,A1DW4T4PR9P3ID,B004LWZVZC,A-Train,"[4, 7]","Here's a piece of history that's prime for the big screen.  'The Conspirator' offers a lot of promise, but this is a Robert Redford film afterall so why not have a little politicising with your movie enjoyment?  The truth is 'The Conspirator' isn't as heavy-handed as 'Lions for Lambs', but making connections to current events are none to subtle either.  The prisoners wear hoods in their jail cells (Guantanamo anyone?), while Kevin Kline's Secretary of War looks suspiciously (or not so much) like Donald Rumsfeld with a beard.  Oh well, if you can make it past the politics it's a fairly engaging story concentrating mostly on the trial of Mary Suratt while the actual assassination of President Lincoln is given about 10 minutes at the start of the film.Production-wise the film looks pretty good, although I did feel at times I was watching an A&E; dramatized documentary than an actual Hollywood movie.  The sets and costumes look fantastic.  And although I didn't particularly care for it, the decision to film using a soft, but washed-out style does give the film a certain rustic feel perfect for the movie's setting.  As far as the acting goes, Robin Wright is a standout in the role of Mary Suratt.  And it was good to see Stephen Root in a supporting role.  But James McAvoy who is a very fine actor was entirely miscast.  He delivers his lines with zero conviction -- perhaps concentrating more on his American accent than the emotion of his dialogue.Although 'The Conspirator' isn't a must-see, it's a serviceable movie about a certain piece of forgotten history.  Even those cautious about Redford's name attached should be able to get away with only a few eye-rolls.

It is a Historic, True account of what was behind the assination of President Lincoln. The fact that Mary Surrett was not proven guilty, in a Prejudice Court and Environment. The Constitution totally ignored by all those of the Prosecution, the fact that she was guilty before even being tried in a Military Court and not one by her Peers. The Secretary of War only interested in seeing someone ""pay"" for Lincoln's assination, innocent or guilty, man or woman. Others involved in the Conspiracy lied in court, or was not apprehended and got off scott free.  The DVD arrived in very good condition and well packed. Very good job, for the wrapping, sending and condition of items bought, is very important for the consumer. Thank you. I would recommend this movie to anyone who finds interest in our Country's history.Also, the true feelings of the Americans, both North and South towards one another. Much hurt, pain and grief from all. For the North continued for several decades to punish those who were on the Confederate side of the boundries of this country. They were even denied to have equal representation or anyone representing them in our National Government-Congress or House of Representatives, for a long time after the war ended.Abraham Lincoln knew the feelings and pain of the Northern and Southern people towards one another. He ""did not"" want the South punished for ""any reason"" after the war ended. He just wanted our country to be reunited, be civil and sypathtic to one another, so as to heal all the wounds from this horrible war. His full intentions was to reunify the United States of America. This is what he was fighting for. To once again see America reunited. But sadly it didn't happen that way, due to his death. This is quite evident and reveals it so much in this movie.A movie that every school child should see, or even adults, for it is a very sad part of our American Heritage and History. But the TRUTH, it reveals.Thank you to Robert Redford for bringing this very factual, moving, emotional and Historical movie for all Americans to see and experience. A great job very well done.I wonder if someday, someone like Mr. Redford, will make a historical movie, based entirely on facts, the truth of the John F. Kennedy Assination? Yes it is out there. For even today they (experts in many different fields) are still researching and revealing what took place. I will never live to see it, but maybe someday the whole truth will come out for Americans to know the Conspiracy that enveloped his murder.

1414257,ACJVGDN8G386P,B004LWZVZC,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[2, 3]","Those films concerning the darker sides of the human condition which often questions our prejudicial attitudes, those attitudes we assume to be unshakable, are often the most important but not always the most popular. ""The Conspirator"" certainly resides in this category, a very tough and brutal episode of post-Civil War northern justice which puts into question the idea ""the North"" were all heroes, and ""the South"" were all villains. The story concerns the federal case against Mary Surratt whose only crime may have been owning the boarding house where the conspirators against Abraham Lincoln met to plan for the president's assassination only days after Lee surrendered to Grant. The trial may have been dangerously close to a kangaroo court in which a guilty verdict was preordained before the beginning of the trial as a means to restore peace. The two prejudicial attitudes the movie questions are the oft-portrayed morality of the North as opposed to the South, and that people who are put on trial must be guilty of something. Law enforcement does often operate with political ends in mind over carrying out justice, which is simply the punishment of the guilty and the freedom of the innocent.In a sense, ""the Conspirator"" is about the post-Civil War legal system of the United States being ""on trial"". Secretary of War Stanton (played by Kevin Kline in one of his best performances) argues Surratt must be found guilty and condemned with the other conspirators as it will send a message of fear which will supposedly deter future conspirators and put a final end to all rebellion. The conspirators along with Surratt stand trial in a military tribunal, even though all are essentially civilians. However it appears there was really little or no evidence tying Surratt directly with the Lincoln assassination conspiracy. Her only crimes may have been knowing that some southerners were going to perpetrate some kind of crime, and these men were under her roof. Her other crime was she was a southern sympathizer, although based on historical evidence, the general consensus among scholars is she ultimately had nothing to do with it. Being a southern woman, the implication is the case against her is guilt by association.Robin Wright offers a tour-de-force Academy-Award-caliber performance as Mary Surratt, a rather emotionally detached southern sympathizer, which she most probably was. Rather than playing into our escapist notions of unfair justice by portraying her as a completely sympathetic, beautiful, kind and loving character who becomes a victim of vigilante justice, the film presents her almost indifferently, as a somber and joyless prisoner. James MacAvoy plays Frederick Aiken, an attorney who previously fought for the Union side of the American Civil War, who reluctantly takes her case. Both Surratt and Aiken seem to have mutual distrust of one another when the case begins, but gradually Aiken believes a gross miscarriage of justice may be taking place. Aiken finds his footing when he begins to believe the fight is for rights guaranteed by the US Constitution and not just for Surratt.Whether or not Surratt held onto to her southern leanings is not the point. The issue is whether or not a person should stand trial for a crime in which the evidence is largely associational and hearsay. And should the rule of law be compromised for the sake of other ends, such as for demonstrative purposes. Is the fact she owned a boarding house in which some conspirators met to perpetrate one of the most heinous of crimes in US history enough to hang her? She was accused of actively taking part in a conspiracy that led to the assassination of President Lincoln. Four others whose involvement was incidental at best, such as a Ford stage hand who had seen to Booth's horse being tethered on the fateful night, were sentenced to life in prison. John Surratt, Mary's son, may have had more knowledge of the conspiracy but remained in hiding during the trial. John Wilkes Booth who was ultimately responsible for Lincolin's death escaped the humiliation of trial and execution when he was killed by federal troops while on the run. The implication is the state department wanted a fourth conspirator, and Mary Surratt became the scape-goat for the fourth noose.Redford was asked in an interview if he thought Mary Surratt was guilty, and his response was that she probably knew something, which is essentially my own view. However, knowing bits and pieces about a possible act in the future is not the same as being directly involved. The historical evidence is clear that she was put on trial as a fellow conspirator, not for failing to report overhearing plans for criminal behavior. She could have been charged with misprision of felony, which is essentially failing to report evidence and/or knowledge of a crime to law enforcement when she learned that some of her boarders were contemplating criminal behavior. I believe even during the 19th century, withholding evidence was not a hanging offense. But the powers-that-be decided swift and brutal justice was necessary to end all contemplations of future conspiracy, and Mary Surratt was added to the list of conspirators. I wonder what Abraham Lincoln would have thought about these proceedings, and if he would have approved of the course of some of the trials. Based on what I know of Lincoln, and I'm no scholar, I would have to conclude he would have detested how these proceedings were conducted and at least altered their conduct if he had had the power to do so.",5,Dark Moment of US Justice Concerning the First Woman Execution -- Possibly Redford's Best Film Since Ordinary People,1312588800,"08 6, 2011",2011,5553,"['films', 'concerning', 'darker',

I've read this book and reviewed it here and had some issues with it, but generally I felt it managed to stay true to the story of what is normally referred to as the Lincoln Conspirators. Let me explain. While John Wilkes Booth is considered Lincoln's assasin, a group of men and one woman (Mrs. Mary Surratt) were implicated with helping Booth to execute Lincoln's murder. Booth was shot and killed at Garrett's barn in Virginia about 2 weeks or so after escaping the Capital and temporarily avoiding capture. As the government investigated the plot to kill Lincoln, several names came up of people who were complicite in achieving to kill Lincoln and effectively attempting to bring down the government. In some cases, it was easy to connect conspirators to specific acts. In the case of Mrs. Surratt, who claimed she had no knowledge of any plans, it was not that clearcut.For dramatic purposes, this film deals with the attempts of a young lawyer name Frederick Aitken who agrees to defend Mrs. Surratt. Surratt, while proclaiming innocence, does little to help in her own defense.I thought this movie was really quite good. I know it got a bad rap when it came out because it was described as 'too long' and 'slow moving', but I thought it did a wonderful job of tackling a complex story and reducing the issues involved to their basic state. I'm also a big fan of the Civil War so I was a natural audience for this movie.Aside from a compelling script, the cast was top notch and worked well off of one another. The film was beautifully photographed and conveyed the appearance of ca. 1865 Washington. In the end, it was up to the viewer to decide if Mrs. Surratt was guilty or innocent.",5,Great Adaptation Of A Somewhat Ambiguous Story,1315353600,"09 7, 2011",2011,1823,"['movie', 'based', 'Assassin', 'Accomplice', 'Mary', 'Surratt', 'Plot', 'Kill', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Kate', 'Clifford', 'Larson', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'reviewed', 'here', 'had', 'issues', 'generally', 'felt', 'managed', 'stay', 'true', 'story', 'what', 'normally', 'referred', 'Lincoln', 'Conspirators', 'Let', 'explain', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'considered', 'Lincoln', 'assasin', 'group', 'men', 'one', 'woman', 'Mrs.', 'Mary', 'Surratt', 'were', 'implicated', 'helping', 'Booth', 'execute', 'Lincoln', 'murder', 'Booth', 'was', 'shot', 'killed', 'Garrett', 'barn', 'Virginia', '2', 'weeks', 'so', 'escaping', 'Capital', 'temporarily', 'avoiding', 'capture', 'government', 'investigated', 'plot', 'kill', 'Lincoln', 'several', 'names', 'came', 'up', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'complicite', 'achieving', 'kill', 'Lincoln', 'effectively', 'attempting', 'bring', 'down', 'government', 'cases', 'was', 'easy', 'connect', 'conspirators', 'specific', 'acts', 'case', 'Mrs.', 'Surratt', 'who', 'claimed', 'had', 'knowledge', 'plans', 'was', 'not', 'clearcut.For', 'dramatic', 'purposes', 'film', 'attempts', 'young', 'lawyer', 'name', 'Frederick', 'Aitken', 'who', 'defend', 'Mrs.', 'Surratt', 'Surratt', 'proclaiming', 'innocence', 'little', 'help', 'own', 'defense.I', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'know', 'got', 'bad', 'rap', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'described', ""'too"", 'long', 'moving', 'thought', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'tackling', 'complex', 'story', 'reducing', 'issues', 'involved', 'basic', 'state', ""'m"", 'also', 'big', 'fan', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'natural', 'audience', 'movie.Aside', 'compelling', 'script', 'cast', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'worked', 'well', 'one', 'film', 'was', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'conveyed', 'appearance', 'ca', '1865', 'Washington', 'end', 'was', 'up', 'viewer', 'decide', 'Mrs.', 'Surratt', 'was', 'guilty', 'innocent']",N/A

1414263,A3OW735Y4OO004,B004LWZVZC,Darrell Criswell,"[8, 12]","They took a great story and turned it into a medicore movie.First there are tons of historical inaccuracies, for some reason this movie supports the old confederate myth that Mary Surratt was hanged because of the rage of the North over Lincoln's killing and was innocent.  Read the excellent books American Brutus, Blood on the Moon, or Manhunt and you will get a much clearer idea of her role in the conspiracy which was considerable.  She blatantly lied to the detectives investigating the case.  Another thing the movie totallly misses in once you join a criminal conspiracy you become responsible for whatever happens even if you didn't intend for some of the things to happen.  That was true then and is true today.Although not in the movie Robert Redford said on the today show that Surratt hung for five minutes before dying, absolutely not, she died instantly, Powell hung for five minutes before dying.  Again the old confederate retelling of the tale.The movie misses a lot of great theatric monents that are historically accurate, like Powell's defense of her at the gallows, and her conversation about her bindings hurting her before she was hung (she was told it wouldn't hurt for long).  The acting by Wright is excellent but everyone else is pretty bad.The biggest personality in this case was Booth and the movie really errs in its portrayal of him as just another conspirator, he was the most famous actor of his day, a very handsome and dashing individual with a total reckless disregard for his safety.I think the true importance of Lincoln's assasination is one of the most overlooked aspects of American History, it was pivotal event in the history of our country which to a certain extent reversed the confederate defeat in the war.  The emotions at the time were about 100 times as intense as after 9/11.  People were hung just because they looked like Booth or said they didn't mind Lincoln being dead.

Surratt's son was involved in Booth's numerous revenge plots. Mrs. Surratt owned the boarding house in which the conspirators often met. While there are a number of historical theories and interpretations, the film points out the unconstitutional manner in which the trial was conducted. Historical accuracy or inaccuracy is not my main point of analysis. While obvious characterizations are whole or partially fictitious, the circumstances, Surratt's guilt or innocence and the depth of the pro-Southern conspiracy, are open to historical debate. Therefore, this film is merely an interpretation. However, it is simply flat. Directed by Robert Redford and brimming with talent, it has no logical right to be as lifeless as it felt to me. I can't help but compare it to Spielberg's Lincoln, where political conversation and intrigue is gripping and evocative or Spielberg's earlier historical courtroom drama, Amistad. Compared to those films, the finely crafted sets, costuming, and casting of The Conspirator is dragged down by its lack of passion and its rather drab style.

1414272,AHPV4F8IVSC39,B004LWZVZC,"Douglas B. Moran ""Computer+History/Politics""","[5, 8]","As a movie:Even judged as a propaganda film, this is a bad movie. For ""preaching to the choir"", I would give it 3-stars (""It's OK""), but for the general audience, it is 1-star.Because of the script, most of the characters are little more than cardboard cut-outs. Only Robin Wright (as Mary Surratt) has presence as a character. The other main character is her lawyer Frederick Aiken (played by James McAvoy), but his role is primarily to be outraged, thereby serving as a vehicle for preaching at the audience. I quickly developed an unintended dislike for his character, which increased throughout the movie.The scenes are set-pieces and the flow is poor, resulting in a movie that feels slow-paced and meandering. There is no sense of grappling with the issues or alternatives -- there are only pronouncements and posturing. The movie doesn't rise to even the level of a mediocre episode of Law and Order. Also, many of the scenes do not feel authentic (beyond the costumes and sets). First, many of Aiken's diatribes feel incredibly modern, including things that you weren't likely to hear in 1965, much less in 1865 (I am both old enough and young enough to remember the 1960s). Second, the portrayal of the trial feels derivative of too many movies about military (show) trials, reinforcing my assessment below that the script wasn't driven by the history. Examples:Breaker Morant,Paths of Glory.----As history:This movie prominently advertises itself as presenting a true story, and this needs to be rebutted. If one watches the documentary in the Extras or reads the history, the kindest thing that can be said is that the movie ""was inspired by actual events"", or more accurately that it cherry-picked and distorted events. The viewer will likely have the false impression that this was a short, hurried trial (there was a long line of both prosecution and defense witnesses). That there was little evidence of her guilt. That Mary Surratt was badly mistreated, for example being denied visits by her daughter. ...The movie presents images that are virtually guaranteed to be misinterpreted. For example, the prisoners are shown with bags over their heads, invoking parallels to torture. However, those were _padded_ bags and were introduced in response to a suicide attempt, but apparently were also intended to keep the prisoners from communicating with each other. The bags did turn out to be painful, but I haven't seen anything that suggests that was intentional (above the level of the jailers putting on bags more tightly than needed).The documentary (in the Extras) briefly raises the point that much of the controversy about Mary Surratt's guilt was rooted not in the factual evidence, but in sexism -- that a woman wouldn't/couldn't do such a thing. Yet you won't see this in the movie even though it was a significant part of the trial (character witnesses, pleas for clemency, ...).In describing the response to the assassination, one of the movie's historians describes that assassination as unthinkable. Yet there had been multiple assassination attempts against Lincoln, starting before his inauguration.One of those historians repeatedly attributes Mary Surratt's execution to animosity against Catholics, yet never explains (beyond the existence of religious prejudices) and never mentions that there was a large population of Catholics in Maryland -- because it was founded as a colony as a refuge for Catholics (Aside: In case you are wondering, some of my ancestors came to the US as Protestants fleeing Catholics, some as Catholics fleeing Protestants, and some as Protestants fleeing other types of Protestants).One of the historians in the Extras took umbrage at the measures taken to keep the conspirators from escaping on the reasoning that they hadn't yet been convicted. This seems suggestive of the politics underlying the movie.Some of the historians in the documentary seem to be pushing political agendas. One talks about Sec of War Stanton pushing to get ""a correct result"" as if that was unconnected to justice. Yet the history of the investigation and the trial was one of focusing in on only the most central of the plotters -- many who were unquestionably Confederate sympathizers but were only minor facilitators of the plot were not prosecuted, and not all those convicted were executed. Yet the movie gives the strong impression that the political pressures was to execute persons without concern for their guilt. If so, why include a woman which was bound to be highly controversial?The presentation of the choice to use a military tribunal in both the included documentary and the movie fails to provide even a cursory appreciation for the problems of a civilian trial. For example, until the influx of Northerners during the Civil War, Washington DC was a decidedly Southern city and very pro-slavery (much of the Capitol Building construction used slave labor) and at the time of the trial still had very large pro-Confederacy elements -- the conspirators were hardly alone in this (Aside: neighboring Maryland was a slave state, and although it did not join the Confederacy, much of its population was pro-slavery). In a civilian trial, how would one credibly assemble a jury where there wouldn't be at least one juror who would ignore the facts and instead vote his pro-slavery politics? What would have been the results of a wrongful acquittal of the conspirators?Although the movie is based on the belief that politics determined the verdict, its rendering of the politics of the time is not to be taken seriously. It is minimal, simplistic and mostly wrong.----As an allegory:It is hard to believe that this movie is not intended primarily as a comment on military tribunals in the current ""Global War on Terror"", and was distorted to fill that role. Instead, the Lincoln assassination should be viewed as the opening act in a century of terrorism associated with the Ku Klux Klan (and its predecessors and similar organizations). With the defeat of the Confederate armies, the Union was desperate to keep the rebel troops from melting away and forming guerrilla bands and having the war likely continue for decades. While that was largely prevented, the South stepped down one notch on the insurgency intensity scale and resorted to a widespread campaign of terror to virtually re-institute slavery under other guises and to re-assert the economic and political power of large portions of the old slave-holding class. The North temporarily won the Civil War in 1865, but the South's near-total victory was completed by 1877 (with a few remaining pockets of resistance to be mopped up).Although the trial of Mary Surratt was hardly perfect, it was good-enough and justice was almost certainly done. And it showed a government that could respond effectively and intelligently to an extreme act of terror. It did not wildly and indiscriminately over-react, but implemented a limited, highly targeted response that was open to widespread press coverage and that produced a result that was timely without being rushed.Aside: In choosing to return to a quasi-feudal political and economic system that required the mass of the population -- white and black -- to be kept in poverty, the South consigned itself to be an impoverished region for decades. That system was broken by what could be regarded as the Second Reconstruction: Starting with FDR, the federal government deliberately pumped massive subsidies into the Southern economy (military bases, TVA...). This was followed by education reform, voting rights...So why wasn't this the allegory chosen by Redford et al??-- Douglas B. Moran",1,"Fails as history, as a movie and as an allegory.

1414273,AFFOUXPFSRW94,B004LWZVZC,"Dr. Rob ""Rob""","[4, 7]","The Conspirator, a Robert Redford film, covers the aftermath of President Lincoln's assassination. The focus of this film is the trial of the conspirators, with special treatment on Mrs. Mary Surratt.Mary Surratt was a widow of property who had difficulty running a small farm, stage stop inn, and post office after the death of her husband. At the time of Lincoln's murder, she has leased the Surrattville properties and moved into Washington City (Washington, DC). She runs a boarding house. Mrs. Surratt had three children--two sons, Issaac and John and one daughter, Anna, who was actually a 13 year old girl at the time of Lincoln's murder.Issaac has grown up and is out of the picture in terms of actual events and the world of this film. John is shown as a comrade and fellow plotter with John Wilkes Booth and the others. Anna is made older than John and somewhat self sufficient in this film.The characters of Surratt's boarder and her inn manager/postmaster are closely drawn from the historic record. The boarder was miffed with Mrs. Surratt for butting into other boarders' business and attempting to usurp Mrs. Surratt's authority in her establishment. The stage stop inn manager was a drunk who stole from Mrs. Surratt. One point in the film that is obvious on reading the historical accounts is that the police fixed on Mrs. Surratt when Lewis Payne showed up one to two nights after the assassination looking for help; to that point, the police seemed satisfied that Mrs. Surratt was merely the mother of one alleged suspect, John and of no interest. The appearance at her boarding house changed all of that. The police detained both Mrs. Surratt and Anna for suspicion in President Lincoln's death.Edwin Stanton is portrayed here more as a cutout than a fully developed character. The real life Stanton was obstinate, combative, paranoid, and rash and out to preserve Stanton as opposed to preserving the Union. Presumably, he kept Vice President Johnson from exercising his authority due to Lincoln's mortal wound. Further, do keep in mind that Stanton eventually controlled all the evidence and access to the conspirators and witnesses. Most persons seeing the film or even reading the accounts of the assassination may wonder why the President had no military guards or even a reliable police guard--He did have Major Rathbone who replaced General Grant who declined to attend Ford's Theatre with Lincoln; his valet; and Constable Parker of the Washington Metropolitan Police. Parker left his post and had drinks at a nearby bar, returned and took a seat in the dress circle, abandoning his chair by the door to the President's box because he couldn't see anything of the play. Stanton would not allow his chief telegrapher, a burly Army officer to accompany Lincoln, nor was he too keen on having Grant attend the theatre either.I think that the film works more as an overview of the trial and the manner of its conduct than for the spirit of the times. When Lincoln was shot, the North was celebrating the surrender of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and the tension, stress, and anxiety of the shooting war was somewhat abated. In so far as I have read about Mary Surratt, she never publicly mentioned any Southern sympathy. If anything, Surratt was ambivalent.In real life the overreaching Stanton caught a kick in the seat of his pants, courtesy of a Senate and House delegation regarding the case of Anna Surratt. Most would be shocked to hear that the girl was being held in a cell apart from her mother and without the intervention would have been turned into a co-conspirator and tried with the rest of them.A set of facts were glossed over: the tremendous uproar of the verdict against Mrs. Surratt with the death penalty. Numerous persons protested by telegram and some letters. One of the more prominent calls for a stay of execution came from Pope Leo XIII whose telegram was personally delivered by the Papal Legate and Nuncio to President Andrew Johnson.The film suggests that Mrs. Surratt's co-defendants had no attorneys speaking for them at the trial. This was not true. Mr. Aiken and the other defense counsels did their best against the rules of the court martial. Made some points and kept four of the conspirators from being hanged.The film does a good job of showing how some conspirators actually had no real participation in the assassination. For example, Ed Spangler was a stage hand who held Booth's horse. Spangler had no idea that Booth would kill President Lincoln. Next, George Atzerodt, though a conspirator, never followed up on trying to kill Vice President Johnson. Instead, he had drinks in the hotel bar and left for his brother's home. He was not well off, had no horse, and walked the distance. He probably should have gotten a jail sentence rather than the hangman's rope.Mary Surratt's crime was ""having the nest that contained the assassins."" I do know that Surratt was never in the same room when the conspirators discussed their plans, nor was the boarder in much proximity--he was pretty much ignored by Booth and company.As for John Surratt, Booth's friend and young prodigy, he was not present for the assassination because he had traveled to Canada probably on a mission for the Confederate Secret Service. Eventually, he served in the papal army under an assumed name and finally returned to the United States about 7 - 12 years after the assassination. He was not convicted on the same evidence as the four hanged conspirators which included his mother.As a starting place for the events immediately prior to, during, and after the assassination, The Conspirator does a merely satisfactory job. I did not like the license taken with Anna Surratt. The real life Anna was a child and in great peril until the intervention by the Senate-House delegation. More should have been presented on Edwin Stanton's usurpation of executive authority; control, manipulation, and tampering with evidence and witnesses and his subversion of due process and his confrontation with President Johnson that caused Johnson to fire Stanton after Johnson was acquitted at his impeachment trial which had been orchestrated in part by Edwin Stanton.",3,History Trimmed

Spillers ""cineman""","[1, 1]","Before the feature begins on the Blu-ray, there is a brief introduction about the production company behind the film, called The American Film Company.  They claim they are dedicated to fictional films based on American history, so I can assume there will be more films like The Conspirator, in the future.  I'm looking forward to what they produce.The film itself is an interesting bit of unknown history, unknown at least to me. The Conspirator tells the story of Mary Surratt (Wright), the mother of John Surratt, a known associate of President Lincoln's assassin, actor John Wilkes Booth.  Apparently, since the U.S. could not try Booth himself, having been shot to death days after the deed, a tribunal court was formed by the War Department to try Mary Surratt for her role in the conspiracy to assassinate President Lincoln, Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward.James McAvoy plays Fredrick Aiken, a war hero, fresh from fighting for the Union in the Civil War, charged with defending Mary Surratt. His task is a nearly impossible one, as the country wants blood as payment for the loss of the beloved President.  McAvoy is a weak link in the story, as his portrayal is lightweight.  Aiken appears as though he's unconcerned with the outcome, despite the dialogue and the punishments he faces from friends and society.  There is no urgency in the performance.The story is smart and pretty fascinating, but unfortunately the script is choppy, as it drags in some places and paces much too quickly in others.  It makes for an odd viewing experience at times.  I would have liked to have seen more focus on the conspiracy itself, as much of the trial is spoken of, but barely seen only in very brief flashbacks.  Characters are introduced then cast aside, never to be seen again.  Others are talked about, but hardly seen, adding to the cloudiness of the proceedings.The majority of the cast (with the aforementioned exception of McAvoy and a severely miscast Justin Long) are very good carrying out their historical roles, both famous and infamous.  Kevin Kline is almost unrecognizable as the man behind the tribunal, Edwin Stanton.  He makes the most of his brief time on screen and is memorably villainous.  Wilkinson is also only briefly onscreen as Aiken's mentor, Reverdy Johnson.  He is solid as usual.  I've never been a huge fan of Robin Wright.  Her turn as Jenny in Forrest Gump, always struck me as a blemish in an otherwise classic film.  She is fine here, as she doesn't have much to do but look sad.As a whole, the film, directed by superstar Robert Redford, is a intriguing curiosity of a tumultuous time in our nation's history.History buffs would do well to check out The Conspirator.",4,Interesting History Lesson,1321142400,"11 13, 2011",2011,2740,"['feature', 'Blu-ray', 'brief', 'introduction', 'production', 'company', 'film', 'called', 'American', 'Film', 'Company', 'claim', 'are', 'dedicated', 'fictional', 'films', 'based', 'American', 'history', 'can', 'assume', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'films', 'Conspirator', 'future', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'what', 'produce.The', 'film', 'interesting', 'bit', 'unknown', 'history', 'unknown', 'least', 'Conspirator', 'story', 'Mary', 'Surratt', 'Wright', 'mother', 'John', 'Surratt', 'known', 'associate', 'President', 'Lincoln', 'assassin', 'actor', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'Apparently', 'U.S.', 'could', 'not', 'try', 'Booth', 'having', 'been', 'shot', 'death', 'days', 'deed', 'tribunal', 'court', 'was', 'formed', 'War', 'Department', 'try', 'Mary', 'Surratt', 'role', 'conspiracy', 'assassinate', 'President', 'Lincoln', 'Vice', 'President', 'Andrew', 'Johnson', 'Secretary', 'State', 'William', 'H.', 'Seward.James', 'McAvoy', 'Fredrick', 'Aiken', 'war', 'hero', 'fresh', 'fighting', 'Union', 'Civil', 'War', 'charged', 'defending', 'Mary', 'Surratt', 'task', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'one', 'country', 'blood', 'payment', 'loss', 'beloved', 'President', 'McAvoy', 'weak', 'link', 'story', 'portrayal', 'lightweight', 'Aiken', 'unconcerned', 'outcome', 'dialogue', 'punishments', 'friends', 'society', 'urgency', 'performance.The', 'story', 'smart', 'pretty', 'fascinating', 'unfortunately', 'script', 'choppy', 'places', 'paces', 'much', 'too', 'quickly', 'others', 'odd', 'viewing', 'experience', 'times', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'focus', 'conspiracy', 'as', 'much', 'trial', 'spoken', 'barely', 'seen', 'only', 'very', 'brief', 'flashbacks', 'Characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'then', 'cast', 'aside', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'Others', 'are', 'talked', 'hardly', 'seen', 'adding', 'cloudiness', 'proceedings.The', 'majority', 'cast', 'aforementioned', 'exception', 'McAvoy', 'severely', 'miscast', 'Justin', 'Long', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'carrying', 'out', 'historical', 'roles', 'famous', 'infamous', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'man', 'tribunal', 'Edwin', 'Stanton', 'most', 'brief', 'time', 'screen', 'memorably', 'villainous', 'Wilkinson', 'also', 'only', 'briefly', 'onscreen', 'Aiken', 'mentor', 'Reverdy', 'Johnson', 'solid', 'usual', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'turn', 'Jenny', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'always', 'struck', 'blemish', 'otherwise', 'classic', 'film', 'fine', 'here', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'look', 'whole', 'film', 'directed', 'superstar', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'intriguing', 'curiosity', 'tumultuous', 'time', 'nation', 'history.History', 'buffs', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'check', 'out', 'Conspirator']",N/A

Both the icons lean towards pop history, and Redford's latest in this category is ""The Conspirator"", the tale of Mary Surratt, the widow who was accused of harboring in her Washington DC boarding house the men who plotted the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865. Redford has tried to give this telling a great deal of importance, but perhaps it was his very gravity which betrayed him. In other words, a great deal of the picture is dull. Much of the conflict is performed in daytime drama style, draining the picture of its more successful elements; and, unfortunately, the whole production has a somewhat facile pre-fab appearance. The 19th Century has rarely looked so neat. The only thing missing is the candy-box Technicolor from M~G~M's version of ""Little Women"". I recall only one shot in ""The Conspirator"" of someone smoking, and the Capital's streets seem spotless. Then for some unknown reason (perhaps to balance all the PC primness) there's a completely unbelievable scene in which a young beau jocosely moons a mixed company at an elegant soir&eacute;e. In 1865? I don't think so. Maybe Redford got the 1860s confused with the 1960s. He also seems a little confused about his characters' viewpoints: the young Yankee lawyer who is chosen to defend Mrs Surratt at first seems repelled by her, then somewhat abruptly admires her, perhaps won over by her quiet dignity. Actually, Mrs Surratt seems quiet to the point of indifference, particularly for someone on trial for her life. Then there's her implicated son whom the screenplay tries desperately to make sympathetic, but the fact is he stands by and lets his mother be executed, stating in one of the final scenes that he didn't really think they'd do it. But obviously it's the young lawyer who is meant to be the story's hero. The movie opens with a scene on an 1863 battlefield in which the wounded officer insists that his comrade be tended to first (""That's an order!""); and it ends with his leaving his corrupt profession and entering the pure world of journalism. Yes, the Washington Post, which exposed Watergate and brought the aggressive idealism of the Sixties to its climax.

1414279,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B004LWZVZC,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 4]","THE CONSPIRATOR (dir. Robert Redford, 2010) is a funny little thing. It's a 2-pronged problem, I'd say. Depending on the day you watch it, this truly excellent film will either strike you as a bit dry history on the best day; on a bad day it will bore and irritate you.The same year's THE KILLING OF MARY SURRATT notwithstanding, Redford gives us a rich, exquisitely painted and shot view of 1860s Washington. That in itself makes this worth viewing. It tells the story of Mrs. Mary Surratt (Robin Wright), an alleged co-conspirator of John Wilkes Boothe's (Toby Kebbell, who thankfully never speaks) in the assassination plot against Lincoln and members of his cabinet. (Her boarding house, where they all met and plotted, still stands in the Chinatown of Washington, far from its original Maryland location).There is little relationship and thus no tension between the accused and her defense attorney, Captain Frederick Aiken (another sort of empty-star role for James McAvoy).This is totally a courtroom drama, and even with Redford's love of history, he cannot make it more than what it is. I think he manages to tell a tight, seamless tale; my question is, What additional merits does that have from, say, an episode of ""Perry Mason""? It IS ""Perry Mason"", set in the mid-19th century. Not bad for all that, but I doubt this will have a huge following. I see lots of two- and three-star reviews here.Saying which: the star power Redford amassed is a phenomenon. Best of the bunch is Kevin Kline as Secretary of War Edwin Stanton - a good friend of President Lincoln's who started off despising his very name, and it is possible Stanton never stopped despising Lincoln. We have everyone from the stunning and stirring Evan Rachel Wood to the irascible Justin Long (in a bit part). We have Danny Huston, Colm Meany, the immortal Tom Wilkinson rather wasted in his role, Alexis Bledel, Stephen Root - these are sort of shadowy cameos, one thing about this film I absolutely hated.One thing that delighted me was recognizing certain locations/sets from the TV film LINCOLN (based on Gore Vidal's novel, see my review).The picture of what we all think happened, what really happened, what could have happened, was handled by Redford in a way that one feels he's like us - hates dragged-out flashbacks. In point of fact, I'm not too sure what Redford wanted to say here except that civilians need to be tried in an ordinary court, even in times of war.If this is a solid statement that one could not separate militarily active civilians from non-military civilians during the Civil War, then OK. After all, the country at that time felt rebels had to be put down for the good of the nation - and civilians' actions were either military or they weren't. If this is a cry for the Middle Eastern folk the U.S. is presently holding, I am NOT amused.However, I do admire the overall project and production. My understanding is that this company plans to produce the best in history-telling that we have ever seen. Well, in that mode, to heck with Mary Surratt! I want a good film about President Grover Cleveland, who in my book is second only to Lincoln.I hope they only take what is best from THE CONSPIRATOR - because I do have certain issues with this slightly murky film.

We hear that Boothe got cooked in a barn when they found him but not much more unless you dig deeper. Frankly, I didn't even know that the V.P. Johnson and Secretary of State Seward were also targets but there you have it.In Redford's film much of the story is fleshed out with particular attention to the trial of Mary Surrat as a conspirator in the proceedings. Great attention is paid to detail. The viewer gets a good idea of the socio-political atmosphere prevalent at the time. Nice attention is also paid to the technical details. Clothing, architecture and procedure all add to the whole.

1414288,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,B004LWZVZC,Giordano Bruno,"[3, 7]","""The Conspirator"" is NOT an entertainment. I'm hardly the first to say so; most of the 80-some reviews already posted have taken note of the film's political agenda. Though the script ostensibly depicts the military trial, conviction, and execution of Mary Surratt -- in whose boarding house in Washington DC the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and the attempted assassination of William Seward were plotted -- a viewer of this film would need to be utterly unaware of current events not to grasp that the film is implicitly a denunciation of the actions of the George W Bush administration during the ""War on Terror"". I have no doubt that director Robert Redford and script writer James Solomon intended a connection to be understood between the suspension of habeas corpus in 1863, during the Civil War, and the assaults on civil liberties of the Bush/Cheney neo-conservatives in the name of national security. Yes, there are points of relevant comparison, but unfortunately there are overlapping agendas. I'd love to avoid ranking this preachment-disguised-as-a-film with stars, but I can't. So, it gets one star for muddle or five stars for good intentions, but understand, please, that the ranking is arbitary and could go either way. Therefore, my three stars ... a 'mugwump' solution if ever!First I have to be honest about my own agendas. I'm opposed to capital punishment for any crime under any circumstances, although my opposition is totally rational rather than emotional. There are acts so unspeakably hideous that I would relish shredding the perpetrators with a cheese-grater, but I don't believe judicial murder serves the good of society. The hanging of Mary Surratt, the climax of this film, is patently intended to draw my/your sympathy to a woman who may have been unfairly tried and unjustly punished. Had I been one of the panel of judges in 1865, I would not have voted for her execution, nor for the execution of the other three convicted plotters. I would have stuck with my conscience. But the sympathy for Mary Surratt is merely a ploy in this film, a distractor, a red herring if you will. In fact, the evidence against Mary Surratt is far more than circumstantial. She was guilty, in that she certainly knew what was being plotted. Even Redford and Solomon can't help allowing for her guilt. So the ""agenda"" here isn't opposition to capital punishment or supposition that Mary Surratt was innocent.That brings us back to Bush/Cheney. And that puts me on the spot, because I fiercely agree with the implications of the film. Bush/Cheney violated the provisions of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The prison camp at Guantanamo, the use of torture, the kidnappings -- all villainies and violations of the best American ideals! Take a look at the other one/two star reviews of The Conspirator, and you'll find that supporters of the Bush/Cheney doctrines denounce the film's agenda. And here I am, supporting that agenda yet disapproving of the film! What's up?John Surratt Jr., Mary's son, fled from Washington before the assassination which he had certainly helped to plot. In the film, his mother pleads with him not to go, not to do anything reckless, and he responds that ""the War isn't over yet"". Oh boy, was he right! The War was won on battlefields but it wasn't over in the ""hearts and minds"" of Americans northern or southern. It still isn't over; a good pollster could easily show a strong correlation between opinions about the Civil War and the ideological divisions between Liberals and Conservatives (both mislabeled) in the USA today.I suspect that one's reaction to this film will be determined by one's understandings of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Viewers with Southern, States' rights sympathies would thus be expected to acclaim the film as a sound denunciation of 'Big Government' tyranny. The depiction of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton as an unscrupulous tyrant would suit their prejudices perfectly; he was, after all, a ""radical reconstructionist"". However, such viewers soon run into a dilemma. Most of them are quite ready to side with Bush/Cheney over the so-called Patriot Act and the use of torture. Which agenda comes first?The film muddles diverse agendas too much for my taste. The Civil War was NOT a conflict over States' Rights; that was always a rhetorical smokescreen for other agendas. The Civil War was about slavery,and it's problematical for me that slavery is not even given an allusion in the film. One can argue that the War was not fought by the North to free the slaves, but the other side of the issue is plain as sin. From the perspective of the South, it was a war fought to preserve and extend slavery. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln was the dramatic first blow in the perpetuation of the Civil War  -- Johnny Surratt got that right -- which reversed the Northern victory in battle. I'm not being original; it's been said since the 1870s that ""the North won the War but lost the Peace"". The violence that thwarted Reconstruction, the ugly 'Redemption' and disenfranchisement of the slaves and their descendants, the Jim Crow apartheid and racial cleansing violence of the South for the next hundred years, and the still-too-evident racism of so many in America ... Hey, it's painfully clear that Edwin Stanton, even in this slanderous portrayal, had a point. Not only the assassins and their accessories, like Mary Surratt, were guilty. The entire Confederacy, military and civilian, got unmerited mercy and used it chiefly for revenge.Who can sincerely believe that the virulent attacks on the character of Barack Obama are not at least significantly an expression of racism? These days, 150 years afterwards, Civil War Consciousness is far stronger among Southerners (those of Southern heritage, not those who happen now to live in the South) than among non-Southerners (I use that negative designation to include the many who have no particularly image of themselves as Northerners). ""The South Will Rise Again!"" The Myth of the Lost Cause is still taught in schools and homes. Take a look at the mendacious twaddle in ""The Politically Incorrect Guide to the South (and Why It Will Rise Again)"" by Clint Johnson or the ""PIG to American History"" by Thomas E. Woods. I'd wager that both Johnson and Woods would have ferociously ambivalent reactions to this film, just as I have, but for opposite reasons.What a muddle of historical meditations this awkward film stirs up in my mind!",3,Which Agenda Shall We Pursue?,1316649600,"09 22, 2011",2011,6483,"['Conspirator', 'NOT', 'entertainment', ""'m"", 'hardly', 'first', 'say', 'so', 'most', '80-some', 'reviews',

1414290,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004LWZVZC,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","THE CONSPIRATOR may have had difficulty at the box office because of the controversy over the use of military tribunals that rings across the media today. But this film, based on fact but altered somewhat for cinematic purposes, deals with probably the first misuse of a military tribunal - the infamous trial of the assassinators of President Abraham Lincoln by a conspiracy of citizens, most especially the non-military affiliated Mary Surratt.  James Solomon wrote the story and co-scripted the screenplay with Gregory Bernstein.  The director is Robert Redford who manages to give the entire film the feeling of mid-19th century aura - visually and politically - and suggests there is little difference between the approach and consequences of that time and the current management of 'anti-government' prisoners.The film opens with some scenes from the Civil War battlefield where we meet the severely wounded soldier Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy) attempting to save the life of his buddy Nicholas Baker (Justin Long). The film then jumps to the end of the war when the Confederate generals have surrendered to the Union generals and parties are underway.  Aiken and Baker have survived and Aiken has decided to pursue law.  The President is assassinated by John Wilkes Booth and in the aftermath Booth is killed but it is discovered that there was a plot to kill Lincoln as well vice president Andrew Johnson (Dennis Clark) and secretary of state (Kevin Kline).  The response of the nation is terror and the suspects of the conspiracy are arrested and set for trial.  The conspirators had been meeting in the boarding house of Mary Surratt (Robin Wright) so the military decides she must also be a conspirator and tried with the others 'to put this madness to an end.'  The men in charge of the tribunal include Joseph Holt (Danny Huston) and David Hunter (Colm Meaney).  There is one lawyer, Reverdy Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) who feels that the tribunal is not an acceptable manner in which to try a citizen and assigns the fresh new lawyer Frederick  Aiken to defend Mary Surratt.  At first Aiken hates his role but as time passes and he gets to know Mary Surratt he is convinced of her innocence and implores Mary  (and Mary's daughter Anna - Evan Rachel Wood) to reveal the location of the true problem in their family - Mary's son John (Johnny Simmons).  The story features the change of approach of Aiken and the abuse of justice at the trial and the film ends with some very poignant lessons not only about our history but also about our present.The pacing of the film is slow at times, but the cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel and the musical score my Mark Isham keep the film involving.  James McAvoy offers a sterling performance and the rest of the cast is impressive.  THE CONSPIRATOR is a healthy dip into our nation's past and makes us more alert to our nation's present.

1414294,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B004LWZVZC,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[83, 100]","This film's target audience is leagues beyond just the Civil War fan. ""The Conspirator"" draws the viewer into a period of time and forces a decision between emotions likely felt by North & South Americans of the era. Robert Redford (director/producer) takes a side-note of Lincoln and Civil War history and catapults it into a very believable, re-living, docu-drama-like, story that will touch you at a human and political level. Some viewers will despise the end, others cheer, but oddly, both sides will consider it justice. But was it?Looking at historical accounts, one can find the story buried in the lesser known details of the War's end and a Presidential assassination. Mary Surratt (Robin Wright-`Forrest Gump') is arrested with other men and accused of a murder conspiracy. A planned attack on 3 political leaders. One, Lincoln, would die, and one woman, Mary, would be pushed toward justice at a vengeance speed. No trial by peers, but a tribunal justice, with the deck stacked hugely against innocence. Even her lawyer, Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy-`Atonement' `Narnia') ex-Union fighter was chosen to hasten a guilty verdict and quick hanging. He is reluctant to defend and believes her guilty. The attorney role causes romantic troubles for Aiken, but that is a minor bit of the story. The relationship between Aiken and his client, as well as political/military figures including commission head Gen. Hunter (Colm Meeney) and War Secretary Stanton (Kevin Kline) is the basis for the masterfully written story.This should win awards, perhaps not as individual acting moments, but overall, and on the top of the deserving list is screenplay writer James Solomon. The writing IS the story. A documentary written in dramatic dialogue. The director has brought the written masterpiece alive. The visual effects are a constant 1860s view as through tintype photographs or panoramic daguerreotypes of the era but with subtle color. That is just another stellar decision that gives this film such period authenticity and charm. It reminded me of a stage show once attended of ""Scrooge"" with the entire theater in a light London-like fog. Both were historically invigorating to the senses. ""The Conspirator"" is a towering achievement and quite appropriate in the opening days of the Civil War's Sesquicentennial. Let's hope this spurs more films related to this era, and proves that all do NOT need to be feature-length battle scenes. This is a very fast and emotional two hours of viewing.Painstaking detail to costuming and sets are also to be regarded. In the scene of the hanging (not all tried were lynched) there is obvious consideration to actual photographs taken in 1865. This is a dramatic portrayal, but will also be considered by some to be as close to a documentary as one can get with this historic material. Top hat's off to director Redford and writer Solomon.I was so excited about reading the preliminary accounts of this movie that I attended the second showing on opening day. It was worth the theater price, and I WILL be buying the DVD when available. See it. It's brings back Kennedy assassination memories, and yet hits true to today's politics as well. Dare I add this is educational?

Surratt...played wonderfully by Robin Wright.The fervor to seek revenge overrode seeking true justice, and Miss Surratt basically paid with herlife, simply by being guilty by association. At least that is what a lot of history buffs whospecialize in that particular time period have maintained in theory.James McAvoy turns in an impassioned performance as Miss Surrat's lawyer, who is convincedthat she was not a co-conspirator in the Lincoln plot, and does everything in his powerto try to exonerate her, or at least stall things until more evidence can be gathered.But sadly, it was to no avail.I didn't get bored at all throughout this film, and I would recommend it to anyonewho appreciates intelligent and soulful portrayals of historic events.Mary E. Surratt became the first woman in American history to be executed by the federal government.Many feel that if she could've been tried in a civil court, with a jury of her peers, then herfate may have been different. But it was an all government affair, and the people wanted revenge.Later on, after Miss Surrat is executed, her son, John Surratt, who actually was a conspirator,and brought all of this on his mother, who then went into hiding after the assassination, who could'vesaved his mother if he'd owned up to what he did, and vouched for her innocence, is apprehended,and held for trial. But, by the time this happened, the fervor for revenge had passed, and he was setfree because no one could agree that he had any significant ties to the plot to kill Lincoln.I wonder if he ever felt guilty for his cowardice in the face of retribution, as well as his selfishabandonment of his mother in her hour of peril?----Hmmm, I guess we'll never know.",4,~A Very Well Executed Film On A Dark Period In American History~,1313625600,"08 18, 2011",2011,2714,"['liked', 'movie', 'very', 'much.It', 'was', 'produced', 'directed', 'brilliant', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'who', 'opinion', 'only', 'second', 'superb', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'story-telling', 'directing', 'skills.James', 'McAvoy', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'turn', 'extrordinary', 'performances', 'heading', 'equallyadept', 'supporting', 'cast', 'veteran', 'contemporary', 'actors.The', 'writing', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'etc.', 'were', 'point.The', 'Lincoln', 'assassination', 'right', 'heels', 'bloody', 'Civil', 'War', '1861-65', 'was', 'unprecedented', 'emotional', 'blow', 'Americans', 'time.Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'first', 'American', 'president', 'be', 'assassinated', 'office.People', 'were', 'shock', 'angry', 'wanted', 'blood', 'blood', 'conspiracy', 'was', 'revealed', 'powers', 'be', 'were', 'so', 'filled', 'self-righteousindignation', 'bloodlust', 'anybody', 'remotely', 'affiliated', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'subversiveplot', 'even', 'owner', 'boarding', 'house', 'who', 'also', 'happened', 'be', 'mother', 'one', 'ofthe', 'co-conspirators', '.Mary', 'E.', 'Surratt', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Robin', 'Wright.The', 'fervor', 'seek', 'revenge', 'seeking', 'true', 'justice', 'Miss', 'Surratt', 'basically', 'paid', 'herlife', 'simply', 'being', 'guilty', 'association', 'least', 'what', 'lot', 'history', 'buffs', 'whospecialize', 'particular', 'time', 'period', 'have', 'maintained', 'theory.James', 'McAvoy', 'impassioned', 'performance', 'Miss', 'Surrat', 'lawyer', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'co-conspirator', 'Lincoln', 'plot', 'everything', 'powerto', 'try', 'exonerate', 'least', 'stall', 'things', 'more', 'evidence', 'can', 'be', 'gathered.But', 'sadly', 'was', 'avail.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyonewho', 'appreciates', 'intelligent', 'soulful', 'portrayals', 'historic', 'events.Mary', 'E.', 'Surratt', 'became', 'first', 'woman', 'American', 'history', 'be', 'executed', 'federal', 'government.Many', 'feel', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'tried', 'civil', 'court', 'jury', 'peers', 'then', 'herfate', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'was', 'government', 'affair', 'people', 'wanted', 'revenge.Later', 'Miss', 'Surrat', 'executed', 'son', 'John', 'Surratt', 'who', 'actually', 'was', 'conspirator', 'brought', 'mother', 'who', 'then', 'went', 'hiding', 'assassination', 'who', ""could'vesaved"", 'mother', ""'d"", 'owned', 'up', 'what', 'did', 'vouched', 'innocence', 'apprehended', 'held', 'trial', 'time', 'happened', 'fervor', 'revenge', 'had', 'passed', 'was', 'setfree', 'one', 'could', 'agree', 'had', 'significant', 'ties', 'plot', 'kill', 'Lincoln.I', 'wonder', 'ever', 'felt', 'guilty', 'cowardice', 'face', 'retribution', 'as', 'well', 'selfishabandonment', 'mother', 'hour', 'peril', 'Hmmm', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know']",N/A

1414299,A3NH7PYU4AD5GA,B004LWZVZC,H. Schneider,"[2, 2]","A decent and interesting film, but without the last bite that would have gripped me.The film focuses on the one female `conspirator' hanged after the Lincoln assassination, and on her reluctant defense lawyer. Its subject is the fight for rule of law and the abandonment of rule of law by those in power, who claim higher motives and reasons. The parallel to Guantanamo, water boarding, rendition, etc., is obvious and obviously intended. After all, Robert Redford directs. Equally obviously, many of the negative reviews come from the corner of those who consider rule of law a `liberal' idea.I am not knowledgeable about the specific case of Mary Surratt and her lawyer Aiken, the later founder of the Washington Post. Assuming the story gives an accurate picture, then this was a clear case of judicial murder and of abuse of power. Fair trial was denied. Proof of guilt was non existant, or rather: obviously fabricated and questionable.The hero of the story, McAvoy as lawyer, is a Union army hero turned to the legal profession. His mentor and chief, a Maryland senator, has forced him to accept the Surratt defense against strong resistance. In the course of the trial, he begins to see the injustice that is committed by the military court and he fights in earnest, which leads to bad social consequences for him.One of the weaknesses of the film, for me, was the abruptness of the lawyer's transition from resistance to acceptance and passion. Now he refuses, next he fights. Not a case of good `character development'.One of the strengths of the film is that the character of Mary Surratt is painted as an ambiguous one. She is not very cooperative with her own defense and we need to make up our minds if the fact that she is not entirely sympathetic would be a reason to find her guilty.It is not so much a case of crying- out- loud injustice against an innocent lamb, as the lack of due process against somebody who might actually be guilty. The lesson might have been even stronger if she were even more unlikable.The biggest surprise in the film came when I realized during the credits, that the role of Secretary Stanton, the chief bad man with good motives, had been played by Kevin Kline.

1414301,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B004LWZVZC,Jack E. Levic,"[3, 3]","Many years ago when I was in the 6th Grade, I ordered a book about the Lincoln Assassination at school. Although the book was supposed to be intended for young readers, I vividly remembered the graphic picture of four hooded conspirators--3 men and 1 woman--hanging from the gallows. Thus began my fascination with the Lincoln Assassination and the conspiracy that changed history.Most Americans know that John Wilkes Booth fatally shot Abraham Lincoln in Ford's Theater. Few know his assassination was part of a much grander scheme to totally cripple the US Government with the assassination of the three top US government officials - the President, The Vice-President and the Secretary of State. The ensuing chaos could have brought down the Union government and forever changed the history of the United States.Robert Redford has done a remarkable job in trying to tell a part of the story in a historically accurate manner as possible. THE CONSPIRATOR is a brilliantly staged depiction of a turning point in American history. The movie basically deals with the story of Mary Surrat, a 42-year-old widow who runs a modest boarding house in Washington, D.C.,. Nothing out of the ordinary at first until we learn she is the mother of one of the conspirators and that John Wilkes Booth and other conspirators were frequent visitors to her boarding house. Mary Surrat becomes one of the accused and she and the surviving conspirators are charged in a military court NOT a civil court. Most of their civil rights are suspended in a trial where a guilty verdict is a certainty.THE CONSPIRATOR draws in actual historical documents to tell its tragic story. Was Mary Surrat innocent and her only crime was running the boarding house where the conspirators met and schemed? Of did she play a more active role? Could she have warned the authorities of the impending plan to assassinate the President and two others. Through the years, history has taken a kinder look at Surrat but that vision has changed in recent years and THE CONSPIRATOR does a great job in presenting the facts and bringing a feel for the day as people worried that even a grander conspiracy was in the works.Mary Surrat's innocence or degree of guilt will never be known for sure but her story is an amazing tale of injustice. There never was a chance for a fair trial. The verdicts were known before the trial began. THE CONSPIRATOR is more a story of the trial than of the actual events of that April night. The movie can get dry and ineffectual as we watch the courtroom proceedings. The action scenes are kept to a minimum as we see President Lincoln shot and Secretary of State Seward--recovering from a near fatal carriage accident--brutally stabbed to within an inch of his life. Vice President Andrew Johnson is spared as one of the conspirators is unable to do his chosen deed.There is so much to tell in the Lincoln Assassination..so many side stories and different angles that are breezed over in THE CONSPIRATOR. Of course, there just is too much to tell in one movie. There is Booth's escape and the manhunt, the amazing journey of John Surrat to the Vatican and so much more. Here we have basically one aspect of the whole story and that is the trial of Mary Surrat.Anyone who is a history buff and wants to learn more should get the two disco version of this film. The bonus features include a 67 minute documentary and various featurettes about the making of the movie and about the conspirators.

Miller,"[3, 3]","""Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."" - Benjamin Franklin.One could change Benjamin Franklin's quote to read as ""Those who would give up civil rights to guarantee justice, deserve neither."" Injustice in the name of justice serves as the essential underpinning of The American Film Company's debut film, ""The Conspirator,"" directed by Robert Redford.""The Conspirator"" is the story of the trial of Mary Surratt who was executed for her role in the conspiracy to assassinate, President Abraham Lincoln, Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward. ""It is a story nobody knows wrapped up in a story that everyone knows,"" says Redford.The guilt or innocence of Mary Surratt has been debated among historians since her execution, and will continue to be.  Her complicity in the assassination conspiracy is not the story that screenwriters James Solomon & Gregory Bernstein, nor director Robert Redford set out to tell, but rather they concentrate on her trial as a civilian by a military tribunal.Robin Wright portrays a stoic Mary Surratt who has accepted her fate, the authorities of the United States government having left nothing to chance.  Her silent strength certainly aids the audience in their empathy toward her.  She is originally defended by Reverdy Johnson, a United States Senator from Maryland (played by the always dependable English actor Tom Wilkinson), but for whatever reason Johnson has given the job of Mrs. Surratt's defense to his young associate, and veteran of the Union Army, Frederick Aiken.Aiken, played by Scottish actor James McAvoy, is convinced of Mrs. Surratt's guilt. He is at first openly hostile towards her, but as he comes to realize the fairness of the trial of his client by a military tribunal is a sham.  Mrs. Surratt as the defendant is not allowed to testify on her own behalf, and there is no right to appeal.  Finally he admits to a friend, ""I don't know whether she is guilty or innocent.""The supporting cast is equally as strong as the film's two lead actors; prosecutor Joseph Holt, played by Danny Huston; Edwin M. Stanton, United States Secretary of War, and puppet-master of the trial of the conspirators is sternly played by Kevin Kline; and Mary Surratt's daughter Anna, played by Evan Rachel Wood, at first displays the stoicism of her mother, but gives in to waves of emotion when first her mother is convicted and then taken to the gallows to be hung for her part in the conspiracy.Director Robert Redford and the screenwriters do not dwell on the details of the assassination conspiracy, nor the hunt for Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth.  Neither is the subject of this movie.  But instead they allude to both in montages briefly showing the assassination, and the eventual killing of Booth.One aspect that Redford does concentrate on is the chaos in the street outside Ford's Theater immediately following the assassination, and how they got Lincoln across the street and into the Peterson House, which I found very moving.Of course a story about a trial of a civilian by a military tribunal is as relevant today as it was 145 years ago, and there are plenty of inferences to be made about the political agendas and motives of the film-makers.  We all have political views, and we are lucky enough to be living in the United States where the First Amendment of the Constitution guarantees the right of freedom of speech and the Fifth Amendment which guarantees due process of law to its citizens.There are, however, a few small historical inaccuracies here and there, but any one going to a movie to expect an historically accurate movie, deserve neither accurate history, nor two hours of entertainment.",5,Injustice In The Name Of Justice: The Trial Of Mary Surratt,1315699200,"09 11, 2011",2011,3774,"['who', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'essential', 'Liberty', 'purchase', 'little', 'temporary', 'Safety', 'deserve', 'Liberty', 'Safety', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin.One', 'could', 'change', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'quote', 'read', 'who', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'civil', 'rights', 'guarantee', 'justice', 'deserve', 'Injustice', 'name', 'justice', 'serves', 'essential', 'underpinning', 'American', 'Film', 'Company', 'debut', 'film', 'Conspirator', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Conspirator', 'story', 'trial', 'Mary', 'Surratt', 'who', 'was', 'executed', 'role', 'conspiracy', 'assassinate', 'President', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vice', 'President', 'Andrew', 'Johnson', 'Secretary', 'State', 'William', 'H.', 'Seward', 'story', 'nobody', 'wrapped', 'up', 'story', 'everyone', 'Redford.The', 'guilt', 'innocence', 'Mary', 'Surratt', 'been', 'debated', 'historians', 'execution', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'complicity', 'assassination', 'conspiracy', 'not', 'story', 'screenwriters', 'James', 'Solomon', 'Gregory', 'Bernstein', 'director', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'set', 'out', 'tell', 'rather', 'concentrate', 'trial', 'civilian', 'military', 'tribunal.Robin', 'Wright', 'stoic', 'Mary', 'Surratt', 'who', 'accepted', 'fate', 'authorities', 'United', 'States', 'government', 'having', 'left', 'nothing', 'chance', 'silent', 'strength', 'certainly', 'audience', 'empathy', 'originally', 'defended', 'Reverdy', 'Johnson', 'United', 'States', 'Senator', 'Maryland', 'played', 'always', 'dependable', 'English', 'actor', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'reason', 'Johnson', 'given', 'job', 'Mrs.', 'Surratt', 'defense', 'young', 'associate', 'veteran', 'Union', 'Army', 'Frederick', 'Aiken.Aiken', 'played', 'Scottish', 'actor', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'convinced', 'Mrs.', 'Surratt', 'guilt', 'first', 'openly', 'hostile', 'towards', 'realize', 'fairness', 'trial', 'client', 'military', 'tribunal', 'sham', 'Mrs.', 'Surratt', 'defendant', 'not', 'allowed', 'testify', 'own', 'behalf', 'right', 'appeal', 'Finally', 'friend', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'equally', 'as', 'strong', 'film', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'prosecutor', 'Joseph', 'Holt', 'played', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'Edwin', 'M.', 'Stanton', 'United', 'States', 'Secretary', 'War', 'puppet-master', 'trial', 'conspirators', 'sternly', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Mary', 'Surratt', 'daughter', 'Anna', 'played', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'first', 'stoicism', 'mother', 'waves', 'emotion', 'when', 'first', 'mother', 'convicted', 'then', 'taken', 'gallows', 'be', 'hung', 'part', 'conspiracy.Director', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'screenwriters', 'do', 'not', 'dwell', 'details', 'assassination', 'conspiracy', 'hunt', 'Lincoln', 'assassin', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'subject', 'movie', 'instead', 'allude', 'montages', 'briefly', 'showing', 'assassination', 'eventual', 'killing', 'Booth.One', 'aspect', 'Redford', 'concentrate', 'chaos', 'street', 'Ford', 'Theater', 'immediately', 'following', 'assassination', 'how', 'got', 'Lincoln', 'street', 'Peterson', 'House', 'found', 'very', 'moving.Of', 'course', 'story', 'trial', 'civilian', 'military', 'tribunal', 'relevant', 'today', 'was', '145', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'plenty', 'inferences', 'be', 'made', 'political', 'agendas', 'motives', 'film-makers', 'have', 'political', 'views', 'are', 'lucky', 'enough', 'be', 'living', 'United', 'States', 'where', 'First', 'Amendment', 'Constitution', 'right', 'freedom', 'speech', 'Fifth', 'Amendment', 'due', 'process', 'law', 'citizens.There', 'are', 'however', 'few', 'small', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'here', 'there', 'one', 'going', 'movie', 'expect', 'historically', 'accurate', 'movie', 'deserve', 'accurate', 'history', 'two', 'hours', 'entertainment']",N/A
1414304,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B004LWZVZC,James Morris,"[8, 9]","The Conspirator, directed with skill by Robert Redford, is a sleek and atmospheric historical drama.  The story is meticulously researched and suspenseful throughout.  In the 145 years since the actual event, many theories have developed on the guilt or innocence of Mary Surratt, the boardinghouse owner whose son John was almost certainly part of the plot to assassinate Abraham Lincoln, his Vice President Andrew Johnson and his Secretary of State William H. Seward.Many historians now agree that Mary Seward was probably part of the conspiracy.  Although she may not have taken part in the actual planning, she almost certainly knew and approved of John Wilkes Booth's plot against the government and, had she not approved, she probably would have been able to stop it.  The focus of this film is neither her innocence or guilt, but rather her lack of a fair trial, given that the Secretary of War, Edward M. Stanton, not only directed that the conspirators receive trial by a military tribunal, he was later denounced by many as tampering with witnesses during the trial.  The Supreme Court later ruled that the trial of citizens by military tribunal was unconstitutional.  Mary Surratt's son John, a courier and Confederate spy who was also probably guilty but was not apprehended until 1866, was given a trial by jury and released after his trial resulted in a hung jury.However, the most impressive aspect of this film, aside from its predominantly historical accuracy, is the amazing amount of care that went into its visuals.  Costumes, sets, and every other physical aspect of the story are brought to life down to the smallest detail, with a look and atmosphere that makes the viewer feel they have stepped back into the middle of the 19th century.  The historic photos that were taken of the execution of the four main conspirators were the obvious source of design for the hanging scene and one has to marvel at how authentic it all looks by every account of the actual story.  The scene of the trial and execution looks precisely like the Washington arsenal where it all took place, and so do the scenes in Ford's theatre, the Surratt boardinghouse and virtually every other location used in the making of this wonderful film.Included with the DVD is a second disc that includes a full-length documentary, with fascinating facts that I was previously unaware of, and I am a Lincoln buff.  I wish only that the film had included a little more on the attempted assassination of William H. Seward; the fact that he survived is not evident in the scene where he is attacked, although at the trial, Seward's attacker is referred to several times as the ""attempted assassin"".On the whole, The Conspirator is an extremely satisfying and vividly detailed historical drama, and is sure to be enjoyed by anyone who is interested in the American Civil War or the Assassination of Abraham Lincoln.Highly recommended.",5,A Masterpiece of Authenticity!,1313712000,"08 19, 2011",2011,2919,"['Conspirator', 'directed', 'skill', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'sleek', 'atmospheric', 'historical', 'drama', 'story', 'meticulously', 'researched', 'suspenseful', '145', 'years', 'actual', 'event', 'many', 'theories', 'have', 'developed', 'guilt', 'innocence', 'Mary', 'Surratt', 'boardinghouse', 'owner', 'son', 'John', 'was', 'almost', 'certainly', 'part', 'plot', 'assassinate', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vice', 'President', 'Andrew', 'Johnson', 'Secretary', 'State', 'William', 'H.', 'Seward.Many', 'historians', 'now', 'agree', 'Mary', 'Seward', 'was', 'probably', 'part', 'conspiracy', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'taken', 'part', 'actual', 'planning', 'almost', 'certainly', 'knew', 'approved', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'plot', 'government', 'had', 'not', 'approved', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'stop', 'focus', 'film', 'innocence', 'guilt', 'rather', 'lack', 'fair', 'trial', 'given', 'Secretary', 'War', 'Edward', 'M.', 'Stanton', 'not', 'only', 'directed', 'conspirators', 'receive', 'trial', 'military', 'tribunal', 'was', 'later', 'denounced', 'many', 'tampering', 'witnesses', 'trial', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'later', 'ruled', 'trial', 'citizens', 'military', 'tribunal', 'was', 'unconstitutional', 'Mary', 'Surratt', 'son', 'John', 'courier', 'Confederate', 'spy', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'probably', 'guilty', 'was', 'not', 'apprehended', '1866', 'was', 'given', 'trial', 'jury', 'released', 'trial', 'resulted', 'hung', 'jury.However', 'most', 'impressive', 'aspect', 'film', 'aside', 'predominantly', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'amazing', 'amount', 'care', 'went', 'visuals', 'Costumes', 'sets', 'other', 'physical', 'aspect', 'story', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'down', 'smallest', 'detail', 'look', 'atmosphere', 'viewer', 'feel', 'have', 'stepped', 'back', 'middle', '19th', 'century', 'historic', 'photos', 'were', 'taken', 'execution', 'four', 'main', 'conspirators', 'were', 'obvious', 'source', 'design', 'hanging', 'scene', 'one', 'marvel', 'how', 'authentic', 'looks', 'account', 'actual', 'story', 'scene', 'trial', 'execution', 'precisely', 'Washington', 'arsenal', 'where', 'took', 'place', 'so', 'do', 'scenes', 'Ford', 'theatre', 'Surratt', 'boardinghouse', 'virtually', 'other', 'location', 'used', 'making', 'wonderful', 'film.Included', 'DVD', 'second', 'disc', 'full-length', 'documentary', 'fascinating', 'facts', 'was', 'previously', 'unaware', 'am', 'Lincoln', 'buff', 'wish', 'only', 'film', 'had', 'included', 'little', 'more', 'attempted', 'assassination', 'William', 'H.', 'Seward', 'fact', 'survived', 'not', 'evident', 'scene', 'where', 'attacked', 'trial', 'Seward', 'attacker', 'referred', 'several', 'times', 'attempted', 'assassin', 'whole', 'Conspirator', 'extremely', 'satisfying', 'vividly', 'detailed', 'historical', 'drama', 'sure', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'Assassination', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Is it the mother, Mary, or the son, John?  Did Mary Surratt provide the nest where the assignation plot incubates?  Did John Surratt conspire with and aid the killers?  History provides enough evidence to insure that one or both are guilty.Historically, a military court finds Mary Surratt guilty and sentences her be hang.  Over a year later, a civilian court finds John not guilty and he is released.  Over the years, more than one person has questioned the verdicts and the conduct of the trails.This movie is a feast for those that feel the government murdered Mary Surratt and that her son abandoned her.  Edwin M. Staunton is the villain.  His actions ensure that Mary is condemned to death even as the military court waivers.  How Staunton is able to do this is not shown.  However, there is no question that he is able to force his will on a number of very able men, all generals and several with excellent connections.Redford avoids any comparisons between 1865 and now.

1414308,A140XH16IKR4B0,B004LWZVZC,Jean E. Pouliot,"[24, 37]","The trial of Abraham Lincoln's killers has never received all that much attention. More focus is on the assassination itself, the path of the bullet, the funeral train and the tear-filled burial in Springfield. But the trial, coming as it did at a time of national grief and paranoia, had strong echoes of our current political climate, which is undoubtedly why Robert Redford decided to film it. But Redford's fast and loose approach to the facts of the case made it clear that his focus was more on filming a parable than in depicting history.The film starts in the middle, with Redford sketching a 15-minute synopsis of the events of the assassination night. Aside from Lincoln, 2 other high government officials were targeted by conspirators led by John Wilkes Booth. Veep Andrew Johnson's attacker got cold feet and didn't act. Secretary of State Seward's face was viciously slashed in a knife attack, but his life was saved by a metal neck brace he wore on account of a recent carriage accident. Lincoln was shot in the back of the head while watching a play. Very quickly, the residents and visitors to Mary Surratt's DC boarding house (where Booth and the other conspirators hung out) were rounded up and imprisoned in connection with the crimes.The rest of the film revolved around the case of Mary Surratt -- finding her an attorney, the details of the trial and the execution of the condemned.I have to admit that when I first saw the film, I was excited about the lengths that Redford had gone to show us Washington as it might have appeared in 1865, with its dirt streets, horse traffic and oil illumination. James McAvoy did a creditable job portraying the youthful defense attorney Frederick Aiken. Kevin Klein played Secretary of War Edward Stanton with steel and conviction. Robin Wright was noble and mournful as Mary Surratt. The other conspirators - Booth, Herold, Powell, Mudd and the rest -- looked very much like their photographs. The scaffold build for the execution was very much the real one. Booth's death in a Virginia barn was shown fairly accurately. The actor's at Ford's spoke the right line (""you sockdolagizing old mantrap!"") at the time of the shooting. And the panic as Lincoln was carried through a throng of Washingtonians to the Peterson house was fairly convincing. And the recently-completed Capitol building (its dome was finished in 1863) reared up appropriately from an as-yet-unbuilt landscape.But after a day or two of thinking about the film and checking out historical sources, my ardor began to dim. For whatever reason, Redford changed historical details - nboth important and unimportant to the plot. He replaced Aiken's wife with a girlfriend. He erased Aiken's partner at the defense table. His Booth did not catch his spur on the bunting in front of the President's box in Ford's theater and was chased out by a theater goer. I'm sure that historians, not to mention the Civil War buffs, will find lots to quibble with regarding uniforms and tactics.But worse than all this is the way Redford skewed his characters. The Union generals were made to appear to be bloodthirsty buffoons or calculating knaves. The Union's witnesses were shown to be liars and drunks. Meanwhile, the Southerners were simple folk infused with love of country and honor. The echoes of ""Birth of a Nation"" were far too strong for this Union boy's taste. The story of the conspiracy, told in flashbacks, tended to exonerate Mary Surratt. She was never shown in the same room as Booth. Indeed there was only one scene in which Redford showed her with knowledge of the conspirators' plans. In prison, she was show as sickly, or praying with a priest, or with a rosary in her hand. Redford pretty much paints her as a poor, martyred religious mom just trying to protect her kids. The reality is far murkier. She was caught in numerous deceits. Her town of Surrattsville was a known nest of Confederate spies and couriers. The testimony of numerous witnesses spun a strong web of circumstantial evidence about her involvement in the plot.But no matter. Redford is not interested in retelling 150-year-old historical incident, but in commenting on the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. This is a fine and even noble impulse. But to make the parallels fit, he needs to show Mary Surratt as an innocent caught in a web of paranoia and revenge. So, history must bend -- an inexcusable wrong that rewrites history to make a political point.Strictly from a storytelling point of view, the film was a disappointment. Aside from the stunning visuals, the narrative and acting were devoid of emotion. The actors often seemed as stiff as if they were posing for a daguerreotype. The state of high-alert in the Capitol and the loathing of the rebels during the still-hot Civil War were curiously muted. Redford insists on having Aiken repeat the courtroom clich&eacute; of yelling out at some injustice or other. At the trial, the other seven or so defendants were wasted - having little else to do than to sit while Surratt's trial went on. And the most interesting part of the story - the conspiracy to kidnap and then kill Lincoln - hardly made it to the screen.A movie that gave fresh insights to our contemporary fears about invaders and the need for justice would have been welcomed. But Redford's hack job on the events of the spring and summer of 1865 did violence and injustice to history, and failed to parallel the contemporary situation. And by so one-sidedly slandering Surratt's executioners, notably by showing Stanton as a Cheneyesque bender of the law, he may inadvertently revive ancient hatreds about the war that still simmer beneath the surface of our national discourse.

1414309,AA90W95STFGAC,B004LWZVZC,jj,"[3, 3]","I picked this up at redbox for a buck just because I couldn't find anything else and also because I generally think what Robert Redford is doing with independent film overall is a really good thing.I really loved this movie, although I almost didn't finish it.  The start is rough, IMHO (sorry Rob).  I actually went to the director's VO and listened to his thoughts after I watched it and he was really on target, again, in my humble opinion.  But, what he was trying to do in those early scenes just did not work for more than one reason, IMHO.Obviosuly, we all know this is an indpt. film.  But you just cannot say, ""Excuse me, I didn't have the budget to look big.""  The better choice is to choose scenes that don't have to look big.  The battlefiled scene, IMHO, looked small budget.  I know what he was trying to do with that character and he gets kudos for the effort, because most directors don't even get that you have to like or be drawn inextricably for some reason to your main character.  But, I think the better choice would have been to start with Mary and to see her coming to the door and maybe bringing in or offering refreshments to the conspirators.  The big thing is that I did not get a feel for whether these men were in fact ""the conspirators"" and that bothered and distracted me whenever I would see them throughout the film.  I don't think this is anything RR could have realized, but if he'd tested it on an audience, he might have heard that and also heard that his scene with the antsy conspirator is REALLY distracting and confusing.  In the VO he says what he was tryign to accomplish, but I don't think he did and he wasted valuable time on that which could have been used to make who these men were more clear and what they intended to do more clear so it could be followed when it happend on the screen.  As it was, it was just a jumble.  Even when they took Abe across the street (good scene) and then the War Sec comes in, he just looks at the boots!  Now this has some cinematic value AFTER he makes a point to realize it is over with Abe, but he clearly would have looked at more than that at the getgo---so this was distracting.  The barn scene just looked low budget.  And the scene with the fiance is just dull and slow.  I heard what he said on the VO, but I really think testing it would have led to a MUCH better opening.  I also know he wanted to be authentic, hence the beards, but it would have been nice to have said, they all wore beards back then, and to have made it more 2011-viewer-cinematic-friendly without them.So, why did I give it 5 stars?  It's an excellent movie and well told after those initial scenes.  It's suspeneseful right up to the end---I had no idea what was going to be the outcome and I wanted to know.  I came to care about both of the leads.  And the legal aspect of it was very interesting and enjoyable to me.  He did not put at the end that the sec of war was fired or that the pres was impeached (which you hear in the VO).  I think he should have added that onto the screen with the other outcomes.Overall, I really liked this film and I learned a lot from it.  I really think this movie will be well-received by an older audience that likes documentaries and history.  I think he did a great job turning history into film!  If you are looking for fluff, this isn't it.  You have to be a ""thinking"" person to enjoy it.  I know he saw parallels with the modern day fears we face and the rush we make to judgment.  Everyone condemns the way Japanese-Americans were treated in the war, but then we saw what that fear was after 911 whenever we encountered an Arab-American.  Overall, it's clear to me that judging what people did throughout history often is difficult because we cannot feel their emotions.  RR conveys the emotion of that time and how it played out.",5,"Rough start, but excellent overall",1315180800,"09 5, 2011",2011,3841,"['picked', 'up', 'redbox', 'buck', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'else', 'also', 'generally', 'think', 'what', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'doing', 'independent', 'film', 'overall', 'really', 'good', 'thing.I', 'really', 'loved', 'movie', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'finish', 'start', 'rough', 'IMHO', 'sorry', 'Rob', 'actually', 'went', 'director', 'VO', 'listened', 'thoughts', 'watched', 'was', 'really', 'target', 'again', 'humble', 'opinion', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'early', 'scenes', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'more', 'one', 'reason', 'IMHO.Obviosuly', 'know', 'indpt', 'film', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'budget', 'look', 'big', 'better', 'choice', 'choose', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'look', 'big', 'battlefiled', 'scene', 'IMHO', 'looked', 'small', 'budget', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'character', 'kudos', 'effort', 'most', 'directors', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'have', 'like', 'be', 'drawn', 'inextricably', 'reason', 'main', 'character', 'think', 'better', 'choice', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'start', 'Mary', 'see', 'coming', 'door', 'maybe', 'bringing', 'offering', 'refreshments', 'conspirators', 'big', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'feel', 'men', 'were', 'fact', 'conspirators', 'bothered', 'distracted', 'whenever', 'would', 'see', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'RR', 'could', 'have', 'realized', ""'d"", 'tested', 'audience', 'might', 'have', 'heard', 'also', 'heard', 'scene', 'antsy', 'conspirator', 'REALLY', 'distracting', 'confusing', 'VO', 'what', 'was', 'tryign', 'accomplish', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'did', 'wasted', 'valuable', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'make', 'who', 'men', 'were', 'more', 'clear', 'what', 'intended', 'do', 'more', 'clear', 'could', 'be', 'followed', 'when', 'happend', 'screen', 'was', 'was', 'just', 'jumble', 'Even', 'when', 'took', 'Abe', 'street', 'good', 'scene', 'then', 'War', 'Sec', 'just', 'boots', 'Now', 'cinematic', 'value', 'AFTER', 'point', 'realize', 'Abe', 'clearly', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'more', 'getgo', '-so', 'was', 'distracting', 'barn', 'scene', 'just', 'looked', 'low', 'budget', 'scene', 'fiance', 'just', 'dull', 'slow', 'heard', 'what', 'said', 'VO', 'really', 'think', 'testing', 'would', 'have', 'led', 'MUCH', 'better', 'opening', 'also', 'know', 'wanted', 'be', 'authentic', 'hence', 'beards', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'said', 'wore', 'beards', 'back', 'then', 'have', 'made', 'more', '2011-viewer-cinematic-friendly', 'them.So', 'why', 'did', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'excellent', 'movie', 'well', 'told', 'initial', 'scenes', 'suspeneseful', 'right', 'end', '-I', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'outcome', 'wanted', 'know', 'came', 'care', 'leads', 'legal', 'aspect', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'enjoyable', 'did', 'not', 'put', 'end', 'sec', 'war', 'was', 'fired', 'pres', 'was', 'impeached', 'hear', 'VO', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'added', 'screen', 'other', 'outcomes.Overall', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'learned', 'lot', 'really', 'think', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'well-received', 'older', 'audience', 'documentaries', 'history', 'think', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'turning', 'history', 'film', 'are', 'looking', 'fluff', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'thinking', 'person', 'enjoy', 'know', 'saw', 'parallels', 'modern', 'day', 'face', 'rush', 'make', 'judgment', 'Everyone', 'condemns', 'way', 'Japanese-Americans', 'were', 'treated', 'war', 'then', 'saw', 'what', 'fear', 'was', '911', 'whenever', 'encountered', 'Arab-American', 'Overall', 'clear', 'judging', 'what', 'people', 'did', 'history', 'often', 'difficult', 'can', 'not', 'feel', 'emotions', 'RR', 'conveys', 'emotion', 'time', 'how', 'played', 'out']",N/A

Unfortunately, 'Cuzin' Mary was up to her bonnet in the planning and execution (no pun intended) of the murder and attempted murders. She was guilty. But where Redford did well was show how sentiments were so strong that those in charge really did abuse her Constitutional rights and railroaded her through the trial, found her guilty then hanged he with three of the others.

1414315,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B004LWZVZC,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[16, 19]","Most American's are familiar with the Civil War and its aftermath, but one of the lesser known aspects of the Civil War is the rounding up of conspirators in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and their subsequent trial, in particular the case of Mary Surratt. This is the story Robert Redford brings us in ""The Conspirator.""The story in ""The Conspirator"" isn't one we're all unfamiliar with. A young inexperienced lawyer, Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy) is assigned a client he initially thinks is guilty, Mary Suratt (Robin Wright) in a conspiracy to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. As facts come to light and the prosecution obviously takes liberties in trying to hide evidence, pressure witnesses, and allow for only one viewpoint of evidence, that he slowly comes to the realization that while his client maybe guilty she isn't getting a fair trial and provides a more vigorous defense then at first thought possible. John Grisham has told this story many times.The movie is told from Aiken's point of view in his defense of Suratt, how it affects his life and relationships, and as his defense becomes more effective how he's exiled from Washington society and he starts to become suspect by his friends and the very people that appointed him to the position. In brief flashbacks we're also shown just enough of the conspiracy and the action of the conspirators that we can know what's going on.This isn't a glamor role for Robin Wright she barely wears make up, her lips dry and parched after being in prison for a month. She plays Suratt with matronly dignity expected of a woman of the age. James McAvoy gives a strong performance as a Union Captain who comes back from war and wants to return to his private life only to be thrust back into fighting, only this time in the courtroom. Kevin Kline's Edwin Stanton is absolutely ruthless in his pursuit of the assassins of Abraham Lincoln, and we're shown that ruthlessness almost immediately when he bars the distraught Mary Todd Lincoln from the President's side after he's taken from Ford's theater. In the supporting cast Evan Rachael Wood as Anna Surrat stands out, and Stephen Root, while having a small role always makes it interesting.Director Robert Redford shot this film beautifully, the gaslights glisten, and a couple of times looks like a Georges Seurat painting, perhaps in contrast to the cramped and war torn buildings most of the action occurs in and around.Yes, Redford's story has resonances and similarities to today's world, but history always will be relevant to the day, and the adage that ""those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it"" was never truer. ""The Conspirator"" reminds us of that history. But we aren't beaten over the head with a ""message,"" Redford gives voice to both sides of the argument, with Stanton arguing that all measures should be taken to roundup the conspirators and put in front of a military tribunal in the name of expediency in healing a nation torn apart.

Compared to other topical historical films (""John Adams""), this film fails to compel the audience to care about the central characters.  The extremely sparce character development is centered on the figure of Mary Surratt, who ironically becomes the sympathetic figure of the movie.  Mary Surratt is the owner and operator of the Surratt boarding house, the very place Lincoln's cospirators met to plot their conspiracy to kidnap Lincoln and hold him hostage for the release of Confederate soldiers in Union prison camps.  Mary Surratt's defense was that she knew nothing of the plot that was hatching at her own boarding house, which in reality is highly doubtful.  If one reads history of the event, the evidence quite clearly implicates Mary Surratt in the conspiracy, thus, I have a hard time understanding Redford's sympathetic view of Surratt, and a hard time taking this film seriously.On the plus side, the sets are realistic for the 1865 era, and I also appreciate the filmography angles and limited lighting (rooms were illuminated by windows, candles, and gas lamps).

We have the zealous Aiken being true to the Constitutional rights of the accused and imperial government bureaucrats and big wigs who seem bent on railroading a guilty verdict and influencing the sentence.One thing I didn't understand is why they portrayed Frederick Aiken and his wife, Sarah Weston as engaged rather than married. They married 8 years before the action in the movie.The language used seemed to be pointed at current decisions made with respect to the war on terror.

I readRobert Redford: The Biographythis summer and am well aware of the ups and downs in Redford's career.  This film is an amazing accomplishment.  Dramatically, it brings us completely into the world of Washington D.C. in the final days of the Civil War.  For a movie that clocks in slightly over two hours, Redford keeps us riveted.  Robin Wright's performance as Mary Suratt is stunning.  She had briefly worked with Redford onThe Last Castle.  While the film may not achieve the needed buzz to generate an Oscar nomination, her performance would certainly warrant such recognition.  As Suratt, Wright is subtle and mostly serene, exploding only momentarily in the court room, ""You lie!""  The quirk of impaired eyesight leads to Wright frequently squinting, which is addressed in the script well after she has established it.  I found her performance very moving.  James McAvoy does a sterling performance as Suratt's lawyer Frederick Aiken.  Makeup and period costuming disguise Kevin Kline's excellent performance as Edwin Stanton.  Evan Rachel Wood does a fine job with her supporting part as Anna Suratt.  John Callum who has frequently been on TV's ""Law & Order"" does an excellent cameo as Judge Wylie who signs the writ granting Suratt a reprieve.  Norman Reedus cops some great attitude as conspirator Lewis Payne.  Cullen Moss turns in a strong but brief performance as the aid to Stanton.  There are no weak links in the large cast.  Redford deftly handles an amazingly strong ensemble.  The film builds to its final conclusion as the conspirators climb onto the gallows.The two-disc special edition is well worth the price.

Well, when I watched The Conspirator, what I saw was the denigration of the constitutional rights of American citizens, in order to satisfy the vengeful motives of the bureaucracy. Was Mary Surratt guilty of conspiring to kill President Lincoln? Maybe. Even probably.  But trying her, and the other four conspirators, for murder, in a military court, was a gross and indecent miscarriage of justice. The murderer, John Wilkes Booth, was dead, and the authorities were out for blood, not merely for revenge but also to drive home the fact that the South had lost the Civil War. And that is the point of this movie, plain and simple.With respect to the cinematic qualities of The Conspirator, the acting was competent, the sets and backgrounds evocative of those dark days, and the courtroom scenes compelling.

It's hard to imagine she didn't know what was going on in her boarding house and what her own son was up to.  Booth and his associates were constants in her home.

1414333,A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ,B004LWZVZC,"L. Power ""nlp trainer""","[256, 269]","When I went to see this movie I knew nothing about it.  The trailer merely indicated a period courtroom drama starring James McAvoy.While I would hesitate to call it one of the best movies of the year, undoubtedly this movie or more precisely the story this movie relates impacted me more deeply than most do.  So much so that I have bought several books on the subject to get as full an understanding of this event as possible.As an experienced director and actor Robert Redford knows how to push the audiences buttons, making socially relevant, and relatable movies.Here then a true story of a divided country just arrived at an uneasy peace after a bitter civil war, when recently reinaugurated President Lincoln is suddenly assassinated by an actor in a theater.  Not only is the president assassinated, there is a simultaneous attempt to murder the Secretary of State Seward, and Vice President Johnson.As the manhunt begins for Booth, and his accomplices, suspicions turn to a young known associate John Surratt.  Police go to his house, and in his absence end up arresting his mother Mary Surratt for being complicit in the crime of which he is suspected.  But is she guilty of being a conspirator, or just guilty of being a mother of an alleged one, an innocent running a boarding house where these conspirators would meet?She is remanded to be tried in a military court.  Frank Aiken, a young veteran of the Union Army, becomes her unwilling counsel. Her rights to a jury trial in a civilian court overruled, one can sense that the odds stacked against her.  It's a desperate situation.  Her guilt appears to be a foregone conlusion.  She is not permitted to testify in her own defencse.  Will her son return and save the day?  If you're like me these are some of the questions that may run through your mind as you watch this movie.Other people arrested with her testify for the state implicating her in the conspiracy.  These people are not themselves charged.  An alcoholic bartender, John Lloyd, very lucky not to be charged himself firmly impicates her with extremely damning uncorroborated testimony.  A boarder Louis Weichman testifies that some of the conspirators met at her house on numerous occasions.  But if he knew so much how come he did not report his suspicions to the authorities in advance?Probably most shocking for me was new President Johnson, suspending a writ of habeas corpus written by a judge, on a matter of life and death, a precedent ironically set by Lincoln to be used in wartime, now used to seal the conspirators fates in peacetime.I found this interference by the executive office in a judicial proceeding to be most surprising and shocking, and difficult to believe, but it turns out to be true.  I checked.For dramatic purposes, some minor but significant facts have been altered.  For example, Mary Surratt had two counsel not one.  In addition, there were eight people on trial not four.  The four not included in the movie were given life sentences, and those surviving would ultimately be pardoned by President Johnson within four years.One life sentence to Dr Mudd, 'his name is mud,' who treated Booth's fractured leg, and another to Ned Spangler, the stage hand and stable boy asked by Booth to hold his horse, while he went into the theater.President Johnson famously said of her, ""She kept the nest that hatched the egg.""I highly recommend this movie. If you have further interest in this topic I recommend the books:Blood on the Moon: The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln, a tremendously lucid account of events, which ties up the loose ends, particularly what happened with John Surratt.  He was tried for the same crime, in a civilian court but not on the same facts.  He does explore the legal standards in defining what a conspiracy is which I found helpful, and many other things.American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies, explores not only the conspiracy, but also the life of John Wiles Booth, giving a full background.Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase for Lincoln's Killer (P.S.), which reads like a fast paced thriler while sticking to the facts.To a somewhat lesser degreeThe Assassin's Accomplice: Mary Surratt and the Plot to Kill Abraham Lincoln. I have browsed through this one numerous times at the local bookstore, yet have been reluctant to buy it.  For one thing, she glosses over the habeas corpus issue, giving it half a page.  She does not tie up the loose end of what happened with John Surratt like Steers does.  She also concludes Surratt's guilt, yet I found her reasoning somewhat suspect.  Even though her book ties in with the movie,  I prefer that Redford allows us to make up our own minds.Two different people watching this movie could arrive at a totally different conclusion about Mary Surratt's complicity, and I think that's the way Redford would like it, to keep the mystery alive. It kept it alive for me.I hope you enjoy this movie and I hope this review was helpful.",4,She kept the nest that hatched the egg,1306368000,"05 26, 2011",2011,4975,"['When', 'went', 'see', 'movie',

Robin Wright demonstrates an unexpected maturity as Mary, a devoted mother whose reticence to implicate her son ultimately her downfall.

The cast is superb with James McAvoy in the lead as attorney Frederick Aiken who is appointed to defend alleged conspirator Mary Surratt, played by the wonderful Robin Wright (Penn??) While I'm only vaguely familiar with the events following Lincoln's assassination in 1865, I do remember Ms. Surratt's hanging being historically relevant for many reasons.  First and foremost, she was a woman.  Redford often brings reference to modern times with the script and I'm certain that's no coincidence.

I fully expected that Robert Redford was going to use the trial of the Booth conspirators as an allegory tale to the current Guantanamo military tribunals and I signed up for that when I started watching.  What I did not expect was that Redford would succeed in making one of the most interesting events in American history boring.Redford gets so caught up in preaching that he forgets story telling.  He even goes so far as to omit the actual historical incident that could have been the dramatic climax to his movie:  One of the conspirators Paine stated ""Mrs. Surratt is innocent!  She doesn't deserve to die with the rest of us.....""  Popular myth has him saying it on the gallows (he said it in his cell) and Redford could have used that myth to drive home his point in a dramatic climax, yet he left it out.  Why?  I suspect because for the entire film the other conspirators in the movie could have been represented by cardboard cutouts, serving only to be shown as being led in and out hooded and then sitting like mannequins.  By the end of the movie its too late to give them  dialogue, even if that dialogue was critical to the theme of the movie.In fairness, I think the cast did the best they could, every once in a while you see glimpses of what this movie could have been. At times you can see the pain on their faces as they grope to find some life in this dry script.  However, at the end of the movie you just sit there and say ""Is that all there is?""  Hard to believe but this movie is so poorly scripted and edited at the end you see several people hung and you struggle to care.  You feel that this film commits a second murder, draining the life out of what should be a pivotal story in American History.",1,"How do you make this topic boring, I only wish I could give 0 stars",1315180800,"09 5, 2011",2011,1868,"['Civil', 'War', 'buff', 'anxiously', 'awaited', 'movie', 'was', 'surprised', 'went', 'local', 'theaters', 'so', 'fast', 'now', 'know', 'why', 'fully', 'expected', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'was', 'going', 'use', 'trial', 'Booth', 'conspirators', 'allegory', 'tale', 'current', 'Guantanamo', 'military', 'tribunals', 'signed', 'up', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'What', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'was', 'Redford', 'would', 'succeed', 'making', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'events', 'American', 'history', 'boring.Redford', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'preaching', 'story', 'telling', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'omit', 'actual', 'historical', 'incident', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'dramatic', 'climax', 'movie', 'One', 'conspirators', 'Paine', 'stated', 'Mrs.', 'Surratt', 'innocent', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'die', 'rest', '..', 'Popular', 'myth', 'saying', 'gallows', 'said', 'cell', 'Redford', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'myth', 'drive', 'home', 'point', 'dramatic', 'climax', 'yet', 'left', 'out', 'Why', 'suspect', 'entire', 'film', 'other', 'conspirators', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'represented', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'serving', 'only', 'be', 'shown', 'being', 'led', 'hooded', 'then', 'sitting', 'mannequins', 'end', 'movie', 'too', 'late', 'give', 'dialogue', 'even', 'dialogue', 'was', 'critical', 'theme', 'movie.In', 'fairness', 'think', 'cast', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'once', 'while', 'see', 'glimpses', 'what', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'times', 'can', 'see', 'pain', 'grope', 'find', 'life', 'dry', 'script', 'However', 'end', 'movie', 'just', 'sit', 'there', 'say', 'Hard', 'believe', 'movie', 'so', 'poorly', 'scripted', 'edited', 'end', 'see', 'several', 'people', 'hung', 'struggle', 'care', 'feel', 'film', 'second', 'murder', 'draining', 'life', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'pivotal', 'story', 'American', 'History']",N/A

Doyle ""film buff""","[2, 4]","Once again, the young actor JAMES McAVOY gives an earnest and altogether convincing portrait of a man assigned to be the defense lawyer for Mary Surratt, accused as one of the conspirators in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.Since the whole story is told from his point of view (and Redford's), it emerges as a somewhat biased look at how events might have unfolded, but taking no firm stand on the innocence or guilt of the accused. As the nation mourns the sudden death of its leader taken from them just as the Civil War ended, we are told that justice must be swift to heal the wounds of the public and satisfy a thirst for revenge. It's that viewpoint that makes this film relevant today, in view of other controversial historical events, but first and foremost the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.One glaring quibble: Apparently, to fully immerse the viewer in this time of history and to suit the flavor of the grim tale, Redford has chosen to use very muted color photography so that this is almost a sepia tone experience. But do we have to be reminded so flagrantly that this was the candlelit era? Scenes outside of the courtroom could have used flashes of real color, as could the social circle interiors of other scenes instead of keeping the low-key lighting so constant. It became a distraction for me. He may as well have used glorious B&W.;Other technical aspects are fine and the background score is effective without becoming overwhelming. ROBIN WRIGHT PENN plays Mary Surratt with quiet dignity and strength. KEVIN KLINE is almost unrecognizable as the stubbornly determined EDWIN STANTON seeking quick justice, EVAN RACHEL WOOD is effective as the distraught daughter Anna Surratt, and JOHNNY SIMMONS is sobering as the accused woman's son who manages to escape imprisonment for his role in the John Wilkes Booth caper. However, his character and motives are not fleshed out at all by the script, nor is his key relationship with his mother, Mary Surratt made at all clear.Biggest supporting role goes to TOM WILKINSON as the man who urges McAvoy to take the defense case against his wishes. He and McAvoy share most of the running time on screen and do magnificent jobs.History buffs will no doubt find this more interesting than the average movie fan looking for a more adventurous look at the past, but it is competently made, despite some flaws, and does recreate the actual events in a satisfying manner by use of flashbacks and an intelligent script.

They are usually an intertwining of multiple stories, all of which affect the case itself.  This can be said of this movie.  The title of the movie refers to Mary Surrat, who was tried and convicted of being part of the conspiracy to kill Abraham Lincoln.  Her case and her defense by Union war hero Frederick Aiken is only one key part of the movie.  Another key part is the internal tension within Mr. Aiken in trying to determine her innocence or guilt, and his conflicts with Mary and her daughter in trying to get them to tell him the truth.  This drama itself rivals that of the courtroom.  Smaller story-lines include the conflicts between Mr. Aiken and his peers, which include his girlfriend, his friends at a local gentleman's club, and the machinations of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.  The movie is anchored by great acting from numerous roles.  Lifelong comic actor Kevin Kline turns in a good performance as Edwin Stanton.  James McAvoy does a wonderful job playing lawyer Frederick Aiken, a character whose internal turmoil is only surpassed by the conflicts he has with those around him.  Probably the best acting is done by the two actresses; Robin Wright playing the ""Conspirator"", and Evan Rachel Wood playing her daughter.  The former sacrifices herself to protect her son, who she knows was intimately involved in a plot to kidnap President Lincoln.

The preachiness was annoying (although I actually agree that the government has no business suspending habeas corpus), but, from Robert Redford, I expected it.What I did not expect, though, was that someone could take as intense and tumultuous a time as the Civil War and make it flat and uninteresting. Frankly, my mind wandered a lot of the time, except when it was noting oddities like how Frederick Aiken was portrayed as a single man with a girlfriend, when in fact he was married at that time.In the end, I just found *The Conspirator* unconvincing, unengaging, and disappointing.

Far from ""vindicating the South and killing a tyrant"" as John Wilkes Booth and the other conspirators planned, it brought a ten year reign of hellfire down upon the South. Lincoln would doubtless have preferred ""malice toward none and charity for all"" but his death visited a decade of ""Reconstruction"" suffering upon the South, including the disenfranchisement of all who fought for the Confederacy from vindictive Republicans and Northern veterans who wanted punishment not mercy. Reconstruction poisoned race relations in the South for 100 years, but that's not a topic here. The assassination was the pivotal event that started it all.There were a number of conspirators, John Booth, John Sarratt, etc, and one, Mary Sarratt for whom there has never been any evidence that she conspired with the others. She owned and operated a boarding house on ""H"" St in Washington where the other conspirators met, but had no knowledge of their plans. Nevertheless there was a witch hunt by the military and the Republicans after the assassination, who saw more such rebellions lurking under each bridge and dark shadow. The military tribunal had reached the conclusion that all would hang before the ""trials"" started, most deservedly, but not Mary Sarratt. Seward, one if the targets of the conspirators, who was not killed in the assassination attempts, seems particularly motivated to see her hang.Her lawyer tried to defend her, question the ""evidence"", even gets a writ of habeas corpus to try her in a civilian court.Robert Redford's movie is a tense courtroom drama, all shot authentic with available light and gaslight.

1414364,A10OS2RVJT7J6W,B004LWZVZC,Raymond Sasso,"[0, 1]","I now have seen the movie after leaving a comment a couple of days ago, which I still stand by, because I think conspiracies abound all throughout history and we NEVER get the real or whole truth on the matter. Just like JFK, they pushed the Warren Commission to come up with its report so as to quiet a country, we find the same evidence here in the Lincoln assassination.I am a Civil War buff and know much more than the lay person on the facts, but I have to say, I knew very little about Mary Surratt then and now even more so after the film.  Robert Redford did a beautiful job recreating the events as best as possible in both look and feel, though no one is 100% on the mark after over a century and a half has gone by.  I have to admit that after I saw the movie, I couldn't get enough to read to see what I could come up with.I knew little of Mary Surratt and after the movie, I got to know more of her, but still, she had a mysterious way about her. There was one comment in the film where Aiken goes up to Stanton and as I forget his lead in line, but it was to protect Mary, he said, John or Mary, he didn't care as long as he got one of them! Now that should make you ears prick up right away! For the sake of expediency he was willing to sacrifice Mary for her son John so that the trial was over with and the country could move on, which it did. Oddly enough, when John did come back and got arrested, there were NO CHARGES brought against him and he went scott free. Now how could that be if he was the one who was in the middle of the group and was far more guilty than his mother, but it was over with and there was no need to go any further.I found it odd that the 7 defendants, only 4 were executed and 3 served little time! How could that be? What plagued me throughout the movie is that I could not tell if Mary knew more than she was admitting to. I seem to think that she did not know much more, and if tried by a jury of peers, as she should have been, she would not have been found guilty, let alone hanged! She was a religious woman and more so than people understand. She sent her children to Catholic schools to get the best education and religious training. This does not sound like a revengeful woman who would be in the thick of things in assassinating the President! Mind you, she did know a little more than let on, but it was nothing that would condemn her. She was a very protective mother and she only wanted to make sure that her son would be spared, so she took the fall for him.There were things that were brought up at the tribunal that in a court of law, would not have been admissible in court. The character backgrounds of the witnesses against her were either extremely flawed, or they out and out lied on the stand. I tend to think that if John Surratt had come back, his mother would have been let off on lesser charges...but it was not to be so and the trial went speedily to its conclusion. It was also odd that they tried all the defendants at the same time.I think everyone should see this movie, whether interested or not, to see how this happens again and again in our history and how the right of habeous corpous is thrown to the side for a swift resolution and lets the powers that be have their own way with the law. We've seen this right after JFK was assassinated and again soon after 9/11! Is our guaranteed Constitutional rights to be ignored when those in power deem it expedient to do so...and what they think is the best for the country, even though it may be a total lie? I feel this movie is trying to tell us that, from the very first time it happened to the American public.I can't say for sure, nor can anyone else, just how guilty Mary Surratt was. But I feel she was NOT that guilty to warrant the verdict put upon her and that history has a dark blotch because of it. If she was guilty of anything, it was protecting her son. All this movie did for me was bring up more and more questions on a subject I never thought about...but isn't that a good thing that we should question history as to its motives and try to find out as best we can, why they turned out the way they did? At the end, I felt nothing but pity for Mary, for she was the only one of the 4 that did NOT try and kill anyone and she was even more innocent than the other 3 who escaped without much of a punishment.

Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[0, 0]","The assassination of Abraham Lincoln at the end of our Civil War was probably one of the most emotionally and politically traumatizing events in our history up to that time. Lincoln, almost universally considered our best and most effective president, had led the country through the War; and Lee's army had just recently surrendered. In the aftermath of assassination, virtually everyone who had any connection to, or association with, John Wilkes Booth, the primary conspirator, was rounded up and incarcerated. There was a government-directed effort to rush to judgement...to get past the trial; punish the offenders; and return the country to normalcy ASAP. To expedite the trial, a military tribunal was used...the civilian perpetrators were tried in a military court, without benefit of trial by jury. Mary Surratt, who ran the boarding house where the conspirators met, was arrested and charged with conspiracy too and this fine historical drama tells her story. One of the conspirators, still at large, was her son, John, and the thinking was that charging and trying his mother would flush him out. It didn't, John Surratt was tried by jury a year later and walked. This is the first film produced by the American Film Company, which was founded on the noble belief that historical films are more compelling than fiction. It was masterfully crafted by Robert Redford behind the camera and features superb performances by Robin Wright as Mary Surratt; and James McAvoy, as her defense lawyer, Frederick Aiken. Evan Rachel Wood, Alexis Bledel, Tom Wilkinson and Kevin Kline deliver fine performances too in support roles. Hopefully this is just the first of other films of this nature to be produced during the sesquicentennial anniversary years of the Civil War.

1414370,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B004LWZVZC,Robin Friedman,"[77, 84]","Many Americans are using the year 2011, the 150th anniversary of the beginning of the Civil War, as an opportunity to reflect on the meanings of this seminal event in our history. ""The Conspirator"", a new movie directed by Robert Redford, examines the end of the Civil War rather than the beginning. The movie is set with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865 the conspiracy which planned it, and the ensuing military trials of the conspirators. The conspirators aimed to kill Vice-president Johnson and Secretary of State Seward in addition to the President and narrowly missed these goals. When John Wilkes Booth was killed, four conspirators were brought to trial including a woman, Mary Suratt, who kept a boarding house where the conspirators, among them her son, met to plan their activities. Mary Suratt's trial and the young lawyer who defended her, a Union officer in the War named Aiken, are the focus of this movie.Mary Suratt was not an appealing defendant in any circumstances, let alone under the fear which gripped Washington after the assassination.  She was an avowed Confederate sympathizer and did little to help her pleas of innocence. She argued essentially that keeping a boarding house is no crime and that she was unaware of what her boarders may have been doing behind closed doors in their rooms.Young Aiken took the case at the behest of venerable United States Senator from Maryland, Reverdy Johnson.  In the movie, Aiken at first shows substantial reluctance to become involved as he believes the evidence points strongly to Mary Suratt's guilt. Most historians who have since studied the matter share Aiken's initial reaction that Mary Suratt was guilty of conspiracy as charged. But Aiken pursues the case and sees good grounds to argue Suratt's innocence of conspiracy. He defends her with force, commitment, and great personal and professional cost to himself. Aiken fulfills the lawyerly mission of advocacy and defense for those unable to speak for themselves.The movie moves back in forth between testimony at the military hearing, the underlying events on which the testimony is based, and Aiken's efforts on behalf of Mary Suratt. In general, the story line is easy to follow. The portrayals of Aiken, Mary Suratt, and Secretary of War Stanton are good as are the depictions of Civil War era Washington, D.C. The scene in which the four conspirators are hung is particularly effective, especially in its use of the photographer Matthew Brady. Brady took a famous grizzly picture of the four conspirators hanging from their ropes which is echoed well in the movie.The movie can be viewed on several levels.  The film offers a good portrayal of the trial of Booth's conspirators, an event which may be unfamiliar to many Americans. The movie's sympathy towards Mary Suratt does not deprive it of accuracy. ""The Conspirators"" also has a contemporary focus. Redford draws parallels between the denial of civil liberties and fair judical process in the period following the assassination on the one hand and events in the United States following September 11, 2001, on the other hand. Viewers of the film may work through and consider the parallels.As a retired lawyer, the part of the movie that most interested me was young Aiken and the passion he put into Mary Suratt's defense. ""The Conspirators"" aptly calls attention to the nobility of the law, when well practiced. The defense of unpopular causes does not know ideological boundaries. I thought of a recent event postdating the movie in which a prestigious law firm withdrew due to pressure from the defense of a Federal statute called DOMA unpopular to some people. The distinguished lawyer assigned to the case then left the law firm so that he could continue his role of vigorous defense. It was this latter action rather than the former that met the ideals of the legal profession that Aiken followed so eloquently in his defense of Mary Suratt.Robin Friedman",4,The Conspirator,1304294400,"05 2, 2011",2011,3971,"['Many', 'Americans', 'are', 'using', 'year', '2011', '150th', 'anniversary', 'beginning', 'Civil', 'War', 'opportunity', 'reflect', 'meanings', 'seminal', 'event', 'history', 'Conspirator', 'new', 'movie', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'end', 'Civil', 'War', 'rather', 'beginning', 'movie', 'set', 'assassination', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'April', '14', '1865', 'conspiracy', 'planned', 'ensuing', 'military', 'trials', 'conspirators', 'conspirators', 'aimed', 'kill', 'Vice-president', 'Johnson', 'Secretary', 'State', 'Seward', 'addition', 'President', 'narrowly', 'missed', 'goals', 'When', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'was', 'killed', 'four', 'conspirators', 'were', 'brought', 'trial', 'including', 'woman', 'Mary', 'Suratt', 'who', 'kept', 'boarding', 'house', 'where', 'conspirators', 'son', 'met', 'plan', 'activities', 'Mary', 'Suratt', 'trial', 'young', 'lawyer', 'who', 'defended', 'Union', 'officer', 'War', 'named', 'Aiken', 'are', 'focus', 'movie.Mary', 'Suratt', 'was', 'not', 'appealing', 'defendant', 'circumstances', 'let', 'alone', 'fear', 'gripped', 'Washington', 'assassination', 'was', 'avowed', 'Confederate', 'sympathizer', 'did', 'little', 'help', 'pleas', 'innocence', 'argued', 'essentially', 'keeping', 'boarding', 'house', 'crime', 'was', 'unaware', 'what', 'boarders', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'closed', 'doors', 'rooms.Young', 'Aiken', 'took', 'case', 'behest', 'venerable', 'United', 'States', 'Senator', 'Maryland', 'Reverdy', 'Johnson', 'movie', 'Aiken', 'first', 'shows', 'substantial', 'reluctance', 'become', 'involved', 'evidence', 'points', 'strongly', 'Mary', 'Suratt', 'guilt', 'Most', 'historians', 'who', 'have', 'studied', 'matter', 'share', 'Aiken', 'initial', 'reaction', 'Mary', 'Suratt', 'was', 'guilty', 'conspiracy', 'charged', 'Aiken', 'case', 'sees', 'good', 'grounds', 'argue', 'Suratt', 'innocence', 'conspiracy', 'force', 'commitment', 'great', 'personal', 'professional', 'cost', 'Aiken', 'lawyerly', 'mission', 'advocacy', 'defense', 'unable', 'speak', 'themselves.The', 'movie', 'moves', 'back', 'forth', 'testimony', 'military', 'hearing', 'underlying', 'events', 'testimony', 'based', 'Aiken', 'efforts', 'behalf', 'Mary', 'Suratt', 'general', 'story', 'line', 'easy', 'follow', 'portrayals', 'Aiken', 'Mary', 'Suratt', 'Secretary', 'War', 'Stanton', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'depictions', 'Civil', 'War', 'era', 'Washington', 'D.C', 'scene', 'four', 'conspirators', 'are', 'hung', 'particularly', 'effective', 'especially', 'use', 'photographer', 'Matthew', 'Brady', 'Brady', 'took', 'famous', 'grizzly', 'picture', 'four', 'conspirators', 'hanging', 'ropes', 'echoed', 'well', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'several', 'levels', 'film', 'good', 'portrayal', 'trial', 'Booth', 'conspirators', 'event', 'may', 'be', 'unfamiliar', 'many', 'Americans', 'movie', 'sympathy', 'towards', 'Mary', 'Suratt', 'not', 'deprive', 'accuracy', 'Conspirators', 'also', 'contemporary', 'focus', 'Redford', 'parallels', 'denial', 'civil', 'liberties', 'fair', 'judical', 'process', 'period', 'following', 'assassination', 'one', 'hand', 'events', 'United', 'States', 'following', 'September', '11', '2001', 'other', 'hand', 'Viewers', 'film', 'may', 'work', 'consider', 'parallels.As', 'retired', 'lawyer', 'part', 'movie', 'most', 'interested', 'was', 'young', 'Aiken', 'passion', 'put', 'Mary', 'Suratt', 'defense', 'Conspirators', 'aptly', 'attention', 'nobility', 'law', 'when', 'well', 'practiced', 'defense', 'unpopular', 'causes', 'not', 'know', 'ideological', 'boundaries', 'thought', 'recent', 'event', 'postdating', 'movie', 'prestigious', 'law', 'firm', 'withdrew', 'due', 'pressure', 'defense', 'Federal', 'statute', 'called', 'DOMA', 'unpopular', 'people', 'distinguished', 'lawyer', 'assigned', 'case', 'then', 'left', 'law', 'firm', 'so', 'could', 'continue', 'role', 'vigorous', 'defense', 'was', 'latter', 'action', 'rather', 'former', 'met', 'ideals', 'legal', 'profession', 'Aiken', 'followed', 'so', 'eloquently', 'defense', 'Mary', 'Suratt.Robin', 'Friedman']",N/A

We see no real connection between her and her children, only a story of their drunken father and her attempts to make a living told within the cold stone walls of her prison cell.Whether she was guilty or not, we may never truly know.  Many versions of her story abound, but in the end, history is written from the standpoint of the victors. We all know - or should know - that.  Evidence has even been presented suggesting Boothe survived long after Lincoln's assassination, evidence with historical backing, but like the evidence in Surrat's case, it has been buried once more.This could easily turn into an argument of defending assassins, conspirators and such, but the greatest lesson to come from this movie remains.  That lesson is that from Mrs. Surrat's trial came the defense of one of our greatest rights:  The right to a trial by jury in peacetime OR war.  She may have been guilty, but the process of her trial was unfair and unconstitutional.I don't ""blame the government"" as some one star reviewers suggest. I'm not anti-government. In fact, I am grateful that at long last, decent officials finally realized the injustice of Mrs. Surrat's trial and they agreed to stand for the rights of all by declaring trials like hers would not happen again.This movie should be viewed as entertainment first, given historical inaccuracies (even the best historical movie has them), but secondly as a chance for us to delve deeper into history. Movies like this one should prompt us to think, to discuss and more importantly to LEARN not just the ""victor's"" point of view, but also the ""loser's.""All that said, please allow me to interject what I feel is a bit of humor.

That said, this is very good film that maybe works because of Redford's style, telling the story of the lone female accused of being part of the conspiracy to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. Mary Surratt (Robin Wright, in a nicely nuanced performance) ran the boarding house where John Wilkes Booth and his co-conspirators (including Mary's own son) plan Lincoln's (as well as other) assassination, and when her son escapes justice its almost as if the law arrests Mary in his place. She swears she had no knowledge of any of the plans discussed in her own home, and with even her court-appointed attorney (James McAvoy) unsure of what to believe, the case against Mary Surratt heads to trial as he tries to find evidence of her innocence. Not just a courtroom melodrama, the film features some fine performances, and nice suspense as McAvoy pokes around and finds evidence that comes more and more to make him believe Mary may have been set up ... though whether it will help or not, when the powers that be have already tried and convicted Mary in their heads, is a different matter.",4,Nice courtroom drama about one of history's most infamous crimes,1356912000,"12 31, 2012",2012,1200,"['Robert', 'Redford', 'films', 'always', 'come', 'off', 'very', 'dry', 'stoic', 'little', 'genuinely-felt', 'emotional', 'content', 'said', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'maybe', 'Redford', 'style', 'telling', 'story', 'lone', 'female', 'accused', 'being', 'part', 'conspiracy', 'assassinate', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Mary', 'Surratt', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'nicely', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'ran', 'boarding', 'house', 'where', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'co-conspirators', 'including', 'Mary', 'own', 'son', 'plan', 'Lincoln', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'assassination', 'when', 'son', 'justice', 'almost', 'law', 'Mary', 'place', 'had', 'knowledge', 'plans', 'discussed', 'own', 'home', 'even', 'court-appointed', 'attorney', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'unsure', 'what', 'believe', 'case', 'Mary', 'Surratt', 'heads', 'trial', 'find', 'evidence', 'innocence', 'Not', 'just', 'courtroom', 'melodrama', 'film', 'fine', 'performances', 'nice', 'suspense', 'McAvoy', 'around', 'evidence', 'more', 'more', 'make', 'believe', 'Mary', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'will', 'help', 'not', 'when', 'powers', 'be', 'have', 'already', 'tried', 'convicted', 'Mary', 'heads', 'different', 'matter']",N/A

But much of the film is moving and interesting.I liked the film's opening, which shows Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy) wounded on a Civil War battlefield, followed by celebrations after Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox. Aiken soon is defending Mary Surratt (Robin Wright), the owner of the the Washington boarding house in which the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln was planned in April, 1865. Much of the film then takes place in Surratt's jail cell and in the courtroom.Tom Wilkinson (as Senator Reverdy Johnson of Maryland, whose patriotism is questioned), Kevin Kline (as Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton), and Evan Rachel Wood (as Surratt's daughter) are excellent in supporting roles, and McAvoy is quite good in the lead role.

1414386,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B004LWZVZC,Steven Hancock,"[5, 6]","In the days following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the administration saw to it that the people involved were hunted down like dogs. But in their thirst for ""justice,"" some that were possibly innocent also became victims of the war. One of those was Mary Surratt, mother of John Surratt, one of the conspirators. The trial of Mary Surratt and five other conspirators is the subject of the courtroom drama ""The Conspirator,"" the first film from The American Film Company. Directed by Oscar winner Robert Redford, the film features an all-star cast including Robin Wright (""The Princess Bride"") as Surratt; James McAvoy (""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" ""Wanted"") as Civil War veteran and Surratt attorney Frederick Aiken; Danny Huston (""John Adams,"" ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"") as prosecutor Joseph Holt; Tom Wilkinson (""John Adams,"" ""The Patriot"") as Reverdy Johnson; and Kevin Kline (""Silverado,"" ""Dave"") as Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.The film begins with a well-staged recreation of the assassination of Lincoln, as well as the attempted assassinations of Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward. The film then quickly goes through the chase and death of Booth, and the arrests of the other conspirators involved. But the bulk of the film is taken up by the trial of the conspirators, and it is here where the film really shines. The acting, cinematography and directing all come together perfectly in these scenes, creating a vivid portrayal of the trial, and showing how this was not really a case of finding the truth, but of finding all those on trial, including Surratt, guilty and sentenced to death.While all the performances in the film are terrific, the best comes from Kevin Kline's portrayal of Stanton. Here, we see a man out for blood, and who doesn't care if a person is possibly innocent or not. Although those on the war tribunal wanted to be lenient on Surratt on grounds of her age and gender, Stanton ""convinced"" them to pronounce the death sentence on her. And when Aiken was successful in having a Writ of Habeas Corpus signed by a judge to give Surratt another trial in a civilian court, you can tell that Stanton was the one who convinced President Johnson to have it more or less vetoed. Even if you don't outright hate Stanton, you strongly despise the man, which is a great testament to the acting by Kline.The attention to historical detail is very telling in this movie. From costume design to set decoration to military drill and uniforms, you really get a sense that the production team did their research, creating a 19th Century world vividly. While the film does have one or two inaccuracies (The Writ was given to General Winfield Scott Hancock, not to Stanton), and the film does have its slower moments, ""The Conspirator"" is an outstanding film that presents this little-known story from our history with terrific performances, fine storytelling, a strong sense of attention to historical accuracy, and excellent direction from Redford.

He's an excellent director. His movies always entertain and engage me -- they are thoughtful and beautiful and he gets wonderful performances out of excellent actors.This was no disappointment. I had never heard of Mary Surrat and her fate as an accomplice in the assassination of Lincoln. It's a true story and the movie draws tight the tension between justice and expediency. Expediency wins. The film depicts how the powerful can bend justice and forsake it for what they consider a higher purpose, or, in this case, it's implied, for revenge.This is a fact of life in any age. I think that's what Redford is saying -- it's in America's dna -- the forsaking of the principles of the Constitutional rights of individuals on the whim of the powerful in certain moments of history. James McAvoy is wonderful as the young lawyer who is at first ordered to defend Mary Suratt, and then embraces his job realizing the hazard and danger for all when the rights of one person are trampled.Robin Wright is stoic and heroic as Mary Surratt, she nails the character ... beautiful performance.Kevin Kline disappears into the character of Seward, giving a masterful performance as the secretary of state whose stated motive for railroading Mary is to preserve peace after the civil war and to keep southerners in their place, so to speak.The cast shines, and the movie is true to period, very enjoyable, and, also, sad, compassionate, and --- warning, another spoiler -- McAvoy's character, after the farce of a ""trial"", left the law and became the first editor of the Washington Post...dedicated to truth as a newspaperman...a noble profession that I hope survives this age!

This was done so the audience would get a feel about how rushed the trial had become. James McAvoy plays Frederick Aiken, the Union officer forced to defend Mary. He believes she is guilty. Mary (Robin Wright) is a quiet woman who is a solid block of courage. She is a rebel sympathizer. The conspiracy meetings took place at her boarding house. The movie shows her face during the trial with occasional outbursts. This was not the case. Her face was veiled during most of the trial and during the testimony of her daughter Anna. However, no woman in Hollywood wants to play that role, so they had her unveiled.Robin Wright looked very much like the depiction we have of Mary Surratt. Noticed how the Secretary of Defense took charge of the situation after the assassination and would allow the VP to take over when he said so. The acting was good and the historical dress and background characters seemed to be accurate down to the straw hats worn by the hangmen.Robert Redford just doesn't choose movies to direct because he thinks they would make good movies. The movies are selected in order to make comparisons to our world today. The question of the legality of the military court for the conspirators is the same legal question that exists today for those at Guantanamo. Just substitute 9-11 for the assassination, and Muslims for confederates. There were threats of biological warfare and ""the world has forever changed."" Mr. Aiken claims how his prisoner is mistreated. It is countered by ""How you forgotten how our people are treated by the rebels?"" Mary is ""Catholic."" She wears black from head to toe.

In The Conspirator Mary Seuratt is denied a civil trial and is tried by the military at the behest of Sec. of War Stanton who states he wants to preserve the newly won peace.  (The Supreme Court later upholds a citizen's right to a civilian trial according to a note at the end of the film). Stanton also works with Pres. Andrew Johnson to deny a writ of habeas corpus submitted by Seuratt's attorney in a last ditch effort to save her from being hanged.Part of the message from the film is to remind us, particularly after 9/11, that we have this recurring theme in our history of ""bending"" the Constitution when events cause our emotions to run high.  We are reminded that the rights of all citizens are protected in that Constitution.

After the assassination of President Lincoln the entire country is looking for someone to blame. A trial of the conspirators takes place. Young lawyer Frederick Aiken (McAvoy) is picked to defend the lone woman Mary Surratt (Wright). When he begins to believe that she is innocent can he do enough to convince the military court? Being a huge history buff I was looking forward to this movie and it did not disappoint. Opening with the assassination then moving quickly to the trial this movie had me interested from the beginning. The aspects of trial are as relevant today as they were at the time. Without trying to give anything away the judges go in with a verdict in mind and will stop at nothing to get it. Aiken does everything he can to let Mary go free, but everyone is working against him. This is another movie that exposes the flaws in the justice system. For history buffs you will really enjoy this movie. For the casual watcher this is one of the better courtroom movies to come out in a while. This is a very, very good movie.

In the extra features, Redford said he was going for a deliberately musty look to the sets, unfortunately resulting in an &#34;Antiques Roadshow&#34; vibe that weighs the film down like a lead ball while leaching the visceral impact of every scene. But the film is certainly well-cast with many familiar TV and cinema faces. James McAvoy is good as the idealistic young lawyer assigned to defend Mary Surratt, a Southern Catholic widow who ran the boarding house where John Wilkes Booth and friends planned the death of Abraham Lincoln, leaving herself as the only female conspirator charged in military court with treason. Redford analogizes the post-assassination backlash of 1865 to present-day abuse of civil liberties. Rather than taking sides for or against Surratt, played here with iron resolve by Robin Wright Penn, Redford lets her remain distant, trying to suggest her guilt and innocence simultaneously. Ironically, the greater historicity here means weakened drama, for which Redford relies on Kevin Kline in a clearly villainous role as War Secretary Edwin Stanton. It creates a weird sense of disconnect to see Stanton consistently played as a villain while Surratt is played as an enigma rather than hero. It's a good film, but not great. Daniel Day-Lewis probably did a better job in &#34;Lincoln&#34; because of his efforts to provide insights into Lincoln's character. This film refuses to give us real insight into anyone except McAvoy, whose gradual transformation comes across here as a touch more self-righteous than genuine.

1414398,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004LWZVZC,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""The Conspirator"" is the first film produced by American Film Company established in 2008, and if you watch the film's end credits closely (or visit the company's homepage), you know the new studio is primarily interested in making historically accurate films based on American history.The story itself is an intriguing one. Set in post-Civil War Washington, ""The Conspirator"" is about a young attorney Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy), who reluctantly defends Mary Surratt (Robin Wright), a boarding house owner who was accused of harboring the men responsible for the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.Directed by Robert Redford, the film spends considerable time following the change that happens in Frederick, from an indifferent and inexperienced young lawyer to a passionate and dedicated one. His transformation is convincing, largely thanks to James McAvoy's effecting performance, but with courtroom drama that often feels rushed, ""The Conspirator"" as a historical drama sometimes seems not really interested in whether Mary is ""guilty"" - legally or morally - or not. Some characters like Frederick's friend Sarah Weston (Alexis Bledel) are flat and one-dimensional, making the main plotline a bit melodramatic at times.Most viewers will notice the message from the director (whose previous effort was a political drama ""Lions for Lambs""): a message relevant to the present day, especially the post 9/11 political climate. You will not miss the point, and once you get it, there is not much that will make you think.I really don't know what to say about ""The Conspirator,"" of which fact-based plot is certainly intriguing, but the result is rather dry.

1414399,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B004LWZVZC,Turfseer,"[83, 110]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***I was very much looking forward to seeing 'The Conspirator' and even went out and purchased an audio book, 'The Assassin's Accomplice' , which I listened to before seeing the film. As a history buff, I find books about such memorable historical events as the Lincoln assassination quite fascinating. Unfortunately, due to budgetary constraints, Director Robert Redford and his creative team were unable to focus on the meat and potatoes of the story: that is, the events leading up to the actual assassination itself. Instead, Redford has offered up a quickie montage of the conspirators' machinations, with the bulk of the film concentrating on the aftermath of President Lincoln's tragic demise--specifically the trial and execution of the principal actors in the assassination plot.What's missing in this by-the-numbers history is a sense of who the conspirators were--their personalities and the context of the times they lived in. Instead, the main protagonist is a defense attorney, Frederick Aiken, who defended Mary Surratt, a principal conspirator in the Lincoln assassination who also happened to be the first woman ever executed by the US government. Most of the film focuses on Aiken's anguish over his perception that Mary Surratt was not treated fairly by the government, especially in regards to the fact that she was tried in front of a military commission and not a civilian jury. Redford obviously wants us to draw a parallel between the events that occurred in 1865 and today's recent controversy over whether the 9/11 conspirators (and Gitmo detainees) should be classified as enemy combatants and tried before military tribunals. In Redford's analysis, the post-Civil War government (and particularly the military) are the bad guys. What Redford conveniently fails to point out, is that perhaps the greatest usurper of the Constitution at that time was Abraham Lincoln himself (as the President suspended Habeas corpus for the entire duration of the Civil War--abrogating the right of the courts to determine if the custodian of persons in detention has the lawful authority to keep said detainees behind bars).After the montage of the events leading up to the assassination, we get a few flashbacks during the trial dramatizing what went on before and after President Lincoln's murder. It was well established during the trial that Mary Surratt met with John Wilkes Booth on numerous occasions at her boarding house in Washington, D.C., and in the hands of a professional screenwriter, that relationship could have been fleshed out. But instead, we catch only fleeting glimpses of Booth and find out virtually nothing about him. By failing to show Booth's relationship with both Mary Surratt and her son, John, one gets the wrong impression that Mary was an innocent victim in this whole affair. The fact remains that the conspirators promoted the beliefs of the Confederacy, a cause infused with racism. Is it possible that Redford sugar coats Mary Surratt and her co-conspirators so that we don't come away with the impression that they are racists? (For example, Lewis Payne, the conspirator who almost stabbed Secretary of State Seward to death on the night of Lincoln's assassination, was arrested in Baltimore a few weeks before the assassination--Payne almost beat an African-American cleaning woman to death because, in his mind, she was getting 'too uppity'-why leave something like that out?)I have no objection to screenwriters playing fast and loose with history in order to enhance dramatic events. One such example in 'The Conspirator' is that Mary Surratt is shown during the film without the black veil which she wore at the trial, completely covering her face. Historically, Surratt only lifted the veil during the trial when called upon to identify herself before the Court. Dramatically it would not have worked in the film had her face remained covered , so I had no problem with the films' scenarists depicting Mary without her face covered. But I did have a big problem with the scene in which Mary admits to Aiken that she was aware of Booth's kidnapping plot (Booth's initial plan was to kidnap Lincoln and hold him for ransom). The fact is that Mary Surratt made no such admissions--she provided no explanations whatsoever as to her conduct before and after the assassination. Because she failed to provide any plausible explanation for her conduct and continuously denied any culpability, her attorneys were unable to mount a serious defense. By falsely suggesting that Mary Surratt admitted to an awareness of the Booth kidnapping plot, Redford can conveniently imply that she took some responsibility for her involvement with the conspirators, without having to admit any knowledge of or involvement in the actual assassination.Perhaps it would would have been a much better film had the films' scenarists made Louis Weichmann the protagonist, not Aiken. Weichmann, a Federal employee, was friends with Mary and John Surratt and was living at the boardinghouse at the time of the assassination. After the trial, and for the rest of his life, he was forced to defend himself from both southern sympathizers who held him responsible for Mary Surratt's death due to his testimony against her at the trial and those northerners who suspected he was part of the conspiracy with John Surratt.'The Conspirator' is not a complete lost cause. For one who wants to learn about the basics surrounding the Lincoln Assassination and the conspirator's trial, the film does a fair job in highlighting the principal events. What's more, there are some excellent performances here--especially Robin Wright as Mary, Tom Wilkinson as Reverdy Johnson (Mary's chief attorney) and Kevin Kline, who has a brief part as Lincoln's Secretary of War.Was she or wasn't she guilty? That's a question 'The Conspirator' manages to skirt almost entirely. The evidence suggests a strong circumstantial case against Mary Surratt. Her death sentence is another issue. But for Robert Redford, Surratt is a victim of government injustice and thus her actual guilt is of little concern.",2,Redford is more concerned with US govt 'injustice' than actual guilt of Lincoln

What a mistake, i've always disliked Robert Redford movies for the simple fact that they are long winded and flat out boring. This movie is no exception, and has been mainly accused of wearing out the audience because of it's stage (broadway like) presentation. Which it basically is. I wanted to see a movie about the history of Abraham Lincoln, not just another assassination movie where they show a guy dressed up as Lincoln who never speaks, but just gets killed. Again that's what happens here. This isn't a spoiler, it's just a movie about the people who conspired to kill the President, and it's just not very well executed in the least. It compares itself to Kill A Mockingbird, and A Time To Kill as a great court room thriller, but is anything but that. It's bland, the acting is very cardboardish, and TV like, bordering on poor. And by the time the movie ends, if you can make it that far, you just look back on it and really don't care. You basically say, it was ok, walk off and never speak of it again. Next time give us, the fans with Lincoln actually in it, and then have the assassination at the end. That would be a lot more exciting, since in this time period it's really irrelevant WHO killed Lincoln. Since we know.Yes it says August 13th. Pay Per View people.

It can have been the most haunting film to tell of this period, an event that, if true, can be of the more tragic in U.S. history. But this movie feels like a made-for-television production.  One appreciates the attention to detail, the effort to make a visual and believable historical film but they can and should have raised the level of dialog above the 'usual'.",2,Diappointing dialoge and acting,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,468,"['thought', 'provoking', 'story', 'woman', 'hanged', 'co-conspirator', 'President', 'Lincoln', 'assassination', 'can', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'haunting', 'film', 'tell', 'period', 'event', 'true', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'tragic', 'U.S.', 'history', 'movie', 'made-for-television', 'production', 'One', 'attention', 'detail', 'effort', 'make', 'visual', 'believable', 'historical', 'film', 'can', 'should', 'have', 'raised', 'level', 'dialog', ""'usual""]",N/A
1414404,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B004LWZVZC,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","Robert Redford's ""The Conspirator"" (2010) is about the only woman to be charged as a co-conspirator in Lincoln's assassination. Mary Surratt (Robin Wright) ran the boarding house where her son, John (Johnny Simmons), regularly met with John Wilkes Booth and others plotting their seditious deeds. Mary Claims she simply ran a boarding house and didn't know what her tenants and their friends were hatching. The young lawyer assigned to defend her, Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy), knows that she probably knew more, but also that there's not enough evidence to convict her and, by extension, execute her.The film starts with Lincoln's assassination and the search for Booth, but then settles into a courtroom drama. I found the first half engrossing enough for a historical drama, but it was the second half that really hooked me in when I discovered that ""The Conspirator"" wasn't just about the Surratt family. It's just as much about Aiken's determination to do what's right, whatever the cost, and the consequences of this decision.At only 27 years of age, I'm sure those who assigned Aiken the job of defending Mary Surratt weren't expecting much, especially since he fought for the North and despised the rebellion. He was a puppet expected to just go-through-the-motions of defending Surratt. But, as Aiken discovers that there's really not enough evidence to convict Mary and observes the outright corruption of the prosecution, Aiken understands that there's more than just Mary Surratt's life at stake. If she could be railroaded and executed so easily in the land of the free, anyone could.But there's a hefty price for doing what's right if it goes against the grain of popular opinion.Alexis Bledel also stars as Aiken's woman and Evan Rachel Wood as Mary's daughter, both excellent.The film was shot in Georgia and runs 122 minutes.FINAL SAY: ""The Conspirator"" does exactly what a good historical drama should do -- it takes the viewer back into the historical world of the characters and does it effectively and realistically. It also prompts you to look into the facts of the real-life events afterward. Even more, the potent subtexts are driven home.GRADE: B+",4,When doing what's right makes you an outcast,1368403200,"05 13, 2013",2013,2174,"['Robert', 'Redford', 'Conspirator', '2010', 'only', 'woman', 'be', 'charged', 'co-conspirator', 'Lincoln', 'assassination', 'Mary', 'Surratt', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'ran', 'boarding', 'house', 'where', 'son', 'John', 'Johnny', 'Simmons', 'regularly', 'met', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'others', 'plotting', 'seditious', 'deeds', 'Mary', 'Claims', 'simply', 'ran', 'boarding', 'house', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'tenants', 'friends', 'were', 'hatching', 'young', 'lawyer', 'assigned', 'defend', 'Frederick', 'Aiken', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'probably', 'knew', 'more', 'also', 'not', 'enough', 'evidence', 'convict', 'extension', 'execute', 'her.The', 'film', 'Lincoln', 'assassination', 'search', 'Booth', 'then', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'found', 'first', 'half', 'engrossing', 'enough', 'historical', 'drama', 'was', 'second', 'half', 'really', 'hooked', 'when', 'discovered', 'Conspirator', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'Surratt', 'family', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Aiken', 'determination', 'do', 'what', ""'s"", 'right', 'whatever', 'cost', 'consequences', 'decision.At', 'only', '27', 'years', 'age', ""'m"", 'sure', 'who', 'assigned', 'Aiken', 'job', 'defending', 'Mary', 'Surratt', 'were', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'especially', 'fought', 'North', 'despised', 'rebellion', 'was', 'puppet', 'expected', 'just', 'go-through-the-motions', 'defending', 'Surratt', 'Aiken', 'really', 'not', 'enough', 'evidence', 'convict', 'Mary', 'outright', 'corruption', 'prosecution', 'Aiken', 'more', 'just', 'Mary', 'Surratt', 'life', 'stake', 'could', 'be', 'railroaded', 'executed', 'so', 'easily', 'land', 'free', 'anyone', 'could.But', 'hefty', 'price', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'grain', 'popular', 'opinion.Alexis', 'Bledel', 'also', 'Aiken', 'woman', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Mary', 'daughter', 'excellent.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Georgia', '122', 'minutes.FINAL', 'SAY', 'Conspirator', 'exactly', 'what', 'good', 'historical', 'drama', 'should', 'do', 'viewer', 'back', 'historical', 'world', 'characters', 'effectively', 'realistically', 'also', 'look', 'facts', 'real-life', 'events', 'afterward', 'Even', 'more', 'potent', 'subtexts', 'are', 'driven', 'home.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A

It allowed one to see the turmoil this Union Soldier, turned lawyer was facing in the hysteria. It shows how easily people will allow themselves to be manipulated by unquestionably believing published newspaper articles about others or incidents.

Unfortunately, this courtroom drama fails in a number of aspects, with acting being first and foremost on that list.For a basic plot summary, ""The Conspirator"" tells the story of Mary Surratt (Robin Wright), accused of harboring the men who conspired to kill President Lincoln.  With all the odds stacked against her, Surratt is given a military trial that she has no hope of winning.  The only thing in her corner is lawyer Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy), who is persuaded to fight for her cause.As a courtroom drama, this film is okay.  It touches on a few interesting themes and really shows the mood of the Civil War era.  However, the acting is so poor that it never really sucks viewers into the proceedings.  Besides Wright as Surratt, the acting performances fail in a variety of ways.  McAvoy does not convey ""period"" whatsoever, the auxiliary cast isn't given much to do, and the laughable casting choices of Justin Long and Alexis Bledel only serves to further exemplify the acting in this effort.Also, ""The Conspirator"" does none of the ""little things"" right, like character depth.  A romance angle with McAvoy's character goes nowhere, for instance, while the drama of the film is confined to the courtroom scenes and no others.Thus, I cannot recommend ""The Conspirator"" to those looking for anything more than a mediocre, stuffy period piece about a very specific topic.
