1326412,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0035JHYGQ,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","Tenderness isn't exactly what I was expecting.  It's not really a detective movie in the sense that it focuses entirely on Russell Crowe's character searching for a psychotic killer.  This is only one piece of the puzzle... a rather confusing and twisted puzzle.Instead, what *really* takes up the majority of the storyline is this young man (the psychotic killer) who drives around in a car with a 16-year old girl. The girl happened to jump in the back seat without the killer knowing about it (and nearly causing a wreck as you will quickly recover) and the two of them drive around... wherever, trying to figure out where exactly the psychotic killer met this girl before.  She gives him the clues, but he never remembers.  The girl reveals to him her story about a bridge and a river, but apparently he can't remember it no matter what.There's other interesting moments of suspense, such as the psychotic killer killing his parents and showing only a slightly graphic portion of how it happens.The storyline, from what I gathered at least, is mainly a neverending list of reflections.  Everything seems to focus on remembering the past, and how the girl and the killer got to this point in their lives, and where they go from here.  This occurs by way of the two of them -like I said above- travelling to forest, bowling alleys, motels, carnivals, etc.I have mixed feelings about the ending.  I feel somewhat cheated to be honest because I was expecting a satisfying conclusion by way of a moment of terrific suspense, but... without spoiling anything, it's anything but.  I guess the one thing I didn't quite understand is the *very* last scene before the credits rolled.  I get the feeling I missed an important piece of the puzzle there.Anyway, Tenderness is a pretty solid film.  It will constantly keep you guessing (and confused) but hey, that's why it's a free country and you can continue to watch it over and over as many times as you wish until everything about it makes perfect sense.",5,enjoyable suspense,1308960000,"06 25, 2011",2011,2000,"['Tenderness', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'not', 'really', 'detective', 'movie', 'sense', 'entirely', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'character', 'searching', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'only', 'one', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'rather', 'confusing', 'twisted', 'puzzle.Instead', 'what', '*really*', 'up', 'majority', 'storyline', 'young', 'man', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'who', 'around', 'car', '16-year', 'old', 'girl', 'girl', 'happened', 'jump', 'back', 'seat', 'killer', 'knowing', 'nearly', 'causing', 'wreck', 'will', 'quickly', 'recover', 'two', 'drive', 'wherever', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'exactly', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'met', 'girl', 'clues', 'never', 'remembers', 'girl', 'reveals', 'story', 'bridge', 'river', 'apparently', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'matter', 'other', 'interesting', 'moments', 'suspense', 'such', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'killing', 'parents', 'showing', 'only', 'slightly', 'graphic', 'portion', 'how', 'storyline', 'what', 'gathered', 'least', 'mainly', 'neverending', 'list', 'reflections', 'Everything', 'focus', 'remembering', 'past', 'how', 'girl', 'killer', 'got', 'point', 'lives', 'where', 'go', 'here', 'way', 'two', '-like', 'said', 'above-', 'travelling', 'forest', 'bowling', 'alleys', 'motels', 'carnivals', 'etc.I', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'ending', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'cheated', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'expecting', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'way', 'moment', 'terrific', 'suspense', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'anything', 'guess', 'one', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', '*very*', 'last', 'scene', 'credits', 'rolled', 'get', 'feeling', 'missed', 'important', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'there.Anyway', 'Tenderness', 'pretty', 'solid', 'film', 'will', 'constantly', 'keep', 'guessing', 'confused', 'hey', 'why', 'free', 'country', 'can', 'continue', 'watch', 'as', 'many', 'times', 'wish', 'everything', 'perfect', 'sense']",Tenderness

1326415,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B0035JHYGQ,Compay,"[0, 0]","The first thing to know about Tenderness is that it's a crime drama, not an edge-of-your seat thriller. While it does offer suspense from time to time, don't expect Silence of the Lambs.What I found most interesting about this movie were the compulsions by the major characters. A self-destructive teen obsessed with a murderer, a young man obsessed with killing girls, and a weary detective obsessed with keeping the young man behind bars.In the film From Dusk Till Dawn, we get glimpses of compulsions by Tarantino's character. With Eric in Tenderness, those compulsions are amplified. We're able to see the wheels turn in his head whenever opportunities for him to murder present themselves. He battles his inner demons with a sense of confliction so apparent that you can see it in his face. Those feelings, as well as the disturbing vibe of his admirer, make for an interesting movie.The movie isn't a cult classic, of course. There are a few plot holes, as well as established actors who get only moments of screen time. My only real complaint is that we're given a sense of how disturbed the two lead characters are, but the film never delves into what made them that way. Eric doesn't seem to require state-mandated therapy for chemical imbalances, so the audience never fully understands what motivates him to kill.If you're looking for an exciting crime drama, this may not be for you. If you're looking for something more in the way of a subtle psychological thriller, Tenderness is better than most movies that go straight to video.

Russell Crowe, Jon Foster, Laura Dern, and Sophie Taub all give riveting performances.  All these characters hold so much pain and sorrow that it's almost unbearable to watch.  Director John Polson, without flinching, shows us the tortured psyche of a sociopath and yet finds the &#34;Tenderness&#34; even in that heart.  Each character, at one point or another, is good and noble.  Their flaws are heartbreakingly raw and human.  The surprising twist at the end brings home the tragedy of this story.

1326419,A5QCKO0LL1D5E,B0035JHYGQ,dv_forever,"[3, 3]","Russell Crowe plays a cop with no life and a vegetable for a wife. He's obsessed with this young killer who has been released from juveline correction. Jon Foster plays the killer whose emotional life is so damaged he can't connect to human beings in any normal, society approved capacity. Foster's portrayal of his character has an emotional coolness as well as a vulnerability about him, so it's easy to sympathize with him. He resorts back to his ways of thinking and moving around in the world immediately upon gaining his freedom. His aunt, played by Laura Dern, is obviously disturbed to be around him. Foster takes a road trip and meets perhaps the most bizarre character of the film, a young girl played by actress Sophie Traub. She's a strange female character one rarely sees in films like these. Instead of being disturbed by this psychopathic killer, she's in love with him and practically begging to be his victim. Damaged goods they are. Everyone is damaged goods in this film, just like in real life. The story is about taking chances in life as well as getting second chances and still making the same mistakes over and over. It can be depressing but it's honest.I found the movie involving. It doesn't try to be a conventional thriller or cop on the hunt film. It's obvious that the characters are what's important here and not some cheap thriller elements. The screenplay accomplishes this well and the actors bring their characters to life most vividly. The photography was also well done. Just look at the scene in the woods with Russell Crowe snooping near the abandoned trailer.The biggest emotion I came away with from this little movie is the title itself, tenderness. The treatment of the tragic nature of this story and it's twisted characters, did not in any way feel exploitive or ham-fisted.

1326420,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0035JHYGQ,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 6]","Though we find ourselves more and more squeamish these days, a good detective thriller now and then is beneficial. TENDERNESS is not one of those. I consider this a B-movie at best, though today we know such films by the ironically psychotic term ""indie"".Russell Crowe, fallen so far from the work he did in THE INSIDER and A BEAUTIFUL MIND, plays retired Lieutenant Cristofuoro, a silent, reflective cop who cares for his dying wife while obsessing about a newly released 'juvenile offender'.The offender, Eric (played by Jon Foster) is a sexually crazed psychopathic killer. In a most idiotic and unrealistic turn of events, he is held in juvie until his 18th birthday...get this...for the cold-blooded double murder of his parents. It is his 18th birthday and despite warnings from the lieutenant, Eric-the-Sicko is released without any strings attached. And incidentally, he murdered his mother because she knew about his other murders. Then he murdered his father because his father walked in just in time.This serial killer is released into the custody of his Aunt Teresa (a pointless cameo by Laura Dern)--she fears him, yet there he is living with her. His plans are to find a college...and miracle of miracles, even the media is totally left out of this pathetic excuse for a story. Apparently even in the pretend-land of film, no one was interested.So much for any sane realism in this story.Criss-crossed with weird and frankly pathetic flashback work, we are introduced to an even sicker individual, 15-year-old Lori (Sophie Traub). She is a potential star-crossed lover for Eric, but only because she herself is an inwardly turned psychopath: she hopes he will love her enough to kill her. She even keeps a loving scrapbook following details about Eric-the-Psycho, and immediately sets off to stalk him the moment he is free.From here we have a mad spiral into absolutely nothing. The film (based on the original novel by Robert Cormier) shows an appalling lack of understanding of New York law (the story vacillates between Buffalo and Albany)--and it shows a general lack of ability to tell a story. This adaptation seems to want to outdo the silly novel, and between the leaden performances, trite camera work and a seemingly half-dead Russell Crowe, the film does the job. The icing on the tombstone is the sophomoric, whiny college-campus soundtrack.It's a genuine shame this couldn't be more thrilling, more compassionate, more incisive and more relevant...almost anything could have improved this stink-bomb. Honestly, I cannot recall the last B-movie I saw with so much wasted potential/star power.In fact I found myself drifting away, thinking about how badly Laura Dern has aged and how Russell Crowe looks as good as he did 15 years ago. Such drifting is never a good thing while viewing a film. It's funny...I even managed to make a reasonable guess how long Russell Crowe shot for this film. I guessed about two weeks tops. Turns out he shot all his scenes in about a week and a half.That means Laura Dern must have made it through her bit in an afternoon.Most revolting of all--to me, anyway--was the loss of what might have been a cool new detective in town. While Crowe is never a bad actor, he can sure auto-pilot his way across the screen. Did the producers deliberately make his vital role into this lousy less-than-cameo? Well......INSANE ALLEGORY: It occurred to me, one way this film might be useful is if we allegorize the film, comparing the psychotic serial killer to a nuclear device, or even comparing him to a terrorist...subjects so close to our thoughts, yet so difficult to explore. Think of it: this is about a highly dangerous material (psycho-boy), released into the world in an aimless, unsupervised fashion (he isn't on parole, has no officer to shadow him). He was made at home, slowly, with materials which in themselves must be better controlled, but aren't.Then it kills its makers.Now: there is a retired detective with a home life in shambles who insists on following this material (U.N. maybe), while this material passes straight into the hands of a fairly young suicidal lunatic (Pakistan, North Korea, Iran)--and this lunatic doesn't even know what to do in the face of ordinary life, yet plays with universal fire. Armageddon as it were.See how cool it would be to think of the psycho as nuclear bomb material? See how much more LAME it makes the film?Buy something else, don't waste a minute or a penny on this, I beg you!",1,"This Deserves to Sink and Float Away, Unless it is About a Nuclear Bomb",1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,4483,"['find', 'more', 'more', 'squeamish', 'days', 'good', 'detective', 'thriller', 'now', 'then', 'beneficial', 'TENDERNESS', 'not', 'one', 'consider', 'B-movie', 'best', 'though', 'today', 'know', 'such', 'films', 'ironically', 'psychotic', 'term', 'indie', '.Russell', 'Crowe', 'fallen', 'so', 'far', 'work', 'did', 'THE', 'INSIDER', 'A', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'MIND', 'retired', 'Lieutenant', 'Cristofuoro', 'silent', 'reflective', 'cop', 'who', 'dying', 'wife', 'obsessing', 'newly', 'released', ""offender'.The"", 'offender', 'Eric', 'played', 'Jon', 'Foster', 'sexually', 'crazed', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'most', 'idiotic', 'unrealistic', 'turn', 'events', 'held', 'juvie', '18th', 'birthday', 'get', 'cold-blooded', 'double', 'murder', 'parents', '18th', 'birthday', 'warnings', 'lieutenant', 'Eric-the-Sicko', 'released', 'strings', 'attached', 'incidentally', 'murdered', 'mother', 'knew', 'other', 'murders', 'Then', 'murdered', 'father', 'father', 'walked', 'just', 'time.This', 'serial', 'killer', 'released', 'custody', 'Aunt', 'Teresa', 'pointless', 'cameo', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'yet', 'living', 'plans', 'are', 'find', 'college', 'miracle', 'miracles', 'even', 'media', 'totally', 'left', 'out', 'pathetic', 'excuse', 'story', 'Apparently', 'even', 'pretend-land', 'film', 'one', 'was', 'interested.So', 'much', 'sane', 'realism', 'story.Criss-crossed', 'weird', 'frankly', 'pathetic', 'flashback', 'work', 'are', 'introduced', 'even', 'sicker', 'individual', '15-year-old', 'Lori', 'Sophie', 'Traub', 'potential', 'star-crossed', 'lover', 'Eric', 'only', 'inwardly', 'turned', 'psychopath', 'will', 'love', 'enough', 'kill', 'even', 'loving', 'scrapbook', 'following', 'details', 'Eric-the-Psycho', 'immediately', 'sets', 'stalk', 'moment', 'free.From', 'here', 'have', 'mad', 'spiral', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'film', 'based', 'original', 'novel', 'Robert', 'Cormier', 'appalling', 'lack', 'understanding', 'New', 'York', 'law', 'story', 'vacillates', 'Buffalo', 'Albany', 'general', 'lack', 'ability', 'tell', 'story', 'adaptation', 'want', 'outdo', 'silly', 'novel', 'leaden', 'performances', 'trite', 'camera', 'work', 'seemingly', 'half-dead', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'film', 'job', 'icing', 'tombstone', 'sophomoric', 'whiny', 'college-campus', 'soundtrack.It', 'genuine', 'shame', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'thrilling', 'more', 'compassionate', 'more', 'incisive', 'more', 'relevant', 'almost', 'anything', 'could', 'have', 'improved', 'stink-bomb', 'Honestly', 'can', 'not', 'recall', 'last', 'B-movie', 'saw', 'so', 'much', 'wasted', 'potential/star', 'power.In', 'fact', 'found', 'drifting', 'away', 'thinking', 'how', 'badly', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'aged', 'how', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'as', 'good', 'did', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'Such', 'drifting', 'never', 'good', 'thing', 'viewing', 'film', 'funny', 'even', 'managed', 'make', 'reasonable', 'guess', 'how', 'long', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'shot', 'film', 'guessed', 'about', 'two', 'weeks', 'tops', 'out', 'scenes', 'week', 'half.That', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'must', 'have', 'made', 'bit', 'afternoon.Most', 'revolting', 'anyway', 'was', 'loss', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'new', 'detective', 'town', 'Crowe', 'never', 'bad', 'actor', 'can', 'sure', 'auto-pilot', 'way', 'screen', 'Did', 'producers', 'deliberately', 'make', 'vital', 'role', 'lousy', 'less-than-cameo', 'Well', 'INSANE', 'ALLEGORY', 'occurred', 'one', 'way', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'useful', 'allegorize', 'film', 'comparing', 'psychotic', 'serial', 'killer', 'nuclear', 'device', 'even', 'comparing', 'terrorist', 'so', 'close', 'thoughts', 'yet', 'so', 'difficult', 'explore', 'Think', 'highly', 'dangerous', 'material', 'psycho-boy', 'released', 'world', 'aimless', 'unsupervised', 'fashion', ""n't"", 'parole', 'officer', 'shadow', 'was', 'made', 'home', 'slowly', 'materials', 'must', 'be', 'better', 'controlled', 'makers.Now', 'retired', 'detective', 'home', 'life', 'shambles', 'who', 'following', 'material', 'U.N.', 'maybe', 'material', 'passes', 'straight', 'hands', 'fairly', 'young', 'suicidal', 'lunatic', 'Pakistan', 'North', 'Korea', 'Iran', 'lunatic', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'face', 'ordinary', 'life', 'plays', 'universal', 'fire', 'how', 'cool', 'would', 'be', 'think', 'psycho', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'material', 'See', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'LAME', 'film', 'Buy', 'something', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'minute', 'penny', 'beg']",Tenderness

Lori forces herself into Eric's life and the two head up to Buffalo where Eric is to hook up with a girl he fleetingly saw in prison.One of the cool things about this movie is that it isn't a Russell Crowe movie but a movie with Russell Crowe in it. He gets to do his thing without being the alpha male. Then there are the two leads. Jon Foster as Eric, and Sophie Traub as Lori both turn in great performances. The roles they get to play are great themselves. Nearly everything that came out of their mouths was pleasantly unexpected. He seems perfectly normal but certain things trigger a reaction in him that he cannot control. She seems pleasant enough but figures she'll always be runner up. It's as though she feels she doesn't deserve to be happy. The two play off each other well. Crowe has a quiet confidence. He tends to his wife with loving care but doesn't take his eye off the ball where Eric is concerned. Laura Dern plays Eric's aunt. She's good as usual but her part is woefully small.I'm surprised at the lukewarm reviews for this movie. It's difficult to explain just how good this really is. It's a great idea played in a very unexpected manner. I'm thinking more 4 and a half stars than the four I gave it, but maybe it isn't for everyone.

This little film slipped by everyone despite a strong cast - likely because the subject matter is rather difficult to swallow, especially as related by the time flips the picture takes in explaining the story.Buffalo detective Lt. Cristofuoro (Russell Crowe), whose catatonic wife is in hospital, takes a special interest in Eric Komenko (an excellent Jon Foster!), a juvenile who killed his parents and will be freed on his 18th birthday. So has Lori Cranston (Sophie Traub), 15 or 16, her body fully developed and the object of lust by her boss and her mother's new boyfriend. She keeps a scrapbook about Eric, and when he's released from custody, she hides in the backseat of his car, insisting he take her with him on a trip toward Albany where he's planning to meet a girl. Cristofuoro is certain Eric will kill again, visits Eric's dead mother's sister Aunt Teresa (Laura Dern, excellent) with whom he lives since his release from Juvenile Hall, agrees with Cristofuoro's intuition and encourages him to pursue Eric in Albany. What happens on the trip to Albany - the disintegration of Eric's fragile sociopathic psyche and Lori's obsession with Eric's none too subtle need to kill leads to a surprising end. It is a film that deals with compulsions on every level and in every character - especially a self-destructive teen obsessed with a murderer, a young man obsessed with killing girls, and a weary detective obsessed with keeping the young man behind bars.Jon Foster is the center of attention in the story and is supported the excellent work of Russell Crowe and Laura Dern. The supporting cast is strong. Serial killers continue to make an impact on writers, but this story takes a deeper look into the psyche of the main character, if not by words then more by body language.

1326428,A356RFKNIG043B,B0035JHYGQ,K. Swanson,"[0, 0]","2.6 starsAs one of the world's most popular screen actors, Crowe must see a million scripts. Why would he pick this one?Perhaps it was Cormier's book, which I haven't read, though coming from the author of I Am The Cheese one imagines it was pretty good. In any case, the movie version of Cormier's novel is strangely weak despite being technically decent. But the whole time I was left thinking, why is Russell Crowe in this tv movie?It's all a little too overdone, most of all in the absolutely amateurish use of music. Boy oh boy, I hate it when a movie tells me how to feel by suddenly cranking up the scary music. Be scared! Despite nothing on screen indicating that emotion, this music says you should feel it, so go ahead, feel it before you see it. Makes a lot of sense, no? No.Apart from the hideously obvious music, the acting is fair enough (Crowe is good as always but has little to work with, and his character is quite unprepossessing, all told), and the script is passable. But the whole thing feels like a weird jumble, it's hard to care for any of these characters, there's little suspense despite the constant attempts to manufacture it, and the only thing I really liked was the somewhat twisty ending. So now it makes more sense! But who cares by that point? I got well bored about 40 minutes in and just played my unplugged Strat along with the increasingly hilarious over the top score, always a sign that I've chosen poorly from the local rental barn.It's all competent enough (excepting the music), but I can't think of any real reasons to recommend this film to anyone but perhaps a young girl obsessed with a psychopath. I'm not sure that audience is reading these reviews, so suffice to say, avoid this Tenderness and instead try a little of Otis Redding's version.

1326434,A387BD735MI50R,B0035JHYGQ,R. Schultz,"[9, 10]","This movie is set in motion by the release of a young serial killer from prison. His unabated blood lust, obvious to retired police detective Russell Crowe, drives the early scenes. The compulsive nature of his desire to kill makes for some suspect psychology. I'm not sure that's quite the mindset operating in teenage killers. But if you can suspend disbelief for a while, his predatory appraisal of his surroundings fills this film with the muscular tension of an animal about to spring on you.The scene showing one of his last days in prison is especially effective. A juvenile from the girl's compound mistakenly wanders into the cafeteria where he's cleaning up, and is caught like a deer in the intense, high-beam gaze of the hungry hunter in him. This silent confrontation of predator and prey is brilliant acting.When another young girl, a sort of convicted killer groupie, attaches herself to the newly independent boy, the film looks a little as if it's going to be another ""Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer"" odyssey. We think the question will be if, or how long, this young innocent with misplaced enthusiasms will survive in the company of such a dangerous character.However the film ultimately doesn't center on the serial killer himself or on the hazard posed by his impulses. It takes a creative turn and focuses on the groupie, whose attachment turns out to spring from more profound motives than we originally suspected.There is something about her that we can perhaps all identify with. Beneath her casual bubbliness, she is in despair over the always-ness of her life. Her mother always brings home men focused more on her nubile form than on having any sincere relationship with the more mature woman. The world always disappoints her. Such repetitions bring her to her own dangerous brink.This is a thoughtful movie, with something else to offer - with something more to offer than the rampages of yet another homicidal maniac.",4,Not Just Another Homicidal Maniac,1295913600,"01 25, 2011",2011,1952,"['movie', 'set', 'motion', 'release', 'young', 'serial', 'killer', 'prison', 'unabated', 'blood', 'lust', 'obvious', 'retired', 'police', 'detective', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'early', 'scenes', 'compulsive', 'nature', 'desire', 'kill', 'suspect', 'psychology', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'quite', 'mindset', 'operating', 'teenage', 'killers', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'while', 'predatory', 'appraisal', 'surroundings', 'film', 'muscular', 'tension', 'animal', 'spring', 'you.The', 'scene', 'showing', 'one', 'last', 'days', 'prison', 'especially', 'effective', 'juvenile', 'girl', 'compound', 'mistakenly', 'cafeteria', 'where', 'cleaning', 'up', 'caught', 'deer', 'intense', 'high-beam', 'gaze', 'hungry', 'hunter', 'silent', 'confrontation', 'predator', 'prey', 'brilliant', 'young', 'girl', 'sort', 'convicted', 'killer', 'groupie', 'newly', 'independent', 'boy', 'film', 'little', 'going', 'be', 'Henry', 'Portrait', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'odyssey', 'think', 'question', 'will', 'be', 'how', 'long', 'young', 'innocent', 'misplaced', 'enthusiasms', 'will', 'survive', 'company', 'such', 'dangerous', 'character.However', 'film', 'ultimately', ""n't"", 'center', 'serial', 'killer', 'hazard', 'posed', 'impulses', 'creative', 'turn', 'groupie', 'attachment', 'out', 'spring', 'more', 'profound', 'motives', 'originally', 'something', 'can', 'perhaps', 'identify', 'Beneath', 'casual', 'bubbliness', 'despair', 'always-ness', 'life', 'mother', 'always', 'home', 'men', 'focused', 'more', 'nubile', 'form', 'having', 'sincere', 'relationship', 'more', 'mature', 'woman', 'world', 'always', 'Such', 'repetitions', 'bring', 'own', 'dangerous', 'brink.This', 'thoughtful', 'movie', 'something', 'else', 'offer', 'something', 'more', 'offer', 'rampages', 'yet', 'homicidal', 'maniac']",Tenderness

If you want a movie which makes sense, this is not the one for you. Basically, Eric is a serial killer who is let out of prison (WHAT?) and is then harassed by a cop halfheartedly played by an obviously jaded Russell Crowe. A pretty girl stows away in his car (???) even though she knows he is a killer (!) and they sort of meander around together. Crowe's character stalks them but can do nothing, despite the fact the girl is underaged (WHAT?) We expect Eric to kill her, but she kills herself instead (WHAT?) and Eric, who turns out to be a serial killer with a heart of gold (!) tries to save her. He is all torn up over her death, and somehow (we do not see how) ends up in jail for being associated with her demise. Crowe's character knows Eric is innocent (???) but uses this as an excuse to put him back in the can anyway. The movie finally ends without much of anything having happened and you wonder why you watched it.No, I did not give it away. To do that there would have to be a story.

I can only imagine the pre-production ideas that must have surrounded this turkey. Crowe plays a kind of (?) retired cop who has a comatose wife that plays absolutely no part in the movie, but is tossed in there anyway to show...  What? Why? There is also a queer notion that the murdering youth's church is solidly behind him, and he continually prays before eating, yet this point is also never developed. When the kid yells ""you have no right to detain me!"" to Crowe, we have to agree with him but this part of the movie (why someone not on the force has these arbitrary powers...?) is never explored either.When the girl and the guy are driving down the freeway, and the next shot is they are in a totally removed abandoned trailer because the girl ""has to use the bathroom,"" we have to wonder if the production people need more or less drugs to remind them of something called 'continuity.' To make matters worse, Crowe shows up two minutes behind them, when he wasnt even tailing them! Altho he's only twenty yards from two cars, Russell's character cannot hear them drive away either. It's these kinds of sophomoric and egotistical director's choices that make this movie a total clunker.Altho we are led to believe the main character's killing of a young girl years before was discovered by his mother and that's why he killed both his parents, this thread is left dangling to an audience that quickly thinks ""who cares?"" The female star is so vapid and annoying that one is hoping the killer will soon dispose of her, but he is also so uninteresting and confused that we wonder where this film is going rather quickly.The main girl looking to get murdered by this tentative, newly released killer of his parents is also poorly drawn, with some examples of decadence, but for her kinda (?) rape we rely on hearsay.The production never really decides what it is about. If it's supposed to be a girl looking to be a ""prey"" then it's rather poorly written from that point as well.The fact that the killer doesn't want her to die at the end is also rather non-sequiter as he was ready to kill her earlier. There is simply no ""juice"" in the film that makes you care whether the killer wanted to murder her or not; or deserves to go back to jail for doing so.",1,Surprisiingly poor,1271203200,"04 14, 2010",2010,2356,"['always', 'shock', 'when', 'top-flight', 'actors', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'get', 'caught', 'messes', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'pre-production', 'ideas', 'must', 'have', 'surrounded', 'turkey', 'Crowe', 'kind', 'retired', 'cop', 'who', 'comatose', 'wife', 'absolutely', 'part', 'movie', 'tossed', 'anyway', 'show', 'What', 'Why', 'also', 'queer', 'notion', 'murdering', 'youth', 'church', 'solidly', 'continually', 'eating', 'yet', 'point', 'also', 'never', 'developed', 'When', 'kid', 'have', 'right', 'detain', 'Crowe', 'have', 'agree', 'part', 'movie', 'why', 'someone', 'not', 'force', 'arbitrary', 'powers', 'never', 'explored', 'girl', 'guy', 'are', 'driving', 'down', 'freeway', 'next', 'shot', 'are', 'totally', 'removed', 'abandoned', 'trailer', 'girl', 'use', 'bathroom', 'have', 'wonder', 'production', 'people', 'need', 'more', 'less', 'drugs', 'remind', 'something', 'called', ""'continuity"", 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Crowe', 'up', 'two', 'minutes', 'when', 'wasnt', 'even', 'tailing', 'Altho', 'only', 'twenty', 'yards', 'two', 'cars', 'Russell', 'character', 'can', 'not', 'hear', 'drive', 'away', 'kinds', 'sophomoric', 'egotistical', 'director', 'choices', 'make', 'movie', 'total', 'clunker.Altho', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'main', 'character', 'killing', 'young', 'girl', 'years', 'was', 'discovered', 'mother', 'why', 'killed', 'parents', 'thread', 'left', 'dangling', 'audience', 'quickly', 'who', 'female', 'star', 'so', 'vapid', 'annoying', 'one', 'hoping', 'killer', 'will', 'soon', 'dispose', 'also', 'so', 'uninteresting', 'confused', 'wonder', 'where', 'film', 'going', 'rather', 'quickly.The', 'main', 'girl', 'looking', 'get', 'murdered', 'tentative', 'newly', 'released', 'killer', 'parents', 'also', 'poorly', 'drawn', 'examples', 'decadence', 'kinda', 'rape', 'rely', 'hearsay.The', 'production', 'never', 'really', 'what', 'about', 'supposed', 'be', 'girl', 'looking', 'be', 'prey', 'then', 'rather', 'poorly', 'written', 'point', 'well.The', 'fact', 'killer', ""n't"", 'want', 'die', 'end', 'also', 'rather', 'non-sequiter', 'was', 'ready', 'kill', 'earlier', 'simply', 'juice', 'film', 'care', 'killer', 'wanted', 'murder', 'not', 'go', 'back', 'jail', 'doing', 'so']",Tenderness
