1396508,A1NH0XLYIYMGO4,B004CZRE5I,"Derek Hagen ""Gospel Moody""","[9, 10]","(Mr J. Lovin's review is for another movie altogether).This is a true western in widescreen color with a darn good remastering job. Better than some I've seen lately. They knew how to make westerns in the '50's and this is a classic example. Two guys formerly of Quantrell's Raiders are secretly released from Texas incarceration to join up with the remnants of the Raiders in Arizona to help capture them. Audie Murphy, who does a good job here, is conflicted as to whether he should join the newly formed Arizona Rangers headed by Buster Crabbe, or head for Mexico.With lots of action and riding through great western scenery, this movie almost feels like an epic story. You might think this is all about raiders, rangers and cavalry - groups of men fighting each other, and there is that, but really, it is about 2 guys trying to find their way after the Civil War. It's what makes it a good solid western. I've seen this before in 4x3 blurry vhs quality. It is far more impressive this way. It's like watching a totally different movie.",5,1950's Western classic in remastered widescreen color,1302134400,"04 7, 2011",2011,1040,"['Mr', 'J.', 'Lovin', 'review', 'movie', 'altogether', '.This', 'true', 'western', 'widescreen', 'color', 'darn', 'good', 'remastering', 'job', 'Better', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lately', 'knew', 'how', 'make', 'westerns', ""'50"", 'classic', 'example', 'Two', 'guys', 'formerly', 'Quantrell', 'Raiders', 'are', 'secretly', 'released', 'Texas', 'incarceration', 'join', 'up', 'remnants', 'Raiders', 'Arizona', 'help', 'capture', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'who', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'conflicted', 'should', 'join', 'newly', 'formed', 'Arizona', 'Rangers', 'headed', 'Buster', 'Crabbe', 'head', 'Mexico.With', 'lots', 'action', 'riding', 'great', 'western', 'scenery', 'movie', 'almost', 'feels', 'epic', 'story', 'might', 'think', 'raiders', 'rangers', 'cavalry', 'groups', 'men', 'fighting', 'other', 'really', '2', 'guys', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'Civil', 'War', 'what', 'good', 'solid', 'western', ""'ve"", 'seen', '4x3', 'blurry', 'vhs', 'quality', 'far', 'more', 'impressive', 'way', 'watching', 'totally', 'different', 'movie']",N/A
