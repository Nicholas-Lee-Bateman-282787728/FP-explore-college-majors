He isn't yet 1 1/2 but he can sign the following words: please, more, milk, thank you, dog, cat, Mom, Dad, drink, bear, car, and probably some I just can't remember now. There are many many more which he hasn't mastered  yet or just doesn't use (such as zoo animals).  He will sit and watch it and then want to watch it over again and again.

She laughs and claps whenever I put it on.We started showing her the series at about 7 months but she didn't get interested until about 13 months.  I was shocked at how quickly she began making signs at that point.Her verbal skills are expanding rapidly at this point but her pronunciation is still horrible - like most toddlers, only mommy and daddy can understand what she says.  Signing lets her get her point across much more easily so she feels far less frustrated.This third volume has the basic color signs in it and has been very helpful in teaching my daughter the concept of colors as well as the verbal words and signs.",5,Great series,1203120000,"02 16, 2008",2008,679,"['daughter', '18', 'months', 'now', 'series', 'whenever', 'put', 'on.We', 'started', 'showing', 'series', '7', 'months', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'interested', '13', 'months', 'was', 'shocked', 'how', 'quickly', 'began', 'making', 'signs', 'point.Her', 'verbal', 'skills', 'are', 'expanding', 'rapidly', 'point', 'pronunciation', 'still', 'horrible', 'most', 'toddlers', 'only', 'mommy', 'daddy', 'can', 'understand', 'what', 'Signing', 'get', 'point', 'much', 'more', 'easily', 'far', 'less', 'frustrated.This', 'third', 'volume', 'basic', 'color', 'signs', 'been', 'very', 'helpful', 'teaching', 'daughter', 'concept', 'colors', 'as', 'well', 'verbal', 'words', 'signs']",My Baby Can Talk - Exploring Signs

1107182,A2ZLT091VTCSAS,B000W4U8FG,"Tessa L. Burman ""orion""","[3, 3]","I am writing to tell you how much my daughter, Campbell, loves your third DVD in the My Baby Can Talk series. We have been watching the movie almost daily because she loves the DVD and she likes to sign the word ""slide"" and watch the toy animals work themselves up the ladder and down the slide.  She signs ""slide"" and says the word. She is working hard at trying to learn all the signs and doing a great job of trying to master the signs. Some with her own little twist!  She is really enjoying the movie and I can't be happier!I can't tell you how wonderful it is to see her so excited when she remembers a sign or uses a sign while reading a book or going for a walk to let me know what she is seeing and what she would like to do. Campbell is going to turn two years old soon and it's been wonderful teaching her sign language. It has made communications with her so much easier and stronger. Since she is using more language skills and trying to talk; when she is trying to find the words to express herself, I remind her to use her signs and then she isn't so frustrated!! And neither are we!! She is also a budding little artist, so the learning the color signs, such as red, yellow or blue,  has been a wonderful addition into our art time together! Thank you so much for creating such an educational and wonderful product. I keep recommending your DVDs and website to people where ever we go , and I highly recommend its use to new moms and dads(and so do Campbell's Grandparents!). Thank you again and I look forward to more wonderful products from you in the future!Campbell's Mom Tessa - San Jose, CA",5,Another wonderful teaching tool!,1192579200,"10 17, 2007",2007,1612,"['am', 'writing', 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'daughter', 'Campbell', 'third', 'DVD', 'My', 'Baby', 'Can', 'Talk', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'movie', 'almost', 'daily', 'DVD', 'sign', 'word', 'slide', 'watch', 'toy', 'animals', 'work', 'up', 'ladder', 'slide', 'signs', 'slide', 'word', 'working', 'hard', 'trying', 'learn', 'signs', 'doing', 'great', 'job', 'trying', 'master', 'signs', 'own', 'little', 'twist', 'really', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'happier', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'wonderful', 'see', 'so', 'excited', 'when', 'sign', 'sign', 'reading', 'book', 'going', 'walk', 'let', 'know', 'what', 'seeing', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'do', 'Campbell', 'going', 'turn', 'two', 'years', 'old', 'soon', 'been', 'wonderful', 'teaching', 'sign', 'language', 'made', 'communications', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'stronger', 'using', 'more', 'language', 'skills', 'trying', 'talk', 'when', 'trying', 'find', 'words', 'express', 'remind', 'use', 'signs', 'then', ""n't"", 'so', 'frustrated', 'are', 'also', 'budding', 'little', 'artist', 'learning', 'color', 'signs', 'such', 'red', 'yellow', 'blue', 'been', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'art', 'time', 'together', 'Thank', 'so', 'much', 'creating', 'educational', 'wonderful', 'product', 'keep', 'recommending', 'DVDs', 'website', 'people', 'where', 'ever', 'go', 'highly', 'recommend', 'use', 'new', 'moms', 'dads', 'so', 'do', 'Campbell', 'Grandparents', 'Thank', 'again', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'wonderful', 'products', 'future', 'Campbell', 'Mom', 'Tessa', 'San', 'Jose', 'CA']",My Baby Can Talk - Exploring Signs
