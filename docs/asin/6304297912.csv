As an author/reading junkie/movie buff, sometimes I start to believe it. Then a film like this comes along and kicks me squarely on my ample backside. Humor that's dark, witty, wicked, gritty, accurate. Based on a novel by someone with a true appreciation of, and a gift for, the language. No hesitation to smack you hard with the grim reality of heroin addiction.You're groaning. I can tell. You're thinking this is such a stale subject that it only proves my opening premise.

This film makes you feel frustrated, pent-up and desperate to to change your life radically, as if  in the depths of a vicious, destructive cycle. This feeling is hard to  shake even when you realize that you're not, in fact, hopelessly addicted  to heroin with the only bright spot in your life a young Lolita who you  keep seeing simply because if you break it off, she'll turn you in to the  cops. In a plot I kept expecting to become maudlin or 'Hollywood,' the film  is without identifiable holes, right down to the ending, which is not what  you would expect, except if you realize that the only possible choice is to  do what is not expected. Ewan McGregor is excellent in his breakthrough  role and Robert Carlyle is very strong, if miles away from his role as  'Gaz,' the lead in &quot;The Full Monty.&quot; The DVD version is a clean,  sharp transfer, although there are no special features.

The movie was largely true to the book however there were a number of events that took place in the book that the movie didn't show.  Reading the book clarifies a few of the things that happen in the film - for example there is a scene in the movie where Spud does some amphetamine before going to a job interview.  I was unsure of his motivation (other than getting high) in the movie but in the book it was clear that he did the speed so that it would look like he was eager for the job, but wouldn't get it - so he could continue to receive his unemployment compensation from the government.I recommended this movie highly to my parents and they didn't like it.

This film is not a popcorn movie; it's a movie that requires patience and whether you like it or not, it will provoke you different emotions and thoughts.""Trainspotting"" tells the story of Renton and his buddies Spud, Sick Boy and Tommy; all these guys are junkies and they are stuck in a constant debate between choose a ""normal life"" (what is normal, anyway?) and the life style of a drug addict. So as the story unfolds, we see how they promise to quit drugs and almost immediately fall again in the addiction. Also, they hang around with the local psychotic drunk Begbie; he is not a junkie, but he loves to drink and to provoke fights with the slightest opportunity.The movie shows some of the main consequences that the drug abuse brings: how you lose the perspective of the things that happen around you, how you affect your family and your closest friends, how you become a drug slave, how your body deteriorates, how you can become a threat to all the people, and how pathetic you can be once you become a junkie.And yet, in ""Trainspotting"" we see that everybody has always choices: ""Choose life or choose not to choose life"".

It is, however, a great film.At no time does ""Trainspotting"" glamourise the drug culture.  By the same token, at no time does it become preachy or self-righteous.  It is simply a grim look at the whole industry.The film is bleak and dark but, from time to time, it is also funny.  Ewan McGregor as the narrator and chief character is brilliant.  So too is Robert Carlyle as the psychotic thug whose reversion to violence can be abrupt and frightening.  These two and an assorted cast of misfits create a true film masterpiece.A plot, to the extent that it exists, concerns the ups and downs of a gang of Glaswegian no hopers.  Heroin is the only glue that holds them together.  It is also the substance that is ineluctably destroying them.  There are many downs and few high points.  Heroin is a savage mistress.

413756,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304297912,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","There are truly a lot of films about drug abuse, but there are a select few that shed light on the brutality of it.  I've reviewed films such as `Requiem for a Dream' and `Panic at Needle Park', two films that show the drastic measures some will go in destroying themselves for a fix; and it's within those films that the haunting realities of drug addiction becomes so real to the audience.  `Trainspotting' is similar in its honesty, yet it differs in its direction.  Some have been put off from the way that `Trainspotting' portrays drug abuse, but in my personal opinion the slight comedic edge the film possesses adds yet another layer of honesty to the film.Boyle's masterpiece shows the light and the dark side of addiction.The film centers around a group of friends who area all heavy into heroin.  They all at times strive for a better existence but are more often than not taken over by their carnal desires.  The film simply observes their conduct and exposes the reasons they stay hooked as well as the reasons they wish they weren't.What is so devastating about `Trainspotting' is that it nearly blindsides you with its shocking moments of truth.  This technique works very well, for it generates in us pure and genuine outbursts of emotion.  Some have mentioned a certain scene involving an infant; a scene so raw and heart-stopping that I was literally in tears.  These are the moments that benefit from the films wicked mixture of drama and humor, for it makes the impact of these scenes even more devastating.  We are friends with these people (even though we really shouldn't be) and so to watch them crumble under the weight of their disease is heartbreaking.The film is propelled by a commanding performance by Ewan McGregor.  He captures every ounce of Renton's immaturity as well as his worldly knowledge and strive for betterment.  He is engaging, entertaining, likable and relatable.  He's aided by a very strong cast that includes Robert Carlyle and it is here that we are introduced to the luminous Kelly Macdonald (of `No Country for Old Men' fame).  Macdonald is one of my favorites here, for her slick mix of sensuality and impish dominance is pure gold.  I just loved watching her.Danny Boyle's magical talents are on full display here.  I know he is a household name now thanks to his Oscar winning film `Slumdog Millionaire', but honestly he is in top form in his earlier work (see also his ravenous work on '28 Days Later').  I've always been a fan of his, and this is probably his best work.  Visually he is captivating, but he juggles both the witty and the ominous with such strength.  It's a flawless culmination of the two.This film is as shocking as it is engrossing; as repulsive as it is engaging.  There are few films that are daring enough to be this honest.",5,A well balanced mixture of pleasure and pain helps create an honest depiction of depravity...,1236729600,"03 11, 2009",2009,2801,"['are', 'truly', 'lot', 'films', 'drug', 'abuse', 'are', 'select', 'few', 'shed', 'light', 'brutality', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'films', 'such', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'Panic', 'Needle', 'Park', 'two', 'films', 'show', 'drastic', 'measures', 'will', 'go', 'destroying', 'fix', 'films', 'haunting', 'realities', 'drug', 'addiction', 'so', 'real', 'audience', 'Trainspotting', 'similar', 'honesty', 'direction', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'off', 'way', 'Trainspotting', 'portrays', 'drug', 'abuse', 'personal', 'opinion', 'slight', 'comedic', 'edge', 'film', 'yet', 'layer', 'honesty', 'film.Boyle', 'masterpiece', 'light', 'dark', 'side', 'addiction.The', 'film', 'centers', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'area', 'heavy', 'heroin', 'times', 'strive', 'better', 'existence', 'are', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'taken', 'over', 'carnal', 'desires', 'film', 'simply', 'conduct', 'reasons', 'stay', 'hooked', 'as', 'well', 'reasons', 'wish', ""weren't.What"", 'so', 'devastating', 'Trainspotting', 'nearly', 'shocking', 'moments', 'truth', 'technique', 'very', 'well', 'pure', 'genuine', 'outbursts', 'emotion', 'have', 'mentioned', 'certain', 'scene', 'involving', 'infant', 'scene', 'raw', 'heart-stopping', 'was', 'literally', 'tears', 'are', 'moments', 'benefit', 'films', 'wicked', 'mixture', 'drama', 'humor', 'impact', 'scenes', 'even', 'more', 'devastating', 'are', 'friends', 'people', 'even', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'watch', 'crumble', 'weight', 'disease', 'heartbreaking.The', 'film', 'propelled', 'commanding', 'performance', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'ounce', 'Renton', 'immaturity', 'as', 'well', 'worldly', 'knowledge', 'strive', 'betterment', 'engaging', 'entertaining', 'likable', 'relatable', 'aided', 'very', 'strong', 'cast', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'here', 'are', 'introduced', 'luminous', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'fame', 'Macdonald', 'one', 'favorites', 'here', 'slick', 'mix', 'sensuality', 'impish', 'dominance', 'pure', 'gold', 'just', 'loved', 'watching', 'her.Danny', 'Boyle', 'magical', 'talents', 'are', 'full', 'display', 'here', 'know', 'household', 'name', 'now', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'film', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'honestly', 'top', 'form', 'earlier', 'work', 'see', 'also', 'ravenous', 'work', ""'28"", 'Days', 'Later', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'probably', 'best', 'work', 'Visually', 'captivating', 'witty', 'ominous', 'such', 'strength', 'flawless', 'culmination', 'two.This', 'film', 'as', 'shocking', 'engrossing', 'as', 'repulsive', 'engaging', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'are', 'daring', 'enough', 'be', 'honest']",Trainspotting VHS

The film neither  glorifies drugs nor drug addicts but does illustrate in a graphic manner  the allure of drugs in today's society.  Four working class guys with  average educations, middle class backgrounds, and futures that don't seem  to hold much promise are drawn to the heroin-chic society of 80s Scotland.  The four, Renton, Sickboy, Spud, and Tommy become victims as the failure of  parents, social service agencies, the medical profession, and law  enforcement to intervene has little effect and success.  That the story is  set in Great Britain is irrelevant because the story is an American one as  well, and the problem defies national boundaries.  What is unique is the  humor and irrevent cheek of the four boys whose lives descend rapidly while  their habits become deadly.Some video versions of the film have minor  variations but predominantly differ in the scenes of  sex between Renton  and Diane with fleeting glimpses of ecstacy rather than full frontal nudity  cut from the American theatrical release.  In addition,  the dubbing of  Ewan McGregor's opening monologue tones down his thick brogue for sensitive  American ears that fail to understand the Queen's English.  VCR or DVD  editions also feature interviews with the team of Boyle and MacDonald and  scenes deleted from the final cut, but whichever edition you have, its the  same story with only miniscule changes.  The soundtrack is a marvelous  compilation of music to shoot up by various artists and now is heard on  main stream television spots for automobiles in the US.  Brilliant  character acting by Robert Carlyle as Begbie and McGregor as Renton  introduced them to mainstream American audiences.  The film is rated R  however no one dies from guns or violence inflicted by others.  The  clinical scenes of addicts shooting junk into their veins disgust and  disturb for good reason.

413768,A1ZXFB39UJQUIN,6304297912,Chris,"[5, 7]","Easily one of the best films of the 1990s, &quot;Trainspotting&quot; centers around a group of youngsters who are controlled by their addiction to heroin. Set in Scotland, where the youth in question live on welfare money to support their habits, the main character Renton (played brilliantly by Ewen McGregor) decides to give kicking the habit another shot, and in the process of trying to sober himself he watches his life, and the lives of his friends, fall apart all around him.There is an inescapable feeling of a loss of hope that emenates from just about every character in the movie. Such external factors as economy, lack of direction, lack of self-control, and fear of almost all things, including cheating thir bodies' craving and having to go through withdrawal, are all telling factors in how they each respond to the different obstacles they face throughout the movie.The movie is definitely not without its funny points, and the dry humor that is seemingly rapid-fired by the characters as they engage in their normal activities of mischief hold substantially more comic value than is seen in most comedies these days.The feeling of closure in the movie is very ambiguous for me. On one hand, you can definitely see a chapter of someone's life come to an end in a disheartening but nonetheless necessary fashion. On the other, the path ahead for the individual has a very &quot;Lady or the Tiger&quot; feel to it, although I'm sure the writers would have us believe that things end in a very good way.

Instead they decided to take on the difficult project of filming the unfilmable, namely Irving Welsh's extreme, druggy vision, Trainspotting. The Edinburgh writer's cult novel is a shocking, sickening, but also blackly hilarious voyage into his city's dark nether regions, an dso is this film.The movie follows the fortunes of likable, suede-head junkie Mark Renton (McGregor), and his dodgy gang of sidekicks: girl magnet Sick Boy, nerd Spud, and psycho Begsbie (Robert Carlyle). Exploring the oblivion and depredation of drugs, the film treats us to delights of acute diarrhea, 'toilet diving' in the filthiest toilet in Scotland, crime, unemployment, AIDS, copious vomiting, as well as some football. One of the more direct statements made in the movie is that being Scottish sucks. What is more apparent, however, is that being a f**ked up junkie sucks.The fact that such unpromising material makes for compelling viewing is due to the sheer talent at work in the film. The center of the movie is Renton's cynical, world-weary view: &quot;One day their won't be men or women, just wankers&quot;.The soundtrack, mixing the cool of Lou Reed with techno and Britpop, is not a grubby attempt to cash in, but helps the atmosphere and the pacing of the movie.McGregor's acting is assured. His sullen, hypnotic presence is the film's heart, but he is ably assisted by the other actors, particularly Robert Carlyle's Begsbie. Irving Welsh also makes an appearance as local dealer Mother Superior so called because of the length of his habit!Certainly this is a dark and dirty, violent and sordid movie, but it is also strangely uplifting with a hint of optimism at the end. Hamstrung by its need to constantly make deals and cover all the bases, this is the kind of movie, Hollywood is no longer able to make.",5,Definitely Not Hollywood,980640000,"01 28, 2001",2001,1998,"['success', 'Shallow', 'Grave', 'triumvirate', 'director', 'Boyle', 'producer', 'Andrew', 'MacDonald', 'writer', 'John', 'Hodge', 'did', ""n't"", 'sell', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'grab', 'barrel', 'loads', 'cash', 'offer', 'Instead', 'decided', 'take', 'difficult', 'project', 'filming', 'unfilmable', 'namely', 'Irving', 'Welsh', 'extreme', 'druggy', 'vision', 'Trainspotting', 'Edinburgh', 'writer', 'cult', 'novel', 'shocking', 'sickening', 'also', 'blackly', 'hilarious', 'voyage', 'city', 'dark', 'nether', 'regions', 'dso', 'film.The', 'movie', 'fortunes', 'likable', 'suede-head', 'junkie', 'Mark', 'Renton', 'McGregor', 'dodgy', 'gang', 'sidekicks', 'girl', 'magnet', 'Sick', 'Boy', 'nerd', 'Spud', 'psycho', 'Begsbie', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'Exploring', 'oblivion', 'depredation', 'drugs', 'film', 'delights', 'acute', 'diarrhea', 'diving', 'filthiest', 'toilet', 'Scotland', 'crime', 'unemployment', 'AIDS', 'copious', 'vomiting', 'as', 'well', 'football', 'One', 'more', 'direct', 'statements', 'made', 'movie', 'being', 'Scottish', 'sucks', 'What', 'more', 'apparent', 'however', 'being', 'f**ked', 'up', 'junkie', 'sucks.The', 'fact', 'such', 'unpromising', 'material', 'compelling', 'viewing', 'due', 'sheer', 'talent', 'work', 'film', 'center', 'movie', 'Renton', 'cynical', 'world-weary', 'view', 'quot', 'One', 'day', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'men', 'women', 'just', 'wankers', 'quot', '.The', 'soundtrack', 'mixing', 'cool', 'Lou', 'Reed', 'techno', 'Britpop', 'not', 'grubby', 'attempt', 'cash', 'atmosphere', 'pacing', 'movie.McGregor', 'acting', 'assured', 'sullen', 'hypnotic', 'presence', 'film', 'heart', 'ably', 'assisted', 'other', 'actors', 'particularly', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'Begsbie', 'Irving', 'Welsh', 'also', 'appearance', 'local', 'dealer', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'so', 'called', 'length', 'habit', 'Certainly', 'dark', 'dirty', 'violent', 'sordid', 'movie', 'also', 'strangely', 'uplifting', 'hint', 'optimism', 'end', 'Hamstrung', 'need', 'constantly', 'make', 'deals', 'cover', 'bases', 'kind', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'make']",Trainspotting VHS

While the film garnered accolades, I found it to be profoundly disturbing as the seemier side of addiction was vividly depicted.  Ewan McGregor playing Mark Renton and his crew which included ""Full Monty"" star Robert Carlyle, as violent psycho Begbie, swing back and forth between kicking the habit and falling back in love with allure of a scag high.Congregating in a filthy, deplorable shooting gallery the gang is shown in graphic manner getting high.  As a group they're abhorent of authority and employment and motivated only by scoring their next fix.McGregor attempts to kick the habit by locking himself into an apartment with needed supllies.  Remembering the constipation from a previous attempt he goes out to score suppositories.  In a humorous scene, cramps force him to use the filthiest toilet in Scotland into which he drops his precious suppositories.  He then dives into the disgusting toilet to retrieve them.McGregor eventually does clean up complete with cold turkey induced horrific hallucinations, escaping to London and working as a realtor.  His buddies follow him there and reel him back into the life.McGregor and Carlyle and two other buddies eventually have their dreams come true,........the big drug deal.

413773,AZBMMIQKBFUZM,6304297912,craig a.,"[0, 0]","i loved this film since the day it arrived in limited screen release back in 1996. i had never read an Irvine Welsh novel and wasnt quite sure what to expect. The only sense of British humor (including the great emerald isles, scotland and wales)i had seen in film before trainspotting is probably a fish called wanda. of course these two films are worlds apart from one another and an entirely different brand of comedy. the parts you are supposed to laugh at have you in gutwrenching hysterics and the parts intended to be a little more gruesome you're practically having to turn your head from the tv screen.the characters are beautifully illustrated and are very true to the characters presented in Welsh's novel. Renton (played by Ewan McGregor when he was still wet behind the ears) is the narrator and main character. he is surrounded by friends who share the same ambition as him, looking for their next shot of heroin. the things they find themselves doing are inconceiveable to the sober mind.the emphasis is the world that heroin creates and most certainly stops itself from glamorizing its use. the setting is a very dismal and gloomy Edinburgh, Scotland which is ideal for the storyline.the thing most intriguing about the film is how you find each of the characters to be likeable and endearing in their own unique way. the world of &quot;junkie music&quot; is woven ingeniously into the film which clearly makes the two soundtracks an ideal accompaniment to the film. all of the performances are memorable and it created a new genre of filmmaking to come out of Great Britain. Visceral, hard edged, truthful and gritty are the words that will lean heavy on you once you've seen this film. Supposedly, Welsh is in talks currently to make a film out of the novel Ecstacy and should be out sometime next year. more scenes of pharmaceutical use and sheer pandemonium.

413774,A2BT578J4IZOK6,6304297912,"Craobh Rua ""Craobh Rua""","[6, 8]","""Trainspotting"", a classic movie that spawned a classic soundtrack, hit the big screen in 1996 and is based on Irvine Welsh's debut novel. Starring, among others, a pre-Jedi Ewan McGregor, Johnny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle, the film is mostly set in Edinburgh and London. The film is narrated by Mark Renton - known to some as Rent Boy and played by McGregor. It tells the story of our 'hero' and his friends : a group of junkies and / or criminals.As the film opens, Renton is already a heroin addict - though, as it progresses, he tries several times to get off the drug. Most of his friends are also addicts - the most notable exception is Begbie, played by Carlyle. Franco (as he is occasionally known) is an ignorant, obnoxious, violent, hard-drinking bully, who likes nothing better than being at the center of a brawl. Sick Boy - played by Miller - is as much a rival to Renton as a friend. He is also something of an expert on Sean Connery, particularly in his 007 days. (Miller's grandfather, funnily enough, played ""M"" in the Bond movies until 1979). For some reason, I found Spud (played by Ewen Bremmer) to be the most likeable character - or, at least, the one I had the most sympathy for...I'm not entirely sure why, when it was Tommy who had the worst luck of all. (Bremmer was also in the running for the part of Renton - he'd played that part on stage in Edinburgh and London). The gang's dealer is known as Mother Superior - it's not that he's particularly religious, it's more to do with the length of his habit.The soundtrack is superb - New Order feature, while Primal Scream begged to be allowed to write a song after seeing a rough cut of the movie. I now find it hard not to think of the film's opening scene when I hear Iggy Pop's ""Lust for Life"", while Lou Reed's ""Perfect Day"" inclusion is not entirely unexpected, but thoroughly welcome.Anyone who tells you that ""Trainspotting"" glamorises drug-taking in general, and heroin use in particular, simply can't have watched it. While there is a great deal of humor, many of the scenes and situations do not present addiction as an appealing option. Renton and his friends see a great deal of action : constipation when hooked, impressive bouts of diarrhoea when coming off the drug, the risk of catching HIV / AIDS, the sickness brought on by going cold turkey and the potentially fatal effects of too big a hit. As a result, it's not for the easily offended or the squeamish - while it's one of my favorite movies, I wouldn't recommend watching it with your grandparents !",5,Choose Trainspotting,1109808000,"03 3, 2005",2005,2550,"['Trainspotting', 'classic', 'movie', 'spawned', 'classic', 'soundtrack', 'hit', 'big', 'screen', '1996', 'based', 'Irvine', 'Welsh', 'debut', 'novel', 'Starring', 'others', 'pre-Jedi', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Johnny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'film', 'mostly', 'set', 'Edinburgh', 'London', 'film', 'narrated', 'Mark', 'Renton', 'known', 'Rent', 'Boy', 'played', 'McGregor', 'story', ""'hero"", 'friends', 'group', 'junkies', '/', 'criminals.As', 'film', 'Renton', 'already', 'heroin', 'addict', 'though', 'several', 'times', 'get', 'off', 'drug', 'Most', 'friends', 'are', 'also', 'most', 'notable', 'exception', 'Begbie', 'played', 'Carlyle', 'Franco', 'occasionally', 'known', 'ignorant', 'obnoxious', 'violent', 'hard-drinking', 'bully', 'who', 'nothing', 'better', 'being', 'center', 'brawl', 'Sick', 'Boy', 'played', 'Miller', 'as', 'much', 'rival', 'Renton', 'friend', 'also', 'something', 'expert', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'particularly', '007', 'days', 'Miller', 'grandfather', 'funnily', 'enough', 'played', 'M', 'Bond', 'movies', '1979', 'reason', 'found', 'Spud', 'played', 'Ewen', 'Bremmer', 'be', 'most', 'likeable', 'character', 'least', 'one', 'had', 'most', 'sympathy', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'why', 'when', 'was', 'Tommy', 'who', 'had', 'worst', 'luck', 'Bremmer', 'was', 'also', 'running', 'part', 'Renton', ""'d"", 'played', 'part', 'stage', 'Edinburgh', 'London', 'gang', 'dealer', 'known', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'not', 'particularly', 'religious', 'more', 'do', 'length', 'habit.The', 'soundtrack', 'superb', 'New', 'Order', 'feature', 'Primal', 'Scream', 'begged', 'be', 'allowed', 'write', 'song', 'seeing', 'rough', 'cut', 'movie', 'now', 'find', 'hard', 'not', 'think', 'film', 'opening', 'scene', 'when', 'hear', 'Iggy', 'Pop', 'Lust', 'Life', 'Lou', 'Reed', 'Perfect', 'Day', 'inclusion', 'not', 'entirely', 'unexpected', 'thoroughly', 'welcome.Anyone', 'who', 'Trainspotting', 'drug-taking', 'general', 'heroin', 'use', 'particular', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'watched', 'great', 'deal', 'humor', 'many', 'scenes', 'situations', 'do', 'not', 'present', 'addiction', 'appealing', 'option', 'Renton', 'friends', 'see', 'great', 'deal', 'action', 'constipation', 'when', 'hooked', 'impressive', 'bouts', 'diarrhoea', 'when', 'coming', 'off', 'drug', 'risk', 'catching', 'HIV', '/', 'AIDS', 'sickness', 'brought', 'going', 'cold', 'turkey', 'potentially', 'fatal', 'effects', 'too', 'big', 'hit', 'result', 'not', 'easily', 'offended', 'squeamish', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'watching', 'grandparents']",Trainspotting VHS

413777,A1C8QLFRLHJUJC,6304297912,"Dad, you killed the Zombie Ned Flanders! &#34...","[0, 2]","To be blunt, this is not an easy film to watch. I took the chance because of the brilliance of the director, Danny Boyle, who has helmed such cinema classic as ""Slumdog Millionaire"", ""Sunshine"", ""127 Hours"" and ""28 Days Later"". Slumdog is the first Bollywood movie to be a hit in Hollywood. Sunshine is one of my favorite SciFi films on the 2000's, 28 Days Later is mentioned with the best Zombie movies on nearly every list of best Zombie movies and even 127 Hours manages to make that well known troll, James Franco, look decent and like an A-lister. Let's face it, Danny Boyle has the golden touch.Based on that AND the fact that Trainspotting is getting it's own sequel called ""Porno"", I decided to give Trainspotting a shot. I do not normally watch movies about drug addiction. It hits too close to home and I don't find it funny. Nobody comes into this world saying proudly ""When I grow up, I want to be addicted to heroin."" The thought of having to rob people just so you can buy  drugs so that when you wake up in the morning, you have your morning fix. All that just so you don't start off the day sick. Or that you steal from family and friends until you have no family and no friends, to me, that is depressing and I tend to watch movies that lift my spirit, educate me or scare the hell out of me. I justified that this one met criteria #2 and #3.Like I said, this film is not easy to watch. You are bombarded with images that transcend visceral discomfort. You may well get sick just from watching. As he has shown again and again, Danny Boyle is brilliant, but I would prefer not to watch his vision of Ewan climbing into the grossest commode in the long history of cinema (well done, Scotland!). The thing is it does not condescend or patronize. It exists and I will never watch that scene again.I found this movie disgusting and brilliant.

It is also gross and disgusting, as though Larry Flynt had gotten his hands on something like ""A Clockwork Orange."" But this Brit production with the heavy Scottish brogue (subtitles in places wouldn't hurt) is fortunately more than that; it is original and clever and moves right along. This is partly a cult film with all sorts of indie shibboleths and counter-cultural references; and partly an art film, with splashy sets and studied camera work; but mostly this is a full-blown commercial seduction of contemporary youth, worthy of the talent of somebody at, say, Sony or Pepsi or even the WB. (Yes, that is a left-handed compliment, unless, of course, you want to work for Sony or the WB. We'll have to check with director Danny Boyle on that.)The opening theme (actually voiced over) is the idea that heroin or any really demanding addiction is preferable to ordinary life, an intriguing but stale notion designed to shock the bourgeoisie. The central theme proclaims that a heroin addict is just another kind of junkie, along with your cigarette, cola, beer, sex, grease, etc. junkies. (Bingo!) Yet at the end we see, as one might discover by watching all the commercials on PBS, that money will out. Kinda reminds me of what Omar Khayyam asked about wine nine hundred years ago: ""I wonder...what the Vintners buy/One half so precious as the stuff they sell."" Here the answer is clear: money itself. Closing theme: money triumphs over heroin; money is the power god of heroin.Ewan McGregor is excellent in the leading role as a junkie who is as cute as your brother, with fine support by Robert Carlyle, who plays a bantam who likes to cut people. The script by John Hodge is partly unintelligible, which is good; and the direction by Danny Boyle combines cartoon fantasy with stark realism, slick horror with black comedy, in a manner both derivative and sure to be imitated. The sound track, ""available on Capitol Records,"" (I rest my case) sold well.

Its funny, powerful, uplifting and for me inspiring. Not only that, but it's also got a kick [rear] soundtrack.

Certainly drug culture is everywhere in the movie, but the heart of the film is what the narrator, Ewan MacGregor's character, sees as the obvious link between heroin addiction and working. The central passage of the film is the scene where MacGregor and his mates sprint through the streets, with MacGregor doing the voiceover:""Our only response was to keep on going and [*] everything, pile misery upon misery, heap it up in a spoon and dissolve it with a drop of bile, then squirt it into a stinking purulent vein and do it all over again-keep on going getting up going out robbing stealing and [*] people over, propelling ourselves with longing towards the day that it would all go wrong, because no matter how much you stash, or how much you steal, you never have enough, no matter how often you go out and rob and [*] people over, you always need to get up and do it all over again.""It's a passage that sums up the twin futilities of junkiedom and working class life, and it's no accident that this scene begins with a sprint from a store and ends in a courtroom, marking the twin pillars of a free-market economy. Or that the motive for the sprint--a habit-inspired shoplifting attempt--turns the chase itself into a kind of rat race. It's also no accident that the unrepentant Sick Boy escapes, the cleverly insincere MacGregor gets off easy, while unwitting Spud is nailed to the wall in court. Or that when MacGregor gets clean, his debauched heroin-culture skills of lying, stealing and hustling make him well-suited to a job as a rental agent. Or that the only sincere character in the film is the one undone by deceit, heartbreak, and drugs.In MacGregor's heroin world, the successful cheat as a rule, and they do it overtly; in his exposure to the working world, the same rules apply, everyone knows it, but no one admits it. In this conceit, Trainspotting emerges as a cynically perfect epitaph for American free-market culture spreading across Europe, with its heady mix of genuine aspiration, barely concealed greed, and deep denial--all neatly paralleled by heroin pleasure, heroin addiction, and the brain-addled values of the heroin culture.So while being terrifically stylish and funny on a number of levels, Trainspotting's foundation is what makes it a great film--a disaffected, disillusioned narrator trading one socially rejected role for a socially acceptable one and failing to see the difference between the two. It's a fabulously clever movie with an unnerving argument rifling through every scene, and you should get this DVD.",5,the secret joke of Trainspotting,1054944000,"06 7, 2003",2003,2655,"['giant', 'joke', 'Trainspotting', 'hidden', 'plain', 'sight', 'obscured', 'loaded', 'topic', 'heroin', 'Certainly', 'drug', 'culture', 'everywhere', 'movie', 'heart', 'film', 'what', 'narrator', 'Ewan', 'MacGregor', 'character', 'obvious', 'link', 'heroin', 'addiction', 'working', 'central', 'passage', 'film', 'scene', 'where', 'MacGregor', 'mates', 'sprint', 'streets', 'MacGregor', 'doing', 'voiceover', 'only', 'response', 'was', 'keep', 'going', '[', '*', ']', 'everything', 'pile', 'misery', 'misery', 'heap', 'up', 'spoon', 'dissolve', 'drop', 'bile', 'then', 'squirt', 'stinking', 'purulent', 'vein', 'do', 'again-keep', 'going', 'getting', 'up', 'going', 'robbing', 'stealing', '[', '*', ']', 'people', 'propelling', 'longing', 'towards', 'day', 'would', 'go', 'wrong', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'stash', 'how', 'much', 'steal', 'never', 'have', 'enough', 'matter', 'how', 'often', 'go', 'out', 'rob', '[', '*', ']', 'people', 'always', 'need', 'get', 'up', 'do', 'over', 'again', 'passage', 'up', 'twin', 'futilities', 'junkiedom', 'working', 'class', 'life', 'accident', 'scene', 'sprint', 'store', 'courtroom', 'marking', 'twin', 'pillars', 'free-market', 'economy', 'motive', 'sprint', 'habit-inspired', 'shoplifting', 'attempt', 'chase', 'kind', 'rat', 'race', 'also', 'accident', 'unrepentant', 'Sick', 'Boy', 'cleverly', 'insincere', 'MacGregor', 'easy', 'unwitting', 'Spud', 'nailed', 'wall', 'court', 'when', 'MacGregor', 'clean', 'debauched', 'heroin-culture', 'skills', 'lying', 'stealing', 'hustling', 'make', 'well-suited', 'job', 'rental', 'agent', 'only', 'sincere', 'character', 'film', 'one', 'undone', 'deceit', 'heartbreak', 'MacGregor', 'heroin', 'world', 'successful', 'cheat', 'rule', 'do', 'overtly', 'exposure', 'working', 'world', 'same', 'rules', 'apply', 'everyone', 'one', 'conceit', 'Trainspotting', 'emerges', 'cynically', 'perfect', 'epitaph', 'American', 'free-market', 'culture', 'spreading', 'Europe', 'heady', 'mix', 'genuine', 'aspiration', 'barely', 'concealed', 'greed', 'deep', 'denial', 'neatly', 'paralleled', 'heroin', 'pleasure', 'heroin', 'addiction', 'brain-addled', 'values', 'heroin', 'culture.So', 'being', 'terrifically', 'stylish', 'funny', 'number', 'levels', 'Trainspotting', 'foundation', 'what', 'great', 'film', 'disaffected', 'disillusioned', 'narrator', 'trading', 'one', 'socially', 'rejected', 'role', 'socially', 'acceptable', 'one', 'failing', 'see', 'difference', 'two', 'fabulously', 'clever', 'movie', 'unnerving', 'argument', 'rifling', 'scene', 'should', 'get', 'DVD']",Trainspotting VHS

I was an active heroin user at the time, but also found the movie extremely good (what I could remember of it). Of course when I did see it, I was also under the influence of the drug, so i wasn't constantly conscience through parts of it. For the past 3 years i have been in recovery, and could NOT bring myself to watch it,(although I  did want to see it again) on account that I feared bringing heroin back into my thoughts, and perhaps thinking of only the ""good things"" it did for me. But anyway, I did decide to rent it just recently, because my wife, who is also in recovery, wanted to see it for the first time. The experience I got from it this time was not of glamour, but of the absolute, gut-wretching, not wanting to go on anymore, just wanting to end the pain and die attitude, and the dead-end street in had brought to my life. This movie is truly a wake-up call, and a remember when for me. Something I would NOT ever want to go back to, but also something I want to keep up front to remember what it really did do to my life and the depths it brought me down to. The junkie-life in Scotland, is the same there, as it is here or anywhere else in the world for that matter. The movie doesn't flinch from depicting the horrid consequences of heroin use, but it never lets you forget that most people do it because it feels better than anything else.

I appreciated the fact that it painted a realistic picture of heroin addicts and their recoveries and relapses, European club life, and intertwined Aids, hanging around the wrong people but still calling them friends, and showing some light at the end of the tunnel without being cheesey or cliche.McGregor was great as the lead character and the troubles his close circles of friends have was very a-typical of a serious drug addict.  The way they took advantage of him and displayed such bad taste and dishonesty, and their sleazy lifestyles is something any drug addict experiences most assuredly to some degree.  A normally good person with caring parents finds himself hanging out with losers and creeps and continually justifies his reason for putting up with them, and has to, because of his or her drug habit.The scenes dealing with fecal matter were unnessecary I thought, a bit over the top and not very funny, just a bit too juvenille and shock-oriented, but regardless they were brief and the symbolism of him diving head first into a toilet was actually very good....that addicts will sink to almost any level to feed their habits, and do things they normally would never even think of sober.This film really wasn't a black comedy to me, as many made it out to be, it was humorous at times, but also very serious and disturbing more often than not, without being depressing and unwatchable, such as ""Requiem For A Dream"" was in my opinion.Trainspotting is simply a very good film and one of my modern favorites.",4,"A bit juvenille at times, but otherwise a very good film",1014854400,"02 28, 2002",2002,1619,"['Trainspotting', 'was', 'one', 'avoided', 'theaters', 'waited', 'DVD', 'reason', 'appreciated', 'fact', 'painted', 'realistic', 'picture', 'heroin', 'addicts', 'recoveries', 'relapses', 'European', 'club', 'life', 'intertwined', 'Aids', 'hanging', 'wrong', 'people', 'still', 'calling', 'friends', 'showing', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel', 'being', 'cheesey', 'cliche.McGregor', 'was', 'great', 'lead', 'character', 'troubles', 'close', 'circles', 'friends', 'have', 'was', 'very', 'a-typical', 'serious', 'drug', 'addict', 'way', 'took', 'advantage', 'displayed', 'such', 'bad', 'taste', 'dishonesty', 'sleazy', 'lifestyles', 'something', 'drug', 'addict', 'most', 'assuredly', 'degree', 'A', 'normally', 'good', 'person', 'caring', 'parents', 'hanging', 'out', 'losers', 'creeps', 'continually', 'justifies', 'reason', 'putting', 'up', 'drug', 'habit.The', 'scenes', 'dealing', 'fecal', 'matter', 'were', 'unnessecary', 'thought', 'bit', 'top', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'juvenille', 'shock-oriented', 'regardless', 'were', 'brief', 'symbolism', 'diving', 'head', 'first', 'toilet', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'good', '.that', 'will', 'sink', 'almost', 'level', 'feed', 'habits', 'do', 'things', 'normally', 'would', 'never', 'even', 'think', 'sober.This', 'film', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'black', 'comedy', 'many', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'was', 'humorous', 'times', 'also', 'very', 'serious', 'disturbing', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'being', 'depressing', 'unwatchable', 'such', 'Requiem', 'A', 'Dream', 'was', 'opinion.Trainspotting', 'simply', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'one', 'modern', 'favorites']",Trainspotting VHS

He and his friends trip through life only living for the next shot of H and wondering how to get the money for it. They live in shabby, sparsely decorated flats and live on ratty mattresses and, for the most part, have no goal in life except ultimate pleasure for life. Renton however has more depth and yearning for something more and sets upon a quest to clean up his act and live like those he once denounced. Dark humor and stark realization are constantly presented during the film and thankfully the movie doesnt ever sacrifice one in favor of the other.

They practice drugs as if it were some kind of hobby, not really to experience some drug-produced hallucinations but a drug-induced escape from real society, from fear, from hunger, from thirst, from their basic needs and impulses. Yet they reduce themselves to those very basic impulses and live an experience that has nothing else to propose, to offer but suffering from and amplifying those impulses. They find the morbid pleasure, at times deeply wrapped up in scatological regression, of experiencing these impulses without any limitations. This of course leads them to activities that have nothing to do with intelligence, the intellectual understanding of their alienations, but everything to do with considering society as a field  for their hunting, even scavenging. But what do they hunt ? Money, adventure, the power of doing what is forbidden, the thrill of getting into supposedly unexplored feelings and intense emotions. Their life becomes a jungle where emotions and feelings are driving forces and fascinating objectives. A baby dies because of the lack of care and love that is needed for it to survive or to live, but that death becomes the center of some  pleasure , the  pleasure  of suffering in the hands of death. One will thus die in this search by getting used to starving and finally passing away because this experiment has no other exit. One will be forced by his parents to go cold turkey and establish a distance between himself and that morbidity. Another will be sent to prison and forced to cut off from those extreme habits. And strangely enough it is those two who will manage to get some profit out of it, hence the means to cut off the umbilical cord that attaches them to this alienation. This epiphany will be reached through betrayal but it is seen by the two as some kind of a new beginning, as a door leading to another life, the life they have been longing for for so long, the life of normal people blending in the social mass around them, even if they have to escape to some other niche where their strange past can be unknown and forgotten. This is the dilemma of so many young people who want to experience adventure and a wilderness that does not exist naturally in our societies. They create with their own hands a wilderness in which they can experience the fear and dangers of a jungle that is more a creation of their own than real. And yet we have to come to the conclusion that our societies do enable such young people to find and build this jungle. Maybe this jungle is part of our societies, even if it is mostly invisible.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan",4,Warhol revisited from an English point of view,1042934400,"01 19, 2003",2003,2795,"['film', 'way', 'masterpiece', 'vision', 'how', 'young', 'men', 'influenced', 'organized', 'older', 'men', 'live', 'margin', 'society', 'fringe', 'normalcy', 'practice', 'drugs', 'were', 'kind', 'hobby', 'not', 'really', 'experience', 'drug-produced', 'hallucinations', 'drug-induced', 'escape', 'real', 'society', 'fear', 'hunger', 'thirst', 'basic', 'needs', 'impulses', 'reduce', 'very', 'basic', 'impulses', 'live', 'experience', 'nothing', 'else', 'propose', 'offer', 'suffering', 'amplifying', 'impulses', 'find', 'morbid', 'pleasure', 'times', 'deeply', 'wrapped', 'up', 'scatological', 'regression', 'experiencing', 'impulses', 'limitations', 'course', 'activities', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'intelligence', 'intellectual', 'understanding', 'alienations', 'everything', 'do', 'considering', 'society', 'field', 'hunting', 'even', 'scavenging', 'what', 'do', 'hunt', 'Money', 'adventure', 'power', 'doing', 'what', 'forbidden', 'thrill', 'getting', 'supposedly', 'unexplored', 'feelings', 'intense', 'emotions', 'life', 'jungle', 'where', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'are', 'driving', 'forces', 'fascinating', 'objectives', 'baby', 'lack', 'care', 'love', 'needed', 'survive', 'live', 'death', 'center', 'pleasure', 'pleasure', 'suffering', 'hands', 'death', 'One', 'will', 'thus', 'die', 'search', 'getting', 'used', 'starving', 'finally', 'passing', 'away', 'experiment', 'other', 'exit', 'One', 'will', 'be', 'forced', 'parents', 'go', 'cold', 'turkey', 'establish', 'distance', 'morbidity', 'will', 'be', 'sent', 'prison', 'forced', 'cut', 'off', 'extreme', 'habits', 'strangely', 'enough', 'two', 'who', 'will', 'manage', 'get', 'profit', 'hence', 'means', 'cut', 'off', 'umbilical', 'cord', 'alienation', 'epiphany', 'will', 'be', 'reached', 'betrayal', 'seen', 'two', 'kind', 'new', 'beginning', 'door', 'leading', 'life', 'life', 'have', 'been', 'longing', 'so', 'long', 'life', 'normal', 'people', 'blending', 'social', 'mass', 'even', 'have', 'escape', 'other', 'niche', 'where', 'strange', 'past', 'can', 'be', 'unknown', 'forgotten', 'dilemma', 'so', 'many', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'experience', 'adventure', 'wilderness', 'not', 'exist', 'naturally', 'societies', 'create', 'own', 'hands', 'wilderness', 'can', 'experience', 'fear', 'dangers', 'jungle', 'more', 'creation', 'own', 'real', 'yet', 'have', 'come', 'conclusion', 'societies', 'do', 'enable', 'such', 'young', 'people', 'find', 'build', 'jungle', 'Maybe', 'jungle', 'part', 'societies', 'even', 'mostly', 'invisible.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Perpignan']",Trainspotting VHS

When we are introduced to these characters that make up his circle of friends, Tommy, Sick Boy, Begbie and Spud all the time moving to the sounds of Iggy Pop's catchy ""Lust for life"" we know we are in for a treat. The movie is a humorous, dark, cynical, satirical look at the life of a junkie and the effects of heroin on the lives of himself and his friends.It also comes across as a social commentary piece, juxtaposing the mundane activites of everyday society with the fixed purpose of a ""sincere and honest"" drug habit. The movie in no way condones the use of drugs but does show the kinds of motivation that initiate it. It's very postmodern in that the movie critiques the ""grandnarratives"" of modern society and shows how empty and supeficial they are, even to the extent that a drug habit is more appealing than living exposed to modern-day plastic consumerism hyper reality. The superficiality of society and the norms are starkly contrasted with the real, physical, painful, purposeful life that governs and directs someone on smack!Apart from the postmodern themes and ideas that the movie posits, at the end of the day it's just a great piece of extraordinary filmmaking with delighful exchanges, a wonderful soundtrack and a lot of jokes about Sean Connnery!I don't want to spoil any more of the suprise so all I can do is suggest that you go out and buy this NOW!

413818,A2C5LA07JCDWTN,6304297912,"J. Brittman ""The Bottom Line""","[14, 19]","I first caught Trainspotting in '96 when it was released in theaters. I had not read the book but I figured a movie about Scottish hoodlums who were heroin addicts sounded interesting, so I checked it out. Man, what a film! The cast was flawlessly assembled by director Danny Boyle and includes a career making performance by Ewen McGregor. But, McGregor's supporting cast is what really makes Trainspotting stand out above most other films. Robert Carlyle is simultaneously hilarious and chilling as Begbie, the elder statesman of the group who in fact is the only one who is not a heroin addict. As Renton(McGregor's character) states ""...Begbie didn't do drugs, he did people."" So true. Begbie is a psychopath in the purist sense of the word. He's a thief, a batterer, and a big time alcoholic, not the kind of guy you want to piss off. Carlyle literally steals every scene he is in and is almost impossible to understand with his ultra-thick Scottish accent. Jonny Lee Miller plays Sick Boy, the pretty boy of the group who also happens to be the most well adjusted with the innate ability to dump his heroin addiction cold turkey. Ewen Bremner plays the dummy of the group to perfection, he is crude and slow-witted but ultimately good hearted. Ewen McGregor's Renton is a complex and dark character who is torn between doing the right thing and living a clean, normal life and his terrible addiction. Trainspotting is a realistic film. Renton doesn't just kick his habit but goes through several relapses. Renton wants a better life for himself but needs a break to get out of his lower class town and towards the end of the film the opportunity presents itself. Trainspotting has been called ""A Clockwork Orange for the '90's"" which I tend to disagree with. Trainspotting is not a visual journey as Clockwork is but they are both a study of human nature. Trainspotting's central characters are nowhere near as vicious as Kubrick's Droogs who raped, beat, stole, and terrorized at will. Boyle's characters have heart and you can feel their pain and emotions, you ultimately come to care about them. In Clockwork, Alex is finally getting his just desserts. Anyway, Trainspotting a great watch and addition to any DVD collection.

Most people have ignored it - one reviewer thought it was a reference to the frequency of shooting up. As an (ex) Brit, who grew up in Scotland, when I saw it, some time ago, I just automatically assumed something quite different.*** BUT - see the reader's comment below! An informative correction to the ideas that follow! ***First - trainspotting is an actual hobby in Britain. Remember that this is a small country with a dense and active rail network. Lots of people are really, really interested in trains, but trainspotting is kind of the very lowest-grade interest.  Trainspotters stand around stations, or major rail junctions, or marshalling yards, and just collect train facts - usually engine numbers, sometimes appearances of some particular kind of rolling stock. That is all they do - make lists!  (Or sometimes trade number lists with other spotters, or exult in the size of their list).  So the image of a trainspotter is a low-energy person, very conventional in outlook, probably standing for hours in the rain in a shabby raincoat...one who has pretty much given up on ever doing anything exciting and who absolutely needs to get a life!  Collecting train numbers is basically pure, time-consuming obsession. Collecting stamps or beer mats or matchbooks, or any of the thousand other odd things people collect, sometimes has another dimension - artistic interest, investment, etc - train numbers lead nowhere.So to me the title ""Trainspotting"" was a sardonic reminder of the monotonous, meaningless ""normal"" life that the guys were rebelling against and trying to escape from - unwisely, but desperately - in their drug usage. It was the background against which the vivid and certainly scary picture was painted.Hope this was helpful. Would be interesting to hear from anyone associated with the movie if that's right - as I say, it was just the natural., automatic interpretation for me.PS - after reading many, many reviews - why is it that so many otherwise literate people just cannot spell the words definite and definitely? Many keep thinking there's an A in there somewhere...one even wrote ""defiantly"" which gave an interesting and unintended twist, and of course passed spell-check...Oh well.",5,A few words about the title,1163203200,"11 11, 2006",2006,2332,"['Plenty', 'reviews', 'have', 'described', 'amazing', 'movie', ""'d"", 'just', 'like', 'add', 'note', 'meaning', 'title', 'Most', 'people', 'have', 'ignored', 'one', 'reviewer', 'thought', 'was', 'reference', 'frequency', 'shooting', 'up', 'ex', 'Brit', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Scotland', 'when', 'saw', 'time', 'just', 'automatically', 'assumed', 'something', 'quite', 'different', '***', 'BUT', 'see', 'reader', 'comment', 'informative', 'correction', 'ideas', 'follow', '***First', 'trainspotting', 'actual', 'hobby', 'Britain', 'Remember', 'small', 'country', 'dense', 'active', 'rail', 'network', 'Lots', 'people', 'are', 'really', 'really', 'interested', 'trains', 'trainspotting', 'kind', 'very', 'lowest-grade', 'interest', 'Trainspotters', 'stand', 'stations', 'major', 'rail', 'junctions', 'marshalling', 'yards', 'just', 'collect', 'train', 'facts', 'usually', 'engine', 'numbers', 'sometimes', 'appearances', 'particular', 'kind', 'rolling', 'stock', 'do', 'make', 'lists', 'sometimes', 'trade', 'number', 'lists', 'other', 'spotters', 'exult', 'size', 'list', 'image', 'trainspotter', 'low-energy', 'person', 'very', 'conventional', 'outlook', 'probably', 'standing', 'hours', 'rain', 'shabby', 'raincoat', 'one', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'given', 'up', 'ever', 'doing', 'anything', 'exciting', 'who', 'absolutely', 'get', 'life', 'Collecting', 'train', 'numbers', 'basically', 'pure', 'time-consuming', 'obsession', 'Collecting', 'stamps', 'beer', 'mats', 'matchbooks', 'thousand', 'other', 'odd', 'things', 'people', 'collect', 'sometimes', 'dimension', 'artistic', 'interest', 'investment', 'etc', 'train', 'numbers', 'lead', 'nowhere.So', 'title', 'Trainspotting', 'was', 'sardonic', 'reminder', 'monotonous', 'meaningless', 'normal', 'life', 'guys', 'were', 'rebelling', 'trying', 'escape', 'unwisely', 'desperately', 'drug', 'usage', 'was', 'background', 'vivid', 'certainly', 'scary', 'picture', 'was', 'painted.Hope', 'was', 'helpful', 'Would', 'be', 'interesting', 'hear', 'anyone', 'associated', 'movie', 'right', 'say', 'was', 'just', 'natural.', 'automatic', 'interpretation', 'me.PS', 'reading', 'many', 'many', 'reviews', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'otherwise', 'literate', 'people', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'spell', 'words', 'definite', 'definitely', 'Many', 'keep', 'thinking', 'A', 'somewhere', 'one', 'even', 'wrote', 'defiantly', 'gave', 'interesting', 'unintended', 'twist', 'course', 'passed', 'spell-check', 'Oh', 'well']",Trainspotting VHS

Essentially it was the same movie, but the video itself included additional footage in the form of deleted scenes and interview footage with the director Danny Boyle and producer Andrew Macdonald.  We could get &quot;unofficial&quot; copies of &quot;the green version&quot; in the 'States, but the tape quality was always iffy at best.Fast forward a few years later to the advent of DVD technology and the ability of film and video distributors to release not only movies on a digital disc, but also multiple layers of special features designed to add to the enjoyment of the movie and add versatility to the disc itself; movie fans get more out of owning their favorite (sorry, favourite) films.Except for &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, which was released initially in a very &quot;bare bones&quot; package, even though most fans of the movie KNEW there was a lot more footage available that would make for a more interesting presentation.  Not even so much as a theatrical trailer was included, but it was a great movie so we still bought it.Fast-forward to today:  Canadian movie buffs HAVE AT LAST been given a respectable presentation of &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, including the documentary footage with deleted scenes and a glossary of terms included on the DVD insert (similar to that found at the back of the Irvine Welsh novel) assisting the Scottishly impaired with the terminology found within the movie (the dialect itself is another matter, but of course the English subtitles overcome any defficiencies with the dialect that the VHS tape may have fostered).Sadly, the release of &quot;Trainspotting:  The Definitive Edition&quot; in the United Kingdom earlier this year confirms that as good as this &quot;Widescreen Collector's Edition&quot; is, it could still be even better (and may be so in the future).  Of course, the region coding for UK-based DVD's prevents them from being played on this side of the pond, so this version represents the best edition that we will see for at least another few years.And because US-based DVD players utilize the same Region 1 format as those from Canada, the discriminating US shopper is going to make it a point to choose this Canadian edition over the plain old boring Miramax/Buena Vista Home Entertainment version we've had to make do with over the last several years.",5,"Go, Canada, Go!!!",1070150400,"11 30, 2003",2003,2607,"['little', 'background', 'information', 'regarding', 'DVD', 'edition', 'When', 'quot', 'Trainspotting', 'quot', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'video', 'back', ""'90"", 'were', 'tantalized', 'side', 'Atlantic', 'Ocean', 'alternate', 'version', 'video', 'known', 'informally', 'quot', 'green', 'version', 'quot', 'Essentially', 'was', 'same', 'movie', 'video', 'included', 'additional', 'footage', 'form', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'interview', 'footage', 'director', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'producer', 'Andrew', 'Macdonald', 'could', 'get', 'quot', 'unofficial', 'quot', 'copies', 'quot', 'green', 'version', 'quot', ""'States"", 'tape', 'quality', 'was', 'always', 'iffy', 'best.Fast', 'forward', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'advent', 'DVD', 'technology', 'ability', 'film', 'video', 'distributors', 'release', 'not', 'only', 'movies', 'digital', 'disc', 'also', 'multiple', 'layers', 'special', 'features', 'designed', 'add', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'add', 'versatility', 'disc', 'movie', 'fans', 'get', 'more', 'owning', 'favorite', 'sorry', 'favourite', 'films.Except', 'quot', 'Trainspotting', 'quot', 'was', 'released', 'initially', 'very', 'quot', 'bare', 'bones', 'quot', 'package', 'even', 'most', 'fans', 'movie', 'KNEW', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'footage', 'available', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'interesting', 'presentation', 'Not', 'even', 'so', 'much', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'was', 'included', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'still', 'bought', 'it.Fast-forward', 'today', 'Canadian', 'movie', 'buffs', 'HAVE', 'AT', 'LAST', 'been', 'given', 'respectable', 'presentation', 'quot', 'Trainspotting', 'quot', 'including', 'documentary', 'footage', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'glossary', 'terms', 'included', 'DVD', 'insert', 'similar', 'found', 'back', 'Irvine', 'Welsh', 'novel', 'assisting', 'Scottishly', 'impaired', 'terminology', 'found', 'movie', 'dialect', 'matter', 'course', 'English', 'subtitles', 'overcome', 'defficiencies', 'dialect', 'VHS', 'tape', 'may', 'have', 'fostered', '.Sadly', 'release', 'quot', 'Trainspotting', 'Definitive', 'Edition', 'quot', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'earlier', 'year', 'as', 'good', 'quot', 'Widescreen', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'quot', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'may', 'be', 'so', 'future', 'course', 'region', 'coding', 'UK-based', 'DVD', 'prevents', 'being', 'played', 'side', 'pond', 'version', 'best', 'edition', 'will', 'see', 'least', 'few', 'years.And', 'US-based', 'DVD', 'players', 'utilize', 'same', 'Region', '1', 'format', 'Canada', 'discriminating', 'US', 'shopper', 'going', 'make', 'point', 'choose', 'Canadian', 'edition', 'plain', 'old', 'boring', 'Miramax/Buena', 'Vista', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'version', ""'ve"", 'had', 'make', 'do', 'last', 'several', 'years']",Trainspotting VHS

413830,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6304297912,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[5, 5]","In 1996, director Danny Boyle made a name for himself with his adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel Trainspotting. Over the years, the film has continued to be a great success with critics and audiences, growing a larger fanbase with every passing year. Now, the film has debuted on Blu-Ray so fans can finally enjoy the film in high-definition.MOVIE:Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) is the narrator and protagonist, a young man who has chosen to live his life as a heroin addict in Scotland. Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), Spud (Ewen Bremner), Begbie (Robert Carlyle), and the clean-cut, non-addict Tommy (Kevin McKidd) comprise Renton's close circle of friends, all essentially in the same boat as him. The film progresses in a mostly episodic way, following Renton through his heroin addiction, his multiple attempts to quit and stay clean, and the trouble his addiction frequently gets him in. Nearly every scene is an example of Renton getting himself into trouble and trying to find his way out, be it getting in trouble with the cops or accidentally sleeping with a young schoolgirl (Kelly Macdonald). Trainspotting has a straight-forward narrative, but doesn't allow itself to be restricted by it. This is a film that moves with energy and purpose.With a running time of only 90 minutes, its remarkable how much happens. While it maintains a singular tone throughout, there's a combination of genres within the movie that probably account for its continuing popularity. It's character-driven, with very memorable characters and is very funny at one moment and very tragic the next. It effectively uses surreal imagery, such as Renton's famous toilet-diving scene, while also functioning as a strong drug movie, allowing the characters to romanticize heroin while showing the tragedy that accompanies the use of the drug.The soundtrack, consisting of both classical and pop music, the brightly colored cinematography, and the overall composition heavily recalls Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. When the characters go to a club, the layout of the club reveals this as intentional. Trainspotting was actually edited by the studio due to the heavy Scottish accents and their fear that American audiences would have trouble understanding them. Well, I admittedly had trouble with them at times but it's all about paying attention (and some extra help from subtitles perhaps). Darkly funny, with memorable characters, a stunning performance by McGregor, and uniquely flavored direction by Danny Boyle; Trainspotting is a pop-culture masterpiece that won't lose steam any time soon.BLU-RAY:In case you're wondering, the Blu-Ray looks stunning. I compared a scene from both the Blu-Ray and the DVD on the same 1080p TV and even the most untrained eye could notice a substantial difference in picture-quality. The beauty and color of the film nearly pop out of the screen, however, technical aspects aside, the Blu-Ray is not quite perfect. First of all, it's not the uncut edition which has an extended sex scene and a shot of a heroin needle penetrating a vein. These changes don't affect the plot, but most people would rather see a film in its intended form. In addition, the Blu-Ray's special features are lacking.

Ewan McGregor is a very underrated actor and he's brilliant as a junkie in this film. This movie really hit me hard showing the despair of addiction. Some people survive it and some don't. This movie is a great depiction of the struggles each character goes through in their fight with addiction. Heroine was already something i would never do but after this movie it shows that its one of the most dangerous things you can mess with. Anyway I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie is.

I remember, as I finished the film, thoroughly hating it. There was something about its subject matter and characters that I immediately found off putting. It wasn't until my third or fourth viewing of the picture that I really understood what Boyle was going for.It's supposed to be off putting and the characters are supposed to be unlikable. The film shows just how much of an impact heroin can have on a young individual's life. It destroys it to the point where heroin because the only that the really matters. For these young drug addicts, the only thing that gets them through the day is the anticipation of the next hit. By using over-the-top visuals (the sequence with the dead infant in the crib is one that I won't be able to shake for sometime) and a rapid MTV music video style editing, Boyle makes the film visually fascinating while showing the truth behind the life of the average drug addict.If I have a problem with the film it's that it really doesn't go far enough. Less quick cutting and hyper stylized editing and more human characters would have made the film deeper and more palatable. But, maybe that wasn't what Boyle was going for. With his use of editing, he shows just how much can be lost when one is stuck in the sad world of drug addiction. That, in and of itself, makes the film something special. The film is gritty and dark, both qualities that are rarely seen in Hollywood movies today. I still think the ending doesn't work as well as it should as it feels a bit too upbeat but that's a minor quibble of an otherwise fine film.",4,A Day in the Life of a Drug Addict,1262131200,"12 30, 2009",2009,1702,"['Danny', 'Boyle', 'Trainspotting', 'film', 'left', 'perplexed', 'ever', 'first', 'time', 'viewed', 'teenager', 'nearly', 'decade', 'ago', 'remember', 'finished', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'hating', 'was', 'something', 'subject', 'matter', 'characters', 'immediately', 'found', 'off', 'putting', 'was', ""n't"", 'third', 'fourth', 'viewing', 'picture', 'really', 'understood', 'what', 'Boyle', 'was', 'going', 'for.It', 'supposed', 'be', 'off', 'putting', 'characters', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'unlikable', 'film', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'impact', 'heroin', 'can', 'have', 'young', 'individual', 'life', 'point', 'where', 'heroin', 'only', 'really', 'matters', 'young', 'drug', 'addicts', 'only', 'thing', 'day', 'anticipation', 'next', 'hit', 'using', 'over-the-top', 'visuals', 'sequence', 'dead', 'infant', 'crib', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'shake', 'sometime', 'rapid', 'MTV', 'music', 'video', 'style', 'editing', 'Boyle', 'film', 'visually', 'fascinating', 'showing', 'truth', 'life', 'average', 'drug', 'addict.If', 'have', 'problem', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'enough', 'Less', 'quick', 'cutting', 'hyper', 'stylized', 'editing', 'more', 'human', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'deeper', 'more', 'palatable', 'maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'Boyle', 'was', 'going', 'use', 'editing', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'lost', 'when', 'one', 'stuck', 'sad', 'world', 'drug', 'addiction', 'film', 'something', 'special', 'film', 'gritty', 'dark', 'qualities', 'are', 'rarely', 'seen', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'today', 'still', 'think', 'ending', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'bit', 'too', 'upbeat', 'minor', 'quibble', 'otherwise', 'fine', 'film']",Trainspotting VHS

413839,A2YQ5O6XV23543,6304297912,Kevin H. Dudley,"[6, 6]","Trainspotting is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion. It's funny, sad, tragic, horrific and cautionary too without being preachy of the dangers of heroin. Highly re-watchable considering some of the most shocking and at times potentially repellant scenes to ever appear in a mainstream film. It still is director Danny Boyle's best film to date.Regarding Lionsgate's blu-ray of Trainspotting, there has been a bit of controversy. There had been a few years back a 2 disc collector's edition of the film which presented it in its international cut that differed very slightly from the American R rated cut. To avoid an NC-17 rating, a couple of seconds were trimmed from the sex scene involving Ewan McGregor's character and a girl he meets at a club. The filmmakers also had to substitute a few shots amounting to only about 3 or so seconds in this same sex scene and also substitute a later shot of a needle breaking Ewan's arm during his overdose scene with a shot of his face instead. To be honest, the slight changes in the American R rated cut are imperceptible unless you've seen the uncut version and even then, it's really not a big deal at all.For the film's American blu-ray release though, Lionsgate used the R rated version instead of the uncut international version. While I was ever so slightly disappointed in that fact, the positives of this hi-def release greatly outweigh this particular fact. Colors are greatly improved along with much better contrast and detail compared to the DVD. In fact, the blu-ray makes the DVD look positively washed out in comparison. There is a nice filmic layer of grain throughout and I couldn't spot any instances of any digital noise reduction. This blu-ray simply blows the older DVD out of the water and is truly like seeing the film all over again for the first time. Audio is presented in lossles 5.1 DTS sound.All of the extras from the 2 disc DVD collector's edition were carried over. If you own the prior DVD and are a completist like myself, I just threw away the pointless digital copy and instead kept the first disc of the 2-disc DVD to still have the uncut intertional version. There is a 2 disc blu-ray release in Europe that contains the uncut version but it is region B locked so unless you have a region free blu-ray player, the Lionsgate blu-ray is the best way to go.While I'm not sure why Lionsgate put the R rated cut on the blu-ray, that is the only thing that slightly keeps this release from being definitive. But it really is a very minor differance. Like I mentioned earlier though, the picture quality is a quantum leap over the DVD and is still well worth the upgrade.

Not to mention abevy of superb, brave performances.This study of 4 young mates in Scotland, 3 drug addicts, and one addicted to violence reminds me in some ways ofPaul Thomas Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"".  Both take us behind the scenes of dark, dysfunctional works (drugs, porn),but do so with a sense of humor and humanity that transcends clich&eacute;s and makes us relate to these characters ashuman beings, not just porn stars or drug addicts.  These are both films full of ideas about choices and morality,without ever feeling moralistic or judgmental, and both use their central world as metaphors for the bigger worldsaround them.  You might escape porn, or drugs, but you can't escape the forces that push people into them,(spoiler ahead!)Indeed I'm surprised to read so many reviews claiming Trainspotting's ending is optimistic.  Yes Renton is walkingaway from drugs, but he's also stabbing his mates in the back, and joining a world that's just as obsessive aboutmoney, success, drink, sex, material things, as an addict is about drugs.  To me, that's what the whole, chillingly`choose life' monologue that bookends the film is all about.  Truly `choosing life' is about a lot more than justsaying `no' to drugs.Not to mention the title `Trainspotting' which refers to the innocent, but still obsessive, humanity-disconnectedhobby of noting down types and times of trains that go by.

413842,A2ICI500LRO01K,6304297912,Kyle Wells,"[13, 14]","""Trainspotting"" is another film that proves the vitality and originality of the British cinema.  The film pulsates with energy, talent and an  understanding of the heroin scene.  This is by-and-far one of the great  modern British films.  ""Trainspotting"" is a film, that along with ""Lock,  Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", proves that the American film industry does  not run the entire business.Upon a viewing of Danny Boyle's 1996 film  ""Trainspotting"" you will laugh in hysterics, revolt in horror, gasp in  excitement and feel sick with disgust.  Any movie that can bring about such  an array of emotions has to be a high quality, well made film.  ""Trainspotting"" is just that.  It shows us a world that most of us have  never experienced (thankfully) but does exist and needs to be documented.  It takes no liberties, pulls no stops and presents it to us in such a  stark, gripping and entertaining manner that we end up feeling that we too  have somehow lived that live.Some people bashed this film, saying it  condoned the use of drugs.  This quite simply is ridiculous.  Just because  the film doesn't preach at us and try to influence our views and merely  shows us this life, doesn't mean it condones drug usage. The film assumes  we can figure out for ourselves that this is no way to live and I think  most of us did.  If anything the film makes us want to stay away from  drugs.The story is about a group of five friends in Edinburgh, Scotland:  Renton, Begbie, Sick Boy, Spud and Tommy.  Three of the lads are addicted  to heroin but only Renton seems to have any interest in kicking the habit.  The lads fall in and out of many situations throughout the film including  AIDS, prison and a hilarious happening involving a tape of Tommy and his  girlfriend.  But no matter what they're up to, the most important thing is  always heroin.  All their actions revolve around it whether it be getting  it, doing it, selling it or kicking it.A police officer I met, who works  the drug/slum area in Vancouver said that this film was the most realistic  portrayal of addicts he had ever seen and from what I know I'd have to  agree with him.  ""Drugstore Cowboy"" is the only other film I can think of  that tackles the drug culture so realistically.The acting is fantastic,  with Ewan McGregor as Renton being a standout.  He manages to put some  credibility and human qualities to a type of person we would often think of  as inhuman.  Mix the great acting with the perfectly timed and energetic  directing of Danny Boyle (including one fantastic withdrawal sequence) and  add in one great soundtrack including Iggy (not Ziggy) Pop and Blur and  you've got yourself a beautiful and brilliant movie.Thanxs...",5,A Hilarious and Gripping Movie.,966384000,"08 16, 2000",2000,2712,"['Trainspotting', 'film', 'vitality', 'originality', 'British', 'cinema', 'film', 'energy', 'talent', 'understanding', 'heroin', 'scene', 'by-and-far', 'one', 'great', 'modern', 'British', 'films', 'Trainspotting', 'film', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'Two', 'Smoking', 'Barrels', 'American', 'film', 'industry', 'not', 'run', 'entire', 'business.Upon', 'viewing', 'Danny', 'Boyle', '1996', 'film', 'Trainspotting', 'will', 'laugh', 'hysterics', 'revolt', 'horror', 'gasp', 'excitement', 'feel', 'sick', 'disgust', 'movie', 'can', 'bring', 'about', 'such', 'array', 'emotions', 'be', 'high', 'quality', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'Trainspotting', 'just', 'world', 'most', 'have', 'never', 'experienced', 'thankfully', 'exist', 'needs', 'be', 'documented', 'liberties', 'stops', 'presents', 'stark', 'gripping', 'entertaining', 'manner', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'too', 'have', 'somehow', 'lived', 'live.Some', 'people', 'bashed', 'film', 'saying', 'condoned', 'use', 'drugs', 'quite', 'simply', 'ridiculous', 'Just', 'film', ""n't"", 'preach', 'try', 'influence', 'views', 'merely', 'life', ""n't"", 'mean', 'condones', 'drug', 'usage', 'film', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'ourselves', 'way', 'live', 'think', 'most', 'did', 'anything', 'film', 'want', 'stay', 'away', 'drugs.The', 'story', 'group', 'five', 'friends', 'Edinburgh', 'Scotland', 'Renton', 'Begbie', 'Sick', 'Boy', 'Spud', 'Tommy', 'Three', 'lads', 'are', 'addicted', 'heroin', 'only', 'Renton', 'have', 'interest', 'kicking', 'habit', 'lads', 'fall', 'many', 'situations', 'film', 'including', 'AIDS', 'prison', 'hilarious', 'happening', 'involving', 'tape', 'Tommy', 'girlfriend', 'matter', 'what', ""'re"", 'up', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'always', 'heroin', 'actions', 'revolve', 'be', 'getting', 'doing', 'selling', 'kicking', 'it.A', 'police', 'officer', 'met', 'who', 'drug/slum', 'area', 'Vancouver', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'most', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'addicts', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'what', 'know', ""'d"", 'have', 'agree', 'Drugstore', 'Cowboy', 'only', 'other', 'film', 'can', 'think', 'drug', 'culture', 'realistically.The', 'acting', 'fantastic', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Renton', 'being', 'standout', 'put', 'credibility', 'human', 'qualities', 'type', 'person', 'would', 'often', 'think', 'inhuman', 'Mix', 'great', 'acting', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'energetic', 'directing', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'including', 'one', 'fantastic', 'withdrawal', 'sequence', 'add', 'one', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'including', 'Iggy', 'not', 'Ziggy', 'Pop', 'Blur', ""'ve"", 'got', 'beautiful', 'brilliant', 'movie.Thanxs']",Trainspotting VHS

413846,A1TDDM47OJQ3KL,6304297912,"Lisa McKinley ""lisa_in_so_cal""","[130, 141]","I'd like to begin this review with my pre-viewing expectations - - ZILCH!  I had never heard of this movie, had not viewed the trailer or read the box, I just sat down on my sofa as my husband pressed ""play"" on the remote and jumped right in with both feet.  The first few minutes made me squirm, I was thinking ""oh no, a movie glorifying drugs, with lots of F-words and thick accents"", but the narration of the main character, Mark Renton, was intellectually stimulating, so I listened more closely and allowed myself to become immersed in the story.  The characters in this story are ugly, heroin-addicted losers, but they are portrayed as very real people - - yes, they are bad, but they are not evil.  Their lives are extremely grim and repugnant.  I've always wondered how people addicted to heroin can live their lives thinking they are living normally, and the addiction is so powerful it renders them powerless to live any other way, but then I realized almost anything can be considered an addiction - - we all wrestle with something, be it our weight, our ethics, our punctuality, etc..  Moments when we convince ourselves it will be the last time, until the next time.The film makes some interesting comparisons between a ""normal"" life, and the twisted lives of these characters.  You notice small hypocrisies, such as the friend in the pub railing against drug use, while he obviously has an alcohol and an anger-management problem.  This film also addresses the issues of loyalty, culture, politics - - with some scathing commentary on consumerism and capitalism - - and some digs at the ""Just Say No"" and ""Choose Life"" rallying cries.  I particularly liked the ending - - there were no sweeping revelations for the characters, they remained true to their weaknesses, true to their characters.There are plenty of sad, sick moments, and there are some very funny moments, even through the darkness, and the wit of each character is fantastic.  Some of the most imaginative sequences I enjoyed immensely, but felt as though they could've done without the extremism and still kept a good flowing story.  Still, they certainly made a strong point in the scene involving the most disgusting toilet in Scotland.  As for the dialogue, I am going to have to watch it again, just to make sure I caught it all.  My husband and I finally admitted we weren't understanding the dialogue as fully as we would've liked, so we switched to the ""hearing-impaired"" sub-titles about 30 minutes into the film.  The Scottish accents are the thickest!The acting is terrific, across the board.  I was shocked - - just flabbergasted! - - as the film ended and I saw Ewan McGregor was Mark Renton!  He looked so gaunt and ill, not the charming and handsome Ewan McGregor of 'Moulin Rouge'!Definitely not a movie for the kids, 'Trainspotting' is a film everyone should see once, even if the topic is unsettling.  Plus, I give it extra stars for utilizing my favorite descriptive noun - - ""wanker"".  I also appreciated the integration of Iggy Pop's song ""Lust for Life"", knowing that it was written after Iggy had kicked his heroin habit and had a newfound lust for life.  I'm just glad to hear that song used anywhere other than car commercials!",5,Deeper than a heroin addiction,1063670400,"09 16, 2003",2003,3231,"[""'d"", 'like', 'begin', 'review', 'pre-viewing', 'expectations', 'ZILCH', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'had', 'not', 'viewed', 'trailer', 'read', 'box', 'just', 'sat', 'down', 'sofa', 'husband', 'pressed', 'play', 'remote', 'jumped', 'right', 'feet', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'made', 'squirm', 'was', 'thinking', 'oh', 'movie', 'glorifying', 'drugs', 'lots', 'F-words', 'thick', 'accents', 'narration', 'main', 'character', 'Mark', 'Renton', 'was', 'intellectually', 'stimulating', 'listened', 'more', 'closely', 'allowed', 'become', 'immersed', 'story', 'characters', 'story', 'are', 'ugly', 'heroin-addicted', 'losers', 'are', 'portrayed', 'very', 'real', 'people', 'yes', 'are', 'bad', 'are', 'not', 'evil', 'lives', 'are', 'extremely', 'grim', 'repugnant', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wondered', 'how', 'people', 'addicted', 'heroin', 'can', 'live', 'lives', 'thinking', 'are', 'living', 'normally', 'addiction', 'so', 'powerful', 'powerless', 'live', 'other', 'way', 'then', 'realized', 'almost', 'anything', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'addiction', 'wrestle', 'something', 'be', 'weight', 'ethics', 'punctuality', 'etc..', 'Moments', 'when', 'convince', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'time', 'next', 'time.The', 'film', 'interesting', 'comparisons', 'normal', 'life', 'twisted', 'lives', 'characters', 'notice', 'small', 'hypocrisies', 'such', 'friend', 'pub', 'railing', 'drug', 'use', 'obviously', 'alcohol', 'anger-management', 'problem', 'film', 'also', 'issues', 'loyalty', 'culture', 'politics', 'scathing', 'commentary', 'consumerism', 'capitalism', 'digs', 'Just', 'Say', 'No', 'Choose', 'Life', 'rallying', 'cries', 'particularly', 'liked', 'ending', 'were', 'sweeping', 'revelations', 'characters', 'remained', 'true', 'weaknesses', 'true', 'characters.There', 'are', 'plenty', 'sad', 'sick', 'moments', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'even', 'darkness', 'wit', 'character', 'fantastic', 'most', 'imaginative', 'sequences', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'felt', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'extremism', 'still', 'kept', 'good', 'flowing', 'story', 'Still', 'certainly', 'made', 'strong', 'point', 'scene', 'involving', 'most', 'disgusting', 'toilet', 'Scotland', 'dialogue', 'am', 'going', 'have', 'watch', 'again', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'caught', 'husband', 'finally', 'admitted', 'were', ""n't"", 'understanding', 'dialogue', 'as', 'fully', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'switched', 'hearing-impaired', 'sub-titles', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'Scottish', 'accents', 'are', 'thickest', 'acting', 'terrific', 'board', 'was', 'shocked', 'just', 'flabbergasted', 'film', 'ended', 'saw', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'was', 'Mark', 'Renton', 'looked', 'so', 'gaunt', 'ill', 'not', 'charming', 'handsome', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', ""'Moulin"", 'Rouge', 'Definitely', 'not', 'movie', 'kids', ""'Trainspotting"", 'film', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'once', 'even', 'topic', 'unsettling', 'give', 'extra', 'stars', 'utilizing', 'favorite', 'descriptive', 'noun', 'wanker', 'also', 'appreciated', 'integration', 'Iggy', 'Pop', 'song', 'Lust', 'Life', 'knowing', 'was', 'written', 'Iggy', 'had', 'kicked', 'heroin', 'habit', 'had', 'newfound', 'lust', 'life', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'hear', 'song', 'used', 'anywhere', 'other', 'car', 'commercials']",Trainspotting VHS

""Trainspotting,"" an uncompromising look into the lives of heroin addicts, is not for those with weak stomachs, or weak minds for that matter.  Is it anti-drug or pro-drug?  I don't know, but it sure turned me off from ever trying heroin.Ewan McGregor's breakthrough role as Renton made him a star.  In this film, he is the dirtiest, skinniest, and most unattractive I have ever seen him.  But he's very good anyway.  He plays a young man with no ideals (until later) except having a good hit.  It's disturbing to watch what happens as he struggles to stay clean.This is not a pretty picture.  This movie is sad, disgusting, and doesn't allow for sympathy for any characters except Renton only occasionally.  But it's engrossing.  You might be so appauled by what you see that you keep watching.  You might know someone who is a drug addict who struggles like these guys do and feel what they're going through in some fashion.  Or you might turn away from drugs altogether once you see the extreme of consequences.Warning: You may hate this movie.  You may be offended.  If you are, I won't think less of you.

I did not get a chance to see it but there was a lot of press about Trainspotting mania in the UK.  When the film came out I wanted to see it but found out it was about drugs and became leery of it.  Since it got great reviews, I went and saw it and was surprised.  It was my favorite film of the year!The film deals with four friends that are caught up in the Scottish drug culture.  The hero of the film is Renton (Ewan McGregor).  His best friends are Sick boy, Begbie, Tommy and Spud.  All but Tommy are heroine addicts.  Renton decides to go cold turkey.  But before cold turkey, one last hit.  (This leads to one of the most disgusting yet intriguing fantasy sequences.)  Renton finds it hard to stay clean and slips.  He gets caught stealing and is forced to enter rehab.  Afterwards, he gets a reality check from his underage girlfriend.  He realizes that he cannot live this life forever.Renton decides he needs to break away from his crew and moves to London for a fresh start.  But Begbie shows up then Sick Boy.  This is hampering his sobriety and kicks them out.  But the boys have to return home for a mate's funeral and there luck into a big score.  They return to London to sell their score.I generally hate films that are narrated but it works here.  Even more, I hate movies that in any way glamorize drugs but this really doesn't, even the fantasy sequences are not glamorous.  This is just a great look at the subculture.This is one of director's Danny Boyle's first films and he creates near perfection.  The only actor with any true film background is Robert ""The Full Monty"" Carlisle but everyone is universally great.

413863,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,6304297912,Mr. Cairene,"[5, 6]","Trainspotting is a film completely lacking in moral fibre and is all the better for it. As many critics waited for that scene where our hero(or anti-hero) regrets his sins, the scene of redemption, a scene that never  came, they decided the film was morally corrupt.In fact Trainspotting  never flinches when showing the sometimes harrowing effects of addiction  (the fate of the baby and Tommy come to mind). The fact that the characters  in the film remain unrepentant inspite of that speaks more to their  character then any positive aspects of drugs.These characters  represent anarchy, nihilism and a lust for life, things we all love to  watch, yet hipocritically like to take the moral highground by requiring  these character to suffer in agony for their way of life. Trainspotting in  too original and yes too realistic to take that route. If you are offended  by the lack of moral redemption in movies like Trainspotting and Figh Club,  ask yourself this question: Why did you enjoy the anarchy in the beginning?Renton is a person that none of us would like to be around, but he is  undoubtly exhilerating to watch. Like the lead character in GOODFELLAS  Henry Hill, he is unrepentant by the end of the movie. But as Roger Ebert  observed about Hill &quot;his only regret at the end of the movie is that  he had no more soul to sell.&quot; Renton on the other hand &quot;chooses  life&quot; as a practical measure, a calculated descion to lead a more  trouble free life, not a moral one.The film as a whole is like a bolt  of lightening, a shot of adrenaline. I promise that you won't shift in your  seat once before the end-credits. Director Danny Boyle's visual imagination  is unending, some scenes manage to be puke-worthy disgusting and  bone-achingly funny at the same time.Come to think about it,  Trainspotting could have had a hero who has a conscience, who loves his  girlfriend, who fears his parents, who is loyal to his friends.

Lukacs ""Simbob""","[2, 2]","The trio of producer Andrew McDonald, writer John Hodge and director Danny Boyle had had pretty good critical and reasonable commercial success with their debut feature Shallow Grave, but no one expected what was coming next. Out of the shadows, came a film about heroin addicts in Scotland that surely wouldn't be a success, would it?Trainspottings rise to cult status was a remarkable one. After all, it did not seem to have the automatic ingredients of a runaway hit. It may not have made a huge impact in the States, but in Britain it took the nation by storm. Everyone knew the name, the poster, probably some of the dialogue, even if they hadn't seen the film, and if you hadn't you felt like you were missing out on something special! In terms of a culture shift, there has been no more important film in the last 15 years. It relaunched British interest in Lou Reed and Iggy Pop, spawned countless imitators, and propelled six young actors into the limelight who will always be known for their roles in the film. It was also the platform for Ewan McGregor and Robert Carlysle to take on Hollywood. Believe me, if it wasn't for Trainspotting, someone else would have played Obi Wan in Phantom Menace and the villain in the World is Not Enough.So what makes this film so special. Great performances, cool soundtrack, sharp dialogue, a storyline that is as harrowing as it is funny. It really just captured the mood of a nation, and showed drug use with brutal honesty, not with glamour or with unneccesary preaching. Perhaps thats why it caused such a furore, not because it dared to state an opinion, because it dared not to. The truth is a dangerous thing.Being British in 1996 and seeing this was a very special thing, but it is still a magnificent film for any audience that withstands repeated viewings.

413867,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,6304297912,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[3, 3]","This breakthrough film from director Danny Boyle (The Beach, 28 Days Later) was an international hit that deserves all the critical acclaim it garnered and helped launch the career of actor Ewan McGregor. Adapted from the acclaimed novel by Irvine Welsh, Trainspotting tells the story of Renton (McGregor), Spud (Ewen Bremner), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller), and Tommy (Kevin McKidd); four Scottish heroin addicts in the wake of &quot;choosing life, or choosing not to choose life&quot;. Director Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge manage to transfer what is an unfilmable book to film thanks to the off the wall hyperkinetic humor and the brilliant cast. Robert Carlyle's performance as the fight provoking, hard drinking Begbie is excellent as he goes from humerous to frightening in the snap of a finger. While Trainspotting isn't an ode to heroin, it is not a warning about the drug or drugs in general period. The film sucessfully presents all the otherworldly pleasure and excruciating pain that goes with addiction, and like the later made Requiem for a Dream, this is a film that can be hard to watch and is definitely not for everyone. As a previous reviewer stated, it's your choice.

413872,AXV9GS0TMSVW,6304297912,Poor Napoleon,"[0, 0]","Trainspotting is far varied from the usual drug movies that preceded it.  Along with Requiem for a Dream, Trainspotting was a shift from the casual use of drugs sans the consequences to a far darker tale.  While Requiem for a Dream was clearly an anti addiction tale, Trainspotting uses heroin as catalyst.  It isn't an anti drug movie per se.  Rather, it's a story of a group of friends who happen to use drugs.The film lifts its material from the book of the same name.  While it's a very different take, excising a lot of the book's material, the spirit is the same.  Notably, it is accurate juxtaposition of Irvine Welsh's stream of consciousness writing, using Renton as the chief protagonist.  While much of the film deals with Renton's heroin usage, we go along with Renton as he hangs out with Sick Boy, readies Spud for a job interview, shoplifts, goes clubbing, gets a job, etc. When he's not interacting with his mates, he's thinking about them.The film doesn't take a moral stance on drugs, but does show how it is the thing that brings Renton and his mates together and at the same time ruins their friendship.  But it's a combination of factors.  The film has a subtle repeated phrase where Renton or one of the others mutters about another that ""he's a mate,"" sticking by each other in spite of it all.  The film makes one ask, what will be the straw that breaks the camel's back?Aside from a brilliant screenplay, the film boasts one of the best ensemble casts.  While known for making Ewan MacGregor a recognizeable face, it also features the talented Johnny Lee Miller as the James Bond obsessed Sick Boy as well as the infallable Robert Carlyle as the sadistic Begbie.  The combination of music and very inspired shots, including the now infamous scene where Renton overdoses, makes the film alone worth watching.The DVD features the international cut, without the annoying dubbing of the first US release and a few seconds of film restored.  It also ports over the Criterion laserdisc extras, including a wonderful commentary featuring Ewan, Danny Boyle, and John Hodge.  In addition, there's some newly included production vignettes and, to me what is still the best feature, a number of deleted scenes - which further portray the destruction of the people in Renton's life, including a legless Swanney and a much colder cynical Sick Boy.

Youth is a stage that is fraught with danger in testing the waters, and rites of passage, a stage that in modern western culture has no prearranged stage or ceremony.Neither are there role models nor family. The parents are out to lunch although they do their best- who doesn't? Volatile, sensitive Youth is for all practical purposes alone, dangerously alone, with no boundaries or self-control. Renton, our hero, does heroin. His unsavory pal does liquor and people. Self-afflicted damage vs damage to others is an under current theme of Trainspotting. Money is everywhere, as are drugs, those of discontent housewives, and those found in bars, as well as illegal ones. Self-medication is rampant, stylized (not glorified) in the film.Brilliant color schemes and set design hark back to Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange yet add something new and different. Neglect of youth is generational and a threat to young life and society. Theme is brilliantly expressed via the superb acting of Ewan MacGregor and all the others. Nothing is left to chance, no detail too unimportant to convey, in the brilliant directing work of Danny Boyle.The editing conveys the restless pace of angst-ridden young heroin addicts, along with the brilliantly selected score by Bowie and Iggy Pop, and Lou Reed, among others. In the opening scene alone, all the elements of film work together to present theme and introduce characters: Renton colliding with a moving car, grinning with bold mischief when he realizes he has triumphed over death; Sick Boy and Alison swooning with ectasy when they shoot up, the gaudily colored set vs the reality of the shabby drug house and neglected baby of young parents who are too busy trying to escape from reality to care for the one they love the most.All is incredibly and expertly choreographed to Bowie's and Iggy Pop's title track. Even the voice-over narration by Renton works remarkably well, a feat in and of itself, given the sorry track record of most film narrations. This is a tragic story, and far from ""glorifies"" hard drug abuse. It is also rich with blackly humorous dialogue, acting and camera work- the ""worst bathroom in Scotland ""scene, for instance. The film is visually stunning, poetically inspiring and meticulously directed.

I gave it 2 stars because it has some uniquely creative aspects to it, but I do not care for the basic style it was made in. The film flaunts it's comic book style absurdity. I would have really enjoyed this film if was told in a serious and realistic manner similar to that of other drug films like Christiane F., which in my opinion is probably the best film about heroin addicts ever made. But generally speaking I really don't care for films that take the serious issues and make them into fantasies. You know- the mannerisms of the story and filming technique that are there to get noticed for their flashy artistry. This is the same reason I hated 'Requiem for a dream'. The film had such a powerful story to tell, so why muck it up with a bunch of silly artistic flashiness? For me this style of film making rarely works. Even Oliver Stone managed to annoy me with some of 'Natural Born Killers', which I did like very much. And I love his films for the most part. Stone did well with artistic imagery in that film and 'The Doors', which I loved. But there is a wackiness to the style of film making here that is similar to a few of Terry Gilliam's movies that I really don't like much. I didn't care for really any of his films either primarily due to this ""fantasy"" style of film making that is used in films with primarily serious subject matter. So far I have absolutely hated nearly every movie Danny Boyle has made except for 127 hours. I much prefer films that have a flair of psychedelia that were made in the 60's or 70's if they are going to be that way. Boyle's style annoys the crap out of me. it's the very thing that ruined Slumdog Millionaire for me. It remains the worst best picture Oscar winner I have ever seen.

413876,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6304297912,Randy Keehn,"[1, 1]","I had taken notice of ""Trainspotting"" in the ""NY Times Best 1000 Movies"".  I got an idea that it was a bit rough from what I'd seen of reviews.  I have a personal bias against movies that go out of their way to be graphic and/or obscene.  Thus I was not sure how I would react to what I thought I would see.  I will say that ""Trainspotting"" is not a movie for everyone, it should be respected for its' ""R"" rating, and it is one heck of a movie.  ""Trainspotting"" will shock you with its' violence, its' view of a dead end society, the close-up examination of heroin addiction, and some of the grossest scenes I've ever seen in a movie of this quality.  Nonetheless, the movie is not guilty of any excesses except in the subject matter itself.Not long ago, I had the pleasure to watch ""The Full Monty"" which has a greater renown than ""Trainspotting"" and deals as well with the subject of the down and out in urban Great Britain.  That movie let us have fun while coming to understand a stagnant society that offered little hope of change to its' citizens.  I will admit that, although I rarely laugh out loud when I'm watching a movie by myself, there is one grossly hilarious scene in ""Trainspotting"" that had me laughing boisterously out loud.  Other than that, humor is not a part of this film.  It deals with an alternate solution to hopelessness; narcotic addiction.  It portrays addiction in a very negative manner while dealing with its' victims in a very humanely manner.  These people may scare us, repulse us and, possibly, disgust us but we generally are pulling for them to find a way out.I caught myself, midway through the movie, thinking that ""Trainspotting"" should be required viewing for anyone contemplating using heroin or any addictive drugs.  It paints a bleak picture and does so with the excesses that it takes.  There is a brilliantly disgusting scene in the worst of all possible toilets in the back of some dive.  It may turn your stomach but what you see happening there says so clearly the depravity an addict will sink to.  There are scenes that give an excellent visual concept to the withdrawals that an addict must go through to get clean again.  There are slaps of reality that let us know that there is never any complete escape from the real world.  As I saw scene after scene that stung my senses and sensitivity, I could not help but marvel at the ability of the writer and director; Irving Welsh and Danny Boyle.  Unlike ""Naked Lunch"", a movie that disgusted me for no apparent reason, ""Trainspotting"" tells a story that could only be understood this well by the approach that Welsh and Boyle took.""Trainspotting"" is not just a negative view of the underground world of the addict; it takes its' shots at polite society as well.

The problem is there's so many things surrounding the drug issue I just don't know what to think of the film. Is Trainspotting a bit too glossy, too movie-like? In some ways it is... the characters are funny, and larger than life, easily able to get through 90% of their troubles even when these things could be profound issues in real life. There's barely a trace of existential despair. For the most part these anti-heroes are just self indulgent party guys, that create their own gritty, destructive life. You don't get the sense of any of them being alienated from families or social support. If they're supposed to be the genuine ghettoized, they don't come across as it other than behavioral problems they choose to have.However, if you get past the fact that making a movie about drugs is hard as hell because you'll either come across as too cautionary or too glamorous, then Trainspotting is very witty, slick movie. In the end it doesn't make any final calls about drugs or morality, which is how it does manage to stay somewhat out of the realm of criticism, but at the same time it's slightly disappointing. Don't we watch movies to see what they can reveal about the center of human behavior?

413883,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6304297912,Reviewer,"[1, 2]","The effect of heroin addiction on a young man and his closest friends is explored in the hard-hitting drama, ""Trainspotting,"" directed by Danny Boyle.  Set in Scotland, Ewan McGregor stars as Renton, a young man to whom drugs have become a way of life; in fact, more than a ""way of"" life, they have ""become"" his life.  And a more filthy, degrading lifestyle one would be hard put to imagine.  Renton has arrived at a point wherein absolutely nothing means anything to him:  Family, friends, job, nothing.  All that matters is the next fix.  And to get it, he will do whatever it takes, including robbing, stealing or even betraying his mates.  It's a hard life, but to ""Rents"" the high-- even with the total loss of self esteem-- makes it all worth it; and he'll get it any way he can:  Snorting, shooting up or using suppositories.  Eventually, however, Renton's bad life gets even worse, and as he emerges on morning from has drug-induced haze, he realizes things are going to have to change.  The question is, can he do it?  Or will he even want to.  The film is a hard look at the depths to which an addict will descend and what one will do to get that fix.  To illustrate the point, there is one graphic scene (almost too hard to watch), in which Renton, losing a couple of suppositories (they had yet to melt) through a sudden act of nature, proceeds upon realizing it to turn around and fish for them in the ""filthiest toilet in Scotland.""  The scene is almost unbearable, but what an example of what it means to be in thrall to drugs.  In another scene, not quite as graphic but powerful nonetheless, Renton's parents lock him in his room and he is forced to go ""cold turkey.""  And although, after the aforementioned scene this is a bit easier to watch, it is still unpleasant, but delivers a succinct message about the nature of drug addiction.  McGregor is well cast as Renton, as he brings a clean-cut look to the part that seems so contradictory to the lifestyle embraced by the character.  The perfect choice of all the characters through which to tell the story, Renton has a look and an attitude that convey a life that holds such promise; here is a lad with a future.  And therein lies a message in itself:  When drugs are involved, never judge a book by it's cover, for addiction is never discerning.  Most importantly, McGregor's performance is believable and he has a charismatic screen presence that makes Renton someone with whom the audience will readily be able to identify, which is necessary for the film to work.  Without that connection, much of the message of this film would be lost, but thanks to McGregor, as well as some bold moments courtesy of director Boyle, it is not.  The supporting cast includes Ewen Bremmer (Spud), Jonny Lee Miller (Sick Boy), Kevin McKidd (Tommy), Robert Carlyle (Begbie), Kelly Macdonald (Diane) and Peter Mullan (Swanney).  One of the best anti-drug films in memory, ""Trainspotting"" will affect even the most jaded abuser of controlled substances, for it puts the situation into perspective and gives it context, while keeping it at (still an uncomfortable) arm's length.  It may be tough to watch, but there are lessons to be learned from it that are invaluable.  A great companion feature to the more recent ""Traffic,"" this is a film that will no doubt have a dramatic affect on those who see it, for the images it presents will not easily be forgotten. And if this film will save even one person from learning about drugs the hard way, then it will have made the endeavor entirely worthwhile.

'Trainspotting' puts the viewer right inside the minds and lives of heroin addicted people, and it's not pretty. When we first meet our main character and narrator Renton (played with sheer brilliance by Ewan McGregor), he gets hit by a car, gets up, and laughs. Next thing we know, he's passed out on the ground in a hellhole known as Mother Superior's, a needle sticking in his arm. He introduces his other friends - most of them also drug users. There's Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), obsessed with James Bond, Spud (Ewen Bremmer), Tommy (Kevin McKidd), and the violently tempered Begbie (manically portrayed by Robert Carlyle). All of them have their obsessions and for Renton it's heroin. For me, this film has two parts. The first one is darkly funny (this part includes the infamous 'worst toliet in Scotland' scene, viewers with weak stomachs beware). The second (which begins around the time the baby dies) is intense, especially the detox scene. The film never flinches away from showing the viewer what these peoples lives are like. The apartments are rotting away, the people have no jobs, all they have is heroin and each other. There is nonstop language, stong sexual content including nudity, not to mention graphic herion use. The film is not for everyone, in fact I've found it's for very little. I happen to find every manic, funny, intense moment of this film entertaining. Others have found it depressing, weird, or just plain sick. So tread carefully. However, it's an important film and one that deserves to be seen.

Renton tries more than once to rid himself of the white horse on his back, but finds that being sucked back in is easier than fighting the horse.This is a movie about people and personalities, not one particular event, though several of these everyday occurrences will stand out in your mind forever - Like the world's filthiest toilet that Renton is forced to use, and his toilet daydream that follows it.  There's an unforgettable scat scene with morning sheets that will be sure to turn your stomach.Warning:  There is a dead baby scene in this movie that will turn most stomachs and perhaps make you hate every heroin addict that ever lived.  Though nothing is ever said about it, the insinuation is that the baby died from neglect.  Before even reporting it, the mother needs a ""hit"" to calm her down.Set to a great soundtrack and filled with witty dialogue (although absolutely filled with flagrant curses) and narrative, 'Trainspotting' highlights not just the differences between ""Us And Them"" but the differences between the addicts themselves.  The most violent of the addicts, Begbie, never touches heroin and considers it to be filth while swilling alcohol and stabbing people.  Spud is simply confused all the time, while Tommy manages to steer clear of the horse until his girlfriend dumps him.If you're a fan of the addiction movie, then this is a must-see.  If you can't handle horrific scenes, such as the dead baby scene, then perhaps pass on this.

The film takes several non-trivial gambles in handling pithy social themes: social junkies in the throes of drugs' harrows, AIDS, crib death, personal betrayal etc.Yet, the film is not a deadbeat documentary. With its  tongue firmly planted in one cheek, it employs glorious wit and a razor sharp narrative to drive home other points. For instance, ironically, the movie's most pathologically twisted character is not a substance abuser but an alcoholic who never touches drugs.The thick Scottish accent lends that mildly comic cadence to the affair, and this is where the subtitles come in handy.

Trainspotting is easily one of the best movies I've ever seen.  It's hilarious for one, unavoidably engaging in its entirety, and graphically disturbing.  It's black and white masterfully intertwined.  An excellent source of introspection and social comparison, these are several aspects a free-thinking, cannabis connaisseur such as myself thoroughly enjoys each time I view it.  I mean it's hard not to, heroin injection is disgusting and it should make you cringe and feel uncomfortable, which in turn further activates your mind.  Danny Boyle and the film crew's biggest success is how in the end they neither glorified nor condemned the 'wonderful world that is heroin addiction'.  They simply paint the lifestyle for what it is and leave the viewer to formulate their own thoughts, which is what this ride is all about.  It's not about reading someone else's books and pawning off their sayings as your own, it's about freeing your mind and thinking for yourself.

""Pop Culture Addict""","[1, 7]","Danny Boyle's ""Trainspotting"" is a film that chronicles the disorientation and bewilderment typically experienced by drug users.  It attempts to get its point across by having the viewer experience visually what the abuser is experiencing firsthand.  It does its job too well though as the end product is a disjointed and rambling mess.Renton (Ewan McGregor), Spud (Ewen Bremner), Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), Tommy (Kevin McKidd), and Begbie (Robert Carlyle) all lead empty lives and pass the time by getting high.  Their daily routines consist of activities that are neither meaningful nor substantial.  Then one day, Renton decides to join the real world by kicking his habit and becoming a rental agent.  However, he cannot completely escape his past and soon finds himself mixed up in a drug deal.There are moments in ""Trainspotting"" that rekindle memories of Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" but these moments are fleeting and in short supply.  The entire film is just a succession of disturbing images that have no cohesiveness to them when assembled.  While this fragmented narrative ably symbolizes the chaotic and unfocused experiences of the addict, it makes for a frustrating viewing experience.  The acting is fine with McGregor and Carlyle giving standout performances, but this is about all the film has going for it.  The life of a drug user is a one-trip to nowhere.

Its portrayal of a motley crew of heroin addicts and sociopaths is done with an impeccable eye for direction  and is effectively chilling. The film does not glamorize the use of drugs  in any fashion, though criminals might mistake the film as a paean to their  lifestyle. No judgments are made here: the demented world of these  characters is placed before the viewer with all of its consequences. The  squalor and decay of addiction is evident throughout the film.  What  stands out are the performances. Ewan McGregor is spectacular in his  character's willful helplessness against heroin addiction. He is  spine-tingling in his complacency, his moral indifference. Robert Carlyle  is frightening as the psychotic Begbe; his versatility as an actor is on  fine display, especially compared with his roles in Priest and The Full  Monty. The rest of the cast does an exquisite job of portraying the utter  meaninglessness that becomes part and parcel of the heroin-addicted life.  The film has its intense and revolting moments--the toilet scene is not for  a weak stomach and the 'cold turkey' scene, complete with dead baby  crawling along the ceiling, is also disturbing. However, if the viewer is  open to a hard-hitting dose of reality with an ensemble of unlikeable but  well-portrayed characterizations, Trainspotting will please.

Having been in Scotland many times, and known young men of this age, I found this grim portrait all the more frightening and heartbreaking. They are essentially beautiful young men (some of them, anyway) who are casually and uncaringly dying while injecting themselves unflinchingly with heroine.No part of the heroine experience is hidden from the viewer, and I advise those who don't want to share the experience to avoid this movie. For the hovels, toilets, dingy bars, and alleys where these mates shoot up, and the close-up of the bloody needles, the mixing of the drug, and every other horror, is unrelenting. Add in the fear of AIDS, some hopelessly mindless and unfulfilling sex, a dead baby, real and hallucinated, and you have some idea of the nature of this film.So what makes it so brilliant? Everything. From the acting of Ewan MacGregor et al. to the spare script, to the photography, to every last detail, this is the quintessential picture of despair in the true noir sense.

413915,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,6304297912,Wheelchair Assassin,"[25, 26]","Its setting and subject matter were somewhat grim to put it mildly, but that didn't stop Trainspotting from becoming one of the top movies of the nineties, and having just watched it this morning I can safely state that it holds up well to this day.  While I haven't read the Irvine Welsh novel on which this movie is based, I have read some of his other work, and the movie is a perfect distillation of his storytelling style-rapid-fire, filled with bawdy set pieces, characters living on the edge of acceptable society, and lots and lots of swears.  It's also the kind of violent, genre-defying, and pop culture reference-laden movie, complete with way-cool soundtrack, that emerged with such force in the nineties and spawned so many imitations in this decade.  For my money at least, this movie is a much more entertaining and convincing look at the world of heroin users than the interesting, but annoyingly depressing and pedantic, Requiem for a Dream, which came out a few years later to almost hyperbolic praise.  Trainspotting is a blunt, unapologetic look a life most of us can scarcely imagine, delivered with a combination of hilarity and horror that effortlessly intertwines these two extremes.  It doesn't shrink from depicting the damage caused by heroin addiction, but it doesn't downplay all the fun of it either, which is what lends it so much of its gritty believability.Trainspotting also marked the arrival on the international scene of director Danny Boyle, whose manic visual style would later serve him well on the slightly-less-brilliant 28 Days Later.  Perhaps most impressively, it manages to contain one of my all-time top ten movie lines (""Who needs reasons when you've got heroin?""), my favorite nickname ever, fictional or otherwise (""We called him Mother Superior on account of the length of his habit""-brilliant), and more ""Oh my God, did I just see that?"" images than you'll find in fifty Hollywood blockbusters.  In Boyle's hands the crazy imagery practically flies off the screen, be it human waste flying from a sheet across a room, the movie's protagonist climbing into Scotland's filthiest toilet to retrieve something he lost, or the hallucinatory, nightmarish haze of a cold-turkey withdrawal.  The unrestrained depictions of sex, nudity, violence, drug use, and bodily functions make this a movie not to be viewed by the squeamish, but they perfectly suit its unflinching examination of the sordid goings-on in one country's drug-laden urban culture.The action is filtered through the point of view of the movie's narrator, Mark Renton, a cynical but insightful twentysomething travelling through a nihilistic culture of nightclubs and drug dens without many concerns beyond getting his next fix because, well, all other concerns seem petty and inconsequential by comparison.  Although I don't use drugs (well, the ones arbitrarily declared illegal anyway), it's not exactly hard to understand Renton's reasons-in a world as numbing as the one that surrounds him, the ephemeral rush of a heroin high is more tangible and true than most of what people use to distract themselves from their unfulfilling lives.  Really, that's what the movie's about-the relentless pursuit of that elusive and nebulous concept known as happiness.  Renton's not that bad a guy; he mostly just wants to score some drugs and sex and listen to some Iggy Pop, and if his lifestyle causes anyone else (i.e., his parents) to suffer, well, that's just an unfortunate byproduct.  Besides, it's not like he's missing that much: the Scotland of Trainspotting is a rather depressing land of dingy, Detroit-esque post-industrial decay, and even the natural beauty of the local highlands isn't enough to overcome the cynicism that's overtaken Renton and most of his friends.  Viewed against this backdrop, it's easy to ask whether the straight life is even worth it.Although Ewan MacGregor plays Renton in career-making fashion (too bad he spent all that time on those mediocre Star Wars prequels), Robert Carlyle delivers the most immediately enjoyable performance as the menacing Begbie, an unhinged, beer-swilling psychopath who looks at heroin users with contempt but has no problem cutting a swath of destruction through any bar where someone crosses him, intentionally or not.  Even though (or perhaps because) he's so violent and unpredictable, Begbie gives the movie a sort of bizarre comic relief through the sheer force of his twisted personality alone.  Even though I wouldn't get within fifty feet of the guy, I couldn't help but enjoy watching him, especially with Carlyle turning in such a likably maniacal performance.Besides, in addition to what I've written above, how can you not like a movie that features a shot of a dead baby crawling along a ceiling and rotating its head 180 degrees?  If that doesn't scream fun for the whole family, I don't know what does.",5,Classic,1154217600,"07 30, 2006",2006,4889,"['setting', 'subject', 'matter', 'were', 'somewhat', 'grim', 'put', 'mildly', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Trainspotting', 'becoming', 'one', 'top', 'movies', 'nineties', 'having', 'just', 'watched', 'morning', 'can', 'safely', 'state', 'up', 'well', 'day', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Irvine', 'Welsh', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', 'have', 'read', 'other', 'work', 'movie', 'perfect', 'distillation', 'storytelling', 'style-rapid-fire', 'filled', 'bawdy', 'set', 'pieces', 'characters', 'living', 'edge', 'acceptable', 'society', 'lots', 'lots', 'swears', 'also', 'kind', 'violent', 'genre-defying', 'pop', 'culture', 'reference-laden', 'movie', 'complete', 'way-cool', 'soundtrack', 'emerged', 'such', 'force', 'nineties', 'spawned', 'so', 'many', 'imitations', 'decade', 'money', 'least', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'convincing', 'look', 'world', 'heroin', 'users', 'interesting', 'annoyingly', 'depressing', 'pedantic', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'came', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'almost', 'hyperbolic', 'praise', 'Trainspotting', 'blunt', 'unapologetic', 'look', 'life', 'most', 'can', 'scarcely', 'imagine', 'delivered', 'combination', 'hilarity', 'horror', 'effortlessly', 'two', 'extremes', ""n't"", 'shrink', 'depicting', 'damage', 'caused', 'heroin', 'addiction', ""n't"", 'downplay', 'fun', 'what', 'so', 'much', 'gritty', 'believability.Trainspotting', 'also', 'marked', 'arrival', 'international', 'scene', 'director', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'manic', 'visual', 'style', 'would', 'later', 'serve', 'well', 'slightly-less-brilliant', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'impressively', 'contain', 'one', 'all-time', 'top', 'ten', 'movie', 'lines', 'Who', 'reasons', 'when', ""'ve"", 'got', 'heroin', 'favorite', 'nickname', 'ever', 'fictional', 'otherwise', 'called', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'account', 'length', 'habit', '-brilliant', 'more', 'Oh', 'God', 'did', 'just', 'see', ""'ll"", 'find', 'fifty', 'Hollywood', 'blockbusters', 'Boyle', 'crazy', 'imagery', 'practically', 'screen', 'be', 'human', 'waste', 'flying', 'sheet', 'room', 'movie', 'protagonist', 'climbing', 'Scotland', 'filthiest', 'toilet', 'retrieve', 'something', 'lost', 'hallucinatory', 'nightmarish', 'haze', 'cold-turkey', 'withdrawal', 'unrestrained', 'depictions', 'sex', 'nudity', 'violence', 'drug', 'use', 'bodily', 'functions', 'make', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'viewed', 'squeamish', 'perfectly', 'suit', 'unflinching', 'examination', 'sordid', 'goings-on', 'one', 'country', 'drug-laden', 'urban', 'culture.The', 'action', 'filtered', 'point', 'view', 'movie', 'narrator', 'Mark', 'Renton', 'cynical', 'insightful', 'twentysomething', 'travelling', 'nihilistic', 'culture', 'nightclubs', 'drug', 'dens', 'many', 'concerns', 'getting', 'next', 'fix', 'well', 'other', 'concerns', 'seem', 'petty', 'inconsequential', 'comparison', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'drugs', 'well', 'ones', 'arbitrarily', 'declared', 'illegal', 'anyway', 'not', 'exactly', 'hard', 'understand', 'Renton', 'reasons-in', 'world', 'as', 'numbing', 'one', 'ephemeral', 'rush', 'heroin', 'high', 'more', 'tangible', 'true', 'most', 'what', 'people', 'use', 'distract', 'unfulfilling', 'lives', 'Really', 'what', 'movie', 'about-the', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'elusive', 'nebulous', 'concept', 'known', 'happiness', 'Renton', 'not', 'bad', 'guy', 'mostly', 'just', 'score', 'drugs', 'sex', 'listen', 'Iggy', 'Pop', 'lifestyle', 'anyone', 'else', 'i.e.', 'parents', 'suffer', 'well', 'just', 'unfortunate', 'byproduct', 'not', 'missing', 'much', 'Scotland', 'Trainspotting', 'rather', 'depressing', 'land', 'dingy', 'Detroit-esque', 'post-industrial', 'decay', 'even', 'natural', 'beauty', 'local', 'highlands', ""n't"", 'enough', 'overcome', 'cynicism', 'overtaken', 'Renton', 'most', 'friends', 'Viewed', 'backdrop', 'easy', 'ask', 'straight', 'life', 'even', 'worth', 'Ewan', 'MacGregor', 'Renton', 'career-making', 'fashion', 'too', 'bad', 'spent', 'time', 'mediocre', 'Star', 'Wars', 'prequels', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'most', 'immediately', 'enjoyable', 'performance', 'menacing', 'Begbie', 'unhinged', 'beer-swilling', 'psychopath', 'who', 'heroin', 'users', 'contempt', 'problem', 'cutting', 'swath', 'destruction', 'bar', 'where', 'someone', 'intentionally', 'not', 'Even', 'perhaps', 'so', 'violent', 'unpredictable', 'Begbie', 'movie', 'sort', 'bizarre', 'comic', 'relief', 'sheer', 'force', 'twisted', 'personality', 'alone', 'Even', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'fifty', 'feet', 'guy', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'especially', 'Carlyle', 'turning', 'such', 'likably', 'maniacal', 'performance.Besides', 'addition', 'what', ""'ve"", 'written', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'movie', 'shot', 'dead', 'baby', 'crawling', 'ceiling', 'rotating', 'head', '180', 'degrees', ""n't"", 'scream', 'fun', 'whole', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what']",Trainspotting VHS

Theres nothing I can say that will explain the greatness of this film. It is pobably the film I reach for most often when I put a dvd in. If you like films that explore the seedy underbelly of society than you will love this. It is loaded with disturbing drugged out dispair. However it is also one of the funniest films I have ever seen. If you dont laugh at the scene where francis begby randomly lobbs that empty beer stein over his shoulder and it splits that ladys face wide open just so he could get into a fight, than you must not have a twisted bone in your body. This film also has a very serious nature to it as well. Rentons attempts to ween himself from smack will make anybody think twice about sliding that syringe int your veins.That being said this is not just your usual ""drugs are evil"" movie. Trainspotting also holds no bars about the reason people do drugs.  ""Take the best orgasm youve ever had and multiply it by a thousand and your still nowhere near it""-Renton. That pretty much explains it all. However in order to experiance the sheer brilliance you have to see this movie yourself.",5,The best movie ever,1139616000,"02 11, 2006",2006,1153,"['could', 'make', 'long', 'review', 'wont', 'nothing', 'can', 'say', 'will', 'explain', 'greatness', 'film', 'pobably', 'film', 'reach', 'most', 'often', 'when', 'put', 'dvd', 'like', 'films', 'explore', 'seedy', 'underbelly', 'society', 'will', 'love', 'loaded', 'disturbing', 'drugged', 'out', 'dispair', 'However', 'also', 'one', 'funniest', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'dont', 'laugh', 'scene', 'where', 'francis', 'begby', 'randomly', 'empty', 'beer', 'stein', 'shoulder', 'ladys', 'face', 'wide', 'open', 'just', 'so', 'could', 'get', 'fight', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'twisted', 'bone', 'body', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'serious', 'nature', 'as', 'well', 'Rentons', 'attempts', 'ween', 'smack', 'will', 'make', 'anybody', 'think', 'twice', 'about', 'sliding', 'syringe', 'int', 'veins.That', 'being', 'said', 'not', 'just', 'usual', 'drugs', 'are', 'evil', 'movie', 'Trainspotting', 'also', 'bars', 'reason', 'people', 'do', 'drugs', 'Take', 'best', 'orgasm', 'youve', 'ever', 'had', 'multiply', 'thousand', 'still', 'nowhere', '-Renton', 'pretty', 'much', 'However', 'order', 'experiance', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'have', 'see', 'movie']",Trainspotting VHS
