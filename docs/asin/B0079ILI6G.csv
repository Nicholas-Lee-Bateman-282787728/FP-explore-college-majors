I love this series and it's sad the it only lasted 2 seasons, but at least they were 2 action packed and filled to the brim seasons.  Plenty of great stories were told and a lot was covered.Marvel doesn't fare well when comparing their animations to DC's offerings, but this one is excellent.  And of course being excellent means it had to get cancelled in favor of a lesser Avenger's animation.I am so happy to have it on blu-ray.  For some reason, Disney has refused to release it this way, forcing people to buy countless individual dvd  volumes at a much higher price and lower quality.  I imported this blu-ray and it's fantastic.  Colors and saturation are much better and the picture is beautiful.  The DVDs look fine to because most animation is already all digital these days, but these blu-rays stand out.As another reviewer pointed out; these blu-rays lack subtitles.  It's an odd omisison, but one I can live with to have this great animation in my collection.",5,The best animated series since Batman The Animated Series!,1401321600,"05 29, 2014",2014,997,"['animation', 'gold', 'love', 'series', 'sad', 'only', 'lasted', '2', 'seasons', 'least', 'were', '2', 'action', 'packed', 'filled', 'brim', 'seasons', 'Plenty', 'great', 'stories', 'were', 'told', 'lot', 'was', 'covered.Marvel', ""n't"", 'fare', 'well', 'when', 'comparing', 'animations', 'DC', 'offerings', 'one', 'excellent', 'course', 'being', 'excellent', 'means', 'had', 'get', 'cancelled', 'favor', 'lesser', 'Avenger', 'animation.I', 'am', 'so', 'happy', 'have', 'blu-ray', 'reason', 'Disney', 'refused', 'release', 'way', 'forcing', 'people', 'buy', 'countless', 'individual', 'dvd', 'volumes', 'much', 'higher', 'price', 'lower', 'quality', 'imported', 'blu-ray', 'fantastic', 'Colors', 'saturation', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'picture', 'beautiful', 'DVDs', 'look', 'fine', 'most', 'animation', 'already', 'digital', 'days', 'blu-rays', 'stand', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'blu-rays', 'lack', 'subtitles', 'odd', 'omisison', 'one', 'can', 'live', 'have', 'great', 'animation', 'collection']",The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes - Season 1

I waited on this until it came out in a full season format (hate those little collections).With some minor caveats, it was worth the wait.  This is the best Janet and Hank I've seen in animation.  There were great villains to fight, and they certainly thought about their plots.  Cap and Hela.  Love that.  And my favorite Jane Foster version.There were several Easter eggs I saw:Some of the mercenaries from the original Predator movie working for Klaw.Wild Bill from GI Joe a Hulkbuster helicopter pilot.The Futurist - reference to RDJ's album.Logan as a Howler.The SHIELD hovercar and barbershop.Had some quibbles.  Iron Man really went overboard on the arrogance, and too many things were ""his fault"".  Hulk was a bit too talkative.  And Loki really needs to wash off the mascara (yeah, I know, Frost Giant.  Still looks silly).  Sometimes continuity wasn't the best.  So, where did Janet's winter coat go?Definite pick up if a Marvel fan.No subtitles though.  Extra features are just some interviews, so that was quite disappointing.",5,Surprisingly good,1397347200,"04 13, 2014",2014,1072,"['26', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'waited', 'came', 'out', 'full', 'season', 'format', 'hate', 'little', 'collections', '.With', 'minor', 'caveats', 'was', 'worth', 'wait', 'best', 'Janet', 'Hank', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'animation', 'were', 'great', 'villains', 'fight', 'certainly', 'thought', 'plots', 'Cap', 'Hela', 'Love', 'favorite', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'were', 'several', 'Easter', 'eggs', 'saw', 'mercenaries', 'original', 'Predator', 'movie', 'working', 'Klaw.Wild', 'Bill', 'GI', 'Joe', 'Hulkbuster', 'helicopter', 'pilot.The', 'Futurist', 'reference', 'RDJ', 'album.Logan', 'Howler.The', 'SHIELD', 'hovercar', 'barbershop.Had', 'quibbles', 'Iron', 'Man', 'really', 'went', 'overboard', 'arrogance', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'were', 'fault', 'Hulk', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'talkative', 'Loki', 'really', 'wash', 'off', 'mascara', 'yeah', 'know', 'Frost', 'Giant', 'Still', 'silly', 'Sometimes', 'continuity', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'So', 'where', 'did', 'Janet', 'winter', 'coat', 'go', 'Definite', 'up', 'Marvel', 'fan.No', 'subtitles', 'Extra', 'features', 'are', 'just', 'interviews', 'was', 'quite', 'disappointing']",The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes - Season 1
