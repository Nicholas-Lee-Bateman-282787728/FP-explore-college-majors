Wes Craven and Eddie Murphy team up for a story of a Caribbean vampire who comes to New York to search for his 'queen.' It had the potential to be a good movie, either as a horror movie or as a parody of vampire movies. The problem is they tried to do both, a comedy and a horror story, and neither carried off very well. Murphy does do an excellent job as Maximillian (the lead role), and it might be one of his better performances. The other characters he played (a preacher and an Italian thug) were substandard. While Murphy's performance was great, the rest of the cast was wooden. Kadeem Hardison and John Witherspoon are the comic relief in the film. They are over the top and the movie just isn't horrific enough to need comic relief.

Eddie Murphy creates his 3 most Unmemorable characters for a film that Diverts Attention, but doesn't achieve much else, which is a Shame, because we All Know he can do Better. (""The Nutty Professor"" and ""Coming to America"")Eddies Much Talked about Leap into Comedy/Horror isn't really as bad as a lot of people make it out to be, it Scares a little, it causes a Snigger or two, and.. Well... It has Eddie Murphy, it can't be That Bad. Let me put it This Way, It's A Little Worse than ""Beverly Hills Cop III"", and it's A Lot Better than ""Holy Man""... Yeah, that pretty much Sums it Up.Eddie plays Maximillian the Vampire, from an Island in the Bermuda Triangle (which is quite a Clever and Unique way to explain him and his Kind) who comes to the Island of Manhattan in search of a Mate, he Limits his search to Brooklyn, and the film takes it from their. Though Eddie is never really Scary, or Convincingly Evil, he keeps a Straight face and makes the Horror bits work. Though I said about that the three characters he creates are his most Unmemorable, they are Still enjoyable enough to satisfy Eddie's Die Hard fans (the other two characters he plays are the Reverend, and the Italian Stick-up man). Angela Bassett is Above Average in her role as a Troubled Cop, torn between her Job and her Destiny. She never treats the role as Beneath her, and she gives it her All.The Performances in the Supporting cast are Mixed. Allen Payne is Believable and Likeable as Justice, Angela's Understanding Partner. Kadeem Harrison is Annoying as Julius Jones, Eddie's Ghoul and John Witherspoon is... Well, John Witherspoon as Silas. I find Witherspoon's Humour to be Pathetic, he just Sucks the laughter out of the room Whenever he's on screen. (like he does in ""Little Nicky"", ""Boomerang"" and ""Next Friday"")Overall, Murphy fans should find a Laugh here and there, and Horror fans should like the Dark mood and Photography.

393577,AEVDN809UQJHU,6303965792,curtis martin,"[20, 25]","In the 1980s, Eddie Murphy single-handedly recreated the Black Action hero, replacing the old murderous superstud of the 1970s with black characters who depended on their quick wits more than their big guns.  That formula was quickly run dry, however, both by Murphy himself and the imitators he inspired.So, Eddie intelligently decided that he needed to recreate a forgotten genre of comedy, one which Peter Sellars had mastered in the 60s, and which only Murphy could do today: he would make movies in which he played multiple characters. The Genesis began with &quot;Coming to America&quot;, in which Murphy played not only the lead role, but also all the inhabitants of a Harlem barbershop. The sequences were short, but Murphy was building the road to becoming the most brilliant character actor of our day. Soon followed the &quot;Nutty Professor&quot; movies, &quot;Bowfinger&quot;, and his animated TV series, &quot;The PJ's.&quot; In all these Murphy played a multiplicity of roles, and played them all brilliantly (the Academy's disdain for streetwise comedies, and--well, lets just say it--their dismissal of black performers not playing slaves or pimps, are the only explanations possible for Murphy not owning an Oscar or two by now).With these projects, Eddie was not only playing different characters, but also honing a new Eddie Murphy genre: raunchy, but intelligent; gross, but heartfelt; hilariously over the top in the particulars of plot, but firmly rooted in emotional reality. He has created or has been involved with, some of the arguably best comedies of the 1990's and onward--and has been responsible for inarguably the best comic performances of the era.So, in this era, Eddie decided to push the envelope by mixing the new Eddie Genre with the Horror films he loved as a kid. The result, &quot;A Vampire in Brooklyn&quot;, is unsettling to some because the lines between Eddie's wildly improvisational Black (or African American, if you insist) character comedy to straight vampire horror movie are so starkly drawn. There are very few instances where the comedy and horror overlap. This, I feel, is the brilliance of the film. There are no horror moments broken by a punchline or bad joke, and there are no comedy moments punctuated by some kind of sick horror gag (that has been done to death since John Landis' &quot;American Werewolf in London&quot;. Now its being beated to death by &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;). The funny parts are funny and the scary parts are truly scary.  And Murphy also gets to shine in multiple well-defined character parts as well, as the shape-shifting African Vampire assumes the physical identity of several of his victims.&quot;Vampire&quot; failed at the box office not because it was a bad film--its definitely is not. But because it was too unusual a film for the limited abilities of the studio's marketing department to sell. Those going expecting to see a comedy were disappointed it contained so much pure horror, and those going to see it based on the publicity that painted it as a horror film were dissapointed it contained so much hilarious Murphy style comedy. It dies because of false expectations. Eddie's other films contained quick changes in tone as well--the shifts between bathroom comedy and pathos in the Nutty Professor films is no less abrupt than those between horror and comedy in &quot;Vampire&quot;. It's just that the choice of horror as the second element mixed with the comedy is a more daring and unusual one.Years from now, &quot;A Vampire in Brooklyn&quot; will be viewed as one of the highpoints of the second phase of the Eddie Murphy Genre.",4,A Brilliant twist on the '90s Murphy formula!,995846400,"07 23, 2001",2001,3648,"['1980s', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'single-handedly', 'recreated', 'Black', 'Action', 'hero', 'replacing', 'old', 'murderous', 'superstud', '1970s', 'black', 'characters', 'who', 'depended', 'quick', 'wits', 'more', 'big', 'guns', 'formula', 'was', 'quickly', 'run', 'dry', 'however', 'Murphy', 'imitators', 'Eddie', 'intelligently', 'decided', 'needed', 'recreate', 'forgotten', 'genre', 'comedy', 'one', 'Peter', 'Sellars', 'had', 'mastered', '60s', 'only', 'Murphy', 'could', 'do', 'today', 'would', 'make', 'movies', 'played', 'multiple', 'characters', 'Genesis', 'began', 'quot', 'Coming', 'America', 'quot', 'Murphy', 'played', 'not', 'only', 'lead', 'role', 'also', 'inhabitants', 'Harlem', 'barbershop', 'sequences', 'were', 'short', 'Murphy', 'was', 'building', 'road', 'becoming', 'most', 'brilliant', 'character', 'actor', 'day', 'Soon', 'followed', 'quot', 'Nutty', 'Professor', 'quot', 'movies', 'quot', 'Bowfinger', 'quot', 'animated', 'TV', 'series', 'quot', ""PJ's."", 'quot', 'Murphy', 'played', 'multiplicity', 'roles', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Academy', 'disdain', 'streetwise', 'comedies', 'well', 'just', 'say', 'dismissal', 'black', 'performers', 'not', 'playing', 'slaves', 'pimps', 'are', 'only', 'explanations', 'possible', 'Murphy', 'not', 'owning', 'Oscar', 'two', 'now', 'projects', 'Eddie', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'playing', 'different', 'characters', 'also', 'honing', 'new', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'genre', 'raunchy', 'intelligent', 'gross', 'heartfelt', 'hilariously', 'top', 'particulars', 'plot', 'firmly', 'rooted', 'emotional', 'reality', 'created', 'been', 'involved', 'arguably', 'best', 'comedies', '1990', 'onward', 'been', 'responsible', 'inarguably', 'best', 'comic', 'performances', 'era.So', 'era', 'Eddie', 'decided', 'push', 'envelope', 'mixing', 'new', 'Eddie', 'Genre', 'Horror', 'films', 'loved', 'kid', 'result', 'quot', 'A', 'Vampire', 'Brooklyn', 'quot', 'unsettling', 'lines', 'Eddie', 'wildly', 'improvisational', 'Black', 'African', 'American', 'insist', 'character', 'comedy', 'straight', 'vampire', 'horror', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'starkly', 'drawn', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'instances', 'where', 'comedy', 'horror', 'overlap', 'feel', 'brilliance', 'film', 'are', 'horror', 'moments', 'broken', 'punchline', 'bad', 'joke', 'are', 'comedy', 'moments', 'punctuated', 'kind', 'sick', 'horror', 'gag', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'John', 'Landis', 'quot', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'quot', 'Now', 'being', 'beated', 'death', 'quot', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'quot', 'funny', 'parts', 'are', 'funny', 'scary', 'parts', 'are', 'truly', 'scary', 'Murphy', 'also', 'shine', 'multiple', 'well-defined', 'character', 'parts', 'as', 'well', 'shape-shifting', 'African', 'Vampire', 'physical', 'identity', 'several', 'victims.', 'quot', 'Vampire', 'quot', 'failed', 'box', 'office', 'not', 'was', 'bad', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'was', 'too', 'unusual', 'film', 'limited', 'abilities', 'studio', 'marketing', 'department', 'sell', 'going', 'expecting', 'see', 'comedy', 'were', 'disappointed', 'contained', 'so', 'much', 'pure', 'horror', 'going', 'see', 'based', 'publicity', 'painted', 'horror', 'film', 'were', 'dissapointed', 'contained', 'so', 'much', 'hilarious', 'Murphy', 'style', 'comedy', 'false', 'expectations', 'Eddie', 'other', 'films', 'contained', 'quick', 'changes', 'tone', 'as', 'well', 'shifts', 'bathroom', 'comedy', 'pathos', 'Nutty', 'Professor', 'films', 'less', 'abrupt', 'horror', 'comedy', 'quot', 'Vampire', 'quot', 'just', 'choice', 'horror', 'second', 'element', 'mixed', 'comedy', 'more', 'daring', 'unusual', 'one.Years', 'now', 'quot', 'A', 'Vampire', 'Brooklyn', 'quot', 'will', 'be', 'viewed', 'one', 'highpoints', 'second', 'phase', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Genre']",Vampire in Brooklyn VHS

This hybird, of course, is played by Angela Bassett named Rita.Allen Payne also stars as Justice, Rita's cop partner and potential lover who ends up fighting to save her soul from being seduced into a life of a vampire of Maximillion.Kadeem Harddison plays as Eddie's ghoul and henchman while John Whitherspoon plays Kadeem's uncle.

The thing that stops it from reaching its full potential is the clumsy direction of Wes Craven. Eddie is funny as usual but Kadeem Hardison couldnt have been more annoying.

From the reviews I've seen and on Rotten Tomatoes this movie was supposedly terrible, not funny, bad, a waste of time...but then again everyone is entitled to their own opinion even if they're wrong.It starts out with an unknown ship arriving at Brooklyn Harbor but the crew is mysteriously dead. Not knowing that something came on shore, Rita(Angela Bassett) a disturbed somewhat psychic police officer and her partner Justice (Allen Payne)are called to the scene. Together they work on this case only to unravel that there is a Vampire in Brooklyn and he has his eyes set Rita. I loved this movie, it was awesome. I can say that (in my opinion) this is one of Eddie Murphy's best. Angela Bassett was wonderful and they played their roles perfectly.The fact that Eddie Murphy is playing as the main character as a Vampire, people would see this as a lame movie and they won't take it seriously, but I found it to be very good and I would recommend it to anyone who would love to see a movie about destinies, life, death, love, and vampires...not the sparkling kind.

While there is comedy here, Eddie's role is basically a serious one.  I applaud him for stretching out as an actor, taking a risk, and basically delivering the &#34;goods&#34; with his performance.  He amazes with his versatility in personas.  The film itself is just another take on the familiar Vampire theme.  I thought well done enough to provide a new slant and entertaining couple of hours of fun.  The supporting cast and co-stars do well enough so as not to detract from the story being told.  I give high marks for trying but 4 optimistic stars because, well, its not a James Cameron product here!  This effort got &#34;lost in the shuffle&#34; of releases I think, but I am out on a limb somewhat with my rating.
