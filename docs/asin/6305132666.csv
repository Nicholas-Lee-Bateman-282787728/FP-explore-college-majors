A Few Good Men was outstanding, Malice was great, and I also watched Sports Night for a while until it was cancelled. I like Aaron Sorkin's style of writing. The situations are plausible and believable, the characters are written inteligently, the plotting is uniformly excellent, plus there is lots of wit interjected to make it funny. This movie is no exception to any of the rules. Rob Reiner helms this picture and does his usual bang-up job, with more subtlety than usual. The acting is great all around: Michael Douglas is great as the lonely president, Martin Sheen as his Chief of Staff (who is now the President on West Wing), Annette Bening and Michael J. Fox as a hyper and hypochondriac policy adviser is the standout. This is the only romantic comedy I own and I would advise you to buy it too. It also contains an excellent speech at the end by President Andrew Shepard. &quot;It's a time for serious people, Bob, and your fifteen minutes are up.&quot; Enjoy",4,"I'm Not A Romantic Comedy Fan, But I Love This Movie",998352000,"08 21, 2001",2001,1210,"['American', 'President', 'inspired', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'explore', 'Presidency', 'weekly', 'television', 'show', 'brought', 'hit', 'show', 'quot', 'West', 'Wing.', 'quot', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'show', 'naturally', 'saw', 'Sorkin', 'other', 'works', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'was', 'outstanding', 'Malice', 'was', 'great', 'also', 'watched', 'Sports', 'Night', 'while', 'was', 'cancelled', 'like', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'style', 'writing', 'situations', 'are', 'plausible', 'believable', 'characters', 'are', 'written', 'inteligently', 'plotting', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'lots', 'wit', 'interjected', 'make', 'funny', 'movie', 'exception', 'rules', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'helms', 'picture', 'usual', 'bang-up', 'job', 'more', 'subtlety', 'usual', 'acting', 'great', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'great', 'lonely', 'president', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'who', 'now', 'President', 'West', 'Wing', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'hyper', 'hypochondriac', 'policy', 'adviser', 'standout', 'only', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'own', 'would', 'advise', 'buy', 'too', 'also', 'excellent', 'speech', 'end', 'President', 'Andrew', 'Shepard', 'quot', 'time', 'serious', 'people', 'Bob', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'are', 'up.', 'quot', 'Enjoy']",The American President VHS

450584,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305132666,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I had very little interest in seeing this movie.  I'm just going to put that out there.  I have this thing about Michael Douglas (he's just somewhat uninteresting) and Annette Bening (overly theatrical and unnatural for the most part) and yet I was told by so many that this was such a great romantic comedy that I felt compelled to give it a go.I really liked this!Sure, some of the plot points were familiar, predictable and preposterous to a degree and yet it worked so well thanks to the sharp writing (Sorkin can write anything) and the devoted performances.  It isn't just Bening and Douglas who carry this film though.  The entire ensemble is delightful, with Martin Sheen delivering a standup supporting role that has so many layers and steals every scene.  I was particularly blown over by Douglas though, who takes on this role and gives it such life and honesty.  He's touching, tender, funny, charming and earnest and he makes it all look so light and natural.The story itself needed serious help.  When you take a step back and look at it, it's rather dumb in concept.  The President, a widower who won his election thanks to the death of his wife (no one wants to smear the recently widowed) is up for re-election, and his competition is fierce (a seething Richard Dreyfuss).  When he makes the decision to woo a lobbyist, his staff goes into hyper drive trying their hardest to maintain their president's image and shield him from attack, but it's of no use and soon not only is he under attack, but the woman in his life is feeling the heat.Of course, love always finds a way, and while the closing speech is overblown to the enth, Douglas sells it nicely.Overall, I really, really liked this.  For what it is, it is above average, and that means a lot when you consider the amount of average and below average that comes out of this genre.  The cast, the dialog (so fresh, funny and sharp) and the general atmosphere (Reiner is considered a hack and sellout by many, but he has delivered quite a few great films) are all worthy of your attention.",4,Far better than I expected...,1370304000,"06 4, 2013",2013,2063,"['had', 'very', 'little', 'interest', 'seeing', 'movie', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'put', 'there', 'have', 'thing', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'just', 'somewhat', 'uninteresting', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'overly', 'theatrical', 'unnatural', 'most', 'part', 'yet', 'was', 'told', 'so', 'many', 'was', 'such', 'great', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'felt', 'compelled', 'give', 'go.I', 'really', 'liked', 'Sure', 'plot', 'points', 'were', 'familiar', 'predictable', 'preposterous', 'degree', 'yet', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'thanks', 'sharp', 'writing', 'Sorkin', 'can', 'write', 'anything', 'devoted', 'performances', ""n't"", 'just', 'Bening', 'Douglas', 'who', 'carry', 'film', 'entire', 'ensemble', 'delightful', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'delivering', 'standup', 'supporting', 'role', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'steals', 'scene', 'was', 'particularly', 'blown', 'over', 'Douglas', 'who', 'role', 'such', 'life', 'honesty', 'touching', 'tender', 'funny', 'charming', 'earnest', 'look', 'so', 'light', 'natural.The', 'story', 'needed', 'serious', 'help', 'When', 'take', 'step', 'back', 'look', 'rather', 'dumb', 'concept', 'President', 'widower', 'who', 'won', 'election', 'thanks', 'death', 'wife', 'one', 'smear', 'recently', 'widowed', 'up', 're-election', 'competition', 'fierce', 'seething', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'When', 'decision', 'woo', 'lobbyist', 'staff', 'hyper', 'drive', 'trying', 'hardest', 'maintain', 'president', 'image', 'shield', 'attack', 'use', 'soon', 'not', 'only', 'attack', 'woman', 'life', 'feeling', 'heat.Of', 'course', 'love', 'always', 'way', 'closing', 'speech', 'overblown', 'enth', 'Douglas', 'nicely.Overall', 'really', 'really', 'liked', 'what', 'above', 'average', 'lot', 'when', 'consider', 'amount', 'average', 'below', 'average', 'genre', 'cast', 'dialog', 'so', 'fresh', 'funny', 'sharp', 'general', 'atmosphere', 'Reiner', 'considered', 'hack', 'sellout', 'many', 'delivered', 'quite', 'few', 'great', 'films', 'are', 'worthy', 'attention']",The American President VHS

Because these people are so human, and it's been a long time since we had any reason to expect that in the White House [review written in 2008].President Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas) is a widower, and in fact has raised his 12-year-old daughter almost single-handedly. She's a bright, sensible, nice, but not particularly pretty child, so he must have gotten a few things right. Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening) is a lobbyist for an important piece of environmental legislation. Conflicts of interest professionally do not stop them from a good bit of interest personally.But as his chief of staff, A. J. MacIneney (Martin Sheen) points out, presidents do not just call a girl up for a date. Well, this one does. At first Sydney assumes it is an old friend of hers making a silly joke when she receives the call. So President Shepherd, thinking fast, tells her to hang up, call the phone number he gives her, which is the main switchboard at the White House. She does, and it is. The operator says, ""Oh, yes, Ms. Wade, the president is expecting your call. I'll put you right through.""She can barely talk, and he doesn't really know what to say, either. After all, his secretary sets up his phone calls, and it's been a very long time since he asked a woman for a date. But he manages to convey that they are having a reception dinner at the White House the next night for the new French president, and he would like her to be his date.Naturally, the press go bonkers. There are photos of the two of them dancing all over the front page of every newspaper in the country. And when his biggest opponent from the ""other party"" (party names are never mentioned), Robert Rumson (Richard Dreyfus) gets hold of this picture and the scandal he whips up, the president's approval rating in the poles plummets.All his aids are in a panic the first time Sydney sleeps over at the White House. Lewis Rothschild (Michael J. Fox) is supposed to come up with statistics on the various polls, Leon Kodak (David Paymer) is trying to pin down support for the president's crime bill, and it's amusing to see how they assume this is going to ruin his chances for re-election on the ""character issue"" Rumson has cooked up.My only question is why didn't he resolve the issue by asking her to marry him? His daughter likes her, Sydney likes the daughter, Andy and Sydney are clearly nuts about each other, so why? And why did none of his advisers mention the idea? And why, come to that, didn't his daughter? I kept expecting her to say something.Maybe it was because the president viewed that as giving in to the gossips and ""character issue"" BS-slingers. And indeed, he handles the situation very well in the end.

450606,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,6305132666,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[2, 4]","Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Music, The American President should have been considered for other Oscars as well (maybe even Best Picture, although I realize it's not the great drama of the century). Nevertheless, The American President is a fun romantic comedy reminiscent of the old Frank Capra movies. Although not handled with kid gloves, the president comes across as fairly shy and innocent in his relationship with a Washington lobbyist, creating a charming contrast considering the power of his office. Released in 1995, The American President is one of a number of mainstream movies favorably focused on the presidency, with Dave and Air Force One leading the list (did liberal Hollywood producers hope some of the favorable light would rub off on Clinton?) That's debatable. But what's not debatable is that The American President is one of the best romantic comedies of the decade...Michael Douglas plays the role of Andrew Shepard, widower and President of the United States. In the political world, Shepard is king - enjoying unprecedented highs in his job approval rating. But the president's private world is empty. The president's daughter is the only close person in his personal life, and he greatly misses his wife. Following an environmental policy meeting with Washington lobbyist Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening), Shepard considers asking her out. But he takes advice from aides A.J. MacInerney (Martin Sheen) and Lewis Rothschild (Michael J. Fox) en route to making his decision.When the president does arrange a date with Sydney, her presence at the White House is leaked to the media, and the president's approval rating falls (I'm not exactly sure why, seeing as how the American public would have to be totally deranged to forbid a widower from dating). The growing scandal is further compounded by opposition leader Senator Bob Rumson (Richard Dreyfuss) who uses the scandal as a launching pad for his own campaign to win the presidency. Will the good guys win, or will the evil Rumson take down the president?The plot structure of The American President is nothing new, and the screenplay itself is far from masterful. But what makes this film so successful is the way in which the cast breathes life into the dialogue. Michael Douglas, as President Andrew Shepard, shows the audience why he is a Hollywood titan. His presidential demeanor is a West Wing prelude which should make Martin Sheen proud, yet his interaction with Sydney Ellen Wade and his daughter Lucy (Shawna Waldron) paint a human picture of a tough political character. The other half of the equation, Annette Bening, plays her role to perfection as well, transforming from the rough political creature of a hard-nosed Washington lobbyist to a giggly school girl swept off her feet by a great guy (who, incidentally, happens to be the president).One of the more interesting aspects of The American President is that the screenwriters made Andrew Shepard a widower and not a divorcee. Despite the overall acceptance of divorce in current society, the film wouldn't have worked if the president were divorced. Subconsciously, it would implant an idea in some members of the audience that he's a dog. That's an interesting footnote in my opinion. Also of further note are the appearances of Michael J. Fox (who later starred as a political operative in the TV series Spin City) and Martin Sheen (who later starred as the president in the TV series West Wing). Did The American President peak their interest in such roles, or were they already pursuing those types of roles? Either way, The American President will delight and entertain audiences of all ages, and that's why it's a definite must-see movie...The DVD Report",4,"A bit cheesy and cliched, but I can see why people love it",1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,3726,"['Nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Music', 'American', 'President', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'other', 'Oscars', 'well', 'maybe', 'even', 'Best', 'Picture', 'realize', 'not', 'great', 'drama', 'century', 'Nevertheless', 'American', 'President', 'fun', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'reminiscent', 'old', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'movies', 'not', 'handled', 'kid', 'gloves', 'president', 'fairly', 'shy', 'innocent', 'relationship', 'Washington', 'lobbyist', 'creating', 'charming', 'contrast', 'considering', 'power', 'office', 'Released', '1995', 'American', 'President', 'one', 'number', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'favorably', 'focused', 'presidency', 'Dave', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', 'leading', 'list', 'did', 'liberal', 'Hollywood', 'producers', 'hope', 'favorable', 'light', 'would', 'rub', 'off', 'Clinton', 'debatable', 'what', 'not', 'debatable', 'American', 'President', 'one', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'decade', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'role', 'Andrew', 'Shepard', 'widower', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'political', 'world', 'Shepard', 'king', 'enjoying', 'unprecedented', 'highs', 'job', 'approval', 'rating', 'president', 'private', 'world', 'empty', 'president', 'daughter', 'only', 'close', 'person', 'personal', 'life', 'greatly', 'wife', 'Following', 'environmental', 'policy', 'meeting', 'Washington', 'lobbyist', 'Sydney', 'Ellen', 'Wade', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Shepard', 'asking', 'out', 'advice', 'aides', 'A.J', 'MacInerney', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Lewis', 'Rothschild', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'route', 'making', 'decision.When', 'president', 'arrange', 'date', 'Sydney', 'presence', 'White', 'House', 'leaked', 'media', 'president', 'approval', 'rating', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'why', 'seeing', 'how', 'American', 'public', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'totally', 'deranged', 'forbid', 'widower', 'dating', 'growing', 'scandal', 'further', 'compounded', 'opposition', 'leader', 'Senator', 'Bob', 'Rumson', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'who', 'scandal', 'launching', 'pad', 'own', 'campaign', 'win', 'presidency', 'Will', 'good', 'guys', 'win', 'will', 'evil', 'Rumson', 'take', 'down', 'president', 'plot', 'structure', 'American', 'President', 'nothing', 'new', 'screenplay', 'far', 'masterful', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'successful', 'way', 'cast', 'life', 'dialogue', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'President', 'Andrew', 'Shepard', 'audience', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'titan', 'presidential', 'demeanor', 'West', 'Wing', 'prelude', 'should', 'make', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'proud', 'yet', 'interaction', 'Sydney', 'Ellen', 'Wade', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'Shawna', 'Waldron', 'paint', 'human', 'picture', 'tough', 'political', 'character', 'other', 'half', 'equation', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'role', 'perfection', 'as', 'well', 'transforming', 'rough', 'political', 'creature', 'hard-nosed', 'Washington', 'lobbyist', 'giggly', 'school', 'girl', 'swept', 'off', 'feet', 'great', 'guy', 'who', 'incidentally', 'be', 'president', '.One', 'more', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'American', 'President', 'screenwriters', 'made', 'Andrew', 'Shepard', 'widower', 'not', 'divorcee', 'overall', 'acceptance', 'divorce', 'current', 'society', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked', 'president', 'were', 'divorced', 'Subconsciously', 'would', 'implant', 'idea', 'members', 'audience', 'dog', 'interesting', 'footnote', 'opinion', 'Also', 'further', 'note', 'are', 'appearances', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'who', 'later', 'starred', 'political', 'operative', 'TV', 'series', 'Spin', 'City', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'who', 'later', 'starred', 'president', 'TV', 'series', 'West', 'Wing', 'American', 'President', 'peak', 'interest', 'such', 'roles', 'were', 'already', 'pursuing', 'types', 'roles', 'way', 'American', 'President', 'will', 'delight', 'entertain', 'audiences', 'ages', 'why', 'definite', 'must-see', 'movie', 'DVD', 'Report']",The American President VHS

He becomes romantically interested in an environmental lobbyist, Sidney Ellen Wade (Annette Benning) which turns out to cause a lot of problems for both of them.These two high-powered actors manage to humanize their characters into ordinary, likable people who are just trying to fall in love despite unbelievable opulence of surroundings, ugly political maneuvering and living inside a media fishbowl of publicity.  Along the way, there are plenty of funny, heartwarming moments including a couple of very funny telephone calls.

And he wrote an impressive movie in ""The American President"".Unfortunately, there's no ""Making Of"" type of materials included on the DVD.  We get a trailer for the film, plus some production and bio (text) notes, but nothing more in the way of bonuses. (Perhaps a ""Special Edition"" DVD Edition will some day surface.  That'd be sweet indeed.)While it's certainly true that the picture quality on this non-anamorphic Warner Brothers DVD-Video is far from being perfect....I still think it's in a highly-watchable condition.  Sure, we get the usual amount of ""jaggies"" and blurred images of stuff in the background inherent to an image that's not been enhanced for 16x9 televisions. But I don't really think it's the worst DVD transfer ever to come along either.  Of course, mileage will vary. Everyone has their own definition of ""bad"".The soundtrack, on the other hand, seems quite robust and nice. There's a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround track on this disc.""The American President"" is presented here in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1. I've seen information elsewhere that claims this DVD presents the movie in a 1.85:1 ratio, which is inaccurate. So don't be fooled, it's definitely shown here in its full w-i-d-e ""scope"" ratio of 2.35:1.This is a fresh, funny, smart, sassy, intelligent film, no matter if it's your first time seeing it, or your hundreth.

As an ardent environmentalist, Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening) lobbies the president to press Congress for a 20% reduction in carbon emissions rather than a safer 10% reduction, which will be easier to get through. Then the president finds himself faced with a state dinner to welcome the President of France but without a dinner companion, as his previous partner is ill. Wade gets invited in her place and so the romance begins. Michael J. Fox is good as an annoying and over-enthusiastic Advisor on Domestic Policy, Lewis Rothschild; and Richard Dreyfuss is the appropriately sour Republican Senator Bob Rumson and Leader of the House.  I guess we could call this a romantic comedy and it's thoroughly entertaining. There is a lot of witty and extremely well-written dialogue and the characters are quite believable - which is why West Wing was also such a success.

Martin Sheen is great in his supporting role. Michael J. Fox is always a plus in a movie.The movie is about president who lost his wife, who falls for a environmental lobbyist.  The struggle comes from Richard Dryfus's character ""Bob Rumpsfeld"" (bad nomanclature). He finds out that this woman is an extreme left lobbyist.  He uses this to throw stones at the president, who he is trying to defeat in the coming election.  The presidential staff characters are wonderfully acted and fun to watch.  The interaction in the staff is Golden.People should look at this movie as a movie, not a political statement. Of course the movie has liberal themes.  When a filmmaker makes a movie, the audience is what he/she is working to please.  It is hard to romanticize a conservative agenda.  This movie's target audience is women(Even thought I love it). Do you think a woman is going to want a watch a romantic dramedy with a central theme of business, welfare reform, or maybe even limiting awards in malpractice suits? NO, of course not. I am a conservative, and I don't want to watch a romanitic comedy about my agenda.  Two things that are heart felt issues on both sides of the isle are the environment and gun control.

If the story had, instead, focused on the budding love of the principals and then given them true credibility (Benning gives in WAY too fast as a journalist and professional, and Douglas struts around making decisions that impact millions of people both positively and negatively as if he had spoken to the burning bush instead of Moses), I probably would've enjoyed the picture more.Outside of Douglas's grandstanding speech at the end (which is given excessive and unnecessary dead weight by a seemingly Earth-shaken Richard Dreyfuss as a 'mean and nasty' Republican senator), there are very few memorable moments here.  The love affair happens too fast and involves too little consequence (other than humorous ones), and it's all neat, tidy, and acceptable as far as the pollsters would have the American people think.The secondary players here end up doing a far better job than the principals as they're not suckered into the obvious politicking of the film.  Had Rob Reiner not been so much in love with Bill Clinton or had he decided on using a better role model as President, again it may've all ended up getting a second term (think ""sequel"").",2,Wouldn't Get My Vote,1039305600,"12 8, 2002",2002,1837,"['Michael', 'Douglas', 'largely', 'smug', 'President', 'think', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'Annette', 'Benning', 'wiley', 'intellectually-equal', 'sparing', 'mate', 'think', 'Hilary', 'Clinton', 'life', 'love', 'journalist', 'assigned', 'White', 'House', 'Press', 'Corps', 'THE', 'AMERICAN', 'PRESIDENT', 'forget', 'Monica', 'Lewinsky', 'Gennifer', 'Flowers', 'other', 'women', '.Ugh.Politics.I', 'suppose', 'would', 'rate', 'film', 'higher', 'performances', 'such', 'contrived', 'romance', 'were', 'marginally', 'believable', 'sadly', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'large', 'Hollywood', 'misfire', 'aimed', 'showing', 'how', 'evil', 'Republicans', 'are', 'how', 'righteous', 'Democrats', 'are', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'basically', 'confirmed', 'press', 'tour', 'story', 'had', 'instead', 'focused', 'budding', 'love', 'principals', 'then', 'given', 'true', 'credibility', 'Benning', 'WAY', 'too', 'fast', 'journalist', 'professional', 'Douglas', 'struts', 'making', 'decisions', 'impact', 'millions', 'people', 'positively', 'negatively', 'had', 'spoken', 'burning', 'bush', 'instead', 'Moses', 'probably', 'would', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'picture', 'more.Outside', 'Douglas', 'grandstanding', 'speech', 'end', 'given', 'excessive', 'unnecessary', 'dead', 'weight', 'seemingly', 'Earth-shaken', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', ""'mean"", 'nasty', 'Republican', 'senator', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'memorable', 'moments', 'here', 'love', 'affair', 'too', 'fast', 'too', 'little', 'consequence', 'other', 'humorous', 'ones', 'neat', 'tidy', 'acceptable', 'as', 'far', 'pollsters', 'would', 'have', 'American', 'people', 'think.The', 'secondary', 'players', 'here', 'end', 'up', 'doing', 'far', 'better', 'job', 'principals', ""'re"", 'not', 'suckered', 'obvious', 'politicking', 'film', 'Had', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'had', 'decided', 'using', 'better', 'role', 'model', 'President', 'again', 'may', ""'ve"", 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'second', 'term', 'think', 'sequel']",The American President VHS

They have the same setting and tone, and writer Aaron Sorkin is the man behind both. His stories are never about toppling the empire, but they are about the people who help make democracy work, and the elements are rarely heavy-handed. Sorkin writes both appealing lead characters and secondary ones who are policy nerds, comic foils, or both.Michael Douglas plays Andrew Shepherd, a widower President, which is unusual, and a bit awkward for him. He is serious about his job, but his dry wit and easy banter with his staff make him very engaging. When he meets environmental lobbyist Sydney Ellen Wade, played by Annette Bening, their chemistry is powerful and is what really propels the movie. Their first date is at a State Dinner, and allows them that first dance (depicted on DVD sleeves in real life), and on newspaper front pages in the movie. It sets the stage for the non-issue which becomes a very real one, that weaves its way throughout the last 2/3rds of the story.""The President's got a girlfriend,"" sneers Sen. Bob Rumson, played with relish by Richard Dreyfuss. He is the presumptive Republican candidate who will face Shepherd when he runs for re-election. Rumson sets out to dig dirt on Ms. Wade. There isn't any, but politics is perception, and Rumson takes to the TV news shows to accuse Ms. Wade of treason and prostitution. President Shepherd, who up to now has been silent, noting that he doesn't have the luxury of losing his temper, has had enough. He crashes the daily press briefing to deliver a classic speech which allows him to admit his weaknesses, successfully refute Rumson's charges, and make a case for happiness in his personal life. He winds things up by being very presidential. Both Sorkin and director Rob Reiner excel at pulling off this kind of scene.The movie wraps up as neatly as you might expect, but that's OK. The supporting cast is all excellent; Martin Sheen is the president's closest adviser, and would become the president on ""The West Wing."" Anna Devere Smith, Michael J. Fox, David Paymer, Samantha Mathis and John Mahoney among others, all lend very able support.

450658,A2VE83MZF98ITY,6305132666,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[0, 2]","Before the successful run of the series 'West Wing', Aaron Sorkin created another presidential drama for the big screen, entitled 'The American President' (the film co-stars Martin Sheen, who would go on to be the president, Josiah Bartlett, in the television series). This is one of the first fictional accounts of life in the White House to concentrate more on the private lives of the people who work there, particularly the president, more than the politics or policies that make up the work of the place. (I like to pair this film for viewing with 'Dave', a comedy starring Kevin Kline who stands in for a president who had a stroke; this also deals in a different way with the private lives of those in the White House.)This film is very well done in terms of detail; the sets for the White House are incredible, and the footage for placing shots taken around the actual White House and around Washington are truly remarkable. The Oval Office set was constructed for the film 'Dave', and is also the one that continues to be used on the West Wing, along with other sets. A bit of trivia: When Shepherd first calls Wade to ask her out on a date, she doesn't believe him, and hangs up the phone. When Shepherd rang back, he gave Wade a number to call him back - 456-1414 - which is in fact the number to the White House switchboard (with a D.C. area code 202).Also, for a film that doesn't concentrate on the issues of policy, the backdrop of the policy struggles are also very interesting to watch. For such dramas, policy issues must necessarily be bare-bones in terms of presentation, but one does get a sense of the politics involved when the president has to make a tough choice between two favoured projects as to which one is going to get his support. In the end (and I'm not giving away the ending, because it remains unresolved) President Shepherd does come to support both projects, but this is intended as a more feel-good move to set the film on a course of idealism and principle winning out over politics - in other words, a Hollywood ending.President Shepherd is a liberal president, but quite distinct from being a copy of Clinton. We get the sense that character debates for Clinton are being played out by writer Aaron Sorkin and producer/director Rob Reiner (one of the leading directors in Hollywood), but they don't quite match, given the different personal situations for Shepherd and Clinton. Shepherd is a widower, whose wife died during the campaign. He has a high-school aged daughter, played by Shawna Waldron (who is remarkably well-adjusted for being someone who both lost her mother and being a politician's child), and tries to navigate the difficulties of being a single parent and president at the same time.Enter into the scene, rather near the president's first term of office, Sydney Ellen Wade (played by Annette Bening). Wade is a professional lobbyist (who, we find out later, makes more money than the president - this is not unusual in politics) hired to bolster the environmental lobby's efforts to pass major legislation. Wade is an attractive, single lady used to the rough-and-tumble of politics, although occasionally seems a bit nave, as does Shepherd, as their relationship deepens and the press papparazi begin to circle. Her appearance on the scene knocks Shepherd out of his complacency, and he begins a courtship that is in full view of the world press, as well as the conservative challengers to the election, that is happening in one year's time.Michael Douglas plays the role of the president with panache but also with a bit of imperiousness; perhaps this cannot be avoided by anyone who wants such an august role, (in real life or in acting) but there is a tension between the idea of the liberal, for-the-people president who then also acts in a rather elitist and condescending manner. Douglas's main opponent politically is Senator Bob Rumson (doubtlessly a character drawn from the public image of Bob Dole), who is presented in a very monochromatic way (the complexity of the conservative side would be shown in Sorkin's series, 'The West Wing' in more detail, but still suffers from bias). Richard Dreyfuss plays this role well, but is prevented from developing this character as much more than a nemesis both by the writing and the on-screen time constraints.Martin Sheen plays Andrew Shepherd's chief of staff, A.J. MacInerney (it would have been a nice touch if MacInerney would have been the president, rather than Bartlett, for 'The West Wing'). Sheen's role is well-done, but again we see more of the personal rather than the political here - MacInerney is Shepherd's best friend in here, rather than being chief of staff. Another major role went to Michael J. Fox, who as Lewis Rothschild was really playing the character of George Stephanopoulos. Also starring is Anna Deavere Smith as press secretary (she will also go on to 'The West Wing' as National Security Advisor, the role Condaleeza Rice had prior to becoming Secretary of State.This is a polished film, very well done, with lots of details and a nice romantic story. It is biased in the liberal direction - many Republican friends I know like the film, but I have yet to find one who loves it. For Sorkin, this is the kind of liberal president that he'd like to have (and Bartlett on 'The West Wing' is a further extension of that), but reality rarely lives up to such ideals in any direction.A well-done film, with minor flaws, but good appeal.",4,Idealistic presidential relationships and politics,1130371200,"10 27, 2005",2005,5480,"['successful', 'run', 'series', ""'West"", 'Wing', 'Aaron',

Fans of his television shows ""Sports Night"" and ""The West Wing"" know this already, as do anyone who saw his play ""A Few Good Men"" or its filmed adaptation. In ""The American President,"" Sorkin teams up again with ""Good Men"" director Rob Reiner to provide, again, a political drama that manages to remain human and endearing, primarily due to Sorkin's magnificent lines.Michael Douglas plays President Andrew Shephard, a widower, who, although the President, happens to be a decent person. Annette Benning plays a lobbyist who, despite being a lobbyist, is also decent. These two decent people meet each other and fall in love, though their love is thwarted by the wholly indecent Richard Dreyfus as a petty little twerp of a Republican candidate, using their liasons as political fodder. Will our heroes survive? Save us, Frank Capra!The setup works well, and all the performances are splendid. The highlight is Sorkin's writing, and the highlights in Sorkin's writing here are the great speeches. Hey, it's Presidential. The film is made by Douglas's gripping, propelling speech to the press club at the climax of the film where he politically ...-slaps Dreyfus and stands up for his woman. It's great, makes you want to stand up and cheer for the country and several liberal-leaning policies like gun-control and greenhouse emissions (Sorkin, thankfully, was allowed to through in some political ""lobbying"" of his own, as usual. No one wants an apolitical movie about the President, for crying out loud). Michael J. Fox as advisor Lewis Rothchild also gets his two copper cents in as an insider who is somehow undamaged by soul-crippling Washington and has maintained his idealism. Fox makes up believe it, which is shocking.Now, while the speeches are great, the rest of the dialogue never manages the wit and pace that is Sorkin. Reiner's directing, in their second team-up, doesn't seem to keep up with the script, and most of the exchanges are flawed. We can see how they should be, but they aren't there yet. It's too bad, and mars an otherwise great film.I try to imagine our current President acting in the same regards as Douglas in ""The American President"": noble, intelligent, dignified. But I can't.

Dreyfus continually trashes Douglas until he finally stands up to him, and then everything is fine.  The film ended up being a very preachy film, even though it was something I generally agree with (I did vote for Clinton, though not with great enthusiasm).  I don't like when films preach.  They never get their message across.  They all end up very heavy handed.  The film is rather naive and simplistic, but that isn't surprising, consider Aaron Sorkin wrote it (The West Wing is a horrible show, too naive and idealistic).  Michael Douglas's character in real life would have sat there and ""would have waited for it to blow over"" (like John Kerry did when his patriotism was attacked in 2004), but as Kerry will attest to, this doesn't work.  It doesn't matter if Clinton (or any other president) is a ""good guy"" doing his best.  It depends on whether his best is good enough.  This film reduces politics to silliness, and while it would be nice if politics were this easy, it isn't, and we shouldn't pretend that it is.",2,Very naive and preachy...,1164844800,"11 30, 2006",2006,1454,"['When', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'obvious', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'character', 'was', 'based', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'Richard', 'Dreyfus', 'character', 'was', 'Bob', 'Dole', 'essential', 'message', 'was', 'President', 'good', 'guy', 'doing', 'best', 'should', 'give', 'break', 'Then', 'Dreyfus', 'playing', 'Bob', 'Dole', 'attacked', 'morals', 'Republicans', 'have', 'none', 'had', 'girlfriend', 'burned', 'flag', 'protest', 'youth', 'Dreyfus', 'continually', 'Douglas', 'finally', 'up', 'then', 'everything', 'fine', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'very', 'preachy', 'film', 'even', 'was', 'something', 'generally', 'agree', 'did', 'vote', 'Clinton', 'not', 'great', 'enthusiasm', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'films', 'preach', 'never', 'get', 'message', 'end', 'up', 'very', 'heavy', 'handed', 'film', 'rather', 'naive', 'simplistic', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'consider', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'wrote', 'West', 'Wing', 'horrible', 'show', 'too', 'naive', 'idealistic', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'character', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'sat', 'would', 'have', 'waited', 'blow', 'over', 'John', 'Kerry', 'did', 'when', 'patriotism', 'was', 'attacked', '2004', 'Kerry', 'will', 'attest', ""n't"", 'work', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Clinton', 'other', 'president', 'good', 'guy', 'doing', 'best', 'best', 'good', 'enough', 'film', 'politics', 'silliness', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'politics', 'were', 'easy', ""n't"", 'should', ""n't"", 'pretend']",The American President VHS

However, as for its politics, the film's mischaracterizations, political straw men, distortions and outright lies left me extremely frustrated.  One small example: the ACLU is not ""an organization dedicated to defending the Bill of Rights"" as President Shephard claims at the end of the movie.  When was the last time the ACLU came out to defend the second amendment, or the ninth, or tenth?Some people say that you have to separate this film's politics from the romantic comedy aspect.  Why?  Aaron Sorkin clearly intended it to be a political tract, allbeit gift wrapped and tied with a bow; he clearly didn't intend for it just to be another romantic comedy about, oh, two competing shopkeepers on the Upper West Side.  He had a point to make, he made it, and his film should be taken as such.I've heard that TAP became the blue print for the West Wing, which makes sense.  It doesn't take a shroom trip to make the connection between the two.  What can you say about TAP as opposed to WW?  Well, the lighting's better.  The tone is lighter.  The president is portrayed by less of a freak.  I think.I know conservatives who badmouth TAP, based on its obvious pro-liberal slant and shilling for Clinton, who was president at the time (of course, Clinton was married, while the fictitious Shephard was a widower, but liberals never let marital status stand in the way of romance).  There's something to be said for that angle, but in retrospect I think that conservatives should be more generous to the film.  Particularly as it relates to gun control, this movie and countless TV shows helped ossify the liberal thinking about guns, which more than any other factor lost West Virginia for Gore in 2000, which... well, you remember.",2,I've seen worse,1107734400,"02 7, 2005",2005,1850,"['When', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'enjoyed', 'parts', 'great', 'acting', 'writing', 'winsome', 'characters', 'However', 'politics', 'film', 'mischaracterizations', 'political', 'straw', 'men', 'distortions', 'outright', 'lies', 'left', 'extremely', 'frustrated', 'One', 'small', 'example', 'ACLU', 'not', 'organization', 'dedicated', 'defending', 'Bill', 'Rights', 'President', 'Shephard', 'end', 'movie', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'ACLU', 'came', 'out', 'defend', 'second', 'amendment', 'ninth', 'tenth', 'people', 'say', 'have', 'separate', 'film', 'politics', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'aspect', 'Why', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'clearly', 'intended', 'be', 'political', 'tract', 'allbeit', 'gift', 'wrapped', 'tied', 'bow', 'clearly', 'did', ""n't"", 'intend', 'just', 'be', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'oh', 'two', 'competing', 'shopkeepers', 'Upper', 'West', 'Side', 'had', 'point', 'make', 'made', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'such.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'TAP', 'became', 'blue', 'print', 'West', 'Wing', 'sense', ""n't"", 'take', 'shroom', 'trip', 'make', 'connection', 'two', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'about', 'TAP', 'opposed', 'WW', 'Well', 'lighting', 'better', 'tone', 'lighter', 'president', 'portrayed', 'less', 'freak', 'think.I', 'know', 'conservatives', 'who', 'badmouth', 'TAP', 'based', 'obvious', 'pro-liberal', 'slant', 'shilling', 'Clinton', 'who', 'was', 'president', 'time', 'course', 'Clinton', 'was', 'married', 'fictitious', 'Shephard', 'was', 'widower', 'liberals', 'never', 'let', 'marital', 'status', 'stand', 'way', 'romance', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'angle', 'retrospect', 'think', 'conservatives', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'generous', 'film', 'Particularly', 'gun', 'control', 'movie', 'countless', 'TV', 'shows', 'helped', 'ossify', 'liberal', 'thinking', 'guns', 'more', 'other', 'factor', 'lost', 'West', 'Virginia', 'Gore', '2000', 'well', 'remember']",The American President VHS

The chemistry between Michael Douglas and Annette Bening is very real and the dialog is fresh, snappy and inventive (especially the scene where Bening is trashing the president, unaware he is standing right behind her).  Michael Douglas is able to bring the presidency down to a  human level, showing the internal struggles he has to do what is right  versus what is popular; it makes me want to right him is as a write-in  candidate this November.  Richard Dreyfuss is deliciously evil as Bob  Rumson and easily brings to mind several modern senators from both  parties.This movie also highlights a flaw in our modern presidency that  wasn't evidenced until Clinton's impeachment: every aspect of the President  is under public scrutiny.  The term &quot;personal life&quot; is an  oxymoron, and his enemies will use the slightest thing to discredit him.  Even if you disagree with the liberal politics, I think everybody agrees  that the president's press conference near the end should be watched by not  only Pres. Clinton but by all of his successors and taken to heart.The  sets themselves are phenomenal.  After seeing the film I took a tour of the  White House and realized just how accurate they were.  Even the Secret  Service agents standing guard confirmed that the sets of most of the  mansion were highly accurate.

The American President was one of them.  I must have seen it twenty times.  We loved it, and I considered it a truly great movie.... then I grew up.  We watched it in my government class because our teacher was sick, and I noticed with horror... that this guy, the man we're supposed to be rooting for, is a Democrat!  He defends ACLU, he is for ""gun control,"" he cavorts around with environmental lobbyists!  How can I root for someone who stands against all of my core beliefs?  Then, not only that, the guy who shares MY beliefs, the Republican, is totally demonized.  He is old and stodgy and Michael Douglas constantly makes fun of him.  Which, I guess looking back, is the good ol' liberal way of handling people who know what they're talking about.And THEN there's the romance.  Now, okay, widower President dating is one thing.  But President putting off going to stop an airline strike to go buy flowers for his girlfriend?  President not doing ANYTHING to assure the public that their relationship would not affect anything he did?  President NEVER giving ANY addresses whatsoever, not even when freaking bombing Libya?  And not only this, but the girl he is seeing is a LOBBYIST (environmental too, BLECH).  Whenever his cabinet members were discussing important matters, all he would ask is things like ""Do you think she likes me?""  He was more concerned with this hot redhead than matters of state.  Mr. President, what you do behind closed doors is your own business, but when you let it get you distracted when you are the leader of our FREAKING COUNTRY it gets a little out of hand.  Oh, and this girl burned the flag once.  Y'know, the American flag.  And Mr. Democrat President DEFENDS her.  We're supposed to sympathize with them.  I can't.  I tried, but I can't.  We're supposed to be like ""OMG THOSE EVIL REPUBLICANS!  Yeah, why AREN'T you a member of the ACLU?  And why WON'T you support this ban on fossil fuels?  And WHY are you arming our druglords with your evil second amendment!  FOR SHAME!""  I don't know about you guys, but I just.. can't.I'll miss this movie, I really will.  But maybe they should have tried less to force leftist ideals down my throat, and tried harder to win me over to the love story.  And maybe made the President seem a little more than a lovesick teenager.  Like when he asks his Sec of State who talked with Sydney on the phone: ""Did she say anything about me?""  And, exasperated, he says ""No, but I'll ask her before study hall!""

450721,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,6305132666,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[2, 2]","By casting Martin Sheen (eventually to play President Josiah Bartlett) as White House Chief of Staff to President Andrew Shepard played by Michael Douglas, Adam Sorkin perfectly presages his THE WEST WING in this intelligently written romantic comedy also starring Annette Bening. Although she isn't one of my favorite actresses she plays the role of Sydney Ellen Wade, environmental lobbyist and girlfriend to the widowed President, with panache.This was one of my father's favorite films and he watched it every time it was on Cable, which is to say about eight hundred times. It was so ubiquitous on the family TV that I avoided it on purpose, which is a regret since it is very entertaining. Michael Douglas is very Presidential and his staff (including Michael J. Fox, who was to go on and star in SPIN CITY) bring a solidity to the film which makes it believable.President Shepard meets Wade at a function, and eventually calls her after Sheen and everybody else reduces the idea of his dating any woman to a poll projection. ""You'll lose five points; at least,"" Sheen cautions. Douglas isn't deterred. At first Wade thinks the call is from a friend playing a practical joke, and tells the President, ""You have a cute @$$,"" but after a hilarious moment where he asks her to call him back in the Oval Office, the game is afoot. Their first kiss is interrupted when the President is called away to order a retaliatory strike on a warlike Libya.Shepard loses more than five points. He loses about twenty-five, especially after the public is told that Wade has been spending nights at the White House. The staff go into battle mode, but Shepard, for his part, seems moon-eyed and oblivious to the criticism. ""How do you want to address the Sydney problem, sir?"" Fox asks him at one point, to which Douglas responds, ""When you say that you'd better mean a trade disagreement with Australia.""The popular President's numbers continue to tumble, and key legislation is endangered as votes evaporate. The flames are fanned by Shepard's nemesis, Senator Bob ""I'm running for President"" Rumson, an arch-Conservative and leader of what might be the Tea Party. Richard Dreyfuss, who plays Rumson, might have been inspired by a study of Senator John McCain or perhaps McCain was inspired by a study of Dreyfuss in this role. Rumson is intelligent, knowledgeable, and politically powerful; he certainly believes in his cause. But Rumson, much like Sarah Palin, is a mean-spirited and vitriolic human being who courts votes by avoiding any real debate, and appealing to Family Values and The Flag. He spends an inordinate amount of time denigrating the ""First Mistress."" In his constant carping on negatives and his propensity for unbridled personal attacks, Rumson reduces everything to the lowest common denominator.Shepard ignores Rumson to the point where his Presidency is at risk. No less at risk is his relationship with Sydney, which has blossomed into true love. Belatedly realizing that he must respond to what has become an overwhelmingly negative perception of himself as passive, Shepard comes out swinging in one of the best-written faux Presidential addresses ever filmed.Although we don't see the result, the implication is that Shepard's forceful reason undoes Rumson. We are also left with the delightful prospect of a White House Wedding.Although this is a romantic comedy, it has surprising depth and prescience in its handling of the declining state of American politics and the mindset of the electorate toward its leaders and toward what the nation truly stands for.",4,"""Call her.""",1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,3579,"['casting', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'eventually', 'play', 'President', 'Josiah', 'Bartlett', 'White', 'House', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'President', 'Andrew', 'Shepard', 'played', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Adam', 'Sorkin', 'perfectly', 'THE', 'WEST', 'WING', 'intelligently', 'written', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'also', 'starring', 'Annette', 'Bening', ""n't"", 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'role', 'Sydney', 'Ellen', 'Wade', 'environmental', 'lobbyist', 'girlfriend', 'widowed', 'President', 'panache.This', 'was', 'one', 'father', 'favorite', 'films', 'watched', 'time', 'was', 'Cable', 'say', 'eight', 'hundred', 'times', 'was', 'so', 'ubiquitous', 'family', 'TV', 'avoided', 'purpose', 'regret', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'very', 'Presidential', 'staff', 'including', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'who', 'was', 'go', 'star', 'SPIN', 'CITY', 'bring', 'solidity', 'film', 'believable.President', 'Shepard', 'meets', 'Wade', 'function', 'eventually', 'Sheen', 'everybody', 'else', 'idea', 'dating', 'woman', 'poll', 'projection', ""'ll"", 'lose', 'five', 'points', 'least', 'Sheen', 'cautions', 'Douglas', ""n't"", 'deterred', 'first', 'Wade', 'call', 'friend', 'playing', 'practical', 'joke', 'President', 'have', 'cute', '@', 'hilarious', 'moment', 'where', 'call', 'back', 'Oval', 'Office', 'game', 'afoot', 'first', 'kiss', 'interrupted', 'when', 'President', 'called', 'away', 'order', 'retaliatory', 'strike', 'warlike', 'Libya.Shepard', 'more', 'five', 'points', 'twenty-five', 'especially', 'public', 'told', 'Wade', 'been', 'spending', 'nights', 'White', 'House', 'staff', 'go', 'battle', 'mode', 'Shepard', 'part', 'moon-eyed', 'oblivious', 'criticism', 'How', 'do', 'want', 'address', 'Sydney', 'problem', 'sir', 'Fox', 'one', 'point', 'Douglas', 'When', 'say', ""'d"", 'better', 'mean', 'trade', 'disagreement', 'Australia', 'popular', 'President', 'numbers', 'continue', 'tumble', 'key', 'legislation', 'endangered', 'votes', 'evaporate', 'flames', 'are', 'fanned', 'Shepard', 'nemesis', 'Senator', 'Bob', ""'m"", 'running', 'President', 'Rumson', 'arch-Conservative', 'leader', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'Tea', 'Party', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'who', 'Rumson', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'inspired', 'study', 'Senator', 'John', 'McCain', 'perhaps', 'McCain', 'was', 'inspired', 'study', 'Dreyfuss', 'role', 'Rumson', 'intelligent', 'knowledgeable', 'politically', 'powerful', 'certainly', 'cause', 'Rumson', 'much', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'mean-spirited', 'vitriolic', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'courts', 'votes', 'avoiding', 'real', 'debate', 'appealing', 'Family', 'Values', 'Flag', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'time', 'denigrating', 'First', 'Mistress', 'constant', 'carping', 'negatives', 'propensity', 'unbridled', 'personal', 'attacks', 'Rumson', 'everything', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator.Shepard', 'Rumson', 'point', 'where', 'Presidency', 'risk', 'less', 'risk', 'relationship', 'Sydney', 'blossomed', 'true', 'love', 'Belatedly', 'realizing', 'must', 'respond', 'what', 'become', 'overwhelmingly', 'negative', 'perception', 'passive', 'Shepard', 'out', 'swinging', 'one', 'best-written', 'faux', 'Presidential', 'ever', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'result', 'implication', 'Shepard', 'forceful', 'reason', 'undoes', 'Rumson', 'are', 'also', 'left', 'delightful', 'prospect', 'White', 'House', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'surprising', 'depth', 'prescience', 'handling', 'declining', 'state', 'American', 'politics', 'mindset', 'electorate', 'leaders', 'what', 'nation', 'truly']",The American President VHS

450728,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6305132666,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[30, 34]","Okay, to weigh in on the key points of discussion that keep popping up with regards to this particular romantic comedy.  First, I would have liked ""West Wing"" if I had never seen ""The American President"" and I would have liked ""The American President"" even if it was not a test balloon for ""The West Wing.""  Second, of course a romantic comedy about the President of the United States is going to have a liberal in the White House.  Conservatives are either (a) not that funny or (b) do not like to be laughed at, take your pick.  Third, the part that bugs me the most is the ""character"" issue everybody keeps alluding to.  I know part of the premise of this movie is ""What is Hillary died and Bill Clinton was all alone in the White House and Chelsea was giving him dating tips?"", but does that automatically mean we have to give all his sexual foibles to the fictional Andrew Shepherd?  The man says he has only loved two women in his life and that it has been a long time since he has done anything sexual, so what is this character issue?  Somebody explain it to me...like I was a six year old.The actual plot of ""The American President"" is as old as the hills: boy becomes President, boy meets girl, boys falls for girl, girl falls for boy, and the entire country has an opinion.  But ultimately the story does not matter because we stop flipping through the channels when we come to this movie on television because of the snappy dialogue and the excellent acting performances.  Somehow screenwriter Aaron Sorkin got from ""A Few Good Men"" and ""Malice,"" to this choice piece of political drama.  Michael Douglas turns in his best romantic comedy performance as President Andrew Shepherd while Annette Bening plays Sydney Ellen Wade, a paid political lobbyist who discovers she has more of the President of the United States than his ear.But ultimately ""The American President"" features one of those ensemble casts that makes you sit and shake your head in wonder.  Actually, it is rather depressing to think that the actual occupants of the West Wing are no where as smart or as glib as this crew: Martin Sheen (""Come, friends, let us away""), Anna Deavere Smith (""I think the important thing is not to make it look like we're panicking""), Samantha Mathis (""Sir, I don't understan?""), and David Paymer (""Well, I could explain it better, but I'd need charts, and graphs, and an easel""), and in my choice for the best performance of his career, Michael J. Fox (""Can I just state very clearly I can't be part of anything illegal"").Did I mention the dialogue is really good in this film?  However, the film's only Oscar nomination was for Original Musical score.  Go figure.Personally, I do not think the American people would turn upon a widowed President who started dating.  But then I have this pesky idealistic streak that refuses to go away.  This is a witty, literate romantic-comedy that harkens back to Hollywood's golden age.  Ultimately the film's political leanings have little to do with our enjoyment because we know nothing ever happens with issues like gun control and fuel emissions in the real world and Bob Rumson's problem is not that he is running for President but that he is trying to break up the romance between these two kids.Most Romantic Lines: (1) ""Well, first of all, the two hundred pairs of eyes aren't focused on me. They're focused on you. And the answers are Sydney Ellen Wade, and because she said yes.""  (2) ""Perhaps I didn't properly explain the fundamentals of the slowdown plan.""  (3) ""I've loved two women in my life. I lost one to cancer and I lost the other because I was too busy keeping my job to do my job. Well, that ends right now.""

The director said we were going to watch it, and I was like, &quot;Oh, great, this is gonna put me to sleep.&quot;Well, it didn't put me to sleep.  In fact, I was glued to the screen from beginning to end.The first thing I remember thinking was, &quot;Man, Michael Douglas just had the greatest lines.&quot;  And he did - he had a witty comeback for everything that was thrown at him.  And when he wasn't being witty, such as when he is addressing his character towards the end of the film, it is still great writing.  Aaron Sorkin, the writer of the movie, should win an award for &quot;Best Lines&quot; or something.Every character in the film gives a great performance.  Annette Bening is as great in this film as she is in &quot;American Beauty.&quot;  I just loved how her character was vulnerable one minute, sexy the next, and then sharp as a whip later.  The supporting cast also deserves kudos for rounding out this great film.  Michael J. Fox (an early childhood favorite of mine) gets the &quot;Silent Hero&quot; award because even though he was not a major factor in the film, he uses what he's given to his fullest extent.  His showdown with Douglas towards the end of the film about Douglas' character is great.  Also to be commended are Martin Sheen, Anna Deavere Smith, David Paymer, and Richard Dreyfuss, who perfectly plays the snot-nosed Republican only looking out for his own personal political gain.In what I thought was going to be a sleeper, &quot;The American President&quot; is anything but.

Under Rob Reiner's astute direction, THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT is marvelous entertainment, a chick flick to be sure, but still a film that anyone can enjoy.  Michael Douglas gives one of his finest performances as the President, a widower with a conscience and a sense of humor.  He falls for an environmental lobbyist, played with skill and finesse by a radiant Annette Bening.  His character is attacked by an uncredited Richard Dreyfuss who plans to use this relationship to defeat Douglas in the upcoming election.  Without the talent of creator Sorkin and the director/cast, this could have been a treacly maudln mismash.  But it's oh so good.

Liberalism plagues this movie from top to bottom.  The president's love interest is an environmental lobbyist who is trying to slow down our economy by imposing a 20% reduction in fossil fuels.  The president opposes any changes in the educational laws, suggesting that tampering with educational experiments would be turning our back on public education.  (Well, I suppose public education has to win at the expense of school children!The president does not support the 20% reduction -- not because it's bad for the economy -- but rather, because it's unpopular!

450758,AVVXC6B1O3CLU,6305132666,Milkyway Movie Lover,"[8, 9]","A wonderful 5 star movie, so why would I give it only one star? Please let me enlighten you before you run out and buy it on DVD. I watched this movie for years on a VHS and adored it, it's one of my favs. more on that later, first you want to hear my warning. Now that I invested in a wonderful Plasma HDTV I found I needed the higher resolution DVDs and began replacing my entire 2000 movie collection. as another person who also tells you about the lousy DVD trasnfer said, it isn't anamorphic, and basicqally it means everything when you are talking about a great picture versus a lousy one with pixels showing, making every edge of everything constantly distracting with the way they seem alive, kind of reflective and moving,,, but we dont want the edge of the desk to move. they dont move in real life, they are hard straight edges of hard wood. in an ANAMORPHIC transfer the edges are crisp and clear and everything is beautiful, even a delivery truck on a street is actually fun to look at because its so darn clear and amazing to see! the faces of the actors are made ugly, litterally. I am not exaggerating. faces are so pixelated its completely distracting! The people becomd tiny due to the overly wide format, but you cant click your zoom to get closer because that just shows the bad effect even more pronounced! it sucks! I kid you not! so, seeing this and being made so upset here's what I did; I plugged in my VCR AND my DVD player,,,, mind you I use an OPPO which i also bought here on Amazon, so you know I was getting more from the DVD than it actually has to offer,,, they optomize the resolution,,, but even with it's help the VHS actually was better to watch, more enjoyable, clearer, closer larger faces, just plain more fun to watch.  I just paid $11 for a used DVD in mint condition through Amazon's used movie section and ended up watching it on my old VHS. WOW!~~! when given the choice I actually watched the entire movie from my old VHS and put the DVD BACK ON THE SHELF!  I hope you are hearing me folks because its the truth.  I wasted every penny I'd spent on the DVD. now just so you know i'm not just full of bad beans,,, of my 2000 movies I own, only this one DVD actually sucks like this.  There are older movies that arent anamorphic either that were put out on DVD that I also bought and played and though they also arent high resolution, they werent all pixelated like this one is and they were still enjoyable and very watchable.  only this one is of such a poor video transfer that I had to write all this about it, only this one!! and thats the truth!!!  Do yourself a favor if you havent seen this movie yet, buy it, but not on DVD. Go buy a cheap priced VHS on ebay for $1 usually (plus shipping) its cheap because so many were sold due to its so good. but wait to buy it on DVD until they fix this awful crime. they really screwed us over with this crapola low quality DVD,,, its as if they got it directly from a VHS and stretched it to fit the larger screens without giving it the additional resolution to make it look as good. SOoooooo,,, the only way to get them to fix crimes like this, is if everyone will give it a one star rating until they fix the problem, and apologize for screwing us of our money,,, its so bad they should send a new DVD to anyone sending in an old crappy version, the one now available! I hope you take me seriously, if I could I would mail you both my DVD and my VHS so you can see for yourself. I bet you could even tell the difference if I took pics of the movie on pause at the exact same part in the movie and had you all compare them.  I am so dissappointed I cant watch this great movie any more, until they undo the damage and re-make it. it just sucks I will have to buy it a third time, there should be a law against this kind of junk happening to us, arent we American citizens? dont we deserve better? a seperate agency from the movie industry should police these DVDs and give them a 1-5 rating of the DVD transfer so people could avoid ones like this, and this one is the worst one there is. Amazingly I read online where it doesnt really cost them hardly any more money to produce a movie anamorphically, its just a different setting on the equipment when they do it. really makes you wonder how ANY movie is sold if it isnt anamorphic. the highly informative story I read online compared it to the ""GOOD HOUSE-KEEPING SEAL OF APPROVAL"" on an apliance, the way it was in the old days, you would remember this if you are old enough. I'm 53 so I know how we used to look to see that tag on the cord before we bought the junky one that was going to spark and not work a week later. Also amazingly, I have old movie made many years ago that are anamorphic and they look fabulous! How could they ruin a great movie like this one???? and no one does anything about it???  I would think Michael Douglas and Annette Bening would be pounding on doors shouting at the people responsible and make them fix it. does anyone have Michael's phone number?  ummm, maybe you better send me Annette's number instead, she is soooo dreamy, lol. I'm pretty sure I'd rather talk to her any day, you ladies can call Michael, lol.",1,"Great Movie, Disgusting DVD of low visual quality",1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,5197,"['wonderful', '5', 'star',

450769,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,6305132666,Nix Pix,"[15, 17]","&quot;The American President&quot; was a script idea floating around Hollywood since the late 1970's.  Originally entitled, &quot;The President Elopes&quot; it was first conceived as a flat out farce and then a melodrama before falling into the capable hands of director, Rob Reiner in the early 1990's.  Retitled and rewritten, the resulting film, about what would happen if a widowed President decided to date a political activist, the film emerged as a touching, sentimental and witty romantic comedy that warmed the heart and endeared itself in the mind. As President Andrew Sheppard, Michael Douglas is simply amazing.  Annette Benning is a sensation as his girlfriend, Sidney Ellen-Wade.  Nice cameos from Martin Sheen, David Paymer and Michael J. Fox round out this stellar cast.Unfortunately there's nothing stellar about the DVD transfer from Warner Brothers. It's not anamorphic and is riddled with the kind of excessive digital grain and anomolies that one can't fathom from a major player like Warner Home Video.  Aliasing, shimmering of fine details, excessive edge enhancement and extreme digital tiling create a visual image that is gritty, harsh and overpowering on the eyes.  Colors can be well balanced and at other times quite smeared.  The soundtrack has been remastered to 5.1 surround but one wonders why the extra effort was taken, considering how badly the rest of the film looks.  THERE ARE NO EXTRAS!  Bottom line: Don't waste your time or money.  The good news - since this release Warner Video has done a complete 180 degree turn about so we just might see a remastering effort of this title in the near future.

The predecessor to ""The West Wing"" (seriously, see how many plot points are later repeated in that show), this film stars Michael Douglas as a father, widower, resident of Wisconsin, card-carrying member of the ACLU, member of the Democractic Party, and...oh yeah, President of the United States.  Facing an approaching re-election, a fierce Republican rival, a crime bill headed for Congress, a state dinner with the President of France, problems with the Middle East, and a possible love interest, played by Annette Bening, the man's day is certainly never boring...and neither is this film.  Michael Douglas comes off as a likable guy, so it's no wonder that he enters this film under high regard and respect.  Unfortunetly, his desire to keep his job (who doesn't have that these days) soon interfears with all that high regard and respect stuff and the White House staff find themselves on shakey grounds.  Annette Bening's character is definetly more focused as she fights to save the envierment and hopes to get the president's support for such a plan.  Though a deal is struck, both characters have a lot of work ahead of them and will have their character and marols tested along the way.

It had a poor image but was that was very common as DVDs were first coming to the marketplace.  The two followup releases have claimed to be ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN TV...BUT WERE NOT.  One version had an outer sleave that claimed this, but the actual case did not while the most recent version puts ENHANCED right on the disc insert.  Both of these version are the same old version previously released.  I would like to believe that this is a mistake, but it occurs too often for this to be true.

450805,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6305132666,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 5]","Politcally slick, but immensely enjoyable, more so than its more serious and less romantic version - ""The Contender"". In this flick, Michael Douglas plays Andy Schepard, Hollywood's version of the perfect president - a center-left people-pleaser who doesn't let his Stanford education (under a nobel-prize winning economist) or his perfect grades get between him and the soul of the American people. The movie starts off with his presidency on a high note - with the state of the union address in the offing, Schepard's enjoying unprecedented approval ratings, and we can immediately sense why - he's smart and surrounds himself with a staff of fast talking, fast thinking wiseguys.  A widower, Schepard he falls for Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Benning), a shark of a consultant who works for a DC-based lobby committed to environmental protection. Mixing politics and pleasure, Schepard courts Wade even as he pushes for Congress to pass groundbreaking legislation Wade's lobby has been seeking for years. The president's foes (arch conservatives in the fatcat mold) seize on the affair as a way to take down the popular President and the liberal causes.  Conscious but apathetic to the minds of Americans who don't approve of the widowed Chief's extra-marrital romancing (of a liberal, no less), the all-too decent Schepard remains silent about his relationship, determined not to let the business of statesmanship become bogged down by meaningless debates about ""character"" - even as both become touch-stones of the vile neo-conservative Bob Rumson (Richard Dreyfuss, in a thankless role). Although the script plays up the idea that the president's private life is his own, it also blurs the lines between Schepard's and Wade's two relationships (lovers on the one hand, president-to-lobbyist on the other) making it impossible to separate the Chief's private life with his public existence and compounding the problem by having Schepard propose a complex deal with Benning under which he will push for her environmental protection bill if she can guarantee enough support for it. Schepard is under pressure to pass his own pet-bill, a deceptively revolutionary anti-crime package, but figures that he can sell Congress on his bill and Sydney's if she can guarantee enough support for her own. When Schepard's romance so erodes his popularity that he'd be hard-pressed to pass either bill alone (even when Sydney fullfills her half of the deal, and signs on a hated triumvirate of auto-industry pols behind her environmental bill), the President finds himself in a deep dilemma that touches on his love for Wade and his duty to his office.Liberal wish fulfillment? Not a doubt. The film is also incredibly disengenuous - positing Rumson at the center of a bunch of fatcat republicans who sip brandy while considering the unprincipled ends to which they will use Wade against Schepard, as if they had nothing more appropriate to use against him.  (The film summarily dismisses Rumson and fellow right-wingers as backward political hacks who go for the jugular and base their popularity on the votes of older nostalgic Americans.) The biggest cheat is Schepard's staunch unwillingness to confront the vile Bob Rumson directly on the ""character"" issue. ""American"" is a film about politicians, but it's not really all that political - it touches on issues like fossil-fuel emissions, flag burning  and Uzis bought by 8 year olds not so much to deal with them as to remind us where each of the characters stood.  Since the film is largely if surprisingly apolitical the character issue is pretty much the only real nugget the script has. By keeping Schepard silent on that subject until the end of the movie, the script saves both sides the trouble of really tearing to pieces the question of whether a president can sleep with the proponents of legislation pending in Congress without raising a few well-reasoned doubts. By then, there's only one side given adequate time to really deal with that question (which one, you ask?)  Instead, the script's GOP, the brandy-sipping fatcats, never utter a word about gun-control, abortion, church-state separation, corporate welfare or the environment - something even liberals can't believe. While Schepard prefers to ignore ""the character issue"", the script immediately hits upon it - sure to remind us of his top-flight education (his ""Stepford Child"" grades), his integrity, his honest-to-goodness honesty and how much everybody seems to like him. All of our heroes are smart and funny, and even the slings and arrows of political misfortune just roll of their backs.If the movie rises above its lefty addictions for even this right-wing fundamentalist, it's because it's west-wing wish fulfillment is pretty much unconcealed. Think of this flick as a liberal version of ""Red Dawn"" - a movie that doesn't so much change people's minds as reinforce what their minds were. Gun-control liberals can sit through that flick because they know going in that it's about a bunch of rural farm kids with guns staring down the Red Army; - ditto in ""President"" for card-carrying NRA members who get pretty much what they expected, politically speaking in any event. The clever repartee of its characters (especially David Paymer and Michael J. Fox as his consultants - one being fearless, the other seeing portents of doom everywhere) keeps the film from getting to heavy and messagey. Nor could the story be dismissed as apologia for the Lewinsky affair - with Wade's position as a lobbyist making her relationship with Schepard look more questionable (not less) than ""Monica-gate"". Schepard is no Bill Clinton, Sydney Ellen Wade is no Monica. In short, this is a flick even Bob Rumson can enjoy.",4,lefty wish fulfilment? Maybe.  Great romantic comedy?

Penola,"[14, 16]","With a bit more breezy charm and a little less office politics, this wonderfully warm and surprisingly enchanting romantic comedy resembles at first glance The West Wing, the current White House drama series on NBC.  Rob Reiner directs this handsome movie with a light touch, yet the movie  looks beautiful.

What happens next is pretty much predictable and standard fare but still a lot of fun to watch: the President promises Sydney to help pass her environmental bill, but at the same time he must pass a crime bill that will help him get re-elected. When it comes down to the wire, he chooses to focus on the crime bill instead, and shelves the environmental one. Not to worry though, because the President comes to his senses, and all ends well.Annette Bening is radiant in this role. She's glowing.

450817,AJDYDG7YZY9QL,6305132666,Stephen A. Haines,"[2, 3]","This film makes a serious effort to tackle a serious subject.  How far may the electorate  intrude on a public figure's private life?  Michael Douglas' role of Andrew Sheppard is a  modern reflection of Woodrow Wilson's nearly state-secret marriage in the latter days of his  presidency.  Douglas' portrayal reflects an equivalent political scene, as well.  Wilson  struggled with the biggest issue of his day, the League of Nations.  Sheppard is seeking  passage of environmental legislation.  Both, confronted with the need to compromise, are in  vulnerable positions.  As so often with American politics, the public are led by unscrupulous  politicians to overlook serious issues and target incumbents with tainted personal  considerations.  Wilson scandalized America with his marriage.  Even later historians credited  Mrs Wilson with forcing policies she favoured through an ill, weakened president.Douglas carries his role quite suitably.  He's a far cry from the austere Wilson, portraying  Sheppard with a Kennedyesque panache.  He amply demonstrates what a president must  endure in having vital legislation adopted.  The &quot;Crime Bill&quot; episode is reminiscent of the  Kennedy brothers' efforts to curb Mafia power in the 1960s.There is just enough of the daughter's presence to keep that issue before us, but the apparent  limited age distance between her and Bening makes one wonder what this would to after the  Banns are published.  Douglas' initial efforts to court Bening superbly demonstrate the  constraints the world's most powerful figure operates in, the florist call being one of the finer  sequences.  Reiner is able to balance the personal with the political.  Bening's presence is more  commanding than a legislative document, but her performance as a lobbyist is strong enough  to keep the real issue before us.  The screenplay falls just short of being truly expressive on  issues.  That may come, someday.Michael J. Fox and Martin Sheen [especially the latter] turn in strong performances as  presidential advisors.  Sheen is vividly realistic as the long-term counsel, but Fox comes  through in a climatic scene urging Sheppard to reverse an attitude.  Richard Dreyfuss,  however, turns in a very special performance as the petty-minded Kansas senator.  Whether  this is Reiner's personal assault on Bob Dole is irrelevant.  Reiner deftly exposes how low  American politics can sink in the hands of the uncaring.  The contrast is vividly displayed in  Douglas' lament over the innocent people he must destroy in exercising policy curbing  terrorism.  He carries it off with fine credibility.  In the last analysis, this is a film worth  having and re-viewing.  It has a timeless quality, reflecting the feeling of hope we once had  about what a human being a president could be.  Perhaps it will come again.",4,The loneliest job . . .,982454400,"02 18, 2001",2001,2843,"['film', 'serious', 'effort', 'tackle', 'serious', 'subject', 'How', 'far', 'may', 'electorate', 'intrude', 'public', 'figure', 'private', 'life', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'role', 'Andrew', 'Sheppard', 'modern', 'reflection', 'Woodrow', 'Wilson', 'nearly', 'state-secret', 'marriage', 'latter', 'days', 'presidency', 'Douglas', 'portrayal', 'equivalent', 'political', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'Wilson', 'struggled', 'biggest', 'issue', 'day', 'League', 'Nations', 'Sheppard', 'seeking', 'passage', 'environmental', 'legislation', 'confronted', 'need', 'compromise', 'are', 'vulnerable', 'positions', 'so', 'often', 'American', 'politics', 'public', 'are', 'led', 'unscrupulous', 'politicians', 'overlook', 'serious', 'issues', 'target', 'incumbents', 'tainted', 'personal', 'considerations', 'Wilson', 'scandalized', 'America', 'marriage', 'Even', 'later', 'historians', 'credited', 'Mrs', 'Wilson', 'forcing', 'policies', 'favoured', 'ill', 'weakened', 'president.Douglas', 'role', 'quite', 'suitably', 'far', 'cry', 'austere', 'Wilson', 'portraying', 'Sheppard', 'Kennedyesque', 'panache', 'amply', 'what', 'president', 'must', 'endure', 'having', 'vital', 'legislation', 'adopted', 'quot', 'Crime', 'Bill', 'quot', 'reminiscent', 'Kennedy', 'brothers', 'efforts', 'curb', 'Mafia', 'power', '1960s.There', 'just', 'enough', 'daughter', 'presence', 'keep', 'issue', 'apparent', 'limited', 'age', 'distance', 'Bening', 'one', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'Banns', 'are', 'published', 'Douglas', 'initial', 'efforts', 'court', 'Bening', 'superbly', 'demonstrate', 'constraints', 'world', 'most', 'powerful', 'figure', 'florist', 'call', 'being', 'one', 'finer', 'sequences', 'Reiner', 'able', 'balance', 'personal', 'political', 'Bening', 'presence', 'more', 'commanding', 'legislative', 'document', 'performance', 'lobbyist', 'strong', 'enough', 'keep', 'real', 'issue', 'screenplay', 'just', 'short', 'being', 'truly', 'expressive', 'issues', 'may', 'come', 'someday.Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'Martin', 'Sheen', '[', 'especially', 'latter', ']', 'turn', 'strong', 'performances', 'presidential', 'advisors', 'Sheen', 'vividly', 'realistic', 'long-term', 'counsel', 'Fox', 'climatic', 'scene', 'urging', 'Sheppard', 'reverse', 'attitude', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'however', 'very', 'special', 'performance', 'petty-minded', 'Kansas', 'senator', 'Reiner', 'personal', 'assault', 'Bob', 'Dole', 'irrelevant', 'Reiner', 'deftly', 'how', 'low', 'American', 'politics', 'can', 'sink', 'hands', 'uncaring', 'contrast', 'vividly', 'displayed', 'Douglas', 'lament', 'innocent', 'people', 'must', 'destroy', 'exercising', 'policy', 'curbing', 'terrorism', 'off', 'fine', 'credibility', 'last', 'analysis', 'film', 'worth', 'having', 're-viewing', 'timeless', 'quality', 'reflecting', 'feeling', 'hope', 'once', 'had', 'what', 'human', 'being', 'president', 'could', 'be', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'come', 'again']",The American President VHS

As a result, his popularity rating decreases in seven weeks to 41%.(3) Despite his now low popularity rating, the President continues with the relationship.Besides the romantic relationship that develops, we see the President's hard-working staff members (two of which are the chief of staff {Martin Sheen} and the senior domestic policy advisor {Michael J. Fox}), a senator (Richard Dreyfuss) who desperately wants the top job, state dinners, former protocol, informal moments, and global crises.The acting throughout is in a word: fantastic.  Kudos to Michael Douglas, Annette Bening, and Martin Sheen who, I felt, give above-average performances.  (This may have been Sheen's audition role for the popular TV series ""The West Wing."")  Michael J. Fox also gives a fine performance.This movie is well filmed.  The background music I heard was classical, ballet, and even some Rogers & Hammerstein.Some people may focus too much on the liberal politics presented in this movie.  This is a mistake.  The idea is to show how a romantic relationship can possibly fit into the grueling schedule of a President.  It explores the balance between private romance and public Presidency.Finally, the DVD (the one released in 1999) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has minimal extras.In conclusion, this movie is a romantic comedy and dramatic gem that attempts to answer a unique question:  what would happen if an unattached President got a girlfriend??(1995;  1 hr, 55 min;  wide screen;  33 scenes)+++++",5,"""The President's got a girlfriend!!""",1170115200,"01 30, 2007",2007,1851,"['+++++This', 'interesting', 'well-acted', 'sometimes', 'comical', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'technically', 'summed', 'up', '1', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'Andrew', 'Shepherd', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'who', 'widowed', 'daughter', 'popularity', 'rating', 'election', 'year', '63', '%', '2', 'girlfriend', 'political', 'strategist', 'Sydney', 'Ellen', 'Wade', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'result', 'popularity', 'rating', 'decreases', 'seven', 'weeks', '41', '%', '3', 'now', 'low', 'popularity', 'rating', 'President', 'relationship.Besides', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'see', 'President', 'hard-working', 'staff', 'members', 'two', 'are', 'chief', 'staff', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'senior', 'domestic', 'policy', 'advisor', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'senator', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'who', 'desperately', 'top', 'job', 'state', 'dinners', 'former', 'protocol', 'informal', 'moments', 'global', 'crises.The', 'acting', 'word', 'fantastic', 'Kudos', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'who', 'felt', 'give', 'above-average', 'performances', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Sheen', 'audition', 'role', 'popular', 'TV', 'series', 'West', 'Wing', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'also', 'fine', 'performance.This', 'movie', 'well', 'filmed', 'background', 'music', 'heard', 'was', 'classical', 'ballet', 'even', 'Rogers', 'Hammerstein.Some', 'people', 'may', 'focus', 'too', 'much', 'liberal', 'politics', 'presented', 'movie', 'mistake', 'idea', 'show', 'how', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'can', 'possibly', 'fit', 'grueling', 'schedule', 'President', 'balance', 'private', 'romance', 'public', 'Presidency.Finally', 'DVD', 'one', 'released', '1999', 'perfect', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'minimal', 'extras.In', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'dramatic', 'gem', 'answer', 'unique', 'question', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'unattached', 'President', 'got', 'girlfriend', '1995', '1', 'hr', '55', 'min', 'wide', 'screen', '33', 'scenes', '+++++']",The American President VHS

I wrote a screenplay a few years ago called &quot;A Murderous Campaign&quot;. It had all the elements of a great script. A beautiful porn star has an affair with a Democrat Louisiana Senator. She overhears him plotting the assassination of a political rival, but they find out she heard the plan. They try to kill her, so she goes into hiding and hooks up with a crusty old Washington reporter who is considered kooky because he has been accusing this Democrat of these crimes for years. A retired FBI friend of the reporter helps them. The Democrat announces a Presidential bid. The porn star uses her considerable charms and discovers that the Governor of New Jersey is the assassination target at a Statue of Liberty rally. She saves the Governor, and the plot is revealed, but the Democrat candidate goes into spin control. Nobody can really prove the plan. It looks like he will win the nomination, having weathered the politics of personal destruction. Finally, the porn girl and the reporter find the old father of the Democrat's chief of staff, a former Ku Klux Klansman who wants to get what he knows off his chest before passing from this mortal coil. He tells them about the drug smuggling operation the candidate has been running in the Louisiana Bayou. The reporter's FBI pal arranges a raid. They discover all the &quot;smoking gun&quot; evidence of a series of political murders going back years. The girl is re-united with her family, gets out of the porn business, the reporter wins the Pulitzer, and it is jail time for the Democrat. The end.Creative execs who loved the verbal pitch when I simply described the Democrat as a &quot;politician,&quot; a &quot;candidate&quot; or the &quot;Senator&quot; all passed when they read the part in the script that identifies him as an actual Democrat. Pamela Anderson would be perfect as the porn chick. I could see Denzel Washington as the reporter, and Gary Busey as the Democrat Senator. I was asked if I would change him to a Republican. My answer was that I wanted to maintain the realism of the story.

I have a feeling they intended to release a good version of this movie (anamorphic, etc.), but then decided not to for some reason.  Instead of cancelling the release (which is what they should have done), I guess they said ""Hey, we have tons of old stock in inventory.  Maybe we can repackage it with some gimmick like a Mother's Day card.""Honestly, I don't even think they make snap cases anymore.  I haven't seen a new release with a snap case in 2-3 years.  I also haven't seen any movie releases that don't have an anamorphic version in a couple years either.  This has to be old stock.Sometimes I really hate Warner Brothers.  I initially hated them because of the snap cases that they littered our collections with, now they sell old stock to fans that have been waiting years for an anamorphic version of this movie.The movie is great.  Maybe someday they will do it justice with a decent DVD release.Message to Warner Brothers:  We already purchased your crappy release of this great movie years ago.

450826,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,6305132666,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[6, 6]","Director:  Rob ReinerCast:  Michael Douglas, Annette Bening, Martin Sheen, Michael J. Fox, Anna Deavere Smith, Samantha Mathis, Shawna Waldron, David Paymer, Richard Dreyfuss.Running Time:  114 minutesRated PG-13 for some strong language.Rob Reiner's `The American President', is a refreshing look at the controversial and sometimes boring subject of politics. This movie also does more. It has a wonderful love story, with a very comedic feel, which is different to other romantic movies I have seen. I am sure that being `The President of the United States' is arduous task at the best of times. However this film gives a much different look at what it means to be the US president, in the public eye and in private as well.When US President Andrew Shepherd, quite unexpectedly, falls in love with Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist, he must overcome obstacles not faced by average citizens; he must worry that the public's right to know will collide with the desire for personal privacy. Political crises are different than personal ones and somehow the American President alone must find a way to balance time to do his job, for the love of his country with his love for an incredible woman.  It is obvious that this movie's main stars, that being Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas) and Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Benning), steal most of the limelight. There roles as politicians are so believable, it allows them to do so.  The film, with its continuous delightful humor and charm, manages to make light of relatively simple tasks for normal human beings who are not the president, such buying flowers or calling up a girl for a date, buth are thoroughly difficult for the Commander in Chief.The screenplay was well written for this movie by Aaron Sorkin, who does a stupendous job interwining the political tension amongst Shepherd and his nearest competitor (Richard Dreyfuss) and the relationship tension that occurs between the president and Wade.  The supporting cast for Douglas and Benning in `The American President' is first-class. A.J MacInerney (Martin Sheen) is the president's right-hand man, Lewis Rothschild (Michael J. Fox) is the president's conscience, with a brilliant scene of retaliating remarks between Douglas and Fox close to the end of the movie, Robin McCall (Anna Deavere Smith) is the press secretary, Leon Kodak (David Paymer) is his pollster and Janie Basdin (Samantha Mathis) is his personal secretary. I also enjoyed the role of the president's daughter `Lucy' (well played by Shawna Waldron). Her character had wisdom that her Father needed and was a good change to see from time to time.The political feel this film had was also a highlight, handling such issues as the environment via Sydney's character and gun control through the president character in the most professional way. The final speech of the president's, is an extremely powerful moment and one that shows a commanding presence from Douglas as the lead.  Directed flawlessly by Reinter, ""The American President"" is a romantic comedy that takes us away from the political corruption that surrounds our world and reminds us of the genuine good in people; even the president.  If you want to see a good night's entertainment, then `The American President' is the movie just for you.

450837,AUQAL4MV2CM2R,6305132666,"Warp Girl ""warpgirl""","[0, 0]","Okay let's be honest... Politics is a dirty business and idealism yields to the realities of power. But, underneath the reality no matter what politics people espouse, we ALL want love, we all want to see others to try and do good. That's what this movie is really about. Aaron Sorkin is a writing genius, he is what I wish I could do. Like his politics or hate them, (I personally don't care one way or the other) one must admit the man can write dialogue like no one else except Damon Runyon (maybe). The pace, the pitch, the right word at the right moment... I'm in awe every time. No wonder The West Wing is my favorite TV show ever, even after Sorkin left he created a monument to language and articulate speech, and this was the launching point. My only issue with this film is that I have to mute the F-word, really Mr. Sorkin, &#34;profanity is the crutch of the conversational cripple!&#34; I wish I could remember who said that quote.I think Rob Reiner, is one of those Directors who tells his actors, &#34;do what you do&#34; and points the camera where he needs it. That's the way I like it. In this film with Michael Douglas and Annette Benning did he need to do more? I don't think so! The casting couldn't be more perfect.You know, as much as I adore Mr. Douglas I've seen more of his father's films, then his. That said, he embodies everything that you want to see in his character. At times, he's stately and regal, at others charming and witty, at others decisive and even ruthless. But most of all, he's a good guy who wants to find love again. Really, you have to root for him.Annette Benning must have the most beautiful shoulders and neck on earth. Really, nobody looks better in a strapless gown. I love the fact that she's not a woman who goes through the movie proving herself to every man. Yes, she's in a man's world, (playing hardball with the most powerful man on the planet) but she's not shoving that fact down the audience's throat. She's smart, strong, and supremely capable. That's all she needs to be professionally, and it works. In her personal life she's very much like any other good woman, full of idiosyncrasies, vulnerabilities, warm, loving, and kind. In other words, a decent human being first, then a killer political operative. Bravo!Martin Sheen, (the future Jed Bartlet) was wonderful as the White House COS and you can see glimpses of the future in his role. Warm and wonderful, my only complaint is that it's too small! I would have loved a scene with him and Mr. Dreyfuss.Richard Dreyfuss as Senator Rumson, now I admit this movie makes the Republicans the bad guys, but when watching a movie who doesn't love a villain you love to hate? Seriously, half the fun in any fiction is hating the bad guy and Dreyfuss is AMAZING in a &#34;twirling Mustache&#34; role with his charisma and showmanship. He's honestly my second favorite character, completely brilliant!Michael J. Fox as Lewis Rothschild Okay he's my favorite! Lewis is the precursor to Josh Lyman of The West Wing, and I've got a thing for the &#34;doers&#34; he has one major scene where he just grabs the heart and squeezes it with all the talent he possesses.Most of the rest of the cast would find it's way on to the small screen in Sorkin's kingdom, and this movie shows you why. There isn't a single weak link here.All in all, this film gives 99.9% of people what they want in an underdog romantic comedy regardless of political ideology.

An intellectual, thinking, feeling patriot who is President because he believes in serving his country. Wow! What a concept!Now imagine this president being played by a terribly noble but very believable Michael Douglas, a presidential single father who lost his wife to cancer a few years back, and who has avoided any hint of dating since then. Enter environmental lobbyist Sydney Ellen Wade, playing charmingly by a sprightly and beautiful Annette Benning, and you have the beginnings of a romance reminiscent of the &quot;good old days&quot; of Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman.In these post-Monica days, it's hard to think of a president seriously courting and falling in love with a worthwhile and intelligent woman. The problems they encounter (inquisitive press, sniping by political adversaries) seem so tame in light of real life! But they are very real to this couple, and they are solved in a manner that still makes me sigh with pleasure.A word to the politically conservative: Although it is never stated, Michael Douglas's president is definitely not a Republican. And his chief adversary, played smarmingly by Richard Dreyfus, is the quintessential scary right-winger. The movie, however, mostly skirts politics and centers on the romance.

Too bad our country has been hijacked and the religious right have not only destroyed the infrastructure, they have also destroyed liberal help in restoring the constitution.  The constitution is based on liberty, but fascism has been the main course so long that liberals now ask how we win the war on drugs, instead of asking how to legalize drugs and stop wars.  The war on drugs is a failure.  Criminalizing anything presents problems.  When is prostitution the healthiest?  Where it is legal.  Drinking problems occur, prohibition made them infinitely worse.  How do we solve the war on drugs?  Legalize and tax them.  Take the crime out of the equation.  Gain tax revenue.  Learn healthier administration.  Stop people having to steal to gain access to drugs.  Stop over crowding of prisons.  Free up the legal system.  Stop drug dealers from having to kill.  Stop searches.  Stop undercover officers from risking their lives, etc..., etc...  Will drugs create problems?  Yes.  Will the problems be lessened ad infinitum?  Yes.  How do we solve the problem of second hand smoke.  Let owner's decide on smoking policies.  People that bought all the exaggerations and don't want to be bothered by second hand smoke can go to smoke free establishments.  People that don't care can go to smoking establishments.  The constitution is about liberty and movies like this make a sad case for politics to ignore the constitution.  Avoid this movie and make the liberal agenda to eliminate government control.  Live and let live.  Let people learn by their consequences and let this country stand for true liberty and abolish the republicans who spew the rhetoric of freedom while enacting slavery.
