A 1980 type family (mom, dad and son) with an adorable girl robot who takes everything to heart. So when you say ""Breakfast in bed"", Vici the robot tosses the meal in bed (By the way, that gag is in the pilot). The 1980's were know for that fish outta water characters and ideas. Such TV shows and movies like Alf, Holmes and Yoyo, Not Quite Human (Disney Channel movies), Automan and Wonder had that kind of fare. Sometimes is worked like Wonder and ALF.Sometimes it did not-like Holmes and YoyoHowever It is family fare that i liked and still do. It is simple and Disney-like in many ways. I wish there was more of it today.  The ahow is semi timeless.  The jokes are not forced. The cast is no majot names..However with a major names, it would spoil the fun.  It still runs today in some markets, including Retro TV cable TV stations.The commentary tracks with most of the cast (Tiffany Brissette and Emily Schulman are missing from any cast commentary) is a trip down memory lane. The commentary seems friendly, with limited insights into the show. However it is better than Shirley Jones on her Partridge family  DVD commentary. You also have the show promos if you want to  see it. I would rather watch the episode.If you like family fare, these 24 episodes of the syndicated series is worth watching. Someone remarked to me that there is tv shows or movies that the family can watch together. They say the Disney fare is more for tweens and not for adults.  I disagree I like some of the disney fare. This show is in the same vein..and I think  this show is a keeperBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD",5,Pure 80s Fun,1264809600,"01 30, 2010",2010,1703,"['got', 'early', 'review', 'copy', 'first', 'season', 'Small', 'Wonder', 'cute', '1980', 'idea', '1980', 'type', 'family', 'mom', 'dad', 'son', 'adorable', 'girl', 'robot', 'who', 'everything', 'heart', 'So', 'when', 'say', 'Breakfast', 'bed', 'Vici', 'robot', 'meal', 'bed', 'way', 'gag', 'pilot', '1980', 'were', 'know', 'fish', 'outta', 'water', 'characters', 'ideas', 'Such', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'Alf', 'Holmes', 'Yoyo', 'Not', 'Quite', 'Human', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'movies', 'Automan', 'Wonder', 'had', 'kind', 'fare', 'Sometimes', 'worked', 'Wonder', 'ALF.Sometimes', 'did', 'not-like', 'Holmes', 'YoyoHowever', 'family', 'fare', 'i', 'liked', 'still', 'do', 'simple', 'Disney-like', 'many', 'ways', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'today', 'ahow', 'semi', 'timeless', 'jokes', 'are', 'not', 'forced', 'cast', 'majot', 'names..However', 'major', 'names', 'would', 'spoil', 'fun', 'still', 'today', 'markets', 'including', 'Retro', 'TV', 'cable', 'TV', 'stations.The', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'most', 'cast', 'Tiffany', 'Brissette', 'Emily', 'Schulman', 'are', 'missing', 'cast', 'commentary', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'commentary', 'friendly', 'limited', 'insights', 'show', 'However', 'better', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'Partridge', 'family', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'also', 'have', 'show', 'promos', 'want', 'see', 'would', 'rather', 'watch', 'episode.If', 'family', 'fare', '24', 'episodes', 'syndicated', 'series', 'worth', 'watching', 'Someone', 'remarked', 'tv', 'shows', 'movies', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'together', 'say', 'Disney', 'fare', 'more', 'tweens', 'not', 'adults', 'disagree', 'disney', 'fare', 'show', 'same', 'vein..and', 'think', 'show', 'keeperBennet', 'Pomerantz', 'AUDIOWORLD']",Small Wonder: Season 1
642702,AMA6SPA2A43JH,B00005JOQZ,Cassie,"[2, 11]","Ted keeps saying Vicki is supposed to be a secret, but he keeps working on her inner circuits in front of an uncovered window. They know they have two snoops next door. Harriet who pops up at windows, seen and unseen, in almost every episode and Bonnie who uses Binnoculars. He should know better. In the first episode Ted said everyone should treat Vicki like a real child, but unless a real child is being abused, they don't live in cabinets. If he truly wants to treat her like a real child he should give her her own bedroom and toys. He claims to want Joan and Jamie to treat her like a real child, but when they do he reminds them she is a robot. If he wants to see how human she can become they, especially Ted, should treat her like a real child. Also the shows special effects. When there are special effects it looks like Vicki's not even in the room. When the bed went up it was obvious some kind of machine was putting it up. I know this was the 80's, but even shows from the 60's had better special effects. Shows like Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie's special effects looks real, like they could really be happening. Small Wonder's special effect don't. Lastthing is when you look outside it is obvious the scenery is painted. Outside nothing nis real.

I on the other hand only saw it for the first time this month (over 2 decades later). I was struck by how much I liked the show. In a way, it's like a mix ofFull HouseandIsaac Asimov. For the most part, it's a family sit-com with some of the usual dilemmas (son running away from home, annoying neighbors, etc). However, classic sci-fi themes about the boundary between robots and humanity arise frequently, giving the show a bit more intellectual juice. I also like the fact that the dad is a computer geek. In fact, he sometimes sounds like a character straight out of Asimov.Unfortunately,Small Wonderdoes suffer from its low budget. It isn't, as some allege, one of the worst sit-coms of all time. In fact, I think in a lot of ways, it was ahead of its time. But the acting and production quality are all very much low budget, making it seem antiquated today. The corny ""small wonder"" theme song doesn't help. I'm not sure we'll ever see a revival in Small Wonder. It's shame, because the show really has a lot of potential and, as far as I can remember, is the first (and only?) sci-fi sit-com.",4,A mix of Full House and Isaac Asimov,1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,1210,"['wife', 'grew', 'up', 'onSmall', 'Wonder', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'else', 'TV', 'Burma', 'loved', 'other', 'hand', 'only', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'month', '2', 'decades', 'later', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'show', 'way', 'mix', 'ofFull', 'HouseandIsaac', 'Asimov', 'most', 'part', 'family', 'sit-com', 'usual', 'dilemmas', 'son', 'running', 'away', 'home', 'annoying', 'neighbors', 'etc', 'However', 'classic', 'sci-fi', 'themes', 'boundary', 'robots', 'humanity', 'arise', 'frequently', 'giving', 'show', 'bit', 'more', 'intellectual', 'juice', 'also', 'fact', 'dad', 'computer', 'geek', 'fact', 'sometimes', 'character', 'straight', 'Asimov.Unfortunately', 'Small', 'Wonderdoes', 'suffer', 'low', 'budget', ""n't"", 'allege', 'one', 'worst', 'sit-coms', 'time', 'fact', 'think', 'lot', 'ways', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'acting', 'production', 'quality', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'low', 'budget', 'making', 'seem', 'antiquated', 'today', 'corny', 'small', 'wonder', 'theme', 'song', ""n't"", 'help', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'revival', 'Small', 'Wonder', 'shame', 'show', 'really', 'lot', 'potential', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'remember', 'first', 'only', 'sci-fi', 'sit-com']",Small Wonder: Season 1

Small Wonder is one that I never missed.  I can remember swimming at the local pond and thinking I have to get home Small Wonder is almost on!  The show which first aired in 1985 is about an inventor/ engineer named Ted who invents a robot that looks like a real ten year old girl.  He brings the robot home to live with him and his wife and son.  The robot, who they call Vicki attends school and somehow no one notices that she talks like a robot. When not spending time with the family, Vicki lives in her human brother Jamie's cabinet.  I'm not sure which season this episode is from,but there was one that I remember very well because it scared  me so much.  In the episode Ted invents a boy robot who go's to school with Vicki and Jamie.  No one can tell that the boy is a robot.  At some point they show the control panel in the boy's back. I was terrified after seeing this episode!  For a long time I would look in the mirror all the time looking for a control panel in my back!  I thought that because no one on the show knew that the boy was a robot maybe I was a robot and no one knows.  I was a very unusual kid who was scared of many, many things.

642718,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B00005JOQZ,JGC,"[51, 61]","As a huge fan of ""Small Wonder"", '80s TV and just silly family sitcoms in general I can't tell you how excited I am to have the Season 1 DVD set of this classic series.""Small Wonder"" revolved around the Lawson Family and Vicki; a Voice Input Child Identicant that was raised as a child. Vicki could get into mischief every once in a while which ended up being very funny only because it was so foolish. Also the series included lots of talented special effects which rarely (if ever) have been seen in a sitcom of this type. And, although Vicki had superhuman powers (she could lift a grown man off the ground with 1 hand), she was also very relatable because somehow she was always able to do something sentient in every ep.The star of the show was Tiffany Brissette, in the title-role. Tiffany played the robot-child perfectly because she was so real, or should I say unreal in each and every ep. Dick Christie and Marla Pennington were the parents, and Jerry Supiran was their son, Jamie. Rounding out the cast is Harriet (Emily Schulman), the Lawson's annoying neighbor and William Bogert and Eddie McClurg played her parents, Bonnie and Brandon Brindle.After watching this entire season I have some very important questions:Why does Joan's hair change from bob to cotton candy in every other ep?Why doesn't anyone ever notice that Vicki speaks in monotone?Why didn't Ted ever tell Brandon and Bonnie to bug off?Why does their house have 2 fireplaces yet only 2 bedrooms?Didn't Jamie ever get creeped out by having Vicki sleep in his cabinet?Did Reggie grow up to be the first black president?Did Harriet and Chrissy Snow share the same hairdresser?How happy was Edie McClurg when she left this show and got the ""Valerie"" gig?Why does Jamie always put his hands on his hips?If Ted invented Vicki to help children with special needs, then why did he adopt her and lie to everyone and decide to raise her as his daughter?Why was Joan required to get her teaching credential if she was just going to home-school Vicki?Why did Joan wear so many oversized outfits, sweaters and bulky belts?Why does Jamie have a rainbow colored gym bag?What was up with all of those microwave-sized things in Ted's makeshift closet/office?When Edie McClurg resurfaced on ""Melrose Place"" was her character, Hilda, really a long lost relative of Bonnie's?How exactly was Vicki able to shed tears?Who told Ken Berry that he could dance?Why does Jamie's ""clubhouse"" look like a mini shed (or an overzied doghouse) on stilts?Is Harriet the reason behind Cartman's aversion to gingers?Has there ever been another show that was more over-the-top and corny than ""Small Wonder""?As a child I used to watch ""Small Wonder"" every Saturday evening in first-run syndication on WNEW-5 (now it's known as Fox-5). The series used to come on in between ""What's Happening Now"" and ""Too Close For Comfort."" Gosh, can you get more 80's than that! Incidentally, ""Small Wonder"" became the #1 family sitcom in syndication during its initial run.This is a 4 disc collection (6 eps per disc) and it's packaged in slim plastic cases that fit into the bookcase-type cardboard container. Be sure to check out the pictures of everything (the discs, packaging and the covers of the 2 plastic cases) that I took the time to scan, label and post.The Season 1 set includes all 24 eps, complete and unedited for broadcast. Also, included on each disc are original episode promos for each show (these run just over 3 minutes total per disc).The main menu includes a picture of Vicki with the ""Small Wonder"" logo superimposed over the background (incidentally, the backgrounds on each disc are color coded) with a loop of the theme song. Each ep is exactly 22 minutes and 18 seconds long (from opening credits to closing credits)Disc One:Vicki's Homecoming (original airdate: 9-7-85)In the premiere of this classic sitcom we meet the entire Lawson family, including Ted's latest creation; Vicki. One of my favorite parts is in the very beginning when Jamie slams the door in Harriet's face and says that she's ""a pill"" and a ""waste of womanhood.""- w/ commentary with Howard Leeds (the creator/producer), Dick Christie, Marla Pennington & Jerry SupiranThe Neighbors (original airdate: 9-14-85)The Brindles barge their way into the Lawsons, inviting themselves over for dinner. As Dick Christie said in one of the commentaries, they were very food motivated. Get a load of Harriet's ""robot"" Rodney. And notice how Vicki mentions Google a quarter of a century before it becomes a household word, ""the word gargle is not in my memory bank, but I do have a google.""The Sitter (original airdate: 9-21-85)When Jamie's babysitter flakes out, Ted programs Vicki to take up the slack. And as usual Vicki causes more harm than help.The Suitor (original airdate: 9-28-85)The show opens with Jamie telling Vicki, ""you're faster than a tongue in an ice-cream factory"" to uproarious laughter. Gosh, they just don't write stuff like that anymore. When Warren falls in love with Vicki it's up to the Lawsons to reprogram her. And what was up with Warren's blubbering?- w/ commentary with Dick Christie, Marla Pennington, Jerry Supiran & Daryl Bartley (Warren)Sibling Rivalry (original airdate: 10-5-85)Jamie hits the road when Vicki gets all of his parents' attention. After Ted and Joan figure out where he's hiding they decide to let him come home on his own accord.Spielberg Jr. (original airdate: 10-12-85)Jamie becomes a little too demanding when he makes a home movie, prompting his parents and Reggie to teach him a lesson in friendship.Disc Two:The Lie (original airdate: 10-19-85)When Harriet and her cousin surface Jamie learns that honesty is the best policy after he pulls the wool over his parents' eyes once too many times. Take special notice of Vicki's basketball moves.The Bully (original airdate: 10-26-85)A neighborhood bully scares Jamie and his friends into giving him money. So it's Vicki to the rescue once again.Slightly Dishonorable (original airdate: 11-2-85)Jamie uses Vicki to cheat on his homework. Incidentally, what was up with his teacher coming by his home to talk to his parents? Didn't they have telephones in the '80s?The Adoption (original airdate: 11-9-85)After busy-body Bonnie reports Joan and Ted to child protective services they're forced take action in perhaps the first time in world history that a robot was ever legally adopted. By the way, what was up with Joanie's pink pants suit? It looked like something out of Star Wars.Child Genius (original airdate: 11-16-85)Mrs. Fernwald takes it upon herself to get Vicki a private tutor when the Lawsons make up another outlandish fib. This time Joan is forced to get her teaching credential to keep the lie rolling along smoothly.Ted's New Boss (original airdate: 11-23-85)The Brindles take habitat in the Lawsons when they have a house fire. By the way, did anyone notice that stupid bird? The thing was obviously half dead, yet it managed to run its mouth more than Joan Rivers.- w/ commentary with Dick Christie, Marla Pennington, Jerry Supiran & Eddie McClurg (Bonnie Brindle)Disc Three:Brainwashed (original airdate: 11-30-85)This is one of my personal favorite eps. Unbeknownst to Ted, Vicki takes off to Harriet's and gets a lesson in how to be a spoiled little monster. I love it when Harriet says, ""that's all I need, braces on top of freckles, I'll never get married."" So funny.The Burrito Story (original airdate: 1-4-86)With the help of Reggie and Vicki, Jamie turns his mother's kitchen into a Del Taco.The Camping Trip (original airdate: 1-11-86)The gang all go camping and wind up getting lost.Love Story (original airdate: 1-18-86)Jamie falls in love with super-snob Jessica and throws her a special party. When the school tomboy shows up in a dress Jamie realizes that there's more than 1 fish in the sea.Substitute Father (original airdate: 1-25-86)Ted decides that golf is more important than spending time with his son, so Jamie uses ""surrogate-father"" Brindle as a proxy.The Robot Nappers (original airdate: 2-8-86)A misunderstanding develops when a couple of corporate spies think that Harriet is the android they're after. Suffice it to say, the Lawsons are more than happy to play along with this little game.- w/ commentary with Dick Christie, Marla Pennington, Jerry Supiran & Eddie McClurgDisc Four:The Company Takeover (original airdate: 2-15-86)The family all pulls together when they think that Ted's job is in jeopardy. Danny Wells (otherwise known as Charlie the bartender) has a part in this ep as Discount Dale.Good Ol' Lou (original airdate: 2-22-86)At Ted's insistence, the Lawsons all get on an exercise kick after one of Ted's associates goes on a diet with drastic (and dramatic) results.Like Father, Like Son (original airdate: 3-1-86)Jamie doesn't know how to tell his father that he doesn't make the football team.Vaudeville Vicki (original airdate: 5-3-86)With the help of Ken Berry, this ep has more bad acting, singing and dramatics than a Suzanne Somers special.The Real Facts of Life (original airdate: 5-10-86)This ep really dates this show because it's an entire program about s-e-x, yet nothing is ever discussed. Instead there are whispers and rumors because everyone is too bashful to tell it like it is. Sorry there's no Mrs. G on this ep!The Grandparents (original airdate: 5-17-86)Vicki sheds a few tears after her adopted grandfather calls her a few choice words (because he has a thing against robots). However she's welcomed back into the family after she saves Grandpa Lawson's life.- w/ commentary with Dick Christie, Marla Pennington & Jerry SupiranAdditional bonuses on disc 4: fan art gallery (my favorite is the one of Vicki's back with the DVD built in; so funny).I have great news, Season 2 of ""Small Wonder"" will be available in June 2010!!! It is going to be sold directly by Shout! Note to 20th Century Fox / Shout Factory - PLEASE PUT OUT THE REST OF THE SERIES, YOU HAVE MANY FANS (FROM AROUND THE WORLD!!!) WHO WILL BUY IT!!!!!No, the acting wasn't Emmy-worthy and the series was not ""critically acclaimed,"" and the stories were hokey and ludicrous. But ""Small Wonder"" is still a stand-out show that has withstood the test of time because so many are able to celebrate such a wholesome show that the entire family can relate to.""Small Wonder"" helps define a decade by becoming one of the best shows of its genre. ...That makes sense!",5,Small Wonder is: Classic '80s Comfort TV,1147478400,"05 13, 2006",2006,10425,"['huge', 'fan', 'Small',

Producer Sez 'Early 2010' for DVDs!DVD producer lets the cat out of the bag on the studio's official message boardsPosted by David LambertOne of the cult favorite syndicated TV shows of the '80s was the 1985 series Small Wonder, starring Tiffany Brissette (who later appeared in an episode of Parker Lewis Can't Lose and several epsiodes of Equal Justice). Brissette played ""Vicki"", a robot made up to look like a little girl, and who's proper name was actuall ""V.I.C.I."" (Voice Input Child Identicant). Other stars included Dick Christie (Days of Our Lives), Marla Pennington (Soap), Jerry Supiran (Galactica 1980) and Emily Schulman (Christy). Schulman twice won a Young Artist Award for her work on Small Wonder.The series, which ran for 4 seasons and 96 episodes, is among the top thirty most-wanted series that are unreleased on DVD, according to our site's registered members who vote for which shows they want to see on home video. Apparently the large following hasn't gone unnoticed, because our friends at Shout! Factory seem to have picked up the rights to this release. At least, that's what one of Shout!'s DVD Producers, Brian Ward, told fans yesterday at the studio's official message board! In a thread where fans were requesting that Shout! put out the program, Ward responded, ""Oh, all right... Because it's you guys, we'll release it. Expect the first volume sometime early next year. - Brian""Excellent news! Our thanks to all the readers who e-mailed us to make sure we saw that post, beginning with ""Christopher H.""; we appreciate the heads-up! We'll get everybody an exact release date and other details about this long-awaited release, just as soon as Shout! finalizes everything.

I know that's probably an extreme reaction to have upon hearing the news of a DVD release, but I have a soft spot in my heart for hokey sitcoms and Small Wonder has been stuck in my memory for years. I can't recall if I watched the show when it was still in first-run production, but I do remember watching it when it was re-aired on a local station when I was in the sixth grade. The absurd premise always stuck with me and I couldn't wait to see it again.After reading some of the reviews here and elsewhere, I can't help but wonder why people comment on how bad the show is and how cheap the special effects were. That's like stating that the sky is blue or water is wet. If someone isn't aware that a syndicated show (ie too lame to be picked up by one of the Big Three) geared towards kids under 12 that was produced and written in the 1980s isn't on par with Shakespeare, they either weren't alive during that (wonderful) era or have been living under a rock for the past 30 years. In other words, it goes without saying that the show was bad. Did you really expect a show about a child robot to move you? I know nostalgia has a funny way of coloring one's memory, but I can't imagine anyone, even a child, not noticing that the show's special effects were hilariously inept, the acting was terrible and the jokes were corny even for a kids' show. I wasn't the most observant 11-year old on the planet, but even I noticed those things when I first watched the show.That being said, 20+ years later I can apperciate the badness that Small Wonder has now just as I did when I was a kid. There are no storylines that are terribly memorable, no lines of dialogue that will make you bust a gut, and no technical wizardry that will leave you wondering ""How'd they do that?"". At the same time, the show is oddly entertaining. It's cute without being sickening and it even manages to occasionally teach a lesson without being preachy.As for the DVD's Special Features, they are limited. Included are some station promos and commentary from almost all of the main cast (save for Tiffany Brissette aka V.I.C.K.I, who I suspect didn't want to ride the nostalgia train) on select episodes. It's always a blast to hear casts reminiscing about filming a show and getting a little backstage dirt. It's obvious that the cast does have a sense of humor about themselves and that they too knew that the show was cheesy.Overall, this is not a bad buy. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone because it's obviously a niche show, but I thoroughly enjoy watching the episodes when I'm in a cheap 80s sitcom kinda mood.",5,"She's fantastic, made of plastic...",1353024000,"11 16, 2012",2012,2730,"[""'m"", 'child', '80s', '90s', 'so', 'when', 'heard', 'Shout', 'was', 'finally', 'releasing', 'elusive', 'Small', 'Wonder', 'DVD', 'was', 'pretty', 'jazzed', 'know', 'probably', 'extreme', 'reaction', 'have', 'hearing', 'news', 'DVD', 'release', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'heart', 'hokey', 'sitcoms', 'Small', 'Wonder', 'been', 'stuck', 'memory', 'years', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'watched', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'first-run', 'production', 'do', 'remember', 'watching', 'when', 'was', 're-aired', 'local', 'station', 'when', 'was', 'sixth', 'grade', 'absurd', 'premise', 'always', 'stuck', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'again.After', 'reading', 'reviews', 'here', 'elsewhere', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'people', 'comment', 'how', 'bad', 'show', 'how', 'cheap', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'stating', 'sky', 'blue', 'water', 'wet', 'someone', ""n't"", 'aware', 'syndicated', 'show', 'ie', 'too', 'lame', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'one', 'Big', 'Three', 'geared', 'towards', 'kids', '12', 'was', 'produced', 'written', '1980s', ""n't"", 'par', 'Shakespeare', 'were', ""n't"", 'alive', 'wonderful', 'era', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'rock', 'past', '30', 'years', 'other', 'words', 'saying', 'show', 'was', 'bad', 'Did', 'really', 'expect', 'show', 'child', 'robot', 'move', 'know', 'nostalgia', 'funny', 'way', 'coloring', 'one', 'memory', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'even', 'child', 'not', 'noticing', 'show', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'hilariously', 'inept', 'acting', 'was', 'terrible', 'jokes', 'were', 'corny', 'even', 'kids', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'most', 'observant', '11-year', 'old', 'planet', 'even', 'noticed', 'things', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'show.That', 'being', 'said', '20+', 'years', 'later', 'can', 'apperciate', 'badness', 'Small', 'Wonder', 'now', 'just', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'are', 'storylines', 'are', 'terribly', 'memorable', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'will', 'make', 'bust', 'gut', 'technical', 'wizardry', 'will', 'leave', 'wondering', 'How', ""'d"", 'do', 'same', 'time', 'show', 'oddly', 'entertaining', 'cute', 'being', 'sickening', 'even', 'occasionally', 'teach', 'lesson', 'being', 'preachy.As', 'DVD', 'Special', 'Features', 'are', 'limited', 'Included', 'are', 'station', 'promos', 'commentary', 'almost', 'main', 'cast', 'save', 'Tiffany', 'Brissette', 'aka', 'V.I.C.K.I', 'who', 'suspect', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'ride', 'nostalgia', 'train', 'select', 'episodes', 'always', 'blast', 'hear', 'casts', 'reminiscing', 'filming', 'show', 'getting', 'little', 'backstage', 'dirt', 'obvious', 'cast', 'have', 'sense', 'humor', 'too', 'knew', 'show', 'was', 'cheesy.Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'buy', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'everyone', 'obviously', 'niche', 'show', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'episodes', 'when', ""'m"", 'cheap', '80s', 'sitcom', 'kinda', 'mood']",Small Wonder: Season 1

642728,A256JOUD8X0J7R,B00005JOQZ,"musicfan ""The 80s are my favorite""","[0, 0]","I used to watch Small Wonder in the 80s when it was new.  I was little and the special effects and far-out story of a robot girl were okay by me.  I liked shows that had central characters who were children around the same age as me.  About a decade later, I watched it in reruns.  I still liked it, but it looked cornier than it had before.  About another decade later, and I get to watch it on dvd.  It looks even cornier, but, I still like it.  It brings me back to childhood in the 80s.The story revolves around The Lawson family-parents and son Jamie.  The dad brings home one of his inventions from work-VICI, a robot that looks like a little girl.  She quickly becomes a member of the family.  I like the show for being harmless fun, but also for nostalgia.  I love to see the details.  For instance, the Alvin doll that Jamie has in his room is the same one I had as a kid.  My favorite episodes are The Neighbors, Brainwashed, Spielberg Jr., The Sitter, and The Burrito Story.  There are funny moments such as Vicki and Jamie dancing to a fake Michael Jackson song.  Another main character is Harriet, the nosy neighbor with a crush on Jamie.  She is always snooping around and peeking in his window.  I used to hate Harriet, I thought she was an obnoxious mean kid, but she doesn't seem that way now.  She isn't really mean, just very pushy and snoopy.  She's actually pretty funny.  Especially when she shows Vicky how to throw a tantrum.  I think she got more annoying in later seasons.  Her parents are even worse.  Edie McClurg plays Harriet's mother and I remember her best as Mrs. Poole on The Hogan Family, and also from Ferris Bueller.  The show has budget special effects, but they really aren't so bad considering when the show was made.  They didn't look so awful then.  They're funny now.Shout Factory released Punky Brewster on dvd among others, and they always do a great job of package design as well as content.  The packaging and menus are always nicely printed and colorful, unlike some studios that release dvds that look like they were printed off someone's home computer.  As for bonuses, they've included episode commentary, a fan art gallery, and original episode promos which are fun to watch.  I remember when shows were promoted like that.  It's too bad that Tiffany Brissette and Emily Schulman did not participate in the commentary.  It would have been interesting to hear the girls' perspective.  No Reggie, either.  They did get the actor who played Warren to comment on one episode which is nice.TV is so different now, and not for the better.  This kind of show just isn't made anymore.  You don't see anything like Small Wonder, Punky, Full House, Perfect Strangers, The Facts of Life, etc. anymore.  Small Wonder is not of the same quality/caliber as those shows, but at least it is safe for families to watch.  How often do we see that on tv today?  The writing is not the greatest and the acting probably wouldn't win any awards, but the show has an 80s charm about it.  Mostly for people who liked it as children.  When I was a kid, I thought of Vicky more as a Short Circuit type of robot, one that kind of came alive after a while.  Watching now, I couldn't help but think that Vicky was more like a giant doll.  She changes a little in the last episode of the season.  I can't remember later seasons, but I think she became more ""human"" in those.  Anyway, season 2 has been released exclusively through SF's site, and I am thinking about buying one.  If only SF were in charge of Growing Pains dvds.  I'm sure they would have done a great job with those.",4,Funny Oddball Comedy,1281398400,"08 10, 2010",2010,3604,"['used', 'watch', 'Small', 'Wonder', '80s', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'was', 'little', 'special', 'effects', 'far-out', 'story', 'robot', 'girl', 'were', 'okay', 'liked', 'shows', 'had', 'central', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'children', 'same', 'age', 'decade', 'later', 'watched', 'reruns', 'still', 'liked', 'looked', 'cornier', 'had', 'decade', 'later', 'get', 'watch', 'dvd', 'even', 'cornier', 'still', 'back', 'childhood', '80s.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Lawson', 'family-parents', 'son', 'Jamie', 'dad', 'home', 'one', 'inventions', 'work-VICI', 'robot', 'little', 'girl', 'quickly', 'member', 'family', 'show', 'being', 'harmless', 'fun', 'also', 'nostalgia', 'love', 'see', 'details', 'instance', 'Alvin', 'doll', 'Jamie', 'room', 'same', 'one', 'had', 'kid', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'are', 'Neighbors', 'Brainwashed', 'Spielberg', 'Jr.', 'Sitter', 'Burrito', 'Story', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'such', 'Vicki', 'Jamie', 'dancing', 'fake', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'song', 'main', 'character', 'Harriet', 'nosy', 'neighbor', 'crush', 'Jamie', 'always', 'snooping', 'around', 'peeking', 'window', 'used', 'hate', 'Harriet', 'thought', 'was', 'obnoxious', 'mean', 'kid', ""n't"", 'seem', 'way', 'now', ""n't"", 'really', 'mean', 'just', 'very', 'pushy', 'snoopy', 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Especially', 'when', 'Vicky', 'how', 'throw', 'tantrum', 'think', 'got', 'more', 'annoying', 'later', 'seasons', 'parents', 'are', 'even', 'worse', 'Edie', 'McClurg', 'Harriet', 'mother', 'remember', 'best', 'Mrs.', 'Poole', 'Hogan', 'Family', 'also', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'show', 'budget', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'considering', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'made', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'so', 'awful', 'then', ""'re"", 'funny', 'Factory', 'released', 'Punky', 'Brewster', 'dvd', 'others', 'always', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'package', 'design', 'as', 'well', 'content', 'packaging', 'menus', 'are', 'always', 'nicely', 'printed', 'colorful', 'studios', 'release', 'look', 'were', 'printed', 'off', 'someone', 'home', 'computer', 'bonuses', ""'ve"", 'included', 'episode', 'commentary', 'fan', 'art', 'gallery', 'original', 'episode', 'promos', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'remember', 'when', 'shows', 'were', 'promoted', 'too', 'bad', 'Tiffany', 'Brissette', 'Emily', 'Schulman', 'did', 'not', 'participate', 'commentary', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'hear', 'girls', 'perspective', 'Reggie', 'either', 'did', 'get', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Warren', 'comment', 'one', 'episode', 'nice.TV', 'so', 'different', 'now', 'not', 'better', 'kind', 'show', 'just', ""n't"", 'made', 'anymore', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'Small', 'Wonder', 'Punky', 'Full', 'House', 'Perfect', 'Strangers', 'Facts', 'Life', 'etc', 'anymore', 'Small', 'Wonder', 'not', 'same', 'quality/caliber', 'shows', 'least', 'safe', 'families', 'watch', 'How', 'often', 'do', 'see', 'tv', 'today', 'writing', 'not', 'greatest', 'acting', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'show', '80s', 'charm', 'Mostly', 'people', 'who', 'liked', 'children', 'When', 'was', 'kid', 'thought', 'Vicky', 'more', 'Short', 'Circuit', 'type', 'robot', 'one', 'kind', 'came', 'alive', 'while', 'Watching', 'now', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'Vicky', 'was', 'more', 'giant', 'doll', 'little', 'last', 'episode', 'season', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'later', 'seasons', 'think', 'became', 'more', 'human', 'Anyway', 'season', '2', 'been', 'released', 'exclusively', 'SF', 'site', 'am', 'thinking', 'buying', 'one', 'only', 'SF', 'were', 'charge', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'dvds', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'great', 'job']",Small Wonder: Season 1

642734,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B00005JOQZ,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[11, 28]","This is hands down the worst 'low budget' series from my childhood. I can only remember it because in the hands of a production team which actually knew what they wanted to do, it then probally would have done really good. Yes, I am being serious.But in contrast, this was just really creepy. Computer engineer Ted Lawson (Dick Christie) is talented enough to create a child-robot (Tiffany Brisette) who looks like a little girl. But they keep 'VICI' dressed in the exact same pinafore--and have her sleep in brother Jamie's (Jerry Supiran) bedroom closet!For some reason, this 'daughter' never gets her own bedroom--or enough clothes to wear on a daily basis, which would leave a positive impression upon nosey neighbors.Joan (Marla Pennington) allegedly is the one who regards VICI as an actual child, but she noticieably still goes along with her husband's idea to use VICI as an appliance/servant--inevitably undercutting what could have been a pioneering 'adoption' storyline when computer techonology was still comparatively infantile.Turning her into an appliance obviously ruins the whole concept of a 'daughter'. You can't have your daughter working as an appliance and then try to regard her as just one of the family. Sorry.Plus those ever-nosey neighbors probally would want to know where VICI's room is in the house they're always having parties at!Even if they did never figure out she was a robot, they would have wondered what was going on.Surely the obviously moneyed Lawsons could have forked over extra money for VICI's own bedroom--or a larger wardrobe allowance for who was supposed to be 'series star'. Why does she wear the same clothes day in-and-day out without anybody ever questioning? What kind of paralell dimension does everybody live in?This series frequently gets compared to 'out of this world'. But that 80's independently franchised sitcom was produced with much better foresight and planning regarding production and scripting considerations. So it resulted in an overall watchable product.

The Voice Input Child Identicant (nicknamed VICI or Vickie), soon becomes a member for the family. Joan Lawson quickly comes to think of Vickie has her own daughter, and son Jamie continually tries to exploit Vickie by getting her to do his homework and chores.This original sitcom from the 80's stars Dick Christie as Ted Lawson, Tiffany Brissette as V.I.C.I., Marla Pennington as Joan Lawson, Jerry Supiran as Jamie Lawson, Emily Schulman as next-door-neighbor Harriet Brindle, and Edie McClurg as Harriet's busybody mother.As a child of the 80's and life-long scifi fan, Small Wonder held a special place in my heart. For their extremely limited budget, and time period, the special effects are not all that bad. The commentaries were especially enjoyable, hearing about what went on behind the scenes, Vickie's eternal pinafore, and how they were actually not allowed to downplay anything. Dick Christie was told to overdo the acting. Besides the usual corny jokes, catch-phrases (""THAT makes sense!"") and over-acting, the stories and heart of the show actually made me fall in love with the show all over again.Specs:- The 4-disc DVD set includes all 24 episodes from season 1- Multiple commentaries with creator and cast- Original episode promos- Fan art gallery",4,Old School SciFi Sitcom,1266451200,"02 18, 2010",2010,1388,"['When', 'Ted', 'Lawson', 'inspired', 'create', 'life-like', 'robot', 'see', 'experiment', 'can', 'pass', 'real', 'girl', 'Voice', 'Input', 'Child', 'Identicant', 'nicknamed', 'VICI', 'Vickie', 'soon', 'member', 'family', 'Joan', 'Lawson', 'quickly', 'think', 'Vickie', 'own', 'daughter', 'son', 'Jamie', 'continually', 'exploit', 'Vickie', 'getting', 'do', 'homework', 'chores.This', 'original', 'sitcom', '80', 'stars', 'Dick', 'Christie', 'Ted', 'Lawson', 'Tiffany', 'Brissette', 'V.I.C.I.', 'Marla', 'Pennington', 'Joan', 'Lawson', 'Jerry', 'Supiran', 'Jamie', 'Lawson', 'Emily', 'Schulman', 'next-door-neighbor', 'Harriet', 'Brindle', 'Edie', 'McClurg', 'Harriet', 'busybody', 'child', '80', 'life-long', 'scifi', 'fan', 'Small', 'Wonder', 'held', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'extremely', 'limited', 'budget', 'time', 'period', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'commentaries', 'were', 'especially', 'enjoyable', 'hearing', 'what', 'went', 'scenes', 'Vickie', 'eternal', 'pinafore', 'how', 'were', 'actually', 'not', 'allowed', 'downplay', 'anything', 'Dick', 'Christie', 'was', 'told', 'overdo', 'acting', 'usual', 'corny', 'jokes', 'catch-phrases', 'sense', 'over-acting', 'stories', 'heart', 'show', 'actually', 'made', 'fall', 'love', 'show', 'again.Specs', '4-disc', 'DVD', 'set', '24', 'episodes', 'season', '1-', 'Multiple', 'commentaries', 'creator', 'cast-', 'Original', 'episode', 'promos-', 'Fan', 'art', 'gallery']",Small Wonder: Season 1

A vastly underrated show that lived up to its title, Small Wonder baffled critics and delighted devoted fans with its humorous yet quaint presentation for a fairly lengthy series run. Well preserved here on DVD by Shout! Factory (props to DVD producer Kristen Kennedy), this 4-disc (single-sided) set contains all 24 original Season One episodes in their intended (first-run) order, plus the following Special Features:  Commentaries with Cast and Crew, Original Episode Promos, and Fan Art Gallery. Housed in slimcases all inside a slim outer box, the discs play flawlessly and feature episode select, play all, and bonus features menu options. The set's special features are neat and much appreciated, especially the commentaries by cast & crew which surprisingly include recurring guest star Daryl Bartley who was first introduced as Jamie's friend and school nerd Warren Enright in ""The Suitor"". Like the rest of the cast, Bartley offers some interesting commentary. Sadly, stars Tiffany Brissette (Vicki the Robot) and Emily Schulman (nosy neighbor Harriet Brindle) did not take part in any of the commentaries. However, Edie McClurg (who regularly guest starred as Harriet's mother Bonnie Brindle) somewhat compensates for their absences with her comments on where they are today. Hopefully, Shout!
