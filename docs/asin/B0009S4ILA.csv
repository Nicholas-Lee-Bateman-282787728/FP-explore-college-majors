912114,AK0CENM3LUM28,B0009S4ILA,Amazon Customer,"[5, 7]","5 Children and It / B0009S4ILA*Spoilers*If you haven't read Nesbit's book, 5 Children and It, then likely this review will mean little to you and you will find better information in some of the other reviews. If you are like me, however, and remember Nesbit's charming tale from childhood, you may be considering this movie based on your love of the book.Do not be fooled. This book jettisons everything lovely about Nesbit's tale in favor of a blatant Narnia rip-off that is painfully obvious. Like Narnia (the movie, not the book), the movie starts with the children being shuffled off to the countryside in a train, longing for their parents and their familiar surroundings. The countryside house looks like a replica of the Narnia film house, and the sandpit with no sea (which the children find so pointless and boring) is not here. We'll get to that later.The house caretakers are, a la Narnia, quirky and old and eccentric. A good deal of film is wasted on this portion of the movie, detailing how boring it is at the house, how much time is to be spent on maths, how long the chores lists for the children is. There's a abhorrent cousin added here for unnecessary conflict.One day, on a rainy day, the children are bored and cooped up in the house and they find a magical doorway to another world. You'll note that 0% of that is in Nesbit's book, but 100% of that statement describes Narnia. Fine. The other world has a luxurious beach, complete with a large ocean, and the children take this in stride - no disbelief, no wonder, no worries.When they unearth ""It"", the voice......stings. ""It"" sounds like...Eddie Izzard. There's no other way to put it. (Eddie Izzard is also a voice in the Narnia series. Do we see a pattern here?) It wisecracks, It sounds like a wise guy. When the children feign disinterest in It, he practically begs to be paid attention to. And the whole twist of the book, the drama of ""Is It ruining the wishes on purpose?"", is immediately tossed to the winds (and incorrectly) by making it very clear with supernatural spying and smirking that, yes, It is ruining the wishes deliberately and on purpose.When I tried to enjoy this movie apart from the radical changes in the storyline, I found I could not - the dialogue is boring, the action predictable, and the story ""twists"" are painfully bad. I don't doubt that a small child may like this, but if you're looking into this for literary nostalgia, as I was - Stay Away!This version provides a closed caption option for the hard of hearing.~ Ana Mardoll",1,"Why follow Nesbit's book, when Narnia made so much money?",1232064000,"01 16, 2009",2009,2537,"['5', 'Children', 'B0009S4ILA*Spoilers*If', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Nesbit', 'book', '5', 'Children', 'then', 'likely', 'review', 'will', 'mean', 'little', 'will', 'find', 'better', 'information', 'other', 'reviews', 'are', 'however', 'remember', 'Nesbit', 'charming', 'tale', 'childhood', 'may', 'be', 'considering', 'movie', 'based', 'love', 'book.Do', 'not', 'be', 'fooled', 'book', 'jettisons', 'everything', 'lovely', 'Nesbit', 'tale', 'favor', 'blatant', 'Narnia', 'rip-off', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'Narnia', 'movie', 'not', 'book', 'movie', 'children', 'being', 'shuffled', 'off', 'countryside', 'train', 'longing', 'parents', 'familiar', 'surroundings', 'countryside', 'house', 'replica', 'Narnia', 'film', 'house', 'sandpit', 'sea', 'children', 'find', 'so', 'pointless', 'boring', 'not', 'here', ""'ll"", 'get', 'later.The', 'house', 'caretakers', 'are', 'la', 'Narnia', 'quirky', 'old', 'eccentric', 'good', 'deal', 'film', 'wasted', 'portion', 'movie', 'detailing', 'how', 'boring', 'house', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'be', 'spent', 'maths', 'how', 'long', 'chores', 'children', 'abhorrent', 'cousin', 'added', 'here', 'unnecessary', 'conflict.One', 'day', 'rainy', 'day', 'children', 'are', 'bored', 'cooped', 'up', 'house', 'find', 'magical', 'doorway', 'world', ""'ll"", 'note', '0', '%', 'Nesbit', 'book', '100', '%', 'statement', 'Narnia', 'Fine', 'other', 'world', 'luxurious', 'beach', 'complete', 'large', 'ocean', 'children', 'take', 'stride', 'disbelief', 'wonder', 'worries.When', 'unearth', 'voice', 'stings', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'other', 'way', 'put', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'also', 'voice', 'Narnia', 'series', 'Do', 'see', 'pattern', 'here', 'wise', 'guy', 'When', 'children', 'feign', 'disinterest', 'practically', 'be', 'paid', 'attention', 'whole', 'twist', 'book', 'drama', 'ruining', 'wishes', 'purpose', 'immediately', 'tossed', 'winds', 'incorrectly', 'making', 'very', 'clear', 'supernatural', 'spying', 'smirking', 'yes', 'ruining', 'wishes', 'deliberately', 'purpose.When', 'tried', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'apart', 'radical', 'changes', 'storyline', 'found', 'could', 'not', 'dialogue', 'boring', 'action', 'predictable', 'story', 'twists', 'are', 'painfully', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'small', 'child', 'may', 'like', ""'re"", 'looking', 'literary', 'nostalgia', 'was', 'Stay', 'Away', 'version', 'closed', 'caption', 'option', 'hard', 'hearing.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",5 Children & It

The special effects were good for its time, but for some reason it has a very 80's feel to it although it is a fantasy film.2. The Witches (1990) - I believe that this was Jim Henson's last film before his untimely death. A boy overhears a group of witches scheming, and when he is discovered they turn him into a mouse. He then has to save the day while still in the form of a mouse.3. The Secret Garden (1993) - A young girl's parents are killed in an earthquake and she is sent to live with her uncle who is still mourning the death of his wife after ten years. There she finds an overrun garden that was her aunt's, a sickly cousin that has been told to stay indoors at all times, and a servant boy who becomes her close friend.

Eddie Izzard's voice star in this remake of ""Five Children and It"", orignally based on E. Nesbit's novel of the same name. I haven't read the book (though I'd like to), but I grew up with the old TV serial, which I thought was great. Though it's great to see the story with a bigger budget and some fine actors, and its fine family entertainment, I wish it was more like that old serial.In the midst of World War I, a father goes to war and five children are sent into the country until things cool down a bit in England's south. The kids are sent to their Uncle Albert's (Kenneth Branagh), an eccentric writer of maths textbooks who likes his rules and dislikes distrubances. One of the rules of the house is that they are not allowed into the greenhouse. Robert (Freddie Highmore) who is a bit of a rulebreaker, goes in anyway and discovers a beach beyond an old doorway. On that beach, he finds a sand fairy, the Psammead (voiced by Eddie Izzard). Sand fairies can grant wishes, which is a pretty good thing to have access to, even if the wishes often go wrong and only last until the sun sets. Still, the kids get up to all sorts of adventures thanks to the Psammead's power.The film is very well cast for the most part. The boys are as they should be, the girls are loving and sweet, and Kenneth Branagh makes a brilliant Uncle Albert. I can't say I really like the idea of Eddie Izzard as the Psammead. It's the voice he chooses that bugs me. It's kind of British, kind of French, which kind of makes him a bit zanier and cartoonish than the sagely plump puppet from the TV serial. Doesn't make him seem as wise and ancient, which is something I used to love about his character. It might be just the script, but this film's sand-fairy is a bit more wise cracking too, which usually annoys me, but its pretty restrained here, so it isn't too bad. Like I said, I haven't read the book, but I'm sure the TV series wasn't as ""Narnia"" as this. A beach in a greenhouse cupboard? Was it really like that? I don't know...Special features include an hour long making of documentary, featuring interviews from all the actors (Freddie Highmore, Kenneth Branagh, etc), and a couple of interviews from the crew on the more technical side of things. The kids seemed really nice from their interviews. There's also an outtakes montage, some unused audio improvs from Eddie Izzard's It, a featurette on merchandise from the film (pretty much a commercial), a storyboard gallery, a design gallery, a photo gallery and a series of trailers from both TV and the theatres.A reasonable kids film, but I do prefer the old TV serial.

This dreadful little movie has practically nothing in common with the classic book of the same title by E. Nesbit. If you're a fan of children's literature and enjoy the wonderful tone and content of Five Children and It (the book) then find the other movie version of it, titled ""The Sand Fairy."" I believe it was done by the BBC. There is also a second, called  ""Return of the Sand Fairy.""Like everyone else, I loved Freddie Highmore in Finding Neverland (and as Charlie) and he's just as charming here, as Robert, the second oldest boy and the starring role in this version (Freddie gets top billing and Robert's part is much more central than in the book). It's not Freddie's fault that this script is a bad jumble of kid-movie cliches brought together by someone who obviously never read E. Nesbit's classic, or if they did, cared nothing for it. Nesbit is a wonderful children's writer, full of wit and magic. C.S. Lewis himself said he was inspired by Nesbit's work when he created his Narnia books. However, in this production, it's Lewis' classics that seem to lend most of the plot. The kids here are evacuated during the war (WWI in this case) and live with a ""mad uncle"" and his very odd son in a castle by the sea. It's as if they took several Lewis books, tried to add a Harry Potter feel, and then CGI'd a character (the sand fairy) for that modern flashiness. A few of the wishes from the actual story occur (wings, spending money) but the entire tone is one of ""wacky adventure"" as the kids run rampant and the sand fairy cracks jokes. Freddie has his touching moments, missing their father, which is supposed to lend a depth that this movie could never quite hold.I have a high tolerance for children's entertainment, happily watching many a kiddy film, however I was bored from the first fifteen minutes. I did watch to the end, bound and determined to get it over with. As I did, I wondered what sort of person might be entertained by all this. My guess: one who has not been previously exposed to any of the great works that were badly ripped off here. One who is easily amused and has no need for consistency of tone or quality of script. One who has never heard of the E. Nesbit book and never intends to read it.

912124,A3SJ5A6L2FRGGW,B0009S4ILA,Keith_Joseph,"[3, 4]","This is a fairly faithful (in concept) retelling of E Nesbit's moralistic children's classic, although the story is reset in the first world war period. This film is very gentle and occasionally moving to watch, although it is more amusing than laugh out loud funny (at least when Eddie Izzard isn't about). It's more 'The railway children' or 'The secret garden' than 'Spy Kids' (hardly surprising as Nesbit also wrote The Railway Children).The stalwart British adult actor's Zoe Wannamaker and Kenneth Branagh are in good form and all the children are excellent and likable leads, particularly the young Freddie Highmore - now the new Charlie (in Charlie & the Chocolate factory) and his 'nasty cousin' Horace (Alexander Pownall). The wise & witty old sand fairy naturally steals all his scenes (and Eddy Izzard is really great as his voice). The only downside is the rather naff static dinosaur sequence, more than made up for though by the breathtaking Zeppelin scene (best viewed on the big screen). There are some other famous UK faces as well, including Norman Wisdom in a micro cameo. The film hasn't got the depth or historical accuracy of the three hour BBC's TV adaptation of the book from 1991, and is far less faithful to the book's plotline set in the earlier late Victorian/Edwardian period. However the film is quite acceptable fun and has the advantage that it can easily be viewed as a sequel to the superb BBC adaptation (if you can find it). The actual sequel to the book though is BBCs later 'all star' serialisation 'The Phoenix and the carpet', at present only available highly edited as a region 1 'Disney film' from Amazon (and this DVD is also highly recommended - until a proper BBC DVD set appears).On release, my 10 y old daughter and I chose this 'Five Children and it' film over Sharks Tale and didn't regret it. My daughter was absorbed throughout it (and cried a bit). My 8 y old son and mum really enjoyed this DVD later.

There are similar issues (the older brother ""in charge"" and the younger brother not happy about it), but the stories aren't copies of one another and didn't intend to be! They are both just movies of really good children's books.We are big fans of E. Nesbitt, and were a bit dubious about seeing this movie. As to staying true to the original novel, there are liberalities. However, there are a number of scenes which are similar and some which are just for the movie.  The wise-cracking psammead (sand fairy) makes some amusing comments, but thankfully, none of his jokes (or anyone else's) descend into that crude humor which is so prevalent in children's movies today.Yes, the acting is a bit weak; the kids seem to always have smiles on their faces for some reason.
