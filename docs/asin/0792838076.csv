As for genre, I'd put this as a cross between Boyz In The Hood/Casino. It's not a rip-off or anything, but the dialogue and characters seem to be cut from the same cloth. This movie is grossly underrated, and deserves to be up there with the likes of Donnie Brasco (another underrated film), and the Untouchables.

139917,A1WUGLK5OIZVIZ,0792838076,"""filmbuff2000""","[3, 12]","I was greatly disappointed by this unfocused gangster epic. It had a lot  of talent involved; Laurence Fishburne, Tim Roth, Andy Garcia and Vanessa  Angel. But the film was simply badly staged and had awful direction. Even  the talented cast was underappreciated. Laurence Fishburne, who is a very  talented actor as he has shown is in films like `Boyz N' The Hood' and  `What's Love Got To Do With It?' and had just recently scored big in as  Morpheus in `The Matrix'. But in all those films he was in the hands of  good directors and the material was good. In this film he plainly delivers  a bad performance that seems all the worse with all that awful dialogue  they make him say. Tim Roth is also a very talented actor but boldly  ventures into shameless overacting in this film, a very uneven performance  but he has a screen presence that is hard to ignore and is really good in  some scenes but awful in others. Vanessa Angel is the only person who seems  to know that the screenplay is ludicrous and delivers a so-so performance.  On the other hand, Andy Garcia delivers a good performance as Lucky  Luciano, a bit derivative of his character in `The Godfather Part III' but  still he delivers the best performance in the cast and makes the film  tolerable. The scenes involving Andy Garcia are the only good ones and the  rest of the film is laughable. `Hoodlum' is ambitious but falls short of  its ambitions. Basically a Godfather wannabe but set in Harlem, it portrays  the rise of `Bumpy' Johnson. Probably the film's biggest flaws are the  direction and screenplay, they seem to fake, the dialogue is plain dumb and  the direction is awful. Probably the reason I took it like this is because  I expected a lot from the film, I saw all the talent involved and expected  a good film but instead got mediocre excuse for a gangster film with a  dragging pace. If you don't expect much from the film you may find it a  tolerable film but I found myself gravely disappointed. From a scale of  1-10 I give this film a 4!",2,Below Average Gangster Picture!,968284800,"09 7, 2000",2000,2028,"['was', 'greatly', 'disappointed', 'unfocused', 'gangster', 'epic', 'had', 'lot', 'talent', 'involved', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'Vanessa', 'Angel', 'film', 'was', 'simply', 'badly', 'staged', 'had', 'awful', 'direction', 'Even', 'talented', 'cast', 'was', 'underappreciated', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'who', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'shown', 'films', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Hood', 'What', 'Love', 'Got', 'Do', 'had', 'just', 'recently', 'scored', 'big', 'Morpheus', 'Matrix', 'films', 'was', 'hands', 'good', 'directors', 'material', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'plainly', 'bad', 'performance', 'worse', 'awful', 'dialogue', 'make', 'say', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'also', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'boldly', 'ventures', 'shameless', 'overacting', 'film', 'very', 'uneven', 'performance', 'screen', 'presence', 'hard', 'ignore', 'really', 'good', 'scenes', 'awful', 'others', 'Vanessa', 'Angel', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'know', 'screenplay', 'ludicrous', 'so-so', 'performance', 'other', 'hand', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'good', 'performance', 'Lucky', 'Luciano', 'bit', 'derivative', 'character', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'III', 'still', 'best', 'performance', 'cast', 'film', 'tolerable', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'are', 'only', 'good', 'ones', 'rest', 'film', 'laughable', 'Hoodlum', 'ambitious', 'short', 'ambitions', 'Basically', 'Godfather', 'wannabe', 'set', 'Harlem', 'rise', 'Bumpy', 'Johnson', 'Probably', 'film', 'biggest', 'flaws', 'are', 'direction', 'screenplay', 'seem', 'fake', 'dialogue', 'plain', 'dumb', 'direction', 'awful', 'Probably', 'reason', 'took', 'expected', 'lot', 'film', 'saw', 'talent', 'involved', 'expected', 'good', 'film', 'instead', 'got', 'mediocre', 'excuse', 'gangster', 'film', 'dragging', 'pace', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'film', 'may', 'find', 'tolerable', 'film', 'found', 'gravely', 'disappointed', 'scale', '1-10', 'give', 'film', '4']",N/A

Starring Lawrence Fishburne, Tim Roth, Vanessa Williams, Queen Latifah, Cicely Tyson, Clarence Williams lll and Andy Garcia.Supposedly the story of 20s/30s Harlem Gangster Bumpy Johnson but actually a 70s Blaxploitation retread. All the generally slimy Black racism is present as is the silly political boilerplate meant to excuse bad behavior by Blacks aka it is all whiteys fault.The direction, script, dialogue and acting is appallingly wretched on every possible level. The film staggers along with empty dialogue scenes alternating between the radical Black propaganda and fake attempts at objectively(the stupid female Black characters question the actions of the Black males and the dumb hos are put in their place.) Someone apparently thought that having Tim Roth use the F word in quite literally every line of dialogue would be innovative and subversive but only results in Roth never actually saying anything. On the other hand, Black gangsters, of course, are always polite and never swear. Only  Jews apparently use obscene language.(Roth plays Dutch Schultz who was Jewish).Another part of the problem..a major problem..is that Bumpy Johnson is a Black Paul Bunyon who supposedly protected Harlem from White gangsters when in reality he was the mob's representative in Harlem---their house slave if one likes. Yet this film has him in a major gang war against Dutch Schulz that involves Lucky Luciano and Thomas Dewey.Except NOTHING in the film.....NOTHING...happened. Dutch Schulz OWNED Harlem. No one ever opposed him there. After Schultz, the Mob took over with little difficulty using Johnson as their representative. There was none of the gang warfare portrayed in the film. Johnson never slit the throat of a white police captain. Thomas Dewey, who was a courageous DA who did incredible damage to the Mob in the 30s including putting Waxey Gordon and Luciano in prison, is portrayed as being corrupt and on Lucianos payrole. (Dewey was a Republican so this is a typical Liberal reverse the truth smear but it does not lessen its repugnance).In short except that there were people named Johnson, Schultz. Luciano and Dewey who lived in Manhattan in the 30s, the film is a complete and utter fraud.

For those of you who don't, Johnson was a member of an organized crime group, in Harlem, during the 1930's. He was also the man who mentored and inspired Denzel Washington's character of Frank Lucas in American Gangster. Long before that film, the story of Bumpy Johnson was told in Hoodlum. This was one of those little told stories about the mafia that started out very strong. Unfortunately, I felt that the writers went into far too much detail at certain points in the film and by the end it was definitely dragging on. Laurence Fishburne stars as Johnson and did an adequate job, my problem with his has always been he lacks emotion in his acting. In my humble opinion this should automatically disqualify him from certain things and this probably should have been one of those things. Tim Roth is Dutch Schultz and while Schultz had a reputation for being a character, Roth went a little over the top with it, but was still very entertaining. My favorite performance was of course the one by Andy Garcia as Lucky Luciano, but he really wasn't in the film much and that's a shame, because nobody plays a crime boss better than hen does. Hoodlum is a wild ride about an incredible true story, but as a film, it was a mix of terrific scenes and some slower unnecessary elements.
