1073318,A3VUXYHJGL9WWX,B000Q66H0A,"bass boy ""music fan""","[23, 24]","OK. It's not Deep Purple live 1972, but the band still rocks here. This DVD was filmed and recorded very well. Sound is full and fat, with nice balance between instruments. The camera crew and, later, DVD editors, knew what they were doing. When Glover has a bass solo or even a snazzy bass run, it's caught by the cameras. Same for Morse on guitar, Paice on drums, and Airey on keys/Hammond. Lots of nice closeups of the hands of Morse and Glover (musicians will rejoice!). A camera catches Paice drop a stick over the high-hat early in the set, and Paice, always the pro, quickly grabs another stick from below without missing a beat. Airey sounds good on keys. Long-time DP fans will probalby wish it was Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore in the band still, but the current DP still is a great band. Ian Gillan, who looks mysteriously more and more like actor Patrick Duffy these days, is in pretty good voice. He also has fun, moving from one side of the stage to the other, and all around. The guys look like they're having a really good time. Glover makes a few ""rock guitar faces"" without ever slipping into cheesy territory. Makes me want to go see them this summer in St.Louis, even though I'm broke. Ha.The older classics are always favorites, but ""Wrong Man"" on this DVD rocks. It's a great version and makes me appreciate Deep Purple's recent work, too. Same for ""Rapture of the Deep""'s title cut, also heard and seen in this film.

1073319,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000Q66H0A,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","I'm really surprised at just how magnificent of a performance this show turned out to be.I admit, I went in expecting a bunch of musicians who should have retired years ago still dragging on and attempting to rock the house down but ending up sounding (and looking) like a sad image of what they used to be.  I was 100% completely WRONG!This performance absolutely rocks with just as much aggression and energy as, dare I say, the legendary Made In Japan live classic released back in the early 70's.The biggest problem is that Ian Gillan can no longer hit the high notes without his voice falling apart.  This was actually a problem 25 years ago around the time Black Sabbath's Born Again was released, but his voice has unfortunately gotten even worse.  He just can't hit those high notes anymore, as evident by the way he was sweating and struggling to do so by pausing for a moment to build up the strength and attempt it.  However, he has apparently developed an ability to hide this fact because he can still sing the more restrained verse melodies really well.  He just can't scream like he used to back in the 70's.Besides really botching ""Space Truckin"", Ian Gillan didn't become too much of a distraction with his vocal mistakes.  Oh, and on an unrelated note, he sure does resemble William Shatner in the face!I also admired the way Ian Gillan would communicate with the audience.  He was very friendly, likeable and made jokes constantly.  Of course, that one moment when he made what I consider a racist joke was very very odd and out of place to say the least.  I know he meant it in a light-hearted way, but it was still a bit shocking to witness.I really like the way Ian Gillan would introduce the rest of the band.  He didn't do so all at once- he'd introduce one band member at a time, they'd perform an amazing solo for a few minutes, and then 20 minutes later Ian would introduce another band member and repeat the process all over again.  It was amazing and allowed both the audience at the concert and those of us at home to appreciate these dazzling solo performances by the band members on their respective musical instrument when the time came to do so.Steve Morse has officially won me over with his melodic guitar playing skills.  He played the guitar very very well throughout the performance and I absolutely loved the majority of the notes he was hitting.  A natural talent for being memorable, that just about describes his guitar playing abilities.  He's no Ritchie Blackmore of course, and I admit I *was* hoping for a surprise appearance by Ritchie even though I secretly knew it wouldn't happen, but well... there you have it.I did feel that ""Smoke on the Water"" was considerably softer than the studio version we've all been hearing for years now, but you know, most of the guitar solos and Ian Gillan's stage antics were always exciting and memorable enough that any complaints about the songs themselves weren't ever really worth taking into consideration.  Definitely not worth comparing to other versions either.Starting the show with ""Pictures of Home"" was a brilliant idea too.  I loved it.Overall, I'm surprised Ian Gillan still has the energy to make a concert like this happen, and the same applies to the rest of the band.  This performance really proves that, no matter the age, with enough determination, a return to the glory days is entirely in the realm of possibility.  I was certainly proven wrong about old guys reaching a certain age where they're no longer able to rock, because this concert lives up to the hype.  A great show.",5,I'm shocked!,1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,3585,"[""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'just', 'how', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'show', 'turned', 'out', 'be.I', 'admit', 'went', 'expecting', 'bunch', 'musicians', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'retired', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'dragging', 'attempting', 'rock', 'house', 'down', 'ending', 'up', 'sounding', 'looking', 'sad', 'image', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'was', '100', '%', 'completely', 'WRONG', 'performance', 'absolutely', 'just', 'much', 'aggression', 'energy', 'dare', 'say', 'legendary', 'Made', 'Japan', 'live', 'classic', 'released', 'back', 'early', ""70's.The"", 'biggest', 'problem', 'Ian', 'Gillan', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'hit', 'high', 'notes', 'voice', 'falling', 'apart', 'was', 'actually', 'problem', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'time', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'Born', 'Again', 'was', 'released', 'voice', 'unfortunately', 'gotten', 'even', 'worse', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hit', 'high', 'notes', 'anymore', 'evident', 'way', 'was', 'sweating', 'struggling', 'do', 'so', 'pausing', 'moment', 'build', 'up', 'strength', 'attempt', 'However', 'apparently', 'developed', 'ability', 'hide', 'fact', 'can', 'still', 'sing', 'more', 'restrained', 'verse', 'melodies', 'really', 'well', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'scream', 'used', 'back', ""70's.Besides"", 'really', 'botching', 'Space', 'Truckin', 'Ian', 'Gillan', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'too', 'much', 'distraction', 'vocal', 'mistakes', 'Oh', 'unrelated', 'note', 'sure', 'resemble', 'William', 'Shatner', 'face', 'also', 'admired', 'way', 'Ian', 'Gillan', 'would', 'communicate', 'audience', 'was', 'very', 'friendly', 'likeable', 'made', 'jokes', 'constantly', 'course', 'one', 'moment', 'when', 'made', 'what', 'consider', 'racist', 'joke', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'odd', 'place', 'say', 'least', 'know', 'meant', 'light-hearted', 'way', 'was', 'still', 'bit', 'shocking', 'witness.I', 'really', 'way', 'Ian', 'Gillan', 'would', 'introduce', 'rest', 'band', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'all', 'once-', ""'d"", 'introduce', 'one', 'band', 'member', 'time', ""'d"", 'perform', 'amazing', 'solo', 'few', 'minutes', 'then', '20', 'minutes', 'later', 'Ian', 'would', 'introduce', 'band', 'member', 'repeat', 'process', 'over', 'again', 'was', 'amazing', 'allowed', 'audience', 'concert', 'home', 'appreciate', 'dazzling', 'solo', 'performances', 'band', 'members', 'respective', 'musical', 'instrument', 'when', 'time', 'came', 'do', 'so.Steve', 'Morse', 'officially', 'won', 'melodic', 'guitar', 'playing', 'skills', 'played', 'guitar', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'performance', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'majority', 'notes', 'was', 'hitting', 'natural', 'talent', 'being', 'memorable', 'just', 'describes', 'guitar', 'playing', 'abilities', 'Ritchie', 'Blackmore', 'course', 'admit', '*was*', 'hoping', 'surprise', 'appearance', 'Ritchie', 'even', 'secretly', 'knew', 'would', ""n't"", 'happen', 'well', 'there', 'have', 'it.I', 'did', 'feel', 'Smoke', 'Water', 'was', 'considerably', 'softer', 'studio', 'version', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hearing', 'years', 'now', 'know', 'most', 'guitar', 'solos', 'Ian', 'Gillan', 'stage', 'antics', 'were', 'always', 'exciting', 'memorable', 'enough', 'complaints', 'songs', 'were', ""n't"", 'ever', 'really', 'worth', 'taking', 'consideration', 'Definitely', 'not', 'worth', 'comparing', 'other', 'versions', 'either.Starting', 'show', 'Pictures', 'Home', 'was', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'too', 'loved', 'it.Overall', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'Ian', 'Gillan', 'still', 'energy', 'make', 'concert', 'happen', 'same', 'applies', 'rest', 'band', 'performance', 'really', 'matter', 'age', 'enough', 'determination', 'return', 'glory', 'days', 'entirely', 'realm', 'possibility', 'was', 'certainly', 'proven', 'wrong', 'old', 'guys', 'reaching', 'certain', 'age', 'where', ""'re"", 'longer', 'able', 'rock', 'concert', 'up', 'hype', 'great', 'show']",N/A

Every live performance is a little different and has a charm of it's own. I love em all.Now I must say, I held back on buying this one. Well I held off on Perihelion too, but I just had to get Jon Lord's last performance on DVD. Now, he is gone? Another loss like Blackmore? OK, I bit and ordered ""They All Came Down to Montreux"". Don Airey is one hell of a keyboard player, maybe not up to Lord's standard, but who is? Ian Gillan is getting a little long-on-the-tooth, but the old fart can still carry a tune pretty dang good. Hey, these guy's are about my age, so I grew up with DP - got ""Hush"" on a 45. Speaking of ""Hush"". They did the BEST ""Hush"" version on this DVD I've heard.It's taking them a little longer to warm up these days, but by the time they get to ""When A Blind Man Cries"" the groove sets in. The two guest stars they brought in towards the end of the set were awesome.The bonus DVD, well another hour of DP live. I can't argue with that. So, what your getting is about (3) hours of DP in concert in total. Sweet.The quality is outstanding. I didn't get the HD-DVD version, but the standard DVD is pretty close to HD standards. really!If you like DP, they got a bunch of great DVD's for sale. They are getting on with age so if that's a problem for you, buy some of their earlier stuff first. Then when you still want that DP fix, get this one too.

1073324,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000Q66H0A,Robert I. Hedges,"[1, 1]","I am a fan of most of the various incarnations of Deep Purple, and while I didn't rush to buy this DVD, I'm glad I finally picked it up. ""Deep Purple Live at Montreux 2006"" comes in a two DVD format with one complete concert, one abridged club set, and lots of interviews that are fascinating. I must admit that while it's wonderful to see them at the Montreux Jazz Festival, this is not among the very best concerts from an audio perspective I have ever heard. At some points the sound mix is strange and instruments that are normally front and center in certain passages are buried far back in the mix: this is most noticeable with Don Airey's keyboard parts in a few places, while the worst case is Morse's guitar being totally buried under Roger Glover's bass on ""Black Night."" It is also true that Ian Gillan's voice is not what it used to be, as he struggles to reach some high notes and his timing is off a in a couple of instances (perhaps most notably during ""Smoke on the Water"".) I don't really think of that as a huge deficit as the alternative of him not singing and the band not touring would be a much worse option. Oddly, I saw them live last year and I thought his voice sounded much better then than on this DVD, so perhaps he just didn't have a great night when this was recorded (or maybe I just like them with the orchestra better.)The show is a standard set list from the era, with notable variations for the festival: I particularly enjoyed the jazz introduction to ""Smoke on the Water"" and Gillan's introduction (""it was written just down the road...."") Standouts were the very extended Morse demo ""The Well-Dressed Guitar"" which is off the charts here, and the rousing version of ""Hush,"" which is always a crowd pleaser. The Montreux performance features some special guests including famed founder of the Montreux Jazz Festival Claude Nobs, who was, of course, immortalized for his heroics as ""Funky Claude"" in ""Smoke on the Water."" You will enjoy his harmonica and duet with Gillian on ""Too Much Fun"" (during which they both have to read the lyrics off a sheet of paper.)The bottom line is that the Montreux gig was a beautifully shot though occasionally flawed performance. The rhythm powerhouse combo of Paice and Glover were spot on, and Steve Morse was simply outstanding. Airey was very good as well, and Gillan was an old pro who worked the audience with humor, and made them appreciate him in spite of the difficulty of living up to the legend of his own voice from forty years ago.The second DVD has an abbreviated set recorded in London's ""Hard Rock Cafe,"" a decidedly cramped venue, which begets a more intimate and slower show than normal. It has terrible acoustics and while it might appeal to people who always wanted to see Deep Purple in a nightclub, the constraints of the small room and bad sound quality didn't help me to enjoy the show. While I am normally a huge Steve Morse fan, I was particularly unimpressed with his work during this gig, and especially his solo on ""Smoke on the Water.""After watching the concerts, I was honestly divided about how to rate this set, but for me the lengthy interviews in the extras took it over the top. These extras are divided into general subjects, and everyone gets a chance to speak. ""The Story of 'Smoke on the Water'"" interviews both Ians and Roger Glover about the casino fire and its aftermath. Roger explains how exactly they ended up at the Grand Hotel after being kicked out of the Pavilion; he goes on to detail how he thought up the song title and he and Ian came up with the rock classic very quickly. It's not groundbreaking for people who know the story, but it's compellingly told and fun to watch. There is a great segment on improvisation where all five are interviewed. If you have seen or heard multiple performances from these guys you know each is a bit different, which accounts for much of their charm I think. I enjoyed them discussing getting backed into a musical corner: Ian Paice says ""We call them horse's eyes"" because their eyes get really big on stage as they look at each other and think ""OK, what happens now?""There are several other segments that highlight relative newcomers Don Airey and Steve Morse: I particularly appreciated how Gillan spent so much time explaining how Morse reinvigorated the band and really helped it survive the tremendous upheaval after Blackmore's departure when Blackmore ""walked out in the middle of a tour and left us high and dry."" Besides that, Morse is an amazing guitarist and seems to be an all-around nice guy. There are also segments on Montreux and the Montreux Jazz Festival that are interesting, a segment called ""Ian Gillan's Voice,"" and ""Steve Morse's Wrist"" where he discusses breaking his wrist and playing with a cast on. (Though it's not covered here, he also ground down part of the back of his guitar to accommodate the cast.) It was quite agonizing to perform that way, but these guys just love to play.While there are other Deep Purple performances I prefer to these two shows, they are still worth watching (especially the Montreux performance) and the overall package is a delight. I recommend it to any fan.",5,Solid Deep Purple Performances Pushed Over The Top By Great Camera Work And Extras,1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,5181,"['am', 'fan', 'most', 'various', 'incarnations',

The video and sound is incredible, a real treat on my simple 5.1 system with HiDef monitor.For a bunch of old farts, DP still kicks some serius arse. I think Ian Gillan even blows a nut trying to sing Highway Star (and quickly runs back stage to re-group during the following instrumental). The band is spot on, all night, as Gillan joins mainstays Roger Glover, and Ian Paice, in addition to Don Airy on Keyboards and Steve Morse keeping the Blackmore feel alive.Excellent video editing, no flashing MTV 2-second bull crap here. The camera's pointing where it should, especially during solos, and stays there. The band is having fun, it's obvious throughout the concert, and you'll have fun following along with a bunch of old geezers rocking out to your heart's delight.",5,Old Geezers Deliver,1182902400,"06 27, 2007",2007,901,"['as', 'good', 'modern', 'DVD', 'concerts', 'getting', 'there', 'one', 'classic', 'hard', 'rock/metal', 'bands', 'history', 'video', 'sound', 'incredible', 'real', 'treat', 'simple', '5.1', 'system', 'HiDef', 'monitor.For', 'bunch', 'old', 'farts', 'DP', 'still', 'serius', 'arse', 'think', 'Ian', 'Gillan', 'even', 'nut', 'trying', 'sing', 'Highway', 'Star', 'quickly', 'runs', 'back', 'stage', 're-group', 'following', 'instrumental', 'band', 'spot', 'night', 'Gillan', 'mainstays', 'Roger', 'Glover', 'Ian', 'Paice', 'addition', 'Don', 'Airy', 'Keyboards', 'Steve', 'Morse', 'keeping', 'Blackmore', 'feel', 'alive.Excellent', 'video', 'editing', 'flashing', 'MTV', '2-second', 'bull', 'crap', 'here', 'camera', 'pointing', 'where', 'should', 'especially', 'solos', 'there', 'band', 'having', 'fun', 'obvious', 'concert', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fun', 'following', 'along', 'bunch', 'old', 'geezers', 'rocking', 'heart', 'delight']",N/A

I kept buying, because it was almost habit-like to buy the latest DP product.  No longer.  As musicians, all the members shine.  Especially Paice & Glover.  Morse has begun to bore me.  Airey is a wonder on the keyboards, but really adds nothing to the band.  Together, as a band, there is no longer any spark or passion in the playing.  Just a simple going through the motions play it safe feel to the performance.  Even the ROTD material, which sounds and feels better than on the studio recording, is nothing to get excited over.Deep Purple has been a part of my life since I first heard Pictures of Home from the Machine Head album.  I've enjoyed their music through the various Marks, including the Joe Lynn Turner line-up.  But no more.  I will not let them collect royalties from my purchase.
