11385,A13NM1PES9OXVN,0767812182,"Angela Mitchell ""Angela Mitchell""","[7, 9]","Thunderheart is a terrific movie, well worth the purchase price of a single DVD.  This film's a longtime favorite of mine -- one of those movies I watched when I was bored, and then was blown away by how deep, interesting, and resonant it was. I've seen the movie easily four or five times since and always find something new to notice.I love a lot of different things about it -- I love Ray's journey in this movie (and Val Kilmer is just wonderful in this role), the way his discoveries lessen his self-loathing -- and simultaneously humanize him and lessen his superiority toward others (particularly others of the Sioux tribe that he encounters). He begins as a cocky, unlikeable, jerk -- and then we see the scared little kid beneath the surface.The film's story is a great murder mystery -- but that's really just to give us a way into the action. It's also a wonderfully understated way of showing that what Ray hated wasn't what was in others, but what was within himself. The man in the beginning of this movie is about an inch deep -- he has rejected everything about himself, his family, his rich family history as the son of a halfblood Sioux. By the end of the movie, he's irrevocably changed -- a much more likeable and accessible person who no longer does things by the book, but by the heart.  Kilmer's performance is just so subtle -- you see it all in his face. There's a lot of humor, too, just when you least expect it.I also love the aura of the supernatural/spiritual that fills this movie, yet (to me) it's never hokey, but fresh, cool and really respectful. The spiritual is a big part of native American culture, and it's treated that way here, but without smarm or too much obviousness. I love Ray's unexpected visions, those ghostly moments in which animals truly seem to see things that are hidden.I also love every single scene Ray has with both Graham Green's character (and Graham Green just rocks -- he's amazing), as well as all his scenes with a brave local native American schoolteacher. I like that there's a hint of romance in the plot, as well, but that it's subtext, and remains in the background (no big romantic subplot). The entire final quarter of the film is just really moving to me.So many shots in this movie say everything without a word spoken. Even the very last shot of the film speaks volumes about what a different man Ray is now.A great movie, that has a lot to say.",4,"A surprisingly deep action flick, and one man's rejected past...",1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,2420,"['Thunderheart', 'terrific', 'movie', 'well', 'purchase', 'price', 'single', 'DVD', 'film', 'longtime', 'favorite', 'mine', 'one', 'movies', 'watched', 'when', 'was', 'bored', 'then', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'how', 'deep', 'interesting', 'resonant', 'was', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'easily', 'four', 'five', 'times', 'always', 'find', 'something', 'new', 'notice.I', 'love', 'lot', 'different', 'things', 'love', 'Ray', 'journey', 'movie', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'just', 'wonderful', 'role', 'way', 'discoveries', 'lessen', 'self-loathing', 'simultaneously', 'humanize', 'lessen', 'superiority', 'others', 'particularly', 'others', 'Sioux', 'tribe', 'cocky', 'unlikeable', 'jerk', 'then', 'see', 'scared', 'little', 'kid', 'surface.The', 'film', 'story', 'great', 'murder', 'mystery', 'really', 'just', 'give', 'way', 'action', 'also', 'wonderfully', 'understated', 'way', 'showing', 'what', 'Ray', 'hated', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'others', 'what', 'was', 'man', 'beginning', 'movie', 'inch', 'deep', 'rejected', 'everything', 'family', 'rich', 'family', 'history', 'son', 'halfblood', 'Sioux', 'end', 'movie', 'irrevocably', 'changed', 'much', 'more', 'likeable', 'accessible', 'person', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'things', 'book', 'heart', 'Kilmer', 'performance', 'just', 'so', 'subtle', 'see', 'face', 'lot', 'humor', 'too', 'just', 'when', 'least', 'expect', 'it.I', 'also', 'love', 'aura', 'supernatural/spiritual', 'movie', 'yet', 'never', 'hokey', 'fresh', 'cool', 'really', 'respectful', 'spiritual', 'big', 'part', 'native', 'American', 'culture', 'treated', 'way', 'here', 'smarm', 'too', 'much', 'obviousness', 'love', 'Ray', 'unexpected', 'visions', 'ghostly', 'moments', 'animals', 'truly', 'seem', 'see', 'things', 'are', 'also', 'love', 'single', 'scene', 'Ray', 'Graham', 'Green', 'character', 'Graham', 'Green', 'just', 'rocks', 'amazing', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'brave', 'local', 'native', 'American', 'schoolteacher', 'like', 'hint', 'romance', 'plot', 'as', 'well', 'subtext', 'background', 'big', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'entire', 'final', 'quarter', 'film', 'just', 'really', 'moving', 'me.So', 'many', 'shots', 'movie', 'say', 'everything', 'word', 'spoken', 'Even', 'very', 'last', 'shot', 'film', 'volumes', 'what', 'different', 'man', 'Ray', 'now.A', 'great', 'movie', 'lot', 'say']",N/A
11386,A3LKP6WPMP9UKX,0767812182,Anna V. Carroll,"[6, 7]","'Thunderheart' has a personal spot in my heart because I was adopted by Chief Ted Thin Elk (Grandpa Reaches) shortly after this film came out.  When I met him in SD I had not seen it, so when he said he was in the film I thought perhaps he was an extra.  I was stunned to see he WAS the film.  He told me the people involved with the film came to his humble home on The Rez one day and asked if he'd like to be in the movie.  He, too, thought he'd have a small part.  The film not only made him numerous fans all over the world, but it gave him a new lease on life.  He was able to use the royalties to help his family and friends.  In the years I was with him I learned so much about the Lakota people and their history.  He had only kind words for Val Kilmer and there was always a photo of the two of them in his living room.  I was able to tell Val Kilmer in person how much the Chief admired him.  I'm not sure how many people are aware Mr. Kilmer has Native American heritage in his family.  Johnny Depp is another Native American actor.  It is painful for me to watch this film when it comes on Cable because it reminds me of the happiest years of my life.  Chief Thin Elk passed away in January of 1997.  I have numerous photos from the movie in my apartment as well as numerous photos I took of him.  His last film, 'Walking Thunder' was also his co-star John Denver's last film.  They died within months of each other.  It's a wonderful film with a sad story to tell.  Unfortunately, the plight of the Lakota people in SD has not changed that much from when the film was made.  They are a proud, intelligent, strong and wonderful people.  I felt honored every day I lived with them.

I am not trying to be offensive, but it seems to me that every time a film involves Native Americans, all of the traits have to automatically be included. That's why The Last of the Mohicans was a refreshing film for a change. Graham Greene does a nice job of acting, and I like him in Thunderheart. There are so many incidents in the film that I disliked and thought were too outdated considering the year the film was made in. If I am let known that the film takes place in the 70's, okay fine I can accept that, but it is not. Really, Thunderheart is a Native American version of Mississippi Burning.

Based off of a number of events that happened in the mid seventies, you see the Leonard Peltier incident, the siege at Wounded Knee between Indians and Federal Agents and you see an approximation regarding the murder of Anna Mae Aquash because she was talking about uranium.  Graham Greene plays Walter Crow Horse, Val Kilmer is Agent Lavoi and former AIM Chairman, John Trudell - who was there for many of these events and then some - plays Jimmy Loooks Twice.  All are fabulous in their respective roles. This film gives a very good synopsis as to what First Nations peoples face to this day with regard to sovereignty, land rights, and just outright survival of both their culture and the People themselves.When you grow up in an Indigenous household and you saw these events being reported in the various tribal newspapers of the era as well as on the news or hearing your relatives talk about them, it realy hits home in a big way.

He arrives in South Dakota and is put under the tutelage of an independent FBI maverick played superbly by Sam Shepherd (All the Right Stuff, All the Pretty Horses). Often referred as the ""Washington Redskin"" by members of ARM, Kilmer is caught between two cultures. During the conflict, it's obvious that Shepherd is close to the leaders of the tribal council and its vigilante army. Kilmer, over time develops sympathies to the native culture and the people such as a grandfatherly Sioux who knows of Kilmer's past with a mystic ability that includes visions that he seems to pass on to Kilmer. Graham Greene (Dances with Wolves) serves as a reservation policeman who is Kilmer's bridge between the tribal council, his past and the traditional ways of the Sioux. Instead of a horse, Greene appropriately rides a motorcycle. Greene captures the split between past and present when he goes to pick up the body of a murder victim using his motorcycle pulling a traditional travois. Excellent acting by the entire case, particularly those that are actual Native Americans such as the naturally attractive Shelia Tousey playing Maggie Eagle Bear, are outstanding. Tousey plays a school teacher who sides with the traditionalists primarily to protect the health of the natives of the reservation. The on site location utilizes the badlands and what appears to be actual footage of the site of Wounded Knee that actually encompasses many of Kilmer's visions. The climatic ending is breath taking as the film pulls back to a far away shot taking in the effect  of the terrain that is beautiful in its ugliness.  Kilmer's relationship with the aging grandfather is touching and captures the mystic spirit of their unspoken communication that reveals things to Kilmer's character that he never knew or will ever forget. The film also captures some well timed humor, such as never put your hand in a hole in the ground expecting only to find the expected.  The cross between cultures is done very well and gives you a feeling that there is spirit in the Native American culture today.",5,Excellent Mystery and Action on the Rez: Kilmer's Best,1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,2660,"['excellent', 'action', 'site', 'location', 'film', 'turbulent', '70s', 'when', 'American', 'Indian', 'Movement', 'was', 'considered', 'violent', 'organization', 'Sioux', 'reservation', 'case', 'film', 'depicted', 'mid', 'late', '70', 'Indian', 'movement', 'group', 'called', 'ARM', 'What', 'billed', 'traditionalists', 'ARM', 'tribal', 'council', 'more', 'story', 'environmental', 'corruption', 'greed', 'Kilmer', 'sharp', 'young', 'FBI', 'go', 'getter', 'agent', 'assigned', 'reservation', 'conflict', 'record', 'Sioux', 'heritage', '25', '50', '%', 'purposely', 'forget', 'South', 'Dakota', 'put', 'tutelage', 'independent', 'FBI', 'maverick', 'played', 'superbly', 'Sam', 'Shepherd', 'Right', 'Stuff', 'Pretty', 'Horses', 'Often', 'referred', 'Washington', 'Redskin', 'members', 'ARM', 'Kilmer', 'caught', 'two', 'cultures', 'conflict', 'obvious', 'Shepherd', 'close', 'leaders', 'tribal', 'council', 'vigilante', 'army', 'Kilmer', 'time', 'sympathies', 'native', 'culture', 'people', 'such', 'grandfatherly', 'Sioux', 'who', 'Kilmer', 'past', 'mystic', 'ability', 'visions', 'pass', 'Kilmer', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'reservation', 'policeman', 'who', 'Kilmer', 'bridge', 'tribal', 'council', 'past', 'traditional', 'ways', 'Sioux', 'Instead', 'horse', 'Greene', 'appropriately', 'motorcycle', 'Greene', 'split', 'past', 'present', 'when', 'pick', 'up', 'body', 'murder', 'victim', 'using', 'motorcycle', 'pulling', 'traditional', 'travois', 'Excellent', 'acting', 'entire', 'case', 'particularly', 'are', 'actual', 'Native', 'Americans', 'such', 'naturally', 'attractive', 'Shelia', 'Tousey', 'playing', 'Maggie', 'Eagle', 'Bear', 'are', 'outstanding', 'Tousey', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'sides', 'traditionalists', 'primarily', 'protect', 'health', 'natives', 'reservation', 'site', 'location', 'badlands', 'what', 'be', 'actual', 'footage', 'site', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'actually', 'many', 'Kilmer', 'visions', 'climatic', 'ending', 'breath', 'taking', 'film', 'back', 'far', 'away', 'shot', 'taking', 'effect', 'terrain', 'beautiful', 'ugliness', 'Kilmer', 'relationship', 'aging', 'grandfather', 'touching', 'mystic', 'spirit', 'unspoken', 'communication', 'things', 'Kilmer', 'character', 'never', 'knew', 'will', 'ever', 'forget', 'film', 'also', 'well', 'timed', 'humor', 'such', 'never', 'put', 'hand', 'hole', 'ground', 'expecting', 'only', 'find', 'expected', 'cross', 'cultures', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'feeling', 'spirit', 'Native', 'American', 'culture', 'today']",N/A

Lie, kill, steal, cheat, etc. etc. I won't say that the Government did this for racial/genocidal reasons, but rather for greed... thus, I'm not subscribing to the notion that the &quot;evil white man did it.&quot; Afterall the government does those kinds of things to anyone and everyone indiscriminately, and not just to &quot;poor Indians.&quot; Nonetheless, it's pretty pathetic. In conclusion, the movie was well directed, the acting was good (Val Kilmer of Doors fame, and Graham Greene from Dances With Wolves), great cinematography, and a pretty good musical score.

Coler.(According to what I know, 2 fingers were severed to send the FBI in Wash.D.C. so they could confirm they were real.)It is ironic that in the case of Anna Mae Quash, the FBI had her hands severed to verify her identity, when she was already identified. The hands were sewn back on for the Burial. (Referred to as ""Making The Journey"")What's even more interesting is that actual AIM members were in the movie as cameos and someone I know of is Dennis Banks.When I was in the U.S. Secret Service in 1974-1977 I had occasion to run into some AIM members in Washington, D,.C. who were occupying the Department Of Interior Building and all the ""Feds"" were looking for Dennis Banks. It appeared some AIM members were hiding out in some local Churches.Later Banks had a meeting with Department Officials.(Note: Banks and others like Leonard Peltier were accused of killing 2 FBI agents in Pine Ridge South Dakota.[...] ) Peltier made incriminating comments about the FBI agents homicide and is in federal prison today.Over 10 years later, I was working in U.S. Customs and ran into an actor named Dennis Banks who was crossing the Border at San Ysidro. I'm pretty sure it was Dennis Banks cause I ran his name to see if he was still wanted and he came up ""negative"".To this day the U.S. Government has LIED and Mistreated the Native American Indians and this movie is a great example ofeven how the FBI was corrupted and manipulated by even one senior agent who was going to benefit thru the deaths of innocent Americans who were Indians.(See also Clear Cut (1991) With Graham Greene.

I've made pilgrimages there both around the time this film appeared and as recently as last week (I live in Texas). Anytime I am close to that area, Thunderheart is the first film that comes to mind, just as Dances With Wolves inevitably comes to mind when I'm in the Black Hills, just to the west.Thunderheart successfully combines the Lakota's modern 'Feds on the Rez' dilemmas with a wry, witty, ironic, laconic sense of Native American wisdom and mysticism. The film loosely and hauntingly combines the Leonard Peletier story (see ""Incident at Ogalala"" and/or read Peter Matthiessen's book ""In the Spirit of Crazy Horse"") with implications and memories of the Wounded Knee tragedy and the plight of a dispossessed and plundered people.Kilmer and Sheppard get top billing, and both are good, but really, Graham Greene steals the show. His sassy, kick the dirt, Lakota Charlie Chan detective is priceless. Thunderheart conveys the sinister reality of the present along with a triumpant confrontation for which those of us who care about the plight of the Plains Indians certainly hope.

He inadvertantly rediscovers his true spiritual heritage as his soul slowly awakens to everything around him in a relentless series of baffling and inexplicable occurances that coax him toward his unforeseen purpose.For once, he finds himself listening to his own inner voice and the ghost dancing kindred spirits trying to reach his soul from beyond, calling to him from their graves with dangerous visions.He becomes powerless to thwart his inescapable destiny. All of this amid the shanty rust, distrust, derelict vehicles and abandoned souls that comprise the barren reservation he has hesitantly invaded.A couple of perceptive residents come to know that he is there for a ordained purpose and they somehow recognize what his presence actually represents to the Oglala nation.This film is loosely based on true incidents that occured in the 1970's at numerous reservations.There is a strangely haunting and mesmerizing score by James Horner.Masterfully filmed on location, the cinematography is vividly breathtaking.

11432,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,0767812182,Mr. Cairene,"[43, 43]","A low profile but vicious war is being waged on the Oglala Sioux reservation in South Dakota, on one hand there are the &quot;traditionalists&quot; who are adamant on protecting their culture, on  the other are the pro-governement natives led by a particulary nasty man  called John Milton (Fred Ward). This war results in a murder of Leo Fast  Elk, a native who was also a council member. Due to the sensitivity if the  case the FBI does the PC thing and sends a one fourth Indian agent named  Roy Levoi (Val Kilmer). The first hint that the this won't be another run  of the mill thriller is the Roy Levoi character, he isn't your average  hero, infact he is no hero at all. When we first see him he is a &quot;by  the book&quot; FBI man, and the film more then anything else is the story  of how he wrestles with and discovers his true identity. Kilmer's  performance is both subtle and superb.Good thrillers keep us  guessing for the truth, great thrillers like Peter Weir's WITNESS and Jim  Mcbride's THE BIG EASY are more concerned with the atmosphere and cultural  quirks of the characters. Thunderheart is very nearly a great thriller,  more concerned with the thematic and moral implications of the Indian  tribal wars then using Indians for atmosphere. There is a real sense of  discovery in watching this film, an attention to detail that gives it the  credibilty to survive the rules of the thriller. There is also undercurrent  supernatural element (actually spiritual would be more accurate) that is  handled with subtlety and grace by the director.Hitchcock said there  is no suspense in the boom, only the anticipation of one. As a result most  thrillers have to survive their endings. Although on reflection  Thunderheart's ending seems improbable, during the film you are carried by  its momentum that you don't mind.The title of this review refers  to one character's desciption of the native Indians in the U.S. . This is  the most fascinating thing for me about the film, the thin line between  cultural protection and xenophobia. The violence the almost certainly  errupts when different cultures collide. Although the film is clearly on  the Sioux's side (and correctly so), the larger subject is fascinating.Micheal Apted's recent films always seem to fall short of their alluring  premises, both Nell and Extreme Measure were solid but lacking something.

""Thunderheart"" was released in 1992 and based on several incidents on reservations.FBI Agent Ray Levoi (Kilmer) was called in to the Oglala Sioux Reservation on special assignment because he's part Sioux Indian himself and the Bureau figured he'd fit in.  No further from the truth, Ray quickly learns there's a big difference between a city Indian and a rez one -- and the rez is definitely a whole different world.The issue is civil war on the Sioux Reservation.  A fight's been brewing the last 100 years over traditional Indians versus US Government supporting Indians. When Levoi first arrives, he believes the troublemakers are the traditionals who are deemed rebels by his bosses at the FBI, but as he delves deeper into Sioux culture and his own past, he begins to realize the issues are far deeper than he ever imagined.Along the way, he teams up with rez cop, Walter Crow Horse (Graham Greene) and Grandpa Sam Reaches (Ted Thin Elk) to learn more about his past and his culture.Overall, the performances on ""Thunderheart"" are excellent.

We all thought the first big Indian film would be from one of Tony Hillerman's books, but Hillerman's movie Skinwalkers, moved slowly (but quite nicely) and so Thunderheart beat it to the finish line.Thunderheart is a nice film. Not great, but a good solid piece of work. The script is tight, with only a few moments of cliche, and, of course, the sheer barren expanse of the reservation dominates the film. (I always wonder why, in all those car chases across all those vast distances, no one ever runs out of gas. But that's another story.)The real joy of Thunderheart, however, is Graham Greene's performance as the Indian policeman. There is something utterly complete about Greene. He's one of our great actors and he never, ever, EVER gets enough credit. Perhaps it's the quietly sardonic quality of his voice. (Greene fans: check out his performance in Maverick and in the short-lived television series, Wolf Lake.) In any case, he puts in yet another powerful performance in Thunderheart as the voice of the &quot;modern&quot; traditional Indian. His lament over never having had a vision while some &quot;instant Indian&quot; (Kilmer) gets his own vision of running with the old ones, is truly moving.All in all, Thunderheart may not be a great film, but it certainly is a damn good one.",4,"Fun, and some truly haunting moments -- and Graham Greene!",1060473600,"08 10, 2003",2003,1404,"['heat', 'rediscovery', 'American', 'Indians', 'Thunderheart', 'was', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'first', 'film', 'out', 'thought', 'first', 'big', 'Indian', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'Tony', 'Hillerman', 'books', 'Hillerman', 'movie', 'Skinwalkers', 'moved', 'slowly', 'quite', 'nicely', 'so', 'Thunderheart', 'beat', 'finish', 'line.Thunderheart', 'nice', 'film', 'Not', 'great', 'good', 'solid', 'piece', 'work', 'script', 'tight', 'only', 'few', 'moments', 'cliche', 'course', 'sheer', 'barren', 'expanse', 'reservation', 'film', 'always', 'wonder', 'why', 'car', 'chases', 'vast', 'distances', 'one', 'ever', 'gas', 'story', 'real', 'joy', 'Thunderheart', 'however', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'performance', 'Indian', 'policeman', 'something', 'utterly', 'complete', 'Greene', 'one', 'great', 'actors', 'never', 'ever', 'EVER', 'enough', 'credit', 'Perhaps', 'quietly', 'sardonic', 'quality', 'voice', 'Greene', 'fans', 'check', 'out', 'performance', 'Maverick', 'short-lived', 'television', 'series', 'Wolf', 'Lake', 'case', 'yet', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Thunderheart', 'voice', 'quot', 'modern', 'quot', 'traditional', 'Indian', 'lament', 'never', 'having', 'had', 'vision', 'quot', 'instant', 'Indian', 'quot', 'Kilmer', 'own', 'vision', 'running', 'old', 'ones', 'truly', 'moving.All', 'Thunderheart', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'certainly', 'damn', 'good', 'one']",N/A
11445,A2WSI8HOWHFDOT,0767812182,Rocco Dormarunno,"[104, 107]","Time over time, Val Kilmer has proven that he is not just a pretty face. He has continually impressed even the most severe critics that he is a formidable actor. THUNDERHEART, to me, is among his best performances.There is some predictability in the plot: Kilmer portrays an FBI agent who is part Native-American. When he is sent to a reservation to investigate a crime, he begins to respect and embrace the heritage he had not previously acknowledged. What is not predictable, however, is how well the script avoids sentiment and focuses on Kilmer's transformation.Loosely based on the actual events surrounding Leonard Peltier's American Indian Movement, and the murders of FBI agents on the Pine Ridge reservation (all of which is the subject of Peter Matthiessen's book &quot;In the Spirit of Crazy Horse&quot;), THUNDERHEART is a powerful examination of the surreal and frightening life on Native American reservations. Brutality is everywhere: whites against Indians, Indians against Indians, etc. Director Michael Apted does a remarkable job of tempering the violence with scenes of beauty and with images of a peace-loving tribe of people. This is a heartbreaking film at times, but there is a sense of justice in the long-run. THUNDEHEART is not a piece of hunk-actor mind candy. This is a powerful (and underrated) film that demands your attention.

11449,ANEDXRFDZDL18,0767812182,Serene Night,"[1, 1]","Thunderheart is the story of a straight-laced FBI agent Ray Levoi (Val Kilmer), who has been sent to investigate a murder on a reservation. Chosen because he is 1/4 Sioux, Ray has spent his life denying his Indian roots, however, on the Res, Ray is forced to come face to face with his heritage, and the conflicts the Natives feel towards the government and 'white' society. When the evidence points towards a militant Indian group called ARM, Ray begins to believe the case might soon be settled. But, things are not what they seem,  and soon Ray and his newfound friends are enveloped in a wave of crime and governmental conspiracy.This is my second viewing of Thunderheart, and I liked it. While the initial plot starts off strong, the question of 'who murdered' the victim, soon is eclipsed by: &quot;Ray discovers his Indian roots,&quot; and while I did enjoy this part, I would've preferred a little more investigation and a little less 'clueless city boy, discovers the wonders of country living,' also, I do feel that it petered out a half-way towards the end, and the villain wasn't really much of a surprise. On the plus side, I DID think  Val did a good job playing the conflicted FBI agent Ray, and the supporting cast Graham Greene, Same Shepard, et all did an excellent job.I consider this film a solid 4 stars.

Ray,"[1, 1]","The DVD transfer is very good to excellent.In a movie that could have become an incoherent, confused mix of multiple storylines, screenwriter John Fusco and director Michael Apted have brilliantly assembled a provoctive film which never fails to keep the viewer thoroughly involved.  The story begins with an FBI agent sent to North Dakota to help solve a murder on an Indian reservation.  Val Kilmer is the agent whose Sioux heritage is the motivation for the assignment.  His partner, Agent Frank Coutelle (Sam Shepard), seems to be all business.  The conflict on the reservation seems to be a political situation.  The murder of an Indian involved with ARM (Aboriginal Rights Movement) seems to be just another case of politics carried to the extreme.As the story unfolds, we see Agent Ray Levoi (Kilmer) being pulled into a deeper look at his own life and heritage through an old Indian medicine man played by Granpa Sam Reaches.  The FBI begins to look a little less like the protectors and more like a bureaucratic agency willing to sweep the truth away in the name of expediency.  Look for a superb performance from Graham Greene (as Walter Crow Horse) as a Reseveration policeman  trying to get at the truth but struggling with the Feds and the Indian group aligned with them at every turn.  The blending of Indian Religion into the story is skillfuly done so as not to overwhelm the movie with its influence. That religion is given just the right impact to motivate the protagonist in his personal search for himself.  The assemble cast is perfect.If you haven't seen this film, do yourselves a favor and watch it.  I promise you won't be disappointed.Highly recommended for teens and up, especially those who like:  Crime dramas, journeys of personal discovery, and a symphatic look at the American Indian in modern America.
