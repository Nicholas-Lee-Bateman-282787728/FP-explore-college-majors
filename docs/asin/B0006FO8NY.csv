It seems to be a mix of a cinematic story line and reality during the time period in which it is set, pre-automobiles.  I have not read the book this movie is supposedly based on, so I cannot compare the book and the movie.Here are my thoughts on the movie: it is depressing.  I waited for some sign that the screen writer would somehow change the course of the movie and show humanity in a better light.  It never did - the jilted soon to be ex-wife of Olivier's character is a good example; her selfish desire to totally destroy her husband was eventually realized.  The transition of Jennifer Jones' character from a dependent, insecure country girl to a successful performer is not explained (portrayed) well, if at all.  The viewer gains no meaningful insight into what it must have cost the shy woman to go from bashful country bumpkin to highly ""sophisticated"" and admired performer.  The struggle of Laurence Olivier's character is better portrayed, probably mostly because of the skills of Mr. Olivier.  Yet the path of his character's decent into poverty and doom is not dealt with much, either.  This would have been a much better movie had the transitions of the character's success (Jones' character) and demise (Olivier's character) been developed more; the success of one and demise of the other are the obvious overall themes of the movie and deserved more from the director.Everything considered, I did not like the movie much; at times I gave it two stars (did not like it) and, at other times, three stars (it was barely OK).  Toward the end, my mind ended up with a ""did not like it,"" thus, only two stars.",2,"Depressing, lacking depth in certain parts...",1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,1758,"['Someone', 'here', 'wrote', 'great', 'look', 'time', 'period', 'movie', 'set', 'perhaps', 'perhaps', 'not', 'be', 'mix', 'cinematic', 'story', 'line', 'reality', 'time', 'period', 'set', 'pre-automobiles', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'supposedly', 'based', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'book', 'movie.Here', 'are', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'depressing', 'waited', 'sign', 'screen', 'writer', 'would', 'somehow', 'change', 'course', 'movie', 'show', 'humanity', 'better', 'light', 'never', 'did', 'jilted', 'soon', 'be', 'ex-wife', 'Olivier', 'character', 'good', 'example', 'selfish', 'desire', 'totally', 'destroy', 'husband', 'was', 'eventually', 'realized', 'transition', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'character', 'dependent', 'insecure', 'country', 'girl', 'successful', 'performer', 'not', 'explained', 'portrayed', 'well', 'viewer', 'gains', 'meaningful', 'insight', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'cost', 'shy', 'woman', 'go', 'bashful', 'country', 'bumpkin', 'highly', 'sophisticated', 'admired', 'performer', 'struggle', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'character', 'better', 'portrayed', 'probably', 'mostly', 'skills', 'Mr.', 'Olivier', 'path', 'character', 'decent', 'poverty', 'doom', 'not', 'dealt', 'much', 'either', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'had', 'transitions', 'character', 'success', 'Jones', 'character', 'demise', 'Olivier', 'character', 'been', 'developed', 'more', 'success', 'one', 'demise', 'other', 'are', 'obvious', 'overall', 'themes', 'movie', 'deserved', 'more', 'director.Everything', 'considered', 'did', 'not', 'movie', 'much', 'times', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'did', 'not', 'other', 'times', 'three', 'stars', 'was', 'barely', 'OK', 'end', 'mind', 'ended', 'up', 'did', 'not', 'thus', 'only', 'two', 'stars']",N/A

He is a wealthy restaurant co-owner, forgoing all his wealth and estate, divorcing his wife for just one country girl Carrie (Jennifer Jones) and began his miserable story.  The story itself is well developed, with every moment of highs and lows well positioned to catch the audience hearts and minds.

(I love classic movies, but Laurence Olivier is not someone I follow, before anyone who is a fan gets mad at me for this review!) For someone who only made about 25 movies, it is incredible how Jennifer Jones always managed to get such high-quality pictures. The only one I did not like, which appeared to be low-quality, was ""Indiscretion of an American Wife."" (There are about 5 movies I have not yet seen.)This movie... how could she possibly choose Olivier over Eddie Albert?? Now, this is saying nothing about his acting ability, which in this role was superb. But he smiled perhaps twice in the entire movie, and Eddie was just so cheerful. He was very direct in his interest in Jones's character. For that day and age, I can see how that would make a woman uncomfortable. He didn't give her much of a chance to say no. But to me, she didn't seem to be too happy when she was with either of them. It still made for a very interesting story though. It is by no means my favorite Jennifer Jones movie. That goes toPortrait of Jennie,Love Letters [VHS], andThe Towering Inferno (Special Edition)... just to start.*SLIGHT SPOILER* We feel so bad for Olivier's character because he is so disheveled and looks like a bum, because he has lost his money. Jones's character is horrified. It is awful. But does he really look so bad? By today's standards? His face looks exactly like half of all men who go out in public: scruffy and unshaven. And his clothes are BETTER! Today guys wear jeans and t-shirts. If we are lucky, their jeans are covering their butt-crack. THAT is horrifying, I think. I know, this has nothing to do with the movie, which had a pretty important theme. But I do find it kind of sad that the lower-class of the past was better-dressed than the middle-class of today. You can see it in pretty much any old movie.(It is also too bad they did not keep the title ""Sister Carrie.""

Kara Russell ""Actress/Artist/Musician/Writer""","[12, 12]","*** A bit of a spoiler, the package makes this look like a glossy romance, and it is much deeper and darker.***This movie really should have been called ""George,""as it is the story of a man (Laurence Oliver) who ruins his life for love.  Olivier is essentially different here, a humble man who suffers silently, simply wonderful, and shows here in his youth moments of the great acting of his last years (important, because he was aged up for this role).  It is a simply brilliant film for him.Jennifer Jones, playing Carrie, also gives one of her best performances, and their chemistry is fantastic.  She was in her 30s and still looks 18, which helps a film where she ages from about 18 to 36.I did not know anything of this ""girl comes to the big city, gets compromised, and rises above"" story.  It is far more than this trite outline.  This wonderful script dips and turns with the complexities of life relationships, legal relationships, and the things we don't tell each other.Miriam Hopkins, even in her perky youth, was always rather arch and tart.  This is used to fantastic advantage here in a very dislikable role.  Eddie Albert is also used to best advantage as a flirty traveling salesman and lady killer.In black and white, the story is about the divisions of poverty and wealth, and how life can take us through levels.  Edith Head's magnificent costuming takes the leads from highs to lows, tenements to townhouses to the glamour of the stage in the early 1900s.The score is by David Raksin, who did such memorable scores as WHIRLPOOL, THE BIG COMBO, FALLEN ANGEL, and PAT AND MIKE.  While heavy handed by today's standards, it is musically complex and eloquent, and truly augments the emotional journey of the action.  It is some of the best of it's time, evocative of the dissonant soundtracks of ON THE WATERFRONT, and REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.The realeased film had a section removed set in poverty row/homeless men's housing.  This section has been restored on the DVD, which reinstates yet another level of complexity, the mixture of poverty, humiliation and pride.All this makes this film wrenching, memorable and complete.

Michael Click,"[22, 23]","Movie: *****  DVD Quality: ***  DVD Extras: N/AA tour de force performance by Laurence Olivier distinguishes this screen adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's novel ""Sister Carrie"". Under William Wyler's sure-handed direction, Olivier portrays a middle aged man whose comfortable, but unhappy, life tragically unravels when he persues the love of a young woman in a desperate last attempt at personal happiness. Sabotaged by fate, circumstance, and his own compromised morality, Olivier's descent into poverty, isolation, and despair is harrowing to witness. As the object of his passion, Jennifer Jones is very good indeed in the title role. Certainly, she has never appeared more lovely than she does in this film; it is critical that the audience believe that Olivier's character would risk everything for her, and sure enough, one can easily understand why Olivier is captivated by her charm and grace.  Equally effective in key supporting roles are Miriam Hopkins in the role of Olivier's controlling shrew of a wife and Eddie Albert as a smooth-talking salesman who also loves Jones in his own opportunistic way.The Paramount DVD edition of this neglected jewel is a mixed bag quality-wise.  On the one hand, it includes a long-censored and important sequence showing Olivier's character at his lowest, sick and disheveled and destitute, spending the night in a filthy flophouse.  On the other hand, the transfer quality is uniformly substandard, featuring gainy video that is sometimes plagued by vertical lines running through the picture, and often muddy audio.  Regrettably, the DVD does not include any extras whatsoever, not even a package insert with liner notes.

Today it is viewed as a major American classic. Dreiser's characters are victims of chance and circumstance and their motivations are fueled by their desires without serious thought to the consequences of their actions. Readers were especially shocked that the heroine's ""sinful"" ways would be rewarded in the end.""Carrie"" was filmed in 1950 but it sat on the shelf for two years before being released in 1952. The studio felt that the political climate at the time wasn't right for the film. In fact, this dvd version contains a scene that wasn't included in the American release but was in prints for the foreign markets. A note at the beginning of the film alludes to the politics of the time but really it just raises more questions than answers. This is a film begging for a commentary but unfortunately there isn't one.With no extras provided, we only have the film to enjoy but what an excellent film this is. The technical aspects are top notch with William Wyler's skillful direction making this one of his best films, Victor Milner's sharp and unsentimental black and white photography and David Raskin's lovely score. But what really shines are the actors. Jennifer Jones, certainly one of the most beautiful actresses to ever work in Hollywood, is perfect as Carrie - naive and innocent in the beginning but learning the ways of the world too late, Eddie Albert as the charming but oily Drouet and Miriam Hopkins as the icy and shrewd Julia Hurstwood. The stand out performance, however, has to be Laurence Olivier, as George Hurstwood, the man whose obsession for Carrie eventually leads to his downfall.

The time period is the 1890s.She is beautiful and elegant despite her rustic fashion; plain white high necked blouse and drab skirt, as she tries to succeed in various factory jobs that are much too rigorous for her.  She meets up with Charlie Druea (Eddie Albert) who is a salesman on the make, though very much taken with her beauty and shy allure.  He invites her to move into his apartment, after her sister disapproves of her taking money from him after losing her job in a shoe factory. They set up housekeeping together.  In the neighborhood is Fitzgerald&#8217;s Restaurant, which caters to an elite clientele.  The restaurant is managed by George Hearstwood (Laurence Olivier), a gentleman in every way, although married to a social climbing, evil spouse, (Miriam Hopkins).Carrie and Charlie dine at Fitzgerald's shortly after Carrie moves in with Charlie. She is very taken with George Hearstwood because he possesses all the qualities she is looking for in a man; someone with class and dignity, who knows how to treat a woman. Charlie invites George to take Carrie to the theater when he goes out of town on a sales trip.Carrie is soon in love with George and they end up running away to New York City together although he hasn't the nerve to tell Carrie he cannot obtain a divorce from his wife and has a large sum of money on his person from Fitzgerald's.The remainder of the film shows the demise of George. He has paid back the money he owed Fitzgerald but the rumors of his thievery have travelled as far as New York. He is doomed to failure in every attempt he makes to succeed.Ashamed of his status as a failure, he leaves Carrie alone in their shabby little flat. But Carrie does not give up or go back to her parent's farm.  She tries out for a theatrical production bit part and we see her ascending the ladder to fame and fortune, with her name and photograph on the Theater Marquees. Now she is more beautiful than ever, in her velvet and fur trimmed dresses and hats.George finds his way back to her at the stage door one evening, but only to ask for a small handout to eat something in order to survive.Carrie wants him to stay with her and leaves him momentarily to run across the street to an open all night bistro for food.But George is gone, fading back into shadows, and most likely meeting his end....They were ill fated lovers....right for each other? Alas, they met at the wrong time...and as Carrie says in one of her earlier scenes with George,  &#34;I should have met you sooner, but I didn't, and now I'm not free.&#34;Carrie will never be free herself...for she will regret having ruined George's life.
