I will admit, this was the primary reason I picked up this DVD.  In short, I certainly was not disappointed!!  First off, Elle looks absolutely magnificent in the nude, and that's a good thing as she's naked through much of the film.  This, of course, is not surprising given her background as a world famous Supermodel.  What IS surprising is that she has a natural screen presence that I was not anticipating.  Way to go, Elle!!!The story takes place in Australia around 1911 and centers around a woman named Estella (played by Tara Fitzgerald).  Going to Australia is somewhat like Alice going down the rabbit hole.  In this case, Estella is exposed to a wonderland of erotica.  In mythological stories about sirens, it is men (usually sailors) who are seduced by sirens.  {And, of course, this usually leads to their doom.}  In this case,  it is a woman who falls into a trance under their gaze.  Estella experiences a sexual awakening and partakes in every sort of debauchery;  voyeurism, exhibitioninism, group sex, lesbian sex, BDSM ~ she is introduced to all of it!!In spite of how &#34;wild&#34; the film souns, it maintains its surreal tone, like a pleasant dream.  That, of course, seems to be the whole point.

Tara Fitzgerald is also great as his  wife who gets caught up in all that sexuality. And Sam Neill does a good  job as the painter who stirs it all up.

The real theme of the movie, unless I completely missed the point, is the spiritual damage, if not emotional damage, that sexual repression exerts on the individual (and society, if one takes the logic a step further).Set in the 1930's, a catholic priest is sent to compel a famous artist from displaying an erotic painting that mixes religious with erotic themes that the church finds offensive.  This repressed priest and his wife find themselves in the midst of an almost bacchanalian atmosphere, as the artist's models cavort around in a carefree, playful, sexually liberated manner.  The real focus the movie really becomes the priest's wife, who starts to find herself drawn into experiences around her and frees herself of her own repressions.The drawback to the movie is it's just not that entertaining and has no real plot.

In the 1920's, a smug young minister seeks to climb the church's political ladder by succeeding on a mission to Australia to dissuade an artist from exhibiting work considered lascivious.  Transportation plans go awry and the minister and his proper young wife are marooned in the exquisite Outback with the artist and his often nude models.  By the time they leave, the minister has lost the battle with the artist and his wife has sampled the Bohemian life and learned a few things.

The film is beautifully filmed, the backdrop of Australia is wonderful, and the themes of the movie are highly relevent and fascinating.  This is a movie about the conflict between repression and freedom, especially artistic freedom and also freedom of women to express themselves.Hugh Grant plays a minister sent to the outback to convince an unconventional and controversial painter to withdraw a picture that the religious authorities are appalled by...which is part of the point of why the artist created it and entered it into the show in the first place.  He is shocked by what he finds--both in the artist's wife and her modern and free sensibilities and in the artist's lovely, innocent and yet wise, models.  I say innocent yet wise because they are free in a sexual sense, yet they are also free in having escaped from the repressive views of women and sex of the time.The minister's subdued wife becomes fascinated by these women and also by another man, with obvious results and consequences both to her life and to their marriage.  To be honest, this movie is more about her journey than it is about her husbands.  You also see the difficulties when the freedom of the ""Sirens"" comes into conflict with the narrow-minded views of what a good woman and morality should be.As the movie progresses, you see the artist's visions and love of women as they come to life.  Still, this is not just a movie about naked idyllic scenes...as the movie continues to return again and again to the idea of the reality of whether Sin exists or if it is just a human invention to try to control people, especially women.

Like one or two other men, I have a weakness for the female human body, which the audience is tastefully treated to throughout the film.  I like Elle MacPherson in it, even moreso after I found out that she gained weight for the role and pulled off a very decent performance to boot (also, I disagree with a previous reviewer that considered her looking anything but at her best; I think she looks fabulous with the less-anorexic look).  And finally, I like the film's underlying themes and philosophies and lighthearted tones, which reflect the way I also prefer to see the world and make for pleasant viewing.So why only three stars?  The DVD is frankly horrid.  The film is presented only in standard, not widescreen.  The picture quality itself is really quite noticeably poor (for DVD).  There are no language selections at all aside from English.  There are no subtitles available at all, for any language.

81799,A2DSXA1E02C86D,0788815717,Joseph Haschka,"[21, 21]","SIRENS, released in 1993, is a beguiling film that pokes fun at the sexual repression that may result from an overactive religious zeal. Hugh Grant, as the Anglican minister Anthony Champion newly arrived in early 20th century Australia, is asked by the bishop to pay a call on a local artist, Norman Lindsay, and to beseech him to withdraw from exhibition a painting considered scandalous. Horror of horrors, it includes bare-naked ladies.Anthony and his young spouse Estella, played by Tara Fitzgerald, arrive at Lindsay's estate to find the artist, portrayed by Sam Neill, busily painting away. Norman's earthy wife and three resident female models serve as his inspiration, and clothing on the four is, more oft than not, unabashedly optional. This in-your-face display of live, nubile flesh leaves the Reverend rather tongue-tied and confused (as only Grant can play it). At first, wife Estella shares her husband's righteous indignation. Then, the lush, humid, tropical surroundings and free-spirited lifestyle of the Lindsay estate, along with the presence of a hunky handyman, begin to work their liberating magic on her repressed desires. (A very nice touch is the representation of Temptation as a large serpent that slithers through occasional scenes unnoticed by anyone but the viewer.)It all sounds potentially raunchy, but never is. Rather than being a manipulative, licentious debauchee, Neill's on-screen persona is one of an amused, live and let live observer of human nature - a sort of detached Hugh Hefner. There's an abundance of casual nudity, but it's almost artistically presented. The sexual nature of a couple scenes is more sensuous than bawdy. And, one of this film's undeniable attractions is real-life model Elle MacPherson, who plays the role of one of the uninhibited SIRENS, and who shows an eyeful. Boy, does she ever.

Here we have the Titanic, Atlantis, the Sirens, and Millais' Ophelia.  Tara Fitzgerald's character, the wife of an Anglican priest, is slowly drowning in the raw sensuousness of the 1920's Australian countryside and its people.  She and her husband (Hugh Grant) came there to confront a libertine artist (Sam Neil) about his provocative paintings.  But in the artist's adorable family, his three free-spirited models, the rough townsfolk, and the superlative natural setting, they get more than they bargained for.  These are all wonderfully rendered with steady direction and a gorgeous score.  As she `slips', she becomes aware of life's precious beauty, of death's finality, of her husband's love.

81816,A1NDYXBX0IAUAY,0788815717,Ronald L. Russell,"[19, 28]","I saw this movie when it was playing in theatres, and was pleased to find it available on DVD. Apparantly filmed at the actual home where Lindsay worked, the scenery is often quite breathtaking. It is based somewhat loosely on events surrounding the real Australian artist Norman Lindsay (played in the film by Sam Neill). Lindsay submits a controversial painting for display at an exhibition, and a newly trained minister (Hugh Grant), is sent to attempt to convince him to substitute another painting of a less radical nature.While spending several days as guests at the Lindsay home, the minister and his wife become acquainted with Lindsay, his family, and several models who live with him.The models (played by Elle MacPherson and a young Portia DeRossi) are frequently in various stages of nudity while posing for some of Lindsay's work, and their obvious comfort with their sexuality clashes with the conservative views of the minister and his wife. As their stay becomes longer, some of the liberal views of the household begin to appeal, first to the minister's wife, then, at the very end of the film, and in a very small way, to the minister himself.Thus, minds which were once closed to other views are seen to begin to open. The film works, not only as a quasi-historical account of real people, but as an allegory of how society often condemns non-conformists, and also how non-conformists often lead their societies toward enlightenment. In a sense, the film is a mirror of the overall direction that the society in which we live seems to moving, out of 'the dark ages' and toward a time of greater enlightenment.",5,Liberal and conservative worldviews constrasted.....,1028851200,"08 9, 2002",2002,1628,"['saw', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'playing', 'theatres', 'was', 'pleased', 'find', 'available', 'DVD', 'Apparantly', 'filmed', 'actual', 'home', 'where', 'Lindsay', 'worked', 'scenery', 'often', 'quite', 'breathtaking', 'based', 'somewhat', 'loosely', 'events', 'surrounding', 'real', 'Australian', 'artist', 'Norman', 'Lindsay', 'played', 'film', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Lindsay', 'controversial', 'painting', 'display', 'exhibition', 'newly', 'trained', 'minister', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'sent', 'attempt', 'convince', 'substitute', 'painting', 'less', 'radical', 'nature.While', 'spending', 'several', 'days', 'guests', 'Lindsay', 'home', 'minister', 'wife', 'become', 'acquainted', 'Lindsay', 'family', 'several', 'models', 'who', 'live', 'him.The', 'models', 'played', 'Elle', 'MacPherson', 'young', 'Portia', 'DeRossi', 'are', 'frequently', 'various', 'stages', 'nudity', 'posing', 'Lindsay', 'work', 'obvious', 'comfort', 'sexuality', 'clashes', 'conservative', 'views', 'minister', 'wife', 'stay', 'becomes', 'longer', 'liberal', 'views', 'household', 'begin', 'appeal', 'first', 'minister', 'wife', 'then', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'very', 'small', 'way', 'minister', 'himself.Thus', 'minds', 'were', 'once', 'closed', 'other', 'views', 'are', 'seen', 'begin', 'open', 'film', 'works', 'not', 'only', 'quasi-historical', 'account', 'real', 'people', 'allegory', 'how', 'society', 'often', 'non-conformists', 'also', 'how', 'non-conformists', 'often', 'lead', 'societies', 'enlightenment', 'sense', 'film', 'mirror', 'overall', 'direction', 'society', 'live', 'moving', ""'the"", 'dark', 'ages', 'time', 'greater', 'enlightenment']",N/A
