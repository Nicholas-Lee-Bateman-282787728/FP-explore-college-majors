The movie is however easy to find other places online, perhaps then Amazon will get a clue and get it into stock.Case 39 is about a child care social worker who are given the case of a young girl named Lillith Sullivan. The social worker Emily fears for the child's safety with her strange parents and later stops the parents from murdering Lillith. Emily wants to give the girl she just saved a safe place to recover until a permanent foster home can be found for her so she takes Lillith into her home. Soon things being to happen and innocent little Lillith turn out to be not so innocent after all, perhaps it is her parents and not Lillith who are the victims and now Emily is in danger to.Actually the plot of Case 39 reminds me allot of a story from horror comics later made into a movie in the Masters of Horror's series named Jennifer. I am not going to go into detail about that film as if you have seen it you will know what I am talking about when you see Case 39 and if you have not seen Jennifer then I do not want to spoil it for you.Anyway I really like Case 39. I know the movie have gotten generally bad reviews, but I enjoyed it. There is however some really big problems with the film. The phasing is all wrong, in places it is far to slow, and in other places thing are moving way to quickly. Basically up until the supernatural events begin to occur things are very slow, but once strange things start happening everything just seams to happen at once, destroying any suspense. Also I think that it is a bit strange that Emily so quickly being to think Lillith is evil, seriously most pepole will take some time to accept the supernatural as truth. Another weakness of the film is that we are never really given an explanation for what is going on, yes we are told what Lillith is, but not why she do the things she do.However all in all I think this is a good movie. The acting is good and the general plot of the film is interesting. However if you are looking for something to scare you then this movie is not very scary, you see it for the story and the acting not for jumps and scares.",4,Predictable but entertaining creepy kid movie.,1302307200,"04 9, 2011",2011,2292,"['can', 'not', 'believe', 'movie', 'not', 'sold', 'Amazon', 'have', 'kind', 'obscure', 'films', 'actually', 'have', 'several', 'famous', 'actors', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'here', 'movie', 'however', 'easy', 'find', 'other', 'places', 'online', 'perhaps', 'then', 'Amazon', 'will', 'get', 'clue', 'get', 'stock.Case', '39', 'child', 'care', 'social', 'worker', 'who', 'are', 'given', 'case', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Lillith', 'Sullivan', 'social', 'worker', 'Emily', 'child', 'safety', 'strange', 'parents', 'later', 'parents', 'murdering', 'Lillith', 'Emily', 'give', 'girl', 'just', 'saved', 'safe', 'place', 'recover', 'permanent', 'foster', 'home', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'so', 'Lillith', 'home', 'Soon', 'things', 'being', 'happen', 'innocent', 'little', 'Lillith', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'not', 'so', 'innocent', 'perhaps', 'parents', 'not', 'Lillith', 'who', 'are', 'victims', 'now', 'Emily', 'danger', 'to.Actually', 'plot', 'Case', '39', 'reminds', 'allot', 'story', 'horror', 'comics', 'later', 'made', 'movie', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'series', 'named', 'Jennifer', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'go', 'detail', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'when', 'see', 'Case', '39', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Jennifer', 'then', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'spoil', 'you.Anyway', 'really', 'Case', '39', 'know', 'movie', 'have', 'gotten', 'generally', 'bad', 'reviews', 'enjoyed', 'however', 'really', 'big', 'problems', 'film', 'phasing', 'wrong', 'places', 'far', 'slow', 'other', 'places', 'thing', 'are', 'moving', 'way', 'quickly', 'Basically', 'up', 'supernatural', 'events', 'begin', 'occur', 'things', 'are', 'very', 'slow', 'once', 'strange', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'everything', 'just', 'seams', 'happen', 'once', 'destroying', 'suspense', 'Also', 'think', 'bit', 'strange', 'Emily', 'so', 'quickly', 'being', 'think', 'Lillith', 'evil', 'seriously', 'most', 'pepole', 'will', 'take', 'time', 'accept', 'supernatural', 'truth', 'weakness', 'film', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'given', 'explanation', 'what', 'going', 'yes', 'are', 'told', 'what', 'Lillith', 'not', 'why', 'do', 'things', 'do.However', 'think', 'good', 'movie', 'acting', 'good', 'general', 'plot', 'film', 'interesting', 'However', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'scare', 'then', 'movie', 'not', 'very', 'scary', 'see', 'story', 'acting', 'not', 'jumps', 'scares']",N/A

1385154,A2PMQH87R1H3QU,B0044N94K6,Benjamin Kidman,"[1, 2]",Case 39 was a pleasant little surprise. The story was heavy with tension and did not hesitate to go all out with borderline offensive situations. I must say that I am impressed. While at times the story did feel like a close relative of the movie Orphan it proved overall to have enough of it's own unique personality to not distract or cause for a loss of enjoyment. Thankfully the more the movie progressed the more it distanced itself from Orphan. I typically find it hard to stomach Renee Zellweger but either she wasn't so bad in this film or the movie was good enough to cover for her.

1385155,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B0044N94K6,California Dreaming,"[1, 1]","I just watched the remake of ""Carrie"" -- you might legitimately ask, ""Which one?"" as there have been quite a few now -- and I give nothing away when I say that, at the beginning of the film, the director changed it up a bit from the original by showing the birth of Carrie, and almost the murder of that baby by her mother.  I watched the original ""Carrie"" about six months ago, and I have to admit that I can't remember how it started, although I believe that the remake was different.In ""Case 39,"" I give nothing away when I say that the parents of a child try to cook her alive in an oven during act one.  Well, in both films, lets just say that neither set of parents are successful in infanticide (or ""childcide""), which is important in the development of plot.  Naturally, if Carrie White dies she never gets to the prom.  If Lillith -- note the name, which is intended -- dies, then, well, we never have a Case 39 for Renee Zellweger to investigate.The reason why I am comparing and contrasting these two films is not that they necessarily have drastically different endings, but rather because they start out in similar fashions, but have differing paths to somewhat similar ends.  But the big difference really is that, while this film is not a ""twisteroo"" per se, it does turn the audiences' own belief system somewhat on its head as this film progresses.  Let's just say that in ""Case 39,"" the character that you root for flip-flops over the course of the film, while in ""Carrie,"" the protagonist mostly remains your same protagonist throughout, even though maybe you will fear that protagonist a bit more by the end.  In ""Case 39,"" it's hard to root for the initial protagonist throughout the film is all that I will say.I just watched this film again tonight (2014Jan26) as it was on ""free"" TV, and one item that really caught my attention on a second or third viewing:  I really liked how Lilith co-opted the language of social services, co-opted it for the purposes of making fun of it, of course.  Not only that, the viewer quickly realizes how ridiculous that language sounds, as it makes so many assumptions that even the speaker of it -- usually a social services worker -- could no way in hell believe the garbage herself.  ""Come on; walk the talk!"" would be but one very cheesy example.  But because of this, I am guessing that conservatives will enjoy this film more than liberals, but that is only a guess.Even though I gave the ""Carrie"" remake a 4, I gave it a very weak 4.  On the other hand, I'm giving this film a very strong 4.  I could go 5 here, except that I didn't much like the ending.  Oh, it's not that I hated it.  But I just think that, if one were to think about it for awhile, one could come up with a better ending without too much trouble.  But more than likely, there are alternate endings -- endings which I haven't seen -- and more than likely, the director actually shot multiple endings and hemmed and hawed as to which one that he would eventually use for the release version.Ultimately, I believe that there were some reasonable motivations for remaking ""Carrie,"" with the major reason being that it was made 40 years ago and special effects have greatly advanced since that timeframe.  I believe that this film was an original screenplay and was the first version, and if that is true, it surely had a greater reason to be made.But I will give the nod to the lead here (more than likely, this film positions Ms. Zelwegger as the lead, but that wouldn't be correct in my opinion) -- Jodelle Ferland -- over any of the Carries, be they Sissy Spacek, Chloe Moretz, or that other girl who was in that other remake.  As a matter of fact, I would say that Ms. Ferland is scarier here than Linda Blair was in the ""The Exorcist.""  Ms. Ferland certainly gives a better performance than Ms. Blair ever did.  ""Blasphemy!"" I can already hear, but hear me out:In the ""The Exorcist,"" all Ms. Blair had to do was lay around awhile and endure long makeup sessions, and then lay around some more and writhe.  The real acting was mostly done by the voice over, done by someone else.  And if you have ever seen Ms. Blair in later roles (watch ""Exorcist:  The Heretic,"" or better yet, do not, as that is probably the worst horror film of all time) or the roller skating film that she starred in, you will quickly realize that her acting was on the skill level of After School Specials.  Ms. Ferland, however, really holds her own here, and she will truly scare the hell out of you as her frights are more psychological.  Like I said in my ""Carrie"" review, it's too bad that the director of ""Twilight"" didn't give Ms. Ferland more than just bit parts.  She's surely better than many of the so-called stars in that near mess of a strange Vampire soap opera.Well, I hope that I've made my case for ""Case 39"" over ""Carrie,"" any one of them.  And I hope that I've made my case that Ms. Ferland is underrated.  And I further hope that directors and casting directors give her more substantial roles in the future.",4,"Better than any ""Carrie""",1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,5036,"['just', 'watched', 'remake',

At first, nobody seems to believe her, and when she finally convinces those close to her that the child may in fact be responsible for these sinister doings, it may be too late.Cooper and McShane are exceptional, and Zellweger does well with a sparse script.

She has some fine associates - psychologist Doug (Bradley Cooper in a fine performance), case manager Wayne (Adrian Lester), and detective Mike Barron (Ian McShane).  Emily takes on Case 39, a 10 year old child Lily (Jodelle Ferland) who seems to be terrified of her parents.  Emily visits the home, befriends Lily, then discovers that Lily's parents - especially father (Callum Keith Sullivan) - are attempting to kill her.  The parents are arrested and placed in a mental institution and out of a sense of duty and caring Emily manages to become the temporary foster parent of the deeply disturbed Lily.  It seems Lily has strange powers and those powers include discovering the basic fears of those around her and playing on those fears in a manner that has disastrous results. As Emily grows to understand Lily she sees the connection with evil incarnate and the remainder of the film is how Emily and the world deal with this creature from the dark world.Each of the actors makes the most of a script that has far too many holes in it: it seems that the writer (Ray Wright) and director (Christian Alvart) couldn't decide on whether they wanted to create a truly terrifying psychological drama or simply go off the deep end and opt for over the top CGI effects.  Zellweger manages to find fine screen chemistry with Cooper and McShane, but that doesn't make up for the seemingly endless chaos the film elects as its center.

I was into the story at first and wondered why it got such bad reviews, but towards the end it started to totally fall apart.

If you believe in the devil and that the devil can be a girl, then you may like this one.

And never answer her challenge: ""If you tell me what you fear I will tell you what I fear.""  Or in reverse order, but the result is the same.It is a good lesson to social workers any way. Social workers are there to keep dangerous cases and disturbing cases in the margin of society and they must not try to make them right and they must especially not try to get involved in them. Social Services stand for SS and that's all. You don't do no good there. You just keep those who cannot be productive within the limits of the social concentration camp known as welfare or social security, another famous SS institution. At least that's what Loic Wacquant from University of California at Berkeley would tell you.He will add, due to his perfect social Marxist training he got in France, Paris Sorbonne probably, like Angela Davis, that we have to rebel against the fascist plot of this capitalistic society that only wants to keep 20% of the social body, the 20% that cannot be productive, in a complete inferno that is called the prison system for males and social welfare for females and children, and to guarantee that you have films like this one or the Exorcist, or so many more, or Stephen King and Anne Rice, to entertain you into believing it is the only way we can contain devils, demons, Satan and Lucifer, cross my heart.

Her latest case - number 39 - is about two strange parents with a seemingly regular little girl - they attempt to murder her by baking (in an oven), and the girl is put up for adoption. Naturally, Renee petitions to become the new parent and the story starts.The trailer actually gives away most of the movie's major surprises and shock points, so needless to say, the little girl turns out to be a demon with pigtails and does the requisite threatening behavior and adult-type language moments we've come to expect. That's a shame, since The Orphan was a better version of the same thing. Although Case 39 has its moments, they're few and far between, with Act 2 seeing all the major characters being killed off, and Act 3 being a series of action set-pieces designed to kill the demon.

For myself, I saw a great deal of THE RING in this, though THE RING is a far more effective movie, the kind that can give an adult a sleepless night.The best casting in CASE 39 isn't Zellweger, who plays a passionate Social Worker, it's Jodelle Fernald, who plays Lillith, the little girl. Just as THE RING had it's protagonist Samarra (as in the story ""Death in Samarra"") CASE 39 has it's protagonist, Lillith. For anyone unfamiliar with the legend, Lillith was supposed to have been Adam's first wife. She was supposed to have abandoned him in the Garden of Eden, ultimately to transform into a demoness. If you know that tale, half of CASE 39 gives itself up as soon as we hear the little girl called by name.Still, we're not quite sure who the bad guy is, especially when Zellweger and a cop friend find Lillith's parents sealing her inside their kitchen oven in an attempt to kill her. This might bring to mind either ""Hansel and Gretel"" or Buchenwald. Either way, it's the best, most effective scene in the film. The parents are arrested for attempted murder, and Zellweger is quite unrealistically given custody of the child.All seems well, until people around Zellweger start getting strange calls (think the VCR tape in THE RING, again), that inspire them to kill others or themselves. Afterward, the film degenerates quickly into thorough predictablity.Worth watching once, there's nothing here to draw you back again.

Even tho it has nothing to do with The Oprhan in anyway, it's a movie that has enough similarities to call it a sequel in the way Halloween III was supposed to start the Halloween franchise on a roll of sequels that where just horror films with a simmilar tone, rather than a Captain Kirk Mime obsessed with knifes and his sister.This film see's Renee Zelwegger .... wait, wait, I know... look.... I'm not a fan of her either OK, I don't even like Harry Potter or Lord of The Rings, but she is tolerable in this film OK? She left her diary at home in this one so she's not making a kiddie flick or a romantic comedy here, so guys, stick around, it's not so bad. Ok so she plays a case worker, and shes already neck deep in 38 cases when her boss throws case 39 at her. A little girl named Lilith appears to have parents that are doing something very strange to Lilith. Emily (thats Renee Zellashwartzenegger) thinks something more than she can prove is going on in that house, but is told not to get involved in-case the parents sue for having no evidence. Low and behold Emily ignores protocol and interferes, just in time before something horrible happened to Lilith. Now the parents have been sent to a nuthouse and Emily finds herself taking custody of Lilith to begin a happy life together, or will they?Honestly, the casting choice in this film is something I would expect my Twilight loving wife to enjoy and not myself, but I found this one very interesting and entertaining right to the end. Again, if you like The Orphan, give this one a go, it's definitely a movie you would place in or next to The Orphan, and don't be surprised if one day the two films are sold together.

El-Hewie""","[0, 2]","The big dilemma of this movie is the way events were viewed from impossible perspectives.Form the perspective of a couple obsessed by killing their own child, the viewer could easily imagine a scenario of drug-induced psychosis, particularly when the two adults concerted the effort of committing crime with no remorse. That is followed by a gruesome murder of two adults by a minor who sounded too fragile to cause such upheaval. Then, another perspective rises that makes no sense. A social worker is struck with acute psychosis and illusion that led him to fight illusive insects to death. Thereafter, a fourth and unexplained suicide occurs from an entirely rational detective in his way to commit murder of the mysterious adopted foster girl.While the viewer attempts to link bizarre and separate crimes, the incarcerated father is struck with similar acute psychosis that led him to murder an inmate during dining. After the theater is emptied from many participants by the strange and unexplained death, the social worker who volunteered to host the traumatized foster girl was next in getting inflicted with acute psychotic illusion.As if all social workers and detectives have shared a contagious psychotic illness. By the time the viewer might have been led to believe that the foster girl was such a menace to society or was behind all mysterious deaths, events lead to the disturbed state of minds of many adults, not just one or two, or three. Thus, the child appears closer and closer to real, innocent, and helpless child in the face of disturbed psychotic adults, who appeared normal and sane actors all along, but suddenly exposed unexpected twist of insanity.In any event, the movie exposes the constant struggle of the human mind to maintain balance among such heinous and shocking traits of lethal aggression.",4,Confusing approach to psychoanalysis.,1285977600,"10 2, 2010",2010,1829,"['big', 'dilemma', 'movie', 'way', 'events', 'were', 'viewed', 'impossible', 'perspectives.Form', 'perspective', 'couple', 'obsessed', 'killing', 'own', 'child', 'viewer', 'could', 'easily', 'imagine', 'scenario', 'drug-induced', 'psychosis', 'particularly', 'when', 'two', 'adults', 'concerted', 'effort', 'committing', 'crime', 'remorse', 'followed', 'gruesome', 'murder', 'two', 'adults', 'minor', 'who', 'sounded', 'too', 'fragile', 'cause', 'such', 'upheaval', 'Then', 'perspective', 'sense', 'social', 'worker', 'struck', 'acute', 'psychosis', 'illusion', 'led', 'fight', 'illusive', 'insects', 'death', 'Thereafter', 'fourth', 'unexplained', 'suicide', 'entirely', 'rational', 'detective', 'way', 'commit', 'murder', 'mysterious', 'adopted', 'foster', 'viewer', 'attempts', 'link', 'bizarre', 'separate', 'crimes', 'incarcerated', 'father', 'struck', 'similar', 'acute', 'psychosis', 'led', 'murder', 'inmate', 'dining', 'theater', 'emptied', 'many', 'participants', 'strange', 'unexplained', 'death', 'social', 'worker', 'who', 'volunteered', 'host', 'traumatized', 'foster', 'girl', 'was', 'next', 'getting', 'inflicted', 'acute', 'psychotic', 'illusion.As', 'social', 'workers', 'detectives', 'have', 'shared', 'contagious', 'psychotic', 'illness', 'time', 'viewer', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'led', 'believe', 'foster', 'girl', 'was', 'such', 'menace', 'society', 'was', 'mysterious', 'deaths', 'events', 'lead', 'disturbed', 'state', 'minds', 'many', 'adults', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'Thus', 'child', 'closer', 'closer', 'real', 'innocent', 'helpless', 'child', 'face', 'disturbed', 'psychotic', 'adults', 'who', 'appeared', 'normal', 'sane', 'actors', 'along', 'suddenly', 'exposed', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'insanity.In', 'event', 'movie', 'constant', 'struggle', 'human', 'mind', 'maintain', 'balance', 'such', 'heinous', 'shocking', 'traits', 'lethal', 'aggression']",N/A

1385219,A2QDD6OWIAEBED,B0044N94K6,"Paul Aragon ""krakatoa1883""","[3, 5]","Case 39 really is an interesting case. It's an interesting case because of the way this film sat around in purgatory for three years in a state of perpetual post production. It's an interesting case because of the barrage of down right aweful reviews it received from the national media upon its initial release. I mean, this was suppose to be Bolero and Ishtar all over again. This was suppose to be a colossal dude on the scale of Patch Adams and The Waterboy. This film was supposedly so bad, that after viewing it I would have to consult a team of physicians and have my permanently tainted eyeballs donated to science, all so that they could make a preventitive pill that would save man kinds future generations. If what they where saying was true, then I would have to go on a strict regiment of diet and exercise for months on end just to survive the shock that this celluloid humiliation would inflict upon my body. Hell, their reports where so daggone dire that they had me running laps, lifting weights, and grappling a medicine ball 24-7, all so that I could build up enough endurance and constitution to stomach the utter shame that awaited me on this one diarrhea coated disc. If you think I am making this up, all you have to do is check Rotten Tomatoes to see Case 39's anemic 23% 1 star professional critic approval rating. I went into this film fully expecting to see something as unwatchable as Exorcist II The Heretic. Yet, instead of being slapped across the face with the stench of movie road kill, I was shocked to discover a rather palatable and entertaining horror movie that remained fun from start to finish. Instead of dealing with the embarrassment and disgust of another round of George Clooney Batman nipples, I found myself watching a pretty decent film with a surprisingly strong cast, visually appealing cinematography, and competent pacing, all of which prevented this film from ever becoming tedious and dull. Now, I am not about to proclaim this film as being some kind of lost misunderstood classic or anything. It is just a basic run of the mill generic evil kid from hell chiller, but as far as this kind of film goes, this one is a lot better then a lot of them out there.Connecting the dots: Act 1. This is like deja vu all over again.Basically you have this overworked child service case worker named Emily, played by Rene Zellweger, who's boss, played by Adrian Lester, gives her one case more then she can handle. She investigates the abused neglected girl featured in this new case and suspects that her parents might be off their collective rockers. Next she consults her boss, and her cop friend Detective Mark Barron, played by Ian McShane, deals with all the usual required red tape of institutional bureaucracy...All to make her look a little bit more like The Joan of Arc of The Child's Welfare Movement. Then out of building concern, she meets this young girl at her bus stop and supplies her with her personal cell phone number. Before you can finish microwaving a bag of popcorn, the girl calls back sounding completely frightened and asking for help. Naturally, this sends Rene Zellweger speeding off in her car on one of those 'race against time' scenes. She arrives just in a nick of time with Detective Mark Barron to save this ten year old girl from being baked in an oven by her crazed parents (Take that Little Miss. Hansel and Gretel). At first this little girl is sent to live in an orphange, but after a bit of sugary innocent kiddy begging, Emily decides to defy all the odds and adopt this precious little thing herself. Just like that, this supposedly sweet little child is safe in the bosom of Emily's modest pristine home.Connecting the dots: Act 2. The Devil dials a cell phone.For all of about five minutes things remain idealistic between the two of them, but then bad things start happening all around Emily. First one of the kids from a different case Emily is working on kills his parents. Then Emily's boyfriend, a child psychologist named Doug, played by Bradley Cooper, comes out of a one on one session with Emily's newly adopted daughter completely freaked out. This child had used her sinsiter forked tongue to turn the tables on Doug and make him the subject of their little psychoanalysis session. Before heading home to die under some rather crazy circumstances he let Emily know just how badly little miss Emily JR. made him feel. It is like one minute things where great and then the next Emily fully suspects her adopted daughter of being a monster and nobody will believe her. This to me is the biggest flaw of the film, because once we realized that her adopted sweetie is not a sweetie at all then the jig is up. Just ten minutes into the second act we already know that Case 39 is holding a hand full of jokers and you can take it from there. Perhapes the oddest bit of story illogic was the idea to have the devil child use a cell phone to call up the people who are going to die or kill under her influence. This must have been an oversight by the writer to involve Police Detective Mark Barron into the plot by having a traceable source he could fallow like phone records. After all, in any good paint by the numbers chiller you have to have the death of the meddling cop side character after a bit of cat and mouse foreplay. Stranger still, I just wrote a review in which a black dog, symbolic of death and famine in the old country, made a mysterious appearence. In Case 39 it's none other then a black dog that causes Detective Mark Barron's death. On a side note, I was actually attacked by a black dog myself almost a year ago to the day so there must be some kind of spooky connection here, but I'm not drunk enough right now to figure out what that might be.Connecting the dots: Act 3. Ode to Jodelle Ferland.Despite Case 39's predictability and all the blatant foreshadowing that continually happens in pairs, it is the cast that ultimately gives this film its passing grade. Since this story is about the mayhem caused by a rather naughtly little demon child, then it only goes to fallow that the most important member of the cast has to be that of the demon child herself. Luckily for us this roll just happens to be filled by none other then Jodelle Ferland herself. I have no idea what this young lady is like in real life, but I hear she is very girly and loves the color pink. It is just that once the script calls for her to act evil, she goes into whole nother dimension. Jodelle Ferland is so completely convincing as the demon in sheep's clothing that if I was in Emily's shoes I think I would of done all I could to form a blood pact with that little monster. I would of been all like."" Look here sweetie. Um, how about I give you complete run of the house, and you set it up so that I can provide us with everything we would ever need? In fact, how about you make it so that we can become filthy rich, and I will buy you your very own built in swimmin pool, a jungle gym, a hot tub, and steam room? Heck, with your super powers we could even have us our own personal cook and masseuse. In return, I will never try to poison you, and I will never ever get in your way about anything. I will always do what you want to do, and I will personally go out of my way to get you whatever you want morning noon and night. What do you say honey, do we have a deal?""However, since this is your standard chiller, and since the cat has been out of the bag since the beginning of the second act, the story line of course calls for Rene Zellweger to do battle with Jodelle Ferland in a fight to the death. One of them will live, one of them will die, and being a crowd pleaser that wouldn't have it any other way, we already know that Rene Zellweger will come out of this victorious. Think of this kind of film like a rollercoaster, you already know where you're going to end up, but it's the getting there that's all the fun.I rate this film just a hair over 3 stars.",3,Beware of

Playing out like an extended episode of the X-Files (without Chris Carter's gift for economical exposition), Case 39 presents yet another take on the possessed-child-from-hell scenario.  Complete with shrieks and screams, Renee' Zellweger does her best to battle with the unseen force inhabiting the little girl's body, but to no avail.Not only does the plot challenge us to suspend our belief in even a borderline rational story, it has the Zellweger character absolutely defying logic in her decision making.  Why does she take in this child?  Why does she experience murder upon murder, yet stay with the child?  Why does she answer the frickin' phone?  Why does she think burning down her house will extinguish the evil presence?  Why does she think the evil, once escaped from the burning house, will acquiesce and stay put in a submerged automobile trunk?  Oh, I get it!!  You have to DROWN the Devil!!While this movie is indeed suspenseful, it degenerates into yet another remake of The Exorcist, sans enough exposition to explain the genesis of the girl's possession.  Neither the nature and length of her possession, nor the extent and range of her powers are ever explained.  The director expects us to go along with the premise, content to enjoy the unbelievable ride.In the end CASE 39 is shallow and lacks even remote believability.

However, the preview of what the movie's about and what it's actually about are 2 different things. The basic premise is a social worker (Zellweger) gets cases of abused children and works with the families to bring them together or remove the children from the home. Then she gets an intriguing case of a little girl who's parents are very strange and almost threatening when she meets them.She talks to the little girl who seems terrified and knows she has to get this little girl out of that house and away from her parents. One night the little girl calls her, she races over there, and something pretty horrific is taking place. Parents arrested, little girl now has nowhere to go. So Zellweger takes her in until she can be placed in a good home with a good family.As the movie goes on, we see that the little innocent girl isn't so innocent at all. I won't say much more but the previews made this movie out to be a good paranormal type movie where a negative spirit is somehow attached to this little girl who follows her. It's not. There's definitely underlying factors and undertones but it's more of a creepy little girl we learn isn't as she seems.It's a psychological thriller on a somewhat supernatural level and is still a decent movie.

1385237,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B0044N94K6,Stuart Conover,"[3, 4]","Case 39 was directed by Christian Alvart (who has since also directed and released Pandorum) and written by Ray Wright (who just released The Crazies) and I feel that his mix of director and writer actually show full well with how the movie turned out. Christian Alvart put together a very solid looking movie just as he does in Pandorum and Ray Wright has written up a great concept that I just couldn't put both of my feet solidly behind as much as I really wanted to with the concept of the film. My only complaint with Alvart's work on this is he appears to go with the scares over building up suspense and with the plot of the film I believe this was a mistake.This story follows Emily Jenkins (Renee Zellweger,) a social worker who on a routine trip has found that a young girl Lilith (Jodelle Ferland) appears to be being abused by her parents; Edward (Callum Rennie) and Margaret (Kerry O'Malley.) I have to admit the first scene she has with meeting the couple is one of the stronger scenes in the film just with how unsettling off it was. How are you supposed to talk to a couple that reacts so indifferently to not at all to what you are saying? It is painfully obvious though that there is something wrong in this house as you can tell from every nuance of how they communicate that things are just not right.With the conviction that Lilith is in a bad environment and is at both mental and physical risk, she goes on a crusade with her boss to try to have the child removed from their custody. Emily fails in being able to accomplish it as they smooth talk their way out of any problems when talking to her boss. After this fails we see Emily show up at Lilith's school as she is clearly concerned, gives the girl her phone number, and asking her to call if anything is to ever happen.We flash forward to Edward and Margaret preparing to do something and Lilith calling Emily begging for help and claiming her parents are going to kill her. Lilith shows up with a police officer she is friends with and breaks in as they find the parents trying to roast the young girl alive in an oven. After a decently choreographed fight sequence we have the parents subdued and the daughter saved just in time.From this point everything appears to be going well for the main characters. The parents are in prison, Lilith is safe, and Emily is ready to move on to the next case - until Lilith tries to be adopted by her. When she succeeds all is going well until the people that matter in Emily's life start to commit suicide or be murdered. While the first two are a bit strange it's fairly obvious to Emily quickly that something is going on. Once she starts to put together the clues that Lilith is behind it - it may be too late.A lot of the plot felt forced and just did not work well at building up suspense. It really went for the quick thrill on each kill and didn't help to tie them in for a large build up. While the concept of how Lilith kills her victims through their greatest fears is a great concept - it was poorly executed.",3,After seeing this I kind of want to see more of Renee Zellweger in horror films,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,3039,"['Case', '39', 'was', 'directed', 'Christian', 'Alvart', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'released', 'Pandorum', 'written', 'Ray', 'Wright', 'who', 'just', 'released', 'Crazies', 'feel', 'mix', 'director', 'writer', 'actually', 'show', 'full', 'well', 'how', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'Christian', 'Alvart', 'put', 'together', 'very', 'solid', 'looking', 'movie', 'just', 'Pandorum', 'Ray', 'Wright', 'written', 'up', 'great', 'concept', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'put', 'feet', 'solidly', 'as', 'much', 'really', 'wanted', 'concept', 'film', 'only', 'complaint', 'Alvart', 'work', 'go', 'scares', 'building', 'up', 'suspense', 'plot', 'film', 'believe', 'was', 'mistake.This', 'story', 'Emily', 'Jenkins', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'social', 'worker', 'who', 'routine', 'trip', 'found', 'young', 'girl', 'Lilith', 'Jodelle', 'Ferland', 'be', 'being', 'abused', 'parents', 'Edward', 'Callum', 'Rennie', 'Margaret', 'Kerry', ""O'Malley"", 'have', 'admit', 'first', 'scene', 'meeting', 'couple', 'one', 'stronger', 'scenes', 'film', 'just', 'how', 'unsettling', 'was', 'How', 'are', 'supposed', 'talk', 'couple', 'so', 'indifferently', 'not', 'what', 'are', 'saying', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'something', 'wrong', 'house', 'can', 'tell', 'nuance', 'how', 'communicate', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'right.With', 'conviction', 'Lilith', 'bad', 'environment', 'mental', 'physical', 'risk', 'crusade', 'boss', 'try', 'have', 'child', 'removed', 'custody', 'Emily', 'being', 'able', 'accomplish', 'smooth', 'talk', 'way', 'problems', 'when', 'talking', 'boss', 'see', 'Emily', 'show', 'up', 'Lilith', 'school', 'clearly', 'concerned', 'girl', 'phone', 'number', 'asking', 'call', 'anything', 'ever', 'happen.We', 'flash', 'forward', 'Edward', 'Margaret', 'preparing', 'do', 'something', 'Lilith', 'calling', 'Emily', 'begging', 'help', 'claiming', 'parents', 'are', 'going', 'kill', 'Lilith', 'up', 'police', 'officer', 'friends', 'breaks', 'find', 'parents', 'trying', 'roast', 'young', 'girl', 'alive', 'oven', 'decently', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'sequence', 'have', 'parents', 'subdued', 'daughter', 'saved', 'just', 'time.From', 'point', 'everything', 'be', 'going', 'well', 'main', 'characters', 'parents', 'are', 'prison', 'Lilith', 'safe', 'Emily', 'ready', 'move', 'next', 'case', 'Lilith', 'tries', 'be', 'adopted', 'When', 'going', 'well', 'people', 'matter', 'Emily', 'life', 'start', 'commit', 'suicide', 'be', 'murdered', 'first', 'two', 'are', 'bit', 'strange', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'Emily', 'quickly', 'something', 'going', 'put', 'together', 'clues', 'Lilith', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'late.A', 'lot', 'plot', 'felt', 'forced', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'well', 'building', 'up', 'suspense', 'really', 'went', 'quick', 'thrill', 'kill', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'tie', 'large', 'build', 'up', 'concept', 'how', 'Lilith', 'victims', 'greatest', 'fears', 'great', 'concept', 'was', 'poorly', 'executed']",N/A

Rene plays a savvy case worker. She is overloaded with 38 cases when she is given case 39, about a 10 year old girl named Lilith a dead evil name give away. Rene ends up rescuing the girl from parents that are attempting to Hansel and Gretel her to death. Lilith stays with Rene (Emily) until she can get a foster home. While Rene is picking up stuff at the little girl's home she notices large dead bolts on the inside of her parent's door. At this point the plot is fairly well established and you can guess the rest of the film.The acting was superb. Jodelle Ferland was excellent, with the highlight being the scene with Rene's smug boyfriend. ""How did you answer number 12?"" Sweet.There were no great twists in the plot, not really a surprise ending. These were really needed to distinguish this movie from other demon kid movies. Overall I would go 4 1/2 stars on the strength of the performances and good dialouge. Not for parents with 10 year old girls who think they are possessed.",5,HER NAME WAS LILITH,1345420800,"08 20, 2012",2012,1086,"['do', ""n't"", 'read', 'box', 'will', 'still', 'know', 'entire', 'plot', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Rene', 'savvy', 'case', 'worker', 'overloaded', '38', 'cases', 'when', 'given', 'case', '39', '10', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'named', 'Lilith', 'dead', 'evil', 'name', 'give', 'away', 'Rene', 'up', 'rescuing', 'girl', 'parents', 'are', 'attempting', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'death', 'Lilith', 'Rene', 'Emily', 'can', 'get', 'foster', 'home', 'Rene', 'picking', 'up', 'stuff', 'little', 'girl', 'home', 'large', 'dead', 'bolts', 'inside', 'parent', 'door', 'point', 'plot', 'fairly', 'well', 'established', 'can', 'guess', 'rest', 'film.The', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'Jodelle', 'Ferland', 'was', 'excellent', 'highlight', 'being', 'scene', 'Rene', 'smug', 'boyfriend', 'How', 'did', 'answer', 'number', '12', 'Sweet.There', 'were', 'great', 'twists', 'plot', 'not', 'really', 'surprise', 'ending', 'were', 'really', 'needed', 'distinguish', 'movie', 'other', 'demon', 'kid', 'movies', 'Overall', 'would', 'go', '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'strength', 'performances', 'good', 'dialouge', 'Not', 'parents', '10', 'year', 'old', 'girls', 'who', 'think', 'are', 'possessed']",N/A
