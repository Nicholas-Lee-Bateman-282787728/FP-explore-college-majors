And the villagers strictly mind their own business as they gossip constantly about each other.As the series progresses, some key characters evolve and become more interesting. The romantic arc that spans the three seasons is quite moving, but be warned that along the way there are some tragedies.I'm not sure how I stumbled upon the series, but once I saw the first episode, I had to see them all. That still wasn't enough, so I picked up Ms. Beaton's DEATH OF A GOSSIP, her first Hamish novel. Yes, Hamish has redder hair and he's taller and lankier in the books, but the series enhanced the delight I'm experiencing as I read the books and find elements in them that were used here and there in the series.Shakespeare often took written works (fiction and history) and rearranged them to suit dramatized renderings. This series is intensely character driven, and the ""mysteries"" seem to exist merely so we can enjoy Hamish and his beloved townsfolk. It's his Zen-like, easy going way of dealing with life and death and the beauty of nature mixed with a razor sharp sense of humor that make him so magnetic to viewers and readers.Yes, the TV episodes mix up the novels' supporting characters and plots, but they play out well and are thoroughly enjoyable. Addictive, almost!I'm on book 5 now. I'll read more, and some day come back to enjoy Robert Carlyle bringing his take on Hamish to life again.Cheers!",4,"Great series, funny, entertaining, complements books!",1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,1524,"['series', 'fantastic', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'role', 'village', 'constable', 'who', 'when', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'villagers', 'strictly', 'mind', 'own', 'business', 'gossip', 'constantly', 'other.As', 'series', 'key', 'characters', 'evolve', 'become', 'more', 'interesting', 'romantic', 'arc', 'three', 'seasons', 'quite', 'moving', 'be', 'warned', 'way', 'are', 'tragedies.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'stumbled', 'series', 'once', 'saw', 'first', 'episode', 'had', 'see', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'picked', 'up', 'Ms.', 'Beaton', 'DEATH', 'A', 'GOSSIP', 'first', 'Hamish', 'novel', 'Yes', 'Hamish', 'redder', 'hair', 'taller', 'lankier', 'books', 'series', 'enhanced', 'delight', ""'m"", 'experiencing', 'read', 'books', 'find', 'elements', 'were', 'used', 'here', 'there', 'series.Shakespeare', 'often', 'took', 'written', 'works', 'fiction', 'history', 'rearranged', 'suit', 'dramatized', 'renderings', 'series', 'intensely', 'character', 'driven', 'mysteries', 'seem', 'exist', 'merely', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Hamish', 'beloved', 'townsfolk', 'Zen-like', 'easy', 'going', 'way', 'dealing', 'life', 'death', 'beauty', 'nature', 'mixed', 'razor', 'sharp', 'sense', 'humor', 'make', 'so', 'magnetic', 'viewers', 'readers.Yes', 'TV', 'episodes', 'mix', 'up', 'novels', 'supporting', 'characters', 'plots', 'play', 'out', 'well', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'Addictive', 'almost', ""'m"", 'book', '5', 'now', ""'ll"", 'read', 'more', 'day', 'come', 'back', 'enjoy', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'bringing', 'take', 'Hamish', 'life', 'again.Cheers']",N/A

This series and cast is so good that even the Westie terrier ""Wee Jock"" can't steal the show. The deft Robert Carlyle is one of the best actors out there, real and subtle, too excellent for Hollywood. Shirley Henderson of Harry Potter's ""Moaning Myrtle"" fame is always great, but so is all the talented cast. Billy Riddoch as Lachlan Sr. ""Daddy"" is a portly treat, and Stuart Davids as Lachie Jr. is superb. Davids would be a fantastic Doctor Who, capable of portraying every nuance of emotion, like David Tennant. Ralph Riach as the psychic T.V. John is pitch-perfect. Season Three features a cameo by the writer Daniel Boyle in his ""Deferred Sentence"" as the Handsome Sailor. This episode was beautifully filmed on the Isle of Skye, where Boyle's delightful Father McPhail says, ""Religion is irrational de facto, thus it should have some magic in it.""The main character is the northern Scottish landscape itself, spectacular, cloudy, rife with ghosts and legends, fog, bogs, peat, and single-malt whisky. Each story-line evolves, while Hamish MacBeth's personal and professional challenges make for a complex story. The Celtic imagination woven throughout is quite gratifying. You can't miss the last two episodes featuring the Stone of Destiny. We wish the ghosts of Scotland had graced the last scene as well, and that the series had continued for more seasons.

I purchased this set because among other things I am a fan of British mysteries and in particular of the village-rural genre.  I also own and am reading the Hamish McBeth series and enjoy each book enormously.  As all readers do, I visualize each character, their emotions, the physical setting and place.The TV series is somewhat of a disappointment to me.  On the positive side, the setting, the acting, the casting, filming, and most technical aspects of the production are well done.  But if your standard is authenticity to the author's written text and to the finer nuances of character motivation, the TV series is not as satisfying. The element of mystery is often missing.  The descriptor ""bad soap opera"" comes to mind in some of the episodes.  The producer and the screen writers often miss the mark.  I almost feel the TV series was written by persons who may be ignorant of and hold an animus to small town or rural life.  The books on the other hand positively portray and celebrate the unique characters that are part of non-urban places.Beaton's (Chesney's) Hamish is motivated by authentic justice and fairness.  If the ""criminal justice system"" fails,  Hamish often finds a means to ""adjust"" reality. In the Beaton's background, there are always elements of humor and ultimate justice.  The TV series sometimes closes off with a brutish tone leaving me with an underlying unease.Would I buy the DVDs if I had known of these variances with the literary version?

1086269,A2XK11WA3MHIG0,B000SINSYO,Richard Snouffer,"[10, 11]","I can't remember how I stumbled across this series, but am VERY glad that I did.  It is comedy; it is drama.  It is thoroughly enjoyable, having great humor, excellent characters and character development.A small town policeman Hamish Macbeth (Police Constable, or ""P.C. Macbeth"" in the Scottish vernacular) is set in a small Highland town of fierce loyalties.  As capable of bending a law as he is of enforcing it, Hamish is actually quite a sharp detective, but busily hides it because he ardently desires to avoid ANY notice from the higher ups.  Credit for his crime-solving abilities would mean unwanted attention.  That would eventually mean a transfer out of the BEAUTIFUL Highland community where he has become an essential part of the close-knit fabric of this small town.  The antics with which he manages to solve local crimes and do justice for his community--without garnering any credit--is an integral part of this series' humor, though plenty of comedy is also mined elsewhere throughout.Hamish is also a flawed character, making him seem much more real, more down to earth.  He is capable of deeply feeling guilt when his actions, though well intentioned, cause harm.  On the whole, his flaws make him much more likeable.  These flaws are not overdone, and certainly make him more realistic than the portrayal of an unflawed palladin would have done.  We get an intimate look at the eccentricities, integrity and honor of the title character throughout the series, and he measures up as a man of character and honor despite his flaws.I also loved the townsfolk.  This show, like the Canadian series, ""Corner Gas,"" exhibits wonderful local color that is characteristic of ANY small town, regardless of continent and culture.  In both of these series, despite having grown up on another continent or in another country--I KNOW and grew up with these people!I loved pretty much everything in ""Hamish Macbeth.""  I loved the Scottish accents and customs that come through in the Series.  I loved the humor and the characters.  I loved the strong loyalties of the characters for their town and for each other--especially the steadfast loyalty of Hamish's right-hand man.  Of keen interest through the series is a love triangle with a dramatic resolution and double climax.  I appreciated the character development, which was pretty good for a short-lived series of only 3 seasons.  (Perhaps the best compliment is that I DEARLY wish it could have been longer, but Robert Carlyle, the actor playing the title character, was clearly off to bigger and better things.)In fact, my ONLY criticisms are for what was left OUT of the DVD set.  There is no way to turn captions on from the DVD.  The Scottish accents are pretty thick to unaccustomed American ears, and those who have trouble hearing accents will miss large amounts of dialogue.  However, if your TV has a Closed Captioning setting, there ARE CC codes within the signal itself, so this defect can be gotten around by turning on Closed Captioning from your TV's settings.  My only MAJOR criticism though, is of the DISC SET and NOT of the series itself.  An episode, ""West Coast Story,"" which should have been Season 1, episode 4, was left out of the first season's discs. (What were they THINKING?!!)  I would normally have wanted to deduct about 1/2 a star for the CC difficulty and TWO stars for the missing episode but I couldn't bear to give it less than 4 stars because I enjoyed the series SO much.  The series itself would get a solid 5 stars from me.I heartily recommend this series.  As soon as I am able, I plan to dive into M.C. Beaton's books which inspired it.",4,A Prime Example Why American TV Should Stop Being SO Provincial,1315008000,"09 3, 2011",2011,3640,"['ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'how', 'stumbled', 'series', 'am', 'VERY', 'glad', 'did', 'comedy', 'drama', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'having', 'great', 'humor', 'excellent', 'characters', 'character', 'development.A', 'small', 'town', 'policeman', 'Hamish', 'Macbeth', 'Police', 'Constable', 'P.C', 'Macbeth', 'Scottish', 'vernacular', 'set', 'small', 'Highland', 'town', 'fierce', 'loyalties', 'capable', 'bending', 'law', 'enforcing', 'Hamish', 'actually', 'quite', 'sharp', 'detective', 'busily', 'ardently', 'avoid', 'ANY', 'notice', 'higher', 'ups', 'Credit', 'crime-solving', 'abilities', 'would', 'mean', 'unwanted', 'attention', 'would', 'eventually', 'mean', 'transfer', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'Highland', 'community', 'where', 'become', 'essential', 'part', 'close-knit', 'fabric', 'small', 'town', 'antics', 'solve', 'local', 'crimes', 'do', 'justice', 'community', 'garnering', 'credit', 'integral', 'part', 'series', 'humor', 'plenty', 'comedy', 'also', 'mined', 'elsewhere', 'throughout.Hamish', 'also', 'flawed', 'character', 'making', 'seem', 'much', 'more', 'real', 'more', 'down', 'earth', 'capable', 'deeply', 'feeling', 'guilt', 'when', 'actions', 'though', 'well', 'intentioned', 'cause', 'harm', 'whole', 'flaws', 'make', 'much', 'more', 'likeable', 'flaws', 'are', 'not', 'overdone', 'certainly', 'make', 'more', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'unflawed', 'palladin', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'get', 'intimate', 'look', 'eccentricities', 'integrity', 'honor', 'title', 'character', 'series', 'up', 'man', 'character', 'honor', 'flaws.I', 'also', 'loved', 'townsfolk', 'show', 'Canadian', 'series', 'Corner', 'Gas', 'wonderful', 'local', 'color', 'characteristic', 'ANY', 'small', 'town', 'regardless', 'continent', 'culture', 'series', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'continent', 'country', 'KNOW', 'grew', 'up', 'people', 'loved', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'Hamish', 'Macbeth', 'loved', 'Scottish', 'accents', 'customs', 'come', 'Series', 'loved', 'humor', 'characters', 'loved', 'strong', 'loyalties', 'characters', 'town', 'other', 'especially', 'steadfast', 'loyalty', 'Hamish', 'right-hand', 'man', 'keen', 'interest', 'series', 'love', 'triangle', 'dramatic', 'resolution', 'double', 'climax', 'appreciated', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'short-lived', 'series', 'only', '3', 'seasons', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'compliment', 'DEARLY', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'actor', 'playing', 'title', 'character', 'was', 'clearly', 'off', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'fact', 'ONLY', 'criticisms', 'are', 'what', 'was', 'left', 'OUT', 'DVD', 'set', 'way', 'turn', 'captions', 'DVD', 'Scottish', 'accents', 'are', 'pretty', 'thick', 'unaccustomed', 'American', 'ears', 'who', 'have', 'trouble', 'hearing', 'accents', 'will', 'miss', 'large', 'amounts', 'dialogue', 'However', 'TV', 'Closed', 'Captioning', 'setting', 'ARE', 'CC', 'codes', 'signal', 'so', 'defect', 'can', 'be', 'gotten', 'turning', 'Closed', 'Captioning', 'TV', 'settings', 'only', 'MAJOR', 'criticism', 'DISC', 'SET', 'NOT', 'series', 'episode', 'West', 'Coast', 'Story', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Season', '1', 'episode', '4', 'was', 'left', 'first', 'season', 'discs', 'What', 'were', 'THINKING', 'would', 'normally', 'have', 'wanted', 'deduct', '1/2', 'star', 'CC', 'difficulty', 'TWO', 'stars', 'missing', 'episode', 'could', ""n't"", 'bear', 'give', 'less', '4', 'stars', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'SO', 'much', 'series', 'would', 'get', 'solid', '5', 'stars', 'me.I', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'series', 'As', 'soon', 'am', 'able', 'plan', 'dive', 'M.C', 'Beaton', 'books', 'inspired']",N/A

1086274,A14Q5D3QYA8FPV,B000SINSYO,Shopper,"[4, 5]","I came across this series by accident, while watching a ""Monarch of the Glen"" DVD. I was intrigued enough not only to invest in the disks, but to read the books as well. I am pleased I did both. Marion Chesney, the Scottish born writer behind the M.C. Beaton pseudonym, has been delighting her readers with the highly addictive Hamish MacBeth mysteries since 1985. Hamish is the likable, but lazy and devoid of ambition bobby in the village of Lochdubh (pron: loch-doo). His keen mind and vast knowledge of local characters make him an effective crime fighter. However, he goes into much trouble hiding the fact from his superiors, in fear he'd be promoted out of the village he loves and considers his home. Whenever I recommend this series to someone, I am often asked these two questions:-How does the series compare to the books?Because of time restraints a series puts on a script, it is natural that some adjustments must be made. So, do not expect this to be a faithful adaptation. The huge advantage of the series is the generous inclusion of beautiful Scottish scenery. There is very little prose in the books that refers directly to nature, whereas in the series nature has been elevated almost to a status of a lead character. Smart (and satisfying to the viewer) move! You might find however, that a favourite human character of yours has been eliminated. But, there are a few delightful additions that I think adequately make up for the loss. The treatment of the character of Hamish MacBeth does pain me though. I find him not at all as likable in the series as he is in the books. For that reason alone, I give the series 3.5 stars.-How does the series compare to ""Midsomer Murders""?Well, for one, it takes place entirely in Scotland, rather then England. It is much more ""brow"", then ""high""; there are no fiscally wealthy characters here. However, when it comes to the wealth of their feelings for their village, Scotland, and one another, the eccentric Lochdubh bunch can give Midsomer inhabitants a run for their money. ""Hamish MacBeth"" is not only a mytery drama, but a romance as well. There is a lot of attention paid to the love lives of Hamish and the supporting characters. Last, but not least, the body count is decidedly lesser. Sometimes, there are no bodies at all and murders are prevented all together, or are solved before they happen (yep...).Whether you view the series as a stand alone work, or as a companion to the books, you are bound to appreciate the light entertainment value it provides!Enjoy!",4,"TV series vs books, vs Midsomer Murders",1256428800,"10 25, 2009",2009,2534,"['came', 'series', 'accident', 'watching', 'Monarch', 'Glen', 'DVD', 'was', 'intrigued', 'enough', 'not', 'only', 'invest', 'disks', 'read', 'books', 'well', 'am', 'pleased', 'did', 'Marion', 'Chesney', 'Scottish', 'born', 'writer', 'M.C', 'Beaton', 'pseudonym', 'been', 'delighting', 'readers', 'highly', 'addictive', 'Hamish', 'MacBeth', 'mysteries', '1985', 'likable', 'lazy', 'devoid', 'ambition', 'bobby', 'village', 'Lochdubh', 'pron', 'loch-doo', 'keen', 'mind', 'vast', 'knowledge', 'local', 'characters', 'make', 'effective', 'crime', 'fighter', 'However', 'much', 'trouble', 'hiding', 'fact', 'superiors', 'fear', ""'d"", 'be', 'promoted', 'village', 'home', 'Whenever', 'recommend', 'series', 'someone', 'am', 'often', 'asked', 'two', 'questions', '-How', 'series', 'compare', 'books', 'time', 'restraints', 'series', 'script', 'natural', 'adjustments', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'So', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'be', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'huge', 'advantage', 'series', 'generous', 'inclusion', 'beautiful', 'Scottish', 'scenery', 'very', 'little', 'prose', 'books', 'refers', 'directly', 'nature', 'whereas', 'series', 'nature', 'been', 'elevated', 'almost', 'status', 'lead', 'character', 'Smart', 'satisfying', 'viewer', 'move', 'might', 'find', 'however', 'favourite', 'human', 'character', 'yours', 'been', 'eliminated', 'are', 'few', 'delightful', 'additions', 'think', 'adequately', 'make', 'up', 'loss', 'treatment', 'character', 'Hamish', 'MacBeth', 'pain', 'find', 'not', 'all', 'likable', 'series', 'books', 'reason', 'alone', 'give', 'series', '3.5', 'stars.-How', 'series', 'compare', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'Well', 'one', 'place', 'entirely', 'Scotland', 'rather', 'then', 'England', 'much', 'more', 'brow', 'then', 'high', 'are', 'fiscally', 'wealthy', 'characters', 'here', 'However', 'when', 'wealth', 'feelings', 'village', 'Scotland', 'one', 'eccentric', 'Lochdubh', 'bunch', 'can', 'give', 'Midsomer', 'inhabitants', 'run', 'money', 'Hamish', 'MacBeth', 'not', 'only', 'mytery', 'drama', 'romance', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'attention', 'paid', 'love', 'Hamish', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'body', 'count', 'decidedly', 'lesser', 'Sometimes', 'are', 'bodies', 'murders', 'are', 'prevented', 'together', 'are', 'solved', 'happen', '.Whether', 'view', 'series', 'stand', 'alone', 'work', 'companion', 'books', 'are', 'bound', 'appreciate', 'light', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Enjoy']",N/A
