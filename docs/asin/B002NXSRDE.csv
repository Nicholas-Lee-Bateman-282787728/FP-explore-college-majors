1280368,A3G2MJPURQSCBD,B002NXSRDE,Big Miles Davis Fan,"[1, 1]","Last year I bought my first Madeleine Peyroux CD, ""Careless Love"". It's such a lovely recording that I eagerly searched for a concert by her on blu ray video. With non available I settled for ""Somethin' Grand"" on standard DVD.This concert by the French American artist was recorded in Los Angeles in 2009. It features four songs (""Dance me to the end"", ""Don't wait too long"", ""You're gonna make me lonesome"", and ""Between the bars"") from the CD. She is backed on stage by an excellent strings band.With a total of 17 songs this delightful concert is on the whole more folksy than the CD and worth owning. Audio and video are both excellent.",5,Something Worth Owning,1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,640,"['Last', 'year', 'bought', 'first', 'Madeleine', 'Peyroux', 'CD', 'Careless', 'Love', 'such', 'lovely', 'recording', 'eagerly', 'searched', 'concert', 'blu', 'ray', 'video', 'non', 'available', 'settled', 'Somethin', 'Grand', 'standard', 'DVD.This', 'concert', 'French', 'American', 'artist', 'was', 'recorded', 'Los', 'Angeles', '2009', 'four', 'songs', 'Dance', 'end', 'Do', ""n't"", 'wait', 'too', 'long', ""'re"", 'gon', 'make', 'lonesome', 'Between', 'bars', 'CD', 'backed', 'stage', 'excellent', 'strings', 'band.With', 'total', '17', 'songs', 'delightful', 'concert', 'whole', 'more', 'folksy', 'CD', 'worth', 'owning', 'Audio', 'video', 'are', 'excellent']",Madeleine Peyroux: Somethin' Grand
1280369,A2LIWKRUUH0CG7,B002NXSRDE,"Raffael Cordero ""Jared""","[0, 1]","Madeleine is such a great and unique artist that I would recommend her to anyone that likes music.  Upon hearing her voice and music for the first time, we immediately knew we had to have everything that she has ever done, and we did.  This is a little gem of a concert with amazing musicians in a very intimate setting.  This woman is so good that she does not need any fluff or gimmicks around her.  If you are looking for something grand, then look no further.",5,Something Grand Indeed,1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,463,"['Madeleine', 'such', 'great', 'unique', 'artist', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'music', 'hearing', 'voice', 'music', 'first', 'time', 'immediately', 'knew', 'had', 'have', 'everything', 'ever', 'done', 'did', 'little', 'gem', 'concert', 'amazing', 'musicians', 'very', 'intimate', 'setting', 'woman', 'so', 'good', 'not', 'need', 'fluff', 'gimmicks', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'grand', 'then', 'look', 'further']",Madeleine Peyroux: Somethin' Grand

Goodness, where would Ella Fitzgerald be today? Oh...she would be endorsing Jenny Craig and showing up on reality TV shows...instead of making hundreds of classic recordings.  But lets get back to this DVD...a wonderfully filmed show a bit over an hour is joined by a very interesting documentary and a sensationally revealing acoustic set!!! Great Artist and GREAT value for money.",5,wow...this musician/singer is so fresh/unique and wonderful!,1265414400,"02 6, 2010",2010,950,"['am', 'shocked', 'be', 'writing', 'first', 'review', '.I', 'stumbled', 'DVD', 'today', 'remembering', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'grabbed', 'Madeleine', 'sings', 'style', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'accompanies', 'small', 'bodied', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'playing', 'fingerstyle', 'very', 'well', 'find', 'phrasing', 'voice', 'so', 'unique', 'time', 'yet', 'totally', 'fresh.I', 'would', 'imagine', 'Madeleine', 'were', 'bit', 'more', 'photogenic', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'first', 'reviewer', ""'d"", 'be', 'much', 'more', 'popular', 'sad', 'state', 'current', 'society', 'Goodness', 'where', 'would', 'Ella', 'Fitzgerald', 'be', 'today', 'Oh', 'would', 'be', 'endorsing', 'Jenny', 'Craig', 'showing', 'up', 'reality', 'TV', 'shows', 'instead', 'making', 'hundreds', 'classic', 'recordings', 'get', 'back', 'DVD', 'wonderfully', 'filmed', 'show', 'bit', 'hour', 'joined', 'very', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'sensationally', 'revealing', 'acoustic', 'set', 'Great', 'Artist', 'GREAT', 'value', 'money']",Madeleine Peyroux: Somethin' Grand

Billie holiday s voice, and step away Diana Krall were some comments. I think some people got excited too quick.Is she good yes but no more her voice really is average she never sings a high note always pretty much on the same tone. BUT when she sang in French Wow the voice changed completly and that was nice.Unfortunately two songs only.The musicians with her are excellent I especially like the organ  + the piano.Loved the instrumental of the songs better than with vocals sometimes.  Good show but not as fantastic as described by others. For fans only maybe or with average expectation you will enjoy but please stop the comparison with others.",3,Something not so Grand,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,726,"['reading', 'previous', 'reviews', 'was', 'really', 'expecting', 'Something', 'Grand', 'Billie', 'holiday', 's', 'voice', 'step', 'away', 'Diana', 'Krall', 'were', 'comments', 'think', 'people', 'got', 'excited', 'too', 'quick.Is', 'good', 'yes', 'more', 'voice', 'really', 'average', 'never', 'high', 'note', 'always', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'tone', 'BUT', 'when', 'sang', 'French', 'Wow', 'voice', 'changed', 'completly', 'was', 'nice.Unfortunately', 'two', 'songs', 'only.The', 'musicians', 'are', 'excellent', 'especially', 'organ', 'piano.Loved', 'instrumental', 'songs', 'better', 'vocals', 'sometimes', 'Good', 'show', 'not', 'as', 'fantastic', 'described', 'others', 'fans', 'only', 'maybe', 'average', 'expectation', 'will', 'enjoy', 'please', 'stop', 'comparison', 'others']",Madeleine Peyroux: Somethin' Grand
1280372,A1DSOF0EK9G06C,B002NXSRDE,Zarathustra,"[12, 13]","This DVD really is something grand. It features a concert in a Los Angeles club and includes five videos of acoustic songs and a documentary.Madeleine Peyroux was born in Athens Georgia in 1974. At the age of 13 she moved to Paris and became a street singer. In her first solo album Dreamland, released in 1997 with a cover of Edith Piaf's signature song La Vie en Rose and Patsy Cline's Walkin' After Midnight, she sounds like the reincarnation of Billie Holiday. Her next album Careless Love (2004) opens with a cover of Leonard Cohen's  Dance Me To The End of Love and includes Josephine Baker's J'ai Deux Amours and Bob Dylan's You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You're Gone. In 2006 Half the Perfect World was released with more covers, followed by Bare Bones in 2009, which includes some of her own compositions.Peyroux is the most talented jazz singer to appear in many years. I would love to see as her next offering a Live in Paris DVD/CD combo with mostly French songs, unlike Diana Krall's all English concert in Paris.",5,Watch Out Diana Krall,1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,1030,"['DVD', 'really', 'something', 'grand', 'concert', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'club', 'five', 'videos', 'acoustic', 'songs', 'documentary.Madeleine', 'Peyroux', 'was', 'born', 'Athens', 'Georgia', '1974', 'age', '13', 'moved', 'Paris', 'became', 'street', 'singer', 'first', 'solo', 'album', 'Dreamland', 'released', '1997', 'cover', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'signature', 'song', 'La', 'Vie', 'en', 'Rose', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'Walkin', 'Midnight', 'reincarnation', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'next', 'album', 'Careless', 'Love', '2004', 'cover', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', 'Dance', 'Me', 'End', 'Love', 'Josephine', 'Baker', ""J'ai"", 'Deux', 'Amours', 'Bob', 'Dylan', ""'re"", 'Gon', 'Make', 'Me', 'Lonesome', 'When', ""'re"", 'Gone', '2006', 'Perfect', 'World', 'was', 'released', 'more', 'covers', 'followed', 'Bare', 'Bones', '2009', 'own', 'compositions.Peyroux', 'most', 'talented', 'jazz', 'singer', 'appear', 'many', 'years', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'next', 'offering', 'Live', 'Paris', 'DVD/CD', 'combo', 'mostly', 'French', 'songs', 'Diana', 'Krall', 'English', 'concert', 'Paris']",Madeleine Peyroux: Somethin' Grand
