The only thing I truly hated about this disc set is Warner Brothers' infuriating ""half-assed"" keepcases!

But ""Under the [Red] Hood"" almost does the character justice!Having long since moved away from being a comics collector, I was unfamiliar with the original story this feature is based on (with the exception of the death of Jason Todd, which I was still around for), but this entry is powerful enough all the same!Despite how much I'd really like to move ""Superman & Batman: Apocalypse"" ahead to the #2 spot, in light of the action & moving drama of ""Red Hood,"" I just can't bring myself to justifiably do it.Though the wrap-up for this one could've (and should've) been a lot better... and ""Amazo""???? (WTH? -- a whole who's who of baddies DC could've pulled up for the occasion, and they gave us ""Amazo""?) -- even so, I'm still placing this DCU feature right near the front of the line, just below the dynamite 5-star performance ""Wonder Woman"" feature.

1338164,A3TK2IOP8UQ087,B003ES5JDS,"Alabaster Jones ""perpenhopher""","[1, 1]","You should read A Death in the Family, then you should read The Killing Joke, and then you should watch this movie.This is incredibly faithful to the spirit of the comics.I grew up with Batman in the 80s and early 90s.  I was there when Jason Todd was an overzealous child, and I was there when he was murdered by the Joker.  I was there when Batman nearly lost his sht and beat the Joker to within an inch of his life because of it.  I had, however, tuned out by the time that DC decided to bring Jason back from the dead as this familiar anti-hero, although I knew that it had happened.After the New 52 reboot, I started reading the new Red Hood series and liked it enough to check out this movie, which more than exceeded my expectations of what it would be.  As I said, I'm unaware of how the comics handled this bit of story, but I felt that this movie handled the drama that I imagined much better than I imagined.My only complaint is that Nightwing's appearance seems kind of wasted in the story.  He's basically here just to complain and emphasize Batman's 'loner' philosophy.  Even that works, though, because it lets the viewer feel the coldness that all of the Robins have felt from Batman.  Even though I would have loved to see more of Nightwing, the way he is treated does serve to show how Batman's former trusted confidant could feel such animosity towards him.This is a great animated feature, but I definitely feel like old-school comic readers will get more out of it than most.",5,One of the best Batman movies you can buy.

So I had no preconceived notions, now don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Batman fan, but I've never really been into the comics, i got hooked by the Tim Burton Batman from the late 80s.  So I like Batman when its fairly dark, and or serious, and this film is both. I did look up the Jason Todd story after I saw this, and I'm VERY glad they dropped the Superboy angle, that was just too awkward to swallow.  As for this movie, I loved it, the animation and music were great.  I wasn't too keen on John DiMaggio voicing Joker initially, but he grew on me.  His laugh was creepy! Bruce Greenwood had some serious shoes to fill as I'm a huge Kevin Conroy fan, I grew up watching Batman:TAS. But i think Mr. Greenwood did a great job, and i would be happy to hear him voice Batman again. Overall i think this is one of the best animated Batman films out there thus far.

1338168,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B003ES5JDS,Armando N. Roman,"[2, 4]","I'm not much of a superhero comic reader, and I'm not all -that- familiar with Batman. I've seen a few of the movies, learned a bit about him from friends of mine and from podcasts that talk about comics, and I was only a casual watcher of The Animated Series when it debuted in the early 90s. I keep meaning to read Frank Miller's stuff on Batman though, and I've had the Arkham games on my wishlist for a while. Under the Red Hood is a movie I've been meaning to see for a long time, ever since it first came out actually. Reviews for it were praising this as the best Batman-anything, calling it a dark film, accessible to anyone, even if they aren't versed in the world of Gotham City. I finally watched it last night, and from the opening sequence between the Joker and Robin, I kept feeling like I was watching a handful of episodes of The Animated Series, minus the great voice acting from Conroy and Hamill, and some of the suspense. It's tough to say if people just have low standards when it comes to animation these days, or if it's blind fanboyism that's doing the raving.We start out with Batman racing to find Robin, who's been captured by the Joker. The Joker's got Robin tied up, and relentlessly beats him across the face with a crowbar, having fun like he usually does. Eventually, the Joker leaves, and before Batman can even get in the building to save Robin, BLAM! It explodes and the Boy Wonder is no more. Cut to 5 years later and the Joker is now locked up at Arkham Asylum, while Black Mask tries to control Gotham City. Unfortunately for him, a new guy's in town- Red Hood. He rules over all the other criminals through fear, and acting on his promises of killing anyone without a second's warning if they act up. Heck, even if they DON'T act up, he'll take them out. Red Hood is cleaning up Gotham City while still not doing the 'right' thing. Batman learns of this new foe after dispatching an advanced robot that was part of a shipment to Black Mask. As the days go by, Batman puts the pieces together regarding Red Hood's identity, while still being troubled by the loss of his sidekick. Meanwhile, Black Mask is getting fed up with Red Hood interfering with his plans, realizing that he's always one step behind. And so he decides to make a deal with someone legitimately insane who shouldn't have any problems with the situation.At about an hour and 15 minutes long, Under the Red Hood never drags on. It moves at a brisk pace, with very few scenes without a fight or important dialogue. I even kept waiting for the obligatory ""my parents are dead!"" scene, and fortunately got no such thing! This movie is full of action and detective work, and most Batman fans are very pleased with the end result. There's not a huge cast of characters, so enough time is spent with everyone, from Black Mask to Nightwing to the Joker. We even get some good scenes with young Robin when Batman is having flashbacks of the beginning of his sidekick's career. Scenes like this are done well, and tastefully. They're not just put there to make you feel sorry for Robin or Batman, and serve their purpose. Animation-wise, Under the Red Hood looks very good for the most part, though some CG animated objects are a bit of an eyesore. I'm not one of those anti-CG nuts who rolls their eyes whenever they see it, or hear about a new CG movie, but what's used here doesn't look very good, and I can't help but wonder how much harder it would have been to just animate it like everything else.So it's a pretty good movie in the plot, action and animation categories, so what's the problem? For me, there were two big problems. The first being the voice for the Joker and the other being that they were tame when it came to the violence. I'll get that second problem out of the way first here with a good example. In the beginning when the Joker is just wasting Robin with the crowbar, it doesn't seem like it hurts that much. There's no blood, no bruises, not even cringe-inducing sound effects to really send the message home. It seems like Robin's being hit with something much less deadly, like a plastic bat. There's another very good scene later on involving a certain someone's ""interview"" with Black Mask, where an object is used to cut the throat of someone. -As soon- as the glass swipes past the neck, the dude's hands are up, like he's choking, and again, there's no blood. Look, I'm not a gore hound (in fact, I get bored with how violent things like God of War are these days), but is there something wrong with adding some blood to make things a bit more real and serious here? The whole movie has the 'old western death' syndrome, where people would get shot and fall over, and that'd be the end of it.Regarding the Joker's voice, I can't say anything bad about John Dimaggio, as he does seem to be trying to give a new take on the character. At the same time, it just doesn't sound right to me. He's too serious, and sounds like he's smoked a few more packs than he should. For this reason, I didn't like the Joker's scenes as much as I would have if say, Mark Hamill had been brought back to do the role. The entire movie, I just kept imagining how much more fun his Joker would have been here. Listening to the performance he gives, it sounds like Dimaggio was going for a mix between the Hamill and Ledger Jokers.In the end, Under the Red Hood didn't impress me. It's a fun romp through Gotham City for me, someone who hasn't been there in a while, but could still be seen as maybe a three-part episode of a newer Batman animated series. Three stars isn't a bad rating at all. Though I'm sure plenty of fans are going to say otherwise with a healthy dose of 'No' votes for this review.",3,An entertaining entry in the animated Batman world.,1366588800,"04 22,

1338169,A26FPHC71C5IX3,B003ES5JDS,Aryael de Kaprii,"[0, 0]","This was pretty good, I get nervous around Batman Animated Films. Batman alone is a little... well...Boring. I need Superman and the Justice League to add some spice.  This was spicy, I loved it. The Red Hood was kick'N ass and take'N names. And WOW talk about a twist. I adore the Joker, he cracks me up. Of all the villains in both the DC and Marvel Universe he is my favorite. He always has the best lines.  So anyway, this movie is about Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder (Jason). N-E Way, Joker got his hands on the boy (well by now he is a young man) and is going to town on him with a crowbar. Batmans comes to save the day (the question is: does he?) 5 years later this dude in a red motorcycle helmet (not really but kind of) shows up and bitch-slaps all the crime lords of Gotham. But he is not cleaning up crime, he is making them work for him. This is all part of an elaborate plot.  This movie really shows a softer side to Batman -I know I know, do we really want to see a ""soft side"" to the caped crusader? Yesterday I would have said HELL NO, but this soft side I liked.

I was in heaven!!The casting in this movie was spectacular for the most part! Jensen did a tremendous job voicing Jason Todd and Neil Patrick Harris most certainly owns Night wing as far as I'm concerned!!I am a big fan of Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy, so its hard picturing anyone else doing their voices.

I still always love Mark Hamill the most, but I was really impressed with John Dimaggio as well!!The animation was also perfect!! It suited the tone of the story!!

1338176,AVIG0TFY9CDPD,B003ES5JDS,"Baton Rouge Brent ""Purplehound!""","[89, 100]","I was prepared to dislike the new DC direct-to-dvd animated film, Batman: Under the Red Hood.  I've been annoyed with these animated films for a number of reasons, some admittedly nitpicky and petty, but annoyances just the same.  However, after watching a review copy I was quite pleased with the way it worked out!  Having read the original story arc in the comics, I wondered how they were going to take such a complex tale, one that draws on various Batman stories going as far back as 1951, and roll it all up into a neat little self-contained package lasting under an hour and 20 minutes (short running time--another gripe of mine).  The answer is, quite deftly!The story has to do with the Batman's greatest failure, the sadistic, violent death of the second Robin, Jason Todd, at the hands of the Joker, who began his career as a masked criminal known as the Red Hood, which is established in short, succinct flashbacks.  The story begins five years after the death of Jason Todd and involves a criminal turf war between the Black Mask, an aggressive and entrepreneurial mob boss who wears a black skull mask, and a new masked criminal--a new Red Hood.  This new Red Hood is trying to clean up Gotham by controlling the gangs, and his methods are violent, ruthless, and murderous, and thus he comes to the attention of the Batman.  A showdown is inevitable, but who's manipulating who, how will the Black Mask react, and what role does the volatile Joker play in the plan?The story is action-packed, very dark, and should make casual viewers and fans quite happy.  Some gripes; Bruce Greenwood and John DiMaggio turn in terrific jobs as the Batman and the Joker, respectively, but I really wish they would have gotten Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill to play the parts.  Those two actors are so well associated with the roles and it would have been quite interesting to see how they would have handled such a dark and violent story.  Sometimes the violence is kept to a nil when it should be amped up.  For example, the death of Jason Todd is fairly unbelievable; the Joker spends a good deal of time beating him with a crowbar, yet afterwards he looks only as though he fell down and scraped himself up a little.  The comic book story, A Death In the Family, regulated by the Comics Code Authority no less, showed blood, bruising, swelling, a shredded costume, and made him look more than half dead.  The movie fails to convey this, and when they're dealing with a PG-13 rating they could certainly have done better.Another big problem I have with this film, and the DC direct-to-dvd movies in general, is the short running time.  Again, with a PG-13 rating and such dark and complex stories, it's more than obvious that the intended audience is NOT young children and pre-teens, but rather an older, more mature audience.  So why the short running times geared towards the short attention spans of young children?!  This film runs one hour and 15 minutes.  The last film, Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, ran only one hour and 13 minutes.  Please, DC, PLEASE--know your audience and realize that the vast majority of people purchasing these films are adults who can keep track of sophisticated plots, complex character development, and running times that are closer to those of adult movies--an hour and a half to two hours!  If you did that, you could do so much more with these animated films.Depsite my gripes, I have to give this movie four out of five stars.  It was very entertaining, with lots of action and some seriously twisted moments from both the Joker and the Black Mask.  Parents, please take note from a fellow parent:  just because this is an animated film, that does not mean it is suitable for young children.  Please take the PG-13 rating seriously.",4,"Dark, violent, and action packed!!!",1278892800,"07 12, 2010",2010,3780,"['was', 'prepared', 'dislike', 'new', 'DC', 'direct-to-dvd', 'animated', 'film', 'Batman', 'Red', 'Hood', ""'ve"", 'been', 'annoyed', 'animated', 'films', 'number', 'reasons', 'admittedly', 'nitpicky', 'petty', 'just', 'same', 'However', 'watching', 'review', 'copy', 'was', 'quite', 'pleased', 'way', 'worked', 'out', 'Having', 'read', 'original', 'story', 'arc', 'comics', 'wondered', 'how', 'were', 'going', 'take', 'such', 'complex', 'tale', 'one', 'various', 'Batman', 'going', 'far', 'back', '1951', 'roll', 'up', 'neat', 'little', 'self-contained', 'package', 'lasting', 'hour', '20', 'minutes', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'gripe', 'mine', 'answer', 'quite', 'deftly', 'story', 'do', 'Batman', 'greatest', 'failure', 'sadistic', 'violent', 'death', 'second', 'Robin', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'hands', 'Joker', 'who', 'began', 'career', 'masked', 'criminal', 'known', 'Red', 'Hood', 'established', 'short', 'succinct', 'flashbacks', 'story', 'five', 'years', 'death', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'criminal', 'turf', 'war', 'Black', 'Mask', 'aggressive', 'entrepreneurial', 'mob', 'boss', 'who', 'black', 'skull', 'mask', 'new', 'masked', 'criminal', 'new', 'Red', 'Hood', 'new', 'Red', 'Hood', 'trying', 'clean', 'up', 'Gotham', 'controlling', 'gangs', 'methods', 'are', 'violent', 'ruthless', 'murderous', 'thus', 'attention', 'Batman', 'showdown', 'inevitable', 'who', 'manipulating', 'who', 'how', 'will', 'Black', 'Mask', 'react', 'what', 'role', 'volatile', 'Joker', 'play', 'plan', 'story', 'action-packed', 'very', 'dark', 'should', 'make', 'casual', 'viewers', 'fans', 'quite', 'happy', 'gripes', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'John', 'DiMaggio', 'turn', 'terrific', 'jobs', 'Batman', 'Joker', 'respectively', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'Kevin', 'Conroy', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'play', 'parts', 'two', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'associated', 'roles', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'handled', 'dark', 'violent', 'story', 'violence', 'kept', 'nil', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'amped', 'up', 'example', 'death', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'fairly', 'unbelievable', 'Joker', 'good', 'deal', 'time', 'beating', 'crowbar', 'yet', 'only', 'as', 'fell', 'down', 'scraped', 'up', 'little', 'comic', 'book', 'story', 'Death', 'Family', 'regulated', 'Comics', 'Code', 'Authority', 'no', 'less', 'showed', 'blood', 'bruising', 'swelling', 'shredded', 'costume', 'made', 'look', 'more', 'half', 'dead', 'movie', 'convey', 'when', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'could', 'certainly', 'have', 'done', 'better.Another', 'big', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'DC', 'direct-to-dvd', 'movies', 'general', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'Again', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'such', 'dark', 'complex', 'stories', 'more', 'obvious', 'intended', 'audience', 'NOT', 'young', 'children', 'pre-teens', 'rather', 'older', 'more', 'mature', 'audience', 'So', 'why', 'short', 'running', 'times', 'geared', 'short', 'attention', 'spans', 'young', 'children', 'film', 'one', 'hour', '15', 'minutes', 'last', 'film', 'Justice', 'League', 'Crisis', 'Two', 'Earths', 'ran', 'only', 'one', 'hour', '13', 'minutes', 'Please', 'DC', 'PLEASE', 'know', 'audience', 'realize', 'vast', 'majority', 'people', 'purchasing', 'films', 'are', 'adults', 'who', 'can', 'keep', 'track', 'sophisticated', 'plots', 'complex', 'character', 'development', 'running', 'times', 'are', 'closer', 'adult', 'movies', 'hour', 'half', 'two', 'hours', 'did', 'could', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'animated', 'films.Depsite', 'gripes', 'have', 'give', 'movie', 'four', 'five', 'stars', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'lots', 'action', 'seriously', 'twisted', 'moments', 'Joker', 'Black', 'Mask', 'Parents', 'please', 'take', 'note', 'fellow', 'parent', 'just', 'animated', 'film', 'not', 'mean', 'suitable', 'young', 'children', 'Please', 'take', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'seriously']",Batman: Under the Red Hood
1338177,A11PRT1CCVHB52,B003ES5JDS,"B. Daniel ""ComicBOOK Lover""","[0, 0]","So I finally got myself a PS3 and have moved into the world of Blu-ray...sort of. I still need a nice HD TV, but that's coming. So this won't be a review of how the Blu-ray quality of the picture held up, though even on the screen I watched it on it was absolutely beautiful. My friend just kept repeating ""the animation is sick!"" So yeah even without the TV it was gorgeous. Oh and the sound was great too, my other friend that was there was stunned right away by the clarity of sound. So that was cool too. And now that I've gotten that out of the way on to what you really came here to find out, was it any good?The answer is a resounding HELLYEAH!!!! I have been a fan of all of the DC Animated films, and this is by far the best in my opinion. Though they started off a little wobbly they have matured into some truly fun and well done films. I still say they should be at least 15 minutes longer each but they have started to make up for that a little with the DC Showcase shorts, but more on that in a bit.First Some quick background for the uninformed aka non-geeks. Everyone knows who Batman is. Most know who Robin is as well. A lot may not know however that there have been several Robins, three that are well known and loved or hated as it were. Dick Grayson was the first Robin, and grew into his own heroic mantle as Nightwing (recently taking on the mantle of the bat himself), while Jason Todd was the second Robin who was headstrong and less loved. Then there was Tim Drake, the third and arguably the best Robin, as he took the title from being just a sidekick to being his own solo hero, as well as following in Dick's footsteps and leading the Teen Titans.  Still with me? Good. Now in 1988 Jason Todd had become unloved by fans to the point where DC allowed fans to vote on the fate of Todd at the end of the ""A Death in The Family"" story arc. Fans voted him dead. And that's exactly where this movie starts, with the death of Jason Todd at the hands (or crowbar and bomb) of the Joker. Judd Winnick who wrote the ""Under The Hood"" arc that this film is based on struck gold with this. He not only faithfully adapted the story but improved it by streamlining it of all the crazy subplots and the ""Crisis"" event tie-in. And what a story it is!!! It's gripping, emotional, and action packed. I mean seriously ACTION PACKED! There's barely a lull in the film before you're off to the next chase or fight. The choreography for the fights is amazing too. But it's the story that propels these insane action scenes and it just keeps getting better as the film progresses.Five years after the death of Robin, there's a new vigilante taking on the criminal element in Gotham called the Red Hood. He's using the name of the Joker's first criminal identity and taking on all the crime lords in the city especially Black Mask, and he isn't afraid to shed a little, or a lot of blood. This naturally catches Batman's attention, and the chase is on. I really don't want to say too much more about the plot as if you're not a comic person, the person under the hood as it were is still a mystery, though not much of one due to obvious clues but still, it's a mystery all the same.The animation is slick and very well done. The Batman model looks like an updated version of the one seen in DC's last release ""Justice League: Crisis on two Earths,"" and is well detailed as are all the other characters. Kudos to DC for finally using Nightwing's comic uniform instead of the silly bird insignia they have been using (though the ""Teen Titans"" and ""The Batman"" versions were cool), and for crafting a Joker who truly looks sinister. And we can't talk about an animated flick without mentioning the voice cast. Wow! That's all I have to say. First of all Bruce Greenwood voicing Batman was rather good. I am one of the few that have been okay with most of the iterations of the character as I though each voice fit with that version of the character, but for this dark and brooding story and world, I felt that Greenwood captured it perfectly. Kevin Conroy who has voiced Bats for almost 20 years in animation is the iconic voice, and he would've been great, but Greenwood did an exceptional job. Neil Patrick Harris was spot on as Nightwing, he got his chatty personality but his detective upbringing down very well. Wade Williams was interesting as Black Mask. The character first appeared in animated form on ""The Batman"" voiced by James Remar and was cold, and calculating, never really losing his cool. This version is very cold when calm, but violently over the top when he's angered and I liked it. But the voice I loved most was John Dimagio as The Joker. You know DiMagio as Bender from ""Futurama,"" and here he's absolutely fantastic. A bit more deep voiced and gravely than I was used to, his humor is dry and he's constantly cracking himself up. But that dry delivery is amplified by the psychotic and sadistic things he says. Just wait til you see the final confrontation between Batman, Joker, and Red Hood.This movie was amazing, but the total package is made better by the DC Showcase short ""Jonah Hex."" Thomas Jane (who wanted to play the part in the live-action film) voices Hex and he is awesome. Just like the last Showcase short ""The Spectre,"" Hex completely embodies the genre it attempts to capture. It is 100% a western in the vein of ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" and other Eastwood classics. From the setting to the music it has a true western feel, and none of the cheesiness that was in the live-action film. This is what the film should have been. Rounding out the voice cast are Michael Rooker, Linda Hamilton and Michelle Trachtenberg. Other special features included are two documentaries about the two Robins featured in the film, Dick Grayson and Jason Todd. There's a first look at the upcoming ""Superman/Batman: Apocalypse"" based on the ""Supergirl From Krypton"" arc, some trailers, and of course Bruce Timm's picks from past cartoon series, this time all from ""Batman: The Animated series,"" with a personal favorite of mine being ""Robin's Reckoning"" telling Dick Grayson's origin. Don't look for any updated picture quality with these though. They're just as they are on the DVD.All in all a good buy for anyone who is a fan of Batman or of just good action.",5,A Truly Dark Knight!!,1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,6288,"['So', 'finally',

Combining the tragedy of the loss of a Robin (Jason Todd) at the hands of a homocidal Joker, the pain of Batman in failing to prevent the murder, the emergence of a major new force in the Gotham underworld, and the unpredictable impact and moral code of nearly-immortal Ra's al Ghul, the surprisingly short feature melds all these elements into a literate, well-crafted and exciting 'whole'.The voice talents are superb, although, as a long-time Batman fan, I'd have loved hearing Kevin Conroy voice the Caped Crusader, in this production. Neil Patrick Harris makes a very credible adult Dick Grayson/Nightwing (Harris is making quite a career voicing young DC heroes...I loved him as Flash inJustice League - The New Frontier (Two-Disc Special Edition), as well!) Jensen Ackles is equally good as the youthful Red Hood, as is Jason Isaacs' portrayal of Ghul. Truthfully, I felt John DiMaggio's Joker lacked the edge of Mark Hamill's interpretation, but I'm partial to Hamill's portrayal, and you can judge for yourself...The artwork is simply incredible; just pop in a Warner/DC-produced DVD from a few years back, and you will be amazed at how much the definition, line-quality, and overall appearance has improved! This is certainly movie screen-caliber stuff.I always love Bruce Timm's 'picks' as additional features, from over a decade of animated Batman TV episodes; they touch upon the themes of the feature, offering an earlier 'take', geared to the younger TV demographic. Fascinating stuff! The history of Robin feature is fun, too, if a bit superficial. I wasn't as thrilled by the Jonah Hex short, which didn't fit in with the rest of the material, and clearly served as a plug to the live-action film (which bombed, sorry, guys!)...but overall, the DVD is top-notch.Great work, DC!",5,"Gritty, Beautifully-Rendered New Classic...",1288915200,"11 5, 2010",2010,2081,"['Batman', 'Red', 'Hood', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'combining', 'best-selling', 'graphic', 'novels', 'Batman', 'Death', 'Family', 'DC', 'Comics', 'Classic', 'Library', 'andBatman', 'Hood', 'Vol', '1andBatman', 'Hood', 'Vol', '2', 'arguably', 'best-ever', 'direct-to-DVD', 'animated', 'DC', 'feature', 'Combining', 'tragedy', 'loss', 'Robin', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'hands', 'homocidal', 'Joker', 'pain', 'Batman', 'failing', 'prevent', 'murder', 'emergence', 'major', 'new', 'force', 'Gotham', 'underworld', 'unpredictable', 'impact', 'moral', 'code', 'nearly-immortal', 'Ra', 'al', 'Ghul', 'surprisingly', 'short', 'feature', 'elements', 'literate', 'well-crafted', 'exciting', ""'whole'.The"", 'voice', 'talents', 'are', 'superb', 'long-time', 'Batman', 'fan', ""'d"", 'have', 'loved', 'hearing', 'Kevin', 'Conroy', 'voice', 'Caped', 'Crusader', 'production', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'very', 'credible', 'adult', 'Dick', 'Grayson/Nightwing', 'Harris', 'making', 'quite', 'career', 'voicing', 'young', 'DC', 'heroes', 'loved', 'Flash', 'inJustice', 'League', 'New', 'Frontier', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'as', 'well', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'equally', 'good', 'youthful', 'Red', 'Hood', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'portrayal', 'Ghul', 'Truthfully', 'felt', 'John', 'DiMaggio', 'Joker', 'lacked', 'edge', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'interpretation', ""'m"", 'partial', 'Hamill', 'portrayal', 'can', 'judge', 'artwork', 'simply', 'incredible', 'just', 'pop', 'Warner/DC-produced', 'DVD', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'will', 'be', 'amazed', 'how', 'much', 'definition', 'line-quality', 'overall', 'appearance', 'improved', 'certainly', 'movie', 'screen-caliber', 'stuff.I', 'always', 'love', 'Bruce', 'Timm', ""'picks"", 'additional', 'features', 'decade', 'animated', 'Batman', 'TV', 'episodes', 'touch', 'themes', 'feature', 'offering', 'earlier', ""'take"", 'geared', 'younger', 'TV', 'demographic', 'Fascinating', 'stuff', 'history', 'Robin', 'feature', 'fun', 'too', 'bit', 'superficial', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'thrilled', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'short', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'rest', 'material', 'clearly', 'served', 'plug', 'live-action', 'film', 'bombed', 'sorry', 'guys', 'overall', 'DVD', 'top-notch.Great', 'work', 'DC']",Batman: Under the Red Hood

That being said---I can honestly say I got my money's worth with Batman: Under the Red Hood. This animated feature, to me, is the animated equivalent of The Dark Knight. It's gritty, dark, action-packed and has alot of atmosphere.The story, itself, deals with the death of Jason Todd(the second Robin) at the hands of The Joker. The Joker, as you find out in the feature, started out his criminal career as The Red Hood, which you find out in flashbacks. Fast Forward sometime to Gotham City, there's a turf war going on between The Black Mask and a new criminal named The Red Hood. The Red Hood, you see, is trying to clean up Gotham by controlling criminal activity on the streets(like The Black Mask) but his methods aren't respectable, to say the least. That comes to the attention of The Batman, who quickly figures out who The Red Hood is and why he is doing things the way that he is. Without giving too much away, let's just say things are rather complex in this tale.I was especially impressed by the voice talents of Bruce Greenwood, John DiMaggio, Neil Patrick Harris, Jensen Ackles, Jason Isaacs, and Wade Williams. They made this feature quite believable. I disagree with others about Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill's missing their respective roles this time. I don't know if they could've pulled off quite as believable a story.At any rate, I loved the animated feature and I look forward to Warner Premier and DC's next project.",5,Batman: Under the Red Hood........,1284163200,"09 11, 2010",2010,1673,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'lie', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'collecting', 'Batman', 'animated', 'features', 'can', 'especially', 'DC', 'Universe', 'ones', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'felt', 'last', 'one', ""'d"", 'purchased', 'was', 'worth', 'money', 'paid', 'being', 'said', '-I', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'got', 'money', 'worth', 'Batman', 'Red', 'Hood', 'animated', 'feature', 'animated', 'equivalent', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'gritty', 'dark', 'action-packed', 'alot', 'atmosphere.The', 'story', 'deals', 'death', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'second', 'Robin', 'hands', 'Joker', 'Joker', 'find', 'out', 'feature', 'started', 'out', 'criminal', 'career', 'Red', 'Hood', 'find', 'out', 'flashbacks', 'Fast', 'Forward', 'sometime', 'Gotham', 'City', 'turf', 'war', 'going', 'Black', 'Mask', 'new', 'criminal', 'named', 'Red', 'Hood', 'Red', 'Hood', 'see', 'trying', 'clean', 'up', 'Gotham', 'controlling', 'criminal', 'activity', 'streets', 'Black', 'Mask', 'methods', 'are', ""n't"", 'respectable', 'say', 'least', 'attention', 'Batman', 'who', 'quickly', 'out', 'who', 'Red', 'Hood', 'why', 'doing', 'things', 'way', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'things', 'are', 'rather', 'complex', 'tale.I', 'was', 'especially', 'impressed', 'voice', 'talents', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'John', 'DiMaggio', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'Wade', 'Williams', 'made', 'feature', 'quite', 'believable', 'disagree', 'others', 'Kevin', 'Conroy', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'missing', 'respective', 'roles', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', ""'ve"", 'pulled', 'off', 'quite', 'believable', 'story.At', 'rate', 'loved', 'animated', 'feature', 'look', 'forward', 'Warner', 'Premier', 'DC', 'next', 'project']",Batman: Under the Red Hood

Bruce Greenwood does an excellent portrayal of Batman that is comparable to Kevin Conroy (GASP!) and John Dimagggio follows in the footsteps of Mark Hammil masterfully. Jense Ackles plays the Red Hood and does a decent job despite his limited acting ability. What makes this such an excellent movie is how all the characters are integrated together without feeling cluttered. Black Mask, Ras al Ghul, the Joker all play an equal part in this intricately woven tale. Some of the other Animated films, specifically the  Justice League ones feel too cluttered and the characters tend to lose themselves. What really makes this film stand tall above the rest is the flashbacks to Batman and Jason Todd in the early years. We get an inside look into the relationship between Batman and Robin as well as how a young Robin grows into a cocky, brash, and violent teenager. Nightwing is a great addition as well. We have never seen many team ups of Batman and Nightwing in the Animated Universe and watching them take on AMAZO and chase down the Red Hood was really fun to watch.This is one of the better Batman films, but Parents beware, its violent. Put your kids to bed so Dad can watch it by himself. After watching this realtively short film, it leaves you craving a spiritual successor to Batman The ANimated Series; perhaps one with hour long episodes, overarching stories, and more adult themes.

Although I liked the two films done in the reboot, I'm not really tempted to re-watch them. ""The Dark Knight"", in particular, was so unremittingly tense, with no breaks whatsoever to give the viewer breathing room, that while I regard it as an excellent film, I have no desire to go through that again.This plot in the animated film shows how to achieve the balance that ""The Dark Knight"" failed at. While the story IS dark and tense, there are humorous moments, especially from the mouth of Nightwing, that prevent it from pushing the viewer farther and farther down with no relief.The story is about the rise of a new crimial, The Red Hood. This guy is fully as homicidal as the Joker, aothough his cold blooded killing seems to be reservered for Gotham's criminal elements. In fact, if it weren't for his cold blooded mass murders, one might well approve of his actions, as he seems to be pitting the worst and most powerful of Gotham's criminals against each other. When he proves seemingly superior in fighting ability and acrobatics to both Batman and Nightwing, questions arise as to just who this remarkable new man on the scene could be.It is a mystery that Batman quickly solves, and the answer is just as shocking to the viewer as it is to the Batman himself. The solutions to the story bring us a rich plot that belies and surpasses the animated nature of the movie.The animation is a visual treat, and contains enough frame by frame detail to make you forget it is animation. From backgrounds to facial expressions (even behind the masks), much attention was paid to making sure this came across as a rich environment.The voices performances were outstanding across the board. Bruce Greenwood's as Batman is entirely natural and believable. As much as I like Mark Hamill, this Joker to me was a big step up. He came across to me much more believably as the sociopathic killer and sadist the Joker is made out to be, but has so often seemed forced in other performances. I was entirely captivated by the performances, without a break in the illusion of either the story or the animated format. That's hard to do, and is a credit to both the animation and the acting. It is a very mature story and set of themes which at once legitimately bring into question the Batman's methods, yet validates them. Again, that's a feat which is hard to accomplish in any film, and it is brought off here solidly.I think anyone can enjoy this film.

The action is amazing, fast paced, edgy and very well animated and the story itself (including dialogue)is very impressive but make no mistake, the violence, though not gory, is there, it doesn't pull any punches and is a departure from other batman animated movies. I personally enjoyed it since it added to the tension and seriousness of the overall story line. The voice acting was alright. Idk if some of the people chosen to do the voices should have been. Batman, Night Wing and the joker all seemed off, vocally, to me. It didn't take away from the movie but it was noticeable to me. Batman is darker and harder which is a welcome reprieve from the usual mainstream dark and brooding attitude we are used to seeing. Batman's response to the Red Hoods points about dealing with certain super criminals was dark, straight to the point and unexpected and was something, I feel, fans have needed to hear from him for some time.

Perhaps that's the most important qualifier - this is an animated film designed for adults, mostly Gen X like myself who grew up on the 1990s animated series.  In spite of our matured tastes, we still appreciate their bringing a good solid romp such as this to us in the present day.In the tradition of ""Superman: Doomsday"" and others, the tone is darker, the themes more adult, the violence more gritty and sometimes disturbing.  The animation is more refined, and certain much-beloved voices while in absentia, are done proud by their replacements.  If you don't think so, compare this ""update"" of the Joker with the one from ""The Batman"" series which many never warmed to.While I agree that Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill are an irreplaceable Batman and Joker and that change for change's sake is anathema to any true fan, I will say that these voices seemed a good fit for the animation and storyline.  It just felt more... evolved.  Grown.  I would have been a bit disturbed to see a story like this voiced by such beloved heavy-hitters as Conroy and Hamill.  This is not their time or place, and the movie reflects that.I will leave the minutia of the tale to others, except to mention that this was a remarkably true-to-form retelling of the comic storyline featuring Jason Todd's resurrection.  Very little was changed, and many of the story points were succinctly included without detracting from the rest.  What adjustments were made served to tighten the storyline and remove potential confusion, and this was well-executed.One last note: the comic book ending to this story was never given, due to the ""One Year Later"" storyline disrupting all DC events, and I found the one provided here to be true to form and dissatisfying in just the right way that the story needed.So yes, as I said at the start, an excellent film for what it is.

1338198,A239PPUVV8O0U0,B003ES5JDS,D. A. Reed,"[3, 3]","When I first subscribed to DC Comics 5 years ago, this storyline was already underway. Though knowing the backstory of Jason Todd's death and Joker's identity as the original Red Hood, I was still very confused. I didn't really attach to the story and even now, I don't really get modern comics, my tastes lying back in the Golden and Silver Age (even some tales of the '70s), so when I heard that this was the next film the DCU line, I was a little disappointed. But now that I've seen it, I now consider it my second favorite animated Batman movie.The first few minutes detail the pivotal events that occurred in the ""Death in the Family"" storyline of the late '80s. I'll admit I thought the scenes with Joker thrashing Robin with the crowbar would be a lot more brutal, but I was nonetheless shocked with the end result. When I mentioned last time that less is more (heck I even had a discussion about that topic with a customer where I work, which I found eerie), it proves that we don't need to see the Joker strike him every time. Once was enough and after that, most of it was done in shadow or off-screen, which is really all the audience needs to know that this kid is being tortured to within an inch of his life. When the movie flashes forward and Batman has recollections about the times he and Todd worked together, it shows that he was similar to Dick Grayson in his youth but as Jason grew into his teens, he attempted to take the law into his own hands. Batman's reacts with sorrow and regret as he faces his past, and it was a nice touch when was talking about how he'd like nothing better to kill Joker but knows that he could never return from that path.The animation was crisp and the characters looked great, though on the cover of the DVD and on the menus, the characters reflect how they appeared in the comics but in the actual film, they didn't really have any resemblance. New Frontier and Public Enemies, while being adapted to Bruce Timm's style, still had a passing resemblance to how they appeared in those books. Black Mask however, didn't look as intimidating. Even in The Batman, he looked more of a threat (I don't think they added pupils in that version).This voice cast is one of the best they've pulled off so far. Since Batman first appeared in New Frontier, we've gone through four different actors, and, Conroy aside, each has been able to make the role their own for that particular movie. Bruce Greenwood is no acception, bringing the pain and anguish that Batman is feeling as he sees his former partner alive really shows in his performance. Jensen Ackles makes Red Hood psychotic but during the scene when he and Batman fight off the guys with the ""lightsabers"" (were they in the comic?), he has Jason feel nostalgic about the adventures they had before. Neil Patrick Harris brought some levity as Nightwing to an otherwise dark film and it was welcome. None of his sarcastic remarks didn't come off as forced or inappropriate. As for the villains; though Mark Hamill will always remain my favorite, John DiMaggio was funny and lethal as the Joker, one of my favorite scenes being when he and Black Mask are in the prison cell. Though I felt out of place (I was watching this with my family) when I started laughing with all the dead guys lying around. I'm a very morbid person. Jason Isaacs was great as Ra's al Ghul and I almost wish (the key word being almost) that he had done the voice for Batman: TAS. Though he and Batman are enemies, he had no intention of Robin dying and he revived Robin with, I think anyway, good intentions (though even he should've realized that the Lazarus Pit would drive Jason crazy). Wade Williams, while good as Black Mask, seemed over the top. With all the yelling and screaming, I had very hard time of thinking of him as a threat. Again, the interpretation seen in The Batman was done very well, an unknown person with a very large organization, who had a deep gravelly voice supported the mystery behind that skull.The Jonah Hex short I wasn't too crazy about. All power to those who do like the character though, this is just my opinion but outside of his appearances in Batman and JLU, he didn't come off to me as an impressive character. Also judging by the live action film that was just released, it didn't look all that impressive, for the Wild West, there sure were a lot of explosions (and it had Megan Fox, which also probably didn't help it). It did have some good points though, the animation was great and the voice cast was good.",5,Second Favorite Animated Batman Movie,1280188800,"07 27, 2010",2010,4526,"['When', 'first', 'subscribed', 'DC', 'Comics', '5', 'years', 'ago', 'storyline', 'was', 'already', 'underway', 'knowing', 'backstory', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'death', 'Joker', 'identity', 'original', 'Red', 'Hood', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'confused', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'attach', 'story', 'even', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'modern', 'comics', 'tastes', 'lying', 'back', 'Golden', 'Silver', 'Age', 'even', 'tales', ""'70s"", 'so', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'next', 'film', 'DCU', 'line', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'now', 'consider', 'second', 'favorite', 'animated', 'Batman', 'movie.The', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'detail', 'pivotal', 'events', 'occurred', 'Death', 'Family', 'storyline', 'late', ""'80s"", ""'ll"", 'admit', 'thought', 'scenes', 'Joker', 'thrashing', 'Robin', 'crowbar', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'brutal', 'was', 'nonetheless', 'shocked', 'end', 'result', 'When', 'mentioned', 'last', 'time', 'less', 'more', 'heck', 'even', 'had', 'discussion', 'topic', 'customer', 'where', 'work', 'found', 'eerie', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'Joker', 'strike', 'time', 'Once', 'was', 'enough', 'most', 'was', 'done', 'shadow', 'off-screen', 'really', 'audience', 'know', 'kid', 'being', 'tortured', 'inch', 'life', 'When', 'movie', 'forward', 'Batman', 'recollections', 'times', 'Todd', 'worked', 'together', 'was', 'similar', 'Dick', 'Grayson', 'youth', 'Jason', 'grew', 'teens', 'attempted', 'take', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'Batman', 'reacts', 'sorrow', 'regret', 'past', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'when', 'was', 'talking', 'how', ""'d"", 'like', 'nothing', 'better', 'kill', 'Joker', 'could', 'never', 'return', 'path.The', 'animation', 'was', 'crisp', 'characters', 'looked', 'great', 'though', 'cover', 'DVD', 'menus', 'characters', 'reflect', 'how', 'appeared', 'comics', 'actual', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'resemblance', 'New', 'Frontier', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'being', 'adapted', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'style', 'still', 'had', 'passing', 'resemblance', 'how', 'appeared', 'books', 'Black', 'Mask', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'intimidating', 'Even', 'Batman', 'looked', 'more', 'threat', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'added', 'pupils', 'version', '.This', 'voice', 'cast', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'pulled', 'off', 'so', 'far', 'Batman', 'first', 'appeared', 'New', 'Frontier', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'four', 'different', 'actors', 'Conroy', 'aside', 'been', 'able', 'make', 'role', 'own', 'particular', 'movie', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'acception', 'bringing', 'pain', 'anguish', 'Batman', 'feeling', 'former', 'partner', 'alive', 'really', 'performance', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'Red', 'Hood', 'psychotic', 'scene', 'when', 'Batman', 'fight', 'off', 'guys', 'lightsabers', 'were', 'comic', 'Jason', 'feel', 'nostalgic', 'adventures', 'had', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'brought', 'levity', 'Nightwing', 'otherwise', 'dark', 'film', 'was', 'welcome', 'None', 'sarcastic', 'remarks', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'forced', 'inappropriate', 'villains', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'will', 'always', 'remain', 'favorite', 'John', 'DiMaggio', 'was', 'funny', 'lethal', 'Joker', 'one', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'being', 'when', 'Black', 'Mask', 'are', 'prison', 'cell', 'felt', 'place', 'was', 'watching', 'family', 'when', 'started', 'laughing', 'dead', 'guys', 'lying', 'around', ""'m"", 'very', 'morbid', 'person', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'was', 'great', 'Ra', 'al', 'Ghul', 'almost', 'wish', 'key', 'word', 'being', 'almost', 'had', 'done', 'voice', 'Batman', 'TAS', 'Batman', 'are', 'enemies', 'had', 'intention', 'Robin', 'dying', 'revived', 'Robin', 'think', 'anyway', 'good', 'intentions', 'even', 'should', ""'ve"", 'realized', 'Lazarus', 'Pit', 'would', 'drive', 'Jason', 'crazy', 'Wade', 'Williams', 'while', 'good', 'Black', 'Mask', 'seemed', 'top', 'yelling', 'screaming', 'had', 'very', 'hard', 'time', 'thinking', 'threat', 'Again', 'interpretation', 'seen', 'Batman', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'unknown', 'person', 'very', 'large', 'organization', 'who', 'had', 'deep', 'gravelly', 'voice', 'supported', 'mystery', 'skull.The', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'short', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'crazy', 'power', 'who', 'do', 'character', 'just', 'opinion', 'appearances', 'Batman', 'JLU', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'impressive', 'character', 'Also', 'judging', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'released', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'impressive', 'Wild', 'West', 'sure', 'were', 'lot', 'explosions', 'had', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'also', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'did', 'have', 'good', 'points', 'animation', 'was', 'great', 'voice', 'cast', 'was', 'good']",Batman: Under the Red Hood

1338202,A1J1K3X8ZMB5WD,B003ES5JDS,David Stager,"[16, 20]","I have to classify this movie as a minor masterpiece.  I give most of the credit to the screenwriter.  Hollywood's live-action superhero movie producers and writers can learn a lesson here about how to write a screenplay properly when creating comics-based movies.  The problems have always been the fact that there is a big audience that knows the stories and a large audience that does not know the stories.  The major comics-based movies are all tainted by the supposed need to explain everything and introduce characters to those who know nothing.  Likewise, they have to depart from directly adapting the beginning, middle, and ending of previously published stories - no matter how good the original stories may be.  These supposed limits have resulted in a long string of mediocre live-action superhero movies.However, this script deftly and effectively provides all necessary backstory and context so seamlessly and effortlessly that I have to wonder why the big studios never tell the story and make the movies the way it is done here.  That this movie is animated is no explanation.  With all the advances in live-action, this identical movie could be made with actors, sets, special effects and CGI no problem.  The tools of movies are not the problem with movies.  It's always been the writing that limits comics-based movies.All the Batman fans are familiar with the story and know all the spoilers.  That problem is dealt with masterfully by the script by weaving it into the tale early on.  The 50 years of comic history Hollywood would tediously explain to a new audience is dealt with perfectly using brief, in-context flashbacks, imagery and dialogue that never interrupts the story.  The professionalism and polish of the script is in ""Casablanca"" territory.  Every line and scene moves the story, nothing is left out that is needed and nothing is put in that isn't.The voice acting is good.  The actor playing the Joker is the best Joker voice yet.  I have no idea how Andrea Romano is able to cast these DC animated movies so well and keep picking the right voices.  Not a false note among any of the casting choices.  The characters here ring true to form.  I think they really got this one right.  The Marvel animated producers and creators are put to shame again.",5,A lesson to Hollywood: How to write a comics based movie,1279497600,"07 19, 2010",2010,2287,"['have', 'classify', 'movie', 'minor', 'masterpiece', 'give', 'most', 'credit', 'screenwriter', 'Hollywood', 'live-action', 'superhero', 'movie', 'producers', 'writers', 'can', 'learn', 'lesson', 'here', 'how', 'write', 'screenplay', 'properly', 'when', 'creating', 'comics-based', 'movies', 'problems', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fact', 'big', 'audience', 'stories', 'large', 'audience', 'not', 'know', 'stories', 'major', 'comics-based', 'movies', 'are', 'tainted', 'supposed', 'need', 'explain', 'everything', 'introduce', 'characters', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'Likewise', 'have', 'depart', 'directly', 'adapting', 'beginning', 'middle', 'ending', 'previously', 'published', 'stories', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'original', 'stories', 'may', 'be', 'supposed', 'limits', 'have', 'resulted', 'long', 'string', 'mediocre', 'live-action', 'superhero', 'movies.However', 'script', 'deftly', 'effectively', 'necessary', 'backstory', 'context', 'so', 'seamlessly', 'effortlessly', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'big', 'studios', 'never', 'tell', 'story', 'make', 'movies', 'way', 'done', 'here', 'movie', 'animated', 'explanation', 'advances', 'live-action', 'identical', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'actors', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'CGI', 'problem', 'tools', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'problem', 'movies', 'always', 'been', 'writing', 'comics-based', 'Batman', 'fans', 'are', 'familiar', 'story', 'know', 'spoilers', 'problem', 'dealt', 'masterfully', 'script', 'weaving', 'tale', 'early', '50', 'years', 'comic', 'history', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'tediously', 'explain', 'new', 'audience', 'dealt', 'perfectly', 'using', 'brief', 'in-context', 'flashbacks', 'imagery', 'dialogue', 'never', 'story', 'professionalism', 'polish', 'script', 'Casablanca', 'territory', 'line', 'scene', 'moves', 'story', 'nothing', 'left', 'out', 'needed', 'nothing', 'put', ""isn't.The"", 'voice', 'acting', 'good', 'actor', 'playing', 'Joker', 'best', 'Joker', 'voice', 'yet', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'Andrea', 'Romano', 'able', 'cast', 'DC', 'animated', 'movies', 'so', 'well', 'keep', 'picking', 'right', 'voices', 'Not', 'false', 'note', 'casting', 'choices', 'characters', 'here', 'ring', 'true', 'form', 'think', 'really', 'got', 'one', 'right', 'Marvel', 'animated', 'producers', 'creators', 'are', 'put', 'shame', 'again']",Batman: Under the Red Hood

1338204,AYRFLAT8VF732,B003ES5JDS,"DC_Fan_52 ""-Weasel!""","[1, 1]","If you don't like anime and hated ""The Batman Vs. Dracula,"" then this is the first pure Dark Knight cartoon since 2003's Mystery of the Batwoman. And I am pleased to say, this is the greatest Batman animated feature since Mask of the Phantasm.The mysterious new Red Hood rolls into Gotham and tries to control the Gotham gangs with Batman and Nightwing caught in the middle. Bruce Greenwood, Jensen Ackles, John DiMaggio, and Neil Patric Harris do a superb job in their roles. Special mention should go to Neil Patric Harris who does an absolutely perfect performance as Nightwing. On the other hand, John DiMaggio provides a different voice for the Joker than we all are used to, deeper and a bit reserved, compared to the loony, cackling Joker that Mark Hamill and Heath Ledger used. Despite this, the Joker really steals whatever scene he's in.This is all because it's written and plotted so perfectly. There's plenty of action that will keep you glued to the screen, but there's also a great conflict in this story that is a hallmark of all great Batman lore. Not just the Joker, but Batman, Nightwing, and the Red Hood are written true to themselves that any fan of the comic book will instantly recognize them. If you're not a fan of the comic book. that won't affect your enjoyment of this movie. It's been perfectly adapted from the source material, so that all the problems have been ironed out.I should say, though, Robin III (Tim Drake) isn't in this movie at all.They really covered their bases with the Extras on this Blue-ray. Two documentaries ""Robin: The Story of Dick Grayson"" and ""Robin's Requiem: The Tale of Jason Todd"" really fill in the blanks for the average fan that doesn't know the history of Batman, Nightwing, and Robin.Also included on the Blu-ray, four episodes from Batman the Animated Series: ""Robin's Reckoning, Parts 1 & 2,"" - which details the origin of Robin, ""Mad Love"" - where the Joker meets Harley Quinn, and ""The Laughing Fish,"" when the Joker tries to copyright a face on a fish. These four are really great parallels to the movie, besides being phenomenal all by themselves.Plus, a First Look at Superman/Batman: Apocalypse, which can only be better than the last one. We hope.And of course, the 11-Minute Jonah Hex cartoon. It has good animation, but what really stands out to me is the excellent music direction.Some trailers pad out the rest of the disk.But if you only get the Two-Disk edition, you don't get the ""Jason Todd Documentary"" or ""Mad Love"" or ""The Laughing Fish.""If you have a Blu-ray Player, don't hesitate to get the blu-ray edition. You don't want to miss all that good stuff. Great adaptation. Great acting. Superb animation. Awesome extras. A five-out-of-five. For Batfans, and people who love cartoons. What's the greatest Batman cartoon movie? It's either this or Mask of the Phantasm, and if you already own Mask, get this already.The only thing missing are the commentaries. This is Blu-ray.

While other Batman animated movies have been decent, I was expecting this to be similar and nothing more than a rental. However, after watching it, it just made me go WOW.PROS.STORY (NO SPOILERS): As you know in DC comics, story has come up to the point that Batman is on his third Robin. This story takes place between Second and Third robin. It is about identity of a masked man that is amazingly almost as skilled as Batman himself. In this journey, Batman will encounter quite a few familiar and not so familiar faces. If you are a follower of Batman, YOU WILL LOVE THE SUSPENSE IN THE STORY.ANIMATION: No need to speak here. Will make you go WOW as before.ACTION: Unlike some of the previous batman animated films, it had a great deal of action. Special thing to note was action and choreography were simply spectacular. Batman using his gadgets to save himself from the fall, using hidden C4 on enemies in a manner they don't see coming and action of such matter looked quite natural truly fantastic.CONS.The only con. I found in this movie was to save this film from ESRB system, they had very little blood in it. While blood and gore don't make a good movie, but if someone were to be blown by tons of TNT, I would at least expect them to be burned or bleed little. But for some strange reason they don't. Oh well, I am presuming most who are going to watch this movie are gonna be kids. So works for them.CONCLUSION:To Batman fans, I would say this is a MUST BUY.

The Joker here is no less disturbing than Heath Ledger's performance. Admittedly the creators, writers and voice actor John DiMaggio(Bender of Futurama) were clearly influenced by Ledger's Joker both in look and attitude, but capturing it that well is like trapping lightening in a bottle. Joker's actions are also true to some of his more twisted acts in the comics, particularly his wanton murder of the second Robin, which jarringly opens the film. Also, heavily, but convincingly adapted, is the introduction of the Red Hood as one of Batman's most devastating adversaries. Credit is due Andrea Romano, who serves as voice director for almost all of these films. Perennial character actor Bruce Greenwood is perfectly cast as a seemingly older, emotional conflicted and often fatherly Batman. Jensen Ackles as Red Hood and Neil Patrick Harris as Nightwing are solid if sometimes a bit overwrought. The dichotomy and parallels between Nightwing and Red Hood are expertly presented with subtlety both in dialog and actions. This is at once a dark and little known corner of Bat-fiction and yet is is presented devoid of oversimplification or over-explanation. None of which should be surprising from an animation division that knows and respects its subject matter and its fans.

Being a Marvel fan it was hard to say that but it is true.  Having read the original ""Red Hood"" story I can say that I did enjoy the comic but not as much as the movie. (isn't that usually the opposite?)  I really enjoyed the emotion behind ""the Batman family"" and speaking of, Neal Patrick Harris was truly inspired as Nightwing.  But I can't go on without mentioning Bruce Greenwood and his perfect portrayal of Batman.

1338218,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B003ES5JDS,E. David Swan,"[0, 0]","`Under the Red Hood' has a huge advantage going for it in that it's working from a great storyline with mountains of emotional potential. The plot harkens back to 1988 when the Joker (with the help of thousands of DC fans) killed the then current Boy Wonder, Jason Todd. In the comic Jason was brutally bludgeoned with a crowbar before being killed from an explosion. The film doesn't shy away from extreme violence including a thug who gets immolated on his own Molotov cocktail and I was impressed with how accurately they retained the comic death. One change that did bother me was the redesign of the red hood itself and that I cannot understand. The classic design of the red hood is very distinctive, carries a ton of history and shouldn't have been altered. But c'est la vie, I guess we just have to live with it.** Possible Spoilers **I don't know if spilling that the Red Hood IS Jason Todd is considered a spoiler since it's well established in the comics in a storyline that continues to this day and quite frankly Batman figures it out before the halfway point of the movie. The basic premise of the movie is that Jason Todd has returned as the titular Red Hood and has decided to manage crime his own way by becoming the crime boss of Gotham City. This is an interesting concept that that was used by Alan Moore in The League of Extraordinary Gentleman although it's quite a bit less fleshed out here. In fact the only crime Red Hood even commits (besides wanton killing) is extortion from the various criminal heads. He starts a war with the hyper aggressive current crime boss of Gotham City, Black Mask, but the war is only a means to an end and exists just to move the plot forward towards the films Raison d'tre; the bringing together of Jason, Batman and the Joker.The movie culminates in a spectacular battle between Batman and Jason which is choreographed (or I guess storyboarded) brilliantly. My only complaint is that Batman dishes out enough punishment that in the real world Jason Todd would be dead again five times over. The film climaxes with a powerful speech by Jason on the absurdity of allowing the Joker to continue to live after all the people he's killed (particularly Jason himself). There is one little problem with this scene. Batman is supposed to be right but Jason is the one making all the sense. As a die hard liberal I can unashamedly say that the Joker should be put down like a rabid dog. In the real world Batman's noble views on vigilante killing would be fine because society would take care of the Joker but in Gotham City the justice systems revolving door leaves Batman little choice. The idea is that if Batman kills just once he's started down that slippery slope and there's no going back which makes sense but why not just walk away when Jason offers to do the deed.The animation is inconsistent ranging from very good to about what you'd get on a television program. Luckily it's good at the important moments and the fights in particular are well done. I don't have a problem with violence and killing but I do take issue when it's gratuitous and the movie definitely skirted the edge of gratuitous if not plunging straight over. My final issue was the fact the there really is no plot resolution in the end and that's a tough one to swallow. I would probably wait for the price to get around $10 for this one because I just think it has a bit of room for improvement.",4,What's With the Hood Redesign??,1281052800,"08 6, 2010",2010,3427,"['Red', 'Hood', 'huge', 'advantage', 'going', 'working', 'great', 'storyline', 'mountains', 'emotional', 'potential', 'plot', 'back', '1988', 'when', 'Joker', 'help', 'thousands', 'DC', 'fans', 'killed', 'then', 'current', 'Boy', 'Wonder', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'comic', 'Jason', 'was', 'brutally', 'bludgeoned', 'crowbar', 'being', 'killed', 'explosion', 'film', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'extreme', 'violence', 'including', 'thug', 'who', 'immolated', 'own', 'Molotov', 'cocktail', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'accurately', 'retained', 'comic', 'death', 'One', 'change', 'did', 'bother', 'was', 'redesign', 'red', 'hood', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'classic', 'design', 'red', 'hood', 'very', 'distinctive', 'ton', 'history', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'altered', ""c'est"", 'la', 'vie', 'guess', 'just', 'have', 'live', 'Possible', 'Spoilers', '**I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'spilling', 'Red', 'Hood', 'IS', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'considered', 'spoiler', 'well', 'established', 'comics', 'storyline', 'day', 'quite', 'frankly', 'Batman', 'out', 'halfway', 'point', 'movie', 'basic', 'premise', 'movie', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'returned', 'titular', 'Red', 'Hood', 'decided', 'manage', 'crime', 'own', 'way', 'becoming', 'crime', 'boss', 'Gotham', 'City', 'interesting', 'concept', 'was', 'used', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentleman', 'quite', 'bit', 'less', 'fleshed', 'out', 'here', 'fact', 'only', 'crime', 'Red', 'Hood', 'even', 'wanton', 'killing', 'extortion', 'various', 'criminal', 'heads', 'war', 'hyper', 'aggressive', 'current', 'crime', 'boss', 'Gotham', 'City', 'Black', 'Mask', 'war', 'only', 'means', 'end', 'just', 'move', 'plot', 'forward', 'films', 'Raison', ""d'tre"", 'bringing', 'together', 'Jason', 'Batman', 'Joker.The', 'movie', 'culminates', 'spectacular', 'battle', 'Batman', 'Jason', 'choreographed', 'guess', 'storyboarded', 'brilliantly', 'only', 'complaint', 'Batman', 'out', 'enough', 'punishment', 'real', 'world', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'would', 'be', 'dead', 'again', 'five', 'times', 'over', 'film', 'climaxes', 'powerful', 'speech', 'Jason', 'absurdity', 'allowing', 'Joker', 'continue', 'live', 'people', 'killed', 'particularly', 'Jason', 'one', 'little', 'problem', 'scene', 'Batman', 'supposed', 'be', 'right', 'Jason', 'one', 'making', 'sense', 'die', 'hard', 'liberal', 'can', 'unashamedly', 'say', 'Joker', 'should', 'be', 'put', 'down', 'rabid', 'dog', 'real', 'world', 'Batman', 'noble', 'views', 'vigilante', 'killing', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'society', 'would', 'take', 'care', 'Joker', 'Gotham', 'City', 'justice', 'systems', 'revolving', 'door', 'Batman', 'little', 'choice', 'idea', 'Batman', 'just', 'once', 'started', 'down', 'slippery', 'slope', 'going', 'back', 'sense', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'walk', 'away', 'when', 'Jason', 'do', 'deed.The', 'animation', 'inconsistent', 'ranging', 'very', 'good', 'what', ""'d"", 'get', 'television', 'program', 'Luckily', 'good', 'important', 'moments', 'fights', 'particular', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'violence', 'killing', 'do', 'take', 'issue', 'when', 'gratuitous', 'movie', 'definitely', 'skirted', 'edge', 'gratuitous', 'not', 'plunging', 'straight', 'final', 'issue', 'was', 'fact', 'really', 'plot', 'resolution', 'end', 'tough', 'one', 'swallow', 'would', 'probably', 'wait', 'price', 'get', '10', 'one', 'just', 'think', 'bit', 'room', 'improvement']",Batman: Under the Red Hood

While not gory, the beating that the psychotic Joker puts on the Jason Todd Robin made my toes curl. It's certainly much stronger than we had seen previously in their animated material.That dark and uncomfortable tone lingers throughout the story and definitely gives this a darker edge and I think a strength. The story itself is simple and the mystery of who is under the Red Hood is pretty much telegraphed from the beginning, because that really isn't the point. Rather what we get here is an exploration of Batman's failures and guilt.Inevitably there will be some who complain that it's not Kevin Conroy or Mark Hamill doing the voices of Batman and Joker but I've actually enjoyed how DC have let other people try out their versions of these characters.Bruce Greenwood's Batman has a bit of the Christian Bale voice without being so over the top, I found it effective for the story. It took me a little while to warm up to John DiMaggio's Joker at first, but as the story went on found his mixture of seriousness and manic hysteria ideal for a Joker who is as psychotic as any we've ever seen.Similarly Jensen Ackles (as Red Hood) and Neil Patrick Harris (as Nightwing) effectively embodied their characters. Really there weren't any bad performances to my ear.In fact the only weakness I could really point to was the way the Black Mask was portrayed which made him largely comic an ineffectual rather than one of Batman's most challenging opponents.If you're worried about fitting this into comics continuity I can't really help you. It does appear to accurately reflect the A Death In The Family storyline where Jason Todd died, and at least one of the Joker's origins from The Killing Joke but how that relates to the current status quo is anyone's guess.",5,One Of DC's Strongest Direct To DVD Animations,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,2093,"[""'m"", 'little', 'behind', 'animated', 'DC', 'trying', 'catch', 'up', 'so', 'can', 'watch', 'parts', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'back', 'back.Under', 'Red', 'Hood', 'rough', 'adaptation', 'Judd', 'Winnick', 'own', 'writing', 'comics', 'title', 'rush', 'things', 'little', 'still', 'key', 'notes.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'tough', 'watch', 'not', 'gory', 'beating', 'psychotic', 'Joker', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'Robin', 'made', 'toes', 'curl', 'certainly', 'much', 'stronger', 'had', 'seen', 'previously', 'animated', 'dark', 'uncomfortable', 'tone', 'lingers', 'story', 'definitely', 'darker', 'edge', 'think', 'strength', 'story', 'simple', 'mystery', 'who', 'Red', 'Hood', 'pretty', 'much', 'telegraphed', 'beginning', 'really', ""n't"", 'point', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'exploration', 'Batman', 'failures', 'guilt.Inevitably', 'will', 'be', 'who', 'complain', 'not', 'Kevin', 'Conroy', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'doing', 'voices', 'Batman', 'Joker', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'DC', 'have', 'let', 'other', 'people', 'try', 'out', 'versions', 'characters.Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Batman', 'bit', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'voice', 'being', 'so', 'top', 'found', 'effective', 'story', 'took', 'little', 'while', 'warm', 'up', 'John', 'DiMaggio', 'Joker', 'first', 'story', 'went', 'mixture', 'seriousness', 'manic', 'hysteria', 'ideal', 'Joker', 'who', 'as', 'psychotic', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Similarly', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'Red', 'Hood', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'Nightwing', 'effectively', 'embodied', 'characters', 'Really', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'performances', 'ear.In', 'fact', 'only', 'weakness', 'could', 'really', 'point', 'was', 'way', 'Black', 'Mask', 'was', 'portrayed', 'made', 'largely', 'comic', 'ineffectual', 'rather', 'one', 'Batman', 'most', 'challenging', 'opponents.If', ""'re"", 'worried', 'fitting', 'comics', 'continuity', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'help', 'appear', 'accurately', 'reflect', 'A', 'Death', 'Family', 'storyline', 'where', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'died', 'least', 'one', 'Joker', 'origins', 'Killing', 'Joke', 'how', 'current', 'status', 'quo', 'anyone', 'guess']",Batman: Under the Red Hood

We were treated to many characters within the Batman mythos without having to go through any origin stories (e.g., Nightwing, Ra's al Ghul, Black Mask, Joker).  The only origin story that was presented (Robin II/Jason Todd/Red Hood) was integral to the storyline and shown in flashbacks.  There was also a reference to ""friends"" that were shot (i.e., Batgirl/Barbara Gordon) by the Joker.  I'm glad that DC has gotten over the hump of feeling like they have to introduce characters in their animated films lately.  Instead, they place these characters into intelligent films and focus on the stories themselves, relying mostly on fans' knowledge bases.  After all, who is buying these DVDs?  Probably not anyone who's never picked up a comic book before.The Jonah Hex short was entertaining as well.  I've never been a big fan of his (or Westerns in general), but I enjoyed watching this particular well-told story.Next up?  How about using the comedic Neil Patrick Harris as Nightwing again in a New Teen Titans animated film.  (""The Judas Contract,"" anyone?  Or actually ANY of the early stories from Marv Wolfman and George Perez.)  Or perhaps a tale including the events from ""A Killing Joke"" and Barbara Gordon's transformation into Oracle and the forming of the superheroine group Birds of Prey?",5,"Excellent, Intelligent Superhero Film",1281312000,"08 9, 2010",2010,1478,"['Thanks', 'not', 'dumbing', 'down', 'DC', 'storyline', 'closely', 'followed', 'Red', 'Hood', 'story', 'stories', 'comics', 'many', 'character', 'appearances', 'were', 'welcome', 'surprise', 'were', 'treated', 'many', 'characters', 'Batman', 'mythos', 'having', 'go', 'origin', 'stories', 'e.g.', 'Nightwing', 'Ra', 'al', 'Ghul', 'Black', 'Mask', 'Joker', 'only', 'origin', 'story', 'was', 'presented', 'Robin', 'II/Jason', 'Todd/Red', 'Hood', 'was', 'integral', 'storyline', 'shown', 'flashbacks', 'was', 'also', 'reference', 'friends', 'were', 'shot', 'i.e.', 'Batgirl/Barbara', 'Gordon', 'Joker', ""'m"", 'glad', 'DC', 'gotten', 'hump', 'feeling', 'have', 'introduce', 'characters', 'animated', 'films', 'lately', 'Instead', 'place', 'characters', 'intelligent', 'films', 'focus', 'stories', 'relying', 'mostly', 'fans', 'knowledge', 'bases', 'who', 'buying', 'DVDs', 'Probably', 'not', 'anyone', 'who', 'never', 'picked', 'up', 'comic', 'book', 'before.The', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'short', 'was', 'entertaining', 'as', 'well', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Westerns', 'general', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'particular', 'well-told', 'story.Next', 'up', 'How', 'using', 'comedic', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'Nightwing', 'again', 'New', 'Teen', 'Titans', 'animated', 'film', 'Judas', 'Contract', 'anyone', 'actually', 'ANY', 'early', 'stories', 'Marv', 'Wolfman', 'George', 'Perez', 'perhaps', 'tale', 'including', 'events', 'A', 'Killing', 'Joke', 'Barbara', 'Gordon', 'transformation', 'Oracle', 'forming', 'superheroine', 'group', 'Birds', 'Prey']",Batman: Under the Red Hood

Superman, Wonder Woman, Green lantern etc have been drawn so basic and blocky with so little detail that I pretty much gave up.Then I saw this Batman movie. It is drawn, written and acted much better than past versions.The movie was not a short movie by any means. It was very entertaining and the flow of the plot kept my attention from start to finish.Extras on the Bluray are awesome. There is a full Jonah Hex episode, past history videos of both Dick Grayson (1st Robin - Now Nightwing) and Jason Todd (2nd Robin). 4 extra episodes that were hand selected to show some back story and much more.I have read that the digital copy is very limited what programs can play it. I cannot verify this because I have not used my digital copy yet.SPOILERPeople can complain all they want that Jason Todd (the 2nd Robin) was ""brought back to life"" even though I have to agree, I was glad to see his whiney butt ended in past comics. It's a comic book people! Write your own comics if you don't like it. The way they brought him back actually intrigued me.

If Jonah isn't on the single disc for Red Hood, wait until the Showcase collection.The Dick Grayson as Robin documentary was what made me buy the two disc edition. The documentary wasn't good at all. It does not cover the character of Robin or Nightwing in depth, does not cover the character's appearances in other media (from the 1940s serials to the cartoons of the 1960s through Batman Brave & Bold...not even Batman TAS!).The two Robin episodes are nice (Robin's Reckoning Parts 1 & 2), but if you have the complete series of Batman TAS you don't need them.The Robin documentary mostly covers the psychology of the sidekick, and the psychology of comparing Batman to Robin and how they deal with parental loss differently.I'm telling you, as a fan of DC Documentaries as special features this is a dud. The 18 minute long Supergirl documentary in the Smallville Season 7 boxset was more comprehensive! The 14 minute Plastic Man history with the 1980s animated series DVD set was even more comprehensive!

1338225,AEDHD7LIGEKB2,B003ES5JDS,Fan Boy 15,"[4, 5]","Although I grew up on Robin (Dick Grayson) in the cartoons, Jason was the current Boy Wonder when I was buying comics. So I dugged the idea of a Jason Todd as Robin/Red Hood movie and hoped that his Robin years would finally be appreciated.  He got dissed when the ""fans"" voted him out and seem to favor Dick Grayson and Tim Drake as Robin. There's even a Dick Grayson featurette on the Special Edition. His Robin isn't even the star. Jason's Robin featurette is only available on the Blu-ray, which sucks big time. Like it or not, Batman has three ""sons"" (not counting Terry McGinnis), and it's time Jason gets his proper respect. This movie truly wasn't what I had hoped, but had a few okay parts. I wanted a less gory version of the Death in the Family storyline from the comics, they complied. But all the changes weren't cool. More Jason as Robin first would've been great, especially for folks unfamiliar with the storyline. I did like how bad ass Jason (Red Hood) was when battling Batman and Nightwing. But why was his Robin costume primarily red (like Tim's)in the flashbacks? Didn't Jason ware the same yellow cape, green shorts, original Robin costume that Dick wore, with minor if any changes? Tim originated the black cape, long red pants Robin costume. ONE IMPORTANT THING. The reason whey dvds aren't selling well anymore is because companies aren't packing them with nearly as much bonus content as before, and releasing 2-Disc editions with so limited an amount of content that it should be compiled onto one disc. DC/Warner's animated releases typically include the main feature (60-75 mins. long) on Disc 1 with preview or two as a bonus. HELLO, A PREVIEW IS NOT A BONUS. Disc 2 has one short documentary, a brief animated short, and two episodes from Batman or Justice League box sets that most of us already have. So it's a major rip-off. When they finaly stop putting out 2-Disc editions with only one disc worth of content and provide more actual bonus content altogether, then maybe more people will start buying instead of renting for a buck though Netflix or Redbox.",3,"It Was Okay, But Needed More Jason Todd as Robin backstory.",1280534400,"07 31, 2010",2010,2092,"['grew', 'up', 'Robin', 'Dick', 'Grayson', 'cartoons', 'Jason', 'was', 'current', 'Boy', 'Wonder', 'when', 'was', 'buying', 'comics', 'So', 'dugged', 'idea', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'Robin/Red', 'Hood', 'movie', 'hoped', 'Robin', 'years', 'would', 'finally', 'be', 'appreciated', 'got', 'dissed', 'when', 'fans', 'voted', 'out', 'seem', 'favor', 'Dick', 'Grayson', 'Tim', 'Drake', 'Robin', 'even', 'Dick', 'Grayson', 'featurette', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Robin', ""n't"", 'even', 'star', 'Jason', 'Robin', 'featurette', 'only', 'available', 'Blu-ray', 'big', 'time', 'not', 'Batman', 'three', 'sons', 'not', 'counting', 'Terry', 'McGinnis', 'time', 'Jason', 'proper', 'respect', 'movie', 'truly', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'had', 'hoped', 'had', 'few', 'okay', 'parts', 'wanted', 'less', 'gory', 'version', 'Death', 'Family', 'storyline', 'comics', 'complied', 'changes', 'were', ""n't"", 'cool', 'More', 'Jason', 'Robin', 'first', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'especially', 'folks', 'unfamiliar', 'storyline', 'did', 'like', 'how', 'bad', 'ass', 'Jason', 'Red', 'Hood', 'was', 'when', 'battling', 'Batman', 'Nightwing', 'why', 'was', 'Robin', 'costume', 'primarily', 'red', 'Tim', 'flashbacks', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Jason', 'ware', 'same', 'yellow', 'cape', 'green', 'shorts', 'original', 'Robin', 'costume', 'Dick', 'wore', 'minor', 'changes', 'Tim', 'originated', 'black', 'cape', 'long', 'red', 'pants', 'Robin', 'costume', 'ONE', 'IMPORTANT', 'THING', 'reason', 'whey', 'dvds', 'are', ""n't"", 'selling', 'well', 'anymore', 'companies', 'are', ""n't"", 'packing', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'bonus', 'content', 'releasing', '2-Disc', 'editions', 'so', 'limited', 'amount', 'content', 'should', 'be', 'compiled', 'one', 'disc', 'DC/Warner', 'animated', 'releases', 'typically', 'include', 'main', 'feature', '60-75', 'mins', 'long', 'Disc', '1', 'preview', 'two', 'bonus', 'HELLO', 'A', 'PREVIEW', 'IS', 'NOT', 'A', 'BONUS', 'Disc', '2', 'one', 'short', 'documentary', 'brief', 'animated', 'short', 'two', 'episodes', 'Batman', 'Justice', 'League', 'box', 'sets', 'most', 'already', 'have', 'major', 'rip-off', 'When', 'finaly', 'stop', 'putting', '2-Disc', 'editions', 'only', 'one', 'disc', 'worth', 'content', 'provide', 'more', 'actual', 'bonus', 'content', 'altogether', 'then', 'maybe', 'more', 'people', 'will', 'start', 'buying', 'instead', 'renting', 'buck', 'Netflix', 'Redbox']",Batman: Under the Red Hood

1338227,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B003ES5JDS,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[0, 0]","BATMANUNDER THE RED HOODBatman Under the Red Hood is a new DC Universe animated film based on a few different Batman comics that started with ""A death In the Family"". The story as I am sure you know by now centers around the death of Jason Todd, the second Robin. I will point out from the beginning this is no ""Mask of the Phantasm"" but is by no means a horrible film either. For those of us who read the comics already know basically what the deal is but it was still interesting in seeing how they would fit all that they wanted into an average length film. Did they accomplish what they needed to make this a classic, no, but it is not the worst the company has put out either.We start off with the Joker and Robin [Jason Todd] spending a wonderful night together all cozy with a crowbar. Well it is actually Joker who is cozy as he is beating young Todd to death and having a great time doing it. Batman is on his way but he does not make it in time as the Joker is gone and Robin is killed by a bomb. Fast forward and time has gone by as Bruce Wayne is still trying to cope with what happened. But it seems he is no longer the big fish in town and neither is Black Mask who's empire is falling to a new crime lord, the Red Hood. The Red Hood has been used by many people including most famously by the Joker, but who is this new guy who can out run and play Batman.So the race is one as Batman not only has to deal with Black Mask and this new guy named the Red Hood but it seems that the Joker is some how involved. Add in his former partner Night Wing is trying to help out where he can, by the way he was the first Robin but our boy wonder grew up. Now throw in a few more guys and events and you have one rushed and convoluted film, but it is still fun. But to be honest with all that is going on this film seems like it could have been a great miniseries for the DC Universe. But alas it was not meant to be as they crammed as much as they could into this film.That is over all the main problem with this film, to much in such a short time. Everything else seems fine from the animation to the voice acting. Speaking of voice acting John DiMaggio did an excellent job as the Joker in this film. Everyone else here does a good job as well and all the performances are top notch. Written by Judd Winick and directed by Brandon Vietti this film while heavily mixed with different stories does miss out on a lot that the books had. I could go into all that it missed but that is covered in other reviews but I do recommend reading all the comics.Also there is an excellent short animated film on Jonah Hex that I highly recommend, I really enjoyed it. It is about a lady, a working lady if you know what I mean, who lures drunk men upstairs only for them never to be seen again. It is just like I said a short film but it is very very good. Also we have a lot of in depth looks at other DC Universe films and two episodes from the excellent Batman animated series from the 90's, 2 about Robin and his origin. As well as an in depth look a Robin in a documentary called ""Robin: The Story of Dick Grayson"".This two disc set is very much worth the price and I do think you should get it when you have the chance. Sure this is far from a classic, well maybe not far because it had potential to be the best. But it fell a little short but remains a very entertaining film and 2-disc set, the special features alone are great. So if you are a fan of DC, Batman, The Joker, or just comics in general I say buy it.",5,GREAT TWO DISC SET,1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,3513,"['THE', 'RED', 'HOODBatman', 'Red', 'Hood', 'new', 'DC', 'Universe', 'animated', 'film', 'based', 'few', 'different', 'Batman', 'comics', 'started', 'A', 'death', 'Family', 'story', 'am', 'sure', 'know', 'now', 'centers', 'death', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'second', 'Robin', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'beginning', 'Mask', 'Phantasm', 'horrible', 'film', 'who', 'read', 'comics', 'already', 'know', 'basically', 'what', 'deal', 'was', 'still', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'how', 'would', 'fit', 'wanted', 'average', 'length', 'film', 'Did', 'accomplish', 'what', 'needed', 'make', 'classic', 'not', 'worst', 'company', 'put', 'out', 'either.We', 'start', 'off', 'Joker', 'Robin', '[', 'Jason', 'Todd', ']', 'spending', 'wonderful', 'night', 'together', 'cozy', 'crowbar', 'actually', 'Joker', 'who', 'cozy', 'beating', 'young', 'Todd', 'death', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'doing', 'Batman', 'way', 'not', 'make', 'time', 'Joker', 'gone', 'Robin', 'killed', 'bomb', 'Fast', 'forward', 'time', 'gone', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'still', 'trying', 'cope', 'what', 'happened', 'no', 'longer', 'big', 'fish', 'town', 'Black', 'Mask', 'who', 'empire', 'falling', 'new', 'crime', 'lord', 'Red', 'Hood', 'Red', 'Hood', 'been', 'used', 'many', 'people', 'including', 'most', 'famously', 'Joker', 'who', 'new', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'out', 'run', 'play', 'Batman.So', 'race', 'one', 'Batman', 'not', 'only', 'deal', 'Black', 'Mask', 'new', 'guy', 'named', 'Red', 'Hood', 'Joker', 'how', 'involved', 'Add', 'former', 'partner', 'Night', 'Wing', 'trying', 'help', 'out', 'where', 'can', 'way', 'was', 'first', 'Robin', 'boy', 'wonder', 'grew', 'up', 'Now', 'throw', 'few', 'more', 'guys', 'events', 'have', 'one', 'rushed', 'convoluted', 'film', 'still', 'fun', 'be', 'honest', 'going', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'miniseries', 'DC', 'Universe', 'alas', 'was', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'crammed', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'much', 'such', 'short', 'time', 'Everything', 'else', 'fine', 'animation', 'voice', 'acting', 'Speaking', 'voice', 'acting', 'John', 'DiMaggio', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'Joker', 'film', 'Everyone', 'else', 'here', 'good', 'job', 'well', 'performances', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'Written', 'Judd', 'Winick', 'directed', 'Brandon', 'Vietti', 'film', 'heavily', 'mixed', 'different', 'stories', 'miss', 'out', 'lot', 'books', 'had', 'could', 'go', 'missed', 'covered', 'other', 'reviews', 'do', 'recommend', 'reading', 'comics.Also', 'excellent', 'short', 'animated', 'film', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'highly', 'recommend', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'lady', 'working', 'lady', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'who', 'drunk', 'men', 'only', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'just', 'said', 'short', 'film', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'Also', 'have', 'lot', 'depth', 'looks', 'other', 'DC', 'Universe', 'films', 'two', 'episodes', 'excellent', 'Batman', 'animated', 'series', '90', '2', 'Robin', 'origin', 'As', 'well', 'depth', 'look', 'Robin', 'documentary', 'called', 'Robin', 'Story', 'Dick', 'Grayson', '.This', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'very', 'much', 'price', 'do', 'think', 'should', 'get', 'when', 'have', 'chance', 'Sure', 'far', 'classic', 'well', 'maybe', 'not', 'far', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'best', 'fell', 'little', 'short', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', '2-disc', 'set', 'special', 'features', 'alone', 'are', 'great', 'So', 'are', 'fan', 'DC', 'Batman', 'Joker', 'just', 'comics', 'general', 'say', 'buy']",Batman: Under the Red Hood

1338235,A29GGWB3GGQBO9,B003ES5JDS,GPeralta,"[0, 0]","Probably having just as much knowledge about the Batman mythos as any average Joe out there, I am glad to say that I thoroughly enjoyed ""Batman: Under the Red Hood.""The story itself is just as the advertisements have been talking about, everything revolving around just who exactly is this new person called the Red Hood. With Batman having taken down a good number of criminals and having already gone through two Robins in the process, it seems as if times are finally changing for the caped crusader. Having initially ruled over villains through fear, there still remain those who aren't intimidated by Batman and continue on their rampage around Gotham City. With this problem at hand, the Red Hood has taken it upon himself to clean up the crime Batman has left behind, not even fearing killing those who get in his way.As short as the running time for the movie is, the pacing is actually perfect with nothing feeling either too fast or too slow. Gaps in the story are explained with the help of flashbacks and don't remove from the experience at all during the movie and appearances from villains the Joker and Black Mask only add to the enjoyment of the film. Conclusion: Definitely not your typical B-rate direct to DVD movie.Special Features are standard for DC, with two documentaries covering the history of the first and second people to have played as Robin in the Batman mythos. Also tacked on (at least for the Blu-Ray version of the release) are two episodes from ""The Batman"" animated series, covering the backstory of the first Robin and two episodes from the original ""Batman: The Animated Series"" revolving around the Joker. While the Robin episodes make sense as an addition to this release, the two Joker ones seem more like they were added on last second in that they don't connect all that well to the film itself and are merely alright in terms of episode quality (the first, covering Harley's backstory is a fan favorite, but the second concerning the Joker and some fish was rather dull).For those who picked up the Target exclusive, the only additional content is a second disc, which contains the special features already on the first disc as well as two more episodes from the animated series I've yet to watch. I'd say if I had to choose again, I would have gladly gotten the amazon.com exclusive with the lithograph over a filler bonus disc any day.All in all, a great movie that was only slightly hindered with its filler special features.",4,"A Pretty Good Movie, Coming from Someone Who Didn't Read the Comic",1280448000,"07 30, 2010",2010,2473,"['Probably', 'having', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'knowledge', 'Batman', 'mythos', 'average', 'Joe', 'there', 'am', 'glad', 'say', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Batman', 'Red', 'Hood', 'story', 'just', 'advertisements', 'have', 'been', 'talking', 'everything', 'revolving', 'around', 'just', 'who', 'exactly', 'new', 'person', 'called', 'Red', 'Hood', 'Batman', 'having', 'taken', 'down', 'good', 'number', 'criminals', 'having', 'already', 'gone', 'two', 'Robins', 'process', 'times', 'are', 'finally', 'changing', 'caped', 'crusader', 'Having', 'initially', 'ruled', 'over', 'villains', 'fear', 'still', 'remain', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'intimidated', 'Batman', 'continue', 'rampage', 'Gotham', 'City', 'problem', 'hand', 'Red', 'Hood', 'taken', 'clean', 'up', 'crime', 'Batman', 'left', 'behind', 'not', 'even', 'fearing', 'killing', 'who', 'get', 'way.As', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'movie', 'pacing', 'actually', 'perfect', 'nothing', 'feeling', 'too', 'fast', 'too', 'slow', 'Gaps', 'story', 'are', 'explained', 'help', 'flashbacks', 'do', ""n't"", 'remove', 'experience', 'movie', 'appearances', 'villains', 'Joker', 'Black', 'Mask', 'only', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'Conclusion', 'Definitely', 'not', 'typical', 'B-rate', 'direct', 'DVD', 'movie.Special', 'Features', 'are', 'standard', 'DC', 'two', 'documentaries', 'covering', 'history', 'first', 'second', 'people', 'have', 'played', 'Robin', 'Batman', 'mythos', 'Also', 'tacked', 'least', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'release', 'are', 'two', 'episodes', 'Batman', 'animated', 'series', 'covering', 'backstory', 'first', 'Robin', 'two', 'episodes', 'original', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'revolving', 'Joker', 'Robin', 'episodes', 'make', 'sense', 'addition', 'release', 'two', 'Joker', 'ones', 'seem', 'more', 'were', 'added', 'last', 'second', 'do', ""n't"", 'connect', 'well', 'film', 'are', 'merely', 'alright', 'terms', 'episode', 'quality', 'first', 'covering', 'Harley', 'backstory', 'fan', 'favorite', 'second', 'concerning', 'Joker', 'fish', 'was', 'rather', 'dull', '.For', 'who', 'picked', 'up', 'Target', 'exclusive', 'only', 'additional', 'content', 'second', 'disc', 'special', 'features', 'already', 'first', 'disc', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'more', 'episodes', 'animated', 'series', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'watch', ""'d"", 'say', 'had', 'choose', 'again', 'would', 'have', 'gladly', 'gotten', 'amazon.com', 'exclusive', 'lithograph', 'filler', 'bonus', 'day.All', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'slightly', 'hindered', 'filler', 'special', 'features']",Batman: Under the Red Hood
1338236,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003ES5JDS,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Regarding the field of original animated direct-to-DVD movies, DC is kicking the crapdoodle out of Marvel. BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD, running at around 76 minutes, is another well-executed, highly charged superhero thriller, and it's dark and compelling, and never mind that I wasn't that into the Red Hood saga when it was in comics form. This movie improves on the comic book.Remember about 20 years ago when DC put out an 800 number so that you and I could call in to determine Robin's fate? And the votes came in, and that marked the end of the annoying second Boy Wonder. Since then, Robin's death has been regarded as Batman's greatest failure.BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD opens in Bosnia and has us reliving that story, with the Joker's savage beating and eventual murder of Jason Todd, with the Batman come too late to save him. Five years later, a new masked man's come to Gotham City, and he's playing both sides of the field, a vigilante vastly more ruthless than the Dark Knight and simultaneously a crime lord craving a slice of that crooked pie. The Red Hood believes he's saving Gotham by taking control of the city's criminal elements. Inexorably he carves out his own territory, digesting chunks of the Black Mask's empire, igniting a gang war. Batman finds himself caught in the middle, and then he begins to harbor a horrifying suspicion as to who's really under the Red Hood.Unlike in the comic book, there isn't much of a mystery regarding the Red Hood's true identity. Instead of the mystery element, we're enfolded in bits of powerful storytelling. Almost shattering. The strength of the narrative lies in how it keeps resurrecting themes of broken relationships and failed promises and warped vengeance and devastating guilt, and it's like picking and picking at a scab until the blood seeps. In their final showdown, the Red Hood fiercely justifies himself to Batman and, honestly, I think he makes some very valid points. For instance, how many deaths is Batman indirectly responsible for by allowing the Joker to live?Tim Drake, the third Robin, isn't here, and it's a good move. His presence would've made the story more cluttered. Instead, Batman gets an assist from Nightwing, and it sucks that Nightwing isn't in the movie more. Neil Patrick Harris absolutely does him justice and provides levity to a brooding tale, but then again Dr. Horrible can do no wrong. For a voice cast that's new to DC animation, these actors perform well and emotionally hook you in. I would never have thought of Bruce Greenwood to voice Batman, but he's very effective, although I hesitate to say that he makes Batman his own. I hear too much of Kevin Conroy in his performance. John Dimaggio as Joker takes a bit of getting used to, as well, but it's not bad. His verbals are deeper than Mark Hamill's, and it helps that this Joker is depicted as with more bulk. Jensen Ackles (SUPERNATURAL) makes the Red Hood an almost sympathetic and certainly tragic character. I have to say, I very much see where the Red Hood is coming from.Pretty good animation, even though Black Mask looks more like the Red Skull. Very good action, an appropriate dose of violence, with the Red Hood giving as good as he gets, although I like that he does get hit, he does get bloodied. Except that he's too stubborn to quit. Batman, of course, is Batman. This film earns its PG-13 rating just by virtue of its disturbing opening scene. The ""payoff"" moments take place off-screen, but you can't prevent those violent images from surfacing in your brain. Joker, deranged and taunting, applying that crowbar to Jason Todd. Even though DC makes the film more accessible by refraining from showing bruises or too much blood on Jason. Still, don't let the younger kids see this. Also, along the way, the Red Hood kills several times.Now can I please talk about the Jonah Hex animated short? It continues that stamp of excellence that so marked the Spectre animated short featured on the JUSTICE LEAGUE: CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS DVD. This gritty short captures the essence of what makes Jonah Hex work as an anti-hero more so than that live action disaster. Thomas Jane voices everyone's favorite scar-faced western bounty hunter, and Jane is loads better than Josh What's-his-face. The story finds Hex meting out his own uncompromising brand of frontier justice to a murderous madam (voiced by Linda Hamilton). And, if you already haven't heard, Warner Brothers is planning to release a DC Showcase DVD featuring four animated shorts: the Spectre short, this Jonah Hex one, the Green Arrow short which will be on the upcoming SUPERMAN/BATMAN: APOCALYPSE DVD, and a never before seen short: ""Superman/Shazam! - The Return of Black Adam."" Look for that DVD on November 2010.Back to BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD. I've got the 2-disc DVD set. Disc 1 has the feature presentation and includes a sneak peek (00:12:12 minutes long) at SUPERMAN/BATMAN: APOCALYPSE, which features the coming of Superman's cousin, Kara Zor El, a.k.a. Supergirl; the nice Jonah Hex animation short (00:11:53 minutes); and First Looks at JUSTICE LEAGUE: CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS (00:11:11 minutes), BATMAN: GOTHAM KNIGHT (00:10:09), SUPERMAN: DOOMSDAY (00:02:19); and trailers for THE LORD OF THE RINGS (Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film), the JONAH HEX Motion Comic, and LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS.Disc 2 presents: a segment titled ""Robin: The Story of Dick Grayson"" which delves into the roots and evolution of the original Robin the Boy Wonder (00:24:12); and Bruce Timm presents 2 episodes from BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES: ""Robin's Reckoning, Parts 1 & 2.

1338240,A26O0T192IBKY1,B003ES5JDS,J. Alford,"[0, 0]","Being the first full-length Batman animated movie in a long time that had one consistant story to it(Gotham Knight not withstanding), the latest movie, Under The Red Hood is a retelling of the Under The Hood story arc from the Batman comics. This is a bold new direction for DC Universe by taking a character they've tried selling as being more family-oriented in productions like Batman: Brave And The Bold, and bringing the one that most die-hard comic readers can identify with on the level of The Dark Knight.The story begins in the past with Joker under the payroll of Ra's Al Ghul keeping Batman and Robin #2(Jason Todd)busy while he tries yet again to take over the world. However, the Joker ""shockingly"" goes way overboard, and kills Robin. Fast forward to five years later where a new masked man called the Red Hood is shaking up things in Gotham City by slowly taking over territory of local crime lord, Black Mask. Batman busts up a delivery of an Amazo robot with the help of Nightwing, but the goons smuggling it are taken out by the Red Hood. Originally, the Red Hood was the alias that the Joker used before he was given his permanent skin bleach. Bats and Nightwing check with Joker in locked in Arkham to see if he's got any connection to this new Red Hood, but even your novice Bat-Fan could tell you the real Joker would've let you know if it was him. The Dynamic-former-Duo track down Hoodie robbing some pushers, but Nightwing hoits his widdle toe, and spends the rest of the movie on the bench. Black Mask sends out the Fearsome Hand Of Four after Red Mask, who are a team of cyber-ninjas original to the movie, but Batman shows up and they fold that deck together. Batman then deduces that R.H. is really Jason Todd, and takes the Batwing over to the other side of the world to have a chat with Ra's Al Ghul. Ra's revealed that he tried making amends for causing Jason to die by dipping him in his time-honored plot device, the Lazarus Pit. Jason came back, but pissed off as Hell, and escaped from Ra's. After hearing this, Batman zooms back to Gotham, to find that Black Mask sprung Joker out of Arkham to kill Red Hood, but Joker doublecrossed him(suprise!), and uses him as bait to lure out his current successor. Red Hood makes off with Joker, and gets Batman to meet him in Crime Alley. Red Hood unmasks to show is indeed Jason Todd. Jason then corners Batman into either choosing between shooting him or Joker, which he stops Jason, and the building they're in blows up. Batman and Joker survive, but Jason's fate remains unknown. The movie ends with Batman reflecting on when Jason first became Robin.First, I'd like to say how this movie differs from the comics. In the original context, Jason Todd was brought back to life mainly because the evil Superboy-Prime ""punched reality"", and made it so Jason came back to life, although recent retellings of Red Hood's origin also include him backstoking in a Lazarus Pit. There's ben alot of retconning involving Jason's resurrection, but the movie managed to pull it all together well. A few other things like the Black Mask hiring some C-List supervillains from the Secret Society instead of the ""Hand Of Four"" from the original story, although it makes more sense for them to have Batman taking on Mortal Kombat wannabes instead of Captain Nazi, even though they could've had them be the Royal Flush Gang or some other recognizable DC villains. There was also the rewrite of the Death In The Family story where Joker blows up Robin in the middle east, instead of Europe. Plus, no supervillain would ever be stupid or desperate enough to hire the Joker to do anything, and certainly not a criminal mastermind like Ra's Al Ghul! Nightwing was also a little to flippant in this, like freaking out over the Amazo shooting lasers at him, which he should be used to after being with the Titans. Another character who was out of place was Black Mask, who is usually alot more cool and calculating, where here he was way more hotheaded.As for the movie itself, I think this one has the best animation out of any of the other DC Universe movies, including some of the shorts from Gotham Knight. The city backgrounds look like it might be taking place in the actual downtown New York instead of fictional Gotham City, despite the fact that there are still police blimps in it. The character designs are awesome too, and Joker really looks menacing for once. Speaking of Mr. J, John DiMaggio(aka: ""Bender"")does a bang-up job as Joker by bringing in influences of both Mark Hamill and Heath Ledger. Bruce Greenwood is fair as Bats, but he's no Kevin Conroy. Jason Ackles is good as Jason Todd, and Neil Patrick Harris makes for a decent Nightwing. My only real low grade on the movie is that it should've ended on a more realistic note instead of just some happy flashback with young Jason Todd. The special edition DVD and Blu-Ray versions also feature a killer DC Showcase animated short of Jonah Hex starring Thomas Jane which is waaaay better than that crappy live-action movie, plus a decent documentary on Dick Grayson as Robin. So, in closing, I'd wholeheartedly demand that any Bat-Fan should store this in their cave between the giant penny and robot dinosaur!",4,Red Hood Begins,1284940800,"09 20, 2010",2010,5237,"['Being',

The movies are either too silly or too serious for my taste and the animated versions seem to keep trying to immitate the 1990's cartoon (with the exception of the fun 'Brave and the Bold'). While I wasn't completely sold on the original comic-story, Batman: Under the Red Hood mixes the darker sensibilities of modern Batman incarnations with the fun and emotional context of the 1990's animated series. The result is surprisingly good.Like the comic, Batman: Under the Red Hood involves a new vigilante in Gotham city named 'Red Hood'. Unlike Batman, Red Hood kills criminals but seems to be doing a more effective job at cleaning up the city than Batman ever did. As the Dark Knight investigates this new player he's forced to confront past tragedies as well as villains Black Mask and The Joker. The story (written by comics writer Judd Winick) doesn't always ring true and is told a bit un-evenly in parts (usually unvolving some rushed but neccessary exposition and a cool but out-of-place opening fight scene) but the emotional connections between each character keep things grounded and the final confrontation between Batman and the Red Hood is a knockout! The action scenes are also well done, even with the somewhat blocky character designs.The voice work is quite good for the most part. Bruce Greenwood won't make you forget Kevin Conroy but he's appropriatly brooding as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Wade Williams perfectly mixes fun and psychotic as Black Mask and Jason Isaacs and Neil Patrick Harris give brief but memorable contributions as Ra's al Ghul and Nightwing. I liked John DiMaggio as the Joker for no other reason than that he didn't remind me of any other incarnation (and if he sounds a bit 'off' I blame some uninspired dialogue). As good as these voice actor's were however it's really Jensen Ackles as the Red Hood and Vincent and Alexander Martella as the two different ages of Jason Todd that steal the show and bring real weight to their characters.While Batman: Under the Red Hood may not be the best Batman story ever, it is a VERY good one. If you're a Batman fan or just looking for a good superhero flick that won't waste too much time (at 75 minutes) this is definitly worth a look!",4,A solid Batman story....,1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,2277,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Batman', 'No', 'comics', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'great', 'movies', 'are', 'either', 'too', 'silly', 'too', 'serious', 'taste', 'animated', 'versions', 'seem', 'keep', 'trying', 'immitate', '1990', 'cartoon', 'exception', 'fun', 'Bold', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'sold', 'original', 'comic-story', 'Batman', 'Red', 'Hood', 'mixes', 'darker', 'sensibilities', 'modern', 'Batman', 'incarnations', 'fun', 'emotional', 'context', '1990', 'animated', 'series', 'result', 'surprisingly', 'good.Like', 'comic', 'Batman', 'Red', 'Hood', 'new', 'vigilante', 'Gotham', 'city', 'named', ""'Red"", 'Hood', 'Batman', 'Red', 'Hood', 'criminals', 'be', 'doing', 'more', 'effective', 'job', 'cleaning', 'up', 'city', 'Batman', 'ever', 'did', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'new', 'player', 'forced', 'confront', 'past', 'tragedies', 'as', 'well', 'villains', 'Black', 'Mask', 'Joker', 'story', 'written', 'comics', 'writer', 'Judd', 'Winick', ""n't"", 'always', 'ring', 'true', 'told', 'bit', 'un-evenly', 'parts', 'usually', 'unvolving', 'rushed', 'neccessary', 'exposition', 'cool', 'out-of-place', 'opening', 'fight', 'scene', 'emotional', 'connections', 'character', 'keep', 'things', 'grounded', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Batman', 'Red', 'Hood', 'knockout', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'even', 'somewhat', 'blocky', 'character', 'designs.The', 'voice', 'work', 'quite', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'forget', 'Kevin', 'Conroy', 'appropriatly', 'brooding', 'Batman/Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Wade', 'Williams', 'perfectly', 'fun', 'psychotic', 'Black', 'Mask', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'give', 'brief', 'memorable', 'contributions', 'Ra', 'al', 'Ghul', 'Nightwing', 'liked', 'John', 'DiMaggio', 'Joker', 'other', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'remind', 'other', 'incarnation', 'bit', 'blame', 'uninspired', 'dialogue', 'As', 'good', 'voice', 'actor', 'were', 'however', 'really', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'Red', 'Hood', 'Vincent', 'Alexander', 'Martella', 'two', 'different', 'ages', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'steal', 'show', 'bring', 'real', 'weight', 'characters.While', 'Batman', 'Red', 'Hood', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'Batman', 'story', 'ever', 'VERY', 'good', 'one', ""'re"", 'Batman', 'fan', 'just', 'looking', 'good', 'superhero', 'flick', 'wo', ""n't"", 'waste', 'too', 'much', 'time', '75', 'minutes', 'definitly', 'worth', 'look']",Batman: Under the Red Hood

I'd go as far as to say that it's the best animated movie that's been made. All other animated movies that have come out recently were always lack luster or you were never completely satisfied. With ""Under the Red Hood"", You definitely got your money's worth. The voice acting (And you've got to give it up to Andrea Romano for once again putting together an excellent cast) was superb. Big ups to Jensen Ackles as the Red Hood. Probably did the best job of the cast. Not to take away from any of the other voice actors who did fine jobs themselves. Notably John Dimaggio as the Joker who I thought made the Joker his own with his portrayal. Bruce Greenwood as the Batman was also dead on. Neil Patrick Harris did a pretty good job as Nightwing though he slipped up with the voice once or twice and seemed to use his regular speaking voice. He didn't have a very large role in the feature so it wasn't anything that took away from the movie. Wade Williams also did the Black Mask justice. His character was written a little over the top but Williams captured it very well. I think the fact Judd Winnick (the original writer of Under the Hood) writing the feature is definitely what made it as good as it was. He stayed very true to his original story but the changes he made to the original story still worked out very well. Not only did he take the 2 volumes that comprised the ""Under the Hood"" arc and combine them for the movie, he was also able to connect the events of ""A Death in the Family"" (Possible *SPOILER*) which is where Jason Todd meets his ultimate demise at the hands of the Joker. End of the day, Batman: Under the Red Hood was an excellent movie that you shouldn't miss.

1338260,A2X7NBUETXC19E,B003ES5JDS,Justin G.,"[2, 3]","DC has a great track record with direct to video animated movies, but with Batman: Under the Red Hood they've really outdone themselves. This powerful, dramatic and action-packed film is set a few years after the death of the second Robin, and finds Batman once again working solo and grimmer than ever. When a new vigilante/crime lord starts taking control of Gotham City's underworld, Batman is forced to come to terms with his past failures and take on an opponent every bit as skilled and driven as he is. The film features guest appearances from the Riddler, Ras al Ghul, Nightwing and the Joker.Main Program - This is, without a doubt, the best animated movie DC has released. I'm a huge fan of the classic `90s era DCU Animated series, but this film is just at a whole other level. The story pays tribute to the comic books while keeping things (relatively) simple enough for more casual fans to follow. It also takes a decidedly more mature direction than most animated features without wallowing in excessive gore or profanity. It's also amazing to look at. The character designs are compelling, and the action sequences are nothing short of breathtaking. I thought DC perfected this inSuperman: Doomsday [Blu-ray], but the fights between Batman and Robin and Amazo and later Batman and the Red Hood were some of the most stunning action sequences I've ever seen. It took some time getting used to the voice actors, particularly Batman and the Joker, but even that aspect of the film was handled quite well.Quality - The Blu-ray format really brings this movie to life. The sound and especially video quality are amazing, and there are times where you'd swear the characters were about to jump right out of the screen.Bonus Material - The Blu-ray is loaded with extras, including behind the scenes material, a handful of episodes from the Batman Animated Series, and a very cool Jonah Hex short animated film. Then there's the digital copy. For some reason, Warner insists on making this bonus feature incompatible with the iPod, you know, the device 99% of us use to watch digital copies. Those of us who use Macs are doubly screwed. I was sorely tempted to take a star away for this reason.If you're a Batman fan, this really is a must-have release. The quality of the various Batman Animated releases since the early `90s has always been quite high, but Under the Red Hood is the first animated release that's at a level withBatman Begins [Blu-ray] and evenThe Dark Knight (+ BD Live) [Blu-ray].",5,"Amazing film, stunning Blu-ray, but another unusable digital copy",1284508800,"09 15, 2010",2010,2507,"['DC', 'great', 'track', 'record', 'direct', 'video', 'animated', 'movies', 'Batman', 'Red', 'Hood', ""'ve"", 'really', 'outdone', 'powerful', 'dramatic', 'action-packed', 'film', 'set', 'few', 'years', 'death', 'second', 'Robin', 'Batman', 'once', 'again', 'working', 'solo', 'grimmer', 'ever', 'When', 'new', 'vigilante/crime', 'lord', 'taking', 'control', 'Gotham', 'City', 'underworld', 'Batman', 'forced', 'come', 'terms', 'past', 'failures', 'take', 'opponent', 'bit', 'skilled', 'driven', 'film', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Riddler', 'Ras', 'Ghul', 'Nightwing', 'Joker.Main', 'Program', 'doubt', 'best', 'animated', 'movie', 'DC', 'released', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'classic', '90s', 'era', 'DCU', 'Animated', 'series', 'film', 'just', 'whole', 'other', 'level', 'story', 'tribute', 'comic', 'books', 'keeping', 'things', 'relatively', 'simple', 'enough', 'more', 'casual', 'fans', 'follow', 'also', 'decidedly', 'more', 'mature', 'direction', 'most', 'animated', 'features', 'wallowing', 'excessive', 'gore', 'profanity', 'also', 'amazing', 'look', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'compelling', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'breathtaking', 'thought', 'DC', 'perfected', 'inSuperman', 'Doomsday', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'fights', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'Amazo', 'later', 'Batman', 'Red', 'Hood', 'were', 'most', 'stunning', 'action', 'sequences', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'took', 'time', 'getting', 'used', 'voice', 'actors', 'particularly', 'Batman', 'Joker', 'even', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'handled', 'quite', 'well.Quality', 'Blu-ray', 'format', 'really', 'movie', 'life', 'sound', 'especially', 'video', 'quality', 'are', 'amazing', 'are', 'times', 'where', ""'d"", 'swear', 'characters', 'were', 'about', 'jump', 'right', 'screen.Bonus', 'Material', 'Blu-ray', 'loaded', 'extras', 'including', 'scenes', 'material', 'handful', 'episodes', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'very', 'cool', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'short', 'animated', 'film', 'Then', 'digital', 'copy', 'reason', 'Warner', 'making', 'bonus', 'feature', 'incompatible', 'iPod', 'know', 'device', '99', '%', 'use', 'watch', 'digital', 'copies', 'who', 'use', 'Macs', 'are', 'doubly', 'screwed', 'was', 'sorely', 'tempted', 'take', 'star', 'away', 'reason.If', ""'re"", 'Batman', 'fan', 'really', 'must-have', 'release', 'quality', 'various', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'early', '90s', 'always', 'been', 'quite', 'high', 'Red', 'Hood', 'first', 'animated', 'release', 'level', 'withBatman', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'evenThe', 'Dark', 'Knight', '+', 'BD', 'Live', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']']",Batman: Under the Red Hood

Did this movie do the job of relating the story as best it could: Yes, it did!Voice Casting - Good & Bad. This always gets to me with these WB productions. For a company that has the excellent voice talent they already have with Kevin Conroy (Batman/Bruce Wayne) & Tim Daly (Superman/Clark Kent) just to name two actors, why do they feel the need to hire anybody else to do the job? With Batman: U.T.R.H., they did a decent job of getting most of the new voice casting right for this production: Bruce Greenwood, & Jensen Ackles voice Batman & Red Hood. Both actors do a great job, Greenwood even sounds like Kevin Conroy's Batman voice, so though he did a great job, why not just use Conroy? Voice failures go to John Di Maggio - the Joker, & (I hate to say it) Neil Patrick Harris - Nightwing. Di Maggio's Joker just is horrible, and he sounds bored reading his lines. Harris' Nightwing is just too goofy sounding. He makes a good Flash, but not Nightwing. Everyone else does a good job with their characters.So that's it!

Gave me the warm-fuzzies. Thank gawd the movie was done by the same guy who wrote the comics.Even though it deviates a lot from the story, & it's skimmed down, missing lots of characters, & adds distantly connected comic stories by other authors from different times, Winick managed to beautifly reimagine this story in a way that probably made more sence than the the comics.Okey, like the opening part takes place after ""A Death in the Family,"" which happened in the 80s. There should have been a woman there, one claiming to be Jason's mom who lured him into the Joker's trap. I guess they didn't want to introduce a character who would never appear again.In the comics, Batman never guessed who Red Hood was, he had to see him take off the mask, & even then he didn't believe it was really Jason. But this is taking from 3 different yet connected stories written many many years apart from eachother.This movie didn't exactly follow the comics; Black Mask never broke Joker out of Arkham; he was already out & moping about in the abandoned ammusement park he used to use as a hideout, & Black Mask never hired him. Black Mask's personal assistant was a man. Jason DID die, & his resurection has something to do with Superman. One of Ra's Al Ghul's men spots Jason & reports him to Ra's & they take him in to discover the mistery of his ressurection. Againt her father's wishes, Talia Al Ghul pushes Jason into the Lazerus pit, restoring his memories of who he was & how he died, then she helped him escape (her father was pretty pissed). Also, Ra's never hired Joker in the begining, Joker was overseas of his own accord.The universe in which Joker was the Red Hood was supposed to be destroyed in ""Absolute Crisis on Infinate Earths,"" so Winick oopsed on his continuity; everything that happened in the gold, silver, & bronze aged comics was retconed, but he used it for a plot device. The Joker's origin as the Red Hood was also unofficially retconed in ""Batman: Lovers & Madmen,"" the latest & longest Joker origin story. The Joker can also break out of & back into Arkham at his own liesure.The ending also deviates from the comics.

I plan on purchasing the movie now that it's available on DVD. Overall, this is a very dark Batman story, but not without some fun, and some great visuals.As I mentioned, the story itself is very dark. The movie opens with the death of the second Robin. From there, we go five years into the future where Batman is still protecting Gotham, but by himself. A vigilante named Red Hood has appeared on the scene and is stirring up trouble the criminal territory that Black Mask owns. Batman and Nightwing, the first Robin, head out to investigate this new vigilante, and end up on a chase around Gotham to discover his identity. Added into the mix is the Joker, who is causing mayhem as usual, and Ra's Al Ghul, who has more to do with the Red Hood than anyone would have guessed.Others have said this, and I agree, that this feels very remiscent of ""Batman: The Animated Series,"" which is definitely a good thing. Batman is dark and troubled by the death of his partner, which has stuck with him after all these years. Nightwing is only in the first half of the movie, but he's perfect as the good-natured, somewhat happy-go-lucky hero who has graduated from the role of Robin. The team-up between him and Batman in the beginning is a lot of fun. Black Mask is fun to watch as the eccentric, increasingly aggitated crime boss who just wants Red Hood dead. The Joker was also a good mix of lunatic and sinister. I was reminded of both the Batman: Animated Series Joker, and the Dark Knight's portrayal, with more of the former. Ra's Al Ghul also has a small role, but comes off very mysterious, and almost morose. I usually don't care for his charcter, but I actually did not mind him in this movie.The movie in filled with many flashbacks, which are very effective for the storytelling. A lot of them are location-triggered, which adds to the memory effect. The movie ends on a somewhat strange note, leaving me feeling a bit empty. I think it can be interpereted either positively or negatively, depending on how you look at it, which might have been the intention.All-in-all, I enjoyed this movie very much, and reccomend it for anyone looking for something similar to the Animated series, or just a good Batman movie. The violence in this movie is rather high for an animated feature (note the PG-13 rating), however, so I would not reccomend this film for children. There is blood, explosions, and deaths. The opening scene involves the Joker beating Robin with a crowbar, if that's any indication of the violence level. It's not gory or extremely explicit, but it's definitely not your standard Cartoon Network-level violence.",5,A Great Batman Movie,1280188800,"07 27, 2010",2010,2702,"['watched', 'Amazon.com', 'rental', ""'m"", 'impatient', 'plan', 'purchasing', 'movie', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'Overall', 'very', 'dark', 'Batman', 'story', 'not', 'fun', 'great', 'visuals.As', 'mentioned', 'story', 'very', 'dark', 'movie', 'death', 'second', 'Robin', 'there', 'go', 'five', 'years', 'future', 'where', 'Batman', 'still', 'protecting', 'Gotham', 'vigilante', 'named', 'Red', 'Hood', 'appeared', 'scene', 'stirring', 'up', 'trouble', 'criminal', 'territory', 'Black', 'Mask', 'Batman', 'Nightwing', 'first', 'Robin', 'head', 'investigate', 'new', 'vigilante', 'end', 'up', 'chase', 'around', 'Gotham', 'discover', 'identity', 'Added', 'mix', 'Joker', 'who', 'causing', 'mayhem', 'usual', 'Ra', 'Al', 'Ghul', 'who', 'more', 'do', 'Red', 'Hood', 'anyone', 'would', 'have', 'guessed.Others', 'have', 'said', 'agree', 'very', 'remiscent', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'definitely', 'good', 'thing', 'Batman', 'dark', 'troubled', 'death', 'partner', 'stuck', 'years', 'Nightwing', 'only', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'perfect', 'good-natured', 'somewhat', 'happy-go-lucky', 'hero', 'who', 'graduated', 'role', 'Robin', 'team-up', 'Batman', 'beginning', 'lot', 'fun', 'Black', 'Mask', 'fun', 'watch', 'eccentric', 'increasingly', 'aggitated', 'crime', 'boss', 'who', 'just', 'Red', 'Hood', 'dead', 'Joker', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'mix', 'lunatic', 'sinister', 'was', 'reminded', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'Joker', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'portrayal', 'more', 'former', 'Ra', 'Al', 'Ghul', 'also', 'small', 'role', 'off', 'very', 'mysterious', 'almost', 'morose', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'charcter', 'actually', 'did', 'not', 'mind', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'filled', 'many', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'very', 'effective', 'storytelling', 'lot', 'are', 'location-triggered', 'memory', 'effect', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'strange', 'note', 'leaving', 'feeling', 'bit', 'empty', 'think', 'can', 'be', 'interpereted', 'positively', 'negatively', 'depending', 'how', 'look', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'intention.All-in-all', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'reccomend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'something', 'similar', 'Animated', 'series', 'just', 'good', 'Batman', 'movie', 'violence', 'movie', 'rather', 'high', 'animated', 'feature', 'note', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'however', 'would', 'not', 'reccomend', 'film', 'children', 'blood', 'explosions', 'deaths', 'opening', 'scene', 'Joker', 'beating', 'Robin', 'crowbar', 'indication', 'violence', 'level', 'not', 'gory', 'extremely', 'explicit', 'definitely', 'not', 'standard', 'Cartoon', 'Network-level', 'violence']",Batman: Under the Red Hood

Had the history of Jason Todd been presented in a live action film of some sort, this would have been even better presented as such.  Script was outstanding, and I agree with others the PG-13 rating is warranted.  Before viewing, I was concerned about someone other than Kevin Conroy being the voice of Bruce Wayne/Batman, but I was very, very wrong.  Bruce Greenwood was perfect and I have to hope he remains the voice in any future endeavors.  Jensen Ackles was great as Jason Todd and clearly evoked the despair and pain Jason had felt the past five years.  I did not like the voice of Neil Patrick Harris as Dick Grayson/Night Wing.  Too youthful sounding. John DiMaggio as the Joker was stable, I got used to him with every spoken word, but just not up to the level of Mark Hamill.  Hamill's higher pitched voice is better suited for a homicidal character with white skin, green hair, a painted smile and purple clothes. The ending was great and Batman displayed the choice he would have made had he had the chance the first time around.  I read all the comics related to this storyline and what was left in, what was taken out, didn't deter one bit.  I hope a second movie is made to follow up to the conclusion of this story, which leaves us hanging as to the fate of Jason Todd.

1338270,A2LPIJ9DMMXFM4,B003ES5JDS,Lou Pavone,"[0, 0]","From the no holds barred opening scene dissolving to the classy cinematic credits and film score, this was the biggest surprise and the best of all the direct to dvd Warners/DC animated movies to date and packs a major wallop right to the final breathtakingly animated, heart wrenching scenes. Reminiscent of the dark themes, intensity and emotion of the uncensored version of Batman Beyond - Return of the Joker, no coincidence that the unrelentlessly evil and twisted psychopath Joker does very bad things to another Robin in this one too.As they say, you are only as good as your script and this movie gets the balance just right between emotionally charged character motivation to give reason for all the vigilante anger and violence, so the explosive, action packed set pieces doesn't just become 'noise'. We actually give a damn about the characters. For an animated film as opposed to live action, this is more difficult to achieve but that's how good 'Batman: Under The Red Hood' is.Voice acting all round (perfectly cast by Andrea Romano) is pitch perfect with perhaps the exception of Neil Patrick Harris as 'Nightwing' whose tone is more lightweight/cartoonish but then again, his character in this movie is the least angry out of all the characters.What Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' did for raising the bar of live action superhero movies to the next level (how dark and adult can they go?), this movie raises the bar in quality of superhero animated movies. This movie is not suitable for children but made for a wider, more adult audience. Producer Bruce Timm and his team must be relishing the creative freedom that this direct to dvd format gives them (easing censorship restrictions that Television can impose), to be able to have such dark themes in animation get to the final cut.If 'Superman/Batman: Apocalypse', released 28th September can match the quality and intensity of this one, then Warners Animation will continue to set the benchmark standard that other animation studios will try to emulate.",5,Warners/DC animation raise the bar with this one!,1280534400,"07 31, 2010",2010,2031,"['barred', 'opening', 'scene', 'dissolving', 'classy', 'cinematic', 'credits', 'film', 'score', 'was', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'best', 'direct', 'dvd', 'Warners/DC', 'animated', 'movies', 'date', 'major', 'wallop', 'right', 'final', 'breathtakingly', 'animated', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'scenes', 'Reminiscent', 'dark', 'themes', 'intensity', 'emotion', 'uncensored', 'version', 'Batman', 'Beyond', 'Return', 'Joker', 'coincidence', 'unrelentlessly', 'evil', 'twisted', 'psychopath', 'Joker', 'very', 'bad', 'things', 'Robin', 'one', 'too.As', 'say', 'are', 'only', 'as', 'good', 'script', 'movie', 'balance', 'just', 'right', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'character', 'motivation', 'give', 'reason', 'vigilante', 'anger', 'violence', 'explosive', 'action', 'packed', 'set', 'pieces', ""n't"", 'just', 'become', ""'noise"", 'actually', 'give', 'damn', 'characters', 'animated', 'film', 'opposed', 'live', 'action', 'more', 'difficult', 'achieve', 'how', 'good', ""'Batman"", 'Red', 'Hood', 'is.Voice', 'acting', 'round', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Andrea', 'Romano', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'perhaps', 'exception', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', ""'Nightwing"", 'tone', 'more', 'lightweight/cartoonish', 'then', 'again', 'character', 'movie', 'least', 'angry', 'characters.What', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', ""'The"", 'Dark', 'Knight', 'did', 'raising', 'bar', 'live', 'action', 'superhero', 'movies', 'next', 'level', 'how', 'dark', 'adult', 'can', 'go', 'movie', 'bar', 'quality', 'superhero', 'animated', 'movies', 'movie', 'not', 'suitable', 'children', 'made', 'wider', 'more', 'adult', 'audience', 'Producer', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'team', 'must', 'be', 'relishing', 'creative', 'freedom', 'direct', 'dvd', 'format', 'easing', 'censorship', 'restrictions', 'Television', 'can', 'impose', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'such', 'dark', 'themes', 'animation', 'get', 'final', 'cut.If', ""'Superman/Batman"", 'Apocalypse', 'released', '28th', 'September', 'can', 'match', 'quality', 'intensity', 'one', 'then', 'Warners', 'Animation', 'will', 'continue', 'set', 'benchmark', 'standard', 'other', 'animation', 'studios', 'will', 'try', 'emulate']",Batman: Under the Red Hood

Sure enough, the opening cribs from the ""Death In The Family"" comic story, with Joker bashing the Jason Todd Robin up with a crowbar. I won't go into further detail, as comic diehards already know what happens next, but there are plenty of twists and turns in this story I don't want to spoil for the uninitiated.The good: the animation is fluid and extremely well story-boarded. The action doesn't seem to let up for a second, and the voice work overall is really good. Nightwing appears, and they don't bother to bog the story down with explaining who he is. It's good to see Black Mask for once, though he doesn't do much here but chew scenery and punch out his guards.The not so good: this is the same team that brought us the 90's Batman Animated series, but Kevin Conroy and Mark Hammill, the respective voices of Batman and Joker from that series, aren't back here. I can only assume they want to mark this release as a departure for the world of animated Batman (and since they grafted Jason Todd's origin onto Tim Drake aka Robin III in the latter seasons of B:TAS, what happens here already doesn't jive). It's also brutally violent: shootings, beatings, killings, and that's just the Joker. I guess this darker mood was telegraphed back in the ""Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker"" film, but even I wasn't expecting something this out and out violent.

In Batman: The Animated Series (from the early 90's) and the Batman/Superman Adventures, the Joker is given a cartoonish look (even more so in the latter), but here, for an animated movie, the Joker's facial proportions are more real-life, but he still maintains that frightening psycho-clown appearance and demeanor we love so much.Bruce Wayne is given a similar treatment, and I am liking it a LOT. The story itself is very good, and revolves around a character that died a long time ago (in real life for us, not the comic time line) and it was surprising, especially after readers of the comic actually voted for his death. Overall, I can't complain about this film, I really enjoyed it.

1338280,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B003ES5JDS,Mel Odom,"[0, 0]","Everybody who's a DC Comics fan knows the stories of the five Robins that have been with Batman.  First was Dick Grayson, who later became Nightwing.  Second was Jason Todd, who was murdered by the Joker.  Third was Tim Drake, who became Red Robin.  Fourth was Stephanie Brown, who is now Batgirl.  And fifth is Damian, the biological son of Batman/Bruce Wayne.  The stories of these five people are unique and a lot of fun to dig into and discuss with fans.  Everybody has a favorite Robin.Batman:  Under the Red Hood is the story of the second Robin - only after he was killed by the Joker and brought back to life by Ras al-Ghul.  Judd Winick wrote the script, based on the Batman arc he wrote that revived Jason Todd, and it serves pretty well, but I know it couldn't do true justice to the whole story.  There's a lot of history in this tale, and all of it worth telling.As far as this direct-to-DVD effort goes, the story can't relate all the years Jason was around after Batman caught him stealing the tires off the Batmobile (something that fans simply couldn't imagine being done even back in the early 1980s).  He lasted for five years before getting killed, and was dead for seventeen years before he was brought back to life.All the fans believed Jason was dead.  After all, didn't DC Comics run a phone contest for fans to decide his fate?  (Right after that, Warner Brothers - the parent company - got hold of DC and asked what they were going to do with the warehouses full of Batman AND Robin products they had to sell!)  So a third Robin was immediately in the offing.Comic heroes are notorious for not staying dead.  Used to we could point at Captain America's sidekick Bucky Barnes and say, see?  Bucky's dead.  Only now Bucky is the new Captain America and Steve Rogers was dead - except that he's now back alive too.Simply put, there's a lot of emotional context and resonance and real-time history missing from the pared-down story on this disc.  However, it is slam-bag full of all things Batman.  First of all, there's lots and lots of action.  And there's a ton of Bat-toys.  Then there's the appearance of Nightwing, Ra's al-Ghul, AND the Joker.There's a lot going on in this movie.  The beginning of the film is gripping, and the assault on Jason Todd/Robin is brutal.  Watching it with my twelve year old was a little hard because I didn't expect that level of intensity.  The Joker was played as perverse and evil, and he stayed that way through the film.  I love how he turned the tables on Blackmask.The art is rendered beautifully.  Loved the explosive action, the detail, and the cityscape.  The world depicted here really felt like Gotham in all its glory and grime.I found the ending a little disappointing, though.  Plenty of questions were raised, and everybody got a look at the heroes' moral compasses, but the main question concerning Batman's relationship with Jason Todd wasn't satisfactorily answered.  Batman makes a choice at the end, but where does he stand after he makes it?I know part of this story is still ongoing in the DC Universe, so the movie is an excellent lure to pull readers into the six-part Red Hood story now being published.  But in these direct-to-DVD adventures, I'd really appreciate a whole story.  This one ends almost where it starts, and we still don't know the true outcome.This Blu-ray disc comes with lots of extras, including two episodes of the original Batman The Animated Series.  These episodes recount the origin of Dick Grayson/Robin, so they're a special treat.  There's also a lot of material (interviews and comic content) depicting Jason Todd's history.  And there's sneak peek of the next DC Comics direct-to-DVD movie, Superman and Batman:  Apocalypse.  The best part, though, is the Jonah Hex short feature written by Joe R.

1338282,A9RG5IM7LYYVS,B003ES5JDS,"Merlin63 ""Merlin63""","[3, 6]","DC animation admittedly can be VERY uneven. Bruce Timm, as much as I am grateful for his stewardship of most of Batman: The Animated Series, and the Superman animated series can really bite the big one. I'm not a fan of the Doomsday, or even the New Frontier adaptations, and innumerable other projects he's taken on.But here, he knocks the ball out of the park. The animation is first rate! Dark, moody, and with the right kinetic feel to make it seem like a comic book come to life. Like something that could only exist in animation terms.They stick close to the original story (with a few minor variations, which serve the story, as a stand alone, outside of continuity, quite well), and the script is by Judd Winick, so I'm glad for that.The music serves the story very well. The acting, for the most part is first rate (I'm an actor, so please forgive me for nitpicking this part).Bruce Greenwood takes over the role of Batman (look him up on imdb, you know him, yeah you do) from Kevin Conroy, and sounds almost exactly like him! Which is not a bad thing. He does a really great job! Kinda feel bad for Kev, who otherwise is the only guy that should be allowed to play the role, but hey, if he had a sore throat on the day... Bruce did a bang up job!Jenson Ackles (the pretty boy from Supernatural) does a very pretty boy job of playing the the Red Hood. And, ok, I realise he has his fans, but I just don't think he's all that. I think they cast a name, and I think they could have done better. He doesn't suck... but he's helped by a really good script!Neil Patrick Harris plays Nightwing... Not bad, not great, too small a role to be great at. He serves the story well and my only comment is ""when is the next Dr. Horrible coming out!""The Joker, as played by John DiMaggio is frankly week! But he's not in enough of the movie to be a detriment. Still, they should have stuck with Mark Hammil.But for all the nitpicking and whatnot, I gotta say... this is a first rate animated feature, with as much balls as the format will allow.I saw an interview once with Bruce Timm, where he joked that his core audience was a bunch of thirty and forty year old's who still read comics. If that's true, why don't you write and draw for the adult mindset instead of saturday morning cartooning it? Instead of sanitizing it, in other words.This one almost feels like he's playing to that core audience he joked about. It's well worth adding to your animated collection, and even though I've seen ad advance copy of it, I can't wait to add the 2 disc version to my collection ('cause I'm a geek and I like all those bs features and documentaries that come with them).If you want, wait 'till the price goes down (it's a tough economy we're stuck in) but put on your wanted list, it's worth the wait!",5,Wow!

1338291,A38K01P0FW7ZL4,B003ES5JDS,Ming Ciao,"[1, 1]","This is easily the most effective, engaging animated DC flick I've seen. From the animation, to the art, to the voice cast, and the ability to weave the best parts from the cinematic Batman universe into this crime drama. It is absolute class, and bests anything before it. Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge fan of the original animated series. But due to the direct-to-DVD release, and rating -- creative liberties were given that were not afforded to the animated series. It could easily be a companion piece to The Dark Knight.Batman is not Superman. He needs to flirt with crime drama, psychological thrillers, and film noir. That is quintessential Batman, in my opinion. When his comic book gimmickry is downplayed, and you can treat him as though he were a police detective, as opposed to a dude flying around in a bat suit. It's almost as if all that (cars, weapons, costume) becomes window dressing, or a facade to lure kids to throw down money as opposed to the real crux of the character who is Bruce Wayne.Many things in this film are treated with care, and respect. More so than other Batman fare. And maybe it's my naivety in regards to the comics this is based on, but ""AMAZO"" is the only flaw. After the film does a killer job at setting a somber, Batman-esque tone -- AMAZO happens. A ridiculous, cybernetic, super solider is thrown way out of left field to attack Batman, and Nightwing.Imagine you're watching a show like ""The Sopranos"", and after a great bit of storytelling, and setting the ""rules"" of the show -- you're comfortable with the tone. Then WHAM, Tony Soprano gets hit by a lead pipe, and he is face-to-face with no one other than Swamp Thing who wants his crib back. But Tony, and his family are turning his mossy home into a waterfront cantina for drunken tourists that moonlights as a money-laundering scheme.Doesn't make any sense, does it? The Batman universe is definitely broad, and has many supernatural elements (including the Pit featured here.) But does this particular film, focusing on the crime-driven narrative, and ideological battle between the Red Hood, and Batman really prosper from the robot with the elfin shoes? It's distracting.But no matter, AMAZO's done in like 3 minutes, and you have the rest of the film to enjoy the incredible cast, art, animation, score, and storytelling that sets this apart from any other DC animated film.

The last solo Batman film in this line-up was Batman Gotham Knight. I found that movie to be a disappointment, however, this film made up for it. I did not care for this film when I first watched it. However, when I viewed it again I loved it. This is definitely better than Gotham Knight. I even like this more than the Dark Knight Returns films. In fact this is probably the best film in the DC animated line-up so far.Under the Red Hood is based on the comic of the same name. Under the Red Hood begins with the death of Jason Todd at the hands of the Joker. Then it cuts to years later. This new villain called the Red Hood shows up in Gotham in an attempt to control crime in Gotham. Batman needs to confront this new villain and face up to his past with Jason.This film briefly covers Death in the Family and covers Under the Red Hood. The writer of the comic, Under the Red Hood is one of the people working on this film. I'm not familiar with the Red Hood comic. From what I hear it was not the best. Many people say that this is the definitive take on the Red Hood. From seeing this movie I can see why they think that. The writer of the original comic was involved because he wanted to make the story better, and many thought he succeeded. It is great to see someone get the opportunity to improve upon his work.The voice-acting took some getting used to. I'm so used to Kevin Conroy voicing Batman, that this new voice did not immediately sit right with me. However, seeing the film again I like the voice actor of Batman. Bruce Greenwood voiced Batman in this movie as well as Young Justice. He does a good job as Batman.Jensen Ackles, who voices Red Hood does a great job as well. I'm a fan of Jensen from the series Supernatural. The man has a wide range of acting talent. I wish he would get more work. Neil Patrick Harris does a decent job as Nightwing. Wade Williams as Black Mask was a lot of fun to watch.However, John DiMaggio is probably one of my least favorite Jokers. He is definitely not up-to-par with Mark Hamill or Heath Ledger. I even like Jack Nicolson's Joker more. DiMaggio just did not sit right with me. I did not care for his voice, and I did not think he had any presence to him.The animation is great, besides a few CGI shots. The action is great and engaging. Although, one action scene with a certain villain, I felt, was out of place in this kind of movie.Overall this is a great Batman movie.

1338295,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B003ES5JDS,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[3, 6]","Warning: spoilers ahead...Adapting his own much maligned comic storyline while writing Batman, Judd Winick's Batman: Under the Red Hood is the latest in the DC/Warner Bros. line of direct-to-video animated features.  Combining the controversial 80s storyline ""A Death in the Family"" with his own ""Under the Hood"" (along with a great nod to Alan Moore's classic ""The Killing Joke"", Winick weaves a tale involving a guilt-ridden Batman (voiced by Bruce Greenwood) who, years after the death of Jason Todd, the second Robin, at the hands of the Joker (voiced by John Di Maggio), finds himself at odds with the vigilante Red Hood (voiced by Supernatural's Jensen Ackles).  Red Hood appears to be carving a deadly path through Gotham City's criminal underworld ruled by Black Mask (voiced by Prison Break's Wade Williams) while at the same time hiding his own agenda with Batman; all of which leads up to the inevitable showdown and revelation.  For those unfamiliar with the comic storyline, Jason Todd was brought back from the dead after years of being one of those ""untouchable"" dead characters in comics (much like Bucky (who also came back from the dead in Captain America around the same time, Gwen Stacy, or Uncle Ben), who meant more in death than they ever did in life.  Winick's storyline wasn't quite praised at the time, although it does seem to fit better here as an animated feature.  That being said, even those who are unfamiliar with Batman comic continuity won't have much trouble figuring out Red Hood's identity.  The animation itself is sharp, some of the voices are well cast, and the feature as a whole is surprisingly quite violent.  With all that being said, the dialogue doesn't quite hold up well, Nightwing (voiced by Neil Patrick Harris) comes off as a laughable character, and compared to the past DC Universe features, Under the Red Hood just isn't as enthralling.  Still though, it's worth a look at the very least, and goes down much smoother than Winick's comic storyarc ever did.",3,"Not bad, but leaves something to be desired",1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,2010,"['Warning', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'Adapting', 'own', 'much', 'maligned', 'comic', 'storyline', 'writing', 'Batman', 'Judd', 'Winick', 'Batman', 'Red', 'Hood', 'latest', 'DC/Warner', 'Bros.', 'line', 'direct-to-video', 'animated', 'features', 'Combining', 'controversial', '80s', 'storyline', 'Death', 'Family', 'own', 'Hood', 'great', 'nod', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'classic', 'Killing', 'Joke', 'Winick', 'tale', 'involving', 'guilt-ridden', 'Batman', 'voiced', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'who', 'years', 'death', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'second', 'Robin', 'hands', 'Joker', 'voiced', 'John', 'Di', 'Maggio', 'odds', 'vigilante', 'Red', 'Hood', 'voiced', 'Supernatural', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'Red', 'Hood', 'be', 'carving', 'deadly', 'path', 'Gotham', 'City', 'criminal', 'underworld', 'ruled', 'Black', 'Mask', 'voiced', 'Prison', 'Break', 'Wade', 'Williams', 'same', 'time', 'hiding', 'own', 'agenda', 'Batman', 'inevitable', 'showdown', 'revelation', 'unfamiliar', 'comic', 'storyline', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'dead', 'years', 'being', 'one', 'untouchable', 'dead', 'characters', 'comics', 'much', 'Bucky', 'who', 'also', 'came', 'back', 'dead', 'Captain', 'America', 'same', 'time', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'who', 'meant', 'more', 'death', 'ever', 'did', 'life', 'Winick', 'storyline', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'praised', 'time', 'seem', 'fit', 'better', 'here', 'animated', 'feature', 'being', 'said', 'even', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'Batman', 'comic', 'continuity', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'trouble', 'figuring', 'out', 'Red', 'Hood', 'identity', 'animation', 'sharp', 'voices', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'feature', 'whole', 'surprisingly', 'quite', 'violent', 'being', 'said', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'Nightwing', 'voiced', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'off', 'laughable', 'character', 'compared', 'past', 'DC', 'Universe', 'features', 'Red', 'Hood', 'just', ""n't"", 'enthralling', 'Still', 'look', 'very', 'least', 'down', 'much', 'smoother', 'Winick', 'comic', 'storyarc', 'ever', 'did']",Batman: Under the Red Hood

1338297,AZXFS8GCTSQ5R,B003ES5JDS,NF,"[1, 2]","This is one of the more graphic and disturbing movies put out by the Warner Brothers animation studio. Please do take the movie rating seriously and screen this for yourself before letting a younger child watch it.The movie opens with a desperate Batman racing to rescue Jason Todd, Robin, who has been captured by the Joker. The Joker has taken Jason to a remote location (Sarajevo), savagely beaten him, and then left him for dead with a ticking timebomb. Batman arrives just as the bomb explodes and, after frantically searching through the rubble, in a moving and iconic image that is straight from the original comic book story, holds a limp Jason in his arms.The movie jumps forward five years, as we're introduced to the title figure, who is threatening a meeting of the largest drug dealers in Gotham, telling them that for 40% of their profits, he will protect them from Batman and from a would-be crime kingpin who has been taking over the gangs of Gotham, the Black Mask. To show them what he can do, he throws a duffel bag on the table, a bag containing the heads of their top lieutenants.We then switch to the other main protagonist of this movie, as Batman intercepts a gang of hoodlums who have hijacked a shipment. The truck crashes and the shipment, the super-power-absorbing android, Amazo, is freed. With some assistance from Nightwing, the threat is defused. Batman interrogates the thieves and finds out that they are working for the Red Hood and that the shipment was intended for the Black Mask. Before he can learn more, the three men are all killed by sniper fire. Batman takes off in pursuit of the sniper and tracks him down to the factory where he first met the man known as the Red Hood (from a very old Batman story). This new Red Hood blows up the factory, effecting his escape.Finally, we are introduced to the last member of our cast of characters: the Black Mask, the crime boss whom the Red Hood appears to be personally targeting. His crew is making arrangements for an arms shipment while the boss gripes about how the Red Hood is eating into his organization. Unfortunately for the Mask, we see that both Batman and the Red Hood are listening in.The Red Hood steals the shipment but is stopped by Batman and Nightwing. The resulting chase sequence is innovative and thrilling, with some very clever work on the part of the Red Hood to get away. The Red Hood taunts the pair as a train passes by, masking his final comment. Later, at the Batcave, Batman filters the train sound out to hear that what the Red Hood actually said was, ""You haven't lost your touch, Bruce!""We then flash back to Batman and a very young Jason Todd as Robin taking on the Riddler, followed by a seamless transition to an older Robin taking on, and brutally beating, a gang of thieves. An angry Batman dresses down an unapologetic Jason, who insists that the crooks deserved what they got.Back in the present day, the violence between the Black Mask and the Red Hood escalates, with each of them attacking the other's businesses and underlings. The Black Mask sends some of the best super-powered assassins in the business to take out the Red Hood, a trap that he evades with the assistance of Batman. Finally, the Black Mask gets desperate and he seeks some very special help, help that ultimately backfires on him. To reveal any more would be to give away too much of the plot. Suffice to say that there are some surprises and interesting plot twists ahead. And that the story behind who the Red Hood really is and how he came to be is thought-provoking. My only complaint is that the ending is a bit unsatisfying, with part of it unbelievable and the rest of it ambiguous. There is no nice clean resolution here.I give the story top marks on this one. The Red Hood is someone that Batman could easily have become if he had allowed himself to cross that line. The dilemma about what should happen to psychopathic criminals like the Joker is a very real issue, something the Batman, and every hero, faces every day. How many people has the Joker killed? How many times has he escaped? Wouldn't it really be better if Batman were to simply have killed him on their first meeting? But if Batman crosses that line, what would he become? Is it really appropriate for someone like Batman to be judge and jury? To become a killer, even if it's in a good cause?The animation is excellent, with some very good sequences and an appropriate dark and brooding look that fits well with the movie's mood. Occasionally, the CGI sequences were a bit too obvious and didn't blend seamlessly in with the hand-drawn animation but not so much that it takes you out of the story. I had only one objection: they gave the Joker more of a craggy look with high cheekbones that didn't really match the look I've grown accustomed to.The voice acting is a mixed bag. I thought Bruce Greenwood did a good job as Batman, while Neil Patrick Harris was a surprisingly effective Nightwing. The supporting characters were also fine The two voices I had trouble with were, unfortunately, two of the critical voices for the movie. Jensen Ackles, as Red Hood, just didn't do it for me. It wasn't a terrible job but it sounded like he was overdoing it, forcing his voice so as to try to sound tougher. And John DiMaggio as the Joker really bothered me. I'm not going to claim that Mark Hamill is the only one who can be the voice of the Joker but John just didn't pull it off, in my opinion.Overall, I found this to be a disturbing and thought-provoking movie, one clearly aimed at adults and older youths rather than young kids. The action sequences were superb, the story engrossing, the animation excellent. I have to quibble about a couple of the voice actor choices and the ending but even with that the movie is still a solid 4, perhaps even 4.5, stars and I can definitely recommend it.",4,Darkly

1338298,A2CGEI95LY2R4G,B003ES5JDS,Nicole,"[0, 0]","This is one of my all-time favorite movies featuring Jason Todd. Not many characters unless popular such as the Batman or Superman have a movie. This one was pretty good for me who read the Death in the Family. I was hesitant to watch it but I did. It was amazing. I enjoyed the voice of Jason (Supernatural); the character was done well and I like the script. In my opinion it was done well. However do consider this movie is 75 minutes, this means that it is rushed. Overall it is a good movie.The disks are better for me because I enjoy the Robins.Disc one contains the move and trailers to the other DC movies.Disc Two was good and disappointing. It featured Robin: The Story of DIck Grayson which explores the origin and evolution of the character. I happen to enjoy all the Robins but the problem was this movie is about Jason Todd who took over as Robin. The movie only gave you a small history of Jason Todd from his death to upcoming role as THe Red Hood. It also contains two Batman Animated Series episodes which feature Richard Dick Grayson.The main reason I bought this is because I love the movie and it's the only animation featuring Jason Todd besides a cameo. Jason's background and history is probably one of the most tragic within the DC nation. All the Robins (Male) have been featured within the history of DC animation. Jason's had only  one other appearance which once a cameo in Young Justice. and it was not even for a full minute.I've had this movie for a few days but I'm enjoying it and most likely I will probably watch this every week before DC nation or after.",5,Jason Todd: The Forgotten Robin,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,1591,"['one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'featuring', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'Not', 'many', 'characters', 'popular', 'such', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'have', 'movie', 'one', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'who', 'read', 'Death', 'Family', 'was', 'hesitant', 'watch', 'did', 'was', 'amazing', 'enjoyed', 'voice', 'Jason', 'Supernatural', 'character', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'like', 'script', 'opinion', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'However', 'do', 'consider', 'movie', '75', 'minutes', 'rushed', 'Overall', 'good', 'movie.The', 'disks', 'are', 'better', 'enjoy', 'Robins.Disc', 'one', 'move', 'trailers', 'other', 'DC', 'movies.Disc', 'Two', 'was', 'good', 'disappointing', 'featured', 'Robin', 'Story', 'DIck', 'Grayson', 'origin', 'evolution', 'character', 'happen', 'enjoy', 'Robins', 'problem', 'was', 'movie', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'who', 'took', 'over', 'Robin', 'movie', 'only', 'gave', 'small', 'history', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'death', 'upcoming', 'role', 'THe', 'Red', 'Hood', 'also', 'two', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'feature', 'Richard', 'Dick', 'Grayson.The', 'main', 'reason', 'bought', 'love', 'movie', 'only', 'animation', 'featuring', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'cameo', 'Jason', 'background', 'history', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'tragic', 'DC', 'nation', 'Robins', 'Male', 'have', 'been', 'featured', 'history', 'DC', 'animation', 'Jason', 'had', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'appearance', 'once', 'cameo', 'Young', 'Justice', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'full', 'minute.I', ""'ve"", 'had', 'movie', 'few', 'days', ""'m"", 'enjoying', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'probably', 'watch', 'week', 'DC', 'nation']",Batman: Under the Red Hood
1338299,A374N6FTIT1A7N,B003ES5JDS,Niugui Cilantron,"[0, 0]","First, some background information.  Batman has had four Robins over the years.  The first Robin, Dick Grayson, leaves Batman and later changes his crime-fighting name to Nightwing (with a new costume).  The second Robin was Jason Todd, who, well, you'll learn all about him from the movie (or from the other reviews.  Hey, just because all the other guys have spoilers doesn't mean I have to.)  Also, the Joker has had some slightly different origin stories over the years.  In some of the versions, he began his career as ""Red Hood,""  wearing a red metallic helmet which completely covers his face.  He was wearing this hood when he fell into the chemical vat which changed his skin and hair color, so Batman never knew who he really was.The film begins with the Joker clobbering the Jason Todd Robin with a crowbar.  You don't actually see the crowbar hit Robin's head, nevertheless, this is a good reason for the movie to be rated PG-13, and you probably wouldn't want your younger kids to watch it.  Then a bomb goes off, and, um, we're in the present day of the film (many years later).  There's a new villain in town calling himself the Red Hood.  The major crime boss in Gotham is the Black Mask, and the Red Hood wants to take over his territory, apparently.  But that's not what's really going on...I'm not a Batman expert, and I haven't read the original comics the movie was based on, but this story seems self-contained and you don't really need any more background information than what I gave you above for the story to make sense.  The animation is pretty good (better in some places than in others, as is typical).  Regarding the voice actors, I think John Dimaggio does a great job as the Joker.  He steals every scene he's in (plus he gets most of the best lines).  Jensen Ackles does a good job as Red Hood.  Bruce Greenwood is adequate as Batman, and Neil Patrick Harris adds humor to Nightwing.  (I get this vibe that Batman wishes Nightwing would just go away, which makes their scenes together amusing.)I have two problems with the movie that keeps it from being a five star.  First, the Black Mask character just isn't very interesting.  Second, and more important, **slight spoiler** when Red Hood asks Batman The Big Philosophical Question towards the end of the movie, Batman's answer just doesn't quite work.  **end spoiler**For special features, there are trailers for Superman/Batman Apocalypse, Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, Batman: Gotham Knight, Superman: Doomsday, The Lord of the Rings (Animated), the Jonah Hex motion comic, and Legend of the Guardians.",4,Pretty good,1327708800,"01 28, 2012",2012,2598,"['First', 'background', 'information', 'Batman', 'had', 'four', 'Robins', 'years', 'first', 'Robin', 'Dick', 'Grayson', 'Batman', 'later', 'changes', 'crime-fighting', 'name', 'Nightwing', 'new', 'costume', 'second', 'Robin', 'was', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'who', 'well', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'movie', 'other', 'reviews', 'Hey', 'just', 'other', 'guys', 'have', 'spoilers', ""n't"", 'mean', 'have', 'Also', 'Joker', 'had', 'slightly', 'different', 'origin', 'stories', 'years', 'versions', 'began', 'career', 'Red', 'Hood', 'wearing', 'red', 'metallic', 'helmet', 'completely', 'face', 'was', 'wearing', 'hood', 'when', 'fell', 'chemical', 'vat', 'changed', 'skin', 'hair', 'color', 'Batman', 'never', 'knew', 'who', 'really', 'was.The', 'film', 'begins', 'Joker', 'clobbering', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'Robin', 'crowbar', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'see', 'crowbar', 'hit', 'Robin', 'head', 'nevertheless', 'good', 'reason', 'movie', 'be', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'younger', 'kids', 'watch', 'Then', 'bomb', 'off', 'um', ""'re"", 'present', 'day', 'film', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'new', 'villain', 'town', 'calling', 'Red', 'Hood', 'major', 'crime', 'boss', 'Gotham', 'Black', 'Mask', 'Red', 'Hood', 'take', 'over', 'territory', 'apparently', 'not', 'what', 'really', 'going', ""'m"", 'not', 'Batman', 'expert', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'original', 'comics', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'story', 'self-contained', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'more', 'background', 'information', 'what', 'gave', 'story', 'make', 'sense', 'animation', 'pretty', 'good', 'better', 'places', 'others', 'typical', 'Regarding', 'voice', 'actors', 'think', 'John', 'Dimaggio', 'great', 'job', 'Joker', 'scene', 'most', 'best', 'lines', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'good', 'job', 'Red', 'Hood', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'adequate', 'Batman', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'humor', 'Nightwing', 'get', 'vibe', 'Batman', 'Nightwing', 'would', 'just', 'go', 'away', 'scenes', 'together', 'amusing', 'have', 'two', 'problems', 'movie', 'being', 'five', 'star', 'First', 'Black', 'Mask', 'character', 'just', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting', 'Second', 'more', 'important', '**slight', 'spoiler**', 'when', 'Red', 'Hood', 'Batman', 'Big', 'Philosophical', 'Question', 'end', 'movie', 'Batman', 'answer', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', '**end', 'spoiler**For', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'trailers', 'Superman/Batman', 'Apocalypse', 'Justice', 'League', 'Crisis', 'Two', 'Earths', 'Batman', 'Gotham', 'Knight', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Animated', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'motion', 'comic', 'Legend', 'Guardians']",Batman: Under the Red Hood

Bruce Greenwood was excellent as Batman and the rest of the cast was also great.The animation was really amazing.  Some of the scenes of Gotham City looked pretty realistic.  This movie was much darker than any of the Batman movies to date.  I definitely noticed that there was much more violence than what I'm used to seeing in W.B.'s animation.  Most of the really ""bad"" things were done off camera but there was a lot of gunfire, beatings, blood, and killing.  Not to say that those things are not appropriate, because they certainly are, but parents may want to preview this film before allowing younger children to watch it.Given the storyline of Jason Todd's Robin/Red Hood, the violence is not surprising.  There are appearances by Nightwing, Alfred, Ra's al Ghul, the Joker, the Black Mask, and various other Gotham criminals.I was disappointed in the special features.

Garrard ""the G-man""","[0, 2]","Warner Brothers Animation is continuing with its quality direct-to-DVD films that take established comic stories that are fairly true to their origins, albeit abbreviated and somewhat altered.  This latest release sports superb animation, an engaging storyline, and fine voiceover work for a gifted cast.Bruce Greenwood, though not Kevin Conroy, makes a good Batman/Bruce Wayne.  Those of us who prefer Conroy in the role, can be satisfied with Greenwood's interpretation.Jensen Ackles, star of ""Supernatural,"" is excellent as the enigmatic Red Hood and Wade Williams fares very well in the role of The Black Mask.  Neil Patrick Harris makes a great Nightwing/Dick Grayson.However, John Dimaggio is OK as The Joker but the film would benefit the inclusion of Mark Hamill in the part.  His is the definitive voice while Dimaggio comes off a little bit too Heath-Ledger-like.David Warner should also have been a participant in the film as Ra's Al Ghul.  Jason Isaac's just doesn't have Warner's distinctive menace.  And if 92-year-old Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. hasn't retired, then his should have been the voice of Alfred as in did in the Batman animated series and subsequent movies and television follow-ups.The PG-13 rating for the film is warranted for the violent content and the occasional profanity; thus, for the parents who may not pay attention to the rating, the DVD should come with a more attention-grabbing disclaimer so that unsuspecting parents won't pop it in, thinking that they'ew getting a more ""family-friendly"" ""SuperFriends"" installment.""Batman: Under the Red Hood"" is definitely not that.As far as the extras go, the best of these is ""Robin: The Story of Dick Grayson,"" a well-produced mini-documentary on the evolution of the character.

1338310,A3L3OKIPMLGAUK,B003ES5JDS,Ricardo C.,"[7, 24]","Batman: Under The Hood, written by Judd Winick, reincarnates former Robin, Jason Todd, as a homicidal vigilante. Though the permise was gimmicky from it's conception, (an obvious ploy commisioned by DC to get people to buy into their ultra-convoluted ""crisis on infinite earths"" story arc) Winick wrote a sharp witted story-arc with humor and some psychological depth. This was all lost in the dismal animated adaptation. Batman: Under The Red Hood undermines pretty much everything Winick did in the comic book counterpart. Jason is sorely underdeveloped; All we know about him is he was a cocky kid who once wore green tights as Batman's former side-kick. His years spent with Batman are simply set-up in quick excerpts. Jason's bitterness is aparent but it's superficial at best. I think the film's secound biggest crime was the absence of good humor. Judd Winick is primarily a cartoonist so funny dialogue isn't foriegn to him and the witty banter he wrote for Black Mask and Todd was entirely eliminated for the animated film. As a matter of fact, the only reason why I read this story more than once was mostly because of the humorous dialogue. One of my favorite lines was the following:Joker (talking to Jason): Didn't I kill you ?Jason: You said that already.Joker: I know, I just like to keep saying it.In general, the humor fell flat in this film. Many of the one-liners felt like poor TV sit-com garbage, mostly coming from the painfully flat Nightwing. Last the plot was just done so poorly. Most of this film is just fighting, the initimate moments of the original comic book story-arc were brushed aside such as Todd taunting Joker because he knows he isn't as crazy as he thought he was and dimissing Black Mask (who looks like a low-rent pimp in this movie) as just another thug with a gimmick. The biggest plot hole had to be Jason's plan to free the Joker from Arkham Asylum. How would Jason know Black Mask would recruit the Joker to stop him ? In the comic it made sense, Jason found the Joker and just kidnapped him. Why even place him Arkham at the time ?I think I could probably go into another long and seperate rant about the flacid backgrounds and character designs and futility of being ""reaslitic"" in animation. However I'll just say that DC is better off making story-arcs like this into live-action films. You don't have to go on the scale of features but something DTV so you won't have to cut so much out in an animated adaptation. Lastly Warners can afford a stable of talented voice actors that are a lot cheaper then boring live action stars.

1338313,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B003ES5JDS,RJ Smoove,"[3, 3]","I want to start off by saying that my all time favorite film is The Dark Knight. That said, this movie takes the Gotham Nolan created and brings it to its animated roots. All the way down to the train that Batman fought Ras Al Ghul on, in Batman Begins. Now for the movie at hand, Under The Red Hood is a great addition to the collection of animated comic book films. The dark, gothic presentation is perfect. The pacing is perfect as well. This one is a bit longer than usual. It's still only an hour and fifteen minutes, but I thought it was perfectly paced, and ended when it should. Under The Red Hood is more mature, and that's what we want when it comes to Batman. Superman can be childish, but Batman is supposed to be mature. This movie reminded me of Marvel a few times. First of all, the Red Hood himself looks a lot like Deadpool (my favorite comic book character). He also reminded me of Daredevil when he and Batman faced off on the roof of a church.There was another villain in the movie by the name of Black Mask. He looked exactly like Red Skull from Captain America comics, except his face was black. And he ran the crime in Gotham like the Kingpin runs Hell's Kitchen in Daredevil comics. There was also a brief fight between Batman, Nightwing and a Superman-like android called Amazo, who happened to do the Hulk Smash. He was also very much like the Terminator. He rises out of fire with half of his metal face exposed and a bright red eye. All of the times they did something like that, which had already been done, I considered it homage. There are some nice winks to other sci-fi flicks. in a positive light. So, there's another Marvel reminder.The action was great. It was a bit over the top and unrealistic, but it's a cartoon. Why not do things that couldn't be done in live action? They really took me out of it though, because there were a bunch of explosions (some of which the characters were actually inside the exploding building), yet no one seemed to get hurt by them. A few scratches on the face aren't good enough. I'd expect dismemberment from the kinds of punishment the characters went through in this movie. Of course, it is a kid's movie at heart, so they can push limits, but not too far. There is a bit of mild profanity, so I wonder who the target audience is. I'd think it would be older fans, like myself. But the mix of mature subject matter and violence with unrealistic physics and explosion damage is a bit immature.Either way, the negatives really brought the quality of the overall film down. If it were not for the unrealistic explosion damage and people jumping from buildings across the street (like Marvel's live action adaptation of Daredevil), I would have given it a 5/5. That's how much it took me out of the movie. I'm ranting, but the positives far outweigh the negatives. The writing is actually very good. There was a good amount of humor, even though some of the more juvenile jokes fell flat. Also, the fantastic mystery aspect of most Batman movies (he is the world's best detective) didn't last very long. We find out who the Red Hood is way too early, but hey. It's not a long movie anyway. I also think fans will be satisfied by the long list of characters who make an appearance.The Joker, the Red Hood, the Riddler, Ras Al Ghul, the Fearsome Hand of Four, Amazo and Black Mask are all of the villains that make an appearance. Don't worry though, they are balanced perfectly. Batman, Robin and Nightwing are the heroes that make an appearance. Of course, what is a Batman movie without Alfred? He's in it too. I loved the connection to the Gotham that Chris Nolan created. There were a few scenes very reminiscent of scenes in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. If you've seen those two movies as many times as I have, then you should spot them right away. If not, then oh well. The score was another aspect that was directly linked to Nolan's. The music in this movie was very much like the music in The Dark Knight. Some of the musical themes were identical. So, all in all, I really liked this one. I got the blu ray, but just noticed that my review is for the dvd. Anyway, the blu ray is perfect. Lots of worthwhile features, amazing video and audio.

1338314,AJ4TG9LNSB0Y4,B003ES5JDS,"Robert M. ""Professional Nerd""","[1, 1]","I just took a look at the 2010 DC animated film, Batman: Under the Red Hood, to see if it still held water after a few years, and stands with the rest of the DC animated film line. I must say, I think it still holds up pretty good.Most of why this film works is because of the creative team. It was directed by Brandon Vietti. He has done a lot of Batman work, including Young Justice, The Batman, and Batman: The Brave and the Bold, but sadly, not on the original and perfect Batman: The Animated Series. Moreover, the screenplay was written by Judd Winick, who also wrote the comic book storyline that this film is based on, called Batman: Under the Hood, which ran in the Batman series back in 2005. So we know that the creative team has considerable experience dealing with the Dark Knight, so we should get a pretty faithful adaptation here, and we do. Years after the death of his sidekick, Jason Todd a.k.a. Robin, Batman is still battling underworld crime in Gotham City, which is run by the mob boss Black Mask. However, things get shaken up when a new upstart who has taken the mantle of the Red Hood starts taking territory and influence away from Black mask. Things get personal for Batman, when it appears that the Red Hood may in fact be Jason Todd, back from the dead. To make matters worse, Black Mask hires the Joker to help them take care of both the Dark Knight and the Red Hood. And it all comes down to a fateful showdown between the bat, the clown, and the boy.The animation and art direction for this film is again, pretty good. Like most of these DC animated films, the art style is pretty similar to what we are ready got in the DCAU, but just different enough to tell that this isn't the same universe and were getting a different story. The action throughout this film is very good. I can tell what's going on and who's fighting who. In particular, I was very impressed with some of the acrobatic animation that went along with the Nightwing and Jason Todd characters. The original animated series could never get away with animation that was that crisp and that fluid, but they pull it off in this film very well, mostly because it's got a much larger budget. There are some very good shots of Gotham city in this film, and I get a much better sense of how large and bustling this city is, and there is also some fairly decent CGI with the vehicles, including the Batplane. There are a few flashback scenes that hearken to an earlier time of comic books. The design and colors here look more akin to what we would've seen in the Silver Age of the 1960s, sort of like the old Adam West series. The henchmen have their own outfits that follow their still in boss's gimmick, and the Dynamic Duo have their earlier, more colorful costumes from that era. However, there are a few hiccups in the overall art design. I'll say that Bruce Wayne looks kind of odd without the Bat cowl on; his hair looks like some sort of Army sergeant's crew cut, which I have never pictured Bruce with. The opening credits leave much to be desired, as they look like what is real-life video with some grainy Photoshop filters over it, which isn't as good as it sounds. The end credits are also similar to this, but with only one continuous shot of rain falling on a city street. For a very interesting movie, it's got very un-interesting bookends.The characters and their voice actors are very well done in this film, for the most part. This film sets a pretty good tone right off the bat, with a pretty intense and gruesome opening scene of the Joker beating the second Robin, Jason Todd, with a crowbar. Right away, this film establishes that it is dark and gritty, even more so than the animated series (which, in case you didn't know, this film is not in continuity with). However, Jason is portrayed here in a way that shows that he is not helpless or without dignity. Later, there is a very good introduction for his new persona, the newest Red Hood, which immediately establishes that he is skilled, and a threat to both the criminals in Gotham City and a physical match for Batman. A lot of what makes Jason Todd so good comes from his voice actor, Jensen Ackles, who does fantastic. He perfectly delivers the seriousness of what's happened to the character, as well as his cockiness and sense of humor. Also, in the flashbacks were he's a teenager, Vincent Martella (whom you will probably most recognize as the voice of Phineas from Phineas and Ferb, and Greg, young Chris Rock's only white friend from Everybody Hates Chris) performs decently as the angsty teen Robin. However, was far more impressed by the performance of his younger brother, Alexander, as the very young Jason Todd, who was able to get across the characters joy and excitement about his new life as a superhero sidekick. One of the best performances in this film is from the legend-(wait for it)-dary Neil Patrick Harris, who takes over the role of Dick Grayson/Nightwing, who was also the first Robin. I get a real sense of Dick's lighthearted attitude, which contrasts well with Batman's more sullen disposition. I'd say this was a case of perfect casting. Bruce Wayne's trusted butler, Alfred, is also good. I will admit that his voice actor caught me off guard for a second; he sounds almost just like the original. In fact, I had to look it up. It's not the original, Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., but rather Jim Piddock, who does very good, as evidenced by my initial confusion. Also appearing as a side character in this film is one of Batman's greatest enemies, Ra's al Ghul, voiced here by the great Jason Isaacs, who does phenomenally well. Isaacs displays all of the qualities that I've come to expect from the Demon's Head; he is cool, calm, elegant, not without honor, and believably remorseful in this story. Isaacs' British accent is back in full force here and it works well with Ra's al Ghul, conveying his class and aristocratic demeanor. However, not every performance was a home run, in my opinion. Wade Williams did fairly well as Black Mask in trying to convey what they wanted the character to be like in this film. However, I think the problem is their approach, not particularly Williams' performance. Here, Black Mask seems more like an angry gangster akin to Tony Montana than an in-control crime lord. He comes across as a petulant child, in my opinion. However I did very much like his assistant, Ms. Li, voiced by Kelly Hu, as a levelheaded aide who doesn't bat an eye at her boss's tantrum-like behavior. Also the android Amazo makes a brief appearance towards the beginning, although I can't explain why he looks like a buff Namor the Sub-Mariner here, but is appearance does get cooler as he sustains battle damage, giving off a very Terminator-esque vibe.In the end though, what the acting comes down to are the performances of main hero, Batman, and the main villain, the Joker. And here, both do . . . okay, but not great. I'm probably being too critical here, because in my mind, both actors are matched up to previous performances that are near impossible to top. So, you could say that it's unfair to judge them as bad, only because they're up against an insurmountable wall. Bruce Greenwood (whom you know as Captain Christopher Pike from the new J.J. Abrams-directed Star Trek films) does objectively pretty good as Batman. But like I just said, he's not as perfect as Kevin Conroy was, but he is good at his own right. Greenwood can convey the repressed emotion of Batman, but not the same of authority and power that Conroy could pull off, both as Bruce Wayne and as the Dark Knight. Overall, Greenwood did well enough for this film, and he would later go on to reprise his role as Batman in the Young Justice series. My critique of the Joker's performance is pretty much the same. Here, the Clown Prince of Crime is voiced by none other than John DiMaggio, a veteran voice actor whom you have heard before as Dr. Drakken from Kim Possible, Jake from Adventure Time, and Bender from Futurama (throughout most of this film, I half expected the Joker to tell Batman to bite his shiny metal ass). Here, he does pretty good as the Joker, but again, doesn't give us the same perfection that Mark Hamill could do. However, he still does objectively very well. We get all of the good characteristics of the Joker that we've seen before; DiMaggio delivers very well the character's dark humor, irreverence, sadism, and madness, far better than some other recent voices for the Joker that I've heard. I'd say that as the voice of the Joker, John DiMaggio places as a solid second-best. Again, my opinion of these two performances is marred by the fact that I grew up with the original animated series, which remains in my mind as one of the best interpretations of these characters ever done, which is a hard standard to live up to.The climax for this film is very well done. It is intense, suspenseful, has great action, and very good use of the characters' gadgets. It comes down to Jason, the Joker, and Batman in an interesting variant of a Mexican standoff. What makes this climax so good is that it contains a great discussion of the ethics and reasoning of Batman. You really get a feel of how Batman thinks and how that plays into his actions and how he deals with his enemies. Contrast this with the ethics of Superman, which are also very good, but very different, which plays into the differences of these characters but also allows for both of their greatness. Overall, this was a very good film. It had a compact story that was complex but not too difficult to follow. We got great performances from most of the actors, and there was a great ethical discussion at the end. This is a very good entry in not just animated Batman films, but Batman films in general.The DVD extras here are pretty good. There the standard sneak peeks and trailers, and so forth. There are two pretty good documentaries about each of the robins featured in this film: Dick Grayson and Jason Todd. These documentaries highlight the histories of each character, and gives good insight on their similarities and differences and what made each character good in his own right. Also included standard with these DC animated films are a few episodes of the original Batman: The Animated Series, which on this disc are some of the best episodes from the entire series run, including Robin's Reckoning, the fantastic Mad Love, and the interesting The Laughing Fish. As per some of the recent entries in the DC animated films line, this one also includes as a bonus feature a short film, Jonah Hex. Don't worry; it has nothing to do with the live-action Josh Brolin film and this one is actually pretty good. It was directed by Joaquim Dos Santos and music by The Track Team, some of the guys behind the Avatar animated series and some episodes of Justice League Unlimited. There's good art design here, even better than the DCAU's version of the character, as well as good voicing by Thomas Jane as Jonah and character portrayal. What I've noticed with this and the other DC animated short films is that there less like adventures or battles, and more like ""A Day in the Life of""-type stories, which fits perfectly with the nature of the short films, and gets across what's good about the characters without overstaying their welcome. The short film is pretty good, in and of itself, but I'd do think that it's got kind of a cruel and dark ending, but then again I suppose it fits the character.",5,A great Batman film.,1373932800,"07

1338317,AOFC8T8U7WUGV,B003ES5JDS,Roland,"[2, 2]","...I just HAVE to write a review about this movie as it is one of the best I have seen in a long time...heck, one of the best movies I've seen, ever.BACKGROUND--Major Spoilers aheadI have always enjoyed comic books, the toys that come with them, posters, etc. However, I have never been too big a fan of the cartoons...just never really got into them as I thought (for example) the old 'Superfriends' were silly with the Wonder Twins and their pet monkey, Gleek, ridiculous plot lines, and such like.'Red Hood,' however, caught my attention as many friends recommended it to me...but mainly that I know 'Red Hood' is the original alias of the Joker.The name of the movie just sounded ...cool...so I gave it a look.I. Was. Blown. Away. I had hopes, somewhat high ones, going into this that I would enjoy this cartoon, but I had no idea how much I would enjoy it. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, period.There were no pet monkeys in this cartoon, by the way.WHERE TO BEGIN?Let's start with the voice cast: I understand most Batman fans were disappointed that the long-time voices of The Batman and The Joker: Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, respectively, were absent from this film, but I thought their replacements: Bruce Greenwood and John DiMaggio, did a great job. I've always liked Greenwood since seeing his portrayal of President Kennedy in 'Thirteen Days,' and I thought his Batman was spot-on, at least in my mind, of what the character should sound like.DiMaggio was a good Joker...more Jack Nicholson than Heath Ledger, but Mr. Ledger's performance will never be duplicated so why even bother to try?Neil Patrick Harris is great as Nightwing (Dick Grayson, the original Robin) as he brought humor to an otherwise very dark movie. However, he didn't have a lot of on-screen time, which is one of the few complaints I have with this film.Wade Williams is Black Mask, the gang leader who is at war with The Red Hood. Over-the-top and quite funny (think the 1960s TV show), I enjoyed his performance.Jason Isaacs is Ra's al Ghul. Isaacs gives the character a quiet dignity of a sort, mixed together with an authorative, self-righteous tone. Plus, Isaacs can do creepy quite well. Check out 'The Patriot' or 'Event Horizon' for further proof, if you need it.Finally, Jensen Ackles is Red Hood/Jason Todd. I felt Ackles stole the show as he brought a dramatic intensity to his character that completely swept me into the story. The raw emotion he conveyed, particularly in a scene with Batman near the end of the movie...I cannot describe it, it was great. No, beyond great.ANIMATIONI am not qualified to give technical aspects, but I thought this movie looked great. Gotham City visually looks like a mix of the Gotham City(s) from the Christian Bale and Michael Keaton movies--with a little 'Blade Runner' thrown in for good measure. The animation has an elegant flow to it...the heroes glide across the screen...and the only negatives I noticed were a couple of scenes in which characters are running and it (the running) looks kind of 'stop-motion choppy.' However, the visuals are quite stunning.STORYThe movie opens with the Joker brutally killing Jason Todd, the second 'Robin,' as Batman arrives just seconds late to save him. The violence depicted is brutal, despite being shown off-camera, and definitely not for children.The movie then jumps ahead five years and there is a new villain/vigilante in Gotham, killing any and all rivals who dare get in his way. He bargains with the Gotham drug dealers, telling them he'll protect them (mainly from himself) as long as he gets a huge cut--and they don't deal to children. This new villain is the Red Hood.Of course, it is only a matter of time before he crosses paths with Batman, and if not for Nightwing showing up to help out, the Red Hood may very well have defeated Batman in their first encounter...as Red Hood departs, he yells something that causes Batman to take pause...playing and sound-editing back a tape of their encounter later, Batman realizes Red Hood called him, 'Bruce.'Meanwhile, Black Mask is so frustrated with Red Hood's assault on his crime empire, he breaks the Joker out of Arkham Asylum hoping to enlist his help...which, of course, backfires. And, Batman discovers through detective work of his own that Red Hood and Jason Todd are the one and same...he then travels to Ra's al Ghul's lair and gets the details filled in.Finally, the Joker is now on the loose spreading chaos throughout Gotham City, only to be captured by Batman, but 'stolen,' if you will, from Batman by the Red Hood. All of this leads to the film's climax where Batman and Red Hood debate their different perspectives of morality: Red Hood stating he ""is the better Batman"" because he *kills* criminals, thus ridding the streets of them for good. Batman's response is that, as much as he would enjoy killing the Joker, he realizes that if he ever crosses that line...""there is no going back."" At this point, Red Hood has brutually beaten the Joker and is going to kill him. He tells Batman (GREAT performance here by Jensen Ackles) he needs to make a decision on......well, get the movie and *watch* it to see how it plays out!COMPLAINTSThey are minor, but...a short run-time, AND DEFINITELY not enough Nightwing/Neil Patrick Harris. As stated, his humor was much-needed in this gritty, violent film. True, Black Mask/Wade Williams was funny as well, but his humor comes while he is beating people up.FINALLYI give this movie a 10 out of 10. I really, REALLY enjoyed it.

The emotional depth in the story-line is fantastic.  The plot makes sense and is gripping.  The Joker, as always, is fantastic.

Seriously, don't think about this one...buy it!As a side note, the Blu-ray quality was fantastic, and definitely worth the few extra bucks.  The extras were equally as fascinating and good.

It also explored (in depth) the ""vote"" that went out to the public that ultimately decided whether Robin should live or die.

1338322,A3G5B9IXVO48,B003ES5JDS,Rudiger,"[0, 0]","Fitting three major villains and the mysterious namesake character into a 75 minute film is an admirably but perhaps overly ambitious project. Spiderman 3 couldn't pull off a three villain story with two hours.  Luckily the creators - mostly Judd Winnick, adapting his own comic - know what they're doing, and bring together multiple strands of Batman history that adds to, rather than distracts from, the central story.As a viewer with only a dim knowledge of the Batman comics history, I went into this without any strong opinion about Jason Todd, apparently a favorite target of fanboys, whose death at the hands of the Joker opens the film. Five years later, a vigilante known as the Red Hood makes his presence known in Gotham's underworld, mainly by killing and manipulating its members. The highest-profile of these members is Black Mask, who spends a lot of money trying to get rid of the new presence and who eventually asks for the Joker's help (spoiler: this ends up being a bad move). Batman's attention is necessarily demanded, and he approaches the Red Hood pretty much the same way he would approach any villain. Even with the aid of Nightwing, though, Batman is unable to apprehend him, a failure made eerier by the fact that the Red Hood seems to know an awful lot about the Dark Knight.Viewers expecting a typical DC Animated Universe outing might be shocked at the level of violence here. The grisly opening scene, while not showing anything more than a bit of blood, is still quite striking relative to the level of violence seen in other Batman animated releases. And this is only the start - lots of gun deaths and (offscreen) immolation and decapitation occur as well. It certainly earns its PG-13 rating, unlike, say, the uncut version of ""Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker.""This heightened violence is beneficial to the film for a number of reasons. In terms of character, it allows for a more psychopathic, less clowny version of the Joker. Fans will doubtless be comparing this version to the standard, Mark Hammill voiced DCAU incarnation, to which there is some resemblance. There are some sick laughs to be had in John DiMaggio's wry, sneering delivery, but this Joker is far more interested in death and destruction than theatrics. In terms of story and theme, it allows for the Red Hood character to be a vicious killer while undeniably undercutting the influence of Gotham's scum, bringing Batman's absolute injunction against killing into question on pragmatic and even ethical grounds.The film's technical aspects are first-rate. Voice acting is solid all around. Bruce Greenwood's Batman is pretty similar to Kevin Conroy, a good thing for most DCAU fans. Jensen Ackles does superbly as the Red Hood, giving the character a range of emotion from callous indifference to impassioned humanity. As mentioned, DiMaggio's Joker is convincingly psychopathic. We could have used more Neil Patrick Harris as Nightwing, who provides the bulk of the comic relief. Jason Isaacs delivers his few lines as Ra's Al Ghul with a silky elegance. The fight scenes, of which there are a lot, are inventive and visceral. Save for a couple of confusing gadgets, the action is coherent.The climax is the source of the film's only problems. A long dialogue about the conflicting morality behind the Red Hood and Batman's actions was inevitable, but it's handled clumsily. Also, the phrase ""Good Lord"" comes up a bit too much, and the two vigilantes reminded me of a couple of born-again Christians trying to hold back swears. This is quite a minor complaint, but it just seemed whitewashed.Overall this is a very dark and sophisticated film, and a fine addition to the DCAU.",4,"Dense and compelling, some minor flaws",1282089600,"08 18, 2010",2010,3688,"['Fitting', 'three', 'major', 'villains', 'mysterious', 'namesake', 'character', '75', 'minute', 'film', 'admirably', 'perhaps', 'overly', 'ambitious', 'project', 'Spiderman', '3', 'could', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'three', 'villain', 'story', 'two', 'hours', 'Luckily', 'creators', 'mostly', 'Judd', 'Winnick', 'adapting', 'own', 'comic', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'bring', 'together', 'multiple', 'strands', 'Batman', 'history', 'rather', 'distracts', 'central', 'story.As', 'viewer', 'only', 'dim', 'knowledge', 'Batman', 'comics', 'history', 'went', 'strong', 'opinion', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'apparently', 'favorite', 'target', 'fanboys', 'death', 'hands', 'Joker', 'film', 'Five', 'years', 'later', 'vigilante', 'known', 'Red', 'Hood', 'presence', 'known', 'Gotham', 'underworld', 'mainly', 'killing', 'manipulating', 'members', 'highest-profile', 'members', 'Black', 'Mask', 'who', 'lot', 'money', 'trying', 'get', 'rid', 'new', 'presence', 'who', 'eventually', 'Joker', 'help', 'spoiler', 'up', 'being', 'bad', 'move', 'Batman', 'attention', 'necessarily', 'demanded', 'Red', 'Hood', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'would', 'approach', 'villain', 'Even', 'aid', 'Nightwing', 'though', 'Batman', 'unable', 'apprehend', 'failure', 'made', 'eerier', 'fact', 'Red', 'Hood', 'know', 'awful', 'lot', 'Dark', 'Knight.Viewers', 'expecting', 'typical', 'DC', 'Animated', 'Universe', 'outing', 'might', 'be', 'shocked', 'level', 'violence', 'here', 'grisly', 'opening', 'scene', 'not', 'showing', 'anything', 'more', 'bit', 'blood', 'still', 'quite', 'striking', 'relative', 'level', 'violence', 'seen', 'other', 'Batman', 'animated', 'releases', 'only', 'start', 'lots', 'gun', 'deaths', 'offscreen', 'immolation', 'decapitation', 'occur', 'well', 'certainly', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'say', 'uncut', 'version', 'Batman', 'Beyond', 'Return', 'Joker', 'heightened', 'violence', 'beneficial', 'film', 'number', 'reasons', 'terms', 'character', 'more', 'psychopathic', 'less', 'clowny', 'version', 'Joker', 'Fans', 'will', 'doubtless', 'be', 'comparing', 'version', 'standard', 'Mark', 'Hammill', 'voiced', 'DCAU', 'incarnation', 'resemblance', 'are', 'sick', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'John', 'DiMaggio', 'wry', 'sneering', 'delivery', 'Joker', 'far', 'more', 'interested', 'death', 'destruction', 'theatrics', 'terms', 'story', 'theme', 'Red', 'Hood', 'character', 'be', 'vicious', 'killer', 'undeniably', 'undercutting', 'influence', 'Gotham', 'scum', 'bringing', 'Batman', 'absolute', 'injunction', 'killing', 'question', 'pragmatic', 'even', 'ethical', 'grounds.The', 'film', 'technical', 'aspects', 'are', 'first-rate', 'Voice', 'acting', 'solid', 'around', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Batman', 'pretty', 'similar', 'Kevin', 'Conroy', 'good', 'thing', 'most', 'DCAU', 'fans', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'superbly', 'Red', 'Hood', 'giving', 'character', 'range', 'emotion', 'callous', 'indifference', 'impassioned', 'humanity', 'mentioned', 'DiMaggio', 'Joker', 'convincingly', 'psychopathic', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'Nightwing', 'who', 'bulk', 'comic', 'relief', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'few', 'lines', 'Ra', 'Al', 'Ghul', 'silky', 'elegance', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'lot', 'are', 'inventive', 'visceral', 'Save', 'couple', 'confusing', 'gadgets', 'action', 'coherent.The', 'climax', 'source', 'film', 'only', 'problems', 'long', 'dialogue', 'conflicting', 'morality', 'Red', 'Hood', 'Batman', 'actions', 'was', 'inevitable', 'handled', 'clumsily', 'Also', 'phrase', 'Good', 'Lord', 'up', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'two', 'vigilantes', 'reminded', 'couple', 'born-again', 'Christians', 'trying', 'hold', 'back', 'swears', 'quite', 'minor', 'complaint', 'just', 'seemed', 'whitewashed.Overall', 'very', 'dark', 'sophisticated', 'film', 'fine', 'addition', 'DCAU']",Batman: Under the Red Hood

1338325,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B003ES5JDS,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[1, 1]","Batman: Under the Red Hood is the latest in the DC Universe series of animated DVDs.  The two-disc DVD is very special and tells a gripping story and gives lots of great features that you'd spend hours watching.The main event has to do with Jason Todd, the second Robin who was beaten to death with a crowbar by the Joker and then bombed out of existence -- or so we thought.  Batman began his darkness at this time, blaming himself for Todd's death.I though it interesting that the writers only touched on Jason Todd as Robin, not really getting deep into the history of the character -- just enough to interest the viewer but not so much as to bore me to death with details only a rabid fan would know.Still, the foam began forming around my gums as Batman hunts the Red Hood.  The Red Hood was also the name of The Joker back in the day (in the comics world, in the 1940s) and so he hunts up the Joker (with some special humor appeal from Nightwing) to see what Joker knows about this Red Hood character.The underworld is under his pay, 40% of all they bring to the drug trade to the Red Hood and he will provide protection.  This vigilante can't stop crime, he says, so he'll join them -- and kill anyone who gets in his way.Great fight scenes, some ingenious moves and some flash-back stories to a younger, more vibrant Jason Todd.  The story reminded me in many ways of the Hush storyline in its action and keeping the viewer guessing as to the Red Hood's identity.Features:Lots of backstory on the Robin character, from Dick Grayson's beginnings, his development into Nightwing and the early writers and artist's reasons for giving the lone Batman a sidekick in the first place.Two Batman-related videos from the early 1990s, where Robin finds the killers of his parents and Batman tries to prevent him from taking revenge.  Tight story, not a slow minute.The previews and trailers, I've seen most of them already:  Crisis on Two Earths and so on.  However, the first look into Superman/Batman Apocalypse with Darkseid as the powerful bad guy and a complete Supergirl origin story was right out of the Supergirl comics done by Michael Turner a few years ago.  But the story is expanded and the creators of the show really exude interest and excitement for this project.Lastly, some Jonah Hex animated stories.  The animation is not as top notch as the feature film, but does make for some interesting storytelling.  Jonah is looking for a man who is on his bounty list.  Except the man was murdered by a madam who kills first and kisses later.Bottom Line:The story and voice-acting abilities of Batman: Under the Hood create a dark, interesting view of a Batman who seems to have created a monster, full of anguish and what he can do to rectify the Red Hood and his crime spree -- regardless of how many criminals he has to walk through to stop him.A must-see for any Batman fan and a great intro to the DC Animated Universe of DVDs.Other DC Universe Films You Must See:Superman/Batman: Apocalypse (Two-Disc Amazon Exclusive Limited Edition with Litho Cel)Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths (Two-Disc Edition)Batman - The Animated Series, Volume One (DC Comics Classic Collection)",5,Dare to Look Under the Hood!,1280620800,"08 1, 2010",2010,3189,"['Batman', 'Red', 'Hood', 'latest', 'DC', 'Universe', 'series', 'animated', 'DVDs', 'two-disc', 'DVD', 'very', 'special', 'gripping', 'story', 'lots', 'great', 'features', ""'d"", 'spend', 'hours', 'watching.The', 'main', 'event', 'do', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'second', 'Robin', 'who', 'was', 'beaten', 'death', 'crowbar', 'Joker', 'then', 'bombed', 'existence', 'thought', 'Batman', 'began', 'darkness', 'time', 'blaming', 'Todd', 'death.I', 'interesting', 'writers', 'only', 'touched', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'Robin', 'not', 'really', 'getting', 'deep', 'history', 'character', 'just', 'enough', 'interest', 'viewer', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'bore', 'death', 'details', 'only', 'rabid', 'fan', 'would', 'know.Still', 'foam', 'began', 'forming', 'gums', 'Batman', 'Red', 'Hood', 'Red', 'Hood', 'was', 'also', 'name', 'Joker', 'back', 'day', 'comics', 'world', '1940s', 'so', 'up', 'Joker', 'special', 'humor', 'appeal', 'Nightwing', 'see', 'what', 'Joker', 'Red', 'Hood', 'character.The', 'underworld', 'pay', '40', '%', 'bring', 'drug', 'trade', 'Red', 'Hood', 'will', 'provide', 'protection', 'vigilante', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'crime', ""'ll"", 'join', 'kill', 'anyone', 'who', 'way.Great', 'fight', 'scenes', 'ingenious', 'moves', 'flash-back', 'stories', 'younger', 'more', 'vibrant', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'story', 'reminded', 'many', 'ways', 'Hush', 'storyline', 'action', 'keeping', 'viewer', 'guessing', 'Red', 'Hood', 'identity.Features', 'Lots', 'backstory', 'Robin', 'character', 'Dick', 'Grayson', 'beginnings', 'development', 'Nightwing', 'early', 'writers', 'artist', 'reasons', 'giving', 'lone', 'Batman', 'sidekick', 'first', 'place.Two', 'Batman-related', 'videos', 'early', '1990s', 'where', 'Robin', 'killers', 'parents', 'Batman', 'prevent', 'taking', 'revenge', 'Tight', 'story', 'not', 'slow', 'minute.The', 'previews', 'trailers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'already', 'Crisis', 'Two', 'Earths', 'so', 'However', 'first', 'look', 'Superman/Batman', 'Apocalypse', 'Darkseid', 'powerful', 'bad', 'guy', 'complete', 'Supergirl', 'origin', 'story', 'was', 'right', 'Supergirl', 'comics', 'done', 'Michael', 'Turner', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'story', 'expanded', 'creators', 'show', 'really', 'exude', 'interest', 'excitement', 'project.Lastly', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'animated', 'stories', 'animation', 'not', 'top', 'notch', 'feature', 'film', 'make', 'interesting', 'storytelling', 'Jonah', 'looking', 'man', 'who', 'bounty', 'list', 'man', 'was', 'murdered', 'madam', 'who', 'first', 'later.Bottom', 'Line', 'story', 'voice-acting', 'abilities', 'Batman', 'Hood', 'create', 'dark', 'interesting', 'view', 'Batman', 'who', 'have', 'created', 'monster', 'full', 'anguish', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'rectify', 'Red', 'Hood', 'crime', 'spree', 'regardless', 'how', 'many', 'criminals', 'walk', 'stop', 'him.A', 'must-see', 'Batman', 'fan', 'great', 'intro', 'DC', 'Animated', 'Universe', 'DVDs.Other', 'DC', 'Universe', 'Films', 'Must', 'See', 'Superman/Batman', 'Apocalypse', 'Two-Disc', 'Amazon', 'Exclusive', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'Litho', 'Cel', 'Justice', 'League', 'Crisis', 'Two', 'Earths', 'Two-Disc', 'Edition', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'Volume', 'One', 'DC', 'Comics', 'Classic', 'Collection']",Batman: Under the Red Hood
1338326,A1EJ9BMB058DRV,B003ES5JDS,"Shelley D. Bowen ""Afficianado""","[1, 1]","As I was saying, if you enjoyed the animated series from the 90's or the Tim Burton style of dark/brooding atmosphere, you'll love this animated movie. I don't want to ruin the plot for anyone so I'll just say what I think makes this movie so good without giving away too much. In ""Under the Red Hood"", Batman is portrayed as a hybrid of the dark knight from the kid friendly ""Batman: The Animated Series"" of the 90's and the portrayal shown in Tim Burton's ""Batman"" from 1989. Both Batman and Bruce Wayne are portrayed perfectly by Bruce Greenwood. All of Batman's gadgets and vehicles (including the Batmobile and the Batwing) all very closely resemble 1989's portrayal while also blending elements of the animated series. The Joker appears in this a lot and is again a hybrid of Mark Hamill and Jack Nicholson's portrayals of the Joker and the blend is superb (although the new voice may take some getting used to at first). Nightwing appears here and his outfit and demeanor is much less out of place than Robin but he can still kind of make things campier than they need to be at times (luckily, he isn't a main character and isn't featured much). Robin is a secondary character yet he is the basis of the story (I won't lay out the plot except that this involves Batman's failed training of a second ""Robin""). I love the fact that this movie is PG-13 because it allows the story to be told in a way that it never could have if it were targeted to a younger audience. The reason it got the rating is that people die in this (sometimes brutally), they are tortured, there is more profanity, more talk about drugs and in-depth details of organized crime, and probably the fact that it's just much more bloody and dark. This movie has very few flaws though and I would rank it up there with some of the better live-action Batman movies (not to mention the superb ""Mask of the Phantasm"").For die-hard Batman fans, this is a must buy.For fans of live action Batman movies, take a look at some of the animated series shows or movies first.For fans of the animated series, be warned that this is much more intense than what was released in the 90's or targeted to children back then with the straight to movie releases.Recommended.",5,If you liked the 90's animated series/Tim Burton.....,1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,2229,"['was', 'saying', 'enjoyed', 'animated', 'series', '90', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'style', 'dark/brooding', 'atmosphere', ""'ll"", 'love', 'animated', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'plot', 'anyone', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'what', 'think', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'Red', 'Hood', 'Batman', 'portrayed', 'hybrid', 'dark', 'knight', 'kid', 'friendly', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', '90', 'portrayal', 'shown', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Batman', '1989', 'Batman', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'are', 'portrayed', 'perfectly', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Batman', 'gadgets', 'vehicles', 'including', 'Batmobile', 'Batwing', 'very', 'closely', 'resemble', '1989', 'portrayal', 'also', 'blending', 'elements', 'animated', 'series', 'Joker', 'lot', 'again', 'hybrid', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'portrayals', 'Joker', 'blend', 'superb', 'new', 'voice', 'may', 'take', 'getting', 'used', 'first', 'Nightwing', 'here', 'outfit', 'demeanor', 'much', 'less', 'place', 'Robin', 'can', 'still', 'kind', 'make', 'things', 'campier', 'need', 'be', 'times', 'luckily', ""n't"", 'main', 'character', ""n't"", 'featured', 'much', 'Robin', 'secondary', 'character', 'yet', 'basis', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lay', 'out', 'plot', 'Batman', 'failed', 'training', 'second', 'Robin', 'love', 'fact', 'movie', 'PG-13', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'way', 'never', 'could', 'have', 'were', 'targeted', 'younger', 'audience', 'reason', 'got', 'rating', 'people', 'die', 'sometimes', 'brutally', 'are', 'tortured', 'more', 'profanity', 'more', 'talk', 'drugs', 'in-depth', 'details', 'organized', 'crime', 'probably', 'fact', 'just', 'much', 'more', 'bloody', 'dark', 'movie', 'very', 'few', 'flaws', 'would', 'rank', 'up', 'there', 'better', 'live-action', 'Batman', 'movies', 'not', 'mention', 'superb', 'Mask', 'Phantasm', '.For', 'die-hard', 'Batman', 'fans', 'must', 'buy.For', 'fans', 'live', 'action', 'Batman', 'movies', 'take', 'look', 'animated', 'series', 'shows', 'movies', 'first.For', 'fans', 'animated', 'series', 'be', 'warned', 'much', 'more', 'intense', 'what', 'was', 'released', '90', 'targeted', 'children', 'back', 'then', 'straight', 'movie', 'releases.Recommended']",Batman: Under the Red Hood

1338337,A2OCJNB6B46OKP,B003ES5JDS,"Underground Reborn ""gnome""","[0, 0]","One thing that can be said about Batman is that his character as a whole has created a monster fan base. Part of that fan base that grew up with the Dark Knight has actually had the privilege to create some of his most memorable adventures. Bruce Timms' newest animated movie `Batman: Under The Red Hood' is one of the more recent Batman classics brought to us. What makes this story so special is that it was derived from one of the darkest stories in Batman's legacy, and that story revolved around the death of the second Robin. Historically the death of Jason Todd is known as `Batman's greatest failure'. What Under The Red Hood does is takes `A Death In The Family' and adds a whole new chapter. Deriving from the major elements it turns `Death' into a much larger story with an incredible epilogue. As much as I would have loved to s `A Death In The Family' brought to life, `Under The Red Hood' may in fact be the best Batman story the DCAU has offered us.The story that this film gives us takes place five years after the death of Jason Todd. Suddenly the crime lords of Gotham City have a new threat and he is this merciless vigilante known as Red Hood. His mission is to keep the mob in line and make sure that while their actions continue to flourish, they have to work under his rules. Because, if they step out of line, they die. Of course Batman leaps into action to try and take him down, but once he gets too close to this new threat his world will be shattered when he discovers who Red Hood truly is.This movie was such an incredible piece. It is definitely the darkest film up until this point, but it is such a well executed story. There are however a few negatives, but I will go with the positives first. What I loved about this film was the homage to the ending of `A Death In The Family'. While it is not as graphic as depicted on the pages of the comic, keep in mind that this film is rated PG-13. Still, they kept the actions taken and the dialogue intact and it is such a gripping scene to watch. That feeling that you get in that moment carries on all the way to the end of the film. The final showdown with Batman & Red Hood is incredible. I have never seen such passion and emotion thrown into one of these films up until now and I have to say that I had to re-watch that whole final scene, just because it was so well done. On that note the voice acting was perfect. Bruce Greenwood did a spot on job as Batman. I have to admit, there were points in the film where I couldn't even tell it was him because he sounded so similar to Kevin Conroy. What made Greenwood a better choice for this film was the passion in his voice especially when he raised his voice. Jensen Ackles was great as Red Hood. He started out just as a regular voice actor, but the scenes he has with Batman are so great. The final showdown he puts almost an Oscar worthy performance, I have to say I was enthralled. John DiMaggio took on the Joker. Now, I have to say that many people always hate when Mark Hammil isn't there, but let's face it with a movie as heavy as this one Mark Hammil's voice would just come of extremely cartoonish. Don't get me wrong in Phantasm and Return of the Joker he does a great job, but take a look at those movies in general and compare them to the setting of Red Hood. I promise you, you will understand why they used another actor. Still DiMaggio as a plus turns on that Mark Hammil Joker charm in this film, but the voice he brings is a darker, creepier Joker and it's a win for this film. The best voice would have to be Wade Williams as Black Mask. He brings sheer over the top villainy to Black Mask. It is one of those voices that just makes the character so evil you grin with delight at his madness. Black Mask was this guy that would get so high strung in two seconds he would punch through a brick wall.So, what are the faults of `Under The Red Hood?' It was too short. A movie of such grandeur should be more than 79 minutes. I don't know why Bruce Timm thinks that we have such short attention spans. There were so many great things thrown into this package that I felt there wasn't enough. An example would Neil Patrick Harris as Nightwing. I could watch NPH perform in front of a brick wall for 3 hours and be entertained. He breathed great life into his character, but it would have been great just to see more action with him in it. The flashbacks of Jason Todd were great as well. I thought maybe it would have been a plus to throw some flashbacks of Dick Grayson as Robin maybe to see him depart from Batman or encounter him for the first time as Nightwing. Yet, I digress.`Under the Red Hood' is a great film, mostly because it revolves around the Robin character. Robin is a persona in DC comics that is always blasted by fans because of the camp of the silver age and the old Adam West show. Still, Robin is probably one of the most important characters because he brings a human side out in Batman. To see what Batman goes through when a hero that he trained becomes something he shouldn't be it just makes the Batman persona more of a legend, but more than that a hero with a heart.  Also if you are planning to get this film on DVD, purchase the two disc edition, which features another DC Showcase short. This one features Jonah Hex, and since his movie bombed this will be all the Jonah Hex you need.",5,The Best DCAU Film To Date.

Charaters seem spot on as well... A Batman obsessed with his mission, a Nightwing that remembers he moved on b/c he was tired of batman's crap and a joker that's just crazy as hell. I love how DC has started making their movies darker and less dependent on the 90's animated series. The movie starts with Joker beating robin with a tire iron, later kills another crime bosses 8 guards like it's nothing, and later has the joker pouring gasoline over a rival crime boss trying to set them ablaze to get the attention of the title characters... That's how I like my joker, bat-snot crazy with a smile. Another scene a gangster is about to light up a rival mobster with a molotov cocktail and the red hood shoots the bottle setting the would be killer ablaze.The voice actors did a great job. The story was awesome, dark, and seriously action packed. And they packed more characters in than I was expecting to see. DC has been slowly stepping up their game lately ever since Marvel merged with Disney.*People need to stop reviewing this movie poorly because they didn't use the original voice actors. Hamill has not voiced Joker (except in the game Arkham Asylum) since like 2003... deal with it.*People also need to stop reviewing this movie lower because the FREE digital copy they got doesn't work with their Macs.
