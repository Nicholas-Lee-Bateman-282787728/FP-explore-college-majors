306913,A2YALLK1XG52FS,6302309514,Bufford D. Moore,"[14, 14]","I recently had a chance to see the Doctor again, albeit with different eyes. The basic story line regards a cardiovascular surgeon, technically brillant but bereft of human touch. Indeed, initially, he seems somewhat proud of his aloof stance, almost trying to make it into an advantage. He relates to his patients and residents as I have seen many physicians do. Truthfully, the more awful the diagnosis, the more at arms length many physicians hold the situation. Physicians routinely mention that a patient might die, but it's rarely really true and gets mentioned as a matter of fact. When death is really a possibility, it is much harder to say that you might die. Dr McKee comes face to face with this when he becomes the patient, diagnosed with a malignant laryngeal tumor he faces the rigors of radiation treatment and when this fails surgery. He finds that the standoffish posture he had always adopted no longer worked, and the impersonal surgeon he has no longer can do all the things he needs done, both surgically and emotionally.I had to come face to face with some of these issues when I had to have heart surgery. Truthfully, the hospitals involved did treat me with some preference, but the fears and risks were the same. I learned first hand about the reticence of surgeons to talk about a real risk of death. My surgeon left a blank consent for me to sign. I dutifully filled out the consent including risks and benefits, like a good resident. I missed the chance to look him in the eye and tell him that I trusted him with my life, all the while realizing that it would have made him uncomfortable.... it always makes me uncomfortable. See, while we all realize that what we do carries significant risks, surgeons in the US are very well trained and do very good work. We all tend to assume that things will go very well; and they so often do that we tend to forget that they might not. We become uncomfortable when we realize that just those things are what patients are focused on, just those chances that things might not go well.Everybody needs the human touch. Even when they seem not to want it.See the movie. There are times that it's uncomfortable, but that's how it is sometimes, isn't it?",5,A personal experience/ A must see movie,1113004800,"04 9, 2005",2005,2218,"['recently', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'Doctor', 'again', 'different', 'eyes', 'basic', 'story', 'line', 'cardiovascular', 'surgeon', 'technically', 'brillant', 'bereft', 'human', 'touch', 'Indeed', 'initially', 'somewhat', 'proud', 'aloof', 'stance', 'almost', 'trying', 'make', 'advantage', 'patients', 'residents', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'physicians', 'do', 'Truthfully', 'more', 'awful', 'diagnosis', 'more', 'arms', 'length', 'many', 'physicians', 'hold', 'situation', 'Physicians', 'routinely', 'mention', 'patient', 'might', 'die', 'rarely', 'really', 'true', 'mentioned', 'matter', 'fact', 'When', 'death', 'really', 'possibility', 'much', 'harder', 'say', 'might', 'die', 'Dr', 'McKee', 'face', 'face', 'when', 'patient', 'diagnosed', 'malignant', 'laryngeal', 'tumor', 'rigors', 'radiation', 'treatment', 'when', 'surgery', 'standoffish', 'posture', 'had', 'always', 'adopted', 'no', 'longer', 'worked', 'impersonal', 'surgeon', 'no', 'longer', 'can', 'do', 'things', 'done', 'surgically', 'emotionally.I', 'had', 'come', 'face', 'face', 'issues', 'when', 'had', 'have', 'heart', 'surgery', 'Truthfully', 'hospitals', 'involved', 'did', 'treat', 'preference', 'fears', 'risks', 'were', 'same', 'learned', 'first', 'hand', 'reticence', 'surgeons', 'talk', 'real', 'risk', 'death', 'surgeon', 'left', 'blank', 'consent', 'sign', 'dutifully', 'filled', 'out', 'consent', 'including', 'risks', 'benefits', 'good', 'resident', 'missed', 'chance', 'look', 'eye', 'tell', 'trusted', 'life', 'while', 'realizing', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'uncomfortable', 'always', 'uncomfortable', 'See', 'realize', 'what', 'do', 'significant', 'risks', 'surgeons', 'US', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'trained', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'work', 'tend', 'assume', 'things', 'will', 'go', 'very', 'well', 'so', 'often', 'do', 'tend', 'forget', 'might', 'not', 'become', 'uncomfortable', 'when', 'realize', 'just', 'things', 'are', 'what', 'patients', 'are', 'focused', 'just', 'chances', 'things', 'might', 'not', 'go', 'well.Everybody', 'human', 'touch', 'Even', 'when', 'seem', 'not', 'want', 'it.See', 'movie', 'are', 'times', 'uncomfortable', 'how', 'sometimes', ""n't""]",The Doctor VHS

306917,A2WP23WKNP4TFN,6302309514,Christopher Bonds,"[8, 8]","""The Doctor"" is one of my favorite films. I have seen it maybe 10 times (on VHS) and know much of it by heart. There is nothing artificial about this film. It is a human story about real people, well directed and edited, and with sincere, fleshed-out performances from everyone in the cast.At the opening we see the successful heart surgeon Dr. Jack McKee, quite full of himself, performing another major operation while ""Let's Get Drunk and Screw"" plays in the background. We see him as he makes his rounds, failing in his attempts to interact on a human level with his patients, substituting crude attempts at humor for genuine compassion. We see him failing at home as well, as his professional life alienates him from his wife and son. All this begins to change when a seemingly minor throat irritation is diagnosed as laryngeal cancer. Then he learns what it is like to be on the other side of the medical profession, and it changes his life.William Hurt is perfect as Jack McKee, and he is wonderfully supported by Christine Lahti, who plays his wife, and Elizabeth Perkins, who gives an amazing performance as June, a young woman with a grade 4 brain tumor who has a powerful impact on Hurt's character. June and Jack share a scene in the desert at sundown that gives me a lump in the throat every time.Also worth mentioning are Wendy Crewson, who plays a rather nasty ENT surgeon who gives Jack a dose of his own medicine (so to speak), and Adam Arkin as Dr. Eli Blumfield, ""the Rabbi"", who has often been the butt of Jack's humor around the hospital, because he talks to his patients while they are anesthetized.The Doctor is a film that illustrates the importance of treating people as human beings and not as objects or numbers on a chart.

306920,AUHG8KSHI529U,6302309514,Craig Matteson,"[45, 47]","This movie was made from a book by a doctor who told his own story about becoming ill and learning about the medical profession and its dehumanizing qualities by becoming a patient.  It caused quite a stir at the time and this movie was quite popular when it came out.  William Hurt plays the successful, brilliant, but cold heart surgeon, Dr. Jack MacKee.  He and his beautiful wife, Anne (played so well by Christine Lahti), live a materially comfortable but emotionally detached existence with their son, Nicky.Dr. Jack has been ignoring a raspy throat and cough until he coughs up blood.  Soon, he is diagnosed with a tumor on one of his vocal cords.  He becomes the patient of Dr. Leslie Abbott who is even colder than him, she is talented but sees only problems to fix, the person exists to her only as something to bring her the illness to cure.  The doctors in this film are largely all of the same stripe.  They are supreme problem solvers who avoid any involvement with the people they are treating.  The one exception, and an object of ridicule of the other doctors is Dr. Eli Blumfield (portrayed very nicely by Adam Arkin).As a patient, the unhuman sterility of the hospital and its policies become clear to Dr. Jack as he is treated as a container for the problem the doctors are to fix.  One of the things all patients do is wait, and then wait, and then wait some more.  While he is thus engaged in waiting helplessly for treatment he meets another patient, June Ellis (heroically played by Elizabeth Perkins).  She is dying of a grade IV glioblastoma (a type of brain tumor).  One of her complaints is that they should have found her tumor sooner.  At first, Dr. Jack does the ""team"" thing by refusing to admit that they should have and giving her false hope with a lie about a patient in a similar condition who is now a grandfather.As an aside, one of my family members died of a grade IV glioblastoma.  It doesn't matter when they diagnose the patient.  The treatments they offer are all about stalling death, not preventing it.  In nearly all cases, the patient will die within a year.  June's lack of functional deficit and lack of a surgical scar on her scalp are all dramatic license to help keep June completely sympathetic (gruesome is not sympathetic).  Her head is shaved, but radiation treatment does not leave the scalp with a neatly shaved look.  The hair falls out unevenly, and the high does of radiation often leaves the skin reddened and raw from being burned.  There is no reason to hold back on the radiation dose, since it was all a Hail Mary kind of treatment.  I hope the treatments have gotten better since 1999 and that someday real hope can be offered those afflicted with this miserable condition.  The one great lesson life offers during this time is how little is needed to find life precious.  We spend so much time putting conditions on our happiness that we cheat ourselves of so much.  This kind of illness takes away the ability to even have good days and eventually even good hours.  Good moments become wonderful and intensely full of life.  Something as simple as a chicken salad sandwich and lemon poppyseed cake with a can of Vernors can provide an exquisitely memorable moment.  The movie captures this to a degree, but not as powerfully as it can happen in real life.Anyway, June becomes the means to Dr. Jack finding his humanity and becoming a better person and doctor.  It is nice that the screenplay has Dr. Jack finding his way in a very uneven and often frustrating way.  The movie ends with a kind of dramatic gag that rewards the audience for following an often grim story all the way through.Good movie, good notes for all people - including medical professionals - to take about the importance of treating those with whom we interact on a daily basis as real people rather than as an impersonal piece of business.",4,A good film on the importance of being actual people,1110067200,"03 6, 2005",2005,3881,"['movie', 'was', 'made', 'book', 'doctor', 'who', 'told', 'own', 'story', 'becoming', 'ill', 'learning', 'medical', 'profession', 'dehumanizing', 'qualities', 'becoming', 'patient', 'caused', 'quite', 'stir', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'popular', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'William', 'Hurt', 'successful', 'brilliant', 'cold', 'heart', 'surgeon', 'Dr.', 'Jack', 'MacKee', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Anne', 'played', 'so', 'well', 'Christine', 'Lahti', 'live', 'materially', 'comfortable', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'existence', 'son', 'Nicky.Dr', 'Jack', 'been', 'ignoring', 'raspy', 'throat', 'cough', 'up', 'blood', 'Soon', 'diagnosed', 'tumor', 'one', 'vocal', 'cords', 'patient', 'Dr.', 'Leslie', 'Abbott', 'who', 'even', 'colder', 'talented', 'only', 'problems', 'fix', 'person', 'only', 'something', 'bring', 'illness', 'cure', 'doctors', 'film', 'are', 'largely', 'same', 'stripe', 'are', 'supreme', 'problem', 'solvers', 'who', 'avoid', 'involvement', 'people', 'are', 'treating', 'one', 'exception', 'object', 'ridicule', 'other', 'doctors', 'Dr.', 'Eli', 'Blumfield', 'portrayed', 'very', 'nicely', 'Adam', 'Arkin', 'patient', 'unhuman', 'sterility', 'hospital', 'policies', 'become', 'clear', 'Dr.', 'Jack', 'treated', 'container', 'problem', 'doctors', 'are', 'fix', 'One', 'things', 'patients', 'do', 'wait', 'then', 'wait', 'then', 'wait', 'more', 'thus', 'engaged', 'waiting', 'helplessly', 'treatment', 'patient', 'June', 'Ellis', 'heroically', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'dying', 'grade', 'IV', 'glioblastoma', 'type', 'brain', 'tumor', 'One', 'complaints', 'should', 'have', 'found', 'tumor', 'sooner', 'first', 'Dr.', 'Jack', 'team', 'thing', 'refusing', 'admit', 'should', 'have', 'giving', 'false', 'hope', 'lie', 'patient', 'similar', 'condition', 'who', 'now', 'grandfather.As', 'aside', 'one', 'family', 'members', 'died', 'grade', 'IV', 'glioblastoma', ""n't"", 'matter', 'when', 'diagnose', 'patient', 'treatments', 'offer', 'are', 'stalling', 'death', 'not', 'preventing', 'nearly', 'cases', 'patient', 'will', 'die', 'year', 'June', 'lack', 'functional', 'deficit', 'lack', 'surgical', 'scar', 'scalp', 'are', 'dramatic', 'license', 'help', 'keep', 'June', 'completely', 'sympathetic', 'gruesome', 'not', 'sympathetic', 'head', 'shaved', 'radiation', 'treatment', 'not', 'leave', 'scalp', 'neatly', 'shaved', 'look', 'hair', 'out', 'unevenly', 'high', 'radiation', 'often', 'skin', 'reddened', 'raw', 'being', 'burned', 'reason', 'hold', 'back', 'radiation', 'dose', 'was', 'Hail', 'Mary', 'kind', 'treatment', 'hope', 'treatments', 'have', 'gotten', 'better', '1999', 'someday', 'real', 'hope', 'can', 'be', 'offered', 'afflicted', 'miserable', 'condition', 'one', 'great', 'lesson', 'life', 'offers', 'time', 'how', 'little', 'needed', 'find', 'life', 'precious', 'spend', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'putting', 'conditions', 'happiness', 'cheat', 'ourselves', 'so', 'much', 'kind', 'illness', 'away', 'ability', 'even', 'have', 'good', 'days', 'eventually', 'even', 'good', 'hours', 'Good', 'moments', 'become', 'wonderful', 'intensely', 'full', 'life', 'Something', 'as', 'simple', 'chicken', 'salad', 'sandwich', 'lemon', 'poppyseed', 'cake', 'can', 'Vernors', 'can', 'provide', 'exquisitely', 'memorable', 'moment', 'movie', 'degree', 'not', 'as', 'powerfully', 'can', 'happen', 'real', 'life.Anyway', 'June', 'means', 'Dr.', 'Jack', 'finding', 'humanity', 'becoming', 'better', 'person', 'doctor', 'nice', 'screenplay', 'Dr.', 'Jack', 'finding', 'way', 'very', 'uneven', 'often', 'frustrating', 'way', 'movie', 'kind', 'dramatic', 'gag', 'audience', 'following', 'often', 'grim', 'story', 'way', 'through.Good', 'movie', 'good', 'notes', 'people', 'including', 'medical', 'professionals', 'take', 'importance', 'treating', 'whom', 'interact', 'daily', 'basis', 'real', 'people', 'rather', 'impersonal', 'piece', 'business']",The Doctor VHS

I was glad to see William Hurt in a much better character than in Tuck Everlasting.  He did an excellent job in transition of character.  I thought it was well balanced in that the movie was not 'doctor or hospital bashing' but showing up the coldness and frivilous attitudes sometimes shown toward patients. I can appreciate this having worked in a medical center for 9 years and having been a patient for major surgery myself but in my case having several sweethearts for nurses (except for one).

Since this 100 was rarely shown on tv, should I let them go or buy dvd copies.  The Doctor fell into this category.  Especially, since I rarely see it being played on tv, I bought a used copy on Amazon and I am glad I did.I had forgotten how moving the film is and most important, how strong the actors made these characters.  To be sure, there is some predictability in the story of a self-important, detached doctor who finds himself in the patient role. On my recent re-viewing of this film what struck me is how much more relevant the story is now, with non-caring insurance companies determining the treatments we receive.  Today, uncaring doctors are actually the LEAST of our problems!Another eye-opener is that this movie apparently was never widely released in a dvd format.  I couldn't believe the cost for a Region 1 dvd of this film!  The most reasonable copy I found was a Region 2, so I snapped it up.By the way, lots of obscure movies are available on Region 2 and Phillips has a region free dvd player for around $40 - well worth it.

306946,A2GS4P0VOJYU96,6302309514,Patrick Thompson,"[77, 79]","After getting over the initial shock of seeing half the cast of Chicago Hope (when it was still a good show...and not the pale imitation of itself that it later became: Alan Arkin, Mandy Patinkin, Christine Lahti), this movie evolves into a fine, quiet, character driven drama. There are no great heroics, apart from June (Elizabeth Perkins), and even those are real, not manipulative, cliched, corny or obvious.This is a movie that works to develop its characters and plot simultaneously and without artifice or obvious (groanable/cringe inducing) plot devices. None of them are in anwyay what you would call 'extreme' or cliched. They are just very normal people placed is a very stressful situation- the doctor being diagnosed with a growth in his throat and the changes in many lives this growth causes. The changes are both good, bad and 'educational' for most of them.  The subplot- hospitals, statistics, malpractice cases, protecting each other- is subdued, never moralized or sermonized on but explored in a way whereby you can make your own judgements, based on some realistics situations (imagine a situation where somebody's life was worth less than $1000). The cast compliment each other and really connect. This movie is quite subtle at times and doesn't use in your face methods to make a point.This is a movie then that is honest, beautifully made, accessible and at times really funny, and at times really raw and saddening. It isn't an episode of ER. So if you're looking for high medical drama look elsewhere. But if you're looking for real multi-layered human drama then look here. Honesty is the key word and theme in the movie (which if you watch it you'll understand what I mean). Honesty to oneself, others and just to the concept in general. And how too, sometimes we find spiritual and psychological 'healing' in the midst of the greatest physical peril.The DVD contains no special features, only the movie, scene selection and set-up. Though it was made in 1990, it doesn't look too dated (apart from the cell-phones).I have to admit watching this movie, I looked at the clock on the DVD player and actually hoped it wouldn't end. How many movies can you say that about?I think the best moment in the story is when the doctor reads the  story June gave him. I think there is a lesson in that that is relevant to all of us. Hopefully you'll get the opportunity to see what I mean by watching this movie.SO in all, a brilliant, engrossing, poignant and real human drama built around believeable characters doing normal things and suffering typical tragedies that are enormous in our own lives. These are people we can understand and relate to, not the superficial and stereotypical larger-than-life, weirder-than-fiction characters designed to play with our minds and strum on our heartstrings. These people do touch your heart and mind for the right reasons...And maybe, if only for a moment, it causes you to question and reassess how you deal with others and the face you present the world, then maybe it has helped heal you a little bit too...If you need it, as most of us do.",5,A dose of your own medicine,1076025600,"02 6, 2004",2004,3105,"['getting', 'initial', 'shock', 'seeing', 'cast', 'Chicago', 'Hope', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'show', 'not', 'pale', 'imitation', 'later', 'became', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'Christine', 'Lahti', 'movie', 'fine', 'quiet', 'character', 'driven', 'drama', 'are', 'great', 'heroics', 'apart', 'June', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'even', 'are', 'real', 'not', 'manipulative', 'cliched', 'corny', 'obvious.This', 'movie', 'develop', 'characters', 'plot', 'simultaneously', 'artifice', 'obvious', 'groanable/cringe', 'inducing', 'plot', 'devices', 'None', 'are', 'anwyay', 'what', 'would', 'call', ""'extreme"", 'cliched', 'are', 'just', 'very', 'normal', 'people', 'placed', 'very', 'stressful', 'situation-', 'doctor', 'being', 'diagnosed', 'growth', 'throat', 'changes', 'many', 'lives', 'growth', 'changes', 'are', 'good', 'bad', ""'educational"", 'most', 'subplot-', 'hospitals', 'statistics', 'malpractice', 'cases', 'protecting', 'other-', 'subdued', 'never', 'moralized', 'sermonized', 'explored', 'way', 'can', 'make', 'own', 'judgements', 'based', 'realistics', 'situations', 'imagine', 'situation', 'where', 'somebody', 'life', 'was', 'worth', 'less', '1000', 'cast', 'compliment', 'other', 'really', 'connect', 'movie', 'quite', 'subtle', 'times', ""n't"", 'use', 'face', 'methods', 'make', 'point.This', 'movie', 'then', 'honest', 'beautifully', 'made', 'accessible', 'times', 'really', 'funny', 'times', 'really', 'raw', 'saddening', ""n't"", 'episode', 'ER', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'high', 'medical', 'drama', 'look', 'elsewhere', ""'re"", 'looking', 'real', 'multi-layered', 'human', 'drama', 'then', 'look', 'here', 'Honesty', 'key', 'word', 'theme', 'movie', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'what', 'mean', 'Honesty', 'oneself', 'others', 'just', 'concept', 'general', 'how', 'too', 'sometimes', 'find', 'spiritual', 'psychological', ""'healing"", 'midst', 'greatest', 'physical', 'peril.The', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'only', 'movie', 'scene', 'selection', 'set-up', 'was', 'made', '1990', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'dated', 'apart', 'cell-phones', 'have', 'admit', 'watching', 'movie', 'looked', 'clock', 'DVD', 'player', 'actually', 'hoped', 'would', ""n't"", 'end', 'How', 'many', 'movies', 'can', 'say', 'about', 'think', 'best', 'moment', 'story', 'when', 'doctor', 'story', 'June', 'gave', 'think', 'lesson', 'relevant', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'get', 'opportunity', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'watching', 'movie.SO', 'brilliant', 'engrossing', 'poignant', 'real', 'human', 'drama', 'built', 'believeable', 'characters', 'doing', 'normal', 'things', 'suffering', 'typical', 'tragedies', 'are', 'enormous', 'own', 'lives', 'are', 'people', 'can', 'understand', 'relate', 'not', 'superficial', 'stereotypical', 'larger-than-life', 'weirder-than-fiction', 'characters', 'designed', 'play', 'minds', 'strum', 'heartstrings', 'people', 'do', 'touch', 'heart', 'mind', 'right', 'reasons', 'maybe', 'only', 'moment', 'question', 'reassess', 'how', 'deal', 'others', 'face', 'present', 'world', 'then', 'maybe', 'helped', 'heal', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'need', 'most', 'do']",The Doctor VHS

Its a shame that human beings can be so jaded and cold until they themselves experience trauma and suffering. It would be a better world if we as humans cared more about one another no matter if our own state of health is excellent or not. None the less The Doctor is a powerful lesson in humanity. Humanity that is inquired through ones own suffering. Stopping to take a long look in the mirror at our own selfishness somehow seems much easier when we have some misery of our own in which to relate to it.

And I will immediately fall in love with it, and have it instantly enter my top 100 (at least) list of favorite movies of all time.  After initially viewing this, and coming away with such a favorable opinion, the way I tell if a movie is really as great as I thought upon first seeing it, is that I'm compelled to watch it again, and again, in a short period of time.  So it was with ""The Doctor,"" which I saw on cable on-demand, and which I can't really recommend enough.  Especially to ANYONE involved in our so-called ""health industries.""  And to all the truly great (or could be) ""doctors"" out there whose main concerns are ""empathy"" and ""ethics,"" as far as how they think of, treat, and relate to their ""patients.""  But essentially, I'd hope almost anyone could get something very deep, important, and meaningful from these proceedings.Only recently, while I was perusing through various on-demand films and their descriptions, did I find the time to watch this movie.  Within a few days, I had watched it several times, and confirmed my original opinion.  This is a GREAT movie, from beginning to end.  In fact, it should be REQUIRED viewing for anyone involved in the American ""medical professions,"" even and especially nowadays, almost 20 years after this film was first made.  In that way, it is kind of like ""Patch Adams"" in my view.  But unlike that movie, this one, again based upon a true story, takes place in and around hospitals, not at a medical school.  And while there is humor here, even if many times it is dark, I'd have to put this way ahead of the Robin Williams' vehicle, which unlike most critics and viewers, I also loved.Despite being nearly 20 years old, this film speaks to very timely events and debates ongoing vigorously these modern days.  Not only in the social and political realm of many folk's belief that basic health care should be looked upon as a RIGHT not a PRIVILEGE (my own view), but in how screwed up this seemingly ""best health care system in the world"" was, and still is, so many years later.  And how it fails not only the poor (and uninsured), but can also disappoint even wealthy doctors and surgeons, who any day could, can, and do find themselves suddenly a ""patient.""  Indeed, it is this idea of a rather cold and aloof and unsympathetic, ""doctor"" getting a view from the other side (that of a patient) and how it transforms his perspective into a much more humanistic and understanding point of view, which is this film's ultimate charm and importance.There is a definite reason above all possible others, why this movie gets a virtually unanimous 5 star rating on Amazon and which I am happy to add my humble 2 cents review to the general consensus.  This flick is just plain wonderful, with unexpected and humorous/poignant moments all along, and is believable throughout.  The script, direction, acting, production values, and music, are all top notch.  It is extremely interesting and compelling from minute one to the end credits, and I think only someone against a total overhaul of the USA's present health care structure, with the patient coming first and foremost (which hasn't existed for far too long), might not ""get"" this.Unfortunately, for now, it's sad that the very concept of decent, universal and affordable (if not outright free) health care coverage for all, seems to escape most of the right-wing, ""Christian conservative,"" republican ""minority"" in D.C., and on the airwaves (especially radio).  And all the people out there who've apparently fallen prey to their lies and resulting irrational and untenable appeals to fears unfounded.  I suggest this film to this latter group most, even if it may fly way above their heads, and materialistic/capitalist spirit.  Because in my opinion, most if not all of them need to see this more than any anyone else.  Although realistically, I think most of these wingnuts may be beyond redemption in their thinking, and in essence, their very humanity, I hope.  I hope I am wrong about this, but real health reform as I write this, seems an almost impossible dream, due mainly I think to the continually effective ""sales"" disinformation campaign waged for decades by the big pharma's and their lobbies and their ilk, and those goshdarn wonderful FOR-PROFIT ""insurance companies"" and ""hospitals"" out there.  If such thinking is the disease of logic and empathy I believe it to be, I wish this movie, could at least open closed minds, be part of the cure, and would turn the needed popular tide in the, in point of fact, one-sided ""health care debate"" this sadly, still topical film deals with.Based upon the true story, autobiographical book ""A Taste Of My Own Medicine,"" by Edward Rosenbaum, M.D., William Hurt gives an astonishing portrayal of our main protagonist, ""Jack.""  His transformation from arrogant ""doctor"" to unpretentious and enlightened ""patient,"" though a bit slow in coming, is really convincing.  Christine Lahti as his long-suffering wife, ""Anne,"" is excellent as well.  But the real star here is the never-disappointing Elizabeth Perkins as the cancer patient whose experiences and plight help teach Dr. Jack an invaluable and eternal lesson.  Various people Jack meets along the way, are all finely played and very believable as well.  As is this almost unbelievably true story, and this brilliant film adaptation.This is must viewing for anyone who has been on either the ""doctor"" (or health care worker) side, and/or as well the ""patient"" side.  The first group will certainly learn something from this if they haven't already learned it in their profession.  The second group, ""patients,"" or in other words, most of us eventually, we, the majority, the great unwashed masses personally familiar with the corrupt and discriminatory way the whole system can really operate (no pun intended), will only find a confirmation of their experiences, as I did my own in addition to those of loved ones and friends over the years and to this day.  For everyone though, actually, I can boil down the way I feel about this moving, political, but at the same time almost ""spiritually"" humanist and completely satisfying viewing experience, in two words.Must viewing...",5,Must viewing...,1259366400,"11 28, 2009",2009,6306,"['now', 'then', 'will', 'see', 'film', '10', '20', 'years', 'old', 'have', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'first', 'time',

He now must go through the health care meat grinder as merely another patient.  He must deal with his illness, family, colleagues, co-cancer patients, student interns, etc. The possibilities regarding human interaction and interpersonal dynamics in this situation are obviously limitless.A high end cast and set.  William Hurt carries the day with a wonderful performance as said surgeon.  I was impressed also by supporting actors Mandy Patinkin and the understated great talent of Adam Arkin.  I was a little less impressed by female players Elizabeth Perkins and Christine Lahti who I thought were both a little over the top (or maybe that's just me and women).  The San Francisco backdrop is beautiful, as always.  Well written and directed as well.I would share an observation that caused me to ponder a bit ---- Perhaps I'm just a simple Midwesterner living here in flyover country --- but in the circles I travel in, life-threatening illness always involves appeal to the attention, mercy and resources of God (the ""Great Physician"" if you will). That aspect was absent in this film.  Except for one ambiguous ""thank God"" utterance, the divine help was not mentioned or alluded to.  One would think that SOMEBODY in the film would have at least a modicum of religious conviction.Entertaining and well done.  Runs a little over 2 hours.
