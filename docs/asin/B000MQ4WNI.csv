Batfink and Karate are out to battle every criiminal including their chief nemesis Professor Hugo Agogo. I am enjoying these classic cartoons like there is no tomorrow. Batfink knows how to do battle with criminals who want to get away with every crime they committ but they know they will get caught like there is no tomorrow. They are fun loving cartoons like the day they were first shown on television. I used to watch Batfink on WNYS Channel 9 in Syracuse, NY. They used to have this and then the Three Stooges would come on afterwords. They are fun cartoons to watch almost anytime of the week. Batfink is a superhero who always gets the bad guy ready for the police to pick up.",5,Batfink and Karate are out to do battle with the craziest criminals who will do anything to outsmart them.,1368403200,"05 13, 2013",2013,758,"['was', 'part', 'gerowing', 'up', 'remember', 'cartoons', 'very', 'well', 'Batfink', 'Karate', 'are', 'battle', 'criiminal', 'including', 'chief', 'nemesis', 'Professor', 'Hugo', 'Agogo', 'am', 'enjoying', 'classic', 'cartoons', 'tomorrow', 'Batfink', 'how', 'do', 'battle', 'criminals', 'who', 'want', 'get', 'away', 'crime', 'committ', 'know', 'will', 'get', 'caught', 'tomorrow', 'are', 'fun', 'loving', 'cartoons', 'day', 'were', 'first', 'shown', 'television', 'used', 'watch', 'Batfink', 'WNYS', 'Channel', '9', 'Syracuse', 'NY', 'used', 'have', 'then', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'would', 'come', 'afterwords', 'are', 'fun', 'cartoons', 'watch', 'almost', 'anytime', 'week', 'Batfink', 'superhero', 'who', 'always', 'bad', 'guy', 'ready', 'police', 'pick', 'up']",Batfink: The Complete Series

1048884,A3TISHGXRLMTTV,B000MQ4WNI,Patrick Correa,"[0, 0]","I have to rank this up there with Danger Mouse as one of the funniest cartoons ever.  Remember the Nickelodeon show Weinerville?  It was a show about a guy named Mark Weiner who interacted with puppets, most of whom had real heads.  It was pretty funny, especially the Barney parody Boney, a dinosaur skeleton who hates kids.  But my favorite part was when they showed a cartoon towards the end.  They started off with the original Alvin & The Chipmunks cartoon.  Let me just say that while I liked it as a kid, the only part I still like is the episodes with Clyde Crashcup.  I have to admit that whenever he interacts with the Chipmunks themselves its funny too.  But then they stopped showing Alvin thank goodness & replaced it with this.  I instantly loved it.  I could not get enough of Batfink & Karate fighting Hugo A Go-Go and various other villains.  I always thought his steel wings were really cool.  One of the most disappointing moments of my childhood TV was when Batfink was replaced with the similar funny animal superhero cartoon Courageous Cat & Minute Mouse.  Now don&#8217;t get me wrong that was not a bad cartoon.  In fact, it was good and much better than Alvin & The Chipmunks but it still wasn&#8217;t Batfink.  But now I have it on DVD & can watch it whenever I want.Amazingly, it&#8217;s as good as I remember it.  This is just great campy fun.  Like Danger Mouse, the laughs are constant and great, while never feeling mean-spirited.  I especially love the punny names of some of the villains, like the Superman-parody Stupid Man & the mad bomber Napoleon Blownapart.  But my favorite villain will always be Hugo A Gogo.  I have to admit, he&#8217;s a much better arch-nemesis than Baron Greenback from Danger Mouse.  He doesn&#8217;t need henchman to play off of in order to be funny, he IS funny.  Like I said, Batfink is my favorite funny animal superhero next to Danger Mouse & he is by far the best one to come out of the 60s.  Underdog and the aforementioned Courageous Cat & Minute Mouse were good, but Batfink was always the best, particularly because I really cared about the characters.  The cliffhangers on Underdog never bothered me, but those moments where the Batfink Narrator paused the action to make jokes were just unbearable back in the day.  Of course now they&#8217;re one of my favorite parts because the Narrator makes especially funny jokes during them & you know Batfink&#8217;s going to be alright, but when you&#8217;re a kid you don&#8217;t know that.  Oh yeah, that&#8217;s another point in Batfink&#8217;s favor, the Narrator.  One of the problems with Underdog is that the Narrator is too serious.  If you&#8217;re going to be a comedy and you have a Narrator, it should be a funny one.  Batfink&#8217;s Narrator isn&#8217;t as good as Isenbaed in Danger Mouse, but any interactive narrator is good and he offers more laughs in any single episode than Underdog&#8217;s Narrator does in the whole show.  And to top it off, Batfink even has an origin story.  It&#8217;s only revealed in the last episode, and it doesn&#8217;t answer every question but it&#8217;s more than Underdog got.  I recommend this to anyone who likes comedy cartoons.  I must admit you should probably try it before buying because it&#8217;s probably not for everyone.  But if you like campy fun, you will love it.  The only bad thing about the DVD is that it is missing the theme song.  I will admit that it&#8217;s not as memorable as Underdog&#8217;s theme song but it was still pretty cool.  Otherwise, this is fantastic.",5,&#8220;My super-sonic sonar radar will help me!&#8221;,1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,3556,"['have', 'rank', 'there', 'Danger', 'Mouse', 'one', 'funniest', 'cartoons', 'ever', 'Remember', 'Nickelodeon', 'show', 'Weinerville', 'was', 'show', 'guy', 'named', 'Mark', 'Weiner', 'who', 'interacted', 'puppets', 'most', 'whom', 'had', 'real', 'heads', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'especially', 'Barney', 'parody', 'Boney', 'dinosaur', 'skeleton', 'who', 'kids', 'favorite', 'part', 'was', 'when', 'showed', 'cartoon', 'end', 'started', 'off', 'original', 'Alvin', 'Chipmunks', 'cartoon', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'liked', 'kid', 'only', 'part', 'still', 'like', 'episodes', 'Clyde', 'Crashcup', 'have', 'admit', 'whenever', 'Chipmunks', 'funny', 'too', 'then', 'stopped', 'showing', 'Alvin', 'thank', 'goodness', 'replaced', 'instantly', 'loved', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'Batfink', 'Karate', 'fighting', 'Hugo', 'A', 'Go-Go', 'various', 'other', 'villains', 'always', 'thought', 'steel', 'wings', 'were', 'really', 'cool', 'One', 'most', 'disappointing', 'moments', 'childhood', 'TV', 'was', 'when', 'Batfink', 'was', 'replaced', 'similar', 'funny', 'animal', 'superhero', 'cartoon', 'Courageous', 'Cat', 'Minute', 'Mouse', 'Now', 'don', '8217', 'get', 'wrong', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'cartoon', 'fact', 'was', 'good', 'much', 'better', 'Alvin', 'Chipmunks', 'still', '8217', 'Batfink', 'now', 'have', 'DVD', 'can', 'watch', 'whenever', 'want.Amazingly', '8217', 'as', 'good', 'remember', 'just', 'great', 'campy', 'fun', 'Danger', 'Mouse', 'laughs', 'are', 'constant', 'great', 'never', 'feeling', 'mean-spirited', 'especially', 'love', 'punny', 'names', 'villains', 'Superman-parody', 'Stupid', 'Man', 'mad', 'bomber', 'Napoleon', 'Blownapart', 'favorite', 'villain', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'Hugo', 'Gogo', 'have', 'admit', '8217', 's', 'much', 'better', 'arch-nemesis', 'Baron', 'Greenback', 'Danger', 'Mouse', '8217', 'need', 'henchman', 'play', 'off', 'order', 'be', 'funny', 'funny', 'said', 'Batfink', 'favorite', 'funny', 'animal', 'superhero', 'Danger', 'Mouse', 'far', 'best', 'one', 'come', '60s', 'Underdog', 'aforementioned', 'Courageous', 'Cat', 'Minute', 'Mouse', 'were', 'good', 'Batfink', 'was', 'always', 'best', 'particularly', 'really', 'cared', 'characters', 'cliffhangers', 'Underdog', 'never', 'bothered', 'moments', 'where', 'Batfink', 'Narrator', 'paused', 'action', 'make', 'jokes', 'were', 'just', 'unbearable', 'back', 'day', 'course', 'now', '8217', 're', 'one', 'favorite', 'parts', 'Narrator', 'especially', 'funny', 'jokes', 'know', 'Batfink', '8217', 'going', 'be', 'alright', 'when', '8217', 're', 'kid', 'don', '8217', 'know', 'Oh', 'yeah', '8217', 's', 'point', 'Batfink', '8217', 'favor', 'Narrator', 'One', 'problems', 'Underdog', 'Narrator', 'too', 'serious', '8217', 're', 'going', 'be', 'comedy', 'have', 'Narrator', 'should', 'be', 'funny', 'one', 'Batfink', '8217', 'Narrator', 'isn', '8217', 'as', 'good', 'Isenbaed', 'Danger', 'Mouse', 'interactive', 'narrator', 'good', 'more', 'laughs', 'single', 'episode', 'Underdog', '8217', 's', 'Narrator', 'whole', 'show', 'top', 'off', 'Batfink', 'even', 'origin', 'story', '8217', 'only', 'revealed', 'last', 'episode', '8217', 'answer', 'question', '8217', 'more', 'Underdog', 'got', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'comedy', 'cartoons', 'must', 'admit', 'should', 'probably', 'try', 'buying', '8217', 's', 'probably', 'not', 'everyone', 'like', 'campy', 'fun', 'will', 'love', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'DVD', 'missing', 'theme', 'song', 'will', 'admit', '8217', 'not', 'as', 'memorable', 'Underdog', '8217', 's', 'theme', 'song', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Otherwise', 'fantastic']",Batfink: The Complete Series
1048885,A34MWK16CNJAVN,B000MQ4WNI,"Quality Man ""QM""","[7, 8]","I remember watching this show in the early 70's in black and white as a kid. Great to now see it in color, and in great quality.Sound and picture quality is great, viewed on an 86cm plasma.Would've given it 5 stars, but I'm a bit dissapointed with how they've re-edited the opener.I remember it started off with Karate and Batfink in the Batalac coming out of a cave. The theme song (which was sung) started like ""The Batalac is ready is a wonder car...etc"". This is not there. No singing opening. It's all cut with different music and shortened. It's such a real shame as I thought I was getting the classic Batfink shows. Why did they do this? I was really looking forward to it.A friend told me that the real opening is on YouTube. I checked it out and it's there. See it for yourself. This is what I was expecting to see on the DVD. The show, as it was.The menu actually features the real opening music that was at the end of the theme song that was over the title of the episode.I think each cartoon goes for about 6 minutes. I'm not sure because the disc doesn't display any time or chapter details(really weird), and I timed it with a watch without a second hand.Nice packaging but I find the discs are always displaced when I open the case. (Two discs per 'soft thin' case, so they are very close together. Just be careful that one of the discs doesn't drop out. Easy to do.)I'm still glad I purchased this DVD because of the show that I loved long ago.

I know it sounds stupid, but we were kids.We didn't have jobs, we didn't have to pay rent our go to work yet.  Our biggest problems were homework and waiting for Christmas to come.  That's probable one of the 'biggest' reasons for retro shows like this continuing to have a small, yet fanatically loyal fan-base.  They remind us of simpler times.By the way, I purchased this 'new' from a second party vendor on this site, not Amazon like I normally do.
