For example, I would have liked to see Leslie Gore sing ""It's My Party"" or one of her more known songs.  It also would have been good to have her sing more than one song.  The intro of the acts could also have used more build-up and background.  I have the Time-Life DooWop DVD's and Jerry Butler does a great job of that.  I was also expecting to hear Gary Puckett sing, but he only appeared briefly as a host.  Not exacly what I expected when I ordered this video.",3,Enjoyable but . . .,1138579200,"01 30, 2006",2006,569,"['was', 'enjoyable', 'DVD', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'song', 'selection', 'acts', 'example', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'Leslie', 'Gore', 'sing', 'My', 'Party', 'one', 'more', 'known', 'songs', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'have', 'sing', 'more', 'one', 'song', 'intro', 'acts', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'build-up', 'background', 'have', 'Time-Life', 'DooWop', 'DVD', 'Jerry', 'Butler', 'great', 'job', 'was', 'also', 'expecting', 'hear', 'Gary', 'Puckett', 'sing', 'only', 'appeared', 'briefly', 'host', 'Not', 'exacly', 'what', 'expected', 'when', 'ordered', 'video']",N/A

Glad to see that I was very wrong about that. As it turns out, 'Rock & Roll At 50' is quite entertaining to watch. Many very good / well produced performances by the likes of Bo Diddley, playing his namesake ""Bo Diddley"", Jerry Lee Lewis, with ""Whole Lot Of Shakin' Going On"", Brian Hyland - ""Sealed With A Kiss"", Gerry Marsden (of Gerry & The Pacemakers) doing two of his gems, ""Don't Let The Sun Catch You Crying"" and ""Ferry Cross The Mersey"", one time hit maker Paul & Paula with ""Hey Paula"", The Manfreds playing ""Do Wah Diddy Diddy"", pajama pop idol Lesley Gore giving us ""Maybe I Know"" (looking good at 59, Lesley) and Darlene Love (of the Crystals) with ""He's A Rebel"". Those are just the highlights. Total of 22 songs.

Except for the part in England (they don't how to do R & R), it was very enjoyable & entertaining & how about the remaining Flamingos? It is sad that that the early rockers (Jerry Lee Lewis & Bo Diddley)  weren't given more time (most likely they were edited out) as they WERE Rock & Roll. The cover lists the songs (23) that were played. It is a nice stroll down memory lane, but it still wasn't the same as in the 50's.; but then, what is?  So many of our R & R artists were gone when this show was put together such as: Bill Haley & many of his Comets; Carl Perkins, Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, LaVern Baker. The quality of this DVD is good & it will help to make a collection of times gone by when the music was loud & fun, using real instruments, unlike the noise that is being blasted at us nowadays.  +JMJ+",5,Are you getting old?,1325548800,"01 3, 2012",2012,911,"['Most', 'songs', 'artists', 'were', 'good', 'considering', 'people', 'are', 'getting', 'up', 'there', 'age', 'part', 'England', 'do', ""n't"", 'how', 'do', 'R', 'R', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'how', 'remaining', 'Flamingos', 'sad', 'early', 'rockers', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'Bo', 'Diddley', 'were', ""n't"", 'given', 'more', 'time', 'most', 'likely', 'were', 'edited', 'out', 'WERE', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'cover', 'songs', '23', 'were', 'played', 'nice', 'stroll', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'same', '50', 'then', 'what', 'So', 'many', 'R', 'R', 'artists', 'were', 'gone', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'such', 'Bill', 'Haley', 'many', 'Comets', 'Carl', 'Perkins', 'Gene', 'Vincent', 'Eddie', 'Cochran', 'LaVern', 'Baker', 'quality', 'DVD', 'good', 'will', 'help', 'make', 'collection', 'times', 'gone', 'when', 'music', 'was', 'loud', 'fun', 'using', 'real', 'instruments', 'noise', 'being', 'blasted', 'nowadays', '+JMJ+']",N/A
