This time the two are in the red-light district in Paris. Maclaine plays Irma, aka Irma La Douce (meaning Irma the sweet) and Lemmon as an honest cop Nester Patou. As soon as Nester (Lemmon) sets his eyes on Irma he's taken away by her,but, he doesn't realize she's a &quot;working girl&quot;. After being fired off the force for a hotel raid and arresting the chief of police Nester depressed walks into a bar owned by Lou Jacobi who play Moustache. Noticing that Irma's pimp is acting rough with her Nester decides to defend her by getting beat up by her pimp lol. Finally Nester gets the best of him, and finds that now he is Irma's new pimp. Nester finds that he has also fallen in love with her and doesn't want her to be with other men. He then gets a great idea that will enable her to only be with him. As one might expect since the two worked with each other 3 years earlier there is good timing between Lemmon and Maclaine. And Billy Wilder is in fine form. There are some great moment here, especially in the begining when we see Irma conning men into giving her a big tip. And the scenes with Jacobi and Lemmon are very funny as well. The film is based on Alexandre Breffort's play and was written for screen by I.A.L Diamond and Wilder himself. The movie was nominated for 3 Oscars; Best Actress, Cinematograpgy, and Music score. Wonderful film with lots of laughs!p.s Jacobi's last line &quot;Well, that another story! might make some think Wilder was going for the same type of ending he had for another film of his &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; in whinch Joe Brown says &quot;Nobody's perfect&quot;!",3,Great For A Laugh!,985737600,"03 28, 2001",2001,1757,"['Many', 'might', 'want', 'compare', 'film', 'Wilder', 'earlier', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'film', 'quot', 'Apartment', 'quot', 'also', 'starred', 'Lemmon', 'Maclaine', 'time', 'two', 'are', 'red-light', 'district', 'Paris', 'Maclaine', 'Irma', 'aka', 'Irma', 'La', 'Douce', 'meaning', 'Irma', 'sweet', 'Lemmon', 'honest', 'cop', 'Nester', 'Patou', 'As', 'soon', 'Nester', 'Lemmon', 'eyes', 'Irma', 'taken', 'away', ""n't"", 'realize', 'quot', 'working', 'girl', 'quot', 'being', 'fired', 'off', 'force', 'hotel', 'raid', 'arresting', 'chief', 'police', 'Nester', 'depressed', 'walks', 'bar', 'owned', 'Lou', 'Jacobi', 'who', 'play', 'Moustache', 'Noticing', 'Irma', 'pimp', 'acting', 'rough', 'Nester', 'defend', 'getting', 'beat', 'up', 'pimp', 'lol', 'Finally', 'Nester', 'best', 'now', 'Irma', 'new', 'pimp', 'Nester', 'also', 'fallen', 'love', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'other', 'men', 'then', 'great', 'idea', 'will', 'enable', 'only', 'be', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'two', 'worked', 'other', '3', 'years', 'earlier', 'good', 'timing', 'Lemmon', 'Maclaine', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'fine', 'form', 'are', 'great', 'moment', 'here', 'especially', 'begining', 'when', 'see', 'Irma', 'conning', 'men', 'giving', 'big', 'tip', 'scenes', 'Jacobi', 'Lemmon', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'well', 'film', 'based', 'Alexandre', 'Breffort', 'play', 'was', 'written', 'screen', 'I.A.L', 'Diamond', 'Wilder', 'movie', 'was', 'nominated', '3', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Cinematograpgy', 'Music', 'score', 'Wonderful', 'film', 'lots', 'laughs', 'p.s', 'Jacobi', 'last', 'line', 'quot', 'Well', 'story', 'might', 'make', 'think', 'Wilder', 'was', 'going', 'same', 'type', 'ending', 'had', 'film', 'quot', 'Hot', 'quot', 'whinch', 'Joe', 'Brown', 'quot', 'Nobody', 'perfect', 'quot']",Irma La Douce VHS
427204,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304508484,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","Yet another Billy Wilder smash hit, `Irma La Douce' pits the wonderfully charming Shirley MacLaine against the hilariously witty Jack Lemmon in a comedy that is every bit as smart as it is unforgettable.  This is one of those comedies that sneaks up on you, getting better and better as the film progresses onward to its end, and then the ending is one that takes you for a loop and makes you reevaluate your whole understanding of the film.It's just wonderfully constructed from beginning to end.The film tells the story of Nestor Patou, a policeman in Paris who happens to take the law seriously.  Unluckily for Nestor, he's the only law-abiding citizen in his district, and when his clean and polished ways rub the police chief the wrong way he finds himself without a job.  After a chance encounter with a young street walker named Irma and her pimp leaves him the talk of the town though, Nestor finds that the law may not be his friend, but his new life seems to fit him just perfect.  That is until his emotional attachment to Irma gets in the way of her line of work, and soon he finds himself battling with her every step of the way.`Irma La Douce' is a genuine comedy that is sweet and engaging despite its questionable subject matter.  This is never played in a perverse way but used as light fun for the audience.  As we watch Nestor try his hardest to keep Irma from `working' we fall in love with his efforts, for his care for her is genuine and sincere.  As we watch their relationship totter because of his loving deceit we feel for them both because we want them to stay together.The acting is superb here, especially on the parts of the two leads.  Lemmon and MacLaine have proven they are outstanding together (just watch them melt together in Wilder's equally marvelous `The Apartment') and here they take that chemistry to new heights, finding a beautiful balance between adoration and commitment.  This is seen in the wonderful scenes with Irma and Lord X (Nestor's alter ego).  There is such warmth present in those scenes as we witness Irma and Nestor growing closer by means of a medium.This is not Wilder's best work, but it is yet another slam dunk in my opinion.  It's witty and fresh (thank god they cut the stage musicals singing routines) and it is entertaining to the very end.  It will leave you guessing and keep you hooked, and in the end will have you wanting to take the ride all over again.",5,I've fallen head over heals for Irma...,1221523200,"09 16, 2008",2008,2428,"['Yet', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'smash', 'hit', 'Irma', 'La', 'Douce', 'wonderfully', 'charming', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'hilariously', 'witty', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'comedy', 'bit', 'as', 'smart', 'unforgettable', 'one', 'comedies', 'sneaks', 'up', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'film', 'onward', 'end', 'then', 'ending', 'one', 'loop', 'reevaluate', 'whole', 'understanding', 'film.It', 'just', 'wonderfully', 'constructed', 'beginning', 'end.The', 'film', 'story', 'Nestor', 'Patou', 'policeman', 'Paris', 'who', 'take', 'law', 'seriously', 'Unluckily', 'Nestor', 'only', 'law-abiding', 'citizen', 'district', 'when', 'clean', 'polished', 'ways', 'rub', 'police', 'chief', 'wrong', 'way', 'job', 'chance', 'encounter', 'young', 'street', 'walker', 'named', 'Irma', 'pimp', 'talk', 'town', 'Nestor', 'law', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'friend', 'new', 'life', 'fit', 'just', 'perfect', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'Irma', 'way', 'line', 'work', 'soon', 'battling', 'step', 'way.', 'Irma', 'La', 'Douce', 'genuine', 'comedy', 'sweet', 'engaging', 'questionable', 'subject', 'matter', 'never', 'played', 'perverse', 'way', 'used', 'light', 'fun', 'audience', 'watch', 'Nestor', 'try', 'hardest', 'keep', 'Irma', 'working', 'fall', 'love', 'efforts', 'care', 'genuine', 'sincere', 'watch', 'relationship', 'totter', 'loving', 'deceit', 'feel', 'want', 'stay', 'together.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'here', 'especially', 'parts', 'two', 'leads', 'Lemmon', 'MacLaine', 'have', 'proven', 'are', 'outstanding', 'together', 'just', 'watch', 'melt', 'together', 'Wilder', 'equally', 'marvelous', 'Apartment', 'here', 'take', 'chemistry', 'new', 'heights', 'finding', 'beautiful', 'balance', 'adoration', 'commitment', 'seen', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'Irma', 'Lord', 'X', 'Nestor', 'alter', 'ego', 'such', 'warmth', 'present', 'scenes', 'witness', 'Irma', 'Nestor', 'growing', 'closer', 'means', 'medium.This', 'not', 'Wilder', 'best', 'work', 'yet', 'slam', 'dunk', 'opinion', 'witty', 'fresh', 'thank', 'god', 'cut', 'stage', 'musicals', 'singing', 'routines', 'entertaining', 'very', 'end', 'will', 'leave', 'guessing', 'keep', 'hooked', 'end', 'will', 'have', 'wanting', 'take', 'ride', 'all', 'over', 'again']",Irma La Douce VHS
427205,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6304508484,Byron Kolln,"[27, 28]","Billy Wilder's 1963 adaptation of the successful stage musical IRMA LA DOUCE still makes for an entertaining movie experience.  Shirley MacLaine is simply perfect for the title role with Jack Lemmon absolutely hilarious as her comical suitor.Irma la Douce (Shirley MacLaine) plies her trade on the Rue Casanova of Paris with her fellow lovelies (with such names as Lolita, Amazon Annie, Mimi the MauMau and Suzette Wong).  Into Irma's life comes the noble and honest policeman Nestor (Jack Lemmon) who is soon kicked off the job because he refuses to take bribes and compromise his own conscience.  Nestor goes to live with Irma as her `business manager' but wants her to give up her profession, so he `invents' the filthy-rich Lord X to become her sole client, and takes a night-job to help the shortfall.  All manner of hilarious complications ensue as Nestor's double life soon begins to spin out of control!Based on the successful stage musical (music by Marguerite Monnot, lyrics by Alexandre Breffort), IRMA LA DOUCE was re-tooled by Wilder as a straight comedy piece.  It works quite well either way, though I must confess that as an admirer of the stage play, it would have been smashing for Shirley MacLaine to perform that gorgeous score.  The movie does retain the jaunty ""Dis-donc, Dis-donc"" and Andre Previn's score makes good use out of Monnot's music, particularly ""Our Language of Love"".The strong cast also includes Lou Jacobi as the owner of the Bistro Moustache, Bruce Yarnell as Irma's previous manager Hippolyte and Billy Wilder stalwart Joan Shawlee as Amazon Annie.The evocative costumes were designed by Orry-Kelly and the unbilled narrator at the beginning of the film is none other than Louis Jourdan.  Shirley MacLaine was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance here and the movie itself was one of the year's top-grossers.The DVD presents the movie in a nicely-letterboxed 16:9 print.  Colours are full and rich and the soundtrack is stridant in 2-channel stereo.

427209,A2TJWNRBBU82FQ,6304508484,Cowboy Buddha,"[10, 14]","Irma La Douce is a curious film with a curious history. Originally a French musical, it was translated and tranferred to Broadway where it was a modest success. Hollywood liked the play's premise but not its songs so, when Billy Wilder came to make the film version, all the songs were dropped and it was done as a comedy (although some of the music was reworked by Andre Previn as themes for his background score).The story is the stuff of farce. Jack Lemmon is a too honest policeman who gets fired for being overly zealous. He promptly falls in love with the cause of his misfortune - a prostitute played by Shirley MacLaine. Almost by accident, Lemmon becomes her pimp but he is so in love with her that he resents her clients. So he devises a scheme in which he impersonates a rich English lord who buys all of Irma's time. To pay for this, Lemmon must work all day while MacLaine sleeps. Before long, crazy with exhaustion and jealous of himself, he decides to do away with his alter ego. At which point he is arrested for the murder of someone who does not exist.Amazingly, the film is not as funny as it might sound. Or, at least, it's not as funny as it might have been forty years ago. When it was released, Irma La Douce was quite a racy film. But now it seems rather tame and almost naive. And at nearly two and a half hours, there seems to be quite long gaps between highlights. It is probably a sacrilege to suggest Billy Wilder was slightly lacking his trademark golden touch. But much of the style and pacing of the film seems uncertain. The colors are so garish and unreal that you wonder if black and white might have suited the material better. The main sets are obvious sound stages yet the camera occasionally wanders into realistic locations, further confusing the look of the movie. And some more editing would have helped the film's pace.Even so, there are a number of fun moments. Lemmon is always watchable, especially in the days before he began to take himself too seriously. His character of Nestor is right up there with some of his best. But his impersonation of the English lord is so broad and such a caricature that it blunts the intended humor. As Irma, Shirley MacLaine is bubbly and strangely sexy - just as she was in a whole series of silly films in the Sixties. Legend has it that she researched her role by hanging out with real Parisian prostitutes. She needn't have bothered as her Irma is the typical Hollywood tart with a heart of gold. The supporting cast - especially the girls - do their bits well enough. Trivia lovers will enjoy spotting a pre-Incredible Hulk Bill Bixby as a French sailor. Lou Jacobi, as the owner of the local bistro, gets most of the film's best lines. But that's another story...Irma La Douce is an enjoyable enough comedy but everyone involved has done better work elsewhere. Still, it's a lot better than most of the more modern and allegedly more sophisticated ""romantic comedies"" made these days.",3,"Sweet Irma from Paris, Hollywood",1093996800,"09 1, 2004",2004,2971,"['Irma', 'La', 'Douce', 'curious', 'film', 'curious', 'history', 'Originally', 'French', 'musical', 'was', 'translated', 'tranferred', 'Broadway', 'where', 'was', 'modest', 'success', 'Hollywood', 'liked', 'play', 'premise', 'not', 'songs', 'so', 'when', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'came', 'make', 'film', 'version', 'songs', 'were', 'dropped', 'was', 'done', 'comedy', 'music', 'was', 'reworked', 'Andre', 'Previn', 'themes', 'background', 'score', '.The', 'story', 'stuff', 'farce', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'too', 'honest', 'policeman', 'who', 'fired', 'being', 'overly', 'zealous', 'promptly', 'love', 'cause', 'misfortune', 'prostitute', 'played', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Almost', 'accident', 'Lemmon', 'pimp', 'so', 'love', 'clients', 'scheme', 'rich', 'English', 'lord', 'who', 'Irma', 'time', 'pay', 'Lemmon', 'must', 'work', 'day', 'MacLaine', 'sleeps', 'long', 'crazy', 'exhaustion', 'jealous', 'do', 'away', 'alter', 'ego', 'point', 'arrested', 'murder', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'exist.Amazingly', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'might', 'sound', 'least', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'When', 'was', 'released', 'Irma', 'La', 'Douce', 'was', 'quite', 'racy', 'film', 'now', 'rather', 'tame', 'almost', 'naive', 'nearly', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'be', 'quite', 'long', 'gaps', 'highlights', 'probably', 'sacrilege', 'suggest', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'was', 'slightly', 'lacking', 'trademark', 'golden', 'touch', 'much', 'style', 'pacing', 'film', 'uncertain', 'colors', 'are', 'so', 'garish', 'unreal', 'wonder', 'black', 'white', 'might', 'have', 'suited', 'material', 'better', 'main', 'sets', 'are', 'obvious', 'sound', 'stages', 'yet', 'camera', 'occasionally', 'wanders', 'realistic', 'locations', 'further', 'confusing', 'look', 'movie', 'more', 'editing', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'film', 'pace.Even', 'so', 'are', 'number', 'fun', 'moments', 'Lemmon', 'always', 'watchable', 'especially', 'days', 'began', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'character', 'Nestor', 'right', 'best', 'impersonation', 'English', 'lord', 'so', 'broad', 'such', 'caricature', 'intended', 'humor', 'Irma', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'bubbly', 'strangely', 'sexy', 'just', 'was', 'whole', 'series', 'silly', 'films', 'Sixties', 'Legend', 'researched', 'role', 'hanging', 'out', 'real', 'Parisian', 'prostitutes', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'bothered', 'Irma', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'tart', 'heart', 'gold', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'girls', 'do', 'bits', 'well', 'enough', 'Trivia', 'lovers', 'will', 'enjoy', 'spotting', 'pre-Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'French', 'sailor', 'Lou', 'Jacobi', 'owner', 'local', 'bistro', 'most', 'film', 'best', 'lines', 'story', 'Irma', 'La', 'Douce', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'comedy', 'everyone', 'involved', 'done', 'better', 'work', 'elsewhere', 'Still', 'lot', 'better', 'most', 'more', 'modern', 'allegedly', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'made', 'days']",Irma La Douce VHS
427210,A51IK68MWKV5R,6304508484,"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies""","[1, 2]","In an attempt to recapture the magic of The Apartment, director Billy Wilder reassembled the stars of that film, Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, in an adaptation of a popular musical -- and promptly removed the music. The result was Irma La Douce, a film that has been mostly forgotten my modern movie lovers even though it was a huge box-office success in 1963 (earning more than The Great Escape and The Birds combined!).Part of the reason for the obscurity of Irma La Douce may be its highly contrived and mostly unbelievable plot. Jack Lemmon plays Nestor Patou, a Parisian policeman who falls in love with streetwalker Irma La Douce (""Irma the sweet"") after arresting her (and losing his job in the process). Taken by him as well, Irma (MacLaine) takes Nestor on as her live-in ""fellow"" (read: pimp).But Nestor is an insecure, jealous man, and he instantly schemes to replace her customers with a single one of his own -- one rich enough that she won't have to see any others. So he dresses up as ""Lord X"" a British millionaire and spends his nights working several jobs to produce the cash for the role. Then Irma's ex-fellow almost sees Nestor changing from his costume, but thinks he's witnessed a murder....The real appeal of Irma La Douce is in how Lemmon and MacLaine genuinely seem to like each other. One could easily imagine a relationship blossoming between them, and that is the key to believing in these characters.Wilder himself has called the film a ""failure"" (see Conversations with Wilder by Cameron Crowe), mostly due to the fact that his actors, though playing native Parisians, speak with their own accents. But their fans will not care because, though it does not come close to the quality of its predecessor, Irma La Douce is one of Wilder's most purely engaging films, even during the slow spots.

Herein lies my problem with the film.  I liked it, though it was a little overlong, but I was expecting something a little edgier from director Billy Wilder and his co-scenarist I.A.L. Diamond.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that they were adapting someone else's work instead of creating something original.  Lemmon and MacLaine still have that distinct chemistry but it's not as apparent as it was in Wilder's masterwork, ""The Apartment"".  One pronounced credit to the film is the hilarious turn by Lou Jacobi as Moustache, Lemmon's mentor and dispenser of advise.

He doesn't want  her to &quot;work&quot;, but she considers it a profession.  What to do? He  conjures up a rich customer for her (himself in disguise) to keep her  income up and her off the streets.  Jack's character, Nestor, gets in  deeper and deeper as he tries to finance this proposition. Finally,  jealousy (of himself!) takes over.  I don't want to spoil the story for  you!

A Broadway musical made into a straight movie but using all the songs from the Broadway Musical but without the words.This doesn't need to be confusing. Actually it is a delightful movie with two of my favorite actors, Shirley and Jack. Both with exceptional talent from the stage and now adapting this to a non-musical musical romantic comedy. While you hear the background music in this great film you will almost hear the beautiful words being sung with the chemistry that these two actors portray.This comedy duel soon changes to more serious acting as the story progresses and you find yourself just as much in love as they are with each other.
