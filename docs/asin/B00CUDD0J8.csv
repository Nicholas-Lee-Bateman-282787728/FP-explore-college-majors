This particular act brings a curse upon him that all those that die by his gun will return from the dead. Soon, he is hunted by a gang of his undead former victims, led by the vicious Kansa. However, he has another agenda with Kansa..revenge. Aman enlists the help of Fabulos to fight by his side & even the odds.I hate to admit it but, unlike the majority of the reviews on this film, I actually like Gallowwalkers. It reminded me of a spaghetti western of old that takes itself a little more seriously. I know there's alot of people out there who are going to draw comparisons between this film and Snipes' Blade trilogy but, all in all, there's very little to draw comarison to(Snipes hunting down the undead is pretty much it). It's a  decent film with a fair amount of action and, of course, Wesley Snipes stars with a supporting cast of Patrick Bergen, Tanit Phoenix, Riley Smith & Kevin Howarth. Wrestler Diamond Dallas Page also appears in the film.Let's be honest, though, Gallowwalkers has one glaring flaw. That being the plot is all over the place. Twenty minutes into the film, I was-literally- trying to figure out just exactly what it was about. Course, it was resolved by the film's end...but, still, there's no excuse for leaving the viewer totally confused as to what's going on and where the film is headed.Sure, all in all, Gallowwalkers could've been a heck of a sight better.

Thus, i think they depended on a lot of editing and flashbacks to try to make a story that would sell.I am a HUGE Wesley Snipes fan, and was happy to see him back on the map.  Thus, upon seeing his beautiful profile on the cover of a DVD? I rented the movie.But the movie doesn't seem to move forward at a steady pace at all, there's this constant ""piecing together"" by flash-backs to the point, the viewer is basically watching ""scenes"" or ""vignettes""..A lot of it doesn't make sense - but it's great art.  Let's look at one scene of the movie where the slaughter-house kid is in a barren dessert -  and pouring the blood of an animal down into a well. It gets on his legs and shoes.  A startling, deep, rich, contrast against the dry, barren background of drab bleached sand/rocks.  Interesting as art.  Well, think about it.. why in the hell do they have a slaughter house - out in the middle of nowhere?  And where are do they raise the damn cattle?Then the director starts to became quite repetitive with this theme.  In this scene there are a bunch of pale folks with pale hair (wigs), wearing pale clothes - you guessed it! Out in the middle of gawd knows where. Gathered together to hang some other people.  Folks get shot by skinless guy who just put on some chick's face after she was stabbed to death by his co-whore, i mean, co-hort..and out come the purple capes - contrasting against the barren landscape.And yes the director makes good use of blood on sand and other contrasting material from beginning to the end.Regardless of the director's ploy to keep the attention of the audience, or even try to make any sense of the movie at all.  The only redeeming factor of the movie?  Of course is seeing Wesley Snipes.

Not zombies, mind you, but undead people with all the memories and body functions.  The people Snipes kills are bad guys, and as undead-they are worse.  Snipes kills people that raped and killed his lover-but there is more to it than just that.  There is the back story of why Snipes character is...well...cursed.

I only watched this movie because the plot summary from Wiki made it sound cool. I also liked Snipes in US Marshalls from a long long time ago when he made decent movies. This movie was made in Namibia but it looks like it was made cheaply in Death Valley like a lot of Hollywood movies are made when they want the desert scenes. This movie does not look like it has a big budget. The plot summaries from Wikipedia and IMDb are not in sync with the actual movie: ""When a nun broke her covenant with God to save the life of Aman, her unborn son, he was cursed for life. As an adult, Aman (Snipes) has killed those who have crossed him. But his curse brings his victims back to life, and as the undead, they pursue him endlessly for revenge. Forever suffering this curse, Aman enlists Fabulos (Smith), a young gunman, to fight by his side against his undead victims."" I kept waiting and waiting for the nun scene and when it finally happened, it made no sense!! The first 10 minutes of this movie are very good but then it all falls apart. It's like the editor and director randomly edited the film scenes together without any kind of plot in mind.

1651198,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00CUDD0J8,Matthew Scott Baker,"[5, 5]","I've been a Wesley Snipes fan for a long time, going all the way back to 1989 when he portrayed Willie Mays Hayes in MAJOR LEAGUE.  Over the years, he's played a wide variety of characters, both good and bad; I've loved many of these, including Nino Brown from NEW JACK CITY, Simon Phoenix from DEMOLITION MAN, and Blade from the titular film trilogy.  Unfortunately, however, Snipes seems to have hit a very low point in his career, and his involvement with this recent film, GALLOWWALKERS, is a good example of that.  I wanted very badly to like this film, but a messy plot and bad writing kept me from it.I am still a Wesley Snipes fan, although I hope his career does not take a nosedive like Val Kilmer's did several years ago.  Snipes' offscreen troubles with the IRS should not affect his Hollywood status, but his recent film roles seem to indicate otherwise.  Hopefully, a role in THE EXPENDABLES 3 will give his career a much needed boost.GALLOWWALKERS started off with a lot of promise.  On the surface, the plot sounds interesting and could potentially make for an intensity-filled flick.  Also, having an action veteran like Snipes onboard makes it an even greater pull.  There's even the possibility for some excellent carnage in a film like this, which would thrust it into the annals of horror greatness.Yet, the execution of the film falls way flat, and the result is a lackluster movie that is nothing more than a jumbled mess.  The storyline is convoluted and jumpy; I found myself rewinding several times to see if I had missed something.  Nothing is explained outright (you have to make A LOT of assumptions and many of those, for me, were wrong) and the confusion took me out of the film very quickly.The acting in GALLOWWALKERS isn't bad, and the film has some decent gore, although there should have been much more.  I particularly like the use of, as my buddy, fellow-reviewer Hayes Hudson, put it, ""Mortal Kombat-like"" decapitations; these occur when Snipes yanks someone's head off and rips their spine out with it.  Likewise, the film itself is shot well and looks pretty good overall.  But those are the only positives I can mention.GALLOWWALKERS is a big disappointment for me and I can't recommend giving this one a look, unless your fandom for Wesley Snipes can overlook the negatives I've mentioned above.

1651201,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00CUDD0J8,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[0, 0]","""Gallowwalkers"" is the first movie Wesley Snipes released since the end of his prison sentence, after its production was slowed by his incarceration. It is also one very confounding film, though somewhat redeemed by its production values. In a way, it feels like Snipes was trying to revisit the kind of action-horror he had erected with theBlade trilogy, but this here is neither good action nor horror - just an interesting direct-to-video experiment.The story: a gunslinger (Snipes), cursed so that the people he's killed will rise from the dead, engages a gang he murdered for raping his beloved.I'll be honest: I have no real idea what's going on in the movie. At his worst, fellow action hero Steven Seagal's produced some DTV films wherein the motives of the characters are unclear, relationships are ambiguous, and the story is convoluted as heck, but he has never been in a movie as confusing as this one. You can glean that the main zombie-man (Kevin Howarth,The Last Horror Movie) simultaneously wants revenge on Snipes' character while trying to resurrect his staying-dead son, but that's about where it ends. About thirty minutes in, Wesley provides some exposition regarding his character, and with twenty minutes to go you glean that a showdown is going to happen, but that's it. I'm left with basic questions unanswered: ""what is this mysterious sisterhood they keep referencing?"" - ""why was Wesley's character cursed?"" - ""why does he think he needs a sidekick?"" - ""why does Tanit Phoenix (Death Race 2) have such a large role but does nothing throughout the film?""The action is scarce and not very fulfilling, with the only real fight scene being a plodding encounter between Snipes and pro wrestler Diamond Dallas Page. Coupled with the incomprehensible plot, this should have been more than enough for me to rate this movie very low, so I'm surprised by how ultimately watchable the feature actually is. Director Andrew Goth seems to have thrown everything he had into this one's art direction and production values, and the results are some remarkably good cinematography and some great costumes and makeup. The look of the movie is unique -Fist of the North StarmeetsThe Book of Eli- and the acting tends to hold one's attention. Even the gore effects are sort of creative. I would completely understand if others didn't find these parts as compensatory as I did, but unlike during some of Snipes' other low budget fare, I was never bored while watching.A second or third viewing might yet clear up those questions I have regarding the story, but I'm not sure I'll get to that - the movie's good but not great enough to merit repeat screenings. It's not the worst film that Wesley could have kicked off his comeback with, but it's good that he can fall back on ""The Expendables 3"" for now.",3,"""A man might take the news of his own death badly""",1386892800,"12 13, 2013",2013,2810,"['Gallowwalkers', 'first', 'movie', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'released', 'end', 'prison', 'sentence', 'production', 'was', 'slowed', 'incarceration', 'also', 'one', 'very', 'confounding', 'film', 'somewhat', 'redeemed', 'production', 'values', 'way', 'Snipes', 'was', 'trying', 'revisit', 'kind', 'action-horror', 'had', 'erected', 'theBlade', 'trilogy', 'here', 'neither', 'good', 'action', 'horror', 'just', 'interesting', 'direct-to-video', 'experiment.The', 'story', 'gunslinger', 'Snipes', 'cursed', 'so', 'people', 'killed', 'will', 'rise', 'dead', 'gang', 'murdered', 'raping', 'beloved.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'have', 'real', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'movie', 'worst', 'fellow', 'action', 'hero', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'produced', 'DTV', 'films', 'wherein', 'motives', 'characters', 'are', 'unclear', 'relationships', 'are', 'ambiguous', 'story', 'convoluted', 'heck', 'never', 'been', 'movie', 'as', 'confusing', 'one', 'can', 'glean', 'main', 'zombie-man', 'Kevin', 'Howarth', 'Last', 'Horror', 'Movie', 'simultaneously', 'revenge', 'Snipes', 'character', 'trying', 'resurrect', 'staying-dead', 'son', 'where', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'Wesley', 'exposition', 'regarding', 'character', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'go', 'glean', 'showdown', 'going', 'happen', ""'m"", 'left', 'basic', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'what', 'mysterious', 'sisterhood', 'keep', 'referencing', 'why', 'was', 'Wesley', 'character', 'cursed', 'why', 'think', 'sidekick', 'why', 'Tanit', 'Phoenix', 'Death', 'Race', '2', 'have', 'large', 'role', 'nothing', 'film', 'action', 'scarce', 'not', 'very', 'fulfilling', 'only', 'real', 'fight', 'scene', 'being', 'plodding', 'encounter', 'Snipes', 'pro', 'wrestler', 'Diamond', 'Dallas', 'Page', 'Coupled', 'incomprehensible', 'plot', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'enough', 'rate', 'movie', 'very', 'low', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'how', 'ultimately', 'watchable', 'feature', 'actually', 'Director', 'Andrew', 'Goth', 'have', 'thrown', 'everything', 'had', 'one', 'art', 'direction', 'production', 'values', 'results', 'are', 'remarkably', 'good', 'cinematography', 'great', 'costumes', 'makeup', 'look', 'movie', 'unique', '-Fist', 'North', 'StarmeetsThe', 'Book', 'Eli-', 'acting', 'tends', 'hold', 'one', 'attention', 'Even', 'gore', 'effects', 'are', 'sort', 'creative', 'would', 'completely', 'understand', 'others', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'parts', 'as', 'compensatory', 'did', 'Snipes', 'other', 'low', 'budget', 'fare', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'watching.A', 'second', 'third', 'viewing', 'might', 'yet', 'clear', 'questions', 'have', 'regarding', 'story', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'get', 'movie', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'enough', 'merit', 'repeat', 'screenings', 'not', 'worst', 'film', 'Wesley', 'could', 'have', 'kicked', 'off', 'comeback', 'good', 'can', 'fall', 'back', 'Expendables', '3', 'now']",Gallowwalker

Set in the wild west, where people's lives don't mean anything, Aman, a mysterious cowboy- gunman is seeking revenge on five Gallowwalkers who have raped his girlfriend.Review:I found the first ten minutes quite entertaining because it really caught my attention when they talked about a portal between heaven and hell and nuns who guard this portal. But then the story just falls apart, we don't really know what's going on or why things happen the way they do - well, besides Aman's revenge trip. And can we talk about those horrible wigs everyone was wearing?! I mean, I have a better looking synthetic wig at home than what they had to offer - don't ask. They seemed to have used all the budget for the few gore effects that were really nicely done, but besides that the movie doesn't have anything to offer. It's already bad that the story didn't make sense but what's worse is that I really didn't care if it did. I was just glad when the movie was over. This is another proof that many directors shouldn't be writers. It seemed well directed but the script was horrible. Gallowwalkers has apparently been finished a few years ago before Mr. Snipes even went to jail, but I guess they wanted to wait until he gets released, but they should have let it collect dust until the end of time if you ask me. My advice: If you watch the trailer you have basically seen the whole movie and saved 90 minutes of your life. Poor Wesley Snipes, but at least he has the opportunity to be part of the Expendables` Franchise, maybe this will give him the well-deserved comeback.

Oh, my.&#8221; On the other hand, worth noting: the IMDB trivia page for Gallowwalkers notes that the project was originally a Japanese offering starring Yun-fat Chow; one wonders if the disappointed fanboys, myself included, would be singing the movie's praises had it stayed that way. But thinking too far down those lines, well, that way lies madness (or, worse, a desire to bankroll something like the abomination that was Priest); we got what we got, and what we got is a ridiculous, shameless, incoherent dog's dinner of a film that makes me wonder why I am even seeing a headline in the &#8220;related news&#8221; section that says Gallowwalkers sells wide. Having now seen the wretched thing, but not having clicked to read the article, I can't help but wonder if the person who bought wide still has a job at VMI Worldwide. (Well, as of this writing, the movie has yet to open in Peru, so maybe it won't be a total loss.)Aman (see what they did there?) (Blade's Wesley Snipes) is a cursed gunslinger in an alternate-universe American west. We find out early on he's after a gang of outlaws for some reason or other (the &#8220;some reason&#8221; becomes a mildly important plot point, therefore it's a spoiler). He keeps finding lackeys, but he's really looking for the gang's leader, Kansa (The Last Horror Movie's Kevin Howarth). Problem is, the gang are all undead. As such things happen (at least in the movies), Aman reluctantly acquires himself a sidekick in the form of Fabulos (Radio's Riley Smith), an eager young gunslinger who's just looking for some action. Well, he gets it. The end result feels like it was supposed to play out kind of like Django meets Blade......but instead it feels a lot more like Lust in the Dust meets Blade II (and I know there are some people who have some love for Blade II, and, well, I'm sorry for you). There was a great deal of talk back in the day about how this was going to be Wesley Snipes' comeback film. Now, I'm a Wesley Snipes fan from way back, and as a result I've seen a few of the films he's done since fading from the public eye, tripe like The Art of War and Liberty Stands Still and (ugh) Game of Death...and I'm here to tell you that every one of those movies is acres better than Gallowwalkers. This is just terrifying, but not in the sense that the movie is scary&#8212;it's a movie where it seems everything about it was simply the wrong decision. I mean, you make a movie where Yun-fat Chow was originally attached, Wesley Snipes stepped into the role, and there are no martial arts sequences whatsoever. How does that even happen?  And, okay, maybe I'm reading in the Blade-series similarities because of Snipes' involvement, but I don't think that's 100% of what I'm seeing here; Goth and Reay (who were responsible for the 2005 snoozer Cold and Dark previous to this) weren't wearing that particular heart too far away from their sleeves, to the point of giving Howarth a long blond wig (spike that thing out and with the mannerisms his character adopts, he might as well be Stephen Dorff). Now, I am willing to entertain the idea that when Goth and Reay put together the first draft of their script, it might well have been comprehensible. Maybe even good. Interesting characters who did interesting things and didn't simply exist in between action sequences (in other words, more Unforgiven&#8212;another movie this borrows from liberally&#8212;instead of [fill in the Michael Bay movie here]). If that is the case, all the good stuff got &#8220;fixed&#8221; in post.Only for the hardest of hardcore Wesley Snipes fanatics.

I finally figured out when the scene faded to black and something completely different in over-exposure comes up, it was a flashback.  The two plots were intriguing enough (woman asked some Force (the Devil?) to resurrect her son and he complies with the stipulation that whomever the son kills will be resurrected also; Son hunts down the men who raped and impregnated his sweetheart (she dies in childbirth), kills them, then has to keep doing it again and again.)  The fact that the son of the gang leader killed himself out of apparent remorse and the father doesn't realize this and wonders why his son wasn't resurrected, too, could've made a good third subplot but it was barely pursued.The characters have names in the cast list but no one calls anyone by name in the flim so it's difficult to know who's really who, except for Snipes, if course.  Some interesting scenery...dunes, dunes, and more dunes...it was filmed in Nambia.  The fights and killings are bloody, the villain speaks in a hoarse whispery growl and the first sight of him, skinned, waiting for a human flesh covering is good enough. Throw in a pyramidesque fortress in the desert, a group of women sworn to protect it, townspeople who look like albinos, and a sheriff who waylays people and hangs them to &#34;send them to their reward&#34; for extra confusion.There are just too many questions and you have to supply your own answers which may or may not be the right ones.  Why did one of the Undead sew his lips together, then speak through the sutures? What's with the Cardinal-like robes the Undead wear?  What the heck does the names Gallowwalker have to do with anything? None of them are hanged though a good many others are.

A fine bit of upstaging, by the way.)No explanation for the pseudo-religious connotation is explained. Is it allegory or just plain creepiness? This has been described as a future cult movie.

Overall, a movie that wasn't terrible but not good either just really a blah movie. I give it a C.",2,The new Snipes movie. Felt really flat & had no energy or emotion. Nothing offensive but not good either. Very blah.

Being cursed, however, those villains he has killed return from the dead. It&#8217;s much like a typical low-budget western movie set in the alternate Wild West, but the idea of Wesley Snipes fighting a bloody fight against a band of the undead is not bad.Unfortunately, the filmmakers do not know how to tell a story on screen. For anyone who has not read the synopsis, the film would look like a collection of fragmented images that does not make any sense at all. You don&#8217;t know who this &#8220;Aman&#8221; (played by Wesley Snipes) is. You don&#8217;t know why he kills. Never mind, because anyway you stop caring.I know the film&#8217;s troubled filming process, so I know I shouldn&#8217;t be so harsh. Still, I couldn&#8217;t help thinking the only thing worth watching is the beautifully-shot landscapes of the bleak desert (shot in Namibia), the backdrop against which the boring story goes on and on.",1,Mess,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,1001,"['first', 'sight', 'interesting', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'gunslinger', 'out', 'revenge', 'Being', 'cursed', 'however', 'villains', 'killed', 'return', 'dead', '8217', 's', 'much', 'typical', 'low-budget', 'western', 'movie', 'set', 'alternate', 'Wild', 'West', 'idea', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'fighting', 'bloody', 'fight', 'band', 'undead', 'not', 'bad.Unfortunately', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'tell', 'story', 'screen', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'read', 'synopsis', 'film', 'would', 'look', 'collection', 'fragmented', 'images', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'don', '8217', 't', 'know', 'who', '8220', 'Aman', '8221', 'played', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'don', '8217', 't', 'know', 'why', 'Never', 'mind', 'anyway', 'stop', 'caring.I', 'know', 'film', '8217', 'troubled', 'filming', 'process', 'know', 'shouldn', '8217', 'be', 'so', 'harsh', 'Still', 'couldn', '8217', 'help', 'thinking', 'only', 'thing', 'worth', 'watching', 'beautifully-shot', 'landscapes', 'bleak', 'desert', 'shot', 'Namibia', 'backdrop', 'boring', 'story']",Gallowwalker
