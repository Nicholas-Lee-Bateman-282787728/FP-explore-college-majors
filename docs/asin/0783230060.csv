Fox's cap, but The Hard Way is a perfectly entertaining film with plenty of action and more than a few laughs.  The plot certainly doesn't break any new ground, there aren't any real surprises along the way, and the ending definitely qualifies as over-the-top, but the whole thing works pretty darn well - thanks largely to the performances of Fox and James Woods.Michael J. Fox plays box-office sensation Nick Lang, star of The Smoking Gunn movies; he has it all, but he wants more.  He's tired of playing Indiana Jones clones and yearns for a more serious role - such as the part of tough cop Ray Casanov in an upcoming film.  He wants it so badly that, after seeing a television interview with Detective Lt. John Moss (James Woods) of NYPD, he uses his star power clout to get himself riding shotgun with Moss for two weeks in order to prepare himself for the audition.  Moss, as you might imagine, is none too happy about having to baby-sit a movie star he doesn't even like - especially since it takes him off a big case.  The Party Crasher (Stephen Lang) has been killing indiscriminately, and the whole case has become personal for Moss.  The guy calls in his crimes before he commits them, and he's been eyeball to eyeball with Moss, yet he keeps getting away.  Moss is determined to get rid of his new partner ""Ray Casanov"" as soon as possible so that he can get back to the case he considers his own.The new partners get into a number of situations, as you might expect, with Casanov always getting in the way or - worse yet - actually trying to play the part of a real cop.  Moss can't even shake the guy away from work, as Lang tries to spend every moment studying the cop's life firsthand - including Moss' flailing relationship with his girlfriend Susan (Annabella Sciorra).  It's easy to predict how everything will turn out in the end, yet the journey to that ending turns out to be surprisingly entertaining.I'm not sure how successful this film was at the box office - heck, I don't even remember hearing about this film back in 1991.  It's sort of a sleeper, though - the kind of film that appears to be too buried in clich&eacute;s and predictability to really succeed, yet succeed it does.  Maybe it's Woods' intense performance that never crosses the fine line between realism and farce, or Fox's energetic performance as the spoiled actor who really wants to learn the ropes from a cop he genuinely admires (no matter how badly Moss treats him).  Whatever it is, The Hard Way is a surprisingly enjoyable romp of a film.",4,Much more entertaining than I expected,1140220800,"02 18, 2006",2006,2600,"['not', 'one', 'more', 'prominent', 'feathers', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'cap', 'Hard', 'Way', 'perfectly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'plenty', 'action', 'more', 'few', 'laughs', 'plot', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'are', ""n't"", 'real', 'surprises', 'way', 'ending', 'definitely', 'qualifies', 'over-the-top', 'whole', 'thing', 'pretty', 'darn', 'well', 'thanks', 'largely', 'performances', 'Fox', 'James', 'Woods.Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'box-office', 'sensation', 'Nick', 'Lang', 'star', 'Smoking', 'Gunn', 'movies', 'more', 'tired', 'playing', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'clones', 'yearns', 'more', 'serious', 'role', 'such', 'part', 'tough', 'cop', 'Ray', 'Casanov', 'upcoming', 'film', 'so', 'badly', 'seeing', 'television', 'interview', 'Detective', 'Lt.', 'John', 'Moss', 'James', 'Woods', 'NYPD', 'star', 'power', 'clout', 'get', 'riding', 'shotgun', 'Moss', 'two', 'weeks', 'order', 'prepare', 'audition', 'Moss', 'might', 'imagine', 'none', 'too', 'happy', 'having', 'baby-sit', 'movie', 'star', ""n't"", 'even', 'especially', 'off', 'big', 'case', 'Party', 'Crasher', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'been', 'killing', 'indiscriminately', 'whole', 'case', 'become', 'personal', 'Moss', 'guy', 'crimes', 'been', 'eyeball', 'eyeball', 'Moss', 'yet', 'getting', 'away', 'Moss', 'determined', 'get', 'rid', 'new', 'partner', 'Ray', 'Casanov', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'case', 'own.The', 'new', 'partners', 'get', 'number', 'situations', 'might', 'expect', 'Casanov', 'always', 'getting', 'way', 'worse', 'yet', 'actually', 'trying', 'play', 'part', 'real', 'cop', 'Moss', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'shake', 'guy', 'away', 'work', 'Lang', 'spend', 'moment', 'studying', 'cop', 'life', 'firsthand', 'including', 'Moss', 'flailing', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'Susan', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'easy', 'predict', 'how', 'everything', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'end', 'journey', 'ending', 'out', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'successful', 'film', 'was', 'box', 'office', 'heck', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'hearing', 'film', 'back', '1991', 'sort', 'sleeper', 'kind', 'film', 'be', 'too', 'buried', 'clich', 'eacute', 'predictability', 'really', 'succeed', 'yet', 'succeed', 'Maybe', 'Woods', 'intense', 'performance', 'never', 'fine', 'line', 'realism', 'farce', 'Fox', 'energetic', 'performance', 'spoiled', 'actor', 'who', 'really', 'learn', 'ropes', 'cop', 'genuinely', 'matter', 'how', 'badly', 'Moss', 'Hard', 'Way', 'surprisingly', 'enjoyable', 'romp', 'film']",N/A

Ian Crutchley,"[2, 2]","Try to forget about plot and characterisation, and simply sit back and enjoy a good old-fashioned mis-matched buddy movie with the emphasis on laughs.  The ever watchable Woods steals the show as usual, but is given  a close run for his money by Michael J Fox, who gleefully sends-up his  goody-goody image.  Woods himself described his character as 'The most  easily annoyed man in the world', who gets stuck with 'The world's most  annoying man'. And so the scene is set for a series of confrontations  between the mis-matched pair, while on the trail of a serial killer- The  Party Crasher.  Annabella Sciorra provides the token female character,  losing out on the charisma stakes to a young Christina Ricca, as Woods'  girlfriend, but to be honest her scenes seem out of place in what is  otherwise a vehicle for the comedic talents of the two male leads. And when  needed, Woods can be relied on to provide his customary grit to the  proceedings.  True it may be a bit of a 'no-brainer', but the two  leading men spark off each other so well, you will enjoy it anyway.

Ultimately, they got him, but it was a complicated story with a lot of strange twists and turns.The movie was funny. I enjoyed it. The photography and sound were good. The acting was reasonably good, if not a bit overdone here and there. There was a lot of action, with bullets flying, car wrecks and all those things. It was a good story. In the end, both the actor and the real detective learned from one another. I think some of the comedic things were overdone.

I saw this movie 1995 and I loved it. I bought the DVD years later and I still love it. The Hard Way is not only an action comedy but its also a clever one.The story: a pampered and naive movie star Nick Lang(Michael J. Fox) wants to nail a movie part as a serious cop so he gets assigned to become partners with a hard-nosed, no-nonsense cop called John Moss(James Woods). Moss is amped on catching a murderer named ""Party Crasher""(Stephen Lang) and is in no mood to look after a gullible movie star.Looking back at this movie I never realized how much of a character Michael J. Fox was. This guy had personality out the wazoo and you're guaranteed to laugh at his hijinks in this movie. James Woods is always perfect in those tough guy roles and he nails this one as Detective John Moss. His character reminds me of Jack Cates of 48 Hrs. Stephen Lang is good as the nutty villain ""Party Crasher"". He comes across as a total schizo but is smarter than he seems.The humor in this movie is funny whether its Nick's naivete' or Nick showing John to tell Maria(Annabella Sciorra)how he feels about her or John's growing weary of Nick's behavior. This movie is great mix of comedy and action and is one of the most underrated and overlooked buddy comedy of all time.",5,"""bang bang Nick Lang""",1246752000,"07 5, 2009",2009,1409,"['Hard', 'Way', 'Last', 'Action', 'Hero', 'are', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'one', 'aspect', 'show', 'viewer', 'differentiate', 'movies', 'real', 'life', 'saw', 'movie', '1995', 'loved', 'bought', 'DVD', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'love', 'Hard', 'Way', 'not', 'only', 'action', 'comedy', 'also', 'clever', 'one.The', 'story', 'pampered', 'naive', 'movie', 'star', 'Nick', 'Lang', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'nail', 'movie', 'part', 'serious', 'cop', 'assigned', 'become', 'partners', 'hard-nosed', 'no-nonsense', 'cop', 'called', 'John', 'Moss', 'James', 'Woods', 'Moss', 'amped', 'catching', 'murderer', 'named', 'Party', 'Crasher', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'mood', 'look', 'gullible', 'movie', 'star.Looking', 'back', 'movie', 'never', 'realized', 'how', 'much', 'character', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'was', 'guy', 'had', 'personality', 'wazoo', ""'re"", 'guaranteed', 'laugh', 'hijinks', 'movie', 'James', 'Woods', 'always', 'perfect', 'tough', 'guy', 'roles', 'one', 'Detective', 'John', 'Moss', 'character', 'Jack', 'Cates', '48', 'Hrs', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'good', 'nutty', 'villain', 'Party', 'Crasher', 'across', 'total', 'schizo', 'smarter', 'humor', 'movie', 'funny', 'Nick', 'naivete', 'Nick', 'showing', 'John', 'tell', 'Maria', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'how', 'John', 'growing', 'weary', 'Nick', 'behavior', 'movie', 'great', 'mix', 'comedy', 'action', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'overlooked', 'buddy', 'comedy', 'time']",N/A
