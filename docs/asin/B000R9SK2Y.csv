1080687,A1SHNOU2ODKIDG,B000R9SK2Y,Gregorio,"[1, 2]","It would be difficult not to give this film five stars simply because it has such good intentions.  There is a lot to admire in this film.  Schneider proves that he knows how to direct a scene and he gets the most from his amateur cast (Schneider's family and friends fill many of the rolls).  At times the film feels like a very elaborate home movie.  There are a couple of truly humorous scenes and Schneider's mother steels the show in her cameo role.  There are also a lot of technical flaws that take the viewer out of the action. Let's hope that such a lazy approach is not taken in the next film.  Still, this is a lot of fun and I enjoyed it very much.",5,A movie with a good heart,1208908800,"04 23, 2008",2008,660,"['would', 'be', 'difficult', 'not', 'give', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'simply', 'such', 'good', 'intentions', 'lot', 'admire', 'film', 'Schneider', 'how', 'direct', 'scene', 'most', 'amateur', 'cast', 'Schneider', 'family', 'friends', 'fill', 'many', 'rolls', 'times', 'film', 'feels', 'very', 'elaborate', 'home', 'movie', 'are', 'couple', 'truly', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'Schneider', 'mother', 'steels', 'show', 'cameo', 'role', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'technical', 'flaws', 'take', 'viewer', 'action', 'Let', 'hope', 'lazy', 'approach', 'not', 'taken', 'next', 'film', 'Still', 'lot', 'fun', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much']",John Schneider's Collier & Co. -- Hot Pursuit!

I watched it and the quality of film was rubbish. But the movie was good so I decided, based on John Schneider's opening statements to get the ""regular"" dvd. Which he says has all these special features on it. Well I received the movie and the back cover says it is a 2 disc set with loads of special features. But upon opening it I was stunned to find it was actually the same copy as the one I purchased before, with the same lousy picture quality. Now I've wasted money on two copies of this disc. Neither price was that expensive so I'm not complaining about that. I'm upset that the description of the product is not at all what it claims to be. Two different covers with the same low quality movie in it. Even long time fans of his-such as I am would agree this is cheap way to con fans out of extra money.

1080693,A35ZMLELO5TYY7,B000R9SK2Y,"Michelle ""Pondering in Spring""","[0, 0]","I like this movie. It's so different from the CG-loaded sci-fi I usually get. It's obviously meant to follow up or pay homage to Dukes of Hazzard (a show I enjoy!).This DVD has an unusual beginning: John Schneider will thank you for purchasing the DVD, talk about how you can buy it in bulk to resell, and explain that he put the whole thing together as a labor of love, involving his family and friends. It's a fairly good story that opens with John (playing JR Collier) about to hustle someone (would Bo Duke have done that?) and continues with  decent lines, decent funny moments throughout (almost Hazzard style), a little bit of scariness, and some fancy driving on dirt roads. JR drives a Dodge Charger he named Traveler. The sidekick is a version of Cooter put into a big fancy garage. The bad guys are threatening but won't really scare anyone (one good ol' boy wears a Roscoe-esque hat). The special effects are just enough to make a point. Throughout the movie is a family struggle that honestly tugged at my heart. John's acting is great, his wife is charming, their daughter is like the tomboy next door. I think the two cute towheads in the restaurant scene are Schneiders and credit is given to a son working behind the scenes. As other reviewers mentioned, the sound is nothing to brag about. Also the movie is presented in full format rather than widescreen. All-in-all, it gave me the feeling that some cousins whose company I enjoy, but don't get to see very often, have put together this film to entertain anyone who loves the core features of The Dukes of Hazzard.Note: You won't get extras on this DVD, as there is supposedly another out there released several months after this one, but there is a short bloopers track after the movie that features a very funny nod to his role on the TV show Smallville.In case you didn't know, here is a little trivia that will make watching this movie more interesting: Bo Duke was supposedly patterned after Jerry Rushing who ran moonshine in a car he named Traveler before going into stock car racing, and The Dukes of Hazzard was compiled in part by stories Jerry (JR?) told Gy Waldron.",3,Warm-hearted movie that feels like a friend or cousin put together and honors Dukes of Hazzard,1297036800,"02 7, 2011",2011,2147,"['like', 'movie', 'so', 'different', 'CG-loaded', 'sci-fi', 'usually', 'get', 'obviously', 'meant', 'follow', 'up', 'pay', 'homage', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'show', 'enjoy', '.This', 'DVD', 'unusual', 'beginning', 'John', 'Schneider', 'will', 'thank', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'talk', 'how', 'can', 'buy', 'bulk', 'resell', 'explain', 'put', 'whole', 'thing', 'together', 'labor', 'love', 'involving', 'family', 'friends', 'fairly', 'good', 'story', 'John', 'playing', 'JR', 'Collier', 'hustle', 'someone', 'would', 'Bo', 'Duke', 'have', 'done', 'decent', 'lines', 'decent', 'funny', 'moments', 'almost', 'Hazzard', 'style', 'little', 'bit', 'scariness', 'fancy', 'driving', 'dirt', 'roads', 'JR', 'Dodge', 'Charger', 'named', 'Traveler', 'sidekick', 'version', 'Cooter', 'put', 'big', 'fancy', 'garage', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'threatening', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'scare', 'anyone', 'one', 'good', 'ol', 'boy', 'Roscoe-esque', 'hat', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'point', 'movie', 'family', 'struggle', 'honestly', 'tugged', 'heart', 'John', 'acting', 'great', 'wife', 'charming', 'daughter', 'tomboy', 'next', 'door', 'think', 'two', 'cute', 'towheads', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'are', 'Schneiders', 'credit', 'given', 'son', 'working', 'scenes', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mentioned', 'sound', 'nothing', 'brag', 'Also', 'movie', 'presented', 'full', 'format', 'rather', 'widescreen', 'All-in-all', 'gave', 'feeling', 'cousins', 'company', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'very', 'often', 'have', 'put', 'together', 'film', 'entertain', 'anyone', 'who', 'core', 'features', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard.Note', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'extras', 'DVD', 'supposedly', 'there', 'released', 'several', 'months', 'one', 'short', 'bloopers', 'track', 'movie', 'very', 'funny', 'nod', 'role', 'TV', 'show', 'Smallville.In', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'here', 'little', 'trivia', 'will', 'make', 'watching', 'movie', 'more', 'interesting', 'Bo', 'Duke', 'was', 'supposedly', 'patterned', 'Jerry', 'Rushing', 'who', 'ran', 'moonshine', 'car', 'named', 'Traveler', 'going', 'stock', 'car', 'racing', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'was', 'compiled', 'part', 'stories', 'Jerry', 'JR', 'told', 'Gy', 'Waldron']",John Schneider's Collier & Co. -- Hot Pursuit!
