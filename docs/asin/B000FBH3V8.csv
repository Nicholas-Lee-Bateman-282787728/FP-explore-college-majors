Right off the bat we see the inspector trying to park his car and it sets the stage for the rest of the terrible ""comedy"" this film has to offer. From there, it flows effortlessly from one terrible gag to the next, like when he's trying to help the woman off the table.The accents---terrible. Steve Martin--I was just embarrassed for him in this movie. He actually proncounces the same words DIFFERENTLY from one scene to the next. Sometimes he pronounces his R's as R's, and other times as W's--so brutal to watch. And what was up with Kevin Kline? His accent was there in one scene and gone the next. Was it supposed to be a French accent or an English accent? It seemed to change from minute to minute. The scene with Steve Martin and the voice coach is among the most foolish concoctions in the movie, and that is saying something.Every attempt at comedy in this movie was so forced and unnatural that I couldn't help but feel sad for every actor in the film. How could they put their name on this. You could see the ""gags"" coming from a mile away and it was just so sad.The originals were brilliant, and they are NOT something that should be remade, because it can not be done successfully.All I can say is...ouch...And now they are doing a sequel?

The movie isn't nearly as bad as you'd think and it certainly isn't as bad as the worst of the original Peter Sellers movies.This new updated version of the Pink Panther  - starring cameos by Jason Statham and Clive Owen and featuring a lovely performance by Emily Mortimer - is rather a vehicle for showing the comedic talents of Steve Martin who talks funny with his fake French accent as he assumes the role of the bumbling Inspector Clouseau made famous by Sellers.The story - or what there is of it - begins when Yves Gluant, (Statham) France's most famous soccer coach (and boyfriend of the beautiful pop star Xania (Beyonc&eacute; Knowles) is murdered in plain sight in front of a huge crowd after leading his team to victory against China. By the time anybody notices that Gluant is dead- the priceless Pink Panther diamond has disappeared from his finger.Enter Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) turns to Clouseau (Martin) the least competent cop in France to help solve the mystery. Dreyfus hopes that the press will devote its attention to Clouseau, thus freeing him to solve the crime in a less pressured environment. Dreyfuss has also been nominated for the Medal of Honor for the seventh time and this time he plans to win it at any cost.Much of the movie is composed of sight gags, there are lots of people falling over and running into things and generally being stupid. Much of the witty repartee comes from the chemistry between Martin accident-prone Clouseau and the Martin as the snobbish and patronizing Dreyfuss. Both are extraordinarily vulnerable - Clouseau because of his hubris, pride and insecurity and Dreyfus chiefly because of Clouseau.Martin embeds Clouseau with a touch of the innocent and its this innocence that lends the love story between him and his secretary, Nicole (an adorable Emily Mortimer). But the best thing about the replica is how wholeheartedly Martin throws himself into the physical comedy, which is uniformly hilarious. Most of the laughs are pretty juvenile, aimed for ten year olds, with the only really funny jokes coming from a scene involving flatulence and Viagra.The best part of the film is when the opening titles kicks in with an animated sequence featuring a squat cartoon Clouseau and the slinky panther-playing cat and mouse to the strains of Henry Mancini's sublime burlesque theme. The rest of the film is very much direction by numbers.Even the best Pink Panther movies were never great cinema, just great fun; the scripts were vehicles for Sellers' genius, which combined lordly timing with a gift for absurd physical comedy. He was a buffoon, but he was a buffoon with dignity, Martin does a good job of carrying on the legacy, but one sort of wonders why the series needed to be remade in the first place.

Here is a classic example of a bad idea, you shouldn't fix what isn't broken even if your trying to bring a cult classic to a whole new audience. The main problem is not that the character, is bigger than the actor, rather that the character WAS the actor, and watching Steve Martin, trying to play Sellers, playing Clouseau is a mess. Using the idea that this is a prequel doesn't do him any favors either. A Shot in the Dark introduced Sellers as Clouseau back in 1964, in arguably one of his funniest turnouts, alongside his long suffering boss Dreyfuss (the inimitable Herbert Lom) and a superbly dry supporting role by the late George Sanders. Here Martin relies way to much on some very ridiculous sight gags, and struggles with some awful dialogue as he attempts to recover the famous ""Pink Panther"" diamond, stolen during a football game at the beginning of the movie. His sidekick Ponton played by the always pleasing Jean Reno attempts to mirror the Bert Kwok character of Cato, only without any of the bumbling pathos of the originals, and even Kevin Kline playing Dreyfuss, can't lift this picture out of mediocrity. One has to tip their hat to Martin et al, for taking on a remake of sorts where the bar had been previously set so high, but wonders if an allegorical character based pastiche would have been more appropriate. The movie has some funny moments, but overall is a real let down. I had expected it to be OK but no where near as good as the original, but even going in with this pragmatic approach, I was left disappointed.

Everything feels as dated as the films that inspired this, and when they try and make them feel `new' they throw out the lazy fart jokes.

Personally I think he does a better job then Peter Sellers. Steve Martins awful English accent is just about right and he acts the part to perfection. Some of the scenes are instant classic like the farting in the sound proof room and many others. Personally I find this version allot more fun then Peter Sellers then again I am a huge fan of Steve Martin and I consider him to be comedic genius well in league with other greats such as Eddie Murphy and Bill Murray to mention a few. The music is right on the mark. The script is very well written and the dialogue is perfect for this awesome remake. Highly recommended indeed.

987343,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B000FBH3V8,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[2, 4]","The original Peter Sellers ""Pink Panther"" episodes were before my time. So, I really can't make a comparison here.But that said, this movie is certainly good for a few laughs and there are enough serious elements to prevent it from becoming an utter farce. (Not to mention a sub plot on corruption as well as deception.)A murder takes place at a soccer match in France. Chief Inspector Kline sees this as a chance to win a public service award that he has been nominated for several times, but never actually won. His plot is to put the bumbling Clouseau on the case. (He feels that Clouseau will bumble along, accomplish nothing, and buy time for Kline to uncover the murder.)While Clouseau certainly bumbles throughout the story, we see that he is not exactly an utter idiot either. For one thing, Beyonce's boyfriend was the murder victim at the soccer match. And a jealous x boyfriend is a major suspect. But Clouseau knows that this is just a little too obvious.I don't want to say too much and possibly ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it. But at about the 2/3 point, the movie stops being funny. And while we may have been laughing at Clouseau's bumbling throughout the movie, we are moved into deep sympathy for him when he is framed and hounded by the corrupt Kline.Granted, we may understand Kline's frustration at his repeated coming close to a coveted award, but never actually getting it. But his actions against Clouseau were not only cruel, but they were illegal as well. (Arranging for him to have a suitcase full of weapons at the airport.)But here the movie gets interesting. Through a number of seemingly bad clues he obtained throughout the movie, Clouseau is able to find out what is really going on. This leads to a climactic chase and final confrontation where we are cheering for the detective we once laughed at.(So, first we were laughing at Clouseau; then we were moved into sympathy for him; and finally, we are cheering him on. GREAT!)To top it off, it is virtually impossible not to enjoy it when Clouseau's corrupt boss gets a major comeuppance. We may have seen Clouseau as a bumbler for sometime, but in one of the last scenes, we can certainly smile and give a sarcastic: ""Oops.""I'm sure many Peter Sellers fans will be reluctant to accept Steve Martin in the role.

987345,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B000FBH3V8,Brent Butler,"[0, 0]","Steve Martin has done so well in his original roles, I have to wonder why he felt the need to ""cover"" the Peter Sellers performances of Inspector Jacques Clouseau. There is no question that there is always a risk associated with following up on the performance of an iconic character and series of movies. I haven't kept up with Martin's box office, but perhaps his numbers were slipping and he felt taking this chance was justified in the hopes he would hit a home run. After all, many of Martin's roles bear a great similarity to many of Sellers' roles, so there is a foundation upon which to justify this attempt.I want to preface the remainder of the review by noting that I've been a Steve Martin fan for decades now. Martin was a comedy writer for the Smothers Brothers show all the way back in the late sixties, although he came to national prominence more in his own right ten years later on Saturday Night Live. He went from there to sold out ""comedy concerts"", and of course a string of movie hits that are always amusing, and more often than not brilliantly funny (""The Jerk"", ""Roxanne"", ""All of Me"", and more). So I'm predisposed to like anything he appears in. I found this movie a bit bland, despite the HUGE benefit of the doubt Martin is going to get from a long time fan like me.In the original Pink Panthers movies (at least after the first, in which Clouseau was a supporting character that took off), the mystery to be solved is not really the most important element of the story, as would be the case with most mysteries. The mystery is just a framework upon which to hang a continuing series of scenes in which Peter Sellers cracks you up, again and again. This movie shares that philosophy. In the long run, you'll probably have trouble remembering much about the plot, as the movie banks on the ability of Steve Martin to keep you laughing. It works in spots, but in others the pacing just doesn't seem correct. Sellers could take on a scene with a slow boil to a laugh and keep pulling you in. In similar style scenes in this movie, it just looks like comedy in slow motion, and those scenes are a little painful to watch. Some reviewers have said that they don't think Martin was trying to recreate the Sellers' performances. I'm not sure I agree with that. The jokes and slapstick were clearly meant to follow up on the Sellers' films. If Martin was not trying to mimic Sellers, at least the character was written in a very similar style, forcing him to look like he might have been mimicking Sellers.All is not lost, as there are some very funny bits in this film, they are just fewer and farther between than I was hoping they would be. The much promo'd scene where Clouseau is trying to drop his French accent, and the overuse of the word ""'ambuger"" is indeed a pretty funny sequence, to my mind. There are indeed other slapstick and situational sequences that are funny. However, it is not as funny as Sellers' Clouseau when Sellers was in ""the zone"".I recommend this as a Netflix queue selection, or catching it on TV, rather than a purchase. I think only a minority of viewers will want to watch this again and again. There are Steve Martin movies I've watched a dozen or more times, but I have a hard time working up enthusiasm to see this one even a second time. And why should I, when I can fire up ""Roxanne"" and watch him do the 20 very amusing nose jokes (actually about 23, if I remember my count LOL).",3,Below average for a Steve Martin film,1294012800,"01 3, 2011",2011,3441,"['Steve', 'Martin', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'original', 'roles', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'felt', 'need', 'cover', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'performances', 'Inspector', 'Jacques', 'Clouseau', 'question', 'always', 'risk', 'associated', 'following', 'up', 'performance', 'iconic', 'character', 'series', 'movies', 'have', ""n't"", 'kept', 'up', 'Martin', 'box', 'office', 'perhaps', 'numbers', 'were', 'slipping', 'felt', 'taking', 'chance', 'was', 'justified', 'hopes', 'would', 'hit', 'home', 'run', 'many', 'Martin', 'roles', 'bear', 'great', 'similarity', 'many', 'Sellers', 'roles', 'foundation', 'justify', 'attempt.I', 'want', 'preface', 'remainder', 'review', 'noting', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'fan', 'decades', 'now', 'Martin', 'was', 'comedy', 'writer', 'Smothers', 'Brothers', 'show', 'way', 'back', 'late', 'sixties', 'came', 'national', 'prominence', 'more', 'own', 'right', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'went', 'sold', 'out', 'comedy', 'concerts', 'course', 'string', 'movie', 'hits', 'are', 'always', 'amusing', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'Jerk', 'Roxanne', 'Me', 'more', ""'m"", 'predisposed', 'like', 'anything', 'found', 'movie', 'bit', 'bland', 'HUGE', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'Martin', 'going', 'get', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'original', 'Pink', 'Panthers', 'movies', 'least', 'first', 'Clouseau', 'was', 'supporting', 'character', 'took', 'off', 'mystery', 'be', 'solved', 'not', 'really', 'most', 'important', 'element', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'case', 'most', 'mysteries', 'mystery', 'just', 'framework', 'upon', 'hang', 'continuing', 'series', 'scenes', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'cracks', 'up', 'again', 'again', 'movie', 'shares', 'philosophy', 'long', 'run', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'have', 'trouble', 'remembering', 'much', 'plot', 'movie', 'banks', 'ability', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'keep', 'laughing', 'spots', 'others', 'pacing', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'correct', 'Sellers', 'could', 'take', 'scene', 'slow', 'boil', 'laugh', 'keep', 'pulling', 'similar', 'style', 'scenes', 'movie', 'just', 'like', 'comedy', 'slow', 'motion', 'scenes', 'are', 'little', 'painful', 'watch', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Martin', 'was', 'trying', 'recreate', 'Sellers', 'performances', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'agree', 'jokes', 'slapstick', 'were', 'clearly', 'meant', 'follow', 'up', 'Sellers', 'films', 'Martin', 'was', 'not', 'trying', 'mimic', 'Sellers', 'least', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'very', 'similar', 'style', 'forcing', 'look', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'mimicking', 'Sellers.All', 'not', 'lost', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'bits', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'fewer', 'farther', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'promo', ""'d"", 'scene', 'where', 'Clouseau', 'trying', 'drop', 'French', 'accent', 'overuse', 'word', ""'ambuger"", 'indeed', 'pretty', 'funny', 'sequence', 'mind', 'are', 'indeed', 'other', 'slapstick', 'situational', 'sequences', 'are', 'funny', 'However', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'Sellers', 'Clouseau', 'when', 'Sellers', 'was', 'zone', 'recommend', 'Netflix', 'queue', 'selection', 'catching', 'TV', 'rather', 'purchase', 'think', 'only', 'minority', 'viewers', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'are', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'dozen', 'more', 'times', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'working', 'up', 'enthusiasm', 'see', 'one', 'even', 'second', 'time', 'why', 'should', 'when', 'can', 'fire', 'up', 'Roxanne', 'watch', 'do', '20', 'very', 'amusing', 'nose', 'jokes', 'actually', 'about', '23', 'remember', 'count', 'LOL']",N/A

987347,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B000FBH3V8,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[25, 30]","This 2006 movie remake is a comedy film with plenty of slapstick, sex jokes, fart jokes, and physical- type humor. It offers Kevin Kline and Steve Martin in the main roles and having watched the original Pink Panther and one of the Pink Panther follow ups (Return of the Pink Panther), I can say with confidence that this version isn't very good. With the original Pink Panther, you had David Niven and Peter Sellers in the starring roles in a comedy movie that was fun, original, and entertaining all the way through thanks to the performances and the script. With this version, you have a movie that relies on fart jokes, vases stuck to Steve Martin's hands, bullets falling out of a revolver, and other assorted silliness for its entertainment value.In some ways, one can't help but laugh during certain moments of this film- even when the comedy isn't very mature or very original. Take for instance a scene near the beginning where Steve Martin's Inspector Clouseau character is trying to parallel park his small car between two other cars. There is plenty of room, but the idiotic Clouseau keeps backing the car and moving it forward, hitting the car in front and the car behind and causing the bumpers to fall off of each of the two vehicles. It isn't original and it isn't intelligent but you find yourself laughing anyway. Much of the comedy in the rest of the movie is of the same variety. It does make you laugh a little, but the humor is more the result of the comedy's goofiness than genuine funniness.Among the performers in this movie, the only one worth mentioning is Steve Martin and his portrayal of the French- accented character, the bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau. Martin's Clouseau character is confidently incompetent- the type of person who thinks they are right about everything when they are actually right about nothing. Many critics have already attacked Martin because he isn't very much like Peter Sellers- the original Jacques Clouseau. It is inevitable that critics and viewers try to compare this movie and its performers to the original (I'm guilty of this, too), but I don't think it's fair to criticize Steve Martin for not being more like Peter Sellers. First, it would be very tough to match Sellers in playing the role of Jacques Clouseau. Second, Martin's character, aside from the accent, is really a character all his own- a new version, if you will, of Inspector Jacques Clouseau. If anything, Martin's character reminds me of the Clouseau from the Pink Panther cartoons. In fact, much of the comedy in this movie is like that of a cartoon. With the bumping, the banging, and the general physical nature of the humor, it reminds me of old Pink Panther cartoons with a touch of Bugs Bunny.Other than Steve Martin, I didn't find anyone else in this movie particularly memorable. Kevin Kline was ok, and so was Beyonce Knowles. But no one stands out in this movie as someone who has contributed a great performance. Martin is the only one who gets your attention. The goofy French accent and his wild and crazy persona are the only parts of this movie that make it worthwhile, in spite of the sub par script and the slower than average pacing.Overall, The Pink Panther is a comedy with few laughs, weak writing, and even less originality. It scores a few points for Steve Martin's zany portrayal of Inspector Jacques Clouseau, but other than that, the film is a wipe out. It's like a glass of American brewed light beer: Weak- bodied and wimpy but with just enough taste and ease of consumption to keep you from dumping it down the drain.",2,"Another Remake, Another Disappointment",1153180800,"07 18, 2006",2006,3583,"['2006', 'movie', 'remake', 'comedy', 'film', 'plenty', 'slapstick', 'sex', 'jokes', 'fart', 'jokes', 'physical-', 'type', 'humor', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'main', 'roles', 'having', 'watched', 'original', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'one', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'follow', 'ups', 'Return', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'can', 'say', 'confidence', 'version', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'original', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'had', 'David', 'Niven', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'starring', 'roles', 'comedy', 'movie', 'was', 'fun', 'original', 'entertaining', 'way', 'thanks', 'performances', 'script', 'version', 'have', 'movie', 'fart', 'jokes', 'vases', 'stuck', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'hands', 'bullets', 'falling', 'revolver', 'other', 'assorted', 'silliness', 'entertainment', 'ways', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'certain', 'moments', 'film-', 'even', 'when', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'very', 'mature', 'very', 'original', 'Take', 'instance', 'scene', 'beginning', 'where', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Inspector', 'Clouseau', 'character', 'trying', 'parallel', 'park', 'small', 'car', 'two', 'other', 'cars', 'plenty', 'room', 'idiotic', 'Clouseau', 'backing', 'car', 'moving', 'forward', 'hitting', 'car', 'front', 'car', 'behind', 'causing', 'bumpers', 'fall', 'off', 'two', 'vehicles', ""n't"", 'original', ""n't"", 'intelligent', 'find', 'laughing', 'anyway', 'Much', 'comedy', 'rest', 'movie', 'same', 'variety', 'make', 'little', 'humor', 'more', 'result', 'comedy', 'goofiness', 'genuine', 'performers', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'portrayal', 'French-', 'accented', 'character', 'bumbling', 'Inspector', 'Jacques', 'Clouseau', 'Martin', 'Clouseau', 'character', 'confidently', 'incompetent-', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'are', 'right', 'everything', 'when', 'are', 'actually', 'right', 'nothing', 'Many', 'critics', 'have', 'already', 'attacked', 'Martin', ""n't"", 'very', 'much', 'Peter', 'Sellers-', 'original', 'Jacques', 'Clouseau', 'inevitable', 'critics', 'viewers', 'try', 'compare', 'movie', 'performers', 'original', ""'m"", 'guilty', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fair', 'criticize', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'not', 'being', 'more', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'First', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'tough', 'match', 'Sellers', 'playing', 'role', 'Jacques', 'Clouseau', 'Second', 'Martin', 'character', 'aside', 'accent', 'really', 'character', 'own-', 'new', 'version', 'will', 'Inspector', 'Jacques', 'Clouseau', 'anything', 'Martin', 'character', 'Clouseau', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'cartoons', 'fact', 'much', 'comedy', 'movie', 'cartoon', 'bumping', 'banging', 'general', 'physical', 'nature', 'humor', 'old', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'cartoons', 'touch', 'Bugs', 'Bunny.Other', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'anyone', 'else', 'movie', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'was', 'ok', 'so', 'was', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'one', 'out', 'movie', 'someone', 'who', 'contributed', 'great', 'performance', 'Martin', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'attention', 'goofy', 'French', 'accent', 'wild', 'crazy', 'persona', 'are', 'only', 'parts', 'movie', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'spite', 'sub', 'par', 'script', 'slower', 'average', 'pacing.Overall', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'comedy', 'few', 'laughs', 'weak', 'writing', 'even', 'less', 'originality', 'few', 'points', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'zany', 'portrayal', 'Inspector', 'Jacques', 'Clouseau', 'other', 'film', 'wipe', 'out', 'glass', 'American', 'brewed', 'light', 'beer', 'Weak-', 'bodied', 'wimpy', 'just', 'enough', 'taste', 'ease', 'consumption', 'keep', 'dumping', 'down', 'drain']",N/A
987348,A16PEMNNXMO1UQ,B000FBH3V8,"Butch Ediocy ""sleepyeyedplumber""","[2, 4]","I, being a fan of the Blake Edwards' Panther flicks themselves, have been wondering if the crew will pull together to make more Panther sequels. When the movie came out in theaters, I thought I would give it a shot to see how badly executed this film really is.Luckily, I was saved to see that they have done a decent job of bringing things up to par. And I say this, because the Edwards' flicks had this process that made the films classics: mediocre plotlines saved by the performance and mischief of a brainless, bumbling Inspector Clouseau played by the one and only Peter Sellers. Steve Martin, playing as Clouseau, is no Peter Sellers, but is still great at the character's bumbling antics.After saying that, let me first tell how the story sets up: It all begins as a coach of a French soccer team has been murdered and his diamond ring-big diamond known as the Pink Panther which symbolizes his ""honor"" and ""courage""-has been stolen. Now the head policeman, Inspector Dreyfus, hires an idiot policeman named you-know-who to find the murderer/thief in an attempt to bag the suspect and win a Medal of Honor himself.And that's just the first 10 minutes. Around that time, the movie follows the same tradition of the old Edwards' flicks: an opening cartoon credit sequence starring the cartoon Pink Panther himself on a chase from a bumbling policeman, which I must admit holds up very nicely. After that peppy opener, the movie runs right into place as you finally see Clouseau run into some brilliantly funny, and sometimes racy antics trying to find the culprit. And believe me, there are some great gags to be had here, like Clouseau asking if the room is soundproof so he can go in and relieve some flatulence, as well as set a bathroom on fire while trying to get his ""miracle pill for middle-aged men"" out of the P-trap of a bathroom sink.However, this film isn't without its flaws. One of my biggest dissapointments is how the character for Inspector Dreyfus has been set up. In the Edwards' flicks the character was driven into the brink of insanity by the stupidity of Clouseau, even enough insanity to find ways to kill the inspector--And in this remake, he doesn't become insane at all. Another flaw is that towards the ending Clouseau actually solves the case, and in the originals, he never did solve any cases. (Or even if he did, he's pretty darn close.)

One of the latest is ""The Pink Panther"", a movie which in my opinion should have never been made. Steve Martin stars as the bumbling French Inspector Jacques Clouseau, the role made famous by the late Peter Sellers, who has been assigned a very high profile murder / robbery case for sole purpose of  distracting the press as the ""real"" team of investigators solve the case behinds the scenes. Unfortunately the plot of this film is useless and nearly nonexistent. It seems that the movie exists as nothing more than an excuse for Martin to get back to the box office after his surprise hit ""Bringing Down the House"". Many of the gags that Sellers executed to perfection in the original films seem tired and unoriginal, and honestly just aren't very funny. Even the supporting cast which include Kevin Kline (De-Lovely), Jean Reno (The Professional) & yes even Beyonce Knowles were unable to save this film from what I consider a less than mediocre attempt at comedy. I admit that the gimmick of Pop Singers crossing over into films is beginning to wear thin, as it seems that more and more movies are nothing more than an excuse to spotlight a hot Pop Star singing one of their latest hits. The bottom line is I found nothing in this film that made me even crack a smile, however my seven year old son thought the movie was very funny. I'm not sure that this was the target audience for ""The Pink Panther"", but at this point they should take what they can get.

987352,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000FBH3V8,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 8]","I went into Shawn Levy's remake of ""The Pink Panther"" expecting very little; if the ads weren't enough to generate a laugh, then how can one hope for a laugh when it's actually released in theaters? Indeed, laughter was quite infrequent the day I saw it; I guess today's audiences don't see the humor in physically and emotionally tormenting a Chief Inspector or in breaking wind inside of a supposedly soundproof recording booth. And yet, for its many, many flaws, I have to admit that the film wasn't as overwhelmingly awful as I expected it to be.Still, I can't recommend this film. It's nothing but a mesh of uninspired slapstick, shallow verbal gags, and annoyingly predictable outcomes. In other words: it's nothing we haven't already seen a thousand times before in other lowbrow comedies. I'm waiting for the day when the definition of ""remake"" veers away from ""to dumb down and compromise the integrity of the original."" I'm also waiting for the day when Hollywood realizes that remaking every movie released before 1980 is unnecessary. I do feel that certain films benefit greatly from a reinterpretation, especially when the originals were released before the technology, the directors, or the actors were around to do the story justice. But when a film was well made to begin with, like the original ""Pink Panther"" was, then I only have this to say: if it ain't broke, don't fix it.For this new version, Steve Martin (using an annoyingly exaggeraged French accent) replaces Peter Sellers as Jacques Clouseau, the well-intentioned but incurably inept French inspector. He's called upon by the arrogant and mean spirited Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) to solve the mystery behind the murder of soccer coach Yves Gluant (Jason Stratham in a very small role) and the disappearance of his obscenely large ring set with the Pink Panther diamond. The prime suspect is his fiancee, Xania (Beyonce Knowles), who happens to be a world famous pop singer.Of course, she's not the only suspect. At one point, one of Gluant's players says to the murderer (whose identity is still hidden), ""Oh, it's you."" This prompts Clouseau to round up every person in France by the name of Yu, the number of which is more than 27,000. Not surprisingly, this insane method of suspect elimination is not followed up as the plot advances. However, we are treated to one interrogation of an old Chinese woman (who, as you can probably guess, is unable to speak French).At Clouseau's side is Gendarme Gilbert Ponton (Jean Reno), a lower rank officer assigned to assist Clouseau and to keep him at bay (the latter of which he fails at miserably). It's quite obvious who the more competent crime solver in this duo is. Why else would he be able to foil Clouseau's attempts to attack him without warning (supposedly to keep him alert)? Even though they're supposed to be an odd couple, the chemistry just isn't there. It was almost as if they were in two completely different films. Maybe it would have helped if Reno had chosen to make his character a little quirkier as opposed to playing it straightforwardly. He's so bland and uninteresting, and that doesn't fit with a ""Pink Panther"" movie. That could be one of the reasons why the original 1963 film had so many sequels.When Clouseau learns that Xania has left for America, he decides that, if he's to follow her, he must learn to speak in an American accent. The scene in which his dialect coach tries to get him to say, ""I would like to buy a hamburger,"" couldn't have lasted more than two minutes. So then why did it seem to go on much longer than that? It was enough to make me wish that the entire subplot had been eliminated from the film altogether. It goes absolutely nowhere. And it simply wasn't funny.Another idea that failed to capture my interest involved Dreyfus' secretary, Nicole (Emily Mortimer). It was clear that the filmmakers were trying to show a love interest between her and Clouseau. Some tender moments are shared, but they were too few to warrant serious consideration. It didn't help that Nicole was merely a notch below Clouseau in terms of her display of physical humor. It only goes to show that in comedies such as these, opposite attractions are more interesting than two people who are made for each other.I'm not sure how this happened, but a cameo by Clive Owen as a James Bond knockoff managed to work its way into the film. He plays Agent 006, a suave secret agent hired to hunt down a bandit group that disables their victims with gas bombs. Why they included this character or this subplot, I have no idea; they added nothing to the story, nor did they play big enough parts to leave me satisfied with their inclusion. I really don't think that expanding this idea would have helped the film; like the nonexistent chemistry between Martin and Reno, Owen's role seemed to belong in a different film. I suppose a James Bond spoof would be a lot of fun to watch (films like ""Spy Hard""), but it shouldn't push its way into someone else's movie.This 2006 version of ""The Pink Panther"" came off the same way that most of the original version's sequels did: lackluster and comically over the top (in a bad way). I seriously doubt if this remake will garner any sequels. But if it somehow manages to, then the filmmakers need to pay close attention to the script (it was almost shocking to see in the opening credits that Steve Martin had partially written this film). They also need to choose their director wisely. Not even a cleverly animated opening title sequence (virtually identical in style to those of the original films) can gloss over the disappointing job Levy did. But I think the most important thing they need to do is redefine their definition of an entertaining comedy. Maybe then films like this won't get made.",2,This Will Not Tickle You Pink,1139529600,"02 10, 2006",2006,5801,"['went', 'Shawn', 'Levy', 'remake', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'expecting', 'very', 'little',

Police director Dreyfuss decides to assign the most inept inspector he has so he can solve the crime himself without the attention of the press on him. He gives the job to Clousseau, played by Steve Martin, and Clousseau bumbles his way through the investigation.The case at the center of the movie is uninteresting and nothing Clousseau does during his investigation lets the audience in on who might have done it. Clousseau suddenly figures it all out and explains it to everyone in the last five minutes of the movie. My real complaints are with the attempts at humor. Every pratfall and joke is telegraphed.

Peter Sellers, hilarious French accents, pain and destruction gags, the Pink Panther diamond that kept getting stolen, the animated character who appeared in the titles sequence, and that famous theme song by Henry Mancini.  Well, in this latest version of the film, clearly the latter five are present, given that Sellers passed away in 1980.  Despite being identically titled to the original 1964 movie, this is clearly a Pink Panther movie for the current generation and technology, given the use of cellphones and references to the Internet and email.The story?  A French football coach, Yves Gluant, the owner of the Pink Panther diamond, is murdered after the French score the winning goal, the giant diamond which was shown on his fist on the stadium's giant screen TV, missing.  Chief Inspector Dreyfus sees this as the chance to become a winner and not merely a nominee for the French medal of honour.  He plans to have a total nincompoop in charge of a bogus investigation, while Dreyfus himself conducts the real one with smarter people.  Guess who's in charge of the bogus one?The suspects range from Bizu, a football player whose girlfriend, pop singer Xania, was stolen by Gluant.  Then there's Raymond Leroq, the casino owner whom Gluant went into a partnership with, but whose gambling habit irritated Leroq.  Xania, played with bootyliciousness by Beyonce Knowles, is well aware that Clouseau (Steve Martin) is gaga at the sight of her and uses her feminine wiles to... well, maybe divert suspicion?Clouseau is given help in the form of Gilbert Ponton (Jean Reno), someone who is used to following orders.  However, during the investigation, it's apparent that he is more competent than his superior.  And Nicole the secretary gives him encouragement.  Oh, and there's some unexpected help from a British agent who's one digit away from being on top.The slapstick gags that garnered many a giggle or howl are present.  As a nod to Sellers' Clouseau getting his hand stuck in a globe in the first PP movie, Martin's Clouseau sends the globe rolling down the stairs and into the street until it causes some cyclists to crash.  And the pain gags, often at Dreyfus's expense are just as painful, such as a scene where Clouseau flips open his ID badge, only to have the badge fly out and pierce Dreyfus's chest.  Hoewver, Kato, the Chinese manservant who attacked Clouseau randomly to keep the detective on his toes, is conspicuous by his absence.  Here, it's Clouseau who randomly attacks Ponton, only to realize his subordinate is really on his toes.Martin, who also has co-screenplay writing credit, manages the bogus French accent well, and he doesn't fare too badly as Clouseau, but his mannerisms can be overdone, and gags that are meant to be funny misfire.  His failure to pronounce the word ""hamburger"" leads to an airport security sequence mirroring that of the Bean movie-what's the point?One notable difference is the Dreyfus-Clouseau relationship.  Whereas from A Shot In The Dark, Herbert Lom's Dreyfus was driven to insanity and hated Clouseau, Kevin Kline's Dreyfus is a more rational schemer and gloryseeker trying to get the glory he deserves.  Those wild eyes and that smile are there, but he's not the over-the-top psychopath he was in A Fish Called Wanda.While A Shot In The Dark and The Pink Panther Strikes Again stand as classics in the series, this one is at least better than Revenge of the Pink Panther and the lamentable Sellers-less Curse of the Pink Panther with Ted Wasson.",4,"Martin is no Sellers, but film still has laughs",1140134400,"02 17, 2006",2006,3574,"['Ah', 'yes', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'films', '1960', '1970', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'hilarious', 'French', 'accents', 'pain', 'destruction', 'gags', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'diamond', 'kept', 'getting', 'stolen', 'animated', 'character', 'who', 'appeared', 'titles', 'sequence', 'famous', 'theme', 'song', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'Well', 'latest', 'version', 'film', 'clearly', 'latter', 'five', 'are', 'present', 'given', 'Sellers', 'passed', 'away', '1980', 'being', 'identically', 'titled', 'original', '1964', 'movie', 'clearly', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'movie', 'current', 'generation', 'technology', 'given', 'use', 'cellphones', 'references', 'Internet', 'email.The', 'story', 'French', 'football', 'coach', 'Gluant', 'owner', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'diamond', 'murdered', 'French', 'score', 'winning', 'goal', 'giant', 'diamond', 'was', 'shown', 'fist', 'stadium', 'giant', 'screen', 'TV', 'missing', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Dreyfus', 'chance', 'become', 'winner', 'not', 'merely', 'nominee', 'French', 'medal', 'honour', 'have', 'total', 'nincompoop', 'charge', 'bogus', 'investigation', 'Dreyfus', 'real', 'one', 'smarter', 'people', 'Guess', 'who', 'charge', 'bogus', 'one', 'suspects', 'range', 'Bizu', 'football', 'player', 'girlfriend', 'pop', 'singer', 'Xania', 'was', 'stolen', 'Gluant', 'Then', 'Raymond', 'Leroq', 'casino', 'owner', 'whom', 'Gluant', 'went', 'partnership', 'gambling', 'habit', 'irritated', 'Leroq', 'Xania', 'played', 'bootyliciousness', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'well', 'aware', 'Clouseau', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'gaga', 'sight', 'feminine', 'wiles', 'well', 'maybe', 'divert', 'suspicion', 'Clouseau', 'given', 'help', 'form', 'Gilbert', 'Ponton', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'someone', 'who', 'used', 'following', 'orders', 'However', 'investigation', 'apparent', 'more', 'competent', 'superior', 'Nicole', 'secretary', 'encouragement', 'Oh', 'unexpected', 'help', 'British', 'agent', 'who', 'one', 'digit', 'away', 'being', 'top.The', 'slapstick', 'gags', 'garnered', 'many', 'giggle', 'howl', 'are', 'present', 'nod', 'Sellers', 'Clouseau', 'getting', 'hand', 'stuck', 'globe', 'first', 'PP', 'movie', 'Martin', 'Clouseau', 'globe', 'rolling', 'down', 'stairs', 'street', 'cyclists', 'crash', 'pain', 'gags', 'often', 'Dreyfus', 'expense', 'are', 'just', 'painful', 'such', 'scene', 'where', 'Clouseau', 'open', 'ID', 'badge', 'only', 'have', 'badge', 'fly', 'pierce', 'Dreyfus', 'chest', 'Hoewver', 'Kato', 'Chinese', 'manservant', 'who', 'attacked', 'Clouseau', 'randomly', 'keep', 'detective', 'toes', 'conspicuous', 'absence', 'Here', 'Clouseau', 'who', 'randomly', 'attacks', 'Ponton', 'only', 'realize', 'subordinate', 'really', 'toes.Martin', 'who', 'also', 'co-screenplay', 'writing', 'credit', 'bogus', 'French', 'accent', 'well', ""n't"", 'fare', 'too', 'badly', 'Clouseau', 'mannerisms', 'can', 'be', 'overdone', 'gags', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'funny', 'misfire', 'failure', 'pronounce', 'word', 'hamburger', 'airport', 'security', 'sequence', 'mirroring', 'Bean', 'movie-what', 'point', 'One', 'notable', 'difference', 'Dreyfus-Clouseau', 'relationship', 'A', 'Shot', 'Dark', 'Herbert', 'Lom', 'Dreyfus', 'was', 'driven', 'insanity', 'hated', 'Clouseau', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Dreyfus', 'more', 'rational', 'schemer', 'gloryseeker', 'trying', 'get', 'glory', 'wild', 'eyes', 'smile', 'are', 'there', 'not', 'over-the-top', 'psychopath', 'was', 'Fish', 'Called', 'Wanda.While', 'A', 'Shot', 'Dark', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'Strikes', 'Again', 'stand', 'classics', 'series', 'one', 'least', 'better', 'Revenge', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'lamentable', 'Sellers-less', 'Curse', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'Ted', 'Wasson']",N/A
987362,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000FBH3V8,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 4]","It goes without saying that no one can ever take the place of Peter Sellers, who will always be the perfect embodiment of Inspector Clouseau, but Steve Martin - a legend in his own right - really takes this role and runs with it, leaving a steady train of laughter in his wake.  I thought the entire film was very funny - lots of slapstick stuff, of course, but also some more subtle humor that played well without becoming pretentious.  Martin's fake French accent was a definite winner, and - let's face it - a fake French accent is the funniest accent of them all (with the possible exception of the Swedish Chef from the Muppets, of course).If you're like me, you've probably wondered at one time or another just how the cartoon Pink Panther and the Pink Panther movies are connected.  Well, you're going to have to keep wondering because I'm still not sure myself.  Sorry about that.  Anyway, in this particular film (loosely based on the original movie in the series), the Pink Panther is an obscenely gigantic diamond that is stolen from the head coach of the French soccer team when he is murdered in the middle of a packed soccer stadium.  Inspector Clouseau is brought to Paris, made a detective, and given charge of the murder case - not because he is the right man for the job, but because Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) wants an incompetent boob to divert media attention while he goes about solving the case himself - thereby ensuring himself of his long-coveted Legion of Honor award (for which he has already been nominated seven times).Determined to finally prove his detective skills, Clouseau throws himself into the investigation, leaving no stone unturned.  Because justice is justice and France is France, he will not rest until the murderer is caught.  All kinds of hilarity ensue as he unleashes his unique good cop, bad cop interrogation technique on a witness, demands to question a murder victim, endeavors to lose his French accent for some undercover work in America, and generally goes around making a fool of himself without even realizing it.  It's a recipe for constant hilarity.Don't expect a lot from the story itself, as it's thrown together somewhat haphazardly; just sit back and revel in the comedic antics of Steve Martin.  He is at all times the center of attention, although I must say that the rest of the cast is quite good (although  I think Jean Reno's enormous talents are wasted for the most part as Clouseau's sidekick Ponton).  Beyonce Knowles acquits herself well in the role of the murder victim's girlfriend, and Kevin Kline seems to take great delight in his role as Chief Inspector Dreyfus.The bottom line is this: this new incarnation of The Pink Panther is an exceedingly funny movie, and Steve Martin proves himself to be the perfect choice to try and fill Peter Sellers' shoes for a new generation.  I'm not naturally a fan of remakes such as this, but I think even the most dedicated Peter Sellers fan can really enjoy the humor of this film.

Reed,"[2, 4]","While most remakes fall flat for either being too different or just ripping off the original, this one is unique in that is different enough to be its own. Steve Martin does an excellent job, admirably taking over for the great Peter Sellers. The accent is his own and is very different from Sellers. Though I do like some of the references to the older films like Clouseau and the globe and the trouble his accent can get him into. Instead of manserveant Cato (we live in PC times, though Jackie Chan was considered), we get fellow lawman Ponton, played by Jean Reno, who is a good substitute character. Beyonce is also very good in this, proving, like Queen Latifah, that SOME singers can act. The only character who doesn't get any justice is Chief Inspector Dreyfuss. Though Kevin Kline does a fine job in the role, they've heavily changed how the character was. Instead of going increasingly insane and wanting to kill Clouseau with a passion, all this version does is try and show him up and humiliate him. Though seeing as how this and its sequel are marketed more towards kids than the originals (though plenty of innuendo abound in both), today's parents might find Dreyfuss' deteriorating mental state a little disturbing for their kids. The gags are quite funny, though Clouseau inspecting the room for spies gets and the fart joke is tedious (aren't they all).

Baer,"[1, 2]","When I first noticed in a trailer that Steve Martin was to be cast as the inimitable Inspector Clouseau, I exclaimed 'But of cooouuuurse!'.Martin's antics make him a born successor for the role, and he pulls it off with classic, predictable Martin antics. From the very beginning, it's very much about the silly walks. His entree comes that way in the film, as he ascends - officiously, slightly bowlegged, innocently - up the steps to meet Kevin Cline as the Chief Inspector Dreyfus.Cline does fine comedic work and Beyonce Knowles provides the eye candy. Not to be overlooked are two strong supporting roles. Jean Reno is hilarious as the taciturn Gilbert Ponton, Clouseau's partner. At times, he seems the only sane figure in the cast. Emily Mortimer is also strong, she of the crooked pictures who - unlike everybody else - seems to sense, admire, and eventually fall in love with Clouseau's virtues from the start.But you won't buy this flick for great acting, nor will you find it here.  You will find plenty of Martin-esque laughs and some delicious galling of the French at this time of transatlantic bickering.At 92 minutes, the move wraps things up while you're still chuckling.",3,zee healing powah of laughter,1151798400,"07 2, 2006",2006,1188,"['When', 'first', 'noticed', 'trailer', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'was', 'be', 'cast', 'inimitable', 'Inspector', 'Clouseau', 'exclaimed', ""'But"", 'cooouuuurse', ""'.Martin"", 'antics', 'make', 'born', 'successor', 'role', 'off', 'classic', 'predictable', 'Martin', 'antics', 'very', 'beginning', 'very', 'much', 'silly', 'walks', 'entree', 'way', 'film', 'officiously', 'slightly', 'bowlegged', 'innocently', 'steps', 'meet', 'Kevin', 'Cline', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Dreyfus.Cline', 'fine', 'comedic', 'work', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'eye', 'candy', 'Not', 'be', 'overlooked', 'are', 'two', 'strong', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'hilarious', 'taciturn', 'Gilbert', 'Ponton', 'Clouseau', 'partner', 'times', 'only', 'sane', 'figure', 'cast', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'also', 'strong', 'crooked', 'pictures', 'who', 'everybody', 'else', 'sense', 'admire', 'eventually', 'fall', 'love', 'Clouseau', 'virtues', 'start.But', 'wo', ""n't"", 'buy', 'flick', 'great', 'acting', 'will', 'find', 'here', 'will', 'find', 'plenty', 'Martin-esque', 'laughs', 'delicious', 'galling', 'French', 'time', 'transatlantic', 'bickering.At', '92', 'minutes', 'move', 'wraps', 'things', 'up', ""'re"", 'still', 'chuckling']",N/A

987370,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B000FBH3V8,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[13, 18]","I admit it:  I laughed at the slapstick, sophomoric comedy of Steve Martin's entry into the Pink Panther series.  While Martin is no Peter Sellers, he has his own brand of physical, over-the-top comedy that is well-suited to the role of the incompetent, although ultimately successful, Inspector Clouseau. This movie moves rapidly from one joke to another, sometimes genuinely funny and other times not.  Although the resolution hinges on a hilarious twist that depends on the viewer underestimating Clousseau as much as the other characters do, most of the plot is uninteresting.  There is no suspense - except for when the next laugh will come - but Martin carries the film forward regardless.When a rich soccer coach is murdered in front of a stadium full of cheering fans and his famous Pink Panther diamond is missing from his hand,  an investigation begins.  Wily Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) wants the most incompetent man to lead the investigation - hence the entry of Clouseau.  Dreyfus wants to uncover the identity of the murderer on his own while the public is diverted by the bumbling Clouseau.  Clouseau, on the other hand, sees the case as the opportunity of a lifetime; he can prove his ""superior"" detective skills and serve his beloved France at the same time.  Jean Reno makes a superb, droll sidekick as Gendarme Ponton, a man who can only roll his eyes at Clouseau's antics but who develops an affection for the unwitting fall guy.  Together, Clouseau and Ponton tackle the case and its suspects, including the dead man's beautiful girlfriend, played by Beyonce Knowles.Steve Martin is the only actor who could pull off this role owned by Peter Sellers, and he succeeds by taking what Sellers did and modifying it with his individual comedy style.  Kevin Kline is delightfully slimy as Martin's frustrated supervisor. Don't expect anything new or ingenious in this film.  It's all low comedy, from flatulence jokes to the trademark Clouseau accent problems.  A few of the more clever touches, such as the appearance of a James Bond-like British secret agent and the surprising clue that solves the case,  are lost in the maze of one-liners and slapstick.  Still, this was an enjoyable ride, Steve Martin style.",3,Steve Martin as the Successor to Peter Sellers,1151712000,"07 1, 2006",2006,2239,"['admit', 'laughed', 'slapstick', 'sophomoric', 'comedy', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'entry', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'series', 'Martin', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'own', 'brand', 'physical', 'over-the-top', 'comedy', 'well-suited', 'role', 'incompetent', 'ultimately', 'successful', 'Inspector', 'Clouseau', 'movie', 'rapidly', 'one', 'joke', 'sometimes', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'other', 'times', 'not', 'resolution', 'hilarious', 'twist', 'viewer', 'underestimating', 'Clousseau', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'characters', 'do', 'most', 'plot', 'uninteresting', 'suspense', 'when', 'next', 'laugh', 'will', 'come', 'Martin', 'film', 'forward', 'rich', 'soccer', 'coach', 'murdered', 'front', 'stadium', 'full', 'cheering', 'fans', 'famous', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'diamond', 'missing', 'hand', 'investigation', 'Wily', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Dreyfus', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'most', 'incompetent', 'man', 'lead', 'investigation', 'hence', 'entry', 'Clouseau', 'Dreyfus', 'uncover', 'identity', 'murderer', 'own', 'public', 'diverted', 'bumbling', 'Clouseau', 'Clouseau', 'other', 'hand', 'case', 'opportunity', 'lifetime', 'can', 'prove', 'superior', 'detective', 'skills', 'serve', 'beloved', 'France', 'same', 'time', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'superb', 'droll', 'sidekick', 'Gendarme', 'Ponton', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'roll', 'eyes', 'Clouseau', 'antics', 'who', 'affection', 'unwitting', 'fall', 'guy', 'Together', 'Clouseau', 'Ponton', 'tackle', 'case', 'suspects', 'including', 'dead', 'man', 'beautiful', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles.Steve', 'Martin', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'role', 'owned', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'taking', 'what', 'Sellers', 'did', 'modifying', 'individual', 'comedy', 'style', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'delightfully', 'slimy', 'Martin', 'frustrated', 'supervisor', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'new', 'ingenious', 'film', 'low', 'comedy', 'flatulence', 'jokes', 'trademark', 'Clouseau', 'accent', 'problems', 'few', 'more', 'clever', 'touches', 'such', 'appearance', 'James', 'Bond-like', 'British', 'secret', 'agent', 'surprising', 'clue', 'case', 'are', 'lost', 'maze', 'one-liners', 'slapstick', 'Still', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'ride', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'style']",N/A
987371,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000FBH3V8,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 2]","Immensely funny!  Steve Martin succesfully pulls off his version of Inspector Clouseau and bringing `THE PINK PANTHER' to a new generation.Having grown up watching the ""THE PINK PANTHER"" films starring Peter Sellers and the popular films directed by Blake Edwards, to tell you the truth, it was hard to see a new Pink Panther film with a new cast and modernized but after watching this film, I was very impressed by the performance by Steve Martin and I couldn't help but laugh throughout the movie and knowing that this reboot of the popular Pink Panther name will definitely be enjoyed by a new generation of viewers who are not familiar with the classic films.The film starts off introducing Inspector Clouseau (Steve Martin), narrated by Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Kevin Kline).  Clouseau is literally clumsy and very much an Inspector that really doesn't have a clue.We then learn about the Pink Panther, a huge pink diamond ring that is worn by Yves Gluant (played by Jason Statham), who walks down to kiss his girlfriend Xania (Beyonce) during a major soccer match.  After the French team wins, the team celebrates but then Gluant is stabbed in the neck with a poisoned dart and dies.  A closeup of the hand shows that the Pink Panther diamond is missing.So, as Chief Inspector Dreyfus is excited about his nomination for the ""Legion D'Honneur"" (Medal of Honor), he needs someone in the force that he can hire that is clumsy and not really good to dig up what they can on Gluant's murder and the missing Pink Panther diamond and then fire him, so he can take credit for it.  What better person to hire for the role but third class detective Jacques Closeau who is immediately promoted to Inspector.  Hired to keep an eye on Closeau will be Gendarme  Gilbert Ponton (Jean Reno) as the two investigate who may have killed Yves Gluant and who may have stolen the diamond.Throughout the film, we are introduced to major key players who has a motive to kill and to steal but as Chief Inspector Dreyfus hopes Inspector Clouseau to bumble the case, somehow he gets positive media attention for his work.  But all is not good as certain key witnesses are killed or may be up to no good.  Will Closeau solve the case in time?Throughout the whole film, we watch as the entire film is shot through a variety of beautiful locations in France and also in New York.  Each talented brings something fresh to the characters that they play but its Steve Martin showing his comedic wit as Inspector Clouseau and helping make the character as believably clumsy, naive but somehow an Inspector doing his job.  A very enjoyable film filled with a lot of humor and silliness that makes the film's storyline all worthwhile.VIDEO & AUDIO:""THE PINK PANTHER"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  The video quality was very well done as it manages to capture the beauty of France and there a good number of outdoor scenes that were just vibrant in colors and overall, video quality was very good.  I did not see any scratches or dust or artifacting.As for the audio, the audio is featured in TrueHD 5.1.  Although, primarily a dialogue film, I did notice some surround sound being utilized during action scenes and music distribution.  But overall, it is a dialogue-driven film.SPECIAL FEATURES:This is where ""THE PINK PANTHER"" Blu-ray disc shines.  There is a lot packed into this disc.  Included are:# Extended Beyonce Performance: ""A Woman Like Me"" Plus Commentary - This is one of the songs that Beyonce performed in the film.  This is the extended version of that performance.# Animated Trip - An interesting special feature on the creation of the Pink Panther animated opening.  With all Pink Panther films starting from 60's to the present, all have had animated openings and thus, this featurette goes into the creation of the opening segments and interviewing the people involved in the process.# Audio Commentary with Director Shawn Levy - Shawn Levy really gave a good commentary and definitely good in discussing working with the various talents, the locations of where the film was shot and the various improvising for the storyline and much more.  A lot of tidbits to learn from the commentary in regards to the film.# Beyonce - ""Check On It"" - The Music video for Beyonce's second song used for the film.# 11 Deleted & Extended Scenes with Optional Director's Commentary - This scene really goes into detail on several segments cut.  There were some major footage cut that utilized a good number of extras, probably cost quite a bit to make or film those segments but were actually cut.  In a way, I agree with the director cutting these scenes no matter how painful it may have been for pacing reasons.  But overall, awesome that there is that optional director's commentary for these deleted or extended scenes.  There are eleven and quite lengthy as well.# Cracking the Case Documentary - A pretty length featurette on the actual filming, working with the talent and knowing how Steve Martin, Kevin Kline and director Shawn Levy worked out a lot of improvisation for this film.# Deconstructing the Panther - A featurette that goes into the planning for the film and what they wanted to accomplish to making it different from past Pink Panther films and creating that same magic for the new generation who may have not seen the past films.  Interviews with each major talent in the film and more.# Sleuth-Cam - Three behind-the-scenes lengthy footage of actual filming of several key scenes in the film. Literally a camera recording the whole process of the director and film staff recording, showing the talent of sections he wants to redo in the film and more.# Code Pink: Animated Graphics-in-Picture Track - This segment features the Pink Panther or Inspector Clouseau (animated) popping up with tidbits on the making of the film.  From references to Steve Martin's moustache, historical facts on locations where the film was shot and more.I really enjoyed ""THE PINK PANTHER"" film.  Mainly because of what Steve Martin brought to the table.  To say that Inspector Clouseau is an idiot is an understatement.  From the gags of trying to parallel park his miniature automobile and his ability to keep running and backing into the cars while trying to park, to being suspicious each time he walks into a room and thinking someone maybe hiding behind the curtains, his relation with his partner Ponton and his assistant Nicole. There is just this nice chemistry among the talent involved and they just made this film work!As for the Blu-ray release, I was very impressed by the picture quality.  The coverage of Clouseau and Ponton all over France and the beautiful shot exteriors to the overall colors in the film were well-done and the audio quality to hear the popular Harry Mancini Pink Panther theme distributed in different channels through your speakers was quite interesting.  But where the Blu-ray shines is its ability to feature a lot of special features.These special features are lengthy and literally, with the number of featurettes and other footage included, you definitely get your money's worth because so much is included on the Blu-ray disc.Overall, I have to say that this was a very solid and enjoyable Blu-ray release.  Great picture and audio quality and many special features to keep those who enjoyed the film quite busy.  For those who were as dedicated as the Travers version of the film, those ""Pink Panther"" films from the past will continue to be classics but for the new generation who have no familiarity to those films, the Steve Martin version of ""Pink Panther"" is enjoyable and hilarious.  So, you'll definitely have a great time watching it!If you are a looking for a fun comedy film, definitely give ""THE PINK PANTHER"" a try.",4,"If you are looking for a comedy on Blu-ray, definitely give `The Pink Panther' a try!

I love the originals, grew up with them, and had no wish to see them ""replaced.""  Do a sequel, I said.  And I was right about that; however, Steve Martin not only portrayed Clouseau with style, he gave an absolutely admirable performance!!The storyline was not weak or shaky as has been indicated by other reviewers.  Not in my opinion, at least.  I followed it fine.  Clouseau's usual bungling, pratfalls, and physical comedic medium remains unblemished, but did serve to mess with the fluidity of the execution, if only on the surface.  I did not find that a serious fault in the direction, but rather in the viewer who was not keeping up.All the clues were there, without being perfectly obvious, making for an intriguing mystery.  That, combined with Steve Martin's loving portrayal of a venerable Sellers character, made for great entertainment.The movie-goers in my small town are not a demonstrative bunch, but Steve Martin received a rousing ovation at the end of this feature in my small home town theater.  We were all very skeptical of this remake.  Martin is NOT Sellers, personally I was fearful of what he would do to the character.I was delighted by the quality of this work in all aspects and cannot wait to own it on DVD!I highly suggest waiting for the extended edition/director's cut, as there is sure to be one.

987376,A1Q1PP3Z4QDUQM,B000FBH3V8,Farffleblex Plaffington,"[2, 4]","The Pink Panther is an example of the most difficult kind of ""reimagining"" (that word fits much better since this is not really a remake and there are too many incongruous elements to make it a prequel).  The problem is that the property is so strongly identified with a particular character and a particular actor's performance that either you make the new film a different, but related character, or you have to hire a new actor to effectively do an impersonation of the actor known for the role.  Neither option tends to be accepted very well by audiences, and the second option, impersonation, is probably riskier, especially when the original is still fresh in most person's minds, the original actor is a legend, and the role was their best known.  That's the challenge that director Shawn Levy and actor/writer Steve Martin took in The Pink Panther, and unfortunately, the results weren't entirely successful.*No matter how good Martin is in the role, there's no doubt that he's doing an impersonation of Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau, and no one, Martin or otherwise, is going to be able to do Sellers as Clouseau as well as Sellers could.  The same is true of Kevin Kline as Chief Inspector Dreyfus, although that's not as much of a problem because Kline doesn't exactly seem to be doing an impersonation of Herbert Lom as Dreyfus, and he can more easily get away with that because as excellent as Lom was, the Pink Panther films are not nearly as strongly identified with him.  Still, if we compare Kline to Lom, Kline has nowhere near the charisma or nuanced performance here that was typical of Lom.Very roughly, the plot of this new Pink Panther is similar to a typical Pink Panther plot, but where it deviates, it tends to be the worse for it.  Having Beyonce play a pop star and sing a couple songs is a barely disguised marketing ploy.  Was the role originally written as a pop star?  Probably not.  But Beyonce brings interest from a particular youth demographic, and surely Beyonce's management said that if the producers wanted her for the film, they had to allow her to sing a couple songs, and that only made sense by writing her character as a pop star.  It's not that Beyonce is a bad actress.  But dramatically, the character as written--especially including the songs--does absolutely nothing for the film.  The only major change from a typical Pink Panther plot and feel that worked well was the introduction of a police chaperone for Clouseau, played by Jean Reno.Too many jokes are recycled material--even considering this as a remake.  For example, Clouseau spins a large globe in an office and it leads to slapstick-oriented disaster.  Martin and Levy extend the bit, but it doesn't work any better for the extension.  But Martin even recycles bits from other films, such as Clouseau's attempt at parallel parking.Some of the comic material is very funny--I did laugh aloud often enough and even had to pause the film once because I was laughing hard enough to tear up, but overall, the film is very uneven.  A very funny bit would be followed by a few jokes that fell completely flat, including a surprise visit from a James Bond-like character, which should have been a hoot.  Even Clouseau taking a side investigative trip to New York City was mostly a wasted opportunity, although I enjoyed the absurdity and almost avant-garde nature of the scene where Clouseau tries to learn American pronunciation.  Martin is a big fan of absurdism and the avant-garde.  I wish he'd put more material like that in his films.Still, even though I was disappointed overall--especially given the occasional glimpses of a much better film on the parts that worked--The Pink Panther was entertaining enough.  I will watch it again at some point the future.  But just make sure that you don't miss any of the Peter Sellers films.  This new version pales in comparison.(*It's interesting to note that 1993's Son of the Pink Panther took the other route--a related but different character, and had audience reception problems, although I enjoyed it well enough, while 1968's Inspector Clouseau took the same route as the present film, and is also routinely chided, although I have yet to see it, so it's difficult for me to say to what extent Alan Arkin is doing an impersonation of Peter Sellers-as-Inspector Clouseau in that film).",3,A mixed bag for a difficult situation,1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,4351,"['Pink',

Both Steve Martin and Kevin Kline are simply lame in their respective roles as Clouseau and Dreyfus.  I can't imagine what they were thinking in involving themselves in this disaster except that they imagined themselves comic equals to Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom.  Well, they're not.  In fact, they are light years away.  All this movie does is make you long for comedic genius anywhere near Sellers.  Unfortunately, there isn't any.  (Will Ferrell is an imbecile.)The actors seem confused and out of it.  Kline's accent drifted in and out of parodying Lom - or Artemus Gordon.  His comic registration of emotions or physical state were severely, embarrassingly limited.  Worse, though, was Martin trying to be and not be Sellers simultaneously.  He simply does not have the chops for the kind of physical comedy that was Sellers' trademark as Clouseau.  In fact, Martin has apparently sold out to the Hollywood machine that produces lame remakes like ""Bad News Bears,"" etc.Worst of all is the direction and writing.  For the first, there is none to speak of;  the pace of the film is deadly dull.  For the second, the funniest(?) gag is Martin-as-Clouseau trying to say ""hamburger"" with a French accent.

Lastly, (or rather, firstly) the epic intro is one of the most stunning movie introductions I have ever watched.An interesting thought experiment is to think about the intro in the context of another movie. With slight modification it would have played just as beautifully in front of a modern Perry Mason murder mystery movie.

So true.If there's one thing about the original, there was a good flow to it.  Even though there were some strange segues, there was cohesiveness about it.  Why Peter Sellers did what he did and said what he said made sense.  In this version, there are many scenes that just don't seem to fit.  Martin comes off at times way too stupid.  He appears to do things just as a setup to be funny (try to be funny).Kevin Kline was a disappointment as well.  Although I liked his version of Dreyfus at first, it seemed to lag and suffer no real development.  And forget about Beyonce.  She was TERRIBLE!  It was so blatant that her presence was only due to her popularity, not her talent.  Perhaps with better direction, she could have been better.  But she's a singer/performer first, and acting does not seem to be her strong suit.So, I skipped ahead to the end of the movie to see how it unfolds... and again, I was shaking my head as to what the producers were thinking.  Clearly there was a lot invested in the production.  Everything looks terrific.  But... ""where's the beef""?  If there's one thing this movie did for me, it made me appreciate the original even more.",1,"If anything, it'll make you appreciate the Peter Sellers version",1301356800,"03 29, 2011",2011,1659,"['really', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'done', 'truly', 'fabulously', 'funny', 'work', 'few', 'duds', 'way', 'well', 'Unfortunately', 'think', 'one', 'duds', 'WOW', 'was', 'SO', 'disappointed', '30', 'minutes', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'why', 'am', 'watching', 'movie', 'very', 'weak', 'imitation', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'quintessential', 'comedy', 'reviewer', 'hit', 'nail', 'head', 'Martin', 'saying', 'mannerisms', 'can', 'be', 'overdone', 'gags', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'funny', 'misfire', 'So', 'one', 'thing', 'original', 'was', 'good', 'flow', 'Even', 'were', 'strange', 'segues', 'was', 'cohesiveness', 'Why', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'said', 'what', 'said', 'made', 'sense', 'version', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'Martin', 'off', 'times', 'way', 'too', 'stupid', 'do', 'things', 'just', 'setup', 'be', 'funny', 'try', 'be', 'funny', '.Kevin', 'Kline', 'was', 'disappointment', 'as', 'well', 'liked', 'version', 'Dreyfus', 'first', 'seemed', 'lag', 'suffer', 'real', 'development', 'forget', 'Beyonce', 'was', 'TERRIBLE', 'was', 'so', 'blatant', 'presence', 'was', 'only', 'due', 'popularity', 'not', 'talent', 'Perhaps', 'better', 'direction', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'singer/performer', 'first', 'acting', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'strong', 'suit.So', 'skipped', 'ahead', 'end', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'again', 'was', 'shaking', 'head', 'what', 'producers', 'were', 'thinking', 'Clearly', 'was', 'lot', 'invested', 'production', 'Everything', 'terrific', 'where', 'beef', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'did', 'made', 'appreciate', 'original', 'even', 'more']",N/A

It's not a remake of the original but a new story based on the theft once more of the famous Pink Panther diamond and murder of its last owner. One thing about this film is that it gives Steve Martin a chance to act rather than present a variation of his usual self up there on the screen. He does not try to copy Seller's interpretation of the role that he had long established but uses elements from Seller's and his own film experiences to create something new, different yet recognizable. Martin's performance, though strained at times, really comes through in the final third of the film and he shows us a bit of some witt lacking in Seller's performance. Martin's performance is closer to Arkin's in 1968's INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU. You actually have an amount of empathy for Martin and that seems so work and save this film. The titles are good behind the ""Pink Panther"" theme and the rest of the score even demonstrates some moving innovation at times. In all this is not a bad Pink Panther film.

Dreyfus figures that while Clouseau is bumbling, he (Dreyfus) will solve the murder himself and win the fame, fortune, and the medal of honor.  Steve Martin is quite amusing as the French-accented bumbling inspector and Kevin Kline makes an excellent egocentric sneaky two-faced villain.Anyone who has ever watched a movie or two can figure out the overall plot direction, although it's fun trying to figure out the specifics of just how Clouseau will solve this murder.  It was also fun watching some over-the-top special effects such as Clouseau creating a spectacular fire and plumbing accident in Xania's (a famous singer well-played by Beyonce Knowles) hotel suite bathroom.My biggest complaint is that gags dragged on for too long.  After a few seconds of Clouseau trying to parallel park a tiny car in a huge space by banging into the vehicles in front of him, we get the idea.  Ditto for Clouseau's trying to learn an American accent from the world's best language coach by repeating the phrase, ""I want to buy a hamburger.""  Viewers will find some gags either amusing or un-amusing because they are such preposterous extrapolations of Murphy's Law.I found this to be a fine movie for killing an hour and a half on an airplane (4 stars in the air), although had I been on solid ground, I know I would have found the movie a bit less amusing (only 3 stars).  I think children around ages 10 to 12 will especially enjoy the movie.  Despite the fact it contains a murder (spectacularly played out at an international soccer game), most of the violence is slapstick, and there was no sex or inappropriate language (although granted my version may have been edited for airplane viewing).  If you're in a light-hearted mood or stuck on an airplane, you may enjoy this movie.

This spy-comedy was a major success and it begun a series of Pink Panther cartoons theatrically and as a tv-series. People had already seen the James Bond 007 films, Dr No (1962) and From Russia With Love (1963).The second ""Pink Panther"" film, A SHOT IN THE DARK (1964), introduced Herbert Lom as ""Dreyfuss"", Bert Kwouk as ""Kato"", Peter Sellers, of course, returned as the bumbling Inspector, a role he would continue to play in 3 more films, THE RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER (1975), THE PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN (1976), REVENGE OF THE PINK PANTHER (1978).  Peter Sellers died in 1980.They had an idea. With the use of unseen footage of Sellers and bringing back other characters in new footage, they were able to make Trail of the Pink Panther (1982).At the same time, they were also filming ""CURSE OF THE PINK PANTHER"" (1983) with Ted Wass (ABC's SOAP) as the Inspector.10 years later, they tried Roberto Benigni as ""SON OF THE PINK PANTHER"" (1993).13 years later, in an attempt to bring back The Pink Panther, Steve Martin was chosen as the new ""Inspector Clouseau"" after much voice training on Martin's part. However the number 13 would be unlucky for the film.No one from the original films made an appearance.Steve Martin tries in this one with Jean Reno as his partner, ""Pon Ton"". Kevin Kline as ""Dreyfuss"".  Kristin Chenoweth has three small scenes.  They should have made her part of the lead instead. She would make a great second banana to Steve Martin.  Steve Martin and Jean Reno look great as partners.Special Features: Audio Commentary by Director Shawn Levy, Alternate Opening title sequence CG version, Extended and deleted Scenes, featurettes, behind-the-scenes sleuth-cams.A music video and a performance of Beyonce.A clip of Sweet & Low ""Think Pink"".Option of English or French.

I loved his very convincing yet funny French accent. Kevin Kline was decent in the film but it's still hard to picture Kline in a comedy when he usually always does dramatic roles. Jean Reno who teams up with Martin for most of the film really makes the film enjoyable. Martin and Reno were a great comedic team. I can't even really complain about Beyonce on this even though I feel she should seriously stick to her singing career. They limited her role and it worked. She was a decent addition to the cast and remained much more as a small supporting role which I think worked out better for the overall film. I guess she can also add  this role to her resume for being featured in another detective/spy franchise (the other being Mike Myers' Austin Powers as Foxy Cleopatra).There is a funny moment in the casino segment of this film, which revolves around a cameo by Clive Owen even though the scene has nothing to do with the story of the film. And of course Steve Martin's memorable comedic scenes including the ""Hamburger scene"" and the ""Did you just say"" scenes.The problem many parents will have with this film is the number of adult jokes that seem to be in the film. I kept thinking to myself ""What was this rated again?  Then I double check the disc cover and read PG and said to myself ""well it sure had a lot of adult undertones"" I haven't seen the original but I believe the original cut had a lot more of them then. I would have to say though the sexual undertones here are similar to movies like ""Shrek"" and things of that nature. While the parents see the joke one way, the little kids see it another way. If the original film had the over the top sexual content then I appreciate the director, Shawn Levy, for editing it out.Steve Martin made this movie. I don't think no one else could have played the roll like he did. Maybe Jim Carey, but he also is a bit of an over actor. Steve made it happen. The storyline is predictable and it's nothing to shout about.

Corn ""reviewer""","[11, 16]","First off, it was a pretty brave move on Steve Martin's part to take on a role which is indelibly linked with Peter Sellers, a man who was not only formidable, nutty, and temperamental but a  genius when it came to creating pure, innovative (and often impromptu) humor.Martin is certainly no slouch in this department but I confess that I was a bit leery of his abilities (talented as he is) to hold his own against one of the stronger figures in comedic history. I wondered if he'd fall short in the effort.IMO, he does just fine, even adding special nuances that are absolutely brilliant, including an accent that is original, not a mere duplication of what Sellers did. He also adds flourishes of his own, reviving the Pink Panther genre.BUT (and this is not a small point)....the rest of the cast pales in comparison to Martin. Beyonce Knowles (cast a a beautiful pop star..gee,what a stretch) does well enough but has a ways to go before reaching full acting potential. She seems simply typecast as a the beautiful, possibly duplicitous, character. Kevin Kline, one of my favorite actors, has a relatively small role and that was a bit of a disappointment because I'd have liked to see more of him on screen.While the plots of Pink Panther movies aren't all that critical (playing a secondary role to the humor) there certainly IS a plot here, involving murder, thievery and all that). Whether you care about that plot is another matter. I didn't, preferring to focus on Martin, a guy who seems to hit his stride here. It was pure entertainment just watching him perform.I think there is a unique freshness to this film and it wouldn't be such a bad thing if the film was compared to the original, each film having their own merits - and flaws.Humor, of course, is always a bit hit or miss...and very personal. Some people laugh hysterically at things other people simply ""don't get."" Also, some people just don't seem to like Martin.What I've always liked about Martin's humor is that it often forces me to think about what deeper meanings under his apparent frivolity. It doesn't seem to be ALL fun and games...although the fun and games are pretty entertaining in and of themselves.Take a chance on this one. It is NOT for everyone and it WILL leave some people cold. BUt it might be just the thing for a pleasant diversion and some solid humor.",4,"Steve Martin shines but don't expect Peter sellers- this is a revamped version, but still FINE viewing",1139529600,"02 10, 2006",2006,2353,"['First', 'off', 'was', 'pretty', 'brave', 'move', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'part', 'take', 'role', 'indelibly', 'linked', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'formidable', 'nutty', 'temperamental', 'genius', 'when', 'came', 'creating', 'pure', 'innovative', 'often', 'impromptu', 'humor.Martin', 'certainly', 'slouch', 'department', 'confess', 'was', 'bit', 'leery', 'abilities', 'talented', 'hold', 'own', 'one', 'stronger', 'figures', 'comedic', 'history', 'wondered', ""'d"", 'fall', 'short', 'effort.IMO', 'just', 'fine', 'even', 'adding', 'special', 'nuances', 'are', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'including', 'accent', 'original', 'not', 'mere', 'duplication', 'what', 'Sellers', 'did', 'also', 'flourishes', 'own', 'reviving', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'genre.BUT', 'not', 'small', 'point', '.the', 'rest', 'cast', 'pales', 'comparison', 'Martin', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'cast', 'beautiful', 'pop', 'star..gee', 'what', 'stretch', 'well', 'enough', 'ways', 'go', 'reaching', 'full', 'acting', 'potential', 'simply', 'typecast', 'beautiful', 'possibly', 'duplicitous', 'character', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'relatively', 'small', 'role', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointment', ""'d"", 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'screen.While', 'plots', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'critical', 'playing', 'secondary', 'role', 'humor', 'certainly', 'plot', 'here', 'involving', 'murder', 'thievery', 'care', 'plot', 'matter', 'did', ""n't"", 'preferring', 'focus', 'Martin', 'guy', 'who', 'hit', 'stride', 'here', 'was', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'just', 'watching', 'perform.I', 'think', 'unique', 'freshness', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'such', 'bad', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'compared', 'original', 'film', 'having', 'own', 'merits', 'flaws.Humor', 'course', 'always', 'bit', 'hit', 'miss', 'very', 'personal', 'people', 'hysterically', 'things', 'other', 'people', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Also', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'Martin.What', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Martin', 'humor', 'often', 'think', 'what', 'deeper', 'meanings', 'apparent', 'frivolity', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'ALL', 'fun', 'games', 'fun', 'games', 'are', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'themselves.Take', 'chance', 'one', 'NOT', 'everyone', 'WILL', 'leave', 'people', 'cold', 'BUt', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'thing', 'pleasant', 'diversion', 'solid', 'humor']",N/A
987407,A27P0MW8TE1JQP,B000FBH3V8,Kevin J. Loria,"[4, 7]","IN A DEACADE in which it is cool to hate the FRENCH, remaking THE PINK PANTHER seems a natural. What isn't natural is making the film without director BLAKE EDWARDS (Skin Deep, Sunset, Victor / Victoria) : Offensive stereotypes, less than PC plotlines and of course old Hollywood's even less PC treatment of the women's roles.What of replacing the Inspector himself? What about PETER SELLERS, the original Inspector Clouseau, how can you replace him, in spite of the Trail / the Curse / the Son of the PINK PANTHER having been completed after Seller's passing. Who can fill those shoes? STEVE MARTIN? Maybe. Martin IS a GENIUS of physical comedy; he can do a stupid French accent almost as well as Kevin Kline (what he's in this too, wow!) What about the Chief (Inspector Dreyfus)? Yep, Kline is Clouseau's nemesis and boss. And CATO, sorry, without Edwards to champion ""all things un-PC"" we lose Burt Kwouk's clever Asian ""house-boy"", who is replaced by Jean Reno (The Professional) as Clouseau's partner and a satisfying straight-man, Gendarme Gilbert Ponton. Reno, like CATO is instructed by Clouseau to hone his skills by hilariously attacking him whenever possible(this time in reverse).The Story (or lack thereof): After a televised murder of French National Soccer team head coach Yves Gluant (Jason Statham of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), where the famous Pink Panther diamond is stolen Clouseau is called in to ""investigate."" Chief Inspector Dreyfus has picked Clouseau because he is sure to distract the media & mess up the high profile case, so that Dreyfus, can solve the case himself and win France's highest award: ""Ze Medal of `onor."" Beyonc? Knowles is cast as a pop-singer (quite a stretch there) & girlfriend of the victim, also the femme fatal of the movie who everyone thinks ""did it"" except Inspector Clouseau: ""LEAVE HER ALONE! CAN'T YOU ZEE SHE'S ZEXY?!?!"" She sure is Inspector! The late Edwards would have approved. Another hottie Blake Edwards would have included had he made this one is Clouseau's secretary Nicole (Emily Mortimer) another excellent physical comedian. As displayed in her ""too close for comfort"" scenes with Clouseau. Although the character is another painfully clich?d stereotype, ""the girl who is beautiful when see takes off her glasses.""Steve Martin plays Clouseau as the late SELLERS (and the late DON ADAMS in GET SMART & the animated INSPECTOR GADGET) did before him: as a moron impressed with his own genius creating chaos and destruction wherever he goes, yet still managing to ""solve"" the case in the end.. Some good throwaway moments of the movie are scenes where you watch Clouseau struggle with English & etiquette. Like the new Star Wars movies, familiar tunes and visuals tie us to the original saga: the animated Pink Panther & Henry Mancini's immortal theme were both used this way to adequate effect. What isn't familiar about this remake is the absence of foreign-film-feel that Blake Edwards achieved so brilliantly throughout all of the original films. New PANTHER director SHAWN LEVY, who worked with MARTIN in CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN (1& 2), is no stranger to the scene crumbling chaos necessary to let Clouseau be himself. Here he comes through in the PINK, as in the previously mentioned works with another lightweight, moderately-family-friendly-fare (e.g. crude and suggestive humor, fart jokes and language.)This is a funny remake of the classic film series. If you are familiar with the originals it will make you want to put them on. If you're not familiar with the original PINK PANTHER series check them out. In addition to the Pink Panther, there is: SHOT in the DARK, The Revenge of the PINK PANTHER, The PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN, (also filmed by Edwards, some with clips of the late Peter Sellers, some with filler-fools, but none quite as good as the first 5 films: ""the TRAIL of the PINK PANTHER,"" ""the CURSE of the PINK PANTHER,"" and ""SON of the PINK PANTHER."")

Whether the film is ""good"" or ""bad"" is hardly the question, it was funny!  Shawn Levy has directed some comedies like ""Big Fat Liar"" with Frankie Muniz, ""Just Married"" with Ashton Kutcher & Brittany Murphy & ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" with Steve Martin.  Bringing back Jacques Clouseau with Steve Martin was a great pairing.  There are so many funny bits like the ball he clumsily sets in motion that bounds down the stairs of the ministry to upset bicyclists and then it keeps reappearing throughout the film, still knocking down things.  Steven Martin drives the new Chrysler Daimler Smart Car that will be coming to the US next year and parks it hilariously knocking off the bumpers of the larger cars around him and then oblivious of the havoc he's wrought keeps going as if he's perfect and makes no errors.  The DVD deleted scenes where he leans on the molding in Dreyfus' office and knocks it off the wall is so silly!  ""That's where it wants to be & we should respect that,"" he says after knocking it off about the third time.  Then when Emily Mortimer from ""Match Point"" & ""Windtalkers"" is hanging a picture, she winds up with Martin's face in her skirt as he twirls about trying to gallantly set her down.  I laughed so hard.  Henry Czerny is a fine actor from ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" and ""Eye of the Killer.""  As the guilty Yuri, he adds a nice comic stupidity to the crime.  Kristen Chenoweth from ""Bewitched"" & ""RV"" bubbles delightfully as Cherie.  Jean Reno from ""The DaVinci Code"" & ""Ronin"" does a good job as Gendarme Gilbert Ponton who seems as much spy & conspirator as he does friend & partner.  Kevin Kline does a nice job as the Inspector Dreyfus who hires Clouseau for his incompetence.  The cameos by Jason Statham as the coach and Clive Owen as double-O-six are excellent.  Beyonce Knowles as Xania looked very nice in her dress.  ""The Pink Panther"" may not have been profound, but it did give me repeated belly laughs.  And that is just what the doctor ordered!

Just after winning a very important football match (that's soccer for us Americans), coach Yves Gluant is murdered. To top it off, Yves owned the Pink Panther diamond, and the diamond has vanished. It's a case guaranteed to make headlines for months if not years.And Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) knows it. Thinking this is finally his opportunity to gain the recognition he deserves, he decides to assign the most incompetent detective he can to the case. Dreyfus will then solve the crime behind the scenes and come in and save the day, making himself the hero.Chosen to be the fall guy is Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Steve Martin). When we first meet Clouseau, he's trying to solve the murder of a man who is still alive, by accusing everyone he meets, including a baby and the supposed victim, of the crime. Who could be better at not solving the crime then that?Of course, Clouseau thinks he's been given a great honor and sets out to solve the crime. He quickly begins making the rounds and coming up with suspects, including the victim's fiancee (Beyonce Knowles) and the soccer player who was first dating the fiancee. Then another murder takes place. Can Clouseau solve the case? Or will Dreyfus get all the glory?I must admit to not being familiar with the original Pink Panther movies. I came into this one with no expectations or preconceived ideas. I don't know if this helped me or not, but all I can say is I enjoyed the film.The plot is good and the mystery is logically solved, but it's merely an excuse for the comedy. Here, the movie shines. Clouseau is a complete bumbler, usually leaving behind ruin in his wake. A group of cyclists have several run ins with him, and Dreyfus has many a painful encounter as well. Additionally, Clouseau is thick headed, usually missing the obvious, even when it smacks him in the head. To top it off, there's the horrid French accent. Not even the other French in the film can understand him all the time, making the movie funnier for us. And the scenes where he is trying to pronounce ""hamburger"" are a riot.Obviously, for a movie like this to work, the performances have to be good. Steve Martin leads the way as Clouseau, making the dim-witted detective completely believable. Yes, much of the action is over the top, but watching Steve Martin, you easily forget that fact. Kevin Kline gets the thankless job of the straight man, and does a good job with it. The other straight man is Jean Reno, who plays the assistant assigned to keep an eye on Clouseau. He does an outstanding job with the role. Not only do we grow to like him by the end, but he also get some great laughs at the climax. Beyonce Knowles is the biggest weakness in the cast, but she has few scenes and hardly detracts from the overall effect.My biggest problem with the film is the sexual humor. Being a PG movie, I didn't think there would be so much or it would be so prevalent. I was shocked by a few of the gags, especially one involving Viagra. Frankly, not only were they not funny, they also did nothing to advance the story. Either these scenes should have been cut, or the film should have been given a more honest PG-13.Not having seen the originals, I can't compare them to this one. All I can tell you is I laughed from start to finish. By the time the movie was over, my sides hurt. This is a great movie for those looking to laugh; just watch it before you let the kids see it.",4,Steve Martin is out to Solve the Crime,1150156800,"06 13, 2006",2006,3464,"['murder', 'shocked', 'France', 'Just', 'winning', 'very', 'important', 'football', 'match', 'soccer', 'Americans', 'coach', 'Yves', 'Gluant', 'murdered', 'top', 'off', 'Yves', 'owned', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'diamond', 'diamond', 'vanished', 'case', 'guaranteed', 'make', 'headlines', 'months', 'not', 'years.And', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Dreyfus', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Thinking', 'finally', 'opportunity', 'gain', 'recognition', 'assign', 'most', 'incompetent', 'detective', 'can', 'case', 'Dreyfus', 'will', 'then', 'solve', 'crime', 'scenes', 'come', 'save', 'day', 'making', 'hero.Chosen', 'be', 'fall', 'guy', 'Inspector', 'Jacques', 'Clouseau', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'Clouseau', 'trying', 'solve', 'murder', 'man', 'who', 'still', 'alive', 'accusing', 'everyone', 'including', 'baby', 'supposed', 'victim', 'crime', 'Who', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'not', 'solving', 'crime', 'then', 'course', 'Clouseau', 'been', 'given', 'great', 'honor', 'out', 'solve', 'crime', 'quickly', 'making', 'rounds', 'coming', 'up', 'suspects', 'including', 'victim', 'fiancee', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'soccer', 'player', 'who', 'was', 'first', 'dating', 'fiancee', 'Then', 'murder', 'place', 'Can', 'Clouseau', 'solve', 'case', 'will', 'Dreyfus', 'get', 'glory', 'must', 'admit', 'not', 'being', 'familiar', 'original', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'movies', 'came', 'one', 'expectations', 'preconceived', 'ideas', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'helped', 'not', 'can', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'film.The', 'plot', 'good', 'mystery', 'logically', 'solved', 'merely', 'excuse', 'comedy', 'Here', 'movie', 'shines', 'Clouseau', 'complete', 'bumbler', 'usually', 'leaving', 'ruin', 'wake', 'group', 'cyclists', 'have', 'several', 'run', 'ins', 'Dreyfus', 'many', 'painful', 'encounter', 'as', 'well', 'Additionally', 'Clouseau', 'thick', 'headed', 'usually', 'missing', 'obvious', 'even', 'when', 'head', 'top', 'off', 'horrid', 'French', 'accent', 'Not', 'even', 'other', 'French', 'film', 'can', 'understand', 'time', 'making', 'movie', 'funnier', 'scenes', 'where', 'trying', 'pronounce', 'hamburger', 'are', 'riot.Obviously', 'movie', 'work', 'performances', 'have', 'be', 'good', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'way', 'Clouseau', 'making', 'dim-witted', 'detective', 'completely', 'believable', 'Yes', 'much', 'action', 'top', 'watching', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'easily', 'forget', 'fact', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'thankless', 'job', 'straight', 'man', 'good', 'job', 'other', 'straight', 'man', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'who', 'assistant', 'assigned', 'keep', 'eye', 'Clouseau', 'outstanding', 'job', 'role', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'grow', 'like', 'end', 'also', 'get', 'great', 'laughs', 'climax', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'cast', 'few', 'scenes', 'hardly', 'detracts', 'overall', 'effect.My', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'sexual', 'humor', 'Being', 'PG', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'prevalent', 'was', 'shocked', 'few', 'gags', 'especially', 'one', 'involving', 'Viagra', 'Frankly', 'not', 'only', 'were', 'not', 'funny', 'also', 'did', 'nothing', 'advance', 'story', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'honest', 'PG-13.Not', 'having', 'seen', 'originals', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'one', 'can', 'tell', 'laughed', 'start', 'finish', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'sides', 'hurt', 'great', 'movie', 'looking', 'laugh', 'just', 'watch', 'let', 'kids', 'see']",N/A
987416,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,B000FBH3V8,Mark,"[9, 16]","Somehow, Peter Sellers' Pink Panther, with all of its slapstick and hijinks, was extremely funny, whereas the updated Steve Martin version makes the hijinks irritating and extremely annoying.  This update is probably one of the most unecessary remakes of all time, next to Fun With Dick and Jane and Yours, Mine, and Ours.  Steve Martin is the stumbling, bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau who is promoted to Inspector by Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) to solve the case of the missing Pink Panther diamond, stolen from soccer team owner Yves Gluant (Jason Statham providing the cameo) after he was murdered.  Dreyfus hires Clouseau because he is incompetent, hoping that Clouseau will get nowhere so that he can solve the case himself, winning the medal of honor.  There is a brief romance subplot between Clouseau and the meek, shy secretary Nicole (Emily Mortimer), but it does not aid the hopelessly lost plot.  Clouseau begins investigation with his appointed partner Gendarme Gilbert Ponton (Jean Reno).  Throughout the investigation, we run into characters who are given no background or information whatsoever, and it's probably better that way.  Beyonce Knowles plays Xania, Yves Gluant's girlfriend, and she shows no acting talent at all.  She mainly is there for star power.  The writers, Steve Martin and Len Blum, lay the slapstick on thick, leading Clouseau on a pathetic trip to the United States where he destroys a hotel bathroom in search of his Viagra that (surprise!) went down the drain.  Not one moment of the film is unpredictible, and the slapstick can be seen coming from a mile away.  The Pink Panther was directed by Shawn Levy, who has worked with Martin before on Cheaper by the Dozen, and although his filmography is short-lived, it includes such atrocities as this garbage and Just Married.  All of the strong acting talents of Martin, Kline, Reno, Statham, and Mortimer are thrown into the garbage, and the result of this film is tired, boring, unfunny, and extremely sleep enducing.

Despite some questionable attempts at humor (boy, Jacques Clouseau keeps falling a lot), ""The Pink Panther"" is funny, thanks to Martin's dedication.Fresh off a clunky hosting gig on ""SNL"", Martin jumps into the role of Clouseau, and we see him back doing the kind of goofy comedy that was seen in movies like ""The Jerk"" and ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"". A lot of good moments he owns includes doing questionable acts toward Nicole (this movie's rated PG, by the way), getting his finger caught in a door, and getting his lower area electrocuted (belly laughs are ensured here). Oh, and the flatulence humor is inevitable, but it's funnier than it's written on paper.But in the hands of Shawn Levy, various amounts of humor are scattershot and unable to be enjoyed by the audience. I blame him for choosing Jean Reno to play the sidekick, because the French actor doesn't seem to be one for mugging, thus harboring the chance for the sexual humor to take off. And the director might have copied off of ""Taxi"" where Clouseau tries to parallel park, and he takes a bumper off the car behind him (sorry, it wasn't funny then, and it sure as hell ain't funny now). He does better than he did in critically bashed movies like ""Just Married"" and ""CBTD"", but Levy doesn't seem to try anything above sophomoric humor.""The Pink Panther"" boasts an incredibly huge cast of popular A-list stars. Sadly, they're not used to max potential. Beyonce Knowles, showing off comic flair - and an ode to blaxploitation films - in the last ""Austin Powers"" movie, isn't given much to do other than be seductive, then disappears for a long time. Kristin Chenowith, another comedic actress with potential, doesn't stay in the movie for long to offer energy that she displayed in ""Bewitched"".But what's really baffling - and I stress when I say ""baffling"" - is the cameo of Jason Statham as the coach of the movie. Buddy, I wouldn't make this up if I wanted to. It's bad, because of the minimal amount of screen time he's taking advantage of. His talent is too good to play a cameo in a ""small"" film like this. He should stick to leading roles.Despite all that complaining, ""The Pink Panther"" remains an entertaining movie. Steve Martin is as funny as ever, even at the age of 60, giving old-timer Leslie Nielson a run for the money. His screen presence is possibly the sole reason to see this flick, even if it can't hold up to Peter Sellars' career-making classic.",3,"""He's got white hair, a thin mustache...

aspect.  which of course means how can anyone find this film funny?  whereas sellers' interpretation always came across as bumbling yes but essentially harmless (well, you know what i mean).  martin turns him from bumbling fool into at the denouement a brilliant detective with an extraordinary memory.  seems a bit of of synch (sp) with the main part of the film, non?  sadly he also overacts on a scale i haven't seen in quite some time, to the extent where it became painful to watch.there are maybe one or two funy moments, but in the main the comedy is so heavily signposted that by the time the joke arrives it falls flat on its face.  how far have you fallen from/ since 'the man with two brains' steve?

Zwick,"[3, 6]","Let's face it: certain roles are so inextricably entwined with the actors who made them famous that it becomes almost blasphemous to envision any other performer ever taking over the part.  Judy Garland as Dorothy, Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, Dustin Hoffman as Tootsie, Lucille Ball as Lucy Ricardo - these are just a few of the many characters one would find unimaginable in the hands of any other performer (just look what happened when Vince Vaughn tried to usurp the role of Norman Bates from Tony Perkins a few years back!).  High on that list would certainly be Inspector Clouseau, the bumbling, befuddled, utterly endearing character embodied by the divine Peter Sellars in no fewer than five films beginning with the first ""Pink Panther"" in 1963 (a film in which Clouseau actually played a relatively minor role).  But Hollywood is nothing if not consistent when it comes to seizing an opportunity to feed off its own legends to make a quick buck, and so we have this new ""Pink Panther"" film with poor Steve Martin as the one being called on to fill Sellars' enormously oversized shoes.  The results are not impressive.Actually, as an actor Martin can not really be held responsible for failing to live up to Sellars' standard  - who could? - but he can certainly be blamed for the witless, unamusing script he has concocted along with co-author Len Blum.  The set-ups and sight gags are tired and obvious, and there is far too much reliance on stale double entendres when benign innocence is what is really called for.  The corny reaction shots showing the stupefied responses of various characters to Clouseau's series of epic missteps and societal faux pas deaden the comic timing, robbing the jokes of what little potential they might otherwise have had.  Martin's slurry accent ultimately becomes so annoying and grating that his Clouseau quickly wears out his welcome so that all we are left with in the end is 90 minutes of lame jokes and lowbrow slapstick to somehow try and get through.The ""case"" - involving the murder of a soccer coach and the theft of the famed Pink Panther diamond in a stadium packed with crazed sports fans - hardly merits reiteration.  Kevin Kline has some fun as a vain police chief determined to rid himself once and for all of his most incompetent detective, but Jean Reno is wasted playing the role of sappy straight man to the buffoonish Clouseau and singer Beyonce Knowles reveals little talent for acting in the two-dimensional role of the dead coach's girlfriend.It's hard to know who to be more embarrassed for - Steve Martin or Peter Sellars - while watching this desecration.

Finger-wagging is lame, but then so are Martin and director Shawn Levy for pitching the movie to 12-year-olds. Who else is supposed to laugh when Inspector Clouseau needlessly knocks the bumpers off two cars as he parks his mini-mini Cooper?Martin fails to fill just one of Peter Sellers' shoes as Clouseau, handicapping his performance with a doubly thick French accent and overdone physicality. The bumbling detective is called upon to be, unbeknownst to him, a Trojan horse by Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline, DOA) in the murder investigation of the national soccer coach. Clouseau will draw the media attention and the scent while Dreyfus assembles a crack team to actually solve the case.The killer's identity doesn't matter - Martin and co-writer Len Blum thought so little of the central plot that it's obvious the coach's murder would have been caught on tape anyway - and so we are left with 90 minutes of antics and aimless banter between Clouseau and his assistant (Jean Reno), Clouseau and his other assistant (Emily Mortimer) and Clouseau and Xania (Knowles), the coach's pop-star girlfriend. Beyonce is a total blank, a groomed thoroughbred cast for her hair and cleavage; like Jessica Simpson, she doesn't have a core personality outside the madonna/whore poses she strikes in her music videos. If you look real close, you'll see her lips moving.Kids could care less about any of these things. Most of them will laugh at the ""hamburger"" bit (which is nothing - nothing - more than a Saturday Night Live skit) and some of the dumber ones will pretend to laugh when Martin's face is buried in Mortimer's crotch.

Basically you can forget about the storyline and things like that, because it's not really about that, instead it's about a 90-minute slap-stick flick and comedy show so to speak. The film barely makes the PG rating and it should be more like PG-13 although there are only a couple of scenes that are at issue. Fact is that it's a funny movie and my wife said she wants to own it on DVD once it's released on DVD.

Granted, filling the shoes of Sellers, an enormously versatile and larger-than-life actor, was an impossible feat, casting Martin as Inspector Clouseau was probably the second biggest blunder in the film just behind the inclusion of Beyonce Knowles. (If I never see her in another movie again, it will be too soon!)Certainly, the idea of Clouseau was not intended to be a complex one. It just turned out that way after Sellers got a hold of him. On the surface, Clouseau was a vain, pontificating detective. His character never purposely tried to be funny. In fact, Clouseau always seemed to have a stern, smug, patronizing expression set on his face which on its own would not be that amusing were it not for his awkward posturing, absent-mindedness, and illogical crime-solving methods.In the context of the film, the role of Clouseau, the walking, talking contradiction; a decorated French inspector who somehow solved crime after crime, yet was unable to draw a bath or carry home a bag of groceries without suffering some calamity, could be no more aptly and humorously played than by Sellers. With his subtle and unique style, every glaring, pouting expression of impatience, every ridiculous caricature, every unwitting racially derogatory comment and drawn out accent slur, that today no amount of Hollywood budget acting and special effects could replicate, was what made the original Pink Panther series so exceptional.Very simply, the bar was set too high. Subtlety and that signature Sellers quirkiness were the essential ingredients that the new Inspector's performance lacked. To Martin's credit, probably few if any actors living today could have come close to filling the mold of Inspector Clouseau, but the combination of uninspiring acting, and weak plot was not as much unexpected as it was offensive, and a poor tribute to the original Pink Panther series.Despite my obvious disappointment with the film however, I felt it was important to reintroduce the Pink Panther series to the next generation of viewers, which it did, albeit tastelessly. I was also pleased with the one redeeming element, the film's soundtrack, which did lend some vitality to the vacuous plot.",1,Classic Turned Contemporary Garbage.,1147564800,"05 14, 2006",2006,2535,"['Being', 'huge', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'fan', 'knew', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'preview', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'unimaginative', 'Hollywood', 'rehash', 'timeless', 'classic', 'decided', 'give', 'chance', 'paid', 'price', 'entrance', 'ticket.Not', 'being', 'huge', 'Martin', 'fan', 'start', 'immediately', 'saw', 'kind', 'uninspired', 'performance', 'expected', 'Granted', 'filling', 'shoes', 'Sellers', 'enormously', 'versatile', 'larger-than-life', 'actor', 'was', 'impossible', 'feat', 'casting', 'Martin', 'Inspector', 'Clouseau', 'was', 'probably', 'second', 'biggest', 'blunder', 'film', 'just', 'inclusion', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'never', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'soon', 'Certainly', 'idea', 'Clouseau', 'was', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'complex', 'one', 'just', 'turned', 'out', 'way', 'Sellers', 'got', 'hold', 'surface', 'Clouseau', 'was', 'vain', 'pontificating', 'detective', 'character', 'never', 'purposely', 'tried', 'be', 'funny', 'fact', 'Clouseau', 'always', 'seemed', 'have', 'stern', 'smug', 'patronizing', 'expression', 'set', 'face', 'own', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'amusing', 'were', 'not', 'awkward', 'posturing', 'absent-mindedness', 'illogical', 'crime-solving', 'methods.In', 'context', 'film', 'role', 'Clouseau', 'walking', 'talking', 'contradiction', 'decorated', 'French', 'inspector', 'who', 'somehow', 'solved', 'crime', 'crime', 'was', 'unable', 'draw', 'bath', 'carry', 'home', 'bag', 'groceries', 'suffering', 'calamity', 'could', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'aptly', 'humorously', 'played', 'Sellers', 'subtle', 'unique', 'style', 'glaring', 'pouting', 'expression', 'impatience', 'ridiculous', 'caricature', 'unwitting', 'racially', 'derogatory', 'comment', 'drawn', 'out', 'accent', 'slur', 'today', 'amount', 'Hollywood', 'budget', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', 'could', 'replicate', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'original', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'series', 'so', 'exceptional.Very', 'simply', 'bar', 'was', 'set', 'too', 'high', 'Subtlety', 'signature', 'Sellers', 'quirkiness', 'were', 'essential', 'ingredients', 'new', 'Inspector', 'performance', 'lacked', 'Martin', 'credit', 'probably', 'few', 'actors', 'living', 'today', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'close', 'filling', 'mold', 'Inspector', 'Clouseau', 'combination', 'uninspiring', 'acting', 'weak', 'plot', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'unexpected', 'was', 'offensive', 'poor', 'tribute', 'original', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'series.Despite', 'obvious', 'disappointment', 'film', 'however', 'felt', 'was', 'important', 'reintroduce', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'series', 'next', 'generation', 'viewers', 'did', 'albeit', 'tastelessly', 'was', 'also', 'pleased', 'one', 'redeeming', 'element', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'did', 'lend', 'vitality', 'vacuous', 'plot']",N/A

He takes the Cluseau character and makes him sound like he's only got a 3rd grade education and overly effeminate. His piss-poor attempt at a French accent is insulting to phoney accent-makers everywhere (well..best term I could come up with there...just sayin' his accent is beyond stupid).

I am a huge fan of Peter Sellers and his film defined the French Sterotype we have today.  After his untimely death, Blake Edwards did everything he could to try to bring the series back to life, even attempting three films in the process, one using unused footage from the films, which didn't work.  Another using an unknown actor who seems to have the curse that Clusoe had, also bombed and was lame.  So he tried to use a real comedian, Roberto Benini (I don't think I spelled that right), who had the lines and physical comedy down, but the screenplay was so bad, his performance was overshadowed.Enter Steve Martin, who also co-wrote the screenplay for this prequel.  Oh no.  It seemed just another attempt to revive a dead series.  But Steve Martin pulled off perhaps making a decent series of his own.  People must remember that the original Pink Panther was the worst of the Peter Sellers era, but launched an unaticipated sequel with A Shot in the Dark, a vastly superior movie from the original.  The side note to this was that Sellers didn't want to do this murder mystery based on the play, but was contractually obligated to.  Blake Edwards' brillant idea was to have Sellers play Clusoe in the film and the rest is comedy history.I feel that Martin could do sequels that could be even funnier, than this rocky, but often funny film.  Just like Sellers.  I just have one complaint that Martin should take as advice to use in the future.  The next time you fall from the second story hotel room onto the Lobby counter, and you pop up, use the now infamous line that made Clusoe such a funny character, ""AHH, That Felt GOOD!"" That is vastly more hilarious than, ""We need more towels in room 204.""But all in all, this film is not too bad, and I will add it to my collection.",3,Better than Blake Edwards Last Three Attempts to Revive The Series,1147910400,"05 18, 2006",2006,1848,"['admit', 'was', 'nervous', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'film', 'being', 'made', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'film', 'defined', 'French', 'Sterotype', 'have', 'today', 'untimely', 'death', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'did', 'everything', 'could', 'try', 'bring', 'series', 'back', 'life', 'even', 'attempting', 'three', 'films', 'process', 'one', 'using', 'unused', 'footage', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'using', 'unknown', 'actor', 'who', 'have', 'curse', 'Clusoe', 'had', 'also', 'bombed', 'was', 'lame', 'tried', 'use', 'real', 'comedian', 'Roberto', 'Benini', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'spelled', 'right', 'who', 'had', 'lines', 'physical', 'comedy', 'down', 'screenplay', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'performance', 'was', 'overshadowed.Enter', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'prequel', 'Oh', 'seemed', 'just', 'attempt', 'revive', 'dead', 'series', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'pulled', 'off', 'perhaps', 'making', 'decent', 'series', 'own', 'People', 'must', 'remember', 'original', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'was', 'worst', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'era', 'launched', 'unaticipated', 'sequel', 'Shot', 'Dark', 'vastly', 'superior', 'movie', 'original', 'side', 'note', 'was', 'Sellers', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'murder', 'mystery', 'based', 'play', 'was', 'contractually', 'obligated', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'brillant', 'idea', 'was', 'have', 'Sellers', 'play', 'Clusoe', 'film', 'rest', 'comedy', 'history.I', 'feel', 'Martin', 'could', 'do', 'sequels', 'could', 'be', 'even', 'funnier', 'rocky', 'often', 'funny', 'film', 'Just', 'Sellers', 'just', 'have', 'one', 'complaint', 'Martin', 'should', 'take', 'advice', 'use', 'future', 'next', 'time', 'fall', 'second', 'story', 'hotel', 'room', 'Lobby', 'counter', 'pop', 'up', 'now', 'infamous', 'line', 'made', 'Clusoe', 'funny', 'character', 'AHH', 'Felt', 'GOOD', 'vastly', 'more', 'hilarious', 'need', 'more', 'towels', 'room', '204', 'film', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'will', 'add', 'collection']",N/A
987455,A8LFXWE1VZ94A,B000FBH3V8,SylvesterFox007,"[5, 8]","Peter Sellers was Peter Sellers.  Steve Martin is Steve Martin.  In the same way, Steve Martin's Inspector Jacques Clouseau is a totally new creation, as uniquely Martin's as the original was uniquely Sellers'.  The essential details are the same: the ridiculous accent, the unique level of incompetence, the tendency to karate-chop the air on reflex.  But instead of trying to emulate Sellers, Martin fills out the character with his unique brand of goofiness.  By the end of the movie, I had totally accepted Steve Martin as the new Inspector Clouseau, never once trying to compare him to Peter Sellers.The film starts out with narration by Kevin Kline as Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom's character in the older films).  The narration contains a few groan-worthy clich&eacute;s but only exists long enough to set up the plot.  Kevin Kline sometimes struggles to keep his French accent straight, but he makes up for it later in the movie with his willingness to be the butt of several gags.The movie then moves to one of its highpoints: the credits.  An animated version of Steve Martin's Clouseau chases after the famous Pink Panther to a traditional rendition of Henry Mancini's theme.  The sequence is not only the cartoon cat's funniest appearance so far, but it's a treat for fans of the original films willing to indulge.  Several moments pay tribute to the animated sequences of the Peter Sellers films, including ""A Shot in the Dark.""Then the real movie begins.  Steve Martin shines as Inspector Clouseau, nailing the ridiculous accent perfectly.  It even varies slightly from Sellers'.  The plot is that of a conventional murder mystery, a nice change from the muddled plots of the previous movies.  It's even possible for the viewer to spot the clues.Steve Martin's Clouseau has been upgraded from mere idiot to idiot savant.  He's accident prone, absent minded, and slow on the uptake, but when he's got time to sit down and think it's not hard to believe he's capable of solving the case.Beyonce's character, while important to the plot, actually gets only a small amount of screen time.  Her role requires only average acting talent.  She may not be the most competent actress, but she is very competent when it comes to giving the camera absolutely smoldering stares.I found myself rooting for Martin to solve the case and get the girl.  No, not Beyonce.  Emily Mortimer as Dreyfus' scatterbrained secretary.  She and Martin have great chemisty, as do Martin and sidekick Jean Reno.  There's a genuine warmth between the trio, and an element of sentimentality that was missing from the original films.  The tired routines that were recycled so many times in the original films are thankfully gone, though there are several subtle nods to those familiar with the older films.  While, sadly, the movie never once reaches the level of hilarity the originals did, the laughs are steady, the story flows nicely, and the characters are extremely likable.  The movie may or may not appeal to fans of the original movies, but fans of Martin will definitely enjoy it and youngsters are guaranteed to be kept in stitches.",5,A Completely Different Panther,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,3132,"['Peter', 'Sellers', 'was', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'same', 'way', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Inspector', 'Jacques', 'Clouseau', 'totally', 'new', 'creation', 'uniquely', 'Martin', 'original', 'was', 'uniquely', 'Sellers', 'essential', 'details', 'are', 'same', 'ridiculous', 'accent', 'unique', 'level', 'incompetence', 'tendency', 'karate-chop', 'air', 'reflex', 'instead', 'trying', 'emulate', 'Sellers', 'Martin', 'out', 'character', 'unique', 'brand', 'goofiness', 'end', 'movie', 'had', 'totally', 'accepted', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'new', 'Inspector', 'Clouseau', 'never', 'once', 'trying', 'compare', 'Peter', 'Sellers.The', 'film', 'out', 'narration', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Dreyfus', 'Herbert', 'Lom', 'character', 'older', 'films', 'narration', 'few', 'groan-worthy', 'clich', 'eacute', 'only', 'long', 'enough', 'set', 'up', 'plot', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'sometimes', 'keep', 'French', 'accent', 'straight', 'up', 'later', 'movie', 'willingness', 'be', 'butt', 'several', 'gags.The', 'movie', 'then', 'one', 'highpoints', 'credits', 'animated', 'version', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Clouseau', 'famous', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'traditional', 'rendition', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'theme', 'sequence', 'not', 'only', 'cartoon', 'cat', 'funniest', 'appearance', 'so', 'far', 'treat', 'fans', 'original', 'films', 'willing', 'indulge', 'Several', 'moments', 'pay', 'tribute', 'animated', 'sequences', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'films', 'including', 'Shot', 'Dark', 'Then', 'real', 'movie', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'shines', 'Inspector', 'Clouseau', 'nailing', 'ridiculous', 'accent', 'perfectly', 'even', 'slightly', 'Sellers', 'plot', 'conventional', 'murder', 'mystery', 'nice', 'change', 'muddled', 'plots', 'previous', 'movies', 'even', 'possible', 'viewer', 'spot', 'clues.Steve', 'Martin', 'Clouseau', 'been', 'upgraded', 'mere', 'idiot', 'idiot', 'savant', 'accident', 'prone', 'absent', 'minded', 'slow', 'uptake', 'when', 'got', 'time', 'sit', 'down', 'think', 'not', 'hard', 'believe', 'capable', 'solving', 'case.Beyonce', 'character', 'important', 'plot', 'actually', 'only', 'small', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'role', 'only', 'average', 'acting', 'talent', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'competent', 'actress', 'very', 'competent', 'when', 'giving', 'camera', 'absolutely', 'smoldering', 'stares.I', 'found', 'rooting', 'Martin', 'solve', 'case', 'get', 'girl', 'No', 'not', 'Beyonce', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Dreyfus', 'scatterbrained', 'secretary', 'Martin', 'have', 'great', 'chemisty', 'do', 'Martin', 'sidekick', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'genuine', 'warmth', 'trio', 'element', 'sentimentality', 'was', 'missing', 'original', 'films', 'tired', 'routines', 'were', 'recycled', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'original', 'films', 'are', 'thankfully', 'gone', 'are', 'several', 'subtle', 'nods', 'familiar', 'older', 'films', 'sadly', 'movie', 'never', 'once', 'level', 'hilarity', 'originals', 'did', 'laughs', 'are', 'steady', 'story', 'nicely', 'characters', 'are', 'extremely', 'likable', 'movie', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'appeal', 'fans', 'original', 'movies', 'fans', 'Martin', 'will', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'youngsters', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'be', 'kept', 'stitches']",N/A

987458,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000FBH3V8,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 8]","Steve Martin has had a mixed year at the movies. First, the critically acclaimed ""Shop Girl"", then the successful, but dreadful ""Cheaper by the Dozen 2"", and now the mixed bag that is ""The Pink Panther"".Detective Clouseau (Steve Martin), a very inept cop in the French countryside, is summoned to Paris by Chief Inspector Dreyfuss (Kevin Kline). Dreyfuss wants Clouseau to distract the public, leading a fake investigation into the death of Yves Glouant (Jason Statham), the coach of the French soccer team. While Clouseau follows his leads, Dreyfuss will secretly lead the real investigation, find the killer, and receive the glory, the accolades and his long-awaited Medal of Honor. Dreyfuss pairs Clouseau with Ponton (Jean Reno) and they soon begin to investigate the murder of the star athlete, and the disappearance of the Pink Panther Diamond. Some of the suspects include Xania (Beyonce Knowles), international recording superstar (that's convenient!), Yuri (Henry Czerny), the Russian born trainer of the French team and many others.""The Pink Panther"", co-written by Steve Martin and directed by Shawn Levy, is a mixed-bag. Some of the set pieces are amusing, but the film is a pale comparison to the classic on which it is based.This new ""Panther"" isn't really based on the original film starring David Niven, Peter Sellers, Robert Wagner and many others. Nor is it based on any of the sequels starring Peter Sellers. What it is based on is the character of Inspector Clouseau, as played so brilliantly by the late, great Peter Sellers. Why do filmmakers believe they can improve upon original works of genius? This misconception has lead to remakes of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" and many others. These films are classics for a reason. Everyone involved in the film was firing on all cylinders, everything clicked and the film was great. You can't improve upon it. Stop trying and subjecting the public to endless hours of bad films. There are thousands of films that would be more suitable for updates, remakes, etc. Films that were good, but are maybe fading into our memories. Or films with an interesting premise but mediocre performances by people who would became memorable stars. Try remaking more of those.Because Martin and Levy aren't really remaking one of the films, this becomes more of an update or a reimagining. I read that this film is supposed to be a prequel to Peter Sellers' entries, but I don't see how that is possible when this story takes place in present day. Because Martin is basically reconceiving one of the most memorable comedic characters ever created, he has large shoes to fill. Martin is a funny guy and he manages to create some amusing sequences here, but the character never really seems fluid for him. He doesn't seem like he inhibits the life of this character. Everything seemed so effortless for Sellers. Martin is more successful in portraying Clouseau's physical bumbling than he is with the difficult to understand accent.Some of the physical humor is lifted directly from some of the original ""Panther"" films; a sequence in Xania's bathroom is borrowed from one of the sequels. Martin's Clouseau attempts to keep mentally sharp, by sporadically attacking people. However, Sellers' Clouseau confined this action to his willing servant, providing Blake Edwards and Sellers the opportunity to create more and more elaborately choreographed situations. In Martin's case, he decides to enlist the willing Ponton for this purpose, who quickly ends all of these attempts. Because the bits are so quick, they don't have time to build up to anything.  Clouseau also bumbles his way through many interrogations, while Ponton looks on helplessly. There is one particularly memorable little bit, late in the film, Clouseau and Ponton don disguises to infiltrate a party. The disguises are cute but pale in comparison to the elaborate costumes Seller wore. But Martin always seems a little at ease playing the bumbling detective. It doesn't seem natural for him and it did seem entirely natural for Sellers.Martin tries to assay the memorable linguistic problems Sellers gave Clouseau. While Sellers always seemed to be two or three degrees from normal, we always could get a sense of what he was trying to say; ""room"" became ""rhuum"". Martin takes the joke 20 degrees from the actual word and his Clouseau seems to be speaking a different language altogether. His attempts to say the word ""hamburger"" are amusing, but some of the variations Martin tries are so off the mark, it seems like he is making a joke of a joke, rather than trying something new or trying to be respectful of the original.Kevin Kline's Chief Inspector Dreyfuss is amusing in a low key way. We get the sense he might eventually come close to Herbert Lom's slow burn as the original Dreyfuss; there are definitely hints the character may eventually go crazy, as Lom's character did in one of the sequels.Jean Reno and Beyonce Knowles are pretty forgettable. Knowles is certainly beautiful and does an adequate job with her straight lines, but imagine how memorable the role might have been with a true comedian in the role. The finale, involving a performance from Xania, is entirely too calculated to provide an opportunity for Beyonce to sing and for the inevitable music video to play on MTV. Because the situation is so phony it is of no interest. If it appeared to be an organic moment in the film's story, it would make more sense and appear more natural.Emily Mortimer pops up as Clouseau's new secretary, Nicole. A slightly amusing character providing the actress with an unusual comedic turn. Henry Czerny and Kristin Chenoweth pop up in roles that are almost instantly forgettable.It's unfortunate that Martin is squandering his comedic talents on films like ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" and forgettable remakes like ""The Pink Panther"". Martin is a gifted comedic talent and should stick to the more interesting, thoughtful films like ""Roxanne"" and ""Shopgirl"". When he makes a film like ""The Pink Panther"", he is really dumbing down his humor. Also, his former core audience still remembers the classic portrayal of the same character by Peter Sellers. Perhaps, the filmmakers felt that the film would appeal to children, and many parents certainly took their kids to the screening I attended. I don't understand why parents, who are familiar with the better, funnier originals, wouldn't expose their kids to these films instead of this weak remake. Perhaps all of the publicity surrounding this new film is drawing children to it, his new core audience. The physical humor certainly translates into silly fun, worthy of the attention of an eight year old. A dumb eight year old. How much richer their lives would be after watching the original at work.If you have 90 minutes to kill, when the DVD is available, give it a try. But don't waste your hard earned money for a bargain matinee.",2,"Steve Martin's Wasted Comedic Talents or ""The Pink Panther""",1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,6934,"['Steve', 'Martin', 'had', 'mixed',

987462,A7D607LPOKWYD,B000FBH3V8,TJ Brown,"[1, 1]","Lots of people had lots of bones to pick with this one, but as the closing credits rolled I considered it time well spent. I laughed a few times, which is more than i can say for 95% of the ""comedies""  i have watched. Someone complained that the laughs were cheap, though they admitted to laughing at them. So now we are apologizing for laughing?  Or getting miffed at a movie for making us laugh at things we, in retrospect, find dumb?Did I think on the surface that the Pink Panther entity needed to be revisited?  No. Did I find the idea worthy of a raised eyebrow?  Yes. A frown too. But upon further review did I decide to watch it all these years later?  Yup. And finally, did I enjoy it?  Absolutely I did.I am heartened to not only see the franchise had a second offering (a fact which completely sailed by my head) but that the reviews for that one are much more positive than the reviews for this one. This movie is really split across the board. I am joining in with a heap of others on the 5 star review, but there are lots of 1 star reviews. I want to pick through them and see how many people disparaged the flick even while admitting to laughing at the jokes.  There are even some offended at the legacy of the Sellers classics which is simply hogwash. This one stood on its own and was not a simple remake of one of the Panther classics that will always stand on its own.Steve Martin was very good. His physical comedy is always worth a guffaw, and he had a nice spin on comedic Clouseau mannerisms. I had no problems with his portrayal of the character, and in fact enjoyed much more than I thought I would.  As I did not go in to this daring the movie to entertain me and went in simply to have a good time, it ended in a good result for me.So, in sumnation, what I thought was a bad idea all along was better than advertised for me, and I liked it and I will end up watching it again. Farces like this and another Steve Martin gem (The Jerk) are even funnier with repeated viewings.

The notion of making a Pink Panther film without Peter Sellers is a ridiculous one, but the notion of casting Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau is even more ridiculous.  Sure enough, Martin is atrocious as Closeau.  Kevin Kline is not much better as Chief Inspector Dreyfuss.  If there's anyone in the cast that gives a good performance, it's Jean Reno as Clouseau's assistant.The script, by Len Blum and Martin himself, is horrible.  The jokes are completely unfunny.  People slam into things, damage is done, Martin makes a fool of himself; there's even a nice fart joke thrown in for the kids.  Even kids, however, won't find this film very funny.  The plot immediately negates all of the Sellers films, while the murderer is obvious from the start.  The good point of the film was Clive Owen, who has a few short scenes as Agent 006.  James Bond fans will realize that Owen was the top contender for the role of 007 in CASINO ROYALE, though the part eventually went to Daniel Craig.  I originally was a top supporter of Owen as Bond, and thus I loved getting a glimpse of what his James Bond may have been like.Christophe Beck, who composed outstanding music for the television series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, delivers a completely unextraodinary score.  It's indistinguishable from any other average Hollywood score, which is a pity.  Even Henry Mancini's delightful theme seems misused and hokey here.THE PINK PANTHER is a dumb, dumb film which tries way too hard to make people laugh.  There's nary a brain in its head.

987464,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000FBH3V8,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 1]","The latest and least unsuccessful post-Peter Sellers incarnation of The Pink Panther isn't a particularly good movie, but it's certainly a lot better than Blake Edwards last three disastrous bloody-minded attempts to prove that he was the genius of the series and didn't need Sellers (who, to be fair, had he lived was planning to pull the same stunt on Edwards by replacing him with Clive Donner). Steve Martin certainly doesn't make the part his own but at least he fares better than Roberto Begnini, though the accent is wrong in all the unfunny ways. It doesn't need to be a Sellers impression, but remotely amusing would have been nice, especially since director Shawn Levy hasn't a clue how to stage a decent pratfall, rendering much of the physical comedy lukewarm.Along with being the only one of the series not to be shot in Scope, most of the old faithful setups of the series are discarded - Kevin Kline's rather flat Dreyfuss isn't trying to kill Clouseau all the time (no nervous tic or accidental dismemberment either) and Kato isn't constantly attacking him (though this is reworked as Clouseau constantly attempting to attack his assistant, who effortlessly pre-empts him every time) - with not enough new to fill in the void they leave. Indeed, in a sign of its troubled post-production that saw it shelved for the best part of a year, one of the one of the funniest scenes (a surreal airplane sequence that has nothing to do with the plot) got deleted, as did Dreyfuss' motive for bringing in Clouseau to the case, but at least they're both in the DVD extras.Sadly, Jean Reno is almost entirely wasted as Clouseau's sidekick in the film. Looking like he's just had plastic surgery (it's easy to understand why he avoids the clean shaven look: it's scary in a faceless man kind of way), his only genuinely funny moment is a brief dance routine, which at least puts him one up on the one of the film's unbilled guest stars. In a cameo as a thinly disguised James Bond (""006. You know what that means?"" ""You're one away from the big time?""), Clive Owen proves that while he may have all the dramatic ability of a block of wood with woodworm in `serious' films, when it comes to comedy he's even worse (think Charlton Heston in trying-to-prove-he-has-a-sense-of-humor mode, only much worse). His delivery of even the simplest lines is astonishingly stilted even by his standards, making you wonder if he's unable to speak English unless it's spelt out for him phonetically. Still, if nothing else his leaden touch proves what an unmitigated catastrophe he would have been as 007, and it's a fairly brief moment in a film that's watchable with a few laughs. There's no reason to watch it other than completism, but there's a lot worse out there.",3,Not a disaster but not particularly good,1179532800,"05 19, 2007",2007,2758,"['latest', 'least', 'unsuccessful', 'post-Peter', 'Sellers', 'incarnation', 'Pink', 'Panther', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'good', 'movie', 'certainly', 'lot', 'better', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'last', 'three', 'disastrous', 'bloody-minded', 'attempts', 'prove', 'was', 'genius', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'Sellers', 'who', 'be', 'fair', 'had', 'lived', 'was', 'planning', 'pull', 'same', 'stunt', 'Edwards', 'replacing', 'Clive', 'Donner', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'make', 'part', 'own', 'least', 'better', 'Roberto', 'Begnini', 'accent', 'wrong', 'unfunny', 'ways', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'Sellers', 'impression', 'remotely', 'amusing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'especially', 'director', 'Shawn', 'Levy', ""n't"", 'clue', 'how', 'stage', 'decent', 'pratfall', 'rendering', 'much', 'physical', 'comedy', 'lukewarm.Along', 'being', 'only', 'one', 'series', 'not', 'be', 'shot', 'Scope', 'most', 'old', 'faithful', 'setups', 'series', 'are', 'discarded', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'rather', 'flat', 'Dreyfuss', ""n't"", 'trying', 'kill', 'Clouseau', 'time', 'nervous', 'tic', 'accidental', 'dismemberment', 'Kato', ""n't"", 'constantly', 'attacking', 'reworked', 'Clouseau', 'constantly', 'attempting', 'attack', 'assistant', 'who', 'effortlessly', 'pre-empts', 'time', 'not', 'enough', 'new', 'fill', 'void', 'leave', 'Indeed', 'sign', 'troubled', 'post-production', 'saw', 'shelved', 'best', 'part', 'year', 'one', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'surreal', 'airplane', 'sequence', 'nothing', 'do', 'plot', 'got', 'deleted', 'did', 'Dreyfuss', 'motive', 'bringing', 'Clouseau', 'case', 'least', ""'re"", 'DVD', 'extras.Sadly', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'almost', 'entirely', 'wasted', 'Clouseau', 'sidekick', 'film', 'Looking', 'just', 'had', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'clean', 'shaven', 'look', 'scary', 'faceless', 'man', 'kind', 'way', 'only', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moment', 'brief', 'dance', 'routine', 'least', 'puts', 'one', 'up', 'one', 'film', 'unbilled', 'guest', 'stars', 'cameo', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'James', 'Bond', '006', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'one', 'away', 'big', 'time', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'may', 'have', 'dramatic', 'ability', 'block', 'wood', 'woodworm', 'serious', 'films', 'when', 'comedy', 'even', 'worse', 'think', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'trying-to-prove-he-has-a-sense-of-humor', 'mode', 'only', 'much', 'worse', 'delivery', 'even', 'simplest', 'lines', 'astonishingly', 'stilted', 'even', 'standards', 'making', 'wonder', 'unable', 'speak', 'English', 'spelt', 'out', 'phonetically', 'Still', 'nothing', 'else', 'leaden', 'touch', 'what', 'unmitigated', 'catastrophe', 'would', 'have', 'been', '007', 'fairly', 'brief', 'moment', 'film', 'watchable', 'few', 'laughs', 'reason', 'watch', 'other', 'completism', 'lot', 'worse', 'there']",N/A

987466,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000FBH3V8,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","I know it's not fair to compare Steve Martin with Peter Sellers. I know Seller's character in the original `Pink Panther' series is, and will be, literally inimitable. Now, one reasonable decision the Hollywood studios made when remaking this cult classic comedy is that they chose Steve Martin, not Mike Meyers nor Jim Carrey. And surely the new Clouseau played by Steve Martin delivers the goods. I am ready to admit that.Still, even Steve Martin cannot save the unoriginal and unimaginative script. I didn't say `unfunny' because some scenes are definitely funny, with Martin who knows what he is doing. But the film director and producers fail to realize that we need more than one talented actor to make a film. The thin and weak story about the missing diamond and a murder of football coach can be OK if only the filmmakers give us what we want. No, they substituted Burt Kwouk's Cato and the Inspector's ultra-ridiculous and most hilarious `fights', with unmemorable sidekick played by dull Jean Reno. Herbert Lom's Dreyfus is played by Kevin Kline with heavy French accent, but unlike Martin, Kline's monotonous turn gets more and more tired after repeating his mannerism.But the worst is the inept hand of director Shawn Levy, who previously did two so-so comedies (Just Married' and `Cheaper by the Dozen'). Sorry to say this, but the job of re-imagining the 'Panther' legacy seems to be too much for him. From the very opening cartoon section, which is not the funniest animation I've seen these days, the series of uninspired and unoriginal gags suggest the lack of ideas. With several not-so-original slapsticks, the film has only mediocre gags that can be done elsewhere. Casting of Emily Mortimer as French secretary could be more interesting, but the film is content with using her in a few middling jokes, and as to Beyonc? Knowles, who was sensational in the second `Austin Powers' sequel, she is only required to look beautiful and sing a song. Brief cameo from Clive Owen is fun to see, but sadly his James Bond parody, funny as it is, is irrelevant to the legacy of Clouseau.I don't say `The Pink Panther' is totally unfunny. I only say, Steve Martin's comic interpretation aside, there is no point in assembling the talented actors for the pointless remake of the classic comedy series, which we have seen already enough in the past 40 years, and those clich?d gags and forgettable characters cannot justify the resurrection of Inspector Clouseau.",2,Steve Martin Is Game But the Film and Its Gags Are Mostly Uninspired and Forgettable,1147478400,"05 13, 2006",2006,2470,"['know', 'not', 'fair', 'compare', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'know', 'Seller', 'character', 'original', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'literally', 'inimitable', 'Now', 'one', 'reasonable', 'decision', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'made', 'when', 'remaking', 'cult', 'classic', 'comedy', 'chose', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'not', 'Mike', 'Meyers', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'surely', 'new', 'Clouseau', 'played', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'goods', 'am', 'ready', 'admit', 'that.Still', 'even', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'unoriginal', 'unimaginative', 'script', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'unfunny', 'scenes', 'are', 'definitely', 'funny', 'Martin', 'who', 'what', 'doing', 'film', 'director', 'producers', 'fail', 'realize', 'need', 'more', 'one', 'talented', 'actor', 'make', 'film', 'thin', 'weak', 'story', 'missing', 'diamond', 'murder', 'football', 'coach', 'can', 'be', 'OK', 'only', 'filmmakers', 'give', 'what', 'want', 'No', 'substituted', 'Burt', 'Kwouk', 'Cato', 'Inspector', 'ultra-ridiculous', 'most', 'hilarious', 'fights', 'unmemorable', 'sidekick', 'played', 'dull', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'Herbert', 'Lom', 'Dreyfus', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'heavy', 'French', 'accent', 'Martin', 'Kline', 'monotonous', 'turn', 'more', 'more', 'tired', 'repeating', 'mannerism.But', 'worst', 'inept', 'hand', 'director', 'Shawn', 'Levy', 'who', 'previously', 'did', 'two', 'so-so', 'comedies', 'Just', 'Married', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'Sorry', 'say', 'job', 're-imagining', ""'Panther"", 'legacy', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'very', 'opening', 'cartoon', 'section', 'not', 'funniest', 'animation', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'days', 'series', 'uninspired', 'unoriginal', 'gags', 'suggest', 'lack', 'ideas', 'several', 'not-so-original', 'slapsticks', 'film', 'only', 'mediocre', 'gags', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'elsewhere', 'Casting', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'French', 'secretary', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'film', 'content', 'using', 'few', 'middling', 'jokes', 'Beyonc', 'Knowles', 'who', 'was', 'sensational', 'second', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'sequel', 'only', 'required', 'look', 'beautiful', 'sing', 'song', 'Brief', 'cameo', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'fun', 'see', 'sadly', 'James', 'Bond', 'parody', 'funny', 'irrelevant', 'legacy', 'Clouseau.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'totally', 'unfunny', 'only', 'say', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'comic', 'interpretation', 'aside', 'point', 'assembling', 'talented', 'actors', 'pointless', 'remake', 'classic', 'comedy', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'already', 'enough', 'past', '40', 'years', 'clich', 'd', 'gags', 'forgettable', 'characters', 'can', 'not', 'justify', 'resurrection', 'Inspector', 'Clouseau']",N/A
987467,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B000FBH3V8,Tucker Andersen,"[2, 4]","WARNING: This film is not to be taken seriously. Neither should film fans expect it to compare with the immensely successful original PINK PANTHER series starring Peter Sellers. Rather it is a vehicle adapted to showcase Steve Martin which borrows the idea of a bumbling French police inspector named Jacques Clouseau to attract moviegoers with the instant name recognition and warm fuzzy feeling which the title provides.However, if you just want to have fun at the theater and either have no familiarity with the original series or can set aside the natural tendency to compare the script, direction and Martin's Clouseau in this version with Sellers in the original, this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie with loads of laugh out loud moments. Also, the brief animated segment with the instantly recognizable Pink Panther strutting his stuff during the opening credits certainly recalls the lovable creature made famous in the Blake Edwards' films before the time when such computer animation had become as inexpensive and commonplace as it is today.The storyline is very simple, and anything more than a brief review would imply that this movie is something more than what it is intended to be - light entertainment. The coach of the French National Soccer Team is murdered before thousands of fans at the conclusion of a rousing match and his ring in which is mounted the legendary diamond THE PINK PANTHER disappears during the confusion which follows. Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) recognizes both the political risk and opportunity which the case presents. With great fanfare he announces that Inspector Clouseau (Steve Martin) will be in charge of the investigatin, which Dreyfus believes will deflect criticism from him if there are problems and at the same time allow him to quietly attempt to solve the case behind the scenes. Of course, the situation doesn't develop as planned, with Clouseau getting credit for a cracking a major wave of robberies and stealing the limelight from Dreyfus. Other prominent cast members include Jean Reno as Gendarme Ponton, assigned to be Clouseau's police aide by Dreyfus in order to keep track of his investigation; Beyonce' as Xania, the girlfriend of the murdered coach, and Emily Mortimer as Clouseau's office assistant. They all perform their roles well but their talents are uniformly underutilized since in all cases they are simply foils for Steve Martin, whose performance is the almost complete focus of the film. Fortunately, Martin succeeds, but if you are not one of his fans you should not bother to see this movie.Humor abounds! There are excellent one liners, wonderful misdirection, slapstick, farce and lots of physical humor. Martin's Clouseau is a mixture of witlessness and occasional flashes of naive intelligence and great common sense. Of course, since this is a feel good comedy, you know before the movie starts that eventually the villain will be identified, that good will triumph over evil, and that Clouseau will be vindicated and emerge a hero, but you don't know who or how until the conclusion. Martin's French accent is fun, but his attempt as Clouseau to perfect his English diction in order to travel incognito to the United States is priceless. I never realized there were so many ways to mispronounce hamburger (and yet enjoy your first exposure to this gastronomic delight so thoroughly). I may never be able to walk through the lobby of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel again without visualizing the consequences of Closeau's visit with Xania and the chaos which ensued.In summary, despite being a Steve Martin fan, I acknowledge that perhaps my expectations had been lowered by the many critical reviews of this film. Nevertheless, whatever the reasons I was very pleasantly surprised and enjoyed myself immensely while watching this movie. And the seemingly brief just over 90 minute length was an advantage in that the director could just keep the gags coming and the story moving and had no need to pad the story in any way. While this film will certainly never be considered a classic, I will enjoy watching it again occasionally when it makes it to television, and  I recommend it strongly if you like light comedy and slapstick and enjoy Steve Martin.Tucker Andersen",4,(3 1/2)  SIMPLY FUN!,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,4259,"['WARNING', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'should', 'film', 'fans', 'expect', 'compare', 'immensely', 'successful', 'original', 'PINK', 'PANTHER', 'series', 'starring', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Rather', 'vehicle', 'adapted', 'showcase', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'idea', 'bumbling', 'French', 'police', 'inspector', 'named', 'Jacques', 'Clouseau', 'attract', 'moviegoers', 'instant', 'name', 'recognition', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'feeling', 'title', 'provides.However', 'just', 'want', 'have', 'fun', 'theater', 'have', 'familiarity', 'original', 'series', 'can', 'set', 'aside', 'natural', 'tendency', 'compare', 'script', 'direction', 'Martin', 'Clouseau', 'version', 'Sellers', 'original', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'loads', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'Also', 'brief', 'animated', 'segment', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'strutting', 'stuff', 'opening', 'certainly', 'lovable', 'creature', 'made', 'famous', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'films', 'time', 'when', 'such', 'computer', 'animation', 'had', 'become', 'inexpensive', 'commonplace', 'today.The', 'storyline', 'very', 'simple', 'anything', 'more', 'brief', 'review', 'would', 'imply', 'movie', 'something', 'more', 'what', 'intended', 'be', 'light', 'entertainment', 'coach', 'French', 'National', 'Soccer', 'Team', 'murdered', 'thousands', 'fans', 'conclusion', 'rousing', 'match', 'ring', 'mounted', 'legendary', 'diamond', 'THE', 'PINK', 'PANTHER', 'confusion', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Dreyfus', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'political', 'risk', 'opportunity', 'case', 'great', 'fanfare', 'Inspector', 'Clouseau', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'will', 'be', 'charge', 'investigatin', 'Dreyfus', 'will', 'deflect', 'criticism', 'are', 'problems', 'same', 'time', 'allow', 'quietly', 'attempt', 'solve', 'case', 'scenes', 'course', 'situation', ""n't"", 'develop', 'planned', 'Clouseau', 'getting', 'credit', 'cracking', 'major', 'wave', 'robberies', 'stealing', 'limelight', 'Dreyfus', 'Other', 'prominent', 'cast', 'members', 'include', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'Gendarme', 'Ponton', 'assigned', 'be', 'Clouseau', 'police', 'aide', 'Dreyfus', 'order', 'keep', 'track', 'investigation', 'Beyonce', 'Xania', 'girlfriend', 'murdered', 'coach', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Clouseau', 'office', 'assistant', 'perform', 'roles', 'well', 'talents', 'are', 'uniformly', 'underutilized', 'cases', 'are', 'simply', 'foils', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'performance', 'almost', 'complete', 'focus', 'film', 'Fortunately', 'Martin', 'are', 'not', 'one', 'fans', 'should', 'not', 'bother', 'see', 'movie.Humor', 'are', 'excellent', 'one', 'liners', 'wonderful', 'misdirection', 'slapstick', 'farce', 'lots', 'physical', 'humor', 'Martin', 'Clouseau', 'mixture', 'witlessness', 'occasional', 'flashes', 'naive', 'intelligence', 'great', 'common', 'sense', 'course', 'feel', 'good', 'comedy', 'know', 'movie', 'eventually', 'villain', 'will', 'be', 'identified', 'good', 'will', 'triumph', 'evil', 'Clouseau', 'will', 'be', 'vindicated', 'emerge', 'hero', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'how', 'conclusion', 'Martin', 'French', 'accent', 'fun', 'attempt', 'Clouseau', 'perfect', 'English', 'diction', 'order', 'travel', 'incognito', 'United', 'States', 'priceless', 'never', 'realized', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'mispronounce', 'hamburger', 'yet', 'enjoy', 'first', 'exposure', 'gastronomic', 'delight', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'walk', 'lobby', 'Waldorf', 'Astoria', 'Hotel', 'again', 'visualizing', 'consequences', 'Closeau', 'visit', 'Xania', 'chaos', 'ensued.In', 'summary', 'being', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'fan', 'acknowledge', 'perhaps', 'expectations', 'had', 'been', 'lowered', 'many', 'critical', 'reviews', 'film', 'Nevertheless', 'reasons', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'watching', 'movie', 'seemingly', 'brief', 'just', '90', 'minute', 'length', 'was', 'advantage', 'director', 'could', 'just', 'keep', 'gags', 'coming', 'story', 'moving', 'had', 'need', 'pad', 'story', 'way', 'film', 'will', 'certainly', 'never', 'be', 'considered', 'classic', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'again', 'occasionally', 'when', 'television', 'recommend', 'strongly', 'like', 'light', 'comedy', 'slapstick', 'enjoy', 'Steve', 'Martin.Tucker', 'Andersen']",N/A

It can't be good, because this film is so bad. No one is doing good work, so they can't be happy. But who is causing the problems? Director Shawn Levy? Writer and star Steve Martin?Anyone who saw Kevin Kline in A FISH CALLED WANDA knows how funny he can be. But in THE PINK PANTHER, he seems almost bored. He is in and out of character - as well as accent - so often that it's difficult to determine just what Chief Inspector Dreyfus is supposed to be: surely not funny, and surely not French. In the original, he is definitely French, and Clouseau is definitely driving him crazy - but not in this version. Here he gets beat up a lot; but that's not what made the Dreyfus character funny in the original - it was his borderline insanity.While Steve Martin seems sincere in his efforts as Inspector Clouseau, they fall flat because the writing - which he shared in - isn't funny. He doesn't understand slapstick, which is the type of humor used in the original PINK PANTHERS - and with good reason, given Inspector Clouseau's proneness to accident. He doesn't even understand his own character. Clouseau is supposed to be a self-deluded dim wit: he believes he's a great detective, but he's anything but. He bungles everything, is oblivious to clues that are right under his nose, and when he does something right, it is purely by accident. Not in this film. In this version, Clouseau actually solves the murder mystery through his powers of observation and deductive reasoning, as well as his knowledge of Chinese. That totally destroys the entire premise upon which the Clouseau character is based!I have to scratch my head and wonder who didn't get it most: director Shawn Levy, writer-actor Steve Martin, the producers - who? I know that remakes are difficult, and especially the remake of two comic geniuses like Blake Edwards, who directed the originals, and Peter Sellers, the original Clouseau. But why didn't they take their cue from the originals and stick to what worked? Now there is an entire generation that will think the PINK PANTHER movies are dumb - as the reviews already indicate. But the originals weren't dumb: they were comic genius at it's best.Just about the only thing in this film that resembles the originals are the names of the two main characters and the fact that most of the story takes place in France. It does use the wonderful Henry Mancini theme music in the beginning. But the story opens with a soccer coach owning the world's largest diamond, the Pink Panther, and wearing it to a soccer game! That's not funny: it's ridiculous, as most everything else in this film is. I don't think Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers need worry about losing their rightful places in film history, or being forgotten. But this film will soon be forgotten, as it quickly finds its rightful place in the discount bin of your local DVD store.Waitsel Smith",1,EMBARRASSINGLY UNFUNNY REMAKE OF 60'S CLASSIC,1151020800,"06 23, 2006",2006,3018,"['would', 'be', 'interesting', 'know', 'REAL', 'story', 'making', 'movie', 'REAL', 'reason', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'reluctance', 'release', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'film', 'so', 'bad', 'one', 'doing', 'good', 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'happy', 'who', 'causing', 'problems', 'Director', 'Shawn', 'Levy', 'Writer', 'star', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Anyone', 'who', 'saw', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'A', 'FISH', 'CALLED', 'WANDA', 'how', 'funny', 'can', 'be', 'THE', 'PINK', 'PANTHER', 'almost', 'bored', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'accent', 'so', 'often', 'difficult', 'determine', 'just', 'what', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Dreyfus', 'supposed', 'be', 'surely', 'not', 'funny', 'surely', 'not', 'French', 'original', 'definitely', 'French', 'Clouseau', 'definitely', 'driving', 'crazy', 'not', 'version', 'Here', 'beat', 'up', 'lot', 'not', 'what', 'made', 'Dreyfus', 'character', 'funny', 'original', 'was', 'borderline', 'insanity.While', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'sincere', 'efforts', 'Inspector', 'Clouseau', 'fall', 'flat', 'writing', 'shared', ""n't"", 'funny', ""n't"", 'understand', 'slapstick', 'type', 'humor', 'used', 'original', 'PINK', 'PANTHERS', 'good', 'reason', 'given', 'Inspector', 'Clouseau', 'proneness', 'accident', ""n't"", 'even', 'understand', 'own', 'character', 'Clouseau', 'supposed', 'be', 'self-deluded', 'dim', 'wit', 'great', 'detective', 'anything', 'everything', 'oblivious', 'clues', 'are', 'right', 'nose', 'when', 'something', 'right', 'purely', 'accident', 'Not', 'film', 'version', 'Clouseau', 'actually', 'murder', 'mystery', 'powers', 'observation', 'deductive', 'reasoning', 'as', 'well', 'knowledge', 'Chinese', 'totally', 'entire', 'premise', 'upon', 'Clouseau', 'character', 'based', 'have', 'scratch', 'head', 'wonder', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'most', 'director', 'Shawn', 'Levy', 'writer-actor', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'producers', 'who', 'know', 'remakes', 'are', 'difficult', 'especially', 'remake', 'two', 'comic', 'geniuses', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'who', 'directed', 'originals', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'original', 'Clouseau', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'cue', 'originals', 'stick', 'what', 'worked', 'Now', 'entire', 'generation', 'will', 'think', 'PINK', 'PANTHER', 'movies', 'are', 'dumb', 'reviews', 'already', 'indicate', 'originals', 'were', ""n't"", 'dumb', 'were', 'comic', 'genius', 'best.Just', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'originals', 'are', 'names', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'fact', 'most', 'story', 'place', 'France', 'use', 'wonderful', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'theme', 'music', 'beginning', 'story', 'soccer', 'coach', 'owning', 'world', 'largest', 'diamond', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'wearing', 'soccer', 'game', 'not', 'funny', 'ridiculous', 'most', 'everything', 'else', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'need', 'worry', 'losing', 'rightful', 'places', 'film', 'history', 'being', 'forgotten', 'film', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'forgotten', 'quickly', 'rightful', 'place', 'discount', 'bin', 'local', 'DVD', 'store.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A
