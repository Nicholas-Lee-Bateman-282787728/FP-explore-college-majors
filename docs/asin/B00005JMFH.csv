It has beautiful animation and the story is just as beautiful.However, Disney didn't make this quite as good of a ""kid"" movie as usual. Normally Disney is able to produce a story that adults and children alike enjoy and understand- but I just think this went too far above children's heads for them to comprehend the story that was really being told here.Other than that, the movie is entertaining and well done.  The story is of 3 indian brothers, the youngest of whom, Kenai, is trying to make his mark and be recognized as a man. When a bear eats their food, Kenai goes after it. He is unsuccessful in killing the bear and his oldest brother, Sitka, is killed in the process of trying to rescue Kenai. Kenai again goes after the bear to avenge his brother's death-this is where the true story begins. The spirit of Sitka turns Kenai into a bear himself, so that he can see thru new eyes. I don't want to spoil it for you, so I'll stop there.It is worth seeing and a wonderful movie...just don't expect it to be one of your kids' favorites until they can understand it a little better.1smileycat :-)",4,More for adults than children.,1070496000,"12 4, 2003",2003,1143,"['Bear', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'story', 'just', 'beautiful.However', 'Disney', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'quite', 'good', 'kid', 'movie', 'usual', 'Normally', 'Disney', 'able', 'produce', 'story', 'adults', 'children', 'alike', 'enjoy', 'understand-', 'just', 'think', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'children', 'heads', 'comprehend', 'story', 'was', 'really', 'being', 'told', 'here.Other', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'well', 'done', 'story', '3', 'indian', 'brothers', 'youngest', 'whom', 'Kenai', 'trying', 'make', 'mark', 'be', 'recognized', 'man', 'When', 'bear', 'food', 'Kenai', 'unsuccessful', 'killing', 'bear', 'oldest', 'brother', 'Sitka', 'killed', 'process', 'trying', 'rescue', 'Kenai', 'Kenai', 'again', 'bear', 'avenge', 'brother', 'death-this', 'where', 'true', 'story', 'begins', 'spirit', 'Sitka', 'Kenai', 'bear', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'thru', 'new', 'eyes', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'so', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'there.It', 'worth', 'seeing', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'one', 'kids', 'favorites', 'can', 'understand', 'little', 'better.1smileycat']",N/A

It is not a bad movie, but the story is VERY predictable.  This means that the only people who will enjoy this movie are very young kids.  There are some really laugh out loud moments involving the mooses, and one scene with the newly transformed bear were reminisce of those old Disney shorts about the bears and the park ranger.  Unfortunately, those were the only good things an adult will find amusing.  Whether about 10 mins of laugh will make this a good movie for you is a matter of personal choice.  I find the movie wanting.  You know the movie is in trouble when there were SO many songs.  There was simply not enough story to fill up the screen time.

Definately not movies worthy of being in the Platinum Collection (wich includes to date Snow White, Beauty and the Beast, and the Lion King). Brother Bear was so unexpected. I guessed that Disney was trying to cash in on the success of Tarzan (the other Disney film with music by Phil Collins), but the two are nothing alike. I went into the movie thinking the plot would be man turns into a bear resulting in good family fun. There is so much more to it. I really don't want to give anything away because the story takes you through so many surprises. The moose and the young bear, koda, definately steal the show, but you really do care for Kenai, the man who turns into a bear. I think Disney should have released this film after Home On The Range, the next and last Disney hand animated movie. That way they could go out with a bang. Home on the Range looks good, but good like Emporors New Groove was good. I really hope they change their mind and make more hand drawn, because I get sick of computer animation after a while.

618091,AOIFDXORCPXUO,B00005JMFH,Alicia White,"[1, 3]","This was a unique story with complex characters.  Beautiful scenary and well-done animation.We are shown a cultural rite of a tribe in Alska.  Kenai is about to get his totem.  A totem is an animal and characteristic which is to guide you.  The shaman conducts the ceremony and passes along what the spirits tell her is your totem.  Kenai was hoping for a cool totem, but gets The Bear of Love.  He hates bears and how uncool is it that his totem is love?  His older brother even makes fun of him [""kenai loves me, he loves me not.]Kenai's oldest brother explains that HIS totem was the eagle of guidance and he thought it was weird too.  But, then he realized he was to guide his younger brothers.  He assures Kenai that when his life is guided by his totem, he will become a man.I really enjoyed the peek into the culture and I LOVE the idea of a totem.  [I want one too!!!  I'd like to know what's supposed to be guiding my life so I can be a real grown-up woman, instead of pretending, eh?]I'm not going to spoil the whole movie, so I'll let you watch and find out what happens. The moose in the film are very funny.  Remember the SNL skits with the Canadians ""Eh?""  Well, it's even funnier when the Canadians are moose.  I think some of it went over the kids' heads, but the adults laughed.The smaller bear Kenai traveled with, Koda, is amusing as well.  His character is well-played.  The dialogue is good.  The film does a great job of making you feel as though you are seeing things through an animal's eye.Some points to consider:It takes roughly an hour of film before the main character, Kenai, is turned into a bear.  If you saw The Emperor's New Groove you'll recall the main character became a goat pretty quickly into the story.  I think the kids were expecting Kenai to become a bear pretty quickly as well.  Although I was fine with the delay, my children were anxious for the transformation to happen.The essential points are the movie are really pretty deep for children.  I'm not one who feels that they have to get EVERYTHING in a movie, but seriously, I think the point of the film didn't hit with them at all.My 5 year old was scared during several of the bear/hunter scenes.  Personally, I didn't think they were horribly scary, but he did complain of being frightened.  I don't think he is scarred for life, though. ;-)My 5 year old lost some interest before the film ended.  My three year old was over it an hour in and began ambling up and down the center aisle with some other toddlers--but this is to be expected.  My 5 year old child asked, ""When is this over?"" When there was roughly 30 minutes left.  HOWEVER, he did NOT want to leave.  He did want to stay and see it through.So, make your own judgements.  It's not a bad movie.  I don't think it's excessively violent.  I wasn't bothered by the music at all as some other reviewers were.  I do think the film has a positive message and it touched on some interesting things I am still thinking about afterward, but these themes are too advanced for children.  Can they enjoy the film anyway?  I think so.  Will it be their favorite movie ever?  Probably not.  But, not every film you see, has to be your favorite.",3,Brother Bear: a spiritual journey,1069632000,"11 24, 2003",2003,3196,"['was', 'unique', 'story', 'complex', 'characters', 'Beautiful', 'scenary', 'well-done', 'animation.We', 'are', 'shown', 'cultural', 'rite', 'tribe', 'Alska', 'Kenai', 'get', 'totem', 'totem', 'animal', 'characteristic', 'guide', 'shaman', 'ceremony', 'along', 'what', 'spirits', 'tell', 'totem', 'Kenai', 'was', 'hoping', 'cool', 'totem', 'Bear', 'Love', 'bears', 'how', 'uncool', 'totem', 'love', 'older', 'brother', 'even', 'fun', '[', 'kenai', 'not', ']', 'Kenai', 'oldest', 'brother', 'HIS', 'totem', 'was', 'eagle', 'guidance', 'thought', 'was', 'weird', 'too', 'then', 'realized', 'was', 'guide', 'younger', 'brothers', 'Kenai', 'when', 'life', 'guided', 'totem', 'will', 'become', 'man.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'peek', 'culture', 'LOVE', 'idea', 'totem', 'want', 'one', 'too', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'guiding', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'real', 'grown-up', 'woman', 'instead', 'pretending', 'eh', ']', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'whole', 'movie', 'so', ""'ll"", 'let', 'watch', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'moose', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'Remember', 'SNL', 'skits', 'Canadians', 'Eh', 'Well', 'even', 'funnier', 'when', 'Canadians', 'are', 'moose', 'think', 'went', 'kids', 'heads', 'adults', 'laughed.The', 'smaller', 'bear', 'Kenai', 'traveled', 'Koda', 'amusing', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'well-played', 'dialogue', 'good', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'feel', 'are', 'seeing', 'things', 'animal', 'eye.Some', 'points', 'consider', 'roughly', 'hour', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'Kenai', 'turned', 'bear', 'saw', 'Emperor', 'New', 'Groove', ""'ll"", 'recall', 'main', 'character', 'became', 'goat', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'story', 'think', 'kids', 'were', 'expecting', 'Kenai', 'become', 'bear', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'fine', 'delay', 'children', 'were', 'anxious', 'transformation', 'happen.The', 'essential', 'points', 'are', 'movie', 'are', 'really', 'pretty', 'deep', 'children', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'who', 'have', 'get', 'EVERYTHING', 'movie', 'seriously', 'think', 'point', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'all.My', '5', 'year', 'old', 'was', 'scared', 'several', 'bear/hunter', 'scenes', 'Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'were', 'horribly', 'scary', 'did', 'complain', 'being', 'frightened', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'scarred', 'life', 'though', '5', 'year', 'old', 'lost', 'interest', 'film', 'ended', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'was', 'hour', 'began', 'ambling', 'up', 'center', 'aisle', 'other', 'toddlers', 'be', 'expected', '5', 'year', 'old', 'child', 'asked', 'When', 'When', 'was', 'roughly', '30', 'minutes', 'left', 'HOWEVER', 'did', 'NOT', 'want', 'leave', 'did', 'want', 'stay', 'see', 'through.So', 'make', 'own', 'judgements', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'excessively', 'violent', 'was', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'music', 'other', 'reviewers', 'were', 'do', 'think', 'film', 'positive', 'message', 'touched', 'interesting', 'things', 'am', 'still', 'thinking', 'afterward', 'themes', 'are', 'too', 'advanced', 'children', 'Can', 'enjoy', 'film', 'anyway', 'think', 'so', 'Will', 'be', 'favorite', 'movie', 'ever', 'Probably', 'not', 'not', 'film', 'see', 'be', 'favorite']",N/A

618094,AK0CENM3LUM28,B00005JMFH,Amazon Customer,"[0, 1]","Brother Bear / B00005JMFH*Spoilers*It has been a theory of mine for quite some time that Disney's overall decline can be traced in a large part to their slow abandonment of the 'musical' format of the older classics. It can hardly be a coincidence that all the members of our household, regardless of age or gender, will often find themselves humming such songs as ""Be Our Guest"" and ""Whole New World"", and yet most of us had completely forgotten the enjoyable ""Brother Bear"" a few days after watching.Not that there's anything wrong with ""Brother Bear"". It's a slightly (but forgivably) cookie-cutter movie where a young man comes of age, learns to appreciate other races/species/cultures, and comes to embrace responsibility that deserves, if nothing else, kudos for treating a non-western European culture with sensitivity and respect. Yet I can't help but wonder why Disney bothers with a soundtrack at all if it's going to be as half-hearted as this one is. Phil Collins is here, of course, because it has apparently become mandatory to include him in all Disney movies, but his music here is generic and bland - nowhere near as compelling as his music was inTarzan. The songs are so generic that I can't honestly be certain whether they were made specially for this movie or not - the cheery ""I'm on my way"" beat and lyrics seem equally suited for pretty much every other 'journey' movie ever created. They could have easily thrown in the angsty 'growing up' song fromTreasure Planetand I probably wouldn't have noticed the repeat. Oddly, Tina Turner was tapped to belt out the main theme, and her powerfully gritty voice just seems out of place here. The line ""Truly brothers all the same,"" in particularly stuck with me, less because of the emotion behind it and more because the shrieking made my ears throb. Oh well.The plot itself is, as mentioned before, pretty basic. A difficult journey brings together two strangers in a lifetime bond - I'm pretty sure one or two other movies have tapped that plot line at some point. Still, the children of the family will get some nice enjoyment out of it, and it's nice to see a movie that treats non-western cultures with a modicum of respect, particularly without going so overboard that you just trade in ugly stereotypes with 'flattering' ones which are no less healthy. Instead, the people in ""Brother Bear"" are realistic, and I appreciate that.It's nice, I guess, to see Disney reaching out to the rest of us by moving beyond the 'pretty princess' plot lines and providing a little variety (although it would be nice to have a non-pretty princess plot that still starred a girl... can we have that, please, Disney?), but I still think that moving away from the musical aspect is a mistake. And, really, if you're going to stamp Phil Collins on everything, at least make the songs relevant enough to the movie that they don't sound like generic bland pap pulled off the radio.

This film stands alone from its Disney predecessors, and postures itself with great nobility. The lesson of the film is beautifully articulated, and the fusion of music and animation is done with seamless precision.To stand in ones shoes as a means of developing an understanding of our differences and likenesses is both profound and moving. As creatures who live and abide in the same dwelling space, it stands to reason that we would not need to do as Kenai. However, the lesson is one of beauty and virtue. I do hope that more people view this film. In doing so, I hope that people are able to see the lesson within the film, the beauty of artistry and develope a more thorough understanding that our differences in culture, beliefs and stature is what makes the world so beautiful.

And I wacthed it expectantly, then I found it was so good as my anticipation, and just like my friends said, it was touching!I can't say which plot has impressed me most, because many plots were so unforgettable. I can still remember every tableau of the plot of the song ""Welcome"". Bears fished and played together, there was warmth and love everywhere, the salmon run was filled with family atmosphere! When I saw a mother bear played with her cub, suddenly, I associated them with Koda, who has been without his mother, I tried very hard to stop my tears. The plot of the song ""On My Way"" was very impressed. We could see lonely little Koda was so strong and confident! The plot of the song ""No Way Out"" was so sentimental. Kenai's sorry and sad face, Koda's helpless expression and sorrowful tears, and the falling winter snow, made my tears flood. By the end of the movie, the 3 brothers, the orphan bear and the spirit of his mother, all united. ""He needs me."" When Kenai required to become a bear for lonely Koda, I could feel the strong bond between these 2 brothers from 2 different worlds. But just love exists, brothers are all the same, even if they came from 2 absolute different worlds! Well, I found this story was a little similar to the story of ""Tarzan"".Besides, if this movie has been without so glorious music, it won't be so touching. ""Great Spirits"" ""On My Way"" ""Welcome"" and ""No Way Out"" were perfect songs, and they were very fit for all the plots where they came up. I attributed the success of this movie to its wonderful music composing.This is really a touching movie. And every Disney fan won't miss this, I bet everyone will be moved by it.

618105,AMICVV9N2U2R4,B00005JMFH,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[0, 1]","Brother Bear has the delightful setting of the Alaskan wilderness, where animals and connection with nature are a part of everyday life. It's a gorgeously realized, inspiring 2D film from Disney with great characters and visuals.In his indigenous tribe in Alaska, Kenai is about to take his coming-of-age ceremony, which involves the very important part of receiving a token for his spirit animal (dictated to the tribe by their wisewoman). Kenai's token happens to be a bear, which is a problem seeing how he despises bears, believing them to be nothing but mindless monsters. It doesn't help when his older, wise brother Sitka sacrifices himself to save Kenai and his brother  Denahi from a bear (that Kenai provoked, incidentally). Filled with even more resentment for his token, Kenai kills the bear - but his brother Sitka, now a spirit, punishes Kenai for this act by turning him into a bear. The only way Kenai can become human again is if he goes to the mountain where the spirits touch the earth. Of course, to do this he has to not only contend with being in the form of an animal he hates, but also wit the extremely talkative company of bear cub Koda. And if that weren't enough, Denahi pursuis Kenai, believing him to be the bear who killed his only remaining brother.That's the plot in a nutshell; it's a very authentic, exciting plot with deep themes of connection to nature, understanding above ignorance (i.e. foot on the other shoe) and forgiveness. Kenai and Koda bounce off each other very well, as do the bumbling moose brothers Tuke and Rutt, whom Kenai seems to run into over and over again. They are hilarious, endearing characters that the film would be much lesser without.Visually, Brother Bear is a triumph as well. The character designs for the humans are a bit Lilo & Stitch inspired, but the animal designs are all top-notch. Same goes for the masterclass standard character animation, breathing all of the aforementioned to life and then some. The special effects for the spirits are mesmerizing, and there is a subtle change in richness of colour when Kenai goes from human to bear (curiously, this also seems to apply to the screen area itself - on my DVD copy, at least, the screen is full wide-screen when Kenai becomes a bear, not when he's human. Deliberate artistic choice or a happy accident in transfer? Who knows.)The only dud I can give Brother Bear is its soundtrack. Don't get me wrong, much of the music is great, in particular during the spirit scenes. The songs, however, miss the mark completely. They sound way too Americanized to really speak of what this film is trying to say. The opening number is some sort of gospel number, which is completely at odds with what's going on. Phil Collins's melodies (which I never liked in Tarzan either) sound too standard and out of step with the movie's atmosphere. Particularly during the salmon run scene does the music sound downright cliche and trite, which is a real shame.But as much as Brother Bear fails musically, it succeeds in terms of story, character and beauty. Wholly recommended film, just be ready to endure a little Phil Collins as part of the package.",4,"Inspiring, Just Cursed with Poor Soundtrack",1338163200,"05 28, 2012",2012,3161,"['Brother', 'Bear', 'delightful', 'setting', 'Alaskan', 'wilderness', 'where', 'animals', 'connection', 'nature', 'are', 'part', 'everyday', 'life', 'gorgeously', 'realized', 'inspiring', '2D', 'film', 'Disney', 'great', 'characters', 'visuals.In', 'indigenous', 'tribe', 'Alaska', 'Kenai', 'take', 'coming-of-age', 'ceremony', 'very', 'important', 'part', 'receiving', 'token', 'spirit', 'animal', 'dictated', 'tribe', 'wisewoman', 'Kenai', 'token', 'be', 'bear', 'problem', 'seeing', 'how', 'bears', 'believing', 'be', 'nothing', 'mindless', 'monsters', ""n't"", 'help', 'when', 'older', 'wise', 'brother', 'Sitka', 'save', 'Kenai', 'brother', 'Denahi', 'bear', 'Kenai', 'provoked', 'incidentally', 'Filled', 'even', 'more', 'resentment', 'token', 'Kenai', 'bear', 'brother', 'Sitka', 'now', 'spirit', 'punishes', 'Kenai', 'act', 'turning', 'bear', 'only', 'way', 'Kenai', 'can', 'become', 'human', 'again', 'mountain', 'where', 'spirits', 'touch', 'earth', 'course', 'do', 'not', 'only', 'contend', 'being', 'form', 'animal', 'also', 'wit', 'extremely', 'talkative', 'company', 'bear', 'cub', 'Koda', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Denahi', 'pursuis', 'Kenai', 'believing', 'be', 'bear', 'who', 'killed', 'only', 'remaining', 'brother.That', 'plot', 'nutshell', 'very', 'authentic', 'exciting', 'plot', 'deep', 'themes', 'connection', 'nature', 'understanding', 'ignorance', 'i.e', 'foot', 'other', 'shoe', 'forgiveness', 'Kenai', 'Koda', 'bounce', 'off', 'other', 'very', 'well', 'do', 'bumbling', 'moose', 'brothers', 'Tuke', 'Rutt', 'whom', 'Kenai', 'run', 'over', 'again', 'are', 'hilarious', 'endearing', 'characters', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'lesser', 'without.Visually', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'triumph', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'designs', 'humans', 'are', 'bit', 'Lilo', 'Stitch', 'inspired', 'animal', 'designs', 'are', 'top-notch', 'Same', 'masterclass', 'standard', 'character', 'animation', 'breathing', 'aforementioned', 'life', 'then', 'special', 'effects', 'spirits', 'are', 'mesmerizing', 'subtle', 'change', 'richness', 'colour', 'when', 'Kenai', 'human', 'bear', 'curiously', 'also', 'apply', 'screen', 'area', 'DVD', 'copy', 'least', 'screen', 'full', 'wide-screen', 'when', 'Kenai', 'bear', 'not', 'when', 'human', 'Deliberate', 'artistic', 'choice', 'happy', 'accident', 'transfer', 'Who', 'only', 'dud', 'can', 'give', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'soundtrack', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'much', 'music', 'great', 'particular', 'spirit', 'scenes', 'songs', 'however', 'miss', 'mark', 'completely', 'sound', 'way', 'too', 'Americanized', 'really', 'speak', 'what', 'film', 'trying', 'say', 'opening', 'number', 'sort', 'gospel', 'number', 'completely', 'odds', 'what', 'going', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'melodies', 'never', 'liked', 'Tarzan', 'sound', 'too', 'standard', 'step', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'Particularly', 'salmon', 'run', 'scene', 'music', 'sound', 'downright', 'cliche', 'trite', 'real', 'shame.But', 'as', 'much', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'musically', 'terms', 'story', 'character', 'beauty', 'Wholly', 'recommended', 'film', 'just', 'be', 'ready', 'endure', 'little', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'part', 'package']",N/A

When his brother's spirit sees what he's doing, he changes Kenai into a Bear to make him see through the animals point-of-view.AMAZING! I was really impressed at how well done this movie is. I have to admit that this is one of my favorite animated films to date. The music by Phil Collins and (surprise!) Tina Turner are great! The score really stands out too, especially during the exciting transformation scene. Though, not as much music as my second favorite animated film, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, this one still delivers and music placement is put in where music is needed. The story is a bit strong and there are some scary scenes that may frighten little children, but other than that, the kids will forget about it when the two hilarious Moose, Rutt and Tuke, arrive on-screen (voiced wonderfully by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas). The Animation mixed in with a few CGI's are fantastic! as is the detail and the usage of the widescreen scope is used to the fullest extent. I was reading around and one reviewer said that this is a collaboration of all of the Disney themes, such as family in 'The Lion King', the transformation of 'The Little Mermaid', the Natives in 'Pocahontas' and the collaboration of Phil Collins again, just like in 'Tarzan'. I do agree with this and found it incredibly interesting that there are similarities which I welcome to with open arms.I have to comment on how animated films have more adult themes to them these days. The 3 Nominated films of 2003 have elements of death or separation to them. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, it's actually, to me, a breath of fresh air. Brother Bear does have some intense and scary moments but at the same time there are are those fluffy scenes that back it up. I grew up watching Disney films right when I was at least 7 years old and ten years later, I have to admit, I still watch them. That may seem a bit sad and embarrasing, on my part, but it just shows how Animated films, such as Brother Bear, have that long range of age where no matter how old you are, you can still learn and relate to what these stories have to tell. It's really a dissapointment to hear that Traditional Animation is fading away, as it really shows the talent of human art, but times are changing and so is technology. So, just as long as Animated films have a great story to tell then I'm open to the posibilities that Computer Animation has to offer.So, in the end, Brother Bear is an excellent mix of Disney themes that is filled with great music, good story and overall just a great film.",5,An Amazing Bear,1090108800,"07 18, 2004",2004,2925,"['saw', 'trailers', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'when', 'was', 'theatres', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'much', 'got', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Nomination', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Feature', 'then', 'said', 'myself', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'guess', 'what', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'Kenai', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'young', 'Native', 'boy', 'who', 'revenge', 'bear', 'who', 'killed', 'older', 'brother', 'When', 'brother', 'spirit', 'what', 'doing', 'Kenai', 'Bear', 'make', 'see', 'animals', 'point-of-view.AMAZING', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'how', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'have', 'admit', 'one', 'favorite', 'animated', 'films', 'date', 'music', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'surprise', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'are', 'great', 'score', 'really', 'out', 'too', 'especially', 'exciting', 'transformation', 'scene', 'Though', 'not', 'much', 'music', 'second', 'favorite', 'animated', 'film', 'Spirit', 'Stallion', 'Cimarron', 'one', 'still', 'delivers', 'music', 'placement', 'put', 'where', 'music', 'needed', 'story', 'bit', 'strong', 'are', 'scary', 'scenes', 'may', 'frighten', 'little', 'children', 'other', 'kids', 'will', 'forget', 'when', 'two', 'hilarious', 'Moose', 'Rutt', 'Tuke', 'arrive', 'on-screen', 'voiced', 'wonderfully', 'Rick', 'Moranis', 'Dave', 'Thomas', 'Animation', 'mixed', 'few', 'CGI', 'are', 'fantastic', 'detail', 'usage', 'widescreen', 'scope', 'used', 'fullest', 'extent', 'was', 'reading', 'around', 'one', 'reviewer', 'said', 'collaboration', 'Disney', 'themes', 'such', 'family', ""'The"", 'Lion', 'King', 'transformation', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Natives', ""'Pocahontas"", 'collaboration', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'again', 'just', ""'Tarzan"", 'do', 'agree', 'found', 'incredibly', 'interesting', 'are', 'similarities', 'welcome', 'open', 'arms.I', 'have', 'comment', 'how', 'animated', 'films', 'have', 'more', 'adult', 'themes', 'days', '3', 'Nominated', 'films', '2003', 'have', 'elements', 'death', 'separation', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'bad', 'thing', 'actually', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'Bear', 'have', 'intense', 'scary', 'moments', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'are', 'fluffy', 'scenes', 'back', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Disney', 'films', 'right', 'when', 'was', 'least', '7', 'years', 'old', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'have', 'admit', 'still', 'watch', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'sad', 'embarrasing', 'part', 'just', 'how', 'Animated', 'films', 'such', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'have', 'that', 'long', 'range', 'age', 'where', 'matter', 'how', 'old', 'are', 'can', 'still', 'learn', 'relate', 'what', 'stories', 'have', 'tell', 'really', 'dissapointment', 'hear', 'Traditional', 'Animation', 'fading', 'away', 'really', 'talent', 'human', 'art', 'times', 'are', 'changing', 'so', 'technology', 'So', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'Animated', 'films', 'have', 'great', 'story', 'tell', 'then', ""'m"", 'open', 'posibilities', 'Computer', 'Animation', 'offer.So', 'end', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'excellent', 'mix', 'Disney', 'themes', 'filled', 'great', 'music', 'good', 'story', 'overall', 'just', 'great', 'film']",N/A

618119,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JMFH,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 2]","At one point badmouthing Disney didn't seem likely, especially in the early 90's. In the late 90's, the films weren't as timeless but they were still enjoyable with some of their best animation in years (Tarzan's in particular). But then stuff like Atlantis and Treasure Planet hit and the once unknockable studio got a huge face plant, with both not doing as well in the box office as they should've. Brother Bear is one of those films that didn't get as much attention, mainly because it probably wasn't going to do well anyway. While it's certainly not even remotely close to even marginally entertaining films like Oliver and Company, it's still something that just doesn't hit home in anything.Kenai is an Inuit who's quite brash and immature. When one of his brothers, Sitka, is accidentally killed while fighting a bear, Kenai swears revenge. But upon killing the bear, spirits turn Kenai into a bear himself. Add insult to injury, his other brother Denahi can't hear Kenai talk (since it's just bear growls) and Denahi believes the bear killed Kenai. So Kenai must find a way, along with young cub Koda, to restore himself back to normal while avoiding his brother who's unaware his brother Kenai's a bear.The animation is one of Disney's more underrated aspects, especially with all of the 3D films coming out lately. While this is nowhere near the House's best, there's some backgrounds and character animation that look fantastic, with a full color palette and detail. Problem is the visuals almost fade after you've seen it. Yeah you loved what you saw but you can't remember where you saw it or what in particular you loved. Also on disc 2 we find the original aspect ratio. The film was first shown in theatres in a 1:66:1 format then at a certain point it switched to a widescreen 2:55:1. While it's a different idea, it just feels irritating, especially when you re-watch the film.How's the story? Very thin and kind of lifeless. It just feels too by-the-numbers and seen it before but it's not a kind of familiarity that feels good because it works but rather it's just the same ol'. It's like going to one of those tiny diners with the one double-sided menu: sure the food's good but after awhile you just run out of new things to try. Then we have the banal Phil Collins song, which worked in Tarzan, but here they just feel like ""ugh, this guy"". Then we have the moose duo, played by Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis. Unlike Timon and Pumbaa, who were funny but felt part of the story, these feel like they were put in to make with the funny jokes for no reason. You can take them out and you wouldn't miss them all that much, not to mention the ""eh?"" schtick got unbelievably old fast.I wouldn't say it's a bad animated film, I mean it's entertaining to a point, great to look at and it's very kid-friendly.

Lately, the craftspeople at Pixar have produced the best all-ages films.  Brother Bear is a fine enough film for the 9 to 11 age group, but the story line makes it a difficult film for younger children to handle, and the inconsistencies of mood show through as flaws for older, more critical members of the audience.Brother Bear contains a curious mixture of scenes of traditional lovable Disney animal characters singing together and getting along famously, and then other scenes of battles to the death.  The deaths in the film, which are all preceded by fairly lengthy, loud and somewhat graphic battle scenes, are what make the film challenging for the young set.  My 7 year-old had to close her eyes and hold her hands over her ears, and get a few reassuring pats from me, in order to make it through those scenes.  Without giving away the plot, I will warn that a good number of characters die, and there is a revelation at the end of the film (about who did what to whom) that can be heartbreaking.  All this is much more overwhelming than the death of Bambi's mother ever was.That said, the storyline is a fairly interesting one (for those who are able to handle it), and the film does convey a positive message about how man should interact with nature, as represented by the bears.  Thankfully, the film is not completely idealistic, since it does recognize the necessity of the food chain, as illustrated by the long scene of the bears happily munching away on a salmon run.  The representation of Native American spiritual beliefs is no doubt less than perfect, but anyone who looks to a Disney animated film for 100% historical accuracy is looking in the wrong place.The animation is fine, but nothing spectacular.  Phil Collins provided a few good upbeat songs, but they accounted for several of the severe shifts in mood, as the film swung back and forth between battle scenes to joyful celebrations of life.  The McKenzie brothers from Canada, appropriately cast as moose, provide the comic relief, but I don't think they'll be getting their own TV show on the Disney channel, as did Timon and Pumbaa from the Lion King.",3,"Good for certain ages, but Disney has done better",1073520000,"01 8, 2004",2004,2331,"['absolute', 'best', 'Disney', 'films', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'feature', 'story', 'line', 'music', 'characters', 'magical', 'animation', 'effects', 'are', 'fully', 'enjoyable', 'ages', 'youngest', 'eldest', 'Lately', 'craftspeople', 'Pixar', 'have', 'produced', 'best', 'all-ages', 'films', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'fine', 'enough', 'film', '9', '11', 'age', 'group', 'story', 'line', 'difficult', 'film', 'younger', 'children', 'handle', 'inconsistencies', 'mood', 'show', 'flaws', 'older', 'more', 'critical', 'members', 'audience.Brother', 'Bear', 'curious', 'mixture', 'scenes', 'traditional', 'lovable', 'Disney', 'animal', 'characters', 'singing', 'together', 'getting', 'along', 'famously', 'then', 'other', 'scenes', 'battles', 'death', 'deaths', 'film', 'are', 'preceded', 'fairly', 'lengthy', 'loud', 'somewhat', 'graphic', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'make', 'film', 'challenging', 'young', 'set', '7', 'year-old', 'had', 'close', 'eyes', 'hold', 'hands', 'ears', 'get', 'few', 'reassuring', 'pats', 'order', 'make', 'scenes', 'giving', 'away', 'plot', 'will', 'warn', 'good', 'number', 'characters', 'die', 'revelation', 'end', 'film', 'who', 'did', 'what', 'whom', 'can', 'be', 'heartbreaking', 'much', 'more', 'overwhelming', 'death', 'Bambi', 'mother', 'ever', 'was.That', 'said', 'storyline', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'one', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'handle', 'film', 'convey', 'positive', 'message', 'how', 'man', 'should', 'interact', 'nature', 'represented', 'bears', 'Thankfully', 'film', 'not', 'completely', 'idealistic', 'recognize', 'necessity', 'food', 'chain', 'illustrated', 'long', 'scene', 'bears', 'happily', 'munching', 'away', 'salmon', 'run', 'representation', 'Native', 'American', 'spiritual', 'beliefs', 'doubt', 'less', 'perfect', 'anyone', 'who', 'Disney', 'animated', 'film', '100', '%', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'looking', 'wrong', 'place.The', 'animation', 'fine', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'provided', 'few', 'good', 'upbeat', 'songs', 'accounted', 'several', 'severe', 'shifts', 'mood', 'film', 'swung', 'back', 'forth', 'battle', 'scenes', 'joyful', 'celebrations', 'life', 'McKenzie', 'brothers', 'Canada', 'appropriately', 'cast', 'moose', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'getting', 'own', 'TV', 'show', 'Disney', 'channel', 'did', 'Timon', 'Pumbaa', 'Lion', 'King']",N/A

The complaints about the animation, the weak story, the slow plot, the music, the nature-prechiness, etc., make me really wonder about some people. Personally, I got this film after not having gone to the theater to see it, and was very surprised at its quality.Being a Disney fan from way back, I know good animation when I see it, and the animation in this film was flawless. the use of CGI was perfect in the moments when used, and wasn't too outrageously obvious. True, the story seems to drag at times, but not as bad as all that. I found the Phil Collins soundtrack to be very well done, if not as good as his work on Tarzan. In particular, I loved hearing Tina Turner sing Great Spirits. As for nature loving, shouldn't we all care more about the environment? The point to the native people was to live in harmony with nature.

618133,AJPIV68PR3KZ7,B00005JMFH,E. Cullmann,"[0, 0]","In the Disney-animated adventure Brother Bear, Joaquin Phoenix provides the voice of Kenai, a young Native American boy whose brother, Sitka (voice of D.B. Sweeney), is killed by a mother bear protecting her cubs. With revenge in mind, Kenai sets out into the woods only to find himself magically transformed into a bear himself. Seeing the world through the eyes of his prey, Kenai is forced to learn a lesson about nature and life. On a comic footnote: Brother Bear also features the voices of Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas as Rutt and Tuke, moose characters reminiscent of their beer-guzzling McKenzie brothers from SCTV and Strange Brew; because this is a family-oriented cartoon - and it would be inappropriate for the moose to quaff beer -- the two moose express a fondness for eating wheat hops instead. The film is set in a post-ice age North America, where the local tribesmen believe all creatures are created through the Spirits, who are said to appear in the form of an aurora. Three brothers, Kenai (voiced by Joaquin Phoenix), Denahi (voiced by Jason Raize) and Sitka (voiced by D.B. Sweeney), return to their tribe in order for Kenai to receive his sacred totem, its meaning being what he must achieve to call himself a man. Unlike Sitka, who gained the eagle of guidance, and Denahi who gained the wolf of wisdom, Kenai receives the bear of love, much to his objections, stating that bears are thieves. His point is made a fact when a bear steals some salmon. Kenai and his brothers pursue the bear, but a fight follows on a glacier, Sitka giving his life to save his brothers, although the bear survives. Vengeful, Kenai heads out to avenge Sitka. He chases the bear up onto a mountain and kills it. The Spirits, represented by Sitka's spirit in the form of a bald eagle transforms Kenai into a bear after the dead bear's body disappears. Denahi arrives, mistaking Kenai for dead, and his bear form is responsible for it, vows to avenge Kenai.Kenai falls down some river rapids, survives, and is healed by Tanana (voiced by Joan Copeland), the shaman of Kenai's tribe. She does not speak the bear language, but advises him to return to the mountain to find Sitka and be turned back to normal, but only when he corrects what he had done; she quickly disappears without an explanation. Kenai quickly discovers the wildlife can talk, meeting two brother mooses, Rutt and Tuke (voiced by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas). He gets caught in a trap, but is freed by a chatty bear cub named Koda (voiced by Jeremy Suarez). The two bears make a deal, Kenai will go with Koda to a nearby salmon run and then the cub will lead Kenai to the mountain. As the two eventually form a sibling-like bond, Koda revealing his mother is missing. The two are hunted by Denahi who fails multiple times to kill Kenai, still unaware that he is his brother. Rutt and Tuke run into the bears multiple times, the group hitching a ride on a herd of mammoths to quicken the pace to the salmon run, but the moose are left behind when the bears move on. Kenai and Koda escape Denahi again, and reach the salmon run, where a large number of bears live as a family, including the leader Tug (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan), a Grizzly Bear. Kenai becomes very much at home and at content with the other bears. During a discussion among the bears, Koda tells a story about his mother fighting human hunters, making Kenai realize he killed Koda's mother.Kenai's contentment is about to be shattered when Koda tells the story of his separation from his motherGuilty and horrified, Kenai runs away but Koda soon finds him. Kenai reveals the truth to Koda, who runs away grief-stricken. An apologetic Kenai leaves to reach the mountain. Rutt and Took, having fallen out, reform their brotherhood in front of Koda, prompting him to go after Kenai. Denahi confronts Kenai on the mountain, but their fight is intervened by Koda who steals Denahi's hunting pike. Kenai goes to Koda's aid out of love, prompting Sitka to appear and turn him back into a human, much to Denahi and Koda's surprise. However, Kenai asks Sitka to transform him back into a bear so he can stay with Koda. Sitka complies, and Koda is reunited briefly with the spirit of his mother, before she and Sitka return to the Spirits. In the end, Kenai lives with the rest of the bears and gains his title as a man, through being a bear.How brother bear relates to world religion in how the local tribesmen believe all creatures are created through the Spirits, who are said to appear in the form of an aurora.",4,Brother Bear Review,1327708800,"01 28, 2012",2012,4548,"['Disney-animated', 'adventure', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'voice', 'Kenai', 'young', 'Native', 'American', 'boy', 'brother', 'Sitka', 'voice', 'D.B', 'Sweeney', 'killed', 'mother', 'bear', 'protecting', 'cubs', 'revenge', 'mind', 'Kenai', 'out', 'woods', 'only', 'find', 'magically', 'transformed', 'bear', 'Seeing', 'world', 'eyes', 'prey', 'Kenai', 'forced', 'learn', 'lesson', 'nature', 'life', 'comic', 'footnote', 'Bear', 'also', 'voices', 'Rick', 'Moranis', 'Dave', 'Thomas', 'Rutt', 'Tuke', 'moose', 'characters', 'reminiscent', 'beer-guzzling', 'McKenzie', 'brothers', 'SCTV', 'Strange', 'Brew', 'family-oriented', 'cartoon', 'would', 'be', 'inappropriate', 'moose', 'quaff', 'beer', 'two', 'moose', 'fondness', 'eating', 'wheat', 'hops', 'instead', 'film', 'set', 'post-ice', 'age', 'North', 'America', 'where', 'local', 'tribesmen', 'believe', 'creatures', 'are', 'created', 'Spirits', 'who', 'are', 'said', 'appear', 'form', 'aurora', 'Three', 'brothers', 'Kenai', 'voiced', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Denahi', 'voiced', 'Jason', 'Raize', 'Sitka', 'voiced', 'D.B', 'Sweeney', 'return', 'tribe', 'order', 'Kenai', 'receive', 'sacred', 'totem', 'meaning', 'being', 'what', 'must', 'achieve', 'call', 'man', 'Sitka', 'who', 'gained', 'eagle', 'guidance', 'Denahi', 'who', 'gained', 'wolf', 'wisdom', 'Kenai', 'bear', 'love', 'much', 'objections', 'stating', 'bears', 'are', 'thieves', 'point', 'made', 'fact', 'when', 'bear', 'salmon', 'Kenai', 'brothers', 'pursue', 'bear', 'fight', 'glacier', 'Sitka', 'giving', 'life', 'save', 'brothers', 'bear', 'survives', 'Vengeful', 'Kenai', 'out', 'avenge', 'Sitka', 'bear', 'up', 'mountain', 'Spirits', 'represented', 'Sitka', 'spirit', 'form', 'bald', 'eagle', 'transforms', 'Kenai', 'bear', 'dead', 'bear', 'body', 'Denahi', 'mistaking', 'Kenai', 'dead', 'bear', 'form', 'responsible', 'avenge', 'Kenai.Kenai', 'down', 'river', 'rapids', 'survives', 'healed', 'Tanana', 'voiced', 'Joan', 'Copeland', 'shaman', 'Kenai', 'tribe', 'not', 'speak', 'bear', 'language', 'return', 'mountain', 'find', 'Sitka', 'be', 'turned', 'back', 'normal', 'only', 'when', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'quickly', 'explanation', 'Kenai', 'quickly', 'wildlife', 'can', 'talk', 'meeting', 'two', 'brother', 'mooses', 'Rutt', 'Tuke', 'voiced', 'Rick', 'Moranis', 'Dave', 'Thomas', 'caught', 'trap', 'freed', 'chatty', 'bear', 'cub', 'named', 'Koda', 'voiced', 'Jeremy', 'Suarez', 'two', 'bears', 'make', 'deal', 'Kenai', 'will', 'go', 'Koda', 'nearby', 'salmon', 'run', 'then', 'cub', 'will', 'lead', 'Kenai', 'mountain', 'two', 'eventually', 'form', 'sibling-like', 'bond', 'Koda', 'revealing', 'mother', 'missing', 'two', 'are', 'hunted', 'Denahi', 'who', 'multiple', 'times', 'kill', 'Kenai', 'still', 'unaware', 'brother', 'Rutt', 'Tuke', 'run', 'bears', 'multiple', 'times', 'group', 'hitching', 'ride', 'herd', 'mammoths', 'quicken', 'pace', 'salmon', 'run', 'moose', 'are', 'left', 'when', 'bears', 'move', 'Kenai', 'Koda', 'escape', 'Denahi', 'again', 'reach', 'salmon', 'run', 'where', 'large', 'number', 'bears', 'live', 'family', 'including', 'leader', 'Tug', 'voiced', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'Grizzly', 'Bear', 'Kenai', 'very', 'much', 'home', 'content', 'other', 'bears', 'discussion', 'bears', 'Koda', 'story', 'mother', 'fighting', 'human', 'hunters', 'making', 'Kenai', 'realize', 'killed', 'Koda', 'mother.Kenai', 'contentment', 'be', 'shattered', 'when', 'Koda', 'story', 'separation', 'motherGuilty', 'horrified', 'Kenai', 'away', 'Koda', 'soon', 'Kenai', 'truth', 'Koda', 'who', 'away', 'grief-stricken', 'apologetic', 'Kenai', 'reach', 'mountain', 'Rutt', 'Took', 'having', 'fallen', 'out', 'reform', 'brotherhood', 'front', 'Koda', 'prompting', 'go', 'Kenai', 'Denahi', 'confronts', 'Kenai', 'mountain', 'fight', 'intervened', 'Koda', 'who', 'Denahi', 'hunting', 'pike', 'Kenai', 'Koda', 'aid', 'love', 'prompting', 'Sitka', 'appear', 'turn', 'back', 'human', 'much', 'Denahi', 'Koda', 'surprise', 'However', 'Kenai', 'Sitka', 'transform', 'back', 'bear', 'can', 'stay', 'Koda', 'Sitka', 'complies', 'Koda', 'reunited', 'briefly', 'spirit', 'mother', 'Sitka', 'return', 'Spirits', 'end', 'Kenai', 'rest', 'bears', 'gains', 'title', 'man', 'being', 'bear.How', 'brother', 'bear', 'world', 'religion', 'how', 'local', 'tribesmen', 'believe', 'creatures', 'are', 'created', 'Spirits', 'who', 'are', 'said', 'appear', 'form', 'aurora']",N/A

David Swan,"[1, 2]","Writing a story about Native American's when you're not Native American and your audience is mostly non-Native American can be a dicey prospect. In the olden days ""Indians"" were the de facto horse riding, war paint wearing villains standing in the way of white people's ""manifest destiny"". A more enlightened culture consciously decided to treat Native American's with more reverence particularly given the raw deal they been dealt since European's appeared on the shores of the new world. The problem was that now Native American's became even blander. Are the Native American's in ""Brother Bear"" one with nature? You bet. Do they have an old wise woman/man? Naturally. Do they commune with the ancient spirits? Of course. The story takes place in what would become Canada at least 10,000 BC (since Woolly Mammoths are still alive). A Native American youth named Kenai witnesses the death of his eldest brother and blames his death on a bear who unbeknownst to him was protecting her cub. Kenai seeks revenge and kills the bear only to have HIMSELF turned into a bear by the spirits. The middle brother, Denahi, sees Kenai's empty clothing and apparently assumes the bear ate him completely and now seeks revenge on the bear (Kenai). It's not a bad story it's just executed in such a paint by numbers manner.This is definitely not my favorite Disney animated feature. It feels like a film made by another studio trying to emulate Disney. Besides being uninspired it seems unsure about what kind of film it wants to be. The first part of the movie is relatively serious but once Kanai turns into a bear the film takes an abrupt turn becoming a silly animal film. Kanai is able to understand all the animals and they all talk like modern day American's. Two moose are voiced by Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis doing their McKenzie Brothers from Strange Brew (an idea that sounds a lot funnier on paper). The squirrels and bunnies are all adorable and Kanai comes across a sassy little bear cub Koda. His ""wisecracking"" attitude wore thin almost immediately. The animators even intentionally created a contrast between Kenai the human and Kenai the bear by changing the brightness, art style (more cartoony as the bear) and even the aspect ratio of the film. The contrast of cutesy squirrels with nuts in their mouths and Denahi's quest to kill Kanai is jarring and weird.The poster for Brother Bear has the humorous tagline ""Nature Calls"" with Kenai looking down lovingly at Koda. This is a complete mischaracterization of the movie but the movie did far better at the box office than the two Disney movies that book ended it including the disasters Treasure Planet and Home on the Range. I can't fault the marketers since they managed to sell a bland movie with terrible music and have it make money. This is not a movie I would add to my collection. The animation is well done if they could have ditched the cutesy parts. I guess they couldn't toss out Koda since he's integral to the story but couldn't that have used another voice actor. Awful. The ending of the film was an, ""are you serious?"" kind of ending. For a film trying to focus on spirituality it just seems to have no soul of its own.",3,Brother Bore,1321833600,"11 21, 2011",2011,3195,"['Writing', 'story', 'Native', 'American', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'Native', 'American', 'audience', 'mostly', 'non-Native', 'American', 'can', 'be', 'dicey', 'prospect', 'olden', 'days', 'Indians', 'were', 'de', 'facto', 'horse', 'riding', 'war', 'paint', 'wearing', 'villains', 'standing', 'way', 'white', 'people', 'manifest', 'destiny', 'more', 'enlightened', 'culture', 'consciously', 'decided', 'treat', 'Native', 'American', 'more', 'reverence', 'particularly', 'given', 'raw', 'deal', 'been', 'dealt', 'European', 'appeared', 'shores', 'new', 'world', 'problem', 'was', 'now', 'Native', 'American', 'became', 'even', 'blander', 'Are', 'Native', 'American', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'one', 'nature', 'bet', 'Do', 'have', 'old', 'wise', 'woman/man', 'Naturally', 'Do', 'commune', 'ancient', 'spirits', 'course', 'story', 'place', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'Canada', 'least', '10,000', 'BC', 'Woolly', 'Mammoths', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'Native', 'American', 'youth', 'named', 'Kenai', 'death', 'eldest', 'brother', 'death', 'bear', 'who', 'unbeknownst', 'was', 'protecting', 'cub', 'Kenai', 'revenge', 'bear', 'only', 'have', 'HIMSELF', 'turned', 'bear', 'spirits', 'middle', 'brother', 'Denahi', 'Kenai', 'empty', 'clothing', 'apparently', 'bear', 'ate', 'completely', 'now', 'revenge', 'bear', 'Kenai', 'not', 'bad', 'story', 'just', 'executed', 'such', 'paint', 'numbers', 'manner.This', 'definitely', 'not', 'favorite', 'Disney', 'animated', 'feature', 'film', 'made', 'studio', 'trying', 'emulate', 'Disney', 'being', 'uninspired', 'unsure', 'what', 'kind', 'film', 'be', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'relatively', 'serious', 'once', 'Kanai', 'bear', 'film', 'abrupt', 'turn', 'becoming', 'silly', 'animal', 'film', 'Kanai', 'able', 'understand', 'animals', 'talk', 'modern', 'day', 'American', 'Two', 'moose', 'are', 'voiced', 'Dave', 'Thomas', 'Rick', 'Moranis', 'doing', 'McKenzie', 'Brothers', 'Strange', 'Brew', 'idea', 'lot', 'funnier', 'paper', 'squirrels', 'bunnies', 'are', 'adorable', 'Kanai', 'sassy', 'little', 'bear', 'cub', 'Koda', 'wisecracking', 'attitude', 'wore', 'thin', 'almost', 'immediately', 'animators', 'even', 'intentionally', 'created', 'contrast', 'Kenai', 'human', 'Kenai', 'bear', 'changing', 'brightness', 'art', 'style', 'more', 'cartoony', 'bear', 'even', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'film', 'contrast', 'cutesy', 'squirrels', 'nuts', 'mouths', 'Denahi', 'quest', 'kill', 'Kanai', 'jarring', 'weird.The', 'poster', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'humorous', 'tagline', 'Nature', 'Calls', 'Kenai', 'looking', 'down', 'lovingly', 'Koda', 'complete', 'mischaracterization', 'movie', 'movie', 'did', 'far', 'better', 'box', 'office', 'two', 'Disney', 'movies', 'book', 'ended', 'including', 'disasters', 'Treasure', 'Planet', 'Home', 'Range', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'marketers', 'managed', 'sell', 'bland', 'movie', 'terrible', 'music', 'have', 'make', 'money', 'not', 'movie', 'would', 'add', 'collection', 'animation', 'well', 'done', 'could', 'have', 'ditched', 'cutesy', 'parts', 'guess', 'could', ""n't"", 'toss', 'out', 'Koda', 'integral', 'story', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'used', 'voice', 'actor', 'Awful', 'ending', 'film', 'was', 'are', 'serious', 'kind', 'ending', 'film', 'trying', 'focus', 'spirituality', 'just', 'have', 'soul', 'own']",N/A

But I don't feel that it complety deserves it. Having seem all the nominees for that category, I feel that ""Brother Bear"" is my third choice for the Oscar, but that does not stop it from being a fun time at the movies. It has the voice talents of Joaquin Phoenix, and Micheal Clarke Duncan, and it is good for kids as it is for adults.The story is about Kenai, Denahi, and Sitka. They are three brothers in prehistoric times,where mammoths rule the world. The youngest of the three is Kenai, whose is ready to recieve his totem, a symbol that will lead him for the rest of his life. But when the villiage shaman Tanana gives him the totem of love he is very disappointed. But he goes on a journey when a bear takes a basket of fish that he was supposed to guard. While finding it, he has an encounter with a giant bear. His other two brothers find Kenai, but while trying to stop the bear, Sitka ends up dying. Kenai wants his revenge, and he goes on a mission to destroy the bear. But the ghost of Sitka wants Kenai to live to his totem, and he turns him into a bear. Thr problem is that Denahi thinks that the bear not only killed Sitka, but also Kenai, and he looks for revenge.Kenai learns that he will have to go to where the light touches the Earth to talk about him being a bear with Sitka. He goes a journey and meets Koda, a young bear cub, who was seprated from his mother when hunters attacked them. He also meets two moose named Rutt and Tuck. Kenai does not want Koda to hang around with him, but when he learns that Koda knows where the light touches the Earth, he decides to let him stick around. Throughout his journey, he learns more about what it is like to be a bear, and what Sitka wanted him to learn. This all leads up to a tragic discovery, and the problem with Danahi, and how he following them, looking for revenge.""Brother Bear"" was a fun, quick, time at the movies, but if your looking for a better animated film either rent ""Finding Nemo"" or see ""The Triplets of Belleville."" It was funny and sweet, but its problem is that it is a regular Disney movie. It's has similiar qualites to ""Bambi"" and ""Dumbo"" and even ""Finding Nemo."" I only wish that Disney would start getting a new story idea. It's more of a rental movie instead of seeing it in the theatre. I liked how it is done with drawn animation instead of complete computer animation, and this is one of the last.

One of the forsaken few is ""Brother Bear."" Even though it was nominated for an Academy Award and made a sizable amount at the box office, it never stuck in the minds of viewers the way ""Aladdin,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" or ""The Lion King"" did.Disney gives audiences another opportunity to experience the touching tale of Kenai with their 3-disc Special Edition Blu-ray collection of ""Brother Bear"" and ""Brother Bear 2."" As usual, both movies are restored and feature Disney's Enhanced High Definition Picture and Sound.In the original, a careless boy named Kenai is magically changed into a bear in post-Ice Age North America. The Spirits transformed him to teach the boy valuable life lessons. Kenai meets an assortment of interesting creatures in his adventures through the forest, including bear cub Koda, two moose named Rutt and Tuke, woolly mammoths, raucous rams, and others.The story continues with ""Brother Bear 2"" as Kenai embarks on a journey to break the strong bonds between himself and his friend Nita. If the bond remains unbroken, it could ruin Nita's marriage plans with another man and possibly hurt his relationship with his brother Koda.There's obviously a change in quality between ""Brother Bear"" and ""Brother Bear 2."" One was made to be released in theaters whereas the other went straight-to-DVD. Most children won't notice the difference, but their parents will.Both movies benefit from the high-definition treatment they were given. The picture on each film is clean and vibrant. The 5.1 surround sound puts viewers in the middle of the action with excellent audio effects, touching dialogue, and a bombastic musical score.There are plenty of extra features included for ""Brother Bear."" Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas provide audio commentary. A few featurettes entitled ""Art Review,"" ""Bear Legends,"" and ""Making Noise: The Art of Foley"" are here also. ""Paths of Discovery: The Making of 'Brother Bear'"" is made up of four segments going behind the scenes of the production. Deleted scenes and outtakes are included as well.A never-before-heard song entitled ""Fishing Song,"" the song ""Transformation"" with its original lyrics, the sing-along song ""On My Way,"" and Phil Collins' music video for ""Look Through My Eyes"" round out the special features. ""Brother Bear 2's"" bonus material is made up of a featurette entitled ""Behind the Music"" and includes interviews with Producers Jim Ballantine and Susan Kirch, director Ben Gluck and other notable members of the sequel team.If you're an avid collector of Disney's Blu-ray upgrades, the ""Brother Bear / Brother Bear 2"" 3-Disc Special Edition is an essential entry in your home movie collection.

Adults will love the new Phil Collins music, children will fall in love with the adorable bear cub, Koda, and everyone is sure to love the moose, voiced by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas. The theme of ""Brother Bear"" is seeing through another's eyes. Kenai is a member of the inuit tribe. When his eldest brother is killed by a bear, Kenai seeks revenge. To teach him a lesson, the spirit of his older brother turns him into a bear. He teams up with a cub named Koda and through their journey, Kenai learns to love him as a brother and sees the error of his previous lifestyle. ""Brother Bear"" is the kind of Disney film that leaves you happy and makes you want to watch it again and again.I think there could have been better special features. 2-disc dosen't mean the special features are great. The first disc has a ""Family Friendly"" widescreen version of the film. ""Brother Bear"" was filmed with two aspect ratios. The first 21 minutes of the film was filmed in the standard widescreen size, and after Kenai is turned into a bear, the movie switches to cinemascope, which is really widescreen. The ""Family Friendly"" version on the first disc keeps the normal widescreen for the whole film. When you watch the second disc, the whole movie is in cinemascope, so the first 21 minutes has black bars on the side of the film, as well as on the top and bottom. I prefer the original aspect ratio on the second disc, but I wish they would have kept the first part of the film looking normal on it. There are special features for kids, including games, a sing-along, and more outakes that weren't on the ending credits. For adults, there is a 45-minute making of. I wish there would have been art galleries and a more extensive behind the scenes. But this release is good for now.""Brother Bear"" is going to be remembered ten years down the road the same way that ""The Lion King"" is.

During this time, the hunter, becomes aware of his crimes against the bear and the animals who roam the wilderness. Throughtout the movie , Keinai (Jaoquin Phoenix)\then goes through a transformation of spirituality, moralsand good will.Kenai is part of a warrior hunter that also shows how NativeAmerican people love animals, contrary to what other peoplein states do, huting animals for sport in the US. Sitka(voice of DB Sweeney) is older and wiser native American soldier that was killed by an enormous bear although he loved the fauna. Kenai (voice of Joaquin Phoenix) demands justice and huntsfor bears.He looks for the bear that killed his  brother in spite of its other brother, objections of Denahi. Kenai finds the bear possible that killed its brother. Kenai during this fight withthe bear obtains a vision of the ghost of Sitka. Kenai causes possible the death of this bear. Despite a its shock, Kenai transforms into a  bear!Then  Kenai he sees what it is like to live like a bear and sees some of his own false ideasand prejudices agaisnt the bear and  nature itself.  Kenai  sees that bears like man, these animals have families who take to well-taken care of from their own means. Kenai also sees its own crime in killing a bear when helearns that the bear has a cub  named Koda. Koda is an orphaned lazy bear that is lost its mother. The twist for Koda and Kenai (now as bear) comes near the end when both make what really happened to the mother of Koda.Eventually Kenai learns the wrong that he did and comes to gripswith it and eventually changes his mentality against the bears.The 2 disc DVD for Brother Bear is nothing short of beautiful,showing featurettes, deleted scenes, commentary track and muchmore.

B. Sweeney, Joan Copeland, Michael Clarke Duncan, Harold GouldMusic Score Phil Collins and Mark MancinaSongs by Phil CollinsSurely it was not intended to reissue Mulan and Brother Bear at the same time because they bookend the peak and the valley of Walt Disney Animation Florida. But they are connected by their history as the first and last films produced at is now called Disney's Hollywood Studios (Lilo and Stitch was the middle feature). There is still an animation walk-through attraction at the Park, but there are no longer glimpses at working animators.Brother Bear could be considered one of the most overlooked of the post-Lion King era. Some critics made comparisons, which are not untrue, but this is a very different film in style and pretension. It is a very simple fable rather than a sweeping saga.Like a classic fable, the theme is broader than the story depicted. This is really a story about intolerance and hatred that is counteracted when the protagonist walks in the other's shoes, or in this case, paws. Another film that invites comparison is the more recent Brave, since both showcase humans that become bears, but again, the focus is very different here, aside from mutual understanding.It is fortunate that Joaquin Phoenix was available at the time to do the voice of Kenai; it is an excellent performance. SCTV's Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas are pitch perfect as moose versions of their McKenzie brothers (and deliver comic gold on their in-character audio commentary).But the star of Brother Bear is Jeremy Suarez as Koda. He's still very much a working actor all these years later, and rightly so. Koda's not just cute, he commands the scenes in which he appears and directs the emotional pull of the story.Phil Collins, who is one of the best musical partners to work in Disney films, according to what Disney music president Chris Montan told me (Collins would make himself constantly available even from his Switzerland home), again creates songs that have a viable pop sound but don't sound dated it all today.2004 2-Disc DVD & 2013 Blu-ray Bonus Features- Koda's Outtakes- Rutt & Tukes Commentary- ""Through My Eyes"" Video- Brother Bear Games (Bone Puzzle; Find Your Totem)- ""On My Way"" Sing-Along Song- Bear Legends: Native American Tales- Making Noise: The Art of Foley- Art Review- Paths of Discovery: The Making of Brother Bear- Deleted Scenes (Where's Koda?; Confession; Muri the Squirrel)- ""Fishing Song (Never Before Heard Song)- ""Transformation Song"" with Original Phil Collins Lyrics)2013 DVD Bonus Features:- Koda's Outtakes- Rutt & Tuke's Commentary- ""Through My Eyes"" Video- Brother Bear Games (Bone Puzzle; Find Your Totem)- ""On My Way"" Sing-Along Song- Bear Legends: Native American Tales- Making Noise: The Art of Foley- Art ReviewBrother Bear 2 (2006)Disney Blu-ray & DVD (March 12, 2013)Directed by Benjamin GluckThe Voices of Patrick Dempsey, Jeremy Suarez, Rick Moranis, Dave Thomas, Andrea Martin, Catherine O'Hara, Mandy Moore, Michael Clarke Duncan, Wendy Malick, Kathy NajimyMusic Score by Dave MetzgerSongs by Melissa Etheridge, Matthew Gerrard and Robbie NevilThe sequel to Brother Bear falls between  ""what were they thinking"" and ""that was better than I expected.""The overall look, though not quite as detailed, is very accurately captured from the first film. Joaquin Phoenix is replaced by Patrick Dempsey, only a breath away from his big TV splash as TV as ""McDreamy.""Dempsey's voice is noticeably higher than that of Phoenix, but it stands him in good stead for his squabbles with his leading lady, voiced by Mandy Moore, who later voiced Rapunzel for Disney.Brother Bear was about tolerance and tradition, the sequel is more of a rom-com triangle that isn't exactly full of surprises but at the same time a nice way to spend some time with some wonderful characters again. It avoids most of the deadly rom-com clich, thanks to a solid script and some nice tunes by Melissa Etheridge.Best of all, we SCTV fans get two more legends to enjoy, now Andrea Martin and Catherine O'Hara play lady moose who are wooed pathetically by the goony moose we met in the first film, again voiced by Moranis and Thomas. They provide the true highlights. I would have liked to see more of them in one form or another, these are great animated comic characters voiced by four of the best in the business.2013 Blu-ray Bonus Feature- Behind the Music of Brother Bear II2006 & 2013 DVD Bonus Features- Behind the Music of Brother Bear II- Trample Off, Eh?

Brother Bear chronicles the lives of three Inuit brothers who are torn apart after the death of the oldest one. The youngest of the two (Kenai) remaining seeks to avenge his brother's death by taking the life of a bear. With blind rage, he ends up taking the life of a mother bear and ends up being transformed into a bear as a tribulation and journey of growth. He then befriends a cub (Koda), unbeknownst to him is the cub of the mother bear he killed, and the two journey all over Alaska so Kenai can change back into a human. Along the way, they meet colorful characters, share stories and have adventures. The best part of the film is the score done by Phil Collins (Tarzan).The bonus features are a treat.

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[2, 2]","IN A NUTSHELL: HIGH QUALITY ANIMATION & A GOOD KID-FRIENDLY STORYThis may be a walk-a-mile in his/her shoes in order to gain understanding and comprehension formula film, but it is a very entertaining one. What's more, it relates very nicely to children of all ages, though the younger the better it seems. The animation is hand-drawn and set in very soft-yet-bright, pleasing-to-look-at tones. I think the use of light and color in this film adds greatly to the magical theme, making it moving to behold. The story, which involves three brothers and a self-discovery process for each of them, is definitely a worthwhile one that children seem quite willing to sit down and enjoy. Unlike many recent animated films by Disney, this one has excellent pacing, coupled with a mix of action and plot that seems quite natural and unhurried.WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT: [some plot spoilers]Three young men coming of age have their lives and destinies intertwined with a bear and her soon-to-be orphaned in the process cub. What ensues is an outdoor odyssey into fantasy which includes a spirtual epiphany with the aid of the suddenand magical personification of all the animals in the forest.BUT THERE'S MORE -- LOT'S MORE: 2-DISK EDITIONANIMALS - LOTS OF THEM: We have Bears at the Salmon Run plus two dopey moose and, of course, they all talk. We have Mammoths giving the bears and moose a lift and a forest filled with animals that think this new bear on the block [Brother Bear Kenai] is a bit crazy. Leading the way to an animal epiphany for Kenai, is Koda, the orphaned cub whose situation is of Kenai's making. To complicate matters, all during this journey for Kenai and Koda, Denahi [Kenai's brother] is tracking the bear that he believed was responsible for the death of his brothers. Unknown to Denahi, however, that bear is now Kenai. How this story plays itself out is at the core of ""Brother Bear"".Joaquin Phoenix  - Kenai [Voice]Jeremy Suarez  - Koda [Voice]Jason Raize  - Denahi [Voice]Rick Moranis  - Rutt [Voice]Dave Thomas  - Tuke [Voice]D.B.

The 2-DVD set has many features, however, our youngest son won't let us put them on as he prefers the film itself.BOTTOM LINE: BRILLANTLY ANIMATED TALKING ANIMALS & ACTION: NEVER GETS OLD!Having five children whose ages vary by nearly twenty years means we are fluent in animated films and have come to appreciate them on different levels.

Although ""Brother Bear"" doesn't compare with gold standard Disney films as ""Beauty and the Beast"" and the first version of ""The Lion King"", it does well enough on its own merits without having to be compared with them.I write as an adult who loves animation and story, and sometimes I hate going to the movies where people insist on bringing their kids. And tonight, I thought I'd avoid this and would have the screen room to myself when unfortunately some people with their kids came and, out of the whole doggone empty room, chose to sit all around me, and were obviously more interested in their popcorn than the movie!So, I'm forced to tune them out and try to enjoy the movie, anyway. My first surprise was hearing Tina Turner's voice on the theme! I knew that she had retired from touring, but apparently she's still recording. It was great to hear her again! I also thought First Nation people depicted were done rather realistically, only I don't know if they represent a real tribe or not. But, I came to enjoy a movie, not do research. And as usual, the animals themselves were great. I remember how Disney used to draw cartoon bears...thankfully, these are much more realistic.Sensually, the colors are fabulous. The opening sequence is good, but not impressive like...oops, I said I wouldn't compare. The imagery is what amazed me so much about it. I loved the antelope scene, and the snowstorm was fabulous! The professional reviewer said the CGI was shocking; I didn't find it so, personally. In my opinion, CGI is a part of animated film from now on, so get over it. I think that if preferring CGI to not be there is like wishing cars built in 2004 still had fishtails!I was impressed with the voice actors and didn't realize who they were until the end credits, which I always stay for. Part of me always cringes, though, when they do things like use an African-American's voice for a black bear, for example.To sum up, I don't know what kids will think of it; there are no bodies shown and no blood; if they don't know what death is, they need to get out more. If you are an adult, in my opinion this is not the worst animated film you'll ever see in your life. And if you want to take your kids to see it, fine, but don't assume no adults will want to see it by themselves, and don't assume they want to be around your kids, either!",4,"Surprisingly, I liked it!",1069977600,"11 28, 2003",2003,2398,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'about', 'lot', 'animated', 'films', 'Brother', 'Bear', ""n't"", 'compare', 'gold', 'standard', 'Disney', 'films', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'first', 'version', 'Lion', 'King', 'well', 'enough', 'own', 'merits', 'having', 'be', 'compared', 'them.I', 'write', 'adult', 'who', 'animation', 'story', 'sometimes', 'hate', 'going', 'movies', 'where', 'people', 'insist', 'bringing', 'kids', 'tonight', 'thought', ""'d"", 'avoid', 'would', 'have', 'screen', 'room', 'myself', 'when', 'unfortunately', 'people', 'kids', 'came', 'whole', 'doggone', 'empty', 'room', 'chose', 'sit', 'were', 'obviously', 'more', 'interested', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'So', ""'m"", 'forced', 'tune', 'out', 'try', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'anyway', 'My', 'first', 'surprise', 'was', 'hearing', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'voice', 'theme', 'knew', 'had', 'retired', 'touring', 'apparently', 'still', 'recording', 'was', 'great', 'hear', 'again', 'also', 'thought', 'First', 'Nation', 'people', 'depicted', 'were', 'done', 'rather', 'realistically', 'only', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'represent', 'real', 'tribe', 'not', 'came', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'not', 'do', 'research', 'usual', 'animals', 'were', 'great', 'remember', 'how', 'Disney', 'used', 'draw', 'cartoon', 'bears', 'thankfully', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'realistic.Sensually', 'colors', 'are', 'fabulous', 'opening', 'sequence', 'good', 'not', 'impressive', 'oops', 'said', 'would', ""n't"", 'compare', 'imagery', 'what', 'amazed', 'so', 'much', 'loved', 'antelope', 'scene', 'snowstorm', 'was', 'fabulous', 'professional', 'reviewer', 'said', 'CGI', 'was', 'shocking', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'so', 'personally', 'opinion', 'CGI', 'part', 'animated', 'film', 'now', 'so', 'get', 'think', 'preferring', 'CGI', 'not', 'be', 'wishing', 'cars', 'built', '2004', 'still', 'had', 'fishtails', 'was', 'impressed', 'voice', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'who', 'were', 'end', 'credits', 'always', 'stay', 'Part', 'always', 'though', 'when', 'do', 'things', 'use', 'African-American', 'voice', 'black', 'bear', 'example.To', 'sum', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'kids', 'will', 'think', 'are', 'bodies', 'shown', 'blood', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'death', 'need', 'get', 'out', 'more', 'are', 'adult', 'opinion', 'not', 'worst', 'animated', 'film', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'life', 'want', 'take', 'kids', 'see', 'fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'assume', 'adults', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'assume', 'want', 'be', 'kids', 'either']",N/A

My son was just mesmerized through the entire movie and says it is one of his most favorite movies ever.Warning, though. There is a bit of violence in this movie. Not as much, or as senseless, as the violence found in Lilo and Stitch or Tarzan, but it does have some. However, the overiding message of the movie is that Love is more powerful than Hate. So I would say that the violence is put in the movie to show the contrasts between hate (hurtful and unproductive) and love (peaceful and joyful).Another moral of the story is that you should not judge other's action for you may not know what their incentive or motivation is. Walk a mile in their shoes before you pass judgement.  This moral doesn't stand out, but it is still there.Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas coming together to act as two brother moose that talk and act like the McKenzie Brothers from Strange Brew was funny and sure put me in the mood to pick that movie up again sometime.

The animation is fantastic and the music is really the centerpiece of the film. Phil Collins and Tina Turner have turned in Disney's best soundtrack since the legendary Lion King. Joaquim Phoenix voices Kenai, the main character who is transformed into a bear by the spirit of his late brother to teach him the meaning of love. Kenai encounters Koda, a bear cub searching for his mother and the two become friends (eventually). The two moose voiced by Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis provide the comic relief, they basically have just resumed their Mckenzie Brothers schtick from Strange Brew but hey it's still funny.

618160,A2WJSVSBXEYEF,B00005JMFH,Jefferson T. Packer,"[0, 7]","This is a film about neolithic peoples with Tina Turner and Phil Collins providing the background music - which should give you an idea of how realistic it is likely (not) to be.""Brother Bear"" is a typical Disney animated film - long on visual beauty, short on reality.The neolithic peoples depicted here are Hallmark card versions of the real thing - the most astonishing thing about them is that they apparently have time to do something besides struggle to get enough to eat and work to keep from freezing to death.  These characters spend a lot of time talking, thinking and praying - all of which certainly happened, just not nearly in the quantities displayed here, if we can glean anything from archeological evidence.The most harmful lesson in this film, is that when the characters say, ""I'm sorry"" to someone they've been a complete jerk to, that person (or bear) forgives them immediately and everyone is OK again.  Also, when the characters defy the spirits, and then realize their error and ask for help, help (in the form of an eagle) arrives immediately.This is a terrible lesson to teach children.  The truth is that when you are a jerk to people, they very often stop loving you and go away forever.  The truth is that the spirits help us in this world at their whim, and often not at all, at least in any way we can recognize.  When the ""Ice Man"" fell down that crevasse, I'm sure he was hanging there, wishing the spirits would arrive to help him get out.  They didn't, and he froze to death.  End of story, except for our current study of his well-preserved body.This is the truth about the world, and especially the truth about the neolithic period.  I've got nothing against films that showcase the human spirit, and neolithic peoples certainly had plenty of it to survive their time and place.  What I've got a problem with, is films that tell children that the world is much more forgiving than it actually is, and this film, for all its visual beauty, commits that crime.And if we're going to show characters having spiritual hallucinations, let's be honest about where they came from:  a combination of starvation, dehydration and probably some kind of natural drug such as peyote or cannabis.Of course, then it wouldn't be a Disney film for kids - it would be too close to reality for that.  This film will probably be loved most by that group of revisionists who want to picture American Indian life as an idyllic paradise of natural and spiritual beauty, where the horses and the women have the same hairstyles and everyone has perfectly white teeth.

618168,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B00005JMFH,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[0, 1]","BROTHER BEAR may not achieve the ""classic status"" most of Disney's other films have received, but it's a definite improvement over last year's TREASURE PLANET.  Produced by Disney's Orlando Animation unit, who made the wonderful MULAN in addition to LILO AND STITCH, one cannot help but expect good material.  Those expectations are almost completely fulfilled.  BROTHER BEAR is actually the weakest of the three Orlando productions; while it is indeed a beautiful, fun movie, it falls short of a classic.  It ranks on the levels of a preivous Disney production, THE FOX AND THE HOUND -- well animated and enjoyable, but hardly worthy of ""masterpiece"" status.The tale, set by a snowy mountain ""where the lights touch"", involves three Alaskan brothers -- Sitka, the eldest (voiced by D.B. Sweeney); Denahi, the tease (Jason Raize); and ultimately, impulsive and hot-tempered Kenai (Joaquin Phoenix).  About ten minutes into the picture, Sitka dies in an avalanche in trying to protect his brothers from a bear, and Kenai, burning with immature rage, swears vengeance... and succeeds in killing the bear.  In an amazingly animated sequence, Kenai is transformed into a bear himself, and pursued by the now battle-hardened Denahi (who believes he is dead).  Kenai finds an unlikely ally in an orphaned bear cub, Koda (Jeremy Suarez), as he sets off for the glowing lights in order to regain his right to be human again.  His relationship with Koda eventually melts the frost in his heart, and he learns that compassion is a very valuable force.  (He also discovers, painfully, that the bear he killed was actually Koda's mother.)Sure, the synopsis above doesn't sound inspiring, but it's told, for the most part, very well through gorgeous animation.  When Kenai becomes a bear, the screen becomes wider as if to illustrate a bear's point of view -- a technically unique touch.  Koda, in addition, is arguably the highlight of the show.  Eager-to-please and earnest, this little chatterbox of a cub has the sort of fire to warm Kenai's frosty heart, and delivers some of the best lines in the film.  Phil Collins once again lends his golden voice to the movie by contributing six songs, which are bouncy and pleasant to say the least if not memorable.  Unfortunately, there are gripes I have about two numbers.  The first, sung by Tina Turner, is a little weak; the second one which plays during a very crucial moment in the movie (the scene where Kenai informs Koda how his mother died) dampens what should have been a heartwrenching sequence.  Employing chilling background music would probably have been a better choice.  In fact, recent animated productions have proven how they can tell an effective story *without* relying on songs.They've also proven that comic sidekicks are not always required.  In this case, the two moose who make most of the comedy, Rutt and Tuke (Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis), feel both contrived in both the flow of the story and plot; their humor is, for the most part, good, but there's nothing we haven't already seen from these kind of comedians, and they could have been featured in a different story.  Actually, after the first 20 minutes before Kenai becomes a bear, the movie has a lot of comic moments... and ends abruptly and unsatisfyingly, too.  Although there are funny outtakes in the closing credits, I was left feeling cold, as if the movie had some brilliant ideas but couldn't come to grips with its resolution.All in all, BROTHER BEAR *is* a decent, well-animated piece of family entertainment.  It has a lot of high merits and interesting concepts.  I liked the film, but I don't consider it one of Disney's best.The DVD, by the way, features yet another good, solid transfer from the Mouse House and an interesting (although somewhat extraneous) amount of extras:  the best of which is an alternate version of Kenai's confession to Koda (without the loudly-mixed, out-of-place Phil Collins song).  This version, IMO, *should* have remained in the picture, as it packs more of an emotional punch than the final version ever did.",3,"Pleasant, but hardly one of Disney's best.",1070150400,"11 30, 2003",2003,4077,"['BROTHER', 'BEAR', 'may', 'not', 'achieve', 'classic', 'status', 'most', 'Disney', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'received', 'definite', 'improvement', 'last', 'year', 'TREASURE', 'PLANET', 'Produced', 'Disney', 'Orlando', 'Animation', 'unit', 'who', 'made', 'wonderful', 'MULAN', 'addition', 'LILO', 'AND', 'STITCH', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'expect', 'good', 'material', 'expectations', 'are', 'almost', 'completely', 'fulfilled', 'BROTHER', 'BEAR', 'actually', 'weakest', 'three', 'Orlando', 'productions', 'indeed', 'beautiful', 'fun', 'movie', 'short', 'classic', 'levels', 'preivous', 'Disney', 'production', 'THE', 'FOX', 'AND', 'THE', 'HOUND', 'well', 'animated', 'enjoyable', 'hardly', 'worthy', 'masterpiece', 'status.The', 'tale', 'set', 'snowy', 'mountain', 'where', 'lights', 'touch', 'three', 'Alaskan', 'brothers', 'Sitka', 'eldest', 'voiced', 'D.B', 'Sweeney', 'Denahi', 'tease', 'Jason', 'Raize', 'ultimately', 'impulsive', 'hot-tempered', 'Kenai', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'ten', 'minutes', 'picture', 'Sitka', 'avalanche', 'trying', 'protect', 'brothers', 'bear', 'Kenai', 'burning', 'immature', 'rage', 'swears', 'vengeance', 'killing', 'bear', 'amazingly', 'animated', 'sequence', 'Kenai', 'transformed', 'bear', 'pursued', 'now', 'battle-hardened', 'Denahi', 'who', 'dead', 'Kenai', 'unlikely', 'ally', 'orphaned', 'bear', 'cub', 'Koda', 'Jeremy', 'Suarez', 'off', 'glowing', 'lights', 'order', 'regain', 'right', 'be', 'human', 'again', 'relationship', 'Koda', 'eventually', 'frost', 'heart', 'compassion', 'very', 'valuable', 'force', 'also', 'painfully', 'bear', 'killed', 'was', 'actually', 'Koda', 'mother', 'Sure', 'synopsis', 'above', ""n't"", 'sound', 'inspiring', 'told', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'gorgeous', 'animation', 'When', 'Kenai', 'bear', 'screen', 'wider', 'illustrate', 'bear', 'point', 'view', 'technically', 'unique', 'touch', 'Koda', 'addition', 'arguably', 'highlight', 'show', 'Eager-to-please', 'earnest', 'little', 'chatterbox', 'cub', 'sort', 'fire', 'warm', 'Kenai', 'frosty', 'heart', 'best', 'lines', 'film', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'once', 'again', 'golden', 'voice', 'movie', 'contributing', 'six', 'songs', 'are', 'bouncy', 'pleasant', 'say', 'least', 'not', 'memorable', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'gripes', 'have', 'about', 'two', 'numbers', 'first', 'sung', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'little', 'weak', 'second', 'one', 'very', 'crucial', 'moment', 'movie', 'scene', 'where', 'Kenai', 'Koda', 'how', 'mother', 'died', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'heartwrenching', 'sequence', 'Employing', 'chilling', 'background', 'music', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'choice', 'fact', 'recent', 'animated', 'productions', 'have', 'proven', 'how', 'can', 'tell', 'effective', 'story', '*without*', 'relying', 'songs.They', ""'ve"", 'also', 'proven', 'comic', 'sidekicks', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'required', 'case', 'two', 'moose', 'who', 'make', 'most', 'comedy', 'Rutt', 'Tuke', 'Dave', 'Thomas', 'Rick', 'Moranis', 'feel', 'contrived', 'flow', 'story', 'plot', 'humor', 'most', 'part', 'good', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'kind', 'comedians', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'featured', 'different', 'story', 'Actually', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'Kenai', 'bear', 'movie', 'lot', 'comic', 'moments', 'abruptly', 'unsatisfyingly', 'too', 'are', 'funny', 'outtakes', 'closing', 'credits', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'cold', 'movie', 'had', 'brilliant', 'ideas', 'could', ""n't"", 'come', 'grips', 'resolution.All', 'BROTHER', 'BEAR', 'decent', 'well-animated', 'piece', 'family', 'entertainment', 'lot', 'high', 'merits', 'interesting', 'concepts', 'liked', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'one', 'Disney', 'best.The', 'DVD', 'way', 'yet', 'good', 'solid', 'transfer', 'Mouse', 'House', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'extraneous', 'amount', 'extras', 'best', 'alternate', 'version', 'Kenai', 'confession', 'Koda', 'loudly-mixed', 'out-of-place', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'song', 'version', 'IMO', '*should*', 'have', 'remained', 'picture', 'more', 'emotional', 'punch', 'final', 'version', 'ever', 'did']",N/A

(Sigh)There are these three brothers, Sitka, Denahi and Kenai, who live back in the time of wooly mammoths. (It must be the pre-historic U.S. because our heroes speak American English.) The older one, Sitka, is drowned during an encounter with a bear. The hot-headed youngest, Kenai, goes after the animal to exact vengeance, and eventually kills it (off-screen and bloodlessly, natch). Then, some nebulous Supreme Intelligence transforms Kenai into a cute, juvenile bear, who's subsequently stalked by a now-vengeful Denahi. While on the run, Kenai teams up with an even cuter bear cub. It's through this exercise in trans-species awareness that the audience and Kenai get the message, i.e., we humans need to become one with the other creatures of the planet - or at least bears - and grow out of our self-centered attitude. All to a score of the same general tone as the song &quot;I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing in Perfect Harmony&quot;. (Another sigh)BROTHER BEAR just oozes political correctness, though why the empathy doesn't extend to the salmon that both on-screen humans and bears kill by the score isn't explained. Perhaps it's because bears are warm and furry, and salmon are cold and slimy. Perhaps salmon just don't have a sufficiently obnoxious political action committee.Most of the film has that two-dimensional animation of the traditional Disney cartoon. Only sporadically are there quasi three-dimensional effects that even approach what a jaded viewer expects nowadays. In any case, BROTHER BEAR can't begin to compare with the eye-popping and clever FINDING NEMO.The children in the audience seemed to enjoy this film. Grouch that I am, I could only fidget to keep from falling asleep.

It has a good message to it and the story is very enjoyable to watch.  The cub, &quot;Koda,&quot; is fun to watch and the moose brothers, &quot;Rut and Tuke,&quot; are just hilarious.  The movie's message of loving one another and protecting family is fantastic.  The entire film has a good &quot;family&quot; feel to it without coming across as too gushy or preachy.It's also a great comedy.  There are multiple scenes in the film that make children of all ages laugh.  My two-year old loves watching &quot;Koda&quot; be silly.  &quot;Rut and Tuke&quot; provide great comedy for the adults.  The character of &quot;Kenai&quot; is also very funny when he comes to realize that he isn't human anymore.The only shortcoming of this film is the music.  Don't get me wrong, it is nice to listen to, but it doesn't sound as inspired as past Disney efforts.  As another reviewer stated, the music reminds me a lot of &quot;Tarzan.&quot;The DVD is chock full of extras.  I like both the &quot;family-friendly&quot; version of the film and the original theatrical aspect that are offered.  The games are fun and the &quot;Bones&quot; game is actually quite challenging for the younger lot.  There are deleted scenes(including one with a character not seen in the movie) and funny &quot;outtakes&quot; a la &quot;Bug's Life.&quot;  &quot;Stitch&quot; even makes a cameo appearance in the extras!  There are a number of other extras, including a documentary on different aspects of the film.  You can pick and choose which parts you want to watch.Overall, I highly recommend this film.  Some folks have knocked it for the violence in the early sequences of the movie.  This is ashame, because the scenes are handled with care and there is no blood actually viewed on-screen.  If you're bothered by the violent sequences, watch the movie without your kids first and prepare yourself to explain the scenes to your child.  I honestly don't think this is necessary, but I know how sensitive some folks can be.  Others have questioned the spiritism used in the film.  Considering this movie takes place at the time of the Inuit people, I find no fault with the totems or spirits involved.  Don't let a few naysayers in the crowd ruin your experience.This is a fine family movie that can be enjoyed by all.",4,Fun Family Movie,1080777600,"04 1, 2004",2004,2339,"['quot', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'quot', 'good', 'family', 'movie', 'good', 'message', 'story', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'cub', 'quot', 'Koda', 'quot', 'fun', 'watch', 'moose', 'brothers', 'quot', 'Rut', 'Tuke', 'quot', 'are', 'just', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'message', 'loving', 'one', 'protecting', 'family', 'fantastic', 'entire', 'film', 'good', 'quot', 'family', 'quot', 'feel', 'coming', 'too', 'gushy', 'preachy.It', 'also', 'great', 'comedy', 'are', 'multiple', 'scenes', 'film', 'make', 'children', 'ages', 'laugh', 'two-year', 'old', 'loves', 'watching', 'quot', 'Koda', 'quot', 'be', 'silly', 'quot', 'Rut', 'Tuke', 'quot', 'great', 'comedy', 'adults', 'character', 'quot', 'Kenai', 'quot', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'when', 'realize', ""n't"", 'human', 'anymore.The', 'only', 'shortcoming', 'film', 'music', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'nice', 'listen', ""n't"", 'sound', 'as', 'inspired', 'past', 'Disney', 'efforts', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'music', 'lot', 'quot', 'Tarzan.', 'quot', 'DVD', 'chock', 'full', 'extras', 'quot', 'family-friendly', 'quot', 'version', 'film', 'original', 'theatrical', 'aspect', 'are', 'offered', 'games', 'are', 'fun', 'quot', 'Bones', 'quot', 'game', 'actually', 'quite', 'challenging', 'younger', 'lot', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'including', 'one', 'character', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'funny', 'quot', 'quot', 'la', 'quot', 'Bug', 'Life.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Stitch', 'quot', 'even', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'extras', 'are', 'number', 'other', 'extras', 'including', 'documentary', 'different', 'aspects', 'film', 'can', 'pick', 'choose', 'parts', 'want', 'watch.Overall', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'folks', 'have', 'knocked', 'violence', 'early', 'sequences', 'movie', 'ashame', 'scenes', 'are', 'handled', 'care', 'blood', 'actually', 'viewed', 'on-screen', ""'re"", 'bothered', 'violent', 'sequences', 'watch', 'movie', 'kids', 'first', 'prepare', 'explain', 'scenes', 'child', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'necessary', 'know', 'how', 'sensitive', 'folks', 'can', 'be', 'Others', 'have', 'questioned', 'spiritism', 'used', 'film', 'Considering', 'movie', 'place', 'time', 'Inuit', 'people', 'find', 'fault', 'totems', 'spirits', 'involved', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'few', 'naysayers', 'crowd', 'ruin', 'experience.This', 'fine', 'family', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed']",N/A

Kenai is an impulsive and adventurous young man who feels insulted as he learns that his totem to live by is love.  When Kenai later finds out that a bear has taken their basket with salmon he sets out to get the basket back, however his two older brothers follow him.  Kenai's brother Sitka ends up getting killed as he saves the two other brothers, which awakens anger with Kenai who sets out to seek his revenge on the bear.  Kenai ends up killing the bear, but in the process is turned into a bear through earthly magic.Brother Bear carries valuable lessons about several themes such as love, anger, and friendship.  The story also portrays a scenario of loss and the anger that follows loss, which many of us call revenge.  The story details a moral message that revenge is also harmful to others who are not involved in the matter. Kenai turning to a bear teaches the lesson from the opposite perspective, which will hopefully open up doors the for the audience to ponder the issue at hand.  In addition, there are several comical situations that offer belly-aching laughter which reduces the sadness that the theme carries.

Everything they do these days is simply pathetic.""Brother Bear"" is hardly an exception.  I work for a movie theater that happened to show this newest Disney fiasco, and I was able to see it for free -- but, although my MONEY wasn't wasted at all, I felt my time was EXTREMELY wasted.Throughout the movie, I was bored stiff.  ""Brother Bear"" is a cookie-cutter movie, with paper doll characters, a tired and predictable plot, stale pop music, and watered-down animation that is merely a shadow of what Disney used to produce.  I was able to predict almost minute by minute EXACTLY what would happen in this movie.  There were no surprises, and nothing fresh at all.  The best part of the movie was the bloopers at the end.  I'll grant you, the moose are rather funny, but not nearly enough to redeem this movie.  The only reason I didn't simply walk out of the theater was because I HAD to see it for work.  You have to PAY me to see this movie, that's the only way I'll sit through it.I can't believe how many people actually liked this movie.  I have read reviews claiming that this was ""superbly executed,"" ""inspiring,"" ""fresh and unique,"" ""beautifully animated,"" and some even dare say that this is ""classic Disney, worthy to be placed with Bambi, Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King.""  Inspiring?  The plot was anything but, it was overly maudlin and excessively boring.  Fresh and unique is hardly how I would describe this incredibly tired plotline.  The animation is hardly beautiful, absolutely nothing in comparsion with Beauty and the Beast or Snow White or even Lilo and Stitch.  And to say that this movie can be rated as high as such wonderful classics as Bambi, Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King is an insult to those beautifully done movies.Some have argued that this movie is fine for kids, even if it might not be as interesting to adults.  Well, my 8-year-old brother didn't like it any better than my grandparents did.  NO ONE should be subjected to this garbage, it's an insult to the IQ.I have lost all faith in Disney animators.  I think it's sad that they have forsaken quality for quantity.  In the last several years, the only decent things they've come out with AT ALL are ""Lilo and Stitch,"" ""The Emperor's New Groove,"" and ""Mulan.""  But this one falls in with such travesties as ""Hercules,"" ""Pocahontas,"" and ""Treasure Planet.""

I had seen the trailer many many times over a period of a few months and it has done the trick, I was getting excited to see Brother Bear.And now, here it was - BROTHER BEAR - I had really high expectations, and only marginally did it not live up to my expectation. The story of a man who is magically turned into a bear. The songs by Phil Collins were catchy and beautiful. And let me tell you about the two Canadian moose. They keep saying ""eh"" at the end of each sentence, they sometimes talk about you - right in front of you - in cough language - thinking there's no chance you'll understand what they're saying, and they're basically hilarious. If you want to see more of the moose you should buy the Brother Bear Disney Sing Along Songs DVD.Another interesting thing you'll find is that the film starts off in 4:3 and then opens up to a widescreen, about a quarter of the way through the movie. I think this is to symbolize that the man (who has now been turned into a bear) is truly having his eyes opened to the world around him.Disney have made quite an effort with this 2-Disc set, so you should have fun working your way through the special features.

However, how many remakes and versions of the same movies can you make?  Disney finally smashed through the originality barrier with &quot;Brother Bear,&quot; an original story inspired by Inuit legends and myths.The story revolves around Kenai and Koda, a bear and cub.  The story is complex, and may lose some viewers the first time around.  Kenai kills Koda's mother shortly after his brother dies in an encounter with Koda's mother.  However, Kenai's brother, sensing that Kenai has a lesson to learn about life, has Kenai changed into a bear, and then has Kenai meet up with Koda.  It takes some time for Kenai to discover that Koda is the cub of the bear he killed, but when he learns the story behind the encounter between himself and the mother bear, he realizes that there are two sides to every story.Incidentally, another review stated that this movie does not contain Christian values.  This movie is entertainment, but I think the core lessons, that there are two viewpoints in every encounter, love instead of hate, friendship, forgiveness, and understanding, would all seem to be Christian values to me, at least, Christian values as I understand them.While the movie has a &quot;G&quot; rating, the movie does contain death, as does real life.  &quot;The Lion King&quot; also had death.  As much as we often do not like to face death, it is a fact of life.  The death in this movie is not glorified, nor is it bloody.  One of the central points of the movie is that the man and the bear had to completely different viewpoints regarding the encounter, and the lesson that should be learned is that when wild animals act in a certain way, they are completely in character with how they were made.Two additional characters were added to this movie to lighten the serious nature of the topic.  Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas voice Rutt and Tuke, a pair of moose, in a reprise of the roles as the McKenzie brothers from the long-defunct SCTV.  While not every one of their jokes is funny, they do still provide good comic relief throughout the movie.  They also do a commentary track that my daughter and I thought was hilarious, though my wife did not care for it.The extras on this DVD are wonderful.  In addition to the Rutt and Tuke commentary, there are funny out takes, interesting deleted scenes, and quite a lot about the music.  The video of the Bulgarian women's choir and how the Phil Collins' song was translated into Inuit was fascinating.This movie is a breakthrough for Disney.  It is a completely original story.  It is a little violent and intense for children under the age of five or six, but older children should be captivated.  The movie is a wonderful basis for parental discussions about many of the attributes we would like to pass on to our children.  I recommend this movie highly to open minded people who see the art and creativity in this movie.",5,"It's Amazing, It's Original",1081728000,"04 12, 2004",2004,2976,"['Disney', 'been', 'limping', 'along', 'recently', 'capitalizing', 'what', 'have', 'always', 'done', 'well', 'However', 'how', 'many', 'remakes', 'versions', 'same', 'movies', 'can', 'make', 'Disney', 'finally', 'smashed', 'originality', 'barrier', 'quot', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'quot', 'original', 'story', 'inspired', 'Inuit', 'legends', 'myths.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Kenai', 'Koda', 'bear', 'cub', 'story', 'complex', 'may', 'lose', 'viewers', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'Kenai', 'Koda', 'mother', 'shortly', 'brother', 'encounter', 'Koda', 'mother', 'However', 'Kenai', 'brother', 'sensing', 'Kenai', 'lesson', 'learn', 'life', 'Kenai', 'changed', 'bear', 'then', 'Kenai', 'meet', 'up', 'Koda', 'time', 'Kenai', 'discover', 'Koda', 'cub', 'bear', 'killed', 'when', 'story', 'encounter', 'mother', 'bear', 'are', 'two', 'sides', 'story.Incidentally', 'review', 'stated', 'movie', 'not', 'contain', 'Christian', 'values', 'movie', 'entertainment', 'think', 'core', 'lessons', 'are', 'two', 'viewpoints', 'encounter', 'love', 'instead', 'hate', 'friendship', 'forgiveness', 'understanding', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'Christian', 'values', 'least', 'Christian', 'values', 'understand', 'movie', 'quot', 'G', 'quot', 'rating', 'movie', 'contain', 'death', 'real', 'life', 'quot', 'Lion', 'King', 'quot', 'also', 'had', 'death', 'As', 'much', 'often', 'do', 'not', 'face', 'death', 'fact', 'life', 'death', 'movie', 'not', 'glorified', 'bloody', 'One', 'central', 'points', 'movie', 'man', 'bear', 'had', 'completely', 'different', 'viewpoints', 'regarding', 'encounter', 'lesson', 'should', 'be', 'learned', 'when', 'wild', 'animals', 'act', 'certain', 'way', 'are', 'completely', 'character', 'how', 'were', 'made.Two', 'additional', 'characters', 'were', 'added', 'movie', 'lighten', 'serious', 'nature', 'topic', 'Rick', 'Moranis', 'Dave', 'Thomas', 'voice', 'Rutt', 'Tuke', 'pair', 'moose', 'reprise', 'roles', 'McKenzie', 'brothers', 'long-defunct', 'SCTV', 'not', 'one', 'jokes', 'funny', 'do', 'still', 'provide', 'good', 'comic', 'relief', 'movie', 'also', 'do', 'commentary', 'track', 'daughter', 'thought', 'was', 'hilarious', 'wife', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'it.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'Rutt', 'Tuke', 'commentary', 'are', 'funny', 'interesting', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'quite', 'lot', 'music', 'video', 'Bulgarian', 'women', 'choir', 'how', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'song', 'was', 'translated', 'Inuit', 'was', 'fascinating.This', 'movie', 'breakthrough', 'Disney', 'completely', 'original', 'story', 'little', 'violent', 'intense', 'children', 'age', 'five', 'six', 'older', 'children', 'should', 'be', 'captivated', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'basis', 'parental', 'discussions', 'many', 'attributes', 'would', 'like', 'pass', 'children', 'recommend', 'movie', 'highly', 'open', 'minded', 'people', 'who', 'see', 'art', 'creativity', 'movie']",N/A

Sometimes their advice is the only thing you may have to fall back on. Its starts with a tragedy and this threat come full circle at the end of the film. The perspective is that of the Bear. The Bear sees man as the Monster Man sees Bear as the monster. The spirit of one of the brother intervenes and shows the perspective of the other.Three brothers are voiced by Joaquin Phoenix (Signs, Gladiator), D.B. Sweeney (Dinosaur, Fire In the Sky) and Jason Raize (First Feature). The lovable but obnoxious youthful bear Koda is played by Jeremy Suarez (Jerry McGuire, Bernie Mac Show).Of the comic relief is mainly supplied by the two Moose - Rutt and Tuke played by Dave Thomas (Coneheads, Boris and Natasha) and Rick Moranis (The Flintstones, Honey I Shrunk 1,2,3,4). There perspective gives tribute to the Canadian traditions of the old past.The movie has a warm heart and is fun and family orientated.

Kenai and Denahi both have to learn together how to be men with no help because Sitka his brother has died. Kenai then strays away from the ways to learn about the totem because he wants to get his brother back and during this entire film his brother is guiding him back to the right path to becoming a man.Kenai in the story was turned into a bear but before he was even turned into a bear he had killed a female bear that later on had a child named Koda. Koda was a great character she helped Kenai to care and love again after all he has been through in his life. The story talks about how Kenai and Koda's time together but also during the story we witness the ritual ceremony of Kenai who receives his bear love totem and how religious belief's aid Kenai to get through his journey. Kenai goes and gets influential help through bears which show that spiritual side as we use in certain religions to call on spirits for guidance and help. This also shows in the movie that the bear's lives are just like human lives.The movie Brother Bear relates to the World Religions on how they use the spirit world with ritual ceremonies.

618198,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JMFH,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[4, 4]","Let's just face facts here people, traditional animation is on the ropes and there is very little we can do about it. Computer generated imagery has become the new medium in the animation genre as we move forward through the 21st Century of filmmaking. Does this mean it is a permanent fixture? Not by a long shot! This is hardly the first time traditional hand-drawn animation has been faced with its own extinction. Back in 1986, before Wells and Eisner took charge of the Disney ship, the genre was hurt badly with failure after failure at the box office including Disney's own Black Cauldron, which, as advanced in material as it was, was far ahead of its time. Then suddenly in 1989, The Little Mermaid changed everything receiving critical acclaim and, more importantly to company investors, tremendous box office coinage. Beauty & the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King followed suit and each new release built on the success of the previous entry leading to a gigantic boom in the animation industry. Unfortunately, chinks have become apparent on the suited armor of the traditional animation empire due in part to financial, as well as critical, flops such as Disney's Treasure Planet and Dreamworks' Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas. Escalating successes from CGI animated features like Ice Age and Finding Nemo certainly haven't helped matters in this debate. Brother Bear and Home on the Range are part a coordinated last ditch effort for Disney to revitalize this staple of animation before it is too late.The story centers on a young arrogant man who goes through a magical transformation and eventually learns the meaning of friendship and brotherhood. Set in the Pacific Northwest long ago when woolly mammoths still roamed the earth, an ancient tribe of Native Americans celebrate the coming of age ceremony for one of their young adults, Keinai, a young man who still has yet to grow up. Unfortunately, the celebration is cruelly interrupted by the death of one of Keinai's brothers, killed by a bear who attempted to attack Keinai. The brash young man becomes so enraged by the event that he goes after the bear himself to avenge the death of his beloved brother. But when the great spirits in the sky transform Keinai into a bear, he receives a brand new perspective on life through another creature's eyes. Along the way to becoming a man, again, Keinai meets up with a young bear cub named Koda - ""Say it with me, KO-DA"" - as well as two goofy moose named Rutt and Tuke. With their help, Keinai gains a whole new perspective on the world and its creatures. The story of Brother Bear may not be the most original idea out of there, rumors were that Eisner dubbed this the bear version of The Lion King, and may not agree with everyone's political perspectives, at times this feels like hippie-dippy PETA propaganda, but the filmmakers do a wonderful job making this film unique despite that handicap. Rutt and Tuke may be the main draw but they are only the comic relief and are added all the appropriate moments, allowing the story to continue to flow even when they aren't present.Despite being different genres of animation, Brother Bear does share one similarity with Pixar's Finding Nemo, namely in fact that both films have practically no big name stars voicing their characters. Luckily Finding Nemo managed to find tremendous success in spite of this but Brother Bear may have a harder achieving that sort of milestone for itself. Joaquin Phoenix, who has become quite a rising star with prominent roles in such recent releases as Gladiator and M. Night Shyamalan's Signs, does a superb job voicing both the human and bear form of Keinai. The interaction between the characters of Keinai and Koda is priceless, at least in the eyes of children and their parents, and works on a number of emotional levels from heartwarming to humorous. Jeremy Suarez, who voices the young bear cub Koda, works well with Phoenix and gives a delightful performance despite no face time. The outlandish moose duo, voiced by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas, is quite possibly the biggest highlight of the film and join the ranks of such classic comic relief figures as Timon and Pumbaa as one of the best in Disney animation history. The only disappointment was the lack of Native American voices contributing to the film, the same problem Pocahontas ran into back in 1995, so it was quite surprising to see Disney making the same mistake here.Overall, Brother Bear, its own way, successfully revitalizes the traditional animation genre and brings it back to its roots with memorable songs and delightful talking animals, but won't do much in the way of stirring excitement amongst the movie-going public. Generally ignore those comments saying the film is too renascent of The Lion King - yeah, it's true (Eisner even admitted it), but so what? If you enjoyed The Lion King, why shouldn't you enjoy this, if only to a lesser degree? Brother Bear makes the story its own by combining breathtaking landscapes, memorable characters, and delightful voice talent to make it one of the most entertaining family features this year, though certainly not the best. Phil Collins, who worked on Tarzan back in 1999, returns to Disney with a slew of brand new songs and even a bit of extensive work on the film's musical score, a new venture for the talented artist. Each and every song works superbly except for the opening piece - the only squabble there is aimed at Tina Turner's singing, not the song itself. Had Collins been singing it then there wouldn't be a problem but, as it stands, it simply doesn't work. While we're on the subject of faults, one of the few problems for the animated feature is the fact that it starts off way too slow and it takes it quite awhile to really get going based on action. This isn't necessarily a big deal for children but it is a problem none the less. Bottom-line, Disney once again provides a wonderful family film that will not only appeal to the young set but the older adults as well. Parents need not fear of being bored to death thanks in part to Collins' songs and the comic duo of Rutt and Tuke, who provide several hilarious lines that won't get monotonous upon repetition - and believe it, with the kids, those lines will be repeated numerous times over upon viewing this film.

However, a week or two after viewing it, not much stands out. Of course there have been Disney epics that stick with you long after seeing them and sometimes for life. &quot;Lion King,&quot; was a movie like that for me. Disney seemed to lose their seemingly eternal flame of creativity and ingenuity when they got in this rut of rehashing classic stories in animated form. I think Disney had set themselves up from previous successes with impossible expectations from the general public with each and every release. If the name Disney is on it...it's got to be good. &quot;Brother Bear,&quot; though an entertaining watch, just doesn't deliver the goods like other Disney blockbusters.Kudos to Disney for attempting to return to original story lines like Brother Bear. In scope, &quot;Brother Bear's&quot; literary counterpart seems to best be found in Doctor Seuss' &quot;Lorax.&quot; Through the story of a human that becomes a bear, the tables are turned and the hunter becomes the hunter. &quot;Brother Bear,&quot; reinforces that the manner we as humans see issues in life all depends on the perspective. There are some funny moments along the way provided by Rick Moranis and partner as two moose traveling companions. There is some darkness (sure enough every good Disney story line usually involves an animal parent getting killed off) and some redemption as characters grow and get wise on things of nature and humanity's role and responsibility to nature. I found the music by Phil Collins to be fairly lackluster and not up to other Disney standards.If you are considering buying, I'd say there are other animated fair out there I'd turn to first. All in all, though Brother Bear is a step in the right direction for Disney...let's hope they return to form.--MMW",3,Environmental Spun Animation,1091318400,"08 1, 2004",2004,1851,"['not', 'Disney', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'lackluster', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'However', 'week', 'two', 'viewing', 'not', 'much', 'out', 'course', 'have', 'been', 'Disney', 'epics', 'stick', 'long', 'seeing', 'sometimes', 'life', 'quot', 'Lion', 'King', 'quot', 'was', 'movie', 'Disney', 'seemed', 'lose', 'seemingly', 'eternal', 'flame', 'creativity', 'ingenuity', 'when', 'got', 'rut', 'rehashing', 'classic', 'stories', 'animated', 'form', 'think', 'Disney', 'had', 'set', 'previous', 'successes', 'impossible', 'expectations', 'general', 'public', 'release', 'name', 'Disney', 'got', 'be', 'good', 'quot', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'quot', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'just', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'goods', 'other', 'Disney', 'blockbusters.Kudos', 'Disney', 'attempting', 'return', 'original', 'story', 'lines', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'scope', 'quot', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'quot', 'literary', 'counterpart', 'best', 'be', 'found', 'Doctor', 'Seuss', 'quot', 'Lorax.', 'quot', 'story', 'human', 'bear', 'tables', 'are', 'turned', 'hunter', 'hunter', 'quot', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'quot', 'reinforces', 'manner', 'humans', 'see', 'issues', 'life', 'perspective', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'way', 'provided', 'Rick', 'Moranis', 'partner', 'two', 'moose', 'traveling', 'companions', 'darkness', 'sure', 'enough', 'good', 'Disney', 'story', 'line', 'usually', 'animal', 'parent', 'getting', 'killed', 'off', 'redemption', 'characters', 'grow', 'get', 'wise', 'things', 'nature', 'humanity', 'role', 'responsibility', 'nature', 'found', 'music', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'be', 'fairly', 'lackluster', 'not', 'up', 'other', 'Disney', 'standards.If', 'are', 'considering', 'buying', ""'d"", 'say', 'are', 'other', 'animated', 'fair', 'there', ""'d"", 'turn', 'first', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'step', 'right', 'direction', 'Disney', 'let', 'hope', 'return', 'form.', 'MMW']",N/A

618206,A1C7BWPATO40VA,B00005JMFH,Nathan T.,"[0, 4]","This is totally my opinion and it doesn't matter if you think the review is helpful or not.The movie has nice pictures, but I think its missing all the rest. The music is the kind of music where you wanna keep it down from letting your neighbors hear, cause it sounds lame and ""gay"" in guy terms. You know I'm hating, the music is alright, I'm just asking too much. The movie plot, if you've seen alot of animation films like me, are just too NOT original. Disney just sticks to what works best, never really changing until something fails. They should think about that when they made ""Princess Diary"". The movie is way too predictable, it was never, ever unpredictable. It might surprise amauteurish movie watchers but people who have been analyzing films for years, you get the drill. I predicted the whole movie before it even started! Whats worst, 85% of my predictions came true as if they took the ideas straight from my crooked mind. The characters are just too NOT ""original"". If you watch past disney animated films and then watch this, you'll see the difference is veryyyyyy littttttleee.What I'm asking directors to do is stop simply making films just to get money! They need to be ALOT more creative and make films because they LOVE to. Why do you think most sequels suck?

Kennedy,"[0, 0]","This is a fascinating movie with the right mix of comedy and drama along with teaching good morals and a little history about indigenous religions.  It starts off with three brothers, the youngest, Kenai, is to receive his token.  He is still very immature and his actions certainly reflect that.  He receives his token from the shaman, which happens to be the bear of love.  He is disappointed with his token since he believes bears are mean animals and love isn't manly.  His brothers then discover that Kenai failed with his duties and let the bear get their fish.  Kenai goes to find the basket of fish and runs into the bear.  He instigates the bear and his brothers catch up to help.  The oldest brother ends up taking his own life to save them.  Kenai blames the bear once again and goes to hunt it down for revenge.  He upsets the spirits by killing the bear and is then transformed into the bear.  Once the other brother catches up to Kenai, he only sees the bear and blames the bear on Kenai's death.  The shaman instructs Kenai to go to where the lights touch the earth to seek forgiveness.  Lost and confused, he runs into a bear cub, Koda, who has lost his mom.  He thinks Koda is a pain but agrees to help him find her.  Kenai discovers that Koda knows the way to where the lights touch the earth so they embark on the journey together.  In the meantime, Kenai's brother keeps following seeking revenge.  Brief comic relief is also provided through the animals along the way.  Koda and Kenai begin to form a friendship and bond together.  Then they discover that Koda's mom isn't lost but that Kenai killed her and has taken over her body.  Koda eventually learns forgiveness and both have learned important life lessons.  Once Kenai reaches the place where the lights touch the earth he runs into his other brother again.  The spirit brother intervenes and transforms Kenai back to himself.  However, Kenai realizes he needs to raise and watch after Koda.  His brothers respect his decision and he is returned to being a bear.In addition to the plot of the story, it also gives us a better appreciation and understanding of American Indians and their indigenous religions.  This story was based on Kenai's vision quest.  It teaches us how American Indians are more in touch with their natural environment and their beliefs reflect that.  The Indians believe they are equal to the animals, respect their environment, and believe in the circle of life.  The shaman provides guidance and acts as an intermediary for the tribe.  They use the animal tokens as guidance during the vision quest.  The sacred lights provide guidance while allowing them closeness with the spirits, similarly to other indigenous religions. Therefore, there is a lot of interaction with the spirit world as well.",5,Fascinating Movie,1201132800,"01 24, 2008",2008,2800,"['fascinating', 'movie', 'right', 'mix', 'comedy', 'drama', 'teaching', 'good', 'morals', 'little', 'history', 'indigenous', 'religions', 'three', 'brothers', 'youngest', 'Kenai', 'receive', 'token', 'still', 'very', 'immature', 'actions', 'certainly', 'reflect', 'token', 'shaman', 'be', 'bear', 'love', 'disappointed', 'token', 'bears', 'are', 'mean', 'animals', 'love', ""n't"", 'manly', 'brothers', 'then', 'discover', 'Kenai', 'failed', 'duties', 'let', 'bear', 'get', 'fish', 'Kenai', 'find', 'basket', 'fish', 'bear', 'bear', 'brothers', 'catch', 'up', 'help', 'oldest', 'brother', 'up', 'taking', 'own', 'life', 'save', 'Kenai', 'bear', 'once', 'again', 'hunt', 'down', 'revenge', 'spirits', 'killing', 'bear', 'then', 'transformed', 'bear', 'Once', 'other', 'brother', 'up', 'Kenai', 'only', 'bear', 'bear', 'Kenai', 'death', 'shaman', 'Kenai', 'go', 'where', 'lights', 'touch', 'earth', 'seek', 'forgiveness', 'Lost', 'confused', 'bear', 'cub', 'Koda', 'who', 'lost', 'mom', 'Koda', 'pain', 'help', 'find', 'Kenai', 'Koda', 'way', 'where', 'lights', 'touch', 'earth', 'so', 'embark', 'journey', 'together', 'meantime', 'Kenai', 'brother', 'following', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'Brief', 'comic', 'relief', 'also', 'provided', 'animals', 'way', 'Koda', 'Kenai', 'begin', 'form', 'friendship', 'bond', 'together', 'Then', 'discover', 'Koda', 'mom', ""n't"", 'lost', 'Kenai', 'killed', 'taken', 'over', 'body', 'Koda', 'eventually', 'forgiveness', 'have', 'learned', 'important', 'life', 'lessons', 'Once', 'Kenai', 'place', 'where', 'lights', 'touch', 'earth', 'other', 'brother', 'again', 'spirit', 'brother', 'intervenes', 'transforms', 'Kenai', 'back', 'However', 'Kenai', 'raise', 'watch', 'Koda', 'brothers', 'respect', 'decision', 'returned', 'being', 'bear.In', 'addition', 'plot', 'story', 'also', 'better', 'appreciation', 'understanding', 'American', 'Indians', 'indigenous', 'religions', 'story', 'was', 'based', 'Kenai', 'vision', 'quest', 'how', 'American', 'Indians', 'are', 'more', 'touch', 'natural', 'environment', 'beliefs', 'reflect', 'Indians', 'believe', 'are', 'equal', 'animals', 'respect', 'environment', 'believe', 'circle', 'life', 'shaman', 'guidance', 'intermediary', 'tribe', 'use', 'animal', 'tokens', 'guidance', 'vision', 'quest', 'sacred', 'lights', 'provide', 'guidance', 'allowing', 'closeness', 'spirits', 'similarly', 'other', 'indigenous', 'religions', 'Therefore', 'lot', 'interaction', 'spirit', 'world', 'well']",N/A

618219,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JMFH,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 18]","Brother Bear (Aaron Blaise and Robert Walker, 2003)Blaise and Walker, two of the guys who worked on Mulan, get into the director's chair for the first time for Brother Bear (a movie that I somehow missed was animated before I actually got to it). The last time Disney (well, a subsidiary) tried this trick, we got Monsters, Inc., perhaps the best Disney release of the past fifty years. This one doesn't fare so well.Three Native American brothers, Kenai (voiced Joaquin Phoenix of Gladiator fame), Denahi (singer Jason Raize), and Sitka (D. B. Sweeney of Strange Luck, Harsh Realm, and a number of other short-lived but excellent Fox TV series), live in an Indian village. On the day of Kenai's initiation into manhood, a bear gets into the feast. Kenai, looking for revenge, goes after it, and (really, through no fault of his own) kills it, although he loses Sitka in the process. In order to atone for his sin, Kenai is changed into a bear himself and sent on a quest, though he has no idea what the quest is.To save you some time, let me tell you the triune moral of the story  First, you should never hurt an animal, not even if it's about to tear your head off and eat your brain for breakfast. Second, if you do harm an animal, even through no fault of your own, something bad will happen to you. Third, do whatever you must to atone for hurting an animal. (It should come as no surprise that the subtext to all this is that animals are better than people.) This could have all been handled with at least a little aplomb, despite the obvious stupidity of the message itself, had the points not been hammered home with (no pun intended) a week-old dead herring about halfway through the movie; Kenai, in bear form, encounters a large band of other bears at a salmon run. The other bears are doing what bears normally do at a salmon run (i.e., eating). Throughout the whole scene (accompanied by a suitably sugary and brainless Phil Collins jingle sure to be nominated for the best song Academy Award), Kenai, unlike every other bear in the scene, does not eat a single fish. After all, he's not really a bear, he's a human, and has to learn the lesson that humans can't harm animals.Disgusted yet? You should be. The worst part is that without all the messagemongering, this was a half-decent movie.

618230,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00005JMFH,Scott Schiefelbein,"[5, 9]","""Brother Bear"" easily falls into the second tier of Disney animation -- nowhere near the class of ""The Lion King,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" and the other high-water marks, but along the lines of ""Pocahantas"" and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame.""  Preachy, simplistic, and plagued by Phil Collins tunes (where, o where, did ""Against All Odds"" go?), ""Brother Bear"" is nevertheless a beautiful film with some good supporting characters.""Brother Bear"" is set in Alaska, which according to Disney is the Garden of Eden in Winter.  Three brothers -- Sitka, Denahi, and Kenai -- engage in gentle sibling rivalry and hijinx in this wonderland as the youngest, Kenai, eagerly awaits his manhood ceremony where he will receive his totem.  Eagerly awaiting a ""manly"" totem like the Sabretooth of Bravery, Kenai is disappointed to receive the Bear of Love.  Kenai is no fan of bears, which we will see is what passes for subtle irony in this heavy-handed film.Soon, one of the dastardly bears takes advantage of Kenai's laziness and steals a bunch of the tribe's salmon.  Kenai goes after the bear, only to see his beloved oldest brother Sitka die trying to save Kenai and Denahi (this scene is pretty scary for younger kiddies, by the way).  In death, Sitka's spirit becomes a magical eagle, and he has plans for his naive youngest brother.Kenai, distraught at Sitka's death, casts aside his bear totem and chases after the bear (who survived Sitka's heroics).  After a dangerous battle atop a mountain, Kenai exacts his revenge . . . only to see Sitka's spirit show up and transform Kenai into a bear.  This animation scene is pretty impressive, although there are some minor continuity problems as the bear's corpse disappears once or twice before officially being whisked away into the heavens.Kenai, bear-hater that he is, is pretty upset to be transformed into a bear.  Fortunately for the audience, Kenai the Bear can speak Animal -- the language shared by all animals regardless of species -- and this allows Kenai to speak with some characters who are more interesting than he is.  One of these is Koda, a diminutive bear cub who can't shut up.  Two other great supporting characters are Rutt and Tuke (Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis, who channel Bob and Doug McKenzie for these parts), two yoga-loving moose.  If you have not seen SCTV or ""Strange Brew,"" check them out before watching ""Brother Bear"" and your enjoyment of the movie will skyrocket.Kenai must find ""where the lights touch the earth,"" which will see him Transformed Back Into a Man, or where he will Learn the Answers to His Questions, or some other cliche.  Completely confused about his destination, Kenai is forced to adopt Koda as his guide.  In perhaps the best-handled subplot, Kenai learns that Koda's mother is the bear Kenai killed avenging Sitka.Complicating matters is the vengeance now sworn by Denahi, the middle brother.  Denahi blamed Kenai, not the bear, for Sitka's death, and his last words with Kenai (the human) were harsh.  Coming on the mountaintop after the battle, Denahi mistakenly believes that the bear killed Kenai, and chases after Kenai like Ahab.  This leads to some scary fight scenes between the brothers.Being Disney, this movie is wrapped up in a tight little package.  Had Disney attempted to make a less-musical film (such as ""Mulan,"" which is superior film to ""Brother Bear""), ""Brother Bear"" would have been more enjoyable.  But the songs by Phil Collins are just too much sugar for this already-sweet story and are the general low point of the movie.To sum it up, ""Brother Bear"" is fine family entertainment for younger tykes who won't catch the cheap sentimentalism or be bothered by the too-on-the-nose songs.  But if your child is at the age where Pixar's ""The Incredibles"" is the coolest movie ever, you may have missed your ""Brother Bear"" window.A surprisingly good package of DVD extras -- most notably a comic commentary by the two moose, Tuke and Rutt -- makes this a very good DVD for a pretty good film.",3,"Mediocre Disney Effort, but Good for Little Tykes",1122249600,"07 25, 2005",2005,4009,"['Bear', 'easily', 'second', 'tier', 'Disney', 'animation', 'nowhere', 'class', 'Lion', 'King', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'other', 'high-water', 'marks', 'lines', 'Pocahantas', 'Hunchback', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'Preachy', 'simplistic', 'plagued', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'tunes', 'where', 'o', 'where', 'did', 'Against', 'All', 'Odds', 'go', 'Bear', 'nevertheless', 'beautiful', 'film', 'good', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Bear', 'set', 'Alaska', 'according', 'Disney', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'Winter', 'Three', 'brothers', 'Sitka', 'Denahi', 'Kenai', 'engage', 'gentle', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'hijinx', 'wonderland', 'youngest', 'Kenai', 'eagerly', 'manhood', 'ceremony', 'where', 'will', 'receive', 'totem', 'Eagerly', 'awaiting', 'manly', 'totem', 'Sabretooth', 'Bravery', 'Kenai', 'disappointed', 'receive', 'Bear', 'Love', 'Kenai', 'fan', 'bears', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'subtle', 'irony', 'heavy-handed', 'film.Soon', 'one', 'dastardly', 'bears', 'advantage', 'Kenai', 'laziness', 'bunch', 'tribe', 'salmon', 'Kenai', 'bear', 'only', 'see', 'beloved', 'oldest', 'brother', 'Sitka', 'trying', 'save', 'Kenai', 'Denahi', 'scene', 'pretty', 'scary', 'younger', 'kiddies', 'way', 'death', 'Sitka', 'spirit', 'magical', 'eagle', 'plans', 'naive', 'youngest', 'brother.Kenai', 'distraught', 'Sitka', 'death', 'aside', 'bear', 'totem', 'chases', 'bear', 'who', 'survived', 'Sitka', 'heroics', 'dangerous', 'battle', 'mountain', 'Kenai', 'revenge', 'only', 'see', 'Sitka', 'spirit', 'show', 'up', 'transform', 'Kenai', 'bear', 'animation', 'scene', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'are', 'minor', 'continuity', 'problems', 'bear', 'corpse', 'once', 'twice', 'before', 'officially', 'being', 'whisked', 'away', 'heavens.Kenai', 'bear-hater', 'pretty', 'upset', 'be', 'transformed', 'bear', 'Fortunately', 'audience', 'Kenai', 'Bear', 'can', 'speak', 'Animal', 'language', 'shared', 'animals', 'regardless', 'species', 'Kenai', 'speak', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'One', 'Koda', 'diminutive', 'bear', 'cub', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shut', 'up', 'Two', 'other', 'great', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'Rutt', 'Tuke', 'Dave', 'Thomas', 'Rick', 'Moranis', 'who', 'channel', 'Bob', 'Doug', 'McKenzie', 'parts', 'two', 'yoga-loving', 'moose', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'SCTV', 'Strange', 'Brew', 'check', 'out', 'watching', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'will', 'skyrocket.Kenai', 'must', 'find', 'where', 'lights', 'touch', 'earth', 'will', 'see', 'Transformed', 'Back', 'Into', 'Man', 'where', 'will', 'Learn', 'Answers', 'Questions', 'other', 'cliche', 'Completely', 'confused', 'destination', 'Kenai', 'forced', 'adopt', 'Koda', 'guide', 'perhaps', 'best-handled', 'subplot', 'Kenai', 'Koda', 'mother', 'bear', 'Kenai', 'killed', 'avenging', 'Sitka.Complicating', 'matters', 'vengeance', 'now', 'sworn', 'Denahi', 'middle', 'brother', 'Denahi', 'blamed', 'Kenai', 'not', 'bear', 'Sitka', 'death', 'last', 'words', 'Kenai', 'human', 'were', 'harsh', 'Coming', 'mountaintop', 'battle', 'Denahi', 'mistakenly', 'bear', 'killed', 'Kenai', 'chases', 'Kenai', 'Ahab', 'scary', 'fight', 'scenes', 'brothers.Being', 'Disney', 'movie', 'wrapped', 'up', 'tight', 'little', 'package', 'Had', 'Disney', 'attempted', 'make', 'less-musical', 'film', 'such', 'Mulan', 'superior', 'film', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'Bear', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'songs', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'sugar', 'already-sweet', 'story', 'are', 'general', 'low', 'point', 'movie.To', 'sum', 'up', 'Bear', 'fine', 'family', 'entertainment', 'younger', 'tykes', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'catch', 'cheap', 'sentimentalism', 'be', 'bothered', 'too-on-the-nose', 'songs', 'child', 'age', 'where', 'Pixar', 'Incredibles', 'coolest', 'movie', 'ever', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'Bear', 'window.A', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'package', 'DVD', 'extras', 'most', 'notably', 'comic', 'commentary', 'two', 'moose', 'Tuke', 'Rutt', 'very', 'good', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'good', 'film']",N/A

618235,A35GHITTG3WX7E,B00005JMFH,Taran Wanderer,"[1, 1]","For the first time in, oh, I don't know how many years, Disney managed to once again deliver a movie that from start to finish is a delight.  Released after ""Treasure Planet"" (2002), Brother Bear is a wonderful film that beautifully blends a great original story, characters and music, carefully crafted together with a working balance between drama and comedy, together with stunning visuals and lively animation.  No Disney animated film had managed to do this since ""Tarzan"" (1999), or perhaps even ""The Lion King"" (1994).  A financial success, ""Brother Bear"" saw rather mixed reviews from critics; the fact that the film was released during a time in which Disney animation seems to be facing hard years might have had something to do with that.  To me, ""Brother Bear"" brought hope that Disney will one day be able to return to deliver masterpieces like those from the golden ages, ""Bambi"" (1942), ""Lady and the Tramp"" (1955) or ""The Rescuers"" (1977) to name a few.""Brother Bear"" tells the story of Kenai and his two brothers; the story takes place long, long ago in North America.  On the day in which he is to become a man, Kenai receives the token that is to guide him through life: the bear of love.  Kenai is upset, for he believes that bears have no feelings, that they're savage creatures who'll look for any excuse to harm, hunt and even kill a human.  He is jealous of the tokens given to his older brothers, the eagle of guidance for the eldest, Sitka and the wolf of wisdom for the middle brother, Denahi.  One day, Kenai neglects his duties, and the hard work of the brothers goes to waste as a bear comes and steals all of their fish.  Kenai, after being scolded by Denahi, decides to go after the bear and soon finds himself in great danger.  His two brothers run to save him, which eventually costs the life of Sitka as he attempts to save his two brothers.  Lead by anger and grief, Kenai feels that the only thing for him to do is to hunt the bear that killed his brother.  Kenai doesn't realize the mistake he's made and soon is surrounded by the Great Spirits of the Earth and transformed into a bear.  Tanana, the shaman woman, tells him that it is time for him to make up for what he's done wrong and sends him in search of the place where the lights touch the earth.  Lost and confused in his journey, Kenai meets a little bear cub named Koda, whom he finds to be a complete pain in the neck.  Unable to get rid of him, Kenai promises to help Koda find his mother, while at the same time looking for ""where the lights touch the earth"", for Koda seems to know the place.  Together through forests and over mountains, Kenai and Koda develop a brotherly affection for each other and meet all kinds of interesting characters and creatures, as well as the antagonizing appearance of Denahi, who does not recognize Kenai and believes the bear to have killed his brother.  Before the journey is through, Kenai will learn to take responsibility for his actions and to see through the eyes of what had once been his enemy, at the same time learning what really makes a man.""Brother Bear"" is a very touching story.  For the first time in a very long time, Disney does not overshadow the dramatic elements of the film with trashy comedy and out-of-place comic characters, instead, like I've already said, the film maintains a very good balance of good comedy and effective drama and emotion.  Characters like the moose, Rutt and Tuke are added for effective comic relief, while the rest of the main characters are well developed.  ""Brother Bear"" may be the last great Disney animated feature for a long time still, because it doesn't look like things are getting any better, so I recommend anyone who loves a great Disney tale to give this one a try.  The film includes great music from Phil Collins as well as a breathtakingsoundtrack.

If so, how many stars do we need to describe the delightful experience of watching &quot;Little Mermaid&quot;?  Ten stars?  Or twenty?There is nothing wrong with &quot;Brother Bear,&quot; and that is the problem with it.  I'm talking about the originality.  OK, the story itself is interesting.  Young native American Kenei is turned into a bear by the mystrious power after inconsiderately killing another bear.  Kenai, to return human, has to go to the mountain with a kiddie bear Koda.  There you see the story of friendship between animals and humans, against the background of Mother Nature.Probably &quot;Brother Bear&quot; would appeal to the fans who prefer traditional Disney animations.  And that is a good thing even though American market recently saw the change in animation films.  Pixar and Dreamworks are now the force to be reckoned with, and their creative minds are not to be ignored.  Clearly, compared with &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; or &quot;Shrek,&quot; &quot;Brother Bear&quot; looks old-fashioned.And again I say, that is not a bad thing.  &quot;Brother Bear&quot; uses traditional 2-D animation, which is soft in color and natural  in movement.  And the story, which revers the culture of native Americans, is not without merit, being always engaging and smooth, and there is even a slightly surprise ending.  The message is a worhty one, and vocal actors (starring Joaquin Phoneix as Kenei) are doing a good job.  And the two silly mooses are joy to see, thanks to Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas.However ... sorry, but these flaws.  Phil Collins songs are just forgettable (where is Elton John?), and at many scenes I thought to myself: &quot;I have seen it before&quot; when I saw the bears dancing to the tune; when I saw the picture on the rock (is it in &quot;Ice Age&quot;?); or when I saw the glacier and manmoths (again, &quot;Ice Age&quot;... perhaps).

618245,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JMFH,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[5, 8]","Brother Bear isn't in quite the same league as Aladdin, Beauty and The Beast or even The Lion King but it's a solid, entertaining comic fable for kids. Adults will appreciate Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis reprising their Canadian cable access characters from SCTV. The twist is that both of them are reimagined as Moose. They provide much of the levity and some of the best comedic zingers of the film.The plot focuses on Kenai (Joaquin Phoenix)who is hunting down a bear he feels is responsible for his older brothers death. When he has his show down with the bear and kills it, his brother's spirit turns Kenai into a bear. The purpose in this seems to be to teach his brother a lesson in tolerance and to provide guidance for a young bear cub. Ironically enough Kenai is in turn hunted by his other brother who feels guilty for letting Kenai go off alone to find the bear in the first place.The score co-written by Phil Collins with a handful of catchy songs, is memorable although it lacks the depth of, say, Randy Newman. Still, they are hummable and kids will enjoy them which is their purpose in the film (that and to sell the soundtrack tie-in). The performances by actors Joaquin Phoenix, Jeremy Suarez (as Koda the bear cub that Kenai befriends), Robert Walker VII and Aaron Blaise are all strong. They manage to breathe life into characters that are less memorable than some that Disney has come up with in the past. Part of the blandness of the characters might be due to the fact that there are around six writers credited with working on the script.Brother Bear manages to display the warmth and Looney Tunes sense of humor that has replaced the milder Disney humor of early animated features. As a result, the film has a more contemporary and often funny edge that makes the film appealing to small children, preteens and adults. The animation itself is less complex and well detailed when compared to many previous efforts. Part of this could be due to the smaller box office returns for hand drawn animation since the advent of the computer generated films like Toy Story, Shrek, Finding Nemo and Ice Age. It's still a step above just about all of their former and current competition and is, for the most part, fluid and well animated.While Brother Bear might lack the memorable songs of Aladdin or the grand canvas of The Lion King, it has an entertaining story to tell and it is, for the most part, very well told. The box office for Brother Bear appears to show that there is still an interest in hand drawn animation as long as it has the right elements. Part of the problem with much of the recent Disney fare is the fact that it has seemed almost formulaic. It is here too but to a lesser degree. Surprisingly more edgy fare like The Emperor's New Groove and the well designed Treasure Planet didn't do all that well at the box office.You'll enjoy Brother Bear particularly if your expectations aren't of a Lion King type of film.",3,3 1/2 stars for latest Disney animated feature,1068940800,"11 16, 2003",2003,2953,"['Bear', ""n't"", 'quite', 'same', 'league', 'Aladdin', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'even', 'Lion', 'King', 'solid', 'entertaining', 'comic', 'fable', 'kids', 'Adults', 'will', 'appreciate', 'Dave', 'Thomas', 'Rick', 'Moranis', 'reprising', 'Canadian', 'cable', 'access', 'characters', 'SCTV', 'twist', 'are', 'reimagined', 'Moose', 'provide', 'much', 'levity', 'best', 'comedic', 'zingers', 'film.The', 'plot', 'Kenai', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'who', 'hunting', 'down', 'bear', 'responsible', 'older', 'brothers', 'death', 'When', 'show', 'down', 'bear', 'brother', 'spirit', 'Kenai', 'bear', 'purpose', 'be', 'teach', 'brother', 'lesson', 'tolerance', 'provide', 'guidance', 'young', 'bear', 'cub', 'Ironically', 'enough', 'Kenai', 'turn', 'hunted', 'other', 'brother', 'who', 'guilty', 'letting', 'Kenai', 'go', 'off', 'alone', 'find', 'bear', 'first', 'place.The', 'score', 'co-written', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'handful', 'catchy', 'songs', 'memorable', 'depth', 'say', 'Randy', 'Newman', 'Still', 'are', 'hummable', 'kids', 'will', 'enjoy', 'purpose', 'film', 'sell', 'soundtrack', 'tie-in', 'performances', 'actors', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Jeremy', 'Suarez', 'Koda', 'bear', 'cub', 'Kenai', 'Robert', 'Walker', 'VII', 'Aaron', 'Blaise', 'are', 'strong', 'manage', 'breathe', 'life', 'characters', 'are', 'less', 'memorable', 'Disney', 'come', 'up', 'past', 'Part', 'blandness', 'characters', 'might', 'be', 'due', 'fact', 'are', 'six', 'writers', 'credited', 'working', 'script.Brother', 'Bear', 'display', 'warmth', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'sense', 'humor', 'replaced', 'milder', 'Disney', 'humor', 'early', 'animated', 'features', 'result', 'film', 'more', 'contemporary', 'often', 'funny', 'edge', 'film', 'appealing', 'small', 'children', 'preteens', 'adults', 'animation', 'less', 'complex', 'well', 'detailed', 'when', 'compared', 'many', 'previous', 'efforts', 'Part', 'could', 'be', 'due', 'smaller', 'box', 'office', 'returns', 'hand', 'drawn', 'animation', 'advent', 'computer', 'generated', 'films', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Shrek', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'Ice', 'Age', 'still', 'step', 'above', 'just', 'former', 'current', 'competition', 'most', 'part', 'fluid', 'well', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'might', 'lack', 'memorable', 'songs', 'Aladdin', 'grand', 'canvas', 'Lion', 'King', 'entertaining', 'story', 'tell', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'told', 'box', 'office', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'show', 'still', 'interest', 'hand', 'drawn', 'animation', 'as', 'long', 'right', 'elements', 'Part', 'problem', 'much', 'recent', 'Disney', 'fare', 'fact', 'seemed', 'almost', 'formulaic', 'here', 'too', 'lesser', 'degree', 'Surprisingly', 'more', 'edgy', 'fare', 'Emperor', 'New', 'Groove', 'well', 'designed', 'Treasure', 'Planet', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'box', 'office.You', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'particularly', 'expectations', 'are', ""n't"", 'Lion', 'King', 'type', 'film']",N/A

This is a great movie with a wonderful story that is full of super songs and backed by a really nice musical score.This movie and Brother Bear 2 are currently our two-year-old daughter's favorite movies.  Both of our girls willingly watch this over and over.I highly recommend this movie, if for no other reason than you need to see it before you can fully appreciate Brother Bear 2, which I think is a ""must have"" in your library of ""kids movies"" that can be enjoyed by all ages. (By the way, I have never found any material on the second disc of any of the ""Two-Disc Special Edition series that contains anything of value. I do, however, always get the widescreen version.)[Postscript to the reviewer who wrote about ""neolithic life"": almost every movie requires a certain amount of ""suspension of disbelief""; fantasies like Brother Bear require it in super abundance! So what? I do not expect my two-year old and three-year old daughters to learn about the realities and inequities of life from a Disney movie; I will see that they know about that when the time comes.]",4,Excellent Movie -- A Wonderful Fantasy,1170892800,"02 8, 2007",2007,1242,"['only', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'saw', 'Brother', 'Bear', '2', 'writing', 'review', 'wanted', 'leave', 'room', 'rate', 'sequel', 'higher', 'great', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'story', 'full', 'super', 'songs', 'backed', 'really', 'nice', 'musical', 'score.This', 'movie', 'Brother', 'Bear', '2', 'are', 'currently', 'two-year-old', 'daughter', 'favorite', 'movies', 'girls', 'willingly', 'watch', 'over', 'over.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'other', 'reason', 'need', 'see', 'can', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'Brother', 'Bear', '2', 'think', 'must', 'have', 'library', 'kids', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'ages', 'way', 'have', 'never', 'found', 'material', 'second', 'disc', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'series', 'anything', 'value', 'do', 'however', 'always', 'get', 'widescreen', 'version', '[', 'Postscript', 'reviewer', 'who', 'wrote', 'neolithic', 'life', 'almost', 'movie', 'certain', 'amount', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'fantasies', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'require', 'super', 'abundance', 'what', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'two-year', 'old', 'three-year', 'old', 'daughters', 'learn', 'realities', 'inequities', 'life', 'Disney', 'movie', 'will', 'see', 'know', 'when', 'time', ']']",N/A
