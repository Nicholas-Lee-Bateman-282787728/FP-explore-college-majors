Anderson's book is a mature and sober study of complicated politics, complicated men and complicated times.Alas, this PBS documentary chooses to gloss over the complicated politics that led to the war in North America (nary a mention of the war's European theater) at the expense of explaining away the Indians' notorious cruelty as merely cultural differences and elevating the Indians to the status of equal players.  That sort of sugar coating is, I suppose, de riguer nowadays but let's face it, it is bull and it really has no place in any serious and scholarly historical works.  To make matters worse, the omnipresent Indians are almost ALWAYS mentioned as major players (even when their numbers are ridiculously low such as when 250 Canadian Mohawks fought alongside thousands of French soldiers!).While Anderson's book presented the Indians as a party of interest in the war, and at times as both prime movers to events as well as pawns, he never makes the politically correct excuses the makers of this documentary do.  Also, unlike the makers of the documentary, he never loses focus that his book is about ""The War That Made America"", where much of the emphasis is on events that shaped colonial political response to both the French and the Indians and, ultimately towards Britain, the mother country, not to the shafting of the Indians (which isn't to say that that didn't happen or that it wasn't important, but it had almost no bearing on the coming Revolutionary War).Ken Burns' documentary work remains the standard and this PBS docudrama doesn't come close to reaching it.",3,Uneven documentary based on a far better book,1220659200,"09 6, 2008",2008,1778,"['Anderson', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'attempted', 'introduce', 'reader', 'often', 'ignored', 'Indian', 'role', 'many', 'French', 'Indian', 'War', 'literature', 'succeeded', 'beautifully', 'Anderson', 'book', 'mature', 'sober', 'study', 'complicated', 'politics', 'complicated', 'men', 'complicated', 'times.Alas', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'chooses', 'gloss', 'complicated', 'politics', 'led', 'war', 'North', 'America', 'nary', 'mention', 'war', 'European', 'theater', 'expense', 'explaining', 'away', 'Indians', 'notorious', 'cruelty', 'merely', 'cultural', 'differences', 'elevating', 'Indians', 'status', 'equal', 'players', 'sort', 'sugar', 'coating', 'suppose', 'de', 'riguer', 'nowadays', 'let', 'face', 'bull', 'really', 'place', 'serious', 'scholarly', 'historical', 'works', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'omnipresent', 'Indians', 'are', 'almost', 'ALWAYS', 'mentioned', 'major', 'players', 'even', 'when', 'numbers', 'are', 'ridiculously', 'low', 'such', 'when', '250', 'Canadian', 'Mohawks', 'fought', 'alongside', 'thousands', 'French', 'soldiers', 'Anderson', 'book', 'presented', 'Indians', 'party', 'interest', 'war', 'times', 'prime', 'movers', 'events', 'as', 'well', 'pawns', 'never', 'politically', 'correct', 'makers', 'documentary', 'do', 'Also', 'makers', 'documentary', 'never', 'focus', 'book', 'War', 'That', 'Made', 'America', 'where', 'much', 'emphasis', 'events', 'shaped', 'colonial', 'political', 'response', 'French', 'Indians', 'ultimately', 'towards', 'Britain', 'mother', 'country', 'not', 'shafting', 'Indians', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'was', ""n't"", 'important', 'had', 'almost', 'no', 'bearing', 'coming', 'Revolutionary', 'War', '.Ken', 'Burns', 'documentary', 'work', 'standard', 'PBS', 'docudrama', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'reaching']",The War That Made America: The Story of the French and Indian War
965975,A3E2AB97PKT0Y8,B000E1MXZ0,Dr J,"[58, 65]","This long-awaited DVD on the French and Indian War is very good in some respects, but there are some serious setbacks. I don't think it delivers or lives up to what I expected. It's the first mini-series on the entire French and Indian War. There are other videos/DVDs on parts of the war (see my reviews of _When the Forest Ran Red_ and _George Washington's First War_), but this is the first that attacks the whole war. However, I never felt like the series was tied together very well.  It just seemed that I was watching four separate DVDs that were somehow related.  I never got a sense of the entire war.  In all, I felt like I was watching the above-mentioned DVDs again.  Second, it's interesting to watch, as there are very well-done reenactments.  It's almost like watching a movie. However, many of the scenes are quite intense and violent. Some scenes (there is even a disclaimer at the beginning of each DVD) are not appropriate for young children. Yes, war is violent, but some of the scenes seemed to be included for shock value.As far as the content goes, I have many issues.  Grant's raid on Fort Duquesne is not mentioned. The fall of Frontenac and Louisbourg are given only cursory treatment, which is surprising after the very detailed treatments of Braddock's defeat, Washington's early battles, and the fall of Fort William Henry.  The massacre after William Henry gets a lot of time and the DVD tries to downplay the whole incident by stating that not many people were actually killed with respect to the number reportedly killed.  I'm not sure why so much time is devoted to this (certainly because of the Last of the Mohicans movies).  But it's really not an important episode to the entire war--it should be a footnote.The role and portrayal of the Indians is almost unbelievable. It starts off with the 'happy Indian' idea, ""Dozens of Indian nations coexist in Eastern North America.""  There is no mention of the discord among the various tribes.  Many tribes suffered greatly at the hands of the Iroquois and wanted to throw off their yoke of oppression. Tribes sometimes aligned themselves with one side based on whom their enemies sided with. Another claim is almost stupid, ""Captives often had less to fear than they thought."" One captive is shown running a gauntlet; but the gauntlet is shown as being a very kind thing. Would that the hazing I got in highschool would have been so tame! The claim is made that the Indians sided with the French because the French were less likely to take the land from them (It's the old ""French traders vs. English settlers"" idea).  This claim is later contradicted, ""Without gifts, the Indians will abandon the French."" This statement really makes the Indians look like mercenaries who sell their souls for a few trinkets.  Unlikely. The Indians were not so stupid--they jumped ship because the English started winning and they wanted to be on the winning side.  The final claim about the Indians is just too much, ""The support of the Indian nations is necessary for ultimate victory.""  This is simply not true.  In the early stages of the war, every betting man would have put his money on the French. The English were so inept it stupifies the imagination.  However, by 1759, the English had shipped the largest army North America had ever seen and turned this into a European-style war.  The 'little war' with small bands guided by Indian scouts and allies was a thing of the past.  The frontier was simply a sideshow for the big battles of the North.  Quebec, the real nail in the coffin for the French, was a classic European-style battle. The Indians by this time had become nearly irrelevant (consider their treatment by the English after the war which led to Pontiac's Rebellion).  The West was nearly forgotten by this time.  Unfortunately, the set gives much more time to the early West and treats the later battles in the North only as a nuisance that must be given some coverage.My final criticism: this set really is the story of George Washington, not about the war itself. It seems like a retelling of the other two DVDs I mentioned--that's not bad, but not much is new.Well, is there anything that really stands out in this set? Yes, the section on the after war years leading up to the Revolution is fantastic. I can't say enough good about it.  It really underscores the differences in goals between the British and Americans.  The Americans wanted land and the British, well, I don't think they really knew what they wanted.  The Break seems almost inevitalbe.  This part is very well done.Is this set worth watching? Yes, but just keep in mind that it's a bit unbalanced and has some problems.",4,Fine set on French and Indian War,1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,4681,"['long-awaited', 'DVD', 'French', 'Indian', 'War', 'very', 'good', 'respects', 'are', 'serious', 'setbacks', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'up', 'what', 'expected', 'first', 'mini-series', 'entire', 'French', 'Indian', 'War', 'are', 'other', 'videos/DVDs', 'parts', 'war', 'see', 'reviews', '_When', 'Forest', 'Ran', 'Red_', '_George', 'Washington', 'First', 'War_', 'first', 'whole', 'war', 'However', 'never', 'felt', 'series', 'was', 'tied', 'together', 'very', 'well', 'just', 'seemed', 'was', 'watching', 'four', 'separate', 'DVDs', 'were', 'somehow', 'related', 'never', 'got', 'sense', 'entire', 'war', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'above-mentioned', 'DVDs', 'again', 'Second', 'interesting', 'watch', 'are', 'very', 'well-done', 'reenactments', 'almost', 'watching', 'movie', 'However', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'intense', 'violent', 'scenes', 'even', 'disclaimer', 'beginning', 'DVD', 'are', 'not', 'appropriate', 'young', 'children', 'Yes', 'war', 'violent', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'be', 'included', 'shock', 'value.As', 'far', 'content', 'have', 'many', 'issues', 'Grant', 'raid', 'Fort', 'Duquesne', 'not', 'mentioned', 'fall', 'Frontenac', 'Louisbourg', 'are', 'given', 'only', 'cursory', 'treatment', 'surprising', 'very', 'detailed', 'treatments', 'Braddock', 'defeat', 'Washington', 'early', 'battles', 'fall', 'Fort', 'William', 'Henry', 'massacre', 'William', 'Henry', 'lot', 'time', 'DVD', 'tries', 'downplay', 'whole', 'incident', 'stating', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'actually', 'killed', 'respect', 'number', 'reportedly', 'killed', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'devoted', 'certainly', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'movies', 'really', 'not', 'important', 'episode', 'entire', 'war', 'should', 'be', 'footnote.The', 'role', 'portrayal', 'Indians', 'almost', 'unbelievable', ""'happy"", 'Indian', 'idea', 'Dozens', 'Indian', 'nations', 'coexist', 'Eastern', 'North', 'America', 'mention', 'discord', 'various', 'tribes', 'Many', 'tribes', 'suffered', 'greatly', 'hands', 'Iroquois', 'wanted', 'throw', 'off', 'yoke', 'oppression', 'Tribes', 'sometimes', 'aligned', 'one', 'side', 'based', 'whom', 'enemies', 'sided', 'claim', 'almost', 'stupid', 'Captives', 'often', 'had', 'less', 'fear', 'thought', 'One', 'captive', 'shown', 'running', 'gauntlet', 'gauntlet', 'shown', 'being', 'very', 'kind', 'thing', 'Would', 'hazing', 'got', 'highschool', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'tame', 'claim', 'made', 'Indians', 'sided', 'French', 'French', 'were', 'less', 'likely', 'take', 'land', 'old', 'French', 'traders', 'vs.', 'English', 'settlers', 'idea', 'claim', 'later', 'contradicted', 'gifts', 'Indians', 'will', 'abandon', 'French', 'statement', 'really', 'Indians', 'look', 'mercenaries', 'who', 'sell', 'souls', 'few', 'trinkets', 'Unlikely', 'Indians', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'stupid', 'jumped', 'ship', 'English', 'started', 'winning', 'wanted', 'be', 'winning', 'side', 'final', 'claim', 'Indians', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'support', 'Indian', 'nations', 'necessary', 'ultimate', 'victory', 'simply', 'not', 'true', 'early', 'stages', 'war', 'betting', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'money', 'French', 'English', 'were', 'so', 'inept', 'imagination', 'However', '1759', 'English', 'had', 'shipped', 'largest', 'army', 'North', 'America', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'turned', 'European-style', 'war', ""'little"", 'war', 'small', 'bands', 'guided', 'Indian', 'scouts', 'allies', 'was', 'thing', 'past', 'frontier', 'was', 'simply', 'sideshow', 'big', 'battles', 'North', 'Quebec', 'real', 'nail', 'coffin', 'French', 'was', 'classic', 'European-style', 'battle', 'Indians', 'time', 'had', 'become', 'nearly', 'irrelevant', 'consider', 'treatment', 'English', 'war', 'led', 'Pontiac', 'Rebellion', 'West', 'was', 'nearly', 'forgotten', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'set', 'much', 'more', 'time', 'early', 'West', 'later', 'battles', 'North', 'only', 'nuisance', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'coverage.My', 'final', 'criticism', 'set', 'really', 'story', 'George', 'Washington', 'not', 'war', 'retelling', 'other', 'two', 'DVDs', 'mentioned', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'much', 'new.Well', 'there', 'anything', 'really', 'out', 'set', 'Yes', 'section', 'war', 'years', 'leading', 'up', 'Revolution', 'fantastic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'really', 'differences', 'goals', 'British', 'Americans', 'Americans', 'wanted', 'land', 'British', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'knew', 'what', 'wanted', 'Break', 'almost', 'inevitalbe', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'done.Is', 'set', 'worth', 'watching', 'Yes', 'just', 'keep', 'mind', 'bit', 'unbalanced', 'problems']",The War That Made America: The Story of the French and Indian War

965977,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B000E1MXZ0,Graves,"[3, 4]","To many modern Americans the ""French and Indian War"" is something they remembered from school happening before the Revolution or the subject of the occasional movie where redcoats are the good guys. In fact it was much more and this documentary tries to explain its importance in American history.To look at it is very good with fine attention to detail on uniform and items used. A great many re-enactors  showing the action make it easier to visualize men moving through woods than any number of sketches. Grahame Greene's well modulated voice is pleasant to listen to and works well.The documentary focuses heavily on the Indian experience, caught between the British and French. This is both its strength and weakness. On the plus side it goes into detail explaining the Indian motivations and outlook. It does not deny Indian atrocities, all too many Native apologists elsewhere deny there were ever any cases of scalping, but explains the context in which they took place.On the down side the focus so tightly on one peoples misses so much more in the war. We're half way through the series before it is remarked that this was a wider, world war with savage fighting taking place also in India and Europe as well of the woods of the north Eastern parts of North America. It also gives only passing reference to the corruption among French officials, some of who are believed to have wanted to lose to the British to cover their own misdeed, and gives very short shrift to the successful British commanders. Much is made of Braddock's inability to understand who to fight Indians but no mention is made that Wolfe, who took Quebec, who learned from Braddock, his standing orders for the campaign said that workmen were not to go unescorted into wooded areas, by comparison Braddock's standing orders said to pay no mind to sniper fire from the woods.  In all making the British seem just foils for the native and Colonial leader's acts. Wolfe's scaling the Heights of Abraham with an army in the middle of the night still stands as one of the greatest tactical actions of all time but you wouldn't know it from this. Likewise while much is made of the fact Washington was at Braddock's massacre and learned from this, nothing is said of the fact Braddock's vanguard was commanded by a British officer named Gage, who in 1775 would lead British troops  up a steep hill outside Boston in what would be called the battle of Bunker Hill.The war did not just set the stage for a revolution by raising issues of taxes and representation while removing the threat of French attack. What you see in writings of the men of the age is a starting recognition that the men in the colonies are no longer Englishmen. They are not yet Americans, but they are no longer Englishmen, they are becoming something else. This key point is badly missed.In the end for looking at the actions on the wooded frontiers and the actions and motivations of the various peoples involved locally in the fighting, this is a very good documentary. BUT with its tight focus on the Indians it misses its chance to be so much more and what, from its own copy, it wanted to be.",4,Great for focusing on the Indian frontier but badly misses wider issues,1368057600,"05 9, 2013",2013,3145,"['many', 'modern', 'Americans', 'French', 'Indian', 'War', 'something', 'remembered', 'school', 'happening', 'Revolution', 'subject', 'occasional', 'movie', 'where', 'redcoats', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'fact', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'documentary', 'tries', 'explain', 'importance', 'American', 'history.To', 'look', 'very', 'good', 'fine', 'attention', 'detail', 'uniform', 'items', 'used', 'great', 'many', 're-enactors', 'showing', 'action', 'make', 'easier', 'visualize', 'men', 'moving', 'woods', 'number', 'sketches', 'Grahame', 'Greene', 'well', 'modulated', 'voice', 'pleasant', 'listen', 'well.The', 'documentary', 'focuses', 'heavily', 'Indian', 'experience', 'caught', 'British', 'French', 'strength', 'weakness', 'plus', 'side', 'detail', 'explaining', 'Indian', 'motivations', 'outlook', 'not', 'deny', 'Indian', 'atrocities', 'too', 'many', 'Native', 'apologists', 'elsewhere', 'deny', 'were', 'ever', 'cases', 'scalping', 'context', 'took', 'place.On', 'down', 'side', 'focus', 'so', 'tightly', 'one', 'peoples', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'war', ""'re"", 'half', 'way', 'series', 'remarked', 'was', 'wider', 'world', 'war', 'savage', 'fighting', 'taking', 'place', 'also', 'India', 'Europe', 'as', 'well', 'woods', 'north', 'Eastern', 'parts', 'North', 'America', 'also', 'only', 'passing', 'reference', 'corruption', 'French', 'officials', 'who', 'are', 'believed', 'have', 'wanted', 'lose', 'British', 'cover', 'own', 'misdeed', 'very', 'short', 'shrift', 'successful', 'British', 'commanders', 'Much', 'made', 'Braddock', 'inability', 'understand', 'who', 'fight', 'Indians', 'mention', 'made', 'Wolfe', 'who', 'took', 'Quebec', 'who', 'learned', 'Braddock', 'standing', 'orders', 'campaign', 'said', 'workmen', 'were', 'not', 'go', 'unescorted', 'wooded', 'areas', 'comparison', 'Braddock', 'standing', 'orders', 'said', 'pay', 'mind', 'sniper', 'fire', 'woods', 'making', 'British', 'seem', 'just', 'foils', 'native', 'Colonial', 'leader', 'acts', 'Wolfe', 'scaling', 'Heights', 'Abraham', 'army', 'middle', 'night', 'still', 'one', 'greatest', 'tactical', 'actions', 'time', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'Likewise', 'much', 'made', 'fact', 'Washington', 'was', 'Braddock', 'massacre', 'learned', 'nothing', 'said', 'fact', 'Braddock', 'vanguard', 'was', 'commanded', 'British', 'officer', 'named', 'Gage', 'who', '1775', 'would', 'lead', 'British', 'troops', 'steep', 'hill', 'Boston', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'called', 'battle', 'Bunker', 'Hill.The', 'war', 'did', 'not', 'just', 'set', 'stage', 'revolution', 'raising', 'issues', 'taxes', 'representation', 'removing', 'threat', 'French', 'attack', 'What', 'see', 'writings', 'men', 'age', 'starting', 'recognition', 'men', 'colonies', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'Englishmen', 'are', 'not', 'yet', 'Americans', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'Englishmen', 'are', 'becoming', 'something', 'else', 'key', 'point', 'badly', 'end', 'looking', 'actions', 'wooded', 'frontiers', 'actions', 'motivations', 'various', 'peoples', 'involved', 'locally', 'fighting', 'very', 'good', 'documentary', 'BUT', 'tight', 'focus', 'Indians', 'chance', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'own', 'copy', 'wanted', 'be']",The War That Made America: The Story of the French and Indian War

965979,A1BO9C1WU478PN,B000E1MXZ0,Highlander,"[36, 79]","For all of the hoopla,this series was a disappointment.There were numerous examples to show that it was poorly researched.First of all,it states that William Pitt was the Prime Minister during the French & Indian War.In reality,he did not become the Prime Minister until 1766,way after the conclusion of F&I.Also,Indian captive James Smith was a woodcutter for the Braddock Expedition of 1755,and not a messenger when he was captured, as was told to the viewers.It also says that George Washington took command of the British forces after the defeat but this is a myth that ranks up there with the chopping down of the cherry tree or throwing a silver dollar across the Potomac River.GW was actually an unpaid volunteer for General Braddock since he resigned his commission in the Virginia Regiment after his defeat at Ft.Necessity in 1754.He wasn't in charge of anything then.When it mentions the Forbes Expedition to take Ft.Duquesne in 1758,it neglects to inform the viewers of the battles that took place along the way such as:Grant's Engagement and the French counterattack on Ft.Ligonier,as if they did not occur.Then,during Pontiac's War of 1763,this series leaves out the pivotal Battle of Bushy Run in Western Pennsylvania.It does cover the raid of the Paxton Boys in Eastern Pa.which is of little historical significance in the overall scheme of things.Much is made of the decree that small pox infected blankets be given to the Indians.Other than the isolated incident at Ft.Pitt,there is little evidence to suggest it was a wide spread or implemented policy.The Indians also dug up the bodies of Provincials at Ft.William Henry who succumbed to a small pox epidemic(including Robert Roger's brother).In that case it was the Native's own greed that spread the disease among their peoples yet the movie doesn't mention that at all.It is unclear as to wether this film is a movie or documentary.The main concept is to lead the viewer to believe that if not for an English victory,we'd all be speaking French today.In reality,the French did not intend to colonize North America,but rather utilize it for trade.Our ancestors would have probably settled somewhere else.In addition to the poor research,the battle scenes looked hokey in that actors and not reenactors were used.The battles scenes in ""The Chronicles of Narnia:The Lion,Witch and the Wardrobe"" looked more realistic.All of the soldiers were seen wearing wigs which wasn't the case,and definitely not on campaign.While the officers wore wigs,the enlisted men would have worn powder & grease in their hair until 1768.It is my understanding that F&I experts from Western Pa.were not used in this production,which explains its short comings.There are surely better movies on the French & Indian War out there than this one.I expect to eventually see this in the $4.99 DVD bin at WAL MART some day.",1,Simply Dreadful,1138233600,"01 26,

The actors/actresses in this film perform well and get the job done.Although the French are outnumbered by the British in that period, they allied with the Indians and defeated the British many times. The British first got the support from the colonists by treating them with respect. Then, they realized they need to respect these Indians as well and thus turned the tide of this war. Finally, the British won the war and the French were dispelled out of the North America. The British, however, didn't manage this territory well after winning the war. Their policy favored the Indians but didn't fit the interest of the colonists, which ultimately brought on the Revolution War.I think the chapters of the French and Indian War are well set in this film. I enjoy the whole watching very much. The impact to the Revolution War, however, seems not thorough enough for me. It's kind of rush, in my opinion. It would be good to have more discussions or deeper analysis for the linkage.This film is definitely a must-have for anyone having interest in the American history.

It is worthy of Ken Burns in how carefully it lays out the chronology and geography, and gives good maps to tie it all together.  They use realistic depictions of the period and authentic locations where possible, such as the Carlyle House in Alexandria, VA for example, in the actual room where Braddock did ask the colonists to contribute money for the war effort.  But the one thing they got really right is that they show that George Washington was in at the beginning to become the father of our country, in ways that could not have been foreseen at the time.  How many of you have been to Jumonville Glen?  I thought so.  You will have a hard time finding it on a map, but it is probably the most important location in American history.

However, I must say now that I was somewhat dissapointed.  On the positive side, I believe that overall this film did a fair job of explaining the main issues and describing the events of the so-called French and Indian war.  In particular, its emphasis on the Indians' point of view was somewhat new and interesting, although it certainly was at time over-emphasized. Also on the positive side, the blend of narrative and action scenes was well done and came accross somewhat better than many of these typical documentaries made up of ""experts"" interviews and picture stills (a la Ken Burns).  On the negative side, I share many of the criticisms of the scathing review by ""The Highlander"", although he too does not have all of his facts straight when he says for example that William Pitt (The Elder) was NOT the British Prime Minister durin the war, although he was, first from 1757 to 1761 and again from 1766 to 1768.  I agree that many of the battles did have a somewhat ""staged"" look.  Most of all I was very dissapointed and frustrated by how little importance was given to Forbes's successful campaign of 1758 against Fort Duquesne as compared to the earlier failures of 1754 by Washington and 1755 by Braddock.  In particular, I was somewhat incredulous that there was NO mention of Col. Henry Bouquet, the Swiss mercenary in the British service who was most responsible for Forbes' success.  Finally I could not believe the complete omission of the 1763 Battle of Bushy Run that started as a re-run of Braddock's defeat but ended up as the victory that decided the outcome of Pontiac's War thanks to the wiles of the same Col. Bouquet who certainly must rank as one of the most successful British commanders of this war.",3,"Interesting, but Uneven Film",1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,1886,"['many', 'western', 'Pennsylvania', 'history', 'buffs', 'had', 'been', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'much-heralded', 'PBS', 'program', 'was', 'produced', 'Pittsburgh', 'WQED', 'However', 'must', 'say', 'now', 'was', 'somewhat', 'dissapointed', 'positive', 'side', 'believe', 'overall', 'film', 'did', 'fair', 'job', 'explaining', 'main', 'issues', 'describing', 'events', 'so-called', 'French', 'Indian', 'war', 'particular', 'emphasis', 'Indians', 'point', 'view', 'was', 'somewhat', 'new', 'interesting', 'certainly', 'was', 'time', 'over-emphasized', 'Also', 'positive', 'side', 'blend', 'narrative', 'action', 'scenes', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'came', 'somewhat', 'better', 'many', 'typical', 'documentaries', 'made', 'experts', 'interviews', 'picture', 'stills', 'la', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'negative', 'side', 'share', 'many', 'criticisms', 'scathing', 'review', 'Highlander', 'too', 'not', 'have', 'facts', 'straight', 'when', 'example', 'William', 'Pitt', 'Elder', 'was', 'NOT', 'British', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'durin', 'war', 'was', 'first', '1757', '1761', 'again', '1766', '1768', 'agree', 'many', 'battles', 'did', 'have', 'somewhat', 'staged', 'look', 'Most', 'was', 'very', 'dissapointed', 'frustrated', 'how', 'little', 'importance', 'was', 'given', 'Forbes', 'successful', 'campaign', '1758', 'Fort', 'Duquesne', 'compared', 'earlier', 'failures', '1754', 'Washington', '1755', 'Braddock', 'particular', 'was', 'somewhat', 'incredulous', 'was', 'mention', 'Col.', 'Henry', 'Bouquet', 'Swiss', 'mercenary', 'British', 'service', 'who', 'was', 'most', 'responsible', 'Forbes', 'success', 'Finally', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'complete', 'omission', '1763', 'Battle', 'Bushy', 'Run', 'started', 're-run', 'Braddock', 'defeat', 'ended', 'up', 'victory', 'decided', 'outcome', 'Pontiac', 'War', 'thanks', 'wiles', 'same', 'Col', 'Bouquet', 'who', 'certainly', 'must', 'rank', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'British', 'commanders', 'war']",The War That Made America: The Story of the French and Indian War

Ommitting the reasons that though the Akadians were refusing to do business with the British they were supplying the French at Louisbourg and some were found under French arms.

It also has a number of Trival points, Mary Jemison was in her teens not thirty something as one critic pointed out to me.But overall it does good coverage.

965985,A1OCVWN4K4Q3FN,B000E1MXZ0,M. Keogh,"[82, 89]","""The War that Made America"" is an overview of most of the major events, and the people involved in them, of the French and Indian War.  It's sort of documentary/miniseries hybrid.  Like a documentary, it's narrated by an actor- Graham Greene, occasionally shows paintings and drawings from the era, and presents maps to highlight where the historical events took place.  However, unlike most documentaries, there are no historians discussing the subject or modern scenes of areas where the battles took place.  Instead, the film attempts to bring the main events of the war to life by ""re-enacting"" them through the use of actors.  I'm hestitant to use the word ""re-enactment"" to describe the live-action scenes because that conjures up images of middle-aged, overweight folks waddling about in period costumes and ""dying"" melodramatically for the camera.  The ""War that Made America,"" although obviously constrained by a low budget, appeared to have made attempts to to avoid the image of ""old guys playing army"" that unfortunately attaches to most documentaries that rely heavily on the services of amateur historical enthusiasts.  The live action scenes are fairly subdued and I didn't notice any 300lb fifty-year old privates or corporals.For its historical viewpoints, the documentary appears to have relied heavily upon the work of historian Fred Anderson- the author of the ""Crucible of War"" which is a terrific book on the Seven Years War.  Thus, just as Anderson portrayed in his book, the American Indian tribes are shown as serious political players in the struggle and not just peripheral allies as they are usually portrayed by other historians.  Further, since Anderson thinks that the guerilla warfare of expertise of American ranger outfits is nothing more than a myth, Robert Rogers and his rangers are not even mentioned which may surprise some people.  However, the film does avoid one of Anderson's more loopy beliefs- James Wolfe was suicidal and that battle of the Plains of Abraham was simply a way for him to kill himself.The documentary focuses on most of the famous events of the war- the attack on Jumonville's glen, the battles of Fort Necessity, Monogahela, the Bloody Morning Scout and Lake George, Fort William Henry, Ticonderoga, and the Plains of Abraham.  It also discusses the problems that the British high command had with the colonial assemblies (something Anderson focused heavily on in his book).  Near the end, it show some of the events of Pontiac's uprising.  Also, the film constantly reminds the viewer that the French and Indian War is crucial to understanding why the American Revolution occured.That link between the French and Indian War and the American Revolution is mostly demonstrated by the film's portrayal of the key role that young George Washington played in the F&I; war and how it shaped his development as a man and as a commander.  The role of George Washington is nicely played by Larry Nehring- a Cleveland stage actor who has Washington's imposing height and auburn hair. (Although he's a little too old to be playing a man who was just in early 20's when most of the events of the film take place.  The film also has an incredibly overaged ""Mary Jemison.)The film is fairly even handed.  It does not pretend that the Indians were not responsible for atrocities such as the Fort William Henry massacre or for what Shawnee raiders did to the Jemison family.  Thus, it's not as ""PC"" as some have complained here especially in light of the fact that there are ""historians"" out there who have attempted to whitewash every Indian atrocity.Overall, this was a very nicely done documentary on a fascinating subject.  Yes, it had a public TV documentary budget and looks it, but it does appear that the producers tried hard to make every cent count.  It provides a nice overview for people not really familiar with this period of history.

Much of it revolves around a young George Washington (though not all of it).It discusses the war from all 3 sides (French, English, and Indian), but it all relates back to the experiences which eventually formed the attitudes and political views of the Colonials (us).It takes us from major battle to battle.  It shows the disdain for the Native Americans both by British and by French commanders.  It also shows the disdain by the British for the Colonials.The series is woven throughout showing the causes and the consequences of decisions made by all parties to this war.",5,Well done video,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,643,"['2-disc', '4', 'part', 'PBS', 'series', 'French', 'Indian', 'war', 'Much', 'young', 'George', 'Washington', 'not', 'war', '3', 'sides', 'French', 'English', 'Indian', 'back', 'experiences', 'eventually', 'formed', 'attitudes', 'political', 'views', 'Colonials', '.It', 'major', 'battle', 'battle', 'disdain', 'Native', 'Americans', 'British', 'French', 'commanders', 'also', 'disdain', 'British', 'Colonials.The', 'series', 'woven', 'showing', 'causes', 'consequences', 'decisions', 'made', 'parties', 'war']",The War That Made America: The Story of the French and Indian War

The historical characters in this production actually speak,and for more than just a few sentences! The mix of reenactment, historical sites and 'talking head' narration, has been effectively done in other productions such as ""Liberty!"",""Franklin"" and ""John Adams"", but here, in contrast to those efforts, the major characters, Washington, Braddock, get a chance to speak at greater length, and not just reciting their correspondence. This makes the story more interesting and move along with much greater ease. The pacing is good; it seldom drags the way some history presentations do. The casting is good, the uniforms are adequate (buffs will spot some budget related errors)and the story gets the respect it deserves. Washington's role in starting the first 'world war' and its crucial contribution of experience to his role in the American Revolution, should be more widely known. This edition should help. We can only hope other historical subjects will get a similar treatment",5,Docudrama Finally Done Right,1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,1089,"['five', 'stars', 'are', 'reward', 'something', 'so', 'simple', 'wonder', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'more', 'often', 'historical', 'characters', 'production', 'actually', 'speak', 'more', 'just', 'few', 'sentences', 'mix', 'reenactment', 'historical', 'sites', ""'talking"", 'head', 'narration', 'been', 'effectively', 'done', 'other', 'productions', 'such', 'Liberty', 'Franklin', 'John', 'Adams', 'here', 'contrast', 'efforts', 'major', 'characters', 'Washington', 'Braddock', 'get', 'chance', 'speak', 'greater', 'length', 'not', 'just', 'reciting', 'correspondence', 'story', 'more', 'interesting', 'move', 'along', 'much', 'greater', 'ease', 'pacing', 'good', 'way', 'history', 'presentations', 'do', 'casting', 'good', 'uniforms', 'are', 'adequate', 'buffs', 'will', 'spot', 'budget', 'related', 'errors', 'story', 'respect', 'Washington', 'role', 'starting', 'first', ""'world"", 'war', 'crucial', 'contribution', 'experience', 'role', 'American', 'Revolution', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'widely', 'known', 'edition', 'should', 'help', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'other', 'historical', 'subjects', 'will', 'get', 'similar', 'treatment']",The War That Made America: The Story of the French and Indian War
