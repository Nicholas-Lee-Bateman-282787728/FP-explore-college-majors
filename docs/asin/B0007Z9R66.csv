It was fun to see how the young stars of the first film have grown up, though not quite a shock with Kimberly J. Brown. I've been a fan of hers for years. But onto the review. HH is an awesome movie, though I wish that they would've actually gone to Halloweentown in it. It was fun seeing Marnie in school. The problems that she faced trying to keep her friends from finding out about her and her friends from Halloweentown were hilarious. Marnie's powers are tremendously more advanced in Halloweentown High than they were in the other two movies, though her spells don't always have the desired effect most of the time. She tries to make a magical set of rooms in her house but ends up shrinking the house instead. A skeleton is attacking someone and Marnie tries the spell that her grandmother uses to make something go away but ends up only making the skeleton several times larger. There were only two things that I didn't like about the movie. One, there was no commentary track by the cast, and two, the audio is 5.1 surround sound. If you don't have a surround sound system, the sound will be compressed which can make the volume get a bit softer in places. I don't have a 5.1 system yet, but I'm hoping. If you're any kind of fan of Halloween or Kimberly J.

896540,A251MRI34QYHH2,B0007Z9R66,Suzanne Estrada,"[0, 0]","I personally am a Halloweentown fan and love all of the movies. I loved Halloweentown and the sequel a lot. I actually liked Halloweentown better than the sequel as Kal casts the grey spell and turns everything of halloweentown and everyone grey and boring and Aggy and Marni try to stop it. My favorite part was when, they defeated Kal and they could open the portal and get back into the mortal world. A great ending.Then there's halloweentown II. I found that it wasn't as great as Halloweentown, but I loved it. I like it 'cause it's not too scary that you're tempted to turn it off. It contains some scariness, magic use, comedy and fun activity! Both Halloweentown and the sequel contained these features.Next comes Halloweentown High. Marni moves on to High School, as well as her brother. Aggy then brings some halloweentown creatures to the Highschool in the mortal world. I like this movie 99 percent, Halloweentown II, 100 percent, Halloweentown, 110 percent. I will say, Halloweentown 1 and 2 pretty much stole it! Halloweentown High had great features, but it wasn't as warm, sweet and as much of a good story as the first 2 movies had. Still, I was very proud with it and enjoy it very, very, very much. But Halloweentown 1 and 2 still were by 3-4 percent better.Also there's Return to Halloweentown without Kimberly J. Brown - but with Sara Paxton, the great actress.This movie was actually my third favorite of the four halloweentown movies. Halloweentown 1, 2 and Return to Halloweentown are my three favorites. Halloweentown 1 goes in first place, the sequel goes in second place, and Return to Halloweentown is in third. Halloweentown High is in fourth.The reason why I like Return to Halloweentown so much is because, Marni is now moving on to College and learning more, facing more and it's getting even more challenging. She tries her hardest to face them by getting the powerful necklace from her Grandma when she was her age (or older) when she goes back in time in Halloweentown. In the end, the awful spell that was casted - was now un-casted and it sailed right into a very happy ending.A lot of scary, funny, magic, thrilling things throughout the whole entire movie. Great for family halloween parties or events/get-togethers as a nice movie with popcorn, leftover candy from Trick-or-Treating and apple cider.All four of the Halloweentown movies have thrilled me so much. I keep watching them over and over. They are so fun to watch on halloween or any time! It is the best Disney Halloween movie ever made! I encourage you SO MUCH to buy every one of the Halloweentown movies. You'll never get tired of these halloween-favorites!",5,AMAZING! GREAT! AWESOME!

896541,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0007Z9R66,Tim Janson,"[3, 6]","Halloweentown High is the third in the trilogy of Halloweentown films that began in 1998.  All of the main characters from the first two years are back including Debbie Reynolds as Aggie Cromwell and Judith Hoag as the mom and reluctant witch.  It's six years later and Marnie Piper(Kimberly Brown) is now pretty well grown up and now in high school and has become a very skilled witch.  Marnie and her grandmother Aggie bring several young teens from Halloweentown to the mortal world and disguise them as everyday teens so they can attend school and learn about the mortal world.  But a new villain is not happy about this plan and does everything he can to foul up the plan.As with the first two films the affects are very good for a TV movie.  Marnie really takes center stage in this movie at the expense of both Reynolds and Hoag.  This hurts the film because the great thing about the first two was how the whole family was working together to battle the villain.  Add to that a bit too much time is spent on Marnie's love interest and also that the Halloween ""feel"" isn't as strong as in the first two.  It's not a bad film, but certainly not as good as the others.",3,Not as Good as the First Two,1126742400,"09 15, 2005",2005,1173,"['Halloweentown', 'High', 'third', 'trilogy', 'Halloweentown', 'films', 'began', '1998', 'main', 'characters', 'first', 'two', 'years', 'are', 'back', 'including', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'Aggie', 'Cromwell', 'Judith', 'Hoag', 'mom', 'reluctant', 'witch', 'six', 'years', 'later', 'Marnie', 'Piper', 'Kimberly', 'Brown', 'now', 'pretty', 'well', 'grown', 'up', 'now', 'high', 'school', 'become', 'very', 'skilled', 'witch', 'Marnie', 'grandmother', 'Aggie', 'bring', 'several', 'young', 'teens', 'Halloweentown', 'mortal', 'world', 'disguise', 'everyday', 'teens', 'can', 'attend', 'school', 'learn', 'mortal', 'world', 'new', 'villain', 'not', 'happy', 'plan', 'everything', 'can', 'foul', 'up', 'plan.As', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'affects', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'TV', 'movie', 'Marnie', 'really', 'center', 'stage', 'movie', 'expense', 'Reynolds', 'Hoag', 'film', 'great', 'thing', 'first', 'two', 'was', 'how', 'whole', 'family', 'was', 'working', 'together', 'battle', 'villain', 'Add', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'Marnie', 'love', 'interest', 'also', 'Halloween', 'feel', ""n't"", 'as', 'strong', 'first', 'two', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'others']",Halloweentown High

In this installment, it has been three years since the events in Kalabar's Revenge aka Halloweentown II. Marnie is now in high school and proposes that some of the teen inhabitants of Halloweentown be allowed to attend Marnie's high school in the mortal world as a way of promoting friendship between the mortal world and Halloweentown. The Witches' Council which Marnie approaches with her idea is initially reluctant to give their consent because the members are fearful as to what might happen should the Knights of the Iron Dagger find out. The Knights are devoted to destroying all things magical. Unfortunately, the stakes are high as Marnie bets all her Cromwell magic that things will work out. Trouble is, if things turn sour by Halloween Eve, then Marnie and her entire family stand to lose their magical powers.This third installment is just as fun as the other two in the series. Marnie's grandmother Aggie (the delightful Debbie Reynolds) is a hoot and gets into some funny situations at Marnie's school where Aggie takes up a substitute position teaching Science. The Halloweentown students are disguised as humans so that they don't scare off the humans, and there's even a love interest storyline featuring Marnie's budding romance with Cody. All in all this movie is great fun for the entire family and is one of those Halloween movies which is kid-friendly (I'd say seven and up if only so that the child will be able to follow the storyline and not be afraid of the weird make-up and stuff).",5,Fun sequel to Halloweentown I & II,1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,1653,"['Halloweentown', 'High', 'last', 'series', 'sequel', 'following', 'feature', 'Kimberly', 'J', 'Brown', 'Marnie', 'teen', 'witch', 'installment', 'been', 'three', 'years', 'events', 'Kalabar', 'Revenge', 'aka', 'Halloweentown', 'II', 'Marnie', 'now', 'high', 'school', 'teen', 'inhabitants', 'Halloweentown', 'be', 'allowed', 'attend', 'Marnie', 'high', 'school', 'mortal', 'world', 'way', 'promoting', 'friendship', 'mortal', 'world', 'Halloweentown', 'Witches', 'Council', 'Marnie', 'idea', 'initially', 'reluctant', 'give', 'consent', 'members', 'are', 'fearful', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'should', 'Knights', 'Iron', 'Dagger', 'find', 'out', 'Knights', 'are', 'devoted', 'destroying', 'things', 'magical', 'Unfortunately', 'stakes', 'are', 'high', 'Marnie', 'Cromwell', 'magic', 'things', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'Trouble', 'things', 'turn', 'sour', 'Halloween', 'Eve', 'then', 'Marnie', 'entire', 'family', 'stand', 'lose', 'magical', 'powers.This', 'third', 'installment', 'just', 'as', 'fun', 'other', 'two', 'series', 'Marnie', 'grandmother', 'Aggie', 'delightful', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'hoot', 'funny', 'situations', 'Marnie', 'school', 'where', 'Aggie', 'up', 'substitute', 'position', 'teaching', 'Science', 'Halloweentown', 'students', 'are', 'disguised', 'humans', 'do', ""n't"", 'scare', 'off', 'humans', 'even', 'love', 'interest', 'storyline', 'featuring', 'Marnie', 'budding', 'romance', 'Cody', 'movie', 'great', 'fun', 'entire', 'family', 'one', 'Halloween', 'movies', 'kid-friendly', ""'d"", 'say', 'seven', 'up', 'only', 'so', 'child', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'storyline', 'not', 'be', 'afraid', 'weird', 'make-up', 'stuff']",Halloweentown High
