202117,A8AD6PLQ0PPQE,630018269X,"Anonymous ""booksandcookies""","[5, 5]","This film is based on the book of the same name by Olive Frederickson about her experiences as a young woman in the remote wilderness of northwest Canada with her ""roamer-dreamer"" husband and the tremendous challenges and traumas they face in a fierce environment. Olive's story continues through various life changes which she faces with courage and independence and grit. This is an intense, captivating story of love, persistence, courage and adventure and one that families with children of, perhaps, middle-school age and up could watch together.Another reviewer says that John Heard is in this movie, but he is not. The main characters are played by Ellen Burstyn, Tom Skeritt and John Pinsent (who is now well known for his recurring role in The Red-Green Show).I had searched in vain for years and years - since seeing this film in the theater when it came out - for this as a rental or for sale. Early versions were about $75.00! It is a marvelous story and well worth seeing and then watching over again.",5,Excellent and True,1167523200,"12 31, 2006",2006,1014,"['film', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Olive', 'Frederickson', 'experiences', 'young', 'woman', 'remote', 'wilderness', 'northwest', 'Canada', 'roamer-dreamer', 'husband', 'tremendous', 'challenges', 'traumas', 'face', 'fierce', 'environment', 'Olive', 'story', 'various', 'life', 'changes', 'courage', 'independence', 'grit', 'intense', 'captivating', 'story', 'love', 'persistence', 'courage', 'adventure', 'one', 'families', 'children', 'perhaps', 'middle-school', 'age', 'up', 'could', 'watch', 'together.Another', 'reviewer', 'John', 'Heard', 'movie', 'not', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Tom', 'Skeritt', 'John', 'Pinsent', 'who', 'now', 'well', 'known', 'recurring', 'role', 'Red-Green', 'Show', '.I', 'had', 'searched', 'vain', 'years', 'years', 'seeing', 'film', 'theater', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'rental', 'sale', 'Early', 'versions', 'were', 'about', '75.00', 'marvelous', 'story', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'then', 'watching', 'over', 'again']",N/A
202118,AVAOW37WXKITN,630018269X,Dick Mann,"[5, 5]","It was good to see favorite stars when they were younger and see why they were stars.  Good acting by most adults but I thought the daughters were a little stiff.  Olive, Ellen Burstyn, was a sensitive but adventurous woman who defied her father to marry a dreamer and wanderer Walter Reamer, Tom Skerrit, who was stricken with wanderlust.  Her story is similar to many of the pioneer women in Canada and in the U.S. from colonial days to the old west, who braved all kinds of hardships to make a living away from civilization.  I would reccomend this to families with children to share with them that we haven't always lived in comfortable homes and it took sacrifice to make it this way.  This review is based on a used VHS purchased from a thrift store.",5,Excellent Frontier Movie,1162080000,"10 29, 2006",2006,756,"['was', 'good', 'see', 'favorite', 'stars', 'when', 'were', 'younger', 'see', 'why', 'were', 'stars', 'Good', 'acting', 'most', 'adults', 'thought', 'daughters', 'were', 'little', 'stiff', 'Olive', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'was', 'sensitive', 'adventurous', 'woman', 'who', 'defied', 'father', 'marry', 'dreamer', 'wanderer', 'Walter', 'Reamer', 'Tom', 'Skerrit', 'who', 'was', 'stricken', 'wanderlust', 'story', 'similar', 'many', 'pioneer', 'women', 'Canada', 'U.S.', 'colonial', 'days', 'old', 'west', 'who', 'braved', 'kinds', 'hardships', 'make', 'living', 'away', 'civilization', 'would', 'reccomend', 'families', 'children', 'share', 'have', ""n't"", 'always', 'lived', 'comfortable', 'homes', 'took', 'sacrifice', 'make', 'way', 'review', 'based', 'used', 'VHS', 'purchased', 'thrift', 'store']",N/A

It is also an excellent movie with Ellen Burstyn giving a great performance.  I first saw it on HBO, but have not seen it anywhere else.  I had to include it in my collection.

Tom Skeritt and his new bride (Burstyn) leave civilization for Alaska unskilled and woefully ill-prepared for the life threatening existence their new world has in store for them. When all seems to be lost, Heard, stable and mature, helps salvage the day.
