1069845,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000PC704M,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","Barbaro was a courageous horse.  He was a champion right from the beginning of his birth, and all the owners knew it.  He had that special winning vibe and appearance that people knew would make him a legendary horse, and a Kentucky Derby winner.I want to say something else.  People always talk about Barbaro having the opportunity to be the first triple crown winner in 20-something years, but not being able to accomplish that because of his unfortunate leg injury.Let me tell you something- more people are aware of the Kentucky Derby, which Barbaro won, and to me, that's more important than some extraordinary triple crown achievement.  It was wrong for my local news to put most of their attention on the triple crown aspect of Barbaro in the horse racing event, instead of the fact he won a really good race in the Kentucky Derby.  THAT is what we will remember Barbaro for, and we'll also remember him for his amazing ability to run past all the other horses on the track without breaking a sweat.  A truly talented animal.What proved he was unlike other horses was when he realized he was injured, and instead of jumping around and being hard to control (like other horses) he just stood perfectly still and let the doctors examine his injured body.  Barbaro was almost human the way he acted.Get this DVD to see what the big deal was about with this amazing horse.",5,the nations horse,1211587200,"05 24, 2008",2008,1375,"['Barbaro', 'was', 'courageous', 'horse', 'was', 'champion', 'right', 'beginning', 'birth', 'owners', 'knew', 'had', 'special', 'winning', 'vibe', 'appearance', 'people', 'knew', 'would', 'make', 'legendary', 'horse', 'Kentucky', 'Derby', 'winner.I', 'want', 'say', 'something', 'else', 'People', 'always', 'talk', 'Barbaro', 'having', 'opportunity', 'be', 'first', 'triple', 'crown', 'winner', '20-something', 'years', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'accomplish', 'unfortunate', 'leg', 'injury.Let', 'tell', 'something-', 'more', 'people', 'are', 'aware', 'Kentucky', 'Derby', 'Barbaro', 'won', 'more', 'important', 'extraordinary', 'triple', 'crown', 'achievement', 'was', 'wrong', 'local', 'news', 'put', 'most', 'attention', 'triple', 'crown', 'aspect', 'Barbaro', 'horse', 'racing', 'event', 'instead', 'fact', 'won', 'really', 'good', 'race', 'Kentucky', 'Derby', 'what', 'will', 'remember', 'Barbaro', ""'ll"", 'also', 'remember', 'amazing', 'ability', 'run', 'past', 'other', 'horses', 'track', 'breaking', 'sweat', 'truly', 'talented', 'animal.What', 'proved', 'was', 'other', 'horses', 'was', 'when', 'realized', 'was', 'injured', 'instead', 'jumping', 'around', 'being', 'hard', 'control', 'other', 'horses', 'just', 'stood', 'perfectly', 'still', 'let', 'doctors', 'examine', 'injured', 'body', 'Barbaro', 'was', 'almost', 'human', 'way', 'DVD', 'see', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'was', 'about', 'amazing', 'horse']",Barbaro - A Nation's Horse

The documentary is split into seven sections and has bonus footage. It features full coverage of the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes & Barbaro's five races that sparked his run for Triple Crown immortality.The interviews are with the individuals who are most associated with the champion; trainer Michael Matz, jockey Edgar Prado, owners Roy and Gretchen Jackson and veterinarian Dr. Dean Richardson.The nearly 13 minutes that closes the documentary - The Recovery and Barbaro's Legacy - clearly demonstrates why this story will continue to resonate amongst people who hardly follow Thoroughbred racing. The inclusion of letters to Barbaro is especially touching.This is a wonderful tribute.

The one I saw originally was much longer and went into much more detail.  I specifically remember seeing a scene where Barbaro's jockey was describing his last stretch of the Derby, and the line he said, ""OK,""les"" go!"" was not in this one!  I LOVED watching that one particular scene because Barbaro HAULED ASS!  It was simply magnificent to watch.Several scene I remember from the first DVD were shortened or completely missing: the winner's circle celebration was much shorter, Barbaro's transit from the track to the hospital much shorter, the treatment at the hospital was not as detailed because I remember Barbaro being placed in a sling to get him into the whirlpool was not as detailed.I suggest you skip this edition and try to find the COMPLETE edition with all the uncut scenes.

1069849,A38467NO4F89I2,B000PC704M,Fascination with Fear,"[43, 45]","This is the first of two documentaries (the second is to air on HBO in June) that tells the bittersweet story of a horse that captured the heart of a nation last year. Even the casual ""once or twice a year"" horseracing fan has to admit that the story surrounding the 2006 Kentucky Derby winner tugs at the heartstrings.We were astounded by his brilliant Derby, devastated by his subsequent Preakness nightmare, amazed by his sheer will to live, and lastly, heartbroken by the news of his death. The world rallied behind this champion the entire summer and fall and into the winter, and this is the story of those events.It starts at the end, really - beginning with the day owners Roy & Gretchen Jackson and Barbaro's surgeon, Dr. Dean Richardson, explained why they couldn't go on, and the decision to euthanize was made. The story then goes into detail about the events that came together - the trainer's brush with death in a plane crash and the heroics surrounding it, his Olympic glory, the owners and the story behind Barbaro's name, the birth of Barbaro and his astounding feats on both turf and dirt leading up to the Ky Derby, and his unfortunate mistep in the Preakness Stakes.It then switches gears to the story of his gallant battle to beat the odds - his lifesaving surgery and healing, the table-turning laminitis, and his deceiving progress which in turn ended up meaning the loss of one of the best horses the world has seen in nearly 30 years.It brings back all the emotions of joy and fear, hope and sadness - that horseracing is so full of. Barbaro's courage and will to live captivated the world, and not just the horseracing community. It serves to remind us that fame is fleeting, horseracing is full of the highest highs and the lowest lows, and as Gretchen Jackson so rightly said- with love comes grief.  But when you have a horse so beloved as Barbaro, it is worth it.  So is this DVD.If you are an avid horseracing fanatic, it will bring tears to your eyes, again.  If you are just a casual follower or fan, it still will.
