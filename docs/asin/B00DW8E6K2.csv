1662159,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B00DW8E6K2,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[70, 77]","Series 10 of New Tricks saw a sea change in this very successful and long running show which debuted as long ago as 2003 and has now run to 87 episodes. By the end of the series the only member of the original team still in UCOS was Jerry Standing (Dennis Waterman). Following the departure of Jack Halford (James Bolam) at the beginning of the last series, it was time to bid a fond farewell to both Brian Lane (Alun Armstrong) and DS Sandra Pulman (Amanda Redman), Brian fairly early on in the series and Sandra in Episode 8.The cases this time round were quite varied. We start off with a two part story set in Gibralter, which is unusual for New Tricks which has rarely strayed far from its London home in the past. This was a puzzling cold case in which two killings separated by sixteen years were apparently linked. Brian had been getting himself into trouble and there are signs that his days in UCOS were numbered. The change of scenery seemed to suit the team who seemed to excel with the more exotic surroundings. However, the rest of the episodes were back in London, and I would say the stories were a lot more interesting and coherent than, perhaps those in Series 9 when apparently the cast took it on themselves to rewrite some of the scripts!So how did the new boys and girl get on? Steve McAndrew (Denis Lawson), Jack Halford's replacement, seems to have really settled in with the team now and appears comfortable in the role. However, I was particularly impressed with Dan Griffin, Brian's replacement, played by Nicholas Lyndhurst who is probably best known for his role in Only Fools and Horses. From his appearance in Episode 5, when the team are investigating a murder case from 1980's Soho, he seemed to be a natural for UCOS. This was an inspired piece of casting. The final new boy (or rather girl) was Detective Chief Inspector Sasha Miller played by Tamzin Outhwaite who only had two episodes to make an impact, which she certainly did on the team who were initially very suspicious about this change. However, in many ways she seems like a younger version of Sandra Pulman and even sounds very similar so this is, perhaps, not such a dramatic change.I would agree with those who have said that it would be good to have more of the personal lives of the participants as there was in earlier series. However, I would say the signs in this respect are good with glimpses of Steve McAndrew's and Dan Griffin's personal life, quite a lot on Brian Lane in the earlier episodes and some pretty dramatic personal developments for Sasha Miller from the word go. Lets hope to see more of this aspect in the future.So overall this was a good solid series of 10 episodes which will please most viewers. It is not certain where we go from here, and although a new team is in place alongside Jerry Standing, I have not heard that an eleventh series has been announced yet. When it became clear that most of the original actors were leaving I did wonder what the future would hold. However, after this series I see no reason why the show should not continue along the same lines with the new cast, particularly given that the viewing figures for this season remained very strong. It will certainly be different and with the established players leaving it is the end of an era, but there is no reason why the new format should not be equally entertaining.",5,All Change At New Tricks,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,3369,"['Series', '10', 'New', 'Tricks', 'saw', 'sea', 'change', 'very', 'successful', 'long', 'running', 'show', 'debuted', 'long', 'ago', '2003', 'now', 'run', '87', 'episodes', 'end', 'series', 'only', 'member', 'original', 'team', 'still', 'UCOS', 'was', 'Jerry', 'Standing', 'Dennis', 'Waterman', 'Following', 'departure', 'Jack', 'Halford', 'James', 'Bolam', 'beginning', 'last', 'series', 'was', 'time', 'bid', 'fond', 'farewell', 'Brian', 'Lane', 'Alun', 'Armstrong', 'DS', 'Sandra', 'Pulman', 'Amanda', 'Redman', 'Brian', 'fairly', 'early', 'series', 'Sandra', 'Episode', '8.The', 'cases', 'time', 'round', 'were', 'quite', 'varied', 'start', 'off', 'two', 'part', 'story', 'set', 'Gibralter', 'unusual', 'New', 'Tricks', 'rarely', 'strayed', 'far', 'London', 'home', 'past', 'was', 'puzzling', 'cold', 'case', 'two', 'killings', 'separated', 'sixteen', 'years', 'were', 'apparently', 'linked', 'Brian', 'had', 'been', 'getting', 'trouble', 'are', 'signs', 'days', 'UCOS', 'were', 'numbered', 'change', 'scenery', 'seemed', 'suit', 'team', 'who', 'seemed', 'excel', 'more', 'exotic', 'surroundings', 'However', 'rest', 'episodes', 'were', 'back', 'London', 'would', 'say', 'stories', 'were', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'coherent', 'perhaps', 'Series', '9', 'when', 'apparently', 'cast', 'took', 'rewrite', 'scripts', 'how', 'did', 'new', 'boys', 'girl', 'get', 'Steve', 'McAndrew', 'Denis', 'Lawson', 'Jack', 'Halford', 'replacement', 'have', 'really', 'settled', 'team', 'now', 'comfortable', 'role', 'However', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'Dan', 'Griffin', 'Brian', 'replacement', 'played', 'Nicholas', 'Lyndhurst', 'who', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'role', 'Only', 'Fools', 'Horses', 'appearance', 'Episode', '5', 'when', 'team', 'are', 'investigating', 'murder', 'case', '1980', 'Soho', 'seemed', 'be', 'natural', 'UCOS', 'was', 'inspired', 'piece', 'casting', 'final', 'new', 'boy', 'rather', 'girl', 'was', 'Detective', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Sasha', 'Miller', 'played', 'Tamzin', 'Outhwaite', 'who', 'only', 'had', 'two', 'episodes', 'make', 'impact', 'certainly', 'did', 'team', 'who', 'were', 'initially', 'very', 'suspicious', 'change', 'However', 'many', 'ways', 'younger', 'version', 'Sandra', 'Pulman', 'even', 'very', 'similar', 'perhaps', 'not', 'dramatic', 'change.I', 'would', 'agree', 'who', 'have', 'said', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'have', 'more', 'personal', 'lives', 'participants', 'was', 'earlier', 'series', 'However', 'would', 'say', 'signs', 'respect', 'are', 'good', 'glimpses', 'Steve', 'McAndrew', 'Dan', 'Griffin', 'personal', 'life', 'quite', 'lot', 'Brian', 'Lane', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'pretty', 'dramatic', 'personal', 'developments', 'Sasha', 'Miller', 'word', 'go', 'Lets', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'aspect', 'future.So', 'overall', 'was', 'good', 'solid', 'series', '10', 'episodes', 'will', 'please', 'most', 'viewers', 'not', 'certain', 'where', 'go', 'here', 'new', 'team', 'place', 'alongside', 'Jerry', 'Standing', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'eleventh', 'series', 'been', 'announced', 'yet', 'When', 'became', 'clear', 'most', 'original', 'actors', 'were', 'leaving', 'did', 'wonder', 'what', 'future', 'would', 'hold', 'However', 'series', 'see', 'reason', 'why', 'show', 'should', 'not', 'continue', 'same', 'lines', 'new', 'cast', 'particularly', 'given', 'viewing', 'figures', 'season', 'remained', 'very', 'strong', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'different', 'established', 'players', 'leaving', 'end', 'era', 'reason', 'why', 'new', 'format', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'equally', 'entertaining']",New Tricks: Complete BBC Series 10 anglais

1662171,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B00DW8E6K2,Jon Wynne,"[2, 2]","It is no secret that further changes were in store for NEW TRICKS after the departure of James Bolam, one of the original four leads, back at the end of Season Eight. Anticipating these changes has been fun, though some people have had reservations.With the release of NEW TRICKS Season 10 in North America from Acorn (that purveyor of so many classy British and Commonwealth-produced programs) fans of the series outside of the United Kingdom can now decide for themselves how well the transitions work.Inevitably there will remain some trepidation on the part of many viewers, wondering if the show will, in the long run, be ruined by these changes. From the perspective of this reviewer, those concerns are, for the most part, dispelled after watching all ten of the new, excellent episodes of this beloved series. True, one cannot help but miss Alun Armstrong's brilliant portrayal of troubled Brian Lane (not to mention Susan Jamieson's manifestation of Brian's long-suffering wife, Esther). But their send-off episode (number four in this set) is extremely satisfying. It even leaves the door open to a possible spin-off series featuring the two retirees as independent detectives!Equally well written and executed is the eighth episode, when Amanda Redman moves on (the details of which will not be revealed here). In short, it all works. In the excellent bonus features the stars talk candidly about the changes, including their mixed emotions about leaving the show: namely sadness and excitement at the prospect of playing other roles, roles they would otherwise not be able to take on given their six month per year commitment to filming NEW TRICKS.So what about the new kids on the block? By now, viewers will have become accustomed to Denis Lawson as Steve McAndrew, who replaced the irascible James Bolam. The trickier transition is Nicholas Lyndhurst replacing Alun Armstrong. Lyndhurst is your typical British character actor: versatile, professional and reliable. Possessed of ordinary looks, with close set eyes that make him look as if he is always thinking, processing information (much like Armstrong's Brian), Lyndhurst brings a more serious touch to the UCOS team, which balances beautifully with the more energetic Denis Lawson and the ever volatile Dennis Waterman. Lyndhurst's at times almost sad demeanour makes him less accessible than the others, but as the episodes go by he draws the viewer in with his understated line delivery and somewhat quirky obsession with little-known facts that in the end often make a valuable contribution to the group's crime solving efforts. He also has a wife in a high security mental institution (whom we have not yet seen) and a daughter at home with cerebral palsy (played by Storme Toolis, one of the few working actors in the U.K. who really does have a disability--in addition to her real-life cerebral palsy, she also uses a wheelchair). By the end of Series 10 we know enough about Lyndhurst's Danny Griffin that we want to know more, which in short means we have accepted him as part of the team.A little harder to accept, at least so far, is Tamzin Outhwaite as DCI Sasha Miller, Sandra's replacement. Of course, how can you ""replace"" Amanda Redman? You can't. Ms Outhwaite has big high heels to fill. But given some time to adapt--since she only appears in the last two episodes of Season 10--I suspect she'll do just fine. If you really think about it, there SHOULD be some awkwardness about this fundamental change to the team's (and the show's) chemistry. This is simply the way it is in real life when a beloved person leaves a close-knit collaboration. Why shouldn't the series reflect this?To her credit, DCI Miller does not come in and try to rock the boat. She is less of a dynamo than Sandra was and more of an observer at first. When we realize her caution masks a competency that shows her to be worthy of her new promotion, which had, in turn, led to her becoming the new leader of UCOS, it becomes apparent that perhaps her initial reticence was a tad deceptive. I'm sure once Ms Outhwaite has Season 11 under her belt and we've come to know her better, all will be well.After all, everything is in a state of flux, so why not NEW TRICKS? There's plenty of life left in this outstanding show. The writing is still sharp and the production values high. Trying to guess the circumstances under which both Brian Lane and Sandra Pullman transition on to other things isn't easy. In fact, there are some genuine surprises in Season 10, including the first ever NEW TRICKS two-part storyline, set on Gibraltar, which starts things off with an exotic touch.

1662192,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00DW8E6K2,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[3, 4]","After a few thousand reviews that I've posted on Amazon this may be one of the hardest for me to write.  ""New Tricks"" is a detective/mystery series and - if you've read my other reviews - you'll know that I do not like ""spoilers"" (nor do I read reviews with ""spoilers"") because I think it is unfair. So you won't read ""spoilers"" here if I can help it. And - in this case it's not easy. But on with my review:First off, if you've come to this review of the 10th series of ""New Tricks"", I don't think I need to describe the series as you have, hopefully, like me, watched - and enjoyed - the previous nine seasons. IF NOT, skip this, and all the other reviews on this listing and go back and buy Season One and start at the beginning. This is a ""character driven"" series and you need to watch it from the beginning. And - trust me - this ranks (with ""Miss Fisher's Mysteries"") among the top British DVD series of all time.So, if you are with me this far I'll give you some info on Season 10. There are many ""changes"" this season and I guess I can't hide the fact that two of the original actors, who have been with the series since the beginning will depart this season, but when and how you will need to see for yourself. And you might even see one of the previously ""departed"" members return. The producers and writers have used these changes to go back in the personal history of the cast to bring up old memories and tie up some loose ends. After the first few seasons you have probably noticed that it not the cases that the UCOS are given to solve are not the reason to watch. It's the personal lives of each of the ""team"" - and the brilliant acting by each of them - that keep you coming back. And, in this season, the cases are both weird and often confusing but that's beside the point. Brian, Jerry, Sandra and Danny are like old friends and you care for what happens to them. THAT is the reason I can say that - while not up to early seasons, you need to see this season too. There are other ""changes"" as well. The first two episodes are a two-part story (the series' first) and so you should watch them together. And for the first time in my memory, the episodes do not end with Dennis Waterman (Jerry Standling) singing the upbeat ""It's Alright"". And the episodes are darker. But, after all, we care about these characters.The DVD set contains two ""bonus features"", both of which contain ""spoilers""- so save watching them until you've watched all 10 episodes. The first tells about the filming of the two-part episode filmed in Gibraltar (10 min) and the other is a ""behind the scenes"" featurette which includes scenes from past seasons as well as this one. It runs 14 minutes and gives you a chance to see that the actors are not that different in voice and demeanor than they are in their roles.So, I can't give this season a true five stars- as that would put it on the par with the earlier seasons which had more interesting - and better crafted - cases. Maybe it's a 4.5 rating. But I'll round it up and just hope that the narrative above will guide you. From what I can see by scanning the titles of other reviews - most of them are based on Amazon Instant streams or on the earlier UK release. The DVD set will be released on June 3rd. (I received an advance review screener from RLJ, the distribution company).I should also point out that the DVD contains the 58-minute original UK versions of the episodes. The show was broadcast on PBS but I'm guessing it was ""edited"" version. The DVD does include graphic violence and strong language is used, including the ""S"" word. This won't affect most people but it is not ""G"" rated for family viewing.I hope that this review was both informative and helpful, without providing info which will decrease your enjoyment of watching the 10th season.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,"Ch-h-h-anges!
