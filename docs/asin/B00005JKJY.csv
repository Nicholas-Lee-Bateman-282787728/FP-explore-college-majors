They created an interesting and very charasmatic character called Van Wilder.  A man who has been in college for most of a decade achieving legendary status, but no degree.  He handles school like a politician, active in most facets, sports, art, social events, and renowned for his parties.  But for some reason is afraid to graduate.His character is what really drived the movie.  He is funny without being mean, intruguing without being far fetched, and interesting to watch.  The humor is all over the place, puns, word plays, situational, crude, as well as deadpan.  But most importantly it creates a character that you not only laugh at and with, but actually care about.

It&#65533;s defiantly different and unique. Ryan Reynolds is simply amazing. I don&#65533;t think I&#65533;ve seen any other of his movies, except for the small part in Dick.Without Kal Penn, as Taj, Van Wilder would&#65533;ve been nothing. Foreign exchange students always make all the difference. Daniel Cosgrove as Richard, who also plays Bill on Guiding Light impressed me by being in this movie, with this amazing cast.I don&#65533;t usually like Tara Reid, this time she was worth watching. She was the only &#65533;regular-normal&#65533; person of them all. Mind you, it&#65533;s just in acting, and only in Van Wilder.I watched Van Wilder 3 times, one after the other. I just couldn&#65533;t get enough. So the bonuses came in handy. There was a whole other DVD full of additional stuff, deleted scenes, interviews, and all kinds of VW specials.

One interesting part of this film is that it seems to get tired with the ""campus craziness"" routine and opt for a college romance movie instead.  I'm not sure whether I approve of the decision.  As a college comedy, VAN WILDER ranks among the better ones, but it cannot really maintain any believability for its love story.

It was quite stupid, and I don't know why people are saying, ""The best movie I've ever seen!"" I thought this movie was horriable. I gave it 1.5 stars, rounding up to 2 stars.This movie was about Van Wilder (Ryan Reynolds) has been at Coolidge College for 7 years, never passing (or just leaving.) Van Wilder is a ""party person"" who always has a good time. Geeks and others look up to him, he is a very popular kid for others. He even has own assistant for himself. Van Wilder trys to help everyone though. He's the ""nicer popular person."" And Van Wilder meets this girl named Gwen Pearson (Tara Reid) who is doing an interview on Van. They fall in love, but their not going out. Van's dad finds out that Van has been in College for 7 years, so Van's Dad isn't paying for Van's college funds. Gwen teaches Van to do something with his life, and not stay in college for as long as he is.I thought this movie was getting way to off topic when Gwen came into this movie. It wasn't focusing on the main idea anymore, it was focusing on their relationship (which they really don't have), instead of him getting money and staying into college, like he really wants to do.Acting wise no one was special, none of the characters were the best, but if I had to pick someone it would be Tara Reid, followed up by Ryan Reynolds. No special apperances were really made except for Chris Owen.Over all I would give this movie 1.5 stars, which rounds up to 2 stars. This movie had some of it's moments, but really it wasn't hilarious. The begining was the best. The first like 20 minutes. Nothing was that great, the plot was stupid, I'd give it 2/5 stars. Acting I'd give 2/5. And extras, and other I'd give 1.5/5 stars. So I gave it 2 stars.

There's tons of movies like these, and rarely do i feel bound to them as much as i did to this one. Unlike Kevin Smith's greatness to the averageness of comedy on say Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, the few gems that surface on the average teen genre don't entirely rely on the script, but rather on the performance. Saving Silverman is a good example. Jack Black and Steve Zahn pretty much own the whole movie. They put that little something into it that makes you not care how many times you watch it when you feel like comedy rather than anything else. Ryan Reynolds did exactly that with this movie. His personality obviously transmutated into his character, which is much like that back in his sitcoms days. He is a superb comedian, and much like Will Ferrel, he knows how to say things and how to act that same expression out. It's those little details that put you at ease and eager to watch it again. He is also extremely well complemented by Taj, Kal Penn, who gives additional comic relief throughout.Trying not to focus much on the fact it's a National Lampoon movie, and the fact that it relies so much on the tried and true boy-meets-girl linearity, it's still a very good movie.

587760,A1VU8D2148AKAG,B00005JKJY,Francisco Pizarro,"[1, 2]","The National Lampoon's series of films have brought us all types of comedies with varying degrees of success. From true american classics like Animal House and the Vacation franchise, to less-than-stellar (Loaded Weapon I and Barely Legal comes readily to mind). Van Wilder, in my humble opinion, is a very deserving entry to the series.The film's title is extremely appropriate for this film as not only is the story centered around the titular character but Ryan Reynolds is the anchor that holds the entire thing together. Talk about perfect casting, Reynolds truly shines with a combination of physical(his facial expressions throughout the film are priceless) and verbal comedy. Kal Penn, playing his assistant delivers as well. This film probably earned him his future leading roles. The film at its core is all about the classic college stereotypes and one man's crusade to bring them together. If this sounds overly dramatic in the context of this film, don't think for a second that I'm somehow trying to elevate this film above what it really is. The film is a comedy and a raunchy college comedy at that. It is what it is. But in a genre drowning in imitation and cliches, Van Wilder shines because it takes those cliches and makes a really funny (and yes, gross at times but still funny)film. Speaking of cliches, I found it extremely fitting that Curtis Armstrong (Booger on Revenge of the Nerds) and Tim Matheson (Eric Stratton in Animal House)appear in the film playing straight-up, downright nerdy, older characters in the films. It is a nice little nod to the past of the genre and kind of a passing of the torch moment I really enjoyed.As far the quality of the Blu-Ray disc, its pretty much par for the course. Nothing ground-braking here. While this is by far the best the film has looked on Home Video, (and frankly theaters as well)it falls a bit short compared to other releases of the same time. The film was released in 2002 so it is pretty new compared to other catalog titles but then again I would suspect that this film was not a priority in the ""quality transfer"" queue for the studio.If you don't already have this on DVD and are a fan of the genre I highly recommend this release. In fact, watch in succession with Animal House and see how much (or how little it would seem at times) this genre has evolved(?) through the years.",3,Van Wilder on Blu-Ray,1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,2360,"['National', 'Lampoon', 'series', 'films', 'have', 'brought', 'types', 'comedies', 'varying', 'degrees', 'success', 'true', 'american', 'classics', 'Animal', 'House', 'Vacation', 'franchise', 'less-than-stellar', 'Loaded', 'Weapon', 'Barely', 'Legal', 'readily', 'mind', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'humble', 'opinion', 'very', 'deserving', 'entry', 'series.The', 'film', 'title', 'extremely', 'appropriate', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'story', 'centered', 'titular', 'character', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'anchor', 'entire', 'thing', 'together', 'Talk', 'perfect', 'casting', 'Reynolds', 'truly', 'combination', 'physical', 'facial', 'expressions', 'film', 'are', 'priceless', 'verbal', 'comedy', 'Kal', 'Penn', 'playing', 'assistant', 'delivers', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'probably', 'earned', 'future', 'leading', 'roles', 'film', 'core', 'classic', 'college', 'stereotypes', 'one', 'man', 'crusade', 'bring', 'together', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'context', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'second', ""'m"", 'somehow', 'trying', 'elevate', 'film', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'comedy', 'raunchy', 'college', 'comedy', 'what', 'genre', 'drowning', 'imitation', 'cliches', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'shines', 'cliches', 'really', 'funny', 'yes', 'gross', 'times', 'still', 'funny', 'film', 'Speaking', 'cliches', 'found', 'extremely', 'fitting', 'Curtis', 'Armstrong', 'Booger', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'Eric', 'Stratton', 'Animal', 'House', 'appear', 'film', 'playing', 'straight-up', 'downright', 'nerdy', 'older', 'characters', 'films', 'nice', 'little', 'nod', 'past', 'genre', 'kind', 'passing', 'torch', 'moment', 'really', 'enjoyed.As', 'far', 'quality', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'pretty', 'much', 'par', 'course', 'Nothing', 'ground-braking', 'here', 'far', 'best', 'film', 'looked', 'Home', 'Video', 'frankly', 'theaters', 'well', 'bit', 'short', 'compared', 'other', 'releases', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'released', '2002', 'pretty', 'new', 'compared', 'other', 'catalog', 'titles', 'then', 'again', 'would', 'suspect', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'priority', 'quality', 'transfer', 'queue', 'studio.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'DVD', 'are', 'fan', 'genre', 'highly', 'recommend', 'release', 'fact', 'watch', 'succession', 'Animal', 'House', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'how', 'little', 'would', 'seem', 'times', 'genre', 'evolved', 'years']",National Lampoon's Van Wilder R-Rated Edition  VHS

Van has been attending the same college for the past 7 years.  Initially it seems that he is doing it just to piss off his father but there could be more to it than that.  When his father visits he finds Van throwing the biggest party of the year and that his fellow students look upon Van with awe.  Dad puts a stop to all that by refusing to pay Van's way any longer.  The rest of the movie deals with Wilder finding ways to stay in school, falling in love, and realizing there is more to himself than he initially thought.This is of course a formula movie.  Unfortunately it isn't exactly a successful one.  The story is relatively weak, the humor falls flat on it's face often, the acting is average (Ryan Reynolds character of Van seems very similar to his Berg of Two Guys and a Girl fame) and you really don't care about the characters that much.  The movie wasn't bad; it just wasn't all that good.  There were some funny moments but they were few and far between.

587763,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00005JKJY,Jason,"[2, 3]","Van Wilder is a movie about everything people love about college, the reasons most reminisced.  It's about debauchery, alcohol, parties, and sex-crazed young adults.  Tailored to a younger male audience, it's full of gross-out humor, genetalia jokes, and crude putdowns.Ryan Reynolds must have been jumping up and down for this role.  It is unequivocally made for his nonchalant, cool-guy comedic delivery.Van (Reynolds) has been at Coolidge college for 7 years.  He knows everyone.  He knows everything.  He is basically the most popular kid on the entire campus.  Essentially, he's whatFerris Buellerwould have been in college - a complete slacker with potential for greatness.When Van's father finds out he's been paying for Van to go to school for seven years, the tuition payments are cut.  When faced with his lack of funding, Van, with the help of his personal assistant Taj (Kal Penn) - an Indian exchange student who desperately wants to have wild college experiences and memories - begin to throw parties in exchange for hard cash.Meanwhile, Gwen (Tara Reid before she had all that busted plastic surgery and her before her skin began melting) is an aspiring journalist who is assigned a story on Van Wilder.  Neither she nor her pre-med boyfriend Richard are happy about it, and despite the fact that she slowly falls for Van, the incumbent is not going to just give in to the guy who has started to pay for tuition by becoming a party planner.Possibly the grossest and cruel payback scheme in history is devised, Van follows Gwen's lead when it comes to motivation and graduation, Taj gets his experience, and just about everyone - even a well-endowed bulldog - enjoys a happy ending.

The movie is very funny and some great comedic moments, mostly coming from the star of the film, Ryan Reynolds. Ryan has some really good on screen chemistry and I sure hope to see him in some more comedies to come. The film has a good, although sometimes off the wall gross, script and keeps things interesting most of the way through. (Although the film is a little bit on the predictable side) The supporting cast does a great job, especially the part of ""Taj"" who provides some of the funniest moments in the movie, next to Ryan Reynolds. The only weak link I found in the cast is Tara Reid. She is simply a terrible actress. No talent at all. A monkey could act better than her. Totally listless and uninspired. It is very obvious that her acting jobs did not come to her due to her incredible acting talent. She should be thankful she's so good looking or she would be acting in some off off off off off broadway production of Our Town.Otherwise, the movie comes off pretty funny. It drags in a few cases, but picks back up rather quickly. I gave it 3 stars. I took away 1 star because I felt that they could have worked with the story a little more. (Maybe show some more of the ""parties"" Van plans) I mean, he earned all this money for planning all these parties and we got to see, what, 2 of them?!?

After watching it, I was sadly disappointed in not only the quality of its story/humor but also in how it portrays college life.There is nothing innovative in ""Van Wilder"".  The story is your basic tale of the ""rich kid who doesn't work at school and therefore hasn't graduated in 7 years.""  Throw a girl into the mix, sprinkle some relationship problems, and you have a trite, meaningless film.  That is exactly what this reeking pustule of cinematic fiction is.  The humor relies only on obscenities and crass sexuality, not giving the viewer any sort of edification (aesthetically, comically, or otherwise).In addition to this, ""Van Wilder"" promotes only the worst aspects of college life, glorifying them at at time when such aspects should be reprimanded.  The events in the movie promote the partying, obsessed-with-relationships style of life which is indicative of the introversion which will destroy Western civilization.  This is definitely not what this Nation's youth needs during a critical time in our history and the history of the world.I'm sorry, world of Amazon, I know that this is not the type of review that you want to see.

587781,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B00005JKJY,Mitch Weaver,"[1, 1]","The story revolves around the big man on campus Van Wilder(Ryan Reynolds). He is the most popular kid in the school and is known by basically everyone. However, he has been there for seven years and now his dad finally decides to stop paying his tuition. Van is determined to stay in school and turns to the aid of a secretary that he hires (played by the hilarious Indian actor Kal Penn). They come up with the idea of planning parties, and soon everyone on campus wants a party that has been planned by Van Wilder. Meanwhile, a reporter for the school paper ( Tara Reid), is determined to get the scoop on Van Wilder because no one ever has before. However, her boyfriend Richard ( Daniel Cosgrove) is the head of a geeky fraternity and is very jealous. He goes out of his way to make Van Wilder's life miserable. Now Van must be able to stay in school and impress the reporter while getting even with her boyfriend.Before I watched this film, I was extremely skeptical. From the previews, it looked it was going to be horrible. However, since National Lampoon has had a pretty good track record when it comes to comedies, I decided to give it a shot. Van Wilder turned out to be one of the funniest films I have seen in the last 5 years. In fact, by the time the end of the film rolled around, my stomach hurt from laughing so much. Some of gags in this movie really push the envelope when it comes to disgusting and raunchy comedy. That is why my advice is to watch this film on an empty stomach, because a few of the gags will make you want to throw up after you see them. They are so raunchy in fact, that they make American Pie look weak by comparison. The plot of the movie is ridiculous and borders on being stupid, which is why I can only give Van Wilder 4 stars. But the movie makes up for it by providing non-stop laughs and tons of great gags.If you are looking for a comedy to watch, don't pass up Van Wilder. This is the funniest college comedy I have seen since Animal House. I would even go as far to say that it is the Animal House of today. The 2 Disc DVD itself actually provides for some pretty good extras.

What you will see, though, is a funny and entertaining movie. Which are the reasons why I thought we all watched comedies. Van Wilder is still at Coolidge College. For &quot;the better part of a decade.&quot; His Dad decides to cut his losses and cancels the tuition check for the upcoming semester. How Van copes with that decision lays the groudwork for the rest of the film.We find out that Van hasn't wasted his time at Coolidge, at all. Van is an above-average student, a partier, a philanthropist, a cheerleader, an inspiration to his fellow students, and, for the past couple of years has been just 18 credits shy of graduating.  And for all of the right reasons. He just loves what he does, even if it is in college and not in the 'real' world. Gwen Pearson's (Tara Reid) job, as a campus newspaper reporter, is to find out what makes him tick. The rest of the movie lays out the ups and downs of raising the necessary tuition money ('Topless Tutors', for one) and the inevitable reckoning that it's time to move on. And it does it in entertaining and sometimes gut-wrenchingly funny ways.&quot;Van Wilder&quot; is populated with unique characters and some interesting, almost cameo-type, performances.  You'll see Erik Estrada, Curtis Armstrong and Paul Gleason in small supporting roles that still give them a chance to display their talent. My favorites are Taj, the Indian exchange student hired as Van's personal assistant, and Daniel Cosgrove as Van's soon-to-be arch nemesis. The movie is also loaded with hilarious scenes that play much like SNL skits. Examples? The entire scene on auditioning for the personal assistant's job; Van's visit to Gwen's house where he meets her parents; Hutch and the 'bong'; and Van's 'day in court.' Of course, if you haven't seen the movie none of this means much to you.Which gets me to... see the movie. Now, I'm sure that some of you will hate it. Understood.

Van Wilder was a pathetic attempt to define a generation.However, I must say that I enjoyed it. It was filled with the great, endearing characters that made us love National Lampoons to begin with. Ryan Reynolds was great, but while being at times very raunchy, had a certain sweetness to him. Tara Reid was great. But the thing that carried the movie was the writing. From the opening scene, the writing enchants and enthralls you and keeps you laughing.The R-rating is for some SICK humor, sexuality, nudity and  language.

Since they weren't, I have to rely on this movie to remind me that some people have the ability to be quite extreme, even if it's just fiction.This movie walks the fine line between decent comedy and crude humor. Sometimes it lingers a little too long on the crude humor side, like an entire sequence involving a dog, some eclairs, and the Delta Iota Kappa Fraternity. Even though I've been told they used creamed honey, that scene still makes me gag.There are a few truely funny moments, like Taj's interview for Van Wilder's personal assistant, Sick Boy, the ice hockey challenge between Van and Gwen, and the running feud between McDougal's car and Wilder's golf cart. However, there are also equally disturbing moments like the eclair scene I mentioned, Richard's Northwestern interview, and Wilder's talk with the woman in charge of tuition payments.Overall this isn't a bad movie if you don't mind some crude humor.

He is pretty much the life of the party and he revels in it greatly.  It's only until his dad (Matheson) finds out that Van is still in school and places a halt to Van's tuition payment that he realizes that it's time to get his head in the game and find a way to graduate and pay tuition.A story printed by the school's star reporter Gwen (Tara Reid) causes Van to become a party planner and raise the money for his tuition, along with the help of his closest friend (Teck Holmes of ""Real World"" fame) and his personal assistant (Kal Penn). When a relationship develops between Van and Gwen, Gwen's pretentious boyfriend Richard tries to put a wedge between them.  When Van learns of this, he gets a little revenge in one of the most ingenious and disgusting ways ever devised (trust me, this has the humping a pie thing beaten hands down, no pun intended...)Van Wilder is pretty hilarious in spots and somewhat disgusting in others, particularly the classic payback Van pulls on Richard and later on when Gwen also gets a little revenge on Richard when she learns a little something that Richard did behind Gwen's back.  Also, Penn and Holmes have some gut-busting moments in support and is it nice to see Matheson deciding to continue his association with National Lampoon by bridging the gap between Animal House and Van Wilder.A word of advice, though: if you have a weak stomach, this is not the movie for you.

I'm sure there's a huuuuuge difference... not.  Bear that in mind.Van Wilder is a seventh-year undergrad at Coolidge College.  Having become a school institution after attending so long, he's pretty much become the master of all things collegiate.  Except for the graduating part.  Life is fun and games for Van and his pals.  He even has students queued to interview to become his personal assistant.  He ends up choosing an Indian student who craves a taste of the bacchanalian life before being sent home.  How better to fulfill that desire than with Van Wilder as your mentor!  Wha-whooo!  Van parties and remains ignorant of his situation until a school newspaper reporter named Gwen (Tara Reid) shows up because she's required to do a piece on him.  Soon enough they end up falling for each other (surprise!) and he gets serious about school.  But there's a couple small problems:  Her pre-med, frat-boy boyfriend, and Van has to actually go to class.There's not much new here, really.  Plop this down among all the other innumerable movies of this ilk.  The American Pie movies are funnier.  They also have more characters who are funny.  This one rests on just a few.Having said that, this movie has some humorous moments.  The best laughs come from Van's and his roommate's pet bulldog's genitalia.  (No pun intended.)  Or uncontrollable bowel movements.  These incidents did make me crack up (and cringe in disgust).  They just happen to be at the exteme end of sick humor.Viewable for those who like gross-out humor and get your thrills from a couple flashes of female breasts.
