I had read the book recently which is very worthwhile if you get the chance.  Coburn is great as usual as the somewhat reprobate great-grandfather.  Tom Drake who you probably remember best from Meet Me In St. Louis is good as the older &#34;Robbie&#34;, but it is really Dean Stockwell as the young Robbie that steals the show.  You also might enjoy a young Jessica Tandy as Robbie's aunt.  Unfortunately you can never pull all the story lines into a two hour movie that are covered in a best seller, but they do a fair job here.  I have read a number of 30's and 40's era best sellers that were butchered in their movie versions and thankfully most of the charm, humor, and pain that are in the Cronin book are brought to the film.  Very much worth a watch.",4,Really good film,1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,852,"['Thought', 'giving', 'one', 'five', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'quite', 'rate', 'classics', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'recently', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'get', 'chance', 'Coburn', 'great', 'as', 'usual', 'somewhat', 'reprobate', 'great-grandfather', 'Tom', 'Drake', 'who', 'probably', 'remember', 'best', 'Meet', 'Me', 'St.', 'Louis', 'good', 'older', '34', 'Robbie', '34', 'really', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'young', 'Robbie', 'show', 'also', 'might', 'enjoy', 'young', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'Robbie', 'aunt', 'Unfortunately', 'can', 'never', 'pull', 'story', 'lines', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'are', 'covered', 'best', 'seller', 'do', 'fair', 'job', 'here', 'have', 'read', 'number', '30', '40', 'era', 'best', 'sellers', 'were', 'butchered', 'movie', 'versions', 'thankfully', 'most', 'charm', 'humor', 'pain', 'are', 'Cronin', 'book', 'are', 'brought', 'film', 'Very', 'much', 'watch']",The Green Years
