1289364,ADZATLT2UTRRQ,B002U1FFDE,"Michael Eller ""LostYourMummy?""","[7, 9]","I absolutely loved The Eleventh Hour, the 2006 BBC production, and was very disappointed the series ended with only four episodes. I was glad to see CBS picked up the storyline starring Rufus Sewell (who I also admire), and purchased this DVD set expecting very similar stories. Sadly, I never learn to curb my enthusiasm and ""test run"" a TV series by viewing a bit of it through my mail order DVD rental program, and now I am stuck with a pricey DVD set that I will only watch once. The original British series was written as based on science-fact, positing stories of deep ethical choices, powerful personal motives, or seriously unethical interests grown from power and money. I even learned a tidbit about Hans Geiger and his work with the Nazi's. Each of the four stories were entirely believable, however fictional the premise. In hind sight, I must admit the 90-minute format of the British series allowed for more depth, intrigue, and development than a forty-four minute American sprint to a climax. The American series made a number of mistakes, the most egregious for me being the copying of original scripts. If one spends millions on a new series, I would hope one has enough money to pay for a new story and not copy-cat (not once but twice!) the creativity of our English cousins. I was hoping that the characters, Ian Hood in England and Jacob Hood in America, would be related, perhaps as father and son, allowing for more developed story line and even a bit of cameo by Patrick Stewart (Ian Hood). But no, that kind of barrowing of story line from Britain is not seen as a creative enhancement, we only copy complete scripts. Finally, in one American episode, we see Jacob (Rufus Sewell) replying to a TV broadcast of commercial advertising with the line, ""Lies""; he changes the station, views another commercial and says of it, ""Lies!"" He endeared himself to me with that moment. Yet, in the following episode, Jacob Hood saves the day for all by inventing a chimarized gene therapy in a matter of hours, using a simple, unsophisticated, college science laboratory. I want to know how I, too, can perform a polymerase chain reaction with a bit of glass and a Bunsen burner. He then injects a suffering youth with his concoction without any test or study, committing the same act of seriously unethical medical practice that originally placed the suffering youth in jeopardy. Say again, ""Lies!"" (The youth, by the way, is trapped for at least a day in a Coast Guard decompression chamber to control the biological reaction that would otherwise kill him and I kept asking dumb questions like, ""Where's the toilet?"" (in that chamber?).) This is not science fact; the American version is very much science fiction in its full implausibility. Anyone want to by this series at reduced cost? I've got one.",3,This Eleventh Hour is a Bit Too late,1284768000,"09 18, 2010",2010,2817,"['absolutely', 'loved', 'Eleventh', 'Hour', '2006', 'BBC', 'production', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'series', 'ended', 'only', 'four', 'episodes', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'CBS', 'picked', 'up', 'storyline', 'starring', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'who', 'also', 'admire', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'set', 'expecting', 'very', 'similar', 'stories', 'Sadly', 'never', 'learn', 'curb', 'enthusiasm', 'test', 'run', 'TV', 'series', 'viewing', 'bit', 'mail', 'order', 'DVD', 'rental', 'program', 'now', 'am', 'stuck', 'pricey', 'DVD', 'set', 'will', 'only', 'watch', 'once', 'original', 'British', 'series', 'was', 'written', 'based', 'science-fact', 'positing', 'stories', 'deep', 'ethical', 'choices', 'powerful', 'personal', 'motives', 'seriously', 'unethical', 'interests', 'grown', 'power', 'money', 'even', 'learned', 'tidbit', 'Hans', 'Geiger', 'work', 'Nazi', 'four', 'stories', 'were', 'entirely', 'believable', 'however', 'fictional', 'premise', 'hind', 'sight', 'must', 'admit', '90-minute', 'format', 'British', 'series', 'allowed', 'more', 'depth', 'intrigue', 'development', 'forty-four', 'minute', 'American', 'sprint', 'climax', 'American', 'series', 'made', 'number', 'mistakes', 'most', 'egregious', 'being', 'copying', 'original', 'scripts', 'one', 'millions', 'new', 'series', 'would', 'hope', 'one', 'enough', 'money', 'pay', 'new', 'story', 'not', 'copy-cat', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'creativity', 'English', 'cousins', 'was', 'hoping', 'characters', 'Ian', 'Hood', 'England', 'Jacob', 'Hood', 'America', 'would', 'be', 'related', 'perhaps', 'father', 'son', 'allowing', 'more', 'developed', 'story', 'line', 'even', 'bit', 'cameo', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Ian', 'Hood', 'kind', 'barrowing', 'story', 'line', 'Britain', 'not', 'seen', 'creative', 'enhancement', 'only', 'copy', 'complete', 'scripts', 'Finally', 'one', 'American', 'episode', 'see', 'Jacob', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'replying', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'commercial', 'advertising', 'line', 'station', 'commercial', 'endeared', 'moment', 'following', 'episode', 'Jacob', 'Hood', 'day', 'inventing', 'chimarized', 'gene', 'therapy', 'matter', 'hours', 'using', 'simple', 'unsophisticated', 'college', 'science', 'laboratory', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'too', 'can', 'perform', 'polymerase', 'chain', 'reaction', 'bit', 'glass', 'Bunsen', 'burner', 'then', 'suffering', 'youth', 'concoction', 'test', 'study', 'committing', 'same', 'act', 'seriously', 'unethical', 'medical', 'practice', 'originally', 'placed', 'suffering', 'youth', 'jeopardy', 'Say', 'again', 'youth', 'way', 'trapped', 'least', 'day', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'decompression', 'chamber', 'control', 'biological', 'reaction', 'would', 'otherwise', 'kill', 'kept', 'asking', 'dumb', 'questions', 'Where', 'toilet', 'chamber', 'not', 'science', 'fact', 'American', 'version', 'very', 'much', 'science', 'fiction', 'full', 'implausibility', 'Anyone', 'want', 'series', 'reduced', 'cost', ""'ve"", 'got', 'one']",N/A
