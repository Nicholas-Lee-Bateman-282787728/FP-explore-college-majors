627672,A1U58QQTR5UG1N,B00005JN80,anorthernsole,"[2, 18]","The A-Team: Season OneI have one question...where is the A---?  I watched the first 6 episodes of this series only to find that there was no adult entertainment and ZERO A--- warfare which was the whole reason why I bought this series.  If you ask me, the title is very misleading.  Let me back up...so I purchased the DVD series at the suggestion of my friend Stevenson (who also recommended ""The Backdoor Bandit"" -> awesome film!!!) so needless to say I had some pretty high expectations going into this.  I turned on the DVD player and was intrigued by the intro; ""In 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade..."" The next line should have gone like this; ""and returned to the brothels of Vietnam to conduct a new form of warfare against the North Vietnamese Communist Forces...A--- warfare!!!""  This was creator's Stephen J. Cannell and Frank Lupo's one and only chance to take all of the corruption, pain, and destruction that was the Vietnam Conflict and turn it into a masterpiece of adult cinematography.  There was so much potential to do right here but like the conflict in South East Asia, we let it slip through our hands.  Instead of using his black gloved rubber arm/hand to destroy the backsides of the enemy, John 'Hannibal' Smith (George Peppard) sits back and enjoys some Swisher Sweets.  The teasing doesn't stop there...Templeton 'Faceman' Peck's (played by Dirk Benedict) portrayal as the ""A-Team's"" womanizing pretty boy doesn't add up to very much.  Any opportunity that Peck has at A---ly violating a woman gets shot down when Hannibal has ""a plan come together.""  Despite all of these setbacks I still watched hoping that Mr. T would break the chains of racial tension in this country by displaying his combat training in A--- warfare on some young white women.  Guess what?  It never happened!!!  This is the WORST adult film I have ever purchased!!!",1,Where's the A---?,1345507200,"08 21, 2012",2012,1992,"['A-Team', 'Season', 'OneI', 'have', 'one', 'question', 'where', 'A', 'watched', 'first', '6', 'episodes', 'series', 'only', 'find', 'was', 'adult', 'entertainment', 'ZERO', 'A', 'warfare', 'was', 'whole', 'reason', 'why', 'bought', 'series', 'ask', 'title', 'very', 'misleading', 'Let', 'back', 'up', 'so', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'series', 'suggestion', 'friend', 'Stevenson', 'who', 'also', 'recommended', 'Backdoor', 'Bandit', 'awesome', 'film', 'so', 'needless', 'say', 'had', 'pretty', 'high', 'expectations', 'going', 'turned', 'DVD', 'player', 'was', 'intrigued', 'intro', '1972', 'crack', 'commando', 'unit', 'was', 'sent', 'prison', 'military', 'court', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'men', 'promptly', 'escaped', 'maximum', 'security', 'stockade', 'next', 'line', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'returned', 'brothels', 'Vietnam', 'conduct', 'new', 'form', 'warfare', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'Communist', 'Forces', 'warfare', 'was', 'creator', 'Stephen', 'J.', 'Cannell', 'Frank', 'Lupo', 'one', 'only', 'chance', 'take', 'corruption', 'pain', 'destruction', 'was', 'Vietnam', 'Conflict', 'turn', 'masterpiece', 'adult', 'cinematography', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'do', 'right', 'here', 'conflict', 'South', 'East', 'Asia', 'let', 'hands', 'Instead', 'using', 'black', 'gloved', 'rubber', 'arm/hand', 'destroy', 'backsides', 'enemy', 'John', ""'Hannibal"", 'Smith', 'George', 'Peppard', 'back', 'Swisher', 'Sweets', 'teasing', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'Templeton', ""'Faceman"", 'Peck', 'played', 'Dirk', 'Benedict', 'portrayal', 'A-Team', 'womanizing', 'pretty', 'boy', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'very', 'much', 'opportunity', 'Peck', 'A', '-ly', 'violating', 'woman', 'shot', 'down', 'when', 'Hannibal', 'plan', 'come', 'together', 'setbacks', 'still', 'watched', 'hoping', 'Mr.', 'T', 'would', 'break', 'chains', 'racial', 'tension', 'country', 'displaying', 'combat', 'training', 'warfare', 'young', 'white', 'women', 'Guess', 'what', 'never', 'happened', 'WORST', 'adult', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'purchased']",The A-Team: Season One

For those who didn't watch it on primetime TV in the 80's (or even syndicated in later years), the A-Team is one of those shows where bullets fly, bad guys are taken down, no one seems to get killed (unless that was for the set-up of the episode), and there were plenty of insults and tongue-in-cheek humor to go around.The show revolves around 4 guys who served together in Vietnam and were accused of a crime they didn't commit. Now, fugitives in their own country, they make a living hiring themselves out as soldiers of fortune, helping those who need it and hire them (and can pay for it, although I don't seem to remember seeing them getting paid huge sums of money very often!). The team consists of: COL Hannibal Smith, the leader of the A-Team, who is often &quot;on the jazz&quot; as his teammates would put it (watch the series and find out what that means!). SGT Boscoe Albert (aka B.A. for Bad Attitude) Baracus, who's the teams chief mechanic/engineer, and a man who doesn't take any amount of crap from anyone. 1LT Templeton (aka Faceman, The Face) Peck, the smooth-talker who is the chief scam artist and ladies' man of the team. And last, but certainly not least, is CPT H.M. (aka Howling Mad) Murdock, the resident loon and pilot for just about everything they fly in the series.The cast was great together (once Dirk Benedict took over the role of Face after the pilot) and the shows, while cheesy in some aspects, were great fun.

Having escaped from a maximum security prison, the four man team survives in the anonymity of the Los Angeles underground.

I found the sound quality on this season to be allright, and the images were of decent quality. Admittedly, this show was just beginning to find its way during the first season, the pilot two-parter gets them started with some memorable episodes in there...one just has to laugh at Hannibal Smith's (George Peppard) character and his persistence in getting arrested by the police in ``Pros and Cons'' to break up a prison boxing ring...that clip is repeatedly aired in the show's intro sequence. ``A Small And Deadly War'' is also a good episode as is ``The Out-Of-Towners''. The chaser of the intrepid quartet this season is Colonel Lynch, who gets a whiff of the fugitives but never really gets too close. Decent stunts in this season, but they get better as time goes along as do the stories. A bit of a shame that this is really the only full season with Amy Allen (Melinda Culea), since she is very nice to look at.

627689,A319SKSB556033,B00005JN80,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[68, 76]","The A-Team is one of the most fondly remembered TV shows in history. For a long, long time we've been asking for it to be released on DVD and this year Universal finally acknowledged or requests. Is it worth the wait and money? Kinda.First of all an introduction to the A-Team is needed.First we have the leader, John 'Hannibal' Smith (the late, great George Peppard on top form) a Colonel in the US army so called because of his expert war tactics being likened to that of the legendary Hannibal Barca.Then there is Templeton 'The Face' Peck (Dirk Benedict) the smooth con-man who is relied upon to get whatever supplies are needed.Bosco 'BA' Baracus (the very funny Mr. T) is the muscle. No one argues or torments when BA is around.And finally, Captain HM Murdock (Dwight Schultz) a crazy pilot who only pretends to be insane for the fun (and shelter) but can be serious when needed.Season One also featured Amanda Amy Allen (Melinda Culea), a newspaper reporter who follows the A-Team around and covers their antics. She never did much else but she has a beautiful smile and gorgeous legs that go all the way up.As you know the A-Team are on the lam for a crime they didn't commit (allegedly they robbed the Bank of Hanoi during the Vietnam war) and help folks out whenever injustice brings misery or despair.The episodes in season one are as follows...1 and 2. Mexican Slayride parts 1 and 2-The pilot episode in which the team go to Mexico to rescue a reporter held hostage by guerillas. It's okay, nothing special. Ron Palilo guest stars.3. Children Of Jamestown-The team are hired to rescue a girl kidnapped by mad christian fundementalists. Gerrit Graham guest stars.4. Pros And Cons-The A-Team go undercover in a prison to expose a corrupt warden and his brutal gladatorial prison death matches.5. A Small And Deadly War-A SWAT team moonlighting as hitmen get their comuppance. Dean Stockwell guest stars.6. Black Day At Bad Rock-When BA is injured and taken to a doctor she gets suspicious and calls the fuzz. Bikers later lay siege to the town and the cops need to release them. Sid Haig guest stars.7. The Rabbit Who Ate Las Vegas-A college professor with a foolproof gambling system disappears in Las Vegas. The A-Team are hired to get him back.8. The Out-Of-Towners-The A-Team take on a street-hustler harrassing the innocent citizens of a scared neighborhood. A rather poor episode set in New York. Phony cardboard sets on the Universal backlot do not convince and the budget was certainly not spent on squibs, giving the impression that they are firing blanks. Yaphet Kotto guest stars.9. Holiday In The Hills-When their plane crash lands in hillbilly land the A-Team stop a man from being burnt at the stake (reasons unknown) by hicks. A small war breaks out.10. West Coast Turnaround-The A-Team are hired to take on a corrupt sheriff and help out a man being threatened off his melon farm.11. One More Time-Off they go to Borneo to rescue a VIP and his daughter. Not a good episode. Some random field outside LA makes for a very, very poor 'double' of Borneo (puh-lease), which distracts for most of the show. Amy Steel guest stars.12. Till Death Do Us Part-A recently widowed-woman being forced into marriage by a money hungry businesman hires the A-Team to find out the truth of her late husbands suspicous death. Surely the cops would have discovered it.13. The Beast From The Belly Of A Boeing-Idiot terrorists take over a plane with ludicrous demands. The A-Team sneak aboard and sort it out. Xander Berkely and Andrew Robinson guest star.14. A Nice Place to Visit-A hick family terrorizes a small town but the A-Team (attending the funeral of a Vietnam buddy) sort them out in their own unique way.The quality of the shows ranges from being genuinely well written to rather stupid. But hardly any of them feature inventing! Come on! This was the A-Team trademark. What's going on? Obviously, as the budget increased in later seasons the episodes got more sophisticated. Season One is all hokey and novice in comparison.Oh and all that rubbish you've heard about no one ever dying in The A-Team is nonsense. This season alone features two deaths in episodes 4 and 7.The episodes are very badly presented in this set. The 1.33:1 full frame picture is dirty and damaged with weak, washed-out colors and tinny Dolby Mono sound. I know this is how the show was originally recorded but even a Stereo remix would have been worth it. Though the very abundant ADR is extremely obvious nonetheless. There is not one tiny little extra at all.Universal, I want Season 2 right away. But I will gladly wait longer to get a remastered picture and better sound. This is a great show but the presentation quality on this set is terrible. I know these episodes are over 20 years old but I've seen older stuff look better. And the packaging is rather flimsy too.Pick up for no more than half-price.",4,An iffy start,1103500800,"12 20, 2004",2004,4903,"['A-Team', 'one', 'most', 'fondly', 'remembered', 'TV', 'shows',

It was the wildest wackiest show on the air with more bullets and bang for your buck. And in the early Regan era days of the 80s, it was a reflection of how we were led to look at the world. It bucked the system, which was filled with excess and violence, by using excess and violence in a non dangerous way. It was to TV what the Rambo movies were to the big screen. Escapism carved out of what should be viewed more seriously.And I loved it. Still do. What memories watching this first season, and now anticipating the others to come.This show was part of NBC's Tuesday night line up that was in the 80s what their Thursday night line up was in the mid to late 90s. The ATEAM was on at 8 PM, followed by RIPTIDE (a super show that deserves to be on DVD too - also from Stephen Cannel) and then REMINGTON STEELE at 10 PM. It was a night of action, adventure and cool macho guys.  No one wanted a show on another chanel Tuesdays because these 3 ruled.Naturally, such a high concept as the ATEAM was hard to maintain week to week, so the plots got sillier and more strained as the years went on. But Seasons one and two were top of their form. Season five was excellent as well, as they tried to reinvent the show by having the team caught, tried, and then turned into a secret government special missions team.Enjoy it for what it is though - because shows like it are gone forever. And let's all hope to see DVD releases of many of the great shows from 80s that were part of the same brand of success as the ATEAM.

Season 2 had multiple problems, but Amazon finally got me a good set.Season 1 Episode 1 - pilot movie.  Face was a different actor... It was a pretty good episode, but without Dirk Benedict as face, I didn't like his character as much.  He was too serious, and had no chemistry with other characters.  He wasn't even funny.Quotes I enjoy... B.A. Shut up fool! I pitty the fool! And you won't ever trick me again! - those are classic B.A. mannerisms you can look forward to.  As the seasons when by, he used the other's  dialogue against them, especially Murdock's dialogue which is hilarious.  Every time they do something mischievious b.A. laughs like a kid, and he is good around children and women.  Very likeable.  Mr. T. is a much better B.A. then the shameful 2010 remake A-Team B.A.Face - Dirk Bbenedict (starbuck battlestar galactica) there is no other face.  You can't believe his con man antics could ever work without Dirk Benedict.Hannibal Smith - George Peppard, the leader, the heart of the team.  Always in disguises you look forward to, and escaping military police making them look stupid.  Famous phrase; I love it when a plan comes together! He even paraphrased that once with a quote, which was ingenious.Dwight Schultz Howling Mad Murdock - Escapee from Mental hospital, mostly by face, and he always disguises himself and cons his way to get Murdock out in a comical way.  Remember the episode where he yelled Terrashh Bagg!!! And they kept giving him one to shut him up.  He collected them making it seem like a compulsive disorder, then he escapes and makes a hot air balloon! Who would have seen that coming in the 80's when it first aired? What about when he went to the dentist, and was laughing silly with laughing gas, stealing it for their mission? Great one Murdock!Amy, what can be said about her other than her smile, and a very pretty member of the A-team? I was sad to see her go in the middle of season 2.  I loved the battlestar galactica cylon joke between face and the cylon passing him by because he was starbuck.  These little things are what captivates my attention.  Plus after 800 rounds of bullets and nobody gets hit.  Is a hoot! Obviously meant that way.  Stephen J. Cannell Also did the Greatest american hero and the A-team.  He also did stingray.

627703,AO3P5BXFCXFHD,B00005JN80,Pandra Selivanov,"[2, 2]","***CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!****I watched The A-Team when I was a kid, enthralled with the Tom and Jerry atmosphere, the bickering closeness of B.A. and Murdock, the smooth way Face conned his way in and out of the most improbable scenarios, the zany confidence of Hannibal that no matter what, the plan was going to come together.I'm older now, but there's still something about the show that reels me in. In fact, I would say there are aspects of it now I appreciate more. The genuine bond between the team members is something I enjoy seeing, perhaps because I'm more aware now how rare such bonds are. The absolute trust they had in each other, like when B.A. went undercover in a prison, was chained to another prisoner for a fight to the death, and he knew with absolute certainty that his friends were coming to get him. He never doubted the team would save him, and they did. Their unconditional loyalty to each other, like when Hannibal offered to trade a chemical warfare weapon for Murdock's life. And the warmth of the relationships, like the way Face and Hannibal humored Murdock, who tormented B.A. and yet could always get him to smile-whether or not Murdock saw the smile. These are things that have not only stood the test of time, but have improved and make the show a genuine classic.It's true there was a real cartoon aspect to much of the show, yet it's also true there were some genuinely dramatic episodes. Bounty was a wonderful entry, featuring Dwight Schultz' real wife, Wendy Fulton, as Murdock's love interest. It has some of the warmest moments in the series, as Murdock's feelings develop, and a rather bittersweet ending when the lady comes to visit the pilot in the V.A. hospital and asks him what he's doing there. All he can say is, ""It's a long story.""A Sound of Thunder was a haunting episode which saw the team returning to Vietnam. Their painful memories resurface, and it's chilling to see them moving in the jungle on full alert, years after the war is over. At the end Murdock asks Hannibal if he thought about it before they went back, and Hannibal replies that he remembered, but he didn't think about it. It's all too plain that while they may not think about Vietnam, they will never forget.A particularly compelling episode was Family Reunion, where Murdock learns that the former political adviser the team is protecting is actually Face's father, and the man's daughter is Face's half-sister. He agonizes over whether to tell Face the truth, and when he finally does, it's one of the most intense scenes of the entire series, with Face furiously angry that Murdock didn't tell him sooner.It's constantly being brought up that nobody ever got hurt on The A-Team. Not true. B.A. got shot twice. So did Murdock-once seriously enough for the entire episode to focus on the team's efforts to get him medical attention before he died of his injuries. Murdock was also blinded when a gun went off close to his face. Hannibal and B.A. were poisoned by thugs trying to capture the team. And in the harrowing episode aired as the series finale, Face was shot and spent most of the episode on the floor of a restaurant's kitchen. Dirk Benedict really pulled out all the stops for this one, and it's disturbing to see Face suffering so much pain, frightened and confused and bleeding slowly to death. It's almost as disturbing to see Murdock, who was working as a waiter in the restaurant, grimly sane as he tries to cooperate with the bad guys and tend to Face at the same time. Near the end of the episode, when Murdock gets the drop on the man who shot Face, he beats him senseless and has to be hauled away by Frankie. It's an episode that could hold its own with any drama, and a starkly realistic contrast to most of the series.Was the show sexist? I'm sure that to some people, especially nowadays, it seems that way. My personal opinion is that it was not sexist at all. This was not Mission:Impossible, where a femme fatale was a necessary component of the team. This was a story of a band of brothers whose connection was forged in combat. As Hannibal says to General Fullbright's daughter Tia, in A Sound of Thunder, ""It was a strange time. Nothing you could ever understand."" For what it's worth, I never thought there should be a team member who hadn't been with them during that time. Not the girls, Amy and Tawnia, and not even Frankie, although the producers did try to put him in the same boat as the team by making him a fugitive as well. These characters were bright, talented, charming, had skills that were useful to the team, and were very easy on the eyes, but to me they just didn't seem to fit in because of the context under which the team was formed to begin with.All in all, I'm very grateful The A-Team is still around. It was a cherished part of my childhood, and it's a nice place to visit now that I'm older.

But here's a television series where week after week after week, we watched THAT EXACT SAME outline unfold against a different backdrop, and we loved every second of it: the journey, the call to action, the successful first try, the dark Cambellian cave (where the guys usually created a military arsenal out of pitchforks and stuff) from which the heroes rise up with the newfound power (or half-thrown together quasi-military equipment and a classic Pensor movement)to vanquish the antagonist and live to fight another day.I do like how the late George Peppard's character pays frequent tribute to the man for whom he was namesake: Hannibal (*NOT* the cannibal, no this was the guy who took on the Romans with Elephants).  Overall, it was a fun series if you could get past the fact that you were watching the EXACT SAME story again and again.

627708,A3BM8O13WR87PF,B00005JN80,S. Jones,"[3, 3]","First things first:  there are NO extra features.  No interviews, commentaries, retrospectives, bloopers, deleted scenes.  Nothing!  There's even a pocket for a booklet, but there isn't a booklet for that pocket!  C'mon!  (Did B.A. put this thing together?  I knew they should have let Murdock do it.  Can you imagine the extra features he would have added?  The mind boggles...)  Thank heavens the episodes themselves are worth the viewing, or they'd never make any money off this bare-bones set.  Let's hope they get a clue for the next four seasons.  Anyway, moving on...With the late George Peppard as Colonel John ""Hannibal"" Smith, Mr. T as Sergeant Bosco ""B.A."" Baracus, Dwight Schultz as Captain ""Howlin' Mad"" Murdock, Dirk Benedict as Lieutenant Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck, and Melinda Culea as reporter Amy Amanda Allen (or ""Triple A""), you've got a recipe for lots of fun.  (Can you imagine these people on a commentary track?  I've heard Dirk Benedict on the Battlestar Galactica audio commentary, and I've gotta say, I think he and Dwight Schultz would be a hoot to listen to.)Since there are only the episodes themselves to enjoy, let's take a look at them:Mexican Slayride: The two-hour pilot episode is lengthy, uneven but has some good humor (Murdock gets some great scenes).  It's still hard to watch (for me) as Tim Dunigan plays Faceman instead of Dirk ""Starbuck"" Benedict.  Whether he fits the nickname ""Face"" or not is beside the point; the team chemistry is all wrong.  Rank: 12th of 13Children Of Jamestown: The team is hired to rescue a girl from a crazy cult leader. This is our first glimpse of Benedict as Face, and it is a much better introduction to his character's quirks.  John Saxon is a memorable guest star.  Rank: 10th of 13Pros And Cons: The team infiltrates a prison where prisoners are forced into fight-to-the-death boxing matches. This is going to sound odd for someone who loves The A-Team, but fighting/boxing episodes are not my favorites.  Nonetheless, Murdock's trash bag obsession is fun to watch. Rank: 11th of 13A Small And Deadly War: The team takes on a S.W.A.T. team turned bad. Lots of great guest acting in this one, with Dean Stockwell doing a particularly good job. If you want to see Hannibal ""on the jazz"", this is the episode to watch. Rank: 9th of 13Black Day At Bad Rock: B.A. is wounded, Hannibal and Face are put in the slammer, and both the military police and a murderous biker gang are headed for town with time running out. This is my favorite Season One episode.  Great humor, tongue-in-cheek action, romance with sarcasm, buddy love, 200lb cockroaches... what's not to love??  Rank: 1st of 13The Rabbit Who Ate Las Vegas: The team gets involved in a mob power play when they go to Las Vegas to rescue a college professor. There are some great moments here (Hannibal in costume, Murdock doing a creepy version of Face), but it's probably most famous for two things:  a character actually dying on-screen (okay, he might have been shot just prior), and two men surviving a deadly crash to casually ask each other ""Are you okay?""  This episode definitely has a wink in its eye. Rank: 5th of 13The Out-Of-Towners: The team protects some New York shopkeepers from neighborhood thugs. This one's a classic, with every character showing his own brand of humor.  Most memorable for B.A. attempting to fly and the girl choosing Murdock over Face. Rank: 2nd of 13Holiday In The Hills: The team crashes in the mountains and battles it out with some rednecks. Meanwhile, Amy fights the military police in her own style. Another classic.  (On a side note, try to enjoy the opening sequence and not watch it too much, because you'll see it several times again in later episodes.) Rank: 3rd of 13West Coast Turnaround: The team helps a watermelon farmer from being driven out of business. The worst episode of Season One, with almost no memorable moments... aside from Billy the (invisible) dog! Rank: 13th of 13One More Time: The U.S. government recruits the team to for a rescue mission in Borneo. This is a great hour with a taut final chapter. Rarely do we see a plan NOT come together; thanks to Murdock and Amy's unexpected arrival, the team gets out alive... barely.  Rank: 6th of 13Till Death Do Us Part: The team rescues a wealthy bride from her late father's crooked business partner. It's fun to see Face forced into marriage, but by far the most enjoyable aspect of this episode is Murdock.  Dwight Schultz is clearly having a blast. Rank: 8th of 13The Beast From The Belly Of A Boeing: The team is hired to recapture a hijacked 747. Lots of great scenes: Murdock being declared sane, B.A. going comatose, Hannibal and Face considering their ""price"", Murdock coaching Hannibal... It's memorable from start to finish. Rank: 4th of 13A Nice Place To Visit: The team attends the funeral of a fellow Vietnam vet in a town controlled by a murderous family. With flashbacks to (and real footage from) Vietnam, this episode is very much a tribute to veterans, with a rather poignant ending. Rank: 7th of 13Overall, the first season was full of great humor, perfect team chemistry (the pilot aside), and loads of memorable quotes. Critics hated it for having violence without consequence, but you can't expect realism from this show anymore than you'd expect it from a Saturday morning cartoon.  Not all cartoons are Lord Of The Rings, and not all action is Glory.  This is to action what Galaxy Quest is to science fiction.  Relax!  Enjoy it!  The best thing about this show (aside from the chemistry of the leads) is that they don't ever take themselves too seriously.  (Until Season Five, but that's another story...)  It's definitely worth the money if you love The A-Team or just want to watch another ""guilty pleasure"" 80's show.",4,"No ""A"" For This A-Team Set",1096848000,"10 4, 2004",2004,5790,"['First',

627709,A2RKUQ8GTE8GT,B00005JN80,Sparky,"[33, 34]","I love it when a DVD comes together!The hit 80s TV series that helped save the NBC network finally makes it way to DVD.  The A-Team is the story of a Vietnam crack commando unit made up of four men: Colonel John ""Hannibal"" Smith, Lieutenant Templeton Peck (a.k.a. Face), Captain H.M. (Howlin' Mad) Murdock, and Sergeant B.A. Baracus (Mr. T).They were committed of a crime they didn't commit and escaped from a maximum security stockcade to the Los Angeles underground and survived as soldiers of fortune, helping out those in need.The first season of The A-Team is probably my favorite.  Everything was just original and raw, where they didn't have a care but for themselves and their attitudes were more rough and comedy came as a result of their actions and insults, rather than trying to intentionally be funny.  In later seasons it's the opposite, where the guys seem to become more soft and sensitive to the situations and feelings and comedy seemed to be more of the intent rather than their rough image, and the shows tended to follow the same formula every week.There are 14 episodes in Season 1:Episodes 1 and 2 - Mexican Slayride Part 1 and Part 2 - The two hour pilot.  When a newspaper reporter from the L.A. Courier gets kidnapped by outlaws in Mexico, fellow reporter Amy Allen seeks out The A-Team to rescue him.  Features the only time Faceman is played by Tim Dunigan instead of Dirk Benedict.3. Children of Jamestown - The A-Team is hired to save a girl from a cult led by the Rev. Martin James.  Upon freeing the girl, The A-Team is captured and looks to escape and return the favor to James.  The lesson is, nobody takes Hannibal's boots.4. Pros and Cons - A friend of B.A. escapes prison and gets caught, but not before telling B.A. of the illegal fight-to-the-death matches the prison warden makes them take part in where the winner goes ""free,"" only to become hunted.5. A Small and Deadly War - A straight cop discovers a SWAT team gone bad and hires The A-Team to expose them.6. Black Day at Bad Rock - B.A. is wounded from a previous job that went slightly wrong.  The Team takes him to a doctor in Bad Rock, who helps B.A. but also calls the sheriff and has them arrested thinking they're a part of a biker gang.  Hannibal and Face escape jail, but refuse to let out the jailed gang leader.  When he informs them the rest of the gang is coming to set him free, The A-Team strikes a deal with the sheriffs to protect the town and in turn they aren't arrested.7. The Rabbit Who Ate Las Vegas - A professor who has discovered the perfect formula for gambling is kidnapped by a casino owner.  The A-Team pose as federal agents to rescue him, but when the casino owner is killed they become the prime suspects and must find the real killer to prove their innocence.8. Holiday In The Hills - On their way back from a mission, The A-Team's plane crashes in the Carolina hills, where they stumble across a mob of hillbillies getting ready to burn a man at the stake.  The A-Team saves the man and Murdock takes him for medical attention, while the rest of the guys defend their position while waiting for Murdock to return with help.9. The Out-of-Towners - The A-Team heads to New York City, where a group of local shopkeepers are being bullied into paying money for ""protection"" they don't want.10. West Coast Turnaround - The A-Team is hired by a 'Nam vet to transport his crop of watermelons before they spoil, but they are met with resistance from another local rancher who controls much of the valley and is trying to put him out of business.11. One More Time - The A-Team is finally captured by Col. Lynch, but his authority is quickly taken away by the U.S. gov't, who strike a deal with the Team to send them to Borneo to rescue a general (who B.A. punched in Vietnam) and his daughter, who are being held captive by guerrilas.12. Til Death Do Us Part - The A-Team is hired to save Jackie Taylor from marrying Calvin Cutter against her will.  Jackie and Calvin had been dating, but once Jackie's father died and she inherited his company (which Cutter works for), Calvin's real intentions became clear.  But since Calvin owns most of Wilson County, Jackie really had no way to escape him.  Features classic moments such as Murdock almost marrying the groom, and Faceman getting married?!  Definitely one of the best episodes!13. The Beast From The Belly Of A Boeing - Hijackers take over an airplane and make demands for money and that the FBI and police not be involved if they want the passengers to survive.  Hannibal and Face pose as the president and vice president of Beller Air to infiltrate the plane, while Murdock and B.A. sneak onboard while fueling up the plane.  The only problem is the plane takes off when it's not suppose to and B.A., who is afraid of flying, goes into a state of comatose, and it's up to Murdock to save the Team.Definitely a must own DVD set for all A-Team fans and those of classic 80s TV series!",5,On The Jazz!,1083369600,"05 1, 2004",2004,4958,"['love', 'when', 'DVD', 'together', 'hit', '80s', 'TV', 'series', 'helped', 'save', 'NBC',

627710,A178LLZ84A2JB5,B00005JN80,"S. Spears ""Artwomyn""","[1, 1]","The A-Team was basically a fun show to watch. It was about 4 Vietnam vets, who were framed for a war crime they didn't commit. They escaped from a military prison, and wound-up on the run from military officials.They made their living as Soldiers-of-Fortune, which meant that in every episode, someone hired the A-team to get them out of one jam or another. While doing so, they had to evade their pursuers; bumbling Col. Lynch, and (after the first season) deadly-determined Col. Decker.The team was led by Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith (played with swaggering relish by George Peppard). He was the brains of the group, and was known to constantly exclaim; 'I love it when a plan comes together!'Actor Dwight Schultz played Capt. ""Howling Mad"" Murdock. Murdock was indeed certifiably crazy. The team always had to break him out of mental hospitals, whenever they needed him for his cracker-jack piloting skills (he could fly anything that could be flown). This was a running joke during the entire series. I thought it got stale after a while though.Lt. Templeton ""Face Man"" Peck, was the devastatingly handsome, con-man of the team. Actor Dirk Benedict (of Battlestar Galactica) played the ""Face"" character with smarmy perfection. ""Face Man's"" great looks and oily charm, always came in handy. Whenever the team needed to finesse any sticky situation, or finagle necessities from someone, it was ""Face Man"" who always came through.Then there was B.A. (which stood for Badass) Barracus. Played by the muscle-bound, menacing Mr. T., he was the guy nobody dared mess with. B.A. could always be counted on to whop the villain's behinds. He also was the team's expert mechanic, who could fix anything. Beneath his snarling exterior though, was a guy that had one big fear-he was terrified of flying. The rest of the team always had to find ingenious ways of sedating him (without his knowledge) before putting him in a plane or 'copter. This was another running-joke through the duration of the series. And, like the Mad-Murdock mental-hospital-breakout shtick, it too got stale after awhile.This was a macho show, with lots of violence, shooting, and a 'no gals allowed' mentality. The one woman who was a regular on the series, was a reporter who tagged-along with the team-on the condition that she not make a nuisance of herself. I was always shocked that nobody ever got hurt from all the violence! It all seemed to be tongue-in-cheek though.Since the A-Team always foiled the bad-guys in every episode, I think that this was what made the show so popular. That, and the great chemistry between the four A-Team members. Their camaraderie, and loyalty to each other, really held the show together.Though I disliked the intense macho element of the show, I thought it was quite entertaining in its own way. It's enjoyable, as long as the viewer realizes that it just wasn't meant to be a politically correct show. The A-Team characters were the John Wayne-types of 80s television (though the macho-factor was always leavened with a humorous slant to it). And they were proud of their machismo. If you like these sorts of action-adventure shows, then the A-Team was more of a fun show, than most of its kind.",4,"Fun, if you like action-adventure series.",1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,3204,"['A-Team', 'was', 'basically', 'fun', 'show', 'watch', 'was', 'about', '4', 'Vietnam', 'vets', 'who', 'were', 'framed', 'war', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'escaped', 'military', 'prison', 'wound-up', 'run', 'military', 'officials.They', 'made', 'living', 'Soldiers-of-Fortune', 'meant', 'episode', 'someone', 'hired', 'A-team', 'get', 'one', 'jam', 'doing', 'so', 'had', 'evade', 'pursuers', 'bumbling', 'Col.', 'Lynch', 'first', 'season', 'deadly-determined', 'Col.', 'Decker.The', 'team', 'was', 'led', 'Col.', 'John', 'Hannibal', 'Smith', 'played', 'swaggering', 'relish', 'George', 'Peppard', 'was', 'brains', 'group', 'was', 'known', 'constantly', 'exclaim', 'love', 'when', 'plan', 'together', ""'Actor"", 'Dwight', 'Schultz', 'played', 'Capt', 'Howling', 'Mad', 'Murdock', 'Murdock', 'was', 'indeed', 'certifiably', 'crazy', 'team', 'always', 'had', 'break', 'mental', 'hospitals', 'whenever', 'needed', 'cracker-jack', 'piloting', 'skills', 'could', 'fly', 'anything', 'could', 'be', 'flown', 'was', 'running', 'joke', 'entire', 'series', 'thought', 'got', 'stale', 'while', 'though.Lt', 'Templeton', 'Face', 'Man', 'Peck', 'was', 'devastatingly', 'handsome', 'con-man', 'team', 'Actor', 'Dirk', 'Benedict', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'played', 'Face', 'character', 'smarmy', 'perfection', 'Face', 'Man', 'great', 'looks', 'oily', 'charm', 'always', 'came', 'handy', 'Whenever', 'team', 'needed', 'finesse', 'sticky', 'situation', 'finagle', 'necessities', 'someone', 'was', 'Face', 'Man', 'who', 'always', 'came', 'through.Then', 'was', 'B.A', 'stood', 'Badass', 'Barracus', 'Played', 'muscle-bound', 'menacing', 'Mr.', 'T.', 'was', 'guy', 'nobody', 'dared', 'mess', 'B.A', 'could', 'always', 'be', 'counted', 'whop', 'villain', 'behinds', 'also', 'was', 'team', 'expert', 'mechanic', 'who', 'could', 'fix', 'anything', 'snarling', 'exterior', 'was', 'guy', 'had', 'one', 'big', 'fear-he', 'was', 'terrified', 'flying', 'rest', 'team', 'always', 'had', 'find', 'ingenious', 'ways', 'sedating', 'knowledge', 'putting', 'plane', ""'copter"", 'was', 'running-joke', 'duration', 'series', 'Mad-Murdock', 'mental-hospital-breakout', 'shtick', 'too', 'got', 'stale', 'awhile.This', 'was', 'macho', 'show', 'lots', 'violence', 'shooting', ""'no"", 'gals', 'allowed', 'mentality', 'one', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'regular', 'series', 'was', 'reporter', 'who', 'tagged-along', 'team-on', 'condition', 'not', 'make', 'nuisance', 'herself', 'was', 'always', 'shocked', 'nobody', 'ever', 'got', 'hurt', 'violence', 'seemed', 'be', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'though.Since', 'A-Team', 'always', 'foiled', 'bad-guys', 'episode', 'think', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'so', 'popular', 'great', 'chemistry', 'four', 'A-Team', 'members', 'camaraderie', 'loyalty', 'other', 'really', 'held', 'show', 'disliked', 'intense', 'macho', 'element', 'show', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'own', 'way', 'enjoyable', 'as', 'long', 'viewer', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'show', 'A-Team', 'characters', 'were', 'John', 'Wayne-types', '80s', 'television', 'macho-factor', 'was', 'always', 'leavened', 'humorous', 'slant', 'were', 'proud', 'machismo', 'sorts', 'action-adventure', 'shows', 'then', 'A-Team', 'was', 'more', 'fun', 'show', 'most', 'kind']",The A-Team: Season One

Anyone who grew up in the 80s knows the adventures of fugitive Vietnam vets, Hannibal, Face, B.A. and Murdock.  It's a great memory and also a sad reminder of how lousy television shows are today.  There is absolutely nothing like this on T.V. anymore.  The A-Team do-gooders for hire, but it seems like they're always working Pro Bono.  It makes you wonder how they make any money at all.  The show is sorta like a mix of McGyver, Mission: Impossible and any given Cannon action film from the 80s.Season One introduces us to the crew and sets them off on a series of adventures.  They're pursued by Colonel Lynch, who just can't seem to get his hands on them(even when he does, he can't hold on to them!).  A female reporter named Amy also joins the team.  Tim Dunigan plays Face in the pilot episode, and he's not quite as bad as everyone says, but Dirk is Dirk, and he'll always be Face.The first season doesn't have as much Macgyver-ish stuff as we'd see later on.  The most entertaining aspect of the show is the personalities of the characters and how they interact with one another.  They're all goofballs, and even B.A., who is supposed to be the straight and serious guy, is funny in his attempt to be so serious amongst a group of loonies.  Basically the show can almost be seen more as a comedy than an action show.There are some notable appearances to those who dig cult and B films, like John Saxon, William Smith and Dean Stockwell to name a few.  Also of note to cult horror fans(Karen Shaub especially!), the show was produced by Filipino horror(and Frankie Avalon beach movie)star John Ashley, who also does the narration on the show's intro.Season One isn't regarded as the best season.  The characters are well established, but the show still had some evolving to do.  It's still highly entertaining and has some of my personal favorite episodes.

The two-hour premiere episode, ""Mexican Slayride,"" is a great beginning, despite the fact that the guy playing Face is horrible in the role (Thank God this guy was replaced). Other standout episodes include ""A Small and Deadly War,"" ""Black Day at Bad Rock,"" and the season finale ""A Nice Place to Visit,"" which partially serves as a tribute to the men who served in Vietnam.While the picture is a bit grainy, it does little to detract from this great collection!

627715,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B00005JN80,Taheen Lopez,"[2, 2]","This abbreviated season was truly the best season of them all throughout THE A-TEAM's whole 4-year run on NBC and the season that made Mr. T a superstar and the season that made The A-TEAM an instant smash in the 1980's when it made its debut on NBC in the Winter of 1983 along with the fact that it was interesting seeing Dirk Benedict going from being Starbuck on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA to being Face on THE A-TEAM.In addition; this was also the season when THE A-TEAM was a fivesome & when this show was an over-the-top smash in its honeymoon phase & when THE A-TEAM was hotter, they were slicker, they were sharper looking, plus this was the only full season with sexy newspaper reporter Amy Allen(Melinda Culea)as their sidekick who always tagged along on their missions, which made the show and their missions even more interesting along with the fact that this was the only full season of THE A-TEAM with Amy even though the 1st Season was only a half season since the First Season only had 13 episodes since THE A-TEAM didn't even come out till January of 1983 on NBC for the very first time, plus I found it odd how they often talked about their overzealous Army nemesis Col. Lynch (Bill Lucking) a lot, but had only appeared in 2 episodes, which were the pilot episode(""Mexican Slayride"")and ""One More Time"", yet Lynch was usually no where to be found even when other MP's were obviously chasing and tracking them, which I found kind of odd since Lynch had so-called been chasing Hannibal, Face, and B.A. for over 10 years since the ending of the Vietnam war when they escaped and became fugitives on the lam who were convicted and imprisoned for a crime they could never prove they didn't commit in the first place.In addition to that, this season also explains to us how THE A-TEAM was a show about how Hannibal(George Peppard), B.A.(Mr. T), Face(Dirk Benedict), and Murdock(Dwight Schultz) were all creative Robin Hood style mercaneries for hire who were soldiers of fortune Vietnam vets who specialized in impossible situations where even the police couldn't help, but the A-Team still managed to aid the people in need of serious help who couldn't even be helped out by the police, FBI, etc., even though they were wanted harboring criminals on the run from the law; plus this was the season that shows us how Amy became a member of the team after discovering the A-Team and what they were all about after doing a story on Hannibal, Face, and B.A. when she does a story on them while hiring the A-Team to find her kidnapped reporter friend(William Windom), but Amy becomes the 5th team member at the end of the pilot episode while Lynch continues to unsuccessfully pursue Hannibal, BA, and Face.Additionally, this season also brings back a lot of memories when I was little and lived for watching this show back then, especially since the show became stale and a lot less interesting when Amy was abruptly dropped from the show in November of 1983 when THE A-TEAM went from being a fivesome to only a foursome all of the sudden since Melinda Culea was fired in the mid Fall of 1983 for being too tomboyish & didn't get along well with Peppard either, but then Culea was briefly replaced by Marla Heasley as foxy newspaper reporter(Tawnia Baker)in the Winter of 1984, but Heasley had left the show in the Fall of 1984, due to sexual harrassment issues which brought THE A-TEAM down to a foursome again in its 3rd Season since this show didn't have Amy or Tawnia's beauty, spunkiness, or sweet personality anymore to lighten things up.Therefore, the First Season also seemed to be more genuine and more sophisticated than all the other seasons, so this has and always will be my favorite season of this show and was probably the very best season of them all along with the fact that this season is what made THE A-TEAM such a smash.In fact Universal should've put Amy on the front cover of this DVD box set of THE A-TEAMs 1st Season along with Hannibal, B.A., Face, & Murdock since this was the only full season with Amy in it.The one thing I don't understand about this season was why didn't they have Dirk Benedict playing Tempelton Peck ""Face"" in the pilot episode instead of Tim Dunigan, which only played Face in the ""Mexican Slayride"" episode, but according to my information Tim Dunigan only played Face in the pilot episode, because he was fired since the producers thought Dunigan was too tall and too young looking to be a convincing Vietnam vet and a con-man along with the fact that Dunigan was the tallest and practically the toughest looking co-star on the team, which the producers didn't want.Therefore, the producers of THE A-TEAM decided to replace Tim Dunigan with Dirk Benedict as Tempelton Peck a.k.a. Face since Dirk Benedict was a much better match, since Dirk Benedict wasn't so tall and was a lot more convincing as a Vietnam vet and a smooth-talking con-artist since Dirk Benedict was close to being in his 40's when this show made premiered in January of 1983 along with the fact that the producers wanted Dirk Benedict to portray the role of Face from the very beginning and I personally thought Dirk Benedict made an awesome Tempelton Peck, unlike Tim Dunigan, which made an aweful Tempelton Peck and looked more like an inexperienced wannabe Face.It was also interesting seeing guest stars like*Jack Ging in the ""Small & Deadly War"" episode before he became a part-time co-star on this show as the A-Team's disgruntled nemesis(Gen. Fullbright)in the 4th Season, whom replaced his predecessor Col.Decker(Lance LeGault)in November of 1985*Joanna Kerns in the ""A Nice Place To Visit"" episode before her co-starring days on GROWING PAINS*Andy Robinson in ""The Belly Of The Beast Of Boeing"" episode after his co-starring days on RYANS HOPE and before his co-starring days on STAR TREK:DEEP SPACE NINE*Dean Stockwell in the ""A Small & Deadly War"" episode before his co-starring days on QUANTUM LEAP*Don Stroud in the ""A Nice Place To Visit"" episode before his co-starring days as Capt. Lussen on THE NEW DRAGNET*Rhonda Shear in the ""A Small & Deadly War"" episode before her hosting days on USA's Up All Night*Noble Willingham in the ""Till Death Do Us Part"" episode before his co-starring days on WALKER TEXAS RANGER*Michael Swan in ""The Belly Of The Beast Of A Boeing"" episode before his co-starring days on AS THE WORLD TURNS and SANTA BARBARA*Ismael Carlo in the ""A Small & Deady War"" episode before his co-starring days on DAYS OF OUR LIVES and SANTA BARBARASomething else I noticed about this season was they had used a clip scene from the movie AIRPLANE in the ""Belly Of The Beast Of Boeing"" episode and used a clip scene from the movie DEATH WISH in ""The Out-Of-Towners"" episode just like they used a clip scene from the movie SPRING BREAK in The A-Teams ""Bullets & Bikinis"" episode in the Autumn of 1984.This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when NBC's motto was ""Just Watch Us Now"" and to when I used to watch THE A-TEAM sometimes even twice every Tuesday between 6PM-7PM on KYEL, which was the NBC affiliate for Yuma, AZ and El Centro, CA at the time and then again at 8PM on KNBC, which is the NBC affiliate for Los Angeles, which I did frequently since I was living in the Imperial Valley at the time, which is a small secluded desert community with very little to do for fun or entertainment.So I think anybody who religiously watched THE A-TEAM on NBC every Tuesday night back in the mid 1980's would definetely agree with me on all this.",5,Best Season Of Them All,1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,7506,"['abbreviated',
