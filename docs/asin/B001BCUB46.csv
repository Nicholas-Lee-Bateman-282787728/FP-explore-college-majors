1171605,A3NE5KEHD57Q6S,B001BCUB46,"Admiralu ""admiralu""","[120, 121]","I was a fan of A Haunting when it ran on the Discovery channel and I was very sad to see them cancel this show. A Haunting was produced by New Dominion Pictures, who did the FBI Files and the New Detectives series that also ran on Discovery. For those who are not familiar with the show, A Haunting covers real life experiences of encounters with the paranormal. Interviews with people who experienced the paranormal activity are included. Some appear in shadow and the show is augmented by reenactments of their stories. What sets this show apart from others is the high quality production values and interview with both the individuals and the paranormal investigators who assisted them and shed light into their craft. The various methods of scientific study and differing types of hauntings, demons, phantoms and etc. are fascinating. This show is scary, (scarier than many horror movies, it was so well produced) there is no gore, but the atmosphere is extremely creepy. If you watch some of these episodes late at night, they can give people bad dreams, as seveal of my coworkers will attest. It is so well done, that the actors simply blend into the roles. There are four seasons in this set. I will share some of my favorites.Season 1Hell House - A demon story featuring the renowned Ed and Lorraine Warren. One of the scariest shows of the entire series.Season 2Gateway to Hell - A haunted nightclub built on the site of an old slaughterhouse by the Licking River which flows true north. Another one of the scariest of the series.Hungry Ghosts - A house in Taiwan that was built to curse its inhabitants. Another series scariest.Where Demons Dwell - A young boy is tormented by a deomonic presence and Ed and Lorraine Warren are called in. Very creepy!Ghost Solider - A haunted photograph complicates a lonley woman's life when she finds not one but two spirits.Season 3Fear House - A house that sends many of its occupants fleeing. One former resident attempts to help another family before its too late.The Unleashed - A man plays with witchcraft and suffers the consequences. Very scary.Wheatsheaf Horror - A a spirit haunting a pub in Britain attacks those within and a psychic faces her own fears.The Possessed - A paranormal investigator becomes possessed herself and seeks help from legendary demonolgist John Zaffis. One of the the scariest of the entire series.Season 4The Apartment - The spirits of a drug dealer and his victim haunt a young couple and terrify a psychic.Where Evil Lurks - A family discovers that their house is a portal to hell. When one demon is banished another takes its place. Another scary one.Casa De Los Muertos - A famous musician with the gift of sense battles a deadly ghost. I won't give away the twist of this story. Another creepy tale.Legend Trippers - Teens are fascinated by an eerie legend in an old cemetery. Sereral groups who experienced the haunting are profiled.A Haunting is an excellent show that will make you think twice about how to perceive the world. It is also interesting to see how the people handled what they experienced. Some turned to their faith, others turned away and many who did not believe in the paranormal now do.",5,Scary and Thought Provoking Show without Gore,1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,3194,"['was', 'fan', 'A', 'Haunting', 'when', 'ran', 'Discovery', 'channel', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'see', 'cancel', 'show', 'Haunting', 'was', 'produced', 'New', 'Dominion', 'Pictures', 'who', 'did', 'FBI', 'Files', 'New', 'Detectives', 'series', 'also', 'ran', 'Discovery', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'show', 'A', 'Haunting', 'covers', 'real', 'life', 'experiences', 'encounters', 'paranormal', 'Interviews', 'people', 'who', 'experienced', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'are', 'included', 'appear', 'shadow', 'show', 'augmented', 'reenactments', 'stories', 'What', 'show', 'apart', 'others', 'high', 'quality', 'production', 'values', 'interview', 'individuals', 'paranormal', 'investigators', 'who', 'assisted', 'shed', 'light', 'craft', 'various', 'methods', 'scientific', 'study', 'differing', 'types', 'hauntings', 'demons', 'phantoms', 'etc', 'are', 'fascinating', 'show', 'scary', 'scarier', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'produced', 'gore', 'atmosphere', 'extremely', 'creepy', 'watch', 'episodes', 'late', 'night', 'can', 'give', 'people', 'bad', 'dreams', 'seveal', 'coworkers', 'will', 'attest', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'actors', 'simply', 'blend', 'roles', 'are', 'four', 'seasons', 'set', 'will', 'share', 'favorites.Season', '1Hell', 'House', 'demon', 'story', 'featuring', 'renowned', 'Ed', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'One', 'scariest', 'shows', 'entire', 'series.Season', '2Gateway', 'Hell', 'haunted', 'nightclub', 'built', 'site', 'old', 'slaughterhouse', 'Licking', 'River', 'true', 'north', 'one', 'scariest', 'series.Hungry', 'Ghosts', 'house', 'Taiwan', 'was', 'built', 'curse', 'inhabitants', 'series', 'scariest.Where', 'Demons', 'Dwell', 'young', 'boy', 'tormented', 'deomonic', 'presence', 'Ed', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'are', 'called', 'Very', 'creepy', 'Ghost', 'Solider', 'haunted', 'photograph', 'lonley', 'woman', 'life', 'when', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'spirits.Season', '3Fear', 'House', 'house', 'many', 'occupants', 'fleeing', 'One', 'former', 'resident', 'attempts', 'help', 'family', 'too', 'late.The', 'Unleashed', 'man', 'witchcraft', 'consequences', 'Very', 'scary.Wheatsheaf', 'Horror', 'A', 'spirit', 'haunting', 'pub', 'Britain', 'attacks', 'psychic', 'own', 'fears.The', 'Possessed', 'paranormal', 'investigator', 'becomes', 'possessed', 'seeks', 'help', 'legendary', 'demonolgist', 'John', 'Zaffis', 'One', 'scariest', 'entire', 'series.Season', '4The', 'Apartment', 'spirits', 'drug', 'dealer', 'victim', 'haunt', 'young', 'couple', 'terrify', 'psychic.Where', 'Evil', 'Lurks', 'family', 'house', 'portal', 'hell', 'When', 'one', 'demon', 'banished', 'place', 'scary', 'one.Casa', 'De', 'Los', 'Muertos', 'famous', 'musician', 'gift', 'sense', 'deadly', 'ghost', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'twist', 'story', 'creepy', 'tale.Legend', 'Trippers', 'Teens', 'are', 'fascinated', 'eerie', 'legend', 'old', 'cemetery', 'Sereral', 'groups', 'who', 'experienced', 'haunting', 'are', 'profiled.A', 'Haunting', 'excellent', 'show', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'twice', 'about', 'how', 'perceive', 'world', 'also', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'handled', 'what', 'experienced', 'turned', 'faith', 'others', 'turned', 'away', 'many', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'believe', 'paranormal', 'now', 'do']",A Haunting - Seasons 1-4

I am thrilled to be able to buy it at this price becuase if you bought it through Discovery Channel, you would pay alot more for just one or two episodes.  Here you get 39 and I would also recommend getting ""A Haunting in Connecticut"" and ""A Haunting in Georgia"" 2 DVD set narrated by Tony Call.  They were the first episodes put out by the Discovery Channel.  I never believed in the paranormal until I saw these shows, but they made a believer out of me.  You begin to realize that there really is a life after death and that there is such a thing as evil spirits.  If there are evil spirits, then there must also be good spirits. When you realize these things and that the world of the dead can interact with ours, it is a moment of revelation.

I like the way the stories are told through a narrator who tells the story as a whole while you are viewing either the actual witnesses or the actors who are playing them. This is done very proffesional and you are instantly hooked on the Haunting and Characters. This reminds me a lot of Unsolved Mysteries because it has the addition of the narrator. It is better quality than Ghost Hunters or even Paranormal State, it is not an investigation as those shows are but a Paranormal Story, and of course then the Investigators get called in but it is told as a story, it is especially enjoyable to see Lorraine Warren. The major difference between This Show and GH or PS is that A Haunting is viewed as a story rather thtan watching people asking questions in the dark.

1171618,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B001BCUB46,Howard M. Kindel,"[5, 5]","Whether you accept the events being portrayed in the series at face value or think they're the product of over-active imaginations, the result is the same: you'll thoroughly enjoy the show.  If you're skeptical of everything paranormal, then think of the show as something like Supernatural, only presented in a docu-drama format; you don't have to believe it to enjoy it.  The production values are superb; the acting and narration are excellent; and, best of all, the atmosphere is genuinely eerie. Even the comments by the actual people who experienced the events is woven into the story skillfully enough that they don't detract from the building suspense.  The only criticism I would make (and, believe me, it's a very mild criticism) is that the show has a certain peculiarity indiginous to Discovery/History Channel shows: the place in the show that would clearly have come after the ""commercial break"" sometimes recaps what was already shown.  But even that's handled with enough subtlety that you don't get the feeling the producers think you may have already forgotten how the show started.What I truly like best about this show is that it's perfect for anytime I want to watch something but can't quite make up my mind what I'm in the mood for.  Since I no longer watch TV but only DVD's, it substitutes very well for just turning on the TV and taking pot luck - because every episode is complete in itself; and, even though the running theme is a haunted house, you don't have to place the episode you're watching in the context of the whole series.

I feel this show provides all of that! Offering real tales of people who have been through real life hauntings! Some of these hauntings are of friendly ghosts co-existing with the families and then there are the ghost stories of those families tormented by evil demons and poltergeists!

As the favored go-to duo from the paranormal 70s on I realize my neighbors (and subsequent protege Zaffis) carried lots of cred (not to mention all sorts of baggage).  But half a dozen episodes where they come to the rescue?! One cringes every time they step over another threshold to pronounce the place riddled with E-vil. What Dr. William Roll was to Unsolved Mysteries (I also recommend their ghost episodes DVD set - see reviews),Ed (God rest his soul) and Lorraine W too predictably were to A Haunting's producers.Sadly there will be no new seasons of this quite respectable if rather simplistic but charmingly low-rent series.  Overall the stories reveal far more than they do separately - which I should have more clearly stated as my original point concerning pattern recognition.Some rather droll examples:Gee, dad, you never seem to notice the stuff we do, yet you've been acting awfully weird lately.  Or hows about: There's just something odder and more threatening about those shadowy looking things - I thought we were just dealing with some lonely folks who haven't reconciled themselves to passing on.  Finally, that perennial favorite: Gosh, after months if not years living in this creepy place while trying to avoid accepting the reality of our situation we couldn't help wondering why things just kept going wrong in our lives, our attitudes and behavior until it suddenly dawned - hey, we're really being influenced by... some kinda haunting!************************************************************************************Repeat viewings of most of these episodes prove quite worthwhile.Particularly effective and deserving of special mention is the editing of sounds and images - through which most of the unsettling atmosphere and scares are conjured.Techniques which, in most current knockoff horror junk, usually appear way too lookatme MTV gimmicky or Ghost House schlockish: electronically distorted whispers, groans, shriekings and creakings, as well as the whole modern arsenal of flashy grotesque cutting, defocusing and sickly color temperature tricks, are actually put to quite effective and even tasteful use.  Much credit is due the directors, production and technical crews, I am sure they have gone unsung for far too long. Likewise much of the acting, which is more effective because of the rather commonplace casting (which is not to disparage their often praiseworthy efforts).  One particularly noteworthy presence was the fellow who portrayed the psychic in Dark Forest.As far as the often criticised similarity between many of these stories: pattern recognition. kiddies!  The truth of any event, especially those which appear anomolous, only becomes evident when it is repeated often enough to reveal its inner workings to those with the objectivity and true skepticism to acknowledge it.  Which, of course, is not to say that we are talking about documentaries here.  Every haunting is obviously jazzed up, simplified, reconfigured, even dumbed down for general audience consumption.  But overall they are quite worthwhile and, for those of us not already so fried by the usual amped-up teen horror fare, genuinely spooky.  Maybe in time the series can be brought back from the dead.

There is very little gore, but with the excellent execution of tension and the impending doom atmosphere, it makes the 45 minutes seem like a feature length movie.2] The ghost stories are the best stories.3] The music and photography are top notch4] Most of the acting is very believeable. Some of the actors appear in different episodes playing different characters5] the interview segments with the actual people whom the story happened to.The cons:1] I wasn't too crazy about the demonic posession stories. There are too many movies and shows that basically tell the same story. Person messes with the occult. person becomes posessed by a demon. Person needs an exorcist.2] When evidence is mentioned that was gathered in the REAL story, it is not used in the re-enactments. Instead, faked stuff is used there. Only in one story that I can remember, they showed an actual photo that the real person the story happened to take.3] A few of the actors didn't act well or didn't fit the part they played.4] This is presented a ""true"" stories. Although very well executed, and without showing much of the actual evidence that is mentioned by the interviewed people, one wonders how much was actually dramatized for TV. I also wondered, since some of the stories are pulled from memory, how much was actual occurance and how much was distorted by time?5] Some of the acting is season four was really bad.A few things I noticed:1] a few actors appear in more than one episode. Sort of like the ""Not-ready-for-real-horro-players""2]Some of the locations are reused in multiple stories. Most stories involving a basement use the same basement.

I enjoy seeing the locations I'm familiar with. Though I am a skeptic, most of these episodes are unusually scary, with reasonably good acting- especially from the juvenile actors. It's not the typical scenery-chewing melodrama and it's accomplished without the usual blood and gore. (The Warrens are/were rather creepy if you've met them or seen them in person!) This series is right up there with Twilight Zone with scenes that will linger in your head long after you first saw them. I realize that much of the drama is controversial or even imagined and some unfortunate people might even be mentally ill- but the intent to present the episodes as believeable is masterful. The ""budget"" effects are rather clever (see what you can do without Industrial Light & Magic, ha!) and Tony Call's narration is not just a means to save dollars. The editing and directing is exceptional for this genre- so easy to fall back on hackneyed, cheesy elements. Too bad that this series is no longer in production- I like the fact that several of the stories take place in the past 10 years and not decades ago with ""contemporary"" ""ghosts""- like druggies and depressed teenagers!",5,Really Frightening At Times!

I picked this four season collection up at Sam's Club a while back when they had it and only recently began to watch the show again. This show is just as entertaining as it was the first time. Now I suppose you have to admit that the stories are quite the dramatization. I'd say it's rather rare to see ghosts, demons, poltergeists, to see objects moving, doors opening or slamming, etc. I also don't think that exorcisms are as common as they seem to be in the show. I was hoping to see actual paranormal investigators dismissing the stories as dramatic rubbish but there don't seem to be any such entries for this series.

When it got it and watched the first disc I was really shocked to find it was not captioned or subtitled. I am almost deaf and really need them to fully understand what is going on. The discs are poor quality and really look grainy.

Every case is unique in themselves and is something we can all learn from and know what to avoid. You will also be able to see how each of these haunting cases are solved, although not all of them are successfully solved or banished. Many affilicted victims end up fleeing the scene of contact, and most cases end with banishing or cleansing rituals of some sort. I hope to see a more powerful DVD series that solves these things permanently. To go indepth into solving such cases would take greater time and follow-ups with each case. With over 3 dozen cases to learn from, you will no doubt be chilled with each case.Don't become the next unfortunate victim the next time you are tempted by the Dark Side!If you find reading books on this subject matter too tedious for whatever reason, get these DVDs!To the producers of these series, kudos to you guys!Please produce more of these case studies and provide solutions for each case.",5,"Skeptics of the paranormal, watch this!

1171634,A1K0LPMMIU2UV6,B001BCUB46,S. Moon,"[2, 2]","My sister got this for my Dad for Christmas a few years ago for $10 at one of those Big Lots type places and because of the price I never borrowed it thinking it was low quality.  I borrowed it one Halloween and wasn't disappointed, it is close to Unsolved Mysteries but each episode is just short of 50 min.  It is in my Halloween rotation now.The box and cases themselves are nothing special, it's a plain box with each disk in a slim case, but I sometimes think DVD seasons are a little too fancy and take up a little too much space.  This is a 9 DVD set and for the size it takes up on a shelf it's great.A few things that this set didn't do well on:Video quality.  It gets a little grainy at times, not as bad as some DVDs but you really notice it if you have a HDTV.Chapter Markers.  One advantage about DVDs is the ability to skip intros so after the first one you don't have to see the opening for every episode.  Season 1, 2, and 3 had every episode as one chapter so if you hit skip then it went to the next episode.  Season 4 got it correct and when you hit skip once it went right into the story, skipping the intro.  I know some people don't care about this but when I watch TV I binge on it, watching a few DVDs or a few TV episodes on my Tivo device so skipping is important to me.Overall I think the acting and locations were alright but I took off one star for quality and one star for chapter markers.  I would still recommend it even with these small flaws.EDIT:  I want to add this is not the complete set, there are two movie length episodes that led to the production to these seasons.  They are 'A HAUNTING IN CONNECTICUT' and 'A HAUNTING IN GEORGIA'.  One of them was made into a major motion picture so make sure you get the 'documentary' ones instead.  They come as a double feature DVD on Amazon, only $9.99, I'm going to get that and see what it's like.  I can't say much for them as I haven't watched them but I'm going to get them before next Halloween and update this review.",3,Can't recommend this enough!,1263859200,"01 19, 2010",2010,2006,"['sister', 'got', 'Dad', 'Christmas', 'few', 'years', 'ago', '10', 'one', 'Big', 'Lots', 'type', 'places', 'price', 'never', 'borrowed', 'thinking', 'was', 'low', 'quality', 'borrowed', 'one', 'Halloween', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'close', 'Unsolved', 'Mysteries', 'episode', 'just', 'short', '50', 'min', 'Halloween', 'rotation', 'now.The', 'box', 'cases', 'are', 'nothing', 'special', 'plain', 'box', 'disk', 'slim', 'case', 'sometimes', 'think', 'DVD', 'seasons', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'fancy', 'take', 'up', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'space', '9', 'DVD', 'set', 'size', 'up', 'shelf', 'great.A', 'few', 'things', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'Video', 'quality', 'little', 'grainy', 'times', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'DVDs', 'really', 'notice', 'have', 'HDTV.Chapter', 'Markers', 'One', 'advantage', 'DVDs', 'ability', 'skip', 'intros', 'so', 'first', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'opening', 'episode', 'Season', '1', '2', '3', 'had', 'episode', 'one', 'chapter', 'so', 'hit', 'skip', 'then', 'went', 'next', 'episode', 'Season', '4', 'got', 'correct', 'when', 'hit', 'skip', 'went', 'right', 'story', 'skipping', 'intro', 'know', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'when', 'watch', 'TV', 'binge', 'watching', 'few', 'DVDs', 'few', 'TV', 'episodes', 'Tivo', 'device', 'so', 'skipping', 'important', 'me.Overall', 'think', 'acting', 'locations', 'were', 'alright', 'took', 'off', 'one', 'star', 'quality', 'one', 'star', 'chapter', 'markers', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'even', 'small', 'flaws.EDIT', 'want', 'add', 'not', 'complete', 'set', 'are', 'two', 'movie', 'length', 'led', 'production', 'seasons', 'are', 'A', 'HAUNTING', 'IN', 'CONNECTICUT', 'HAUNTING', 'IN', 'GEORGIA', 'One', 'was', 'made', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'so', 'make', 'sure', 'get', ""'documentary"", 'ones', 'instead', 'come', 'double', 'feature', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'only', '9.99', ""'m"", 'going', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', ""'m"", 'going', 'get', 'next', 'Halloween', 'update', 'review']",A Haunting - Seasons 1-4

1171636,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001BCUB46,Z Hayes,"[67, 68]","Discovery Channel's ""A Haunting"" Seasons 1-4 contains some of the creepiest stories I've ever seen reenacted on screen, all of which are based on actual events. The series is in a docu-drama format, i.e. the reenactments are done using actors, props etc, but these scenes are then interspersed with interviews with those who actually experienced the hauntings, paranormal investigators, etc. This format makes for a compelling series that keeps viewers engaged throughout the various episodes.The episode list is as follows:Season 1Hell HouseThe Haunting of SummerwindEchoes from the GraveCursedDarkness FollowsLake Club HorrorGateway to HellThe DiabolicalSeason 2Demon ChildSallie's HouseGhost SoldierWhere Demons DwellHouse of the DeadHungry GhostsDark ForestA Haunting in FloridaSeason 3Fear HouseThe AtticHidden TerrorThe UnleashedA Haunting in IrelandThe ForgottenThe Wheatsheaf HorrorThe PossessedThe PresenceThe Dark SideSeason 4Dark WrathThe AwakeningThe CallingThe ApartmentSpirits of the DeadWhere Evil LurksSpellboundEchoes of the PastGhost HunterStalked by EvilCasa De Los MuertosMonster in the ApartmentLegend TrippersI have various favorites in the series, from Seasons 1-4.The production values are above average, and though the special effects are not extraordinary, the episodes are highly atmospheric, conveying a real sense of menace and dread, and inciting sympathy for the victims.
