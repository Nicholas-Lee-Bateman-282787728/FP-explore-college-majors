It was much better than I anticipated. Have you ever been odd man out in a life situation? This young man falls into the sweet job spot accidently, It is guaranteed to give you a laugh and a cry from time to time. It really is a today type story with so many people in the world out of work. I enjoyed it and recommend it as a different type of movie with a great cast. Being the kind of loser guy, he makes his parents, especially his mother, when he lands this great job...how does he tell them it is a mistake? He can't. He kind of likes where he is at wearing suits and all. On the other hand, he feels guilty for the deception, but it wasn't his fault....it was the fault of, well I do not give away plots. Buy it or watch it on one of the networks that offer viewing. You will enjoy it! I keep checking Amazon's list of Korean dramas, etc. They are doing a great job keeping up and the prices are good too.",4,Odd man out!,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,993,"['fun', 'movie', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'reviews', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'anticipated', 'Have', 'ever', 'been', 'odd', 'man', 'out', 'life', 'situation', 'young', 'man', 'sweet', 'job', 'spot', 'accidently', 'guaranteed', 'give', 'laugh', 'cry', 'time', 'time', 'really', 'today', 'type', 'story', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'world', 'work', 'enjoyed', 'recommend', 'different', 'type', 'movie', 'great', 'cast', 'Being', 'kind', 'loser', 'guy', 'parents', 'especially', 'mother', 'when', 'great', 'job', 'how', 'tell', 'mistake', 'ca', ""n't"", 'kind', 'likes', 'where', 'wearing', 'suits', 'other', 'hand', 'guilty', 'deception', 'was', ""n't"", 'fault', '.it', 'was', 'fault', 'well', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'plots', 'Buy', 'watch', 'one', 'networks', 'offer', 'viewing', 'will', 'enjoy', 'keep', 'checking', 'Amazon', 'list', 'Korean', 'dramas', 'etc', 'are', 'doing', 'great', 'job', 'keeping', 'up', 'prices', 'are', 'good', 'too']",Super Rookie
1114639,A24TEIDZP9ORWG,B000XPRMCQ,Camera newbie,"[0, 0]","The moral tale of a loser slacker (Eric Mun) who keeps triumphing in the corporate world.  Undaunted, nave, lucky, and operating out of the box for success at any task thrown at him by snobbish bosses while the corporate world is stuck in textbook formulas, CYA, inside connections, and ambiguous morals.  Funny stuff.  A pointed remark toward the corporate world and its snobbish elitism.",5,Yes He Can,1393113600,"02 23, 2014",2014,389,"['moral', 'tale', 'loser', 'slacker', 'Eric', 'Mun', 'who', 'triumphing', 'corporate', 'world', 'Undaunted', 'nave', 'lucky', 'operating', 'box', 'success', 'task', 'thrown', 'snobbish', 'bosses', 'corporate', 'world', 'stuck', 'textbook', 'formulas', 'CYA', 'connections', 'ambiguous', 'morals', 'Funny', 'stuff', 'pointed', 'remark', 'corporate', 'world', 'snobbish', 'elitism']",Super Rookie

At first I wasn't sure if I was going to buy it because the description sounded lame, so I watched a short vid on youtube to see if it looked interesting. And it did. I bought it and started watching it with my boyfriend (who doesn't watch kdramas). Oddly enough, my boyfriend loves this show. And I love it too, though its not my favorite (Birth of the Rich is).To sum it up without giving too much away, a loser of a guy is a loser at 30 years old and applies at this big company who only hire the best accidentally gets hired and theres lots of laughs and some sad moments, but not overdone.I would recommend this to anyone who likes kdramas or even just likes foreign movies.",5,Funny and addicting,1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,704,"['bought', 'whim', 'first', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'going', 'buy', 'description', 'sounded', 'lame', 'watched', 'short', 'vid', 'youtube', 'see', 'looked', 'interesting', 'did', 'bought', 'started', 'watching', 'boyfriend', 'who', ""n't"", 'watch', 'kdramas', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'boyfriend', 'show', 'love', 'too', 'not', 'favorite', 'Birth', 'Rich', '.To', 'sum', 'up', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'loser', 'guy', 'loser', '30', 'years', 'old', 'big', 'company', 'who', 'only', 'best', 'accidentally', 'hired', 'lots', 'laughs', 'sad', 'moments', 'not', 'overdone.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'kdramas', 'even', 'just', 'foreign', 'movies']",Super Rookie

The storyline is simple, &#34;rags to lucking-out&#34; because of a computer error. I enjoyed the way the character - the Super Rookie - stayed grounded no matter the mean digs and attacks on his person by the upper class and the accidental successes he achieved.
