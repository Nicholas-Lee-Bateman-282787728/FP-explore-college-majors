847301,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,B0002VGTX4,drkhimxz,"[0, 0]","I find the reviews by others who know the Dance, its techniques and comparative performances, interesting. Here I simply offer the comments of one who has enjoyed some seasons live and more through DVD. Just how one learns to perform the magic and how different companies have approached the library of choreography, is beyond my knowledge.Speaking only as one such member of the audience to others who may be similar in approach, I can recommend what is done by Baryshnikov solo and with two different partners as first rate entertainment. In 1976 he was an experienced dancer with considerable experience in some of the best companies. What we see in these brief excerpts hits the spot. As to Kirkland who shares the spotlight with him more than the other partner, it is hard to see her as she is, rather than as we imagine she was feeling in these, her years of horror (as described in the first volume of her memoirs). To me she often seems tentative in her physical contacts with Baryshnikov and in carrying out her movements. I am happy to refer that problem to the more knowledgeable.As I say, it is a joyful experience. On the other hand, it is a very brief one. Four short numbers, no commentary, which I clocked at about 40 minutes, the official time being 5o minutes. Whatever, at less than a bargain price, it is a comparatively expensive disc.",5,Brief Encounter,1276732800,"06 17, 2010",2010,1356,"['find', 'reviews', 'others', 'who', 'know', 'Dance', 'techniques', 'comparative', 'performances', 'interesting', 'Here', 'simply', 'offer', 'comments', 'one', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'seasons', 'live', 'more', 'DVD', 'Just', 'how', 'one', 'perform', 'magic', 'how', 'different', 'companies', 'have', 'approached', 'library', 'choreography', 'knowledge.Speaking', 'only', 'one', 'such', 'member', 'audience', 'others', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'similar', 'approach', 'can', 'recommend', 'what', 'done', 'Baryshnikov', 'solo', 'two', 'different', 'partners', 'first', 'rate', 'entertainment', '1976', 'was', 'experienced', 'dancer', 'considerable', 'experience', 'best', 'companies', 'What', 'see', 'brief', 'excerpts', 'spot', 'Kirkland', 'who', 'shares', 'spotlight', 'more', 'other', 'partner', 'hard', 'see', 'rather', 'imagine', 'was', 'feeling', 'years', 'horror', 'described', 'first', 'volume', 'memoirs', 'often', 'tentative', 'physical', 'contacts', 'Baryshnikov', 'carrying', 'out', 'movements', 'am', 'happy', 'refer', 'problem', 'more', 'knowledgeable.As', 'say', 'joyful', 'experience', 'other', 'hand', 'very', 'brief', 'one', 'Four', 'short', 'numbers', 'commentary', 'clocked', '40', 'minutes', 'official', 'time', 'being', '5o', 'minutes', 'Whatever', 'less', 'bargain', 'price', 'comparatively', 'expensive', 'disc']",N/A

One of the requirements of the competition is that a new (or modern?) piece be performed, and so we have ""Vestris"".

847303,AUX9KZUUB3YCE,B0002VGTX4,R. Nicholson,"[2, 2]","Another historical gem from Kultur; this DVD features Mikhail Baryshnikov's 1976 American debut at the Wolf Trap Theatre.Because this was 'live recording', the disc is quite short; it is only 50 minutes long. However it is filled with an exhibition of talent and grace that could only be Baryshnikov. There are four Baryshnikov pieces featured on this DVD; two Pas de Deuxs with Gesley Kirkland, one with Marianna Tcherkassky and a solo dance.This disc features Baryshnikov at is prime, and while watching him, you begin to understand the fervor around his arrival to the west. His spins and leaps appear to happen in slow motion...virtually effortless; his 'hang-time' could easily be compared to that of basketball's Michael Jordan.The only minor concern about this disc is from a technical point of view; age has made the film somewhat grainy and the sound is in mono. However this is a small price to pay to be able to see one of the best, at his best.One other observations, when watching Gesley Kirkland in the two dances she performed with Mikhail I noticed two things, first, that she appeared somewhat shaky (nervous perhaps?...who could blame her) and second, how incredible thin she was (every bone, every muscle defined). Then during the credits there was a note, written by Gesley, warning young girls of the the dangers of anorexia and how it could affect their performance in ballet. I thought this was an incredibly thoughtful, honest and revealing  gesture on her part.Conclusion:An archival treasure... featuring Mikhail Baryshnikov's at his American debut.

847304,A3I2TTBNFGBXTP,B0002VGTX4,Robert Levonian,"[1, 2]","Three numbers make up this video. The first is ""Le Spectre de la Rose"", Fokin's choreographic bonbon originally created by the mythic Vaslav Nijinsky and Tamara Karsavina. Baryshnikov`s dancing is academic, in the sense that he dances ""correctly"", but without emotion. His partnering is merely elegant, when it should be rapturous. There are other interpretations on video, and Nureyev's and Farukh Ruzimatov's are warmer and more passionate than Mr. Baryshnikov's. Unfortunately, the public applauds at the wrong places. About two minutes before the end there`s a pause in the music - a false ""ending"", in fact - and the audience bursts in applause, so the first bars of the incoming music are lost. A pity...""Vestris"" is a solo created by Leonid Jacobson for Baryshnikov in 1968. There's a black and white documentary showing an almost adolescent Baryshnikov getting a gold medal at an international competition in Moscow after having danced this piece. Vestris was a celebrated XVIII century dancer, and the coreography - rather ""modern"" by Soviet standards - alternates Vestris's recollections and actual solos, as he remembers his past life and career. In my opinion this is the best part of the video. Baryshnikov has to perform as a dancer, doing delicate court dances, and as an actor, conveying Vestris's inner anguishes.The two roles - dancer or actor - are separated by a pause in the music and a sort of pantomime: Mr. Baryshnikov makes a movement around his face, as if he were removing a mask. The audience, not understanding, laughs...The final number is a pas de deux from ""Coppelia"", coreographed by Arthur de Saint-L&eacute;on in 1870. It is, perhaps, Baryshnikov's best performance as a ""classical"" dancer on this video. As it is a formal pas de deux, his elegant reserve is well-suited to the choreography. His partnering is discrete in the adagio but  adequately brilliant in the variation.There are set only for the first number - sparse and insignificant - and costumes are conventional",3,Baryshnikov in three different roles,1106092800,"01 19, 2005",2005,2009,"['Three', 'numbers', 'make', 'up', 'video', 'first', 'Le', 'Spectre', 'de', 'la', 'Rose', 'Fokin', 'choreographic', 'bonbon', 'originally', 'created', 'mythic', 'Vaslav', 'Nijinsky', 'Tamara', 'Karsavina', 'Baryshnikov', 's', 'dancing', 'academic', 'sense', 'correctly', 'emotion', 'partnering', 'merely', 'elegant', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'rapturous', 'are', 'other', 'interpretations', 'video', 'Nureyev', 'Farukh', 'Ruzimatov', 'are', 'warmer', 'more', 'passionate', 'Mr.', 'Baryshnikov', 'Unfortunately', 'public', 'applauds', 'wrong', 'places', 'two', 'minutes', 'end', 'there', 's', 'pause', 'music', 'false', 'ending', 'fact', 'audience', 'bursts', 'applause', 'first', 'bars', 'incoming', 'music', 'are', 'lost', 'pity', 'Vestris', 'solo', 'created', 'Leonid', 'Jacobson', 'Baryshnikov', '1968', 'black', 'white', 'documentary', 'showing', 'almost', 'adolescent', 'Baryshnikov', 'getting', 'gold', 'medal', 'international', 'competition', 'Moscow', 'having', 'danced', 'piece', 'Vestris', 'was', 'celebrated', 'XVIII', 'century', 'dancer', 'coreography', 'rather', 'modern', 'Soviet', 'standards', 'Vestris', 'recollections', 'actual', 'solos', 'past', 'life', 'career', 'opinion', 'best', 'part', 'video', 'Baryshnikov', 'perform', 'dancer', 'doing', 'delicate', 'court', 'dances', 'actor', 'conveying', 'Vestris', 'inner', 'anguishes.The', 'two', 'roles', 'dancer', 'actor', 'are', 'separated', 'pause', 'music', 'sort', 'pantomime', 'Mr.', 'Baryshnikov', 'movement', 'face', 'were', 'removing', 'mask', 'audience', 'not', 'understanding', 'final', 'number', 'pas', 'de', 'deux', 'Coppelia', 'coreographed', 'Arthur', 'Saint-L', 'eacute', '1870', 'perhaps', 'Baryshnikov', 'best', 'performance', 'classical', 'dancer', 'video', 'formal', 'pas', 'deux', 'elegant', 'reserve', 'well-suited', 'choreography', 'partnering', 'discrete', 'adagio', 'adequately', 'brilliant', 'variation.There', 'are', 'set', 'only', 'first', 'number', 'sparse', 'insignificant', 'costumes', 'are', 'conventional']",N/A

He is partnered with a scary Gelsey Kirkland, deep in her anorexic period.  Although it hurts to see her so thin and shaky, Mr. Baryshnikov partners her with surety.
