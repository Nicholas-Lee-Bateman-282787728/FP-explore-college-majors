767806,A3IAP2JMTP5YBN,B0000ARD7R,"adriana ""alisa""","[6, 6]","Blue Car is a small little indie film that is short in length, and has no action, excitement, or mindblowing climaxes.It is however very well acted,sharply written, and quietly strong.The plot is as simple as they come.Meg (Agnes Bruckner) is a quiet,lonely 16 year old girl who dreams of being a poet.She lives with her stressed single mother(Margaret Colin), and her emotionally damaged younger sister.Her life is bland and rather joyless.Enter Mr. Auster (David Strathairn), Meg's English teacher who regognizes Meg's blossoming talent, and sympathizes with her lonliness.In Mr. Auster Meg finds comfort and a mentor, and needless to say their relationship develops into something more than just a student teaCher interaction.Like I said before this film is very short, and despite dealing with sadness and tough subjects Blue Car never gets melodramatic or overwrought.It had a tight script which held everything together well and great acting all around.Agnes Bruckner is very,very good in her lead role.Subtle and quietly intense,sullen and full of angst-she nails this role and captures your heart without ever milking for sympathy.I'm still wondering as to why she hasn't gotten more acclaim-she's a very talented young actress.David Strathairn was perfect in his role.Strathairn is a smart enough actor to give his character enough dimension and complexity that you aren't able to completely hate him in moments that you should.And Margaret Colin, as Meg's mother was just great as the weary mother.All the acting felt very natural, and understated enough to provide the movie with earnestness and an honest quality missing in many films. The denoument was a little harsh, but totally realistic.And by the end of the film, despite it being realistic and not partcularly &quot;feel-good&quot;, I did feel a quiet hope for our heroine.Blue Car isn't going to change your life, but its a very fresh little film with great acting and a quiet honesty that isn't found in many films nowadays.Recommended.",4,A small film with quiet strength,1087516800,"06 18, 2004",2004,2007,"['Blue', 'Car', 'small', 'little', 'indie', 'film', 'short', 'length', 'action', 'excitement', 'mindblowing', 'climaxes.It', 'however', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'sharply', 'written', 'quietly', 'strong.The', 'plot', 'as', 'simple', 'come.Meg', 'Agnes', 'Bruckner', 'quiet', 'lonely', '16', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'being', 'poet.She', 'stressed', 'single', 'mother', 'Margaret', 'Colin', 'emotionally', 'damaged', 'younger', 'sister.Her', 'life', 'bland', 'rather', 'joyless.Enter', 'Mr.', 'Auster', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Meg', 'English', 'teacher', 'who', 'Meg', 'blossoming', 'talent', 'lonliness.In', 'Mr.', 'Auster', 'Meg', 'comfort', 'mentor', 'needless', 'say', 'relationship', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'student', 'teaCher', 'interaction.Like', 'said', 'film', 'very', 'short', 'dealing', 'sadness', 'tough', 'subjects', 'Blue', 'Car', 'never', 'melodramatic', 'overwrought.It', 'had', 'tight', 'script', 'held', 'everything', 'together', 'well', 'great', 'acting', 'around.Agnes', 'Bruckner', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'lead', 'role.Subtle', 'quietly', 'intense', 'sullen', 'full', 'angst-she', 'nails', 'role', 'heart', 'ever', 'milking', 'sympathy.I', ""'m"", 'still', 'wondering', 'why', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'more', 'acclaim-she', 'very', 'talented', 'young', 'actress.David', 'Strathairn', 'was', 'perfect', 'role.Strathairn', 'smart', 'enough', 'actor', 'give', 'character', 'enough', 'dimension', 'complexity', 'are', ""n't"", 'able', 'completely', 'hate', 'moments', 'should.And', 'Margaret', 'Colin', 'Meg', 'mother', 'was', 'just', 'great', 'weary', 'mother.All', 'acting', 'felt', 'very', 'natural', 'understated', 'enough', 'provide', 'movie', 'earnestness', 'honest', 'quality', 'missing', 'many', 'films', 'denoument', 'was', 'little', 'harsh', 'totally', 'realistic.And', 'end', 'film', 'being', 'realistic', 'not', 'partcularly', 'quot', 'feel-good', 'quot', 'did', 'feel', 'quiet', 'hope', 'heroine.Blue', 'Car', ""n't"", 'going', 'change', 'life', 'very', 'fresh', 'little', 'film', 'great', 'acting', 'quiet', 'honesty', ""n't"", 'found', 'many', 'films', 'nowadays.Recommended']",N/A
767807,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B0000ARD7R,Alistair McHarg,"[4, 4]","Blue Car is no chuckle fest, this much is certain, but in its chilling realism, confident pacing, and expert acting is a sadness that has the exquisite beauty of truth, human truth.  This movie does not have characters, it has people.  Some you love, some you feel sorry for, some you despise; all are as actual as the last clerk who gave you change.Meg, Agnes Bruckner, would seem to have more than enough dysfunction in her life to satisfy the minimum daily angst requirement of a high school student.  Her divorced mother has both hands gripped firmly on the ledge and oscillates between neglect and rude intrusiveness.  Her father is virtually out of the picture.  Worse still, she is charged with the care of her mentally imbalanced younger sister, something between a chore and a trial.Smart and sensitive, Meg is disconnected, with little in life to rely on.  When her English teacher takes an interest in her poetry, and her, it introduces an unprecedented ray of hope into her life.  Like Agnes Bruckner, who gives a flawless performance that is bravely open and giving, David Strathairn's performance as her teacher, Mr. Auster, is practically a master's class in acting.Auster is no mere lech or predator; he is a weakling and emotional cripple who lives in a world where bad faith is revealed in layers.  Too cowardly to seduce Meg, he must create an environment where she drifts towards him naturally.  Because she is already so damaged, this process is painful to witness.People never stop finding ways to betray and disappoint Meg, and the more it happens, the more tightly she clutches her book of poems, her trip to Florida, and the tender support of Mr. Auster, the one person who believes in her.  But that is the nature of the blues.  You don't get the blues when you lose something you don't care about.  You get the blues when the only thing you have left, the one thing you knew you could trust and rely on, turns out to be a pathetic lie.  How you respond determines whether you get the blues, or they get you.Meg is a very brave young woman who knows more than she should have to know at such a tender age.

I think the real problem is the story. The plot, although probably very realistic, was obvious from the first time you saw the teacher. This story has been told so many times before it is practically urban legend for coming of age girls. I was frustrated that nothing new was brought to the story but rather just a very well made version of an old story.I feel bad for David Strathan he always plays these type of parts and the scene where he and his student hook up was downright creepy.  I felt like the story took a bit of a detour here in being true to its characters and became a tad ABC afternoon special.I was also annoyed that the writer chose to make the wife a drunk, I suppose so we would have some sympathy for the teacher but in the end the movie backtracks on that.

But I love how the female director avoided the obvious fireworks; the climax of the film is the girl's realization that her teacher (and now lover) really ISN'T writing a novel, like he led her to believe.That's the betrayal . . . and while there is a ""climax"" (no plot spoilers here).

767811,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B0000ARD7R,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[4, 4]","Sometimes what we fear most can become our only savior. Sometimes our only way out is into the arms of the ones that everyone else steers clear of. Sometimes too much compassion and too little self-control can lead a person to do the worst. Sometimes all we need is a chance, and a little bit of forgiveness, and sometimes running away will land us in more trouble than its worth. In Karen Moncrieff's BLUE CAR, we come to grips with this and many other ideas. But in the end we come to the conclusion that maybe some people need a break, and other just need to smile a little bit more.Meg (Agnes Bruckner, Murder By Numbers) is a bright and pretty girl who has a gift for writing poetry. Her teacher Mr. Auster (David Straithern, Simon Birch) sees promise in her poems and pushes Meg to dig deep into her soul, to pour out her feelings onto the page.You see Meg has a very complicated her life. Her father has divorced her mother, her mother is constantly abused by her boyfriend, her sister Lily won't eat and spends lot of time cutting herself, and Meg doesn't really have any direction. Poetry and her time with Mr. Auster is her way out. But when things start getting too tough, Mr. Auster's compassion turns into affection and the Meg's world begins to come crashing down.I find it funny that there are so many movies about this kind of teacher/student relationship are made. When I was in high school the thought of getting anywhere near my English teacher seems well just sick. But it works in BLUE CAR because the film begins to play with your head a little bit. It opens a door into the psyche of a man who wants so much to help and yet also loves to hurt.David Straithern plays his role with a lot of subtlety and charm. His actions in the film are reprehensible. His actions are evil. But he's just as broken. He's a child trapped in the body of an adult. He's been hardened by the life that screwed him. While he must pay for his crimes, you can see where his pain and awful power stem from.Agnes Bruckner plays her part with a certain kind of raw power. She's such a young talent, but also plays the part in a way that is very mature. Meg is a child trying to be an adult. It only at the moment of truth when we realize how vulnerable and young she really is. How easily manipulated she has become. Her struggle for survival is unnecessary and yet all she really needs is someone to reach out to her.BLUE CAR is the kind of movie you really want to praise and yet it's missing something. Maybe it should have been lighter; maybe it should have been less melodramatic. The story fails because it begins and ends in the same place. It's too sorrowful. The best character's can laugh even when times are bad. BLUE CAR seems to wallow in its sadness. Trying to tack on a hopeful ending.That being said BLUE CAR is not a bad film. It's got performances that are pitch perfect. I just wished the plot had overcome its dour tone. If you're looking for a fascinating character study, I give Blue Car a chance. If you're looking for some lighter fair, this is not the movie for you.**** (Out of 5)",4,A Passionate if Flawed Character Drama,1077926400,"02 28, 2004",2004,3102,"['Sometimes', 'what', 'fear', 'most', 'can', 'become', 'only', 'savior', 'Sometimes', 'only', 'way', 'out', 'arms', 'ones', 'everyone', 'else', 'steers', 'clear', 'Sometimes', 'too', 'much', 'compassion', 'too', 'little', 'self-control', 'can', 'lead', 'person', 'do', 'worst', 'Sometimes', 'need', 'chance', 'little', 'bit', 'forgiveness', 'sometimes', 'running', 'away', 'will', 'land', 'more', 'trouble', 'worth', 'Karen', 'Moncrieff', 'BLUE', 'CAR', 'come', 'grips', 'many', 'other', 'ideas', 'end', 'come', 'conclusion', 'maybe', 'people', 'need', 'break', 'other', 'just', 'need', 'smile', 'little', 'bit', 'more.Meg', 'Agnes', 'Bruckner', 'Murder', 'Numbers', 'bright', 'pretty', 'girl', 'who', 'gift', 'writing', 'poetry', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Auster', 'David', 'Straithern', 'Simon', 'Birch', 'promise', 'poems', 'pushes', 'Meg', 'dig', 'deep', 'soul', 'pour', 'out', 'feelings', 'page.You', 'see', 'Meg', 'very', 'complicated', 'life', 'father', 'divorced', 'mother', 'mother', 'constantly', 'abused', 'boyfriend', 'sister', 'Lily', 'wo', ""n't"", 'eat', 'lot', 'time', 'cutting', 'Meg', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'direction', 'Poetry', 'time', 'Mr.', 'Auster', 'way', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'getting', 'too', 'tough', 'Mr.', 'Auster', 'compassion', 'affection', 'Meg', 'world', 'come', 'crashing', 'down.I', 'find', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'kind', 'teacher/student', 'relationship', 'are', 'made', 'When', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'thought', 'getting', 'anywhere', 'English', 'teacher', 'well', 'just', 'sick', 'BLUE', 'CAR', 'film', 'play', 'head', 'little', 'bit', 'door', 'psyche', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'help', 'yet', 'also', 'hurt.David', 'Straithern', 'role', 'lot', 'subtlety', 'charm', 'actions', 'film', 'are', 'reprehensible', 'actions', 'are', 'evil', 'just', 'as', 'broken', 'child', 'trapped', 'body', 'adult', 'been', 'hardened', 'life', 'screwed', 'must', 'pay', 'crimes', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'pain', 'awful', 'power', 'stem', 'from.Agnes', 'Bruckner', 'part', 'certain', 'kind', 'raw', 'power', 'such', 'young', 'talent', 'also', 'part', 'way', 'very', 'mature', 'Meg', 'child', 'trying', 'be', 'adult', 'only', 'moment', 'truth', 'when', 'realize', 'how', 'vulnerable', 'young', 'really', 'How', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'become', 'struggle', 'survival', 'unnecessary', 'yet', 'really', 'someone', 'reach', 'out', 'her.BLUE', 'CAR', 'kind', 'movie', 'really', 'want', 'praise', 'yet', 'missing', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'lighter', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'melodramatic', 'story', 'same', 'place', 'too', 'sorrowful', 'best', 'character', 'can', 'laugh', 'even', 'when', 'times', 'are', 'bad', 'BLUE', 'CAR', 'wallow', 'sadness', 'Trying', 'tack', 'hopeful', 'ending.That', 'being', 'said', 'BLUE', 'CAR', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'got', 'performances', 'are', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'just', 'wished', 'plot', 'had', 'overcome', 'dour', 'tone', ""'re"", 'looking', 'fascinating', 'character', 'study', 'give', 'Blue', 'Car', 'chance', ""'re"", 'looking', 'lighter', 'fair', 'not', 'movie', '****', 'Out', '5']",N/A
767812,A2MZXLN9TLP1R4,B0000ARD7R,GLBT,"[4, 4]","I'm surprised that other reviewers found this movie boring or slow-moving. While it's true that there's relatively little &quot;action&quot; in Blue Car, the story moves along briskly and at no point did I feel like I was waiting for something to happen.The strength of this movie is in its authenticity. The main character, Meg, looks and behaves like a teenage girl overwhelmed by her circumstances, generally confused by everything around her, and constantly on the verge of flinching in fear of being hit by life's next big event. The crush that she develops on her teacher, the one person who seems to be making any effort at all to support her, evolves quite naturally. We can see what it is that she needs from him and how it gets mixed up (in her mind and in his) with his own needs and wants. As a teacher, I could totally identify with the way his role as teacher and his role as friend (and eventually romantic interest) became increasingly blurred. We'd all like to think that these things are totally separate and distinct, but the truth is that we're all far more complex than that. Different feelings get mixed together and it's not always possible to see what we're doing (and how it's effecting others) with total objectivity.The final outcome of the movie is painful but is handled beautifully. Things may not have worked out ideally, but Meg has grown from the experience and is now ready to start taking care of herself. This film respects all of its characters and no one is there to play the hero or the villain. Even Meg's negligent mother, who I wanted to throttle several times throughout the movie, is just a person overwhelmed by the circumstances that have gradually developed around her.This is the first movie I've seen in a while that just took my breath away.

Well, it was worth giving a try and definitely worth staying awake for.Blue Car is the type of film that plods along slowly but gradually sucks you in, very much on the same level as The Sweet Hereafter and The Weight of Water, until you're denying even the most intense bodily urges to go to the bathroom - all for the fear of missing something.In it, we quickly become fascinated with the lead actor in the film, one miss Agnes Bruckner, who plays Meg Dunning, the older of two sisters in what has become a dysfunctional Dunning family. The parents have been split for a while, and the mother is raisng her two blonde haired daughters while scraping by on end's meat. Meg is an introverted holdout from a time when words probably meant much, much more. She loves to write, particularly poetry, and is consumed with newfound esteem when her English teacher, the soft spoken and quietly married Mr. Auster (David Strathairn), begins to take an interest in her writing. At first, his intentions seem pure but deep down, the viewer senses that something is thickening between the two.Meanwhile, Meg is torn by thoughts of her negligent father, a man who leaves his daughter with the pensive memories of his blue car, and her younger sister who seems to be rapidly falling apart. Soon, courses of action are set in motion and the principle characters seem to act according to their own longings rather than adhering to the obvious warning signs that they seem to be fully aware of, but are unwilling to follow.This film was amazingly poignant, with acting that will make many weep.

When Meg's English literature teacher hears this piece he believes that she should compete for a poetic scholarship that is available.  He also offers to help her during his lunch hour.  In this process, she finds a strong foundation which she is lacking at home as her mother is constantly working or in school.

767816,AFOHUSVNZZ49W,B0000ARD7R,K. Reynolds,"[17, 17]","One of the great American myths is the one about choices, that there always is one. Another is that you can be anything you want to be with a bit of effort. Reality blasts the fairytales in &quot;Blue Car.&quot;This debut film from writer-director Karen Moncrieff is brilliant. Like the poetry of its lead character, the script is pared to its essentials. Even the score by Adam Gorgoni and Stuart Spencer-Nash is sparse, a melodic whisper with rock underpinnings. The family has been deserted by the father who drove off, we are told, in a blue car. Meg, played by Agnes Bruckner, walks the edge of adulthood long before she should. She cares for her troubled sister, Lily, and for her mother, Diane, an over-burdened woman trying to do the right thing without any help. Regan Arnold and Margaret Colin underplay the roles respectively.  Arnold's Lily is a haunting presence throughout; she sticks with you long after the film is over. Colin gives a great performance as a woman coping with one setback after the other. She looks to Meg for support as she makes plans for a new job, vents at her when things go wrong, and attempts to parent the girl when crisis develops. Yet as much as they may long for it, the mother-daughter relationship has dissolved long ago.Ultimately, this is Meg's story and we see the film unfold through her point of view. She copes by writing poetry. Her teacher, Mr. Auster, played by David Strathairn, challenges her to learn more about herself, to put more of herself in her work. Meg soon begins to look to Auster for emotional support. In winning his approval, she wins a place for herself -- but is it the place she wants to be? There are no easy answers.Coming of age films usually work better for male characters with films like &quot;Stand By Me.&quot; But female characters have improved with recent entries like &quot;Ghost World,&quot; &quot;My First Mister&quot; and, now, &quot;Blue Car.&quot; Moncrieff doesn't pull back from uncomfortable material, yet she doesn't sensationalize it. Meg's blue car may be an icon of despair, but it is also a symbol of hope. This storyteller knows how to drive.Video and audio are just fine. Extras include deleted scenes. They all work and add to the story, but it gives you an idea of how Moncrieff edited her work to its essentials.

I have now seen the film, and they are right: it is a powerful, moving film that deserves to be far better known than it is. My heart ached for Meg (Agnes Bruckner) and her mother (Margaret Colin), who end up at each other's throats largely because they have to deal with far more tragedy than anyone should ever have to face. And while I was glad at first for Meg to have Mr. Auster (David Strathairn) in her life, I also wondered where their relationship would end up, and suspected it could not possibly be anywhere good.While the film occasionally verges on the melodramatic, the clear direction and excellent writing of Karen Moncrieff keep it from going over the top, and the acting is extraordinary. Agnes Bruckner should have become a star from her performance as Meg; I suspect the problems Miramax was having at the time prevented this movie from reaching the audience it should have. But take a chance on it now; I suspect it will move you deeply. The disc includes more than a dozen deleted scenes, including one fairly important character who ended up on the cutting room floor.

This tells me two things: the reviewer in question didn't watch the film very carefully, and the distributor didn't know how to market it. With films of this quality, neither of these things is exactly a rare occurrence.""Blue Car"" is an extremely unique film, and nothing on the front or back covers of the DVD does much to prepare you for it. I was expecting a completely different movie, and so the story wound up sideswiping me, taking me by surprise and leaving me an emotional wreck when it was over. It's an honest, unflinching film, with a clarity of feeling lacking in many more clever movies.The film is the story of Meg, a suburban latchkey kid with a mother who's always working, a father who rarely makes the child support payments, and a younger sister who's a world all unto herself. Meg has aspirations to be a writer, to express herself and make her voice heard, and a teacher who might be willing to help her. If it sounds trite or predictable, then think again. My short description is where the movie starts out; where it goes from there will keep you watching irresistably the whole way through, and I guarantee you'll be surprised and moved by the end of it. Meg's story is that of many girls as they grow into their fondest wishes, full of the hope, the disappointment, and the rage that comes along for the ride.The movie is told in strikingly simple, unflashy visuals and natural dialogue. The acting is all top-notch, with believeable, honest (I keep using that word) performances from all concerned, including David Straithairn as Meg's teacher, an actor who I always enjoy seeing. His role in particular will keep you guessing all the way to the end. The music chosen and composed for the film serves it well, enhancing and augmenting the scenes without distracting from them. Two Lori Carson songs are especially effective in this regard.In a way, I can see why the reviewer compared ""Blue Car"" to ""American Beauty"" -- one element of both stories is superficially similar. But the core of the story of ""Blue Car"" is so completely different, and its overall effect so distant from that of ""American Beauty,"" that I find the comparison rather disappointing. Anybody reading that review will be expecting something very different than the movie ""Blue Car"" turned out to be. ""American Beauty"" was encouraging the viewer to ""look closer"" and to think about what they saw. In ""Blue Car,"" we are repeatedly entreated to ""go deeper"" and to face the feelings we find at the center of the film. ""Blue Car"" contains a raw emotional intensity and honesty that is extremely rare in modern film, and this alone makes the film a worthy journey to take.Challenge yourself a little.

It's a testament to Karen Moncrieff's film that, for the most part, that didn't diminish my enjoyment of it in the slightest.Meg Denning (The Woods beauty Agnes Bruckner) is a troubled high school student, pulling farther and farther away from her mother after her parents' divorce. She turns to her English teacher, Mr. Auster (David Strathairn), who encourages her to enter a nationwide poetry competition for high school students. When she wins the first round, she becomes obsessed with finding a way to get to the nationals in Florida without help from her mother (from whom she's keeping her victory) or her teacher (she doesn't want to impose).Moncrieff's script starts dropping hints that this won't be Dead Poets' Society pretty quickly once the mise-en-scene is set, and the main suspense in the film metamorphoses from ""will it happen?"" to ""when's it going to happen?"". Once we get to the Big Reveal(tm), the film does slip a bit, as the script goes down the most predictable possible pathway, and we end up with just another object lesson in Why It's Bad To Do The Things your Parents Warned You About. Still, it doesn't come off completely cheesy, and that's something. The pleasure of the ride was worth the suffering. And, you know, it's Agnes Bruckner.

This, actually is the daybreak of her life, for this betrayal shows anyone watching, what Meg had all along, what no one can take away from her, what stays inact no matter what.Despite having NO ONE, she manages to keep herself.  How?  It could be the poetry.  It could have been the false hope before all the betrayals, but, one thing is for certain, the kid's gonna need lotsa shrink work when she grows up.

767823,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,B0000ARD7R,Wanda B. Red,"[4, 4]","""Blue Car"" does a very impressive job of developing the growing closeness between Meg Denning (Agnes Bruckner) and her high school English teacher, Mr. Auster (David Strathairn). It is not easy to find a balance between sympathy and condemnation in dramatizing such a taboo and finally destructive relationship. The insightful script and, even more, the gifts of these two actors bring that off.The dismally joyless sex scene, fully prepared for by the writers and actors, was amazingly well done: Mr. Auster attempts to watch out for (or tries to convince himself that he is watching out for) Meg's needs, but his lust finally does him in. His desperate attempt to get her to declare that she ""wants him"" is simultaneously creepy and sad. Still, he tries to act the caring teacher even as he abandons her. Not surprisingly, she fails to give  him the benefit of the doubt. The audience hardly knows who to side with here. The result is ambiguous and very real; that scene keeps replaying in my memory.I thought the film was less successful in avoiding the trap of adolescent angst. Portraying the angst sometimes shaded into imitating it. On the overdramatic side, ""Blue Car"" loaded the character of Meg down with just too many tragedies, which I won't list here so as not to spoil the film (or further depress myself). In response to these, her character sometimes toppled over into self-indulgence, as expressed in her brooding poetry and her occasional histrionics. The symbol of the blue car, the car that her estranged father left in when he departed the family scene, is one example of a motif that could have been handled with greater restraint.I probably would have thought this was a really profound movie when I was seventeen -- in fact, I'm sure that I would have. So it's perhaps unfair of me now to expose it to the view from the other side of middle age. But in the end, despite its many virtues, I found it rather limited in its self-awareness.",3,Angst-ridden but redeemed by good acting,1147219200,"05 10, 2006",2006,1960,"['Blue', 'Car', 'very', 'impressive', 'job', 'developing', 'growing', 'closeness', 'Meg', 'Denning', 'Agnes', 'Bruckner', 'high', 'school', 'English', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Auster', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'not', 'easy', 'find', 'balance', 'sympathy', 'condemnation', 'dramatizing', 'taboo', 'finally', 'destructive', 'relationship', 'insightful', 'script', 'even', 'more', 'gifts', 'two', 'actors', 'bring', 'off.The', 'dismally', 'joyless', 'sex', 'scene', 'fully', 'prepared', 'writers', 'actors', 'was', 'amazingly', 'well', 'done', 'Mr.', 'Auster', 'watch', 'out', 'convince', 'watching', 'out', 'Meg', 'needs', 'lust', 'finally', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'get', 'declare', 'simultaneously', 'creepy', 'sad', 'Still', 'act', 'caring', 'teacher', 'even', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'audience', 'hardly', 'who', 'side', 'here', 'result', 'ambiguous', 'very', 'real', 'scene', 'keeps', 'replaying', 'memory.I', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'less', 'successful', 'avoiding', 'trap', 'adolescent', 'angst', 'Portraying', 'angst', 'sometimes', 'shaded', 'imitating', 'overdramatic', 'side', 'Blue', 'Car', 'loaded', 'character', 'Meg', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'tragedies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'list', 'here', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'film', 'further', 'depress', 'response', 'character', 'sometimes', 'toppled', 'over', 'self-indulgence', 'expressed', 'brooding', 'poetry', 'occasional', 'histrionics', 'symbol', 'blue', 'car', 'car', 'estranged', 'father', 'left', 'when', 'departed', 'family', 'scene', 'one', 'example', 'motif', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'greater', 'restraint.I', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'profound', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'seventeen', 'fact', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'perhaps', 'unfair', 'now', 'expose', 'view', 'other', 'side', 'middle', 'age', 'end', 'many', 'virtues', 'found', 'rather', 'limited', 'self-awareness']",N/A
767824,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B0000ARD7R,Westley,"[4, 4]","&quot;Blue Car&quot; is a small, independent film that may be easy for audiences to overlook, but it's definitely worthwhile.  Young actress Agnes Bruckner stars as teen-aged Meg.  She's like many girls her age - her parents are divorced, she has too much responsibility caring for her young sister, and she's ignored by her mother.  However, ""Blue Car"" isn't the clich&eacute;d story of an out-of-control, unruly teen.  Instead, Meg is a talented and sensitive writer and generally a good person.  However, her chaotic and lonely environment leads her down the wrong road.  Desperate for attention, she becomes involved in a strange relationship with her high school writing teacher (David Strathairn).The pace of ""Blue Car"" is somewhat measured and the tone is low-key, which may bore some viewers.  However, the plot was unpredictable enough to maintain my interest.  Also, the rather naturalistic acting is solid and adds a great deal to this small film.  First time director, Karen Moncrieff (best known for acting on several daytime soaps), also wrote the film, and she shows a great deal of talent.  I hope that she gets the opportunity to direct again.  Overall, ""Blue Car"" is an above-average and enjoyable indie film.",3,Above Average Coming of Age Story,1077321600,"02 21, 2004",2004,1227,"['quot', 'Blue', 'Car', 'quot', 'small', 'independent', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'easy', 'audiences', 'overlook', 'definitely', 'worthwhile', 'Young', 'actress', 'Agnes', 'Bruckner', 'teen-aged', 'Meg', 'many', 'girls', 'age', 'parents', 'are', 'divorced', 'too', 'much', 'responsibility', 'caring', 'young', 'sister', 'ignored', 'mother', 'However', 'Blue', 'Car', ""n't"", 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'story', 'out-of-control', 'unruly', 'teen', 'Instead', 'Meg', 'talented', 'sensitive', 'writer', 'generally', 'good', 'person', 'However', 'chaotic', 'lonely', 'environment', 'down', 'wrong', 'road', 'Desperate', 'attention', 'involved', 'strange', 'relationship', 'high', 'school', 'writing', 'teacher', 'David', 'Strathairn', '.The', 'pace', 'Blue', 'Car', 'somewhat', 'measured', 'tone', 'low-key', 'may', 'bore', 'viewers', 'However', 'plot', 'was', 'unpredictable', 'enough', 'maintain', 'interest', 'Also', 'rather', 'naturalistic', 'acting', 'solid', 'great', 'deal', 'small', 'film', 'First', 'time', 'director', 'Karen', 'Moncrieff', 'best', 'known', 'acting', 'several', 'daytime', 'soaps', 'also', 'wrote', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'talent', 'hope', 'opportunity', 'direct', 'again', 'Overall', 'Blue', 'Car', 'above-average', 'enjoyable', 'indie', 'film']",N/A
