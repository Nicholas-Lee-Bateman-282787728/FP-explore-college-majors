1150849,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0015U0QMQ,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[1, 1]","This is a very strange movie. It had moments of brillance and moments of stupidity. If it hadn't been for those brilliant moments, this would have been a 1 star movie.This is a story of three very separate lives that eventually come together at the end of the film. The director plays with the timeline in a pretty remarkable way, there's flash forward, flash back, and real time. The director was masterful with the movie's timeline. Everything makes some level of sense at the very end.Along the way, the trip is pretty darn rocky. There's a lot that would offend most. Oddly there's almost no nudity in this film. Just be aware, this is definately an NC-17 film, although it is unrated.Film-wise, there's some pretty interesting things going on.There's moments where the sound is so perfect, so spot on, you would swear that action is absolutely happening in your room. When somebody was banging on a door and a dog was barking, I actually got up to see if that was really happening. Then there are times where the dialog is almost unintelligable, like they ran out of money for the sound man during the  reshoots.Images, there are beautiful scenes, perfectly composed, shot, and lit. A special effect with a bullet that was kind of cool (a bit Matrix-ish, but good nonetheless). But then there are scenes where it looked like a high school film class with a video camera shot the scene - or could have done a better job.The ending is a bit strange. My first reaction was, oh no, it's the JFK bullet. Sadly, if a film about this particular topic has me thinking that at the end, it's probably not the best ending in the world.I can really only recommend this film to somebody with incredibly broad tastes, or somebody that really loves film for film sake. You have to check a huge amount of morality to get drawn in. Then again, don't we check our sense of right and wrong at the door when we watch a slasher film? This is not a slasher film, but it's the same concept.There is a far better film about this particular topic.

1150850,A1Q873Y5QSJY7U,B0015U0QMQ,Jo T.,"[1, 1]","I was surprised by this film.  I expected yet another B grade film for immature gore and titty hounds.  Instead, I found a film that refused to sensationalize the world of the sex industry and refused to cheapen itself with gratuitous scenes of sex and nudity.  Kudos to the film makers for attempting to make an ambitious movie about the lives of young men and women who find themselves caught in the sad, greedy, exploitative world of the sex industry.  The plot is complex enough to keep the viewer's attention.  This could have been a five star film -- if there had been better character development.  Although the sex workers and the sexually provocative high school women are portrayed sympathetically, they remain uni-dimensional and flat. Because we fail to get a richer sense of the characters, the movie lacks an emotional repertoire.  Melancholia is the only emotion it doled out.  Nonetheless, if you appreciate an honest look at the sex industry, this movie is worth watching.",4,for those who appreciate honesty,1374537600,"07 23, 2013",2013,989,"['was', 'surprised', 'film', 'expected', 'yet', 'B', 'grade', 'film', 'immature', 'gore', 'titty', 'hounds', 'Instead', 'found', 'film', 'refused', 'sensationalize', 'world', 'sex', 'industry', 'refused', 'cheapen', 'gratuitous', 'scenes', 'sex', 'nudity', 'Kudos', 'film', 'makers', 'attempting', 'make', 'ambitious', 'movie', 'lives', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'find', 'caught', 'sad', 'greedy', 'exploitative', 'world', 'sex', 'industry', 'plot', 'complex', 'enough', 'keep', 'viewer', 'attention', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'five', 'star', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'character', 'development', 'sex', 'workers', 'sexually', 'provocative', 'high', 'school', 'women', 'are', 'portrayed', 'sympathetically', 'remain', 'uni-dimensional', 'flat', 'fail', 'get', 'richer', 'sense', 'characters', 'movie', 'emotional', 'repertoire', 'Melancholia', 'only', 'emotion', 'doled', 'out', 'Nonetheless', 'appreciate', 'honest', 'look', 'sex', 'industry', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching']",On the Doll

On The Doll was filmed and edited masterfully.  This was the film's strongest point in my opinion.  Everything else was, ehhhh...  I was looking forward to seeing this for a week or so as I though it sounded interesting, and the fact that it had been totally rented out since it's release date.  Within five or ten minutes one can see the gorgeous camera work with an atmospheric soundscape that seemed to be well done, encompassing fairly shallow acting that seemed to be, not so well done.Lots of potential threading through this storyline which, cleverly enough, encompassed three different scenarios into one inevitable downward spiral.  Also, for those whom like me, rented this in hopes of some grotesque scenery will be terribly dissappointed.  I believe that the castration that happens within the last five minutes of the film is the only reason the MPAA refused to grant an R rating.  That's all you get here gorehounds, and though the effects were realistic enough, the inclusion of this seemed rather arbitrary, since it was supposedly an accident.  If you want my opinion, stear clear of this and try ""Descent"" with Rosario Dawson.  It is a lot slower paced, but more professionally executed and thus creating more effect.  I tried this one out hoping for lots of sex, drugs, and gore, and was suprised when I became bored with the film's direction, and irritated with the subpar acting.
