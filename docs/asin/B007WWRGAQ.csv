The box that it comes in is very sturdy cardboard and does indeed look nice. Once you open it, there are four book like holders on each side of the box. On most pages, there is a disc on top and one in front on the bottom. Almost every booklet I went through, the bottom flap was not connected and the disc itself was stuck to the tiny drop of glue that apparently was supposed to keep this all together. Great series.

The set itself is truly adorable, with the box designed to look like a wooden chest, featuring gold detailing around the corners and a 'keyhole' to unlock the secrets of Wisteria Lane. The top of the box is embossed with the Adam and Eve design from the opening credits. Inside, the DVDs are housed in various books representing each of the seasons, four on each side. To me, they resemble photo albums and they sport quotes from the shows as well as stills from certain episodes. The bonus disc is housed in a separate sleeve designed to look like an apple. Indeed, apples are featured throughout the box set, one being showcased on the underside of the lid in rich, gleaming crimson and the season books each feature an apple in the stages of being eaten, until only the core remains on the back of the final season. All in all, I could not be happier with Buena Vista and their treatment of this iconic show! The set is rich in detail and most certainly appears like a collector's piece.

1539410,A12VND3BWSF3PL,B007WWRGAQ,Humphrey Dao,"[5, 8]","I was a fan of ""Desperate Housewives"" from the moment it premiered on October 3, 2004 and every Sunday night for eight seasons, I never missed a single episode. It struck a chord for me in a way no series had before or since. It satisfied me on an emotional level and it engaged me (and a lot of the time frustrated me) on an intellectual level. While I would argue that this show as a whole is undoubtedly flawed; while I could argue that it will never be viewed as a great show in the same way ""The Sopranos,"" ""Mad Men,"" or ""Breaking Bad"" will ten, twenty years from now; ""Desperate Housewives"" I believe will be viewed as a game changer in the primetime soap opera genre. Viewed intellectually, ""Housewives"" is a curious product of the tail-end of the Bush era, premiering nineteen months after the United States first invaded Iraq, the second season airing a month after Hurricane Katrina, and the global financial crisis and housing bubble collapse of 2007-2008 greatly influencing the storylines of the later seasons. This was a show that was unlike anything that was on broadcast television at the time, and became a cultural juggernaut because of it. ""Desperate Housewives"" was the right show at the right time, staking its claim on the television landscape and making the case seen earlier in ""Sex and the City"" (and earlier than that in ""The Golden Girls"") that a series could be carried by four women--three of whom were in their forties. The show itself was an odd creature. It was a jumble of genres and tones, unwilling to settle for a consistent tone and being all the better for it. It could be very dark and suspenseful at times, and it could be very light, comedic, slapstick, and sometimes satiric. ""Desperate Housewives"" reflected a view of suburban life that was pure Pop and of the early 2000s. It was as if someone were to take the earlier suburban primetime soaps like ""Peyton Place"" and ""Knots Landing"" and ratcheted up the irony while also adding more sitcom gags.I believe what initially drew the critics to champion the series (and subsequently to drop it during its infamous sophomore slump) was that they assumed (incorrectly) the series was making an artistic statement about the unseemly underbelly of the middle class, hidden behind a sterling suburban facade. This was a show, after all, that in its first season saw pretty much all of its leading ladies committing some illegal act amid all the murder, hit-and-run accidents, suicide, blackmail, and adultery which regularly occurred on a seemingly peaceful street called Wisteria Lane in an ironically-named town of Fairview. What was ultimately the undoing of the show, at least critically, was that ""Desperate Housewives"" revealed itself to be a series with less lofty goals--or perhaps the series just became no longer novel to critics and audiences. Admittedly, the storylines began to repeat themselves but with different characters substituted in, and the soap opera began to overpower the satirical elements that kept the series focused. More importantly, ""Desperate Housewives"" began to get earnest. Storylines weren't played cynically as much (like in earlier seasons when Lynette pretended her son had cancer to get into yoga class or when the neighborhood pedophile dressed up as Santa for the block party). There is no denying that tonally, ""Desperate Housewives"" became a slightly different show from season 5 onward, both in terms of the 5-year time jump that radically changed the dynamic of the show, and the level of sincerity that the writers were going for then. It's a little jarring to watch the first season and the eighth season and notice the contrast in how much more grounded in tone the final season is. The storylines, while still soapy, were no longer capital-C Crazy, like the time Carlos and Gaby stole a baby, or when Susan ran over a roller-skating Edie with her car. The later seasons were more truthful and got to the heart of the human experience, dealing with issues such as parenting, marriage, love, life, and death. In some ways, I actually prefer seasons 6 through 8 to the first few. For one, although ""Desperate Housewives"" was one of those few examples of shows that instantly hit the ground running, characters like Gabrielle and Carlos didn't truly find their voice until sometime in season 2. The storytelling of the first couple of seasons also went through some awkward growing pains. Entire storylines were either introduced and then dropped (like Susan's biological father in season 2) or seemingly came out of nowhere (Susan's ""wandering spleen"" in season 2, Orson's kleptomania in season 5).Revisiting this series again close to a year after it ended and re-watching various episodes throughout all eight of its seasons, I'm struck by how funny most of the episodes are upon a second viewing. Episodes that I thought were boring when I watched them a long time ago I'm re-watching now and noticing a lot more of the offhand jokes that the writers threw in that I didn't notice before because I was watching more for the plot. It is also evident viewing this series as a whole that some season storylines were much stronger than others. There is, of course, the first season mystery involving Mary Alice which is simply iconic to the fabric of the series and indisputably excellent. However, I'm also personally very fond of season 6 which introduced the dual mysteries of Drea de Matteo as a housewife on the run for a murder she inadvertently caused (and which was essentially a ripoff of the movie ""Running on Empty"") and of the Fairview strangler (an excellent character whose existence brought about my all-time favorite episode called ""Epiphany""). Season 8 and season 4 are exceptionally strong, cohesive seasons with the least amount of filler episode storylines and the strongest pacing. Season 3 was a solid and well-plotted season for the first 15 episodes, but then loses direction and has what is perhaps the weakest season finale of the entire series. Season 2 and Season 5 were weakened by a bloated cast and storylines that didn't click. Season 5 had the weakest mystery and the most filler stand-alone episodes that did not move the narrative forward. Season 7 essentially repeats the season 5 mystery, but the main character and season mystery were more thought-out, incorporated the cast better, and reached a much more satisfying story arc.The packaging for ""The Complete Collection Deluxe Edition"" gave me some concerns at first from reading some of the reviews, but at least for my copy, it wasn't too bad. The box is a definite selling point. It is made of very thick, sturdy cardboard made to look like a wooden chest. There are several nice flourishes such as etched embellished designs on the top and bottom of the box, as well as shiny gold foil accents on the corners and raised gold dots that line the border of the top lid. ""Desperate Housewives: the Complete Collection"" is wisely placed on the front panel of the box so that the top of the box shows only the famous Monty Python-esque animated image of Adam and Eve that appeared at the beginning of the full opening credits sequence. Inside, you will find a short note written and signed by Marc Cherry printed on very nice cardstock paper with the type in gold lettering. A bonus disc is included in a disc folder shaped as an apple which has a decent selection of featurettes including a documentary on the filming of the final episode and a clip montage/interview retrospective on the many deaths on Wisteria Lane that I quite enjoyed. The DVD cases are glossy cardboard fold-out disc holders that open up like a digipak case. Most discs are stored with one disc at the bottom overlapping one disc at the top, slipped into a half circle cut out. There was some issue for my copy with some of the sticky residue that held the disc panels together getting on the edge of several discs, but they can be removed by rubbing some hot water with your index finger gently and slowly on the sticky area (which at least for my copy, was a small amount--barely 1 mm big). I was fortunate with the amount of scratches. There were a couple of discs that had very light scratch marks that ran parallel down the disc, sort of resembling a spider web, but they all played without a problem. Don't be discouraged if you find some of your discs have some scratches because 8 times out of 10 they still play without any problems and the issue is largely cosmetic. DVDs are more often than not more resilient than people think. The DVD cases all have a picture of the main four housewives on the front (no fifth housewife Edie, Katherine, or Renee included, likely for consistency's sake) and the overall design I think was meant to resemble a photo album.",5,Series is a Joy to Rewatch and Re-Evaluate; Packaging is Not Too Bad,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",2013,8759,"['was', 'fan', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'moment',

I am SO glad I did.The box is not wood, as many people on message boards have been asking. However, it is a very sturdy, thick, pressed cardboard (one of the sturdiest box sets I've seen) covered with a beautiful glossy finish. Inside you will find the individual season sets in the dreaded thin slip cases. I know many people complain about these, but really, I have never had any discs that came in this type of holder to be permanently damaged. I have had some surface scuffs in the past, but nothing that ever affected the playback. The individual seasons are the same as the previous releases, with all the same features, just in these slip cases. The artwork on these slip cases are not of the previous releases...these match each other...but the artwork on the discs all appear to be from the previous releases. I would also like to note that I have had no issues as far as glue being on the discs, discs being dislodged, or any of the issues that I have noticed in other reviews. Perhaps I lucked up with a good, clean set...?The bonus disc comes in a cute little apple shaped sleeve, and has the following features:The End of the Lane: Last Days on SetCurtain Call: The Desperate Housewives FamilyCherry Cam(eo)Desperately DeadMore From the Series (which consists of some new bonus features from Seasons 3 & 5)Finally, there is a note from Marc Cherry, printed on a thick paper stock (about 5x7 inches) that looks much like a wedding invitation, with embossed designs, where he is basically telling the origins of the show idea and thanks the fans.I love this set, and I am planning to revisit the women, men and all the rest of the residents of Wisteria Lane from beginning to end.
