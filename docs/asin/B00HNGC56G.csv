This show is hysterical, and Bob Newhart and company never fail to deliver the laughs. I also love his dry sense of humor, and this season had me laughing the entire time. It makes me long for the days when this kind of programming was the norm.  Loved it, and looking forward to the release of the next Season. I also cannot wait for Season 5, as the episode Goodbye and Good Riddance Mr. Chips, was hilarious, as Dick decides to take a typing class, and his teacher is none other than the same man who taught him Geography in elementary school, and he still treats him and the class as if they were all ten years old.",5,Only When I Laugh!,1398556800,"04 27, 2014",2014,737,"['always', 'loved', 'show', 'never', 'realized', 'how', 'funny', 'truly', 'as', 'compared', 'what', 'described', 'commedy', 'today', 'show', 'hysterical', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'company', 'never', 'fail', 'deliver', 'laughs', 'also', 'love', 'dry', 'sense', 'humor', 'season', 'had', 'laughing', 'entire', 'time', 'long', 'days', 'when', 'kind', 'programming', 'was', 'norm', 'Loved', 'looking', 'forward', 'release', 'next', 'Season', 'also', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'Season', '5', 'episode', 'Goodbye', 'Good', 'Riddance', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'was', 'hilarious', 'Dick', 'take', 'typing', 'class', 'teacher', 'none', 'other', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'taught', 'Geography', 'elementary', 'school', 'still', 'class', 'were', 'ten', 'years', 'old']",Newhart: The Complete Third Season

In this the 3rd season we get to know some of these characters better and better which will eventually lead to the hilarious 4th and maybe best season.  However, there never was a bad episode of Newhart and we get some classics here like ""My Fair Larry"", ""the Prodigal Daryll"", ""A Hunting we will go"" and ""Happy Trails to you"", which was also the title of the last episode of the Bob Newhart Show. I found that interesting.  In this season we start getting to know some of the eccentric side characters better like Jim and Chester and Harley. We even meet Stephanies father played wonderfully by Jose Ferrer. This only deepens the richness of the shows atmosphere. One thing I have always appreciated about this show is that the setting is Vermont, and you truly get the feeling that it was filmed there even though I think it was filmed on a soundstage in Hollywood. Hopefully the Shout Factory has got the bugs worked out of this and gives us a flawless print this time.

Much like other TV shows, the low life's that released the first DVD released only that one season. I was so pleasantly pleased to discover that Shout Factory would be releasing the rest of the seven remaining seasons. Season three continues with the charm and wit of all of the principle actors and actresses from season two, with Julia Duffy and Larry, Darryl and Darryl contributing more and more laughs. This was such a great comedy with good clean humor and wit that is sadly missing in the &#34;reality&#34; crap shows that dominate today's TV. Kudos to Shout for making this beloved series available. Known for their quality and thoroughness, I completely expect all seasons to become available in short order.
