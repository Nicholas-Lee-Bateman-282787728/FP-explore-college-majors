809724,A2X016MRJ0XVT6,B0001LJCKC,David J. Heinrich,"[4, 7]","This movie was a worthy sequel to the original installment. They were clever, and didn't use different actors for the same charactesr, which almost always is a disaster (the exception, imo, would be Scarlet, the sequel to Gone With The Wind). Instead, they focused on Katherine's cousein, Cassidy, who's very worthy of being a successor, and her malevolent friend, Jason. The movie is charming, and has its own, different, plot. The ending is particularly good, because of the double-twist. The really interesting thing is that you're actually rooting for Cassidy and Jason to get together, and they do in a way.The background music in this movie is normally good, and fits with the mood. However, it doesn't have something as awesome as Verge's Bitter Sweet Symphony.If you liked this movie, I'd recommend reading Choderos de Laclos' book: it's a classic. I'd also recommend Marquis de Sade's _Juliette_.",4,a worthy sequel,1110585600,"03 12, 2005",2005,905,"['movie', 'was', 'worthy', 'sequel', 'original', 'installment', 'were', 'clever', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'different', 'actors', 'same', 'charactesr', 'almost', 'always', 'disaster', 'exception', 'imo', 'would', 'be', 'Scarlet', 'sequel', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Instead', 'focused', 'Katherine', 'cousein', 'Cassidy', 'who', 'very', 'worthy', 'being', 'successor', 'malevolent', 'friend', 'Jason', 'movie', 'charming', 'own', 'different', 'plot', 'ending', 'particularly', 'good', 'double-twist', 'really', 'interesting', 'thing', ""'re"", 'actually', 'rooting', 'Cassidy', 'Jason', 'get', 'together', 'do', 'way.The', 'background', 'music', 'movie', 'normally', 'good', 'mood', 'However', ""n't"", 'have', 'something', 'as', 'awesome', 'Verge', 'Bitter', 'Sweet', 'Symphony.If', 'liked', 'movie', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'reading', 'Choderos', 'Laclos', 'book', 'classic', ""'d"", 'also', 'recommend', 'Marquis', 'Sade', '_Juliette_']",N/A

This movie is even better than cruel intentions 2 for those of you who have seen it.

The second...well, it was a pretty decent prequel, thought production value was like a grade-B movie.This third has a better presentation than the second, but the storyline sucks so bad!!!

809728,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B0001LJCKC,Joshua Koppel,"[21, 23]","First there was Les Liaisons Dangereuses by Choderlos De Laclos.  Then there was Dangerous Liaisons in 1988.  This was followed by Valmont in 1989.  We then had Cruel Intentions in 1999 which moved the story to high school age.  This was followed by a retelling in Cruel Intentions 2 that should just be ignored.  Then there was the mega epic Les Liaisons Dangereuses in 2003 (more than 3 hours).  Finally we have Cruel Intentions 3 (2004) that acts as a direct sequel to Cruel Intentions by adding a cousin and then sets the tale at a very bizarre college.Cassidy is a cousin of the characters from the first movie.  She and tease-object Jason like to play games.  The games start quick and fast as it almost seems like everyone is out to do in someone else.  There is no virginal target in this one.  That has been replaced with a faithful target (but definitely not a virgin).  Oddly, she is the target of a third character named Patrick.  Eventually the games of Cassidy, Jason, and Patrick do become dangerous (as well as cruel).Unlike the first movie, however, while Cassidy is quite a snob, there is none of the evil cultured grace of the first film.  These characters could have been anybody from any background.  While the added Patrick dimension added a little originality it failed to make up for the loss of the evil cultured grace.

There was a strong chemistry within the cast (obviously since Reese & Ryan married!) and the characters weren't one dimensional. Even evil Kathryn was capable of pain that Sarah Michelle Gellar managed to convey in brief moments which was perfect for that character. But Cassidy for CI3 falls way short of being three dimensional. She's just cruel for the whole film and showed no weakness. Everyone has a weakness. However, I will say that the character Patrick somewhat intrigued me. He went beyond the game of cruelty and ...well, I won't give away what happens, but I was very disturbed by it.
