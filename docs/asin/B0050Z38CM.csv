I know that I will spend hours watching and enjoying the whole movie again and again.  It's a shame that the shows of today cannot begin to compete with the older movies.  It seems like today the writers only know one subject and that is sex,---- too bad.  Some of us like other subjects, too, and the older movies provide that education.",5,"""Margie"", the girl who didn't know she had everything.",1399075200,"05 3, 2014",2014,482,"['am', 'so', 'happy', 'finally', 'get', 'DVD', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'remember', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'girl', 'high', 'school', 'know', 'will', 'spend', 'hours', 'watching', 'enjoying', 'whole', 'movie', 'again', 'again', 'shame', 'shows', 'today', 'can', 'not', 'begin', 'compete', 'older', 'movies', 'today', 'writers', 'only', 'know', 'one', 'subject', 'sex', 'too', 'bad', 'other', 'subjects', 'too', 'older', 'movies', 'provide', 'education']",Margie (1946)

This is one of Jeanne Crain's best films, and uses her natural charm and retiscence to great advantage.Margie is a 20's high school girl. She isn't popular, and has a goofy family life, but through a series of adorable mishaps, largely involving a pair of stretched out bloomers, she manages to catch the eye of the hunky new French teacher. (This is the olden days before high school girls were off limits for handsome young teachers).Crain is ably supported by 20th Century Fox's  top contract players such as Esther Dale as Grandma McSweeney, Hobart Cavannaugh as Margie's undertaker father, leggy Barbara Lawrence as Margie's romantic rival, and Conrad Janis as the dreamiest racoon coat wearing sheik. It is guaranteed you will come away humming a few of the catchiest tunes from the early part of the last century. Based on Ruth McKenney's (My Sister Eileen )story with a surprise ending, Margie is a terrific family film you'll want to watch again and again.",4,"""Take the marines Out of Nicaragua!""",1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,1128,"['roaring', ""'20"", 'when', 'youth', 'was', 'flaming', 'girls', 'were', 'flappers', 'boys', 'were', 'shieks', 'Charleston', 'was', 'national', 'anthem', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'Margie', 'one', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'best', 'films', 'natural', 'charm', 'retiscence', 'great', 'advantage.Margie', '20', 'high', 'school', 'girl', ""n't"", 'popular', 'goofy', 'family', 'life', 'series', 'adorable', 'mishaps', 'largely', 'involving', 'pair', 'stretched', 'bloomers', 'catch', 'eye', 'hunky', 'new', 'French', 'teacher', 'olden', 'days', 'before', 'high', 'school', 'girls', 'were', 'off', 'limits', 'handsome', 'young', 'teachers', '.Crain', 'ably', 'supported', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'top', 'contract', 'players', 'such', 'Esther', 'Dale', 'Grandma', 'McSweeney', 'Hobart', 'Cavannaugh', 'Margie', 'undertaker', 'father', 'leggy', 'Barbara', 'Lawrence', 'Margie', 'romantic', 'rival', 'Conrad', 'Janis', 'dreamiest', 'racoon', 'coat', 'wearing', 'sheik', 'guaranteed', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'humming', 'few', 'catchiest', 'tunes', 'early', 'part', 'last', 'century', 'Based', 'Ruth', 'McKenney', 'Sister', 'Eileen', 'story', 'surprise', 'ending', 'Margie', 'terrific', 'family', 'film', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'again']",Margie (1946)
1436194,A6S7155T8VTHK,B0050Z38CM,J. F. McCausland,"[9, 9]","Margie has always been one of my favorite films from the first time I saw it on late night television as a young girl. In 1946, Margie is reminiscing with her teenage daughter about how she met and fell in love with her father in 1928 while still in high school. Margie had a secret crush on Johnny, the popular boyfriend of her flirtatious neighbor, Marybelle, while nerdy Roy had a not so secret crush on Margie. Then there was the handsome French teacher, Professor Fontayne, whom every girl in school was openly crushing on. Problem was that every time she encountered one of her crushes, she ended up doing something stupid and badly embarrassing herself, particularly because of a pair of old-fashioned bloomers that refused to remain hidden. All the while, steady best friend Roy is ever at her side. It is never clear, until the very end, when the husband joins his wife and daughter in the attic, just who Margie married, and that is half the fun. The music is also beautiful, although this isn't a typical musical, as the songs are integrated pretty well into the story, without a lot of breaking into song at odd moments. It consists mostly of popular music from the flapper era, with standouts being ""I'll See You In My Dreams"", ""April Showers"", ""My Time Is Your Time"", and ""Coffee, A Sandwich, And You"". The entire cast is utterly perfect, perfect say I! Jeanne Crain manages to capture the coltish awkwardness of a shy, brainy teenager who hasn't quite grown into her body yet. The three men in Margie's life, played by Glenn Langan - the French professor, Alan Young - dependable Roy, and Conrad Janis - ""Johnnykins"",  are all a lot of fun, but a special kudo must go to Alan Young, who has the most difficult role as the nerdy best friend. Esther Dale as the bumptious Grandma McSweeney and Hobart Cavanaugh as the loving but absentee father, Angus MacDuff, have some of the best lines in the film, and it surely seems as if they had a great time, especially in their scenes together. Surprisingly, this was filmed on location in Reno, Nevada, but it looks very similar to the small towns in Ohio where I grew up, and where the story is set. Margie is a wonderful piece of fluff that is exceedingly entertaining from start to finish. Enjoy! It's special!",5,Must See Movie!
