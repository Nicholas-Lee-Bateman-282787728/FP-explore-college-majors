However, if you are fans of the show you'll probably find some funny moments here. The plot manages to combine elements of ""Terminator"", ""Frankenstein"", ""Indiana Jones"" and ""Desperate Housewives"" along with several other nods to various movies. On paper you don't see how any of these movies have anything to do with each other, but in the world of ""Rift"" these all blend together very neatly.The problem with movie is unlike the TV show it is allowed to swear, as such they seemed to go out of their way to make sure every character gets to drop the f bomb. It gets old after awhile. As a side note ""Six"" is now voiced by Jenny McCarthy (previously by Gina Gershon and Carmen Electra), McCarthy does come off quite as sexy as the other two did.The TV show is better, but there are some funny moments to be found here by fans.",3,Not as good as TV show,1206489600,"03 26, 2008",2008,988,"['First', 'movie', 'fans', 'TV', 'show', ""'re"", 'coming', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'show', ""'ll"", 'be', 'lost', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'here', 'enjoy', 'However', 'are', 'fans', 'show', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'funny', 'moments', 'here', 'plot', 'combine', 'elements', 'Terminator', 'Frankenstein', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'several', 'other', 'nods', 'various', 'movies', 'paper', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'movies', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'other', 'world', 'Rift', 'blend', 'together', 'very', 'neatly.The', 'problem', 'movie', 'TV', 'show', 'allowed', 'swear', 'such', 'seemed', 'go', 'way', 'make', 'sure', 'character', 'drop', 'f', 'bomb', 'old', 'awhile', 'side', 'note', 'Six', 'now', 'voiced', 'Jenny', 'McCarthy', 'previously', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'Carmen', 'Electra', 'McCarthy', 'come', 'off', 'quite', 'as', 'sexy', 'other', 'two', 'did.The', 'TV', 'show', 'better', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'fans']","Tripping The Rift, Movie"

Be warned though, this is NOT for kids or even older adults with little tolerance for this kind of anarchic humor.Not to be confused (or even compared for that matter) with the like minded South Park, or even earlier Beavis & Butthead, Tripping goes one step further into some pretty filthy humor.The characters are funny, but as a viewer it's a plus to be familiar with Star Trek, Star Wars, Deep Space Nine and most other contemporary Sci Fi movies and shows to appreciate the gags.It's much easier to parody using animation, it doesn't require the scripting, or acting and set locations of say a Zucker brothers movie, or even the more recent Scary Movie style parodies. But don't be put off by that on it's own, as there are some genuine funny moments.Like the TV series the graphics, and sound are excellent, as is the voice acting by people like Stephen Root (Office Space), but this will probably dwell in the cult basement and appeal most to the 18-25 demographic, along with other adult themed animation.Good but not great, I was underwhelmed most of the time, I'm sorry to say.3 Stars for visuals.",3,So so parody heavy on profanity means a small audience,1205971200,"03 20, 2008",2008,1286,"['like', 'computer', 'generated', 'animation', 'kick', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'adult', 'themes', 'LOT', 'profanity', 'innuendo', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'provide', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'Be', 'warned', 'NOT', 'kids', 'even', 'older', 'adults', 'little', 'tolerance', 'kind', 'anarchic', 'humor.Not', 'be', 'confused', 'even', 'compared', 'matter', 'like', 'minded', 'South', 'Park', 'even', 'earlier', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'Tripping', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'pretty', 'filthy', 'humor.The', 'characters', 'are', 'funny', 'viewer', 'plus', 'be', 'familiar', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'most', 'other', 'contemporary', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'movies', 'appreciate', 'gags.It', 'much', 'easier', 'parody', 'using', 'animation', ""n't"", 'require', 'scripting', 'acting', 'set', 'locations', 'say', 'Zucker', 'brothers', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'recent', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'style', 'parodies', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'own', 'are', 'genuine', 'funny', 'TV', 'series', 'graphics', 'sound', 'are', 'excellent', 'voice', 'acting', 'people', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'Office', 'Space', 'will', 'probably', 'dwell', 'cult', 'basement', 'appeal', 'most', '18-25', 'demographic', 'other', 'adult', 'themed', 'animation.Good', 'not', 'great', 'was', 'underwhelmed', 'most', 'time', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say.3', 'Stars', 'visuals']","Tripping The Rift, Movie"

1137409,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,B0012IX34Y,Andrew McCaffrey,"[2, 3]","The back cover of the DVD case screams, ""Foul Language!  Senseless Violence!  Gratuitous Nudity!  It's A Real #@!*&% Movie!""  While that last claim may be stretching the boundaries of the definition of ""movie"", I vastly agree that those promises have been fulfilled.But there is a problem.Despite all the rudeness, despite all the over-the-top excesses, despite all the foul language and salty dialog, the movie is not actually funny.Now, before criticizing the film's drawbacks, it should be noted that this almost can't be considered a movie at all.  According to information I spent sheer minutes researching on the Internet, this is not a feature-length movie based on the television series of the same name.  Rather this is three or four random episodes of said television series edited together into a seventy-five minute whole.  The story-line jerks wildly from place to place with no thought given to structure or pacing.  Audiences won't have been this confused since Robert Denby randomly appeared halfway through RIDING WITH DEATH with only a crudely attempted ADR to explain his presence.Out of a sense of obligation rather than for any real desire on my part, I will attempt to give a brief summary.  A band of intergalactic misfits travel around the galaxy and have adventures; think ""Futurama"" but with more sleaze and less laughter. In this film, they get hired as bodyguards for a princess, plan a birthday part for Chode (the short, purple, tentacled thing), escape from a robotic assassin of the future, and hang out in an episode of Desperate Housewives.There are a lot of movie and television parodies, but the film doesn't do anything interesting with the source material.  The producers mostly just repeat scenes from other films without actually making them funny (or even different).  And that's emblematic of this film's main flaw.  It goes to a lot of trouble to set up a platform on which to tell jokes, and then it completely forgets to tell jokes.I could almost forgive this film had it tried its hand at comedy but failed.  The problem is that it barely even tries.  It seems to believe that naughty language by itself will make anyone laugh.  It confuses simple duplication of well-known cinematic set pieces with parody.  And it simply gives up when attempting new material.  These days, there are a lot of choices when looking for science-fiction comedies; try one of those other options instead.",1,"""You know, four movies went into the making of this film..."" -- MST3k",1208304000,"04 16, 2008",2008,2430,"['back', 'cover', 'DVD', 'case', 'screams', 'Foul', 'Language', 'Senseless', 'Violence', 'Gratuitous', 'Nudity', 'Real', '@', '*', '%', 'Movie', 'last', 'claim', 'may', 'be', 'stretching', 'boundaries', 'definition', 'movie', 'vastly', 'agree', 'promises', 'have', 'been', 'fulfilled.But', 'problem.Despite', 'rudeness', 'over-the-top', 'excesses', 'foul', 'language', 'salty', 'dialog', 'movie', 'not', 'actually', 'funny.Now', 'criticizing', 'film', 'drawbacks', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'almost', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'considered', 'movie', 'According', 'information', 'spent', 'sheer', 'minutes', 'researching', 'Internet', 'not', 'feature-length', 'movie', 'based', 'television', 'series', 'same', 'name', 'three', 'four', 'random', 'episodes', 'said', 'television', 'series', 'edited', 'together', 'seventy-five', 'minute', 'whole', 'story-line', 'jerks', 'wildly', 'place', 'place', 'thought', 'given', 'structure', 'pacing', 'Audiences', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'confused', 'Robert', 'Denby', 'randomly', 'appeared', 'halfway', 'RIDING', 'WITH', 'DEATH', 'only', 'crudely', 'attempted', 'ADR', 'explain', 'presence.Out', 'sense', 'obligation', 'rather', 'real', 'desire', 'part', 'will', 'attempt', 'give', 'brief', 'summary', 'band', 'intergalactic', 'misfits', 'travel', 'galaxy', 'have', 'adventures', 'think', 'Futurama', 'more', 'sleaze', 'less', 'laughter', 'film', 'get', 'hired', 'bodyguards', 'princess', 'plan', 'birthday', 'part', 'Chode', 'short', 'purple', 'tentacled', 'thing', 'escape', 'robotic', 'assassin', 'future', 'hang', 'out', 'episode', 'Desperate', 'Housewives.There', 'are', 'lot', 'movie', 'television', 'parodies', 'film', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'interesting', 'source', 'material', 'producers', 'mostly', 'just', 'repeat', 'scenes', 'other', 'films', 'actually', 'making', 'funny', 'even', 'different', 'emblematic', 'film', 'main', 'flaw', 'lot', 'trouble', 'set', 'up', 'platform', 'tell', 'jokes', 'then', 'completely', 'tell', 'jokes.I', 'could', 'almost', 'forgive', 'film', 'had', 'tried', 'hand', 'comedy', 'failed', 'problem', 'barely', 'even', 'believe', 'naughty', 'language', 'will', 'make', 'anyone', 'laugh', 'simple', 'duplication', 'well-known', 'cinematic', 'set', 'pieces', 'parody', 'simply', 'up', 'when', 'attempting', 'new', 'material', 'days', 'are', 'lot', 'choices', 'when', 'looking', 'science-fiction', 'comedies', 'try', 'one', 'other', 'options', 'instead']","Tripping The Rift, Movie"

1137413,AD2DDHLD6FRFM,B0012IX34Y,Brad Baker,"[1, 4]","Cinegroup has just released ""Tripping the Rift: The Movie"", an unrated, animated,  greatest hits package of the third TV season, with a bit of cussing to make it edgy.  ""Tripping the Rift"" started out as a five-minute internet short. Set in the distant future, it's about ship Jupiter 42, which is led by Captain Chode McBlob, a spaceman that only thinks about eating, porn, and a quick buck.  The pilot of the ship is T'Nuk, a frankly rather ugly cow. Whip is a lizard-like creature who is as smart as a brick, and there's the engineer, a robot named Gus; he's the butt of all the gay jokes.  Our last player is Six, a tall, sexy android.  So here we have our motley crew of antiheroes flying around the galaxy, just trying to stay one step ahead of the authorities. This is no ""Shrek"".  This smudgy, X-Rated computer animation features broad parodies of ""The Terminator"", ""Star Wars"", ""Desperate Housewives"", and more, with characters that resemble Arnold Schwarzenegger, Woody Allen, and others. ""Tripping"" features the voices of former Playboy model Jenny McCarthy, who started on MTV, and once had her own prime-time television show. Today, she mainly romances Jim Carrey.  It also stars TV actor Stephen Root, seen recently as a gangster in ""No Country For Old Men"".  ""Tripping the Rift: The Movie"" is presented in an enhanced anamorphic widescreen 1.78:1 ratio. Colors are strong, and the black-and-white sequences are stunning. Audio is a 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround stereo in English using a 448 Kbps bitrate(the 2.0 version has almost as  much separation, but uses a 192 bitrate). Extras are tidy, with Scene Selections, a featurette with Jenny McCarthy, and three trailers.  Check this out. If there's anything that's hot on DVD, it's computer animation. And for about ninety minutes, this is hot. It's very fast, very funny, and after all, it has Jenny McCarthy.

1137414,AFLPMS5K3DZL5,B0012IX34Y,calmly,"[2, 3]","I didn't find this ""movie"" offensive but I did find it tasteless and tedious. And not a movie at all, being disjoint episodes. And why was the first episode in black-and-white, simply to make me appreciate the colors that followed? No question the animation was well-done as were the voices. But to what end? Someone for TV Guide may comment ""Think 'South Park' in Space!"" but nothing about this movie reminded me of South Park. Despite much simpler animation, I have almost always found South Park hilarious. Someone at Newsday is quoted as commenting ""Irreverent, Smart, and Raunchy ...Worth the Trip!"" I'd agree that this movie was irreverent and raunchy but smart? And not in a way of being raunchy that seemed funny to me.""Foul language!"" - big deal, will you pay for that? ""Senseless Violence!"" - not my cup of tea but I'll note there was little and it is, after all, cartoon-ish so it may not satisfy those of you who lust for something seeming more real. ""Gratuitous N*dity!"" - hardly even that even in this animation.I would have given up after 20 minutes but I wanted to see if ""Tripping"" were an acquired taste. This movie, unfortunately, didn't help me in any such acquisition, the final episode may have seemed the most pointless of all. What did amaze me is wondering why so many talented animation and voice people and investors would invest themselves in this. I assume the TV show had more to it and that any elements ""too extreme for broadcast TV"" were nothing of consequence for me. I was further amazed when I watched the extra about the making of ""Tripping"" to find how thrilled the ""voices"" were about this show - is that marketing? Certainly it was ""out there"" but there are so many ways to be ""out there"" and this one wasn't in any ""there"" that impressed me. This movie gives ""out there"" a bad name . If you enjoy funny ""out there"" I recommend Warhol'sWomen in Revolt: not animated but ""out there"" and truly funny to me.With the kind of continuity one expects from a movie, a better script, less or better tastelessness and less tedium, ""Tripping"" fine animation and voices had promise.

This ""movie"" is actually 3 episodes from the last season strung together with a thinly fleshed out plotline that is new to the movie. While the episodes are still great, that doesn't mean that they're great enough to string together for a movie. It's actually a bit of a ripoff. Sure, the movie original plotline isn't bad, but it was never really given the chance to shine on it's own.In order to string the episodes together better, the voices were redubbed & given lines that coincide with the movie plotline rather than the lines that were originally in the episodes. Once in a while you can see where the voices don't match up to the animation's lips. They do a relatively good job of making sure they match up, but you can't fix everything. Also, while I like Jenny McCarthy, she's not a very good Six. Her voice is just well... empty in this role. She lacks the warmth, intelligence, & sensuality that the previous actresses had while they were playing that role. Jenny just sounds like the biggest contribution she made to the role was showing up that day & trying to make her voice sound like the previous Sixes. (My question is why didn't they try a little harder to hire back one of the previous Sixes?) Let's face it, Six is one of the main reasons people watch, even if they're a straight girl. Her character is witty, sexy, caring, & ultimately the most intelligent personalities on the show. There's a lot to like in that character & she's survived many different voice actresses who have each brought something new to the character.

I liked it then - it had originality and style, with a good seasoning of profanity and cynical humour. I didn't pay too much attention when it turned into a TV series - I assumed that the new environment would rob it of any character and originality within a season (as it does for most things).When I saw that a movie had been produced, I must admit that my expectations were not high. When I watched the DVD, the el-cheapo title sequence didn't inspire confidence either.However, once the movie started - initially in black and white, no less - it soon became apparent that the production had lost none of its original charm. This is actually an amusing little movie; not great, but a decent way to pass an hour or so, and have a few laughs along the way.The film is episodic, with each scene parodying some earlier film or genre. The black and white section seems to be influenced by Frankenstein, for example. Tying the scenes together is a back-story involving a relentless android, with an Austrian accent, who is trying to kill the hero. Sound familiar? Of course, since Darth Bobo is involved, it's an android clown....The self-referential jokes, allusions and caricatures come thick and fast. The film is greatly enhanced if you have a working knowledge of the cinema, or at least the more popular side of it. It's worth playing a couple of times, just to find the references you missed first time around.Not a cartoon for the kids, though - not so much because of the occasional profanity, but mostly because they won't get many of the jokes.Great entertainment.",4,Reminiscent of early Fritz Lang,1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,1690,"['Just', 'kidding.Much', 'more', 'Eisenstein.I', 'remember', 'when', 'Tripping', 'Rift', 'was', 'just', 'five-minute', 'snippet', 'website', 'liked', 'then', 'had', 'originality', 'style', 'good', 'seasoning', 'profanity', 'cynical', 'humour', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'when', 'turned', 'TV', 'series', 'assumed', 'new', 'environment', 'would', 'rob', 'character', 'originality', 'season', 'most', 'things', '.When', 'saw', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'produced', 'must', 'admit', 'expectations', 'were', 'not', 'high', 'When', 'watched', 'DVD', 'el-cheapo', 'title', 'sequence', 'did', ""n't"", 'inspire', 'confidence', 'either.However', 'once', 'movie', 'started', 'initially', 'black', 'white', 'less', 'soon', 'became', 'apparent', 'production', 'had', 'lost', 'none', 'original', 'charm', 'actually', 'amusing', 'little', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'decent', 'way', 'pass', 'hour', 'so', 'have', 'few', 'laughs', 'way.The', 'film', 'episodic', 'scene', 'parodying', 'earlier', 'film', 'genre', 'black', 'white', 'section', 'be', 'influenced', 'Frankenstein', 'example', 'Tying', 'scenes', 'together', 'back-story', 'involving', 'relentless', 'android', 'Austrian', 'accent', 'who', 'trying', 'kill', 'hero', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'course', 'Darth', 'Bobo', 'involved', 'android', 'clown', '.The', 'self-referential', 'jokes', 'allusions', 'caricatures', 'come', 'thick', 'fast', 'film', 'greatly', 'enhanced', 'have', 'working', 'knowledge', 'cinema', 'least', 'more', 'popular', 'side', 'worth', 'playing', 'couple', 'times', 'just', 'find', 'references', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'around.Not', 'cartoon', 'kids', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'occasional', 'profanity', 'mostly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'many', 'jokes.Great', 'entertainment']","Tripping The Rift, Movie"

In contrast the former's nice looking computer animation and varyingly clever movie and TV parodies are mostly combined with foul language and crude sexual humor that usually ceases to be laugh out loud funny by one's early teens.  The result is both unsuitable for family viewing AND unwilling to push the envelope very far.  To take one example, jokes about Gratuitous Nudity might be funnier if their WERE some,... nudity that is.  Gratuitous NON-nudity seems more than a little pointless.The parodies were also somewhat uneven.  That ofYoung Frankensteinseemed rather forced; how DO you parody a parody after all?

In the past I'd seen comparisons to the likes of South Park (a favorite of mine) & other animated comedies so I was kinda interested in checking ""TTR"" out.  I saw that there was now an unrated movie available & thought what better place to start.The movie wasn't horrible, but by no means was the humor anywhere near the quality of South Park, or really any other animated comedy out there.  The humor in the show is really nothing more than a bunch of knee slappers, stuff that if you heard a little drum roll after words it wouldn't be out of place.  There's really nothing of any substance though & nothings gonna get anymore than a chuckle outta you, if even that.  There were quite a few good refferences to other Sci-Fi/Horror greats from the past, some were actually kinda funny & will be the most fun to watch for through out the film.  As far as the ""unrated"" rating is concerned, there's really no reason for it.  Ya, you'll get some dirty language (F-Bombs are dropped quite frequently), but that's about it.  The ""Senseless Violence & Gatuitous Nudity"" is no where to be found unless you count a couple green butts & 2 little owls heads popping.  That's not realy a big issue (don't know about anyone else, but cartoon nudity just doesn't seem to do it for me, LOL), but the cover to the movie kinda tries to make that a selling point & that just isn't true (which is kinda sleezy on Anchor Ba...er I mean ""Starz"" part).  As far as the language is concerned it really doesn't need to be there, it's like their cursing just to curse.  That's all fine & good, my mouth is just as filthy as the next guys, except it's almost as if they're expecting you to laugh just because the little purple blob says the ""F"" word.As far as the movie itself, I won't go into any plot details as not to spoil it for anyone interested in watching it.  I don't know for sure, as I've never seen the actual show, but it seems like the movie is nothing more than like 3 episodes strung together & something slapped in to make them all connect.  For instance, what goes on in the beginning of the movie has nothing to do with what's hapening in the end of the movie & just really had nothing to do with the plot.  Don't be expecting to get a full on movie experiance out of this & you'll be okay & I'm sure fans of the show will be right at home watching.In the end, would I recommend this?  Maybe as a rental, sure I'd probably recommend it, definately not as a purchase though.  I really can't imagine any need or wanting to watch this repeatedly.  To it's credit though, this is probably one of the best Sci-Fi channel related movies I've seen (believe me though when I say that ""that ain't sayin' much"").  In the end this is a descently mediocre Sci-Fi spoof that if you're wandering around Blockbuster for an hour & can't find anything else to rent this might be worth checking out.

Eh.First, the writing was poor. The vast majority of the jokes were predictable, hackneyed, and cliche. There was a loose plot line, which went mostly out the window for the major subplots. The subplots were basically three movie/tv parodies loosely scrapped together without much coherence.Of course, the box makes a big to-do over the fact that this is an unrated filth-fest. What they mean by this is that there is a lot of gratuitous swearing. I mean gratuitous in the real sense of the word - swearing for no apparent reason.I'm no prude but the swearing seemed to be shoehorned into the dialogue to provide shock value (which it didn't). How many times can you hear a character slap the f-word in front of the subject of his sentence before it becomes boring? Well, you're going to get that a lot. A good comedy writer could have a field day with flinging insults between characters, which makes it disappointing when they mostly fling standard expletives at each other.The comedic timing is way off (mostly too slow), and the dialogue seems cobbled together. I'm guessing the voice actors each recorded their lines separately and the sound editor did what he could to put them together.The CG animation is good and visually very interesting.The ""star studded"" voice cast includes ""stuttering"" John Melendez and Jenny McCarthy.The DVD extra is ""Making of Tripping the Rift"".

I think I would have appreciated this movie more if I had seen the series and was more involved with the characters and their development.In addition to the movie, there is a short ""making of"" featurette, and I enjoyed that as much as I did the movie (but then, I like the behind the scenes stuff). I would have liked even more of that. The animation is pretty good, as are the production values.It is truly funny. Not all of the humor is to my liking, but there are some great lines and situations. The subtle and not-so-subtle satire and parody is the best part, and I wish there was more of that in the blend. It is very irreverent, extremely nasty, gross at times, and mostly very silly. Think more Cheech and Chong than Firesign Theater.It is definitely NOT for kids, unless we are talking the ten year-old in a 25 year-old body (and I know a few who would love this). It is fast paced and not very deep, but then it is a comedy. Sort of sexy, gross, drive-by comedy.It has been likened to South Park, but I haven't ever watched that, so I can't comment on that comparison. One of the actors in the featurette describes it as Star Wars meets the porn industry. I would add in a healthy dose of The Three Stooges (now THAT dates me).It is not something I will watch over and over again, like Firefly, but I am definitely interested in seeing the TV series now.

I've appeared in plays where comedy is the main focus.So my humble opinion is not just that of the lay person.This is not a horrible movie. It has a lot of good stuff, unfortunately, most of it is in the first of the many blantant ripoffs of various movies/tv shows this film slides through.The least effective is the ham-fisted Desperate Housewives ripoff. But most of the film is a blur. One lame attempt at humor after another.The only one that had a lot of of the proper nudge-nudge, wink-wink is the silly and wonderous Young Frankenstein segment that opens the film. The biggest reason this section works is that they had a LOT to work with. Desperate Housewives is a hollow shell of a show, and this hollow shell of a movie only points that out.I enjoyed the first season of the show, and even though other seasons happened. The basic physics of the show have not changed. You have a idiot boss, Chode, who is at least as stupid as your average TV head of household. He spouts ugly, sexist, homophobic humor, even though he is the root cause of all his own problems. He can't keep himself under control.And like many TV protagonists, his eventual salvation is mostly a product of his own dumb luck.There is a modest overlay of a story (using aspects of Terminator 2) but this isn't a movie you're going to remember 5 minutes after it ends. I honestly can't recall many of the movies this thing rips off. I see the tag list and I don't remember hardly any of them.But if you liked the series, and this thing is on TV, there are worse ways to kill an hour and fifteen minutes.",2,Never lead with your strongest stuff,1208390400,"04 17, 2008",2008,1643,"['am', 'funny', 'guy', 'Professional', 'grade.I', ""'ve"", 'done', 'comedy', 'improv', ""'ve"", 'appeared', 'plays', 'where', 'comedy', 'main', 'focus.So', 'humble', 'opinion', 'not', 'just', 'lay', 'person.This', 'not', 'horrible', 'movie', 'lot', 'good', 'stuff', 'unfortunately', 'most', 'first', 'many', 'blantant', 'ripoffs', 'various', 'movies/tv', 'film', 'least', 'effective', 'ham-fisted', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'ripoff', 'most', 'film', 'blur', 'One', 'lame', 'attempt', 'humor', 'another.The', 'only', 'one', 'had', 'lot', 'proper', 'nudge-nudge', 'wink-wink', 'silly', 'wonderous', 'Young', 'Frankenstein', 'segment', 'film', 'biggest', 'reason', 'section', 'had', 'LOT', 'work', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'hollow', 'shell', 'show', 'hollow', 'shell', 'movie', 'only', 'out.I', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'even', 'other', 'seasons', 'happened', 'basic', 'physics', 'show', 'have', 'not', 'changed', 'have', 'idiot', 'boss', 'Chode', 'who', 'least', 'as', 'stupid', 'average', 'TV', 'head', 'household', 'ugly', 'sexist', 'homophobic', 'humor', 'even', 'root', 'cause', 'own', 'problems', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'control.And', 'many', 'TV', 'protagonists', 'eventual', 'salvation', 'mostly', 'product', 'own', 'dumb', 'modest', 'overlay', 'story', 'using', 'aspects', 'Terminator', '2', ""n't"", 'movie', ""'re"", 'going', 'remember', '5', 'minutes', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'many', 'movies', 'thing', 'see', 'tag', 'list', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'hardly', 'them.But', 'liked', 'series', 'thing', 'TV', 'are', 'worse', 'ways', 'kill', 'hour', 'fifteen', 'minutes']","Tripping The Rift, Movie"

Loria,"[0, 0]","Tripping the Rift, the CGI science fiction spoof, which began as a couple of internet shorts before airing on Canadian TV, then Sci Fi Channel, returns as an unrated DVD release with no holds barred. As raunchy and filled with gratuitous nudity as you'd expect, Tripping the Rift the Movie is 75 minutes of science fiction spoofs and gags consistent with the TV version.The cast returns for this original made for DVD release. Stephen Root, best known for Newsradio, again voices the morally bankrupt, over-sexed captain Chode of the Jupiter 42 ( nod to ""Lost in Space"" and ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."") The archetypical prissy gold robot parody of C-3PO, Gus,  again played by the great Maurice LaMarche (Futurama).The A.I. spaceship Bob, a parody of Hal from ""2001"" is Stuttering John Melendez. Also returning are Whip (Rick Jones) Chode's horny lizard nephew and T'nuk (Gayle Garfinkle) the nasty quadrupedal pilot. Let's not forget the android sex slave, played since the series creation by notable voices like: Patricia Beckmann and Terry Farrell (in both versions of the pilot) Gina Gershon, and Carmen Electra.The most recent voice of ""Six of Nine"" from season 3, Jenny McCarty.The story begins as the crew a planet in order protect a princess in a suspiciously Slavic setting down to the black in white genre touches. While the Young Frankenstein / Weekend at Bernies/ Moon over Parador spoof continues Chode is being stalked, in color, by a bulletproof cyborg clown on steroids. The homage to the Terminator continues as the parodies move onto the crew's relocation to the suburbs and Desperate Housewives. Darph Bobo, the supreme Dark Clown who wants to take over the universe, returns to evenge himself on Chode for taking advantage of his daughter Babette.Overall this DVD effort is as good as it's TV incarnation, it isn't so over-the-top that I could see it as a theatrical release, but it flow pretty good, although the ""I love Slovinia"" song is sort of lame.  Upshot is that fans of the series will love this, fans of adult cartoons like South Park will be okay with it, but casual sci-fi fans will likely take it or leave it.",3,Tripping again...uncensored,1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,2149,"['Tripping', 'Rift', 'CGI', 'science', 'fiction', 'spoof', 'began', 'couple', 'internet', 'shorts', 'airing', 'Canadian', 'TV', 'then', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Channel', 'unrated', 'DVD', 'release', 'barred', 'raunchy', 'filled', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Tripping', 'Rift', 'Movie', '75', 'minutes', 'science', 'fiction', 'spoofs', 'gags', 'consistent', 'TV', 'version.The', 'cast', 'returns', 'original', 'made', 'DVD', 'release', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'best', 'known', 'Newsradio', 'again', 'morally', 'bankrupt', 'over-sexed', 'captain', 'Chode', 'Jupiter', '42', 'nod', 'Lost', 'Space', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'archetypical', 'prissy', 'gold', 'robot', 'parody', 'C-3PO', 'Gus', 'again', 'played', 'great', 'Maurice', 'LaMarche', 'Futurama', '.The', 'A.I', 'spaceship', 'Bob', 'parody', 'Hal', '2001', 'Stuttering', 'John', 'Melendez', 'Also', 'returning', 'are', 'Whip', 'Rick', 'Jones', 'Chode', 'horny', 'lizard', 'nephew', ""T'nuk"", 'Gayle', 'Garfinkle', 'nasty', 'quadrupedal', 'pilot', 'Let', 'not', 'forget', 'android', 'sex', 'slave', 'played', 'series', 'creation', 'notable', 'voices', 'Patricia', 'Beckmann', 'Terry', 'Farrell', 'versions', 'pilot', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'Carmen', 'Electra.The', 'most', 'recent', 'voice', 'Six', 'Nine', 'season', '3', 'Jenny', 'McCarty.The', 'story', 'crew', 'planet', 'order', 'protect', 'princess', 'suspiciously', 'Slavic', 'setting', 'down', 'black', 'white', 'genre', 'touches', 'Young', 'Frankenstein', '/', 'Weekend', 'Bernies/', 'Moon', 'Parador', 'spoof', 'Chode', 'being', 'stalked', 'color', 'bulletproof', 'cyborg', 'clown', 'steroids', 'homage', 'Terminator', 'parodies', 'move', 'crew', 'relocation', 'suburbs', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'Darph', 'Bobo', 'supreme', 'Dark', 'Clown', 'who', 'take', 'over', 'universe', 'returns', 'evenge', 'Chode', 'taking', 'advantage', 'daughter', 'Babette.Overall', 'DVD', 'effort', 'as', 'good', 'TV', 'incarnation', ""n't"", 'so', 'over-the-top', 'could', 'see', 'theatrical', 'release', 'flow', 'pretty', 'good', 'love', 'Slovinia', 'song', 'sort', 'lame', 'Upshot', 'fans', 'series', 'will', 'love', 'fans', 'adult', 'cartoons', 'South', 'Park', 'will', 'be', 'okay', 'casual', 'sci-fi', 'fans', 'will', 'likely', 'take', 'leave']","Tripping The Rift, Movie"

After narrowly escaping a sticky situation involving a murdered princess they were hired to protect, they find themselves on the run from a Terminator-like clown robot on a mission to destroy sex-addicted Chode before he commits a particularly offensive act. Will Chode's struggle to survive interfere with his throwing the thriftiest birthday bash ever?I have to admit that this was my first time really sitting and watching an entire tale of the computer-animated saga ""Tripping the Rift"". One would think ""The Movie"" would be an okay way to be introduced to it. However, I had sampled bits of the TV series a few times before and judged it to be overloaded with sex jokes that simply weren't very funny, and the movie turned out to be exactly that way too. The making-of featurette on the DVD, which has some great interviews from a cast that boasts some well-respected voice talents like Maurice LaMarche and Stephen Root, gives the impression that the series itself might be a bit smarter than this rather messy movie, but I'd have to see it to believe it. There's really nothing clever about this film at all. Besides mostly unfunny sex jokes and gay jokes galore, the only other real attempt at humor is through spoofing famous films and TV shows. Unfortunately, this also isn't done too well most of the time. The Terminator parodying wasn't bad, but the rest was hit and miss, and mostly miss. For example, in the beginning, they do a ""Young Frankenstein"" spoof. Look, you can't really spoof a spoof. It's not that funny. The best you can do in that case is rip-off jokes. The filmmakers also seem to think that foul language is hilarious for adult animation viewers. Look, I love some movies that have very foul language, but never for the foul language itself. In this film it seemed totally gratuitous. Now and then, okay, but nearly every other world? I wasn't buying it. In the end, it hurt the film. And, with all this sex talk, they could have made it a lot more titillating. It really wasn't very. The ""sexy"" females really never were very attractive, not even Chode's own sex slave, Six, whose face and hair are so awful the overdone rest of her doesn't matter much. Of course, I've never gone for the porn star look, and I'm sure that's what they were going for. Overall, you might get a few chuckles out of this one, but it's by no means a ""must see"". If you're looking for animation geared more towards adults, check out the original ""Heavy Metal"", or other classics like ""American Pop"" and ""Rock and Rule"", certain shows from Cartoon Network's Adult Swim (Futurama is a better answer to this sort of humor, and Family Guy is great too), or the huge selection of Anime out there (which is a much better place to look if you want something sexy). And don't underestimate the smartness and adult-appeal of stuff you may think is just for kids at first glance, like Disney or Garfield. Anyone can enjoy animation, but there is far better animation out there than this one. It's okay for one viewing if you're really curious, and I suppose you might love it if you love the ""Tripping the Rift"" the TV show.

The principal character is Chode, a sex-obsessed purple alien, who goes traveling the galaxy with his little crew of aliens and a robot named Six (who is in the form of a beautiful woman).  Their adventures are crude parodies of such films and TV shows as Young Frankenstein and Desperate Housewives, with a Terminator-ish plot stringing the tales together.Tripping the Rift is apparently designed for that narrow demographic of teenage boys who have passed puberty but have not developed the intellectual capacity to realize that this supposed animated comedy offers nothing more than recycled jokes and dozens of chesty women.  If you like comic sci-fi, try out Futurama.  If you like tasteless humor - and I often do - try South Park or Family Guy.

There are some funny moments though, including a Desperate Housewives spoof that may put fans of that show in an uproar.  Fans of the show will also be happy to know that many familiar voices return here as well, but for the most part, Tripping the Rift: The Movie is a disappointment.

I like science fiction, parody, and comedy, all of which this movie purport to be. Unfortunately the film is nothing but a boring 75 minute exhibition of toilet humor with no coherent plot, and characters that were universally loathsome. It's rare that five minutes into a film I am wishing the entire cast to be annihilated in a cataclysmic event, but such was the case here. Although it is only 75 minutes long, it took me five sittings to get through this steaming pile.The film has excellent animation. That is where my praise ends. The film features a pointless blend of color and black and white, and attempts to parody numerous earlier works and includes elements reminiscent of ""Star Trek"", ""Star Wars"", ""Alien"", ""Saturday Night Fever"", ""Frankenstein"" (obviously), and every Tim Burton movie ever made, but on balance reminded me mostly of a cross between ""Weekend at Bernie's"" and ""Killer Klowns From Outer Space."" The film consists of numerous subplots (clown pregnancy, Slovenian Princess reanimation, and even less tasteful delvings into suicide and flatus), none of which go anywhere. Just when the plot seems to be becoming coherent it veers wildly in a new direction. Perhaps that could have something to do with the origin of the film as multiple episodes of a Canadian television show sliced and diced together. Sound good? It's not.When I bought the film I thought it could be a creative and funny satire. Instead it's a great glob of preadolescent non-humor that makes little sense, utterly fails to entertain, and provokes outright hostility to the characters.

So this review is from that point of view and if you are a longtime fan of the show you may want to skip this review.For those that haven't seen the show, it wants to believe it is South Park meets Star Trek in that the characters are fowl mouthed in a setting of space. But the planets that they visit should look familiar because they are all based on pop culture. First the crew head to a black and white setting reminiscent of the old Frankenstein, followed by trips to an Indiana Jones themed planet before going low key on Hysteria Lane surround by desperate, albeit green, housewives.The lead cartoon Chode (voiced by Office Space's Stephen Root) is your typical purple captain who cares more about sex than, well, just about everything else combines. Which could explain the inclusion of Six (voiced by Singled Out's Jenny McCarthy) in the crew, a sex slave cyborg. Rounding out the rest of the crew is Chode's inept nephew Whip, T'nuk, who sounds like a combination of every lunch lady ever (prudes and females in general may not want to spell her name backwards), and the ambiguously gay robot Gus. Although they should have learned from Ace and Gary, ambiguously gay dudes are much funnier in pairs.Also thrown in the mix for the movie is a killer robot clown from the future sent back in time to kill Chode. Yes this is an obvious Terminator reference, but instead of going into a biker bar to get cloths, it is a bar that launches plenty of Gus jokes. There are plenty of decent laughs throughout the movie that it almost makes me want to hunt down where the television show airs.

1137454,A11JU33HMT5XPU,B0012IX34Y,"S. Lawrenz ""Lendorien""","[2, 2]","Tripping the Rift is a TV show originally created as a short 3d animated film named ""Love and Darph"" in 1998. The concept was picked up by the Sci-Fi channel in 2002 and aired in 2004 through 2005. It was canceled and was picked up again in 2007. It has had a total of three seasons so far. The third season was not aired in the United States.As a television show, it tends to rely on low humor, site gags, sex jokes and potty humor.  Plots of the show often revolved around the libido of the purple blob, Chode, the show's central character. His crew, which includes a loudmouth quadruped alien, a sex-bot, a gay robot and a lizard, provide zany antics to complicate things.  The antagonist to Chode is his arch-nemesis, Bobo the clown, a goofy Darth Vader type character with a clown-head and a lisp.Despite the low brow humor, as a show, at least for the first season, it was somewhat original and clever. It's off the wall humor that made fun of famous sci-fi films and TV along with goofy story lines created a somewhat entertaining show.  I always saw it as something of a guilty pleasure.About the movie/dvd:Tripping the Rift: The Movie, so far as I can tell is at least four episodes of the third season of the show shoehorned together into a movie in an attempt to sell something to US audiences. The four episodes that are sliced and diced together are ""Chode Eraser,"" ""Skankenstein,""  ""Raiders of the Lost Crock of */@?#!,"" and ""Witness Protection.""Unfortunately, if this is what the show has become, I must say I'm rather glad it's not being inflicted on US audiences any more. I have not seen any of the episodes of the third season of the show, but I can say that based on what I've seen of the movie, it's lost all of its charm and much of its humor.The writing has gone downhill in a major way with the plots now just random parodies on TV shows and movies with very little in the way of original humor. The jokes and gags are formulaic and clich&eacute;'d.  The first season of the show was far more original, and funny, both in plot and humor.Even more noticeable is the voicework by Jenny McCarthy, who now plays Six (replacing Gina Gershon and Carmon Electra). McCarthy is really bad in the role. Gina Gershon gave Six bite, a sexy tone and interesting character. McCarthy sounds bored and toneless. Of course, writing doesn't help any.So far as the plot of the movie, while Tripping the Rift's brand of comedy is not something you can expect to be strong on plot, this movie hardly has one at all. The story involves a terminator-like clown chasing after Chode to kill him, but the rest of the film ends up with the characters jumping into one unrelated b-story after another. Nothing fits together and undoubtedly, this Frankenstein like mess hurts everything, since they have no relation to one another at all.I suppose that's what you get when you cram four 30 minute episodes into a 75 minute film. It certainly was unfunny and boring. I think I laughed out loud once during the entire thing, and the laugh I made was mostly a snort.On the DVD side, this release is fairly barebones. It includes the movie, a trailer, and a making of featurette. The featurette doesn't say much, though you get to see what some of the voice actors look like.Bottom line:Overall, this is one to avoid. It's an unfunny movie made up of 4 episodes of the show that don't fit together.

I hear it's good and this was a fine movie but I began to lose interest at the last third. The movie begins with a Terminator parody complete with the Clown version of Ah-Nold stealing his leather jacket from a gay bar. Meanwhile the aliens are on a planet with a soon-to-be murdered Princess and a lot of set jokes from Young Frankenstein. I would call it a parody but it's more of an homage to a great movie.A half hour later, the situation changes to more Terminator jokes. The Clown Terminator pulls the ""I'll be back"" move but then crashes into the car-proof glass of the station and that was enough for a chuckle. And then for no apparent reason, the movie starts mocking Desperate Housewives, only most of the Housewives want to have sex with the main octopus thing.The animation is great. It's an enjoyable movie, but too many movies have done the parodies of other movies to the point where one worries about ever seeing a comedy that isn't a take-off of the last dozen movies. Granted, these parodies are nowhere near as lazy or stupid as the Epic Movie/Meet the Spartans/That Superhero Thing jokes, but there's nothing particularly compelling or satiric about depicting the characters of Desperate Housewives as horny foul-mouthed harpies when that's not altogether far off from the real show.Still it's an enjoyable romp and I'm sure that Tripping the Rift fans will love it.",4,It's funny but I'm exhausted by this kind of humor,1206576000,"03 27, 2008",2008,1417,"['have', 'never', 'seen', 'series', 'hear', 'good', 'was', 'fine', 'movie', 'began', 'lose', 'interest', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'Terminator', 'parody', 'complete', 'Clown', 'version', 'Ah-Nold', 'stealing', 'leather', 'jacket', 'gay', 'bar', 'Meanwhile', 'aliens', 'are', 'planet', 'soon-to-be', 'murdered', 'Princess', 'lot', 'set', 'jokes', 'Young', 'Frankenstein', 'would', 'call', 'parody', 'more', 'homage', 'great', 'movie.A', 'half', 'hour', 'later', 'situation', 'more', 'Terminator', 'jokes', 'Clown', 'Terminator', ""'ll"", 'be', 'back', 'move', 'then', 'crashes', 'car-proof', 'glass', 'station', 'was', 'enough', 'chuckle', 'then', 'apparent', 'reason', 'movie', 'mocking', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'only', 'most', 'Housewives', 'want', 'have', 'sex', 'main', 'octopus', 'thing.The', 'animation', 'great', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'done', 'parodies', 'other', 'movies', 'point', 'where', 'one', 'ever', 'seeing', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'take-off', 'last', 'dozen', 'movies', 'Granted', 'parodies', 'are', 'nowhere', 'lazy', 'stupid', 'Epic', 'Movie/Meet', 'Spartans/That', 'Superhero', 'Thing', 'jokes', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'compelling', 'satiric', 'depicting', 'characters', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'horny', 'foul-mouthed', 'harpies', 'when', 'not', 'altogether', 'far', 'real', 'show.Still', 'enjoyable', 'romp', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Tripping', 'Rift', 'fans', 'will', 'love']","Tripping The Rift, Movie"

Based on a series primarily showcased on the SciFi Channel, Tripping the Rift was a show that rarely had a plot to give, had many a brash joke to throw to its audience, and did not ignore the idea that sexuality sells - even in animated form. The movie is more of the same, only the movie has more of a plotline to give and many of the jokes seem less like one-liners and more like they were thought-out.Will you like the movie? Well, I wouldn't go as far as calling it art but, if you enjoyed the series or like some of your jokes really really wrong then you might like this. I personally found the movie to be a lot of fun but have to say that it lived up to its negative lashings as well.So - maybe you might rent it sometime or find it on TV but it isn't a classic and I can't say that you should look into it without knowing what it is you are checking into first.Basically, buyer beware and then some.",3,It REALLY Depends on what you call humor.,1207526400,"04 7, 2008",2008,957,"['Tripping', 'Rift', 'get', 'what', 'expect', 'Based', 'series', 'primarily', 'showcased', 'SciFi', 'Channel', 'Tripping', 'Rift', 'was', 'show', 'rarely', 'had', 'plot', 'give', 'had', 'many', 'brash', 'joke', 'throw', 'audience', 'did', 'not', 'ignore', 'idea', 'sexuality', 'even', 'animated', 'form', 'movie', 'more', 'same', 'only', 'movie', 'more', 'plotline', 'give', 'many', 'jokes', 'seem', 'less', 'one-liners', 'more', 'were', 'thought-out.Will', 'movie', 'Well', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'far', 'calling', 'art', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'jokes', 'really', 'really', 'wrong', 'then', 'might', 'like', 'personally', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'lot', 'fun', 'have', 'say', 'lived', 'up', 'negative', 'lashings', 'well.So', 'maybe', 'might', 'rent', 'sometime', 'find', 'TV', ""n't"", 'classic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'should', 'look', 'knowing', 'what', 'are', 'checking', 'first.Basically', 'buyer', 'beware', 'then']","Tripping The Rift, Movie"
