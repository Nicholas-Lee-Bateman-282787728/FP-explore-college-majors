1118884,A1WPCLH2ZACWPH,B000YDMPBA,"Charlie B. ""Charlie""","[3, 4]","Cover starts with Valerie Maas (Aujanue Ellis) being held for the murder of popular R&B; singer Ryan Chambers (Leon).  She contests that she is innocent in the murder but an over-zealous D.A (Clifton Davis) is trying to seek her conviction to help boost his credibility in an upcoming election. She begins to tell her story through a series of flashbacks during the interregation to Detective Hick (Lou Gossett Jr.).Valerie is a 'happily' married woman from ATL who gives up her career as a photographer and moves to Philly with her daughter when her psychiatrist husband Dutch (Raz Adoti) takes a higher paying job there thanks to college friends Kevin and Monica Wilson (Roger Smith and Paula Jai Parker).  Hard times abound when Dutch is denied the salary that was initially promised to him by Monica due to funding issues at the hospital, and it seems that he is struggling with this as head of the family through pillow talk and his reluctancy to join a local church suggested to them by Valerie's good friend Zahara (Vivica Fox).  Valerie is more interested in Dutch's relationship with Monica, who is very seductive and charismatic with Dutch with every encounter.  She is only side-tracked by Ryan Chambers, who is equally seductive and charismatic with her during the Wilson's anniversary party, but questions Dutch and Monica's involvement even more once she finds a condom in Dutch's wallet one afternoon.  Zahara, who vows to stand by her friend, does some detective work and presents Valerie with photos that suggest Dutch is having an affair with Monica.  Valerie, who is livid, confronts Dutch, who comes up with every logical explanation in the book to calm her suspicions in a heated argument.  Valerie however is still not convinced.  Dutch shows up unexpectantly at Ryan's home where Valerie is doing a photo shoot for him and catches the two in compromising positions, accusing her of trying to get back at him.  It isn't until the pariah of Valerie and Zahara's womens church group Charlotte gives Valerie a key to a hotel room and insists that she needs to know the truth that Valerie discovers Dutch is having an affair, and it's not with Monica, but with another man.  Suddenly, many secrets are revealed and Valerie must make a powerful decision concerning her marriage.PROS: The script was believable because of the top-notch notable African American cast who brought these characters to life.  We all have or know of a friend like Zahara, for example--crazy as all get out and down-to-Earth, willing to have your back when need be.  Or the older woman at church like Sister Honeycomb who means well, but still comes off ignorant and out of touch.  I was impressed with Raz Adoti, someone who I'm only used to seeing in action flicks such as Resident Evil and Doom.  There were no raunchy sex scenes between men and you got the point during the big reveal scene, which I respected.  Valerie's reactions that followed upon finding out her husband's infidelity were so human you might forget that Aujanue Ellis was only acting.CONS:1. The movie was very predictable and foolish at times despite the twists and turns that were presented to throw the viewer off.  It's so obvious who Dutch is not having an affair with as obvious as they try to make it.  The confrontation scene between Valerie and Monica was foolish, even if it was used to show how her prints got on the gun.  Dutch's father bailing him out of jail and then beating him up on the way out was another idiotic scene.  Valerie telling everyone at the womens group meeting in the church about her husband's infidelity with another man--of all people to tell--is poor, and I just couldn't see a woman scorned in such a way confiding something like that with so many people not close to her.  The babysitter always standing at the front door during Valerie's arrival home everytime was laughable; at first, you might suspect that she is a housekeeper or something.  The spectacle of a rant Kevin makes on the streets of Philly to Dutch once the word is out about the extent of his infidelity was more comedy.2. I think the movie would've been just as good without the cheesy murder plot.  It should've definitely been left out because it wasn't needed.  There was such a gap in between after Valerie found out about Dutch's double life and the murder that I just felt this was something thrown in to spice up the script and not much thought was really given to it.  You didn't get to see how she got caught, how her family was affected...and how is it that the murder investigation focuses on her when she was one of three people who had access to the gun in the movie?3. While I appreciate the intellectual and ignorant conversation that was brought up involving homosexuality, the 'DL' phenomena, HIV/AIDS, and the Black church, there were still many stereotypes presented in the film.  Zahara's friend Greg was the stereotypical flamboyant and emotionally sensitive gay man.  There was also this crazy scene in the film that is repeated at the end to bring a realization/conclusion to the viewer where a married man hits on Greg and Dutch by offering to blow an eyelash out of their eye.  I died of laughter--is this supposed to be the tell-tell sign that a man is on the 'DL'?I heard so many people talking about this movie over the Summer and refused to take a chance and pay the 20-something dollars it was initially on sale for, and could never seem to rent it because it was never available, but finally broke when I saw it went on sale for only $7.99 a week ago.  It is definitely a decent made-for-DVD Black movie I must admit, entertaining with a few flaws, but touches on a very strong subject within the African American community.  A very good conversation piece, watch it with a group of people like I did and it's sure to get you talking.",4,Entertaining--Yes!--But Could've Been Alot Better!!!,1221350400,"09 14,

1118887,A218J58CFFQOPW,B000YDMPBA,D. Myatt,"[12, 17]","Sadly, truthfully, this film deserves no four star reviews; I recommend you ignore them all if seriously considering seeing this project. It's indeed packed with familiar faces: Vivica Foxx, Leon, Lou Gossett, Jr, Roger G. Smith (the film's brightest shining star), Aunjanue Ellis, Paula Jai Parker, Clifton Davis, even Pattie Labelle. However, the direction - by Bill Duke - leaves much to be desired. Duke knows better; he should be ashamed of himself. He slums his way through this thing, knowing it would never hit the mainstream, knowing it was destined to lazily go straight to DVD, knowing its intended audience is the not-too-selective church crowd. Overall, the acting was really bad: the male lead simply can't act and his utter absence of charisma makes him interesting to watch simply for that reason (I pray I never see him in anything else ever again). Roger G. Smith and Leon best bring their roles to life, saving themselves (along with Ellis, I guess) from being lumped-in with all the other actors who are either over-the-top (Parker and Foxx), underplayed and forgettable (Gossett) or simply too bad to mention (the kid who plays the couple's daughter - sorry - and the disturbed wife of Leon's character). And it's all too bad, because the subject matter is an important and timely one, but it's handled so recklessly.My family and I found ourselves routinely rewinding and laughing at spots that clearly weren't intended to be humorous. And the edits were atrocious - sloppily thrown together in the most heavy-handed manner. The poor edits, lazy lighting, sorry sound and myopic cinematography would all be forgivable if the film, in the end, somehow came together as whole - but no. In the end, Cover comes off as an insult to gay men (by the way, didn't the whole ""three-finger-snaps"" thing die-out after the In Living Color ""Men of Film"" sketches aired on TV almost two decades ago?), the church, Christians in general, wives, the city of Philly, Bill Duke, and most of the actors involved.This movie essentially suffers from what I term ""Tyler Perry Syndrome"" - which describes an intrinsic hunger in Christians and people of color so desperate to see their stories, their lives and experiences, nuanced, and with a verisimilitude to which they can relate, celebrate and call their own -- that they are willing to lower their cinematic standards - or downright dismiss them altogether -- and settle for and embrace films that are in many regards inferior, and thus offensive.",2,A Well-Meaning Mess of a Movie!,1242777600,"05 20, 2009",2009,2501,"['Sadly', 'truthfully', 'film', 'four', 'star', 'reviews', 'recommend', 'ignore', 'seriously', 'considering', 'seeing', 'project', 'indeed', 'packed', 'familiar', 'Vivica', 'Foxx', 'Leon', 'Lou', 'Gossett', 'Jr', 'Roger', 'G.', 'Smith', 'film', 'brightest', 'shining', 'star', 'Aunjanue', 'Ellis', 'Paula', 'Jai', 'Parker', 'Clifton', 'Davis', 'even', 'Pattie', 'Labelle', 'However', 'direction', 'Bill', 'Duke', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'Duke', 'better', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'slums', 'way', 'thing', 'knowing', 'would', 'never', 'hit', 'mainstream', 'knowing', 'was', 'destined', 'lazily', 'go', 'straight', 'DVD', 'knowing', 'intended', 'audience', 'not-too-selective', 'church', 'crowd', 'Overall', 'acting', 'was', 'really', 'bad', 'male', 'lead', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'utter', 'absence', 'charisma', 'interesting', 'watch', 'simply', 'reason', 'pray', 'never', 'see', 'anything', 'else', 'ever', 'again', 'Roger', 'G.', 'Smith', 'Leon', 'best', 'bring', 'roles', 'life', 'saving', 'Ellis', 'guess', 'being', 'lumped-in', 'other', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'over-the-top', 'Parker', 'Foxx', 'underplayed', 'forgettable', 'Gossett', 'simply', 'too', 'bad', 'mention', 'kid', 'who', 'couple', 'daughter', 'sorry', 'disturbed', 'wife', 'Leon', 'character', 'too', 'bad', 'subject', 'matter', 'important', 'timely', 'one', 'handled', 'so', 'recklessly.My', 'family', 'found', 'routinely', 'rewinding', 'laughing', 'spots', 'clearly', 'were', ""n't"", 'intended', 'be', 'humorous', 'edits', 'were', 'atrocious', 'sloppily', 'together', 'most', 'heavy-handed', 'manner', 'poor', 'edits', 'lazy', 'lighting', 'sorry', 'sound', 'myopic', 'cinematography', 'would', 'all', 'be', 'forgivable', 'film', 'end', 'somehow', 'came', 'together', 'whole', 'end', 'Cover', 'off', 'insult', 'gay', 'men', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'whole', 'three-finger-snaps', 'thing', 'die-out', 'Living', 'Color', 'Men', 'Film', 'sketches', 'aired', 'TV', 'almost', 'two', 'decades', 'church', 'Christians', 'general', 'wives', 'city', 'Philly', 'Bill', 'Duke', 'most', 'actors', 'involved.This', 'movie', 'essentially', 'what', 'term', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'Syndrome', 'intrinsic', 'hunger', 'Christians', 'people', 'color', 'so', 'desperate', 'see', 'stories', 'lives', 'experiences', 'nuanced', 'verisimilitude', 'can', 'relate', 'celebrate', 'call', 'own', 'are', 'willing', 'lower', 'cinematic', 'standards', 'downright', 'dismiss', 'altogether', 'settle', 'embrace', 'films', 'are', 'many', 'regards', 'inferior', 'thus', 'offensive']",Cover Repackaged

It deals with a lot of subjects that the black community is afraid or unwilling to discuss. Bill Duke (The Director) brings these subjects to the light and puts it right in your face. I do agree that the murder plot within this story was kind of distracting at times, but it all came together eventually, and it ultimately makes you re-think about the life you've led and who your sexual partners are. It sheds light on HIV and being tested, and it also exposes the ""DL"" lifestyle with black men who are secretly homosexual men who lead perfectly ""normal"" married hetrosexual lives in public, but they also secretly sleep with men. This movie also reveals that the reason for this behavior is that they are really afraid to be exposed because of the ridicule and persecution that they face from not only the community, but the church itself as well. This is definitely a topic that nobody wanted to touch, so I applaude Bill Duke for having the courage to go there. Let me just say that this movie is told in flashback fashion, so you must be paying close attention. Plus, this movie has an all star cast basically and you'll know what I mean if you watch a lot of black Cinema. There's Vivica A. Fox, Louis Gossest Jr., Clifton Davis (from Amen), Aunjanue Ellis, Paula Jai Parker and Leon (who I forgot was actually capable of real acting instead of just doing more biographies of singers and singing groups). This movie starts off with a woman named Valerie Maas being interrogated in the police station about a murder. The thing is, I think they mislead you intentionally into thinking the murder is her own husband, but in reality it's one of her husband's lover who's actually been murdered. I do have to get one gripe off my chest though, I do find it misleading that Dutch had been secretly sleeping with Ryan Chambers and his friend Kevin obviously (from my understanding of the movie anyway) but after he's caught by his wife Valerie she asks him if he used protection, and he admits not all the time or something to that effect. O.K! We find out that Ryan is HIV positive by his own admission, but somehow, after Dutch and Valerie both get tested the test come back negative. I don't see that was possible if he was messing around with Ryan too, and he obviously was by what they showed us. I had to get that out because it really bothered me that he was caught messing with an HIV positive man, but neither him or his wife was infected...I DON'T BUY THAT! However, with that said, it was a good movie. I wish I knew what happend to Monica (Kevin's wife) after her breakdown because they don't show her again.",3,I liked it!!!,1231200000,"01 6, 2009",2009,2741,"['wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'overboard', 'praises', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'subjects', 'black', 'community', 'afraid', 'unwilling', 'discuss', 'Bill', 'Duke', 'Director', 'subjects', 'light', 'right', 'face', 'do', 'agree', 'murder', 'plot', 'story', 'was', 'kind', 'distracting', 'times', 'came', 'together', 'eventually', 'ultimately', 're-think', 'life', ""'ve"", 'led', 'who', 'sexual', 'partners', 'are', 'light', 'HIV', 'being', 'tested', 'also', 'DL', 'lifestyle', 'black', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'secretly', 'homosexual', 'men', 'who', 'lead', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'married', 'hetrosexual', 'lives', 'public', 'also', 'secretly', 'sleep', 'men', 'movie', 'also', 'reason', 'behavior', 'are', 'really', 'afraid', 'be', 'exposed', 'ridicule', 'persecution', 'face', 'not', 'only', 'community', 'church', 'as', 'well', 'definitely', 'topic', 'nobody', 'wanted', 'touch', 'applaude', 'Bill', 'Duke', 'having', 'courage', 'go', 'there', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'movie', 'told', 'flashback', 'fashion', 'must', 'be', 'paying', 'close', 'attention', 'movie', 'star', 'cast', 'basically', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'watch', 'lot', 'black', 'Cinema', 'Vivica', 'A', 'Fox', 'Louis', 'Gossest', 'Jr.', 'Clifton', 'Davis', 'Amen', 'Aunjanue', 'Ellis', 'Paula', 'Jai', 'Parker', 'Leon', 'who', 'forgot', 'was', 'actually', 'capable', 'real', 'acting', 'instead', 'just', 'doing', 'more', 'biographies', 'singers', 'singing', 'groups', 'movie', 'woman', 'named', 'Valerie', 'Maas', 'being', 'interrogated', 'police', 'station', 'murder', 'thing', 'think', 'mislead', 'intentionally', 'thinking', 'murder', 'own', 'husband', 'reality', 'one', 'husband', 'lover', 'who', 'actually', 'been', 'murdered', 'do', 'have', 'get', 'one', 'gripe', 'chest', 'do', 'find', 'misleading', 'Dutch', 'had', 'been', 'secretly', 'sleeping', 'Ryan', 'Chambers', 'friend', 'Kevin', 'obviously', 'understanding', 'movie', 'anyway', 'caught', 'wife', 'Valerie', 'used', 'protection', 'not', 'time', 'something', 'effect', 'find', 'out', 'Ryan', 'HIV', 'positive', 'own', 'admission', 'somehow', 'Dutch', 'Valerie', 'get', 'tested', 'test', 'come', 'back', 'negative', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'was', 'possible', 'was', 'messing', 'around', 'Ryan', 'too', 'obviously', 'was', 'what', 'showed', 'had', 'get', 'out', 'really', 'bothered', 'was', 'caught', 'messing', 'HIV', 'positive', 'man', 'wife', 'was', 'infected', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'BUY', 'THAT', 'However', 'said', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'wish', 'knew', 'what', 'happend', 'Monica', 'Kevin', 'wife', 'breakdown', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'again']",Cover Repackaged

Aunjanue Ellis plays a deeply religious woman whose life and marriage fall apart when she discovers that her husband (Razaaq Adoti) is actually a closeted homosexual.  This leads to a great deal of emotional trauma for both the wife and the husband - as well  as to a patently absurd and wholly unnecessary murder subplot that's used to frame the story.There's no question that this is a well-meaning and well-intentioned film, but its attempt to deal honestly with a serious social issue all too often falls victim to slickery and overwrought melodramatics.  Many a scene will have you rolling your eyes in incredulity and disbelief, even while conceding that some of the points the movie is making are indeed insightful and valid.  And, commendably, the movie does give a fair hearing to each of its genuinely torn and conflicted characters.
