More stylish and eccentric than the ""Oceans 11-13"" film series this show loosely resembles.I am not always a big fun of British shows. This one is a rollicking, yet thoughtful experience. As a fan of both the other seasons as well, what I was pleasantly surprised to see was the continuation of the show's daring to play with classic genre styles during the course of the stories. For example, during an episode in which they briefly refer to the early 1900s, the characters, for a few moments, in sort of dream vignettes, are immersing themselves in early 1900s garb and mannerisms and these visions are filmed in the style of what a movie would look like during this early era. These flashes into different times and different cultures give the show a truly unique edge, and the transitions from the ""dreamlike"" states back into modern day are seamless and refreshing.Crisp writing, witty interchanges, moral dilemmas, and fascinating con games make for a great show to look forward to relaxing to at the end of the day. And thankfully, ""Hustle"" still doesn't take itself too seriously. I like that they still leave plenty of room for a certain thing most of us don't get enough of...fun.",5,Don't let the fact that it's a British show scare you off,1188000000,"08 25, 2007",2007,1272,"['Thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'characters', 'Deeply', 'engrossing', 'storylines', 'plot', 'twists', 'More', 'stylish', 'eccentric', '11-13', 'film', 'series', 'show', 'loosely', 'resembles.I', 'am', 'not', 'always', 'big', 'fun', 'British', 'shows', 'one', 'rollicking', 'yet', 'thoughtful', 'experience', 'fan', 'other', 'seasons', 'well', 'what', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'see', 'was', 'continuation', 'show', 'daring', 'play', 'classic', 'genre', 'styles', 'course', 'stories', 'example', 'episode', 'briefly', 'refer', 'early', '1900s', 'characters', 'few', 'moments', 'sort', 'dream', 'vignettes', 'are', 'immersing', 'early', '1900s', 'garb', 'mannerisms', 'visions', 'are', 'filmed', 'style', 'what', 'movie', 'would', 'look', 'early', 'era', 'flashes', 'different', 'times', 'different', 'cultures', 'give', 'show', 'truly', 'unique', 'edge', 'transitions', 'dreamlike', 'back', 'modern', 'day', 'are', 'seamless', 'refreshing.Crisp', 'writing', 'witty', 'interchanges', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'fascinating', 'con', 'games', 'make', 'great', 'show', 'look', 'forward', 'relaxing', 'end', 'day', 'thankfully', 'Hustle', 'still', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'like', 'still', 'leave', 'plenty', 'room', 'certain', 'thing', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'fun']",N/A

There is one clinker in the bunch that strains credulity more than usual (a mark develops amnesia), but this season also features one of the best episodes of the series so far--Mickey (Adrian Lester) and Danny (Marc Warren) square off in a challenge of grifting skills: both are abandoned naked in the middle of town at noon to see who can accumulate the most by the end of the day.  I've read that Lester left the show before season 4, so it'll be interesting to see what has become of the show when that season is released.",4,What a great show!,1194739200,"11 11, 2007",2007,612,"['terrific', 'season', 'clever', 'cons', 'surprise', 'endings', 'lots', 'laughs', 'one', 'clinker', 'bunch', 'credulity', 'more', 'usual', 'mark', 'amnesia', 'season', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'Mickey', 'Adrian', 'Lester', 'Danny', 'Marc', 'Warren', 'square', 'off', 'challenge', 'grifting', 'skills', 'are', 'abandoned', 'naked', 'middle', 'town', 'noon', 'see', 'who', 'can', 'accumulate', 'most', 'end', 'day', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Lester', 'left', 'show', 'season', '4', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'become', 'show', 'when', 'season', 'released']",N/A

Do you enjoy clever writing, terrfic acting, fabulous plots and fun twists at the end? Then the ""Hustle"" series is for you! For all too brief a time, AMC was airing them on Wednesday nights here in CA. But alas, they are now missing from the line-up, and I'm afraid that nothing so far in the new season is as fun to watch as this show. You must pay attention to see how they pull off the con, and still may get a thrill at the end to see what you thought, is not was is actual. The cast is brilliant, and they really look like they enjoy working with each other tremendously. And I must admit those lovely British accents are a real turn on! I really enjoy good comedy-drama, and I love surprise happy endings, Isn't your daily routine 'reality' enough? I hope there are more episodes to come!
