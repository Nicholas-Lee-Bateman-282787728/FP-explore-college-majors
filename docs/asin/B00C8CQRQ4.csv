1644564,A2VMT89TCSF105,B00C8CQRQ4,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[0, 0]","""Game of Thrones"" is a fantasy series aired on HBO, based on George R. R. Martin's fantasy novels ""A Song of Ice and Fire"". The plot is set in the fictitious lands of Westeros and Essos, where a power struggle for the Iron Throne rages between different noble houses after the murder of the old king. This DVD contains the episodes of the third season, and is notable for the episode ""The Rains of Castamere"", in which several of the main characters are brutally slain, disregarding every conventional idea about how TV should be made. But then, we've seen it before...in ""Lost"".I admit that I'm not an engaged super-fan of ""Game of Thrones"", but like most people, I nevertheless find myself watching every episode. Why? No idea, really. As I said in my review of Season Two, this is simply a remake of the European Early Middle Ages, with some Roman and ""Oriental"" spices thrown in. In contrast to most fantasy, Martin's story has very little supernatural flavour, and the whole plot feels just as meaningless as medieval history. We're talking blood feuds, civil wars, arranged marriages, orgies, strange new religions frequently even worse than the old ones... Europe around AD 600?Ironically, it could be the incredibly complex plot (or rather parallel plots) which makes the trick. That, and the colourful characters, makes it difficult not to find *something* of interest. A bit like a Swedish smorgasbord, I suppose? And yes, many viewers love the nudity or pretend to abhor the violence...Personally, I found the unapologetic, politically incorrect Orientalism of the Daenerys Targaryen subplot a real guilty pleasure. A blond, Nordic valkyrie liberating Black slaves and challenging effeminate and vile ""Semites""... I'm surprised nobody started a culture war over this?

While it is entertianing it's not living up to all the hype for me.The characters are not really following or breaking completely away from their stories in the books. Some characters are completely missing (Strong Belwas being the most notable in the third season). All of Dany's handmaidens are dead in the TV series. In the books they are her most loyal and trusted advisors. As such I'm a bit shocked and very sad that the seris is breaking so far away from the books. The third season is the worst about this so far.

I tried reading the novels off and on without much success, I wasn't too hooked after season one either... but season two really improved in my opinion.  A lot more intrigue and drama was evenly spaced and made for much better television.Season three is very interesting because there is a lot going on, but the story moves at a great pace between the main story lines.

Practically every episode feels like a season finale there is just so much insane stuff happening throughout and it barely ever lets up. While the first two seasons were great as well, I don't think they will prepare you for everything going on here and they will feel relatively tame by comparison. The creators have really upped the ante and not necessarily through more graphic sex and violence. The acting and dialogue are on a different level this season especially with Tywin Lannister, Charles Dance OWNS this season along with lots of great new characters with some familiar faces if you've seen films like There Will Be Blood, the remake of The Thing, The Dark Knight Rises, Pacific Rim, or Richard Ayoade's (The IT Crowd, The Watch) film Submarine. This season also gets better special effects with the growing dragons and a sword fight that looks like something from a Star Wars movie. You can't miss with this season, too good. Season four has a lot to live up to. As far as the books go I'm only halfway through A Clash of Kings, the second book, but it seems like there are elements still from that book in this season, Bran Stark's scenes in particular, so I don't think the seasons match up with the book number. Hopefully that means we'll get more TV seasons than there are books.

1644653,AG8K92N37MT27,B00C8CQRQ4,Garnet,"[1, 1]","I had been waiting (none too patiently) for this season to finally come out and I was not disappointed.  The problem is, if you only see the show on blu-ray and then gobble them up in just a few nights because you can't not just turn to the next episode, not only do you lose sleep, but you get so wrapped up in the world of Game of Thrones that its hard to come back down.  As ever, this show is full of sex and beauty, horror and honor, grace and violence.  The special effects are very good--especially love the dragons--and its so compelling that you can't not watch it, even the bits that have you wincing or wishing you had covered your eyes.This season is full of surprises, most of them not so good for our well-loved characters.  That's one thing about this show...you never know if someone will be there tomorrow or not.  And, all the while, we see the progress being made by Daenerys as she comes into her own, as much as her dragons, and continues on her quest to go back to Westeros and take back the Iron Throne.  She is so lovely and so inspiring and I hope hope hope that when she finally engages in the Game of Thrones with all of the rest of the would-be Kings and Queens that the show really pulls off what they are hinting at.Some spoilers below:As said above, one of my favorite story lines revolves around Daenerys.  I love it when she surprises her own supporters and keeps on growing in wisdom and strength.  Her resolve not to undermine what she believes in in the process of raising her army is precisely what will make her a great Queen, as well as her will to punish those who enslave others.  You go, girl!I am also shockingly fascinated by the growing relationship between Jaime and his female-knight-protector, and how much I have grown to not necessarily forgive Jaime for his past actions, but to understand where they come from.  Just as with Cersei and Tyrion...the author of their bad behavior firmly lies with their father.  But, on the other hand, their father is not a flat boring bad guy per se, as he is acting only out of what he sees as necessary to protect his family and his family's name.  The Lannisters are definitely a family you can love to hate.  Though, of course, out of all of them, I do adore their blacksheep, Tyrion, who has a heart of melting gold that he tries and fails to hide and protect.The storyline with Jon Snow continues to build as he is forced to consider what he truly believes in, and who he believes in.  I very much see him being a mover and shaker in future stories as the White Walkers and other creatures begin to trek southwards as Winter comes.  The climb up the Wall in this season was truly frightening.As for the Starks...OMG...well, 'nuff said.  Things have definitely been going from bad to worse to impossible for this poor family.  Though, I am enjoying the shamanistic aspect of the three-eyed raven dreams and the introduction of being able to look through the eyes of animals and control them...I am still left wondering how this will play into the next season.  What can one crippled boy and his friends do in the face of the White Walkers?  I suppose we will find out...As for the rest...conspiracy, darkness disguised as light and light as darkness, hardship, loss, grief, anger, religious fanaticism...this show stalks them all.  The only thing I felt went on for too long was the whole torture stuff with Theon (not one of my favorite characters)--blechy!  It just seemed too much a bit pointless, but who knows?  This show has pulled many rabbits out of many hats before.Once again--an absolute MASSIVE HIT of a show!

But a thirty hour marathon of watching this show now is really a bit much.... I advise a season a day with a nice break in between.  However, it's terribly addictive, and the onslaught continues in terms of sex, violence, power struggles and so on.  Hell, even the costumes rock.HBO never backs down from portraying borderline questionable themes and scenes with a gritty reality that will make you sit up and gasp at a few of the scenes.  It's got its hooks in me like crystal meth.... can't stop this thing we've started....Deviation from the books continues but is always done both with GRRM's awareness and involvement.  He's got a close relationship with the writers and they are keeping true to the TONE and FLAVOUR of the books even where they make changes to the action or timeline.  Ultimately the result still serves to bring you forward right where you're supposed to be.At this point I've stopped reading the books looking for explanations of things and I am taking the series at face value.  It's that good.  When I go back to the books again later they will dovetail with the show much more logically I am sure.There is a new packaging design for the third season, it still matches but it's got this translucent plastic slipcase instead of the cardboard one.  My OCD wishes it matched identically, but hey.... as long as it's not a big difference I'll be ok.Same 5 discs with 10 episodes as prior seasons.

I have Inside HBO's Game Of Thrones: Collector's Edition book, A Feast of Ice and Fire Cookbook, and even pre-ordered The World of Ice and Fire: The Official History of Westeros and The World of A Game of Thrones. I play the Game of Thrones board game almost every Saturday with my friends. I even have the comic book and have coasters and a Targaryen t-shirt. I also have the first two seasons on Blu-Ray (pre-ordered them here like 6 months in advance). I am a huge fan of the series.A Game of Thrones (book 1 in the Song of Ice and Fire book series) covered the first season. A Clash of Kings (book 2) was told in the second season. A Storm of Swords (book 3) however, is so meaty that D.B. Weiss and David Benioff want to cut out nothing of importance so it will span this season (season 3) and the next season (season 4). So for those who haven't watched this season yet, minor *spoilers* ahead. I won't give away anything too important and will keep these episode reviews mainly as a synopsis, and I won't complain about what's different from the book to screen adaptation, I promise.This show has it all, mystery, drama, action, sex and nudity, monsters, magic and political intrigue. It's shot all over the world (Northern Ireland, Malta, Croatia, and Iceland) and the sets and costume design are amazing. Music by Ramin Djawadi is brooding, heavy, sad and exciting. This show is adult in nature and content, but speaks to the kid in me who dreams of sword fighting, joining battles and fighting for freedom, battling monsters and seeing Dragons and exotic women. This show is easily one of the best shows ever created. It's up there with The Wire, Breaking Bad, Lost, Shameless, Deadwood, Doctor Who, The Walking Dead and Justified. Shows that are pure escapism and a bit fantasy that are grounded in reality of the Human condition and that people can relate to. Granted I don't think any of us can relate to seeing sword fights and White Walkers or Dragons flying around, yet we can all relate to losing loved ones, being betrayed, and standing up for what is right and just. This show is an epic masterpiece, a classic that is sure to be talked about for years to come.

There is nothing like GAME OF THRONES on TV or in the theaters. In fact, GAME OF THRONES surpassing just about any theatrical movie for quality and visual effects. A TV version of GAME OF THRONES allows for deeper character and story details. Sadly, there are only 10 episodes in the Season 3 but they are 10 seriously powerly episodes. GAME OF THRONES is addictive and can't be missed. It is set in a mythical land that looks and feels like medieval Europe. The costumes and settings are lavish. It feels not expense was spared in the filming of this remarkable show. It is an actor and Casting Director's dream with parts for actors of all ages, sizes and looks.I could spend pages extolling the virtues of the cast of Season 3 but I feel there are two amazing standouts. Maisie Williams plays young Arya Stark trying to avenge her father's murder and reunite with her family. Dressed as a boy she exudes anger and determination in her face. We feel her anger and pain and determination. This fine young actress has a bright future. Another remarkable actor is Alfie Allen as Theon Greyjoy. This season he is a prisoner being tortured by a mysterious person. Allen is so believable in his pain and misery. We see it in his eyes and actions. Here is another actor to watch.It is great to see lovely Diana Rigg as Olenna Tyrell. We rarely see this fine British actress and it's a joy to see her as the aging Tyrell Matriach in a role she obviously loves. Add in beloved character actor Charles Dance and the gorgeous Natalie Dormier and we have quite the cast and again, I could go on for pages just discussing the actors.There is a &#34;look&#34; to GAME OF THRONES that deserves praise for the production team. The lavish locales are awesome. We are taken from dark and forbodding locations to lush and lovely settings. It's hard to imagine all the work involved in filming this series.A word of caution. GAME OF THRONES is not for the squeamish. Season 3 brings us to new heights of gore and violence. This season maiming and loss of body parts are on the agenda. No one is safe and no one is spared as the innocent kill the innocent.

They really like the case and we do as well. It's very sturdy and stable and it set on the top of our Sanus entertainment center near our other special editions of other series.

1644682,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00C8CQRQ4,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[208, 260]","When it comes to premium cable, my worlds shift as the year goes on. For thirteen weeks in the fall, I get Showtime to watch HOMELAND and one of the best new shows on cable, MASTERS OF SEX. But for the rest of the year, I go back to HBO, and while there are many other good and compelling shows on that channel, such as THE NEWSROOM, and less so, TRUE BLOOD, the main reason I keep coming back is for GAME OF THRONES. And Season Three was perhaps the ultimate lesson as to why this show keeps you coming back. I've reviewed all of the seasons here, and while I found the first season a little problematic but really good overall, the second season was even better, and it just keeps improving into this season.It's hard to distill everything that happens in this season, and all the new characters and threats that are introduced, so I'll try to distill it in what I believe are the best moments. Daenerys Targaryen meeting The Unsullied, and her trek in defiance of a ""man's world"" is so vital, so strong and never gets stale. Bran meeting Jojen Reed to make sense of what he's becoming as a warg starts slow but builds extremely well. Jon Snow and Ygritte's relationship and Jon's ""undercover"" work with Mance Rayder's men is always compelling and suspenseful. The conflict that comes to a head between the Night's Watch and Craster. The initially antagonistic relationship between Jaime and Brienne comes into sharper focus as they warm up to each other. The plight of Davos and his friendship with Stannis conflicting with the intentions of Melisandre. The wedding of Tyrion and Sansa and the rift that creates with Shae. The interminable cruelty of Joffrey, and how he keeps getting figuratively spanked by Tywin. The Brotherhood Without Banners and the firey combat between The Hound and Beric. The women of the Tyrell family, particularly Olenna. The bear pit. The end of Astapor.And then, of course, The Red Wedding.I know that of everything that has happened in this season, the most talked-about event is the Red Wedding, and while there are many other important things happening, the episode ""The Rains of Castamere"" is a horrific, tragic and emotionally devastating event that, for people who are merely fans of the show and not of George R.R. Martin's epic novels like myself, seemed to come out of nowhere, but going back, you can see it coming with hindsight. It firmly establishes the brutally pragmatic machinations of Twyin and his exploitation of the personal slights felt by Roose Bolton and Walder Frey. Although, while the twists and turns of the Lannisters prove to have the most meat on them, the heart of the season stands firmly with Daenerys. She proves to be not only a brilliant strategist, but a leader that could rule with a merciful and generous heart. The soul of the show belongs to Jon Snow, a young man so clearly over his head in a situation that will force him to question his loyalties and his oath to the Night's Watch, making him the stand-in for the audience.As usual, everyone in the show is pretty amazing, but most surprising of all is the turn from Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister. It took a while for the audience to connect with him, particularly when his first significant deed of the show was to push Bran out of a window. But this season, more layers of the onion are peeled back to show that there is much more to him than what we've seen before, which makes me very happy since his was the character that I couldn't get with at all for quite some time. Emilia Clarke continues to amaze with her performance as the Mother of Dragons, and Charles Dance totally owns you (and everyone else around him) as Tywin Lannister. Wisely, the show decided to show much more of what was going on around the kingdoms, and not to devote too much focus to the conflict between the Starks and Lannisters.So bring on the White Walkers. Winter is coming and I'm ready.At least, I hope I'm ready.",5,"An Amazing Show, but Beware The Rains of Castamere.",1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,3938,"['When', 'premium', 'cable', 'worlds', 'shift', 'year', 'thirteen', 'weeks', 'fall', 'get', 'Showtime', 'watch', 'HOMELAND', 'one', 'best', 'new', 'shows', 'cable', 'MASTERS', 'OF', 'SEX', 'rest', 'year', 'go', 'back', 'HBO', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'good', 'compelling', 'shows', 'channel', 'such', 'THE', 'NEWSROOM', 'less', 'so', 'TRUE', 'BLOOD', 'main', 'reason', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'GAME', 'OF', 'THRONES', 'Season', 'Three', 'was', 'perhaps', 'ultimate', 'lesson', 'why', 'show', 'coming', 'back', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'seasons', 'here', 'found', 'first', 'season', 'little', 'problematic', 'really', 'good', 'overall', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'just', 'improving', 'season.It', 'hard', 'distill', 'everything', 'season', 'new', 'characters', 'threats', 'are', 'introduced', ""'ll"", 'try', 'distill', 'what', 'believe', 'are', 'best', 'moments', 'Daenerys', 'Targaryen', 'meeting', 'Unsullied', 'trek', 'defiance', 'man', 'world', 'so', 'vital', 'so', 'strong', 'never', 'stale', 'Bran', 'meeting', 'Jojen', 'Reed', 'make', 'sense', 'what', 'becoming', 'warg', 'slow', 'extremely', 'well', 'Jon', 'Snow', 'Ygritte', 'relationship', 'Jon', 'undercover', 'work', 'Mance', 'Rayder', 'men', 'always', 'compelling', 'suspenseful', 'conflict', 'head', 'Night', 'Watch', 'Craster', 'initially', 'antagonistic', 'relationship', 'Jaime', 'Brienne', 'sharper', 'focus', 'warm', 'up', 'other', 'plight', 'Davos', 'friendship', 'Stannis', 'conflicting', 'intentions', 'Melisandre', 'wedding', 'Tyrion', 'Sansa', 'rift', 'Shae', 'interminable', 'cruelty', 'Joffrey', 'how', 'getting', 'figuratively', 'spanked', 'Tywin', 'Brotherhood', 'Without', 'Banners', 'firey', 'combat', 'Hound', 'Beric', 'women', 'Tyrell', 'family', 'particularly', 'Olenna', 'bear', 'pit', 'end', 'Astapor.And', 'then', 'course', 'Red', 'Wedding.I', 'know', 'everything', 'happened', 'season', 'most', 'talked-about', 'event', 'Red', 'Wedding', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'important', 'things', 'happening', 'episode', 'Rains', 'Castamere', 'horrific', 'tragic', 'emotionally', 'devastating', 'event', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'merely', 'fans', 'show', 'not', 'George', 'R.R', 'Martin', 'epic', 'novels', 'seemed', 'come', 'nowhere', 'going', 'back', 'can', 'see', 'coming', 'hindsight', 'firmly', 'brutally', 'pragmatic', 'machinations', 'Twyin', 'exploitation', 'personal', 'slights', 'felt', 'Roose', 'Bolton', 'Walder', 'Frey', 'twists', 'turns', 'Lannisters', 'prove', 'have', 'most', 'meat', 'heart', 'season', 'firmly', 'Daenerys', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'brilliant', 'strategist', 'leader', 'could', 'rule', 'merciful', 'generous', 'heart', 'soul', 'show', 'Jon', 'Snow', 'young', 'man', 'so', 'clearly', 'head', 'situation', 'will', 'force', 'question', 'loyalties', 'oath', 'Night', 'Watch', 'making', 'stand-in', 'audience.As', 'usual', 'everyone', 'show', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'most', 'surprising', 'turn', 'Nikolaj', 'Coster-Waldau', 'Jaime', 'Lannister', 'took', 'while', 'audience', 'connect', 'particularly', 'when', 'first', 'significant', 'deed', 'show', 'was', 'push', 'Bran', 'window', 'season', 'more', 'layers', 'onion', 'are', 'peeled', 'back', 'show', 'much', 'more', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'happy', 'was', 'character', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'quite', 'time', 'Emilia', 'Clarke', 'amaze', 'performance', 'Mother', 'Dragons', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'totally', 'everyone', 'else', 'Tywin', 'Lannister', 'Wisely', 'show', 'decided', 'show', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'kingdoms', 'not', 'devote', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'conflict', 'Starks', 'Lannisters.So', 'bring', 'White', 'Walkers', 'Winter', 'coming', ""'m"", 'ready.At', 'least', 'hope', ""'m"", 'ready']",Game of Thrones: Season 3

In literature, I can, to a degree, depending on the author's descriptions, understand the politics of the literarily-designed world (Dekker/Lee's Books of Mortals series, for one, was confusing at first, but made sense in the end of book one, so does the politics of Robert Mullin's Well of the Worlds series). So it's almost second nature to understand the extreme politics of Westerros. It all seems crazy and hard to fathom in the first season, but it's a twist on medieval styles. By the time of the end of this season, things get cleared up to a necessary degree.As one can imagine from HBO, there are numerous heavily-shocking moments (it almost made me not want to get married after all) that relate either to a specific political rule, cultural rule, or to a character's specific attribute (such as a man who incestually marries his own daughters to father more daughters). And yes, a number of beloved characters had my jaw dropping when they were brutally killed off. Oh, and torture sequences, bizarre black magic rituals, crazy sword and firefights, and disturbing crows.I haven't read the books yet, so according to Wikipedia, this season is loosely based on the first half of Martin's &#34;A Feast for Crows&#34;, which makes sense considering the crows shown and the references to certain people getting called &#34;crows&#34; and being sought out to be killed.

In my case, they did play, but took a long time to load, and often rebooted if I only played the first episode on the disc, then tried to play the second episode later. I suspect this has to do with some rather ill-advised attempts at copy protection, thus punishing the legitimate buyers while doing virtually nothing to stem piracy.

Personally I am less interested in what happens north of the wall and that element put me off reading beyond the first book. Fortunately, the bulk of the stories here are concerned with the more gritty dealings between the contenders for the throne. Being unfamiliar with the books, means that virtually everything in the TV series is new to me &#8211; confrontingly so at times. It continues to be a superbly produced show. Things look as they should, whether it&#8217;s a grand castle vista or a brutal killing. The violence is very strong but that is the key to this show.

I've read the books (book 3, on which this season was based, was absolutely superb, one of the best books I've ever read actually) but I think this would be very good indeed even if you had not read the books?The dvd extras are very good - I particularly enjoyed the commentary of Richard Madden (Robb) & Michelle Fairly (Catelyn)'s on the Rains episode. Nice to have a few extended/deleted scenes, particularly one with Jon meeting Mance Rayder; another with Tywin meeting up with Pycelle isn't much cop, can see why they left that out; Tywin is best sparring with his sonThe 15 minute video synopsis of the previous season is very VERY useful as there really is so much going on. A close watcher of the show might not remember that Bran & Rickon are presumed dead, that Littlefinger misled Catelyn into thinking BOTH her daughters were still held at Kings LandingActually, it might be a good idea, if you have NOT read the books to watch the previous seasons, to get you up to speed.Nice touches: Ned being mentioned in the penultimate episode of the season. Its easy to forget how important his character was to the show, and how all the chaos unfolding is out of his unfair treatment by Joffrey back in season 1Minor characters (like Roose Bolton, introduced in season 2) become crucial to the plot, and the attention to detail is crucial, especially if you've read the books. And that's another thing - the show is clearly done by fans of the book. There are no major changes to the book. Robb's wife gets a name change, and Arya meets with Tywin back in season 2 (as did NOT happen in the books) but theres nothing major. The author (Martin) writes for the show for an episode a season, and its clear that the show is following the book very closely. (Martin has a commentary on his Bear & the Maiden Fair also)The casting: spot on. Mance is as you remember him from the book. Hey! I LIKE the guyIn my opinion, the book helps if you watch the show, filling everything out (as it were) so you might want to pick them up at some pointBut the show is a can't miss, really. Season 3 is absolutely superb, winter is coming. Not near enough of the White Walkers as you could wish, but the threat is there. Can't wait to see season 4 and Tyrion getting a bit of his own back against his father!(Season 4 will be based on book 3 also. Its a massive book but well worth the read.

I think half the stuff in the TV series is made up, using the same characters but creating dialogue and scenes that were not in the books.  That said, they do a pretty good job of lengthening the whole series through these creative additions.  I really like the dwarf (Tyrion) in this series (especially now with his scar on the cheek).  Jeffrey, the King, is still a total jerk, and many of the scenes that create out of nothing do a good job of making you dislike the boy king even more.

1644723,A1H5KNQ61FFCX2,B00C8CQRQ4,"khuddle ""khuddle""","[1, 1]","Just like the third book was by far and away the best in the written series, the 3rd seasonof the HBO series is absolutely exceptional. First two seasons I found myself intrigued by some of the storylines, but bored by some of the others. Not the case in the third season, at all. I found myself caring about every second of the show, from the titanic battle between the Starks and Lannisters, to John Snow's daring adventures amongst the Wildlings. I really can't think of one weak performance among any of the characters -- even some of the younger actors like the young man who played Joffrey just hit everything out of the park. Some of the actors are so good they actually improve upon their characters as they were written in the books -- the actor who plays Stannis Baratheon, for example, is just incredible and steals just about every scene he is in; or the actress who plays Ygritte, a very minor character in the books, but here you find you really care about the fate of this character (and her relationship with John Snow); or the actor who plays the impossibly evil Ramsay Snow, totally different from how I pictured him after reading the books (ie. he's small and kind of puny, almost looks like Elijah Wood's evil twin), and yet he is truly terrifying and utterly convincing as a pure and unapologetic sociopath. In short, this is by far and away the best installment in the TV series so far. Will they be able to continue the momentum into season four? If its only half as good as season three it will be absolutely worth watching.All kinds of pressure now for Martin to finish off books six and seven and really give this outstanding television crew something to work with.",5,3rd Season Is Sublime,1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,1691,"['Just', 'third', 'book', 'was', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'written', 'series', '3rd', 'seasonof', 'HBO', 'series', 'absolutely', 'exceptional', 'First', 'two', 'seasons', 'found', 'intrigued', 'storylines', 'bored', 'others', 'Not', 'case', 'third', 'season', 'found', 'caring', 'second', 'show', 'titanic', 'battle', 'Starks', 'Lannisters', 'John', 'Snow', 'daring', 'Wildlings', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'weak', 'performance', 'characters', 'even', 'younger', 'actors', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'Joffrey', 'just', 'hit', 'everything', 'park', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'actually', 'improve', 'characters', 'were', 'written', 'books', 'actor', 'who', 'Stannis', 'Baratheon', 'example', 'just', 'incredible', 'steals', 'just', 'scene', 'actress', 'who', 'Ygritte', 'very', 'minor', 'character', 'books', 'here', 'find', 'really', 'care', 'fate', 'character', 'relationship', 'John', 'Snow', 'actor', 'who', 'impossibly', 'evil', 'Ramsay', 'Snow', 'totally', 'different', 'how', 'pictured', 'reading', 'books', 'ie', 'small', 'kind', 'puny', 'almost', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'evil', 'twin', 'yet', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'pure', 'unapologetic', 'sociopath', 'short', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'installment', 'TV', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'continue', 'momentum', 'season', 'four', 'only', 'half', 'as', 'good', 'season', 'three', 'will', 'be', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'watching.All', 'kinds', 'pressure', 'now', 'Martin', 'finish', 'off', 'books', 'six', 'seven', 'really', 'give', 'outstanding', 'television', 'crew', 'something', 'work']",Game of Thrones: Season 3

1644729,AFOHUSVNZZ49W,B00C8CQRQ4,K. Reynolds,"[1, 1]","HBO SHOULD develop a new theme &#8211; something along the lines of &#8220;Nobody does it better.&#8221; Because no other network excels at producing epic stories or high-definition releases like this cable network. We previewed its potential with series like &#8220;Rome&#8221; and &#8220;Deadwood,&#8221; but &#8220;Game of Thrones&#8221; consistently sets standards others don&#8217;t come close to.Episode One opens with Davos Seaworth (Liam Cunningham), a survivor of Season Two&#8217;s Battle of King&#8217;s Landing, stranded on a barren rock. Blistered and ragged, we can know he&#8217;s been there some time. As he waves for help from a distant ship, nothing could look more realistic &#8211; unless it was possible to step into the scene ourselves like the legendary Holodeck of &#8220;Star Trek: The Next Generation.&#8221;That scene &#8211; and all the rest of the dynamic third season &#8211; look and sound so authentic on this 1080p and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround track, the only thing better is being there ...Except Westeros isn't the healthiest world to visit. Even those who have never seen the series or read author/executive producer George R.R. Martin&#8217;s &#8220;A Song of Fire and Ice,&#8221; know about the Red Wedding. It&#8217;s a scene from episode 9, &#8220;The Rains of Castamere,&#8221; and has become a classic TV moment. (I was one of the readers wondering if the Red Wedding and its aftermath would make it to film. It actually surpassed my expectations.)The general plot isn't as complicated as you&#8217;d think. Everything revolves around a bitter civil war over who will sit on the Iron Throne and rule the previously united Seven Kingdoms. This fantasy medieval world has known a long period of prosperity, but corruption and a sadistic young king have the realm engaging in full-out carnage, betrayal, espionage, torture and assassination. &#8220;Game of Thrones&#8217;&#8221; appeal comes in the fully realized characters and their actions; we need to know what will happen next.All this is thanks to series&#8217; co-creators, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, who fell in love with Martin&#8217;s books. Their attention to detail, staying true to the source material, writing, directing and casting has turned the show into a masterwork. Although it never would've happened without a network willing to take a millions-of-dollars risk to put it on air. There&#8217;s now talk of making a film for theatrical release.Major kudos also go to HBO for the terrific batch of bonus features provided on the Blu-ray/DVD/Digital package. There are hours of extras loaded on the five Blu-ray discs. Every episode has an in-episode guide, allowing viewers to access background characters, location and historical info. All episodes, except the first, have a commentary and, in some cases, two. Speakers include actors, writers and directors. Some rely on fun, such &#8220;Kissed by Fire,&#8221; with Nikolaj Coster Waldau (Jaime Lannister), Gwendoline Christie (Brienne of Tarth) and writer Bryan Cogman. Others are more serious and informative, such as &#8220;The Bear and the Maiden Fair&#8221; with Martin and director Michelle MacLaren.My favorite was &#8220;The Rains of Castamere&#8221; with Richard Madden (Robb Stark), Michelle Fairley (Catelyn Stark) and director David Nutter. Nutter talks about a website with more than 9-million hits on the episode. Fairley had never seen it before, saying she was &#8220;too scared to watch it.&#8221; Both Fairley and Madden are weeping by the end.Other bonus features include a more detailed look at &#8220;Rains,&#8221; and short featurettes: &#8220;A Gathering Storm,&#8221; recapping Season 2; &#8220;New Characters&#8221;; &#8220;The Politics of Marriage,&#8221; and &#8220;Inside the Wildings,&#8221; a closer look at the Northerners being chased south by the White Walkers &#8211; another mainland conflict-to-be, I reckon. Also find a handful of outstanding deleted and extended scenes, the best featuring Tywin Lannister (Charles Dance).I missed the &#8220;Round Table&#8221; discussions with Benioff, Weiss, and the actors as found on the Season 1 and 2 presentations, but it&#8217;s easy to see how they were kind of busy. (Exhausted and injured, too. Kit Harrington (Jon Snow) broke his ankle; many of his &#8220;running&#8221; scenes were played by a body double; some were rewritten so he could sit.)Maybe they&#8217;ll be able to catch their breath for by the time Season 4 comes out on disc - but I doubt it.  &#8212;

1644737,A3NYZB4V55CZIM,B00C8CQRQ4,Liz,"[1, 2]","Game of Thrones is an exceptionally popular and critically-acclaimed show. If you're considering purchasing season 3 I have to assume you know about the show so I'm not going to go into those details. I'm primarily going to focus on the Bluray release itself.The third season of Game of Thrones is packaged almost identically to the previous bluray releases. Five bluray discs are interspersed throughout folding case that fits within a hard slipcase. A plastic slipcover goes over these to create the dragon shadow effect. A smaller slip case that fits within the hard slipcover holds the double-sided DVD versions of the show as well as the digital copy code. In terms of packaging it is frankly exquisite. The only comments I want to make with regards to this are:1. I consider having the DVDs included as kind of a bonus, but the double sided nature of the discs as well as the slip case you store them in creates a perfect storm to scratch or damage the DVDs. Handle them with care.2. The DVD release is 5 discs, the bluray release is also 5 discs. With bluray discs able to hold so much more information I'm kind of at a loss as to why so many discs are needed.

Peter Jackson richly deserved the academy awards for best director and best picture that he won for The Return of the King.  Since Tolkein, only Robert Jordan and George R.R. Martin approached his creative genius.  However they could not complete their stories and just got caught up in logorrhea.  Jordan was silenced by death and Martin by a paralyzing case of writer's block  However the early books of both writers were amazing and showed great promise. Too bad the Wheel of Time and the Song or Fire and Ice sagas will never be completed by the original geniuses who created them.

The presentation is nice, and the two sets of discs are in separate folders within the box itself.

1644770,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B00C8CQRQ4,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","It is almost impossible to write a review that does not give too much away, but I will be as general as possible with the description so as not to give away major spoilers.The series of course is based on the series of books by George R.R. Martin.  If you have not read the books or seen the prior two seasons you cannot really jump into season three because there is just too much going on to pick it up in the middle. There are a lot of characters and story lines that jump back and forth, so you really do have to pay attention to figure out who is who and what side everyone is on.  Each season is essentially a mini-series that follows the events of one book. It is spread out throughout 10 episodes and the story keeps building upon itself.If you are new to the series or looking at this because you have heard of it and are wondering what it is all about, you need to know that the show is very violent and has a lot of sexual content.  So if that is the kind of thing you do not want to watch then this is not the show for you.  It is set in a medieval fantasy world and involves a war to rule a kingdom.  While there are some truly evil characters, most have some shades of gray to them so they are not really all good or all bad.  And this is definitely a story where no character, no matter how central to the story is safe.This season sees Daenerys Targaryen amassing an army to try to take back the throne, and on the surface it looks like she is the best equipped to do so.  Tywin Lannister; fresh off saving the day at the end of last season begins to show how much power he really has and while this means Tyrion, the only &#34;good&#34; member of the family is brought to heel somewhat, you do get see Joffrey put in his place to some extent.  The threat of the White Walkers continues, but we only continue to see them sporadically at this point just as has been the case in the first two seasons.  The Wildlings who Jon Snow encountered at the end of last season also have a much larger role in the third season.  In all there are about 5 ongoing story lines including those of Arya, Bran and Jamie Lannister.  I think they did a good job given all the stories as close to equal time as possible, even though some episodes gave more weight to one or two from time to time.The high point of the season, not only in terms of the shocking nature of it but what it does to set the stage going forward is the &#34;red wedding.&#34;  It is so pivotal to the series that there is about an hour long bonus feature devoted solely to that episode that contrasts it with how it played out in the book, and really broke down how they made it work for the show.  As for the other bonus materials for those who do get the discs, there is about 2 hrs of bonus features from making of and behind the scenes features, as well as deleted scenes and an interactive history of all the various regions in the Game Of Thrones world.  Definitely a lot of material for those who like to go through the bonus features.  Of course the show looks and sounds great on blu ray, and you will get the show on DVD as well.Most likely you will have some idea if you are looking at this page about what the show is.  If you are a diehard fan and have seen the other seasons, this offers much of the same.  If you are curious as to what it is about, subject to the provisos I stated above about the nature of the series, if you are a fan of the fantasy genre, it is definitely worth checking out.",5,Continues to be great,1393891200,"03 4, 2014",2014,3480,"['almost', 'impossible', 'write', 'review', 'not', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'general', 'possible', 'description', 'so', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'major', 'spoilers.The', 'series', 'course', 'based', 'series', 'books', 'George', 'R.R', 'Martin', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'seen', 'prior', 'two', 'seasons', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'jump', 'season', 'three', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'pick', 'up', 'middle', 'are', 'lot', 'characters', 'story', 'lines', 'jump', 'back', 'forth', 'really', 'do', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'who', 'what', 'side', 'everyone', 'season', 'essentially', 'mini-series', 'events', 'one', 'book', 'spread', '10', 'episodes', 'story', 'building', 'itself.If', 'are', 'new', 'series', 'looking', 'have', 'heard', 'are', 'wondering', 'what', 'need', 'know', 'show', 'very', 'violent', 'lot', 'sexual', 'content', 'So', 'kind', 'thing', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'watch', 'then', 'not', 'show', 'set', 'medieval', 'fantasy', 'world', 'war', 'rule', 'kingdom', 'are', 'truly', 'evil', 'characters', 'most', 'have', 'shades', 'gray', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'all', 'good', 'bad', 'definitely', 'story', 'where', 'character', 'matter', 'how', 'central', 'story', 'safe.This', 'season', 'sees', 'Daenerys', 'Targaryen', 'amassing', 'army', 'try', 'take', 'back', 'throne', 'surface', 'best', 'equipped', 'do', 'so', 'Tywin', 'Lannister', 'fresh', 'saving', 'day', 'end', 'last', 'season', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'power', 'really', 'Tyrion', 'only', '34', 'good', '34', 'member', 'family', 'brought', 'heel', 'somewhat', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'Joffrey', 'put', 'place', 'extent', 'threat', 'White', 'Walkers', 'only', 'continue', 'see', 'sporadically', 'point', 'just', 'been', 'case', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Wildlings', 'who', 'Jon', 'Snow', 'encountered', 'end', 'last', 'season', 'also', 'have', 'much', 'larger', 'role', 'third', 'season', 'are', '5', 'ongoing', 'story', 'lines', 'including', 'Arya', 'Bran', 'Jamie', 'Lannister', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'given', 'stories', 'close', 'equal', 'time', 'possible', 'even', 'episodes', 'gave', 'more', 'weight', 'one', 'two', 'time', 'time.The', 'high', 'point', 'season', 'not', 'only', 'terms', 'shocking', 'nature', 'what', 'set', 'stage', 'going', 'forward', '34', 'red', 'wedding.', '34', 'so', 'pivotal', 'series', 'hour', 'long', 'bonus', 'feature', 'devoted', 'solely', 'episode', 'how', 'played', 'out', 'book', 'really', 'broke', 'down', 'how', 'made', 'work', 'show', 'other', 'bonus', 'materials', 'who', 'do', 'get', 'discs', '2', 'hrs', 'bonus', 'features', 'making', 'scenes', 'features', 'as', 'well', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'interactive', 'history', 'various', 'regions', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'world', 'Definitely', 'lot', 'material', 'who', 'like', 'go', 'bonus', 'course', 'show', 'great', 'blu', 'ray', 'will', 'get', 'show', 'DVD', 'well.Most', 'likely', 'will', 'have', 'idea', 'are', 'looking', 'page', 'what', 'show', 'are', 'diehard', 'fan', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'seasons', 'much', 'same', 'are', 'curious', 'what', 'subject', 'provisos', 'stated', 'nature', 'series', 'are', 'fan', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",Game of Thrones: Season 3

Problems are started to get bigger now...and at the end of Season 3, you get the feeling that something grand will be upon Westeros in a ridiculous way.If you aren't on board yet, you need to give this a try, but you MUST start from Season 1.  Reading the books is not necessary, but if you have trouble keeping track of characters, you might want to do that first.I am a big fan of sci-fi like Star trek Next Generation; Battlestar Gallactica; Firefly; and Vikings (you could argue VIkings isn't sci-fi, but it's close to medieval sci-fi)  Anyone who enjoys those items should definitely give this a try.My ONLY complaint with this season, is that it ended without any cliffhangers.  You pretty much know exactly how Season 4 is going to start.  The 2nd to last episode really felt like a typical series finale, but I digress.  I'm not against how it ended, I just find it a bit different is all.But without getting into spoilers...let's talk about what you get.-Packaging- The bluray copies come in a map style folding format with striking photos of the main characters.  I'm not a huge fan of folding maps, as I never know how to do that...but luckily this is much less complicated.  The DVD copies come in a small and relatively plain sleeve...that is nudged inside the main cover.  I'm just glad that the DVD copies exist...it's a nice option for someone who wants to watch them at a friends house..but you know they don't have a bluray player.  Or perhaps your 2nd TV or whatever doesn't have one.-Audio/Visual quality:  I can't compare this to the HBO streamed version, because I don't have HBO.  I played this on my ps4 and full 5.1 surround sound.  The audio is, as expected, fantastic.  Whether it's the sweeping music, fantastic actors/actresses, the sounds really bring you into the environment.  This series takes you far north of the wall, all over Westeros, and of course east to Qarth.  Each environment is unique and given much care.-Extra features: Tons.

What has been great about the show from the start remains great, and some characters who've stumbled before get fantastic moments and development in this season.However some cracks are showing in the armor of this show, and most of them are romantic. While love has played into aspects of the show before it's never been sappy. At least not before this season. There are multiple romantic pairings, and while some work better than others none of them really bring anything new or interesting to the table.

Everything you could possibly want is here, from deleted scenes to commentaries, documentaries and more.I have to take off a star because this season was far less focused than season 2.  The burden of dealing with so many characters seems to have finally become a problem.  I found myself asking, ""Is this storyline ever going to go somewhere?""  And this was accented by the ""big moment"" in the season that wasn't so much surprising as it was predictable.The reason that Ned Stark's death worked so well for me in season 1, is because I thought, ""Oh, he's gonna get out of it!"" right up until the moment he didn't.  That was awesome.  So when I sat back and realized where this season's storyline was headed (I didn't put everything together until the episode before it happened), I already knew what to expect.  It also had me asking *why* we had spent so much time on their storyline if they were going to end up dead.I love a great tragedy.  One of my all-time favorites is Shakespeare's ""King Lear,"" so I do have a place in my heart for that devastation when everything goes horribly wrong for a character.  But in this case, it felt like wasted time with characters.  Every time that storyline hit the screen, I groaned, because it felt so unfocused.  Now I know why.That said, there are some stand-out moments to this season.  Danerys finally has something interesting going on (and dragons!), the Knight's Watch goes all Lord of the Flies, and we have a lot of ""set pieces,"" like someone fighting a bear, which was fun.  There's also a scene between Catelyn and Talissa that was one of the most beautiful and poignant moments this show has to offer, with an incredible piece of music playing behind it (inexplicably missing from the soundtrack).  I am certainly continuing to watch this show as it broadcasts on HBO (at this time of writing I have watched through the sixth episode of season four), but it still seems to suffer from the, ""Is this going anywhere?"" problem with a few storylines.That said, if it all comes together in a surprising and delightful way, it will all have been worth it.",4,Amazing Blu-Ray,1400371200,"05 18, 2014",2014,2216,"['set', 'excellence', 'season', '2', 'Blu-Ray', 'terms', 'picture/audio', 'quality', 'bonus', 'features', 'Everything', 'could', 'possibly', 'want', 'here', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentaries', 'documentaries', 'more.I', 'have', 'take', 'off', 'star', 'season', 'was', 'far', 'less', 'focused', 'season', '2', 'burden', 'dealing', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'have', 'finally', 'become', 'problem', 'found', 'asking', 'storyline', 'ever', 'going', 'go', 'somewhere', 'was', 'accented', 'big', 'moment', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'surprising', 'was', 'predictable.The', 'reason', 'Ned', 'Stark', 'death', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'season', '1', 'thought', 'Oh', 'gon', 'get', 'right', 'up', 'moment', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'awesome', 'when', 'sat', 'back', 'realized', 'where', 'season', 'storyline', 'was', 'headed', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'everything', 'together', 'episode', 'happened', 'already', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'also', 'had', 'asking', 'had', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'storyline', 'were', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'dead.I', 'great', 'tragedy', 'One', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'Shakespeare', 'King', 'Lear', 'do', 'have', 'place', 'heart', 'devastation', 'when', 'everything', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'character', 'case', 'felt', 'wasted', 'time', 'characters', 'time', 'storyline', 'hit', 'screen', 'groaned', 'felt', 'so', 'unfocused', 'Now', 'know', 'said', 'are', 'stand-out', 'moments', 'season', 'Danerys', 'finally', 'something', 'interesting', 'going', 'dragons', 'Knight', 'Watch', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'have', 'lot', 'set', 'pieces', 'someone', 'fighting', 'bear', 'was', 'fun', 'also', 'scene', 'Catelyn', 'Talissa', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'poignant', 'moments', 'show', 'offer', 'incredible', 'piece', 'music', 'playing', 'inexplicably', 'missing', 'soundtrack', 'am', 'certainly', 'continuing', 'watch', 'show', 'HBO', 'time', 'writing', 'have', 'watched', 'sixth', 'episode', 'season', 'four', 'still', 'suffer', 'going', 'anywhere', 'problem', 'few', 'storylines.That', 'said', 'together', 'surprising', 'delightful', 'way', 'will', 'have', 'been', 'worth']",Game of Thrones: Season 3

I was turned on to this show by a friend and in turn I've turned about 10 people on to this show and I hope many more after this and other reviews, and trust me this is the one time you want to walk into a show blind because it will be surprise after surprise and the best past of this show is they kill off lead characters and this is what makes this show so great because this is how it happens in the real world and at the end of the day if more shows did this not just when someone wants off the show they would find that YES the viewers will be upset for awhile but in the end it makes it a better show. At the end of the day this is by far one of the best DRAMAS EVER!!!HBO you did this. The show has only one flaw and thats that stupid 10 episodes per season thing that the network is now doing, in the 90's they gave you about 18-20 shows per season then in the early 2000's that dropped to 14-16 then it went to 12 and now it's down to 10...stop being so greedy HBO!!!

1644839,AYP5082JDMAHL,B00C8CQRQ4,Ryjacork,"[81, 164]","I'm sure many fans of the TV series are tired of hearing the elitist opinions of those who have read the books. I'm fully aware of the type of person who falls in love with a book, or graphic novel, or video game, or whatever, and finds any adaptation that deviates in any way from the source material to be complete and utter crap. I want to begin this review by saying that I am not this type of person. The first two seasons of Game of Thrones I found to be utterly brilliant. Even the filler, or the areas in which the show deviated from the books was marvelous. The acting was superb, even the child actors for this show are in rare form compared to what you see in shows such as The Walking Dead. The first season blew everybody away, both long time fans of the book series, and those new to the world of Westeros. The second season cashed the check that the first season wrote, building upon the epic promise of the first season finale. Then came season three...Before I get into the specific failings of the third season, I'm going to state for everybody the underlying cause of 90% of this season's problems. Greed. The studios trying to gouge more money out of the fans (and they have the balls to charge 40% more for the DVD/BR?!). The third book in the Song of Ice and Fire series, A Storm of Swords, has a lot happening in it. So using this excuse, the studio decided to divide the book into two seasons in order to show all the content. Since one thousand pages obviously does not fill 20 hours of television, they gave us lots of filler in order to fill time, like Margery and Sansa talking about boys. Furthermore, the actual content from the book moved at a snail's pace. Jon Snow took an entire episode just to climb the wall.Now I would be able to forgive this, if it weren't for the fact that they actually cut out some of the important characters and things from the book. All the jokes about Podd's bedroom performance could maybe have been cut to actually give real screen time to Mance Rayder or Tormund? One of the most important plot points in the book is Jon's conflict between his oath to the Night's Watch and his sympathy for the Wildling cause. The show makes Mance Rayder seem like the typical generic tribal warlord, and Tormund is just some giant ginger whose name is only mentioned once. I want to see Mance playing the flute, and Tormund telling outrageous stories about his member. The only wildling that is portrayed as even remotely sympathetic is Ygritte. And even that seems less so after she shoots Jon half a dozen times with arrows. Not to mention we get to see barely anything of Barristan Selmy. And who is Strong Belwas again?One of my biggest complaints here is also they they butchered (no pun intended) the Red Wedding. The most infamous scene in the entire series, and they messed it up. First of all, it would have been cinematic gold had they actually played the Reins of Castemere during the massacre, rather than playing the entire song, and then beginning the killings. Putting the right music to the right scene is something that you can only get in film or television, and it would have been something even the books couldn't show. Huge opportunity missed there. I also felt as though the gore and blood were unnecessarily cartoonish at some points. The throat slashing effects were straight out of Sweeney Todd, and the stomach stabbing scene felt unrealistic and awkward. Finally the scene were Robb actually gets stabbed. It would have been more dramatic to show Roose approaching him while he was on his knees, as it did in the books, then to just have him pop on screen and then off again like the 1990s animated Batman.Now this isn't to say that the season didn't have its high points. The scene where Danaerys liberates Slaver's Bay and gains her unsullied army was one of the best in the entire show. In fact most of the Essos scenes were well done. Although I wouldn't mind seeing a bit more of Barristan Selmy. Also the scene where Jamie saves Brienne from the bear was fantastic. Ultimately though, the glowing parts of this season were bogged down by too much crap. The worst part is that they've painted themselves into a corner where season 4 is concerned, once again working only with half a book. Hopefully they will find a way to better manage their content.",3,"Great Show, Meh Season.",1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,4333,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'fans', 'TV', 'series', 'are', 'tired', 'hearing', 'elitist', 'opinions', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'books', ""'m"", 'fully', 'aware', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'love', 'book', 'graphic', 'novel', 'video', 'game', 'whatever', 'adaptation', 'way', 'source', 'material', 'be', 'complete', 'utter', 'crap', 'want', 'begin', 'review', 'saying', 'am', 'not', 'type', 'person', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'found', 'be', 'utterly', 'brilliant', 'Even', 'filler', 'areas', 'show', 'deviated', 'books', 'was', 'marvelous', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'even', 'child', 'actors', 'show', 'are', 'rare', 'form', 'compared', 'what', 'see', 'shows', 'such', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'first', 'season', 'blew', 'everybody', 'away', 'long', 'time', 'fans', 'book', 'series', 'new', 'world', 'Westeros', 'second', 'season', 'cashed', 'check', 'first', 'season', 'wrote', 'building', 'epic', 'promise', 'first', 'season', 'finale', 'Then', 'came', 'season', 'three', 'get', 'specific', 'failings', 'third', 'season', ""'m"", 'going', 'state', 'everybody', 'underlying', 'cause', '90', '%', 'season', 'problems', 'Greed', 'studios', 'trying', 'gouge', 'more', 'money', 'fans', 'have', 'balls', 'charge', '40', '%', 'more', 'DVD/BR', 'third', 'book', 'Song', 'Ice', 'Fire', 'series', 'A', 'Storm', 'Swords', 'lot', 'happening', 'So', 'using', 'excuse', 'studio', 'decided', 'divide', 'book', 'two', 'seasons', 'order', 'show', 'content', 'one', 'thousand', 'pages', 'obviously', 'not', 'fill', '20', 'hours', 'television', 'gave', 'lots', 'filler', 'order', 'fill', 'time', 'Margery', 'Sansa', 'talking', 'boys', 'Furthermore', 'actual', 'content', 'book', 'moved', 'snail', 'pace', 'Jon', 'Snow', 'took', 'entire', 'episode', 'just', 'climb', 'wall.Now', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'forgive', 'were', ""n't"", 'fact', 'actually', 'cut', 'out', 'important', 'characters', 'things', 'book', 'jokes', 'Podd', 'bedroom', 'performance', 'could', 'maybe', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'actually', 'give', 'real', 'screen', 'time', 'Mance', 'Rayder', 'Tormund', 'One', 'most', 'important', 'plot', 'points', 'book', 'Jon', 'conflict', 'oath', 'Night', 'Watch', 'sympathy', 'Wildling', 'cause', 'show', 'Mance', 'Rayder', 'seem', 'typical', 'generic', 'tribal', 'warlord', 'Tormund', 'just', 'giant', 'ginger', 'name', 'only', 'mentioned', 'once', 'want', 'see', 'Mance', 'playing', 'flute', 'Tormund', 'telling', 'outrageous', 'stories', 'member', 'only', 'wildling', 'portrayed', 'even', 'remotely', 'sympathetic', 'Ygritte', 'even', 'less', 'so', 'shoots', 'Jon', 'dozen', 'times', 'arrows', 'Not', 'mention', 'get', 'see', 'barely', 'anything', 'Barristan', 'Selmy', 'who', 'Strong', 'Belwas', 'again', 'One', 'biggest', 'complaints', 'here', 'also', 'butchered', 'pun', 'intended', 'Red', 'Wedding', 'most', 'infamous', 'scene', 'entire', 'series', 'messed', 'up', 'First', 'all', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cinematic', 'gold', 'had', 'actually', 'played', 'Reins', 'Castemere', 'massacre', 'rather', 'playing', 'entire', 'song', 'then', 'beginning', 'killings', 'Putting', 'right', 'music', 'right', 'scene', 'something', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'film', 'television', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'even', 'books', 'could', ""n't"", 'show', 'Huge', 'opportunity', 'missed', 'there', 'also', 'felt', 'gore', 'blood', 'were', 'unnecessarily', 'cartoonish', 'points', 'throat', 'slashing', 'effects', 'were', 'straight', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'stomach', 'stabbing', 'scene', 'felt', 'unrealistic', 'awkward', 'Finally', 'scene', 'were', 'Robb', 'actually', 'stabbed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'dramatic', 'show', 'Roose', 'approaching', 'was', 'knees', 'did', 'books', 'then', 'just', 'have', 'pop', 'screen', 'then', 'off', 'again', '1990s', 'animated', 'Batman.Now', ""n't"", 'say', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'points', 'scene', 'where', 'Danaerys', 'Slaver', 'Bay', 'gains', 'unsullied', 'army', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'entire', 'show', 'fact', 'most', 'Essos', 'scenes', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'bit', 'more', 'Barristan', 'Selmy', 'Also', 'scene', 'where', 'Jamie', 'Brienne', 'bear', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Ultimately', 'glowing', 'parts', 'season', 'were', 'bogged', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'crap', 'worst', 'part', ""'ve"", 'painted', 'corner', 'where', 'season', '4', 'concerned', 'once', 'again', 'working', 'only', 'book', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'find', 'way', 'better', 'manage', 'content']",Game of Thrones: Season 3

This story is crying out for some tight editing.First of all I'd drop the Bran story. That kid has been wondering around the woods looking at three eyed crows for the last season and a half. He hasn't really contributed to the plot since he got thrown out of a tower in the first episode. Next to go is Theon Greyjoy. We spent all of season three watching this guy get tortured. Why? And finally I'd drop Stanis Baratheon and the red witch. Should of snuffed this guy at the battle for Kings Landing. Instead we get an entire season of him licking his wounds. None of these people spoke a single word to any of the story's main characters for the entire thrid season.In my opinion there are four great stories here and we should stick with them. Aria's story is great. The Kings Landing stuff is the meat of the story. Jon Snow's adventures beyond the wall, terrific. Daenerys Targaryen's story, great. Everytime we move away from one of those four stories the show comes to a grinding halt while we wait to get back to the characters we care about.Less would be more in season four.",3,Tight Editing Needed,1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,1179,"['Five', 'stars', 'first', 'season', 'four', 'stars', 'second', 'season', 'three', 'stars', 'season', 'story', 'crying', 'out', 'tight', 'editing.First', ""'d"", 'drop', 'Bran', 'story', 'kid', 'been', 'wondering', 'woods', 'looking', 'three', 'eyed', 'crows', 'last', 'season', 'half', ""n't"", 'really', 'contributed', 'plot', 'got', 'thrown', 'tower', 'first', 'episode', 'Next', 'go', 'Theon', 'Greyjoy', 'spent', 'season', 'three', 'watching', 'guy', 'get', 'tortured', 'Why', 'finally', ""'d"", 'drop', 'Stanis', 'Baratheon', 'red', 'witch', 'Should', 'snuffed', 'guy', 'battle', 'Kings', 'Landing', 'Instead', 'get', 'entire', 'season', 'licking', 'wounds', 'None', 'people', 'spoke', 'single', 'word', 'story', 'main', 'characters', 'entire', 'thrid', 'season.In', 'opinion', 'are', 'four', 'great', 'stories', 'here', 'should', 'stick', 'Aria', 'story', 'great', 'Kings', 'Landing', 'stuff', 'meat', 'story', 'Jon', 'Snow', 'adventures', 'wall', 'terrific', 'Daenerys', 'Targaryen', 'story', 'great', 'Everytime', 'move', 'away', 'one', 'four', 'stories', 'show', 'grinding', 'halt', 'wait', 'get', 'back', 'characters', 'care', 'about.Less', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'season', 'four']",Game of Thrones: Season 3

R. Martin's novel (his third) that forms the basis of the series benefits from a streamlined storyline and a slightly reduced group of characters in the TV version. While it isn't necessary to have read the novels it certainly is fascinating to contrast the way that they've elected to tell the same story in different mediums.SPOILERS:Tyrion (Peter Dinklage who continues to give a outstanding performance) recovers from helping to defend the city against the forces of Stannis Baratheon(Stephen Dillane) only to find that his father Tywin (Charles Dance) is seen as the savior of the city and made Hand of the King. Tyrion also discovers that his evil nephew King Joffrey tried to have him murdered on the battlefield.Rob Stark (Richrad Madden) continues to win battles but struggle to keep his fragile alliance together which, ultimately, culminates in the infamous &#34;black wedding&#34; in the penultimate episode of the season.Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) continues to gather her own forces including buying a mercenary army as part of her plans to gradually take back her kingdom.The rest of the Stark children are still on the run.END OF SPOILERS:The Blu-ray looks terrific with a nice, detailed transfer. Blacks are deep and rich while detail is rich throughout.The audio remains outstanding as well with a very active lossless surround him. Subtitles are in English and Spanish.The special features include 12 commentary (some episodes have more than one) tracks with a mix of behind-the-scenes creative folks as well as cast.Featurettes include &#34;A Gathering Storm&#34;, &#34;New Characters&#34; profile and a picture-in-picture piece for the episode  &#34;The Rains of Castamere Unveiled&#34; the most emotionally taxing episode of the series.The deleted and extended scenes are worthwhile checking out as they include pieces that extend the characters but were, undoubtedly, cut for pacing and time.&#34;Inside the Wildlings&#34; gives us a glimpse into the characters beyond the wall while &#34;The Politics of Marriage&#34; lives up to its title focusing on the various unions and why they are pursued.There is also a set of DVDs included in a separate cardboard container. The set is handsomely packaged with a slipcase that features the image you see here of the dragon's shadow.HBO has done an outstanding job of providing additional value for fans who watched the series on their network with their Blu-ray releases.

This is one of televisions most impressive accomplishments to date.  The set designs, costuming, etc are absolutely brilliant.  The acting is superb.I am simultaneously reading Martin's books and I will say that the Game of Thrones series does vary considerably in many respects to the books.  That is understandable.  The books are long and incredibly complex from just about every standpoint.  The books can, in fact, become quite tedious in an over-abundance of detail.  The series cuts off a lot of that fat and does make many substantial changes.This review, however, is primarily about the Game of Thrones: Season 3 Blu-ray/DVD disc set.  As usual, I went on a Game of Thrones viewing binge as soon as I got my set delivered.  My experience with this disc set is that it has worked flawlessly and the quality of the video is first rate. The set contains 5 Blu-ray discs  containing ten episodes.  Disc #5 contains only the final episode of Season 3: &#34;Mhysa&#34;.  Unlike some reviews I have read, I have had no playback issues whatsoever with my Sony Blu-ray player and it is a relatively inexpensive 2 1/2 year-old model.  I did not have to perform any updates or other nonsense that some reviewers talk about.  That may be because the Sony performs automatic updates; I don't really know.  Some reviewers have complained that they were unable to watch any of their older Blu-ray discs or DVDs after performing an update to their player.  Fortunately, I have had no such issues.  My player still plays any of the older DVDs and Blu-ray discs without any problems.I am not going to further review the Game of Thrones Season 3 series itself other than to say that if you are averse to (1) nudity (2) &#34;colorful&#34; language (3) copious amounts of blood  (4)violence then you'd best stay away.  Far away.  Game of Thrones is set in a fantasy Middle Ages type world somewhat similar to but also vastly different from the world of Tolkien's &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34;.  It is not nearly as &#34;gentle&#34; as Tolkien's great work, however.  Just a word of advice for anyone who has not yet seen Game of Thrones: don't get too deeply emotionally attached or invested in ANY character.  You'll be sorry you did. ; )The Game of Throne: Season 3 Blu-ray disc set is another total winner.  Highly recommended to any Game of Thrones fan.",5,Game of Thrones: Season 3 Blu-ray/DVD disc set is another winner,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,2440,"['Game', 'Thrones', 'Season', '3', 'brilliant', 'adaptation', 'George', 'R.R', 'Martin', 'books', 'one', 'televisions', 'most', 'impressive', 'accomplishments', 'date', 'set', 'designs', 'costuming', 'etc', 'are', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'superb.I', 'am', 'simultaneously', 'reading', 'Martin', 'books', 'will', 'say', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'series', 'vary', 'considerably', 'many', 'respects', 'books', 'understandable', 'books', 'are', 'long', 'incredibly', 'complex', 'just', 'standpoint', 'books', 'can', 'fact', 'become', 'quite', 'tedious', 'over-abundance', 'detail', 'series', 'lot', 'fat', 'make', 'many', 'substantial', 'changes.This', 'review', 'however', 'primarily', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'Season', '3', 'Blu-ray/DVD', 'disc', 'set', 'usual', 'went', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'viewing', 'binge', 'as', 'soon', 'got', 'set', 'delivered', 'experience', 'disc', 'set', 'worked', 'flawlessly', 'quality', 'video', 'first', 'rate', 'set', '5', 'Blu-ray', 'discs', 'containing', 'ten', 'episodes', 'Disc', '5', 'contains', 'only', 'final', 'episode', 'Season', '3', '34', 'Mhysa', '34', 'reviews', 'have', 'read', 'have', 'had', 'playback', 'issues', 'Sony', 'Blu-ray', 'player', 'relatively', 'inexpensive', '2', '1/2', 'year-old', 'model', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'perform', 'updates', 'other', 'nonsense', 'reviewers', 'talk', 'may', 'be', 'Sony', 'performs', 'automatic', 'updates', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'reviewers', 'have', 'complained', 'were', 'unable', 'watch', 'older', 'Blu-ray', 'discs', 'DVDs', 'performing', 'update', 'player', 'Fortunately', 'have', 'had', 'such', 'issues', 'My', 'player', 'still', 'older', 'DVDs', 'Blu-ray', 'discs', 'problems.I', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'further', 'review', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'Season', '3', 'series', 'other', 'say', 'are', 'averse', '1', 'nudity', '2', '34', 'colorful', '34', 'language', '3', 'copious', 'amounts', 'blood', '4', 'violence', 'then', ""'d"", 'best', 'stay', 'away', 'Far', 'away', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'set', 'fantasy', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'type', 'world', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'also', 'vastly', 'different', 'world', 'Tolkien', '34', 'Lord', 'Rings', '34', 'not', 'nearly', '34', 'gentle', '34', 'Tolkien', 'great', 'work', 'however', 'Just', 'word', 'advice', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'deeply', 'emotionally', 'attached', 'invested', 'ANY', 'character', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sorry', 'did', 'Game', 'Throne', 'Season', '3', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'set', 'total', 'winner', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'fan']",Game of Thrones: Season 3
