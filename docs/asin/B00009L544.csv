The cover makes the movie look like it has some good potential to be a campy classic...  No such luck.  The main character, Mulva, is painful to look at, and her voice is so terrible I had to keep adjusting the volume. The one saving grace of the film was a short Benny Hill segment that was very well done, and actually got a chuckle out of me.The second movie on this DVD, Filthy McNasty, was actualy better then Mulva, but still lacked the charm I would have liked.  The upside was that no character was SO annoying as to make me want to turn it off.  The demon Phil had phenominal makeup for such a low budget film.All in all, I can't reccomend this film, which is too bad...

I fall somewhere in between the two extremes.  The worst thing about it is the misleading cover.  The attractive model pictured on the cover is not Mulva, and she does not appear in either one of the two movies.  Mulva is actually a short, bespectacled, homely girl with chocolate smeared all over her mouth.When I first started watching the movie I turned it off within minutes.  I couldn't handle the ultra-cheap, shot-on-a-home-video camera look of it all. (I was later shocked to find out it was shot digitally.) A couple days later, some friends and I watched the whole movie.  I remember commenting several times that it was the worst movie I had ever seen.  Other than a few cheap laughs, it seemed that Mulva had nothing to offer.Within a few days my friends and I were imitating the characters' voices, mainly Mulva and Mr. Bonejack.  To date I have watched the movie five times and enjoy it more with each viewing.  Those who are expecting good splatter FX should skip it, though.  It was shot for $2000 so the makeup is pretty bad.  The appeal of the movie lies in its energy, mainly in the ridiculously overwritten dialogue and the exaggerated acting (or nonacting) of the people involved.  It's obvious watching it that everyone had a good time making the film.Filthy McNasty was marginally better made, so I actually liked it less.  It had funny moments, but wasn't as overwhelmingly cheesy as Mulva.  A word of advice: a few drinks will make these movies a lot more tolerable.

Is it really that easy to sell worthless movies through big retailers? People should be careful when they call something the ""worst movie ever"" because they obvioulsy have not seen this garbage.

Robare ""smurfwreck""","[5, 8]","First and foremost, for those who are expecting anything ...[pause], well just don't.There are two types of people who get into the business of making movies, those who do it to get rich and famous and those who do it because they want to no matter what, for the fun of making movies. Doing it for the ""Art"" by the way, is not only pretentious, but also stupid since art is a subjective term that anyone can apply to anything, I mean look at the Dadaists.Anyway, the point is the best films are those made by people without dollar signs gleaming in their eyes, those who take risks, self produce, and make films with or without large audiences, because they love making films. Seaver defines this category. Influenced by those who started out just like him, Peter Jackson, Sam Raimi, Lloyd Kaufman, Tobe Hooper, Chris is making pictures to entertain, to experiment, and to give back to the community he's gotten so much enjoyment from. He's not claiming the kind of quality that most expect from films, but he is giving them the type of quality that people tend to overlook, honesty and effort.  For all those who would dismiss this double feature as crap or a waste of time or money, have probably never even tried to make a film themselves.As for the films on this disc, well they are great when you watch them with no expectations, a little research and knowledge of how they were made, and the ability to not take all film-making so seriously. Here's some free research: Mulva, made for a budget of about $2,000 and stars a fan of LBP previous productions. It was Seaver's first film shot on Digital Video, the previous films were shot on VHS I think, and has cameo appearances by Troma regulars, Trent Haaga, Debbie Rochon, and Lloyd Kaufman himself. Though the picture quality of the DV on this DVD is about medium, it's still a fun and entertaining watch, if you let it. Filthy McNasty, with a larger role for Debbie Rochon, is a little bit more scatological and the picture quality is still medium, but the heart is still there. Both films have commentary, though a lot of it is more fun than informative, but they do help to let the casual viewer in on some of the in-jokes and references.The bottom line is that Chris and his crew are doing what so many would like to do, but don't have the guts to do, they are making films on their own terms and distributing them.",3,Don't take life so seriously...,1093219200,"08 23, 2004",2004,2376,"['First', 'foremost', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'anything', '[', 'pause', ']', 'well', 'just', 'are', 'two', 'types', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'business', 'making', 'movies', 'who', 'do', 'get', 'rich', 'famous', 'who', 'do', 'want', 'matter', 'what', 'fun', 'making', 'movies', 'Doing', 'Art', 'way', 'not', 'only', 'pretentious', 'also', 'stupid', 'art', 'subjective', 'term', 'anyone', 'can', 'apply', 'anything', 'mean', 'look', 'Dadaists.Anyway', 'point', 'best', 'films', 'are', 'made', 'people', 'dollar', 'signs', 'gleaming', 'eyes', 'who', 'take', 'risks', 'produce', 'make', 'films', 'large', 'audiences', 'love', 'making', 'films', 'Seaver', 'category', 'Influenced', 'who', 'started', 'out', 'just', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Lloyd', 'Kaufman', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'Chris', 'making', 'pictures', 'entertain', 'experiment', 'give', 'back', 'community', 'gotten', 'so', 'much', 'enjoyment', 'not', 'claiming', 'kind', 'quality', 'most', 'expect', 'films', 'giving', 'type', 'quality', 'people', 'tend', 'overlook', 'honesty', 'effort', 'who', 'would', 'dismiss', 'double', 'feature', 'crap', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'have', 'probably', 'never', 'even', 'tried', 'make', 'film', 'themselves.As', 'films', 'disc', 'well', 'are', 'great', 'when', 'watch', 'expectations', 'little', 'research', 'knowledge', 'how', 'were', 'made', 'ability', 'not', 'take', 'film-making', 'so', 'seriously', 'Here', 'free', 'research', 'Mulva', 'made', 'budget', '2,000', 'fan', 'LBP', 'previous', 'productions', 'was', 'Seaver', 'first', 'film', 'shot', 'Digital', 'Video', 'previous', 'films', 'were', 'shot', 'VHS', 'think', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'Troma', 'regulars', 'Trent', 'Haaga', 'Debbie', 'Rochon', 'Lloyd', 'Kaufman', 'picture', 'quality', 'DV', 'DVD', 'medium', 'still', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'let', 'Filthy', 'McNasty', 'larger', 'role', 'Debbie', 'Rochon', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'scatological', 'picture', 'quality', 'still', 'medium', 'heart', 'still', 'there', 'films', 'have', 'commentary', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'informative', 'do', 'help', 'let', 'casual', 'viewer', 'in-jokes', 'references.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'Chris', 'crew', 'are', 'doing', 'what', 'so', 'many', 'would', 'like', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'guts', 'do', 'are', 'making', 'films', 'own', 'terms', 'distributing']",Mulva: Zombie Ass Kicker! & Filthy McNasty
