The Batman vs. Dracula is a first-rate animated adventure, and stays remarkably true to the character as envisioned in the somewhat underrated ""The Batman"" series.I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but let's just say that the legendary count considers Batman as something of a kindred spirit.  I initially thought it seemed unnecessary to include the Joker and Penguin.  But their presence serves the story well, and makes for some fun AND creepy moments.  In fact, for a ""kid's movie,"" this gets pretty intense.I know one criticism of the new series is that it tends to emphasize action over character development.  But when you see the superbly-paced first battle between Batman and Dracula, you'll be so caught up in the action that you may not have time to think about anything else.All in all, a terrific effort.

Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[0, 0]","What starts as a treasure hunt by the Penguin soon turns into a near-apocalyptic ordeal when he accidentally revives the legendary Dracula. Immediately, the prince of darkness begins to feed, snatching innocent citizens of Gotham from its streets.Darkness blankets the city and the caped crusader is all who stands in the way between Dracula and the city's doom.Wow. That was my first reaction when watching this. This direct-to-DVD release doesn't view as your standard Batman cartoon. This truly is a monster tale and views more like a horror movie than a superhero flick.The vampires in this film are scary, looking like something between a vampire and a zombie. Dracula himself is neat, trim and suave, yet carries a presence of death.This DVD also introduces Batman's love interest, Vicky Vale (who appeared both in the comics and in the 1989 movie). I have yet to discover how much of a role she will have in the half hour episodes of The Batman series (I have only watched up to season three), but it was great to see her on screen. It was also wonderful to see Bruce Wayne dealing with a female lead in a realistic way and having once again come face to face with Batman getting in the way of his personal life.A surprising touch to this film was the Joker, not so much the character but what happens to him. Cool indeed.This is a solid Bat flick, one which is meant for an older audience, definitely, not for kids. 13 or 14 and up, I'd say.This flick is a keeper, one every true Bat fan should have.A.P.

His own made for video feature.If you haven't read what I said regarding this new dark knight animated series. I suggest you read my review of the first season of this new Batman. (Under The Batman - The Complete First Season (DC Comics Kids Collection). If you haven't the next paragraph  will be an abridged repeat of that.This new version of Batman year one is good animation . It is better than most of recent cartoons that is out there. This is a cartoon version of the film Batman Begins, it works in some ways and fails in others. This Batman may have the cave, the tools and the toys-but he is very green and still learning how to put it all together. The modern day non art demo of this cartoon works as well. The voice talent for this Batman is first rate. Now the BAD news, the animation of most of the Batman's arch-villains seem off in my opinion... too weird and strange from the classic Batman Mythos-the Comics of old. Remember this isn't your father's BatmanNow that we are up to speed of what I think of the new Batman. Lets tackle this Made for video DVD.This pairings of the Dark Knights is a great feature, playing on their dark nature of Dracula  and Bruce Wayne's nativeness as the New Batman. The sub plots with Penguin and Joker mesh well in this story line. The ending came too pat and quick for me, I wished it left it open for an animated  sequel.The voice work on this feature is great, not so Hollywood as Batman the Animated series made for DVD movie ""Secrets of the Batwoman.""  The  Animation is interesting and works on many levels. It doesn't hype itself to grand levels. but better than most of the new  animation shows on Cartoon Network. The story line has been treated in comics (the graphic novel Red Rain), but this DVD goes further and makes this animated work special.It impressed me and I dont impress that easyIn my opinion,  the wide-screen version of this cartoon  should have been in theaters next to BATMAN BEGINS as a second feature.

It's much more Mature and adult-oriented, in my opinion. The story begins with Penguin finding out about a treasure that was buried in a Gotham Cemetary. Only the Joker knows of the treasure as well. Yet, while Joker is squaring off against The Batman, Penguin finds its' whereabouts. Unknowingly, Penguin cuts his hand on his umbrella and brings Dracula back to life. Soon thereafter, Penguin becomes a slave to the Prince of Darkness &, in no time at all, Gotham's Denizens starts becoming an army of the undead for Dracula. Heck, The Joker even becomes one. Vicky Vale, Bruce's love interest, figures in there as well.

Long ""brent6980""","[1, 1]","(Continued from my reviews on The Batman - The Complete Season One & The Batman - The Complete Season Two)I made ""vs. Dracula"" the third part of my review progression on The Batman, simply because as I watched through the series, I watched it between the second and third seasons. Chronologically, that is where it seemed to fit best. Realistically, it was released to DVD, and subsequently aired, a few episodes into Season Three, though it also could have fit between the first two seasons or anytime during Season Two.To keep with the comparing to B:TAS, it's no Mask Of The Phantasm or Return Of The Joker (Batman Beyond), but I really enjoyed this DTV movie. Perhaps, I'm slightly biased, as I like stories about vampires. Because there was more time for story development, it has that advantage over any episode of the series, even the two-parters, though I did feel the plot dragging in places. Another thing it has in its favor is, though it aired on TV, it was still DTV and took some liberty in being unrated here in the States. That helps when trying to satisfy an older audience, though I think some of the content is a little much for the 7 year old plus crowd I referred to in my review on Season One.Besides the obvious main villain, The Joker and Penguin are also featured in this film. It also contains Vicki Vale's only prominent animated appearance. (After this was released, she made small ""cameos"" in the DCUAOMs Superman/Batman: Apocalypse and Batman: Year One). When it is revealed how Dracula ever came to be in Gotham, it is very conceivable. As I touched on briefly in my review of Season One, gadgets, and the science behind them, are a major part of the whole series, especially early on. That being said, science plays a major role in The Batman's treatment of the circumstances at hand, which always makes a good vampire story better, in my opinion.In summary, this was one of the highest points of the series, though there have definitely been some stand out episodes that are up there, too. I rate all the seasons at 4 stars, simply because you have to take 13 episodes at once. Truly, some episodes are fives and some I rate less than four. If you only watch one item from this series, this movie is what I would suggest. If I had not liked what I had seen so far, this film would make me go back and try it out again.

921451,A10U5D2T50JREX,B000A59PLU,Darrell Heath,"[49, 56]","As far as animated Batman series go I much prefer the series that ran during the '90's on the WB rather than the current incarnation. In fact I've only seen a mere handful of the new series and just wasn't inspired enough to tune in for more.  Well, if this direct to DVD movie is anything to go by I may have to change that attitude.I had no intention of buying this DVD (no really, I swear I didn't) but something made me take a chance on it while I was picking up the other Batman DVD releases on that fateful Tuesday afternoon.  Frankly I'm glad I did because ""Batman vs Dracula"" is really a dang good animated Batman adventure and a fine Halloween treat to boot.  Now I won't claim it to be perfect (because it isn't) but it is a more than decent direct to DVD release.The story involves Joker and Penguin escaping from Arkham Asylum in search of a treasure hidden within the depths of Gotham Cemetary.  The Joker/Penguin alliance falls apart and it is the Penguin who stmbles not upon the treasure but the remains of Count Dracula himself.  In true Hammer film style Penguin accidently resurrects Dracula, becomes his thrall and the two begin to unleash a reign of terror upon Gotham City as the Count begins to transform its citizens into vampires.  The creation of these ""Lost Ones"" is blamed on the Dark Knight and he begins to realize he has more on his hands than the average maniacal super villain he usually has to contend with.  The irony of two individuals who use a bat as their avatar to achieve their ends is not lost upon Dracula (or the writers) and he soon sets out to destroy the Cowled One.  I won't go into any more of the plot, you get the general idea.  However I should point out that the writers have included a few more story threads and plot twists than what I've revealed here and thats what makes this film both enjoyable and a bit frustrating.  On the one hand there is more substance to the story than I would have expected for what is generally considered ""kiddie fare"" and while there are some good adult oriented story ideas and concepts they aren't always as fully explored as I would have liked.  Still, its hard to fault this film too much.  I can tell that the film makers were genuinely enthusiastic about the project and that really comes across in the final product more than any flaws and plot holes the film may have.A word of warning to parents of small children.  This film does contain considerable amounts of blood and violence not to mention the sheer creepiness of many of the vampire scenes.  If you have little ones who are easily frightened you may want to pass on this particular Batman adventure.  When I say that the vampires are creepy I mean just that.  There were one or two moments when even this jaded horror movie junkie got a goosebump or two.  The sight of a vampire Joker lapping blood up off the floor (while not the creepiest scene in the film) is one I'll not get out of my head for awhile.As for the DVD itself: the transfer is good and crisp and the sound is presented in Dolby 5.1.  No widescreen unfortunately.  A few meager extras such as the voice actors hamming it up, a science vs superstition segment, and trailers round out the supplemental features.Bottom line: this isn't the greatest animated Batman yarn out there but it is a good thrill ride none the less.  It offers more substance than many films of its kind and will appeal to adults and older kids alike.  I can't reccomend it for sensitive younger viewers but for the older kids and adults who would like a good Batman Halloween treat you can't go wrong with this one.",4,Better Than I Had Thought It Would Be,1129680000,"10 19, 2005",2005,3608,"['As', 'far', 'animated', 'Batman', 'series', 'go', 'much', 'prefer', 'series', 'ran', ""'90"", 'WB', 'rather', 'current', 'incarnation', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'mere', 'handful', 'new', 'series', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'inspired', 'enough', 'tune', 'more', 'Well', 'direct', 'DVD', 'movie', 'anything', 'go', 'may', 'have', 'change', 'attitude.I', 'had', 'intention', 'buying', 'DVD', 'really', 'swear', 'did', ""n't"", 'something', 'made', 'take', 'chance', 'was', 'picking', 'up', 'other', 'Batman', 'DVD', 'fateful', 'Tuesday', 'afternoon', 'Frankly', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Batman', 'vs', 'Dracula', 'really', 'dang', 'good', 'animated', 'Batman', 'adventure', 'fine', 'Halloween', 'treat', 'boot', 'Now', 'wo', ""n't"", 'claim', 'be', 'perfect', ""n't"", 'more', 'decent', 'direct', 'DVD', 'release.The', 'story', 'Joker', 'Penguin', 'escaping', 'Arkham', 'Asylum', 'search', 'treasure', 'hidden', 'depths', 'Gotham', 'Cemetary', 'Joker/Penguin', 'alliance', 'apart', 'Penguin', 'who', 'not', 'treasure', 'remains', 'Count', 'Dracula', 'true', 'Hammer', 'film', 'style', 'Penguin', 'accidently', 'Dracula', 'thrall', 'two', 'begin', 'unleash', 'reign', 'terror', 'Gotham', 'City', 'Count', 'transform', 'citizens', 'vampires', 'creation', 'Lost', 'Ones', 'blamed', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'realize', 'more', 'hands', 'average', 'maniacal', 'super', 'villain', 'usually', 'contend', 'irony', 'two', 'individuals', 'who', 'use', 'bat', 'avatar', 'achieve', 'ends', 'not', 'lost', 'Dracula', 'writers', 'soon', 'out', 'destroy', 'Cowled', 'One', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'more', 'plot', 'get', 'general', 'idea', 'However', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'writers', 'have', 'included', 'few', 'more', 'story', 'threads', 'plot', 'twists', 'what', ""'ve"", 'revealed', 'here', 'thats', 'what', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'bit', 'frustrating', 'one', 'hand', 'more', 'substance', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'what', 'generally', 'considered', 'kiddie', 'fare', 'are', 'good', 'adult', 'oriented', 'story', 'ideas', 'concepts', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'fully', 'explored', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'Still', 'hard', 'fault', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'can', 'tell', 'film', 'makers', 'were', 'genuinely', 'enthusiastic', 'project', 'really', 'final', 'product', 'more', 'flaws', 'plot', 'holes', 'film', 'may', 'have.A', 'word', 'warning', 'parents', 'small', 'children', 'film', 'contain', 'considerable', 'amounts', 'blood', 'violence', 'not', 'mention', 'sheer', 'creepiness', 'many', 'vampire', 'scenes', 'have', 'little', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'easily', 'frightened', 'may', 'want', 'pass', 'particular', 'Batman', 'adventure', 'When', 'say', 'vampires', 'are', 'creepy', 'mean', 'just', 'that', 'were', 'one', 'two', 'moments', 'when', 'even', 'jaded', 'horror', 'movie', 'junkie', 'got', 'goosebump', 'two', 'sight', 'vampire', 'Joker', 'lapping', 'blood', 'up', 'floor', 'not', 'creepiest', 'scene', 'film', 'one', ""'ll"", 'not', 'get', 'head', 'awhile.As', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'good', 'crisp', 'sound', 'presented', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'widescreen', 'unfortunately', 'few', 'meager', 'extras', 'such', 'voice', 'actors', 'hamming', 'up', 'science', 'vs', 'superstition', 'segment', 'trailers', 'round', 'supplemental', 'features.Bottom', 'line', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'animated', 'Batman', 'there', 'good', 'thrill', 'ride', 'less', 'more', 'substance', 'many', 'films', 'kind', 'will', 'appeal', 'adults', 'older', 'kids', 'alike', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reccomend', 'sensitive', 'younger', 'viewers', 'older', 'kids', 'adults', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'good', 'Batman', 'Halloween', 'treat', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'one']",The Batman vs Dracula

Some readers might not know that this film is not related to the original Batman: The Animated Series that ran from 1992 to 1998. This is a much more action driven series that focuses less on characters and more on fight scenes. These ideals translate into this new film. This DVD in not rated but if it did come with one it would be PG-13 due to the amount of action-violence, disturbing imagery, and blood. Yes, this movie is about Batman fighting the legendary Dracula so it's to be expected that there would be a lot on blood on screen but it is still shocking to see so much blood in this cartoon movie. The storyline borrows heavely from vampire movies of the past but it steals a lot of it's plot from the live-action Blade Trilogy. As a big Batman fan I must say it's impressive to see him go up against Dracula bat-to-back, so to speak. The animation is impressive to watch and the voice acting is very well accomplished.

I'm not a nerd or a crazy fan boy, but this was a solid effort. The animation, the fights, the story (of course it wasn't an amazing story, but is kept me captivated).Honestly, I wish some of these scenes could have been adapted  into live action. The fight scene with Dracula on the rooftop, the huntdown for Joker in the lab, and the final battle between Bat and Drac would have me salivating if it were live action. These animated fight scenes are, without a doubt, FAR superior to the fight scenes in Batman Begins. I mean c'mon, could any of you actually see what was happening through all that blur in Batman Begins? If you could, I envy you because there were probably some good moves in there, but who knows...Yes (back to Batman vs. Dracula), the story is kinda stupid at certain moments such as: Dracula's relocation from Transylvania to Gotham, Penguin being Dracula's tour guide through Gotham, Batman using his phenomonal detective skills to figure out that Alucard is Dracula backwards, etc... But we must remember that us 20 something year olds are not the target audience. This is for the kids man.Actually though, I don't know if it's exactly suitable for the little ones either. There are a lot of creepy parts. Not for us no, but for kids that have a bed time and still wet their beds, yes. Which leads me to ask: Did anyone else think that little girl singing under the street light was scary? I did. Creepy kids creep me out. Remember those stupid little girls in the ""Nightmare On Elm St."" movies that would play jump rope and sing? I STILL have nightmares about those creepy little broads man!Anyway, the stuff I found cool in Batman vs. Dracula would probably be scary to my nephew (then again he's a little wimp so I don't really know what to tell you... sorry).Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and will watch it again in the near future. I really would have rather seen this movie as a live action film. Yes, I said it! Hey, if they can make Dracula go toe to toe with Blade in a crappy film called ""Blade:Trinty""... Then there's no reason this animated film couldn't have been made into a live action film. Sound like something a nerd might say? So what...

However, having read so many good reviews on it, I decided to plunk down $20 bucks and give it a chance. I AM GLAD I DID!As far as compared to the original Batman animated series storyline in terms of the animated films, I would have to rank it either third or tied with Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker (Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm WILL ALWAYS BE number one to me)! Though not rated, I wouldn't recommended to young kids. Much like ""Phantasm"" and ""Return Of The Joker"", I would only recommend it to young teens or adults that are fans because there are some intense scenes in it.As for the film itself, I think the makers of Blade: Trinity could've took notes on how to really bring out Dracula as THE BATMAN's version is very good! It sticks to the legend but goes about it very smartly and even educates on what's fact and what's fiction on vampirism! I was also surprised to see the introduction of Vicky Vale, one of the few characters that the original Batman: The Animated Series DIDN'T use!I also find this version of Batman has a bit more of a lighter side than the one we are used too but still retains a lot of the ""dark knight"" side. The use of Vale to show the conflict between his own desires and his commitment to being the champion of Gotham was well done too. While I would've liked to have seen it explored further, this wasn't about Bruce's love life so I can live with what was shown.Another thing I hated about this version is their Joker! But, on the plus side, I DO like their version of The Penguin! In this feature, I think both are handled well. The Joker is probably at his most frightening and slightly disturbing in this one! While not on the level with the classic Mark Hamil version, he comes very close here!As for the fights, they were handled well and it made sense too. Batman basically had to use smarts here because while he is the ultimate of physical perfection, Dracula IS Dracula so physical strength, endurance and even weapons wouldn't be enough this time around!Overall, I think even detractors of THE BATMAN series will like this feature!

921462,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000A59PLU,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[8, 8]","I was bummed out when BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES and JUSTICE LEAGUE (UNLIMITED) were taken off the television. I did give the new BATMAN series a try, but I couldn't really get into it. Part of the reason, no doubt, is that I miss Kevin Conroy's never-to-be-surpassed voice portrayal of Batman/Bruce Wayne. Another reason is that the new series just isn't as good as the classic 1990s version. Nevertheless, on a whim, I purchased this animated movie and, to my surprise, ended up enjoying it. The Batman meets his perfect adversarial foil in the sanguinary Count, who taunts our hero: ""Try as you may, you cannot out-bat me."" This version of the Caped Crusader might be younger and, therefore, not as experienced or battle tested, but the same intensity and obsessive brooding are present. Definitely, he broods more here than he does in his regular series. True, Rino Romano isn't Kevin Conroy, but there's an earnestness and a certain timbre in his voice that made me not be as critical as I might've been. By the same token, Kevin Michael Richardson isn't Mark Hamill, but I actually relished Richardson's different take on the demented Joker, whose latest incarnation here seems to be more formidable than ever.The storyline: The Joker and the Penguin's escape from Arkham Asylum accidentally leads to the resurrection of Count Dracula. Soon thereafter, Gotham citizens, dubbed the ""lost ones,"" alarmingly begin to vanish. When the Batman investigates, he ends up clashing with the original bat-man, who then proceeds to convincingly stomp on him in their first tussle. Nevertheless, the Dark Knight is intent on not only defeating the master vampire but also on curing his infected victims. However, as the plague of vampirism continues to contaminate Gotham and the ranks of Dracula's children of the night swell, the Batman realizes that time is indeed drastically running out. But can his specially crafted arsenal of garlic bombs and antidote bullets save the night and Vicki Vale, on whom the Count's covetous eyes have set? And where do the Joker and the Penguin fit in all this bloody mess?At 84 minutes, BATMAN VS. DRACULA is an eerie, atmospheric film which might prove to be too intense for the tots. There are moments rife with neck-sucking and visions of blood rampantly gushing, pouring, and dripping. But the more adult audience will find this dark adventure of the Batman to be diverting stuff. There are neat battle sequences between Drac and Bats somewhat done ala MATRIX style. These confrontations are executed in such a way that the viewer is made fully cognizant of just how vulnerable the Batman is and how precarious is his situation as he tries to hold his own against the supernaturally powerful Dracula, who can willfully disrupt the senses and move in a literal blur.BATMAN VS. DRACULA is perfect Halloween fare; in fact, this dvd was released about two weeks before Halloween. The voice acting is good, if not stellar. The animation is decent, on par with the Batman's current series and is reminiscent of the JACKIE CHAN ADVENTURES, which isn't that surprising when you factor in artist/animator Jeff Matsuda, who had a hand in crafting both shows. Anyway, it's a pretty entertaining animated movie, and, based on my enjoyment of it, I just might have to give THE BATMAN another chance.",3,This belfry isn't big enough for the both of them,1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,3322,"['was', 'bummed', 'out', 'when', 'BATMAN', 'ANIMATED', 'SERIES', 'JUSTICE', 'LEAGUE', 'UNLIMITED', 'were', 'taken', 'off', 'television', 'did', 'give', 'new', 'BATMAN', 'series', 'try', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'Part', 'reason', 'doubt', 'miss', 'Kevin', 'Conroy', 'never-to-be-surpassed', 'voice', 'portrayal', 'Batman/Bruce', 'Wayne', 'reason', 'new', 'series', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'classic', '1990s', 'version', 'Nevertheless', 'whim', 'purchased', 'animated', 'movie', 'surprise', 'ended', 'up', 'enjoying', 'Batman', 'perfect', 'adversarial', 'foil', 'sanguinary', 'Count', 'who', 'hero', 'Try', 'may', 'can', 'not', 'out-bat', 'version', 'Caped', 'Crusader', 'might', 'be', 'younger', 'therefore', 'not', 'experienced', 'battle', 'tested', 'same', 'intensity', 'obsessive', 'brooding', 'are', 'present', 'Definitely', 'broods', 'more', 'here', 'regular', 'series', 'True', 'Rino', 'Romano', ""n't"", 'Kevin', 'Conroy', 'earnestness', 'certain', 'timbre', 'voice', 'made', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'critical', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'same', 'token', 'Kevin', 'Michael', 'Richardson', ""n't"", 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'actually', 'relished', 'Richardson', 'different', 'take', 'demented', 'Joker', 'latest', 'incarnation', 'here', 'be', 'more', 'formidable', 'ever.The', 'storyline', 'Joker', 'Penguin', 'escape', 'Arkham', 'Asylum', 'accidentally', 'resurrection', 'Count', 'Dracula', 'Soon', 'thereafter', 'Gotham', 'citizens', 'dubbed', 'lost', 'ones', 'alarmingly', 'begin', 'vanish', 'When', 'Batman', 'up', 'clashing', 'original', 'bat-man', 'who', 'then', 'convincingly', 'stomp', 'first', 'tussle', 'Nevertheless', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'intent', 'not', 'only', 'defeating', 'master', 'vampire', 'also', 'curing', 'infected', 'victims', 'However', 'plague', 'vampirism', 'contaminate', 'Gotham', 'ranks', 'Dracula', 'children', 'night', 'swell', 'Batman', 'time', 'indeed', 'drastically', 'running', 'out', 'can', 'specially', 'crafted', 'arsenal', 'garlic', 'bombs', 'antidote', 'bullets', 'save', 'night', 'Vicki', 'Vale', 'whom', 'Count', 'covetous', 'eyes', 'have', 'set', 'where', 'do', 'Joker', 'Penguin', 'fit', 'bloody', 'mess', '84', 'minutes', 'BATMAN', 'VS.', 'DRACULA', 'eerie', 'atmospheric', 'film', 'might', 'prove', 'be', 'too', 'intense', 'tots', 'are', 'moments', 'rife', 'neck-sucking', 'visions', 'blood', 'rampantly', 'gushing', 'pouring', 'dripping', 'more', 'adult', 'audience', 'will', 'find', 'dark', 'adventure', 'Batman', 'be', 'diverting', 'stuff', 'are', 'neat', 'battle', 'sequences', 'Drac', 'Bats', 'somewhat', 'done', 'ala', 'MATRIX', 'style', 'confrontations', 'are', 'executed', 'such', 'way', 'viewer', 'made', 'fully', 'cognizant', 'just', 'how', 'vulnerable', 'Batman', 'how', 'precarious', 'situation', 'hold', 'own', 'supernaturally', 'powerful', 'Dracula', 'who', 'can', 'willfully', 'disrupt', 'senses', 'move', 'literal', 'blur.BATMAN', 'VS.', 'DRACULA', 'perfect', 'Halloween', 'fare', 'fact', 'dvd', 'was', 'released', 'two', 'weeks', 'Halloween', 'voice', 'acting', 'good', 'not', 'stellar', 'animation', 'decent', 'par', 'Batman', 'current', 'series', 'reminiscent', 'JACKIE', 'CHAN', 'ADVENTURES', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'when', 'factor', 'artist/animator', 'Jeff', 'Matsuda', 'who', 'had', 'hand', 'crafting', 'shows', 'Anyway', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'animated', 'movie', 'based', 'enjoyment', 'just', 'might', 'have', 'give', 'THE', 'BATMAN', 'chance']",The Batman vs Dracula

The color pallet is suitably drab and washed out and it does have a decent amount of atmosphere but I can't help but think that it could have been better if it just didn't seem toned down.I prefer the 90s series of Batman, which had an overwhelming amount of darkness and Gothic pathos. This new THE Batman series appears to be reconfigured to appeal to kids who weren't even born in that decade. I know it's a clich&eacute; to moan that animated shows were always better when my age-group were kids, but it's so true.The Penguin and The Joker (now looking like a cross between Krusty the Clown and The Predator) escape from Arkham (there's something new) and make their way to a hidden treasure trove in the cemetery. But the bird stumbles upon Dracula's tomb (why he is in Gotham is not explained) and resurrects him by accident.But The Batman doesn't approve of a Vampireman stalking his streets and a drawn-out conflict with a predictable and hokey ending fills up the rest of the movie. It's fun, it's entertaining, but it's just not the Batman I'm used to.The DVD is in good looking 1.33:1 full frame with Dolby 5.1 sound and a fair amount of extras. But why, in an age of almost every household having a widescreen TV (be it HD or not), animated features such as this are STILL being transferred in full frame is beyond me.

The drawing was crude and unsatisfactory, based on The Batman TV series from 2005 (which I never liked). Voice cast is from The Batman TV series, not Batman The Animated Series of the 1990s, which is a disappointment. No one else can do The Joker like Mark Hamil. I miss him as The Joker. This film does have Tara Strong as Vicki Vale--she used to do Batgirl in the 1990s series. The film has extras with directors, producers, actors discussing the movie and the characters. The extra features were few in number, but useful.The Penguin (Tom Kenny) resurrects Dracula, who for some reason is buried in Gotham City's cemetery. Penguin becomes his manservant as Dracula vampirizes the city. The lost ones become vampires (who resemble zombies here). Bruce (Rino Romano) has to figure out how to cure the humans, which has to do with creating a serum that changes them back That part was interesting. But defeating Dracula takes several tries, with several failures. Finally Batman uses his artificial solar projector to defeat Dracula. Just flash the sun on him. Vampire movies have repeatedly shown that ultraviolet light destroys vampires. Bruce should have figured that out in the beginning.The film includes the character Carmilla Karnstein as the bride of Dracula, which has been done in many other vampire films. So the conflation of Le Fanu's Carmilla with Stoker's Dracula has been done before. Boring. I found the film to be slow, and crudely drawn, and lacking in originality. Fans of vampire films will find nothing new here. I was especially irritated by their rendering of The Joker--too grotesque and are you kidding me? But the producers said they wanted to see what would happen if The Joker became a vampire. And, the best part was that Batman captured the vampirized Joker and used him as a guinea pig to find the cure. He had to cure The Joker first before he could cure the rest of the people. Lots of fighting--with deliberate parallels between Batman and Dracula are drawn--even to how they got around Gotham City by catacombs.on the whole a mediocre movie--not as good as some other Batman films (such as Mask of the Phantasm, which was much better, in fact SubZero was better than this)",3,"Crude drawing, not a satisfactory film",1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,2255,"['film', 'only', 'o.k', 'not', 'more', 'drawing', 'was', 'crude', 'unsatisfactory', 'based', 'Batman', 'TV', 'series', '2005', 'never', 'liked', 'Voice', 'cast', 'Batman', 'TV', 'series', 'not', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', '1990s', 'disappointment', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'do', 'Joker', 'Mark', 'Hamil', 'miss', 'Joker', 'film', 'have', 'Tara', 'Strong', 'Vicki', 'Vale', 'used', 'do', 'Batgirl', '1990s', 'series', 'film', 'extras', 'directors', 'producers', 'actors', 'discussing', 'movie', 'characters', 'extra', 'features', 'were', 'few', 'number', 'useful.The', 'Penguin', 'Tom', 'Kenny', 'Dracula', 'who', 'reason', 'buried', 'Gotham', 'City', 'cemetery', 'Penguin', 'manservant', 'Dracula', 'city', 'lost', 'ones', 'become', 'vampires', 'who', 'resemble', 'zombies', 'here', 'Bruce', 'Rino', 'Romano', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'cure', 'humans', 'do', 'creating', 'serum', 'back', 'part', 'was', 'interesting', 'defeating', 'Dracula', 'several', 'tries', 'several', 'failures', 'Finally', 'Batman', 'artificial', 'solar', 'projector', 'defeat', 'Dracula', 'Just', 'flash', 'sun', 'Vampire', 'movies', 'have', 'repeatedly', 'shown', 'ultraviolet', 'light', 'destroys', 'vampires', 'Bruce', 'should', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'beginning.The', 'film', 'character', 'Carmilla', 'Karnstein', 'bride', 'Dracula', 'been', 'done', 'many', 'other', 'vampire', 'films', 'conflation', 'Le', 'Fanu', 'Carmilla', 'Stoker', 'Dracula', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'Boring', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'slow', 'crudely', 'drawn', 'lacking', 'originality', 'Fans', 'vampire', 'films', 'will', 'find', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'was', 'especially', 'irritated', 'rendering', 'Joker', 'too', 'grotesque', 'are', 'kidding', 'producers', 'said', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'Joker', 'became', 'vampire', 'best', 'part', 'was', 'Batman', 'captured', 'vampirized', 'Joker', 'used', 'guinea', 'pig', 'find', 'cure', 'had', 'cure', 'Joker', 'first', 'could', 'cure', 'rest', 'people', 'Lots', 'fighting', 'deliberate', 'parallels', 'Batman', 'Dracula', 'are', 'drawn', 'even', 'how', 'got', 'Gotham', 'City', 'catacombs.on', 'whole', 'mediocre', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'Batman', 'films', 'such', 'Mask', 'Phantasm', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'fact', 'SubZero', 'was', 'better']",The Batman vs Dracula

921478,A2BC6YTTOZ98KB,B000A59PLU,MISSterio,"[1, 1]","Summary: It's a typical night for Batman: when Penguin and Joker escape Arkham, he tries to capture and bring them back. Well...not this time. In his attempt to get the badguys, he watches as Joker plumits to his doom, while the Penguin stumbles across an odd gravestone which he believes contains valuable treasure -- WRONG! Unfortunately for Penguin, he happens to unleash the vampire lord, Dracula, onto to Gotham City. Now Batman has his hands full from keeping the city from turning into vampires -- all the while -- trying to keep his date, Vicky Vale, from falling into the wrong hands.My Opinion: This definetely isn't your average Batman movie to watch, and even though (like the rest of The Batman episodes) it has great animation, but the story could use a little tweaking. I mean -- come on, Dracula just 'happens' to be in Gotham City, New York? That just seems a little too coincidental, if you ask me. It would make more sense if Batman had to go to Transylvania for some reason (like on a mission/bussines, or something like that).If this movie is supposed to be diverted towards younger children (like around 10 years), then they need to tone down the 'blood' content in this. Don't get me wrong, vampires are all about blood, but I think they showed it a little too much. For example, there is a scene where Batman fights off a vampire Joker at a blood bank. When Batman slams into a shelf of blood viles, the whole thing tilts to the side and starts pouring down on the walls -- and even Joker himself -- like some kind of waterfall; and you even witness the vampire Joker drinking it off the walls and floor -- now that's just gross!The vampires, even Dracula, are down right creepy in this movie, so I do give credit to the animators on that one. What's also creepy, is the fact the vampires can see a human's 'heartbeat'...oh yes, that's creepy. What creeps me out the most in this movie is that vampire Joker. He's got to be the scariest vampire in the movie. If you thought he acted demented and weird in the regular cartoons, you're in for a big surprise when you watch this movie!Overall: Even though I think the creators took some things a little too far in this movie, but overall, it's not a bad movie to watch (especially when it comes to be around Halloween)! This movie also brings out Bruce's/Batman's character a little more, like why he can't have a serious relationship with a woman.Also, even though this is just my opinion, but I wish Joker was in it more (since I'm a big fan to the new animated Joker and all). Hopefully, the creators will think about doing a movie all about the newly animated Joker.

But damned if I didn't love it.First thing's first:  This is not the Dark Knight of Batman: TAS.  This incarnation is less dark.  He's a younger version.  He's not jaded or grumpy, and his stories are very action oriented.  I think it's a mistake to say this series isn't as sophisticated as Batman: TAS.  At first, I thought that, but the more I watch it the more it impresses me.  The Batman is not as complex as B:TAS, but it's really grown on me.And this movie is a great illustration why.  It could've been so lame.  I remember when Spider-Man fought vampires in his most recent cartoon series.  They couldn't even say the word ""Blood"".  How can you do a decent vampire story with that kind of constraint?  Thankfully, B vs D doesn't.  There's blood.  And lots of it.  And dozens of creepy vampires.  And some truly excellent storytelling coupled with superbly animated action scenes.There's so many great moments in this film that I can't even begin to describe them.  Nor would I want to spoil them.  But I'll give one:  Penguin makes a great Renfield.  That's all.  The rest you have to find out for yourself.The Batman isn't Batman: TAS.

Over all this movie was great, but I would like to see how the Batman Beyond-the new Dark knight would handle this undead foe. Its good to be the BATS...",5,Drac Vs  Bats....

921494,A31M2QHES2IMB,B000A59PLU,"Steven Scott ""LeChuck""","[2, 2]","So here's The Batman's first attempt at a stand alone feature length movie,  and while it is no Phantasm (arguably the best animated Batman movie ever), it doesn't fall flat on its face either.  It actually raises the bar for the series and the tone is consistently dark throughout.  I let a lot of the things that bothered me slide (still can't get used to the new Joker, Penguin designs/voices)  and just enjoyed the movie on its own merit.Citizens of Gotham go missing whom the media have dubbed ""The Lost Ones"".  Batman does his best to track them down, while getting attacked by vampires at night.  He knows what is responsible, but has to prove it, and by doing so, prove his innocence in the matter.  Dracula is a great villain and definitely worthy of Batman's skill.  Penguin and Joker also play supporting roles here but not to the point of outshining the titular villain.  I was a little dissapointed that Gordon didn't make an appearance but Alfred picks up the slack.  Vicky Vale also appears as Bruce's love interest/damsel in distress, but she's pleasant and voiced by Tara Strong (TNBA's Batgirl) so I didn't mind.It's pretty predictable and I never once had any doubt how it would end, but it was fun while it lasted and the action between Batman and Dracula was well storyboarded.  I was a little surprised that they didn't really shy away from the violence as there is some decent blood gushing moments.  Also a bonus was that it was a solo Bat tale, so no sidekicks to steal his thunder.  A decent first outing for a ""The Batman"" feature.  If there's another, there's definitely room for improvement, but they could do a lot worse too.",3,A decent Bat feature,1203379200,"02 19, 2008",2008,1655,"['So', 'here', 'Batman', 'first', 'attempt', 'stand', 'alone', 'feature', 'length', 'movie', 'Phantasm', 'arguably', 'best', 'animated', 'Batman', 'movie', 'ever', ""n't"", 'fall', 'flat', 'face', 'actually', 'bar', 'series', 'tone', 'consistently', 'dark', 'let', 'lot', 'things', 'bothered', 'slide', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'used', 'new', 'Joker', 'Penguin', 'designs/voices', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'own', 'merit.Citizens', 'Gotham', 'go', 'missing', 'whom', 'media', 'have', 'dubbed', 'Lost', 'Ones', 'Batman', 'best', 'track', 'down', 'getting', 'attacked', 'vampires', 'night', 'what', 'responsible', 'prove', 'doing', 'so', 'prove', 'innocence', 'matter', 'Dracula', 'great', 'villain', 'definitely', 'worthy', 'Batman', 'skill', 'Penguin', 'Joker', 'also', 'play', 'supporting', 'roles', 'here', 'not', 'point', 'outshining', 'titular', 'villain', 'was', 'little', 'dissapointed', 'Gordon', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'appearance', 'Alfred', 'up', 'slack', 'Vicky', 'Vale', 'also', 'Bruce', 'love', 'interest/damsel', 'distress', 'pleasant', 'voiced', 'Tara', 'Strong', 'TNBA', 'Batgirl', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind.It', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'never', 'once', 'had', 'doubt', 'how', 'would', 'end', 'was', 'fun', 'lasted', 'action', 'Batman', 'Dracula', 'was', 'well', 'storyboarded', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'shy', 'away', 'violence', 'decent', 'blood', 'gushing', 'moments', 'Also', 'bonus', 'was', 'was', 'solo', 'Bat', 'tale', 'sidekicks', 'steal', 'thunder', 'decent', 'first', 'outing', 'Batman', 'feature', 'definitely', 'room', 'improvement', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'too']",The Batman vs Dracula

The Penguin unknowingly unleashes the forces of darkness upon fair Gotham and the Batman is the only one who can stop him.Released prior to Halloween 2005, this dvd is a great addition to the Batman legend.

921496,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B000A59PLU,V. Berk,"[0, 0]","I am someone who has never fond of Warner Bros. The Batman.  It just always struck me as trying too hard to be different from the classic DC Animated Universe incarnation of the character, never knowing whether to be serious or silly- but one thing was for sure, and that's that the show produced lots of ideas that lent themselves to merchandising. In all honesty it was an okay superhero cartoon, but it seldom felt like Batman to me.  An occasional episode would pop up which did a good job of capturing the spirit of the character, but for the most part the series came across as being more style over substance.Now that brings us to The Batman's straight to TV/DVD movie- a feature which boasts a title I never thought I'd see taken seriously outside of a Silver Age comic: The Batman versus Dracula.  And...It's actually a remarkably well made piece.  It isn't a great animated feature on the levels of Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, or Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker, nor does adding Dracula to the Batman universe really add anything, but what The Batman versus Dracula does do is successfully focus on what works in its animated series while shaving off most of its weaknesses.The movie was of course produced solely for the novelty of pitting the Dark Knight against the Prince of Darkness, but the team behind it does give it their all and creates a solid action film out of what could have easily been a cheesy Halloween special for the series.  Dracula is treated as a serious villain, and even given a healthy dose of character.  I like how the Count takes an interest in Batman as a fellow creature of the night.  Sure, it ultimately ends in a typical superhero versus super villain style fight, but at least they did treat the Count with the respect he deserves.I have been critical of The Batman, and still stand by many of my gripes with the series, but that shouldn't impact your enjoyment of this movie.  Yes, the Joker shouldn't look like a monkey, yes Tom Kenny's voice work as the Penguin can be grating at times, and it isn't nearly as strong as the Bruce Timm/Paul Dini helmed series from the 1990s.  But, what The Batman vs. Dracula does give the viewer is the best of what this incarnation of the Dark Knight has to offer. If you, like myself, aren't a fan of The Batman's take on this universe this movie won't change your mind.For what it is I thoroughly enjoyed The Batman vs. Dracula and would recommend it to any fans of the character or animation.  Odds are, even if you're not a fan of The Batman, you'll find yourself thoroughly enjoying this action packed face off.",4,Surprisingly well done animated feature,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,2604,"['am', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'fond', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'Batman', 'just', 'always', 'struck', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'different', 'classic', 'DC', 'Animated', 'Universe', 'incarnation', 'character', 'never', 'knowing', 'be', 'serious', 'silly-', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'sure', 'show', 'produced', 'lots', 'ideas', 'lent', 'merchandising', 'honesty', 'was', 'okay', 'superhero', 'cartoon', 'seldom', 'felt', 'like', 'Batman', 'occasional', 'episode', 'would', 'pop', 'up', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'spirit', 'character', 'most', 'part', 'series', 'came', 'being', 'more', 'style', 'substance.Now', 'Batman', 'straight', 'TV/DVD', 'movie-', 'feature', 'title', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'see', 'taken', 'seriously', 'Silver', 'Age', 'comic', 'Batman', 'versus', 'Dracula', 'actually', 'remarkably', 'well', 'made', 'piece', ""n't"", 'great', 'animated', 'feature', 'levels', 'Batman', 'Mask', 'Phantasm', 'Batman', 'Beyond', 'Return', 'Joker', 'adding', 'Dracula', 'Batman', 'universe', 'really', 'add', 'anything', 'what', 'Batman', 'versus', 'Dracula', 'do', 'successfully', 'focus', 'what', 'animated', 'series', 'shaving', 'off', 'most', 'weaknesses.The', 'movie', 'was', 'course', 'produced', 'solely', 'novelty', 'pitting', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Prince', 'Darkness', 'team', 'give', 'solid', 'action', 'film', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'cheesy', 'Halloween', 'special', 'series', 'Dracula', 'treated', 'serious', 'villain', 'even', 'given', 'healthy', 'dose', 'character', 'how', 'Count', 'interest', 'Batman', 'fellow', 'creature', 'night', 'Sure', 'ultimately', 'typical', 'superhero', 'versus', 'super', 'villain', 'style', 'fight', 'least', 'did', 'treat', 'Count', 'respect', 'have', 'been', 'critical', 'Batman', 'still', 'stand', 'many', 'gripes', 'series', 'should', ""n't"", 'impact', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'Yes', 'Joker', 'should', ""n't"", 'look', 'monkey', 'yes', 'Tom', 'Kenny', 'voice', 'work', 'Penguin', 'can', 'be', 'grating', 'times', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'strong', 'Bruce', 'Timm/Paul', 'Dini', 'helmed', 'series', '1990s', 'what', 'Batman', 'vs.', 'Dracula', 'give', 'viewer', 'best', 'what', 'incarnation', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'offer', 'are', ""n't"", 'fan', 'Batman', 'take', 'universe', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'change', 'mind.For', 'what', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Batman', 'vs.', 'Dracula', 'would', 'recommend', 'fans', 'character', 'animation', 'Odds', 'are', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'Batman', ""'ll"", 'find', 'thoroughly', 'enjoying', 'action', 'packed', 'face', 'off']",The Batman vs Dracula
