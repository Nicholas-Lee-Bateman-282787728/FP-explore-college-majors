1151322,ADLVFFE4VBT8,B0015XHQVC,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[0, 0]","""War, Inc."" belongs to that sparse collection of contemporary war comedy/dramas that insist in telling us the truth the only way a non-indie movie can do - as a comedy if blowing up (Hilary Duff's ""I Want to Blow You Up"" as one of the feature songs) and otherwise killing numerous people can go under humor. Think ofIdiocracy,The Men Who Stare at Goats, the older and significantly more respectfulThree Kings [Blu-ray], the even more respectfulW. [Blu-ray] to some extent. This falling under comedy, the makers faced less pressure for 'balance' and, once the location is set to the fantasy and idyllic land of Turaqistan most inhibitions are off and we can watch the likes of John Cusack, Hilary Duff, Marisa Tomei, Joan Cusack, Dan Aykroyd, Ben Kingsley operate in a space where freedom and democracy are being delivered to a grateful country by means of sustained bombing followed by reconstruction and government-financed private enterprise.I am not going to reveal the plot because most of it can be sourced to news stories by simply changing Turakistan and Ugigistan to some real-world country names. A lot of the comic effect is the process of recognizing 'that scene' as being inspired by 'that real-life event' or 'that actor/character' being the too close for comfort caricature of 'that politician or personality'. It's fun and it's a recommended watch for both those who consider themselves 'well informed' and the occasional viewers/readers of mainstream media productions delivered to us as 'the news'. In the end, the plot as thin and chaotic as any story attempting to portray 'what is' rather than 'what happens' or 'what happened' it's a movie worth watching. I was quite impressed by John Cusack's performance as the assassin with a conscience, Hilary Duff brilliant impersonation of a Middle-East rock star, Joan Cusack as the hysterical and murderous public relations and interrogation expert. It's all done with enthusiasm and talent and it's too bad the movie had such a limited release back in 2008. But that can be partially remedied by watching the movie today and learning and having some fun in the process.I am going to grant this one 4 stars (most professional critics didn't like it at all) because some of the scenes in the middle aren't as brilliantly executed as those at the opening and the end (I'm not talking about the credits) but it's a great and a 'different' movie to watch and you can do it for free before you buy with Amazon's Prime or Netflix.",4,Caricature of a farce,1333929600,"04 9, 2012",2012,2488,"['War', 'Inc.', 'sparse', 'collection', 'contemporary', 'war', 'comedy/dramas', 'insist', 'telling', 'truth', 'only', 'way', 'non-indie', 'movie', 'can', 'do', 'comedy', 'blowing', 'up', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'Want', 'Blow', 'Up', 'one', 'feature', 'songs', 'otherwise', 'killing', 'numerous', 'people', 'can', 'go', 'humor', 'Think', 'ofIdiocracy', 'Men', 'Who', 'Stare', 'Goats', 'older', 'significantly', 'more', 'respectfulThree', 'Kings', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'even', 'more', 'respectfulW', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'extent', 'falling', 'comedy', 'makers', 'faced', 'less', 'pressure', ""'balance"", 'once', 'location', 'set', 'fantasy', 'idyllic', 'land', 'Turaqistan', 'most', 'inhibitions', 'are', 'off', 'can', 'watch', 'likes', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'operate', 'space', 'where', 'freedom', 'democracy', 'are', 'being', 'delivered', 'grateful', 'country', 'means', 'sustained', 'bombing', 'followed', 'reconstruction', 'government-financed', 'private', 'enterprise.I', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'reveal', 'plot', 'most', 'can', 'be', 'sourced', 'news', 'stories', 'simply', 'changing', 'Turakistan', 'Ugigistan', 'real-world', 'country', 'names', 'lot', 'comic', 'effect', 'process', 'recognizing', 'scene', 'being', 'inspired', 'real-life', 'event', 'actor/character', 'being', 'too', 'close', 'comfort', 'caricature', ""'that"", 'politician', 'personality', 'fun', 'recommended', 'watch', 'who', 'consider', ""'well"", 'informed', 'occasional', 'viewers/readers', 'mainstream', 'media', 'productions', 'delivered', 'news', 'end', 'plot', 'thin', 'chaotic', 'story', 'attempting', 'portray', ""'what"", 'rather', ""'what"", ""'what"", 'happened', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'John', 'Cusack', 'performance', 'assassin', 'conscience', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'brilliant', 'impersonation', 'Middle-East', 'rock', 'star', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'hysterical', 'murderous', 'public', 'relations', 'interrogation', 'expert', 'done', 'enthusiasm', 'talent', 'too', 'bad', 'movie', 'had', 'limited', 'release', 'back', '2008', 'can', 'be', 'partially', 'remedied', 'watching', 'movie', 'today', 'learning', 'having', 'fun', 'process.I', 'am', 'going', 'grant', 'one', '4', 'stars', 'most', 'professional', 'critics', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'scenes', 'middle', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'brilliantly', 'executed', 'opening', 'end', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'credits', 'great', ""'different"", 'movie', 'watch', 'can', 'do', 'free', 'buy', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'Netflix']","War, Inc."

If, however, you are intruiged (i.e., confused and stymied) by Bush-era American international relations (or lack thereof), and geopolitical maneuvering, then you may like this show.John Cusack plays a disaffected hit-man who is forced to go to a central Asian country that has been invaded by a corporate army.  The war is billed as the first corporate military invasion in history.  All troops, armor, weapons, etc., are corporate owned AND operated.  Cusack poses as the organizer and promoter of a huge trade show that will take place in ""The Emerald City"" (i.e., Green zone) in the middle of a raging war.

1151335,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B0015XHQVC,D. Hartley,"[6, 10]","In star/producer/co-writer John Cusack's pet project War, Inc., one character delivers a throwaway line that must surely have been the pitch for the film: ""This is like Strangelove in the desert."" Indeed, one senses the ghosts of savage satires past, like Dr. Strangelove, The President's Analyst, Network and Winter Kills in this topical send-up of BushCo and the post-9/11 `murcan zeitgeist. Unfortunately, one also senses a lack of cohesion in an initially smart script that soon loses focus and goes awkwardly tumbling into broad farce, wildly firing its barbs in too many directions at the same time.Cusack's character is Brand Hauser, a hot-sauce chugging hit man with a tortured past who seems to be an amalgam of Jason Bourne, Captain Willard and, um, Chuck Barris. He has been dispatched to ""Turaqistan"" (ahem), a war-torn Middle Eastern hot spot ripe for reconstruction and corporate exploitation. He is there to terminate the country's Oil Minister (Lyubomir Neikov) with extreme prejudice. The minister is a spanner in the works for the corporate machinations of Hauser's employer, a former Vice-President turned CEO (Dan Ackroyd, doing a credible quacking Cheney) who now heads Tamerlane (a cross between Halliburton and Blackwater). The prospect of spearheading the ""first completely out-sourced war"" appears to make the ex-Veep harder than Chinese arithmetic. In order to get close to his target, Hauser poses as the event coordinator of a Tamerlane-sponsored trade fair being held in the capital city's ""green zone"". Hauser's front soon proves to be the tougher gig, as he juggles the demands of three women: his fellow operative posing as his P.A. (Joan Cusack), a tenacious lefty journalist (Marisa Tomei) and a petulant pop diva named Yonica Babyyeah (Hilary Duff). Hilarity ensues.Reportedly, the filmmakers have coyly denied that this is an unofficial sequel to Grosse Pointe Blank, but obvious comparisons abound, particularly in just about every scene that the Cusack siblings share; it feels at the very least to be a nod and a wink to the roles they played in that movie. Admittedly, it is great fun watching those two working together again, but it only serves as a momentary distraction from the film's uneven tone.I think the malady here is similar to that which plagued Lions for Lambs: an overdose of intent.

There are moments when the satire does shine through the sloppiness of the film-maker, but it's a train wreck of a film. If you can suffer through terrible directing and extremely sloppy story-writing, then you may be able to sit through this whole movie. The actors are just fine, and the ideas are fine, but it's a poorly executed mess. That's probably why it was shelved for several years before finally seeing a small theatrical release. And if this is the best job the editors could do with it... then I'd hate to see what the original first several cuts looked like.Going into this movie I really wanted to like it. I loved ""Grosse Point Blank."" (This is supposed to be an unofficial sequel of sorts.) I love the Cusacks' work. I like the concept. I tried very hard to like the film, but had to leave after watching most of it.

But I must say this movie rises above that to a surprising degree and I found myself enjoying it more and more as it went along.  Cusack managed to make his role reasonably believable, and even likeable, and Marisa Tomei as always was perfect.  In fact Marisa Tomei almost single handedly saved this movie for me.  She is probably the most underrated actress in Hollywood.  Even Hilary Duff was surprisingly good, though she still can't sing.  The political satire aspect of the movie was mostly well done and if anything went easy on the good old USA.  I say this because I just finished reading Peter Dale Scott's ""American War Machine,"" which details the decades long collaboration between the CIA and the US Military with the international drug cartels as a means to an end for the powers that be (i.e., Big oil, Wall Street, and the military industrial complex).

And I don't mean the exploding kind, though there are plenty of explosions and firefights and a literal bombing or two.I have enjoyed many John Cusack movies. I thought his recent The Martian Child was very good. The producers were hoping in War Inc. to up the ante on Grosse Pointe Blank, with a higher body count and a higher level of mercenary insanity. Unfortunately lightning rarely strikes twice.There are several reasons the movie fails, and I can't list them all. First, the movie tries too hard to be clever -- it brims over with absurdities that are supposed to be amusing. But the emphasis seems to be on making an over-the-top political statement about USA's military-industrial complex (comparing it to the killer-for-hire business in Grosse Pointe), and the personal conflict of Cusack's character in War Inc seems less integral to the plot. It doesn't reach us on the same personal level, either in the comedy or the romance, that it did in Grosse Pointe.This movie might be very well-received in countries with the lowest opinion of American military power and foreign policy. It might also find a sympathetic audience among those in this country who view our corporations and hawkish politicians as evil killers. But the dialog isn't sharp enough, the skewering doesn't have enough resonance, to make this a great movie, or even a good one.What separates a black comedy like this from a classic like Dr. Strangelove? Sharper writing, better performances, and subtlety. War Inc. is about as subtle as its pop icon Yonica's hip-gyrating ""I want to blow you... UP!"" musical performance.

Other than the fact that Cusack's character plays a corporate assassin whose ability to kill his target is hampered by a love interest, this is nothing like GROSSE POINTE BLANK. WAR, INC. is a very targeted satire against companies like Haliburton and Blackwater and other privatized armed forces that seems to lose its way amongst a mire of sleepy performances, mostly uninteresting dialogue, and a scattered mix of comedy, romance, action and satire that never seems to gel together.Cusack, who co-wrote the film, obviously has his heart in the right place as companies like Blackwater and Haliburton seemed to be on the verge of running the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and they were prime targets for some good satire. Sadly, that satire doesn't present itself other in some very obvious ways. The only performers who seem to be on their game here are the Cusacks (both John and Joan) and, oddly enough, Hilary Duff, who makes a pretty good case as someone to be treated seriously. Kingsley's casting is inspired, but you get the sense that not even he knows what his character's motivations are. Kingsley is one of the world's greatest living actors and after a brilliant and sadly-underrated performance in John Dahl's 2007 hit-man comedy YOU KILL ME, he still remains somewhat obscure.The film's plot becomes increasingly convoluted and the film's climax is very forgettable, but the very end of the film is something I remember keenly, not because it was so effective, but because it was so incredibly bizarre.WAR, INC. is a idea born of good intentions, but sadly doesn't live up to them.",2,"This is NOT a GROSSE POINTE BLANK sequel, nor even in the same vein.",1339286400,"06 10, 2012",2012,1724,"['time', 'see', 'review', 'film', 'comparing', 'George', 'Armitage', 'brilliant', 'GROSSE', 'POINTE', 'BLANK', 'get', 'little', 'angry', 'Other', 'fact', 'Cusack', 'character', 'corporate', 'assassin', 'ability', 'kill', 'target', 'hampered', 'love', 'interest', 'nothing', 'GROSSE', 'POINTE', 'BLANK', 'WAR', 'INC.', 'very', 'targeted', 'satire', 'companies', 'Haliburton', 'Blackwater', 'other', 'privatized', 'armed', 'forces', 'lose', 'way', 'mire', 'sleepy', 'performances', 'mostly', 'uninteresting', 'dialogue', 'scattered', 'mix', 'comedy', 'romance', 'action', 'satire', 'never', 'gel', 'together.Cusack', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'film', 'obviously', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'companies', 'Blackwater', 'Haliburton', 'seemed', 'be', 'verge', 'running', 'wars', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'were', 'prime', 'targets', 'good', 'satire', 'Sadly', 'satire', ""n't"", 'present', 'other', 'very', 'obvious', 'ways', 'only', 'performers', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'game', 'here', 'are', 'Cusacks', 'John', 'Joan', 'oddly', 'enough', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'who', 'pretty', 'good', 'case', 'someone', 'be', 'treated', 'seriously', 'Kingsley', 'casting', 'inspired', 'get', 'sense', 'not', 'even', 'what', 'character', 'motivations', 'are', 'Kingsley', 'one', 'world', 'greatest', 'living', 'actors', 'brilliant', 'sadly-underrated', 'performance', 'John', 'Dahl', '2007', 'hit-man', 'comedy', 'YOU', 'KILL', 'ME', 'still', 'somewhat', 'obscure.The', 'film', 'plot', 'increasingly', 'convoluted', 'film', 'climax', 'very', 'forgettable', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'something', 'remember', 'keenly', 'not', 'was', 'so', 'effective', 'was', 'so', 'incredibly', 'bizarre.WAR', 'INC.', 'idea', 'born', 'good', 'intentions', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'live', 'up']","War, Inc."

1151353,A3THPY89EAVU3M,B0015XHQVC,Jeremy A. Zentner,"[1, 3]","Well, John Cusack is in an other kooky flick that's take place in the not-so-distant future in an imaginary country called Turaqistan, of which has recently been defeated by contracted soldiers in the name of corporate greed. Like a reality trade show, Turaqistan is going to become the star of an international show in which it is rebuilt with the help of Tammerlane sponsorship. The protagonist is sent to the country under the cover of a contractor-producer for the major rebuilding show. But really he's an assassin sent to take out an Omar Sharif, the oil minister who attempts to nationalize certain pipe-lines that have yet to be constructed. This assassin, Hauser, is a bitter man, a lonely man, a man who found his wife murdered and his child kidnapped. Only the continuation of corrupt international corporate warfare will pay his bills.Under his cover job, Hauser mostly chaperoned what was considered the Brittany Spears of Turaqistan. Yonika is a sexually obsessed singer who is future wife of the heir to the Turaqistan throne. Though Hauser is later exposed to her secret obsession with playing acoustic ballads. In English. This is somehow supposed to be more true and native to the woman. I didn't really buy it. Wouldn't she be speaking in her own tongue, using native instruments and styles? Maybe I'm just crazy.There's also a journalist who protested the war and naturally hates Hauser. For some random reason Hauser grows an infatuation with the woman. Her character only serves as a plot-device to get the three characters into an abandoned manor for an interview with the singer, sponsored by Houser. Here, they are attacked by the fianc&eacute;'s entourage who are now shunned by the government for attempting to digitize Yonika's consummation on DVD. Really though, they were used as fodder by Hauser and Sharif so that the heir to the Turaqi throne remains blameless for such a scandal.The entourage was a little ticked.But most end up dead and the hands of Hauser.There are a few more action scenes that involve the journalist's kidnapping and eventual rescue. Hauser confronting his boss in an almost wacky chase scene along with the revelation of Hauser's daughter. Turns out, she's Yonika. What a twist! This was kind of ridiculous since there is almost no evidence in the beginning or middle scenes that give credit to Yonika's American origin. Other than the fact that she doesn't know who her father is. Whoopdi do. Seems a little extravagant for a kidnapper, who turns out to be Hauser's old boss, to raise a random girl in a Mid-Eastern nation to blossom into sexy pop star and marry heir to the Turaqi throne, just to make things weird for Hauser.But I digress.This flick is somewhat witty in an all too frightful satire of American corporate imperialism, but it just doesn't pull off the moral/satirical message that it attempts to convey. The acting and protagonist set-up is so inclined to an older flick that War, Inc. might as well have been called Gross Pointe Blank II: Revenge of Dan Ackroyd. The general plot development seemed so random at times that I wasn't sure if I was watching a movie about victims of a Middle Eastern war or victims of the screenwriter's strike. Then there were the pity scenes. That's right, the scenes given to Joan Cusack because she happens to be related to John Cusack. Again, Joan plays an all too often pissy secretary and over-embellishes everything she says. Cut her off!Likely Page BreakThe overall satire was kind of ironic as well. Obviously it illustrates the growing concern of corporate greed on an international scale and man's obsession with pop culture. But a lot of action scenes are initiated by an entourage of dim-witted Mid-Easterners that must be pulverized by the white anti-hero, Hauser. A little too great white hope symbolism, though I do appreciate the insanity of the American troops out in the battle-field listening to metal as they spray bullets into an already war-torn city. Overall the ratio between exposing the wrongs of American imperialism and fundamentalist terrorism is pretty even.The end of the movie was definitely something left to be desired. It's like they threw a bunch of annoyingly inconsistent characters into one big happy family after the whole daughter situation is discovered. I'm just glad that I saw a missile chase after their plane at the end.

1151357,A10872FHIJAKKD,B0015XHQVC,Just Bill,"[8, 15]","I have a confession to make: John Cusack is one of my all-time favorite actors.Okay. Now you know my bias. Proceed at your own risk.John's latest movie -- the much-hyped, limited-release, and all-but-banned -- War, Inc. is tremendous.But not for the reason you think.I bought the movie the minute it was released. I purposely avoided reading reviews of it (except for skimming its rating and a few sentences about it on Rotten Tomatoes) because I wanted to see it for myself. All I knew going into it was that it was supposed to be (a) a comedy, and (b) a thinly veiled, left-wing satire that skewers 21st century American warmongers.I knew the cast included John, his sister Joan, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Dan Aykroyd, and Ben Kinglsey -- a dream cast if I've ever seen one. I knew John played a hit man with conflicted emotions, a growing conscience that affected his performance. I knew Joan (another of my favorite actors) played his hit-scheduler. Together, John and Joan were (more or less) reprising their roles in another favorite movie of mine: Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), about a hit man who attends his high-school reunion.That was it.Well, almost it. I knew from reading the dozens of rabid fans on his MySpace page that War, Inc. was An Important Movie, a Stick-It-To-The-Republicans film that would surely expose the Bush administration for the turd-pile that it is.I watched it tonight. Apart from the hype, laying aside its flaws (more about that in a minute), forgetting its supposed anti-Bush bias, War, Inc., is a very good movie that offers far more than meets the eye.Here's the story:Brand Hauser (John Cusack) is sent to the fictional country of Turaqistan to kill Omar Sharif, a Middle Eastern oil minister, by the ex-Vice President (Aykroyd) who is now head honcho for a conglomerate called Tamerlane (read: Halliburton). Hauser's cover is to pose as a Tamerlane trade-show producer. On the plane to Turaqistan, Mr. Vice President says to him, ""This is a historic moment, Hauser. The first war ever to be 100 percent outsourced to private enterprise. Tamerlane jets. Tamerlane tanks. Tamerlane soldiers."" Marsha Dillion (Joan) constantly urges Hauser to focus his time and energy on Omar so that they can get the hell out of the country, mission accomplished.That's the premise of the movie. Ostensibly. There's more to this movie than that. So if that's all you expect from War, Inc., you're sure to be disappointed.When Hauser arrives in Turaqistan, he's dumbstruck by the advertisements plastered everywhere. Even a tank rolls by sporting ads from Popeye's, Golden Palace Casino, and FT Financial Times on its side. Turiqistan is one big product placement, all funded by Halib -- I mean, Tamerlane.Hauser meets and falls for a hot ""left-wing"" reporter named Natalie Hegalhuzen (Tomei). He also meets a Britney Spears-like sleazy pop star named Yonica Babyyeah (Duff) who tries to seduce him.The rest of the movie is, essentially, Hauser pursuing Natalie, avoiding Yonica, and tracking Omar. There's a backstory that slowly teases its way into the open about 3/4 of the way through the movie. It seems Walken (Kingsley), a high ranking member of the CIA -- who recruited Hauser to be a hit man for an op code-named ""Operation Chickenhawk"" -- plays a more sinister role...revealed at the end to be even worse than revealed in the backstory.A few key/interesting scenes:1. The Implanted Journalist Experience -- in which journalists are implanted with a chip, given goggles and ear buds and seated in a Disney-like thrill ride as they watch movies of the war. ""We are now able to reduce the risk of journalist mortality to virtually zero. The Combat O' Rama implantation device will allow you to experience full-spectrum sensory reality...thanks and enjoy your ride."" Surreal.2. While Hauser sits in his Humvee putting Omar in his cross hairs, a hopped-up tank full of American soldiers careens around a corner, shooting at everything in sight. One soldier approaches the Humvee carrying his dry cleaning. The solider eats a packet of dried coffee grounds, beats his head against the Humvee and acts like he's drunk on the sheer joy of killing. (I'll get back to this in a minute.)3. Natalie dancing with Omar. Marisa is a hottie and I enjoy watching her move.4. Yonica putting a live scorpion in her pants, then asking one of her handlers to reach in and get it while Hauser watches in disbelief. Yonica is also a hottie, albeit a sluttier-than-thou one. I enjoy watching her move, too.5. Hauser walking in on Yonica in her hotel room as she's singing a pretty song while strumming an acoustic guitar. If this movie had metaphorical overtones, this scene would be chief among them. It is the meeting of two people who are hollow inside, both struggling to come to grips with the worlds they've created for themselves. Whereas some would say this scene slows the pace of the movie, I say this scene is the movie. (I'll get back to this in a minute.)6. A line uttered by Hauser to Walken, the CIA man (Kingsley): ""Whoever momentarily interrupts the accumulation of wealth we pulverize. I'm just not feeling good about that any more, Sir.""7. Natalie, Yonica, and Hauser sipping wine (Yonica hates wine and requested milk) in an abandoned mansion. They get to talking, and ask Hauser if he's ever been married. This is where Hauser reveals his backstory: ""I came home one night and my beautiful wife had been slaughtered."" Plus, his daughter is taken, without a ransom note. So, in one fell swoop Hauser loses his entire family. It's enough to drive anyone to be a hit man. (More about that in a moment.)8. Hauser and Natalie running for their lives through a No-Go zone, hugging corners of bombed-out buildings, dashing in and around abandoned cars, diving for cover behind piles of dirt. Suddenly, a chopper appears in the night, hovers over the building, and sets machine guns blazing -- on the crowd of unarmed civilians emerging from the darkness. (I'll get back to this in a minute.)9. Kinglsey's character telling Hauser: ""War is the improvement of investment climates by other means...The USA is a subdivision of Tamerlane. Democracy, the war on terror, the war on drugs: these are all focus-group slogans for Tamerlane."" Again, this is supposed to be part of the movie's foundational premise. Tamerlane/Halliburton starts wars, then supplies wars with products to conduct the war, and even the products afterwards with which to rebuild the countries it destroys.After a surprise I didn't see coming, the movie ends with everyone getting his/her due. Roll credits. And that's that.Or is it? Let me see if I can explain what I think War, Inc., is really about.First, this isn't the blatant anti-war movie everyone -- including its creator John Cusack -- would like you to believe. Scenes of advertisement-torn Turaqistan, the ubiquitousness of Tamerlane, and the mercenary-like ex Vice President are few and far between. They, perhaps, comprise 35% of the movie. Maybe less. Sure, the movie is set in Turaqistan. Bombs and gun fire are heard occasionally. And you never forget that Tamerlane surrounds you.But I think War, Inc., is a movie about emptiness and what people do to fill it. Consider:* Hauser is empty, emotionless. He's a hit man.* Yonica is empty, emotionless. She's a slut posing as a pop star.* The ex Vice President is empty, heartless. He's a sociopath mercenary.* The soldiers are empty, without conscience. They kill at will, anyone and anything.* The people of Turaqistan are empty, without a country. They're surrounded by death on one side, and Popeye's on the other.* Marsha is empty, a fellow mercenary, killing for business.* Tamerlane is empty, a soulless company that lives for capitalism at all cost.* I would even argue that Natalie, the ""left-wing"" journalist, is empty, too. She relies on causes to give her life meaning.War, Inc., therefore, is not an anti-war movie. It is also not really a comedy, although it is billed as such. There are a couple of laughs in the movie. But, mostly, it's a movie about people struggling to find meaning in an insane world -- either the world of their own making, or the world thrust upon them.I realized that when I watched the scene of Hauser and Yonica in the hotel room. It was a touching scene, one that -- if you're watching for it -- revealed the movie's core.If you view War, Inc., as a rollicking good kick in the pants of Republicans, if you think it's a blistering satire about modern-day war making, you'll be disappointed. Or, even if you like it, you'll miss the movie's deeper meaning.War, Inc., is a metaphor for life lived without meaning and to what lengths people go to fill the void. Seen through that prism, War, Inc. becomes a movie that serves as a warning to all of us -- Republicans, Democrats, Liberals, Conservatives, rich, poor, black, white, male, female...whatever. Meaningless is meaningless. It can happen to all of us. Any one of us fights to keep from falling into the emptiness. At any moment we could be Yonica. Or Hauser. Or the head of a Halliburton-like conglomerate that feeds the war machine -- and reaps profit from it. This movie has less to do with Republicans than it does with people who ceased being human. And I know many from both parties who fall in to that category.The last thing I'll say about War, Inc., is that the scenes of rampaging American soldiers were ham-fisted, which is to say inaccurate and unnecessary to the plot. They were a slap in the face of the thousands of men and women who serve with honor and dignity, who sincerely believe they're helping the Iraqi people. Those scenes in War, Inc. dishonor them and threaten to reduce the movie to left-wing propaganda.Which is a shame. For War, Inc., is a very well made, multi-layered movie about the human condition that just so happens to be a thinly veiled jab at Halliburton and our propensity to make a buck where no buck should be made.Those two messages combined -- the emptiness of life and what people do to fill the void, plus the repulsive, highly questionable act of privatizing war -- pack a powerful punch. But I think one has to take both aspects into account for the movie to deliver the knockout its creators seek.",5,"JOHN CUSACK'S WAR, INC.

In this particular case, it is the fictional nation of Turaqistan, which the U.S. has recently invaded and where it is now contracting out all its security and reconstruction services to a private corporation called Tamerlane, modeled, none too subtly, on Halliburton and KBR.John Cusack stars as Brand Hauser, a covert operator working under the auspices of the former vice-president of the United States (Dan Akroyd), whose mission is to take out the CEO of an oil company at a gala wedding reception that Brand himself is supposed to organize. While in the ""safe zone"" - known in common parlance as the Emerald City - Brand meets his high-strung assistant (played by Cusack's real-life sister Joan), the promiscuous celebrity bride (the typecast Hilary Duff), a fellow hit man (Ben Kingsley) who has some personal issues with Brand, and Natalie Hegalhuzen (Marisa Tomei), a liberal reporter from the Nation, who is there to expose the multinational skullduggery and corruption taking place in the country - or as she affectionately calls it ""a democracy on the march land-grab.""Written by Cusack, Mark Leyner and Jeremy Pikser and directed by Joshua Seftel, ""War, Inc."" is a largely hit-and-miss affair, with moments of insight and humor alternating with moments of silliness and juvenalia.

It is a sppof and has a spoof feel, and some of the movie really is funny. Conversations held with your navigation device to discuss your problems is a good example of that, because some of the things that it says are truly funny material. Other things also rear their heads and get good laughs as well, and the first half of the movie would have been a five-star beast if it would have kept up its pace. It didn't do that, though, and instead became convoluted and a bit on the boring side. By the end of the movie I was just ready for the thing to end, and i really didn't expect that. I say that because of the main person involved is someone i like, and he had his hands in the project fromt he beginning. Still, it does have some moments in it and they are really good moments, so I didn't find myself totally hating the movie.One of the things I did dislike was the way Hilary Duff's character was portrayed. This isn't meant as a knock on her acting skills, but is instead meant to address the issues of the character itself. She goes from an accented star to a person with hidden feelings that sounds like Duff, and that didn't play out well. Neither did the forced love connection that enters the fray, or the overall connection between the past and the present. Looking at the scenes that some of this happens in makes me think that they should have been funny and, if executed properly, they would have been great. They were not played out well, however, and the mixture of many things makes the over-the-top violene seem like it wants to be something like Shoot-em-up but without all the wonderful little things that made that movie funny.One pro in the movie was the acting of John C., however, but I expected that. I liked what he did with his character and i liked the subtle things that came out when he interacted with other people. I even bought into his killer instincts when they were displayed, and how they made him look like a man that was an artist when it came to killing. As I said before, i simply could not find my footing in the storyline and it diminished the character's capacity to make me laugh, ruining some rather good moments. If John C. was less talented at taking roles and bending them to his will, i would have found the movie even less desirable than I did.Some people do like this movie a lot and i respect that, too. I want people to know that as well, thinking they should perhaps read why they thought the movie was a good one and measure those pros and cons. As i pointed out in my review, I liked the start of this beast and I thought that it had quite a few moments that really took the proverbial cake. I just couldn't eat a whole slice because it seemed undercooked and, as everyone knows, uncooing things can poison even the most healthy of persons.Not my cup of tea - or hot sauce, if you prefer.",3,"Strong start, strong characters, but riddled with comedic holes.",1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,3046,"['Outsourcing', 'wars', 'killing', 'people', 'want', 'kill', 'using', 'charity', 'cover', 'teaching', 'how', 'hot', 'sauce', 'can', 'become', 'tool', 'trade', 'are', 'things', 'movie', 'table', 'sppof', 'spoof', 'feel', 'movie', 'really', 'funny', 'Conversations', 'held', 'navigation', 'device', 'discuss', 'problems', 'good', 'example', 'things', 'are', 'truly', 'funny', 'material', 'Other', 'things', 'also', 'rear', 'heads', 'get', 'good', 'laughs', 'well', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'five-star', 'beast', 'would', 'have', 'kept', 'up', 'pace', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'though', 'instead', 'became', 'convoluted', 'bit', 'boring', 'side', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'ready', 'thing', 'end', 'i', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'say', 'main', 'person', 'involved', 'someone', 'i', 'had', 'hands', 'project', 'fromt', 'beginning', 'Still', 'have', 'moments', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'moments', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'totally', 'hating', 'movie.One', 'things', 'did', 'dislike', 'was', 'way', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'character', 'was', 'portrayed', ""n't"", 'meant', 'knock', 'acting', 'skills', 'instead', 'meant', 'address', 'issues', 'character', 'accented', 'star', 'person', 'hidden', 'feelings', 'Duff', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'out', 'well', 'did', 'forced', 'love', 'connection', 'fray', 'overall', 'connection', 'past', 'present', 'Looking', 'scenes', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'executed', 'properly', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'were', 'not', 'played', 'out', 'well', 'however', 'mixture', 'many', 'things', 'over-the-top', 'violene', 'seem', 'be', 'something', 'Shoot-em-up', 'wonderful', 'little', 'things', 'made', 'movie', 'funny.One', 'pro', 'movie', 'was', 'acting', 'John', 'C.', 'however', 'expected', 'liked', 'what', 'did', 'character', 'i', 'liked', 'subtle', 'things', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'interacted', 'other', 'people', 'even', 'bought', 'killer', 'instincts', 'when', 'were', 'displayed', 'how', 'made', 'look', 'man', 'was', 'artist', 'when', 'came', 'killing', 'said', 'i', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'footing', 'storyline', 'diminished', 'character', 'capacity', 'make', 'ruining', 'rather', 'good', 'moments', 'John', 'C.', 'was', 'less', 'talented', 'taking', 'roles', 'bending', 'will', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'movie', 'even', 'less', 'desirable', 'did.Some', 'people', 'do', 'movie', 'lot', 'i', 'respect', 'too', 'want', 'people', 'know', 'as', 'well', 'thinking', 'should', 'perhaps', 'read', 'why', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'measure', 'pros', 'cons', 'i', 'pointed', 'out', 'review', 'liked', 'start', 'beast', 'thought', 'had', 'quite', 'few', 'moments', 'really', 'took', 'proverbial', 'cake', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'eat', 'whole', 'slice', 'seemed', 'undercooked', 'everyone', 'uncooing', 'things', 'can', 'poison', 'even', 'most', 'healthy', 'persons.Not', 'cup', 'tea', 'hot', 'sauce', 'prefer']","War, Inc."

In fact, because it is so cheesy, it ends up doing its feeble best to discredit criticism of war-profiteering, political manipulations and the general ineptness of post-invasion Iraq occupation.I wonder how people reading the script could possibly miss the thick layer of stupidity that so effectively negates its satire.",1,"Big budget, great actors, potentially incendiary subject, surprisingly inept script.",1230163200,"12 25, 2008",2008,988,"['certainly', 'hope', 'video', 'store', ""n't"", 'double-charge', 'took', '6', 'days', 'several', 'sittings', 'finish', 'comedy', 'angle', 'certainly', 'stale', 'general', 'endpoint', 'plot', 'becomes', 'clear', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'cinematographic', 'soundtrack', 'DNA', 'derivative', 'clone', 'better', 'films', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'one', 'scene', 'setup', 'music', 'was', 'clearly', 'calling', 'Boots', 'Are', 'Made', 'Walking', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove.The', 'issues', 'so', 'clumsily', 'attempts', 'address', 'deserve', 'better', 'airing', 'Yup', 'got', 'many', 'references', 'real', 'events', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'dense', 'not', 'not', 'subtle', 'movie', 'nope', 'still', 'lame', 'fact', 'so', 'cheesy', 'up', 'doing', 'feeble', 'best', 'discredit', 'criticism', 'war-profiteering', 'political', 'manipulations', 'general', 'ineptness', 'post-invasion', 'Iraq', 'wonder', 'how', 'people', 'reading', 'script', 'could', 'possibly', 'miss', 'thick', 'layer', 'stupidity', 'so', 'effectively', 'satire']","War, Inc."

That cast simply won't let a movie be bad. They couldn't if they tried.Despite an apparent attempt to be ordinary entertainment, this one rises above all the usual categories. Do you want a cynical mockumentary of Haliburton-style war profiteering? Got it. Do you want pointed jabs at operations funded by Congress's ""black budget?"" Check. Do you want satirical assaults on simplistic sloganeering from every possible direction? It's there. Add in a babe like a pre-meltdown Britney but with hotter hotpants and a bucket of slapstick, and you're headed in the right direction. For example, a major character's name is ""Uckmee Fay."" Speakers of pig-Latin, please take note.They set the tone from the very first scene. Chevy Chase delivers a ""Mission Impossible"" style of assignment to a high-class assassin, via video, while seated on American Standard's finest. Later, Joan Cusack shows up in the role that she has perfected - the prim, cheery, and murderous psychopath. There's a lot more, too. I laughed all through, even (maybe especially) when I knew that outrage would have been the ""appropriate"" response.This one really grows on me the more I think about it. It doesn't whap you upside the head with humor, politics, or even its sappy moments. Instead, it tickles you with not-quite-too-much of social commentary, current events, goofy jokes, visual gags, and enough more to hold it all together. I liked it more a few hours later than when I walked out the door, and lots of movies have the opposite effect on me.-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical releasePS: See it some time soon.
