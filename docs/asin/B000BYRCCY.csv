My four year old loves dinosaurs and he loves Diego. When he saw this tape for Christmas it made his day. The seller had this tape to me in no time and I can say I have really gotten what I paid for.,5,The Great Dinosaur Rescue,1265414400,"02 6, 2010",2010,291,"['looked', 'local', 'stores', 'tape', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'reasonable', 'price', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'dinosaurs', 'Diego', 'When', 'saw', 'tape', 'Christmas', 'made', 'day', 'seller', 'had', 'tape', 'time', 'can', 'say', 'have', 'really', 'gotten', 'what', 'paid']",Go Diego Go! - The Great Dinosaur Rescue

The bonus episodes are comparable to the ones on TV, but my children also found something not quite right about the Great Dinosaur Rescue.  My son struggled with how they could jump into a book and see animals that are extinct... time on this scale is a difficult concept for toddlers and preschoolers, and mine both found this confusing.I try to watch the DVD's with my kids, and this one I couldn't make it through... singing, dancing, cuddly, eye-lash batting dinosaurs were more than I could watch, at least for this long.  The way that Diego and Alicia interact with the kids is also a little strained compared to Dora episodes.The regular length episodes were fine and my kids love them. Very catchy songs and the kids love learning about the animals.  The bonus poster is great too.
