It really had a lot of potential, and the story was basically good, but the way the movie was put together was terrible.  I kept waiting for something memorable to happen, but it just never did.  This movie was sort of like watching the pilot of a new TV series -- you know, where the viewer is just getting some background information about what's going on, and where the characters don't seem quite comfortable with one another yet.  The film tried to be artsy but fell way short.  The mention of Sundance and Cannes on the box caught my interest, but I should have remembered that those highbrow endorsements mean absolutely nothing to the average filmgoer like me, who is just looking for entertainment.  This movie was not entertaining in the least.",1,"Boring, Boring, Boring !!!",1166400000,"12 18, 2006",2006,799,"['love', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'hated', 'film', 'really', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'story', 'was', 'basically', 'good', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'was', 'terrible', 'kept', 'waiting', 'something', 'memorable', 'happen', 'just', 'never', 'did', 'movie', 'was', 'sort', 'watching', 'pilot', 'new', 'TV', 'series', 'know', 'where', 'viewer', 'just', 'getting', 'background', 'information', 'what', 'going', 'where', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'comfortable', 'one', 'yet', 'film', 'tried', 'be', 'artsy', 'fell', 'way', 'short', 'mention', 'Sundance', 'Cannes', 'box', 'caught', 'interest', 'should', 'have', 'remembered', 'highbrow', 'endorsements', 'mean', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'average', 'filmgoer', 'who', 'just', 'looking', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'entertaining', 'least']",N/A
996534,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000FUTVP0,A Customer,"[6, 7]","Don't Come Knocking is such a visually beautiful film and it's also superbly acted by Sam Shepard and the formidable Jessica Lange - complete with plastic surgery - but dramatically the film is rather inert and ultimately suffers from a sort of portentous and stodgy directorial style, which hampers what could have been a very fine film.Directed by Wim Wenders, Don't Come Knocking is Largely set in Montana, and the scenery is absolutely stunning. Often occupying more than half the screen, the sky is like a character in the movie, which has a bright, distinct and totally vibrant look and ends up being the most interesting character in the film.The movie stars Sam Shepard as a washed-up aging movie star Howard Spence. We first meet him just as he's disappeared from the set of a western in which he is starring. A 60-year-old drug- and alcohol-abusing playboy, Howard heads for home in Elko, Nev., a place he hasn't been in 30 years. We aren't quite sure why he's going there, we can only assume that he's having some kind of mid-life crisis.Of course, the film is left in turmoil, but Howard doesn't care, he's like a little boy who is off exploring and he's oblivious to the chaos that he's causing. A no-nonsense representative of the bond company who is insuring the movie Sutter (Tim Roth) swoops in by helicopter and begins tracking the badly behaved cowboy.While in Elko, Howard's reunion with his elderly mother (Eva Marie Saint) is cut short by the revelation that he has a twenty something son from a one night stand on a film shoot in Butte, Montana, so off Howard goes, to reconnect with his past.  Meanwhile, a young woman named Sky (Sarah Polley) arrives in Butte carrying an urn with her recently deceased mother's ashes. Howard and Sky intersect at the restaurant run by Howard's old flame, Doreen (Jessica Lange) who is rather amused that Howard has turned up after all these years.At a nightclub he points out his son (Gabriel Mann), who has turned into a sort of moody musician Goth, and he's is not eager to embrace his new-found father.  By far the most interesting person in the film is Doreen and kudos must go to Lange - who I still think is America's greatest living screen actress - as she brings Doreen's mixture of wistfulness and naughty giggling to life.Don't Come Knocking suffers from being a bit in love with itself. True, the visual impact of the film is unarguable and the deserted streets of Butte look both stunning and haunted - nicely rendered by cinematographer Franz Lustig - deeply reflecting Wenders' own penchant for an American West etched with loneliness.But the movie trundles along, almost grinding to a halt in the second act where it becomes mired in the mud of disconcerted family business, and the resolution is quite predicable. It's as though the story is desperately trying to work up enough momentum to go somewhere, but the film just never seems to budge.Still, it's refreshing to see the talented Sam Shepard acting again - and playing a leading man, even though the character is a bit of a selfish oaf. And it's also a treat to see him acting with Lange, his wife. For Howard, life as a movie star has been one of irresponsibility and fun; fatherhood has been a mystery and when he confronts its reality, he is just as dumbstruck as he ever was.It's far easier for the western loner to skip town and never look back, and Shepard does a fine job of bringing this almost childlike man to life with all his dysfunctions and insecurities, just an ordinary American man just yearning to connect. It's just a pity that Wenders couldn't find a way to tell Howard's story a bit more lucidly and with less pretentiousness.

996536,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000FUTVP0,Alex Udvary,"[9, 10]","""Don't Come Knocking"" was something of an unexpected treat for me. I remember when the film opened in Chicago, and the awful reviews it got and the lack of public support, but I wanted to see it anyway. And before you knew it, it was out of theatres.It's been a strage year for movies. I've found many times I'm on the outside of public opinion. I actually liked ""All the King's Men"" and I even liked ""The Black Dahlia"". I'm just not influenced by public opinion. I like what I like and the masses aren't going to change my mind.""Don't Come Knocking"" is the kind of film I love to watch. It's a self-discovery road picture. Going back to Ingmar Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries"", ""The Browning Version"" and even the more recent ""About Schmidt"" these kinds of films appeal to me.The reason is because I find the topic universal. We all have regrets in our lives. We all wish at times that we can go back in time and rectify past situations. Now with some wisdom on our side perhaps we would respond to problems differently.In ""Don't Come Knocking"" Howard Spence (Sam Shepard) is going through such a moment in his life. He was once a famous actor in westerns who is now a washed up has-been who gets by on memories of the past.While on the set of his lastest film, a truly corny cliche western film, where characters kiss and then ride off into the sunset (!), Howard decides to pick up and leave. He sneaks off the set and makes his way back home.Howard decides to go visit his mother (Eva Marie Saint) whom he hasn't seen for thirty years. It is there he learns he has a child. From who he doesn't know. How old the child is, he also doesn't know. His mother just casually blurted it out.So from one family reunion to another Howard sets out to find the family he never knew about.It turns out the woman was Doreen (Jessica Lange) and they had a son, Earl (Gabriel Mann). But there's also a stranger (Sarah Polley) who has come to town to find a resting place for her mother's ashes.The film was directed by Wim Wenders and written by Sam Shepard. The two worked together on ""Paris, Texas"" and many see this film as a sequel. Because of that, most critics damned the movie because it wasn't ""Paris, Texas"".I'm actually not very familar with Wenders' work. I've only seen  ""The End of Violence"", ""Buena Vista Social Club"" and ""Beyond the Clouds"" (he co-directed the film with the great Antonioni). Wenders though is probably best known for the film ""Wings of Desire"" with was remade as ""City of Angels"" with Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan.But perhaps my youth and inexperience in Wenders work is what saved me. I can't compare the film to his others. I didn't walk in with high expectations. I let the story move at its own pace and carry me along. Because of this the film managed to catch me off guard and really speak to me. It's one of the best films of 2006 and no one saw it.Bottom-line: This Wim Wenders film is one of the best of the year! A wonderful journey look at how if we are given a second chance in life we can correct our mistakes.",4,"Keep On  ""Knocking""",1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,3039,"['Do', ""n't"", 'Come', 'Knocking', 'was', 'something', 'unexpected', 'treat', 'remember', 'when', 'film', 'opened', 'Chicago', 'awful', 'reviews', 'got', 'lack', 'public', 'support', 'wanted', 'see', 'anyway', 'knew', 'was', 'theatres.It', 'been', 'strage', 'year', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'found', 'many', 'times', ""'m"", 'outside', 'public', 'opinion', 'actually', 'liked', 'King', 'Men', 'even', 'liked', 'Black', 'Dahlia', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'influenced', 'public', 'opinion', 'what', 'like', 'masses', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'change', 'mind', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Come', 'Knocking', 'kind', 'film', 'love', 'watch', 'self-discovery', 'road', 'picture', 'Going', 'back', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Wild', 'Strawberries', 'Browning', 'Version', 'even', 'more', 'recent', 'Schmidt', 'kinds', 'films', 'appeal', 'me.The', 'reason', 'find', 'topic', 'universal', 'have', 'regrets', 'lives', 'wish', 'times', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'rectify', 'past', 'situations', 'Now', 'wisdom', 'side', 'perhaps', 'would', 'respond', 'problems', 'differently.In', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Come', 'Knocking', 'Howard', 'Spence', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'going', 'moment', 'life', 'was', 'once', 'famous', 'actor', 'westerns', 'who', 'now', 'washed', 'has-been', 'who', 'memories', 'past.While', 'set', 'lastest', 'film', 'truly', 'corny', 'cliche', 'western', 'film', 'where', 'characters', 'kiss', 'then', 'ride', 'off', 'sunset', 'Howard', 'pick', 'up', 'leave', 'set', 'way', 'back', 'home.Howard', 'go', 'visit', 'mother', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'whom', ""n't"", 'seen', 'thirty', 'years', 'there', 'child', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'How', 'old', 'child', 'also', ""n't"", 'know', 'mother', 'just', 'casually', 'blurted', 'one', 'family', 'reunion', 'Howard', 'out', 'find', 'family', 'never', 'knew', 'about.It', 'out', 'woman', 'was', 'Doreen', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'had', 'son', 'Earl', 'Gabriel', 'Mann', 'also', 'stranger', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'who', 'come', 'town', 'find', 'resting', 'place', 'mother', 'ashes.The', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Wim', 'Wenders', 'written', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'two', 'worked', 'together', 'Paris', 'Texas', 'many', 'see', 'film', 'sequel', 'most', 'critics', 'damned', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'Paris', 'Texas', '.I', ""'m"", 'actually', 'not', 'very', 'familar', 'Wenders', 'work', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'End', 'Violence', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'Social', 'Club', 'Clouds', 'co-directed', 'film', 'great', 'Antonioni', 'Wenders', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'film', 'Wings', 'Desire', 'was', 'remade', 'City', 'Angels', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Meg', 'Ryan.But', 'perhaps', 'youth', 'inexperience', 'Wenders', 'work', 'what', 'saved', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'film', 'others', 'did', ""n't"", 'walk', 'high', 'expectations', 'let', 'story', 'move', 'own', 'pace', 'carry', 'along', 'film', 'managed', 'catch', 'off', 'guard', 'really', 'speak', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2006', 'one', 'saw', 'it.Bottom-line', 'Wim', 'Wenders', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'year', 'wonderful', 'journey', 'look', 'how', 'are', 'given', 'second', 'chance', 'life', 'can', 'correct', 'mistakes']",N/A
996537,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000FUTVP0,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[18, 20]","Combining two renaissance men like Sam Shepard (THE RIGHT STUFF, 1983) and Wim Wenders (director of PARIS, TEXAS which also starred Shepard) could seem like a golden film opportunity. I'd heard quite a bit of buzz about DON'T COME KNOCKING before its release and was pretty excited to finally sit down and watch it.The story is about Howard Spence (Shepard), a cowboy movie star who's approaching the downside of his aging career. At 60, Howard still lives the life of a starling; he drinks, drugs and sexes himself into oblivion nightly. But (for unknown reasons) he has a bad night on the set of a lame film and decides to flee the production in hopes of finding what lay for him beyond the camera. His history is as scattered as his drug-induced years of debauchery and Howard quickly discovers that he has children in the world. Two children. He visits his mother (Eva Marie Sant, NORTH BY NORTHWEST) in Elko, Nevada and she tells him of a woman who'd called years before claiming to be the mother of his son. At first Howard doesn't believe it, but recollections filter in and he goes in search of his kids. But he also has to evade a bounty hunter named Sutter (Tim Roth, PULP FICTION) who was hired by the film studio to get Howard back to the movie he'd abandoned.Both of Howard's kids' are now adults living lives of their own. We're first introduced to Sky (Sarah Polley, DAWN OF THE DEAD, 2004) who just cremated her mother. She's a withdrawn and quiet woman who easily picks up on who her father is when she sees him lurking around Butte, Montana. The second adult kid is Earl (Gabriel Mann, THE BOURNE IDENTITY), a modern blues singer with a chip the size of a boulder resting on him. His mother, Doreen (Jessica Lange, ROB ROY), tries to ease the news of his father's arrival but is too late. Twenty years of fatherlessness flares, and Howard and he nearly come to blows.As Howard tries to understand life (his own) he constantly gets knocked around. Those who carry his bloodline want nothing to do with him, indicating to Howard that he should simply return to the film set. When the bounty hunter catches up with him, it's little surprise that Howard puts up no resistance.An alternate title for the film might've been ""You Can Never Come Home"" because that is its basic message. Although we're not privy to Howard's thoughts, we can assume that since he's coming to the end of his acting career and his life, he's looking for something meaningful to justify his existence. Of course, children are the ultimate justification, but when they reject you, what's left?The color schemes and filming are visually stunning, but certain scene-to-scene edits were herky-jerky and some embittered relationships felt forced (most notably that of Howard and his son, Earl). Jessica Lange was flawless, though. She's such a fantastic actress. Sam Shepard did an ""okay"" job with an interesting script but I felt little (if any) emotional weight from his character.A big problem with the film was that, on one definitive level, it's a Hollywood flick about Hollywood people. The self-importance of actors and actresses has never appealed to me and this might bother quite a few viewers. But tying it in with those of a shattered family dynamic made the movie easier to swallow.Still, this is an interesting indie film that surpasses some of the trite junk currently gracing the silver screen.",3,YOU CAN NEVER COME HOME,1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,3394,"['Combining', 'two', 'renaissance', 'men', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'THE', 'RIGHT', 'STUFF', '1983', 'Wim', 'Wenders', 'director', 'PARIS', 'TEXAS', 'also', 'starred', 'Shepard', 'could', 'seem', 'golden', 'film', 'opportunity', ""'d"", 'heard', 'quite', 'bit', 'buzz', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'COME', 'KNOCKING', 'release', 'was', 'pretty', 'excited', 'finally', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'it.The', 'story', 'Howard', 'Spence', 'Shepard', 'cowboy', 'movie', 'star', 'who', 'approaching', 'downside', 'aging', 'career', '60', 'Howard', 'still', 'life', 'starling', 'drugs', 'sexes', 'oblivion', 'nightly', 'unknown', 'reasons', 'bad', 'night', 'set', 'lame', 'film', 'decides', 'flee', 'production', 'hopes', 'finding', 'what', 'lay', 'camera', 'history', 'as', 'scattered', 'drug-induced', 'years', 'debauchery', 'Howard', 'quickly', 'children', 'world', 'Two', 'children', 'mother', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Sant', 'NORTH', 'BY', 'NORTHWEST', 'Elko', 'Nevada', 'woman', 'who', ""'d"", 'called', 'years', 'claiming', 'be', 'mother', 'son', 'first', 'Howard', ""n't"", 'believe', 'recollections', 'filter', 'search', 'kids', 'also', 'evade', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'named', 'Sutter', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'PULP', 'FICTION', 'who', 'was', 'hired', 'film', 'studio', 'get', 'Howard', 'back', 'movie', ""'d"", 'abandoned.Both', 'Howard', 'kids', 'are', 'now', 'living', 'lives', 'own', ""'re"", 'first', 'introduced', 'Sky', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'DAWN', 'THE', 'DEAD', '2004', 'who', 'just', 'cremated', 'mother', 'withdrawn', 'quiet', 'woman', 'who', 'easily', 'up', 'who', 'father', 'when', 'lurking', 'Butte', 'Montana', 'second', 'adult', 'kid', 'Earl', 'Gabriel', 'Mann', 'THE', 'BOURNE', 'IDENTITY', 'modern', 'blues', 'singer', 'chip', 'size', 'boulder', 'resting', 'mother', 'Doreen', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'ROB', 'ROY', 'ease', 'news', 'father', 'arrival', 'too', 'late', 'Twenty', 'years', 'fatherlessness', 'flares', 'Howard', 'nearly', 'come', 'blows.As', 'Howard', 'tries', 'understand', 'life', 'own', 'constantly', 'knocked', 'who', 'carry', 'bloodline', 'want', 'nothing', 'do', 'indicating', 'Howard', 'should', 'simply', 'return', 'film', 'set', 'When', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'up', 'little', 'surprise', 'Howard', 'up', 'resistance.An', 'alternate', 'title', 'film', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Can', 'Never', 'Come', 'Home', 'basic', 'message', ""'re"", 'not', 'privy', 'Howard', 'thoughts', 'can', 'assume', 'coming', 'end', 'acting', 'career', 'life', 'looking', 'something', 'meaningful', 'justify', 'existence', 'course', 'children', 'are', 'ultimate', 'justification', 'when', 'reject', 'what', 'left', 'color', 'schemes', 'filming', 'are', 'visually', 'stunning', 'certain', 'scene-to-scene', 'edits', 'were', 'herky-jerky', 'embittered', 'relationships', 'felt', 'forced', 'most', 'notably', 'Howard', 'son', 'Earl', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'was', 'flawless', 'though', 'such', 'fantastic', 'actress', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'did', 'okay', 'job', 'interesting', 'script', 'felt', 'little', 'emotional', 'weight', 'character.A', 'big', 'problem', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'definitive', 'level', 'Hollywood', 'flick', 'Hollywood', 'people', 'self-importance', 'actors', 'actresses', 'never', 'appealed', 'might', 'bother', 'quite', 'few', 'viewers', 'tying', 'shattered', 'family', 'dynamic', 'made', 'movie', 'easier', 'swallow.Still', 'interesting', 'indie', 'film', 'trite', 'junk', 'currently', 'gracing', 'silver', 'screen']",N/A

Not up to the level of Paris, Texas, or Fool for Love, but it was fun to watch. There were a few moments where it seemed a little bit clich&eacute;, like when Howard Spence's son Earl was trashing his apartment and bashing his guitar, throwing it out the window. Then Howard came by and was sitting on the couch out in the street. Kind of a good image but just not believable.Sam Shepard was playing Howard Spence, a washed up actor who walks off the set of his film, a Western. Tim Roth plays an enforcer for the insurance company assigned to bring him back and make him finish it. His son Earl is played by Gabriel Mann, and Jessica Lange plays Earl's mother. It was a little hard to buy that Howard Spence was that important to the success of the film to be insured for 32 million. Last time I looked they weren't making many Westerns anymore as they didn't seem to pay off at the box office. But if we suspend our disbelief, the film wasn't that bad.The scenery, red rock canyon country and desert country in Utah and Montana was spectacular. The music, by T-Bone Burnett, was also spectacular. Gabriel Mann sings some of the songs, and he comes off as a credible singer and musician. Of course, when he trashes his apartment, it is kind of a rock star clich&eacute;, but up until then he had me. Jessica Lange was pretty good, too. Tim Roth turns in a pretty good performance as an unsympathetic corporate bounty hunter. The young lady who played Howard's daughter Sky was pretty good, too. Her name was Sarah Polley. Whereas Gabriel's Earl was all unarticulated rage, and Sam Shepard's Howard was regret and dissipation, Sky wanted to be connected, wanted to be related.I will give this film 4 out of 5 stars, but I can also see why the critics would pile on.

996543,A1Q1PP3Z4QDUQM,B000FUTVP0,Farffleblex Plaffington,"[4, 6]","Writer/actor Sam Shepard plays Howard Spence, an aging, out of fashion and out of control Hollywood star who finally begins to come to terms with life in this well written, wonderfully acted, beautifully shot, marvelously scored, sad and poignant film.Howard stars primarily in Westerns, and as Don't Come Knocking begins, he's on location in Southeastern Utah.  Or rather, he's supposed to be on location.  No one on the set can find him, and he's due for a shoot.  His trailer is a mess, full of ""party smoke"" and mysterious, scantily clad women, but Howard is nowhere to be found.  That's because he's taken a horse and ridden off into the hills near Monument Valley.  We don't know exactly why he's decided to take off, and it quickly becomes apparent that neither does Howard.  He takes a number of steps to make himself difficult to find, such as trading clothes with an old ranch hand (played by beloved character actor James Gammon).  And those are smart moves, because shortly after, a representative from the film's completion bond company arrives to check up on him, due to his notorious irresponsible behavior, and when they discover that Howard is gone, they're after him effectively like bounty hunters tracking down a criminal.Don't Come Knocking is maybe not recommendable to everyone.  The pacing is relatively slow.  The backstory and plot are told very gradually and mostly indirectly--the viewer has to infer or deduce much of it.  But the pacing is appropriately melancholy, and backstory and plot are cleverly constructed so that the viewer is taken on a parallel journey with Howard--in the beginning, Howard is wandering out of his previous life aimlessly--he's not sure where he's going or why he's going there, and as he progresses, he must piece together his authentic life (in the existential sense) from unexpected, disparate clues.Thematically, this is a film about personal and interpersonal identity, especially coming to terms with identity that has been not only deferred but effectively denied for many years.  This is true for all five major characters (Howard, Doreen (Jessica Lange), Earl (Gabriel Mann), Sky (Sarah Polley) and Howard's Mother (Eva Marie Saint)).  Howard has the most work to do on this end, of course, and he's the one who has taken the most blatant steps to defer and deny coming to terms with himself, while Howard's Mother maybe has the least amount of work to do, but she does still have work to do--notice, for example that she doesn't recognize Howard when she first sees him, and notice that despite the fact that Howard is a movie star who was important enough to be regularly covered by the tabloids, many characters who matter to the story do not recognize him from his film work.  One minor but thematically significant character from the past who does immediately recognize Howard, an old schoolmate, Cliff Ormsby (Tom Farrell), is immediately denied and rudely dismissed by Howard, because at that point, early in the film, he's still not completely ready to come to terms with himself and his past.On a technical level, everything about Don't Come Knocking is exceptional, including Wim Wenders' direction.  I was especially fond of the locations and the fantastic cinematography, as I've long been in love with the Western United States.  This is a relatively little known film that gradually snuck its way around a small number of arthouse theaters for many months throughout the spring and summer of 2006.

996546,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000FUTVP0,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[6, 8]","""Don't Come Knocking"" is directed by Wim Wenders and written and starring Sam Shepherd ('The Notebook'). The film is a visual poem, simalar to a movie like Jim Jarmusch's ""Dead Man"" and it truly is a beautiful film. The Academy of course will ignore it, but this film should be a contender for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction for this years Oscars. The movie's reviews were less-than-spectacular, but I really can't see why. I loved this film and it's one of the best films I've seen so far this year. Shepherd plays Howard Spence, a once famous actor who flees the set of his latest film with no warning. After ditching the horse he stole from the set, he travels to Nevada to reconnect with his mother (Eva Marie Saint) whom he hasn't seen in years. Meanwhile, an insurance agent named Sutter (Tim Roth, in a wonderfully quirky performance) is sent to retrieve Howard so he can finish the film. While Howard visits with his mother and revisits via a scrapbook his troubled past (alcoholism, frequent arrests, his ""fall from grace.""); His mother reveals that she heard he may have a son he doesn't know about living in Butte, Montana. When he reaches Butte, he finds an old flame Doreen (Jessica Lange) and her son, his son, Earl (Gabriel Mann) and his wacky girlfriend (Fairuza Balk, who has all-but-disappeared in the last few years). There's also a mysterious girl following him named Sky (Sarah Polley) who is equipped with the ashes of her dead mother. While I did say ""mysterious"" I guessed who she was from the beginning, it's really no big surprise...But, anyway, the film is a slow-moving dreamlike film that not everyone will like. This is definitely an art house-type of film; But it is truly a beautiful movie and the performances are great too. I don't know the kind of people who I can recommend this too, but I'll close with this. If you like well photographed films, that are wonderful to look at, have a great story (although, one that was quite simalar was used in the film Broken Flowers),and terrific performances.

996549,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B000FUTVP0,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[19, 19]","This movie is for Wim Wenders fans and a little less so for moviegoers who love breath-taking images of the American West, with an ironic sense of how the real- and movie-West often contradict each other. Most of the film's themes come together in the character of Howard Spence (Sam Shepard), a man from a ranch in Nevada who's also had a career as a cowboy movie star. His playboy carelessness (drugs, alcohol, affairs, children he's fathered and doesn't know of) is a match for the reckless abuse of the land itself, the John Ford-like setting of southern Utah where his current movie is being shot contrasting with the unreal glitter of gambling casinos in Elko and the devastated city of Butte, where the vast open pit of what was once the Anaconda copper mine is now filling with toxic ground water.For viewers a little puzzled by this rather loosely constructed and long-winded film, the DVD commentary by Wenders is a richly informative discussion of his intentions with the film along with anecdotes about making it (scenes created on the spot, the influence of painter Edward Hopper, also the story behind the final image of the film). Wenders' explanation of how he and Shepard wrote the film together and made it over a period of five years do much to account for its somewhat rambling structure.The performances by the seasoned actors are great, including Jessica Lange (who would have remained far more beautiful and expressive without a facelift) flying into an unexpected rage in her last scene with a stunned Shepard and actually dislocating her shoulder as she hits him with a big handbag. However, it was harder for this viewer to wax as enthusiastic as Wenders about his younger actors, who seemed often vague about who and what they were supposed to be.Shepard's usual themes are here - about family relationships and the dislocations between fathers and their children. The theatricality of his imagination comes through in long monologues and a funeral urn as an unfortunate stage prop. But Sam himself is wonderful to watch in this his own creation, and you hang on to the end waiting for the illumination that his playwright's mind is seeking in its journey across interior and exterior landscapes.",4,Related . . .,1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,2223,"['movie', 'Wim', 'Wenders', 'fans', 'little', 'less', 'so', 'moviegoers', 'who', 'love', 'breath-taking', 'images', 'American', 'West', 'ironic', 'sense', 'how', 'real-', 'movie-West', 'often', 'contradict', 'other', 'Most', 'film', 'themes', 'come', 'together', 'character', 'Howard', 'Spence', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'man', 'ranch', 'Nevada', 'who', 'also', 'had', 'career', 'cowboy', 'movie', 'star', 'playboy', 'carelessness', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'affairs', 'children', 'fathered', ""n't"", 'know', 'match', 'reckless', 'abuse', 'land', 'John', 'Ford-like', 'setting', 'southern', 'Utah', 'where', 'current', 'movie', 'being', 'shot', 'contrasting', 'unreal', 'glitter', 'gambling', 'casinos', 'Elko', 'devastated', 'city', 'Butte', 'where', 'vast', 'open', 'pit', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'Anaconda', 'copper', 'mine', 'now', 'filling', 'toxic', 'ground', 'water.For', 'viewers', 'little', 'puzzled', 'rather', 'loosely', 'constructed', 'long-winded', 'film', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'Wenders', 'richly', 'informative', 'discussion', 'intentions', 'film', 'anecdotes', 'making', 'scenes', 'created', 'spot', 'influence', 'painter', 'Edward', 'Hopper', 'also', 'story', 'final', 'image', 'film', 'Wenders', 'explanation', 'how', 'Shepard', 'wrote', 'film', 'together', 'made', 'over', 'period', 'five', 'years', 'do', 'much', 'account', 'somewhat', 'rambling', 'structure.The', 'performances', 'seasoned', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'including', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'remained', 'far', 'more', 'beautiful', 'expressive', 'facelift', 'flying', 'unexpected', 'rage', 'last', 'scene', 'stunned', 'Shepard', 'actually', 'dislocating', 'shoulder', 'big', 'handbag', 'However', 'was', 'harder', 'viewer', 'wax', 'as', 'enthusiastic', 'Wenders', 'younger', 'actors', 'who', 'seemed', 'often', 'vague', 'who', 'what', 'were', 'supposed', 'be.Shepard', 'usual', 'themes', 'are', 'here', 'family', 'relationships', 'dislocations', 'fathers', 'children', 'theatricality', 'imagination', 'long', 'monologues', 'funeral', 'urn', 'unfortunate', 'stage', 'prop', 'Sam', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'own', 'creation', 'hang', 'end', 'waiting', 'illumination', 'playwright', 'mind', 'seeking', 'journey', 'interior', 'exterior', 'landscapes']",N/A

The comments about scenery, cinematography, settings eating up the screen and being as interesting, if not more so, than the other characters, is on the money. Have to agree, to a degree. The visuals were as vivid and stark as an Edward Hopper painting. That aspect was glorious. But, so were the characters, in my opnion. And, if anything, boredom or tedium was not a part of my experience. It was, not surprisingly, like a play. It had it's acts and it's own slower pace, much the same as the main character himself, Sam Shepard's, Howard Spence. Howard was a longtime in waking up to the demons that haunted him and kept him settling for less as a leading man in C class western movies. It took him 20 some years to get around to owning up to a son that he either didn't know about, or drank away the memory of being told of. Whether he is after his own redemption, or working out his guilt, as Jessica Lange's character claims, or just trying to end the running from himself, this is a middle aged man, coming of age. As dysfunctional as it is, it is also quite real. After fleeing a movie set in mid-shoot, Howard heads home to see his own mother (Eva Marie Saint) where he is confronted at a sober moment, with the fact that he has a son up in Montana. Heading out in search of who and what he really is, Howard is plagued by his actions and non-actions of the past and present. Tim Roth, as a bondsman hired by the movie studios insurance company, is in dogged pursuit of the 'in breach of contract' washed up actor. Spence encounters the woman (Lange) and mother to his son, and she leads him to the bar where the off-spring, Earl, (Gabriel Mann) is fronting a band that is a twisted country version of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, with his whacked girlfriend, Amber,  (Fairuza Balk) pumping away on the harmonium. Meanwhile, Sky (Sarah Polley) yet another long lost love child of the rather busy actor lurks in shadows, carrying her mom's ashes with her throughout the story. All converge with the emotional subtlety of an internal supernova. Yep, little external action. Car chases are there, kinda, but it's no Bullit. But man, I was hooked on the dialogue, the look and feel of the film, the music by T Bone Burnett and the reality of knowing sooner or later we have to own up to who we are, like it or not.

996551,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,B000FUTVP0,Stanley Crowe,"[0, 0]","Wim Wenders has come up here with something that has the feel of a Coen brothers movie -- a playing with genre and American stereotypes that is unpretentious and yet keeps the viewer pleasantly off-balance.  It's also visually very attractive, whether we're in the west where movies are being made or in run-down parts of Butte, Montana, where the second half of the movie takes place, and where the paintings of Edward Hopper were an inspiration to the cinematographer.  The stereotype being played with here is that of the aging professional who has lost his zest for his work and fallen into bad behavior -- booze, broads, undependability.  Think of Paul Newman in ""The Verdict"" or Redford in ""The Electric Horseman.""  The conventional narrative arc will take us to ""redemption"" of some kind.  And that's the case here, but there's none of the stagy uplift or pseudo-moralizing, and while one feels that the protagonist is in a better place at the end than at the beginning, he seems to have taken a small step rather than made a wholesale turnaround.The protagonist here is Howard Spence (Sam Shepard), an aging actor, who in opening scene rides off one day from the movie he's shooting in the Montana landscape.  His journey takes him to his mother -- Eva Marie Saint, looking good and acting with fine comic self-possession -- and eventually in Butte to children he didn't know he had fathered.  Importantly for the movie's tone, this journey is not one of a tormented soul.  Howard's decampment from the movie shoot seems more like typical bad behavior -- he seems to have acquired a reputation for being unreliable -- and as played by Shepard (and Shepard did the script along with Wenders), Howard is wry and rueful rather than soul-stricken; at times he seems surprised to be where he is and unsure of what comes next.  Shepard gives a nice, understated comic performance of this character, and in a fine scene near the end, where he tells Doreen, the mother of one of his hitherto-unknown children that he came back to Butte for her, she doesn't believe him, and it's clear that he doesn't really believe it himself.  It's not that he might not mind reconnecting with the woman (Jessica Lange, doing country-resourceful faded beauty quite well), but it certainly wasn't true that he went to Butte with any clear notion of that.  He's just making it up as he goes along.What gives the story its backbone, though, is the fact that two characters, unknown to each other, take it upon themselves to call Howard back to responsibility and become searchers for him.  One is Sutter, a representative of an insurance company that wants to get him back to work on the movie he left so that his company won't be liable.  He is played by Tim Roth, in a wonderful, again low-key, comic performance that almost steals the movie.  He is the total opposite of Howard.  He is meticulous, unadventurous, dogged, and deeply pessimistic about the world, and his response to that is a refusal to do anything that's outside the rigid structure that he has made of his life.  His conversation late in the movie with Jessica Lange about the difference between hash browns and home-fries (both of which are totally unfamiliar to him) is just marvelous, as is his suspicion of Howard's mother's unfamiliar cookies. (It's he who says something like, ""The Black Death, the Inquisition . . . has anything really changed?"")  His task is to call Howard back to professional responsibilities, symbolized by the contract he had signed to do the movie.  The other searcher, Sky, is played by Sarah Polley as a daughter he never knew about.  She too gives a nice comic performance, following Howard in Butte, carrying in a pseudo-Grecian urn her mother's ashes.  She is as open and trusting as Roth's character is tight and pessimistic, and suffice it to say that by the end, they get what they want from Howard, and Howard is OK with it.  Also good is Gabriel Mann as Earl, Howard's son, who is NOT glad to see him, and his odd but basically good-hearted Goth girlfriend played by Fairuza BalkThe movie isn't ""dark"" at all, but it manages to touch on veins of feeling that are handled very credibly and surely, without upsetting the overall wry comic tone of the movie.  These involve interactions among Howard, his son, and his son's mother (Lange's character, Doreen).  The ""redemption"" scene -- or what stands in for it in this movie -- involves Howard, Sutter, Sky, Earl, and his Goth girl, and is perfectly attuned to the pervading tone of the movie, which makes it amusing as well as touching.  This isn't a great movie, but it's a good one -- unpretentious and charming, and actors and director never put a foot wrong.",4,a low-key charmer,1397779200,"04 18, 2014",2014,4703,"['Wim', 'Wenders', 'come', 'up', 'here', 'something', 'feel', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'movie', 'playing', 'genre', 'American', 'stereotypes', 'unpretentious', 'yet', 'keeps', 'viewer', 'pleasantly', 'off-balance', 'also', 'visually', 'very', 'attractive', ""'re"", 'west', 'where', 'movies', 'are', 'being', 'made', 'run-down', 'parts', 'Butte', 'Montana', 'where', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'place', 'where', 'paintings', 'Edward', 'Hopper', 'were', 'inspiration', 'cinematographer', 'stereotype', 'being', 'played', 'here', 'aging', 'professional', 'who', 'lost', 'zest', 'work', 'fallen', 'bad', 'behavior', 'booze', 'broads', 'undependability', 'Think', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Verdict', 'Redford', 'Electric', 'Horseman', 'conventional', 'narrative', 'arc', 'will', 'take', 'redemption', 'kind', 'case', 'here', 'none', 'stagy', 'uplift', 'pseudo-moralizing', 'one', 'feels', 'protagonist', 'better', 'place', 'end', 'beginning', 'have', 'taken', 'small', 'step', 'rather', 'made', 'wholesale', 'turnaround.The', 'protagonist', 'here', 'Howard', 'Spence', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'aging', 'actor', 'who', 'opening', 'scene', 'rides', 'one', 'day', 'movie', 'shooting', 'Montana', 'landscape', 'journey', 'mother', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'looking', 'good', 'acting', 'fine', 'comic', 'self-possession', 'eventually', 'Butte', 'children', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'fathered', 'Importantly', 'movie', 'tone', 'journey', 'not', 'one', 'tormented', 'soul', 'Howard', 'decampment', 'movie', 'shoot', 'more', 'typical', 'bad', 'behavior', 'have', 'acquired', 'reputation', 'being', 'unreliable', 'played', 'Shepard', 'Shepard', 'did', 'script', 'Wenders', 'Howard', 'wry', 'rueful', 'rather', 'soul-stricken', 'times', 'surprised', 'be', 'where', 'unsure', 'what', 'next', 'Shepard', 'nice', 'understated', 'comic', 'performance', 'character', 'fine', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'Doreen', 'mother', 'one', 'hitherto-unknown', 'children', 'came', 'back', 'Butte', ""n't"", 'believe', 'clear', ""n't"", 'really', 'believe', 'not', 'might', 'not', 'mind', 'reconnecting', 'woman', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'doing', 'country-resourceful', 'faded', 'beauty', 'quite', 'well', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'true', 'went', 'Butte', 'clear', 'notion', 'just', 'making', 'up', 'along.What', 'story', 'backbone', 'fact', 'two', 'characters', 'unknown', 'other', 'take', 'upon', 'call', 'Howard', 'back', 'responsibility', 'become', 'searchers', 'One', 'Sutter', 'representative', 'insurance', 'company', 'get', 'back', 'work', 'movie', 'left', 'so', 'company', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'liable', 'played', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'wonderful', 'again', 'low-key', 'comic', 'performance', 'almost', 'movie', 'total', 'opposite', 'Howard', 'meticulous', 'unadventurous', 'dogged', 'deeply', 'pessimistic', 'world', 'response', 'refusal', 'do', 'anything', 'rigid', 'structure', 'made', 'life', 'conversation', 'late', 'movie', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'difference', 'hash', 'browns', 'home-fries', 'are', 'totally', 'unfamiliar', 'just', 'marvelous', 'suspicion', 'Howard', 'mother', 'unfamiliar', 'cookies', 'who', 'something', 'Black', 'Death', 'Inquisition', 'anything', 'really', 'changed', 'task', 'call', 'Howard', 'back', 'professional', 'responsibilities', 'symbolized', 'contract', 'had', 'signed', 'do', 'movie', 'other', 'searcher', 'Sky', 'played', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'daughter', 'never', 'knew', 'too', 'nice', 'comic', 'performance', 'following', 'Howard', 'Butte', 'carrying', 'pseudo-Grecian', 'urn', 'mother', 'ashes', 'open', 'trusting', 'Roth', 'character', 'tight', 'pessimistic', 'suffice', 'say', 'end', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'Howard', 'Howard', 'OK', 'Also', 'good', 'Gabriel', 'Mann', 'Earl', 'Howard', 'son', 'who', 'NOT', 'glad', 'see', 'odd', 'basically', 'good-hearted', 'Goth', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Fairuza', 'BalkThe', 'movie', ""n't"", 'dark', 'touch', 'veins', 'feeling', 'are', 'handled', 'very', 'credibly', 'surely', 'upsetting', 'overall', 'wry', 'comic', 'tone', 'movie', 'involve', 'interactions', 'Howard', 'son', 'son', 'mother', 'Lange', 'character', 'Doreen', 'redemption', 'scene', 'what', 'movie', 'Howard', 'Sutter', 'Sky', 'Earl', 'Goth', 'girl', 'perfectly', 'attuned', 'pervading', 'tone', 'movie', 'amusing', 'as', 'well', 'touching', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'good', 'one', 'unpretentious', 'charming', 'actors', 'director', 'never', 'put', 'foot', 'wrong']",N/A

996554,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000FUTVP0,Tsuyoshi,"[8, 11]","Looking back from now, the career of Wim Wenders reached its highest point during the 1980s when he made two films - `Paris, Texas' and `Wings of Desire.' They are really not for everybody's taste, but still impressive enough to convince us that Wenders is one of the most gifted directors. Now, after some disappointing films like `End of Violence' and `Million Dollar Hotel,' Wenders returns with `Don't Come Knocking,' which is better than these two films, but still lacks the impact of the films he made 20 years ago.`Don't Come Knocking' stars Sam Shepard as washed-out Western movie star Howard Spence, who, fed up with the life of women and booze, suddenly runs away from the set riding a horse, and travels back to his mother (Eva Marie Saint). Howard's mother reveals to her son that many years ago there was a call from a woman looking for Howard, who said she had his baby. Howard continues his journey to Butte, Montana, where he believes the mother and her child can be found.Like in `Paris, Texas,' star Sam Shepard and Wim Wenders collaborated on the story, which is certainly thin, unoriginal, and often incredible, but at least more accessible than some of Wenders films. What is more attractive is the name of the cast, which includes Eva Marie Saint, Jessica Lange, Sarah Polley, Tim Roth, Gabriel Mann, and Fairuza Balk. They play the characters of the off-kilter world of Wenders - all slightly (or perhaps more) eccentric. While Sarah Polley's character Sky wanders in the streets of Butte holding an urn with her mother's ashes, saying a cryptic thing or two to Howard Spence, laconic Tim Roth, bondsman hired by the studio, never changes his inscrutable attitudes even when questioning about three ways of potato cooking.All these sometimes incomprehensible actions of the characters are presented with Wenders' a little emotionally detached touch, which may or may not attract you. It is not that Wenders does not allow the actors (or characters) to be emotional. Rather, he is more interested in the vast, infinite landscape of America, not the emotionally charged images. Thankfully, the good performances of remarkable Sarah Polley and Jessica Lange make the film's character barely credible.Still it must be said that for all the capable acting from the supports, the main character Howard is least satisfying, with miscast Shepard's one-note acting. The script makes several grave mistakes in making him the most unbelievable and a bit selfish person in the film. For example, can you believe young women gather around Howard, a washed-out has-been, and sleep with this charmless guy in bed? Do you run away from the film set riding a horse in the first place? Maybe it is Wenders' intention to represent his America with the figure of Howard, but I don't think this idea would work. At least, it didn't work for me.The photography of Franz Lustig is wonderful, and sometimes its beauty of the landscape reaches surreal level. The film has also thrilling original music by T-Bone Burnett, but despite its oddly touching moments, `Don't Come Knocking' suffers from its own quirkiness. Probably die-hard Wenders fans would savor the quirky taste of the film, but others might find the film just pointless and the story implausible.",3,"Beautiful Landscapes and Music, with Incomprehensible Characters and Story",1146787200,"05 5, 2006",2006,3259,"['Looking', 'back', 'now', 'career', 'Wim', 'Wenders', 'reached', 'highest', 'point', '1980s', 'when', 'made', 'two', 'films', 'Paris', 'Texas', 'Wings', 'Desire', 'are', 'really', 'not', 'everybody', 'taste', 'still', 'impressive', 'enough', 'convince', 'Wenders', 'one', 'most', 'gifted', 'directors', 'Now', 'disappointing', 'films', 'End', 'Violence', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Hotel', 'Wenders', 'returns', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Come', 'Knocking', 'better', 'two', 'films', 'still', 'impact', 'films', 'made', '20', 'years', 'ago.', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Come', 'Knocking', 'stars', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'washed-out', 'Western', 'movie', 'star', 'Howard', 'Spence', 'who', 'fed', 'up', 'life', 'women', 'booze', 'suddenly', 'away', 'set', 'riding', 'horse', 'travels', 'back', 'mother', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'Howard', 'mother', 'reveals', 'son', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'call', 'woman', 'looking', 'Howard', 'who', 'said', 'had', 'baby', 'Howard', 'journey', 'Butte', 'Montana', 'where', 'mother', 'child', 'can', 'be', 'found.Like', 'Paris', 'Texas', 'star', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'Wim', 'Wenders', 'collaborated', 'story', 'certainly', 'thin', 'unoriginal', 'often', 'incredible', 'least', 'more', 'accessible', 'Wenders', 'films', 'What', 'more', 'attractive', 'name', 'cast', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Gabriel', 'Mann', 'Fairuza', 'Balk', 'play', 'characters', 'off-kilter', 'world', 'Wenders', 'slightly', 'perhaps', 'more', 'eccentric', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'character', 'Sky', 'wanders', 'streets', 'Butte', 'holding', 'urn', 'mother', 'ashes', 'saying', 'cryptic', 'thing', 'two', 'Howard', 'Spence', 'laconic', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'bondsman', 'hired', 'studio', 'never', 'inscrutable', 'attitudes', 'even', 'when', 'questioning', 'about', 'three', 'ways', 'potato', 'cooking.All', 'sometimes', 'incomprehensible', 'actions', 'characters', 'are', 'presented', 'Wenders', 'little', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'touch', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'attract', 'not', 'Wenders', 'not', 'allow', 'actors', 'characters', 'be', 'emotional', 'Rather', 'more', 'interested', 'vast', 'infinite', 'landscape', 'America', 'not', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'images', 'Thankfully', 'good', 'performances', 'remarkable', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'make', 'film', 'character', 'barely', 'credible.Still', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'capable', 'acting', 'supports', 'main', 'character', 'Howard', 'least', 'satisfying', 'miscast', 'Shepard', 'one-note', 'acting', 'script', 'several', 'grave', 'mistakes', 'making', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'bit', 'selfish', 'person', 'film', 'example', 'can', 'believe', 'young', 'women', 'gather', 'around', 'Howard', 'washed-out', 'has-been', 'sleep', 'charmless', 'guy', 'bed', 'Do', 'run', 'away', 'film', 'set', 'riding', 'horse', 'first', 'place', 'Maybe', 'Wenders', 'intention', 'represent', 'America', 'figure', 'Howard', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'idea', 'would', 'work', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'me.The', 'photography', 'Franz', 'Lustig', 'wonderful', 'sometimes', 'beauty', 'landscape', 'surreal', 'level', 'film', 'also', 'thrilling', 'original', 'music', 'T-Bone', 'Burnett', 'oddly', 'touching', 'moments', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Come', 'Knocking', 'suffers', 'own', 'quirkiness', 'Probably', 'die-hard', 'Wenders', 'fans', 'would', 'savor', 'quirky', 'taste', 'film', 'others', 'might', 'find', 'film', 'just', 'pointless', 'story', 'implausible']",N/A

The Montana town where the movie was shot is straight out of a Hopper painting, exploding with sharp lonely shadows and stark sunlight, creating an eerie space where human folly and loneliness is impossible to hide.The story is a curious one, about an over-the-hill western-movie star running away from a movie set to go see his mom, played by Eva Marie Saint of the unforgettable North by Northwest, still looking beautiful at her age and acting superbly.Then the movie take a sharp turn towards a father-son drama, with a daughter also thrown in from an unexpected subplot.This is the story of a selfish man who had been away for too long from a family that he did not even knew he had. His attempts to put the broken Humpty Dumpty back together again is heartbreaking but Sam Shepard's acting is so good and his handsome cragged Marlboro Man face is so appropriate for the part that his acting almost redeems his character - almost.See this one for a quality American drama that does not have a single stale bone in it.",5,A Father-Son Drama in an Edward Hopper setting,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,1268,"['indy', 'directed', 'Win', 'Wenders', 'written', 'lead-acted', 'Sam', 'Sheppard', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'while.For', 'one', 'thing', 'immortal', 'Edward', 'Hopper', 'became', 'movie', 'director', 'instead', 'painter', ""'d"", 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'shooting', 'beauty', 'Montana', 'town', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'straight', 'Hopper', 'painting', 'exploding', 'sharp', 'lonely', 'shadows', 'stark', 'sunlight', 'creating', 'eerie', 'space', 'where', 'human', 'folly', 'loneliness', 'impossible', 'hide.The', 'story', 'curious', 'one', 'over-the-hill', 'western-movie', 'star', 'running', 'away', 'movie', 'set', 'go', 'see', 'mom', 'played', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'unforgettable', 'North', 'Northwest', 'still', 'looking', 'beautiful', 'age', 'acting', 'superbly.Then', 'movie', 'take', 'sharp', 'turn', 'towards', 'father-son', 'drama', 'daughter', 'also', 'thrown', 'unexpected', 'subplot.This', 'story', 'selfish', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'away', 'too', 'long', 'family', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'knew', 'had', 'attempts', 'put', 'broken', 'Humpty', 'Dumpty', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'heartbreaking', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'acting', 'so', 'good', 'handsome', 'cragged', 'Marlboro', 'Man', 'face', 'so', 'appropriate', 'part', 'acting', 'almost', 'redeems', 'character', 'almost.See', 'one', 'quality', 'American', 'drama', 'not', 'have', 'single', 'stale', 'bone']",N/A
996556,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000FUTVP0,Wuchak,"[3, 4]","""Don't Come Knocking"" tells the story of a 60-year-old B-Western film star (Sam Shepard) who is sick of a meaningless carnal existence, which is highlighted by almost continuous indulgence in booze, babes and brawls. While on a film set in Utah he seems to say ""F*** it all!"" jumps on a horse and flees, searching for something. What? Something deeper than what he knows and definitely a stronger reason to exist. He soon learns he has a son he never knew about from a fling over 20 years before. So he goes to Butte, Montana, where he gets reaquainted with his ex-girlfriend (Jessica Lange) and meets both a son (Gabriel Mann) and daughter (Sarah Polley). But this is hardly a warm reunion, hence the title ""Don't Come Knocking."" Meanwhile the film company sends an eccentric bounty hunter (Tim Roth) to fetch Shepard for breach of contract.The film is highlighted by magnificent Western locations and a nice modern Country/Western/Rockish score (non-twangy).Although this is generally a quiet drama, it has a hip and likable artistic flair.We can all relate to Shepard's search on some level; hence, despite the film's slow drama it easily maintains the viewer's attention throughout its 1 hour 50 minute runtime, unless you grew up on MTV and ""Armageddon,"" of course.Anyway, Shepard's two kids in the film, Earl and Sky, represent two extremes. Earl's name is fitting because he's full of volcanic rage that spits out from deep within the Earth (Earl/Earth, get it?). Sky, on the other hand, is completely spiritual in nature (hence, sky/heaven). She's full of warmth, love, compassion and forgiveness. In fact, she's the crucial Christ figure without which there would be little reconciliation for anyone in the story.Take note of the scene where Sky meets her father in his hotel room. Sky just looks at her dad with the understanding eyes of divine love. This naturally makes Shepard uncomfortable; he's never experienced this before. He doesn't know what to do, so he asks her to leave.On a side note, Jessica Lange still looks good for being in her mid-50s but I found her character strange and annoying.Also, Earl's girlfriend is an interesting freespirit who looks like Steven Tyler if he was younger and female.CONCLUSION: For all the reasons above ""Don't Come Knocking"" is a fine film worthy of repeat viewings, that is, if it sounds like your cup of java.PERSONAL GRADE: Borderline B+ or A-",4,Caught between Earth and Sky,1214265600,"06 24, 2008",2008,2403,"['Do', ""n't"", 'Come', 'Knocking', 'story', '60-year-old', 'B-Western', 'film', 'star', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'who', 'sick', 'meaningless', 'carnal', 'existence', 'highlighted', 'almost', 'continuous', 'indulgence', 'booze', 'babes', 'brawls', 'film', 'set', 'Utah', 'say', 'F***', 'horse', 'flees', 'searching', 'something', 'What', 'Something', 'deeper', 'what', 'definitely', 'stronger', 'reason', 'exist', 'soon', 'son', 'never', 'knew', 'fling', '20', 'years', 'before', 'Butte', 'Montana', 'where', 'reaquainted', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'son', 'Gabriel', 'Mann', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'hardly', 'warm', 'reunion', 'hence', 'title', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Come', 'Knocking', 'Meanwhile', 'film', 'company', 'eccentric', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'fetch', 'Shepard', 'breach', 'contract.The', 'film', 'highlighted', 'magnificent', 'Western', 'locations', 'nice', 'modern', 'Country/Western/Rockish', 'score', 'non-twangy', 'generally', 'quiet', 'drama', 'hip', 'likable', 'artistic', 'flair.We', 'can', 'all', 'relate', 'Shepard', 'search', 'level', 'hence', 'film', 'slow', 'drama', 'easily', 'viewer', 'attention', '1', 'hour', '50', 'minute', 'runtime', 'grew', 'up', 'MTV', 'Armageddon', 'course.Anyway', 'Shepard', 'two', 'kids', 'film', 'Earl', 'Sky', 'represent', 'two', 'extremes', 'Earl', 'name', 'fitting', 'full', 'volcanic', 'rage', 'out', 'deep', 'Earth', 'Earl/Earth', 'get', 'Sky', 'other', 'hand', 'completely', 'spiritual', 'nature', 'hence', 'sky/heaven', 'full', 'warmth', 'love', 'compassion', 'forgiveness', 'fact', 'crucial', 'Christ', 'figure', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'reconciliation', 'anyone', 'story.Take', 'note', 'scene', 'where', 'Sky', 'father', 'hotel', 'room', 'Sky', 'just', 'dad', 'understanding', 'eyes', 'divine', 'love', 'naturally', 'Shepard', 'uncomfortable', 'never', 'experienced', 'before', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'leave.On', 'side', 'note', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'still', 'good', 'being', 'mid-50s', 'found', 'character', 'strange', 'annoying.Also', 'Earl', 'girlfriend', 'interesting', 'freespirit', 'who', 'Steven', 'Tyler', 'was', 'younger', 'female.CONCLUSION', 'reasons', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Come', 'Knocking', 'fine', 'film', 'worthy', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'cup', 'java.PERSONAL', 'GRADE', 'Borderline', 'B+', 'A-']",N/A
