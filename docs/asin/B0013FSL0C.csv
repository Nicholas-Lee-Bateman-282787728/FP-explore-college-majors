1141828,A2K6XRL5PUKWJ9,B0013FSL0C,abbyjo,"[0, 0]","Ask yourself if you can really help anyone if you live in a bubble? This question presented in Season 1, Episode 40, Paul & Gina, week 8.Interesting are these two, Gabriel Byrne, an Irishman and Dianne Wiest, an American with Scottish roots, both about the same age and of my own generation, within a decade.  Even more ironic is the writers and producers all appear to be Israelis.  (I grew up in California, Hawaii and Israel). Anyone my age who has done time in the therapist office will recognize some of these scenes. I get the personal impression this is an Anglo interpretation of a Jewish occupation: psychotherapy which has become something else in about one generation.Gina invites Paul to look at his own perceptions of her. He has known her for decades. Or has he? Does he know HER? Or has he created a version her that fits what he needs her to be? Like a caricature, a cartoon? What do we really know about each other? Are all therapists actors, emotional, impulsive, with unresolved childhood issues who need the persona, the character they play to be controlled? Because they are struggling along with their patients, as much as their patients are with the same issues? Are the therapists USING the therapy for themselves? Is it a cult, this psychotherapy? A business? A racket? All of the above? Is it a religion? Does it only work if all parties believe in it? Only if it includes love, intimacy but not physical touch? Does it hasten divorces & suicides? Does it ever really lead to true love? Is there such a thing? Like the ever-elusive holy grail this search for truth and meaning is explored with refreshingly honest questions without answers.I cannot say that therapy helps. I cannot even be sure whether it has helped me in my past, although I spent many years involved in various forms of therapy before rejecting it. It fills a need, an emptiness, a quest for meaning. And in a way, these films do the same thing. They show us these unmet needs, these longings, these perceptions of failure and self-punishment are universal.",4,Does Therapy Help Anybody?,1401580800,"06 1, 2014",2014,2052,"['Ask', 'can', 'really', 'help', 'anyone', 'live', 'bubble', 'question', 'presented', 'Season', '1', 'Episode', '40', 'Paul', 'Gina', 'week', '8.Interesting', 'are', 'two', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Irishman', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'American', 'Scottish', 'roots', 'same', 'age', 'own', 'generation', 'decade', 'Even', 'more', 'ironic', 'writers', 'producers', 'appear', 'be', 'Israelis', 'grew', 'up', 'California', 'Hawaii', 'Israel', 'age', 'who', 'done', 'time', 'therapist', 'office', 'will', 'recognize', 'scenes', 'get', 'personal', 'impression', 'Anglo', 'interpretation', 'Jewish', 'occupation', 'psychotherapy', 'become', 'something', 'else', 'one', 'generation.Gina', 'Paul', 'look', 'own', 'perceptions', 'known', 'decades', 'know', 'HER', 'Or', 'created', 'version', 'what', 'be', 'caricature', 'cartoon', 'What', 'do', 'really', 'know', 'other', 'Are', 'therapists', 'actors', 'emotional', 'impulsive', 'unresolved', 'childhood', 'issues', 'who', 'need', 'persona', 'character', 'play', 'be', 'controlled', 'are', 'struggling', 'patients', 'as', 'much', 'patients', 'are', 'same', 'issues', 'Are', 'therapists', 'USING', 'therapy', 'cult', 'psychotherapy', 'business', 'racket', 'above', 'religion', 'only', 'work', 'parties', 'believe', 'Only', 'love', 'intimacy', 'not', 'physical', 'touch', 'hasten', 'suicides', 'ever', 'really', 'lead', 'true', 'love', 'such', 'thing', 'ever-elusive', 'holy', 'grail', 'search', 'truth', 'meaning', 'explored', 'refreshingly', 'honest', 'questions', 'answers.I', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'therapy', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'sure', 'helped', 'past', 'spent', 'many', 'years', 'involved', 'various', 'forms', 'therapy', 'rejecting', 'need', 'emptiness', 'quest', 'meaning', 'way', 'films', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'show', 'unmet', 'needs', 'longings', 'perceptions', 'failure', 'self-punishment', 'are', 'universal']",In Treatment: Season 1

1141830,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B0013FSL0C,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[6, 8]","This series, translated from an Israeli prototype, takes us to the heart of psychotherapy. It stars Gabriel Byrne as Paul Weston, a somewhat rumpled and worn-out therapist, and six patients. Each 25-minute episode is a real-time view of a therapy session.The first patient is Laura, a sexy doctor about to split with her boyfriend who reveals in the first episode that she's in love with Paul. Next comes Alex, an African-American ace fighter pilot who accidentally killed 25 children in a school in Iraq. The most gripping patient is Sophie played wonderfully by Mia Wasikowska. She's a 15-year-old Olympic gymnast whose life has gone off the rails with a suicide attempt. Fourth are Amy and Jake, a couple whose marriage is falling apart. Finally, in the fifth episode, Weston seeks guidance and spars with Gina (Dianne Wiest), a former mentor with whom he has clashed in the past.We meet each of these characters nine times during the course of the season. Other peripheral characters -- Paul's unfaithful wife and kids, Sophie's mom -- occasionally drift into the action but basically we're stuck in Paul's cluttered office watching him fiddle with his glasses as his patients pour out their troubles.Occasionally, the translation from the Israeli-version strikes a false note. One anecdote is clearly drawn from the Holocaust. Transfering it to the South in the 1940s doesn't work. In another reference, one of the characters recalls the aroma of cakes baking on a Friday afternoon suffusing the apartment building of her youth. Yes, that happens in Israel on sabbath eve but not in America.At the end of this series, we learn that Paul is at least as screwed up as his patients and that psychotherapy often doesn't work. Only one of the patients makes real progress toward a recovery. The others either stew in their juices or get worse -- in one case much worse.Still, it's fascinating viewing, well-written and acted.",4,occasionally gripping -- but it can get tiring,1257292800,"11 4, 2009",2009,1925,"['series', 'translated', 'Israeli', 'prototype', 'heart', 'psychotherapy', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Paul', 'Weston', 'somewhat', 'rumpled', 'worn-out', 'therapist', 'six', 'patients', '25-minute', 'episode', 'real-time', 'view', 'therapy', 'session.The', 'first', 'patient', 'Laura', 'sexy', 'doctor', 'split', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'first', 'episode', 'love', 'Paul', 'Next', 'Alex', 'African-American', 'ace', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'who', 'accidentally', 'killed', '25', 'children', 'school', 'Iraq', 'most', 'gripping', 'patient', 'Sophie', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', '15-year-old', 'Olympic', 'gymnast', 'life', 'gone', 'off', 'rails', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'Fourth', 'are', 'Amy', 'Jake', 'couple', 'marriage', 'falling', 'apart', 'Finally', 'fifth', 'episode', 'Weston', 'guidance', 'spars', 'Gina', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'former', 'mentor', 'whom', 'clashed', 'past.We', 'meet', 'characters', 'nine', 'times', 'course', 'season', 'Other', 'peripheral', 'characters', 'Paul', 'unfaithful', 'wife', 'kids', 'Sophie', 'mom', 'occasionally', 'drift', 'action', 'basically', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'Paul', 'cluttered', 'office', 'watching', 'fiddle', 'glasses', 'patients', 'pour', 'out', 'troubles.Occasionally', 'translation', 'Israeli-version', 'false', 'note', 'One', 'anecdote', 'clearly', 'drawn', 'Holocaust', 'Transfering', 'South', '1940s', ""n't"", 'work', 'reference', 'one', 'characters', 'aroma', 'cakes', 'baking', 'Friday', 'afternoon', 'suffusing', 'apartment', 'building', 'youth', 'Yes', 'Israel', 'sabbath', 'eve', 'not', 'America.At', 'end', 'series', 'learn', 'Paul', 'least', 'screwed', 'up', 'patients', 'psychotherapy', 'often', ""n't"", 'work', 'Only', 'one', 'patients', 'real', 'progress', 'recovery', 'others', 'stew', 'juices', 'get', 'worse', 'one', 'case', 'much', 'worse.Still', 'fascinating', 'viewing', 'well-written', 'acted']",In Treatment: Season 1

1141836,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0013FSL0C,Andy Orrock,"[3, 3]","""In Treatment"" is riveting television.  The series' first season will never be surpassed, a point that can be made more definitively now that HBO has declared a quasi-end to the show after the third season.  [There was announcement of an end followed by some waffling by HBO, so who knows at this point.]Gabriel Byrne is the engine that makes this show work.  His role of Paul Weston calls for long stretches of silence and active - almost aggressive - listening.  Then, when he talks, his words are sparse and impactful.  His understated delivery gives his observations a powerful punch.  Not everyone can pull this feat of minimalism off.  Gabriel Byrne can.  His casting is a masterstroke.Season 1 provided us with one breakout star: Mia Wasikowska.  She's simply amazing as Sophie a young suicidal gymnast.  Those of us who caught Ms. Wasikowska here feel like we were in on a secret.  The rest of the world's caught on now.I also relished the episodes with Embeth Davidtz (always a personal favorite) and Josh Charles (his 'Jake' here is a marked change from The Good Wife's Will Gardner) as well as those with Blair Underwood.  I always joke that Blair Underwood does Blair Underwood very well, but he opened my eyes here with some truly fine acting.Melissa George's Laura episodes left me a bit cold and uncomfortable, and I simply never cottoned at all to Paul's sessions with Gina (Dianne Wiest) - they're just so combative.  However, I do like Michelle Forbes and felt like she was underused as Paul's wife, Kate.  I would have had more Kate, less Gina.I'm fascinated by In Treatment's heritage as the Israeli show Be'Tipul (In Treatment (Be'Tipul) - The Complete First Season (Hebrew)).  I wish I could get an English subtitled Region 1 DVD of that.  Ayelet Zurer (The Ice Princess) and Lior Ashkenazi are two of my favorite actors.  They're the Laura and Alex equivalents in the original.  That kind of thing thrills me to know.",5,"Gabriel Byrne is the engine that makes this show work, but  Mia Wasikowska is the breakout star of Season 1",1305763200,"05 19, 2011",2011,1940,"['Treatment', 'riveting', 'television', 'series', 'first', 'season', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'surpassed', 'point', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'more', 'definitively', 'now', 'HBO', 'declared', 'quasi-end', 'show', 'third', 'season', 'was', 'announcement', 'end', 'followed', 'waffling', 'HBO', 'who', 'point', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'engine', 'show', 'work', 'role', 'Paul', 'Weston', 'long', 'stretches', 'silence', 'active', 'almost', 'aggressive', 'listening', 'Then', 'when', 'words', 'are', 'sparse', 'impactful', 'understated', 'delivery', 'observations', 'powerful', 'punch', 'Not', 'everyone', 'can', 'pull', 'feat', 'minimalism', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'can', 'casting', 'masterstroke.Season', '1', 'provided', 'one', 'breakout', 'star', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'simply', 'amazing', 'Sophie', 'young', 'suicidal', 'gymnast', 'who', 'caught', 'Ms.', 'Wasikowska', 'here', 'feel', 'were', 'secret', 'rest', 'world', 'caught', 'now.I', 'also', 'relished', 'episodes', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'always', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Josh', 'Charles', ""'Jake"", 'here', 'marked', 'change', 'Good', 'Wife', 'Will', 'Gardner', 'as', 'well', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'always', 'joke', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'very', 'well', 'opened', 'eyes', 'here', 'truly', 'fine', 'acting.Melissa', 'George', 'Laura', 'left', 'bit', 'cold', 'uncomfortable', 'simply', 'never', 'cottoned', 'Paul', 'sessions', 'Gina', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', ""'re"", 'just', 'so', 'combative', 'However', 'do', 'Michelle', 'Forbes', 'felt', 'was', 'underused', 'Paul', 'wife', 'Kate', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'Kate', 'less', 'Gina.I', ""'m"", 'fascinated', 'Treatment', 'heritage', 'Israeli', 'show', ""Be'Tipul"", 'Treatment', ""Be'Tipul"", 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'Hebrew', 'wish', 'could', 'get', 'English', 'subtitled', 'Region', '1', 'DVD', 'Ayelet', 'Zurer', 'Ice', 'Princess', 'Lior', 'Ashkenazi', 'are', 'two', 'favorite', 'actors', ""'re"", 'Laura', 'Alex', 'equivalents', 'original', 'kind', 'thing', 'thrills', 'know']",In Treatment: Season 1

Was it another ""John From Cincinnati"" that only 10% of it's viewing audience understood (or cared about)?Where was the next ""Soprano's"", ""Six Feet Under"", ""Sex in the City""? Why was I even getting HBO - I've seen their movies over and over and anything new was not anything I wanted to see so as a last ditch effort to convince myself that I ""needed"" HBO, one cold and rainy Saturday, I decided to give ""In Treatment"" a chance (I have onDemand and had access to 7 of the 9 weeks of ""sessions"" thus far).The deal was I only had to watch one or two of the 30 minutes episodes.

Okay, you already know the obvious based on my title of this review how much I liked it, but I need to state it again, GET TREATED!  It's that great.  Beyond great as a matter of fact.We get to follow the week-to-week therapy sessions of 4 individuals (including the therapist) and one couple.  If you've ever been to therapy, it's an instant recognition of the process.

It has seven discs, and by the end of disc 2, I thought to myself, this is very good again, but its not really as good as season 1. But then it started to build up. I just finished the last two discs, and I am blown away all over again! I blame the acting, the directing, and of course, the writing. Absolutely first-rate!If a show about 5 different people going to see a therapist sounds intriguing, give In Treatment a serious attempt. Each character or patient takes a while to get to the meat of their story. None of them really know what to expect in therapy, and they aren't able to trust the therapist. So as he slowly wins them over, and as they share their incredible stories- This show REALLY starts to materialize.Did I mention it is intense? If I weren't such a big macho-type-of-guy, I might have almost choked back a tear or two here! Alright- They actually got me once. Don't tell anyone! What can I say? By the end of the season 2, I found myself deeply identifying with every single character. Even the ones I didn't like for a while! But, the one that really got me in this recent season, was the 23 year-old girl who was coping with her diagnosis of cancer. Her acting and the plight of her character just really had me wanting to help her. This show is Masterpiece Theater, evolved.Unfortunately, I doubt In Treatment will ever be as popular as it deserves to be. I can't really recommend this to my friends. I don't think they would ""get"" it. I can picture them just looking at me like I was a nerd, but I've studied psychology in college and I've used therapy to get through some of my own tough times. I've been fascinated by the profession for a long time. I've seen how well it can help untie the knots in your thoughts, like a massage can handle the knots in your muscles.

The emotions running through each character feel honest and believable and every single actor delivers a brilliant performance (there are NO weak-links). The script is sharp and intelligent, and despite the lack of different locations it draws you in. I was never once bored when watching the 40+, 30 minute episodes.This show also feels realistic. For me shows that feature realism are always interesting but seem to forget the fact that the ultimate goal is to entertain it's audience. 'In Treatment' is aware of this and (especially in the first few episodes) feels like it's trying to make the audience ignore the fact that we're mostly just watching people talk. Some characters seem like they're monologing and just seem a bit too comfortable displaying every little emotion. This isn't a bad thing, and sort of gives it that indie (fore-mentioned ""experimental"") feel, but doesn't really make you forget you just spent the last 30 minutes watching a conversation.Oh, and there are no extras on the DVD's (unless I'm totally missing something). The show's good enough, but I would've loved to see interviews with the cast (especially since there's a new cast for season 2). To me no extras just feel like a missed opportunity with DVD sets. I realise you're mostly buying the DVD's for the show itself, but considering you can stream most episodes online it kinda makes you think twice before purchasing this DVD set.With television shows these days trying to 'out-create' each other, it's nice to see a series that truly does more with less.

1141863,A10KZH9EO4W2N7,B0013FSL0C,"Jedi ""PeaceSoldier""","[6, 7]","""In Treatment"" is an extremely underrated series that shines and displays amazing originality. An intriguing HBO series that has both; an overall theme and underneath it lies a brilliant underlining storyline that is never viewed with restlessness. This might not be for the action-packed, police/murdering, or mystery suspenseful audience but is extremely close to the reality of dealing with conflict/trauma using the tools of psychoanalysis. Not your typical ""shrink"" program.Introducing and delving into the human psyche. A mid-level psychological series which often catches and releases the viewer to ponderous questions of one's own consciousness. Storyline mainly involves 5/6 diverse characters with different but relative challenges. Follow characters through weekly sessions of discovery, denial, challenge, betrayal on their wayward heroes' journey, along with many twists of coincidence...or is it fate?Script is well researched and character development is extraordinary. Mia Wasikowska (Sophie)(Alice in Wonderland) establishes herself as a young 5 star actress who very well may be the best up-an-coming young actress I've ever seen in a television series, Gabriel Byrne (therapist) is flawless within duality roles of not only providing therapy but as a conflicted human.

Despite its artistic integrity and psychological complexity, I just couldn't stand the characters anymore.  This show outshines the quality of any six prime-time network dramas, yet as it stretched over forty-eight episodes, I reached the point where these characters resembled fingernails on the chalkboard.Nearly every half-hour episode occurs in Dr. Paul Weston's office, or that of his mentor Gina.  This confinement, and the remarkably small cast, force viewers into a claustrophobic relationship with an ensemble linked by the magnitude of their dysfunctions.  We have to adjust our rhythms to those of the series, which is no small task.  But this means that, despite its low-key demeanor, this show leaves us feeling remarkably purged.But as the characters rabbit on, apparently reveling in misery and disturbance, they started to grate on me.  I've undergone therapy, so I know the difficulty we face when we realize our need to change our most destructive habits, but these characters seemingly want to stay broken.  Indeed, watching Paul lead Laura on, while Gina yanks Paul's leash, they seemingly want to spread their brokenness around to everyone else equally.Which leaves me in the awkward position of recognizing the artistic accomplishment played out on my TV screen, while simultaneously wanting to rid myself of these characters and their misguided indiscretions.

Following four patients over the course of nine weeks is intriguing in itself (despite the psychobabble involved) because the stories develop and build but what really kindled my interest was the fact that the therapist himself (played by Gabriel Byrne) is under treatment as well and in doing so is openly sceptical about psychotherapy and its use. The sessions between him and his therapist (played by Dianne Wiest) are crackling with animosity and cynicism; if it weren't for these I might not recommend the series. The rest is OK, the acting is sometimes excellent - particularly that of Mia Wasikowska, who on this showing has the makings of a great actress, and of Dianne Wiest, who already is just that - the various cases mostly keep a good balance between realism and drama, and Gabriel Byrne is always worth watching. He is blessed with one of those faces so redolent of Depth Of Character that he doesn't even need to act. He can just sit there and his face will do all the work for him.Drawbacks? It could be extremely monotonous for some; virtually everything takes place in one room and it's almost all talk - anybody who begins to fidget after half a dozen lines of dialogue will find this very heavy-going. There are a few pieces of drama but probably not enough to satisfy on their own; if you don't enjoy listening to conversation you'd best leave this alone.

Moore,"[0, 0]","""In Treatment"" has one of the simplest but most powerful premises for any TV series in history: various therapy patients come to the home office of Dr. Paul Weston (Gabriel Byrne) and lay bare their souls. ""In Treatment"" creator Rodrigo Garcia--adapting a series that originally appeared on Israeli TV--has assembled a fascinating group of characters. They include Alex (Blair Underwood), a hotshot Navy pilot beset by feelings of guilt and inadequacy; Sophie (Mia Wasikowska), a suicidal teenage gymnast; Jake (Josh Charles) and Amy (Embeth Davidtz), a mismatched married couple on the brink of divorce; and--most disturbing for Dr. Weston--Laura (Melissa George), a sexually confused doctor with an obsessive crush on Dr. Weston.As the series progresses, we see that Dr. Weston himself is not without problems, and definitely not without character flaws that would be much improved by therapy. He is chilly and demanding toward Kate (Michelle Forbes), his increasingly fed-up wife, and he also has issues with Gina Toll (Dianne Wiest), his own therapist and former mentor.The 43 episodes are extremely brief (the average length is about 25 minutes, but some are as short as 20), concentrated, and brilliantly written, often leaving viewers gasping for air. But it is the performances that really carry ""In Treatment"" and make it a must-see program. Every actor on the show deserves to be singled out for praise; however, I will say that Byrne is rock-solid as the show's anchor, and Wasikowska clearly reveals herself to be one of the finest actors of her generation.

Then this is the perfect series for you, because here the whole point is to explore the inner lives of the characters.Does the the fact that this series focuses a great deal on the emotions of the characters mean that there is no ""action?"" Only if you define ""action"" as soley encompassing explosions or giant robot attacks.To me, however, there was more action in this show than almost any other I've seen: there was the complexity of coming to terms with the guilt of death, of a disintergrating marriage, of children torn between parents, of unrequieted love, of the intense pressures to be successful, of professional jealousy, of the quiet desperation of everyday life, and the pain and bravery of those trying to take control of their lives.The writing is really quite incredible. I was time and again rivited by the ways in which the story tellers captured and traced the emotionally raw and complex workings of the human heart- the tangled web which constitutes human relationships.Some detractors have said they find the characters ""annoying:"" these characters strike me as ""real,"" for, in life, people are themselves complex and full of paradoxes, at times annoying but at others deeply sympathetic. I came to be involved with all the characters, and, in the end, they all suprised me, up until the very last episode.The acting is also superb. Gabriel Byrne (as the therapist ""Paul"") gives the performance of his lifetime, and Mia Wasikowska gives a star making performance as ""Sophie,"" a troubled gymnast.This is a show for people who find themselves interested in the human mind and heart, particularly, in the complex ways in which we become entangled with our fellow human beings, and often punish ourselves, lie to ourselves, and hide from our own inner truths. What is the thrill of an asteroid threatening to destroy the Earth compared to the everyday struggle with such things as love, guilt, and the fear of facing another day on this planet.Truly, one of the great shows I have seen- original, thought provoking, powerfully acted, intelligently written, and as deep and as rich a portrait of the human soul as we're likely to ever get on television.",5,A Show Where All The Action Takes Place Within The Human Heart,1208044800,"04 13, 2008",2008,2575,"['powerful', 'deeply', 'moving', 'intelligent', 'emotionally', 'nuanced', 'series', 'consisting', 'nothing', 'more', 'psychotherapy', 'sessions', 'cast', 'reoccuring', 'characters', 'show', 'important', 'niche', 'missing', 'most', 'television', 'richness', 'complexity', 'heartbreak', 'emotional', 'life', 'Are', 'tired', 'seeing', 'thin', 'carbon-copied', 'cliched', 'characters', 'movies', 'television', 'shows', 'Then', 'perfect', 'series', 'here', 'whole', 'point', 'explore', 'inner', 'lives', 'characters.Does', 'fact', 'series', 'great', 'deal', 'emotions', 'characters', 'mean', 'action', 'Only', 'define', 'action', 'soley', 'encompassing', 'explosions', 'giant', 'robot', 'however', 'was', 'more', 'action', 'show', 'almost', 'other', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'complexity', 'coming', 'terms', 'guilt', 'death', 'disintergrating', 'marriage', 'children', 'torn', 'parents', 'unrequieted', 'love', 'intense', 'pressures', 'be', 'successful', 'professional', 'jealousy', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'everyday', 'life', 'pain', 'bravery', 'trying', 'take', 'control', 'lives.The', 'writing', 'really', 'quite', 'incredible', 'was', 'time', 'again', 'rivited', 'ways', 'story', 'tellers', 'captured', 'traced', 'emotionally', 'raw', 'complex', 'workings', 'human', 'heart-', 'tangled', 'web', 'human', 'relationships.Some', 'detractors', 'have', 'said', 'find', 'characters', 'annoying', 'characters', 'strike', 'real', 'life', 'people', 'are', 'complex', 'full', 'paradoxes', 'times', 'annoying', 'others', 'deeply', 'sympathetic', 'came', 'be', 'involved', 'characters', 'end', 'suprised', 'up', 'very', 'last', 'episode.The', 'acting', 'also', 'superb', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'therapist', 'Paul', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'star', 'making', 'performance', 'Sophie', 'troubled', 'gymnast.This', 'show', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'interested', 'human', 'mind', 'heart', 'particularly', 'complex', 'ways', 'become', 'entangled', 'fellow', 'human', 'beings', 'often', 'punish', 'ourselves', 'lie', 'ourselves', 'hide', 'own', 'inner', 'truths', 'What', 'thrill', 'asteroid', 'threatening', 'destroy', 'Earth', 'compared', 'everyday', 'struggle', 'such', 'things', 'love', 'guilt', 'fear', 'facing', 'day', 'planet.Truly', 'one', 'great', 'shows', 'have', 'seen-', 'original', 'thought', 'provoking', 'powerfully', 'acted', 'intelligently', 'written', 'deep', 'rich', 'portrait', 'human', 'soul', ""'re"", 'likely', 'ever', 'get', 'television']",In Treatment: Season 1
