1097102,ABSF90T08ADBX,B000UX6THK,"A. Conner ""earthsleep""","[0, 0]","When I was young adult this show appeared on television to what many call and have called an acclaimed experience.  I didn't participate.  As the years have laboured on I would hear references to the show such as ""not as odd as Twin Peaks"" or ""a show as groundbreaking as Twin Peaks"" etc.  I still didn't participate but I did take notice.A year ago I bought this definitive collection of Twin Peaks not for curiosity but for nothing more important than a few dollars burning a hole in my pocket and that the aformentioned edition was on sale on this site.  When it arrived, I placed the item straight to my shelf where it stayed for 13 months like an ignored and even rejected toy collecting dust in the corner.Out of an urge to watch something original and with very little options I thought I would give Twin Peaks a try starting with the original pilot movie.  Impressed by it's originality I chewed on another episode, and then another as if it were a piece of delectable chocolate where once gone the only thing to do is reach for another.As the episodes marched on I found myself in suspense, awe, humor, and curiosity but through it all what never escaped me is the beauty that the series projects.  It's beauty lies not in it's soap opera like quality which I am normally not fond of, but in it's philosophy of asking a great question; are we in fact mere elements in a dream?  The entire series is painted in a dreamlike, surreal haze as its music and its movements sway you back and forth like gentle ripples do to a floating boat.  Perhaps the soap opera portrayed in the show called ""Invitation To Love"" is a metaphor for that.  As if Mr. David Lynch was trying to ask the question; is someone else watching us the same way these characters are watching that television show?  Are we in fact as Shakespeare put it players but on someone else's stage acting out nothing more than the idea of humanity before any of us have a chance to spawn.Twin Peaks has another message embedded in its places.  The ideas of human treachery and righteousness.  The town in question is in fact filled with the real but unpleasant distinction that all of us have at the very least some blackness in our blood that tends to spread when ignored, but if reversed in time we do not have to become poisoned by it.  Decency is crucial in surviving this dark heart that we all may succomb to in life if we aren't carful.  Twin Peaks is layered in characters with their own uniqueness and quality that all of us have and all of us would notice if we would look at each other a little closer.Whatever you the consumer's hunger whether it be for an entertaining splash of humor or a deep watered well of mystery and character Twin Peaks is sweet with all of this and something else.

Naturally!When one of the Swedish cable channels re-run the series, they did it (perhaps on purpose) one hour pass midnight. I was sitting in the dark, with the television on a low volume, and watched the bizarre episodes. It was almost a spiritual experience. The music was very much part of it, too. Of course, I was disappointed by the incomprehensible last episode. Poor Leo.I remember that my brother really hated Dr. Jacoby and his red-green Hawaiian specs. I also remember that his girlfriend wore an FBI jacket, just as Agent Cooper! Also, some joker in our neighbourhood spray-painted the following spoiler on the local junior high school: ""LAURA'S FATHER DID IT"". My father didn't get the occult aspect, and steadfastly maintained that Leland was the killer, and that Bob was a fictitious entity. Most Swedes stopped watching the series long before the murderer was revealed. It was just too strange.Finally, I remember speculating about David Lynch's in-house jokes. Sherilyn Fenn (Audrey Horne) stars in both ""Twin Peaks"" and ""Wild at Heart"". In ""Wild at Heart"", she has crashed a red corvette. In ""Twin Peaks"", Leo owns a red corvette. Sherilyn Fenn was rumoured to be the girlfriend of the singer Prince, who has recorded a song called ""Little Red Corvette"". Also, Fenn and her new boyfriend Johnny Depp supposedly owned a red corvette. Bingo! And what about Kyle MacLachlan, who stars an FBI agent from Seattle in both ""Twin Peaks"" and ""The Hidden""? In both productions, he chases a supernatural killer! Hmmm...In hindsight, I must admit that I'm less pleased with ""Twin Peaks"". Much of the bizarre stuff which struck me as great fun as a young adult, isn't so funny any more. Often, ""Twin Peaks"" comes across as a comic show. But what's so funny about the sadistic rape and murder of a teenage girl, anyway? Or about child abuse or brothels? It's the contrast between the grizzly realities and the comic aspect that I can't really stand any more. Perhaps I'm more mature...But no, I don't want to ban the show or anything like that. Besides, there are even worse forms of entertainment than watching ""Twin Peaks"". If you like strange plot developments, constant references to the occult, and have a really weird sense of humour, you will probably like the series.

Something ominous is in the air.What do you get when you take Peyton Place and mix in some murder, mystery, romance, comedy and horror? David Lynch's surreal serial, Twin Peaks. It's like a soap opera with some film noir, sinister undertones, and touches of weird comedy. It was such an acquired taste, so different from what the TV audience was used to seeing... it took risks and changed the landscape of watch we watch.The series begins so well, with a big whodunit introduced instantly which pulls the viewer in to a very unusual town. As a dramatic pilot episode, this is great stuff. (By the way: Skip the European version of the pilot; stick with the regular network version.)Overall it's an innovative and fascinating series, a strange and brief one. It burned bright and then was extinguished. It certainly had its charms, and its flaws. ""Twin Peaks"" was not perfect but it was delightfully quirky and peculiar. We meet some extraordinary characters, hear some wonderful music by Angelo Badalamenti, and are transported to a place that we only might have dreamed about before. David Lynch paints his images in vivid strokes: romances are intense and pure, while evil is repulsive and dangerous.

The episodes themselves have beautiful clarity, perhaps more so than when they originally aired, and I found the extras to be both informative and entertaining.For those not familiar with ""Twin Peaks"", it was a strange and exhilerating television experience, the likes of which I had never seen when it first aired.  Conceived by David Lynch and Mark Frost, it is a dark and deeply disturbing journey into the psyche of a seemingly normal, all-American town.  The sudden bursts of violence were shocking for a network television show in the early '90's, and those images still pack a punch today; there is an unsettling eeriness that prevails through most of the episodes, leavened by quirky, sometimes oddball humor supplied by the eccentric inhabitants of Twin Peaks.The brilliant David Lynch has stated that Twin Peaks belongs to the same universe as  his underrated ""Lost Highway"", and there is a certain similarity of themes that are constant, I think, through not only ""Highway"", but ""Mulholland Drive"", and the earlier ""Blue Velvet"".  They all seem to be part of a macabre world that looks familiar, but is, somehow, not our own.The cast of ""Twin Peaks"" is enormous and everyone seems to inhabit their characters to an impressive degree.  I can't think of a villain in television history who is more terrifying than the diabolical Bob; the very sight of him slithering and cackling makes one want to scream.  As played by Frank Silva, he is the essence of unending horror and the stuff that nightmares are made of.  Even the madman Windom Earle (Kenneth Welsh)can't hold a candle to Bob's demonic presence.On the flip side of the coin, the series' lawmen--FBI agent Cooper and Sheriff Harry S. Truman--are wonderful, stalwart, brave men, vividly brought to life by, respectively, Kyle MacLachlan and Michael Ontkean.  ""Twin Peaks"" was, perhaps, the finest hour for both actors.  MacLachlan has gone on to lesser (I think), husbandly roles in ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""Sex and the City"", but I'll always remember him chiefly for this turn as Dale Cooper.  Of the many other cast members, the great Piper Laurie is deliciously malicious as scheming Catherine Martell, with Jack ""Eraserhead"" Nance on hand as her clueless, cuckholded husband, Pete; Joan Chen is convincingly demur and devious as the traitorous Josie; and Richard Beymer is both touching and amusing as nutty, rich hotelier/bordello owner, Benjamin Horne.  Ray Wise and Grace Zabriskie offer a touching and, ultimately, chilling portrait of a grief-stricken married couple.  The younger cast members are also compelling, especially Madchen Amick, Sherilyn Fenn, Lara Flynn Boyle, and Sheryl Lee, who plays both the ill-fated Laura Palmer (whose murder sets the series in motion) and her lookalike cousin, Maddy Ferguson. In fact, it would be difficult to single out any performer in the series who isn't dead-on with their characterizations.While the pilot and Season 1 are pretty much flawless, Season 2 almost sinks a few times, due to some seemingly superfluous plot developments that do nothing to advance the plot. In fact, getting through episodes 17-22 may require some patience and a certain level of tolerance for out-and-out inanity.  It's worth hanging in there for the remaining episodes because they come close to recapturing the essence of the earlier shows, and, in some cases, surpass the exhuberance and sheer weirdness that was displayed in the first season.  Anyone expecting everything to be neatly wrapped up in the finale will be sorely unamused, although, for me, ""Twin Peaks"" is more a case of the journey being more important than the destination.  I think ""Twin Peaks"" is as close to a television series masterpiece as has ever been produced for American television.",5,What about BOB???,1212537600,"06 4, 2008",2008,4224,"['cultural', 'phenomenon', '1990-92', 'run', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'up', 'wonderfully', 'well', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'later', 'gold', 'box', 'edition', 'original', 'pilot', 'international', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'episodes', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'all-too-brief', 'two', 'season', 'run', 'reading', 'viewers', 'problems', 'discs', 'was', 'concerned', 'might', 'run', 'same', 'Happily', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'set', 'ordered', 'Amazon', 'was', 'perfect', 'episodes', 'have', 'beautiful', 'clarity', 'perhaps', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'found', 'extras', 'be', 'informative', 'entertaining.For', 'not', 'familiar', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'was', 'strange', 'exhilerating', 'television', 'experience', 'likes', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'Conceived', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Mark', 'Frost', 'dark', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'journey', 'psyche', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'all-American', 'town', 'sudden', 'bursts', 'violence', 'were', 'shocking', 'network', 'television', 'show', 'early', ""'90"", 'images', 'still', 'pack', 'punch', 'today', 'unsettling', 'eeriness', 'most', 'episodes', 'leavened', 'quirky', 'sometimes', 'oddball', 'humor', 'supplied', 'eccentric', 'inhabitants', 'Twin', 'Peaks.The', 'brilliant', 'David', 'Lynch', 'stated', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'same', 'universe', 'underrated', 'Lost', 'Highway', 'certain', 'similarity', 'themes', 'are', 'constant', 'think', 'not', 'only', 'Highway', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'earlier', 'Blue', 'Velvet', 'seem', 'be', 'part', 'macabre', 'world', 'familiar', 'somehow', 'not', 'own.The', 'cast', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'enormous', 'everyone', 'inhabit', 'characters', 'impressive', 'degree', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'villain', 'television', 'history', 'who', 'more', 'terrifying', 'diabolical', 'Bob', 'very', 'sight', 'slithering', 'cackling', 'one', 'want', 'scream', 'played', 'Frank', 'Silva', 'essence', 'unending', 'horror', 'stuff', 'nightmares', 'are', 'made', 'Even', 'madman', 'Windom', 'Earle', 'Kenneth', 'Welsh', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'Bob', 'demonic', 'presence.On', 'flip', 'side', 'coin', 'series', 'lawmen', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Cooper', 'Sheriff', 'Harry', 'S.', 'Truman', 'are', 'wonderful', 'stalwart', 'brave', 'men', 'vividly', 'brought', 'life', 'respectively', 'Kyle', 'MacLachlan', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'was', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'hour', 'actors', 'MacLachlan', 'gone', 'lesser', 'think', 'husbandly', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'Sex', 'City', ""'ll"", 'always', 'remember', 'chiefly', 'turn', 'Dale', 'Cooper', 'many', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'great', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'deliciously', 'malicious', 'scheming', 'Catherine', 'Martell', 'Jack', 'Eraserhead', 'Nance', 'hand', 'clueless', 'cuckholded', 'husband', 'Pete', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'convincingly', 'demur', 'devious', 'traitorous', 'Josie', 'Richard', 'Beymer', 'touching', 'amusing', 'nutty', 'rich', 'hotelier/bordello', 'owner', 'Benjamin', 'Horne', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'Grace', 'Zabriskie', 'offer', 'touching', 'ultimately', 'chilling', 'portrait', 'grief-stricken', 'married', 'couple', 'younger', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'also', 'compelling', 'especially', 'Madchen', 'Amick', 'Sherilyn', 'Fenn', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'Sheryl', 'Lee', 'who', 'ill-fated', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'murder', 'series', 'motion', 'lookalike', 'cousin', 'Maddy', 'Ferguson', 'fact', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'single', 'out', 'performer', 'series', 'who', ""n't"", 'dead-on', 'characterizations.While', 'pilot', 'Season', '1', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'flawless', 'Season', '2', 'almost', 'few', 'times', 'due', 'seemingly', 'superfluous', 'plot', 'developments', 'do', 'nothing', 'advance', 'plot', 'fact', 'getting', 'episodes', '17-22', 'may', 'require', 'patience', 'certain', 'level', 'tolerance', 'out-and-out', 'inanity', 'worth', 'hanging', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'come', 'close', 'recapturing', 'essence', 'earlier', 'shows', 'cases', 'surpass', 'exhuberance', 'sheer', 'weirdness', 'was', 'displayed', 'first', 'season', 'Anyone', 'expecting', 'everything', 'be', 'neatly', 'wrapped', 'up', 'finale', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'unamused', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'more', 'case', 'journey', 'being', 'more', 'important', 'destination', 'think', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'as', 'close', 'television', 'series', 'masterpiece', 'ever', 'been', 'produced', 'American', 'television']",N/A

""Twin Peaks"" was a fantastic show that was quite experimental for its time (1990-1991) that at it's worst was better than most everything else on TV. I wish the show could have survived longer, but with an awful second season time slot - Saturday at 10pm - it had no chance. The revelation of Laura Palmer's killer took the wind out of the sails somewhat just nine shows into the second season, but the true theme of Twin Peaks was about the evil in the woods that took the form of the killer and the seamy underbelly of what appeared to be everyday small-town life. The murder of Laura Palmer was just the surface of that. Three somewhat pointless episodes followed the one that revealed Laura's killer, but then the show bounced back with the Windham Earle storyline. Unfortunately many viewers had stopped watching the show by then. Perhaps the lasting legacy of ""Twin Peaks"" is that it made series with weird subplots, long story arcs, and oddball characters more acceptable to the networks. For example, I don't think that ""The X-Files"" could have made it to the air in 1993 had it not been for ""Twin Peaks"" preceding it and succeeding. After all, after a show where there is a dwarf that materializes on a bed, dances, and talks backwards, an alternate reality where clones are created and sent out to the world, and creamed corn as a symbol of suffering, the adventures of Scully and Mulder look as thematically tame as Dragnet.As for the extra features of each disc, that will probably eventually appear in the product description.

1097118,A3PD0NM46NWGU6,B000UX6THK,Carlos,"[8, 9]","I must be a bit crazy because watching Twin Peaks is always an emotional experience for me. I get misty-eyed at the oddest moments. Maybe memories are triggered from 1990 when the show first aired and how my friends and I would routinely convene at a coffee shop or diner late at night and recount our theories and revelations about that week's particular episode or maybe I'm reminded of how those same friends dropped out of watching Twin Peaks somewhere in the middle of season two and I felt I was the last person on earth carrying the torch. Regardless, this is simply the quirkiest and most dreamlike television series ever created and even in today's landscape of made-for-cable shows that ""push the envelope"", nothing....and I mean....NOTHING can touch Twin Peaks.With this set you get the entire series and the long awaited original pilot episode along with a slew of extras. Keep in mind that you'll have to hold on to those seperate seasons 1 and 2 box sets because many of the special features on those sets are not repeated here.For those new to the series: The first season is worthy of all the praise heaped on it back in 1990. In fact much of Twin Peaks' reputation rests on those early episodes. Season two suffers from the quick resolution of Laura Palmer's murder and a scrapped plotline about Dale Cooper and Audrey Horne (a romance that viewers were certainly expecting give the direction the show was going in and, in my opinion, a missed opportunity that could have saved the series). Things get back on track by the end of season two and the season finale might just be the weirdest thing to ever air on TV.As other reviewers have mentioned the documentaries here are top notch (it's fun to watch David Lynch turn to jelly at the mere presence of Madchen Amick) and both Lynch and Mark Frost lament being pressured by ABC to solve Laura Palmer's murder. The mystery of Laura Palmer was the bait that kept viewers interested. Revenge is sweet, however, because it just might be the last episode of the show, with it's horrifying unresolved plot twist, that has kept faithful fans enthralled with the world of Twin Peaks ever since and leaves them wondering ""what happens next?"".

1097120,A3628L43ZVEMP5,B000UX6THK,Christopher Twelvetrees,"[6, 8]","My experience of ""Twin Peaks"" is perhaps unique.  My brother died in 1990 a few weeks before the show, which I looked forward to with some anticipation, began.  Not quite ready to face up to Laura Palmer's demise, I taped the first, movie-length episode as well as all the subsequent episodes for about a month.  Therefore, while my co-workers were avidly discussing the show in its early days, I had to tune them out.Eventually, feeling up to the experience, I took a day off from work and watched all the episodes I had taped (a full VHS).  That is the way to enter Twin Peaks.  By the time I watched those episodes, my co-workers were already losing interest in the show and falling to the wayside;  the show had too many characters and its plots were too complex for weekly viewing.  My coworkers were unable to keep up with it and so long interest fast.  In my case, on the other hand, watching the pilot and the first four or five episodes in a marathon tv session set the continuity (such as it is) in my head. Once this is done, the viewer can take his time to luxuriate in the doings of this strange northwestern town.From the first episode, ""Twin Peaks"" had a lot of charm and quirky humor to help one through the rougher periods of murder, abduction, etc.  It's too bad it wasted a lot of viewer interest on inconsequential stories and characters.For anyone wanting to see the televised TP, all the episodes are here (even a ""European"" version of the pilot, where a solution of sorts to the mystery of Laura Palmer's murder is offered).  Where this Gold Box is incomplete is that it does not include the prequel movie ""Fire Walk with Me.""  That's probably a good thing, since the movie was terrible.  Not including it also eliminates the temptation to watch it first.  ""Fire"" gives away the murderer, and the tension of who killed Laura Palmer is really all that sustains the first (short) season.This box does offer several interesting extras.  One is an informative look behind the scenes at making the series.  Another is the reclusive David Lynch himself having a conversation with a couple of cast members (Kyle MacLachlan and the still-beautiful M&auml;dchen Amick), though their talk merely whets one's appetite for more.  All the regular episodes have optional ""Log Lady"" introductions (which, incidentally, are, as you might expect, less than helpful;  they often get so silly you can see the actress trying to choke down a laugh from time to time).This Gold Box is the way to visit ""Twin Peaks.""  It allows those necessary marathon sessions that lets the viewer get the story straight.  Simply turn TP on and watch it until you drop off;  then pick it up later and start again.But viewers will probably approach this series out of curiosity for a long-dead cult series that has no life left in it.  when it was being broadcast, once I entered the world of ""TP"" I watched the show religiously right up to the last  episode (hoping, near the end, they could pull a rabbit out of a hat).Viewing it again for the first time after twenty years, I was surprised at how boring it all is once one knows the killer's identity.  During the short-lived ""Twin Peaks"" craze of 1990 one did not notice how stories were being unnecessarily spun out at length.  These days, many parts of the series resemble jokes that go on too long for their punch-lines to pay off.No spoilers here: but in one of the extras a co-creator of the series, Mark Frost, complains that he and Lynch never intended to expose Laura Palmer's killer, and the network (ABC) forced them to.  If that is so, hurray for the network.  If Frost had gotten his way, by the end of the second season TP would have been nothing more than self-parody.  You can only carry on a ""Who Killed Laura Palmer?"" so long before it becomes silly and derided, and the resolution is rendered meaningless.  Watching TP as whole, rather than waiting a week (or a summer) to see the next episode, I think they solved Laura Palmer's murder at just the right moment.  It's too bad they had nothing to put in its place.As admitted in the making-of documentary, having no story to entice viewers back after resolving the murder of Laura Palmer was damning to the series.  (If you want my two cents, they should immediately have delved into the White Lodge/Black Lodge dichotomy, perhaps having everyone in Twin Peaks choose to be in one Lodge or the other for a climactic battle for the soul of the town.)Anyway, watching TP again, by the time Heather Graham entered the cast I was only too ready for the show to peter out.  That's too bad, since TP began as both entertaining and innovative.  Unfortunately, the writers must have preferred adding new characters to the mix as an alternative to inventing and telling good stories.For anyone who has never seen TP, it's probably worth watching all the way through once.  For old Peaksies like me . . . well, I'm fast-forwarding through anything having to do with the paternity of Lucy's baby, or the saga of James Hurley when he leaves town, or . . .  It's intriguing, how little is actually lost from the thrust of the series by excising certain narratives;  and how the series might have been helped at the time by a little judicious pruning.Anyway, I loved TP once and the Gold Box is a keeper, the way one clings to pictures of old girl or boyfriends.  And it's nice having the disk of extras.",3,"Not Everything Peaksean, and That's Good",1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,5396,"['experience', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'perhaps', 'unique', 'brother', 'died',

1097121,A33FCLUEQSUD68,B000UX6THK,Claire,"[1, 1]","What an incredible show! I think it's safe to say that this show paved the way for many shows following it. Unfortunately, it got cancelled before its time, but then we'll never know if it would have to continued to be great or if it left us as it should have: wanting more. I think of ""Lost"" and how it started out such a terrific thriller that held our attention and fascinated us but then wound its way into the ground as if torn apart by the smoke monster. We were not left wanting more, we were left wondering how we could get the last few years of our lives back. Not so with ""Twin Peaks."" It was good enough to leave us wanting more and this dvd box set gives us a little bit more. We are treated to the entire series here on dvd in great condition but without too many fancy bonus commentaries and behind-the-scenes interviews that I find take away from a show's fiction and the viewer's imagination. Maybe ""Lost"" would've remained more of a cool mystery if the cast wasn't featured each week on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live."" There is a good interview with David Lynch + some of the cast members and I liked the addition of the SNL footage as well as the featurette about the annual ""Twin Peaks""a-looza held in Washington. That's right, young ""Twilight"" fans, WA state was known to us as home of Twin Peaks way before it was known to you as home of Forks! This show remains a classic and if you like creepy stuff, this show will be sure to appeal to you. Watching it now is just as satisfying as back in 1990.

1097124,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000UX6THK,Cubist,"[10, 11]","Several years ago when the first season of Twin Peaks debuted on DVD it was heavily criticized for not including the Pilot episode. This was due in large part to rather complex legal reasons. Now, fans can throw away their bootlegs because this new box set collects every episode of the show, including the Pilot episode and its European cut which features a tacked on ending that Frost and Lynch were required to add in case it didn't get picked up as a series. The Lynch-approved transfer for this episode is breathtaking to behold and you can also enjoy it in a new 5.1 surround mix or the original 2.0. This holds true for the rest of the episodes.Of note, if you own the separate first and second seasons, hold onto them as the extra material they have are not included on this new edition. I did notice a few soundbites from some of the interviews on the second season set but not all of them.The ninth disc includes only four deleted scenes that are apparently the only extra footage to survive from the show (although, if you look on YouTube there is more). We get more of Audrey's autistic brother Johnny while Cooper and Truman question Dr. Jacoby. We also get footage of Lucy and Deputy Andy buying doughnuts for the rest of the police department and more insight into the dysfunctional Horne family.An interesting addition is the ""Production Documents,"" a collection of call sheets and production breakdowns that provide a look at the mechanics behind the show.The tenth disc features the bulk of the extras, all created with the care and craft of someone who is truly a fan of the show. ""A Slice of Lynch"" reunited Lynch with cast members Madchen Amick and Kyle MacLachlan over, you guessed it, pie and coffee. They are joined by Lynch's long-time assistant John Wentworth. Lynch briefly talks about the origins of the show while Amick and MacLachlan talks about how they got their respective roles.Lynch is clearly still frustrated that the network pressured him and Frost to solve Laura's murder and seems to still be a little sweet on Amick which is a lot of fun to see play out.The most substantial extra is a detailed look at the making of and legacy of the show in a feature-length documentary called, Secrets from Another Place: Creating Twin Peaks that can also be viewed in four separate featurettes. It takes us through the creation of the Pilot episode with Mark Frost (who, up until now, has not appeared in previous TP DVD extras) taking us through it. Several of the actors talk about how they were cast, including Ray Wise (who originally tried out for Sheriff Truman). The making of both seasons is also covered with cast members Miguel Ferrar, Piper Laurie, Sherilyn Fenn and others talking about their experiences while crew members speak about how the sets came together and how it was really a director-driven show. Everyone talks about how the show became a pop culture phenomenon and how the country was obsessed with who killed Laura for a short time. The show's atmospheric soundtrack is also examined with Angelo Badalamenti talking about how he met Lynch and taking us through the genesis of one of the pieces of music from the show. Cast and crew speak candidly about the flaws of the second season and how it suffered once Laura's murder had been solved and Frost and Lynch went on to do other things. This is a very informative and well-made doc featuring people who have not contributed to previous DVD editions. Best of all, it is accessible to newcomers and devotees alike.""Saturday Night Live"" features Kyle MacLachlan's monologue the night he hosted (and which he ""reveals"" who killed Laura) and a sketch that parodies Twin Peaks. This was done in the early 1990s with an excellent cast at the time. Phil Hartman does a great impersonation of Leland Palmer and if you look closely Conan O'Brien plays Deputy Andy.""Twin Peaks Festival"" takes a look at the dedicated fanbase and the few fans that go to the Festival once a year. Several of them talk about what they love about the show and what the festival means to them. This featurette really captures the spirit of what it must be like to attend one of these events.Also included is an ""Interactive Map"" of eight key locations from the show, with footage of what it looks like now and a clip from the show back in the day. This extra also lists the address for said location so that you can organize your own tour.""The Black Lodge Archive"" is a treasure trove of bits and pieces, including a music video for ""Falling"" by Julee Cruise who appeared on the show as the singer at the Roadhouse. There are the Georgia Coffee commercials that were shown only in Japan and were directed by Lynch and featured several cast members appearing as their characters from the show. A selection of Richard Beymer's personal collection of photographs that were taken on the set are also featured, as well as trading cards that were produced around the time of the show. You can also watch 12 ""On-Air Promos and Spots"" that really take you back to that time. There are even the 1-900 Hotline Promo spots (I had forgotten about those!) with all eight messages for people who wanted clues to the show at the time. Finally, there are the ""Lucy Bumpers"" that bookended the show before and after commercials.Finally, with the packaging comes a nice collection of glossy postcards featuring stills from the show. Sadly, the entire set is not included with the implication that you have to buy additional box sets in the hopes of getting them all (yeah, right).",5,"Finally!

It has great music, unforgettable characters, labyrinthine plots, the perfect setting, and does it all while being simultaneously disturbingly alienating and engrossingly, invitingly, quirky. It's a blast to settle in and watch, even today when I know if not all the answers, then at least what is going to happen. Talk about a landmark show, without Twin Peaks would there have ever been Northern Exposure? The X Files? Even in this decade, HBO's Carnivale? At its best, Twin Peaks showcased how good American network television could still be. At its worst...well, I won't concentrate on the flaws or what Twin Peaks became when its writers and cast ran low on inspiration and in general let the series hang around a little too long. (Are you reading this, makers of Lost?) I remember growing up I heard so much about this series that I wanted to watch it, and because it featured murder, incest and the like, my dad said I wasn't allowed, which naturally made me all the more determined to see it no matter what. Eventually I rented the pilot episode and was blown away by how great Twin Peaks was. I had to struggle for years to find episodes taped off TV, and usually these were multi-generation bootlegs with poor quality.

The viewer is kept on his toes by clues that are placed around and everyone seems to be strange enough(by sitcom tv standards) that everyone is a potential murderer.Thats one of the main themes of the show, lighten up America, dont be afraid of having a personality. Dont be so paranoid. Weird does not equal murderer, or terrorist, or bad person. I think that theme is if nothing else more relevant today than when Twin Peaks was released.Great, great show.

It seems everyone in the town of Twin Peaks adored her, so her death is a blow. FBI Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) is assigned to the case -- which seems connected to his past work -- so he settles down at the comfy Twin Peaks hotel and continues investigating.And Twin Peaks' secrets start surfacing -- love affairs, madness, wackos, corporate devilry, and drugrunning. And clues about Laura are cropping up: a bloody shirt, a drug deal, a secret affair and a heart necklace. People catch glimpses of a one-armed man and a grey-haired killer -- and Cooper has a prophetic dream with both men, as well as a red room, a double of Laura Palmer, and a tiny man who dances to jazz music.The second season introduces more unrest for the inhabitants of Twin Peaks -- and an injured Cooper (Kyle McLachlan) has a vision that may have something to do with Laura Palmer's death. Midway through the season he finds who it was (or rather, who it SEEMS to be). But that's not the only plotline in the second season -- we also get a psychopathic ex-Fed, parasitic demons, a disastrous beauty pageant, strange caves, and a twin pair of ""Lodges"" that seem to exist outside space and time... which Cooper's murderous ex-partner is searching for.""Twin Peaks"" starts off as a basic murder mystery, but rapidly becomes something a lot stranger and more frightening. It becomes a bit weaker during the second season -- especially when Laura's killer is revealed prematurely -- but it's still strange and darkly humorous right up to the flawed cliffhanger end.And Lynch and Frost knew how to spin a great TV show -- they took the usual murder mysteries, and loaded it down with eerie symbolism, creepy visions and inscrutable (but important) lines (""Through the darkness of future past, the magician longs to see....""). And there are arcs that stretch through the series, slowly unfolding their secrets like dark roses.But it's not just strange-weird, but strange-funny too. And the dialogue has that brilliant quirkiness that most series cannot keep going for long (""Fellas, don't drink that coffee! You'd never guess... there was a fish in the percolator""). Considering how likably strange the characters are -- including Cooper -- it's not too surprising that it's crammed with quotables (""Black as midnight on a moonless night...."" ""Pretty black"").And the characters are VERY odd too. Cooper himself is played with quirky brilliance by McLachlan -- he's a bright, lovable, friendly kind of guy who loves Tibetan mysticism, tape recorders and a ""damn fine cup of coffee."" He becomes even more likable as the series goes on, and we get to see some of his more tragic dimensions.And Cooper flanked by a number of talented actors playing two basic varieties of characters: the relatively normal ones with a slight quirk, such as abusive truckers, the sheriff, teen lovers, and obnoxious FBI agents who offend the residents of Twin Peaks. And the REALLY strange ones, like the weird Log Lady, the one-armed man, the spacey Lolita, and the eerie spirits that haunt Twin Peaks.There are a large number of new extras -- the entire set is beautifully remastered, with documentaries, featurettes, interviews with actors and creators of the series, and other lovely tidbits for the die-hard fan. It's all very nice, the icing on the proverbial cult-classic cake.The entirety of ""Twin Peaks"" is hard to even describe, because the plots were a perfect balance of the surreal and mundane -- and the entire series is a dark cult gem from beginning to imperfect end.",5,"Murder, mysticism and cherry pie",1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,4130,"['Twin', 'Peaks', 'was', 'ultimate', 'cult', 'TV', 'show', 'suspenseful', 'complex', 'hilariously', 'written', 'hidden', 'layers', 'casual', 'channel-flippers', 'might', 'not', 'catch.Though', 'lasted', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Mark', 'Frost', 'classic', 'series', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'television', 'dozens', 'intertwined', 'subplots', 'mystery', 'death', 'lot', 'deeper', 'just', 'murder', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'seasons', 'AND', 'pilot', 'are', 'united', 'box', 'set', 'must', 'have', 'cult', 'TV', 'enthusiasts.The', 'body', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'Sheryl', 'Lee', 'up', 'shore', 'wrapped', 'plastic', 'everyone', 'town', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'adored', 'death', 'blow', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Dale', 'Cooper', 'Kyle', 'MacLachlan', 'assigned', 'case', 'connected', 'past', 'work', 'so', 'down', 'comfy', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'hotel', 'investigating.And', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'secrets', 'start', 'surfacing', 'love', 'affairs', 'madness', 'wackos', 'corporate', 'devilry', 'drugrunning', 'clues', 'Laura', 'are', 'cropping', 'up', 'bloody', 'shirt', 'drug', 'deal', 'secret', 'affair', 'heart', 'necklace', 'People', 'catch', 'glimpses', 'one-armed', 'man', 'grey-haired', 'killer', 'Cooper', 'prophetic', 'dream', 'men', 'as', 'well', 'red', 'room', 'double', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'tiny', 'man', 'who', 'jazz', 'music.The', 'second', 'season', 'introduces', 'more', 'unrest', 'inhabitants', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'injured', 'Cooper', 'Kyle', 'McLachlan', 'vision', 'may', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'death', 'Midway', 'season', 'who', 'was', 'rather', 'who', 'SEEMS', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'plotline', 'second', 'season', 'also', 'get', 'psychopathic', 'ex-Fed', 'parasitic', 'demons', 'disastrous', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'strange', 'caves', 'twin', 'pair', 'Lodges', 'seem', 'exist', 'outside', 'space', 'time', 'Cooper', 'murderous', 'ex-partner', 'searching', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'off', 'basic', 'murder', 'mystery', 'rapidly', 'something', 'lot', 'stranger', 'more', 'frightening', 'bit', 'weaker', 'second', 'season', 'especially', 'when', 'Laura', 'killer', 'revealed', 'prematurely', 'still', 'strange', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'right', 'up', 'flawed', 'cliffhanger', 'end.And', 'Lynch', 'Frost', 'knew', 'how', 'spin', 'great', 'TV', 'show', 'took', 'usual', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'loaded', 'down', 'eerie', 'symbolism', 'creepy', 'visions', 'inscrutable', 'important', 'lines', 'darkness', 'future', 'past', 'magician', 'longs', 'see', 'are', 'arcs', 'stretch', 'series', 'slowly', 'unfolding', 'secrets', 'dark', 'roses.But', 'not', 'just', 'strange-weird', 'strange-funny', 'too', 'dialogue', 'brilliant', 'quirkiness', 'most', 'series', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'going', 'long', 'Fellas', 'do', ""n't"", 'drink', 'coffee', ""'d"", 'never', 'guess', 'was', 'fish', 'percolator', 'Considering', 'how', 'likably', 'strange', 'characters', 'are', 'including', 'Cooper', 'not', 'too', 'surprising', 'crammed', 'quotables', 'Black', 'midnight', 'moonless', 'night', 'Pretty', 'black', '.And', 'characters', 'are', 'VERY', 'odd', 'too', 'Cooper', 'played', 'quirky', 'brilliance', 'McLachlan', 'bright', 'lovable', 'friendly', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'Tibetan', 'mysticism', 'tape', 'recorders', 'damn', 'fine', 'cup', 'coffee', 'even', 'more', 'likable', 'series', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'tragic', 'dimensions.And', 'Cooper', 'flanked', 'number', 'talented', 'actors', 'playing', 'two', 'basic', 'varieties', 'characters', 'relatively', 'normal', 'ones', 'slight', 'quirk', 'such', 'abusive', 'truckers', 'sheriff', 'teen', 'lovers', 'obnoxious', 'FBI', 'agents', 'who', 'offend', 'residents', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'REALLY', 'strange', 'ones', 'weird', 'Log', 'Lady', 'one-armed', 'man', 'spacey', 'Lolita', 'eerie', 'spirits', 'haunt', 'Twin', 'Peaks.There', 'are', 'large', 'number', 'new', 'extras', 'entire', 'set', 'beautifully', 'remastered', 'documentaries', 'featurettes', 'interviews', 'actors', 'creators', 'series', 'other', 'lovely', 'tidbits', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'very', 'nice', 'icing', 'proverbial', 'cult-classic', 'cake.The', 'entirety', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'hard', 'even', 'describe', 'plots', 'were', 'perfect', 'balance', 'surreal', 'mundane', 'entire', 'series', 'dark', 'cult', 'gem', 'beginning', 'imperfect', 'end']",N/A

1097132,A1GXBMUTVHWHJL,B000UX6THK,Flash,"[0, 0]","A landmark in television history, Twin Peaks has had a lasting impact an episodic (story-arc) television to this day. Back in the early 1990's when it was released, Twin Peaks was the only show of it's kind. It was distinctly different, weird and intelligent all at the same time. It was the kind of show that forced you to pay attention and then to try to piece together the meanings of what you had just viewed. I've just finished watching the whole series over the last few weeks, and so I've  once again been reminded of just how good this show is. Twin Peaks is without a doubt, a classic!This Gold Box Edition contains every episode from seasons 1 and 2 plus the pilot movie. My recommendation on the pilot is to hold off on watching the European ending until after you have watched the whole series. There are options on the first disk to allow you to do this. The first 15 or so episodes deal primarily with the mystery surrounding the death of Laura Palmer, but at the same time introduce you the town and the characters of Twin Peaks. It is in the second half of the series that the underlying mythology of Twin Peaks is gradually introduced. The ending is fascinating and unique and will have you thinking about the series as a whole.Good Things About Twin Peaks:cinematic, mystery, story-arc, characters, weirdness, mythology, ending, philosophy, setting, dialogue, wood, coffee, pieSo-So Things About Twin Peaks:brief interlude (Ben Horne) during the last third of the series that seems to drag, occasional daytime soap opera quality to the character interaction and dialogue, wondering why the population of Twin Peaks is listed as over 50,000. These are all minor problems.But in the end, this show is fantastic. The last 25 minutes of the last episode is brilliant and it is amazing. It's a final send off and payoff for the whole series. In my viewing experience, only one TV scene has had such avant-garde feel to it, the Milennium episode from season 2 called The Fourth Horseman.There are plenty of extras and the shows creator, David Lynch, seems to reveal that much of the show was created as they want along.

The first season hardly wastes a frame, it just flows beautifully. The troubling, surreal element hovers on the threshold for the most part - only really breaking cover at the series finale. People moan and groan about season 2 but the episodes up to the big reveal are still right up there in quality for me. I'll admit things go awry for a while after this, the light touch goes amiss and the plot lines try too hard to confound your expectations of certain characters, a bloke named Dick pops up, Lynch forgets what a cameo is and starts writing himself in as a love interest (kind of), David Duchovny turns up in a dress (no, really) and the character of James proves that when you leave the surrounds of Twin Peaks even the cameras can hardly bare to watch anymore. Even more painful are the looks on Heather Graham and Billy Zane's faces, both suffering the same fate of being parachuted in as unlikely love interests for long established lead characters - they wear the pained expressions of those who know deep down they don't truly belong.Thankfully the final three episodes are incredibly strong, and the grand finale itself is one of Lynch's greatest achievements full stop. A backward speaking, dwarf spotting, blank eyed screaming, coffee spilling trip to 'another place'. Even the excessively hammy Wyndham Earle gets scary in episode 29 - yeah, believe it or not you can actually over act in Twin Peaks though it must have taken a Herculean effort from Kenneth Welsh!The making ofs are well worth watching too - especially the snippets of interviews with Mark Frost who reveals some juicy information regarding the creative process and course the show took and Angelo Badalamenti whose working style as expected appears to be a match made in heaven with Lynch.Diane, this Twin Peaks boxset is beyond essential, make sure you purchase a copy and send it to me as soon as possible...",5,Bob's Your Uncle,1335139200,"04 23, 2012",2012,2019,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'Lynch', 'man', 'genius', 'believe', 'much', 'show', 'very', 'best', 'work', 'first', 'season', 'hardly', 'frame', 'just', 'beautifully', 'troubling', 'surreal', 'element', 'hovers', 'threshold', 'most', 'part', 'only', 'really', 'breaking', 'cover', 'series', 'finale', 'People', 'moan', 'groan', 'season', '2', 'episodes', 'big', 'reveal', 'are', 'still', 'right', 'there', 'quality', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'things', 'go', 'awry', 'while', 'light', 'touch', 'amiss', 'plot', 'lines', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'confound', 'expectations', 'certain', 'characters', 'bloke', 'named', 'Dick', 'up', 'Lynch', 'what', 'cameo', 'writing', 'love', 'interest', 'kind', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'up', 'dress', 'really', 'character', 'James', 'when', 'leave', 'surrounds', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'even', 'cameras', 'can', 'hardly', 'bare', 'watch', 'anymore', 'Even', 'more', 'painful', 'are', 'looks', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'suffering', 'same', 'fate', 'being', 'parachuted', 'as', 'unlikely', 'love', 'interests', 'long', 'established', 'lead', 'characters', 'wear', 'pained', 'expressions', 'who', 'know', 'deep', 'do', ""n't"", 'truly', 'belong.Thankfully', 'final', 'three', 'episodes', 'are', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'grand', 'finale', 'one', 'Lynch', 'greatest', 'achievements', 'full', 'stop', 'backward', 'speaking', 'dwarf', 'spotting', 'blank', 'eyed', 'screaming', 'coffee', 'spilling', 'trip', ""'another"", 'place', 'Even', 'excessively', 'hammy', 'Wyndham', 'Earle', 'scary', 'episode', '29', 'yeah', 'believe', 'not', 'can', 'actually', 'over', 'act', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'Herculean', 'effort', 'Kenneth', 'Welsh', 'making', 'ofs', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'too', 'especially', 'snippets', 'interviews', 'Mark', 'Frost', 'who', 'juicy', 'information', 'regarding', 'creative', 'process', 'course', 'show', 'took', 'Angelo', 'Badalamenti', 'working', 'style', 'expected', 'be', 'match', 'made', 'heaven', 'Lynch.Diane', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'boxset', 'essential', 'make', 'sure', 'purchase', 'copy', 'send', 'as', 'soon', 'possible']",N/A

1097143,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000UX6THK,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","It all starts the way we remember the film, but we soon are going to be lost in translation, we are going to lose our memory and we are bound to loosen our minds into something that sounds like derangement. And we find out in the final ""Lost and Found"" that some lines were dropped along the way that would have made the surreal aspect even deeper, darker and bleaker.A long bloody series of killings one after the other brings a federal Special Agent, a certain Dale Cooper, into the picture of this panoramic and flabbergasting mountain-scape from upland Wasington at the very border to Canada. And we wonder why a great film director decided to become the director - and creator - of a TV series. And we do not know, and we cannot know, and the concerned director could not even know himself. He felt the impulse, he needed some extra money, or he wanted to discover some new territory. But who cares anyway.This series produced in 1990-1991 and followed by the film ""Twin Peaks, Fire Walk With Me"" in 1992 opened completely new territories and trails in TV art, because TV can be an art. First it completely dropped the autonomous episode syndrome and the whole series is but one story that cannot be considered as sliced up in episodes that would be autonomous one from the other. Each episode ends up with a strong at times melodramatic, most of the type pretty dramatic last touch that is supposed to create fear and to call for anxiety and expectation. And it is not simply what Stephen King recalls about the special teenage matinee films in the old days with one serial character, with one unified episode each week, and yet each one ending right in the most atrociously suspenseful event, like a cliffhanger just losing his grip two thousand feet over the firm ground at the foot of the cliff, but after concluding his business of the week just before.In the case of this series that suspenseful last touch is in fact opening a new can of worms that is an amplification of the very episode and yet forcing us to lose all our certainty about what has happened in this episode, hence throwing our minds into disbelief and doubt about the whole story line and what could come next. This suspense does not require us to suspend our disbelief. It creates in our consciousness absolute disbelief about any hypotheses or conclusion we might have come to.And sure enough from a simple detective story, a banal crime story or even a lackluster serial killer story we move to a vengeance story, a ghost story, a supernatural story, a fantastic dark fantasy of a story that never stops going beyond the margin and limits of natural circumstances.This series has had many descendants, many children and grandchildren, from ""Lost"" to ""Supernatural"" or all the mini series produced by Stephen King or other people in the same line. As such David Lynch has opened up a real can of real rodent bugs that are haunting us, gnawing at our guts and munching our vitals with teeth of steel.The present Gold Box Edition is particularly welcome because the modern definition of our screens and the wide size of these screens being what they are, this product that was done for low definition and small screens becomes magical. The editor of the set goes as far as giving us, at the very end some small scenes that were deleted, supposedly lost and miraculously retrieved, precisely in the low definition of the time and we can remember the fuzziness of these pictures, though at the time it was less visible because the screens were so small that the pixels were nearly microscopic.We thus can enjoy the rich setting slightly overcrowded with props and detail, the encumbered movements and actions that find all their power and force in today's technical conditions, all for our best enjoyment.But does it mean anything?I am afraid not. I can't really tell you the end, but let's say it is becoming common today, especially after the last volume of the ""Dark Tower"" series by Stephen King in which the last page of the seventh and chronologically last volume is word for word the same as the first page of the very first volume. David Lynch is a lot more complex than just repeating the first scene of the first episode in the last scene of the last episode, but altogether it is the same pattern. Life is eternal because it repeats itself. Life is deadly, fatal, lethal, because it can start all over again just after death has struck.The only deeper reflection you may get out of this series is that nature is beautiful, man, (and woman) is a dirty littering filthy polluting animal but deep deeper deepest in this world the polluter always gets it right bang in their faces. There is always a pine weasel that can bite your nose. Apart from that it is pure entertainment and story telling, even if at times the story telling is kind of twisted and farfetched.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,"Be patient, the end is the best part of that

This was his stab at episodic television.  Although the show only lasted two seasons, they were two ground-breaking seasons.  The town of Twin Peaks is almost a character itself, as the sleepy logging town hiding too many secrets.FBI agent (played by Kyle MacLachlan) will learn many of the town's secrets.  But first his main mission is to investigate the death of a local high school girl named Laura Palmer.  His investigation into this death leads him down various ""rabbit holes"" as powerful people in the town try to misdirect his search.  He quickly unravels other possible crimes linked to other citizens in the town.  His only ally is the local police chief, who seems to be the only honest person in the town.The series is special because of the colorful characters.  Each one is interesting to watch.  Each one has some sort of secret to hide or revenge to carry out.  The dialogue (in typical Lynch fashion) is sometimes funny, disturbing, and odd- usually at once.  The series is definitely a drama, and yet there is always a comedic scene or two in every episode.This series pre-dates ""The X-Files"".  The similarity is that both series deal with the abnormal.

I should have held off buying the second season, but the suspense was killing me so I purchased it when it came out this past April.  I hope Paramount is providing plenty of extras to justify this deluxe edition other than a gold wrapping, as the pilot was included in the Special Edition Season One box set.  If they had gotten their act together the first time and released it all in one box set, we wouldn't have had to go trough this ordeal.It has been over six years since Season One was released on DVD by Republic Pictures, without the crucial pilot episode, which so galled Twin Peaks fans. The next year an attractive special edition was released in the UK, as well as other countries, that included the pilot as well as additional material. The box set has the ghostly image of Laura Palmer underneath her portrait.  This is the edition I have.  Then came another long wait before the Second Season was finally released early this year in a rather bland format by Paramount, with little in the way of extra features other than log lady intros.During this time there have been various bootleg DVD sets as well as more polished releases of the complete series.  Apparently the sticking point had been regaining the rights to the pilot, which Lynch had sold to Warner Home Video.  Finally, American audiences will be able to view the complete set of episodes, including the pilot, in this Gold Box Edition.  If Parmount, Universal and other studios want to avoid piracy they should get their act together and treat television series in their entirety, not release them piecemeal, with long waits in between seasons.  It really made no sense at all in the case of Twin Peaks, which only ran for two seasons, a total of 29 episodes plus the two-hour pilot episode.The Gold Box Edition is long overdue, but of course it comes with a hefty price tag.

1097149,ABDAHMRYSMMIV,B000UX6THK,"John Ellis ""jonthes""","[1, 1]","""Twin Peaks"", like ""Lost"" and ""The Prisoner"", is a beautifully wrought epic film made possible by broadcasting it as a television series. Large sections of it are better made technically than the vast majority of feature films. The hair in the butter with all three is that no ending can be satisfying. Someday an artist will make one of these projects and build a structure with an ending that will seem surprising but entirely right instead of painting themselves into a corner just to keep their own interest. So far a stunning ending is the only thing that has eluded the creators of these three projects. It should be noted that it is very rare for a film director to successfully control color - Hitchcock in ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"", Viscounti in ""Death in Venice"" (a little over done actually) - and David Lynch with ""Twin Peaks"". The shots of the lumber factory where the machines seem to have a malevolent mind of their own as saws thoughtfully hone other saws (mechanical reproduction?) or turn trees from natural phenomena into slabs of wood are some of the most disturbing shots of the film, particularly in this new brilliant transfer. Lynch is also a brilliant caster of actors and the writing is so sharp and on point that all his actors have to do is act through it, always the secret of performing good material and often abused by American actors, who train on soap opera dialogue. The gimmicks that made the series a relative hit when first released seem more genuine with time. It's a shame Frost and Lynch didn't stay focused on the series in the second year, as it is the masterpiece of their careers. The contempt ABC showed by moving it around and wrecking the audience for it may have been somewhat mirrored in the divided attention of its creators.",5,"Like ""Lost"", a beautiful epic film.",1195776000,"11 23, 2007",2007,1778,"['Twin', 'Peaks', 'Lost', 'Prisoner', 'beautifully', 'wrought', 'epic', 'film', 'made', 'possible', 'broadcasting', 'television', 'series', 'Large', 'sections', 'are', 'better', 'made', 'technically', 'vast', 'majority', 'feature', 'films', 'hair', 'butter', 'three', 'ending', 'can', 'be', 'satisfying', 'Someday', 'artist', 'will', 'make', 'one', 'projects', 'build', 'structure', 'ending', 'will', 'seem', 'surprising', 'entirely', 'right', 'instead', 'painting', 'corner', 'just', 'keep', 'own', 'interest', 'So', 'far', 'stunning', 'ending', 'only', 'thing', 'eluded', 'creators', 'three', 'projects', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'very', 'rare', 'film', 'director', 'successfully', 'control', 'color', 'Hitchcock', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Vertigo', 'Viscounti', 'Death', 'Venice', 'little', 'done', 'actually', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'shots', 'lumber', 'factory', 'where', 'machines', 'seem', 'have', 'malevolent', 'mind', 'own', 'saws', 'thoughtfully', 'hone', 'other', 'saws', 'mechanical', 'reproduction', 'turn', 'trees', 'natural', 'phenomena', 'slabs', 'wood', 'are', 'most', 'disturbing', 'shots', 'film', 'particularly', 'new', 'brilliant', 'transfer', 'Lynch', 'also', 'brilliant', 'caster', 'actors', 'writing', 'so', 'sharp', 'point', 'actors', 'have', 'do', 'act', 'always', 'secret', 'performing', 'good', 'material', 'often', 'abused', 'American', 'actors', 'who', 'train', 'soap', 'opera', 'dialogue', 'gimmicks', 'made', 'series', 'relative', 'hit', 'when', 'first', 'released', 'seem', 'more', 'genuine', 'time', 'shame', 'Frost', 'Lynch', 'did', ""n't"", 'stay', 'focused', 'series', 'second', 'year', 'masterpiece', 'careers', 'contempt', 'ABC', 'showed', 'moving', 'around', 'wrecking', 'audience', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'somewhat', 'mirrored', 'divided', 'attention', 'creators']",N/A

1097158,A1OZAYRJQAERTK,B000UX6THK,Larry Benjamin,"[0, 0]","I came to &#34;Twin Peaks&#34; late; in fact, I just watched it for the first time this year. It came out toward the end of my &#34;I hate television&#34; period, so I missed it when it was first aired. So I will attempt to approach it from how it must have looked in 1990, rather than now. Most of this will be speculative, as I watched almost no TV in the 80s, and was overseas toward the end of the decade. So I'm a novice with regard to television in general, and the 1980s in particular.As pure drama, it doesn't compare well to more recent HBO and Showtime series, which in some cases rival the best cinema. And the science-fictiony real-life weirdness has since been surpassed by &#34;Buffy,&#34; &#34;Angel,&#34; &#34;Fringe,&#34; and many others. But at the time, there had never been a show like &#34;Twin Peaks,&#34; that blended the supernatural with what appeared on the surface to be an ordinary small town plagued with several inexplicable crimes. Some of it seems gratuitously bizarre for its own sake: the &#34;log lady,&#34; the giant, the midget, the deaf FBI agent who hears one woman clearly, the police chief named &#34;Harry S Truman&#34; for no apparent reason, the hostile romance between the &#34;slow&#34; secretary and the even slower cop, the painfully sincere army officer who studies UFOs, the unbelievably snooty haberdasher, the brain-damaged former hoodlum, the FBI agent who gathers clues from dreams and visions, the woman with the eyepatch who suddenly gains superhuman strength after an unsuccessful suicide attempt, and starts thinking she's a teenager again, and a murderous demon who possesses townspeople, and so on. Later series integrated these types of elements more seamlessly into the plots and backgrounds.One original feature of &#34;Twin Peaks&#34; was the mushrooming cast of characters and the blizzard of multiple storylines. It was a leap from the single plotline of most sitcoms, and the plot/subplot structure of most dramas until then. Today, multiple plot structure is typical, where a series will have several multi-episode or seasonal plots, along with several shorter plots that are resolved within each episode. Six concurrent storylines is hardly unusual now. I've heard that this assumes a more intelligent and attentive viewership capable of following everything. In 1990, this must have been a radical idea, along with the faith that viewers would not be put off by the &#34;weirdness.&#34;&#34;Twin Peaks&#34; was pioneering in that it did many of these things first, but as a cult show, it had a relatively small but devoted viewership. Whether it was actually influential, or merely first, would depend on whether any of its fans were involved in any later productions. It would seem that the &#34;Buffyverse&#34; owes something to &#34;Twin Peaks,&#34; but only Joss Whedon could confirm that.",4,"""The owls are not what they seem""",1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,2863,"['came', '34', 'Twin', 'Peaks', '34', 'late', 'fact', 'just', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'year', 'came', 'out', 'end', '34', 'hate', 'television', '34', 'period', 'missed', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'aired', 'will', 'attempt', 'approach', 'how', 'must', 'have', 'looked', '1990', 'rather', 'now', 'Most', 'will', 'be', 'speculative', 'watched', 'almost', 'TV', '80s', 'was', 'overseas', 'end', 'decade', ""'m"", 'novice', 'regard', 'television', 'general', '1980s', 'particular.As', 'pure', 'drama', ""n't"", 'compare', 'well', 'more', 'recent', 'HBO', 'Showtime', 'series', 'cases', 'rival', 'best', 'cinema', 'science-fictiony', 'real-life', 'weirdness', 'been', 'surpassed', '34', 'Buffy', '34', '34', 'Angel', '34', '34', 'Fringe', '34', 'many', 'others', 'time', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'show', '34', 'Twin', 'Peaks', '34', 'blended', 'supernatural', 'what', 'appeared', 'surface', 'be', 'ordinary', 'small', 'town', 'plagued', 'several', 'inexplicable', 'crimes', 'gratuitously', 'bizarre', 'own', 'sake', '34', 'log', 'lady', '34', 'giant', 'midget', 'deaf', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'one', 'woman', 'clearly', 'police', 'chief', 'named', '34', 'Harry', 'S', 'Truman', '34', 'apparent', 'reason', 'hostile', 'romance', '34', 'slow', '34', 'secretary', 'even', 'slower', 'cop', 'painfully', 'sincere', 'army', 'officer', 'who', 'studies', 'UFOs', 'unbelievably', 'snooty', 'haberdasher', 'brain-damaged', 'former', 'hoodlum', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'clues', 'dreams', 'visions', 'woman', 'eyepatch', 'who', 'suddenly', 'gains', 'superhuman', 'strength', 'unsuccessful', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'thinking', 'teenager', 'again', 'murderous', 'demon', 'who', 'townspeople', 'so', 'Later', 'series', 'integrated', 'types', 'elements', 'more', 'seamlessly', 'plots', 'backgrounds.One', 'original', 'feature', '34', 'Twin', 'Peaks', '34', 'was', 'mushrooming', 'cast', 'characters', 'blizzard', 'multiple', 'storylines', 'was', 'leap', 'single', 'plotline', 'most', 'sitcoms', 'plot/subplot', 'structure', 'most', 'dramas', 'then', 'Today', 'multiple', 'plot', 'structure', 'typical', 'where', 'series', 'will', 'have', 'several', 'multi-episode', 'seasonal', 'plots', 'several', 'shorter', 'plots', 'are', 'resolved', 'episode', 'Six', 'concurrent', 'storylines', 'hardly', 'unusual', 'now', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'more', 'intelligent', 'attentive', 'viewership', 'capable', 'following', 'everything', '1990', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'radical', 'idea', 'faith', 'viewers', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'put', 'off', '34', 'weirdness.', '34', '34', 'Twin', 'Peaks', '34', 'was', 'pioneering', 'did', 'many', 'things', 'first', 'cult', 'show', 'had', 'relatively', 'small', 'devoted', 'viewership', 'was', 'actually', 'influential', 'merely', 'first', 'would', 'depend', 'fans', 'were', 'involved', 'later', 'productions', 'would', 'seem', '34', 'Buffyverse', '34', 'something', '34', 'Twin', 'Peaks', '34', 'only', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'could', 'confirm']",N/A

1097160,A5GIYITYJPWN1,B000UX6THK,"L P ""lilip""","[2, 2]","What a mind bender. Twin Peaks is one of the strangest and most innovative TV shows ever made. It is lurid, eerie, surreal, terrifying, quirky and absorbing. It is an odd little saga with odd components, including the usual mundane stuff and the paranormal - along with strong performances that make it all work. It is a genius mix of soap opera, parody, mystery/detective show, and horror film, all thrown together to create something insanely complex, surreal and entirely original. It is symbolic, it is insane and it is tragic.It is symbolic, it is insane and it is tragic. The brilliance of this show lies in the fact that it can completely parody and mock its characters at one moment, and take them and their feelings completely serious the next while at the same time creating an unexpectedly terrifying and somber mood. The tragedy surrounding Laura Palmer's death is palpable and heart breaking, resulting in the show creating an emotional resonance that reveals that Lynch is not to be taken lightly. This show will make you sit down in amazement, trying to figure out what Lynch was smoking and how you could get some.Lynch and Frost wanted to mix a murder mystery in the form of a police investigation with soap opera elements in order to create a series that was scary and sexy, funny and decadent, mundane and surreal. The mystery of who killed Laura Palmer was going to be the main plot element which - over time - was to gradually recede to the background as other townsfolk and their stories were unfolding. In fact, the murder was never really supposed to be solved, as was actually done half-way through season 2, and the aim for Twin Peaks was to expose the gruesome underbelly of the Leave it to Beaver and apple-pie America.  Thus Twin Peaks was born and the rest, as they say, is TV making legend.Laura had secrets and around those secrets she built a fortress that no one seemed able to penetrate.  Everytime she tried to make the world a better place, something terrible came up inside her and pulled her back down into hell, taking her deeper and deeper into the darkest nightmare and everytime it got harder to go back up to the light. As FBI Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan), with the help of Sheriff Harry S. Truman (!) (Michael Ontkean) and his local law enforcement team set out to solve Laura Palmer's murder and get to the bottom of those secrets, they also tap into the lives of these seemingly ordinary townsfolk who each harbor not only great secrets of their own but also entertain severe dysfunctions on a multitude of levels.It is interesting how Lynch took that picture of the prom queen with the perfect smile and the small, sleepy town she was living in and painted all black over it. As the audience gets to know the people of Twin Peaks and Laura Palmer, it becomes clear that there were terrible secrets and a dark facade hidden underneath that perfect smile and those sad haunting eyes.Twin Peaks is as much about the mystery of this surreal, secluded town, its eerie, mysterious woods and its lurid characters as it is about the life of an American teenager having lost her bearings, entangled in a web of deceit, drugs, promiscuity, crime and sheer terror.By creating Twin Peaks, Lynch ventured into creating a soap opera but of nightmarish proportions. At times it is light as air and mundane, at other times it is terrifying and sinister. We are introduced into a beautiful and sleepy small American town that has, beneath the surface, crossed over into a very real nightmare. As the narrative of Twin Peaks unfolds, we become intensely drawn into the lives and drama of its multifaceted characters and realize that while there is an element of terror in there, there is also familiarity; a bizarre kind of reality that cannot be described easily but can always be felt when entering the world of Twin Peaks.With the revelation of Laura's murderer and the resolving of the main story arc less than halfway through Season 2, the pace changed and the series seemed to drag on a bit only to meet an unsatisfactory cliffhanger ending. Some of the characters began behaving in a way designed to service an extended plot instead of the plot responding to the characters. It was like they let out all the air at once and then suddenly they had about 12 episodes to go with nothing to do, since, after all, the show was mainly about Laura's death and the mysterious circumstances under which she died.The truth about who killed Laura should really have come last, not half way through. The connection Lynch drew between the evil that is lurking in this town and its woods, Laura's death, the concept of the Black and White Lodge and Coop eventually being inhabited by Bob, were brilliant and everything fell together, but the order should have been reversed and the revelation of who murdered Laura and the demise of Cooper should together have made for an explosive finale. Lynch blamed network pressure for the decision to resolve the Palmer storyline prematurely.The possible romantic relationship between Cooper and Audrey was also never resolved and instead they had him more than half way through season 2 fall in love with a random girl named Annie Blackburn (Heather Graham), Norma Jenning's sister. It was an abrupt deviation from a story arc that had so naturally developed over time and was just awaiting its conclusion.The official story for why they did not pursue the romantic storyline between Cooper and Audrey was that MacLachlan himself had objected to the idea because he believed it would have been out of character for Cooper to be falling for a teenager. But the reality seemed to have looked differently, as reportedly Lara Flynn Boyle (Twin Peaks' Donna Hayward), who was dating Kyle MacLachlan at the time, objected to co-star Sherilyn Fenn being paired together with MacLachlan in a series of romantic scenes, especially considering their considerable on-screen chemistry. Boyle seemed to have been further irritated by the fact that Fenn's character Audrey was gaining prominence in the storyline while Boyle's character Donna was given little to work with and had gradually been moved to the background.In a recent interview Finn recalls that David Lynch, by creating Audrey, had ""made a character that got bigger than his original characters that were the important characters [in the show]. And those girls were not happy about it [...] this was supposed to be the Lara Flynn Boyle show."" Finn's increasing popularity on and especially off screen as well as the immense chemistry she and McLachlan had, were apparently too much for Boyle to handle and so it is believed that she pressured McLachlan to convince the writers that a romantic relationship between Cooper and Audrey was out of the question.Of course,  it would not have been out of character for Cooper to have fallen for Audrey; he was only a few years older and it was obvious that he had already fallen for her throughout the show, so following through would have just followed the natural course of how things had been set up. Whatever the reason for it, the abrupt ending of Audrey and Cooper's romantic relationship and the introduction of random love interests for both was probably the worst misstep of the series, creating a disconnect.You might also want to consider readingThe Secret Diary of Laura Palmer, which is a haunting and chilling recollection of her life from the age of 12 up until shortly before her death at 17, telling us, in her own words, about the shattered life of a teenager entangled in a web of deceit, drugs, promiscuity, crime and sheer terror. I thought it was interesting to see that Laura wasn't the victim everyone thought she was but that she, in fact, was also strong and had a dark side to her, with dark desires, that most people wouldn't think a teen like her does or should have. Twin Peaks is as much about the mystery of this surreal, secluded town, its eerie, mysterious woods and its lurid characters as it is about the life of an American teenager having lost her bearings.The ultimate question Twin Peaks poses, and never answers because that is not Lynch's style, is what is that mysterious, evil that lurks in the woods, or the soul of men; is it insanity or evil? What even is insanity, what is evil? When we say someone is a schizophrenic, like the One Armed Man in Twin Peaks, what does that really mean? Did people imagine BOB? Can anyone believe BOB existed given how fantastic the circumstances surrounding his presence seem? As Agent Cooper said ""is it easier to believe a man would rape and murder his own daughter?"" Is it more comforting calling it that and expressing it in terms we understand?Twin Peaks is all about that little space - the line between insanity, evil and the surreal - the very fabric of which things are made, secret kept, actions towards each other informed. because what really is the definition of evil in relation to the human condition? When someone commits an evil act, while others never break the law their entire lives you wonder what separates the latter from the former. Is BOB, as Major Briggs suggests, just the evil men do?In this saga David Lynch is showing us - in his very own peculiar way - that there is more in heaven and earth than is dreamt of in our philosophy...",4,"An Absolute Masterpiece.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[33, 38]","There's hardly anything at all to say about Twin Peaks that hasn't already been said since the show's premiere and demise; both of which occured in what seems like an eternity ago.  For those unfamiliar with the cult show from David Lynch and Mark Frost, Twin Peaks is the story of murdered homecoming queen Laura Palmer (the gorgeous Sheryl Lee), whose body is discovered washed ashore and wrapped in plastic.  FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (Lynch favorite Kyle MacLachlan) is assigned to the case, and what follows is a dizzying, mistifying trip that literally must be seen to be believed.  Featuring an incredibly oddball cast of characters and a dark, sinister tone that underlines the series from beginning to end, Twin Peaks still ranks today as one of the most original, and influential, shows to ever grace network television.  There's no easy answers to be found, and there are plenty of confusing moments, but in the end, everything comes together in an incredibly strange way that is simply beautiful; even if the ending of the series is left unresolved (but picked up upon in the feature film, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, released after the series' demise from New Line, and hence is not featured in this set).  Everyone that populates Twin Peaks leaves their mark, especially MacLachlan as the black coffee and cherry pie loving fed; while the rest of the cast includes Michael Ontkean as Sheriff Harry S. Truman, and features familiar faces like Lara Flynn Boyle, Sherilyn Fenn, Ray Wise, Joan Chen, Lynch favorite Jack ""Eraserhead"" Nance, Miguel Ferrer, a young Heather Graham, Billy Zane, Michael J. Anderson, a pre X-Files David Duchovny (as a trannie FBI Agent no less), and even Lynch himself.  This Definitive Gold Box Edition collects both seasons of the series and a horde of extras (although none of the ones included with the single released second season), as well as Lynch's breathtaking pilot.  The first season is by far the better of the two, with the second season making the big revelation that will either have you with your jaw hanging to the floor or swearing at your television.  Either way you look at it, whether you are a new to town or a returning visitor, Twin Peaks will astound you like no modern network TV show can ever hope to do today.  If you doubt these words, or the words of the other reviews here, take a trip to Twin Peaks and see for yourself.",5,Welcome home,1194393600,"11 7, 2007",2007,2399,"['hardly', 'anything', 'say', 'Twin', 'Peaks', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said', 'show', 'premiere', 'demise', 'occured', 'what', 'eternity', 'ago', 'unfamiliar', 'cult', 'show', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Mark', 'Frost', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'story', 'murdered', 'homecoming', 'queen', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'gorgeous', 'Sheryl', 'Lee', 'body', 'discovered', 'washed', 'ashore', 'wrapped', 'plastic', 'FBI', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Dale', 'Cooper', 'Lynch', 'favorite', 'Kyle', 'MacLachlan', 'assigned', 'case', 'what', 'dizzying', 'mistifying', 'trip', 'literally', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'Featuring', 'incredibly', 'oddball', 'cast', 'characters', 'dark', 'sinister', 'tone', 'series', 'beginning', 'end', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'still', 'today', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'influential', 'ever', 'grace', 'network', 'television', 'easy', 'answers', 'be', 'found', 'are', 'plenty', 'confusing', 'moments', 'end', 'everything', 'together', 'incredibly', 'strange', 'way', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'even', 'ending', 'series', 'left', 'unresolved', 'picked', 'up', 'feature', 'film', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'Fire', 'Walk', 'Me', 'released', 'series', 'demise', 'New', 'Line', 'hence', 'not', 'featured', 'set', 'Everyone', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'mark', 'especially', 'MacLachlan', 'black', 'coffee', 'cherry', 'pie', 'loving', 'fed', 'rest', 'cast', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'Sheriff', 'Harry', 'S.', 'Truman', 'features', 'familiar', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'Sherilyn', 'Fenn', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'Lynch', 'favorite', 'Jack', 'Eraserhead', 'Nance', 'Miguel', 'Ferrer', 'young', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'Michael', 'J.', 'Anderson', 'pre', 'X-Files', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'trannie', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'no', 'less', 'even', 'Lynch', 'Definitive', 'Gold', 'Box', 'Edition', 'seasons', 'series', 'horde', 'extras', 'none', 'ones', 'included', 'single', 'released', 'second', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'Lynch', 'breathtaking', 'pilot', 'first', 'season', 'far', 'better', 'two', 'second', 'season', 'making', 'big', 'revelation', 'will', 'either', 'have', 'jaw', 'hanging', 'floor', 'swearing', 'television', 'way', 'look', 'are', 'new', 'town', 'returning', 'visitor', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'will', 'astound', 'modern', 'network', 'TV', 'show', 'can', 'ever', 'hope', 'do', 'today', 'doubt', 'words', 'words', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'take', 'trip', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'see']",N/A

1097173,A1AST89AHN17O7,B000UX6THK,Omnes,"[1, 1]","When Twin Peaks aired on television, none could have predicted how the murder of Laura Palmer would move not only the town's citizens, who knew Laura as a generous and good-hearted teenager, but also millions of viewers. Indeed, over thirty episodes, they would discover a community of five thousand citizens who hide, behind closed doors and curtains, dangerous secrets. With the investigation done by the FBI agent Dale Cooper and the Twin Peaks sheriff Harry Truman, they uncover those same secrets and try to answer the one-million dollar question.Who killed Laura Palmer?Though the main characters are Agent Dale and Sheriff Truman, Twin Peaks is an ensemble show since each episode narrates a complete day, which includes the lives of Twin Peaks residents, and the Laura Palmer investigation. For each episode, we witness characters' pains and joys of their lives, but we slowly find out that Laura herself was not who she was and that dangerous forces haunt the woods of Twin Peaks. Not only that, we also witness an awesome romance between Audrey Horne and Special Agent Dale Cooper, which gave to its actress Sherilyn Fenn the success she deserved.As such, the show itself can switch emotions very quickly, going from drama to comedy, then towards pure terror. As such, the show is not your usual drama-investigation-soap opera. Even the music that Angelo Badalamenti did completely differs to what was done in the eighties and today. It haunts your heart as tunes like Falling, Audrey's Dance, Laura's Theme, and the Woods' Theme play in the background.Though my favorite characters were Dale Cooper, Audrey Horne, Andy, Lucy, Shelly, the Log Lady, and the whole Palmer family, I have to admit that the most unforgettable remains BOB, played by the excellent Frank Silva, set dresser for the pilot and a David Lynch collaborator whose scenes in the show have spooked me for days. Especially the short ones he did in certain episodes.About the other special Features, I appreciated everything this DVD set offers, although I wish they could have shown the funny Sesame Street parody of Twin Peaks.As a final note, to everybody interested in Twin Peaks, it is important to know that the show's broadcaster, ABC, horribly mistreated the series. As explained in the making of, ABC was uncomfortable with the show narration and shocking content, especially coming from the director who did Blue Velvet, movie that shocked the public and industry with its sexual and sadomasochistic scenes. But what really unsettled the ABC bosses was the sudden popularity of a show that they had no hope in the first place. So they forced the creators to reveal the murderer's identity in the middle of the second season, which they unfortunately did. This was a foolish idea since it hurt the story's plot device and forced the creators to come up with less-spectacular storylines. As such, the Laura Palmer story goes for seventeen episodes (pilot included) and remains the best of what is in Twin Peaks. Of the last thirteen episodes, they feel to me like a jumble of good ideas that don't hit their full potential. Of course, the Windom Earle events are great, but what happens with Little Nicky, James and Irene, and the Pine Weasel doesn't strike the same chord as Laura Palmer's story. And with what happens with the Audrey Horne/Cooper romance, I prefer to stick with the first seventeen episodes who make a complete series by themselves. Speaking of that Audrey Horne/Cooper romance, Kyle MacLachlan explains in the making-of why he asked the storyline to be dropped. However, I tend to believe more the explanations Mark Frost, Bob Engels and Sherilyn Fenn said, especially after seeing on YouTube interviews with Sherilyn Fenn, and the ""2011 Twin Peaks Convention Q&A; Dinner Meeting"", where Sheryl Lee and Lenny Von Dohlen talked about a certain cast member I will not name, but whom they found unpleasant. And to me, I think stopping that plotline due to some behind-the-scenes conflict hurt the show as much as the revelation of Laura Palmer's mystery. Especially since that romance was supposed to be the next major plot line of the second season.So why the Five stars even though I think the last thirteen episodes are not up to par with the first seventeen episodes. Because the setting and universe this series presents remains unique and light-years to what is done on television. It also offered the chance for shows to tell their stories like movies instead of the usual talk-talk in television, and Twin Peaks, even years after its unfair cancellation, still remains in the collective mind of the public, of its fans, and of the industry. Indeed, shows like The X-Files, Lost, Desperate Housewives, Once Upon a Time, Riget, the Killing, movies like The Blair Witch Project, and video games like Alan Wake, Max Payne, and Deadly Premonition owe a lot to Twin Peaks. If there is one thing that makes them different from Twin Peaks, it is that they never repeated the same mistake that Twin Peaks did.God knows what would have happened if the show had been done either in syndication, or on cable channels like HBO who started to bring out excellent series like Tales from the Crypt. Maybe Twin Peaks would have had its third, and probably final season, done.",5,"The most haunting, and mistreated, show in the history of television",1350259200,"10 15, 2012",2012,5268,"['When',

1097179,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000UX6THK,Robert Moore,"[17, 19]","It is almost impossible to overemphasize the importance of TWIN PEAKS in the history of television.  Although the eighties saw enormous strides in Quality Television, beginning with HILL STREET BLUES and continuing with series like CHINA BEACH, ST. ELSEWHERE, and L.A. LAW, none of these series took television took TV to the next level.  To be honest, neither did TWIN PEAKS, since Season Two failed to deliver on the almost dizzying potential shown in Season One, but it clearly revealed television as a medium with more potential than anyone had ever imagined.In my own take on the history of television, the full maturation of serial narrative television comes in four stages, each one represented by four key television series.  Stage One was the debut of HILL STREET BLUES, with its intertwining of multiple story arcs.  Previous to HSB, there had been no critically acclaimed series to leave conflict unresolved each week.  Series worked exclusively in episodic format, wrapping up every major plot detail by the end of each episode, and with all the characters magically forgetting everything that had happened in the week before.  There were multiple reasons for this, one of them being that the pure episodic format allowed networks to repeat episodes in any order, since together they did not tell a story.  But HILL STREET BLUES, while it did not tell very long stories, always had multiple arcs that took 3 to 6 episodes to resolve.  It was a dramatic improvement on previous television narrative.  Stage Two came with TWIN PEAKS and the idea that you could use a series to tell a very, very long story over the course of one or more seasons.  Unfortunately, despite an inconceivably exciting and very short Season One, TWIN PEAKS fell apart in its second season as unresolved mystery was piled on top of a series of other unresolved mysteries.  By the end of Season Two viewers had been given few answers but had been presented with a staggering number of questions.  More on the consequences of this in a bit.  Stage Three was represented by THE X-FILES, which like TWIN PEAKS took a very long story arc over the course of several seasons, as over six years the series told a story of alien colonization and government collusion.  Unlike TWIN PEAKS, the series provided answers, but like TWIN PEAKS it succumbed to internal contradictions and narrative confusions.  As X-FILES creator Chris Carter admitted, they were more or less making up the mythology episodes as they went along.  Also, while Mulder and Scully were riveting characters, the series was insufficiently concerned with character development and more concerned with plot.  The correct blend had not yet been found.  Stage Four came with BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, which perfectly blended long-term character development with very long story arcs.  In developing the series LOST, Damon Lindelhof has stated that their writers would watch TWIN PEAKS and THE X-FILES in order to be aware of the pitfalls befalling long narrative serial dramas and BUFFY to observe the correct balance between narrative and character development.[Usually at this point a BABYLON 5 fan will interject that B5 also introduced a long, character-based narrative into television.  My reply is always that B5 took place in its own little universe, no pun intended.  While THE X-FILES and BUFFY were changing the way TV envisioned the way to handle narrative, B5 was on, but it apparently had little or no influence on any other shows.  I've never been able to discover another series that seems to have been indebted to B5, not even FARSCAPE, which seems to owe far more to BUFFY.  So B5 aside, my point stands.]TWIN PEAKS represented both TV at its best and its worst.  Season One of TWIN PEAKS might be the most perfect season in the history of television.  It was only a few episodes long, but each episode was more exciting than watching most movies.  Prior to TWIN PEAKS all television was about talk.  The focus of every show was on people standing around talking.  Ironically for a visual medium, the visual was curiously unimportant.  MIAMI VICE had anticipated many of the achievements of TWIN PEAKS by bringing the purely visual and aural elements of television to the forefront and by making silence -- mainly through the long, pregnant, almost overwhelming pauses of Edward James Olmos -- a significant part of the surface of television.  But TWIN PEAKS made the specifically visual and aural elements of the show critically important in a way never before seen on TV.  It was more like watching ballet than viewing anything else that had ever before appeared on the small screen.  Unfortunately, all the magnificence of Season One was rapidly destroyed by the increasingly incoherent and self-indulgent second season.  Not that there were not some wonderful moments in the second season, but more and more as the season went on, at least toward the end when Lynch and Frost seem to have realized that things had gone too far, the show devolved into chaos.  Still, the genie was out of the bottle.  Regardless of what the show became in Season Two, Season One had already altered the history of television.TWIN PEAKS is also, more than any other series, responsible for introducing surrealism into prime time.  Although NORTHERN EXPOSURE (which was filmed only a few miles away from where TWIN PEAKS was -- the two series in fact featured opposite sides of the same mountain range in their background shots -- NORTHERN EXPOSURE also made an explicit shout out to TWIN PEAKS near the end of its first season) started off odd, it didn't become truly surreal until after TWIN PEAKS enormous success.  Without the magnificent strangeness of TWIN PEAKS we might never have gotten the oddity that we found in shows like ALLY McBEAL.Famously, the reason we have never seen a complete collection of TWIN PEAKS before was that the rights to the pilot was held by a different production company.  An oddly truncated edition of Season One was briefly available, but without the initial, and utterly glorious, pilot, it just didn't seem right.  The pilot was available separately, but the quality was so low as to be more irritating than satisfying.  Now we will finally get the entire series together in one wonderful set.",5,Finally!

Most of us hardcore fans were used to watching the horrible VHS version with his unprecedented lack of clarity and color balance. This is truly Twin Peaks like you've never seen it before.In this ten-disc set, you get all the episodes, the pilot, and a nice selection of extras. The pilot is available in both the domestic version, and the extended international version. The Log Lady intros are available, but they don't seem to have been remastered and are somewhat fuzzy.I've heard a number of complains about the sound, usually regarding the music covering dialogue. Lynch is absolutely meticulous with his sound design, which leads me to believe that the balance is no accident. In Twin Peaks, the music is almost another character itself. While it IS more forward in the mix than what we're used to, Lynch clearly feels that it's important enough to put it in the foreground at times.The extras are all pretty decent and informative, but I would have liked some episode commentaries and other features that we usually find on TV show DVDs. Lynch is no fan of commentary tracks, but seeing as his involvement with the entirety of Twin Peaks is, at times, periphery, I thought there might have been a chance for some of the other directors involved to step in and tell a few stories.Overall, it's an essential purchase for all Lynch fans, and probably for anyone who likes weird, but great television.",5,Twin Peaks in stunning clarity,1215302400,"07 6, 2008",2008,1532,"['Finally', 'finally', 'finally', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'available', 'DVD', 'not', 'only', 'been', 'remastered', 'amazing', 'Most', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'were', 'used', 'watching', 'horrible', 'VHS', 'version', 'unprecedented', 'lack', 'clarity', 'color', 'balance', 'truly', 'Twin', 'Peaks', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before.In', 'ten-disc', 'set', 'get', 'episodes', 'pilot', 'nice', 'selection', 'extras', 'pilot', 'available', 'domestic', 'version', 'extended', 'international', 'version', 'Log', 'Lady', 'intros', 'are', 'available', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'remastered', 'are', 'somewhat', 'fuzzy.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'number', 'complains', 'sound', 'usually', 'regarding', 'music', 'covering', 'dialogue', 'Lynch', 'absolutely', 'meticulous', 'sound', 'design', 'believe', 'balance', 'accident', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'music', 'almost', 'character', 'more', 'forward', 'mix', 'what', ""'re"", 'used', 'Lynch', 'clearly', 'important', 'enough', 'put', 'foreground', 'times.The', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'decent', 'informative', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'episode', 'commentaries', 'other', 'features', 'usually', 'find', 'TV', 'show', 'DVDs', 'Lynch', 'fan', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'seeing', 'involvement', 'entirety', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'times', 'periphery', 'thought', 'there', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'chance', 'other', 'directors', 'involved', 'step', 'tell', 'few', 'stories.Overall', 'essential', 'purchase', 'Lynch', 'fans', 'probably', 'anyone', 'who', 'weird', 'great', 'television']",N/A

The complete series (yes, including the Log-Lady introductions) is complemented by a great feature-length making-of documentary, deleted scenes, post cards, and yes, the recipe for the fabled cherry pie from the Double-R Diner.  As a fan of the series, it's hard to be disappointed with all the extras this collection has.TWIN PEAKS focuses on a small town's reaction to the grisly murder of the high-school's homecoming queen.  The chain of events that this sets into motion are strange, humorous, horrifying, and dreamy.  Fans of the X-FILES, THE KILLING, and LOST will find that this show's influences are wide and far reaching.  I'm not quite sure this show is for everyone though; there are times when the story grinds to a halt, melodramatic and self-aware romances feel like soap operas, and things just don't make logical sense.  These elements will probably annoy people, but for others, it's what gives TWIN PEAKS its quirky unique charm.  This Gold Box Edition is recommended for both newbies to the TWIN PEAKS world and to veterans of the show who weathered through the season 1 and 2 DVDs.  The updates here are definitely worth the price of admission to justify repurchasing this content.My chief complaint with this set is that although the picture quality has been improved over the original Season 1 and Season 2 DVDs, it's still not quite great.  As of this review, Netflix Instant has this series available to stream in its entirety.  The quality in this streaming option is noticeably improved over what is contained here.

1097192,A3VAXB8CDYY5BG,B000UX6THK,The Wingchair Critic,"[5, 8]","'Twin Peaks: The Definitive Gold Box Edition' (2007) offers viewers both the American and European versions of the pilot film and every episode of the landmark television series, which debuted in 1990 to rave reviews and briefly became a cultural phenomenon in the United States. 'Twin Peaks' famously inspired a number of television series in the 1990s, including 'Northern Exposure' (1990-1995), 'Eerie, Indiana' (1991-1992), 'Picket Fences' (1992-1996) and 'The X-Files' (1993-2002).Centered around the mysterious murder of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), a teenage prom queen in the small northwestern town of Twin Peaks, the first season, which was meticulously overseen by filmmaker and co-creator David Lynch, is a surreal mosaic of Jungian psychology, literalized metaphor, violence, demonology, incest, and folksy, deadpan humor. Like Lynch's earlier groundbreaking film 'Blue Velvet' (1986), the series can be concisely summed up in a single line provided by Laura's secret lover, biker James Hurley (James Marshall): ""Everyone's hurt inside.""There's no doubt that the first season and those portions of the second which deal with the Palmer killing remain some of the most suspenseful, riveting, and surprising drama ever aired on American television. As incest was not a prominent theme in primetime television drama in that era, 'Twin Peaks' further pushed the envelope of what the networks considered acceptable.However, Lynch moved on to other creative projects between the first and second seasons, and once Palmer's murderer was finally identified and brought to justice, 'Twin Peaks' simply fell spectacularly and painfully apart.An abundance of unnecessary new characters were introduced, and established characters like James, Bobby (Dana Ashbrook), Josie (Joan Chen) and Leo (Erik Da Re) were so badly written that they were no longer recognizable or appealing. The extended storyline in which Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer) becomes obsessed with recreating the Civil War in miniature is excruciatingly banal, and the decision to have Audrey (Sherilyn Fenn) and Bobby, the attractive rebels of the first season, become young career professionals was a woeful mistake indeed.The show's previously crisp and carefully balanced directorial tone collapsed with the writing, leaving fine actors like Kyle MacLachlan, Peggy Lipton, and Michael Ontkean looking hesitant, disoriented and embarrassed. The concluding episodes of the second season can rightfully be seen as an unintential parody of the gripping first season.Not surprisingly, both MacLachlan and Fenn publicly expressed their anger at Lynch's unexpected departure as creative overseer, and the series was abruptly cancelled in 1991, leaving at least one key plot unsolved.'Twin Peaks' also brought a number of technical innovations to American television. One has only to compare a random episode to any episode of 'L.A. Law' (1986-1994), for example, to observe the enormous positive shift in production values that Lynch and co-creator Mark Frost instituted. As has been frequently noted, each episode is like a short high-quality film, with immaculate set design, costuming, lightning, photography, editing, and scoring.The highly varied cast included Lynch favorites Jack Nance, Grace Zabriskie, and MacLachlan, older stars of film and television like Jane Greer, Piper Laurie, Beymer, Lipton and Ontkean, and a plethora of talented newcomers like Lara Flynn Boyle, Madchen Amick, and David Duchovny in addition to Lee, Marshall, Fenn, and Ashbrook.Perhaps the show's abrupt cancellation was a difficult pill for Lynch to swallow: in 1992, he wrote and directed 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,' a feature-length film which explored the last several days in the life of Laura Palmer, who had already been murdered as the pilot film opened. A critical and commercial failure upon release, the film features a flat, sober tone throughout, an incredibly moody score by Angelo Badalamenti,  and one of the grimmest endings in all of cinema, but one which would be outdone by the conclusion of Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' (2001), which remains Lynch's most nihilistic cinematic work to date.",4,Stumbling Through Some Dark Places,1194480000,"11 8, 2007",2007,4162,"[""'Twin"", 'Peaks', 'Definitive', 'Gold', 'Box', 'Edition', '2007', 'viewers', 'American', 'European', 'versions', 'pilot', 'film', 'episode', 'landmark', 'television', 'series', 'debuted', '1990', 'rave', 'reviews', 'briefly', 'became', 'cultural', 'phenomenon', 'United', 'States', ""'Twin"", 'Peaks', 'famously', 'inspired', 'number', 'television', 'series', '1990s', 'including', ""'Northern"", 'Exposure', '1990-1995', ""'Eerie"", 'Indiana', '1991-1992', 'Fences', '1992-1996', 'X-Files', '1993-2002', '.Centered', 'mysterious', 'murder', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'Sheryl', 'Lee', 'teenage', 'prom', 'queen', 'small', 'northwestern', 'town', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'meticulously', 'overseen', 'filmmaker', 'co-creator', 'David', 'Lynch', 'surreal', 'mosaic', 'Jungian', 'psychology', 'literalized', 'metaphor', 'violence', 'demonology', 'incest', 'folksy', 'deadpan', 'humor', 'Lynch', 'earlier', 'groundbreaking', 'film', 'Velvet', '1986', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'concisely', 'summed', 'up', 'single', 'line', 'provided', 'Laura', 'secret', 'lover', 'biker', 'James', 'Hurley', 'James', 'Marshall', 'Everyone', 'hurt', 'inside', 'doubt', 'first', 'season', 'portions', 'second', 'deal', 'Palmer', 'killing', 'remain', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'riveting', 'surprising', 'drama', 'ever', 'aired', 'American', 'television', 'incest', 'was', 'not', 'prominent', 'theme', 'primetime', 'television', 'drama', 'era', 'Peaks', 'further', 'pushed', 'envelope', 'what', 'networks', 'considered', 'acceptable.However', 'Lynch', 'moved', 'other', 'creative', 'projects', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'once', 'Palmer', 'murderer', 'was', 'finally', 'identified', 'brought', 'justice', 'Peaks', 'simply', 'fell', 'spectacularly', 'painfully', 'apart.An', 'abundance', 'unnecessary', 'new', 'characters', 'were', 'introduced', 'established', 'characters', 'James', 'Bobby', 'Dana', 'Ashbrook', 'Josie', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'Leo', 'Erik', 'Da', 'Re', 'were', 'so', 'badly', 'written', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'recognizable', 'appealing', 'extended', 'storyline', 'Benjamin', 'Horne', 'Richard', 'Beymer', 'obsessed', 'recreating', 'Civil', 'War', 'miniature', 'excruciatingly', 'banal', 'decision', 'have', 'Audrey', 'Sherilyn', 'Fenn', 'Bobby', 'attractive', 'rebels', 'first', 'season', 'become', 'young', 'career', 'professionals', 'was', 'woeful', 'mistake', 'indeed.The', 'show', 'previously', 'crisp', 'carefully', 'balanced', 'directorial', 'tone', 'collapsed', 'writing', 'leaving', 'fine', 'actors', 'Kyle', 'MacLachlan', 'Peggy', 'Lipton', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'looking', 'hesitant', 'disoriented', 'embarrassed', 'concluding', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'can', 'rightfully', 'be', 'seen', 'unintential', 'parody', 'gripping', 'first', 'season.Not', 'surprisingly', 'MacLachlan', 'Fenn', 'publicly', 'expressed', 'anger', 'Lynch', 'unexpected', 'departure', 'creative', 'overseer', 'series', 'was', 'abruptly', 'cancelled', '1991', 'leaving', 'least', 'one', 'key', 'plot', 'unsolved', ""'Twin"", 'Peaks', 'also', 'brought', 'number', 'technical', 'innovations', 'American', 'television', 'One', 'only', 'compare', 'random', 'episode', 'episode', 'L.A', 'Law', '1986-1994', 'example', 'observe', 'enormous', 'positive', 'shift', 'production', 'values', 'Lynch', 'co-creator', 'Mark', 'Frost', 'instituted', 'been', 'frequently', 'noted', 'episode', 'short', 'high-quality', 'film', 'immaculate', 'set', 'design', 'costuming', 'lightning', 'photography', 'editing', 'scoring.The', 'highly', 'varied', 'cast', 'included', 'Lynch', 'favorites', 'Jack', 'Nance', 'Grace', 'Zabriskie', 'MacLachlan', 'older', 'stars', 'film', 'television', 'Jane', 'Greer', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'Beymer', 'Lipton', 'Ontkean', 'plethora', 'talented', 'newcomers', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'Madchen', 'Amick', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'addition', 'Lee', 'Marshall', 'Fenn', 'Ashbrook.Perhaps', 'show', 'abrupt', 'cancellation', 'was', 'difficult', 'pill', 'Lynch', 'swallow', '1992', 'wrote', 'directed', ""'Twin"", 'Peaks', 'Fire', 'Walk', 'Me', 'feature-length', 'film', 'explored', 'last', 'several', 'days', 'life', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'who', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'murdered', 'pilot', 'film', 'opened', 'critical', 'commercial', 'failure', 'release', 'film', 'flat', 'sober', 'tone', 'incredibly', 'moody', 'score', 'Angelo', 'Badalamenti', 'one', 'grimmest', 'endings', 'cinema', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'outdone', 'conclusion', 'Lynch', ""'Mulholland"", 'Drive', '2001', 'Lynch', 'most', 'nihilistic', 'cinematic', 'work', 'date']",N/A

I have seen people refer to this TV series from the 90's and I was curious whether it was worth watching.  I had questions about why would he do only one TV series?  If it was so great, why did it only have two seasons?  I watch a lot of older movies but almost never TV this old.  I don't like a lot of the current TV so would I really enjoy TV from 20 years ago?To answer the above, it was excellent and well worth a purchase.  This reminds me of how I felt aboutFirefly - The Complete Series.  I watched it years after the series had ended and was shocked by how good it was.  With Firefly, I felt that the series was consistently excellent.  It was pruned way before its prime.  Twin Peaks had an amazing first season but some points in the second season were a bit of a let down to me.  From what I've read online, it appears that Lynch and company had less of a role in the second season but came back towards the end.I started watching it on a weekend and I couldn't stop.  I fell in love with the characters and the story.  I can see why people still talk about this series 20 years after the making.  This series didn't feel dated at all because you are fully immersed in the world of Twin Peaks.  I still prefer Lynch's movies but don't discount this because it is a TV series.Even though I loved this series and couldn't put it down, I'm struggling to make it through the movie,Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me.  I watched part of it and stopped it which I rarely do in a movie.  It doesn't have the same appeal or feel that the series had.

Created from new high definintion transfers, ""Twin Peaks"" looks marvelous. This is the ultimate edition for the entire run of the original series and includes the European theatrical cut of the pilot which included an ending shot specifically for that market. This edition could only be surpassed by a Blu-ray edition of the series which, hopefully, CBS is in the process of putting together.The bad news is that the commentary tracks that were on the original first season set (now out of print) that didn't include the pilot are not included as part of this set due to licensing issues associated with them. We do get, however, a terrific set of extras that makes up for the missing commentary tracks. We get the following special features:1) ""The Log Lady Introductions""-Originally shot for the show when it was aired on The Mystery Channel2) Recently discovered deleted scenes3) ""Secrets from Another Place""-A feature length documentary on the making of the series from origin to its cult status.4) ""Return to Twin Peaks""-We follow a group of devoted ""Twin Peaks"" fans as they explore the shooting locations of the original series.5) ""Saturday Night Live"" excerpts-Kyle's monologue from his stint hosting SNL plus the ""Twin Peaks"" parody from the episode.6) ""Falling"" music video as well as bumpers, on-air promos for the series and an interactive map for the locations of the show.7) A packet of postcards and other assorted odds and ends related to the TV series are included.The Look of the show--A beautifully remastered picture for all the episodes and the series is presented pillar boxed in its original aspect ratio.

We don't get an episode ""guide"" like the original boxed set had but aside from those two missing items, this is about as complete a set as we'll ever see for the series.Highly recommended.Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me",5,"""Twin Peaks"" on DVD-better than a piece of Norma's cherry pie and coffee",1193529600,"10 28, 2007",2007,2329,"['Tasting', 'better', 'cherry', 'pie', 'cup', 'coffee', 'groundbreaking', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'finally', 'original', 'pilot', 'movie', 'first', 'second', 'season', 'one', 'exceptionally', 'remastered', 'set', 'Created', 'new', 'high', 'definintion', 'transfers', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'marvelous', 'ultimate', 'edition', 'entire', 'run', 'original', 'series', 'European', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'pilot', 'included', 'ending', 'shot', 'specifically', 'market', 'edition', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'surpassed', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'series', 'hopefully', 'CBS', 'process', 'putting', 'together.The', 'bad', 'news', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'were', 'original', 'first', 'season', 'set', 'now', 'print', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'pilot', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'part', 'set', 'due', 'licensing', 'issues', 'associated', 'do', 'get', 'however', 'terrific', 'set', 'extras', 'up', 'missing', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'get', 'following', 'special', 'features:1', 'Log', 'Lady', 'Introductions', '-Originally', 'shot', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'aired', 'Mystery', 'Channel2', 'Recently', 'discovered', 'deleted', 'scenes3', 'Secrets', 'Place', '-A', 'feature', 'length', 'documentary', 'making', 'series', 'origin', 'cult', 'status.4', 'Return', 'Twin', 'Peaks', '-We', 'follow', 'group', 'devoted', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'fans', 'explore', 'shooting', 'locations', 'original', 'series.5', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'excerpts-Kyle', 'monologue', 'stint', 'hosting', 'SNL', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'parody', 'episode.6', 'Falling', 'music', 'video', 'as', 'well', 'bumpers', 'on-air', 'promos', 'series', 'interactive', 'map', 'locations', 'show.7', 'packet', 'postcards', 'other', 'assorted', 'odds', 'ends', 'related', 'TV', 'series', 'are', 'included.The', 'Look', 'show', 'beautifully', 'remastered', 'picture', 'episodes', 'series', 'presented', 'pillar', 'boxed', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Colors', 'are', 'rich', 'skin', 'tones', 'bit', 'hot', 'was', 'part', 'look', 'original', 'show.The', 'Big', 'Picture', 'exceptional', 'set', 'marred', 'only', 'lack', 'inclusion', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'First', 'Season', 'Artisan', 'boxed', 'set', 'came', 'out', 'decade', 'ago', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'episode', 'guide', 'original', 'boxed', 'set', 'had', 'aside', 'two', 'missing', 'items', 'about', 'complete', 'set', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'series.Highly', 'recommended.Twin', 'Peaks', 'Fire', 'Walk', 'Me']",N/A
