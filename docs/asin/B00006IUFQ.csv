Being from the 1980s and not having been remastered at all, it looks pretty terrible.  Even if they had cleaned up the transfer, which they didn't, it would still look bad in comparison to today's animation because of its age.  The art is simplistic at best, and there were a LOT of shortcuts taken in the animation (still frames show up a lot).  Then there's the Americanization--new intros, endings, and commercial breaks were thrown together from existing footage, with new text typed over them.  These look especially bad, with the text all pixelated and the footage even grainier than the show.  The music also leaves much to be desired, mostly because of the time it was made in and the fact that it is a cartoon.  Think ""Superfriends"" and ""Scooby Doo"" and you're pretty much right on.But, don't go thinking it's all bad, because it's not.  The underlying story is actually pretty good.  The voice acting is also decent for the most part, and many of the actors who got their start with Robotech have gone on to do a lot of famous voice work, even still working today.  Another good thing is that even when it was originally aired, the content was not edited as heavily as some of the more modern anime shows are.  Dragonball Z has a lot of the violence and language removed, for example, to the point where major plot points are lost.  Robotech, while edited creatively by Carl Macek, takes a much more mature approach and realizes that sometimes in war, people do die.With so many disks available in this one package for such a relatively low price, this is really the only way to get it.",3,"If you're going to get Robotech/Macross, get this one",1041292800,"12 31, 2002",2002,1718,"['Obviously', 'lot', 'reviews', 'are', 'fueled', 'nostalgia', 'Anyone', 'who', 'show', 'great', 'fooling', 'Being', '1980s', 'not', 'having', 'been', 'remastered', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'Even', 'had', 'cleaned', 'up', 'transfer', 'did', ""n't"", 'would', 'still', 'look', 'bad', 'comparison', 'today', 'animation', 'age', 'art', 'simplistic', 'best', 'were', 'LOT', 'shortcuts', 'taken', 'animation', 'still', 'show', 'up', 'lot', 'Then', 'Americanization', 'new', 'intros', 'endings', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'were', 'thrown', 'together', 'existing', 'footage', 'new', 'text', 'typed', 'look', 'especially', 'bad', 'text', 'pixelated', 'footage', 'even', 'grainier', 'show', 'music', 'also', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'mostly', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'fact', 'cartoon', 'Think', 'Superfriends', 'Scooby', 'Doo', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'much', 'right', 'on.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'thinking', 'bad', 'not', 'underlying', 'story', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'voice', 'acting', 'also', 'decent', 'most', 'part', 'many', 'actors', 'who', 'got', 'start', 'Robotech', 'have', 'gone', 'do', 'lot', 'famous', 'voice', 'work', 'even', 'still', 'working', 'today', 'good', 'thing', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'aired', 'content', 'was', 'not', 'edited', 'as', 'heavily', 'more', 'modern', 'anime', 'shows', 'are', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'lot', 'violence', 'language', 'removed', 'example', 'point', 'where', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'lost', 'Robotech', 'edited', 'creatively', 'Carl', 'Macek', 'much', 'more', 'mature', 'approach', 'sometimes', 'war', 'people', 'do', 'die.With', 'so', 'many', 'disks', 'available', 'one', 'package', 'relatively', 'low', 'price', 'really', 'only', 'way', 'get']",Robotech - The Macross Saga - Complete Collection

Kim ""A great man should die as a shattered...","[215, 216]","With a stroke of success in the 80's, the Robotech: Macross series still has a place for many fans today and shares a strong cult following.  Being a fan of the series as a kid, I decided to buy the whole Robotech: Macross series, but I came across the overwelming amount of editions to the series.  I didn't know which to buy, so I watched them all.  Here are the differences between to different boxsets (all offered through Amazon):Robotech: the Complete Macross SeriesOne Boxset: 6 discSells for around $60-$65Nothing special, picture quality is not great, but bearable.  Comes in one compact boxset with all the disc in it.  Would not reccomend getting this edition unless you just want a copy of the series and want to spend the least possible amount of money.Robotech: The Legacy Collection: Macross Saga (Collections 1-3)Three Boxsets: with 3 disc in eachSells for around $40 each boxset, entire set around $120-$130Same picture quality as the above set, but with addtional features.  Comes with the most extras out of any current sets, but even then, they are so-so.  I would actually recommend getting the above edition as I was not impressed with the extras, some were interesting, but it definately didn't justify the price.  Your paying almost twice the price.Robotech Remastered: The Macross Saga (Volumes 1-3)Three Boxsets: Two disc each boxsetSells for around $25 each boxset, entire set around $75-$80Remastered picture quality superior to both sets above, sound quality much improved.  This is the set that I would recommend.  The price is affordable and well worth the extra money compared to the first set.  Also includes a few bonus footage.Macross: Super Dimensional Fortress (Sets 1-3)Three Boxsets: Three discs each boxsetSells for around $60-$70 each boxset, entire series around $180-200Macross is the original Japanese series of the Robotech: Macross Saga.  The storyline is slightly different with different music and sounds.  When it was brought to the US, Harmony Gold added the Macross material with two other Japanese series to make Robotech.  Macross is more &quot;mature&quot; and includes several scenes taken out of Robotech.  Picture quality is even more crisp than the Remastered Series.  I would reccomend only to die-hard Robotech fans.

Yes, the animation itself wasn't so impressive, but the synchronization between the American voice overs and Japanese mouths actually go together well.the main plot is not anything new, but it's well told and amazingly threaded together.  (especially considering this is a translated piece, from the original Japanese series, Macross Mosepeda).  If any young writers or movie-script writers want to learn about how to make plots and subplots work--this is the anime show to see!the characters are moving, and they actually grow, unlike many cartoons and or anime.  I mean, the main hero, Rick Hunter was a brash 19 year old from the beginning of the series; and turned into a serious, take-charge ace pilot when he turned older.  IT was believable and incredibly well thought out.  The range of emotions from each charater (even the minor ones) make you believe they are fully human beings.  The voice acting projects it to the point where it enhances their movements and emotions already.The action, of course, is intense, and creative.  Every scene you would wish to replay and pause just to see how many ships were blown up, or what's the ""score"" count of the invariable human and Zentrani aces.The typical romance plot, however sickening to watch as a kid, was convicing and deeply sad.  I felt most sorry for Minmei, but I am glad Lisa Hayes found someone to love her.The best thing about Robotech is, the music.  Each scene, chacter literally had its own score.  Each alien had its own theme, Carl Macek and the music director got it right--whenever someone sits down to WATCH something, the MUSIC has to be as intense as the show itself.  (that's why Star Wars, and Indiana Jones will always be remembered too).The down side of course, is that the plot of the ""robotechnology"" and ""Flowers of Life"" could have been explained further in detail and with more ease.But, besides that, it's well worth the money and as a kid in the 80s brings back a lot of memories.I wish I could give this a 10 star rating.",5,by far the best anime in the 80s (and American translated),1160697600,"10 13, 2006",2006,2069,"['Robotech', 'far', 'most', 'complete', 'anime', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Yes', 'animation', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'impressive', 'synchronization', 'American', 'voice', 'overs', 'Japanese', 'mouths', 'actually', 'go', 'together', 'well.the', 'main', 'plot', 'not', 'anything', 'new', 'well', 'told', 'amazingly', 'threaded', 'together', 'especially', 'considering', 'translated', 'piece', 'original', 'Japanese', 'series', 'Macross', 'Mosepeda', 'young', 'writers', 'movie-script', 'writers', 'want', 'learn', 'how', 'make', 'plots', 'subplots', 'work', 'anime', 'show', 'see', 'characters', 'are', 'moving', 'actually', 'grow', 'many', 'cartoons', 'anime', 'mean', 'main', 'hero', 'Rick', 'Hunter', 'was', 'brash', '19', 'year', 'old', 'beginning', 'series', 'turned', 'serious', 'take-charge', 'ace', 'pilot', 'when', 'turned', 'older', 'IT', 'was', 'believable', 'incredibly', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'range', 'emotions', 'charater', 'even', 'minor', 'ones', 'make', 'believe', 'are', 'fully', 'human', 'beings', 'voice', 'acting', 'projects', 'point', 'where', 'movements', 'emotions', 'already.The', 'action', 'course', 'intense', 'creative', 'scene', 'would', 'wish', 'replay', 'pause', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'ships', 'were', 'blown', 'up', 'what', 'score', 'count', 'invariable', 'human', 'Zentrani', 'aces.The', 'typical', 'romance', 'plot', 'however', 'sickening', 'watch', 'kid', 'was', 'convicing', 'deeply', 'sad', 'felt', 'most', 'sorry', 'Minmei', 'am', 'glad', 'Lisa', 'Hayes', 'found', 'someone', 'love', 'her.The', 'best', 'thing', 'Robotech', 'music', 'scene', 'chacter', 'literally', 'had', 'own', 'score', 'alien', 'had', 'own', 'theme', 'Carl', 'Macek', 'music', 'director', 'got', 'right', 'whenever', 'someone', 'down', 'WATCH', 'something', 'MUSIC', 'be', 'as', 'intense', 'show', 'why', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'too', '.The', 'down', 'side', 'course', 'plot', 'robotechnology', 'Flowers', 'Life', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'explained', 'further', 'detail', 'more', 'ease.But', 'well', 'money', 'kid', '80s', 'brings', 'back', 'lot', 'memories.I', 'wish', 'could', 'give', '10', 'star', 'rating']",Robotech - The Macross Saga - Complete Collection

716903,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B00006IUFQ,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[3, 3]","When people think of classic anime, they often think of the old space-opera epics that pioneered the now huge Mecha genre. And when you think of the Mecha clasics there are two series which very often come to mind. One of them was the first what would become known as the Gundam Legacy, the original Mobile Suit Gundam. The other is what was to become the first part of what we Americans call Robotech. THE MACROSS SAGA.What is the Macross Saga? It is many things. It is the story of race of giant warriors from another part of the universe who attack earth in order to get back their missing super-space-fortress. It's the story of that ship and her crew who must continually fight a war with this alien race merely to survive. And it's the story of Rick Hunter, who does for this series what Christopher Blair did for Wing Commander. He's just an ordinary guy put in extraordinary circumstances, surrounded by a bunch of stange characters, and forced repeatedly to become a hero in a war that he knows is pointless.Some of the episodes are great, some of them aren't so great. And the show definitely lags a bit toward the end. But the battles are spectacular, the music is classic, and most of the voice acting is memorable (it's not Shakespeare, but I'm not complaining). The singing...well it was fine the first hundred times I heard ""To be in love"", but after that...sometimes you just wish they had left in the japanese singing, it couldn't have possibly been worse than this.Anyways, this series features some truly memorable moments, some nicely stylized animation, and a darn cool plot. It gets to be a little too soap-opera style at times, but if you're a die-hard anime fan you're used ot that by now. The music is great, the singing is not. And if you start to get bored toward the end, have patience. Every great Saga has a showdown, and this one delivers in spades.In conclusion, every anime-fan should own this Saga. It's fun, it's entertaining and it's a classic by anyone's standards. And of course the reason why I started watching the show on dvd in the first place was: it's a really great price for anime on dvd, especially at six episodes to a dvd!",5,Every Saga has Boxed Set...,1037836800,"11 21, 2002",2002,2171,"['When', 'people', 'think', 'classic', 'anime', 'often', 'think', 'old', 'space-opera', 'epics', 'pioneered', 'now', 'huge', 'Mecha', 'genre', 'when', 'think', 'Mecha', 'clasics', 'are', 'two', 'series', 'very', 'often', 'come', 'mind', 'One', 'was', 'first', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'known', 'Gundam', 'Legacy', 'original', 'Mobile', 'Suit', 'Gundam', 'other', 'what', 'was', 'become', 'first', 'part', 'what', 'Americans', 'call', 'Robotech', 'THE', 'MACROSS', 'SAGA.What', 'Macross', 'Saga', 'many', 'things', 'story', 'race', 'giant', 'warriors', 'part', 'universe', 'who', 'attack', 'earth', 'order', 'get', 'back', 'missing', 'super-space-fortress', 'story', 'ship', 'crew', 'who', 'must', 'continually', 'fight', 'war', 'alien', 'race', 'merely', 'survive', 'story', 'Rick', 'Hunter', 'who', 'series', 'what', 'Christopher', 'Blair', 'did', 'Wing', 'Commander', 'just', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'put', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'surrounded', 'bunch', 'stange', 'characters', 'forced', 'repeatedly', 'become', 'hero', 'war', 'pointless.Some', 'episodes', 'are', 'great', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'great', 'show', 'definitely', 'bit', 'end', 'battles', 'are', 'spectacular', 'music', 'classic', 'most', 'voice', 'acting', 'memorable', 'not', 'Shakespeare', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'singing', 'well', 'was', 'fine', 'first', 'hundred', 'times', 'heard', 'be', 'love', 'sometimes', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'left', 'japanese', 'singing', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'possibly', 'been', 'worse', 'this.Anyways', 'series', 'truly', 'memorable', 'moments', 'nicely', 'stylized', 'animation', 'darn', 'cool', 'plot', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'soap-opera', 'style', 'times', ""'re"", 'die-hard', 'anime', 'fan', ""'re"", 'used', 'now', 'music', 'great', 'singing', 'not', 'start', 'get', 'bored', 'end', 'have', 'patience', 'Every', 'great', 'Saga', 'showdown', 'one', 'delivers', 'spades.In', 'conclusion', 'anime-fan', 'should', 'own', 'Saga', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'classic', 'anyone', 'standards', 'course', 'reason', 'why', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'dvd', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'price', 'anime', 'dvd', 'especially', 'six', 'episodes', 'dvd']",Robotech - The Macross Saga - Complete Collection
