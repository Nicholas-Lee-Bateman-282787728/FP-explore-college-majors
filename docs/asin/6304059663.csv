Children can watch them & you can't say that about a lot of the movies on the market.  I highly recommend these movies.,5,Gunsmoke: Long Ride,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,263,"['Gunsmoke', 'movies', 'are', 'terrific', 'simply', 'love', 'James', 'Arness', 'Gunsmoke', 'movies', 'are', 'always', 'tastefully', 'done', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Children', 'can', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'about', 'lot', 'movies', 'market', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movies']",Gunsmoke:Long Ride VHS
399110,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,6304059663,Israel Drazin,"[1, 1]","Matt Dillon is a retired US Marshal attending his daughter's wedding when two sheriff deputies ride up to arrest him for a murder and robbery. He is identified as the culprit by a man he once jailed. He is unable to prove his innocence because the local sheriff has been shot, is recuperating, and is indecisive. The district judge is no help because he is out of town and will not return for a week. The town people are riled up by the murdered man's son and come to hang him. Dillon rushes out of town in search of the real killers. He finds out that three men were involved in the robbery. He is pursued by a posse led by the murdered man's son who wants revenge. Dillon finds one of the three men who was left by the other two because he was badly wounded. His leg is infected by gangrene. Dillon saves his life by cutting off his leg. He finds the other two men and has to kill one of them in self defense. He captures the third man, but he too is killed trying to escape. Dillon's only hope to clear himself is the man he saved by cutting off his leg. He needs to bring him back alive and he needs to avoid Indians and the posse that is determined to bring him in dead.",5,This western has a good plot that is developed well,1294012800,"01 3, 2011",2011,1175,"['Matt', 'Dillon', 'retired', 'US', 'Marshal', 'attending', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'when', 'two', 'sheriff', 'deputies', 'ride', 'up', 'arrest', 'murder', 'robbery', 'identified', 'culprit', 'man', 'once', 'jailed', 'unable', 'prove', 'innocence', 'local', 'sheriff', 'been', 'shot', 'recuperating', 'indecisive', 'district', 'judge', 'help', 'town', 'will', 'not', 'return', 'week', 'town', 'people', 'are', 'riled', 'up', 'murdered', 'man', 'son', 'come', 'hang', 'Dillon', 'town', 'search', 'real', 'killers', 'out', 'three', 'men', 'were', 'involved', 'robbery', 'pursued', 'posse', 'led', 'murdered', 'man', 'son', 'who', 'revenge', 'Dillon', 'one', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'was', 'left', 'other', 'two', 'was', 'badly', 'wounded', 'leg', 'infected', 'gangrene', 'Dillon', 'life', 'cutting', 'off', 'leg', 'other', 'two', 'men', 'kill', 'one', 'self', 'defense', 'third', 'man', 'too', 'killed', 'trying', 'escape', 'Dillon', 'only', 'hope', 'clear', 'man', 'saved', 'cutting', 'off', 'leg', 'bring', 'back', 'alive', 'avoid', 'Indians', 'posse', 'determined', 'bring', 'dead']",Gunsmoke:Long Ride VHS

399112,A1MPPAKA7VJO3P,6304059663,Pop culture man,"[1, 1]","This engrossing movie has all the features of the best Westerns: taut dialogue, realistic action, great use of landscape and a script that allows character to develop while maintaining a high level of action. An aged James Arness convinces as a man still formidable with his fists and his guns despite his years and the supporting cast, including some charismatic bad men, is also very good. There are strong messages in the film about justice, goodness, the love of family, friendship and redemption. The violence is starkly portrayed and at times shocking. Some scenes will make the viewer's emotions flow and others drip with tension. Watch this and you will ride with the retired Marshall on every step of his journey.
