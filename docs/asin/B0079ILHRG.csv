Each episode is a tiny morality play that can be quite thought provoking. There are some serious considerations on the values and mores of the time period and we can enjoy the very different perspectives while being thoroughly entertained. There are numerous 'take offs' like the ""Murdoch Identity"" which is an homage to the Borne Identity and ""Mild Mild West"" for ""Wild Wild West"" in which we can observe early scientific discoveries we now take for granted.

But if you think the investigative methods used then were all very primitive, think again. Detective William Murdoch and his cohorts on the Toronto Constabulary (police force) employ ""finger marks"" (fingerprinting), dye on paper money to catch a bank robber, phone tapping, autopsies and other techniques to catch killers. Murdoch isn't afraid to push the envelope, even building contraptions to aid in his detecting work. Working alongside him is coroner Dr. Julia Ogden, Murdoch's former lover who now is seemingly out of reach. You'll see plenty of yearning looks from Murdoch when he works with Dr. Ogden, and one great fantasy scene when he actually does something about it.Murdoch is a thoroughly decent fellow who crosses himself when he sees a body and always does his best to be polite. This is my first viewing of this series -- I haven't seen the first three seasons -- so at first I found him a bit too wooden, even for Victorian times. Gradually, though, I began to see the storm of emotion under that stalwart (and very handsome) exterior, and I was hooked.The 13 episodes in this set run the gamut, from attacks by what appears to be a vampire to a visit with an autistic woman -- they called them ""idiot savants"" in those days -- whose construction of an exact scale replica of her street uncovers a murder that she didn't have the verbal skills to tell anyone about. There's a primitive gun silencer in one episode and a sort of witness protection plan in another.There's a great cliffhanger at the end of the season that leaves several loose ends waving in the breeze.

In the investigation of their crimes Murdoch's scientific dabblings lead him to develop tools and methods to aid the investigations which include everything from using coal dust to recover &#34;finger marks&#34; to devising a machine to monitor sound waves underwater (sonar). Allow his inability to express his love to his colleague, pathologist Dr. Julia Ogden (also very cutting edge for her time) is the frustrating undertone of the series.  The characters of the Toronto Constabulary are lovable and quirky. And although the topic of murder is not funny and the series is not a comedy, it does take a lighter aire and does not have the blood, guts and violence of most crime dramas.
