Yelling, going back & forth etc...A little too much generically, real to be entertaining. I parented teens,so been there, done that, don't need or want to revisit that ! I skipped ahead in the movie & the plot moved on predictably, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but what was presented wasn't very engaging.Also, Oddly, there was the same song, over, & over, OVER again throughout the movie...& not one sung by the girl, but by a guy...the story is about, Grace, so they should have had at least a girl singer, especially since the actress playing Grace DOES sing ! The bulk of the story was a depressing cautionary tale, but you know there's a happy ending. I'd like to see a story about people who make good choices for the right reasons because they have seen what the consequences are second hand. A redemptive story is nice, but this seemed mostly depressing until the end.

Even those in ministry don't have a &#34;magic formula&#34; to raise their children and with all the outside influences these days it is a battleground much of the time because neither side is willing to actually communicate.  I found the movie very real because without seeing any situation through the eyes of Christ, it is a battle of flesh and blood and that is a losing battle.

This is a quality movie with a great and heartening message in the midst of a fallen and lost world. Good music as well. Christian movies like this one get the expected poor treatment by the MSM for obvious reasons, but blessings come through persecution - that we know. We also know that when a movie gets this kind of criticism from the world that the movie's message must be right on target after all. Keep on keeping on. There's a great prize that awaits. I highly recommend this movie, and am thankful for it and others like it. Keep em coming.I do want to add, though, that the only element I saw lacking in the movie came in the Christian characters frequently seeming to be shy in expressing and explaining their decisions and their faith to the non-believers in the movie. The dad, for instance, turning down the offer for a new recording deal without clearly explaining why to Mossy. Also, there were some missed opportunities to clarify for people the difference between religion and having a relationship with Jesus. Nonetheless the overall message of the movie was clearly expressed, and it is a very important one indeed. It still merits five stars in my view.",5,Quality movie.,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,1359,"['Mainstream', 'movie', 'reviewers', 'give', 'movie', 'weak', 'reviews', 'sing', 'praises', 'Hollywood', 'standard', 'fare', 'involving', 'profanity', 'sex', 'drugs', 'blood', 'violence', 'general', 'perversity', 'quality', 'movie', 'great', 'heartening', 'message', 'midst', 'fallen', 'lost', 'world', 'Good', 'music', 'well', 'Christian', 'movies', 'one', 'get', 'expected', 'poor', 'treatment', 'MSM', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'blessings', 'come', 'persecution', 'know', 'also', 'know', 'when', 'movie', 'kind', 'criticism', 'world', 'movie', 'message', 'must', 'be', 'right', 'target', 'Keep', 'keeping', 'great', 'prize', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'am', 'thankful', 'others', 'Keep', 'em', 'coming.I', 'do', 'want', 'add', 'though', 'only', 'element', 'saw', 'lacking', 'movie', 'came', 'Christian', 'characters', 'frequently', 'seeming', 'be', 'shy', 'expressing', 'explaining', 'decisions', 'faith', 'non-believers', 'movie', 'dad', 'instance', 'turning', 'down', 'offer', 'new', 'recording', 'deal', 'clearly', 'explaining', 'why', 'Mossy', 'Also', 'were', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'clarify', 'people', 'difference', 'religion', 'having', 'relationship', 'Jesus', 'overall', 'message', 'movie', 'was', 'clearly', 'expressed', 'very', 'important', 'one', 'indeed', 'still', 'five', 'stars', 'view']",Grace Unplugged
