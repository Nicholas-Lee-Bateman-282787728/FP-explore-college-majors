It is an excellent adaptation. The only major difference was very personal to me, but it works anyway. If you're a looking for answers to your spiritual life, this will complete the journey. There will always be questions, but there are always answers as well. This helps you understand not only the questions, but that you are not along and that there is an answer.",5,Perfect Stranger completes the Perfect Adaptation.,1386460800,"12 8, 2013",2013,448,"['final', 'installment', 'David', 'Gregory', 'books', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'only', 'major', 'difference', 'was', 'very', 'personal', 'anyway', ""'re"", 'looking', 'answers', 'spiritual', 'life', 'will', 'complete', 'journey', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'questions', 'are', 'always', 'answers', 'as', 'well', 'understand', 'not', 'only', 'questions', 'are', 'not', 'along', 'answer']",Nikki and the Perfect Stranger: Perfect Stranger 3
1682743,A9WACRR33WN3U,B00GXW0CUM,Chloe,"[3, 3]","This was the third and final in a series of books by David Gregory, and the screenplay by Mr. Moore.  I loved the first movie, it was moving, emotional with a beautiful ending!  The second was good, I enjoyed it.  We were waiting with bated breath for this final in the series.  i don't kinow how the book is, but the movie was a little disappointing.  I didn't find the actress they choose to be as convincing as the first Nikki.  However, the meaning of Christ's mission, and questions that loom for the average Christian were all spot on and that was gripping as usual. We enjoyed seeing the Pastor from the Perfect gift, and getting the update about his life...that was an unexpected pleasure!I love Mr. Moore's portrayl of Christ, he is phenomenal, regardless of the script, and so for that alone, I'd say it's worth a look-see.  Along with the Biblical teachings of Christ, which is never boring but exciting and peaceful at once.  I hope Mr. Moore does another film portraying Christ, perhaps another visit to the town from ""PERFECT GIFT"" which was our all time favorite!  God bless~",4,A little disappointed- Moore was fantastic as always!,1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,1090,"['was', 'third', 'final', 'series', 'books', 'David', 'Gregory', 'screenplay', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'loved', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'moving', 'emotional', 'beautiful', 'ending', 'second', 'was', 'good', 'enjoyed', 'were', 'waiting', 'bated', 'breath', 'final', 'series', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'kinow', 'how', 'book', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'disappointing', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'actress', 'choose', 'be', 'as', 'convincing', 'first', 'Nikki', 'However', 'meaning', 'Christ', 'mission', 'questions', 'loom', 'average', 'Christian', 'were', 'spot', 'was', 'gripping', 'as', 'usual', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Pastor', 'Perfect', 'gift', 'getting', 'update', 'life', 'was', 'unexpected', 'pleasure', 'love', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'portrayl', 'Christ', 'phenomenal', 'regardless', 'script', 'so', 'alone', ""'d"", 'say', 'look-see', 'Biblical', 'teachings', 'Christ', 'never', 'boring', 'exciting', 'peaceful', 'once', 'hope', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'film', 'portraying', 'Christ', 'perhaps', 'visit', 'town', 'PERFECT', 'GIFT', 'was', 'time', 'favorite', 'God', 'bless~']",Nikki and the Perfect Stranger: Perfect Stranger 3
