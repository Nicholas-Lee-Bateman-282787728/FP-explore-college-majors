1354619,A2582KMXLK2P06,B003N3I422,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","King of the Avenue is a strange, strange movie.  It's about Vin Rhames playing the role of the devils helper coming back for revenge to eliminate everyone he sees fit.At first it seems like another ordinary drug dealer-type storyline involving gang leaders, punks and troublemakers, but then... this element of supernatural forces just APPEARS out of nowhere.  Vin Rhames' taking out the bad guys occupies a good portion of the storyline.It's definitely quite unusual, but hey, at least it's a slight spin on the typical gang leader/drug dealer storylines that have been beaten into the ground by this point in several other movies, however it becomes REALLY far-fetched and as a result, hard to tolerate.Plus, maybe it's just me, but there's quite a bit of swearing in this film.  My favorite segment is the one where Vin Rhames' character comes out of nowhere and shoots an entire gang.  Talk about a VERY bloody and particularly violent segment this one is!Overall, not much of a film unless you don't mind the far-fetched factor and the plentiful amount of cuss words that occupy King of the Avenue.",3,king of the oddness,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,1103,"['King', 'Avenue', 'strange', 'strange', 'movie', 'Vin', 'Rhames', 'playing', 'role', 'devils', 'helper', 'coming', 'back', 'revenge', 'eliminate', 'everyone', 'fit.At', 'first', 'ordinary', 'drug', 'dealer-type', 'storyline', 'involving', 'gang', 'leaders', 'punks', 'troublemakers', 'then', 'element', 'supernatural', 'forces', 'just', 'APPEARS', 'nowhere', 'Vin', 'Rhames', 'taking', 'out', 'bad', 'guys', 'good', 'portion', 'storyline.It', 'definitely', 'quite', 'unusual', 'hey', 'least', 'slight', 'spin', 'typical', 'gang', 'leader/drug', 'dealer', 'storylines', 'have', 'been', 'beaten', 'ground', 'point', 'several', 'other', 'movies', 'however', 'REALLY', 'far-fetched', 'result', 'hard', 'tolerate.Plus', 'maybe', 'just', 'quite', 'bit', 'swearing', 'film', 'favorite', 'segment', 'one', 'where', 'Vin', 'Rhames', 'character', 'nowhere', 'shoots', 'entire', 'gang', 'Talk', 'VERY', 'bloody', 'particularly', 'violent', 'segment', 'one', 'Overall', 'not', 'much', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'far-fetched', 'factor', 'plentiful', 'amount', 'cuss', 'words', 'occupy', 'King', 'Avenue']",King of the Avenue

Webb ""love to groove""","[2, 2]","I at first thought that oh another kill or be killed drug dealer film well I was half right this movie is about battles amoungst dealers but with a twist. Vin Rhames plays the dead father of the lead character who comes back from the dead at Satans request as a demon,and brings death and destruction to those who are in the game to gain leadership of the trade.

1354621,A35FC3DWA1M79H,B003N3I422,Christopher,"[1, 1]","I saw this film called Dirty Kopz a few years back when someone let me borrow the tape.  I thought that it was serious, low-budget and not made well - but it turned out to be an underground classic to me!  It as funny, but somewhat serious, but the comedy did not knock you in the head, it just came at you when you least expected it to.With that, I was looking for more!  I assume that the guy who made Dirty Kopz (Ryan Combs) also made this one too.  Seems like it the way this plays out except that the budget is higher (by low budget standards).  This is about a guy who wants to be the ""king of the avenue"" at any cost and makes a deal with the devil.  I will not give it away, but in the end the film has a good messege after all of the carnage.  I like the way the comedy comes into play with the film.  It never says that it is a comedy, but it slaps you in the face when it comes!  This is funnier than most comedies!  It is not as funy as Dirty Kopz, but it is similar.I reccomend that everyone pick this up if nothing else then to see it.

1354625,A1NLO4JVLEGGRJ,B003N3I422,New York Horror Reader,"[6, 6]","A little indie that was competently directed by Ryan Combs.  With mostly solid talent in front of the camera King of the Avenue is a low budget, eerie, violent, and dreamy little work of art. The Story is not a new one, but the direction, Faustian story, and characterizations are all top notch.  The story is of a young boy who was adopted by his mother's boyfriend, a notorious gangster, after she died.  He grew up in an environment of violence and feels it is his destiny to continue the legacy of his father. It echos familiar movies such as Boys in the hood, or Menace to Society, but has a unique take on the formula.  The budget is the real restriction on this movie because you get the feeling Combs wanted it to be more, just had to deal with what he got...he chooses his shots well, and the editing helps to create what is missing in terms of budget.Without a doubt though, this movie is carried by the actors.  Simon Rex is fun to watch and hits the spot with his portrayal of a white urban male trying to live up to modern urban masculine mythology and manifesting his own destiny through terror and violence with no regard of it's over all impact.  Ving Rames in a dual role took me awhile to warm up to, but he delivers.  Acted in an unassuming and brutal manner he brings the nightmares behind the dreams of success to a sudden reality.  Esai Morales makes a quick cameo as the prince of darkness, he does well but lack of budget shows in the overall product.  Erick Nathan as Cal was the hip break out unknown for me.  His delivery is sharp and believable, a major support for an overall solid cast.An overall indictment of greed and blind determination this film comes at you in expected ways and then turns you on your head.  A bloody story of ambition, greed, love, lust, betrayal, and the other asskickeries of movie making.  King of the Avenue is a smooth and sexy, yet violent and dreadful urban fairytale that should not be missed.",4,"A smooth and sexy, yet violent and dreadful urban fairytale.",1287446400,"10 19, 2010",2010,1955,"['little', 'indie', 'was', 'competently', 'directed', 'Ryan', 'Combs', 'mostly', 'solid', 'talent', 'front', 'camera', 'King', 'Avenue', 'low', 'budget', 'eerie', 'violent', 'dreamy', 'little', 'work', 'art', 'Story', 'not', 'new', 'one', 'direction', 'Faustian', 'story', 'characterizations', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'story', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'adopted', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'notorious', 'gangster', 'died', 'grew', 'up', 'environment', 'violence', 'feels', 'destiny', 'continue', 'legacy', 'father', 'familiar', 'movies', 'such', 'Boys', 'hood', 'Menace', 'Society', 'unique', 'take', 'formula', 'budget', 'real', 'restriction', 'movie', 'get', 'feeling', 'Combs', 'wanted', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'had', 'deal', 'what', 'got', 'shots', 'well', 'editing', 'create', 'what', 'missing', 'terms', 'budget.Without', 'doubt', 'movie', 'carried', 'actors', 'Simon', 'Rex', 'fun', 'watch', 'spot', 'portrayal', 'white', 'urban', 'male', 'trying', 'live', 'up', 'modern', 'urban', 'masculine', 'mythology', 'manifesting', 'own', 'destiny', 'terror', 'violence', 'regard', 'impact', 'Ving', 'Rames', 'dual', 'role', 'took', 'awhile', 'warm', 'up', 'Acted', 'unassuming', 'brutal', 'manner', 'nightmares', 'dreams', 'success', 'sudden', 'reality', 'Esai', 'Morales', 'quick', 'cameo', 'prince', 'darkness', 'well', 'lack', 'budget', 'shows', 'overall', 'product', 'Erick', 'Nathan', 'Cal', 'was', 'hip', 'break', 'out', 'unknown', 'delivery', 'sharp', 'believable', 'major', 'support', 'overall', 'solid', 'cast.An', 'overall', 'indictment', 'greed', 'blind', 'determination', 'film', 'expected', 'ways', 'then', 'head', 'bloody', 'story', 'ambition', 'greed', 'love', 'lust', 'betrayal', 'other', 'asskickeries', 'movie', 'making', 'King', 'Avenue', 'smooth', 'sexy', 'violent', 'dreadful', 'urban', 'fairytale', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",King of the Avenue
