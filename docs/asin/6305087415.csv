I finally got around to see ""The Big One"" this weekend. I felt like I could really relate to Michael's disdain for corporate America having had spent time working for a major corporation myself. I could relate to the employees of various corporations who have continually gotten screwed over by the corporate machine. I think it is hilarious how Random House tried to reign in Michael's shenanigans during his book tour with their escorts. While there are lots of hilarious moments when Michael tries to confront various company CEOs on why they are laying off their employees when they are making a good amount of cash, there is also a good mix of drama.One of my favorite moments in the film was when Michael went to the capital in Wisconsin to talk to then Governor Tommy Thompson about his welfare reform policies with two women who were living below poverty level. Apparently the new welfare reform policy Tommy signed when he was governor doesn't work for everyone. I love the politician Michael and the women confront in the state capital was the equivalent of a snake oil salesman, no one was buying his schpiel because those women went through the process of the new welfare reform and they were still living below poverty.One of the most personal and touching moments was when Michael was at a book signing at Borders' bookstore and one of the people in line was a woman who was recently laid off from Ford co.. I was moved by Michael's concern for the woman. I also liked his conversations with other people like the diners in Iowa (I think) and just getting their overall opinions on the presidential election in '92.Like his other films, ""The Big One"" mixes biting satirical humor with real-life drama.

Even his best movie, ""Bowling for Columbine,"" is, at essence, a collection of vignettes but informed by an overall questing sensibility.  Why do we like our guns?  With that being understood, why are we so violent with them?Well, Charlie Chaplin described the essence of acting as having a good entrance and a good exit.In this film, the entrance is a national tour, meant to discover the real America via interview and question-and-answer sessions in meeting halls.Moore is using, roughly, a technique the unions used to favor for organizing.  Even the unions, though, from hard experience, came to learn that this method was not producing results.It's a quaint technique, filled with sentimental attraction, but it does not work any more.  We've been purged of that kind of attention span by entertainment and information access.The exit?  Moore claims credit for successfully organizing union bargaining units at two Borders locations.  He does a standup talking about how hypocritical big business is by insisting on free enterprise, when they do not themselves believe in it.  He is drinking a bottle of Evian water.  Evian is bottled in France.  Moore will not drink anything but Evian and if a different (American-bottled) brand is furnished, he will refuse to speak.His sad exit.  I like the fact that he expresses a point of view not heard enough in our country, but he abuses the privilege his success has conferred on him.  Like the corrupt union bosses in the 1950s, he, too, has fallen prey to the temptations of success.Yesterday (7/9/2005), I visited the Borders store in West Des Moines that Moore takes credit for organizing.  The movie depicts this as a triumph.  The checkout lady confirmed that this was the Borders store in the movie, but that it is now non-union.  She asked around, and only one out of the entire store staff on hand even remembered that a union represented these employees at one time.  She said that the union was decertified over a year ago because they never bargained a first contract, and was doing nothing at all for the employees.Does this sound like Michael Moore himself?",3,"An Entrance, An Exit",1116720000,"05 22, 2005",2005,2181,"['Moore', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'whole', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'Even', 'best', 'movie', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'essence', 'collection', 'vignettes', 'informed', 'overall', 'questing', 'sensibility', 'Why', 'do', 'like', 'guns', 'being', 'understood', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'violent', 'Well', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'described', 'essence', 'acting', 'having', 'good', 'entrance', 'good', 'exit.In', 'film', 'entrance', 'national', 'tour', 'meant', 'discover', 'real', 'America', 'interview', 'question-and-answer', 'sessions', 'meeting', 'halls.Moore', 'using', 'roughly', 'technique', 'unions', 'used', 'favor', 'organizing', 'Even', 'unions', 'though', 'hard', 'experience', 'came', 'learn', 'method', 'was', 'not', 'producing', 'results.It', 'quaint', 'technique', 'filled', 'sentimental', 'attraction', 'not', 'work', 'more', ""'ve"", 'been', 'purged', 'kind', 'attention', 'span', 'entertainment', 'information', 'access.The', 'exit', 'Moore', 'credit', 'successfully', 'organizing', 'union', 'bargaining', 'units', 'two', 'Borders', 'locations', 'standup', 'talking', 'how', 'hypocritical', 'big', 'business', 'insisting', 'free', 'enterprise', 'when', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'drinking', 'bottle', 'Evian', 'water', 'Evian', 'bottled', 'France', 'Moore', 'will', 'not', 'drink', 'anything', 'Evian', 'different', 'American-bottled', 'brand', 'furnished', 'will', 'refuse', 'speak.His', 'sad', 'exit', 'fact', 'point', 'view', 'not', 'heard', 'enough', 'country', 'privilege', 'success', 'conferred', 'corrupt', 'union', 'bosses', '1950s', 'too', 'fallen', 'prey', 'temptations', 'success.Yesterday', '7/9/2005', 'visited', 'Borders', 'store', 'West', 'Des', 'Moines', 'Moore', 'credit', 'organizing', 'movie', 'triumph', 'checkout', 'lady', 'confirmed', 'was', 'Borders', 'store', 'movie', 'now', 'non-union', 'asked', 'around', 'only', 'one', 'entire', 'store', 'staff', 'hand', 'even', 'remembered', 'union', 'represented', 'employees', 'one', 'time', 'said', 'union', 'was', 'decertified', 'year', 'ago', 'never', 'bargained', 'first', 'contract', 'was', 'doing', 'nothing', 'employees.Does', 'sound', 'Michael', 'Moore']",N/A
448026,A1P2NBM3P3TS2X,6305087415,"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[40, 49]","Like Moore's earlier film &quot;Roger and Me&quot;, &quot;The Big One&quot; (Moore's tongue-in-cheek term for the large, all-encompassing corporate bohemoth that this country may eventually become) takes a disturbing yet often comical look at how Big Business is running roughshod over whatever is left of Corporate Responsibility in this country.This film is alternatingly funny and deeply depressing.  Mainly, however, you want to shake Moore's hand for having the chutzpah to shove a microphone and camera in Corporate America's faces and demand they explain their &quot;outsourcing&quot; actions directly to the faithful and long-term employees (generations of them, in some cases) who were unceremoniously dumped in favor of cheaper overseas or over-the-border labor.These large corporations are selling America off piece by piece, in a way.  They are giddily happy to lay off American workers by the thousands to make a few extra bucks, line their pockets a bit more, or hasten their Golden Parachute paydays.Sure, a primary function of a business is to make money.  But when doing so to such excess involves actions that could undermine America's already fragile socio-economic fabric on a relatively grand scale, then it becomes an issue of Conscience.  Moore, like many of us, realizes this.  Moore rushes up to the Corporate Big Dogs (or at least the highest-ranking ones he can find or the nearest media outlet he can find) and asks the questions we wish we could ask  -- he expresses the common-man outrage we wish we could express.  We all have motive, but Moore has motive AND opportunity.Few of his theatrics will actually result in actual change, but perhaps they serve a higher purpose:  to get us to wake up and realize that all is not well in America, that Big Business is making DAMN sure that the economic chasms between the haves and the have-nots will continue to expand, and that YOUR JOB IS NEVER, EVER GOING TO BE SAFE.  The days of working for the same company from college 'til the day you retire are all but over.  Your job can be taken away from you AT ANY TIME as soon as the powers-that-be at XYZ Corporation figure out that it can be economically profitable to throw your entire town out of work.And the attendant problems that go with massive layoffs:  increases in crime, suicides, etc....  Well, sorry!  You should have gone to Harvard Business School, got an MBA or something, and snagged one of those rare, hard-to-get jobs where you just show up, meet with your Accounting, Finance, and Legal Departments, and start divvying up the pie you are about to share.Enron, Worldcom, Pillsbury, Nike...... they aren't unique in their business practices.

Surprisingly enough the big boss of Nike (who make all their shoes in Indonesia) is willing to speak to Moore, leading to an awkward but honest converstation.It's not Moore's best work, Roger and Me and Bowling for Columbine are better and funnier and more revolting too.

Michael Moore, in this movie, attacks the profit motive and seems to indicate that corporations ought to settle for lower profits, in exchange for raising their employee's sallaries.  Michael Moore fails to realize that unprofitable companies, or corporations with low profit margins, are even less able to pay their employee's the wages they seek.I found this film problematic for a number of reasons.  First, one does not have to live in an area where there is one employer in the entire town.  If one chooses to live in such an area, and this area is economically depressed, they should do what any reasonable person would do: move.  Second, it is unreasonable to expect that the limited skills one has...will suffice for the entire duration of their life.  Sometimes one has to learn new skills if they want to maintain employable.  To think that the nation has to stand still simply because some people do not have the proper skills is unreasonable.  Ever hear of a city college?  Try one.  You can get new skills.  One does not need to lobby Congress or be a complainer.  Instead, I'd recommend 1) going to a location that is hiring and 2) getting some new skills.  You can't lose if you do both.",2,"Michael Moore, as usual, is wrong.",1107043200,"01 30, 2005",2005,1318,"[""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'corporation', 'liberals', 'lose', 'rationality', 'common', 'sense', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'movie', 'profit', 'motive', 'indicate', 'corporations', 'ought', 'settle', 'lower', 'profits', 'exchange', 'raising', 'employee', 'sallaries', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'realize', 'unprofitable', 'companies', 'corporations', 'low', 'profit', 'margins', 'are', 'even', 'less', 'able', 'pay', 'employee', 'wages', 'seek.I', 'found', 'film', 'problematic', 'number', 'reasons', 'First', 'one', 'not', 'have', 'live', 'area', 'where', 'one', 'employer', 'entire', 'town', 'one', 'live', 'such', 'area', 'area', 'economically', 'depressed', 'should', 'do', 'what', 'reasonable', 'person', 'would', 'do', 'move', 'Second', 'unreasonable', 'expect', 'limited', 'skills', 'one', 'will', 'suffice', 'entire', 'duration', 'life', 'Sometimes', 'one', 'learn', 'new', 'skills', 'want', 'maintain', 'employable', 'think', 'nation', 'stand', 'still', 'simply', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'proper', 'skills', 'unreasonable', 'Ever', 'hear', 'city', 'college', 'Try', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'new', 'skills', 'One', 'not', 'need', 'lobby', 'Congress', 'be', 'complainer', 'Instead', ""'d"", 'recommend', '1', 'going', 'location', 'hiring', '2', 'getting', 'new', 'skills', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lose', 'do']",N/A

448035,AOSQ5JIA2X4M,6305087415,"""rrr338""","[20, 26]","Let me start by saying that this film has many brilliant, provocative moments.  I greatly admire Moore's spunk and persistence in skewering his deserving targets -- America's major corporations and their supporters.  However, this is somewhat disappointing on the heels of Moore's first  effort &quot;Roger and Me.&quot;  The main reason, I think, is because  &quot;Roger&quot; had much more focus, and served as an interesting case  study of how one corporation callously ignores human needs.Michael  Moore obviously tries to keep on the same track with this film, but it is  obvious that he(probably unknowingly) unerestimated the way in which too  much comic appeal can trivialize important issues. There are too many  scenes with Moore doing his &quot;stand-up&quot; comic routine; not enough  ones to highlight the hypocrisy of the corporate brass. It is interesting  that Phil Knight, CEO at Nike, agrees to talk with Moore on camrera.  I  think it's because he is clever enough to realize that Moore had, at this  time, already leaned so far in the direction of comedy, that nothing said  would seriously register with the movie audience. (In fact, Knight comes  across as a likable though misguided &quot;straight man&quot; for Moore).  That's the disappointing element here.  For most viewers, this will be a  good laugh, and then it's back to exploitation of American workers as  usual. Still, one hopes that there are enough out there who will, after  laughing, say to themselves, &quot;This is funny, but what's happening in  America isn't.  Something has to be done.&quot;",3,"Funny, important, but getting off-target",954288000,"03 29, 2000",2000,1585,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'film', 'many', 'brilliant', 'provocative', 'moments', 'greatly', 'admire', 'Moore', 'spunk', 'persistence', 'skewering', 'deserving', 'targets', 'America', 'major', 'corporations', 'supporters', 'However', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'heels', 'Moore', 'first', 'effort', 'quot', 'Roger', 'Me.', 'quot', 'main', 'reason', 'think', 'quot', 'Roger', 'quot', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'focus', 'served', 'interesting', 'case', 'study', 'how', 'one', 'corporation', 'callously', 'human', 'needs.Michael', 'Moore', 'obviously', 'keep', 'same', 'track', 'film', 'obvious', 'probably', 'unknowingly', 'unerestimated', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'comic', 'appeal', 'can', 'trivialize', 'important', 'issues', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'Moore', 'doing', 'quot', 'stand-up', 'quot', 'comic', 'routine', 'not', 'enough', 'ones', 'highlight', 'hypocrisy', 'corporate', 'brass', 'interesting', 'Phil', 'Knight', 'CEO', 'Nike', 'talk', 'Moore', 'camrera', 'think', 'clever', 'enough', 'realize', 'Moore', 'had', 'time', 'already', 'leaned', 'so', 'far', 'direction', 'comedy', 'nothing', 'said', 'would', 'seriously', 'register', 'movie', 'audience', 'fact', 'Knight', 'across', 'likable', 'misguided', 'quot', 'straight', 'man', 'quot', 'Moore', 'disappointing', 'element', 'here', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'laugh', 'then', 'back', 'exploitation', 'American', 'workers', 'usual', 'Still', 'one', 'are', 'enough', 'who', 'will', 'laughing', 'say', 'quot', 'funny', 'what', 'happening', 'America', ""n't"", 'Something', 'be', 'done.', 'quot']",N/A
