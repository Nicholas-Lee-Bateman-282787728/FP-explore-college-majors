I suppose in an era without fancy special effects in movies, the Internet, cell phones and other distractions that keep us occupied today, these things were a lot more magical. And yet I'M NO DUMMY reminds you of where this business has been with the great pioneers of the art form that has sadly seen a decline in the 21st Century.Thankfully we have some very talented people carrying the torch for ventriloquism in the modern age like Jeff Dunham, Jay Johnson and others who tell their behind the scenes story about how they got interested in doing this as their career. You really get the sense that about 3-4 people inspired a whole new generation of would-be ventriloquists and after watching this DVD you'll be hopeful that the next generation of ventriloquists are being inspired even now. The end of I'M NO DUMMY left you wondering about the future of this industry and there were mixed reactions. Jeff Dunham said it best when he noted that audiences just want to laugh and be entertained and that performers need to keep their act current to stay relevant (something he does brilliantly).Classic clips of ventriloquism are sprinkled throughout this DVD which makes it a treasure trove for ventriloquist junkies. When you watch the old school performers doing their thing, you realize how enormously talented they really were. No wonder people wanted to see these acts over and over again in person and on The Ed Sullivan Show. The only thing missing from this fine documentary-styled fIlm was the inclusion of one of the biggest breakthrough acts on the Las Vegas strip who made his name winning America's Got Talent as a ventriloquist--Terry Fador. Sure, they mentioned him in the closing credits, but he should have been right up there with Dunham, Johnson, etal.If you're a fan of ventriloquism and want to get to know your favorite performers past and present on a more intimate level, then get I'M NO DUMMY.",5,Go Behind The Scenes Of Your Favorite Dummy (And Their Puppets Too!),1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,2007,"['Ever', 'was', 'child', '80', 'was', 'fascinated', 'puppets', 'ventriloquism', 'suppose', 'era', 'fancy', 'special', 'effects', 'movies', 'Internet', 'cell', 'phones', 'other', 'distractions', 'keep', 'occupied', 'today', 'things', 'were', 'lot', 'more', 'magical', 'yet', ""'M"", 'DUMMY', 'where', 'business', 'been', 'great', 'pioneers', 'art', 'form', 'sadly', 'seen', 'decline', '21st', 'Century.Thankfully', 'have', 'very', 'talented', 'people', 'carrying', 'torch', 'ventriloquism', 'modern', 'age', 'Jeff', 'Dunham', 'Jay', 'Johnson', 'others', 'who', 'tell', 'scenes', 'story', 'how', 'got', 'interested', 'doing', 'career', 'really', 'get', 'sense', '3-4', 'people', 'inspired', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'would-be', 'ventriloquists', 'watching', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hopeful', 'next', 'generation', 'ventriloquists', 'are', 'being', 'inspired', 'even', 'now', 'end', ""'M"", 'DUMMY', 'left', 'wondering', 'future', 'industry', 'were', 'mixed', 'reactions', 'Jeff', 'Dunham', 'said', 'best', 'when', 'noted', 'audiences', 'just', 'want', 'laugh', 'be', 'entertained', 'performers', 'need', 'keep', 'act', 'current', 'stay', 'relevant', 'something', 'brilliantly', '.Classic', 'clips', 'ventriloquism', 'are', 'sprinkled', 'DVD', 'treasure', 'trove', 'ventriloquist', 'junkies', 'When', 'watch', 'old', 'school', 'performers', 'doing', 'thing', 'realize', 'how', 'enormously', 'talented', 'really', 'were', 'wonder', 'people', 'wanted', 'see', 'acts', 'over', 'again', 'person', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'Show', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'fine', 'documentary-styled', 'fIlm', 'was', 'inclusion', 'one', 'biggest', 'breakthrough', 'acts', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'strip', 'who', 'made', 'name', 'winning', 'America', 'Got', 'Talent', 'ventriloquist', 'Terry', 'Fador', 'Sure', 'mentioned', 'closing', 'credits', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'there', 'Dunham', 'Johnson', 'etal.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'ventriloquism', 'want', 'get', 'know', 'favorite', 'performers', 'past', 'present', 'more', 'intimate', 'level', 'then', 'get', ""'M"", 'NO', 'DUMMY']",N/A

1318014,A3PJDIVV4J0THA,B0031U8OGI,Say No More 67,"[2, 2]","This is a very well made 86 minutes documentary about ventriloquism and ventriloquists.It's NOT(!) a compilation of complete Jeff Dunham and other ventriloquists' sketches, and anyone looking for such a DVD should pick other available titles, otherwise you'll end up giving it an unjustifiable bad review as so many who failed to read the product description have done here.The film contains interviews with many ventriloquists, including Jeff Dunham, Jay Johnson (Chuck & Bob from Soap) and Lynn Trefzger, along with less known ones and with vent historian Tom Ladshaw.It serves as a tribute to the pillars of this astonishing form of art, including archive footage as early as the 1930's.The format is roughly :a short interview (thankfully interviewee only) followed by a short excerpt of a sketch that illustrates the points discussed by the interviewee.Very good job done by the editor/producer/director.Some of the archive footage is understandably in low B&W; quality, but still enjoyable and serves the purpose of the film.My only complaint, and thus the 4 star rating, is the total lack of subtitles.In many parts of the DVD this is a real drawback, where audio is not as clear as in regular DVD's, both because of the nature of this art form, and the archive footage quality.The 2 Q&A; panels at the bonus part of the DVD are barely audible, and I could hardly understand a word even after increasing the volume more than twofold. Subtitles would have made this a perfect 5 stars product. Pity it's still not a standard feature on DVD productions.Bottom line - highly recommended to anyone who wants to delve a bit in this fascinating art form.",4,"Worthy, insightful and well made tribute to ventriloquism and ventriloquists",1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,1654,"['very', 'well', 'made', '86', 'minutes', 'documentary', 'ventriloquism', 'ventriloquists.It', 'NOT', 'compilation', 'complete', 'Jeff', 'Dunham', 'other', 'ventriloquists', 'sketches', 'anyone', 'looking', 'DVD', 'should', 'pick', 'other', 'available', 'titles', 'otherwise', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'giving', 'unjustifiable', 'bad', 'review', 'so', 'many', 'who', 'failed', 'read', 'product', 'description', 'have', 'done', 'here.The', 'film', 'interviews', 'many', 'ventriloquists', 'including', 'Jeff', 'Dunham', 'Jay', 'Johnson', 'Chuck', 'Bob', 'Soap', 'Lynn', 'Trefzger', 'less', 'known', 'ones', 'vent', 'historian', 'Tom', 'Ladshaw.It', 'tribute', 'pillars', 'astonishing', 'form', 'art', 'including', 'archive', 'footage', 'as', 'early', ""1930's.The"", 'format', 'roughly', 'short', 'interview', 'thankfully', 'only', 'followed', 'short', 'excerpt', 'sketch', 'points', 'discussed', 'interviewee.Very', 'good', 'job', 'done', 'editor/producer/director.Some', 'archive', 'footage', 'understandably', 'low', 'B', 'W', 'quality', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'purpose', 'film.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'thus', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'total', 'lack', 'subtitles.In', 'many', 'parts', 'DVD', 'real', 'drawback', 'where', 'audio', 'not', 'as', 'clear', 'regular', 'DVD', 'nature', 'art', 'form', 'archive', 'footage', 'quality.The', '2', 'Q', 'A', 'panels', 'bonus', 'part', 'DVD', 'are', 'barely', 'audible', 'could', 'hardly', 'understand', 'word', 'even', 'increasing', 'volume', 'more', 'twofold', 'Subtitles', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'perfect', '5', 'stars', 'product', 'Pity', 'still', 'not', 'standard', 'feature', 'DVD', 'productions.Bottom', 'line', 'highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'delve', 'bit', 'fascinating', 'art', 'form']",N/A
