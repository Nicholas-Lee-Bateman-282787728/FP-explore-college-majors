1264393,A1JN63QBBNGB78,B002DY9KRK,Amazon Customer,"[12, 16]","Got hooked on this series while stationed in England.  Come Tuesday evening at 8PM, everything stopped to watch Lovejoy on BBC.  Ian MacShane is brilliant as Lovejoy.  He is cool, suave, debonair and just down right hunky.  Lovejoy is a series that one can sit down and enjoy with the entire family.  Was over the moon when amazon.com started offering the series.  A bit pricey but well worth the money.  Since Lovejoy, Ian has also cut quite a swath here in the U.S. with various and sundry series (such as Deadwood) as well as appearing in numerous movies.  Too bad they cancelled his ""Kings"" before it even had a chance.  Oh well, long live Lovejoy!",5,Ahhh...Lovejoy!,1248220800,"07 22, 2009",2009,652,"['Got', 'hooked', 'series', 'stationed', 'England', 'Come', 'Tuesday', 'evening', '8PM', 'everything', 'stopped', 'watch', 'Lovejoy', 'BBC', 'Ian', 'MacShane', 'brilliant', 'Lovejoy', 'cool', 'suave', 'debonair', 'just', 'down', 'right', 'hunky', 'Lovejoy', 'series', 'one', 'can', 'sit', 'down', 'enjoy', 'entire', 'family', 'Was', 'moon', 'when', 'amazon.com', 'started', 'offering', 'series', 'bit', 'pricey', 'well', 'money', 'Lovejoy', 'Ian', 'also', 'cut', 'quite', 'swath', 'here', 'U.S.', 'various', 'sundry', 'series', 'such', 'Deadwood', 'as', 'well', 'appearing', 'numerous', 'movies', 'Too', 'bad', 'cancelled', 'Kings', 'even', 'had', 'chance', 'Oh', 'well', 'long', 'live', 'Lovejoy']",Lovejoy: Season 6

Gash to enjoy episodes of this classic TV series staring Ian Mc Shane as a good-hearted but shady antiques dealer. Although not as good as some of the earlier seasons in the series, Season Six is well worth watching. Set in small town England, each episode contains the series' trademark blend of both mystery and humor.Lovejoy, for the uninformed, is a ""divy,"" able to detect whether an antique is real or fake merely by feel. This talent never seems to make him rich. He remains broke and in trouble as he stumbles from one misadventure to another. But, even though he is a scamp not above faking an antique to earn a buck, Lovejoy is always there to help a friend or even the friend of a friend.

But I don't recall Lovejoy treating anyone badly in the earlier episodes - he certainly does in the Season six series.  Now, I know that this is more in keeping with the Lovejoy of Jonathan Gash, but that persona is not what endeared so many to the television series and that Lovejoy character.The relationship between Charlotte and Lovejoy is completely annoying; and Charlotte is often incredibly stupid.  The Lady Jane character was, at minimum, an understanable one, as was her relationship to Lovejoy.  And, that episode where Charlotte allows the total jerk to rule her home and life - and he's just popped up from nowhere?
