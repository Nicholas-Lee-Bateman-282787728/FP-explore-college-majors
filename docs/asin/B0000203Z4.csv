This film, following an outcall prostitute from client to client, unflinchingly looking at the abuse to which she is subject to, is very much in line with these concerns, and is beautiful, ugly, and by the end, vaguely hysterical, even surreal. It's fascinating to watch and disturbing at the same time. Note, however, that while it does get pretty graphic in depicting some of this kinkiness, Murakami is not interested at all in titillation, and it's REALLY hard to imagine anyone getting turned on by this movie. Which is not to say voyeurs won't enjoy it -- but voyeurs of the more refined variety, please!

512824,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0000203Z4,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Tokyo Decadence (Ryu Murakami, 1992)That author and filmmaker Ryu Murakami is not a household name in the west yet is a crime. Murakami, after all, wrote the novel on which Takashi Miike's classic Audition is based, as well as cult hits Sixty-Nine, Coin Locker Babies, and In the Miso Soup, plus directing the wonderful 2000 film Kyoko (released in America under the title Dance with Me). But even Americans who are unaware of the brilliance of Murakami have a reason to check this one out; Iron Chef fans will be thrilled to catch frequent guest Tenmei Kanoh in one of his rare film roles. Murakami was not nearly as accomplished a filmmaker at the time he made this as he was when he helmed Kyoko, but he's always been a fantastic novelist (he's been at it for more than forty years now), and all of the movies he's directed over the years have been based on his own novels, which are all wonderfully filmable; you do the math.This one concerns Ai (Miho Nikaido, who has shown up in the west in No Such Thing and Henry Fool), a submissive escort who has broken the one rule of being an escort: never fall in love with a client. The client (Kanoh), however, is getting married (though his soon-to-be wife is into all this as well). When the client runs afoul of the yakuza, Ai starts questioning whether he truly is who she thought he was, and by extension whether she really is who she thinks she is.You know, the Japanese really know how to do everything up right, and that includes the erotic drama. The watered-down, silly softcore crap we get on Cinemax is nothing compared to this dark, deep, character-driven tale that's still erotic enough that in order to get it released in Italy, distributors had to cut over forty minutes from the original print (and more to the point, to this day the film remains banned in Australia). Needless to say, it's NC-17 in America, and that's with the Japanese aversion to showing pubic hair. That's pretty darned impressive for a movie that contains no fully-exposed (i.e., porn) sex scenes. The one place the film suffers is pace, and I think that may have to do with the cuts that were made to get it the NC-17 rating in America; a full director's cut of the film (which clocks in at over two hours) may well be as good as Kyoko; hopefully one day I'll get a chance to find out. Until then, the cut we get in America can be looked at as a diamond in the rough; well worth checking out, but those unfamiliar with Murakami altogether, or who only know of him through Kyoko, may be surprised at both the darkness and the explicitness here. Still worth your time. *** ",4,"Not Murakami's best, but better than anything you'll see on Cinemax.",1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,2609,"['Tokyo', 'Decadence', 'Ryu', 'Murakami', '1992', 'author', 'filmmaker', 'Ryu', 'Murakami', 'not', 'household', 'name', 'west', 'yet', 'crime', 'Murakami', 'wrote', 'novel', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'classic', 'Audition', 'based', 'as', 'well', 'cult', 'Sixty-Nine', 'Coin', 'Locker', 'Babies', 'Miso', 'Soup', 'directing', 'wonderful', '2000', 'film', 'Kyoko', 'released', 'America', 'title', 'Dance', 'Me', 'even', 'Americans', 'who', 'are', 'unaware', 'brilliance', 'Murakami', 'have', 'reason', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'Iron', 'Chef', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'thrilled', 'catch', 'frequent', 'guest', 'Tenmei', 'Kanoh', 'one', 'rare', 'film', 'roles', 'Murakami', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'accomplished', 'filmmaker', 'time', 'made', 'was', 'when', 'helmed', 'Kyoko', 'always', 'been', 'fantastic', 'novelist', 'been', 'more', 'forty', 'years', 'now', 'movies', 'directed', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'own', 'novels', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'filmable', 'do', 'math.This', 'one', 'concerns', 'Ai', 'Miho', 'Nikaido', 'who', 'shown', 'up', 'west', 'Such', 'Thing', 'Henry', 'Fool', 'submissive', 'escort', 'who', 'broken', 'one', 'rule', 'being', 'escort', 'never', 'fall', 'love', 'client', 'client', 'Kanoh', 'however', 'getting', 'married', 'soon-to-be', 'wife', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'client', 'afoul', 'yakuza', 'Ai', 'questioning', 'truly', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'extension', 'really', 'who', 'is.You', 'know', 'Japanese', 'really', 'know', 'how', 'do', 'everything', 'up', 'right', 'erotic', 'drama', 'watered-down', 'silly', 'softcore', 'crap', 'get', 'Cinemax', 'nothing', 'compared', 'dark', 'deep', 'character-driven', 'tale', 'still', 'erotic', 'enough', 'order', 'get', 'released', 'Italy', 'distributors', 'had', 'cut', 'over', 'forty', 'minutes', 'original', 'print', 'more', 'point', 'day', 'film', 'banned', 'Australia', 'Needless', 'say', 'NC-17', 'America', 'Japanese', 'aversion', 'showing', 'pubic', 'hair', 'pretty', 'darned', 'impressive', 'movie', 'fully-exposed', 'i.e.', 'porn', 'sex', 'scenes', 'one', 'place', 'film', 'suffers', 'pace', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'do', 'cuts', 'were', 'made', 'get', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'America', 'full', 'director', 'cut', 'film', 'two', 'hours', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'Kyoko', 'hopefully', 'one', 'day', ""'ll"", 'get', 'chance', 'find', 'out', 'then', 'cut', 'get', 'America', 'can', 'be', 'looked', 'diamond', 'rough', 'well', 'checking', 'out', 'unfamiliar', 'Murakami', 'altogether', 'who', 'only', 'know', 'Kyoko', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'darkness', 'explicitness', 'here', 'Still', 'time', '***']",N/A

Our heroine seems SO naive and innocent.  She states that the most important thing that she has learned in life is that she has absolutely no talent whatsoever.  All of her professional activities take place in expensive hotel rooms with wealthy clients.  All of the men clients have kinky and unusual desires, to say the least, and the women aren't much better.  Her co-workers include:  her girlfriend who seems normal, a male transvestite, and an extremely fat girl.  They each presumably specialize in serving clients with various unusual sexual desires.  There are, admittedly, aspects of this movie that I don't understand, such as there are frequently television news reports in the background about various aspects of japanese contemporary society.  At one point, she teams up with an older, more experienced young woman who has become very wealthy in the sex business, who spends a fortune on drugs, and whose dream was to become a professional singer.  Later, our heroine, while high on drugs, gets lost in a children's park and befriends an older woman, who used to be a well known professional singer, but is now somewhat deranged, and who serenades her with an Irish lulaby!?  At one point our heroine consults with a fortune teller who tells her to put a telephone book under her TV, to avoid art museums, and to wear a ring with a pink stone.  What is that all about?

512826,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0000203Z4,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[4, 5]","Written and directed by Ryu Murakami, who also wrote Takashi Miike's ""Audition"", ""TOKYO DECADENCE"" (aka. ""Topaz"", 1992) is a blistering social commentary about Japanese society. Looking at the Dvd cover, one might just see a truly erotic film but if you look beyond the image of Miho Nikaido in the cover, you will see something beyond Japan's ""pink"" cinema. This image is sexy, voyeuristic and iconic, and portrays the Asian dominatrix in the cold, pretentious world of the business world. Murakami is a critically acclaimed author responsible for ""Almost Transparent Blue"" and ""In the Miso Soup"". If you think this film is just your usual exploitive Japanese pink film, then you have another think coming...Ai (Miho Nikaido) is a timid Japanese college girl who tries to make ends meet as an S & M girl for hire within a club that caters very wealthy businessmen and lavish hotel rooms. We follow Ai through her exploits as she encounters some odd and bizarre customers; there's a shady yakuza/businessman, one drugged up guy who likes being choked, an older guy with a fetish for necrophilia, a girl named Saki who punishes her subservient client called ""Turtle face"" by making him drink Ai`s urine. All these events are the basic premise, Ai buys a topaz ring as advised by a fortune teller and she gets messed up by a drug given by Saki as she tries to find the man she had an affair with.Murakami's ""Tokyo Decadence"" is a film with a scathing critical commentary of Japanese society. His compositions have a heavy reliance on symbolism and metaphors. This film was made after Japan's skyrocketing economic bloom between the late 1980's and the early 90's--during a social and economic crisis. Murakami's storytelling is good, but it will alienate a lot of viewers. His reliance to symbolism isn't exactly easy to grasp. Suffice it to say, Murakami is criticizing his native people for the reluctance to question authority, the Japanese people's transient goals and its standardized society. Of course, to get immediate attention, Murakami uses sex as his backdrop, disguising sex and violence as a tool to express his more idealistic goals.Now there is a good number of kinky scenes and nudity, but if you are expecting a film that is exploitive and totally revolves around its sex scenes then you will be disappointed. Yes, there is girl-on-girl action and the film does have its share of the titillation elements--some are even a bit violent but if you focused on these factors, you will miss exactly what the film is trying to say. As I've mentioned, the film relies heavily on symbolism and metaphors. The topaz ring is a symbol for beauty but it is also meant to dispel sadness, anger and depression. The pill represents Ai's reliance on other people (embodied by Saki) so she can find the courage to find closure in her life; the opposite happens as Ai becomes so drugged out and confused, barely able to stand up. A strong commentary on self reliance is expressed by Murakami.The film's structure also has its weaknesses, and our main character lacks some development. All we know is that Ai had an affair with a married man, and her lifestyle choice is a little baffling for the inexperienced viewer or to one unfamiliar with the film's style. I suppose Murakami meant Ai to remain an enigma, much as any girl we see one day walking by and not see the next day. I guess it was a means to express the indifference to one another between citizens in modern Japan. Is Ai a little unstable? Who is she? Well, no one does really know anything about the other person they see in the sidewalk do they? Ai is meant more as a symbol of the common Japanese folk, than as an individual character in the film. The writer/director does get his point across so long as you look beyond the nudity and sex.Ai played by Miho Nikaido is quite enigmatic. She is a woman who looks so simple and never really that sultry until she dons that dominatrix outfit. You might say that Nikaido is a woman with secrets and although she looks very timid and shy, there is more to her than meets the eye. Ai is a woman torn by loneliness and self-loathing, which may have contributed to her choice of lifestyle. If you look into her eyes, this is a woman with a great upbringing, and make one a very good wife. Murakami expresses the unnamed victims of an economic downturn, a time where only the elite may prosper--who indulge themselves relentlessly in Japan's riches.The director was obviously looking at the dark corners of his native land and I do think he partly succeeds. The film is NOT for everyone and aimed for the esoteric few familiar with this slow-moving metaphorically rich style. This film is a cult classic because of its seriousness, and delivers all its exploitive elements with a straight face. Its scenes of S&M; are explicit and kinky, but those scenes aren't really arousing and more disturbing. It's a little too vulgar for the thinking ""art house"" audience and a little too mellow for those looking for truly graphic sex scenes. I guess you have to be in the right mood for this film and expect an offbeat experience--that is both bizarre and weird, worthy of guilty pleasure.Recommended! [3  Stars]Note: There is a rumor circulating that the director's cut is over 2 hours long but this version is only circulating in Asia. The dvd says uncut and looks better than an R-rating.The video is in enhanced anamorphic format but kept quite simple, lacks in contrast and some colors look rather murky. I think this was an intentional trick of the cinematography. The 2.0 Dolby surround Japanese Language track is clear and the English subtitles are good.Extras: Essay by Nicholas Rucka (a must read) and interview with the director Ryu Murakami and composer
