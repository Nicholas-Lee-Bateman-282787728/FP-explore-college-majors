1020884,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000IJ7A0Q,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[21, 21]","This was my first experience with instructor Debbie Rocker.  Here Debbie leads the workout in a beautiful outdoor mountain setting with 4 background exercisers (one of whom shows modifications).  She does quite a bit of marching throughout the workout, but she adds some more intense moves which help to raise the heart rate further.The warm-up lasts about 4 minutes and consists entirely on marching.  Debbie focuses on gradually encouraging you to pick up the pace, constantly talking to you like a coach or personal trainer.  Following the warm-up, the cardio work is broken down into segments.  The first is about 6 minutes and adds shuffles (light side-to-side jogs) and side steps to the basic march.  The second segment (8 minutes) weaves in some more toning-focused moves such as squats and lunges.  The 9-minute section that follows is mostly a basic walk while the scene shifts; although the scenery was beautiful, I found it harder to keep up my heart rate during this segment.  However, it does end with some easy jogs.  The next cardio segment was probably the toughest, as the intensity goes up with more toning work such as squats/lunges as well as more intense cardio moves such as skiers.  The final 11-minute segment alternates walking with intense jog segments and ends with a ""sprint to the finish.""  An approximately 3-minute cool-down/final stretch concludes the workout, bringing the total time in right around 50 minutes.This DVD includes a shorter, 30-minute (actually 32 minute) workout that consists of the warm-up; cardio segments 1, 2, and 5; and the cool-down/stretch.  Also included is a bonus CD that is supposed to be for outdoor walking.  I didn't find the CD very motivating, however--it is simply Debbie talking, occasionally encouraging you to pick up the pace as the tempo changes, but that's it.  Debbie is fairly chatty in the main workout as well, which some might find annoying; also, she does not mirror-cue.  Furthermore, she does A LOT of marching, so if you're looking for more varied moves, this might not be the right workout for you.  The main reason I liked this workout is because I found it to be more intense than some of the other walking workouts I have tried, so I will be keeping it and would recommend it for that reason.",4,Solid walking workout,1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,2279,"['was', 'first', 'experience', 'instructor', 'Debbie', 'Rocker', 'Here', 'Debbie', 'workout', 'beautiful', 'outdoor', 'mountain', 'setting', '4', 'background', 'exercisers', 'one', 'whom', 'shows', 'modifications', 'quite', 'bit', 'marching', 'workout', 'more', 'intense', 'moves', 'help', 'raise', 'heart', 'rate', 'further.The', 'warm-up', 'lasts', '4', 'minutes', 'entirely', 'marching', 'Debbie', 'gradually', 'encouraging', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'constantly', 'talking', 'coach', 'personal', 'trainer', 'Following', 'warm-up', 'cardio', 'work', 'broken', 'down', 'segments', 'first', 'about', '6', 'minutes', 'shuffles', 'light', 'side-to-side', 'jogs', 'side', 'steps', 'basic', 'march', 'second', 'segment', '8', 'minutes', 'weaves', 'more', 'toning-focused', 'moves', 'such', 'squats', 'lunges', '9-minute', 'section', 'mostly', 'basic', 'walk', 'scene', 'shifts', 'scenery', 'was', 'beautiful', 'found', 'harder', 'keep', 'up', 'heart', 'rate', 'segment', 'However', 'end', 'easy', 'jogs', 'next', 'cardio', 'segment', 'was', 'probably', 'toughest', 'intensity', 'up', 'more', 'toning', 'work', 'such', 'squats/lunges', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'intense', 'cardio', 'moves', 'such', 'skiers', 'final', '11-minute', 'segment', 'alternates', 'walking', 'intense', 'jog', 'segments', 'sprint', 'finish', 'approximately', '3-minute', 'cool-down/final', 'stretch', 'workout', 'bringing', 'total', 'time', 'right', '50', 'minutes.This', 'DVD', 'shorter', '30-minute', 'actually', '32', 'minute', 'workout', 'warm-up', 'cardio', 'segments', '1', '2', '5', 'cool-down/stretch', 'Also', 'included', 'bonus', 'CD', 'supposed', 'be', 'outdoor', 'walking', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'CD', 'very', 'motivating', 'however', 'simply', 'Debbie', 'talking', 'occasionally', 'encouraging', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'tempo', 'changes', 'Debbie', 'fairly', 'chatty', 'main', 'workout', 'as', 'well', 'might', 'find', 'annoying', 'also', 'not', 'mirror-cue', 'Furthermore', 'LOT', 'marching', 'so', ""'re"", 'looking', 'more', 'varied', 'moves', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'right', 'workout', 'main', 'reason', 'liked', 'workout', 'found', 'be', 'more', 'intense', 'other', 'walking', 'workouts', 'have', 'tried', 'will', 'be', 'keeping', 'would', 'recommend', 'reason']",Walking for Weight Loss With Debbie Rocker

Ms Rocker is easy to understand and very encouraging in her manner.  I enjoyed this video and felt I received an super walking workout. I will be looking for more videos by this lady.

1020886,A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,B000IJ7A0Q,Chandler,"[39, 39]","I have a rather extensive library of fitness dvds so that I can mix up my routine so I've also done several walking dvds to which I can compare this one...and it's a good one in my opinion.CALORIE BURN: First I'd like to touch on the caloric burn of the dvd since that is, afterall, typically the goal of the purchase. I wear a bodybugg to measure not only my daily caloric burn but also to allow me to see exactly how many calories I burn during a workout and how many calories I burn per minute during said workout.  I mention this only so that you know what I say is based upon scientific measurement rather than simply perceived exertion. I was surprised...I didn't feel worn out or wiped out and yet this rated quite high on calorie burn, especially for a walking dvd!  The instructor takes into account, it seems, current studies saying that you actually get a higher calorie burn by taking your heart rate on a roller coaster ride rather than keeping it at the same high level or low level the whole time...I've read it compared to a car that uses more gas if you speed up, slow down, go steady, speed up, slow down etc rather than going all fast or all slow...you also burn more calories, (like a car burning more gas) oddly, with the variety of heart rate and continue to burn them longer after the workout.  She actually mentions the variation during the workout so it seems it is based upon this and it worked.SCENERY: If you do the longer workout one of the coolest things they do in one part of it is you hear the trainer but they put in scenery as though you are walking through the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, A forest, walking on the beach, etc. I loved this! It was a cross between clearing your mind in meditation and being on the most beautiful walk possible while being in my air conditioned home!  It also added great interest to a fitness dvd that also offered good workout moves in the other parts of the dvd...In the other scenes the instructor and back up coaches are on a beautiful California hillside.  So if you have to be indoors to workout, it's an unusual escape in my opinion. Clever.INSTRUCTOR: Positive, upbeat, full of energy.INTEREST: I'll be the first to admit the reason I own so many workout dvds is that I have complete workout ADD and boredom. On many workouts I just stop half way and hop on an elliptical we have or start dancing. I bore easily. This one was one of the rare ones that kept my interest from start to finish. I've done both the long version and the 30 minute workout many times and I personally loved them both and stayed with it, happily, without staring at the clock. Ever. For me this is a rare oddity.WORKOUT: You'll be doing variations on walking and leg moves but with some strength and toning added simply by the variation of leg movements and arm movements. She gets your heart rate up by doing a combo of arm movements with leg movements and it works well.LEVEL: I'm pretty advanced but a beginner could do this one because she has an alternate back up coach that will do beginner moves you can follow instead. I think anyone would get results from it.MUSIC: The music is made specifically to go in tempo with your movements and is good and upbeat rather than the odd electronica you sometimes get during some fitness dvds.INCLUDED: A long workout, a 30 minute quick workout, and also an audio cd are included so that when you want to walk on the street or hike or whatever away from your dvd player and without the additional moves you get with the dvd player you have a coach and music guiding you that also sets the beat for optimum results.BACK UP TEAM: I think they put a great deal of thought into including someone everyone can identify with in their back up team. All kinds of people, all shapes, and even a man to follow along with. Although I personally can be motivated by all size 2 perfect people on a team as long as they do the moves right, many would rather follow along to someone they can identify with (and I am not a size 2!)so this allows well for that if so.NEGATIVES: The only thing that I thought was silly was the instructor talking about it being a ""high intensity workout"".  It does burn calories well but not ""high intensity"" well  like full out hard core aerobics so this seemed inaccurate to relay on the 30 minute workout. The greatest part was I didn't feel wiped out but did well, according to my bodybugg, in burning calories...but I would never call this a high intensity workout.ALTERNATIVES: Although I'm not crazy about all of Kathy Smith's dvds, she offers really good walking dvds too with fun moves and also good caloric burn. Sometimes she splices in dance steps.  So some of hers would be a good alternative or addition in a walking dvd.CONCLUSION: This ranked high on my list of fitness dvds...I felt it among the most enjoyable to do, it was rare in that it spliced in gorgeous scenery to make you feel you are in paradise when you are stuck inside working out, the calorie burn was very good but the exertion didn't feel tough, the energy and music were good...all the things to make me keep going back and hitting ""play"" on this one again and again.",5,"Higher calorie burn than expected for less exertion, cool imagery, good energy",1259020800,"11

In NO way am I a runner, high impact person, or weight lifter.

1020896,ATM32EY27D0G0,B000IJ7A0Q,"T. Smith ""tls48025""","[5, 7]","I use the Leslie Sansone workouts and really like them.  Like others, I was looking for more variety. I was also hoping the audio cd would be useful.  I love the outdoor scenery on this workout, and the walkers are pleasant, but I just didn't like the workout (the choreography felt robotic to me) or Debbie Rocker's coaching.  The workout didn't feel challenging or energizing.  Debbie says in a monotone voice that you can be more efficient and get good results with less effort, but I really like pumping it out to Leslie Sansone.  Debbie's chatter bugs me way more than Leslie Sansone's.  I didn't feel she was sincere at all.  Like the other reviewer, Debbie's ""I am your coach and life is an athletic event"" turned me off.  I feel that Leslie Sansone cares more about a person enjoying all of life more and that exercise can benefit anyone - today.  If you are looking for variety, I suggest Madeleine Lewis ""Cardio Burn"" also known as ""Get Moving: Walk for weight loss.""  The audio CD of this set would only benefit those who like her verbal coaching.",3,Nice scenery...but it ends there.,1182470400,"06 22, 2007",2007,1058,"['use', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'workouts', 'really', 'others', 'was', 'looking', 'more', 'variety', 'was', 'also', 'hoping', 'audio', 'cd', 'would', 'be', 'useful', 'love', 'outdoor', 'scenery', 'workout', 'walkers', 'are', 'pleasant', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'workout', 'choreography', 'felt', 'robotic', 'Debbie', 'Rocker', 'coaching', 'workout', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'challenging', 'energizing', 'Debbie', 'monotone', 'voice', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'efficient', 'get', 'good', 'results', 'less', 'effort', 'really', 'pumping', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'Debbie', 'chatter', 'bugs', 'way', 'more', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'sincere', 'other', 'reviewer', 'Debbie', 'am', 'coach', 'life', 'athletic', 'event', 'turned', 'off', 'feel', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'more', 'person', 'enjoying', 'life', 'more', 'exercise', 'can', 'benefit', 'anyone', 'today', 'are', 'looking', 'variety', 'suggest', 'Madeleine', 'Lewis', 'Cardio', 'Burn', 'also', 'known', 'Get', 'Moving', 'Walk', 'weight', 'loss', 'audio', 'CD', 'set', 'would', 'only', 'benefit', 'who', 'verbal', 'coaching']",Walking for Weight Loss With Debbie Rocker
