I remember watching the news coverage shown in this film as it actually happened - when Gacy was arrested and the gruesome discoveries that followed. The nation was appalled, terrified and morbidly fascinated by the undeniable proof that there is a dark side to some seemingly everyday people that is successfully hidden away by their ability to fit in with society.I've also seen several crime documentaries about Jason Moss' experience studying Gacy. It's disturbing and unsettling to know that there are people who seem to have mastered the ability to manipulate and terrorize someone to the point of controlling them psychologically. Getting inside the mind of someone like that would be a life-changing and horrible thing to deal with. I hate to imagine what it's like as a detective, profiler, psychologist or worst of all - a victim - to realize that you are dealing with a person that is consumed by violence, narcissism and a lust for total control with no regard for human life - including yours.William Forsythe was every bit as formidable and convincing as Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs ... two characters that are mesmerizing and terrifying because of the destructive use of their intelligence and the ability to gain people's trust in order to dominate them. But in this film I find it to be especially disturbing because from what I've seen and read it's (for the most part) what I consider to be an accurate portrayal of an actual, horrible event in history.Be sure to read ""the rest of the story"" right before the credits. For me it really drove home the point that the impact a sick mind can achieve if they gain control is a powerful thing that can result in a multitude of damaging, violent and deadly consequences - way beyond what is obvious.",5,"Great film, and very disturbing because it portrays what actually happened",1293062400,"12 23, 2010",2010,1800,"['was', 'blown', 'away', 'remember', 'watching', 'news', 'coverage', 'shown', 'film', 'actually', 'happened', 'when', 'Gacy', 'was', 'arrested', 'gruesome', 'discoveries', 'followed', 'nation', 'was', 'appalled', 'terrified', 'morbidly', 'fascinated', 'undeniable', 'proof', 'dark', 'side', 'seemingly', 'everyday', 'people', 'successfully', 'hidden', 'away', 'ability', 'fit', 'society.I', ""'ve"", 'also', 'seen', 'several', 'crime', 'documentaries', 'Jason', 'Moss', 'experience', 'studying', 'Gacy', 'disturbing', 'unsettling', 'know', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'mastered', 'ability', 'manipulate', 'terrorize', 'someone', 'point', 'controlling', 'psychologically', 'Getting', 'mind', 'someone', 'would', 'be', 'life-changing', 'horrible', 'thing', 'deal', 'hate', 'imagine', 'what', 'detective', 'profiler', 'psychologist', 'worst', 'victim', 'realize', 'are', 'dealing', 'person', 'consumed', 'violence', 'narcissism', 'lust', 'total', 'control', 'regard', 'human', 'life', 'including', 'yours.William', 'Forsythe', 'was', 'bit', 'formidable', 'convincing', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'mesmerizing', 'terrifying', 'destructive', 'use', 'intelligence', 'ability', 'gain', 'people', 'trust', 'order', 'dominate', 'film', 'find', 'be', 'especially', 'disturbing', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'read', 'most', 'part', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'actual', 'horrible', 'event', 'history.Be', 'sure', 'read', 'rest', 'story', 'right', 'credits', 'really', 'drove', 'home', 'point', 'impact', 'sick', 'mind', 'can', 'achieve', 'gain', 'control', 'powerful', 'thing', 'can', 'result', 'multitude', 'damaging', 'violent', 'deadly', 'consequences', 'way', 'what', 'obvious']",N/A

After exchanging letters and speaking on the phone, Jason thinks he has the upper hand in the situation, but Gacy quickly proves that he is more cunning than he appears as he infiltrates every aspect of Jason's life and infects his mind. Intense, nauseating, terrifying. DEAR MR. GACY details the true-life experiences shared between Jason Moss and his subject of study, John Wayne Gacy, as adapted from his memoirs The Last Victim. The film is a refreshing new approach to the tired serial killer theme, and one that is made that much more frightening in the fact that it was Moss' reality for seven months. William Forsythe is both captivating and repulsive at the same time as the incarcerated ""Killer Clown."" His powers of persuasion and seemingly innocent charm lure the audience in just as the real Gacy had done with his victims. The one fatal flaw that makes the story so difficult to believe is that the resourceful Gacy had the ability to track down so many details about Moss' life, and yet he was unable to figure out that Jason was a college student that was playing him from the start.

1382732,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0042DN4MW,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Although difficult to watch at times, Dear Mr. Gacy is an intense and absorbing film featuring a virtuoso performance by William Forsythe as the infamous Killer Clown.  I found the part of Jason Moss (played, oddly enough, by an actor named Jesse Moss) to be a bit overdramatic at times, but we all know that Gacy is the character we're really interested in here.  Those of us so fascinated with serial killers all want to get inside the head of someone like John Wayne Gacy, and this movie is all about Moss' efforts to do just that.  Gacy is also, dare I say it, the more likable character of the two.  As we see here, he could be as friendly and charming as anyone you're likely to meet, but - once in prison - he was never one to hide his true nature.  It's true that he was a sadistic and unconscionable psychotic killer, but he said what he meant and meant what he said.  Moss, in contrast, is a nave college student who dares to believe he can get information out of Gacy that no one in law enforcement or the mental health community had ever been able to get.  He's a con man who tried to swim with the biggest of fish and got burned in the end, manipulated by the man he thought he was manipulating.  Moss would come to call himself Gacy's last victim, but it was he who put himself in that position - Gacy was just being Gacy.  As the Killer Clown repeatedly told Moss, the two really were very much alike - deceitful, unbalanced men using manipulation to fulfill their dark desires.Most college students churn out a term paper at the last minute, but Jason Moss committed himself early in the semester to write about Gacy from a personal perspective.  His plan was to portray himself as the kind of young man Gacy was drawn to and thereby win his trust.  Letters would be exchanged, and he would somehow coax a confession out of the man on Death Row.  Moss plays the part of an abused young man, lonely and sexually confused - he even goes so far as to send provocative pictures of himself to Gacy.  The plan works - but Moss loses control of the relationship almost from the very start.  Gacy has no trouble finding Moss' address and phone number, and he begins calling his new young friend, encouraging him to explore the seedier side of the homosexual life.  Gacy quickly gets inside the mind of the nave young man, instilling a sense of fear and terror that threatens to send Moss over the edge and makes it impossible for him to end their ""friendship.""  Gacy is not a man to be spurned or ignored.  The whole story culminates in a disturbing face-to-face meeting with Gacy only a day or two before his scheduled execution.I do not believe I am alone in questioning the absolute truth of some of Moss' story.  I find it inconceivable that his meeting with Gacy could go down the way he says it did, and I do not believe there is any firm evidence to back up his account of it.  One can also question the degree to which Moss felt threatened and haunted by Gacy's threats to him and his family.  The movie tends to embellish Moss' story even more than I think he did himself.  For instance, here we see Moss go out and interview a gay hustler (which turned out to be a big mistake) as part of his research, but I believe Moss described preparing for his role as a gay hustler by reading gay literature.  Whatever the truth may be, it seems clear that this was more than just a school project for Jason Moss - there is a dark and disturbing undercurrent to his obsession with this killer.Of course, this whole story is made even more tragic by the real-life suicide of Jason Moss several years later, when the process of turning his book into a movie had gotten underway.  A husband, a best-selling author, and a successful criminal defense lawyer, Moss seemed to have everything to live for.  One cannot help but wonder if the dark stain Gacy left on his life is what pushed him over the edge, although I tend to think it was the dark side of his own nature (which Gacy certainly raised to the surface) that proved to be his undoing.  The cinematic adaptation of his story makes for fascinating viewing, but one is left feeling little pity for either of these two dark and obsessive characters.",4,A dark and disturbing film,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,4208,"['difficult', 'watch', 'times', 'Dear', 'Mr.', 'Gacy', 'intense', 'absorbing', 'film', 'featuring', 'virtuoso', 'performance', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'infamous', 'Killer', 'Clown', 'found', 'part', 'Jason', 'Moss', 'played', 'oddly', 'enough', 'actor', 'named', 'Jesse', 'Moss', 'be', 'bit', 'overdramatic', 'times', 'know', 'Gacy', 'character', ""'re"", 'really', 'interested', 'here', 'so', 'fascinated', 'serial', 'killers', 'want', 'get', 'head', 'someone', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Gacy', 'movie', 'Moss', 'efforts', 'do', 'just', 'Gacy', 'also', 'dare', 'say', 'more', 'likable', 'character', 'two', 'see', 'here', 'could', 'be', 'friendly', 'charming', 'anyone', ""'re"", 'likely', 'meet', 'once', 'prison', 'was', 'never', 'one', 'hide', 'true', 'nature', 'true', 'was', 'sadistic', 'unconscionable', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'said', 'what', 'meant', 'meant', 'what', 'said', 'Moss', 'contrast', 'nave', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'believe', 'can', 'get', 'information', 'Gacy', 'one', 'law', 'enforcement', 'mental', 'health', 'community', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'tried', 'swim', 'biggest', 'fish', 'got', 'burned', 'end', 'manipulated', 'man', 'thought', 'was', 'manipulating', 'Moss', 'would', 'come', 'call', 'Gacy', 'last', 'victim', 'was', 'who', 'put', 'position', 'Gacy', 'was', 'just', 'being', 'Gacy', 'Killer', 'Clown', 'repeatedly', 'told', 'Moss', 'two', 'really', 'were', 'very', 'much', 'deceitful', 'unbalanced', 'men', 'using', 'manipulation', 'fulfill', 'dark', 'desires.Most', 'college', 'students', 'churn', 'out', 'term', 'paper', 'last', 'minute', 'Jason', 'Moss', 'committed', 'early', 'semester', 'write', 'Gacy', 'personal', 'perspective', 'plan', 'was', 'portray', 'kind', 'young', 'man', 'Gacy', 'was', 'drawn', 'thereby', 'win', 'trust', 'Letters', 'would', 'be', 'exchanged', 'would', 'somehow', 'coax', 'confession', 'man', 'Death', 'Row', 'Moss', 'part', 'abused', 'young', 'man', 'lonely', 'sexually', 'confused', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'send', 'provocative', 'pictures', 'Gacy', 'plan', 'Moss', 'control', 'relationship', 'almost', 'very', 'start', 'Gacy', 'trouble', 'finding', 'Moss', 'address', 'phone', 'number', 'calling', 'new', 'young', 'friend', 'encouraging', 'explore', 'seedier', 'side', 'homosexual', 'life', 'Gacy', 'quickly', 'mind', 'nave', 'young', 'man', 'instilling', 'sense', 'fear', 'terror', 'send', 'Moss', 'edge', 'impossible', 'end', 'friendship', 'Gacy', 'not', 'man', 'be', 'spurned', 'ignored', 'whole', 'story', 'culminates', 'disturbing', 'face-to-face', 'meeting', 'Gacy', 'only', 'day', 'two', 'scheduled', 'execution.I', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'am', 'alone', 'questioning', 'absolute', 'truth', 'Moss', 'story', 'find', 'inconceivable', 'meeting', 'Gacy', 'could', 'go', 'down', 'way', 'did', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'firm', 'evidence', 'back', 'up', 'account', 'One', 'can', 'also', 'question', 'degree', 'Moss', 'felt', 'threatened', 'haunted', 'Gacy', 'threats', 'family', 'movie', 'embellish', 'Moss', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'think', 'did', 'instance', 'here', 'see', 'Moss', 'go', 'out', 'interview', 'gay', 'hustler', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'big', 'mistake', 'part', 'research', 'believe', 'Moss', 'described', 'preparing', 'role', 'gay', 'hustler', 'reading', 'gay', 'literature', 'truth', 'may', 'be', 'clear', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'school', 'project', 'Jason', 'Moss', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'undercurrent', 'obsession', 'killer.Of', 'course', 'whole', 'story', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'tragic', 'real-life', 'suicide', 'Jason', 'Moss', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'process', 'turning', 'book', 'movie', 'had', 'gotten', 'underway', 'husband', 'best-selling', 'author', 'successful', 'criminal', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'Moss', 'seemed', 'have', 'everything', 'live', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'wonder', 'dark', 'stain', 'Gacy', 'left', 'life', 'what', 'pushed', 'edge', 'tend', 'think', 'was', 'dark', 'side', 'own', 'nature', 'Gacy', 'certainly', 'raised', 'surface', 'proved', 'be', 'undoing', 'cinematic', 'adaptation', 'story', 'fascinating', 'viewing', 'one', 'left', 'feeling', 'little', 'pity', 'two', 'dark', 'obsessive', 'characters']",N/A

1382738,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0042DN4MW,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","While everyone knows the history of John Wayne Gacy, the serial killer who sexually abused and murdered 33 young men and boys and buried them beneath the floorboards of his home and at a nearby lake and was finally imprisoned in 1978 and executed after many appeals in 1994, probably few have heard of the book published by Jason Moss (with Jeffrey Kottler) - THE LAST VICTIM - which chronicled a seven month investigation of what makes a serial killer tick for a term paper in school.  The book, and the history surrounding the life of Gacy, has been transformed into an intensely interesting (while appalling) film by Kellie Madison and Clark Peterson and directed with style by Svetozar Ristovski.We meet Jason Moss (Jesse Moss, an actor of enormous promise) in his classroom where during a criminology lecture he decides he wants to write a term paper on John Wayne Gacy (William Forsythe).  His professor (Andrew Airlie) tries to dissuade him as does his girlfriend Alyssa (Emma Lahana) and his family (Cole Heppell, Belinda Metz and Michael Ryan).  Jason spends copious hours in the library, pastes photos and news clippings of Gacy in his bedroom, and writes a letter to Gacy in prison coupled with some suggestive photos of Jason taken by his brother.  Gacy makes contact, asks for a questionnaire that includes some very private information, and there develops a relationship of sorts between the two - serial killer and investigator.  Jason visits the streets where hustlers hang out and interviews a hustler (Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman) about the techniques of hustling men for money for sex. The information passes between Jason and Gacy becomes a lurid cat and mouse game and eventually Jason gets Gacy to agree to explain why he performed the killings (Gacy never confessed): the condition of the exchange must be a visit to Gacy in prison, a visit with Jason in his persona as an interested 'client' for Gacy which turns very bad.  At this point in the story it is difficult to sense the line between the character Jason has created and the one Gacy has created - the lines blur significantly.In 1994 Gacy is executed, Jason finishes college and proceeds to law school where he becomes a Criminal Defense Lawyer. There is an ending explained in the credits that further demonstrates the meaning of the title of Jason Moss' book.There is a fine sense of character development especially on the part of Jesse Moss as he probes more deeply into his subject matter, discovering things about himself he has never known.  William Forsythe portrays Gacy in a manner that allows us to see why young boys would follow his plans: he is evil but he is also a seductive manipulator who is apparently well liked among the prison guards.  This film may be about a grisly story, but it is handled so well that we the viewers sense every major and minor change that is happening in this experiment.  And that makes it all the more terrifying without the film resorting to showing the events of the history of one of the most serious serial killers in history.

1382742,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0042DN4MW,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[5, 6]","Direct-to-DVD movies about serial killers are so common that it's almost revolutionary when one is given the slightest bit of positive notice. I caught the trailer for Dear Mr. Gacy in a store, was slightly intrigued, and became very interested when I found mostly positive reviews. The film is based on a book I'd never heard of by Jason Moss, who developed a correspondence with serial killer John Wayne Gacy in the months leading up to his execution. Gacy died in 1994, Moss' book was published in 1999, and Moss took his own life in 2006. The book was called The Last Victim and with the knowledge of his suicide and lack of explanation for it, a whole new dimension is added to the film.I don't know how closely this film follows the book, so the following review is based solely on the film's own merit.In the film, Jason Moss (coincidentally played by an actor named Jesse Moss) decides to write his college thesis on serial killers. Posing as a troubled admirer, he sends a letter to convicted serial killer John Wayne Gacy (William Forsythe). To his surprise, Gacy responds to it. Doing whatever he can to gain Gacy's trust and get access to the darkest parts of his mind, Moss develops a frighteningly close bond with Gacy that begins taking a toll on his real life.It's troubling that Dear Mr. Gacy debuted on Canadian television and was followed with a direct-to-DVD release. Films released this way are rarely of high-quality and many people see a direct-to-DVD release as a badge of mediocrity. This is not the case with Dear Mr. Gacy. What we have here is a film that is not a horror film, but gets under your skin more effectively than any theatrically-released horror film that I can recall being released in 2010. It's also a low-budget film that never looks or feels cheap with a convincing lead performance by newcomer Jesse Moss, and one of the best portrayals of a real-life serial killer I've ever witnessed by William Forsythe.Glancing at Forsythe's filmography, I've seen several of his films but he's only stood out in Rob Zombie's Halloween and The Devil's Rejects. I am not exaggerating when I say that Forsythe could have earned an Oscar nomination if The Last Victim had a higher budget, an actual theatrical release, and maybe some well-known people behind the camera. It's one of the most convincing performances I've seen this year. The first time we see Forsythe as Gacy is in a still photograph based on Gacy's mugshot. There's not much of a resemblance, but I accepted that he would be Gacy for the duration of the film. When Forsythe is finally seen on-screen portraying Gacy, it's a revelatory moment. He's gained weight for the role and the hairstyle is right, but once he begins speaking and the film begins progressively revealing the full extent of Gacy's character it becomes apparent how much he captured the essence of Gacy. Forsythe plays Gacy as a normal, intelligent, and friendly human being revealing Gacy as the sociopath he was in perfect synchronicity with Gacy revealing himself to Jason. Where some well-known, well-respected actors would have gone over-the-top or showy with their performance resulting in a typical one-dimensional serial killer, Forsythe slowly shows Gacy's normality wearing thin with an eerie, collected realism that's both fascinating and disturbing. A real-life serial killer is a psychologically complex character that's very difficult for any actor to tackle, especially when it's a well-written, real-life serial killer. Forsythe's performance is not this revelation because he's in a direct-to-DVD release or because he's not an actor known for embodying complicated characters...It's because it's a completely convincing performance. As far as direct-to-DVD releases about serial killers go, the only other performance to come close to the realism of Forsythe is Steve Railsback's portrayal ofEd Geinin the film of the same name.Obviously, Forsythe blew my mind in this film. If only the film was as perfect as his performance is. All of the performances are just fine and the film maintains a dreary, grayish atmosphere that lends to the effect of Jason's correspondence with Gacy on his life. Obviously, the filmmakers didn't have much money to work with but the film never feels cheap. Except for a few ""direct-to-DVD vibes,"" I would have thought this was just an independent theatrical release that flew under the radar. There have been a dizzying amount of direct-to-DVD films about serial killers such as Jeffrey Dahmer, Ed Gein, Ted Bundy, Richard Speck, and even John Wayne Gacy over the years and it's rather tragic that this film will be grouped together with that dreck.Dear Mr. Gacy is not perfect due mostly to an uneven script that occasionally loses focus and stretches our suspension of disbelief a bit too far. As stated earlier, I have not read Jason's book but I found some scenes (the face-to-face meeting, Jason's assault on a high school student, and Gacy's ability to find anything from his cell...except that Jason is a college student) just a bit too unbelievable in an otherwise very realistically told movie. If this was a part of Jason's book, the filmmakers should have handled it better for those who have not read the book and would immediately think 'that wouldn't happen.' Imperfections aside and despite falling into the ""true crime"" genre, Dear Mr. Gacy is more disturbing and effective than most horror films. It's also a terrific character study of the psychological workings of a serial killer and how Gacy was able to manipulate Jason while Jason was simultaneously manipulating him. The film feels genuinely like a tragedy when we realize that Jason, in his own way, may have been Gacy's last victim.I highly recommend Dear Mr. Gacy for those looking for a good film about a real-life serial killer. There's very few of them out there and Dear Mr. Gacy is a real delight. As a direct-to-DVD release, it's great. It's a true study of a psychopath, that doesn't just exploit it's subject to tell a cheap horror story. In fact, there is no gore and only brief scenes of violence shown in flashbacks. It's lack of a theatrical release is a tragedy, as Dear Mr. Gacy ranks up there with true-life serial killer films likeThe Boston Stranglerand Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. Forsythe's performance is one of a kind in the way it gets under the skin of a real serial killer and it's unfortunate that this performance won't garner him much critical notice.Dear Mr. Gacy succeeds at what dozens of cheap films released each year fail at doing. It's an effective, haunting, rare, and introspective look at a serial killer without the blood and gore...If Dear Mr. Gacy isn't quite one of the best films of the year, it's possibly the best horror film of 2010. What other direct-to-DVD film could receive such praise?GRADE: B",4,A Tragic Victim of a Direct-to-DVD Release with An Awe-Inspiring Performance by William Forsythe,1292716800,"12 19,

This is NOT a Gacy victim exploitation film.  The film is based Jason Moss' book, The Last Victim.  The idea that one's psyche can be ""inhabited"" by the psychosis of another has been used before in films like ""Manhunter,"" but this is the first time I have known of such an experience - based in truth.  Most of the physical violence in the film is (happily)  mostly implied and the film itself is interspersed with actual news footage of Gacy's home, victim skeletal remains, etc.  What remains is truly terrifying.  Through letters and photos, young collegiate Jason Moss seduces JW Gacy (and a few other well-known serial killers) for his term paper, a treatise on such killers. Despite Jason's motive and intellect, he soon become the prey to the psychotic and master-manipulator, Mr. Gacy.  Jason's descent into the sick machinations of Gacy's mind is the core of this film. The dichotomy is that regardless of how disturbing and scary that descent, the viewer cannot look away.  Jason's final face-to-face with Gacy will stay with the viewer for quite a while. On a conscious level, we know evil exists; it's another thing altogether to see it put on display.As mezmerizing as the film itself is, the epilogue is breath-taking with the real Jason Moss recounting a piece of his story on Leeza Gibbon, underscoring that this was not imagined horror.

Others are depicted as documentaries. And then there is the real life story that is turned into drama, sometimes bad and others good. DEAR MR. GACY lands in between.The story revolves around Jason Moss (Jesse Moss), a young law student not performing up to his potential in college who is searching for a centerpiece for his thesis. He finds it while watching the news as he becomes fascinated with serial killer John Wayne Gacy (William Forsythe). Gacy is soon to be executed, coming down to his last attempt at a stay of execution and Jason's chance to speak to him is slipping by fast.Jason realizes that he has to find an in, a way to get Gacy's attention, realizing that chances are he receives tons of letters on a daily basis. To do so, he attempts to get into the psyche of Gacy, playing off of the information that Gacy tended to pick up on young boys. He sends Gacy a letter that is in ways flirtatious. To seal the deal he ends up sending Gacy photos of himself shirtless and describing how he's considering hustling himself on the streets.Its all done in an attempt to gain Gacy's trust so that he'll open up to him, speak to him and perhaps give him the chance to discover why Gacy did the things he did. But as their correspondence continues, Jason finds himself drawn into the dark world of Gacy's mind, falling prey to the things Gacy encourages him to do, including a trip to the world of street hustlers where he is drugged and almost raped.Jason is perhaps Gacy's last victim. His life changes and those around him see it happening though they don't know why. He spends time bodybuilding, argues with his parents and brother and goes so far as to dump his girlfriend. The letters lead to phone calls that Gacy places to Jason which he accepts. The lies he tells to paint the portrait of himself that he knows Gacy expects build one on top of the other until he finally gets the chance to meet Gacy in prison. It is here that Jason is witness to the true monster that was John Wayne Gacy.The movie is terribly depressing, but not so much in a bad way. The slow decent into a form of madness that overtakes Jason is well played by Moss as we see the changes develop over time. Forsythe, a totally underappreciated actor who has starred in everything from OUT FOR JUSTICE, THE ROCK and THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD, does a truly menacing portrayal of Gacy, showing the manipulative side of him that convinces Jason to do the things he does while at the same time show the animalistic frenzy that fills Gacy when he confronts the obsessive fan alone in a prison cell.Gacy was an unusual killer. Well respected in the community, known for his dressing as a clown for children's parties and celebrated for his paintings of clowns while in prison, he was not what most people expected when thinking of a serial killer. But the acts he committed, not just to the boys he killed but to Jason Moss as well, were some of the most brutal imagined. This movie is on the low budget scale but it tells the story well and holds your interest. While there are moments you want to look away, there are others that keep you watching from beginning to end. Here's hoping that the number of potential serial killers like Gacy dwindle rather than grow.",3,THE MONSTER BEHIND THE MAN,1298592000,"02 25, 2011",2011,3385,"['True', 'stories', 'make', 'interesting', 'movies', 'tend', 'go', 'overboard', 'melodrama', 'usually', 'ending', 'up', 'Lifetime', 'network', 'Others', 'are', 'depicted', 'documentaries', 'then', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'turned', 'drama', 'sometimes', 'bad', 'others', 'good', 'DEAR', 'MR.', 'GACY', 'between.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Jason', 'Moss', 'Jesse', 'Moss', 'young', 'law', 'student', 'not', 'performing', 'up', 'potential', 'college', 'who', 'searching', 'centerpiece', 'thesis', 'watching', 'news', 'fascinated', 'serial', 'killer', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Gacy', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'Gacy', 'soon', 'be', 'executed', 'coming', 'down', 'last', 'attempt', 'stay', 'execution', 'Jason', 'chance', 'speak', 'slipping', 'fast.Jason', 'realizes', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'Gacy', 'attention', 'realizing', 'chances', 'are', 'tons', 'letters', 'daily', 'basis', 'do', 'so', 'get', 'psyche', 'Gacy', 'playing', 'information', 'Gacy', 'tended', 'pick', 'up', 'young', 'boys', 'Gacy', 'letter', 'ways', 'flirtatious', 'seal', 'deal', 'up', 'sending', 'Gacy', 'photos', 'shirtless', 'describing', 'how', 'considering', 'hustling', 'streets.Its', 'done', 'attempt', 'gain', 'Gacy', 'trust', 'so', ""'ll"", 'open', 'up', 'speak', 'perhaps', 'give', 'chance', 'discover', 'why', 'Gacy', 'did', 'things', 'did', 'correspondence', 'Jason', 'drawn', 'dark', 'world', 'Gacy', 'mind', 'falling', 'prey', 'things', 'Gacy', 'do', 'including', 'trip', 'world', 'street', 'hustlers', 'where', 'drugged', 'almost', 'raped.Jason', 'perhaps', 'Gacy', 'last', 'victim', 'life', 'changes', 'see', 'happening', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'time', 'bodybuilding', 'parents', 'brother', 'so', 'far', 'dump', 'girlfriend', 'letters', 'lead', 'phone', 'calls', 'Gacy', 'places', 'Jason', 'lies', 'paint', 'portrait', 'Gacy', 'build', 'one', 'top', 'other', 'finally', 'chance', 'meet', 'Gacy', 'prison', 'here', 'Jason', 'witness', 'true', 'monster', 'was', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Gacy.The', 'movie', 'terribly', 'depressing', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'bad', 'way', 'slow', 'decent', 'form', 'madness', 'Jason', 'well', 'played', 'Moss', 'see', 'changes', 'develop', 'time', 'Forsythe', 'totally', 'underappreciated', 'actor', 'who', 'starred', 'everything', 'OUT', 'FOR', 'JUSTICE', 'THE', 'ROCK', 'THINGS', 'TO', 'DO', 'IN', 'DENVER', 'WHEN', 'YOU', 'DEAD', 'truly', 'menacing', 'portrayal', 'Gacy', 'showing', 'manipulative', 'side', 'Jason', 'do', 'things', 'same', 'time', 'show', 'animalistic', 'frenzy', 'Gacy', 'when', 'obsessive', 'fan', 'alone', 'prison', 'cell.Gacy', 'was', 'unusual', 'killer', 'Well', 'respected', 'community', 'known', 'dressing', 'clown', 'children', 'parties', 'celebrated', 'paintings', 'clowns', 'prison', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'expected', 'when', 'thinking', 'serial', 'killer', 'acts', 'committed', 'not', 'just', 'boys', 'killed', 'Jason', 'Moss', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'most', 'brutal', 'imagined', 'movie', 'low', 'budget', 'scale', 'story', 'well', 'interest', 'are', 'moments', 'want', 'look', 'away', 'are', 'others', 'keep', 'watching', 'beginning', 'end', 'Here', 'hoping', 'number', 'potential', 'serial', 'killers', 'Gacy', 'dwindle', 'rather', 'grow']",N/A

Based on a true story, the film tells the tale of college student, Jason Moss who decided to contact Mr. Gacy during his final year alive and try to find out things about no one else including the F.B.I. could get plus his was the subject John was using as his final term paper for school so he does have a motive. Early on I have to say I found Jason's fascination with Gacy a bit creepy and never having the read the book I was interested in finding out what was inside the head of the young man as well. The first letter he writes to John is one that paints a picture of a tough home life, of someone looking to reach out as a friend. After seeing an interview on Television where John states he is bi-sexual Jason takes the next step by posing and taking seductive pictures to send along in the next letter to John. Based on the book ""The Last Victim"" written by Jason Moss it paints a picture of someone looking to get into the head of Mr. Gacy but as the relationship moves along you quickly find out that John is a master and Jason is really no match. Jason slowly begins to journey now a dark path of destruction that effects his relationship with both his family and his girlfriend as John gets deeper and deeper in his subconscious. To go on and on about the story here would only ruin the experience for those waiting to see the film but I can say this is a dark, disturbing and and almost hypnotic look into the mind of a crazed killer, like Mr. Gacy himself the film gets in your head and stays with you long after it is over. William Forsythe gives one of if not his best performances as Gacy, he must of done a lot of research to be able to play him with such realism. Also Jesse Moss did a fantastic job playing Jason, the young man that gets more than he bargained for when taking on such a twisted mind. As the film was coming to an end I thought to myself that those 7 months with Gacy had to take its toll on Jason and had to effected the rest of his life and sure enough in the notes during the credits you find out just how much a toll it did take.""Dear Mr. Gacy"" is one of the best serial killer films I have seen in a very long time, it has fantastic production values, an amazing cast and a gritty,dark and realistic feel that sends chills down your spine.

1382752,A24K6KR7RHW7XB,B0042DN4MW,Ron,"[1, 1]","This movie takes a different approach to the well traveled serial killer genre based on factual accounts by the student (Moss) who made Gacy (Forsythe) the theme of his term paper and later a best selling book.The idea of trying to get into the mind of a serial killer is not new and has been used for movies and law enforcement for decades. The departure from other movies in this genre is that a student (Moss) who chose to use Gacy as his project for his term paper who thinks he has the upper hand when dealing with Gacy.  He hopes and thinks that he alone will be able to extract a confession and find out what was his motivation for the killings. He would be able to do what the FBI, psychiatrists local law enforcement weren't able to. The notion that most young people share is their belief that they are smarter and all knowing and that is what led our young student (Moss) down a slippery slope.The movie does a good job of telling this story through the eyes of the student (Moss) and Gacy (Forsythe) as the main focus, but it also reflected the side effects of their relationship with the students (Moss) family and friends.  Moss's characters downward spiraling mental state was played quite convincingly as he deteriorated into a paranoid train wreck. The movie also makes note of Gacy's relationships with the prison guards and just how much latitude he was allowed.Several reviewers have noted the accuracy the movie possessed in relation to the book, but I wonder just how much artistic freedom was used in the telling of this story to make it more interesting to the viewer. The reason I mention this is because I thought that all prisoner mail in and out going is read as well as all inmate calls are recorded. So how did the pictures make it past the screening process? I kind of had a hard time believing Gacy had so much freedom that he could have killed the student. I guess when the student signed the release form the guards didn't care if they broke the rules regarding prison visitors or the fact that their reckless actions were caught on tape. I can't say for sure that they were monitering Gacy's mail and phone calls in 94 or if the mandatory montering (I believe is being done. Remember these guys have ZERO RIGHTS) of all communications started later in the prison system, but since he was so high profile I find it hard to believe they did not check all correspondence. This guy was a convicted pedophile, rapist and murderer who they had to keep under control. They wanted and needed to know if he had other victims and who and where they were.The acting is very good and believable from Moss as well as Forsythe' s characters and their dialogue came across and realistic and was not over played. The director was able to extract very good performances out of Moss and Forsythe that added a good deal of credibility to their given roles. The locations that were used also worked well with adding another layer to the stories credibility.Rating 0 to 5Story = 4+Acting = 4+Direction = 4Fear/Creep Factor =3.6Gore = 2Cursing = 4Sex/Nudity = Yes/NoEntertainment Value = 4Would I watch again = Yes",4,Call Me John,1375056000,"07 29, 2013",2013,3127,"['movie', 'different', 'approach', 'well', 'traveled', 'serial', 'killer', 'genre', 'based', 'factual', 'accounts', 'student', 'Moss', 'who', 'made', 'Gacy', 'Forsythe', 'theme', 'term', 'paper', 'later', 'best', 'selling', 'book.The', 'idea', 'trying', 'get', 'mind', 'serial', 'killer', 'not', 'new', 'been', 'used', 'movies', 'law', 'enforcement', 'decades', 'departure', 'other', 'movies', 'genre', 'student', 'Moss', 'who', 'chose', 'use', 'Gacy', 'project', 'term', 'paper', 'who', 'upper', 'hand', 'when', 'dealing', 'Gacy', 'alone', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'extract', 'confession', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'motivation', 'killings', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'what', 'FBI', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'notion', 'most', 'young', 'people', 'share', 'belief', 'are', 'smarter', 'knowing', 'what', 'led', 'young', 'student', 'Moss', 'down', 'slippery', 'slope.The', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'eyes', 'student', 'Moss', 'Gacy', 'Forsythe', 'main', 'focus', 'also', 'reflected', 'side', 'effects', 'relationship', 'students', 'Moss', 'family', 'friends', 'Moss', 'characters', 'downward', 'spiraling', 'mental', 'state', 'was', 'played', 'quite', 'convincingly', 'deteriorated', 'paranoid', 'train', 'wreck', 'movie', 'also', 'note', 'Gacy', 'relationships', 'prison', 'guards', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'latitude', 'was', 'allowed.Several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'accuracy', 'movie', 'possessed', 'relation', 'book', 'wonder', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'artistic', 'freedom', 'was', 'used', 'telling', 'story', 'make', 'more', 'interesting', 'viewer', 'reason', 'mention', 'thought', 'prisoner', 'mail', 'going', 'read', 'as', 'well', 'inmate', 'calls', 'are', 'recorded', 'how', 'did', 'pictures', 'make', 'screening', 'process', 'kind', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'Gacy', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'freedom', 'could', 'have', 'killed', 'student', 'guess', 'when', 'student', 'signed', 'release', 'form', 'guards', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'broke', 'rules', 'regarding', 'prison', 'visitors', 'fact', 'reckless', 'actions', 'were', 'caught', 'tape', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'sure', 'were', 'monitering', 'Gacy', 'mail', 'phone', 'calls', '94', 'mandatory', 'montering', 'believe', 'being', 'done', 'Remember', 'guys', 'have', 'ZERO', 'RIGHTS', 'communications', 'started', 'later', 'prison', 'system', 'was', 'so', 'high', 'profile', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'did', 'not', 'check', 'correspondence', 'guy', 'was', 'convicted', 'pedophile', 'rapist', 'murderer', 'who', 'had', 'keep', 'control', 'wanted', 'needed', 'know', 'had', 'other', 'victims', 'who', 'where', 'were.The', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'believable', 'Moss', 'as', 'well', 'Forsythe', 's', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'came', 'realistic', 'was', 'not', 'played', 'director', 'was', 'able', 'extract', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'Moss', 'Forsythe', 'added', 'good', 'deal', 'credibility', 'given', 'roles', 'locations', 'were', 'used', 'also', 'worked', 'well', 'adding', 'layer', 'stories', 'credibility.Rating', '0', '5Story', '=', '4+Acting', '4+Direction', '4Fear/Creep', 'Factor', '=3.6Gore', '=', '2Cursing', '=', '4Sex/Nudity', '=', 'Yes/NoEntertainment', 'Value', '=', '4Would', 'watch', 'again', '=', 'Yes']",N/A

Not me! My facination with serial killers only goes so far,Jason's alot braver than I am. I did watch the final note before the closing credits, shame what happened after the movie's events.I wonder if an independent film company will ever do a movie, more accurately on Dahmer-but I guess even Hollywood is ready to to let that sleeping dog lie, oh well.This is the second movie I've seen about JWG-""Gacy"" being the first, and I got to say, this film was a much better portrayal, William was much more convincing than that other actor, plus this storyline seemed pretty plausible, my big question still remains-yeah there are certain actors I'd like to meet, but serial killers? I'd be too frightened to even visit one from padded glass!I may be getting off on a tangent, but I digress: if you want explore the mind of a serial killer, this may help, I bought this from my local fye because I like William Forsythe's portrayals of different charecters, but I got more depth than expected, now I really wish they could do a more realistic portrayal of Dahmer-but will they?

1382757,A96JD9312DHWC,B0042DN4MW,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[2, 2]","When J.w. Gacy was finally ""forced to pay"" for his crimes, the waiting seemed to take forever. It did take a while, too, because of the appeals he is granted by law and his need to seem guilt-free. As one quote mentions in the movie, Gacy said his only crime was ""running a funeral home without a lisence."" He also did not coness, and that seemed like bait to some people. Enter the main person in this tale, hoping for osmething new and wanting so much to write a meaningful paper in his Criminology class, who writes Gacy and says he is many things. This opens a door to the man, a door the student things he can control, but slowly finds himself wanting more. This opens it the other way, giving Gacy power and letting him feel in chage again. Still, where will this lead - anywhere in the way of a paer or in the direction of a killer with a date with three needles and death?As far as Dear Mr. Gacy went, I had a love/hate relationship with it. When we start out, we see Gacy and a recount of his crimes. They are horrible, too, and they really do paint a man that could be dangerous to mess with. Then we see our student and the way he decides to talk to Gacy, dangling himself in front of the guy for bait. That had a bad feeling to it, like it would go wrong, and it really does sit like a poor decision. Add to this the fact that Gacy is played well and the fright becomes transparent and you have a nice little arena for the movie to play in.along with this was the fact that there were times when I felt this was a 5 star plus film, but those times were tempered with a feeling of 3 star dread while I waiting and it really felt distracting. There wer etwo things that bothered me a bit in this, and those things were somewhat hard to ingore. I say this because of the ""based on"" caim and the fact that this went along the movie way you somewhat expect (skip the next paragraph if you do want a minor spoiler).The middle was really bad in that character becoming a crying victim sort of way, and it really set badly on me. Sure, he was delaing with Gacy. Sure, he was scared. I got that. I just didn't get why it took fifteen minutes of reinforcement to get that across. along with that was the thing that happened with the callgirl, where she is talked with and then messed with a little more and then almost taken in such a naughty way. Here you have the Gacy reminder about how he could have been just like him, with the girl playing on his mind. you also have the following portion - a bette rpart, mind you - also being reinforced, but it seems like overkill.I wonder if this was something that happened because it seems overplayed.As far as movies go, I did like this. i did not feel great about ownership, mind you, but the watch was good. I do not know about haunting you - if you are haunted by movies like this then do not watch anything beyond standard horror - but I do know that the mistakes are fun to watch and the ""education"" recieved here is fun to see playing out. Drinking strange drinks; this seemed like a victim narrative playing out the whole way through and then you find out about the book that was written and see ""the speech.""I didn't here anything aobut the conduct in that portion that was shown about it and found that funny, knowing that he was like Gacy in that respect at least. That, and he did play the part he wanted to play in the end.Solid 4 for watching, not quite there for owning. This is more of a perosnal decision when it comes to the collection you want.",4,Making the mistake of a lifetime might mean a short lifetime,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,3510,"['When', 'J.w', 'Gacy', 'was', 'finally', 'forced', 'pay', 'crimes', 'waiting', 'seemed', 'take', 'forever', 'did', 'take', 'while', 'too', 'appeals', 'granted', 'law', 'need', 'seem', 'guilt-free', 'one', 'quote', 'mentions', 'movie', 'Gacy', 'said', 'only', 'crime', 'was', 'running', 'funeral', 'home', 'lisence', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'coness', 'seemed', 'bait', 'people', 'Enter', 'main', 'person', 'tale', 'hoping', 'osmething', 'new', 'wanting', 'so', 'much', 'write', 'meaningful', 'paper', 'Criminology', 'class', 'who', 'Gacy', 'many', 'things', 'door', 'man', 'door', 'student', 'things', 'can', 'control', 'slowly', 'wanting', 'more', 'other', 'way', 'giving', 'Gacy', 'power', 'letting', 'feel', 'chage', 'again', 'Still', 'where', 'will', 'lead', 'anywhere', 'way', 'paer', 'direction', 'killer', 'date', 'three', 'needles', 'death', 'As', 'far', 'Dear', 'Mr.', 'Gacy', 'went', 'had', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'When', 'start', 'out', 'see', 'Gacy', 'recount', 'crimes', 'are', 'horrible', 'too', 'really', 'do', 'paint', 'man', 'could', 'be', 'dangerous', 'mess', 'Then', 'see', 'student', 'way', 'talk', 'Gacy', 'dangling', 'front', 'guy', 'bait', 'had', 'bad', 'feeling', 'would', 'go', 'wrong', 'really', 'sit', 'poor', 'decision', 'Add', 'fact', 'Gacy', 'played', 'well', 'fright', 'becomes', 'transparent', 'have', 'nice', 'little', 'arena', 'movie', 'play', 'in.along', 'was', 'fact', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'felt', 'was', '5', 'star', 'film', 'times', 'were', 'tempered', 'feeling', '3', 'star', 'dread', 'waiting', 'really', 'felt', 'distracting', 'wer', 'etwo', 'things', 'bothered', 'bit', 'things', 'were', 'somewhat', 'hard', 'ingore', 'say', 'based', 'caim', 'fact', 'went', 'movie', 'way', 'somewhat', 'expect', 'skip', 'next', 'paragraph', 'do', 'want', 'minor', 'spoiler', '.The', 'middle', 'was', 'really', 'bad', 'character', 'becoming', 'crying', 'victim', 'sort', 'way', 'really', 'set', 'badly', 'Sure', 'was', 'delaing', 'Gacy', 'Sure', 'was', 'scared', 'got', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'took', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'reinforcement', 'get', 'across', 'was', 'thing', 'happened', 'callgirl', 'where', 'talked', 'then', 'messed', 'little', 'more', 'then', 'almost', 'taken', 'such', 'naughty', 'way', 'Here', 'have', 'Gacy', 'reminder', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'girl', 'playing', 'mind', 'also', 'have', 'following', 'portion', 'bette', 'rpart', 'mind', 'also', 'being', 'reinforced', 'overkill.I', 'wonder', 'was', 'something', 'happened', 'overplayed.As', 'far', 'movies', 'go', 'did', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'great', 'ownership', 'mind', 'watch', 'was', 'good', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'haunting', 'are', 'haunted', 'movies', 'then', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'anything', 'standard', 'horror', 'do', 'know', 'mistakes', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'education', 'recieved', 'here', 'fun', 'see', 'playing', 'out', 'Drinking', 'strange', 'drinks', 'seemed', 'victim', 'narrative', 'playing', 'out', 'whole', 'way', 'then', 'find', 'out', 'book', 'was', 'written', 'see', 'speech', 'did', ""n't"", 'here', 'anything', 'aobut', 'conduct', 'portion', 'was', 'shown', 'found', 'funny', 'knowing', 'was', 'like', 'Gacy', 'respect', 'least', 'did', 'play', 'part', 'wanted', 'play', 'end.Solid', '4', 'watching', 'not', 'quite', 'owning', 'more', 'perosnal', 'decision', 'when', 'collection', 'want']",N/A
1382758,A38RTTX1916P52,B0042DN4MW,Vykoden,"[4, 11]","What do you think is going to happen when a naive college student becomes penpals with a man who raped and killed 33 young men and is awaiting his own execution?John Gacy was disturbed, and his crimes were disturbing. But, what's equally disturbing is that we have a prison system that allows people to establish social and even romantic relationships with death row convicts.The marketing of this movie was an epic failure. In the description, the company claims Gacy was ""America's most notorious mass murderer."" This is, of course, false for two reasons: 1) A mass murderer is someone who kills more than one person at the same time. A serial killer (Gacy) is someone who kills three or more people (at different times). 2) Gacy was convicted of killing 33 young men. Henry Lee Lucas, however, was believed to have killed more than 300 people, and he was believed to have been involved in more than 500 murders across the United States, and that would kinda have to make Lucas just a tad more notorious, in my opinion.Obviously, Moss was a bit delusional to believe there wouldn't be consequences for his actions. In real life, Moss was working on his honors thesis when he seduced Gacy (and other convicted serial killers) into penpal relationships, and while Moss' project was a unique concept, Moss was naive to believe he could accomplish his goal unscathed. It was, simply, another reckless act by a representative of the uneducated public. In my opinion, this really isn't anything about which a movie should be made.If you're a death monger or someone who is fascinated by Hollywood's depiction of homicidal psychopaths, you will probably love this movie. Personally, I thought it was a boring, candy-coated peek into the mind of a serial killer.The cast acted their parts very well, but the story is a no brainer. If you play with fire, you will get burned. And, if you become penpals with a serial killer, how you view the world around you will change.
