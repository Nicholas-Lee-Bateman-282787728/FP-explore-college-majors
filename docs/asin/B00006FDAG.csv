713018,A1F0OQW1I515ZO,B00006FDAG,R. C. Tapia,"[2, 3]","I bought this movie because my son has become obsessed with Land before Time. I got tired of watching the same 2 over and over again so I ordered about 5 different ones. Since now I have about 7 and watch them VERY frequently I have noticed a pattern with these.First of all none of them have compared to the first which is by far my favorite for several reasons. The main reason being that it is one of the only ones where the kids get seperated from their families and they search to be with them. In EVERY other movie I own the kids run of on their on there own without their parents!!! This drives me crazy! There are great morals in most of these stories but the fact that nearly every movie they run off behind their parents back annoys me to no end. What kind of message does that send our kids??In this one Duckies egg/brother or sister gets egg napped. They end up finding a sharp teeth egg instead (but dont worry duckies sibling is okay too). And where did they chase these egg nappers to- you got it into the mysterious beyound, without their parents AGAIN!?!?! But anyways the movie is cute- mainly because Chomper is a cute addition to the movie. I know he is another one but I have not been able to find that one- they end up on an island with sharpteeth on it, anyone know that one? The egg nappers are more annoying then funny but oh well. The kids have another adventure and learn some lessons along the way.",4,"pattern, but cute story",1288828800,"11 4, 2010",2010,1426,"['bought', 'movie', 'son', 'become', 'obsessed', 'Land', 'Time', 'got', 'tired', 'watching', 'same', '2', 'over', 'again', 'so', 'ordered', 'about', '5', 'different', 'ones', 'now', 'have', '7', 'watch', 'VERY', 'frequently', 'have', 'noticed', 'pattern', 'these.First', 'none', 'have', 'compared', 'first', 'far', 'favorite', 'several', 'reasons', 'main', 'reason', 'being', 'one', 'only', 'ones', 'where', 'kids', 'get', 'seperated', 'families', 'search', 'be', 'EVERY', 'other', 'movie', 'own', 'kids', 'run', 'own', 'parents', 'crazy', 'are', 'great', 'morals', 'most', 'stories', 'fact', 'nearly', 'movie', 'run', 'off', 'parents', 'back', 'end', 'What', 'kind', 'message', 'send', 'kids', 'one', 'sister', 'egg', 'napped', 'end', 'up', 'finding', 'sharp', 'teeth', 'egg', 'instead', 'worry', 'duckies', 'sibling', 'okay', 'too', 'where', 'did', 'chase', 'egg', 'nappers', 'to-', 'got', 'mysterious', 'beyound', 'parents', 'movie', 'cute-', 'mainly', 'Chomper', 'cute', 'addition', 'movie', 'know', 'one', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'find', 'one-', 'end', 'up', 'island', 'sharpteeth', 'anyone', 'know', 'one', 'egg', 'nappers', 'are', 'more', 'annoying', 'then', 'funny', 'oh', 'well', 'kids', 'have', 'adventure', 'learn', 'lessons', 'way']",N/A
