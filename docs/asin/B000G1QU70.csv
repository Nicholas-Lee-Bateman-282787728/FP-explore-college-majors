998115,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B000G1QU70,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[5, 5]","I can't remember when I heard about this film, but once I did, it went into the queue at Netflix.  It's really a quietly amazing piece of filmmaking.  It has almost a Bressonian vibe to it.  The film was shot exclusively in and around Scranton, PA, which really gives it a unique look.Technically, it could have better.  The sound is muffled at times, and the shaky camerawork is distracting at times.  But there are several astounding scenes, like the opening sequence, where Wanda (played by writer/director Barbara Loden) is wandering through a coal quarry for several minutes.  There is a scene shot in a catacomb museum that is really striking.  A bank robbery scene has a surreal, strange vibe to it, reminiscent of Bresson's L'argent bank heist.  The ending is also quite stunning.  Even the rather standard plot line of ""lovers on the run"" (Wanda hooks up with a bank robber for the last hour of the film) is enhanced by the style and substance of the film.  It's slow, almost European like in its pacing, which works wonderfully.  The only American film that it reminds me of is Monte Hellman's Two Lane Blacktop, in that it's an American film with a distinctively European vibe.  I was really surprised by this amazingly quiet, almost transcendent film.  It's a shame that Barbara Loden died shortly after making this (she died of cancer at 48), as this is her only film as writer/director.  But if you get a chance, you should see this one soon.",5,Quietly surprising and enthalling....,1200182400,"01 13, 2008",2008,1456,"['ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'when', 'heard', 'film', 'once', 'did', 'went', 'queue', 'Netflix', 'really', 'quietly', 'amazing', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'almost', 'Bressonian', 'vibe', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'exclusively', 'Scranton', 'PA', 'really', 'unique', 'look.Technically', 'could', 'have', 'better', 'sound', 'muffled', 'times', 'shaky', 'camerawork', 'distracting', 'times', 'are', 'several', 'astounding', 'scenes', 'opening', 'sequence', 'where', 'Wanda', 'played', 'writer/director', 'Barbara', 'Loden', 'wandering', 'coal', 'quarry', 'several', 'minutes', 'scene', 'shot', 'catacomb', 'museum', 'really', 'striking', 'bank', 'robbery', 'scene', 'surreal', 'strange', 'vibe', 'reminiscent', 'Bresson', ""L'argent"", 'bank', 'heist', 'ending', 'also', 'quite', 'stunning', 'Even', 'rather', 'standard', 'plot', 'line', 'lovers', 'run', 'Wanda', 'up', 'bank', 'robber', 'last', 'hour', 'film', 'enhanced', 'style', 'substance', 'film', 'slow', 'almost', 'European', 'pacing', 'wonderfully', 'only', 'American', 'film', 'Monte', 'Hellman', 'Two', 'Lane', 'Blacktop', 'American', 'film', 'distinctively', 'European', 'vibe', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'amazingly', 'quiet', 'almost', 'transcendent', 'film', 'shame', 'Barbara', 'Loden', 'died', 'shortly', 'making', 'died', 'cancer', '48', 'only', 'film', 'writer/director', 'get', 'chance', 'should', 'see', 'one', 'soon']",N/A

Part of a short-lived trend of hard-hitting women's films in the early '70s, ""Wanda"" remains compelling for Loden's uncomfortably downcast performance, the gritty 16mm look of its rundown locales, and Higgins's marvelously inscrutable turn as a fledgling bank robber.

998117,A2R1GFS6P1PC18,B000G1QU70,Peter Baklava,"[1, 1]","I caught a showing of this movie on Turner Classic Movies, and it has stayed in my mind ever since.  I think that Barbara Loden's ""Wanda"" must have been an influence on the Coen brothers.Barbara Loden was an actress involved in the pivotal actor's studio in New York City in the 1950's.  She married Elia Kazan, and appeared in the role of Bud's (Warren Beatty's) sister in ""Splendor in the Grass"".  Loden always carried a 'wounded' expression on her face, and in ""Wanda"", which she both directed and starred in, she plays a complete cipher/victim.The cheapness of this production (some of it has the quality of a home movie) would have doomed it to obscurity, but Loden had a strategy of completely avoiding the stereotypical locations most directors would stress, and instead portraying life completely on the periphery of civilization.  This is a strategy I also found used brilliantly in a book by Lynda Barry called ""Cruddy"".  But this is the only film that I've ever watched that approximates the same kind of disorientation, visually.Try to see this sometime if you can.  It's one of a kind.",4,Strangely Haunting,1364515200,"03 29, 2013",2013,1098,"['caught', 'showing', 'movie', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'stayed', 'mind', 'ever', 'think', 'Barbara', 'Loden', 'Wanda', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'influence', 'Coen', 'brothers.Barbara', 'Loden', 'was', 'actress', 'involved', 'pivotal', 'actor', 'studio', 'New', 'York', 'City', '1950', 'married', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'appeared', 'role', 'Bud', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'sister', 'Splendor', 'Grass', 'Loden', 'always', 'carried', ""'wounded"", 'expression', 'face', 'Wanda', 'directed', 'starred', 'complete', 'cipher/victim.The', 'cheapness', 'production', 'quality', 'home', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'doomed', 'obscurity', 'Loden', 'had', 'strategy', 'completely', 'avoiding', 'stereotypical', 'locations', 'most', 'directors', 'would', 'stress', 'instead', 'portraying', 'life', 'completely', 'periphery', 'civilization', 'strategy', 'also', 'found', 'used', 'brilliantly', 'book', 'Lynda', 'Barry', 'called', 'Cruddy', 'only', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'same', 'kind', 'disorientation', 'visually.Try', 'see', 'sometime', 'can', 'one', 'kind']",N/A
998118,A1EHO1C89QIBOT,B000G1QU70,Randy Buck,"[22, 23]","This film's been practially impossible to see for most of its existence -- released for a brief original run in one New York theatre, then, despite many superlative reviews, allowed to sink into obscurity.  Its current DVD incarnation is cause for celebration.  WANDA's writer-director-star, Barbara Loden, was an extremely interesting woman, primarily remembered for her small, vibrant role as Beatty's troubled sister in SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS, and her marriage to that film's director, Elia Kazan.  (Loden also won a Tony as the Monroe figure in Kazan's Lincoln Center production of Miller's AFTER THE FALL.)  She spent years trying to get financing for WANDA, and apparently was angered and embittered by its failure to lead to other directing projects.  Her early death from cancer deprived us of a remarkable talent, as this film proves.  WANDA's long been championed by such French artists as Marguerite Duras and Isabelle Huppert; understandable, since the picture bears more than a passing resemblance to the French New Wave.  Inspired by a newspaper story Loden had read, the film's primarily a character study, not plot-driven.  Loden draws fine work from the other actors (including many non-professionals), and gives a haunting, memorable portrayal in the title role.  With great economy of means (literal and figurative), she gives a performance you won't soon forget.  Fans of independent cinema should grab this one quickly.",5,"Hello, Wanda -- At Last!",1155081600,"08 9, 2006",2006,1439,"['film', 'been', 'practially', 'impossible', 'see', 'most', 'existence', 'released', 'brief', 'original', 'run', 'one', 'New', 'York', 'theatre', 'then', 'many', 'superlative', 'reviews', 'allowed', 'sink', 'obscurity', 'current', 'DVD', 'incarnation', 'cause', 'celebration', 'WANDA', 'writer-director-star', 'Barbara', 'Loden', 'was', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'woman', 'primarily', 'remembered', 'small', 'vibrant', 'role', 'Beatty', 'troubled', 'sister', 'SPLENDOR', 'IN', 'THE', 'GRASS', 'marriage', 'film', 'director', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'Loden', 'also', 'won', 'Tony', 'Monroe', 'figure', 'Kazan', 'Lincoln', 'Center', 'production', 'Miller', 'AFTER', 'THE', 'FALL', 'spent', 'years', 'trying', 'get', 'financing', 'WANDA', 'apparently', 'was', 'angered', 'embittered', 'failure', 'lead', 'other', 'directing', 'projects', 'early', 'death', 'cancer', 'deprived', 'remarkable', 'talent', 'film', 'WANDA', 'long', 'been', 'championed', 'such', 'French', 'artists', 'Marguerite', 'Duras', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'understandable', 'picture', 'more', 'passing', 'resemblance', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'Inspired', 'newspaper', 'story', 'Loden', 'had', 'read', 'film', 'primarily', 'character', 'study', 'not', 'plot-driven', 'Loden', 'fine', 'work', 'other', 'actors', 'including', 'many', 'non-professionals', 'haunting', 'memorable', 'portrayal', 'title', 'role', 'great', 'economy', 'means', 'literal', 'figurative', 'performance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget', 'Fans', 'independent', 'cinema', 'should', 'grab', 'one', 'quickly']",N/A

What a difference a few decades can make.

Wanda then drifts around aimlessly, penniless and seeking shelter. She goes to a seedy bar one night. Once there, Wanda talks the bartender, into giving her some food and a beer, for free. He's nasty to her from the start, but does give her the free food and beer. His name is Mr. Davis. And Wanda goes to his place for a tryst, and a place to stay for the time being.With no where else to go and no plans, Wanda stays with Mr. Davis for a while. He treats Wanda like dirt. He starts ordering her to get his food, calls her 'stupid', slaps her around, and even tells her how to dress. Mr. Davis turns out to be a deranged criminal, who's wanted by the law for murder. So he and Wanda hit the road together, so Davis can evade the cops. But when Mr. Davis wants Wanda to participate in a bank robbery with him, she has to decide if she can go through with it or not.When this movie was made, it was basically unheard of, for a woman to skip-out on her family completely. So in this regard, this movie has quite a cutting-edge plot premise. Wanda is obviously a troubled soul, with very low self-esteem. When asked by Mr. Davis why she abandoned her family, Wanda tells him it's because she's 'no damn good'. Whatever brought on Wanda's intense angst, is never addressed. Wanda appears to be a docile, shy person. And yet, she makes the incredibly brave decision to just ditch her family, and cope alone in a precarious world. One thing is for sure; Wanda is definitely an enigmatic character.The cinematography in this film, is very fascinating. The scenery has a remote, barren quality, which seems to convey the poignancy of Wanda's empty life. This movie is a unique account of one woman's inner turmoil, and her unusual quest to try and resolve it. If you like ground-breaking films that center around complex, female characters, then you're sure to like Wanda.",5,"Quirky, keenly touching character study.",1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,1967,"['Wanda', 'young', 'wife', 'who', 'family', 'losing', 'job', 'never', 'made', 'much', 'money', 'anyhow', 'Wanda', 'then', 'aimlessly', 'penniless', 'seeking', 'shelter', 'seedy', 'bar', 'one', 'night', 'Once', 'there', 'Wanda', 'bartender', 'giving', 'food', 'beer', 'free', 'nasty', 'start', 'give', 'free', 'food', 'beer', 'name', 'Mr.', 'Davis', 'Wanda', 'place', 'tryst', 'place', 'stay', 'time', 'where', 'else', 'go', 'plans', 'Wanda', 'Mr.', 'Davis', 'while', 'Wanda', 'dirt', 'ordering', 'get', 'food', ""'stupid"", 'around', 'even', 'how', 'dress', 'Mr.', 'Davis', 'out', 'be', 'deranged', 'criminal', 'who', 'wanted', 'law', 'murder', 'Wanda', 'hit', 'road', 'together', 'Davis', 'can', 'evade', 'cops', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Davis', 'Wanda', 'participate', 'bank', 'robbery', 'decide', 'can', 'go', 'not.When', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'basically', 'unheard', 'woman', 'skip-out', 'family', 'completely', 'So', 'regard', 'movie', 'quite', 'cutting-edge', 'plot', 'premise', 'Wanda', 'obviously', 'troubled', 'soul', 'very', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'When', 'asked', 'Mr.', 'Davis', 'why', 'abandoned', 'family', 'Wanda', ""'no"", 'damn', 'good', 'brought', 'Wanda', 'intense', 'angst', 'never', 'addressed', 'Wanda', 'be', 'docile', 'shy', 'person', 'yet', 'incredibly', 'brave', 'decision', 'just', 'ditch', 'family', 'cope', 'alone', 'precarious', 'world', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'Wanda', 'definitely', 'enigmatic', 'character.The', 'cinematography', 'film', 'very', 'fascinating', 'scenery', 'remote', 'barren', 'quality', 'convey', 'poignancy', 'Wanda', 'empty', 'life', 'movie', 'unique', 'account', 'one', 'woman', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'unusual', 'quest', 'try', 'resolve', 'like', 'ground-breaking', 'films', 'center', 'complex', 'female', 'characters', 'then', ""'re"", 'sure', 'like', 'Wanda']",N/A
