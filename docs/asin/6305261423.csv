I like Brandon Lee, and I like martial arts movies. But this movie really was more of an 80s action flick than a martial arts movie. The plot line and acting weren't bad for a movie in this genre. Fairly formulaic. And the dubbing is something that you are probably used to if you watch many hong kong movies. But the actual fight scenes tended to be very short, and involved a little too much gun play for what I was hoping was more martial art oriented. Over all I was kinda underwhelmed. If you are just a huge Brandon Lee fan and must own everything he acted in then by all means enjoy. But this definitely isn't on par with the Crow, Rapid Fire, or even Showdown in Little Tokyo.",2,might be for you,1266451200,"02 18, 2010",2010,780,"['bought', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'must', 'say', ""'m"", 'little', 'disappointed', 'like', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'like', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'movie', 'really', 'was', 'more', '80s', 'action', 'flick', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie', 'plot', 'line', 'acting', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'genre', 'Fairly', 'formulaic', 'dubbing', 'something', 'are', 'probably', 'used', 'watch', 'many', 'hong', 'kong', 'movies', 'actual', 'fight', 'scenes', 'tended', 'be', 'very', 'short', 'involved', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'gun', 'play', 'what', 'was', 'hoping', 'was', 'more', 'martial', 'art', 'oriented', 'was', 'kinda', 'underwhelmed', 'are', 'just', 'huge', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'fan', 'must', 'own', 'everything', 'acted', 'then', 'means', 'enjoy', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'par', 'Crow', 'Rapid', 'Fire', 'even', 'Showdown', 'Little', 'Tokyo']",Legacy of Rage

I was actually blown away by how well the story is told.  What I was dissapointed with were the little things like horrible dubbing and lame dialouge at times that got rather annoying.  To top it all off, an almost embarassing cameo from Bolo and really no martial arts action to speak of.  Overall, this is a fine film, it just all depends on what you are expecting to get out of it.Three main reasons I purchased Legacy was for Brandon Lee, Bolo Yeung, and hopefully to see some amazing martial arts action.  I guess I expected some bad dubbing and cheesiness, and oh yes, there's plenty of that here.  But what really blew me away was the story.  Things start out a little boring, but once the plot gets kicking it is actually quite engaging.  You've got Brandon, who is your every day working guy with a girlfriend, and his best buddy Michael, who unknown to Brandon, is just a dirty drug-dealing guy.  Michael sets up Brandon for the murder of a rival dealer, and Brandon gets 8 years of time.  While in prison, Michael harasses Brandon's girlfriend, who has become pregnant with Brandon's son and is asked to leave the country with an older, yet kind, man who has been infatuated with her.  Eight years later, Brandon is set free, and with help of a friend from prison, gets his revenge on Michael, in what is a bloody gun showdown without any martial arts combat whatsoever.Despite the dubbing, which the excellent story actually covers up after awhile, Brandon seems to deliver a solid performance.  It kind of reminded me of his capabilities in The Crow.  However, I was hoping for some good kung fu action like in Rapid Fire, but there were only a couple of scenes of quick one two punches and out.  Speaking of which, Bolo appears near the beginning of the film and challenges Brandon to a fight in the street.  Well, its over as fast as they begin and Bolo doesn't land one punch.  Seemed like such a waste for someone as good as Bolo.To sum it up, you have to go into this film expecting a great story without so much action.  I, on the other hand was hoping for some, and all I got was gun fight action.  If that's your thing, you will love the last 10 minutes, but for kung fun lovers, this is not the film.",3,"[3.5] this is rage, only, without any martial arts combat",1193961600,"11 2, 2007",2007,2316,"['way', 'really', 'very', 'good', 'HK', 'movie', 'many', 'other', 'ways', 'just', 'lacking', 'was', 'actually', 'blown', 'away', 'how', 'well', 'story', 'told', 'What', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'were', 'little', 'things', 'horrible', 'dubbing', 'lame', 'dialouge', 'times', 'got', 'rather', 'annoying', 'top', 'off', 'almost', 'embarassing', 'cameo', 'Bolo', 'really', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'speak', 'Overall', 'fine', 'film', 'just', 'what', 'are', 'expecting', 'get', 'it.Three', 'main', 'reasons', 'purchased', 'Legacy', 'was', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'Bolo', 'Yeung', 'hopefully', 'see', 'amazing', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'guess', 'expected', 'bad', 'dubbing', 'cheesiness', 'oh', 'yes', 'plenty', 'here', 'what', 'really', 'blew', 'away', 'was', 'story', 'Things', 'start', 'out', 'little', 'boring', 'once', 'plot', 'kicking', 'actually', 'quite', 'engaging', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Brandon', 'who', 'day', 'working', 'guy', 'girlfriend', 'best', 'buddy', 'Michael', 'who', 'unknown', 'Brandon', 'just', 'dirty', 'drug-dealing', 'guy', 'Michael', 'up', 'Brandon', 'murder', 'rival', 'dealer', 'Brandon', '8', 'years', 'time', 'prison', 'Michael', 'Brandon', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'become', 'pregnant', 'Brandon', 'son', 'asked', 'leave', 'country', 'older', 'yet', 'kind', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'infatuated', 'Eight', 'years', 'later', 'Brandon', 'set', 'free', 'help', 'friend', 'prison', 'revenge', 'Michael', 'what', 'bloody', 'gun', 'showdown', 'martial', 'arts', 'combat', 'whatsoever.Despite', 'dubbing', 'excellent', 'story', 'actually', 'up', 'awhile', 'Brandon', 'deliver', 'solid', 'performance', 'kind', 'reminded', 'capabilities', 'Crow', 'However', 'was', 'hoping', 'good', 'kung', 'fu', 'action', 'Rapid', 'Fire', 'were', 'only', 'couple', 'scenes', 'quick', 'one', 'two', 'punches', 'out', 'Speaking', 'Bolo', 'beginning', 'film', 'challenges', 'Brandon', 'fight', 'street', 'Well', 'as', 'fast', 'begin', 'Bolo', ""n't"", 'land', 'one', 'punch', 'Seemed', 'waste', 'someone', 'as', 'good', 'Bolo.To', 'sum', 'up', 'have', 'go', 'film', 'expecting', 'great', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'action', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'hoping', 'got', 'was', 'gun', 'fight', 'action', 'thing', 'will', 'love', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'kung', 'fun', 'lovers', 'not', 'film']",Legacy of Rage

The action was there(Brandon stayed true to the Jeet Kune Do method that his dad polished) and while I didn't feel that he was attempting to imitate or emulate his dad...his intensity, mannerisms and even his expressions tend to resemble and honor his dad at times. I strongly recommend LOR for fans of Bruce and Brandon Lee, not just because it's a rare treat(or for the Cantonese soundtrack w/t English subtitles...cool), but because it represents the continuity of the Bruce Lee legacy and gives us more of a glimpse at what may've been(carrying Bruce Lee's torch and coming from under his shadow) had he lived to carry on his father's martial arts/film legacy.

It doesn't really stand out with anything special and is just your average crime drama.  But with Ronny Yu at the helm and Bruce Lee's son as the star, he was going to try to make the best action movie ever.  It is a decent story and well told, but like I said, nothing really happens.  So you may like this if you like seeing a lot of cars blown up and quick one punch and it's over with fights.
