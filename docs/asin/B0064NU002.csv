1510010,A1DH3QDZX8Z7GO,B0064NU002,Charlemange,"[0, 0]","This mockumentary reveals through FBI documents that Elvis is still alive, living under witness protection under an assumed name (Jon Burrows). The premise is not very believable, with the documents arriving to the filmmaker's studio with wet ink on them. The actors are talentless & unconvincing, except for ""Elvis"" who was mostly on point. An audio interview takes place, and Elvis' face is blacked out for his protection. What you mostly see are his hands which are too young looking for a man in his late 70's and the fingers are too stumpy to be the real Elvis'. There is a decently done photoshop ""photo"" of the older Elvis, only to be ruined by a poor cut & paste job.The Q&A; section reveals some trivia about Elvis, much of which is true, with urban legends and ridiculous conspiracy theories thrown in. The editing during the interview was well done, probably the most professional looking part of this project. Key points of Elvis' career, life and death are covered, including the death of the two young girls who were killed by an angry drunk driver during the memorial outside Graceland. A part they left out that would have been interesting, is that there was a third young lady who was run over and survived. A man rushed to her side at the scene of the crime, and wound up harassing her for years, until he was finally sent away by the girl's father & brother. In the 1990's,  the man wound up on death row for killing a young girl.The thing that is really disappointing about this film, is that it tried to draw in fans of Elvis to push an absurd political agenda towards the end. It is totally out of place with the rest of the interview and was the most annoying part besides seeing the dork interviewer putting his hands all over Jon Burrow's nice Cadillac like a cretin.Anyway, this was something different and might be something for Elvis fans who won't take it too seriously. I was really confused by the appearance of Celeste Yarnall in this. Maybe she is related to one of the filmmakers, or else why would she agree to appear?

Most of my many reviews are of non controversial items.  So when I review a so called controversial  book I do so from a conservative Christian viewpoint and there are people who love to bash anything conservative or Christian.  It never fails to amaze me how people can give one star reviews bout books and DVDs that have just been released and it is so obvious that the book has not been read and the DVD not  viewed.  Well, I have recommended this DVD in a mass emailing and on Facebook.  So haters out there may wish to skip this review.  Those with no set opinions are invited to read on whether they agree or disagree.  I recommend this DVD for the very simple reason I gave in the subject title, there is definitely a message here.The very brilliant  actress Celeste Yarnall  put me on to this DVD admitting it is a ""Mockumentary.""  Yes, that is the right word.  It is a documentary titled ""Elvis Found Alive"" and it is so well done that for a bit I was very close to believing Elvis is alive. I must state that I am not a conspiracy buff.  The DVD is well done in covering the life of Elvis Presley, but after an hour of enthralling information from 1935 to 1977 there is evidence shown that his death was faked and he has been in witness protection off and on while working for the DEA.  The information about Elvis's early life comes from well documented films and the very words he has said himself.  The narrator is the supposed Elvis, however he is so good you want to believe.The purpose of this DVD is not to promote that the king is still alive.  There is TV news coverage of the turbulent sixties and seventies and the rise of Bill Ayers.  The true evil Elvis works against.  The purpose by the end of the film is showing Bill Ayers as the puppet master behind Barack Hussein Obama and a plan to destroy America. There is so much information that this retired history/government teacher and observer knows, from his own research over the years, is very true about what is going on today.  I would recommend this film primarily to introduce viewers to what may be the hidden purpose of it.  To reveal what we are faced with today and why President Obama must be voted out of office.  The rightful concerns that honest people have about Bill Ayers and the Chicago Mafia, concerns over the Obama desire to turn us into a socialist/communist nation.  This is too true and too real.This DVD is not a scam.  It is a real look at the Elvis we once knew, who Celeste Yarnall knew very well, and concerns he had about the direction our country was going in as early as the late sixties and through the seventies.  The king is not dead in spirit and we do honor to his memory  to heed the things that he saw we were losing in America.  The election in November is a contest that will save or lose the soul of the United States.  Ah, I can hear the cries of outrage from the liberal socialist haters now and actually I am not bothered.  Even if less than one percent of them is made to think by this DVD, then it will have been well worth it.God bless the memory of Elvis Presley, those who put this DVD  together and the USA.",5,Definitely a message here.,1327708800,"01 28, 2012",2012,3273,"['might', 'as', 'well', 'know', 'first', 'hand', 'do', 'not', 'read', 'comments', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'up', 'front', 'not', 'notify', 'such', 'contacts', 'Most', 'many', 'reviews', 'are', 'non', 'controversial', 'items', 'when', 'review', 'so', 'called', 'controversial', 'book', 'do', 'so', 'conservative', 'Christian', 'viewpoint', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'bash', 'anything', 'conservative', 'Christian', 'never', 'amaze', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'give', 'one', 'star', 'books', 'DVDs', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'so', 'obvious', 'book', 'not', 'been', 'read', 'DVD', 'not', 'viewed', 'Well', 'have', 'recommended', 'DVD', 'mass', 'emailing', 'Facebook', 'So', 'may', 'wish', 'skip', 'review', 'set', 'opinions', 'are', 'invited', 'read', 'agree', 'disagree', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'very', 'simple', 'reason', 'gave', 'subject', 'title', 'definitely', 'message', 'here.The', 'very', 'brilliant', 'actress', 'Celeste', 'Yarnall', 'put', 'DVD', 'admitting', 'Mockumentary', 'Yes', 'right', 'word', 'documentary', 'titled', 'Elvis', 'Found', 'Alive', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'bit', 'was', 'very', 'close', 'believing', 'Elvis', 'alive', 'must', 'state', 'am', 'not', 'conspiracy', 'buff', 'DVD', 'well', 'done', 'covering', 'life', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'hour', 'enthralling', 'information', '1935', '1977', 'evidence', 'shown', 'death', 'was', 'faked', 'been', 'witness', 'protection', 'working', 'DEA', 'information', 'Elvis', 'early', 'life', 'well', 'documented', 'films', 'very', 'words', 'said', 'narrator', 'supposed', 'Elvis', 'however', 'so', 'good', 'want', 'believe.The', 'purpose', 'DVD', 'not', 'promote', 'king', 'still', 'alive', 'TV', 'news', 'coverage', 'turbulent', 'sixties', 'seventies', 'rise', 'Bill', 'Ayers', 'true', 'evil', 'Elvis', 'works', 'purpose', 'end', 'film', 'showing', 'Bill', 'Ayers', 'puppet', 'master', 'Barack', 'Hussein', 'Obama', 'plan', 'destroy', 'America', 'so', 'much', 'information', 'retired', 'history/government', 'teacher', 'observer', 'knows', 'own', 'research', 'years', 'very', 'true', 'what', 'going', 'today', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'primarily', 'introduce', 'viewers', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'hidden', 'purpose', 'reveal', 'what', 'are', 'faced', 'today', 'why', 'President', 'Obama', 'must', 'be', 'voted', 'office', 'rightful', 'concerns', 'honest', 'people', 'have', 'Bill', 'Ayers', 'Chicago', 'Mafia', 'Obama', 'desire', 'turn', 'socialist/communist', 'nation', 'too', 'true', 'too', 'real.This', 'DVD', 'not', 'scam', 'real', 'look', 'Elvis', 'once', 'knew', 'who', 'Celeste', 'Yarnall', 'knew', 'very', 'well', 'concerns', 'had', 'direction', 'country', 'was', 'going', 'as', 'early', 'late', 'sixties', 'seventies', 'king', 'not', 'dead', 'spirit', 'do', 'honor', 'memory', 'heed', 'things', 'saw', 'were', 'losing', 'America', 'election', 'November', 'contest', 'will', 'save', 'lose', 'soul', 'United', 'States', 'Ah', 'can', 'hear', 'cries', 'outrage', 'liberal', 'socialist', 'haters', 'now', 'actually', 'am', 'not', 'bothered', 'Even', 'less', 'one', 'percent', 'made', 'think', 'DVD', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'worth', 'it.God', 'memory', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'who', 'put', 'DVD', 'together', 'USA']",Elvis Found Alive

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[2, 4]","Let me clear this up right away: I have no idea of whether or not Elvis Presley - the King of Rock'n'Roll, thank you very much - is alive or dead.  Well ... let me clear that up right away, too: I have no way of p-r-o-v-i-n-g whether or not Elvis is alive or dead.  Do I have an opinion one way or the other?  Not so much.  But, as someone who generally loves conspiracies and/or conspiracy-fueled projects, I'm aware that there have been quite a few handful of folks who've come forward alleging to have seen the King alive and well - albeit a bit worse for wear than when we last saw him; and ELVIS FOUND ALIVE perhaps serves to keep rumors of the King's survival front-and-center.Growing up, I was never a fan of Presley's, but that wasn't his fault.  Mostly, it was because my mother, my aunts, my grandmother ... they worshipped at Elvis's feet.  Every time an Elvis movie came on television, I knew what channel the set was going to be tuned to.  Oh, the flicks were innocuous enough, clearly harmless patter built around the basic idea of having the King do yet one more number.  I don't think being forced to endure such `torture' harmed me in any way.  In fact, as I grew older, I found that I actually appreciated Elvis's voice.  Well, not so much what was featured in so many of those bad movies ... but, clearly, the man knew how to give a song his own personal stamp.  Obviously, he knew how to croon.  It goes without saying that he knew how to rock.  To my surprise, he even could shake the heavens with some quality gospel.  Those movie numbers?  Meh.  Nothing much to get excited about, even though mom and the ladies always thought different.When he died - or should I say ""when we were led to believe he died"" - the nation was understandably all shook up.  Such is the nature of celebrity deaths: culturally, we attach so much significance to the performers that we adore that, in our own minds, they're never really gone.  We define `who we are' by our various favorites in music, movies, and books.  We emulate their hair-styles, we want to wear the clothes and capture they look they have.  Of course, they're never really gone!  They've simply stopped touring!  Well, love me tender if the stories of his continued existence didn't breathe life into the growing Elvis subculture for about a decade ... but then they just vanished.Highway 61 Entertainment would have you believe that the King is alive, well, and - of all places - living in California, and ELVIS FOUND ALIVE makes for great entertainment if THE X FILES was a particular fascination of yours.  The ""documentary"" mines a fair amount of the King's legacy - perhaps giving new explanations for some of the events of his life, as well as some of the choices he made so much a part of his public personae.  All of it - and I do mean all of it - is predicated on some very real and well-established facts about his life, and no one less than the King himself (though distorted here for the purposes of ... uh ... protecting his identity?) narrates the wealth of information disclosed here, even going so far as to give legitimate reasons why he can't go public about the faking of his death.  If you're even mildly curious about what could've happened, then ELVIS FOUND ALIVE is worth a view, though I doubt you'll give it a second pass on the DVD player.  If you're - like my mom, her sisters, and any other baby boomer gal - an Elvis fan, then put on your blue suede shoes and get yourself down to the corner video store and rent this disk today!  You'll be glad you did - not so much because you'll believe all of it, but because you'll probably enjoy a post-seventy-year-old Elvis reflecting back on the phenomenon he was at the height of his career.Now, I will throw in a cautious disclaimer: there is a companion product to the DVD - there is a studio production of the King himself singing some new songs, available if you act now for the low, low price of ...  Much ado has been made about whether or not this DVD production is little more than an infomercial to hawk another product (the CD).  Was that wrong?  Well, I'm not so sure.  It seems like a harmless diversion, at best: would an all-new Elvis recording seriously jeopardize the success of Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, and Justin Beiber today?  Meh.  I hate to admit that it probably wouldn't.  Still, I can understand anyone's reservation in granting ELVIS FOUND ALIVE any measure of legitimacy given the fact that maybe - just maybe - it tries to capitalize on Elvis even though it may not be Elvis.  That's why I said this was a cautious disclaimer: I've always said I have no way of knowing or proving any of this ... but I enjoyed it for what it was, and there ain't anything wrong with that.The DVD has been produced by Highway 61 Entertainment, and the production quality is acceptable throughout.  It ain't anything grand or perfect - certainly not all of it is befitting a King - but it works just fine for me.  The sound quality was solid.  The special features do highlight the CD tracks - giving brief samples of what's available.RECOMMENDED.  Don't be cruel.  Watching this one won't leave you lonesome tonight.  Even today, we still can't help falling in love with you, Elvis.  Please forgive our suspicious minds.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to share that the fine folks at Highway 61 Entertainment provided me with a DVD screener copy of ELVIS FOUND ALIVE for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,"Ladies and Gentlemen, ELVIS Has Returned to the Building?",1334448000,"04 15, 2012",2012,5482,"['Let', 'clear', 'up', 'right', 'away', 'have', 'idea',

Elvis also used the name ""Jon Burrows"" while he was on tour and later as his status as a ""special assistant"" to the BNDD the forerunner of DEA.(Credentials given to him by President Richard Nixon at the White House in 1972, my former work place in 1974-1977)I was originally just looking at 50's music when I came across Linda Sigmon's website by mistake. I was very interested as all the facts seem to indicate Elvis ""may"" still be alive, but there are many discrepancies.I have seen this DVD by Joel Gabriel and reviewed all the facts which are interesting but lacking in fact or truth and policies and procedures with regards to FOIA and many other procedures referred to by the alleged ""Elvis"" in the DVD and producer Joel Gabriel.Ultimately, I talked to people in my former agency at U.S. Secret Service and agents who actually worked on Reagan's detail DENIED any contacts or photo sessions with Elvis Presley and Reagan during the time of his presidency. (Photo shop was indicated by the agent) Even agents of the association of former Secret service agents denied that Elvis was alive and that the DVD was faked with photos that were photo shopped.I also checked with the White House and Press Corps and they have no record of the photos of Jimmy Carter with Elvis Presley who later asked for special presidential protection which Carter ""allegedly denied. (This in itself is inaccurate as the President can order ""protection"" for any individual he so chooses under Executive Orders. In this Faked DVD, Elvis was denied by Carter claiming he had no authority. This makes it look as if Carter lied and this is not the truth)There was a statement from Linda Sigmon and ""Jesse""(aka Elvis) claiming the DVD was good and to purchase it. Then later claimed the DVD was after all a ""FAKE"" and apologized for it including the alleged Jesse aka Elvis who claimed he was ""extorted into doing this DVD. (also a fake/hoax, otherwise why didn't he report this to the police or FBI??)Finally, I decided to ask some people I knew to do a ""forensic"" voice analysis to prove one way or another if this was really Elvis aka Jesse aka Jon Burrows in Simi Valley. So far the tests derived directly from the DVD ""Elvis Found Alive"" and compared with other ""known"" recordings of the real Elvis prove it is a fake(The test resulted on only 56% of the fake voice when you need 80% or better. So it appears to be a very good impersonator's voice)Further tests are pending now.(See Easy Voice Bio-metrics Below)************EVB FINAL TEST Results: March 29, 2012 BEGIN: The EVB Forensic test results are NOT positive for the alleged Elvis (impersonator)voice on the DVD. Here's what the EVB forensic technician said: ""I ran the test on these new files.""(including the Gail Brewer-Giorgio tape of 1988)""Sorry, but it's NOT Elvis in the unknown file in my opinion.""""I started with 8 known Elvis files - named interview and interview 1, 2, etc up to 7.""I have one unknown Elvis file.""""When comparing the unknown to ALL the knowns - the best we get is about a 56% match.""""When comparing a known to all the other knowns - I get 80% plus match showing it is very likely him - as we know.""""If I add recordings of my own voice to the list to be tested, I also get about a 55% match of my voice with the unknown Elvis - and I know I'm not Elvis.""""So, therefore based on the EVB forensics tool, I'd have to say it's NOT him.""

1510024,A1NAS49A6LFCYB,B0064NU002,Johnny Apollo,"[1, 3]","I give this mockumentary a solid 3 star for a B-movie. This is a low budget spoof and is never meant to be taken seriously. It is both humerous and scarey how folks are negatively reacting to this film. Elvis was a mortal, people. He died 35 years ago...I bought this DVD new for $5.99 at a 1/2 price book store. We watched it once and that will probably do it for us. This movie starts off bad but gets a little better and becomes somewhat entertaining although parts of it are silly. There is a constant superhero reference that ""cheese-i-fied"" an already cheesy movie. Had they not included this AND had some better actors & script, I might have given this film a 4 star(for a B-movie). The actor that played Elvis(yes it was not really Him...)was pretty good/acceptable, considering they never showed ""Him"". I know that there are some pretty hardcore Elvis fans (Elvis worshippers?) out there, but part of the entertainment for me was to remember these 1 star reviews while watching this film. I like all kinds of music including Elvis and I even own 4 Elvis concert DVD's but I think people go wayyy overboard as is the case with the ""how dare you"" reactions to this little film. Priscilla gets ""dissed"" a bit but IMO, if anyone should be upset, it might be the Sinatra family as Francis Albert Sinatra's alleged mafia or mobster ties are referenced repeatedly throughout this masterpiece. My guess is that the Sinatra family won't be filing any lawsuits anytime soon, CAUSE IT'S ONLY A CHEESY LOWBUDGET SPOOF, people.I suggest borrowing or renting this one or you can just have mine.

Is it all true - probably not - but it sure has been all thought through carefully enough to make you want to believe it is and the constant intercutting with real life footage recalls such films as JFK and Nixon. You even get to hear the King belt out some new songs - included is a moving pop video to his daughter. Also of interest is Elvis' beliefs about how Obama became president and that because of those beliefs Elvis would only attempt a public comeback if Obama didn't get re-elected - that of course didn't happen and Obama remains in the white house and Elvis' comeback will have to remain on hold until there's a new president in town.

The exposed info reveals that Elvis is still alive and living under the assumed name of Jon Burrows. In more imaginative hands, this could have been an entertaining movie. What this project turns out to be is a lengthy and bloated plug for a &#8220;soundtrack&#8221; featuring an Elvis sound-alike (do we really need to hear Elvis sing &#8220;Wanna Be Starting Something,&#8221; or &#8220;Every Breath You Take&#8221;).At more than two hours, the &#8220;documentary&#8221; really drags during the first hour. It&#8217;s basically a retelling of Elvis&#8217; life from his birth to his supposed death. Only in the second hour does the pace pick up, and that&#8217;s primarily due to the many outrageous scenarios described by &#8220;Elvis.&#8221;  &#8220;He&#8221; claims to have been an undercover agent for the DEA and helped to bring down the Mafia, the &#8217;70s political group the Weathermen, and was even involved with 9/11. There are other extreme claims, like Bill Clinton was at Elvis&#8217; &#8220;funeral,&#8221; and the whole faked funeral was organized by Dr. Nick (details of the plot are provided).Also, throughout the two hours there was ridiculous dialogue that had Elvis stating he wanted to be like Captain Marvel Jr., and that all the women in his life either needed to, or did, resemble Mary Marvel. The way this was presented came off as creepy. Elvis may have liked comic books, but I found this insulting to Elvis&#8217; memory.Most of us agree that Elvis died way too young, and it&#8217;s still difficult to comprehend how he let himself go. As much as we would like to have him with us, he is in gone &#8211; but certainly not forgotten!!If you feel you must see this project, find somebody who has already parted with their hard earned money.

Kelly ""Rexangelion""","[16, 28]","I completely disagree with the opinions of 'O Henry' and 'Michael Kopec', posted December 13 and 20 - 2011, respectively, and the first two opinions posted about this insightful and probably and mostly true documentary movie.I finished watching this documentary-expose on pay-per-view on December 31, 2011, and pre-ordered the DVD from Amazon that same night. Ever since that fateful day of August 16, 1977, I have maintained a theory that Elvis died of suicide to escape the intolerable pain of living here, and only God knows how much pain he endured from Colonel Tom Parker and a host of other users. I never shared the opinions of the 'Elvis is Alive Fan Club' and often even made jokes about them.What I am skeptical of in this documentary is the version of how the documentary film team actually came upon the knowledge that Elvis is alive, is in the Federal Witness Protection program and living in California under the name of Jon Burrows. I am more inclined to believe that Elvis, himself, wanted to reveal and let the world know that he is still alive and as much of the facts and circumstances concerning his faked death as he is lawfully allowed to do. I am also more inclined to believe that everything leading up to his 'darkened room' interview as shown in the documentary was contrived between Elvis, certain Federal authorities and the film crew, in similar manner to his contrived death. After that point, the interview takes us back to entire review of Elvis' life and what really went on until as late as early 2011. Most all of it is very believable to me. USSR Premier Nikita Khrushchev's comment in 1956 that ""We will bury you!"" is a haunting reminder of what is and has been going on in this world against America for many years as confirmed by the Elvis interview in this documentary.There is so much more that I could say about this movie, but why not let the future viewers decide for themselves as the evidence is all around US right now that the world is controlled by a greedy and criminal 'Mobster-Gangster-Monster Mindset'. There has never been a time before US that the ENTIRE world is consumed by corruption and greed on an unimaginable scale and rightly confirmed by the Elvis interview. It all makes so much since as we move toward a New Age under the True Christ-Messiah. I truly believe that this documentary has been timed to be released for the year 2012 as we move toward the eternally defining presidential election and the fulfillment of an ancient 2012 prophesy in a manner that clarifies itself more and more each day.Lastly, I would like to go back and show why I so adamantly disagree with 'O Henry's' and ""Michael Kopec's' opinions. First, the definition of a 'Documentary' is:1. Consisting of, concerning, or based on documents.2. Presenting facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter, as in a book or film.3. A work, such as a film or television program, presenting political, social, or historical subject matter in a factual and informative manner and often consisting of actual news films or interviews accompanied by narration.Given that let me say that the film makers and producers of this movie depict it as a documentary and in no way have they or did they insert any disclaimer in the movie that it was a work of fiction meant only to entertain its viewers, and that is very important. Because if this is a work of fiction, but delivered as a documentary for payment per view or a DVD copy to audiences in the United States and the world, the producers are subject to CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FOR FRAUD under numerous domestic and international laws and more specifically the Federal Law on wire fraud, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343. The elements of wire fraud are the same as mail fraud. In order to convict the defendant, federal prosecutions have to prove all of the following beyond a reasonable doubt:1. A scheme to defraud or obtain money or property by fraudulent pretenses.2. Intent.3. The making of materially false representations.4. Transmission by wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce.Producers and filmmakers are not certain fools that would willfully and intentionally break such laws for minimal profits. And more specifically the Hollywood producers who are the 'Masters' of the spy and espionage thrillers certainly know how easy it would be for an antagonist of this movie to have electronic-digital voice analysis' done and compared between 'Elvis'' voice in this documentary and the 'Elvis' voice of pre-08-16-1977, in an effort to prove the movie is fiction and contrived and certainly not factual. Remember a person's voice is like their fingerprints and DNA - singular and unique to 99.9999+ percentile.",5,"Mmmm, so the ""Elvis is Alive!

The folks at Highway 61 Entertainment are LOUSY actors but the actor playing Elvis did a great job.  Just about all of the post-death storylines of Elvis' life were a bit laughable (FBI, DEA, meeting Presidents) but I truly enjoyed the clarity of the fictions.  I even loved how they wove the Obama presidency into the film.  Too bad Highway 61 missed the mark with Celeste Yarnall.  If she had collapsed sobbing when meeting Elvis the selling factor would have soared a hundred-fold.  Her eyes barely got wet.

He has a good voice and knows how to phrase things as Elvis would.Now, onto the film:The first 10 minutes of the film are lousy and goofy. I worried that the film would be a piece of crap. However, once the documentary film crew sits down with ""Elvis"", things pick up steam.The beginning of the interview with Elvis has him recounting his early life and then his success in the music business. This section of the film is actually a good true-to-the-facts documentary of Elvis's life written by some people who know their stuff. If this section of the film had been released as a stand-alone video biography, it would be worth seeing on its own.The final section of the interview is what really pulled me in, but had my wife rolling her eyes. I think you have to be an Elvis fan to enjoy the final section of the film.Basically the filmmakers describe, through their interview with Elvis, how Elvis might have survived his reported death. They also take what was known about Elvis' political leanings and extrapolate what side of the culture wars he'd currently fall on.I thought, knowing a hell of a lot about Elvis, that the filmmakers did a good job mixing fact and speculation. Despite knowing a lot about Elvis, I sometimes wondered at what point the facts ended and the fiction began.This film has specific relevance to the current age because Elvis was basically a law enforcement junkie who didn't have a lot of love for hippies, or radical extremists like the Weathermen. In this film, Elvis has a special distaste for the head of the Weathermen who is (no kidding - look it up) a mentor to Obama. Elvis doesn't have much good to say about the republicans or the democrats, but he has it in for the Obama administration and their ties to the radical left. I thought that this was a pretty good read of Elvis' politics.A very good and head-spinning trip for those of us who know the Elvis story well.P.S.
