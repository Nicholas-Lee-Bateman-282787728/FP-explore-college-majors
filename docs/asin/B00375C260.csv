This contests attracts a few hopefuls and  has the film giving us a brief introduction to these contestants at the beginning of the movie.These characters briefly are Shabana Azmi who wants to win the contest at any costs so that she can donate the money to charity and earn bragging rights with her socialite friends.Isshita Sharma a 17 year brilliant student who wants to pursue a career in arts despite her parents wishes, who want her to study medicine or engineering.Seema Rahmani, who does not speak a word of Hindi and her rendition of Bole Chudiyan towards the end of the movie.The director, Manish Acharya, himself who plays a futures analyst who wants to win the contest so that he can tide himself over until he finds a new job.The promoter who wants to make a career in event management and Ajay Naidu starring a Turbanotorious BDG a rapper, these are the characters that make the movie lively.The white guy Michael Raimondi who is besotted with India and his Indian girlfriend played by Ayesha Dharker,This may not be a movie with big stars but the script is pleasant and there are many moments that will keep you entertained. The music is not too bad either. I gave it three stars and enjoyed it. 5/26/10",3,Fun,1275091200,"05 29, 2010",2010,1547,"['small', 'movie', 'been', 'made', 'NRI', 'thus', 'should', 'appeal', 'film', 'combination', 'many', 'moments', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'classic', 'movie', 'moving', 'keep', 'entertained.Loins', 'Punjab', 'meat', 'processor', 'pork', 'loins', 'sponsor', 'three', 'day', 'singing', 'contest', 'New', 'Jersey', 'singing', 'hopefuls', 'few', 'hopefuls', 'film', 'giving', 'brief', 'introduction', 'contestants', 'beginning', 'movie.These', 'characters', 'briefly', 'are', 'Shabana', 'Azmi', 'who', 'win', 'contest', 'costs', 'can', 'donate', 'money', 'charity', 'earn', 'bragging', 'rights', 'socialite', 'friends.Isshita', 'Sharma', '17', 'year', 'brilliant', 'student', 'who', 'pursue', 'career', 'arts', 'parents', 'wishes', 'who', 'want', 'study', 'medicine', 'engineering.Seema', 'Rahmani', 'who', 'not', 'speak', 'word', 'Hindi', 'rendition', 'Bole', 'Chudiyan', 'end', 'movie.The', 'director', 'Manish', 'Acharya', 'who', 'futures', 'analyst', 'who', 'win', 'contest', 'so', 'can', 'tide', 'new', 'job.The', 'promoter', 'who', 'make', 'career', 'event', 'management', 'Ajay', 'Naidu', 'starring', 'Turbanotorious', 'BDG', 'rapper', 'are', 'characters', 'make', 'movie', 'white', 'guy', 'Michael', 'Raimondi', 'who', 'besotted', 'India', 'Indian', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Ayesha', 'Dharker', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'movie', 'big', 'stars', 'script', 'pleasant', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'will', 'keep', 'entertained', 'music', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'either', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'enjoyed', '5/26/10']",N/A

This has fewer laughs, but more heart.A `Desi Idol' Hindi singing contest is sponsored by a meat company in New Jersey(hence the title).
