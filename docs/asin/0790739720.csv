However, read comments below.1999 review: The bleak Texas landscape is as much an actor in the movie as the cast.  As I watched Ryan Phillippe act his part I could not help but think that I was seeing a new James Dean.  Too bad his part in ""54"" was  rewritten so badly.  I would have liked to see what he could have done with  it after seeing him here.  But the real stars here are the boys who play  his brothers.  Where did they find such believable youngsters?  This is a  movie to watch again and again, even if you are haunted by each viewing!2006: Comment on the U.S. DVD: The DVD as released in the U.S. has been re-framed from the VHS and without a lot of care for the content. In a powerful scene where Ryan Phillippe is walking away into the darkness ""naked"" and humiliated, carrying his clothes in his arms, the top edge of the waistband of some shorts he was actually wearing in the scene which were outside the frame are now visible in the frame. In the VHS version you believed he was naked and humiliated. Now you know he wasn't there but then is in the distant shot that follows. Bad move! While it is great to have the film on a domestic CD -- it was available under the title Wait Until Dawn as a Region 2 German DVD -- greater care should have been taken with this release.Still one of the best things Mr. Phillippe, or anyone else, has done.

This is an  unusual and troubling film.  The story is set in modern day rural Texas.  It follows the very dysfunctional lives of the West family. Mom &amp; Dad  own and operate a small town bar. The family history is deep and haunting  and the movie leaves you in shadows as you try to piece together this  emotional drama. If I told you too many secrets, it would take away from  the suspense and surprise of the movie. I will say it is quite violent  and/or sexual at times and it does not end on a happy &quot;Brady  Bunch&quot; style note.  The story and acting is good, but the plot and  suspense is excellent. Hence I rated the film a 4. It won several awards  at smaller film festivals. Although I have not seen &quot;American  Beauty&quot; yet, I am thinking &quot;Little Boy Blue&quot; is somewhat  similar in it's dysfunction, only &quot;American Beauty&quot; had more  money to throw at the film. Isn't Hollywood great? &quot;Little Boy  Blue&quot; also stars Nastassja Kinski and features 2 fine young actors  playing the part of Jimmy's (Ryan Phillipe) siblings.
