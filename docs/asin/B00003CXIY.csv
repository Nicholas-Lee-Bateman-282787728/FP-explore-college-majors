526778,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXIY,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","If you just want to sit back and laugh at the most ridiculously insulting and rather audacious attempts at trashy humor, then this film is for you.  In the long line of teenage romp/coms, this one is certainly not the worst.  I don't understand why these senseless sex comedies are so popular (or at least WERE so popular back in the late 90's, early 00's) but for whatever reason they were being released regularly every three months or so.I blame `American Pie', which in retrospect isn't really all that funny.The thing with these films is that they go absolutely nowhere and serve absolutely no purpose.This film centers around a group of guys who take a road trip (thus the name of the film) from Ithaca to Austin when one of the group accidentally mails a sex tape (with another chick) to his girlfriend.  Along the way they have some outrageous (and yes, comical) adventures.This was the birth of DJ Quails brief fame.  He is actually pretty funny in that ""OH MY GOD HE IS FUNNY TO LOOK AT"" kind of humor.  Everything he does has an extra layer of hilarity because he is so unattractive.  This was also made when Seann William Scott was a hot commodity (thank god that is over) and when Amy Smart was the hot young thing (where is she now?) and Tom Green was famous.  Yes, Tom Green was famous.  Breckin Meyer is the real star here, and he has that suave quality about him that makes him likable and watchable.  Sadly, his career went nowhere either.Andy Dick is gross, but he always makes me laugh so I'm glad he's here.Anyways, this will entertain, even if it won't stay with you.  You won't remember this tomorrow, but you'll laugh pretty hard tonight.  What else could you hope to want from something as ridiculous as `Road Trip'?I was planning on giving this film a D (which would have been two stars) but I kept hearing Seann William Scott whispering in my ear...""Did I say two?

But fortunately I was wrong about this hilarious movie. Road Trip is about an average college guy, Josh (played by Breckin Meyer), who chases down a videotape recording of him cheating on his girlfriend (Rachel Blanchard) with the beautiful Beth (Amy Smart). This video is accidentally  sent to his girlfriend, who goes to school half-way across the country, thus inspiring a road trip to retrieve the tape before his girlfriend views it. While Barry (Tom Green) stays back at the dorms to feed a live mouse to Rubin's pet snake, Josh and his three friend Kyle, Rubin, and E.L. embark on their long trip.  As Josh and his hilarious friends travel across the country to save his long-distance relationship, they have many laughs and adventures, and along their journey they all realize important things about themselves which makes this movie end with a sort of reassuring, happy sigh.  Some of the deleted scenes are really funny.

I figured it would tread the same line as the American Pie movies.  I found it, however, very disappointing.  I've never been a fan of Tom Green.  His patent &quot;Confused stare&quot; is stomach churning.  An accidental genious, if you will, and I am glad America has woken up from their hypnotized state that he had over them.  All the other characters are unlikeable.  The pot head kid is an arrogant, self-serving, character that is too smart for his own good.  DJ Qualls is too whiny in the beginning and then is too full of himself at the end.  Sean William Scott tries but fails to save this movie by delivering a second-rate Stifler.  The ending feels too much like a cop out.  Breckin Meyer gets saved because of Tom Green's stupidity.  If only Tom Green would have taped over Paris Hilton's tape.

""Road Trip"" tells the story of Josh (Breckin Myer) is a college dude who abandons his studies but has remained faithful to his girlfriend (Rachel Blanchard). That is, until one night, his friend (Sean William Scott, essentially reprising his role as Stifler from ""American Pie"" as a jerk who makes fun of virgins) invites him to a party. This is where he meets Beth (Amy Smart). That night, they make a sex tape. However, Josh feels bad and tells his friend Barry Manilow (Tom Green) to mail his love message to his real girlfriend to her dorm in Austin. However, he sends the sex tape. Josh and company go on a road trip to retrieve the sex tape and save his relationship.

526786,A3LVA6QDZIOBGE,B00003CXIY,Ashegam,"[3, 4]","Tears pages from a ton of different movies successes, but it is still pretty funny.The movie's concept is a definite rip - a movie I just saw about a week ago documents the same thing - a guy sends his college girlfriend the infamous 'sex tape' and then tries to get to her to get the tape back. The movie starred Paul Rudd and Reese Witherspoon and was called &quot;Overnight Delivery.&quot;This movie's unique quality would be the diversity of its actors - it seems to be a much more diverse casting than the 'teen dream' castings of American Pie (which featured some of the most attractive teens in America 'stuck' as virgins) and She's All That (which pinned Rachael Leigh Cook as the 'ugly girl' - are you kidding????). This movie features an 'ugly guy' who - apologies to DJ Qualls - is actually not that attractive. The movie also seems to try and capitalize on Tom Green's popularity - it almost seems like they expanded his part, or even added his part, due to his growing popularity due to his hilarious MTV show. Breckin Meyer was great as Josh and Seann William Scott continues playing the jerk/jock role very well. Andy Dick is absolutely hilarious as well as very unrecognizable, hotel clerk.The script isn't that creative, but it does have some highs, but with the highs come some lows. There were some parts that dragged - Green's character Barry telling the story - although essential to the story, seemed a bit more than necessary. The movie was quick - less than an hour and 20 minutes - but it worked in most parts, but the ending could have been expanded at the end. I don't want to spoil the ending, but if you watch the film, you'll notice that everything seems to change in the blink of an eye.There was great deal of nudity - which surprised me - and I've heard Amy Smart was not very well briefed for the extent of her nudity. But she said that later she understood and it worked with the role.Overall, it was definitely a better teen movie than the past few months have seen (Whatever It Takes) - but still didn't have that classic element that American Pie truly grasped.",3,I've been on better trips,976579200,"12 12, 2000",2000,2099,"['Tears', 'pages', 'ton', 'different', 'movies', 'successes', 'still', 'pretty', 'funny.The', 'movie', 'concept', 'definite', 'rip', 'movie', 'just', 'saw', 'week', 'documents', 'same', 'thing', 'guy', 'college', 'girlfriend', 'infamous', 'tape', 'then', 'tries', 'get', 'get', 'tape', 'back', 'movie', 'starred', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'was', 'called', 'quot', 'Overnight', 'Delivery.', 'quot', 'movie', 'unique', 'quality', 'would', 'be', 'diversity', 'actors', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'diverse', 'casting', ""'teen"", 'dream', 'castings', 'American', 'Pie', 'featured', 'most', 'attractive', 'teens', 'America', ""'stuck"", 'virgins', 'pinned', 'Rachael', 'Leigh', 'Cook', ""'ugly"", 'girl', 'are', 'kidding', 'movie', ""'ugly"", 'guy', 'who', 'apologies', 'DJ', 'Qualls', 'actually', 'not', 'attractive', 'movie', 'also', 'try', 'capitalize', 'Tom', 'Green', 'popularity', 'almost', 'expanded', 'part', 'even', 'added', 'part', 'due', 'growing', 'popularity', 'due', 'hilarious', 'MTV', 'show', 'Breckin', 'Meyer', 'was', 'great', 'Josh', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'playing', 'jerk/jock', 'role', 'very', 'well', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'unrecognizable', 'hotel', 'clerk.The', 'script', ""n't"", 'that', 'creative', 'have', 'highs', 'highs', 'come', 'lows', 'were', 'parts', 'dragged', 'Green', 'character', 'Barry', 'telling', 'story', 'essential', 'story', 'seemed', 'bit', 'more', 'necessary', 'movie', 'was', 'quick', 'less', 'hour', '20', 'minutes', 'worked', 'most', 'parts', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'expanded', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'ending', 'watch', 'film', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'everything', 'change', 'blink', 'eye.There', 'was', 'great', 'deal', 'nudity', 'surprised', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'briefed', 'extent', 'nudity', 'said', 'later', 'understood', 'worked', 'role.Overall', 'was', 'definitely', 'better', 'teen', 'movie', 'past', 'few', 'months', 'have', 'seen', 'Takes', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'classic', 'element', 'American', 'Pie', 'truly', 'grasped']",Road Trip

Josh goes to Ithaca college in New York while his lifetime girlfriend, Tiffany, heads off to Austin, Texas to study vet. science. Of course, Josh succumbs to the temptations of the super-sexy Beth, who suggests they tape their romping on the covers (ya, that's Hollywood for you). The tape accidentally gets mailed to Tiffany and Josh and co. have three days to get to Austin to intercept the tape. As if Josh didn't have enough problems, he has to write an exam (and get a B+ or better) to stay in college. The result is a riotous road trip which culminates in a surprise ending.The story in narrated by the demented 8-year resident of Ithaca, Barry (Tom Green), who uses the story as a last-ditch effort to rope potential Ithaca students into signing up at the school. We are treated to some of the less normal aspects of Barry's mentality (such as eating a mouse to entice his friend's snake to eat one).

It is yet another boorish lampoon of college life that relies on heavy doses of outrageousness, crassness and crudely sexual jokes to lure its audience.  It was successful in this regard, grossing (no pun intended) close to $70 million on a meager $15 million budget.  The film clearly targets MTV males and it knows its audience, offering plenty of gratuitous female nudity and chauvinistic aphorisms like, ""It's not cheating if you're not in the same area code.""  I really don't have a problem with nudity, but having half a dozen scenes that linger gapingly on topless women who don't contribute anything to the story is nothing more than tasteless voyeurism used to pump up the testosterone factor.The story itself is a flimsy and predictable excuse for a sitcom.  Writer/Director Todd Phillips throws so much outlandish foolishness at the audience that he can't help but get a laugh every few minutes.  In this regard, I have to give him credit for a job well done.  He manages the actors and the comedy bits well and keeps the pace up.The acting is probably the best part of the film.  Breckin Meyer is excellent as the tortured hero trying to beat the videotape of his indiscretion to his girlfriend's dorm room.  Meyer has a dry and deadpan wit that works well with all the inanity around him.  MTV veteran Tom Green is so far around the bend in this film that he can see his own derriere.  Green is a master of shock comedy and will do or say anything to get a reaction, including eating a live mouse.  My favorite newcomer was DJ Qualls who played Kyle, the bashful geek whose looks alone provide continual physical comedy.I usually enjoy lowbrow slapstick comedy but this was zanier than even I could handle.  I rated it a 6/10.  Add two points if you are in college and another two points if you are a male 25 or under.

The movie is about a guy named Josh, who has a girlfriend that he's known since he was five years old.

Josh, realizing that his relationship with Tiffany could be in jeopardy, travels from Ithaca, NY with three friends, to Austin, Texas to intercept the tape before she does. Along the way, they get into a series of hilarious disasters, like the car exploding after they jump a bridge; staying overnight in an all-black fraternity with scrawny, stuck-up Kyle being the hit of the party; killing a snake (Green takes care of that), midterms, stuff like that.

Scott), and a nerd (DJ Qualls) whose car they need for the trip, they start the journey from New York to Texas.

In addition to Porky's, Animal House, American Pie, Sixteen Candles, etc., this movie proves its worth in the long run.  Many may perhaps consider the plot lacking or immature.  Not true.  The plot is simplified, but what teen movie isn't?  The key to this movie's success is its subplots and intertwining timing.  The director provides the movie with great pacing and a wonderful sense of timing for scenes and jokes.  Tom Green's character is great for a change of pace and his scenes with the snake is NOT to slow the movie, but to provide the essential subplot.  Road Trip is so entertaining that there is no lost moment.  All the scenes are vital to the movement of the plot.  And there are enough scene changes and storyplot twists that keep the audience interested.  The director and screenwriter did a fantastic job. Why buy this movie?  This is a great movie to watch whenver you're bored.  The DVD version has nothing special, but I believe you are paying extra for the picture quality, not the added nudity scenes.  Plus, this movie was produced with 15 million and made over 70 million in the theatres.  That's pretty impressive considering the lack of star power, lack of advertising, and Zero overseas gross.  No special effects, no overuse of foul language and pretty much no expectations to do well whatsoever.  But it DID gross nearly quadruple it's investment.

His scenes with the mouse and the snake were grating, long-winded and utterly worthless to the plot of the film.  For the first time that I can recall, I actually read through the credits to see if Drew Barrymore (Green's fiancee) was an executive producer.  I figured that would be the only way he would be cast in a film.  Tom Green is a Pauly Shore wannabe (and that, my friends, is not saying much).Other than Tom Green, the other characters were fun to watch and the story was pretty good and oftentimes funny.  Seann William Scott again plays a character similar to his &quot;Stifler&quot; role in American Pie (the oversexed smart aleck), but he plays it very well.  DJ Quills, who plays the nerdy character who, reluctantly, lets his friends use his car and credit card is a big hit.

When Josh's sex tape is accidentally mailed to his near lifelong girlfriend Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard), Josh and his posse of dorm buddies (lech E.L., nerd Kyle and stoner Rubin) pack up for a Road Trip to intercept the tape before Tiffany receives it.THE ANALYSIS:The movie is full of humorous (and some quite disturbing) moments.  The clear star of the movie for me was Seann ""Stifler"" William Scott who portrayed Josh's best bud E.L. who single-handedly had THE BEST SCENE in the movie at the ""donor clinic.""  The humor value is right up there with most other movies in the ""teen comedy"" genre as of late, ...The main problem that I have with the movie though is actually the basic plot of the movie.  Call me old-fashioned but I find it disturbing that the movie is basically about a guy who cheats on his girlfriend and goes to ANY and ALL lengths (including using and abusing a ""friend"" to aid him, lying, stealing, etc.) to cover his tracks.  It further bothers me that he actually has friends willing to back him up on it.Equally disturbing was Tom Green's character and his maniacal obsession with killing mice.  Where's the humor/entertainment value in that???Aside from those two criticism's the movie was pretty funny and entertaining.  The many misadventures that the crew encounters as they travel from Ithaca, NY to Austin, Texas are pretty hilarious and should keep you laughing and amused....THE VERDICT:Again, the film was hilarious and entertaining ..., but still the overall plot and Tom Green's character may leave you with a bit of a bad taste...(Mildly) Recommended",3,"Funny, BUT&#65533;",1025827200,"07 5, 2002",2002,1928,"['Road', 'Trip', 'having', 'quite', 'handful', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'being', 'entertaining', 'leaves', 'bit', 'lukewarm', 'mainly', 'basic', 'premise', 'movie', 'THE', 'STORY', 'Josh', 'Breckin', 'Meyer', 'temptation', 'one-night', 'stand', 'lovely', 'classmate', 'who', 'had', 'hots', 'Beth', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'encounter', 'taped', 'When', 'Josh', 'sex', 'tape', 'accidentally', 'mailed', 'lifelong', 'girlfriend', 'Tiffany', 'Rachel', 'Blanchard', 'Josh', 'posse', 'dorm', 'buddies', 'lech', 'E.L.', 'nerd', 'Kyle', 'stoner', 'Rubin', 'pack', 'up', 'Road', 'Trip', 'intercept', 'tape', 'Tiffany', 'it.THE', 'ANALYSIS', 'movie', 'full', 'humorous', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'moments', 'clear', 'star', 'movie', 'was', 'Seann', 'Stifler', 'William', 'Scott', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Josh', 'best', 'bud', 'E.L.', 'who', 'single-handedly', 'had', 'THE', 'BEST', 'SCENE', 'movie', 'donor', 'clinic', 'humor', 'value', 'right', 'there', 'most', 'other', 'movies', 'teen', 'comedy', 'genre', 'late', 'main', 'problem', 'have', 'movie', 'though', 'actually', 'basic', 'plot', 'movie', 'Call', 'old-fashioned', 'find', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'basically', 'guy', 'who', 'girlfriend', 'ANY', 'ALL', 'lengths', 'including', 'using', 'abusing', 'friend', 'aid', 'lying', 'stealing', 'etc', 'cover', 'tracks', 'further', 'bothers', 'actually', 'friends', 'willing', 'back', 'up', 'it.Equally', 'disturbing', 'was', 'Tom', 'Green', 'character', 'maniacal', 'obsession', 'killing', 'mice', 'Where', 'humor/entertainment', 'value', 'Aside', 'two', 'criticism', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'many', 'misadventures', 'crew', 'encounters', 'travel', 'Ithaca', 'NY', 'Austin', 'Texas', 'are', 'pretty', 'hilarious', 'should', 'keep', 'laughing', 'amused', '.THE', 'VERDICT', 'Again', 'film', 'was', 'hilarious', 'entertaining', 'still', 'overall', 'plot', 'Tom', 'Green', 'character', 'may', 'leave', 'bit', 'bad', 'taste', 'Mildly', 'Recommended']",Road Trip

526848,AJ4TG9LNSB0Y4,B00003CXIY,"Robert M. ""Professional Nerd""","[0, 0]","I just took a look at Road Trip, comedy from way back in 2000. I bought it because it came with a free ticket to see The Hangover Part III and I had a passing interest in seeing it. I am now starting to regret that decision, twofold.The plot is fairly straightforward, with no real surprises in terms of the narrative, but the premise offers plenty of opportunities for funny scenes and characters. Road Trip, unfortunately, misses most of those opportunities. This film was clearly meant to be in the same vein as American Pie, a raunchy college comedy, but it doesn't quite reach that level, nor that of something like Animal House.Like I said, the plot isn't too complicated. College slacker Josh Parker (Breckin Meyer) has a girlfriend named Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard), his childhood sweetheart, but they attend different colleges, with Josh at the fictional University of Ithaca in New York State and Tiffany at the University of Austin, Texas. He has a tryst with classmate Beth (Amy Smart), which she lets him videotape. Said tape is accidentally mailed to Tiffany as part of Josh's ritual of him sending her video journals, or something like that. Now Josh and his buddies have three days to drive from New York to Texas to intercept the tape before Tiffany sees it. It's pretty straightforward, no real problems plot or narrative wise, with one glaring exception. The plot is set in a frame story, a set of flashbacks narrated by Tom Green's character, which I'll go into detail with later. This framing device is pointless. If taken out, there is no loss to the plot. In fact, he could've just as easily been narrated by Meyer's character.During this trip, there are a decent variety of scenes and environments given the road path that the friends take. The cinematography is decent, but nothing special. The soundtrack is typical of the late 1990s early 2000s era, mostly mellow college rock; again, nothing to write home about. The shenanigans that the characters get into, typical of this ""crazy adventure"" type story, are hit and miss, mostly miss. Thankfully though, a lot of the unfunny jokes don't last very long, and are typically scene-enders. The gross-out type comedy that is prevalent in this genre is kept to a minimum without any real loss of the comedy, or this case, lack thereof. The fan-service scenes are gratuitous, of course, but that's the point in this genre; they serve their purpose. The dialogue between the characters is a natural and believable, given the characters and the situations that they find themselves in; most of it isn't pointless, but there are some hiccups.The acting and the characters are really were this film drops the ball. It's hard to remember, but these actors seem a little bit too old for college kids, even for back then, but for suspension-of-disbelief's sake, I'm willing to forgive that. First of all, not everything is bad. Amy Smart is nice and likable, the girl-next-door type. She does okay, with a good and believable mix of strength and vulnerability. DJ Qualls as Kyle is squirrelly and vulnerable, but not wholly feeble. His friends do take advantage of him, but it all does seem to be in good fun, and he takes it in stride well enough. He is the ""pathetic loser"" type typical of teen films, not unlike Cameron from Ferris Bueller's Day Off (played by Alan Ruck), right down to the overly strict father. Unlike Cameron, Kyle does eventually confront his father directly, rather than it being implied, and although this particular plotline's resolution is not terrible, it's not particularly satisfying either. Breckin Meyer is barely passable. He almost delves into blandness, but not quite enough to destroy the performance, but he does straddle that line a little too closely for my taste. Paulo Costanzo as Rubin is boring, emotionless, and uninteresting; if he obviously doesn't care about what's going on around him, why should we? He's the stoner/slacker stereotype, and he doesn't diverge from that trope at all, and much of the plot can take place without him without any real loss. Sean William Scott plays . . . somebody. I forget the actual character name, but let's face it, he's just playing Stifler from the American Pie films again. Seriously, the character is no different, essentially a copy-and-paste with no discernible changes whatsoever. But I suppose that is the point, as Sean William Scott was typecast for that character type. If you found Stiffler funny, you'll find Stifler 2.0 funny in this film too. Anthony Rapp's character of Jacob is a stock psycho/stalker type; he's clich&eacute;d and lame, and only serves to poorly fill the ""bully"" stereotype, but he doesn't really look the part. There are some funny cameos, however. Horatio Sanz, from Saturday Night Live fame, has one of the few really funny parts in this film. It's of the gross-out variety, but not too bad and hilarious nonetheless. Jimmy Kimmel also has a cameo that's pretty funny; see if you can catch it. There's also a brief appearance by John Ross Bowie, whom you probably know as Barry Kripke of The Big Bang Theory fame. Of course, Andy Dick is an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise good cameo list. But all of this, good and bad, is nothing compared to the true horror of this film, the un-equally terrible Tom Green.Tom Green is abysmal in this film; by far, he is the worst thing about it. He is annoying and unfunny. For the life of me, I cannot remember or understand why we as a nation ever found him funny, and frankly, I'm ashamed of it. Like I said before, he's the narrator for the frame story, but I already went over how pointless that was. In fact every scene he's in is pointless and goes nowhere. Not one bit of it is funny, just annoying and obnoxious. Everything about this character is painful. His name is Barry Manilow, something that I believe that the real Barry Manilow regrets immensely. Tom Green's scenes are painful in every sense of the word to watch. The only good one is where the snake tries to eat him, and man, do I wish it did, but then again, Tom Green is nearly impossible to stomach.The ending, which I won't give away here, is kind of anti-climactic, in the sense that it just sort of happens without any real tension or build-up. I will give the film credit for this though: the way the situation resolves is unconventional and unexpected, and even grown-up in its own way. The standard epilogue for this type of film, that being the ""what happened to them afterward"" footnotes are uninteresting for all the characters, and don't do any of them any real justice, what little there was to be done.The DVD extras are standard, mostly trailers. The trailer itself is mostly more Tom Green, so it's just annoying. He also hosts the making-of documentary, so that's also worthless. The deleted scenes were left out for reason, as they are even less funny than what made it into the film, and many of them are just mean-spirited. Skipping the DVD extras will most likely do you more good than otherwise.Overall, this film is boring, forgettable, and only slightly funny in some rare parts. That being said, it's not outright terrible, but it comes darn close, almost too close for comfort. There could've been some genuine comedy here, but the opportunity is mostly missed out on. Unless you're really a fan of just this genre of raunchy college comedy films, you're better off passing on it.",2,Don't make a pit stop for this film.

You may laugh a lot, depending on state of mind or intelligence, but one thing is clear: none of the cast is going to get noticed to have a bigger chance, like Jason Biggs or Chris Klein from ""American Pie,"" because the film itself is like junk food or chewing gum.  It is easily digested and disposed.  Buy it, taste it, enjoy its flavor, and throw it away.  And as for Tom  Green, I have nothing to say except that his weird mannerism is getting unfunny.If you wanna see lots of nudity including that of Amy Smart, go for it.  And you can see Tom Green lick a live mouse in his mouth.  But within ten minutes after watching it, you will forget anything about ""Road Trip"" except for those two scenes. And within five years, you'll forget everyting about the film and the cast.",2,"Don't Expect ""American Pie"" from This Mean-Spirited Film",1013472000,"02 12, 2002",2002,1446,"['Do', ""n't"", 'compare', 'so-so', 'comedy', 'American', 'Pie', 'incidentally', 'included', 'unmemorable', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'gross-out', 'gags', 'American', 'Pie', 'good-natured', 'film', 'value', 'based', 'very', 'classic', 'even', 'conservative', 'outlook', 'life', 'Road', 'Trip', 'not', 'B-list', 'actor', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'hilarious', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'well-intentioned', 'advice', 'caused', 'great', 'laughter', 'American', 'Pie', 'surprise', 'Road', 'Trip', 'rude', 'crude', 'mean', 'made', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'such', 'words', 'love', 'friendship', 'may', 'laugh', 'resent', 'seeing', 'four', 'stupid', 'college', 'students', 'doing', 'politically', 'uncorrect', 'things', 'intentional', 'may', 'laugh', 'lot', 'depending', 'state', 'mind', 'intelligence', 'one', 'thing', 'clear', 'none', 'cast', 'going', 'get', 'noticed', 'have', 'bigger', 'chance', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'American', 'Pie', 'film', 'junk', 'food', 'chewing', 'gum', 'easily', 'digested', 'disposed', 'Buy', 'taste', 'enjoy', 'flavor', 'throw', 'away', 'Tom', 'Green', 'have', 'nothing', 'say', 'weird', 'mannerism', 'getting', 'unfunny.If', 'wan', 'see', 'lots', 'nudity', 'including', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'go', 'can', 'see', 'Tom', 'Green', 'live', 'mouse', 'mouth', 'ten', 'minutes', 'watching', 'will', 'forget', 'anything', 'Road', 'Trip', 'two', 'scenes', 'five', 'years', ""'ll"", 'forget', 'everyting', 'film', 'cast']",Road Trip

526866,ACVLLA37BN9KY,B00003CXIY,Valjean,"[2, 5]","The plot of this story is revolves around a college student, Josh Parker(Meyer) who recruits a group of dorm buddies to help him get from New York to Texas in order to intercept a mistakenly mailed video tape of himself having sex with another girl, before it falls into the hands of his girlfriend.  On paper, it looks like a winner and I expected to see something like a cross between Vacation and Van Wilder.  However, while you might expect this kind of movie to be loaded with side-splitting high jinks, I found the humor highly predictable and the characters flat at best.There are 3 main characters besides Parker and they are all pretty cliche.  First there is E.L. (Scott), as the obnoxious instigator.  There is Rubin Carver (Costanzo), as the eccentric pot-smoking A-student.  Of course, there is also the pathetic 98-pound straw man virgin Kyle Edwards (Qualls), who is the butt of everyone's jokes.  As the plot progresses: the pathetic virgin is deflowered; Carver smokes pot with an old man, and E.L. steals a short-bus and discovers the joys of prostate stimulation.  Like I said, it sounds good on paper, but every gag is telegraphed from a mile away.On the upside, while the humor is flat, the plot is kind of engaging.  The main reason that you will keep watching this movie is to find out whather or not Josh gets to Texas in time to intercept the videotape.  You will appreciate the consistency and linearity of the storyline, which is not diluted by the inclusion of too many subplots.  It really is a good road movie, if not a good comedy.On the downside (except for Scott and Smart) the actors in this flick have about as much screen presence as a rock.  While the characters might have been written as one-dimensional stereotypes, at least they could have played thier roles with some enthusiasm.Still, Road Trip is a fairly engaging movie but only because of the main plot.  As a comedy, however, it is pretty flat.",2,"Flat and Predictable, but Tolerable",1091318400,"08 1, 2004",2004,1941,"['plot', 'story', 'college', 'student', 'Josh', 'Parker', 'Meyer', 'who', 'group', 'dorm', 'buddies', 'help', 'get', 'New', 'York', 'Texas', 'order', 'intercept', 'mistakenly', 'mailed', 'video', 'tape', 'having', 'sex', 'girl', 'hands', 'girlfriend', 'paper', 'winner', 'expected', 'see', 'something', 'cross', 'Vacation', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'However', 'might', 'expect', 'kind', 'movie', 'be', 'loaded', 'side-splitting', 'high', 'jinks', 'found', 'humor', 'highly', 'predictable', 'characters', 'flat', 'are', '3', 'main', 'characters', 'Parker', 'are', 'pretty', 'cliche', 'First', 'E.L.', 'Scott', 'obnoxious', 'instigator', 'Rubin', 'Carver', 'Costanzo', 'eccentric', 'pot-smoking', 'A-student', 'course', 'also', 'pathetic', '98-pound', 'straw', 'man', 'virgin', 'Kyle', 'Edwards', 'Qualls', 'who', 'butt', 'everyone', 'jokes', 'plot', 'pathetic', 'virgin', 'deflowered', 'Carver', 'pot', 'old', 'man', 'E.L.', 'short-bus', 'joys', 'prostate', 'stimulation', 'said', 'good', 'paper', 'gag', 'telegraphed', 'mile', 'upside', 'humor', 'flat', 'plot', 'kind', 'engaging', 'main', 'reason', 'will', 'keep', 'watching', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'whather', 'not', 'Josh', 'Texas', 'time', 'intercept', 'videotape', 'will', 'appreciate', 'consistency', 'linearity', 'storyline', 'not', 'diluted', 'inclusion', 'too', 'many', 'subplots', 'really', 'good', 'road', 'movie', 'not', 'good', 'comedy.On', 'downside', 'Scott', 'Smart', 'actors', 'flick', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'screen', 'presence', 'rock', 'characters', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'one-dimensional', 'stereotypes', 'least', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'thier', 'roles', 'enthusiasm.Still', 'Road', 'Trip', 'fairly', 'engaging', 'movie', 'only', 'main', 'plot', 'comedy', 'however', 'pretty', 'flat']",Road Trip

526869,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00003CXIY,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","""Road Trip"" (2000) is a school comedy and road trip movie about a likable college guy who wants to stay faithful to his long-time girlfriend. Unfortunately he gives-in to temptation and accidentally sends her a video of him making out with another girl. He and a group of friends rush from Ithaca, NY, to Austin, TX, to recover the evidence before his girlfriend receives it.I initially saw ""Road Trip"" on TV while on vacation a few years ago and liked it enough to purchase the film recently. Viewing the uncut version, I was turned off by the crude humor (in the manner of, say, ""American Pie""), but have to admit that I busted out laughing numerous times, plus the characters are really fleshed out, like the protagonist (Breckin Meyer) who really does want to stay true to his long-distant girlfriend; the ""I'm only in college for sex"" dude who you can't help but like for some reason (Seann William Scott); the geek whom the 'cool' dudes befriend for selfish purposes (DJ Qualls) and more.Amy Smart also co-stars as the protagonist's new girlfriend.FINAL WORD: The only thing that prevents ""Road Trip"" from achieving A-grade status like, say, ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" is the unnecessary crude parts. If you can look past this flaw, it's consistently funny and has great characters. The women aren't all that great, although Amy Smart is solid.The film runs 95 minutes and was shot mostly in Georgia & Tennessee, but also includes an aerial shot of Harvard (Massachusetts), as well as footage from USC and the University of Texas in Austin.GRADE: B",4,"Too crude, but good characters and really funny",1376524800,"08 15, 2013",2013,1558,"['Road', 'Trip', '2000', 'school', 'comedy', 'road', 'trip', 'movie', 'likable', 'college', 'guy', 'who', 'stay', 'faithful', 'long-time', 'girlfriend', 'Unfortunately', 'gives-in', 'temptation', 'accidentally', 'video', 'making', 'out', 'girl', 'group', 'friends', 'rush', 'Ithaca', 'NY', 'Austin', 'TX', 'recover', 'evidence', 'girlfriend', 'it.I', 'initially', 'saw', 'Road', 'Trip', 'TV', 'vacation', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'liked', 'enough', 'purchase', 'film', 'recently', 'Viewing', 'uncut', 'version', 'was', 'turned', 'off', 'crude', 'humor', 'manner', 'say', 'American', 'Pie', 'have', 'admit', 'busted', 'out', 'laughing', 'numerous', 'times', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'fleshed', 'out', 'protagonist', 'Breckin', 'Meyer', 'who', 'really', 'want', 'stay', 'true', 'long-distant', 'girlfriend', ""'m"", 'only', 'college', 'sex', 'dude', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'like', 'reason', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'geek', 'whom', ""'cool"", 'dudes', 'befriend', 'selfish', 'purposes', 'DJ', 'Qualls', 'Smart', 'also', 'protagonist', 'new', 'girlfriend.FINAL', 'WORD', 'only', 'thing', 'Road', 'Trip', 'achieving', 'A-grade', 'status', 'say', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'unnecessary', 'crude', 'parts', 'can', 'look', 'flaw', 'consistently', 'funny', 'great', 'characters', 'women', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'great', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'solid.The', 'film', '95', 'minutes', 'was', 'shot', 'mostly', 'Georgia', 'Tennessee', 'also', 'aerial', 'shot', 'Harvard', 'Massachusetts', 'as', 'well', 'footage', 'USC', 'University', 'Texas', 'Austin.GRADE', 'B']",Road Trip
