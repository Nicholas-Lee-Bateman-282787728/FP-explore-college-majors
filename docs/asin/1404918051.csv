168335,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,1404918051,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 11]","Jennifer Garner, of Alias and Daredevil fame, takes charge of this cliched family comedy about a geeky teenager named Jenna Rink that is unsatisfied with her life.  She is tired of the jokes and the unpopularity, and desires to be ""thirty, flirty, and thriving"".  Her dream is about to come true.  Due to a incident with her friend Matt and some biological ""wishing dust"", Jenna is transformed to her life 17 years later.  Unfortunately, it isn't what she dreamed it would be.  She has lost touch with her friends, family, and is an untrustworthy person in the office.  She loves to drink, cheat, and lie.  This is not the life she imagined.  Now Jenna has the chance to make it all change and to live the life that she has always dreamed about.  Will she have the time to change everything or will life's little consequences keep her from changing her future?This film failed on many levels.  Not only were we forced to watch an actress that couldn't quite nail her part, but we also had to listen to her attempt a high-pitched voice throughout the whole hour and a half.  We are left with themes left unexplored and a mismatched message sent to our viewers.  Jenna, before her change into a teenager, was a very sinister woman.  What happened to this woman?  Did she just suddenly disappear when ""teenage"" Jenna awoke?  I needed more answers to this question, yet none were provided.  Secondly, I was not impressed with the message that was made during this film.  What I witnessed was a woman that could not handle the stress of ""real life"", so she attempts to find an alternate route using ""magic dust"".  This is pathetic.  I realize that a message needed to be created, but it should not have been this far based from reality.  There were no connections made to any of the characters, the emotion was drab, and the acting was well below expectations to say the least.  The only redeeming factor in this film is Mark Ruffalo who gives the best performance by just wandering through this open void known as 13 Going on 30.Overall, I say skip it.  Hollywood has been producing these carbon copy films for years and unless we begin ""skipping"" them soon, we will be forced to watch them again and again and again.Grade:  *  out of ****",2,Can you tell I'm wearing underwear?,1094515200,"09 7, 2004",2004,2235,"['Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Alias', 'Daredevil', 'fame', 'charge', 'cliched', 'family', 'comedy', 'geeky', 'teenager', 'named', 'Jenna', 'Rink', 'unsatisfied', 'life', 'tired', 'jokes', 'unpopularity', 'desires', 'be', 'thirty', 'flirty', 'thriving', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'Due', 'incident', 'friend', 'Matt', 'biological', 'wishing', 'dust', 'Jenna', 'transformed', 'life', '17', 'years', 'later', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'what', 'dreamed', 'would', 'be', 'lost', 'touch', 'friends', 'family', 'untrustworthy', 'person', 'office', 'drink', 'cheat', 'lie', 'not', 'life', 'imagined', 'Now', 'Jenna', 'chance', 'make', 'change', 'live', 'life', 'always', 'dreamed', 'Will', 'have', 'time', 'change', 'everything', 'will', 'life', 'little', 'consequences', 'keep', 'changing', 'future', 'film', 'failed', 'many', 'levels', 'Not', 'only', 'were', 'forced', 'watch', 'actress', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'nail', 'part', 'also', 'had', 'listen', 'attempt', 'high-pitched', 'voice', 'whole', 'hour', 'half', 'are', 'left', 'themes', 'left', 'unexplored', 'mismatched', 'message', 'sent', 'viewers', 'Jenna', 'change', 'teenager', 'was', 'very', 'sinister', 'woman', 'What', 'happened', 'woman', 'Did', 'just', 'suddenly', 'disappear', 'when', 'teenage', 'Jenna', 'awoke', 'needed', 'more', 'answers', 'question', 'yet', 'none', 'were', 'provided', 'Secondly', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'message', 'was', 'made', 'film', 'What', 'witnessed', 'was', 'woman', 'could', 'not', 'handle', 'stress', 'real', 'life', 'find', 'alternate', 'route', 'using', 'magic', 'dust', 'pathetic', 'realize', 'message', 'needed', 'be', 'created', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'based', 'reality', 'were', 'connections', 'made', 'characters', 'emotion', 'was', 'drab', 'acting', 'was', 'well', 'expectations', 'say', 'least', 'only', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'film', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'who', 'best', 'performance', 'just', 'wandering', 'open', 'void', 'known', '13', 'Going', '30.Overall', 'say', 'skip', 'Hollywood', 'been', 'producing', 'carbon', 'copy', 'films', 'years', 'begin', 'skipping', 'soon', 'will', 'be', 'forced', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'again.Grade', '*', '****']",N/A

168338,AUW8TCRK9EDQ6,1404918051,Andre LeBlanc,"[4, 4]","There is definitely a strong parallel between this movie and the Tom Hanks classic, Big.  Jennifer Garner plays a 13 year old unpopular girl who desperately wishes to be a sophisticated adult woman.  She gets her wish, only to find out that her life is essentially meaningless.  She is popular and successful but is not a very nice person, and many of her so called friendships are rather superficial.  She falls in love with her childhood friend Matt, who she was cruel to, only to find out he is engaged to somebody else.  Garner's character then wishes to return to childhood to embrace this friend, even though he was ""nerdy"" and unpopular.13 Going on 30 is very predictable.  However, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Garner is very charming in this movie, and the film is every bit as fun and entertaining as I hoped it would be.  However, it also has a lot of meaning.  It really makes a person appreciate the people who are important in your life.  I don't have any children, but I would definitely recommend this film for parents to watch with their children.  It could have a significantly positive impact on their social interactions in junior high and high school.  Hopefully, it will make them realize that being popular and hanging out with popular kids is rather meaningless in the long term.

Of course, what makes Garner so great here is a top-notch supporting cast including the always excellent Mark Ruffalo (who refuses to let the movie drop its high goals and standards), top-notch comedic talent Judy Greer as 'best friend' (verifiably so) Lucy ('Tom-Tom') Wyman, and a completely un-Gollum-esque Andy Serkis as magazine head Richard Kneeland.Still though, Garner herself displays wonderful comedic timing and phrasing.

168343,A3C37W8WGMV8UQ,1404918051,Angela Dalecki,"[5, 9]","Jenna Rink is a 13-year old who isn't really enjoying adolescent life. (But then, who does?) She's unpopular, a bit of a dork, and only has one real friend: her next-door neighbor, Matt. After an embarrassing incident at her thirteenth birthday party, Jenna frantically wishes to be grown-up and successful.The next morning, Jenna wakes up to find her wish has come true-she's magically transformed into her adult self. After the initial panic, she realizes that she's living the life she's always wanted-she's gorgeous, popular, an editor at a big fashion magazine, and she's dating a hockey player from the New York Rangers. Of course, she has no memory of how she got to this point in her life. As she tries to discover who she is by going through old yearbooks and talking with people, she learns that she doesn't like the person she's become. It turns out that 30-year-old Jenna is selfish, conniving, and manipulative. She's no longer friends with her childhood friend, Matt, she doesn't speak to her parents, and she's heartless when dealing with people in her career. Jenna soon realizes that her wish may be permanent and goes about trying to make things right.The concept of the film is cute enough, but the execution is a little shaky. Many times throughout the film, new information is introduced, but then the movie doesn't do anything with that information or explain why things are a certain way (for example, Jenna learns early on that she's not in contact with her parents, but it's never clear exactly what happened to cause that). Also, it's very obvious that the movie is based on ""Big."" I expected that. What I didn't expect were direct rip-offs of the Tom Hanks film. This movie took some of its gags directly from its predecessor-from checking out new ""adult"" body parts, to standing up in a limousine, to not knowing what to do with hors d'ourves at a company cocktail party. And these jokes didn't work as well this time around. With the exception of a very funny scene involving a cell phone and a few other gems, the movie had very few original gags-which is a shame, because the movie could have been great if they'd come up with some more original material. Another problem: because of its close relationship to ""Big,"" this film is almost excruciatingly predictable.The movie isn't very long-about 90 minutes or so-but the pacing seemed off to me. The first hour or so moved almost too quickly, and then the last half hour really seemed to drag.

Though there is no magic ""powder"" that will spread over our head and gets you to become 30 overnight.  However, the magic powder does allow us to see how fast, and unconscious we change from a pure, nice, wonderful person to a mean, manipulative individual who back stabs others and who is superficial.  Everyone has the capacity to turn around and become a nasty individual who is self-absorbed and self-centered.  I like the way the story goes when she become aware of all her hurtful behavior towards self and others at the age of 30 and wanted to correct the mistakes she made.  I believe such individual exists in real life.  Everyone who is willing to learn from the mistakes made in life has the capacity to turn around and become a wonderful person.  However, it does take courage for us to look into what we have done towards self and others in order to grow.  Though there is no ""magic powder"" in life that turns us to 13 and start life all over again, I believe one would find love and peace within self and others if they are willing to let go of their manipulative, back-stabbing, superficial behavior.I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone to watch though I would say it is surly a move catering towards women.

Ryan ""Merribelle""","[2, 4]","This is the chick flick that I will have no reservations recommending to other ""chicks"" of my generation (ahem, those of us who can remember dancing to Rick Springfield and ""Thriller"").  No doubt some will complain that it's too derivative of an earlier kid-grows-up-suddenly film, others will grouse about the simple plot and lack of smut (as if that's a necessary ingredient to enjoy a film, hmmmm).  I say just enjoy the trip down memory lane to what it was like when we were thirteen, idealistic and joyful for all the right reasons.Garner plays the fabulously chic Jenna Rink, editor of a major fashion magazine in NYC who apparently woke up one morning with amnesia for the past 17 years of her life (actually, it's a bit more complicated than that, involving some kind of mystical wish fulfillment of her geeky 13-year-old self to be ""Thirty and Flirty"", but anyway...).  From her point of view, she was thirteen one minute, and the next minute she's woken up one morning to find herself thirty years old and possessing everything she had always thought she wanted; a cool job, a fashionable wardrobe, a gorgeous body and a designer wardrobe that Carrie Bradshaw would kill for.  After she gets reoriented, she starts to enjoy herself, but only for a while because she is starting to find out things about her grownup self that aren't at all nice.  For one thing, she has cut her family out of her life to climb the corporate ladder, and for another, she has managed to alienate her only real friend in life, Matt - former boy-next-door/pal who had a secret crush on her.  This new life is shallow, mean-spritied and empty.  How can she ""fix"" it now that she has thrown away everything that she used to hold dear?I have an immense new respect for Jennifer Garner.  In this film 13 Going on 30 she proved to me that she is not just another beautiful starlet cashing in on her look of the moment, but a real actress who can rise to the challenge of comedy.  It mustn't be easy to play a 13 year old in a 30 year old's body, but Garner pulled it off fabulously.  She was totally convincing as a kid who just wanted to have fun and make friends with the jaded, stuffy adults in her new world.  Yes, the plot is something like another film starring Tom Hanks, but the sheer girliness and `80s nostalgia of Jenna's situation was a unique take on the story that had me involved completely.  Garner somehow has that magical ability to be funny and vulnerable even while she's drop dead gorgeous (note, IMHO most drop dead gorgeous actresses rely on their looks more than good acting, so this is a high compliment coming from me).  Okay, I'm sure the writing had something to do with it, too.Leave the guys to their guy stuff (unless your guy happens to think Jennifer Garner is hot!) and round up your girlfriends to see 13 Going on 30.-Andrea, aka Merribelle",5,Jennifer had me totally convinced -- top notch and fun!,1083715200,"05 5, 2004",2004,2858,"['chick', 'flick', 'will', 'have', 'reservations', 'recommending', 'other', 'chicks', 'generation', 'ahem', 'who', 'can', 'remember', 'dancing', 'Rick', 'Springfield', 'Thriller', 'No', 'doubt', 'will', 'complain', 'too', 'derivative', 'earlier', 'kid-grows-up-suddenly', 'film', 'others', 'will', 'grouse', 'simple', 'plot', 'lack', 'smut', 'necessary', 'ingredient', 'enjoy', 'film', 'hmmmm', 'say', 'just', 'enjoy', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'what', 'was', 'when', 'were', 'thirteen', 'idealistic', 'joyful', 'right', 'reasons.Garner', 'fabulously', 'chic', 'Jenna', 'Rink', 'editor', 'major', 'fashion', 'magazine', 'NYC', 'who', 'apparently', 'woke', 'up', 'one', 'morning', 'amnesia', 'past', '17', 'years', 'life', 'actually', 'bit', 'more', 'complicated', 'involving', 'kind', 'mystical', 'wish', 'fulfillment', 'geeky', '13-year-old', 'self', 'be', 'Thirty', 'Flirty', 'anyway', 'point', 'view', 'was', 'thirteen', 'one', 'minute', 'next', 'minute', 'woken', 'up', 'one', 'morning', 'find', 'thirty', 'years', 'old', 'possessing', 'everything', 'had', 'always', 'thought', 'wanted', 'cool', 'job', 'fashionable', 'wardrobe', 'gorgeous', 'body', 'designer', 'wardrobe', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'would', 'kill', 'reoriented', 'enjoy', 'only', 'while', 'starting', 'find', 'out', 'things', 'grownup', 'self', 'are', ""n't"", 'nice', 'one', 'thing', 'cut', 'family', 'life', 'climb', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'managed', 'alienate', 'only', 'real', 'friend', 'life', 'Matt', 'former', 'boy-next-door/pal', 'who', 'had', 'secret', 'crush', 'new', 'life', 'shallow', 'mean-spritied', 'empty', 'How', 'can', 'fix', 'now', 'thrown', 'away', 'everything', 'used', 'hold', 'dear', 'have', 'immense', 'new', 'respect', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'film', '13', 'Going', '30', 'proved', 'not', 'just', 'beautiful', 'starlet', 'cashing', 'look', 'moment', 'real', 'actress', 'who', 'can', 'rise', 'challenge', 'comedy', 'must', ""n't"", 'be', 'easy', 'play', '13', 'year', 'old', '30', 'year', 'old', 'body', 'Garner', 'pulled', 'off', 'fabulously', 'was', 'totally', 'convincing', 'kid', 'who', 'just', 'wanted', 'have', 'fun', 'make', 'friends', 'jaded', 'stuffy', 'adults', 'new', 'world', 'Yes', 'plot', 'something', 'film', 'starring', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'sheer', 'girliness', '80s', 'nostalgia', 'Jenna', 'situation', 'was', 'unique', 'take', 'story', 'had', 'involved', 'completely', 'Garner', 'somehow', 'magical', 'ability', 'be', 'funny', 'vulnerable', 'even', 'drop', 'dead', 'gorgeous', 'note', 'IMHO', 'most', 'drop', 'dead', 'gorgeous', 'actresses', 'rely', 'looks', 'more', 'good', 'acting', 'high', 'compliment', 'coming', 'Okay', ""'m"", 'sure', 'writing', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'too.Leave', 'guys', 'guy', 'stuff', 'guy', 'think', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'hot', 'round', 'up', 'girlfriends', 'see', '13', 'Going', '30.-Andrea', 'aka', 'Merribelle']",N/A

It reminded me of how well Jamie Lee Curtis pulled off playing a sixteen year old in ""Freaky Friday."" Garner is just as fantastic, if not better.

It takes a great movie, or uncontrolable anticipation to get me to the 1 movie a year I average. That's mainly why I got the dish and all the premium movie channels. I tend to ramdomly give movies I'd never dream of watching otherwise at least a look. That's how I tripped over this flick, a retread formula for a plotline that, for better or worse, has an idenity of its own. It's not the best in it's genre, but it's a very sweet movie, and my first viewing of anything Jennifer Garner. So I had no ""Alias"" bias. She's not why I watched the movie. But she wound up to be the reason I watched it repeatedly. Garner plays an adorable role that I thought she was perfect for. And Judy Greer, whom I hadn't seen since the movie ""Jawbreaker,"" is her usual throw all you got into your role, as she plays Garner's ruthless, pompous friend and co-worker in their adulthood. I'd heard good and bad about Mark Ruffalo as well, but again, this was my first sampling of his work too, and I thought he was perfect for the role. It's a simple, sweet, romantic film that despite a couple variations plays out as expected. And there's also an obligatory archetypical character or two in the supporting cast, but fits in the context of the movie. I don't know what it is about me, but I love the ""Thriller"" scene. It's contrived, a little hokey (how many people of the age range in that scene actually know the ""Thriller"" dance, step by step?), but I love it, especially the subtle, blink and you'll miss it piece of that scene where Ruffalo's character tells Garner he's leaving the party, and the camera focusses close-up on their two hands drifting apart and the consequential, gasping look on Garner's face.

168354,AR37967IAR6ZT,1404918051,Benjamin,"[3, 5]","Expecting and getting a movie that's essentially a female remake of ""Big,"" I must say that ""13 Going On 30"" was still very entertaining when I saw it in a sneak preview.Though the performances from Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo were charming and sparkled with chemistry, the most entertaining aspects of the film came when it paid homage to '80s music. The ""Thriller"" dance sequence, part of which is shown in the trailer, is so elaborate that it alone becomes amusing. (Wondering how it would go over in real life, I tried to figure out whether I'd join in if someone else started a ""Thriller"" dance line. I figured I would.) There's a later scene involving Pat Benatar's ""Love Is a Battlefield"" that's also good, even though those songs are more 1984 than 1987 (the year featured in the flashback).The plot is completely predictable. It follows Jenna Rink, a 13-year-old girl in 1987, who so desperately wants to fit in with the cool crowd that she mocks the only friend who genuinely likes her, her next-door neighbor Matt.On her birthday, following some humiliation at the hands of Scrunchi-wearing, ponytailed popular girls, Jenna wishes she could just jump ahead in her life to age 30. And, thanks to some magical wishing dust, she does.Interestingly, in a departure from the ""Big"" plot that becomes its main point-of-interest, the movie's plot doesn't make her some suddenly-30-year-old who has to find out how to adjust to life in 1987. Instead, it just moves Jenna's mind at 13 into her 30-year-old self. So she gets to what her real life becomes, but with innocent eyes. And she finds that she doesn't really like who she becomes.Along the way, she learns what's right, falls in love and does other cutesy-romantic-comedy-fantasy stuff. But the movie works.

I also try to steer clear of ""chick flicks"" as often as possible.Imagine my surprise when watching ""13 Going on 30"", which is an absolutely irresistible feel good movie with great performances, a well written script, and some excellent direction.12 year old Jenna Rink (Christa B. Allen) just wants to be popular. I mean... what teenage girl doesn't?? However, she hasn't quite made her mark yet; but that is hopefully about to change. Her 13th birthday is coming up and she's invited the most popular click in school ""The Six Chicks"" to her party. Of course, none of the sought after Six Chicks (lead by snooty blonde Lucy: aka ""Tom Tom"") really want to go, until Jenna promises them that she will write their upcoming paper that is due in class. Jenna does have one lifelong friend in next door neighbor Matt (Sean Marquette), who harbors a secret crush on the young Jenna.The day of Jenna's 13th party has arrived, and the basement downstairs is all set up in innocent teenage party fashion. Matt arrives with a hand built dollhouse (complete with wishing dust) for Jenna. Then the ""Six Chicks"" show up, along with the most popular boys in school; and our Jenna is on Cloud 9... briefly.In typical childhood game fashion and at Tom Tom's suggestion, Jenna is blindfolded and lead to the closet, where she awaits a secret kiss from the boy at school she has a crush on.Well the whole thing goes terribly wrong, sending Jenna in a tailspin where she eventually wakes up 17 years later in her New York apartment.Hilarity and romance ensue for the remainder of the picture.Jenna soon realizes that she eventually became the leader of the ""Six Chicks"", that she still works with Tom Tom as an editor for her favorite fashion magazine. She also comes to find out that she essentially got everything she wanted as a young teenager. In the process, she learns that as an adult, she has turned into quite the ""BIT*H"", and has alienated everyone around her; including Matt for several years, her parents, and her fellow co-workers.It's all about rediscovering yourself as an adult with childlike eyes, as Jenna gradually finds out what she has become, and then does everything she can to change into the person she now feels she is inside. All the performances are great in this movie; from the young Jenna, Matt, and Tom Tom: to the now older versions of Jenna (Jennifer Gardner), Matt (Mark Ruffalo), and Tom Tom (Judy Greer).Jennifer Gardner is absolutely irresitable, charming, comedic and loveable as Jenna Rink. If your not a fan of hers, you more than likely will be after this movie.This is simply a great feel good movie, worthy of more than just one viewing.

168360,A1YB29BIDULEYE,1404918051,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[5, 5]","On the surface, this movie may seem like just another fluff movie. However, giving this movie its fair chance, we soon learn that it is anything but that. Basically, as the movie starts, we are introduced to the 13 year old Jenna Rink. She is unpopular and unhappy. More than anything, she wants to hook up with the 6 'cool girls' in the school. Her friend Matt tries to explain that to her that there really isn't much to admire or envy about the  '6 cool girls.' Matt seems like a nice of enough person, but Jenna doesn't have her eyes on him. Rather, she is after the popular Chris Grandy. After reading some teen magazines, she decides she wants to be '30, flirty, and thriving' just like the people in her magazines. Well, somehow, she gets her wish and 17 years fly by. Not only is she 30, but she has a high paying job that she wanted, and her best friend is (or was)Tom Tom  the leader of the 6 cool girls. She is understandably confused at first, but she soon becomes happy over her wish coming true. To some extent, she is still talking and acting like a 13 year old, but it does make sense. Well, soon the ""Bedazzled"" formula comes in. (If you saw that, you know as Frasier made his wishes, the devil or Elizabeth Hurley threw some unwanted element in.) Garner's movie is more profound. Jenna gradually realizes that even though she has gotten her wish, she doesn't like the person she has become. To be sure, she 'supposedly' did bad things in the missing 17 years she had no control over. But even in the time as a 30 year old she DID have control over, she gets notably shallow and self centered. Possibly, the most profound aspect of this film is that it exposes the hypocrisy of society. Remember, the magazines Jenna was reading as a 13 year old, filled her with the desires for the wish. And even after Jenna got the wishes that society filled her with, she was really unhappy with herself when she realized the kind of person she became. And the even worse price she may have to pay is Matt. Matt was never really popular, but he held to his important values even though they didn't make him popular. Jenna has lost his friendship; he has gotten engaged to another woman; while he to a generous extent finally forgives Jenna, Jenna realizes that they have become so different. Also, Jenna may have gotten the best friend she wanted. However, she eventually learns that being friends with 'whoever is cool' may not be real. They may be willing to drop you when they realize that your friendship is more dangerous or possibly less beneficial to them. One of the most powerful elements in this movie is that the company Jenna works for is in trouble, and the key to saving her place of employment may directly parallel what Jenna needed to resolve with herself. In all honesty, there isn't a dull moment. And you do walk away feeling like the time spent was enriching as well as entertaining.

It stars Jennifer Garner in the adult role as a person who was only thirteen years old just a few moments ago when she wished she was older and had her dream suddenly come true.The reason this film works, in spite of the less than original plot, is because of the directing and the performance by Garner and co- star Mark Ruffalo. Garner acts a little silly at times, but she still acts normal- meaning, the way you would expect a thirteen year- old to act if she was suddenly thirty years old. Her actions and her lines are often funny and sometimes serious and sweet, just like one would expect if something like this really happened. And Mark Ruffalo- Garner's onetime childhood buddy- shines as her present emotional and love interest. He is extremely laid back and likeable in his role.Director Gary Winick deserves the rest of the credit for making this movie work. He includes many old songs from the 1980s, like ""Love is a Battlefield"", ""Crazy for You"", ""Thriller"", and others and he times the words of the songs at just the right moment to deliver the right message for a scene. Also, he doesn't make the mistake of turning this into a stupid, slapstick comedy. There are plenty of serious moments and the comedy that does make its way to the final product is funny and memorable.This movie makes a fun choice for a date film. Those of the female persuasion will probably like it most of all, but it's really a good film for anyone to see.

Innocence, knowledge and having it all are the themes of this little gem of a movie starring Jennifer Garner (of Alias fame) and Mark Ruffalo.13 Going On 30 is a fairy tale romantic comedy that says we can have a do-over in our lives and learn from our mistakes just in time to have the lives we truly want, not the lives we thought we wanted when we were becoming who we are now.  You have to be a grown-up to fully appreciate this modern-day morality tale, because only hindsight is 20-20.Great retro hits from the 80s including Michael Jackson's Thriller video (a landmark moment in the lives of boomers and GenXers) and the Cyndi Lauper/Madonna look set the style of this movie as 13 year old Jenna Rink wakes up one day to find herself the 30-year-old editor of Poise Magazine.  Jenna discovers that she's not the person she wanted to be in spite of having everything she ever wanted.  Matt, her childhood best friend, is her guide in the present and her anchor from the past as Jenna sees who she's become, remembers who she was and tries to reconcile the two very different Jennas.This is a great little romantic comedy and a sure hit.

If they have moved one year forward it would have been OK if they were dancing ""Bad"" all over the film....The Go-Go's and Pat Benatar's ""Love is a Battlefield"" are from circa 1982 so I think Jenna and Matt didn't listen the latest hits but the oldies station or mom and dad old records. I don't blame them, back then I also liked to play Mother 60's records just for the fun of it...Belinda Carlisle's ""Mad About You"" and Witney Houston's ""I wanna dance with somebody"" are few of the actual Airplays from 1987 though.I'm aware that the songs they included in the soundtrack were chosen for commercial and nostalgia intentions only...Although young Jenna looks very 80's in her party (she even resembles ""Who's the Boss"" young Samantha played by Alyssa Milano) the ""popular girls"" don't reflect the real fashion of 1987: Girls like that are supposed to have tons of gel in the hair to make it look big, tall and punky.Many bracelets and necklaces Large shoulder pads in their rather 80's baggy T-shirts would have been the perfect accesories (ala 80's Married With Children's Kelly Bundy). Don't forget the thick eyebrows that were In!Young Matt looks like a kid time travel visitor from the 70's with that parted in one side long hair (ala Danny Partridge) and so does the other ""popular"" guys...It's funny to find these kind of distraction in movies trying to portray previous decades or ages specially if you actually were around...Cesar DominguezA Peruvian Youngman of HonorHomepage: [...]",4,The Fashion and Music of 1987 and '13 Going On 30' recreation.,1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,2109,"['Hola', 'Amigos', 'just', 'watched', '13', 'Going', '30', 'lazy', 'afternoon', 'first', 'day', '2006', 'HBO', 'Latin', 'America', 'here', 'Peru', 'really', 'enjoy', 'picture', 'have', 'quotations', 'Music', 'Fashion', '1987', 'recreation', '13', 'Going', '30', '.I', 'was', 'kid', '80', 'so', 'kind', 'remember', '1987', 'Walk', 'Egyptian', 'was', 'Top', 'Single', 'year', 'standing', 'several', 'weeks', 'Number', 'One', 'Billboard', 'Charts', 'so', 'young', 'Jenna', 'young', 'Matt', 'should', 'be', 'walking', 'egyptian', 'rather', 'Jackson', 'Thriller', '1982', 'Even', 'here', 'Latin', 'America', 'Thriller', 'was', 'already', 'old', 'news', 'out', 'dated', '1987', 'have', 'moved', 'one', 'year', 'forward', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'OK', 'were', 'dancing', 'Bad', 'film', 'Go-Go', 'Pat', 'Benatar', 'Love', 'Battlefield', 'are', 'circa', '1982', 'think', 'Jenna', 'Matt', 'did', ""n't"", 'listen', 'latest', 'hits', 'oldies', 'station', 'mom', 'dad', 'old', 'records', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'back', 'then', 'also', 'liked', 'play', 'Mother', '60', 'records', 'just', 'fun', 'Belinda', 'Carlisle', 'Mad', 'Witney', 'Houston', 'wan', 'na', 'dance', 'somebody', 'are', 'few', 'actual', 'Airplays', '1987', 'though.I', ""'m"", 'aware', 'songs', 'included', 'soundtrack', 'were', 'chosen', 'commercial', 'nostalgia', 'intentions', 'only', 'young', 'Jenna', 'very', '80', 'party', 'even', 'Who', 'Boss', 'young', 'Samantha', 'played', 'Alyssa', 'Milano', 'popular', 'girls', 'do', ""n't"", 'reflect', 'real', 'fashion', '1987', 'Girls', 'are', 'supposed', 'have', 'tons', 'gel', 'hair', 'make', 'look', 'big', 'tall', 'punky.Many', 'bracelets', 'necklaces', 'Large', 'shoulder', 'pads', 'rather', '80', 'baggy', 'T-shirts', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'accesories', '80', 'Married', 'Children', 'Kelly', 'Bundy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'thick', 'were', 'Young', 'Matt', 'kid', 'time', 'travel', 'visitor', '70', 'parted', 'one', 'side', 'long', 'hair', 'ala', 'Danny', 'Partridge', 'so', 'other', 'popular', 'guys', 'funny', 'find', 'kind', 'distraction', 'movies', 'trying', 'portray', 'previous', 'decades', 'ages', 'specially', 'actually', 'were', 'Cesar', 'DominguezA', 'Peruvian', 'Youngman', 'HonorHomepage', '[', ']']",N/A

Always yearning to be part of the popular crowd, Jenna makes an innocent wish to jump-start her growth and become one of the successful women that she reads about on the pages of Poise magazine.

This movie is the perfect vehicle for the actress because it allows her to break away from the action hero persona that she cultivated with the T.V. show Alias and Daredevil and prove that she can do a romantic comedy.Garner, with her warm, disarming smile has a wholesome, girl-next-door quality that is quite endearing. She's beautiful but not in an unattainable way. She also has natural comedic ability, for example, in one scene, Jenna livens up her magazine's boring party with an impromptu dance to Michael Jackson's ""Thriller,"" inspiring others to get up and dance as well. Garner also has a very expressive face that is perfect for the broad comedy of this movie. She is willing to take risks and make fun of herself. She is also willing to put herself out there and is not afraid to appear goofy and this only makes her that much more appealing.13 Going On 30 is the victim of the dreaded double dip. If you already own the Special Edition version of the movie, the two new extras hardly warrant a re-purchase. Also, if you already own the previous edition you might want to hold onto it as the audio commentary by director Gary Winick and the commentary by producers Gina Matthews, Donna Arkoff-Roth, and Susan Arnold is not on this edition.New to this edition is ""Fashion Flashback: Into the 1980s"" that features teen models gushing about how much they love the ""retro"" look of the `80s. It tells you what to look for and where to track down ""authentic"" clothes of that era.""Making of a Teen Dream"" takes us through the making of the movie in a fun, breezy way that is customary of most press kit type featurettes. The cast speak admiringly about each other in this self-congratulatory extra.There is a ""Bloopers"" reel, a collection of blown lines and other assorted goofs that are quite cute.Also included are two music videos, one for Pat Benatar's ""Love is a Battlefield"" and another for ""Jessie's Girl"" by Rick Springfield that allows you to immerse yourself in pure `80s cheese.The most enjoyable extra is ""I Was A Teenage Geek."" The cast talk about what they were like in the `80s. Everyone tells amusing stories of what they were doing in high school with photos of what they looked like at the time.There is also an ""Alternate Beginning and Ending"" that features different actors playing Jenna and Matt when they were kids. The scene is about the same length as what is in the movie but is edited differently. We get more detail on Jenna's desire to be one of the popular girls. Thankfully, these were not used.Finally, there are 15 deleted scenes with more footage of Jenna and Matt at the magazine party and so on. These scenes flesh out the relationships between the characters.",3,Stick with the Special Edition version!,1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,2912,"['unoriginal', 'premise', 'movie', 'Big', 'recast', 'woman', '13', 'Going', '30', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'star', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'who', 'role', 'loads', 'charm', 'movie', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'actress', 'break', 'away', 'action', 'hero', 'persona', 'cultivated', 'T.V', 'show', 'Alias', 'Daredevil', 'prove', 'can', 'do', 'romantic', 'comedy.Garner', 'warm', 'disarming', 'smile', 'wholesome', 'girl-next-door', 'quality', 'quite', 'endearing', 'beautiful', 'not', 'unattainable', 'way', 'also', 'natural', 'comedic', 'ability', 'example', 'one', 'scene', 'Jenna', 'up', 'magazine', 'boring', 'party', 'impromptu', 'dance', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Thriller', 'inspiring', 'others', 'get', 'up', 'dance', 'as', 'well', 'Garner', 'also', 'very', 'expressive', 'face', 'perfect', 'broad', 'comedy', 'movie', 'willing', 'take', 'risks', 'make', 'fun', 'herself', 'also', 'willing', 'put', 'there', 'not', 'afraid', 'appear', 'goofy', 'only', 'much', 'more', 'appealing.13', 'Going', '30', 'victim', 'dreaded', 'double', 'dip', 'already', 'own', 'Special', 'Edition', 'version', 'movie', 'two', 'new', 'extras', 'hardly', 'warrant', 're-purchase', 'Also', 'already', 'own', 'previous', 'edition', 'might', 'want', 'hold', 'onto', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Gary', 'Winick', 'commentary', 'producers', 'Gina', 'Matthews', 'Donna', 'Arkoff-Roth', 'Susan', 'Arnold', 'not', 'edition.New', 'edition', 'Fashion', 'Flashback', '1980s', 'teen', 'models', 'gushing', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'retro', 'look', '80s', 'what', 'look', 'where', 'track', 'down', 'authentic', 'clothes', 'era', 'Making', 'Teen', 'Dream', 'making', 'movie', 'fun', 'breezy', 'way', 'customary', 'most', 'press', 'kit', 'type', 'featurettes', 'cast', 'speak', 'admiringly', 'other', 'self-congratulatory', 'Bloopers', 'reel', 'collection', 'blown', 'lines', 'other', 'assorted', 'goofs', 'are', 'quite', 'cute.Also', 'included', 'are', 'two', 'music', 'videos', 'one', 'Pat', 'Benatar', 'Love', 'Battlefield', 'Jessie', 'Girl', 'Rick', 'Springfield', 'immerse', 'pure', '80s', 'cheese.The', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'extra', 'Was', 'Teenage', 'Geek', 'cast', 'talk', 'what', 'were', '80s', 'Everyone', 'amusing', 'stories', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'high', 'school', 'photos', 'what', 'looked', 'time.There', 'also', 'Alternate', 'Beginning', 'Ending', 'different', 'actors', 'playing', 'Jenna', 'Matt', 'when', 'were', 'kids', 'scene', 'same', 'length', 'what', 'movie', 'edited', 'differently', 'get', 'more', 'detail', 'Jenna', 'desire', 'be', 'one', 'popular', 'girls', 'Thankfully', 'were', 'not', 'used.Finally', 'are', '15', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'more', 'footage', 'Jenna', 'Matt', 'magazine', 'party', 'so', 'scenes', 'flesh', 'out', 'relationships', 'characters']",N/A

168378,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,1404918051,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[67, 79]","I was rather pleasantly surprised by this film.  Obviously, the storyline is by no means unique, and I've seen too many films featuring kids and adults miraculously switching places to feel all that confident about going once more into a similar breach, but 13 Going on 30 is actually, well, delightful.  I'm a big Jennifer Garner fan going all the way back to her role in the short-lived Time of Your Life; by and large, I think she did a wonderful job in this role.  It is certainly a different Jennifer Garner than we see on Alias, and it certainly appears as if she relished a role in which she got to be silly and whimsical.  I would have to credit Mark Ruffalo with an even more impressive performance, though, as his was the subtle glue that held the fantastical elements of the plot together.Young Jenna has just turned 13; already unhappy with the way she looks and anxious to be popular, she suffers an embarrassing indignation which has her fervently wishing to be 30.  Thanks to some wishing dust on the model dream home her obviously infatuated by ""not cool"" friend Matt built for her, she gets her wish.  I thought the early scenes featuring 13-year-old Jenna reacting to the instant passing of 17 years and adjusting to her new, uh, accessories was a little awkward, and a certain lack of continuity in regard to her reactions to new stimuli popped up sporadically as the film progressed.  One minute she's acting like a young teenager, and then she will suddenly seem to have grown up into her new age to a significant degree.  Anyway, she discovers that all of her dreams have come true: she was popular, and she has become mighty successful in life - actually sitting atop the fashion magazine she was addicted to as a kid.  Before long, though, she begins to see that having it all isn't all it is cracked up to be.  This grown-up body she inhabits is actually a rather empty shell of a not so nice person.  She learns that she has done some rather nasty things over the course of the missing 17 years.  The only person she can turn to is her friend Matt (Mark Ruffalo), but the two have gone in very different directions over the years.  In the process of trying to save her magazine, Jenna learns that the dreams of childhood don't turn out the way you thought they would and other obvious life lessons, etc., etc.  You can probably guess what happens at the end.The film does succeed rather well as a comedy; the Thriller dance scene, while uncomfortable to watch, is indeed quite silly, and some of adult Jenna's interactions with young teens also play well.  I also loved the fact that the movie helped take me back to the 1980s, to some degree.  There are some classic 80s tunes on the soundtrack, and beginning the film with the sound of the Go-Go's definitely qualifies for a star in my book.  That being said, I have to say that I don't remember some of the awful hair-dos of the film actually existing in the late 80s - certainly not among the girls my eyes gravitated toward in those halcyon days of youth.In the end, this is basically your silly, entertaining, feel-good comedy, and it stars one of Hollywood's most attractive, talented actresses.  It doesn't try to be anything more than what it is, and that is a big reason why it works as well as it does.  It is by no means a must-see, but I do believe it is a film you cannot help but enjoy.",5,"A surprisingly delightful, feel-good comedy",1101686400,"11 29, 2004",2004,3377,"['was', 'rather', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'film', 'Obviously', 'storyline', 'means', 'unique', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'featuring', 'kids', 'adults', 'miraculously', 'switching', 'places', 'feel', 'confident', 'going', 'once', 'more', 'similar', 'breach', '13', 'Going', '30', 'actually', 'well', 'delightful', ""'m"", 'big', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'fan', 'going', 'way', 'back', 'role', 'short-lived', 'Time', 'Your', 'Life', 'large', 'think', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'role', 'certainly', 'different', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'see', 'Alias', 'certainly', 'relished', 'role', 'got', 'be', 'silly', 'whimsical', 'would', 'have', 'credit', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'performance', 'though', 'was', 'subtle', 'glue', 'held', 'fantastical', 'elements', 'plot', 'together.Young', 'Jenna', 'just', 'turned', '13', 'already', 'unhappy', 'way', 'anxious', 'be', 'popular', 'embarrassing', 'indignation', 'fervently', 'wishing', 'be', '30', 'Thanks', 'wishing', 'dust', 'model', 'dream', 'home', 'obviously', 'infatuated', 'not', 'cool', 'friend', 'Matt', 'built', 'her', 'wish', 'thought', 'early', 'scenes', 'featuring', '13-year-old', 'Jenna', 'reacting', 'instant', 'passing', '17', 'years', 'adjusting', 'new', 'uh', 'accessories', 'was', 'little', 'awkward', 'certain', 'lack', 'continuity', 'regard', 'reactions', 'new', 'stimuli', 'popped', 'up', 'sporadically', 'film', 'progressed', 'One', 'minute', 'acting', 'young', 'teenager', 'then', 'will', 'suddenly', 'seem', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'new', 'age', 'significant', 'degree', 'Anyway', 'dreams', 'have', 'come', 'true', 'was', 'popular', 'become', 'mighty', 'successful', 'life', 'actually', 'sitting', 'fashion', 'magazine', 'was', 'addicted', 'kid', 'long', 'though', 'see', 'having', ""n't"", 'cracked', 'up', 'be', 'grown-up', 'body', 'actually', 'rather', 'empty', 'shell', 'not', 'so', 'nice', 'person', 'done', 'rather', 'nasty', 'things', 'course', 'missing', '17', 'years', 'only', 'person', 'can', 'turn', 'friend', 'Matt', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'two', 'have', 'gone', 'very', 'different', 'directions', 'years', 'process', 'trying', 'save', 'magazine', 'Jenna', 'dreams', 'childhood', 'do', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'way', 'thought', 'would', 'other', 'obvious', 'life', 'lessons', 'etc.', 'etc', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'what', 'end.The', 'film', 'succeed', 'rather', 'well', 'comedy', 'Thriller', 'dance', 'scene', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'indeed', 'quite', 'silly', 'adult', 'Jenna', 'interactions', 'young', 'teens', 'also', 'play', 'well', 'also', 'loved', 'fact', 'movie', 'helped', 'take', 'back', '1980s', 'degree', 'are', 'classic', '80s', 'tunes', 'soundtrack', 'beginning', 'film', 'sound', 'Go-Go', 'definitely', 'qualifies', 'star', 'book', 'being', 'said', 'have', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'awful', 'hair-dos', 'film', 'actually', 'existing', 'late', '80s', 'certainly', 'not', 'girls', 'eyes', 'gravitated', 'halcyon', 'days', 'youth.In', 'end', 'basically', 'silly', 'entertaining', 'feel-good', 'comedy', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'attractive', 'talented', 'actresses', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'what', 'big', 'reason', 'why', 'as', 'well', 'means', 'must-see', 'do', 'believe', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'enjoy']",N/A

Whewreas in the previous movie Hanks character stays in the 1980s when he receives instant adulthood, in this movie an element of time travel is involved when 13 year-old Jenna goes to sleep in 1987 and wakes up all grown up in 2004.The movie is all the better for this plot device, we get to see where most of the characters from 1987 are now, and the implications of the decision Jenna makes at the beginning of the movie. Its both piognant, romantic and funny in its execution and you would be pressed to find a truly more involving comedy drama in recent years.Carrying the movie is star of television show ALIAS, the impossibly beautiful and talented Jennifer Garner. She proves that her entertaining turn as Sydney Bristow was no fluke by ably showing of her comic timing and delivery. Not a slam-bang comedy of the Ben Stiller or Adam Sandler vein this movie is more subtle and less in your-face.As a 32-year old who remembers 1987 well the pop culture references to that era in the initial scenes were drenched in nostalgia and as someone who has chosen a similar career path as Garner's character it is even more involving and interesting. Without giving too much of the well crafted story away, this movie makes you reflect on the decisions you make and the impilcations each decision makes.

Somewhere along the line, I am not sure it did that for Jennifer, but it is a fun film, and she is spectacular.Fundamentally we pretty much know how it is all going to turn out, but these ingredients really help in making the whold thing workGarner is hilariously upbeat, and the concept of her finding out what has happened to her in the past 17 years is kind of cool twist.Mark Rufalo seems like a weird romantic comedy lead, but he does a great job in the movie.  Because the character is a bit of a loner, with a bit of a secret, Rufalo is able to put his method acting qualities to very good efffect.The first section is set in the 80's.  Who doesn't love trashing the 80's.I must admit that the concept kind of creeped me out, a thirteen year old girl in a 30 year old body, with thirty year old men hitting on her.  Yes, it is the same with BIG, and unfortunately, the coming of age of young men is sort of looked at as a touchstone, whereas the coming of age of young women is looked on as gross and purient when there is 17 years difference between them.  This however is handled with great care...the one scene with the man hitting on her in the restaurant is fantastic.all in all, it is a great, fun movie....a little diverted by the ""fashion magazine"" plot...but it has good laughs, a sort of a tugging at your heart element, and it is joyous to see Garner and Rufalo.but I could've done without the special feature of all the pretty movie stars talking about what big geeks they were",4,a formula with great ingedients,1108598400,"02 17, 2005",2005,1711,"['mentioned', 'formula', 'piece', 'making', 'bones', 'fact', 'basically', 'Big', 'girls', 'Big', 'put', 'TomHanks', 'forefront', 'comic', 'actors', 'film', 'was', 'do', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Somewhere', 'line', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'did', 'Jennifer', 'fun', 'film', 'spectacular.Fundamentally', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'how', 'going', 'turn', 'out', 'ingredients', 'really', 'help', 'making', 'whold', 'thing', 'workGarner', 'hilariously', 'upbeat', 'concept', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'past', '17', 'years', 'kind', 'cool', 'twist.Mark', 'Rufalo', 'weird', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'lead', 'great', 'job', 'movie', 'character', 'bit', 'loner', 'bit', 'secret', 'Rufalo', 'able', 'put', 'method', 'acting', 'qualities', 'very', 'good', 'efffect.The', 'first', 'section', 'set', '80', 'Who', ""n't"", 'love', 'trashing', ""80's.I"", 'must', 'admit', 'concept', 'kind', 'creeped', 'out', 'thirteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', '30', 'year', 'old', 'body', 'thirty', 'year', 'old', 'men', 'hitting', 'Yes', 'same', 'BIG', 'unfortunately', 'coming', 'age', 'young', 'men', 'sort', 'looked', 'touchstone', 'coming', 'age', 'young', 'women', 'looked', 'gross', 'purient', 'when', '17', 'years', 'difference', 'however', 'handled', 'great', 'care', 'one', 'scene', 'man', 'hitting', 'restaurant', 'fantastic.all', 'great', 'fun', 'movie', '.a', 'little', 'diverted', 'fashion', 'magazine', 'plot', 'good', 'laughs', 'sort', 'tugging', 'heart', 'element', 'joyous', 'see', 'Garner', 'Rufalo.but', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'special', 'feature', 'pretty', 'movie', 'talking', 'what', 'big', 'geeks', 'were']",N/A

168388,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,1404918051,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[10, 10]","When this film came out back in 2004, I felt it was a fantastic romantic comedy. Romantic, charming and enjoyable.With two great performances by Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo, there were many things that made this film so enjoyable.  From the beautiful locations the film was shot in New York, a funny but touching storyline but also that 80's style, may it be the clothing or the music of that time and with one of the most memorable dance scenes in a film with everyone jamming to Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"", ""13 going on 30' is all out fun!Here we are five years later and with two DVD releases, the popular romantic comedy will now be released on Blu-ray.  So, I'm sure many of you who owned a previous version of the film on DVD maybe wondering, if this Blu-ray release is worth it?  Read on!VIDEO & AUDIO:""13 going on 30' is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  Video quality is clean and the film looks very good.  But picture quality is not super colorful  in terms of eye popping visuals but overall, this film looks even greater on Blu-ray.  Personally, I think this is the test transfer we will probably see of this film for years to come.  Also, with so much outdoor shots featuring both Garner and Ruffalo with their characters in different parts of New York City, Blu-ray definitely enhances the city compared to the DVD version.As for the audio, audio is presented in Dolby TrueHD for English, French and Portuguese and 5.1 Dolby Digital for the other language tracks.  The film is primarily dialogue and I don't recall hearing any uses of the rear channels for any outdoor ambiance for audio.  The music definitely comes out clear and pronounced and livens up the room.SPECIAL FEATURES:""13 going on 30' is literally packed with special features.  Many of these were featured on the ""Fun & Flirty Version"" DVD but one featurette is exclusive to Blu-ray:# Director's Commentary - This commentary features Director Gary Winick.  Winick is one of those director's that you would love to hear his commentary because he expresses his true emotion of his feelings of the film, which parts of the film he would love to have reshot and really, getting good insight on the film.  Especially the ""Thriller"" dance scene to the final ending.# Producers Commentary - This commentary features Susan Arnold, Donna Arkoff Roth and Gina Matthews.  Each of these three women giving their tidbits of the film, working with Director Gary Winick and working with the talent.# Alternate Beginning and Alternate Ending - This was surprising because the characters that played Jenna and Matt were different actors and I am so glad this beginning and ending was not used in the final cut of the film.# Deleted Scenes - A total of 18 deleted scenes featured.# Blooper Reel - This is a fun blooper reel of the whole cast.# The Making of a Teen Dream - This was the original featurette featured on the DVD versions.  This was all about the making of the film and interviews with the director, producers and cast.# Making of a Teen Dream: Another Take - This is exclusive to the Blu-ray and features more content such as Jennifer Garner actually having to do a slumber party with the 13-year-olds  as part of her research for her character.# I Was a Teenage Geek Featurette - This interview features the main actors and actresses of the film talking about their high school life with high school photos and all.# 1980s ""Fashion Flashback"" Featurette - This is more or less a fashion flashback photoshoot and dressing up people with 80's fashion.# Pat Benatar's ""Love is a Battlefield"" Music Video# Rick Springfield's ""Jessie's Girl"" Music Video# Video Gallery - A photo montage from scenes in the filmThe disc is also BD Live Enabled.""13 going on 30' is just  a fun romantic comedy that I have enjoyed countless times.  Not because I'm a child of the 80's but I really enjoyed the charming performances by Garner and Ruffalo, the overall story, the music and the awesome shots of New York City.  Everything came together for this film.Although considered as a ""date film' or a ""Girl's Night Out"" type of film, as a guy who enjoyed the film, you can't help be touched because of Ruffalo's portrayal of Matt.  Guys get dumped or rejected by girls.  That close bond you have with a female friend in high school or friends period, not always last through adulthood.  And for Matty, you can literally sense the pain this guy goes through of having the girl he cared for (and eventually hurt him and abandoned him) in high school coming back to his life (especially when he's about to get married).  So, there are many aspects that a guy can relate to in this film.But was this film perfect?  Not really.  For music, by 1987, Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"", Pat Benatar's ""Love is a Battlefield"", the Go-Go's ""Head over Heels"" and even Rick Springfield's ""Jessie's Girl"" were old news and were released way before 1987.  Music by that time was all about Bon Jovi, the Beastie Boys, Prince, The Jets and LL Cool J.  But of course, people who didn't grow up during that time period probably wouldn't know that, so I guess it's not really important.If you own the DVD, is it worth owning on Blu-ray?  Of course, the Blu-ray version is featured in 1080p and the audio is featured in Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  This is probably the best video and audio quality we will ever see of this film.  But are there considerable difference from the DVD version.  Not really.  You're only getting one extra special feature on the Blu-ray versus the ""Fun & Flirty version"" on DVD.  But if you don't own this film on DVD or if you have only the first version of the DVD, then this Blu-ray release is definitely worth it, especially if you enjoyed the film.All in all, I enjoyed this film a lot.  I enjoyed it back in 2004 and continue to enjoy it now even after watching it several times.  ""13 going on 30' is a romantic comedy that can be watched and enjoyed for many years to come.

Even when watching ""Big"" in 1988, the premise on which this movie was based on, the main character was from a time that I didn't know.I felt so old watching ""13 Going On 30"" because I could very much relate to 1987, being 11 years old then, and I kept thinking, ""That hair and makeup is so on target.""  I remember wanting to skip over the horror and confusion of the teenage years myself then - skip past those annoying cliques and raging hormones - and just become an adult.  I also remember those cheesy hairstyles and the corny music (I rolled my eyes at the continuous stream of those god-awful 80's tunes, although the Go Go's ""Head Over Heels"" as the opening song was a great fit).No need to rehash the plot (the female version of ""Big,"" with '90's references thrown in) but Jennifer Garner was cute in her role as the adult Jenna Rink, who realizes, how many people she hurt on her way to number one (including the very magazine she worked for - she was sabotaging her own magazine by continually supplying a stream of ideas to their main rival magazine).  Mark Ruffalo played the adult Matt, Jenna's former boyfriend, a guy who she carelessly tossed on her way to popularity.For those who expect that Jenna and Mark will meet again as adults and everything will turn out great because she went from being a teenager to an adult overnight are in for a surprise.  While they got themselves reacquainted as adults, in the end, Matt decides to marry someone else, telling Jenna, on his wedding day, that ""you can't turn back the hands of time.""  The damage that she did to him was irreversible (as it is in real life).Matt gives Jenna the dollhouse he built for her when they were teenagers and, going to the back of the house where he's getting married in, the wind blows the remainder of the wishing dust on Jenna, transporting her back to 1987, and the party she left while she was blindfolded in the closet (waiting for one of the popular guys to kiss her, a trick played on her by the clique she wanted desperately to become part of).She returns to the party, seeing what happened to her as an adult, kisses Matt, ditches the clique, and Jenna and Matt wind up marrying and moving into their house, after all.Too bad real life can't mirror celluloid.

MacLean,"[2, 4]","Let me say first of all that I am a huge Jennifer Garner fan, but I liked nearly everything else about this movie too.The casting was great, I really enjoyed the music, and the story (a sort of female version of Big) was predictable but very enjoyable.  It is FUN, which is just what it set out to be.The special edition DVD features were fairly extensive, giving insight into both the production and the actors' personal experiences as teenagers.  I enjoyed the blooper reel, but it left me wanting more, as it looked like they had lots of fun on the sets.  Some of the deleted scenes really would have helped continuity a bit, had they *not* been deleted.Jennifer Garner (as Jenna Rink) gives a thoroghly enjoyable performance.  She is utterly believable as a 13yr old in a 30yr old's body, especially nearer the beginning of her ""time warp.""  Jenna is so sweet and [unintentionally] funny, and does a phenomenal (if not very realistic) job of growing up in a hurry.  ""Magazine Publishing for Dummies,"" indeed.  Ms. Garner does a fantastic job of emoting -- every emotion comes through loud and clear, and she really takes you with her.  As I said before, I'm a huge fan, and therefore biased, but I just loved Jenna Rink.Mark Ruffalo (as Matt Flamhaff) does a terrific job as an all-around [understandably conflicted] good guy.  Matt & Jenna were best friends when they were 13, and then they weren't.  But when she comes knockin' he's not bitter.  Cynical maybe, cautious maybe, still a little wounded, but still concerned that his former friend is upset.  Been there, done that, and I *reach*, brother.  I believed it.  ""Arrivederci. [...] Au revoir.""  I loved that bit where he knew what she meant but didn't want to loosen up and play the game at first.As for the supporting cast, Judy Greer (Lucy), Marcia DeBonis (Jenna's assistant Arlene), and Andy Serkis (Richard) were all great.  From Lucy's *attitude* to Arlene's cowering to Richard's moonwalk, they all gave gave gave.  The kids were great too -- just the right mix of teenage awkwardness, angst, optimism, and herd behavior.The whole production was nicely done, with subtle touches such as Young Jenna's blindfold sort of morphing into Adult Jenna's sleep mask when she wakes up 30.  Coolest music moment:  Young Chris Grandy arriving to Talking Heads' ""Burning Down the House.""  The ending was done so effectively that I just choked up on the spot.  I can't recall a better-done ending.

168401,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,1404918051,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[4, 4]","There was a movie that came out a few years ago starring Tom Hanks called ""Big."" I never saw ""Big"" but I know what it is about nonetheless. It is about a boy who wants to be grown up or, well, big. He wakes up one mourning and he is still in the same year, except he is an adult. ""13 Going on 30"" is about a 13 year old girl who wants to be 30 years ago, and because of some magical wishing dust, she wakes up 17 years later looking like Jennifer Garner. The difference is that in ""Big"" the only thing that changes is Tom Hanks. Everything changes for Jennifer Garner in ""13 Going on 30.""""13 Going on 30"" is one of those movies where you know everything that is going to happen before you sit down. As the movie goes on, you could figure out all of the little things that are going to happen. There is nothing really new going on in this movie. What makes it good is the way actress Jennifer Garner handles the role. Jennifer Garner's last movie is ""Daredevil,"" and in that film she was too busy fighting and having sex with Ben Afflick to really have a role. In this movie, it is her first leading role, and she is able to handle the film by herself. She is the main star, and not the co-star like she normally is. She also proves that she has a knack for comedy movies. I predict that we will be seeing more movies with her in them in the future.The movie starts in 1987 and we meet Jenna Rink, who is a 13 year old girl who wants to be older. On her birthday, she invites the popular girls, including Lucy, to her party. They trick her in a very mean way, leading her to yell and get mad at her friend and next door neighbor Matt. She wishes that she was 30 years old, and her wish comes true after magic wishing dust sprinkles on the top of her head. The next day, she is a beautiful 30 year old in the year 2004. She has no idea what is going on, and whose house she is in, and who the strange man that is in her bathroom is. She finds out that she is the editor of her favorite magazine, and her best friend is that girl Lucy from when they were kids. Both of them work for Richard Kneeland. Jenna finds the grown up Matt, and learns that they have not been friends since the day of her birthday party, and have not even seen each other since high school ended. Matt isn't happy to see Jenna, and Jenna also finds out that while he became a very good photographer, she has become a very bad person that not many people like. More bad news happens when it turns out that a rival magazine is stealing their ideas. Jenna suddenly finds herself falling in love with Matt, and trying to save her company from being no more.Another good part of ""13 Going on 30"" is Andy Serkis. Andy Serkis was not in this movie much, but his preformance was very well done. He played Gollum in ""The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers,"" and ""The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King."" Him and Jennifer Garner probably saved this entire movie from being a flop. I like how Jennifer Garner acted like a 13 year old in her body. She did what Jamie Lee Curtis did in ""Freaky Friday"" which was another great preformance. I liked ""13 Going on 30."" It was not a great film, but it was an amusing way to spend two hours or so. I am looking forward to the next movies that Jennifer Garner makes.ENJOY!Rated PG-13 for some sexual content and brief drug references.",4,Jennifer Garner Shines!,1084665600,"05 16, 2004",2004,3339,"['was', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'starring', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'called', 'Big', 'never', 'saw', 'Big', 'know', 'what', 'nonetheless', 'boy', 'who', 'be', 'grown', 'up', 'well', 'big', 'up', 'one', 'mourning', 'still', 'same', 'year', 'adult', '13', 'Going', '30', '13', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'be', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'magical', 'wishing', 'dust', 'up', '17', 'years', 'later', 'looking', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'difference', 'Big', 'only', 'thing', 'changes', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Everything', 'changes', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', '13', 'Going', '30', '13', 'Going', '30', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'know', 'everything', 'going', 'happen', 'sit', 'down', 'movie', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'little', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'happen', 'nothing', 'really', 'new', 'going', 'movie', 'What', 'good', 'way', 'actress', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'role', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'last', 'movie', 'Daredevil', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'fighting', 'having', 'sex', 'Ben', 'Afflick', 'really', 'have', 'role', 'movie', 'first', 'leading', 'role', 'able', 'handle', 'film', 'herself', 'main', 'star', 'not', 'co-star', 'normally', 'also', 'knack', 'comedy', 'movies', 'predict', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'more', 'movies', 'future.The', 'movie', '1987', 'meet', 'Jenna', 'Rink', 'who', '13', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'be', 'older', 'birthday', 'popular', 'girls', 'including', 'Lucy', 'party', 'trick', 'very', 'mean', 'way', 'leading', 'yell', 'get', 'mad', 'friend', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Matt', 'was', '30', 'years', 'old', 'wish', 'true', 'magic', 'wishing', 'dust', 'sprinkles', 'top', 'head', 'next', 'day', 'beautiful', '30', 'year', 'old', 'year', '2004', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'house', 'who', 'strange', 'man', 'bathroom', 'out', 'editor', 'favorite', 'magazine', 'best', 'friend', 'girl', 'Lucy', 'when', 'were', 'kids', 'work', 'Richard', 'Kneeland', 'Jenna', 'grown', 'up', 'Matt', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'friends', 'day', 'birthday', 'party', 'have', 'not', 'even', 'seen', 'other', 'high', 'school', 'ended', 'Matt', ""n't"", 'happy', 'see', 'Jenna', 'Jenna', 'also', 'out', 'became', 'very', 'good', 'photographer', 'become', 'very', 'bad', 'person', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'More', 'bad', 'news', 'when', 'out', 'rival', 'magazine', 'stealing', 'ideas', 'Jenna', 'suddenly', 'falling', 'love', 'Matt', 'trying', 'save', 'company', 'being', 'more.Another', 'good', 'part', '13', 'Going', '30', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'was', 'not', 'movie', 'much', 'preformance', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'played', 'Gollum', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Two', 'Towers', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Return', 'King', 'Him', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'probably', 'saved', 'entire', 'movie', 'being', 'flop', 'how', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'acted', '13', 'year', 'old', 'body', 'did', 'what', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'did', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'was', 'great', 'preformance', 'liked', '13', 'Going', '30', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'amusing', 'way', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'so', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'movies', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'makes.ENJOY', 'Rated', 'PG-13', 'sexual', 'content', 'brief', 'drug', 'references']",N/A

I fell somewhere in the middle of these extremes.THE GOOD:1) Jennifer Garner just lights up the screen no matter what she's doing or whatever the script asks of her;2) Mark Ruffalo, who is always outstanding in more serious fare (""You Can Count On Me""), displays an unusual degree of charm and approachability that most of today's leading men could not conjure up;3) The premise, while not original, is fun and starts off very well;4) The director creates a wonderful palette of color that works very well in both time-frames;5) Many scenes are given a much needed lift via great songs from the 1980s;6) The movie actually surprised me a couple of times and for once one of the heroines ""rivals"" is not an easy to hate witch; and7) The ending, which I won't give away, made me smile and that is not a bad thing at all.THE NOT SO GOOD/AWFUL:1) The script is simple a mess. It has no structure nor explanations as to why the leading character turned out to be the ubber witch that she allegedly turned out to be;2) The whole magazine ""redesign"" plot development and associated plot links simply does not cut it as they are poorly executed and simply make no sense;3) While Jennifer Garner works her magic with the slim pickings that she gets, but the movie spends way too little time getting into how a 13 year-old would feel if she woke up and was 30 years old. There is so much potential comic relief and the character would have been more grounded if the writer had spent any time trying to go beyond what essentially becomes a very badly written movie about corporate America;4) The DVD has a series of deleted scenes that may have helped to shape the movie better as it has the feel of a cut and paste that it tries to hide with songs from the 1980s.From the above you may get the impression that I really disliked this movie, but that is not the case. Jennifer Garner's presence and my desire to see something frothy made this the perfect rental. I cannot give it a strong recommendation because it's a mess, but it has cute moments and sometimes gets it right.

But let's not twist this, there are many moments worth watching in 13 GOING ON 30. Above all, you're dragged along in the wake of Jennifer Garner's charm and the infectious joy with which she plays Jenna. Not that she's produced a lot of stuff on the silver screen, but 13 GOING ON 30, breezy and laugh-out-loud funny, is without a doubt my favorite Jennifer Garner flick.It's all about wish fulfillment, and, because we've already seenBig (Extended Edition)andFreaky Friday, we already know that the inherent lesson here is that be content within yourself and also that there's no place like home. It's a given that Jenna Rink will learn this lesson in due time, but not just yet. Because that would deny us the pleasure of watching then 32-year-old Jennifer Garner go thru her silly shenanigans. So, first, whilst being doused in magic dust, thirteen-year-old Jenna, experiencing a disastrous birthday, wishes that she were ""thirty and flirty and thriving."" She then wakes up to find herself in a beautiful 30-year-old body. What's more, she now resides in New York City in her own posh apartment and holding down a gig as a big-time fashion magazine editor.The movie then shows us obligatory (yet wickedly humorous) scenes of Jenna striving to act mature, and not quite getting there. I got a quick chuckle from a brief shot of Jenna scoping out ""Magazine Publishing for Dummies."" Plenty of fun call-backs to 1980s pop culture, to a time when people really were that into Rick Springfield and where ""Everybody Wang Chung tonight"" kind of meant something. Me, I barely remember Razzles, let alone that they're both a candy AND a gum.And then, as they're wont to do, the movie gets a bit serious (but, thankfully, not too serious). We learn that the woman Jenna had become is not a nice person. We also learn that the magazine she works for is suffering an alarming decline in popularity and in sales. Tons of pressure on Jenna, regarded as a bright star in the world of haute couture periodicals. Will Jenna get her act together? Will she make amends with her estranged former best friend Mattie, played, by the way, with down-to-earth appeal by Mark Ruffalo?It's key that Jennifer Garner is not at all afraid of looking silly and awkward here. It's key that she's a good enough actress that we come to care for her character. And it's important that Ruffalo is around to provide grounded support and that dang good romantic spark. Meanwhile, subtly duplicitous and a bit buggy-eyed, Judy Greer is pitch perfect as Jenna's current best friend. And, yes, I dare you high school graduates of the '80s to not get all nostalgic when the soundtrack kicks up. I can't believe I forgot how much I liked Billy Joel's ""Vienna Waits for You."" I've never really been a fan of Pat Benatar's ""Love Is A Battlefield"" but the movie's use of it as an anthem is pretty well done.I've been digging Jennifer Garner since her superspy days in ALIAS, and when 13 GOING ON 30 came out, I figured this was just the stage to propel her to bigger and better things. But, for some reason, she's kept a low profile in the years following 2004, excepting all the trashy Bennifer media blitz (yet another reason to dislike Ben Affleck). Thankfully, her recent good turns inThe Kingdom (Widescreen Edition)andJuno (Two-Disc Special Edition with Digital Copy)have gotten her back on track. But, while she's shown off her dramatic skills in these other roles, to me, she was still never better than when she was ""thirty and flirty and thriving.""

Can Jenna have her cake and eat it too and if she does, what will happen to her?IN A NUTSHELL: COOL AGE APPROPRIATE FILM THAT DEALS WITH REAL ISSUESWell done age appropriate comedy that underscores the universal frustration and impatience that teenage girls are known for. However, this movie's theme is about doing something about it, and to that end the film takes Jenna on a magical mystery time voyage which lands her right where she thinks she wants to be ---- 30 - COOOOOOL & HOT!But is that exactly what she wanted?THANKFULLY THERE'S MORE ---- IT'S ABOUT SELF-AWARENESSThere is a price to pay for this jump to age thirty, and as the movie progresses, Jenna becomes more aware of that and more importantly; MORE 'SELF-AWARE' IN THIS LEARNING PROCESS! Exactly what Jenna discovers in this process is what the film is all about.Needless to say, this is a well done fantasy that literally every girl has probably contemplated at one time or another in one way or another.

""13 GOING ON 30"" is definitely one of the better teen flicks out there, and it nicely melds fantasy with a girls viewpoint into a somewhat familiar though original story.IN GOOD TASTE WITHOUT PATRONIZING OR CONDESCENDING TO TEENS OR PARENTSFor parents, this is both an enlightening film, and a kind of time-capsule that is executed with surprisingly good tastes.

And the supposed irony of him growing up to play with toys for a job annoyed me even when I was 8  years old. I knew adult life wasn't like that. For all of it's ridiculousness, 13 going on 30 is much better.Plus it's more of a time travel movie than body-morph. It examines who we are as kids and how we end up as adults. It deals with relationships and lost innocence. Something far more interesting and relevant than anything BIG ever did. Plus Jennifer Garner is more easy on the eye than Tom Hanks. I wasn't keen on Mark Ruffalo being in this (I will NEVER forgive his moustache in IN THE CUT) but his character was (intentionaly) blank and emotionless enough for his performance to be unintrusive and he did a good job with it. It's difficult to care for a statue.The Gollum guy playing Jennifer's boss was pretty much stereotyped and none of the other characters had much depth. There was no reason to get involved when you know their problems will become undone by the time-travel plot.A nice way to spend a rainy afternoon.

Anyway, sometimes I like to watch ""Comedies"" sometimes I pick an ""Action packed movie"" sometimes a ""Drama"" it depends on my mood for the day and sometimes though very rarely I like to watch a ""Romantic Comedy"" otherwise known as ""Chick Flicks"" and that's when I oh came across this movie.I have to say that I'm not a Jennifer Garner fan, It's not that I don't like her. I was just never a fan of hers since the ""Alias"" days and ""Ghost of Girlfriend's Past"" was just totally not my cup of tea so I wasn't really sure about this movie despite the good reviews but surprisingly I didn't like it, I LOVED it ! This movie was amazing and pretty darn good. It's a fun movie to watch a one that you could see with your girlfriends or on a girl's night or something. It's everything a chick-flick is supposed to be, it's funny (in a non-profane way), interesting and oh the love story is a delight ! It's been so long since I've seen a chick-flick that made me feel so .... relaxed ? Good ?So, Anyway the plot. It's the 80s and 13 year old Jenna (Jennifer Garner) is still in middle/high school not sure which but one of em. Like most girls that age she's really concerned about her looks and sadly lacks confidence. Of course there are this group of popular girls who are also mean and Jenna wants to be like them cuz she thinks they're cool and all despite what her best friend Matty (Mark Ruffalo) tells her about em. So, On Jenna's 13 B-day party she invites those mean girls who only come to take the homework that she made for them and they play a dirty trick on her, this trick eventually has a bad effect on Jenna's personality so she sets in a corner crying wishing that she was THIRTY,FLIRTY AND THRIVING. Comes morning, Jenna wakes up and viola ! It's 2004. She's all grown up, lives in her own apartment, has a job as fashion magazine editor and got a bf too. Along with that comes a big collection of dresses, hand bags, make-up and shoes lots of shoes ! Life seems perfect, but only from the outside. Jenna discovers that well she's just not the same person anymore.I really liked this movie ! I laughed and I cried near the end too. I know the premise may not be that Original but still I had fun watching this film, I'll probably watch it again whenever I'm down. Jennifer Garner's performance is wonderful ! I totally believed her as Jenna, she's really sucked up in the role. The other actors were good too and the music .... I didn't live in the 80s but I gotta tell ya 80s music is something !So, Yeah I recommend you pick this movie up, if it's on tv watch it. If you can rent it, rent it. If a friend has a dvd copy of it, borrow it sometime. It's definitely worth a watch if your into chick-flicks this is absolutely for you, you won't be disappointed (!)I really wish they make more movies like these nowadays chick-flicks and Rom/Com are more about sex and alcohol than about per say wishes coming true and going terribly bad or finding your self again.

168431,A1I4WW9TUYEA5Z,1404918051,James R. Williams,"[2, 3]","Jennifer Garner is a luminous actress with true screen presence, but in ""13 Going on 30"", her charms are put to shallow use and an otherwise perfect performance is wasted due to incompetent screenwriting. Instead of illuminating the script, Garner exists merely to distract audiences away from a tired plot about a thirteen-year-old girl named Jenna Rink who (by magic unknown to the audience) wakes up to find she is now thirty, lives in an apartment on Fifth Avenue, and is an editor of a New York fashion magazine called Poise.We see actors in body-switching formulas all the time from Tom Hanks in ""Big"" to Jamie Lee Curtis in the 2003 remake of ""Freaky Friday"", but these movies were a lot more fun than ""13 Going on 30"". This is not Garner's fault. I always believed her performance. She has the acting chops to equal Hanks and Curtis's work, but the script never allows her to truly shine.Over the course of the story, there are ample opportunities to turn the spotlight towards her, but the plot is more concerned about the happenings at the magazine office than it is with Jenna's sudden transition into adulthood. If screenwriters Cathy Yuspa and John Goldsmith, who penned the better 2000 supernatural office comedy, ""What Women Want"", had seen these obvious structural errors, they would have had a far superior film on their hands.We first meet Jenna (played in the early scenes by Christa B. Allen) on the day of her thirteenth birthday. She longs to be popular, even if it means being pushed around by Lucy ""Tom-Tom"" Wyman, leader of the ""Six Chicks"", an exclusive high school clique. After Jenna becomes the subject of a mean prank at her birthday party (concocted by Lucy), she blames her only real friend Matt, an awkward kid who lives next-door and secretly has a crush on her. Before long, Jenna is hiding in her basement closet wishing to be ""thirty, flirty, and thriving"" and thanks to a sprinkling of magic dust, her wish is granted.Once in her adult body, Jenna learns that she is still friends with Lucy (Judy Greer), who now works with her at Poise, but she has not spoken to Matt since the day of her thirteenth birthday. From this point on, the story keeps the undertakings at Poise in full focus and any spare time finds Jenna attempting to make amends with Matt, who is now handsome, successful, and engaged.The absence of logic is not the problem here.

What I want to say is, Jennifer Garner's new movie is not original, but then it's not its purpose to be something new, but to provide a funny and enjoyable time to its viewers. And that it does.After the ""Alias"" series and ""Daredevil"", Jennifer Garner has established herself as a very good action actress. She knows how to kick, how to run and how to punch bad guys in their faces. Now, it seems, she wants to be recognised as a comedy actress. She has convinced me. Her part in this movie is Jenna Rink, a common enough girl living in the eighties (lots of make-up, strage hairdos, etc.), striving to be popular in school, trying to get the attention of the good-looking boy and to be part of the nicest, meanest group of girls of her neighbourhood. Everything she plans fails and her life seems to be heading down the toilet (in her young opinion, of course). She wishes to be thirty and succesfull. Her wish is granted, of course.She wakes up trapped in her 30-year-old body (and what a body it is), but still with her old 13-year-old head. This provides many funny situations and dialogues, as expected. I couldn't help but laugh during most part of the movie. Jennifer Garner has a different, unusual beauty, and her past roles as action heroine helped her to develop the necessary boyish character of young girls. This combination of beauty and a woman with a successful career appeals to viewers of both sexes. I don't think this movie is to be considered a ""chick flick"", but as an ""everybody flick"", regardless of sex or age. Of course, if you are expecting something deep, go watch ""The pianist"". ""13 going on 30"" is light, easy and, as I have said before, pure fun.Mark Ruffalo is also good, portraying yet another different character in his resumee, now as the quiet and reclusive friend of Jenna's youth. Andy Serkis (the Gollum) is also funny as Jenna's gay boss. As for script, direction and ""moral lessons"", ""13 going on 30"" is not innovative or different.

168446,ARLKYF9JL3QKB,1404918051,J. SHARP,"[1, 1]","Jennifer Garner is easily one of the sweetest, most likeable actors who has ever lived. The reason ALIAS works so well is that her Sydney Bristow is so nice you root for her in every fight and hate it every time she's betrayed.Garner's likeability carries this movie. As has been said numerous times in numerous reviews, this is a harmless paint-by-numbers fantasy that doesn't ask anything of the audience. And that's fine. Is it an appropriate first headlining vehicle for a Golden Globe winner? I'm not sure. But she makes the most of it.The media are trying to call Garner the actual, genuine, honest-to-goodness, next ""new Julia Roberts."" Honestly, Garner has a much more accessible and attainable persona and appearance. And - while I like Julia - I think Jennifer has much more range.  Garner can clearly do broad comedy every bit as well as gut-wrenching drama and cutting-edge action.There are actual moments in ""13 Going on 30"" where you can see Garner and male lead Mark Ruffalo earnestly trying to improve the material without losing the fun. ""Okay, this is a weak line but if I just try to be honest, be the character, and believe it, it'll work."" And by and large, it does. They are talented people and you believe their characters really love each other.The rest of the film? Most of the supporting cast are merely archetypes, though a few character moments seep in. The workplace parts are more like what a kid would imagine office life to be. Does that mean that - as the Garner character first believes - this is all just a dream rather than a genuine time trip? Who knows? Does it matter? It's just for fun. And it succeeds in that.Although it's a bit too oblique considering what transpires, the resolution to the office intrigue is original and turns the feel-good rulebook on its ear. That was nearly as refreshing as Garner herself.As one who lived it, the '80s culture moments are often quite funny and sometimes truly nostalgic. Others have complained about the outdatedness of the artifacts ('Thriller' and Rick Springfield were ""lame"" by 1987, etc.) but that's quibbling.",4,Garner's first top bill is harmless fun,1082851200,"04 25, 2004",2004,2098,"['Jennifer', 'Garner', 'easily', 'one', 'sweetest', 'most', 'likeable', 'actors', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', 'reason', 'ALIAS', 'so', 'well', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'so', 'nice', 'root', 'fight', 'hate', 'time', 'betrayed.Garner', 'likeability', 'movie', 'been', 'said', 'numerous', 'times', 'numerous', 'reviews', 'harmless', 'paint-by-numbers', 'fantasy', ""n't"", 'ask', 'anything', 'audience', 'fine', 'appropriate', 'first', 'headlining', 'vehicle', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'winner', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'most', 'it.The', 'media', 'are', 'trying', 'call', 'Garner', 'actual', 'genuine', 'honest-to-goodness', 'next', 'new', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Honestly', 'Garner', 'much', 'more', 'accessible', 'attainable', 'persona', 'appearance', 'like', 'Julia', 'think', 'Jennifer', 'much', 'more', 'range', 'Garner', 'can', 'clearly', 'do', 'broad', 'comedy', 'bit', 'as', 'well', 'gut-wrenching', 'drama', 'cutting-edge', 'action.There', 'are', 'actual', 'moments', '13', 'Going', '30', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'Garner', 'male', 'lead', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'earnestly', 'trying', 'improve', 'material', 'losing', 'fun', 'Okay', 'weak', 'line', 'just', 'try', 'be', 'honest', 'be', 'character', 'believe', ""'ll"", 'work', 'large', 'are', 'talented', 'people', 'believe', 'characters', 'really', 'love', 'other.The', 'rest', 'film', 'Most', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'merely', 'archetypes', 'few', 'character', 'moments', 'seep', 'workplace', 'parts', 'are', 'more', 'what', 'kid', 'would', 'imagine', 'office', 'life', 'be', 'mean', 'Garner', 'character', 'first', 'just', 'dream', 'rather', 'genuine', 'time', 'trip', 'Who', 'matter', 'just', 'fun', 'bit', 'too', 'oblique', 'considering', 'what', 'resolution', 'office', 'intrigue', 'original', 'feel-good', 'rulebook', 'ear', 'was', 'nearly', 'as', 'refreshing', 'Garner', 'herself.As', 'one', 'who', 'lived', ""'80s"", 'culture', 'moments', 'are', 'often', 'quite', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'truly', 'nostalgic', 'Others', 'have', 'complained', 'outdatedness', 'artifacts', 'Rick', 'Springfield', 'were', 'lame', '1987', 'etc', 'quibbling']",N/A
168447,A28GCEHD00JFZG,1404918051,Julian Kennedy,"[0, 1]","13 Going on 30: 3 out of 10: First of all I would like to throw my full weight behind any effort to give Jennifer Garner a special Oscar for best performance in a pretty bad movie. She is delightful and plays the character better than written.In addition I would like to absolve any of her co-stars from any possible negative career ramifications due to their appearances in this film. They also did a fine job. And last I would like security to please apprehend the writers and director whom I see sneaking out the fire escape.Okay the director gets community service for making some pretty obvious soundtrack mistakes for 1987 (he highlights as the supposed geeky underground song Burning Down the House which was featured in as a jock anthem in Revenge of the Nerds three years earlier and as MTV fodder he highlights Thriller from 1983 which was already in the Halloween ghetto mix by 1987.) The writers get life in prison without parole. First question. Have they ever worked in any office anywhere, let alone a supposed fashion magazine? They get so much wrong I don't know where to begin. Second though Garner's performance is great her character is a mess. She finds older guys icky in one scene and is attracted to them in the next and then back to icky. She handles her cutthroat business environment with more maturity than most thirty year olds let alone thirteen year olds.Instead of going into a Being There Chauncey kind of vibe where Garner's character's inane utterances are taken as genius the film actually makes her more proactive than either her shy thirteen year old self would be or her cutthroat thirty year old self was. No working woman clich&eacute; is ignored and the less said about the sappy and ridiculous ending the better.The whole body swap time travel deal was actually the most believable part of the film. Certainly more believable than a doll house building, fairy dust collecting, fat boy next door growing up to be a thin straight single guy living in Greenwich Village or more than one drunk person remembering any of the dance moves from the Thriller video.",2,Not thrilling,1169164800,"01 19, 2007",2007,2099,"['13', 'Going', '30', '3', '10', 'First', 'would', 'like', 'throw', 'full', 'weight', 'effort', 'give', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'special', 'Oscar', 'best', 'performance', 'pretty', 'bad', 'movie', 'delightful', 'character', 'better', 'written.In', 'addition', 'would', 'like', 'absolve', 'co-stars', 'possible', 'negative', 'career', 'ramifications', 'due', 'appearances', 'film', 'also', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'last', 'would', 'like', 'security', 'please', 'apprehend', 'writers', 'director', 'whom', 'see', 'sneaking', 'out', 'fire', 'director', 'community', 'service', 'making', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'soundtrack', 'mistakes', '1987', 'supposed', 'geeky', 'underground', 'song', 'Burning', 'Down', 'House', 'was', 'featured', 'jock', 'anthem', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'three', 'years', 'earlier', 'MTV', 'fodder', 'Thriller', '1983', 'was', 'already', 'Halloween', 'ghetto', 'mix', '1987', 'writers', 'get', 'life', 'prison', 'parole', 'First', 'question', 'Have', 'ever', 'worked', 'office', 'anywhere', 'let', 'alone', 'supposed', 'fashion', 'magazine', 'get', 'so', 'much', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'Second', 'Garner', 'performance', 'great', 'character', 'mess', 'older', 'guys', 'icky', 'one', 'scene', 'attracted', 'next', 'then', 'back', 'icky', 'cutthroat', 'business', 'environment', 'more', 'maturity', 'most', 'thirty', 'year', 'olds', 'let', 'alone', 'thirteen', 'year', 'olds.Instead', 'going', 'Being', 'Chauncey', 'kind', 'vibe', 'where', 'Garner', 'character', 'inane', 'utterances', 'are', 'taken', 'genius', 'film', 'actually', 'more', 'proactive', 'shy', 'thirteen', 'year', 'old', 'self', 'would', 'be', 'cutthroat', 'thirty', 'year', 'old', 'self', 'was', 'No', 'working', 'woman', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ignored', 'less', 'said', 'sappy', 'ridiculous', 'ending', 'better.The', 'whole', 'body', 'swap', 'time', 'travel', 'deal', 'was', 'actually', 'most', 'believable', 'part', 'film', 'Certainly', 'more', 'believable', 'doll', 'house', 'building', 'fairy', 'dust', 'collecting', 'fat', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'growing', 'up', 'be', 'thin', 'straight', 'single', 'guy', 'living', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'more', 'one', 'drunk', 'person', 'remembering', 'dance', 'moves', 'Thriller', 'video']",N/A

Then I saw it was being likened to the famous Tom Hanks movie, Big, and was also getting excellent reviews.  I decided to go and see it, and I'm SO glad I did!The basic story is this:  A cute 13 year old girl named Jenna Rink wants nothing but to be popular and friends with the ""in"" crown.  She's best friends with her next door neighbor, Matt, but the cool girls don't like him so after they completely destroy her ego at her birthday party she ruins her friendship with Matt and wishes to become ""flirty and thirty"" like the women in her magazine.  *poof* She turns in to herself at 30... gorgeous, stylish, famous magazine editor with everything she ever wanted.Jenna begins to realize being everything she ever wanted isn't quite what it's cracked up to be, especially when she reunites with the now 30 Matt, who turned in to quite a babe (played by Mark Ruffalo).  There are some hilarious hijinks between the two as well as with Jenna at the magazine.  Jennifer Garner is absolutely PERFECT in the role as Jenna!  I thought she was cute, charismatic and played the role perfectly (well, except for the robotic acting in the first scene when she wakes up at 30).The supporting cast is great in this movie as well, especially Andy Serkis!  He's infamous now for playing Gollum in the amazing Lord of the Rings movie and he really steals the show here as Jenna's eccentric boss!  I'd never seen him in another role besides Gollum and I have to say, he was great!  Very funny, and I loved every minute he was on the screen!  Overall, this was a fantastic movie.  Deep and moving? No, but it's not supposed to be!  It's lighthearted, funny and has a great moral.

He's extremely skilled with actors, and I remember him way back when making a little movie with Michael Imperioli, the fellow who plays Christopher on The Sopranos, and Mira Sorvino from ROMY AND MICHELLE's HIGH SCHOOL REUNION.  In addition I believe his previous films featured the very last screen appearances of both Gregory Hines and George Plimpton, so you know he's used to working with the best.  Most of all, we remember Gary Winick for making TADPOLE, which if you remember was all about a very young boy who wanted to date a 40 year old woman, and how our bodies are wired to pick up romantic signals from even the most unlikely people.  Winick finds a sweet brand of comedy from all this, and you can see it in the might-have-been troubling scene in 13 GOING ON 30 in which Jennifer Garner goes over to pick up a 13 year old boy in a restaurant and is only stopped when Judy Greer tells her, ""Do you want to go to jail!""Both Garner and Greer make great impressions.  Garner is all over the place with her acting, but most of the time she successfully channels an adorable young girl.

168461,A2NJO6YE954DBH,1404918051,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 9]","&quot;13 Going on 30&quot; proves that Jennifer Garner is going to be a star mainly because her performance carries us along through the flaws in the screenplay by Josh Goldsmith &amp; Cathy Yuspa and Niels Mueller (guess who had it last).  Having been the killjoy Hannah on &quot;Felicity&quot; and only pretending to have fun as Sydney Bristow on &quot;Alias,&quot; Garner has a blast as Jenna Rink.  As a 13-year-old Jenna (Christa B. Allen) dreams of being one of the popular kids but she wishes to be &quot;thirty and flirty.&quot;  At her birthday party she is the target of a cruel prank by Tom Tom (Alexandra Kyle), the leader of the Six Chicks, the ultra cool snobbish girls that Jenna desperately wants to join even though her best friend and neighbor Matt Flamhaff (Jack Salvatore Jr.) points out that would be mathematically impossible.  Totally embarrassed Jenna snaps at Matt, makes her wish, and has it fulfilled by virtue of magic dust (What?  You wanted hard science on how this happens?).The next Jenna knows it is seventeen years later and she has, apparently, everything she ever wished for (breasts) and more (a job as an editor for &quot;Poise&quot; magazine).  Her best friend is Lucy (Judy Greer), who turns out to not only be Tom Tom grown up but another editor at the same magazine.  Jenna immediately tracks down Matt (Mark Ruffalo), who is also all grown up, except he remembers everything that happened since the last time they spoke: the day of her 13th birthday party.  At that point we know that two things are going happen.  First, despite having the knowledge and experience of a 13 year old Jenna is going to be a success at her job.  Second, despite having the knowledge and experience of a 13 year old Jenna is going to end up making out with Matt (but not the naked guy in her apartment).Yes, we have seen the idea of a kid in an adult's body from the original &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; to &quot;Big&quot; to the recent &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; and a dozen other movies in between.  The lack of originality does not bother me with &quot;13 Going on 30,&quot; but the lack of creativity with this script does.  Excuse me while I rant for a while, because I really wanted to enjoy this movie.First, Jenna was out of date by the time she was 13 back in 1987.  &quot;Thriller&quot; came out in 1982 and five years later young Jenna is making sure she has all of Michael Jackson's zombie moves down on the dance floor (you have to admit that this movie takes spontaneous group participation to a new level: instead of everyone bursting into a well known song this time around it is doing all the dance moves from a music video that is twenty years old).  Rick Springfield's big hit, &quot;Jessie's Girl&quot; was a hit way back in 1981, while Pat Benatar's &quot;Love is a Battlefield&quot; was big in 1983 (Note: Sometimes I tell viewers to be sure and watch the end credits; this time I am telling you to stay and LISTEN to the entire end credits).  They make such a point of Jenna being 30 in the year 2004 that it makes tying the starting point to 1987 problematic.  Gee, do you think that maybe this script was written four or five years ago?Second, leaping forward 17 years into the future presents Jenna with only one point of confusion: her cell phone.  She has no problem walking in high heels, no other technological problems confront her, Eminem is the only new name she is confronted with, and if you really want to pick nits she never notices that the World Trade Center is missing.  Okay, that is really quibbling, but they really should have been able to come up with some creative ways of her dealing with the brave new world in which she finds herself.Third, Jenna only succeeds in her job because the screenwriters wrote a scene in which everybody acts like she succeeded in doing her job.  I thought the joke of &quot;Magazine Publishing for Dummies&quot; was good (I looked, Amazon does not sell the book), but that is still a kid's mind in that gorgeous body.  Jenna needed to come up with a great idea and she did not even come up with a good idea.  Meanwhile &quot;Poise&quot; has been scooped six months in a row by a rival magazine and the board is just starting to become concerned (when Bruce Springsteen showed up on the cover of both &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; that was a bigger story that this).  If I could talk about how that subplot plays out I could double the length of this rant with all the holes in that one.What holds &quot;13 Going On 30&quot; together is Garner's performance, which is far better than this script deserves.  In a film like this there is always a moment when the main character has the chance to put things to right.  When we get to that moment in this film it is disappointing because they should have been able to come up with something better.  But then, we never really understood everything that happened to turn Jenna into a big success after her 13th birthday so we cannot expect the film to really connect the dots at the end either.  The result is an unsatisfying film that fortunately will not start Jennifer Garner's rising star one whit.  In fact, she is going to pick up momentum off of this one, she shines that much.",4,Jennifer Garner's performance survives a pretty bad script,1082851200,"04 25, 2004",2004,5237,"['quot', '13',

Do not, however, see this film unless you are ready to suspend disbelief. After all, the premise of this film is that a distressed thirteen year old girl suddenly finds herself propelled into the future and into the body of her thirty year old self.Jenna Rink is a typical teenager, a little gawky, a little insecure. She pals around with her uncool best friend, Matt Flamhaff, but, at the same time, is trying to make it into the cool six chicks clique at her school, a nasty little group of teenage hotties who use Jenna for what they can get from her. They agree to come to her thirteenth birthday party, if she will do a class report for their leader. She agrees.Matt is the first guest to arrive, and he gives her a little, doll sized dream house that he has made for her, replete with magic dust. When the other guests arrive, they soon depart with the needed report in hand, after playing a very mean trick on Jenna and leaving her desolate. A set of circumstances causes the magic dust to fall upon Jenna, just as she makes a wish that finds hers transported into the future and into the body of her thirty year old self.Jenna discovers that she now has every thing for which she had dreamed when she was thirteen. She also discovers how she has changed, and it is not a change for the better. She turns to Matt, whose friendship, she is shocked to find, has been lost somewhere along the way. Jenna then sets about putting to right what went wrong. Of course, there are any number of humorous incidents that arise out Jenna's current situation.Jennifer Garner is sensational as a thirteen year old girl trapped in the body of a thirty year old woman. She infuses the role with just the right amount of innocence and joyous abandonment that teenagers often exude. Kittenish and coltish all at once, her charm is infectious. Mark Ruffalo is perfectly cast as the grown-up Matt. He exudes sensitivity and niceness, all rolled into one very compelling package. One cannot help but like both characters tremendously.This is an entertaining film for those who enjoy light-hearted fantasy films. This film has been compared to the film, ""Big"", and while there are some similarities between the two, this film stands on its own two feet and deserves its own accolades.

So it's not easy to find one that is lighthearted and fun that I haven't watched about 50 times already.Imagine my surprise when I ran across this charmer about a nerdy girl [ Jennifer Garner] who wishes to skip her teen angst years and become fabulous and thirty instantaneously. A sprinkle of magic dust does the job, and waking up one morning, she finds herself having everything she dreamed of - a lovely apartment in Manhattan, a job in the magazine she adored as a girl, a hunky boyfriend and a stuffed full of goodies walk in closet.Sadly, however, she is shocked to discover she is not a very nice person. Putting the wisdom, idealism and enthusiasm of her unspoiled inner thirteen year old to good use,  she rectifies the situation with the help of her  best childhood friend [ Mark Ruffalao ], reconnecting with her parents, and finding true love along the way.

What's special about it is its really fine acting, its excellent sense of comedy and, most of all, its positive message.  It starts out with a 13-year old girl who wants to be popular.  She's had a cruel joke played on her and she takes it out on her male friend who adores her.  She wishes she were ""30 and flirty"" just like the women in the fashion magazines.  And with some incredible ""wishing dust"" - there she is.Flash forward 17 years.  Now, our heroine, played by Jennifer Garner, is 30.  By some magic formula that only Hollywood can understand, she has forgotten the past 17 years and is, in fact, a child in an adult's body.  Not only that, but she has an important job at the very fashion magazine that fired her imagination when she was 13.  And her co-worker and rival is the very same nasty girl who created havoc for her as a teenager.With the help of her overweight and motherly secretary (who is a fine character actress but whose name is not even listed in the credits), she looks up her old guy-pal who she treated so badly so many years ago, played by Mark Ruffalo.  He's now a photographer and also engaged to be married. Naturally, the plot thickens.The film moves at a rather frantic pace and I found myself laughing out loud.  How it all turns out is predictable but charming.  And the message is that past mistakes can be corrected and everyone can live happily ever after.

Yes, this is another one of those body switch movies (think ""Big,"" ""Vice Versa,"" ""Freaky Friday,"" etc.) in which a child magically occupies an adult body and wonders what to do with the situation. The director, Gary Winick, came out of Sundance with ""Tadpole,"" a well-meaning but overrated film in which a 16-year-old boy is seduced by a 40-year-old woman, and some of us wondered how well that plot would have worked with a 16-year-old girl and a 40-year-old man. Could it even have gotten made, let alone Tadpole's PG-13 rating? Well, now Winick finds out, by supplying a 13-year-old girl with a 30-year-old body and a boyfriend who's a professional hockey star. Their make-out scene is funny yet disturbing. And the film did manage a PG-13. But is it technically statutory rape when the 13 year old occupies a 30 year old body? Hmmm.The plot of the film isn't anything special. Hell, it's been done countless times before, and I rolled my eyes at the beginning of the trailer, but then, my curiosity got the better of me and I am glad it did. The plot has never been executed in such a charming way as this (perhaps only in the Freaky Friday remake). Thanks in part to director Wick, and to Mark Ruffalo, the film has an independent feel that is very beneficial and greatly enhances the story. A few minor plot holes and rushed ending don't hurt it as much as it would hurt other films. I hate to say this but that has a lot to do with Garner, who is terrific in her role. I was surprised to see the King of Independent films, Mark Ruffalo, in this, but he was absolutely perfect. This movie made me realize why I love him so much as an actor. The underrated and unappreciated Judy Greer is also in the mix. Her role is a tough one to explain, but she is as fantastic as in her first starring role in Jawbreaker. (She was also the ONLY redeeming quality in the awful The Village).Effortless and adorable, 30 is a lovable New York romance with the right amount of whimsy and magic.

It makes me feel a little old when I look back and realize that Big is 16 years old. 13 Going on 30 is a great movie and really is as good if not better than Big.Jenna Rink is 13 and can't grow old fast enough. She is having her birthday party and the only real friend she has is her chubby next door neighbor Matt. Jenna invites some of the popular girls from her school to her birthday party and things go bad. She's upset and makes a wish to be 30.Her wish comes true because of her friend Matt. Before the other kids got there some wishing dust was put on a present from him. While she is in her closet crying some of the wishing dust falls on her and what do you know, it works.She then wakes up in a house she's never seen. Her wish has come true, but she is 13 year old Jenna in 30 Jenna's body. She has no idea whats going on. It ends up she's one of the big shots at her favorite magazine Poise. Everything seems to be going well for her until she finds out nobody really likes her. Jenna(Garner) is upset by all this and gets her help from her former childhood friend Matt(Ruffalo). Jenna must now discover if being 30 is all that it is built up to be while changing herself and making people like her again, especially the guy shes in love wiht Matt.Jennifer Garner is absolutely wonderful in this movie. This is the first staring role for the actress in which she is the only big name actor. She really shines in her role as Jenna Rink. Tom Hanks was so good in Big because of all the energy he put into the film and Jennifer does just that. She is totally believable as a 13 year old mind in a  30 year old body. I really hope she gets a golden globe nomination for best actress in a comedy, because her performance is outstanding. She is beautiful, innocent, and hilarious in this movie.Mark Ruffalo is great as Matt Flamhoff. This is the first movie I've seen this guy in, and I was impressed. He kind of reminds me of Benjamin Bratt. He really does shine in the movie and he holds his own with against Garner. Is character is loveable in the movie as he helps Jenna out.I loved it in the movie when they dance to Michael Jackson's Thriller. Garner is great in this part of the movie. It was a lot of fun seeing people dance to that song again. It's funny how everybody remembers a song and dance that would be almost 20 years old, but who cares it's funny.I love the scenes in the movie in which Garner is hanging out with the 13 year old girls in the apartment. When they have there sleep over it's great. They tell cheesy little love stories and then dance around to Pat Benatar's Love is a Battlefield. It's a beautiful scenen.The two stars in the movie really shine. Chemistry is there between Mark and Jennifer and it really makes the movie work. You really do forget that the two are just playing. They actually look like they are falling for each other and credit has to be given to the acting skills of the two. But then again you'd have to wonder what kind of guy is Mark if he couldn't fall for Garner.This movie is a lot of fun. It's the most fun I've had at the box office this year. I dind't think the movie was going to be all that great, but I was surprised. People were singing all throughout the movie and at the end they clapped. It's a lot of fun and is a great family film.

168479,A152C8GYY25HAH,1404918051,Matthew Horner,"[2, 3]","I try to be unbiased when reviewing movies. When I watched ""13 Going on 30"", I tried to avoid obvious comparisons to 1988's ""Big"". Both movies are about an adolescent who wakes up suddenly being years older. So what? There are only so many stories out there. And, ""Big"" is about a guy, while ""13 Going on Thirty"" is about a girl. It's a given that women are more accepting of ""Guy things"" than men are about ""Girl things"".  Thus, the derisive term `chick flick'. [The idea of a `guy flick' is socially okay.] It occurs to me that Hollywood has a harder time of making a movie that appeals to women that it does to men. The era of women picking what movie to see is long gone.The truth is that ""13 Going on 30"" is not a very good movie. It has a few brilliant moments, but it bypasses some really interesting themes to settle on a very predictable love story between the two main characters.The story starts with a nerdy girl looking forward to her thirteenth birthday party. The equally nerdy boy next door is there to help her. The `cool' teens she invites conspire to ruin her big event. Crushed, our heroine [Jennifer Garner] wakes up to find herself 30 years old, just as she had `wished' she could be. She discovers that she is an editor at a trendy fashion/style magazine in Manhattan. The boy next door is now a photographer, while her childhood nemesis [the one who ruined the party] is a co-worker and rival.Ms. Garner, who also stars in the hit TV series, ""Alias"", is the main reason to see the movie. She is bright, funny, likeable and attractive. She is the driving force in all the memorable scenes. In the old days of Hollywood, she would have been groomed as a star, ala Carole Lombard, Doris Day or Rosalind Russell. In today's world, she is an actress who takes a movie role or two in her `summer vacation' from her TV work.

168480,APOUYO1BEPK22,1404918051,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[1, 1]","Oh those RomComs...how I secretly adore them. Well... maybe not so secretly.In '13 going on 30', Jennifer Garner plays Jenna, a 13 year old girl stuck in a 30 year old body. When Jenna was 13, she made a wish to be `thirty and flirty' since she just saw that statement on her favorite magazine `Poise'. With a little help of some magic dust her friend Matt got her for her 13th birthday, her wish comes true and she's now a 30 year old woman. And it's not like it was in `BIG' with Tom Hanks. He was older the next day. She is actually older, 17 years later.Within those 17 years, she's made a lot of money doing the job she loves, and she's lost a lot of friends, and has become, well, just a very bad person.  And this is what I really enjoyed about the movie. Unlike `BIG', we get to see how her life has become and we get to enjoy seeing the surprise with her. Watching the mostly sweet 13 year old Jenna see how mean she has become was fun to watch. Also it was a lot of fun to see how people reacted to her now that she was this new nice girl. Also seeing a grown woman acting like she was 13 was pretty funny also. I actually enjoyed the scenes where she was drinking the non-virgin pina coladas. When she took out the piece of fruit and dropped it (and it landing into someone else's drink a floor below) actually made me laugh out loud.Another thing that made me really like the movie was the 80's references. I love me some 80's. So when the movie starts off and has all  the 80's music going with the old videos playing (like Rick Springfield's `Jessie's Girl'), I was having a good time. Also later at a party, Jenna starts a `Thriller' dance, and though it was awkward at first, it was still kind of fun to watch. And it sounded pretty good on the hard floor they were on.The only real bad thing I would say with '13 going on 30' is that you have to throw the word `believable' out the door once you start watching it. There are many things in the movie that really shouldn't make since or should really be weird. Once she's in the future, in my opinion, she should remember everything since she's the same person. It's not like `Back to the Future' where there are two Marty McFly's. She's the one and only Jenna, but she doesn't. Also when she gets kissed by older guys, it's kinda gross if you think about it. Cause she's 13 ya know. Kinda icky, but I just don't think about it like that.In the end, I would say definitely watch this movie if you like the RomComs and you haven't seen it. Guys, it's funny. Girls, it's sweet.P.S. - In the 80's I was in single digits, but I loved Michael Jackson. He was the man back then. When `Thriller' came out it was the first tape (I had the record to) I owned. I remember moon walking (at least my version of it) in my red Michael Jackson jacket with zippers all over it, blue jeans, and cowboy boots.

I really don't expect much from 'these kinds' of movies, so occasionally one of them does take me by surprise by being fantastic (i.e. - Freaky Friday last year, which would have made my Top 10 list had I not seen it so late). 13 Going on 30 gets really close to ""fantastic"" in quite a few moments, but has enough uneven little slips of narrative to put it in ""cute"" category. But let's get this straight - it's cute as hell, and enjoyable too. I'm not going to sit and rehash the plot because just about everyone knows that it's loosely based on the concept of Big - but the movie takes an added step in a great direction by forming that setup into an often intelligent meditation on those moments in life that everyone wishes to ""redo.""Jennifer Garner is cloying in the movie's opening stretch, but then settles perfectly into the role of Jenna, a 13-year-old girl who wishes to be 30 and then magically zooms ahead 17 years. Mark Ruffalo is great as usual in the role of Matt, a former childhood pal who resurfaces after all those years. I want to sit and nitpick on a few moments of the movie that had me rolling the eyes and I want to say that there's better stuff out there right now, so don't waste your time...but 30 really pulls out the stops and makes it totally worth it in the end. You don't have to be a 14 year old teeny-bopper to enjoy this movie either - anyone can identify with that age-old sting of regret.

Did you have to stuff your bra? Did you have a ruffled skirt, and wore massive scrunchies in your hair? Did you want to be in with the popular crowd, but knew you couldn't stand a chance? Did you have a best male friend, who secretly fancied you?OK, I didn't have the latter, but the rest was/is me! That's one of the reasons this film struck a chord with me. I was the young Jenna in this movie. But I'm 10 years off 30, and have no plans of getting there anytime soon!Jennifer Garner in the movie is wonderfully dorky, awkward, but so great! She plays the part brilliantly, and still manages the guy - despite managing to chat up a thirteen year old halfway through.There are a few minor problems with this otherwise great movie. Jenna is 30 in 2004 - so when she was 13 would have been 1988? Yet the most popular tracks for the movie (Pat Benatar's &quot;Love is a Battlefield&quot; and Michael Jackson's &quot;Thriller&quot;) are both from 1983, five years before. Someone didn't do the research on popular music from 1988. The tracks they could have had in the movie could have been George Michael's &quot;Faith&quot;, Tracey Chapman's &quot;Fast Car&quot;, INXs' &quot;New Sensation&quot; and heaven forbid we remind everyone who grew up in the 80s, Debbie Gibson.The scene where they all dance to &quot;Thriller&quot; looks a bit awkward at times (Jennifer Garner's smile sometimes seems rather fake, as it doesn't reach her eyes) but was pure class - even though NO ONE would dare admit to knowing the moves. (I don't even remember the song)Mark Ruffalo was fantastic as the best male friend that had such an obvious crush on Jenna, but she was too blind to see it. And instead fancies the most popular guy in school (isn't that how it always works?) who later turns out to be a fat, balding, taxi driver.The movie has a very sad ending (albeit happy), so bring out the tissues! It's a great movie overall, Jennifer Garner is pure genius as the female 'Big', and the overall awkwardness of her is well done.

Sure 13 GOING ON 30 may be the distaff side of Tom Hanks' biggie, but on its own, it's an enjoyable, well done and involving comedy.  It's fun to watch; Jennifer Garner is marvelous as its heroine, and underrated Mark Ruffalo is just right as the cast off boyfriend who finds out the torch is still lit.  While using the magic dust as an incredible device, we still enjoy watching Garner as she has to adapt her 13 year old mind to the 30 year old she has become.  Garner demonstrates a keen understanding of this and does extremely well in being both the teenager and the grown up girl who got what she wished for, but at what expense?  the 80s soundtrack is great, and I had a good time watching the dancing to THRILLER.  I never liked the song that much but the way it is used in this movie, along with another classic LOVE IS A BATTLEFIELD, is brilliant.

She is one of the most attractive actresses around.  And after seeing this movie, I can say that she is also an incredible actress.  She may be best known for her role in Alias, and maybe to a lesser degree as Elektra, but she pulls off the sweet, innocent Jenna Rink flawlessly.The movie, as it has been compared many times, is like a female version of Big.  The big difference, though, is that not only does Jenna jump 17 years in age, everyone does.  She wishes to be 30, gets sprinkled by some wishing dust, and wakes up 17 years later.Her struggle to figure out what is going on is quite amusing.  Her struggle with finding out that she's not a very nice person is touching.  She is particularly moving in a scene where she asks her former best friend what happened between them.Mark Ruffalo plays the adult version of her best friend, Matt.  He also shines.  He has a very easy way of acting that really makes you believe.  The chemistry between Garner and Ruffalo is great, and you truly feel for their characters Jenna and Matt.Sure, 13 Going on 30 is a chick flick, but it's also a great date movie.

But nothing prepares her for waking up one morning to find that her dream has come true. She stumbles out of bed only to find that she is in a strange house, and there's a naked man in her shower! Once Jenna manages to pull herself together, she sets out to discover just what's happened to her in the last 17 years, of which she has no recollection. She looks up her best friend from childhood, Matty (Mark Ruffalo), in hopes that he'll be able to help fill in the gaps. What she finds out, though, is that maybe, despite the fact that she's achieved all her childhood dreams, she's actually lost more than she's gained.Now, the basic theme of the movie has obviously been used before - someone wishes they could jump to a different time in their life (either forward or backward depending on their goals), only to discover that once they achieve this, it's not quite all they had hoped for and they'd like nothing better than to just go back to the way things were before. But the plot is given several fun twists that keep it from feeling hackneyed. The '80s theme throughout the movie is a delightful touch, and Jennifer Garner's comedic timing is perfect, providing us with tons of genuinely funny laughs. Some moments had the whole theater in stitches! We also see Jenna discover some truths about herself and undergo transformations that are touching. The overall moral message is that true friendship is more important, and has more long-term rewards, than high school popularity.All the actors did fantastic jobs. Jennifer Garner makes Jenna's character both touching and funny, and Mark Ruffalo is incredibly sweet and charismatic. The chemistry between the two is great. The show, however, is often stolen by the brilliant performance of Andy Serkis, who plays the adult Jenna's stuffy but loveable boss. You may know Serkis as the actor who provided Gollum's voice and actions in ""The Lord of the Rings,"" and it's great to see him here in a more visible role.

On her 13th birthday she managed to get the ""popular girls"" at school (and of course they were mean) to come to her birthday party and she choose them over her best friend Matt.  After making a wish with the ""magical wishing dust"" Matt gave her for her birthday Jenna wakes up 17 years later, ""30, flirty and thriving.""  As Jenna adjusts to her new world she learns that growing up to have everything she wanted isn't all it's cracked up to be as she finds that while clawing her way to the top she in fact lost everything that really matters to her in life.THE COOL STUFFOverall, the ""life lessons"" Jenna learns are some pretty darn valuable and deep stuff so kudos to the writers for writing out a deep but yet funny story.  Jennifer Garner's portrayal of a 13 year-old trapped in a 30 year-old body was just AWESOME as she had all the ""little"" things down pat from facials to movements.

Especially when we get everything we think we wanted...at least, when we were 13 and not thinking things through very clearly.  Do we compromise, become vacant and materialistic, do dirty deeds to get ahead? Some of us do.  And in the end no one's ever very happy deep inside when they do it.  The key? To go back to how we felt when we were kids and we knew more clearly the difference between good and bad, before the lines blurred.  We knew what made us happy, what made us feel good, what was right in the world.  The key is to carry that joy with us throughout our lives.  That's the message of this film, and the message comes home.Jennifer Garner is a total delight in this film.  I think that's because she has the fire and spirit and silliness inside of her to carry it off.  There are so many times when I feel that she really IS 13, or a pretty close proximity.  She absolutely glows at times, and there's no affectation there---she's utterly sincere.

It is, as you probably know, about a 13-year-old who wishes to be 30 and suddenly is.  When she ""becomes 30"", however, she retains the innocence, naivitee and sweetness she had as young teenager, which makes the film really interesting.  The 30-year-old person she had grown to be was sophisticated, jaded, and not a nice person; when she takes over this person's life and body, though, she is the opposite, surprising many people in her life.If you are 30 or over, it makes you think about your life, your choices, and how you, too have changed from the person you were at 13; also, what sense of enthusiasm, wonder, and value you may have lost as you aged.  If you are under 30, it makes you think about growing up, and what you want to be like as a true adult.This movie is a great choice, and I think would be good for teens too.  It would probably not be quite as enjoyable for men and boys, unless they enjoy watching entertaining ""chick flicks"" with their significant other.Jennifer Garner did a great acting job in this.

It has some plot similarities to ""Big"" the Tom Hanks movie about the boy who wishes to become an adult and, through improbable means, gets his wish.Jenna Rink is a 13 year old girl who is heavily influenced by the fashion culture and she wants to be in with the in crowd girls who are great looking and have great looking boyfriends.  When Jenna bargains to get these cool kids to come to a party at her house, they pull a cruel trick on her.  She blames it on Matt, her un-hip but sincere guy friend and blows him off.  Then she wishes to be ""thirty, flirty, and successful"" while magic dust that happens to be present, falls on her.Next thing Jenna remembers, she falls out of bed and is in an apartment and sees a naked man getting out of the shower and addressing her in terms of endearment.  She also has about a hundred shoes and an array of makeup.  Over time, Jenna figures out what happened.  She has time-traveled to a later point in her life with no memory of what happened in between.Jenna becomes aware that she is at age 30 in the year 2004 (when this movie came out) the editor of one of those fashion magazines that shaped her values as a teenager.  She also has an attractive boyfriend, the aforementioned naked man in her apartment.  Jenna is successful in the way she defined success.  What Jenna finds out about the course of her life in many instances makes her feel ashamed.  She has done several unethical things in running the magazine.  Also, her friendship with Matt dissolved a long time ago and worse, he is about to marry someone else.Jenna realizes that the editors at her fashion magazine don't have a clue about real friends and real fun.  Jenna's magazine, Poise, as well as its competitor Sparkle are obviously based on Glamour and Cosmopolitan and in some cases the movies may be ridiculing them.The movie opens with Jenna being 13 in 1987 and includes popular culture from that era.  Some of the songs featured, however, were from the early 1980's, were out of style by 1987 and had not yet achieved nostalgic value.Despite being a chick flick, this movie will make you think.",4,"The female version of ""Big""",1192924800,"10 21, 2007",2007,2194,"['delightful', 'movie', 'strong', 'messages', 'what', 'important', 'life', 'plot', 'similarities', 'Big', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'movie', 'boy', 'who', 'become', 'adult', 'improbable', 'means', 'wish.Jenna', 'Rink', '13', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'fashion', 'culture', 'be', 'crowd', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'great', 'looking', 'have', 'great', 'looking', 'boyfriends', 'When', 'Jenna', 'get', 'cool', 'kids', 'come', 'party', 'house', 'pull', 'cruel', 'trick', 'Matt', 'un-hip', 'sincere', 'guy', 'friend', 'off', 'Then', 'be', 'thirty', 'flirty', 'successful', 'magic', 'dust', 'be', 'present', 'her.Next', 'thing', 'Jenna', 'remembers', 'bed', 'apartment', 'naked', 'man', 'getting', 'shower', 'addressing', 'terms', 'endearment', 'also', 'hundred', 'shoes', 'array', 'makeup', 'time', 'Jenna', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'time-traveled', 'later', 'point', 'life', 'memory', 'what', 'happened', 'between.Jenna', 'becomes', 'aware', 'age', '30', 'year', '2004', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'editor', 'one', 'fashion', 'magazines', 'shaped', 'values', 'teenager', 'also', 'attractive', 'boyfriend', 'aforementioned', 'naked', 'man', 'apartment', 'Jenna', 'successful', 'way', 'defined', 'success', 'What', 'Jenna', 'out', 'course', 'life', 'many', 'instances', 'feel', 'ashamed', 'done', 'several', 'unethical', 'things', 'running', 'magazine', 'Also', 'friendship', 'Matt', 'dissolved', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'worse', 'marry', 'someone', 'else.Jenna', 'editors', 'fashion', 'magazine', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'real', 'friends', 'real', 'fun', 'Jenna', 'magazine', 'Poise', 'as', 'well', 'competitor', 'Sparkle', 'are', 'obviously', 'based', 'Glamour', 'Cosmopolitan', 'cases', 'movies', 'may', 'be', 'ridiculing', 'them.The', 'movie', 'Jenna', 'being', '13', '1987', 'popular', 'culture', 'era', 'songs', 'featured', 'however', 'were', 'early', '1980', 'were', 'style', '1987', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'achieved', 'nostalgic', 'value.Despite', 'being', 'chick', 'flick', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'think']",N/A

But then one of the girls (Jenna) suddenly became a grown-up 30 year old woman.Then the movie became meaningful, because it depicts a job situation in a magazine,so I could somewhat relate to it.In her life as a grown-up, Jenna is a magazine editor in Poise magazine.She struggles in this unfamiliar situation and still behaves like a little girl.For example, in a bar she picks up a little boy instead of a man who is at her age.She keeps wanting to play children's games...But then she meets a former school boyfriend and things become more normal.I really like this movie. It is funny, relaxing, it gives you the chance to have a lookat the business world in New York. It is something like the ""Working girl"" movie,if you have seen it - it's about competition between companies, etc.And the women are so beautiful.

Hardy,"[4, 6]","Jennifer Garner is not my favorite actor her being new to me and the simple fact that they choose her to be Elektra (which in all honesty doesn't suit her nor does she do justice to that particular Marvel Comic character. Her and Ben Afleck); I don't think she's beautiful, hot, or sexy, probably just bearable to look at, but she's not ugly either just average looking. So you can tell when I purchased 13 going on 30 I wasn't expecting much but to my great surprise this movie was everything I never thought it would be and more!It was light hearted and genuinely funny. Jennifer Garner portrayed the personality of a 13-year-old girl of the 80s' perfectly it was almost hard to believe she wasn't 13 (then again, those are actors for you). The story is much like Tom Hank's movie ""Big"" only with a more feminine edge to it.12-year-old Jenna wants so badly to be apart of a group of girls (six of them) and would practically blow of her best friend Mark just to join them, however when she is humiliated on her 13th birthday by these girls and their friends Jenna wishes for nothing but to be 30, flirty and successful. Unbeknownst to the young girl actually gets her wish. And thus a 30-year-old Jenna finds herself inside an apartment with a man she's never recognized and a life she never expected she would have.I Practically laughed aloud when her friend said ""Do you wan to go to jail, I meant him!"" And Jenna replies ""That guy, (scoffs) oh gross!"" Hilarious! However, the movie (like most comedies) has its hints drama. When Jenna hits an unexpected bump in the road she finds things are going downhill in her life and heads back to her old home to get her feet back on the ground. Jenna finally begins to Realize being 30 isn't what's its cracked up to be.The movie in all is a great wonder to behold all on its' own, I loved the fact that it featured music that my mother would listen to (excluding Pat Benatar(sp?) and the newcomer that sings ""Why can't I?"") and that it focused more on friendship before getting to the romance. This movie is for anyone looking for a major relief from all the movies seeking awards and B-movies alike. Trust me its a funny movie. [---a 5 out of 5]",5,Brings out the inner child!

168517,A16QODENBJVUI1,1404918051,Robert Moore,"[21, 25]","Shakespearean actor Sir Donald Wolfit famously quipped, ""Dying is easy; comedy is hard.""  Jennifer Garner has enjoyed phenomenal success starring as Sydney Bristow is the superb action series ALIAS, but comedy acting is much more difficult than performing an action role.  The question with this film was whether Ms. Garner was going to be able to make the transition to comedy.  The verdict?  Quite well.  I don't want her to quit ALIAS, but I hope she takes another stab at comedy at some future point in her career.The movie is basically BIG meets A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  A thirteen-old-girl, who like all teens yearns desperately for a host of things that seem important at the time.  After a particularly humiliating birthday party, she yearns to be thirty, and she gets her wish.  Jennifer Garner does a fine job of playing a thirteen-year-old girl trapped in a thirty-year-old's body.  She suffers by comparison with the extraordinary performance by Tom Hanks in BIG, but who wouldn't (I'm not aware of any comic actor ever who would have been more delightful in that role than Hanks).  But as the film goes along, it transforms from a female version of BIG to A CHRISTMAS CAROL, with Garner's character Jenna learning what a terrible person she has become, cut off from her parents, without having talked to her male best friend in seventeen years, ruthlessly stealing ideas from other people in her job, cheating on her boyfriend, sharing company secrets with another company, and just generally living a pretty rotten life.  Of course, we all know from the first seconds of the film that Jenna will get to go back and do her life over, getting it right this time.There are a few scenes that are a bit too precious that I think could have been dispensed with, such as thirty-year-old Jenna giggling with a bunch of young teenaged girls, telling them about her kissing a guy.  But there were also a lot of fun scenes, and if as a whole it stretches credulity, this can be forgiven because the movie never pretends to be anything other than a fun time.  I especially enjoyed some of the scenes were grown up Jenna gets incredibly embarrassed by grown up behavior, such as when her self-absorbed hockey-playing boyfriend does a strip tease for her.I enjoyed Mark Ruffalo as Jenna's thirteen-year-old male friend all grown up, and it was fun to see Andy Serkis in a role without CGI masking him (he memorably played Gollum in THE LORD OF THE RINGS) playing Jenna's boss.

It was so much more than I had expected and so much better too!Impatient to grow up in 1987, 13 year old Jenna Rink (Jennifer Garner) ultimately gets her wish. She then wakes up to discover that she is THE Jenna Rink---rich and connected magazine editor of 'Poise' magazine.In addition to being the same magazine that she had poured over as a kid, Jenna goes wild to learn that she is personal friend with Madonna of all people and owns a super cool loft packed with awesome clothes and has a very hunky professional athlete boyfriend! She's convinced that life cannot get any better.Upon further examination however, Jenna discovers material riches don't cover for emotional absence. Her successes came at the cost of abandoning family and friends The people who are around Jenna regularly tell her what they think she wants to hear and aren't actually her friends.Garner does a good job with the scripting material that she had to work with--the scripting holes are not her own fault. However, people at the magazine...etc don't seem to question why this allegedly high-powered and together power player is suddenly so spacey. If New York's publishing environment remains very cutthroat and the fictional magazine in this film was well-established, the company should have noticed something.The most solid character is the 'adult' Matt Flamhaff  (Mark Ruffalo) Jenna's childhood friend who is no where near as financially rich, but is emotionally happier having never forgot who he was or what he believed in.According to the film back story, Matt and Jenna had been friends, but drifted away.

168519,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,1404918051,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 4]","***1/2It's 1987 and Jenna Rink is a pubescent teen deeply unhappy with the state of her life.  Unable to fit in with the ""in"" crowd, Jenna makes an idle wish on her 13th birthday that she could instead be a 30-year old woman already living the life of glamour and independence she feels she so richly deserves.  Through some magical fluke, she achieves her wish, waking up in 2004 in the grown-up body of a successful fashion magazine editor.  The problem is that she is unable to remember the seventeen years that have elapsed since Madonna was in vogue and the hip kids were still strutting their stuff to the heavy dance floor beat of Michael Jackson's Thriller.  As a result, Jenna has to spend a large part of the movie trying to piece together the events that have brought her to where she is today.""13 Going on 30"" is one of those high-concept romantic comedies that succeeds or fails based on its ability to transcend the confines and restrictions of its particular gimmick.  Happily, this movie is quite effective at doing just that.  Although the screenplay touches on the expected conflicts Jenna has coming to terms with a world filled with unfamiliar devices such as cell phones, it also explores the more personal aspects of how a 13 year-old would deal with the grown up issues of dating and sex.  In addition, Jenna also has to contend with the fact that she doesn't really much like the kind of person she's become - a conniving, status-seeking, career-drive snob - and looks for ways to turn back the clock and make amends for her actions.Jennifer Garner sparkles as the older Jenna, and Mark Ruffalo is, as always, compelling and charming as the sensitive boyhood chum whose love for Jenna has never faded.  They alone make the occasional plot hole and narrative contrivance forgivable.  The film also boasts a soundtrack chock full of nifty '80's songs, every other one of which seems to feature Belinda Carlisle in the lead vocal.

Movies like that don't come around that often, but 13 Going on 30 has joined that group.I am not going to dwell on the fact that this is essentially the same plot as Big. I don't see what the big deal is. Look at teen horror movies. Although I find most of them entertaining, they are pretty much the same basic plot over and over. Why should Big and this movie be endlessly compared?Jennifer Garner does a fantastic job. I have been a fan of hers ever since Alias first came on, and I am glad to see her pull off comedy so well. She is such a great comedic actress and I hope she does more movies like this in the future. Anyone who thinks she doesn't have range should watch this movie because she can pull off ANY genre.The supporting cast is also very good. Mark Ruffalo does a very good job. I had never seen him in anything before but I can see why he gets a lot of attention. Judy Greer is very good as Jenna's ""friend."" She is a good little villain.I think this movie is very relatable. You don't have to be a girl to relate to this movie. Who hasn't felt unpopular, had one of their friends stab them in the back, or wanted to go back to a time in your life when things weren't so complicated? It's relatable elements like that that make this a movie you can watch over and over again.I absolutely LOVE the soundtrack for this movie. I love all the 80s songs in it and they form the basis for many of the movie's most memorable scenes. I also like the modern day songs too. They did a really good job of finding the right music to fit the scenes.I love this movie and highly recommend it. I never get tired of it because it is such a well made movie.

168529,AQM2ADBR0TYSO,1404918051,Sarah Schenkkan,"[1, 1]","""13 Going On 30"" follows the story of Jenna Rink, a gawky thirteen year old who desperately wants to fit in with the popular crowd, the exclusive ""Six Chicks"". In an attempt to become their friends, despite the warnings of her geeky best friend Matt, Jenna invites the Six Chicks to her thirteenth birthday party, where they ultimately use and humiliate her. Thinking Matt is in on the joke, Jenna refuses to speak to him. Later, while crying alone in the closet, she wishes to be ""Thirty, Flirty, and Thriving"", just like the article in her favorite magazine, Poise.However, when she wakes up in the morning, she finds out she is indeed 30, and has no idea what has happened to her life since she turned thirteen 17 years ago. She is dating an immature hockey player, works alongside the former leader of the Six Chicks, has no real friends and is a cutthroat and mean executive at Poise magazine. But worst of all, she finds that she's lost contact with Matt, her one true friend of childhood. Throughout the rest of the film, Jenna tracks down Matt, and using high school yearbooks and Matt's memories, begins to figure out how she became the person that she is now, and how to reconnect with her past life.Coming off of her first movie role as Electra in ""Daredevil"", Jennifer Garner takes a quirky and entertaining role in Jenna, and plays her to perfection. She is able to communicate a 13 year old's emotions and speech, and is very funny and likeable. As Matt, Mark Ruffalo (recently seen in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"") also fits perfectly in his role. His somewhat awkward and endearing delivery and movement on the screen is refreshing to see in a romantic lead, and he is a fine contrast to Jenna's character. The supporting cast is strong, and the script is a perfect blend of humor and emotion, to satisfy every audience member.

She's living the kind of life she dreamed about as a kid, but apparantly has taken some paths to get there she wouldn't have expected: Jenna can't remember anything at all about the past 17 years.  Characters from her younger life are in different roles in her grown-up life than she would have expected as well; some that she would have thought would still be big parts of her life are absent, while people she never got along with are now her allies.Jennifer Garner should have gotten an award for this; she plays the role of a character who's thirteen and thirty simultaneously to absolute perfection, and shows a tremendous comedic flair light years ahead of many higher-profile comedy movie mainstays.  It's in the top three or four films in the 'laugh-out-loud' category of the 2000s, is a brillant romance, and is more deeply moving and affecting than the vast majority of 'serious-minded' dramas.

I expected a fluffy but crappy film but boy, I was wrong. This film is brilliantly cast and very well written. This film keeps the viewer interested and on their toes the entire time. In my opinion, this film has become a classic and is not far away from my DVD player. I really recommend this film!(May contain spoilers)Jenna Rink is a teenager who is desperate to be considered ""cool"" and to fit in. Her ultimate goal is to be accepted into the popular clique, ""The Six Chicks"" lead by snobby Tom-Tom. She has a best friend, Matt, who believes that she is totally cool in her own way. Not realizing this, she invites the Six Chicks to her 13th birthday party where she believes that she will be finally accepted into the cool crowd. At the party, the snobs trick Jenna into thinking that she will get to play ""Seven Minutes in Heaven"" with hunk Chris Grandy. They leave Jenna in the closet and Tom-Tom tells Matt that he is wanted in the closet. When they ditch the party and Jenna realizes that her fantasy will not be coming true, she uses some wishing dust to turn her into a ""thirty, flirty and thriving"" adult. Fast foward seventeen years later and Jenna finds out that she lives the high life as a magazine editor in New York City. But she soon discovers that her life is very different from the life she had in mind.She discovers that she and Matt had stopped being friends way back in high school and that she had become a member of the Six Chicks and had gotten everything that she had ever wanted. Jenna learns valuable lessons in friendship and love along the way. She discovers that her good friend Lucy (Tom-Tom) is a two faced backstabber and that her hockey star boyfriend is a sleazeball. To make matters worse, she has fallen in love with the adult Matt who happens to be engaged. Seeing her life unravel before her eyes, Jenna decides to make some changes for the better.The cast in this film is brilliant. Jennifer Garner shines as an adult Jenna. Judy Greer is hilarious as Lucy, Jenna's coworker formally known as Tom-Tom and Mark Ruffalo gives a great performance as Matt. The real star of this film is Andy Serkis who plays Jenna's gay british boss, Richard.The Special Edition DVD includes 18 deleted and extended scenes, a blooper reel, two audio commentaries from the filmmakers, ""I Was A Teenage Geek"", a featurette where the cast and crew give you some insight on their teenage selfs.

168551,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,1404918051,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","It is a pity that with rising star like Jennifer Garner '13 Going On 30' could have been a much better film. I don't care if the film is predictable. I don't care if the film is virtually a retread of superior Tom Hanks film `Big.' No, but I was hugely disappointed by the film simply because the director - whoever he is - misses every opportunity to make the heroine more interesting, more charming, and most of all, more believable.Jenna Rink, a slightly geeky 13-year-old girl living in the 80s, wakes up to find that she is now a 30 year-old woman living in the year of 2004. This is the meaning of the film's title, I think, but this is also the weakest part of it. Think about this. At the age of 30, Jenna finds that 17 years later she is the editor of one magazine Poise, she is friends with Madonna, and is living with a hunky popular professional hockey player. And she is living in New York City while her mentality remains that of 13 year old. And no one suspects the truths while watching Jenna suddenly start to act strangely (to them).OK, but you might say, how about `Big'? Yes, Tom Hanks managed to live as an adult after being turned into an innocent one. But he was working for a toy maker, if I remember correctly, and that setting sounds reasonable, and his acting is so believable (and he got an Oscar nomination.) But if you ask me to believe a 30 year-old-woman can suddenly start dancing to the Michael Jackson song `Thriller' and turn a dismally bad party floor into a great success, you are asking too much from me. You may get a few laughs seeing it, but you may also feel embarrassed seeing Jennifer Garner doing a zombie dance.I'm not complaining about her or the familiar premise of the film (of which script comes from the writer team of `What Women Want').But unlike that Mel Gibson/Helen Hunt romantic comedy, the title '13 Going On 30' is not exactly accurate. Jenna, as you see, should still remain a 13-year-old girl living in the 80s, but the same Jenna apparently has no trouble dealing with a cell phone, showing no surprise using it. But at the same time Jenna does not get the sexual nuance of her supposed boyfriend's remarks about `play the game.' I don't point out these inconsistencies one by one. In short, the film suggests she thinks like a 13-year-old girl trapped inside the body of a 30-year-old lady, but in fact she often acts like a 30-year-old woman trapped inside the body of the same age. These gaps are only damaging the film because as far as the characters go, it is the smallest details that really matter in this kind of comedy based on strange situations. Watch another body-switching film `Freaky Friday' in which everything fits in the right place and you will know what I mean.Finally about the actors. Many seem to be praising the acting of Jennifer Garner. I beg to disagree. It is Mark Ruffalo as Jenna's long-estranged love Matt who is really the best thing in this film. He represents a mature man with sound judgment and good-natured personality, and he does it without making the film too sentimental. You immediately realize that he is the man Jenna should have loved, and you understand why she is attracted to him. The only thing I cannot understand is, how come he is attracted to Jenna, whose behaviors are either childlike or childish, and always impossible..",2,Fluffy Version of 'Big' Could Have Been Better With Another Director,1133481600,"12 2, 2005",2005,3340,"['pity', 'rising', 'star', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Going', '30', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'film', 'predictable', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'film', 'virtually', 'retread', 'superior', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'film', 'Big', 'No', 'was', 'hugely', 'disappointed', 'film', 'simply', 'director', 'whoever', 'misses', 'opportunity', 'make', 'heroine', 'more', 'interesting', 'more', 'charming', 'most', 'more', 'believable.Jenna', 'Rink', 'slightly', 'geeky', '13-year-old', 'girl', 'living', '80s', 'up', 'find', 'now', '30', 'year-old', 'woman', 'living', 'year', '2004', 'meaning', 'film', 'title', 'think', 'also', 'weakest', 'part', 'Think', 'age', '30', 'Jenna', '17', 'years', 'later', 'editor', 'one', 'magazine', 'Poise', 'friends', 'Madonna', 'living', 'hunky', 'popular', 'professional', 'hockey', 'player', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'mentality', '13', 'year', 'old', 'one', 'truths', 'watching', 'Jenna', 'suddenly', 'start', 'act', 'strangely', '.OK', 'might', 'say', 'how', 'about', 'Big', 'Yes', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'managed', 'live', 'adult', 'being', 'turned', 'innocent', 'one', 'was', 'working', 'toy', 'maker', 'remember', 'correctly', 'setting', 'sounds', 'reasonable', 'acting', 'so', 'believable', 'got', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'ask', 'believe', '30', 'year-old-woman', 'can', 'suddenly', 'start', 'dancing', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'song', 'Thriller', 'turn', 'dismally', 'bad', 'party', 'floor', 'great', 'success', 'are', 'asking', 'too', 'much', 'may', 'get', 'few', 'seeing', 'may', 'also', 'feel', 'embarrassed', 'seeing', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'doing', 'zombie', 'dance.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'familiar', 'premise', 'film', 'script', 'writer', 'team', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', '.But', 'Mel', 'Gibson/Helen', 'Hunt', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'title', 'Going', '30', 'not', 'exactly', 'accurate', 'Jenna', 'see', 'should', 'still', 'remain', '13-year-old', 'girl', 'living', '80s', 'same', 'Jenna', 'apparently', 'trouble', 'dealing', 'cell', 'phone', 'showing', 'surprise', 'using', 'same', 'time', 'Jenna', 'not', 'get', 'sexual', 'nuance', 'supposed', 'boyfriend', 'remarks', 'play', 'game', 'do', ""n't"", 'point', 'out', 'inconsistencies', 'one', 'one', 'short', 'film', '13-year-old', 'girl', 'trapped', 'body', '30-year-old', 'lady', 'fact', 'often', '30-year-old', 'woman', 'trapped', 'body', 'same', 'age', 'gaps', 'are', 'only', 'damaging', 'film', 'as', 'far', 'characters', 'go', 'smallest', 'details', 'really', 'matter', 'kind', 'comedy', 'based', 'strange', 'situations', 'Watch', 'body-switching', 'film', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'everything', 'fits', 'right', 'place', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'mean.Finally', 'actors', 'Many', 'seem', 'be', 'praising', 'acting', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'beg', 'disagree', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Jenna', 'long-estranged', 'love', 'Matt', 'who', 'really', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'mature', 'man', 'sound', 'judgment', 'good-natured', 'personality', 'making', 'film', 'too', 'sentimental', 'immediately', 'realize', 'man', 'Jenna', 'should', 'have', 'loved', 'understand', 'why', 'attracted', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'come', 'attracted', 'Jenna', 'behaviors', 'are', 'childlike', 'childish', 'always', 'impossible..']",N/A

Ruffalo is a great guy, not too macho and not too pretty so he manages to come across perfectly as the best friend that waits patiently in the wings and he is adorable.This movie works for adults as well as teenagers and is a pleasant film to watch. If you know the 80's it is filled with funny nostalgia and great music. If you skipped your childhood bent on success this film will encourage you to find that playfulness and inventiveness that so many adults lack.

However, parts of it stuck in my memory and I'd catch it when it was on TV.  Finally it really grew on me and I knew I needed to own it!  Now every time I watch this movie, it just makes me enjoy it that much more.  Although it's been compared to the Tom Hanks movie ""Big,"" it takes a different perspective and has a much different outcome.  Lots of fun for us girls...guys may enjoy it for its insight into the way girls think.  And - if you grew up in the 1980s, you will get a huge kick out of reliving the music/dancing from that generation.  Watching the cast dancing to ""Thriller"" was my favorite part.

168557,AQP1VPK16SVWM,1404918051,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[16, 18]","Jennifer Garner gives a delightful, star turn performance in the comedic-fantasy ""13 Going on 30"". Jenna (Christa B. Allen) hates being a tween. When her 13th birthday rolls around, she's excited and invites her best friend Matt (Sean Marquette) as well as the girls from the most popular click at her school to her party. There's no adults allowed so, of course, it'll be the best 13th birthday bash ever. Not really. Before the party Matt gives her Jenna's dream house in miniature with figures representing Jenna, Rick Springfield and, of course, Matt. Oh, he also includes some magic dust so she can make all her dreams come true.  Lucy the ""leader"" of the click ditches her and embarrasses her. Jenna's angry and kicks Matt out of the house. As she settles into the closet where she's put her wrecked dream house, she wishes for nothing more than to be 30 not 13.The next morning Jenna (Garner) wakes up in a strange bed with a strange man. She doesn't quite understand what's happened. Yesterday, she was 13 and now she's the co-editor of  her favorite fashion magazine. It seems strange particularly when she discovers that Matt's no longer in her life and everyone generally regards her as a supreme bitch.  She's confused not sure she's happy and misses Matt (Ruffalo). She looks him up in Greenwich Village and discovers he's a talented photographer who hasn't seen her since her temper tantrum 17 years before. Gradually, she discovers what she really wants is what she has denied herself; Matt and a life where she didn't turn out to be a nasty person.Despite all the extras that crowd on to this single dual layer disc, ""13 Going on 30"" looks terrific. Overall, the picture quality is stellar and the 5.1 sound makes you want to dance along to the music from the 80's no matter how bad it really was.Boy did this girl go shopping. Included in this bag of treats from the most fashionable haunts of Hollywood are 18 deleted/extended scenes, a blooper reel, two vintage music videos that play prominent roles in the film (although Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" is missing). The two featurettes are the most fun. We get to see the stars of the film when they were 13 and get their take on how geeky they were when they were that age. It's charming and fun to see Jennifer Garner in her band uniform and Ruffalo going on about his bad fashion sense. We also get a ""Making of"" featurette which is pretty good and gives some insight into some of the complex themes buried beneath this busy comedy. The most fun, though, are the last two features. ""The 80's Outfit Challenge"" allows you to piece together the ""ultimate"" outfit based on the standards of the time. We also get ""Then and Now"" which compares current modern conveniences to their 80's counterparts. The blooper reel isn't bad but it doesn't have the bust-out-loud quality that many of these do.With two excellent commentary tracks featuring director Gary Winick and producers Susan Arnold & Donna Arkoff Roth (both the daughters of film people-Arnold is the daughter of director/producer Jack Arnold while Arkoff Roth is the daughter of z-movie king Samuel Z. Arkoff), the commentary tracks are more than a cut above the norm with fun, witty asides and interesting insights into the making of the movie, Garner's performance and other tidbits.A very funny comedy of errors, ""13"" excels primarily due to Garner and Ruffalo's strong performances and the able support of Judy Greer and Andy Serkis. Ironically, ""13"" has the same weaknesses as ""Big"" did with a story that's a little too familiar and pat in its conclusion. Still, it's a fun entertainment that will keep you chuckling.",5,Pleasing romantic comedy,1090713600,"07 25, 2004",2004,3647,"['Jennifer', 'Garner', 'delightful', 'star', 'turn', 'performance', 'comedic-fantasy', '13', 'Going', '30', 'Jenna', 'Christa', 'B.', 'Allen', 'being', 'tween', 'When', '13th', 'birthday', 'rolls', 'excited', 'best', 'friend', 'Matt', 'Sean', 'Marquette', 'as', 'well', 'girls', 'most', 'popular', 'click', 'school', 'party', 'adults', 'allowed', 'so', 'course', ""'ll"", 'be', 'best', '13th', 'birthday', 'bash', 'ever', 'Not', 'really', 'party', 'Matt', 'Jenna', 'dream', 'house', 'miniature', 'figures', 'representing', 'Jenna', 'Rick', 'Springfield', 'course', 'Matt', 'Oh', 'also', 'magic', 'dust', 'can', 'make', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'Lucy', 'leader', 'click', 'Jenna', 'angry', 'kicks', 'Matt', 'house', 'closet', 'where', 'put', 'wrecked', 'dream', 'house', 'nothing', 'more', 'be', '30', 'not', '13.The', 'next', 'morning', 'Jenna', 'Garner', 'up', 'strange', 'bed', 'strange', 'man', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'what', 'happened', 'Yesterday', 'was', '13', 'now', 'co-editor', 'favorite', 'fashion', 'magazine', 'strange', 'particularly', 'when', 'Matt', 'longer', 'life', 'everyone', 'generally', 'supreme', 'bitch', 'confused', 'not', 'sure', 'happy', 'Matt', 'Ruffalo', 'up', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'talented', 'photographer', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'temper', 'tantrum', '17', 'years', 'before', 'Gradually', 'what', 'really', 'what', 'denied', 'Matt', 'life', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'nasty', 'person.Despite', 'extras', 'crowd', 'single', 'dual', 'layer', 'disc', '13', 'Going', '30', 'terrific', 'Overall', 'picture', 'quality', 'stellar', '5.1', 'sound', 'want', 'dance', 'along', 'music', '80', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'really', 'did', 'girl', 'go', 'shopping', 'Included', 'bag', 'treats', 'most', 'fashionable', 'haunts', 'Hollywood', 'are', '18', 'deleted/extended', 'scenes', 'blooper', 'reel', 'two', 'vintage', 'music', 'videos', 'play', 'prominent', 'roles', 'film', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Thriller', 'missing', 'two', 'featurettes', 'are', 'most', 'fun', 'get', 'see', 'stars', 'film', 'when', 'were', '13', 'get', 'take', 'how', 'geeky', 'were', 'when', 'were', 'age', 'charming', 'fun', 'see', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'band', 'uniform', 'Ruffalo', 'going', 'bad', 'fashion', 'sense', 'also', 'get', 'Making', 'featurette', 'pretty', 'good', 'insight', 'complex', 'themes', 'buried', 'busy', 'comedy', 'most', 'fun', 'are', 'last', 'two', 'features', '80', 'Outfit', 'Challenge', 'piece', 'together', 'ultimate', 'outfit', 'based', 'standards', 'time', 'also', 'get', 'Then', 'Now', 'current', 'modern', 'conveniences', '80', 'counterparts', 'blooper', 'reel', ""n't"", 'bad', ""n't"", 'have', 'bust-out-loud', 'quality', 'many', 'do.With', 'two', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'featuring', 'director', 'Gary', 'Winick', 'producers', 'Susan', 'Arnold', 'Donna', 'Arkoff', 'Roth', 'daughters', 'film', 'people-Arnold', 'daughter', 'director/producer', 'Jack', 'Arnold', 'Arkoff', 'Roth', 'daughter', 'z-movie', 'king', 'Samuel', 'Z.', 'Arkoff', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'are', 'more', 'cut', 'norm', 'fun', 'witty', 'asides', 'interesting', 'insights', 'making', 'movie', 'Garner', 'performance', 'other', 'tidbits.A', 'very', 'funny', 'comedy', 'errors', '13', 'excels', 'primarily', 'due', 'Garner', 'Ruffalo', 'strong', 'performances', 'able', 'support', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'Ironically', '13', 'same', 'Big', 'did', 'story', 'little', 'too', 'familiar', 'pat', 'conclusion', 'Still', 'fun', 'entertainment', 'will', 'keep', 'chuckling']",N/A
