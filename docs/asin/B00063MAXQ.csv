It shows us how hard they work to save peoples' lives; they risk their own.The movie's about a fire fighter (played by 'Gladiator''s and 'The Village''s Joaquin Phoenix) who is trapped in a burning building and through out the movie he relives his life just when he became a rookie fire fighter, to his first outings with his future wife, to the first time he went from hosing down fires, to rescuing a man, and to the birth of his first child, and to his rewarding of successful achievement. In the end something tragic happens, which will lead to you crying your eyes out, and finding a new respect for fire fighters.You will be totally blown away from this movie, this is some of its leading actors' best performances.You'll laugh, you'll gasp, you'll cry, you'll have a good time at this movie.",5,This movie shows us how hard fire fighters work.,1097366400,"10 10, 2004",2004,872,"['49', 'audiences', 'eyes', 'reality', 'firefighter', 'job', 'how', 'hard', 'work', 'save', 'peoples', 'lives', 'risk', 'own.The', 'movie', 'fire', 'fighter', 'played', ""'Gladiator"", 's', ""'The"", 'Village', 's', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'who', 'trapped', 'burning', 'building', 'movie', 'life', 'just', 'when', 'became', 'rookie', 'fire', 'fighter', 'first', 'outings', 'future', 'wife', 'first', 'time', 'went', 'hosing', 'down', 'fires', 'rescuing', 'man', 'birth', 'first', 'child', 'rewarding', 'successful', 'achievement', 'end', 'something', 'tragic', 'happens', 'will', 'lead', 'crying', 'eyes', 'out', 'finding', 'new', 'respect', 'fire', 'fighters.You', 'will', 'be', 'totally', 'blown', 'away', 'movie', 'leading', 'actors', 'best', 'performances.You', ""'ll"", 'laugh', ""'ll"", 'gasp', ""'ll"", 'cry', ""'ll"", 'have', 'good', 'time', 'movie']",Ladder 49

Maybe that is why ladder 49struck such a chord inside me.Ladder 49 opens with Jaquin Pheonix racing into a burning warehouse with word that somewhere within the inferno are two possible survivors. When the situation shifts for the worst, Pheonix's character is haunted by the memories of a loving family outside the blaze.What follows in this scene and continues throughout the film, are arguably some of the most intense fire-situations ever captured for a movie. Most people may think of Backdraft, a Ron Howard film, but to me Backdraft had way too many unbelievable flaws to be realistic and ended up being just a good action flick. (Example - to name one - Firefighters racinginto a burning building full of smoke, with nothing but their eye visors flipped down. Reason? They said we, the audience wouldn't be able to tell the difference between actors. Realism...or star power... hm, tough choice. This viewer would rather see intensity of an actual situation, rather than the glitz of a well-makuped actor. What has young Mr Baldwin done since Backdraft again? I keep forgetting.) Climbing off soapbox.I sometimes catch myself throwing this phrase around loosely, but with this I have no doubt, Ladder 49 is one of the 50 best films I have ever seen in my lifetime. John Travolta gives one of his most sincerest performances as a firechief (as my dad was) trying to protect his men, both at work and home. The supporting cast is excellent and I believed every minute of what I was watching. This coming from someone who has spent their entire life around the fire hall.The dvd is spectacular. The dolby digital home theater sound mix couldn't be better. Deep rumblings, wisping flames, spewing steam, and violent explosions rain throughout. The only thing keeping me from from the action, was room temperature. What agreat mix! The video quality is excellent as well; deep blacks and bright flames are well defined and skin tones are natural with crisp details staying true to the directors vision.Ladder 49 is a brilliant and moving film, capturing the brotherhood, heartbreaks, and plentiful adrenaline rushes ofworking in the fire industry. I was a dispatcher for 2 years, the real heroes are the remaining members of my family I mentioned above. I wish we could give the pro-athletes 30 grand a year and give the millions to our firefighters and paramedics.

It is the story of one man in a fire department. It follows the life of Jack, a young firefighter from his first day on the job until a major fire several years later. I found a lot of the plot predictable. I leaned over to my wife on many occasions and said this will happen next or of course they have to introduce this character for this reason which did finally pan out as I had thought.It was enjoyable. The fire scenes were top notch and Joaquin Phoenix gives a good performance. However, there was very little character development for anyone but Jack. There were other men in the firehouse and there were several occasions we were asked to care for them but the writers and director had not given us enough emotional connections to make that happen. In the end I didn't care for the characters and that is a bad thing to say about a movie that obviously was trying to get me to cry.The movie was not without merit. Some of the finest acting came when Joaquin Phoenix did not speak. The subtext he brought across with simple looks was incredible. The worst acting came from John Travolta. I have never been a big Travolta fan but in this film in particular in his most emotionally charged scene, his acting was atrocious. Here he is yelling at the men of the fire house after a tragedy and I am laughing. His acting was so bad here. I have seen seventh graders deliver lines better.Overall, I think this is a good rental flick. If you haven't seen it, you can wait. Joaquin Phoenix is proving again that he is a star in the making. His acting is superb and I hope Hollywood continues to reward him.

The script is formulaic and the dialogue predictable, but this seems like the right moment for a good-natured movie celebrating these guys, their training and discipline.  In its simple sincerity, this succeeds in being strongly patriotic while being completely non-partisan.  This is greatly appreciated in an election year.Joaquin Phoenix is wonderful as a rescuer who gets trapped in a burning building while his captain, played by John Travolta, makes split-second decisions about how, or whether, to send teams into the inferno to find him.  We flash back over his ten-year career as a firefighter, who met his wife while he was still a rookie, and we watch as his family grows and his career flourishes.  Watch the performances of all the other firefighters: what a truthful and enjoyable collection of people.Without spoiling any surprises, it seemed to me that this production would have had a different ending if it had been made before the events of 9/11.I did have to wonder, however, at the size and strength of the frequent explosions in this movie.

857956,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B00063MAXQ,Amanda Richards,"[6, 7]","This movie is more about firefighters than firefighting.  John Travolta (Captain Mike Kennedy) and Joaquin Phoenix (Jack Morrison) are excellent in their gritty roles, portraying very convincingly the terrible conditions and danger firefighters face on a regular basis.Seeing Joaquin cast in a role that allows him to strut his stuff really warms my heart, and the touching storyline of his life and family values tugs at the tear ducts.  The one ""rear-facing"" body shot is somewhat disappointing after seeing Will Smith in I, Robot, but he still fills out a t-shirt rather nicely.The story is told through flashbacks, a concept I am not really fond of, and some of the scenes drag on unnecessarily long without adding to the movie.  The point that Jack's crew is a closely knit bunch, and that the fate of each one affects them all, is repeated over and over, slowing the movie to a crawl in places.Other than that, it is a terrific movie, driving home the fact that we are deeply indebted to the fire department for their courage and dedication.After seeing this movie, you may get the urge to hug the next firefighter that crosses your path, but you should also remember the other brave people in the police force, the hospitals and the various emergency services, who willingly face danger to make our lives safer.To all you wonderful people - Thank you for being there.Amanda Richards, April 4, 2005(In memory of Bob Zeidler, a very funny guy and great reviewer, who left us to our own devices on April 2, 2005.)",4,The Heart and Soul of Firefighting,1112572800,"04 4, 2005",2005,1517,"['movie', 'more', 'firefighters', 'firefighting', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Captain', 'Mike', 'Kennedy', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Jack', 'Morrison', 'are', 'excellent', 'gritty', 'roles', 'portraying', 'very', 'convincingly', 'terrible', 'conditions', 'danger', 'firefighters', 'face', 'regular', 'basis.Seeing', 'Joaquin', 'cast', 'role', 'strut', 'stuff', 'really', 'warms', 'heart', 'touching', 'storyline', 'life', 'family', 'values', 'tugs', 'tear', 'ducts', 'one', 'rear-facing', 'body', 'shot', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'seeing', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Robot', 'still', 'out', 't-shirt', 'rather', 'nicely.The', 'story', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'concept', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'fond', 'scenes', 'drag', 'unnecessarily', 'long', 'adding', 'movie', 'point', 'Jack', 'crew', 'closely', 'knit', 'bunch', 'fate', 'one', 'repeated', 'slowing', 'movie', 'crawl', 'places.Other', 'terrific', 'movie', 'driving', 'home', 'fact', 'are', 'deeply', 'indebted', 'fire', 'department', 'courage', 'dedication.After', 'seeing', 'movie', 'may', 'get', 'urge', 'hug', 'next', 'firefighter', 'path', 'should', 'also', 'remember', 'other', 'brave', 'people', 'police', 'force', 'hospitals', 'various', 'emergency', 'services', 'who', 'willingly', 'face', 'danger', 'make', 'lives', 'safer.To', 'wonderful', 'people', 'Thank', 'being', 'there.Amanda', 'Richards', 'April', '4', '2005', 'memory', 'Bob', 'Zeidler', 'very', 'funny', 'guy', 'great', 'reviewer', 'who', 'left', 'own', 'devices', 'April', '2', '2005']",Ladder 49

You cannot just watch it while, say, shooting the breeze with a friend or two.

To watch this film is to appreciate what it means to have faith, to have a family, to have friends while at the same time risking your life because you have the skill and know-how to do a dangerous job.

Don't get me wrong, the visual effects were great and the respect shown for the dangers and sacrafices firefighters make for the public are clearly relayed in this film.  However, there wasn't much of a plot to the film; about twenty minutes into the movie I was still wondering why I was still watching it.  There wasn't much a climax to the script and most of the movie was very predictable and FULL of cliches. Also, the film lacked a lot of character development.  I'm the type of viewer who like to know a characters background to really feel for the character, and that was overlooked for many of the characters in this film.  I wanted to know more about the other firefighters in the station who were also a part of the ""family"".  Also, the romance between Pheonix's character and that of Barretts seemed rushed and flat.  There was definitly room for growth and elaboration for that relationship.Now, acting wise, Juaquin Pheonix did give a great performance throughout the film, but however I felt that Travolta was either underacting in some scenes, or overacting in others.  Also, newcomer Jacinda Barrett wasn't a very strong actor in this film as well.  It just seemed as though many scenes demanded more than she was able to give, or maybe I just can't get over that she is Jacinda from The Real World - London.This film had so much potential had the casting been done differently and there had been a stronger script and character development.  The special effects where great and were the only reason the film managed to keep my interest until the end.The DVD has many many Special Features worth checking out, and there is a great ""Everday Heroes"" feature in which real firefighters share their own stories that is truly worth checking out.Also, the soundtrack to the film is worth 5/5 stars.

857959,AMIGVTZZIWS6I,B00063MAXQ,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","I have for the most part avoided any film about and/or inspired by the attacks of September 11 -- they've all just seemed so exploitational.  For the longest time I lumped Ladder 49 into that category.  Recently, a friend convinced me to watch the film and I'm glad I did.  This film is one of the best I've seen about firefighters.  Often, when you see films like this they present the characters as these superhuman-like heroes.  Ladder 49 shows us that firefighters are not superhuman heroes, but brave, fallible people who engage in activities that are, at time, heroic.  Not because they have this huge ego or want to act like something more than they are, but because they have a desire to help people in danger.  I applaud the film for giving a balanced picture of the good and bad involved in being a firefighter. Joaquin Phoenix's performances as Jack is simply wonderful, one his best in a very long time.  Even John Travolta's mostly supporting role is well done.  We get to see Jack's life in the form of flashbacks as he tries to survive a bad fire situation and when the end comes, Phoenix captures Jack's heroism is such a subtle and low-key way that you can't help but be emotional.  The real surprise, I thought, was Jacinda Barrett's quiet, but emotional, performance as Jack's wife, Linda.  Who would have thought a former ""MTV Real World"" participant could be that good.

857960,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B00063MAXQ,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[3, 4]","It's difficult not to compare this movie to Ron Howards (now classic) Fireman yarn, and this is probably the first dedicated firefighter movie since that one was released. There, however most of the similarity ends, as this is most definitely a thought provoking drama, rather than an action flick. The pyrotechnics and visual effects are of course impressive, but they take a back seat to a gritty and realistic story that underpins the whole picture. Rather than ""A Day in the Life"" style flick, this is more like a ""Life in One Day"" (or just over 90 minutes to be precise) condensed story of firefighter Jack Morrison, played extremely competently by Joaquin Phoenix. The opening scene finds a 4 alarm fire in Baltimore harbor, and our character becomes trapped in the unsafe inferno after an explosion, and begins to reflect on his life. Therein lies the story quite simply - we are shown in flashback sequences his journey from fresh faced single rookie, to seasoned pro with wife, family, responsibility and everything in between. There are some funny moments, the usual male bonding scenes, but always a sober reflection, that is never heavy handed on a difficult job, done day in and day out by many unsung heroes across the country. John Travolta as the fire chief, station commander, friend and mentor is excellent, and seems in my mind to get better as he gets older as an actor. This is not a special effects junkies movie, nor is it plodding biopic, but balances the two well, and makes for absorbing viewing. Dramatic and at times harrowing, this is not a movie for a younger audience, but I heartily recommend it to anyone who has ever been interested in the real work of the emergency services.

857961,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00063MAXQ,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","`Ladder 49' is tender and touching, a film that will tug at the heartstrings of just about anyone.  If you're not at least on the verge of tears by the time the credits begin to roll then you may want to check you're pulse.  That said, the weepy or sappy aspect of this movie at times can be a drawback, for it makes it come across overly sentimental and not quite `dramatic' enough to be realistic, but this is minor and for the most part the film connects well with the viewer.It's a film that is designed to get at you, to make you weep in the heroic acts of our men in uniform and their tragic sacrifices for our safety and betterment.  In this respect it works quite well.  In fact when I saw this film in the theaters when it was released we happened to have our local fire department present and I sat next to a few of them and after the film closed, with tears in all of our eyes, we shook hands and embraced and I thanked them for their bravery.  This is the type of film that elicits your respect and heartfelt gratitude.The film opens with a savage fire engulfing a tall building.  We are then introduced to the firefighters entering that building to rescue the men trapped inside.  Within moments we watch Jack Morrison (our obvious hero) fall through the collapsing floor and all is black.  Now we're in flashback mode and we get to watch Jack as he joins the fire department and we get to see everything that made him the hero we saw in the films blistering opening.  We watch Jack get embraced by his fellow firefighters, meet and fall in love with Linda, become a father, lose friends to the flame; all the while we know that he is lying on his back in rubble waiting to be rescued.There are many moments within this film that work so beautifully.  One in particular has stayed with me for quite a long time.  There is a scene within the film where Jack Morrison and fellow firefighter Lenny Richter (Phoenix's `Walk the Line' costar Robert Patrick) receive medals of honor for rescuing a young girl from a devastating fire.  This scene alone touched me deeper than any other scene in the film, even the emotional ending.  It was simple, it was sincere and it was moving.  It wasn't overly sappy or forced.  It was a small act but watching that young girl hand them their medals was almost too much for me to bear up under.One great draw to this film is the impressive action sequences.  The fire rescue missions are so realistic and breathtaking you feel as though you are there fighting the fire with them.  One scene in particular where Morrison is searching through a smoke filled apartment you feel almost suffocated by the fumes.  Director Jay Russell delivers beautifully in this respect.`Ladder 49' owes a lot to the acting as well.  Phoenix is a little too `jolly' at times, kind of childish in the very beginning, but he grows into his character well.  The rest of the cast though doesn't have any problems grabbing hold of their character from the moment the step on the screen till the moment their presence is gone.  John Travolta, an actor I'm not generally impressed with, actually impressed me.  As the Captain he manages to infuse enough humor into his dramatic and almost parental performance that he becomes relatable and very likable.  Robert Patrick has perfected playing the jerk and he doesn't disappoint here.  A jerk with a heart.  Morris Chestnut is sorely underused, but he works well with what he's given.  The true standout here though is the beautiful Jacinda Barrett who delivers an award worthy performance as Linda, Jack's long suffering wife.  She portrays perfectly that mix of admiration and frustration with her husband's dangerous line of work.When all is said and done `Ladder 49' accomplishes what it sets out to do.  It touches our hearts and makes us think about those men and women that risk their lives everyday so that we can feel safe.  At times it may tug a little too hard or a little too often but it's a forgivable misstep in a film that is so likable and moving you can't help but pardon its minor error.",4,An emotional rollercoaster of a film that leaves you breathless...,1201737600,"01 31, 2008",2008,4071,"['Ladder', '49', 'tender', 'touching', 'film', 'will', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'just', 'anyone', ""'re"", 'not', 'least', 'verge', 'tears', 'time', 'credits', 'begin', 'roll', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'check', ""'re"", 'pulse', 'said', 'weepy', 'sappy', 'aspect', 'movie', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'drawback', 'come', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'not', 'quite', 'dramatic', 'enough', 'be', 'realistic', 'minor', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'connects', 'well', 'viewer.It', 'film', 'designed', 'get', 'make', 'weep', 'heroic', 'acts', 'men', 'uniform', 'tragic', 'sacrifices', 'safety', 'betterment', 'respect', 'quite', 'well', 'fact', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'theaters', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'happened', 'have', 'local', 'fire', 'department', 'present', 'sat', 'next', 'few', 'film', 'closed', 'tears', 'eyes', 'shook', 'hands', 'embraced', 'thanked', 'bravery', 'type', 'film', 'respect', 'heartfelt', 'gratitude.The', 'film', 'savage', 'fire', 'engulfing', 'tall', 'building', 'are', 'then', 'introduced', 'firefighters', 'entering', 'building', 'rescue', 'men', 'trapped', 'inside', 'Within', 'moments', 'watch', 'Jack', 'Morrison', 'obvious', 'hero', 'fall', 'collapsing', 'floor', 'black', 'Now', ""'re"", 'flashback', 'mode', 'get', 'watch', 'Jack', 'fire', 'department', 'get', 'see', 'everything', 'made', 'hero', 'saw', 'films', 'blistering', 'opening', 'watch', 'Jack', 'get', 'embraced', 'fellow', 'firefighters', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'Linda', 'become', 'father', 'lose', 'friends', 'flame', 'know', 'lying', 'back', 'rubble', 'waiting', 'be', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'film', 'work', 'so', 'beautifully', 'One', 'particular', 'stayed', 'quite', 'long', 'time', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'Jack', 'Morrison', 'fellow', 'firefighter', 'Lenny', 'Richter', 'Phoenix', 'Walk', 'Line', 'costar', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'receive', 'medals', 'honor', 'rescuing', 'young', 'girl', 'devastating', 'fire', 'scene', 'alone', 'touched', 'deeper', 'other', 'scene', 'film', 'even', 'emotional', 'ending', 'was', 'simple', 'was', 'sincere', 'was', 'moving', 'was', ""n't"", 'overly', 'sappy', 'forced', 'was', 'small', 'act', 'watching', 'young', 'girl', 'hand', 'medals', 'was', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'bear', 'up', 'under.One', 'great', 'draw', 'film', 'impressive', 'action', 'sequences', 'fire', 'rescue', 'missions', 'are', 'so', 'realistic', 'breathtaking', 'feel', 'are', 'there', 'fighting', 'fire', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'where', 'Morrison', 'searching', 'smoke', 'filled', 'apartment', 'feel', 'almost', 'suffocated', 'fumes', 'Director', 'Jay', 'Russell', 'delivers', 'beautifully', 'respect.', 'Ladder', '49', 'lot', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'Phoenix', 'little', 'too', 'jolly', 'times', 'kind', 'childish', 'very', 'beginning', 'character', 'well', 'rest', 'cast', 'though', ""n't"", 'have', 'problems', 'grabbing', 'hold', 'character', 'moment', 'step', 'screen', 'moment', 'presence', 'gone', 'John', 'Travolta', 'actor', ""'m"", 'not', 'generally', 'impressed', 'actually', 'impressed', 'Captain', 'infuse', 'enough', 'humor', 'dramatic', 'almost', 'parental', 'performance', 'relatable', 'very', 'likable', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'perfected', 'playing', 'jerk', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'here', 'jerk', 'heart', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'sorely', 'underused', 'well', 'what', 'given', 'true', 'standout', 'here', 'beautiful', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'who', 'award', 'worthy', 'performance', 'Linda', 'Jack', 'long', 'suffering', 'wife', 'perfectly', 'mix', 'admiration', 'frustration', 'husband', 'dangerous', 'line', 'work.When', 'said', 'done', 'Ladder', '49', 'accomplishes', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'hearts', 'think', 'men', 'women', 'risk', 'lives', 'everyday', 'so', 'can', 'feel', 'safe', 'times', 'may', 'tug', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'little', 'too', 'often', 'forgivable', 'misstep', 'film', 'so', 'likable', 'moving', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'pardon', 'minor', 'error']",Ladder 49

He meets his Captain, Mike Kennedy (John Travolta, GET SHORTY, 1995) and the rest of his new extended family as they play jokes on him and generally induct him into their midst using every prank one could think of (finding a live goose in his locker was nice one).As the movie progresses, we watch some of Jack's fellow firefighters die or get injured as Jack climbs the ""ladder"" of rank and prestige within this close-knit brotherhood. We also see him get married, have kids, move from the ladder truck to search-and-rescue, and receive medals for saving lives. And then we get to watch him suffer a terrible fall which leads us back to his life's flashbacks.______________________________________________________________________________Having worked with firemen for many, many years, I can tell you that much of what was shown in LADDER 49 is true. But, like I said earlier, there is much more to firemen than simple heroics and the golden light of prestige. Firemen have one of the highest divorce rates among any profession (Policemen being #1). They also often battle alcoholism (something that is only touched on in this film).Their academies train them well, so a Captain would NEVER go in with a rookie on his first fire. EVER! That was pretty ridiculous.This film is good for what it is: an obvious praise for firemen. And if that's what you want to see, this'll be a great film to watch. But there are better, more relevant firemen related screen versions out there. Most notably is the new RESCUE ME on cable starring Dennis Leary. This new series is not afraid to show the good and bad psychological aspects many firefighters find themselves in. And Ron Howard's BACKDRAFT is a pretty even take on them as well.",3,A Myopic Take On Firefighters,1135382400,"12 24, 2005",2005,2741,"['Whenever', 'see', 'fire', 'truck', 'blazing', 'down', 'road', 'lights', 'flickering', 'sirens', 'singing', 'should', 'move', 'way', 'give', 'men', 'women', 'big', 'red', 'thumbs', 'up', 'sign', 'are', 'way', 'save', 'person', 'building', 'let', 'hope', 'not', 'someone', 'someplace', 'know', 'will', 'enter', 'burning', 'building', 'everyone', 'else', 'message', 'made', 'LADDER', '49', 'want', 'come', 'away', 'watching', 'movie', 'good', 'message', 'Firemen', 'deserve', 'respect', 'especially', 'so', 'many', 'were', 'lost', '9/11', 'attacks', 'are', 'brave', 'strong', 'dedicated', 'pranksterish', 'heroic', 'only', 'part', 'story', 'only', 'part', 'what', 'covered', 'myopic', 'film.Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'WALK', 'THE', 'LINE', '2005', 'Jack', 'Morrison', 'injured', 'veteran', 'firefighter', 'trapped', 'burning', 'inferno', 'who', 'back', 'life', 'fire', 'service', 'are', 're-introduced', 'first', 'day', 'work', 'ladder', 'truck', '49', 'Captain', 'Mike', 'Kennedy', 'John', 'Travolta', 'GET', 'SHORTY', '1995', 'rest', 'new', 'extended', 'family', 'play', 'jokes', 'generally', 'induct', 'midst', 'using', 'prank', 'one', 'could', 'think', 'finding', 'live', 'goose', 'locker', 'was', 'nice', 'one', 'movie', 'watch', 'Jack', 'fellow', 'firefighters', 'die', 'get', 'injured', 'Jack', 'ladder', 'rank', 'prestige', 'close-knit', 'brotherhood', 'also', 'see', 'get', 'married', 'have', 'kids', 'move', 'ladder', 'truck', 'search-and-rescue', 'receive', 'medals', 'saving', 'lives', 'then', 'get', 'watch', 'suffer', 'terrible', 'fall', 'back', 'life', 'flashbacks.______________________________________________________________________________Having', 'worked', 'firemen', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'can', 'tell', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'shown', 'LADDER', '49', 'true', 'said', 'earlier', 'much', 'more', 'firemen', 'simple', 'heroics', 'golden', 'light', 'prestige', 'Firemen', 'have', 'one', 'highest', 'divorce', 'rates', 'profession', 'Policemen', 'being', '1', 'also', 'often', 'battle', 'alcoholism', 'something', 'only', 'touched', 'film', '.Their', 'academies', 'train', 'well', 'Captain', 'would', 'NEVER', 'go', 'rookie', 'first', 'fire', 'EVER', 'was', 'pretty', 'ridiculous.This', 'film', 'good', 'what', 'obvious', 'praise', 'firemen', 'what', 'want', 'see', ""'ll"", 'be', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'are', 'better', 'more', 'relevant', 'firemen', 'related', 'screen', 'versions', 'there', 'Most', 'notably', 'new', 'RESCUE', 'ME', 'cable', 'starring', 'Dennis', 'Leary', 'new', 'series', 'not', 'afraid', 'show', 'good', 'bad', 'psychological', 'aspects', 'many', 'firefighters', 'find', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'BACKDRAFT', 'pretty', 'even', 'take', 'as', 'well']",Ladder 49

After work, Jack shares beers with his Irish Catholic buddies. In the supermarket, he meets a pretty girl. Jack falls in love, marries, and raises two children.  But life is complicated. His best friend, Dennis, dies in a massive blaze. Another man's face is burned by an exploding steam pipe. And Jack's son begins to worry. Jack's family shares the burden and tension: Each day he may face birth, death, and injury.  He might not even come home. But Jack's family supports him. Finally, in one large burning building, Jack is separated, and slides down a chute. Trapped at the bottom, Jack thinks back on his rookie year, his friends, and the destiny that brought him to this....Told in flashback, ""Ladder 49"" is an explosive action-movie, with simple humor, family intimacy, and rousing spectacle. There's no CGI here. Every fire is real. A bulked-up Joaquin Phoenix and a wizened John Travolta star. Joaquin(who, in real life, is afraid of heights) actually dangles on a rope from a 15-story building. An early scene even captures him briefly on fire. The director of ""Ladder 49"" is veteran Jay Russell, who helmed the under-rated ""Tuck Everlasting"". The Touchstone Pictures' DVD is a wide-screen(1.85:1) anamorphic transfer, with THX Dolby digital surround-sound. The soundtrack includes Robbie Robertson's beautiful ""Shine Your Light"". Extras include a commentary, a documentary, deleted scenes, trailers, previews, and Robbie's own video. Great acting. Excellent pyrotechnics. Quite a story.

857972,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00063MAXQ,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[3, 3]","""Ladder 49"" is a tribute type of film- a movie that was created, supposedly, with the intent in mind to make you better appreciate the unselfish service of those who work in the firefighting departments all over the U.S. Starring Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta, this movie follows the life of a new recruit from his beginnings as a rookie, through his marriage and family life, all the way to a fatal fire at the end of the film.I appreciate the fact that the director, Jay Russell, wanted everyone to see what a heroic job firefighters perform every day of their lives. The fire scenes in this film are real, and some of the scenes of the men going into blazing buildings are gripping. And so is the contribution of Joaquin Phoenix. It's interesting to watch the movie's main character, Phoenix's Jack Morrison, develop as the film progresses from a novice firefighter uncertain of himself to a family man trying to balance his personal life with his career.If there is anything bad about this film, it would have to be that it doesn't really contain much originality or much of a story. It is full of clich&eacute;s and it basically presents a guy, his relationships with other firefighters, and his problems with his wife and family. There isn't much more to it than that, and it's the type of film that many will find ordinary and forgettable on its surface.Joaquin Phoenix, John Travolta, and Robert Patrick are among the highlights of this film. They are effective in their roles and they perform well. The movie could use a little more drama in some parts, when the men are fighting fires. They get their job done, but they don't seem that emotional or intense, like you expect them to be.This may not be the greatest Hollywood film of the past year, but it has enough positive qualities to earn it a recommendation. It has little originality, but it does succeed at its core mission: making the viewer more aware of the great sacrifices that firefighters make each day when the sirens sound.",3,Balancing Career and Family as a Firefighter,1113091200,"04 10, 2005",2005,2002,"['Ladder', '49', 'tribute', 'type', 'film-', 'movie', 'was', 'created', 'supposedly', 'intent', 'mind', 'make', 'better', 'appreciate', 'unselfish', 'service', 'who', 'work', 'firefighting', 'departments', 'U.S', 'Starring', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'John', 'Travolta', 'movie', 'life', 'new', 'recruit', 'beginnings', 'rookie', 'marriage', 'family', 'life', 'way', 'fatal', 'fire', 'end', 'film.I', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'director', 'Jay', 'Russell', 'wanted', 'everyone', 'see', 'what', 'heroic', 'job', 'firefighters', 'perform', 'day', 'lives', 'fire', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'real', 'scenes', 'men', 'going', 'blazing', 'buildings', 'are', 'gripping', 'so', 'contribution', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'interesting', 'watch', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'Phoenix', 'Jack', 'Morrison', 'develop', 'film', 'novice', 'firefighter', 'uncertain', 'family', 'man', 'trying', 'balance', 'personal', 'life', 'career.If', 'anything', 'bad', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'be', ""n't"", 'really', 'contain', 'much', 'originality', 'much', 'story', 'full', 'clich', 'eacute', 'basically', 'guy', 'relationships', 'other', 'firefighters', 'problems', 'wife', 'family', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'type', 'film', 'many', 'will', 'find', 'ordinary', 'forgettable', 'surface.Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'are', 'highlights', 'film', 'are', 'effective', 'roles', 'perform', 'well', 'movie', 'could', 'use', 'little', 'more', 'drama', 'parts', 'when', 'men', 'are', 'fighting', 'fires', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'emotional', 'intense', 'expect', 'be.This', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'greatest', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'past', 'year', 'enough', 'positive', 'qualities', 'earn', 'recommendation', 'little', 'originality', 'succeed', 'core', 'mission', 'making', 'viewer', 'more', 'aware', 'great', 'sacrifices', 'firefighters', 'make', 'day', 'when', 'sirens', 'sound']",Ladder 49

The cutting is great, the action tight, but the plot rudimentary. This is NOT a fire thriller in the mode of Backdraft. It profiles the life and career of a rooky foreman. He joins the department, gets married and has children, and grows in firefighting skill and devotion. His biological family and his family of firefighters are both exemplary. But the movie is not a gripping thriller. There is no villain; everybody is a good guy, as it were.That is perhaps the major problem of the film. It is great to have someone to hate (witness the video game tester in the live action ""101 dalmations""). In this film, you or course hate and fear FIRE. But the characters are normal humans--they act and interract, are sometimes loving and sometimes petty, they are goofy, the do well or not so well, etc. The effects are pretty good. But the final big tragic fire is perhaps a trifle contrived. The doom is too inevitable. You could predict what will happen at the end of the film from just about the first scene.The film is good in showing the give-and-take in the normal life of a fire station crew. There are good funny moments, and good melancholy moments. The characters are well established. Also, the film does give homage to the worthiness of fire fighters.But the film fails as gripping or stirring entertainment.",3,"Well-crafted, but bland....",1110153600,"03 7, 2005",2005,1446,"['Kudos', 'go', 'cast', 'film', 'especially', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'firefighter', 'Jack', 'Morrison', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'wife', 'Linda', 'cutting', 'great', 'action', 'tight', 'plot', 'rudimentary', 'NOT', 'fire', 'thriller', 'mode', 'Backdraft', 'life', 'career', 'rooky', 'foreman', 'department', 'married', 'children', 'grows', 'firefighting', 'skill', 'devotion', 'biological', 'family', 'family', 'firefighters', 'are', 'exemplary', 'movie', 'not', 'gripping', 'thriller', 'villain', 'everybody', 'good', 'guy', 'perhaps', 'major', 'problem', 'film', 'great', 'have', 'someone', 'hate', 'video', 'game', 'tester', 'live', 'action', '101', 'dalmations', 'film', 'course', 'hate', 'fear', 'FIRE', 'characters', 'are', 'normal', 'humans', 'act', 'interract', 'are', 'sometimes', 'loving', 'sometimes', 'petty', 'are', 'goofy', 'do', 'well', 'not', 'so', 'well', 'etc', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'final', 'big', 'tragic', 'fire', 'perhaps', 'trifle', 'contrived', 'doom', 'too', 'inevitable', 'could', 'predict', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'end', 'film', 'just', 'first', 'scene.The', 'film', 'good', 'showing', 'give-and-take', 'normal', 'life', 'fire', 'station', 'crew', 'are', 'good', 'funny', 'moments', 'good', 'melancholy', 'moments', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'established', 'Also', 'film', 'give', 'homage', 'worthiness', 'fire', 'fighters.But', 'film', 'gripping', 'stirring', 'entertainment']",Ladder 49

So, I put it in on Friday night and for the next two hours I was absolutely transfixed.The movie starts out where it ends; Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) is trapped in a deadly fire and as he lays waiting for help, he thinks about the past 10 years of his life, both personally and professionally.  The story alternates between Jack's past and the present and I felt it was done very well.The movie shows Jack's professional life as he remembers his first day at the fire station as a rookie and the first fire he fought.  He remembers the little mistakes he made such as forgetting to put on his helmet, and the eagerness and mild apprehension at going into a burning building.  But his mentor and captain (played by John Travolta) was right there with him, showing him the ropes and providing advice and encouragement.  Jack remembers how he grew to be a seasoned firefighter over the next 10 years; he remembers his ""family"" of firefighters and the special friendships he developed; he remembers those special friends and how some were severely injured, and some died.The movie shows Jack's personal life as he also remembers his wife and children and the difficult times his wife went through as she tried to understand his passion for his job.  Jack realizes that he wasn't always there for his family even though he loved them; that perhaps he spent too much time at his job and not enough time with his family.  But how could Jack choose between the two things he loved - his job and his family.Ladder 49 is a tribute to firefighters; those men and women who put their lives on the line everyday.  The story takes you inside the firehouse and shows the sense of family that firefighters develop.  It takes you on the scene of the fire and the inherent dangers that firefighters face every time they battle a blaze.  It takes you inside the personal life of firefighters and shows the struggles that their spouse must deal with.  As Jack's wife (played by Jacinda Barrett) states in the movie, ""I never know when that red car will pull up and someone will come to the door to tell me you're gone.""All-in-all, Ladder 49 is a pretty good movie.  Both Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta are, without question, good actors and Joaquin clearly has the title lead in this story.  It is a disaster movie but didn't have the ""blood and guts"" of most movies of this sort (thank you Jay Russell).

857976,A1W4HQPL1GXHLO,B00063MAXQ,"Casey Crookston ""Casey Crookston""","[1, 1]","This is not your typical, feel-good, happy-sappy Hollywood movie-mill production, and for that I was grateful. If you're a fan of that type of film, I encourage you to expand your horizons before venturing into Ladder 49. This is the kind of movie that leaves you feeling sober, pensive, somber, and maybe even a little more grateful for those willing to risk their lives so we can sleep better at night.It's not a perfect production, and at the heart of the flaws is Mr. Travolta who delivers an almost flat and empty performance. I say ""almost"" because in the last five minutes of the film his character Captain Mike Kennedy finally comes to life and turns believable. During the rest of the film it's just too obvious that we're watching an actor try to fit into a role which he has not fully assimilated and doesn't know how to play.Counter that with the performance of Joaquin Phoenix, who is quickly becoming one of my all time favorites. He first appeared on my radar screen for his role as Commodus in Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" where he was so positively gross and horrible that it took some time for me to realize that Phoenix was only acting. Add to that his roles in M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" and ""The Village"" and you have one of the most talented and diverse actors alive today.In Ladder 49 he plays firefighter Jack Morrison, and we watch his career progress through a series of flashbacks which take place as he is trapped in a burning grain elevator in Boston harbor. Phoenix takes a comfortable and casual approach to the role and perfectly pulls off being an ordinary guy torn between his family and his career. It's a common situation in Hollywood movies, but Phoenix is remarkable believable.There are a few scenes the film could have done without, mostly because they felt too obvious and cheap.Example 1: After the death of a fellow firefighter the crew is sitting back at the firehouse. An old veteran comments that his death was avoidable and that he made an obvious mistake. Morrison (Phoenix) erupts at the slander of his dead friend and a fight breaks out, but is quickly broken up by Captain Kennedy (Trivolta) who, surprise, yells and screams and belittles them both for behaving such a way in ""my house.""Example 2: Shortly after Morrison falls in love with Linda (Jacinda Barrett) the two are in a bar with the rest of the fire house crew, everyone becoming progressively drunk, and of course they play the usual drinking games of who can down more booze then the other.Both scenes, and several others like them, are clear attempts to show normal human nature, but are so obvious, expected, and over used that they make much of the film feel cookie-cutter and stereotyped. Couple that with a lazy performance by Trivolta, and it adds up to a not-so-wonderful job by director Jay Russell. It's a good thing he had Phoenix and an overall inspiring subject, which more then compensate and turn the movie into a solid four stars.In a nutshell, Ladder 49 ia a film everyone should see.

It is another one of Hollywood's pencil pushers ""take no risk and use formulas that are sure to work"" offerings. It is cliche ridden, and extremely predictable. However!!! It is well done, and it is very entertaining. This movie does have its charm, and it has a way of drawing you in.The story is told both in flashback and present day sequences as Jack (Phoenix) is trapped in a burning building cut off from his squad, while the conditions of his surroundings are deteriorating rapidly. Through flashback we are taken back to his first day on the job, and his bonding with his co-workers, his meetiing and marrying his wife (Jacinda Barrett), and his witnessing the death and injury of a couple of his co-workers. In the present, we see his co-workers' desperate attempts to rescue him as they are urged on by a relentless and determined Captain (Travolta).As one who was a firefighter (30 years ago in Detroit) I found the procedures to be questionable - perhaps the way I was tought all those years ago is obsolete now. The action sequences are good, but like most movies about firefighting, they are far from accurate. If an accurate firefighting scene was to be filmed, all you would see is smoke and an orange glow when you got to the fire. You can see absolutely nothing in a burning building but smoke. No one who knows me will watch a firefighting movie with me.There are some tense moments that are well directed and acted. The emotional moments are compelling despite being predictable and contrived. Perhaps I was drawn in because I was once a fireman and I know the sacrifice these people make and what it takes to run into a burning building. It definatly ain't money that urges the fire fighter into those situations. It is, a love of the job and a sense of duty.If you are looking for something profound, original and thought provoking, then this is not the movie for you. If you are looking to be entertained and have your emotional strings tugged a bit, then this is a perfect movie for you. It is a great tribute to firefighters and a decent insight into who they are.Oh you are probably wondering if Jack makes it out alive, I ain't telling.",3,"Nothing New, but Very Entertaining",1109203200,"02 24, 2005",2005,2219,"['not', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'original', 'movie', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'pencil', 'take', 'risk', 'use', 'formulas', 'are', 'sure', 'work', 'offerings', 'cliche', 'ridden', 'extremely', 'predictable', 'However', 'well', 'done', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'have', 'charm', 'way', 'drawing', 'in.The', 'story', 'told', 'flashback', 'present', 'day', 'sequences', 'Jack', 'Phoenix', 'trapped', 'burning', 'building', 'cut', 'off', 'squad', 'conditions', 'surroundings', 'are', 'deteriorating', 'rapidly', 'flashback', 'are', 'taken', 'back', 'first', 'day', 'job', 'bonding', 'co-workers', 'meetiing', 'marrying', 'wife', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'witnessing', 'death', 'injury', 'couple', 'co-workers', 'present', 'see', 'co-workers', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'rescue', 'are', 'urged', 'relentless', 'determined', 'Captain', 'Travolta', '.As', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'firefighter', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'Detroit', 'found', 'procedures', 'be', 'questionable', 'perhaps', 'way', 'was', 'tought', 'years', 'ago', 'obsolete', 'now', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'good', 'most', 'movies', 'firefighting', 'are', 'far', 'accurate', 'accurate', 'firefighting', 'scene', 'was', 'be', 'filmed', 'would', 'see', 'smoke', 'orange', 'glow', 'when', 'got', 'fire', 'can', 'see', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'burning', 'building', 'smoke', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'watch', 'firefighting', 'movie', 'me.There', 'are', 'tense', 'moments', 'are', 'well', 'directed', 'acted', 'emotional', 'moments', 'are', 'compelling', 'being', 'predictable', 'contrived', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'drawn', 'was', 'once', 'fireman', 'know', 'sacrifice', 'people', 'make', 'what', 'run', 'burning', 'building', 'definatly', 'ai', ""n't"", 'money', 'fire', 'fighter', 'situations', 'love', 'job', 'sense', 'duty.If', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'profound', 'original', 'thought', 'provoking', 'then', 'not', 'movie', 'are', 'looking', 'be', 'entertained', 'have', 'emotional', 'strings', 'tugged', 'bit', 'then', 'perfect', 'movie', 'great', 'tribute', 'firefighters', 'decent', 'insight', 'who', 'are.Oh', 'are', 'probably', 'wondering', 'Jack', 'out', 'alive', 'ai', ""n't"", 'telling']",Ladder 49

It is about character, heroes who do things professionally instead of mental patients who take too many risks and can outrun explosions (right...).  While the movie has its action sequences with flames, helicopters, and tragic injuries, it is less about these scenes than the kind of people who do this work for us.  You know the clich&eacute;, they run into the burning building while we scurry out.  It is clich&eacute;, but true.The movie opens with a huge concrete building in flames.  Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) and his fellow firefighters are trying to find some people on the upper floors.  As Jack lowers one of them to the ground in a rather realistic and heroic way, the floor beneath him gives way and he falls.  Of course he is injured and the movie now cuts between his present situation with his friends trying to get him out of there and his career as a firefighter.We meet Jack as a rookie coming into Ladder 49 (his firehouse).  Mike Kennedy (John Travolta) is his Captain and sees to Jack's training.  We get to know these men and their fellow firefighters by their interactions at the fire station as well as their professional work in a very dangerous job.  We see their earnest and simple motivations for their work and how they react when the alarm calls them to action.Frankly, I would have like to have seen more of their training and how that came into play during the fires, but we do see how firefighters work and the dangers they face.  It isn't just the flame and the smoke, but the structures are falling to pieces and they never know when something will give way, shift, or explode.We see Jack progress in his career, how he builds his family, and the strain he (and his family) faces when his friends are injured and killed (I can't even hint at who or how).  There is more than enough heroism in this movie to go around.  But it is never overdone and I was glad that they honored the profession by keeping the action within bounds.  Obviously, certain concessions are made for Hollywood, but this is not so much an action flick as an affectionate portrait for these heroes.Good family flick. The movie doesn't make much of the violence and gore is not shoved in your face.  The language is surprisingly clean for a fire house and the hijinks are more on the level of a summer camp than depraved.Enjoy.",5,Affectionate portrait of firefighters.

This film is so touching, so moving.  The performances by the stellar cast (Phoenix, Trovolta and Barrett) were above superb.  The story revolves around Jack Morrison (Phoenix) as he reflecs about his life as a fire fighter while he lies in rubble in a burning building awaiting his rescue.  The movie is done in flashbacks as we watch Jack get welcomed to the fire house by fellow fighters as well as his captian Mike Kennidy (Trovolta).  We watch him gain respect, help put out his first fire, meet and fall in love with Linda (Barrett) and eventually marry her, wittness the birth of his children, the death of his best friend and even save a life or two... (the scene where he recieves his medal of honor will bring quite a few tears to your eyes)  Phoenix was by far at his best here, but the scene stealer to me was Barrett who played his wife.  The mastered the loving, concerned wife perfectly (much like Rennee did in Ciderella Man)  The entire film is built to make you feel proud and depressed all at the same time.  When my wife and I saw this movie we actually watched it with a few of the fighters for the Fort Worth F.D. and I sat next to one of them who pretty much bawled the whole movie.

I have seen a few bad fires in my life, even doused a few...this movie is as realistic as it gets.Joaquin Phoenix, playing rookie firefighter Jack Morrison, occasionally gives us that ""frozen face - semi-stupid"" look that Tobey Maguire has made a career of, but unlike Maguire, Phoenix is a very solid actor.

He is extremely convincing in his role, as are the rest of the actors and actresses in this great movie.Ladder 49 offers some great scenes, memorable dialogue, and a cast of great characters.

Be mindful that this is not a sequel or has anything to do with the universe of ""Backdraft"" at all.Starring Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta as the leading cast, and set in the gritty neighborhoods of Baltimore, it's the story of a ten year veteran firefighter named Jack Morrison under the advice of his mentor who during the worst fire of his career at an industrial complex reflects on his lifetime leading up to the industrial fire as he tries to escape from the place. The complex that he's trapped in is partially collapsing and he's trapped in a space with debris all around him and the whole place threatens to collapse at any time with all of the chemical explosives around the place.This is a really marvelous movie that I thought was a lot better than I thought it would be.Many have criticize parts of ""Backdraft"" due to some unrealistic things about it and I've noticed flaws in it, while I'll always enjoy that one, ""Ladder 49"" in my opinion corrects some of those flaws and the result is a much more realistic looking movie.Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta put on an excellent duo role as firefighter and mentor chief and Travolta especially in my opinion really gets back on his feet after the effects of that horrible 2000 atrocity that was ""Battlefield Earth"".This is a must-see film.

The movie contains no Soap Opera material or love triangle nonsense.  There are no invincible, James Bond type firemen running around putting out infernos all by themselves.  Rather, the plot centers around the daily struggles of people in the firefighting business;  both in their professional as well as their personal lives.Joaquin Phoenix proves that he is up to the task of playing a very likable character.  Unlike most of the characters portrayed by John Travolta, the captain of the firehouse is only slightly nuts (as opposed to completely nuts!).  The acting is splendid all-around & I did not notice any weaknesses in that department.While there are some spectacular scenes in LADDER 49, I liked the fact that the filmmakers did not try to get TOO extreme and caught up in making far-fetched heroic scenes.  I would think that every episode depicted in the film would have a counterpart mirrored in real-life.  For once, there is a movie about courage that is not ""Hollywoodized"" beyond belief.Another nice touch is that the story takes place in Baltimore.  As most movies of this type take place in either New York, Chicago or LA, it was good to see a different American city portrayed on film.  Even better, in the Special Features the DVD contains interviews and commentary with real Baltimore firemen & their families.  Nicely done.I readily admit that I am not a fireman myself.  However, I can't help but think that this movie speaks for a great many firemen across the country.  I would be mortified to find out that firemen could not relate to at least some aspects of this story.  I can't think of a higher compliment to pay this movie than that.So, here is the bottom line.

Though it brought my girlfriend to tears by the end, it didn't grab me nearly as much. Its watchable enough though.The film focuses on Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) and his life at the firestation, from when he first joined (with all the pranks his fellow firefighters pull on him and each other) through the courtship and marriage of his wife (Jacinda Barrett), the birth of his children and the loss of close friends to the flame, whether by death or injury. My little brother called it a ""manly chick flick"". I didn't really see it that way, but I know where he's coming from. During the course of the movie, Jack and his firefighting have friendships tested, relationships strained and face tough decisions, coming out all the more stronger for it.

It kind of reminded me of the story structure of ""Catch Me If You Can"", which begins with Frank Abagnale Jr (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) in jail, then flashes back to before he had committed any crimes. Never really liked the whole ""how does his life lead to this?"" angle. The dialogue bothered me a little too, it felt a little wooden. Maybe it was the writing, maybe it was the delivery, maybe it was a bit of both, hard to say.Special features include deleted scenes, a few behind the scenes featurettes, a featurette about real life firefighters and an audio commentary.

This movie does exactly what its supposed to do, tell a compelling story of bravery and service to the public while presenting it in a way that illicits an emotional response. The acting by Travolta in this movie is very good genuinely believable. Joaquin Phoenix gives stale performance as a rookie fire fighter but the story is compelling enough for the viewer to overlook his vapid performance. The director guides the audience through the trials and tribulations of fire fighters quite effectively using the now familiar flashback story telling method. It works well in this film as we see the relationship between Phoenix and Travolta grow into a strong friendship.

858003,A2VRAT69JDAD3W,B00063MAXQ,"Jason Whitt ""Whittmeister""","[5, 9]","I will begin by saying that my review in no way reflects on the brave and selfless nature of the people who fight fires.  They are truly heroes and deserve our utmost respect and appreciation.  In fact, those people deserved a better film.Ladder 49 is a movie filled with lofty intentions and themes.  Among them are courageousness, heroism, comeraderie in the face of danger, family values, and self sacrifice.  Of course none of these themes are very original, but that doesn't mean the film couldn't still be a winner.  Unfortunately the overfamiliar themes are executed in such a grossly derivitive/cliched manner by the screenplay writer, director, score writer and editor that the film ultimately succumbs under the weight of them.  The film is so loaded with cliches in fact, that halfway through it one might conclude that it could have been made more cheaply and effectively simply by splicing together scenes from other films.  And maybe it was just the writing, but I was both surprised and disappointed to find Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta's performances to be exceedingly uninspired and stock.The story begins and revolves around the life of Jack (Phoenix), a gung-ho young man who fulfills his dream to become a firefighter in the city of Baltimore.  Be warned.  His story is told in a series of poorly paced flashback scenes that jump from the past 10 years of events in his life, then back to a burning building in which he is presently trapped.  Each flashback installment represents a different cliche that has been done better in various other films.The first flashback depicts the ""let's play a practical joke on the new guy."" routine right out of the gate.  Wow, never seen that before!  Soon thereafter Jack predictably becomes the ""mascot"" and favorite in the department.  He also comes to represent a son of sorts to the one dimesnional Chief played by Travolta.  This relationship is never cultivated by any particular events in the film.  The viewer is simply expected to accept that since Jack's is the main character, that he also is the Chief's favorite.  As such their whole relationship seems phony, as do Travolta's ridculous gray painted sideburns.Later we learn that being an alcoholic Catholic is apparently a prerequisite to work at this Baltimore station. Ladder 49 plays that offensive and tired stereotype to the hilt.  This crew apparently spends 50% of their time at the station and the other 50% at the bar.A flashback or two later Jack naturally meets his ""special girl"" in a supermarket (where else?).  It is apparent from the start of this scene that there is absolutely no chemistry between Phoenix and his leading lady.  This is one of the largest failures in Ladder 49.  Later in the film these two have the inevitable ""It's hard to be married to a firefighter, cop, soldier."" issues.  These scenes play more like bad soap opera than high budget production.As Ladder 49 drones on, we predictably see a buddy or two get seriously injured or killed.  (Here's where the cliches really get going.)  After a member of the crew is killed in a fire, we see the crew back at the station.  Words are exchanged and before you know it, a few members of the crew get into the grief/anger induced fisticuffs with each other.  Right on cue, the Chief played by Travolta dashes in to stop the fracas and give his ""fallen brother"" speech to set the crew straight.Even the music editing is bad.  There isn't a scene in Ladder 49 that tries to stand on its own merit.  The music in the film all but hits you over head in trying to tell you what you're supposed to be feeling at any given moment.  I could go on and on about how this film is a series of manipulative cliches, but by now I'm sure you get the point.  Suffice it to say that if you've seen a couple of war, sports, and cop movies in your lifetime, then Ladder 49 has very little to offer you.The only thing I can say that is positive about the film is that the audio production on the DVD is quite good.  So if you're looking for a DVD to show off your subwoofer, this is a good choice.",2,Where's a good ledge to jump off when you need one?,1110931200,"03 16, 2005",2005,4084,"['will', 'begin', 'saying', 'review', 'way', 'brave', 'selfless', 'nature', 'people', 'who', 'fight', 'fires', 'are', 'truly', 'heroes', 'deserve', 'utmost', 'respect', 'appreciation', 'fact', 'people', 'deserved', 'better', 'film.Ladder', '49', 'movie', 'filled', 'lofty', 'intentions', 'themes', 'are', 'courageousness', 'heroism', 'comeraderie', 'face', 'danger', 'family', 'values', 'sacrifice', 'course', 'none', 'themes', 'are', 'very', 'original', ""n't"", 'mean', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'still', 'be', 'winner', 'Unfortunately', 'overfamiliar', 'themes', 'are', 'executed', 'such', 'grossly', 'derivitive/cliched', 'manner', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'director', 'score', 'writer', 'editor', 'film', 'ultimately', 'succumbs', 'weight', 'film', 'so', 'loaded', 'cliches', 'fact', 'halfway', 'one', 'might', 'conclude', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'more', 'cheaply', 'effectively', 'simply', 'splicing', 'together', 'scenes', 'other', 'films', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'writing', 'was', 'surprised', 'disappointed', 'find', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'John', 'Travolta', 'performances', 'be', 'exceedingly', 'uninspired', 'stock.The', 'story', 'begins', 'around', 'life', 'Jack', 'Phoenix', 'gung-ho', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'dream', 'become', 'firefighter', 'city', 'Baltimore', 'Be', 'warned', 'story', 'told', 'series', 'poorly', 'paced', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'jump', 'past', '10', 'years', 'events', 'life', 'then', 'back', 'burning', 'building', 'presently', 'trapped', 'flashback', 'installment', 'different', 'cliche', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'various', 'other', 'films.The', 'first', 'flashback', 'let', 'play', 'practical', 'joke', 'new', 'guy', 'routine', 'right', 'gate', 'Wow', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'Soon', 'thereafter', 'Jack', 'predictably', 'mascot', 'favorite', 'department', 'also', 'represent', 'son', 'sorts', 'one', 'dimesnional', 'Chief', 'played', 'Travolta', 'relationship', 'never', 'cultivated', 'particular', 'events', 'film', 'viewer', 'simply', 'expected', 'accept', 'Jack', 'main', 'character', 'also', 'Chief', 'favorite', 'such', 'whole', 'relationship', 'phony', 'do', 'Travolta', 'ridculous', 'gray', 'painted', 'sideburns.Later', 'learn', 'being', 'alcoholic', 'Catholic', 'apparently', 'prerequisite', 'work', 'Baltimore', 'station', 'Ladder', '49', 'plays', 'offensive', 'tired', 'stereotype', 'hilt', 'crew', 'apparently', '50', '%', 'time', 'station', 'other', '50', '%', 'bar.A', 'flashback', 'two', 'later', 'Jack', 'naturally', 'special', 'girl', 'supermarket', 'where', 'else', 'apparent', 'start', 'scene', 'absolutely', 'chemistry', 'Phoenix', 'leading', 'lady', 'one', 'largest', 'failures', 'Ladder', '49', 'Later', 'film', 'two', 'have', 'inevitable', 'hard', 'be', 'married', 'firefighter', 'cop', 'soldier', 'issues', 'scenes', 'play', 'more', 'bad', 'soap', 'opera', 'high', 'budget', 'production.As', 'Ladder', '49', 'drones', 'predictably', 'see', 'buddy', 'two', 'get', 'seriously', 'injured', 'killed', 'Here', 'where', 'cliches', 'really', 'get', 'going', 'member', 'crew', 'killed', 'fire', 'see', 'crew', 'back', 'station', 'Words', 'are', 'exchanged', 'know', 'few', 'members', 'crew', 'get', 'grief/anger', 'induced', 'fisticuffs', 'other', 'Right', 'cue', 'Chief', 'played', 'Travolta', 'dashes', 'stop', 'fracas', 'give', 'fallen', 'brother', 'speech', 'set', 'crew', 'music', 'editing', 'bad', ""n't"", 'scene', 'Ladder', '49', 'tries', 'stand', 'own', 'merit', 'music', 'film', 'hits', 'head', 'trying', 'tell', 'what', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'feeling', 'given', 'moment', 'could', 'go', 'how', 'film', 'series', 'manipulative', 'cliches', 'now', ""'m"", 'sure', 'get', 'point', 'Suffice', 'say', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'couple', 'war', 'sports', 'cop', 'movies', 'lifetime', 'then', 'Ladder', '49', 'very', 'little', 'offer', 'you.The', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'positive', 'film', 'audio', 'production', 'DVD', 'quite', 'good', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'DVD', 'show', 'off', 'subwoofer', 'good', 'choice']",Ladder 49

Ladder 49 managed to earn 2 stars, one of them for the excellent fire effects, and the other... well, I can't tell you about the other.Joaquin Phoenix is Jack Morrison, firefighter extraordinaire! The movie starts off with the burning building we've all seen in the previews, and Jack is running around inside trying to save people. In short order he finds himself separated from his buddies and wondering if he'll make it out alive. But wait! We're only 10 minutes into the movie, sounds like a good time for a flashback! That's right, this story is told via the tried-n-true ""look at me in trouble and see what happened earlier in my life to get me here"" method.I hate flashback movies.The other big name in this film is John Travolta who plays Captain Mike , and who does a damn fine job of it. Then, when does Travolta not do a damn fine job? Honestly, the acting in this movie is top notch with all of the actors turning in great performances. Whether they're goofing off at the station or running through a burning building, we totally buy into their characters.The real star of this movie though is the fire as this movie has the best fire-effects I've ever seen. If you want to see a big fire, forget the rating on this movie and just go see it, you won't be disappointed. It's the non-fire scenes that I have a problem with.This is not an action movie, this is a drama, and I'm ok with that. What I'm not ok with is how freakin predictable everything was. We get to see Jack on his first day as a rookie... Jack on his first fire... Jack meets a girl... Jack loses a friend... Jack has a career crises... Jack get to be a hero... blah blah blah. There are no real surprises here, as soon as you realize the movie is all a flashback you already know the main characters are never in any real danger and you're just waiting to get back to real-time. Quite annoying.If you're really into firefighters then by all means, go see this one on the big screen. If you're into a mushy plot, then go for it! If you've just GOT to see the big fire and that's the only reason you want to see the movie... then I'll point out again that you see the fire in the first 10 minutes of the movie.

LADDER 49 goes some way to remedy this.As the film opens, veteran fireman Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) enters the towering inferno of a burning industrial structure - perhaps reminiscent of the World Trade Center - to search for the living. After saving a life, Jack is pitched by collapsing floors into the basement, where he's trapped by rubble and menaced by falling debris. Still in radio communication with the outside, he awaits rescue or certain death. Throughout the ordeal, the audience  flashbacks through Jack's ten years on the job, starting with his first day as a probationer assigned to Engine Company 33 of the Baltimore City Fire Department. As the years pass, the boyishly charming Morrison falls in love with and weds wife Linda (Jacinda Barrett), has kids, and sees fellow fireman die or become seriously injured. The job exacts its toll on Jack's marriage and psyche, but he's continually supported by his spouse, the camaraderie of his extended family of colleagues in the engine company, and the paternalistic master of his fire station, Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta).There are no particular plot surprises in LADDER 49, but it rises above being average via excellent special FX and strong, sympathetic performances by both Phoenix and Travolta. This viewer truly cared about Jack, his family, and his work buddies. (It doesn't hurt that America loves, or should love, its firefighters. They are, after all, both heroic and inoffensive at the same time.

Joaquin Pheonix delivers a terrific performance as a rookie fireman assigned to a close knit unit in Baltimore.  We see him grow from a newbie to a brave partner who in the end, risks his life to save others with a selfless quality that all firemen have, but few actors have so effectively played on film.  John Travolta as the Chief firefighter and mentor to his team, is also very solid. There are lighthearted moments to be sure, but most of all, this is an affecting drama that highlights the courage and tenacity of the men and women who battle neighborhood blazes day in and day out.

Yeah I don't like some actors either but you can't rate a movie bad just because you dont like someone.  This movie is not about one actor its about firefighters and seeing what they actually do.  Rate movies because of the quality of movie.  John Travolta's acting wasn't so terrible that the movie was a waste of time.  It has amazing special effects and you are brought into every fire the movie has.  The acting was not bad at all and I give it a four stars because overall this movie came together and made out for a surperb ending. Yeah its sad but its life and this is what real firefighters go through.  My dad is a firefighter and though he isn't running into 50 story buildings he has still been inside a burning building and helped people.

BUT, AREN'T THERE ANY FEMALE FIRE FIGHTERS ON THE FORCE?This is a mildly entertaining movie about the first 10 years of the career of a firefighter, told in flashbacks. It is not a bad movie, I just didn't find it very engrossing.  It all seems like a superficial look at firefighting.You do get to learn things you probably didn't know about fire stations.  Like, there are different specialities among the the firemen.  You get a superficial look at the technology, but there is no real in depth look.The movie focuses on one fireman, his family life and his drive to be a fire fighter.  But, it is a superficial look.  You don't really understand why he was so driven.  You also don't understand what the connection is between him and his wife.  There is are a couple of deleted scenes that would have helped establish that, and I think the movie would have been better if there were included.The film does cover some interaction between the lead characters and the other fire fighters, but this is also superficial.  His best friend gets killed.  But, you don't realize who gets killed or that he was the best friend until they come out and tell you later.  You have no idea what the connection is between the two or that they were even friends.There are some real melodramatic fireman cliche's in the movie.  All the things you would expect:  death of friend, bad injury of another, family tensions, etc.The ending was dragged out too long, with a horrible song from Robbie Robertson (ex-leader of the band).  This might be the worst thing he has done.  It is one of those ballads you would hear from someone like Bryan Adams.Despite all this, the movie was entertaining throughout.  The movie didn't go overboard on the fire fighting cliches.  There was the one mean fireman, but this wasn't overplayed.  While there was some family strife, the wife was mostly supportive.  There were the pranks, but they weren't mean spirited.The fire fighting scenes were good, but not memorable.  They were not heart pounding, but were somewhat exciting.The extras are a 20 minute ""making of"" feature and 5 deleted scenes.  The movie would have been better if they left a couple of those scenes in.I liked that the film makers had the courage to delete the 9-11 scene.

Now it's not that these things are bad or anything like that, it's just I had very little interest in watching these basic parts that happens in every man's life.But as the story progressed and things got a little more dramatic, I started to see the bigger picture this film was trying to draw and I realized that this film is not only a simple tribute to firefighters, but it's a movie about life in general and how these simple, ordinary and common things are the moments that make a man's entire life and are what he is remembered by when he is gone.So by the end credits of the movie I was feeling very emotional about what I had just watched and I was really glad I watched it.Other than the storyline the film had some great performances from everyone in the movie and was well directed overall.",4,An emotionally charged film,1113177600,"04 11, 2005",2005,1673,"['first', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'Ladder', '49', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'film', 'rather', 'formulaic', 'presentation', 'sory.It', 'out', 'fireman', 'Jack', 'Morrison', 'getting', 'trapped', 'burning', 'building', 'trapped', 'fire', 'back', 'life', 'rookie', 'days', 'fireman', 'meeting', 'wife', 'having', 'kids', 'losing', 'comrades', 'firefighting', 'battles', 'segment', 'life', 'back', 'Jack', 'trapped', 'building', 'company', '49', 'try', 'rescue', 'him.Now', 'what', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'seemed', 'one', 'had', 'formulaic', 'start', 'just', 'basic', 'parts', 'Jack', 'life', 'hanging', 'out', 'bar', 'station', 'meeting', 'girls', 'grocery', 'store', 'things', 'seemed', 'highly', 'uninteresting', 'Now', 'not', 'things', 'are', 'bad', 'anything', 'just', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'interest', 'watching', 'basic', 'parts', 'man', 'life.But', 'story', 'progressed', 'things', 'got', 'little', 'more', 'dramatic', 'started', 'see', 'bigger', 'picture', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'draw', 'realized', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'simple', 'tribute', 'firefighters', 'movie', 'life', 'general', 'how', 'simple', 'ordinary', 'common', 'things', 'are', 'moments', 'make', 'man', 'entire', 'life', 'are', 'what', 'remembered', 'when', 'gone.So', 'end', 'credits', 'movie', 'was', 'feeling', 'very', 'emotional', 'what', 'had', 'just', 'watched', 'was', 'really', 'glad', 'watched', 'it.Other', 'storyline', 'film', 'had', 'great', 'performances', 'everyone', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'directed', 'overall']",Ladder 49

The song at the end ""Shine Your Light"" by Robbie Robertson is excellent and heartwarming powerful. It is in sync of the movie's message. The cinematography by James L. Carter (who also did the cinematography to Jay Russell's ""My Dog Skip"" (2000) & ""Tuck Everlasting"" (2002) is excellent. The film editing by Bud S. Smith (who also film edited ""Flashdance"" (1983), ""The Karate Kid"" (1984), & ""Darkman"" (1990) & M. Scott Smith (who also film edited ""The Crow"" (1994) is excellent.

I really felt connected to the characters to care about them, which doesn't happen in many movies, and I guess that's why I spent a fair amount of time blubbering into my boyfriend's shoulder. I like how Jack is flashing back over his life when he is trapped, I think it is more dramatic than going through the same sequence chronologically. Joaquin Phoenix gives a performance that will haunt me for a very long time, this is a career movie for him. Jacinda Barrett and John Travolta also give stirring performances.One thing kind of ticked me off though when Kennedy is outside and tells Jack he has to crawl around debris to a control room where the rescue team will rendezvous with him. Huh? The guy fell who knows how far, is hurt, in a fire without a mask and now he has to do that? But God love Jack, he does it without complaint, because that's how much he loves his job and respects Kennedy, who was basically his mentor and father-figure in the department.It doesn't have a happy ending, as young Linda's worst nightmare comes true, but it brings home the real dangers of the job and those that are sometimes left behind.

858025,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00063MAXQ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 9]","Joaquin Phoenix was on the cover of ""Entertainment Weekly"" in character for ""The Village"" in a successfully bait and switch for us to think that he was the hero in M. Night Shyamalan's last film.  Instead, it was Bryce Dallas Howard who was the heart and soul of that film and who should have been on the cover if something other that the publicity game was calling the shots.  I mention this because Phoenix should have been on the cover for his role in ""Ladder 49"" in which he is the soul of the film, with John Travolta being the heart (yes, Phoenix's character finds a wife, but the point is that the man is wedded to his job), although he will probably be on a cover or two when his role as Johnny Cash in ""I Walk the Line"" hits the big screen.The cinematic predecessor of Jay Russell's ""Ladder 49"" is Ron Howard's ""Backdraft,""and the common denominators in both films are the use of real fire rather than CGI and the emphasis on the dedication of the men who fight fires.  But ""Backdraft"" was a murder/arson mystery and ""Ladder 49"" is made in the wake of 9/11.  The big line of the film is when Travolta's character says, ""People are always asking me how is it that firefighters run into a burning building when everyone else is running out. Courage is the answer.""  It is a good line and certainly rings true, but I have to believe that everybody who hears it thinks not of the characters they have seen in this movie but those who ran into the World Trade Center and never came back out.The best thing about ""Ladder 49"" is that it puts faces on not only those firefighters who died on 9/11 but on the equally faceless public servants who work in Baltimore or any other major city (we are not quite in that league in terms of having the quantity and quality of fire calls depicted in the film, which is a good thing).  The story begins at the end and a massive fire in a Baltimore grain warehouse in which Jack Morrison (Phoenix) completes a rescue and then comes trapped in the burning building when the grain dust explodes.  We then go back to the first day the rookie firefighter walked into a firehouse and the hazing began as soon as he was through the door.  Captain Mike Kennedy (Travolta) is a third generation firefighter and a consummate professional.  There is a nice sequence at Jack's first fire where the rookie is working the ""pipe"" (he is the guy on the nozzle of the fire house spraying the water on the fire), and Kennedy is right behind him talking him through the job and teaching how it should be done.The film goes back and worth between the attempts to rescue Jack and his career as a firefighter, with the latter being entwined with his meeting, romancing, and marrying Linda (Jacinda Barrett).  The job is a mixture of triumph and tragedy, and there is a sense in which the climax of the film becomes not Jack's rescue but the point where he has the choice between moving from the engine to the ladder (search & rescue) or taking a desk job by going with Kennedy when he becomes a chief.  Obviously we know the decision he is going to make and chose the work over safety, but what is important is that we understand his decision and we appreciate the sacrifice.Another strength of the script by Lewis Colick is that it fleshes out the cast of supporting characters as well.  Not because they are a group of loveable eccentrics, but rather because they seem like a real group of guys.  Of course the actors went through a two-week course in firefighting, so authenticity is not a problem.  As for the ending, my only comment is that I thought the decision was obvious a lot earlier than that, but one of the points about ""Ladder 49"" is that the obvious decision to us so clearly goes against the grain for these men.",4,A cinematic testimonial to the courage of firefighters,1110326400,"03 9, 2005",2005,3747,"['Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'was', 'cover', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'character', 'Village', 'successfully', 'bait', 'switch', 'think', 'was', 'hero', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'last', 'film', 'Instead', 'was', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'who', 'was', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cover', 'something', 'other', 'publicity', 'game', 'was', 'calling', 'shots', 'mention', 'Phoenix', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cover', 'role', 'Ladder', '49', 'soul', 'film', 'John', 'Travolta', 'being', 'heart', 'yes', 'Phoenix', 'character', 'wife', 'point', 'man', 'wedded', 'job', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'cover', 'two', 'when', 'role', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Walk', 'Line', 'big', 'screen.The', 'cinematic', 'predecessor', 'Jay', 'Russell', 'Ladder', '49', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Backdraft', 'common', 'denominators', 'films', 'are', 'use', 'real', 'fire', 'rather', 'CGI', 'emphasis', 'dedication', 'men', 'who', 'fight', 'fires', 'Backdraft', 'was', 'murder/arson', 'mystery', 'Ladder', '49', 'made', 'wake', '9/11', 'big', 'line', 'film', 'when', 'Travolta', 'character', 'People', 'are', 'always', 'asking', 'how', 'firefighters', 'run', 'burning', 'building', 'when', 'everyone', 'else', 'running', 'out', 'Courage', 'answer', 'good', 'line', 'certainly', 'rings', 'true', 'have', 'believe', 'everybody', 'who', 'not', 'characters', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'who', 'ran', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'never', 'came', 'back', 'out.The', 'best', 'thing', 'Ladder', '49', 'not', 'only', 'firefighters', 'who', 'died', '9/11', 'equally', 'faceless', 'public', 'servants', 'who', 'work', 'Baltimore', 'other', 'major', 'city', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'league', 'terms', 'having', 'quantity', 'quality', 'fire', 'calls', 'depicted', 'film', 'good', 'thing', 'story', 'end', 'massive', 'fire', 'Baltimore', 'grain', 'warehouse', 'Jack', 'Morrison', 'Phoenix', 'rescue', 'then', 'trapped', 'burning', 'building', 'when', 'grain', 'dust', 'explodes', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'first', 'day', 'rookie', 'firefighter', 'walked', 'firehouse', 'hazing', 'began', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'door', 'Captain', 'Mike', 'Kennedy', 'Travolta', 'third', 'generation', 'firefighter', 'consummate', 'professional', 'nice', 'sequence', 'Jack', 'first', 'fire', 'where', 'rookie', 'working', 'pipe', 'guy', 'nozzle', 'fire', 'house', 'spraying', 'water', 'fire', 'Kennedy', 'right', 'talking', 'job', 'teaching', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'done.The', 'film', 'back', 'worth', 'attempts', 'rescue', 'Jack', 'career', 'firefighter', 'latter', 'being', 'entwined', 'meeting', 'romancing', 'marrying', 'Linda', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'job', 'mixture', 'triumph', 'tragedy', 'sense', 'climax', 'film', 'not', 'Jack', 'rescue', 'point', 'where', 'choice', 'moving', 'engine', 'ladder', 'search', 'rescue', 'taking', 'desk', 'job', 'going', 'Kennedy', 'when', 'chief', 'Obviously', 'know', 'decision', 'going', 'make', 'chose', 'work', 'safety', 'what', 'important', 'understand', 'decision', 'appreciate', 'sacrifice.Another', 'strength', 'script', 'Lewis', 'Colick', 'out', 'cast', 'supporting', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'Not', 'are', 'group', 'loveable', 'eccentrics', 'rather', 'seem', 'real', 'group', 'guys', 'course', 'actors', 'went', 'two-week', 'course', 'firefighting', 'authenticity', 'not', 'problem', 'ending', 'only', 'comment', 'thought', 'decision', 'was', 'obvious', 'lot', 'earlier', 'one', 'points', 'Ladder', '49', 'obvious', 'decision', 'so', 'clearly', 'grain', 'men']",Ladder 49
858026,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00063MAXQ,Lawyeraau,"[3, 3]","First and foremost, this is a drama, not an action film, about firefighters, with the focus on one firefighter in particular. The film tells the story about the life this one firefighter, whose life is revealed in flashback, when he finds himself in a bit of difficulty while fighting a fire and engaging in a rescue. That singular moment in time is grounded in the context of his life as a firefighter. While the film may be said to be somewhat formulaic and predictable, it does not take away from the fine acting, the great fire fighting sequences, and the poignant and funny moments that occur throughout the film. In many ways it is reflective of life itself, with some highs and lows, as well as a ready, steady core of reality in which all is grounded.The firefighter who finds himself in a quandary is Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix), a firefighter at a Baltimore firehouse. The viewer sees Jack in his rookie days as he is initiated into the brotherhood of firefighters and begins the bonding process with his fellow firefighters, whereby they become ""family"". Some of those bonding scenes are quite funny, especially the one involving his initial meeting with the then Captain of the firehouse, Mike Kennedy (John Travolta). Others are quite serious and poignant, as the dangers of the job are brought home to the viewer, especially when Jack loses a member of the brotherhood that is near and dear to him. The film shows, as the years go by, Jack's progression through the ranks from rookie to respected firefighter. It is clear that it is a job that he loves, despite the ever present danger to life.As the viewer sees Jack's professional life unfold, the viewer also catches glimpses into Jack's personal life, from the moment that he meets his future wife, Linda (Jacinda Barrett), to the moment of their wedding and the birth of their children, with the wife and children also becoming part of the larger firefighter family or brotherhood. The film also shows the tremendous pressure and stress that a firefighter's job can have on one's spouse and children with their ever present concern for the safety of that beloved firefighter. After all, firefighters go where others dare not, simply so that others may live. The film shows how firefighters and members of their families cope with this ever present sword of Damocles that hangs over their respective heads.Joaquin Phoenix, who is one of the finest young actors of his generation, gives a low key, but poignant, performance as the salt of the earth kind of guy who wants to do the best that he can for those whom he loves, in a job that he loves, with those with whom he loves working. He gives a quintessential portrayal of a working class guy for whom firefighting and family are concepts at the central core of his being. John Travolta gives a humorous and, at times, affecting performance as Mike Kennedy, the firefighting official who clearly is not above playing a practical joke on his firefighters but who pulls out all the stops to ensure that none are left behind when fighting a fire. Jacinda Barrett is effective in the role of Linda, the concerned wife who does her best to allay her fears and, over time, become supportive of her husband's chosen career. The rest of the supporting cast is equally effective in their respective roles.This is a film that those who would like to sneak a peek into the life of a firefighter will appreciate. It will certainly let the viewer see the everyday types of situations that may confront a firefighter, as well as enable the viewer to discern why firefighters form such close relationships with each other. After viewing this film, a viewer can certainly walk away with an understanding as to why firefighters are such a unique brotherhood and why they bond as they do. It takes a special person, indeed, to walk into a towering inferno. This film does firefighters proud, and my hat is certainly off to firefighters everywhere.

Joaquin Phoenix is cast as the young fireman. Jacinda Barrett is cast as the young fireman's wife.  The film spans a period of 10 years.  During this time we see the young couple meet, marry and have some very cute children.  We watch the time-worn clich&eacute; about how the wife worries about the husband and wants him to stop his dangerous life.  Naturally, he doesn't change though and he just gets braver and braver.  There's a lot of camaraderie and good-natured horseplay among the men.  But they all respect each other and it's a tight-knit group.  Eventually, our hero is trapped in a burning building with no way out. The plot is predictable.  And the acting is adequate.But this film is more than just about the plot.  It is about the fires.  And I must say I sat in that theater absolutely transfixed as I was thrust into what looked like the reality of it all.  I've seen other films and also have read about fires.  But this film brought me right there.  I was inside all the burning buildings depicted in the film.  I might not have felt the actual heat of the fires, but I did feel their unpredictability and the randomness in which tragedy can occur.

858032,A3L582MONQ56G9,B00063MAXQ,"M. Armstrong ""Trigger""","[4, 12]","This film is a color-by-numbers look at a Baltimore firehouse.  It is meant as a tribute to firefighters in the wake of 9/11 that will tug on the heartstrings of Americans who were touched by the efforts of the NYFD.The characters in this film all seem to have come from some generic scriptwriting textbook.  It doesn't help that many of the performances were mailed in either.  I can't say the acting was necessarily bad, it just wasn't anything special.  One notable exception, and pleasant surprise was the performance by former Real World London cast member, Jacinda.  She was the only actor in this movie that was able to breathe life into her character.  Sadly, her screen time was limited.  Meanwhile, Travolta and Phoenix seemed to be sleepwalking through their performances in spite of the fact that they both no doubt put everything they had into it.This is a film that wanted to make you cry and feel and gain a deep appreciation for firefighters.  Well, one would be hard-pressed to find an American who doesn't already have a deep and profound respect and admiration and appreciation for them.  Regardless, Ladder 49 misses its mark.  Perhaps it tried too hard.  In the end, I was more bored than anything, and I felt nothing for anyone.On a technical level, making movies with or about fire is really difficult and in that respect they did a decent job.  The fire looks hot.  Unfortunately, this isn't a special effects action film, it's a slice of life human drama.I didn't go into this expecting some big action movie or Backdraft 2 - I was well aware this was going to be a drama.  It wasn't really a bad movie, but it was also anything but good.  I gave it a 2/5 because it just misses every goal it set, but at the same time it wasn't a terrible film.  Some people will likely enjoy this movie and I'm sure there are people out there who will get emotional over it.  However, if someone does get emotional over it, I'd bet it was because they were drawing from personal ties to 9/11 or to a firefighter or some such thing rather than because the movie did what it was trying to do.As for the DVD... the transfer is decent and the 5.1 audio mix is good.  The video was clean with no artifacts that I could see, but it didn't blow me away... I think there's a little room for improvement.  DTS sound wouldn't hurt either.  Perhaps they'll release a superbit or something someday.  As it stands though, this DVD is more than good enough given the quality of the movie.  The menus are also pretty generic and boring - no surprise there.The extras include a 13 minute documentary about firefighters which includes interviews with cast members as well as actual firefighters.  It's basically more melodrama and pretty boring.  There's some making-of features here as well that is pretty interesting if you like to know about how they did the effects and how the actors trained for the fire scenes.There are also some equally dull deleted scenes (about 14 minutes worth) that look like they were pulled from a 4th generation vhs copy.  Audio commentary is also included by director and editor... I didn't listen to it because I didn't want to sit through the film again.Finally there's a music video for the boring and generic song ""shine your light"" by Robbie Robertson (even his name is generic).  It's just scenes from the film mixed with Robbie singing in various locations with Jacinda in a few of them.  Nothing remarkable about it.Is this worth purchasing?  Well, it's a good DVD for those who like the film enough.  If you haven't seen the film, I'd urge you to rent it first.  It's not something I'd ever need or want to see again.  If you're a big huge fan of firefighters, this item does milk the firefighter tribute thing quite a bit.  I would recommend you all check out Towering Inferno instead though because my uncle was in it as a stuntman and so was The Juice (before he allegedly murdered his wife).",2,"Generic, vapid and empty melodrama",1109894400,"03 4, 2005",2005,3930,"['film', 'color-by-numbers', 'look', 'Baltimore', 'firehouse', 'meant', 'tribute', 'firefighters', 'wake', '9/11', 'will', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'Americans', 'who', 'were', 'touched', 'efforts', 'NYFD.The', 'characters', 'film', 'seem', 'have', 'come', 'generic', 'scriptwriting', 'textbook', ""n't"", 'help', 'many', 'performances', 'were', 'mailed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'acting', 'was', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special', 'One', 'notable', 'exception', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'was', 'performance', 'former', 'Real', 'World', 'London', 'cast', 'member', 'Jacinda', 'was', 'only', 'actor', 'movie', 'was', 'able', 'breathe', 'life', 'character', 'Sadly', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'limited', 'Meanwhile', 'Travolta', 'Phoenix', 'seemed', 'be', 'sleepwalking', 'performances', 'spite', 'fact', 'doubt', 'put', 'everything', 'had', 'it.This', 'film', 'wanted', 'make', 'cry', 'feel', 'gain', 'deep', 'appreciation', 'firefighters', 'Well', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'find', 'American', 'who', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'deep', 'profound', 'respect', 'admiration', 'appreciation', 'Regardless', 'Ladder', '49', 'mark', 'Perhaps', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'end', 'was', 'more', 'bored', 'anything', 'felt', 'nothing', 'anyone.On', 'technical', 'level', 'making', 'movies', 'fire', 'really', 'difficult', 'respect', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'fire', 'hot', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'film', 'slice', 'life', 'human', 'drama.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'big', 'action', 'movie', 'Backdraft', '2', 'was', 'well', 'aware', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'drama', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'anything', 'good', 'gave', '2/5', 'just', 'goal', 'set', 'same', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'film', 'people', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'get', 'emotional', 'However', 'someone', 'get', 'emotional', ""'d"", 'bet', 'was', 'were', 'drawing', 'personal', 'ties', '9/11', 'firefighter', 'such', 'thing', 'rather', 'movie', 'did', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do.As', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'decent', '5.1', 'audio', 'mix', 'good', 'video', 'was', 'clean', 'artifacts', 'could', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'blow', 'away', 'think', 'little', 'room', 'improvement', 'DTS', 'sound', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'either', 'Perhaps', ""'ll"", 'release', 'superbit', 'something', 'someday', 'DVD', 'more', 'good', 'enough', 'given', 'quality', 'movie', 'menus', 'are', 'also', 'pretty', 'generic', 'boring', 'surprise', 'there.The', 'extras', 'include', '13', 'minute', 'documentary', 'firefighters', 'interviews', 'cast', 'members', 'as', 'well', 'actual', 'firefighters', 'basically', 'more', 'melodrama', 'pretty', 'boring', 'making-of', 'features', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'like', 'know', 'how', 'did', 'effects', 'how', 'actors', 'trained', 'fire', 'scenes.There', 'are', 'also', 'equally', 'dull', 'deleted', 'scenes', '14', 'minutes', 'worth', 'look', 'were', 'pulled', '4th', 'generation', 'vhs', 'copy', 'Audio', 'commentary', 'also', 'included', 'director', 'editor', 'did', ""n't"", 'listen', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'sit', 'film', 'again.Finally', 'music', 'video', 'boring', 'generic', 'song', 'shine', 'light', 'Robbie', 'Robertson', 'even', 'name', 'generic', 'just', 'scenes', 'film', 'mixed', 'Robbie', 'singing', 'various', 'locations', 'Jacinda', 'few', 'Nothing', 'remarkable', 'it.Is', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'Well', 'good', 'DVD', 'who', 'like', 'film', 'enough', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', ""'d"", 'urge', 'rent', 'first', 'not', 'something', ""'d"", 'ever', 'need', 'want', 'see', 'again', ""'re"", 'big', 'huge', 'fan', 'firefighters', 'item', 'milk', 'firefighter', 'tribute', 'thing', 'quite', 'bit', 'would', 'recommend', 'check', 'out', 'Towering', 'Inferno', 'instead', 'uncle', 'was', 'stuntman', 'so', 'was', 'Juice', 'allegedly', 'murdered', 'wife']",Ladder 49

Joaquin Phoenix in one of his best performances plays firefighter Jack Morrison who we first meet trapped in a pyrotechnical nightmare.  Via flashbacks, we trace Jack through his first day on the job through his current predicament.  Phoenix gives Jack a heroic foundation but also shows us his own doubts, his love for his job and his family.  John Travolta pulls his weight in a subtler performance as the fire chief, Mike Kennedy, who shows a real love for his firefighters and a sense of humor to boot.  Jacinda Barrett does a credible job as Morrison's wife, Linda, who professes the expected worry over Jack's dangerous profession, but also lets him know how proud she is of him, and she's behind him all the way.  Baltazar Getty, Robert Patrick, Tim Guinee, Billy Burke and Morris Chesnut are especially good in their supporting roles.  The special effects are seamless and some of the best since BACKDRAFT.  Director Jay Russell focuses on the character's heroics and although the end is predictable, it still packs a wallop.  ""Shine Your Light"" by Robbie Robertson is a lovely song and was sadly overlooked in this year's crummy Oscar nominations.

858040,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00063MAXQ,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[2, 2]","Where were you on September 11th, 2001? A little over three years ago, the world stood still as people from across the world witnessed one of the bloodiest and most horrific attacks on American soil by a foreign power. Images of the airplanes slamming into the World Trade Center towers, survivors trapped inside jumping to the ground below, flames rising from the wreckage of the Pentagon, and brave police and fire department workers searching the piles of debris for the remnants of their fallen comrades are ones that will forever be engraved in the minds of the courageous men and women of this beautiful country. And as the nation enters into the public debate of who is the better man to lead the United States in this tumultuous time in our history, one has to question whether the left side of the political spectrum has chosen to blot out the memories of this defining moment of our lives in order to conjure up a false September 10th mentality for political advantage or, to the more unlikely affect, to demonstrate the extremely short memories maintain. Whatever the case, we, as a nation, can not believe the foolish rantings of ""disingenuous filmmakers"" and their propaganda and simply ignore the memories of those that made the ultimate sacrifice - and further more to those that continue to lay their lives on the line for our protection.The story for Ladder 49 centers on the events in the life of a firefighter who finds himself trapped in a horrific blaze struggling to escape and return to his family. Jack Morrison, just one of several dedicate firefighters of Ladder 49, one of Maryland's most prestigious and courageous firehouses, has spent the last ten years risking his life in order to save others. Though he has much to be grateful for - a loving wife, two beautiful children, and a dedicated group of co-workers and friends - Jack can't put off the feeling that he may be taking too much of a chance with his line of work. When he first started off at the firehouse, training as a rookie, he couldn't wait to get the call and spring into action putting out blazes and feel that adrenaline pumping. Then after meeting his future wife, Linda, and getting married, he begins to slowly rethink his line of work after a series of tragic circumstances. During what seems like another normal fire, Jack has to coup with the loss of his best friend, and the brother of one of another firefighter, eventually taking on his fallen comrades duties as a Truckee, a far more dangerous job then working the fire hoses. After the birth of his two children, another comrade of Jack's has his face horrifically damaged in a split-second accident. He finds himself so emotionally drained by the event that he can barely bring himself to visit his injured comrade, let alone bring his wife along and having her worry further about him. Jack then begins to question himself over whether he still feels the same way about his job as he did nearly ten years ago or not and if he should taken the position of captain's aide that has been offered to him. When he decides to continue working as a firefighter and saving the lives of those that truly need him, he finds himself trapped in a tremendous blaze that could very well bring his life to a sudden halt. The story for Ladder 49 is simply nothing short of astounding. There are just so few words to accurately describe the vivid emotions presented through this film's brilliantly crafted script. The image of Jack Morrison lying on the ground surrounded by flames and debris immediately following his rapid freefall descent down several floors of the burning building conjured up some of the most fervent memories of the aftermath of September 11th - an effect the filmmakers definitively wanted crossing the minds of the audience. In order to fully realize the movie's heart-warming and inspiration message, one must see the film for themselves.Once again here is a clear demonstration that you don't need a tremendous amount of A-list talent, let alone a still not world renowned leading man, to create a truly emotionally loaded feature film to life. Joaquin Phoenix, who appeared earlier this year in the surprisingly disappointing The Village, without question immortalizes himself as a future leading man with his performance in this film. Though he had appeared in both Gladiator and Signs, two critically praised and publicly well-received blockbusters, Phoenix was known more as a co-star and failed to be seen in the form of a famous leading man up to this point. The entire performance of the film rests on Phoenix's shoulders, as the storyline focuses solely on the events in his characters life, and he never once faults in his emotionally dedicated role. John Travolta, whose career seems to have hit a bit of a slump as of late, returns in fantastic form with his role as Chief Kennedy, the captain of Ladder 49, who trains and watches over Phoenix's character over his ten year career. Though the film's primary focus is on Jack Morrison, the balanced mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute;e relationship demonstrated through the film's nearly two hour time span offers. And, in all respects, Travolta is the man who holds the firehouse together - he brings them together when they're fighting, comforts them when are at a loss, and lifts them up when they need it most - it may not be the most original character in the book but, hey, why mess with success? The only disappointing aspect of the film when concentrating on the area of casting was the lack of originality when it came to each individual background character but this can easily be overlooked once you realize that Phoenix's performance is the only one that is suppose to have resounding effects.Overall, Ladder 49 successfully draws Americans back to the emotionally draining days of three years ago when we saw the most courageous and dedicated individuals amongst us risk their lives in the pursuit of fulfilling their civic duty knowing full well that many of them weren't coming back. Though the issue of September 11th, and more specifically the deaths of the three-hundred and forty-three firefighters that were lost on that horrific day, is not dealt with specifically in this film, Ladder 49 does achieve its goal of bringing public awareness to the rigorous careers of those that put their lives on the line everyday to ensure our safety and by that creates renewed aspiration for its audience. There are those that are going to criticize the film for its lack of originality, which, frankly, is astounding considering a majority of critics praised Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow barely two weeks ago despite nearly the exact same flaw. Besides, any film that consistently and thoroughly has audience members either on the verge of crying or flat-out balling their eyes out, not only at its climatic ending but sporadically throughout the feature, should be given credit for pulling off an achievement that is so rare at the box office these days. At long last, firefighters are given the proper treatment on the silver-screen they have so long deserved, The job may not be the easiest, it may even be quite draining not only for them but for their loved ones as well, but, in the end, it is usually those occupations that turn out to be the most fulfilling because they know that they are doing something good in the world.",4,The Moose Hole - The

858041,A3M2O06MCHJG18,B00063MAXQ,"MiddleAgedReviewer ""M_A_R""","[6, 7]","Director Jay Russell has sculpted somewhat of a Frank Capra type tribute to the firefighter; the mostly unsung hero who isn't trying to be a hero, he (or she) is just doing the job they know and love.  Picture George Bailey running into a burning building in Bedford Falls; that's how I see Joaquin Phoenix in this film.  Quiet, stoic, family-oriented.  Devoted to a duty.You won't mistake the plot for one crafted by M. Night Shamalan.  It's straightforward, softly dramatic, with no real plot twists, save for the will-he-or-won't-he finale.  What powers this film is the simple evolution of a young rookie into a seasoned firefighter; his relationships with his wife and kids as well as with his comrades.  There are the same very-close-to-cliche dilemmas between husband and wife associated with other ""he's got a dangerous profession"" films (see the astronauts in Apollo 13 or the test pilots in The Right Stuff, the flyboys in Pearl Harbor, the bomb defuser in The English Patient, and many more), but screenwriter Lew Colick never abuses those themes.  The film flows with the consistancy of main character Jack Morrison's (Phoenix's) life.  Day by day.**SPOILER ALERT**  My only wish for this film was for the ending -- and skip forward a paragraph if you don't want any hint of what happens -- to have been different.  Sometimes, in such films, with such very high regard for the men and women of this profession, I wished for something I usually never wish for:  That Hollywood Ending.  **END OF SPOILER ALERT**Joaquin Phoenix is becoming an actor whose work I look forward to viewing.  His work in ""The Village"" was very good.  He has a knack of playing the soft-spoken and, as I said earlier, stoic roles, and it suits him.  John Travolta plays the one-of-the-boys fire chief, protecting, fatherly, loving and stern all at once, and it was a nice part for him; a very strong supporting role.  I agree with what one of the other reviewers noted; that it is nice to see him in these supporting roles rather that directly in the spotlight.  His charisma is so present that he spices the atmosphere surrounding his fellow actors.In short, Ladder 49 is a very nice popcorn drama for grown-ups.  It's not an edge-of-your-seat manly man flick, though it does have its action moments.  It is more of a fictional biography of one man and his ""two families.""

858042,AURZ4YQ270W3T,B00063MAXQ,Mike Freed,"[3, 3]","""Ladder 49"" is the kind of film that makes you want to bake up a whole lot of cookies, and take them to your local firehouse. The thing is, after watching ""Ladder 49,"" you realize that while the folks at your office would smile politely and say ""thanks,"" firefighters would probably take you on a tour of the firehouse, especially if your kids were with you, and would probably eat them with you as you walked.That sort of quality is at the heart of ""Ladder 49,"" a fine film about the kind of people who sign up to be firefighters. There's a great, working-guy mentality to firefighters, who've seen it all, but don't become hard-bitten or bitter about it. There's a simple, genuine, wholesome quality to these people, and ""Ladder 49"" succeeds in helping us understand them.The story centers around Jack (Joaquin Phoenix), who, as the film opens, is involved in fighting a nightmarish fire in a high-rise grain elevator. He aaves one trapped worker, but becomes trapped himself when the grain dust explodes. We then cut back to his first day as a rookie firefighter, and meet the guys at his firehouse, including his boss, Chief Kennedy (John Travolta), who's half-drunk and in shorts when we first meet him.But Kennedy sees that Jack has a talent for firefighting, and the film follows Jack as he fights his first fire, falls in love, marries, and has kids, and begins to have second thoughts about his career path when his buddies begin to get killed and maimed on the job. But he sucks it up and goes back, out of duty to his firehouse as much to the citizens he serves.Life in the firehouse seems to comprise mainly of long stretches with nothing to do, punctuated by emergency calls. During the lull times, the firefighters fill the time with relentless practical joking, pool, and good-natured ribbing. It's easy to see why firefighters stay on the job; who wouldn't love a job that consists mainly of hanging out with the guys, and helping people?Jack's backstory is intercut with his ""present day"" crisis in the burning grain elevator, and his company's struggle to save him. These sequences are handled well (though not as well, it must be said, as in Ron Howard's ""Backdraft""), and we see that these firefighters are not just guys ""jumping into a burning building,"" but professionals with serious dedication to the mission.Probably the greatest strength of ""Ladder 49"" is that it presents these firefighters as they are - not heroic, but just normal guys doing an incredibly difficult job with incredible heart. The film never lionizes its subjects, but rather paints their everyday existence with an almost detached respect.If nothing else, this film - coupled with the recent memory of 9/11 - will make you incredibly grateful for those guys down the street, ready to leave their warm camraderie and practical joking behind at a moment's notice, and risk their lives to save us all.What decent people these men (and women) are...and ""Ladder 49"" lets you get to know them with equal decency, respect, and gratitude.

858043,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00063MAXQ,mirasreviews,"[7, 11]","""Ladder 49"" is a drama about the lives and work of firefighters that will appeal to admirers of firefighters and fans of movies about fire. The fires in the film are not CGI. They are real, and the actors were really very close to the flames. External shots of fires were filmed in Baltimore, where the movie takes place. The city allowed filmmakers to set fire to a number of buildings, including a very big fire, complete with explosions, in the abandoned grain elevator in which the main character is trapped.Firefighter Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) is trapped inside a burning building when the floor collapses beneath him. As he waits for help from his colleagues, he drifts in and out of consciousness, remembering his life a firefighter from his first day as a rookie  with Engine 33. Jack's story is told in flashback. He recalls what made him love his job as a ""pipe man"" before transferring to Search & Rescue, how he met his wife (Jacinda Barrett), his relationship with his mentor Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta), and the effects of a dangerous job on himself and his family.Although ""Ladder 49"" has five fire episodes, including the spectacular fire at the grain elevator, the movie is very low-key. It's about the day-to-day lives of firefighters. The film spends a lot of time in a bar that the men frequent, at a wedding reception, a child's birthday party, and observing the firefighters' practical joking. These mundane scenes are punctuated by tragedy, when a firefighter is killed or injured on the job. The fault I find with the film is that the mundane scenes are too many. I realize that director Jay Russell is trying to contrast the ordinariness of the men's lives with the extraordinary dangers they face. But everyday life really is dull, and it makes the film longer than it should be. The central relationships -between Jack and Mike, Jack and his wife, and the group of firefighters- provide a cohesive narrative and thematic thread. Periodically returning to the grain warehouse fire keeps us interested in Jack's story and gives the film unified structure. ""Ladder 49"" is a great film for firefighters and fires, but don't expect excitement.The DVD: Bonus features include some making-of documentaries, a documentary about real Baltimore city firefighters, 5 deleted scenes, an audio commentary by director Jay Russell and editor Bud Smith, and a music video for ""Share Your Light"" by Robbie Robertson. ""The Making of Ladder 49"" (21 minutes) is a documentary in 3 parts, which may be viewed separately. The first part, ""On Location"" (5 1/2 minutes), includes interviews with the director, producers, actors, and writer Lewis Colick, in which they discuss choosing Baltimore as the location and the work of the actors. In the second part, ""The Academy: Training the Actors"" (7  minutes), the actors who played firefighters talk about their experiences training at Baltimore's Fire Academy. Their instructor, Lt. Mark Yant, is also interviewed. The third part, ""Anatomy of a Scene: The Warehouse Fire"" (8 1/2 minutes), discusses the technical challenges of creating and shooting the warehouse fire in a real building and of adding the sound later. ""Everyday Heroes"" (13 minutes) interviews a lot of Baltimore firemen and their families, who talk about why they became firefighters and the camaraderie among their colleagues. The audio commentary mostly addresses the technical aspects of creating and filming real fires with actors and crew in the middle of them, as well as sound effects and audio tracks that were all added in post-production. There is some discussion of firefighters, but this is largely like an expanded version of the ""Anatomy of a Scene"" documentary. Captioning in English is available for the movie.

So is the crew hanging tight during after-hours get-togethers.

Of the emergency-type movies out there, this is most realistic to me; altho occ. they went for the cheap laugh such as the confession scenes seemed to stretch it too far. Although, we, too often went for the cheap joke/thrill in my companies as well.The movie gives lay people a decent representation of life on this side of the coin. Being disabled from this sort of work and my having PTSD the movie did trigger some flashbacks, yet it was also worth the positive journey down memory lane for me.Great film about life in the crewhouse, on calls, after-hours hanging out as families, and even down to shopping at the grocery store while on duty.",5,from a former paramedic/firefighter's point of view...,1112745600,"04 6, 2005",2005,1356,"['thought', 'Ladder', '49', 'did', 'convincing', 'job', 'displaying', 'every-day', 'camraderie', 'things', 'station', 'joking', 'demented/dark', 'humor', 'realistic', 'crew', 'hanging', 'tight', 'after-hours', 'get-togethers', 'especially', 'thought', 'flashback', 'effect', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'character', 'recalling', 'memories', 'flashbacks', 'career', 'was', 'realistic', 'nescessary', 'element', 'film.I', 'became', 'disabled', 'due', 'career', 'well', 'day', 'memories', 'are', 'ever-present', 'are', 'gritty', 'harrowing', 'flashbacks', 'dying', 'death', 'scenes', 'also', 'life-saving', 'calls.Emergency', 'services', 'family', 'everyone', 'family', 'similar', 'roles', 'family', 'displayed', 'Ladder', '49', 'emergency-type', 'movies', 'there', 'most', 'realistic', 'altho', 'occ', 'went', 'cheap', 'laugh', 'such', 'confession', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'stretch', 'too', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'went', 'cheap', 'joke/thrill', 'companies', 'well.The', 'movie', 'lay', 'people', 'decent', 'representation', 'life', 'side', 'coin', 'Being', 'disabled', 'sort', 'work', 'having', 'PTSD', 'movie', 'did', 'trigger', 'flashbacks', 'was', 'also', 'worth', 'positive', 'journey', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'me.Great', 'film', 'life', 'crewhouse', 'calls', 'after-hours', 'hanging', 'out', 'families', 'even', 'down', 'shopping', 'grocery', 'store', 'duty']",Ladder 49

However, the story arc covers no new ground, and cannot really be described in any way as multilayered - what you see is what you get.  Having said that, the director treats these predictable scenes in a sensitive way that involves you more than you might expect.What you do get, is Joachin Phoenix' character injured and trapped in a large burning building, and as he waits for his rescue, we see his life unfold through flashbacks to key events, starting from when he first walks into the fire station as a probationary fire officer.  Told just that about the movie, you can probably guess where it goes... boy meets girl, boy marries girl, boy has first kid, boy has second kid, boy has bad things happen to colleagues, boy wonders if he is in the right job considering he now has family, boy realizes he loves his job and stays.  It's not particularly clever, and yet, at the end of the movie you will have an appreciation for the life of a fireman in a typical blue collar environment, which was surely the films goal in the first place.  John Travolta plays the father figure Captain of the station, adding little depth to the role, but Joachin Phoenix does a passable job, gaining plaudits at least for his willingness to get right into the thick of the action and look the part.  Apparently after training he became an honorary member of the firefighting team he trained with, even getting their tattoo.If anything else raises the film from mediocrity, it is the firefighting scenes.  Not just that that they have been created realistically, but that they have a real flavour of realism about them - these smack of realistic situations for firefighters, and not scenes that are chosen purely for dramatic value.  The effects thankfully shy away from cgi, and the sound mix helps add to a feeling of being `inside' the fire.  Best of all, the movie does not rely on these scenes to keep your interest, but they become part of the character drama.Interestingly, in the extras the deleted scenes do add some value - one plot line in particular which has one of the firefighters dealing with the loss of his brother through sinking into a spiral of drinking, shows both the emotional and mental strain of the job and the toll it takes, as well as the camaraderie of the firefighters that help him get through it.  Otherwise, the extras cover predictable ground, making of, tribute to firefighters etc.  Some of the scenes showing the cast going through firefighting school are moderately interesting.All in all, a modest success, but one that somehow you can't help feeling should have had more to it, given the talent involved.

For one it doesn't have that Hollywood feel, but an everyday sort of quality.  Not the typical action packed adventure, but the telling of real life drama.  A story told in flashback Jack Morrison (Phoenix) is trapped and cut off from his fellow firefighters in a 20-story building inferno.  You become the onlooker of his initiation into the brotherhood of firefighters, his career decisions, his family life, and the struggles he faces watching his fellow firefighters suffering injury and death.There is firemen bonding, rituals, rescues, pageantry, and everyday firehouse living.  You will laugh, hold your breath and cry.  My favorite scene occurs when Jack has to be lowered down the side of a high rise office building to rescue a trapped man.The supporting cast which includes John Travolta as Cap. Mike Kennedy and Jacinda Barrett as Linda Morrison are vital to the story.  He gives the perspective of a fellow firemen and she the perspective of a concerned wife.Once you view this film, you will have a whole new appreciation for what firefighters do everyday.

It's a routine, but nonetheless rousing, film in which Jack (Joaquin Phoenix) reminisces about his life as he lies trapped in a burning building as his fellow firefighters struggle to get to him.  At times, Ladder 49 can be a bit hokey with the similar story elements that are plenty apparent (such as the concern from Jack's wife over the lack of safety of what he does for a living), and at times it is predictable, but the film's ending packs a good punch.  The film is an excellent showcase for Phoenix as he gives a great performance as an unselfish and underappreciated hero, while John Travolta provides a just as great performance as Jack's mentor and firehouse captain, while the film is capably directed by Jay Russell.  The rest of the finally chosen cast includes Robert Patrick, an underused Balthazar Getty, Jay Hernandez, Tim Guinee, and Morris Chestnut, who it is great to see in a movie that doesn't have Steven Seagle in it.  It's not the character driven drama that Ron Howard's Backdraft was, but Ladder 49 is still a worthwhile tribute to the bravery and unselfishness displayed by true American heroes.",4,"Routine, but rousing, firefighter yarn",1109548800,"02 28, 2005",2005,1247,"['Ladder', '49', 'less', 'film', 'firefighters', 'more', 'tribute', 'men', 'who', 'put', 'lives', 'line', 'save', 'others', 'routine', 'nonetheless', 'rousing', 'film', 'Jack', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'life', 'trapped', 'burning', 'building', 'fellow', 'firefighters', 'struggle', 'get', 'times', 'Ladder', '49', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'hokey', 'similar', 'story', 'elements', 'are', 'plenty', 'apparent', 'such', 'concern', 'Jack', 'wife', 'lack', 'safety', 'what', 'living', 'times', 'predictable', 'film', 'ending', 'packs', 'good', 'punch', 'film', 'excellent', 'showcase', 'Phoenix', 'great', 'performance', 'unselfish', 'underappreciated', 'hero', 'John', 'Travolta', 'just', 'great', 'performance', 'Jack', 'mentor', 'firehouse', 'captain', 'film', 'capably', 'directed', 'Jay', 'Russell', 'rest', 'finally', 'chosen', 'cast', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'underused', 'Balthazar', 'Getty', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'Tim', 'Guinee', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'who', 'great', 'see', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'Steven', 'Seagle', 'not', 'character', 'driven', 'drama', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Backdraft', 'was', 'Ladder', '49', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'tribute', 'bravery', 'unselfishness', 'displayed', 'true', 'American', 'heroes']",Ladder 49
858054,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B00063MAXQ,Nicholas Carroll,"[4, 5]","I looked forward to seeing this film, though I didn't expect it to amount to much. I never saw ""Backdraft"", so I can't compare the two...but this film struck me in a way I didn't expect. I actually cried when the movie was over (it was that powerful!). Very few movies actually bring me to tears (only ""Casualties of War"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Field of Dreams"" and ""The Passion"" have that ""honor""), so that was quite a feat.I loved how the film played along two story lines...the action with the big warehouse fire that opens the film, and the backstory, as Joaquin Phoenix thinks back over his life, in a sort of ""life review"". We see episodes from when he first showed up at the firehouse to start his job. I loved the pranks that guys played on one another. Being a veteran of the Navy, I found those little things quite accurate in how guys interract with one another, testing the limits of one's sense of humor. I also liked the detail of seeing rats scurry down the stairs to get away from the fire. Its small details like that which really enhanced the authenticity of the film for me.The film shows how the dangers of the job can strain a marriage and scar children with worry, how accidents can happen that change people's lives, and how the guys stick together as a team. Firefighting is one of those jobs that will never go out of existence, so its important work, at somewhat little pay and benefits. After 9/11, a film like this needed to be made, and several characters made the point throughout the film: what possesses a guy to run into a burning building when everyone is running out?I loved the music in this film, both the score and the pop songs that play in various scenes. I'd recommend the soundtrack as well. When the film reaches its climax, I was stunned by the direction it took, the bravery of the filmmakers to go in that direction, and impressed by the overall respect and tribute this film ultimately shows to our finest public servants. This is a film worth watching and owning.

The direction of Jay Russell (""Tuck Everlasting"") is nothing short of dynamic or triumphant! The performances of superstars Joaquin Phoenix (""Signs"", ""The Village"") and John Travolta (""The Punisher"", ""Face/Off"") were tour de force and instantly unforgettable ones at that! Joining them are Jacinda Barrett (""The Human Stain""), Morris Chestnut (""Half Past Dead""), Robert Patrick (""Terminator 2: Judgment Day""), Balthazar Getty (""Deuces Wild""), and Billy Burke (""Along Came A Spider"") in excellent supporting performances!""Ladder 49"" introduces us to the life of Jack Morrison (Phoenix), a firefighter for the Baltimore City Fire Department. Jack is assigned to Fire Station 33 as a pipe-man for Ladder 49 (Note: The pipe-man holds the water hose nozzle and sprays water onto the fire.) As a new probationary firefighter, Jack is assigned all the little jobs at the firehouse. Station 33 Captain Mike Kennedy (Travolta), and the other veteran firefighters (including Patrick, Chestnut, Getty, and Burke) love to play jokes on the new rookies, including Jack. Captain Kennedy takes Jack under his wing to make him the best firefighter in the city. Time passes, and Jack is now a seasoned veteran on the rescue team. Ladder 49 has been called on a four-alarm fire to a burning 20-story building. Kennedy, now promoted to Fire Chief, is in command of the fire. Jack and the rescue team brave the fire to rescue anyone trapped inside. They save several people, and Jack continues to search for others. Jack finds a man and lowers him to safety, just before the floor collapses around him. Jack falls through the building into the middle of the inferno, and is rendered unconscious. When he awakens, Jack is able to radio to his men that he is alive. Now Jack is the one who needs to be rescued. Chief Kennedy coordinates the effort to save Jack. Awaiting rescue, Jack begins to relive his life with his wife Linda (Barrett) and kids, and his career through flashbacks.Where ""Ladder 49"" departs from the ""Backdraft"" mold is in the way it approaches its working-class characters. Director Russell shows, through Jack, that these are unquestionably brave men who believe in brotherhood and family, but hold them second to the thrill of fighting flames. Russell does a superb job capturing the blue-collar feel of ""Ladder 49"", with its portrayals of marital stress, male bonding, and neighborhood fire fighting in Baltimore. The audience is made to feel a part of the team, with Russell even going that extra mile and giving the crowds a POV shot of a fireman sliding down a brass pole! OK, so maybe that's a little much, but the rest of ""Ladder"" finds an emotional core to latch onto, deeply feeling the characters' plights, and investing a heartfelt interest in their fates.Most of the reason why ""Ladder"" resonates so much is the cast, led by a tender, gripping performance from Joaquin Phoenix. Phoenix has a tough role; he must convey ten years of character growth in just under two hours, which has sent lesser actors screaming out of the business. Phoenix navigates these heady waters with confidence, starting off as Jack in his shy, newbie glow as a rookie fireman, and nurturing him towards adulthood, where he starts a family and searches for more responsibility at his firehouse. Phoenix plays the role with elegance, bringing Jack from mousy boy to confident man without the change feeling forced. It's a tremendous performance from Phoenix. Also welcome is John Travolta (coming from a villainous turn in last April's ""The Punisher""), who, in a very un-Travolta move, seems content to stand in the background for most of the film, only occasionally stepping up to deliver a speech or two (or dance, with Jacinda Barrett), though they are ace speeches. A nice supporting turn that he should look into more often.And ""Ladder 49"" doesn't disappoint when it comes time to get audience into the fire. Russell stages these moments well, delivering on the promise of thrills and curiosity that goes into fighting fires. However, these sequences do not define what makes ""Ladder"" such a special film. There's a deeper story here, which involves a healthy dose of tragedy that grabs you faster than any orange ball of flame ever could, and that's the best way to dramatize the hard work of a firefighter. It's not the hardware, but the heart, courage, and loyalty that ""Ladder 49"" captures so well.In conclusion, one line in the movie states it all: ""Everyone is running out of a burning building and only the firefighters are running into the fire."" ""Ladder 49"" shows how brave our firefighters are and why we should honor them. ""Ladder 49"", without a doubt, is an instant DVD must-have when released!",5,"The most heartfelt and compelling film since ""Backdraft""!!",1096848000,"10 4, 2004",2004,4834,"['Movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'Ladder', '49', 'one', 'most', 'thrilling', 'powerful', 'motion', 'pictures', 'ever', 'made', '1991', 'Backdraft', 'direction', 'Jay', 'Russell', 'Tuck', 'Everlasting', 'nothing', 'short', 'dynamic', 'triumphant', 'performances', 'superstars', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Signs', 'Village', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Punisher', 'Face/Off', 'were', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'instantly', 'unforgettable', 'ones', 'Joining', 'are', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'Human', 'Stain', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'Half', 'Past', 'Dead', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Terminator', '2', 'Judgment', 'Day', 'Balthazar', 'Getty', 'Wild', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'Along', 'Came', 'A', 'Spider', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Ladder', '49', 'introduces', 'life', 'Jack', 'Morrison', 'Phoenix', 'firefighter', 'Baltimore', 'City', 'Fire', 'Department', 'Jack', 'assigned', 'Fire', 'Station', '33', 'pipe-man', 'Ladder', '49', 'Note', 'pipe-man', 'water', 'hose', 'nozzle', 'sprays', 'water', 'fire', 'new', 'probationary', 'firefighter', 'Jack', 'assigned', 'little', 'jobs', 'firehouse', 'Station', '33', 'Captain', 'Mike', 'Kennedy', 'Travolta', 'other', 'veteran', 'firefighters', 'including', 'Patrick', 'Chestnut', 'Getty', 'Burke', 'love', 'play', 'jokes', 'new', 'rookies', 'including', 'Jack', 'Captain', 'Kennedy', 'Jack', 'wing', 'make', 'best', 'firefighter', 'city', 'Time', 'Jack', 'now', 'seasoned', 'veteran', 'rescue', 'team', 'Ladder', '49', 'been', 'called', 'four-alarm', 'fire', 'burning', '20-story', 'building', 'Kennedy', 'now', 'promoted', 'Fire', 'Chief', 'command', 'fire', 'Jack', 'rescue', 'team', 'brave', 'fire', 'rescue', 'anyone', 'trapped', 'inside', 'save', 'several', 'people', 'Jack', 'search', 'others', 'Jack', 'man', 'safety', 'just', 'floor', 'Jack', 'building', 'middle', 'inferno', 'rendered', 'unconscious', 'When', 'Jack', 'able', 'radio', 'men', 'alive', 'Now', 'Jack', 'one', 'who', 'be', 'rescued', 'Chief', 'Kennedy', 'effort', 'save', 'Jack', 'Awaiting', 'rescue', 'Jack', 'relive', 'life', 'wife', 'Linda', 'Barrett', 'kids', 'career', 'flashbacks.Where', 'Ladder', '49', 'departs', 'Backdraft', 'mold', 'way', 'working-class', 'characters', 'Director', 'Russell', 'shows', 'Jack', 'are', 'unquestionably', 'brave', 'men', 'who', 'believe', 'brotherhood', 'family', 'hold', 'second', 'thrill', 'fighting', 'flames', 'Russell', 'superb', 'job', 'capturing', 'blue-collar', 'feel', 'Ladder', '49', 'portrayals', 'marital', 'stress', 'male', 'bonding', 'neighborhood', 'fire', 'fighting', 'Baltimore', 'audience', 'made', 'feel', 'part', 'team', 'Russell', 'even', 'going', 'extra', 'mile', 'giving', 'crowds', 'POV', 'shot', 'fireman', 'sliding', 'down', 'brass', 'pole', 'OK', 'so', 'maybe', 'little', 'much', 'rest', 'Ladder', 'emotional', 'core', 'latch', 'deeply', 'feeling', 'characters', 'plights', 'investing', 'heartfelt', 'interest', 'fates.Most', 'reason', 'why', 'Ladder', 'so', 'much', 'cast', 'led', 'tender', 'gripping', 'performance', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Phoenix', 'tough', 'role', 'must', 'convey', 'ten', 'years', 'character', 'growth', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'sent', 'lesser', 'actors', 'screaming', 'business', 'Phoenix', 'heady', 'waters', 'confidence', 'starting', 'off', 'Jack', 'shy', 'newbie', 'glow', 'rookie', 'fireman', 'nurturing', 'towards', 'adulthood', 'where', 'family', 'searches', 'more', 'responsibility', 'firehouse', 'Phoenix', 'role', 'elegance', 'bringing', 'Jack', 'mousy', 'boy', 'confident', 'man', 'change', 'feeling', 'forced', 'tremendous', 'performance', 'Phoenix', 'Also', 'welcome', 'John', 'Travolta', 'coming', 'villainous', 'turn', 'last', 'April', 'Punisher', 'who', 'very', 'un-Travolta', 'move', 'content', 'stand', 'background', 'most', 'film', 'only', 'occasionally', 'stepping', 'up', 'deliver', 'speech', 'two', 'dance', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'are', 'ace', 'speeches', 'nice', 'supporting', 'turn', 'should', 'look', 'more', 'often.And', 'Ladder', '49', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'when', 'time', 'get', 'audience', 'fire', 'Russell', 'moments', 'well', 'delivering', 'promise', 'thrills', 'curiosity', 'fighting', 'fires', 'However', 'sequences', 'do', 'not', 'define', 'what', 'Ladder', 'special', 'film', 'deeper', 'story', 'here', 'healthy', 'dose', 'tragedy', 'grabs', 'faster', 'orange', 'ball', 'flame', 'ever', 'could', 'best', 'way', 'dramatize', 'hard', 'work', 'firefighter', 'not', 'hardware', 'heart', 'courage', 'loyalty', 'Ladder', '49', 'captures', 'so', 'well.In', 'conclusion', 'one', 'line', 'movie', 'Everyone', 'running', 'out', 'burning', 'building', 'only', 'firefighters', 'are', 'running', 'fire', 'Ladder', '49', 'how', 'brave', 'firefighters', 'are', 'why', 'should', 'honor', 'Ladder', '49', 'doubt', 'instant', 'DVD', 'must-have', 'when', 'released']",Ladder 49
858056,A2959PY4ZOCXOH,B00063MAXQ,Nick,"[2, 4]","""Ladder 49"" is one of the most emotionally powerful and touching movies I've ever seen!!! I love the rawness and authenticity of it, depicting the lives and tasks of everyday firefighters (rescuing people, working overtime on holidays and hard weather conditions, doing grocery shopping, etc.)There were times I totally forgot that this was only a movie. The theme is very clearly illustrated in this movie that ""a bond forged by fire is never broken.""John Travolta is good for the supporting actor role playing the Captain but the real asset in this film is Joaquin Phoenix... He does an excellent job portraying Baltimore City firefighter, Jack Morrison, and his superb acting ability makes the film what it is today.The setting of the film is great, highlighting all the important aspects of the firefighter's life during a ten year span: from his first day on the job, his engagement, his marriage, his children, his professional triumphs and successes and sadly, his downfall.This film also includes humor in several instances to release some of the tension: the main character is greeted by a guard dog on the first day of his job, he forgets his boots in the firehouse, the first day orientation, the grocery shop experience when he met his wife, the orientation for future firefighters he conducts, and the goose in the locker were pretty neat.There were times I felt very proud for the firefighter: when he was extinguishing the fire on his first day, meeting his future wife, having two children, saving a man from a skyscrapper while they were hanging from a rope, saving the girl on Christmas day, getting honored for rescuing her, rescuing the factory worker during the catastrophic factory fire. His devotion, dedication and passion for his job were incomparable.There were 5 times that I felt very sorry and pity for the main character...and wished I was there for him in such difficult times:1) When his co-worker and good friend passes away in the fire and then does his best to replace him, transfering from Engine to Ladder.2) When he came home and when his wife saw him dangling from a rope on television3) When he had to pay a hospital visit to his other co-worker that got burned in the steam... and there were times in the hospital where he wasn't sure if he was able to go through it or not4) When he had to explain to his son the dangers of steam and how his son doesn't want him getting hurt anymore (it was very difficult for a parent to respond to that question)5) When he told the Captain to tell his wife, ""he loves her"" (in the final scene of his demise) was just sad and painful to watch.I believe that John Travolta's character did an excellent job on the eulogy in the ending scene, praising the life of the firefighter and honoring him the way he rightfully deserves. The tearjerking tribute was very well done.Overall, this movie is OUTSTANDING!!!! 5 stars easily. After watching it you will come across emotions that you never knew were there. It made me appreciate my local Fire Department a whole lot more and I gained more respect for them for risking their lives everyday for our country. How Joaquin Phoenix and the film itself didn't get any Oscar and Golden Globe nominations is beyond me. It is the best movie that came out in 2004 and one of my all time favorites.

And he is the type of man other men SHOULD want to be...dedicated to helping others and being a loving & devoted husband and father...not being obssesed with money and materialistic items!Adam Kennedy (John Travolta), first as Jack's firehouse Captain, then later as his Battalion Chief, is also excellent as Jack's mentor, friend and his children's Godfather.Jack's wife (played by the stunningly beautiful Jacinda Barrett) is a fun-loving, playful, yet sweet, romantic and very loving wife and mother who is worried about the highly dangerous rescue work Jack performs.The supporting cast of firefighter comrades is excellent. You can see that the ""guys"" are like a family, and are willing to sacrifice their lives for each other.""Ladder 49"" is a ""feel good"" movie that will have you laughing, crying at times (maybe even some of you ""macho"" men!), watching with awe and amazement, and fill you with a sense of great respect for firefighters...all at the same time.Due to some (bloodless) scenes of death and disfigurment, the film may not be suitable for younger children. But for you parents, if you think your children can deal with these scenes, Ladder 49 is a movie that can make a wonderful & lasting impression on them.The world needs more people like Jack Morrison!",5,Fitting Tribute to Everyday Heros,1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,2341,"['three', 'major', 'motion', 'pictures', 'have', 'focused', 'heroics', 'firefighters', 'Towering', 'Inferno', '1974', 'Backdraft', '1991', 'Ladder', '49', '2004', 'LADDER', '49', 'doubt', 'most', 'realistic', 'heartfelt', 'tribute', 'professional', 'personal', 'lives', 'firefighters.While', 'people', 'especially', 'men', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'touch', 'own', 'emotions', 'may', 'find', 'much', 'film', 'mushy', 'Ladder', '49', 'what', 'REAL', 'MAN', 'unselfish', 'devotion', 'community', 'wife', 'children.Following', '10', 'years', 'life', 'rookie', 'firefighter', 'hardened', 'veteran', 'rescue', 'man', 'as', 'well', 'courtship', 'marriage', 'birth', 'children', 'see', 'main', 'role', 'Jack', 'Morrison', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'man', 'who', 'helping', 'others', 'time', 'need', 'loving', 'devoted', 'husband', 'father.The', 'fire', 'scenes', 'are', 'most', 'realistic', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'also', 'help', 'show', 'bravery', 'dedication', 'compassion', 'Jack', 'strangers', 'fellow', 'firefighters.Jack', 'Morrison', 'type', 'man', 'most', 'women', 'would', 'want', 'marry', 'raise', 'family', 'type', 'man', 'other', 'men', 'SHOULD', 'want', 'be', 'dedicated', 'helping', 'others', 'being', 'loving', 'devoted', 'husband', 'father', 'not', 'being', 'obssesed', 'money', 'materialistic', 'items', 'Adam', 'Kennedy', 'John', 'Travolta', 'first', 'Jack', 'firehouse', 'Captain', 'then', 'later', 'Battalion', 'Chief', 'also', 'excellent', 'Jack', 'mentor', 'friend', 'children', 'Godfather.Jack', 'wife', 'played', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'fun-loving', 'playful', 'yet', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'very', 'loving', 'wife', 'mother', 'who', 'worried', 'highly', 'dangerous', 'rescue', 'work', 'Jack', 'performs.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'firefighter', 'comrades', 'excellent', 'can', 'see', 'guys', 'are', 'family', 'are', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'lives', 'other', 'Ladder', '49', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'crying', 'times', 'maybe', 'even', 'macho', 'men', 'watching', 'awe', 'amazement', 'fill', 'sense', 'great', 'respect', 'firefighters', 'same', 'time.Due', 'bloodless', 'scenes', 'death', 'disfigurment', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'suitable', 'younger', 'children', 'parents', 'think', 'children', 'can', 'deal', 'scenes', 'Ladder', '49', 'movie', 'can', 'make', 'wonderful', 'lasting', 'impression', 'them.The', 'world', 'more', 'people', 'Jack', 'Morrison']",Ladder 49

Given that it takes place in Baltimore instead of New York City, it'd be kind of hard to incorperate the attacks.  But when this film came out back in 2004, it served as the perfect reminder that heroes aren't just the brave men and women who entered the towers on that September day in 2001, many of them making the ultimate sacrifice so that others may live, but that heroes are any firefighter who doesn't hesitate to jump on their rig at the sound of the alarm, ready to face whatever emergency situation they're headed for.  It's no big-budget action flick and not a billion-dollar drama, but that does not detract from this great film and it's important message.

858065,A29R3O02O0PON4,B00063MAXQ,"Razr Maxx ""Metal Head""","[1, 1]","Ladder 49 tells the story of one fireman (Joaquim Phoenix) as he joins the department as a ""probie"" and advances in experience and bravery in the Baltimore City Fire Department (BCFD), except it is told through flashbacks of sort.At the beginning of the movie, we see the main conflict of the movie.  A large 15-story or so abandoned grain mill on the docks of Baltimore Harbor catches fire and ""Engine 33"" is called to action.  Engine 33?  Yes, the firehouse unit is Engine 33, its ladder truck (Fire & Rescue Unit) is ""Ladder 49"".  In this ""battle"" our main character (Joaquim Phoenix) finds himself in a bit of a pinch, if you will.  We then follow his journey through the department from his probie days to a veteran firefighter through, like I said, flashbacks.  It's a very interesting way of editing this film.  Instead of time lapsed story telling in a chronological manner, we start off by seeing, what ultimately, is the end for our main hero.In the flashbacks, we see him growing as a fireman as they get called to many fires as some of his fellow firemen get killed or seriously injured.  We also see him develop a love interest into a full blown family with two kids.  Like I said, the flashbacks tell a story in severe time lapse.  The whole story must've taken place over a period of at least 5 years or more, because one of the deleted scenes is one of 9/11.  Deleted scenes?  How would I know about that 2 weeks before release date?  A litte birdy at Amazon.com told me so. ;)Anyway, about the DVD.  Great little DVD.  The transfer is a nice, if not a little grainy 1.85 anamorphic transfer.  I say a little grainy, because it was probably intentional.  Oh don't get me wrong, it's a clean tranfer, but it appears the movie was shot with a bit of a documentary look to it.  The sound is superb.  Coming in a DD 5.1 track that claims that it is an ""enhanced track for home theaters"", it really has some nice directional effects that makes the fire scenes sound like the fire is all around you with panning effects from front to rear.Included are a couple nice little features.  A 22-minute ""Making of"" special split into 4 smaller segments with a Play All feature.  Very informative docu.  No CG fire in this film.  What you see is real.  Then we have a 13 minute feature called ""Everyday Heroes"" that tells the story of real-life Baltimore firemen.  Then 13-minutes of deleted scenes, one of which is the 1.5 minute '9/11' scene that I previously mentioned.  Rounding out the special features is a audio commentary by the director Jay Russell and editor Bud Smith.So in the end, we have a nice little DVD that could be used as a demo disc for your HT system.  If you liked Backdraft, pick up Ladder 49.  But I warn you, it's a bit of a tear jerker at some points because this film focuses on the heroism of everyday firemen as opposed to Backdraft's internal affairs corruption.",4,As good if not better than 1991's Backdraft.,1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,2895,"['49', 'story', 'one', 'fireman', 'Joaquim', 'Phoenix', 'department', 'probie', 'advances', 'experience', 'bravery', 'Baltimore', 'City', 'Fire', 'Department', 'BCFD', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'sort.At', 'beginning', 'movie', 'see', 'main', 'conflict', 'movie', 'large', '15-story', 'so', 'abandoned', 'grain', 'mill', 'docks', 'Baltimore', 'Harbor', 'catches', 'fire', 'Engine', '33', 'called', 'action', 'Engine', '33', 'Yes', 'firehouse', 'unit', 'Engine', '33', 'ladder', 'truck', 'Fire', 'Rescue', 'Unit', 'Ladder', '49', 'battle', 'main', 'character', 'Joaquim', 'Phoenix', 'bit', 'pinch', 'will', 'then', 'follow', 'journey', 'department', 'probie', 'days', 'veteran', 'firefighter', 'said', 'flashbacks', 'very', 'interesting', 'way', 'editing', 'film', 'Instead', 'time', 'lapsed', 'story', 'telling', 'chronological', 'manner', 'start', 'off', 'seeing', 'what', 'ultimately', 'end', 'main', 'hero.In', 'flashbacks', 'see', 'growing', 'fireman', 'get', 'called', 'many', 'fires', 'fellow', 'firemen', 'get', 'killed', 'seriously', 'injured', 'also', 'see', 'develop', 'love', 'interest', 'full', 'blown', 'family', 'two', 'kids', 'said', 'flashbacks', 'tell', 'story', 'severe', 'time', 'lapse', 'whole', 'story', 'must', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'place', 'period', 'least', '5', 'years', 'more', 'one', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'one', '9/11', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'How', 'would', 'know', '2', 'weeks', 'release', 'date', 'litte', 'birdy', 'Amazon.com', 'told', 'so', 'Anyway', 'DVD', 'Great', 'little', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'nice', 'not', 'little', 'grainy', '1.85', 'anamorphic', 'transfer', 'say', 'little', 'grainy', 'was', 'probably', 'intentional', 'Oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'clean', 'tranfer', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'bit', 'documentary', 'look', 'sound', 'superb', 'Coming', 'DD', '5.1', 'track', 'enhanced', 'track', 'home', 'theaters', 'really', 'nice', 'directional', 'effects', 'fire', 'sound', 'fire', 'panning', 'effects', 'front', 'rear.Included', 'are', 'couple', 'nice', 'little', 'features', '22-minute', 'Making', 'special', 'split', '4', 'smaller', 'segments', 'Play', 'All', 'feature', 'Very', 'informative', 'docu', 'CG', 'fire', 'film', 'What', 'see', 'real', 'Then', 'have', '13', 'minute', 'feature', 'called', 'Everyday', 'Heroes', 'story', 'real-life', 'Baltimore', 'firemen', 'Then', '13-minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'one', '1.5', 'minute', '9/11', 'scene', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'Rounding', 'out', 'special', 'features', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Jay', 'Russell', 'editor', 'Bud', 'Smith.So', 'end', 'have', 'nice', 'little', 'DVD', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'demo', 'disc', 'HT', 'system', 'liked', 'Backdraft', 'pick', 'up', 'Ladder', '49', 'warn', 'bit', 'tear', 'jerker', 'points', 'film', 'heroism', 'everyday', 'firemen', 'opposed', 'Backdraft', 'internal', 'affairs', 'corruption']",Ladder 49

The movie really focused more on the comraderie of the firefighters, which was a good thing considering that they seem to spend more time with each other than their own families, and in essence, are all each other have during the dangerous calls they must respond to regularly.  John Travolta was his usual self as the fire chief.  He was witty, funny, and emotionally powerful.  Robert Patrick and Morris Chestnut were also very good.  The movie also focused on the strain being a firefighter puts on their families as well.  The DVD extras was also great.

Let's face it, the person running into the burning building when everyone else is desperately trying to get out is going to be a hero in the eyes of many, and in ""Ladder 49,"" directed by Jay Russell and starring Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta, it is the hero and that sense of heroism that is presented and explored.The film follows the career of fireman Jack Morrison (Phoenix) from his rookie days through the following years as he establishes himself as a veteran of the firehouse, all under the tutelage of Captain Mike Kennedy (Travolta), who is always on hand to listen, question and impart the wisdom of age and experience to Jack, especially at pivotal times in his life.Over a period of time, Jack learns the ropes, develops his firefighting skills, matures and, along the way, learns about life and love.  When he meets an attractive young woman in a grocery store, Linda (Jacinda Barrett), and sparks fly, it isn't hard to figure out where this part of the story is going.Visually, the film is stunning at times:  The fires are spectacular, you can fairly feel the heat from the flames, which is bound to instill in one admiration for the firefighters who risk it all in the performance of their duties.  It gives a perspective, as well, to the way living with danger binds them together in a special way.  On the other hand, the way in which Russell presents this bonding also gives the impression that these are people who somehow live apart from the commoners, that the air they breathe is perhaps a bit more rarefied than what is available to the rest of us.The flaw of what is essentially a decent film can be placed directly in the lap of the director, who makes the mistake of putting his heroes on a pedestal right out of the gate, for no other reason than the fact that they are firemen, and in doing so he allows what could have been a riveting drama to lapse into unnecessary melodrama, which very nearly sinks the ship early on.  He makes the camaraderie of the firehouse, for instance, an exercise in cliche, while allowing his actors to struggle with the development of their characters.Phoenix gives a passable performance as Jack, but Travolta comes across as an actor playing a role the way he ""thinks"" it should be played, rather than creating a real identity for Mike, and Russell lets him get away with it.  In a similar role, in 1974's ""The Towering Inferno,"" Steve McQueen put real life into Chief Michael O'Hallorhan by creating his character from the inside out, using an introspective approach to establish O'Hallorhan the man first, then O'Hallorhan the hero secondarily, and it worked.  What is unfortunate here, especially, is the fact that Travolta is a much better actor than what Russell allowed him to be.The supporting cast includes Robert Patrick (Lenny); Morris Chestnut (Tommy); Billy Burke (Dennis); Balthazar Getty (Ray); Desiree Care (Maria); and Deidra LaWan Starnes (Marlene).  Firefighters and their families are no doubt going to find themselves on an emotional roller coaster with this film, and given what they live with on a daily basis, that is entirely understandable.  For everyone else, however, ""Ladder 49"" will be somewhat entertaining, even emotionally engaging at times, but not entirely memorable.",3,Smoke Gets In Your Eyes,1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,3384,"['connotation', 'heroism', 'inescapable', 'when', 'discussing', 'professional', 'firefighters', 'especially', 'wake', '9/11', 'Let', 'face', 'person', 'running', 'burning', 'building', 'when', 'everyone', 'else', 'desperately', 'trying', 'get', 'out', 'going', 'be', 'hero', 'eyes', 'many', 'Ladder', '49', 'directed', 'Jay', 'Russell', 'starring', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'John', 'Travolta', 'hero', 'sense', 'heroism', 'presented', 'explored.The', 'film', 'career', 'fireman', 'Jack', 'Morrison', 'Phoenix', 'rookie', 'days', 'following', 'years', 'veteran', 'firehouse', 'tutelage', 'Captain', 'Mike', 'Kennedy', 'Travolta', 'who', 'always', 'hand', 'listen', 'question', 'impart', 'wisdom', 'age', 'experience', 'Jack', 'especially', 'pivotal', 'times', 'life.Over', 'period', 'time', 'Jack', 'ropes', 'firefighting', 'skills', 'matures', 'way', 'life', 'love', 'When', 'attractive', 'young', 'woman', 'grocery', 'store', 'Linda', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'sparks', 'fly', ""n't"", 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'part', 'story', 'going.Visually', 'film', 'stunning', 'times', 'fires', 'are', 'spectacular', 'can', 'fairly', 'feel', 'heat', 'flames', 'bound', 'instill', 'one', 'admiration', 'firefighters', 'who', 'risk', 'performance', 'duties', 'perspective', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'living', 'danger', 'binds', 'together', 'special', 'way', 'other', 'hand', 'way', 'Russell', 'bonding', 'also', 'impression', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'somehow', 'live', 'apart', 'commoners', 'air', 'breathe', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'more', 'rarefied', 'what', 'available', 'rest', 'us.The', 'flaw', 'what', 'essentially', 'decent', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'placed', 'directly', 'lap', 'director', 'who', 'mistake', 'putting', 'heroes', 'pedestal', 'right', 'gate', 'other', 'reason', 'fact', 'are', 'firemen', 'doing', 'so', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'riveting', 'drama', 'lapse', 'unnecessary', 'melodrama', 'very', 'nearly', 'ship', 'early', 'camaraderie', 'firehouse', 'instance', 'exercise', 'cliche', 'allowing', 'actors', 'struggle', 'development', 'characters.Phoenix', 'passable', 'performance', 'Jack', 'Travolta', 'across', 'actor', 'playing', 'role', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'played', 'rather', 'creating', 'real', 'identity', 'Mike', 'Russell', 'get', 'away', 'similar', 'role', '1974', 'Towering', 'Inferno', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'put', 'real', 'life', 'Chief', 'Michael', ""O'Hallorhan"", 'creating', 'character', 'inside', 'using', 'introspective', 'approach', 'establish', ""O'Hallorhan"", 'man', 'first', 'then', ""O'Hallorhan"", 'hero', 'secondarily', 'worked', 'What', 'unfortunate', 'here', 'especially', 'fact', 'Travolta', 'much', 'better', 'actor', 'what', 'Russell', 'allowed', 'be.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Lenny', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'Tommy', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'Dennis', 'Balthazar', 'Getty', 'Ray', 'Desiree', 'Care', 'Maria', 'Deidra', 'LaWan', 'Starnes', 'Marlene', 'Firefighters', 'families', 'are', 'doubt', 'going', 'find', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'film', 'given', 'what', 'live', 'daily', 'basis', 'entirely', 'understandable', 'everyone', 'else', 'however', 'Ladder', '49', 'will', 'be', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'even', 'emotionally', 'engaging', 'times', 'not', 'entirely', 'memorable']",Ladder 49

Instead, it is an in-depth look at the life of firefighter Jack Morrisson played by Joaquin Phoenix. It's the usual story of struggle to success, to tragedy, and finally one of hope as the credits begin to roll. Ladder 49 is a family film made for all the firefighters out there. It has it's predictable moments as family films tend to have. It has the firefighter who dies in the beginning, another one who gets badly injured, and the hero who sets the tone at the end. It's your typical firefighter genre film that seems a little repetitive and truly does not stand out as a classic film for years to come. As I said, don't expect this to be a gritty film ala Backdraft, but it does have it's moments that put a smile on your face. It's a movie void of a definitive plot, but about the lifespan of what a firefighter might deal with in his career.

Ladder 49, Engine 33 is one of the Baltimore Fire Department's Fire Houses.  When a huge warehouse with two workers inside begins to blaze, Ladder 49 is called in to try and bring them out.  After saving the first man, firefighter Jack Morrison manages to find and save the other victim.  As he tries to help, the grain dust in the buidling explodes causing the floors to cave in and throwing Morrison down several floors.  Will the men of Ladder 49 be able to get to Morrison before it is too late?  The movie is told in flashback beginning with Jack's first day at the fire house and through his many years at Ladder 49, while also showing the efforts of the other firefighters to save him in the burning building.  The movie does have plenty of action, but it also details what a firefighter's life is like.  Ladder 49 shows their personal problems at home, the constant waiting for that alarm that could go off at anytime, and also the fires they try to put out and the people they try to save.  Highly recommended for an excellent portrayal of the life of a firefighter.Joaquin Phoenix is very good as firefighter Jack Morrison.  By the end of the movie, you come to feel like you really know this person.  John Travolta is turns in a fine performance as Captain Mike Kennedy, head of Ladder 49 and a father figure to Jack.  Jacinda Barrett plays Jack's wife Linda, who lives in fear of what might happen to her husband while he is on duty.

Among them, John Travolta and Robert Patrick provide the strongest performance.As I said before, the story is not strong.  Though the script tries to present round characters, sometimes referring to the cultural background of the firefighters, the plot seems generic, especially when it handles with the husband-wife relation part in Jack's life.  Some characters are very flat, and even the skillful actors like Balthazar Getty remain unmemorable.But I like the sinceity deeply felt in the film, and the horrible fire that burns down the buildings is convincingly made.  Perhaps what we need is a documentary about the firefighters.  (Is there any?  If there is, let me know.)  Until then 'Ladder 49' will be a good tribute to them.",4,'Trying to Do the Job the Best They Can': Sincerely Done,1119312000,"06 21, 2005",2005,1566,"['3.5', 'STARS', 'Originality', 'not', 'what', 'find', '49', 'script', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'sincere', 'attitudes', 'film', 'firefighters', 'are', 'really', 'remarkable', 'film', 'greatly', 'helped', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Jack', 'Morrison.The', 'film', 'mainly', 'Jack', 'life', 'growing', 'up', 'novice', 'experienced', 'firefighter', 'also', 'dedicated', 'activities', 'firefighters', 'Baltimore', 'lead', 'tragic', 'results', 'However', 'most', 'realistic', 'part', '49', 'not', 'burning', 'fire', 'descriptions', 'everyday', 'life', 'Jack', 'Morrison', 'collegues', 'firehouse.Besides', 'terrific', 'Phoenix', 'film', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Balthazar', 'Getty', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'provide', 'strongest', 'performance.As', 'said', 'story', 'not', 'strong', 'script', 'present', 'round', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'referring', 'cultural', 'background', 'firefighters', 'plot', 'generic', 'especially', 'when', 'husband-wife', 'relation', 'part', 'Jack', 'life', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'flat', 'even', 'skillful', 'actors', 'Balthazar', 'Getty', 'remain', 'unmemorable.But', 'like', 'sinceity', 'deeply', 'felt', 'film', 'horrible', 'fire', 'down', 'buildings', 'convincingly', 'made', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'need', 'documentary', 'firefighters', 'there', 'let', 'know', 'then', '49', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'tribute']",Ladder 49
