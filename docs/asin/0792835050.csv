A young RAF pilot is getting married. Henry Favor works at the train station, his landlady has a surprise. Four years pass. That married couple lives in a cottage on tiny Storm Island. They have problems. ""The Needle"" sends and receives messages to Berlin. His assignment is to check the strength of Patton's army in East Anglia. Favor leaves no witnesses when he escapes. Sergeant Billy Parkin is called to identify ""Henry Favor"", ""the Needle"". Favor discovers the decoys! He escapes detection again, the passes a message to a neutral diplomat. MI5 grabs the diplomat, the ""Needle"" escapes at a train station. The plan is to let Billy identify Favor, but Favor hears the voice and escapes again.Favor's portrait is in the newspaper so people can identify him. Favor steals a small boat to sail away to contact the U-boat. The seas are rough, the boat strikes a rock, and Favor escapes again. [Believable?] Favor lands at the home of the couple we met at the beginning of this story. Lucy the mother bathes her child. David raises sheep. They are isolated on Storm Island. [Coffee and gasoline were rationed.] ""Is it that obvious?"" Lucy is lonely. Favor says he is a writer. David found that can of film and suspects Favor. Another problem solved. Was Favor delayed by Lucy? Later Lucy finds David by the shore, he won't talk. She knows Favor lied about David! She drives away to escape Favor in the pouring rain. She finds Tom, but he can't help her. Lucy knows how to handle a firearm, or an axe! The police tell her to destroy the radio. There is dramatic tension when Lucy prevents the radio from working! Will Favor escape in a small boat? Will help arrive at the island in time?The efficient British Secret Service caught all the German spies sent to England in WW 2. The defeat of Germany meant their remaining secret archives were read. The ""Ultra Secret"" played a big part in this. This story is an entertaining fantasy. But it does show how the right to keep and bear arms existed in war-time Britain (until 1946).",3,A Fantasy Spy Thriller,1263081600,"01 10, 2010",2010,2161,"['Eye', 'Needle', '1981', 'filmThe', 'film', 'wartime', 'Great', 'Britain', 'Fall', 'France', 'Troops', 'are', 'boarding', 'trains', 'Finland', 'young', 'RAF', 'pilot', 'getting', 'married', 'Henry', 'Favor', 'train', 'station', 'landlady', 'surprise', 'Four', 'years', 'pass', 'married', 'couple', 'lives', 'cottage', 'tiny', 'Storm', 'Island', 'have', 'problems', 'Needle', 'sends', 'receives', 'messages', 'Berlin', 'assignment', 'check', 'strength', 'Patton', 'army', 'East', 'Anglia', 'Favor', 'witnesses', 'when', 'Sergeant', 'Billy', 'Parkin', 'called', 'identify', 'Henry', 'Favor', 'Needle', 'Favor', 'decoys', 'detection', 'again', 'passes', 'message', 'neutral', 'diplomat', 'MI5', 'grabs', 'diplomat', 'Needle', 'train', 'station', 'plan', 'let', 'Billy', 'identify', 'Favor', 'Favor', 'voice', 'again.Favor', 'portrait', 'newspaper', 'people', 'can', 'identify', 'Favor', 'small', 'boat', 'sail', 'away', 'contact', 'U-boat', 'seas', 'are', 'rough', 'boat', 'rock', 'Favor', 'again', '[', 'Believable', ']', 'Favor', 'home', 'couple', 'met', 'beginning', 'story', 'Lucy', 'mother', 'child', 'David', 'sheep', 'are', 'isolated', 'Storm', 'Island', 'Coffee', 'gasoline', 'were', 'rationed', ']', 'obvious', 'Lucy', 'lonely', 'Favor', 'writer', 'David', 'found', 'can', 'film', 'suspects', 'Favor', 'problem', 'solved', 'Was', 'Favor', 'delayed', 'Lucy', 'Later', 'Lucy', 'David', 'shore', 'wo', ""n't"", 'talk', 'Favor', 'lied', 'David', 'away', 'escape', 'Favor', 'pouring', 'rain', 'Tom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'Lucy', 'how', 'handle', 'firearm', 'axe', 'police', 'tell', 'destroy', 'radio', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'when', 'Lucy', 'radio', 'working', 'Will', 'Favor', 'escape', 'small', 'boat', 'Will', 'help', 'arrive', 'island', 'time', 'efficient', 'British', 'Secret', 'Service', 'caught', 'German', 'spies', 'sent', 'England', 'WW', '2', 'defeat', 'Germany', 'meant', 'remaining', 'secret', 'archives', 'were', 'read', 'Ultra', 'Secret', 'played', 'big', 'part', 'story', 'entertaining', 'fantasy', 'show', 'how', 'right', 'keep', 'bear', 'arms', 'existed', 'war-time', 'Britain', '1946']",N/A

Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 6]","So, at first I had trouble deciding if this film was great or just another war film that would be forgotten about as the years progressed.  It was a tough decision that required a day of thought.  There were definitely scenes in this film that would embarrass even the most novice movie goer, yet there is something about the story and the humanistic approach to a non-human element that seeps from this film's pores.  The scene that stands out the most in my mind is when Sutherland is running to the rain to catch Lucy.  You can obviously tell that he is on a sound stage and water is being thrown in his face.  His acting and the way that that particular scene was set up was appalling.  It made me laugh instead of feel any sort of suspense or fear.  It forced credibility for Sutherland's character right out the door.  There were several other scenes that just didn't seem to fit in this film that made you question the theatrical release of this film or if it was a straight-to-television production.  If you can get through these few lapses in the director's train of thought, then you will be able to see the powerful story that lies within.When I first saw the box to this film I didn't know what to expect.  To my utter enjoyment, Eye of the Needle is one of those gems hiding in a mud puddle.  After you wipe it off (look away from the DVD cover), you will begin to see the beauty of this film.  As we begin our story, we see Sutherland as a normal person, but as the film advances, our idea and interpretation of his character blows our mind.  When most war films simply believe in keeping you in your theater seats by showing graphic images of battle and chaos, this film goes in the completely other direction.  This is a story between two people and the small battle that they fight for their beliefs.  I mentioned earlier that I felt this was a very humanistic film.  The reason for that statement is because we witness the human element to war.  Billy is the perfect example of a man who has lost a portion of his life, yet is too depressed to see the happiness in front of him.  Normally in war films this comes late story, but in Eye of the Needle it is shown right up front.  Next, we hardly ever are given a very human side to the villain in these stories.  Normally, they kill without remorse, but again, not in this film.  What we witness are two humans caught between a hard place with nobody else to turn to.While war is being raged overseas with thousands of troopers, it is impressive to see stories like this that revolve around just two people.  These two people can have the same effect on the war as a brigade of soldiers.  I never saw their reaction to each other coming.  I wasn't expecting a message in this film.  I brief history lesson about the day to day activities surrounding this dark cloud of our world's history.  Also, I wasn't expecting to see such powerful acting from Donald Sutherland and Kate Nelligan.  Together they created more sparks on screen than most duos today.  What they create is better and more realistic than most Hollywood jargon.It is impressive to see this in a war film.  I cannot stress that enough.  This film surprised me and I am normally not a huge war fan.  I think the reason that it stood out was because director Richard Marquand develops two amazing characters and places them in a war torn country, only to uproot them again into a place of beauty and nature.  We go from one spectrum to the next with Marquand and it works.  Ken Follett, who wrote the novel that this film is based, has done a great job of taking a world that is huge and bringing it down to just these two characters.  It is not often that you see that in a war film, especially one made in 1981.Overall, I flip-flopped my decision all around until I finally made a choice.  This film was amazing.  I can look past the low-budgeted scenes that make this film dated in the 80s, and see the amazing truth behind the characters and story.  This is one of the most impressive stories that I have seen come from Hollywood.  I could literally watch this film again and probably catch more that I missed the first time.  This isn't your average spy film; this is instead a film about humans and the comfort we need in our lives.  Also, I must end with this note, if any villain (without saying who) can use his trademark kill six times in forty minutes, you should realize that this film is going to be a great ride.Grade: **** out of *****",4,The war has come down to the two of us.,1099267200,"11 1, 2004",2004,4480,"['So', 'first', 'had', 'trouble', 'deciding', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'just', 'war', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'forgotten', 'years', 'progressed', 'was', 'tough', 'decision', 'required', 'day', 'thought', 'were', 'definitely', 'scenes', 'film', 'would', 'embarrass', 'even', 'most', 'novice', 'movie', 'goer', 'yet', 'something', 'story', 'humanistic', 'approach', 'non-human', 'element', 'film', 'pores', 'scene', 'out', 'most', 'mind', 'when', 'Sutherland', 'running', 'rain', 'catch', 'Lucy', 'can', 'obviously', 'tell', 'sound', 'stage', 'water', 'being', 'thrown', 'face', 'acting', 'way', 'particular', 'scene', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'was', 'appalling', 'made', 'instead', 'feel', 'sort', 'suspense', 'fear', 'forced', 'credibility', 'Sutherland', 'character', 'right', 'door', 'were', 'several', 'other', 'scenes', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'film', 'made', 'question', 'theatrical', 'release', 'film', 'was', 'straight-to-television', 'production', 'can', 'get', 'few', 'lapses', 'director', 'train', 'thought', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'powerful', 'story', 'within.When', 'first', 'saw', 'box', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'utter', 'enjoyment', 'Eye', 'Needle', 'one', 'gems', 'hiding', 'mud', 'puddle', 'wipe', 'off', 'look', 'away', 'DVD', 'cover', 'will', 'begin', 'see', 'beauty', 'film', 'begin', 'story', 'see', 'Sutherland', 'normal', 'person', 'film', 'advances', 'idea', 'interpretation', 'character', 'mind', 'When', 'most', 'war', 'films', 'simply', 'believe', 'keeping', 'theater', 'seats', 'showing', 'graphic', 'images', 'battle', 'chaos', 'film', 'completely', 'other', 'direction', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'small', 'battle', 'fight', 'beliefs', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'felt', 'was', 'very', 'humanistic', 'film', 'reason', 'statement', 'witness', 'human', 'element', 'war', 'Billy', 'perfect', 'example', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'portion', 'life', 'too', 'depressed', 'see', 'happiness', 'front', 'Normally', 'war', 'films', 'late', 'story', 'Eye', 'Needle', 'shown', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'Next', 'hardly', 'ever', 'are', 'given', 'very', 'human', 'side', 'villain', 'stories', 'Normally', 'kill', 'remorse', 'again', 'not', 'film', 'What', 'witness', 'are', 'two', 'humans', 'caught', 'hard', 'place', 'nobody', 'else', 'turn', 'to.While', 'war', 'being', 'raged', 'overseas', 'thousands', 'troopers', 'impressive', 'see', 'stories', 'revolve', 'around', 'just', 'two', 'people', 'two', 'people', 'can', 'have', 'same', 'effect', 'war', 'brigade', 'soldiers', 'never', 'saw', 'reaction', 'other', 'coming', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'message', 'film', 'brief', 'history', 'lesson', 'day', 'day', 'activities', 'surrounding', 'dark', 'cloud', 'world', 'history', 'Also', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'see', 'such', 'powerful', 'acting', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'Together', 'created', 'more', 'sparks', 'screen', 'most', 'duos', 'today', 'What', 'create', 'better', 'more', 'realistic', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'jargon.It', 'impressive', 'see', 'war', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'enough', 'film', 'surprised', 'am', 'normally', 'not', 'huge', 'war', 'fan', 'think', 'reason', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'director', 'Richard', 'Marquand', 'two', 'amazing', 'characters', 'places', 'war', 'torn', 'country', 'only', 'uproot', 'again', 'place', 'beauty', 'nature', 'go', 'one', 'spectrum', 'next', 'Marquand', 'Ken', 'Follett', 'who', 'wrote', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'taking', 'world', 'huge', 'bringing', 'down', 'just', 'two', 'characters', 'not', 'often', 'see', 'war', 'film', 'especially', 'one', 'made', '1981.Overall', 'flip-flopped', 'decision', 'finally', 'made', 'choice', 'film', 'was', 'amazing', 'can', 'look', 'low-budgeted', 'scenes', 'make', 'film', 'dated', '80s', 'see', 'amazing', 'truth', 'characters', 'story', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'stories', 'have', 'seen', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'literally', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'probably', 'catch', 'more', 'missed', 'first', 'time', ""n't"", 'average', 'spy', 'film', 'instead', 'film', 'humans', 'comfort', 'need', 'lives', 'Also', 'must', 'end', 'note', 'villain', 'saying', 'who', 'can', 'use', 'trademark', 'kill', 'six', 'times', 'forty', 'minutes', 'should', 'realize', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'ride.Grade', '****', '*****']",N/A

136202,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0792835050,Austin Somlo,"[0, 2]","Viewed: 1/11Rate: 61/11: Eye of the Needle was getting my attention very well until Donald Sutherland's character got shipwrecked. Then, the movie fell apart from there. It got very boring because things slowed down greatly, and then, finally, when Sutherland's character was fully realized, he began to do very stupid things that ultimately got him killed. I really had a very, very difficult time in believing in his mistakes because he was too good for them. Come on, he was a successful spy for Germany who had undertaken more difficult missions in his career. At least show respect for his character. His was a bit too alike to the one in The Eagle Has Landed. Meanwhile, I thought the cast was perfectly fine, and Kate Nelligan was the standout of the film. Donald was great as usual, an experienced pro who could have been helped more by a better direction. Granted, by the looks of the ending, Eye of the Needle felt like the anti-Casablanca; however, I was not feeling it very much. The emotions...the irony of it all...they weren't convincing to me. That's why I felt the movie fell apart also by that. I blame it on Richard Marquand for his poor direction and inept handling of that situation. Really, Donald Sutherland's was the most fascinating character of the film until the shipwreck moment. Obviously, another stunning part about Eye of the Needle is the location, especially of the house on Storm Island which was actually the Isle of Mull, Argyll and Bute, and Oban, Argyll and Bute, Scotland, UK. It makes me to want to live there. It is very pretty. Thinking of how the spy got shot, do you expect me to believe that the housewife would hit her target in three out of six shots? Impossible, maybe one will do by sheer luck of aiming it right. One fiction about the film is that helicopters weren't used in World War II.

And I would not think in a million years that Donald Sutherland would be picked to play Henry Faber.

136204,A1URPQ4S8TJCR4,0792835050,Bert vanC Bailey,"[1, 1]","This early 80s Nazi spy caper is still a very decent thriller. It has the distinction of being based on one of Ken Follett's best plots, fine acting by Canadians Kate Nelligan and Donald Sutherland, a fair script, and competent direction. It never was a top-rank cinematic hit, what with its middling budget and production values, but there's a great deal to enjoy all the same.The plot ties in a crippled pilot whose impotence - psychic or otherwise - leaves his attractive wife (Nelligan) with unmet needs, until she meets a Nazi spy. He's played with suitable menace by Sutherland - in a sociopathic role he reprised later, in Bertolucci's '1900.' The drama has a conventional yet slick and convincing build-up to a highly dramatic close, where Nelligan must carry on after learning about her lover. The film's second string of talent is relatively weak, and not quite relieved even by the weighty Ian Bannen leading the charge against the villain. That plotline barely enters the story, adding fairly thin, although unneeded, suspense.Sutherland menacingly brandishes an extra-long switchblade as well as eyes that have never looked quite as steely ice-blue. Its list of victims is a bit too long, and the stabbings may be too low-tech for current audiences: each one slides as if into butter, while we get to watch the blood spurt. In truth, however, this is Kate Nelligan's film, and perhaps the best onscreen display of her impressive talents and unusual beauty. Although fighting on the side of good, in classic noir form she's relentlessly out to thwart the man's success. With Sutherland assisting, Nelligan's dramatic performance lifts this movie well above the rocky shoals of its meagre budget.Also, this caper's historical backdrop is refreshingly accurate: the Germans were indeed misled to think the Allied landing would be at Pas de Calais, not Normandy, and that ruse involved elaborate doings. Famed General Patton was brought out of the doghouse of retirement, where he had been atoning for his haughty transgressions, on a gamble that his name alone would spark the Germans' attention. A 'notional' (non-existent) army and air force were even contrived to account for the faux landing. This subterfuge is deftly threaded into Follett's plot, never once requiring a credulous, let alone a cretinous, audience. In fact, the Germans were so successfully duped into fixating on the wrong location, along with overblown views of the Allied military strength, that, once the landings in Normandy began, their generals thought they smelled a rat. They refused to mobilize to counter it, until it was too late to stop the onslaught! (Or so say the victors: see my review ofThe Spies Who Never Were: The True Story of the Nazi Spies Who Were Actually Allied Double Agents).Despite its budget, then, this movie is a good treatment of one of Follett's best thrillers (try also his book 'The Man From St Petersburg'). Aside from Nelligan, its landmark distinction is in having the last soundtrack by Miklos Rozsa - perhaps the greatest composer ever to grace movies with music. This ended a career that began in 1937, earning him considerable fame and 3 Academy Awards. Soundtracks were only half of Rozsa's double life, since top-flight 'classical' artists, such as Heifetz, Piatigorsky and J&aacute;nos Starker, championed his concert works (strongly recommended as some of the 20th century's most captivating neo-Romantic music). They reflect the glories of his Hungarian roots and, to my ear, close attention to Bela Bartok's most passionate music.

The film also is exciting, well acted and engrossing. Please note: elements of the plot are discussed below. Henry Faber (Donald Sutherland) is a ruthless, extremely competent German spy in England during WWII masquerading as an Englishman. When threatened, he's as quick to kill his landlady who discovers him at a clandestine radio as he is a fellow spy who might be captured. His preferred method is a quick, deep stiletto thrust to the heart.Faber discovers that Patton's Third Army is a sham and that the invasion of Europe will take place at Normandy, not the Pas de Calais. Before he can transmit the information, he's shipwrecked on isolated Storm Island off the coast of Scotland. The only inhabitants are David (Christopher Cazenove), a former fighter pilot who lost the use of his legs on the day of his marriage four years ago, his wife, Lucy (Kate Nelligan), their four-year-old son, Joe, and Tom, an elderly man, often drunk, who looks after the lighthouse and takes care of the couple's sheep. David is deeply embittered, full of self-pity and suspicious. He's either unable or unwilling to be intimate with his wife. Lucy is loyal, but so lonely for affection she is drawn to the ship-wrecked, charming man in her midst. In some strange way, Faber also is drawn to Lucy...perhaps not by love, exactly, but toward a kind of closeness he has never permitted himself before.One night, when David has taken a sleeping pill and gone to bed, Faber and Lucy are talking in front of the fire. Faber tells Lucy that her little boy is lucky to be so obviously loved. ""I'm his mother,"" Lucy says with a smile, ""and parents love their children."" ""No, no, not all,"" Faber says. ""Some parents use their children...set goals for them...goals they weren't able to attain in their lives. Hardly love, do you think?"" They make love that night. Later, in his need to contact a German submarine which will take him back to Germany with the invasion information, Faber will kill her husband, kill Tom, threaten Lucy...and when it would have been easy to kill Lucy, choose not to. ""The war has come down to the two of us,"" he tells her. ""I did what I had to do. It can't be undone. I'm sorry."" The ending is, I suppose, inevitable.The first half of Eye of the Needle is an exciting espionage story. We learn who the Needle is, how he works, how resourceful and how deadly he can be. The second half of the movie takes place on Storm Island. Slowly we see this strange relationship between two needy people evolve, one of whom, the Needle, has shown himself to be coldly ruthless. At the same time, we're drawn to Lucy as she realizes that the man she has given herself to has killed her husband and may be a threat to her son and herself. The climax of the movie, a bloody showdown in the decrepit lighthouse and then on the wet, stoney beach where Faber has discovered a small row boat he can use to get to the waiting sub, is harrowing. It's melodramatic and it packs a punch.Donald Sutherland and Kate Nelligan are both, in my opinion, superb actors, and they were never better than in this movie. The DVD picture is excellent.

I decided to comment on Sutherland's character, the Needle, because as a relatively new psychotherapist I found myself wondering during the first half of the film whether this man was sociopathic (I have to disagree with another reviewer who said he was ""psychotic"") or whether he was turning off whatever feelings he might have about killing because it was what he had to do.  In other words, would this man have the capacity to kill were it not socially sanctioned and viewed as a necessity during wartime?  Arguably, he might not have killed Kate Nelligan's husband had he not confronted him about the camera film of the airplanes and not killed the lighthouse keeper if he had been able to use the wireless without being discovered.  He did not harm Kate Nelligan or her son, even when she chopped off part of his hand and fried the wireless (and he looked at her burnt fingers with a subtle compassion).  This tells me he was capable of caring, if not love.  We have hints to his adult personality, as influenced by his chiildhood, from comments he made about parents essentially using children for their needs and not really loving them (we assume he was talking about himself).  But he said it in a way that felt like he had an understanding of his childhood as opposed to a person who was simply acting out from repressed rage.  What do others think?  Is he sociopathic (anti-social personality disorder would be the diagnosis according to the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the DSM-IV TR), does he have some sociopathy but not rigidified enough to call him personality disordered, or a normal guy capable of handling complex and highly stressful situations in wartime (and following through on what others need him to do, as socialized to do by his parents)?  I don't think a person suffering from unresolved childhood trauma (the fight, flight, or freeze response) would be able to hold it together and think as clearly as he was able to over an extended period of time either.  Thoughts?One more question:  a couple of reviewers mentioned that this DVD was an edited version of the film. Is this true?

In 1944, the tide is turned; and Germany now finds itself in a  defensive posture. The Germans are convinced that the allies are planning  an invasion of France. -- but where?The Needle uncovers critical  information to indicate that the Allies are planning an invasion of  Normady.  Unfortunately for the Needle and Germany, on his way to  delivering this vital information, he gets stranded on a remote island.  At  this point in the film, director Richard Marquand shows his cunning and  artistic talents at convincingly weaving a supberb spy thriller and a  romance movie together as one.The Needle has to deliver his critical  information to Germany.  However, he cannot do so while stranded on the  island.  To complicate matters, the Needle now has romatic interests which  causes him to delay his mission.  But, at the same time, causes The Needle  great anxiety because he knows he has to relay his information to Germany.  The Needle knows that the fate of Germany rests in his hands.Sutherland plays the part of a notorious, ruthless, and cunning German  spy to absolute perfection.  You also see Sutherland struggle with himself  to complete his mission, and save Germany.  Kate Nelligan magnificently  plays the role of a woman torn between &quot;romance&quot; and &quot;duty  to her country.&quot;This is not your typical James Bond or Matt Helm  flicks with all the well-shaped, beautiful women; fancy gadgets, and  explosive action.

When I put in my antique video cassette only to find it had bitten the dust, I had to get a DVD.  Despite his stellar performance in Redford's &#34;Ordinary People&#34; a year before, it was this film that made me a fan of Donald Sutherland.  His acting is so subtle which is perhaps the reason he has amazingly never received an Oscar nomination, despite an incredible volume of work in his career.  In my book, he is one of the most under-rated actors in Hollywood.  As German spy Faber, code named &#34;The Needle,&#34; Sutherland flashes a disarming smile, much like a butcher who pets the animal before slaughter.  One wonders at his isolation.  In the moments when he reveals that &#34;all parents do not love their children; some parents use their children,&#34; we get a glimpse of a past that might explain his drive in the solitary life of espionage to fight for Nazi Germany.  Kate Nelligan, who was nominated for a supporting Oscar for &#34;Prince of Tides,&#34; turns in an entrancing performance as Lucy, a woman trapped in a marriage that brings her no joy.  Christopher Cazenove plays husband Dave who is disabled in a car accident and bitterly is unable to adjust to life.  Alan Hume's cinematography makes the most of the broad Irish coast of remote Storm Island and is particularly good in the many close-quarters shots such as on the train, in the lighthouse and on the boat.

136247,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,0792835050,Stephanie De Pue,"[6, 6]","1981's ""Eye of the Needle,"" a canny World War II spy drama, is another of the good romantic thrillers made in the 80's.  It's based on a novel by Ken Follett, with screenplay by Stanley Mann.  It stars the Canadians Kate Nelligan and Donald Sutherland, at the head of an excellent British cast; and it boasts a stunning musical score by Miklos Rosza, his last, that undoubtedly contributes to the film's moods.  It was made on location in London and Scotland, features quite beautiful cinematography by Alan Hulme, and was ably directed by Richard Marquand.The film opens at a critical point in the ongoing war.  It deals with the so-called ""Henry Faber,"" important German spy dubbed ""The Needle"" at home for his favorite way of despatching people, by stiletto (Sutherland).  We find him in place in a railway yard, a useful place for him to be, until Hitler personally assigns him to double check the impending Allied plans to invade mainland Europe.  This assignment will bring him eventually to isolated Storm Island, off Scotland's coast, where he will meet David, legless former air pilot (Christopher Cazenove), and his unhappy wife Lucy (Nelligan).  It quickly becomes a romantic triangle.  The affair between Sutherland and Nelligan is a mature, passionate, sexy one: the film has placed Sutherland's age at 40, and Nelligan has been given a son.Sutherland gives a creepily forceful performance as The Needle, although his accent sometimes wavers.  Nelligan gives one of her trademark big, intense performances: it seems to me she was once tipped as Hollywood's next big female star, and it never happened, for reasons unknown to me.  But she really carries this picture.  Cazenove is surprisingly good as the embittered former flyboy.  Ian Banner turns in his usual fine performance as chief spy sweeper.  Rupert Fraser makes the most of his one scene as Muller.  And, in a very small part at the end, we see Bill Nighy, who has suddenly, recently, become a star at an age when a lot of burnt-out stars are selling real estate.When you think of it though, The Needle and Lucy must inevitably clash; just the two of them on the tiny island.  Mind you, patriotism's all very well, but I consider this film more a good illustration of the age-old fact that women are more fixed in place than are men.  The Needle, as a spy, is, by definition, a long way from home.  But Lucy owns a farm, and has a son who will someday expect to inherit.  She doesn't have the option of, say, running off to Germany with Faber.  In fact, this exact same situation underlies the Harrison Ford-Kelly McGillis relationship in the powerful romantic thriller ""Witness,"" also from the 80's.So, as the knockout ending unspools, The Needle tells Lucy, ""The War has come down to the two of us... I did what I had to do, it cannot be undone. I'm sorry.""

After frequent demonstrations of his adeptness with a switchblade, his top nazi spy `The Needle' and his bad English accent are shipwrecked on Storm Island, where Kate Nelligan lives with her crippled husband Christopher Cazenove and their badly dubbed child. While Ian Bannen fritters away on the mainland in lukewarm pursuit before his prey can get away with D-Day secrets, the two leads start an affair before things turn nasty. You'd have thought that after the last time Nelligan played a girl called Lucy who rescued a near-drowned stranger turned out (in 1979's Dracula) she'd have learned her lesson...Miklos Rozsa delivers a vividly romantic score that is both full of overpowering dramatic drive and in completely the wrong picture (it works better on disc) while Richard Marquand's merely functional direction, wildly overrated at the time because the news had just leaked out that he'd been signed to direct Return of the Jedi (`so he must be good' as one critic profoundly put it before finding out what a botched job he made of that assignment), fails to elevate the picture. The result is one of those films you really want to like much more than it'll let you, entertaining enough but still somewhat disappointingly average. The unimpressive non-anamorphic widescreen transfer that's particularly poor on flesh tones and has a few wobbles and a horribly botched end title that has the score laid on twice out of synchronisation (so you can hear the middle of the cue playing at the same time as the beginning, making for a confused cacophony) on the English soundtrack doesn't help.The laserdisc release included an alternate ending (barely different from the one used) that's missing from the DVD, although the UK disc does restore the original censor trims to avoid an X certificate - but be warned, it's a mere six seconds of footage! The only extra here is the US trailer which goes to great lengths to hide the fact that the Needle is a spy and the film is set in WW2, instead pitching it as a slasher movie!",3,Donald Sutherland does it again...,1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,2338,"['strange', 'reason', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'presided', 'end', 'several', 'cinema', 'previously', 'sure', 'things', 'Alistair', 'Maclean', 'thriller', 'Bear', 'Island', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'comedies', 'Max', 'Dugan', 'Returns', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'adaptations', 'Ordeal', 'Innocence', 'Eye', 'Needle', 'WW2', 'romantic', 'thriller', 'frequent', 'demonstrations', 'adeptness', 'switchblade', 'top', 'nazi', 'spy', 'Needle', 'bad', 'English', 'accent', 'are', 'shipwrecked', 'Storm', 'Island', 'where', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'crippled', 'husband', 'Christopher', 'Cazenove', 'badly', 'dubbed', 'child', 'Ian', 'Bannen', 'away', 'mainland', 'lukewarm', 'pursuit', 'prey', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'D-Day', 'secrets', 'two', 'leads', 'start', 'affair', 'things', 'turn', 'nasty', ""'d"", 'have', 'thought', 'last', 'time', 'Nelligan', 'played', 'girl', 'called', 'Lucy', 'who', 'rescued', 'near-drowned', 'stranger', 'turned', 'out', '1979', 'Dracula', ""'d"", 'have', 'learned', 'lesson', 'Miklos', 'Rozsa', 'vividly', 'romantic', 'score', 'full', 'overpowering', 'dramatic', 'drive', 'completely', 'wrong', 'picture', 'better', 'disc', 'Richard', 'Marquand', 'merely', 'functional', 'direction', 'wildly', 'overrated', 'time', 'news', 'had', 'just', 'leaked', 'out', ""'d"", 'been', 'signed', 'direct', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'so', 'must', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'critic', 'profoundly', 'put', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'botched', 'job', 'made', 'assignment', 'elevate', 'picture', 'result', 'one', 'films', 'really', 'want', 'like', 'much', 'more', ""'ll"", 'let', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'still', 'somewhat', 'disappointingly', 'average', 'unimpressive', 'non-anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'particularly', 'poor', 'flesh', 'tones', 'few', 'wobbles', 'horribly', 'botched', 'end', 'title', 'score', 'laid', 'twice', 'synchronisation', 'can', 'hear', 'middle', 'cue', 'playing', 'same', 'time', 'beginning', 'making', 'confused', 'cacophony', 'English', 'soundtrack', ""n't"", 'help.The', 'laserdisc', 'release', 'included', 'alternate', 'ending', 'barely', 'different', 'one', 'used', 'missing', 'DVD', 'UK', 'disc', 'restore', 'original', 'censor', 'trims', 'avoid', 'X', 'certificate', 'be', 'warned', 'mere', 'six', 'seconds', 'footage', 'only', 'extra', 'here', 'US', 'trailer', 'great', 'lengths', 'hide', 'fact', 'Needle', 'spy', 'film', 'set', 'WW2', 'instead', 'pitching', 'slasher', 'movie']",N/A

But this actually follows the book closely.  The VHS quality was typically washed out somewhat, so the DVD would be a better experience.  Donald Sutherland does a good job portraying the Nazi spy.  The story is fast-paced and suspenseful.  Another example of good suspensful, political/war thrillers from the 70s.
