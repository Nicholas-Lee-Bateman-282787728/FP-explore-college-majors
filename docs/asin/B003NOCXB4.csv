1355729,A2RWGW6TGUX7E5,B003NOCXB4,"Gary Covington ""Southern Rocker""","[31, 33]","This is the closest, factual, portrayal, of the Hank Williams' story available. This movie was originally, released back in the 1960's. I remember seeing it on TV, as a child. This DVD is a re-issue, re-mastered, edition of this classic movie. It's not ""full screen"", but it's definitely, well worth the purchase, for a Hank, fan, like myself. I've studied the history of Hank Williams, and I know his life's story very well.This movie starts off with Hank as a young boy, shinning shoes, and singing, while his Black,""Street Musician"",Bluesman friend ""Tee-Tot"", plays the guitar. ""Tee-Tot"" is very impressed with Hank's singing, and how the ""word's & original"", songs, just naturally come to him. ""Tee-Tot"" (Rufus Payne) is the black man who taught Hank, how to play the guitar.It covers, the young man, Hank, in a traveling, ""medicine show"", and singing, & playing the guitar. (Hank was a headliner, on one of the last, greatest medicine shows, to travel throughout the South, selling ""Hadacol"").It covers Hank meeting & marrying ""Miss Audrey"", and his union with the Drifting Cowboy Band. It covers his early success in Montgomery, his success performing on the Louisiana Hayride, radio show, live from Shreveport, Louisiana, and Hank's first record deal, with Rose/Acuff. It covers the birth of his son Randall Hank Jr. It covers his tenure on the Grand Ole Opry, in Nashville. It covers his problems about getting drunk, and not being able to perform at times.It's not completely, true to life, but it is very close. The characters are all well portrayed. George Hamilton stars, as Hank Williams, and ""lip-synchs"", Hanks songs, while Hank, Jr. actually sings the songs, and he sounds just like his daddy on this movie. On the cover of the dvd movie it states you can hear these Hank Williams songs: ""Cold Cold Heart"", ""just waitin"", ""ramblim man"", ""Long Gone Lonesome Blues"", ""I saw the Light"", ""Your cheatin' Heart"", ""Jambalaya"", ""Kawliga"", ""Hey good lookin"", & ""Roll them up Pete"". However, after viewing this move serveral times, I realized that not all off these songs are in the actual movie. Some of them are, also in the movie you get the song ""I Can't Help It If I'm Still in Love With You"". I think what they were referring to was the soundtrack to this movie, containing songs sung by Hank Jr.It covers his death, and the announcement of his death, at the concert, he was traveling, to perform at, when he died. The crowd responds by singing, ""I saw the Light"".This is a great classic, that any true Hank Williams fan would certainly enjoy. I know I really enjoy mine.
