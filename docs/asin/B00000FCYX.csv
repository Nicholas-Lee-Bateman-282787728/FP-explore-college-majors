500048,A2DMEQZ2TTGZ34,B00000FCYX,A. parry,"[4, 4]","This particular effort by Charlton Heston is certainly worth a look, at least once.  In some ways, this film shows subtle hints of being just ever so slightly ""campy"" (in the way that many early 80's films can be), particularly during some of the initial opening sequences.  However, overall, this film ""is"" entertaining, even if most of the major plot points are reasonably predictable.  There are many, many reviews describing the basic story line, so I will refrain from simply rehashing what has already been clearly explained.  In my opinion, Charlton Heston gives a tremendous performance, and is truly believed as his colorful character when watching this film, even today in current times.  Kim Basinger is obviously very ""green"" with her acting skills in this movie, as it was one of her first, and it tends to show.  For example, you will definitely not be seeing the Basinger performance which was offered in ""Cellular"" a handful of years back.  However, she does turn in an adequate performance, and you do wish her character well.  Nick Mancuso seems like he's trying just a little to hard to convince us much of the time, and it tends to come off as slightly less than genuine.  But, once again, the performance of Heston makes up for these other quirks and weaknesses of the film.  The amazing scenery, and filming techniques used, certainly add to the appeal of the movie.  This definitely was a lower budget film, with a small cast, and a relatively simple and predictable plot by today's standard, so please set your expectations accordingly.  This truly is a very watchable film, just be sure to place it in your mailbox for less than ten dollars, if you can.  One or two viewings may be enough for many people.Now, . . . regarding this particular DVD release.  The widescreen format picture quality is very strong for a modest budget project from nearly 30 years ago.  The contrast is great, the colors are strong, and the clarity is definitely ""good"" (not spectacular).  However, the soundtrack for the film is lackluster at best.  The tones and sound effects which are more toward the ""loud"" range sound ""okay"".  But, the more intricate conversational dialogue is notably under amplified, and I often found myself ""maxing"" out the volume range (simultaneously) on both the television speakers and separate surround sound system.  Altering the sound settings didn't seem to help in any significant way.  Be prepared to keep your audio remote in hand and ready to go!!!GOOD LUCK.",4,"Entertaining, . . .

500050,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,B00000FCYX,Chip Kaufmann,"[1, 1]","The lure of gold and the consequences of greed have been a mainstay in literature since THE CANTERBURY TALES and in feature films since the Rudolph Valentino vehicle THE CONQUERING POWER in 1921. Along the way such movies as GREED (1923),TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE (1947), LUST FOR GOLD (1949), and GOLD (1974) have dealt in a dramatic fashion with the mining of gold. One of the very best films to deal with this subject and one of the least seen is the 1982 Charlton Heston adventure drama MOTHER LODE. Shot on location in Northern British Columbia, this film contains some of the most beautiful and striking cinematography that I have ever seen. From snow covered mountains to dark, menacing woods, to the grittiest, most claustrophobic mine interiors to ever grace the screen, MOTHER LODE's visuals will remain with you long after the film is over.The film is essentially a three character adventure drama centering on a young couple (Nick Mancuso, Kim Basinger) and their encounter with a Scottish miner (Charlton Heston) who is more like a force of nature than a man. The role of the miner was tailor made for Heston who is also the film's director which may have had something to do with it although he gives Mancuso and Basinger ample screen time to develop their characters. In fact poor Mancuso's character has his behind handed to him on more than one occasion as his various exploits usually end in disaster. Basinger, in only her second screen role, is strong and capable and gives us hints of the Kim to come. But the film is really Heston's show all the way and more for his directorial skills than for his acting which is larger than life but it fits the character. MOTHER LODE is not a great movie but if you're in the mood for an adventure flick with some surprising twists than you can't do better than this. The DVD transfer is gorgeous from the proper aspect radio to the vibrant visuals although the sound is a little soft on occasion. Highly recommended for action fans and fans of Charlton Heston although you don't have to be one to enjoy it.",4,The Lure Of Gold,1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,2069,"['lure', 'gold', 'consequences', 'greed', 'have', 'been', 'mainstay', 'literature', 'THE', 'CANTERBURY', 'TALES', 'feature', 'films', 'Rudolph', 'Valentino', 'vehicle', 'THE', 'CONQUERING', 'POWER', '1921', 'way', 'such', 'movies', 'GREED', '1923', 'TREASURE', 'THE', 'SIERRA', 'MADRE', '1947', 'LUST', 'FOR', 'GOLD', '1949', 'GOLD', '1974', 'have', 'dealt', 'dramatic', 'fashion', 'mining', 'gold', 'One', 'very', 'best', 'films', 'deal', 'subject', 'one', 'least', 'seen', '1982', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'adventure', 'drama', 'MOTHER', 'LODE', 'Shot', 'location', 'Northern', 'British', 'Columbia', 'film', 'most', 'beautiful', 'striking', 'cinematography', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'snow', 'covered', 'mountains', 'dark', 'menacing', 'woods', 'grittiest', 'most', 'claustrophobic', 'mine', 'interiors', 'ever', 'grace', 'screen', 'MOTHER', 'LODE', 'visuals', 'will', 'remain', 'long', 'film', 'over.The', 'film', 'essentially', 'three', 'character', 'adventure', 'drama', 'centering', 'young', 'couple', 'Nick', 'Mancuso', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'encounter', 'Scottish', 'miner', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'who', 'more', 'force', 'nature', 'man', 'role', 'miner', 'was', 'tailor', 'made', 'Heston', 'who', 'also', 'film', 'director', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'Mancuso', 'Basinger', 'ample', 'screen', 'time', 'develop', 'characters', 'fact', 'poor', 'Mancuso', 'character', 'behind', 'handed', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'various', 'exploits', 'usually', 'end', 'disaster', 'Basinger', 'only', 'second', 'screen', 'role', 'strong', 'capable', 'hints', 'Kim', 'come', 'film', 'really', 'Heston', 'show', 'way', 'more', 'directorial', 'skills', 'acting', 'larger', 'life', 'character', 'MOTHER', 'LODE', 'not', 'great', 'movie', ""'re"", 'mood', 'adventure', 'flick', 'surprising', 'twists', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'gorgeous', 'proper', 'aspect', 'radio', 'vibrant', 'visuals', 'sound', 'little', 'soft', 'occasion', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'action', 'fans', 'fans', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'one', 'enjoy']",Mother Lode VHS

500053,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,B00000FCYX,drkhimxz,"[0, 0]","Charlton Heston was on the verge of being 60, when he made this film. Fortunately, he had a good deal of time left to work until illness put an end to he career and then his life. While in his personal life he followed his  own star in the political world, in his acting he always gave the best that he could to meet the requirements of the  script. In this one, he was Director as well as Star, although there were a couple of other names up there with his own. He is good and makes a somewhat flaky script (by his son) into a quite watchable film. The female lead has nothing much to do except look good and be the subordinate &#34;girl-friend&#34; to the lost pilot, she and his best friend are searching for. In a thankless role, she meets the requirements. Nick Mancuso, who nominally is the male lead, has a part which is slated for a traditional mix of behaviors which can lose an audience easily. He is OK in it, but lacks the charisma to be a stand-out. Heston walks away with the honors. With rich brogue, he is the wizened old miner still looking for the Mother Lode after thirty years on the site. Your reaction to his role will pretty much determine your reaction to the film. While uncomfortable with a number of aspects of the film, Heston's performance made it a film I am happy not to have missed. I see by Wiki that those of us who watched it are a small and hardy band, those who watched and liked it are a still smaller group.

500062,ATMNM0IMFHL9,B00000FCYX,"John T. R. Gorman ""John Lee Booker""","[2, 2]","This 1982 thriller stars Charlton Heston as a pair of miserly Scottish twin brothers, one of whom is a violent madman. Together they jealously guard an old gold mine, and try to find its source vein, hence the film's title. The suspense is palpable, and that's the only problem... If I say any more I'll spoil the movie for you!I've spent decades waiting for its DVD release, as one of my all-time favorite movies. Why? Though I still think Heston's role as Moses in ""The Ten Commandments"" is his greatest work, I rank this film as second only to that, which says much.""Motherlode"" is noteworthy also in that it's only the second big-screen appearance by Kim Basinger, and, I believe, her first leading-lady role. I remember watching her performance in this film, hoping Ms. Basinger would get an Oscar nomination for it. Yes, she was that good! (She eventually won an Oscar in 1997's ""L.A. Confidential"").This film is also very personal for me. It premiered in my former home town, Kansas City. I worked for the radio station (KBEQ-FM) that sponsored the opening of ""Motherlode"". As a result, I was there in-studio, when Charlton Heston made a live guest appearance to promote the movie. Heston was incredibly gracious to everyone. As a bonus, Mr. Heston recited ""live"", from memory, Shakespeare's entire 29th Sonnet, the same performance that won him a college drama scholarship! (The poem ends, ""For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings, that I would scorn to change my state with kings"".)What a class guy Charlton Heston was! His manners and gracious way with everyone he met that day were completely genuine. He even took calls from listeners during his visit.

The acting was not terrible but the main character was kind of overacting.  Kim Bassinger was ok but she dosen't have a lot of range.  She was as good in this as any other movie I've seen her in.  Charlton Heston was pretty good.Also there was not a great plot.  I was not really convinced why the main character would do all the things he would do.  Maybe he was a risk taker and lusted for gold but I feel they could of given some more development on this prior to them leaving.Now for the bad.  I didn't care about any of the characters.  The main character was kind of a jerk.  If at all I would say that I cared for Kim Bassinger the most, but still not much.  Thrillers like Deliverence gave you characters that had some emotional weight if they lived or not.  This was standard 70's or 80's fare with people i didn't care about.About the dvd it looked great.  It is a widescreen letterbox.On a side note.

It is a honest film, with some pretty good moments, but nothing more.The whole story happens somewhere in North Canada wilderness. A pilot named Jean Dupre (Nick Mancuso), worried by the disappearance of his friend George Patterson who was making surveys in a remote area, buys an old DHC-2 Beaver floatplane and starts to search for him. Patterson's girlfriend, Andrea (Kim Basinger) will accompany him. When looking for Patterson's plane, the couple meets first an old hunter/fisherman, Elijah who lives with his family in the wilderness - and later a hermit/miner, Silas McGee (Charlton Heston), very friendly but probably just a little teensy weensy bit crazy... Dupre actually wants to combine the search with some prospecting for gold and this will ultimately put him and Andrea in lots of trouble... I will say no more about what follows...There are some good things in this film. The wilderness is very beautiful and all the mine crawling is very, very well done - and pretty creepy too... Charlton Heston (who also directed this film) clearly enjoyed a quite unusual role of an aging hermit dispensing wisdom with an inredibly appealing Scottish accent, calling Kim Basinger ""lass"" every two minutes or so. Kim Basinger is incredibly beautiful in this film with her long golden hair being, at least in my opinion, the real ""mother lode"" of the movie... And then, there is Elijah (John Marley) who is simply irresistible as probably the wisest and best spoken old timer I saw on the screen for a long time.However, the scenario is not very good. Jean Dupre character is kind of a jerk, with which I couldn't identify at all. There was supposed to be some ""guilty"" chemistry between himand Andrea (who after all is his best friend girlfriend...)but I coulnd't detect any. And the ending is rather unsatisfying.But still, I do not regret that I watched it. Charlton Heston's talent and Kim Basinger incredible beauty, combined with some claustrophobic and creepy mine exploring, are still well worth the price of purchase.",3,A little known tunnel crawl with an unusual role for aging Charlton Heston and a stunningly beautiful Kim Basinger,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,2169,"['huge', 'fan', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'was', 'pleased', 'discover', 'finally', 'little', 'known', 'film', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'honest', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'moments', 'nothing', 'more.The', 'whole', 'story', 'somewhere', 'North', 'Canada', 'wilderness', 'pilot', 'named', 'Jean', 'Dupre', 'Nick', 'Mancuso', 'worried', 'disappearance', 'friend', 'George', 'Patterson', 'who', 'was', 'making', 'surveys', 'remote', 'area', 'old', 'DHC-2', 'Beaver', 'floatplane', 'search', 'Patterson', 'girlfriend', 'Andrea', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'will', 'accompany', 'When', 'looking', 'Patterson', 'plane', 'couple', 'meets', 'first', 'old', 'hunter/fisherman', 'Elijah', 'who', 'family', 'wilderness', 'later', 'hermit/miner', 'Silas', 'McGee', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'very', 'friendly', 'probably', 'just', 'little', 'teensy', 'weensy', 'bit', 'crazy', 'Dupre', 'actually', 'combine', 'search', 'prospecting', 'gold', 'will', 'ultimately', 'put', 'Andrea', 'lots', 'trouble', 'will', 'say', 'no', 'more', 'what', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'wilderness', 'very', 'beautiful', 'mine', 'crawling', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'too', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'film', 'clearly', 'enjoyed', 'quite', 'unusual', 'role', 'aging', 'hermit', 'dispensing', 'wisdom', 'inredibly', 'appealing', 'Scottish', 'accent', 'calling', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'lass', 'two', 'minutes', 'so', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'film', 'long', 'golden', 'hair', 'being', 'least', 'opinion', 'real', 'mother', 'lode', 'movie', 'then', 'Elijah', 'John', 'Marley', 'who', 'simply', 'irresistible', 'probably', 'wisest', 'best', 'spoken', 'old', 'timer', 'saw', 'screen', 'long', 'time.However', 'scenario', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'Jean', 'Dupre', 'character', 'kind', 'jerk', 'could', ""n't"", 'identify', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'guilty', 'chemistry', 'himand', 'Andrea', 'who', 'best', 'friend', 'girlfriend', ""coulnd't"", 'detect', 'ending', 'rather', 'unsatisfying.But', 'still', 'do', 'not', 'regret', 'watched', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'talent', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'incredible', 'beauty', 'combined', 'claustrophobic', 'creepy', 'mine', 'exploring', 'are', 'still', 'well', 'price', 'purchase']",Mother Lode VHS

I did have a copy on VHS taped off of cable a few years back but it got drowned by water from a leak in the basement. Let me just echo the sentiments expressed by the reviews before me, please whoever reads these reviews in the entertainment industry, please release this on dvd. It is a classic and a highly underrated film.I know that Charton Heston is best known as Moses, and rightly so, but this role should be re-evaluated and I consider it his most diverse role ever.The reviews that I saw years ago or read about comment about the darkness of the filmmaking, however, given the setting in a remote wilderness and a gold mine, it makes absolutely perfect sense to film it that way.I personally love any movie about the wilderness and it fits perfectly on my list of favorite movies.The supporting cast of Nick Mancuso, Kim Basinger and John Marley as Elijah are just perfect for their roles. This movie contains all of the elements that a movie should, drama, a hint of comedy, adventure,suspense and especially atmosphere.My advice is, if you don't want to wait for a hopefully future DVD release, buy a VHS copy and revel in the moments of a fine film until then.P.S.
