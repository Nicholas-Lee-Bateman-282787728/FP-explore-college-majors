Infidelity played a role in the main characters' marital breakdown, but this movie shows how love, forgiveness and words of wisdom from an older couple can knit a family back together.  What makes it even more special is that it happens all at Christmas time!  Stranded in an airport, headed for different destinations, a blizzard keeps them from traveling and therefore having no other choice but to attack the issue at hand: either stay together and work it out, or serve a petition for divorce. Definitely a feel good movie!",5,Nothing like restoration at Christmas time!,1283731200,"09 6, 2010",2010,606,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'A', 'Chance', 'Snow', 'ever', 'saw', 'TV', 'years', 'ago', 'Infidelity', 'played', 'role', 'main', 'characters', 'marital', 'breakdown', 'movie', 'how', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'words', 'wisdom', 'older', 'couple', 'can', 'knit', 'family', 'back', 'together', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'special', 'Christmas', 'time', 'Stranded', 'airport', 'headed', 'different', 'destinations', 'blizzard', 'traveling', 'therefore', 'having', 'other', 'choice', 'attack', 'issue', 'hand', 'stay', 'together', 'work', 'out', 'serve', 'petition', 'divorce', 'Definitely', 'feel', 'good', 'movie']",A Chance of Snow

Though it is an older movie, and the scenery and photography is very dated, it's message of love and forgiveness is timeless.Having broken his marriage vows, the husband has accepted that his wife will never forgive him and their marriage is over, though they are waiting to tell their 2 young daughters untill after the holidays. When both parents are stranded at the airport in a Christmas Eve snowstorm, they meet an elderly couple who share with them a sweet story of a love that survives betrayal.",4,Love Christmas Movies!,1222732800,"09 30, 2008",2008,587,"['Chance', 'Snow', 'good', 'movie', 'average', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'fanatic', 'older', 'movie', 'scenery', 'photography', 'very', 'dated', 'message', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'timeless.Having', 'broken', 'marriage', 'vows', 'husband', 'accepted', 'wife', 'will', 'never', 'forgive', 'marriage', 'are', 'waiting', 'tell', '2', 'young', 'daughters', 'untill', 'holidays', 'When', 'parents', 'are', 'stranded', 'airport', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'snowstorm', 'meet', 'elderly', 'couple', 'who', 'share', 'sweet', 'story', 'love', 'betrayal']",A Chance of Snow
725099,AQ2UN38CMK119,B00007855E,P. Mann,"[0, 0]","In ""A Chance of Snow,"" Maddie (JoBeth Williams) and Mitch (Michael Ontkean) are a married couple racing toward divorce. He's a sportswriter who strayed from his vows once, and she refuses to forgive. By coincidence, they end up stranded at an airport during a heavy snowstorm, and against the backdrop of thousands of stranded passengers, they quarrel. As it happens, an older couple (the always wonderful Charles Durning and the equally charming Barbara Barrie) decides to try to lend a helping hand and the benefit of years of matrimonial experience.Meanwhile, their two daughters, traveling with their mother, try to come to grips with the idea of their parents' divorcing. Like their parents, the girls receive advice from others, in particular a young boy whose parents are divorced and the girls' maternal grandmother.There are some problems with this film. There seems to be an undercurrent of suggesting the blame for the infidelity lies not with the person who strays but with the spouse. But at the same time, the problems here are created by the characters, and they work them out themselves. There's no especial Christmas magic, no extreme coincidence, and no abject silliness. Indeed, the entire film has almost nothing to do with Christmas except for snow (that that could happen just as easily in February) and there is one Christmas present involved when one of the daughters gives her father a photo album with pictures from when the family was happy.",4,Restoring a marriage,1352937600,"11 15, 2012",2012,1468,"['Chance', 'Snow', 'Maddie', 'JoBeth', 'Williams', 'Mitch', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'are', 'married', 'couple', 'racing', 'divorce', 'sportswriter', 'who', 'strayed', 'vows', 'once', 'forgive', 'coincidence', 'end', 'up', 'stranded', 'airport', 'heavy', 'snowstorm', 'backdrop', 'thousands', 'stranded', 'passengers', 'quarrel', 'older', 'couple', 'always', 'wonderful', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'equally', 'charming', 'Barbara', 'Barrie', 'try', 'lend', 'helping', 'hand', 'benefit', 'years', 'matrimonial', 'experience.Meanwhile', 'two', 'daughters', 'traveling', 'mother', 'try', 'come', 'grips', 'idea', 'parents', 'divorcing', 'parents', 'girls', 'receive', 'advice', 'others', 'particular', 'young', 'boy', 'parents', 'are', 'divorced', 'girls', 'maternal', 'grandmother.There', 'are', 'problems', 'film', 'be', 'undercurrent', 'suggesting', 'blame', 'infidelity', 'not', 'person', 'who', 'spouse', 'same', 'time', 'problems', 'here', 'are', 'created', 'characters', 'work', 'out', 'especial', 'Christmas', 'magic', 'extreme', 'coincidence', 'abject', 'silliness', 'Indeed', 'entire', 'film', 'almost', 'nothing', 'do', 'Christmas', 'snow', 'could', 'happen', 'just', 'easily', 'February', 'one', 'Christmas', 'present', 'involved', 'when', 'one', 'daughters', 'father', 'photo', 'album', 'pictures', 'when', 'family', 'was', 'happy']",A Chance of Snow
