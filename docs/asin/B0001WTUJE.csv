814970,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B0001WTUJE,Andrew Raker,"[1, 1]","Positives:- The film absolutely explores the character of Monks as well as provides other important background information. Monks is portrayed as a hurt, greedy young man, but one with which an audience could sympathize.- The production does an excellent job with Mr. Bumble's and Mrs. Mann's sequences, especially after they are married.- Most of the plot follows logically even though the plot line has been ""twisted.""- Fagin is at least portrayed as a bad-guy as in the novel and unlike in the musical Oliver! or the 2007 BBC production.Negatives:- The first 100 minutes of the film are spend exploring and interpreting 5 to 10 pages of the novel. While I think providing more background information on Edward Leerford and his parents was a positive choice, I wish they would not have spent more than 20 minutes exploring this part.- Rose's character is not sufficiently explored. While she is portrayed as innocent and kind as a child, I really detested the are-you-the-boogie-man-sequence. Children in Rose's class were not idiots in the early 1800s. As soon as Rose saw Edward, she would have screamed and/or ran way. I understand the scene was supposed to play off of Monk's ugliness, but please, burglars have deformities as well as legendary boogie-men.- Oliver is too young in this production. He should be played by an actor who appears at least 12 years old. The Dodger and Charley Bates are played by actors who appear almost adults. This takes away the psychological scenes between Oliver and the Dodger. In other words, there is not reason for Oliver to want the Dodger's acceptance, since the Dodger is like another Bill Sikes rather than an influencial peer of Oliver.-Too many minor characters are eliminated or combined. Another reviewer, HAMLET, explores some of the combinations.- Fagin is too much of a magician with a touch of insanity. In the novel, Fagin is a great psychological manipulator and hardly insane until the end when he is about to be hung.*******************************Overall, the production was interesting to watch.However, I recommend the 1985 adaptation with Eric Porter as Fagin for people who want the story told in the most loyal manner. Unfortunately, the 1985 adaptation is not perfect, either (especially the 4:3 ratio and picture quality). However, it is the most loyal to the novel color production as of 2009.If you really do not want to watch the 1985 adaptation in 4:3 aspect ratio, I would advise the 2005 adaptation starring Ben Kingley and Barney Clark with its 2.35:1 aspect ratio. (Even though this adaptation is seriously abridged, it really conveys the mood of Dickens' novel well.Avoid the 1997 Disney adaptation and the 2007 BBC adaptation.",3,Interesting but takes more liberties than I would have liked.,1245024000,"06 15, 2009",2009,2704,"['Positives', 'film', 'absolutely', 'character', 'Monks', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'important', 'background', 'information', 'Monks', 'portrayed', 'hurt', 'greedy', 'young', 'man', 'one', 'audience', 'could', 'sympathize.-', 'production', 'excellent', 'job', 'Mr.', 'Bumble', 'Mrs.', 'Mann', 'sequences', 'especially', 'are', 'married.-', 'Most', 'plot', 'logically', 'even', 'plot', 'line', 'been', 'twisted', 'Fagin', 'least', 'portrayed', 'bad-guy', 'novel', 'musical', 'Oliver', '2007', 'BBC', 'production.Negatives', 'first', '100', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'spend', 'exploring', 'interpreting', '5', '10', 'pages', 'novel', 'think', 'providing', 'more', 'background', 'information', 'Edward', 'Leerford', 'parents', 'was', 'positive', 'choice', 'wish', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'spent', 'more', '20', 'minutes', 'exploring', 'part.-', 'Rose', 'character', 'not', 'sufficiently', 'explored', 'portrayed', 'innocent', 'kind', 'child', 'really', 'detested', 'are-you-the-boogie-man-sequence', 'Children', 'Rose', 'class', 'were', 'not', 'idiots', 'early', '1800s', 'As', 'soon', 'Rose', 'saw', 'Edward', 'would', 'have', 'screamed', 'and/or', 'ran', 'way', 'understand', 'scene', 'was', 'supposed', 'play', 'Monk', 'ugliness', 'please', 'burglars', 'have', 'deformities', 'as', 'well', 'legendary', 'boogie-men.-', 'Oliver', 'too', 'young', 'production', 'should', 'be', 'played', 'actor', 'who', 'least', '12', 'years', 'old', 'Dodger', 'Charley', 'Bates', 'are', 'played', 'actors', 'who', 'appear', 'almost', 'adults', 'away', 'psychological', 'scenes', 'Oliver', 'Dodger', 'other', 'words', 'not', 'reason', 'Oliver', 'want', 'Dodger', 'acceptance', 'Dodger', 'Bill', 'Sikes', 'rather', 'influencial', 'peer', 'Oliver.-Too', 'many', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'eliminated', 'combined', 'reviewer', 'HAMLET', 'combinations.-', 'Fagin', 'too', 'much', 'magician', 'touch', 'insanity', 'novel', 'Fagin', 'great', 'psychological', 'manipulator', 'hardly', 'insane', 'end', 'when', 'be', 'hung', '*******************************Overall', 'production', 'was', 'interesting', 'watch.However', 'recommend', '1985', 'adaptation', 'Eric', 'Porter', 'Fagin', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'story', 'told', 'most', 'loyal', 'manner', 'Unfortunately', '1985', 'adaptation', 'not', 'perfect', 'either', 'especially', '4:3', 'ratio', 'picture', 'quality', 'However', 'most', 'loyal', 'novel', 'color', 'production', '2009.If', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'watch', '1985', 'adaptation', '4:3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'would', 'advise', '2005', 'adaptation', 'starring', 'Ben', 'Kingley', 'Barney', 'Clark', '2.35:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Even', 'adaptation', 'seriously', 'abridged', 'really', 'mood', 'Dickens', 'novel', '1997', 'Disney', 'adaptation', '2007', 'BBC', 'adaptation']",N/A

Why it was made 360 minutes is a shameful matter even if making it an even 6 hours is the excuse.  Anyway, the region 2 is longer at 386 minutes, as marked on my dvd set, and why anyone would cut it is beyond me.In my opinion, pitifully without motivations of perfection, this is alright, but the British full length is likely better for those who read the original books.Yes, there are modifactions and embellisments but I consider them in the spirit of Dickens.  The themes are there for those who perceive them.

814972,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B0001WTUJE,Byron Kolln,"[0, 0]","For my money, at least, this 1999 miniseries is the DEFINITIVE screen version of Dickens' OLIVER TWIST.  Comprising four 95-minute instalments, the story plays out in great detail but the action is fast-paced and the performances are sublime - evoking all of the comedy and terror of some of Charles Dickens' greatest character creations.The first 95 minutes are dedicated to the events leading up to Oliver's birth.  Agnes Fleming (Sophia Myles) is desperately in love with Edwin Leeford (Tim Dutton) and the feeling is entirely mutual, however, unbeknownst to Agnes, Leeford is still legally married to another woman - although long-estranged - and she is in no hurry to give him up.  Once Leeford inherits a great fortune in Rome, his wife Elizabeth (Lindsay Duncan) and sickly, epileptic son Edward, later known as Monks (Marc Warren), pounce and his fate is sealed.  Back in England, Agnes can no longer keep her pregnancy secret, and is sent into the countryside for a discreet confinement.  Hot on her trail, Elizabeth and Monks set off to destroy both mother and unborn child - their only roadblocks to inheriting the whole of Leeford's estate.The story then follows the familiar tale of the orphaned Oliver (played with great charm and  sensitivity by Sam Smith), the boy who asked for more at the Workhouse, only to be sold off to an undertaker (Roger Lloyd-Pack), and later taken in by Fagin (Robert Lindsay) and his den of child thieves.  How Oliver winds up in the care of kindly Mr Brownlow (Michael Kitchen) isn't so much coincidence in this version, given his connection to the events surrounding Agnes and Leeford.  Brownlow is also the legal guardian of Agnes' younger sister Rose (Keira Knightley) - Oliver's aunt.I've seen many versions of the story (and throughout childhood appeared in a few productions of Lionel Bart's musical version) but this 1999 TV adaptation had me absorbed in the action as through I was discovering it all for the very first time all over again.  I first ran into one of the episodes whilst channel-surfing one afternoon, and from there I was hooked.  I simply had to buy the DVD.The performances are absolute perfection right down the line.  Robert Lindsay is both benign father figure and menacing magician as Fagin (one of his best ever portrayals).  As the tragic Nancy, Emily Woof is a real heartbreaker.  Andy Serkis is making something of a career speciality playing the Dickens villains (he has most recently portrayed Rigaud in the BBC's 2008 mounting ofLittle Dorrit) and as Bill Sikes he is truly chilling.  Lindsay Duncan follows suit with her macabre Elizabeth Leeford, whilst Marc Warren just about walks away with the whole miniseries as Monks.This DVD edition from PBS/Masterpiece Theatre is, I'm sad to report, edited from the original broadcast version (nothing terribly major but those who've seen it a few times will be able to tell what is missing).

It's just so shattering, so beautiful, so emotionally exhausting to watch.  It's one of those movies that are so good that you forget you're really watching a bunch of actors, with lights, cameras, clapboards, etc.  You find yourself totally immersed.One thing you should know is that, whether you get this movie on DVD or on VHS, there are three parts, each about 2 hours.Surprisingly, though, only the second and third parts are, strictly speaking, adapted from Dickens's novel.  The first part is the prequel:  in the novel, the exact circumstances of Twist's provenance are left murky.  The first part of this series, made only for this ""Masterpiece Theatre"" production, is a two-hour spelling out of where he came from.  They've definitely taken some license there.But incredibly, the first part -- the one not based directly on Dickens's writings -- is for me the most gripping and well-written of the three!  I can't believe how good it is.  Fits right in and then some.One other note:  I'm probably not giving away anything by announcing that in the end, everything is set right and just desserts are apportioned to all.  Yet so crushing and infuriating is the Hell through which the waif Oliver must pass, that one is left to wonder if, even though the bad guys do get what's coming to them, the horrors we have seen are really made up for.To tell you the truth, notwithstanding my regard for this production, I find myself unable to sit through it a second time.  The actors playing Monks, Bill, and Fagin do such a convincing, harrowing job of being evil to Oliver, that I simply can't take it, even though I know everything will be all right in the end.  It's just too much for me.I also find this true of the book.  It's probably the only work of Dickens that leaves me with the feeling, when I put it back on the shelf, that the moral universe is still fundamentally out of whack.",5,supernal,1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,2078,"['Having', 'life', 'make', 'point', 'trying', 'see', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'BBC-type', 'historical', 'drama', 'can.And', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'probably', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'just', 'so', 'shattering', 'so', 'beautiful', 'so', 'emotionally', 'exhausting', 'watch', 'one', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'forget', ""'re"", 'really', 'watching', 'bunch', 'actors', 'lights', 'cameras', 'clapboards', 'etc', 'find', 'totally', 'immersed.One', 'thing', 'should', 'know', 'get', 'movie', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'are', 'three', 'parts', '2', 'hours.Surprisingly', 'though', 'only', 'second', 'third', 'parts', 'are', 'strictly', 'speaking', 'adapted', 'Dickens', 'novel', 'first', 'part', 'prequel', 'novel', 'exact', 'circumstances', 'Twist', 'provenance', 'are', 'left', 'murky', 'first', 'part', 'series', 'made', 'only', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'production', 'two-hour', 'spelling', 'where', 'came', ""'ve"", 'definitely', 'taken', 'license', 'there.But', 'incredibly', 'first', 'part', 'one', 'not', 'based', 'directly', 'Dickens', 'writings', 'most', 'gripping', 'well-written', 'three', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'good', 'Fits', 'right', 'then', 'some.One', 'other', 'note', ""'m"", 'probably', 'not', 'giving', 'away', 'anything', 'announcing', 'end', 'everything', 'set', 'right', 'just', 'desserts', 'are', 'apportioned', 'so', 'crushing', 'infuriating', 'Hell', 'waif', 'Oliver', 'must', 'pass', 'one', 'left', 'wonder', 'even', 'bad', 'guys', 'do', 'get', 'what', 'coming', 'horrors', 'have', 'seen', 'are', 'really', 'made', 'up', 'for.To', 'tell', 'truth', 'notwithstanding', 'regard', 'production', 'find', 'unable', 'sit', 'second', 'time', 'actors', 'playing', 'Monks', 'Bill', 'Fagin', 'do', 'convincing', 'harrowing', 'job', 'being', 'evil', 'Oliver', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'even', 'know', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'right', 'end', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'me.I', 'also', 'find', 'true', 'book', 'probably', 'only', 'work', 'Dickens', 'feeling', 'when', 'put', 'back', 'shelf', 'moral', 'universe', 'still', 'fundamentally', 'whack']",N/A
814974,A1PCESNDC808ZM,B0001WTUJE,Charles Griffin,"[3, 3]","I decided to buy this on DVD and compare it to the recent version of Oliver Twist that just played on Masterpiece Theater with Timothy Spall. Wow! I thought that one was good, but this one is the best I've seen.I must start with the performance of Marc Warren as Edward Leeford. He took a character I couldn't have cared less about in other versions and painted a heartbreaking portrait of a disturbed human being.I actually love Robert Lindsay's take on Fagin. From his look to his voice, he's a perfect physical interpretation of the character. Sure, the incorporation of magic into Fagin's background isn't exactly faithful to the book, but I like how it adds a bit of flavor and flamboyance to the him. While other versions have started making Fagin more sympathetic, this mini-series chose to stay reasonably faithful to the more flawed aspects of Fagin. Great job by both the filmakers and Lindsay. (Timothy Spall in the newest version is an interesting choice and very quirky. But I feel like I'm watching the true Fagin with Lindsay)I was looking forward to Andy Serkis' Bill Sikes and he was appropriately scary. He's certainly physically brutal and not one you'd want to cross. I thought Serkis might add more layers to the character, but apparently not. In truth, it's difficult to turn a character so evil into anything more than a monster.Julie Walters and David Ross do a fine job as Mrs. Mann and Mr. Bumble. I have to admit, however, I grew less interested everytime their characters appeared onscreen. Not the actors' fault. I just kept asking myself, ""Why do we keep going back to these two?"" Of course, they do become fairly important later on.Sam Smith is pretty much the sort of kid I see when I think of Oliver Twist in terms of his angelic look. But I also liked his performance overall and the way he responded to others by making comments sometimes under his breath. Keira Knightly's Rose (who looks shockingly older than her actual age in this) is almost as heartwarming as Emily Woof's Nancy is heartbreaking. Also Michael Kitchen is a joy as Mr. Brownlow, as is Annette Crosbie as Mrs Bedwin. I don't want to forget Sophia Myles who really brings Oliver's mother to life.This brings me to episode one of the mini-series, which is essentially the prequel to the more familiar story. It really ties together questions I probably had when watching other versions of the story. When I heard part one was entirely before the famous workhouse chapter, I was concerned. But Myles, Kitchen and Warren really make it work.I was touched almost to tears when Oliver relays his story to Rose and Mr. Brownlow while lying in bed. Also when Oliver feels sympathy for Edward.While the mini-series apparently takes a few liberties with Dicken's original story, it's very faithful compared to most versions and beautifully done.",5,Best I've yet seen of the Twist tale!,1235433600,"02 24, 2009",2009,2839,"['decided', 'buy', 'DVD', 'compare', 'recent', 'version', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'just', 'played', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Wow', 'thought', 'one', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen.I', 'must', 'start', 'performance', 'Marc', 'Warren', 'Edward', 'Leeford', 'took', 'character', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'other', 'versions', 'painted', 'heartbreaking', 'portrait', 'disturbed', 'human', 'being.I', 'actually', 'love', 'Robert', 'Lindsay', 'take', 'Fagin', 'look', 'voice', 'perfect', 'physical', 'interpretation', 'character', 'Sure', 'incorporation', 'magic', 'Fagin', 'background', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'faithful', 'book', 'like', 'how', 'bit', 'flavor', 'flamboyance', 'other', 'versions', 'have', 'started', 'making', 'Fagin', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'mini-series', 'chose', 'stay', 'reasonably', 'faithful', 'more', 'flawed', 'aspects', 'Fagin', 'Great', 'job', 'filmakers', 'Lindsay', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'newest', 'version', 'interesting', 'choice', 'very', 'quirky', 'feel', ""'m"", 'watching', 'true', 'Fagin', 'Lindsay', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'Bill', 'Sikes', 'was', 'appropriately', 'scary', 'certainly', 'physically', 'brutal', 'not', 'one', ""'d"", 'want', 'cross', 'thought', 'Serkis', 'might', 'add', 'more', 'layers', 'character', 'apparently', 'not', 'truth', 'difficult', 'turn', 'character', 'so', 'evil', 'anything', 'more', 'monster.Julie', 'Walters', 'David', 'Ross', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'Mrs.', 'Mann', 'Mr.', 'Bumble', 'have', 'admit', 'however', 'grew', 'less', 'interested', 'characters', 'appeared', 'onscreen', 'Not', 'actors', 'fault', 'just', 'kept', 'asking', 'Why', 'do', 'keep', 'going', 'back', 'two', 'course', 'do', 'become', 'fairly', 'important', 'later', 'on.Sam', 'Smith', 'pretty', 'much', 'sort', 'kid', 'see', 'when', 'think', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'terms', 'angelic', 'look', 'also', 'liked', 'performance', 'overall', 'way', 'responded', 'others', 'making', 'comments', 'sometimes', 'breath', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'Rose', 'who', 'shockingly', 'older', 'actual', 'age', 'almost', 'as', 'heartwarming', 'Emily', 'Woof', 'Nancy', 'heartbreaking', 'Also', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'joy', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow', 'Annette', 'Crosbie', 'Mrs', 'Bedwin', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'forget', 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'who', 'really', 'Oliver', 'mother', 'life.This', 'brings', 'episode', 'one', 'mini-series', 'essentially', 'prequel', 'more', 'familiar', 'story', 'really', 'together', 'questions', 'probably', 'had', 'when', 'watching', 'other', 'versions', 'story', 'When', 'heard', 'part', 'one', 'was', 'entirely', 'famous', 'workhouse', 'chapter', 'was', 'concerned', 'Myles', 'Kitchen', 'Warren', 'really', 'make', 'was', 'touched', 'almost', 'tears', 'when', 'Oliver', 'story', 'Rose', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow', 'lying', 'bed', 'Also', 'when', 'Oliver', 'sympathy', 'Edward.While', 'mini-series', 'apparently', 'few', 'liberties', 'Dicken', 'original', 'story', 'very', 'faithful', 'compared', 'most', 'versions', 'beautifully', 'done']",N/A

Then, I realized, upon seeing a scene from this series on YouTube, that this was probably the first version to include Rose Maylie, a character often cut from movie & TV versions of the story (I'd grown up seeing the 1968 musical ""Oliver!,"" which is a classic, and had also seen the Disney made-for-TV version) and wonderedhow the filmmakers had handled her character in this version. Upon learning that Kiera Knightley played Rose, I was the more enthusiastic, as I had seen her in the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" movies, ""STAR WARS Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" and ""Pride & Prejudice.""Ultimately, I was diasppointed. Though the decision to flesh out Oliver's baxkstory for 98% of the 1st episode was a brave one, so much of it was out of sync with the novel that at times I wondered if this was really based on ""Oliver Twist, Or The Parish Boy's Progress"" (the original title of the story when it was serialized in ""Bentley's Miscellany"" in 1837). The entire mini-series (6 hours split onto 3 discs) altered much of what was left of the novel. Some examples follow (with possible spoilers). While not a complete listing of the vast liberties taken with the novel, these are some of the most blatant.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MINI-SERIES.In the novel: Monks & Oliver's father dies of a mysterious ailment.In the mini-series: Monks' mother kills his father and watches as he dies.In the novel: Mrs. Maylie & Mrs. Bedwin are two separate characters who befriend Oliver.In the mini-series: Mrs. Maylie & Mrs. Bedwin are combined into one character.In the novel: Doctor Losberne is an old man and Harry Maylie is Mrs. Maylie's son & Rose's suitor.In the mini-series: Doctor Losberne & Harry Maylie are combined into one character.In the novel: Sikes accidntally hangs himself.In the mini-series: Sikes commits suicide.In the novel: Mr. Brownlow was not only an old man, but he never knew Rose personally until she came to him on Nancy & Oliver's behalf.In the mini-series: Mr. Brownlow is depicted as a middle-aged man AND as Rose's guardian.This last deviation REALLY IRKED me.In the novel: Rose intereacts more with Oliver.In the mini-series: Rose barely spoke with Oliver (not Ms. Knightley's fault; it was the screenwriter's fault); in addition, there was hardly any emotion when a secret involving both of them was revealed (again, it was entirely the screenwriter's fault).When aired on TV in 2002, it was rated TV-PG for violence. Actually, the mini-series is Not Rated. I enjoyed it, as a period piece and, of course, because of Kiera Knightley (who was, I deeply feel, sorely underused).",3,"Interesting Version Of A Classic Story, But Ultimately A Mixed Bag Of A Mini-Series.",1215820800,"07 12, 2008",2008,2727,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'mini-series', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'Why', 'film', 'version', 'story', 'Then', 'realized', 'seeing', 'scene', 'series', 'YouTube', 'was', 'probably', 'first', 'version', 'include', 'Rose', 'Maylie', 'character', 'often', 'cut', 'movie', 'TV', 'versions', 'story', ""'d"", 'grown', 'up', 'seeing', '1968', 'musical', 'Oliver', 'classic', 'had', 'also', 'seen', 'Disney', 'made-for-TV', 'version', 'wonderedhow', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'handled', 'character', 'version', 'learning', 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'played', 'Rose', 'was', 'more', 'enthusiastic', 'had', 'seen', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'movies', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'Episode', 'Phantom', 'Menace', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Ultimately', 'was', 'diasppointed', 'decision', 'flesh', 'out', 'Oliver', 'baxkstory', '98', '%', '1st', 'episode', 'was', 'brave', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'sync', 'novel', 'times', 'wondered', 'was', 'really', 'based', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'Or', 'Parish', 'Boy', 'Progress', 'original', 'title', 'story', 'when', 'was', 'serialized', 'Bentley', 'Miscellany', '1837', 'entire', 'mini-series', '6', 'hours', 'split', '3', 'discs', 'altered', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'left', 'novel', 'examples', 'follow', 'possible', 'spoilers', 'not', 'complete', 'listing', 'vast', 'liberties', 'taken', 'novel', 'are', 'most', 'blatant.SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'DO', 'NOT', 'READ', 'IF', 'YOU', 'HAVE', ""N'T"", 'SEEN', 'THE', 'MINI-SERIES.In', 'novel', 'Monks', 'Oliver', 'father', 'dies', 'mysterious', 'mini-series', 'Monks', 'mother', 'father', 'watches', 'novel', 'Mrs.', 'Maylie', 'Mrs.', 'Bedwin', 'are', 'two', 'separate', 'characters', 'who', 'befriend', 'mini-series', 'Mrs.', 'Maylie', 'Mrs.', 'Bedwin', 'are', 'combined', 'one', 'character.In', 'novel', 'Doctor', 'Losberne', 'old', 'man', 'Harry', 'Maylie', 'Mrs.', 'Maylie', 'son', 'Rose', 'suitor.In', 'mini-series', 'Doctor', 'Losberne', 'Harry', 'Maylie', 'are', 'combined', 'one', 'character.In', 'novel', 'Sikes', 'accidntally', 'himself.In', 'mini-series', 'Sikes', 'commits', 'suicide.In', 'novel', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'old', 'man', 'never', 'knew', 'Rose', 'personally', 'came', 'Nancy', 'Oliver', 'behalf.In', 'mini-series', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow', 'depicted', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'Rose', 'guardian.This', 'last', 'deviation', 'REALLY', 'IRKED', 'me.In', 'novel', 'Rose', 'intereacts', 'more', 'Oliver.In', 'mini-series', 'Rose', 'barely', 'spoke', 'Oliver', 'not', 'Ms.', 'Knightley', 'fault', 'was', 'screenwriter', 'fault', 'addition', 'was', 'hardly', 'emotion', 'when', 'secret', 'involving', 'was', 'revealed', 'again', 'was', 'entirely', 'screenwriter', 'fault', 'aired', 'TV', '2002', 'was', 'rated', 'TV-PG', 'violence', 'Actually', 'mini-series', 'Not', 'Rated', 'enjoyed', 'period', 'piece', 'course', 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'who', 'was', 'deeply', 'feel', 'sorely', 'underused']",N/A

This is my favorite put-to-film Dickens novel (except for the various ""A Christmas Carol's"" out there), and I am ecstatic that this version is finally available on DVD.Now, in this adaption, I believe the prequel works very well. I think it makes this a much more comprehensive movie and gives the characters involved (especially Monks) much more depth. And, because of the length of this version that I am reviewing, it allows the viewer to get to know each character much deeper than the other filmed versions available. We get to know Oliver's parents and Aunt Rose up close, although it is done through liberties taken by the producer and not necessarily Dickens himself. I do feel, however, the great novelist would not particularly mind in this case.The acting is as good, if not better, than pretty much most period epics I have seen. The actors play off of each other well - they match their roles perfectly. The costumes and sets are excellent. They have captured the early Victorian period so well  - both the good and the bad - it's almost as if the viewer is peering through a looking glass into the past.As for the story following Dickens' original novel...well, I have yet to see any movie follow a novel to a ""T."" It just doesn't happen, unfortunately, with virtually any put-to-film novel. But this follows the original, as a whole, much much closer than the other versions I have seen - definitely more than ""Oliver,"" and infinitely more than the Disney version with Richard Dreyfuss, which was made into a totally different story than what Dickens had intended.Don't let the nearly 6 hour length scare you off - there is no time during this whole version where one is bored (unless they are a child - definitely not a children's movie!).

Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[0, 0]","My first observation is that the film provided incredible insights into life in the age of Oliver Twist - the early 1800s. The large number of orphans, perverted justice, upper-class snobbery and meanness, and the callousness of the lower classes all comes through.The story itself is a masterpiece. Oliver is born to an unmarried woman who dies after giving birth, and then placed in a workhouse. He's sold for asking for more food (gruel with a few worms), but ends up in an even worse situation - taunted by an older apprentice in the undertaker's family. Oliver leaves after attacking his taunter when his mother's character is attacked, then accidentally falls in with a band of young thieves. There he's treated well, but arrested and sentenced to death for stealing - actually committed by another gang member. Fortunately, the victim realizes the error and rescues Oliver.Oliver is now very well treated and appreciated, but unfortunately (re)captured by the gang - its leader is worried Oliver will tell on them. Eventually everything gets sorted out and Oliver finds his aunt and a loving home - despite a rich heir trying to have Oliver killed because he would have to split the inheritance with him.",5,Outstanding -,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,1211,"['first', 'observation', 'film', 'provided', 'incredible', 'insights', 'life', 'age', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'early', '1800s', 'large', 'number', 'orphans', 'perverted', 'justice', 'upper-class', 'snobbery', 'meanness', 'callousness', 'lower', 'classes', 'through.The', 'story', 'masterpiece', 'Oliver', 'born', 'unmarried', 'woman', 'who', 'giving', 'birth', 'then', 'placed', 'workhouse', 'sold', 'asking', 'more', 'food', 'gruel', 'few', 'worms', 'up', 'even', 'worse', 'situation', 'taunted', 'older', 'apprentice', 'undertaker', 'family', 'Oliver', 'attacking', 'taunter', 'when', 'mother', 'character', 'attacked', 'then', 'accidentally', 'band', 'young', 'thieves', 'treated', 'well', 'arrested', 'sentenced', 'death', 'stealing', 'actually', 'committed', 'gang', 'member', 'Fortunately', 'victim', 'error', 'rescues', 'Oliver.Oliver', 'now', 'very', 'well', 'treated', 'appreciated', 'unfortunately', 're', 'captured', 'gang', 'leader', 'worried', 'Oliver', 'will', 'tell', 'Eventually', 'everything', 'sorted', 'out', 'Oliver', 'aunt', 'loving', 'home', 'rich', 'heir', 'trying', 'have', 'Oliver', 'killed', 'would', 'have', 'split', 'inheritance']",N/A

The characters are realistic, interesting, people you don't meet everyday. Never a dull moment. You are taken to another time and place of adventure.The 1948 version is best version with John Howard Davies as Oliver and Alec Guinness as Fagin, and John Newton as Bill. This 1999 version at 6-hours long is much longer than the other versions. The 1948 version is 2-hours long. This 1999 version spends a couple of hours telling about the romance between Oliver's parents, which is interesting, and which the other versions leave out. However, the 1948 version is much better cast and much more gripping. The 1933 version with Dickie Moore is not nearly as good as any of the other versions. I have seen other versions and liked them too. If you like this; Charles Dickens wrote the book upon which this DVD is based; also wrote the classics ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""David Copperfield"" also on DVD.Other great period, adventure movies are ""Tom Brown's School Days 1935"", ""David Copperfield 1940 & 2000"", ""The Prince & the Pauper"", ""At Swords Point 1952"", ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer 1938"", ""The Three Musketeers 1939"", and ""The Scarlet Pimpernel 1935"".",5,A good adventure.,1155945600,"08 19, 2006",2006,1250,"['Oliver', 'Twist', 'great', 'adventure', 'story', 'struggles', 'poor', 'boy', 'England', '1800', 'characters', 'are', 'realistic', 'interesting', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'meet', 'everyday', 'dull', 'moment', 'are', 'taken', 'time', 'place', 'adventure.The', '1948', 'version', 'best', 'version', 'John', 'Howard', 'Davies', 'Oliver', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'Fagin', 'John', 'Newton', 'Bill', '1999', 'version', '6-hours', 'long', 'much', 'longer', 'other', 'versions', '1948', 'version', '2-hours', 'long', '1999', 'version', 'couple', 'hours', 'telling', 'romance', 'Oliver', 'parents', 'interesting', 'other', 'versions', 'leave', 'out', 'However', '1948', 'version', 'much', 'better', 'cast', 'much', 'more', 'gripping', '1933', 'version', 'Dickie', 'Moore', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'versions', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'versions', 'liked', 'too', 'like', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'wrote', 'book', 'DVD', 'based', 'also', 'wrote', 'classics', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'David', 'Copperfield', 'also', 'DVD.Other', 'great', 'period', 'adventure', 'movies', 'are', 'Tom', 'Brown', 'School', 'Days', '1935', 'David', 'Copperfield', '1940', '2000', 'Prince', 'Pauper', 'Swords', 'Point', '1952', 'Adventures', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', '1938', 'Three', 'Musketeers', '1939', 'Scarlet', 'Pimpernel', '1935']",N/A

(Andy Serkis is especially loathsome as Bill Sykes.)  However, the television ""adaptation"" merely borrows some characters and situations from the novel.  All of the first 90 minute episode takes place before the novel even begins.  It's interesting, and entertaining, to see what the script writer has made of the pre-history of young Oliver Twist.  But after he enters on the scene in the second episode, the drama strays farther and farther from the story Dickens wrote.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, as the story this film tells is a good story, and well told.  It's just not Dickens.  It bears a resemblence to Dickens, but only such resemblence as chicken soup bears to the roasted fowl.  Whilst wholesome and tasty, it's not the same thing.Enjoy this for what it is, but look for the older BBC dramatisation for a truer representation of Dicken's novel.(Note:  my review is based on the ITV version as released in the UK.
