1145785,A1Q80YGJMUTQNR,B0014BQR3I,Carrie,"[3, 3]","What a great show!  Love to see those jeeps running circles around the German halftracks and tanks.  Unrealistic for sure, but still fun.I watched the show in the sixties as a teenager and enjoyed it, enjoyed even more MAD magazine's hilarious parody of it ""The Ratpacktrol"" which neatly summarized every one of the show's shortcomings. (Issue #114 October 1967)But I still loved the show and when WGN started showing it after baseball games in the late 1990s I got hooked on it again, to the point of getting really irritated when games went into extra innings and preempted the Rat Patrol!  My kids thought I was nuts.So when I found the entire 58 episodes available on DVD, I was quick to order it, although I wondered if I would still find that guilty pleasure watching the show.Oh yeah, I do.  The DVDs are remarkably good quality, far better than the reruns I remember on WGN.  The plotlines are still just as unreal of course, and this is apparent when you watch one episode after another as I have done. And of course the re-use of footage is kind of amusing, especially when the truck lumbering off into the distance is the same one you've seen half a dozen times before.But so what?  Love the jeeps!  Love the way the guys risk life and limb week after week to rescue one another from improbable escapades!  Love to watch Dietrich stand shaking his head at the end of the show after the Rat Patrol pulls off another dumb stunt!  Love to hear Troy growl ""Shake it!""  And Moffit to say smugly ""Piece of cake!"" after another impossible mission.  And Hitch saying to Troy reproachfully ""Who was there, Sarge--you or me?""  And Tully--well, he didn't say much.  But he did chew a mean matchstick.My dad's favorite was Combat and he was in France during WWII, so he should know, but for me it is Rat Patrol.Airborne jeeps!  Manly guys blowing things up!

We are both in our 50's and remember watching the series as teens- It was her favorite series growing up.  The DVD collection is very well made and she especially enjoys the sound reproduction and picture, especially on our big screen LCD TV- very well done reproduction.  This is a great price for the entire collection- you cannot beat the Amazon pricing.  Often the DVD's of the old series just doesn't cut it- either the picture quality or sound quality or both suffer, not the case with this collection.  She has viewed every episode and I am through most of them.  Great way to kick back and relax watching an old series.  Christopher George and Eric Braeden were terrific and cast perfectly for their roles.  Sadly, George succumbed to cancer at a young age, but Eric Braeden is still very much active and everywhere on daytime TV.  He was very young when this series was made, yet they did a great job making him an older Nazi tank commander- very convincing role.  Enjoy!  Oh yeah, forgot to mention, the price for this entire series is a dollar more than what is charged for each individual season (1 and 2).

I'm only on the second disk (8 episodes per disk each about a 1/2 hour) but I must say that I've enjoyed every minute and am impress with the picture quality for such an old series. Each episode is about 1/2 hour so the stories move quickly and often seem to jump ahead but it works. Do you really need an indepth conversation as to why the group is attacking the enemy during war? Some of the episodes are ridiculously simplistic (four guys walking into an enemy camp in broad daylight, through the front gate, with guns drawn, managing to place explosives in the ammo dump, then escaping unharmed) but this series is fictional entertainment not true stories. I also found it refreshing that there is no gore or disturbing images that are so prevailent in the series and movies today. Yes, it is a war series and people get shot and die but you don't see gaping holes in the body with blood and guts gushing out. It's more like watching you kids play war, or cops and robbers, or cowboys and indians. They get shot, they fall down, their dead; that's it. I also found it interesting in the episode I watch last night that they had a run in with muslem radicals trying to kill anyone that didn't convert to their religious beliefs, sound familiar?As I said earlier, the picture quality is great as is the audio.

1145807,A29HVOSR9VLFKP,B0014BQR3I,Mike  Silverman,"[13, 14]","Good Stuff, well worth watching.  The series starts out a little slow but picks up speed by the third episode.  The stories are excellent, dramatic, exciting. Although..., some of the action is a little too unrealistic to believe. German guards and soldiers occasionally fall down a little too easily. Also, the scoring seems a little too upbeat and cheerful at times considering the circumstances of the war.The characters are excellent, very well portrayed, you grow to care about what happens to them as individuals in the course of the series, particularly Seargents Troy and Moffit. Dietrich, the Captain commanding the German forces in the area seems at times to be a little too easily duped to be in charge of all the artillery and vehicles and troops that he handles.  But the doubtful spots seem to get ironed out as the series progresses. The episodes become better with more thought given to how things might have really played out, and given the half-hour format the show does a remarkable job of presenting a full mission story in that limited time frame.Some of the best episodes are directed individually by John Peyser and Sutton Roley both who also directed various episodes of the Combat! series.  In fact if you have not watched the ""Combat!"" series already I recommed getting that one first, every episode of it is a five star production and there were a long line of very famous guest stars.  Follow up that series with this one. Together they provide the best collection of high action WWII televsion series dramas produced in retro era TV.The disks worked well , except for one disk which had a vibration problem, it would not align correctly in the player and caused a slight buzzing , although it corrected itself during actual play of the episode. but the buzzing returned when an episode was not playing on that disk.  Strange.  I'm not sure what caused it, but it was only on one disk and could be watched regardless.  The quality of the transfer is excellent, the color and sound were top notch.- Mike S.",5,GREAT WWII ACTION,1267660800,"03 4, 2010",2010,2033,"['Good', 'Stuff', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'series', 'out', 'little', 'slow', 'up', 'speed', 'third', 'episode', 'stories', 'are', 'excellent', 'dramatic', 'exciting', 'action', 'little', 'too', 'unrealistic', 'believe', 'German', 'guards', 'soldiers', 'occasionally', 'fall', 'down', 'little', 'too', 'easily', 'Also', 'scoring', 'little', 'too', 'upbeat', 'cheerful', 'times', 'considering', 'circumstances', 'war.The', 'characters', 'are', 'excellent', 'very', 'well', 'portrayed', 'grow', 'care', 'what', 'individuals', 'course', 'series', 'particularly', 'Seargents', 'Troy', 'Moffit', 'Dietrich', 'Captain', 'commanding', 'German', 'forces', 'area', 'times', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'easily', 'duped', 'be', 'charge', 'artillery', 'vehicles', 'troops', 'doubtful', 'spots', 'seem', 'get', 'ironed', 'out', 'series', 'episodes', 'become', 'better', 'more', 'thought', 'given', 'how', 'things', 'might', 'have', 'really', 'played', 'out', 'given', 'half-hour', 'format', 'show', 'remarkable', 'job', 'presenting', 'full', 'mission', 'story', 'limited', 'time', 'frame.Some', 'best', 'episodes', 'are', 'directed', 'individually', 'John', 'Peyser', 'Sutton', 'Roley', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'various', 'episodes', 'Combat', 'series', 'fact', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'Combat', 'series', 'already', 'recommed', 'getting', 'one', 'first', 'episode', 'five', 'star', 'production', 'were', 'long', 'line', 'very', 'famous', 'guest', 'stars', 'Follow', 'up', 'series', 'one', 'Together', 'provide', 'best', 'collection', 'high', 'action', 'WWII', 'televsion', 'series', 'dramas', 'produced', 'retro', 'era', 'TV.The', 'disks', 'worked', 'well', 'one', 'disk', 'had', 'vibration', 'problem', 'would', 'not', 'align', 'correctly', 'player', 'caused', 'slight', 'buzzing', 'corrected', 'actual', 'play', 'episode', 'buzzing', 'returned', 'when', 'episode', 'was', 'not', 'playing', 'disk', 'Strange', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'caused', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'disk', 'could', 'be', 'watched', 'regardless', 'quality', 'transfer', 'excellent', 'color', 'sound', 'were', 'top', 'notch.-', 'Mike', 'S']",The Rat Patrol: The Complete Series

1145826,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0014BQR3I,trebe,"[124, 131]","For two seasons on ABC, The Rat Patrol gave viewers a thrilling taste of the war in the desert, as an extremely mobile four man team, took on the forces of Germany's Afrika Korps.  Flying across the desert sands in jeeps armed with fifty caliber machine guns, the Rat Patrol could strike quickly, and were capable of delivering extreme firepower from almost any angle.The Allied invasion of Sicily and Italy, would not have been possible without a secure footing in North Africa.  But in the grand scheme of World War II, the war in North Africa is often overlooked.  The Rat Patrol is the only prime time American series to be set exclusively in the North African theater.  Created by Tom Gries, this fast paced, action packed drama, is all about delivering excitement, suspense, and thrills.  The Rat Patrol consists of Sergeant Sam Troy (Christopher George), and privates Mark Hitchcock (Lawrence Casey) and Tully Pettigrew (Justin Tarr) of the US Army, and Sergeant Jack Moffitt (Gary Raymond) of the British Army, Scots Guard.The production values of The Rat Patrol are generally outstanding, and some scenes look like they could be from a feature film.  In the first season, about half the episodes were filmed in Spain, and featured some spectacular scenes in the desert, and other Spanish locales.  The opening title sequence, features some examples, opening with thrilling images of jeeps flying over a sand dune (and a stuntman almost breaking his neck from whiplash), and a tremendous wide aerial shot of the jeeps racing across the desert, all to Dominic Frontiere's magnificent theme music.  The episodes shot in Spain were quite special, but production costs apparently caused the program to be relocated to America.  The second season was filmed exclusively in California, and while the geography of the desert is not the same, and the cinematography may not be as breathtaking, it is often still very impressive.  The large amount of shooting done on location, or on the studio lot, as opposed to a sterile indoor set, adds to the realistic look of the program.  The staging and execution of many of the battle scenes is remarkably well done, given the budgetary limitations, and availability of equipment.  In general, the stuntwork is outstanding.  To save costs, battle footage and scenic shots were reused where possible, which required creative editing to produce acceptable looking results.The episodes are all entitled as some kind of `raid'.  Often a crisis will arise that briefly slows things down, setting the stage for an exciting and often explosive conclusion.  It is a simple, but effective formula, that works time and again.  The Rat Patrol is not big on sentimentality.  There is death and tragedy, but it simply isn't dwelt upon, and character development isn't very deep.  There are a couple of forays into personal lives, but romance is not something the series writers are very adept at.Although the level of entertainment is high, the level of historical accuracy is probably low.  However the writers clearly understood that two jeeps could not take on an army, and kept the battles to a realistic scale.  There are some missteps, but for the most part the missions are credible, and totally outrageous situations are avoided.  You won't find Troy and the boys trying to kidnap Rommel, or steal the secret of the atomic bomb.Troy was as tough as iron, and his leadership truly held the group together.  The Rat Patrol, made Christopher George a star, but tragically an injury he suffered to his heart, when a jeep flipped over during production, ultimately contributed to his untimely death in 1983 at age 52.  George was married to actress Lynda Day George (Mission Impossible TV series), and Vanna White was his niece.Sergeant Moffitt's ability to speak German, was invaluable to the team.  His father was an archeologist, and having spent much time there, Moffitt had supposedly acquired specialized knowledge about the desert.  This expertise was tapped into a few times in the early episodes, but faded from storylines later on.Hans Gudegast (Eric Braeden) was born in Germany, and as Hauptmann Hans Dietrich of the Afrika Korps, he brought realism to his role, and dignity and character, to the opposing force.  Without Dietrich, or the occasional guest star playing an officer, the Germans are mostly indistinct battle fodder.  Dietrich's presence meant that the battle would be an honorable one.  An ethical man, Dietrich was troubled by the fanatical side of Nazism.  Tall, handsome, and with a deep rich voice, Eric Braeden is also well known for playing Victor Newman for more than twenty years, on the soap The Young and the Restless.Whether it be racing across the sands under a blazing sun, with machine guns chattering, and sand spraying through the air, or surreptitiously creeping in the dark preparing to ambush the enemy, The Rat Patrol delivers suspense, and by the seat of your pants action, that looks and sounds fantastic on DVD.  Dominic Frontiere's music is simply wonderful, and adds greatly to the enjoyment of the program.  Any kind of bonus material would have been very welcome, but unfortunately there are none.  With a total of 58 episodes, the series is very highly recommended to fans of World War II action.",5,the north african campaign comes to prime time . . .,1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,5282,"['two',
