The woman who plays the mute grandmother and the boy are not actors, but real people, and the performance that the director draws out from them is natural and affecting.The premise and the story is simple: A boy who was raised in an urban, westernized city has to spend a week with his grandmother in the country. The pace that the director generates from this simple premise, and the scenes that he builds the movie with are delightful and funny. And the climax of the movie, which is as gentle and inevitable as life itself, will not fail to draw tears from you.This wonderful and understated film will make you think of the importance of your loved ones, and the world can use more films like this.",4,A Warm-Hearted Gem,1042070400,"01 9, 2003",2003,799,"['need', 'respite', 'frenetic', 'over-acted', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'late', 'watch', 'film', 'woman', 'who', 'mute', 'grandmother', 'boy', 'are', 'not', 'actors', 'real', 'people', 'performance', 'director', 'out', 'natural', 'affecting.The', 'premise', 'story', 'simple', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'urban', 'westernized', 'city', 'spend', 'week', 'grandmother', 'country', 'pace', 'director', 'simple', 'premise', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'delightful', 'funny', 'climax', 'movie', 'gentle', 'inevitable', 'life', 'will', 'not', 'fail', 'draw', 'tears', 'you.This', 'wonderful', 'understated', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'importance', 'loved', 'ones', 'world', 'can', 'use', 'more', 'films']",N/A

But I think that we in the West are used to different cinematic styles, we seem to expect emotional extremes of passion, anger, hate, love, etc. - I think its perhaps because Americans have short attention spans (no insult intended).  But I've noticed in many foreign films, the plot-lines and characters are much more low-key.  Subtlety seems key in watching foreign films.  In this context, &quot;The Way Home&quot; is powerful in its low key way.  Really, this story is about love and transformation.  A grandson goes to the countryside to live with his grandmother.  Initially he is spoiled, vindictive, and in some ways cruel to his mute grandmother.  But in her beautiful way, his grandmother despite being mute, poor and vulnerable is strong and loving.  What wonderful qualities!  She goes to lengths for her grandson, so far that she spends what little money she has to buy a chicken for him even though in the end he is not pleased since it is not KFC style chicken!  Regardless, the film ends with the grandson realizing that he has been given something precious.  While I'm not sure that he ever lost his spoiled ways, he gains a certain respect and love for his grandmother.  Truly, I was moved to tears, despite wanting to smack the little boy over the head at times.

743413,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B00008K76Y,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[5, 9]","This 2002 Korean film is a moving story about a young city boy who is sent for a temporary stay in a remote village.  Seven-year old Song-Woo's single-parent has problems and needs to send Song-Woo to his aging mute grandmother.Song-Woo's mother admits that she has not visited her own mother, so the boy is virtually a stranger to his grandmother.  The boy is selfish, disrespectful, spoiled, and inconsiderate. He calls the old lady crude names without a blink.But we need to consider why is he that way.  Go back to the beginning where he and his mother arrived in the village.  He acts up and his mother hits him several times.  It's clear that his upbringing is reflective to his current behavior.Throughout the movie, we see many troubling instances when he is so inconsiderate and his grandmother is tolerable.  I might disagree that it is unconditional love as some viewers say, it's more that she doesn't know any better.  How many times have women had children, yet when it comes to their grandchildren, they almost forget what to do!  She is simply very compliant and tolerable, and, ok, maybe she loves a grandson she didn't know.There are no striking revelations here.  Finally when he receives a letter from his mother that she is coming to take him, and he somehow manages to reveal just a little tenderness.But I like that this movie showed some realistic humanity in that the boy didn't magically change his behavior.  And what is interesting about his mother is that in the beginning, she seemed cold to her own mother, but by the end, she showed a little more concern and compassion to the lady, like she was truly grateful.One other thing,  I wish the DVD producers would put the ""correct"" picture on the DVD.  This picture did not at all reflect the actual movie.  Not once in the movie did we see a picture like the one on the cover.A more moving picture would be the old bent-over lady walking up the mountain with a cane and the boy.  ......Rizzo",4,A challenging relationship between grandmother and grandson!,1133827200,"12 6, 2005",2005,1970,"['2002', 'Korean', 'film', 'moving', 'story', 'young', 'city', 'boy', 'who', 'sent', 'temporary', 'stay', 'remote', 'village', 'Seven-year', 'old', 'Song-Woo', 'single-parent', 'problems', 'needs', 'send', 'Song-Woo', 'aging', 'mute', 'grandmother.Song-Woo', 'mother', 'not', 'visited', 'own', 'mother', 'boy', 'virtually', 'stranger', 'grandmother', 'boy', 'selfish', 'disrespectful', 'spoiled', 'inconsiderate', 'old', 'lady', 'crude', 'names', 'blink.But', 'need', 'consider', 'why', 'way', 'Go', 'back', 'beginning', 'where', 'mother', 'arrived', 'village', 'up', 'mother', 'several', 'times', 'clear', 'upbringing', 'reflective', 'current', 'movie', 'see', 'many', 'troubling', 'instances', 'when', 'so', 'inconsiderate', 'grandmother', 'tolerable', 'might', 'disagree', 'unconditional', 'love', 'viewers', 'say', 'more', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'women', 'had', 'children', 'yet', 'when', 'grandchildren', 'almost', 'forget', 'what', 'do', 'simply', 'very', 'compliant', 'tolerable', 'ok', 'maybe', 'grandson', 'did', ""n't"", 'know.There', 'are', 'striking', 'revelations', 'here', 'Finally', 'when', 'letter', 'mother', 'coming', 'take', 'somehow', 'reveal', 'just', 'little', 'tenderness.But', 'like', 'movie', 'showed', 'realistic', 'humanity', 'boy', 'did', ""n't"", 'magically', 'change', 'behavior', 'what', 'interesting', 'mother', 'beginning', 'seemed', 'cold', 'own', 'mother', 'end', 'showed', 'little', 'more', 'concern', 'compassion', 'lady', 'was', 'truly', 'grateful.One', 'other', 'thing', 'wish', 'DVD', 'producers', 'would', 'put', 'correct', 'picture', 'DVD', 'picture', 'did', 'not', 'reflect', 'actual', 'movie', 'Not', 'once', 'movie', 'did', 'see', 'picture', 'one', 'cover.A', 'more', 'moving', 'picture', 'would', 'be', 'old', 'bent-over', 'lady', 'walking', 'up', 'mountain', 'cane', 'boy', 'Rizzo']",N/A

Now he learns there is more to life than just superficial electronic games.  He meets other villagers and their children, their crazy animals and their crazy ways.Although I never felt like the kid truly changed from his visit, the love of the woman to the boy was geniune and heart-warming.There was little dialogue in this movie.

His mother is single, doesn't have a job and is almost out of money. She brings Sang-woo to live with her mother for a couple of months while she puts her life back in order and finds a job. Sang-woo finds himself in an utterly different world. His grandmother is 75, bent, ancient, mute, illiterate. She's not simple-minded, but she seems to be infinitely patient. She lives in a ramshakle house on the outskirts of a tiny village way in the hills. Sang-woo refuses to adjust. He wants Kentucky Fried Chicken for supper and electronic games. He feels he's been abandoned and he's not going to give an inch. As time passes, however, he gradually begins to respond to his grandmother's unjudgmental caring.The Way Home is essentially a two person movie. The mother shows up at the start and returns at the end. There are two village children Sang-woo meets. Because the grandmother is mute, there's not much dialogue; most of what there is comes from Sang-woo. The charm of the movie -- and it is a sweet, charming movie -- comes from the relationship which gradually changes between Sang-woo and his grandmother.

The best way to describe and review the film is to recall specific scenes which were memorable and captivating ... The film shows how Sang-woo eventually developed a bond of love and caring attitude toward  his grandmother who had a generous spirit, open heart, great patience and tolerance for her grandson despite his mischevious ways and high energy antics ...He brings along his ""game boy"", books, modular robot, favorite photo cards, and some wooden toys along with his own blanket ... He becomes frustrated with his grandmother who uses sign language in place of vocal language. Her house is on a hillside, built of wood with a corragated metal roof. When she does chores around the house, Sang-woo mocks her behind her back calling her a ""retard"" and other names. When the battery in his game boy dies, and it becomes nonfunctional he walks to the nearest small village but can not find the right batteries. He tries to find his way back but gets lost. A nice elderly Korean man gives him a bicycle ride home  ... He feels lost without modern conveniences, all the gadgets and modern appliances in his life are missing. Even the modest television his grandmother owns does not work right. In place of in-door plumbing and toilet facilities - he is forced to use a chamber pot ...His grandmother tries very hard to please him: she asks him through sign language what he wants to eat. He replies, ""pizza, hamburger, and Kentucky Fried Chicken."" He knows she does not understand. He points out the Kentucky Fried Chicken in a magazine and motions with his arms, making wings, and indicates a rooster's cox comb with his hand. She smiles and understands. She goes out with her vegetables all bundled up and returns with a rooster: a live rooster that she fixes up into a main dish. Yet Sang-woo is not happy and starts crying ... It is boiled meat and he wanted fried Kentucky Chicken. However, in the middle of the night, he ends up eating a drumstick and more ... when driven by hunger.Sang-woo becomes acqainted with two local children close to his age, one is a young girl. He is charmed by her ... His grandmother takes him by bus to the larger village nearby - he sees the young girl and spies on her, trying to win her attention but she ignores him. The grandmother tries to sell her home-grown water-melon and pumpkins at the market. She manages to raise some money and spends most of it on Sang-woo in a restaurant. She looks for the right bus and puts him on it but she ends up walking home. He waits for her at the bus stop but she deos not get off any of them, he later sees her walking around the bend of the road, hunched over using her walking stick for support. Sang-woo eventualy gets a letter from his mother ...His mother writes the visit is over, she will pick him up soon. He shows compassion toward his grandmother, trying to teach her to write: promising her, he will come as soon as she indicates she is sick. He writes out the Korean characters, ""I miss you"" and ""I am sick"". His grandmother tries to imitate the characters but without success. In the end, after he is packed at the bus stop, he finds it hard to say ""good-bye."" His mother makes excuses, saying he is ""shy"" but the bus leaves: he goes to the back and waves good-bye frantically at his grandmother. He sends her his favorite cards with hand-drawn pictures and Korean messages ""I miss you"" and ""Hope you feel well"" ... In the end, both grandmother and grandson felt the same emotions about each other  ... as they learned about each other and how to live together for a short interval of time. This was a very captivating and heart-warming story with a universal message. It will appeal to a wide audience.

743419,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B00008K76Y,Ernest Jagger,"[8, 8]","When I first purchased this South Korean film a few years ago; I put it away thinking it was an alright film, but nothing that special. Strange how our perceptions change with time. If you are into action films, shoot-outs, or thrillers, then this might not be the film for you. Or maybe it is? Once in awhile we need a breather from our normal viewing tastes. And watching this film again tonight made me realize that this really is a good film, and I could not help thinking about the great Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu, whose simple films about Japanese home family life I find to be amongst the best films around.The films narrative deals with a grandmother (Eul-boon Kim) and her extremely obnoxious grandchild, Sang-woo (Seung-ho Yu). Grandmother is a very simple woman, who is content to live a simple life. However, she now has a new person in her life. Sang-woo is only 7-years-old when he goes to visit his grandmother in her rural village, after he is dropped off by his single mother so she can look for work. The love that the grandmother gives to her grandchild is through patience, and a willingness to accept her grandson's bratty behavior through setting an example. What is this example? That she loves him unconditionally, and does not judge him. Wow!This film was directed by Lee Jeong-yang, and she made a very remarkable film. When I viewed it again tonight, I was extremely impressed with the simplicity of the film. The grandmother by the way is not an actress [actually she is a GREAT actress], who had never acted in any film before. Grandmother has weathered time and age toward her twilight years of life. And one can see that she has had a hard and difficult life. And yet, here she is caring for her grandchild. As the grandmother and grandson must live together, the boy begins to understand his grandmother a little bit more, as her kindness changes the grandson.

WHAT A HEART-TUGGER!!!  88 minutes of refreshing, compassionate, heart-warming, sensitive and deftly directed and acted film!!!  What a rarity nowadays!""The Way Home"" is a positively universal look at the effect of Grandmothers upon younger generations.  Set in modern-day Korea, seven year old Sang-woo,  is ""pawned off"" by his unable-to-keep-up-with-him-and life Mother on the 75-year old Grandmother, who is deaf and mute. Grandmother lives in the ""old way"", in a rural mountainous village where time is of no consequence.  Sang-woo is a Western- influenced child, in love with Game Boy and Kentucky Fried Chicken, and this abandonment to his ""retard"" Grandmother (as he so callously refers to her!) is positively unbearable.  Grandmother's first communication with Sang-woo is the rubbing of the heart-""I love you"", but Sang-woo will have none of this!  He daily throws tantrums and finds himself bored, scared, and wholeheartedly a true seven year old confused and lonely.  There is so little dialogue needed in this film, as the two learn about each other; but we are well assured that Grandmother is wise and loving beyond all wisdom; we are also aware that Sang-woo is as bratty as they come, having no Father, and deserted by his Mother, and a child who will ""act out"" in fear and frustration.  There are moments when it appears that Sang-woo will have a breakthrough, but they are slow in coming.  Understanding, wisdom, patience and giving are not natural to Sang-woo;  only Grandmother will be able to teach him those lessons through example.This film won so many prizes internationally, and it is easy to see why; writer/director Jeong-Hyang Lee has a passion and a sensitivity for her subject and it is communicated tenderly, lovingly and with great compassion and sagacity.  She has chosen common folk, not stars, to win over the audience.  There is no affectation of Hollywood stars here; but instead real, everyday people who are captured on screen in a way that puts ""the stars"" to shame!!!The soundtrack is playful woodwind quintet music and piano with strings that is interspersed with great effect to communicate the childlike view and the Grandmotherly view.  Excellently crafted!  An extremely well-thought-through film.  Every shot counts and is beautifully edited and formed into a loving, yet not overly so, tribute to the older generation.The postscript states:  ""Dedicated to ALL Grandmothers"" as the final credits roll!

He is the typical bratty child. But after he is sent to live with his grandmother in the Korean countryside while his mother looks for employment in Seoul, Sang Woo gradually transforms his attitude towards others and starts to appreciate those around him more. He progressively begins to appreciate the actions of both his mute grandmother and the neighbor children. At the end of his stay his separation from his grandmother is painful and heart breaking for both of them. They have created a bond across generations that is filled with love and understanding.THE WAY HOME is a beautiful film that is difficult to forget. I certainly felt lonely for my own deceased grandmother while watching this film. The ending tribute dedicated to all grandmothers was a nice touch.

743438,ABUEUI62QAK7F,B00008K76Y,vanhubris,"[6, 7]","This is another great Korean movie.  In brief--Sang-Woo is left by his mother at his grandmothers while she looks for a job. Pretty much a spoiled brat his adjustment to the barren lifestyle of his grandmother and her neighbors is difficult to say the least.  Somehow, Grandma puts up with the little monster--even when he steals her hairpin to hopefully exchange for batteries for his hand held electronic game--she simply replaces it with a spoon.  From his tantrums about the lack of Kentucky fried chicken or the haircut grandma gives him--to his mean jokes about a mad bull--Sang-woo is a pretty bad kid--but in time he learns to appreciate the simple life--perhaps not wholeheartedly, but at least to the point where he realizes he'll miss grandma--even making her promise to send him a blank sheet of paper if she gets sick--so that he'll know--since she can neither speak nor write  The performance of Eul-Boon Kim as the deaf grandma is outstanding--but easy to overlook is the great performance by Seung-Ho as Sang-Woo.  Supposedly, seven years old--I wouild guess that's about his real age--and he plays his part to perfection!I doubt you can find this movie to rent at your local video store--but it's worth buying anyway--so order a copy.  If you like movies like ""Trip to Bountiful"", ""Rhapsody in August"", ""Failan"" or ""Strangers in Good Company""--you should really enjoy this movie too!I have to admit this movie reminded me of my own grandmother who passed away 33 years ago--especially the boiled chicken--what ""fond"" memories!",5,The Taming of the Brat,1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,1543,"['great', 'Korean', 'movie', 'brief', 'Sang-Woo', 'left', 'mother', 'grandmothers', 'job', 'Pretty', 'much', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'adjustment', 'barren', 'lifestyle', 'grandmother', 'neighbors', 'difficult', 'say', 'least', 'Somehow', 'Grandma', 'up', 'little', 'monster', 'even', 'when', 'hairpin', 'hopefully', 'exchange', 'batteries', 'hand', 'held', 'electronic', 'game', 'simply', 'spoon', 'tantrums', 'lack', 'Kentucky', 'fried', 'chicken', 'haircut', 'grandma', 'mean', 'jokes', 'mad', 'bull', 'Sang-woo', 'pretty', 'bad', 'kid', 'time', 'appreciate', 'simple', 'life', 'perhaps', 'not', 'wholeheartedly', 'least', 'point', 'where', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'grandma', 'even', 'making', 'promise', 'send', 'blank', 'sheet', 'paper', 'sick', 'so', ""'ll"", 'know', 'can', 'neither', 'speak', 'write', 'performance', 'Eul-Boon', 'Kim', 'deaf', 'grandma', 'outstanding', 'easy', 'overlook', 'great', 'performance', 'Seung-Ho', 'Sang-Woo', 'Supposedly', 'seven', 'years', 'old', 'wouild', 'guess', 'real', 'age', 'part', 'perfection', 'doubt', 'can', 'find', 'movie', 'rent', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'worth', 'buying', 'anyway', 'so', 'order', 'copy', 'like', 'movies', 'Trip', 'Bountiful', 'Rhapsody', 'August', 'Failan', 'Strangers', 'Good', 'Company', 'should', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'too', 'have', 'admit', 'movie', 'reminded', 'own', 'grandmother', 'who', 'passed', 'away', '33', 'years', 'ago', 'especially', 'boiled', 'chicken', 'what', 'fond', 'memories']",N/A
