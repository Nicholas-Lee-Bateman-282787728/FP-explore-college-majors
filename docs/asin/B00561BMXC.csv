There is much dialogue showing the dangers of the christian faith and the dangers of dying for your beliefs. The poor ending certainly damaged the film greatly when it was not necessary.

1443754,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00561BMXC,B. E Jackson,"[0, 5]","The Ledge is a pretty disappointing movie.  The previews lead one to believe that this is a must see, action-filled suspense, but... the suspense isn't actually *there* most of the time.  Oh sure, when you see a guy standing on a rooftop and threatening to jump, your instict is to think ""I bet this movie's going to be edge of your seat nonstop excitement!"" but... it's not.  At least not my version of what makes a movie suspenseful.You're probably also wondering WHY the guy is considering taking his own life.  There must be a bunch of different possibilities.  Maybe he's a wanted murderer?  Maybe he's part of a terrorist group and he turned against them, so now they're threatening to kill him?  Maybe he just had one of those days where he woke up on the wrong side of the bed and he's sick and tired of everything?  Nah, it's nothing like that.  What the reason is actually makes for a *very* slow-moving, uninteresting, and mediocre film overall.The *exact* reason the man is threatening to jump from a building won't be spoiled, so I'll just mention what the storyline is about.It's about a religious man and an atheist getting into constant arguments over who's right.  Now I admit, some of these arguments provide some insightful questions.  For example, the scene where the religious man explains what he had to say to a little girl who was dying on a hospital bed.  Unfortunately -like always- the atheist is portrayed as an arrogant know-it-all, and this really doesn't come as a shock to me.  In reality atheists aren't really anything like that (most of the time at least) but good luck telling Hollywood this.  However, at least in this particular case, this aspect DOES actually change and improve- eventually the atheist (the guy on top of the building played by Charlie Hunnam) actually has a sympathetic side, and a tragic life story to go along with it.Basically Charlie's character strongly desires the woman portraying Liv Tyler but... she's unfortunately married to a psychotic man who takes his religious beliefs a bit too seriously.  He shares old-fashioned beliefs and believes that... well, nevermind.  I don't want to go against the promise I made above and spoil it.  I admit the final 15 minutes are pretty shocking and I didn't see the ending coming.The bottom line is this- yes, it's compelling when a man threatens to jump from way up high, but this movie bases the ENTIRE storyline around this aspect, which means when Terrence Howard's character tries to communicate and rationalize with the man, instead we're treated to a storyline explaining how and why the man got to the point of suicide.In other words, Hunnam's character is up there on the building telling his story for the entirety of the movie.  The story goes back and forth between the communication process of Howard and Hunnam's character and Hunnam's relationship with Liv Tyler for the entire movie, and... the reason it's a 3-star movie is because very little of this story contains compelling drama or suspense.The movie's selling point is that a man wants to kill himself, but once we find out why -for me at least- it's a major disappointment.  That's the bottom line for me.  Maybe you'll like it, but for me?  Nah, it's severely lacking.

This movie, which is sometimes screened at atheist support groups, is poorly done.For starters, it sets up a straw man combat between a nutcase, hyper-controlling sexually inept fundamentalist who gives one the willies the first time you lay eyes on him, and a virile, witty, compassionate, tolerant atheist that can do no wrong.Here's the deal:  with friends like the producers of this movie, who (as an atheist) needs enemies?  In real life, though I'm firmly convinced that religion is a net negative, I meet intelligent, humorous, compassionate, world-improving believers on a daily basis.  As a non-believer who regularly meets other atheist/non-believer types that have all of the above qualities, too.  A more fascinating story would be to use examples from real life (e.g. approx. 90% of Nobel Prize winners in science) that demonstrate that worth and faith are definitely not joined at the hip.  Atheists aren't all hipsters that can seduce Liv Tyler (gazing on her was probably the best part of the movie) with a glance or two.  Christians aren't all deranged.

1443758,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B00561BMXC,Elisabeth,"[2, 11]","**This review contains spoilers**I was drawn to this movie thinking it'd be about a desperate man on a ledge having an existential crisis, questioning religion and the meaning of life.  In a flashback, we have a Theist and an Atheist discussing why they each believe what they do.  The Atheist's argument had a bite to it, but the Theist's rebuttals were presented in a calm way.  I thought, finally, a movie that can rationally discuss faith differences without resorting to tired stereotypes.I was wrong.I should've guessed wrong by the early homophobia of the Theist, but I was hoping to be surprised.  When the Theist starts acting more and more extreme as the movie wears on, I knew this movie would be serving an Atheist agenda.  Instead of presenting both sides fairly and having you think for yourself, you'll be told what to think.  This is true with the two other stories as well.  There are a lot of ""shoulds"" in this movie.In one story, you have a wife who betrays her husband's trust, but in her mind, she was doing him a favor.  Never mind that he never asked her to mislead him...or wanted her to mislead him...or that misleading him caused him to seriously mistrust her...or that misleading him insults his maturity by assuming he couldn't handle the truth.  Forget all that, if this woman viewed it as doing him a favor, you should, too.  You should see this man as overreacting and unappreciative and you should root for him to take back his wife.In the other story, you have a wife who feels oppressed by her husband.  Instead of rooting for her to stand up to her husband or leave him if that proves futile, you should root for her to commit adultery.In one scene, the lover's roommate walks in on the adulterers in bed and the lover reassures the wife by saying, ""Don't worry, he's cool"".  Right, because cool people understand the necessity of adultery, so they won't rat you out.  Cool people understand that adultery is necessary for a woman to liberate herself...whereas uncool people see it as a contradiction to call yourself liberated if you're also sneaking around and pretending to be someone you're not in front of your spouse.You should also view this woman as kind, too.  After all, she did express how grateful she was that her husband saved her and concern that if she ever left him, he might kill himself.  However, if she was so grateful, why didn't she respect him enough to not play him the way she did?  If she was so concerned he might kill himself, then why commit the one act that, if caught, might cause a guy like that to kill himself?I just wasn't buying the message this movie was selling.  The only thing that made this movie somewhat bearable to watch is that actor Charlie Hunnam is very easy on the eyes.  However, I fast forwarded through his sex scenes...not because I don't appreciate a hot sex scene with a hot actor...but because I don't find adulterous sex scenes to be hot.  I guess I'm just not cool enough.",1,Full of Should,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,2966,"['**This', 'review', 'contains', 'spoilers**I', 'was', 'drawn', 'movie', 'thinking', ""'d"", 'be', 'desperate', 'man', 'ledge', 'having', 'existential', 'crisis', 'questioning', 'religion', 'meaning', 'life', 'flashback', 'have', 'Theist', 'Atheist', 'discussing', 'why', 'believe', 'what', 'do', 'Atheist', 'argument', 'had', 'bite', 'Theist', 'rebuttals', 'were', 'presented', 'calm', 'way', 'thought', 'finally', 'movie', 'can', 'rationally', 'discuss', 'faith', 'differences', 'resorting', 'tired', 'stereotypes.I', 'was', 'wrong.I', 'should', ""'ve"", 'guessed', 'wrong', 'early', 'homophobia', 'Theist', 'was', 'hoping', 'be', 'surprised', 'When', 'Theist', 'acting', 'more', 'more', 'extreme', 'movie', 'knew', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'serving', 'Atheist', 'agenda', 'Instead', 'presenting', 'sides', 'fairly', 'having', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'told', 'what', 'think', 'true', 'two', 'other', 'stories', 'well', 'are', 'lot', 'shoulds', 'movie.In', 'one', 'story', 'have', 'wife', 'who', 'husband', 'trust', 'mind', 'was', 'doing', 'favor', 'mind', 'never', 'asked', 'mislead', 'wanted', 'mislead', 'misleading', 'caused', 'seriously', 'mistrust', 'misleading', 'insults', 'maturity', 'assuming', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'truth', 'Forget', 'woman', 'viewed', 'doing', 'favor', 'should', 'too', 'should', 'see', 'man', 'overreacting', 'unappreciative', 'should', 'root', 'take', 'back', 'wife.In', 'other', 'story', 'have', 'wife', 'who', 'oppressed', 'husband', 'Instead', 'rooting', 'stand', 'up', 'husband', 'leave', 'futile', 'should', 'root', 'commit', 'adultery.In', 'one', 'scene', 'lover', 'roommate', 'walks', 'adulterers', 'bed', 'lover', 'wife', 'saying', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'cool', 'Right', 'cool', 'people', 'understand', 'necessity', 'adultery', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rat', 'out', 'Cool', 'people', 'understand', 'adultery', 'necessary', 'woman', 'liberate', 'whereas', 'uncool', 'people', 'see', 'contradiction', 'call', 'liberated', ""'re"", 'also', 'sneaking', 'around', 'pretending', 'be', 'someone', ""'re"", 'not', 'front', 'spouse.You', 'should', 'also', 'view', 'woman', 'kind', 'too', 'did', 'express', 'how', 'grateful', 'was', 'husband', 'saved', 'concern', 'ever', 'left', 'might', 'kill', 'However', 'was', 'so', 'grateful', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'respect', 'enough', 'not', 'play', 'way', 'did', 'was', 'so', 'concerned', 'might', 'kill', 'then', 'why', 'commit', 'one', 'act', 'caught', 'might', 'cause', 'guy', 'kill', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'buying', 'message', 'movie', 'was', 'selling', 'only', 'thing', 'made', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'bearable', 'watch', 'actor', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'very', 'easy', 'eyes', 'However', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'sex', 'scenes', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'hot', 'sex', 'scene', 'hot', 'actor', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'adulterous', 'sex', 'scenes', 'be', 'hot', 'guess', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'cool', 'enough']",The Ledge
1443759,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00561BMXC,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 2]","There have been some number of ""issue"" movies over the years. This is better than average, but just a bit.Here's the scoop. Gavin (Charlie Hunnam) is a likable, easy going hotel manager. He gets new neighbors in his building, Shana and Joe Harris (Liv Tyler and Patrick Wilson). It's realized right off the bat that Gavin and Joe are on opposite sides of the ""God"" issue, and as Gavin finds himself uncontrollably drawn to Shana the issue is brought to its extreme with Gavin finding himself on a tall ledge poised to jump.I like this kind of movie because I'm drawn to these kinds of arguments. Writer/Director Matthew Chapman is clearly siding with Gavin, but shows good reason why Joe and Shana are so strongly religious. The four principal characters, Gavin, Joe, Shana and detective Hollis Lucetti (Terrence Howard) who is trying to talk Gavin off the ledge, all have or had life altering problems in their lives. They merely chose different ways to re-emerge into the world. So the viewer does not want to slot them as me good you bad black and white. But finally how far will you go to defend your belief? Where is the line that you will not cross?This is a good watch. Hunnam has a certain presence in front of the camera but he's got a rather narrow range as an actor. His role needed someone with much more gravity. I liked Wilson and Tyler a lot. I thought they handled their roles well. I find Howard not much better than Hunnam. I'm glad they switched him out for Don Cheadle in the ""Iron Man"" movies. But this all moves at a steady pace and you really want to know how Gavin will handle his deadline. I found the progression from the opening scene, where Gavin climbs out on the ledge, to the backtracking of how he came to be there, very satisfying. They did need more time with him and Howard squaring off, but that's a rather minor quibble.There were a fair number of small things that would have made this a better film but it's pretty good as it is.",3,Where's Your Line?,1373846400,"07 15, 2013",2013,1968,"['have', 'been', 'number', 'issue', 'movies', 'years', 'better', 'average', 'just', 'bit.Here', 'scoop', 'Gavin', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'likable', 'easy', 'going', 'hotel', 'manager', 'new', 'neighbors', 'building', 'Shana', 'Joe', 'Harris', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'realized', 'right', 'bat', 'Gavin', 'Joe', 'are', 'opposite', 'sides', 'God', 'issue', 'Gavin', 'uncontrollably', 'drawn', 'Shana', 'issue', 'brought', 'extreme', 'Gavin', 'finding', 'tall', 'ledge', 'poised', 'jump.I', 'kind', 'movie', ""'m"", 'drawn', 'kinds', 'arguments', 'Writer/Director', 'Matthew', 'Chapman', 'clearly', 'siding', 'Gavin', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'Joe', 'Shana', 'are', 'so', 'strongly', 'religious', 'four', 'principal', 'characters', 'Gavin', 'Joe', 'Shana', 'detective', 'Hollis', 'Lucetti', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'who', 'trying', 'talk', 'Gavin', 'ledge', 'have', 'had', 'life', 'altering', 'problems', 'lives', 'merely', 'chose', 'different', 'ways', 're-emerge', 'world', 'viewer', 'not', 'want', 'slot', 'good', 'bad', 'black', 'white', 'finally', 'how', 'far', 'will', 'go', 'defend', 'belief', 'Where', 'line', 'will', 'not', 'cross', 'good', 'watch', 'Hunnam', 'certain', 'presence', 'front', 'camera', 'got', 'rather', 'narrow', 'range', 'actor', 'role', 'needed', 'someone', 'much', 'more', 'gravity', 'liked', 'Wilson', 'Tyler', 'lot', 'thought', 'handled', 'roles', 'well', 'find', 'Howard', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'Hunnam', ""'m"", 'glad', 'switched', 'out', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movies', 'moves', 'steady', 'pace', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'Gavin', 'will', 'handle', 'deadline', 'found', 'progression', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'Gavin', 'out', 'ledge', 'backtracking', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'there', 'very', 'satisfying', 'did', 'need', 'more', 'time', 'Howard', 'squaring', 'off', 'rather', 'minor', 'quibble.There', 'were', 'fair', 'number', 'small', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'film', 'pretty', 'good']",The Ledge

1443761,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00561BMXC,Grady Harp,"[10, 16]","Matthew Chapman both wrote and directed this film that relates a fine little suspense thriller along with an ongoing debate between atheism and fundamental evangelical Christianity.  As back ground it is of interest to note that Chapman has written two books - 'Trials Of The Monkey - An Accidental Memoir', an account of the Scopes Trial told in the form of a road trip Chapman took to the town where the trial took place, along with a memoir of his childhood growing up as a descendant of Charles Darwin, and '40 Days and 40 Nights - Darwin, Intelligent Design, God, OxyContin, and Other Oddities On Trial in Pennsylvania', that tells the story of a small town ripped apart when fundamentalism and science came in conflict. It is obvious that Chapman is concerned about the dichotomy of faith and belief in God and the polar opposite, atheism: this theme is an important part of the impact of the story of THE LEDGE - a title that not only explains the place where the tale takes place but likely also explains the stance of Chapman in the process of deciding his own belief system.The film begins with a young man Gavin running up to the top floor of a building to stand on a ledge in order to commit suicide.  A policeman is assigned to talk him down: the story is told in flashbacks. Gavin Nichols (Charlie Hunnam) is a likable guy who is in hotel management. Quite by accident he encounters a beautiful but shy Shana (Liv Tyler) on the bus only to discover that Shana is applying for work at this hotel as a housekeeper to make extra money to afford school. There is an attraction but Shana quickly lets Gavin know that she is married: her husband Joe (Patrick Wilson) is a evangelical fundamentalist who orders his and Shana's life according to Bible teachings. By chance Shana and Joe live in the same apartment building and the same corridor as Gavin: Gavin's roommate Chris (Christopher Gorham) is gay and is HIV positive and Gavin has taken him in when his family and friends deserted Chris.  Joe and Shana invite Gavin and Chris to dinner where it becomes painfully obvious that Joe, thinking that both men are gay, finds their lifestyle abominably sinful. There is a fiery discussion about Gavin's disbelief in the things Joe believes in. Gavin leaves in disgust but the gentle Chris stays a bit longer until he discovers that Joe wants to convert him so that he can change his life and avoid damnation.Gavin and Shana have an affair, Joe learns about it, and threatens Gavin that by noon either he will kill Shana or Gavin can jump to his suicide death. We gradually discover Shana's dark background which explains why she stays with Joe and Gavin's equally tortured background which explains why he has lost all semblance of faith and only sees the need to care for his fellowman. And we learn that detective Hollis (Terrance Howard) assigned to talk Gavin down from the ledge has his own personal failure to have faith due to newly discovered challenges to his concept of his home life.  It is this struggle among the five characters and the way that destiny has thrown them together that brings a very surprising end to this film.There is a lot to digest in this tense drama.  At times the role of fundamental religion threatens to over take the film (Patrick Wilson plays his role of a reformed sinner to the hilt), but due to the cautious writing of the script combined with the spot on acting skills of each of the five leads the audience is left to draw their own conclusions about the atheism/ fundamentalism debate.

1443762,A3QSM5XHPL1T6Y,B00561BMXC,"Greg ""Saganite""","[3, 7]","Here's what I don't understand: This was an extremely contrived story. So if you're going to stack the deck anyway, why stack it so it comes up with a pair of tens? I mean, if you're going to stack it, stack it for crying out loud. I actually think he (meaning director Matthew Chapman) wrote the Christian characters as more interesting and sympathetic than he did the lone atheist one.Oh, and why not let the atheist character have some interesting atheist friends? And why imply that his atheism is at least largely dependent on a personal tragedy that befell him (rather than, say, a process of intellectual doubt)? Maybe Chapman was trying to bring in more authenticity by having the point of view he was espousing be so flawed, but since he was actively promoting--OBVIOUSLY actively promoting--atheism anyway, why not at least make the character less of a douche?And the writing and acting were both mediocre. Not horrible. Just bad enough that the combined mediocrity was enough to make me wince. If either the writing had been so sparkling as to have been all but bad-actor-proof, or the acting rose above the material, it might have been almost good. As it is, just one more embarrassment for my people.But OK...it probably is not actually any worse thanFireproofor ""Courageous."" I just expect more from atheists than I do from Christians. We supposedly have all these brilliant, dead clever ""free thinkers,"" and then this is the best we can come up with?No wonder most Americans care no more for ultimate questions than they do, with the issue's best representatives on either side talking past each other or engaged in making dreadful, amateur propaganda rather than lasting art.And from the whiskey-tango-foxtrot files: The bonus features contain interviews with Chapman and the actors, but they are held in noisy hallways and outside on tops of buildings with loud construction work and traffic sounds in the background.  Supremely distracting.  And at several points Chapman says, ""Let's start again,"" but nothing is edited out.  On one hand, this is admirable--maybe he's trying to show a little of that ""warts-and-all"" integrity of the scientific method embodied by his great-grandfather, Charles Darwin.  But on the other hand, the impact on the viewer is of further amateurism, as if the features were part of some high school project.I give it three stars for one reason: ""The Ledge"" at least has the boldness of vision to demonstrate that interesting philosophical issues can be presented in a compelling format, using a fictional narrative.  G.K. Chesterton did this very well for his worldview, Roman Catholicism, in stories such asThe Man Who Was Thursday: Centennial Edition.  While I think that there are several top-drawer atheist artists and storytellers (Joss Whedon and Philip Pullman come to mind), we have a ways to go before we master the art of cogent storytelling, intent on making a point by bringing characters and situations and ideas to life.Having pounded on with almost relentless criticism, there are moments that gesture toward the movie that might have been, and it would have been gripping.  I hope that Chapman, having returned to filmmaking after a hiatus, will continue to attempt what has not yet been accomplished: making a case for not just the rationality of atheism, but the profoundly positive experience of it.",3,Stack the deck better if you're making propaganda.,1317686400,"10 4, 2011",2011,3365,"['Here', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'was', 'extremely', 'contrived', 'story', 'So', ""'re"", 'going', 'stack', 'deck', 'anyway', 'why', 'stack', 'up', 'pair', 'tens', 'mean', ""'re"", 'going', 'stack', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'actually', 'think', 'meaning', 'director', 'Matthew', 'Chapman', 'wrote', 'Christian', 'characters', 'more', 'interesting', 'sympathetic', 'did', 'lone', 'atheist', 'one.Oh', 'why', 'not', 'let', 'atheist', 'character', 'have', 'interesting', 'atheist', 'friends', 'why', 'imply', 'atheism', 'least', 'largely', 'dependent', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'befell', 'rather', 'say', 'process', 'intellectual', 'doubt', 'Maybe', 'Chapman', 'was', 'trying', 'bring', 'more', 'authenticity', 'having', 'point', 'view', 'was', 'espousing', 'be', 'so', 'flawed', 'was', 'actively', 'promoting', 'OBVIOUSLY', 'actively', 'promoting', 'atheism', 'anyway', 'why', 'not', 'least', 'make', 'character', 'less', 'douche', 'writing', 'acting', 'were', 'mediocre', 'Not', 'horrible', 'Just', 'bad', 'enough', 'combined', 'mediocrity', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'wince', 'writing', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'sparkling', 'have', 'been', 'bad-actor-proof', 'acting', 'rose', 'material', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'almost', 'good', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'embarrassment', 'people.But', 'OK', 'probably', 'not', 'actually', 'worse', 'thanFireproofor', 'Courageous', 'just', 'expect', 'more', 'atheists', 'do', 'Christians', 'supposedly', 'have', 'brilliant', 'dead', 'clever', 'free', 'thinkers', 'then', 'best', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'wonder', 'most', 'Americans', 'care', 'more', 'ultimate', 'questions', 'do', 'issue', 'best', 'representatives', 'side', 'talking', 'other', 'engaged', 'making', 'dreadful', 'amateur', 'propaganda', 'rather', 'lasting', 'art.And', 'whiskey-tango-foxtrot', 'files', 'bonus', 'contain', 'interviews', 'Chapman', 'actors', 'are', 'held', 'noisy', 'hallways', 'outside', 'tops', 'buildings', 'loud', 'construction', 'work', 'traffic', 'sounds', 'background', 'Supremely', 'distracting', 'several', 'points', 'Chapman', 'Let', 'start', 'again', 'nothing', 'edited', 'out', 'one', 'hand', 'admirable', 'maybe', 'trying', 'show', 'little', 'warts-and-all', 'integrity', 'scientific', 'method', 'embodied', 'great-grandfather', 'Charles', 'Darwin', 'other', 'hand', 'impact', 'viewer', 'further', 'amateurism', 'features', 'were', 'part', 'high', 'school', 'project.I', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'one', 'reason', 'Ledge', 'least', 'boldness', 'vision', 'demonstrate', 'interesting', 'philosophical', 'issues', 'can', 'be', 'presented', 'compelling', 'format', 'using', 'fictional', 'narrative', 'G.K.', 'Chesterton', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'worldview', 'Roman', 'Catholicism', 'stories', 'such', 'asThe', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', 'Thursday', 'Centennial', 'Edition', 'think', 'are', 'several', 'top-drawer', 'atheist', 'artists', 'storytellers', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Philip', 'Pullman', 'come', 'mind', 'have', 'ways', 'go', 'master', 'art', 'cogent', 'storytelling', 'intent', 'making', 'point', 'bringing', 'characters', 'situations', 'ideas', 'life.Having', 'pounded', 'almost', 'relentless', 'criticism', 'are', 'moments', 'gesture', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'gripping', 'hope', 'Chapman', 'having', 'returned', 'filmmaking', 'hiatus', 'will', 'continue', 'attempt', 'what', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'accomplished', 'making', 'case', 'not', 'just', 'rationality', 'atheism', 'profoundly', 'positive', 'experience']",The Ledge

1443767,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00561BMXC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","Writer/director Matthew Chapman had a terrific idea for a complex movie dealing with faith and sacrifice set in a neo-noir framework. I absolutely love the idea of ""The Ledge"" and its intriguing premise earns it some merit. But if I'm being honest, the themes that Chapman wants to introduce and wrestle with are largely undermined by a screenplay that presents some of the most awkward dialogue and contrived settings that you're likely to encounter in a serious picture with this much talent involved. Patrick Wilson, Liv Tyler, Terrence Howard and Charlie Hunnam are all actors that I have connected with in the past. It's easy to see the attraction that this type of movie would have held for them. But aside from one great scene near the end for Wilson, the rest of the cast flounders with the clunky script and overwrought ideology. The film bludgeons you with its many debates on religious notions by forcing characters together that would never expend so much effort in the real world attempting to communicate. Sadly, it's a near fatal flaw.The plot of ""The Ledge"" is exceedingly strong. Hunnam starts the movie by climbing out onto a ledge (no big surprise considering the title) with the intent to jump. Howard, as a cop having a bad day, is on the scene to talk him down--but instead is the recipient of a story of why the potential suicide may be more than it seems. Hunnam relates a tale that involves adultery and religious debate with his new neighbors (Wilson and Tyler). Both have had a challenging past, but they've settled into a life as fundamentalist Christians. Their friendship with the atheist Hunnam is an opportunity for basic debate. And while it's always nice to have a movie that is unafraid to tackle religious themes overtly, there is a clumsiness to these scenes that can be difficult to handle. Neither party is particularly likable, have nothing in common, would never develop a relationship more than to say ""hi"" in the hallway--but the movie consistently puts them together for meaningful dialogue. There is nothing natural about the flow of the film.I'm not going to discuss more of the plot so as not to give anything away--but it is these central conflicts that eventually drive Hunnam to the aforementioned ledge. The film could easily have been turned into a nifty little thriller with more realistic character development. Hunnam's character is blatantly unprofessional and inappropriate at work. A good actor, here he is stranded in a thoroughly unappealing and unbelievable character. Seriously, his seduction scenes with Tyler made me alternately laugh and cringe with some of the silliest dialogue I've encountered this year. Tyler, for her part, plays one emotion. It's hard to see what is supposed to be so alluring about this expressionless character. Howard is undeveloped. His plot thread is conveniently tacked on to heighten the drama and for him to be the recipient of the piece's deep philosophical lessons. Wilson, one of our most underrated actors, is turned into a zealot--but has one scene that sticks out in a refreshingly riveting way.It was, ultimately, the characters that left me cold as well as the heavy handed message. For example, Christopher Gorham is on hand as Hunnam's homosexual Jewish roommate. Why? As a plot device, of course, so Wilson can scorn homosexuals and Hunnam can challenge religion (he can quote from the Talmud, naturally). At one point, Gorham is bathing the apartment in blessed Temple water. Really? It's overdone and obvious. With a bit of subtlety, Chapman might have scored a real triumph. I loved the idea, I like the actors--but (for me) little about the movie worked. Good ambition, but lacking in the execution.

I was, however, offended by how fake the dialogue was, how heavy-handed it was in presenting its message, and how completely obvious and ham-fisted the whole thing was. The writer clearly had a one-tracked mind and didn't realize that he was penning the equivalent of beating someone over the head with a chair.  Honestly, I saw a few Christian movies growing up and this one would fall right in line with them in terms of the sheer level of self-righteous posturing, shallowness, and preachiness.The worst part is that the movie's structure and pacing are also poorly executed so that the narrative becomes a choppy mess.  My guess is that someone decided to put the guy on the ledge in the first few minutes in the hopes that it would keep audiences interested long enough to endure the torture that the rest of the movie is.

This movie shows the truth of where true morals come from and it is not from religions.

Then we codified the morals into the first law that governed, controlled, influenced, and regulated a person's actions as well as systems to conduct the policy and affairs of a village, a state, or others organizations. Only tens of thousands of years  later did the religions incorporated some of these morals into their dogma. I know I went a long way to make my point but here it is: as this movie shows morals are only real when they come from within the person and not from the fear of being tortured for all of eternity if you don't follow a ""gods commands"".It is not often that a movie show the truth of morals and who really have them.

This is one of those limited-release, independent films that people like me never hear about unless someone tells us or we read about it somewhere.  I heard it mentioned on the ""Point of Inquiry"" podcast, which usually features fairly intelligent and rigorous commentators.  And the director being Charles Darwin's great-grandson was an interesting bit of trivia.As others have pointed out, the script was clunky and most of the actors were either monotone, or unconvincingly emotional.  The religious discussions were about at the level one would find at a junior high school lunch table.  The film was hyped as significant because of the atheist leading character, but it was implied that he had lost his faith because of his daughter's senseless death.  Even as an atheist myself, I have scant respect for people who become atheists after some personal tragedy - as if the tragedies of others are unimportant, but as soon as something happens to them personally, suddenly they are ready to abandon their faith.  The Christian character doesn't come off any better here, either; the existence of pain and evil in a world supposedly created by a benevolent diety has been addressed by many religious writers through the ages.  There was no shortage of reasonable responses that the character could have given, but instead we get nothing, as if no one had ever noticed this before or found it to be a problem.One trend I despise is the use of the violent and insane white Christian fanatic.  A character of this type was the villain in the 6th season of ""Dexter,"" and I am afraid that it is going to be a stock bad guy for a while.  Yes, I know about Charles Manson and Tim McVeigh and Anders Breivik.  But you can find those extremes within any group.  The husband is presented not as a killer who happens to be a Christian white guy; he is a killer because he is a Christian white guy.  I find this presentation offensive, and can hardly wait until people tire of it and move onto some other target.  It's just as bad as ""Jew Suss.""  Despite the Dominionist-inspired rhetoric of Rick Santorum, Michele Bachmann, and their ilk, and even the laughable hate-mongering of Fred Phelps, there are no Christian armies anywhere in the world, much less in the U.S., attempting to establish a Biblical Theocracy.Nevertheless, I can see the film's appeal to those who are interested in philosophical issues, but want it spoon-fed in easy doses.

Especially Charlie Hunnam and Terrence Howard.  I know of Charlie because I have so many women friends who are just crazy about him because of his part in Sons of Anarchy.  His acting in this movie makes me want to check that series out.  He was so easy as Gavin.  It was as though he understood his character inside and out.  You saw a man who started off playing a game, and ended up getting captured by it as the song goes.  I know Terrence Howard from many movies.  He can be quite controversial at times from his private life reports, but I would never say that this man is not a superb actor.  He acts as easily as the stride with which he walks.Patrick Wilson as the born again zealot was amazing.  my heart broke for him when he stood outside Gavin's door and heard his wife in the throes of ecstasy because of another man.  And when he talked about his past life and his love for Shana you believed him and understood who he was as well.This is a very good movie, well acted and thought provoking.

1443790,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B00561BMXC,William Timothy Lukeman,"[3, 5]","A police detective who has just received shattering personal news is dispatched to talk a potential jumper off a ledge, only to discover that he has to jump or else someone he loves will die. Add to that immediately gripping opening scene some superb acting from all involved, as well as a strong & thought-provoking screenplay, and you've got a film well worth watching, and then discussing at length afterwards.So why do some reviews call it too contrived & thus unwatchable?I suggest that the current obsession with so-called ""realism"" in contemporary entertainment is to blame. Yes, the story is a bit stagey ... but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Ironically, for a film about atheism & fundamentalism at odds, it's very much like a Medieval mystery play, in which characters represent certain specific worldviews or aspects of human existence. In short, it's as much allegory as straight narrative. This was once an acceptable form of storytelling, as can be seen in quite a few films & TV shows from the 1950s & 1960s. Now, however, the emphasis on a rather generic & homogenized ""realism"" -- which is in fact just as contrived & artificial as any other form of storytelling in the end -- makes it difficult for some viewers to enter into the story & its ideas.Don't let that deter you from seeing it, though. Unlike so many formulaic & empty film spectacles these days, ""The Ledge"" offers an intense story with well-rounded characters, as well as plenty of ideas to grapple with: ideas about faith, about belief, about love, about self-sacrifice, about the meaning of life (or whether there is any such meaning at all). Again, the characters are in part allegorical ones ... but they're also recognizable individuals, with painful & complex backstories that make us sympathize with them, even if we don't share their particular worldviews.So, the film's approach might put off some viewers who aren't comfortable with its style of storytelling. But if you can give yourself over to it, you'll find yourself fascinated by the lives of its characters & the terrible choices they must make ... and you'll most likely wind up thinking about your own beliefs & the choices you make everyday, as well. That's rare to find in film today, which is what makes this one so refreshing & striking -- highly recommended!",4,An insightful & thought-provoking contemporary mystery play - 4 & 1/2 stars,1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,2319,"['police', 'detective', 'who', 'just', 'received', 'shattering', 'personal', 'news', 'dispatched', 'talk', 'potential', 'jumper', 'ledge', 'only', 'discover', 'jump', 'else', 'someone', 'will', 'die', 'Add', 'immediately', 'gripping', 'opening', 'scene', 'superb', 'acting', 'involved', 'as', 'well', 'strong', 'thought-provoking', 'screenplay', ""'ve"", 'got', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'then', 'discussing', 'length', 'afterwards.So', 'why', 'do', 'reviews', 'call', 'too', 'contrived', 'thus', 'unwatchable', 'suggest', 'current', 'obsession', 'so-called', 'realism', 'contemporary', 'entertainment', 'blame', 'Yes', 'story', 'bit', 'stagey', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'Ironically', 'film', 'atheism', 'fundamentalism', 'odds', 'very', 'much', 'Medieval', 'mystery', 'play', 'characters', 'represent', 'certain', 'specific', 'worldviews', 'aspects', 'human', 'existence', 'short', 'as', 'much', 'allegory', 'straight', 'narrative', 'was', 'once', 'acceptable', 'form', 'storytelling', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'quite', 'few', 'films', 'TV', 'shows', '1950s', '1960s', 'Now', 'however', 'emphasis', 'rather', 'generic', 'homogenized', 'realism', 'fact', 'just', 'contrived', 'artificial', 'other', 'form', 'storytelling', 'end', 'difficult', 'viewers', 'enter', 'story', 'ideas.Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'deter', 'seeing', 'though', 'Unlike', 'so', 'many', 'formulaic', 'empty', 'film', 'spectacles', 'days', 'Ledge', 'intense', 'story', 'well-rounded', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'plenty', 'ideas', 'grapple', 'ideas', 'faith', 'about', 'belief', 'love', 'self-sacrifice', 'meaning', 'life', 'such', 'meaning', 'Again', 'characters', 'are', 'part', 'allegorical', 'ones', ""'re"", 'also', 'recognizable', 'individuals', 'painful', 'complex', 'backstories', 'make', 'sympathize', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'particular', 'worldviews.So', 'film', 'approach', 'might', 'put', 'off', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'comfortable', 'style', 'storytelling', 'can', 'give', ""'ll"", 'find', 'fascinated', 'lives', 'characters', 'terrible', 'choices', 'must', 'make', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'wind', 'up', 'thinking', 'own', 'beliefs', 'choices', 'make', 'everyday', 'as', 'well', 'rare', 'find', 'film', 'today', 'what', 'one', 'so', 'refreshing', 'striking', 'highly', 'recommended']",The Ledge
