This is the major premise behind all the Jenifer Lopez films. This film utilizes the identical premise. But this film goes seriously over the line in having Hispanics (primarily Mexicans) overtly denigrate, control and demean Whites. The so-called White is portrayed by a 'sweet', subservient and recessive male dominated by an overbearing and obnoxious Mexican family; which calls him a 'dancing bear' and blackmails him. This is the mentality displayed now by all the states physically and governmentally taken over by the Mexican state--all of Southern California, the entire states of New Mexico and Arizona and Southern Texas.

However, every single person in this movie is a terrible, horrible actor.

But we're supposed to believe the sister is straight from Mexico and she has NO accent whatsoever?  She has better English language skills than the people on my block! OK, so if the movie is trying to make a point why, to the other extreme, do some actors play the stereotypical immigrant so heavily that it is just painful/embarrassing to watch?I couldn't watch the whole movie because the acting was so bad.

773268,A3T3KPW2QE866W,B0000C2IWL,leelee,"[3, 3]","This is an entertaining but mild love-hate comedy starring the lovely & talented Laura Harring in a lead role. She plays a hot-tempered & strong-willed Latina woman who marries for a green card. She's not at all the monster that she's made out to be by her brother - singer ""Gerardo"". It's probably the director's fault for not having her play the role to the hilt. This is the only flaw of the film. That would have been fun to watch, and allowed Ms. Harring to stretch her acting skills. However, her character here comes across as generally sweet and sort of like mild salsa. There's no vindictiveness - think of how good ""War of the Roses"" was with Michael Douglas & Kathleen Turner. Yet, it's nice to see Laura in all her gorgeous beauty for 90 minutes here rather in brief supporting roles where she only gets a few seconds of camera time. The chemistry between the leads is pretty good. The singer formerly known as ""Gerardo"" is excellent as the bossy brother-in-law. I especially liked the scene where he goes in for an image make-over and the hairstylist wants to shave off his moustache. Overall, it's a satisfying comedy but could have been better if the script called for more of a battle between the sexes.

You might get the wrong impression that Loco Love is similar to that funny little movie that surprised and amused a lot of viewers, but in reality the only similarity lies in the fact that both movies deal with cultural differences and marriage.Loco Love has one of the poorest and humourless scripts I have seen in a long while, and tries too hard to extract laughter, but delivering the most painful sitting outside a dentist chair.The wealthy wife of a man ditches him and leaves him penniless and jobless out of her family restaurant business.In comes his lottery winner hispanic gardener offering to buy him a restaurant of his own if he agrees to marry his fiery sister, desperate for a green card.
