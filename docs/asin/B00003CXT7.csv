Rene Zellweger is charming and funny as a slightly overweight publisher. Colin Firth is very fresh as a top notch lawyer, and Hugh Grant is amazing as a head publisher(...)This story tells of Bridget Jones, who is an alcoholic and slightly overweight, but very lovely British woman who wants to change her ways and get a boyfriend. She finds her man in no time, Daniel Cleaver, who is her boss, but shortly finds out that he is NOT the man she's been looking for. In a strange turn of events, Bridget quits her job and finds another as a TV personality. After more events, mad depresssion, getting hung over, a (REAL) fight, and a divorce in the family, she finds the truth about jerky Mark and Daniel, and finds true love. But it wasn't easy for her after she finds out of his engagement to a dull, boring woman who is also his patrner in law, Natasha.YOu'll love this movie and find it charming and frickin' funny!",5,"""Bridget used to run around naked in my paddling pool""",1089676800,"07 13, 2004",2004,992,"['BRAVO', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'movie', 'truly', 'amazingly', 'unique', 'hilarious', 'Rene', 'Zellweger', 'charming', 'funny', 'slightly', 'overweight', 'publisher', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'very', 'fresh', 'top', 'notch', 'lawyer', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'amazing', 'head', 'publisher', 'story', 'tells', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'who', 'alcoholic', 'slightly', 'overweight', 'very', 'lovely', 'British', 'woman', 'who', 'change', 'ways', 'get', 'boyfriend', 'man', 'time', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'who', 'boss', 'shortly', 'out', 'NOT', 'man', 'been', 'looking', 'strange', 'turn', 'events', 'Bridget', 'job', 'TV', 'personality', 'more', 'events', 'mad', 'depresssion', 'getting', 'hung', 'REAL', 'fight', 'divorce', 'family', 'truth', 'jerky', 'Mark', 'Daniel', 'true', 'love', 'was', ""n't"", 'easy', 'engagement', 'dull', 'boring', 'woman', 'who', 'also', 'patrner', 'law', 'Natasha.YOu', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie', 'find', 'charming', 'frickin', 'funny']",Bridget Jones's Diary
536272,ACG9G4B6B93AA,B00003CXT7,Adam A. Crane,"[4, 5]","This movie was an agreeable way to blow 90 minutes. Perhaps its greatest virtue is it encourages one to read or watch Pride and Prejudice (again).Please note: I have not read the book, Bridget Jones's Diary.Hugh Grant, as Daniel Cleaver, or Wickham-lite, provides the best comedy. Charmingly sleazy. I liked how he referred to Bridget Jones by her last name, so I'm going to have emulate him in this review. In my opinion he was under-used. Even when he gets his come-uppence in the office, with Jones making a crack and everyone ha-ha-ing at the boss, in his eyes you can see a witty report but on film he says nothing. A lost opportunity.Colin Frith is excellent of course. I find it difficult to describe his acting with his eyes when he is looking at the woman he loves. They show, at the very least, that he needs and wants her while at the same time exhibiting an uncertain pain and a questioning doubt of her ability to love him. A very similar look was used by him in A&Es; Pride and Prejudice, incidentally, an excellent film.Renee Zwelleger was alright. She had some loopy charm (I really liked her frizzed-out 1980s coiffure), but very little depth--which didn't seem to be her fault, rather the script's. She looked great, its hard for me to believe so much fuss was made about the weight she put on.Several things were irritating about this film. In my opinion, having old people talk about their sex lives in order for the protagonist to show exasperated disgust and get a cheap laugh from the audience is lousy, desperate comedy. And several of the jokes seemed really dumbed down, like the audience couldn't figure out the humor without an arrow draw above it: for example, it kills the humor to have the mother introducing, hanging around, and then pointedly leaving Jones and D'Arcey alone together.The blaring love songs I can tolerate. However, the several slow-motions were ridiculous and unitentionally funny. It also seemed strange to me that the diary, in the movie anyway, is not very important at all, merely an afterthought. Only at the end does it provide a curve for the lovers to overcome.",2,Whets the appetite for Pride & Prejudice,1011744000,"01 23, 2002",2002,2119,"['movie', 'was', 'agreeable', 'way', 'blow', '90', 'minutes', 'Perhaps', 'greatest', 'virtue', 'one', 'read', 'watch', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'again', '.Please', 'note', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary.Hugh', 'Grant', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'Wickham-lite', 'best', 'comedy', 'Charmingly', 'sleazy', 'liked', 'how', 'referred', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'last', 'name', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'emulate', 'review', 'opinion', 'was', 'under-used', 'Even', 'when', 'come-uppence', 'office', 'Jones', 'making', 'crack', 'everyone', 'ha-ha-ing', 'boss', 'eyes', 'can', 'see', 'witty', 'report', 'film', 'nothing', 'lost', 'opportunity.Colin', 'Frith', 'excellent', 'course', 'find', 'difficult', 'describe', 'acting', 'eyes', 'when', 'looking', 'woman', 'show', 'very', 'least', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'exhibiting', 'uncertain', 'pain', 'questioning', 'doubt', 'ability', 'love', 'very', 'similar', 'look', 'was', 'used', 'A', 'Es', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'incidentally', 'excellent', 'film.Renee', 'Zwelleger', 'was', 'alright', 'had', 'loopy', 'charm', 'really', 'liked', 'frizzed-out', '1980s', 'coiffure', 'very', 'little', 'depth', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'fault', 'rather', 'script', 'looked', 'great', 'hard', 'believe', 'so', 'much', 'fuss', 'was', 'made', 'weight', 'put', 'on.Several', 'things', 'were', 'irritating', 'film', 'opinion', 'having', 'old', 'people', 'talk', 'sex', 'lives', 'order', 'protagonist', 'show', 'exasperated', 'disgust', 'get', 'cheap', 'laugh', 'audience', 'lousy', 'desperate', 'comedy', 'several', 'jokes', 'seemed', 'really', 'dumbed', 'down', 'audience', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'humor', 'arrow', 'draw', 'example', 'humor', 'have', 'mother', 'introducing', 'hanging', 'around', 'then', 'pointedly', 'leaving', 'Jones', ""D'Arcey"", 'alone', 'blaring', 'love', 'songs', 'can', 'tolerate', 'However', 'several', 'slow-motions', 'were', 'ridiculous', 'unitentionally', 'funny', 'also', 'seemed', 'strange', 'diary', 'movie', 'anyway', 'not', 'very', 'important', 'merely', 'afterthought', 'Only', 'end', 'provide', 'curve', 'lovers', 'overcome']",Bridget Jones's Diary

Not even when we're putting on the most ridiculous, toe-curling English accent imaginable, like Zellweger did.  I remember stories in the press about her ""blending in"" at a London publishing house.  Americans aren't aware of this, but London publishing houses are full of obnoxious twits who are ALL putting on a posh accent, so they probably thought Zellweger was some lass from the Midlands trying to sound rich.The film itself is not nearly as good as the book.  The book revolved around Bridget as well, but not to the extent that this film does.  It revolves around Bridget to the exclusion of all others.  This is why in the film her reasons for falling in love with Colin Firth's character are incomprehensible.  Firth and Hugh Grant were spot-on as their respective characters, the anal retentive barrister and the womanizing boss, but Zellweger's hammy performance ruins the entire movie.  I may be mistaken, but the impression I get from the film is that we are supposed to be sympathizing with Bridget and rooting her on.  I personally got a lot of enjoyment watching her fall on her face, arse, and other body parts.  I wanted her to fail, not to succeed.  That is how hateful Zellweger's Bridget was.  Also, I don't see how I'm supposed to believe for an instant that Bridget is overweight.  In the book, she got up to about 140 pounds.  Zellweger at her heaviest still looks to be about 10-15 pounds off the mark.  The frumpy Bridget from the book is nothing like the stick-thin Bridget that Zellweger presented us with.  She has agreed to do the second film but has refused to gain 20 pounds again to play the character, which will ruin the character still further.Other faults with the film:1.)  Cameos by famous British authors.  STOP IT.2.)  Not nearly enough Perpetua.3.)  Vile Richard did not even appear on screen.4.)  Bridget is rich.  I don't feel sorry for the wealthy.5.)  Bridget is a drunk.  Drunks are pathetic.I thoroughly enjoyed both books, but I was not impressed by this film with its poor character development, laughable script, and slapdash, ham-handed performance by Zellweger.  Someone ought to tell Americans to STOP TRYING TO SOUND ENGLISH.  The British press did not heavily criticize Zellweger's accent, but I think that was only because they didn't want to hurt her feelings.Bleccccccccccccccccch.",3,Zellweger v.v. bad.,1014854400,"02 28, 2002",2002,2406,"[""'m"", 'native', 'Texan', 'living', 'Britain', 'Trust', 'do', ""n't"", 'blend', 'Not', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'putting', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'toe-curling', 'English', 'accent', 'imaginable', 'Zellweger', 'did', 'remember', 'stories', 'press', 'blending', 'London', 'publishing', 'house', 'Americans', 'are', ""n't"", 'aware', 'London', 'publishing', 'houses', 'are', 'full', 'obnoxious', 'twits', 'who', 'are', 'ALL', 'putting', 'posh', 'accent', 'probably', 'thought', 'Zellweger', 'was', 'lass', 'Midlands', 'trying', 'sound', 'rich.The', 'film', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'book', 'book', 'revolved', 'around', 'Bridget', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'extent', 'film', 'around', 'Bridget', 'exclusion', 'others', 'why', 'film', 'reasons', 'falling', 'love', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'character', 'are', 'incomprehensible', 'Firth', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'were', 'spot-on', 'respective', 'characters', 'anal', 'retentive', 'barrister', 'womanizing', 'boss', 'Zellweger', 'hammy', 'performance', 'entire', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'mistaken', 'impression', 'get', 'film', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'sympathizing', 'Bridget', 'rooting', 'personally', 'got', 'lot', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'fall', 'face', 'arse', 'other', 'body', 'parts', 'wanted', 'fail', 'not', 'succeed', 'how', 'hateful', 'Zellweger', 'Bridget', 'was', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'instant', 'Bridget', 'overweight', 'book', 'got', 'up', '140', 'pounds', 'Zellweger', 'heaviest', 'still', 'be', '10-15', 'pounds', 'mark', 'frumpy', 'Bridget', 'book', 'nothing', 'stick-thin', 'Bridget', 'Zellweger', 'presented', 'agreed', 'do', 'second', 'film', 'refused', 'gain', '20', 'pounds', 'again', 'play', 'character', 'will', 'ruin', 'character', 'still', 'faults', 'film:1', 'Cameos', 'famous', 'British', 'authors', 'STOP', 'IT.2', 'Not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'Perpetua.3', 'Vile', 'Richard', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'appear', 'screen.4', 'Bridget', 'rich', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sorry', 'wealthy.5', 'Bridget', 'drunk', 'Drunks', 'are', 'pathetic.I', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'books', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'film', 'poor', 'character', 'development', 'laughable', 'script', 'slapdash', 'ham-handed', 'performance', 'Zellweger', 'Someone', 'ought', 'tell', 'Americans', 'STOP', 'TRYING', 'TO', 'SOUND', 'ENGLISH', 'British', 'press', 'did', 'not', 'heavily', 'criticize', 'Zellweger', 'accent', 'think', 'was', 'only', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'hurt', 'feelings.Bleccccccccccccccccch']",Bridget Jones's Diary

Her overbearing mother keeps trying to set her up with Mark Darcy (Colin Firth from the BBC &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;), whom Bridget despises.The plot bears a vague resemblance to &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; overall -- making Firth's casting rather clever, especially given Bridget's obsession with him in the second book, &quot;Edge of Reason.&quot;As in &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; our heroine discovers that the handsome, charming man is not quite what he seems -- and neither is the proud, arrogant one.The dialogue here is clever and the acting is superb.

And the truth is there is a bit of Bridget Jones in every woman, and that is what I find enchanting about this movie.Finally I see this ""imperfect"" perfect heroine, funny to the point of beeing ridiculuos, not so self assured, dealing with the trauma of loneliness, social pressure about marriage, trying to find the ""Mr. Right"", afraid to be a ""tragic spinster"" in her 30's, weight-obssesed and trying to quit: food, alcohol and smoking, a real woman, that's what she is!!Irony is the key element of this movie, even when it goes far away with it, it had made me think a lot about real life, and I guess life goes far with irony most of the time too!!""This movie is a searing vision of the wounds our (last and present) century has inflicted on traditional femininity"", where wicked [typical] just-bone-and-skin girls are showed to be the right example of beauty, a time when women have to be ""more clever"" than anyone to be taken seriously at work, and even though we are beeing exposed to alcohol and cigarettes advertising all the time and everywhere (I know in USA not anymore), have to be able to say ""no"" because ""perfect woman model"" has to have all this healthy habits, and be always clean and nice-smelling, well dressed and hair perfectly combed all the time, if not the character usually is ""the weird one"" who has to change. So, all I have to say is:""I LOVE BRIDGET!!!"" She is the first female character that doesn't make me feel bad about myself as a mortal beeing, she is full of normal flaws, with normal worries, and a normal HEART. And, thank God!! She finds true love for beeing ""just as she is"".I certainly believe that love can be found in the most unexpected person, that the person who really loves you does everything to help and support you to be a better person, not to change who you are, and if that person gets to know you in your worst moment and still likes you, well, IT'S A KEEPER.I do believe Ren&eacute;e Zellweger deserved the Oscar as best actress, because her performing was flawless, you could read every emotion in her character all the time, even in her slightest gesture. You could see the change in her weight from ups and downs, hard thing to do!! But she looked very beautiful with those extra pounds, maybe should consider to keep them, or at least some of them. I can say the rest of the cast was well chosen, and the director did an excellent job, with simple and clean cinematographic language but taking care of the most insignificant detail to be perfect. I actually like the way the soundtrack of the movie, a selection of songs, matched very well with every moment of the movie, bringing an hilarious, warming and less presumptuous touch.I have seen both ending credits from the american and the english versions, and I can say both are excellent, but if you have seen only the american ending credits version, where some characters tell their opinions about the new realtionship of Bridget, you just have to see the english version, because it's a home-made 8mm movie of Bridget and Mark in their childhood, when she used to ""run naked in his paddling pool"", absolutely adorable!!And, from now on, Colin Firth has entered in the private club of delicious, sexy, charming and adorable males from movies I like.",5,Fun:100%(Vg) Heartwarming:100%(good!!)

I almost didn't see this movie, because I had glanced at Helen Fielding's novel, which the film is based on, and it didn't seem interesting at all. In fact, my co-worker and I used to make fun of the book. So naturally, when I saw that they were actually making a movie out of the book, I groaned, thinking it was a stupid idea.Boy, was I wrong. Bridget Jones's Diary is the best romantic comedy I think I have ever seen. It's sweet and charming, and it has some real laugh-out-loud moments. The heart of the film is Renee Zellweger, who is not British but who does such a wonderful British accent, you would never know she is American. She does a beautiful job as Bridget. Hugh Grant is excellent, as usual. I think he's at his best when his characters are jerks and players. And Colin Firth, whom I had never seen before, is outstanding as Mark Darcy, the straight-laced, never-seems-to-smile foe/friend/romantic interest of Bridget's.My co-worker finally watched it the other day and loved it. After discussing it for a few minutes, I remembered how much I loved it, and went right home that day and watched it again! The DVD includes behind-the-scenes featurettes, a couple of music videos, deleted scenes, and director's commentary. The only thing missing, in my opinion, is a cast commentary. The three leads all have great chemistry together, and it would have been interesting to get their input. But other than that, I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys romantic comedies. Yes, it's a chick flick, but I think it's one that could even appeal to guys as well.

Don't get your knickers in a twist Duckie, I'll hop right to the point - I bloody LOVE this film.Loosely inspired by Pride and Prejudice, but in a way Ms. Austin never intended, what with all the shagging and all, the movie is not exactly like Ms. Fielding's book either.  One of things I liked about the book was the little diary notes, which obviously couldn't be brought out the same way in the movie, and quite a few other side stories had to be scrapped as well, including the entire ending.  Bridget's friends and family have had their parts drastically cut, to make way for a first class compact comedy, focused almost entirely on Bridget, Daniel (loving the beaver) Cleaver, and Mark Darcy.Never-the-less, like the book, the movie is a laugh out loud affair, with Renee Zellweger accurately capturing the spirit of the awkward and ditsy Bridget, Hugh Grant being the consummate cad, and Colin Firth (sigh) replaying an updated yet still straitlaced Darcy.Guest appearances by Salman Rushdie and Jeffrey Archer add a little literary support, and the DVD is loaded with features like deleted scenes, comments from the actors and director, as well as from Helen Fielding.My suggestion would be to read the book first, then watch the movie.Amanda Richards, June 5, 2005",5,Makes me feel all warm and British inside.,1117843200,"06 4, 2005",2005,1411,"['Right', 'then', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'absolutely', 'super', 'movie', 'am', 'now', 'going', 'piddle', 'around', 'acting', 'rather', 'terribly', 'British', 'what', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'knickers', 'twist', 'Duckie', ""'ll"", 'hop', 'right', 'point', 'bloody', 'LOVE', 'film.Loosely', 'inspired', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'way', 'Ms.', 'Austin', 'never', 'intended', 'what', 'shagging', 'movie', 'not', 'exactly', 'Ms', 'Fielding', 'book', 'either', 'One', 'things', 'liked', 'book', 'was', 'little', 'diary', 'notes', 'obviously', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'brought', 'out', 'same', 'way', 'movie', 'quite', 'few', 'other', 'side', 'stories', 'had', 'be', 'scrapped', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'entire', 'ending', 'Bridget', 'friends', 'family', 'have', 'had', 'parts', 'drastically', 'cut', 'make', 'way', 'first', 'class', 'compact', 'comedy', 'focused', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Bridget', 'Daniel', 'loving', 'beaver', 'Cleaver', 'Mark', 'Darcy.Never-the-less', 'book', 'movie', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'affair', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'accurately', 'capturing', 'spirit', 'awkward', 'ditsy', 'Bridget', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'being', 'consummate', 'cad', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'sigh', 'replaying', 'updated', 'yet', 'still', 'straitlaced', 'Darcy.Guest', 'appearances', 'Salman', 'Rushdie', 'Jeffrey', 'Archer', 'add', 'little', 'literary', 'support', 'DVD', 'loaded', 'features', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'comments', 'actors', 'director', 'as', 'well', 'Helen', 'Fielding.My', 'suggestion', 'would', 'be', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'then', 'watch', 'movie.Amanda', 'Richards', 'June', '5', '2005']",Bridget Jones's Diary

Yes, the character of Bridget Jones alone is worth the price of admission, but it's what Zellweger does with the character that will keep you hooked.  The film, which is basically a modern retelling of `Pride and Prejudice', centers around an overweight and underloved young woman named Bridget.  Bridget records in her diary her troubles with her weight as well as her troubles with men (ALL BY MYSELF).  Things change when Bridget becomes emotionally torn between the handsome Mark and her boss, Daniel.  Mark is a little distant but wholly more desirable (in the long term) than Daniel, who is a womanizer and is basically using Bridget for one thing.  But, at least Daniel is using her.

Bridget, Ren&eacute;e Zellweger's character, ends up doing a new year resolution and starts to avoid her feel-good cigarrettes (casual or post-sexual activity) and lots of other things that had become a vice for her. The picture is filled with super funny situations, for example the costumes party where she ends up dressing as a funny-as-hell bunny with a white round tail.Although I enjoyed this movie very much, I don't think it's a best-buy choice to buy the VHS or DVD versions of the movie, I'm sorry but I just can't personally see myself watching this movie over and over again.

She has suffered through the ghastly fix ups and the constant inquiries into her love life to the point an affair with the office snake seems appealing.This show is different with its British based sense of humor, so it is fresh in that respect.  Renee Zellwenger, put on some weight to more truthfully represent the average woman.  She also has the average woman's friends; all quite odd and suffering together.  Renee does a marvelous job at sticking her foot in her mouth as Bridget and often, no always says the wrong thing.  In other words, a portrayal of a real human being.  Her lipsynch with the song: &quot;All by myself&quot; alone in her room is one we can all sympathize with.The story focuses on a time in her life where everything kicks in: Potential relationships, family problems and job dilemmas.  All the typical stuff the rest of us deal with, and as usual, all go down the drain at the same time.Viewers of the old &quot;Life and Times of Molly Dodd&quot; TV series will particularly like this movie.

536298,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B00003CXT7,barry,"[3, 4]","Finally we get the superb romantic comedy BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY on blu ray.  It has been a long time coming for all of its fans and the first question will of course be whether it is worth double dipping.  How much better is the blu ray presentation than the dvd.  I can happily say it far surpasses it.  I want to start by saying this splendid film has in no way aged and the story rings true as fresh as ever.  And this film is in no way just a chick flick.  Yes, it is a romantic comedy but it has a depth and realism that makes it something both women and men will like.  Renee Zellweger reigns supreme here as Bridget and provides slapstick comedy at its best while making you love and care for her underdog character.  Colin Firth and Hugh Grant are superbly cast as the male leads and the romantic foils for Bridget.  This is indeed a truly heartwarming tale.Now for the blu ray.  I was very excited to see how pristine the video presentation is.  Colors pop brightly and skin tones are fresh and natural.  Black/white ratio is excellent.  The clarity and crispness is certainly what brings this film to new life.  The audio is 5.1 DTS-HD Master and works superbly.  Dialogue is always strong and present and the surround speakers get good use when need be.  But the music is a big part of this film and represents each milestone in Bridget's journey from Chaka Khan to Diana Ross and in those moments all the speakers come to life in  a glorious style that raises the emotional level of this film to an even higher caliber.  BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY is a superb film that gains new life with its blu ray release.

I loved this movie.  The script was a well-done adaptation and it is very fun to watch.I was very surprised by the performance of Hugh Grant.  He typically gets cast in the romantic lead role, playing some sort of charming, bumbling idiot that you can't help but fall in love with.  This movie, he actually tries something different.  He still plays an idiot, but this time he's the sort of idiot you love to hate.  It's a nice change.  And, if there are any of you out there who hate Hugh Grant, this is the movie for you--there is a particular scene that you'll love (but I don't want to ruin it for you).Colin Firth also does a marvelous job.  His character is probably one of the most interesting in the movie (aside from Bridget herself).  He progresses in a way that you don't really expect from the beginning, and it's rather nice.  I love Colin Firth.If you're in a bad mood, this is a great movie to see.  It fits the romantic comedy mold, but it's good to watch even if you're not a fan of that genre.

In the commercials, Bridget Jones is portrayed as a suave young woman in her mid-twenties. However, I realized different when I watched the movie.  Bridget Jones' diary takes place in Britain. The main character, Bridget (played by Renee Zelwigger) tells the audience about her past. We realize that she does not ordinarily have boyfriends, and , when her mother tries to set her up with a man, we find out why. We also realize that Bridget is not suave at all, which she realizes herself that New Year. She finds herself all alone, again, and makes a resolution to start a diary, among other things. Finally after consulting with her friends, she sends a naughty e-mail to her boss, who sends one back to her. After many such e-mails, her boss (played by Hugh Grant) asks her out. Later on, the man Bridget's mother tried to set her up with develops a crush on Bridget. Soon, Bridget is in the center of a love triangle and she must decide which man is Mr. Right.

Thank God for the years of selfless campaigning for the rights of women while fighting against oppressive domination. As a result the silver screen is proud to present it's first female role model of the new millennium. Bridget Jones.OH MY GOD.What does Ms Jones do with her hard won liberty? She spends her life looking for the perfect man to marry.Bridget, a 32-year-old, single white female - played by Renee Zellweger - works in the PR department of a publishing house and lives alone. She spends her nights drinking vodka and worrying about dying a lonely death as an old spinster and being eaten by her pet dogs. Bidget has surely spent too many long evenings in front of the tele watching repeats of Ally McBeal and Sex In The City. Looking for the perfect man? There's a large haystack without a needle.During the day she's at the office, working for a sexist, womanising cad of a boss - Hugh Grant - with whom she decides definitely not to have a relationship. They exchange sexy emails about the shortness of her skirt and the niceness of her chest, before embarking on a relationship.Prior to bedding the boss, Bridget bumps into the beastly Mark Darcy - Colin Firth - at her parents annual curried turkey New Year's day dinner party. They don't really hit it off and she hopes never to see the rude, unemotional human rights lawyer again. You can guess what follows.If the plot sounds a tad familiar, then well done for paying attention during those dry old English lit classes at school. Thanks to a ouija board and a pack of tarot card, Helen Fielding, the writer of Bridget Jones's Diary (newspaper column, best selling novels and now smash hit film), was able to collaborate with the very dead Jane Austen and use the plot from Pride and Prejudice.In fact Colin Firth shot to stardom following his role as Mr Darcy in the BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, a few years ago. In it he played an unemotional, over privileged, rude man with an upper lip so stiff it could be used as a load bearing wall. This time his character is completely different as he doesn't wear tight breeches and overly high collars. The Noddy Holder sideburns are, thankfully, still in place.Luckily Hugh Grant was chosen to add spice and originality to the role of the fun loving cad. A part that needed the slimy ooziness of Terry Thomas or Leslie Phillips (ding dong). And Hugh gave a virtuoso performance as...well..ah...um......ah.....yes.......um......himself. Full marks to Hugh, he does play himself incredibly well, he really gets under his own skin. He is obviously method acting as you can genuinely believe he has fully become himself.If I've given the impression this film is mutton dressed up as lamb, then I need to put on my best Hugh Grant voice and say...ah.....um....sorry..........ah....ah..sorry.....yes.....sorry. As it isn't. It's a very good film. An incredibly enjoyable film that made popcorn shoot out of my mouth when unexpected laughter took hold of me (another sorry, this time to the people in row H). And there are lots of truly original moments, like the very English street fight between the two well brought-up men.Mr Grant and Mr Firth do act their socks off and are both very impressive. (But they have had a lot of practice at these two roles). Renee Zellweger is definitely the star of the film, making me cringe with embarrassment when she had to speak in public and I did end up hopping this mad middle class madam would eventually find happiness in something other than booze, food and fags.It was nice to see a leading lady sporting a normal body. No half starved twiglet suffering from I-want-the-waist-of-a-twelve-year-old-itus, with silicon balloons superglued to her chest cavity. It's the first time I've ever seen a big name actress with a bottom (described by her uncle as one you could park your bike in and rest your pint on). Although she was far from being fat.As for American Zellweger's English accent, it was really rather jolly good. A little strange at times and quite hard to fit a post code to, but if I hadn't known she was from the colonies I would have sworn she was from somewhere in the home counties.Poor Bridget Jones is from the Cosmopolitan generation. She's a women who learns her life skills from glossy magazines and self help books. She aspires to life long happiness with men who are barely equipped to deal with the emotional turmoil of boiling an egg. She was born into a middle class world where everyone must be happy all the time, but no one ever is. Bridget Jones was born to be a post feminist icon, women love her and identify with her, but would never, ever admit to being like her.How strange is that?",4,How strange are women?,1048032000,"03 19,

536304,A82MLYSUUU3CF,B00003CXT7,"Bil Antoniou ""Movie madness!""","[6, 8]","Brilliant adaptation of Helen Fielding's acerbic novel about the day-to-day life of the titular boozing, smoking and somewhat ungraceful little lass played with career-topping zeal by Renee Zellweger (who manages her Britishness perfectly). In adapting her novel to the screen, Fielding and her two colleagues (which include her good friend and Four Weddings and a Funeral scribe Richard Curtis) have pared down her witty but sometimes repetitive novel, keeping in the best moments, and amalgamating some of the others to even greater effect. Zellweger is matched ably by her two co-stars, in one corner the sexy but vile Daniel (Hugh Grant), and in the other corner the stiff but always-too-honest Mark Darcy (Colin Firth, a brilliant riff on his Darcy character in Pride and Prejudice), both of whom are vying for the lady's attention.

536305,A3AF8P0GINFADV,B00003CXT7,Black Barbie,"[2, 2]","'Bridget Jones Diary' is an exuberant film based on the book of the same name. This hilarious comedy is centered on Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger), a 30-something single woman who works at a publishing company where she has an affair with her boss Daniel (Hugh Grant). This is where the fun begins and from this point onwards, her childhood friend turned nemesis Mark Darcy (played with sarcastic finesse by Colin Firth) becomes hesitantly interested in her but unfortunately because of twisted lies, Bridget is completely antagonistic towards him. The film continues to show that Bridget has two men to choose from: the womanising Hugh Grant or the composed Colin Firth. Which man does she choose? The film is great in confusing the audience while adding extra dimensions by explaining other subplots.Some people might say that this film is too light-hearted to be taken seriously but it is such a laughter-riot that it makes the viewer remember that films don't always have to be serious and you can laugh and enjoy a film with a top cast.Zellweger is great in portraying the self-conscious Bridget Jones, Grant = smooth as the arrogant publishing boss and Firth is fantastic at what he does best : the calm and aloof lawyer.The DVD is not great at all - where are the extensive foreign subtitles that are on most DVDs?

Sure it's sappy at times, but more often it is something I have far more regard for--hilarious.  Zellweger plays Bridget perfectly, portraying her awkwardness in a way that makes her loveable and endearing, an anti-heroine for a genre so saturated in Julia Roberts that it is disgusting (sorry if no one understands what I mean by this, but it IS true).And of course, there is Mark Darcy, played by Colin Firth.  Firth is by nature perfect for this role, as it was designed for him, and I am afraid I will not understand any woman who does not fall in love with him--or rather his characters, I grudgingly suppose.

536316,A13GEXUA4SJ8J5,B00003CXT7,Carol Hunt,"[4, 10]","This movie is attempting to cloak a backlash ideology in a type of imitation-feminism.  Bridget Jones is the remake of Elizabeth Bennett from Pride and Prejudice without the intellectual capacity, class, and dignity. In the original story Elizabeth Bennett is not perfect; this idea of imperfection becomes a repeated theme in the Jones movie with one big difference--Jones lacks virtues.  Bennett's imperfections are also her virtues; she was blunt but by being forthcoming she was wise. In this new make Bridget is self-defacing.  She views herself as inadequate and the only way that she can fix her flaws is by gaining the affections of a male.  The heroine does not like herself.Over and over again the heroine puts herself down while repeatedly making the same mistakes.  She is a poor public speaker, but rather than avoid public speaking or get coaching she continually makes a fool of herself and this is supposed to be what is lovable about her.  I think that we can all identify with not doing things well, but Jones repeatedly bashes herself in the movie.  She calls herself a spinster and has several ""Bridget has done it again"" moments.  I think that there is a good argument that woman are being pressured to be so successful that any woman actually attempting to work and be glamorous and intelligent and do everything correctly will eventual have doubts about her abilities, but this film makes fun of heroine.  We aren't to question whether society has an expectation for women now that they cannot meet, we are simply supposed to laugh at this protagonist for failing all the time. A single woman struggling is now hilarious?Another problem is that at 30 her life does not resemble the typical 30 year old's.  She has no children. Utterly no dependents. Virtually no responsibility yet she cannot perform her job. How many female incompetent bachlorettes do you know? We are supposed to identify with her because she wears baggy underwear when she wants to be sexy.  Bridget tries to be a playgirl but doesn't know how.  She is too stupid.  The underlying message that I get is that no woman is really able to enjoy casual sex; she must mess it up, not enjoy it, or be mocked for her attempts.  Another issue is that Bridget wants a relationship, but is messing around with what in layman's terms we call an absolute jerk.  She is so despite for a man that she accepts Grant even though his behavior is disrespectful to her in the extreme.  He sexually harasses her at work and she does not leave or feel outraged. I find that believable if she was younger, but at 30 most women have a more experience with men and understand the workings or a relationship were as a young woman may not.The problem with Darcy is that he is not very nice to her.  He insults her and treats her in a condescending manner.  She doesn't fight back.  She makes a fool of herself and he feels bad for her.  That is not the novel that I read.  The point of Pride and Prejudice is that Mr. Darcy is prejudice and recognizes that he is reproducing social class discrimination when Elizabeth Bennett rejects him in a blunt, passionate, and outstanding way.  She stands up for herself beautifully when she exclaims that she will never marry him [because he is so disrespectful]. There are no scenes like this in this movie. Darcy looks down on her much like a Ph.D scholar degrades a fast food worker, and Bridget in the end runs through the streets in her underwear so despite that he not leave her. After he treats her poorly, the best way that she can express herself in written word is to pen that she hates him in her diary.  She doesn't state way she hates him or why his disdainful attitude towards her hurts her.All problems stated, the worst is that Bridget isn't in a relationship because she met someone that she has an affinity.

I'd say that it was &quot;loosely&quot; based on the book. &quot;Barely&quot; based, actually. The characters were the same, but the events in the movie definitely were not. They either made up completely new situations, or condensed about six months worth of entries in Bridget's diary into one scene.Bridget's neuroticism (which sort of makes the book so funny) is replaced by a sort of down-to-earth quality, which was very strange for me to come to terms with. Bridget in the film is really determined to become a strong individual and has a few ephiphanies. It's very much at odds with Bridget-in-the-book's whole superficial self-help obsession. Bridget in the film is charming. Renee Zellweger plays her as a funny, charming woman who doesn't realize how appealing she really is. There is not a hint of Bridget's quirky self-obsession after the cringe worthy opening credits.Bridget's mom in the film was a frumpy hostess on an on-air shopping channel as opposed to being a talk show host, and there was nothing about her legal trouble either, which is a pretty important part of the book. It just wasn't the same at all. I guess I liked the book a lot more than I realized, to feel so strongly about this.Colin Firth was amazing. I'm not one to fall for characters or movie stars, but he just knocked me out. His Mark Darcy was incredibly appealing and likeable.I guess the major problem I had with the film is I *liked* the characters.

I'm all for a movie that champions a ""regular girl"" but the movie version of Bridget?  She has the luck of landing great jobs in competitive fields for which she's totally unqualified and inept, she's alcoholic and her vocabulary rivals that of an uneducated hooker. She doesn't try to educate herself or prepare properly for her jobs; she just wants to lose a few pounds and grab her guy. And yet, one of the sharpest legal minds in the country finds her fascinating? Uh huh.BTW, how Fielding had the guts and thought to pull in even tongue-in-cheek references to Pride and Prejudice is beyond me. This has absolutely nothing to do with P&P.; Bridget is the antithesis of Elizabeth Bennett.Zellweger actually looks better at he more normal Bridget weight, but she is by no means an overweight Bridget. She does her usual cute mugging for the camera and can handle a semi-decent British accent. I just wish she had made the character a more sympathetic and likable.I actually was put off by the language in the film, something that rarely happens when I watch a movie. I'm not offended by swearing in films, but soooo many repetitions of the ""F"" word--of ANY word-- starts getting ridiculous and annoying. The movie tries too hard to cram in edgy ""adult"" humor that actually comes off as painfully juvenile and boring. It takes away from the film and from Bridget herself. She winds up looking like a simpleton who keeps her mind constantly in the gutter.The only scene I found funny in the whole film was the fight scene. I'll give a star to that. It was amusing. Most of the movie, however, just kept me rolling my eyes and yawning. And wanting to tell Bridget to go to AA and enroll in a college course.

536324,A3IY28PW12MSVN,B00003CXT7,Christine Wong,"[2, 2]","As a huge fan of the books, I had incredibly high expectations of the movie. In order for the movie to work for me, it had to capture Bridget's plucky-heroine character and the hilarious-poignant emotions that are in the book. Needless to say, `Bridget Jones's Diary' the movie worked very, very, very well. Although Helen Fielding also wrote the screenplay (w/ Richard Curtis, very skilled with romantic comedies) and keeps the laughs coming, this movie could have fallen flat on its face. But it doesn't because one, the casting is absolutely divine and two, smartly builds on some elements the book downplays.Renee Zellweger is absolutely perfect as Bridget Jones. She has always been one of my favorite actresses and here, she totally displays Bridget's pathetic cuteness. Zellweger gained weight for this role, too, so she looks adorably plump. It's very, very hard to not fall in love with her the moment you see her at her family's Christmas party or drinking alone at home or listening to sad, Celine Dion music. (You have a heart of stone if you aren't moved to laughs or tears or pity for her.) I can't imagine anyone else playing Bridget Jones. Zellweger fits the role because she is very much normal and approachable...we can relate to her.As Daniel Cleaver (her caddish Cassanova lover/boss), Hugh Grant is smoldering and hilarious. (Ok, I might be a little biased because I've been in love with him for ages and ages, but you can't deny he is a great comedic actor.) There's no trace of his stuttering that we saw (and I loved) in `Four Weddings and a Funeral' or `Sense and Sensibility.' Grant morphs effortlessly into a cad that we all love to hate and all love to love. Yes, it's a paradox, but that is what Grant brings to his role. He makes being `bad' look so sexy. You can't take your eyes off him; he brings his own humor to his role. It's lovely, smoldering, and incredibly sexy.Colin Firth is also a delight to watch onscreen as Mark Darcy (I think I might be in love with him, too). He is also sexy and smoldering, but not in the same wild, fiery way as Daniel Cleaver. Firth brings a very cute sweetness to his role. I don't know if it is his adorable face or his hair or the way he dresses or just the fact that he is a major sex symbol, but you can't help but fall in love with him the MOMENT you see him onscreen. There is also one very beautiful moment where he tells Bridget, `I like you very much...just the way you are.' It's incredibly romantic and, for me, ranks right up there with Tom Cruise's `You complete me' in `Jerry Maguire.' He also has rather explosive chemistry with Renee Zellweger, which is moving and sexy all at the same time. (And, of course, the author Helen Fielding used Colin Firth as the basis for Mark Darcy, so it all works out marvelously.)I also mentioned that the movie smartly builds on some elements that the book downplays. Yes, there are certain parts of the movie that cannot be found in the book, but I'm still glad they put them in the movie. Most of what they added doesn't necessarily build on plot but it does add to the characters. I don't want to give anything away because it's rather hilarious what unfolds onscreen. The movie is filmed in an almost Ally McBeal type of way but it remains true to the sincerity, cuteness, and pathetic naivete that Bridget Jones embodies. There are no pretensions.

Although I heard all the adulation piled upon the film, there was a lingering worry in my mind that it might turn out to be just another tedious romantic comedy. In fact, &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot; is a breath of fresh air, resurrecting the romantic-comedy genre, pulling it out of realm of The Typical.First and foremost, the beautiful Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is a very gifted comedic actress. Her timing, her adorable facial expressions, and her willingness to let go and immerse herself in a role are all evident in &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary.&quot; I doubt another actress could have played Bridget with such charm and abandon. Zellweger allows the audience to peak into Jones's life without any reluctance, from exposing less-than-perfect legs to wearing a bunny outfit. Also of important mention...her accent! She carried the English accent brilliantly. After a while, I forgot she was American and completely believed her.Hugh Grant, usually known as the &quot;good guy,&quot; does a 180 degree turn here, playing the slimey jerk that is Daniel Cleaver to perfection. Handsome? Yes. Insulting? Absolutely. And every moment he is on screen is an entertaining one. Colin Firth, of whom I've never heard, also turns in a dramatic and terrific performance as Mark Darcy, the arrogant and contemptuous man who seems to pop up throughout the film. He plays off the hard-on-the-outside, soft-on-the-inside bit quite well. It is without doubt that American audiences will be seeing more of him in the near future!The best part is, this is a film you can watch again and again. The moments are often hilarious (the actors, fortunately, seem to be genuinely enjoying themselves), the jokes delivered sharply, and the pacing is near perfection. Most importantly, audiences can relate. Run-of-the-mill comedy it is not!

I thought it wouldn't do my chances with the girl any harm to be associated in her mind with a 'cute' Hollywood film star. My sexual predatoriness, of course, goes against the whole ethos of the movie, which is all about a plump English girl trying to find 'trooooo love.'(...)Watching this film made me very aware that men and women have radically different itineries.Women nowadays like to think they can enjoy a bit of a fling and 'play the field' in the same way that men have traditionally done, but, just like Bridget Jones in this movie, their hearts are not really in it. The pleasure of the moment is never just the pleasure of the moment, but is forced to have greater significance. What they want, therefore, is 'sexual excitement' LEADING TO a 'meaningful relationship.' This is what Bridget so clearly wants, and is of course the reason why she, along with so many of her sex, is obsessed by her weight. This is also the reason Hugh Grant's plasure-loving cad is cast as the bad guy.As a man who also relishes a bit of pleasure and doesn't relish the prospect of being woven into one woman's cosy little domestic fantasy, I can't but find this movie offensive in the same way that an African American would find a racially inensitive movie offensive. Men are not mere adjuncts to feminine fantasy. We do not exist only to make their cosy little world safe and complete.

It is by no means a classic, but its charm and humor took it much further than the actual storyline, with was often trite and unbelievable.Still single and being set up on blind dates by her mother, Bridget (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger sporting a few extra pounds and a very good English accent), an overweight self-analyzing chainsmoker, suddenly finds herself being pursued by two men, one of whom is her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) at the publishing company where she works, the other being a childhood friend, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), who has a tense history with Cleaver.I don't suppose that sexual harrassment is as much of an issue in Britain as it is in America, given that Cleaver's comment about Bridget's breasts actually wins her over (they do look rather nicer than the usual Zellweger variety, by the way).This was Grant's first chance to play an unlikable character and his innate charm gives an extra layer to the despicable Cleaver -- even making us sympathize with him for a bit, at least until the revelation at the end. Firth plays Darcy as an allusion to the Pride and Prejudice character he portrayed for the BBC; it is obvious from the beginning that he is the man for whom we're supposed to be rooting, simply because he is so troubled. Author Helen Fielding said she always had him in mind for the role; lucky for him, his star had recently risen so that he could be considered.Zellweger is wonderful. I don't usually like her, but she gives Bridget a human side that wasn't apparent in the book (where she is all neuroses, pounds, and cigarettes) -- and she's funny!

Instead, she finds Hugh Grant, playing her sleazy boss, and Colin Firth, son of family friends who is an uptight and smug barrister.  Naturally, she chooses the sleazy boss first, then we follow her through a career change, a boyfriend change, multiple lifestyle changes (or, at least, attempts thereof), all accompanied by her loyal and equally single friends.This sounds like a very formulaic film, but the quirky character of Bridget Jones is carried off wonderfully by (the initially thought to be oddly cast) Renee Zellweger, who is a thin Texan playing a chubby Brit.  Zellweger really gets into the role, including gaining 20 (?) pounds.  Grant and Firth are equally well cast as the competing suitors; Grant as the sleaze has more fun and juicier lines.  In all, it is very funny, and quite universal - I'm sure audiences in America and Australia will enjoy it just as much as audiences in Britain.The DVD edition is quite nice, with a short making-of documentary (that thankfully is not simply an extended trailer), some cut scenes (some of which are a loss to the film, but others were rightfully cut), a couple music videos (not particularly interesting), and, of course, a director's commentary.  This commentary is pretty good, from first-time director Sharon Maguire, with tidbits on the actors, comments on how the film diverges from the novel, etc.The only problem is the ending - there are simply too many false crises delaying the happy ending that we know is coming.

Helen Fielding captured a certain time in a single woman's life (the early 30's) at a certain era in our cultural history (post women's lib, at a time when women are supposed to want it all, yet society still demands marriage). I, and most of my single female friends, related so strongly to the trials and tribulations of our heroine. The loving 'urban' family, the smug married friends, the sleazy bosses...are all true to life for so many contemporary women.The movie retains the charm of the book. Renee Zellwegger is a revealation as the chain smoking, food binging heroine. Yet she goes way beyond capturing the compulsions of Bridget-she also movingly portrays Bridget's more poignant sides and the lonliness many women (and men) feel in the dating jungle. Hugh Grant is his usual charming self. Yes he is nastier in this film but he still has a light and charming way about him. Colin Firthis wonderful.

536335,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B00003CXT7,Cubist,"[3, 3]","Before Bridget Jones's Diary was released in theatres, much was made of the casting of soft-spoken American (from Texas no less!), Renee Zellweger as the very British Bridget Jones. It was seen as almost heresy by fans of Helen Fielding's very popular book of the same name. To almost everyone's surprise, Zellweger pulled it off with a credible British accent and a real commitment to the role (she even put on weight). Now, on the eve of the new Bridget Jones movie-The Edge of Reason, Miramax has gone back to the well with a brand new Collector's Edition DVD that promises new extras but is it really worth the double-dip?There is an audio commentary with director Sharon Maguire. She comes across as soft-spoken but delivers an informative track as she talks at length about making the movie, praises her cast and discusses translating the book to the big screen.One of the new extras to this DVD is ""The Young and the Mateless (an expert's guide to being single)."" It examines the single women scene with soundbites from successful stories, like the editor-in-chief of Allure magazine and a writer from Sex and the City.""The Bridget Phenomenon"" is another new extra that looks at the success of the movie and how it perfectly epitomized single womanhood. There are interviews with Maguire and the cast with footage from the new movie. This is a nice look at the appeal of the Bridget Jones character.""Behind-the-Scenes Featurette"" is a slightly cheeky take on the standard promotional press kit with interview soundbites from the cast and crew mixed with clips from the movie.Another new extra is ""Portrait of the Makeup Artist,"" which features a profile on Graham Johnston who did the make-up for both Bridget Jones movies.There are also four TV spots advertising the movie which is new to this DVD.Seven deleted scenes totaling 11 minutes in length include an embarrassing marketing presentation that Bridget does for a book. There is also a nice scene between Bridget and her dad (Broadbent). Also of interest is an epilogue of sorts that is a sly homage to When Harry Met Sally (1989).There is also a theatrical trailer for the new Bridget Jones movie, The Edge of Reason.Fans of the original Helen Fielding columns are in for a treat as a collection of several of them from various years are included. They range from originals that inspired the first movie to more recent ones that make up the bulk of the second movie.A new extra to this DVD is ""A Guide to Bridget Britishisms"" that features clips from the movie explaining common British slang, like ""fanny about"", ""daft"" and ""wanker.""Finally, there are five reviews of the first movie from the likes of Rolling Stone, USA Today and Roger Ebert.Fans who have the first DVD that was released might want to hold on to it as the music videos by Shelby Lynne and Gabrielle are not included on this new one.Bridget Jones's Diary is much more than just the quintessential single woman's survival guide. It is a funny and engaging romantic comedy that champions a more realistic image of women. Bridget Jones is the photo negative of The Sex and the City women. She is not like them, with their perfect shoes and witty repartee. Bridget would be watching that show and not be on it. And this is part of the appeal of this movie to the average woman. This DVD is quite good. The new extras are entertaining but probably not worth buying the DVD over again unless you're a die hard Bridget fan.",4,Worth the double dip?,1100217600,"11 12, 2004",2004,3449,"['Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'was', 'released', 'theatres', 'much', 'was', 'made', 'casting', 'soft-spoken', 'American', 'Texas', 'less', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'very', 'British', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'was', 'seen', 'almost', 'heresy', 'fans', 'Helen', 'Fielding', 'very', 'popular', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'almost', 'everyone', 'surprise', 'Zellweger', 'pulled', 'off', 'credible', 'British', 'accent', 'real', 'commitment', 'role', 'even', 'put', 'weight', 'Now', 'eve', 'new', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'movie-The', 'Edge', 'Reason', 'Miramax', 'gone', 'back', 'well', 'brand', 'new', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'new', 'extras', 'really', 'double-dip', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Sharon', 'Maguire', 'soft-spoken', 'informative', 'track', 'length', 'making', 'movie', 'cast', 'translating', 'book', 'big', 'screen.One', 'new', 'extras', 'DVD', 'Young', 'Mateless', 'expert', 'guide', 'being', 'single', 'single', 'women', 'scene', 'soundbites', 'successful', 'stories', 'editor-in-chief', 'Allure', 'magazine', 'writer', 'Sex', 'City', 'Bridget', 'Phenomenon', 'new', 'extra', 'success', 'movie', 'how', 'perfectly', 'epitomized', 'single', 'womanhood', 'are', 'interviews', 'Maguire', 'cast', 'footage', 'new', 'movie', 'nice', 'look', 'appeal', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'character', 'Behind-the-Scenes', 'Featurette', 'slightly', 'cheeky', 'take', 'standard', 'promotional', 'press', 'kit', 'interview', 'soundbites', 'cast', 'crew', 'mixed', 'clips', 'movie.Another', 'new', 'extra', 'Portrait', 'Makeup', 'Artist', 'profile', 'Graham', 'Johnston', 'who', 'did', 'make-up', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'are', 'also', 'four', 'TV', 'spots', 'advertising', 'movie', 'new', 'DVD.Seven', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'totaling', '11', 'minutes', 'length', 'include', 'embarrassing', 'marketing', 'presentation', 'Bridget', 'book', 'also', 'nice', 'scene', 'Bridget', 'dad', 'Broadbent', 'Also', 'interest', 'epilogue', 'sorts', 'sly', 'homage', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', '1989', 'also', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'new', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'movie', 'Edge', 'Reason.Fans', 'original', 'Helen', 'Fielding', 'columns', 'are', 'treat', 'collection', 'several', 'various', 'years', 'are', 'included', 'range', 'originals', 'inspired', 'first', 'movie', 'more', 'recent', 'ones', 'make', 'up', 'bulk', 'second', 'movie.A', 'new', 'extra', 'DVD', 'A', 'Guide', 'Bridget', 'Britishisms', 'clips', 'movie', 'explaining', 'common', 'British', 'slang', 'fanny', 'daft', 'wanker', 'Finally', 'are', 'five', 'reviews', 'first', 'movie', 'likes', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'USA', 'Today', 'Roger', 'Ebert.Fans', 'who', 'have', 'first', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'might', 'want', 'hold', 'music', 'videos', 'Shelby', 'Lynne', 'Gabrielle', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'new', 'one.Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'quintessential', 'single', 'woman', 'survival', 'guide', 'funny', 'engaging', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'more', 'realistic', 'image', 'women', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'photo', 'negative', 'Sex', 'City', 'women', 'not', 'perfect', 'shoes', 'witty', 'repartee', 'Bridget', 'would', 'be', 'watching', 'show', 'not', 'be', 'part', 'appeal', 'movie', 'average', 'woman', 'DVD', 'quite', 'good', 'new', 'extras', 'are', 'entertaining', 'probably', 'not', 'worth', 'buying', 'DVD', 'again', ""'re"", 'die', 'hard', 'Bridget', 'fan']",Bridget Jones's Diary

The major drawback is only that the surprise twist of the end is quite patently forseeable at the more genuine surprise twist of the middle. Why Ms. Jones does not see the obvious in the middle can only be chalked up to a plot necessity and not human reasoning capabilities as practiced in the real world. Hence the whole late middle portion of the film I couldn't identify the least with her conflictedness, already clearly apprehending the bit of knowledge that would erase that conflictedness. So, I couldn't feel with her again until the end, when she finally got things straight as even a child could have a forty-five minutes or so earlier. Dramatically, I was already quite a bit lost by then. But I liked the end, the spin on romance, Hugh Grant's performance for reasons I won't mention out of fear of wrecking some of the plot.A well cast, well played, well written, well intentioned film about characters who are welcomably fresh and interesting for the romantic comedy genre.

I must admit, however, I was one of those skeptics that wasn't sure how well she would fair in the role from the best selling book by Helen Fielding.

As the loveable Bridget, she takes us through a year of her life, dealing with her troubles with men (Hugh Grant, Colin Firth) and her job and friends. Hugh Grant is good as the bad boy that treats her shabbily and Colin Firth is good, as well, as the stuffy, but good hearted man that continually crosses her path.

Created by novelist Helen Fielding, who also wrote the script, and brought to life by the talented and zany Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, Bridget Jones is a 32-year-old pleasingly plump London working girl, a ""...verbally incontinent spinster who...dresses like her mother"" (to quote Colin Firth's character, Mark Darcy). She is also clumsy, the kind of girl who might spill sauce on her blouse, a little overweight, smokes, drinks too much and sometimes says what she thinks without consulting her brain. She is also very good at improvising on the spot, a talent that charms not only the two leading men, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, who vie for her affection, but also the five o'clock news audience who like her bum and knickers just fine.Director Sharon Maguire, in her first outing, combines Brit witticisms, slapstick pratfalls, raunchy, sharp and realistic dialogue, and a blatant but inoffensive sentimentality into a romantic comedy that surely has Nora Ephron and Meg Ryan paying close attention. She keeps us guessing about who will get the girl (and who really deserves the girl) with the usual misdirections and misunderstandings characteristic of the genre. There's a little dead time about half way in, and the uncertainty about whether Bridget wants Hugh Grant or Colin Firth is milked a bit overmuch, otherwise this is a nicely paced entertainment sure to chase away a blue afternoon.Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are both very good, and Gemma Jones as Bridget's mother is a charming, dotty sight to see. Bridget's friends are funny as a kind of foil to the tired glamor of Yank TV's ""Friends.""

There are many differences between the book and the movie.  Most of the time this makes me mad on the author's behalf, however, in this case I can totally understand why they made the changes they made.  Just in case you are interested, the character of Mark Darcy is really underdeveloped in the book.  The movie makers must have felt it imperative to draw more on Jane Austen's portrayal of Mr. Darcy to make the character worth having Colin Firth as its actor, because in the book the character of Mark Darcy does not pop up near as many times as it does in the movie.  There are so many things that the movie adds that were never in the book.  Daniel never lies to Bridget about Mark having slept with his fiance.  Daniel and Mark never have that big huge fight scene that occurs near the end of the movie.  Mark never gets a job in America and does not fly out there for any reason.  Mark also never sees her diary and she never runs after him in her underwear during a snow storm.  Bridget's parents never reconcile.  There is a big part of the book that is left out of the movie and that is where Bridget's mother runs off with Julio and a bunch of stolen money, as Julio is a scam artist.  (For those who have seen Pride and Prejudice this scene correlates with Lydia's running off with Wickham)  Mark Darcy is responsible for then tracking them down and clearing up all the mess that they have caused.  (Just like Darcy is the one who saves the day in Austen's version.)The character of Bridget is hailed as an every woman, and I think that this is quite fitting.  Bridget is always getting caught in embarrassing situations that are very hard to watch and read about sometimes.  She is a character whom all women should be able to relate to on some level.  She is the kind of character we can definitely laugh with because she is very witty at times and that makes her into a very likable person.",4,This Movie is More Like Pride and Prejudice than the Book,1014508800,"02 24, 2002",2002,2039,"['movie', 'great', 'made', 'want', 'go', 'get', 'book', 'read', 'highly', 'highly', 'recommend', 'getting', 'book', 'hilarious', 'are', 'many', 'differences', 'book', 'movie', 'Most', 'time', 'mad', 'author', 'behalf', 'however', 'case', 'can', 'totally', 'understand', 'why', 'made', 'changes', 'made', 'Just', 'case', 'are', 'interested', 'character', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'really', 'underdeveloped', 'book', 'movie', 'makers', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'imperative', 'draw', 'more', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'portrayal', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'make', 'character', 'having', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'actor', 'book', 'character', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'not', 'pop', 'up', 'many', 'times', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'movie', 'were', 'never', 'book', 'Daniel', 'never', 'Bridget', 'Mark', 'having', 'slept', 'fiance', 'Daniel', 'Mark', 'never', 'have', 'big', 'huge', 'fight', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'Mark', 'never', 'job', 'America', 'not', 'fly', 'there', 'reason', 'Mark', 'also', 'never', 'diary', 'never', 'underwear', 'snow', 'storm', 'Bridget', 'parents', 'never', 'reconcile', 'big', 'part', 'book', 'left', 'movie', 'where', 'Bridget', 'mother', 'Julio', 'bunch', 'stolen', 'money', 'Julio', 'scam', 'artist', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'scene', 'Lydia', 'running', 'off', 'Wickham', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'responsible', 'then', 'tracking', 'down', 'clearing', 'up', 'mess', 'have', 'caused', 'Just', 'Darcy', 'one', 'who', 'day', 'Austen', 'version', 'character', 'Bridget', 'hailed', 'woman', 'think', 'quite', 'fitting', 'Bridget', 'always', 'getting', 'caught', 'embarrassing', 'situations', 'are', 'very', 'hard', 'watch', 'read', 'sometimes', 'character', 'whom', 'women', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'level', 'kind', 'character', 'can', 'definitely', 'very', 'witty', 'times', 'very', 'likable', 'person']",Bridget Jones's Diary

She thinks that he is too uptight for her so she persues Daniel.  Daniel, who has an appetite for women, is impressed with Bridget.  They go out until she finds out that he is engaged to be married.  What a terrible surprise!  That is the turning point for Bridget to get herself together.  And she does.

And the other characters were just as good portraying Bridget's family and friends.This is a good movie for any single woman.  As single women, there is a great deal of pressure from the marrieds as to why we aren't in a relationship or even married.

Litton,"[2, 3]","From the very beginning, when single thirty-something Bridget Jones begins recounting her experience at her mother's New Year's Day party, I knew I was going to like her. In fact, I completely fell in love with &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary,&quot; a film that not only takes an upbeat approach to being single (what romantic comedy doesn't at some point?), but also employs some of the most witty, sarcastic, and quite refreshing humor I've heard in a movie this year.Renee Zellweger plays Bridget, who works at a publishing firm in London by day, and sits on her couch eating ice cream and drinking wine by night. She dreads her mother's parties as her mother always plays matchmaker, so when she introduces Bridget to Mark Darcy, played by Colin Firth, she feigns interest, and is insulted when Mark makes demeaning comments about her.Setting out to find the right man, she begins a diary, beginning with her New Year's resolution of finding the perfect mate, who, for the time being happens to be her boss, Daniel Cleaver, played by Hugh Grant. For one glorious week, they shag, they laugh, they have dinner, and for a small time, Bridget seems happy. But once she mentions love, it's bye, bye, love, and she's single again, and soon finds herself drawn to Mark, who has a past score to settle with Daniel.The key to making this comedy work is the casting, which is phenomenally bright. Zellweger is the perfect compliment to the portrayal of Bridget's many awkward moments, and she handles the material with such confidence and humor that her character becomes an instant smash. She plays Bridget not as a whiny, waifish martyr whose emotions are on constant overload, but as a full-figured, witty and refreshingly different single girl who looks at being single the way many of us would like to.Hugh Grant proves that he is much better when he's playing the twit, and as Daniel, he's given the perfect chance to act as such. Colin Firth is surprisingly effective as Mark Darcy, employing a subtle wit and charm into his character that becomes engaging and, at times, humorous. Each of these actors share a warm chemistry and delightful exchanges of dialogue with Zellweger, selling us on their romances together while keeping the sap to a minimum.What makes the movie shine is the fact that it strays from the garden variety chick flick agendas and comes out with some very original material. There are inklings of Jane Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; throughout the movie, though most of the material is given a new feel. And instead of being a boring, melodramatic yarn about yuppies in love, it becomes a bright, upbeat comedy about the single life and how one very awkward woman handles hers.The comedy that emanates from the movie is undeniably hilarious, one of the better comedies of this year. Bridget's situations are funny because she handles them with a serious demeanor. The scene involving her trek down the fire poll is a comedic gem (&quot;Excellent. Am national laughingstock. Have bottom the size of Brazil.&quot;), as is Bridget showing up at an outdoor party in a skimpy bunny suit after the plans were changed to formal wear.In the end, though, what really makes this movie shine is its lead actress. Renee Zellweger is a wonderful actress, one that brings a new face and a new meaning to comedy. In &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary,&quot; she takes Bridget's single life and turns it into some of the most funny, highly humorous moments in recent memory. The material is original and refreshing, and makes this romantic comedy a cut above the rest.",4,Charming and full of excellent humor and wit!,1003017600,"10 14, 2001",2001,3576,"['very', 'beginning', 'when', 'single', 'thirty-something', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'recounting', 'experience', 'mother', 'New', 'Year', 'Day', 'party', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'fact', 'completely', 'fell', 'love', 'quot', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'quot', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'upbeat', 'approach', 'being', 'single', 'what', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'point', 'also', 'most', 'witty', 'sarcastic', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'humor', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'movie', 'year.Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Bridget', 'who', 'publishing', 'firm', 'London', 'day', 'sits', 'couch', 'eating', 'ice', 'cream', 'drinking', 'wine', 'night', 'mother', 'parties', 'mother', 'always', 'matchmaker', 'so', 'when', 'Bridget', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'played', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'interest', 'insulted', 'when', 'Mark', 'demeaning', 'comments', 'her.Setting', 'out', 'find', 'right', 'man', 'diary', 'beginning', 'New', 'Year', 'resolution', 'finding', 'perfect', 'mate', 'who', 'time', 'being', 'happens', 'be', 'boss', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'played', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'one', 'glorious', 'week', 'shag', 'laugh', 'have', 'dinner', 'small', 'time', 'Bridget', 'happy', 'once', 'mentions', 'love', 'bye', 'bye', 'love', 'single', 'again', 'soon', 'finds', 'drawn', 'Mark', 'who', 'past', 'score', 'settle', 'Daniel.The', 'key', 'making', 'comedy', 'work', 'casting', 'phenomenally', 'bright', 'Zellweger', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'portrayal', 'Bridget', 'many', 'awkward', 'moments', 'material', 'such', 'confidence', 'humor', 'character', 'instant', 'smash', 'Bridget', 'not', 'whiny', 'waifish', 'martyr', 'emotions', 'are', 'constant', 'overload', 'full-figured', 'witty', 'refreshingly', 'different', 'single', 'girl', 'who', 'being', 'single', 'way', 'many', 'would', 'like', 'to.Hugh', 'Grant', 'much', 'better', 'when', 'playing', 'twit', 'Daniel', 'given', 'perfect', 'chance', 'act', 'such', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'employing', 'subtle', 'wit', 'charm', 'character', 'engaging', 'times', 'humorous', 'actors', 'share', 'warm', 'chemistry', 'delightful', 'exchanges', 'dialogue', 'Zellweger', 'selling', 'romances', 'together', 'keeping', 'sap', 'movie', 'shine', 'fact', 'garden', 'variety', 'chick', 'flick', 'agendas', 'out', 'very', 'original', 'material', 'are', 'inklings', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'quot', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'quot', 'movie', 'most', 'material', 'given', 'new', 'feel', 'instead', 'being', 'boring', 'melodramatic', 'yarn', 'yuppies', 'love', 'bright', 'upbeat', 'comedy', 'single', 'life', 'how', 'one', 'very', 'awkward', 'woman', 'hers.The', 'comedy', 'movie', 'undeniably', 'hilarious', 'one', 'better', 'comedies', 'year', 'Bridget', 'situations', 'are', 'funny', 'serious', 'demeanor', 'scene', 'involving', 'trek', 'down', 'fire', 'poll', 'comedic', 'gem', 'quot', 'Excellent', 'Am', 'national', 'laughingstock', 'Have', 'bottom', 'size', 'Brazil.', 'quot', 'Bridget', 'showing', 'up', 'outdoor', 'party', 'skimpy', 'bunny', 'suit', 'plans', 'were', 'changed', 'formal', 'end', 'though', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'shine', 'lead', 'actress', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'one', 'new', 'face', 'new', 'meaning', 'comedy', 'quot', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'quot', 'Bridget', 'single', 'life', 'most', 'funny', 'highly', 'humorous', 'moments', 'recent', 'memory', 'material', 'original', 'refreshing', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'cut', 'rest']",Bridget Jones's Diary

The hype doesn't do it justice, the diary itself is very different in texture to this movie, and the three main actors are cast  against type. Serious Firth plays a loveable comedy character, honest Hugh plays a bounder, and American Zellwegger plays an English woman. That they all succeed is tribute to their acting abilities as well as the first time director Sharon Maguire.The DVD features a pretty good commentary from her although her voice grates after a while and it would have benefited from a second voice as she leaves lots of gaps. The commentary is made for the American version of the film, but used on both the U.S. and British discs, so it does not tie up in one or two places with what we see on screen. The extras include a large number of deleted scenes, any of which could have stayed in the film, but which Maguire wisely decided to cut for reasons of timing. I think she was right. The film is 1 hour 31 minutes including credits and to have been any longer would have dragged it out.The London scenery looks wonderful, and there are some nice crane shots of London and Bridget's parents' snow-covered village. The jokes in the script mostly hit the mark, and just the right amount of 'diary' is included to warrant the title. There is a great soundtrack, especially in the new songs from Robbie Williams, Gabrielle and Shelby Lynne. I confess to being a little mystified by the suggestion that Zellwegger had piled on weight to play the role as she looks perfectly normal to me, and not at all unattractive. I suspect it's a girl thing! The one complaint I have is that we seem to be living in a part of London where there has been no immigration in the last forty years and where only people from the upper-middle classes live.

536353,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B00003CXT7,D. Mok,"[2, 5]","My sincerest salute to Renee Zellweger.  Not that many actresses would be willing to put on weight, dress in incredibly tacky wardrobe, and play such an utterly uncool, verbally clumsy, constantly humiliated heroine.  Yet here she is, taking on a British accent, getting dressed in &quot;granny knickers&quot;, and tripping on her tongue for the lead role of Bridget Jones -- how refreshing to see a high-profile actress forget vanity for the sake of truth.Bridget Jones's Diary isn't exactly groundbreaking.  It's a fairly standard, acceptably executed romantic comedy, above-average because of the dedicated Zellweger and two absolutely killer love interests, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant.  Nobody plays a ladykiller slimeball quite like Grant, with his devilish smile, wit, and self-deprecating screen presence.  Firth's clean-cut, straight-faced performance gives Grant his foil.  Alas, script-wise, the touches that made the novel (the first one, at least) stand out are largely missing.  The &quot;diary&quot; motif disappears for a good hour in the middle of the movie where plenty of laughs could've been milked (that one use of the subtitle was hilarious); instead, the movie relies on its voice-over, altogether not nearly as fresh a device as the superimposed subtitle.  And it isn't really explained why both men fall head over heels for Bridget because the development of the two love interests is somewhat shallow, so the premise for romance is a little forced.No matter, though.

Though, in the words of most of my male friends, considering this to be a 'chick flick' ...I had thought the movie sounded promising plus, being a life-long fan of Richard Curtis...I'm willing to see almost anything with his talents attached to the screen-writing credits.Perhaps I should begin by simply stating that as far as the lead character Bridget is concerned, American actress Rene Zellweger does a marvelous job portraying the frumpy thirty-something Ms. Jones as a slightly over-weight, hopelessly neurotic, and at times even 'boyfriend obsessed' career girl in London. I could make a point of them not finding a proper British actress to fill the role but I do understand the studio's need to have a 'name' to sell more tickets upon it's release. That being said....while I have not read the novel on which the film is based I must say I was slightly disappointed by the almost sloppy comedic aspect that permeats the entire movie. Don't misunderstand me, I thought the film had it's moments....it just seemed after a short while that I was watchng a film that was simply made up of chaotic scenes with Bridget falling into one crisis or another. Comedy that, for the most part, seemed far too broad and slapstick to be able to stand up under the riguers of an entire film. While some of the lighter moments did hold up well ( I did enjoy the 'panties' scene with the incorrigable Hugh Grant ) I can still remember cringing upon the scene with Bridget sliding down the firefighters pole while there under the premise of conducting a story. A calculated scene that came across as merely 'silly', as opposed to being laugh out loud funny! Plus, attending a function dressed as a Playboy bunny, mistakingly believing it was a costume party, was far too contrived to get a laugh out of this viewer. Simply put, much of what I was seeing just seemed too forced for me to believe that alot of time and effort went into the actual writting of this once promising comedy. And, unfortunately, that is quite possibly the focal point of this less than sterling review....A book that is as highly thought of and universally enjoyed, on both sides of the Atlantic, by so many delighted readers can generally be seen as a 'blessing and a curse' for the studio that brings that well loved novel to the 'big screen.' Stay true to the essence of the lead characters many comedic episodes ( and the spirit of the novel! ) and hopefully you've a captured audience far too enraptured with seeing their heroine on 'larger-than-life' before them. And, ( with any luck! ) many of the films obvious short-comings simply go by unnoticed in some viewers over eager desire's to truly enjoy what they are seeing. My 'gut-feeling' suggests that many film goers had, quite possibly, already had decided that this was a movie that were going to enjoy....almost regardless of what they were viewing on the screen. As long as the producers didn't tamper too much with the original format than I do believe that many ticket holders had subconciously walked into the theatre simply ready to be thoroughly enjoyed by Bridget and Co. A more self-fullfilled prophecy I've yet to see concerning an audience's expectations upon entering a movie theatre. I'm not suggesting that the makers of "" Bridget...."" are being disingenious, it seems as if they are simply being 'creatively lazy' in bringing a product to the screen that asks the audience to cheer on our protagonist simply by virtue of the viewer's loyalty to her in book form.Overall, while there were some enjoyable aspects of the movie ( casting Hugh Grant as Bridget's obnoxious boss and swarmy love interest was a stroke of genius! ) it generally left me with the unsettling feeling that this was a movie that was trying far too hard to be liked. Again, pleasant enough but in the end feeling as though an opportunity had been lost. And that is perhaps the real shame here.....Bridget should be shown as a complete, whole woman, not a silly caricature of who we think she should be. 3.5 Stars",3,Bridget Does Hollywood,1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,4142,"['had', 'actually', 'looked', 'forward', 'release', 'Helen', 'Fieldings', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'big', 'screen', 'Though', 'words', 'most', 'male', 'friends', 'considering', 'be', ""'chick"", 'flick', 'had', 'thought', 'movie', 'sounded', 'promising', 'being', 'life-long', 'fan', 'Richard', 'Curtis', ""'m"", 'willing', 'see', 'almost', 'anything', 'talents', 'attached', 'screen-writing', 'credits.Perhaps', 'should', 'begin', 'simply', 'stating', 'as', 'far', 'lead', 'character', 'Bridget', 'concerned', 'American', 'actress', 'Rene', 'Zellweger', 'marvelous', 'job', 'portraying', 'frumpy', 'thirty-something', 'Ms.', 'Jones', 'slightly', 'over-weight', 'hopelessly', 'neurotic', 'times', 'even', ""'boyfriend"", 'obsessed', 'career', 'girl', 'London', 'could', 'make', 'point', 'not', 'finding', 'proper', 'British', 'actress', 'fill', 'role', 'do', 'understand', 'studio', 'need', 'have', ""'name"", 'sell', 'more', 'tickets', 'release', 'being', 'said', '.while', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'almost', 'sloppy', 'comedic', 'aspect', 'entire', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', 'thought', 'film', 'had', 'moments', '.it', 'just', 'seemed', 'short', 'was', 'watchng', 'film', 'was', 'simply', 'made', 'chaotic', 'scenes', 'Bridget', 'falling', 'one', 'crisis', 'Comedy', 'most', 'part', 'seemed', 'far', 'too', 'broad', 'slapstick', 'be', 'able', 'stand', 'up', 'riguers', 'entire', 'film', 'lighter', 'moments', 'did', 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'did', 'enjoy', ""'panties"", 'scene', 'incorrigable', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'can', 'still', 'remember', 'cringing', 'scene', 'Bridget', 'sliding', 'down', 'firefighters', 'pole', 'premise', 'conducting', 'story', 'calculated', 'scene', 'came', 'merely', ""'silly"", 'opposed', 'being', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'attending', 'function', 'dressed', 'Playboy', 'bunny', 'mistakingly', 'believing', 'was', 'costume', 'party', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'contrived', 'get', 'laugh', 'viewer', 'Simply', 'put', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'seeing', 'just', 'seemed', 'too', 'forced', 'believe', 'alot', 'time', 'effort', 'went', 'actual', 'writting', 'once', 'promising', 'comedy', 'unfortunately', 'quite', 'possibly', 'focal', 'point', 'less', 'sterling', 'review', '.A', 'book', 'highly', 'thought', 'universally', 'enjoyed', 'sides', 'Atlantic', 'so', 'many', 'delighted', 'readers', 'can', 'generally', 'be', 'seen', ""'blessing"", 'curse', 'studio', 'well', 'loved', 'novel', ""'big"", 'screen', 'Stay', 'true', 'essence', 'lead', 'characters', 'many', 'comedic', 'episodes', 'spirit', 'novel', 'hopefully', ""'ve"", 'captured', 'audience', 'far', 'too', 'enraptured', 'seeing', 'heroine', ""'larger-than-life"", 'luck', 'many', 'films', 'obvious', 'short-comings', 'simply', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'viewers', 'eager', 'desire', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', ""'gut-feeling"", 'many', 'film', 'goers', 'had', 'quite', 'possibly', 'already', 'had', 'decided', 'was', 'movie', 'were', 'going', 'enjoy', '.almost', 'regardless', 'what', 'were', 'viewing', 'screen', 'As', 'long', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'tamper', 'too', 'much', 'original', 'format', 'do', 'believe', 'many', 'ticket', 'holders', 'had', 'subconciously', 'walked', 'theatre', 'simply', 'ready', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Bridget', 'Co.', 'A', 'more', 'self-fullfilled', 'prophecy', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see', 'concerning', 'audience', 'expectations', 'entering', 'movie', 'theatre', ""'m"", 'not', 'suggesting', 'makers', 'Bridget', 'are', 'being', 'disingenious', 'are', 'simply', 'being', ""'creatively"", 'lazy', 'bringing', 'product', 'screen', 'audience', 'cheer', 'protagonist', 'simply', 'virtue', 'viewer', 'loyalty', 'book', 'form.Overall', 'were', 'enjoyable', 'aspects', 'movie', 'casting', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Bridget', 'obnoxious', 'boss', 'swarmy', 'love', 'interest', 'was', 'stroke', 'genius', 'generally', 'left', 'unsettling', 'feeling', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'far', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'liked', 'Again', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'end', 'feeling', 'opportunity', 'had', 'been', 'lost', 'perhaps', 'real', 'shame', 'here', '..Bridget', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'complete', 'whole', 'woman', 'not', 'silly', 'caricature', 'who', 'think', 'should', 'be', '3.5', 'Stars']",Bridget Jones's Diary
536355,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B00003CXT7,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 1]","In structural terms, BRIDGET JONES DIARY doesn't have too much relationship to its source; the diary-form is soon abandoned in favor of the basic romantic comic plot. What the film does have, however, is a winning central performance from Renee Zellweger in the eponymous title role; many of her thoughts are heard in voice-over, and director Sharon Maguire has great fun exploring the distance between such thoughts and what really happens in Bridget's life. In many ways she is an idealist, perpetually in search of the ideal boyfriend but doomed to spend her life with lowlifes and/or cads. As Daniel Cleaver, her boss and one-time lover, Hugh Grant is a perfect example of this latter kind of person, the guy who protests love for Bridget on the one hand while trying his best to exploit her credulity on the other. The film also brings out the story's Austenian echoes; Colin Firth is wonderfully standoffish as Mark Darcy, but he understand his true nature from the way he stares at Bridget, even though he moves scarcely a facial muscle. Proud of his public image as a hotshot lawyer, he finds it difficult, if not impossible to acknowledge his true feelings - at least until the climactic fight sequence with Cleaver. BRIDGET JONES DIARY also contains at least two memorable cameos from Gemma Jones as Bridget's mother - whose antics put her daughter to shame - and Paul Brooke as Mr. Fitzberbert (or Tits Pervert as Bridget calls him), Cleaver's snobbish sidekick.

Okay, she smokes and drinks too much and she has a habit of saying what's on her mind before she can edit her remarks. Also, a lot is made of her size. Yet, in her role, she is definitely more attractive and fit than most thirty-something-year-old single female office workers. But it is her spirit, her spunk, and sincerity that makes her attractive enough to realistically have Mark Darcy and Daniel Cleaver fighting over her affections.-----> THE CAST &lt;-----Renee Zellweger - Bridget JonesColin Firth - Mark DarcyHugh Grant - Daniel CleaverGemma Jones - Bridget's MumJim Broadbent - Bridget's DadEmbeth Davidtz - Natasha'BRIDGET JONE'S DAIRY' HAS A SIMPLE BUT ELEGANT PLOT {plot spoilers below}Our heroine, Ms. Bridget Jones is a 32-year-old, single, working woman who has just decided it is time to get serious about avoiding becoming a spinster. She's a young woman who smokes, drinks, and eats all seemingly to excess as she returns home for her parents' Christmas party. Upon arrival, she is informed that her mom would like to set her up with a recently-divorced son of one of their long-time neighbors. Yes, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) is the visiting neighbors' son.Sadly, Mark not only seems disinterested, but spews numerous insults about Bridget while she is within earshot. Well, she didn't like him anyway, and for the new year she has decided to start a diary and lose weight, maybe. Back at the office, the rejected Bridget falls for the office cad, her boss Daniel Cleaver {Hugh Grant), a wanna-be Romeo who sends her lewd e-mails that lead to a dinner date. Daniel does tell Bridget that he and Mark went to Cambridge together and that Mark had stolen his fianc'e and broke his heart. Of course, Daniel the cad is lying, but that does come out later when it matters. When Bridget then finds Daniel fooling around with an American colleague, she decides a change of scenery is needed and takes a job as a TV reporter on an exploitationist TV show.At her own birthday party, for which she is cooking and destroying the dinner, Mark shows up again and now expresses his affection for her. Almost simultaneously, cad Daniel pops in and insists he wants Bridget back. Then, out in the street and in a seemingly gay eating establishment, the two fight over who deserves her affections the most. Though Mark was the clear winner, it was not until Bridget learned that Daniel had really stolen Mark's wife and the broken heart was Mark's that Mark and Bridget really connected in a meaningful way. This new info seemed to tip the balance in Mark Darcy's favor. Though there were still to be a few tense Bridget moments, such as when Mark read Bridget's diary and discovered that she had hated him, the two were destined to begin a lasting and meaningful relationship and to live happily ever after, or so we were expecting before they came out with a sequel.",5,A DIFFERENT KIND OF ROMANTIC COMEDY,1162512000,"11 3, 2006",2006,3042,"['-*', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'really', 'something', 'else', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'unique', 'woman', 'worthy', 'men', 'seem', 'slow', 'recognize', 'rather', 'odd', 'bird', 'charm', 'Okay', 'drinks', 'too', 'much', 'habit', 'saying', 'what', 'mind', 'can', 'edit', 'remarks', 'Also', 'lot', 'made', 'size', 'role', 'definitely', 'more', 'attractive', 'fit', 'most', 'thirty-something-year-old', 'single', 'female', 'office', 'workers', 'spirit', 'spunk', 'sincerity', 'attractive', 'enough', 'realistically', 'have', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'fighting', 'affections.', 'THE', 'CAST', 'lt', '-Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Bridget', 'JonesColin', 'Firth', 'Mark', 'DarcyHugh', 'Grant', 'Daniel', 'CleaverGemma', 'Jones', 'Bridget', 'MumJim', 'Broadbent', 'Bridget', 'DadEmbeth', 'Davidtz', ""Natasha'BRIDGET"", 'JONE', 'DAIRY', 'HAS', 'A', 'SIMPLE', 'BUT', 'ELEGANT', 'PLOT', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'heroine', 'Ms.', 'Bridget', 'Jones', '32-year-old', 'single', 'working', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'decided', 'time', 'get', 'serious', 'avoiding', 'becoming', 'spinster', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'drinks', 'seemingly', 'excess', 'home', 'parents', 'Christmas', 'party', 'arrival', 'informed', 'mom', 'would', 'like', 'set', 'up', 'recently-divorced', 'son', 'one', 'long-time', 'neighbors', 'Yes', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'visiting', 'neighbors', 'son.Sadly', 'Mark', 'not', 'only', 'disinterested', 'numerous', 'insults', 'Bridget', 'earshot', 'Well', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'anyway', 'new', 'year', 'decided', 'start', 'diary', 'lose', 'weight', 'maybe', 'Back', 'office', 'rejected', 'Bridget', 'office', 'cad', 'boss', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'wanna-be', 'Romeo', 'who', 'lewd', 'e-mails', 'lead', 'dinner', 'date', 'Daniel', 'tell', 'Bridget', 'Mark', 'went', 'Cambridge', 'together', 'Mark', 'had', 'stolen', 'fianc', 'e', 'broke', 'heart', 'course', 'Daniel', 'cad', 'lying', 'come', 'out', 'later', 'when', 'When', 'Bridget', 'then', 'Daniel', 'fooling', 'around', 'American', 'colleague', 'change', 'scenery', 'needed', 'job', 'TV', 'reporter', 'exploitationist', 'TV', 'show.At', 'own', 'birthday', 'party', 'cooking', 'destroying', 'dinner', 'Mark', 'up', 'again', 'now', 'affection', 'Almost', 'simultaneously', 'cad', 'Daniel', 'Bridget', 'back', 'Then', 'out', 'street', 'seemingly', 'gay', 'eating', 'establishment', 'two', 'fight', 'who', 'affections', 'most', 'Mark', 'was', 'clear', 'winner', 'was', 'not', 'Bridget', 'learned', 'Daniel', 'had', 'really', 'stolen', 'Mark', 'wife', 'broken', 'heart', 'was', 'Mark', 'Mark', 'Bridget', 'really', 'connected', 'meaningful', 'way', 'new', 'info', 'seemed', 'tip', 'balance', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'favor', 'were', 'still', 'be', 'few', 'tense', 'Bridget', 'moments', 'such', 'when', 'Mark', 'read', 'Bridget', 'diary', 'discovered', 'had', 'hated', 'two', 'were', 'destined', 'begin', 'lasting', 'meaningful', 'relationship', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'so', 'were', 'expecting', 'came', 'out', 'sequel']",Bridget Jones's Diary

536361,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B00003CXT7,Elisabeth,"[2, 4]","**REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**There were several messages in this movie that bothered me.  For instance, it bothered me that singles are treated like they have a disease desperate for a cure.  Sure, Bridget acts bothered, too, when everyone looks down on her for being single...but Bridget looks down on singles herself, even calling herself a spinster.It bothered me that, throughout this movie, Bridget is treated like a sex object.  From her first boss commenting on her short skirt, to her second boss wanting her to do a news report in a short skirt, to her ""uncle"" squeezing her butt, to her mom wanting to mascerade her in front of eligible men.  I saw this treatment as demeaning, but Bridget shakes it off as normal.It bothered me that infidelity is treated so lightly in this movie.  We have Bridget's self-absorbed mom who cheats on her husband and seems indifferent to his suffering...yet, at the end, the husband just jokes it off and takes her back.  The message this sends is that infidelity is really no big deal.  Just a harmless little fling.We have Mark Darcy who acts like a wounded puppy being bossed around by his girlfriend, so we're supposed to root for him to cheat on her with Bridget.  But no one forced Mark to stay with his girlfriend.  If he was so miserable, why did he not only stay with his girlfriend, but get engaged to her?  If he's supposed to be an honorable man and a catch, then why didn't he do the honorable thing and break up with his girlfriend FIRST before confessing to Bridget that he likes her just as she is?It also bothered me how clueless Bridget was.  I mean, her boss makes blatantly inappropriate comments to her and yet, she finds it endearing?  I guess having such an inappropriately vocal mother herself, she probably thought inappropriateness was quite normal.But what really bothered me is that Bridget is portrayed as ditzy...and this ditziness is what attracks two men in her life.  This sends the message that men really do like dumb blondes.Normally, a movie having so much wrong with it would warrant a 2-star or even 1-star rating.

This one does it, and does it very well.A lot of bad things could have been done to this film.  They could have tried to make her more likeable by cutting down on the vices.  They could have made her slimmer.  Or, with reference to the recent &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, they could have chucked England all together and put it in the U.S..But they recognized that somehow Bridget is somehow likeable IN SPITE OF the mess her personal life is in, and maybe because of it.  So they left it in England, and kept all the vices.  And while Kate Winslett seemed the logical choice for the role, I thought it was a big gamble to get Texan Renee' Zellweger plumped up.  The gamble paid off.One thing the movie adds that wasn't apparent in the book (nor could it be) was with the Mark Darcy part.  It would seem that he is secretly attracted to her early in the story.

536375,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXT7,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 4]","This film is another excellent showcase for the talents of Rene Zellweger.  It is a fairly common occurrence for British actors to play American characters with varying degrees of success in duplicating an American accent.  It is almost unheard of for an American to play a British character, and when it does happen the accent is almost always awful.  Zellweger nails both the accent and the demeanor of the quintessential middle class English girl and is absolutely charming in the role.The screenplay is an adaptation of Helen Fielding's novel of the same name that follows the single life of everywoman Bridget through the trials and tribulations of being a singleton.  Fielding unabashedly admitted in interviews that the original story was borrowed from Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"", going so far as to name one of the main characters Darcy (Colin Firth), the identical name of the corresponding character in Austen's novel.  To complete the bizarre crossbreeding, Firth played Darcy in the BBC production of P&amp;P just before being cast in this role.Fielding's screenplay is full of the ironic and droll humor that makes English comedy unique.  Bridget is written as such an adorable ditz that you can't help loving her, especially with Zellweger playing the role.  First time director Sharon Maguire does a bang up job of keeping the silliness moving at a rapid fire pace.Zellweger is perfect for this role and must be commended for expanding her horizons (in all senses of the word).  She packed a great deal of weight onto her normally svelte frame to properly depict Bridget's weight problem.  She then boldly allowed herself to be photographed in various skimpy outfits where flab burst forth from every seam.  Even more important than her excellent English accent is her comic ability to make the most of every peculiar situation with matter-of-factness so natural it is hard to believe that she didn't grow up in England.Zellweger totally eclipses her male leads in energy, comedic ability and charm.  The normally likeable and bumbling Hugh Grant is sorely miscast as the jerk.  Grant's strength is his sincerity and his character doesn't possess any, leaving him adrift in his ability to interpret the role.  Firth, who has excellent comedic and dramatic skills, is really wasted in a role that mostly sees him leering dourly at Bridget for two thirds of the film.

I found the movie on our DVD shelves and it must have been there by the action of my separated wife. I have trouble watching sappy romance movies, and she loves them. In any case, Zellweger was the main character (Bridget) and played an unmarried mid-thirties woman who was becoming ever more apprehensive about her situation. Her two off - again, on-again love interests were Hugh Grant (a dork hampered with a dour personality), who she met at one of her mother's social gatherings, and Colin Firth (Mr. Smooth)  who was her supervisor at the office where she worked. Yaawwwnnnn! Neither didn't seem to go very well and neither was convincing. She hated Grant, so Firth turned out to be first in line and all was going well until he was discovered playing around with a high-powered lawyer. Next came Grant. Oh yes, somewhere along the line, in a non-convincing little side plot, her mother gave her father the boot for a seedy on-screen television salesman. Alas, then Grant seemed to have problems with the same lawyer. Ho-hum. Life in London is so complicated.The movie was well produced and flowed along at a nice rate. The photography and settings were well done. The Acting was fairly good. However, all this just couldn't overcome the dreadful script.

536380,A1RJJ56MBJMX87,B00003CXT7,Gavin Wilson,"[4, 5]","Bridget Jones Diary evolved from a newspaper column, became a book and then almost simultaneously became a film and a second book.  While Helen Fielding locked herself in an LA hotel room penning 'The Edge of Reason', accomplished screenwriters Richard Curtis (of NOTTING HILL and BLACKADDER fame) and Andrew Davies (PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, VERY PECULIAR PRACTICE etc) hacked about at the first Bridget Jones novel to create the screenplay for this movie.  Fielding had no track record on screenplays, so it was understandable that an experienced professional should be drafted in.  But two??  The end result is something reasonably satisfying, but as a romance it's not as convincing as say, NOTTING HILL, and as a comedy, it's not as funny as FOUR WEDDINGS.  There just aren't enough top-quality jokes spread about the movie -- the writers don't make the most of Bridget's two opportunities to deliver really bad speeches, for example.  I get the sense that if Richard Curtis had been given total authorial control over the screenplay, he would have put more effort into it.This DVD goes nowhere to explain the resentment Fielding felt about having the two screenwriters brought in.  She is tight-lipped in the interview on the DVD, but the questioning is undemanding.  Fielding has deliberately set the screenwriters an insoluble task for THE EDGE OF REASON, because in that book Bridget Jones goes to Italy to interview Colin Firth as Colin Firth.As for the other extras on the DVD, it's clear that the editor did a good job: the right deleted scenes were left out of the movie, even if one or two contained a greater sense of the diary feel of the original book.When I originally saw this at the cinema, the audience, who seemed to be 90% female, enjoyed this enormously.  My main criticism of the plot was that Bridget doesn't provide Darcy with sufficient grounds for falling in love with her.  Bridget seems to win largely through comparison with Darcy's snooty lawyer girlfriend.  We see big leaps in the affection Darcy has for Bridget, and it would have been nice to have had a couple more scenes to smooth out those leaps.Contrary to all my expectation, Renee Zellweger gives an excellent portrayal of Bridget.  Her English accent is flawless, and she only gives her American roots away by occasionally looking too directly into her parents' eyes.I liked it.

Oh, what the hey, I can't help but be overly enthusiastic about such a warm,funny, cute, witty,and just absolutely adorable, feel-good movie as Bridget Jone's Diary!  I have but a handful of ""favorite comedies"" that I  never grow tired of watching (and seem to find funnier with each successive viewing) and Bridgette is now one of the handful - perhaps she's even on the top of the pile!This is one of those movies you most definitely should buy, simply because it makes you happy to watch it.  No matter how depressed or cranky you might be, this movie is like the best therapy around!  It will put you in a good mood - I guarrantee!  Why?  First of all, it's funny!  Very, very funny; funny in a cute, silly sort of way, not a tacky, tasteless, Scary Movie sort of way. This is a movie that's just bursting with fantastically silly dialogue - and the best dialogues are the ones going on right inside Bridgette's own head!  It all boils down to something people tend to forget about:  The Writing!  And the writing for this movie is excellent!Okay, next: the character of Bridgette Jones; played to perfection by Renee Zellwinger (who, by the way, I was not very crazy about before this movie, but this woman can really do comedy and her English accent is dead-on!  Plus, she's not afraid to look bad; very commendable for an actress).  The character is adorable!  She's so humble and lovable - you will indeed fall in love with her.  You just can't help it!  Unfortunately, for her, she falls in love with Hugh Grant's character in the movie, who plays her ""playboy of a boss""!  And as everyone knows, Hugh Grant is fantastic at playing those rakish ""bad boy types""!So the acting is good; the writing is good; and never once does it lose steam or become boring. And here's another thing; this movie has depth.  It's not your typical slap-stick just going for the humor comedy.  It's not some boring old cliche of a romance, either.  No, it's much, much more.  It's funny; yes, but it also has heart and soul!  Then ending, I promise you, will raise your endorphin levels to new heights!What's the movie about?  Well, it's about a single thirty-something woman living in London who drinks too much, can't seem to meet the ""right sort of men"", and basically feels her life is a mess. So, on New Year's, she decides to start keeping a diary, lose some weight, cut out the drinking; and basically get her life back on track.  Like most resolutions, though, they seem to get swept down the toilet!Is this a chick flick?  I suppose some people would say yes (possibly men)!  But honestly, my husband liked this movie, too.

536387,A1Y1YRO74S6ELA,B00003CXT7,"GreatWriterChrisJames ""ChrisJames""","[1, 1]","Both critics and audiences loved Bridget Jones diary and there are variety of reasons why:Bridget Jones character ups and downs resembles both men and women in their early 30's:Both men and women at this age, are contemplatingtheir status in life.Their bummed out because they haven't met that  special someone, or they are bummed out, because throughout their life, they have met only losers  who are wasting their time  (which I very familiar with, except in my case, I've met mostly shallow women while the nice, beautiful girls are all taken.)However, it's just romantic life that is  troubling people like Bridget Jones, contemplation about their careers and family are coming toward  the forefront of their life.Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger)  is a British publishing assistant  who works for a publishing agency. She has a poor excuse of a lady boss and a male boss.The whole film is narrated through the young, and  witty and vivacious eyes of Bridget Jones.  We learn how she feels about many people in her life, and we get to know Bridget on a very personal level, which is one of the reasons the film is highly acclaimed so much.Anyhow, Bridget's male is Daniel Cleaver (played  as brilliant ridiculous as ever by Hugh Grant).  Ever since Mr. Grant made the fatal mistake of  picking up a prostitute, he's been ridiculed  (rightly so ) by the media, but he's also benefited  from it. He's played degenerate, characters for mostof his career, and the audience loves it.Daniel, comes across as a very sly and romantic, and often blatanly horny boss, who wants Bridget, even going as far as sending her, really provocative emails.Bridget (she has a young nieve mind) falls for  Daniel's (ahem) charms and starts seeing him,unbeknowst to Bridget what kind of man, Daniel.  This changes though, when Bridget meets a familycalled Mark Darcy (Colin Firth)  , who constantly seems to be meeting  Bridget at family gatherings.Bridget and Mark Darcy seem to have a hate relationship.  He himself is rude, arrogant, and ridiculous attimes.However, it's revealed that Mark also likes Bridget, and Bridget has the tough decision ofdeciding which man to really give her heart.  As you can see the story is very real to the lives  of real women both in Britain and US.Unfortunanetly though, once a woman makes the decision that Bridget makes, she is pretty muchstuck with her decision for most of her life.The Dvd comes loaded with a bunch of extra features, in fact, if you haven't seen the movie,I extremely encourage to watch the dvd and not the  vhs, since the DVD will give so many great itemsto watch including:* 2 music videos for the DVD*Deleted Scenes!!!!* Special Commentary*Trailers*Actual columns written by the real Bridget Jonesand much more!!",5,Why Renee Zellweger is such a great  actress,1109289600,"02 25, 2005",2005,2754,"['critics', 'audiences', 'loved', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'diary', 'are', 'variety', 'reasons', 'why', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'character', 'ups', 'downs', 'resembles', 'men', 'women', 'early', '30', 'men', 'women', 'age', 'are', 'contemplatingtheir', 'status', 'life.Their', 'bummed', 'out', 'have', ""n't"", 'met', 'special', 'someone', 'are', 'bummed', 'out', 'life', 'have', 'met', 'only', 'losers', 'who', 'are', 'wasting', 'time', 'very', 'familiar', 'case', ""'ve"", 'met', 'mostly', 'shallow', 'women', 'nice', 'beautiful', 'girls', 'are', 'taken', 'However', 'just', 'romantic', 'life', 'troubling', 'people', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'contemplation', 'careers', 'family', 'are', 'coming', 'forefront', 'life.Bridget', 'Jones', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'British', 'publishing', 'assistant', 'who', 'publishing', 'agency', 'poor', 'excuse', 'lady', 'boss', 'male', 'boss.The', 'whole', 'film', 'narrated', 'young', 'witty', 'vivacious', 'eyes', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'learn', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'life', 'get', 'know', 'Bridget', 'very', 'personal', 'level', 'one', 'reasons', 'film', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'so', 'much.Anyhow', 'Bridget', 'male', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'played', 'brilliant', 'ridiculous', 'ever', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Ever', 'Mr.', 'Grant', 'made', 'fatal', 'mistake', 'picking', 'up', 'prostitute', 'been', 'ridiculed', 'rightly', 'so', 'media', 'also', 'benefited', 'played', 'degenerate', 'characters', 'mostof', 'career', 'audience', 'it.Daniel', 'across', 'very', 'sly', 'romantic', 'often', 'blatanly', 'horny', 'boss', 'who', 'Bridget', 'even', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'sending', 'really', 'provocative', 'emails.Bridget', 'young', 'nieve', 'mind', 'Daniel', 'ahem', 'charms', 'starts', 'seeing', 'unbeknowst', 'Bridget', 'what', 'kind', 'man', 'Daniel', 'though', 'when', 'Bridget', 'familycalled', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'who', 'constantly', 'be', 'meeting', 'Bridget', 'family', 'gatherings.Bridget', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'seem', 'have', 'hate', 'relationship', 'rude', 'arrogant', 'ridiculous', 'attimes.However', 'revealed', 'Mark', 'also', 'Bridget', 'Bridget', 'tough', 'decision', 'ofdeciding', 'man', 'really', 'give', 'heart', 'can', 'see', 'story', 'very', 'real', 'lives', 'real', 'women', 'Britain', 'US.Unfortunanetly', 'once', 'woman', 'decision', 'Bridget', 'pretty', 'muchstuck', 'decision', 'most', 'life.The', 'Dvd', 'loaded', 'bunch', 'extra', 'features', 'fact', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'extremely', 'encourage', 'watch', 'dvd', 'not', 'vhs', 'DVD', 'will', 'give', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'itemsto', 'watch', 'including', '*', '2', 'music', 'videos', 'DVD*Deleted', 'Scenes', '*', 'Special', 'Commentary*Trailers*Actual', 'columns', 'written', 'real', 'Bridget', 'Jonesand', 'much', 'more']",Bridget Jones's Diary

Teysko ""heatherteyskodotcom""","[3, 3]","This movie will always be a classic for single women because it's a fairly accurate reflection of life for a demographic of women that is growing with our generation. I don't have the statistics, but I don't think there has ever been a time where so many young women have delayed marriage for so long (for whatever reasons) and have high incomes, live alone without roommates, rely on their friends as family, and date so freely. We get to learn about Bridget's life through her diary, in which she is unabashedly honest.I lived this life when I lived in London, and so much of this movie rang true to my life. Renee Zellweger's accent is spot on, and Bridget is so loveable because she is so open and honest about her flaws. She has the same struggles and fears that we all do - being afraid that she'll die alone and be eaten by dogs because no one will notice, the fact that she needs to wear granny-panties to hide the lumps under her tight dress, but she also shows us that there is MORE to a woman than her romantic relationship status (Bridget writes the same sort of self-improvement lists that my friends and I all did - we would resolve to read intelligent books and magazines, go to museums, eat more vegetables and stop drinking/smoking/partying).And sometimes, when you're not even looking for it, love pops up at the last place you'd ever expect it.I hope that someday I have a daughter and can watch this movie with her when she's old enough. Highly recommended.The script isn't as good as the book, but it fits the essense of the book into two hours, which is about as good as you can do. The cast is amazing from beginning to end. The production is great.

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[1, 2]","IN A PHRASE: BRIDGET JONES' DIARY IS A CLEVER ROMANTIC COMEDY which has indeed become an increasingly rare bird!WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?: Renee Zellweger is Bridget Jones & she's something else!Bridget Jones is a unique woman, though worthy men seem slow to recognize this rather odd bird's charm. Okay, she smokes and drinks too much and she has a habit of saying what's on her mind before she can edit her remarks. Also, a lot is made of her size. Yet, in her role, she is definitely more attractive and fit than most thirty-something-year-old single female office workers. But it is her spirit, her spunk, and sincerity that makes her attractive enough to realistically have Mark Darcy and Daniel Cleaver fighting over her affections.----- THE ACTORS -Renee Zellweger - Bridget JonesColin Firth - Mark DarcyHugh Grant - Daniel CleaverGemma Jones - Bridget's MumJim Broadbent - Bridget's DadEmbeth Davidtz - NatashaIT IS A SIMPLE BUT ELEGANT PLOT [warning - contains plot spoilers below]Bridget is a 32-year-old, single, working woman who has just decided it is time to get serious about avoiding becoming a spinster. She's a young woman who smokes, drinks, and eats all seemingly to excess as she returns home for her parents' Christmas party. Upon arrival, she is informed that her mom would like to set her up with a recently-divorced son of one of their long-time neighbors. Yes, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) is the visiting neighbors' son.Sadly, Mark not only seems disinterested, but spews numerous insults about Bridget while she is within earshot. Well, she didn't like him anyway, and for the new year she has decided to start a diary and lose weight, maybe. Back at the office, the rejected Bridget falls for the office cad, her boss Daniel Cleaver {Hugh Grant), a wanna-be Romeo who sends her lewd e-mails that lead to a dinner date. Daniel does tell Bridget that he and Mark went to Cambridge together and that Mark had stolen his fianc&eacute;e and broke his heart. Of course, Daniel the cad is lying, but that does come out later when it matters. When Bridget then finds Daniel fooling around with an American colleague, she decides a change of scenery is needed and takes a job as a TV reporter on an exploitationist TV show.At her own birthday party, for which she is cooking and destroying the dinner, Mark shows up again and now expresses his affection for her. Almost simultaneously, cad Daniel pops in and insists he wants Bridget back. Then, out in the street and in a seemingly gay eating establishment, the two fight over who deserves her affections the most. Though Mark was the clear winner, it was not until Bridget learned that Daniel had really stolen Mark's wife and the broken heart was Mark's that Mark and Bridget really connected in a meaningful way. This new info seemed to tip the balance in Mark Darcy's favor.

Renee Zellweger, who has been lauded in the press for gaining twenty pounds to play Bridget, looks a lot more normal than she does at her normal malnourished weight. In, fact it surprised me that this movie was not panned by critics for portraying a woman who is slightly more rounded than is the hollywood norm, as overweight.Hugh Grant plays a corporate cad who seduces Ms.Jones, then ruins her illusion of love with a super model esque american. Colin Firth has all the acting range of a corpse with severe rigor mortis, but with a tad less charm. This faux love triangleis played out at a tepid pace, only to conclude with an ending that is so far-fetched, so inane, that it mad me want to scream.The whiny, complaining, life-is-so-hard tone of the film wore thin after 10 minutes.

536400,A1SCJWCMQ3W3KK,B00003CXT7,Irishgal,"[5, 5]","In 1995, the Jane Austen classic ""Pride and Prejudice"" was aired as a BBC miniseries - and women all over Britain (and a year later, the US) fell in love with actor Colin Firth's portrayal of the enigmatic Mr. Darcy. Author Helen Fielding was one of those women, and in an homage to the classic novel (not to mention Firth's performance), she began writing a series of newspaper columns modernizing the classic tale.Bridget Jones, a modern-day Elizabeth Bennett, is a thirty-something living in London. In January, Bridget decides to begin a diary to reveal who she really is. She vows to lose weight, find a sensible boyfriend, and prove that she is a dedicated woman with inner poise. What follows is a hilarious and all-too-true journey into Bridget's life over the next twelve months.Like many best-selling novels, ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" has become a movie, and while some specific scenes have changed, the plot line stays the same in a fantastic adaptation of Helen Fielding's beloved creation. Renee Zellweger is perfectly cast as Bridget, and she provides a realistic and brilliant interpretation of the heroine. Hugh Grant shows his charm and wit as Daniel Cleaver, the cad who vies for Bridget's affections (a la Austen's character of Wickham). And, in a bit of a reprisal of his BBC role, Colin Firth plays Mark Darcy (a tribute to ""Pride and Prejudice""'s Mr. Darcy), a friend of Bridget's who seems so wrong for her he might actually be Mr. Right.With first time director Sharon Maguire (the real-life inspiration for Fielding's character of Sharon) leading the team of writers Richard Curtis (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Love Actually"") and Fielding herself, the beloved Bridget Jones emerges from the page to the screen in a hilarious film you will want to watch over and over again.",5,Fantastic Adaptation,1090454400,"07 22, 2004",2004,1804,"['1995', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'classic', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'was', 'aired', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'women', 'Britain', 'year', 'later', 'US', 'fell', 'love', 'actor', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'portrayal', 'enigmatic', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Author', 'Helen', 'Fielding', 'was', 'one', 'women', 'homage', 'classic', 'novel', 'not', 'mention', 'Firth', 'performance', 'began', 'writing', 'series', 'newspaper', 'columns', 'modernizing', 'classic', 'tale.Bridget', 'Jones', 'modern-day', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennett', 'thirty-something', 'living', 'London', 'January', 'Bridget', 'begin', 'diary', 'reveal', 'who', 'really', 'lose', 'weight', 'find', 'sensible', 'boyfriend', 'prove', 'dedicated', 'woman', 'inner', 'poise', 'What', 'hilarious', 'all-too-true', 'journey', 'Bridget', 'life', 'next', 'twelve', 'months.Like', 'many', 'best-selling', 'novels', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'become', 'movie', 'specific', 'scenes', 'have', 'changed', 'plot', 'line', 'same', 'fantastic', 'adaptation', 'Helen', 'Fielding', 'beloved', 'creation', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Bridget', 'realistic', 'brilliant', 'interpretation', 'heroine', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'charm', 'wit', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'cad', 'who', 'Bridget', 'affections', 'la', 'Austen', 'character', 'Wickham', 'bit', 'reprisal', 'BBC', 'role', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'tribute', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'friend', 'Bridget', 'who', 'so', 'wrong', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'Mr.', 'Right.With', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Sharon', 'Maguire', 'real-life', 'inspiration', 'Fielding', 'character', 'Sharon', 'leading', 'team', 'writers', 'Richard', 'Curtis', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'Love', 'Actually', 'Fielding', 'beloved', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'page', 'screen', 'hilarious', 'film', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'over', 'again']",Bridget Jones's Diary
536401,A3LP5RUMWG7GQ0,B00003CXT7,I. Westray,"[10, 15]","I pushed the eject button on this DVD wondering &quot;Why on earth would anyone, leave alone a stand-in for Mr. Darcy, want to be with Bridget?Don't get me wrong, I understand the idea: the main character is lovable despite her flaws, and for once it isn't a Cinderella story about becoming beautiful (read: skinny) when you thought you weren't. She drinks, she smokes, she's kind of a bumbler socially, but she can still be happy, right? She can still find true love. That's a likable premise.Except... um... why were we supposed to like this woman again?Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are really fun in this movie. Grant seems to relish his role as the scoundrel, and man, the guy has wonderful comic timing. Colin Firth basically is meant to be Pride and Prejudice's Mr. Darcy -- the character's name is Mark Darcy, and Firth played Darcy in the BBC miniseries version of that book -- but instead of being proud or disdainful, it seems as if the direction might have been &quot;do your best to bore the audience.&quot; He's a bland, bland guy, Mark Darcy. Firth works through that okay, he's a flawless actor and he can make his limp noodle of a character stand up -- but even he can't rescue the idea that his character would fall in love with Ms. Jones. Why would he do THAT?This movie's working really hard to make Bridget adorable, to make her haplessness touching. It didn't work for me. Bridget's an &quot;event magnet&quot;; she's the sort of person things are always happening &quot;to&quot; mainly because of how oblivious she is to everything outside her own head. She's self-involved, and things just sort of keep knocking over when she accidentally stumbles into them. The lovable quality just didn't outweigh the obnoxious one. She's really kind of a jerk in several spots.It isn't Renee Zellweger's fault, she's basically as adorable as anyone going. It's the writing and the directing. I mean, c'mon -- the character goes to a &quot;tarts and vicars&quot; costume wearing a playboy bunny costume. When she realizes it isn't really a costumer, she continues to wear her outfit, complete with bunny ears, for the rest of the party and (apparently) all the way home to her flat in London. Hours after her humiliation, she hasn't taken the ears off? That's pretty DANG contrived. Jack Tripper could have stumbled in from &quot;Three's Company&quot; at any moment, making lovey eyes at Bridget, and you wouldn't have blinked.This struck me as just another poor, soundtrack-pushing adaptation of a pretty good pop novel. The DVD includes some of the original &quot;Diary&quot; entries as an added feature, and they give you the sense of a bright-enough person who's being endearingly self-deprecating in her journal.

536409,AWA0CA9AYL5YQ,B00003CXT7,Jennifer Litchfield,"[1, 1]","Bridget Jones's Diary is a surprisingly good movie. Detractors who deride it for its admittedly minimalist plot miss the point - this is a film that shows life without the layers of artificiality favoured by directors (resulting in movies somehow removed from the realm of the everyday in which us mere mortals dwell). Life is frequently aimless and trivial; and therein lies the movie's attraction. Notwithstanding of course that this is a very funny and highly original comedy.Bridget (played with considerable aplomb by Renee Zellweger) belongs to the ranks of that modern phenomenon - the over-30, unmarried career woman. Just when it seems Bridget may be destined for terminal spinster-hood, two opposing forces enter her life - charming cad Daniel, and uptight (but very sexy) lawyer Mark. Which of the two is her Mr. Right? And why does everyone insist on asking that question detested by all singletons - ""How's your love life going?"" The movie's conclusion is predictable, and although any other ending would leave the audience feeling cheated, it does seem somewhat tame and ultimately unsatisfying.The film encourages the viewer both to get involved with Bridget emotionally and to laugh at her at the same time. Perhaps the best joke is the milieu inhabited by her parents - where the mini-gherkin is the height of sophistication, and 60-year-olds throw garden parties with such alarming themes as 'tarts and vicars'. Bridget is certainly no social butterfly, and whilst we cringe at her public embarrassments (notably her TV report involving a fireman's pole and a bottom the size of Brazil), we triumph with her when she manages to turn a bad situation to her advantage. Maybe we can recognise a little bit of Bridget Jones in all of us.",4,"""Am national laughing stock.

I resisted it I admit, thinking I wouldn't relate to the plump heroine coping with loveless sex, dueling suitors and haughty English folk.  Yet, not only does the movie sparkle in unexpected, laugh-riot moments, Renee Zellweger proves yet again what a stunning actress she's become.  In the title role, she's silly and coy, at once vapid and brilliant, a heroine for our generation.  Hugh Grant is slimy-sleazy as her boss, a real departure from his ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" Jimmy STewart-ish character.  And, Colin Firth excels as an unlikable suitor who in the end hooks Bridget with intelligence, heroism and a deep warmth that is rarely allowed to shine (ultimately it's Bridget who brings him out of his shell, while exchanging her own for a newer model!)Ever since ""Jerry MaGuire"" made her a star, Zellweger was dazzled in on screen roles like ""Nurse Betty"" and ""One True Thing.""  This is an actress who is able to fully expose her character - warts and all.  Where other actresses might shy away from brash, bold characters, Zellweger embraces them, and in the process, the audience falls in love.  She has the sort of face that tells stories with small, seemingly unimportant facial expressions.  A raised eyebrow here, a pursed lip there, she's able to convey layers of emotional context and depth that very few of her contemporaries can ever hope to achieve.  Her spellbinding work opposite Meryl Streep in ""One True Thing"" is proof positive this star is here to stay - and deserves attention as quite possibly the best actress of today;s generation.  Very few actresses could ever hope to shine opposite the legendary Streep, but Zellweger does that and more.  In that film, and this one, she delivers a fully realized character, infusing Bridget with wit, charm, charisma, and more than anything - REALNESS.  Ultimately, that's the best thing about this movie - the multiple levels Zellweger manages to pull off will allow even men to see parts of themselves through Bridget's eyes.  Warm, lighthearted, but filled with detail and myriad emotions, ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" is a winner!  Let's hope Zellweger finally cops an Oscar nomination (which she's deserved for other roles in ""McGuire"", ""One True Thing"" and ""Betty"").  At least her fellow actors know a brilliant performer when they see one - as she's been nominated for a Best Actress SAG Award (over Nicole Kidman who was thought of as a shoo in for ""Moulin Rouge."")In a nutshell, this is a fun, entertaining movie, with great music, endearing moments of comedy, and another SHINING performance by Zellweger!",4,"Delicious Zellweger, Delectable Grant, and Hysterical Moment",1012435200,"01 31, 2002",2002,2630,"['What', 'wonderful', 'surprise', 'movie', 'was', 'resisted', 'admit', 'thinking', 'would', ""n't"", 'relate', 'plump', 'heroine', 'coping', 'loveless', 'sex', 'dueling', 'suitors', 'haughty', 'English', 'folk', 'not', 'only', 'movie', 'sparkle', 'unexpected', 'laugh-riot', 'moments', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'yet', 'again', 'what', 'stunning', 'actress', 'become', 'title', 'role', 'silly', 'coy', 'once', 'vapid', 'brilliant', 'heroine', 'generation', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'slimy-sleazy', 'boss', 'real', 'departure', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'Jimmy', 'STewart-ish', 'character', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'excels', 'unlikable', 'suitor', 'who', 'end', 'Bridget', 'intelligence', 'heroism', 'deep', 'warmth', 'rarely', 'allowed', 'shine', 'ultimately', 'Bridget', 'who', 'shell', 'exchanging', 'own', 'newer', 'model', 'Ever', 'Jerry', 'MaGuire', 'made', 'star', 'Zellweger', 'was', 'dazzled', 'screen', 'roles', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'One', 'True', 'Thing', 'actress', 'who', 'able', 'fully', 'expose', 'character', 'warts', 'Where', 'other', 'actresses', 'might', 'shy', 'away', 'brash', 'bold', 'characters', 'Zellweger', 'process', 'audience', 'love', 'sort', 'face', 'stories', 'small', 'seemingly', 'unimportant', 'facial', 'expressions', 'raised', 'eyebrow', 'here', 'pursed', 'lip', 'there', 'able', 'convey', 'layers', 'emotional', 'context', 'depth', 'very', 'few', 'contemporaries', 'can', 'ever', 'hope', 'achieve', 'spellbinding', 'work', 'opposite', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'One', 'True', 'Thing', 'proof', 'positive', 'star', 'here', 'stay', 'attention', 'quite', 'possibly', 'best', 'actress', 'today', 'generation', 'Very', 'few', 'actresses', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'shine', 'legendary', 'Streep', 'Zellweger', 'more', 'film', 'one', 'fully', 'realized', 'character', 'infusing', 'Bridget', 'wit', 'charm', 'charisma', 'more', 'anything', 'REALNESS', 'Ultimately', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'multiple', 'levels', 'Zellweger', 'pull', 'off', 'will', 'allow', 'even', 'men', 'see', 'parts', 'Bridget', 'eyes', 'Warm', 'lighthearted', 'filled', 'detail', 'myriad', 'emotions', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'winner', 'Let', 'hope', 'Zellweger', 'finally', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'deserved', 'other', 'roles', 'McGuire', 'One', 'True', 'Thing', 'Betty', 'least', 'fellow', 'actors', 'know', 'brilliant', 'performer', 'when', 'see', 'one', 'been', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'SAG', 'Award', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'was', 'thought', 'shoo', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'nutshell', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'great', 'music', 'endearing', 'moments', 'comedy', 'SHINING', 'performance', 'Zellweger']",Bridget Jones's Diary

Sleepless in Seattle, Jerry Maguire and Aliens are three classic examples of ""chick flicks"" that men can watch with their ladies, enjoy the film, and still get credit for being a sensitive guy that likes what she likes.Bridget Jones's Diary tries to come across as a frothy crossover comedy.

She is madly in love with her boss, played by Hugh Grant, who is a selfish, self-centered womanizer.  She flirts with him in an outrageous manner until, wonder of wonders, he does make a pass at her.  Bridget is hilarious as an awkward, tongue-tied, falling-down, sort of girl and Grant plays off her character well.

As with Russell Crowe in ""Gladiator"", Audrey Hepburn in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and Robert Powell in ""Jesus of Nazareth""; Ren&eacute;e Zellwegger definitely deserves an award for her performance as the typical British singleton Bridget Jones. I have read the book, which I found nothing special and actually sort of boring. However, one has to admit it is the type of novel which could undeniably make for a wonderful comedy movie. Add that the performance of someone like Zellwegger and... we have a winner!When Ren&eacute;e Zellwegger was cast for the starring role in this production, eyebrows were raised high in Hollywood. After all, she is the typical American girl, not at all British. The fact that she didn't have the required accent didn't help either. But Zellwegger determined to overcome all these obstacles and gave the best performance of her life so far. After seeing this movie, no one can deny they couldn't imagine anybody else in the role. The part I liked the most was almost at the beginning, when she is alone in her apartment and lip-sings (and mock-plays) to the lyrics of ""All by myself"". I laugh so hard! I could imagine anyone going through such a situation and behaving exactly so.To make a little history, ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" is based on the novel by Helen Fielding, about a 32 year British woman who seems to have no luck at marriage or even at a stable relationship at that. She feels marked for future ""spinsterhood"", ending her days alone, half eaten by dogs. She falls in love with all the wrong men, among them her boss, Daniel Cleever, played here by none other than British Hugh Grant. It is a relief to know Mr. Grant can also play roles where he is not always the laughing stock. But suddenly, one day love arrives at Bridget's doorstep - literally - and as it usually does, quite unexpectedly. Colin Firth is TO DIE FOR, in his role of the incomparable British macho who can make every lady's head spin around with love. He plays an insecure man, but who, in the end, knows how to claim what's his.I was very glad the movie was so much promising than the book. Zellwegger brings to the screen a rich, comic, lively character otherwise too flat in the book. When we hope she would run right after her hero something always happens. One ends up feeling she might be too latefor her own happiness, but then...

Gelwasser,"[1, 1]","In this fast paced, modern age it seems, that society and especially the media have all these requirements and expectations of young single women. They should have a high profile professional job, supermodel looks, be suave, witty and sophisticated...oh and also be able to land that perfect husband and have the perfect 2.5 children by the time the old biological clock goes off. These ideals are all satirized and laid to waste in the hilarious British, romatic film comedy, ""Bridget Jones's Diary"". In this film we meet Bridget Jones, who hardly meets society's  standards and ideals. She's somewhat overweight (at least by Hollywood standards) and drinks and smokes way to much! Bridget is terrible at her different jobs in the media profession and has got to be the world's worst public speaker, who often blurts out the most embarassing comments at the wrong time. Too make matters worst, she seems to have no luck in the romance department. Bridget Jones is the kind of gal constantly making memos on how she's going to take the world on and make her life right in the process. Unfortunatly for every giant leap she attempts, there is usually a bannana peel waiting to embarassingly be stepped on. The film's plotline is liberally (and proudly) swiped from Jane Austen's classic novel, ""Pride & Prejudice"". Two men keep coming and going into her love life. First is her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) a witty, handsome, but vile Cad, who over and over again wriggles his way into Bridget's bed, only to find a way to break her heart, whenever things get serious. Bridget's other would-be suiter is family friend, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). He's a bit wooden in personality and even a stuffshirt and somewhat rude. But he's also kind, honest and dependable. Well I bet you can figure out, which guy constantly has Bridget's affections for most of the film! (BIG Hint: Nice guys seem to always finish last!) In the end Bridget goes for the guy, who just loves her for being herself, not for what she's trying to pretend to be. The script by Helen Fielding (based on her book & newspaper columns) and Richard Curtis (the dean of British romantic film comedies) is both witty and enjoyable. All three of the film's lead actors seem to have loads of chemistry together. Texas born, Renee Zellweger pulls off the British accent and totally becomes this modern day every-women, who finds inventive ways to become embarassed at any moment. Hugh Grant, who seems to have made a career out of playing eye lash fluttering, nice guy roles, gleefully takes on the devilish cad of the film with great success. Finally, Colin Firth seems like the only actor, who could play the Mark Darcy role. The movie's writers freely admit that they wrote the part for him based ironically on his own performance in the movie ""Pride & Prejudice"". The DVD of the film is fine. The picture & sound are sevicable but nothing special. In this collector's addition you recieve a nice behind-the-scenes featurette, that is quite interesting. Also included are deleted scenes, which to be perfectly honest, are as funny as anything from the final film. (This includes a hilarious montage of Hugh Grant's slimey, Daniel being interviewed, while sitting in a bar with a wide variey of seamy looking dates) It's obvious in this DVD edition that some of the extras are being used to hype the film's sequal, ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"". Many of the extras are fine, but not necessary. This is a wonderful romantic comedy, that is most entertaining.

536432,A3MPV6UPZ3LLAM,B00003CXT7,K. N. Nelson,"[5, 6]","(...) I enjoyed it tremendously, especially on DVD.  Colin Firth reanimates an updated edition of the stuffy Mr. Darcy character that he so magnetically portrayed in Pride and Prejudice.  There is something so entrancing in the way he engages the audience with those intense brown eyes.Renee Z. is really cute and believable as Bridget Jones. She has the pale skin and cheeky wholesomeness often seen in British actors even though Renee is an American. Her considerable, innate personal charm adds to a role that, in the hands of a less gifted actor, may have been difficult to pull off. Hugh Grant is, refreshingly, quite thoroughly smarmy in his role as the boyfriend who is basically a jerk. I always enjoy him as an actor, and this film adds a new dimension to his acting chops. His recital of that really vulgar poem while sitting in the boat on the lake where Firth and his companion are also boating and trying to discuss legal matters in their formal and so correct manner is hilarious.  They overhear the recital and watch as Grant straddles the two boats in his attempt to join Bridget in hers and when Grant falls into the water it is a real ""gotcha"" on film.

All the moments you turn into a blithering idiot and the more you try to extricate yourself, the worse it gets.  And while in some ways you feel guilty that you're like this, you really do spend that much time trying on different outfits and worrying about each little item of clothing, each body part.  It's nice to see that in a movie character, because it gives you so much more to identify with than the visions of perfection we so often see.  Sad that we have to hear about how hard Renee Zellweger had to work to get up to a weight most of us have gotten up to effortlessly -- she was great at the part, actually, but why can't we for a change see someone who didn't have to work hard to look like most of us?That's not a problem with the movie itself, though.  Like I say, Renee Zellweger gives an excellent performance, as does Hugh Grant.  I still don't see the Colin Firth thing myself, but he was good in this.

Thinking that it was going to be another Gen X piece of claptrap, I gritted my teeth and prepared myself for what I erroneously thought would be a waste of time. Was I ever wrong! It turned out to be a sublime cinematic experience.Renee Zellweger is definitely the star of this film. She positively twinkles! She is absolutely marvelous in the role of Bridget Jones, our single, thirty something, English Holly-Go-Lightly. Employed as a somewhat graceless publicist, the plump and perky Bridget enters into an affair with her caddish, handsome, sexy boss, winningly played by the ever charming and debonair Hugh Grant.Meanwhile, her mother has introduced her to an attorney, the stiff-necked Mr. Darcy, played to taciturn perfection by Colin Firth. Even though they were once childhood playmates, he and Bridget do not initially click, and it is not love at first sight, as Bridget's mother had so hoped. Bridget goes on her merry way with her boss, unaware that he is two-timing her. When she discovers his perfidy, it is too late, as she already fancies herself in love with him.Mr. Darcy, however, re-enters the picture, and what happens is a thing of beauty to watch. The film is very funny. Rene Zellweger as a Brit is totally believable. She is so good that she would even fool the Queen into believing her to be one of the Queen's own subjects. Without a doubt, this is one of Ms. Zellweger's best roles to date, and she is positively delightful. Moreover, Sharon Maguire's directorial debut is certainly noteworthy, as she shows signs of a deft comedic touch in her direction. This is simply a terrific film.

I assume that the book was full of sharp and witty observations that rang true.  I have a feeling though, that even though Renee Zellweger does an outstanding acting job in the lead role, the screenplay does not capture that spirit.Ms. Zellweger is a fine actress and the audience can certainly identify with her search for Mr. Right as her biological clock keeps ticking along.  Hugh Grant is cast as her boss and lover with an aversion to commitment.  Colin Firth is cast as a stuffy barrister who is also interested in Bridget. There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep the story moving along and some of it is humorous, but just not enough to make this lightweight romantic comedy rise above the ordinary.  I, personally, would never have been interested without the draw of the book's reputation and the fact that I am fast becoming a Renee Zellweger fan. She's a delight to watch and her freshness shines in every single role she's ever played.At 97 minutes, the film still seemed too long.  But please  nderstand that I'm not a fan of romantic comedy as a genre.  I like a film to have a little more substance than the ups and downs of a romance that the audience knows is going to work out for the best in the long run anyway.  There's a happy ending of course, but so what?  Sometimes though, a lightweight movie like this can be fun.  So, even though it was a bit too insipid for my personal taste, it can be enjoyed for what it is, some pleasant time that will leave you feeling good.

Not a novel idea really; Jane Austen's &quot;Emma&quot; was already served up pretty well some years back in Alicia Silverstone's &quot;Clueless&quot;. What was funnier for me back then was that I hadn't known that before I was in the theatre with &quot;Clueless&quot;, and it only dawned on me during the scenes with Elton, named for the maritally overreaching minister in the original novel. Here in &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot;, we've got a Mr. Darcy, just like in Austen's novel, too (even played by Colin Firth, the latest PandP Mr. Darcy). But this time I already was clued into its being an updating, so the fun of the shock wasn't there.However, a movie needn't have to produce an epiphany to be amusing. This is a very amusing film, about a somewhat ribald, smoking, drinking, overeating young woman and her New Year's resolution to cut down on all the bad habits and get herself a man. She wears the most appalling  mini skirts to work, and so eventually receives an email come-on from her cad of a boss, Hugh Grant. She launches her affair with him, all the while bumping into the staid Colin Firth, whom she met at a Christmas party and took a dislike to when she heard him talking about her behind her back. And just like Jane Austen novels, it really looks like  our heroine will lose all and be one lonely lady, until everything miraculously works out in her favor.So, if you're up to seeing a new spin on a classic romance, sneak a peek at &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot; sometime in the near future.",4,Dear Diary...,1023062400,"06 3, 2002",2002,1643,"['what', 'do', 'think', 'making', '21st', 'century', 'version', 'quot', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'quot', 'Well', 'what', 'here', 'Not', 'novel', 'idea', 'really', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'quot', 'Emma', 'quot', 'was', 'already', 'served', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'years', 'back', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'quot', 'Clueless', 'quot', 'What', 'was', 'funnier', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'had', ""n't"", 'known', 'was', 'theatre', 'quot', 'Clueless', 'quot', 'only', 'dawned', 'scenes', 'Elton', 'named', 'maritally', 'overreaching', 'minister', 'original', 'novel', 'Here', 'quot', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'just', 'Austen', 'novel', 'too', 'even', 'played', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'latest', 'PandP', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'time', 'already', 'was', 'clued', 'being', 'updating', 'fun', 'shock', 'was', ""n't"", 'there.However', 'movie', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'produce', 'epiphany', 'be', 'amusing', 'very', 'amusing', 'film', 'somewhat', 'ribald', 'smoking', 'drinking', 'overeating', 'young', 'woman', 'New', 'Year', 'resolution', 'cut', 'down', 'bad', 'habits', 'get', 'man', 'most', 'appalling', 'mini', 'skirts', 'work', 'so', 'eventually', 'email', 'come-on', 'cad', 'boss', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'affair', 'while', 'bumping', 'staid', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'whom', 'met', 'Christmas', 'party', 'took', 'dislike', 'when', 'heard', 'talking', 'back', 'just', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novels', 'really', 'heroine', 'will', 'lose', 'be', 'one', 'lonely', 'lady', 'everything', 'miraculously', 'out', 'favor.So', ""'re"", 'up', 'seeing', 'new', 'spin', 'classic', 'romance', 'sneak', 'peek', 'quot', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'quot', 'sometime', 'near', 'future']",Bridget Jones's Diary

There's a lot of comedy-romances out there but what makes this one so popular?  I think it's the original character of Bridget herself.  She seems authentic; she's a mess-up.  We can relate because we've done similar stupid things ourselves.  And she really doesn't change from clumsy duckling into beautiful swan in the movie--she's still the gauche duckling but suddenly her gaucheness becomes quite charming. Her authentic self is an asset when she finds a situation that suits her.  This is the original message in the film and why it's so popular, I believe, because it says maybe we're okay, as is, too. We don't have to become perfect to be lovable. We just have to find a place and people who appreciate our unique and original self.Renee Zellwegger doesn't even seem like she's acting as she's got the role of Bridget down so well.  Hugh Grant plays the cad perfectly and Colin Firth is charming as the cold and arrogant Darcy.  The change in him to the warm and playful Darcy seems a bit abrupt but maybe the aloofness was just a facade.  The tarts and vicar party is one of my favorite scenes.

Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are beautiful, charming, and easy to love, making us understand why Bridget would be so torn up between the two.The movie strings together one funny set-piece after another, as when Bridget goes in costume to a party where she thought the theme was ""Tarts & Vicars."" Or when she stumbles into a job on a TV news show and makes her famous premature entrance down the fire pole. Or when she has to decide at the beginning of an evening whether sexy underwear or tummy-crunching underwear will do her more good in the long run. Bridget charts her own progress along the way, from ""tragic spinster"" to ""wanton sex goddess,"" and the movie gives almost unreasonable pleasure as it celebrates her bumpy transition.This is a fine film, full of terrific one-liners, memorable scenes, and great characters.

Renee Zellweger had no trouble mastering a British accent as she stumbles and fumbles her plodding way in scene after scene, yet with each mini-disaster she emerges as the kind of woman that one rarely sees on either the big screen or small: one who is a walking mass of tics and insecurities.  Director Sharon McGuire borrowed liberally from PRIDE AND PREJUDICE by Jane Austen to update the tale of a young woman seeking lasting love, but having to stumble along the way.  Colin Firth, who played Darcy Fitzwilliam in the BBC production of Austen's classic, here reprises--sort of--his role as the emotionlessly haughty Mark Darcy who sees Bridget at first only as she surely sees herself, a lump of undesirable femininity that wears bad clothes.  He sees her, he rejects her with the same cutting remarks that as Darcy Fitzwilliam he used against Elizabeth Bennett.  Bridget turns to her trio of friends who in their unswerving and funny support very nearly steal the show.  Bridget chainsmokes in between binge eating, all the while threatening to blimp out as the rapidly aging spinster that all mothers warn their daughters about should these daughters forget that extra weight guarantees no husband.  But Bridget has gumption.  She jumps on a stationary bicycle, and despite the many references to her supposed pudginess, still manages to look quite attractive in the many scenes where you can see her legs and butt. Along the way, she begins an affair with her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), who starts off as the perfect date: handsome, suave, debonnaire, and single. Hugh Grant is the Cary Grant of our age. In most of his films, he is the male second banana to top rank actresses like Julia Roberts or Sandra Bullock.  With these actresses, he need do no more than set up the inevitable romantic machinery that allows him to meet, romance, break up, and then reconcile with them.  He is quite good at that, but it is only in his rare role as the slightly raffish player that a newer and darker side emerges.  Grant as Daniel is not evil nor is he particularly vindictive.  He is a handsome man who has learned to trade in on his looks for so long that he has never had to look elsewhere for self-confidence.  Still, as a counterfoil to Bridget, he is roguishly charming as a man who once betrayed a friend and has had to regret it ever since.  Colin Firth as Mark Darcy comes across as the stuffy bear that he is, but it takes Bridget the longest time to recognize that he is the way that he is because of the ways that both she and Daniel are.  When Mark tells her that he likes her just the way she is, Bridget's metamorphosis from fake external Playboy bunny glamour to the more substantial beauty that results when one has one's emotional feet firmly planted becomes clear enough to both her trio of friends and to the audience who is not sure whether the stuffiness of Mark or the suavity of Daniel would be the better choice. The choice that Bridget does make is one that reaffirms the validity of common sense romantic entanglements.  BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY is a treat on so many levels that when she does make her choice, we can only applaud what to us would have been that same choice.",5,I Like You Just the Way You Are,1058918400,"07 23, 2003",2003,3431,"['When', 'Helen', 'Fielding', 'published', 'BRIDGET', 'JONES', 'DIARY', 'heroine', 'BRIDGET', 'became', 'symbol', 'slightly', 'overweight', 'chainsmoking', 'spinster-to-be', 'rang', 'resonant', 'bell', 'here', 'United', 'States', 'England', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'had', 'trouble', 'mastering', 'British', 'accent', 'plodding', 'way', 'scene', 'scene', 'yet', 'mini-disaster', 'kind', 'woman', 'one', 'rarely', 'big', 'screen', 'small', 'one', 'who', 'walking', 'mass', 'tics', 'insecurities', 'Director', 'Sharon', 'McGuire', 'borrowed', 'liberally', 'PRIDE', 'AND', 'PREJUDICE', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'update', 'tale', 'young', 'woman', 'seeking', 'lasting', 'love', 'having', 'stumble', 'way', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'who', 'played', 'Darcy', 'Fitzwilliam', 'BBC', 'production', 'Austen', 'classic', 'here', 'sort', 'role', 'emotionlessly', 'haughty', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'who', 'Bridget', 'first', 'only', 'surely', 'lump', 'undesirable', 'femininity', 'bad', 'clothes', 'same', 'cutting', 'remarks', 'Darcy', 'Fitzwilliam', 'used', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennett', 'Bridget', 'trio', 'friends', 'who', 'unswerving', 'funny', 'support', 'very', 'nearly', 'steal', 'show', 'Bridget', 'binge', 'eating', 'while', 'threatening', 'blimp', 'out', 'rapidly', 'aging', 'spinster', 'mothers', 'warn', 'daughters', 'should', 'daughters', 'forget', 'extra', 'weight', 'husband', 'Bridget', 'gumption', 'stationary', 'bicycle', 'many', 'references', 'supposed', 'pudginess', 'still', 'look', 'quite', 'attractive', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'legs', 'butt', 'way', 'affair', 'boss', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'who', 'off', 'perfect', 'date', 'handsome', 'suave', 'debonnaire', 'single', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'age', 'most', 'films', 'male', 'second', 'banana', 'top', 'rank', 'actresses', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'actresses', 'need', 'do', 'more', 'set', 'up', 'inevitable', 'romantic', 'machinery', 'meet', 'romance', 'break', 'up', 'then', 'reconcile', 'quite', 'good', 'only', 'rare', 'role', 'slightly', 'raffish', 'player', 'newer', 'darker', 'side', 'emerges', 'Grant', 'Daniel', 'not', 'evil', 'particularly', 'vindictive', 'handsome', 'man', 'who', 'learned', 'trade', 'looks', 'so', 'long', 'never', 'had', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'self-confidence', 'Still', 'counterfoil', 'Bridget', 'roguishly', 'charming', 'man', 'who', 'once', 'betrayed', 'friend', 'had', 'regret', 'ever', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'stuffy', 'bear', 'Bridget', 'longest', 'time', 'recognize', 'way', 'ways', 'Daniel', 'are', 'When', 'Mark', 'just', 'way', 'Bridget', 'metamorphosis', 'fake', 'external', 'Playboy', 'bunny', 'glamour', 'more', 'substantial', 'beauty', 'results', 'when', 'one', 'one', 'emotional', 'feet', 'firmly', 'planted', 'becomes', 'clear', 'enough', 'trio', 'friends', 'audience', 'who', 'not', 'sure', 'stuffiness', 'Mark', 'suavity', 'Daniel', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'choice', 'choice', 'Bridget', 'make', 'one', 'validity', 'common', 'sense', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'BRIDGET', 'JONES', 'DIARY', 'treat', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'when', 'make', 'choice', 'can', 'only', 'applaud', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'choice']",Bridget Jones's Diary
536461,A1YNYT8F584IYV,B00003CXT7,"MarvelousMarla ""MarvyM""","[4, 5]","This was a cute film about a hapless, 30-something singleton trying to make her way in the world. I can relate to the main character on many levels, with the exception of the weight thing. I workout 4-5 days a week and wear a size 8. Nonetheless, the title character didn't look all that big to me. I think it's a sad commentary on society when a perfectly average-looking size 12 woman is considered chubby. That aside, the film is dead-on accurate in its portrayal of some of the self-destructive things that we females can sometimes do to ourselves -- the chain smoking, the excessive drinking, the binging and let me not forget the bad habit of hooking up with unsuitable men. In many ways this movie holds a mirror up to how some of us really live, which is markedly different from what we would have others believe. Not all single women are living like the gals on ""Sex And the City."" Some of us are quite ordinary and clueless -- but not me of course. 8-)Zellweger is convincing as the earnest, if clumsy, Bridget. This is a physical comedy complete with many pratfalls and sight gags -- I was in stitches at the sight of those big ole granny panties that she chose instead of that little black thong. And who could forget her television debut that showed her entire butt the world after she slid down a pole?I have to admit that ending surprised me because I thought that Mark was gone for good after he (rather nosily!) read some of our heroine's cutting remarks about him in her diary. But Bridget ran after him into the cold night, wearing next to nothing, and gets the surprise of her life. Ah, I am a sucker for a story with a happy ending. Some viewers complained that the movie implied that Bridget felt incomplete without a man, however, that is not my take on it. She wanted him, and he reciprocated her feelings. What's so bad about that? Further, I think that most of us desire companionship and spend quite a bit of time pursuing it and/or lamenting the lack thereof. It's not like Bridget closed herself off from the world and put her life on hold until Prince Charming arrived. True she did look in the wrong places and did wallow a bit in self-pity, but I think she was getting it together toward the end. At the very least, she was not afraid to make herself vulnerable even when she had plenty of reason to be gun-shy. And if that isn't courageous, then I don't know what is. I enjoyed this movie about an average Jane determined to proceed through life despite the occasional pitfall.

I do know that Bridget Jones's Diary is very British, even if it does star an American from Texas, and is one of the year's best comedies. It also travels well, as they say. Bridget's problems and fears are familiar to millions of people around the globe. She's the kind of character we laugh with instead of at.Bridget [Renee Zellweger] is in her early thirties. She lives in London in a modest flat. She has an okay job at an upscale publishing company. She doesn't have a bad life, but she has reached that age where she's beginning to fear much of the good things in life may pass her by. She's also beginning to fret about her bad habits. She smokes, she drinks, and she eats too much. One day her urbane and sexy boss, Daniel [Hugh Grant], notices her. Bridget is worldly enough to know this may lead to something but too innocent to see that an affair with him probably won't turn out well in the long run. Mark [Colin Firth], a handsome but priggish acquaintance of Bridget's definitely knows Daniel is no good for her, but his way of telling her this only serves to make her want Daniel more than ever. Meanwhile, Bridget's parents are having problems of their own, and Mom winds up running off with the silly, pompous host of a TV show.Zellweger was reluctant to take on the role of Bridget because, while the story is universal, it would not have survived being lifted out of its native England. New York for example, would have been entirely the wrong setting. She must have got the role right because the movie has been an even bigger hit in the U. K than it has been in America. After seeing her in it, I can't imagine anyone else's playing Brigit. It is a role she will always be identified with. Hugh Grant is marvelous, as always. He played a sort of male version of Bridget in Four Weddings and a Funeral, but, if anything, he is even better at playing a cad than he is a portraying a nice guy. Few actors can sum up a character in the first seconds of screen time as Grant does here. In his first scene he enters with a little smirk on his face that instantly tells us he's up to no good. As Mark, Colin Firth is first-rate. It's a role few actors could get right because Mark must always act prim and proper, yet also project enough warmth for the audience to relate to him. IF Firth hadn't been able to do this, the movie wouldn't have made sense.Bridget Jones's Diary's greatest appeal is to women because her problems, as well as her responses to them, are mainly feminine ones. Still, many men will also be charmed by it because it's so original and funny. This Bridget's definitely a winner.",5,Absolutely fabulous comedy,1015891200,"03 12, 2002",2002,2738,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'British', 'are', 'funnier', 'overall', 'Americans', 'are', 'exposed', 'only', 'best', 'have', 'offer', 'do', 'know', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'very', 'British', 'even', 'star', 'American', 'Texas', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'comedies', 'also', 'well', 'say', 'Bridget', 'problems', 'fears', 'are', 'familiar', 'millions', 'people', 'globe', 'kind', 'character', 'laugh', 'instead', 'at.Bridget', '[', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', ']', 'early', 'thirties', 'London', 'modest', 'flat', 'okay', 'job', 'upscale', 'publishing', 'company', ""n't"", 'have', 'bad', 'life', 'reached', 'age', 'where', 'beginning', 'fear', 'much', 'good', 'things', 'life', 'may', 'pass', 'also', 'beginning', 'fret', 'bad', 'habits', 'too', 'much', 'One', 'day', 'urbane', 'sexy', 'boss', 'Daniel', '[', 'Hugh', 'Grant', ']', 'Bridget', 'worldly', 'enough', 'know', 'may', 'lead', 'something', 'too', 'innocent', 'see', 'affair', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'well', 'long', 'run', 'Mark', '[', 'Colin', 'Firth', ']', 'handsome', 'priggish', 'acquaintance', 'Bridget', 'definitely', 'Daniel', 'good', 'way', 'telling', 'only', 'make', 'want', 'Daniel', 'more', 'ever', 'Meanwhile', 'Bridget', 'parents', 'are', 'having', 'problems', 'own', 'Mom', 'up', 'running', 'off', 'silly', 'pompous', 'host', 'TV', 'show.Zellweger', 'was', 'reluctant', 'take', 'role', 'Bridget', 'story', 'universal', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'survived', 'being', 'lifted', 'native', 'England', 'New', 'York', 'example', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'entirely', 'wrong', 'setting', 'must', 'have', 'got', 'role', 'right', 'movie', 'been', 'even', 'bigger', 'hit', 'U.', 'K', 'been', 'America', 'seeing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'Brigit', 'role', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'identified', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'marvelous', 'always', 'played', 'sort', 'male', 'version', 'Bridget', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'anything', 'even', 'better', 'playing', 'cad', 'portraying', 'nice', 'guy', 'Few', 'actors', 'can', 'sum', 'up', 'character', 'first', 'seconds', 'screen', 'time', 'Grant', 'here', 'first', 'scene', 'little', 'smirk', 'face', 'instantly', 'up', 'good', 'Mark', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'first-rate', 'role', 'few', 'actors', 'could', 'get', 'right', 'Mark', 'must', 'always', 'act', 'prim', 'proper', 'yet', 'also', 'project', 'enough', 'warmth', 'audience', 'relate', 'IF', 'Firth', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'do', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'sense.Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'greatest', 'appeal', 'women', 'problems', 'as', 'well', 'responses', 'are', 'mainly', 'feminine', 'ones', 'Still', 'many', 'men', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'charmed', 'so', 'original', 'funny', 'Bridget', 'definitely', 'winner']",Bridget Jones's Diary

536464,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00003CXT7,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[3, 3]","Based on the book by Helen Fielding, I have to confess I never read the book or even heard of it until after I saw the film! And I loved it. Had to get the sequel, The Edge of Reason. People who read it originally ripped the film to shreds, but I loved both.Considering it was filmed in England, there were a lot of English actresses up for the role, including Kate Winslet, but I'm so glad Renee got the role. And how she ever managed to perfect that English accent, and not let a slip of her Texan drawl through was amazing.The song ""All By Myself"" is the song/motto that single girls should live by! Heaven knows I've played it often enough! And Bridget's men self help books are well documented in the film, and the scene where she throws them in the bin and then takes them back out again, is very poignant, cos every woman has at least one of those hidden away in her bookcase!In every entry in the book, it starts by listing her weight, cigarettes smoked, and alcohol units, and I would have preferred to see that more often during the film, as it was good in the book.The scene where Hugh Grant first appears is enough to make every girl swoon. Hugh's character, Daniel Cleaver, shows Hugh going away from his usual ""good guy"" image in films, and moving into the ""bad boy"" image! Hugh is hardly what you would call a sex god normally but in this film . . . Ding-dong. And the scene where Hugh falls into the water, and surfaces in a wet shirt - well, you could just watch that scene over and over again!Bridget's friends, Shazza, Jude and Tom should have had a film just to themselves, and will hopefully appear more in the sequel. They were brilliant.To think the sales of the ""scary, stomach-holding-in pants, very popular with grannies"" actually soared after this film! Very scary thought.Mots of the audience will hate Mark Darcy's (Colin Firth) character and love Daniel Cleaver, but your feelings go back and forth throughout the film . . . well, until the finale anyway. The fight between Mark & Daniel is pure hilarious entertainment; backed by Geri Halliwell's ""It's Raining Men"". A very camp song for a very girly fight. If this is how real men fight, it doesn't bear thinking about! Hugh & Colin do a good job of fighting like a pair of girls  - and even that's saying something, as girls could fight better than that - slapping, scratching, kicking and hair pulling. Colin Firth is definitely so sexy in the finale. He's got really nice eyes.There's apparently a mistake while I haven't been able to spot yet. When Bridget & Daniel on away on the weekend mini break together, they're driving along and Bridget's wearing the scarf and sunglasses, trying to look like Grace Kelly. When the scarf blows off, it's supposed to be pulled off by a mysterious hand, which you can see when you go through the scene frame by frame.When Bridget goes to the Tarts & Vicars party, in her bunny girl outfit, if you watch the bunny ears, they reveal her moods. When she's feeling good, the ears are perky and upright, but as it progresses the ears gradually dip down, as her mood gets worse.The extras include Sharon MacGuire's commentary; behind the scenes featurette; Shelby Lynne's ""Killing Kind"" music video; Gabrielle's ""Out Of Reach"" music video; deleted scenes and original Bridget Jones's Diary columns. Both music videos have very inspirational lyrics. The featurette shows the woman behind the book, Helen Fielding, and Bridget Jones herself Renee Zellweger. Helen Fielding admits to ""stealing"" the plot from Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice, which doesn't make sense, but then again, I've never had the pleasure of reading that book!And THAT kiss. Everyone knows which kiss I'm talking about. That is the perfect kiss. Nothing could amount or even surpass that perfect kiss!There is a bit of Bridget Jones in everyone, and I can't wait for the rumoured sequel, The Edge Of Reason, which Renee Zellweger is busy putting on weight for - and its all going on her cheeks. I hope it's as good as the first, but I didn't find the book as good as the first. And in the sequel, Bridget Jones gets to interview Colin Firth - but he's already in the film.

This film is a funny, warm, and realistic take on singledom.Renee Zellweger not only pulled off a near-flawless British accent to where I almost forgot she was from Texas, but she brought a lot of charm and wit to Bridget.  She wasn't perfect and she often embarassed herself.  I think movies too often try to portray these perfect women and the guys as the idiots who humiliate themselves to get near them.  But women do silly things to sometimes.  And these things can be just as funny as Freddie Prinze, Jr. falling down or something.The men are good in this movie too.  Colin Firth is the smug British male, unwilling to admit his feelings, insecure.  You spend half the movie trying to figure out whether to love or hate him, but the end fills in the gaps for you.  Hugh Grant, always great, is cocky and slimy.  But how many mistakes have women dated?  All of us girls have seen this character in our dating life.My only criticism:  Bridget is not fat, at least Renee wasn't fat in the film.  I get tired of the Hollywood standards of what is beautiful and skinny.  Renee looked like a normal healthy woman to me, a kind of girl who has become unappreciated in this society as of late.  Guys, please, reconsider your obsession with plastic and opt for the natural woman.

Ren?e Zellweger is fabulous in her part, as is the rest of the cast.  Of course Colin Firth is amazing, as Mr. Darcy is the only role I really see him fit to play.  He is perfect in his role, although I don't think anyone else could have played it.  Hugh Grant, whom I normally don't like (with the exception of Sense &amp; Sensibility), is wonderful in his role as Daniel.  I've never liked him much as a good guy in movies, but he makes a perfect jerk.This movie is a must-see, whether or not you've read the book.  There are a lot of subtle references to P&amp;P that can easily be missed and are fun to find.  Such as the first time I watched I didn't notice that the publishing company was called Pimberley.  I didn't notice until I saw the logo on the wall in one of the scenes.  I'm sure if you've read the book, this doesn't seem so subtle, but it's still fun to recognize these things.Also, this has the one thing no other P&amp;P film, mini-series or sequel has - terribly fake, but hilarious fighting between Darcy &amp; Wickham/Daniel to 'It's Raining Men.'",5,V.

Renee Zellweger has been making movies for a decade but only recently has she begun to hit the Big Time. She certainly hits the mark here as a lovable, loopy Londoner in her thirties (same age as the actress) who is trying to deal with the prospect of spinsterhood. Whatever comes into her mind is likely to come right out her mouth without traveling by way of her brain, and Zellweger comic sense makes the most of the opportunities. She has a real sense of visual comedy, mugging without quite seeming to and performing pratfalls that seem almost unstudied. Though a Houston native, she also manages a respectable Brit accent. Hugh Grant plays a somewhat slimy &quot;Hugh Grant&quot; character with his usual disreputable charm, and Colin Firth plays a stiff, haughty barrister who is drawn to Bridget against his better judgment.

536470,A1Y78WGTPIN9YV,B00003CXT7,"Michelle ""Navy Gunner""","[0, 0]","This movie did justice to Fielding's Bridget in every way. It kept with Fielding's British comedy. And you felt like you were watching Bridget Jone's life through her diary with the off screen narratives. It kept with a lot of the books' plots and style.Ren&eacute;e Zellweger was a good pick to play her. She kept the character both funny and light.Hugh Grant was the perfect attitude and image of the bad boy Daniel Cleaver. He played the perfect womanizer.Colin Firth played Mark Darcy. He was really good at portraying the character. He was both macho and nice. And it was cute too, because Bridget's character is supposed to have this crush on the actor Colin Firth due to the BBC miniseries 'Pride and Prejudice'(1996).The fight between the two guys for Bridget was perfect in the movie. I was very happy when Colin gave Hugh that last punch in the face.**********************Helen Fielding is an excellent comedic in this Bridget series. The first portion of the book Bridget had me laughing right at the start. Her New Years resolution was long with will not and wills. But there were some resolutions that I could even relate to.The English slang words were both cute and funny (""emotional f**kwits"") There's also Jone's abbreviations (i.e.: v. and v.g. = very and very good) that even I found myself using for a little while.Her love triangle with her boss Daniel Cleaver (all bad boy) and lawyer Mark Darcy (good guy) is really romantic. Daniel is the guy that she resolved not to obsess about as he is an alcoholic, workaholic, commitment phobic, chauvinist and emotional f**kwit (all things she also resolved not to fall for). Mark is the good guy who finishes last. Yes, he was already taken (the woman was a crazy needy woman who didn't love him). Yes, he couldn't make decision or stand up for himself (the clothes he wore were his mother's choices). But after a while I could tell that she should pick the lawyer over the cheat.This is a good Brit-lit series (2 1/2 books).

But she did such a good job in ""Nurse Betty"", I thought I'd give her the benefit of the doubt.  Well, she is absolutely perfect here.  Much has been made of her dramatic weight gain for the role.  Well, for the first third of the movie, it's not so apparent.  ""Bridge"" is actually quite svelte and sexy.  It is only later on when she makes furious attempts to hide her bulk does the weight show (a scene with Ren&eacute;e in a bunny outfit does the trick nicely).  And you know what?  Bridget's insecurities are apparent -- because she can't help but wear them on her sleeve -- but even more so are her passions, and the latter neatly cancels out the former.  She is still sexy.  Credit goes to Ren&eacute;e for pulling off this neat stunt.  She also sinks imperceptibly into her English accent, and shows a flair for self-deprecating physical comedy heretofore unseen.I always fancied myself as being a Hugh Grant fan.  Those who malign him for his repeated portrayal of shy and romantic Brits misunderstand that that is his greatest strength.  Play to your strengths, Hugh!  Fortunately, for those who need their performers to stretch, here Hugh mixes his usual character with a bit of caddishness.  And he does it so well.  You get every bit of the British wit he's so good at, plus a bit of danger, partially explaining Bridget's mistake at sleeping with her boss.  My one issue with Hugh is his insistence on maintaining his big-hair-and-open-shirt-with-big-collar look.  It served him well in ""Notting Hill"", but too much of a good thing is still Too Much of a good thing.I didn't fancy myself a Colin Firth fan or non-fan.  In fact, I haven't seen (or noticed) much of the man's worth.  I did happen to catch much of his famed ""Pride and Prejudice"" performance.  It confused me.  Why was this shy, angry, and difficult man so swoonworthy?  Well, the first half of this movie brought back those confusions.  Even though she denies it, why is Bridget attracted to this furrowed brow of a man?  The answer comes (definitively) later on, and I credit Firth for his patience, his willingness to be looked upon by half the audience as a stiff bore, and his subtlety in slowly turning those perceptions around.I'd also like to note that if Hugh Grant is in a movie penned (in this case, partially penned) by Richard Curtis (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill"" being the others), I'm there with bells on.  The one fits the other's words so perfectly, I'm hard pressed to find a better example of artistic simpatico.  Curtis, along with Andrew Davies and source novel author Helen Fielding does a fine job of adapting the book to the screen.  I read the book and, by the half way point, found Bridget's inner dialogues tiresome.  What was interesting in the beginning wore this reader down.  The film spends only as much time inside Bridget's head (and in her diary) as need be, utilizing sparse voiceover to great effect.  It also pares down the sub-plots (i.e., Bridget's mum and dad's marriage troubles; Bridget on TV), alluding to them only as plot devices.  A fine adaptation.  And credit should also go to first-time director Sharon Maguire, who infuses the film with a slightly surreal and definitely goofy quality, expertly handling the comedy (there's a wonderfully ridiculous party scene in which people keep asking Salman Rushdie for direction to the bathroom!) and the tender moments (the denouement teeters on the precipice that is melodramatic sentimentality, but Maguire does wonders in keeping it from toppling over).  This is a truly fine (and funny, and cathartic, and relevant, and revealing, and... etc.) movie.",5,Jonesing for more Jones,1001376000,"09 25, 2001",2001,3712,"['always', 'fancied', 'being', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'fan', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'Well', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'here', 'Much', 'been', 'made', 'dramatic', 'weight', 'gain', 'role', 'Well', 'first', 'third', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'apparent', 'Bridge', 'actually', 'quite', 'svelte', 'sexy', 'only', 'later', 'when', 'furious', 'attempts', 'hide', 'bulk', 'weight', 'show', 'scene', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'e', 'bunny', 'outfit', 'trick', 'nicely', 'know', 'what', 'Bridget', 'insecurities', 'are', 'apparent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wear', 'sleeve', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'are', 'passions', 'latter', 'neatly', 'out', 'former', 'still', 'sexy', 'Credit', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'e', 'pulling', 'off', 'neat', 'stunt', 'also', 'imperceptibly', 'English', 'accent', 'flair', 'self-deprecating', 'physical', 'comedy', 'heretofore', 'unseen.I', 'always', 'fancied', 'being', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'fan', 'who', 'malign', 'repeated', 'portrayal', 'shy', 'romantic', 'Brits', 'misunderstand', 'greatest', 'strength', 'Play', 'strengths', 'Hugh', 'Fortunately', 'who', 'need', 'performers', 'stretch', 'here', 'Hugh', 'mixes', 'usual', 'character', 'bit', 'caddishness', 'so', 'well', 'get', 'bit', 'British', 'wit', 'so', 'good', 'bit', 'danger', 'partially', 'explaining', 'Bridget', 'mistake', 'sleeping', 'boss', 'one', 'issue', 'Hugh', 'insistence', 'maintaining', 'big-hair-and-open-shirt-with-big-collar', 'look', 'served', 'well', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'thing', 'still', 'Too', 'Much', 'good', 'thing.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'fancy', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'fan', 'non-fan', 'fact', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'noticed', 'much', 'man', 'worth', 'did', 'happen', 'catch', 'much', 'famed', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'performance', 'confused', 'Why', 'was', 'shy', 'angry', 'difficult', 'man', 'swoonworthy', 'Well', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'brought', 'back', 'confusions', 'Even', 'why', 'Bridget', 'attracted', 'furrowed', 'brow', 'man', 'answer', 'definitively', 'later', 'credit', 'Firth', 'patience', 'willingness', 'be', 'looked', 'audience', 'stiff', 'bore', 'subtlety', 'slowly', 'turning', 'perceptions', 'around.I', ""'d"", 'also', 'like', 'note', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'movie', 'penned', 'case', 'partially', 'penned', 'Richard', 'Curtis', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'being', 'others', ""'m"", 'bells', 'one', 'other', 'words', 'so', 'perfectly', ""'m"", 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'better', 'example', 'artistic', 'simpatico', 'Curtis', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'source', 'novel', 'author', 'Helen', 'Fielding', 'fine', 'job', 'adapting', 'book', 'screen', 'read', 'book', 'half', 'way', 'point', 'found', 'Bridget', 'inner', 'tiresome', 'What', 'was', 'interesting', 'beginning', 'wore', 'reader', 'down', 'film', 'only', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'Bridget', 'head', 'diary', 'need', 'be', 'utilizing', 'sparse', 'voiceover', 'great', 'effect', 'also', 'down', 'sub-plots', 'i.e.', 'Bridget', 'mum', 'dad', 'marriage', 'troubles', 'Bridget', 'TV', 'alluding', 'only', 'plot', 'devices', 'fine', 'adaptation', 'credit', 'should', 'also', 'go', 'first-time', 'director', 'Sharon', 'Maguire', 'who', 'film', 'slightly', 'surreal', 'definitely', 'goofy', 'quality', 'expertly', 'handling', 'comedy', 'wonderfully', 'ridiculous', 'party', 'scene', 'people', 'keep', 'asking', 'Salman', 'Rushdie', 'direction', 'bathroom', 'tender', 'moments', 'denouement', 'teeters', 'precipice', 'melodramatic', 'sentimentality', 'Maguire', 'wonders', 'keeping', 'toppling', 'over', 'truly', 'fine', 'funny', 'cathartic', 'relevant', 'revealing', 'etc', 'movie']",Bridget Jones's Diary

Renee Zellweger was a surprising choice to play the completely English and dumpy Bridget, but she pulls it off brilliantly, particularly with the dull middle-class English accent which is very realistic. Bridget is 32, overweight, underpaid, and without a boyfriend. The flim, through the eyes of her diary, follows her amusing attempts to shape up, and get a man. In fact, she gets two men; her swarmy boss Daniel Cleaver, and a lawyer who she has known and detested from the age of five, Mark Darcy. Hugh Grant is wonderful as the slimy but irresitable Cleaver, and Colin Firth just as good as the slightly abrupt and reticent Darcy. There are good cameos from Jim Broadbent as Bridget's bumbling but likeable dad, and Gemma Jones as her snobbish mum. There are even surprise cameos from Jeffrey Archer and Salman Rushdie, both playing themselves. This cocktail makes for a most enteraining movie. There is emotion and seriousness in the right places, but lighter moments are never far away. The film will probably appeal particularly to younger women, but there is plenty in there for everyone, mainly because the film produces so many wonderful human charactitures. It's well worth buying, and bringing out over Christmas and when friends and family come round.

Still, she puts forth a good performance, as so many things are universal.Bridget Jones is a thirtysomething single woman living in London, struggling with the trials and tribulations a la Woody Allen crossed with Cathy from the comics.  She has to loose that weight, stop drinking so much, quit smoking, and find that intangible Mr. Right.  As opposed to all the shallow, self serving female characters in most chick flicks, we related to Bridget best.  She is sweet, trying her hardest and making efforts, and her bumbling antics make us laugh as much as they make us cry, knowing we have all been there at one point or another.In a classic Jane Austinesque situation (and one of the male leads just happens to be named Darcy on top of that), Bridget finds herself torn between two men.  On Christmas Day at her mother's annual party, she meets a vain, arrogant, rude man named Mark Darcy who her mother is pushing her into being friendly with.  When she overhears one of his insults, she is bent into thinking what a terrible man she is and is naturally, as Miss Austin would be proud of (no pun intended), prejudiced against him.  At work, she is hot for her boss, a slick, charming skirt played very well by Hugh Grant (when he is usually the lovable good guy in all his roles).  In a moment of weakness, Bridget gets played.  (Who hasn't been there?)  She soon finds out that Hugh Grant is not just a player, but contrary to what she had been lead to believe, he was caught mid coitus with Mark's wife and not vice versa.  In a great scene that we women can only dream about, the two get into a fist fight on the streets over her.And Mr. Darcy ... He's the perfect man after all.  Even when he finds her diary with all its stabs and slams against him, he goes out and buys her a new one.  He knows he's not perfect and loves Bridget just the way she is.  Isn't that what we all want?  And he even likes those nasty granny panties she wore.",4,There is hope for the chick flick genre after all,1184716800,"07 18, 2007",2007,2101,"['Many', 'were', 'irked', 'when', 'Rene', 'Zellwiger', 'was', 'chosen', 'play', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'being', 'American', 'let', 'alone', 'native', 'Texan', 'when', 'Bridget', 'English', 'heroine', 'Still', 'forth', 'good', 'performance', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'are', 'universal.Bridget', 'Jones', 'thirtysomething', 'single', 'woman', 'living', 'London', 'struggling', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'la', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'crossed', 'Cathy', 'comics', 'loose', 'weight', 'stop', 'drinking', 'so', 'much', 'quit', 'smoking', 'find', 'intangible', 'Mr', 'Right', 'opposed', 'shallow', 'serving', 'female', 'characters', 'most', 'chick', 'flicks', 'related', 'Bridget', 'best', 'sweet', 'trying', 'hardest', 'making', 'efforts', 'bumbling', 'antics', 'make', 'as', 'much', 'make', 'cry', 'knowing', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'point', 'another.In', 'classic', 'Jane', 'Austinesque', 'situation', 'one', 'male', 'just', 'happens', 'be', 'named', 'Darcy', 'top', 'Bridget', 'torn', 'two', 'men', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'mother', 'annual', 'party', 'vain', 'arrogant', 'rude', 'man', 'named', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'who', 'mother', 'pushing', 'being', 'friendly', 'When', 'one', 'insults', 'bent', 'thinking', 'what', 'terrible', 'man', 'naturally', 'Miss', 'Austin', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'pun', 'intended', 'prejudiced', 'work', 'hot', 'boss', 'slick', 'charming', 'skirt', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'when', 'usually', 'lovable', 'good', 'guy', 'roles', 'moment', 'weakness', 'Bridget', 'played', 'Who', ""n't"", 'been', 'there', 'soon', 'out', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'not', 'just', 'player', 'contrary', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'lead', 'believe', 'was', 'caught', 'mid', 'coitus', 'Mark', 'wife', 'not', 'vice', 'versa', 'great', 'scene', 'women', 'can', 'only', 'dream', 'about', 'two', 'get', 'fist', 'fight', 'streets', 'her.And', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'perfect', 'man', 'Even', 'when', 'diary', 'stabs', 'slams', 'out', 'new', 'one', 'not', 'perfect', 'Bridget', 'just', 'way', ""n't"", 'what', 'want', 'even', 'nasty', 'granny', 'panties', 'wore']",Bridget Jones's Diary

Fowler ""ben1283""","[0, 0]","The third in the line of successful British romantic comedies penned by Richard Curtis, `Bridget Jones' is thankfully a lot better than `Notting Hill' whilst never quite achieving the highs of `Four Weddings And A Funeral'.  With the books being such a success, it was only a matter of time before Bridget Jones hit the big screen.  She does it in style too, this being one of the best British movies of its type for a long while.  It tells the tale of Bridget, a thirty-something single woman looking for love - will it be the standoffish Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) or her suave boss Daniel Cleaver?  If this sounds either overly familiar or formulaic then you'd be wrong.  This is injected with enough wit, humour and fantastic performances to easily entertain for its running length.Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is effortlessly endearing in her role as Bridget, a role for which she actually gained weight for - unheard of usually.  The fact that she is such a likeable character is that Zellweger plays her with such naivety that it's hard not to sympathise with her struggles to lose weight, find a man, and get a good job.  You get the feeling that this is a real woman, not some Hollywood fantasy.  Bridget isn't perfect and therein lays her appeal.  Hugh Grant as one of her love interests is great in a role that's thankfully a good deal different from the stuttering shy Englishman that he's so used to playing.  The serious Colin Firth is also good in a role that is basically a reprisal of his Mr. Darcy in TV's `Pride And Prejudice'.  It's a credit to the film that their rivalry is played out realistically without resorting to taking sides.  The supporting cast, of course, consists of various stalwarts from television, including Celia Imrie and Sally Phillips (from the award-winning comedy `Smack The Pony').There's little to dislike here, with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and an ending that is sweet rather than sickly.  There's even attempts to bring some humanity into it all with the breakdown of Bridget's parents' marriage.  Not only is this handled sensitively, but there's also a good deal of humour packed in there too.  There's no mistaking it: Bridget Jones is a winner.",4,Great romantic comedy - that's actually funny!,1010361600,"01 7, 2002",2002,2195,"['third', 'line', 'successful', 'British', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'penned', 'Richard', 'Curtis', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'thankfully', 'lot', 'better', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'whilst', 'never', 'quite', 'achieving', 'highs', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'A', 'Funeral', 'books', 'being', 'such', 'success', 'was', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'hit', 'big', 'screen', 'style', 'too', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'British', 'movies', 'type', 'long', 'while', 'tale', 'Bridget', 'thirty-something', 'single', 'woman', 'looking', 'love', 'will', 'be', 'standoffish', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'suave', 'boss', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'overly', 'familiar', 'formulaic', 'then', ""'d"", 'be', 'wrong', 'injected', 'enough', 'wit', 'humour', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'easily', 'entertain', 'running', 'length.Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'effortlessly', 'endearing', 'role', 'Bridget', 'role', 'actually', 'gained', 'weight', 'unheard', 'usually', 'fact', 'such', 'likeable', 'character', 'Zellweger', 'such', 'naivety', 'hard', 'not', 'sympathise', 'struggles', 'lose', 'weight', 'find', 'man', 'get', 'good', 'job', 'get', 'feeling', 'real', 'woman', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'fantasy', 'Bridget', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'therein', 'appeal', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'one', 'love', 'interests', 'great', 'role', 'thankfully', 'good', 'deal', 'different', 'stuttering', 'shy', 'Englishman', 'so', 'used', 'playing', 'serious', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'also', 'good', 'role', 'basically', 'reprisal', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'TV', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'credit', 'film', 'rivalry', 'played', 'out', 'realistically', 'resorting', 'taking', 'sides', 'supporting', 'cast', 'course', 'various', 'stalwarts', 'television', 'including', 'Celia', 'Imrie', 'Sally', 'Phillips', 'award-winning', 'comedy', 'Smack', 'Pony', 'little', 'dislike', 'here', 'plenty', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'ending', 'sweet', 'rather', 'sickly', 'even', 'attempts', 'bring', 'humanity', 'breakdown', 'Bridget', 'parents', 'marriage', 'Not', 'only', 'handled', 'sensitively', 'also', 'good', 'deal', 'humour', 'packed', 'there', 'too', 'mistaking', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'winner']",Bridget Jones's Diary

Doyle ""film buff""","[3, 4]","RENEE ZELLWEGER plays such a klutzy frump of a girl in this British screwball comedy that it's hard to imagine COLIN FIRTH and HUGH GRANT fighting over her. We're told that it's because she so ""natural"" that she has men buzzing around her. Well, that might be true if Miss Zellweger looked more like Carole Lombard. In fact, one could easily see this as a screwball comedy back in the '30s if Hollywood made the story starring Lombard, Cary Grant (not Colin Firth) and James Stewart (not Hugh Grant). Get my drift? Instead, Miss Zellweger looks more like pudgy Lynn Redgrave of ""Georgy Girl,"" an overweight and rather awkward young woman given to wearing tight clothing and making the most inappropriate remarks at the most crucial moments. She speaks her mind without any regard for the consequences and lands into one troublesome social situation after another because of her quirky attitude.An inside joke has COLIN FIRTH's character called Mr. Darcy--and indeed, he behaves as that gentleman did in ""Pride and Prejudice,"" at first utterly rejecting Bridget Jones and then making a pass at her which she turns down, only to change her mind before the final reel.HUGH GRANT has a thankless role as a witless cad but plays it with his usual charm, the sort of role James Stewart might have done had this been made back in Hollywood's Golden Age when screwball comedy was just as mad but a lot less risqu&eacute;.But Renee, Colin and Hugh are not Lombard, Grant or Stewart and the film suffers because none of them can make this kind of material seem like anything more than a manipulative romantic comedy about an awkward girl finding her Prince Charming in a Jane Austen kind of way--with all the modern sensibilities destroying most of the charm.Unless you're a devoted fan of these stars, this one is pretty hard to recommend except as very lightweight entertainment in quirky British style, but Bridget's gaffes are too monumental to be accepted by Darcy.",3,Quirky heroine in modern age screwball comedy...,1222732800,"09 30, 2008",2008,1960,"['RENEE', 'ZELLWEGER', 'klutzy', 'frump', 'girl', 'British', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'hard', 'imagine', 'COLIN', 'FIRTH', 'HUGH', 'GRANT', 'fighting', ""'re"", 'told', 'so', 'natural', 'men', 'buzzing', 'Well', 'might', 'be', 'true', 'Miss', 'Zellweger', 'looked', 'more', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'fact', 'one', 'could', 'easily', 'see', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'back', ""'30s"", 'Hollywood', 'made', 'story', 'starring', 'Lombard', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'not', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'James', 'Stewart', 'not', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Get', 'drift', 'Instead', 'Miss', 'Zellweger', 'more', 'pudgy', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'Georgy', 'Girl', 'overweight', 'rather', 'awkward', 'young', 'woman', 'given', 'wearing', 'tight', 'clothing', 'making', 'most', 'inappropriate', 'remarks', 'most', 'crucial', 'moments', 'mind', 'regard', 'consequences', 'one', 'troublesome', 'social', 'situation', 'quirky', 'attitude.An', 'joke', 'COLIN', 'FIRTH', 'character', 'called', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'indeed', 'gentleman', 'did', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'first', 'utterly', 'rejecting', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'then', 'making', 'pass', 'down', 'only', 'change', 'mind', 'final', 'reel.HUGH', 'GRANT', 'thankless', 'role', 'witless', 'cad', 'usual', 'charm', 'sort', 'role', 'James', 'Stewart', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'back', 'Hollywood', 'Golden', 'Age', 'when', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'was', 'just', 'mad', 'lot', 'less', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'Renee', 'Colin', 'Hugh', 'are', 'not', 'Lombard', 'Grant', 'Stewart', 'film', 'suffers', 'none', 'can', 'make', 'kind', 'material', 'seem', 'anything', 'more', 'manipulative', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'awkward', 'girl', 'finding', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'kind', 'way', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'destroying', 'most', 'charm.Unless', ""'re"", 'devoted', 'fan', 'stars', 'one', 'pretty', 'hard', 'recommend', 'as', 'very', 'lightweight', 'entertainment', 'quirky', 'British', 'style', 'Bridget', 'gaffes', 'are', 'too', 'monumental', 'be', 'accepted', 'Darcy']",Bridget Jones's Diary

And that is what makes this movie so wonderful.Although she is an incredibly poor public speaker, Bridget is given opportunity after opportunity to prove the point.  After making an idiot of herself, at a literary party attended by the real Salman Rushdie, and Jeffry Archer, she sleeps with the boss, is royally screwed and then moves on to television.  She lands an on air job with &#8220;Sit Up Britain&#8221; because &#8220;no one at Sit Up Britain ever gets fired for shagging the boss.&#8221;  There she slides down on a fireman&#8217;s pole, exposes her barely clad derriere to the nation, and is rewarded with a plum current events assignment on human rights.Bridget&#8217;s love life is dismal.  Her mother tries to set her up with a dull lawyer Mark Darcy played with understatement by Colin Firth.  (They had to dress him in a ridiculous reindeer turtleneck sweater.  Otherwise the movie would end just five minutes after they meet.  Although gorgeous, he is just impossible to take seriously in that sweater.)  Of course, Bridget has a torrid affair with her boss, played marvelously by Hugh Grant.  He is quite the cad and ends the affair almost immediately after Bridget uses the word L word (love) in a bedroom scene.  Meanwhile, the two male leads have there own history that plays out.Bridget&#8217;s single life is attacked by friends and family.  When she goes to a dinner party by herself, she is told that her biological clock is ticking &#8220;tick tock, tick tock&#8221;, asked to why there are so many single women over age 30.  Apparently, it is open season on single women.Romantic comedy has changed a bit since Tracey and Grant, but it is still enjoyable. The casting here is perfect, as is the music.  Sharon Mcquire&#8217;s direction is superb.Timing is everything, and Renee Zellweger has impeccable comedic timing.  She also has a wonderful believable British accent.  She proves in this role that she can carry a whole movie.Although I highly recommend this dvd, I would give a word of caution.  Women will laugh first.  Some of the funniest moments may be gender specific.  It is possible that you will have to explain why that is so funny to your date.

I heard, though that this, the original, was quite good so I watched it.  It was better than the sequel but nothing to brag about.  The cast is first-rate but the plot is so silly and predictable that it doesn't give them much to work with.  Renee Zelwegger is pretty good as the pleasingly plumped-up Bridget who is in her 30's and without a man in her life.  She falls for the scoundrel Hugh Grant, who is always quite convincing as the charming cad and ignores the decent, square-jawed but boring Colin Firth.

536507,A1MHJTVNMPDBES,B00003CXT7,Ravyn,"[18, 21]","Though inspired by the A&amp;E TV mini-series &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; with Colin Firth playing a more modern Mr. Darcy in a clever bit of casting, and Hugh Grant's character inspired by Jane Austen's Mr. Wickam, there the resemblance ends. The foul mouthed, drinking and smoking Bridget, who usually can't organize her thoughts to speak coherently when called upon to do so, although she improves as the film progresses, is the direct opposite of the very eloquent Elizabeth Bennett -- also, Bridget has no sisters and has a philandering mom, who runs off with a game show host. This said, the film is very entertaining and Bridget is quite appealing, but there is far too little of the talented Colin Firth until the last third of the film. Hugh Grant is good in his role as Bridget's womanizing boss who had a falling out with Darcy.Since in the DVD making of the film featurette there is much made of the fact the book and film were inspired by the A&amp;E/BBC production of Pride &amp; Prejudice with Colin Firth as the sexy Mr. Darcy and Mark Darcy is based on Firth's portrayal and deliberately written as his modern counterpart, I couldn't watch the film without making comparisons. And that was a mistake to do because there really is little to compare except Mark Darcy is, initially, as aloof and inscrutable as Jane Austen's Mr. Darcy, if not as arrogant, and Colin Firth was deliberately cast to reprise and update his role. But it is hard to see what Mark Darcy sees in Bridget, and what attracts him to her as we never see his point of view. And unlike Elizabeth Bennet, Bridget doesn't engage him in clever verbal repartee (she's eloquent primarily in her first person narrative and diary entries), so we don't see why he falls in love with her. Firth does provide us with some more those smoldering Darcy gazes, a wonderful smile and great one-liner in the blue soup sequence and, I hope without giving too much away, a terrific kissing sequence sadly missing from Pride &amp; Prejudice. If only we had seen P&amp;P's Mr. Darcy kiss Elizabeth the same way Mark Darcy kisses Bridget.

He's as photogenic as ever, but really seemed to lack motivation. Hugh Grant was quite an interesting character with some truly hilarious lines, although I couldn't quite see that he was so horrible. As for the main character I know nothing about the actress but the character has to be one of the most stupid and embarassingly inept people I've ever seen. This is definitely a chick flick in that it seems to say that a woman can be forgiven for being mind-numbingly stupid, hopelessly incompetant and completely self-absorbed as long as she gets herself a guy. Further more, all of the above are not reason enough for her to be cheated out of her rightful due of a prince charming who loves her for being just who she is. Frankly she'd better hope he does, because it's really hard to see what other motivation anyone would have for putting up with her. One could almost forgive her for simply being really simple-minded, but her lack of dignity, social restraint, or balance make her such a complete embarrassment that it's hard to imagine wanting to be seen in public with her. This movie has only the most passing resemblance to Jane Austen's story which featured a main character who was intelligent, considerate and independent. She may have felt badly about losing marriage prospects since there weren't many other options at the time, and even been upset over losing Darcy's good opinion, but she would never have angsted in such an appalling fashion over simply being single. It's hard to imagine a bigger difference between them. This could definitely be a contender for most annoying movie of the year if I weren't aware that it would be underestimating Hollywood's capacity to turn out truly awful films.

536512,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXT7,Reviewer,"[77, 86]","Dissatisfied at age 32 with the direction her life is taking, a young woman vows to make some changes, and to keep herself on track she decides to start a daily journal, hoping it will make her toe the line, in ""Bridget Jones's Diary,"" directed by Sharon Maguire and starring Renee Zellweger.  Bridget (Zellweger) begins with some New Year's resolutions that include no more drinking or smoking, not being paranoid about her weight, and developing poise.  And-- last, but not least-- to avoid any romantic attachments to alcoholics, workaholics, peeping Toms or perverts.  Of course she promptly falls for the one man she knows who embodies all of those characteristics:  Her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).  In the meantime, her mother, Pam (Gemma Jones), continues to play matchmaker for her daughter.  At a holiday gathering of friends and family, Pam nudges her in the direction of an old childhood chum, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), now a respectable attorney, and recently divorced.  Their initial meeting, however, proves to be a less than monumental event, further complicated by the fact that Cleaver was Darcy's Best Man at his wedding, and has some tales-out-of-school to tell about the subsequently ill fated marriage that puts Darcy in a rather bad light.  But Bridget could care less; she thinks Darcy is rude and a bore, and anyway, Daniel is her guy.  Work is good, her life is going well and-- as she is about to wake up and realize-- she hasn't kept a single one of her resolutions.  And, oh! she should have.First time director Maguire proves with this auspicious debut that she certainly knows her territory and how to negotiate it.  She has the touch and the eye for detail of a seasoned professional, and her sense of timing is impeccable.  She successfully avoids a major pitfall that do in many rookie directors right out of the chute, by never fishing for the cheap, forced, disdainfully pretentious or concocted laugh.  Everything in this film, especially the humor, flows freely and naturally from the circumstances of the characters and the story, which makes it all real and believable and allows it to be readily embraced by the audience.  This is a funny, often hilarious movie, but it's also very warm and at times poignant, and for handling it so sensibly, and with such sensitivity, Maguire deserves to be granted even more kudos.  It's quite simply an exceptionally well made film, presented with a style and grace that reflects that of the director herself.Of course, having a superlative leading lady was certainly not disadvantageous to Maguire's efforts, either, and Renee Zellweger has never been better than she is here as Bridget.  With her quirky good looks, personality and charisma, she is endearing, and she invades Meryl Streep territory by affecting a perfect British accent.  Whether she's lip-syncing to a Celine Dion song, doing karaoke at an office party after having a bit too much to drink, or battling with a blender, it's easy to believe that someone would like her just the way she is.  Even with her hair mussed, or in a somewhat disheveled state, she's alluring, and it all has to do with who she is deep down inside; Zellweger makes it clear that this is a woman of substance, and it's easy to like her.  There's a down-to-earth honesty and accessibility about her that makes her appealing, and she's someone to whom many in the audience are easily going to be able to relate.  For her portrayal of Betty in ""Nurse Betty,"" Zellweger received a Golden Globe; ""Bridget"" should land her smack in the middle of Oscar territory.As Bridget's smarmy boss, Daniel, Hugh Grant turns in a noteworthy performance, putting a rather tarnished sheen on his natural charm that works so well for this character.  It's a nice departure from his usual bumbling, reserved Mr. Nice Guy routine he perfected in such films as ""Notting Hill,"" and ""Four Weddings and A Funeral.""  With this role he challenges Greg Kinnear's part in ""Someone Like You"" for the top spot in the Boss-You-Should-Never-Date category.  And Firth does a memorable turn as Darcy, fairly reprising his role of the same name in the PBS miniseries, ""Pride and Prejudice,"" from which this story is loosely derived.  Initially appearing a bit sullen, he gets the chance to develop his character as the story unfolds, and he does it quite nicely, ultimately revealing Darcy's true nature.In a supporting role, Gemma Jones gives a performance that deserves mention, doing a good job of fleshing out Bridget's mother in the brief time she is allotted.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Crispin Bonham-Carter (Greg), Jim Broadbent (Colin Jones), James Callis (Tom), Sally Phillips (Shazzer), Honor Blackman (Penny), Embeth Davidtz (Natasha), Shirley Henderson (Jude) and Celia Imrie (Una).  A warmly humorous, uplifting film, ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is a delightful and satisfying experience with more than a touch of magic in it.  Not only is it an entertaining showcase for Zellweger's many talents, but heralds the arrival of a director from whom we can expect great things in the future, Sharon Maguire.  A well crafted, reality based comedy/drama that is enjoyable and refreshingly devoid of inane nonsense or gross jokes is a rare find these days, and this is one of the best to hit the screen in a long, long time.  It's a film to be heartily embraced, and one I guarantee you'll want to see more than once.",5,Endearing Performance By Zellweger,988070400,"04 24, 2001",2001,5420,"['Dissatisfied', 'age', '32',

I've always liked her, from her initial appearance in ""Jerry Maguire"", to supporting Meryl Streep's Oscar nominated peformance in ""One True Thing"". (Everyone admires Meryl, but Renee deserved the nomination). The DVD version is loaded with out-takes & interesting stuff. Then we have the film, itself. I originally thought this might be one of those ""women's"" films and, being a fairly open-minded male, I opted for other fare. Imagine my surprise! This is a film, based on a very specific idea of a single woman's mind. Here is a woman with no idea what she's looking for, listening to her friends who are as desperate as her; to her mother, who's stuck in the 60's; to married friends who are as phony as $2 bills (or pound notes). She's clumsy, inarticulate, overweight; and totally loveable. Renee is from Texas and delivers the most perfect English accent since her former co-worker Streep (in ""French Lieutenant's Woman""). Hugh Grant is smug and more confuident than usual, and Colin Firth seems to play his part not much differently than he did as the scorned husband in ""English Patient"". Good triumphs over evil, after many misunderstandings, love triumphs over all; but it's some of the very sensitive female secret psychological moments that our Renee draws us in; she gives in to despair, drinks a lot, alone at home, and, while channel-surfing, always seems to come across a channel featuring ""animal sex"", whether lions, tigers or bears...oh my...  Overweight, neurotic and totally out-of-touch, Renee Zellweger's Bridget is among the most delightful characters I've seen in a long time. Even ""Entertainment Weekly"" judged her as a long shot for an Oscar nomination because, face it, how do you compete with Alzheimer's, mother's losing children, etc.?

(Even Liz Hurley would have trouble swallowing that one)  By half way in it is inevitable how the film will end and, unfortunately, that makes the second half of the film much less entertaining - you might find yourself checking your wristwatch (I did).  Also, there is a tremendous amount of foul language, which might lead one to expect a little subversive content, but no, there are very conservative values at the heart of this film (e.g. the two suitors are both wealthy, physically attractive and older than the eligible lady; she is shown as having no real interests aside from getting married and 'having a good time' (i.e. smoking, drinking, partying)) - the expletives are almost a disguise, so you might delude yourself that you're viewing some edgy material.  Despite these reservations, the film is saved by Renee Zellwegger who gives (a) great performance, and by the fact that the film-makers had the nerve to present a character that is flawed and fleshy - five stars for that, but not for the film overall.

(It's hard to say it's unfair when the movie's producers kept hyping this part of the movie.)&quot;BJD&quot; actually deserves plenty of praise on its basic merits -- excellent acting, witty screenplay, and great camerawork.  For those who doubt how important camerawork can be to the making of a great comedy, watch how many of the laughs in this film come from the reaction shots rather than the jokes themselves.  &quot;BJD&quot; has great writing, but there is some visual artistry in this movie that elevates it to more than a collection of funny jokes.For example, in an early scene, Bridget confronts Mark Darcy, a seemingly grim, definitely handsome attorney Bridget's mom hamfistedly tries to set up with Bridget.  While Bridget hammers on about abandoning drinking and smoking for New Year's (while clutching a cocktail and cigarette like they are life preservers), Darcy's stoic-yet-fuming reactions are priceless.The plot is pure chick-flick.  Bridget is a thirty-something singleton looking for love in the big city.  Infected with bad taste in men, she pursues her boss (and office cad), played with gleeful self awareness by Hugh Grant -- check out the glint in his eyes when we first see him, a close-up with Aretha Franklin blaring on the soundtrack.  Soon in an ill-advised romance with her boss, Bridget too late recognizes the signs that her boss is not a nice guy.While enduring the excruciatingly funny torture of her mom's affair with a walking white elephant of a man (the host of the shopping network), Bridget decides to be her own woman.  Breaking out on her own, despite some unfortunate slips of the tongue during job interviews, she finds herself marching to her own tune and eventually occupying a dream space -- with Colin Firth and Hugh Grant fighting over her (rather wimpishly, I might add) outside and through a crowded restaurant.More than a touching romance, more than a journey of personal discovery, and yet so very small and perfect, &quot;BJD&quot; is one of those great feel-good flicks that should be a chick flick, and yet is very much more.The DVD's extras are also wonderful, including a delightful set of &quot;interviews&quot; with Bridget's former boss in a bar with his succession of inadequate girlfriends.

He likes her just as she is.  And so do we, even if we think her a bit daft for taking so long to realize that he's the right man for her.But before Bridget even allows herself to admit that the proud and reserved Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) is not as bad as she thought, she's first swept away by her boss, Daniel Cleaver, played in a delightfully rakish way by Hugh Grant.  And not only does she have to sort out her feelings for Darcy and Cleaver, she also has a host of other difficulties to deal with - her parents' troubled marriage, her fondness for fatty foods, her love of drink, and her tendency to speak without thinking.Highlights of the movie include Bridget dressing up as a Playboy Bunny for what she thought was a tarts and vicars party.  Another funny scene is her in the kitchen, ineptly making blue soup and swampy-looking gravy for her birthday dinner.  Sometimes the movie did go too over the top, as in the fight scene between Cleaver and Darcy.  Also, in the DVD outtakes, I didn't see any additional scenes with Colin Firth (a pity, because he's so well-suited for such a role and so easy on the eyes...).

This is even more obvious in the respective film adaptations of the works. Colin Firth - sex symbol emerging dripping wet as Mr Darcy from the lake in the BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice returns as - yes, Mark Darcy, hunky human rights lawyer in the Bridget Jones movie. This is a Richard Curtis chick flick rom com with all the trademarks that featured in movies such as Four Weddings and a Funeral - the on/off romance, the stammering reserved Englishman, the desire to find true love, the saccharine ending, the cliched humour, young professionals in London all having far nicer appartments and more free time than they could afford in reality etc. I don't really rate Curtis as a first rate comic writer, but you have to credit his commercial awarness and his comedies do romp home at the box office.Incidentally, the best part in the film is Hugh Grant who gets all the best lines as caddish, cocky, teasing Daniel Cleaver. The main problem in the film (acknowledged by the producers) is that Daniel Cleaver is obviously the most appealing character - how many girls go for the stuck up boring lawyer over the raffish charmer?

There is something about Bridget all of us can identify with.Yes, slightly more promiscuous perhaps, maybe a bit more of a gutter-mouth but she's a character none-the-less.Bridget is full of spunk and won't let anything or anyone keep her down, and in that aspect she is a real inspiration.Mark Darcy(Colin Firth) and Daniel Cleaver(Hugh Grant) are enjoyable in there opposite of the spectrum characters, both after the affection of Miss.

536545,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00003CXT7,Steven Reynolds,"[4, 5]","A thoroughly enjoyable contemporary re-imagining of ""Pride and Prejudice"" (via Helen Fielding's novel), which is actually more faithful to the satirical spirit of Austen than many previous adaptations have been.  Ren&eacute;e Zellweger plays the introspective, thirtysomething Bridget Jones: physically, professionally and romantically dissatisfied, and saddled with a humiliating family.  The tale of her romantic and professional misadventures - and ultimate victory - will have you cringing and crying with laughter at the same time.  In any other year, Zellweger might actually have secured the Oscar for this role.  Not only did she display incredible physical commitment in mastering a British accent and packing on real pounds to play the part, she perfectly captures the endearing insecurity of the contemporary woman along with its necessary antidote - a bedrock of self-respect which has her rejecting the kind of man who thinks he can always have her (Hugh Grant), and hanging on for the one she really wants (Colin Firth).  Helen Fielding's novel has been brilliantly adapted - improved, even - thanks mainly to the peerless comic flair of co-writer Richard Curtis.  Where the book eventually slipped into a dull repetitiveness (which I suppose one could argue is deliberately emblematic of the lifestyle it portrays), the film is more focused, more funny, and knows precisely when to call it a day.  First-time director Sharon Maguire directs with remarkable confidence, revealing a great eye and ear for gags.  This is, quite simply, a perfect comedy.

I had just seen a super slim Renee in ""Chicago"" and marvel at how youthful and appealing she is with a few extra pounds.""Bridget Jones Diary"" is a chick flick that transcends the genre. The plot has the barest nod to Ms. Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" though Elizabeth Bennett would be flabbergasted to find Bridget in her role. Colin Firth actually recreates Mr. Darcy (see his fine BBC performance of P&P;) with his tongue firmly in cheek.  Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) is Bridget's wicked temptation of a faithless lover.  I must say if Hugh Grant is lovable as a dim wit comedian, he is devastating in a charming villain role.Bridget is a not-quite-featherhead, obsessively concerned with her weight, sex life and self-perceived lack of charm, looks, and luck. In her early 30's, she worries about expiring in her lonely room and being eaten by dogs. She dislikes ""smug marrieds,"" but is fearfully intimidated by them.  Bridget makes sporadic attempts to take control of her life usually with disastrous results.It took me this long to see the movie because I was lukewarm about the book.  However, Ms. Zellweger brings Bridget to life in such a way that I was instantly won over by her ditzy charm.  I fervently championed her every triumph and was saddened by her setbacks (usually brought on by herself).  This is a feel-good film and definitely worth a 120 minute investment.

Daniel decides to dump Bridget and steals Mark Darcy's wife(Lara)while Bridget discovers that Daniel ended up being unfaithful to her all of the sudden when Bridget walks into their bathroom and finds Daniel's mistress/Mark Darcy's wife(Lara)hiding in there naked, just before Daniel drops the bomb on Bridget and tells Bridget that he and Lara were even engaged to be married on top of that.So then Bridget moves on by eventually dating the British handsmome Mark Darcy(Colin Firth) after getting over a tragic divorce with Daniel, but then one night Daniel decides to drop by Bridget's apartment one night while Mark and Bridgets friends are having dinner to try to get Bridget back, since Daniel's mistress/Mark's ex-wife(Lara)ended up dumping him and breaking off their engagement resulting in Mark and Daniel duking it out in the street trying to win over Bridget while Mark also avenges Daniel for stealing his former wife(Lara)by beating the crap out of Daniel in the process after a hasty altercation, which unfortunately kinda left Bridget caught between a rock & a hard place even though Daniel ended up getting what he deserved.The truth is, I kind of couldn't help feeling kind of sorry for Daniel at first right after the ugly clash he had with Mark, since Mark nearly beat Daniel to a pulp, which also resulted in Daniel getting a double whammy in the process on top of that, but at the same time, it was like Daniel got what he deserved, since he broke Bridgets heart, but Mark did nothing to hurt Bridget or Lara and was a much bigger and better more mature gentleman than Daniel was and seemed to be a more compatible boyfriend/lover for Bridget.The end was also very touching and heartfelt when Mark drops by Bridget's apartment all of the sudden on short notice on New Years and turning down a job in New York to inform Bridget that he wants to reconcile with her and then ends up reading Bridget's diary by accident while sorting through her stuff while he's trying to find something and reads a nasty little paragraph about himself(Mark Darcy) while Bridget is freshening up to look sexy for Mark to do hubba hubba, but then Mark walks out of Bridgets apartment making us and Bridget think that Mark was leaving Bridget again after reading the nasty stuff Bridget wrote about Mark, but then it turns out that Mark wasn't going to be dumping her and that Mark just wanted to surprise her with a new diary to make a fresh start together as an item again and for Bridget to make herself a new diary starting a brand new life with Mark.Therefore, it seemed like Bridget's bloody diary lead to nothing, but trouble, injustice, and grief, kind of like how one innocent love letter lead to 6 sticky situations in the movie ""SECRET ADMIRER"".So if you're looking

Poor, unmarried women had to live as dependents and ""poor relations"", basically unpaid, if well-kept, servants.

536556,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00003CXT7,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 3]","Dear Diary,Tonight, I went to see 'Bridget Jones' Diary'. I know. I'm a guy and I didn't go with a woman. But I went. I'll confess. I went to one of the most anticipated 'chick flicks' in years without a woman. I don't know. I just feel that the whole 'chick flick', 'guy movie' thing is a disservice. If the movie is good, why shouldn't everyone see it? If the movie is bad, no one should see it. Calling 'Someone Like You' a 'chick flick' does a disservice to females. Does that mean that they like tepid, recycled cr*p? I hope not.I had a feeling I would like 'Bridget Jones' Diary', which is why I went on opening night, sitting in the middle of hundreds of women with their boyfriends and groups of female friends.I was surprised by how much I liked it.Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) is a young, single woman living in London. At 32, she begins to wonder why she can't have a meaningful relationship. She begins to wonder why she isn't married. Her mother is no help. She attempts to fix Bridget up with Mark D'Arcy (Colin Firth), a former childhood friend. Things don't go especially well and she runs into the arms of her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant). Their relationship blooms, hot and heavy, until...'Bridget Jones' Diary' is certainly not the most original movie in the world. It is pretty evident who Bridget will end up with in the end. One of the things that makes the film great is the journey. Bridget has to deal with Cleaver's boss, an older gentleman who cannot remember her name, a lecherous 'uncle', three friends, a mother and father who are having their own crisis and her own relationships with D'Arcy and Cleaver. There are a lot of funny lines in the film, lines that are that much funnier because they arise from only slightly exaggerated circumstances.Zellweger is terrific. From the moment she opens her mouth, any doubts about a Texan pulling off a convincing British accent disappear. She becomes a young British woman, and they are very different from young American women. She has the mannerisms, the tastes, the size, the accent of a young British woman. Zellweger received a Golden Globe award for 'Nurse Betty"", also a great film, and deserves another one for this role.Usually, a film with ongoing voice over sort of sends me over the edge. However, the voiceover in 'Diary' is very good. It serves to highlight points in the film, rather than bridge them and make up for a lacking narrative.Grant plays a character very different from his ultra-romantic, slightly dithering standard (see 'Four Weddings And A Funeral' and 'Notting Hill' for prime examples) and he reveals that he actually has a bit of range.Firth is a real find in this film. Usually relegated to period British films, Firth portrays a very handsome man who gets on Jones' nerves. His ability to woo Jones' provides for some very romantic moments. Zellweger and Firth are a great, romantic couple. The fact that they have to work for the relationship only adds to the authenticity of the story.Jones' mum and dad are played by Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent. Each is a very good actor, but their story seems tacked on and irrelevant. It only serves to draw us out of the main story, rather than compliment it.The third act has problems. Primarily, it goes on too long. We already know who Jones' is going to end up with, get to the scene in which it happens. The third act reminded me a bit of the television series 'Moonlighting' and the reason the series drove its viewers mad. The series took forever to get David and Maddie together. 'Diary' takes a long time to reach the inevitable.Overall, Diary, I really enjoyed 'Bridget Jones's Diary' and can't understand this whole 'chick flick' moniker it has received.

536558,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,B00003CXT7,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[1, 1]","It is a truth universally acknowledged that a film is rarely as good as the novel upon which it is based.  For one thing, it simply is not possible in 90 to 120 minutes (or in this case 98 minutes) to dramatise every incident exactly as and when it occurs in the book, nor is it ever possible to get all the humorous internal dialogue and cute thoughts that run through a character's mind.  But with a screenplay co-written by Helen Fielding (the author herself), Andrew Davies (who wrote the screenplay to Pride and Prejudice--the adaptation with Colin Firth), and Richard Curtis (The Vicar of Dibley, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Mr. Bean, Blackadder, Notting Hill) and then topped off with a terrific cast featuring Hugh Grant, who is absolutely wonderful here in the role of Bridget's bad-boy boss; and Colin Firth, in a modern-day reprisal of his signature role as Mr. Darcy--well, the stage is set for a production that just has to be good, regardless of its faithfulness (or lack thereof) to the original text.In fact, for those familiar with the novel, the film does deviate quite a bit.  Certainly, it captures the essence of the novel, and it follows its basic structure insofar as the bulk of the events that occur in the book occur also in the film.  But what occurs or what is said at these events is for the most part very different from the novel, with the character of Bridget's mom's (Gemma Jones (Duchess of Duke Street)) toy boy and thus the entire ending being completely different from the novel.I watched this film right after reading the novel, and I would definitely recommend against doing so.  If you've read the novel, let some time pass before watching the film, and then enjoy it on its own merits without expecting something that is too faithful to the text, for in spite of the deviations, this really is an cute film that is thoroughly enjoyable in its own right.  Just for the record, I've enjoyed this film much, much more upon subsequent viewings than I did initially!Briefly, for those unfamiliar with the story, it's about a 32-year-old single British woman (played surprisingly very well by American Renee Zellweger--the only non-Brit of the lot) who is looking for love but always seems to end up with commitment-phobic, game-playing losers--like her boss Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).  To make matters worse, she's surrounded by ""smug married"" friends intent on making her feel inadequate, and a mother who is intent upon fixing her up.  It is during one of those fixing-up occasions that Bridget meets the seemingly arrogant and rude Marc Darcy (Colin Firth), a highly successful lawyer and the son of her parents' friends.  From then on, Bridget seems to bump into Darcy everywhere she goes, much to her chagrin and often to her embarassment.  And that is all I shall say, for I don't wish to give things away for those unfamiliar with the story.In conclusion, I recommend this film very highly to anyone looking for a fun, light, and thoroughly enjoyable romantic comedy.  Familiarity with Pride and Prejudice is not necessary in order to enjoy this film--though one's enjoyment is bound to be greatly enhanced if one is familiar with and enjoyed the Pride and Prejudice dramatisation (which I recommend extremely highly).  After all, Colin Firth's original portrayal of Mr. Darcy was the inspiration for Fielding's Marc Darcy!",5,"An Entertaining, Light Romantic Comedy",1041724800,"01 5, 2003",2003,3369,"['truth', 'universally', 'acknowledged', 'film', 'rarely', 'as', 'good', 'novel', 'based', 'one', 'thing', 'simply', 'not', 'possible', '90', '120', 'minutes', 'case', '98', 'minutes', 'dramatise', 'incident', 'exactly', 'as', 'when', 'book', 'ever', 'possible', 'get', 'humorous', 'internal', 'dialogue', 'cute', 'thoughts', 'run', 'character', 'mind', 'screenplay', 'co-written', 'Helen', 'Fielding', 'author', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'adaptation', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Richard', 'Curtis', 'Vicar', 'Dibley', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'Blackadder', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'then', 'topped', 'off', 'terrific', 'cast', 'featuring', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'who', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'here', 'role', 'Bridget', 'bad-boy', 'boss', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'modern-day', 'reprisal', 'signature', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'well', 'stage', 'set', 'production', 'just', 'be', 'good', 'regardless', 'faithfulness', 'lack', 'thereof', 'original', 'text.In', 'fact', 'familiar', 'novel', 'film', 'deviate', 'quite', 'bit', 'Certainly', 'essence', 'novel', 'basic', 'structure', 'insofar', 'bulk', 'events', 'occur', 'book', 'occur', 'also', 'film', 'what', 'what', 'said', 'events', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'different', 'novel', 'character', 'Bridget', 'mom', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'Duchess', 'Duke', 'Street', 'toy', 'boy', 'thus', 'entire', 'ending', 'being', 'completely', 'different', 'novel.I', 'watched', 'film', 'right', 'reading', 'novel', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'doing', 'so', ""'ve"", 'read', 'novel', 'let', 'time', 'pass', 'watching', 'film', 'then', 'enjoy', 'own', 'merits', 'expecting', 'something', 'too', 'faithful', 'text', 'spite', 'deviations', 'really', 'cute', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'own', 'right', 'Just', 'record', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'film', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'upon', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'did', 'initially', 'Briefly', 'unfamiliar', 'story', '32-year-old', 'single', 'British', 'woman', 'played', 'surprisingly', 'very', 'well', 'American', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'only', 'non-Brit', 'lot', 'who', 'looking', 'love', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'commitment-phobic', 'game-playing', 'losers', 'boss', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'surrounded', 'smug', 'married', 'friends', 'intent', 'making', 'feel', 'inadequate', 'mother', 'who', 'intent', 'fixing', 'up', 'one', 'fixing-up', 'occasions', 'Bridget', 'seemingly', 'arrogant', 'rude', 'Marc', 'Darcy', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'highly', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'son', 'parents', 'friends', 'then', 'Bridget', 'bump', 'Darcy', 'everywhere', 'much', 'chagrin', 'often', 'embarassment', 'shall', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'give', 'things', 'away', 'unfamiliar', 'story.In', 'conclusion', 'recommend', 'film', 'very', 'highly', 'anyone', 'looking', 'fun', 'light', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Familiarity', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'not', 'necessary', 'order', 'enjoy', 'film', 'one', 'enjoyment', 'bound', 'be', 'greatly', 'enhanced', 'one', 'familiar', 'enjoyed', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'dramatisation', 'recommend', 'extremely', 'highly', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'original', 'portrayal', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'was', 'inspiration', 'Fielding', 'Marc', 'Darcy']",Bridget Jones's Diary

As for us girls: HG is even more attractive as the scoundrel in this movie than he is in his usual mister-nice-guy role.

As for Bridget: Rene Zellweger does a surprisingly wonderful job as the porky, chain-smoking, self-pitying british middle-class single girl who says the wrong things in the wrong places. The real weakness of this movie is that plot and  general concept seem to borrow heavily from the previous successes of this very successful British film team: Notting Hill and 4 Weddings. There is the slightly to very off-beat cast of characters, there is the odd couple getting together under the worst of circumstances as far as British social protocol is concerned, and there is the madatory happy end. In Bridget's case another weakness is that none of the characters really pulls you in and there is that spark that puts it all together.

536563,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00003CXT7,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","Last year, in my class at women's college where I teach, I quoted the name of this film, as one of the best I saw of that year; yes, I talked about this delightful romantic comedy ""Briget Jones's Diary.""  The reaction from students, all twenty-something females, was, as it turned out, pretty loud, a sort of approving ""ohhhh.""  They thought, probably, I, thirty-something MALE teacher, would not be seeing this film.Guys, (and this case, meaning males only) I say, ""Don't think that the film is made for only ""girls.""  That the film is based on Helen Fielding's bestselling books is nothing but its origin, and the film adaptation is more than what you expect, that is, more than just a descriptions of daily life of female office workers.  Not interested?  OK, you may ignore my advice, but I guess it's not a bad idea for any of us to get the inside view of vulnerable sides of those females working next to you, or walking on streets of London with their confident strides, apparently strong and independent.  And that is especially when delectable Renee Zellweger is Briget, heavy-smoking thirty-something, with no boyfriend, but with her own honest views on works, sex, and life.One day Briget Jones meets her love, or thinks she meets one, in Daniel, her boss in the publishing company she is working at.  It started with an e-mail message from him, which was  tinged with slightly sexually harrassing comment on her skirt, but, hell, who cares! when Daniel is played by typically English handsome beau Hugh Grant.  Oh, but she should have known better.Then, enters grim Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), who doesn't seem to know how to smile, who had once encountered Briget at the awful curry party (where he showed up in an eqaully awful sweater).  Behind his off-putting attitudes, however, it comes out later, there is something warm and human, but it takes time for her to learn that, and for true love to triumph.As practically every British people know, the name of ""Darcy"" is inspired by Jane Austen novel ""Pride and Prejudice,"" and in acclaimed BBC TV adaptaion of that novel, Colin Firth played the namesake Darcy, an epitome of British gentleman, grossly misunderstood by the heroine.  As this BBC production was written by Andrew Davies, who also credited as one of the co-writers of ""Briget,"" it is inevitable for us to compare those two works, and there are at several points intentional allusions to this classic book in the film.  Perhaps Firth himself may loath to be typecast, but he is no doubt suitable for the role.  So is Hugh Grant, who plays this irresponsible twit Daniel, but, actually, he played the similar character (who repeats a favorite phrase ""the thing is"") in ""An Awfully Big Adventure"" (1995) alongside with Alan Rickman.  Check out if interested.But the real treasure of the film is, as you know, Renee Zellweger, whose presence, literal and metaphorical, dominates the world of Briget Jones.  She is the one you can always relate to, male or female, and whatever she thinks or does would reveal those secret things deep in the hearts of those ""girls"" at your office, with lovely Renee always making you laugh and care for her, and if you're really working like her, most of all, look at your own life.  If you're a kind of person who wants to throw things at TV while watching ""Ally McBeal"" or ""Sex and the City,"" don't worry.  Briget's down-to-earth character would never make you.And another joy is spotting some of the celebrities; two famous writers appear at a party scene, and look for Honor Blackman, ""Bond-girl"" in ""Goldfinger,"" and the first partner of John Steed in still popular 60s British cult TV series ""Avengers.""",5,Lovely Renee in Delightful Romantic Comedy a la Jane Austen,1022284800,"05 25, 2002",2002,3666,"['Last', 'year', 'class', 'women', 'college', 'where', 'teach', 'quoted', 'name', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'saw', 'year', 'yes', 'talked', 'delightful', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Briget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'reaction', 'students', 'twenty-something', 'females', 'was', 'turned', 'out', 'pretty', 'loud', 'sort', 'approving', 'ohhhh', 'thought', 'probably', 'thirty-something', 'MALE', 'teacher', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'seeing', 'film.Guys', 'case', 'meaning', 'males', 'only', 'say', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'made', 'only', 'girls', 'film', 'based', 'Helen', 'Fielding', 'bestselling', 'books', 'nothing', 'origin', 'film', 'adaptation', 'more', 'what', 'expect', 'more', 'just', 'descriptions', 'daily', 'life', 'female', 'office', 'workers', 'Not', 'interested', 'OK', 'may', 'ignore', 'advice', 'guess', 'not', 'bad', 'idea', 'get', 'inside', 'view', 'vulnerable', 'sides', 'females', 'working', 'next', 'walking', 'streets', 'London', 'confident', 'strides', 'apparently', 'strong', 'independent', 'especially', 'when', 'delectable', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Briget', 'heavy-smoking', 'thirty-something', 'boyfriend', 'own', 'honest', 'views', 'works', 'sex', 'life.One', 'day', 'Briget', 'Jones', 'love', 'one', 'Daniel', 'boss', 'publishing', 'company', 'working', 'started', 'e-mail', 'message', 'was', 'tinged', 'slightly', 'sexually', 'harrassing', 'comment', 'skirt', 'hell', 'who', 'when', 'Daniel', 'played', 'typically', 'English', 'handsome', 'beau', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Oh', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better.Then', 'enters', 'grim', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'how', 'smile', 'who', 'had', 'once', 'encountered', 'Briget', 'awful', 'curry', 'party', 'where', 'showed', 'up', 'eqaully', 'awful', 'sweater', 'off-putting', 'attitudes', 'however', 'out', 'later', 'something', 'warm', 'human', 'time', 'learn', 'true', 'love', 'triumph.As', 'practically', 'British', 'people', 'know', 'name', 'Darcy', 'inspired', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'acclaimed', 'BBC', 'TV', 'adaptaion', 'novel', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'played', 'namesake', 'Darcy', 'epitome', 'British', 'gentleman', 'grossly', 'misunderstood', 'heroine', 'BBC', 'production', 'was', 'written', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'who', 'also', 'credited', 'one', 'co-writers', 'Briget', 'inevitable', 'compare', 'two', 'works', 'are', 'several', 'points', 'intentional', 'allusions', 'classic', 'book', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'Firth', 'may', 'loath', 'be', 'typecast', 'doubt', 'suitable', 'role', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'who', 'irresponsible', 'twit', 'Daniel', 'actually', 'played', 'similar', 'character', 'who', 'favorite', 'phrase', 'thing', 'Awfully', 'Big', 'Adventure', '1995', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Check', 'real', 'treasure', 'film', 'know', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'presence', 'literal', 'metaphorical', 'world', 'Briget', 'Jones', 'one', 'can', 'always', 'relate', 'male', 'female', 'would', 'reveal', 'secret', 'things', 'deep', 'hearts', 'girls', 'office', 'lovely', 'Renee', 'always', 'making', 'laugh', 'care', ""'re"", 'really', 'working', 'most', 'look', 'own', 'life', ""'re"", 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'throw', 'things', 'TV', 'watching', 'Ally', 'McBeal', 'Sex', 'City', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'Briget', 'down-to-earth', 'character', 'would', 'never', 'make', 'you.And', 'joy', 'spotting', 'celebrities', 'two', 'famous', 'writers', 'appear', 'party', 'scene', 'look', 'Honor', 'Blackman', 'Bond-girl', 'Goldfinger', 'first', 'partner', 'John', 'Steed', 'still', 'popular', '60s', 'British', 'cult', 'TV', 'series', 'Avengers']",Bridget Jones's Diary

After reading the book, I was quite disappointed and had no intention of seeing the movie. Several months later I have finally watched the film and I must admit I was really surprised. Very seldom does a film work better than the literary counterpart than it is based upon. Usually a film either matches the spirit of the original work or falls way short and does a discredit to the text it was based upon. BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY is a film that surpasses the book it is based upon. The movie flows much better than the novel and the characters are much more vivid and lifelike (well, Bridget's friends are toned down to a two-dimensionality, but most of them are worse scoundrels than Bridget).Renee Zellweger pulls off a wonderful performance as the title character. It's hard to believe that the actress portraying this British singleton is actually an American, and not only that but a Texan to boot. Zellweger gives an emotional attachment to the character of Bridget Jones that is lacking in the novel. The character from the book is someone that is just as cruel and careless as most of the people she meets and encounters. However, the character in the film is someone that forms an attachment with the audience, someone that is likeable, someone that we cares what happens to.Hugh Grant is perfect as the slimy boss, Daniel Cleever, and Colin Firth is perfect as Marc Darcy.The language in the film isn't as vulgar as would be expected and the sexuality isn't as bad as it could have been either.

536565,A16GAIJJE39T1S,B00003CXT7,Ulfilas,"[0, 0]","One of the things that continues to amaze me about good actors is the transformation they undergo as they assume a role.  My wife once made the observation that I found Renee Zellweger really attractive.  As I tried to explain, however, it is not Ms. Zellweger the person or the woman who I find attractive--although it may be a character that she opts to play.  The horribly mercenary woman that she played in ""Chicago"" was ghastly--and also really too skinny.  I liked her in ""Jerry McGuire"" and ""Nurse Betty""--but in ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" she really hit her stride--at least as far as I am concerned!  I am not talking as if I imagine myself to be be a film connaisseur--I just know what I like and what I find attractive--and the character that Ms. Zellweger embodies in this movie seems truly wonderful to me.  The Yiddish word ""Zaftig"" (i.e. juicy) conveys for me what might be called the ""well-fed farm girl look"" that Ms. Zellweger has achieved here.  And I can't say that this is my ideal concept of feminine beauty--but in this case it just seems to work!  I loved her awkward introduction of Salmon Rushdie at a publisher's event, as well as her confused appearance at a party dressed as a Playboy bunny because somebody had erroneously informed her that the theme would be the ever-fascinating ""Vicars and Tarts"".  Not all of Bridget's tastes appeal to me.  Smoking--forget it!  And tiger striped panties are not what I would consider ""sexy knickers"".  But her inappropriate frankness and endearing insecurity are traits that I find strangely attractive.  As Colin Firth's character said, here is what I would change about her: nothing (except for the smoking).",5,Renee Zellweger is charming as the zaftig but insecure Bridget,1305936000,"05 21, 2011",2011,1675,"['One', 'things', 'amaze', 'good', 'actors', 'transformation', 'undergo', 'assume', 'role', 'wife', 'once', 'made', 'observation', 'found', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'really', 'attractive', 'tried', 'explain', 'however', 'not', 'Ms.', 'Zellweger', 'person', 'woman', 'who', 'find', 'attractive', 'may', 'be', 'character', 'play', 'horribly', 'mercenary', 'woman', 'played', 'Chicago', 'was', 'ghastly', 'also', 'really', 'too', 'skinny', 'liked', 'Jerry', 'McGuire', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'really', 'hit', 'stride', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'am', 'not', 'talking', 'imagine', 'be', 'be', 'film', 'connaisseur', 'just', 'know', 'what', 'like', 'what', 'find', 'attractive', 'character', 'Ms.', 'Zellweger', 'movie', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'Yiddish', 'word', 'Zaftig', 'i.e', 'juicy', 'conveys', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'called', 'well-fed', 'farm', 'girl', 'look', 'Ms.', 'Zellweger', 'achieved', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'ideal', 'concept', 'feminine', 'beauty', 'case', 'just', 'work', 'loved', 'awkward', 'introduction', 'Salmon', 'Rushdie', 'publisher', 'event', 'as', 'well', 'confused', 'appearance', 'party', 'dressed', 'Playboy', 'bunny', 'somebody', 'had', 'erroneously', 'informed', 'theme', 'would', 'be', 'ever-fascinating', 'Vicars', 'Tarts', 'Not', 'Bridget', 'tastes', 'appeal', 'Smoking', 'forget', 'tiger', 'striped', 'panties', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'sexy', 'knickers', 'inappropriate', 'frankness', 'endearing', 'insecurity', 'are', 'find', 'strangely', 'attractive', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'character', 'said', 'here', 'what', 'would', 'change', 'nothing', 'smoking']",Bridget Jones's Diary

The fault lies not with Renee Zellweger with her flawless performance but perhaps with the script or direction or the failure of Colin Firth to convince the viewer of the transformation that takes place that draws him to Bridget - as I said it happens as a requirement of the plot.But for me this was only a minor flaw in what was otherwise an entertaining film.  The various plot sequences - really character development sketches are on the whole well done. The emotional feelings of Bridget to her evolving situation are enhanced with a skillful choice of songs.  For me it was the use of music that raised this to a 4 star production.Poor use was made of the two outstanding performers Jim Broadbent and Shirley Henderson (&quot;Yum-Yum&quot; in Topsy Turvy) in what could only be called minor roles.

I have to admit I laughed harder reading the novel than while watching the film but I found the movie endearing in its own right.Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) is a bumbling British woman who at the age of 30 or so has decided that she is turning into a spinster. Her friends and family make every effort to find her a mate but only end up embarrassing her more than she is capable of on her own. Jones is secretly in love with her hunky but totally unavailable boss (Hugh Grant) and spends an enormous amount of time trying to get his attention. Along the way she meets a family acquaintance Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) and they play back and forth at a serious stab at a relationship. All the while Jones writes down in a red diary all of the escapades she encounters as well as her obsession with her weight thus leaving a trail of words in her wake that could come back to bite her.Renee Zellweger has successfully managed to become British for her role as Bridget Jones. Much has been made about her weight in this movie but in reality she is still slimmer than the average American woman even though she is supposed to possess ""enormous underwear"" Zellweger has excellent comic skills and hits this character on the head but unfortunately the director left some of Helen Fielding's funniest written scenes out of this movie. Hugh Grant is perfect as a cad but somehow still lovable. Colin Firth is so appealing as Mark Darcy and the friction between him and Zellweger works as beautifully as a romantic comedy should. Overall this movie is fun and entertaining capturing all of the awkwardness felt by those of us who never quite fit into this world so bent on perfection and leaving us with someone else to laugh at besides ourselves for a change.",4,This Diary is Worth Reading!,1100044800,"11 10, 2004",2004,1870,"['loved', 'Helen', 'Fielding', 'novel', 'will', 'find', 'similarities', 'differences', 'film', 'version', 'story', 'have', 'admit', 'laughed', 'harder', 'reading', 'novel', 'watching', 'film', 'found', 'movie', 'endearing', 'own', 'right.Bridget', 'Jones', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'bumbling', 'British', 'woman', 'who', 'age', '30', 'so', 'decided', 'turning', 'spinster', 'friends', 'family', 'make', 'effort', 'find', 'mate', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'embarrassing', 'more', 'capable', 'own', 'Jones', 'secretly', 'love', 'hunky', 'totally', 'unavailable', 'boss', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'enormous', 'amount', 'time', 'trying', 'get', 'attention', 'way', 'family', 'acquaintance', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'play', 'back', 'forth', 'serious', 'stab', 'relationship', 'while', 'Jones', 'down', 'red', 'diary', 'escapades', 'as', 'well', 'obsession', 'weight', 'thus', 'leaving', 'trail', 'words', 'wake', 'could', 'come', 'back', 'bite', 'her.Renee', 'Zellweger', 'successfully', 'managed', 'become', 'British', 'role', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Much', 'been', 'made', 'weight', 'movie', 'reality', 'still', 'slimmer', 'average', 'American', 'woman', 'even', 'supposed', 'possess', 'enormous', 'underwear', 'Zellweger', 'excellent', 'comic', 'skills', 'character', 'head', 'unfortunately', 'director', 'left', 'Helen', 'Fielding', 'funniest', 'written', 'movie', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'perfect', 'cad', 'somehow', 'still', 'lovable', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'so', 'appealing', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'friction', 'Zellweger', 'as', 'beautifully', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'should', 'Overall', 'movie', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'capturing', 'awkwardness', 'felt', 'who', 'never', 'quite', 'fit', 'world', 'so', 'bent', 'perfection', 'leaving', 'someone', 'else', 'laugh', 'besides', 'ourselves', 'change']",Bridget Jones's Diary

Renee Zellweger turns in a memorable performance as Bridget an unmarried career woman still looking for Mr. Right in all the wrong places. Suddenly, she has two possible suitors. Her cad of a boss (Hugh Grant) who's probably all wrong for her but feels so right and a human rights lawyer (Colin Firth)who feels all wrong but is probably right for her. Her misadventures with both men will immediately win you over.Now that we've got the plot and review out of the way I'm going to focus on what's different between this edition and the previous one. The first DVD released in 2001 and this one released to coincide with the sequel ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"" look exactly the same. There's nothing to distinguish one disc vs. another. Also, many of the special features are the same as well and, contrary to the amazon.com summary, many of these were on the original release as well.The new edition features a handful of new featurettes. Jenny Bicks a writer/producer on ""Sex and the City"",  the editor of Allure Magazine and others comment on the difficulties in our narcissistic society. Her comments on finding Mr. Right in a world of Mr. Wrongs are frequently on target and quite funny. It's a standard but occasionally clever featurette that weaves clips from the movie with special footage highlighting the difficulty of finding the right person in a  society. ""The Bridget Phenomenon"" focuses on Bridget herself-Helen Fielding. Well, actually according to Helen and the film's director Sharon McGuire Helen really isn't Bridgett. She just assumed her identity for the famous columns she wrote. Interviews with the cast members discussing the perception that being single is full of woe. Fielding discusses the great appeal of Bridget lies in the gap of how their expected to be and how they actually are. ""Portrait of the Make Up Artist"" focuses on Graham Johnston the chief make up artist on ""Bridget Jones Diary"" and the newly released sequel. All the other featurettes and Special Features appeared on the first edition of this funny comedy with the exception of ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"" trailer. There's also reviews of the first film on this disc.The original release had the feature commentary by director Sharon Maguire, the behind-the-scenes featurette on the making of the movie, deleted scenes. Contrary to the listing here the original Bridget Jones' Diary Columns appeared on the first disc as well. Missing from the new edition are the music videos. That's about it. The film sounds and looks exactly the same as the previous edition.If you haven't purchased the film before or rented it on video but didn't buy the DVD, this new edition is worthwhile picking up.

536571,A1YQS7S1IE53SB,B00003CXT7,Wendy C. Rigney,"[3, 3]","Much had been made back when Ren&eacute;e Zellweger landed the role of one of England's most recent iconic characters, Bridget Jones, a thirtysomething woman looking for love while dealing with her job, wacky parents, well-meaning yet misguided friends, and of course, the perils of her love life. Yet Ms. Zellweger pulled off Bridget flawlessly.Yes, Bridget is not the prototype of the Independent Woman. And I think it is on purpose. The movie, in my opinion, is about not being perfect but struggling to accept the flaws all women have, so exaggeration can be handy in that regard. And poor Bridget does have her moments, from dinner parties with Smug Marrieds to bunny suits to caddish but handsome bosses that she knows she should avoid, yet cannot stay away from. What woman has not been attracted to the ""wrong"" man despite their better judgment?Speaking of the caddish boss, Hugh Grant seemed to have loads of fun once he got to shed the stumbling, bumbling persona he is usually known for in his other roles. Daniel Cleaver is slick, smooth, and uses his good looks to entice Bridget - and a lot of other women. And he loves the thrill of the chase. He is not, however, honest and faithful, something that Bridget finds out in a most humiliating way, which leads to...Colin Firth's Mark Darcy. As many likely know, Mark and Bridget's first meeting and subsequent relationship is based on Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"". Both Mark and Bridget are pressured by their respective parents to meet at the annual New Year's shindig, the turkey curry buffet, where Mark is rude to Bridget and insults her. From that point on, Bridget dislikes Mark, as well. Yet wherever Bridget is - be it a disastrous book launch party, staying at the same getaway spot as her and Daniel, or at that same Smug Marrieds dinner party - he is there, and always seems to catch Bridget at her most humiliating. (Perhaps this is what makes his declaration after said dinner party all the more endearing.) Colin Firth, on the surface, has the most thankless role as Mark Darcy, who is more severe and staid. But, like with the original story of P&P; - a production he starred in and, of course - inspired Ms. Fielding to model Mark after - the metamorphosis is great. Colin Firth can say more with a small smile or with his eyes. But between Mark's aforementioned declaration, his helping Bridget out professionally [check out their faces during the courtroom interview scene], and being Bridget's white knight again at Bridget's own birthday dinner, it becomes apparent there is more to Mark beneath the surface, as Bridget comes to realize - almost too late. But, as it is a movie, she does - and the final scenes, to me, put the ""romantic"" in romantic comedy. And Zellweger and Firth had fabulous chemistry. As did Grant/Zellweger. So there are no complaints in the romance area to be had. (Firth/Grant were also hilarious and had great antagonistic chemistry as rivals.)As for the comedy part? Check out the much-discussed Daniel/Mark fight scene! Hilarious. Only they can halt the almost girl-like fighting to sing happy birthday. (And there is a similar fight in the sequel involving a fountain. Thus showing TPTB knew the first fight was classic enough to do a retread!) Add in Bridget's flighty mother and chronically bemused/depressed father, and the laughs keep coming.Bridget's friends offer a nice framework for the laughs as well as heart - even if they are sadly underused here versus the book, but at ninety minutes, it is inevitable that some things from the book get short shrift in the movie. That said, Sally Phillips as Sharon/""Shazza"" was a riot.If you're looking for a movie where the heroine is self assured and is confident in herself without needing anyone else? This is NOT the movie for you. Ms. Fielding and those who wrote the movie seemed to like to mock all of the insecurities with weight, sex, and families that women moan about (thus making Bridget sort of an ""Every Woman"") and, for comedy's sake, it is much more exaggerated in the film than in the book. Bridget does get herself in some uncomfortable spots. But, despite her pratfalls, she does pick herself up - after moping, as some do - and carries on. But since the movie deals largely with her torn between two men, she is not the role model for the modern woman, although it is what Bridget WISHES she was, hence the smart irony of it all.That said, if you are NOT looking for some deep meaning and just want some romance with a dose of comedy to chase the blues away? Sit back, grab the ice cream and/or a glass of wine, and enjoy!",5,A romantic comedy with actual comedy!,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,4609,"['Much', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'back', 'when', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'landed', 'role', 'one', 'England', 'most', 'recent', 'iconic', 'characters', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'thirtysomething', 'woman', 'looking', 'love', 'dealing', 'job', 'wacky', 'parents', 'well-meaning', 'yet', 'misguided', 'friends', 'course', 'perils', 'love', 'life', 'Ms.', 'Zellweger', 'pulled', 'off', 'Bridget', 'flawlessly.Yes', 'Bridget', 'not', 'prototype', 'Independent', 'Woman', 'think', 'purpose', 'movie', 'opinion', 'not', 'being', 'perfect', 'struggling', 'accept', 'flaws', 'women', 'have', 'exaggeration', 'can', 'be', 'handy', 'regard', 'poor', 'Bridget', 'have', 'moments', 'dinner', 'parties', 'Smug', 'Marrieds', 'bunny', 'suits', 'caddish', 'handsome', 'bosses', 'should', 'avoid', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'stay', 'away', 'What', 'woman', 'not', 'been', 'attracted', 'wrong', 'man', 'better', 'judgment', 'Speaking', 'caddish', 'boss', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'seemed', 'have', 'loads', 'fun', 'got', 'shed', 'stumbling', 'bumbling', 'persona', 'usually', 'known', 'other', 'roles', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'slick', 'smooth', 'good', 'looks', 'entice', 'Bridget', 'lot', 'other', 'women', 'thrill', 'chase', 'not', 'however', 'honest', 'faithful', 'something', 'Bridget', 'out', 'most', 'humiliating', 'way', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'many', 'likely', 'know', 'Mark', 'Bridget', 'first', 'meeting', 'subsequent', 'relationship', 'based', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Mark', 'Bridget', 'are', 'pressured', 'respective', 'parents', 'meet', 'annual', 'New', 'Year', 'shindig', 'turkey', 'curry', 'buffet', 'where', 'Mark', 'rude', 'Bridget', 'insults', 'point', 'Bridget', 'Mark', 'well', 'wherever', 'Bridget', 'be', 'disastrous', 'book', 'launch', 'party', 'staying', 'same', 'getaway', 'spot', 'Daniel', 'same', 'Smug', 'Marrieds', 'dinner', 'party', 'there', 'always', 'catch', 'Bridget', 'most', 'humiliating', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'declaration', 'said', 'dinner', 'party', 'more', 'endearing', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'surface', 'most', 'thankless', 'role', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'who', 'more', 'severe', 'staid', 'original', 'story', 'P', 'P', 'production', 'starred', 'course', 'inspired', 'Ms', 'Fielding', 'model', 'Mark', 'metamorphosis', 'great', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'can', 'say', 'more', 'small', 'smile', 'eyes', 'Mark', 'aforementioned', 'declaration', 'helping', 'Bridget', 'out', 'professionally', '[', 'check', 'out', 'courtroom', 'interview', 'scene', ']', 'being', 'Bridget', 'white', 'knight', 'again', 'Bridget', 'own', 'birthday', 'dinner', 'apparent', 'more', 'Mark', 'surface', 'Bridget', 'realize', 'almost', 'too', 'late', 'movie', 'final', 'scenes', 'put', 'romantic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Zellweger', 'Firth', 'had', 'fabulous', 'chemistry', 'did', 'Grant/Zellweger', 'are', 'complaints', 'romance', 'area', 'be', 'had', 'Firth/Grant', 'were', 'also', 'hilarious', 'had', 'great', 'antagonistic', 'chemistry', 'rivals', 'comedy', 'part', 'Check', 'out', 'much-discussed', 'Daniel/Mark', 'fight', 'scene', 'Hilarious', 'Only', 'can', 'halt', 'almost', 'girl-like', 'fighting', 'sing', 'happy', 'birthday', 'similar', 'fight', 'sequel', 'involving', 'fountain', 'Thus', 'showing', 'TPTB', 'knew', 'first', 'fight', 'was', 'classic', 'enough', 'do', 'retread', 'Add', 'Bridget', 'flighty', 'mother', 'chronically', 'bemused/depressed', 'father', 'laughs', 'keep', 'coming.Bridget', 'friends', 'offer', 'nice', 'framework', 'laughs', 'as', 'well', 'heart', 'even', 'are', 'sadly', 'underused', 'here', 'book', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'inevitable', 'things', 'book', 'get', 'short', 'shrift', 'movie', 'said', 'Sally', 'Phillips', 'Sharon/', 'Shazza', 'was', 'riot.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'where', 'heroine', 'self', 'assured', 'confident', 'needing', 'anyone', 'else', 'NOT', 'movie', 'Ms', 'Fielding', 'who', 'wrote', 'movie', 'seemed', 'like', 'mock', 'insecurities', 'weight', 'sex', 'families', 'women', 'moan', 'thus', 'making', 'Bridget', 'sort', 'Woman', 'comedy', 'sake', 'much', 'more', 'exaggerated', 'film', 'book', 'Bridget', 'get', 'uncomfortable', 'spots', 'pratfalls', 'pick', 'up', 'moping', 'do', 'movie', 'deals', 'largely', 'torn', 'two', 'men', 'not', 'role', 'model', 'modern', 'woman', 'what', 'Bridget', 'WISHES', 'was', 'smart', 'irony', 'said', 'are', 'NOT', 'looking', 'deep', 'meaning', 'just', 'want', 'romance', 'dose', 'comedy', 'chase', 'blues', 'away', 'Sit', 'back', 'grab', 'ice', 'cream', 'glass', 'wine', 'enjoy']",Bridget Jones's Diary
536572,A18M68DE1Y6W51,B00003CXT7,Wendy Kaplan,"[7, 8]","Renee Zellweger IS Bridget Jones, in my opinion, perhaps because I saw the movie before I read the book. Who else can convey Bridget's myriad and truly unique emotions with a simple roll of the eyes and a lift of the eyebrow? She makes us love her as she struggles with her &quot;singleton&quot; life as a 30s-something Brit who just can't quite get anything right.Having watched the movie again AFTER reading the book, I was even more enchanted with her wonderful performance. And of course the addition of Colin Firth as an updated Mister Darcy, parodying his own performance as the haughty and brooding Darcy in the BBC version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; is simply too delicious to miss. As Bridget devotees know, Bridget and her girlfriends have quite an obsession with Mr. Firth...and he plays along with the joke without once letting us down.It is Hugh Grant, however, who gave me pause. Hugh plays Hugh, as he always does, but this time he's the villain, if you will--Bridget's faithless and rotten boss Daniel, who loves her and leaves her a number of times. I just couldn't quite see Hugh as the bad guy, and he did not, to my mind, resemble the nasty user in the book. On the other hand, I always find him a delight, so this weakness did not ruin the movie for me.For those who like their movies to be absolute replicas of the book, this is not the one to watch. Rather, it is a delightful, fast-paced and maybe a little bit frenzied hodgepodge of bits and pieces of the book, with a little more thrown in. Some memorable parts of the book, such as Bridget's battle with the &quot;nasty underpants,&quot; are taken out of context, but still very funny. The book's gentle parody of Pride and Prejudice is still in evidence, and very funny, thanks to the above-mentioned deadpan performance by Firth. Bridget is no Elizabeth Bennett, but the whole thing works, somehow, just as it did in the book.This is the kind of movie to pop into the VCR whilst drinking a bottle of wine with one's girlfriends in front of the telly.
