The movie takes you on an incredible journey from the peaceful side of man to his violent war atrocities. This has got to be one of the best films ever made about the Second World War and wars in general.  It is also a cinematically beautiful love story, and features one of the most beautifully photographed love scenes ever put on film. The story of two children from entirely different cultures thrown together by chance is wonderfully told by brilliant scenes filled with innocence, humor and sentiment. Rarely have I seen such chemistry between two child actors as in this film. The acting is suberb. The idea of maps as a guides into our hearts to tell the story is original and facinating. I am so glad this film is availble on DVD now that my old VHS tape is starting to show signs of lots of wear. It's one of so few films that one can watch numerous times and always come away with new ideas and nuances.

341018,A2FTHCGH06O4Y5,6302859344,Caraculiambro,"[21, 22]","The five stars are for the movie, not necessarily the DVD, which, after an inexplicable wait, has finally arrived on shelves.  I'll leave it to others to talk about the movie itself; I'll just make a few points about the DVD.First of all, you should be aware that this is the European edit, not the American one, which for reasons unknown to me was not the version chosen for the DVD transfer.  The American version runs about 109 minutes, the European PAL version about 5 minutes longer.  There are a couple of scenes that until now only the Europeans could see (for example, after Walter tells Albertine, ""I'd do anything for you,"" he takes her into the next room where he has secreted a horse into their apartment!).  Now this is included.  Another difference that will be immediately noticeable is that the voice of Avik and Albertine's daughter is no longer voiced over with that sweet and mellifluous voice, but is now the raucous and heavily accented voice of the actress you see:  quite jarring if you've never heard it before.  In addition, the European version was much more leisurely with the editing pace (such as during the interview between Avik's daughter and him on the snow:  there are many extra lines now), with longer establishing shots, Avik nearly getting run over by a snowplow, etc., and this more relaxed pace has been preserved.THE GOOD:1.  ""Map of the Human Heart"" was not filmed in 1.85:1 as I long thought, but full widescreen, 2.35:1, and provided your player is set up to play it, this DVD will play the full ""dollar"".  This is not, however, the tremendous experience rabid fans of this movie might think it is, since I feel director Vincent Ward didn't really use that extra space off to the sides, so you haven't been missing much.  As far as I know, ONLY widescreen is available, and no ""fullscreen"" version of this movie is even offered on DVD.  The version you would purchase from this page (ASIN: B0001MDQ58) is letterbox, though Amazon doesn't make that clear.2.  The deleted scenes are interesting but frankly I understand why they wound up on the cutting room floor.  There are only four included.  I happen to know of a couple of other deleted scenes which were filmed but haven't made it on this disc:  Avik in a POW-type convoy after Dresden, and Walter searching among the overturned tables and chairs for the missing Albertine (!) during the final dream sequence with the air balloon.  However, I was dumbfounded at the urination sequence!THE BAD:1.  I was hoping that the subtitles would clarify some lines I've always wondered about, but instead they were poorly done -- evidently by somebody who was in a great hurry or who simply didn't care.  Just a couple of irritating examples:  When Avik bombs Dresden, the subtitles have him saying, ""We are on target,"" instead of, ""What have I done?""  Or when Jeanne Moureau as the imperious nun rips the sheet off the two kids, the subtitles have her saying, ""The worn skin only stands so much damage,"" instead of ""The walls can only stand so much damage,"" referring to the kids' hijinks in a scene that didn't make the final cut.  Subtitles are also available in Spanish (with the same errors), but not in any other language.2.  There is no commentary or any kind of interview with the director, Ward, or anybody else, such as Louis Nowra or Gabriel Yared.  This was a disappointment, even though the quality of Ward's voiceover on the ""What Dreams May Come"" DVD is less than tremendous (he in fact reads most of it).",5,the DVD is finally here,1086652800,"06 8, 2004",2004,3508,"['five', 'stars', 'are', 'movie', 'not', 'necessarily', 'DVD', 'inexplicable', 'wait', 'finally', 'arrived', 'shelves', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'others', 'talk', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'just', 'make', 'few', 'points', 'DVD.First', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'European', 'edit', 'not', 'American', 'one', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'was', 'not', 'version', 'chosen', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'American', 'version', '109', 'minutes', 'European', 'PAL', 'version', '5', 'minutes', 'longer', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'now', 'only', 'Europeans', 'could', 'see', 'example', 'Walter', 'Albertine', ""'d"", 'do', 'anything', 'next', 'room', 'where', 'secreted', 'horse', 'apartment', 'Now', 'included', 'difference', 'will', 'be', 'immediately', 'noticeable', 'voice', 'Avik', 'Albertine', 'daughter', 'no', 'longer', 'voiced', 'sweet', 'mellifluous', 'voice', 'now', 'raucous', 'heavily', 'accented', 'voice', 'actress', 'see', 'quite', 'jarring', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'addition', 'European', 'version', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'leisurely', 'editing', 'pace', 'such', 'interview', 'Avik', 'daughter', 'snow', 'are', 'many', 'extra', 'lines', 'now', 'longer', 'establishing', 'shots', 'Avik', 'nearly', 'getting', 'run', 'over', 'snowplow', 'etc.', 'more', 'relaxed', 'pace', 'been', 'preserved.THE', 'GOOD:1', 'Map', 'Human', 'Heart', 'was', 'not', 'filmed', '1.85:1', 'long', 'thought', 'full', 'widescreen', '2.35:1', 'provided', 'player', 'set', 'up', 'play', 'DVD', 'will', 'play', 'full', 'dollar', 'not', 'however', 'tremendous', 'experience', 'rabid', 'fans', 'movie', 'might', 'think', 'feel', 'director', 'Vincent', 'Ward', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'use', 'extra', 'space', 'sides', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'missing', 'much', 'As', 'far', 'know', 'ONLY', 'widescreen', 'available', 'fullscreen', 'version', 'movie', 'even', 'offered', 'DVD', 'version', 'would', 'purchase', 'page', 'ASIN', 'B0001MDQ58', 'letterbox', 'Amazon', ""n't"", 'make', 'clear.2', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'interesting', 'frankly', 'understand', 'why', 'wound', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'are', 'only', 'four', 'included', 'happen', 'know', 'couple', 'other', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'have', ""n't"", 'made', 'disc', 'Avik', 'POW-type', 'convoy', 'Dresden', 'Walter', 'searching', 'overturned', 'tables', 'chairs', 'missing', 'Albertine', 'final', 'dream', 'sequence', 'air', 'balloon', 'However', 'was', 'dumbfounded', 'urination', 'sequence', 'BAD:1', 'was', 'hoping', 'subtitles', 'would', 'clarify', 'lines', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wondered', 'instead', 'were', 'poorly', 'done', 'evidently', 'somebody', 'who', 'was', 'great', 'hurry', 'who', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Just', 'couple', 'irritating', 'examples', 'When', 'Avik', 'Dresden', 'subtitles', 'have', 'saying', 'are', 'target', 'instead', 'What', 'have', 'done', 'when', 'Jeanne', 'Moureau', 'imperious', 'nun', 'sheet', 'two', 'kids', 'subtitles', 'have', 'saying', 'worn', 'skin', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'damage', 'instead', 'walls', 'can', 'only', 'stand', 'so', 'much', 'damage', 'referring', 'kids', 'hijinks', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'final', 'cut', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'also', 'available', 'Spanish', 'same', 'errors', 'not', 'other', 'language.2', 'commentary', 'kind', 'interview', 'director', 'Ward', 'anybody', 'else', 'such', 'Louis', 'Nowra', 'Gabriel', 'Yared', 'was', 'disappointment', 'even', 'quality', 'Ward', 'voiceover', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'DVD', 'less', 'tremendous', 'fact', 'most']",N/A
341019,A2YXMN40D7WTGP,6302859344,casualsuede,"[14, 15]","Being an ex-pat Canadian, I was sort of suspicious of this movie and  wondered if it would capture the heart and soul of Northern Arctic  Canada.After all, the director is from New Zealand and among the leads,  there are two American's, One Irish, Two French people....Not a Canadian  among them!However, my fears were put to rest in the opening 10 minutes  of this movie....The main character is a boy named Avik, who is a half  Inuit/Caucasian boy.  He has no mother or father and is being raised by his  grandmother who loves him dearly.  He life is changed one day when a great  bird lands in their tribal lands and produces a Cartographer named Walter  Russell.  The bird of course is a Plane and in 1931, no Inuit has ever seen  this before and are naturally suspicious of it.  However, Avik is not and  this magnificent sight changes his life forever.  Russell is staying with  the Inuit tribe as he maps their region for world maps.  However, he finds  out that Avik develops Tuberculosis (the white man's disease) and take's  him back to Montreal for treatment at a Catholic Hospital.There, he  meets Albertine, who is half Indian/Caucasian and this similarity of being  a &quot;half-breed&quot; draws them together.  As their friendship blossoms  deeper, they find out that they are &quot;soulmates&quot;, sharing the  perfect innocent love.  However, Albertine, who can easily pass off as a  White person is separated from Avik and sent away by Sister Banville  (played with stern harshness by Jeanne Moreau).  Avik, in his anguish,  breaks into the X-ray room and steals an X-ray of Albertine's heart.  That  photograph represents the love that Albertine will show for the rest of the  movie.7 years later Avik is back in the Arctic and things are not going  well. The hunt is going poorly and many are blaming him because he had  influence from White people.  Again, another plane lands and Russell has  returned. Avik helps him find a German submarine and Walter offers him a  position a position in the Royal Canadian Army.  Avik hearts leads him to  go, but he is the only one who can support his Grandmother.  So he refuses.  He asks Walter to find Albertine and gives him the x-ray of her  heart.Later, as conditions worsen for the tribe, they decide to travel  north.  While they take the grandmother, they refuse to take Avik.  In a  fit of anguish, the grandmother leaps from the ship and commits suicide.  Separated from the tribe forever, Avik heads south and joins the Royal Air  Command.In 1945, Avik is on his last mission as a recon  photographer/bomber for the Royal Canadian Army.  There he finds Albertine  and reunites with her.  She has a surprise for him.  She has fallen in love  with Walter.  Crushed, he spurns her and rejects Walter.  However, in a  peace gesture, Walter gives him the X-ray and she reconciles with her.  She  has lived as a Caucasian and seeing Avik brings out the painful reminder  that she is a &quot;half-breed&quot;.  However, as she learns to accept who  she really is, she fall in love with Avik.This love breaks the triangle  relationship that has formed between the three.  Russell, who has much  power in the Air Command, extends Aviks' plane's tour of duty as it becomes  aware that he knows about their affair. And it is this extra mission, that  the &quot;Holy Boy&quot; plane (a phrase Avik used as a child) get hit and  only Avik survives.  As he parachutes into Germany, his X-ray picture of  Albertine's heart is destroyed.  With his guilt (he feels responsible for  the death of his shipmates) and his love for Albertine, he heads back to  the Arctic to disappear from the world.  Hence we come to the  &quot;present&quot; 1965, where the whole movie was told as a flashback  story from a now 40 something Avik to a young Cartographer (John Cusack).The conclusion of this movie is something that is very special and needs  to be witnessed directly on film, so I will omit it from the review.  This  movie is beautiful to look at.  Vincent Ward, who later directed the  visually spectacular &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; with Robin Williams,  does a fantastic job capturing the mood and spirit of the far north and  creates the most Stunning WWII coverage I have seen on celluloid (it is  even better than Saving Private Ryan's footage).Avik, played by Jason  Scott Lee is played well, but it is the emotionally wounded Albertine  (played fabulously by Anne Parillaud) is the character to watch.  While she  is too old to play the part, she brings an emotional vulnerability to this  role that suits the character perfectly.  All the supporting characters  (John Cusack, Patrick Bergen and Jeanne Moreau) and well as the young  children have outstanding performances.If you want a movie with a daring  vision, artistic flair and is overly romantic, please rent this movie.  It  has my highest recommendations....Rating: A",5,"A beautiful, haunting movie.",968716800,"09 12, 2000",2000,4895,"['Being', 'ex-pat', 'Canadian', 'was', 'sort', 'suspicious', 'movie', 'wondered', 'would', 'capture', 'heart', 'soul', 'Northern', 'Arctic', 'Canada.After', 'all', 'director', 'New', 'Zealand', 'leads', 'are', 'two', 'American', 'One', 'Irish', 'Two', 'French', 'people', 'Canadian', 'However', 'fears', 'were', 'put', 'rest', 'opening', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', '.The', 'main', 'character', 'boy', 'named', 'Avik', 'who', 'half', 'Inuit/Caucasian', 'boy', 'mother', 'father', 'being', 'raised', 'grandmother', 'who', 'dearly', 'life', 'changed', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'great', 'bird', 'lands', 'tribal', 'lands', 'Cartographer', 'named', 'Walter', 'Russell', 'bird', 'course', 'Plane', '1931', 'Inuit', 'ever', 'seen', 'are', 'naturally', 'suspicious', 'However', 'Avik', 'not', 'magnificent', 'sight', 'changes', 'life', 'forever', 'Russell', 'staying', 'Inuit', 'tribe', 'region', 'world', 'maps', 'However', 'out', 'Avik', 'Tuberculosis', 'white', 'man', 'disease', 'take', 'back', 'Montreal', 'treatment', 'Catholic', 'Hospital.There', 'Albertine', 'who', 'half', 'Indian/Caucasian', 'similarity', 'being', 'quot', 'half-breed', 'quot', 'together', 'friendship', 'blossoms', 'deeper', 'find', 'out', 'are', 'quot', 'soulmates', 'quot', 'sharing', 'perfect', 'innocent', 'love', 'However', 'Albertine', 'who', 'can', 'easily', 'pass', 'off', 'White', 'person', 'separated', 'Avik', 'sent', 'away', 'Sister', 'Banville', 'played', 'stern', 'harshness', 'Jeanne', 'Moreau', 'Avik', 'anguish', 'X-ray', 'room', 'steals', 'X-ray', 'Albertine', 'heart', 'photograph', 'love', 'Albertine', 'will', 'show', 'rest', 'movie.7', 'years', 'later', 'Avik', 'back', 'Arctic', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'well', 'hunt', 'going', 'poorly', 'many', 'are', 'blaming', 'had', 'influence', 'White', 'people', 'Again', 'plane', 'lands', 'Russell', 'returned', 'Avik', 'find', 'German', 'submarine', 'Walter', 'position', 'position', 'Royal', 'Canadian', 'Army', 'Avik', 'go', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'support', 'Grandmother', 'So', 'Walter', 'find', 'Albertine', 'x-ray', 'heart.Later', 'conditions', 'worsen', 'tribe', 'decide', 'travel', 'north', 'take', 'grandmother', 'refuse', 'take', 'Avik', 'fit', 'anguish', 'grandmother', 'leaps', 'ship', 'commits', 'suicide', 'Separated', 'tribe', 'forever', 'Avik', 'south', 'Royal', 'Air', 'Command.In', '1945', 'Avik', 'last', 'mission', 'recon', 'photographer/bomber', 'Royal', 'Canadian', 'Army', 'Albertine', 'surprise', 'fallen', 'love', 'Walter', 'Crushed', 'Walter', 'However', 'peace', 'gesture', 'Walter', 'X-ray', 'lived', 'Caucasian', 'seeing', 'Avik', 'out', 'painful', 'reminder', 'quot', 'half-breed', 'quot', 'However', 'accept', 'who', 'really', 'fall', 'love', 'Avik.This', 'love', 'triangle', 'relationship', 'formed', 'three', 'Russell', 'who', 'much', 'power', 'Air', 'Command', 'Aviks', 'plane', 'tour', 'duty', 'aware', 'affair', 'extra', 'mission', 'quot', 'Holy', 'Boy', 'quot', 'plane', 'phrase', 'Avik', 'used', 'child', 'get', 'hit', 'only', 'Avik', 'Germany', 'X-ray', 'picture', 'Albertine', 'heart', 'destroyed', 'guilt', 'responsible', 'death', 'shipmates', 'love', 'Albertine', 'back', 'Arctic', 'disappear', 'world', 'Hence', 'come', 'quot', 'present', 'quot', '1965', 'where', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'told', 'flashback', 'story', 'now', '40', 'something', 'Avik', 'young', 'Cartographer', 'John', 'Cusack', '.The', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'something', 'very', 'special', 'needs', 'be', 'witnessed', 'directly', 'film', 'will', 'omit', 'review', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'look', 'Vincent', 'Ward', 'who', 'later', 'directed', 'visually', 'spectacular', 'quot', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'quot', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'fantastic', 'job', 'capturing', 'mood', 'spirit', 'far', 'north', 'most', 'Stunning', 'WWII', 'coverage', 'have', 'seen', 'celluloid', 'even', 'better', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'footage', '.Avik', 'played', 'Jason', 'Scott', 'Lee', 'played', 'well', 'emotionally', 'wounded', 'Albertine', 'played', 'fabulously', 'Anne', 'Parillaud', 'character', 'watch', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'part', 'emotional', 'vulnerability', 'role', 'suits', 'character', 'perfectly', 'supporting', 'characters', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Patrick', 'Bergen', 'Jeanne', 'Moreau', 'well', 'young', 'children', 'have', 'outstanding', 'performances.If', 'want', 'movie', 'daring', 'vision', 'artistic', 'flair', 'overly', 'romantic', 'please', 'rent', 'movie', 'highest', 'recommendations', '.Rating', 'A']",N/A

This is an excellent romance story that's quite different, quite touching and quite haunting.

The filmmakers did an amazing job finding two kids who really look like the two adults probably would have looked like when they were young and with the same voice inflections and accents.As adults Jason Scott Lee and Anne Parillaud are memorable. So is the cinematography, particularly the Dresden bombing scene which is simply jaw- dropping.*****Spoiler alert****  The movie is heart-wrenching at times with not so-happy ending, but I think that helps make this film so memorable, so haunting.

341023,A3LA8WLE0RQ4MB,6302859344,"D. Movahedpour ""doeadear""","[7, 7]","I found this to be one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen. It tells the story of Avik, a young Eskimo boy who meets Walter Russell (Patrick Bergin) when Walter comes to map his village. Avik discovers he has Tuberculosis, and Walter takes the young boy to Montreal where he stays at a Catholic hospital. There he meets Albertine, a young girl of mixed French Canadian and Indian blood. They grow attached to each other, in spite of the meddling of one of the nuns, played by Jeanne Moreau. Eventually, Avik and Albertine are separated. Avik returns to his village, and becomes a man. He finds he is ostracized by his fellow tribe, because he has lived too long among the white people.Avik as an adult is played by Jason Scott Lee. By this time, Canada is involved in World War II, and Avik joins the Air Force and flies on bombing raids. He is reunited with Albertine (Anne Parillaud) in London, who is also in the military. Unfortunately, so is Walter Russell. And it seems that he and Albertine have met and become romantically involved.

It is both emotionally poignant and visually beautiful.The film stars Jason Scott Lee.  I have always admired him...  This is the only movie that I can recall seeing him in where he does not do any martial arts / fighting scenes at all.  Instead, all is focused on his remarkable acting abilities...Patrick Bergin also stars as a rather ambiguous character.  During most of the movie, one is not quite sure what to think of him.  His performance is top knotch.The film is set over about a 50 year time span (or so):  WWI in northern Canada, WWII London and late 1960s northern Canada.  The film depicts the story of a Canadian eskimo boy(later played by Lee) who is befriended by a RAF gentleman (Bergin).  The boy grows up and becomes a bombadier in the RAF in WWII.  Along the way, he falls in love with a mysterious Indian girl.The movie centers around the (to this day) controversial decision to bomb Dresden, Germany.  By the time the option was selected to bomb this venerable city, the war was all but officially over.  What made it so controversial was that 900 year old Dresden was not in any way, shape or form a military target.  It contained (and still does) Germany's most valued treasures;  her best opera houses, museums, art galleries and historical architecture.  The lone reason for the bombing lay in the fact that the allies wanted to &quot;teach Germany a lesson&quot; for her audacity.  The bombing caused a firestorm in the city which killed more people than the A-bombs of Nagasaki and Hiroshima combined.It is recommended that anyone who watches this movie also read Thomas Mann's &quot;Dr. Faustus&quot; alongside it.  Dresden serves as a likely avatar for the Dresden &quot;soul&quot; which Mann's Faustus (the Nazis) sold to the German Mephistopheles (Hitler).  Freeman Dyson's &quot;Disturbing The Universe&quot; and Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;Slaughterhouse 5&quot;  would also be good reads in conjunction with this movie.This is one of the most lavish and emotionally powerful movies I have ever seen.  I would say that it is every bit as pungent as &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; only in a different way.  The acting, direction and soundtrack are all exquisite.

Bernabo,"[5, 5]","There is an inherent sense of wonder to the story of an Inuit that can begin in the frozen arctic of Canada and takes him to the firebombing of Dresden during World War II.  In 1931 young Avik (Robert Joamie) sees an airplane land on the ice, and meets Walter Russell (Patrick Bergin), a mapmaker.  The boy exhibits some curiosity in Russell's surveyor gear and says ""Holy Boy"" instead of ""Holy Cow,"" which apparently endears him enough to Russell that when he discovers Avik is suffering from tuberculosis he takes the boy to Montreal.  The cure is painful enough, but Avik also has to deal with the attentions of Sister Banville (Jeanne Moreau), who wants to turn him and the other native children into good little white children.  But Avik forms a friendship with young Albertine (Annie Galipeau) that forges a link for life.What Avik and Albertine most share in common is that they are trapped between two worlds: he is half white and half Eskimo while she is half white and half Indian.  When they are separated again it is her desire to one day sing a song on the wireless that becomes the key to their connecting once again as adults.  As an adult, Avik (Jason Scott Lee) is considered a curse to his tribe and they want nothing to do with him, so when Russell returns and explains that the world is at war, Avik decides to enlist.  He becomes a photographer in a bomber, named ""Holy Boy!"" of course, recording the affects of bomb strikes, and one day Albertine (Anne Parillaud) finds him.  She is also in the military and her job is to analyze strike photographs, which affords some rather interesting ways for him to communicate with her as the war continues.There is a framing device for this story, as Avik tells his story in flashback to a new mapmaker (John Cusack), who has come into the frozen north.  The relationship between Avik and Albertine certainly has its moments, especially when it gets above the group, a motif that is repeated throughout the film often enough for us to catch on to its significance.  The figure of Russell continues to figure largely in Avik's life, but when it involves Albertine as well I was uncomfortable with the turn of events.  But the narrative builds to such a point that a great leap forward in time and space is mandated to be able to tell the ending of the tale.  There are exquisite and memorable scenes to be sure in the final act as director Vincent Ward tries to have his film take wing.  In this regard it will succeed with some and with others not so well, but regardless of which camp you find yourself in at the end, it is certainly worth the watching.",4,"The odyssey through life of an Inuit named Avik (a.k.a.

What makes this film so wonderful are the spectacular location shots, the superb acting, and the ambition of the storyline.The most notable sequences are the bombing of Dresden, the &quot;dance&quot; atop the ceiling/roof of the famous Albert Hall theatre, the balloon sequence at the end of the film, and the most indelible site, the love scene atop a barrage balloon.  Jason Scott Lee and Ann Parillaud are wonderful in the title roles and Patrick Bergan turns in a really good performance in what may be the most complex character he's ever played (though he does get a &quot;movie star&quot; moment in the film when he dramatically turns around to greet Avik in a London Ballroom).Special note must be made of the young Avik (Robert Joamie) and Albertine (Annie Galipeau, who possesses an interesting voice to say the least) in the Catholic hospital/school.  There is real chemestry present between the actors and it shows.  Particularly the scene in which both of them are trying to escape, Albertine gives Avik a knife and says, &quot;Take a part of me.&quot;, Avik proceeds to cut off some of her hair, the scene was so moving it left me in tears.The DVD presentation is really dissapointing considering how long we've had to wait for it.  While the movie itself is presented in clean widescreen (using the European cut from what I understand, it's about five minutes longer than the American version), the only extras are four deleted scenes.  Three of which take place when Avik &amp; Albertine are at the Catholic hospital/school.  Apparently, the &quot;Bunny Ears&quot; deleted scene must be rather infamous considering a promo shot from it is used on the DVD cover.  The scene itself looks like it never made it to a preview audience (the film is unprocessed) and it ends with a urination bit that left my jaw on the floor.  The deleted scene with Avik tearing a hole through a wall is rather nice, ending with him and Albertine playfully kissing each other.It's rather puzzling that there were no other extras like a photo gallery (promo photos were used on the menu pages), cast &amp; crew bios, and production notes were put in, in lieu of a director's commentary (which I can understand may have been difficult to get).&quot;Map of the Human Heart&quot; is one of the finest films ever made that vitually no one has seen.

341032,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,6302859344,Muzzlehatch,"[0, 0]","Certainly director Vincent Ward wasn't exactly a household name at the time that this film first came out - and I first saw it - though in retrospect this film and his next - the even more expensive and more visually ambitious WHAT DREAMS MAY COME five years later - seem like his bids to hit the mainstream, or at least to make a name for himself as a high-profile art-film auteur like Terence Malick or Wim Wenders at the time. Given how few people probably recognize his name, or have seen his subsequent barely-distributed films, it's pretty clear that he failed. I'm not entirely sure, on the basis of this film, why that's the case, though the Robin Williams romance that followed really did not work for me or for the mass audiences it's large budget needed, and it clearly was the nail in the coffin as far as a large-scale career was concerned.Like that film, and Ward's first two features, VIGIL and THE NAVIGATOR, MAP OF THE HUMAN HEART concerns strange people in strange surroundings, and has an indefinable mystical aura about it, though I think the spiritual element is more muted here than in any of his other early films. A young half white-half Inuit boy, Avik (Robert Joamie) is befriended by a white surveyor and cartographer, Walter Russell (Patrick Bergin) in the arctic in 1931. Avik it turns out has TB, and is taken to a hospital in Montreal to be treated. There he befriends Albertine (Annie Galipeau), also of mixed race and a few years older, and the two strike up a powerful friendship, going so far as to risk serious punishment to be with each other. Eventually they are separated and Avik goes back to his village, but a decade later Russell returns, and Avik (played by Jason Scott Lee as an adult) finds out that Albertine is singing in a conservatory in Ottawa. He leaves to find her, and eventually winds up in England as a bombardier during the war. Albertine (now Anne Parillaud) is there too, working in bomber command, but their would-be romance is complicated by her having formed a relationship with Russell - who is a leader in the command. Eventually Avik participates in the bombing of Dresden, and there his world changes forever...MAP OF THE HUMAN HEART is one of those wild, extravagant continents- and decades-spanning romances, then, with lovers torn apart by fate, war, inconstancy, fear, lies....etc. You know the type. It was clearly expensive, filmed in lots of different kinds of locations with some impressive effects photography of the Dresden fires and bombing runs; and some of the photography (by Eduardo Serra) is pretty stunning. There's a great shot of Avik and Albertine dancing on the roof of the Albert Hall for example with the starlight behind them, and another of a barrage-balloon love scene that's got something of that ecstatic feeling that I'm looking for in such films. But it doesn't always succeed in sweeping us away in this vision, and I think part of the problem may be in Ward's direction and the too-rushed feeling that much of the last third of the film has. Had the framing structure (with John Cusack as a mapmaker in 1965 who runs across now middle-aged Avik and gets his story) been done away with, and as much attention been spent on the denouement and finale of Avik's story, the sense of weight and tragedy that I think Ward was trying to convey might have worked more fully. And ultimately, the three main characters are just a little too thin, a little too close to archetypes, their fates seeming a little too inevitable and out of a book.Still this is a film with some powerful scenes, good performances all around - the child actors are especially impressive and well matched to their adult counterparts, and Jason Scott Lee is just super-likeable and charismatic, you really WANT him to achieve his dreams. Gabriel Yared's synth score is quite nice also. I doubt Ward will ever make a masterpiece; on the basis of this film at least, I think he might have the talent if all the cards were to fall right. Certainly anyone new to this director would I think do best to start with this one.  And I'm sure some people will get that sense of transcendence and the everlasting power of love that didn't quite overwhelm me, as much as I wanted it to.DVD NOTE: A decent 2.35:1 transfer here, though as some reviewers have mentioned, Ward isn't necessarily using the wide screen to full advantage all the time; this might have been better shot at 1.85:1.  Minimal extras include a few brief deleted scenes, mostly from early parts of the film, which don't add much of substance.",4,A bid for transcendence that falls short - but only by a little,1284336000,"09 13, 2010",2010,4563,"['Certainly', 'director', 'Vincent', 'Ward', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'household', 'name', 'time', 'film', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'first', 'saw', 'retrospect', 'film', 'next', 'even', 'more', 'expensive', 'more', 'visually', 'ambitious', 'WHAT', 'DREAMS', 'MAY', 'COME', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'seem', 'bids', 'hit', 'mainstream', 'least', 'make', 'name', 'high-profile', 'art-film', 'auteur', 'Terence', 'Malick', 'Wim', 'Wenders', 'time', 'Given', 'how', 'few', 'people', 'probably', 'recognize', 'name', 'have', 'seen', 'subsequent', 'barely-distributed', 'films', 'pretty', 'clear', 'failed', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'basis', 'film', 'why', 'case', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'romance', 'followed', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'mass', 'large', 'budget', 'needed', 'clearly', 'was', 'nail', 'coffin', 'as', 'far', 'large-scale', 'career', 'was', 'concerned.Like', 'film', 'Ward', 'first', 'two', 'features', 'VIGIL', 'THE', 'NAVIGATOR', 'MAP', 'THE', 'HUMAN', 'HEART', 'strange', 'people', 'strange', 'surroundings', 'indefinable', 'mystical', 'aura', 'think', 'spiritual', 'element', 'more', 'muted', 'here', 'other', 'early', 'films', 'young', 'half', 'white-half', 'Inuit', 'boy', 'Avik', 'Robert', 'Joamie', 'befriended', 'white', 'surveyor', 'cartographer', 'Walter', 'Russell', 'Patrick', 'Bergin', 'arctic', '1931', 'Avik', 'out', 'TB', 'taken', 'hospital', 'Montreal', 'be', 'treated', 'Albertine', 'Annie', 'Galipeau', 'also', 'mixed', 'race', 'few', 'years', 'older', 'two', 'strike', 'powerful', 'friendship', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'risk', 'serious', 'punishment', 'be', 'other', 'Eventually', 'are', 'separated', 'Avik', 'back', 'village', 'decade', 'later', 'Russell', 'returns', 'Avik', 'played', 'Jason', 'Scott', 'Lee', 'adult', 'out', 'Albertine', 'singing', 'conservatory', 'Ottawa', 'find', 'eventually', 'up', 'England', 'bombardier', 'war', 'Albertine', 'now', 'Anne', 'Parillaud', 'there', 'too', 'working', 'bomber', 'command', 'would-be', 'romance', 'complicated', 'having', 'formed', 'relationship', 'Russell', 'who', 'leader', 'command', 'Eventually', 'Avik', 'participates', 'bombing', 'Dresden', 'there', 'world', 'changes', 'forever', 'MAP', 'THE', 'HUMAN', 'HEART', 'one', 'wild', 'extravagant', 'continents-', 'decades-spanning', 'romances', 'then', 'lovers', 'torn', 'apart', 'fate', 'war', 'inconstancy', 'fear', '.etc', 'know', 'type', 'was', 'clearly', 'expensive', 'filmed', 'lots', 'different', 'kinds', 'locations', 'impressive', 'effects', 'photography', 'Dresden', 'fires', 'bombing', 'runs', 'photography', 'Eduardo', 'Serra', 'pretty', 'stunning', 'great', 'shot', 'Avik', 'Albertine', 'dancing', 'roof', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'example', 'starlight', 'barrage-balloon', 'love', 'scene', 'got', 'something', 'ecstatic', 'feeling', ""'m"", 'looking', 'such', 'films', ""n't"", 'always', 'succeed', 'sweeping', 'away', 'vision', 'think', 'part', 'problem', 'may', 'be', 'Ward', 'direction', 'too-rushed', 'feeling', 'much', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'Had', 'framing', 'structure', 'John', 'Cusack', 'mapmaker', '1965', 'who', 'now', 'middle-aged', 'Avik', 'story', 'been', 'done', 'away', 'as', 'much', 'attention', 'been', 'spent', 'denouement', 'finale', 'Avik', 'story', 'sense', 'weight', 'tragedy', 'think', 'Ward', 'was', 'trying', 'convey', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'more', 'fully', 'ultimately', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'thin', 'little', 'too', 'close', 'archetypes', 'fates', 'seeming', 'little', 'too', 'inevitable', 'book.Still', 'film', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'good', 'performances', 'child', 'actors', 'are', 'especially', 'impressive', 'well', 'matched', 'adult', 'counterparts', 'Jason', 'Scott', 'Lee', 'just', 'super-likeable', 'charismatic', 'really', 'WANT', 'achieve', 'dreams', 'Gabriel', 'Yared', 'synth', 'score', 'quite', 'nice', 'also', 'doubt', 'Ward', 'will', 'ever', 'make', 'masterpiece', 'basis', 'film', 'least', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'talent', 'cards', 'were', 'fall', 'right', 'Certainly', 'anyone', 'new', 'director', 'would', 'think', 'do', 'best', 'start', 'one', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'will', 'get', 'sense', 'transcendence', 'everlasting', 'power', 'love', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'overwhelm', 'as', 'much', 'wanted', 'to.DVD', 'NOTE', 'decent', '2.35:1', 'transfer', 'here', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Ward', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'using', 'wide', 'screen', 'full', 'advantage', 'time', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'shot', '1.85:1', 'Minimal', 'extras', 'include', 'few', 'brief', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'mostly', 'early', 'parts', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'substance']",N/A

Whereas his earlier films (Vigil [VHS] &The Navigator: A Time Travel Adventure [VHS]) were able to combine stunning, painterly-like imagery with intriguing narratives, this film tries to do too much and, in aiming high, ends-up feeling clumsy and passionless. It doesn't help that none of the acting is particularly superlative nor that the editing is so poor that this 110-minute production feels like a 3-4 hour experience. I like the idea of incorporating the clash of modern culture with non-dominant peoples as well as the brief exploration of the incineration of Dresden, but the attempt to combine these elements with the melodramatic concept of fate playing an integral part in the intertwined lives of the two leads seems sophomoric.

What an epic, from a tender adolescent love story, to tuberculosis in the Arctic, and then (holy boy!) it's on to the airforce and a war, a singing career, a love scene on top of a barrage balloon, and they're up in the rafters at Albert Hall during the blitz, and along the way we briefly descend into the firestorm of Dresden and see one of the best fire scenes captured on film where a man is transformed to cinders crossing the street; and it is all a story narrated by an unreliable Eskimo who wants another drink.  Some folks miss the point, they compain about clunky scene transitions and plot contrivances.  But they are the non-believers.  If you want big cinema, an ambitious globe-spanning epic, then Ward's movie achieves greatness.

341036,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6302859344,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","Vincent Ward's Map of the Human Heart is one of those interesting failures that never quite live up to their potential. Its tale of an Eskimo and a half-Indian Canadian girl who first meet in the children's hospital he has been taken to by Patrick Bergin's ambiguous mapmaker and whose paths cross again in WW2 until the firebombing of Dresden brings matters to ahead may offer a wide canvas, but the director seems to lose his way and a considerable amount of audience involvement en route.Re-edited after a lukewarm Cannes screening and boasting three script editors and more producers than extras, it never reaches the heart or emotions, with an ending that seems too contrived than inevitable while as an academic exercise the script's ambitions never seem fully realised. Jason Scott Lee gives a good lead performance and individual scenes stick in the memory - the lovers bouncing on top of a barrage balloon, the vividly realised firebombing and Bergin's chillingly piquish rationale for targeting it - but it's hard not to feel that something got lost in the edit.Shot in 65mm for 70mm exhibition but only shown in 35mm, the original 65mm negative for Ward's first cut is rumored to still exist, but the Region 1 NTSC DVD is from the European theatrical release version, though it does at least include 4 deleted scenes.
