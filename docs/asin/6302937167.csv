346607,A1IWR4FKPGE95C,6302937167,Carlos Rodriguez,"[16, 16]","I just saw this movie last night and didn't think it as bad as most people say that it is. It's not great and much less one that would be hailed as a masterpiece of comtemporary American cinema but I thought overall it was pretty good. The movie does move at a slow pace for the most part but it did keep me interested in its characters and how they were going to turn out. Marlon Brando plays the leader of a ruthless gang of kidnappers who proceed to kidnap a young lady as soon as she arrives in Paris. She is then taken hostage and driven to an isolated beachhouse owned by the stewardess that she met on the plane. As the days wore on the tension and danger builds and their plan turns horribly wrong and everyone feels the pressure as danger begins to consume them. Marlon Brando is always good as he seldom if ever disappoints and he plays his role with a smooth raw edge that is cool and collected and always serious. Richard Boone is perhaps the most cynical and dangerous villain of the group and he delivers a performance that is both intriguing and great. Rita Moreno is fantastic as the blonde cocaine addicted flight attendant who is Brando's partner in crime and lover. It was reported that the both of them were having a passionate and torrid affair during the filming of the movie. The last 14 minutes of the film leave you somewhat confused (atlest it did me) and the ending leaves you hanging and expecting something else to happen or atleast give the viewer an indication that something else has to happen but it doesn't. Not a bad movie, I thought it was going to be a bomb but it wasn't you should consider watching this movie and looking at it for what it is one of Marlon Brando's most obscure and less known films but all that considered a fairly decent movie.",4,Not as bad as people say it is,1167609600,"01 1, 2007",2007,1785,"['just', 'saw', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'as', 'bad', 'most', 'people', 'say', 'not', 'great', 'much', 'less', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'hailed', 'masterpiece', 'comtemporary', 'American', 'cinema', 'thought', 'overall', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'move', 'slow', 'pace', 'most', 'part', 'did', 'keep', 'interested', 'characters', 'how', 'were', 'going', 'turn', 'out', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'leader', 'ruthless', 'gang', 'kidnappers', 'who', 'proceed', 'kidnap', 'young', 'lady', 'as', 'soon', 'Paris', 'then', 'taken', 'hostage', 'driven', 'isolated', 'beachhouse', 'owned', 'stewardess', 'met', 'plane', 'days', 'wore', 'tension', 'danger', 'builds', 'plan', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'everyone', 'pressure', 'danger', 'consume', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'always', 'good', 'ever', 'disappoints', 'role', 'smooth', 'raw', 'edge', 'cool', 'collected', 'always', 'serious', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'perhaps', 'most', 'cynical', 'dangerous', 'villain', 'group', 'performance', 'intriguing', 'great', 'Rita', 'Moreno', 'fantastic', 'blonde', 'cocaine', 'addicted', 'flight', 'attendant', 'who', 'Brando', 'partner', 'crime', 'lover', 'was', 'reported', 'were', 'having', 'passionate', 'torrid', 'affair', 'filming', 'movie', 'last', '14', 'minutes', 'film', 'leave', 'somewhat', 'confused', 'did', 'ending', 'leaves', 'hanging', 'expecting', 'something', 'else', 'happen', 'atleast', 'give', 'viewer', 'indication', 'something', 'else', 'happen', ""n't"", 'Not', 'bad', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'bomb', 'was', ""n't"", 'should', 'consider', 'watching', 'movie', 'looking', 'what', 'one', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'most', 'obscure', 'less', 'known', 'films', 'considered', 'fairly', 'decent', 'movie']",N/A

346609,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,6302937167,Chip Kaufmann,"[1, 1]","THE NIGHT OF THE FOLLOWING DAY is one of those films that has been criminally underseen and that needs to be seen (instead of talked about) in order to be appreciated. If anyone other than Marlon Brando had been in it (which was the original plan) it would have fared much better critically and commercially. This is not to say that Brando is bad, in fact his performance looks even better now than it did when the film was first released. It's just that he always carries so much critical baggage with him (being pilloried for making films critics considered beneath him) that only in recent years can a film like NIGHT be re-evaluated and enjoyed. The director, Hubert Cornfield, had a difficult time with Brando and was fired with two weeks to go. Co-star Richard Boone finished the picture. Be warned that the DVD commentary attributed to Cornfield on some DVDs is actually Brando himself (which is why it sounds like an electronic voice box) and has now been withdrawn from all future editions. Just Marlon having his little joke at his own expense and giving another great performance in the process.The story is a simple and familiar one. A young heiress (Pamela Franklin) is kidnapped by 4 people and stashed away in a small beach house on the French coast. The kidnappers are an odd lot headed up by the ineffectual Wally (Jess Hahn). The others consist of uncertain chauffeur Bud (Brando), his drugged out girl friend Vi (Rita Moreno), and their sadistic henchman Leer (Richard Boone). These people are all losers and you just know that things will go from bad to worse. How they do and what ultimately happens are what keep you watching. What adds an extra dimension are Stanley Myers' background jazz score and the overall look especially the surreal Magritte like final confrontation between Brando and Boone (who is complete with bowler hat and umbrella). The DEAD OF NIGHT ending is what it is because Brando refused to cooperate but it manages to be creepy anyway although some people will hate it. As a minor exercise in style with an underrated Brando performance and a terrifying one from Boone, NIGHT OF THE FOLLOWING DAY deserves another look.",4,"Neglected, Offbeat Film Noir With Memorable Performances Deserves A Wider Audience.",1386806400,"12 12, 2013",2013,2164,"['NIGHT', 'THE', 'FOLLOWING', 'DAY', 'one', 'films', 'been', 'criminally', 'underseen', 'be', 'seen', 'instead', 'talked', 'order', 'be', 'appreciated', 'anyone', 'other', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'had', 'been', 'was', 'original', 'plan', 'would', 'have', 'fared', 'much', 'better', 'critically', 'commercially', 'not', 'say', 'Brando', 'bad', 'fact', 'performance', 'even', 'better', 'now', 'did', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'just', 'always', 'so', 'much', 'critical', 'baggage', 'being', 'pilloried', 'making', 'films', 'critics', 'considered', 'only', 'recent', 'years', 'can', 'film', 'NIGHT', 'be', 're-evaluated', 'enjoyed', 'director', 'Hubert', 'Cornfield', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', 'Brando', 'was', 'fired', 'two', 'weeks', 'go', 'Co-star', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'finished', 'picture', 'Be', 'warned', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'attributed', 'Cornfield', 'DVDs', 'actually', 'Brando', 'why', 'electronic', 'voice', 'box', 'now', 'been', 'withdrawn', 'future', 'editions', 'Just', 'Marlon', 'having', 'little', 'joke', 'own', 'expense', 'giving', 'great', 'performance', 'process.The', 'story', 'simple', 'familiar', 'one', 'young', 'heiress', 'Pamela', 'Franklin', 'kidnapped', '4', 'people', 'stashed', 'away', 'small', 'beach', 'house', 'French', 'coast', 'kidnappers', 'are', 'odd', 'lot', 'headed', 'up', 'ineffectual', 'Wally', 'Jess', 'Hahn', 'others', 'consist', 'uncertain', 'chauffeur', 'Bud', 'Brando', 'drugged', 'out', 'girl', 'friend', 'Vi', 'Rita', 'Moreno', 'sadistic', 'henchman', 'Leer', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'people', 'are', 'losers', 'just', 'know', 'things', 'will', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'How', 'do', 'what', 'ultimately', 'are', 'what', 'keep', 'watching', 'What', 'extra', 'dimension', 'are', 'Stanley', 'Myers', 'background', 'jazz', 'score', 'overall', 'look', 'especially', 'surreal', 'Magritte', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Brando', 'Boone', 'who', 'complete', 'bowler', 'hat', 'umbrella', 'DEAD', 'OF', 'NIGHT', 'ending', 'what', 'Brando', 'refused', 'cooperate', 'be', 'creepy', 'anyway', 'people', 'will', 'hate', 'minor', 'exercise', 'style', 'underrated', 'Brando', 'performance', 'terrifying', 'one', 'Boone', 'NIGHT', 'THE', 'FOLLOWING', 'DAY', 'look']",N/A
346610,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6302937167,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 2]","(note: This review is for the DVD included in the Marlon Brando 4-Movie DVD Box Set)Filmmaker Hubert Cornfield is best known for his '60s and '70s films which include ""The 3rd Voice"" (1960) starring Edmond O'Brien and Julie London, ""Pressure Point"" (1962) starring Sidney Poitier and Bobby Darin and his 1968 film ""The Night of the Following Day"" starring Marlon Brando, Rita Moreno, Richard Boone and Pamela Franklin.As Universal Studios Home Entertainment have released DVD box sets to celebrate an actor or actress in their films, in 2005, Marlon Brando received his Universal Studios Home Entertainment node with a 4-movie DVD box set collection which includes ""The Night of the Following Day"", ""A Countess from Hong Kong"" (1967), ""The Ugly American"" (1963) and ""The Appaloosa"" (1966).Actor Marlon Brando has played many diverse characters throughout his career and in ""The Night of the Following Day"", it's probably one of the few films that Brando did have problems with.Originally planned for actor Richard Boone for the lead, former MCA agent Elliot Kastner pushed for Brando and became an executive producer for the film and the film was shot in France.  As for Richard Boone, he would play the devious criminal named Leer.The story is loosely based on Lionel White's ""The Snatch"" but director Hubert Cornfield admitted that the true inspiration for the film was the 1945 British film ""Dead of Night"".Unfortunately, when they started shooting, Marlon Brando and director Hubert Cornfield were like oil and water and Cornfield was quite vocal that Brando did everything he could to humiliate him and sabotage the movie.Brando was drunk many times throughout the film and according to Cornfield, it was a film that took quite a bit of editing to make it work.  Brando refused to go by Cornfield's rules and eventually there was a boiling point in which Brando refused to work with the director.  And with a key scene needed to be filmed, the only way to do it was for actor Richard Boone to direct that one scene.Needless to say, ""The Night of the Following Day"" is probably one film that Marlon Brando could care less of and it was probably one of the few films in which you will hear a director (in his commentary) talk about how difficult he was to work with.  It was well known that Marlon Brando is a method actor, an intense actor and actor of his caliber required a director who can work with him and understand his style. Unfortunately, the film was problematic behind-the-scenes but yet, director Hubert Cornfield was able to create a film with the footage that he had.""The Night of the Following Day"" is about a young heiress of the Dupont family (played by Pamela Franklin).  As she is flying to Paris, she meets with Vi, the air stewardess (played by Rita Moreno) and at the airport, she is greeted by her chauffeur (played by Marlon Brando).But immediately, while the chauffeur drives to a different location, it is revealed that she is being kidnapped and when she meets the brooding Leer (played by Richard Boone),  she is told that she has been kidnapped by a group of criminals who will not hurt her if she plays by the rules and if her father pays the ransom.We quickly learn that the person heading the kidnapping is Vi's brother Wally and all are expecting the wealthy Dupont (played by Jacques Marin) to pay for the ransom but the chauffeur and Vi notices an evil side to Leer as he does things to hurt the victim, first by stepping on her feet and then at one point where the heiress tries to escape, she pushes her off the staircase.The chauffeur realizes that this Leer may be a loose cannon and the way he is behaving, this girl might be dead and that is not what he signed up for and wants to quit.  Wally tries to calm him down and remind him that they are close to getting the money and pleads with the chauffeur to stay.  Meanwhile, Vi...a former alcoholic and drug user, is starting to bow down under all the stress (especially after meeting a policeman in the area who keeps asking her questions) and starts to think that her boyfriend, the chauffeur, may have eyes for the victim and starts unleashing her anger towards him.This is another reason why the chauffeur wants to quit the operation because of Vi, but once again Wally tries to calm him down and remind him that they are close to getting the money and to pretend that he cares for Vi until they get the money and that he can break up with her once they are done.While the three focus on their operation, Leer seems to have other plans in mind and may be working with another group of thieves and planning to use Wally, the chauffeur and Vi as scapegoats and taking all the ransom money.With the upcoming ransom exchange to take place, the chauffeur gets a feeling that something is going to go wrong and that Leer is going to betray them or possibly even hurt the kidnapping victim.  What will the chauffeur do?VIDEO & AUDIO:""The Night of the Following Day"" is presented in anamorphic widescreen (1:85:1) and the good news is that there seems to be some remaster work as the film does look very good considering it is over 40-years old.  There is a good amount of grain in the film and although you can see dust and speckles from time-to-time, it's not all that distracting.As for audio, the audio is presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo, so it is a front-channel driven soundtrack.  Dialogue is clear as well as the film's jazzy music soundtrack.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Night of the Following Day"" comes with the following special features:- Feature Commentary with Director Hubert Cornfield - Cornfield discusses the challenges he had on the set with Brando but also various scenes. It's important to note that it sounds as if Cornfield may have had a tracheotomy, so the commentary may be difficult for some to follow.- Trailer - (3:11) The original theatrical trailer for ""The Night of the Following Day"".JUDGMENT CALL:If Hubert Cornfield was inspired by the UK film ""Night of the Dead"", somehow ""The Night of the Following Day"" is a film that has uneven structure, kitschy acting and an ending that by no means is revolutionary, artistic or satisfying.  The fact is that Cornfield didn't get the ending that he wanted because he and Brando didn't get along.Brando was drunk, he could care less about the film and if anything, even if Brando gave his 100%, I'm not even sure if it would have saved this film.The idea of kidnapping an heiress and trying to wait out for the ransom money and seeing how the kidnappers begin to unbuckle is one thing but somehow the characters don't seem too believable.  Aside from Marlon Brando and Richard Boone, there are so many plot holes.For one, how is it that Rita Moreno's Vi could be on the same flight as a flight stewardess for the Ms. Dupont?  How would they know her itinerary for her arrival in France, someone in the Dupont family feeding these criminals information?  Especially finding out that the mastermind is Wally, Vi's brother, who is down and out of jobs and life is not going well for him.  It just doesn't seem right and the characters are just out of place.Pamela Franklin doesn't hardly even speak.  She is a critical character and she could have given a wonderful performance if given the dialogue to show her fear towards the kidnappers, especially Leer but most of the time you get grunts and groans and only until she and the chauffeur talk near the end of the film, you wonder why Cornfield waited that long to make her talk. Non-essential?  Wrong.  She is obviously an essential character but the focus was on the kidnappers. The victim could have added some dimension to this film.And Marlon Brando, as drunk as he may have been during the filming of those scenes, he did a rather wonderful job.  But I feel that there were too many problems with his character.  If anything, he was the guy wanting to give in.  The guy throwing the white flag of ""I give up"" and ""I want to stop"".  For a guy who was helping lead the operation, all of a sudden he wants to quit?  Personally, if Brando was upset about his character utilization for this film and that is why he didn't get a long with writer/director Hubert Cornfield, I can understand.  This was the worst way to utilize Brando for this role, making him seem to passive and then all of a sudden making him a much different character by the end of the film.Rita Moreno playing the stressed out girlfriend, Vi, was a hard sell as a drug user or alcoholic. We are so used to seeing her on Disney programming or ""West Side Story"" but to see her as Brando's leading lady, it just didn't work for me.  Both she and Brando did not have chemistry and if Wally was supposed to be her brother, they should have cast someone that at least has some sort of resemblance to her.If there was anything positive about the film was the fact that they did cast Richard Boone as the devious Leer.  His depiction of the vile, sadistic Leer was excellent and for the most part, Cornfield gave the best role to the actor which he wanted to be the main character.  But Richard Boone is probably the actor who helped carry this film, by making the audience despise him for his wickedness and eventually having us hope that their is a wonderful payoff when we see Brando's chauffeur and Leer taking each other on.And last but not least, it's the ending that will tick people off.  As mentioned, the inspiration of Cornfield for its ending was the 1945 film ""Dead of Night"" in which in the case of ""The Night of the Following Day"", Ms. Dupont while sleeping on the plane wakes up from her ""premonition"" dream and thus repeating what happened in that dream.  While Westerners may despise the ending and those who are used to French films having endings that may not make any sense but are considered creative, I personally did not feel satisfied with this ending at all.  In fact, even Hubert Cornfield wasn't content as well as he couldn't get Brando to do what he wanted and had to resort to a freeze frame for the ending.So, what you have with ""The Night of the Following Day"" is a film in which Hubert Cornfield really had to take what he had, edit it and make it to a film.  It may not be what he wanted, it may not be what Brando wanted but they were able to make a film together.Unfortunately, the failure of the film didn't help Cornfield in the West but he was able to direct French TV series and a French film a decade later.  Brando on the other hand would bounce back years later in 1972 with two critically acclaimed films ""The Godfather"" and  ""Last Tango in Paris"".But I can understand the inclusion of ""The Night of the Following Day"" in the Marlon Brando: 4-Movie Collection.  The set is about showcasing his diverse talent and in the case of this film, it's probably the main film featuring Brando at one of his worst (behind-the-scenes) but it is a film to catch him playing a con artist.Brando has too many films which are highlights from his long and respectable oeuvre but it's one thing to have a film with a lackadaisical plot but there is also a hint of malaise when knowing that Brando himself, didn't care much about the film and was not giving it his best since he and the director didn't meet eye-to-eye.  But it is part of this DVD set and fortunately, if this film doesn't entertain you, hopefully the other three films in the set will.",3,"Definitely not one of Marlon Brando's best or even good films

Unfortunately, they're presented and dropped before they can be developed.Richard Boone, one of Hollywood's greatest character actors, plays an amoral sadist here, and his scenes with Brando positively crackle with tension and electricity.  Rita Moreno, in a blond wig, is astonishing as the junkie airline stewardess, who makes this caper possible, but endangers it at every turn with her character's thoughtlessness and weaknesses.There's some very good acting to watch here, and Brando, still in his physical prime, is riveting.  Sadly, the pacing of the movie is very slow, and the point of it all seems to be missing.  All of the characters are flawed enough to be interesting, but the plot never coalesces to the point where we should care about any of them.  The closest thing we get to caring is seeing Brando's character exact his vengence on Richard Boone's dapper sadist.There's probably a lot of this movie that was left on the cutting-room floor, because the actors obviously cared.

Hingle ""justkes""","[8, 8]","The death of a major actor usually results in a flurry of sales of his films, but that is not why I wanted this particular film.Mr. Brando often 'walked through' films, giving perfunctory performances at best. He admitted as much during his lifetime.  This is definitely not the case with his portrayal of ""Bud"" in this ensemble cast.  I first saw this film on the big screen as a first release, and was fascinated by the interactions of the characters.The plot revolves around the kidnapping of a young girl and holding her for ransom. The drama is the tensions among the conspirators.  The ending, now a cliche, was relatively new at the time, and MUST be regarded that way.The cast is what makes the film worth watching:  Brando. Richard Boone, upping the bar on his sadistic sinister best (as seen in the previous year's ""Hombre"" with Paul Newman). Rita Moreno, showing the versatility by tackling a part a long way from ""West Side Story."" A very young Pamela Franklin, who five years later starred in the classic thriller ""Legend of Hell House.""  The characters are brought to life by these talented players; no one is quite what he or she seems to be at first.Yes, it's 60s.  Yes, it's quirky.

346613,A30T2B7RFWGYNU,6302937167,FRED C. DOBBS,"[1, 1]","Though lightly regarded among critics and rarely discussed among movie afficionados, NIGHT OF THE FOLLOWING DAY is worth watching. It's a basic kidnap drama but distinctive because of its motley group of kidnappers and enablers and the locale [France]. The tenuous group includes hall-of-famer Marlon Brando as the brains, Rita Moreno [WEST SIDE STORY, 1961] as his drug-using moll, the vastly underrated Richard Boone as the hired gun from Miami, and a guy named Jess Hahn as Moreno's brother? The kidnapee is played by the always pretty-as-a-daisy young British actress Pamela Franklin whose dad has the bucks to merit such a scheme. As in Franklin's later AND SOON THE DARKNESS [1970], another very interesting flick also filmed in France, this one has a a somber, overcast atmosphere conveying a real sense of isolation and melancholy, and it has an annoyingly prying cop whose intermittent queries raise the tension throughout. The group is tight-knit and has planned well and everything seems to be going smoothly until Moreno relaspes into drug use and Boone's lascivious and self-serving interests become evident. Brando's performance is a bit uneven here , with one scene of ostensible overacting [you'll know the scene easily], but it's fun to watch him anyway especially with that incongruous blonde hair! Moreno is excellent---her hissy fit when Brando prohibits further drug use is a gem. The actor who played her 'brother'[?] looked more like Archie Bunker's younger brother than a member of the Moreno gene pool. The show is stolen, though, by the long-underappreciated and GREAT Richard Boone who plays the outsider hired for his pro experience BUT there is one minor problem---he is a psychopath with his own agenda. His narration [on tape] to Franklin's dad of instructions for delivery of the ransom is almost spellbinding. With the group falling apart and Boone imposing his will by threatening to kill everybody if HIS orders are not carried out in a timely fashion, Brando is able to outsmart the lunatic at the end and stop him. Enjoyable seeing this vastly talented group of vets together in a film outside of the US.

An elaborate kidnapping fails because the criminals begin turning on each other.  It's also supposed to be a love story between Brando and the kidnapped young girl, but it missed its mark on that.  Until this movie, I always thought of Richard Boone as &#34;that knight without armor&#34; from Have Gun Will Travel.  He's no knight here.  He is weirdly spectacular as a psycho, sexual sadist.  Subtly scary and bone-chilling, if that makes sense.  His role should have been expanded, and Brando's diminished.  Brando is the least interesting character in this movie.  As always, Rita Moreno is captivating--even as a blonde.",4,Scary Boone,1399766400,"05 11, 2014",2014,762,"['thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'noir', 'little', 'slow-moving', 'times', 'nature', 'film', 'noir', ""1960's/1970"", 'movies', 'elaborate', 'kidnapping', 'fails', 'criminals', 'begin', 'turning', 'other', 'also', 'supposed', 'be', 'love', 'story', 'Brando', 'kidnapped', 'young', 'girl', 'missed', 'mark', 'movie', 'always', 'thought', 'Richard', 'Boone', '34', 'knight', 'armor', '34', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'knight', 'here', 'weirdly', 'spectacular', 'psycho', 'sexual', 'sadist', 'Subtly', 'scary', 'bone-chilling', 'sense', 'role', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'expanded', 'Brando', 'diminished', 'Brando', 'least', 'interesting', 'character', 'movie', 'always', 'Rita', 'Moreno', 'captivating', 'even', 'blonde']",N/A

Brando sort of mails it in on his performance. Richard Boone is a good horny psycho.

346621,A3FH14D2UIY0FG,6302937167,Vampire Truth,"[21, 21]","The DVD of this excellent, overlooked kidnap drama is both mesmerizing and a hoot. The performances are uniformly terrific, with Brando (of course) the standout, and the cinematography is stunning photographically, though director Cornfeld doesn't stage his scenes all that dramatically at times. Still, the movie draws you in thanks to the performances, and by the climax, it's riveting.What makes the DVD particularly delightful is the commentary by Cornfeld, who sounds like he has throat cancer, and who is still pissed off at Brando close to 40 years later. ""He tried to seduce my wife"" Cornfeld says before explaining how Brando refused to let him direct the last scene they shot (it's the one where Brando tells Jess Hahn he's not going through with the plot, and co-star Richard Boone directed it!). For Brando fans, you get an overlooked movie that is far from his worst, featuring trippy 60s cinematography that would be hailed as sheer genius if Steven Soderbergh did it  on an ""Ocean's 11"" sequel. And Cornfeld's insight into the sadism Brando inflicted on so many of his directors is fascinating and repellant all at once.

346622,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6302937167,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","Released in 1968, ""The Night of the Following Day"" is a realistic crime drama featuring Brando as one of four professional criminals who kidnap a girl (a teenage Pamela Franklin) and hold up at a beach house in France. Richard Boone stars as the fiendish member, while Jess Hahn plays a likable loser, the brother of the pathetically drug addicted Rita Moreno.At the time of this picture Brando was 44 years old and never looked better physically -- very trim and blond. Brando didn't start getting fat until the later-70's when he was well into his 50's. In other words, people need to quit envisioning Brando as some fat dude; most of his life he wasn't. Most men in their mid-40's would kill to look as good as Brando did at the this age.BOTTOM LINE: Coming from the mid-60s when realism was fashionable this crime thriller is more of a crime drama, but suspense slowly builds to a compelling final act, which shows that crime doesn't pay, but people are redeemable if they qualify. There's also an unexpected twist that was fresh at the time, but is now eye-rolling.The film was shot during generally cloudy conditions in France and runs a short but sweet 93 minutes.GRADE: B-",4,Crime drama at a beach town in France,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,1180,"['Released', '1968', 'Night', 'Following', 'Day', 'realistic', 'crime', 'drama', 'featuring', 'Brando', 'one', 'four', 'professional', 'criminals', 'who', 'kidnap', 'girl', 'teenage', 'Pamela', 'Franklin', 'hold', 'up', 'beach', 'house', 'France', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'fiendish', 'member', 'Jess', 'Hahn', 'likable', 'loser', 'brother', 'pathetically', 'drug', 'addicted', 'Rita', 'Moreno.At', 'time', 'picture', 'Brando', 'was', '44', 'years', 'old', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'physically', 'very', 'trim', 'blond', 'Brando', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'getting', 'fat', 'later-70', 'when', 'was', 'well', '50', 'other', 'words', 'people', 'need', 'quit', 'envisioning', 'Brando', 'fat', 'dude', 'most', 'life', 'was', ""n't"", 'Most', 'men', 'mid-40', 'would', 'kill', 'look', 'as', 'good', 'Brando', 'did', 'age.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'Coming', 'mid-60s', 'when', 'realism', 'was', 'fashionable', 'crime', 'thriller', 'more', 'crime', 'drama', 'suspense', 'slowly', 'compelling', 'final', 'act', 'crime', ""n't"", 'pay', 'people', 'are', 'redeemable', 'qualify', 'also', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'was', 'fresh', 'time', 'now', 'eye-rolling.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'generally', 'cloudy', 'conditions', 'France', 'short', 'sweet', '93', 'minutes.GRADE', 'B-']",N/A
