968158,A2FTHCGH06O4Y5,B000E5KQMI,Caraculiambro,"[2, 11]","""Magnum P.I."" is probably the best idea for a TV show there ever was, and the fourth season certainly does not disappoint.  Many of the show's most rabid fans insist that the show was at its peak during the fourth season.And this finely-done DVD includes many of the core episodes that made the show so famous.  Here are just some of them:Episode #41:  ""Bow wow ow.""  Zeus and Apollo, Higgins's guard dogs, come down with sarcoptic mange and Magnum must use everything at his disposal to care for them and get them to a mysterious vet on distant Kuai.Episode #42:  ""Errrrrr.""  Magnum, in a bid to test the security of the Masters's estate, sneaks through Higgins's bedroom window and is suprised to find everybody's favorite major-domo prancing about in women's undies.  Hijinks ensue.Episode #43:  ""Senor Bigote.""  Magnum, in a alcoholic cloud, shaves off his famous ""more manly than thou"" moustache.  Zeus and Apollo don't recognize him and he is seriously mauled upon returning to the guest house.  The local animal control has the dogs put to sleep.  Hijinks ensue.Episode #44:  ""By Any Means Necessary.""  T.C., the chummy helicopter pilot, joins the Black Panther party and refuses to ferry Magnum around the islands anymore.Episode #45:  ""Pedal Man.""  Robin Masters gives orders that his Ferrari be repainted a hot pink, eliminating Magnum's desire to drive it around.  Henceforth the private eye must conduct his investigations by rickshaw.  (A lot of fans claim that series really took a nose-dive at this point.)Episode #46:  ""BOOM!""  A volcano long thought dormant erupts on the island.  Millions die.  Hijinks ensue.Episode #47:  ""Aloha Mainland.""

968162,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B000E5KQMI,Craig MACKINNON,"[1, 3]","I suppose every show has its ups and downs, and Magnum had been improving nicely from Season 1 to 3.  Unfortunately, Season 4 takes a step backward, and the shows generally have less heart, less brains, and more of the cheap sitcom-like comedy that lesser shows of the era (A-Team, Simon and Simon, etc.) routinely churned out.  Luckily, Magnum recovered in later seasons.  While there are some genuine gems in the season, there's also a lot of filler.As usual, the best episodes revolve around the entire cast.  Bookending the season are the two best shows.  In the season finale, 'I, Witness,' Magnum tries to piece together conflicting eye-witness accounts of a robbery at the King Kamehameha Club.  The catch: the three eyewitnesses are Rick, T.C., and Higgins.  It plays on the way that each character sees himself (i.e. as the heroic one) and each of the others (likeable but deeply flawed).  However, it's the first episode, 'Home From the Sea,' that is possibly the best show of the series.  In time-honoured Magnum tradition, each of Higgins, Rick, and T.C. sense that Magnum is in trouble when he is almost run over by a speedboat, loses his surfski, and winds up in a strong ocean current pulling him away from land.  To keep himself occupied while awaiting rescue, Magnum carries on a running monologue with his deceased father, killed in Korea when Magnum was only 10.  We see scenes of Magnum's childhood in flashback, where he is portrayed surprisingly effectively by a young actor.  Another key moment, for me, is how it portrays the trust between all the characters - they may bicker constantly, but when the chips are down, T.C. has no problem with Higgins jumping out of his chopper with a life preserver for Magnum.Overall, the characters in the series do grow, especially Agatha, who appears in several episodes, and District Attorney Carol Marcus.  Carol ends up being the perfect foil for Magnum (although she can be overused), being the only one able to manipulate Magnum into doing things for her, the same way he manipulates Rick and T.C.  The continuing expansion and elaboration of the supporting cast makes the later seasons all the better, it's just too bad the writing is not the greatest in this particular season.",3,The good episodes are fewer and farther between in Season 4,1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,2246,"['suppose', 'show', 'ups', 'downs', 'Magnum', 'had', 'been', 'improving', 'nicely', 'Season', '1', '3', 'Unfortunately', 'Season', '4', 'step', 'backward', 'shows', 'generally', 'have', 'less', 'heart', 'less', 'brains', 'more', 'cheap', 'sitcom-like', 'comedy', 'lesser', 'shows', 'era', 'A-Team', 'Simon', 'Simon', 'etc', 'routinely', 'churned', 'out', 'Luckily', 'Magnum', 'recovered', 'later', 'seasons', 'are', 'genuine', 'gems', 'season', 'also', 'lot', 'filler.As', 'usual', 'best', 'episodes', 'revolve', 'entire', 'cast', 'Bookending', 'season', 'are', 'two', 'best', 'shows', 'season', 'finale', 'Witness', 'Magnum', 'tries', 'piece', 'together', 'conflicting', 'eye-witness', 'accounts', 'robbery', 'King', 'Kamehameha', 'Club', 'catch', 'three', 'eyewitnesses', 'are', 'Rick', 'T.C.', 'Higgins', 'way', 'character', 'i.e', 'heroic', 'one', 'others', 'likeable', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'However', 'first', 'episode', 'Sea', 'possibly', 'best', 'show', 'series', 'time-honoured', 'Magnum', 'tradition', 'Higgins', 'Rick', 'T.C', 'sense', 'Magnum', 'trouble', 'when', 'almost', 'run', 'over', 'speedboat', 'surfski', 'up', 'strong', 'ocean', 'current', 'pulling', 'away', 'land', 'keep', 'occupied', 'awaiting', 'rescue', 'Magnum', 'running', 'monologue', 'deceased', 'father', 'killed', 'Korea', 'when', 'Magnum', 'was', 'only', '10', 'see', 'scenes', 'Magnum', 'childhood', 'flashback', 'where', 'portrayed', 'surprisingly', 'effectively', 'young', 'actor', 'key', 'moment', 'how', 'trust', 'characters', 'may', 'bicker', 'constantly', 'when', 'chips', 'are', 'down', 'T.C', 'problem', 'Higgins', 'jumping', 'chopper', 'life', 'preserver', 'Magnum.Overall', 'characters', 'series', 'do', 'grow', 'especially', 'Agatha', 'who', 'several', 'episodes', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Carol', 'Marcus', 'Carol', 'up', 'being', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Magnum', 'can', 'be', 'overused', 'being', 'only', 'one', 'able', 'manipulate', 'Magnum', 'doing', 'things', 'same', 'way', 'Rick', 'T.C', 'continuing', 'expansion', 'elaboration', 'supporting', 'cast', 'later', 'seasons', 'better', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'writing', 'not', 'greatest', 'particular', 'season']",Magnum P.I.: The Complete Fourth Season

968166,A6A38ESR48ZPK,B000E5KQMI,"grundle2600 ""grundle2600""","[93, 109]","Magnum P.I is my favorite TV show of all time.My original plan was to buy all 8 seasons on DVD.However, with the releases of the first 3 seasons, Universal has repeatedly released DVDs with a very high rate of defects. Many people on many different internet message boards, including myself, have been complaining about lots of problems on these DVDs, such as pixelating, freezing, skipping, etc. Some of the episodes are unplayable. Even after multiple exchanges at the place of purchase, some people still can't get a set that plays properly. These are manufacturing defects. Universal has been repeatedly informed of these defects, but has chosen to do nothing about it.I own the first 3 seasons. But I'm done buying this show on DVD. Withholding my money from Universal is the only real way to express my disappointment with the defective DVDs. I won't be buying seasons 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.My 1 star rating is for the high rate of defects on these DVDs. If it weren't for the defects, I'd be giving this a 5 star rating.Here are the episodes from season 4:Home From The Sea - This is my #1 favorite episode of the entire series. I won't spoil it for you by revealing any of the plot. But I will say this: if you've ever seen the episode where Magnum treads water, this is it. This is a very emotionally intense episode. You know those big guys with the bulging muscles and the tattoos who claim they never cry? If you show them this episode, I bet they will cry. If you want to introduce the series to someone (of any size, age, or gender) who has never seen it before, this is the episode to show them. One thing that I love about this episode is the way that the dialogue at the end of every scene transitions into the dialogue at the beginning of the next scene, even though the two scenes are apparently totally unrelated. This episode is a masterpiece of writing, acting, directing, camera work, editing, and musical scoring. This episode is perfect. I think this may be the only G-rated episode of the series, as it has absolutely no violence, sex, or foul language. ""You turkeys!!!""Luther Gillis File 521 - Luther Gillis appeared in 5 episodes, and it's extremely easy to get them confused with each other. This is the first of those 5.Smaller Than Life - An old friend of Rick's appears in this episode. But even Rick isn't completely sure as to his identity. Apparently, the friend may or may not be some kind of secret government agent. This episode has a really great scene of Rick, Higgins, and Rick's friend secretly entering a building.Distant Relative - Rick talks Magnum into chaperoning his 22 year old sister. Rick isn't too pleased with the outcome, and he ends up punching Magnum in the jaw. This is one of the best episodes of this season.Limited Engagement - Magnum works undercover to solve a string of robberies at a chain of grocery stores. Magnum also acts as a social worker to try to save some old people from being evicted from their retirement home. This episode is lighthearted and sappy, but it's not a totally bad episode. There are a few good scenes, such as T.C. repeatedly asking Magnum to fish pickled eggs out of a disgusting jar of brine, and then saying, ""Oh dear me! I do believe that I've forgotten my wallet!""Letter To A Duchess - A British woman is visiting the estate. Higgins writes her an anonymous love note. She mistakenly assumes the note is from Magnum. This episode is OK. But it's nowhere nearly as good as the brilliant ""Tropical Madness"" episode from season 2, which this episode kind of reminds me of.Squeeze Play - Robin Masters makes a bet on a baseball game that Magnum is playing in. If Magnum's team loses, Robin has to give up the estate for a year to the owner of the other team. And that includes the guest house. So Magnum better win!A Sense Of Debt - Several years before she played Brenda on ""Beverly Hills 90210,"" Shannen Doherty appeared on this episode of Magnum P.I., where she brainwashed Zeus and Apollo into forgetting what their names are. Higgins is not amused.The Look - Magnum visits a disc jockey in Hawaii that he knew from his time in Vietnam.Operation Silent Night - On Christmas eve, Magnum, T.C., Rick, and Higgins are stranded on an island that the navy is planning to use for gunnery practice. This is one of my favorite episodes of this season.Jororo Farewell - The season 2 episode ""The Jororo Kill"" is one of my favorite episodes of the series. This inferior season 4 episode brings back some of the same characters, but this time, the plot is pretty bad. A young prince runs away from home because he wants to be a regular boy instead of a prince. Another lame episode with Magnum as a social worker.The Case Of The Red Faced Thespian - This is a really cool episode with many pop culture references. This one's a lot of fun. Higgins is planning a party with a 1920s/Great Gatsby theme. In preparation, he uses miniature explosives to try to kill some rodents that have dug tunnels under the estate. But like Wyle E. Coyote trying to kill the Road Runner, Higgins ends up giving himself a concussion. When the party does take place, Magnum walks into one of the bedrooms, and sees a woman lying dead on the bed. Higgins is standing there, dressed in Shakespearean clothing, and reciting a confessional line from Othello, ""Desdemona, Dead! I killed her!"" Magnum has to prove that Higgins is innocent, and that his ""confession"" is the result of his concussion combined with his obsession with Shakespeare, and not from actually having committed the murder.No More Mr. Nice Guy - Magnum tries to catch a drug dealer.Rembrandt's Girl - Hooray for guest Carol Burnett, who is a phenomenally amazing actress, and always gives an absolutely brilliant performance! Boo for the lame, cliche, and unoriginal script, which has Magnum and Burnett getting locked inside a bank vault! Fortunately, Burnett would return to play the same character in the season 8 episode ""A Girl Named Sue,"" which has a much better script than this one. In that season 8 episode, Burnett has gotten her own license as a private investigator, and she and Magnum unknowingly get into a shootout against each other!Paradise Blues - A jazz/pop singer that T.C. had been infatuated with many years ago comes to visit. She has a beautiful voice, full of emotion, conviction, and style. It's a true joy to listen to her sing. There's lots of great music in this one. However, I really hate the way the episode ends. What were the writers thinking?The Return Of Luther Gillis - Higgins gets kidnapped. He's held hostage in a trailer with a bomb that's set to go off.Let The Punishment Fit The Crime- This is the episode with the performance from the Mikado of ""Three Little Girls From School Are We.""Holmes Is Where The Heart Is - Higgins recalls events of his life before he met Magnum, with a touch of Sherlock Homes added for fun.On Face Value - Usually, Magnum is the epitome of proper gun use and safety. But not in this episode. And an innocent person suffers serious consequences as a result of Magnum's irresponsible actions.Dream A Little Dream - Magnum recalls his first case as a private investigator, before he moved into the estate. After T.C.'s chopper gets bullet holes for the first time, Magnum says, ""I promise that that will never happen again.""I Witness - Great Roshomon type episode. After the King Kamehameha Club is robbed by masked men, Magnum listens to T.C., Rick, and Higgins each give their own unique account of what happened. Magnum has to piece their stories together to find a common element so he can catch the thief. This is a very humorous episode, as each teller of the story embellishes it to make himself out to be the hero, and to make the others out to be cowards.",1,5 stars for the TV season. 1 star for the

I have had absolutely no problems with my discs and would recommend that anyone who wants season 3 to go ahead and order it.  It's ashame that apparantly Universal ran inferior quality discs of season 3 in the past and I think they should step up to the plate and send those disappointed in the past with new ones immediately for no charge or at an extremely discounted price for the inconvenience caused.,5,Magnum PI Season 3,1251417600,"08 28, 2009",2009,552,"['have', 'recently', 'purchased', 'Magnum', 'PI', 'Seasons', '1-3', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'am', 'puzzled', 'earlier', 'comments', 'regarding', 'season', '3', 'have', 'had', 'absolutely', 'problems', 'discs', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'season', '3', 'go', 'ahead', 'order', 'ashame', 'apparantly', 'Universal', 'ran', 'inferior', 'quality', 'discs', 'season', '3', 'past', 'think', 'should', 'step', 'up', 'plate', 'send', 'disappointed', 'past', 'new', 'ones', 'immediately', 'charge', 'extremely', 'discounted', 'price', 'inconvenience', 'caused']",Magnum P.I.: The Complete Fourth Season
968168,A3H9PLV6L2S194,B000E5KQMI,Jim Davis,"[2, 2]","Magnum, PI is in its essentials about a man who sees the oncoming train of approaching middle age and flees the station. He is enabled in this by landing a dream ""job"" which doesn't really entail him having to work unless he really wants to. His friends indulge him and his fellow estate resident despairs of him.Magnum, PI had a lot going for it - likable characters (a must for any show I watch), exotic locale, good writing, and on screen talent that could make it all work. It's a hard show to pigeonhole - it can swing from comedy to action to drama to tragedy - sometimes in the same episode.The centerpiece of the show is the relationship between Magnum and Higgins - Higgins obviously likes Magnum but just can't bring himself to approve of Magnum's infuriating irresponsibility. Magnum for his part likes Higgins but just can't understand why he worries about things Magnum considers unimportant. The development of this relationship is a joy to watch. The relationship between Magnum and his much put upon friends Rick and TC is much more longstanding and stable.Season 4 offers 21 episodes and 1 bonus episode from season 5. All that is not excellent is very good. There is nary a loser in the bunch - my least favorite is ""Jororo Farewell"".I dock this collection a single star based on production values. Double sided DVDs are a crime against nature although mine played fine with only occasional artifacting. There has also been a slip in value as there are no on disc episode summaries, original air dates, or scene selections as there were for previous seasons. In addition to the season 5 bonus episode already mentioned there is a ""The Great '80s TV Flashback"" feature describing other (presumably Universal) TV shows available on DVD.If you're new to Magnum starting at season 1 would be advisable since there is a certain amount of continuity that carries forward but nothing that would prevent you from enjoying this season. If you've already worked your way through seasons 1, 2, and 3 this is more of the same great stuff.

968170,A2KTHPGHWB8BUU,B000E5KQMI,"Jon Warshawsky ""Sinatra Guru""","[39, 40]","I'm happy to report my Fourth Season DVDs played fine. More importantly, the series really comes into its own during its fourth year on the air. While most programs designed for an hour slot, Magnum and Higgins' characters have enough depth to them that each hour is something of a glimpse into their lives. In particular, you can't watch this season without appreciating something about Magnum's past influences, his father, author Raymond Chandler, Agatha Christie and others. While all of this is wrapped in the sometimes dated trappings of an '80s TV show, a lot of the substance of the show survives.This season includes what may be the best hour of television writing of its era, the Home from the Sea episode. As another reviewer mentioned, this is the ""treading water"" episode and it cemented many viewers' bond with Selleck's character. No staged fist fights, no explosions, no Ferrari chases. Not many episodes come close to this.Other memorable episodes include Distant Relative, which focuses on Rick, Rick's sister and Magnum as a ""babysitter"" for a not-too-innocent twentysomething. Letter To A Duchess, in which Higgins has a crush on a British woman who falls for Magnum, also stands out: all the right sets, enough action, and it illuminates the Magnum-Higgins relationship that turns out to be the show's core.Vietnam always lurks not far below the surface in the series, and The Look is an interesting (but dated) tie in to Magnum's past, with a female disc jockey who plays a role similar to Tyne Daly's female-friend-in-Vietnam from the excellent ""Jororo Kill"" episode in season two.Another brilliant episode: Operation Silent Night, in which the main characters are marooned on Christmas Eve on an island used for Navy gunnery practice. By this point in the series, the writers no longer had to rely on props like the Ferrari and the bikini babes at the King Kamehameha Club to make it work.On Face Value also rises to the top. An unexpected twist in a car chase puts Magnum into a wrenching situation, possibly the most affecting since Vietnam. An intense 'hour', all about character and inner struggle, with amazing performances by Selleck and Hillerman (Higgins). Overshadowed only by Home from the Sea.The fourth season includes some of the best, and some lesser material -- although even the Luther Gillis episodes have their moments.

968181,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B000E5KQMI,Taheen Lopez,"[1, 2]","MAGNUM's 1983-84 Season is only a so-so season, because it wasn't as good as the first 3 seasons of this private detective drama and it seemed almost as if they were trying to make it too much like the 3rd Season of MAGNUM, PI because the action seemed to have started getting a less & less interesting for a while until MAGNUM hit it's 6th Season on CBS, especially since the honeymoon phase of this show was already long gone by the time this detective drama hit off its 4th Season in the Fall of 1984.It was interesting seeing guest stars like*Carol Burnett in the ""Rembrandt's Girl"" episode*Robert Pine in the ""Dad"" episode after his co-starring days as Ponch & Jon's hard-nosed superior officer(Sgt. Joe Getraer) on CHiPs.*Gretchen Corbett in ""The Look"" episode after her co-starring days as the often fastidious Jim Rockford's foxy attorney girlfriend(Beth Davenport)on THE ROCKFORD FILES*Shannon Doherty before her co-starring days as the sleazy rebellious bad girl(Brenda Walsh) on BEVERLY HILLS 90210 and her Christine Witherspoon days on OUR HOUSE*Robert Ito in ""The Jororo Farewell"" episode after his co-starring days on QUINCY M.E.*Deborah Pratt in the ""Rembrandt's Girl"" episode during her co-starring days as Marilla on AIRWOLF*Cindy Pickett in the ""Dream A Little Dream"" episode during her co-starring days on ST. ELSEWHERESo now that Universal has all 8 seasons of MAGNUM on DVD, I'm hoping this has inspired Warner Bros. to finally release the detective drama MATT HOUSTON on DVD soon, since MATT HOUSTON was a pretty cool private detective show too that was in competition with MAGNUM, P.I. throughout MATT HOUSTON's whole 3-year run on CBS's rival network ABC, not to mention that Matt Houston(Lee Horseley) had a slight resemeblence to Thomas Magnum(Tom Selleck) except Magnum was a world-class private investigator and beach-bum who lived on a shoe-string budget rent-free at the so-called Robin Masters estate in Honolulu, Hawaii and was always broke unlike Houston who was a wealthy private detective who was never broke and lived high on the hog in a ritzy penhouse in Hollywood and always had sexy women around him living the kind of lifestyle that Magnum would've liked to have had since Magnum was constantly outclassed by Houston and always struggling to make a living & barely able to stay afloat, but Houston was a filthy-rich playboy from Texas who moved to the L.A. Area to take over a family business overseas and ran a detective agency on the side as a hobby with some help from his foxy sidekick CJ Parsons(Pamela Hensley)previously known for her role as the relentless Princess Ardala on BUCK ROGERS.Something I couldn't help finding odd about MAGNUM's 4th Season was in ""The Jororo Farewell"" the character Ed Russler was played by John Saxon, but in ""The Jororo Kill"" episode from the 2nd Season, the Russler character was portrayed by Burr DeBenning, even though it was so-called the same person and same character since the Russler character was supposedly coming back for a second appearance on the show 2 years later after his first appearance back in January of 1982 when ""The Jororo Kill"" episodes original air-date(1/7/82) on CBS was.MAGNUM's 1983-1984 Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to the days when I was 11 years old and still living in my hometown(El Centro, CA) since I was living in the Imperial Valley at the time, which by the way is a small secluded desert community with nothing to do for fun or entertainment, unless of course you're married or a cop.In the meantime, I just got word that Paramount will fortunately finally be releasing MATT HOUSTON out on DVD on March 9th, 2010 which shall be exciting news for all MATT HOUSTON and MAGNUM fans since MATT HOUSTON was a very popular private detective drama from the 80's just like MAGNUM was.",3,A Less Than Exceptional Season,1227484800,"11 24, 2008",2008,3820,"['MAGNUM', '1983-84', 'Season', 'only', 'so-so', 'season', 'was', ""n't"",

Sure, I liked it when it was on... but come 1984, my interests shifted over toMiami Vice: The Complete Seriesand they never returned. Oh I still watched.. but to be completely honest, I never really cared that much if the show was on or not.But...When the Season Four premier episode entitled HOME FROM THE SEA first aired on 29 September 1983, I - like many other viewers - was treated to one of the most moving episodes of the entire Magnum P.I. series. I must admit that I only ever saw that episode one time... on the day it first aired... but it stuck with me for over twenty-three years. HOME FROM THE SEA was the only episode from the entire series that I vividly remembered for all of that time. It was the one episode that I told anyone and everyone about. It was the one episode that I tried and tried to catch when the show went into syndication. I never found it. So when Universal started releasing the series on DVD, I searched and I waited.I purchased this boxed set FOR THAT EPISODE AND THAT EPISODE ONLY. And that episode alone warrants the five star rating. I cannot stress enough the impact this one show had on my psyche. I simply never stopped thinking about it. Just watch it and you will understand. I cried and so did my Wife.I am sure that I will enjoy watching the rest of Season Four, and that may even cause me to want to buy some of the other Seasons. But all I really wanted is HOME FROM THE SEA, and now I have it. It only took twenty-three years for me to find it. I doubt if even Thomas Magnum could tread water for that long. If you are even remotely a Magnum P.I. fan, this is the Season you want because this is the Season with HOME FROM THE SEA.From [...]""It's the 4th of July, and Higgins is playing in a polo match, T.C. is taking his baseball team to a professional game, Rick is out with his latest girlfriend on the King Kamehameha II yacht, and Thomas is observing his annual Independence Day tradition of a solitary day at sea -- until his surf ski is capsized in the wake of a recklessly driven speedboat and set adrift. Carried off further and further away from land by the powerful Molokai Channel, Thomas relies on childhood memories of his father's training him to tread water to keep himself afloat as he struggles desperately to stay above water and fend off a menacing shark. As the hours pass, Higgins, T.C. and Rick each have a sixth sense that Thomas is in trouble, and they team up to rescue him. Thomas approaches the twenty-four hour mark in the water recalling his wedding to Michelle and his father's burial -- on July 4, 1951 -- as Higgins scoops him out of the ocean, with T.C. in his helicopter overhead and Rick on the yacht nearby.""",5,"""I made it Dad... why didn't you?""",1231804800,"01 13, 2009",2009,2765,"['OK', 'am', 'not', 'biggest', 'Magnum', 'P.I', 'fan', 'ever', 'watch', 'show', 'Sure', 'liked', 'when', 'was', 'come', '1984', 'interests', 'shifted', 'toMiami', 'Vice', 'Complete', 'Seriesand', 'never', 'returned', 'Oh', 'still', 'watched..', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'never', 'really', 'cared', 'much', 'show', 'was', 'not.But', 'When', 'Season', 'Four', 'premier', 'episode', 'entitled', 'HOME', 'FROM', 'THE', 'SEA', 'first', 'aired', '29', 'September', '1983', 'many', 'other', 'viewers', 'was', 'treated', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'episodes', 'entire', 'Magnum', 'P.I', 'series', 'must', 'admit', 'only', 'ever', 'saw', 'episode', 'one', 'time', 'day', 'first', 'aired', 'stuck', 'twenty-three', 'years', 'HOME', 'THE', 'SEA', 'was', 'only', 'episode', 'entire', 'series', 'vividly', 'remembered', 'time', 'was', 'one', 'episode', 'told', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'about', 'was', 'one', 'episode', 'tried', 'tried', 'catch', 'when', 'show', 'went', 'syndication', 'never', 'found', 'So', 'when', 'Universal', 'started', 'releasing', 'series', 'DVD', 'searched', 'waited.I', 'purchased', 'boxed', 'set', 'EPISODE', 'THAT', 'EPISODE', 'ONLY', 'episode', 'alone', 'warrants', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'impact', 'one', 'show', 'had', 'psyche', 'simply', 'never', 'stopped', 'thinking', 'Just', 'watch', 'will', 'understand', 'cried', 'so', 'did', 'Wife.I', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'rest', 'Season', 'Four', 'may', 'even', 'cause', 'want', 'buy', 'other', 'Seasons', 'really', 'wanted', 'HOME', 'FROM', 'THE', 'SEA', 'now', 'have', 'only', 'took', 'twenty-three', 'years', 'find', 'doubt', 'even', 'Thomas', 'Magnum', 'could', 'tread', 'water', 'long', 'are', 'even', 'remotely', 'Magnum', 'P.I', 'fan', 'Season', 'want', 'Season', 'HOME', 'FROM', 'THE', 'SEA.From', '[', ']', '4th', 'July', 'Higgins', 'playing', 'polo', 'match', 'T.C', 'taking', 'baseball', 'team', 'professional', 'game', 'Rick', 'out', 'latest', 'girlfriend', 'King', 'Kamehameha', 'II', 'yacht', 'Thomas', 'observing', 'annual', 'Independence', 'Day', 'tradition', 'solitary', 'day', 'sea', 'surf', 'ski', 'capsized', 'wake', 'recklessly', 'driven', 'speedboat', 'set', 'adrift', 'Carried', 'further', 'further', 'away', 'land', 'powerful', 'Molokai', 'Channel', 'Thomas', 'childhood', 'memories', 'father', 'training', 'tread', 'water', 'keep', 'afloat', 'desperately', 'stay', 'water', 'fend', 'off', 'menacing', 'shark', 'hours', 'pass', 'Higgins', 'T.C', 'Rick', 'have', 'sixth', 'sense', 'Thomas', 'trouble', 'team', 'up', 'rescue', 'Thomas', 'twenty-four', 'hour', 'mark', 'water', 'recalling', 'wedding', 'Michelle', 'father', 'burial', 'July', '4', '1951', 'Higgins', 'ocean', 'T.C', 'helicopter', 'overhead', 'Rick', 'yacht', 'nearby']",Magnum P.I.: The Complete Fourth Season
