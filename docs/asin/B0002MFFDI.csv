840070,AJJBIXVL2U8FP,B0002MFFDI,"Benjamin Mcnully ""Movie Idiot""","[8, 8]","I'm writing this while watching the movie. And really, I'm not missing a whole lot.The movie starts with a young woman asleep. She begins to writhe and squirm, and then a womans seductively goes between her legs. And bares her TEETH. Wow. She bolts awake. Her dad is driving somewhere, and turns to her to and says 'Whats wrong? Nightmare?' and she goes 'THE nightmare again'. Then, they hit a zombie on the road. Yea, 'what?' indeed.In the first ten minutes you'll understand whats going to happen throughout, and things only get more awesome-er-ish.There are many things to point out, that are worth your time: First, is the plot. What would happen if people became infected with zombie viruses, and vampires were... also there? Look no further. Second, the General. Who even thought this guy up? I will strive my whole life to be even half as cool as the General. From my favorite line (said with a laugh) ""All right... Zombie [...]"" Also, they call becoming a vampire ""The Bite"". How original, and.... obvious!So, this father-daughter (travis and jenna) team go on a magical journey to survive. When they meet a mysterious stranger, they agree to add one to their party, the 'daughter' of Camilla. Camilla is something more than she seems, and carries a strange power (or something). THE BITE!!!! Until, we meet the General! This grizzly old guy is the baddest bad [...] that ever ball kicked. He calls Travis frequently, and they conspire to find Carmilla and her vampire [...] squad. They meet a zombie, driving along merrily. They kill him, take his jeep and split up. The two girls head out together. The girl they've picked up starts getting it on with jenna. Lesbians AND zombies?! Yea, and she even goes 'I have my period' suddenly and for no reason. And the other girl tells jenna 'go over there or do it here, I don't care'. Yep.Then: FLASHBACK!Oh, and can I remind you: No zombies have fought any vampires yet. At all. Afterwards, they find a zombie... with a stake in his chest. They Continue onward, till they reach... A fully populated cuty, complete with traffic. Inside a convent, they get attacked by killer zombie schoolgirls. And a vampire school girl, who has ren and stimpy sound effects. The Colonel punches girls whenever he wants, and even trys to kill Travis. And... then his daughter gives him The Bite. After a ten minute stand off, Jenna saves him using TAPE. Yes, you stand corrected, tape can do anything. Including kill Vampires. The ending is great. True style. Trust me.Overall, this movie got a middle of the road rating, 3.5 (if only) because of it's quality. But the Colonel bumped it to a 4. The story makes up for the other stuff. But here itis:Picture sucks. After school special at best. Also, the lighting is terrible. Some of the shots are day when they are supposed to be night, and they only use a dark filter to create this effect. And as for visual effects, there are NONE. Blood looks like chicken blood, or tobacco chew.Sound was terribly muddy, and the effects [...] Some of them are actually from DOOM. The game. For Windows 3.5...Special features are nearly non existent.First up is 'Heads are gonna roll', nearly the best part of the disc. Almost as little talent acting and the same amount of story. I don't even know why this was made, unless it was a Tarantino thing. Then it would be world famous and people would say 'it changed my life'. Despite it being pointless.The rest of the features include dual audio tracks, trailers, and scene selection. I would love to hear directors commentary, especially after reading someones note that this film took six months to PLAN. As though you'd ever be able to tell.Final Thought: Notice how there's still no vampires FIGHTING zombies? You wouldn't be able to notice.

840071,A16AR1AKHPUSSE,B0002MFFDI,"Jessi ""Queen of the Zombies""","[0, 2]","I would give this movie half a star, but that's not an option. The zombies (which weren't that many) looked like they were covered in brown/green slime at the bottom of some nasty pond and the fangs looked like Trident gum stuck on teeth after having the edges cut to a point. The script was SO bad I couldn't even laugh. The sound effects totally came out of Ren & Stimpy and I'm guessing a two year old was in charge of the lighting.I think it had a plot, but I wasn't exactly sure what was going on. There were odd flashbacks and twisted hallucinations done by the vampires (those who received ""the bite"" like that's a few phrase or something.) It was really hard to tell what was a flashback and what was ""really"" happening, which really wasn't much, so missing what's going on in the plot doesn't matter.The acting reminded me a lot of soap operas, where they're always repeating each other's name (probably so the viewers remember the characters before we find out who's sleeping with who's brother's uncle's dog groomer's roommate) and they try to make these dramatic pauses which look more like they forgot their lines.Actually, the script was done more like a porno: it really didn't matter and the acting isn't even worth belly button lint, probably because some chick's shirt came off and there was some lesbian action.The blood looked like it came out of those pills little kids bite into on Halloween when they're a vapire and they want to make it look like they had a recent kill.NEWSFLASH: That's cute on kids, but NOT in a movie, unless it's a little kid dressed up as a vampire.The zombie population was sparse. They made an appearance by getting hit by a car, having someone poke at one of them, zombie kids trying to kill off the vampire chicks, and at the end. I wouldn't really call them zombies though. They looked more like fake walking mold experiments.And can someone tell me what was up with the chick at the gas station?The General was cool though. Props to him.It should have been called ""Attack of the Airhead Lesbian Vampires.""To those horror fans out there, don't even bother. It's not even like the remake of ""The Blob"" which was funny. The only two things this movie is good for is putting you to sleep and realizing that anyone with a video camera can make ""a movie.""And to clarify things, vampires and zombies don't fight at all.",1,Vampires vs...uh...I forgot,1119830400,"06 27, 2005",2005,2364,"['would', 'give', 'movie', 'star', 'not', 'option', 'zombies', 'were', ""n't"", 'many', 'looked', 'were', 'covered', 'brown/green', 'slime', 'bottom', 'nasty', 'pond', 'fangs', 'looked', 'Trident', 'gum', 'stuck', 'teeth', 'having', 'edges', 'cut', 'point', 'script', 'was', 'SO', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'laugh', 'sound', 'effects', 'totally', 'came', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'was', 'charge', 'lighting.I', 'think', 'had', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'were', 'odd', 'flashbacks', 'twisted', 'hallucinations', 'done', 'vampires', 'who', 'received', 'bite', 'few', 'phrase', 'something', 'was', 'really', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', 'was', 'flashback', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'happening', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'so', 'missing', 'what', 'going', 'plot', ""n't"", 'matter.The', 'acting', 'reminded', 'lot', 'soap', 'operas', 'where', ""'re"", 'always', 'repeating', 'other', 'name', 'probably', 'so', 'viewers', 'remember', 'characters', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'sleeping', 'who', 'brother', 'uncle', 'dog', 'groomer', 'roommate', 'try', 'make', 'dramatic', 'pauses', 'look', 'more', 'forgot', 'lines.Actually', 'script', 'was', 'done', 'more', 'porno', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'acting', ""n't"", 'even', 'worth', 'belly', 'button', 'lint', 'probably', 'chick', 'shirt', 'came', 'off', 'was', 'lesbian', 'action.The', 'blood', 'looked', 'came', 'pills', 'little', 'kids', 'bite', 'Halloween', 'when', ""'re"", 'vapire', 'want', 'make', 'look', 'had', 'recent', 'kill.NEWSFLASH', 'cute', 'kids', 'NOT', 'movie', 'little', 'kid', 'dressed', 'up', 'vampire.The', 'zombie', 'population', 'was', 'sparse', 'made', 'appearance', 'getting', 'hit', 'car', 'having', 'someone', 'poke', 'one', 'trying', 'kill', 'off', 'vampire', 'chicks', 'end', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'call', 'zombies', 'looked', 'more', 'fake', 'walking', 'mold', 'experiments.And', 'can', 'someone', 'tell', 'was', 'up', 'chick', 'gas', 'station', 'General', 'was', 'cool', 'Props', 'him.It', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Attack', 'Airhead', 'Lesbian', 'Vampires', 'horror', 'fans', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'not', 'even', 'remake', 'Blob', 'was', 'funny', 'only', 'two', 'things', 'movie', 'good', 'putting', 'sleep', 'realizing', 'anyone', 'video', 'camera', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'clarify', 'things', 'vampires', 'zombies', 'do', ""n't"", 'fight']",N/A
840072,A39LNONCVKQCS3,B0002MFFDI,Murry D.,"[11, 14]","This is a sadly misunderstood film because everyone is taking it too literally; it is actually a powerful and deliberate statement about postmodernism.  A critic might say, ""Why does a movie called 'Vampires Vs. Zombies' have no fighting between vampires and zombies?""  The decision to use this title is a brave indictment of marketing and how it affects our preconceptions; it proves the postmodnernist thought that everything is relative to one's viewpoint.  It is not well known, but auteur Vince D'Amato originally considered the title ""Lesbian Vampire Boogaloo"" but eventually settled on its current title to emphasize his point.  And speaking of lesbianism, the film is also a bold statement about relative sexuality, since every last woman in this movie is a lesbian.  Critics say the cars are driving at 5 kph (it was filmed in Canada) due to a limited budget and filming locations, however, this was a deliberate choice to show the relative passage of time and distance according to one's perception.  The incomprehensible flashbacks are an ingenious way of showing the fickleness of human memory, and the ambiguousness in the mental hospital scenes is a shining example of the distrust we should exercise over our own senses.  The existence and under-utilization of the few zombies in the movie with no explanation at all or even surprise by the characters is a striking portrait of how events outside our control--even events as large as a zombie apocalypse--are beyond meaningful comprehension.  I could try to explain more of the meanings behind the interactions of the main characters, but there is none--and that is the point!  For instance, when the father of the converted lesbian vampire has a wooden stake through his shoulder and is soaked in blood, she calmly asks, ""Is everything all right?""  I was simply blown away by the postmodern implications of this statement.  You'll just have to see this movie for yourself.With such a philosophically challenging film I can see how its greatness has yet to be recognized.  I believe that within a few years this will be hailed as the first great postmodern horror flick.

A load of bull is all I can say. The characters are loose and have no developement whatsoever. Zombies and Vampires do not even come face to face in this movie. I dont think there even were any zombies. It was extremely cheap and the production quality itself was terrible. Lighting was bad and the movie had NO real storyline. Nothing made sense not even the stupid ending. The effects are even worse. If your expecting gore like George Romero or a scare like Dario Argento your looking at the total opposite. The goe is horrible I tell you. You dont ever see the process of the killing instead you see the outcome. For example at the end someone dies. The whole room is filled with zombies and the zombie throws someone on the bed. Then the scene switches to her stomach open. No sense at all.

Well, there's one point where perhaps that is what is happening, but it's not very clear. The only clear thing about this movie is the fact that it is a total piece of crap. Seriously, your average shoestring budget porno has better production values. At a few points in the film, the only lighting is that of a flashlight wielded by a character. And I'm sure their budget was very small, because at one point, while our two lesbian leads (the movie is very loosely based on the Sheridan Le Fanu classic ""Carmilla"") are driving their jeep down a dirt road, the car is obviously being pushed, because I don't think cars can drive that slowly. I suppose the slowspeed chase made it possible for a cameraman to walk alongside for a better view of the ""erotic"" shenanigans.Personally, I think the movie is a steaming, festering pile of dog feces, but my hubby thinks it's the funniest thing he's ever seen.

840077,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0002MFFDI,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Please take a look at the DVD cover of ""Vampires vs. Zombies,"" and you will notice that two scary creatures are facing each other like ""Alien vs. Predator."" Probably someone thought of renaming this cheap zombie flick, trying to cash in on ""AVP"" which is not a great film, but at least honest about its content. In this ultra-low budget ""Vampires vs. Zombies"" you see no battle between zombies and vampires. All you see is two guys, old and middle-aged, and three or four ladies (some with false teeth), all driving cars somewhere in the woods or roaming in the poorly-lighted building, not knowing what to do, saying whatever nonsense you don't care.Frankly I don't know what I should write about its thin story. A young woman and her daddy are traveling in a car. The radio is talking about some terrible, very terrible news like outbreak of `zombie disease' or something, and suddenly a weird-looking guy appears before their car, and BOOM! They hit the guy, whose head is rolling on the ground, but hey, it's OK because that's only a zombie! Am I supposed to be scared?After that they pick up a girl named Carmilla, who turns out a vampire. And there is some old guy called `The General,' George C Scott look-alike who is looking for Carmilla. That far I could understand, but the rest of the story is so muddled and confusing that I started to lose interest in whatever they say or do, except some brief nudity and chopping off the heads. And they are not much fun.The film's opening credits include the name of the 19the century Irish writer Sheridan Le Fanu, and the film claims that his classic vampire story `Carmilla' is the basis of the film. OK, to be fair, the filmmakers seem to have read the original. It is certain there are some scenes or elements in story that faintly resemble this well-known story - female traveler leaving her `daughter' behind, etc. - but my impression is just this: ""So what?"" Probably yours will be the same.Everything in this `film' is amateurish - editing, acting and lighting, everything.
