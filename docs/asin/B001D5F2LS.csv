It was always funny when they bleeped the 7 words, but if they did that to this DVD, all that you would hear is bleep, bleep, bleep. George seem to try to put as much F#@K this, F#@K that as he could pack into the act and I think that it ruined what could have been a funnier performance.

1179360,A81P47EIXM8HA,B001D5F2LS,"Richardson ""Clarence""","[4, 4]","Like George's last DVD (HBO Special) Life is Worth Losing, It's Bad For Ya will scare and offend many. For those wanting the hippy dippy weatherman or A Place for my Stuff or Baseball/football type of humour light, this will feel like a sledgehammer. For those of us who have grown over the years with George and appreciated his loud wake up calls ...from his dissing George Bush 1 and the gulf war on....this is more vintage Lion in Winter George. Lambasting the child worship culture,the fraudulant SELF ESTEEM movement, pointing out that unlike his father , Governor bush, hasn't truly been elected president in the traditional way, and our dead relatives aren't hoovering above us guiding us through our daily duties. There is much more to the set..and while I slightly prefer the previous Life is Worth Losing due to its in your face wake up approach..there is much to enjoy here and take note of ....George claims that we are soft and easily placated with cellphones that make us pancakes and rub our balls! ...and he's right. Oh...and he suggestes if you really believe you have RIGHTS? Google Japanese Americans 1942 and find out about your precious RIGHTS!RIP George Carlin...he never took the easy way...he never flinched from the truth and he always kept growing...14 of these specials over the years ....what a treasure!!!BONUS FEATURES:  ..the bonus 7 minute performance (in color) from the Jackie Gleason show in 1969 is a riot!!! very cool to see George in a suit/tie short hair...doing a normal non-confrontational stand up...and..the 32 minute bonus ""Too Hip For The Room""...which I believe was pulled from a 3 hour tribute to George...is a WONDERFUL bonus feature...I wish they would have all 3 hours but this 32 minutes is sensational...the value of this package just went up up up...enjoy",5,George's swan song.....no let  up in  sight!,1228003200,"11 30, 2008",2008,1808,"['George', 'last', 'DVD', 'HBO', 'Special', 'Life', 'Worth', 'Losing', 'Bad', 'Ya', 'will', 'scare', 'offend', 'many', 'wanting', 'hippy', 'dippy', 'weatherman', 'Place', 'Stuff', 'Baseball/football', 'type', 'humour', 'light', 'will', 'feel', 'sledgehammer', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'years', 'George', 'appreciated', 'loud', 'wake', 'up', 'calls', 'dissing', 'George', 'Bush', '1', 'gulf', 'war', '.this', 'more', 'vintage', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'George', 'Lambasting', 'child', 'worship', 'culture', 'fraudulant', 'SELF', 'ESTEEM', 'movement', 'pointing', 'out', 'father', 'Governor', 'bush', ""n't"", 'truly', 'been', 'elected', 'president', 'traditional', 'way', 'dead', 'relatives', 'are', ""n't"", 'hoovering', 'guiding', 'daily', 'duties', 'much', 'more', 'set..and', 'slightly', 'prefer', 'previous', 'Life', 'Worth', 'Losing', 'due', 'face', 'wake', 'up', 'approach..there', 'much', 'enjoy', 'here', 'take', 'note', '.George', 'claims', 'are', 'soft', 'easily', 'placated', 'cellphones', 'make', 'pancakes', 'rub', 'balls', 'right', 'Oh', 'really', 'believe', 'have', 'RIGHTS', 'Google', 'Japanese', 'Americans', '1942', 'find', 'out', 'precious', 'RIGHTS', 'RIP', 'George', 'Carlin', 'never', 'took', 'easy', 'way', 'never', 'flinched', 'truth', 'always', 'kept', 'growing', '14', 'specials', 'years', 'treasure', 'BONUS', 'FEATURES', '..the', 'bonus', '7', 'minute', 'performance', 'color', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'show', '1969', 'riot', 'very', 'cool', 'see', 'George', 'suit/tie', 'short', 'hair', 'doing', 'normal', 'non-confrontational', 'stand', 'up', 'and..the', '32', 'minute', 'bonus', 'Too', 'Hip', 'Room', 'believe', 'was', 'pulled', '3', 'hour', 'tribute', 'George', 'WONDERFUL', 'bonus', 'feature', 'wish', 'would', 'have', '3', 'hours', '32', 'minutes', 'sensational', 'value', 'package', 'just', 'went', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'enjoy']",N/A
1179361,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B001D5F2LS,Spider Monkey,"[0, 0]","`It's Bad For Ya' is George Carlin's last recorded comedy concert before his death and from the word go you get his usual uncompromising, irreverent brand of humour. Walking around his living room set he shares with us his thoughts on a variety of topics and although he comes across as angry and cynical, he was also very intelligent and pertinent. Carlin's style is very reminiscent of Bill Hicks, and he even uses some of the same phrases at times, and if you like one it is a good bet you will enjoy the other. This concert covers topics like old age, death, religion, child worship/Overprotected children, stupid boring people, docile public, patriotism, civic customs and rights. Pretty much what we have come to expect from Carlin over the years. There is strong language throughout and you need to not be easily offended to enjoy his style of comedy, but to be honest most comedians are more offensive and abusive these days than Carlin ever was; it's just the more conservative elements in society don't like him opening peoples eyes to the hypocrisy and lies of those in authority. That is the message this DVD leaves you with, to always question everything, and that is a great bit of advice whatever your thoughts on life. A funny show and well worth watching.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",4,It's Bad For Ya,1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,1341,"['Bad', 'Ya', 'George', 'Carlin', 'last', 'recorded', 'comedy', 'concert', 'death', 'word', 'go', 'get', 'usual', 'uncompromising', 'irreverent', 'brand', 'humour', 'Walking', 'living', 'room', 'set', 'shares', 'thoughts', 'variety', 'topics', 'angry', 'cynical', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'intelligent', 'pertinent', 'Carlin', 'style', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Bill', 'Hicks', 'even', 'same', 'phrases', 'times', 'like', 'one', 'good', 'bet', 'will', 'enjoy', 'other', 'concert', 'topics', 'old', 'age', 'death', 'religion', 'child', 'worship/Overprotected', 'children', 'stupid', 'boring', 'people', 'docile', 'public', 'patriotism', 'civic', 'customs', 'rights', 'Pretty', 'much', 'what', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'Carlin', 'years', 'strong', 'language', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'easily', 'offended', 'enjoy', 'style', 'comedy', 'be', 'honest', 'most', 'comedians', 'are', 'more', 'offensive', 'abusive', 'days', 'Carlin', 'ever', 'was', 'just', 'more', 'conservative', 'elements', 'society', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'opening', 'peoples', 'eyes', 'hypocrisy', 'lies', 'authority', 'message', 'DVD', 'always', 'question', 'everything', 'great', 'bit', 'advice', 'thoughts', 'life', 'funny', 'show', 'well', 'worth', 'watching.Feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'blog', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'profile', 'page']",N/A
