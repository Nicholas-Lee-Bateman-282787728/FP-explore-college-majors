745579,A1OGDV7VHZB178,B00008NJFT,"John P. Pripusich ""Jack P.""","[0, 0]","Billy Crystal is a comic genious,and ""Analyze This"" is hysterically funny! This is a 2-sided (Non-Blu-Ray) DVD (""Analyze This"" (side one) and ""Analyze That"" (side two)).I mention here that, as of this date (9-30-11), I have only watched ""Analyze This"". So that's the side of the DVD I'll review here.The sound and picture quality are first-rate. I watched it on a Sony Blu-Ray player and Sony 40"" flatscreen TV (with 1080p capability). I also mention that the seller provided first quality service and the DVD arrived quickly in perfect condition. Good extras...especially the easy to navigate menu (with sound)featuring the trailer and scene selection (You'll want to replay the big ""meeting"" scene near the end of the movie multiple times! It's that funny!).Now,about the film ""Analyze This"", just in case you have not seen it. DeNiro and Crystal are absolutely magnificent together, Crystal as a psychiatrist who,through a quirk of fate, inherits mob-boss DeNiro as his patient. Hilarious stuff! No wonder there HAD to be a sequel. And let's not forget the rest of the ensemble--everyone is first-rate,including Lisa Kudrow,as Crystal's fiancee...so quirky and realistically annoying that one hopes the on-screen marriage never occurs!(For Billy's own good!).Oustanding script and direction...the movie flies by and you'll wish it was longer! I need to say that the big ""meeting scene"" near the end of the film is laugh out loud funny,replay it multiple times funny, and even laugh the next day funny! Billy Crystal is THE BEST...Wait until you hear his spiel at the mob meeting...you'll be in tears of laughter!I purchased this DVD on the strength of having seen it on broadcast TV,and enjoying it so much. I do need to mention that I had to deduct 1 star because the ""R"" rating is well-earned here. Unfiltered by network TV, be ready for: A few sexual situations and some moderate violence, but the language is really coarse. Lots of F-bombs, etc.. If I could have the ability to filter that out (""Analyze THAT""???)...or at least tone it down some, I'd do it. Having said that, one might argue that the language was necessary to add the realism of the subject matter and the ""streets"". Perhaps...but this mars an otherwise 7-star effort.There are no perfect movies out there...no perfect roses. HOWEVER, if one is able to look beyond the rugged language, which I would call the ""thorns"" of ""Analyze This"", one finds a BOUQUET of ROSES...a masterpiece of comedy. In this day and age, I think we all need a good laugh. And ""Analyze This"" delivers a huge helping of belly laughs! On a final note, I don't want to spoil the surprise, but amongst the wonderful music soundtrack of ""Analyze This"", look for a surprise and cool cameo by the great Tony Bennett. You'll love that extra treat!I look forward to viewing side 2 of this DVD soon.
