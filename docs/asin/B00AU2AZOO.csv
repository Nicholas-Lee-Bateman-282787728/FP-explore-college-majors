Britt has a striking resemblance to and the feel of Renee Zellweger in this film and Dylan looks like my high school love.  Fortunately in this movie, the guy isn't a complete jerk.

1616832,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00AU2AZOO,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 6]","""You dig me!""The memorable words from filmmaker/writer/actor Jonathan Kasdan's (""Californication"", ""Dawson's Creek"") teenage romantic comedy ""The First Time"".Starring young talents Dylan O'Brien (""Teen Wolf"", ""High Road""), Britt Robertson (""Dan in Real Life"", ""Scream 4&#8243;), Victoria Justice (""Victorious"", ""Zoey 101&#8243;), Craig Roberts (""Submarine"", ""Jayne Eyre"") and Lamarcus Tinker (""Glee"", ""Friday Night Lights"", ""Cougar Town""), ""The First Time"" would be nominated for The Grand Jury Prize at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival.VIDEO, AUDIO AND SUBTITLES:""The First Time"" is presented in 1:85:1 anamorphic widescreen and English 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Picture quality for the film is very good.  Lighting is well-done and for the most part, the film looks very good on DVD.  Audio is good with dialogue and music being crystal clear.  I detected no major problems video or audio-wise but I do wish this film was released on Blu-ray.Subtitles are in English, English SDH and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The First time"" comes with no special features.JUDGMENT CALL:I have watched a lot of teenage romantic comedies in my lifetime and within the last decade, there have only been a handful that I can say were very good.Having watched ""The First Time"", this is probably one of the best teenage romantic comedies I have seen in the last decade!Sure, a lot of teenage romantic comedies these days tend to have a music element tied to it.  From the ""Step Up"" films, the ""High School Musical"" or many Disney features to the often banal, wealthy girl and guy from the other side of the tracks storyline.But ""The First Time"" works because of its two talents, Britt Robertson and Dylan O'Brien.  For anyone who grew up and attended high school and has experienced the feeling of liking someone but knowing you don't really have a chance or even having this connection with someone but yet they are dating someone else.  These feelings and emotions are what presents itself in this teenage comedy.But its efficacy is due to the nature of the characters.  Aubrey is your mature teenager who does not like to be your average teen on Facebook or Twitter, showing public affection in public.  She watches foreign films, she listens to classics on vinyl, she wants to travel.And you have Dave, the teenager who represents a lot of shy guys with no dating experience.  Sure, the guy may have the hot female friend but he is more of the ""brother-like"" figure that listens to the girl's problems and never looked at as a guy they want to date.Many guys have been in the position of Dave and the feeling when the girl you like dates a guy that prefers the bad boys over the good guys.There is wonderful chemistry between both Dylan O'Brien and Britt Robertson and their role as awkward teenagers not knowing much about love, you can't help but root for them and hope everything works out.And while we see the awkwardness and growing connection between both characters, it's the depiction of what happens when they have sex for the very first time and I don't want to ruin the film, but these are clearly experiences that some people have experienced.This is probably one of the most captivating, witty and yet charming teenage rom com film that I have seen in a very long time.  These are experiences that teens and even adults can connect with because they are real emotions and fears that many people have experienced.  Finding someone they connect with as a teenager and that first time experience, how it's presented in the film is wonderful and ""The First Time"" distinguishes itself from other teen romantic comedies because it's not too banal.I really wished this film was released on Blu-ray but on DVD, the film looks and sounds good but where are the special features?  No commentary, no featurettes, nothing.  For a film that I enjoyed so much, I was a bit disappointed that the DVD didn't have any special features.Back in the '80s, teen films such as ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""Pretty in Pink"" won over audiences because people can connect with those films and the feeling of awkwardness but most importantly, a storyline that was entertaining, characters that people can identify with and a film that feels real.Many teenage comedies have deviated from that and have become films that want to connect with people through music or choreography or issues that affect people today as teenage pregnancy, sickness or the usual status tends to come into play much more these days in teen romance films.Overall, Jonathan Kasdan's ""The First Time"" is a teenage romantic comedy that is about its characters with a story that people can identify and be entertained by it.  It's a wonderful film and probably the best teenage romantic comedy I have seen in quite some time.  While the DVD is a barebone release, I still recommend this film as it is a must-see, for those who enjoy teenage romantic comedies!",4,A fantastic teenage romantic comedy but a barebones

I'll give you my opinion on the pros and cons of this movie to explain my three star rating.PROS:-Entertaining-Adorable and likeable leads (esp. the guy, who was one of the good guys out there)-Awkward but cute couple with good chemistry-Fun to watch the sweet, romantic beginnings of young loveCONS:-The plot was weak-There was no great msg that I got from this movie. Infact, teens may walk away with a negative message. ""There's nothing wrong with having sex in h.s. AND if it sucks the first time, keep having it because it will get better!""-Some of the supporting characters were so awkward or underdeveloped that you didn't always get them. I kept finding myself thinking, why are you even on screen right now? Either their personalities were not defined, or their relationship with the leads were foggy, or their attempt at comedy was just that, an attempt (Character ex. the main girl's first beau, the girl's parents, and the male leads two best friends). These awkard/underdeveloped characters lead to boring, awkward, and poorly written script lines. My point is, I only enjoyed the scenes with solely the two leads.-Ugh! And is this how teens are now? I worry for the day my children are teenagers! Holy cow... So much crude, skanky, vulgar material in this film. Not to mention the unintelligent dialogue from the supposedly 'smart' characters. I blame the writers. Hmm... And society as it declines. lol.Cons aside, it was a simple cute story that was enjoyable enough, but not worth the money. Since I was the only low review I felt it my responsibility to warn others out there, who too, will not share a five star love of this movie. That is a rating I don't just give to anything, it has to deserve it. This movie? It deserved three stars.Parental advisery warning: Constant swearing throughout in casual conversation, including one use of the F word.

1616854,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B00AU2AZOO,Sean Pasek,"[43, 45]","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***Teen romantic comedies seem to be a dime a dozen.  It doesn't seem like too many fresh stories come along anymore that aren't filled with the typical clich&eacute;s.  But, sometimes when you are least expecting it, and you are resisting giving another teen comedy a chance, one surprises you.The First Time is a little gem of a film that is intelligently written and directed by Jon Kasdan.  He provides us with an intriguing story with smart, every-day characters that we like.  The story is about two teens who arbitrarily meet at teen drunk-fest.  However, rather than being inside with all of the other kids, Dave (Dylan O'Brien) is outside in an alley practicing how he is going to share his longtime feelings with his friend Jane, who is basically worshiped by boys everywhere.  Through the door comes Aubrey (Britt Robertson) who obviously isn't into the party scene but was dragged there by her friends.  Suddenly, these two kids strike up a conversation.  The wonderful, and frankly, best part about this movie are the conversations that are shared between Dave and Aubrey throughout the film.  They discover that they have something in common, despite Dave's infatuation for Jane, and despite Aubrey's ""boyfriend.""Aubrey is a girl with many ideas about life.  But, like a teenager, it's all theory and no experience.  This is not a slight against the character, but a realistic one, which is why the movie works so well.  She is an intelligent girl who isn't thrown into ideas of wild fancy.  She slights ""cheesy romance"" even though on some level, she likes it.  She hates PDA for the same reason.  She is inexperienced in the areas of romance and relationships, which obviously includes sex.  However, she has a certain wit and charm that makes her very likeable.  She is more guarded with her emotions than Dave.  It's a scary thing to let go of those walls long enough to let someone in; to risk getting hurt.Dave is your ""good guy.""  However, he doesn't fit the typical mold of the ""nice guy"" by being some kind of a loser.  He's a cool guy too.  He is caring, and it becomes quickly obvious that he is falling for Aubrey.  He knows he has more in common with Aubrey than he ever would with Jane.  However, like Aubrey, Dave is also inexperienced.  Dave is a bit shy, but he opens up around Aubrey.I like the fact that the friends of the main characters aren't clich&eacute;d either.  We expect Jane to be one of those typical stuck-up girls.  She knows she's attractive, but she also wonders why she can't seem to attract ""a real man"" as she confesses to Aubrey.  Jane isn't wise enough to realize that her best ""guy"" friend fits the mold to a T, and Aubrey nearly tells her this when she quickly bites her tongue.  Ronnie, however, is more in line with the typical unfeeling, uncaring boyfriend who is only interested in one thing.  He just doesn't get it.The interesting thing about being a teenager is that they idolize and idealize a number of ""first time"" experiences.  Show me a teenager who doesn't dream and fantasize about things like the first kiss, the first time you make love, etc.  And, of course, when things don't pan out to their expectations, it's as if the world has conspired against them.  They quickly believe they have done something wrong, rather than understanding that it's really nothing more than a lack of knowledge and experience.  In other words, teenagers are great talkers about experiences, especially ones they have never had.  Life is often a journey of trial and error, and it is unfortunate that our kids often have to learn the hard way rather than have an understanding parent to enlighten them.  Of course, it would help if these teens would talk to their parents, but we understand the fears surrounding that.After less than two days' time, Aubrey invites Dave over to her house when her parents are going out.  We all know what is going to happen.  However, the viewer may be surprised by what actually does happen.  Dave shows up.  The two get to the point where they are talking so much while they  are kissing, that it's painfully obvious, that they are about to hit that wall; the wall to which on the other side, lies the unknown.  There is an awkwardness that hits them both like a mack truck.  And why wouldn't it?  They are both aiming for perfection of experience and expression.  And yet, neither one knows how to go about it.  This is what parents mean when they ask their teenagers to ""wait until you are ready and you have the maturity to deal with what follows.""  The physical aspects are simple compared to the emotional aspects.  This is the area that befuddles teens and adults alike.  A bond is created, and inevitably what follows is uncomfortable silence and awkwardness.  Dave and Aubrey are trying to figure out what went wrong.  Why didn't things work like they expected them to?Teens can often look at experiences as an ""all or nothing"" proposition.  So, if something as big as a first time of love-making doesn't work out, is that then the end of the relationship?  Dave and Aubrey try to figure out who did what wrong.  Who is to blame?  Wisdom is passed on by Dave's quiet friend, who tells him, ""it was sex.  One time.  The first time.  You don't know anything from that.  You're going to tell me that it isn't worth giving one more shot?  But you need to be a man.""  In other words, don't give up and throw in the towel like many teens (and even adults!) would do.  Instead, talk to her and figure it out.  It can be worked out.The movie works because of the two characters.  Britt Robertson all but steals this movie with her portrayal of the perky, quick-witted, but emotionally scared Aubrey.  She has a charm and a certain vivaciousness that makes Aubrey stand out and apart from so many other teen-girl characters.  Dylan O'Brien pretty much keeps pace with Britt.  He matches her in every scene, and both actors do a phenomenal job of expressing their characters' naivety and vulnerabilities.There are some peripheral characters that we just don't see enough of, and unfortunately, it detracts a bit from the film.  Dave's sister is cute as a button, but she is only in two scenes.  Aubrey's parents are the only parents that we see, and unless they were planning to explore both of these relationships a bit more, they don't really add much to the film.I think this movie should be required viewing for older teens.  I think they could all relate to the two main characters in many ways and see some parallels between them and their own lives.  In the end, it is about communication.  And we can all do a better job at that.",4,Touching and Realistic Exploration of First Time Love and Sex,1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,6642,"['***POSSIBLE', 'SPOILERS***Teen', 'romantic', 'comedies',
