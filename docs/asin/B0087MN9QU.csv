1548104,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0087MN9QU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 11]","After winning a Screenplay Oscar for ""Milk,"" Dustin Lance Black probably had a fair amount of freedom and leverage to pursue a project that meant something personal to him.  The intimate and quirky ""Virginia"" is undoubtedly the result of that liberation (and I'm sure it didn't hurt that Milk's director Gus Van Sant got an Executive Producer credit as well).  Taking the directorial reigns and writing the screenplay for ""Virginia,"" Black proves that he has no shortage of ideas.  While that definitely makes ""Virginia"" feel different, it also makes it seem overstuffed and slightly schizophrenic.  The story veers from comedy and satire to tragedy and melodrama and never feels particularly cohesive.  Furthermore, so many plot threads (and even characters) are introduced only to languish as undefined, underutilized, or completely irrelevant.  Don't get me wrong, I think there's an interesting story at the heart of ""Virginia.""  I just thought the movie lacked sufficient follow-through for the many disparate elements that it tried to incorporate.  This sense of chaos and lack of focus kept me distanced from the drama and I never fully connected at an emotional level to the action.A very blonde Jennifer Connelly plays the titular Virginia, a mother suffering from some form of mental illness.  I am never completely comfortable with using mental illness as a plot point, but here is seemed especially specious as its impact only seems to surface (and then fluctuate) as the plot needs it to at any given point.  Sometimes, the illness is even played for laughs.  Connelly is wrapped up in an illicit affair with the Mormon sheriff and Senatorial candidate Ed Harris.  The long-running affair seems a bit indiscreet and Harris' sexual proclivities are played for amusement, once again, as opposed to establishing something real.  The actual meat of the tale, however, is provided by Connelly's illegitimate son (Harrison Gilbertson).  More than anything, ""Virginia"" is a countrified coming-of-age saga which gives this talented young actor the chance to shine.  Pieced together by an alternating narration (so you can keep track as the movie jumps around), the movie has a dash of everything from young love, to petty crime, to mortal illness, to shoot-outs, to political chicanery.  The actors do their best, it's simply too much to take seriously.One easy reason to recommend ""Virginia,"" though, despite my misgivings is for the performances.  Connelly is surprisingly grounded when asked to do the silliest things.  She almost sells even the most ridiculous scenarios.  Harris, as expected, does solid character work as does his real life and movie wife Amy Madigan (a great actress often underused).  Emma Roberts and Toby Jones lend nice support.  But for me, the true discovery here is Harrison Gilbertson.  This appealing young actor has the movie's largest role and is really really good.  I expect to see him move on to a promising career.  But despite this talented cast, the screenplay lets everyone down a bit.  Black is a great writer, he just needs to edit his choices.  As the movie moves into a tragic conclusion, I wanted to feel emotionally invested but it just didn't happen.  The potential is there, the movie just tried to do too many things and ended up watering down the elements that might have worked so well.  Interesting, but not fully cooked.  If you like the actors, you might give it a try but a bit of a disappointment for me.

1548105,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0087MN9QU,Lee Armstrong,"[1, 1]","Dustin Lance Black won the Oscar for the screenplay to ""Milk"" and also penned the screenplay for the Clint Eastwood-directed ""J Edgar.""  ""Virginia"" obviously represents a labor of love for him, directing and writing.  It is a film difficult to niche, which will make it difficult for audiences trained to categorize films as ""comedy,"" ""romance"" or ""drama.""  There are no super heroes here, albeit there is a bit of a ghostly aspect to the film.  For me, this film worked completely!I particularly love its ending.  Jennifer Connelly plays the main character Virginia.  Her husband walked out on the family and leaves her depressed with a possible mental condition.  Virginia does things in an offbeat and original way.  Her understanding of issues like religion and social propriety are limited.  At the end of the film, we find her love for her son Emmett, well played by Harrison Gilbertson, to be perfect.  She is willing to sacrifice herself completely for him.  It's an act of love, imperfect but Christ-like in its sacrifice.  As an actress, Jennifer Connelly takes these hairpin twists and turns of character like a race car driver scrambling up a mountain road.The scenes with Mormon missionaries who come sometime after the Baptists are so pathetic.  Virginia understands so little of the religions, willing to try them on like new clothes as long as they promise salvation in the afterlife.  At the end, when Virginia has to literally take the missionary's clothes to disguise Emmett so he can get away, the film bounces to the comic before its big bang ending.Ed Harris does a great job as small-town politician Richard Tipton who likewise tries to keep up appearances as a loving family man with traditional values, while waiting to break away and have Virginia handcuff him to her bed.  The hypocrisy is the stuff of which political headlines are all too frequently made.I loved the DVD extras where producer/actress Yeardley Smith comments on the film.  In ""Virginia,"" she plays social worker Mrs. Whitaker who gets more than a cold shoulder from Virginia.  Known as the voice of Lisa on ""The Simpsons,"" she talks about how she probably wouldn't have been considered for the role if she hadn't also served as a producer.""Virginia"" is not going to be every audience's cup of tea.  But it deals with characters that feel real, imperfect people.  Some of them try to do their best, some of them try to look like they're doing their best, and some of them wouldn't know ""best"" if it bit them.  It's a great quirky film, well worth watching for the adventurous viewer.

1548109,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B0087MN9QU,Sheryl Fechter,"[2, 2]","Director Dustin Lance Blank writes this film in the same fashion as the diagnosis given to Virginia (Jennifer Connelly); Traumatic Onset Schizophrenia.  Her Social Worker, Mrs. Whitaker (Yeardley Smith of ""The Simpsons""), divulges this information only one time while watching. In the beginning of the movie we are introduced, in hindsight, to a tragedy. This situation then goes onward to set the whole tone of the picture; which bounces to and fro with a quirk of characters.  The entire story can be indecisive and schizoid ... At times.An abusive standpoint is introduced, from the position of an authoritative figure, towards a vulnerable and emotionally disturbed single mother. Ed Harris contributes an uncaring man, and a monster of his own circumstances, which, in turn, marks Connelly's (in my opinion) spot-on performance. Blank directs without any real cohesiveness in the background while defining the character  portrayals tightly in the forefront.  A standout for me was Harrison Gilbertson portraying Virginia's son, Emmett. Most of the recounting comes from his point of view, in this off-kilter, coming of age tale set through his life's situation.The local Sheriff, Richard Tipton (Ed Harris), is married to Rosanna (Amy Madigan) and they have a daughter, Jessie (Emma Roberts), together.  He also is running a campaign for State Legislator and is heavily involved in the Mormon Church, just as heavily as he has been involved with Virginia.Young Emmett inevitably falls in love with Jessie.  This is disgusting to Richard, who then becomes hell-bent on splitting them up and uses extreme measures for his own purposes.  Emmett is highly protective of Virginia while she remains heavily reliant on him and emotes that, ""he's the best thing I ever did"".  Virginia turns to Emmett's reasoning, or goes to her own heart, when faced with weighty decisions. Her addled sensibilities cannot make-up her mind all too often.""How the hell should I know what I should, or shouldn't believe, from my own mom"".  A frustrated Emmett really never knows just what to expect. Just as soon as Virginia makes a decision, she changes it and acts out the opposite publicly. At times these illusive decisions will bring out a well-healed comedic side, without the obviousness to make her predictable.Virginia's indecision of which religion is best is like juggling balls in the air. The strong Mormon theme touches her life, in many ways, in her childlike innocence. Ideas born from confusion cloud her judgment throughout, while drawing up to the conclusion. Virginia is actually getting more physically ill and that's unbeknownst to Emmett.It's at this point, to pull the story altogether, that the intensity swells and Virginia finds herself and Emmett in jeopardy. I could start feeling the characters more as Virginia masterfully switches things up, making a huge sacrifice of herself, to put her son first. It's in this moment we know that her heart has always been in the right place, if not her mindset ... Unwavering, going along with Emmett, in a dark bang-up twist ending.",4,"""Jessie, Do You Think God Always Listens to Your Daddy's Prayers?"" - Emmett",1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,3081,"['Director', 'Dustin', 'Lance', 'Blank', 'film', 'same', 'fashion', 'diagnosis', 'given', 'Virginia', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Traumatic', 'Onset', 'Schizophrenia', 'Social', 'Worker', 'Mrs.', 'Whitaker', 'Yeardley', 'Smith', 'Simpsons', 'information', 'only', 'one', 'time', 'watching', 'beginning', 'movie', 'are', 'introduced', 'hindsight', 'tragedy', 'situation', 'then', 'onward', 'set', 'whole', 'tone', 'picture', 'fro', 'quirk', 'characters', 'entire', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'indecisive', 'schizoid', 'times.An', 'abusive', 'standpoint', 'introduced', 'position', 'authoritative', 'figure', 'vulnerable', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'single', 'mother', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'uncaring', 'man', 'monster', 'own', 'circumstances', 'turn', 'Connelly', 'opinion', 'spot-on', 'performance', 'Blank', 'real', 'cohesiveness', 'background', 'defining', 'character', 'portrayals', 'tightly', 'forefront', 'standout', 'was', 'Harrison', 'Gilbertson', 'portraying', 'Virginia', 'son', 'Emmett', 'Most', 'recounting', 'point', 'view', 'off-kilter', 'coming', 'age', 'tale', 'set', 'life', 'situation.The', 'local', 'Sheriff', 'Richard', 'Tipton', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'married', 'Rosanna', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'have', 'daughter', 'Jessie', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'together', 'also', 'running', 'campaign', 'State', 'Legislator', 'heavily', 'involved', 'Mormon', 'Church', 'just', 'as', 'heavily', 'been', 'involved', 'Virginia.Young', 'Emmett', 'inevitably', 'love', 'Jessie', 'disgusting', 'Richard', 'who', 'then', 'hell-bent', 'splitting', 'up', 'extreme', 'measures', 'own', 'purposes', 'Emmett', 'highly', 'protective', 'Virginia', 'heavily', 'reliant', 'best', 'thing', 'ever', 'did', 'Virginia', 'Emmett', 'reasoning', 'own', 'heart', 'when', 'faced', 'weighty', 'decisions', 'addled', 'sensibilities', 'can', 'not', 'make-up', 'mind', 'too', 'often', 'How', 'hell', 'should', 'know', 'what', 'should', 'should', ""n't"", 'believe', 'own', 'mom', 'frustrated', 'Emmett', 'really', 'never', 'just', 'what', 'expect', 'Just', 'as', 'soon', 'Virginia', 'decision', 'out', 'opposite', 'publicly', 'times', 'illusive', 'decisions', 'will', 'bring', 'out', 'well-healed', 'comedic', 'side', 'obviousness', 'make', 'predictable.Virginia', 'indecision', 'religion', 'best', 'juggling', 'balls', 'air', 'strong', 'Mormon', 'theme', 'life', 'many', 'ways', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'Ideas', 'born', 'confusion', 'cloud', 'judgment', 'drawing', 'up', 'conclusion', 'Virginia', 'actually', 'getting', 'more', 'physically', 'ill', 'unbeknownst', 'Emmett.It', 'point', 'pull', 'story', 'altogether', 'intensity', 'swells', 'Virginia', 'Emmett', 'jeopardy', 'could', 'start', 'feeling', 'characters', 'more', 'Virginia', 'masterfully', 'things', 'up', 'making', 'huge', 'sacrifice', 'herself', 'put', 'son', 'first', 'moment', 'know', 'heart', 'always', 'been', 'right', 'place', 'not', 'mindset', 'Unwavering', 'going', 'Emmett', 'dark', 'bang-up', 'twist', 'ending']",N/A
