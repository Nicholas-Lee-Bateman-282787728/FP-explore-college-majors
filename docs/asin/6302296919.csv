306362,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6302296919,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[6, 8]","As a big-time Jodie Foster fan, I try to watch any movie she appears in, yet I left BackTrack sitting on my shelf for basically several years before popping it in the old VCR (and, for the record, I have the 1992 Director's Cut version on VHS).  After hearing a reviewer I respect heap praise upon this film, I knew there must be something there that never came across to me on the box cover.  Actually, the film was better than I expected, yet it is not a film that distinguished itself in my eyes as anything very special.  Jodie Foster is, of course, terrific as always; Dennis Hopper does not wig out too many times; and a most interesting cast of characters come and go along the way.  The problem I have is with the characterization, which is not sufficient in my eyes to describe the transformation of Jodie Foster's character in the course of the events that play out.Foster plays Anne Benton, an up-and-coming young artist (who uses a most unusual medium for her art) who forgets all about the front tire that blows out and almost causes her to wreck her car when she accidentally witnesses a gang-land hit.  Luckily, the Mafia bad guys in this movie can never seem to hit a moving target, so Anne escapes and goes immediately to the police, unaware of the true nature of this particular homicide until two hit men break into her home in an attempt to kill her and the police start expounding upon the virtues of the federal witness protection program.  She decides to make a run for it and try to build a new life elsewhere on her own.  The police want her as a witness, and the Mafia family run by Mr. Avoca ( an aged Vincent Price) just wants her silenced.  The Mafia man for the job is Milo (Dennis Hopper), an accomplished hit man who begins tracking Anne down as she moves across the country.  By the time he finds here, though, Milo has fallen in love with her, which is something of a no-no for a man in his profession.  He and Anne do not seem to be a natural match by any stretch of the imagination, and thus their evolving relationship just never makes complete sense to me, especially from Anne's perspective, and this is my main point of contention here with the film.  Anyway, the movie-long chase has to end somewhere, and the filmmakers do succeed in pulling off a pretty satisfying conclusion.BackTrack does deserve better than the relative obscurity in which it has lain, although I would not consider this a great film by any means.  It is worth a look just for the surprising number of famous faces that grace the screen; besides Foster and Hopper you will see Charlie Sheen, Dean Stockwell (who speaks in one of the most ridiculous put-on voices I have ever heard), the aforementioned Vincent Price, Joe Pesci, and none other than Bob Dylan.  I love Bob Dylan and his music, but he really does not possess the charisma or talent necessary to be an actor.  Still, it is quite a hoot to see him pop up unexpectedly in the film in a small but quite memorable little scene.  All told, BackTrack does have a few interesting things to show the viewer above and beyond the sight of a young Jodie Foster working her magic in front of the cameras (without her clothes at one point, for those who care about that sort of thing).  I would not rush out and try to find a copy of the movie, but if it ever passes your way, it is certainly worth a couple hours' of your free time.",3,An average thriller with a superb cast,1058745600,"07 21, 2003",2003,3396,"['big-time', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'fan', 'try', 'watch', 'movie', 'yet', 'left', 'BackTrack', 'sitting', 'shelf', 'basically', 'several', 'years', 'popping', 'old', 'VCR', 'record', 'have', '1992', 'Director', 'Cut', 'version', 'VHS', 'hearing', 'reviewer', 'respect', 'heap', 'praise', 'film', 'knew', 'must', 'be', 'something', 'there', 'never', 'came', 'box', 'cover', 'Actually', 'film', 'was', 'better', 'expected', 'not', 'film', 'distinguished', 'eyes', 'anything', 'very', 'special', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'course', 'terrific', 'always', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'not', 'wig', 'out', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'most', 'interesting', 'cast', 'characters', 'come', 'go', 'way', 'problem', 'have', 'characterization', 'not', 'sufficient', 'eyes', 'describe', 'transformation', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'character', 'course', 'events', 'play', 'out.Foster', 'plays', 'Anne', 'Benton', 'up-and-coming', 'young', 'artist', 'who', 'most', 'unusual', 'medium', 'art', 'who', 'front', 'tire', 'out', 'almost', 'wreck', 'car', 'when', 'accidentally', 'gang-land', 'hit', 'Luckily', 'Mafia', 'bad', 'guys', 'movie', 'can', 'never', 'seem', 'hit', 'moving', 'target', 'so', 'Anne', 'escapes', 'immediately', 'police', 'unaware', 'true', 'nature', 'particular', 'homicide', 'two', 'hit', 'men', 'break', 'home', 'attempt', 'kill', 'police', 'start', 'expounding', 'virtues', 'federal', 'witness', 'protection', 'program', 'make', 'run', 'try', 'build', 'new', 'life', 'elsewhere', 'own', 'police', 'want', 'witness', 'Mafia', 'family', 'run', 'Mr.', 'Avoca', 'aged', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'just', 'silenced', 'Mafia', 'man', 'job', 'Milo', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'accomplished', 'hit', 'man', 'who', 'tracking', 'Anne', 'down', 'country', 'time', 'here', 'though', 'Milo', 'fallen', 'love', 'something', 'no-no', 'man', 'profession', 'Anne', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'natural', 'match', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'thus', 'evolving', 'relationship', 'just', 'never', 'complete', 'sense', 'especially', 'Anne', 'perspective', 'main', 'point', 'contention', 'here', 'film', 'Anyway', 'movie-long', 'chase', 'end', 'somewhere', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'succeed', 'pulling', 'off', 'pretty', 'satisfying', 'conclusion.BackTrack', 'deserve', 'better', 'relative', 'obscurity', 'lain', 'would', 'not', 'consider', 'great', 'film', 'means', 'look', 'just', 'surprising', 'number', 'famous', 'grace', 'screen', 'Foster', 'Hopper', 'will', 'see', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'who', 'one', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'put-on', 'voices', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'aforementioned', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'none', 'other', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'love', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'music', 'really', 'not', 'possess', 'charisma', 'talent', 'necessary', 'be', 'actor', 'Still', 'quite', 'hoot', 'see', 'pop', 'up', 'unexpectedly', 'film', 'small', 'quite', 'memorable', 'little', 'scene', 'told', 'BackTrack', 'have', 'few', 'interesting', 'things', 'show', 'viewer', 'sight', 'young', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'working', 'magic', 'front', 'cameras', 'clothes', 'one', 'point', 'who', 'care', 'sort', 'thing', 'would', 'not', 'rush', 'out', 'try', 'find', 'copy', 'movie', 'ever', 'way', 'certainly', 'worth', 'couple', 'hours', 'free', 'time']",Backtrack VHS

306365,A3HB5BTD9VHDS8,6302296919,"""jbridell""","[10, 13]","This film has gotten much bad press.  For example an offish interviewer in US magazine in 1994 asked Jodie &quot;can you tell us how Backtrack&quot; (the 1990 bomb) happened&quot; as if the film were some sort of dark secret  Ms. Foster should be ashamed of.  Nonsense.  This was a good film with a  great cast and an interesting plot.  A hard-boiled hitman (Hopper) is sent  to track down and kill a reluctant mob witness (Foster) after finding her  he falls in love and can't kill her but can't really love her either.  The  films greatest line  Hopper:  &quot;I gave up my career for you&quot;.  The  cinematography and lush location filming make it a treat to watch.  Jodie  has never looked better, especially in a wonderful scene where she rescues  a lamb, a noisy lamb, and cradles it in her arms against an Arizona  sunrise, beautiful.  There are two things however that make this film not  so good.  One is a contrived, TV cop show, style ending, the other is the  criminally stupid scene in which Hopper points a gun at Jodie and forces  her to strip and come to bed with him.  It is the most agonizing scene ever  filmed.  Ever.  Hopper should have talked to any of Ms. Fosters fans who  would have told him that she simply does not take her clothes off on film.  Ever.  He should have known that.  Nonetheless, the scenes of her LED box  art projects, which sell for $20,000 and up,  have messages like  &quot;Murder has it's sexual side&quot; are fascinating.  The film is worth  owning and watching, it is well crafted if misguided.  Sadly I have never  heard of Dennis Hopper ever directing a big budget film ever again.

One thing you totally believe is that he is obsessed with her from the first time he sees her and is helpless to do anything other than what he does. She is a study in what often happens to a victim. She becomes attached to her captor because her fear of what could happen to her is so much stronger than her fear of him. After all, she can handle him and he will protect her.

Its only redeeming factor is that Jodie Foster shows an eye-popping amount of flesh - and it's no body double. And what a great set of legs! That's why I'm awarding two stars, one for each gam, which just goes to show the sophistication level of the film (AND my review of it).Anne Benton (Foster) is a &quot;conceptual artist&quot;, which means, in the wacky Southern California milieu in which she has her gallery, she creates pieces using message board displays.  You know, those where one line of illuminated text moves right to left across a long and narrow screen. Anyway, one night after experiencing a flat tire on the freeway, she witnesses a mob hit on the premises of an oil refinery. (For those LA viewers, it's the one just off the 405 south of LAX where the freeway curves to the east above Palos Verdes.) Like a good citizen, she goes to the police, who realize that they have in Benton a valuable witness against organized crime, and specifically against Big Boss Mr. Avoca (Vincent Price). But after her apartment is invaded and her boyfriend (a quickly expendable Charlie Sheen) shot to death, Anne realizes neither the cops nor the Feds can protect her, so she flees town and establishes a new identity and career. To hunt her down, mob goodfella Leo Carelli (Joe Pesci) hires the saxophone-playing assassin Milo (Dennis Hopper), who tracks her across the West using computer databases. The thing is, he begins to obsess about Anne after finding photos of her (un)dressed in dominatrix accessories. Milo has issues.The plot has a Keystone Cops quality as law enforcement seeks to retrieve Benton by following Milo. And after the latter severs communication with his employers in favor of his own agenda of infatuation, Leo's thugs go after Milo and Anne by following the cops. Even then, the storyline might've been redeemable if it hadn't taken such a Bonnie and Clyde twist, and the conclusion (at that same refinery) is positively ludicrous.Hopper as Milo is almost the caricature of a mob hit man. Where did he get those clothes, that hat, and that accent? And speaking of accents, Leo's lawyer John Luponi (Dean Stockwell) has to be one of the most over-acted roles in recent memory.

306370,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6302296919,Linda Linguvic,"[5, 10]","I expected to like this quirky 1990s film.  It's directed by Dennis Hopper and has a list of great actors and an intriguing theme.  A woman artist witnesses a Mafia murder and goes to the police. However, she recognizes one of the cops as one of the hit men and goes on the run.  The bad guys want her dead and even hire their own hit man who becomes obsessed with her.  That's the kind of story I like, especially as Jodie Forster is cast as the woman and Dennis Hopper is cast as the hit man.  Also in the cast are Dean Stockwell as the crocked cop, Bobby Dillon as a fellow artist, John Tuturro and Tony Sirico (Paulie on of The Sopranos fame) as mobsters, and there's even a cameo by Vincent Price.My expectations for this film didn't pay off, however.  From the very beginning, when Jodie Foster's car breaks down and she witnesses the mob hit, I found myself annoyed.  There she was, leaving her car, wearing high heels and a skimpy dress and not even carrying a purse.  Later, it was just too easy for her to change her identity.  She went to a cemetery, found a gravestone of a woman who would have been her age, and applied for a birth certificate and a social security card.  Also, the technology of the time (1990) was certainly not sophisticated enough for Dennis Hopper to go to a computer screen and track her identity change.All the characters came across as exaggerated comic strip caracatures  and I found myself laughing out loud when they tried to be serious.  Perhaps this was the director's intention, but the film just couldn't hold my attention.  I wanted to turn it off after ten minutes but hoped it would get better.  Somehow I watched for another forty minutes before ejecting the DVD disk with disgust at such a waste of talent.If you've never heard of this film I can well understand why.  It was simply a dud.  I have only one thing to say about this film.

He later made a director's cut that runs at 116 minutes instead of the approximately 98 minutes.Jodie Foster plays an artist who happens to witness a mob killing. She manages to escape but the mob fins out where she lives and kills no her but, by accident, her boyfriend (Charlie Sheen). She is offered to be taken into a witness protection program but instead goes into hiding on her own. Hopper plays the hitman that is hired to kill her. But he likes her and offers her her life in return for her company and obedience. Afer a while she starts to actually like the man. And here's the movie's main flaw. The relationship between Hopper and Foster develop from hostile to friendly much too quickly to feel realistic. I haven't seen the director's cut but maybe the character development feels more believable in that version. On the plus side, it's well acted. The cast also includes an uncredited Joe Pesci and one of the last performances of Vincent Price.
