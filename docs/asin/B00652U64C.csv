Dime novels and journalists popularized him as a bloodthirsty outlaw, and he became a character in many Hollywood movies (sometimes as Billy Antrim). Sometimes as a villain, other times as a misunderstood Robin Hood. [Robert M. Utley wrote his biography around 1980. Billy preferred dancing with young ladies rather than whiskey-drinking.] This story tells about his character and life. His mother died when he was fourteen and he got involved with bad characters. He was a wanted man at sixteen after breaking out of jail. He dealt cards and horses. He killed a man in a fight and fled to Arizona to New Mexico. The big landowners were taking over New Mexico to profit from cattle ranching. John Tunstall arrived to start his cattle business and befriended Billy and others. This economic conflict was known as the Lincoln County War.After Tunstall was killed by the Sheriff's men his cowboys vowed to take revenge and did so in an ambush. There was a shooting war with ""the House"", Tunstall's competitors. Billy could find a refuge among the small sheep ranchers (he spoke Spanish like a Mexican). This war attracted wide attention. Washington appointed General Lew Wallace (the author of ""Ben Hur"") as the Territorial Governor to settle the conflict. ""The House"" paid off the newspapers to get favorable publicity for their side. Pat Garret was appointed Sheriff to capture Billy's gang. (Billy's character made him the leader of older men.) But Billy escaped from jail after killing two jailers. He stayed in the Territory to be near his girlfriend. Pat Garrett found him and killed him. This became national news. Journalists wrote many stories about this now famous outlaw. In the 1920s a Chicago editor wrote a book portraying him as the Robin Hood of the Southwest. Many television shows used a similar character of a nice smiling young man who was also very dangerous.",4,His Life and Crimes,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,2027,"['Billy', 'Kid', 'American', 'Experience', '2012', 'filmWilliam', 'Henry', 'Bonney', 'was', 'born', 'New', 'York', 'city', '1860', 'died', 'Territory', 'New', 'Mexico', '1881', 'Dime', 'novels', 'journalists', 'popularized', 'bloodthirsty', 'outlaw', 'became', 'character', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'sometimes', 'Billy', 'Antrim', 'Sometimes', 'villain', 'other', 'times', 'misunderstood', 'Robin', 'Hood', '[', 'Robert', 'M.', 'Utley', 'wrote', 'biography', '1980', 'Billy', 'preferred', 'dancing', 'young', 'ladies', 'rather', 'whiskey-drinking', ']', 'story', 'character', 'life', 'mother', 'died', 'when', 'was', 'fourteen', 'got', 'involved', 'bad', 'characters', 'was', 'wanted', 'man', 'sixteen', 'breaking', 'jail', 'dealt', 'cards', 'horses', 'killed', 'man', 'fight', 'fled', 'Arizona', 'New', 'Mexico', 'big', 'landowners', 'were', 'taking', 'over', 'New', 'Mexico', 'profit', 'cattle', 'ranching', 'John', 'Tunstall', 'arrived', 'start', 'cattle', 'business', 'befriended', 'Billy', 'others', 'economic', 'conflict', 'was', 'known', 'Lincoln', 'County', 'War.After', 'Tunstall', 'was', 'killed', 'Sheriff', 'men', 'cowboys', 'vowed', 'take', 'revenge', 'did', 'so', 'ambush', 'was', 'shooting', 'war', 'House', 'Tunstall', 'competitors', 'Billy', 'could', 'find', 'refuge', 'small', 'sheep', 'ranchers', 'spoke', 'Spanish', 'Mexican', 'war', 'attracted', 'wide', 'attention', 'Washington', 'appointed', 'General', 'Lew', 'Wallace', 'author', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'Territorial', 'Governor', 'settle', 'conflict', 'House', 'paid', 'newspapers', 'get', 'favorable', 'publicity', 'side', 'Pat', 'Garret', 'was', 'appointed', 'Sheriff', 'capture', 'Billy', 'gang', 'Billy', 'character', 'made', 'leader', 'older', 'men', 'Billy', 'escaped', 'jail', 'killing', 'two', 'jailers', 'stayed', 'Territory', 'be', 'girlfriend', 'Pat', 'Garrett', 'found', 'killed', 'became', 'national', 'news', 'Journalists', 'wrote', 'many', 'stories', 'now', 'famous', 'outlaw', '1920s', 'Chicago', 'editor', 'wrote', 'book', 'portraying', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Southwest', 'Many', 'television', 'shows', 'used', 'similar', 'character', 'nice', 'smiling', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'dangerous']",American Experience: Billy the Kid

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[5, 6]","My fellow reviewer  - Wogan - pretty much summarized this DVD which I found to be well done, though I really don't have a interest in Western American culture. We all grw up hearing about ""Billy the Kid"" and there was a feature film about ""Pat Garrett and Billy The Kid"" (Garrett being the sheriff), but if you ask most folks about him, there is little response except that he was a ""folk hero"".The 55-minute show, narrated by Michael Murphy, uses lots of well-done recreations and inserts archival photos. After about 10 minutes you realize you are seeing the SAME photo of ""Billy"" who was born with the name Henry (without a known father) in New York, and moved west with his mother after the Civil war, changing his own name TWICE. He was arrested first at age 15 and died at age 21.. so there isn't much of a life to tell. That photo continues (sometime colorized) until we get to 1880 and find out the reason for the photo - the only one known to exist.The ""experts"" are all authors - except for one ""Historian"" - and are engaging speakers. Two have Irish brogues which add to the stories of some of the characters in Billy's ""story"" who were Irish.There are no special features for this episode of the PBS ""American Experience"" series. Certainly of interest to those who like western American culture, but others will find the time spent watching it worthwhile.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,"Well done documentary on ""outlaw"" whose ""career"" lasted only 6 years and who died at age 21",1331337600,"03 10, 2012",2012,1458,"['fellow', 'reviewer', 'Wogan', 'pretty', 'much', 'summarized', 'DVD', 'found', 'be', 'well', 'done', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'interest', 'Western', 'American', 'culture', 'grw', 'up', 'hearing', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'was', 'feature', 'film', 'Pat', 'Garrett', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'Garrett', 'being', 'sheriff', 'ask', 'most', 'folks', 'little', 'response', 'was', 'folk', 'hero', '55-minute', 'show', 'narrated', 'Michael', 'Murphy', 'lots', 'well-done', 'recreations', 'inserts', 'archival', 'photos', '10', 'minutes', 'realize', 'are', 'seeing', 'SAME', 'photo', 'Billy', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'name', 'Henry', 'known', 'father', 'New', 'York', 'moved', 'west', 'mother', 'Civil', 'war', 'changing', 'own', 'name', 'TWICE', 'was', 'arrested', 'first', 'age', '15', 'died', 'age', '21..', 'so', ""n't"", 'much', 'life', 'tell', 'photo', 'sometime', 'colorized', 'get', '1880', 'find', 'out', 'reason', 'photo', 'only', 'one', 'known', 'exist.The', 'experts', 'are', 'authors', 'one', 'Historian', 'are', 'engaging', 'speakers', 'Two', 'have', 'Irish', 'brogues', 'add', 'stories', 'characters', 'Billy', 'story', 'who', 'were', 'Irish.There', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'episode', 'PBS', 'American', 'Experience', 'series', 'Certainly', 'interest', 'who', 'like', 'western', 'American', 'culture', 'others', 'will', 'find', 'time', 'spent', 'watching', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",American Experience: Billy the Kid

It is reiterated several times that - yes he killed people and was a `cop killer'; but he is presented as a legend and it is explained why, to some people, he was almost a hero.There are well done reenactments and numerous talking heads - historians and writers who make countless observations. Period pictures, newspaper illustrations are shown; however by the end of this 60 minute piece one might have grown weary of the frequent showings of the photo that Billy the Kid had made of himself, which is also the picture on the cover of the DVD box.We are taken back to his childhood and told a bit about his mother and how his friendship developed with the Mexican community. His escape from hanging and then his death is reenacted also.What is of interest, because it is seldom explained, is how Billy developed his attitude that the law system was corrupt and why he engaged in what became known as the Lincoln County War.This DVD does have a set up for English subtitles and is of interest to those who wish to learn more of this historical time period and person.",4,Billy the legend,1329436800,"02 17, 2012",2012,1155,"['DVD', 'explain', 'motives', 'actions', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'Henry', 'McCarty', 'reiterated', 'several', 'times', 'yes', 'killed', 'people', 'was', 'cop', 'killer', 'presented', 'legend', 'explained', 'why', 'people', 'was', 'almost', 'hero.There', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'reenactments', 'numerous', 'talking', 'heads', 'historians', 'writers', 'who', 'make', 'countless', 'observations', 'Period', 'newspaper', 'illustrations', 'are', 'shown', 'however', 'end', '60', 'minute', 'piece', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'grown', 'weary', 'frequent', 'showings', 'photo', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'had', 'made', 'also', 'picture', 'cover', 'DVD', 'box.We', 'are', 'taken', 'back', 'childhood', 'told', 'bit', 'mother', 'how', 'friendship', 'developed', 'Mexican', 'community', 'escape', 'hanging', 'then', 'death', 'reenacted', 'interest', 'seldom', 'explained', 'how', 'Billy', 'developed', 'attitude', 'law', 'system', 'was', 'corrupt', 'why', 'engaged', 'what', 'became', 'known', 'Lincoln', 'County', 'War.This', 'DVD', 'have', 'set', 'up', 'English', 'subtitles', 'interest', 'who', 'wish', 'learn', 'more', 'historical', 'time', 'period', 'person']",American Experience: Billy the Kid
