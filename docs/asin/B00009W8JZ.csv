Marinkovich,"[6, 63]","I'd never seen Mr. Show before but recently borrowed the third season DVD from a friend because I'd heard good things and wanted to check it out. Well, I watched the first three episodes here and I scarcely cracked a smile. I think David Cross is a very funny dude but I just didn't think much of the sketch comedy going on here. None of it seemed all that clever, well-written, or well-acted. I was at least expecting something more edgy and better written than SNL but what I saw here completely fell flat. This seemed to me like amateurs trying to emulate SNL and doing a very mediocre job of it. Maybe this is one of those things you have to watch a lot of before you start to &quot;get it&quot; because it certainly didn't work for me.",2,I don't get it...,1069632000,"11 24, 2003",2003,740,"[""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'Mr.', 'Show', 'recently', 'borrowed', 'third', 'season', 'DVD', 'friend', ""'d"", 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'wanted', 'check', 'out', 'Well', 'watched', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'here', 'scarcely', 'cracked', 'smile', 'think', 'David', 'Cross', 'very', 'funny', 'dude', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'going', 'here', 'None', 'seemed', 'clever', 'well-written', 'well-acted', 'was', 'least', 'expecting', 'something', 'more', 'edgy', 'better', 'written', 'SNL', 'what', 'saw', 'here', 'completely', 'fell', 'flat', 'seemed', 'amateurs', 'trying', 'emulate', 'SNL', 'doing', 'very', 'mediocre', 'job', 'Maybe', 'one', 'things', 'have', 'watch', 'lot', 'start', 'quot', 'get', 'quot', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'work']",Mr. Show - The Complete Third Season
758766,A2N9OENVXDF643,B00009W8JZ,Brian M. Benway,"[0, 0]","There are two types of people in this world: people who have never heard of Mr. Show, and Mr. Show fanatics.  There seems to be little middle ground, and for good reason: Mr. Show is hands-down one of the most clever (and most underappreciated) sketch comedy shows in TV history.  Season three is finally here, and though it's Bob and David's most uneven season, it's also got some of the all-time best episodes (&quot;Return of the Curse of the Creature's Ghost&quot; and &quot;Peanut Butter, Eggs, and Dice&quot; come to mind).  For fans of the series, this is a must-have.  The transfer is crisp, and the audio commentaries, while not as informative as on the previous set, are still very entertaining.  Special features include some promotional materials, and yet another focus on Drugachusetts, which is a bit of overkill on a just so-so sketch if you ask me.For the unitiated, Mr. Show is a clever and topical sketch comedy show with sketches that seamlessly blend into one another.  Bob Odenkirk and David Cross, along with a great cast of supporting actors, bring a wide variety of characters to life with performances a step above your usual comedy fare.  Even when Mr. Show is not laugh-out-loud funny, it's still incredibly clever.  HBO never gave it a fair shot, which is a shame, but it appears that Mr. Show was just too hip for the room.  If you're new to the series, start with the first set of DVDs, as the episodes are a bit stronger, and there is a subtle amount of self-referencing humor, which can only be appreciated by seeing them in order.",5,Sketch Comedy at its best,1062288000,"08 31, 2003",2003,1563,"['are', 'two', 'types', 'people', 'world', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'Mr.', 'Show', 'Mr.', 'Show', 'be', 'little', 'middle', 'ground', 'good', 'reason', 'Mr.', 'Show', 'hands-down', 'one', 'most', 'clever', 'most', 'underappreciated', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'shows', 'TV', 'history', 'Season', 'three', 'finally', 'here', 'Bob', 'David', 'most', 'uneven', 'season', 'also', 'got', 'all-time', 'best', 'episodes', 'quot', 'Return', 'Curse', 'Creature', 'Ghost', 'quot', 'quot', 'Peanut', 'Butter', 'Eggs', 'Dice', 'quot', 'come', 'mind', 'fans', 'series', 'must-have', 'transfer', 'crisp', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'not', 'as', 'informative', 'previous', 'set', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Special', 'features', 'include', 'promotional', 'materials', 'yet', 'focus', 'Drugachusetts', 'bit', 'overkill', 'just', 'so-so', 'sketch', 'ask', 'me.For', 'unitiated', 'Mr.', 'Show', 'clever', 'topical', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'show', 'sketches', 'seamlessly', 'blend', 'one', 'Bob', 'Odenkirk', 'David', 'Cross', 'great', 'cast', 'supporting', 'actors', 'bring', 'wide', 'variety', 'characters', 'life', 'performances', 'step', 'usual', 'comedy', 'fare', 'Even', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Show', 'not', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'still', 'incredibly', 'clever', 'HBO', 'never', 'gave', 'fair', 'shot', 'shame', 'Mr.', 'Show', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'hip', 'room', ""'re"", 'new', 'series', 'start', 'first', 'set', 'DVDs', 'episodes', 'are', 'bit', 'stronger', 'subtle', 'amount', 'self-referencing', 'humor', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'appreciated', 'seeing', 'order']",Mr. Show - The Complete Third Season
758767,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00009W8JZ,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[2, 2]","Mr. Show...what can I say?  This is probably one of the funniest sketch comedy shows I've ever seen.  I do not get the HBO, but I did manage to see a couple of shows back when this aired in the mid to late 90's, and so, when I saw the series was being released on DVD, I knew it would be something worth getting.The show, which stars Bob Odenkirk and David Cross, is a blend of sketch, live action, and pre-recorded comedy.  The humor, while not for most, tends to really cut deep at times, dealing with a wide variety of social issues and beliefs.  Smart, funny, witty...things we don't often see so this is definitely worth looking into if you are looking for something a little edgier than SNL.Probably one of my favorite bits that I can remember is the one where David Cross is playing the host of a television program called 'The Pre-Taped Call In Show'.  Only problem is the viewers calling in can't seem to understand the concept that the show that is currently airing was the one recorded the week before, and the topic is different...sounds confusing, and even had me going, but that is what was so funny about it.  As more viewers call in and ask about the wrong topics, the host gets increasingly agitated.  Finally, he shows a series of his previous shows to try and illustrate a point, and we see the first show with him being very optimistic and having a full head of hair and the subtle loss of said hair and growing temper as the show progresses.  This really must be seen to be properly enjoyed, as I know I am unable to convey the humor properly.This two-disc set contains a number of special features, including a commentary on each episode and some promotional spots, but the real gold is in the episodes. If you are easily offended then I would say skip this, as it will probably upset you...if so, just go enjoy a nice peanut butter and egg sandwich...with dice.",5,"""Ya'll are brutalizing me...""",1073606400,"01 9, 2004",2004,1884,"['Mr.', 'Show', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'probably', 'one', 'funniest', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'HBO', 'did', 'manage', 'see', 'couple', 'shows', 'back', 'when', 'aired', 'mid', 'late', '90', 'so', 'when', 'saw', 'series', 'was', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'getting.The', 'show', 'Bob', 'Odenkirk', 'David', 'Cross', 'blend', 'sketch', 'live', 'action', 'pre-recorded', 'comedy', 'humor', 'not', 'most', 'really', 'cut', 'deep', 'times', 'dealing', 'wide', 'variety', 'social', 'issues', 'beliefs', 'Smart', 'funny', 'witty', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'see', 'so', 'definitely', 'worth', 'looking', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'little', 'edgier', 'SNL.Probably', 'one', 'favorite', 'bits', 'can', 'remember', 'one', 'where', 'David', 'Cross', 'playing', 'host', 'television', 'program', 'called', ""'The"", 'Pre-Taped', 'Call', 'Show', 'Only', 'problem', 'viewers', 'calling', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'concept', 'show', 'currently', 'airing', 'was', 'one', 'recorded', 'week', 'topic', 'different', 'confusing', 'even', 'had', 'going', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'more', 'viewers', 'call', 'ask', 'wrong', 'topics', 'host', 'increasingly', 'agitated', 'Finally', 'series', 'previous', 'shows', 'try', 'illustrate', 'point', 'see', 'first', 'show', 'being', 'very', 'optimistic', 'having', 'full', 'head', 'hair', 'subtle', 'loss', 'said', 'hair', 'growing', 'temper', 'show', 'really', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'properly', 'enjoyed', 'know', 'am', 'unable', 'convey', 'humor', 'properly.This', 'two-disc', 'set', 'number', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'commentary', 'episode', 'promotional', 'spots', 'real', 'gold', 'episodes', 'are', 'easily', 'offended', 'then', 'would', 'say', 'skip', 'will', 'probably', 'upset', 'so', 'just', 'go', 'enjoy', 'nice', 'peanut', 'butter', 'egg', 'sandwich', 'dice']",Mr. Show - The Complete Third Season

But it is true, nonetheless.Fans of Mr. Show who were ecstatic upon the release of Seasons 1 and 2 on DVD are now reaching a climax with the release of Season 3.  Bob and David hit their stride even more smoothly in Season 3, and delighted us with some truly inspired and ingenious comedy.  The part I was looking forward to most was the ""Pre-Taped Call-In Show"", which even the cast reveals on the commentary track to be their favorite sketch of the series.  The fact that the sketch is inordinantly complex for a comedy bit makes David's flawless execution of it more than funny - it is masterful!  And he performed it without the aid of cue cards, which I would have REQUIRED if I were doing it.I don't care where you buy this or how much you have to pay for it.  Just get it!
