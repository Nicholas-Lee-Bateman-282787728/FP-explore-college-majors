Some could just look at the outer surface of Bully, and see a violent flick plastered with teen drug use and rampant sex. But, looking underneath you will see a story about teens, that on their own, even coming from good homes, stray and commit the ultimite act of violence. On their own, these character's don't stand a chance, but when they bind together, they forge a chilling bond of rage. ""Want to kill a guy?"" They agree it can be done. How openly and freely they commit the crime made me laugh nervously. ""How far are they going to take this"" I wondered. The reason I wondered so, was because the teen's don't have the self confidance of a rat in a cheese factory, how could they do such a thing. Ofcourse I had to remind myself that this was just a movie, and to calm down. Watching Bully was like mental entrapment. The characters are realistic, and seem like someone you could know. The Bully himself is one of the most despisable pieces of trash you are likely to see on film. I rank him near ""Magua"" on Last of the Mohican's. Bully is a story about teen's who stray, do a terrible thing that you almost want them to do, then pay the price. Its one of recent years most captivating, and real films.  ~s.a.o.s.~",5,"Florida, the schoolyard playground",1027728000,"07 27, 2002",2002,1287,"['Bully', 'story', 'frailties', 'man', 'revenge', 'could', 'just', 'look', 'outer', 'surface', 'Bully', 'see', 'violent', 'flick', 'plastered', 'teen', 'drug', 'use', 'rampant', 'sex', 'looking', 'underneath', 'will', 'see', 'story', 'teens', 'own', 'even', 'coming', 'good', 'homes', 'stray', 'commit', 'ultimite', 'act', 'violence', 'own', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'when', 'bind', 'together', 'forge', 'chilling', 'bond', 'rage', 'Want', 'kill', 'guy', 'agree', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'How', 'openly', 'freely', 'commit', 'crime', 'made', 'nervously', 'How', 'far', 'are', 'going', 'take', 'wondered', 'reason', 'wondered', 'so', 'was', 'teen', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'self', 'confidance', 'rat', 'cheese', 'factory', 'how', 'could', 'do', 'thing', 'had', 'remind', 'was', 'just', 'movie', 'calm', 'down', 'Watching', 'Bully', 'was', 'mental', 'entrapment', 'characters', 'are', 'realistic', 'seem', 'someone', 'could', 'know', 'Bully', 'one', 'most', 'despisable', 'pieces', 'trash', 'are', 'likely', 'see', 'film', 'rank', 'Magua', 'Last', 'Mohican', 'Bully', 'story', 'teen', 'who', 'stray', 'do', 'terrible', 'thing', 'almost', 'want', 'do', 'then', 'pay', 'price', 'one', 'recent', 'years', 'most', 'captivating', 'real', 'films', '~s.a.o.s.~']",N/A

Both directors seems to enjoy provoking, rather than enlightening, their audience. And for Larry Clark, one wonders whether the theme of childhood sexuality, prevelant in most of his work, is harrowing social criticism or exploitation at its most banal.  But in BULLY, Clark gets it right:  an incredible depicition of a real-life murder in Florida by drug-addled middle-class white teens. The acting is brilliant, although Nick Stahl, a terrific actor (see HBO's ""Carnivale"") is so charismatic that it's difficult to see him as the reprehensible ""bully"" of the title.",4,Powerful Stuff,1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,732,"[""'ve"", 'rarely', 'really', 'liked', 'films', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'continue', 'watch', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'one', 'compelled', 'watch', 'read', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'movies', 'directors', 'enjoy', 'provoking', 'rather', 'enlightening', 'audience', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'one', 'theme', 'childhood', 'sexuality', 'prevelant', 'most', 'work', 'harrowing', 'social', 'criticism', 'exploitation', 'most', 'banal', 'BULLY', 'Clark', 'right', 'incredible', 'depicition', 'real-life', 'murder', 'Florida', 'drug-addled', 'middle-class', 'white', 'teens', 'acting', 'brilliant', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'terrific', 'actor', 'see', 'HBO', 'Carnivale', 'so', 'charismatic', 'difficult', 'see', 'reprehensible', 'bully', 'title']",N/A
682985,A2I8L9LTD1LQHX,B00005U14H,A. E Rothert,"[19, 24]","This film does more than confirm a long-held theory of mine that even social degenerates have sex.  It unapologetically tells an unpleasant tale of haphazard and fatal conflict resolution in a suburban setting lacking any guidance or vision of a world beyond itself with such realism that the viewer, already knowing what ultimately will come to pass, finds himself wishing someone with a brain cell will interject, ""Hey, let's get a pizza instead.""There is no reason for this murder to have happened.  Larry Clark shows us the reason it did happen: Once the idea was given life, no one could think of a reason not to do it.  Were it not based on a non-fiction account of a case in Florida, this film would no doubt be panned as lacking any sense of reality.  (A common criticism of Clark's debut flick, ""Kids."")  Alas, the aimless zombies featured here do exist in larger numbers than any of us truly wants to admit.  This is the only time I have seen them portrayed on the screen.  They are the American Pie kids, without the charm or wit.  They are the Clueless kids, without the introspection or class.  They are Jay and Silent Bob, without the ability to utter anything approaching intelligent or a sense that a world exists beyond their lives and today.  The only way one cannot be sincerely disturbed by this film is to deny its reality.  It is not surprising that so many do the latter, since denial is the easier route.Naked bodies of teenaged girls do absolutely nothing for me.  I did not find the nudity distracting at all.  For those who can't see someone naked without calling attention to either how much they enjoy it or how much it offends them: This movie is not for you.  A certain degree of maturity will be necessary to see that this movie has no protagonist, no heros, no one with whom the audience should empathize.

682987,A928WN8NV03WZ,B00005U14H,"A. M Robertson ""brother_entropy""","[4, 6]","Larry Clark has an obsession with kids, you might say it is an unhealthy obsession since it usually involves them in lurid sexual situations and almost uncomfortable scenes involving long periods of underage looking kids undressed or having kinky sex. But this is a lot better than his standard exploitation movie, and exploitation for certain, but a better one that kids or the piece of refuse called Ken Park.The movie is based off a true story that they decided to ""color"" up a bit.  About a group of young good for nothing kids in Florida who murder an abusive friend.  There is question on what really happened, and some of the people involved complain about the depictions of some of the characters, but this is common in every movie based off a true story.Marty(Brad Renfro), is a surfer/slacker who lives with his parents and spends his free time hanging out with his friend Bobby Kent, played with sleazy charm by Nick Stahl.  He is a high school dropout, and a very weak person.  Bobby continuously berates him and gets him to do his every bidding.  There is some odd sexual tension between them, and he gets Marty to go as far as dancing for money and doing phone sex for gay men.  Marty is so weak willed that he puts up with this, and everything that he heaps upon them.  Bobby looks at Marty as a friend, but is aggressive and sadistic.Things start to change when he meets Lisa, a shy girl who falls in love with him and starts to examine his life.  After Bobby rapes her best friend, she decides that something has to happen, and they must kill Bobby.  So she and her friends round up a group of their slacker friends to help her do the deed.This was a more disturbing movie than his other, not only because of the fact that it is a true story, but the defeatist nature of the characters involved.  I have heard of how the kids in Florida can be due to lack of things to due, and went to high school in an area much like that, but it still was amazing the level they go to, or don't go to.  They do drugs, engage in kinky sex, hang out, and that is about the sum of it.  What is most shocking is how readily some of them agree to the killing.  Almost as if they were deciding on what to do for the night and that seemed like the best idea.  Even though some of them are in a drugged up haze throughout the movie, few of them really stop and really seem to consider it.  Then there is the vicious and pack like nature of the killing itself.  Where they swarm on their victim with clubs and knives like a pack of animals regardless of his cries for mercy.  Only to see them start to loose it after the event.  Like they are waking up from some bad dream or a drug trip and finally realizing what they had done.  Before the killing their lives had been easy pleasures and avoidance of the outside world, now they feel real fear.The filming is typical of Larry Clark, gritty and focusing on showing things you wouldn't see in normal movies.  As well as picking a very real lookin ensamble.  Some of the characters are pretty, but don't look like movie stars.  They are bruised, don't always wear makeup, and don't always look their best.  The bonus is that for the most part, they are good actors, making you believe that you are watching normal people, not actors pretending to be normal people.The main problems with the movie are the exploitive nature that is in every Larry Clark movie.  Also his creepy obsession with sexually rebellious kids shines again.  There are many scenes that are guilty in their showing of gratuitous nudity and sex scenes.  There is a lot less than in other movies, but it turned off some people to the film killing its potential.But all in all it is a good movie despite its flaws.  Disturbing in its showing on how defeatist and shallow youth can be.  The casual nature of how they decided to kill and the fact that this is what it took them to wake up.  But then it is way too late, and their lives are no longer under their control.",4,"Better than expected, but still suffers",1098057600,"10 18, 2004",2004,3979,"['Larry', 'Clark', 'obsession', 'kids', 'might', 'say', 'unhealthy', 'obsession', 'usually', 'lurid', 'sexual', 'situations', 'almost', 'uncomfortable', 'scenes', 'involving', 'long', 'periods', 'underage', 'looking', 'kids', 'undressed', 'having', 'kinky', 'sex', 'lot', 'better', 'standard', 'exploitation', 'movie', 'exploitation', 'certain', 'better', 'one', 'piece', 'refuse', 'called', 'Ken', 'Park.The', 'movie', 'based', 'off', 'true', 'story', 'decided', 'color', 'up', 'bit', 'group', 'young', 'good', 'nothing', 'kids', 'Florida', 'who', 'murder', 'abusive', 'friend', 'question', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'people', 'involved', 'complain', 'depictions', 'characters', 'common', 'movie', 'based', 'off', 'true', 'story.Marty', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'surfer/slacker', 'who', 'parents', 'free', 'time', 'hanging', 'out', 'friend', 'Bobby', 'Kent', 'played', 'sleazy', 'charm', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'high', 'school', 'dropout', 'very', 'weak', 'person', 'Bobby', 'continuously', 'do', 'bidding', 'odd', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Marty', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'dancing', 'money', 'doing', 'phone', 'sex', 'gay', 'men', 'Marty', 'so', 'weak', 'willed', 'up', 'everything', 'Bobby', 'Marty', 'friend', 'aggressive', 'sadistic.Things', 'start', 'change', 'when', 'Lisa', 'shy', 'girl', 'who', 'love', 'examine', 'life', 'Bobby', 'best', 'friend', 'something', 'happen', 'must', 'kill', 'Bobby', 'friends', 'round', 'up', 'group', 'slacker', 'help', 'do', 'deed.This', 'was', 'more', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'other', 'not', 'only', 'fact', 'true', 'story', 'defeatist', 'nature', 'characters', 'involved', 'have', 'heard', 'how', 'kids', 'Florida', 'can', 'be', 'due', 'lack', 'things', 'due', 'went', 'high', 'school', 'area', 'much', 'still', 'was', 'amazing', 'level', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'do', 'drugs', 'engage', 'kinky', 'sex', 'hang', 'out', 'sum', 'What', 'most', 'shocking', 'how', 'readily', 'agree', 'killing', 'were', 'deciding', 'what', 'do', 'night', 'seemed', 'best', 'idea', 'Even', 'are', 'drugged', 'up', 'haze', 'movie', 'few', 'really', 'stop', 'really', 'seem', 'consider', 'Then', 'vicious', 'pack', 'nature', 'killing', 'Where', 'swarm', 'victim', 'clubs', 'knives', 'pack', 'animals', 'regardless', 'cries', 'mercy', 'Only', 'see', 'start', 'loose', 'event', 'are', 'waking', 'up', 'bad', 'dream', 'drug', 'trip', 'finally', 'realizing', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'killing', 'lives', 'had', 'been', 'easy', 'pleasures', 'avoidance', 'outside', 'world', 'now', 'feel', 'real', 'fear.The', 'filming', 'typical', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'gritty', 'focusing', 'showing', 'things', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'normal', 'movies', 'As', 'well', 'picking', 'very', 'real', 'lookin', 'ensamble', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'movie', 'stars', 'are', 'bruised', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'wear', 'makeup', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'look', 'best', 'bonus', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'good', 'actors', 'making', 'believe', 'are', 'watching', 'normal', 'people', 'not', 'actors', 'pretending', 'be', 'normal', 'people.The', 'main', 'problems', 'movie', 'are', 'exploitive', 'nature', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'movie', 'Also', 'creepy', 'obsession', 'sexually', 'rebellious', 'kids', 'shines', 'again', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'guilty', 'showing', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'sex', 'scenes', 'lot', 'less', 'other', 'movies', 'turned', 'off', 'people', 'film', 'killing', 'potential.But', 'good', 'movie', 'flaws', 'Disturbing', 'showing', 'how', 'defeatist', 'shallow', 'youth', 'can', 'be', 'casual', 'nature', 'how', 'decided', 'kill', 'fact', 'what', 'took', 'wake', 'up', 'then', 'way', 'too', 'late', 'lives', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'control']",N/A

Bully is not an excuse for nude teenagers getting stoned, as was the impression I got from Kids.Without giving away the spoiler, its about teens in a suburban enclave in South Florida who take revenge on a bully. The settting of a rapidly developing community should not be missed, as wasn't this the setting for Columbine also.....a suburban enclave without established family and social networks, overloaded with newcomers from northern cities. Lisa's mother even laments that families looked out for each other more in the Bronx, than in the so-called utopia of South Florida.As other reviewers have also stated, I didn't realize this was a true story until after seeing it. Bully is not a feel-good movie. It will disturb you, but maybe we adults need to be disturbed by this element of aimless, directionless teenagers that form a real segment of our society.What stuck me were the parents. No, they are not the idiots you'd expect on Jenny Jones and the talk show circuit. They were the type of parents to sit down at a family dinner with their kids and get involved in their business.

Larry Clark is a talented film maker who puts this message across in his films. Films mature adults can choose to watch in the comfort of their own homes, giving them a glimpse of life they hopefully never have to endure, and leaving the viewer a stronger & more liberated person. This didn't stop SPCS from stopping it screening at a film fest in Wellington 30 MINUTES before it was due to screen!! Very democratic of them! Maybe people affected by that should picket SPCS President Rev. Gordon Dempsey's church at Easter for their celebration of the crucifixion? I used to be a Catholic & I can honestly say that Catholicism was more damaging than any movie I've seen.  Anyway, I strongly encourage you to rent/buy this DVD. It's POWERFUL. It's PROVOCATIVE. It's HARD-HITTING (in both the literal & figurative senses). This is THE first DVD I've managed to talk my local video store into getting. I just hope it won't be the last.Marty (Brad Renfro) is a teen surfer who is the victim of continuous verbal and physical abuse from his scuzzy best friend Bobby (Nick Stahl), who he relies upon to take him to the beach to surf. But when Bobby rapes Marty's girlfriend Lisa (Rachel Miner- amusingly Macaulay Culkin's ex-wife!) and her friend Abby (Bijou Phillips) Bobby finally reaches the end of his rope and with the help of a group of alienated teens who have also been victimised by Bobby, they decide the only way to put an end to all their suffering is to murder him (a very bloody scene, but in context, justifiably so).BULLY is one of the best movies I've seen in the past year, with the entire cast giving brave and gutsy performances, especially Nick Stahl who is frighteningly convincing. Renfro is equally good as his victim. Highly recommended, but viewer discretion is advised. Half of the audience at the screening I attended walked out during the scene where Bobby rapes Abby; but I'll leap to the film's defence that this is what happened, it isn't sugar coated or dumbed down; so Larry Clark and his cast should be commended for their daring and bravery.BULLY is not recommended for anyone under 18 or those who are squeamish or offend easily; but is a film that deserves to be seen. This is essential viewing for parents who may find a lot here to discuss with their kids. (Not in OZ/NZ- it's R18: adults only. That's Vidiot_y2k doing his bit for the ""public good"".) And no, contrary to what SPCS say this movie is NOT a) responsible for increased crime in NZ. Blame poverty, abuse, drugs...but MOVIES? Come on!!; or b)(oddly) targeted at 16 year olds - these idiots never fail to amaze me. So I encourage you to put BULLY on your list of must see movies. This has to be one of the ten best movies I've seen this year. So who are you going to believe? Me, or some group of hormonally-challenged sad sacks who dismiss anybody who disagrees with their views as a ""minority""?

You should thank God they are not yoursBobby has been bullying his best freind Marty all their lives. This is not the big brother type of bullying that accidently emerges in even some of the best friendships. Bobby makes Marty strip in gay clubs, then keeps the money. He punches Marty for grazing the curb with his car. He smacks him for the hell of it. Makes him feel powerful.Bobby is the kid going to college. Marty surfs. But when Marty meets Lisa, he realizes for the first time he can exist as more than an abused appendage to Bobby. Bobby can't have this, and soon has Lisa after smaking her with a belt when she and Marty are having sexMarty has probably felt trapped all his life, but is now just realizing it. He is not as cunning as his evil twin, and has much more limted prospects. Lisa and her freinds decide-almost casually--Bobby should die, and she, Marty and the possee decide just to do that. These aimless, jobless, drug addled kids could not put a glee club together, but they want to try the perfect crime. I'll let you guess how long it takes for this to unravel and the kids to wind up on death row.Bully is based on a true story that happened in Florida, and would be great material for any filmaker. But it is Larry Clark's direction that makes the film a classic. Its the little details: the sweaty skin of the druged teens, the cold, dialated pupels; the way one girl says ""I have a little boy but its cool, my parrents take care of  him,"" as if she is talking about a pet fish. She never refers to him again or asks how he is.Or the way Bobby refers to every girl he meets as B---h on indroduction, or lives that center around bad hip hop, video games, and drugs. Even when these kids are shown having sex, they are breathy, sickly white, wet with druggy sweat. It is not lovemaking--it is just another way these numb, stupid, unloved kids feed their own emptiness.Where are the parents? That is not the question.

While I thought it was a powerful story filmed in an interesting (if virtually pornographic) style, I couldn't shake the feeling that the actors were somehow being exploited. Also, it was disturbing to watch so many directionless teens make a mess of their lives.But ""Bully"" is a different matter. Though based on Jim Shutze's ""novel"", it is the retelling of the real murder of a Florida youth who was brutally stabbed and bludgeoned by his own ""friends."" As with ""Kids"", Clark is intent upon making sure the teens his actors portray embody the loopy logic and emotional terrain (deadpan or wistful one minute, hysterical the next)of contemporary kids--in this case suburbanites being raised by clueless parents who seem to be willfully naive about what their kids can and will do. Half of the murderers had no special grudge against the victim, the ""bully"" of the film's title, a fact that seems especially chilling. Although you can't accuse Clark of hiding the grisly nature of what transpired, he seems as fascinated by the ""planning"" of the murder as by the act itself. One painful aspect of watching this film is that Clark makes us accutely aware that there were ample opportunities for the events to have unfolded otherwise. What if, for instance, even one of the youths involved had chickened out, or had reported the plot to the police? What if the professional hitman the teens consulted (Leo Fitzpatrick from ""Kids"") acted on his hunch that these kids didn't know what they were doing and successfully talked them out of it? Throughout the film Clark manages to keep us in the moment by leaving the underlying issue of justice unexplored. Did Bobby (played to perfection by Nich Stahl), who had dominated and abused his best friend Marty (Brad Renfro) since childhood, deserve to die?

The film does have its fare share of sex, but nothing pornographic; exploitative perhaps, especially with the young actors and all, but nothing `pert. to porn'. Personally I preferred Clark's previous film 'Kids' much more. Despite being based on actual happenings, this film didn't really seem ( to me ) to have a sense of reality. Usually I would attribute that as a good thing, but most of this just looks like it was something done up for an MTV special. This first half of the film I didn't particularly like: mainly just consisting of aimless sex and drug use... Which is fine and all, but should be made better use of. The second half of the film does get substantially better: after the crime has been committed, the character's emotions and states of mind quickly condense and implode in on them; which is orchestrated very well. It's not a bad film, but it's not a great film... It is good though.

If Clark's attempts to restage that film's controversy feel a little tired, 'Bully' is still not without merit.  The title character is a teenage boy of good, middle-class family who is expected to go to college and eventually set up business with his father.  when we first meet him, however, he is bullying his so-called best friend Marty at work in front of two nymphettes.  He later rapes both of them, physically abuses the other, and continues bullying the friend, while generally humiliating or winding up anyone who crosses his path.  Except his dad, whose stern but well-meaning entreaties to channel his intelligence, and ignore his loser friend (socially unacceptable because Italian?), together with his violently repressed homosexuality, seem to contribute to his brutishness.  His friends have no access to these mitigating circumstances, however, and decide to take extreme remedies.Critics have made much of the 58-year-old director's voyeuristic filming of very young flesh.  Although both male and female characters are about equally exposed, it is the girls who are literally eyed up and down by the lascivious camera, which lingers on especially sensitive areas.  Besides being morally dubious, the method affects our reception of the film.  'Bully' tries so hard to key into the mindset of the young characters, their language, their physical rituals around each other, their raging hormones determining their thoughtless actions, their humour and likable amorality, their music and interests.  He is particularly good at eking the desperate hopelessness of adolescence, the way a teenager under a crumpled bed can seem like a soul lost behind a mountainous desert.  But the gaze is that of a dirty old man, and therefore unwittingly aligns itself with the adult characters he apparently blames, perversely introducing a consorious attitude.  This doesn't make the characters less understandable or sympathetic, but it does make you think they're being cheated on.  It IS important to show the body in the film, as it is its principle metaphor, a site of violence (with marks as evidence), of exploitation, abuse, vulnerability, but also individuality and experiment (in the film's fuunniest sequence, a wax-dripping sex scene manages to incorporate, rather than be interrupted by, a mobile phone call.It's only when the film reaches the agonising pitch of its climax that one realises how controlled the seemingly aimless film-making had been, how attuned to a rhythm, how revelatory of characters' lives, leading us to empathise with even the dopiest slacker.  Ironically, it is also at this point that the film becomes most conventional, restrained by 'true story' morality clashing with its pretensions to Camus.",3,So THIS is how you deal with bullies...,1015977600,"03 13, 2002",2002,2864,"[""'Bully"", 'latest', 'pseudo-sociological', 'sadopsychosexual', 'sexploitation', 'flick', 'notorious', ""'Kids"", 'director', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'Clark', 'attempts', 'restage', 'film', 'controversy', 'feel', 'little', 'tired', ""'Bully"", 'still', 'not', 'merit', 'title', 'character', 'teenage', 'boy', 'good', 'middle-class', 'family', 'who', 'expected', 'go', 'college', 'eventually', 'set', 'up', 'business', 'father', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'however', 'bullying', 'so-called', 'best', 'friend', 'Marty', 'work', 'front', 'two', 'nymphettes', 'later', 'physically', 'other', 'bullying', 'friend', 'generally', 'humiliating', 'winding', 'up', 'anyone', 'who', 'path', 'dad', 'stern', 'well-meaning', 'entreaties', 'channel', 'intelligence', 'ignore', 'loser', 'friend', 'socially', 'unacceptable', 'Italian', 'together', 'violently', 'repressed', 'homosexuality', 'seem', 'contribute', 'brutishness', 'friends', 'have', 'access', 'mitigating', 'circumstances', 'however', 'decide', 'take', 'extreme', 'remedies.Critics', 'have', 'made', 'much', '58-year-old', 'director', 'voyeuristic', 'filming', 'very', 'young', 'flesh', 'male', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'equally', 'exposed', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'literally', 'eyed', 'up', 'down', 'lascivious', 'camera', 'especially', 'sensitive', 'areas', 'being', 'morally', 'dubious', 'method', 'reception', 'film', ""'Bully"", 'tries', 'so', 'hard', 'key', 'mindset', 'young', 'characters', 'language', 'physical', 'rituals', 'other', 'raging', 'hormones', 'determining', 'thoughtless', 'actions', 'humour', 'likable', 'amorality', 'music', 'interests', 'particularly', 'good', 'eking', 'desperate', 'hopelessness', 'adolescence', 'way', 'teenager', 'crumpled', 'bed', 'can', 'seem', 'soul', 'lost', 'mountainous', 'desert', 'gaze', 'dirty', 'old', 'man', 'therefore', 'unwittingly', 'adult', 'characters', 'apparently', 'perversely', 'introducing', 'consorious', 'attitude', ""n't"", 'make', 'characters', 'less', 'understandable', 'sympathetic', 'make', 'think', ""'re"", 'being', 'cheated', 'important', 'show', 'body', 'film', 'principle', 'metaphor', 'site', 'violence', 'marks', 'evidence', 'exploitation', 'abuse', 'vulnerability', 'also', 'individuality', 'experiment', 'film', 'fuunniest', 'sequence', 'wax-dripping', 'sex', 'scene', 'incorporate', 'rather', 'be', 'interrupted', 'mobile', 'phone', 'call.It', 'only', 'when', 'film', 'agonising', 'pitch', 'climax', 'one', 'how', 'controlled', 'seemingly', 'aimless', 'film-making', 'had', 'been', 'how', 'attuned', 'rhythm', 'how', 'revelatory', 'characters', 'lives', 'leading', 'empathise', 'even', 'dopiest', 'slacker', 'Ironically', 'also', 'point', 'film', 'most', 'conventional', 'restrained', ""'true"", 'story', 'morality', 'clashing', 'pretensions', 'Camus']",N/A

683019,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005U14H,D. Litton,"[4, 6]","I love director Larry Clark. He has a real talent for getting right under his audience's skin with the very first frame of his films. In ""Kids,"" the sight of young actor Leo Fitzpatrick and his character's latest attraction was enough to shock one into following through with the film. And now, in his best film since that previous effort, Clark delivers intensity and powerhouse directing in ""Bully.""The film chronicles events that took place in Southern Florida in July of 1993, centering around two best friends, Marty and Bobby (Brad Renfro, Nick Stahl). Their friendship reminds me of the bond between mid-20's murderers Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold, who were friends of a sort out of their twisted pathology for murder and deception. It's not so much the act, but the nuances of their bond that is seen within that of Marty and Bobby: Bobby, an aggressive fellow, keeps the passive, emotionally needy Marty under his wing. There are even hints that Bobby might have homosexual tendencies, which would further explain his need to exact a brutish demeanor in the presence of his friends.It is Marty, however, who has cause for the events to come. The two boys cross paths with Ali and Lisa (Bijou Phillips, Rachel Miner), two young girls who instantly take a liking to Marty and Bobby. Of the two, Lisa is the quiet, reserved one, while Ali makes it a point to let Bobby know she's available for play. Marty and Lisa get into a relationship, one that involves sex, pot-smoking, hanging out, until one day, Lisa begins to question his friendship with Bobby.The film is unique in that it's one of the few based on reality whose characters possess evils so undeniably chilling, you almost think (or wish) it was fictional. Fed up with Bobby's bantering and trouble-making, Lisa proposes to Marty the idea of killing him, ridding the world of his problematic behavior. At first hesitant, Marty warms to the idea of no longer being the subject of forced anal rapes or bruises and bloody lips and noses, and soon, the two have gathered a group of suburban teenagers to carry out their master plan.The middle third of the film, prior to the murder, finds the group in an elated stupor that is a result of various controlled substances, and the knowledge that they have the power to take someone's life into their own hands. Of the seven conspirators, Lisa is the most effective at creating a sense of chilling dread: under the performance of Rachel Miner, we come to an understanding that Lisa is a girl who is not what she first appeared to be. Renfro also does well in turning his character from a banter object into someone exacting cold revenge.After a well-crafted and gratifyingly suspenseful murder sequence that finds the group confused, the film takes a turn into darker waters, examining the effects of quilt, fear of discovery, and the placement of blame. At first resolute and steadfast, Lisa has now become hysterical and obsessive about hiding the truth (at one point, she makes the mistake of revealing the murder to a friend by pleading for a ride to the murder scene); her cousin, Derek (Daniel Franzese), frantically searches for the closest possible ally, confiding in a not-so-trustworthy youth; Marty, who is somewhat relieved that he is rid of Bobby, still feels pangs of guilt and fear, as do the rest of the group.Clark is careful to keep our attentions focused on certain things at certain times. In the beginning, we bear witness to the laying of plans. Once the plans are carried out, we then must watch as these characters unravel internally, making mistakes and talking to the wrong people. Since the film is based on reality, those familiar with history will know how it ends up, but Clark's ability to ratchet up the suspense and underlying sense of dread is top-notch, as is his cast, who remain remarkable through to the end.The real kicker of a film like ""Bully"" is its unwillingness to takes sides by straying from the usual preachy methods that tend to dominate such films. In the end, it leaves us with our own thoughts concerning Bobby's murder, and we must make our own decision about whether or not he deserved such a fate as he received. Were Marty and Lisa justified in their actions? The people of Broward County didn't think so, and neither does this critic. But that's up to you to decide.",5,Clark delivers intensity and powerhouse directing.,1015718400,"03 10, 2002",2002,4334,"['love', 'director', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'real', 'talent', 'getting', 'right', 'audience', 'skin', 'very', 'first', 'frame', 'films', 'Kids', 'sight', 'young', 'actor', 'Leo', 'Fitzpatrick', 'character', 'latest', 'attraction', 'was', 'enough', 'shock', 'one', 'following', 'film', 'now', 'best', 'film', 'previous', 'effort', 'Clark', 'intensity', 'powerhouse', 'directing', 'Bully', 'film', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'Southern', 'Florida', 'July', '1993', 'centering', 'around', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'Marty', 'Bobby', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'friendship', 'bond', 'mid-20', 'murderers', 'Richard', 'Loeb', 'Nathan', 'Leopold', 'who', 'were', 'friends', 'sort', 'twisted', 'pathology', 'murder', 'deception', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'act', 'nuances', 'bond', 'seen', 'Marty', 'Bobby', 'Bobby', 'aggressive', 'fellow', 'passive', 'emotionally', 'needy', 'Marty', 'wing', 'are', 'even', 'hints', 'Bobby', 'might', 'have', 'homosexual', 'tendencies', 'would', 'further', 'explain', 'need', 'exact', 'brutish', 'demeanor', 'presence', 'friends.It', 'Marty', 'however', 'who', 'cause', 'events', 'come', 'two', 'boys', 'cross', 'paths', 'Ali', 'Lisa', 'Bijou', 'Phillips', 'Rachel', 'Miner', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'instantly', 'take', 'liking', 'Marty', 'Bobby', 'two', 'Lisa', 'quiet', 'reserved', 'one', 'Ali', 'point', 'let', 'Bobby', 'know', 'available', 'play', 'Marty', 'Lisa', 'get', 'relationship', 'one', 'sex', 'pot-smoking', 'hanging', 'out', 'one', 'day', 'Lisa', 'question', 'friendship', 'Bobby.The', 'film', 'unique', 'one', 'few', 'based', 'reality', 'characters', 'possess', 'evils', 'so', 'undeniably', 'chilling', 'almost', 'think', 'wish', 'was', 'fictional', 'Fed', 'up', 'Bobby', 'bantering', 'trouble-making', 'Lisa', 'Marty', 'idea', 'killing', 'ridding', 'world', 'problematic', 'behavior', 'first', 'hesitant', 'Marty', 'idea', 'longer', 'being', 'subject', 'forced', 'anal', 'rapes', 'bruises', 'bloody', 'lips', 'noses', 'soon', 'two', 'have', 'gathered', 'group', 'suburban', 'teenagers', 'carry', 'out', 'master', 'plan.The', 'middle', 'third', 'film', 'prior', 'murder', 'group', 'elated', 'stupor', 'result', 'various', 'controlled', 'substances', 'knowledge', 'have', 'power', 'take', 'someone', 'life', 'own', 'hands', 'seven', 'conspirators', 'Lisa', 'most', 'effective', 'creating', 'sense', 'chilling', 'dread', 'performance', 'Rachel', 'Miner', 'come', 'understanding', 'Lisa', 'girl', 'who', 'not', 'what', 'first', 'appeared', 'be', 'Renfro', 'also', 'well', 'turning', 'character', 'banter', 'object', 'someone', 'exacting', 'cold', 'revenge.After', 'well-crafted', 'gratifyingly', 'suspenseful', 'murder', 'sequence', 'group', 'confused', 'film', 'turn', 'darker', 'waters', 'examining', 'effects', 'quilt', 'fear', 'discovery', 'placement', 'blame', 'first', 'resolute', 'steadfast', 'Lisa', 'now', 'become', 'hysterical', 'obsessive', 'hiding', 'truth', 'one', 'point', 'mistake', 'revealing', 'murder', 'friend', 'pleading', 'ride', 'murder', 'scene', 'cousin', 'Derek', 'Daniel', 'Franzese', 'frantically', 'closest', 'possible', 'ally', 'confiding', 'not-so-trustworthy', 'youth', 'Marty', 'who', 'somewhat', 'relieved', 'rid', 'Bobby', 'still', 'feels', 'pangs', 'guilt', 'fear', 'do', 'rest', 'group.Clark', 'careful', 'keep', 'attentions', 'focused', 'certain', 'things', 'certain', 'times', 'beginning', 'bear', 'witness', 'laying', 'plans', 'plans', 'are', 'carried', 'then', 'must', 'watch', 'characters', 'unravel', 'internally', 'making', 'mistakes', 'talking', 'wrong', 'people', 'film', 'based', 'reality', 'familiar', 'history', 'will', 'know', 'how', 'up', 'Clark', 'ability', 'ratchet', 'up', 'suspense', 'underlying', 'sense', 'dread', 'top-notch', 'cast', 'who', 'remain', 'remarkable', 'end.The', 'real', 'kicker', 'film', 'Bully', 'unwillingness', 'sides', 'straying', 'usual', 'preachy', 'methods', 'tend', 'dominate', 'such', 'films', 'end', 'own', 'thoughts', 'concerning', 'Bobby', 'murder', 'must', 'make', 'own', 'decision', 'not', 'deserved', 'fate', 'received', 'Were', 'Marty', 'Lisa', 'justified', 'actions', 'people', 'Broward', 'County', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'neither', 'critic', 'up', 'decide']",N/A

683022,A2SVRQ64PMD8ZD,B00005U14H,"""elchanco""","[5, 10]","I really wanted to like this movie...So I watched the film. At first I was interested and then let down. The dialogue seemed to be very forced and unauthentic, there was pointless sex (yes, we know that teens have sex and lots of it, so we don't need countless crotch-shots) and parts of the script were just odd. It has many unrealistic portrayals of teens and I found myself laughing at times and others, just embarrassed for Larry Clark, who really tries to be hip. There is an explicit rape scene, which I must admit, is impressive in its intensity, but I was left confused afterward. Nick Stahl rapes Bijou Phillips and then she runs out of the bedroom and tells Rachel Miner she's been raped and runs outside bumping into Stahl's father. He walks inside and into his bathroom, where he meets Stahl, who is still naked and the two spark up a conversation about a stereo store they had been talking about. Why was this included? I found that it just destroyed the mood set by the previous scene.There is also a major problem with casting credibility. I had a hard time believing that Stahl, with his relatively small physique, could bully Brad Renfro, who is much larger. On a purely psychological level however, Stahl is masterful in creating a truly creepy character and I don't doubt that a large part of the bullying aspect is the psychological part of it. I think if the two switched roles, we would have a far more believable story. On a closer look, the actors do an admirable job of creating such stupid kids. But I felt bad for the actors, in the hands of another director this could have been made into a masterpiece that doesn't rely on exploiting them.Parts of the film seemed to be accepted too easily. Someone mentions killing Stahl and everyone's just like, ""yeah, sounds like a plan"". I eventually felt sympathy for Stahl's character and could care less about Renfro and his co-horts, which I suspect is exactly the point; that it was Rachel Miner (who herself had many bad acting scenes) who was the vicious one.If you liked Kids, you should adore this. I would urge people to seek out Clark's other film ""Another Day In Paradise"" if you haven't. Also, ""Bully"" is based on a true story from the early nineties, which left me asking, ""why are the actors watching Eminem videos in the film, when he was only going through puberty in the early nineties?"" I don't know.After the murder, the film does pick up.  The dialogue gets better, and there is even some good satire about teen/parental relationships.  The last moments of the film are powerful, when we see Clark playng a cameo of the hitman's father.  The last scene, of the kids in a courtroom is also very good, with them still bickering like morons.  And then we see each character and the sentence they receive, where the film abrubtly end with no music for a few seconds, that I thought made quite an impact.The film is definitely worth watching, and no doubt some will enjoy (although ""enjoy"" may not be the right word) it immensly, but I couldn't help feeling like a shock-artist had tried to put one over on me.",3,oddly made,1012435200,"01 31, 2002",2002,3093,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'So', 'watched', 'film', 'first', 'was', 'interested', 'then', 'let', 'down', 'dialogue', 'seemed', 'be', 'very', 'forced', 'unauthentic', 'was', 'pointless', 'sex', 'yes', 'know', 'teens', 'have', 'sex', 'lots', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'countless', 'crotch-shots', 'parts', 'script', 'were', 'just', 'odd', 'many', 'unrealistic', 'portrayals', 'teens', 'found', 'laughing', 'times', 'others', 'just', 'embarrassed', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'who', 'really', 'be', 'hip', 'explicit', 'rape', 'scene', 'must', 'admit', 'impressive', 'intensity', 'was', 'left', 'confused', 'afterward', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'Bijou', 'Phillips', 'then', 'bedroom', 'tells', 'Rachel', 'Miner', 'been', 'raped', 'runs', 'bumping', 'Stahl', 'father', 'walks', 'inside', 'bathroom', 'where', 'Stahl', 'who', 'still', 'naked', 'two', 'spark', 'up', 'conversation', 'stereo', 'store', 'had', 'been', 'talking', 'Why', 'was', 'included', 'found', 'just', 'destroyed', 'mood', 'set', 'previous', 'scene.There', 'also', 'major', 'problem', 'casting', 'credibility', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'Stahl', 'relatively', 'small', 'physique', 'could', 'bully', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'who', 'much', 'larger', 'purely', 'psychological', 'level', 'however', 'Stahl', 'masterful', 'creating', 'truly', 'creepy', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'large', 'part', 'bullying', 'aspect', 'psychological', 'part', 'think', 'two', 'switched', 'roles', 'would', 'have', 'far', 'more', 'believable', 'story', 'closer', 'look', 'actors', 'do', 'admirable', 'job', 'creating', 'such', 'stupid', 'kids', 'felt', 'bad', 'actors', 'hands', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'masterpiece', ""n't"", 'rely', 'exploiting', 'them.Parts', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'accepted', 'too', 'easily', 'Someone', 'mentions', 'killing', 'Stahl', 'everyone', 'just', 'yeah', 'plan', 'eventually', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'Stahl', 'character', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'Renfro', 'co-horts', 'suspect', 'exactly', 'point', 'was', 'Rachel', 'Miner', 'who', 'had', 'many', 'bad', 'acting', 'scenes', 'who', 'was', 'vicious', 'one.If', 'liked', 'Kids', 'should', 'adore', 'would', 'urge', 'people', 'seek', 'out', 'Clark', 'other', 'film', 'Day', 'Paradise', 'have', ""n't"", 'Also', 'Bully', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'early', 'nineties', 'left', 'asking', 'why', 'are', 'actors', 'watching', 'Eminem', 'videos', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'going', 'puberty', 'early', 'nineties', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.After', 'murder', 'film', 'pick', 'up', 'dialogue', 'better', 'even', 'good', 'satire', 'teen/parental', 'relationships', 'last', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'powerful', 'when', 'see', 'Clark', 'playng', 'cameo', 'hitman', 'father', 'last', 'scene', 'kids', 'courtroom', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'still', 'bickering', 'morons', 'then', 'see', 'character', 'sentence', 'receive', 'where', 'film', 'abrubtly', 'end', 'music', 'few', 'seconds', 'thought', 'made', 'quite', 'impact.The', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'doubt', 'will', 'enjoy', 'enjoy', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'right', 'word', 'immensly', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'shock-artist', 'had', 'tried', 'put', 'one', 'over']",N/A

Its the story of Marty, a kid who has to rely on his abusive friend for rides to clubs and the beach.  It all begins to change when Marty meets Lisa who gets the ball rolling on killing Bobby.  There are no good guys or girls in this film.  Everyone is a promiscuous, drug addicted kid with a mean streak.  Bobby probably was the worst of them but Lisa and Marty especially were no different. Lisa and Bobby thought it was funny how this guy died!  There is no real remorse at all.Bully is disturbing and you see it all in this one.

683037,A2YM2NM7YZA24Q,B00005U14H,Haseeb,"[10, 13]","This film is made for all of those people who are seriously contemplating violence as a form of retribution.  Based on a true story in south Florida, this powerful film takes us into the world of suburban teens who seem to be mostly typical to their environment.  In the earlier generation, it used to be sex, drugs and rock and roll.  Now it's sex, drugs, violent video games and rap music.From the very beginning of the film, it's made very clear that Marty is the primary target for the bully's reprehensible behavior.  The bully forces Marty to strip dance at a gay club, routinely beats up on him and insults him infront of others.  The bully rapes Marty, abuses Marty's girlfriend and rapes another girl.  Of all of the kids that are part of the plot, the bully is the one who seemingly has it all; a nice car, comes from a nice family with high expectations and has a future.  His father plans to set him up as a manager of his own stereo store after he finishes college.  Interestingly, the bully's father believes that his son is better than Marty and the other kids and hence advises his son to stay away from Marty and the others.  The bully goes against his father's advice and hangs out with Marty anyway.  It seems like the bully derives a sense of empowerment from being able to beat up on Marty and talk to the others any way he pleases.  There comes a point where Marty's girlfriend can't stand to see the bully mess with him anymore.  She suggests that they should kill him.  A group of kids then band together and devise a plan to kill the bully and throw his body in the swamp for the alligators.Different people will get different things out of this film and surely few people will forget it.

I am quite sure that multiple viewers found this film to be most disturbing in every aspect.  Every so often you might hear on the news, on the radio, or from another individual that someone was killed or murdered.  It could be anybody.  Some may think about that, some may talk about it, and some might not even care.  In any event, you (most of the time) do not want to witness how it happened.  This film is just the opposite.  All around the United States, numerous crimes similar to the one included in this film happen everyday involving teenagers. (especially in big cities)  Most of everybody will be used to hearing about analogous actions that occur everywhere.  However, how would you feel if you visually observed what really happened?  Think about that.What I was most impressed about this film is how unforeseeably real it appeared.  Following my initial viewing of the film, I asked myself one question, ""Is this a major motion picture or a community shot home video?""This critically acclaimed motion picture features a superb cast (IN OSCAR-CALIBER PERFORMANCES) that get the chance to widely express their talents on the big screen.  Marty Puccio (Brad Renfro) is a troubled teenager that gets constantly beat up by his so-called best friend, Bobby Kent (portrayed by Nick Stahl).  It's this that Marty continuously reaches his breaking point.  Most audiences feel sympathy towards Marty and just want something to be done to Bobby.  Ever since Marty was little, Bobby has been an appalling influence to Marty.  That, of which is the probable reason why Marty turned out so badly.  Marty's girlfriend, Lisa (Rachel Miner) along with her friend, Ali (Bijou Phillips) experience how horrific Bobby is (or in Lisa's words, ""Bobby is everybody's problem."")  Them, along with three other teenagers (WHO PERSONALLY DID NOT EVEN KNOW BOBBY) are peer-pressured into taking hand to a crime that ultimately stumbled America.Finally, another aspect of this film that I did enjoy is the music.  Truthfully, I am not a big fan of rap music, but in this particular case I think I will make an exception.  Each scene is well-developed more as the music plays.  It sets the mood brilliantly.  For anyone that's interested, go out and buy the soundtrack.As I have mentioned before, the realism is extremely strong and you will not believe your eyes after your first viewing of the film.  However, THIS FILM IS NOT FOR EVERYONE and certainly not for children.  But, if you are the type that loves suspenseful cinema, hey, take a risk and give this movie a chance.

The subject matter is a little disturbing and the reality of this actually happening is another reason.The movie takes place in FL and in several scenarios throughout the film, I could see where something like this could happen in real life. I am in my 40's now, but this is sort of how the youth I went to school with acted and I can only imagine that it is even worse today than back then.The main character Bobby, is basically a big bully to all of his friends in their little social circle. His best friend is the person he picks on the most. There is a lot of sex and drugs ,no surprise, but the extent of the drug use is far from my days in High School. I don't want to give to much away, but after he screws the girls, then treats them like trash, Bobby (Nick Stall)  beats on his buddies ,steals and basically has some serious psychological issues. It also gives you the impression that the parents of this kid think that he is an Angel, but they lack any kind of parental skills,like discipline ,spending time with their son,and overall parenting. They think that his pal that he beats on is the problem.After enough of this kind of behavior they decide to do something about it, and ultimately it ruins everyone in the groups life. I am trying not to give to much away, but it is extremely disturbing. I think it's one of those films that is so disturbing to watch that you can not quit watching it. It will haunt you for a day or two. It reminds me a lot of the way Trainspotting made me feel.

683044,A1PNF4W765MBYA,B00005U14H,jason,"[8, 10]","It's pretty interesting when you think about it but Brad Renro has been in two of the most highly acclaimed films of 2001 (Bully and his smaller role in the equally brilliant Ghost World starring Thora Birch and Steve Buschemi)but nobody has really seen anything by him since he made his debut in The Client with Susan Sarandon back in the early 90's when he was just a young teen. After seeing Kids when it first came out back in the mid- late 90's I was totally hooked to Larry Clark's work (Another Day in Paradise is also a great little film though it has two bigger stars and went straight to video). People either loved Kids or hated it (the same with Gummo)or people understood it or didn't understand it. Most people were turned onto Kids from word of mouth and really weren't smaller indie film fans and weren't expecting what they got. I guess the same can be said about Bully. People either love it or hate it. Yeah there is lots of nudity (in some scenes it's almost a soft porn)but to respond to one person's complaint... all the actresses and actors are 20 or over and weren't playing high school kids in this film. All of Clark's films come with some sort of controversary and you have to understand, indie films aren't your normal run of the mill bigger budget films and can get away with more and are able to shock you more. The things that happen in this film could and do happen everywhere in America and Clark shows and tells it like it is and doesn't water it down or doesn't cut any corners trying to show us anything. If this were a bigger budget film and able to hit larger auidences it would definetly be slapped with a nc-17 rating but since it wasn't it just hit small independent screens and was alsmot straight to video much like Clark's other work and slapped with a unrated sticker. It sad that many people will miss out on this film and it will go unnoticed by many but hopefully word of mouth will help this film like it did for other indie films because that's truly how they are noticed by a majority of the viewers. I forgot all about Bully and stubmled onto it at my local video store (which has two copies all the way at the bottom of the shelf)and instantly loved it and hope to get it on dvd soon. As for the stars...it's kinda sad to see the bigger name of Bijou Phillips billed over the true female lead Rachel Miner (who was married to Maccully Caulkin). Miner turns out a super performance while Phillips is on screen for a while and then comes back a little later. Renfro also turns in a super performance as does the rest of the cast (which is a great thing about smaller films like this where money and egos don't play a part in the performance of the actor and it's all heart). Like i said...it is loved or hated and indie films aren't for everyone and are alot more gritty and truthful and are allowed more than the bigger budgeted films most people are used to but films like these are real and don't shy away from anything and that's what makes them so amazing to watch.

683045,A2TT4AA3QO0DPY,B00005U14H,Jay Young,"[4, 4]","I have heard about Bully for a long time, and finally decided to watch it. It's a well-acted, well-directed, and powerful movie.Bobby Kent's behavior goes beyond that of a bully- he's a borderline sadist/sociopath. He constantly verbally and physically (and possibly sexually) abuses his best friend, Marty Puccio. In addition, he is beginning to develop a taste for rape, and calls whatever girls he's with demeaning names. When Bobby rapes Marty's new girlfriend Lisa and her best friend Ali, Marty and Lisa decide to kill him. They take Ali and four other friends and lure Bobby to the swamp, and stab him. They try to keep it a secret, but the psychological consequences of killing someone are more than they bargained for, and most of them tell someone. Eventually, someone makes an anonymous phone call, and all 7 of them are arrested and convicted.Bully is educational, but hardly entertaining. To elaborate, it shows what happens when kids have no direction in their lives, and no sense of right and wrong. Neither Marty nor any of the other main characters appear to have any kind of goal and direction in life. Marty especially didn't seem to have any kind of standards about how to act towards others (he physically abuses Lisa at one point) or how he expected others to act towards him, which makes dealing with bullying more difficult. All he knew is that Bobby made his life miserable. They didn't even try to bring charges against Bobbby, or deal with him in any kind of legal way. Bobby is a vile individual, but he doesn't die because of his sins, but because his killers live in a moral vacuum. In addition, Bully shows the tragic results of apathetic parenting. For example, towards the beginning of the movie, Bobby punches Marty in the face several times after he runs his car on the curb. Marty then asks his parents if they can move, and his father tells him, ""we can't all quit our jobs just because our son is having problems."" His parents show no interest in calling Bobby's parents, the police, or helping Marty with the problems at all.Be warned though, there's not one scene that is not disturbing in one way or another- be the scene about the bullying, nudity, rape, or psychological/emotional distress- this is a movie only for strong-stomached viewers, and hence is not entertaining.

683048,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00005U14H,Jeffrey Leach,"[1, 2]","In 1993 twenty year old Bobby Kent turned up dead in the Florida Everglades. We as a society are not particularly surprised when yet another killing flashes across the evening news, regardless of the age of the victim, because we all recognize that we live in an increasingly violent society in which murder is merely one aspect of that fact. Bobby Kent's murder soon drew additional attention when the media discovered the facts behind the case, facts that implicated seven young people in a conspiracy to commit murder. Even worse, some of the individuals charged with the murder were Bobby's close friends. As the threads of the case came together, the picture that emerged painted a chilling portrait of a group of young people totally lacking in morality. These youths routinely engaged in a host of illegal activities. Moreover, most of the kids involved in this horrific crime were definitely not social castoffs, but moved in the comfort of upper middle class circles. Larry Clark, the director who brought us the movie &quot;Kids,&quot; saw yet another story embodying his favorite theme of young people on a rampage and decided to bring the strange story of Bobby Kent to the silver screen. The result is &quot;Bully.&quot;According to Clark's film, the world of Bobby Kent is an unpleasant one. Constantly hounded by his overbearing father to succeed in life, Kent develops a schizophrenic personality in which he plays the good guy at home while acting the part of an aggressive, bullying thug towards his friends. Bobby's best friend, Marty Puccio, often weathers the worst of these attacks. Most of the time Marty likes being around his buddy, but face slapping, the threats and profanity, the embarrassing verbal threats, and certain increasingly odd antics start to take a toll on their relationship. Still, Marty's personality embraces a level of passivity that would probably have made him a victim indefinitely if he had never met Lisa Connelly. Lisa, a waifish girl with numerous psychological inadequacies of her own, nearly flips cartwheels over landing a guy like Marty as a boyfriend. The only flaw Lisa sees in Puccio is his sycophantic adoration of the sadistic Bobby Kent.Connelly cannot stand to see her lover suffer such degradations and after a few run-ins with Marty's buddy she suddenly decides to get rid of Bobby Kent once and for all. Lisa enlists her friend Ali to help in the mission, and as the idea gains momentum a whole host of oddballs drift into their orbit. Ali's sometime boyfriend, dunderheaded Donny Semenec, joins the cause along with another hopeless youth by the name of Heather. Derek, a videogame geek who simply goes along with the crowd, soon casts his lot with the rest of this gang. At first, the idea of getting rid of Bobby is just a way to pass the time, a funny little idea worth nothing more than a few chortles to this group of misfits. But as time passes everyone in the group begins to believe in the idea, so much so that they approach &quot;The Hitman,&quot; a guy everyone believes is the leader of a gang of local white toughs, in order to carry out the crime. The crime does occur, but the ineptness of everyone involved soon leads to mass arrests and the inevitable trial.The film unflinchingly shows us the brutal murder of Bobby Kent, but director Larry Clark's interest lies more in the processes that led to the crime than in the actual killing itself. &quot;Bully&quot; reveals to the viewer a world so detached from the rest of society that one wonders if this is total fiction or an accurate depiction of the moral degeneracy racing through today's youth. These young people lived in a world of immorality the likes of which rarely come to light. Moreover, Clark presents the parents of these damaged souls as either completely ignorant of what their children did or simply unaware of their bad behavior because they are too concerned about their own lives. The most shocking scenes in the movie centers on how the kids never seem bothered about what they are planning. Right or wrong never, ever, enters the picture as the gang contemplates committing the ultimate crime. Clark is obviously indicting society for its failure to instill any sense of human decency in its children. Popular culture and materialism certainly play a role in this problem since most of the kids in this movie drive nice cars, can buy whatever they want, and have an overabundance of free time in which to engage in the most reckless activities.There are some recognizable actors appearing in &quot;Bully,&quot; from Brad Renfro to Nick Stahl to Rachel Miner. They all do a good job with their performances, with special mention going to Stahl as Bobby Kent and Bijou Phillips as the disturbing Ali Willis. The biggest problem I had with the movie is that Clark makes his point about twenty or thirty minutes into the film and then repeats the theme continually until the end. How many scenes of reckless, shocking behavior do we need to see before we shout out loud &quot;WE GET THE IDEA&quot;! I understand that Clark tries to emphasize how directionless these people are, but that still did not stop my girlfriend from walking away from the film about an hour in. She quickly wearied of seeing the same stuff over and over and I can't say I blame her. The DVD offers an uncut, unrated version of the film and includes some cast interviews, an interview with Larry Clark, and a trailer. Over the top and deeply disturbing, &quot;Bully&quot; will give you something to think about long after the film end",4,Deeply Disturbing,1070236800,"12 1, 2003",2003,5560,"['1993', 'twenty', 'year',

I knew it was from the director if ""Kids"" so I sort of prepared myself for anything.  I don't think you CAN prepare yourself for this one.I'm not so old that I don't remember what it was like to be a teenager and the thing that disturbed me most about this movie was how much some of the characters reminded me of people I knew and still know.  I had no idea where the movie was going, so when it turned out that: A) it was about a group of kids that plan to murder the local bully and B) it was a true story; I was creeped out pretty bad.  I can't stop thinking about this movie, it got under my skin pretty bad.  I love it when a movie like this somehow gets under my radar so that by the time I finally see it, it's very unexpected.  I'd like to call it ""an unexpected pleasure"" but it was far to complex to be called a pleasure.I don't want to spoil this movie for anyone else, but suffice to say, it is an incredible flick.  The most incredible thing about it is how real it feels.  The performances, the characters, the stupid situations, the way they speak their dialogue and shots of those blank expressions on their faces.  The cast of young actors in this film are just incredible.  Some people have accused it of glamorizing the event, but this movie is about as glamorous as a shotgun blast to the head. There was nothing sexy about the sex scenes.  Even the more ""romantic"" ones seemed desperate and gross.  The director showed these kids as kids like this truly are: lost, stupid, wasted, desperate and possessed of an apathy so powerful that not even death can penetrate it.The most incredible thing is that no matter how stupid they are, no matter what terrible things they did to one another, there's still something so sad about them that, at least for me, I couldn't help but feel sorry for all of them.  They're all broken somehow. It's like watching a dog with a broken leg limping down the street.  The same dog that would bite you if you pulled over and tried to help it. Just cause he bit you doesn't make him any less pathetic.I can't say I loved this movie, but I have to say that it made me think and moved me more than any movie has in a long time.  Probably the first movie I've seen like it since ""Requiem for a Dream.""

683050,A2EBLL2OYEQJN9,B00005U14H,Jessica Lux,"[43, 45]","Bully is based on a true high school crime which took place in Cooper City, Florida.  Boyhood friends Marty Puccio (Brad Renfro) and Bobby Kent (Nick Stahl) traveled in the same circles of casual drug use and loose women with a group of friends who rarely attended high school classes.  Bobby bullied Marty their entire lives, raped both Marty and their girl friends, and pulled aggressive stunts such as capturing a local drifter and forcing him to perform homosexual acts on camera.  Director Larry Clark presents a gripping portrait of bullying and submission, and of how hard it is to stand up to the bully when he's been in power for a good sixteen or more years.With the high school sexual acts and drug use, this film will inevitably be compared to Clark's earlier work, Kids.  Bully, however, is based on a true crime with copious court records, confessions, witness statements, and a non-fiction book about the subjects.  Any reviewer who attacks the plausibility of the film needs to look no further than Martin Puccio, vs. State of Florida, Appellee. No. 86,242; November 20, 1997.  Clark takes the facts of the case and presents a movie which illustrates the fear and loathing of someone who submits to a bully, and makes the viewer understand how hard it is to stand up and change the status quo.Bully is told from the point of view of the teens involved in the group murder of Marty's tormentor.  The question of ultimate responsibility for the crime is answered only in the court sentences, not by the filmmaker.  This is a great discussion piece--does bullying invite crimes of self-defense?  Was Lisa Connelly the ringleader or did Marty grow a backbone?  Was Marty manipulated by yet another bully, Lisa, when he went along with her plan?  Did an atmosphere of money, drugs, and plenty of free time create the perfect storm for a mob-mentality murder?  How much do absent parents play into a tragedy of this proportion?Larry Clark has no simple Hollywood answer to any of these questions.  Therein lies the beauty of this film.",5,"When you give up and murder your tormentor, how should you be punished?",1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,2045,"['Bully', 'based', 'true', 'high', 'school', 'crime', 'took', 'place', 'Cooper', 'City', 'Florida', 'Boyhood', 'Marty', 'Puccio', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'Bobby', 'Kent', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'traveled', 'same', 'circles', 'casual', 'drug', 'use', 'loose', 'women', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'rarely', 'attended', 'high', 'school', 'classes', 'Bobby', 'bullied', 'Marty', 'entire', 'lives', 'raped', 'Marty', 'girl', 'friends', 'pulled', 'aggressive', 'stunts', 'such', 'capturing', 'local', 'drifter', 'forcing', 'perform', 'homosexual', 'acts', 'camera', 'Director', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'gripping', 'portrait', 'bullying', 'submission', 'how', 'hard', 'stand', 'up', 'bully', 'when', 'been', 'power', 'good', 'sixteen', 'more', 'high', 'school', 'sexual', 'acts', 'drug', 'use', 'film', 'will', 'inevitably', 'be', 'compared', 'Clark', 'earlier', 'work', 'Kids', 'Bully', 'however', 'based', 'true', 'crime', 'copious', 'court', 'records', 'confessions', 'witness', 'statements', 'non-fiction', 'book', 'subjects', 'reviewer', 'who', 'plausibility', 'film', 'look', 'further', 'Martin', 'Puccio', 'vs.', 'State', 'Florida', 'Appellee', 'No', '86,242', 'November', '20', '1997', 'Clark', 'facts', 'case', 'movie', 'fear', 'loathing', 'someone', 'who', 'bully', 'viewer', 'understand', 'how', 'hard', 'stand', 'up', 'change', 'status', 'quo.Bully', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'teens', 'involved', 'group', 'murder', 'Marty', 'tormentor', 'question', 'ultimate', 'responsibility', 'crime', 'answered', 'only', 'court', 'sentences', 'not', 'filmmaker', 'great', 'discussion', 'piece', 'bullying', 'invite', 'crimes', 'self-defense', 'Was', 'Lisa', 'Connelly', 'ringleader', 'did', 'Marty', 'grow', 'backbone', 'Was', 'Marty', 'manipulated', 'yet', 'bully', 'Lisa', 'when', 'went', 'along', 'plan', 'Did', 'atmosphere', 'money', 'drugs', 'plenty', 'free', 'time', 'create', 'perfect', 'storm', 'mob-mentality', 'murder', 'How', 'much', 'do', 'absent', 'parents', 'play', 'tragedy', 'proportion', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'simple', 'Hollywood', 'answer', 'questions', 'Therein', 'beauty', 'film']",N/A

Larry Clark returns to his fascination with the naked, hairless, prepubescent male torso many times, and extensive full nude scenes feature Rachel Minor as Lisa and Bijou Phillips as Ali.  Clark&#65533;s camera crawls all over the young actresses&#65533; bodies like the eyes of a leering pervert.  ...While there are no underdogs to cheer for in Bully, to his acting credit you almost root for Nick Stahl as Bobby until he opens his mouth again or punches somebody.

One might go as far as to say it isn't really for the strong of heart, either.  The ovie's protrayal of teenage angst gone horribly wrong is brutal, frank, frightening, and unsettling.This film centers around a real-life situation where one boy bullied another for years while proclaiming to be his friend.  The bully's parents seem to be totally out of touch with their son.  In fact all the parents in this film are depicted as out of touch, whether by choice or because their kids live completely outside of parental authority is not really clear, but the parents definitely have no clue what is happening in their kids' lives.So to combat the bullying, the victim's girlfriend conceives a plot to kill the perpetrator.  How this plot unfolds gives insight into how shallow kids think.  The girl at least decided not to use her mom's handgun because it would be too easy for investigators to figure out what happened, but the final choice on how to kill is equally weak and shallow.  But they go through with the murder without first having thought of any kind of alibi.  Then after the killing the kids all begin to talk with associates who were not part of the conspiracy.The film iteslf is strong during the build-up, the plotting, and during the murder.  It is very weak in the aftermath.  It show police detectives arriving at one of the kids' houses, but after that we just see the group in prison uniforms in a courtroom.  Nothing is done to set up the trial or even the indictments.  Perhaps if the film hadn't wasted time on the sex and drug scenes it would have had more time for more pertinent story lines.I can't really recommend this film to anyone.

In other words, they are like so many American kids we are too frightened to admit our parents and society have produced. So don't blame Clark if you are uncomfortable with the way these teens are portrayed.The real notable performances in this film are from Rachel Miner, Brad Renfro (in a wonderfully understated and subdued performance as the primary victim of bullying by Bobby, his ""best friend""), and the wonderful Nick Stahl.If you saw ""In The Bedroom"", you saw Stahl in a great performance as a gentle, loving, romantic, and lovable lead.

It's not often that movies hit me in the gut and leave me stunned,.but i can't explain this film any other way, than to say it is sheer genius.  Larry Clark has the style of a true master film maker. The performances from this young cast are simply brilliant. He is a director who lets the camera focus on the eyes of the actors, so you feel what they feel. His camera lingers (imperceptibly) for a fraction of a second longer than is comfortable. His visual style is unique, his choice of music inspired, and most of all the acting is just out of this world. I've seen some of these actors since in movies that are quite average, so it leads me to believe it really is the director who elicits the performances from them. Larry Clark is a master film maker, albeit a pervert, however, I recall Roger Ebert saying ""if a 25 year old made this film it would be considered cutting edge and a brilliant look into the world of troubled adolescents"" or words to that effect.

Based on a true story I was taken in by the whole thing instantly. The story was a great basis for an even greater movie. Larry Clarks choice of actors was perfect. Bijou Phillips as the care free, experimental Ali was just right. Nich Stahl as the Bully, played it with such truthfulness, that in certain scenes was disturbing to see. Brad Renfro as Marty - the initial victim of Bobby's violence. Plays it with a perfect sense of fear but of also the need to rebel against him and eventually stop running.In typical Larry style the movie uses very unusual camera angles to make things as real to life as possible. Larry Clark also likes to shock and have an impact on his viewers - small elements like the umbearable camera spinning round a group of teens for well over 1 minute made me turn away dizzy, also using an unwanted shot of Bijou's crotch, it served no purpose.The movie is very real, Larry hasn't left any stone unturned. High amounts of ...frolics between the teens and even the murder itself are as real and are played with as much truth as possible.I watched the first 10 minutes and I had to turn it off - because I was brought face to face with a grim reality - that was done in such a believable way that I had to register what I had seen. It was quite shocking to see some of the actors as their characters. For example Michael Pitt went from innocent and loving Henry in Dawsons Creek to a guy who has lots ...[of relations] and would commit ...[crimes] As uncomfortable as the scenes were, the acting was at such a high level you'd never know they were phased by it.Although Bully is initailly a grim story of ...[crimes], I think Bully is on some level a fun, entertaining teenage flick, its the violent elements in the story that change the whole feel to it.Bully has fresh new talent and a kicking soundtrack. Larry Clark has always been interested in youth..., in this movie he has combined that and applied it to a gripping story.Bully has been a real eye opener.

This frustrates Lisa as she feels helpless and she discusses with Marty that he needs to do something about the situation, which leads the two of them into a plan of killing Bobby.

It's a shame his performance was largely overlooked. This film is definitely not for everyone. It's one of those movies you either love or hate.

683063,AXLW246TETRY1,B00005U14H,Lunchbox,"[2, 2]","I highly hesitate to say this film represents reality so well...in my opinion, it really does (even though I'll have to bring some nuances on that point), but I would not recommend this to paranoiac parents...okay, this is a Larry Clark film, he made KIDS, and this looks like KIDS a lot. For parents out there, watching this, don't freak out, there are some cases like these children's, but Clark exaggerated the thing a bit, especially when the parents of the kids appear and the kids look okay...they're high or drunk all the time, but when they're talking to their parents, it's like they forgot that their characters were high...anyways, that's a negative point of the movie, but they are rare. The film is truly disgusting to watch, (Spoilers, but I would qualify the following as the offensive material for some viewers) teenagers dressing like prostitutes and having sex with multiple partners, while being high or drinking are always on screen. There is some plenty of drug use and detailed reactions. I'll have to say that the film reminded me some old bad trips or nights being sick because of substance/alcohol use. This movie will touch you even more if you have a past that makes a certain parallel with the character's lives. The film criticizes today's youth, showing 8 year old boys drinking beer, teenagers killing someone, boys raping girls, among so much more stuff ""you wouldn't want your children to be involved in""...but still, sincere congratulations to Mr.Clark, who wasn't afraid to show what was needed to give his message. The realistic aspect of the film makes it so disturbing, and pretty hard as well as easy to watch. The sexuality is disturbing, so realistic, the drug abuse too, and, of course, the murder too. It really demonstrates how it should feel like for first-time (and young) murderers. The directing had something very special, especially at one particular part of the movie, when five or six teens are talking about murdering a friend, and they're all high, and the camera turns around them while they're speaking, and it's important for the story to listen to the dialogue of that scene, but the camera makes you feel high by turning repeatedly around the actors. The main problem of the film (the biggest, which is, in this film, not so important) is the SOOO short time spent on the idea of killing the ""bully""...their idea seems so stupid, and some of the murderers don't even know him yet in the story, and already hate him, it seems almost like Clark had forgot to introduce the story, because of the long amount of time spent on showing how messed up the characters are, and he just had to rush for the story introduction. But ""Bully"" delivers more than we expect. It's realistic, but here's an important nuance to make; it's not all the teenagers that are like this, so, parents, don't worry, this is some of the worse cases you could imagine...but the murder idea in the film has nothing very realistic, seriously, for the beer and drugs, okay, for the sexuality, well that's a little forward (at least usually), but for the idea of killing someone...nah, even though the murder sequence is rendered wonderfully, its basis is exaggerated. I don't know how this movie could be released with only an R rating (it really deserves an NC-17!). Oh yeah, by the way, the ending is a good conclusion and interesting. Overall, this movie is a great one, really, it's raw, powerful, but exaggerated a bit...Excellent actors, except for Mrs.Bijou Phillips...Heavy advisory, this contains graphic, realistic sexuality, violence and gore, substance abuse, and pervasive strong language. This is NC-17 stuff, that's obvious...anyways, I give ""Bully"" a 8/10.

It shakes you hard and once it gets its grasp on you, it never lets go until it's all said and done.  It's also a movie that is guaranteed to stay in your head for days, no matter how hard you try to forget it.  This is a chilling and powerful film, and one of the darkest movies I have seen this year so far.Based on a true story, ""Bully"" is about a guy named Marty, who is always getting beaten up and tormented by his best friend Bobby.  Bobby's one nasty and mean character who does what he wants when he wants.  He's been known to be sexually abusive towards women and unleashes his violent temper upon anyone who gets in his way.  Not being able to take it anymore, Marty and his girlfriend decide maybe it's time that something should be done.  They get together with a group of friends and decide they have to kill Bobby  What seems to be a simple plan falls apart right before their eyes, and once the deed is done they can never go back to the way things were.This film is directed by the same man who did ""Kids,"" Larry Clark.  He does a superb job of orchestrating this brutally chilling force of a movie that knocks the air right out of your body.  The cast and crew were also great.  Every actor did their roles justice.  Especially the man who plays Marty.  As I was watching this, I kept asking to myself ""This is a true story??"" in complete disbelief.Be warned, this is a VERY uneasy film to watch.  Not a second goes by in where there isn't something shocking going on.  This is another one of those movies that isn't meant for everybody, but I still think it's an important film.  Bullying is a very serious subject that plagues the world every day.  This movie reveals the true ugliness of that and shows just how far some will go to stop it.The DVD doesn't have very much to offer, other than a couple of interviews, a music-only audio option, and a trailer.  The picture and sound is really good, considering how low of a budget this movie was made on.""Bully"" is a success in my eyes, as hard as it was to watch.

The characters' lives revolve around violent video games, illegal drugs, and exploitative sex. Amoral and disconnected from parents and community, these kids are like a cluster of human time bombs.The film features superb performances from its talented young cast; at times ""Bully"" feels like a gritty documentary. After seeing Stahl portray a rather nice character in ""In the Bedroom,"" I was both shocked and impressed by his portrayal of the sociopathic youth in ""Bully."" And fans of the talented Renfro will be again rewarded; he brings a palpable pain and fury to this flawed, but strangely sympathetic character.The graphic sex, homoeroticism, and violence of ""Bully"" will probably be too much for many viewers to take. But if you endure this disturbing film, you will see a compelling vision of fear, paranoia, and a desparate need for love and acceptance.",5,"A disturbing, powerful film",1022630400,"05 29, 2002",2002,1309,"['Larry', 'Clark', 'film', 'Bully', 'dysfunctional', 'group', 'Florida', 'teens', 'lives', 'take', 'turn', 'towards', 'horrific', 'tragedy', 'Central', 'story', 'relationship', 'Marty', 'played', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'Bobby', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'who', 'work', 'together', 'sandwich', 'shop', 'Bobby', 'physically', 'verbally', 'brutalizes', 'Marty', 'thus', 'laying', 'groundwork', 'tragedy', 'Bully', 'frightening', 'portrayal', 'nihilistic', 'adolescent', 'wasteland', 'characters', 'lives', 'revolve', 'violent', 'video', 'games', 'illegal', 'drugs', 'exploitative', 'sex', 'Amoral', 'disconnected', 'parents', 'community', 'kids', 'are', 'cluster', 'human', 'time', 'bombs.The', 'film', 'features', 'superb', 'performances', 'talented', 'young', 'cast', 'times', 'Bully', 'feels', 'gritty', 'documentary', 'seeing', 'Stahl', 'portray', 'rather', 'nice', 'character', 'Bedroom', 'was', 'shocked', 'impressed', 'portrayal', 'sociopathic', 'youth', 'Bully', 'fans', 'talented', 'Renfro', 'will', 'be', 'again', 'rewarded', 'palpable', 'pain', 'fury', 'flawed', 'strangely', 'sympathetic', 'character.The', 'graphic', 'sex', 'homoeroticism', 'violence', 'Bully', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'many', 'viewers', 'take', 'endure', 'disturbing', 'film', 'will', 'see', 'compelling', 'vision', 'fear', 'paranoia', 'desparate', 'need', 'love', 'acceptance']",N/A

Being a film loving-diva myself I found Bully at times repulsive, definitely disgusting and vulgar...but you know what?  That's exactly what it was supposed to be(...). I am speaking of the character in the film and not the real person. You have to be careful when you review this film and talk about the characters because these were real people and this murder really happened. I read the book and can understand why Larry Clark changed things and omitted facts. Who can do a tragedy like this justice in only a few hours? But, that's all the studio was willing to give Clark. He uses his two hours to tame the audience and bring them into a world a lot of parents are afraid to go to.  Why, because many of their so-called perfect children are already living in that world and they can't stand to admit it. Clark is always criticized for putting teens in awkward positions ( no pun intended ) but the actors were all of age and he reflected the movie from his perception of Bobby Kent's real murder.This is a good film. A film anyone over twenty-one should see. A film that will open your eyes and even at times have you thinking murder is right. Finally, it's not until you see the culprits all polished up in their prisoner suits that you realize you shouldn't feel sorry for either one of them. Murder is murder and not even an abused sole such as the pathetic Marty Puccio ( I'm speaking of the film's character, not the person ) should be allowed to solve his own battles by bloodshed. Many people don't like these kinds of films. Why? Because it shows them that kids are bad in every place and time. It doesn't matter what neighborhoods you come from or how much money you have or what race you are, kids are going to be kids and sometimes kids are just plain murderers.(...). Clark threw in so much Bully starts to look like a 90210 epiosode crossed with a cheesy porn flick. (...) I'm guessing Bobby's abusive nature came from the super-obsessive hold his father had over him. What got me was how come Rachel Miner played Lisa when anyone who knows the story and book knows Lisa was a large young lady. So why didn't they get a full-figured actress? Come on, Hollywood the big ladies are sick of being ignored. Another thing were name changes of some of the minor characters for what reason...I don't know. This film educates to a point but be careful because it can brainwash you into thinking murder's the way to go. That's when you hose off and realize, these kids were high, bored and being abused.  Still at the end of the movie what they did was wrong. It was very wrong. But if you're interested in true-life crimes brought to the big screen you will enjoy going along for the ride.

683083,A363QRXP83K8ZE,B00005U14H,"N. P. Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[21, 22]","This film is still rating 5 stars because of the sheer fact that I couldn't turn if off when I first happened upon it late at night.  It was one of those movies that made you think about the rest of the country and about the people next door.Bully is based on the Jim Schutze novel/true crime account of the 1993 murder of Bobby Kent, a teenage ""bully"" who pushed a group of kids into killing him.  Sort of.  Only some of the characters responsible for Bobby's death don't even know who is he.  They are the hangers-on of the main players, a sad, white suburban teen couple.  These two are played perfectly by Brad Renfro (who, in staying in character as a complete doofus, was arrested for various hijinks during production) and Rachel Miner.  Yes, Rachel-ex-wife-of-Macauley Culkin-Miner who prances nude in half the film.  They're bound by a pregnancy and a familiar sense of going nowehere, he a has-been surfer dude at 19 and she a never-will-be dreamer.Uh, anyway, a good portion of the film is spent on displaying Bobby's behavior, which is the resume for his murder.  Nick Stahl is intense as Bobby, even though the real life Bobby Kent was a steroid-bulging, wanna be gang member son of Iranian immigrants, an ethnicity angle strangely omitted.  Also omitted to a great extent is the gang angle of the real life case.  It doesn't end up mattering because ultimately Stahl plays Bobby as a borderline psycho teen.  To his parents he's a decent student, ambitious, a nice young man with a future ahead in college.But in reality he's a raging lunatic.  I mean, honestly, as much as it's surprising to see young suburban kids suddenly committ a brutal member, how many friends have you ever had like Bobby Kent?  Teenage boys can be cruel to each other, but how many of your friends regularly punch you in the face, perform 3 Stooges-like slaps to your head at any moment, oh, and rape your girlfriend.The saddest, and greatest part about this film is that the case was true.  However, keep in mind a key element of the film: nearly all of the dialogue is taken right from the Jim Schutze novel WORD FOR WORD.  Bully, the book, was something between a novel and true crime account that was very dialogue-oriented and wound up giving the film some of its best lines.  Larry Clark didn't have to touch the lines up too much.  But the staging is excellent.  This is an almost pornographic account of the events yet it seems appropriate anyway since Clark is simply telling a TRUE story that was very gritty, very ugly.Let's face it.

I thought the second half was totally unrealistic and stupid. I thought nobody is as stupid as these kids. But I guess I was wrong. The movie starts out with two friends. One of them is a bully to the other. The movie suggests that there is something more going on between them. The bully sets the other guy up to strip in a gay bar and have phone sex with other guys. They also make gay films and sell them to make money. The bully seems to enjoy the gay stuff a lot more than the other friend. Well, they meet these two girls. The friend falls in love with one of them but she doesn't like the way the bully treats him. The bully likes to hit him and he also rapes girls. So she persuades the friend to kill the bully and she gathers all these other people to help out. So now there's this big group of people and they all gang up on the bully and kill him. The way they over up the crime is pathetic and they all but hang a sign from their necks saying ""I'm a murderer."" The movie starts out as a serious drama but as soon as murder comes into it, it turns into a dark comedy. The bully, who you would think is the villain, turns out the be the person you feel sorry for and the other people are the real villains. They're all losers who have no plans for life and do nothing but smoke and plan a murder. The bully may be a jerk but he respects his father, he has a job, he plans to go to college, and deep down he does care for his best friend.

It's better than the critically acclaimed 'Kids', and better than Clark's more controversial and highly banned movie 'Ken Park'. Some people don't know what to make or Larry Clark. it seems that he has an almost fetishistic entrancement with teenagers. His films break a lot of taboo's because they include teenage nudity and explicit sex scenes involving children and teenagers. Ken Park in fact was reported to have included actual sex rather than simulated sex involving teenagers in Ken Park. Some may condemm the frankness of Clark's movies, because they often exploit teenagers in rather morally unnacceptable ways, but one thing can't be denied, Clark has a vibe for teenagers and knows how to present them in very sobering and realistic ways. In the case of this film some people felt that the teens featured here appealed as very dumb and moronic, but the reality is that many teens are in fact this morally inept and lost. And yes, many are capable of doing the very things the kids in this film did. Add drugs into the mix like LSD and the lines between fiction and reality can get blurred, and some teens can be led to commit terrible crimes in the very same way these teens murder one of their own friends. The fact is the victim here was a very hateful and dispicable person, who raped and abused girls, beat up his best friend and continually humiliated him from the time they were very young children. This film shows unflinchingly how troubled teens can end up commiting murder, and it's totally riveting. This film is an exceptional masterpiece about a very ugly subject. And it's a sobering lesson for the young. It's too bad this film is filled with very explicit sex scenes involving teens, which many children would never be allowed to see, because it's so effective that the lessons it has to teach could help other troubled teens before they make the same terible mistakes.",4,"Stark, haunting, graphic, disturbing, realistic and honest film making",1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,1950,"['film', 'opinion', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'best', 'movie', 'better', 'critically', 'acclaimed', ""'Kids"", 'better', 'Clark', 'more', 'controversial', 'highly', 'banned', 'movie', 'Park', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'almost', 'fetishistic', 'entrancement', 'teenagers', 'films', 'break', 'lot', 'taboo', 'include', 'teenage', 'nudity', 'explicit', 'sex', 'scenes', 'involving', 'children', 'teenagers', 'Ken', 'Park', 'fact', 'was', 'reported', 'have', 'included', 'actual', 'sex', 'rather', 'simulated', 'sex', 'involving', 'teenagers', 'Ken', 'Park', 'may', 'condemm', 'frankness', 'Clark', 'movies', 'often', 'exploit', 'teenagers', 'rather', 'morally', 'unnacceptable', 'ways', 'one', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'denied', 'Clark', 'vibe', 'teenagers', 'how', 'present', 'very', 'sobering', 'realistic', 'ways', 'case', 'film', 'people', 'felt', 'teens', 'featured', 'here', 'appealed', 'very', 'dumb', 'moronic', 'reality', 'many', 'teens', 'are', 'fact', 'morally', 'inept', 'lost', 'yes', 'many', 'are', 'capable', 'doing', 'very', 'things', 'kids', 'film', 'did', 'Add', 'drugs', 'mix', 'LSD', 'lines', 'fiction', 'reality', 'can', 'get', 'blurred', 'teens', 'can', 'be', 'led', 'commit', 'terrible', 'crimes', 'very', 'same', 'way', 'teens', 'murder', 'one', 'own', 'friends', 'fact', 'victim', 'here', 'was', 'very', 'hateful', 'dispicable', 'person', 'who', 'raped', 'abused', 'girls', 'beat', 'up', 'best', 'friend', 'continually', 'humiliated', 'time', 'were', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'film', 'unflinchingly', 'how', 'troubled', 'teens', 'can', 'end', 'up', 'commiting', 'murder', 'totally', 'riveting', 'film', 'exceptional', 'masterpiece', 'very', 'ugly', 'subject', 'sobering', 'lesson', 'young', 'too', 'bad', 'film', 'filled', 'very', 'explicit', 'sex', 'scenes', 'involving', 'teens', 'many', 'children', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'allowed', 'see', 'so', 'effective', 'lessons', 'teach', 'could', 'help', 'other', 'troubled', 'teens', 'make', 'same', 'terible', 'mistakes']",N/A

For those that cannot believe that today's teenagers, who have had more given to them material wise & opportunity wise, can possibly be so stupid as to commit such a crime I can only say try talking to a group of them sometime. A kid next door who was given everything to him on a silver platter couldn't even tell me why the United States finally declared war on Japan back in the 1940's.... hint it was world war 2 and they bombed our base at Pearl Harbor. But, the kid sure knew how to bum money from his mom, go on line to pirate music & how to score some ecstasy. He was really proud of the last one. This movie is as accurate as it gets showing the teenage mind set on screen and depicts the level of complete lack of moral judgement that too many of them have achieved.

It is an intense and reality shocker of a film.

683091,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005U14H,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 5]","Bully (Larry Clark, 2001)I have no doubt that it's entirely coincidental that Brad Renfro died under mysterious circumstances two days after I finally got around to watching Bully, one of his final male-lead performances. Still, it's just plain weird.First off, kudos to Larry Clark for making a movie that doesn't require subtitles. Even Leo Fitzpatrick, one of the actors who made Kids such an unwatchable mess, has managed to learn to enunciate. Bravo! That said, all the rest of the stuff that caused me to dislike Kids is still here, albeit mostly muted. The one thing that still stands way, way out is Clark's consistent need to dump any subtlety in order to go for the shock value shot. (I mean, come on. The opening scene, fergossake.) It's not as if the story doesn't have more than enough shock value on its own-- a bully, Bobby Kent (Terminator 3's Nick Stahl), finally pushes those around him over the edge, and they plot to kill him. Renfro plays Kent's best friend, Marty Puccio, the one most manipulated by Bobby-- in the first ten minutes of the film, Bobby prods Marty to dance in a gay bar's teen amateur night, sets him up for paid phone sex, beats him severely, and then says ""come on, Marty, you're my best friend."" It's classic emotional abuse, and Stahl is a good enough actor to pull it off. The whole beginning of the film is Hollywood-emotional-shortcut city, but there's enough depth and emotion to Stahl's performance that it doesn't feel like the audience, at least, is being manipulated as much as Marty is. Things change for the two of them when Marty meets Lisa Connelly (Californication's Rachel Miner), and the two of them begin a relationship; Marty is seemingly less tolerant of Bobby's shenanigans, and Lisa just flat-out doesn't like him (though her best friend Ali [Bijou Phillips] is intrigued by Bobby). After a series of events that shows both Lisa and Ali just how nasty Bobby can be, Lisa, Ali, and Marty, along with a few of Ali's friends, decide to take matters into their own hands.The movie, which is based on a true case (chronicled in Jim Schutze's book of the same name), raises one extremely important question: is there ever anyone who truly deserves to die, someone whom the world would be better off without? I think to some extent that how you answer that question will determine how you ultimately feel about this movie. Even so, however, if you believe (as I do) that the answer to that question is a resounding and unqualified ""yes"", there are still some technical details of the movie that may keep you from fully enjoying it. The sound editing ranges from barely competent to painfully bad. Clark's directorial style has always struck me as amateur, though I do realize that might be an affectation on his part (some sort of cinema verite approach, perhaps). The acting ranges from the very good (Renfro) to the ""what are you doing here?"" (Daniel Franzese, who redeemed himself and more in Mean Girls). It is, of course, possible that all this will be eclipsed, in your mind, by the fact that very few of these actors wear more than the bare minimum of clothing at any given time, and often a great deal less than that; Miner, in particular, seems to have some sort of allergy to clothing in this movie. Not that I'm complaining, mind you.

There's more than an inference of repressed homosexuality and rage in their relationship and a mountain of self-loathing pressing down on Stahl's Bobby.Director Larry Clark (""Kids"") delivers a shocker that is blatantly voyeuristic, repugnant and unflinching as we hang out and become intimate with these seemingly ordinary, seriously neglected and certainly unhinged teens. When Marty gets (has sex with) new girlfriend Lisa (Rachel Miner), Bobby turns his abuse toward her and her best friend Ally (Bijou Phillips).  Annoyed, Lisa coldly and calculatingly hatches a plan to get Marty out of the picture once and for all. And everyone kind of agrees and goes along with the plan.  And what's even worse, to a certain degree, so do we.  We sure aren't rooting for Bobby because we see him as evil. Almost possessed.It's easy to assume that these things only happen to other people's kids in other neighborhoods. In this secret teen world in which we are privy, totally out of touch parents make ritualistic small talk to their stoned kids while the kids stash guns and knives and calmly announce they are going to a movie. This is not a tongue in cheek foray into farce violence morality a la Oliver Stone's ""Natural Born Killers"" but an almost documentary-like, in-your-face slice of time and life of these kids' lives on the fringe.  A fringe that is ever encroaching on our seemingly secure suburban world. Larry Clark's examination of this dark milieu is uncompromising and it is also art.

But just because a movie has heavy amounts of violence/sex/drugs doesn't, by any means, make it good.  The real winning trait about the film is the interesting teen character study it provides for the viewer.  Most all off these kids weren't killers, and only a few knew the victim personally.  So why did they kill?  As the subtitle of the novel about the story asks, 'Does anyone (even the worst of bullys) deserve to die?Lisa Connolly is pretty much your average teen droppout.  She lives at home with Mom and frequents the beach for lack of anything else to do.  Marty Puccio is a surfer, and, like Lisa, a high school droppout.  The two meet, and this leads to an almost-instant relationship.  But things aren't perfect by far, and though Lisa falls 'in love' with Marty, there's always his best friend, Bobby, to deal with.  Bobby seems to get off on tormenting Marty with violent pranks and a few punches, which Lisa soon becomes alarmingly aware of.  Then, when Bobby rapes her best friend, Ali, Lisa begins to plot murder with Bobby.  After moments of hesitation and jokes, the two, along with a motley crew of other teens, (mostly droppouts and one so-called ' mafia hitman') decide that Bobby's  gotta go.  And the teens serously start plotting Bobbys death.Whoaw!  A reviewer actually said the film lacked worthy acting!  I never would've guessed.  Rachel Miner, Nick Stahl, and Bijou Phillips, all showed decent range in the film, and were certainly not 'awful'.  Indie awards really overlooked (or missed it altogether) Bully.  It really is a shame.Larry Clark, who shocked the world with 1995's Kids, succedes again in shocking his audience.

They go to the same high school that your kids go to.  They don't mean any harm, they just want to have a good time.This is exactly how you would see them if you were wearing rose-colored glasses.  The reality is that these kids were spoiled dropouts, druggies, and didn't work most of the time.Bobby Kent (Nick Stahl) is cruising through life, waiting for daddy to set him up with his own business, but not wanting work to interfere with his playtime.  Bobby is a bully, he is verbally and physically abusive even to his best friend Marty Puccio (Brad Renfro).  And if Bobby wants to have sex with a girl, he will have it by force if necessary.The movie starts where Lisa Connolly (Rachel Miner) and her best friend Ali Willis (Bijou Phillips) meet Marty and Bobby at a deli.  They meet later at North Beach and even later have sex, and Lisa falls head over heels in love with Marty.  The only thing that bothers Lisa is Bobby.  She doesn't like the way Bobby rules Marty's life, or the way he treats her.After Lisa tells Marty she is pregnant and Marty blows up at her, Lisa decides that it is all Bobby's fault.  She believes the world would be perfect for her and Marty as long as Bobby wasn't in it.  It's not hard for Lisa to get Ali on her side, especially after Bobby raped Ali, but the murder job she has planned will involve more people.Ali brings in her new boyfriend, Donny Semenec (expertly played by the talented Michael Pitt) and her close friend Heather Swallers (Kelli Garner).  Lisa enlists the aid of her cousin Derek (Daniel Franzese) and another local boy known as The Hitman (Leo Fitzpatrick).The gang invites Bobby out to a deserted area along one of Florida's many canals, using the promise of sex and drugs to lure him in, but instead they murder him in cold blood.Bully is based on a true story, and really surprised me at how well it came out.  I urge you to watch it closely, because there is a great deal of sex in the movie that can be rather distracting.  At first, I thought it was like a Calvin Klein underwear commercial, there was so much teen nudity and sexual situations, even those flashing buffalo-shots of panties, shorts, packages, and whatnot.  But then the message sunk in; this was the way these kids treated sex!  Casual, no-big-deal, something-to-do, more like having a cigarette than sharing intimacy.At first viewing I thought the beginning to be a bit slow, mostly because of the many sexual scenes, but the portrayal of these kid's deviant behavior is important to the set up of their overall mentality.  So kick back and relax, and keep watching.  It definitely gets better.It struck me how little regard these girls held for themselves and their bodies, social acceptance based on sexuality, breeding like cats in an alley, and treating pregnancy as if it were of no consequence.  It's no wonder to me that they were capable of murder.The acting is really quite good in Bully, but its plain that Michael Pitt is far above the rest.  You will swear that he really took dope to play his character, even pulling down a few laughs from me, especially with the clothespins.Overall, Bully is a great movie.  The mood is captured well, the photography good, the acting good, and the script definitely well written.  If you are shy of nudity or a bit of violence, you may want to cover your eyes a bit.

683096,A2BLRRNYU9XO9R,B00005U14H,S. Coleman,"[7, 8]","Lisa Connelly had always been an insecure teenager. Thinking herself overweight and unattractive, she loved to spend her afternoons lying naked on her bed, staring up at the glistening photos of scantily clad men on her wall and dreaming of the day when she would have a ""hunk"" of her own. The positive inspiration in life was her friend Alli, who told her that she just needed ""attitude"" if she wanted a man, that she only had to get out on the beach and ""work for it."" One afternoon while visiting the grocery store deli with Alli, Lisa finds herself unable to speak. Behind the counter preparing sandwiches are two of the biggest hunks she has ever seen. Alli, far more experienced and unimpressed, boldly calls out to the boys, dissing them for not wearing cellophane gloves because she does not know where their hands have been. After making suggestive comments as to where their hands have explored and jauntily introducing themselves ,Bobby Kent and Marty Puccio invite the girls to watch them surf later that day. Though Alli promises to think about it, Lisa swears that the boys are making fun of her. ""They're just being a--holes, Lisa,"" Alli assures her, ""Guys are like that."" But after joining Marty and Bobby at North Beach later that evening, Lisa finds herself falling for Marty's shy exterior. The two begin an intense sexual relationship, and it does not take long to see that Bobby's friendship with Marty extends far beyond the boundaries of typical male camaraderie. Bobby thrives on physically abusing Marty without reason, severely bloodying his nose in one scene and twisting his ear until it is red and smarting in another. He makes Marty accompany him to gay clubs and dance before the crowd, after which he demands any money that Marty earns from such degrading performances. Though Marty protests to the abuse, Bobby's mantra of ""You know you're my best friend, right?"" always keeps him coming back for more. Predictably, Bobby's possessive nature spills over into Marty and Lisa's relationship, and he begins turning his violence on her as well. One of the most harrowing scenes of the film involves Bobby walking into the room as Marty and Lisa are having sex, whipping Lisa with a belt, and knocking Marty out cold so that he can take his ""turn"" with his best friend's girl. He also viciously rapes Alli while forcing her to watch a homemade gay porn tape--with Lisa and Marty sitting in the next room, totally unaware. After a couple of months, Lisa can no longer stand Bobby's abusive ways. Not only is she tired of being beaten herself, but she is sick of watching her boyfriend cower like a dog in the presence of his master. If only Bobby would just disappear, everyone's problems would be solved. She and Marty meet at the beach one day, and it is decided that Bobby Kent must die. Lisa calls Alli back at her home in Palm Bay, and Alli agrees to help out, bringing her stoner friends Heather and Donny along for the ride. With Lisa's cousin Derek and a ""hitman"" that they hire to bring a more professional flair to their plan, the seven murderous young people set out to end Bobby's life. One summer night at the beach, their plot is successful, and the events that follow will transform them from a group of aimless suburban misfits to the defendants of one of the most shocking murder trials in American history.Based on the 1993 murder of Bobby Kent in Hollywood, Florida, Larry Clark's Bully is not for the faint of heart. In the tradition of his 1995 film Kids, Clark makes no attempt to sugarcoat the daily lives of heedless youth gone bad. Graphic scenes of sex, drugs, violence, and full on nudity--all set to a soundtrack of hardcore gangster rap--add to this tale of South Florida in the eyes of a decadent teenager. The gritty scenes of teens screaming out for help through all of their actions--whether they be having sex, getting high, or beating each other up--cause the audience to want to turn away, but also hold on tightly to the kids to keep them from slipping away. The standout performance of the film goes to Nick Stahl (Disturbing Behavior), who manages to play Bobby Kent with such an intolerable cruelty that you almost cannot wait to see him killed, yet as he is dying on the beach, you feel enough sympathy for his character to want to reach out and defend him. Late child actor Brad Renfro (The Client) is superb as the abused Marty Puccio, and indie favorite Michael Pitt (Last Days, Funny Games) succeeds in stealing every scene in which he appears and adding a hint of comic relief as Alli's drug-addled flavor-of the-week and co-conspirator Donny Semenec. I recommend Bully for anyone who loves a good true crime case or a story of reckless youth. After watching this film, all age groups will experience a change in how they live their lives. Not only will teenagers pay more attention to whom they choose as their friends, but parents will likely take a more intrusive role in the lives of their children to prevent such a horrific tragedy from playing out within their own families.

683097,A1WFEHAV42HTM5,B00005U14H,Scrimshaw,"[2, 3]","Bully is a 2001 independent drama film directed by Larry Clark, who also directed the controversial 1995 film Kids. Bully is very similar to Kids, despite the fact that Kids is a fictional film while Bully is based on a real life murder that took place in Florida back in the early 90's. Bully stars Brad Renfro, Bijou Phillips, Rachel Miner, Michael Pitt, Leo Fitzpatrick, and Nick Stahl as the titular ""Bully"". This film is bleak, dark, and depressing and I didn't like any of the characters, neither the Bully, nor the supposed ""victim"" played by Brad Renfro. Because I didn't like any of the characters, I could really care less about the main plot, which consisted of a bunch of the victim's friends and acquaintances coming up with and following through with a plan to kill the bully. With I focused on more was the disgusting, immoral behavior of the characters. All the characters seemed to do was do drugs, have sex, curse, and then have more sex, which was in no way erotic or stimulating. Honestly, I wouldn't have minded if the rest of the characters died as well, that's how much this movie sucked, also the director seemingly tried to be as vulgar and shocking as possible, and I have no respect for people like that. It's a wonder that people like him even become directors in the first place. Based on the little info I know on him, he should be living in a trailer park or small apartment in the city working some blue-collar job to support his trashy family. The only thing that prevents the film from a one star rating is the fact that I have been bullied alot growing up and I like a film where a victim gets revenge against a bully, not this particular victim, of course, but the notion or ""theme"".

The endless and seemingly pointless drug scenes and sex scenes, the obsession with disgusting details, all the incoherent conversations, and plus the nauseating cinematography make this movie disturbing. One can easily accuse Larry Clark for been crazy himself.However, the movie is not suppose to be a fun family flick; this movie is a search into why things happened the way they happened.Why would someone kill his best friend? Why did a whole bunch other high-school dropouts help someone who they just met kill someone who they did not even know? Was it hatred, was it boredom, or was it inherent frustration with a society that offered no opportunities to its young?The movie, through retracing this needless episode of human tragedy affirms that nothing happens just by itself--every human action is tied to every other human action even if thousands of miles away. So how could we simply put to death the 18 year-olds without questioning what in the world has so mislead them or has so left them in their stupid innocence? So who really was responsible for the crime they committed? As the movie showed, nobody believed he/she killed, but they all did, and does this ""they"" not include others in our world too.The movie gives no explicit explanations for exactly what caused what, because that would be impossible to figure out in our vast world with a thousand different faces. The movie did offer many traces of causes that stay in the audience's head as reminders for what they could possibly do, or what they should not do, about crimes like this and the deep pains that lie behind the superficial killing; Or perhaps, in fact, there was nothing anyone could do to save us from our ""original sin"" without a higher force in a future existance. To see what I mean, you better watch the movie.There are movies that are not confusing, that make one feel good about himself and the world around after watching them. However, they only show one face of reality; there is another face of reality within and amongst us that is ugly and disturbing, it is too real for the world of Hollywood fantasies, but it is something that we can not ignore.

Maybe the term I'm looking for isn't ""self-important"" but ""self-indulgent,"" as there's no doubt that ""Bully"" is that, too.

I guess that leaves the miscreants themselves the intended audience--if so, is the film supposed to indulge their narcissism?

Perhaps he's just telling as it happened, and leaving it up to us to decide. But if honesty was the intention here, I can't help thinking ""Bully"" would have worked much better as a documentary where the motivations and backgrounds of the protagonists could have been more thoroughly explored. As a dramatization, there are just too many characters and too little time for the really interesting thing - the psychology behind such morally vacuous teen mob behaviour - to be adequately examined. The gap is filled with a few falteringly written expository scenes: Marty sobbing to Lisa on the beach; Heather giggling about her hideous home life. These try to show the emotional torture and moral emptiness which might lead to such criminal lunacy, but succeed only in sounding contrived. Generally, the young cast make the most of what they're given: Nick Stahl is great as the bully-boy Bobby (though the character is underdeveloped) and Brad Renfro as Marty is typically, chillingly, superb.

683107,A1SP75XHY3E02G,B00005U14H,"S. Vandermyn ""Movie Lover""","[0, 0]","A few years ago, I came across this book in the local library.  I remember reading it and can remember that the impact it had on my psyche.  The story has stayed in the back of my mind for several years.While suffering a regular bout of insomnia, I was flipping through the movie channels on cable late one night and I came across the movie ""Bully.""  I read the synopsis and instantly turned to it, remembering the story I read years before.On some level I felt bad for Marty.  Friends with Bobby since they were young, Marty was always abused by Bobby in some way, both physically and emotionally.  Marty was afraid to stand up to Bobby, who would one minute punch him in the face and the next minute tell Marty, ""You know you're my best friend, right?""Once Bobby and Marty meet Lisa and Ali, the story takes a turn.  Lisa loves Marty and can't help but be upset and angered by Bobby's abuse of Marty.  Bobby also takes out some of his agression by raping both Lisa and Ali.Lisa comes up with the notion that they could very possibly kill Bobby and get away with it.  At first, Marty thinks she is joking, then his attitude turns to reluctantance, then to agreeing with her.  All they need is the perfect plan and the proper weapons.  They enlist the help of Ali, their stoner friend Donny, their friend Heather who is fresh out of rehab again, Lisa's cousin Derek and a supposed ""mafia  hitman.""The actual murder scene in the movie is horribly disturbing and is pretty much the way I remember it in the book.  Although throughout the movie, one might side with Marty and Lisa, that Bobby is just an all-around jerk who deserves to die, the actual murder scene finds Bobby begging Marty for his life as he stabs him in the chest and you can't help but think that Bobby did not deserve this.It is so sad that this is a very true story and that these kids growing up in Florida really thought that this was the answer and that they would get away with it.  They thought no one would be looking for Bobby, who had a promising future to look forward to, opening a window tinting and stereo shop with his Dad.  They thought leaving Bobby's body in the canal would be the right thing to do because then the alligators would come and feast on him...Now, while these kids sit in jail - the majority of them for the rest of their lives, I can only think that their thoughts about what they did fills them with sorrow and regret.  Unfotunately for them, doing the absolute wrong thing would change their lives forever in an instant.I think the movie is directed quite well and it really is a good movie to see.  I agree with another review that some of the nudity in the film is not called for and is really not necessary.  I will warn you that again, this movie is quite disturbing and chances are, this movie will stay on your mind for a long time.",4,Very Disturbing But Compelling...,1048809600,"03 28, 2003",2003,2841,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'came', 'book', 'local', 'library', 'remember', 'reading', 'can', 'remember', 'impact', 'had', 'psyche', 'story', 'stayed', 'back', 'mind', 'several', 'years.While', 'suffering', 'regular', 'bout', 'insomnia', 'was', 'flipping', 'movie', 'channels', 'cable', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'came', 'movie', 'Bully', 'read', 'synopsis', 'instantly', 'turned', 'remembering', 'story', 'read', 'years', 'before.On', 'level', 'felt', 'bad', 'Marty', 'Friends', 'Bobby', 'were', 'young', 'Marty', 'was', 'always', 'abused', 'Bobby', 'way', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'Marty', 'was', 'afraid', 'stand', 'up', 'Bobby', 'who', 'would', 'one', 'minute', 'punch', 'face', 'next', 'minute', 'tell', 'Marty', 'know', ""'re"", 'best', 'friend', 'right', 'Once', 'Bobby', 'Marty', 'meet', 'Lisa', 'Ali', 'story', 'turn', 'Lisa', 'Marty', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'upset', 'angered', 'Bobby', 'abuse', 'Marty', 'Bobby', 'also', 'out', 'agression', 'raping', 'Lisa', 'Ali.Lisa', 'up', 'notion', 'could', 'very', 'possibly', 'kill', 'Bobby', 'get', 'away', 'first', 'Marty', 'joking', 'then', 'attitude', 'reluctantance', 'then', 'agreeing', 'need', 'perfect', 'plan', 'proper', 'weapons', 'enlist', 'help', 'Ali', 'stoner', 'friend', 'Donny', 'friend', 'Heather', 'who', 'fresh', 'rehab', 'again', 'Lisa', 'cousin', 'Derek', 'supposed', 'mafia', 'hitman', 'actual', 'murder', 'scene', 'movie', 'horribly', 'disturbing', 'pretty', 'much', 'way', 'remember', 'book', 'movie', 'one', 'might', 'side', 'Marty', 'Lisa', 'Bobby', 'just', 'all-around', 'jerk', 'who', 'die', 'actual', 'murder', 'scene', 'Bobby', 'begging', 'Marty', 'life', 'stabs', 'chest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'Bobby', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'this.It', 'so', 'sad', 'very', 'true', 'story', 'kids', 'growing', 'up', 'Florida', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'answer', 'would', 'get', 'away', 'thought', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'looking', 'Bobby', 'who', 'had', 'promising', 'future', 'look', 'forward', 'opening', 'window', 'tinting', 'stereo', 'shop', 'Dad', 'thought', 'leaving', 'Bobby', 'body', 'canal', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'because', 'then', 'alligators', 'would', 'come', 'feast', 'Now', 'kids', 'sit', 'jail', 'majority', 'rest', 'lives', 'can', 'only', 'think', 'thoughts', 'what', 'did', 'fills', 'sorrow', 'regret', 'Unfotunately', 'doing', 'absolute', 'wrong', 'thing', 'would', 'change', 'lives', 'forever', 'instant.I', 'think', 'movie', 'directed', 'quite', 'well', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'see', 'agree', 'review', 'nudity', 'film', 'not', 'called', 'really', 'not', 'necessary', 'will', 'warn', 'again', 'movie', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'chances', 'are', 'movie', 'will', 'stay', 'mind', 'long', 'time']",N/A
683108,AP9TSAQICVEVT,B00005U14H,The Ion,"[0, 0]","Fascinating film, these are ostensibly well adjusted kids yet their behaviour oscillates between fun-loving and depraved. Marty and the girl who was raped are the only two with real motive for killing the bully, yet the others take to it so casually as though it were a concert they were going to see instead of committing a murder. The point were they decide to kill him is such a shock to the system. One minute the kids + bully are hanging around together as though nothing is wrong, then suddenly a decision for murder is made, the transition from normal kids to killers is surreal.The actual murder itself is the true highlight of the movie, it is extremely vicious, brutal and tense. The emotional torment the bully inflicted on them demands that they be passionate in cruelty and the viewer may experience some involuntary satisfaction at what he is seeing, but when the bully cries ""Marty, im sorry"", the death begins to seem more regretful to the viewer. The scenes at the end fill us with sadness at the plight of the kids, although their crime is repugnant we cant help but feel sad that they took one wrong turn and as a result their lives are destroyed. The harsh prospect of spending life in prison is a steep fall from their previously hedonistic and law-abiding lives.Amazing performances from the young actors all round, particularly good were the 'mafia' hitman and Marty and his girlfriend. The film has lots of snappy dialogue and heated dramatic exchanges between the characters which never lets it get boring. Perhaps the abundance of sex scenes in the film is a little too much but for a Larry Clark film it's what we have come to expect. The ending is suitably grim and there is an excellent buildup to it from about halfway through as the characters become increasingly nervous and drop some breadcrumbs for the police to find, we realise these kids are just too dumb to get away with what they did.",4,A little scorcher of a drama,1115510400,"05 8, 2005",2005,1924,"['Fascinating', 'film', 'are', 'ostensibly', 'well', 'adjusted', 'kids', 'yet', 'behaviour', 'oscillates', 'fun-loving', 'depraved', 'Marty', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'raped', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'real', 'motive', 'killing', 'bully', 'yet', 'others', 'take', 'so', 'casually', 'were', 'concert', 'were', 'going', 'see', 'instead', 'committing', 'murder', 'point', 'were', 'decide', 'kill', 'shock', 'system', 'One', 'minute', 'kids', '+', 'bully', 'are', 'hanging', 'around', 'together', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'then', 'suddenly', 'decision', 'murder', 'made', 'transition', 'normal', 'kids', 'killers', 'surreal.The', 'actual', 'murder', 'true', 'highlight', 'movie', 'extremely', 'vicious', 'brutal', 'tense', 'emotional', 'torment', 'bully', 'inflicted', 'be', 'passionate', 'cruelty', 'viewer', 'may', 'experience', 'involuntary', 'satisfaction', 'what', 'seeing', 'when', 'bully', 'Marty', 'im', 'sorry', 'death', 'seem', 'more', 'regretful', 'viewer', 'scenes', 'end', 'sadness', 'plight', 'kids', 'crime', 'repugnant', 'cant', 'help', 'feel', 'sad', 'took', 'one', 'wrong', 'turn', 'result', 'lives', 'are', 'destroyed', 'harsh', 'prospect', 'spending', 'life', 'prison', 'steep', 'fall', 'previously', 'hedonistic', 'law-abiding', 'lives.Amazing', 'performances', 'young', 'actors', 'round', 'particularly', 'good', 'were', ""'mafia"", 'hitman', 'Marty', 'girlfriend', 'film', 'lots', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'heated', 'dramatic', 'exchanges', 'characters', 'never', 'get', 'boring', 'Perhaps', 'abundance', 'sex', 'scenes', 'film', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'film', 'what', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'ending', 'suitably', 'grim', 'excellent', 'buildup', 'halfway', 'characters', 'become', 'increasingly', 'nervous', 'drop', 'breadcrumbs', 'police', 'find', 'realise', 'kids', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'dumb', 'get', 'away', 'what', 'did']",N/A

The film was close to the real murder case (right down to the ruined defendants sitting in the courtroom) and the documentary was disturbing because you found out so much of the film was true.I've also recently watched HAVOC with Ann Hathaway, another movie about kids without parents destroying their lives in different ways.  Ultimately, it's the parents--who barely exist in both movies--who bear much of the blame for the murder and destruction of their own childrens' lives.  God forbid they actually punish their kids for smoking massive amounts of dope, running the streets all night, or date-raping young girls to gay porn videos.  You don't want to upset your kids, do you?Obviously this is a very widespread problem that reminds me of the Columbine massacre: if you're a parent and your kid has a website worshiping Adolph Hitler and an arsenal under his bed--and you DON'T know about it--you're screwing up, big time.The kids in HAVOC and BULLY also live in such desolation, without anyone to really care about them.

683110,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B00005U14H,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[2, 2]","I must confess up fron that I hateKids. I hate the casual nihilism. I hate the fact that Larry Clark is pretending that he wants us to feel bad about these creeps when he's just getting off on their horrible-ness. I hate the artless art where everyone mumbles their way through the movie as if they are stoned. Yes, the movie gave us Chloe Sevigny and Rosario Dawson, but I put it up there withThe Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Loveras a movie that art snobs claim to love but is at heart crap. And I publish books likeBADASS HORRORso it's not like I'm a prude that gets the vapors at nihilism or violence.When I started this movie, I didn't hold out much hope. Brad Renfro staring at the camera looking angry and mean was a bad sign especially when you think that this guy is the hero. The fact that he was capable of creating compelling characters in movies like Apt Pupil Entertainment Poster Print, 27x40 didn't register. And the fact that he's allowing himself to get pushed around throughout the movie, first by Nick Stahl (as the title character) and then by Lisa, the mumbling girlfriend, doesn't help.But then as the movie continues, something happens. Maybe it's because Nick Stahl does some horrible things but his personality comes through and you can see why Renfro hangs out with him. Maybe it's the way that Lisa worms her way into the psyche of Renfro so he starts following her instead of Stahl and maybe it's just the way Renfro uses his characteristics to show that he's not just a passive observer in his life, but a truly angry teenager who is going through a slow burn of rage just simmering beneath the surface.And the scene where Lisa confesses to her friend about the murder (there's a murder in this movie) and she doesn't know whether she wants to laugh it off or admit to being freaked out is Larry Clark at his best. I didn't know that such an entity existed.So even though you have to get over the mumbling documentary feel and the casual nihiliism to enjoy this movie, unlike Kids, it's actually worth the effort.ANd the actor who played Telly shows up and sounds like Ray Romano.

But the shock does not come from the violence, but from the excessive amount of nudity.  That's no wonder because the director is Larry Clark, known for his film like &quot;Kids&quot; and photo books such as &quot;Teenage Lust.&quot;Two kids Bobby (Nick Stahl) and Marty (Brad Renfro) have been friends, but the relations has got shaky recently.  Each of them belongs to the different social groups, and these days Marty is likely to receive very humiliating treatment, verbally and physically, from Bobby.  After several events including a case of date-rape, Marty comes to know that he is not the only one who wishes Bobby's demise.  And to make matters worse, those kids ask for help from the wrong person Kaufman (Leo Fitzpatrick from &quot;Kids&quot;).The acting from male players are all credible, especially Renfro and Stahl while the female ones are too weak, probably because they are not required to do much except for throwing away the clothes.  But at least Larry Clark deserves praise for not depicting these kids as monsters, and whether intentional or not, the most tragic scenes are morbidly fascinating, with good descriptions of teenagers who don't know what they are doing.  The film doens't try to explain why this kind of terrible thing happened, and that turns out a wise choice.What I don't understand is the frequent use of the kids' nidity (not sex scenes themselves).  If Larry Clark says sex is essential in drawing the picture of teeenagers, I don't disagree.  But when he does shows naked girls's bodies too much as he does, even when there is absolutely no need to do that (like phone calling), the film becomes an exploitaion film you could see at drive-in theaters back in the 50s.  I am not against these films (I actually like these films such as &quot;High School Confidential&quot;), but considering the subject matter and its serious nature, this way of shooting the teenagers is completely misguided.Lastly, I should have given more stars if Larry Clark stuck to his gun, claiming his right to do what he wants to do.  OK, but it is embarrassing to know that his follow-up to &quot;Bully&quot; was simply awful &quot;Teenage Caveman,&quot; poor recycle of 1950s monster flick, which would discredit anything.

683118,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00005U14H,Westley,"[2, 4]","""Bully"" is the third film directed by Larry Clark and is a worthy companion piece to his earlier film, ""Kids.""  Both films tell of a group of mostly white disaffected suburban kids.  The kids run their own world and the adults are clueless about what their kids are doing.  Brad Renfro stars as Marty, who is a fairly nice person but without ambition.  He has been friends since childhood with Bobby, played by Nick Stahl.  Bobby is very cruel to Marty and constantly forces him to do thing that he does not want to do.  Marty tries to avoid Bobby, but Bobby is much smarter than he is and Marty cannot break off the friendship.  These two actors are very good in this film, with a crude realism that brings a great deal to the story.  Both also scored in other films this year, Renfro in ""Ghostworld"" and Stahl in ""In the Bedroom.""Equally good is Rachel Miner (ex-wife of Macaulay Culkin), who plays Renfro's girlfriend, Lisa.  Lisa is amazed that a ""hunk"" like Renfro would be interested in her and she sets out to do anything to protect him and their relationship.  This bond sets the plot into action when she gets tired of seeing Stahl bully Renfro and decides that Stahl needs to be killed.  The film is apparently based on a true-life murder in a Florida suburb (the DVD includes a section with pictures of the real-life participants).They are joined by several friends, including wild Ali (Bijou Phillips), stoner Donny (Michael Pitt), clueless Heather (Kelly Garner), and Lisa's cousin Derek (Daniel Franzese).  Bobby has raped Ali, but the other kids really have no reason to join in this murder; they fall to mob mentality and seem to simply have nothing more interesting to do.  They hire a ""hitman,"" played by Leo Fitzpatrick, who starred as Telly in ""Kids.""  The movie is like a black comedy in tone.  The kids do and say outrageous things and seem to have no moral center.On the negative side, the acting by the adults (parents of the kids) is amateurish at times.  It's unclear whether Clark wanted the adults to seem stiff to help emphasize how much they are not a part of their kids' world, or if the actors just don't do a good job.  Also, at times, it is hard to know whether Clark intends this film to be documentary-like in quality or soft-core pornography (there is a great deal of sex and nudity).  The camera leers at the nude teens, which makes their actions even more unnerving.The DVD version has quite a few extras, including interviews with Clark and the young actors.  However, there is no director's commentary track, which is a debit.  Overall, ""Bully"" is an intriguing and funny movie with some terrific acting by its young cast.",4,"Intriguing, but amateurish at times",1018051200,"04 6, 2002",2002,2663,"['Bully', 'third', 'film', 'directed', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'worthy', 'companion', 'piece', 'earlier', 'film', 'Kids', 'films', 'tell', 'group', 'mostly', 'white', 'disaffected', 'suburban', 'kids', 'kids', 'run', 'own', 'world', 'adults', 'are', 'clueless', 'what', 'kids', 'are', 'doing', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'Marty', 'who', 'fairly', 'nice', 'person', 'ambition', 'been', 'friends', 'childhood', 'Bobby', 'played', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'Bobby', 'very', 'cruel', 'Marty', 'constantly', 'forces', 'do', 'thing', 'not', 'want', 'do', 'Marty', 'tries', 'avoid', 'Bobby', 'Bobby', 'much', 'smarter', 'Marty', 'can', 'not', 'break', 'off', 'friendship', 'two', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'crude', 'realism', 'great', 'deal', 'story', 'Both', 'also', 'scored', 'other', 'films', 'year', 'Renfro', 'Ghostworld', 'Stahl', 'Bedroom', 'Equally', 'good', 'Rachel', 'Miner', 'ex-wife', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'who', 'Renfro', 'girlfriend', 'Lisa', 'Lisa', 'amazed', 'hunk', 'Renfro', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'out', 'do', 'anything', 'protect', 'relationship', 'bond', 'plot', 'action', 'when', 'tired', 'seeing', 'Stahl', 'bully', 'Renfro', 'Stahl', 'be', 'killed', 'film', 'apparently', 'based', 'true-life', 'murder', 'Florida', 'suburb', 'DVD', 'section', 'pictures', 'real-life', 'participants', '.They', 'are', 'joined', 'several', 'friends', 'including', 'wild', 'Ali', 'Bijou', 'Phillips', 'stoner', 'Donny', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'clueless', 'Heather', 'Kelly', 'Garner', 'Lisa', 'cousin', 'Derek', 'Daniel', 'Franzese', 'Bobby', 'raped', 'Ali', 'other', 'kids', 'really', 'have', 'reason', 'join', 'murder', 'fall', 'mob', 'mentality', 'seem', 'simply', 'have', 'nothing', 'more', 'interesting', 'do', 'hire', 'hitman', 'played', 'Leo', 'Fitzpatrick', 'who', 'starred', 'Telly', 'Kids', 'movie', 'black', 'comedy', 'tone', 'kids', 'do', 'say', 'outrageous', 'things', 'seem', 'have', 'moral', 'negative', 'side', 'acting', 'adults', 'parents', 'kids', 'amateurish', 'times', 'unclear', 'Clark', 'wanted', 'adults', 'seem', 'stiff', 'help', 'emphasize', 'how', 'much', 'are', 'not', 'part', 'kids', 'world', 'actors', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'good', 'job', 'Also', 'times', 'hard', 'know', 'Clark', 'film', 'be', 'documentary-like', 'quality', 'soft-core', 'pornography', 'great', 'deal', 'sex', 'nudity', 'camera', 'nude', 'teens', 'actions', 'even', 'more', 'unnerving.The', 'DVD', 'version', 'quite', 'few', 'extras', 'including', 'interviews', 'Clark', 'young', 'actors', 'However', 'director', 'commentary', 'track', 'debit', 'Overall', 'Bully', 'intriguing', 'funny', 'movie', 'terrific', 'acting', 'young', 'cast']",N/A
