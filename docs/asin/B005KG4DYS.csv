1463814,A1W9JOFE6F89FB,B005KG4DYS,Amber MacDonald,"[2, 3]","I can remember when I was a little girl, I absolutely loved Strawberry Shortcake. I had my room decorated in it, a birthday cake, toys, and yes even undies. When I received the Strawberry Shortcake ""Bright Lights Big Dreams"" DVD, I was so excited to watch this movie alongside of my little girl. My little girl and I both watched the movie together and really enjoyed it. I loved how, throughout the movie, it gave examples of the difference between right and wrong. I love when my kids watch shows or cartoons that offer some sort of virtue. This movie really helped little girls build their own character, be respectful and make right decisions. This is a great movie for little girls younger then one but can also go up to around eight or nine years old.",5,A Cute Movie,1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,757,"['can', 'remember', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'Strawberry', 'Shortcake', 'had', 'room', 'decorated', 'birthday', 'cake', 'yes', 'even', 'undies', 'When', 'received', 'Strawberry', 'Shortcake', 'Bright', 'Lights', 'Big', 'Dreams', 'DVD', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'watch', 'movie', 'alongside', 'little', 'girl', 'little', 'girl', 'watched', 'movie', 'together', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'loved', 'how', 'movie', 'gave', 'examples', 'difference', 'right', 'wrong', 'love', 'when', 'kids', 'watch', 'cartoons', 'offer', 'sort', 'virtue', 'movie', 'really', 'helped', 'little', 'girls', 'build', 'own', 'character', 'be', 'respectful', 'make', 'right', 'decisions', 'great', 'movie', 'little', 'girls', 'younger', 'then', 'one', 'can', 'also', 'go', 'up', 'eight', 'nine', 'years', 'old']","Strawberry Shortcake: Bright Lights, Big Dreams"

Between irritating voices and terrible manners I really don't like my daughter watching it.
