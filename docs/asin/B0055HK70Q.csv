I thought it was enjoyable to watch, but hardly groundbreaking. Unfortunately I was able to predict almost everything within a half-hour. Still it was a nice television film that surprisingly got transferred to dvd. Personally I wouldn't buy it, even if the always entertaining, and quite hot, Natasha Hendridge is in it. Well worth a rental though IMO if you can't find it getting repeated on cable tv.",3,"Enjoyable, but predictable!",1315699200,"09 11, 2011",2011,523,"['remember', 'seeing', 'Lifetime', 'maybe', 'year', 'ago', 'Thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'interesting', 'network', 'mostly', 'women', 'thought', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'hardly', 'groundbreaking', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'able', 'predict', 'almost', 'everything', 'half-hour', 'Still', 'was', 'nice', 'television', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'got', 'transferred', 'dvd', 'Personally', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'even', 'always', 'entertaining', 'quite', 'hot', 'Natasha', 'Hendridge', 'Well', 'rental', 'IMO', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'getting', 'repeated', 'cable', 'tv']",The Devil's Teardrop

1442869,A387BD735MI50R,B0055HK70Q,R. Schultz,"[0, 0]","This is a rather bland drama that was obviously born as a made-for-TV Canadian movie. It was transferred from TV without editing. Even the fades that would have surrounded commercial breaks have been left in. Since it was designed to be aired to general audiences, it has a certain unrealistic Cleaver Family patness.However, there are certain points about the movie that make it worth watching. For one thing, we get to see a documents examiner at work. That branch of forensics usually doesn't figure in our TV CSI shows, which generally feature only the more sensational aspects of criminal investigations.""The Devil's Teardrop"" has a good, resonant title - and an interesting ending. So I didn't mind too much that what came in the middle of this sandwich had a bit of the flatness of processed cheese.",3,"Rather Bland, But Has Its Moments",1322611200,"11 30, 2011",2011,806,"['rather', 'bland', 'drama', 'was', 'obviously', 'born', 'made-for-TV', 'Canadian', 'movie', 'was', 'transferred', 'TV', 'editing', 'Even', 'fades', 'would', 'have', 'surrounded', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'was', 'designed', 'be', 'aired', 'general', 'audiences', 'certain', 'unrealistic', 'Cleaver', 'Family', 'patness.However', 'are', 'certain', 'points', 'movie', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'thing', 'get', 'see', 'documents', 'examiner', 'work', 'branch', 'forensics', 'usually', ""n't"", 'figure', 'TV', 'CSI', 'shows', 'generally', 'feature', 'only', 'more', 'sensational', 'aspects', 'criminal', 'investigations', 'Devil', 'Teardrop', 'good', 'resonant', 'title', 'interesting', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'came', 'middle', 'sandwich', 'had', 'bit', 'flatness', 'processed', 'cheese']",The Devil's Teardrop
1442870,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B0055HK70Q,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","The movie opens with a killer (John MacDonald) shooting people in broad daylight at 12:00 in Union Station, Washington DC. We get to see the killer's face. In spite of this, there is no good description of the killer who looks like Dolph Lundgren and apparently there are no cameras in use there either. The authorities get a note and phone call from a Russian accented man, whose grammar is incorrect. The note asks for a ransom, or else the killer, known as ""The Digger"" will continue to kill. The killer drops black shell casings as his calling card.Easy enough. You plant the money with a tracking device, then nab the guy...unless the guy dies crossing the street in a hit and run and there is no one to pay the ransom to. Natasha Henstridge plays Margaret Lukas, the FBI person in charge of quickly locating the killer before he kills again.The movie runs with a brief subplot with Tom Everett Scott as Parker Kincaid. He is the best manuscript expert who left the FBI over an incident which still gives his son Robby (Jake Goodman) nightmares. His daughter Shannon (Rachel Marcus) seems well adjusted. His drunken ex-wife (Joanna Jang) is now sober and plans on getting married. She is serving papers so she can have custody of her children who she has been trying to buy with gifts. Olivia Jones plays Parker's attorney.Of course the two plots run together as Parker consents to help. He tells us things about the man who wrote it and possible future targets. Natasha Henstridge appears to have some past emotional issues in case this crime story didn't have enough drama.The movie is made for TV with its timely commercial fade outs, complete with a few notes of dramatic music. It has 3 Canadian award nominations.The title, ""Devil's Teardrop"" comes from the handwriting analysis, the way the ""i"" was dotted. The movie was more mediocre crime drama than ""chilling suspense"" with more drama than action. The acting was a bit bland. I thought Rachel Marcus was good as a child actor while Joanna Jung was almost comically bad. There really wasn't any great dialouge.Note: The FBI has a machine that can read indentations on a piece of paper (ESDA). It is so sensitive it can read up to the previous 5 pages of indentations. It is nothing like what the movie shows us.",3,MEDIOCRE CRIME DRAMA,1315094400,"09 4, 2011",2011,2275,"['movie', 'killer', 'John', 'MacDonald', 'shooting', 'people', 'broad', 'daylight', '12:00', 'Union', 'Station', 'Washington', 'DC', 'get', 'see', 'killer', 'face', 'spite', 'good', 'description', 'killer', 'who', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'apparently', 'are', 'cameras', 'use', 'either', 'authorities', 'get', 'note', 'phone', 'call', 'Russian', 'accented', 'man', 'grammar', 'incorrect', 'note', 'ransom', 'else', 'killer', 'known', 'Digger', 'will', 'continue', 'kill', 'killer', 'black', 'shell', 'casings', 'calling', 'card.Easy', 'enough', 'plant', 'money', 'tracking', 'device', 'then', 'guy', 'guy', 'crossing', 'street', 'hit', 'run', 'one', 'pay', 'ransom', 'Natasha', 'Henstridge', 'Margaret', 'Lukas', 'FBI', 'person', 'charge', 'quickly', 'locating', 'killer', 'again.The', 'movie', 'brief', 'subplot', 'Tom', 'Everett', 'Scott', 'Parker', 'Kincaid', 'best', 'manuscript', 'expert', 'who', 'left', 'FBI', 'incident', 'still', 'son', 'Robby', 'Jake', 'Goodman', 'daughter', 'Shannon', 'Rachel', 'Marcus', 'well', 'adjusted', 'drunken', 'ex-wife', 'Joanna', 'Jang', 'now', 'sober', 'plans', 'getting', 'married', 'serving', 'papers', 'can', 'have', 'custody', 'children', 'who', 'been', 'trying', 'buy', 'gifts', 'Olivia', 'Jones', 'Parker', 'attorney.Of', 'course', 'two', 'plots', 'run', 'together', 'Parker', 'consents', 'help', 'things', 'man', 'who', 'wrote', 'possible', 'future', 'targets', 'Natasha', 'Henstridge', 'have', 'past', 'emotional', 'issues', 'case', 'crime', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'drama.The', 'movie', 'made', 'TV', 'timely', 'commercial', 'fade', 'outs', 'complete', 'few', 'notes', 'dramatic', 'music', '3', 'Canadian', 'award', 'nominations.The', 'title', 'Devil', 'Teardrop', 'handwriting', 'analysis', 'way', 'i', 'was', 'dotted', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'mediocre', 'crime', 'drama', 'chilling', 'suspense', 'more', 'drama', 'action', 'acting', 'was', 'bit', 'bland', 'thought', 'Rachel', 'Marcus', 'was', 'good', 'child', 'actor', 'Joanna', 'Jung', 'was', 'almost', 'comically', 'bad', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'dialouge.Note', 'FBI', 'machine', 'can', 'read', 'indentations', 'piece', 'paper', 'ESDA', 'so', 'sensitive', 'can', 'read', 'up', 'previous', '5', 'pages', 'indentations', 'nothing', 'what', 'movie']",The Devil's Teardrop

When a man known only as ""The Digger"" opens fire in a train station many are left dead.  The only clue the FBI has is a hand written letter with demands on it.  Agent Margurete (Henstridge) needs help analyzing it and the best is retired specialist Kincaid (Scott).  I was a little weary of this at the outset.  The actors I like, but it is a ""Lifetime"" movie, and that kinda scared me.  After about 10 min I was hooked and was really shocked at how good this movie was.  Good acting and good story telling made this one tense all the way through.  Not only is it one of the best ""Lifetime"" movies I have seen, it's also one of the better movies coming out this week.  Without trying to give anything away, this is also the first ""Lifetime"" movie I have seen where the man is portrayed as a good guy.  Way to go.  The only complaint I had is the ending, but being the type of movie this is it is to be expected.  Just a little too anti-climatic for my liking.  Other then that I really enjoyed this.  Overall, very entertaing and tense, a very good choice. I give it a B+.Would I watch it again? - I might, to catch clues I may have missed.*Also try - Lies In Plain Sight & The Zodiac",4,"Not just a good ""Lifetime"" movie, this is a good movie in general.  Good acting and tense. I really liked it.
