270149,A3BFJFJRXMWXAX,6301810619,Andy Williamson,"[19, 19]","Alas, pianist Thelonious Monk was unable to acquire chicken dumplins in Copenhagen during a tour stop.  The room service waiter kindly offered him chicken salad.  He also ordered mashed potatoes.Thelonious Sphere Monk (1917-1982) is generally credited with inventing what we call be-bop, that fiery brand of jazz that emerged post WW II with Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and others.  Be-bop sounded the death-knell of big band/swing like Glenn Miller and Woody Herman.  Monk was there at the forefront although it would be years before he garnered the acceptance or credit he deserved.  Bouts with mental illness also hampered Monk from time to time.  He was hospitalized numerous times.This DVD compiles FASCINATING black and white footage of Monk during his 1968 tour.  We see Monk smoking, Monk talking and laughing, Monk recording, Monk yelling at Teo Macero (""Why can't nobody do what I tell 'em to do!"" an exasperated Monk yells after learning that Macero-in the control booth-failed to record the song the group had just finished), Monk with his wife Nellie, Monk on the street, getting dressed, spinning in circles etc.  This is truly amazing footage folks.  If only we had such a visual document for every great jazz artist.The dialogue is very interesting.  Monk himself is often hard to understand, his words often seem to run together.  But I was able to understand enough.  There are interviews with musicians and managers and others.  It is great to see Monk's main saxophonist, Charlie Rouse, commenting on his friend.  In one of the highlights of the film we see Monk rehearsing his group prior to a London performance.  It is awesome to watch Monk lead Rouse, Phil Woods, and Johnny Griffin (!) thru the chord and tempo changes.  Wow.  It's also great to *hear* so much great music in a film.  This is almost a musical in that sense.We don't get any extras except a trailer here, but the strength of the film itself would make it a five star purchase if nothing else were on the disc.Essential.",5,Chicken dumplins in Denmark?,1036972800,"11 11, 2002",2002,2015,"['Alas', 'pianist', 'Thelonious', 'Monk', 'was', 'unable', 'acquire', 'chicken', 'dumplins', 'Copenhagen', 'tour', 'stop', 'room', 'service', 'waiter', 'kindly', 'offered', 'chicken', 'salad', 'also', 'ordered', 'mashed', 'potatoes.Thelonious', 'Sphere', 'Monk', '1917-1982', 'generally', 'credited', 'inventing', 'what', 'call', 'be-bop', 'fiery', 'brand', 'jazz', 'emerged', 'post', 'WW', 'II', 'Charlie', 'Parker', 'Dizzy', 'Gillespie', 'others', 'Be-bop', 'sounded', 'death-knell', 'big', 'band/swing', 'Glenn', 'Miller', 'Woody', 'Herman', 'Monk', 'was', 'forefront', 'would', 'be', 'years', 'garnered', 'acceptance', 'credit', 'deserved', 'Bouts', 'mental', 'illness', 'also', 'hampered', 'Monk', 'time', 'time', 'was', 'hospitalized', 'numerous', 'times.This', 'DVD', 'FASCINATING', 'black', 'white', 'footage', 'Monk', '1968', 'tour', 'see', 'Monk', 'smoking', 'Monk', 'talking', 'laughing', 'Monk', 'recording', 'Monk', 'yelling', 'Teo', 'Macero', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'nobody', 'do', 'what', 'tell', 'do', 'exasperated', 'Monk', 'yells', 'learning', 'Macero-in', 'control', 'booth-failed', 'record', 'song', 'group', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'Monk', 'wife', 'Nellie', 'Monk', 'street', 'getting', 'dressed', 'spinning', 'circles', 'etc', 'truly', 'amazing', 'footage', 'folks', 'only', 'had', 'such', 'visual', 'document', 'great', 'jazz', 'artist.The', 'dialogue', 'very', 'interesting', 'Monk', 'often', 'hard', 'understand', 'words', 'often', 'seem', 'run', 'together', 'was', 'able', 'understand', 'enough', 'are', 'interviews', 'musicians', 'managers', 'others', 'great', 'see', 'Monk', 'main', 'saxophonist', 'Charlie', 'Rouse', 'commenting', 'friend', 'one', 'highlights', 'film', 'see', 'Monk', 'rehearsing', 'group', 'prior', 'London', 'performance', 'awesome', 'watch', 'Monk', 'lead', 'Rouse', 'Phil', 'Woods', 'Johnny', 'Griffin', 'thru', 'chord', 'tempo', 'changes', 'Wow', 'also', 'great', '*hear*', 'so', 'much', 'great', 'music', 'film', 'almost', 'musical', 'sense.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'extras', 'trailer', 'here', 'strength', 'film', 'would', 'make', 'five', 'star', 'purchase', 'nothing', 'else', 'were', 'disc.Essential']",N/A

Straight No Chaser captures Thelonious Monk as a human being which is something one could never do based on his music. The songs alone would make one mistake him for an angel. Here, the stammering, lost, frail genius is fully evident and contextualized in his own voice and through the opinions of those who knew him. I found his son's remarks to be of great value as viewers can tell that he had a very complex and conflictual relationship with his father. This is to be expected given that Monk had schizophrenia. Luckily, the documentary does not shy away from his condition and the realities of how debilitated he must have been for so much of his life. That he was able to put together the brilliant musical arrangements he did is quite extraordinary. The family story is compelling as well. Clearly, without his wife there is no way in which Monk could have been anywhere near as successful as he was. Best of all is the music--reproduced here with seemingly endless life performances.

The movie is filled with wonderful private moments like these, though I can't say how much interest it will hold for those not familiar with Monk. For me, however, and for many others who are infatuated with him and his music, the footage in this documentary is gold. The character of Monk is rounded out for us, and we find that he was just as unique and strange in his life as he was in his music. He was truly in his own world, and though for 90 minutes we see him up close, with his musicians, with his wife Nellie, with the Baroness Nica, see his bizarre behavior backstage, at the airport, in the hotel, we are no closer to getting inside his head. For that, one simply needs to hear the music.And the music collected in the movie is astonishing--An early television appearance where Monk is miffed by Count Basie staring at him across the piano during a performance...several shows with a quartet including Charlie Rouse...great footage of the big band sessions of the mid 60s, with Rouse, Johnny Griffin, and Phil Woods scrambling to learn the arrangements...and the great Columbia session, where Monk becomes visibly annoyed, but still has time for a wonderfully tender moment with pal Teo. There are interviews with Monk's managers, his son, Charlie Rouse, and a fine piano duet of &quot;Well You Needn't&quot; by Tommy Flanagan and Barry Harris, reminding one and all that not only was Monk one of the most distinctive piano players in jazz, but that, along with Ellington and Charles Mingus, he was one of the most brilliant composers as well.",5,&quot;Why nobody just wanna do what I ask 'em to do?!&quot;,1063324800,"09 12, 2003",2003,1761,"['So', 'frustrated', 'Monk', 'late', '1960s', 'Columbia', 'recording', 'session', 'finishing', 'haunting', 'run-through', 'quot', 'Ugly', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'learning', 'producer', 'Teo', 'Macero', 'neglected', 'record', 'movie', 'filled', 'wonderful', 'private', 'moments', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'much', 'interest', 'will', 'hold', 'not', 'familiar', 'Monk', 'however', 'many', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'infatuated', 'music', 'footage', 'documentary', 'gold', 'character', 'Monk', 'rounded', 'out', 'find', 'was', 'just', 'unique', 'strange', 'life', 'was', 'music', 'was', 'truly', 'own', 'world', '90', 'minutes', 'see', 'up', 'close', 'musicians', 'wife', 'Nellie', 'Baroness', 'Nica', 'see', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'backstage', 'airport', 'hotel', 'are', 'closer', 'getting', 'head', 'one', 'simply', 'hear', 'music.And', 'music', 'collected', 'movie', 'astonishing', 'early', 'television', 'appearance', 'where', 'Monk', 'miffed', 'Count', 'Basie', 'staring', 'piano', 'performance', 'several', 'shows', 'quartet', 'including', 'Charlie', 'Rouse', 'great', 'footage', 'big', 'band', 'sessions', 'mid', '60s', 'Rouse', 'Johnny', 'Griffin', 'Phil', 'Woods', 'scrambling', 'learn', 'arrangements', 'great', 'Columbia', 'session', 'where', 'Monk', 'visibly', 'annoyed', 'still', 'time', 'wonderfully', 'tender', 'moment', 'pal', 'Teo', 'are', 'interviews', 'Monk', 'managers', 'son', 'Charlie', 'Rouse', 'fine', 'piano', 'duet', 'quot', 'Well', 'Need', ""n't"", 'quot', 'Tommy', 'Flanagan', 'Barry', 'Harris', 'reminding', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'Monk', 'one', 'most', 'distinctive', 'piano', 'players', 'jazz', 'Ellington', 'Charles', 'Mingus', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'composers', 'as', 'well']",N/A

The only musician he really liked was Johnny Griffin. When Teo Macero spoke him in the recording studio he said, ""I heard you before you said it.""When two women in Europe ask him for his ""signature,"" he sits down on a bench in the airport, signs for them, and says ""You're welcome.""It is obvious that he is never really comfortable with anyone but his wife and Nica de Koenigswarter. His introduction of ""Pannonica"" in the Baroness's house in New Jersey is the only time in the whole documentary when he sounds truly relaxed. Fittingly, it is to her that he confides one day, ""I am very seriously ill.""His son gives crucial context to Monk's mental problems, which were never clearly diagnosed. His sudden retirement from music in 1971 remains a mystery. But, knowing him as we know him from this superb documentary, we understand that his gift was a fugitive thing that could be taken away at any moment.In two interludes, Barry Harris and Tommy Flanagan play his music.

It is not one of these hysterically edited hyper-modern presentations, which a lot of documentaries tend to be these days.This relief aside, there is something that isn't much discussed here, though, and that are the highlights of Monk's career; when he had success with certain compositions or recordings,--or even which recordings that were successful--he's more presented ""on the whole,"" even though the documentary basically is chronological. There is, however, a ""Monk Career Highlights"" feature in text, but it's very short - the career-highlight feature of executive producer Clint Eastwood is twice as long.""Straight No Chaser"" is probably the most informative documentary made of Monk so far.

Well, he backed a good one here. This is a documentary film and not a music video. But there's plenty of music in it. A very nice balance, I think.What a story this is. The Monk was losing his mind. Something was eating his brain up. I look at this documentary like a Vincent van Gogh type story. A real tragedy. We see the whole sad story as it plays out in his life and his music right before our eyes. We see the Monk struggling at his piano as he struggles with the world around him. We meet his loving and devoted wife and son. We hear many of his contemporaries tell us about him. We follow him around to foreign countries, through dingy bus stations, in smokey night clubs and bars, recording studios and up on the concert stage.You want this one, believe me. This is so well done and such a great portrait. I play it over and over. I usually get it out because I want to see and hear the Monk doing his thing but every time I watch it the phenomenally tragic story hits me. What a problem for a man to have to deal with - the losing of his mind. I often wonder how much of his unusual creativity was the poor man simply adjusting to his mental deterioration - hesitating, trying to remember, selecting his next note with a wait and see attitude. Is this the one or is it this one that I want to play? What am I doing here? And then the natural genius kicks in and off he goes.His spinning in the subway station is haunting. His difficulty communicating with words and with his written music was something to watch. The patience of his fellow musicians and their respect for his creative gift. You had to laugh  at the struggle but yet the sadness is always there. You got to know that he knows something is disconnecting. He finally confesses to his wife, ""I ain't right"" or something to that effect.The music is always great but the story is greater. My hat is off to Bruce Ricker who put it all together. Wow!

270166,AI48RS9GEGGFC,6301810619,Richard M. Rollo,"[6, 7]","I don't think the filmmakers who shot this footage set out to make this film.  I think they set out to make another film, but they made this one for better or worse.  Thelonious Monk's ""eccentricities"" were well known to his fans, but this film shows more than just eccentric behavior.In the vein of eccentric behavior, a friend of mine told me about seeing  Thelonious Monk live at Shelly's Manne Hole in Hollywood back in the late 1960's.  It was a rare appearance for Monk in L.A. and it was not long afterward that the Manne Hole closed, as I recall.  He said that Thelonious stopped playing in the middle of the set and got up from the piano and began to spin around in a slow circles like a dervish.  My friend  showed me how Monk did it.My friend said he was disappointed.  He didn't pay to see Monk dance; he wanted to hear him play piano.  But I didn't give it too much thought at the time.  It seemed  harmless, eccentric.About fifteen years ago, I first saw ""Straight, No Chaser.""  It was  a shock to see Monk doing what my friend described so long before.  It looked much more ominous than his description.  There was one shot of him where he was spinning around and  his eyes momentarily went dull for half a second as if he had a mild stroke or seizure.  Even more shocking was how poorly Monk was functioning at times as he appeared in this movie.  Although I'm not a physician,  the word ""brain tumor"" just leapt into my mind.  That he died of a cerebral hemorrhage  confirms my guess.  It was so shocking that I think I missed most of the filmI recently saw this film  again. The commentary by Monk's son was most poignant  in describing his own childhood, coping with Monk's strange behavior and hospitalizations.  It didn't sound to me as if anyone really understood what was wrong with Monk at the time.Rethinking this film's significance: what Monk accomplished --- impressive as it  was --- is even more impressive when you think that while he was writing and performing, in the background, was this thing destroying him inside his own head.  He was struggling and straining to keep going against odds that were gradually slipping away from him. Every day, life got just a little harder for him. The effort eventually overcame him.  No wonder he stopped playing.Monk was lucky in leaving his unique music as his legacy under these circumstances.  He was also lucky in having married Nellie.  She was a great woman who clearly kept him going and loved him and took care of him.  We were lucky that he married Nellie as well for those same reasons.The music choices were well placed and add to the bittersweet quality of this video portrait.  There was always the playful quality of Monk's music, in a way reminiscent  of Erik Satie, but deeply rooted in the blues.The film does have a few comic moments.  The business where they had shipped a trunk full of empty Coke bottles halfway around the world in order to return them for deposit, struck me as hilarious.  I guess you had to grow up in an earlier era for that one.  Also, the ""Copenhagen pants"" and the ""chicken livers"" scenes were pretty funny.The exact medical facts will probably never be known.

There is no Denzel Washington nor Wesley Snipes to portray characters. No Quincy Jones or Spike Lee to explain the idiom.

Even if you're not a jazz fan, this is one engrossing documentary.I became an instant fan after renting a copy of this tape, and I had to get one right after.  The black and white footage of Monk traveling about Europe in the late 60's is in itself a treasure, as you catch the bebop genius in action, both onstage and off.The film does a very good job of explaining Monk's early life and career, but wisely lets the music and the footage do the talking.  Interviews with his son, longtime manager Harry Colomby and saxman Charlie Rouse provide real insight into Monk's music, his personality and lifestyle.  His wife Nellie and Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter are also honored for their love and support of the man.Some very revealing footage includes studio sessions, plus one where Monk becomes upset that a take was not being recorded.  Teo Macero, a sax player himself and a producer for Monk, as one reviewer noted, used his judgement and took the playing for rehearsal--oops.  But Monk's relationship with Macero and his mates seems a warm one for the most part.The film does not examine what really happened to Monk in his final years.

The core of this biographical documentary about the innovative pianist and co-founder of bebop Thelonious Monk is footage of a recording date and tour from 1968, plus priceless scenes of Monk offstage.  Filmmaker Bruce Ricker lets the 1968 film, shot by Michael and Christian Blackwood, speak for itself, interspersing stills, interviews, and some equally priceless early Fifties television footage.  The 1968 film is shot in gorgeous black and white; the dark smoky club is especially impressive, visually.Monk himself is imposing in black and white, with his greatcoat, pointy beard, and assorted headwear.  In one scene he rolls into the recording studio wearing a lensless eyeglass frame and a Polish cavalry officer's cap.  He shambles through the film, all sweat and bulk and cigarettes and raspy voice.  There are a couple of great shots of his distinctive, spinning dancing, full of little surprises.The recording studio scene is fascinating on a couple of levels.  We get to see Monk and sax sideman Charlie Rouse go over the score of a song together.  But we are also reminded that this is the late Sixties, when jazz isn't selling, and Monk is not a legend yet.  The clueless producer and recording engineer, while friendly, keep telling him to play something to warm up, and then neglecting to record it.  Monk finally loses patience and stomps off to a corner to angrily suck down a cigarette.The film also records a European tour, which also has its problems.  The octet that is supplied to him for the tour is oversized and under-rehearsed.  They learn their parts on the plane to London, and can't get it together onstage the first night there.  Much to the band's embarrassment, Monk has to stop songs to get everyone back on track.  But in a day or two they shine, and receive rapturous applause.The tour has its lighter moments.  Perhaps the funniest moment is Monk lying in his bed in a Copenhagen hotel, trying to get his familiar down home cooking from room service. &quot;Say, man; you got any chicken livers?&quot; &quot;Umm...Ve haff chicken sahlad.&quot; &quot;You got any regular liver?&quot; &quot;Regular...&quot; &quot;Beef liver?&quot; &quot;Umm...Ja, ve haff beef liffer.&quot;Here and there we meet a surprise guest.  Some late Fifties/early Sixties New York club concert footage shows a room full of heavy-lidded white hipsters enjoying music by Monk and none other than John Coltrane.  In a club kitchen, Monk clowns with Baroness Nica, who befriended many jazz musicians and in whose apartment Charlie Parker died.  There's a montage of his records, including _Underground_, which boasts the single coolest album cover in the history of recorded music.  The interview segments, with T. S. Monk, Jr. and Monk's manager are touching, giving insight as to how Monk struggled with the black dog, depression.  And a couple of greybeards play some of Monk's music arranged for two pianos.  It's lovely, fitting for the tribute it is.

270171,A2GWY78Y3YZ1I6,6301810619,Transfigured Knight,"[9, 19]","""Straight, No Chaser"" is a decent documentary, but what it fails to do is talk about the music and even less about the history of Monk. Yeah, it has rare performances never before seen, but this doesn't constitute a good film. It's only icing for the cake, but there's not a cake here. I felt it was a rather empty look into his history. I mean everybody who listens and are fans of Monk know where he was born at and how he started playing at a place called Minton's where he met and played with Dizzy and Parker. I would have liked to hear more about his own compositions and how they changed the history of jazz. Interviews with people like Johnny Griffin, Sonny Rollins, Ben Riley, Art Blakey, and other musicians who were more involved with the music making process would have been much more informative than simply interviewing family members and road managers. This may be okay for some people, but it didn't really sit well with me. I actually found these interviews really boring and lacking any kind of character.I will also say the documentary wasn't really well thought out. It seemed really scatter brained for lack of a better term. At one point, Monk is laying in bed asking for chicken livers, then the next he's playing out live. It's just really a mess of a documentary that really makes no sense. The historical value of the whole thing is incomplete. There is also no focus on his music of the 50s. It seems that his 60s quartet is getting all the press and unfortunately this is what makes this so frustrating, because Monk has made alot of music before he met Charlie Rouse, Larry Gales, and Ben Riley. As great as those musicians are, Monk was blazing trails way before he met those guys.There are some parts of this film that are priceless like the scenes where he is in the studio recording ""Ugly Beauty"" for his album ""Underground."" That to me is something that was unique and different to see, but for me there wasn't enough of this kind of footage to make it worthwhile.I will only recommend this documentary to hardcore fans of Monk, but if you're new to his music and want to hear more about his music or see him pick up the DVDs ""Thelonious Monk: American Composer"" or ""Jazz Icons: Live in '66.""",2,A Decent Documentary About Monk,1207958400,"04 12, 2008",2008,2226,"['Straight', 'No', 'Chaser', 'decent', 'documentary', 'what', 'do', 'talk', 'music', 'even', 'less', 'history', 'Monk', 'Yeah', 'rare', 'performances', 'never', 'seen', ""n't"", 'constitute', 'good', 'film', 'only', 'icing', 'cake', 'not', 'cake', 'here', 'felt', 'was', 'rather', 'empty', 'look', 'history', 'mean', 'everybody', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'Monk', 'know', 'where', 'was', 'born', 'how', 'started', 'playing', 'place', 'called', 'Minton', 'where', 'met', 'played', 'Dizzy', 'Parker', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'hear', 'more', 'own', 'compositions', 'how', 'changed', 'history', 'jazz', 'Interviews', 'people', 'Johnny', 'Griffin', 'Sonny', 'Rollins', 'Ben', 'Riley', 'Art', 'Blakey', 'other', 'musicians', 'who', 'were', 'more', 'involved', 'music', 'making', 'process', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'informative', 'simply', 'interviewing', 'family', 'members', 'road', 'managers', 'may', 'be', 'okay', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'sit', 'well', 'actually', 'found', 'interviews', 'really', 'boring', 'lacking', 'kind', 'character.I', 'will', 'also', 'say', 'documentary', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'seemed', 'really', 'scatter', 'brained', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'one', 'point', 'Monk', 'laying', 'bed', 'asking', 'chicken', 'livers', 'then', 'next', 'playing', 'out', 'live', 'just', 'really', 'mess', 'documentary', 'really', 'sense', 'historical', 'value', 'whole', 'thing', 'incomplete', 'also', 'focus', 'music', '50s', '60s', 'quartet', 'getting', 'press', 'unfortunately', 'what', 'so', 'frustrating', 'Monk', 'made', 'alot', 'music', 'met', 'Charlie', 'Rouse', 'Larry', 'Gales', 'Ben', 'Riley', 'As', 'great', 'musicians', 'are', 'Monk', 'was', 'blazing', 'trails', 'way', 'met', 'guys.There', 'are', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'priceless', 'scenes', 'where', 'studio', 'recording', 'Ugly', 'Beauty', 'album', 'Underground', 'something', 'was', 'unique', 'different', 'see', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'kind', 'footage', 'make', 'will', 'only', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'Monk', ""'re"", 'new', 'music', 'want', 'hear', 'more', 'music', 'see', 'pick', 'up', 'DVDs', 'Thelonious', 'Monk', 'American', 'Composer', 'Jazz', 'Icons', 'Live', ""'66""]",N/A

Thanks to Clint Eastwood, Monk's genius and odd behaviour will be preserved for future generations in a way that books could never hope to completely portray. The outstanding thing about Monk was his uniqueness and individuality. Yes he could play with other musicians and he could play compositions by other composers but regardless of what he played or who he played with, you always knew it was Monk. Others copied him but no one duplicated him and sadly there are very, very few artists/composers out there today with an original sound or style. I wish more people would wake up to the true genius of Monk and that may happen one day. And if it does, Mr. Eastwood should get a great deal of credit for his efforts and support.",5,A True Jewel,1167609600,"01 1, 2007",2007,858,"['standards', 'Thelonious', 'Monk', 'amongst', 'most', 'unique', 'musicians', 'composers', 'ever', 'produced', 'country', 'Thanks', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Monk', 'genius', 'odd', 'behaviour', 'will', 'be', 'preserved', 'future', 'generations', 'way', 'books', 'could', 'never', 'hope', 'completely', 'portray', 'outstanding', 'thing', 'Monk', 'was', 'uniqueness', 'individuality', 'could', 'play', 'other', 'musicians', 'could', 'play', 'compositions', 'other', 'composers', 'regardless', 'what', 'played', 'who', 'played', 'always', 'knew', 'was', 'Monk', 'Others', 'copied', 'one', 'duplicated', 'sadly', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'few', 'artists/composers', 'there', 'today', 'original', 'sound', 'style', 'wish', 'more', 'people', 'would', 'wake', 'up', 'true', 'genius', 'Monk', 'may', 'happen', 'one', 'day', 'Mr.', 'Eastwood', 'should', 'get', 'great', 'deal', 'credit', 'efforts', 'support']",N/A

Adams,"[10, 16]","I am a huge fan of Monk's music, but the footage used in this documentary came toward the end of his performing career, and Monk comes off as inarticulate and strange. The songs are great, but sound better of course on his CD's. The consensus seems to be that Thelonius was a manic-depressive, (now called bipolar disorder) although those actual terms are not used in the comments by his adult son or his former agent or bandmates. Something was wrong, however, with his mood control and his grasp on reality in his later years. I suppose this product is better than having no film at all of such a fascinating artist, but the 90 minutes really does not educate us much as to how and why TM created his jazz piano compositions or choose to play in such a unique style. I had high expectations before I sat down to view this film, and found myself getting bored halfway through.
