I was expecting more greatness from season two but felt underwhelmed and confused.  However, after watching season two of Darker Than Black in blu-ray, my opinion has improved.I began by watching the OVA's, which are the perfect link to transfer from season one to two.  The beginning of Gemini of the Meteor seems a bit hectic, but the OVA's put into context what is going on.  Without giving too much of the plot away, season 2 of Darker Than Black retains the same adrenaline, mysteries and strange humor from the first season.  If you like great-looking anime, this anime will be a feast for your eyes.If you are a fan of the first season of Darker Than Black, get this set.  I am giving Gemini of the Meteor four stars because the story/plot is not as great as season one.

1455341,A18JORXY0YARAX,B005DEUEOU,Anne with an e,"[6, 6]","Season one of Darker than Black is filled with great action, intrigue, and such and such.  Season two lacks in almost every department.  Sure, there is some great action, but far too little of it.  I'm not going to moan about Hei's loss of his powers: in fact, the way he can still take out contractors without using any contractor power himself just underlines how bad a-- he really is.  No, the problem with this show is its focus: a twelve year old girl whose contractor power is a magical girl transformation and an anti tank rifle.  Now, she's not as bad as she could be: there's not too much whining from her, she's occasionally useful and can fight decently every once in a while.  No, the problem is that she sucks up all the attention and everything's focused on her, and she's just not that interesting, at least not until the last couple episodes.  Hei and Kirihara, the other awesome main character from season one, are relegated to the back seat so we can focus on a pretty boring 12 year old.The OVA's are better than the second season in that, packed into 4 episodes is as much action as the entire 12 season two episodes.  The first OVA starts off with a four way fight between Hei and some syndicate contractors, so it's immediately intense.  The tone manages to match the first season better as well, being more tense and filled with a real and oppressive feeling of danger to our main characters. It also should be watched before the second season, as it sets that season up.Now, for the packaging: the blu-ray/dvd combo comes in a nice art box big enough to slip the complete first season set into if you happen to have that version.  If, like me, you have the six dvd set released first, it also holds volume six nicely, as long as you didn't also have the big art box for THOSE volumes.  It's a nice touch, I guess.  I haven't watched the blurays yet, but the dvds look great.  The extras include a couple episode commentary tracks which are generally worth a listen, clean opening/endings and of course, trailers.  Is it just my imagination or are trailers getting shorter and shorter?Any way, if you're a completionist you may as well pick this up.  The tonal and focus shift may annoy you, but it's not terrible.  It's at least worth watching once.  Like the first season, there's a lot of unanswered questions, including how the heck a meteor can fall when they can't launch anything off the surface of the planet and the stars are the souls of contractors, but they aren't enough to really break the story or anything.  The animation is beautiful over all and there's a couple decent action sequences.  The music varies from techno to porno, and is pretty bland.  A couple good tracks make it not terrible.

1455342,A33WAXM7XI8DQN,B005DEUEOU,"A. Sessler ""AniMason""","[0, 0]","Season 1 ended with Hei and Yin on the run from the syndicate. After losing Yin, Hei turns to alcoholism and finds odd jobs away from the syndicate in Russia where he meets Suo, a young Russian contractor that shares similiar characteristics as Hei, emotions that contradict a contractor.What ensues, is a plot that revolves around a predestined end of the world scenario.As with ssn 1, ssn 2 carries on the trend of strong character development, interesting contractor abilities and even stranger payments. The only real issue with Darker than Black Season 2 comes in the form of, lacking the same conclusiveness of the first season, and with no planned follow up as of yet, it may be some time before we get that closure. Season 1's end, though somewhat interpretive, practically implied: the world was safe, things were as they were, except for the world's half acknowledgement of the existence of contractors and Hei & Yin, disappeared into the night with the syndicate behind them. Season 2 on the other hand, ends somewhat abruptly and blatantly hints at forthcoming events. The packaged 4 episode OVA, effectively acts as a bridge between the two seasons.This is not meant to act as a deterrent though. What's left is just as one would expect from Darker Than Black, a dramatic/action masterpiece. Though in this season, emphasis isn't placed primarily on the intensity of the action, more so it is placed on a more emotionally engaging story.

The chipboard box nicely holds both season 1 and season 2. The quality of the blu-ray is much improved over the DVD release of season 1. The style of the soundtrack is different than in season 1, but I enjoyed it at least as much, maybe more. Ended up ordering theNo Geminisoundtrack from amazon's Japan site since the US store was out of stock and couldn't provide a ship date.Although I'd seen varied reviews about season 2 from fans of the first season, I really enjoyed it. It's an intelligent story that is well told. My only suggestion would be to watch the OVAs (included after the season 2 episodes) BEFORE watching the 12 episodes of Season 2, as they fill in the gaps between the seasons. If you'd rather start with season 2 and see how your guesses about what happened in between compare with the official version, you should probably watch them in the order they appear on the discs.This series has quickly become my favorite serious anime.

1455359,A2C2T9R7V2LRLJ,B005DEUEOU,Lazar,"[0, 0]","[SLIGHT SPOILERS]There are actually two reviews necessary--one for Season 2 and one for the OVA's.  Concerning the OVA's, they are excellent.  The plot thickens between Hei and Yin and the action scenes are some of the best in the entire series.  The animation ramps up as well, as though the animators tried to outdo every original fight scene from Season 1, and cram more of them into four episodes.  I think they succeeded.  Stream the OVA's and enjoy them.Season 2, on the other hand, is simply a disaster.  If it were its own anime, I would say it was mediocre, but being billed as a follow-up and worthy successor to The Black Contractor, it's simply a farce.  At times, it seemed to me that Gemini could have actually been an entirely different anime, so altered was the original structure of DTB.  Most horrifying is Hei's complete character transformation (becoming a drunk, letting his facial hair grow out, and basically looking like a homeless person).  Some have argued that this transformation ""deepens his character flaws"" or some such.  I argue that it ruins him as a character.  I think the majority of audiences would have wanted the Hei from the OVA's to continue kicking a** through Season 2, and I am among them.  Bones dropped the ball on this one.The second most obvious irritation is the introduction of Suo, and the whole ""training"" situation a la The Professional.  Except that Suo really has no redeeming qualities to make me interested in her in the slightest--not to mention that her power (pulling a giant piece of artillery out of her chest) sucks as a power--especially when she can only fire a couple of times!  Furthermore, we are FORCED TO WATCH THE ANIMATION OVER AND OVER, this annoying child pulling a gun out of her chest.  And yes, the animation is long enough to become tiresome.  Had no one at Bones ever played Final Fantasy VIII?Season 2 was not terrible.  I was happy to see some of the old characters return (Mao, July, April).  The ending was ridiculous, and it seemed that very slowly, the powers of contractors increased beyond reasonable belief (someone's power is that they can create worlds?).  Especially when said power is only introduced because the series needs to end somehow.The OVA's receive five stars for being exactly as the writers planned them to be: action-packed, character-deepening, gorgeous displays of chaotic violence.  Season 2 receives two stars for reasons previously mentioned, and the added fact that someone at Bones actually thought it was going to be a good show.",3,Season 2 is a waste of time.,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,2542,"['[', 'SLIGHT', 'SPOILERS', ']', 'are', 'actually', 'two', 'reviews', 'necessary', 'one', 'Season', '2', 'one', 'OVA', 'Concerning', 'OVA', 'are', 'excellent', 'plot', 'Hei', 'Yin', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'best', 'entire', 'series', 'animation', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'animators', 'tried', 'outdo', 'original', 'fight', 'scene', 'Season', '1', 'more', 'four', 'episodes', 'think', 'succeeded', 'Stream', 'OVA', 'enjoy', 'them.Season', '2', 'other', 'hand', 'simply', 'disaster', 'were', 'own', 'anime', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'mediocre', 'being', 'billed', 'follow-up', 'worthy', 'successor', 'Black', 'Contractor', 'simply', 'farce', 'times', 'seemed', 'Gemini', 'could', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'entirely', 'different', 'anime', 'so', 'altered', 'was', 'original', 'structure', 'DTB', 'Most', 'horrifying', 'Hei', 'complete', 'character', 'transformation', 'becoming', 'drunk', 'letting', 'facial', 'hair', 'grow', 'basically', 'looking', 'homeless', 'person', 'have', 'argued', 'transformation', 'character', 'flaws', 'such', 'argue', 'character', 'think', 'majority', 'audiences', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'Hei', 'OVA', 'continue', 'kicking', 'a**', 'Season', '2', 'am', 'Bones', 'dropped', 'ball', 'one.The', 'second', 'most', 'obvious', 'irritation', 'introduction', 'Suo', 'whole', 'training', 'situation', 'la', 'Professional', 'Suo', 'really', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'make', 'interested', 'slightest', 'not', 'mention', 'power', 'pulling', 'giant', 'piece', 'artillery', 'chest', 'power', 'especially', 'when', 'can', 'only', 'fire', 'couple', 'times', 'Furthermore', 'are', 'FORCED', 'TO', 'WATCH', 'THE', 'ANIMATION', 'OVER', 'AND', 'OVER', 'annoying', 'child', 'pulling', 'gun', 'chest', 'yes', 'animation', 'long', 'enough', 'become', 'tiresome', 'Had', 'one', 'Bones', 'ever', 'played', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VIII', 'Season', '2', 'was', 'not', 'terrible', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'old', 'characters', 'return', 'Mao', 'July', 'April', 'ending', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'seemed', 'very', 'slowly', 'powers', 'contractors', 'increased', 'reasonable', 'belief', 'someone', 'power', 'can', 'create', 'worlds', 'Especially', 'when', 'said', 'power', 'only', 'introduced', 'series', 'end', 'somehow.The', 'OVA', 'receive', 'five', 'stars', 'being', 'exactly', 'writers', 'planned', 'be', 'action-packed', 'character-deepening', 'gorgeous', 'displays', 'chaotic', 'violence', 'Season', '2', 'receives', 'two', 'stars', 'reasons', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'added', 'fact', 'someone', 'Bones', 'actually', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'show']",Darker Than Black: Gemini of Themeteor - Season 2

This first part will be a review of the 2nd seasons content and then a product review overall.The 2nd season follows after the OVA's left off where Hei is now in a stupor as he searches for Yin who was kidnapped, he arrives in Russia working for the CIA where he is sent to capture a boy named Shion.So the 2nd season of Darker than Black had a lot of hate given to it because of the confusion about what happened to Yin and Hei. Also many didn't like the introduction of a new character a young girl named Suou. This confusion was the result of many people not watching the OVA's between the 1st and 2nd season. This was critical because it explains what happened to Yin. Suou as a character was great or bad she was just along for the ride and this was meant to be because of event that happen in the story with the character Shion.Another important aspect of where people get confused is the fact that Darker than Black is following the Izanami/Izanagi/Kagutsuchi legend, which helps to explain what the over arching ideas of the story are and how the names correspond to the characters. Most believe that Hei is Izanagi, Yin is definitely Izanami, and the result of their being together would be Kagutsuchi. The last few being speculation by most viewers, but this helps to clarify their story and why Yin is changing from a normal doll to something elseOkay on to the actual product review, this version was perfect for someone who already owns the 1st season if it comes in a single DVD case because the chipboard case leaves room for the 1st season so all of it can be held in one box. Of course the issue being with the set though is if you don't have the first season than you have to keep the placeholder that comes with the box or else you'll have an empty space, but likely if you're buying this product than you already have the 1st season.This box has some great artwork, as well as the Blu rays and DVD have artwork on them that each was distinct and very nice to look at. I checked the quality of the 2nd season on Blu-Ray which looked great and I checked the OVA's on DVD which looked even better than the 1st season. There was no production drop off or budget cuts for this series.Overall i would give the box set a 5/5 for having a blu-ray and dvd combo, a great chipboard box, and great artwork. The OVA's are 4/5, and the 2nd season a 4/5 because while the show is highly enjoyable, the animation is great, there is the issue of not clarifying everyone's role throughout the series which would require re-watching the series once or twice to catch each important detail and make it clear.",4,Its good,1320796800,"11 9, 2011",2011,2763,"['will', 'review', 'give', 'reasons', 'why', '2nd', 'season', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'worthless', 'terms', 'story', 'most', 'people', 'try', 'make', 'out', 'be', 'first', 'part', 'will', 'be', 'review', '2nd', 'seasons', 'content', 'then', 'product', 'review', 'overall.The', '2nd', 'season', 'OVA', 'left', 'off', 'where', 'Hei', 'now', 'stupor', 'Yin', 'who', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'Russia', 'working', 'CIA', 'where', 'sent', 'capture', 'boy', 'named', 'Shion.So', '2nd', 'season', 'Darker', 'Black', 'had', 'lot', 'hate', 'given', 'confusion', 'what', 'happened', 'Yin', 'Hei', 'Also', 'many', 'did', ""n't"", 'introduction', 'new', 'character', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Suou', 'confusion', 'was', 'result', 'many', 'people', 'not', 'watching', 'OVA', '1st', '2nd', 'season', 'was', 'critical', 'what', 'happened', 'Yin', 'Suou', 'character', 'was', 'great', 'bad', 'was', 'just', 'along', 'ride', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'event', 'story', 'character', 'Shion.Another', 'important', 'aspect', 'where', 'people', 'get', 'confused', 'fact', 'Darker', 'Black', 'following', 'Izanami/Izanagi/Kagutsuchi', 'legend', 'explain', 'what', 'over', 'arching', 'ideas', 'story', 'are', 'how', 'names', 'correspond', 'characters', 'Most', 'believe', 'Hei', 'Izanagi', 'Yin', 'definitely', 'Izanami', 'result', 'being', 'together', 'would', 'be', 'Kagutsuchi', 'last', 'few', 'being', 'speculation', 'most', 'viewers', 'clarify', 'story', 'why', 'Yin', 'changing', 'normal', 'doll', 'something', 'elseOkay', 'actual', 'product', 'review', 'version', 'was', 'perfect', 'someone', 'who', 'already', '1st', 'season', 'single', 'DVD', 'case', 'chipboard', 'case', 'room', '1st', 'season', 'can', 'be', 'held', 'one', 'box', 'course', 'issue', 'being', 'set', 'though', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'first', 'season', 'have', 'keep', 'placeholder', 'box', 'else', ""'ll"", 'have', 'empty', 'space', 'likely', ""'re"", 'buying', 'product', 'already', 'have', '1st', 'season.This', 'box', 'great', 'artwork', 'as', 'well', 'Blu', 'rays', 'DVD', 'have', 'artwork', 'was', 'distinct', 'very', 'nice', 'look', 'checked', 'quality', '2nd', 'season', 'Blu-Ray', 'looked', 'great', 'checked', 'OVA', 'DVD', 'looked', 'even', 'better', '1st', 'season', 'was', 'production', 'drop', 'off', 'budget', 'cuts', 'series.Overall', 'i', 'would', 'give', 'box', 'set', '5/5', 'having', 'blu-ray', 'dvd', 'combo', 'great', 'chipboard', 'box', 'great', 'artwork', 'OVA', 'are', '4/5', '2nd', 'season', '4/5', 'show', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'animation', 'great', 'issue', 'not', 'clarifying', 'everyone', 'role', 'series', 'would', 'require', 're-watching', 'series', 'once', 'twice', 'catch', 'important', 'detail', 'make', 'clear']",Darker Than Black: Gemini of Themeteor - Season 2
1455363,A3TZSS69WBE0KB,B005DEUEOU,Msanimefreak,"[1, 2]","Ok, I had read plenty of reviews, and I own the First Season of Darker than Black, so when I heard about season 2, I was kinda nervous. This review wont have me describing the whole plot over to you, so scroll up if you need to know it. This is what I thought of the Second Season. This does contain some spoilers.This box set contains 4 OVA's that show what happens to Yin and Hei during the 2 year gap from season 1 and 2. It contains 2 commentaries, textless songs and previews for other animes. There are 5 discs, but 2 of them are for BluRay.Now, I read reviews, from this site and others saying that it wasn't as good as the first. I agree with most of that statement.*SPOILERS*: I loved this second season for multiple reasons:1. All the voice actors returned for their original role. Jason is still Hei and Briana is still Yin. John is still Mao and the British kid for the British boy doll is still the same actor as well. So I am pleased they recruited everyone for their characters.2. I'm not sure what everyone else was thinking, but the fight scenes are still bad ass. Yes, Hei does lose his powers in episode 3 or 4, not sure, but he still kicks ass, even tho he is a drunk and has too much hair on his head. I heard lots of people complaining that Hei sucks and he doesn't fight. Well you must have been watching the wrong anime because Hei was fighting in almost every episode and the fights were still as epic as season 1. In my opinion, he still kicks serious butt. And he does win most of those fights..3. Speaking of fights, the animation was absolutely stunning. Not a single sloppy episode.4. The new characters are not as bad as everyone says honestly. Suou (the main new character with the big ass gun),is annoying at times, and the fact that she fell for Hei is kinda sad and predictable. (And don't worry all the HeixYin fans, Hei doesn't go for Suou, she is like 12 years old and Hei loves Yin :) ) But there are new contractors with never before seen powers that really make Hei work to protect himself.5. And in my opinion, this second season was actually pretty good. I don't think it was particularly needed, they could have ended it after season 1 and that would have been good. But I thought it wasn't a bad sequel. It still had the suspense and edginess that season 1 had. Great music, some humor and like i said before, awesome fight scenes.6. The OVA's are pretty awesome. If you love Hei x Yin and like a little bit of a side story, focusing on the two love birds, you will love this addition to season 2. I may be bias because I am a hopeless romantic and a Hei x Yin fan, but I still think it was done well, and made sense.7. The ending was the only thing that i was a little disappointed in. Again, just like season 1, a very open ended ending. I would have liked to see the result of one situation in particular but I guess my imagination works just fine.Those are my personal thoughts about Darker than Black Season 2. I think if you have seen the first season, you should at least give the second season a chance. Don't buy it right away, check it out on youtube or hulu or something. But I think if you enjoyed season 1, you should at least give it a chance, and not turn away from it just because some people didn't like it. I was worried I wasn't going to like it, but I was surprised when I didn't just like it, I love season 2.***And for those who haven't seen season 1 and you are thinking about buying this season before the first, my strong recommendation is to watch 1 before 2, because you will be lost!***",5,**SPOILERS** Not as bad as I thought...,1314403200,"08 27, 2011",2011,3559,"['Ok', 'had', 'read', 'plenty', 'reviews', 'own', 'First', 'Season', 'Darker', 'Black', 'when', 'heard', 'season', '2', 'was', 'kinda', 'nervous', 'review', 'wont', 'have', 'describing', 'whole', 'plot', 'so', 'scroll', 'up', 'need', 'know', 'what', 'thought', 'Second', 'Season', 'contain', 'spoilers.This', 'box', 'set', '4', 'OVA', 'show', 'what', 'Yin', 'Hei', '2', 'year', 'gap', 'season', '1', '2', '2', 'commentaries', 'textless', 'songs', 'previews', 'other', 'animes', 'are', '5', 'discs', '2', 'are', 'BluRay.Now', 'read', 'reviews', 'site', 'others', 'saying', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'first', 'agree', 'most', 'statement', '*SPOILERS*', 'loved', 'second', 'season', 'multiple', 'reasons:1', 'voice', 'actors', 'returned', 'original', 'role', 'Jason', 'still', 'Hei', 'Briana', 'still', 'Yin', 'John', 'still', 'Mao', 'British', 'kid', 'British', 'boy', 'doll', 'still', 'same', 'actor', 'well', 'am', 'pleased', 'recruited', 'everyone', 'characters.2', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'thinking', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'still', 'bad', 'ass', 'Yes', 'Hei', 'lose', 'powers', 'episode', '3', '4', 'not', 'sure', 'still', 'ass', 'even', 'drunk', 'too', 'much', 'hair', 'head', 'heard', 'lots', 'people', 'complaining', 'Hei', 'sucks', ""n't"", 'fight', 'Well', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'wrong', 'anime', 'Hei', 'was', 'fighting', 'almost', 'episode', 'fights', 'were', 'still', 'as', 'epic', 'season', '1', 'opinion', 'still', 'serious', 'butt', 'win', 'most', 'fights..3', 'Speaking', 'fights', 'animation', 'was', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'Not', 'single', 'sloppy', 'episode.4', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'everyone', 'honestly', 'Suou', 'main', 'new', 'character', 'big', 'ass', 'gun', 'annoying', 'times', 'fact', 'fell', 'Hei', 'kinda', 'sad', 'predictable', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'HeixYin', 'fans', 'Hei', ""n't"", 'go', 'Suou', '12', 'years', 'old', 'Hei', 'Yin', 'are', 'new', 'contractors', 'never', 'seen', 'powers', 'really', 'make', 'Hei', 'work', 'protect', 'himself.5', 'opinion', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'particularly', 'needed', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'season', '1', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'sequel', 'still', 'had', 'suspense', 'edginess', 'season', '1', 'had', 'Great', 'music', 'humor', 'i', 'said', 'awesome', 'fight', 'scenes.6', 'OVA', 'are', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'love', 'Hei', 'x', 'Yin', 'little', 'bit', 'side', 'story', 'focusing', 'two', 'love', 'birds', 'will', 'love', 'addition', 'season', '2', 'may', 'be', 'bias', 'am', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'Hei', 'x', 'Yin', 'fan', 'still', 'think', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'made', 'sense.7', 'ending', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'i', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'Again', 'just', 'season', '1', 'very', 'open', 'ended', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'result', 'one', 'situation', 'particular', 'guess', 'imagination', 'just', 'fine.Those', 'are', 'personal', 'thoughts', 'Darker', 'Black', 'Season', '2', 'think', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'season', 'should', 'least', 'give', 'second', 'season', 'chance', 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'right', 'away', 'check', 'out', 'youtube', 'hulu', 'something', 'think', 'enjoyed', 'season', '1', 'should', 'least', 'give', 'chance', 'not', 'turn', 'away', 'just', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'worried', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'like', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'love', 'season', '2', '***And', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'season', '1', 'are', 'thinking', 'buying', 'season', 'first', 'strong', 'recommendation', 'watch', '1', '2', 'will', 'be', 'lost', '***']",Darker Than Black: Gemini of Themeteor - Season 2
1455364,A3GXZCPKNUANBC,B005DEUEOU,Polka loves Polka Dancing,"[1, 1]","Darker than black has to be one of the best series ever. It's got great action and I don't know anyone who has seen it and not loved the series. I loved the OVAs which I didn't I get to see completed before now. They should really be watched between season 1 and 2 not after season 2, since they are the lost story of what happened in between the two. The main thing that season 2 lacks compared to season 1 is a lot of intrigue. There is still plenty of action, but it's more of a survival vs. finding out the truth sort of plot line.Additionally I'm stuck with blu rays discs that I will never be able to use. So I would much rather save a few bucks and have the choice of buying only the discs I want. I'm really getting annoyed at Funimation's packaging of both dvds and blu rays together. Especially since they didn't do it for the first season. It's a total rip off and if I hadn't already seen and loved Darker than Black, I wouldn't take a chance on a series that is a combo, like I do with a lot of the S.A.V.Es.",4,Still awesome but not as good as season 1,1333843200,"04 8, 2012",2012,1021,"['Darker', 'black', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'ever', 'got', 'great', 'action', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'not', 'loved', 'series', 'loved', 'OVAs', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'completed', 'before', 'now', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'watched', 'season', '1', '2', 'not', 'season', '2', 'are', 'lost', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'two', 'main', 'thing', 'season', '2', 'lacks', 'compared', 'season', '1', 'lot', 'intrigue', 'still', 'plenty', 'action', 'more', 'survival', 'vs.', 'finding', 'out', 'truth', 'sort', 'plot', 'line.Additionally', ""'m"", 'stuck', 'blu', 'rays', 'discs', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'use', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'save', 'few', 'bucks', 'have', 'choice', 'buying', 'only', 'discs', 'want', ""'m"", 'really', 'getting', 'annoyed', 'Funimation', 'packaging', 'dvds', 'blu', 'rays', 'together', 'Especially', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'first', 'season', 'total', 'rip', 'had', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'loved', 'Darker', 'Black', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'chance', 'series', 'combo', 'do', 'lot', 'S.A.V.Es']",Darker Than Black: Gemini of Themeteor - Season 2
1455365,A1AQ477HH3KQ8P,B005DEUEOU,RavenRing,"[14, 20]","2 years have passed since the events in the first season. Suo Pavlichenko is a teenage girl living in Russia with her scientist father and Contractor brother, whose life is turned upside down one day when her father is murdered, his lab destroyed, and her brother disappears. On the run from several different factions who mistake her for her brother, Suou teams up with Hei to get to Tokyo to find her mother.I have mixed feelings about this series. I loved the first season, so I started with high expectations. It still had many of the elements that I loved in the first season - mysteries, characters with unknown agendas, Hei - but it also shifted its focus a little by making Suo the main character. This season has more teenage angst then the first, and Suo is kind of annoying. She also has a boring transforming type sequence the animators loved. Hei has gone through some trauma that isn't really explained (though I hear it is explained in the OVA), and he spends the series working back up to his former cool self.But he does work out of his depression. Suo starts to grow up. Mao is a flying squirrel. And the somewhat mediocre story works up to a sufficiently mind bending ending. I did enjoy this season, but most of it was brightened by my love of the first series. If you really loved the first series, you might enjoy seeing the second just for more Darker Than Black. Or you might just want to stop while you are ahead, and leave your memories of Darker Than Black at the end of the first season.This series is a nice length, at just 12 episodes, which is long enough for some interesting things to happen, and short enough that Suo can't drive you insane. I still can't say whether or not I recommend it though.PS The OVA is 4 episodes long, but I haven't seen it.
