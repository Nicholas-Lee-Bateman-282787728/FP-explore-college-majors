My favorite episode so far is from Season four with Cousin Gerard. He is the same guy who played the loudmouth pharmacist on 'The Nanny' with Fran Drescher. Cousin Gerard is neurotic and a hypochondriac. The fact that Raymond seems annoyed with him even though his whole family thinks he acts JUST LIKE Gerard makes that particular episode all the more hilarious!!I love this show and I plan to buy ALL seasons!!!,5,Love this sitcom!,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,521,"['Did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'ELR', 'started', 'watching', 'reruns', 'TVLand', 'TBS', 'show', 'hilarious', 'favorite', 'episode', 'far', 'Season', 'four', 'Cousin', 'Gerard', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'loudmouth', 'pharmacist', 'Nanny', 'Fran', 'Drescher', 'Cousin', 'Gerard', 'neurotic', 'hypochondriac', 'fact', 'Raymond', 'annoyed', 'even', 'whole', 'family', 'JUST', 'LIKE', 'Gerard', 'particular', 'episode', 'more', 'hilarious', 'love', 'show', 'plan', 'buy', 'ALL', 'seasons']",N/A

Mann ""The Professor""","[10, 10]","Bravo to HBO video, for reducing the price of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" to the point where season box sets can be sold as two-packs.  I first saw this at my local Target store. Got most of the seasons there, and seasons 3-4 here at Amazon, to further my collection.  My seller did a fine job of getting it to me sooner than I expected.  The condition was as good as promised, and the joy of both hearing commentaries, and seeing deleted scenes puts DVD ownership over the tube anytime.  Even on my low-res TV, the quality is pristine, and the inclusion of a TV museum event where the cast and crew appeared is a bonus for anybody as interested in the creators of this show, as well as the actors.  (Not since the Dick Van Dyke show, have I seen a show work the way ""Raymond"" did.)
