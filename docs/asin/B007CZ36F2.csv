Its about a girl living in her past a lot and taking up surfing. Some of the acting is really very good I must say just a pity the story is so slow and the surfing rather beginner level throughout.,3,Not quite soul surfer level,1339459200,"06 12, 2012",2012,322,"['watched', 'Soul', 'surfer', 'will', 'be', 'bored', 'pace', 'slow', 'comparison', 'have', 'not', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'ok.', 'girl', 'living', 'past', 'lot', 'taking', 'up', 'surfing', 'acting', 'really', 'very', 'good', 'must', 'say', 'just', 'pity', 'story', 'so', 'slow', 'surfing', 'rather', 'beginner', 'level']",Beautiful Wave
1530006,A2582KMXLK2P06,B007CZ36F2,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Beautiful Wave has flaws all over the place.  It's one major flaw!  It's about a teenage girl who apparently lacks motivation and has low self-esteem.  She has to find a way to spend her precious time, so... she hooks up with a couple surfer guys, takes a trip to the ocean, learns how to ride the waves by herself because the guys are too busy flirting with other girls to really teach her anything, and this results in a large chunk of the storyline being downright boring, miserable and uninteresting.  It's a really awful film.The only enticing part is when the gang ends up crossing the border and has to deal with a couple barely understandable border patrolmen who'd like nothing more than to arrest a bunch of kids that certainly look like they're up to no good.  Right from the get go you can tell it's a low budget movie because there's an eerie silence in the background in between lines that makes it feel more like a high school play.So what IS this supposed to be about?  The girl is supposed to travel around with a map to uncover family secrets but trust me, there's NO adventure occurring whatsoever.  At least, not during the first half when practically nothing at all happens.  Beautiful Wave is too bland and doesn't deliver a worthwhile enough storyline to contain any adventure.

Since that time she's had a fear of water, even though she is a great swimmer, and spends most of her time wrapped in a book.She slowly begins to warm to her free spirited grandmother, whose own husband never came back from Vietnam.On beknown to the two women, the grandfather Jimmy (Lance Henriksen of Pumpkinhead) is alive living far down in Mexico where he and a comrade save sea turtles from pouchers.The grandmother gives an old 1962 surf van to Nicole, that belonged to the grandfather she never knew. Armed with that, a map that shows surfing locations including one called Beautiful Wave, loads up with three friends and begins an adventure.The crew includes Kayla (Alicia Ziegler) the surf shop manager, who helps the grandmother, Jeff (Ben Milliken) who has a thing for Nicole and Danny (David Thomas Jenkins), Jeff's best friend and the bad boy of the bunch.Most guys will find Beautiful Wave boring.

Nicole (Teegarden) is sent by her mom to Santa Cruz for the summer to live with her grandmother. At first she resents the fact that she has to go but soon changes her mind after meeting new friends...and the sport of surfing. After watching ""Soul Surfer"" I was actually more excited to see this then I normally would have been. I knew it wasn't going to be like that but I wasn't looking forward to ""Soul Surfer"" the first time either and that surprised me with how good it was. After 20 minutes I realized how wrong I was in my expectations. For those that have seen the movie ""Surfer, Dude"" this is more comparable to that one then this one. No real plot to speak of, or really surfing for that matter. Again though I know this movie is not made for me so I may be being to hard on it but to me this was boring and seemed to have no point. Although if I was a teenage girl I may feel different about it. Overall, a movie that I thought was boring but also it wasn't made for me.

The problem is simple: the script. The story is contrived and implausible. Paper-thin characters make unnatural decisions just to keep the plot going. Heavy-handed direction from David Mueller doesn't help.The photography is beautiful and the surf scenes are decent if not outstanding, but to make a more emotionally involving drama we need something more than that.",2,Surf Movie?
