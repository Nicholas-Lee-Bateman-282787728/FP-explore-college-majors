What actually drew me into watching it was finding out that Michael Chiklis plays Curly. A great actor, Chiklis played in TV shows as a good guy inThe Commishfrom the 80's-90's and then later as a bad guy in the controversial showThe Shieldmuch later.This story of the 3 Stooges is told from the point of view of Moe, as the head of the trio and the one trying to make the best career decisions for the group. It gives an insight into the struggles they went through on their way to the top.There is so much to the Stooges story that the film spends just a short time on each area of their career/life. There are times when I felt large parts were being jumped over, and by doing some online searching of their film career my suspicions were right. While I understand not everything can be included, there were definitely areas that perhaps a bit more story could have been told. Like how Ted Healy and the Stooges started working together, maybe more on Larry's gambling addiction and how Curly's strokes that lead to his death was not just a single one, but a series of them over the years.Also I found myself lost when they started bringing in characters after Shemp's death. The film moved so fast that anyone not already familiar with 3 Stooges history (like I was not) is left wondering what just happened and how they ended up with the replacement stooges they were working with.I believe they chose to cover a lot of the Stooges history with this film by doing many small bits of story for each area. Other than being left with a few more in depth questions about their careers, it's a good movie that gives those of us totally unfamiliar with the 3 Stooges history a glimpse into how they become the stars they were",4,The story you never knew about the 3 Stooges,1319500800,"10 25, 2011",2011,1793,"['watching', 'had', 'idea', 'history', '3', 'Stooges', 'What', 'actually', 'drew', 'watching', 'was', 'finding', 'out', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'Curly', 'A', 'great', 'actor', 'Chiklis', 'played', 'TV', 'shows', 'good', 'guy', 'inThe', 'Commishfrom', ""80's-90"", 'then', 'later', 'bad', 'guy', 'controversial', 'showThe', 'Shieldmuch', 'story', '3', 'Stooges', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'Moe', 'head', 'trio', 'one', 'trying', 'make', 'best', 'career', 'decisions', 'group', 'insight', 'struggles', 'went', 'way', 'top.There', 'so', 'much', 'Stooges', 'story', 'film', 'just', 'short', 'time', 'area', 'career/life', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'felt', 'large', 'parts', 'were', 'being', 'jumped', 'doing', 'online', 'searching', 'film', 'career', 'suspicions', 'were', 'right', 'understand', 'not', 'everything', 'can', 'be', 'included', 'were', 'definitely', 'areas', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'more', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'how', 'Ted', 'Healy', 'Stooges', 'started', 'working', 'together', 'maybe', 'more', 'Larry', 'gambling', 'addiction', 'how', 'Curly', 'strokes', 'lead', 'death', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'single', 'one', 'series', 'years.Also', 'found', 'lost', 'when', 'started', 'bringing', 'characters', 'Shemp', 'death', 'film', 'moved', 'so', 'fast', 'anyone', 'not', 'already', 'familiar', '3', 'Stooges', 'history', 'was', 'not', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'just', 'happened', 'how', 'ended', 'up', 'replacement', 'were', 'working', 'with.I', 'believe', 'chose', 'cover', 'lot', 'Stooges', 'history', 'film', 'doing', 'many', 'small', 'bits', 'story', 'area', 'Other', 'being', 'left', 'few', 'more', 'depth', 'questions', 'careers', 'good', 'movie', 'totally', 'unfamiliar', '3', 'Stooges', 'history', 'glimpse', 'how', 'become', 'stars', 'were']",N/A
871074,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B0006MTZOY,Anyechka,"[5, 6]","Like a lot of other biopics, this one is no exception in that there's a lot more fiction than fact.  Most of the basic facts are correct, but there are also a great many errors, character assassinations, and events that are either depicted as happening differently than they really did or cut and pasted with other events.  For the casual viewer, this will probably seem like a great movie, but for those who are more serious fans, it's going to be a lot harder to take.  While it's true that most movies based on books aren't 100% true to the original, nor should they be expected to, given the limited amount of time to tell the story, this is more of an inexcusable thing when the movie is actually based on the lives of real people.  Casual fans aren't going to know or care about things like when such and such a director began working at Columbia, that the sound effects are wrong, or who was the head of the short subjects department when the Stooges began working at Columbia; if only nitpicking details like that were the only errors here, it wouldn't have been so bad.The biopic was based on Michael Fleming's book 'From Amalgamated Morons to American Icons,' a book which also isn't 100% accurate (which in actual fact has some embarrassing errors), but which still has a lot more fact than this biopic.  The biopic doesn't even follow all of the events the way they're outlined in Fleming's book.  The real story of these men is fascinating enough, so why does it need to have so many liberties taken and so much pathos inserted to try to make it appeal to a wider audience?  Additionally, an hour and a half is hardly enough time to tell the story of an entire career; perhaps less important events would have been left out and less time glossed over had this biopic been at least a two-parter.There are too many errors and omissions to get into here, but some of the more important ones are the character assassinations (Ted Healy may have had some problems with drinking and didn't really pay the boys enough money, but he was far from the complete monster he was depicted as here, and Shemp may have had a lot of phobias, but he was far from the cowardly crybaby the movie shows him as; he was actually the one who was the least afraid of getting hurt), the fact that the boys are more or less always acting in character, even offscreen (when in actual fact there was a really interesting, and even quite touching, contrast between their screen personae and their real-life personalities; for example, Moe was an incredibly nice guy in real life, the complete opposite of the short-tempered bully he portrayed), Curly is shown as having minor strokes as early as 1940 (and the circumstances of his major stroke in 1946 are all wrong; he did not have a stroke while the cameras were rolling), the perpetuation of the apocryphal legend about Joe DeRita being the new Stooge of choice after Shemp died, the Shemp era itself being glossed over in the blink of an eye (one minute they're shooting 'Fright Night' and the next he's in a coffin!), how the three youngest Horwitz brothers are shown performing onstage together as kids in the opening scene and doing bits of their act (the three brothers who got into show business never were onstage together as kids, and weren't even doing stuff like hitting one another until years later), and the fact that the entire premise of the movie makes no sense (since by April of 1959, they already knew they were on the comeback trail, so it makes no sense for Moe to want to refuse to appear before an audience again).  The recreations of the shorts also come across very badly and inaccurately.  Oh, and I don't think that Mabel Fine was a stripper.  She was a dancer, but not the exotic type.As I've said, this does seem like a really good movie and a nice way to pass some time if you're just a casual viewer or a new fan, but if you're more of a hardcore fan, you're liable to be distracted and angered by all of the inaccuracies.  And since there was so much pathos in this movie, it's baffling as to why they left out some very poignant events or portrayed them differently (such as their reactions to hearing Ted Healy had been murdered, or the real circumstances of Curly's stroke).  Although I will give this biopic credit for depicting how they were exploited by Columbia and never given a raise for like 25 years, something I don't think many casual fans are really aware of.  I'll admit that there are some accurate things in it and some moments I did find moving, but overall, it comes across as more of an insult than a tribute.",2,A typical biopic,1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,4597,"['lot', 'other', 'biopics', 'one', 'exception', 'lot', 'more', 'fiction', 'fact', 'Most', 'basic', 'facts', 'are', 'correct', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'many', 'errors', 'character', 'assassinations', 'events', 'are', 'either', 'depicted', 'happening', 'differently', 'really', 'did', 'cut', 'pasted', 'other', 'events', 'casual', 'viewer', 'will', 'probably', 'seem', 'great', 'movie', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'serious', 'fans', 'going', 'be', 'lot', 'harder', 'take', 'true', 'most', 'movies', 'based', 'books', 'are', ""n't"", '100', '%', 'true', 'original', 'should', 'be', 'expected', 'given', 'limited', 'amount', 'time', 'tell', 'story', 'more', 'inexcusable', 'thing', 'when', 'movie', 'actually', 'based', 'lives', 'real', 'people', 'Casual', 'fans', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'know', 'care', 'things', 'when', 'such', 'such', 'director', 'began', 'working', 'Columbia', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'wrong', 'who', 'was', 'head', 'short', 'subjects', 'department', 'when', 'Stooges', 'began', 'working', 'Columbia', 'only', 'nitpicking', 'details', 'were', 'only', 'errors', 'here', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'so', 'bad.The', 'biopic', 'was', 'based', 'Michael', 'Fleming', 'book', ""'From"", 'Amalgamated', 'Morons', 'American', 'Icons', 'book', 'also', ""n't"", '100', '%', 'accurate', 'actual', 'fact', 'embarrassing', 'errors', 'still', 'lot', 'more', 'fact', 'biopic', 'biopic', ""n't"", 'even', 'follow', 'events', 'way', ""'re"", 'outlined', 'Fleming', 'book', 'real', 'story', 'men', 'fascinating', 'enough', 'so', 'why', 'need', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'liberties', 'taken', 'so', 'much', 'pathos', 'inserted', 'try', 'make', 'appeal', 'wider', 'audience', 'Additionally', 'hour', 'half', 'hardly', 'enough', 'time', 'tell', 'story', 'entire', 'career', 'perhaps', 'less', 'important', 'events', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'less', 'time', 'glossed', 'had', 'biopic', 'been', 'least', 'two-parter.There', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'errors', 'omissions', 'get', 'here', 'more', 'important', 'ones', 'are', 'character', 'assassinations', 'Ted', 'Healy', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'problems', 'drinking', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'pay', 'boys', 'enough', 'money', 'was', 'far', 'complete', 'monster', 'was', 'depicted', 'here', 'Shemp', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'lot', 'phobias', 'was', 'far', 'cowardly', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'least', 'afraid', 'getting', 'hurt', 'fact', 'boys', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'always', 'acting', 'character', 'even', 'offscreen', 'when', 'actual', 'fact', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'even', 'quite', 'touching', 'contrast', 'screen', 'personae', 'real-life', 'personalities', 'example', 'Moe', 'was', 'incredibly', 'nice', 'guy', 'real', 'life', 'complete', 'opposite', 'short-tempered', 'bully', 'portrayed', 'Curly', 'shown', 'having', 'minor', 'strokes', 'as', 'early', '1940', 'circumstances', 'major', 'stroke', '1946', 'are', 'wrong', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'stroke', 'cameras', 'were', 'rolling', 'perpetuation', 'apocryphal', 'legend', 'Joe', 'DeRita', 'being', 'new', 'Stooge', 'choice', 'Shemp', 'died', 'Shemp', 'era', 'being', 'glossed', 'blink', 'eye', 'one', 'minute', ""'re"", 'shooting', ""'Fright"", 'Night', 'next', 'coffin', 'how', 'three', 'youngest', 'Horwitz', 'brothers', 'are', 'shown', 'performing', 'onstage', 'together', 'kids', 'opening', 'scene', 'doing', 'bits', 'act', 'three', 'brothers', 'who', 'got', 'show', 'business', 'never', 'were', 'onstage', 'together', 'kids', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'doing', 'stuff', 'hitting', 'one', 'years', 'later', 'fact', 'entire', 'premise', 'movie', 'sense', 'April', '1959', 'already', 'knew', 'were', 'comeback', 'trail', 'sense', 'Moe', 'want', 'refuse', 'appear', 'audience', 'again', 'recreations', 'shorts', 'also', 'come', 'very', 'badly', 'inaccurately', 'Oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Mabel', 'Fine', 'was', 'stripper', 'was', 'dancer', 'not', 'exotic', 'type.As', ""'ve"", 'said', 'seem', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'nice', 'way', 'pass', 'time', ""'re"", 'just', 'casual', 'viewer', 'new', 'fan', ""'re"", 'more', 'hardcore', 'fan', ""'re"", 'liable', 'be', 'distracted', 'angered', 'inaccuracies', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'pathos', 'movie', 'baffling', 'why', 'left', 'out', 'very', 'poignant', 'events', 'portrayed', 'differently', 'such', 'reactions', 'hearing', 'Ted', 'Healy', 'had', 'been', 'murdered', 'real', 'circumstances', 'Curly', 'stroke', 'will', 'give', 'biopic', 'credit', 'depicting', 'how', 'were', 'exploited', 'Columbia', 'never', 'given', 'raise', '25', 'years', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'many', 'casual', 'fans', 'are', 'really', 'aware', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'are', 'accurate', 'things', 'moments', 'did', 'find', 'moving', 'overall', 'more', 'insult', 'tribute']",N/A
