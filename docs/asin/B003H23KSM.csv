1345521,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B003H23KSM,Howard M. Kindel,"[7, 10]","Since Jason Bermas now seems to be affiliated with Alex Jones, it would behoove Mr Jones to take a page from his new associate's playbook.  Not to say that this is a better film in terms of technique, editing, etc; only that there's almost nothing extraneous to the main thrust of ""Invisible Empire"" - whereas, in most Alex Jones documentaries, there's so much superfluous data that it's difficult to concentrate on the main theme.  Mr Bermas takes things slowly, building a truly impressive case against those bent on creating and overseeing the by now infamous ""New World Order.""  His method is inductive in that he begins with the general - the widest possible collection of elites having a common interest in this ""New World Order;"" then proceeds to slowly narrow his focus, ending with the specific - the smallest collection of ""New World Order"" elites.  He moves from the League of Nations to the United Nations to the Council on Foreign Relations to the Tri-Lateral Commision and, finally, to his mentor Alex Jones' great bugaboo, the Bilderberg Group - and, in the process, he makes an excellent case for this shadowy Group being not only a great menace to humanity but an almost omnipotent ruling body of most of the world already.  An excellent case - but not an air-tight case.Bermas' ""Achilles Heel"" is his insistence, a la Alex Jones, that climate change and, particularly, man-made global warming is nothing but a gigantic hoax perpetrated on humanity by the purveyors of the ""New World Order"" so as to establish a world-wide ""Carbon Tax"" as a seemingly rational pretext for world domination.  All he offers as his proof for this bombshell is a couple scientists' admission of having falsified their data to show that global warming was real, plus the vague assertion that there have been far greater concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere at various times in the past and yet life flourished.  Of course it flourished: life will flourish in one form or another under almost any condition; but not human life.Another thing heavily focused on in Bermas' work, once again a la Alex Jones, is the virtual metamorphosis of America The Free into America The Police State. And he provides ample evidence to back up this contention.  My only reservation with this assessment is simply that, historically, the United States - like every other nation-state that exists or ever did exist - has always been a police state to some extent.  Turn any page from our history and you'll find some or another group - especially minority group - being oppressed by the force of the state or community.  The Rule of Law practically guarantees it.  It's just a matter of degree.  And Bermas, to his credit, makes clear that that ""degree"" is fast approaching 100%.",5,Listen Up Alex Jones!,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,2757,"['Jason', 'Bermas', 'now', 'be', 'affiliated', 'Alex', 'Jones', 'would', 'behoove', 'Mr', 'Jones', 'take', 'page', 'new', 'associate', 'playbook', 'Not', 'say', 'better', 'film', 'terms', 'technique', 'editing', 'etc', 'only', 'almost', 'nothing', 'extraneous', 'main', 'thrust', 'Invisible', 'Empire', 'whereas', 'most', 'Alex', 'Jones', 'documentaries', 'so', 'much', 'superfluous', 'data', 'difficult', 'concentrate', 'main', 'theme', 'Mr', 'Bermas', 'things', 'slowly', 'building', 'truly', 'impressive', 'case', 'bent', 'creating', 'overseeing', 'now', 'infamous', 'New', 'World', 'Order', 'method', 'inductive', 'general', 'widest', 'possible', 'collection', 'elites', 'having', 'common', 'interest', 'New', 'World', 'Order', 'then', 'slowly', 'narrow', 'focus', 'ending', 'specific', 'smallest', 'collection', 'New', 'World', 'Order', 'League', 'Nations', 'United', 'Nations', 'Council', 'Foreign', 'Relations', 'Tri-Lateral', 'Commision', 'finally', 'mentor', 'Alex', 'Jones', 'great', 'bugaboo', 'Bilderberg', 'Group', 'process', 'excellent', 'case', 'shadowy', 'Group', 'being', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'menace', 'humanity', 'almost', 'omnipotent', 'ruling', 'body', 'most', 'world', 'already', 'excellent', 'case', 'not', 'air-tight', 'case.Bermas', 'Achilles', 'Heel', 'insistence', 'la', 'Alex', 'Jones', 'climate', 'change', 'particularly', 'man-made', 'global', 'warming', 'nothing', 'gigantic', 'hoax', 'perpetrated', 'humanity', 'purveyors', 'New', 'World', 'Order', 'so', 'establish', 'world-wide', 'Carbon', 'Tax', 'seemingly', 'rational', 'pretext', 'world', 'domination', 'proof', 'bombshell', 'couple', 'scientists', 'admission', 'having', 'falsified', 'data', 'show', 'global', 'warming', 'was', 'real', 'vague', 'assertion', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'greater', 'concentrations', 'CO2', 'atmosphere', 'various', 'times', 'past', 'yet', 'life', 'flourished', 'course', 'flourished', 'life', 'will', 'flourish', 'one', 'form', 'almost', 'condition', 'not', 'human', 'life.Another', 'thing', 'heavily', 'focused', 'Bermas', 'work', 'once', 'again', 'la', 'Alex', 'Jones', 'virtual', 'metamorphosis', 'America', 'Free', 'America', 'Police', 'State', 'ample', 'evidence', 'back', 'up', 'contention', 'only', 'reservation', 'assessment', 'simply', 'historically', 'United', 'States', 'other', 'nation-state', 'ever', 'did', 'exist', 'always', 'been', 'police', 'state', 'extent', 'Turn', 'page', 'history', ""'ll"", 'find', 'group', 'especially', 'minority', 'group', 'being', 'oppressed', 'force', 'state', 'community', 'Rule', 'Law', 'practically', 'just', 'matter', 'degree', 'Bermas', 'credit', 'clear', 'degree', 'fast', 'approaching', '100', '%']",Invisible Empire: A New World Order Defined

This is a fantastic and powerful film to show a skeptical friend or family member who equates the term ""New World Order"" to a crazy conspiracy theory. There's a lot of information here, and that's both good and bad. It's good because it shows how deep this all goes. It's bad because there isn't enough time for it all to be dealt with in detail. But then again, there is no DVD or even DVD series that could come close to covering the wealth of evidence of true conspiracies against the American public that exist. As I said, this is an excellent introduction.

1345523,AQS7029ZUSTUR,B003H23KSM,Keeping It Real,"[28, 46]","I'll start by saying that I'm all about the conspiracies. I know they exist and they're major. So, when I say this documentary was disappointing, it isn't because I'm against the idea. It had a lot of great, essential information in it, but also a lot to be disappointed in.Bottom line: Despite it's great exposures, the documentary seemed a-little unbalanced and lacked support and evidence for some important assertions. Honestly, I think you're better off buying books on the subject from experts. This documentary is better than nothing, but, if you choose to get it, keep your brain working and watch it critically.Here are some example of what I didn't like, in order of appearance:1) this is the most trivial complaint, but it does bug me so I'll mention it. Invisible Empire opens essentially as an infomercial for ""Loose Change"". I guess the way I feel is that if I wanted Loose Change I would've bought it. If Jason impresses me, of course I would seek out his other projects. No need to sell. When I first watched this movie, I was forgiving of this, expecting to find a great documentary. But, after my overall disappointment, I'm now irritated by this unnecessary bragging. Loose Change wasn't even written or directed by Chris - it was written and directed by Dylan Avery. Chris was only one of 3 producers.2) When he lists people that are involved with the controlling organizations discussed in the documentary, they are immediately given the evil eye as though they are among the root of the evil. But, as much as I like exposing corruption, I don't think EVERYONE that is involved in these organizations are corrupt, not even Oprah (as implied by the video). Most, sure, but not all. The powers that be are immense. It's unfair to assume anyone that's involved is in it for greed. Often, people in powerful positions don't have a choice but to become involved. Alternatively, some good people will go where the evil is, so they can learn what they need to know to help make POSITIVE changes at another place and time.3) If you watch carefully, the documentary actually contradicts itself. On the one hand, it condemns the New World Order (NWO) as a single group of power hungy individuals set on taking over the world. But then it condems Obama when he says that no single group should be in control of everything. They condemn his comment because the filmmakers seem to view equality among nations as bad?? If Obama thinks no single group should be in control of everything, that certainly applies to the power hungry NWO. So why are the filmmakers upset with his statement? We WANT multiple nations in peace and equality, right? Not the single nation of the NWO. Right??4) Chris says that global warming is not real but a threat CREATED as a way to gain control. Whether you think global warming is man made or not doesn't matter. Both sides of the debate generally agree that global warming exists. But Chris says it doesn't even exist. Given that it DOES exist, it's reasonable to try and minimize the problems we may encounter from it. In this case, political power is useful - even with the creation of new taxes. Carbon tax is insentive for companies to be responsible, therefore, I don't see a problem with it. This documentary is not the place to take up the battle of global warming, but it tries, and it does not do it well. Chris looses tremendous credibility with me here. Especially when he says that people are calling carbon dioxide ""toxic"". But nobody is saying this. It is only said that carbon dioxide TRAPS HEAT. Glass is not toxic, but it traps heat. That's why they use glass for greenhouses and why CO2 is called a ""greenhouse gas"", not a toxic gas. Where did he get this ""toxic"" bit?5) Chris says that there is no population problem on our planet. But because some politicians have publicly stated that there IS a population problem, he insists that it's just another thing the government is making up to control us. But our populations ARE too high. Even in the US, and even though it's been declining. It's been an interest of mine that I've researched and can argue about. He has no justification to say there isn't a population problem. It doesn't take much to learn about it. This is another fight he should have left alone because he is wrong. We don't even need to take global warming into account to recognize the need to stablize our populations. And, think about it, the government gains money from MORE people paying taxes, not less. It's, therefore, against their financial interest to minimize the population. Think about it.I know we all like conspiracies and to see corruption exposed, but let's not get carried away.",2,Get a book instead,1314576000,"08 29, 2011",2011,4674,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'saying', ""'m"", 'conspiracies', 'know', 'exist', ""'re"", 'major', 'So', 'when', 'say', 'documentary', 'was', 'disappointing', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'idea', 'had', 'lot', 'great', 'essential', 'information', 'also', 'lot', 'be', 'disappointed', 'in.Bottom', 'line', 'great', 'exposures', 'documentary', 'seemed', 'a-little', 'unbalanced', 'lacked', 'support', 'evidence', 'important', 'assertions', 'Honestly', 'think', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'buying', 'books', 'subject', 'experts', 'documentary', 'better', 'nothing', 'choose', 'get', 'keep', 'brain', 'working', 'watch', 'are', 'example', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'order', 'appearance:1', 'most', 'trivial', 'complaint', 'bug', 'so', ""'ll"", 'mention', 'Invisible', 'Empire', 'essentially', 'infomercial', 'Loose', 'Change', 'guess', 'way', 'feel', 'wanted', 'Loose', 'Change', 'would', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'Jason', 'course', 'would', 'seek', 'out', 'other', 'projects', 'need', 'sell', 'When', 'first', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'forgiving', 'expecting', 'find', 'great', 'documentary', 'overall', 'disappointment', ""'m"", 'now', 'irritated', 'unnecessary', 'bragging', 'Loose', 'Change', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'written', 'directed', 'Chris', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Dylan', 'Avery', 'Chris', 'was', 'only', 'one', '3', 'producers.2', 'When', 'people', 'are', 'involved', 'controlling', 'organizations', 'discussed', 'documentary', 'are', 'immediately', 'given', 'evil', 'eye', 'are', 'root', 'evil', 'as', 'much', 'like', 'exposing', 'corruption', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'EVERYONE', 'involved', 'organizations', 'are', 'corrupt', 'not', 'even', 'Oprah', 'implied', 'video', 'Most', 'sure', 'not', 'powers', 'be', 'are', 'immense', 'unfair', 'assume', 'anyone', 'involved', 'greed', 'Often', 'people', 'powerful', 'positions', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'choice', 'become', 'involved', 'Alternatively', 'good', 'people', 'will', 'go', 'where', 'evil', 'can', 'learn', 'what', 'need', 'know', 'help', 'make', 'POSITIVE', 'changes', 'place', 'time.3', 'watch', 'carefully', 'documentary', 'actually', 'one', 'hand', 'New', 'World', 'Order', 'NWO', 'single', 'group', 'power', 'hungy', 'individuals', 'set', 'taking', 'over', 'world', 'then', 'Obama', 'when', 'single', 'group', 'should', 'be', 'control', 'everything', 'condemn', 'comment', 'filmmakers', 'seem', 'view', 'equality', 'nations', 'bad', 'Obama', 'single', 'group', 'should', 'be', 'control', 'everything', 'certainly', 'power', 'hungry', 'NWO', 'So', 'why', 'are', 'filmmakers', 'upset', 'statement', 'WANT', 'multiple', 'nations', 'peace', 'equality', 'right', 'Not', 'single', 'nation', 'NWO', 'Right', '4', 'Chris', 'global', 'warming', 'not', 'real', 'threat', 'CREATED', 'way', 'gain', 'control', 'think', 'global', 'warming', 'man', 'made', 'not', ""n't"", 'matter', 'sides', 'debate', 'generally', 'agree', 'global', 'warming', 'exists', 'Chris', ""n't"", 'even', 'exist', 'Given', 'DOES', 'exist', 'reasonable', 'try', 'minimize', 'problems', 'may', 'encounter', 'case', 'political', 'power', 'useful', 'even', 'creation', 'new', 'taxes', 'Carbon', 'tax', 'insentive', 'companies', 'be', 'responsible', 'therefore', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'problem', 'documentary', 'not', 'place', 'take', 'up', 'battle', 'global', 'warming', 'not', 'do', 'well', 'Chris', 'tremendous', 'credibility', 'here', 'Especially', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'calling', 'carbon', 'dioxide', 'toxic', 'nobody', 'saying', 'only', 'said', 'carbon', 'dioxide', 'TRAPS', 'HEAT', 'Glass', 'not', 'toxic', 'heat', 'why', 'use', 'glass', 'greenhouses', 'why', 'CO2', 'called', 'greenhouse', 'gas', 'not', 'toxic', 'gas', 'Where', 'did', 'get', 'toxic', 'bit', '5', 'Chris', 'population', 'problem', 'planet', 'politicians', 'have', 'publicly', 'stated', 'population', 'problem', 'just', 'thing', 'government', 'making', 'up', 'control', 'populations', 'ARE', 'too', 'high', 'Even', 'US', 'even', 'been', 'declining', 'been', 'interest', 'mine', ""'ve"", 'researched', 'can', 'argue', 'about', 'justification', 'say', ""n't"", 'population', 'problem', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'learn', 'fight', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'alone', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'take', 'global', 'warming', 'account', 'recognize', 'need', 'stablize', 'populations', 'think', 'government', 'gains', 'money', 'MORE', 'people', 'paying', 'taxes', 'not', 'less', 'therefore', 'financial', 'interest', 'minimize', 'population', 'Think', 'it.I', 'know', 'conspiracies', 'see', 'corruption', 'exposed', 'let', 'not', 'get', 'carried', 'away']",Invisible Empire: A New World Order Defined
