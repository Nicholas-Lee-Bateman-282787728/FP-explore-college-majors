E Jackson,"[3, 7]","Alright, let me explain why I love Son of the Mask: if you watch the movie JUST for the special effects, I think you will find yourself really into it, and your opinions will go up.As for the storyline and character development and all that stuff... well, there's really not a whole lot of it.  In fact, hardly none.  If there's any development going on, it's just BARELY there.  It's the type of comedy that's really far-fetched, but I honestly believe the special effects save the thing.  I've never EVER seen so many ""totally out there"" effects in all my life.  As you can imagine, the pacing is pretty fast too.Most of the focus is on the little baby, who really cracks me up with all the exaggerated special effects they gave him.  The same can be said for the family dog.  It's just like watching a cartoon, only it's NOT a cartoon!The effects are EXTRAORDINARY!  Not to mention NONSTOP.

897437,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00080ZFZW,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[3, 4]","Jamie Kennedy,Brendon Fraser,Tom Green, could you guys stop ruining my dream of being a cartoonist?  I may not had a creative animated thought put in paper for several years (heck, I don't even remember if I drew anything), but I do have prospects of THINKING of being a cartoonist.  Do you guys have to immerse yourself into incomprehensible, out-of-control, and disgusting situations just to prove that dreams can come true?  That sounds depressing, but (and in true critical segue fashion) not as depressing as ""Son of the Mask"" entirely.  This movie is as full-of-life as an ebola virus, and tickles my funny bone as well as the electric chair.Tim Avery (Kennedy) is a eccentric wannabe cartoonist who can't seem to get ahead of himself to support his loving wife, played by Traylor Howard, who wanted a child for this family.  When his dog found the iconic mask on the lake and brought it him, Tim saw the object as junk until he had no choice but to bring it for his job's costume party.  He put on the mask towards the party, and he magically became The Mask.  Just to veer off-subject from the story, I have to say Jamie Kennedy's lousy as The Mask. For some improbable reason, he was less crazy as The Mask than he was as himself; how can you outcrazy the titular character?  And once he got the party started, I had to sit through the most agonizing rendition of Frankie Valli's ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" I've ever seen.  The random zany actions and convenient choreography,that's par for the course, but the song was terribly directed and terribly sung, it was torture to watch and to listen.  Anyway, Tim in Mask form later knocked up his wife, and eventually had a baby named Alvey.  Once his wife left townto solve crimes with an obsessive compulsive detective, Tim was left alone to care for Alvey, knowing soon enough the baby has the Mask mojo.  Oh, boy.A baby crying and Jamie Kennedy trying to be funny, a combo that's utterly the most painful thing I had to experience.  But I was truly suffering once a CGI baby replaced the real baby and decided to his influence on cartoons to make his daddy go insane, and then the dog used the mask on himself to fend off the baby from doing so in elaborate schemes.  With the two CGI models duking each other out, along with a few decent animated shorts in intervals, this sequel could've been better as a cartoon.  Yea, I said the same thing about ""Furry Vengeance"", but that film actually made me laugh a couple of times.  ""Son of the Mask"" isn't funny at all, it's just painful.  The majority of the plot is just the baby and the dog imitating and ripping off much better traps from much better Looney Tunes cartoons.And then there's Loki (Alan Cummings), a villain who's recurring gag is dressing in silly clothing, being an awful CGI creature, and pulling childish pranks on parents (I know he's the God of Mischief, but this is akin to a class clown in elementary school). He has to find the baby who might lead the location of the mask, a mythological tool of his, which he has to give back to his father Odin, played by Bob Hoskins.  I hate this movie to death, but I must say Hoskins looked good as Odin, both in make-up and costume.  But Odin's nice threads isn't enough to deal with Loki, who ended up being just as much of a nuisance as the fake toddler.""Son of the Mask"" follows the dubious tradition of ""Son of King Kong"", ""Son of Godzilla"" and ""Son of Frankenstein"", and this is the worse, and also the most terrifying, Son of them all.  The cartoony antics gave me a headache, the characters are intolerant, and the movie followed an unspoken limitlessness of implausibility that frustrated me; in one specific scene when Loki became mortal for his undoings, the baby then sandwiched him with two large trash bin which, as a mortal, should've turned him into gooey remains from a""Saw""experiment rather than make him comically fall down.  This is the reason I avoid children's movies like this, because at their worse, they really make me explode in anger.

Just keep in mind this is a story of the son and the family dog. It's not focused on the grown-ups. I guess that's why it feels more like a kids movie?The special effects are fantastic. There are a couple of weak special effect moments, but overall they're very impressive and very intertaining. I could have done without the urinating scene and the head-spining-vomiting scene(""The Exorcist""). It just seemed way too over-the-top for my liking. I absolutely cannot understand why they felt this crude humor and frightening visuals would have been funny or appropriate for kids to watch? In fact, those couple of scenes are the only negative things I really have to say about this movie. Of course, this isn't the only kids movie that pushes the bar of good taste. It really seems to be the norm anymore! However, it doesn't make it okay here.There are several, and yet again I have no idea why, curse words in it. Fortunately, for us, we have the SANYO dvd player with the built-in TVGuardian that filters out the cuss words(Wal-Mart is the only place I've seen these dvd players and they're under $50 now, too.). To me, the cuss filter is important these days because there's so many kids movies that are teaching our children to talk like sailors.I gave this movie 5 stars to help offset all the 1 stars that I feel were unfairly given. Sure there's no Jim Carrey and, yes, a few scenes would have been better with him as ""The Mask"" but Jamie Kennedy did okay even though as ""The Mask"" he just really didn't seem to be into it. Maybe that's because he knew this movie was not about the grown-ups? There's some great ""Looney Toons"" type fun in it that easily makes worth watching. Especially if you like wild and crazy entertainment. Just remember, the infant and the dog are the stars of the show. I think you'll really enjoy the movie much more if you keep that in mind.",5,Alot of FUN...fantastic SPECIAL EFFECTS...Looney-Toons,1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,2182,"['SON', 'THE', 'MASK', 'DVD', 'Sure', 'acting', 'weak', 'times', 'not', 'terrible', 'Sure', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'adults', 'kids', 'are', 'gon', 'love', 'sure', 'Mask', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'much', 'human', 'mask', 'dog', 'Mask', 'star', 'really', 'show', 'Just', 'keep', 'mind', 'story', 'son', 'family', 'dog', 'not', 'focused', 'grown-ups', 'guess', 'why', 'more', 'kids', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'fantastic', 'are', 'couple', 'weak', 'special', 'effect', 'moments', 'overall', ""'re"", 'very', 'impressive', 'very', 'intertaining', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'urinating', 'scene', 'head-spining-vomiting', 'scene', 'Exorcist', 'just', 'seemed', 'way', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'liking', 'absolutely', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'felt', 'crude', 'humor', 'frightening', 'visuals', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'appropriate', 'kids', 'watch', 'fact', 'couple', 'scenes', 'are', 'only', 'negative', 'things', 'really', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'course', ""n't"", 'only', 'kids', 'movie', 'bar', 'good', 'taste', 'really', 'be', 'norm', 'anymore', 'However', ""n't"", 'make', 'are', 'several', 'yet', 'again', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'curse', 'words', 'Fortunately', 'have', 'SANYO', 'dvd', 'player', 'built-in', 'TVGuardian', 'out', 'cuss', 'words', 'Wal-Mart', 'only', 'place', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dvd', 'players', ""'re"", '50', 'now', 'too.', 'cuss', 'filter', 'important', 'days', 'so', 'many', 'kids', 'movies', 'are', 'teaching', 'children', 'talk', 'sailors.I', 'gave', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'help', 'offset', '1', 'stars', 'feel', 'were', 'unfairly', 'given', 'Sure', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'yes', 'few', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Mask', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'did', 'okay', 'even', 'Mask', 'just', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'Maybe', 'knew', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'grown-ups', 'great', 'Looney', 'Toons', 'type', 'fun', 'easily', 'worth', 'watching', 'Especially', 'like', 'wild', 'crazy', 'entertainment', 'Just', 'remember', 'infant', 'dog', 'are', 'stars', 'show', 'think', ""'ll"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'keep', 'mind']",N/A

Let's take a film that was wildly successful and make a sequel out of it!""Perfect! We'll get B-grade actors who have half the charisma and want only 10% of Carrey's original salary. We'll save millions and rake in a massive profit, never mind the fact nobody wants to see a second rate sequel with none of the original actors that made it popular in the first place! We as executives still honestly believe a movie was popular based on the name and story, not the actors who made it so in the first place!""""Brilliant! Let's put a massive budget and get the cheapest actors we can find!""And really, that's what Son of the Mask can be described as. Just a simple B-grade movie that attempts to suck the life out of its original classic.Nevertheless, if the movie didn't contain the words the mask, or anything to do with the mask, it would be a nice kid's movie. For all its massive flaws and horrible acting, this really will appeal to kids because it surly did to mine. It's a good natured flick that really wants to scream out ""like me!"" but only those 8 and younger will truly enjoy it.Jamie Kennedy is clearly is trying to make the material work, playing the desperate dad but the script is so poor, the only thing that spews out that is worthwhile was my drink after seeing this. The character of Loki also deserves a mention, as he was the most enjoyable character and really one of the only reasons for older adults to see this film. It's too bad the character is wasted on this film; I would have really liked to have seen the character take on the true mask. Instead, we are reduced to fart jokes and toilet humor near the end.But it's a family friendly film, no naughty words, no nudity. And, hey, when you're at a kid's movie, you can't always expect Oscar winning performances. I was laughing my head off at some scenes, including one where the dog draws up a booby-trap plan to get back at the baby, and instead ends up getting caught in the trap itself. Instantly reminded me of Wild E. Coyote, getting his ACME trap to get the Roadrunner, and instead gets caught in it himself. That's the beauty of cartoons, you really don't have to think much, you don't have to ponder, just watch!While I know that this movie will never get a good rating, it doesn't deserve the '1' that everyone is giving it.

Well let me tell you that if you pretend that there was never a first Mask movie this one would be ok. Sadly, There has been a first movie made and the first one kiss this ones butt. The story starts off with a tour of a museum where we see a dark character in the back of the group. The tour guide starts talking about The Mask and how the god behind creating LOKI was a terrible god who was banished. The dark figure unmasks himself and it is LOKI. Becoming angry at what he has heard he show his power and takes the mask. Unfortunately this is not the original. After that, we are shown that Jamie kennedy does not seem to want to have a baby but his wife does. His dog Otis find the mask floating in a river and he bring it home. Jamies wife pleads with him to have a baby and nothing in the world would please her more. We see that Jamie plays a character with a lot of skill in drawing but has not gotten anywhere and settles for working as a mascot. While going to a Halloween party Jamie put the mask on and WOW's the crowd. Even a high time executive. In the excitment Jamie rushes back home and sleeps with his wife with the mask on. Creating The Son Of The Mask. Loki is still trying to find the Mask and is informed by his father that a baby has been created from the mask and if he finds the baby he will find the mask. When the son is actually born we see how Jamie is actually taking to fatherhood and it's not going well. If this wasn't enough Jamies wife has to leave for a week. Making the mistake of putting the Son in front of the television to watch cartoons the baby gets all these ideas to drive Jamie insane and getting him sent to a insane assylum. Jamies dog who is jealous of the baby put the Mask on and devises ideas and puts them into action on how to get rid of the baby. Creating a funny and slap stick comedy between the baby and dog. Untimately, The story-line if you do not get it is Loki looking for the Mask. Jamie creates a baby from putting the Mask on and now the baby has the mask power. Jamie trying to coupe with becoming a father. Otis the dog trying to get rid of the baby. I will leave the ending to your imagination or you can go see the movie. I feel as though this movie was OK.

I thought the Scooby Doo films had some pretty bad CGI characters but Son of the Mask takes the cake by far. The only CGI character they got away with was masked Ottis, the family dog. And that's fine. I can accept an animated green faced dog running around causing mischief and trying to blow things up in a very cartoonish manner. This worked because CGI anthropomorphism is just easier to accept and it didn't try to switch from normal Ottis to crazy masked Ottis in one or two shots. When Ottis was masked, he remained masked for a while, so really there was no comparison between the real dog and the animated dog. But with the baby, this was a totally different story because the baby didn't need the wear the mask, it was in his genes, so when he did something crazy and cartoony it went from a real shot of the baby to an instant CGI baby and this just looked horrible. The CGI baby looked like a deformed version of the real baby and when they tried to blend the real shots with the animated shots it just ended up looking really stupid and pathetic.Aside from that, the movie had some overall embarassingly stupid characters that were very badly acted and had a drunken out of control car wreck of a storyline, all about 7 or 8 years too late.

I really enjoyed the scenes with the baby.  My favorite scene doesn't involve too many special effects... it is the scene in which the baby crawls into Jamie's arms.  The music is very pretty... a beautiful rendition, in fact, of ""Somewhere over the rainbow"" sung by the Hawaiian singer IZ, I believe.As a parent, I would suggest that if you are at all considering letting your kids watch this be sure to watch it yourself first.  That way, you can decide if it is too violent or scary.

At a HALLOWEEN party, Tim puts the mask on, and becomes just as zany as Stanley had. After the party, he goes home and makes sweet love to his wife with the mask on.

897460,A2DWWZ6QIWBJ8D,B00080ZFZW,"Thomas ""moviedudereviews""","[3, 4]","Since a number of reviewers trashed this movie with good reason, I will first point out the two thing that were actually good about Son of the Mask. One is Alan Cumming's performance as Loki. Alan did the best he could to work with a bad script. Sadly, not even his talented acting could save this film. The second good thing about Son of the Mask is that if you are the parent of a 13 year old or younger, your kid(s) may actually enjoy this film. Now for the much anticipated critism... Son of the Mask is actually one movie in which I have to agree with the critics on terms of being inferior to it's predecessor. The talented performance that Jim Carrey brought into the original Mask is sorely missed as Jamie Kennedy tries too hard in this sequel to come off as being humorous. At least Alan Cumming as Loki brought some dynamics to his character. As for the rest of the humor, it is much too over-the-top. If you are 13 and under, this may not bother you so much. As for me, I am a man who enjoys good comedy but the comedy in Son of the Mask doesn't even rank up to the dumb & dumber prequel. I give this dvd a second star for the good selection of bonus features. Chances are though, if you don't like this movie then you probably won't care to view the features. Oh well, at least the dvd has good picture and sound quality.

897461,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00080ZFZW,Tsuyoshi,"[9, 13]","Now I'm writing from Japan, where this film is now being shown as 'Mask 2.'  Probably in America, this misleading title would make disappointed and angry audiences to sue some people, those who are responsible for deceding on making the in-name-only suquel to Jim Carrey comedy sans Jim and Cameron.  At least, 'The Son of the Mask' is honest about its contents -- it's about the cartoon-writer who happens to be wearing the mask when he was in bed with his wife who suddenly becomes mother to a super-power baby.  Got it?Jamie Kennedy (so good in 'Scream' and its sequel) plays Tim Avery, an aspiring cartoon creator.  Though he is living with a beautiful wife Tanya (Traylor Howard, who happened to be in 'Me, Myself & Irene' as Jim Carrey's wife!), he is far from being a successful artist.  But one day, he gets a chance for promotion thanks to the mysterious mask that changes this painfully timid guy into the man with a green face.But as the film shows in the opening, someone else wants the magical mask (who doesn't?).  That's Loki (Alan Cumming), son of the Norse God Odin (Bob Hoskins), who orders Loki to retrieve the mask.  All right, so, this is about Tim and Loki.Wrong.  Actually, there's more to come.  Tim has got an ultra-power baby and a dog called Otis, who got somehow (don't ask how) super-power to play a trick or two (thanks to the mask ... again).  The middle section of the film is about the battle between the baby and the dog in the CGI-enhanced cartoonish fashion.  No wonder the director is Lawrence Guterman, 'Cats and Dogs.'[YOU MEAN TEX AVERY?] The job of Jamie Kennedy's character and his surname Avery are clearly reference to the legendary genius Tex Avery.  And some part of the film is shot in the way that somehow reminds us of Avery's lightening-speed storytelling style -- see the poor dog dragged by the rope attached to his tail all, yes, ALL around the house.I admit the sight gags themselves are not as bad as some previous reviews suggest.  The point is, however, how to present them.  You just cannot extend the ten minute cartoon beyond its limit.  You just cannot let someone else imitate the Jim Carrey's rubber face gags when no one else can do that.  Most importantly, you never throw these gross, tired, cliched toilet gags into the story even though you know and we know that you have nothing to do except to extend the running time.The CGIs are from ILM and Tippet Studio, which means the top brand of the industry.  And the film's CGIs would have been great in some other films.  But not here, they are wasted.  Alan Cumming in 'cute-little-girl' costume is wasted.  And my time is wasted.

So far The Life(Daryl Hannah) was the worst. I rented this movie deliberately to see a silly kids movie just for fun, and that's what I got from this film. It's story is absolutely silly and cheessy, but it's a non-stop special effects packed to ensure a cartoonish viewing experience. No doubt, this film should not be compared the Jim Carrey's Mask, because the story is not for adults. It actually has more special effects, and it was making me dizzy sometimes. They did so many parodies of other movie characters and celebtries throughout this film. Some of them were too silly. For instance, the baby Alvey's peeing a fountain of urine at Jamie Kennedy was too much. The action scenes were a bit violent for a kids movie. Alan Cumming was a comic force, and he did his best with the multiple character transformations.The baby had fun pulling his pranks on his daddy, and the computer assisted dance number was one of the cuter moments.
