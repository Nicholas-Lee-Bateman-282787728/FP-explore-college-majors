847209,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B0002VGRF4,Carl Manes,"[4, 4]","DEATH GAME is a forgotten gem that plays out like a reversal on LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. George gets more than he bargained for when he allows two young girls in to use his phone. Things get hot and heavy quickly when the girls decide to seduce the married man, but he soon finds himself at their mercy after they take him captive and force him to play their sick games! The two leading ladies are sufficiently twisted, providing enough menace to the roles as they manipulate and torture their victim. They then draw fiendish faces on themselves with George's wife's make-up as they play dress-up and destroy the house while George watches on in horror. DEATH GAME possesses all of the ingredients for a successful Exploitation feature, complete with gritty filming, a sick plot, and plenty of gratuitous nudity. Director Peter Traynor never attempts a completely serious tone, however there are many moments that achieve a surreal, nightmarish mood thanks to key lighting borrowed from Mario Bava and strong performances indebted to his kooky actresses. 70s sleaze aficionados should be sure to seek out this little known title!-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",3,Death Game,1271980800,"04 23, 2010",2010,1159,"['DEATH', 'GAME', 'forgotten', 'gem', 'out', 'reversal', 'LAST', 'HOUSE', 'ON', 'LEFT', 'George', 'more', 'bargained', 'when', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'use', 'phone', 'Things', 'get', 'hot', 'heavy', 'quickly', 'when', 'girls', 'decide', 'seduce', 'married', 'man', 'soon', 'mercy', 'take', 'captive', 'force', 'play', 'sick', 'games', 'two', 'leading', 'ladies', 'are', 'sufficiently', 'twisted', 'providing', 'enough', 'menace', 'roles', 'manipulate', 'torture', 'victim', 'then', 'draw', 'fiendish', 'George', 'wife', 'make-up', 'play', 'dress-up', 'destroy', 'house', 'George', 'watches', 'horror', 'DEATH', 'GAME', 'ingredients', 'successful', 'Exploitation', 'feature', 'complete', 'gritty', 'filming', 'sick', 'plot', 'plenty', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'Director', 'Peter', 'Traynor', 'never', 'completely', 'serious', 'tone', 'however', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'achieve', 'surreal', 'nightmarish', 'mood', 'thanks', 'key', 'lighting', 'borrowed', 'Mario', 'Bava', 'strong', 'performances', 'indebted', 'kooky', 'actresses', '70s', 'sleaze', 'aficionados', 'should', 'be', 'sure', 'seek', 'out', 'little', 'known', 'title', '-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

The plot was interesting & the dialogue wasn't overdone.  If you enjoy offbeat B cult suspensers, this is one of the finest I've seen.  The film conveys a message to the viewer on a psychological level.  Don't be hasty by passing up a chance to see this film.  I've had the VHS print for years, & now that it's finally available on DVD, I'll be ordering a copy in that format as well.  I'll agree with what it says on the DVD cover... Death Game is unnerving... Unnerving & riveting.  It'll keep you glued from beginning to end.

847212,A3V5YEY65T37UL,B0002VGRF4,David Butler,"[15, 15]","There are no doubt dozens of untapped cinematic gold mines out there just waiting to be discovered and this is one of the best. Check out the premise: one rainy night a family man is alone in his home when two beautiful teenage girls appear at his door, apparently lost. They ask to come in to use the phone and he lets them in. Little does he know what awaits. For the next forty-eight hours, the girls have the time of their lives torturing him with sexuality and violence. They tie him up, beat him up, humiliate him and trash his house.Sondra Locke, perhaps best known for her Clint Eastwood movies, is phenomenal as the brilliantly disturbed lead, Jackson. She is rageful and calculating and in complete control. Little touches like the ringmaster outfit she dons and the ""horns"" she draws on her forehead with lipstick make her character the epitome of sexy as well as undeniably frightening. (I hope to find someone like her someday-minus the psychotic tendencies, that is.)Well known vixen Colleen Camp plays Donna, Jackson's lover and cohort. Obviously the female in the relationship, Donna has a more playful, little girl appeal about her.Although this movie was not improved for DVD, has horrific sound quality(Seymour Cassel's voice was dubbed with someone else's), and is too dated with it's disco montage, it is quite a little treasure. I rented it a couple years ago and fell in love immediately, particularly with the Jackson character. With all the stupid remakes of today(like Psycho!), it's a pity something like this slips through the cracks. Death Game (a.k.a. The Seducers, a.k.a. Mr. Manning's Weekend) is good and deserves higher recognition.By the way, this flick is based on a true story.

847214,A1VF1FY3QIUEQT,B0002VGRF4,Joseph,"[7, 7]","Locke and Camp are awesome in this movie.  Too bad the movie let them down.  The DVD is terrible.  Poor quality that I think can be blamed mostly on the print and original filmmakers and some on the manufacturer.  The movie itself, Cassel's voice is dubbed over by somebody else, editing needs to be redone, sound needs to be redone, and I don't know if it was wear, filmstock, or not using a real cinematographer, but I'd like to see them go back in time and re-shoot the whole thing with quality work.  The great work and beautiful bodies of Locke and Camp deserve it.  They both pull off some really crazy, sexy, and chilling moments in what overall could have been a great tale of a married man's fantasy night becoming a nightmare.  I could say there needs to be an updated remake, but they wouldn't get it right.The DVD, needs to be redone.  I don't think they were working with much of a source, but they caused some of the problems I saw, I.E. pauses at the chapter breaks.  Plus, I think there is something on the screen, once you get into the movie, that may have been on the source but looks like something that possibly scanned in with their equipment.  It is as if there is a screen between the movie and your TV screen and it has a glare on it.ANYWAY, at least it is a cheap DVD.  If you think this will be the only release of this film on DVD buy it cheap now.  At least you get to see it and hey, the cover is kinda cool looking.

847216,A2OP21WUY8L3WL,B0002VGRF4,Robert Meeks,"[3, 6]","In 'Death Game' Locke and Camp play a pair of women who essentially seek thrills without concern for others. As a matter of fact the more they can torture someone the more enjoyment they get from it. With a premise like this you would certainly hope they would get more mileage from it, but alas, the biggest threat they pose to their married man they have imprisoned in his own home is talking him to death. Locke and Camp are effective in their roles and can certainly turn on the sex appeal while being so menacing that you would not want to get near them. They have plenty of dialogue (too much) and a director who likes to linger on scenes too long. This comes off rather like a stage play on film. There is of course the payoff scene of Locke and Camp in a bath together which should wake you up at that point. I will not give it away, but the final scene involving the van is well shot. I watched this scene several times in slow motion and it was still effective. Overall 'Death Game' is a film with a lot of talk and a lot of tease with very little payoff considering the potential they had with the subject matter.-Bob",2,Every man's fantasy: to be talked to death?,1102032000,"12 3, 2004",2004,1128,"[""'Death"", 'Game', 'Locke', 'Camp', 'play', 'pair', 'women', 'who', 'essentially', 'seek', 'thrills', 'concern', 'others', 'matter', 'fact', 'more', 'can', 'torture', 'someone', 'more', 'enjoyment', 'get', 'premise', 'would', 'certainly', 'hope', 'would', 'get', 'more', 'mileage', 'alas', 'biggest', 'threat', 'pose', 'married', 'man', 'have', 'imprisoned', 'own', 'home', 'talking', 'death', 'Locke', 'Camp', 'are', 'effective', 'roles', 'can', 'certainly', 'turn', 'sex', 'appeal', 'being', 'so', 'menacing', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'get', 'have', 'plenty', 'dialogue', 'too', 'much', 'director', 'who', 'linger', 'scenes', 'too', 'long', 'off', 'rather', 'stage', 'play', 'film', 'course', 'payoff', 'scene', 'Locke', 'Camp', 'bath', 'together', 'should', 'wake', 'up', 'point', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'final', 'scene', 'involving', 'van', 'well', 'shot', 'watched', 'scene', 'several', 'times', 'slow', 'motion', 'was', 'still', 'effective', 'Overall', ""'Death"", 'Game', 'film', 'lot', 'talk', 'lot', 'tease', 'very', 'little', 'payoff', 'considering', 'potential', 'had', 'subject', 'matter.-Bob']",N/A
