276457,A1P27BGF8NAI29,6301965957,Alice in Wonderland,"[1, 1]","This 1937 movie is a retelling of Rudyard Kipling's 1897 novel of the same name. In this movie, Harvey Cheyne, the spoiled son of a wealthy but distant father, falls overboard off a Europe-bound ship, and is rescued by a down-to-earth Portuguese fisherman, Manuel Fidello. Unimpressed with the young castaway's unlikely claims of wealth, the captain of the fishing boat offers Harvey a low paying job, in exchange for which Harvey will be fed and taken care of. During the course of the long voyage, Harvey learns a great lesson in humility and caring for others.This is an excellent movie, one that is still wonderful to watch all these years later. Spencer Tracy (playing Manuel) and Freddie Bartholomew (playing Harvey) both bring a real potency to their roles, giving the movie a startling realism. If you want a nice family-friendly movie, one that with an enthralling storyline and a good lesson, then checkout this classic!(Review of Captains Courageous starring Spencer Tracy and Freddie Bartholomew)",5,An excellent movie,1279843200,"07 23, 2010",2010,1008,"['1937', 'movie', 'retelling', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', '1897', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'movie', 'Harvey', 'Cheyne', 'spoiled', 'son', 'wealthy', 'distant', 'father', 'overboard', 'off', 'Europe-bound', 'ship', 'rescued', 'down-to-earth', 'Portuguese', 'fisherman', 'Manuel', 'Fidello', 'Unimpressed', 'young', 'castaway', 'unlikely', 'claims', 'wealth', 'captain', 'fishing', 'boat', 'Harvey', 'low', 'paying', 'job', 'exchange', 'Harvey', 'will', 'be', 'fed', 'taken', 'care', 'course', 'long', 'voyage', 'Harvey', 'great', 'lesson', 'humility', 'caring', 'others.This', 'excellent', 'movie', 'one', 'still', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'years', 'later', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'playing', 'Manuel', 'Freddie', 'Bartholomew', 'playing', 'Harvey', 'bring', 'real', 'potency', 'roles', 'giving', 'movie', 'startling', 'realism', 'want', 'nice', 'family-friendly', 'movie', 'one', 'enthralling', 'storyline', 'good', 'lesson', 'then', 'checkout', 'classic', 'Review', 'Captains', 'Courageous', 'starring', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Freddie', 'Bartholomew']",N/A

276459,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301965957,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I just want to say that I absolutely LOVE Spencer Tracy.  The man was one of the finest actors of all time, and when you consider that my modern-day actorly crush falls on (and all over) Russell Crowe, who is like the modern-day equivalent to Spencer Tracy, it all makes sense.  The man was a genius; so comforting and honest in his acting and a complete force to be reckoned with.  The man disappeared in every role, while never losing that little piece of himself that made his performances so endearing.`Captains Courageous' marks the first of Tracy's two back-to-back Oscar wins.  His second came for `Boy's Town'.  I find it kind of telling that both of his wins, while early in his career, underscored his knack for playing fatherly figures that exuded warmth and an earnestness that would prove a signature method for Tracy.The film tells the story of a spoiled brat named Henry who suffers from the loss of a mother and a workaholic father.  With no determinable guidance, Henry is a nuisance to all he comes in contact with, so much so that he is forced out of school and in the care of his father for a few months.  While on a cruise, Henry makes a foolish decision in order to gloat and winds up overboard.  He is then rescued by a Portuguese fisherman named Manuel and recruited aboard a fishing-boat with no hope of seeing dry land or his father for three months.  Initially, Henry is his old self; rude, demeaning and unworkable, but he is soon softened by the kind heart of Manuel and once he comes under his wing, he begins to grow as a person.There are many films that work a similar theme, showing how the guiding hand of a wiser man can mold the hearts of the young and immature, but very few can match the strength of `Captains Courageous', a beautifully balanced film that melds genres so effortlessly.  It is a dramatic familial piece, a witty character study and an exciting seafaring adventure all in one, and it never feels uneven or unfocused.The entire cast is splendid.  In fact, this is one of my favorite ensemble pieces.  Everyone involved fleshes out their characters brilliantly; adding layer upon layer to the proceedings.  Spencer Tracy earned that Oscar despite the accent work (which was spotty in parts) because he breathed so much life and honesty into his character.  Freddie Bartholomew delivers one of my favorite child performances of all time here, understanding fully his characters lack of charm and chipping away at that rough exterior with sublime realism.  You believe every character arc he undergoes.  Lionel Barrymore is outstanding as the fishing-boat's captain, lacing his stern deliveries with a cheeriness of heart; letting us know that above all else, this man is a father.  Melvyn Douglas has just a few scenes, but he uses them admirably; giving us a look at a man misguided by his own ambitions.  Even Mickey Rooney, who shot to major success the following year in that `other' Spencer Tracy Oscar winner, is wonderfully restrained here (something he didn't do a whole lot of during his career).Like I said, everyone is just great here.So, if you want a heart-swelling dramatic adventure film, this is the one you should reach for without hesitation!",5,Courage in an unlikely place...,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,3210,"['just', 'want', 'say', 'absolutely', 'LOVE', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'man', 'was', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'time', 'when', 'consider', 'modern-day', 'actorly', 'crush', 'over', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'who', 'modern-day', 'equivalent', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'sense', 'man', 'was', 'genius', 'comforting', 'honest', 'acting', 'complete', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'man', 'disappeared', 'role', 'never', 'losing', 'little', 'piece', 'made', 'performances', 'so', 'endearing.', 'Captains', 'Courageous', 'marks', 'first', 'Tracy', 'two', 'back-to-back', 'Oscar', 'wins', 'second', 'came', 'Boy', 'Town', 'find', 'kind', 'telling', 'wins', 'early', 'career', 'underscored', 'knack', 'playing', 'fatherly', 'figures', 'exuded', 'warmth', 'earnestness', 'would', 'prove', 'signature', 'method', 'Tracy.The', 'film', 'story', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'named', 'Henry', 'who', 'loss', 'mother', 'workaholic', 'father', 'determinable', 'guidance', 'Henry', 'nuisance', 'contact', 'so', 'much', 'forced', 'school', 'care', 'father', 'few', 'months', 'cruise', 'Henry', 'foolish', 'decision', 'order', 'gloat', 'up', 'overboard', 'then', 'rescued', 'Portuguese', 'fisherman', 'named', 'Manuel', 'recruited', 'fishing-boat', 'hope', 'seeing', 'dry', 'land', 'father', 'three', 'months', 'Initially', 'Henry', 'old', 'self', 'rude', 'demeaning', 'unworkable', 'soon', 'softened', 'kind', 'heart', 'Manuel', 'once', 'wing', 'grow', 'are', 'many', 'films', 'work', 'similar', 'theme', 'showing', 'how', 'guiding', 'hand', 'wiser', 'man', 'can', 'mold', 'hearts', 'young', 'immature', 'very', 'few', 'can', 'match', 'strength', 'Captains', 'Courageous', 'beautifully', 'balanced', 'film', 'genres', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'dramatic', 'familial', 'piece', 'witty', 'character', 'study', 'exciting', 'seafaring', 'adventure', 'one', 'never', 'uneven', 'unfocused.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'splendid', 'fact', 'one', 'favorite', 'ensemble', 'pieces', 'Everyone', 'involved', 'fleshes', 'out', 'characters', 'brilliantly', 'adding', 'layer', 'layer', 'proceedings', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'accent', 'work', 'was', 'spotty', 'parts', 'breathed', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'honesty', 'character', 'Freddie', 'Bartholomew', 'one', 'favorite', 'child', 'performances', 'time', 'here', 'understanding', 'fully', 'characters', 'lack', 'charm', 'chipping', 'away', 'rough', 'exterior', 'sublime', 'realism', 'believe', 'character', 'arc', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'outstanding', 'fishing-boat', 'captain', 'lacing', 'stern', 'deliveries', 'cheeriness', 'heart', 'letting', 'know', 'else', 'man', 'father', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'just', 'few', 'scenes', 'admirably', 'giving', 'look', 'man', 'misguided', 'own', 'ambitions', 'Even', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'who', 'shot', 'major', 'success', 'following', 'year', 'other', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'wonderfully', 'restrained', 'here', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'career', '.Like', 'said', 'everyone', 'just', 'great', 'here.So', 'want', 'heart-swelling', 'dramatic', 'adventure', 'film', 'one', 'should', 'reach', 'hesitation']",N/A

Manuel, the fisherman who pulled him out of the water when he went overboard from the high-class liner on which he and his father were going to Europe is played by Spencer Tracy. Disko, the good-natured captain of the fishing boat, is played by Lionel Barrymore. Mr. Cheyne, who I think is Harvey's father, is played by Melvin Douglas. (These people are all so young compared to what I'm used to that I'm not sure, but pretty sure.) Dan, Captain Disko's son, is played by Mickey Rooney. Long Jack, the fisherman who warns the others that the boy is a Jonas, and bad luck, because he is a passenger (and thereby forces the captain to put him on the payroll at $3 a month and put him to work), is played by John Carradine.Well, I guess I've told you a good bit of the story already. As the movie opens, Harvey has invited a few of his classmates from his boarding school to spend Easter vacation with him on his father's huge estate. He insists they must have breakfast in bed, because he wants to show off. Then he reveals that he wants their help in being admitted to the Buffaloes, a club they belong to and he does not. He threatens one of the boys with the ruin of his father's business if he does not cooperate.Back at school, he is soon exposed as the spoiled bully he is, and put in ""coventry."" No one is to speak to him or allow him to speak to them. If he tries, he is to be reported. But of course, rules don't apply to this brat, and so he breaks coventry. Eventually, he is thrown out of school, as much for lying about anything he wants to as for any other reason.Naturally, as fathers will, his father blames himself, and decides he'll take Harvey with him on a business trip to Europe. So that's why he was on that liner from which he fell into the ocean and was fished out by Manuel. See above.It's a good story, and if you know enough about fishing and sailing not to get lost in the details, probably a great movie.

As the son of a millionaire industrialist (Melvyn Douglas), Harvey can do whatever he pleases and not be bothered by consequences.  At his exclusive school, Harvey buys friendships, attempts to bribe his way into high grades, and blackmails when he doesn't get his own way.  When Harvey is finally caught out by his father, he's packed off on a ship, where Harvey, still not having learned his lesson, drinks one too many icecream sodas, and, ill and confusedly wandering the fog-shrouded decks, tumbles off the ship and into the ocean below.Rescued by passing fisherman Manuel Fidello (Spencer Tracy) and the crew of the fishing schooner 'We're Here!', operated by Captain Disko Troop (Lionel Barrymore), indignant Harvey wants to be taken back ashore.  Sure thing...in three months.  Captain Disko's in the middle of a bumper haul and nothing's going to stop him...not even a millionaire's lost son!  Pretty soon, Harvey realises that his regular ""whiny brat"" act won't cut it for this crowd.  Finally forced to pull up his socks and act like a man, Harvey thrives under the close influence of Manuel.CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS should be mandatory viewing for family audiences, not just fathers and sons, although, at the end of the day, it's the story of a fractured father/son relationship and the incredibly hard work that's required in order to repair it.Spencer Tracy initially didn't want to take the role of Manuel, fearing he'd be overshadowed and upstaged by co-star Freddie Bartholomew.  Admittedly, child stars can do that for their adult castmates, but to say that against Bartholomew is a definite insult, as Bartholomew was a very instinctual, sensitive child actor and had successfully held his own with the likes of Greta Garbo (""Anna Karenina"") and W.C. Fields (""David Copperfield"") without throwing off the spotlight.  Tracy also didn't appreciate having to have his hair curled and dyed to play the Portugese Manuel (Joan Crawford remarked he looked like Harpo Marx), though, if I may say so, the curls become him!  CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS also features a roster of some of MGM's strongest male performers (Charley Grapewin, John Carradine and Leo G.

(Who would've thought the macho Victor Fleming would direct a story with such sensitivity and warmth amidst not only the leads but supporting castmembers Melvyn Douglas, Lionel Barrymore, and the up-and-coming Mickey Rooney?) Even though Tracy capped (and deserved) the Oscar, 12-year-old Bartholomew is a revelation as he learns about humility, honor, friendship, and growing up throughout the entire film. (A bewitching sequence shows Bartholomew play a prank which backfires on him and nearly costs him his friendship with Tracy.) The film could be accused of datedness, but it is a testimony to the basic Kipling story that it has been filmed three times, twice for television. (Can a Broadway musical be far off?) Full of wonderful black-and-white cinematography and ocean-fog special effects, it needs to come to DVD immediately.

Luckily, he is pulled out of the drink by a humble Portuguese fisherman, a sailor on a fishing boat that boasts Lionel Barrymore, John Carradine, Mickey Rooney and Spencer Tracy as its crew (along with several other fine character actors.) Spencer Tracy apparently won an Oscar for his role, though I find it a weak spot in an otherwise wonderful film: he's hammy (it's Tracy, after all) an his ""Portuguese"" accent is silly... But, he's Tracy and he muscles his way through to an emotionally moving performance, greatly aided by the expressive child actor Freddie Bartholomew and the many talented supporting players. Carradine is perhaps the most convincing of all: he really seems like a roughneck sailor, menacing and earthy when provoked. The script is true to Kipling's vision and all in all, this is fine, old-school Hollywood storytelling. Highly recommended.

276472,A2Z2XG95QFIYCR,6301965957,"djonn ""djonn""","[58, 60]","This is a marvelous movie about a spoiled, insecure child who brags, manipulates, and uses his wealth & positon to feel strong & good about himself (sound like anyone you know?).  After being suspended from school for his antics he is dragged to Europe to accompany his father on a business trip.  En route, he accidentenly falls overboard from the oceanliner (that's how they travelled in those days - - airplane travel was new, rare and horribly expensive) and is rescued by a fisherman.  He learns his lesson, matures and acquires integrity through his association with the crew of fisherman & in particular Spencer Tracy's character.This fine cast consists of legends who give wonderful performances:  John Carradine, Lionel Barrymore, Mickey Rooney, Melvyn Douglas and of course, Spencer Tracy.The film also gives you a rare glimpse into a way of life past.  Today we have huge fishing ships that net miles of fish and have the canneneries right on board.  Without it being intentional, the movie shows one what life was like when people still cared about the work they did and had pride in the honest work they had accomplished. And how many of us still entertain ourselves and family by singing together and/or playing a musical instrument rather than turning to solitary pursuits with electronic machinery?  I am not waxing nostalgic for the days before the advent of universal elecricity!  However, the movie is a snapshot in time of a not so distant past that inspires much food for thought.You may show this movie to your children without fear;not only is there nothing unseemly in it, it has a valuable lesson to teach us all.  And it is of much better quality than any of the so-called ""family films"" that have been produced in the last two decades.  Moreover, it opens up many interesting topics for discussion.HOLLYWOOD TAKE NOTE: you don't need punchy soundtracks, death defying stunts and high tech wizardry to make a good movie - - just an honest story, a good script and a fine cast.  This movie proves that.  It was made 70 yrs ago and we're still buying it.My only complaint with this film is that it's not available on DVD.MARCH 2006:  Thank goodness, this wonderful film has been released on DVD.

276474,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6301965957,Dr. James Gardner,"[2, 2]","""Captains Courageous"" is a 1937 film with Freddie Bartholomew, Melvin Douglas, Spencer Tracy, Lionel Barrymore and Mickey Rooney, directed by the great Victor Fleming from a Rudyard Kipling novel. The film is everything you'd expect with such a pedigree.Freddie Bartholomew (1924-92) was one of the most famous child actors of the 1930s, appearing in ""David Copperfield"" (1935), ""Anna Karenina"" (1935), ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" (1936), and ""Lloyds of London (1936) prior to this film, and ""Kidnapped"" (1938) after. Freddie gives his usual endearing performance as the spoiled rich kid.Melvyn Douglas (1901-81) plays his rich father. Douglas was a great actor, nominated 3 times for an Oscar with 2 wins (""Being There"" in 1979 and ""Hud"" in 1963). He won an Emmy for a 1967 episode of CBS Playhouse and was nominated for a 1965 performance of ""Inherit the Wind"". I remember him best in ""I Never Sang for My Father"" (1970).Spencer Tracy (1900-67) was another giant of the film world. He received 9 Oscar nominations and won twice, his first for this film and followed closely by ""Boy's Town"" (1938), although personally I think ""Inherit the Wind"" (1960) and ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" (1961) were his best performances. Tracy plays a Portuguese fisherman who rescues Freddie from the sea.FWIW - Tracy didn't want to be in the same film with Bartholomew because he was afraid the kid would steal the film, as he did in almost all his films. He also was reluctant to sing (he thought he was tone deaf) and didn't have confidence in his ability to do a Portuguese accent. But he liked and admired director Victor Fleming who was a close friend of Irving Thalberg, so he agreed.The great Lionel Barrymore (1878-1954) plays the ship's captain. He appeared in more than 200 films between 1908 and 1956, and was twice nominated for an Oscar, winning once (""A Free Soul"" ) in 1931 Though he's probably best known as the evil banker in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946) and from his recurring roles in the Dr. Kildare and the Dr. Gillespie films, he gave us many memorable performances -  as the innkeeper in ""Key Largo"" (1948), Thaddeus Stevens in ""Tennessee Johnson"" (1942), Grandpa in ""You Can't Take it With You"" (1938), and Billy Bones in ""Treasure Island"" (1934). This is Barrymore's final film before arthritis made him use crutches and finally put him in a wheelchair.Unlike Freddie Bartholomew, Mickey Rooney's (1920) career lasted, and he made nearly 300 films from 1926 to 2010. He was a major star of the silent era with his ""Mickey's"" shorts and then went on to save MGM with his ""Andy Hardy"" series and his films with Judy Garland. He won a Juvenile Oscar in 1939 and went on to garner 4 nominations. He was nominated 3 times for an Emmy and won once (""Bill"" in 1981).BTW - notice how Mickey allows Freddie to be the star. Mickey was generally low key whenever he played next to Freddie. We see this same relationship in ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" the previous year. This was their third film together.FWIW - Tracy was so impressed with Rooney that when he was offered the role of the priest in ""Boy's Town"" (1938), Tracy was fearful that Rooney would steal the film, just as he was worried about Bartholomew in this film.John Carradine (1906-88) plays a sailor who takes a dislike to Freddie. Carradine was a terrific character actor. He was a part of John Ford's Stock Company and gave memorable performances in ""Prisoner of Shark Island"" (1936), ""Stagecoach"" (1939) and ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (1940). He's best known to us today for his continuing role as Serenity Johnson in son David's TV series ""Kung Fu"" (1972-1975).The film was directed by Victor Fleming (1889-1949). Fleming is best known for ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939) and ""GWTW"" (1939) for which he won an Oscar. He made 49 films including ""Treasure Island"" (1934) and ""Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (1941). He worked often with Spencer Tracy after this film.Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936) wrote Captains Courageous in 1896. Many of Kipling's books were turned into films, the most notable of which are ""Gunga Din"" (1939), ""The Jungle Book"" (1942), and ""The Man Who Would Be King"" (1992).This film won an Oscar for Tracy and 3 more nominations, including Best Picture (won by ""Life of Emile Zola""), Best Editing, and Best Writing. Tracy was in the hospital when his name was announced, so his wife accepted the Oscar for him. This was the first time anyone had ever seen his wife.See this film.

276494,A2A9BGJ6FFBBDT,6301965957,"Magalini Sabina ""sabina""","[4, 4]","Rudyard Kipling died in 1936. He had never allowed transposition of his writings to the theatre or to the movies for fear of misinterpretation. This is just what happenend in 1937 when Victor Fleming with the aid of the script writers John Lee Mahin, Marc Connelly and Dale Van Every directed the Academy Award winning ""Captains Courageous"" with an Oscar winning Spencer Tracy, the foremost child actor of the moment Freddie Bartholomew, the great arthritis striken Lionel Barrymore, the elegant and algid Melvyn Douglas and John Carradine. A little part was played by Micky Rooney that would later become a Hollywood star on his own. The movie was immensely popular in 1937 and became more so with the passing of the years and still has an enormous appeal today.The movie's plot is well known and can be read in other reviews. I want to focus on what fascinates me most: how movies interpret books and to what extent time and circumstances influence this relationship.VF ""Captains Courageous"" is something different from Kipling's novel.The plot is ""inspired by"" the novel and apparently similar and the setting is consistent, but the meanings conveyed by the two works are quite different. True, this is a story about growing up and son-father relationship but the creation of the character of Manuel Fidello (that plays only a small part in the book) and his substitution of Disko Troop as Harvey's father figure and of Dan as Harvey's brother in arms changes for Kipling readers the story's meaning. The Portugese Manuel is evidently a Roman Catholic, and at moments he embodies the figure of Christ the Savior. Many references to Catholic religion are evident throughout: Manuel's sacrifice to save the ship and Harvey, his allusions to Christ's apostels as fisherman, his conception of Paradise like a dorie were he can fish with his father. He is evidently Harvey's saviour and guardian angel, whereas in the book this figure is embodied by the black cook who will later follow Harvey in his adult life. Hollywood in 1937 was probably not ready to assign such a role to an Afro-American and preferred to have a Portugese. Kipling had no propensions toward Roman Catholic religion other than those that were part of his enduring curiosity towards all ethnical and religious differences.Kipling's novel is rigidly constructed to highlight Harvey's transferral to adulthood and the only emotional moments are when during the Memorial Day Ceremony the sailors that have died at sea are mentioned. In this closing episode a sense of angst grips the reader but I doubt anybody reading the book sheds a tear.The movie instead is construceted as a tear-jerker, the many cords of affection between Manuel and Harvey are played before the must part. So when the moment comes, emotion is unleashed and catharsis is there to satisfy the audience.The sense of death as a natural and acceptable consequence of human experience, that Kipling was so keen to comunicate throughout his novel, is somehow respected even if the longing for Manuel remains even after the movie ends.All this is to point out how an author's work can be alterated to a different meaning. If this is right or wrong, its not for me to say.Victor Fleming's Captain Courageous is a beatiful movie that still retains today its emotional value. It also has the great merit of helping visualize the novel. In the outdoor settings it is perfectly true to the book: the fogs on the banks, the images of the nautical charts, the dories, the schooner and the fishes...and the fish cleaning...are so very real. The boat race between Disko and the Jenny Champion is not in the book, where Disko is such a great cod fisher that he finishes first and gets back to Gloucester one week before his rivals. The Disko of the book would have never engaged such a dangerous and stupid race that costs Manuel's life. However the filming of these scenes is fantastic and one has the impression of looking at the America's Cup. The scene in which Manuel dies has been faithfully reproduced in ""Titanic"" (cinematic cross-reference).Spencer Tracy's interpretation of Manuel is practically all his own because the character is almost abstent in the book, where his only important scenes are when he rescues Harvey and when he accepts only five dollars from Cheyne senior for having saved his son.Harvey's character also is given a different interpretation. In the book he is only an arrogant spoiled adolescent (remember he is fifteen) in the movie he is a manipulator and a cheat and harder to like, so his redemption is harder too.One point that is strictly in favour of the movie is the dialogue. Kipling's book has been accused of beeing cryptical, because it's written for the most part in fisherman's dialect. Maybe this is so, but if one still reads Captains Courageous today he or she will willingly put up with a few notes. In the movie the dialect is respected, but it appears as a spoken language and as such is much more comprehensible.Another key feature is the music, with Manuel's hurdy gurdy in the first place and the unforgettable song ""Little fish don't cry"".Victor Fleming respects Kiplings exclusively male world (in the movie even Harvey's mother is dead) with men that desire to escape from the realm of women and domestic oblgations to attain real freedom. This director, universally famous also for other movies, contributed so much to the American popular culture that today we take for granted many of intuitions such as that of childhood as a moment to live out with risks and in wilderness.The occasions of making these observations in the presence of two great works of art is intriguing. Neither the book nor the movie loose value in the comparison, they are only different and the difference represents the essence of dated rereadings of masterpieces.I suggest to read the book before watching the movie to give better wings to your imagination.",5,"Captains Courageous: the movie and the book, two different works of art",1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,5916,"['Rudyard', 'Kipling',

It's a great movie, but if you are a Mickey Rooney fan you will be sorry not to see him in the movie often.",3,Not Enough Mickey Rooney,1101081600,"11 22, 2004",2004,619,"['movie', 'great', 'story', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'part', 'film', 'only', 'seen', 'couple', 'times', 'brief', 'moment', 'bought', 'film', 'hoping', 'see', 'more', 'favorite', 'actor', 'was', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'just', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'best', 'performances', 'So', 'are', 'Tracy', 'fan', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Freddie', 'Barthomew', 'was', 'outstanding', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'So', 'say', 'say', 'great', 'movie', 'are', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'fan', 'will', 'be', 'sorry', 'not', 'see', 'movie', 'often']",N/A
276516,A2GJ98824GGXGP,6301965957,Timothy Kearney,"[5, 5]","I remember overhearing a conversation that included my father and other men around his age talking about the movies they loved as young people. All of them agreed that one film was perhaps the greatest film of their youth: CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS. I think it's easy to see why this is the case. The story may be old fashioned and this one time classic is hardly read anymore, but the story of young Harvey Cheyne coming of age aboard a Gloucester fishing schooner has a way at tugging at the heart and if given the chance, people can change.On of the reasons the film works so well is the acting. Depression era child star Freddie Bartholomew plays the incorrigible Harvey. Bartholomew plays the role with great skill. He's miserable enough that we're glad when he finally falls overboard, yet sympathetic enough that we are glad he does get rescued. The transformation is believable and by the films end, we begin to believe in Harvey and even grow to like him. Spencer Tracy won an Oscar as Manuel, the Portuguese fisherman who in some ways becomes the only true father figure Harvey has ever known. Today Tracy would never get away with playing a Portuguese fisherman with his Irish looks and somewhat clumsy attempt at an accent, yet his skill in portraying his character is undisputed. Lionel Barrymore is perfectly cast as the old salt New England sea captain Disko Troop. Mickey Rooney is somewhat underused as the captain's son Dan. My guess is that if the film were made a few years later when Rooney became a matinee idol, he would not be cast in such a small role or the role would be expanded.While a great cast carries the film, there are also smaller details that make the film powerful. The original sea shanties add a certain flavor. The special effects of the sea are magnificent for their time, and the sailing scenes are stupendous. This was no small feat in the 1930's. The film certainly is a timeless classic. People who purchase this DVD will also love the bonus features; trailers of the 1946 re-release, a short film THE LITTLE MAESTRO and a cartoon LITTLE BICK CHEESER.",5,A True Classic,1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,2091,"['remember', 'overhearing', 'conversation', 'included', 'father', 'other', 'men', 'age', 'talking', 'movies', 'loved', 'young', 'people', 'agreed', 'one', 'film', 'was', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'film', 'youth', 'CAPTAINS', 'COURAGEOUS', 'think', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'case', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'old', 'fashioned', 'one', 'time', 'classic', 'hardly', 'read', 'anymore', 'story', 'young', 'Harvey', 'Cheyne', 'coming', 'age', 'Gloucester', 'fishing', 'schooner', 'way', 'tugging', 'heart', 'given', 'chance', 'people', 'can', 'change.On', 'reasons', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'acting', 'Depression', 'era', 'child', 'star', 'Freddie', 'Bartholomew', 'incorrigible', 'Harvey', 'Bartholomew', 'role', 'great', 'skill', 'miserable', 'enough', ""'re"", 'glad', 'when', 'finally', 'overboard', 'yet', 'sympathetic', 'enough', 'are', 'glad', 'get', 'rescued', 'transformation', 'believable', 'films', 'end', 'begin', 'believe', 'Harvey', 'even', 'grow', 'like', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Manuel', 'Portuguese', 'fisherman', 'who', 'ways', 'only', 'true', 'father', 'figure', 'Harvey', 'ever', 'known', 'Today', 'Tracy', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'away', 'playing', 'Portuguese', 'fisherman', 'Irish', 'looks', 'somewhat', 'clumsy', 'attempt', 'accent', 'yet', 'skill', 'portraying', 'character', 'undisputed', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'old', 'salt', 'New', 'England', 'sea', 'captain', 'Disko', 'Troop', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'somewhat', 'underused', 'captain', 'son', 'Dan', 'guess', 'film', 'were', 'made', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'Rooney', 'became', 'matinee', 'idol', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'cast', 'such', 'small', 'role', 'role', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'cast', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'smaller', 'details', 'make', 'film', 'powerful', 'original', 'sea', 'shanties', 'add', 'certain', 'flavor', 'special', 'effects', 'sea', 'are', 'magnificent', 'time', 'sailing', 'scenes', 'are', 'stupendous', 'was', 'small', 'feat', '1930', 'film', 'certainly', 'timeless', 'classic', 'People', 'who', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'will', 'also', 'love', 'bonus', 'trailers', '1946', 're-release', 'short', 'film', 'THE', 'LITTLE', 'MAESTRO', 'cartoon', 'LITTLE', 'BICK', 'CHEESER']",N/A
276517,A1C80B497LCYKA,6301965957,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[4, 4]","Rudyard Kipling's classic boy's tale of the sea is inhabited by Freddy Bartholomew as spoiled rich boy Harvey, Spencer Tracy as compassionate fisherman Manuel, Lionel Barrymore as good-natured Captain Disko, and Melvyn Douglas as Harvey's negligent father. Freddy Bartholomew, who received top billing in this film, is perhaps the best child actor who has ever lived, simply because he really seems to be acting rather than just looking cute. Spencer Tracy, who won the Oscar for Best Actor for his role, is one of the best adult actors of all time. As if that weren't enough, Lionel Barrymore (It's a Wonderful Life) and Melvyn Douglas (Ninotchka, Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House) are two of the top character actors. And, to top it off, you've got John Carradine and Mickey Rooney in supporting roles. You can't beat the story or the cast.Victor Flemming (Wizard Of Oz, Gone With The Wind, The Good Earth) did a superb job directing his talented cast and crew through the John Lee Mahin/Marc Connelly/Dale Van Every screenplay, which tells the story of how a spoiled rich boy, out of sorts with himself and the world, falls off a cruise ship into the sea, and is fished out by a friendly Portuguese fisherman named Manuel. Once on board Manuel's fishing schooner, Harvey learns he won't be able to return to shore for three months, until the fishermen have finished their season of fishing. At first he fights his plight; but through the love and patience of Manuel, Harvey soon learns to fit in and become a contributing member of the crew. He makes mistakes; but Manuel helps him learn and eventually grow into a boy of character.This is a great father-son film. It's also a wonderful film about the sea and sailing. There are some breathtaking shots of ships, especially during a race between two schooners. There are some wonderful relationships. It's interesting to see how each adult deals with Harvey, and how each changes in that relationship as Harvey changes. One of the best scenes of the film, and the one that got to me the most, is at the very end, when Harvey is going home with his dad. First we see the dinghy in which Harvey and Manuel fished being pulled behind his dad's car. Harvey couldn't bear to part with it, so his dad brought it with them. Then the camera pans to the back of the car, where we see Harvey and his dad in the back seat through the window. Harvey is animated with enthusiasm as he is obviously telling his dad about all his adventures - even to the point of exaggerating the size of the first fish he caught. It's a great final statement about the difference an experience like that and a friend like Manuel can make in a boy's life.Waitsel Smith",5,SPENCER TRACY AND THE SEA ACT AS SURROGATE FATHERS TO FREDDY BARTHOLOMEW,1161734400,"10 25, 2006",2006,2694,"['Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'classic', 'boy', 'tale', 'sea', 'inhabited', 'Freddy', 'Bartholomew', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'boy', 'Harvey', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'compassionate', 'fisherman', 'Manuel', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'good-natured', 'Captain', 'Disko', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'Harvey', 'negligent', 'father', 'Freddy', 'Bartholomew', 'who', 'received', 'top', 'billing', 'film', 'perhaps', 'best', 'child', 'actor', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', 'simply', 'really', 'be', 'acting', 'rather', 'just', 'looking', 'cute', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', 'role', 'one', 'best', 'adult', 'actors', 'time', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'Ninotchka', 'Mr.', 'Blandings', 'Builds', 'Dream', 'House', 'are', 'two', 'top', 'character', 'actors', 'top', 'off', ""'ve"", 'got', 'John', 'Carradine', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'supporting', 'roles', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'story', 'cast.Victor', 'Flemming', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Good', 'Earth', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'directing', 'talented', 'cast', 'crew', 'John', 'Lee', 'Mahin/Marc', 'Connelly/Dale', 'Van', 'Every', 'screenplay', 'story', 'how', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'boy', 'sorts', 'world', 'cruise', 'ship', 'sea', 'fished', 'out', 'friendly', 'Portuguese', 'fisherman', 'named', 'Manuel', 'Once', 'board', 'Manuel', 'fishing', 'schooner', 'Harvey', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'return', 'shore', 'three', 'months', 'fishermen', 'have', 'finished', 'season', 'fishing', 'first', 'plight', 'love', 'patience', 'Manuel', 'Harvey', 'soon', 'fit', 'become', 'contributing', 'member', 'crew', 'mistakes', 'Manuel', 'learn', 'eventually', 'grow', 'boy', 'character.This', 'great', 'father-son', 'film', 'also', 'wonderful', 'film', 'sea', 'sailing', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'shots', 'ships', 'especially', 'race', 'two', 'schooners', 'are', 'wonderful', 'relationships', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'adult', 'deals', 'Harvey', 'how', 'changes', 'relationship', 'Harvey', 'changes', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'one', 'got', 'most', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'Harvey', 'going', 'home', 'dad', 'First', 'see', 'dinghy', 'Harvey', 'Manuel', 'fished', 'being', 'pulled', 'dad', 'car', 'Harvey', 'could', ""n't"", 'bear', 'part', 'dad', 'brought', 'Then', 'camera', 'back', 'car', 'where', 'see', 'Harvey', 'dad', 'back', 'seat', 'window', 'Harvey', 'animated', 'enthusiasm', 'obviously', 'telling', 'dad', 'adventures', 'even', 'point', 'exaggerating', 'size', 'first', 'fish', 'caught', 'great', 'final', 'statement', 'difference', 'experience', 'friend', 'Manuel', 'can', 'make', 'boy', 'life.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A
