Good performance by Bette. She had to play a much younger woman so it was fun to see how well they photographed her to accomplish this. For the most part she really did look younger but other places you could see that she really did look all of 42. Touching movie. Lots of great hats by the ladies throughout and Edith Head really gives Bette some great gowns to wear. (Though, NOT the party scene gown!) And that hairdo! She looked 60!In regards to the changed ending of the film....well, it worked for me.Maybe the original was better (it was changed before release) BUT my goodness we have enough great cynical works out there in art and in life!Why 4 stars....Well, All About Eve is 5 stars!...naturally",4,"yeah, finally out on DVD",1239494400,"04 12, 2009",2009,815,"[""'ve"", 'waited', '20', 'years', 'finally', 'see', 'good', 'copy', 'film', 'Very', 'crisp', 'realease', 'Strangely', 'touching', 'Good', 'performance', 'Bette', 'had', 'play', 'much', 'younger', 'woman', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'photographed', 'accomplish', 'most', 'part', 'really', 'did', 'look', 'younger', 'other', 'places', 'could', 'see', 'really', 'did', 'look', '42', 'Touching', 'movie', 'Lots', 'great', 'hats', 'ladies', 'Edith', 'Head', 'really', 'Bette', 'great', 'gowns', 'wear', 'Though', 'NOT', 'party', 'scene', 'gown', 'hairdo', 'looked', '60', 'regards', 'changed', 'ending', 'film', '.well', 'worked', 'me.Maybe', 'original', 'was', 'better', 'was', 'changed', 'release', 'BUT', 'goodness', 'have', 'enough', 'great', 'cynical', 'out', 'there', 'art', 'life', 'Why', '4', 'stars', '.Well', 'Eve', '5', 'stars', 'naturally']",Payment on Demand

I even have the very rare 'Another Man's Poison' and a remastered version of 'Of Human Bondage' on DVD. I had never seen Payment on Demand and was wildly excited to get it in the mail.It is a good film. It is not one of Davis' most memorable however. There isn't enough of her extraordinary acting ability in it. She plays it safe in this, for the most part. Still, she can get tears out of you at the end when she weeps in the car.The picture quality is absolutely superb, as is the sound.I recommend this to seasoned Davis collectors, but not for a new fan. This is not going to grab a ""newbie"" in any profound way. For that, I would recommend 'Now Voyager', 'The Letter' or 'All About Eve.'",3,Good and rare.

But not even the ever-resourceful Bette can salvage this misbegotten effort.

But rather than allow it end as it logically should, the producers decided to tack-on a brazenly unbelievable ""hopeful ending""...presumably to satisfy the primarily female matinee audiences of the day.

1251353,A11CYNCILLSRZ8,B00269OW66,Robert L. Anderson,"[14, 18]","I have waited 35 years for this film to come out on Vcr or otherwise. There is talk of TV eposodes being 'a lost eposode. Well I think that this is a great 'lost Bette Davis movie'. I seen it in the show when I was very young and many years later on national television. But that was in the 50's or 60's. But I always remembered this film and thought it was just as goog (if not bettet) than her most populer films. Barry Sullivan who played her husband in the film was also great as was the two young ladies who played her daughters. Especially Betty Lynn. I believe Betty Lynn and Bette remained lifelong friends after they did this movie togrther. I go on and out in saying 'movie' and 'film', because when I was a kid they were all 'movies'. Especially for movie fans.This movie ""Payment On Demand"" about a very controlling woman said so much. That everybody eventually will walk away. If it be in the homeor on the job or in friendships or relationships. A controlling bitch is intolerable. Sooner or later  they all lose what means most to them in the end. In many of Bette Davis's films she portrayedwomen of very bad character defects and there was a lesson to be learned in watching her films. If you could 'get it!'. Yes the ending of the film was sort of leaving you hanging, but it was okay. You can't expect a husband to take their wife back after she nearling ruined his life in so many ways. At least not right away. Yeah, ""Payment On Demand"" is one of my all time favorite Bette Davis movies.
