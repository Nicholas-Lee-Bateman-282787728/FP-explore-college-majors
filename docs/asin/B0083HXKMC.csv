1545192,ADJ9W8DJJKDJO,B0083HXKMC,Erika Young,"[6, 7]","The main theme in the saga is infidelity, which was a big deal in 19th century England, but for some reason the cheaters are favored by the author and portrayed as saintly heroes acting in pursuit of true love, and the wronged spouses especially Soames are portrayed as uptight or outright villains. It is especially annoying that the character of Irene, who obviously married Soames for his money, then treated him with disgust their whole marriage and ran off with another man, is treated by everyone as the most moral and desirable woman in the family.The scenes are filmed in beautiful locations with 19th century and early 20th century gorgeous costumes, furnishings and lots of horse drawn carriages and so are delightful to watch. However, one strange element is that even though the saga stretches over more than 50 years, the adult actors never change their appearance at all; they look exactly the same in their 20's as they do in their 70's. Their children are born and grow into adults and the result is that the actors playing the adult children look almost the same age as their old parents.  There could have been at least an attempt at making the old characters have grey hair or some other signs of age, but alas, nothing was done at all.",4,"Well done enjoyable series, with some reservations",1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,1255,"['main', 'theme', 'saga', 'infidelity', 'was', 'big', 'deal', '19th', 'century', 'England', 'reason', 'cheaters', 'are', 'favored', 'author', 'portrayed', 'saintly', 'acting', 'pursuit', 'true', 'love', 'wronged', 'spouses', 'especially', 'Soames', 'are', 'portrayed', 'uptight', 'outright', 'villains', 'especially', 'annoying', 'character', 'Irene', 'who', 'obviously', 'married', 'Soames', 'money', 'then', 'treated', 'whole', 'marriage', 'ran', 'off', 'man', 'treated', 'everyone', 'most', 'moral', 'desirable', 'woman', 'family.The', 'scenes', 'are', 'filmed', 'beautiful', 'locations', '19th', 'century', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'gorgeous', 'costumes', 'furnishings', 'lots', 'horse', 'drawn', 'carriages', 'so', 'are', 'delightful', 'watch', 'However', 'one', 'strange', 'element', 'even', 'saga', 'more', '50', 'years', 'adult', 'actors', 'never', 'change', 'appearance', 'look', 'exactly', 'same', '20', 'do', '70', 'children', 'are', 'born', 'grow', 'adults', 'result', 'actors', 'playing', 'adult', 'children', 'look', 'almost', 'same', 'age', 'old', 'parents', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'attempt', 'making', 'old', 'characters', 'have', 'grey', 'hair', 'other', 'signs', 'age', 'alas', 'nothing', 'was', 'done']",N/A

I've owned the series on DVD for a decade. It's been watched repeatedly. Now sets are combined for this release. Stars of this series have grown to be mega stars in other series. It caused me to buy the John Galsworthy novels. The adaptation isn't perfect; no miniseries is, even though this attempt allows much, being over 700 minutes (near 12 hours).Series 1 had 6 episodes, series 2 had 4. All have CC for the hearing impaired.Two 1870s Forsyte men are conflicting opposite cousins who enjoy the upper middle class living as much as the next. Soames (Damian Lewis) is the abandoning wife, artist, loose, cruel man. Jolyon (Rupert Graves -Garrow's Law) is the posh lawyer, proper, and lover of Irene (Gina McKee -Borgias, Notting Hill) who does a stellar role. Soames daughter Fleur (Emma Griffiths Malin) is a big part of his life and the story in both series 1&2. Amanda Root and Alistair Petrie (Cranford) also appear in all 10 episodes. Offspring take the lead in the second series which takes viewers to the Roaring 20s, based on the book, ""To Let.""This series is done in theatre style (my terminology) where scenes roll longer, not flashing away in seconds. That allows drama to unfold through excellent acting and dialogue, not special camera effects. To me, that's the only way to shoot a saga, a telling of lives over decades. One must get to know characters. There was a larger, longer, Forsyte book adaptation series with more episodes, covering more of the books. It was the 1960s, B&W; only. Some may try to compare, as they will try to compare this miniseries with the books, but it's best to just sit back and enjoy this as an innovative, colorful, very compelling, UK period drama of a era gone by, but created for us on film in such a beautiful manner. The locations are, well...WOW. Costumes authentic. It's a step back in time, a thirty-year time travel of sorts.Expect moving emotion. It's a lot of viewing, but you will find it hard to pause between episodes. A keeper for the Brit Period Drama shelf of the home library.

1545197,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B0083HXKMC,Jon Wynne,"[0, 0]","Sumptuous, romantic, compelling.  The list of adjectives that could be compiled to describe this brilliant adaptation of the &#8220;Forsyte&#8221; novels of John Galsworthy would be lengthy indeed.  If your cup of tea is period drama, this high-class soap opera will quench your thirst.The long shadow of the 1967 version of Galsworthy&#8217;s magnum opus has finally been matched (if not eclipsed) with this lovingly-produced series that presents multiple generations of the Forsyte family, a family of considerable means and flaws in late 19th-Century and early 20th-Century England.A bit of history is needed to fully appreciate the achievement of this production.  In 1967, when Galsworthy&#8217;s novels were first serialized, THE FORSYTE SAGA became such a smash hit first in the U.K. and then in North America, that peoples&#8217; social lives were impacted.  It was even the first BBC serial to be sold to the Soviet Union.  During its second broadcast in the U.K. on Sunday evenings extending into 1969, the final episode attracted some 18 million viewers.  While not in the same league as the Davy Crockett craze of the mid-1950s (when every boy in America had a &#8216;coon-skin cap), one must remember that the saga of the Forsytes is a period drama, not an historical adventure.  Programs like this aren&#8217;t expected to be this popular.  Yet that is precisely what it became.  Though wrongly attributed to be the first BBC soap opera, it was nonetheless the first mega-hit soap.  All this to say that it was inevitable that such a legendary production, drawn from such rich source material, should be made again, especially in light of the one flaw in the original version&#8211;the fact that it was one of the last major BBC productions to be shot in black and white video.It isn&#8217;t always possible to say this, but here it is wholly applicable: &#8220;Thank Heaven for re-makes!&#8221;At the centre of this panoramic family history is the conflicted, fascinating character of Soames Forsyte, played to perfection by Damian Lewis.  Considering Lewis was preceded by the great Eric Porter in the &#8217;67 version (and Errol Flynn in a 1949 film adaptation!) this is high praise indeed.  Rupert Everett also stars as cousin Jolyon Forsyte, the black sheep of the family whose estrangement from the &#8220;respectable&#8221; Forsytes provides the basic foundation of the series.  Of the plethora of outstanding performances Corin Redgrave particularly, as Old Jolyon, is simply wonderful.  He should&#8217;ve won an award for his subtle, layered performance.  The only sour note in the acting department is the over-the-top caricaturing by Michael Maloney, who can&#8217;t seem to play any role straight and always seems to be winking at the audience with an &#8220;aren&#8217;t I clever&#8221; look about him.  This is a minor aberration in a splendid company of artists.Production values are very high and there is rarely a false note, though the occasional use of distorted, almost &#8220;fish-eye&#8221; close-ups in the first series was a bit off-putting.  Such shots seemed &#8220;modern&#8221; and out of keeping with the look and feel of a period drama which has otherwise been so effectively realized.Series 1 of THE FORSYTE SAGA is six 70-minute episodes.  Series 2 is four episodes.  You&#8217;ll want to immerse yourself as the series&#8217; charm works its magic.  It is well worth the investment of your time.One final thought: if the final shot of Damian Lewis as Soames Forsyte doesn&#8217;t move you, you are made of stone.  Lewis doesn&#8217;t say a word, but his silent statement speaks volumes.",5,Sumptuous.,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,3635,"['Sumptuous', 'romantic', 'compelling', 'list', 'adjectives', 'could', 'be', 'compiled', 'describe', 'brilliant', 'adaptation', '8220', 'Forsyte', '8221', 'novels', 'John', 'Galsworthy', 'would', 'be', 'lengthy', 'indeed', 'cup', 'tea', 'period', 'drama', 'high-class', 'soap', 'opera', 'will', 'quench', 'thirst.The', 'long', 'shadow', '1967', 'version', 'Galsworthy', '8217', 'magnum', 'opus', 'finally', 'been', 'matched', 'not', 'eclipsed', 'lovingly-produced', 'series', 'multiple', 'generations', 'Forsyte', 'family', 'family', 'considerable', 'means', 'flaws', 'late', '19th-Century', 'early', '20th-Century', 'England.A', 'bit', 'history', 'needed', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'achievement', 'production', '1967', 'when', 'Galsworthy', '8217', 's', 'novels', 'were', 'first', 'serialized', 'FORSYTE', 'SAGA', 'became', 'such', 'smash', 'hit', 'first', 'U.K.', 'then', 'North', 'America', '8217', 'social', 'lives', 'were', 'impacted', 'was', 'even', 'first', 'BBC', 'serial', 'be', 'sold', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'second', 'broadcast', 'U.K.', 'Sunday', 'evenings', 'extending', '1969', 'final', 'episode', 'attracted', '18', 'million', 'viewers', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'craze', 'mid-1950s', 'when', 'boy', 'America', 'had', '8216', 'coon-skin', 'cap', 'one', 'must', 'remember', 'saga', 'Forsytes', 'period', 'drama', 'not', 'historical', 'adventure', 'Programs', 'aren', '8217', 'expected', 'be', 'popular', 'precisely', 'what', 'became', 'wrongly', 'attributed', 'be', 'first', 'BBC', 'soap', 'opera', 'was', 'nonetheless', 'first', 'mega-hit', 'soap', 'say', 'was', 'inevitable', 'legendary', 'production', 'drawn', 'such', 'rich', 'source', 'material', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'again', 'especially', 'light', 'one', 'flaw', 'original', 'version', '8211', 'fact', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'major', 'BBC', 'productions', 'be', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'video.It', 'isn', '8217', 'always', 'possible', 'say', 'here', 'wholly', 'applicable', '8220', 'Thank', 'Heaven', 're-makes', '8221', 'centre', 'panoramic', 'family', 'history', 'conflicted', 'fascinating', 'character', 'Soames', 'Forsyte', 'played', 'perfection', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'Considering', 'Lewis', 'was', 'preceded', 'great', 'Eric', 'Porter', '8217', '67', 'version', 'Errol', 'Flynn', '1949', 'film', 'adaptation', 'high', 'praise', 'indeed', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'also', 'cousin', 'Jolyon', 'Forsyte', 'black', 'sheep', 'family', 'estrangement', '8220', 'respectable', '8221', 'Forsytes', 'basic', 'foundation', 'series', 'plethora', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Corin', 'Redgrave', 'particularly', 'Old', 'Jolyon', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'should', '8217', 'won', 'award', 'subtle', 'layered', 'performance', 'only', 'sour', 'note', 'acting', 'department', 'over-the-top', 'caricaturing', 'Michael', 'Maloney', 'who', 'can', '8217', 'seem', 'play', 'role', 'straight', 'always', 'be', 'winking', 'audience', '8220', '8217', 'clever', '8221', 'look', 'minor', 'aberration', 'splendid', 'company', 'artists.Production', 'values', 'are', 'very', 'high', 'rarely', 'false', 'note', 'occasional', 'use', 'distorted', 'almost', '8220', 'fish-eye', '8221', 'close-ups', 'first', 'series', 'was', 'bit', 'off-putting', 'Such', 'shots', 'seemed', '8220', 'modern', '8221', 'keeping', 'look', 'feel', 'period', 'drama', 'otherwise', 'been', 'so', 'effectively', '1', 'THE', 'FORSYTE', 'SAGA', 'six', '70-minute', 'episodes', 'Series', '2', 'four', 'episodes', '8217', 'want', 'immerse', 'series', '8217', 'charm', 'magic', 'well', 'investment', 'time.One', 'final', 'thought', 'final', 'shot', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'Soames', 'Forsyte', 'doesn', '8217', 'move', 'are', 'made', 'stone', 'Lewis', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'say', 'word', 'silent', 'statement', 'speaks', 'volumes']",N/A

If you already own them, this is not an upgrade with new content and there is no reason to repurchase.  This is for those new to the show, you can buy both parts together.Previously released in two installments, ""The Forsyte Saga"" is finally being compiled in its entirety.  The first six-part Masterpiece Theater miniseries was presented in 2002 with the second story arc of four episodes airing in 2003.  Based on the works of John Galsworthy, this isn't the first time British TV tackled this epic family drama.  A BBC production of the same name debuted in 1967, ran for 26 episodes, and figured in both the 1968 BAFTA and the 1970 Emmy races (after it premiered stateside).  Some will contend that this original presentation is better or more complete and with a considerably longer running time, I'd be hard pressed to disagree with this assessment.  Be that as it may, I think this interpretation of ""The Forsyte Saga"" fully stands on its own as a top-notch entertainment.  A great cast (led by the tremendous Damian Lewis) brings this multigenerational story to life, and it is an absolute must-own for lovers of sophisticated adult drama.  While I've seen Lewis excel in everything from ""Band of Brothers"" to the current ""Homeland,"" this is ultimately the role and character that I most quickly associate him with.  He's truly that memorable!The tale initially centers around Lewis (as Soames Forsyte) and his cousin Jolyon played by Rupert Graves near the end of the 1800s (the story is set over several decades).  The two cousins are left to carry on the Forsyte legacy, but the two men couldn't be more different.  Lewis plays Soames as a tight wire act, upright and controlling, while Graves is given a more impulsive and carefree nature.  But it is Gina McKee, playing the woman that catches Lewis's eye, that serves as the primary driving force for the early episodes.  In fact, it is the relationship between these two that really stands out.  Convinced he loves her, the two are wed before he can realize he doesn't really know her.  And I'm not convinced he wants to know her, he just wants to possess her.  Their tumultuous marriage becomes a virtual battleground and Lewis becomes increasingly brutal and petty.  In a finely nuanced performance, though, Lewis never alienates the audience with his villainy.  You fully understand him even as he crosses all lines of propriety.  Eventually the two will be pushed further apart and she will befriend Graves, but even apart--the story of these two is the catalyst to almost everything that happens.I absolutely loved the first six episode miniseries.  McGee and Lewis are incredible.  However, as the second series of four episodes takes center stage, another generation of Forsytes arrive.  Centered principally around the children in the 1920s, the tale has Lewis's daughter taking a liking to Grave's son (I won't divulge where McKee stands at this point).  It appears that mistakes from the past seem destined to plague Lewis, once again, as his precious daughter starts to distance herself.  Although a worthy successor, I wasn't as captivated by this series as the previous one.
