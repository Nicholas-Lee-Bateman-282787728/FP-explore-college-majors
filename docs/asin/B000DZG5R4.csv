Passing in and out of his orbit are Juliet Prowse as a repressed wannabe actress, Jan Murray as a widower of a sex-crime victim, and Elaine Stritch as a closet lesbian.  Unfortunately, Prowse gets more chance to prance than Mineo (or does it just seem that way?)

963769,AB9Q52OYE7E6N,B000DZG5R4,"G. Schneider ""old movie buff""","[11, 11]","First caveat: beware the VHS version offered through Amazon Marketplace. I bought this and discovered it to be a homemade copy of a copy of a VHS original, with no documentation. The picture quality is dreadful.That said, the movie is very interesting. True, it's trashy, but fascinating. It's a shame that the 60s were so naive! All that good stuff that they couldn't actually say or show...but my, they certainly hinted! Unless the version I had was censored, I see nothing revealing or titillating about the swimming pool scene. However, in an earlier scene Mineo is wearing white jeans that show more than ample equipment.Sal Mineo has somehow gained the reputation of being a trashy actor. Why, I don't know. Jimmy Dean may well have been a genius, but for my money, it's Sal Mineo's performance in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE that makes the movie. THE GENE KRUPA STORY has its weaknesses (not least of which is that, over a 40-year span of time no one ages a day!), but Sal is not one of them. His performance is strong throughout. In GIANT apparently his best stuff was destined for the cutting-room floor before it was even filmed, since director George Stevens wanted him on board only for marquee value. I gather it worked: Sal's fans paid their money...and then got two minutes of him onscreen. Can you say ""Rip-off""? (I thought you could.)There are so many movies worthy of DVD treatment that get neglected while anything made recently gets the full DVD marketing. It's a shame.

963771,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B000DZG5R4,Kasey G,"[1, 1]","**NOTE - THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**For the past several years, I've wanted to get my hands on a copy of the rare 1965 film ""Who Killed Teddy Bear?"". A few months ago I found a cheap bootleg copy and snapped it up, finally popping it in the DVD player last night.Was it worth the wait? Well, I'm not sorry I watched it, but it wasn't the must-see I was expecting.In 1965 New York, Juliet Prowse spins the latest records at a nightclub managed by Elaine Stritch. Poor Juliet becomes the target of a telephone stalker and a police detective who specializes in psychosexual criminal behaviour takes it upon himself to protect her.Nothing too exciting happens until the middle of the film when Sal Mineo is introduced as a busboy at the club who has a mentally-challenged sister to take care of. There is an obtuse flashback that shows the little girl falling down the stairs after Sal leaves her unattended to go make out with a strange girl who stands in the doorway flirting with him. (Oddly, the girl looks like Mineo himself in drag.)Next Stritch tries to put some lesbian moves on Prowse, who promptly throws her out of the apartment with Stritch only clad in her bra and slip and Prowse's fur coat. Even though Stritch is at least 20 years older, Mineo mistakes her for Prowse and ends up strangling Stritch on a rooftop. This is the first time I've seen Elaine Stritch in anything, having heard of her because she auditioned for the Bea Arthur role of Dorothy in ""The Golden Girls"".The most famous thing about the film is probably the scene where Mineo works out at the Y in skimpy square-cut swim trunks, not an ounce of fat on his tight, compact frame.We have a montage of a sexually-frustated Mineo lurking about dirty bookstores and peep shows before he ends up back at the nightclub after-hours with Prowse, who teaches him to dance with wild abandon.They whip themselves into such a frenzy that Mineo tries to violate Prowse until the cop puts the pieces together and arrives to save her while slapping the daylights out of Mineo, who flees and runs through traffic until he is shot down.I found this film to encapsulate all the elements of those lurid pulp novels of the '50s and '60s.It's no masterpiece but interesting as a time capsule and for Mineo in his prime.",4,Lurid Mid-60s Pulp Fiction Brought to Life,1286755200,"10 11, 2010",2010,2281,"['**NOTE', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS**For', 'past', 'several', 'years', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'get', 'hands', 'copy', 'rare', '1965', 'film', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Teddy', 'Bear', 'few', 'months', 'found', 'cheap', 'bootleg', 'copy', 'snapped', 'up', 'finally', 'popping', 'DVD', 'player', 'last', 'night.Was', 'wait', 'Well', ""'m"", 'not', 'sorry', 'watched', 'was', ""n't"", 'must-see', 'was', 'expecting.In', '1965', 'New', 'York', 'Juliet', 'Prowse', 'latest', 'records', 'nightclub', 'managed', 'Elaine', 'Stritch', 'Poor', 'Juliet', 'target', 'telephone', 'stalker', 'police', 'detective', 'who', 'psychosexual', 'criminal', 'behaviour', 'protect', 'her.Nothing', 'too', 'exciting', 'happens', 'middle', 'film', 'when', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'introduced', 'busboy', 'club', 'who', 'mentally-challenged', 'sister', 'take', 'care', 'obtuse', 'flashback', 'little', 'girl', 'falling', 'down', 'stairs', 'Sal', 'unattended', 'go', 'make', 'out', 'strange', 'girl', 'who', 'doorway', 'flirting', 'Oddly', 'girl', 'looks', 'Mineo', 'drag', 'Next', 'Stritch', 'put', 'lesbian', 'moves', 'Prowse', 'who', 'promptly', 'apartment', 'Stritch', 'only', 'bra', 'slip', 'Prowse', 'fur', 'coat', 'Even', 'Stritch', 'least', '20', 'years', 'older', 'Mineo', 'Prowse', 'up', 'strangling', 'Stritch', 'rooftop', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Elaine', 'Stritch', 'anything', 'having', 'heard', 'auditioned', 'Bea', 'Arthur', 'role', 'Dorothy', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'most', 'famous', 'thing', 'film', 'probably', 'scene', 'where', 'Mineo', 'out', 'Y', 'skimpy', 'square-cut', 'swim', 'trunks', 'not', 'ounce', 'fat', 'tight', 'compact', 'frame.We', 'have', 'montage', 'sexually-frustated', 'Mineo', 'lurking', 'dirty', 'bookstores', 'peep', 'shows', 'up', 'back', 'nightclub', 'after-hours', 'Prowse', 'who', 'dance', 'wild', 'abandon.They', 'whip', 'frenzy', 'Mineo', 'violate', 'Prowse', 'cop', 'pieces', 'together', 'save', 'slapping', 'daylights', 'Mineo', 'who', 'traffic', 'shot', 'down.I', 'found', 'film', 'encapsulate', 'elements', 'lurid', 'pulp', 'novels', ""'50s"", 'masterpiece', 'interesting', 'time', 'capsule', 'Mineo', 'prime']",Who Killed Teddy Bear?

Love the grainy black and white cinematography and the cheesey music and goofy dancing of the era.  Sal Mineo has never been sexier or sadly creepier.  Always trying to push the envelope, seeing that that sexual revolution was about to explode,  he was always good in anything he did from the time he was about thirteen.

Startling?  And effective.  This Region 0 Great Britain DVD presents the first time this movie has been issued (from Network) in a mainstream version but also the first time it was presented to Britain due to censorship there in the sixties when the film was initially released by a new little studio, Magna in 1965.  I thought it my duty to check this out.  A lot of the companies that featured this film in their catalog have been vying for the inclusion from what must have been an edited for television version that cropped up and did not include the now infamous ""pool scene.""  Research shows the Network version was released in January 2009 and after that versions with the pool scene became readily available and, it was a close call, but this DVD too features the body-building/pool scene that fans today want to see of Sal Mineo who like everyone in the cast (Juliet Prowse, Elaine Stritch, Jan Murray) went into an entertaining foray into the underbelly that Sal was working his way back from/into a comeback before his virtually senseless murder.  This film has everything to survive in cult status, and now what might be furthermore impossible, is the task to produce a restored version.  The writing and direction would today lead places, but this film was ahead of its time.  Of several clips posted on youtube, this has everything except the images are not quite as clear in the title sequence of Lawrence and Nora together in his dreams that I believe it should have, but the entirety of the credits themselves are there which is a vast improvement over some versions that have been issued.  The film was still ""ahead of its time"" in 1996 when it was first re-issued on the big screen in cities like San Francisco.  That Sal, found unquestionably to be gay during the events surrounding his murder investigation, could have put gay icons on the map while he was alive but fate seems to have him and the film remain in the troubled zone of James Dean and other rebels, on the verge of something new and exciting, but yet amiss.",4,At Long Last,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,2157,"['have', 'high', 'regard', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'five-star', 'rating', 'take', 'off', 'point', 'effort', 'Startling', 'effective', 'Region', '0', 'Great', 'Britain', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'movie', 'been', 'issued', 'Network', 'mainstream', 'version', 'also', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'presented', 'Britain', 'due', 'censorship', 'sixties', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'initially', 'released', 'new', 'little', 'studio', 'Magna', '1965', 'thought', 'duty', 'check', 'out', 'lot', 'companies', 'featured', 'film', 'catalog', 'have', 'been', 'vying', 'inclusion', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'television', 'version', 'cropped', 'up', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'now', 'infamous', 'pool', 'scene', 'Research', 'Network', 'version', 'was', 'released', 'January', '2009', 'versions', 'pool', 'scene', 'became', 'readily', 'available', 'was', 'close', 'call', 'DVD', 'too', 'body-building/pool', 'scene', 'fans', 'today', 'want', 'see', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'who', 'everyone', 'cast', 'Juliet', 'Prowse', 'Elaine', 'Stritch', 'Jan', 'Murray', 'went', 'entertaining', 'foray', 'underbelly', 'Sal', 'was', 'working', 'way', 'back', 'comeback', 'virtually', 'senseless', 'murder', 'film', 'everything', 'survive', 'cult', 'status', 'now', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'furthermore', 'impossible', 'task', 'produce', 'restored', 'version', 'writing', 'direction', 'would', 'today', 'lead', 'places', 'film', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'several', 'clips', 'posted', 'youtube', 'everything', 'images', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'clear', 'title', 'sequence', 'Lawrence', 'Nora', 'together', 'dreams', 'believe', 'should', 'have', 'entirety', 'credits', 'are', 'there', 'vast', 'improvement', 'versions', 'have', 'been', 'issued', 'film', 'was', 'still', 'ahead', 'time', '1996', 'when', 'was', 'first', 're-issued', 'big', 'screen', 'cities', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Sal', 'found', 'unquestionably', 'be', 'gay', 'events', 'surrounding', 'murder', 'investigation', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'gay', 'icons', 'map', 'was', 'alive', 'fate', 'have', 'film', 'remain', 'troubled', 'zone', 'James', 'Dean', 'other', 'rebels', 'verge', 'something', 'new', 'exciting', 'yet', 'amiss']",Who Killed Teddy Bear?
