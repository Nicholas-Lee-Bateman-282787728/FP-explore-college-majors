They pretty much condensed the years of Elizabeth's life from 1554 to 1565 into two and half hours of film.

460975,AK0CENM3LUM28,6305358567,Amazon Customer,"[3, 3]","Elizabeth / B000RF7XYOI love Tudor history, but I'm realistic enough to expect a Tudor movie to not be very historically accurate, so I went into Elizabeth with a pretty open mind, knowing that ""history"" and ""entertainment"" rarely meet in Hollywood. I'd have to say that ""Elizabeth"" does a fair job, but the movie definitely has its faults.Blanchett performs wonderfully as Elizabeth and seems made for the role. I would have preferred that Elizabeth be portrayed as more composed and less nervous, which would be both historically accurate and equally entertaining to me, but I suppose that the filmmakers wanted Blanchett's nervous performance to reflect Elizabeth's inner turmoil. I'm sure it is very difficult to play a calm persona whilst conveying inner uncertainty.Similar complaints abound for Elizabeth's indiscretion in scenes where she openly sleeps with Dudley while her ladies-in-waiting watch nearby - I would venture to guess that the whole scene is supposed to be Hollywood-shorthand for their unrequited love, but the ridiculousness of the scene is a little jarring, and I cannot understand why the directors didn't at least introduce a little more secrecy to the scene.The scenes where Elizabeth comes into her own with gentle barbs and quiet cajoling of her parliament are beautifully handled and are wonderful to behold. Blanchett manages to convey just the right amount of humility and control, humor and iron will to make the scene convincing. Elizabeth's concerns about marriage are conveyed clearly and distinctly, as she frets over the inevitability of losing her power, should she wed. And the scenes where Elizabeth struggles with the realities of power, with the necessities of ruthlessness and aloofness, are perfectly conveyed.I do wish, however, that the movie had employed a little more cunning and subtlety on Elizabeth's part. Historically, she managed to play several suitors on a string while she quietly built her country's defenses and earned her right to independence, yet this subtlety is not conveyed here. Regularly and loudly, she protests that she will never marry, and we see almost nothing of the Spanish suitor whose armada would fare so badly and so infamously against Elizabeth's navy. I was disappointed that none of this came across.Overall, this is a decent movie, entertaining enough and with enough kind-of-historical merit to be pleasant to Tudor lovers. I probably wouldn't watch this movie again, though, outside of a one time rental.Oddly, the movie information on the Amazon page lists that English subtitles are included, but the version I received from Blockbuster Online did *not* have English captions for the hard of hearing, only French and Spanish subtitles, so caveat emptor.~ Ana Mardoll",3,"Some Good, Some Bad",1237852800,"03 24, 2009",2009,2755,"['Elizabeth', '/', 'B000RF7XYOI', 'love', 'Tudor', 'history', ""'m"", 'realistic', 'enough', 'expect', 'Tudor', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'historically', 'accurate', 'went', 'Elizabeth', 'pretty', 'open', 'mind', 'knowing', 'history', 'entertainment', 'rarely', 'meet', 'Hollywood', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'Elizabeth', 'fair', 'job', 'movie', 'definitely', 'faults.Blanchett', 'performs', 'wonderfully', 'Elizabeth', 'made', 'role', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'Elizabeth', 'be', 'portrayed', 'more', 'composed', 'less', 'nervous', 'would', 'be', 'historically', 'accurate', 'equally', 'entertaining', 'suppose', 'filmmakers', 'wanted', 'Blanchett', 'nervous', 'performance', 'reflect', 'Elizabeth', 'inner', 'turmoil', ""'m"", 'sure', 'very', 'difficult', 'play', 'calm', 'persona', 'whilst', 'conveying', 'inner', 'uncertainty.Similar', 'complaints', 'abound', 'Elizabeth', 'indiscretion', 'scenes', 'where', 'openly', 'Dudley', 'ladies-in-waiting', 'watch', 'would', 'venture', 'guess', 'whole', 'scene', 'supposed', 'be', 'Hollywood-shorthand', 'unrequited', 'love', 'ridiculousness', 'scene', 'little', 'jarring', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'directors', 'did', ""n't"", 'least', 'introduce', 'little', 'more', 'secrecy', 'scene.The', 'scenes', 'where', 'Elizabeth', 'own', 'gentle', 'barbs', 'quiet', 'cajoling', 'parliament', 'are', 'beautifully', 'handled', 'are', 'wonderful', 'behold', 'Blanchett', 'convey', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'humility', 'control', 'humor', 'iron', 'will', 'make', 'scene', 'convincing', 'Elizabeth', 'concerns', 'marriage', 'are', 'conveyed', 'clearly', 'distinctly', 'inevitability', 'losing', 'power', 'should', 'wed.', 'scenes', 'where', 'Elizabeth', 'realities', 'power', 'necessities', 'ruthlessness', 'aloofness', 'are', 'perfectly', 'conveyed.I', 'do', 'wish', 'however', 'movie', 'had', 'employed', 'little', 'more', 'cunning', 'subtlety', 'Elizabeth', 'part', 'Historically', 'managed', 'play', 'several', 'suitors', 'string', 'quietly', 'built', 'country', 'defenses', 'earned', 'right', 'independence', 'yet', 'subtlety', 'not', 'conveyed', 'here', 'Regularly', 'loudly', 'will', 'never', 'marry', 'see', 'almost', 'nothing', 'Spanish', 'suitor', 'armada', 'would', 'fare', 'so', 'badly', 'so', 'infamously', 'Elizabeth', 'navy', 'was', 'disappointed', 'none', 'came', 'across.Overall', 'decent', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'enough', 'kind-of-historical', 'merit', 'be', 'pleasant', 'Tudor', 'lovers', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'one', 'time', 'rental.Oddly', 'movie', 'information', 'Amazon', 'page', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'included', 'version', 'received', 'Blockbuster', 'Online', 'did', '*not*', 'have', 'English', 'captions', 'hard', 'hearing', 'only', 'French', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'so', 'caveat', 'emptor.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",N/A

This movie captures the story of a single time in the queens life, when she is crowned and is pushed to quickly find herself a King to share her thrown.Much of the film's beginning is dark and filled with quiet whispering. Rooms barely lit with candle light and often the scenes are so soft spoken one has to strain to hear what's being said. After Elizabeth is crowned Queen, the setting seems to brighten and whispers give way to normal dialogue.Right from the start the movie is intense and filled with action. The time period has the Catholics and the Protestants waging wars of the church against each other. There is blood, violence, sexual situations and brief nudity, so obviously this is not a film for children to learn their history from.In trying to capture a very intense love story from English history, this movie is extremely well done. I did however enjoy the more lengthy and historiacally accurate film seriesElizabeth Rjust a bit more. The series, made many years ago is not of the same blockbuster quality sets and filming as this version, but it's still outstanding just the same.

She embodied the young Elizabeth suddenly thrown into a whirlwind of controversy that even an elder would find daunting.  Her power and vulnerability were well illustrated.  You could see her confidence grow with every step and you could see her dilemmas.What I found odd about the movie was that she seemed surprised about the fact the man she was having a relationship with, was married.  Given her position and the prior portion of the relationship, I would think that would not be unknown. Especially, when her relationship continued for a while after she gained the throne.  This may have been a clumsy &quot;movie&quot; introduction and not based in fact however.  It just did not seem to make sense.Additionally, I found the intrigue with the Spanish ambassador very hard to follow.  I never did figure out, what went on there.  Also the handling of the French prince was a joke.  It was so one sided. With so many other portrayals as 3 dimensional this character was rather clumsily handled.

There's an especially disgusting depiction of a clandestine Catholic priest beating a Protestant nobleman to death, and many more false ahistorical distortions await unsuspecting Catholic viewers of this film.Allow me to bring these unfortunate viewers back from this imaginary world and into reality once again. In Elizabethan England, Catholics were so feared that they were subjected to the cruelest executions imaginable. Catholics were hung, disemboweled, and castrated (all in the same execution) while they were still alive. Then they were made to watch as their bowels and innards were burned before their eyes, all at Queen Elizabeth's ordering. Even the Nazis and the Tojos (Japanese Imperials) seldom tortured their victims in so horrible a manner (God rest their souls). In Elizabethan England, this was standard fare.Similarly Ireland and the Catholic Church therein were utterly raped as Protestant Elizabethan purges attempted to eliminate the predominating Catholic gentry, as well as Catholic clergy. There are hundreds of English and Irish Catholic martyrs from this period of history.The atrocities committed by Mary Tudor paled in comparison. It's one thing to tell an honest, impartial story about a controversial historical figure, such as Queen Elizabeth, but it's quite another to lionize this figure, gloss over the atrocities she committed, and portray the innocent victims (eg Catholic priests) of her persecutions as the original aggressors (isn't that how the Axis regimes protrayed their victims?). That alone makes this film propaganda. It's like making a film extolling the scientific achievements of Hitler and the Third Reich and not mentioning the Holocaust.Contrast the reign of Elizabeth with her father, King Henry VIII. Elizabeth and Henry were the early-modern forebears of twentieth century dictators like Hitler. They were both paranoid tyrants who tortured and persecuted religious minorities such as Catholics (St. Thomas More is a very famous Catholic martyr of Henry VIII, and ironically, a member of his court), as well as their political opponents, and yet I've NEVER seen a single positive film portrayal of Henry VIII. What's worse however, is that our modern disgust with Henry VIII is usually generated by little more than a visceral, modern (though completely justified) distaste with violence committed against women, that is, his execution of his wives. As far as Henry's other crimes, we're all historically ignorant and it seems we couldn't care less. Elizabeth carried her father's torch, and continued his bloody work, to an even greater degree.Elizabeth presided over England at an historic time, there's no doubt about it, but, in view of the atrocities she committed, she can never be accorded this level of honor and praise for the same reason other tyrants like Ivan the Terrible and Vlad the Impaler (or in the modern era, Hitler or Stalin) still merit our disgust despite their status as world-changing historical figures. The fact that 2 movies have been made unabshedly celebrating the historic achievements of this woman (ELIZABETH), without showing her darker, more bloodthirsty side, is beyond me.",1,Elizabeth: Anti-Catholic (the ruler AND the film),1334102400,"04 11, 2012",2012,3345,"['Anti-Catholicism', 'last', 'acceptable', 'prejudice', 'especially', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'as', 'long', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'influential', 'force', 'world', 'especially', 'disgusting', 'depiction', 'clandestine', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'beating', 'Protestant', 'nobleman', 'death', 'many', 'more', 'false', 'ahistorical', 'distortions', 'await', 'unsuspecting', 'Catholic', 'viewers', 'film.Allow', 'bring', 'unfortunate', 'viewers', 'back', 'imaginary', 'world', 'reality', 'once', 'again', 'Elizabethan', 'England', 'Catholics', 'were', 'so', 'feared', 'were', 'subjected', 'cruelest', 'executions', 'imaginable', 'Catholics', 'were', 'hung', 'disemboweled', 'castrated', 'same', 'execution', 'were', 'still', 'alive', 'Then', 'were', 'made', 'watch', 'bowels', 'innards', 'were', 'burned', 'eyes', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'ordering', 'Even', 'Nazis', 'Tojos', 'Japanese', 'Imperials', 'seldom', 'tortured', 'victims', 'so', 'horrible', 'manner', 'God', 'rest', 'souls', 'Elizabethan', 'England', 'was', 'standard', 'fare.Similarly', 'Ireland', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'therein', 'were', 'utterly', 'raped', 'Protestant', 'Elizabethan', 'attempted', 'eliminate', 'predominating', 'Catholic', 'gentry', 'as', 'well', 'Catholic', 'clergy', 'are', 'hundreds', 'English', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'martyrs', 'period', 'history.The', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'Mary', 'Tudor', 'paled', 'comparison', 'one', 'thing', 'tell', 'honest', 'impartial', 'story', 'controversial', 'historical', 'figure', 'such', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'quite', 'lionize', 'figure', 'gloss', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'innocent', 'victims', 'eg', 'Catholic', 'priests', 'persecutions', 'original', 'aggressors', ""n't"", 'how', 'Axis', 'regimes', 'protrayed', 'victims', 'alone', 'film', 'propaganda', 'making', 'film', 'extolling', 'scientific', 'achievements', 'Hitler', 'Third', 'Reich', 'not', 'mentioning', 'Holocaust.Contrast', 'reign', 'Elizabeth', 'father', 'King', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'Elizabeth', 'Henry', 'were', 'early-modern', 'forebears', 'twentieth', 'century', 'dictators', 'Hitler', 'were', 'paranoid', 'tyrants', 'who', 'tortured', 'persecuted', 'religious', 'minorities', 'such', 'Catholics', 'St.', 'Thomas', 'More', 'very', 'famous', 'Catholic', 'martyr', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'ironically', 'member', 'court', 'as', 'well', 'political', 'opponents', 'yet', ""'ve"", 'NEVER', 'seen', 'single', 'positive', 'film', 'portrayal', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'What', 'worse', 'however', 'modern', 'disgust', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'usually', 'generated', 'little', 'more', 'visceral', 'modern', 'completely', 'justified', 'distaste', 'violence', 'committed', 'women', 'execution', 'wives', 'As', 'far', 'Henry', 'other', 'crimes', ""'re"", 'historically', 'ignorant', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'Elizabeth', 'carried', 'father', 'torch', 'continued', 'bloody', 'work', 'even', 'greater', 'degree.Elizabeth', 'presided', 'England', 'historic', 'time', 'doubt', 'view', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'accorded', 'level', 'honor', 'praise', 'same', 'reason', 'other', 'tyrants', 'Ivan', 'Terrible', 'Vlad', 'Impaler', 'modern', 'era', 'Hitler', 'Stalin', 'still', 'merit', 'disgust', 'status', 'world-changing', 'historical', 'figures', 'fact', '2', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'unabshedly', 'celebrating', 'historic', 'achievements', 'woman', 'ELIZABETH', 'showing', 'darker', 'more', 'bloodthirsty', 'side']",N/A

Henry VIII has snuffed it from gout or syphilis, it depends on who you read, Bloody Mary's got a tumour and the Catholics' greatest fear is Anne Boleyn's daughter Elizabeth.  The opening scene signals the film's intent. Protestant heretics are burnt mercilessly at the grisly stake, accompanied by proclamations that they should burn in Hell. It's clear that England is in a pretty gloomy state and ruled by a humourless zealot, Mary who is hell-bent on converting or murdering Elizabeth.One need not possess any knowledge of history to make sense of the plot and story. Like a good mystery there were subtle nuances. Glances between characters that foreshadowed events and interactions to come, such as the woman that betrays Norfolk, and the child that inadvertently reveals his father's hiding place.There are many things that make Elizabeth a great film. For example, not only is it amazingly realistic, but it also portrays a very accurate depiction of the Queen. The difficult early part of her reign is not as well known as the stunning success that she later achieved as a leader, and her potent and strong-willed personality is captured very well in this film. She suffers through countless hardships during this part of her life, and the circumstances leading to her crowning of herself as The Virgin Queen are what make up the story of this excellent film.

I suppose that's the nature of royal courts, at least back when they held real power.Elizabeth held real power, and therefore was threatened on all sides. Cate Blanchett plays a very convincing Elizabeth, from the time when she was a princess in seclusion in the country and her crazy sister Mary sent for her to try to persuade her to keep England Catholic, and lock her in the Tower of London on general paranoia. She was clearly in love with Lord Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes), at least until she was told he was already married.Advisers wanted her to marry the king of either Spain or France, arguing that her throne would not be safe until she had married and produced an heir. Oddly enough, they only mentioned Catholic kings. But Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush) advises her to take care, and not get involved with either France or Spain. France was allied with Scotland and Mary, Queen of Scots, was trying to claim England for Catholicism. Spain had some plots of its own.Then word gets to the Queen that the Duke of Norfolk is plotting an alliance with Mary to raise a claim to the English throne, and Elizabeth realizes she has no choice but to deal harshly and summarily with the Catholic plotters. She then talks it over with Walsingham and realizes she must be the Virgin Queen for England, to replace their devotion to the Virgin Mary with devotion to herself.That's the rough outline of the story, but the story is in the details, some gruesome, some passionate, and all filled with spectacular costumes and sets.

She is, indeed, just a shell, and Cate Blanchett brings the Queen to life;  she takes us from the early days of the vibrant and delicate velvet glove  to the often ruthless ironfist, delivering what I feel as the best  performance for an actress in a leading role for 1998.

This is a historical film that does take some artistic liberties. King Henry VIII has recently died, and his evil daughter 'Bloody Mary' is on the throne. King Henry VIII had some issues and faults. But despite that, he was actually a really great king. (He built up the navy well, authorized the Bible's translation into English, freed England from Rome's corruption, kept the control his father Henry VII had established after the War of the Roses, and even held England together during the uncertainties of the Reformation.Mary I seems to have inherited her father's issues without any of his redeeming qualities. She seems to be desperate to hang onto a crown and control that she will inevitably lose. (She even considers killing her own sister Elizabeth.)Elizabeth seems to be a sympathetic character throughout most of this film. First she is virtually Mary's prisoner. When Mary dies, Elizabeth of course becomes queen. But she is already being manipulated by certain parties that seek to dethrone her. (Even to the point of giving her advice that will damage England.) She has enemies both foreign and domestic. We also see that the Bishops are against her.Add to that that she gradually finds out that while she loves Robert Dudley, he is in fact a married man. (Needless to say, she doesn't take to this well.)Cate Blanchett really embodies the daughter of King Henry VIII. In her trials, she is cautious. Sometimes she shows an untapped power. Yet she can also be sympathetic and vulnerable.At times, Geoffrey Rush steals the film as Elizabeth's advisor and protector. (Kind of a medieval FBI agent.) He is very loyal and very good at his job. At times he does seem almost evil. But we could easily argue that he needs to 'fight fire with fire' as he takes on the many enemies of Elizabeth. Geoffrey Rush will probably always be remembered by most as Captaim Hector Barbossa. But in my opinion, Walsingham is really his best performance.Elizabeth has many political enemies. But perhaps the most disturbing thing about this film is all the people who want to kill Elizabeth in the name of God. (Including the Pope. Performed by the 96 year old legendary John Gielgud.)Geoffrey Rush comes through and flips the tables. But to the director's credit, we are somewhat disturbed as Geoffrey Rush takes down Elizabeth's opposition. (Violence is disturbing even if the good side is winning.)Perhaps the most satisfying part is that at the start of the film, Geoffrey Rush survives and flips the tables on an assassination attempt. He knows who did it, and even has fun by greeting the man behind the failed attempt in a friendly civil manner.

Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth the first gave the best female performance of the 1990's and one of the best of all time. Every scene with her is worth mentioning. The Parliament scene. The scene where she gets the Mary I (Kathy Burke) ring. Her practicing her parliament speech scene. The scenes she has with Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush). Her &quot;I am my father's daughter speech.&quot; The scene at the end where she walks to her throne-riveting. She gives an amazingly nuanced and remarkable performance that can not be over-praised. The fact that she lost best Actress is one of the biggest robberies in Oscar history.  Fanny Ardant gives an amazingly real performance as Mary Of Guise. An astonishing example of a small role that is made big by a remarkable performance- 100% Oscar worhty. Kathy Burke is great as Mary I (&quot;Bloody Mary.&quot;)Her plea to Elizabeth to uphold Catholicism in England was Oscar Worthy. Geoffrey Rush is ruthless and conniving as Walsingham. His scene where he describes to Elizabeth how she should be seen as a ruler made him deserve the Oscar for best Supporting actor of 1998. Also worth mentioning are Richard Attenborough and Christpher Eccleston.  The direction job by Shekhar Kapur is one of the best of the 1990's and ever. The angles, the close-ups, brilliant. The editing by Jill Bilcock is remarkably done and adds tremendously to the story. The script by Michael Hirst has some of the best lines ever written-an amazing job. The costumes, cinematography, score and sets are by far some of the best of the 1990's and of all time. Especially the costumes and the cinematography.

461006,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,6305358567,Classic film buff,"[0, 0]","I'll try to make this as succinct as possible, this is a film you will want to watch for the quality of the performances, the camerawork, the elaborate costumes and settings, and the intriguing, overstuffed story.  However, if you were a student using this film as a study aid for a test on the initial reign of Elizabeth I, you'd flunk for sure!  The truth is stretched so far that if it were a spring it would break and snap back with a loud BOING!  What a pity, since the Tudor dynasty is strong enough to stand on the actual facts to spin an enthralling tale dramatically without all the phony embellishments.The story begins in the last years of the reign of the pathetic Queen Mary Tudor (Kathy Burke) of England who is slowly dying of a tumor.  Obsessed with her Roman Catholic religion, abandoned by her husband King Phillip of Spain, ill advised by the powerful Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston), and other nobility and clergy she is near breakdown both physically and mentally.  She allows herself to be persuaded that her younger half sister the Princess Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett), heir to her crown, yet a Protestant is a possible traitor.  Mary has Elizabeth transported and confined to the Tower of London.  Although Mary has little love for Elizabeth, she cannot believe her guilty of treason and refuses to have her executed or disinherited.  Elizabeth is eventually released to Hatfield one of her country estates where she lives quietly until Mary dies and she assumes the throne.  However, her triumph is short lived as the fledgling queen is beset by serious problems, the treasury is empty, England threatened with an unfriendly neighbor, Scotland, the religious question divides the country, and she is pressured to marry and produce an heir.  In addition she has to juggle an importunate lover Sir Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes),  a secretary of state who seeks to govern her, Sir William Cecil (Sir Richard Attenborough),  her enigmatic director of security Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), and the treacherous Duke of Norfolk who continues to be a malign presence.Front and center in this heady swirl of pageantry, sex, intrigue and melodrama is the star making performance of Cate Blanchett as the young Elizabeth.  I'd never seen Ms. Blanchett before this film, and I was astounded at just how accomplished she was in developing her portrayal.  Elizabeth Tudor was one of the most complex, brilliant women in history, a true Renaissance ""Prince"" in the Machiavellian sense.  She was capricious, a mass of contradictions, formidably intelligent yet neurotic, cool headed but possessed of a fiery temper, charismatic yet kept most people at arms length.  In turn she could be lion hearted, petty, shrewd, vain, generous, coquettish, diplomatic, bull headed, charming, devious and ruthless.  Ms. Blanchett is able to evoke most of these characteristics as she undergoes Elizabeth's journey from the vulnerable, imperiled princess at the beginning to the iconic, majestic Gloriana at the end, without ever losing the audience's interest or sympathy.  One of my favorite scenes is when Elizabeth is preparing to address a session of Parliament on the topic of religious conformity.  She makes the queen endearingly human as she nervously rehearses her speech aloud by herself, forgetting pieces, making corrections, getting frustrated and angry the same as any college student preparing for their first lengthy speech in Effective Presentation 101.  In terms of her appearance in the coronation scene at Westminster Abbey, clad in an ermine mantle over cloth of gold, jeweled gold crown perched atop her loose, flowing strawberry blonde hair Ms. Blanchett uncannily mirrors a famous portrait of Elizabeth in her coronation regalia. Her compelling, muti faceted portrayal heralded the arrival of an exciting, young actress brimming over with talent.  Deservedly her achievement was rewarded with a Best Actress Oscar nomination and wins for both the Golden Globe and the British Film Academy Awards for Best Actress.Just as a fine diamond will sparkle more dazzlingly in the proper setting, an impressive supporting cast adds to the luster of Ms. Blanchett's portrait.  Heading this list is another newcomer, Joseph Fiennes, who as Elizabeth's great passion Sir Robert Dudley, greatly resembles a younger version of an actual portrait of Dudley with his brooding, gypsy like looks, and acts with a feverish recklessness.  Geoffrey Rush brings a cold blooded pragmatism to Sir Francis Walsingham, while Sir Richard Attenborough ably brings out the self-serving interest of Sir William Cecil.  The malevolence of Christopher Eccleston's Norfolk makes him a truly dangerous adversary to Elizabeth.  As the foppish, giddy Duke of Anjou, a would be suitor of Elizabeth, Vincent Cassel brings some moments of comic relief to the heavy drama.  The hysterical Queen Mary of Kathy Burke, a woman haunted by her failures evokes pity.  There is also a glimpse of the future James Bond, as Daniel Craig plays a small but key role as the Jesuit priest Father John Ballard.  Finally, in one of his last roles, theatrical great Sir John Gielgud has a quick cameo as the Pope.The settings and costumes are opulent and magnificent, all the splendors of Elizabeth's court, a Renaissance tapestry brought to life, the musical score is effectively used to underscore the events unfolding on the screen.  All were rewarded with Oscar nomiinations, a total of seven in all including Best Picture.  However the only trophy won was by Jenny Shicore for Best Makeup.Regarding the extras, director Shekhar Kupur does a commentary, an insightful glimpse into the vision of the film, and there are two good featurettes, the better of the two is ""The Making of Elizabeth"", which is more developed, but the second one ""Elizabeth"" is also worth a look.  Also when this DVD was released, the inferior sequel ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" was soon to open, there is a sneak peak at that as well.Though the film will certainly hold the average person's interest, the danger is that the uninformed viewer will take this very loose dramatic interpretation as the actual history of Elizabeth I and her early reign. So, by all means watch this if for no other reason than the glittering performance of Cate Blanchett, without it I would certainly drop the rating at least by one star.  Please remember though to go into this cleared eyed with the definite understanding that this is the writer and director's dramatic interpretation of the Elizabethan Age, and not the way it really was.

""Historical"" however, does not.  I am very surprised at the number of people here who claim to be lovers of British history who praised the film for its accurate depiction of events.  Elizabeth could certainly play the fragile, indecisive maid when she needed to do so, but fragile and uncertain she was not-- she learned hard politics from a real master, her father, Henry VIII.Certainly fond of Lord Dudley, there is no evidence they ever had a sexual relationship.  The sorry truth is, if Good Queen Bess ever had a sexual relationship it was with her abusive guardian, the husband of Queen Catherine (Parr).  Elizabeth and Anjou never met, in England or elsewhere (she did later meet his brother, who came closer than other man to marrying her but of course did not succeed).The clothing and hair styles, while deserving of notice, are largely inaccurate, in some cases, Edwardian more than Elizabethan. This is somewhat surprising given the rich and accurate store of knowledge regarding the couterie of the period.There are numerous other points to make, but simply know this:This is a work of fiction, based on certain historical figures and a few historical events.  Watch the film and appreciate the fine acting, the beautiful settings and costumes, and the intensity and passion of the characters (who really were that proud, that devoted, and that ready to die for their various causes), but do not learn history from it.  Hopefully you'll be intrigued enough to find a few good books to read and learn of it yourself-- you may be surprised that the real stories are even more arresting.History takes place over periods of years, decades, and longer, and even significant events that unfold quickly can be awfully hard to condense into a 2 hour movie, so faulting them for inaccuracies serves little purpose; audiences should however be better trained to recognize fiction and enjoy it but not necessarily learn historical facts from it.  Rather, learn about the human condition from fiction, which is the greatest purpose it serves.",3,Cate? S&igrave;! History?

Thanks to this film, Elizabeth is revealed to me in a whole different way. She's a girl with a broken heart, a survival, a murceful queen, honest and devoted to England! I was quiet amazed by  Cate Blanchett's performance. In every movement she made, in every word she spoke, she was as believable as could possibly ever be. The story of Elizabeth's life and her battle against evil within her country as well as from out of borders of England lays out so beautifully by Cate's performance as well as the writers and directors that it was hard to take eyes off of the screen. A history, a legend, and a mystery of the queen Elezabeth won over my heart as I watched the movie.

461020,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6305358567,Dennis Littrell,"[1, 2]","Elizabeth is deeper than might be thought on first blush, and it reverberates, but not with any simplistic answers to the human struggle,  but with uncomfortable questions, disturbing allegations.Allegation  number one: a woman can rule and be the equal of a man, but she must  suppress her feminine instincts.Uncomfortable question number one: are  women as vicious and murderous as our ""demonic males""?What makes  Elizabeth such a wonderful movie is the uncompromising portrait it presents  of a woman in a life or death struggle while in a position of enormous  power.  Notice that she does NOT become a man, nor take on bogus or pseudo  masculine traits to achieve her ends.  She remains a woman to the core, yet  acts with the kind of aggressive, decisive, brutal intelligence usually  assigned to men.Next question: Is this good to know?A great work of  art should be content to ask the great questions, not presume to answer  them (but see below).Cate Blanchett is superb in the title role and  wonderfully supported by Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes.  Shekhar Kapur's  direction is without a hint of cant or even the slightest pandering to a  mass audience, and is psychologically true and without any presumption to  moral or spiritual wisdom.  There is no preaching or taking sides.  The  script is a work of scholarship fused with the most compelling dramatic  development, climax and resolution.  The editing is almost invisible yet we  can see that exactly enough was cut away while the essence was preserved;  viz., it is remarkable how we are led to experience the political growth of  the young queen and see her take on the attributes of her father, as  necessary, and then see her seek refuge in the church and a kind of piety  as ""the Virgin Queen"" in such a short period of elapsed screen time.  THAT  is film making of the highest quality.Not enough can be said about the  subtle, charming, expansive, vivid and veracious performance of Blanchett,  yet Joseph Fiennes is to be commended for achieving success in a difficult  and unsympathetic role.  Geoffrey Rush's restraint and control in a part  that could have easily been overplayed was highly admirable and contributed  strongly to the success of the film.This is not to say that the film is  without flaws.  The scene where Elizabeth discovers the French duke's  homosexuality is unlikely as staged, and her risque behavior with Leicester  not in character.  Better, I think, would have been to keep him frustrated  and allow him only to play at love; however, today's audiences seem to  demand coitus always.  Leicester's dalliance with one of her ladies was  extremely stupid, but in character.  The co-incidence of her wearing the  acid dress as she betrayed her queen was a delicious if implausible irony.  Further it was not made clear how the queen's commands through Walsingham  are made viable so that they must be carried out; indeed the under struggle  among the ministers was glossed over, although her dismissal of the no  longer effective Sir William Cecil was aptly done.(Of course I can  presume to answer my queries.)  I think allegation number one, that a woman  as a ruler must abandon her normal sexual drive is true, but the argument  is too long for this space.  Are women as vicious as men?  They don't take  the foolish chances that men take, since they can be reproductively  rewarded only by staying alive and securing a stable future, whereas men  can reproduce prodigiously for a while and then die successfully.  But when  necessary, women can be as brutal as Genghis Khan, as Elizabeth  demonstrates.Is it good to know that women are also vicious animals,  when all the time we would prefer to think of them as fairy tale  princesses?  Well, something's lost and something's gained in growing up;  but, yes, it's important to always keep that in mind when out there in the  big world.  I might add that it is sobering to realize that women as  reproductive animals was not even addressed in this film.

However  embellished, the story line is compelling, the action thrilling, and the  scenery -- English.  The cinematography is lucious. The cast is superb.The thing I find unforgiveable about this film is the rewriting of role  of the Earl of Leicester (Fiennes).  Leicester was Elizabeth's close  friend, and maybe even her lover. Their relationship did not end until he  died. He was her most loyal subject. The truth is more compelling than the  fiction in his case.Elizabeth relied on Leicester all of his life. She  made him 'Master of the Horse' and he was her closest confidente.  Many  believe his early death was partly owing to her overworking her good  friend.  He never betrayed her, he only wanted to marry her. But Elizabeth  did not trust marriage, and why should she. Her own mother (Anne) and her  cousin (Catherine Howard), were both executed by a jealous husband  --Elizabeth's father, Henry the VIII.Much of the story line in this  film is drawn from real events surrounding Elizabeth's accendancy to the  throne.  As a protestant in a catholic world, Elizabeth had many enemies.  Some of the extreme dangers she faced are chillingly shown in this film,  although I do believe Mary of Guise, so wonderfully played by the French  actress Fanny Ardant lived a bit before Elizbeth's time.Cate Blanchett  deserved every accolade she received for her portrayal of the young  Elizabeth. As nearly as I can tell from the historical material I have  read, Elizabeth was a great deal like Blanchett's screen portrayal.Elizabeth became the &quot;Virgin Queen&quot; to her subjects, not so  much because of her celibacy (which may or may not have been a fiction) but  because her people were &quot;Mary Worshippers&quot; and needed a diversion  away from their affinity for the Blessed Virgin Mary of the Roman Catholic  church (who some historians believe was used to divert &quot;pagans&quot;  from The Goddess of the Celtic religion.)The most visually stunning  scenes in the film take place near the end when Elizabeth dons the white  face paint and jewels seen in the Armada portrait.

Film is a medium that works via visuals, and Kapur delivers sensational vistas, landscapes, settings, and angles.  There's a look and a feel of quality aesthetics in this film, which makes watching it a visually-enhancing experience.As Kapur in the special features readily admits, this is a speculative account of the early reign of Queen Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett).  Her ascension certainly came at a most turbulent time; she succeeded her very Catholic sister, ""Bloody Mary,"" whose persecution of Protestant ""heretics"" was tearing Britain apart.  (In fact, the film opens with a disturbing scene depicting three ""heretics"" being burned alive at the stake; quite the ""hook"" to get the viewer to pay attention.)  The young queen is in dangerous waters, and turns to two men for help.  One of them, Sir William Cecil (played solidly by Sir Richard Attenborough), has consistent advice:  Get married, produce an heir.  The other advisor, Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush is sensational in this brooding, almost sinister role) is a bit more practical:  Do whatever it takes to keep Elizabeth in power.To top it all off, there is the matter of Elizabeth's lover (although not proven historical fact), Robert Dudley.  Played by an almost-dainty Joseph Fiennes, it becomes readily apparent young Robert will not be strong enough to handle a queen growing steadily more powerful and independent.  Dudley's outcome is one of the more predictable plot lines of the film.And as we watch, we see the young Elizabeth become hardened, more cynical; we see her forfeit her own personal life in exchange for a persona--an icon around whom her people can rally.  All of this is done through the exquisite professionalism of Cate Blanchett, who much deserved her Academy Award nomination.Other surprises in this film include a stunning Fanny Ardant, who plays Elizabeth's rival, Mary of Guise; and then there's the new James Bond, Daniel Craig, who plays a somewhat overzealous priest.  The special features pale in comparison to the movie, but come on, the movie is where the rubber meets the road.  ELIZABETH is a gripping, compelling, artistic period piece--a cinematic feast as rich as it is engrossing.  Sign me up as a Shekhar Kapur fan.--D.

461027,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,6305358567,D. Mok,"[27, 38]","Your verdict of this movie will depend on what you think of the Wong Kar-wai school of filmmaking:  Director first, editor second, actors being the last consideration.Personally, I can't stand this style of  filmmaking.  Taking only the most superficial of nouvelle vague stylings  (jump-cuts, strange angles, stylized lighting) but applying the techniques  to the most inappropriate material, this &quot;New New Wave&quot; tends to  sacrifice the performers and all human qualities for a beautiful-looking,  but dramatically inept piece.Elizabeth is such a piece.  Given an  actress as strong as Cate Blanchett, just why director Shekhar Kapur  insists on suffocating her performance with endless arrays of camera  trickery is baffling to me.  In this film Kapur shows off a real knack for  missing the dramatic moment.  In almost any given scene, you never see the  decisive moment for a character, and least of all Elizabeth.  Blanchett's  charm and elegance were a joy to behold, and Geoffrey Rush brilliantly  injects a tinge of villainy in his ally role, creating a most interesting  supporting character.  But chances are when you want to see the actors,  Kapur would've either cut to some overblown, poorly performed crowd shot,  or an overhead where you can't see a tinge of emotion, or cut maniacally to  ensure you don't really see the actors.  Some cinephiles may consider this  brilliant New Wave filmmaking; I consider it hogwash, the director  selfishly putting himself on display while sacrificing all of the  characters and story elements.Cases in point:  We never see Elizabeth  succumb to her council and send troops to Scotland, so her later remorse  (&quot;My father would never have made such a mistake&quot;) is completely  unfounded; her giving up Lord Robert (a watery Joseph Fiennes) is done in  yet another hacked up dance sequence (one of about half a dozen, all  boringly choreographed and poorly edited, going for dazzle instead of  momentum) so her internal change doesn't register at all; Walsingham  (Rush)'s seduction of Marie de Guise (Fanny Ardant, a good performer, also  strangled by Kapur's direction) is ellipsed so when you see her dead, you  know what happened, but there's no impact or feeling of triumph.The  script is hackneyed, with poor dialoguing and lots of unbelievably puerile  jokes (especially when the French suitor comes to visit).  All this serves  to weaken Elizabeth's character even further, and reduces the narrative  drive of this film to zilch.  There's no build to the plots against  Elizabeth's life and even less suspense.The greatest problem remains the  direction and its disdain for all things human.  In all honesty, I've never  seen such a great lead performance (Blanchett's) so thoroughly sabotaged by  a director.  For that, I hold Elizabeth in contempt.

For example, the camera often spins around Cate Blanchett/Elizabeth to indicate the many conspiracies that threatened Elizabeth.In addition, the commentary discusses moral, philosophical and historical issues, not just technical details.  For example, it discusses Elizabeth's reception of Mary's ring under a large tree, and explains that this scene was filmed from afar, since it is recorded history and putting us far away makes it feel as if we are viewing history from the present (from afar).  But when the emotional character of Elizabeth becomes important, the director moves the camera in closer.  Or that he filmed Norfolk as ""stone,"" tough, hardened and determined, while he filmed Walsingham, Elizabeth's key ally, as ""water,"" fluid, flexible and behind-the-scenes.  Water will wear out the stone in the long run, he says in the commentary.The director also discusses the film's central emphasis on the development of Elizabeth from a young woman into a position of political power.  He states, ""To be a great leader, you have to be totally detached,"" and his film and his commentary amply display Elizabeth's progression from emotional youth to powerful monarch, with all of the benefits and costs to her and those who love her.I found that the viewer can even watch the commentary but still follow the plot (unlike some where all you get are the visuals with the commentary blocking out the story itself); in other words, the commentary is not a second experience that could've been put on a separate disk, but it follows hand-in-hand with the film.  Obviously, you might want to watch the film first without the commentary, but my point is that the commentary enriches, without wiping out, the story with comments of historical and directorial importance and interest.All in all, I found the commentary track to be a great complement to the film, and not the superfluous distraction that commentary tracks often amount to.

A young and naive Elizabeth (superbly played by Cate Blanchett) came to the throne in a time of religious war, national rivalry, and cutthroat politics.  Aided by the sound advice of her advisors and guided by her own intelligence and instincts, she survives a series of threats to her throne and to England to become the legendary Virgin Queen.The story opens as ""Bloody Mary"", Catholic Queen of England and barren wife of King Philip of Spain, lies dying.  The throne passes to her  Protestant half-sister, Elizabeth, who is taken in hand by her courtiers, most notably the experienced Sir William Cecil (played with an attractive mixture of patience and urgency by Richard Attenborough).  Elizabeth is immediately faced with complicated responsibilities as queen, not least of which her need to balance her love for the Earl of Leicester (Joseph Fiennes) against the demand of her advisors that she marry a suitable royal to build alliances for England.Elizabeth quickly learns to make her own decisions in walking a narrow line between contending religious and political factions with the aid of her intelligence master, Sir Francis Walsingham (played with pitch-perfect sinster aspect by Geoffrey Rush).  The supreme challenge to her throne comes from the ambitious and powerful Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston), who makes alliances with both friend and enemy in a plot to overturn Elizabeth. To survive, Elizabeth must demonstrate that she has mastered the lessons of power.This movie is well-casted, superbly staged, reasonably faithful to the historical record, and features Cate Blanchett in her first real starring role.

The production design and costuming, while  interesting and possibly accurate (who really knows) left me not knowing  who was whom and where was where.

Had I an  advanced degree in European history perhaps my reaction would be rabid,  instead of  tepid.A few directions, some simple titles, narration,  or  background exposition, would have helped immensely.

To enlighten him and those who're interested in ""the wisest woman who ever lived"" (William Cecil):1) There WAS a mood of rising protestantism as this movie starts. (1558) Mary HAD been popular after overthrowing the tragic Lady Jane Grey and her greedy father. She had been popular for being King Henry's daughter and for what she had to go through in her father's reign. BUT when she began to burn old men, women and even pregnant women she lost a great deal of sympathy. And when she married England's arch-enemy, Catholic King Philipp of Spain (Her mother's great-nephew) she lost whatever love the English had for this half-Spanish Queen. The fact that she supported her husband in an expensive war against France and that she lost Calais also cost her a great deal and it showed what a bad ruler she was. Heretical rebels? Old priests like gentle Thomas Cranmer and pregnant peasant-women were heretical rebels? However biased can one be!2) Mary DID NOT like to surrender her throne to her mother's rival's daughter. Only when Elizabeth agreed to pay Mary's horrid debts and agreed to to fight Catholicism didn't Mary resign to her fate. (After two phantm-pregnancies)Now for Nr. 3: To say that Elizabeth was impotent as Queen is laughable. I'll refute the ""examples"" one by one.Accusation: A: She had personally given her royal assurance to the Spanish Minister that the Spanish treasure ships bearing the pay for Alva's soldiers in the Netherlands, the ships which had taken refuge from pirates in English harbors, should be released and the money taken under safeguards to its proper destination. Cecil simply overruled her. He ordered the money to be confiscated and his orders were obeyed, not hers.Answer: Ever heard of the word diplomacy? It had been Elizabeth's plan to seize the ships from the beginning. She, being a magnificent liar, sweet-talked the Spanish ambassador while Cecil took the blame. He obeyed his Queen's REAL wishes. And was honoured afterwards. I'm sure Elizabeth had a good laugh at the Spaniards' folly. By seizing these ships Elizabeth not only hurt the Spaniards but won the support and friendship of the Netherlands (Fellow protestants). Later she sent Leicester down there as gouvenor. She won the support of the Netherlands, Scotland, the Hugenotts etc. by this brilliant act of diplomacy. Cecil, being his mistress' ""conscience"" bore the blame gracefully.Accusation2: ""B: She desired to save Norfolk. Three separate times she tried to stop the execution. Cecil overruled and had him put to death.""Not true. Since Norfolk was a relative of the Queen it's natural that having to sign his death-warrant caused her grief. Plus he was a Duke by blood, one of the oldest families in the country. Cecil NEVER overruled Queen Elizabeth, he was wise enough to warn those who wanted to that if they dared to attack her as a sovereign she'd cut them down with no mercy. One whom he advised but who didn't listen was the Earl of Essex. Elizabeth had him put to death for trying to overrule and depose her. If needed, she was as hard as iron.Accusation Nr.3: ""C: She tried to recall Drake and stop England from declaring war on Spain. No one thought to heed her orders.""Another brilliant way of diplomacy that he misunderstood. Elizabeth ""wanted"" to recall Drake when he was ""safely far away enough"" to attack Cadiz ""against the Queen's wishes"". She made a fuss, kept the booty and prevented the Armada from sailing much sooner than it actually did. She knighted Drake for all he did.Accusation Nr. 4 ""D: The supreme example is the murder of Mary, Queen of Scots. We are often led to believe that Elizabeth faked remorse at having her cousin executed. This is totally false. Elizabeth was horrified. She did everything she could to stop Ceil from having Mary beheaded. Again, no one paid attention to England great, powerful, wise Queen Elizabeth, so legendary for her strength of will and character.""Now this is completely off the mark. Mary, Queen of Scots, who had planned to murder her cousin, had her husband murdered (To marry her husband's murderer whose children she would have born out of wedlock otherwise) had been deposed by her outraged people who wanted to have her executed. Mary, after abusing Elizabeth's patience for years, fled to England. The country she wanted to rule herself. As for Elizabeth on Mary's death: The only qualms she had were the facts that it wasn't wise to have another Queen executed and that Mary was her cousin. She had protected Mary for over 17 years from her council and her people. When she signed the warrant it was dispatched and done with. She DID fake remorse AND was horrified at the same time. She dismissed both Walsingham and Cecil after the deed for a long time. Plus the man who delivered the warrant to be dealt with (Davison) was condemned to die which was later turned to life in prison. Cecil DID NOT have Mary put to death. Elizabeth signed the death-warrant. If anyone had a major part in this it was Lord Walsingham. Get your facts straight and don't spread nonsense.Accusation Nr.5: ""Elizabeth secretly held deep sympathy for the Catholic Church. As a young girl, she grew up amidst the cynical, elitist class of intellectuals who doubted Catholicism mainly because they wanted its wealth. Elizabeth was naturally influenced by such propaganda. But in time, she grew to understand just how villainous was the plundering of England's great abbeys and churches so that greedy nobles, disguised as religious reformers, could grow wealthier. It is said that if the King of Spain had launched an attack and seized England, she would have helped him.""This is complete nonsense for several reasons. When it came down to decide which cause she should support it was always Protestantism which she chose. She herself wasn't a Puritan (Like Walsingham was) and didn't burn Catholics but when it came down to punish those Catholics who wanted to murder her (Babington is the most prominent figure) she had no problem to have them tortured and killed as traitors. Nothing of Elizabeth's thoughts on her father's deeds (Plundering the abbeys and churches) was ever recorded, it was, like her thoughts on her mother, a private matter which she never spoke of. (No testimonies survived) So don't ASSUME things, this is not fiction, it's history. And the evidence points against that lame theory. As for THIS: ""It is said that if the King of Spain had launched an attack and seized England, she would have helped him.""Well he DID! Does the ARMADA ring a bell? And Elizabeth didn't help her enemy there, that's for sure. She went to see her troops in person and spoke to them passionately to overthrow the enemy! And BOY, they won magnificently! After that Elizabeth became GLORIANA. So that ""theory"" is certainly false.Now to this movie. It's wrong beyond belief. Elizabeth is portrayed as a weakling who's influenced first by Dudley, then by Walsingham. (Who wasn't her advisor back then) Plus the stories of Marie de Guise being murdered, Marie de Guise sleeping with her nephew, Elizabeth sleeping with Dudley, the Spanish ambassador being murdered etc. are all fiction. I could go on and on about the costumes being all wrong, the locations totally off etc. But it's not necessary. For a real portrait of England's greatest monarch ever watch Elizabeth R. with Glenda Jackson. She makes you believe what Elizabeth said: ""I will have no master but only one mistress here!""",1,Horrible distortion of great history,1110412800,"03 10, 2005",2005,7591,"['reviewer', 'certainly',

461036,A1SW80RQNB3DMK,6305358567,EquesNiger,"[5, 5]","This film quickly became on of my very favorites. It clearly falls within the genre of costume drama, but manages to portray the intrigues of the period in sufficiently byzantine fashion as to keep the viewer riveted and in suspense DESPITE the fact that all of us know Elizabeth ""wins"" in the end.Cate Blanchett is truly one amazing actress, and demonstrates an incredible range of emotion in what must have been a very difficult part to play. She cleverly reflects Elizabeth, threatened by her fanatical and mad sister, Bloody Mary. During this interview with the dying queen, Blanchett reflects terror, integrity and apprehension at the death warrant in her sister's hands, while at the same time showing a calculating ambition and desire for the throne using her eyes alone. During the early days of Elizabeth's reign, we see a queen who is incredibly inexperienced and niaive, but at the same time Blanchett's performance laces that character with steel, such that her emergence in later days as a iron fist does not seem a sudden and unbelievable transition minus the velvet. Her Walsingham, played to perfection by Geoffrey Rush, seems written 1/3 historical character, 1/3 John Dee, and 1/3 Nicolo Machiavelli. This must be the finest performance of Rush's career to date, and there is some contest as to whether he, or Blanchett, truly dominates this film. Fanny Ardant, playing Mary of Guise with vile yet sweet seductiveness as only she can, is another powerful performance, despite her limited time on the screen in the film. Kathy Burke's mad Queen Mary is vilely terrifying in her Catholic devotion and desire to eradicate the protestant threat, and the comedienne shows herself made of greater stuff than past given credit for. There are some disappointing performances. Christopher Eccleston's Duke Norfolk lacks depth, coming over as a smug bully without the mental agility to perform the political feats we see him accomplish in the film. Joseph Fiennes, one of the most overrated of actors, again shows his ability to portray emotion limited exclusively to eyebrows and facial expressions. Im not sure whether the role was written with ""cute, cocky toy-boy"" in mind, but as this is all that J. Fiennes seems capable of, its what you see.What is truly amazing about this film is the fact that, despite an almost total lack of ""action"" until the last few minutes, and the fact that it focuses on plots, counter-plots, intrigues and counter-intrigues, it still more than manages to keep the viewer engrossed and rivetted. Yes, historical events were modified to make the film more engrossing (the ""bloodbath"" at the end actually took decades to complete, and many of those ""removed"" were done so through exile, rather than assassination/execution). However, the film relies substantially on the ability of its performers to carry the effect off, and Rush/Blanchett and others do this with magnificent grace and eloquence. These performances manage to keep you mentally engaged throughout.Bearing in mind that Elizabeth has been synonamous with Glenda Jackson in most minds, it is great to finally have a performance by yet another brilliant actress which not only compares favorably, but perhaps supercedes that of Dame Jackson in the role.",5,"Historically inaccurate, but PHENOMENAL!...",1025308800,"06 29, 2002",2002,3256,"['film', 'quickly', 'became', 'very', 'clearly', 'genre', 'costume', 'drama', 'portray', 'intrigues', 'period', 'sufficiently', 'byzantine', 'fashion', 'keep', 'viewer', 'riveted', 'suspense', 'DESPITE', 'fact', 'know', 'Elizabeth', 'wins', 'end.Cate', 'Blanchett', 'truly', 'one', 'amazing', 'actress', 'incredible', 'range', 'emotion', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'difficult', 'part', 'play', 'cleverly', 'Elizabeth', 'threatened', 'fanatical', 'mad', 'sister', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'interview', 'dying', 'queen', 'Blanchett', 'terror', 'integrity', 'apprehension', 'death', 'warrant', 'sister', 'hands', 'same', 'time', 'showing', 'calculating', 'ambition', 'desire', 'throne', 'using', 'eyes', 'alone', 'early', 'days', 'Elizabeth', 'reign', 'see', 'queen', 'who', 'incredibly', 'inexperienced', 'niaive', 'same', 'time', 'Blanchett', 'performance', 'character', 'steel', 'such', 'emergence', 'later', 'days', 'iron', 'fist', 'not', 'seem', 'sudden', 'unbelievable', 'transition', 'velvet', 'Walsingham', 'played', 'perfection', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'written', '1/3', 'historical', 'character', '1/3', 'John', 'Dee', '1/3', 'Nicolo', 'Machiavelli', 'must', 'be', 'finest', 'performance', 'Rush', 'career', 'date', 'contest', 'Blanchett', 'truly', 'film', 'Fanny', 'Ardant', 'playing', 'Mary', 'Guise', 'vile', 'yet', 'sweet', 'seductiveness', 'only', 'can', 'powerful', 'performance', 'limited', 'time', 'screen', 'film', 'Kathy', 'Burke', 'mad', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'vilely', 'terrifying', 'Catholic', 'devotion', 'desire', 'eradicate', 'protestant', 'threat', 'comedienne', 'made', 'greater', 'stuff', 'past', 'given', 'credit', 'are', 'disappointing', 'performances', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'Duke', 'Norfolk', 'depth', 'coming', 'over', 'smug', 'bully', 'mental', 'agility', 'perform', 'political', 'feats', 'see', 'accomplish', 'film', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'one', 'most', 'overrated', 'actors', 'again', 'ability', 'portray', 'emotion', 'limited', 'exclusively', 'eyebrows', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Im', 'not', 'sure', 'role', 'was', 'written', 'cute', 'cocky', 'toy-boy', 'mind', 'J.', 'Fiennes', 'capable', 'what', 'see.What', 'truly', 'amazing', 'film', 'fact', 'almost', 'total', 'lack', 'action', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'fact', 'plots', 'counter-plots', 'intrigues', 'counter-intrigues', 'still', 'more', 'manages', 'keep', 'viewer', 'engrossed', 'rivetted', 'Yes', 'historical', 'events', 'were', 'modified', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'engrossing', 'bloodbath', 'end', 'actually', 'took', 'decades', 'complete', 'many', 'removed', 'were', 'done', 'so', 'exile', 'rather', 'assassination/execution', 'However', 'film', 'relies', 'substantially', 'ability', 'performers', 'carry', 'effect', 'Rush/Blanchett', 'others', 'do', 'magnificent', 'grace', 'eloquence', 'performances', 'manage', 'keep', 'mentally', 'engaged', 'throughout.Bearing', 'mind', 'Elizabeth', 'been', 'synonamous', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'most', 'minds', 'great', 'finally', 'have', 'performance', 'yet', 'brilliant', 'actress', 'not', 'only', 'favorably', 'perhaps', 'supercedes', 'Dame', 'Jackson', 'role']",N/A

Of course, Cate Blanchett is startling and forceful in her portrayal as Elizabeth... expertly reflecting the naivete and loss thereof as Elizabeth matures and undergoes the changes that will facilitate her becoming the Queen of England. Shaping these changes, of course, are the times, but also the characters who populate her life. First of all, Joseph Fiennes character, Sir Robert, appears to be Elizabeth's one and only love, and when she feels that love is betrayed, she takes it to heart and declares that England will be her only husband. This is a turning point, according to the movie, in her life, in which she sees the power and need of deceit, cunning, and also of warfare. Geoffrey Rush is his reliably talented self as Elizabeth's most adept and trusted advisor. (Strangely, of course, Fiennes and Rush both figure prominently in the film Shakespeare in Love, which was released at approximately the same time as Elizabeth. Joseph Fiennes's character may as well be the same, apart from the fact that in one film he is Shakespeare and in another he is Elizabeth's lover. In both pictures he is a man who falls in love with and seduces a woman he should not while married to someone else).

Elizabeth I lived from September 7th, 1533 until March 24th, 1603. She was called ""The Virgin Queen"" and was the fifth and last person to reign from the Tudor dynasty.She was the daughter of Henry VIII, born to Anne Boleyn, who reigned for a short period of time as Queen but was executed when Elizabeth was at the early age of three years old. As a result of her mother's history, Elizabeth was considered an illegitimate heir to the throne. Elizabeth is sent to London Tower under suspicion of supporting rebels of the Protestant faith, but she never confesses to the accusations that placed her there, and when Mary, her half sister dies, Elizabeth is crowned queen, supported by her Protestant subjects but despised by Catholics.The movie demonstrates how Elizabeth, masterfully played by Cate Blanchett, surrounds herself with great counsel and trusted advisers, among them William Cecil, the Baron of Burghley. One of the first acts as queen is to establish the English Protestant church and she becomes its Supreme leader. From the outset of her reign there is great pressure for Elizabeth to marry and produce an heir to the throne, but for many reasons you shall witness while watching the movie, she never marries and hence, she is known as the Virgin Queen. Thanks to the superbly loyal aide Walsingham, played in grand style by Geoffrey Rush, Elizabeth is able to uncover every plot to destroy her reign and she is able to check mate all attempts against her.The extra features provide interviews with the producer and we learn that Shekhar Kapur has followed every detail to provide authenticity as to the architecture and decorations of the time.

But after watching Elizabeth R, The Six Wives of Henry VIII and reading a number of historical books authored by reputable authors like Alison Weir, I found this film to be more along the lines of historical fiction. But some dialogue and details are so egregious they could not be overlooked. For example, Elizabeth saying 'This small issue of religion.' Even the atheists of the age wouldn't have dared say this more less a princess of the crown jewel of Christendom, whose father was at one time regarded as 'Defender of the Faith'(being Catholicism). Next, in the same scene, Norfolk says in response that it was religion that killed her mother. No, adultery was the charge, not heresy. The dots are not even in near proximity for such a claim. A little later, Walsingham makes a four inch slice on some kids neck and he dies? Who was he? Why did he want to kill Walsingham, why would a superficial 'flesh wound'no where near an artery kill him? Anyway, this is just my opinion and my desire is to help someone make a decision regarding the expenditure of time and money. If you are not a history buff, this movie may be entertaining.

But in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy, I also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Mary Tudor.  Over-zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict), she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes.  And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever.  I was sorely disappointed!If you want to get to know Elizabeth and the period in which she lived, I would recommend the superb BBC series, Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson.  And if you want even further background, look to the BBC again in the Six Wives of Henry VIII with Keith Mitchell.

461046,A2VE83MZF98ITY,6305358567,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[3, 4]","I love the movie 'Elizabeth'. It is quite interesting -- dramatic, well-acted, well-scripted, and just the right amount of intrigue and suspense for my taste. The characterisations of Elizabeth, Sussex, Sir William, Walsingham, and Robert Dudley are well done. What a pity that this is largely a work of fiction.I sometimes have a major 'beef' with movies of this sort; not at all the movie's fault, to be sure -- the tendency on the part of the public, who has not read, and will not bother to read afterward, the history of England during the Tudor period, to see which parts are based on fact, and which parts are dramatic license. From the very start of the film, I knew that this would be largely a fictional dramatisation -- upon the death of Henry VIII, in the credits, Mary assumes the throne. What happened to the poor boy King Edward? We skipped an entire reign! To say nothing of Lady Jane Grey. Of course, she had her own movie (also one of great liberty from the actual historical events)...The country was torn between Catholic and Protestant sentiments, as the film suggests, but these were not so neatly resolved (and in fact continue to this day to beset the Church of England, now a small minority of religious in England, with problems); Elizabeth, because she would not proclaim allegiance to the Catholic faith unreservedly, had a difficult time finding a bishop to perform the coronation (she had in the end the bishop of Carlisle).In this film, all of the intrigues that beset Elizabeth are collapsed and promulgated in the character of a few (Spanish, French, and Papist agents) all at the beginning of her reign. In fact, Elizabeth was in the process of securing her throne throughout most of her reign. The love affair with Lord Robert Dudley is most likely true in fact, if not in the form presented here. Walsingham was in fact her trusted ally; the bishops were in fact a problem caste. Sussex, the Lord Chamberlain as the plotter for the throne is an interesting detail -- to this day, the descendants of Sussex continue as Lords Chamberlain, and remain Roman Catholics, and must petition the Pope regularly to continue in their duties (a permission never denied).Perhaps the best facets of this film are in the mood, or style of the film. Going from uncertainty to certainty, growing in confidence and ability, going from being a girl who would be queen to a formidable woman who reigns, this is presented well in the space of a few hours. The settings, dark and medieval, not yet reflecting the glory of renaissance England which was about to be born under Elizabeth's reign; the costumes elaborate and strangely modern and medieval simultaneously (as is the story!); these things combine to make a great movie of power and intrigue.The equation of the Virgin Queen with the Virgin Mary is an interesting one, at the conclusion of the film, as Elizabeth becomes wedded to England. In fact, she had many suitors (many of whom lost their heads over her, literally), and the idea of 'virgin' is a rather different one today than during Elizabeth's time. Of course, the Tudors were always a rather randy bunch, and Elizabeth was in many ways, as she proclaimed in her own words, 'my father's daughter'. In the end, Elizabeth remains the only unmarried monarch of marriage-able age since William Rufus, son of William the Conqueror.The musical score, haunting and suspenseful, meditative and sombre, and finally triumphant, is memorable, but is in fact better experienced apart from the film, where the imagery and dialogue often overpowers the music.Acting is masterful, astutely played by Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush (who was nominated for the Academy Award for another Elizabethean period movie, Shakespeare in Love), Joseph Fiennes (who played Shakespeare in Shakespeare in Love), and Richard Attenborough. John Gielgud has a brief cameo appearance as the pope, but alas is fairly inconsequential in this film.In the end, 'Elizabeth' is a victorious movie.",5,"Historical in tone, if not in fact",1055635200,"06 15, 2003",2003,3989,"['love', 'movie', 'quite', 'interesting', 'dramatic', 'well-acted', 'well-scripted', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'intrigue', 'suspense', 'taste', 'characterisations', 'Elizabeth', 'Sussex', 'Sir', 'William', 'Walsingham', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'What', 'pity', 'largely', 'work', 'fiction.I', 'sometimes', 'have', 'major', ""'beef"", 'movies', 'sort', 'not', 'movie', 'fault', 'be', 'sure', 'tendency', 'part', 'public', 'who', 'not', 'read', 'will', 'not', 'bother', 'read', 'afterward', 'history', 'England', 'Tudor', 'period', 'see', 'parts', 'are', 'based', 'fact', 'parts', 'are', 'dramatic', 'license', 'very', 'start', 'film', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'largely', 'fictional', 'dramatisation', 'death', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'credits', 'Mary', 'throne', 'What', 'happened', 'poor', 'boy', 'King', 'Edward', 'skipped', 'entire', 'reign', 'say', 'nothing', 'Lady', 'Jane', 'Grey', 'course', 'had', 'own', 'movie', 'also', 'one', 'great', 'liberty', 'actual', 'historical', 'events', 'country', 'was', 'torn', 'Catholic', 'Protestant', 'sentiments', 'film', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'neatly', 'resolved', 'fact', 'continue', 'day', 'beset', 'Church', 'England', 'now', 'small', 'minority', 'religious', 'England', 'problems', 'Elizabeth', 'would', 'not', 'proclaim', 'allegiance', 'Catholic', 'faith', 'unreservedly', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', 'finding', 'bishop', 'perform', 'coronation', 'had', 'end', 'bishop', 'Carlisle', '.In', 'film', 'intrigues', 'beset', 'Elizabeth', 'are', 'collapsed', 'promulgated', 'character', 'few', 'Spanish', 'French', 'Papist', 'agents', 'beginning', 'reign', 'fact', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'process', 'securing', 'throne', 'most', 'reign', 'love', 'affair', 'Lord', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'most', 'likely', 'true', 'fact', 'not', 'form', 'presented', 'here', 'Walsingham', 'was', 'fact', 'trusted', 'ally', 'bishops', 'were', 'fact', 'problem', 'caste', 'Sussex', 'Lord', 'Chamberlain', 'plotter', 'throne', 'interesting', 'detail', 'day', 'descendants', 'Sussex', 'continue', 'Lords', 'Chamberlain', 'remain', 'Roman', 'Catholics', 'must', 'petition', 'Pope', 'regularly', 'continue', 'duties', 'permission', 'never', 'denied', 'best', 'facets', 'film', 'are', 'mood', 'style', 'film', 'Going', 'uncertainty', 'certainty', 'growing', 'confidence', 'ability', 'going', 'being', 'girl', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'queen', 'formidable', 'woman', 'who', 'presented', 'well', 'space', 'few', 'hours', 'settings', 'dark', 'medieval', 'not', 'yet', 'reflecting', 'glory', 'renaissance', 'England', 'was', 'be', 'born', 'Elizabeth', 'reign', 'costumes', 'elaborate', 'strangely', 'modern', 'medieval', 'simultaneously', 'story', 'things', 'combine', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'power', 'intrigue.The', 'equation', 'Virgin', 'Queen', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'interesting', 'one', 'conclusion', 'film', 'Elizabeth', 'wedded', 'England', 'fact', 'had', 'many', 'suitors', 'many', 'whom', 'lost', 'heads', 'literally', 'idea', ""'virgin"", 'rather', 'different', 'one', 'today', 'Elizabeth', 'time', 'course', 'Tudors', 'were', 'always', 'rather', 'randy', 'bunch', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'many', 'ways', 'proclaimed', 'own', 'words', 'father', 'daughter', 'end', 'Elizabeth', 'only', 'unmarried', 'monarch', 'marriage-able', 'age', 'William', 'Rufus', 'son', 'William', 'Conqueror.The', 'musical', 'score', 'haunting', 'suspenseful', 'meditative', 'sombre', 'finally', 'triumphant', 'memorable', 'fact', 'better', 'experienced', 'apart', 'film', 'where', 'imagery', 'dialogue', 'often', 'music.Acting', 'masterful', 'astutely', 'played', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'who', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Elizabethean', 'period', 'movie', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'who', 'played', 'Shakespeare', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'brief', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'pope', 'alas', 'fairly', 'inconsequential', 'end', ""'Elizabeth"", 'victorious', 'movie']",N/A

It brings home nicely the conflict between protestants and catholics, and the fact that Elizabeth allowed many catholic nobles to remain in her court.  But the period suffered from having too many Marys -- Mary Tudor (daughter of Catherine of Aragon), Mary of Guise, and Mary Queen of Scots.  The last is by far the best known to most Britons of today, and this movie confuses by totally excluding her.  I'm not a historian, but I spent most of the film assuming that Mary of Guise was another name for Mary Queen of Scots.  So I was perplexed when she was murdered in her bed, rather than beheaded at Fotheringay.  The failure to mention Babington or David Riccio also meant that another two of the principal characters of the era were omitted.  It would also have been nice to see the plot include  the suspected murder of Dudley's wife (in which Dudley and Elizabeth herself were implicated).But historical omissions aside, this is a sumptuous portrayal of the era, and a great means of getting people intrigued to discover more. (I went on to buy Michael Wood's IN SEARCH OF SHAKESPEARE as a result, for example).Cate Blanchett, who isn't English, performs the title role magnificently, by the way.

SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!This interesting biopic about Elizabeth I, the greatest monarch England has ever known, features excellent acting all around, but is grossly inaccurate on a lot of points. For starters, Robert Dudley, the Earl Of Leicester, WAS NEVER implicated in any plot against the Queen, and they remained close friends until his death. Secondly, at the beginning of the movie, the guard who comes to arrest Elzabeth calls out ""Princess Elizabeth!"" In reality, Henry VIII had Elizabeth stripped of her royal title as a public display of her illegitimacy and she was formally addressed as ""Lady Elizabeth."" Also, there's no evidence that Francis Walsingham (in reality in his 20's when Elizabeth ascended the throne) was involved in the death of Mary Of Guise, who in one scene, is riding in front of her troops. Back then, reigning women DID NOT ride at the front of their troops and rarely rode their horses with both legs over the side.

The fact was that, for that time period, Elizabeth wielded a great amount of power.  She was young, and one can just imagine how hard it must have been to assume the throne above many accusing one of heresy. Yes, the film shows the time it took Elizabeth to get used to her role as Queen of England. But even our modern rulers typically cannot bounce right into a prestigious political role without making mistakes or feeling unsure of their own abilities, especially not when despised by a portion of their own people.Especially toward the end of the film, I felt that a case was made for the strength of Elizabeth's character, rather than the weakness.I especially enjoyed the costumes and the poignant musical selections; both were quite realistic, vibrant, and strategically placed.I even felt that the historical portion of the movie was as well-done as can be expected from Hollywood.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film.

She became queen nearly by accident after a brother who tried to eradicate catholicism after Henry VIII in the most austere vision ever thought by anyone, then a sister who tried to eradicate protestantism in blood and fire. She understood that the better interest of the country was to stand on its own legs and to defy any alliance with Spain, France or the Pope. She decided that England was above everything, every personal and particular interest. She got rid of all those who were plotting either on the French side or the Spanish side and she declared herself married once and for all with England itself and no other person at all. She became the Virgin Queen in the blood of the plotters and she managed to make the interest of England the only objective of her reign and of all those who wanted some peace at home and abroad.

461077,A2OU415LB9I5J6,6305358567,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[2, 2]","Elizabeth, the bastard daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, is a Protestant, and considered an enemy of the Catholic Queen Mary. As more Protestants start an uprising against the Catholic throne, Mary brings Elizabeth before her to be tried and sentenced for treason as a heretic. Instead, Mary is unable to condemn her half sister to death, and tells her that she is dying of a tumor and when she dies Elizabeth will become queen. At the age of 25 Elizabeth becomes queen of England and must deal with affairs, death threats, attempted murder, and plots from within her own administration to become the Virgin Queen who brought England back to prosperity and prominence.In 1998, Cate Blanchett was an unknown having only appeared in bit parts here and there, but was more well known on the stage. After considering Nicole Kidman, and turning down Meryl Streep (one of only three roles she has ever been turned down for), Shekhar Kapur, an acclaimed Indian filmmaker making his English language debut, saw a trailer with Cate Blanchett and knew that he found the perfect Queen Elizabeth. And this was a daunting task. Queen Elizabeth is a well revered monarch, and not much is known about the early years of her reign. Piecing together what we know of Elizabeth's life and her reign, Michael Hirst crafted a screenplay that shows how Elizabeth became the queen, and woman, she would become. The question is, how well does it work.Elizabeth is possibly the most beautiful period piece I have ever seen. The cinematography is amazing, the sets and costumes are absolutely breathtaking, and Shekhar Kapur has an eye for bringing out the most in all of it. Shekhar Kapur also brings a more worldly view of the world as well, not just looking at this as the tale of British nobility, but looking at it as a story for the world of coming of age, politics, and religion mixing with politics and the dangers there in. Hirst's characters are well crafted and lived in, which typically is a problem for most period pieces dealing with real subjects. All too often characterizations suffer in these cases because there are so many people who helped make old mold your central character, but Hirst handles these issues deftly to craft great characters and you either empathize with or despise.The acting pedigree in this movie is stellar, and the ensemble cast of course makes the best of a great script. The real standout for me was Joseph Fiennes, currently the main character in Flashforward but also known for being in the other great period piece of 1998 Shakespeare in Love. Joseph Fiennes plays his character, Robert Dudley, with love, anger, malice, and sadness. He imbues him with such likability that, even at his worst, you feel every tick of emotion within the character, and Joseph Fiennes wrings ever bit of emotion from the character to the last drop without ever feeling as though he's going over the top. Naturally, though, when you're dealing with a cast that includes Geoffrey Rush (Pirates of the Caribbean), Christopher Eccleston (Dr. Who), Cate Blanchett (The Aviator), Daniel Craig (Casino Royale), Sir Richard Attenborough (Jurassic Park, and a phenomenal director in his own right see Ghandi), and so on saying one actor is a standout is like picking the best lawyer out of a group of Ivy League grads who all graduated at the top of their class.The one problem that I have to say that I have with this film is that the side plot dealing with Eccleston's Duke of Norfolk and the Vatican seemed slightly undercooked. It just didn't seem as though it was given the attention it needed, and in turn the Duke of Norfolk wasn't given enough to due. He's still fleshed out, but it feels as though your made to believe that he's the sole leader in a plot but I never really completely got the feeling that he was as in control as you were made to believe. Of course, when the real focus of the film is the coming of age of Queen Elizabeth I, this is almost an afterthought, and the plot still shows you how this led to Queen Elizabeth becoming the monarch she became.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes period pieces, history, and fans of the actors and actresses mentioned above. Personally, I think this is the best work from most of those mentioned above, including Cate Blanchett, which is saying a lot.4.5/5",4,Elizabeth,1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,4341,"['Elizabeth', 'bastard', 'daughter', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'Protestant', 'considered', 'enemy', 'Catholic', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'more', 'Protestants', 'start', 'uprising', 'Catholic', 'throne', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'be', 'tried', 'sentenced', 'treason', 'heretic', 'Instead', 'Mary', 'unable', 'condemn', 'half', 'sister', 'death', 'dying', 'tumor', 'when', 'Elizabeth', 'will', 'become', 'queen', 'age', '25', 'Elizabeth', 'becomes', 'queen', 'England', 'must', 'deal', 'affairs', 'death', 'threats', 'attempted', 'murder', 'plots', 'own', 'administration', 'become', 'Virgin', 'Queen', 'who', 'brought', 'England', 'back', 'prosperity', 'prominence.In', '1998', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'was', 'unknown', 'having', 'only', 'appeared', 'bit', 'parts', 'here', 'there', 'was', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'stage', 'considering', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'turning', 'down', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'one', 'only', 'three', 'roles', 'ever', 'been', 'turned', 'down', 'Shekhar', 'Kapur', 'acclaimed', 'Indian', 'filmmaker', 'making', 'English', 'language', 'debut', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'knew', 'found', 'perfect', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'daunting', 'task', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'well', 'revered', 'monarch', 'not', 'much', 'known', 'early', 'years', 'reign', 'Piecing', 'together', 'what', 'know', 'Elizabeth', 'life', 'reign', 'Michael', 'Hirst', 'crafted', 'screenplay', 'how', 'Elizabeth', 'became', 'queen', 'woman', 'would', 'become', 'question', 'how', 'well', 'work.Elizabeth', 'possibly', 'most', 'beautiful', 'period', 'piece', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'cinematography', 'amazing', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'Shekhar', 'Kapur', 'eye', 'bringing', 'out', 'most', 'Shekhar', 'Kapur', 'also', 'more', 'worldly', 'view', 'world', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'just', 'looking', 'tale', 'British', 'nobility', 'looking', 'story', 'world', 'coming', 'age', 'politics', 'religion', 'mixing', 'politics', 'dangers', 'there', 'Hirst', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'crafted', 'lived', 'typically', 'problem', 'most', 'period', 'pieces', 'dealing', 'real', 'subjects', 'too', 'often', 'characterizations', 'suffer', 'cases', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'helped', 'make', 'old', 'mold', 'central', 'character', 'Hirst', 'issues', 'deftly', 'craft', 'great', 'characters', 'either', 'empathize', 'despise.The', 'acting', 'pedigree', 'movie', 'stellar', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'course', 'best', 'great', 'script', 'real', 'standout', 'was', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'currently', 'main', 'character', 'Flashforward', 'also', 'known', 'being', 'other', 'great', 'period', 'piece', '1998', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'character', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'love', 'anger', 'malice', 'sadness', 'such', 'likability', 'even', 'worst', 'feel', 'tick', 'emotion', 'character', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'wrings', 'ever', 'bit', 'emotion', 'character', 'last', 'drop', 'ever', 'feeling', 'going', 'top', 'Naturally', 'though', 'when', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'cast', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Aviator', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Sir', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'phenomenal', 'director', 'own', 'right', 'see', 'Ghandi', 'so', 'saying', 'one', 'actor', 'standout', 'picking', 'best', 'lawyer', 'group', 'Ivy', 'League', 'grads', 'who', 'graduated', 'top', 'class.The', 'one', 'problem', 'have', 'say', 'have', 'film', 'side', 'plot', 'dealing', 'Eccleston', 'Duke', 'Norfolk', 'Vatican', 'seemed', 'slightly', 'undercooked', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'was', 'given', 'attention', 'needed', 'turn', 'Duke', 'Norfolk', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'due', 'still', 'fleshed', 'out', 'made', 'believe', 'sole', 'leader', 'plot', 'never', 'really', 'completely', 'got', 'feeling', 'was', 'control', 'were', 'made', 'believe', 'course', 'when', 'real', 'focus', 'film', 'coming', 'age', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'almost', 'afterthought', 'plot', 'still', 'how', 'led', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'becoming', 'monarch', 'became.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'period', 'pieces', 'history', 'fans', 'actors', 'actresses', 'mentioned', 'Personally', 'think', 'best', 'work', 'most', 'mentioned', 'including', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'saying', 'lot.4.5/5']",N/A

The characters, the costumes, and the production designs are good enough to make this movie watch able, but it's Blanchett who breathes life into the film and makes it cinema storytelling at its best.The story revolves around the rise of the young Queen Elizabeth I (Blanchett) who would soon become one of England's most powerful rulers. Reviled as a heretic by the Catholic Church, surrounded in the midst of traitors, and caught up in a romance with a young Lord that could jeopardize her crown, Elizabeth is forced to learn that as a queen... she must become untouchable in order to maintain her throne. The supporting cast does an excellent job with special nods to the ever elegant Geoffrey Rush, but it's Blanchett who manages to steal each and every scene. Her performance was more than Oscar worthy, and is surely one of her best.Some have compared this with `Shakespeare in Love' which includes two of the main leads from this film and was also released in the same year. Both are good films, but whereas `SIL' plays generally for laughs, Elizabeth is a serious film that should be taken seriously. There are historical plot holes - but these should not be used as a reason for slating the film. In fact it seems that Hollywood encourages this type of approach these days.

I'm unsure how  these same reviewers deal with Shakespeare. In his histories -- Richard II,  Henry IV parts 1 and 2, Henry V, Henry 6 (three parts), Richard III, etc.,  Shakespeare changes events for dramatic purpose. He tries to capture the  overall sweep of events and examine the important issues, while telling a  good story. At the same time, he moves events around, changes the ages of  characters, compresses things in time -- in short, all the same things that  the makers of Elizabeth did.Elizabeth is a fine film, capturing the  feel of the time, and getting the overall issues right, even if it changes  the details.

461087,A8F2AZWB20X1H,6305358567,JLind555,"[3, 3]","There is no question that Elizabeth I was the greatest Queen, and possibly the greatest monarch of either gender, that England ever had,and Cate Blanchett does an excellent job of bringing her vividly to life in Shekhar Kapur's film.  Elizabeth assumed the throne at a very young age and ruled England for over 40 years, during which time she guided her country from poverty and turmoil to peace and unpredecented power and prosperity.Blanchett expertly portrays Elizabeth's progress from a carefree adolescent with blooming with health and vitality, a frightened young woman expecting to be sent to the execution block at any moment by her spiteful sister Queen Mary who has been abandoned by her husband Philip of Spain and racked with pains from the cancer that is killing her, an insecure young monarch endeavoring to earn the respect of her court and her country, to a hardened woman approaching thirty, still young but no longer trusting anything but her own instincts.  Am I to be made of stone, feeling nothing? she demands after she has sent a number of traitors to the headsman.  And her answer to that question is to reinvent herself.  She will be re-virginized, married only to England and her people, devoting her life and her love to her country and her subjects.The film has been criticized as anti-Catholic and a good many of the villains in the movie are portrayed as Catholics trying to dethrone Elizabeth at best or kill her at worst.  It is a historical fact that the Vatican tried to destabilize her reign by declaring that no Catholic in England had to obey her or her laws and referred to Elizabeth as ""the heretical whore"" who had no right to occupy the throne in the first place.  Religion was the prime motivating force behind much of the conflict in 16th century England, with Mary Tudor burning Protestants at the stake and anti-Catholic regulations being promulgated after Mary's death.  There is no real anti-Catholic bias in the movie that I could find.  But the number of historical bloopers is mind-boggling, and the following are just a few of the more egregious ones:When Elizabeth is interrogated by a group of religious inquisitors at the beginning of the film, they claim that it was Anne Boleyn's heretical Protestantism that caused her to be executed.  Her religion had nothing to do with it.  Henry VIII had her put out of the way on a trumped-up charge of adultery and incest because he had fallen in love with another woman.William Cecil, portrayed as an old man in the movie, was still in his thirties at Elizabeth's accession.  He was her most trusted counselor and served her faithfully for 40 years until his death.  He was not put out to pasture as the film would have us believe.  And Francis Walsingham was not middle-aged as portrayed in the film; he was in his mid-twenties when Elizabeth became Queen.Lord Robert Dudley, who may or may not have been Elizabeth's lover, was a loyal friend until his death and never betrayed her in real life as he was said to have done in the film.  And as a hard-line Protestant all his life, he never converted to Catholicism.  The film shows Elizabeth as astounded and outraged when William Cecil breaks the news of Dudley's marriage.  In real life she couldn't have been all that surprised, as she attended the wedding.There is no evidence whatever that Walsingham was in any way involved in the death of Anne of Guise, who died only a year into Elizabeth's reign and not by poison.And so it goes.  The historical license may have made for more action and drama, but as history, ""Elizabeth"" falls way short of reality.The acting, however, can't be faulted on any account.  Cate Blanchett, as mentioned above, gives a knockout performance as Elizabeth, Geoffrey Rush is a compelling mixture of suavity and menace as Walsingham, Joseph Fiennes is marvelous as Robert Dudley, hopelessly in love with a woman he can never hope to have, John Gielgud and Richard Attenborough are outstanding in their respective roles as the Pope and William Cecil, and Kathy Burke is almost painful to watch as Mary Tudor, eaten up with cancer, hating and yet unable to sign the death warrant of the sister she knows will bring England back to the Protestantism she abhors and abominates.  I really wish I could give this film five stars.  But the appalling license taken with Elizabeth's life and reign forces me to withhold the last star and give it only four.Judy Lind",4,A very good film about a very great Queen,1251072000,"08 24, 2009",2009,4438,"['question', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'greatest', 'Queen', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'monarch', 'gender', 'England', 'ever', 'had', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'excellent', 'job', 'bringing', 'vividly', 'life', 'Shekhar', 'Kapur', 'film', 'Elizabeth', 'assumed', 'throne', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'ruled', 'England', '40', 'years', 'time', 'guided', 'country', 'poverty', 'turmoil', 'peace', 'unpredecented', 'power', 'prosperity.Blanchett', 'expertly', 'Elizabeth', 'progress', 'carefree', 'adolescent', 'blooming', 'health', 'vitality', 'frightened', 'young', 'woman', 'expecting', 'be', 'sent', 'execution', 'block', 'moment', 'spiteful', 'sister', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'who', 'been', 'abandoned', 'husband', 'Philip', 'Spain', 'racked', 'pains', 'cancer', 'killing', 'insecure', 'young', 'monarch', 'endeavoring', 'earn', 'respect', 'court', 'country', 'hardened', 'woman', 'approaching', 'thirty', 'still', 'young', 'longer', 'trusting', 'anything', 'own', 'instincts', 'Am', 'be', 'made', 'stone', 'feeling', 'nothing', 'sent', 'number', 'traitors', 'headsman', 'answer', 'question', 'reinvent', 'will', 'be', 're-virginized', 'married', 'only', 'England', 'people', 'devoting', 'life', 'love', 'country', 'subjects.The', 'film', 'been', 'criticized', 'anti-Catholic', 'good', 'many', 'villains', 'movie', 'are', 'portrayed', 'Catholics', 'trying', 'dethrone', 'Elizabeth', 'best', 'kill', 'worst', 'historical', 'fact', 'Vatican', 'tried', 'destabilize', 'reign', 'declaring', 'Catholic', 'England', 'had', 'obey', 'laws', 'referred', 'Elizabeth', 'heretical', 'whore', 'who', 'had', 'right', 'occupy', 'throne', 'first', 'place', 'Religion', 'was', 'prime', 'motivating', 'force', 'much', 'conflict', '16th', 'century', 'England', 'Mary', 'Tudor', 'burning', 'Protestants', 'stake', 'anti-Catholic', 'regulations', 'being', 'promulgated', 'Mary', 'death', 'real', 'anti-Catholic', 'bias', 'movie', 'could', 'find', 'number', 'historical', 'bloopers', 'mind-boggling', 'following', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'more', 'egregious', 'ones', 'When', 'Elizabeth', 'interrogated', 'group', 'religious', 'inquisitors', 'beginning', 'film', 'claim', 'was', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'heretical', 'Protestantism', 'caused', 'be', 'executed', 'religion', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'had', 'put', 'way', 'trumped-up', 'charge', 'adultery', 'incest', 'had', 'fallen', 'love', 'woman.William', 'Cecil', 'portrayed', 'old', 'man', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'thirties', 'Elizabeth', 'accession', 'was', 'most', 'trusted', 'counselor', 'served', 'faithfully', '40', 'years', 'death', 'was', 'not', 'put', 'out', 'pasture', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'Francis', 'Walsingham', 'was', 'not', 'middle-aged', 'portrayed', 'film', 'was', 'mid-twenties', 'when', 'Elizabeth', 'became', 'Queen.Lord', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'Elizabeth', 'lover', 'was', 'loyal', 'friend', 'death', 'never', 'betrayed', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'said', 'have', 'done', 'film', 'hard-line', 'Protestant', 'life', 'never', 'converted', 'Catholicism', 'film', 'Elizabeth', 'astounded', 'outraged', 'when', 'William', 'Cecil', 'news', 'Dudley', 'marriage', 'real', 'life', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'surprised', 'attended', 'wedding.There', 'evidence', 'whatever', 'Walsingham', 'was', 'way', 'involved', 'death', 'Anne', 'Guise', 'who', 'died', 'only', 'year', 'Elizabeth', 'reign', 'not', 'poison.And', 'historical', 'license', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'action', 'drama', 'history', 'Elizabeth', 'way', 'short', 'reality.The', 'acting', 'however', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'faulted', 'account', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'mentioned', 'knockout', 'performance', 'Elizabeth', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'compelling', 'mixture', 'suavity', 'menace', 'Walsingham', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'marvelous', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'hopelessly', 'love', 'woman', 'can', 'never', 'hope', 'have', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'are', 'outstanding', 'respective', 'roles', 'Pope', 'William', 'Cecil', 'Kathy', 'Burke', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'Mary', 'Tudor', 'up', 'cancer', 'hating', 'yet', 'unable', 'sign', 'death', 'warrant', 'sister', 'will', 'bring', 'England', 'back', 'Protestantism', 'abhors', 'abominates', 'really', 'wish', 'could', 'give', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'appalling', 'license', 'taken', 'Elizabeth', 'life', 'reign', 'forces', 'withhold', 'last', 'star', 'give', 'only', 'four.Judy', 'Lind']",N/A
461088,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,6305358567,Joanna Daneman,"[1, 1]","This stylishly filmed historical drama covers the ascendancy of Elizabeth to the throne of England. Cate Blanchett is excellent as the young princess Elizabeth, who survives the plotting of her half-sister Mary and her Catholic supporters and takes the throne upon the death of the childless queen.This film is more about holding on to a shaky throne by means of secret negotiations, assasination and conspiracy. There is little of the ""real"" history, though there is one tiny fragment of Elizabeth I's Tilbury speech (""I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king"") and a Reader's Digest version of the Marriage Speech to Parliament ends the film. So if you are a history buff, you may be disappointed, but if you like conspiracy and dark plotting, this is definitely your film.The cast is fine, with Cate Blanchett moving smoothly and believably from the young princess to the care-worn and nervous queen. Joseph Fiennes is good as Dudley, and I especially liked Geoffrey Rush as Walsingham.The cinematography is good, though the director seems to go overboard with top-down shots that give a great view of cathedral columns but get tiresome after the fifth or sixth time you peer at a scene from a pigeon's viewpoint. The sound on this DVD is particularly good--the surround sound was excellent.

Women historically have proven to be as capable as any man when it comes to ruling, and Elizabeth, as depicted in this film, is portrayed in a very strong, very proficient light.Cate Blanchett captures the authority of the noted queen perfectly, rapturing both her shy school girl resonance, then, as she is forced to either flee or fight, we see Elizabeth become the straightforward and forceful, but loyal, leader of England.The heart of the film deals with Queen Elizabeth's most deepened period of turmoil. The Roman Catholic Church has issued a private act of aggression on the queen, one that requires a number of assassination attempts. Mary Queen of Scots is involved, as is the Duke of Norfolk (the oh-so-British actor Christopher Eccelston). Where Elizabeth lacks momentary  initiative to rid herself of these enemies, she finds it in her very aggressive and very thorough aid, Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush). Even here, however, we sense that Elizabeth is entirely competent when it comes to these dealings.Elizabeth is a film that depicts the legendary queen as more than the stoic, unflinching woman many history books have painted her as. She is a woman who is deeply in love with a man in the early portions of her leadership, and one that is quite aware of what it means to be compassionate as well as acutely just. Later, we watch this love turn to her nation.The film is highlighted by memorable performances by Rush, Blanchett, Eccelston, and Joseph Fiennes, who plays Elizabeth's lover, Lord Robert Dudley.This is certainly no ""chick flick"" and is one of the most enjoyable films I've seen this year.",5,So much for stereotypes.,1137801600,"01 21, 2006",2006,1695,"['Cleopatra', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'Golda', 'Meir', 'Victoria', 'Catherine', 'Great', 'Women', 'historically', 'have', 'proven', 'be', 'as', 'capable', 'man', 'when', 'ruling', 'Elizabeth', 'depicted', 'film', 'portrayed', 'very', 'strong', 'very', 'proficient', 'light.Cate', 'Blanchett', 'authority', 'noted', 'queen', 'perfectly', 'rapturing', 'shy', 'school', 'girl', 'resonance', 'then', 'forced', 'flee', 'fight', 'see', 'Elizabeth', 'become', 'straightforward', 'forceful', 'loyal', 'leader', 'England.The', 'heart', 'film', 'deals', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'most', 'deepened', 'period', 'turmoil', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'issued', 'private', 'act', 'aggression', 'queen', 'one', 'number', 'assassination', 'attempts', 'Mary', 'Queen', 'Scots', 'involved', 'Duke', 'Norfolk', 'oh-so-British', 'actor', 'Christopher', 'Eccelston', 'Where', 'Elizabeth', 'momentary', 'initiative', 'rid', 'herself', 'enemies', 'very', 'aggressive', 'very', 'thorough', 'aid', 'Sir', 'Francis', 'Walsingham', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Even', 'here', 'however', 'sense', 'Elizabeth', 'entirely', 'competent', 'when', 'dealings.Elizabeth', 'film', 'legendary', 'queen', 'more', 'stoic', 'unflinching', 'woman', 'many', 'history', 'books', 'have', 'painted', 'woman', 'who', 'deeply', 'love', 'man', 'early', 'portions', 'leadership', 'one', 'quite', 'aware', 'what', 'be', 'compassionate', 'as', 'well', 'acutely', 'just', 'Later', 'watch', 'love', 'turn', 'nation.The', 'film', 'highlighted', 'memorable', 'performances', 'Rush', 'Blanchett', 'Eccelston', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'who', 'Elizabeth', 'lover', 'Lord', 'Robert', 'Dudley.This', 'certainly', 'no', 'chick', 'flick', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year']",N/A

461092,A25CQTB313XDWO,6305358567,"JON STRICKLAND ""Jon Strickland""","[1, 1]","Elizabeth is a fine movie featuring the many talents of Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, John Gielgud, Joseph Fiennes, Richard Attenborough, and more. Though not historically accurate, it is nonetheless a tribute to the monarch, who is displayed as a woman who progresses from an unassertive individual to one who, as Queen Elizabeth, has the power to create what is regarded as the Golden Age of England's history.Upon inheriting the throne from half-sister, Mary of Scots, Elizabeth is faced with legions of foes. Her opponents are those heading the Catholic church and are essentially looking for a theocrat who, as her predecessor had done, will continue to make Catholicism thrive and persecute those of other faiths. Elizabeth, however, is the antithesis of their desires, for she seeks to loosen ties with Rome and help establish a Church of England. Not only does this stance sit unfavorably with many religious and political leaders, but the very fact that she was not born into the Catholic faith leads many to disregard her as a true Queen of England.Throughout the movie, the rivals and, to a certain extent, supporters of Elizabeth meet with forces from France, Spain and Rome to undermine her authority as Queen of England. She is faced with various choices as given to her by her initial advisors: If she marries the ruler of either France or Spain, then she will become the wife of a leader whose empire is mightier than hers and thus make England subordinate, or if she decides to no longer continue as Queen, then the doorway will be open for the Catholic massacres to continue.Elizabeth decides neither, for she wants to remain in power without having to marry a powerful individual she does not love or even like. Upon resolution, she changes her administration and appoints a confidant who is well aware of the political and religious scenes that threaten her security to the throne.Intermittently in the picture, there is one supporter who lacks confidence in her ability simply because of her gender. As an ultimate response that seems to set the tone for the remaining third of the picture, she firmly retorts that she is her father's daughter and that if she chooses so, she can have the heart of a man.It is from that scene that the viewer might be led to think that perhaps Elizabeth wants to replicate Henry VIII's reign and that the determination to ""think like a man"" will lead her to triumph. But I say that that they are only pieces of the formula, because with time she is revealed as an intelligent person who is increasingly cunning.And when she finds out that her once intimidating opponents now want her dead after discovering that they have placed their signatures on documents that declare her an ""illegitimate"" heir ... she sees clearly where things unequivocally stand and can then face this hateful resistance like a woman scorned...",5,One Medieval Queen,1034899200,"10 18, 2002",2002,2873,"['Elizabeth', 'fine', 'movie', 'featuring', 'many', 'talents', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'more', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'nonetheless', 'tribute', 'monarch', 'who', 'displayed', 'woman', 'who', 'unassertive', 'individual', 'one', 'who', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'power', 'create', 'what', 'regarded', 'Golden', 'Age', 'England', 'history.Upon', 'inheriting', 'throne', 'half-sister', 'Mary', 'Scots', 'Elizabeth', 'faced', 'legions', 'foes', 'opponents', 'are', 'heading', 'Catholic', 'church', 'are', 'essentially', 'looking', 'theocrat', 'who', 'predecessor', 'had', 'done', 'will', 'continue', 'make', 'Catholicism', 'thrive', 'persecute', 'other', 'faiths', 'Elizabeth', 'however', 'antithesis', 'desires', 'loosen', 'ties', 'Rome', 'help', 'establish', 'Church', 'England', 'Not', 'only', 'stance', 'sit', 'unfavorably', 'many', 'religious', 'political', 'leaders', 'very', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'born', 'Catholic', 'faith', 'many', 'disregard', 'true', 'Queen', 'England.Throughout', 'movie', 'rivals', 'certain', 'extent', 'supporters', 'Elizabeth', 'meet', 'forces', 'France', 'Spain', 'Rome', 'undermine', 'authority', 'Queen', 'England', 'faced', 'various', 'choices', 'given', 'initial', 'advisors', 'ruler', 'France', 'Spain', 'then', 'will', 'become', 'wife', 'leader', 'empire', 'mightier', 'hers', 'thus', 'make', 'England', 'subordinate', 'longer', 'continue', 'Queen', 'then', 'doorway', 'will', 'be', 'open', 'Catholic', 'continue.Elizabeth', 'decides', 'remain', 'power', 'having', 'marry', 'powerful', 'individual', 'not', 'love', 'even', 'resolution', 'administration', 'confidant', 'who', 'well', 'aware', 'political', 'religious', 'scenes', 'threaten', 'security', 'throne.Intermittently', 'picture', 'one', 'supporter', 'who', 'confidence', 'ability', 'simply', 'gender', 'ultimate', 'response', 'set', 'tone', 'remaining', 'third', 'picture', 'firmly', 'father', 'daughter', 'so', 'can', 'have', 'heart', 'man.It', 'scene', 'viewer', 'might', 'be', 'led', 'think', 'perhaps', 'Elizabeth', 'replicate', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'reign', 'determination', 'think', 'man', 'will', 'lead', 'triumph', 'say', 'are', 'only', 'pieces', 'formula', 'time', 'revealed', 'intelligent', 'person', 'who', 'increasingly', 'cunning.And', 'when', 'out', 'once', 'intimidating', 'opponents', 'now', 'want', 'dead', 'discovering', 'have', 'placed', 'signatures', 'documents', 'declare', 'illegitimate', 'heir', 'clearly', 'where', 'things', 'unequivocally', 'stand', 'can', 'then', 'face', 'hateful', 'resistance', 'woman', 'scorned']",N/A

Yes, it's that good, an unforgettable and unmissable motion picture event!When catholic Queen Mary (Kathy Burke) dies the succession goes to Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett), the protestant half-sister Mary was not prepared to execute. The new queen finds herself surrounded by advisors, some supportive but some plotting to restore the catholic line by almost any means. She is also under pressure to marry and produce an heir, but her lover Lord Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes) is not considered suitable. Elizabeth realises she has some decisions to make, the most important being who rules England.Shekar Kupar's film is the first to actually take us back in time and feel like we're in every situation, going through every trouble the character's get into. It's a remarkable thing to feel like you're there, and I have Kupar to thank for that, his direction is marvellous, his effort for this film was astounding. Cate Blanchett's performance is also very unique, the best performance of 1998 by a long shot, she pulls off Queen Mary with power and elegance.

In place of Al Pacino's Michael Corleone, we have Cate Blanchett's young princess Elizabeth, and the movie traces her gradual hardening into glittering, ruthless Queen of England.  Except that the movie doesn't really do this gradually; it foists the change upon us in a series of unconvincing set-pieces.  Early in the film, the Princess is a frolicsome young thang, and it would seem, no virgin.  Joseph Fiennes'  young nobleman is unequivocally her lover.  So far so good, and pointlessly revisionist.  But whatever.  Later she's an imperious young queen who, unaccountably, now spurns her former lover.  (Unaccountable because history tells a much different story.  As a result of too much dramatic license, Shekhar Kapur's film is often rendered incomprehensible.)  At the end, Elizabeth glides across Westminster Hall, apparelled like a really haughty mime.  None of it makes much sense.Nor does the court intrigue.  I've seen this movie twice, and perhaps I'm dumb but I still don't quite understand the details of the Duke of Norfolk's  (?)  plot to do away with Elizabeth.  There are vengeful monks, poisoned bodices, and Geoffrey Rush's Walsingham, whose role in all this is rather unclear.  And who is Norfolk  (am I getting the name right?)  sleeping with?  Mary Queen of Scots?  Or someone else?  Did I miss something?There's a gratuitous amount of erotic heat in  *Elizabeth*  coupled with a deplorable lack of clarity.  You know something?  Considering how well-documented this time-period is in English history, I find the lack of concern for historical accuracy pretty annoying.  The fascinating materials are already there; why invent?

Had I seen this in the theater, I would probably have gotten up and walked out after seeing Mary de Guise murdered in her bed by Sir Francis Walsingham for the sake of ""compressing"" history and the personae of Mary de Guise and her daughter, Mary Queen of Scots.  Mary de Guise was deposed by her own nobles in 1559, and died of dropsy in 1560 - she represented next to no threat to Elizabeth (quite the reverse: the rise of Scottish Protestantism was a threat to Mary de Guise). Her daughter Mary Queen of Scots was beheaded by Elizabeth many years later after quite a long time spent imprisoned in the Tower.  Only the presence of actors like Blanchett, Rush, and Eccleston kept me watching. Then there was the presentation of the young Elizabeth as wavering and tentative and easily cowed, when in fact one of the factors in her survival of a very dangerous youth was her composure, brilliant mind, and oratorical gifts; and, most absurdly, a wildly erotic sex scene between Fiennes and Blanchett in an open space where her ladies in waiting (and anyone else who cared to) enjoyed the spectacle, a piece of recklessness so out of character for the wily, man-dodging Elizabeth that it beggars description.I was the more disgusted because, knowing how appallingly badly educated Americans are when it comes to history (more than half of teens polled recently couldn't give the dates of the Civil War), I am sure three quarters of the audiences in this country walked out thinking that they had just been shown the truth.There is NO excuse for this.  NONE.  I see from the ecstatic reviews that most people either don't know any better or worse, just don't care - it is a sad commentary on their standards.  I wonder if the director had a good time trying to cut down to size one of history's greatest female leaders?For the record, Blanchett is splendid as the young Elizabeth, Joseph Fiennes decent but uninspiring (as he always seems to be) as the feckless Sir Robert Dudley, Geoffrey Rush amazing (as HE always seems to be) as the canny Walsingham, and Christopher Eccleston baleful and forbidding as the Catholic Duke of Norfolk, sworn to bring down what he considers a heretic and illegitimate Queen (the Norfolks still lead England's minority Catholic nobility).  Daniel Craig has a small role in this film as one of Norfolk's co-conspirators in treason - as always, Craig is compelling to watch even briefly.

461104,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,6305358567,K. Driscoll,"[6, 6]","Elizabeth is a beautifully shot film directed by Shekhar Kapur.  The cast was a whose who of future stars and past cinema giants.  The cast includes Geoffrey Rush, Christopher Eccleston, Kelly MacDonald, Daniel Craig, Vincent Cassel, Emily Mortimer, Richard Attenborough, Fanny Ardant, Joseph Fiennes and of course Cate Blanchett.  It is screen legend John Gielgud's final picture before his death at the age of 96 and he gets to play the Pope.  English pop singer Lily Allen also appears in a small role when she was just 12 years old.  The film portrays the early part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England.  She is the bastard child of King Henry VIII and Anne Bolyn, and was queen for 45 years starting in 1558 and until her death.  The period she ruled was often regarded as the most significant period of growth in England's past.  Her legacy is a positive one and she is often recognized as the most highly regarded British monarch in history.The film follows how Elizabeth became queen after Mary I of England's death.  It deals with many issues regarding the fact that she is Protestant and was imprisoned for allegations that she planned to assassinate Queen Mary I.  She is released when Mary I dies and Elizabeth becomes queen.  Many conspire against her, from Catholics to the Scots and the French.  It also follows Elizabeth's love affair with Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes).  The film ends fittingly with Elizabeth's reign entering stability just before the beginning of the English Renaissance.  I say fittingly because a sequel to Elizabeth is being released this fall and it will no doubt exhibit the true nature of Elizabeth's legacy and the reverence held toward her to this day.  It covers a more interesting period in my opinion.I actually had a problem with the concept of this film.  The nature of this period in Elizabeth's life didn't sit well with me in terms of transferring to a motion picture.  The way liberties are taken with historical facts inject drama effectively and actually makes up for what should've been a fairly anti-climactic story.  So her life becomes a bit of soap opera.  Part of me thinks that if the film was pure history it still could've been good but perhaps not has marketable.  I found it enjoyable either way.  The sets and costumes are incredible and the cinematography is also worth praising.  The real strength in Elizabeth is Cate Blanchett.

And ultimately,""did the film move along?"" The answer is a RESOUNDING YES to Kapur's film.Is it historically accurate?....ehh!...somewhat yes,a lot maybe,some definitely not;BUT I am rating a film,not history.Wikipedia has loads of information on all of the characters and events in this film for anyone to learn more.I will say this,that no version of The Virgin Queen's life is 100% accurate simply because not everything is known for certain involving many of the ""players"" in Elizabeth Tudor's Reign.So, those that like Helen Mirren,good.If you prefer Glenda Jackson's performance, magnificent.If you need historical accuracy,you best not see any of them!!! As a film, though,this ELIZABETH for style and substance,is my favorite.Cate Blanchett and the entire ensemble is first class.I was surprised to see Daniel Craig as the murderous priest.Boy, has he gone on to great success since killing off Kelly MacDonald!I am eagerly anticipating the sequel,ELIZABETH:THE GOLDEN AGE to see Cate go after Mary Queen of Scots this time!Again,will she be beheaded with one,two or three axe swings and did a little dog run out from under her skirts???

Actually she met him when she was forty five years old and I had no indication from the text that the duke was a queer cross dresser. The movie also depicts him as a drunk. During scenes of Mary Tudor's reign everything is ugly and dark. The rooms are lit with ugly short stumpy candles, the furniture is nasty. As soon as Liza comes to the throne she gets much nicer rooms to live in. All natural sunlight comes in from the ceiling, white pillars and beautiful ""marble?"" floors appear. Liza must have redecorated extensively. This is not Tudor architecture.I loved this movie but I wish Directors would read books. They also portray her wearing that hard white makeup in her twenties which no portrait of her at that age can verify. She didn't do that. She didn't wear wigs presumably until about the age of forty. Grey hair or whatever prompted this change. The actor cast as Dudley looks nothing like him but Kate is the image of Elizabeth. I guess they thought the real Dudley wasn't cutey studly enough.

After finally seeing the movie, I wonder how many of the  voices applauding it actually understood what was going on!The plot  (such as it is) simply covers the first few years of Elizabeth I's reign  &amp; the political machinations of the great magnates who surrounded her.  For someone familiar with Tudor history it is an enjoyable re-creation of a  world glimpsed dimly thru the portraits of Hans Holbein &amp; others. For  those who did not study their English history, I suspect this film might be  incomprehensible. The Dukes, Earls, Bishops &amp; other powerful men who  make up Elizabeth's court are not introduced in any way in the film. They  wear similar hair cuts, facial hair &amp; clothing so as to make them  difficult to identify upon entering a scene. The political motives of those  who choose to support the Pope over Church of England (which was different  from Protestantism) are not shown, nor is any clarity thrown of Mary de  Guise's role. She is simply portrayed as a meddlesome seductress, &amp; the  screen writers seem to have confused her with Mary Queen of Scots (her  daughter).Of course, Cate Blanchett is luminous as Elizabeth. She  certainly deserves all the accolades that were heaped upon her &amp; it  will be hard to ever picture Elizabeth I as looking any other way. Joseph  Fiennes as Dudley  does not share the resemblance to his historical  counterpart, &amp; I find him too modern to be believable. The interiors  are dark &amp; gloomy, which is a shame as the design seems to be  excellent. It is obvious the director wanted the spotlight on his actors,  not his scenery!Personally, I found the ending ruined the rest of the  movie for me. It has no basis in history, &amp; does not even seem logical  based upon the script thus far. It is nothing more than a simplistic way to  bring a conclusion where none exists.

While watching this film, that's not what I was thinking about at all.  The entire drama is an interpretation of the uncertain early reign of this young, brave queen.  And things have been altered but only to enhance artistically an actual historical time and place.  The way director Shekhar Kapur used his sets, filming his lead characters through grates and red veils, framing each scene so equisitely is breathtaking.  He uses everything around the characters in order to give an emotional charge and electricity to an otherwise over-trodden stale tale of her steady and absolute monarchial power.  And enough cannot be said of Cate Blanchett's performance!  She was delicate and then suddenly powerful, and the way she always has another emotion lurking behind her eyes is marvelous.  You see how these four different men in her life struggle to protect, love, serve, and destroy her.  The relationship between Elizabeth and Dudley is wonderful.  It displays themes of how power, trust, and love coincide. Enough said!  The casting is perfect, the locations are sumptous, and the costumes and sets are lavish and beautiful.

Bernabo,"[6, 8]","Most films featuring Elizabeth has focused on the mature queen, dealing with the threat of the Spanish Armada or the problematic presence of Mary Queen of Scots, so a film focusing on the young Elizabeth in the early days of her reign is certainly a worthwhile perspective.  Unlike 1953's &quot;Young Bess,&quot; where Jean Simmons' Elizabeth still had to contend with the daunting presence of Henry VIII (Charles Laughton reprising his Oscar winning role), &quot;Elizabeth&quot; presents a princess in danger of losing her life and a young Queen whose throne is very much at risk.Cate Blanchet's performance has more depth than the scenes and dialogues allow.  What probably kept her from winning the Oscar was that she really does not have .  The closest is when she prepares for her speech to Parliament, which was certainly set up to be the moment where she proves her worthiness to the audience if not her people, but the scene does not provide the anticipated payoff.  Nor are there any choice lines that are burned into your mind while watching the film, although there certainly could have been something along the lines that everyone was so concerned with who her mother was that they forgot her father was Henry VIII.  Simply compare the opportunities Blanchet has in this film with what Katharine Hepburn was given in &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; and you will see that this performance in &quot;Elizabeth&quot; transcends the limitations of the script.  The supporting cast features such illuminaries as John Gielgu and Richard Attenborough, but it is Geoffrey Rush, Christopher Eccleston and Jospeh Finnes who stand out and give the story its true gravity.Shekhur Kapur's direction does not stand out as much as the art direction and costume design, which makes &quot;Elizabeth&quot; one of the most stunning period pieces since &quot;Restoration.&quot;  It is rather interesting that for the most part the good guys have traditional bears and semi-flowing locks while the bad guys have buzz cuts, which lend a severity to their appearances.  You do have nice symmetry between the opening of the film where the Protestant heretics are being shaved and the closing sequence where Elizabeth's own hair is shaved as she is transformed into the stunning Virgin Queen.The DVD offers directors commentary from Kapur that is certainly above average as such things go and a making of &quot;Elizabeth&quot; featurette that is actually not as good as the notes in the enclosed booklet.

Cate Blanchett deservedly won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama. She is truly the heir apparent to Bette Davis and Glenda Jackson, both having portrayed Elizabeth I in memorable performances. Cate Blanchett now joins their ranks with her own incredible performance in that role.The movie begins in 1554, in an England that is bitterly divided on the issue of religion. Ruled by Mary Tudor, Henry the VIII's oldest daughter and a devout catholic, protestants are being burned at the stake as heretics, giving rise to Mary's popular name, &quot;Bloody Mary&quot;. Reviled by her Spanish husband and in poor health, Mary is badgered by her advisors to do away with Elizabeth, her considerably younger, bastard half-sister. This Mary will not do, no matter how pressed. Still, Elizabeth lives her life with the sword of Damocles hanging over her head at all times.When Mary dies, Elizabeth takes the throne, no more than a mere slip of a girl wearing the crown of England. Her advisors look to guide her, and she follows their lead, until she determinedly takes control of the reins of power, and follows her own counsel with the help of her most trusted advisor, Francis Walsingham, played to cunning perfection by Geoffrey Rush. With his help, she is able to fend off the ever present threats to her hold on the throne of England, not just from her own courtiers, but from Marie de Guise, Queen of Scotland, deliciously played by Fanny Ardent.In the film one sees the transformation of Elizabeth take place. She goes from being a young woman, really no more than a girl, who is in love with Robert Dudley, the Duke of Leicester, dashingly played by Joseph Fiennes, to the commanding woman history would ultimately come to know as the Virgin Queen. Confronted cruelly with the politics of intrigue and betrayal, she learns that to stay in power and effectively lead her people, she must rule with her head and not with her heart. She succeeded brilliantly, leaving a rich legacy that would be remembered as the Elizabethan era.This film is an absolute masterpiece. While not quite historically accurate, the film is a broad overview of what happened when Elizabeth first took the reins of power. It also attempts to explain why Elizabeth I would be known as the Virgin Queen. This film is a lush and lavishly costumed medieval tapestry that is woven with great care. It is, without a doubt, a magnificent movie that will hold the viewer in its thrall.

This Mary really, really hates Elizabeth, and is about maybe this close to killing her. Lots of other intriguers don't like Elizabeth, either, and they would like to see her destroyed too. Luck is on Elizabeth's side, though, and she outlives her half-sister to become Queen at 25.The intrigue doesn't end here, though; in fact, you might say it's just beginning. Who will Elizabeth marry? Will the Old Catholics be successful in overthrowing her and placing their own man on the throne? Is there anybody, man or woman, that Elizabeth can trust in this whole realm?Well, if you don't already know enough English history to answer a few of those questions, I won't spoil things for you. I really enjoyed this movie myself. You get a sense of the perils that filled Elizabeth's every moment. Cate is a marvelous Queen Bess, and we see her metamorphose into the Queen who would be King, because in her time, women didn't count for very much in their own right. The real Elizabeth had often to refer to herself in masculine terms in order to project strength enough to subdue those who would attempt to topple her from power.

My initial impression that the film was historical mush was mightily confirmed.There is no historical reality to the characters, especially to the character of Elizabeth who, by the time in which the movie begins, was already a shrewd and wily politician, who had managed to survive two serious plots against both her brother, Edward VI and her sister, Mary I, in which she was implicated.  she was definitely not a naive innocent, needing complete guidance.  In addition, the damage to such characters as Burghley, who, instead of being the shrewd lawyer and politician in his 40s,as he was, is shown as a fussy, doddering old man, or Walsingham, who in reality was a very sober, strict Bible believing Puritan, and is shown as a homosexual murderer.  Indeed, if I were one of their descendents I would sue the producers!There is no logic to the plot, which not only telescopes time in the usual manner of historical films (i.e., jamming 20 years into 1, going forward), but even telescopes past into present.  Add to that the dimly lit sets (in which nearly all interiors appear to have been filmed in Durham Cathedral) and the often odd camera angles and any plot rationality is lost, although there was little of it in any case.The overall effect is one of historical gibberish.  About the best thing I can say is that a handful of scenes are at least somewhat evocative and suggest that the costumers did make an effort at doing the historical research which the writers, director and producer clearly did not.

I felt it was a bit too graphic/bloody & turned my stomach a bit which is not necessary for a good historical drama as I have seen many of them.  Also the history was not accurate.  I don't think there is historical proof that Queen Elizabeth had carnal relations with Earl Robert Dudley although they were good friends & very fond of each other.  Elizabeth was too smart for that & she wouldn't have wanted to become pregnant out-of-wedlock.  Also she was never alone, having ladies in waiting & other court personnel constantly around her person. She was also aware that the Earl was married to Amy Robsart. Robert Dudley was politically ambitious & most likely used his relationship with Elizabeth to further his cause at court.  Also the film portrayed Elizabeth as uncertain of herself & weak, & as Henry VIII's daughter I'm sure she was much more in command - she had to be in order to survive - which she did quite well.  I prefer Glenda Jackson's portrayal of Elizabeth as more historically accurate & how a queen would comport  herself.  There was too much emphasis on the erroneus sexual aspect between Dudley & Elizabeth & the scene of the French prince in drag I found obnoxious, & this was not historically accurate either.  The musical score was good, although not quite historically accurate however, blending Mozart with Elizabethan music.

461130,AN7JDZOXH1WC4,6305358567,"Matthew Easterbrook ""silverscreenjunkie""","[4, 6]","ELIZABETH is the biography of arguably the most famous monarch in British history.  But make no mistake about it, this is no stately costume drama.  Director Shekhar Kapur, in his English-language debut, makes sure of that.  What we have is a very modern GODFATHER-type epic, set in 16th-century  Britain, whose style reminded me of a toned down version of Baz Luhrmann's  ROMEO + JULIET.Cate Blanchett is absolutely amazing to watch as she  evolves from innocent youth to hardened political powerplayer.  Geoffrey  Rush is also extremely good as the sinister Walsingham.  Joseph Fiennes,  Ralph's little brother, plays Elizabeth's lover Robert Dudley in this  picture.  Fiennes seems to be a less intense actor than his brother, which  works well for this role.  He actually reminded me of a British Tom Hanks,  if such a thing is possible.  Vincent Cassel as the Duc D'Anjou is a hoot  as well.  The rest of the actors are pretty good, except for the two Sirs,  Richard Attenborough and John Gielgud.  Gielgud's part amounts to nothing  more than a glorified cameo, but he does what he can with the role.  Attenborough, on the other hand, just stands there and says his lines.  One  of the worst performances I've ever seen him give.The acting is not the  only thing that makes ELIZABETH a delight.  Director Kapur uses many modern  innovations, including using jump cuts for a scene where Elizabeth  rehearses a speech, and the climax, which reeked of THE GODFATHER.  The  subtle cinematography by Remi Adefarasin is both striking and evocative,  and adds to the rich tapestry of the film, especially the sets by John  Myhre and costumes by Alexandra Byrne.  Although Kapur condenses and  exaggerates a few facts in order to suit his vision, ELIZABETH makes for an  exciting, entertaining (if somewhat fictionalized) history lesson.",4,It's not personal ... it's strictly politics,952646400,"03 10, 2000",2000,1835,"['ELIZABETH', 'biography', 'arguably', 'most', 'famous', 'monarch', 'British', 'history', 'make', 'mistake', 'stately', 'costume', 'drama', 'Director', 'Shekhar', 'Kapur', 'English-language', 'debut', 'sure', 'What', 'have', 'very', 'modern', 'GODFATHER-type', 'epic', 'set', '16th-century', 'Britain', 'style', 'reminded', 'toned', 'down', 'version', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'ROMEO', '+', 'JULIET.Cate', 'Blanchett', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'watch', 'innocent', 'youth', 'hardened', 'political', 'powerplayer', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'also', 'extremely', 'good', 'sinister', 'Walsingham', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Ralph', 'little', 'brother', 'Elizabeth', 'lover', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'picture', 'Fiennes', 'be', 'less', 'intense', 'actor', 'brother', 'well', 'role', 'actually', 'reminded', 'British', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'thing', 'possible', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'Duc', ""D'Anjou"", 'hoot', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'actors', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'two', 'Sirs', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'Gielgud', 'part', 'nothing', 'more', 'glorified', 'cameo', 'what', 'can', 'role', 'Attenborough', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'lines', 'One', 'worst', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'give.The', 'acting', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'ELIZABETH', 'delight', 'Director', 'Kapur', 'many', 'modern', 'innovations', 'including', 'using', 'jump', 'cuts', 'scene', 'where', 'Elizabeth', 'speech', 'climax', 'reeked', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'subtle', 'cinematography', 'Remi', 'Adefarasin', 'striking', 'evocative', 'rich', 'tapestry', 'film', 'especially', 'sets', 'John', 'Myhre', 'costumes', 'Alexandra', 'Byrne', 'Kapur', 'condenses', 'few', 'facts', 'order', 'suit', 'vision', 'ELIZABETH', 'exciting', 'entertaining', 'somewhat', 'fictionalized', 'history', 'lesson']",N/A
461131,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305358567,Matthew Horner,"[2, 3]","Elizabeth sweeps across the screen with a splendor and a self-assuredness rarely found in the movies these days. Unlike most historic epics, it has only an average running time. It does not need three to four hours to unfold. It races out of the gate in the first scene and stays on course through its brilliant, mesmerizing finish. It is a film to be savored, and it reminds us that, at their best, movies are truly an art form.If you are the type of history buff who insists on accuracy, then Elizabeth will disappoint you. Even Shekhar Kapur, the gifted director whose vision this movie is, admits that this is a romantic interpretation of the early life of one of the world's greatest rulers. I feel that, unless a movie's makers claim they are being totally factual, artistic license is as permissible in this medium as it is in others. Besides, it isn't easy to take several years worth of events and cram them into two hours. One has to hit the highlights and be coherent while doing so. Kapur's plan was to capture the spirit and the feel of 16th Century England. He has succeeded brilliantly.I can think of no young actress other than Cate Blanchett who could have played Elizabeth so well. One effect of modern times seems to be that our emotional growth is slower. While immensely talented, a Gwyneth Paltrow or a Kate Winslett doesn't yet have the maturity to play such a part. The role requires that Blanchett go from an innocent girl, who does not believe she will ever be more than a princess, to an uncertain queen in charge of a derelict, poor country, to an iron-willed, worldly monarch who would make England the world's most powerful nation. Blanchett's portrayal of Elizabeth's mental and physical transformations is acting of the highest order.Do not think for a moment that this is a woman's picture. To quote Elizabeth, &quot;I can think like a man if I have to.&quot; There is certainly romance. Her failed love affair with Lord Robert Dudley [Joseph Finnes] is a centerpiece of the movie. Yet Elizabeth is also filled with intrigue, betrayal, deceit, lust, power, and warfare. Scotland was not under British rule, and Queen Mary was longing to invade. Both France and Spain had plans to annex England. It had not been long since Henry the Eighth had broken with the Roman Catholic church, and the Vatican was plotting revenge. It was not the most opportune time for anyone to ascend the throne.The supporting cast is remarkable. Joseph Finnes smartly plays Robert Dudley as an intelligent but vulnerable character. Geoffrey Rush's Sir Francis Walshingham is someone who is alone in being be utterly loyal to Elizabeth, yet who is also one of the most sinister and ruthless people imaginable. Both of these actors also starred in that other Elizabethan event, Shakespeare in Love. What a year is was for them! And what a year for movies made in the UK!At the Oscars, Elizabeth was blown away by the delightful and far more commercial Shakespeare in Love; however,at the British Academy Awards, the Virgin Queen won in a staggering twelve categories, including Best Picture and, of course, Best Actress.",5,One of my Top Ten of 1998,1016841600,"03 23, 2002",2002,3127,"['Elizabeth', 'screen', 'splendor', 'self-assuredness', 'rarely', 'found', 'movies', 'days', 'most', 'historic', 'epics', 'only', 'average', 'running', 'time', 'not', 'need', 'three', 'four', 'hours', 'unfold', 'gate', 'first', 'scene', 'course', 'brilliant', 'mesmerizing', 'finish', 'film', 'be', 'savored', 'best', 'movies', 'are', 'truly', 'art', 'form.If', 'are', 'type', 'history', 'buff', 'who', 'accuracy', 'then', 'Elizabeth', 'will', 'disappoint', 'Even', 'Shekhar', 'Kapur', 'gifted', 'director', 'vision', 'movie', 'romantic', 'interpretation', 'early', 'life', 'one', 'world', 'greatest', 'rulers', 'feel', 'movie', 'makers', 'claim', 'are', 'being', 'totally', 'factual', 'artistic', 'license', 'permissible', 'medium', 'others', ""n't"", 'easy', 'take', 'several', 'years', 'events', 'cram', 'two', 'hours', 'One', 'hit', 'highlights', 'be', 'coherent', 'doing', 'so', 'Kapur', 'plan', 'was', 'capture', 'spirit', 'feel', '16th', 'Century', 'England', 'succeeded', 'brilliantly.I', 'can', 'think', 'young', 'actress', 'other', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'so', 'well', 'One', 'effect', 'modern', 'times', 'be', 'emotional', 'growth', 'slower', 'immensely', 'talented', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Kate', 'Winslett', ""n't"", 'yet', 'have', 'maturity', 'play', 'part', 'role', 'Blanchett', 'go', 'innocent', 'girl', 'who', 'not', 'believe', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'more', 'princess', 'uncertain', 'queen', 'charge', 'derelict', 'poor', 'country', 'iron-willed', 'worldly', 'monarch', 'who', 'would', 'make', 'England', 'world', 'most', 'powerful', 'nation', 'Blanchett', 'portrayal', 'Elizabeth', 'mental', 'physical', 'transformations', 'acting', 'highest', 'order.Do', 'not', 'think', 'moment', 'woman', 'picture', 'quote', 'Elizabeth', 'quot', 'can', 'think', 'man', 'have', 'to.', 'quot', 'certainly', 'romance', 'failed', 'love', 'affair', 'Lord', 'Robert', 'Dudley', '[', 'Joseph', 'Finnes', ']', 'centerpiece', 'movie', 'Elizabeth', 'also', 'filled', 'intrigue', 'betrayal', 'deceit', 'lust', 'power', 'warfare', 'Scotland', 'was', 'not', 'British', 'rule', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'was', 'longing', 'invade', 'France', 'Spain', 'had', 'plans', 'annex', 'England', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'long', 'Henry', 'Eighth', 'had', 'broken', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'church', 'Vatican', 'was', 'plotting', 'revenge', 'was', 'not', 'most', 'opportune', 'time', 'anyone', 'ascend', 'throne.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'remarkable', 'Joseph', 'Finnes', 'smartly', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'intelligent', 'vulnerable', 'character', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Sir', 'Francis', 'Walshingham', 'someone', 'who', 'alone', 'being', 'be', 'utterly', 'loyal', 'Elizabeth', 'yet', 'who', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'sinister', 'ruthless', 'people', 'imaginable', 'actors', 'also', 'starred', 'other', 'Elizabethan', 'event', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'What', 'year', 'was', 'what', 'year', 'movies', 'made', 'UK', 'Oscars', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'delightful', 'far', 'more', 'commercial', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'however', 'British', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Virgin', 'Queen', 'won', 'staggering', 'twelve', 'categories', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'course', 'Best', 'Actress']",N/A

We learn that they are Protestants, and that they don't agree with the religious beliefs of Queen Mary (Kathy Burke), a Catholic. Soon enough, a young woman is also arrested. She is Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett), stepsister to Mary, and a Protestant. Elizabeth is accused of treason, and sent to the Tower, in order to wait for her fate to be decided...Of course, nothing happens, and our main character continues to live allowing the film to continue, but those first scenes give us a glimpse of what kind of life Elizabeth must have led in her youth, amid constant fear of execution and whispers of betrayal. Not much afterwards, though, Queen Mary dies and Elizabeth becomes Elizabeth I. She will have more power, but also new responsibilities and different threats...Elizabeth will have to deal with the pressure of most of her advisors to choose soon among the candidates that have asked for her hand in marriage, but she is unable to marry the one she loves, Lord Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes). She is surrounded by many Catholic-led conspiracies, and by quite a few that wish her ill, starting by the powerful Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston). Despite that, and thanks to her inner strenght and the counsel of a new advisor, Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), Elizabeth slowly becomes a ruler who is not afraid to make difficult decisions to stay in power, even if that involves killing those who plot against her. She seems to remember that ""I am my father's daughter. I am not afraid of anything"".I believe that this movie tackles quite well the idea of how difficult it was to be a woman with power in Elizabeth's time, and how far a female ruler had to go to retain that power. The cast is superb, although I think that it is possible to say that Cate Blanchett's performance is the most remarkable one. I would like to add that the art direction was quite good, and that it helped to recreate the atmosphere of days long gone...Of course, I am aware of the fact that this film is full of historical inaccuracies, but I already knew that it wasn't a documentary. Despite that, ""Elizabeth"" left me wanting to know more about the period in which all these events happened, and I am probably going to read a book on it  :)On the whole, I highly recommend this film. It is interesting, and different. ""Elizabeth"" doesn't have much to do with historical reality, but it was inspired by it, and it might spur you to learn more about the period through other sources.

I even had the feeling that, perhaps, The Academy of Arts and Sciences should have preferred it over  ""Shakespeare in Love"" for their  Best Picture Oscar Award, or/and, not just nominate, but elect Cate  Blanchett as Best Actress Ex Equo with Gwyneth Paltrow !After all, both  films are made in the (US/UK) English continuum, they walk us back in time  to the same Golden Age of Queen Elizabeth I, they even share performers:  Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes.  Admittedly, ""love conquers all"" - we all  empathize with lovers and a love story - but I believe it is Cate Blanchett  the one who has a much greater burden: ""becoming"" the Queen of England  !Blanchett is convincing as the young 25 years old Elizabeth, daughter  of Henry 8th, who, ""on-the-job"", and upon advise and help from trusted  friends develops the maturity, experience, and sophistication absolutely  necessary to play the role she was meant for:  the greatest woman monarch  of all times.  Geoffrey Rush, playing Sir Francis Walsingham is equally  convincing as her mentor, shrewd diplomat, and effective ""secret service""  agent.  The conflict with the Church subordinated to the Vatican, the  complicated and never predictable ""political dance"" with neighboring  ""superpowers"" of the time, Spain and France, the more predictable conflict  with men, such as The Duke of Norfolk, the costumes, the music, dances, the  decoration - all are exquisitely laid out in front of us ! Blanchett brings  to life, Elizabeth, a  woman who has her own passions and more or less  secret lovers (Robert Dudley Earl of Leicester, played by Fiennes - better  performance opposite Gwyneth Paltrow), but, when she says ""I am queen now  !"" she realizes she can never surrender (authority, control) to anyone, and  has but one spouse:  England !Enjoy a great film !",5,&quot;I Am Queen Now !&quot;,948326400,"01 20, 2000",2000,1900,"['am', 'not', 'exactly', 'fan', 'royalty', 'liked', 'have', 'great', 'praise', 'film', 'even', 'had', 'feeling', 'perhaps', 'Academy', 'Arts', 'Sciences', 'should', 'have', 'preferred', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'Award', 'or/and', 'not', 'just', 'nominate', 'elect', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Ex', 'Equo', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'films', 'are', 'made', 'US/UK', 'English', 'continuum', 'walk', 'back', 'time', 'same', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'even', 'share', 'performers', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Admittedly', 'love', 'conquers', 'empathize', 'lovers', 'love', 'story', 'believe', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'one', 'who', 'much', 'greater', 'burden', 'becoming', 'Queen', 'England', 'Blanchett', 'convincing', 'young', '25', 'years', 'old', 'Elizabeth', 'daughter', 'Henry', '8th', 'who', 'on-the-job', 'advise', 'help', 'trusted', 'friends', 'maturity', 'experience', 'sophistication', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'play', 'role', 'was', 'meant', 'greatest', 'woman', 'monarch', 'times', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'playing', 'Sir', 'Francis', 'Walsingham', 'equally', 'convincing', 'mentor', 'shrewd', 'diplomat', 'effective', 'secret', 'service', 'agent', 'conflict', 'Church', 'subordinated', 'Vatican', 'complicated', 'never', 'predictable', 'political', 'dance', 'neighboring', 'superpowers', 'time', 'Spain', 'France', 'more', 'predictable', 'conflict', 'men', 'such', 'Duke', 'Norfolk', 'costumes', 'music', 'dances', 'decoration', 'are', 'exquisitely', 'laid', 'out', 'front', 'Blanchett', 'life', 'Elizabeth', 'woman', 'who', 'own', 'passions', 'more', 'less', 'secret', 'lovers', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'Earl', 'Leicester', 'played', 'Fiennes', 'better', 'performance', 'opposite', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'when', 'am', 'queen', 'now', 'can', 'never', 'surrender', 'authority', 'control', 'anyone', 'one', 'spouse', 'England', 'Enjoy', 'great', 'film']",N/A

Berquist,"[1, 1]","When I watched &quot;Elizabeth&quot; my girlfriend brought up something I hadn't thought much of- imagine, she said, of how difficult things must have been for Queen Elizabeth when she came onto the throne in the middle  of the 16th century given how little society at the time educated women.  The pressures of ruling a country divided at home between Protestants and  Catholics, and menaced abroad by the ambitions of France and Spain, were  bad enough. As a woman, Queen Elizabeth had to endure another difficult  barrier to successfully governing England. That this woman was able not  only to survive, but to thrive and lead England into what many call the  realm's Golden Age, is nothing short of miraculous.&quot;Elizabeth&quot;  is a film by Shekhar Kapur about the coming of age of what may have been  England's greatest monarch- Queen Elizabeth. It is an exceptional film  about an exceptional figure from history. Cate Blanchett is the title  character and she can only be described as brilliant in the role. Her  character goes from terrorized to uncertain to confidant, from a beautiful  and vibrant young woman to a cold and cruel Queen. Blanchett pulls off the  performance in spades. This is an actress with some serious talent.I  also enjoyed Geoffrey Rush's performance as Elizabeth's loyal advisor. Rush  is a talented actor (&quot;Shine&quot;, &quot;Shakespeare In Love&quot;)  who pulls off the part with relish- cold, menacing, calculating.I found  the dark conspiracy against Elizabeth that dominated the second half of the  film took away, somewhat, from the overall feel of the film. The second  half of the film is, to a certain extent, Rush's film. This is not a bad  thing, mind you, but the second half of the film leaves Elizabeth reacting  to events more than initiating them. Casting-wise Joseph Fiennes and  Richard Attenborough turn in good performances as Elizabeth's lover and  principle advisor.&quot;Elizabeth&quot; is, on the balance, an amazing  film about a difficult historical figure to pin down. The strengths of this  film are in its two leads- Blanchett and Rush are both outstanding.

461142,A3RINLIDX74QLP,6305358567,"Monika ""equestrienne_23""","[27, 30]","Queen Elizabeth I of England is one of the most impressive figures in European history. She came to the throne in 1558 at the age of twenty-five, upon the death of her half sister, Mary I. It was a time of much political instability, and the young Queen's task was made even more difficult by the fact that her legitimacy was by no means universally acknowledged (many saw her father Henry VIII's marriage to Elizabeth's mother, Anne Boleyn, as being invalid, since he was never granted a Papal dispensation for the annulment of his first marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Mary's mother), and by the fact that Elizabeth was a Protestant. And on top of all this, many of the English people were far from jubilant at the prospect of another female ruler, after the disastrous reign of her sister Mary. The years immediately following Elizabeth's ascent to the throne, therefore, were fraught with uncertainty and danger. In order to retain her crown and win the hearts of her people, Elizabeth would have to become a strong, almost superhuman figure, and it is this formative process that the film ""Elizabeth"" seeks to show us.Unfortunately, the film does not entirely succeed. Elizabeth reigned for 44 years, an extremely long time. Her maturation and the development of her status as a national icon were shaped by a series of trials, both political and personal, that took place over the course of multiple decades. It would be nearly impossible to accurately show all this in a 2-hour movie. ""Elizabeth"" suffers from the fact that the makers of the film simply tried to cram too much material into the 124 minutes they had to work with. It could be called a ""Cliffs Notes"" version of Elizabeth's story - the film provides a sketchy overview, but you wouldn't want to rely on this as your primary source of information. Many events are truncated, jumbled together, and even shown out of historical order, with the effect that they make very little sense. One would have to have considerable knowledge of Elizabeth's life before seeing the movie to really understand what is supposed to be happening in many of the scenes. The relationship between events is not readily apparent from the movie itself. But the problem, for those that come to the movie with previous knowledge if Elizabeth, is that they will also notice all the historical inaccuracies in the film. And there are many.For one, there is no evidence whatsoever that the relationship between Elizabeth and Robert Dudley was ever sexual, yet very early on in the film there is a sex scene between the two. That they loved each other very much is undisputed, but Elizabeth was rarely left alone, even in her private chambers, being almost constantly attended by her ladies in waiting, and there would have been very little opportunity for her to let the relationship go so far. Furthermore, Elizabeth would have been aware of the inherent risks in having a sexual relationship - primarily that of becoming pregnant. In addition, she knew she could never marry Lord Robert, for he was already married to Amy Robsart (and she did indeed know of this, though the film seems to imply that she was unaware of it prior to Cecil's announcement of the fact), and Dudley was also extremely unpopular with most of the members of court, and it is unlikely that Elizabeth would have risked her throne - a very real danger - by carrying out a sexual affair with him.Even more confusing, the latter part of the film implicates Dudley as a co-conspirator in a plot against Elizabeth. This makes no sense at all. Though there were times when the real Dudley incurred the Queen's displeasure, and fell temporarily out of favor, their disagreements were usually short-lived, and the two remained good friends their entire lives. Dudley's last letter to Elizabeth was a love letter, and when Elizabeth herself died years later, this letter was found on the table beside her bed. Another discrepancy is the fact that the Duke of Anjou shown in the film is the wrong Duke of Anjou. Elizabeth was indeed courted by Henry, Duke of Anjou, and he did indeed cross-dress, but he never visited her. Much later his younger brother Francis, who took on the title after Henry ascended the throne of France as Henry III, took up the suit of Elizabeth, and he was the one who travelled to England. But he was never known to cross-dress. The film also implies that Francis Walsingham conspired to assassinate Mary of Guise, regent of Scotland. First of all, it was Cecil and not Walsingham who was sent to Scotland, and secondly, Mary of Guise died of dropsy. There are numerous other, more minor inaccuracies, but it would be tedious to list them all here. For more information on the real Elizabeth, I highly recommend the biography ""The Life of Elizabeth I"" by Alison Weir.On the flipside, the film is saved by Cate Blanchett's magnificent portrayal of Elizabeth herself. Blanchett definitely deserved her Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, and she alone is the reason I actually added this movie to my collection. She is also the only reason I would ever have even watched this movie more than once. Blanchett has a very strong screen presence, and really captures the intricacies of Elizabeth's character. She is the backbone of the film, without which it would undoubtedly have crumpled into a shapeless mess. The other actors - primarily Joseph Fiennes as Robert Dudley, Richard Attenborough as William Cecil, Geoffrey Rush as Sir Francis Walsingham, and Christopher Eccleston as the Duke of Norfolk - do admirable jobs, but the ways in which the film skews their characters undermine their performances. The only other thing I would really commend this film for is its costuming, which is magnificent. Elizabeth's wardrobe alone is stunning. The DVD Special Features are decent, though not overly impressive. There are two trailers, two featurettes on the making of the film, a photo gallery, and information on cast and crew.",3,"The ""Cliffs Notes"" version of the life of Elizabeth I.",1107561600,"02 5,

461143,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,6305358567,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[5, 5]","The big-screen movie adaptation of the early years of Elizabeth I starts with the arresting image of a group of preachers being burnt at the stake in the reign of Mary I.  After her death the 25 year-old Elizabeth succeeds her and the movie basically chronicles the queen's loss of innocence as she learns the pressure and pain of being the monarch.As a history student, this is hardly what you might call historically accurate.  Indeed, the subtext with Robert Dudley is spiced up here.  However, most of this comes to cramming such a monumentous event as a queen's reign into the running time.  This is definitely a historical epic for the 21st century in that it is vibrant and full of intrigue, blood and sex.  This is only too apparent in several memorable scenes, especially the ending, which sees the execution of Northumberland and Elizabeth's hair being shorn off due to her brush with smallpox.  In many ways this is a kind of feminist theatre, with Elizabeth attempting to prove herself to her council, scared of subordination if she marries.  The idea of a woman on the throne was of particular significance at the time, with three queens in Europe - Elizabeth, Mary Queen of Scots and Catherine deMedici effectively ruling France.  If there's one scene which lingers long in the mind though, it's the pillar of strength that Elizabeth is forced to become when the film ends and we see her proclaim that she is married to her people.Cate Blanchett's performance is extraordinary as her wide-eyed innocence gradually becomes the stern face of resilience.

461149,A232JQR4NBH9SX,6305358567,Nikola,"[3, 4]","Elizabeth the person was great, and so is Elizabeth the movie. It is a highly romanticized adaptation of Elizabeth I's turbulent life.  she went from being sentenced to death at the infamous London Tower, to being England's strongest female monarch in history.The movie opens with scary shots of people being burned to death by Queen Mary I, also known in history as Bloody Mary. A devoted catholic, there was one thing Mary hated more than protestants, and that was her  half-sister Elizabeth, who not only was a protestant, but also a threat to strip the childless Mary of her title. Elizabeth is therefore imprisoned, but suddenly dies, which makes Elizabeth the queen. We are soon invited to see what really happens among royalty, as Elizabeth deals with the questions of marriage, love, war, conspiracies and power.The movie has two stellar qualities. The first one is Kate Blanchett, who plays the title character with ease and skill. Instead of expressing her emotions only through her voice, she takes advantage of her body language - the way Elizabeth walks and dances is never the same, and sometimes all Blanchett needs to do is move her hand in order to express a sentiment. The second big thing about this movie is the direction. The director, Shekhar Kaphur, not only wisely exploits all Blanchett has to offer, he decides not to change the pace of the movie by adding more action or drama. Instead, he sticks with dialogue which is more than enough - the scenes where Elizabeth defends herself from the accusations and the preconceptions of her councilors are exciting and dramatic, despite their minimalistic concept. Also, the texture, color palette and composition are important aspects of the movie - the setting, color scheme, costuming and light always reflect the feelings Elizabeth is hiding behind her pale faade.""Elizabeth"" is undeniably a masterpiece. However, it will not appeal to everybody - some will find the subject uninteresting, or its pace monotonous. People who decide to truly follow it, think about it and enjoy it, though, will find the stellar cast (including the ever-watchable co-stars Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Fiennes, Vincent Cassel and Daniel Craig), fantastic crew and the wonderful English feel to it make this movie a royal treat, something to indulge in again and again.",5,A royal treat,1171238400,"02 12, 2007",2007,2316,"['Elizabeth', 'person', 'was', 'great', 'so', 'Elizabeth', 'movie', 'highly', 'romanticized', 'adaptation', 'Elizabeth', 'turbulent', 'life', 'went', 'being', 'sentenced', 'death', 'infamous', 'London', 'Tower', 'being', 'England', 'strongest', 'female', 'monarch', 'history.The', 'movie', 'scary', 'shots', 'people', 'being', 'burned', 'death', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'also', 'known', 'history', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'A', 'devoted', 'catholic', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'Mary', 'hated', 'more', 'protestants', 'was', 'half-sister', 'Elizabeth', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'protestant', 'also', 'threat', 'strip', 'childless', 'Mary', 'title', 'Elizabeth', 'therefore', 'imprisoned', 'suddenly', 'dies', 'Elizabeth', 'queen', 'are', 'soon', 'invited', 'see', 'what', 'really', 'royalty', 'Elizabeth', 'deals', 'questions', 'marriage', 'love', 'war', 'conspiracies', 'power.The', 'movie', 'two', 'stellar', 'qualities', 'first', 'one', 'Kate', 'Blanchett', 'who', 'title', 'character', 'ease', 'skill', 'Instead', 'expressing', 'emotions', 'only', 'voice', 'advantage', 'body', 'language', 'way', 'Elizabeth', 'walks', 'dances', 'never', 'same', 'sometimes', 'Blanchett', 'needs', 'do', 'move', 'hand', 'order', 'express', 'sentiment', 'second', 'big', 'thing', 'movie', 'direction', 'director', 'Shekhar', 'Kaphur', 'not', 'only', 'wisely', 'Blanchett', 'offer', 'not', 'change', 'pace', 'movie', 'adding', 'more', 'action', 'drama', 'Instead', 'dialogue', 'more', 'enough', 'scenes', 'where', 'Elizabeth', 'accusations', 'preconceptions', 'councilors', 'are', 'exciting', 'dramatic', 'minimalistic', 'concept', 'Also', 'texture', 'color', 'palette', 'composition', 'are', 'important', 'aspects', 'movie', 'setting', 'color', 'scheme', 'costuming', 'light', 'always', 'reflect', 'feelings', 'Elizabeth', 'hiding', 'pale', 'faade', 'Elizabeth', 'undeniably', 'masterpiece', 'However', 'will', 'not', 'appeal', 'everybody', 'will', 'find', 'subject', 'uninteresting', 'pace', 'monotonous', 'People', 'who', 'decide', 'truly', 'follow', 'think', 'enjoy', 'though', 'will', 'find', 'stellar', 'cast', 'including', 'ever-watchable', 'co-stars', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'fantastic', 'crew', 'wonderful', 'English', 'feel', 'make', 'movie', 'royal', 'treat', 'something', 'indulge', 'again', 'again']",N/A

Since then I truly realized Hollywood didn't care about real talent but who was hot at the moment. Cate had a lot of things against her: she wasn't American and she wasn't the "" conventional "" beauty though I think she's ten times more beautiful than most of the women on the big screen now. All you need to know is this is the best Elizabeth film ever made!  Since I saw it I became a Cate Blanchett fan and bent down to kiss the ground to show god how glad I was to finally find a truly great actress since the 80's.

I believe Elizabeth (I) would have been honored to have such a powerful presence portray her as Cate Blanchett did.  Cate stripped the character of tasteless glamour and became the virgin queen right before our eyes. If there was ever a woman born to play a role it was Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth. If you don't see this film you are missing a wonderful version starring a mesmerizing, charming little lady who took acting to new heights.

461157,A2GHTSBU7IHIBO,6305358567,Owen Hughes,"[2, 3]","I liked the way this film started and ended. The middle, on the other hand, was filled (at times) with filler. By that I mean obligatory scenes which really lent nothing of major interest to the main story. In so doing,  the film also managed to lose itself historically, so that you had to be a  very well-informed viewer to keep up with who was who and what was  happening and why. I can imagine the director saying to himself, ""I'll make  it an historically accurate piece....No, I won't, I'll make it into a love  story and let the history stand aside a little....On second thoughts, I'd  better keep the history strong....,"" and so on, never really deciding one way  or the other. For a time, it was obvious that the temptation of rewriting  history and according Lord Dudley Robert a greater place than was in fact  his, passed through the director's mind. Shades of ""Shakespeare in Love,""  indeed, where Joseph Fiennes played a somewhat similar role, but one which  was more in keeping with the type of script, if not with the actual  history.It must have been difficult to avoid giving centre-stage time  to characters like Norfolk and Walsingham. The latter, in the guise (if you  will forgive me for saying so) of Elizabeth's eminence grise, was  definitely overdone. Norfolk, besides acting out of character (I felt) on  more than one occasion, gave up the ghost rather too easily, further  strengthening the reputation of the ""heretic"" living at the queen's right  arm. As for Gielgud's Pope, I think he must have enjoyed every minute of it  (there were about four), but I didn't buy it at all.I must say I  especially liked the end of the film. After having proclaimed herself  ""mistress,"" there was, in a sense, nothing more to say. The final scene was  very well done. Certainly, Elizabeth the First's subsequent reign was such  that you could make several more movies about it. Overall, the film was  pleasing without being great cinema. For its history, it's of some  interest, but not if you are trying to peer into Elizabethan England for  the first time.

As far as I can tell, this film has got all its historical facts right, but not necessarily in the right order. However, as a piece of historical drama, this is pretty good stuff. The Tudor dynasty was a violent period, and the opening shot of heretics being burnt at the stake captures that period perfectly. Murder, intrigue, torture, and espionage are the currency of power and no one is safe, not even a Queen. The sheer horriblness of this period is what makes it so fascinating, and Shekhar Kapur doesn't let us down. The drama is so taut and well paced that I am gripped by this film each time I see it. The acting is spot on. Does Dickie Attenborough ever put on a bad performance? However, Cate Blanchett is a revelation. I had never seen her before this film, but was held entranced by her. A wonderful performance by a fine actress whom I am sure will go on to have a great career. My only criticism would be that she is maybe a little too beautiful to play good Queen Bess.

I believe ""Shakespeare in Love"" was a big hit that year and I passed them both off as costume dramas.  I watched ""Elizabeth"" last night and discovered that this is NOT your traditional costume drama.  It is, at times, a dark look at the intrigue of royal politics while, at other times, a bright view of a young lady coming of age in a variety of ways.  The intrigue is well-presented.  We don't always know exactly what's going on but, then, why should we be any different from the participants.  There is enough blood and guts to suggest a warning for those in search of a romantic movie.  Yet this is blood and guts with a purpose.  This is England in the midst of one of its' greatest crisies and we are reminded that, with the stakes so high, the ruthlessness rose as well.  Much of the history of the early reign of Elizabeth was new to me and I'm sorry to say that.  We know of how she led England to its' greatest level of power but I certainly wasn't aware that it all got off to such a fascinatingly fragile beginning.  I took a moment to check my old English History textbook (Willson) and found enough brief mentions of characters and events to let me know that this is a biographical movie based in fact.  I won't elaborate but you will probably come to the same conclusion as I did that there were a number of poetic licenses issued in the making of ""Elizabeth"".  I was enthralled with the way this lesser known history was presented.The subject, of course, is in the movie's title and it is the development of this young lady that is its' crowning (sorry) achievement.  Elizabeth discovers that, when you can trust no one else, you have to learn to trust yourself.  This development in her is brought out in a convincing series of personal glimpses and events.  I kept hoping that this was actually a three or four hour movie because I realized time was running out and I wanted to watch this development continue much further.  In the end, the writer and director gave us just what we needed to realize that Elizabeth had reached the level of maturity and self-confidence that would take her into the realm of greatness.  The rest, as they say, is history and one that I was pretty comfortable with.  Regardless of the accuracy of every detail in the movie, ""Elizabeth"" gave me a greater appreciation of just who England's greatest queen really was.

I wondered while picking this up how even a fraction of the tale of Elizabeth's rise to power could be depicted in two hours; for some reason I'd thought this movie was almost twice that long. And perhaps I wasn't paying close enough attention, or perhaps this film requires repeated viewings to really grasp its brilliance. Or, maybe, it's a chick flick. (Check the ratings breakdown at IMDB.com. Suddenly I don't feel nearly as bad about not liking this as much as everyone else seemed to.)It's certainly not a bad film, though I think a good deal of the supporting cast's roles were written to be overplayed, which is the same problem I have with many period dramas. It just seems as if it's there as a kind of Cliffs Notes version of Elizabeth's rise to power. Maybe I'm wrong in this, but given the many, many accolades received by the film, I expected something more-- piercing, original insight into Elizabeth's character, a new take on her inner circle of advisors, a revelation that she actually wasn't a virgin, something.

461173,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,6305358567,Robert Blake,"[3, 4]","""Elizabeth"" is a visually stunning and powerfully written film based on one of the great monarchs in history. Some reviewers here shamelessly slam the movie based on ""historical inaccuracies."" They forget drama is not meant to be seen for research for tomorrow's homework assignment, the great dramatists like Shakespeare regularly re-wrote history when doing a drama. And even then, the script makes valid attempts to look behind the icon of Elizabeth (there is very substantial evidence that she was not really a virgin in the sexual sense and that Robert Dudely was a lover). Director Shekhar Kapur gives us a rich tapestry of characters and locations, feelings and history. An Indian, Kapur paints his movie with the lush textures of India, but he keeps a wonderful English feel to it all and Cate Blanchett is magnificent as Elizabeth, conveying strength, fear and compassion. Richard Attenborough, Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes all deliver noteworthy performances as well. The screenplay by Michael Hirst is smart, poetic and full of political intrigue. The music by David Hirschfelder is marvelous, it creates mood and provides some rich melodies like the love theme. What Kapur does with great success here is transport us to another world and time, we feel like onlookers viewing a great drama unfolding. There is pure suspense in how Elizabeth must find a way to survive and overcome her enemies. Someone complained here about the violence, obviously this person has not read that much history and well babe, history is pretty bloody. ""Elizabeth"" is a powerful experience, you can view it for the characters and drama and simply enjoy the cinematography, which is done with the eye of a painter. The costumes and light are all used to create an almost dreamy effect. And of course there is the human side of the film. It's a story about the courage to advance when thrust into a position of authority and if needing to be alert and intelligent when navigating the turbulent waters of power.

461175,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,6305358567,Robert Morris,"[1, 2]","Briefly, here is the historical context.  Elizabeth I (1533-1603) was queen of England and Ireland from 1558 to 1603. During the brief reign of her brother, Edward VI, Elizabeth barely survived, especially in 1549 when those in her household were arrested and she was placed in what we now call protective custody until November 17, 1558, when her half-sister Mary died, and Elizabeth succeeded to the throne. One of her first actions as queen was to appoint Sir William Cecil (later Lord Burghley) as her chief secretary and he continued as her closest adviser. Both were aware of England's vulnerability to France and Spain. Both also knew that the key to England's success lay in playing the two great powers against each other so that neither could bring its full force to bear against England. The defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 eliminated one serious threat to England's security and also created almost unlimited opportunities for exploration, settlement, and economic growth. When Elizabeth died in 1603, Britannia really was ""queen of the oceans.""Directed by Shekhar Kapur and starring Cate Blanchett, this film examines Elizabeth's gradual transformation from being a free-spirited, lusty, at times reckless, and often silly young princess to becoming a sanitized, somber, and worldly-wise monarch. Several key figures are centrally involved in this process, notably Mary (Kathy Burke) and Cecil (Richard Attenborough), Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes), the Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston), and especially Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush). Throughout her adult years, especially when protected by Walsingham, Elizabeth survived numerous assassination attempts and died of natural causes in 1603.For me, Walsingham is at least as interesting in this film as the queen to whom he is totally devoted. He gathers what we now call intelligence data from his espionage network which extends throughout Europe and even goes after important information himself, when necessary. He also serves as a high-level diplomat as when he meets with the warrior-wonderwoman, Mary of Guise (Fanny Ardent), and assassinates her after sharing her bed. The French troops are thereby denied their leader as they await orders on the Scottish border. Walsingham is also a master of the slit throat (however young it may be) and of torture (even of Papal emissaries) if such initiatives serve the queen's purposes. In fact, her purposes ARE his purposes. We know that he served as her secretary of state from 1773 until 1590, was a member of the privy council, and knighted in recognition of brilliant and loyal service to her.To me, the younger Elizabeth's lover Robert Dudley symbolizes the personal life which she finally and completely renounces. An indifferent husband and father as well as a minor court figure, the character of Dudley in this film offers Fiennes little to work with but he does his best. The Duke of Norfolk and the French Duc d'Anjou (Vincent Cassell) are much more interesting characters, primarily because the former poses the most serious threat to Elizabeth and the latter provides some delightful comic relief. As entertaining this film is at times, however, I still view it as a generally dark study of a very dangerous period in English history when so many wars (declared or not) were in progress or imminent at the same time. With substantial dramatic impact, it reveals how and why England's survival literally depended on someone who eventually proved to be a much greater leader than her father, Henry VIII.",5,Glorious Drama,1059264000,"07 27, 2003",2003,3546,"['Briefly', 'here', 'historical', 'context', 'Elizabeth', '1533-1603', 'was', 'queen', 'England', 'Ireland', '1558', '1603', 'brief', 'reign', 'brother', 'Edward', 'VI', 'Elizabeth', 'barely', 'survived', 'especially', '1549', 'when', 'household', 'were', 'arrested', 'was', 'placed', 'what', 'now', 'call', 'protective', 'custody', 'November', '17', '1558', 'when', 'half-sister', 'Mary', 'died', 'Elizabeth', 'succeeded', 'throne', 'One', 'first', 'actions', 'queen', 'was', 'appoint', 'Sir', 'William', 'Cecil', 'later', 'Lord', 'Burghley', 'chief', 'secretary', 'continued', 'closest', 'adviser', 'were', 'aware', 'England', 'vulnerability', 'France', 'Spain', 'Both', 'also', 'knew', 'key', 'England', 'success', 'lay', 'playing', 'two', 'great', 'powers', 'other', 'so', 'could', 'bring', 'full', 'force', 'bear', 'England', 'defeat', 'Spanish', 'Armada', '1588', 'eliminated', 'one', 'serious', 'threat', 'England', 'security', 'also', 'created', 'almost', 'unlimited', 'opportunities', 'exploration', 'settlement', 'economic', 'growth', 'When', 'Elizabeth', 'died', '1603', 'Britannia', 'really', 'was', 'queen', 'oceans', 'Directed', 'Shekhar', 'Kapur', 'starring', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'film', 'Elizabeth', 'gradual', 'transformation', 'being', 'free-spirited', 'lusty', 'times', 'reckless', 'often', 'silly', 'young', 'princess', 'becoming', 'sanitized', 'somber', 'worldly-wise', 'monarch', 'Several', 'key', 'figures', 'are', 'centrally', 'involved', 'process', 'notably', 'Mary', 'Kathy', 'Burke', 'Cecil', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Duke', 'Norfolk', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'especially', 'Sir', 'Francis', 'Walsingham', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'adult', 'years', 'especially', 'when', 'protected', 'Walsingham', 'Elizabeth', 'survived', 'numerous', 'assassination', 'attempts', 'died', 'natural', 'causes', '1603.For', 'Walsingham', 'least', 'interesting', 'film', 'queen', 'whom', 'totally', 'devoted', 'what', 'now', 'call', 'intelligence', 'data', 'espionage', 'network', 'Europe', 'even', 'important', 'information', 'when', 'necessary', 'also', 'high-level', 'diplomat', 'when', 'warrior-wonderwoman', 'Mary', 'Guise', 'Fanny', 'Ardent', 'sharing', 'bed', 'French', 'troops', 'are', 'thereby', 'denied', 'leader', 'await', 'orders', 'Scottish', 'border', 'Walsingham', 'also', 'master', 'slit', 'throat', 'however', 'young', 'may', 'be', 'torture', 'even', 'Papal', 'emissaries', 'such', 'initiatives', 'serve', 'queen', 'purposes', 'fact', 'purposes', 'ARE', 'purposes', 'know', 'served', 'secretary', 'state', '1773', '1590', 'was', 'member', 'privy', 'council', 'knighted', 'recognition', 'brilliant', 'loyal', 'service', 'her.To', 'younger', 'Elizabeth', 'lover', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'personal', 'life', 'finally', 'completely', 'renounces', 'indifferent', 'husband', 'father', 'as', 'well', 'minor', 'court', 'figure', 'character', 'Dudley', 'film', 'Fiennes', 'little', 'work', 'best', 'Duke', 'Norfolk', 'French', 'Duc', ""d'Anjou"", 'Vincent', 'Cassell', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'characters', 'primarily', 'former', 'most', 'serious', 'threat', 'Elizabeth', 'latter', 'delightful', 'comic', 'relief', 'entertaining', 'film', 'times', 'however', 'still', 'view', 'generally', 'dark', 'study', 'very', 'dangerous', 'period', 'English', 'history', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'wars', 'declared', 'not', 'were', 'progress', 'imminent', 'same', 'time', 'substantial', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'how', 'why', 'England', 'survival', 'literally', 'depended', 'someone', 'who', 'eventually', 'proved', 'be', 'much', 'greater', 'leader', 'father', 'Henry', 'VIII']",N/A

461177,A2E1QZ5YSHVQXL,6305358567,Rocky,"[6, 10]","I loved this movie. Cate Blanchett played a marvelous Elizabeth, almost looked exactly like her as well. She has the right accent and even the right attitude to play the Virgin Queen. Strength was a bright aura around Cate throughout the entire film as well as the famous quick- thinking the Queen always was reported of having. Although there was a few places artistic license was stamped, it was almost the exact way things happened to the Virgin Queen, I know because I did a whole report on her a year ago in school. The only place they did a real doozy on was this passionate bond between the Duke and Elizabeth. See, back then, many believed that the Queen and the Duke had this affair going on, but it was never proven to be true. So I guess the movie took it as a good pathway for a little romance in the movie and made this a lovey- dovey part of the story. But really this is the only place they put heavy artistic license on.This movie is passionate and bold, showing how a woman ruled England in the most harshest times for women to even own their own household much less an entire country. Cate illuminated the Virgin Queen perfectly in both her strong moments and in her unsure times, telling the story of a princess shut out of society and then ultimately being thrown into royalty after her sister dies. The main problem they show clearly in this film is not her being a woman, although that's what you would assume, but it's actually becuase of religion. Due to the fact Mary, her sister who ruled before her was Catholic, the England was ran through this religion. But now Elizabeth is Protestant, and like in real life, she refused as she ascended the throne to change her belief. She also refuses as in real life throughout the movie to get married, claiming at the end of the movie that she was married- to her country of England.This film is above all a great biography of Elizabeth. It shows the passion, strength, courage, pride and tender heart of Elizabeth. This film is a must see and I rcommend it to all alike.

She presided over the transformation of Britain (England, really) from a poor backward country into perhaps the richest nation in the world.  As an American less familiar with English history than my British cousins, I cannot speak to the various historical inaccuracies that other reviewers have noted here.  But this film is a lavish spectacle that acquaints the viewer with the early portion of Elizabeth's reign and rule.  The central theme is her deft manipulation of stronger nations in favor of England by her tactic of dangling the possibility of a royal marriage in front of them.  This film gives the viewer a feel for what Elizabeth might have been like, and her political attitudes including her disdain for religious strife, i.e. Catholic versus Protestant.  Elizabeth's attitude towards marriage is summed up in the film by her icy announcement that she was ""married to England.""  And so she was.This is an engrossing and enjoyable film.

To me the deffinitive portraits on video were done with Glenda Jackson back in the early 1970s on BBC.  The acting and attention to detail were supurb.  Compared to that a movie like this comes off second or third place.This film suffers from being over done.  While Cate Blanchatte is fetching, she alone is not enough to carry a very heavy-handed production.  Because of the number of events that are being condensed into a two hour production the end result is the usual montage of MTV like images that flash onto the screen.  This seems to be a popular filming techneque now.  Flood the viewer with a collage of images all at once so they can't think about the actual content of the film.  Add to that over-powering music, much of not period I might add, and you complete the current package for today.  A confused mess!  Add to this that many if the actors look and act too comtemporary.  We have not even gott'en into the historical inaccuracies yet!  They are many and have been covered by other reviewers.  I would also say that the murder of Mary of Guise is wrong, and the use of Norfolk to represent all the evil Catholics in England at the time is over-simplification. The actor who plays him is terrible.  He is like some punk rocker stuffed into tights!The film has many other problems but I shall not list them.  I think the problem lies with the East Indian producer/director who does not know how to handle English history.The recent addition Elizabeth, The Golden Age that just came out suffers from many of the same issues above, but the storyline and events are presented in somewhat clearer fashion.

461183,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6305358567,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 2]","This baroque offering tells the tale of how the embattled Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) - a Protestant princess in a catholic court - rose to become the queen of England in name and deed.  The story opens with the impending death of Mary, Elizabeth's Catholic half-sister and the reigning ruler of England. Religious persecution of Protestants includes burning at the stake - an horrific display at the story's start.  Unable to stave death or produce an heir, Mary paves the way for her half-sister's ascension - even as she condemns Elizabeth as a bastard.  Crowned queen, Elizabeth is hardly secure in her position.  With Catholicism dominant, English Bishops side with Rome, Spain and France against her, undermining her authority and preaching against those who would rise to her defense.  Outwardly, they urge her marriage to any one of several suitable suitors - foreign born Spanish or French princes.  On her side, Elizabeth's resources are meager - the kindly but ineffectual Sir William Cecil (Richard Attenborough) , the passionate (perhaps too passionate) Sir Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes) and Sir Francis Walsingham (Jeffrey Rush, helping make this look like a ""Shakespeare in Love"" reunion) as Elizabeth's warrior-assassin.  With Papal intrigues linking Rome to the insidious Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston), and a military threat posed by the formidable French war-mistress Mary of Guise (Fanny Ardant), Elizabeth's tenure seems doomed from the moment of her coronation.  Instead, her headstrong resolve (and Walsingham's clever moves) secure her until she can consolidate her rule.  By the end of the film, already the target of numerous barely botched assassination attempts, Elizabeth emerges corseted and whitened, a virtual living ghost who held the throne for the sake of England but lost out on love and her own security.This is a great film, but mostly because of Cate Blanchett, who seems regal even when (especially the early part of the flick) when it's clear she doesn't know what she's doing.  She can be funny (telling the Bishops that it doesn't matter which suitor of France or Spain is superior - she'll simply marry both), but never above letting everybody know who wears the crown. Jeff Rush is also great as her Elizabethan-era mentat.  The story however is weak - it seems that Walsingham manages to do what he can because, despite his notoriety, there seems no shortage of victims willing to let him come close enough for the kill.  Elizabeth's consolidation itself culminates in a purge of Catholic subversives led by Norfolk, but that requires some explanation because such a purge would require the sort of substantial support that Elizabeth clearly lacked.  The relationship between Walsingham and the Queen is also understated, possibly because it would complicate Elizabeth's relationship with Dudley.  Still Blanchett carries the film, helped by excellent cinematography which creates an England shrouded in gloom.",4,Regal Drama,1008288000,"12 14, 2001",2001,2965,"['baroque', 'offering', 'tale', 'how', 'embattled', 'Elizabeth', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Protestant', 'princess', 'catholic', 'court', 'rose', 'become', 'queen', 'England', 'name', 'deed', 'story', 'impending', 'death', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Catholic', 'half-sister', 'reigning', 'ruler', 'England', 'Religious', 'persecution', 'Protestants', 'burning', 'stake', 'horrific', 'display', 'story', 'start', 'Unable', 'stave', 'death', 'produce', 'heir', 'Mary', 'way', 'half-sister', 'ascension', 'even', 'Elizabeth', 'bastard', 'Crowned', 'queen', 'Elizabeth', 'hardly', 'secure', 'position', 'Catholicism', 'dominant', 'English', 'Bishops', 'side', 'Rome', 'Spain', 'France', 'undermining', 'authority', 'preaching', 'who', 'would', 'rise', 'defense', 'Outwardly', 'urge', 'marriage', 'one', 'several', 'suitable', 'suitors', 'foreign', 'born', 'Spanish', 'French', 'princes', 'side', 'Elizabeth', 'resources', 'are', 'meager', 'kindly', 'ineffectual', 'Sir', 'William', 'Cecil', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'passionate', 'perhaps', 'too', 'passionate', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Sir', 'Francis', 'Walsingham', 'Jeffrey', 'Rush', 'helping', 'make', 'look', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'reunion', 'Elizabeth', 'warrior-assassin', 'Papal', 'intrigues', 'linking', 'Rome', 'insidious', 'Duke', 'Norfolk', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'military', 'threat', 'posed', 'formidable', 'French', 'war-mistress', 'Mary', 'Guise', 'Fanny', 'Ardant', 'Elizabeth', 'tenure', 'doomed', 'moment', 'coronation', 'Instead', 'headstrong', 'resolve', 'Walsingham', 'clever', 'moves', 'secure', 'can', 'consolidate', 'rule', 'end', 'film', 'already', 'target', 'numerous', 'barely', 'botched', 'assassination', 'attempts', 'Elizabeth', 'corseted', 'whitened', 'virtual', 'living', 'ghost', 'who', 'held', 'throne', 'sake', 'England', 'lost', 'out', 'love', 'own', 'security.This', 'great', 'film', 'mostly', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'who', 'regal', 'even', 'when', 'especially', 'early', 'part', 'flick', 'when', 'clear', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'doing', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'telling', 'Bishops', ""n't"", 'matter', 'suitor', 'France', 'Spain', 'superior', ""'ll"", 'simply', 'marry', 'never', 'letting', 'everybody', 'know', 'who', 'crown', 'Jeff', 'Rush', 'also', 'great', 'Elizabethan-era', 'mentat', 'story', 'however', 'weak', 'Walsingham', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'because', 'notoriety', 'shortage', 'victims', 'willing', 'let', 'come', 'close', 'enough', 'kill', 'Elizabeth', 'consolidation', 'purge', 'Catholic', 'subversives', 'led', 'Norfolk', 'explanation', 'purge', 'would', 'require', 'sort', 'substantial', 'support', 'Elizabeth', 'clearly', 'lacked', 'relationship', 'Walsingham', 'Queen', 'also', 'understated', 'possibly', 'would', 'complicate', 'Elizabeth', 'relationship', 'Dudley', 'Still', 'Blanchett', 'film', 'helped', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'England', 'shrouded', 'gloom']",N/A

There is so much to be said for this movie. In today's techno world, where even some Shakespeare movies have given way to Hollywood, this is a masterfully done movie that relies on character development, a superb script, and beautiful scenery as opposed to effects. The movie grabs our attention right away with Bloody Mary's psychotic and ill use of power. Soon afterwards, we see Elizabeth's dangerous state. When Elizabeth survives her half sister and becomes queen, she sees that the game has only just started. She is faced with several decisions regarding her personal state as well as the state of England. One truth this movie reveals is that whatever the faults of her father King Henry VIII were, he was a strong and able king for those hard times. Many people seem to overlook the facts that King Henry VIII (1) Furthered constitutional governing, (2) Authorized the Bible's translation into English, (3) Built up England's navy very well, (4) Kept order in a hard time without any wars resulting, and (5) Satisfied Parliament by removing England from Rome's grip. (When he is spoken of, he is spoken of well.)It may help us to appreciate this movie more if we remember that Elizabeth's grandfather King Henry VII ended The War of the Roses; her father King Henry VIII, pulled England through the Reformation. And Bloody Mary quite undid the fine work of her father and grandfather. And it was up to Elizabeth to fix this. Another thing I must say about this movie is that the violent scenes are done well. Many movies tend to glorify in violence, and to make it worse, they add low humor at the so called 'bad guys' expense. THIS IS NOT THE CASE HERE AT ALL! In this movie, it is clear that the violence is quite forced. It is not delighted in, and there is no low humor involved. Also, our attention is well kept between Elizabeth's personal emotional struggles as well as her struggles to restore England to the state her father and grandfather did. It is very tragic that the simplistic &quot;Shrek,&quot; special effects Sci Fi, low humor, no story action movies, or simplistic bood and guts movies tend to dominate the market.

This film pulls you in from beginning to end.  Cate Blanchett at Elizabeth I is simply ingenius casting.  Elizabeth has been portrayed in so many other films by marvelous actresses in their later years that we seem to have a picture of a rather stiff and cartoonish type monarch when we think of Elizabeth.  Cate dispels this image from the start.  The story begins prior to Elizabeth's accession to the throne and the harsh treatment she bore from her sister Mary.  As Elizabeth's mother, Anne Boleyn, caused the banishment of Mary and her mother Catherine of Aragon, it is easy to see why Mary feels threatened by this young girl.  Elizabeth barely makes it through the later years of Mary's reign with her head.Joseph Fiennes does a marvelous job of playing Robert Dudley.  The Queen's Master of the Horse, and as many historians believe, her lover.  The love story is entertainingly expanded upon as well as the various plots against Elizabeth's life by catholic followers.  Elizabeth's flirting way of holding her privy counsel at bay on the issue of marriage are in excellent evidence here.  She bravely proclaims ""There will be one Mistress here and NO Master!""  The fifth star is only withheld here for historical innaccuracy, but it in no way hampers the flow or entertainment value of this lavish and lovely film.  Cate deserved the Academy Award for this.  Her performance far surpasses Gwyneth Paltrow's in Shakespeare in Love, which is who she lost to that year.

The delight of unrequited infatuations!As though all that's not enough, the film packs a full punch of conspiracies, intrigue, wars without battles, trust, betrayal, religious tirades.Critics lament that it doesn't do justice to history. Well, historical context is seldom a breeze so if you read too much into Elizabeth's rocky childhood (Henry the 8th, her father, was emotionally/sexually quite a convoluted man) then the film seems sparse on intricate detail and its possible effects on the young queen's psyche. Of course.If on the other hand you are willing to forgive the director's decision to refrain from condensing 20 chequered adoloscent years into a 2 hour narrative, and focusing instead on the period of her thorny ascent to the biggest throne of the world in her time, a time when she also fell in love, then this nearly flawless production is a DVD that deserves a proud seat in your collection.",5,TERRIFIC POLITICAL THRILLER WITH VISUALS TO DROOL AT,1092700800,"08 17, 2004",2004,1563,"['Everytime', 'come', 'movie', 'fall', 'prey', 'end', 'up', 'sitting', 'right', 'end', 'One', 'would', 'imagine', ""'d"", 'jade', 'bit', 'fifth', 'time', 'one', 'watched', 'nope.First', 'thing', 'up', 'fascinating', 'lighting', 'camera', 'perfectly', 'complement', 'Darkly', 'lit', 'shots', 'glorious', 'British', 'castles', 'Impulsive', 'burst', 'royal', 'dances', 'Mesmerizing.Next', 'grand', 'costumes', 'Not', 'just', 'grand', 'fact', 'gorgeously', 'color', 'coordinated', 'suspect', 'use', 'shots', 'film', 'fashion', 'design', 'courses.Then', 'undercurrent', 'seductive', 'romance', 'Blanchett', 'Fiennes', 'practically', 'screen', 'Much', 'unsaid', 'lot', 'undone', 'delight', 'unrequited', 'infatuations', 'not', 'enough', 'film', 'full', 'punch', 'conspiracies', 'intrigue', 'wars', 'battles', 'trust', 'betrayal', 'religious', 'tirades.Critics', 'lament', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'history', 'Well', 'historical', 'context', 'seldom', 'breeze', 'so', 'read', 'too', 'much', 'Elizabeth', 'rocky', 'childhood', 'Henry', '8th', 'father', 'was', 'emotionally/sexually', 'quite', 'convoluted', 'man', 'then', 'film', 'sparse', 'intricate', 'detail', 'possible', 'effects', 'young', 'queen', 'psyche', 'course.If', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'willing', 'forgive', 'director', 'decision', 'refrain', 'condensing', '20', 'chequered', 'adoloscent', 'years', '2', 'hour', 'narrative', 'focusing', 'instead', 'period', 'thorny', 'ascent', 'biggest', 'throne', 'world', 'time', 'time', 'when', 'also', 'fell', 'love', 'then', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'production', 'DVD', 'proud', 'seat', 'collection']",N/A

Cate Blanchet earned a much-deserved Oscar nomination for best actress for her portrayal of England's most famous Matriarch, Elizabeth I.The movie gives insights  into what was going on with Elizabeth's half-sister, Mary Queen of Scots  and her apparent dementia resulting from multiple tumors and probably a  touch of syphillis to boot. The persecution of Protestants under the reign  of  the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots plainly shows what a harsh time this  was and how much danger Elizabeth was in when it was clear that her sister  had not produced an heir to the throne and her death was imminent.The  acting and scenery are breath-taking and you quickly forget you're watching  a movie, but feel like you're right there as an observer in time, watching  historical events unfold.The movie is riddled with brute violence, but  not violence for its own sake. Likewise, there is nudity and at least one  sex scene that leaves nothing to the imagination... so this is not for  young viewers. Nevertheless, this is a spectacular piece of  filmmaking.You get a deeper respect and awe for the historical person of  Elizabeth, realizing what she overcame despite being a woman in a time when  women were only accessories to men. A true leader and a queen passionate  about her very important role - not satisfied with sitting on her laurels  and just enjoying royal treatment... she was fervently involved in all  aspects of government and was probably driven to be so involved due to the  volitile time in which she reigned.I'm not a history buff, but I loved  this film. The DVD is splendid and includes trailers, behind the scenes  footage, cast bios and a featurette about the film.  The menus on the DVD  are in the same caliber as the film itself. If you're going to get this  film, this is the format in which to view it.  This is the type of film of  which other films of this genre can be measured against.

Although historically inaccurate, Kapur's Elizabeth is a masterpiece of cinematography.  Cate Blanchett, a virtual unknown when she was cast for the role, couldn't have been a better choice for the role of this ageless monarch.The film covers approximately five years of Elizabeth's reign, from her life as a Princess, to her ascendancy to the throne on 17 November 1558 to her maturing as a monarch, taking the reigns of power from advisors.  Again, ignoring the fact that some events in the film are not accurate (Kapur explains this in the bonus features), Elizabeth is a fantastic portrayal of the Tudor dynasty that died with Elizabeth I.  Joseph Fiennes was the perfect choice for the Earl of Leicester (whom Elizabeth called ""My Eyes""), as Fiennes is a well known Shakespearean actor, who portrayed Shakespeare the same year Elizabeth came out in ""Shakespeare in Love"".Great cast, including Geoffrey Rush and Sir Richard Attenborough, Elizabeth is a feast of photography, words, history and acting.

Certainly acknowledged by the Oscars garnering 7 nominations,  Shekhar Kapur's intimate portrait of a young Elizabeth further expands the  modern view on a distant monarch, whose maturing reign as well as taming  nature continued to dazzle the 20th century viewers.Presented here by  a superb cast led by Golden-Globe winner Cate Blanchett, early Elizabethean  era turmoil and upheavel are captured brilliantly. The lush set itself is a  feast for the eye as the audience is drawn to follow a passionate young  Elizabeth's path.  Against the dark setting of middleval stone castles, a  blooming Golden Age approahces as England expands to take control in a  world of great unrest after Catholic Queen Mary's death.  Her Protestant  half-sister, Elizabeth daughter of Anne Bolyne is placed on a throne of a  kingdom torn between religion.  Cate Blanchett does a fabulous job  capturing the details of a frustrated young woman waking to the merciless  reality of queenhood--surrounded by enemies such as Norfolk (Christopher  Eccleston).  Constantly by her side is her reverent adviser Sir William  Cecil (Richard Attenborough) who advices Elizabeth to marry for convenience  choosing a &quot;pool&quot; of ready political candidates--while Elizabeth  herself is long set on her lover from the past Sir Robert Dudley (a  charming Joseph Fiennes).  Yet just as England learns to wake up from the  mideval dream, Elizabeth learns the bittnerness of betrayal as she looks to  Sir Francis Walsingham (Jeffrey Rush)'s counsel.Focusing on Elizabeth's  subtle changes of phase from fire to ice at a distant in the midst of a  grander panaroma beautifully shot, the audience gradually distinguishes her  footsteps from the shedding of innocence to a tough ruler that dares to  strike first agaisnt her enemies, to ultimately become the Virgin Queen to  reign above all men.",5,The Making of a Queen: tamed passion,950918400,"02 19, 2000",2000,2015,"['year', 'overwhelmed', 'reminiscent', 'films', 'Elizabeth', 'rest', 'become', 'one', 'few', 'stunning', 'manifestations', 'Hollywood', 'Renaissance', 'Certainly', 'acknowledged', 'Oscars', 'garnering', '7', 'nominations', 'Shekhar', 'Kapur', 'intimate', 'portrait', 'young', 'Elizabeth', 'further', 'modern', 'view', 'distant', 'monarch', 'maturing', 'reign', 'as', 'well', 'taming', 'nature', 'continued', 'dazzle', '20th', 'century', 'viewers.Presented', 'here', 'superb', 'cast', 'led', 'Golden-Globe', 'winner', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'early', 'Elizabethean', 'era', 'turmoil', 'upheavel', 'are', 'captured', 'brilliantly', 'lush', 'set', 'feast', 'eye', 'audience', 'drawn', 'follow', 'passionate', 'young', 'Elizabeth', 'path', 'dark', 'setting', 'middleval', 'stone', 'castles', 'blooming', 'Golden', 'Age', 'England', 'take', 'control', 'world', 'great', 'unrest', 'Catholic', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'death', 'Protestant', 'half-sister', 'Elizabeth', 'daughter', 'Anne', 'Bolyne', 'placed', 'throne', 'kingdom', 'torn', 'religion', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'fabulous', 'job', 'capturing', 'details', 'frustrated', 'young', 'woman', 'waking', 'merciless', 'reality', 'queenhood', 'surrounded', 'enemies', 'such', 'Norfolk', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'Constantly', 'side', 'reverent', 'adviser', 'Sir', 'William', 'Cecil', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'who', 'Elizabeth', 'marry', 'convenience', 'choosing', 'quot', 'pool', 'quot', 'ready', 'political', 'candidates', 'Elizabeth', 'long', 'set', 'lover', 'past', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'charming', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Yet', 'just', 'England', 'wake', 'up', 'mideval', 'dream', 'Elizabeth', 'bittnerness', 'betrayal', 'Sir', 'Francis', 'Walsingham', 'Jeffrey', 'Rush', 'counsel.Focusing', 'Elizabeth', 'subtle', 'changes', 'phase', 'fire', 'ice', 'distant', 'midst', 'grander', 'panaroma', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'audience', 'gradually', 'footsteps', 'shedding', 'innocence', 'tough', 'ruler', 'strike', 'first', 'enemies', 'ultimately', 'become', 'Virgin', 'Queen', 'reign', 'men']",N/A

If you're looking for a movie with all the intrigue of a good Mafia flick and a lead character as fascinating as Elizabeth Bennett in PRIDE &amp; PREJUDICE, see this film!  I've had to go back for several viewings, and I'm as enthusiastic as ever about Cate Blanchett, the script, the cast, the art direction -- everything about this movie just plain works. I think you may find it irresistible.Cate Blanchett is truly amazing.  A virtual unknown when Kapur selected her for this film, Cate owns the role all the way from the naturally beautiful, frolicking young Princess to the awe-inspiring, white-pancaked visage of the Virgin Queen.  Her expressive face is very easy to watch in all her moods.I'm not comfortable with the term &quot;fictionalized&quot; when applied to this movie because the intent here is not to rewrite or depart from history at all.  In fact, this is a very convincing effort to deduce the methods and manner by which Elizabeth evolved to her ultimate power and glory.  I think they've done a spectacular job of connecting the dots and giving us, at least impressionistically, a look at the likely forces at work.Again, this is not a costume pageant.  It's young and vital and suspenseful and very engaging.  The movie is lush and beautiful, but the film is all about human beings, motivations, machinations and the stream of life.  Blanchett carries the film along with ease, even in its most difficult passages, and is framed by a great cast as well.  Standouts for me included Jeffrey Rush as loyal facilitator and protector Walsingham, Kathy Burke as Cate's dying sister Queen Mary -- who worries that Cate will champion Protestantism but admirably refuses to execute her own sister without cause -- and the exotically beautiful Fanny Ardant as the conniving and bloody Mary de Guise.I had to watch the film more than once to fully realize the point that this film makes regarding Elizabeth's re-invention of herself as the 'Virgin Queen' -- she did have a boyfriend, after all.  The dialog toward the end is quite persuasive in this regard, as events force Elizabeth to the conclusion that, as monarch of the people, male companionship can only bring weakness to her country, and so she marries England just as a nun marries the church -- for good (at least, in public).ELIZABETH is a joy of a movie and I am glad to have it in my DVD collection -- a fine job of rendering by the way and some nice extra featurettes.  Mainly, it is a Cate Blanchett tour de force which establishes her as a major star, but it is also a triumph of the British cinema and an instant classic -- in fact I enjoyed this movie far more than the other period film released at the same time, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.  Blanchett in ELIZABETH is a different cup of tea, and much more to my taste.  If you have any remaining doubts about seeing this movie after all the stellar reviews herein, I urge you to take the plunge and find out what everyone is raving about.

Shekhar Kapur has taken a personality that has fascinated historians and writers since the 16th century, and turned it into an mush that portrays Elizabeth I as weak, vacillating, and completely dependent on her counselors for guidance.That is not to say there is not good in this film -- Cate Blanchett gives a compelling performance despite a highly flawed script, well worth the Oscar nomination she received.  Geoffrey Rush as Francis Walsingham is cold, calculating, and absolutely determined to pursue the path he feels is best for England and his queen without a thought to the consequences for those around him.Other actors do not fair so well, however.

The result is a stunning spectacle of Elizabethan life and politics that simplifies and sometimes deviates from history, but is never dull. For example, Mary of Guise, Regent of Scotland and mother of Elizabeth's nemesis, Mary Queen of Scots, was not seduced and killed by Walsingham. She died of dropsy. Of course, showing the grotesquely swollen body of someone with dropsy would have had a very different cinematic  effect than the sight of slender and lovely Fanny Ardant. And William Cecil was not retired by the young Elizabeth so she could run her own affairs. He was only 38 at Elizabeth's coronation (unlike the octogenarian actor who portrays him in the film) and continued to be her most trusted adviser on the privy council for 40 years until he died, and was succeeded by his son, Robert Cecil.But perhaps the greatest deviation of the film from history is its portrayal of Elizabeth's favorite, Robert Dudley, as a shallow boy toy. The real Robert Dudley was tall and athletic and an expert jouster. His main attraction for Elizabeth, however, was his mind. Like Elizabeth, he had a classical education, and was fluent in French and Italian. But he also studied science and mathematics, was a brilliant conversationalist, and (most important) could make her laugh. In the HBO miniseries, Elizabeth I, Jeremy Irons portrays Robert Dudley and his relations with Elizabeth (played by Helen Mirren) much more accurately. Good as the miniseries is, though, one can't help thinking that sometimes Shekar's film (in the spirit of Thucidides) shows us what people should have said and done (rather than what they actually said and did), because it would have made better drama.",5,Grand historical fiction,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,1827,"['Shekar', 'Elizabeth', 'many', 'years', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'reign', 'apparently', 'short', 'time', 'events', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'result', 'stunning', 'spectacle', 'Elizabethan', 'life', 'politics', 'simplifies', 'sometimes', 'deviates', 'history', 'never', 'dull', 'example', 'Mary', 'Guise', 'Regent', 'Scotland', 'mother', 'Elizabeth', 'nemesis', 'Mary', 'Queen', 'Scots', 'was', 'not', 'seduced', 'killed', 'Walsingham', 'died', 'dropsy', 'course', 'showing', 'grotesquely', 'swollen', 'body', 'someone', 'dropsy', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'very', 'different', 'cinematic', 'effect', 'sight', 'slender', 'lovely', 'Fanny', 'Ardant', 'William', 'Cecil', 'was', 'not', 'retired', 'young', 'Elizabeth', 'could', 'run', 'own', 'affairs', 'was', 'only', '38', 'Elizabeth', 'coronation', 'octogenarian', 'actor', 'who', 'film', 'continued', 'be', 'most', 'trusted', 'adviser', 'privy', 'council', '40', 'years', 'died', 'was', 'succeeded', 'son', 'Robert', 'Cecil.But', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'deviation', 'film', 'history', 'portrayal', 'Elizabeth', 'favorite', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'shallow', 'boy', 'toy', 'real', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'was', 'tall', 'athletic', 'expert', 'jouster', 'main', 'attraction', 'Elizabeth', 'however', 'was', 'mind', 'Elizabeth', 'had', 'classical', 'education', 'was', 'fluent', 'French', 'Italian', 'also', 'studied', 'science', 'mathematics', 'was', 'brilliant', 'conversationalist', 'most', 'important', 'could', 'make', 'laugh', 'HBO', 'miniseries', 'Elizabeth', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'relations', 'Elizabeth', 'played', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'much', 'more', 'accurately', 'Good', 'miniseries', 'though', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'Shekar', 'film', 'spirit', 'Thucidides', 'people', 'should', 'have', 'said', 'done', 'rather', 'what', 'actually', 'said', 'did', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'drama']",N/A

This film is lovingly directed.  The director let's the plot and the actors actually tell the story in a fashion that is unobtrusive.5.

The problems are... well.... endless, but I will only mention two or three:1) Elizabeth knows that Robert Dudley is married long before she comes to the throne. The crisis in their relationship comes early in her reign when Dudley's wife dies under mysterious circumstances. Although the death is ruled an accident, many still suspect Dudley (and Elizabeth). This is the main event that effectively prevents them from ever marrying. The fact that almost nobody liked Dudley (except, it seems, Elizabeth) is another.2) Sir William Cecil is older than Elizabeth but only 12 or so years.  He's not her grandfather's age - as Richard Attenborough looks. Cecil becomes Lord Burghley as a result of Elizabeth's favor, but the movie says she rewards him for his service - as she removes him from office. In reality, she never let him retire from her service, much as he begged as he grew old and infirm.3) Cat Ashley, Elizabeth's companion and friend, was in fact much older than Elizabeth, not of the same age group as this movie shows.

461211,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,6305358567,Themis-Athena,"[126, 149]","Among Great Britain's monarchs, two queens stand out in particular: Elizabeth I. and Queen Victoria. Both came to power at extremely young ages, and at times of political instability which would have set the odds of survival against any new ruler, but particularly so, against a woman. Both beat those odds in ways few people would have foreseen: They not only persevered but ruled for a nearly unparalleled long time, and during their reign achieved to both strengthen England's economy and international stance and give new direction to its society. We have long come to identify their reign as ""the Victorian Age"" and ""the Elizabethan Age,"" respectively. Yet, while ""Victorian England"" is an expression often used synonymously with moral conservativism, Elizabeth I. fostered not only the development of science but also the theater and arts; providing fertile ground for the works of Shakespeare, Marlowe and many others. (Influenced by her husband, Queen Victoria supported the exploration of new scientific developments, but the dominant force of her formative years as a ruler was conservative prime minister Lord Melbourne, who once advised her not to read Dickens because his books were ""full of unpleasant subjects."") And while Queen Victoria derived strength from her long, stable marriage to German-born Prince Albert, Elizabeth I. resisted the pressure to marry at all and became known as ""the Virgin Queen.""Looking back at Elizabeth's reign, we see less a woman than an icon; the symbol of what her rule has come to stand for. Shekhar Kapur's 1998 movie explores, as the director explains in the DVD's ""Making of"" feature, the making of that icon; the formative processes, influences and personalities surrounding the young princess's ascent to the throne and her first years in power - and of course, at the center of it all, Elizabeth herself, magnificently portrayed by Cate Blanchett (who should have won the Academy Award for her performance). The princess, as this movie sees her, certainly knew her insecurities about her role in life and in English politics, her people's expectations, and the intrigues of her own court. But she was also, as Kapur has her affirm to her protector and spymaster Walsingham, ""[her] father's daughter"" - the proud, headstrong daughter of Henry VIII., who quickly learned from her mistakes and assumed true leadership early on. Having inherited a country deeply torn in religious conflict, and having barely survived the machinations of the court of her Catholic half sister and predecessor, ""Bloody"" Mary I., to find her, the ""heretic,"" guilty of treason and execute her, one of Elizabeth's first acts in power was to have parliament pass the Act of Uniformity, reestablishing the Church of England formed by her father. And while she respected her Secretary of State Sir William Cecil, she eventually came to realize that his advice was overly guided by the hope that she marry and produce an heir to secure her kingdom, and she reluctantly retired him into his status as Lord Burghley.Indeed, there was not one single man who dominated Elizabeth's life but several, and Kapur was able to secure an extraordinary cast to surround then-newcomer Blanchett. Richard Attenborough plays Sir William Cecil with a humility and quiet dignity that few besides him could have brought to the screen. Christopher Eccleston bristles as the powerful, ambitious Catholic Duke of Norfolk, that key player from the inner circle of Mary's court who retained his position after her death and became the one member of Elizabeth's council most dangerous to her reign. Joseph Fiennes reprises his role as a burning-eyed, handsome lover from the almost simultaneously released ""Shakespeare in Love"" (which, while a splendid movie in its own rights, eclipsed much of the limelight that ""Elizabeth"" would so richly have deserved), playing the man most closely romantically linked to Elizabeth, ""Sweet"" Lord Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, whose love for her - at least, as this movie would have it - is ultimately his own undoing. ""You're still my Elizabeth,"" the erstwhile princess's lover insists at a ball some time after her coronation. ""I am no man's Elizabeth,"" the queen retorts, and affirms for all the court to hear: ""I will have one mistress here, and no master!""Most impressive of all the queen's men is Geoffrey Rush's portrayal as her protector, secret advisor and supreme spymaster Francis Walsingham, the creator of what much later became Britain's MI-5, whose role Rush approached, inspired by the description Kapur had given him, much like the Hindu god Krishna, as ""a very wise man who can kill people ... while smiling,"" as he explains in the DVD's ""Making of"" featurette - an ability which his young, unfaithful companion in exile learns to know as much as powerful Marie de Guise (Fanny Ardant), aunt to Elizabeth's would-be suitor Henri d'Anjou and mother of her later rival Mary of Scots; who had refused Henry VIII.'s suit remarking ""I may be big in person, but my neck is small,"" only to find herself terminally surrendering to Walsingham's unmatched cunning.Key to any great historical movie is the authenticity of its production design, and ""Elizabeth"" overflows with the rich and luxurious colors of the queen's renaissance court and its balls, gowns and pageants. But there are also the vast, high stone halls of the palace and the royal cathedral, symbolizing the perpetuity of the monarchy reestablished by Elizabeth I. At last, when contemplating a statute of the Virgin Mary, Elizabeth wonders whether, to perpetuate her reign, she must be ""made of stone;"" and it is again Walsingham who answers: ""Aye, Madam, to reign supreme, [because] all men ... must be able to touch the divine here on earth"" and as yet, ""they have found nothing to replace [Mary]."" And so, this movie tells us, the icon we all know was created - and like a nun married to God, a dehumanized Elizabeth reenters her council and holds out her hand to her old Secretary of State:

The  villains are simply evil. The heroes are pretty nasty too, and Queen  Elizabeth is more of a woman who needs rescuing by men.Geoffrey Rush's  Walsingham is like Robert Deniro from teh Godfather movies but more so. YOu  think that everything he's doing is without Elizabeth's consent. Another  historical figure who was nominally loyal but had to be executed because he  was stupid enough to think that he could marry the imprisoned Mary, Queen  of Scots without consequence, is here portrayed as a snarling surly  Catholic who would do anything to get rid of teh protestant queen. Slightly  insulting is the scene in which Elizabeth is having trouble at the court  and she runs off to be alone and sees a picture of Henry VIII and decides  that she is her father's daughter after all. Her transformation from a  maiden to a matron with white make-up and wig (historically more due to  fashion and smallpox than a virgin mary complex) is kind of ridiculous.What's good about this movie is the acting. Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey  RUsh are amazing and while Joseph Fiennes is little more than window  dressing, the rest of the ministers have their ticks. The story is  intriguing and even though it patterns itself after the Godfather  (including a &quot;everyone gets killed at once while our hero is in a  religious setting&quot; scene) it did pattern itself after something  great.The main problems I have is that Queen Elizabeth from Shakespeare  in Love captured the queen more. This woman was considered &quot;the silly  queen&quot; because she would cultivate a dippy personae that kept her from  getting killed by her Catholic sister. SHe had some Catholics killed and  some Catholics wanted to kill her but she certainly wasn't trying to co-opt  Catholicism and she managed to neither swing too far to the protestant or  the Catholic side of the spectrum and England prospered because of her. She  could be a vain and petty woman surrounding herself with sycophants but she  still knew how to see through the games and intrigues and played her own  very well (especially the marriage game in which her goal was to be single  her life with an entire country expecting a king at any moment.)So great  movie on its own. THe only reason why I'm taking off a star is becase the  historical facts had so much more potential for storytelling than this  movie would suggest.If you are interested in other Elizabeth stuff read  Alison Weir's books includnig The Children of Henry VII which goes from  Henry VIII's death to Elizabeth's acension to the throne with all the court  intrigues swirling around her. It's one of the best books written about  English history.",4,History is dumbed down but that's to be expected,961027200,"06 15, 2000",2000,2962,"['Taking', 'complex', 'reign', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'woman', 'power', 'rested', 'being', 'underestimated', 'everyone', 'including', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'killed', 'knew', 'mind', 'turning', 'Godfather', 'ripoff', 'movie', 'bit', 'disservice', 'most', 'people', 'villains', 'are', 'simply', 'evil', 'heroes', 'are', 'pretty', 'nasty', 'too', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'more', 'woman', 'who', 'rescuing', 'men.Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Walsingham', 'Robert', 'Deniro', 'teh', 'Godfather', 'movies', 'more', 'so', 'think', 'everything', 'doing', 'Elizabeth', 'consent', 'historical', 'figure', 'who', 'was', 'nominally', 'loyal', 'had', 'be', 'executed', 'was', 'stupid', 'enough', 'think', 'could', 'marry', 'imprisoned', 'Mary', 'Queen', 'Scots', 'consequence', 'here', 'portrayed', 'snarling', 'surly', 'Catholic', 'who', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'rid', 'teh', 'protestant', 'queen', 'Slightly', 'insulting', 'scene', 'Elizabeth', 'having', 'trouble', 'court', 'be', 'alone', 'picture', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'father', 'daughter', 'transformation', 'maiden', 'matron', 'white', 'make-up', 'wig', 'historically', 'more', 'due', 'fashion', 'smallpox', 'virgin', 'mary', 'complex', 'kind', 'ridiculous.What', 'good', 'movie', 'acting', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Geoffrey', 'RUsh', 'are', 'amazing', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'little', 'more', 'window', 'dressing', 'rest', 'ministers', 'have', 'ticks', 'story', 'intriguing', 'even', 'Godfather', 'including', 'quot', 'everyone', 'killed', 'once', 'hero', 'religious', 'setting', 'quot', 'scene', 'did', 'pattern', 'something', 'great.The', 'main', 'problems', 'have', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'captured', 'queen', 'more', 'woman', 'was', 'considered', 'quot', 'silly', 'queen', 'quot', 'would', 'cultivate', 'dippy', 'personae', 'kept', 'getting', 'killed', 'Catholic', 'sister', 'SHe', 'had', 'Catholics', 'killed', 'Catholics', 'wanted', 'kill', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'trying', 'co-opt', 'Catholicism', 'managed', 'neither', 'swing', 'too', 'far', 'protestant', 'Catholic', 'side', 'spectrum', 'England', 'prospered', 'her', 'could', 'be', 'vain', 'petty', 'woman', 'surrounding', 'sycophants', 'still', 'knew', 'how', 'see', 'games', 'intrigues', 'played', 'own', 'very', 'well', 'especially', 'marriage', 'game', 'goal', 'was', 'be', 'single', 'life', 'entire', 'country', 'expecting', 'king', 'moment', 'So', 'great', 'movie', 'own', 'THe', 'only', 'reason', 'why', ""'m"", 'taking', 'off', 'star', 'historical', 'facts', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'potential', 'storytelling', 'movie', 'would', 'suggest.If', 'are', 'interested', 'other', 'Elizabeth', 'stuff', 'read', 'Alison', 'Weir', 'books', 'includnig', 'Children', 'Henry', 'VII', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'death', 'Elizabeth', 'acension', 'throne', 'court', 'swirling', 'one', 'best', 'books', 'written', 'English', 'history']",N/A

Over acting becomes a substitute for script and plot construction.Elizabeth by comparison is delightful if slightly grim at the beginning. It covers the last year of Mary Tudors reign and Elizabeth's succession to the throne. Mary historically was concerned about Elizabeth's succession. Mary was Henry the VIII's first wife and he had left her for Elizabeth's mother. In addition Elizabeth was seen as a person who was committed to the continuing split from Rome. Mary had tried to end the split.  The film deals with the question of whether Elizabeth will survive at all and then when she becomes Queen her fight to have meaningful authority. Geoffrey Rush is great as a highly fictitious intelligent agent.Kate Blanchett is brilliant in the title role. She portrays well the initial trust that she has with her courtiers something which gradually changes to a steely hardness. She deserved an Oscar for the performance.

The best part is that we see the young Elizabeth: passionate,  vulnerable, and most of all, human.  Under threat of death by her own  sister, caught up in the English Counter-Reformation of the mid-1500's, and  facing love and marriage issues that would challenge man or woman,  Elizabeth at the end of the film chooses the only path open to her to  secure her throne: to transcend humanity and become an icon...or as to  paraphrase Elizabeth herself, &quot;to be a reborn Virgin&quot;.  The last  scene in the film encapsulates it, as Elizabeth transforms herself with  chalk-white makeup, a bright red wig, and a spectacular out-of-this-world  costume.  I do have some minor quibbles with the implied dates: the film  gives you the impression that Mary Tudor, Elizabeth's sister, dies in the  mid-1550s, when in reality it was 1558; also, the film doesn't emphasize  her intellectual brilliance as much as it should (and was historically  mentioned by everyone who met her).

461219,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6305358567,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","Partially reinventing the period movie, stylistically at least, almost as radically as Martin Scorsese reinvented the Biblical epic with his Last Temptation, Shekhur Kapur's account of the insecure early days of Elizabeth I's reign, Elizabeth, is a claustrophobic film set in a dark world of cold grey stone, alternating overhead shots with tight medium shots rather than stressing spectacle or glamour, more political thriller than costume epic. Indeed, with its bloody finale clearly inspired by The Godfather as Walsingham takes care of business for his Capo di tutti Capo, it's almost a mafia movie, with Cate Blanchett's star-making turn as Elizabeth filling in the Michael Corleone role as the heir apparent who must ruthlessly shed emotions and conscience to hold on to the throne. That journey from fresh-faced youth to impregnable white-faced icon gives the film a solid emotional arc that helps prevent it from becoming a simple series of confrontations and thwarted conspiracies, almost - but not quite - turning it into a tragedy of success rather than the usual tragedy of failure that is usually the lot of women in historical pictures (Anne of the Thousand Days, Mary Queen of Scots, Lady Jane, La Reine Margot, etc).It's handsomely cast: Joseph Fiennes gives good shallow romanticism as Elizabeth's lover Dudley, Christopher Eccleston in his default misery guts mode makes a fine villain and there's a healthy cast that, if not bursting with A-listers, is at least filled with familiar faces, from Richard Attenborough, Fanny Ardant, Daniel Craig and Vincent Cassel in a dress to Edward Hardwicke, Kelly McDonald, James Frain, Emily Mortimer and Eric Cantona. Yet perhaps even more than Blanchett it's a magnificent Geoffrey Rush who often dominates the film from the sidelines as the Queen's loyal and utterly unscrupulous spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham, a man who can seem all things to all men and women but is loyal only to her. Even when he's simply observing from afar he's a powerful presence in all the right ways, emanating a callous intelligence that is truly frightening.It's strange that the sequel has been attacked by the Vatican as anti-Catholic when this first chapter probably occupies a high place on Ian Paisley's Ten Best List, what with Kathy Burke's psychotic ""Bloody"" Mary burning Protestants and threatening to do the same to her half-sister and John Gielgud's Pope (earning fifth billing for barely two minutes' screen time) despatching Daniel Craig's priest to assassinate the Protestant queen not merely with his blessing but his promises of a welcome in heaven for any who help in the task. Not entirely inaccurate considering the many attempts by Catholic kingdoms like France and Spain to topple or assassinate Elizabeth during her reign, but a little more historical context might have been helpful for viewers not so familiar with Tudor politics and the causes and effects of the Reformation. It doesn't help that Michael Hirst's screenplay refers to Marie de Guise (Ardant) as Mary, Queen of Scots, leading some to assume she's THE famous Mary, Queen of Scots rather than her mother, but then the problem of just how much historical information you can include before it gets in the way of the drama is always a difficult one in a period film: too little and you don't know what's happening, too much and you feel like you should be taking notes in case there's a test later. Instead, this is content to follow Elizabeth's rise at the expense not just of her enemies but also some of her early friendships, keeping it personal even as Elizabeth has to shed her own personality to create an icon a divided nation can follow.

Throughout her reign as queen, she faces assassination attempts, newfound and lost love and political turmoil.  Through it all, the movie demonstrates her continuous power and how she deals with each hardship.First of all, this movie is one of the most beautiful I've seen, but in a dark form.  It sort of mesmerizes you, in that it is so different from what it is now.  Second of all, the movie wonderfully captures what the challanges of being a ruler were back then.  For instance, Elizabeth constantly had to face people secretly plotting against her and her subjects plotting against her enemies...without her knowledge.  It truly is a wonderful display of the British Empire as a whole.The acting in this movie was also spectacular.  Cate Blanchett shines in this powerhouse film.  She triumphantly takes in and conveys every emotion and feeling with such grace that it amazes you.  I felt that her competetor at the 1998 Oscars, Gwyneth Paltrow, did not have as difficult a role as Blanchett, thus making Blanchett the better choice for the award.  Unfortunately, the Acadamy did not believe this to be true.  I do think that if anybody were to see this film in full theater format compared to Shakespeare In Love, they would realize how much depth Blanchett as Elizabeth has.  I was blown away.Bottom Line:  Everyone should see this movie for its incredible acting, history, depth, cinematography, beauty, music and the costumes that helped make this film perfect.
