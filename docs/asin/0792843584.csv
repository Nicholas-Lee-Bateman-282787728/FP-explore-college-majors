149424,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0792843584,Acute Observer,"[1, 6]","Heaven's Gate, 1980 filmThe movie starts with a view of a tower, a man runs down a street to join a parade. They enter an auditorium. A minister makes a speech. Couples dance in a courtyard. Men struggle in a courtyard celebration.  Years later this man travels by train to the West. One man is ordered to leave a cow. Another man objects to this, but he also leaves. We see people walking with their baggage. [Believable?] A man visits a house. ""Cash or cattle?"" A train stops and travelers get off from a flatbed rail car. [This was during the worst economic depression of the 19th century.] There is a conflict in the street. Rich men talk about the danger from paupers. Juries won't convict. They hired fifty gunmen to invade Johnson County (Wyoming), kill the marshal, and 125 of the settlers. The Governor, Congressmen, and US President are in their pocket. [Are things different today?] ""Everything can be done.""Marshal Averell tells them to stay out of his county. Men gamble on a cockfight in a tavern. Averell tells of the death list of the Cattlemen's Association. Later Kate is happy to see him. There is a small village with settlers (who speak a Slavic language). People roller-skate on a wooden floor. [Believable?] We see many scenes that pad out this story. Averell advises Kate to leave the state before the war. The Stockgrower's Association offers a bounty of $50 for each dead man. Nate asks Kate to quit her business. Averell reads the names on the death list. We see men dragging cut timber. Averell warns the people about the planned murders of 125 men. A train carries the gunmen and their horses to Johnson County. [They were told they were hired to enforce arrest warrants.] Men attack Kate, Averell rescues her. He warns her of worse events to come. ""I'll miss you."" Citizens call on Averell for help. The gunmen surround a cabin and shoot at the inhabitants, who shoot back. A fire wagon is pushed against the cabin, Nate writes a farewell note. He is shot dead when he leaves the cabin.The men of the town gather to discuss the situation. The Cattlemen want to steal the lands and cattle of the small ranchers and homesteaders. [A modern form of feudalism, like eminent domain.] The citizens must organize to defend themselves. Armed, they ride out to attack the terrorist gunmen of the Cattlemen's Association. Averell recommends an attack using wooden shields on wheels. There is more shooting, wounded men fall. The terrorists are surrounded. But the US Cavalry rides to their rescue! [This violates US law by using the military to enforce civil law.] Later there is an attack on Ella and Jim, Ella die. Jim reminisces years later. [In history the lynching of ""Cattle Kate"" occurred in the beginning.]The value of this movie is its story about the infamous Johnson County War, the big corporations against the small ranchers and farmers. This event inspired many of the Western films of the 1930s and 1940s. A big rancher, who was in cahoots with the crooked mayor and sheriff, tried to steal the lands of ordinary citizens (until they could unite against their oppressors). This movie is overlong, it needed a better a better scriptwriter. It is not accurate in small details (except the murder of Nate Champion). The actions of the hired gunmen were far worse than shown in this movie. Asa Mercer was a journalist and eyewitness who wrote ""The Banditti of the Plains"".

149426,A3Q0Q9NJALDW82,0792843584,Amazon Customer,"[1, 4]","Heaven's Gate was an attempt to create a great movie, a great western. Unfortunately, director Michael Cimino got so bogged down with the detail and minutiae of creating a classic piece of cinema that he forgot all about character development, story structure, and pacing. There really is no plot. The movie is basically a 3-hour set up for a 30-minute battle sequence that ends badly for every character. But the movie is a visual feast.The biggest problem, the most important problem, is that we are never made to care for these characters and that we don't know them. We are never to know why Christopher Walken's bounty hunter, Nate Champion, is conflicted with killing immigrants. Yes, we do know he loves the immigrant Ella Watson but that is simply for the sake of what passes for plot. There is a moment when Walken's character threatens to kill an immigrant kid. The kid asks why and tells Walken that he's just like one of them. This theme is not developed. We never know why Kris Kristofferson's character, Jim Averill, is already a weary, beaten down man. The immigrants, hundreds of them, are not introduced as individuals, but as a giant mob of anonymous victims of the equally anonymous rich bad landowners.The good things: The photography. The American West has never looked this beautiful, or mythic.  The panoramic views of the large cold lakes, the massive snow capped mountains, and shots of the immigrants walking across dust filled roads toward their realization of the American Dream (soon to turn American Nightmare) are very moving and touching. The attention to period detail is fantastic.  The music, using the instruments and sounds of that period, adds to the great mood of epic tragedy.Watch Heaven's Gate with an open mind and remind yourself that, sure, this is not perfect film, but at least Michael Cimino tried to make something that was cinematic and mature, a film that dealt with the American Dream and American history in such a dark, cynical way.",3,"Heaven's Gate Flawed, Yes, but a Visual Stunner",1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,1986,"['Heaven', 'Gate', 'was', 'attempt', 'create', 'great', 'movie', 'great', 'western', 'Unfortunately', 'director', 'Michael', 'Cimino', 'got', 'so', 'bogged', 'down', 'detail', 'minutiae', 'creating', 'classic', 'piece', 'cinema', 'forgot', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'structure', 'pacing', 'really', 'plot', 'movie', 'basically', '3-hour', 'set', 'up', '30-minute', 'battle', 'sequence', 'badly', 'character', 'movie', 'visual', 'feast.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'most', 'important', 'problem', 'are', 'never', 'made', 'care', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'are', 'never', 'know', 'why', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Nate', 'Champion', 'conflicted', 'killing', 'immigrants', 'Yes', 'do', 'know', 'immigrant', 'Ella', 'Watson', 'simply', 'sake', 'what', 'plot', 'moment', 'when', 'Walken', 'character', 'kill', 'immigrant', 'kid', 'kid', 'why', 'Walken', 'just', 'one', 'theme', 'not', 'developed', 'never', 'know', 'why', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'character', 'Jim', 'Averill', 'already', 'weary', 'beaten', 'down', 'man', 'immigrants', 'hundreds', 'are', 'not', 'introduced', 'individuals', 'giant', 'mob', 'anonymous', 'victims', 'equally', 'anonymous', 'rich', 'bad', 'landowners.The', 'good', 'things', 'photography', 'American', 'West', 'never', 'looked', 'beautiful', 'mythic', 'panoramic', 'views', 'large', 'cold', 'lakes', 'massive', 'snow', 'capped', 'mountains', 'shots', 'immigrants', 'walking', 'dust', 'filled', 'roads', 'realization', 'American', 'Dream', 'soon', 'turn', 'American', 'Nightmare', 'are', 'very', 'moving', 'touching', 'attention', 'period', 'detail', 'fantastic', 'music', 'using', 'instruments', 'sounds', 'period', 'great', 'mood', 'epic', 'tragedy.Watch', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'open', 'mind', 'remind', 'sure', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'least', 'Michael', 'Cimino', 'tried', 'make', 'something', 'was', 'cinematic', 'mature', 'film', 'American', 'Dream', 'American', 'history', 'such', 'dark', 'cynical', 'way']",N/A
149427,A3O077PR8M4KYT,0792843584,Andrew Mangravite,"[5, 6]","It appears that people are coming around to the conclusion that ""Heaven's Gate"" is not the worst film ever made. So what I want to concentrate are a few reasons why it got that reputation in the first place.Let's start with the money. It's true that Cimino shot the budget to pieces on this film. In the director's defense I suspect that he would argue that it's all up there on the screen. But this type of spending will generate animosity on the part of both studio executives and film critics. It's happened before, notably when Brando was roasted for ""One-Eyed Jacks."" So to some extent the film was being willed to fail. People were incensed that Cimino spent United Artists into a hole and was quite unapologetic about it.Now let's look at the politics. ""Heaven's Gate"" came out during Ronald Reagan's first term in office. The political Right was ascendant and the message of ""Heaven's Gate"" was not the message that they wanted to hear. They were more in tune with the message of Owen Wister's novel The Virginian, namely that property was sacred and a rich man's cow was worth more than a poor man's life. I suspect that with the Occupy Movement and the talk about ""the 99%"" more people would be in tune with the film's depiction of The Rich as heartless, self-serving bastards than they would have been in 1980.Lastly, let's look at the film itself. One reviewer compared the film to ""The Leopard,"" ""1900"" and ""Once Upon a Time in America."" this was quite telling. None of these film was a smash with the American movie-going public when they premiered. And the Leone's film suffered a fate similar to Cimino's in that it was edited into incoherency by a studio desperate to salvage something from the ruins. The moral seems to be that American audiences don't like to sit through really long films. Now, is it true that in the heyday of Hollywood, M.G.M. could have done the same story with Robert Taylor and Robert Walker and brought it in at under two hours? Absolutely. But it wouldn't have been the same film. And that's my final point. Cimino was the storyteller and he had to tell the story his way. When the film first came out, I remember a critic of repute (it may have been Pauline Kael or Judith Crist) remarking that while it was easy to see what could have been cut from the film, the difficult part was deciding what should remain. (I assume that she was seeing the uncut version.) I would respond that Cimino needed to take all that time depicting James Averill's graduation day at Harvard because Averill would later remark that it was the best day of his life. It was necessary to film the aging Joseph Cotten delivering his exhortation to the graduating class because they clearly regarded it as hot air, and had no intention of living up to its demands. It was necessay to film John Hurt's clownish, preening response because Hurt was the kind of guy who would wind up out in Wyoming, killing immigrants who had the temerity to rustle cattle from their betters. I simply can not see the wisdom of denying Cimino his way of telling the story which, incidentally, was identical to the method he used in ""The Deer Hunter""--a film for which he was praised to the skies and declared to be a new director of genius.",5,"Different Tales, Different Tellers",1353974400,"11 27, 2012",2012,3239,"['people', 'are', 'coming', 'around', 'conclusion', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'not', 'worst', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'what', 'want', 'concentrate', 'are', 'few', 'reasons', 'why', 'got', 'reputation', 'first', 'place.Let', 'start', 'money', 'true', 'Cimino', 'shot', 'budget', 'pieces', 'film', 'director', 'defense', 'suspect', 'would', 'argue', 'up', 'there', 'screen', 'type', 'spending', 'will', 'generate', 'animosity', 'part', 'studio', 'executives', 'film', 'critics', 'happened', 'notably', 'when', 'Brando', 'was', 'roasted', 'One-Eyed', 'Jacks', 'extent', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'willed', 'fail', 'People', 'were', 'incensed', 'Cimino', 'spent', 'United', 'Artists', 'hole', 'was', 'quite', 'unapologetic', 'it.Now', 'let', 'look', 'politics', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'came', 'out', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'first', 'term', 'office', 'political', 'Right', 'was', 'ascendant', 'message', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'was', 'not', 'message', 'wanted', 'hear', 'were', 'more', 'tune', 'message', 'Owen', 'Wister', 'novel', 'Virginian', 'namely', 'property', 'was', 'sacred', 'rich', 'man', 'cow', 'was', 'more', 'poor', 'man', 'life', 'suspect', 'Occupy', 'Movement', 'talk', '99', '%', 'more', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'tune', 'film', 'depiction', 'Rich', 'heartless', 'self-serving', 'bastards', 'would', 'have', 'been', '1980.Lastly', 'let', 'look', 'film', 'One', 'reviewer', 'compared', 'film', 'Leopard', '1900', 'Once', 'Time', 'America', 'was', 'quite', 'telling', 'None', 'film', 'was', 'smash', 'American', 'movie-going', 'public', 'when', 'premiered', 'Leone', 'film', 'suffered', 'fate', 'similar', 'Cimino', 'was', 'edited', 'incoherency', 'studio', 'desperate', 'salvage', 'something', 'ruins', 'moral', 'be', 'American', 'audiences', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'sit', 'really', 'long', 'films', 'Now', 'true', 'heyday', 'Hollywood', 'M.G.M', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'same', 'story', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'Robert', 'Walker', 'brought', 'two', 'hours', 'Absolutely', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'same', 'film', 'final', 'point', 'Cimino', 'was', 'storyteller', 'had', 'tell', 'story', 'way', 'When', 'film', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'remember', 'critic', 'repute', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'Judith', 'Crist', 'remarking', 'was', 'easy', 'see', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'film', 'difficult', 'part', 'was', 'deciding', 'what', 'should', 'remain', 'assume', 'was', 'seeing', 'uncut', 'version', 'would', 'respond', 'Cimino', 'needed', 'take', 'time', 'depicting', 'James', 'Averill', 'graduation', 'day', 'Harvard', 'Averill', 'would', 'later', 'remark', 'was', 'best', 'day', 'life', 'was', 'necessary', 'film', 'aging', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'delivering', 'exhortation', 'graduating', 'class', 'clearly', 'regarded', 'hot', 'air', 'had', 'intention', 'living', 'up', 'demands', 'was', 'necessay', 'film', 'John', 'Hurt', 'clownish', 'preening', 'response', 'Hurt', 'was', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'would', 'wind', 'up', 'out', 'Wyoming', 'killing', 'immigrants', 'who', 'had', 'temerity', 'rustle', 'cattle', 'betters', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'wisdom', 'denying', 'Cimino', 'way', 'telling', 'story', 'incidentally', 'was', 'identical', 'method', 'used', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'film', 'was', 'praised', 'skies', 'declared', 'be', 'new', 'director', 'genius']",N/A
149428,A1UNXVMM0JCVLK,0792843584,"B B McGuire ""Buster""","[12, 14]","I recently had the chance to view this remarkable film in it's restored 3 and 1/2 + hour length with cinematographer Vilmos Zigmond introducing and talking about it. For 25 years I had heard the horror stories and scathing reviews but had never actually seen this supposed abomination (and can't believe some of the other reviewers on  Amazon watched the same movie I saw).Although I admire ""The Deer Hunter"", I have always considered it a bit over the top, and have never seen another Cimino film besides ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot"" that I really enjoyed, so I was prepared to just sit back and admire the cinematography.Maybe it helped that the immigration debate had been front page news and that the coverups and abuses of power of the current administration make one wonder what future generations will make of this time in history, but ""Heaven's Gate"" resonated loud and clear.The story of the Ivy League upper class using any means necessary to pursue what they view as manifest destiny and feeling threatened by the poor immigrant masses couldn't be more relevant today. It's not surprising that Zigmond also was DP on Robert Altman's ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"", because these two films paint a portrait of the emerging West better than most.The movie would be worth seeing even if the sound was ommitted because the visuals of the teaming Casper Wyoming streets, shops and train station; beautiful vistas; immigrants in their everyday living conditions, and at work and play are all so vividly portrayed that sometimes it was hard to take it all in, despite the deliberate leisurely pace of the movie.One scene that takes place in the Heaven's Gate meeting hall that features a roller skating fiddler and a multitude of characters skating and dancing with the camera following it all is one of the most stunning set pieces I have ever seen.Kris Kristofferson truly shines as does most of the cast, but Christopher Walken (despite some odd makeup) and Sam Waterson steal the show. As always Jeff Bridges is good, as is a heartbreaking Isabelle Huppert (watch out for a young Mickey Rourke and a nice turn by Richard Masur). Only John Hurt, so memorable the year before in ""Alien"", seems miscast.But the story of a greedy ruling class that wants it all and  bend the laws to fit their vision of the world shows that history does indeed repeat itself.

149429,A12QL3YE58F9RI,0792843584,"B. C. Whitcomb ""WTF?!""","[2, 3]","It's rare that a movie comes along that is so vilified, so hated, so repelling, yet so misunderstood. Heaven's Gate is, in the annals of film-making, one of the biggest single disasters ever. It went over-budget innumerable times; it was more of a testament to the ego of it's director, Michael Cimino; it was savaged by critics and the public alike for every one of its failings; and it ended the free-wheeling era of big-spending Hollywood. Looking back 25 years since its infamous debut, Heaven's Gate a movie that becomes stronger and better, not only for its craftmanship, but also for its compelling message. It's story is a multi-layered one, too many layers for any movie to have, perhaps. It presents itself as a cautionary tale on the subjects of morality, political power, and the paradoxes of human desires and failings. It's a human story that is so massive that one cannot watch it once, because you will miss something. The movie does stumble, from rambling, near-illiterate explanations of the complex nature of the human condition, to moments are sheer beauty and moving visual poetry. The one scene that strikes hardest is the one where Christopher Walken walks into Sam Waterson's tent and kills the man (Waterson's lieutenant) for raping the woman he loves. Waterson, after the incident, goes into a explanation of the law, (He is the law by association with the politically powerful.) he sets the morality, and Walken is to obey him. Walken then asks Waterson if he's ever killed a man, (Can Waterson do his own dirty work?) as if to say that Waterson cannot defend his own morality with determined action. Waterson runs outside the tent, unholsters a gun, and executes a bound prisoner.

It's quite an interesting film and even a very well made one. It bears many similarities to Cimino's earlier success, ""The Deer Hunter"": a focus on male solidarity and conflict, man returning to a more primitive state, a narrative structure that has the protagonist moving from civilization to a barbaric world and then back to a civilization that will be changed forever by preceding events. Like ""The Deer Hunter,"" this films deals in images more than words. Unlike ""The Deer Hunter,"" however, and this film's biggest failing, is the lack of a cast of the same strength that graced Cimino's earlier film. ""The Deer Hunter"" had Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep and Christopher Walken. ""Heaven's Gate"" gets Christopher Walken, but in a role for which he is ill suited, and instead of De Niro and Streep we get Kris Kristofferson and Isabelle Huppert. I don't knowwhat possessed Cimino to think Kristofferson could carry a film of this magnitude, but it's a dire miscalculation on his part. Kristofferson isn't necessarily a horrible actor, but he's certainly not strong enough to retain an audience's interest over the course of a 219 minute film. Isabelle Huppert is bland as well. The result is long scenes with little or no dialogue, in which feelings are supposedly being expressed in the faces of the actors; but since the actors aren't very strong, nothing is getting expressed. That's what makes ""Heaven's Gate"" much longer than it needs to be. There's really only a wisp of a tory, so if we're not fully engaged in the characters, what exactly are we supposed to be engaged in? However, the weak cast and writing aside, ""Heaven's Gate"" is still a remarkable achievement in its own way, and a much better film than a new generation of movie lovers has been led to believe. Cimino may stumble with actors, but he's got a iron-clad grasp of visuals, and puts some stunning and memorable images on the screen. The film feels much more like a product of the 70's than it does the 80's. At various times, it reminded me of ""Little Big Man,"" ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller,"" and ""The Wild Bunch.""

The emphasis is on noise and spectacle, but unlike 'the Deer Hunter', it is not rooted in character.  It is poorly filmed, the camera not staying still long enough to allow us to take it in; the clumsy editing and the refusal of successive camera angles to match breaks up any continuity.  The waltz scene should be magical, but is shot as if by a documentary team recording the making of the film.  John Hurt's smart-alecky, incomprehensible speech is profoundly alienating.  If, after ten minutes in a four-hour film you are lost, than the omens are bad.Even in its 'full' four hour version, 'Heaven's Gate' seems like it's been badly butchered - the editing is abrupt, the sound is botched.  Whole scenes seem to have been removed, all sense of momentum is repeatedly broken down.  The plot is difficult to follow because the characters keep mumbling, and because the film-making was rarely clear.  Characters are abruptly introduced and abandoned throughout.  There is no attempt to clarify the relationships between characters, place and event.  The action sequences verge on the abstract, dissolving into a senseless fog.  The imagery is similarly fuzzy, and there are too many pointlessly gratuitous camera movements.If 'Heaven's Gate' was supposed to be an epic piece of American storytelling, than it was clearly a failure.  But all the negative things I mentioned above, all no-nos in Hollywood, are virtues in European cinema.  The sense of narrative and generic fracture is pure Godard; the alienation of the individual from narrative, history, society and his environment is very Antonioni.  The attempt to make History and the People the heroes (all those idealising shots of characters against the sky) is familiar from Soviet cinema.The fact that 'Heaven's Gate' is almost a left-wing picture is another probable reason for its failure.  'The Deer Hunter' took a national trauma (Vietnam) and tried to heal it: hence its success.

Greene ""davidgreene52movie devotee""","[5, 7]","As an ardent fan of quality widescreen epic fare, I built a giant screen home theater in order to do justice to so many films that can seldom, if ever be seen in the sort of presentation for which they were expressly made.  I am thrilled to learn that Criterion has stepped up to the task of restoring Michael Cimino's ""Heaven's Gate"".  The DVD edition, which has, sadly, been the best version available, is a slap-dash affair.  It is not even anamorphically enhanced for widescreen TVs, and it has disappointing video and audio shortcomings throughout its considerable length.  Even with all of these problems, I have presented screenings for many friends over the past few years, and despite the many terrible reviews the film has received, all of the viewers in my facility found it an immensely worthwhile show.  If you are the kind of movie fan who grows impatient when the story does not unfold at a consistently fast pace, you should probably forget about this one.  On the other hand, if you favor films that are deeply thought-provoking and visually magnificent, you may agree with me that this one comes very close to being a masterpiece.  It's flaws include a soundtrack that buries too much of the dialogue in a flood of background noise and music.  (One might hope that the new Blu Ray restoration will clean up some of that problem.)  It also suffers from a final action sequence that is over-long and confusing, which can not help but hurt a production of this length.  Repeatedly, Cimino slows the pace of the plot by immersing you in sequences like a wild carriage ride and dancing and partying scenes, clearly designed to give you a feeling of being immersed in the life of the characters, their community, and their era.  I revel in such splendors; I'm sure some would differ with me about this.  A reviewer once said that, if David Lean had made a western, it might have been a lot like this one.  With the film's mature presentation of social problems that have clearly afflicted our country from early in its history to the present day, it is one of the most unusual grand-scale epics ever made.  I eagerly look forward to discovering what the folks at Criterion have accomplished with the remastering of some of the most magnificent cinematography ever accomplished.  Their DVD of ""Spartacus"" was so fine that it looks decidedly better than the subsequent Universal Blu Ray release.  P.S.: Having just viewed Criterion's restoration, I should note that it is now clear that, with all of its other strengths, ""Heaven's Gate"" can now be appreciated as nothing less than one of the most beautifully photographed films you'll ever see.

To my pleasant surprise, this is not a bad picture.  The film is not without faults, such as it's overlength and an occassionally muddled script.  Aside from that, it was an engaging picture and I definitely would not call it boring.  It brought to mind, at least to me, Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" but without that film's flair or larger than life characters.

149442,A20NK24YAZFO8Q,0792843584,"Dean T. Sinclair ""Geoman""","[3, 3]","It is amazing that this movie continues to inspire such a wide range of opinions, including so many haters.  You don't need me to recap the story or the controversy that accompanies this movie, so let me throw in what I CAN contribute.  First, if you have seen the movie, you have not seen it like Criterion (and Cimino) wants you to see it.  The original always seemed very brown to me, but the colors jump off the screen in this version.  I think it was brown for a reason, and now it is brighter for a reason.  I like it brighter.  Second, if you haven't seen the movie, keep in mind this is FICTION.  Cimino is not telling the story of the Johnson County War.  He is using that event as a starting point to tell a fictional story.  Apparently, some of the reviewers here simply cannot handle that, and instead want some kind of documentary.  That is not Cimino's purpose, and why should it be?  Thirdly, and for me most importantly, on watching this again, years after it was made, I think I get it.  I believe this movie is the last from the 1970s (released in 1980) that chronicles the ills of America and its views towards immigration, capitalism, class, power, wealth, poverty, violence, and so much else, all on the eve of the inauguration of Ronald Reagan and the whole notion of Morning in America.  This movie stands in direct opposition to that.  It was also, I think, released at a critical time in this country, in which the lower and middle classes begin the long slow sustained downward spiral that these classes still suffer from to this day in this country.  Cimino, I believe, saw this, and this sensibility infuses Heaven's Gate with its narrative power.  We don't want to face this. We don't want to imagine this.  So we reject it, and reject much of the art that holds this up to our eyes.  Heaven's Gate does that, in its slowly developing, sprawling narrative structure.If you have not seen Heaven's Gate, you owe it to yourself to see it.

The invented gun fight where the various people surround the gun men is so badly handled it is silly to watch.  The actual seige of the gunmen by the sheriff's posse of 200 men is ignored in favor of a silly circular wagon fight where the settlers are symbolic indians.Characters and their basic motives and history are misrepresented in so many instances that it is pointless to note them all.Beautifully photographed and as a child of people who actually lived through that era IN Wyoming that is the only redeeming thing about the picture.

149446,A1URWB7HMON61C,0792843584,dra,"[1, 3]","In Johnson County, Wyoming, in 1892, a cartel of stockowners obtains the consent of the governor and the President to rid their land of ""thieves and anarchists"". They have a list of 125 residents, mostly German and Eastern European immigrants, who are to be executed by their army of mercenaries. Marshall Jim Averill (Kris Kristofferson) is not only dismayed by the injustice, but by the fact that the list includes his mistress Ella (Isabelle Huppert), who runs the local brothel, and who shares her affections with Stock Association foreman Nate Champion (Christopher Walken). The townspeople are divided - some want to give up their neighbours whose names are on the list - but after a spirited meeting on the floor of Heaven's Gate, the town's roller-skating rink (sic), owned by John L. Bridges (Jeff Bridges), they decide to fight.This unfolds over 3 hours and 39 minutes, with pauses for, amongst other things, a massive choreographed waltz, stolen directly from Visconti's The Leopard, at a Harvard graduation ceremony (which, confusingly, was filmed in Oxford, which accounted for why it looked exactly like Oxford), a cockfight, some roller skating, Kristofferson and Huppert dancing around the deserted rink accompanied by local musicians (with a fiddle player who cavorted like Jake Busey in Starship Troopers), Nate showing off the wallpaper in his log cabin while Mickey Rourke (as a character who shares his name with 1950s director Nick Ray, but serendipitously was actually an historical figure) listens to a story about wolf hunting, and a town meeting which might be making stirring arguments against government-sanctioned genocide by rich landowners, except it's conducted entirely in un-subtitled Immigrant. There was also a point at which Averill started reading the names on the death list, structured: name - reaction shot of victim - outraged murmuring from others in crowd - repeat. After the first four names, I began to fear we might see all 125.The love triangle between Averill, Ella and Nate didn't greatly engage me. This might have been because Huppert capers about like a sprite in her early scenes, and later is unable to take the hint and get the hell out of town despite a narrow escape and the clear indication of impending doom. She just didn't seem that much of a catch, apart perhaps from being the only woman within hundreds of miles who seemed to have mastered English. Kristofferson was appropriately stoic and decent, although it's never explained why a Yankee silvertail felt the need to seek employment as a marshal in rural Wyoming. Walken commands the screen and moves with his dancer's grace. I can't tell you much more about their characters, but their wardrobe has stayed with me: both men wearing ties in every scene, Kristofferson's brown suits, Walken's crazily high-peaked hat, pale suit and long coat draped off his shoulders like Mitchum's in Out of the Past, if the colours had been done by Armani. Which, as well as the incredible leisureliness, sums up the other problem of Heaven's Gate: a compulsion toward lavish beauty, at the expense of all the other elements that ordinarily make a film a film.Jeff Bridges didn't look for a second like he belonged in a period film, which was down to his face and his bearing, but compounded by his beard and his outfit - Russian peasant's cap, tie, two-tone cardigan - which created an oddly precise impression of a contemporary inner-city hipster. Rather than dispensing quadruple whiskies, I expected him to offer Kristofferson fair trade soy lattes.John Hurt played a Harvard classmate of Kristofferson's who ended up a landowner in Wyoming, siding with the assassins but occasionally troubled by his tiny and ineffectual conscience, and uttering non-poetic non-profundities between pulls on a hip flask. If there has ever been a more redundant film character, I cannot recall it.I was daunted coming to this film by the dual challenges of the overwhelmingly negative criticism it received upon its release (the incomparable Pauline Kael basically said all there is to say) and the positive backlash that accompanied the release of the Criterion discs, and the legendary profligacy of its making. In short, this was the film that destroyed United Artists, which can be attributed to things like Cimino pulling down an entire set to widen a road by six feet. As it turns out, it's pretty straightforward to form an opinion about the film itself, which is vastly too long to support its simple plot, and not especially good. Not only do the three leads fail to engage, but the marked-for-death immigrants are given no distinguishing characteristics that couldn't be discerned from still photographs - nothing about them as people to care about.What is extraordinary is Vilmos Zsigmond's photography of the breathtaking Wyoming locations. It is said of some films that every frame could be a work of art in itself, and that's truer of Heaven's Gate than anything else I've seen. Not only the framing but the quality of the light is flawlessly chosen to make everything look exquisite, no matter how lacking in inherent dramatic or narrative value.It's clear that the fortune spent on this film didn't all go on cocaine. The sets and costumes are incredibly elaborate, even for locations that are used for a single scene, and even if some of the actors don't convince us we're seeing 1892 Wyoming, the production design does.I don't regret correcting my failure before now to see this notorious and controversial film, but I can't strongly recommend it.",3,Original critical reaction got it right,1364342400,"03 27,

149449,A2IB6KM1UL2Q6N,0792843584,"Dustin Blythe ""I love Amazon!""","[14, 16]","Many cinema fans know of or have heard of the ""Legend of Heaven's Gate""; huge flop, out of control director, bankrupted the studio, etc...  If you are interested enough in the movie to consider buying the DVD, then you are prepared to look past the legend and get to the real story.""Heaven's Gate"" is the labor of love of Michael Cimino.  Fresh from his award winning efforts on ""The Deer Hunter"", Cimino looked to bring to life the events surrounding the little known but fascinating Johnson County Wyoming range war in 1890-91.  Many of the circumstances that sparked the range war in the late 19th century were relevant in the late 20th century (and more so today); the friction between residents and the ever increasing flow of immigrants, concentration of wealth among a small powerful group of elite ranchers, their efforts to squeeze out small ranch operations and independent immigrant families, and the conflict felt by those in the middle who had ties to both sides.Kris Kristofferson plays Jim Averill, a man who came from a wealthy east coast family, went to Harvard, and was expected to do great things.  Upon hearing the message of the good doctor (Joseph Cotten) at his graduation ceremony, telling his class that they should go out and enrich society with their wealth and prestige, Averill decides to go out west and make his mark among the citizens of the rough frontier.  Upon arriving in Wyoming, Averill joins the Cattlemen's Association as does his fraternity brother from Harvard,Billy Irvine (John Hurt).  Once he becomes a member of this august group, Averill discovers it is nothing more than a gathering of rich elitists from the east bent on cornering the beef market in the west and stamping out those who stand in their way.  Frustrated with their attitudes, he leaves acrimoniously while Billy continues upon the course he began in college, drinking himself irrelevant.Averill decides to use what influence he has for good purposes and becomes the sherriff of Johnson County, keeping peace in a land becoming filled with newcomers and the residents who resent their intrusion.  While in office he becomes involved with the town madam Ella(Isabelle Huppert) who happens to count the Cattlemen's enforcer, Nate Champion (Christopher Walken) among her clients.  Averill understands Champion's position and the two are friendly until the Association takes the drastic step of branding the immigrants ""anarchists"" and declaring war on them for cattle theivery.  Averill has tried to hold the line and keep the Association from flexing their considerable muscle in his county, but this move unleashes the force of the Association (physical and political) culminating in a pitched battle between the two sides.  Averill leads the immigrants in a spirited defense against the Association and their army of hired guns.  In the end, this ""rich man's army"" is saved from defeat by the U.S. Army and the immigrants are left to bury their dead and wonder what happens next.After witnessing the carnage, Averill and Ella pack their belongings to start anew further west when they are ambushed by members of the Association, angry at their efforts to organize the immigrants against them.  Ella is killed and Averill realizes the futility of fighting the system when he has nothing left to fight for.  He returns to the east, marries the girl he was meant to end up with, and spends his twilight years (symbolically) drifting on a yacht in Newport harbor Rhode Island wondering what might have been and trying to live with what he has experienced.While there are some uneven patches in the film, it is an engrossing story that is wonderfully shot.  The cinematography is excellent and the locations are stunning.  The soundtrack is a great mix of European, early American, and folk that evokes the time and melting pot feel of the area.  (the cd is out of print, but worth tracking down.  It is available used through Amazon.)  I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys sweeping, epic pictures and also to anyone who has an interest in this period of American history.  The themes in this film resonate to this day; should wealth be horded by a privileged few? what are the consequences of the influence wealthy, powerful men hold over our elected officials?  who will stand up for those who are less fortunate in our society?  does power, money and influence equal right?  Finally, in addition to the actors I have mentioned, this film also stars Sam Waterston, Jeff Bridges, and Mickey Rourke (in a bit part). To those who are interested enough to want to read the true story about the Johnson County War, I recommend the ""Powder River War"" by Helena Huntington Smith.",4,"intriguing, flawed epic",1132790400,"11 24, 2005",2005,4687,"['Many', 'cinema', 'fans', 'know', 'have', 'heard', 'Legend', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'huge', 'flop', 'control', 'director', 'bankrupted', 'studio', 'etc', 'are', 'interested', 'enough', 'movie', 'consider', 'buying', 'DVD', 'then', 'are', 'prepared', 'look', 'legend', 'get', 'real', 'story', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'labor', 'love', 'Michael', 'Cimino', 'Fresh', 'award', 'winning', 'efforts', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'Cimino', 'looked', 'bring', 'life', 'events', 'surrounding', 'little', 'known', 'fascinating', 'Johnson', 'County', 'Wyoming', 'range', 'war', '1890-91', 'Many', 'circumstances', 'sparked', 'range', 'war', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'were', 'relevant', 'late', '20th', 'century', 'more', 'so', 'today', 'friction', 'residents', 'ever', 'increasing', 'flow', 'immigrants', 'concentration', 'wealth', 'small', 'powerful', 'group', 'elite', 'ranchers', 'efforts', 'squeeze', 'out', 'small', 'ranch', 'operations', 'independent', 'immigrant', 'families', 'conflict', 'felt', 'middle', 'who', 'had', 'ties', 'sides.Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'Jim', 'Averill', 'man', 'who', 'came', 'wealthy', 'east', 'coast', 'family', 'went', 'Harvard', 'was', 'expected', 'do', 'great', 'things', 'hearing', 'message', 'good', 'doctor', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'graduation', 'ceremony', 'telling', 'class', 'should', 'go', 'out', 'enrich', 'society', 'wealth', 'prestige', 'Averill', 'go', 'out', 'west', 'make', 'mark', 'citizens', 'rough', 'frontier', 'arriving', 'Wyoming', 'Averill', 'Cattlemen', 'Association', 'fraternity', 'brother', 'Harvard', 'Billy', 'Irvine', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Once', 'member', 'august', 'group', 'Averill', 'nothing', 'more', 'gathering', 'rich', 'elitists', 'east', 'bent', 'cornering', 'beef', 'market', 'west', 'stamping', 'out', 'who', 'stand', 'way', 'Frustrated', 'attitudes', 'acrimoniously', 'Billy', 'course', 'began', 'college', 'drinking', 'irrelevant.Averill', 'decides', 'use', 'what', 'influence', 'good', 'purposes', 'sherriff', 'Johnson', 'County', 'keeping', 'peace', 'land', 'becoming', 'filled', 'newcomers', 'residents', 'who', 'resent', 'intrusion', 'office', 'involved', 'town', 'madam', 'Ella', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'who', 'count', 'Cattlemen', 'enforcer', 'Nate', 'Champion', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'clients', 'Averill', 'Champion', 'position', 'two', 'are', 'friendly', 'Association', 'drastic', 'step', 'branding', 'immigrants', 'anarchists', 'declaring', 'war', 'cattle', 'theivery', 'Averill', 'tried', 'hold', 'line', 'keep', 'Association', 'flexing', 'considerable', 'muscle', 'county', 'move', 'force', 'Association', 'physical', 'political', 'culminating', 'pitched', 'battle', 'two', 'sides', 'Averill', 'immigrants', 'spirited', 'defense', 'Association', 'army', 'hired', 'guns', 'end', 'rich', 'man', 'army', 'saved', 'defeat', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'immigrants', 'are', 'left', 'bury', 'dead', 'wonder', 'what', 'next.After', 'witnessing', 'carnage', 'Averill', 'Ella', 'pack', 'belongings', 'start', 'anew', 'further', 'west', 'when', 'are', 'ambushed', 'members', 'Association', 'angry', 'efforts', 'organize', 'immigrants', 'Ella', 'killed', 'Averill', 'futility', 'fighting', 'system', 'when', 'nothing', 'left', 'fight', 'east', 'girl', 'was', 'meant', 'end', 'up', 'twilight', 'years', 'symbolically', 'drifting', 'yacht', 'Newport', 'harbor', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'wondering', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'live', 'what', 'experienced.While', 'are', 'uneven', 'patches', 'film', 'engrossing', 'story', 'wonderfully', 'shot', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'locations', 'are', 'stunning', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'mix', 'European', 'early', 'American', 'folk', 'time', 'melting', 'pot', 'feel', 'area', 'cd', 'print', 'tracking', 'down', 'available', 'used', 'Amazon', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'sweeping', 'epic', 'pictures', 'also', 'anyone', 'who', 'interest', 'period', 'American', 'history', 'themes', 'film', 'resonate', 'day', 'should', 'wealth', 'be', 'horded', 'privileged', 'few', 'are', 'consequences', 'influence', 'wealthy', 'powerful', 'men', 'hold', 'elected', 'officials', 'who', 'will', 'stand', 'up', 'who', 'are', 'less', 'fortunate', 'society', 'power', 'money', 'influence', 'equal', 'right', 'Finally', 'addition', 'actors', 'have', 'mentioned', 'film', 'also', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'bit', 'part', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'enough', 'want', 'read', 'true', 'story', 'Johnson', 'County', 'War', 'recommend', 'Powder', 'River', 'War', 'Helena', 'Huntington', 'Smith']",N/A
149450,A5QCKO0LL1D5E,0792843584,dv_forever,"[8, 15]","This infamous movie has a bit of a cult following it seems. I didn't come to see this film because I wanted to watch a legendary disastrous production. I was compelled to watch from a more noble cause. I kind of enjoy Michael Cimino's grand operatic style. He is somewhat reminiscent of Sergio Leone, sometimes of Bernardo Bertolucci. Those Italian directors are clearly inspired by the great tradition of Italian opera stemming back to the days of Verdi. Michael Cimino is also of Italian heritage, so the operatic lifeblood is strong within him. Those epic feelings are perfectly suited to the landscape of the American West before it was civilized.Having enjoyed ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Year of the Dragon"", even if those films had their faults, I wanted to see Heaven's Gate and to fall in love with it. To love a movie that has been attacked by many critics. Unfortunately, that's just not reality. This is a 3 hour 40 minute monstrosity of a movie. If you are going to make a film longer than ""Godfather Part II"" or ""Seven Samurai"", as long as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and nearly as long as ""Gone with the Wind"", you as the director have some things you need to do. Your plot must be multi-layered and flow naturally, your characters need to be compelling and evolving, your cinematography, music, art direction must be top of the line. Most of all the editing and pacing must be dead on, perfectly in synch to the needs of story that has clear direction and implications. You absolutely need an ambitious climax to end all climaxes. You at least strive for those things.How does Heaven's Gate stack up? It fails and fails miserably. The movie looks good for the most part, it desperately needs some sort of cleaning up of the negative, a real remastering. The music doesn't have the emotional reach that inspired some of this director's other films. The characters are some of the most boring I've ever encountered in a so called epic. Remember Peter O'toole in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or Alec Guiness in ""Bridge on the river Kwai""? Toshiro Mifune in ""Seven Samurai"", Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in ""Godfather Part II""? Clint Eastwood in ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"", Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson in ""Once Upon A Time in the West""? Who in this film is even remotely in that league of a quintessential character?This is one of the dreariest films around. Special mention should go to the supporting characters, who play some of the biggest motormouthed, cartoonish clowns I've ever encountered in the movies. Since they play the roles of mostly fresh European immigrants, you can't understand much of what they are saying. That's not the issue. It's their handling by the director that's problematic. They become such a nuisance that you as the viewer cease to care about their fate! The villain is played by Sam Waterston of ""Law and Order"" fame. He's just there to cause problems, not much for him to do. John Hurt gives an idealistic speech at the opening of the film and then plays a disillusioned, idiot alcoholic for the remainder of the running time. Also introduced during this first scene at Harvard is the main character played by Kris Kristofferson who will journey out West in the coming years.Speaking about that opening sequence... It is supposed to take place at Harvard, circa 1870, actually was filmed at Oxford in England. The opening scene with it's bloated pomposity establishes the character of the whole film. Even so, the over blown staging of the opening does contain energy and enthusiasm, something completely lacking from most of the remaining three plus hours.After the death of Christopher Walken, ( one of the three main characters ), comes the climactic battle and it's unforgettable for it's sheer boredom, poor staging and editing. Then there is a ridiculously inserted shoot out scene that disposes of Sam Waterston ( the villain ), Jeff Bridges ( friend of the main character ) and the female lead Isabelle Huppert ( the love interest ). Completely out of the blue, coming after the main climax of the film, it is awful storytelling to try and wrap up this bad movie on an even worse note. But you haven't seen anything yet! Our protagonist Kris Kristofferson returns to his Eastern seaboard life, more than a decade has elapsed. He is on a luxurious yacht with presumably his wife. He lights her cigarette for her. No words are spoken. It is a cold and distant marriage. Kristofferson's ideals and passions are long behind him. He walks out from the yacht's cabin and we get a wide shot of him standing there. Finito! 3 hours and 40 minutes building to a lousy climax, poorly inserted death scene for major characters and a totally empty, absolutely predictable conclusion. How about I just watch the opening scene at Harvard and then skip to the epilogue? Makes a better movie without all the poorly build up nonsense.This film does get to some viewers and the perhaps the first 1 hour and 30 minutes work on some level, simply from the visual splendour and over the top production design. As the clock keeps ticking away, you begin to understand that this film will not lead to any place significant. It will continue to meander in a half-hearted stew until your eyes glaze over from boredom and apathy. The absolutely lousy characterizations and go nowhere plot will make you yearn for the death of all these idiots! You almost get your wish, only Kristofferson lives to dull us for another day!I'm not even going to go into the many historical errors and twisting of facts from which this film was conceived. I'm after cinematic poetry, not necessarily a history lesson. Based upon it's disgraced reputation, I wanted to discover some sort of lost gem of epic cinema that is overlooked by most film buffs. I already liked Michael Cimino's style somewhat. I did not find any hidden classic in Heaven's Gate. Not at all. It's considered a disaster for good reason. Cimino ran away with a head full of ambition and no way to turn that ambition into an even remotely palatable movie. Ok, one good thing. It was cool seeing the young Mickey Rourke onscreen. Even in a small role, he makes an impression.Here's an idea for all you film lovers. How about watching Terence Malick's ""Days of Heaven"". 95 minutes of some of the most blissful moviemaking ever created. That is the very definition of a cinematic gemstone. Heaven's Gate on the other hand belongs in the dustbin of film history!",2,"Grandiose. Pompous. Wannabe epic.

149453,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,0792843584,Erik North,"[3, 3]","Where to begin?It was a film that was so expensive to make, and such a catastrophic critical and box office disaster, that it literally ended the existence of a once-great film studio.  Its failure also all but ended the existence of a once-proud film genre, the Western.  The litany and avalanche of criticism, gossip, and talk of directorial excess on it virtually closed the shop down on tyro directors who could have their way with the studios and go to town on both budgets and schedules, at least for a time.It was Michael Cimino's HEAVEN'S GATE.  It was his attempt to make a Western of the scope of past screen epics like GONE WITH THE WIND, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, and BEN HUR.  And it crashed badly, returning a miserable $1.3 million on a budget of close to $45 million when it opened (for one single weekend) in November 1980 (it was re-released in April 1981 in a vastly shortened version, and did no better).But just how bad of a film is it, in actuality?  Compared to other films of more recent times that have either cost much more and failed much worse at the box office, or films that have been hyped up beyond reason and in the end never really delivered, is this really the cataclysm a lot of people make it out to be even to this day?  In my humble opinion, having seen this film on five different occasions just to convince myself, the answer is ""No.""It has to be conceded that this film, a very loose recreation of the Johnson County range war that raged in the 1890s in Wyoming between European immigrants and ruthless cattle barons, is excessive, particularly given its genre: oversized sets; Western towns that look dangerously like big cities; individual set pieces that seem to go on forever.  All of that I think any reasonable view of the film will reveal to be true.  If Steven Spielberg's biggest sin in having made the equally maligned World War II comedy ""1941"" around the same time as this film was in not realizing until it was too late that slapstick comedy wasn't his forte, then Cimino's sin in making HEAVEN'S GATE the way he did was in not realizing that the Western wasn't really his thing.  His visions of making a David Lean/Cecil B. DeMille-type epic obscured the fact that such grandeur wasn't really what the Western genre was about, either historically or cinematically.  He didn't have the experience of a John Ford, a Howard Hawks, or a Henry Hathaway in this arena.  He also unfortunately seemed to lack the ability to see the things that worked in more recent Western epics like director Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST and Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH, both towering masterpieces from 1969, both of whose stories develop into epics; they're not full-born at the start.  In short, it's very possible that Cimino couldn't see the forest for the trees...at least not through all the smoke and the dust that gets spread around in the film.And yet, somehow, there's a lot to like for any viewer with the patience to sit through the more than three and a half hours of film.  The cast, which includes Kris Kristofferson, Christopher Walken, Sam Waterston, John Hurt, Jeff Bridges, Brad Dourif, Joseph Cotten, and Isabelle Hupert, does very solid work, even if they were exposed to doing dozens and dozens of takes under Cimino's uber-perfectionistic direction.  The cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond, who had won an Oscar for his work on Spielberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND in 1977, is impressive enough, even if sometimes obscured by the aforementioned smoke and dust, especially in the final (and rather violent) battle sequence.  The period score by David Mansfield (who also has a cameo role) is also fairly impressive, sometimes echoing the score that Ennio Morricone composed for ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST; and in utilizing Johann Strauss' ""The Blue Danube"", both in Mansfield's solo guitar version (near the end) and Leonard Bernstein's 1965 New York Philharmonic recording (in the Harvard prologue of the film, set in 1870), Cimino may be tipping his cap to Stanley Kubrick's cagey use of the Strauss waltz in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  The end result may be extravagant to an obvious fault, but one can't fault Cimino for not trying hard enough, just for trying a bit too much.The film's recent re-release in Cimino's first version (lasting just over three and a half hours) in New York theatres, and on DVD, has led its most ardent defenders to claim HEAVEN'S GATE as the masterpiece that nobody recognized back in 1980-81.  I don't know that I'd quite call it a masterpiece, for the reasons I've stated.  But even with its numerous attendant flaws, HEAVEN'S GATE is also nowhere near the catastrophe its detractors have made it out to be for decades, not by a long shot.  It is a film that needs to be seen with an open mind, which a lot of people still seem exceptionally reluctant to do.",4,"HEAVEN'S GATE: Not A Masterpiece, But Nowhere Near A Disaster",1366070400,"04

It virtually bankrupted United Artists and destroyed the career of upcoming and then ""golden boy"" director Michael Cimino for excessive expenditures on this production. I do not think HEAVEN'S GATE is a bad film. The negative press that Michael Cimino endured and the fact that the film was generally released in a heavily edited version actually hurt this film's acceptance on any artistic level. The diverse cast looks very seasoned, the detailed production designs are highly convincing, the photography is lush yet gritty and the script is visually enthralling and captivating. This is a big budgeted low key telling of a struggle for land, a place to live, yet where ideologies clash over the ownership and use of the environment. Some images of SHANE come to mind. It is the same ideological struggle of the West but devoid of the passion that George Stevens injected into SHANE. Cimino's vision is a bit muddled and seems rather self centered on some individualistic higher moral standard. The film is emotional but Kris Kristofferson's central character lives in an artificial world. This is metaphorically represented at the film's conclusion as Kristofferson is depicted living out his days in a mundane existence shown aboard an opulent steam launch in almost surrealist looking tranquil New England waters. The film never seems to come to a satisfactory conclusion or resolution of the conflict in the traditional sense of the Western.

I initially rented it on VHS in the 1980's, and shut it off, because the negative press affected me so much, I kept saying to myself how awful it was.  Then a few years later, I rented it again, and said ""it isn't that bad"".  Then I rented it in a letterboxed version, and realised just how gorgeous and tragic the film is.  It's an unqualified masterpiece, and kudos to the reviewers on this page for pointing this out.  One reviewer compared it to Visconti's The Leopard, Bertolucci's 1900, and Leone's Once Upon a Time in America.  It is a worthy comparison.  Cimino was ostracized (to say the least) for this film.  While he still managed to make a few more films (Year of the Dragon, The Silician), his career was essentially over.  The critics dumped on the film, mainly because of its turbulent production history (it did have a troubled production, but many great films have).  The original version ran 219 minutes, but after a disastrous premiere (mainly the critics trashing the film), Cimino recut it to 149 minutes.

I also have no idea why the peasants were shot. The movie either doesn't explain these things or does so in such vague ways that you will miss them. Much of the dialogue was unintelligible! The dialogue soundtrack was muddy and the acting appeared to be drug influenced (later stories about the filming stated that drug use was widespread on the set).

Unfortunately, most people can't sit through a 4-hour movie.  If you are one of those persons who can appreciate a complex narrative, delivered by a stunning cast, that tells a more candid tale of the West, then ""Heaven's Gate"" is a real treat.Cimino has collected a set of compelling stories that swirl around the range wars of the Montana.  He relates these stories through his protaganist, a federal marshall played by Kris Kristofferson.  His thoughts drift back to Harvard Yard in the opening sequence, where he reveled in the commencement ceremonies with his old schoolmate, John Hurt.  Much of this scene was chopped out in the theatrical release, undermining the content of the film.  It is this Eastern view, which Cimino wants you to take note of.  How one can meld into the West as Kristofferson does, and how one can become part and parcel of the cattle syndicate as Hurt did.The stories mainly focus around the Eastern European immigrants who attempted to carve out a life in late 19th-century Montana.  They came up against the great cattle syndicates, who owned much of the range, leaving little for the immigrants to settle on.  Cimino gives you a very intimate view of the events.  His camera angles take you right into the action.  This is a very visceral movie.Eventually these immigrants come up against the cattle barons, who had formed their own vigilante gangs in an attempt to combat the encroachment of the new settlers on their land.  Kristofferson has grown close to the immigrants and eventually chooses to support their claims, leading to a final gut-wrenching confrontation, which includes his old schoolmate, John Hurt.The cast is first rate.  Walken, Bridges, Huppert, Watterston all give excellent performances.  Cimino has inverted many of the myths that surround the Old West, and provided a living history.  The film almost has the quality of a sepia tone, as he has muted his colors to give the sense of age.

Cimino attempted an epic western on a grand scale, but I think he attempted to do too much and ended up with a flawed but still worthwhile movie.  There's a plot leap at the beginning and an astounding one at the end; I guess he ran out of time and budget money and ideas. He even went overboard on custumes and staging, which decreases the realism of the movie.For example, the dressed-up Kristofferson and others in neat, clean, starched shirts and ties going about his business as if that's way some guys did it in those days, especially if they arrived in the West with a college degree. The scene at the meeting hall where the folks in their immigrant attire are neatly seated and flawlessly lined up - can't you see the director spouting orders to arrange this ?The forgettable, odd, 20-year leap at the end to a neat 50-foot yacht where the financially successful (somehow) Kristofferson in happily sailing into the unknown with his woman. I guess you can't keep a good man down.

Yes, it damaged the director's reputation. Yes, it bankrupted the studio. Yes, it failed at the time to live up to the hype. And yet, leaving all that aside, we have as sumptuously a mounted western as you'll ever see, and a complex, fascinating story. For too long people have been unwilling to forgive the perfectionism that went into the production. What they're missing is a film which takes the time to set up a recreation of a true chain of events which ought to be remebered - for comparison, watch the much shorter, glossier Johnson County War. This is the real deal. Buy the full-length Director's Cut, not the truncated version. If you love Hollywood history, especially the 70s when this was devised and filmed, then this is right up there in terms of significance with The Godfather and Apocalypse Now. Not to say that Heaven's Gate isn't flawed. There are traces of self-indulgence - moments when we want a gritty West, not touches of David Lean.

149474,A3OD7GOXPSO9Z,0792843584,JLR,"[8, 12]","When it was announced that Criterion would distribute the American Blu-Ray release of Michael Cimino's ""Heaven's Gate"", many movie fans were understandably puzzled. Like, why on Earth would a respected company like Criterion distribute a movie that not only bankrupted a studio and destroyed the career of a young, promising director, but also signaled the end of what some felt was the second ""Golden Age"" of American movies - a period where young American directors were given the carte blanche to make the movies they wanted?Well, it's a lot more complicated than you think. As everyone knows, ""Heaven's Gate"" was a critical and commercial disaster upon release, grossing a piddling $3.5 million worldwide for its $44 million budget. More than any box-office bomb in cinema history, ""Heaven's Gate"" became a symbol of cinematic failure and directing hubris, a representation of what happens when a movie director and studio needlessly waste money to achieve promising but never fulfilling success. It sank director Michael Cimino's career, bankrupted United Artists and forced producers to put young filmmakers on a tighter leech. Its overwhelming bad reputation as Hollywood's stink bomb lingered over its head like a vicious thunderstorm.Then a few years later, ""Heaven's Gate"" found release in Europe and was seen as a revelation. The version that was shown there was not the 149-minute edit that Cimino released in theaters, but the original 4-hour cut that was eviscerated by critics in its premiere. European critics rapturously praised the movie, some who went overboard like Robin Wood, who called ""Heaven's Gate"" one of the supreme achievements of the Hollywood cinema. Others chided Hollywood producers for ruining the movie and the critics for not seeing the merits that it had possessed. One even went as far as to call its poor press screenings as ""one of the greatest injustices of cinematic history"".In 1985, the original 4-hour cut of ""Heaven's Gate"" was shown by the pay cable channel Z Channel, thus obtaining newer life. Throughout the 1990s and especially the early millennium, ""Heaven's Gate"" was slowly and gradually receiving a critical re-evaluation, until finally the movie was released on DVD by MGM in its original 4-hour version. Unfortunately, any attempt to discover the movie's rewards was thwarted by its horrendous picture quality, which included the infamous dirt brown color. This apparently wrinkled Cimino, who completely restored and remastered the movie, ditching the irritating brown color and restoring it in a form that the filmmaker originally intended back in 1980.So after many years, ""Heaven's Gate"" has finally made its long-awaited Blu-Ray debut in the United States and stripped of its initial negative hype and the rapturous reception it received in Europe and ""Heaven's Gate"" reveals itself as neither masterpiece or a disaster, but an ordinary movie - a meticulously crafted but emotionally unsatisfying and severely faulty epic. By the end of its four-hour length, moviegoers will ponder over what its supporters saw in the movie that makes it a masterpiece.For all its faults, ""Heaven's Gate"" does deserve commendation for its stunning imagery, which has been beautifully preserved and restored by Criterion. The movie is a masterpiece of pictorial beauty; gorgeous images that have the authenticity of a historical photograph or a brush painting. Visually, photographer Vilmos Zsigmond and Michael Cimino really do create a mainly convincing picture of the birth of a nation. In an ages where computer-generated effects and digital photography have become the norm, the visual palettes, period detail and sweeping camera work of ""Heaven's Gate"" remain staggeringly impressive. After that horrific MGM disc with its dirt brown look, ""Heaven's Gate"" looks like a godsend on Criterion. Any cinematographer that wants to learn how to capture the look and feel of the old West will definitely get their money's worth here.But in terms of characterization and narrative, ""Heaven's Gate"" is a failure. For all its spectacular beauty, ""Heaven's Gate"" cannot compensate for its unwritten and emotionally lacking characters or oblique narrative. Even though it is based on the Johnson County Wars, ""Heaven's Gate"" goes on too long and all over the place, leaving moviegoers confused and bored. The love triangle between Kris Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert and Christopher Walken itself not only take 90 minutes to start, but an equal amount of time to build their relationships. That's a huge no-no in the field of screenwriting, as it should take a fraction of that time to achieve those goals. In Cimino's similarly long ""The Deer Hunter"" (1978), we already know the characters and their relationships before the half-hour mark. Even in four-hour epics like ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Doctor Zhivago"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"", the filmmakers successfully introduces the viewers to the characters and their relationships within a half-hour.The characters themselves are sketchily written and barely develop. The performances by Kris Kristofferson and Isabelle Huppert as the idealistic Jim Averill and his lover Ella Watson are disappointingly flat. Although they share a passionate love for another, Kristofferson and Huppert have neither the emotional sparks of Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh in ""Gone With the Wind"" or the tragic dimension of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in ""Casablanca"" or even Omar Sharif and Julie Christie in ""Doctor Zhivago"". The emigrants, who are the main drive behind the movie's central themes of the capitalist oppression versus the common people, are completely devoid of individual personalities, not a single one of them standing out as someone we can identify with. Jeff Bridges, Brad Dourif and Mickey Rourke are also wasted in their roles while John Hurt is irritatingly hammy as Bill Irvine, who plays like a nihilistic version of Doc Boone from ""Stagecoach"". The only actor that brings this movie to life is Christopher Walken as the ambivalent Nate Champion, who falls in love with Ella. Then again, Walken can pretty much make any bad movie tolerable. The first time we see Champion when he brutally shots a settler, it produces a strong evocation that almost all the subsequent sequences (even the climatic battle scenes) lack. Champion's transition from an Association hired gun to protector of Ella Watson in the face of the impending death list is the only emotional link to be found in this bloated mess.The greatest detriment in ""Heaven's Gate"" isn't the minimal characterization, bewildering narrative or even its pro-Marxist politics, but it's sluggish, sluggish pacing. ""Heaven's Gate"" moves like an elephant - a big, grand animal whom you would never bet in an animal race. Sequences are either useless or drag on for too long. Even the climatic battle between the emigrants and the Association seems never-ending, suffering from one repetitive explosion after another. Many scenes that have the potential to move are undermined by their length. Even the concluding yacht sequence, which shows a disillusioned Averill in contrast to his idealistic self in the opening sequences, drags on, even though we`re supposed to feel its melancholic tone. The major flaw in ""Heaven's Gate"" is not what should have been cut out, but what should have been cut DOWN. Unfortunately, when you've got characters that are one-dimensional and lifeless, it's a daunting task to achieve.Ironically, ""Heaven's Gate""'s major flaw in sacrificing emotional substance for visual pleasure also pertains for the Criterion Blu-Ray. Although the picture and audio quality are excellent, the supplements on the Criterion disc are a huge letdown. It's been well documented that ""Heaven's Gate"" was a financial disaster that bankrupted United Artists, destroyed the careers of Michael Cimino and Kris Kristofferson and ended what many have felt was one of the most prosperously creative periods in cinema history, a period where directors had the final say and were allowed to tackle subjects considered taboo even by today's standards. It also served as a symbol of managerial stupidity in how studio executives incompetently made avoidable mistakes (such as giving the director an unlimited budget) that led to the demise of the studio and unraveling of many careers within it. The movie was virtually unseen in America until the Z Channel showed it in its uncut form and received a positive, if not enthusiastic, re-evaluation. Most of all, as stated earlier, it was rapturously received by European critics and was recently acclaimed by a few recent American ones (Manohla Dargis, Michael Atkinson, Richard Brody, etc.)Disappointingly, you won't find any of this on the Criterion version, which is baffling because the release of ""Heaven's Gate"" was a pivotal moment in American cinema. A topic like this should be a no-brainer for a respected distributor like Criterion, yet it has been completely ignored (except for the booklet by Giulia D'Agnolo Vallan, who speaks more detail about the film's history than the supplements themselves) and in its place are extra features that I consider mundane at best. There's an audio interview between Cimino and producer Joann Carelli, which is disappointingly flat and, most surprisingly, does not deal the issues Cimino had with the producers who tried to have him fired. There are also interviews with actor Kris Kristofferson, composer David Mansfield and assistant director Michael Stevenson, who speak glowingly about Cimino's attention to detail but skips on the movie's production problems as well. The most interesting portions of the interviews is when Stevenson bizarrely compares Cimino to Kubrick, Lean and Mann and Mansfield remarks that he got hired after John Williams passed on the project. The only worthy supplement is the restoration demonstration, which shows how the restoration team obliterated the infamous muddy brown look and brought the movie back to its mostly original form.While it's understandable that ""Heaven's Gate"" has its euphoric defenders, it's ridiculous that Criterion chose to ignore not only the negative repercussions it had on the American film industry or its detractors, but also its production history. Like, where's the critical analysis for or against the film? Where's the discussion table involving the defenders and detractors alike? What about a thorough account on the movie's production? There's a great book about ""Heaven's Gate"" called ""The Final Cut"" by Steven Bach, which covers more ground, and there was even a 80-minute documentary about the movie that was fair and actually defended Cimino. In fact, they could have added the documentary to the movie and it would have made the bonus disc worthwhile. Even a featurette on how the movie was rescued by the Z Channel would have added more value.But there's none of that and all you get here are a bunch of fluff pieces praising Cimino as a visionary. I'm sorry, but choosing to ignore ""Heaven's Gate""'s infamous past is like pretending that ""Cleopatra"" had a smooth production. If the supplements themselves were interesting, I'd be less aggravated. But the poor quality of them only serve to exacerbate the feeling. That there's barely one-hour worth of uninteresting supplements on a Blu-Ray disc is ridiculous.So is the Criterion version of ""Heaven's Gate"" worth a purchase? Well, the movie certainly looks far better than the cruddy MGM disc and it IS a beautiful, if severely flawed, picture - there is a lot of richness in the film to make it a worthy purchase. But ""Heaven's Gate"" is a historical document in cinema (if for the wrong reasons) and it's shameful that Criterion failed to deliver supplements that are not only satisfying, but also provide an impartial outlook on the movie's turbulent history. Comparing Cimino to David Lean is not enough. There was so much they could have added and they chose not to.""Heaven's Gate"" is neither a disaster or a great movie, but it remains a fascinating film to watch and it has never looked better than it does here. But the negligible bonus features and a lack of academic information about the movie makes this one of the most disappointing Blu-Rays ever released by Criterion.Mildly recommended, but only slightly.",2,Box-office bombs have rarely looked this good,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,12297,"['When', 'was', 'announced', 'Criterion', 'would', 'distribute', 'American', 'Blu-Ray', 'release',

149475,A6X6LNZO1C3EZ,0792843584,J. Munyon,"[4, 8]","""Heaven's Gate"" is a 3 hr & 39 min long, at times slow moving saga, based upon a true story of the bloodshed between the cattle barons and the immigrant settlers in Johnson County Wyoming in the 1890's.  The director of this film had been successful directing ""The Deer Hunter"" a year before being given the responsibility of ""Heaven's Gate.""  That is the only similarity between those two movies.  Originally, ""Heaven's Gate"" started out as being 5 hr & 25 min, but when it wasn't given approval, got trimmed down to what it is on this DVD.  Officially released in November of 1980.Kris Kristofferson, Christopher Walken, Isabelle Huppert, Jeff Bridges, John Hurt, Sam Waterston, Brad Dourif, Joseph Cotton, Paul Koslo, Ronnie Hawkins, Tom Noonan, Geoffrey Lewis, Richard Masur, Terry O'Quinn, Mickey Rourke, and William Dafoe star in ""Heaven's Gate.""  The western theme of the time period tries to blend with Harvard University business men, cattle barons, and wealthy land owners, and then European immigrant settlers are added.The movie has enough star power.  Isabella Huppert gets naked and gives us full frontal nudity more than once.  ""Heaven's Gate"" is a confusing title, because I'm not sure what it refers to.  The director wanted to call this film, ""The Johnson County War"" but producers said the name didn't have the right feel to it, and finally all those involved agreed upon ""Heaven's Gate.""  When you watch this film, you know right off, the title change made no difference in the outcome for this movie.  But the real problem for this film was Alexander Hague (serving under the Ronald Reagan administration) advised movie making studios, ""There will be no more films made with a negative view of American history, like `Heaven's Gate.'""Although it meanders far and wide, the movie isn't all that bad, except for the depiction of poverty clashing with wealth.  It is a theme far too many people are personally familiar with, and the outcome doesn't always have to include death to impact that experience.I neither hated nor loved ""Heaven's Gate.""  But if Isabella Huppert wasn't showing off her assets, I doubt if I'd watch this film more than once.  Critics apparently agree, and this movie has been listed among box office failures such as ""Cutthroat Island,"" ""Treasure Planet,"" ""Red Planet,"" ""Gigli,"" ""Ishtar,"" ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,"" ""Catwoman,"" ""Battlefield Earth,"" and ""Waterworld.""  The tastes and interests of people vary as much as flowers in a meadow, therefore you may think ""Heaven's Gate"" is the best movie you've ever seen.  But you can't say so, because the majority of people you tell would say you need to get out more.",3,"Just an average western, unless you've struggled against hardship personally",1294012800,"01 3, 2011",2011,2668,"['Heaven', 'Gate', '3', 'hr', '39', 'min', 'long', 'times', 'slow', 'moving', 'saga', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'bloodshed', 'cattle', 'barons', 'immigrant', 'settlers', 'Johnson', 'County', 'Wyoming', '1890', 'director', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'successful', 'directing', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'year', 'being', 'given', 'responsibility', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'only', 'similarity', 'two', 'movies', 'Originally', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'started', 'out', 'being', '5', 'hr', '25', 'min', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'approval', 'got', 'trimmed', 'down', 'what', 'DVD', 'Officially', 'released', 'November', '1980.Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', 'Paul', 'Koslo', 'Ronnie', 'Hawkins', 'Tom', 'Noonan', 'Geoffrey', 'Lewis', 'Richard', 'Masur', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'William', 'Dafoe', 'star', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'western', 'theme', 'time', 'period', 'tries', 'blend', 'Harvard', 'University', 'business', 'men', 'cattle', 'barons', 'wealthy', 'land', 'owners', 'then', 'European', 'immigrant', 'settlers', 'are', 'added.The', 'movie', 'enough', 'star', 'power', 'Isabella', 'Huppert', 'naked', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'more', 'once', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'confusing', 'title', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'director', 'wanted', 'call', 'film', 'Johnson', 'County', 'War', 'producers', 'said', 'name', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'right', 'feel', 'finally', 'involved', 'agreed', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'When', 'watch', 'film', 'know', 'right', 'off', 'title', 'change', 'made', 'difference', 'outcome', 'movie', 'real', 'problem', 'film', 'was', 'Alexander', 'Hague', 'serving', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'administration', 'advised', 'movie', 'making', 'studios', 'will', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'films', 'made', 'negative', 'view', 'American', 'history', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'far', 'wide', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'depiction', 'poverty', 'clashing', 'wealth', 'theme', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'personally', 'familiar', 'outcome', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'include', 'death', 'impact', 'experience.I', 'neither', 'hated', 'loved', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'Isabella', 'Huppert', 'was', ""n't"", 'showing', 'off', 'assets', 'doubt', ""'d"", 'watch', 'film', 'more', 'once', 'Critics', 'apparently', 'agree', 'movie', 'been', 'listed', 'box', 'office', 'failures', 'such', 'Cutthroat', 'Island', 'Treasure', 'Planet', 'Red', 'Planet', 'Gigli', 'Ishtar', 'Adventures', 'Baron', 'Munchausen', 'Catwoman', 'Battlefield', 'Earth', 'Waterworld', 'tastes', 'interests', 'people', 'vary', 'as', 'much', 'flowers', 'meadow', 'may', 'think', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'so', 'majority', 'people', 'tell', 'would', 'say', 'need', 'get', 'out', 'more']",N/A
149476,A72A8JDQK4D8S,0792843584,John A. Lind,"[5, 5]","Thank goodness for the Criterion Collection Blu-ray restoration of the full 216 minute film that originally premiered in NYC. Technically it brings the video and audio quality up to where it should be for home Blu-ray release.  In general, it allows one to fully appreciate the outstanding cinematography, sweeping vista scenes (reminiscent of some of Davd Lean's work) and sound work.The film was skewered by critics when originally released in 1980, at least some of which was a dog pile precipitated by the industry press coverage about the film's massive overruns in shooting schedule and budget. Even today, too many critics slam films that have production problems because of them and not the final result (The Lone Ranger is an example). United Artists didn't help by pulling it immediately after the NYC premier and having the 216 minute run-time hacked down to 149 minutes for wider release. That left the film with holes; it didn't tell enough of the story. The full 216 minute version isn't perfect, but it's much more cohesive. There are sections that could be a few seconds shorter to pick up the pace slightly. This is mostly near the beginning that sets an environment for the story, but not by much -- a few minutes total cut -- certainly nowhere near an hour. Perhaps among the biggest problems critics had with Heaven's Gate is that it's not a high concept film. They either wanted it to be one or were expecting it to be one, and when it wasn't they dished out their punishment.Approach the film without preconceptions from reviews you might have read or what a western genre film should or should not be. Keep your mind open and look beyond its genre into the narrative and its underlying themes. There is where I believe you'll find the power of the film and the story it tells about wealth, power, privilege and class warfare in the late 19th Century west.",4,"Not the Greatest Western Ever Made, but Quite Far From the Worst",1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,1878,"['Thank', 'goodness', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Blu-ray', 'restoration', 'full', '216', 'minute', 'film', 'originally', 'premiered', 'NYC', 'Technically', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'up', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'home', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'general', 'one', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'outstanding', 'cinematography', 'sweeping', 'vista', 'scenes', 'reminiscent', 'Davd', 'Lean', 'work', 'work.The', 'film', 'was', 'skewered', 'critics', 'when', 'originally', 'released', '1980', 'least', 'was', 'dog', 'pile', 'precipitated', 'industry', 'press', 'coverage', 'film', 'massive', 'overruns', 'shooting', 'schedule', 'budget', 'Even', 'today', 'too', 'many', 'critics', 'slam', 'films', 'have', 'production', 'problems', 'not', 'final', 'result', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'example', 'United', 'Artists', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'pulling', 'immediately', 'NYC', 'premier', 'having', '216', 'minute', 'run-time', 'hacked', 'down', '149', 'minutes', 'wider', 'release', 'left', 'film', 'holes', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'enough', 'story', 'full', '216', 'minute', 'version', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'much', 'more', 'cohesive', 'are', 'sections', 'could', 'be', 'few', 'seconds', 'shorter', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'slightly', 'mostly', 'beginning', 'environment', 'story', 'not', 'much', 'few', 'minutes', 'total', 'cut', 'certainly', 'nowhere', 'hour', 'Perhaps', 'biggest', 'problems', 'critics', 'had', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'not', 'high', 'concept', 'film', 'either', 'wanted', 'be', 'one', 'were', 'expecting', 'be', 'one', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'dished', 'out', 'punishment.Approach', 'film', 'preconceptions', 'reviews', 'might', 'have', 'read', 'what', 'western', 'genre', 'film', 'should', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'Keep', 'mind', 'open', 'look', 'genre', 'narrative', 'underlying', 'themes', 'where', 'believe', ""'ll"", 'find', 'power', 'film', 'story', 'wealth', 'power', 'privilege', 'class', 'warfare', 'late', '19th', 'Century', 'west']",N/A

'This should serve as a warning to any director prone to self-indulgence or producer flipping carte blanche to the film-making wind'.'Heaven's Gate' is the sorest, massivest victim of reputation in movie history. 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' has it as a reference point to unfairly breathe a sigh of relief at. It has historically been more of a victim than the victims portrayed within its vast expanse of celluloid masterpiece. Lambasted, pulled, cut, edited and commercially unrewarding, one thing it seems to have escaped is ridicule. There is a good reason for that but it will take seeing it to fully appreciate why.Cimino was on a roll. Having taxied well up the runway with his Eastwood-cast movies, he climbed to a well and truly dizzying zenith in 'The Deer Hunter'. 'Heaven's Gate' should have been a duplicate in commercial terms.It didn't happen that way. The 'why' element is flustering to mull over. Looking at the correlation between the significance of Vietnam in 1960s America and the Old West in America a century or less beforehand should have been able to keep 'Heaven's Gate' more than salient. Yet, cinema-goers were apathetic in 1980 to something that should have worked, that seriously had worked for them barely two years before.Length shouldn't have had to matter, but that, coupled with the lack of a strong central character seemed to be the blamable factors for 'Heaven's Gate' dying night after night upon theatrical release, before having to be rushed back to the studio hospital for extensive surgery.This truly is a case of 'why-o-why has this happened?!'. The positives are just staggering to behold, after all. Cinematography - perfect. Casting - perfect. Screenplay - (near) perfect.The sum of the parts makes this movie too good to be true. Yet, even in execution, there was still the 'X' factor bestowed by Cimino's careful lens. Reality bled through in every nook and cranny, walked in every foot of so many hundred extras, while comic relief (I mean what else could John Hurt have done but serve as comic relief in this?) and firefighting choreography are through the log cabin roof. The sprawling action evades the need for focus on a solitary protagonist because that's the way it should be. The Johnson County war didn't happen in Hollywood so why should its recreation have?'Heaven's Gate' will be resurrected, though it may take time. Yet, through DVD and video value or deluxe release, late night cable release and large-scale magazine or E-zine reviewing, it shall truly make it back to where it belongs.This type of thing has happened before. It will happen again (rarely, though, given the downplay of the value of auteur cinema largely 'thanks' to this masterpiece). Herzog's 'Nosferatu' was another case of a high-energy attempt coming off looking-good and not quite making it. It's just too bad in this instance because Cimino lost a war in which he'd won every battle.Art House cinema has many Christlike properties. It's a forgiving genre, here to teach us in ways we usually wouldn't dream of looking for or looking through. While it's arguable that the Spaghetti Western was borderline Art House in a few facets, 'Heaven's Gate' stands as the only true example. The gunplay is harrowingly real, the living is heart-wrenchingly real, the dying is virtually intolerable. Maybe that was the problem. The dawn of a new decade didn't want so much social conscience being portrayed and fun-loving cinema patrons seemed to be in tune with that sentiment.Fickle things, movie-goers.",5,Sometimes you can win so much you end up losing.,1078790400,"03 9, 2004",2004,3624,"[""'This"", 'movie', 'sank', 'United', 'Artists', 'movie', 'annihilated', 'Western', ""'This"", 'should', 'serve', 'warning', 'director', 'prone', 'self-indulgence', 'producer', 'flipping', 'carte', 'blanche', 'film-making', 'wind', 'Gate', 'sorest', 'massivest', 'victim', 'reputation', 'movie', 'history', '9', 'Outer', 'Space', 'reference', 'point', 'unfairly', 'breathe', 'sigh', 'relief', 'historically', 'been', 'more', 'victim', 'victims', 'portrayed', 'vast', 'expanse', 'celluloid', 'masterpiece', 'Lambasted', 'pulled', 'cut', 'edited', 'commercially', 'unrewarding', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'escaped', 'ridicule', 'good', 'reason', 'will', 'take', 'seeing', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'why.Cimino', 'was', 'roll', 'Having', 'taxied', 'well', 'runway', 'Eastwood-cast', 'movies', 'climbed', 'well', 'truly', 'dizzying', 'zenith', ""'The"", 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'Gate', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'duplicate', 'commercial', 'terms.It', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'way', ""'why"", 'element', 'flustering', 'mull', 'over', 'Looking', 'correlation', 'significance', 'Vietnam', '1960s', 'America', 'Old', 'West', 'America', 'century', 'less', 'beforehand', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'keep', 'Gate', 'more', 'salient', 'cinema-goers', 'were', 'apathetic', '1980', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'worked', 'seriously', 'had', 'worked', 'barely', 'two', 'years', 'before.Length', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'matter', 'coupled', 'lack', 'strong', 'central', 'character', 'seemed', 'be', 'blamable', 'factors', ""'Heaven"", 'Gate', 'dying', 'night', 'night', 'theatrical', 'release', 'having', 'be', 'rushed', 'back', 'studio', 'hospital', 'extensive', 'surgery.This', 'truly', 'case', ""'why-o-why"", 'happened', 'positives', 'are', 'just', 'staggering', 'behold', 'Cinematography', 'perfect', 'Casting', 'perfect', 'Screenplay', 'perfect.The', 'sum', 'parts', 'movie', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'even', 'execution', 'was', 'still', 'X', 'factor', 'bestowed', 'Cimino', 'careful', 'lens', 'Reality', 'bled', 'nook', 'cranny', 'walked', 'foot', 'so', 'many', 'hundred', 'extras', 'comic', 'relief', 'mean', 'what', 'else', 'could', 'John', 'Hurt', 'have', 'done', 'serve', 'comic', 'relief', 'firefighting', 'choreography', 'are', 'log', 'cabin', 'roof', 'sprawling', 'action', 'need', 'focus', 'solitary', 'protagonist', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'Johnson', 'County', 'war', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Hollywood', 'so', 'why', 'should', 'recreation', 'have', 'Gate', 'will', 'be', 'resurrected', 'may', 'take', 'time', 'DVD', 'video', 'value', 'deluxe', 'release', 'late', 'night', 'cable', 'release', 'large-scale', 'magazine', 'E-zine', 'reviewing', 'shall', 'truly', 'make', 'back', 'where', 'type', 'thing', 'happened', 'will', 'happen', 'again', 'rarely', 'given', 'downplay', 'value', 'auteur', 'cinema', 'largely', 'masterpiece', 'Herzog', ""'Nosferatu"", 'was', 'case', 'high-energy', 'attempt', 'coming', 'off', 'looking-good', 'not', 'quite', 'making', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'instance', 'Cimino', 'lost', 'war', ""'d"", 'won', 'battle.Art', 'House', 'cinema', 'many', 'Christlike', 'properties', 'forgiving', 'genre', 'here', 'teach', 'ways', 'usually', 'would', ""n't"", 'dream', 'looking', 'looking', 'arguable', 'Spaghetti', 'Western', 'was', 'borderline', 'Art', 'House', 'few', 'facets', 'Gate', 'stands', 'only', 'true', 'example', 'gunplay', 'harrowingly', 'real', 'living', 'heart-wrenchingly', 'real', 'dying', 'virtually', 'intolerable', 'Maybe', 'was', 'problem', 'dawn', 'new', 'decade', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'so', 'much', 'social', 'conscience', 'being', 'portrayed', 'fun-loving', 'cinema', 'patrons', 'seemed', 'be', 'tune', 'sentiment.Fickle', 'things', 'movie-goers']",N/A

Running the same length but substantially revised and improved by Cimino for the VHS/CED/Laser versions released in the mid 1980s (and now on DVD)this is probably the version Cimino would have liked to have opened in November 1980.  It's what I would call a flawed masterpiece; a one of kind film made by a director reaching beyond his grasp.  The result is  pure picture making.  To those who say it is too long, or confusing; they should pay a bit more attention.  I've seen the film over 20 times and it becomes a richer experience each time I watch it.  There are no lose ends or editing problems; the issue being style.  As one reviewer wrote in 1980, Cimino chose the lyrical over the narrative.  By the way, the Sunday performance during which I saw it, Vilmos Zsigmond driving up from Phily where he was shooting Blow Out, also attended with his crew.  Once the film was over I heard applause from his section of the theatre.  Gene Siskel was also at that performance having flown in from Chicago to review the film.  As I left the theatre, glancing over I saw him busily jotting down notes.  I guess he was too busy filling out his score card to watch what had been up on that screen.

Every frame seems almost antique, a dazzling combination of sunlit exteriors and naturally lit interiors with candles and oil lamps that give the film a burnish unlike any other.And there's several brillantly directed sequences that are unlike anything in any other film. A hyper-active rollerskating dance that transforms into a waltz between the romantic leads. A massive graduation dance on the lawn of Harvard (actually shot at Oxford) that is breathtaking in its scope.However, all this camerawork and virtuoso editing is wrapped around one of the dullest screenplays ever written. The story is so simple, it could have been covered in 90 minutes instead of 3 hours and 40 minutes, and most of the movie consists of long pensive silences between the actors that lack any kind of dramatic interest or narrative thrust. The movie meanders, wanders, stops dead in its tracks, only occasionally remembering to pick up the storyline and go somewhere with it.Kristofferson is utterly passive and uninteresting.The film spends its first half-hour setting up a friendship between Kristofferson and John Hurt that has no bearing or meaning to to the storyline.The love triangle aspect is contrived and dull.And the victimized immigrants in the film are so shrill, panicky, and annoying that you almost wish they'd get killed.Pictorially, the film is a masterpiece. But as a narrative film, it utterly fails on every level.....never before has so much care gone into making a film with so little substance.As you can tell, this is a very ambivelent review.

149484,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,0792843584,magellan,"[5, 9]","Please note that I saw this on TV so I can't comment on the quality of the video transfer. But it was the ""director's cut"" with the extra footage.I'm easily entertained when it comes to movies, and was prepared to like this film, which chronicles the land wars between the poor immigrant homesteaders and the wealthy cattle ranchers in 1890s Montana, despite all I'd heard about it. But unfortunately I have to say the movie's somnambulistic reputation is well deserved. In fact, the list of the movie's shortcomings reads like a recipe for how to actually make a bad movie, and this from the director of the previous much acclaimed film, The Deerhunter.Yes, this movie really is a turkey, and of truly banquet-sized proportions. If it were a real gobbler, it would feed a family of 12 for a month. As it was, this movie gobbled up United Artists which went bankrupt when the original ten million dollar budget ballooned to almost 40 million (about 100 million in today's dollars) in Cimino's hot hands.First among its defects is the incomprehensible story line, which is disjointed, confusing, and fudges many of the actual historical facts (such as the fact that two of the main characters in the movie were dead by the time the movie's events actually happened). Not being deterred by any semblance to real historical events, Cimino proceeded to film it in brownish, dark sepia tones which looks like it was shot through a wet cow patty. Sepia can certainly give a classy or historic look, sometimes, but then many of the scenes are shot with enough heavy dust or smoke so that you can't see what's going on very well, anyway. All this does is to show great clouds of sepia-toned smoke and dust.Then there is the glacial pacing of the movie, which is about as fast as a horned toad on Quaaludes.*** The sepia color just adds to the overall sluggish, dreary ambience of the movie. Quite honestly, I think the movie would have looked better in a more normal color. Next is the poor quality of the sound track, which pumps up the bass and the treble frequencies but renders incomprehensible the mid-range, which is where most of the actor's voices are--no doubt so that you can't hear the mediocre scipt (which I'll get to in a moment). The result is that you can barely hear the dialog throughout much of the movie. I've heard Edison wax cylinder recordings from a hundred years ago where the voices were more intelligible.The script is about as exciting as the want ads in your local newspaper, and despite the all-star cast, the acting is largely uninspired and uninteresting. Often the actors themselves look like they're painfully aware of just how bad the script is. And as for the title, Heaven's Gate, the only thing heavenly about this movie is how fast the executives at United Artists were probably precipitated to their unearthly reward from early heart attacks when they realized that they had financially destroyed their company by bankrolling this colossal cinematic disaster.We're supposed to empathize with the poor immigrants, but they're portrayed as an obnoxious, churlish lot with about as much charm as a Cockney fishwife (who can at least speak English, in contrast to the people here who seem to be speaking mostly German and Russian--and without subtitles), and who look like the rejects from the famous Mos Eisely Station bar scene in the first Star Wars movie.Lest you think I'm exaggerating about the nonsensical story line, to take just one example, about an hour into the movie there's a scene where Kristofferson's character comes home to his lady friend, who serves him a piece of pie. In the middle of eating his pie, and without any other indication, she suddenly strips off her clothes in the kitchen and dashes for the bedroom. Kristofferson hurriedly gulps down the last couple of bites of his pie while his wife waits impatiently under the covers, and then makes a mad dash for the bedroom himself. Time for the real desert, I guess. LOL. No doubt this scene was unintentionally funny.Shortly after that, the neighbors appear half nekkid at their door, wondering what's going on next door. Then for a little, hard-core realistic dialog, I guess, the mother yells from the front door, ""What the [...] is going on?"" I kid you not. People didn't talk like that in the old west. I expected to start hearing things like, ""Hey dude, how's it hangin'?"" as if it were the Haight-Ashbury ""Summer of Love"" from 1968, but fortunately that was left out--which is about all that was left out of this long, drawn-out, meandering movie.The one saving grace of this movie is the beautiful cinematography of Zigmos Dsigmond, certainly one of the great talents of this period--which is why the two stars instead of one--but unfortunately it's wasted on this self-indulgent, confusing, poorly scripted, poorly acted, overblown, mess of a movie. Run, don't walk, from this movie before the experience brands you like just another ordinary head of cattle.***Steve Hellerstedt's review makes a similar comment--check out this excellent review

If it had received the middle-of-the-road reception it deserved, we'd all have forgotten it by now. But young movie buffs watch it to see if it was really all that awful. And us oldies return to see if we can remember just what the hubbub was all about back in the day. This movie gives us Kris Kristofferson before he ravaged himself and Christopher Walken at the height of his out-of-place ethereal young beauty.  Cimino was obviously a director who appreciated attractive, talented young men with a future; also giving us a young Jeff Bridges and Sam Waterston (pre-Law and Order), John Hurt and Brad Dourif, in addition to an unknown Mickey Rourke in a small part and Willem Dafoe as an undcredited extra.  So, in my latest viewing of this film, I note the disparity between the treatment of men and women by Cimino.  Isabelle Huppert stands out in the only good female part.  But, even though she is playing a working girl, Ms. Huppert is left to look drab and virtually make-up free.  In scenes with both she and Walken the amount of make-up on the already well-dressed Walken reminds one of silent movie cosmetics.  And the scene where Walken takes Kristofferson's hat and eyes himself admiringly in a mirror reinforces one of the ruling errors in the making of this film.  The story is laden down with factual errors typical of the average Western.  Michael Cimino was more interested in displays of male beauty and Western vistas.  Heaven's Gate is a self-indulgent work of art by that helped bring down a studio and, in the long run, hurt thousands of people employed in the film industry by making is harder to get funding to make good films.

You either love it or hate it...there is only black and white when discussing this film. Having just seen the reconstructed director's cut, I will follow that trend and state: ""Heaven's Gate"" is a superior film.I first saw the butchered, approximately 2+ hours version in the theaters several years ago and had to agree that it was pretty bad: incoherent, of course... badly edited...in both sight and sound. At the time it reminded me of those badly made European productions in which every actor is speaking a different language and after the fact, the film is dubbed into Italian or French. The film was literally a mess.In its glorious 3--hours+ state, though, ""HG"" is a pleasure to behold. It is a grand saga dealing with greed, the loss of innocence and how money corrupts...to name a few issues it tackles. It's scope is on the grand scale of such films as Luchino Visconti's ""The Leopard,"" Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in America"" and Bernardo Bertolucci's ""1900."" What makes these films special, thoughtful and important though is that they all tell their stories from the personal perspective of individuals: and ""Heaven's Gate"" does this as well...in the person of Jim Averill (Kris Kristofferson).The film is gorgeous to behold (Vilmos Zsigmond was the photographer) but one big scene bears mentioning: the scene shot in the huge dance hall (actually called Heaven's Gate) in which the entire town is in attendance, everyone roller-skating to fiddle music, several cameras swirling around with the crowd...so involving, so dynamic as to take your breath away. On the other side of the coin the scene with Ella (a young, fresh-faced Isabelle Huppert) and Nate Champion (a rouged and mascara'd, Christopher Walken) in Nate's digs couldn't be sweeter: innocent and personal...Nate brushing off bread crumbs and straightening Ella's place setting on the table, Ella, nervous and jittery...is unforgettable.All of the acting is first-rate but Walken, I think steals the movie with his quirky portrayal of a somewhat fey, yet obnoxiously macho, Nate. In one particular scene, Nate senses that Jim is back in town and tells Ella: ""I can feel when he is around."" In another scene, Nate sneaks into Jim's room and watches a sleeping Jim with, for want of a better word, Desire in his eyes. Nate also picks up and rubs Jim's boot lovingly: interesting, distinctive stuff especially in the context of this great big, masculine film.Isabelle Huppert is also a standout as a Madam, torn between her love for both Jim and Nate and as such is the catalyst for the jealousy and fire in the scenes between Walken and Kristofferson.At the very least, this version of ""Heaven's Gate"" will stand the test of time as a personal and loving statement to a period in America when we began to lose our way and our innocence to boot. At the very most, this version will survive as a testament to how wrong a lot of people can be about a film's worth and importance.

149489,A1XTH5FQRSQTF3,0792843584,michael,"[2, 4]","I viewed this DVD (NOT Blu-Ray) movie for the history of the Johnson County War. I saw either a TV or other movie on the war in the past, read the review, and saw the review referenced Heaven's Gate which was also based upon this war. I looked up the war in the Wikipedia and wished to learned more about it--so I saw the DVD. First, the outdoors photography is fantastic. I have visited the Glacier Park, Montana area and the restored film portrays the outstanding colors. A DVD extra illustrates a side by side comparison of the deterioration of the movie and its restored colors. This was great! The DVD had no subtitle options. Too bad. As other reviews have noted, the sound dialogue is not the best. There is no translation for some of the immigrant's native languages, and I never did figure out why the railway agent was later shot and killed. His accent was also hard to make out when he did speak. Ugh.The war represents an abysmal time in out nation's history, and unfortunately, that history is being repeated today by corporations, our declining middle class, jobs shipped overseas and wage disparities. So from that regard, it is a 30+ year old movie revealing our current economic doldrums.In 1981 I did not see the movie because of the reviews. But then I did not like many of the movies in the early 80s. I give the movie 4 stars because it is a fine movie to watch at home. If I would have gone to the theaters I would have given it three stars, but upped it for 4 as a home movie. Giving this movies 5 stars is out of the question. 5 stars is Academy Award winner or runner up and an all-time movie because of the many elements that make a superior motion picture. This movie, while handsomely shot, and its great attention to detail for the historic period and war which it portrays, has its shortcomings. I would have lost interest in the movie theater on some parts (like the first 30 minutes or so) which has little bearing on the movie.Enjoy the movie with popcorn at home over a night or two!",4,Restoration is Great!

149490,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,0792843584,mirasreviews,"[11, 15]","""Heaven's Gate"" is remembered today as ""the film that sank United Artists"" and one of Hollywood's all-time biggest box office disasters. Written and directed by Michael Cimino shortly after his success with ""The Deer Hunter"", its budget escalated from $7.8 million to over $40 million when UA, in a shockingly shortsighted contract, allowed Cimino unlimited cost overruns. Cimino shot an outrageous 1.3 million feet of film and edited the film to 5 hours and 25 minutes, then to the 3 hour 39 minute version on this DVD for the premiere in November 1980. It was almost universally panned by critics. A 2 1/2 hour cut was widely released to theaters and all but ignored by filmgoers. Michael Cimino's career was essentially over, as was United Artists shortly thereafter.I was prepared to like this film. American critics in 1980 thought that it had no redeeming value. French critics years later praised it to the heavens. I thought the truth might be somewhere in between: a mediocre film that suffers from excessive length. The Americans may have punished the film for Cimino's behavior. The French make a point of loving everything Americans hate. Perhaps the shorter cut that flopped at the box office was too short for the style in which it was filmed. No such luck. When I finally saw ""Heaven's Gate"", it was worse than I expected. In addition to the litany of problems with the film itself, this is a terrible script. If it had not undone United Artists and served as a symbol of artistic self-indulgence, ""Heaven's Gate"" would not be remembered at all.In Johnson County, Wyoming 1892, an organization of wealthy ranchers, the Stock Growers Association, is frustrated with the tide of homesteading immigrants who are poaching their cattle. Under the leadership of the well-connected Frank Canton (Sam Waterson), the Association draws up a death list of 125 homesteaders and hires 50 mercenaries to execute them. Sheriff Jim Averill (Kris Kristofferson) is sympathetic to the plight of the immigrants and tries to ensure the legality of the Association's actions. The Association's foreman Nate Champion (Christopher Walken), a rival of Averill's for the affections of one Ella Watson (Isabelle Huppert), is becoming wary of his employer's violent means. Angry ranchers, desperate immigrants, and all hell is going to break loose.As to the veracity of the events depicted in ""Heaven's Gate"", the Johnson County War really did happen, sort of. The battle between immigrants and mercenaries employed by the Stock Growers Association was averted before it could take place. Many of the characters in the film take their names from real people: Ella Watson, Jim Averill, Frank Canton, Nate Champion, W.C. Irvine. But the roles they play in the film are entirely different from those in reality. Watson and Averill were dead by 1892. So the film is fictional except for the general circumstances of the conflict in Johnson County.""Heaven's Gate"" consists of scenes that run too long and scenes whose purpose is mysterious. There is just a lot of footage that doesn't accomplish much. The dialogue is corny and cliched. One major fault is that the film fails to make the immigrants sympathetic. They are an unruly cabal of hot-headed peasants whom we never know and certainly never like. Another failure is that Jim Averill is entirely opaque. We don't have any idea why he is in Wyoming or why he does anything. I can't imagine why Canton is hauling Billy Irvine, a drunken thorn in his side, around with him either. Actually, I don't know why Irvine is in the movie. This film is just like that. It doesn't make sense.When people can't find anything else good to say about ""Heaven's Gate"", they praise Zigmos Dsigmond's cinematography. He is one of the great talents of his era. This film is in color but almost sepia-toned, so brown is the predominant color. In the print that I saw, the brown had an unwelcome pink undertone. I don't know if it's a problem with the transfer or if the film really looked like that. There is much artistic rendering of dust or, less commonly, smoke. For 3 hours, I wondered how Zigmos Dsigmond kept the dust out of his camera. There is no denying that Dsigmond's photography looks good if I ignore the pink. (The pink was bad judgment if it was intentional.) But this isn't his best work, and it is very self-conscious at times.Whatever its faults -and they are many- ""Heaven's Gate"" ultimately fails because no one or thing in the film is compelling. It has compelling moments, but they are fleeting. Each time I saw one, I hoped the film would take off from there. It never happened. This is basically 3 3/4 hours of texture. A script with bad dialogue, nebulous characters, and actions without motivation should never have been green-lighted. In his book ""Final Cut"", Stephen Bach, who was one of UA's heads of production, places blame for the film mostly on Michael Cimino. I don't dispute that, but Cimino wouldn't have had the opportunity to run amok if Bach had not liked this lousy script. The only bonus feature on the MGM 2000 DVD is a theatrical trailer (1 min).

149495,A2WHH346Y9ADRG,0792843584,M. S. Driver,"[4, 6]","Heaven's Gate has been unfairly stigmatized by the circumstances of its creation.  According to a documentary aired in a TRIO channel series called FLOPS, the film was done in by Michael Cimino's ambition to create a new &quot;Gone with the Wind.&quot;  What he created, however, was an exciting, ravishingly beautiful art film whose natural audience was much, much smaller than what the studio needed to recoup its expenses.  Some reviewers say that the story was confusing, but I was able to follow it and was quite gripped by it, even though the pacing was slow and it did not spell out the plot details or give obvious clues for the audience in the usual way of Hollywood movies.  I thought this was rather a compliment to my intelligence.  Cimino's obsessive attention to detail -- the ultimate reason for the cost overruns that killed United Artists -- really paid off for this viewer, who loved the authenticity, the sense of being drawn back into another time (although Isabelle Huppert was too modern-looking for her role).

149499,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,0792843584,Only-A-Child,"[12, 20]","You have to acknowledge Cimino's contribution to cinema. He gave us both the most over-rated film in history (The Deer Hunter) and the worst film in history (Heaven's Gate)- although I give it a second star for visuals. .For 20+ years I listened to the critics and avoided ""Heaven's Gate""-actually this was not hard because you are hardly bombarded with opportunities to view this film. Then a few days after seeing the documentary: 'Final Cut: The Making and Unmaking of Heaven's Gate', I stumbled on a used $9.99 DVD of the long version. My advice after 229 minutes is to seek out the most negative review ever written about this film (you will find a wide selection), and imagine that the reviewer is Cimino's devoted mother and that she is doing everything she can to put a positive slant on her dear son's movie. Then you will have an idea of just how big a mess Cimino made.  If that is not enough here are some descriptions of Dennis Hopper's ""The Last Movie"" which are equally applicable to Cimino: ""gaseous and overblown mess, puerile, it is narcissistic but not introspective, self-gratification, overwhelming egotism, an extravagant mess, inflated pretensions, an embarrassment, an endless, chaotic, suffocating, acid-soaked movie, the work of a kid playing with a toy"".While pretty much everything is wrong with this film, what ultimately tips the scale to make it the worse ever (and a classic 'less than zero' example) is its shameless distortion of history. Although the cattlemen's association did send a group of regulators/gunmen to Johnson County and did have a list of targeted names, the actual facts of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated. On the morning of April 9, 1892, Nick Ray and Nate Champion were besieged and eventually killed by an army of about 50 cattlemen and Texas hired guns who had come to Johnson County to clean out ""rustlers."" The citizens of the county then besieged the regulators who finally were arrested (or rescued) by the Army. Women did not actively participate in the fighting and aside from Ray and Champion there were minimal casualties. After all, these were sieges not assaults-and there were not wagons of immigrants riding in circles around the encampment of regulations (early westerns to the contrary this was a film making device and not an actual tactic of the Indians). And weeks prior to the arrival of the regulators a number of Johnson County residents were hanged without trial including Jim Averell, the keeper of a modest road ranch, and his wife Ella Watson (who Cimino resurrects as his two leads and he even shows Averell living to a ripe old age).There is no movie-making sin greater than fictionalizing history, if you are going to play fast and loose with historical facts, then change the names and locations to protect the unsuspecting audience members who might go away from a film believing what they saw actually happened. Fortunately so few people saw this film that the damage was minimal. Perhaps it is harsh to blame Cimino for his distortion of history. He could probably escape blame anyway with an insanity defense-the film provides plenty of support. If Cimino was insane during the production of Heaven's Gate it would explain a lot of things. But my vote goes to 'lack of directing talent' instead of insanity.There are some good things about Heaven's Gate. You can actually see on the screen where some of the huge budget went; expensive sets-beautiful epic camera shots-artful dance sequences. Isabelle Huppert (a strange casting choice that actually worked) gives an agreeable and likable performance although most of her scenes are extremely boring (that tends to happen when the director forgets to give the viewer any reason to care about the characters). The dialogue is generally solid if rather ordinary.But don't fall for the crap that this film experiments with storytelling by intermixing carefully crafted moments of character interaction with textured pageant-like explosions of communal action. This implies that there was a method to Cimino madness. 'Experiments' is another word for when a filmmaker gets so lost in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible. The simple fact is that there is no evidence Cimino storyboarded a single scene or made any attempt at control or organization. What it looks like is that he just turned his DP loose to stage action and to get an endless selection of colorful shots-1.5 million feet of loosely staged scenes. Then he tried (without success) to pare this down and fit everything together in post-production.The final battle scene is genuinely hilarious as babushka wearing townswomen (perhaps borrowed from a 'Fiddler On The Roof' touring company) throw countless sticks of dynamite at the regulators. Unfortunately each explosive falls just short of the target and explodes harmlessly. After you see this happen 50-60 times you can relate to the woman (the one who looks like something out of 'The Grapes of Wrath') who puts a huge gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger. This is probably what Cimino's mother did after writing that review.So believe what you have been hearing about this film since 1980. It is a sloppy, disconnected, poorly paced, and historically distorted mess. Of value only as a 'how not to make a film' example for film historians and as a source of amusement to those knowledgeable about the actual history of the American west.Then again, what do I know?

Back 31-years ago, it's hard to figure what exactly just what went wrong, but here goes:  bad script, bad screenplay, bad directing, bad editing.  What a long, boring film!  The incidental scenes were totally unnecessary; and added NOTHING to the film as a whole.  The whole thing could have been accomplished as a 30-minute short story, and that is problematic for the whole effect.  Just how long does it take to walk through a door?...or to put on a jacket?...or to mount a horse?...or to open a bottle?  The incidentals are what KILL this film.  I know in the '70's, that realism was the key to good directing and production; but one can watch and appreciate only so much 'realism' in a film, in a story, without wanting it to be concluded.  Christopher Walken looks like a 'martian' and will ALWAYS look like a martian.  He was the WRONG choice for Nate Champion.  AS for the rest of the cast, anyone could have pulled it off easily.

149501,A30I207MIU383O,0792843584,"Phillip E. Hardy ""Phillip E. Hardy""","[6, 8]","During the fall of 1980, I was looking forward to the release of Michael Cimino's epic ""Heaven's Gate"", a story about the Johnson County War, an obscure piece of American History. As a huge fan of ""The Deer Hunter"", I was disappointed and felt cheated when this costly western was pulled from its original release date after critics annihilated the director's cut. When I saw the trimmed version of the film some 24 years ago, I was less than thrilled. With a newly critical eye, I just watched the DVD version, which has a run time of 3 hours and 39 minutes. Though the film still falters under the weight of its ambitious scope, the spectacular photography by Vilmos Zsigond is peerless and there are many scenes that were brilliantly directed. However, other parts including the Harvard Commencement sequence at the beginning of the film are interminable and should have been trimmed with a chainsaw. The much debated and historically inaccurate story is about wealthy Wyoming cattlemen assembling a death list of 125 immigrants they deem as ""thieves and anarchists"". Kris Kristofferson plays Marshall Jim Averill, who the audience first sees as a twenty something Harvard graduate with a life promise looming on the horizon. The story fast forwards two decades to a scenic Wyoming backdrop, where a disenchanted and burned out Averill uncovers the evil plans of the aristocratic cattlemen's association, drinks excessively and rekindles an on going relationship with a lovely prostitute named Ella Watson (played by French actress Isabelle Huppert). Also competing for the affections of Watson is hired assassin Nate Champion (played by a young Christopher Walken). Though interesting immigrant characters are introduced, they are not developed and we never truly understand why protagonist Averill has become cynical at the ripe old age of forty. Other plot elements and character motivations including Champion going from cold blooded killer to soft hearted suitor are confusing and countless other scenes including a painful rape sequence are overlong. In spite of some very solid scenes, the viewer wonders if Cimino ever heard of the term film editing. Either that or he fell desperately in love with his own work, originally submitting a five hour plus version to studio executives. The climatic battle sequence between the poor settlers and hired killers is ambitious, extremely violent and ultimately falls flat, leaving the viewer feeling it was pointless. Not because violence begets more violence and resolves nothing. To the contrary, it is futile because we are not allowed to care enough about any of the characters who the director keeps at a distance. I can see that Cimino painstakingly endeavored to create a masterpiece and on a visual level he was partially successful. The story telling is where the director fails to hit the mark. The supposed plot of the grasping upper class inflicting oppression and murder upon the poor settlers seems only to serve as a convoluted pathway to illustrate a life misspent by protagonist Averill. By the end of the movie, the audience has witnessed an extraordinary carnage of practically every other character in the film. This only to see rich man Averill sailing on his yacht and lamenting his pointless existence; ultimately married to a Harvard class beauty introduced only briefly at the beginning of the movie. Again this bizarre existential payoff is apparently supposed to justify to the audience why money and beauty cannot buy happiness.

I have tried to make it past the first hour many times, and just barely made it past the third as of recently. It wasn't easy- good thing I had a pot of coffee nearby.2. I absolutely hated the Deer Hunter. Thought it was complete garbage as with any Michael Cimino film.3. I believe anyone who has sit through even 5 minutes of this cinematic abortion deserves a big cheque from Cimino himself as an apology.Don't listen to the people who call this film a masterpiece. I don't know what they're snorting, and I certainly don't want any of it, especially if it dumbs them down enough to make them call this film a masterpiece.Don't get me started on how long each scene is. The 20 minute dance scene in the beginning will make you go ""OK is it done yet????"". Or the 5 minute shots of people staring off into the distance. I don't mind movies starting off slowly, as long as the time is spent to set the tone. I'll mention Inglourious Basterds here- the opening scene is 20 minutes long and consists of a conversation at a table between a Nazi and a Jew. However, it's there for a reason. It's a scene in which miss a single line of dialogue, and you will not get the film. It does an excellent job at setting the tone and having the audience on the edge of their seat.To say this movie moves at a slow pace is really wrong- it doesn't move at any pace at all. It just sits on its arse and expects the audience to help it move. That's not to say that nothing happens, because plenty happens- too bad only 10 minutes of it are actual content. There's a difference between epicness and length. The entire dialogue could fit onto maybe 3 sheets of paper, and back to back too. And whatever dialogue was there, it wasn't even interesting at all.The movie even looks like crap too. Half the film is shot in Sepia- this takes 2 seconds to get annoying, and by the third hour, it you'll be needing to see an eye doctor. This is just a horrible film, and one that should be avoided.

149507,A19HDQR569CG8A,0792843584,R. Kevin Hill,"[3, 5]","[spoilers] This is not a masterpiece, nor is it the worst film ever made. However, some guidance may be necessary. Much of the complaining is about getting lost watching it, having no idea what's going on. A simple piece of advice: pretend it's a European art film, i.e. supposed to be slow, and impossible to understand without subtitles. Subtitles make a *huge* difference. Second, it helps to know something about Marxism, since the narrative is constructed around the idea of class determinism and that even the exploiting class warps its own humanity and cannot achieve fulfillment as long as it exploits. The theme of the film, then, is, the West promised to be a place where people could escape from their class background as exploiter or exploited and find fulfillment, but this was an illusion: ultimately the peasants who sought escape are put down and massacred, and the Harvard man who sought escape fails in his new Western role as lawman and has to go back East and return to his status as bloodless exploiter. Hence the college scene in the beginning and the boat scene in the end. So yes, it does all make sense, ultimately. The characters are Big Abstractions: the woman who tries to escape from the traditional woman's role by becoming a businesswoman (a madam) only to find that patriarchy won't accept this - she's raped and murdered. The immigrant (Christopher Walken) who hopes to be accepted by the ruling class by doing its bidding, only to find, tragically, that he can't find love and freedom that way, and when he tries to have it all, is destroyed by his own contradictions. The man who wants to represent the ideals of Law, only to discover that social conflicts are not *under* Law, but that Law is ultimately just a tool of, you guessed it, the ruling class. The problem with the film is twofold. First, assuming you get the theme, it's pretty heavy-handed, dogmatic, simplistic. Second, the writing is weak: we are led to believe that the characters represent these various types, and that therefore their actions are Important, but they are given far too little to do to demonstrate it. Averill never asserts the claims of Law forcefully enough, and never gets thwarted strikingly enough, to make his transformation at the end from lawman to revolutionary leader plausible or interesting. It's not that Kristofferson's performance is inadequate, it's that he's not given enough to DO. This is true for everyone in the film. There is a plot: the bad ranchers are going to kill to the good rustlers, the rustlers will fight back, but they will fail. But all the movement is just people (and thus the audience) waiting for this to happen, for the most part. More subplots, with more choices leading to more situations, etc. etc. woven into that main action, was what was needed. In short, a writer other than the director (this seems to be a mistake great directors are prone to, trying to do their own writing: witness Coppola's recent promiing-but-flawed work). Also: Reluctantly, I concede that the claims about the cinematography are fair: the sepia tone in the original was excessive. This, however, has been corrected in the Criterion version, and with all the brown wiped away, the imagery *is* stunning. So: watch the Criterion version, think Marxism, use subtitles, split it into two evenings, and enjoy the stunning imagery. It's not going to be a perfect film, but it's one of the important American auteur films of (made in) the late 70s, like the Godfathers, Apocalypse Now, Chinatown, and is worth a look. I understand the temptation some feel to praise it to the skies to make up for the grotesquely unfair negative reviews it's received, but while this was an attempt to equal those just mentioned films, it never really lives up to its promise.

149508,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0792843584,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 7]","Heaven's Gate (Michael Cimino, 1980)I have a working hypothesis that the more the general public hates a movie-- truly, in its collective heart of hearts, despises it-- the less that movie deserves it. After all, the general public's lack of filmgoing taste is supremely well-documented; the Lifetime Movie Network is a major advertising draw these days, and somehow Joel Schumacher continues to get work, despite not having made a watchable movie since 1990 or so. (And, well, two words: Warren Beatty.) The most recent movie with which I put this hypothesis to the test was Michael Cimino's universally loathed Heaven's Gate, widely known as ""that incoherent western that bankrupted United Artists."" And, once again, the hypothesis gets a bit of weight added to it; while Cimino's film is, in places, incoherent, and did, in fact, send United Artists into the toilet, it's a fine-looking little epic that has a lot more going for it than most of what's passed for ""action films"" in the quarter-century since its release.Heaven's Gate is Cimino's retelling of the Johnson County War, a particularly galling event in American history. We see it from multiple points of view, but the center of all the tales is James Averill (Kris Kristofferson). We see him first graduating from Harvard with his friend Billy Irvine (John Hurt), in an extended scene cut from the theatrical release, then cut to fifteen years later, when the two find themselves on opposite sides of the burgeoning conflict in Wyoming-- Irvine as a member of the landowner's association, backed up by the President, who desire the removal of hundreds of immigrants from the frontier, and Averill living amongst them, a previous member of the Landowner's Association who's been removed from his position and now wishes simply to live in obscurity, if relative wealth, among his community.It's a long movie, there's no doubt about it, and one wonders, having seen the three-and-a-half hour version and knowing there's a version that's two hours longer in a vault somewhere, how much of the movie's current incoherence (which must have been far worse in the two-hour theatrical release) would be eliminated by seeing the full version of the film. Hollywood seems to have a big problem with movies that go over two hours, despite having seen over and over that big epics can do amazingly well at the box office (The Longest Day was, of course, longer than the directors' cut of Heaven's Gate, and Dances with Wolves wasn't much shorter). So we end up with, well, incoherent westerns that bankrupt United Artists. Doesn't that kind of gall you? After all, this is Hollywood saying that you don't have the attention span to watch an intelligent, complex film that's longer than two hours. (But watching Kevin Costner run around in the woods for four hours, it seems, is vacuous enough to get past everyone.) And I'm here to tell you that Heaven's Gate is an intelligent, complex film, one that's well worth watching, even in this abbreviated three-and-a-half hour form.

First the male leads: Kris Kristofferson, Christopher Walken and John Hurst (all at their peak) and the conflicted admiration and respect they have for each other.  Add to those, Sam Waterston, as the cattle baron who despises the immigrates because they are poor and butcher a steer or two to feed their starving families, and Jeff Bridges the inn keeper, another friend of Kristofferson's James Averill.Consider the grandeur of the film, which begins with Averill 's attendance of a graduation speech given my Joseph Cotton, Harvard Dean.  It took me several viewings to notice that his speech presents the central theme of the movie (idealism and the taming of the lawless West, because Cimino purposely distracts the viewer with cuts to the antics of John Hurst who makes fun of the seriousness of the speech.  This is followed by a scene of the graduation dance comprised of scores of extras in nineteenth-century suits and gowns waltzing in Harvard Yard (actually Oxford), which ends with a riotous free for all as the men beat each other as they scramble for the ladies bouquets atop a tree in the year.  The theme of beauty vs. violence, which also underlies the movie.And there is much spectacle to come:  poor immigrants perched atop empty train cars as the locomotive steam engulfs them as it trails backward.Then there is the greatest set piece in the movie, the roller skating rink where the immigrants circle while a Cajun band plays, ending with a solo waltz for JamesAverill and Ella Watson, the town Madam played by the young and gorgeous Isabelle Huppert.All the while, a gang of bounty hunters hired and armed by the cattlemen is on its way with a list of immigrants, including Emma and most of the townspeople, to be shot on sight.I know why this movie didn't find an audience.

One is reminded of early Russian classics, of Godard and Antonioni, and perhaps mosty tellingly of Renoir in the detail of observation of the period.

Until the release of Ishtar, this depiction of the Johnson County War in the late 19th Century enjoyed the dubious distinction of being the biggest box office flop of all time.  In my view, however, a box office flop doesn't necessarily denote a bad movie.  A bad movie is one with low production values, bad effects, and/or muddled script, like Plan 9 From Outer Space or Manos: The Hands of Fate.  Heaven's Gate, though it may have been a box office flop, is actually a very good movie that got it's undeserved reputation due to director Michael Cimino's obsession with perfection.  This resulted in multiple takes of scenes that most directors could have shot in one or two.  Ultimately, the picture cost three or four times its original budget to make.  Negative pre-release publicity from a reporter who managed to get into the film as an extra after Cimino refused to grant him an interview, and the critical shellacking that it received from the critics when released, conspired with the well reported cost overruns to doom Heaven's Gate before it was even out of the starting gate.Personally, I like this movie.  And while I appreciate Cimino's insistence on period authenticity in such things as trains, costuming and sets but I have a problem reconciling it to a script that takes such artistic liberties with recorded history.  The real Jim Averill was a cattle ruster who along with his wife was hanged.  He was not the noble sheriff with an Ivy League background as portrayed in the film by Kris Kristofferson.  Nevertheless, Heaven's Gate is a superb motion picture in many respects.  The cinematography by Villnos Zsigmond is nothing short of magnificent, and the acting performances are all good, especially those of Kristofferson, John Hurt, and Christopher Walken.  Although many previous reviewers have criticized the sound quality, I found nothing wrong with it.  I also didn't find the plot all that hard to follow, as others claim.  Perhaps they expected the movie to give them a clue without any sort of thinking on their own.  Of all the complaints that have been levelled against Heaven's Gate, the only one I think that has any merit to it is that the pacing is painfully slow.  That said, I don't believe it distracts significantly from the enjoyment of the movie.  Incidentally, have I mentioned that David Mansfield's score (sadly, not in print) is beautiful?Sure, Heaven's Gate is considered to be a flop.

149523,AN1YBZJFBCGMK,0792843584,"S. Organ ""Filly Film Fan""","[33, 41]","It is difficult to watch Heaven's Gate without being fully aware of the film's history.  It was the film that brought down a studio; it is the worst film ever made; it was a film made by an egomaniac director completely out of control; it is a complete and incoherent mess.  And, as with many film legends, many of these claims are made by people who have never seen it. So, whenever one sits down to watch this 3 hour 40 minute epic, you cannot help but view the film through these prisms.The current version of the film available on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD claims to be Cimino's original cut of the film, though that is hard to prove given that the 3+ hour version was never officially released.  Studio heads panicked and yanked that version several days before the opening, demanding Cimino recut it to a shorter length. Apparently, this version available on video was ""found"" by the studio and released because of the enormous curiosity and history of the production.  There has been no formal declaration that this version IS the final cut that Cimino had planned to release.Is the film as bad as everyone says?  The film that is available on video does has its problems.  The audio mix is atrocious with much of the dialogue being lost in the mix of ambient sound.  The opening sequence, though well executed, is totally unnecessary.  The pacing of the first 40 minutes is slow, confusing, and a mishmash of scenes that the viewer is left to figure out its importance and meaning. The lead actor and the film's anchor, Kris Kristoferson, turns in a boring, leaden, one-note performance that further hampers the film.But the film also has much going for it.  The cinematography, always singled out as a highlight, is truly astonishing. Combined with the meticulous and accurate production work of the sets and costumes, the film has the unmistakable look and feel of being shot in the late 1890's. It has a compelling storyline that deals with the issue of immigration in a fresh and controversial way.  The performances of the actors, in particular Hubert and Waterston, are excellent and go a long way in compensating for several weakly scripted scenes.  And the music of David Mansfield is note-perfect.  So when these elements are combined--as they are many times throughout--the film is very impressive, engaging, and shows enormous promise.Where the film truly suffers is in the editing.  I saw the original 2 1/2 version several times during its release, though it was not much better overall (it felt too short!), the storyline was clearer and there were a couple of expository moments that this version lacks.  One could easily trim down the first hour to an improved, clearer, and better paced 30 minutes. It is the lack of structure that really injures this version. One almost gets the sense that the film is still in its rough-cut stage and is about 2 - 3 versions away from a finished product.The DVD release is a huge disappointment.  The master is taken from the laserdisc version and suffers an enormous loss of clarity.  Because of this, viewers are only given a letterboxed version and not the preferred 16x9 presentation that this widescreen presentation deserves.  The audio, though stating it is 5.1, is bland and muddled and demonstrates no delineation between front and rear.  What is even more frustrating is that many of the Polish scenes lack proper subtitles, so the viewer has no idea what is being spoken.  (There is no English subtitle track either.)It is difficult to recommend this film to family or friends as you will never know what will be the reaction.  If you are patient and understand that this is not a final version, then you are more forgiving of its faults and can enjoy many of its excellent moments.  On the other hand, if you are expecting to see the Worst Film Ever Made, you have much that will prove that theory.  It all depends from which prism you choose to view the film.",3,Is it really that bad?,1036281600,"11 3, 2002",2002,3931,"['difficult', 'watch', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'being', 'fully', 'aware', 'film', 'history', 'was', 'film', 'brought', 'down', 'studio', 'worst', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'was', 'film', 'made', 'egomaniac', 'director', 'completely', 'control', 'complete', 'incoherent', 'mess', 'many', 'film', 'legends', 'many', 'claims', 'are', 'made', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'So', 'whenever', 'one', 'down', 'watch', '3', 'hour', '40', 'minute', 'epic', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'view', 'film', 'prisms.The', 'current', 'version', 'film', 'available', 'VHS', 'Laserdisc', 'DVD', 'claims', 'be', 'Cimino', 'original', 'cut', 'film', 'hard', 'prove', 'given', '3+', 'hour', 'version', 'was', 'never', 'officially', 'released', 'Studio', 'heads', 'panicked', 'yanked', 'version', 'several', 'days', 'opening', 'demanding', 'Cimino', 'recut', 'shorter', 'length', 'Apparently', 'version', 'available', 'video', 'was', 'found', 'studio', 'released', 'enormous', 'curiosity', 'history', 'production', 'been', 'formal', 'declaration', 'version', 'final', 'cut', 'Cimino', 'had', 'planned', 'release.Is', 'film', 'as', 'bad', 'everyone', 'film', 'available', 'video', 'problems', 'audio', 'mix', 'atrocious', 'much', 'dialogue', 'being', 'lost', 'mix', 'ambient', 'sound', 'opening', 'sequence', 'though', 'well', 'executed', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'pacing', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'slow', 'confusing', 'mishmash', 'scenes', 'viewer', 'left', 'figure', 'out', 'importance', 'meaning', 'lead', 'actor', 'film', 'anchor', 'Kris', 'Kristoferson', 'boring', 'leaden', 'one-note', 'performance', 'further', 'hampers', 'film.But', 'film', 'also', 'much', 'going', 'cinematography', 'always', 'singled', 'out', 'highlight', 'truly', 'astonishing', 'Combined', 'meticulous', 'accurate', 'production', 'work', 'sets', 'costumes', 'film', 'unmistakable', 'look', 'feel', 'being', 'shot', 'late', '1890', 'compelling', 'storyline', 'deals', 'issue', 'immigration', 'fresh', 'controversial', 'way', 'performances', 'actors', 'particular', 'Hubert', 'Waterston', 'are', 'excellent', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'compensating', 'several', 'weakly', 'scripted', 'scenes', 'music', 'David', 'Mansfield', 'note-perfect', 'So', 'when', 'elements', 'are', 'combined', 'are', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'very', 'impressive', 'engaging', 'enormous', 'promise.Where', 'film', 'truly', 'suffers', 'editing', 'saw', 'original', '2', '1/2', 'version', 'several', 'times', 'release', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'overall', 'felt', 'too', 'short', 'storyline', 'was', 'clearer', 'were', 'couple', 'expository', 'moments', 'version', 'One', 'could', 'easily', 'trim', 'down', 'first', 'hour', 'improved', 'clearer', 'better', 'paced', '30', 'minutes', 'lack', 'structure', 'really', 'version', 'One', 'almost', 'sense', 'film', 'still', 'rough-cut', 'stage', 'about', '2', '3', 'versions', 'away', 'finished', 'product.The', 'DVD', 'release', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'master', 'taken', 'laserdisc', 'version', 'suffers', 'enormous', 'loss', 'clarity', 'viewers', 'are', 'only', 'given', 'letterboxed', 'version', 'not', 'preferred', '16x9', 'presentation', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'deserves', 'audio', 'stating', '5.1', 'bland', 'muddled', 'delineation', 'front', 'rear', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'frustrating', 'many', 'Polish', 'scenes', 'lack', 'proper', 'subtitles', 'viewer', 'idea', 'what', 'being', 'spoken', 'English', 'subtitle', 'track', 'difficult', 'recommend', 'film', 'family', 'friends', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'reaction', 'are', 'patient', 'understand', 'not', 'final', 'version', 'then', 'are', 'more', 'forgiving', 'faults', 'can', 'enjoy', 'many', 'excellent', 'moments', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'expecting', 'see', 'Worst', 'Film', 'Ever', 'Made', 'have', 'much', 'will', 'prove', 'theory', 'prism', 'choose', 'view', 'film']",N/A
149524,AT07UZQQR7ZEH,0792843584,"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[177, 198]","1980 marks the 25th anniversary of one of the strangest media events ever.  There was an eagerly-awaited invitational preview on a Thursday for a four hour Michael Cimino western called HEAVEN'S GATE.  The whole industry came out in force to see Cimino's first movie since his Oscar-winning THE DEER HUNTER (1978) and, at a budget of $40 million, a movie that had bankrupt United Artists.  The result was apparently an unholy disaster-so awful that Friday opening day regular engagements were abruptly cancelled.  Reviews were venomous, focusing much more on the hefty budget and how an arrogant auteur filmmaker had brought down a studio with his excesses.  Roger Ebert was particularly hostile.  The 219 minute movie was sent back to the editing room with Cimino and several original editors.  In mid-1981, an all-new HEAVEN'S GATE was brought out at only 149 minutes.  The same hostile reviewers, except for Kevin Thomas in THE LOS ANGELES TIMES, still hated the movie for being too long and not having a coherent story.  I saw that shortned print, adored the movie, and sent a rave review to Mr. Cimino.  I got a very positive thank you letter from the filmmaker himself saying it was a hit in France.  In America, I think the 149 minute print played for only two weeks in deserted theaters.  Just for good luck, animal rights groups who had not seen the movie in any form were protesting the mistreatment of horses in the film.Thank God for home video!  While heavily censored TV prints of HEAVEN'S GATE still run 149 minutes, the uncut 219 minute roadshow version (which importantly never got a theatrical run for the general public) is available on letterboxed videocassette and DVD.  Let us wish it a Happy 25th Birthday, forget all budget problems, and just evaluate what is up on the screen for 219 minutes.According to writer/director Cimino, the Johnson County War took place in 1892 Casper, Wyoming.  It was a battle waged between Eastern European immigrants and American cattlemen.  The cattlemen, led by a despicable villain named Canton (Sam Waterston at his nastiest), claimed that the immigrants were stealing cattle and land in exchange for sexual favors in a local whorehouse run by Ella Watson (Isabelle Huppert).  Acting under authority of the President and Federal Government, Canton and his Cattlemen's Association came up with a death list with 125 immigrant names on it, including Ella.  The movie's central protagonist is marshall Jim Averill (Kris Kristofferson in the performance of his career), who is in love with Ella.  So is a bounty hunter named Nate Campion (Christopher Walken).  How can the critics say there is no story here?!  There is a passionate and romantic love triangle wrapped inside a powerful western conflict. As God is my witness, the uncut HEAVEN'S GATE is my favorite western of the last 25 years-yes, including Best Picture Oscar winners UNFORGIVEN (1992) and DANCES WITH WOLVES (1990), which are admittedly very good adult westerns also.I have no idea what HEAVEN'S alleged $40 million budget would be in 2005 dollars.  Probably $80 million, which is hefty, but not unreasonable for a four hour period western meticulously shot on location on magnificent Idaho and Montana locations.  An entire frontier town (Casper?) was built in Kalispell, Montana.  A working antique train was brought to the location.  Nothing was too good for the genius who had won Oscars for THE DEER HUNTER only two years before.  The movie's art direction got a 1981 Oscar nomination.  The dusty sepia Panavision photography, by Vilmos Zsigmond, captures the look of antique photos.  There were horse wranglers for dozens of horses, dance and skating instructors (for an exquisite extended ""Blue Danube Waltz"" at Harvard at the beginning and a memorable roller skating scene in the film's middle).  David Mansfield's fiddle and mandolin score is unforgettably beautiful and haunting throughout, especially when ""The Blue Danube Waltz"" becomes a slow motion dirge during the latter battle scenes.  The climactic battle is violent and seems to go on as long as the real 1892 cattlemen/immigrants battle.  It is a horrible and beautiful sustained sequence--maybe lasting an hour of screen time--that is severely shortened in the cut TV print.  This is one gorgeous piece of filmmaking by a master who admittedly let the movie get away from him.  It IS too long and IS too pessimistic.  But at least you can see where the money went. It is a true labor of love movie that, ironically, may be Cimino's finest films.  I don't think it is quite as great as THE DEER HUNTER, but certainly it is better than Cimino's modestly budgeted subsequent films.(PLOT SPOILERS-BEWARE!)  It is impossible to discuss why I love the uncut HEAVEN'S GATE so much without discussing the 20 minute Prologue and five minute Epilogue.  So many critics call these scenes extraneous and confused, but they are the very heart of the movie for me. The Prologue takes place at 1870 Harvard with Jim Averill as a young student in love with a young woman he is frustratingly too shy to talk to; they exchange smiles.  Averill is haunted by this beautiful young woman all his life, as I am by a married young woman I loved at UCLA long ago and cannot get out of my mind.  Joseph Cotten has a cameo as a head professor, and John Hurt is the class orator.  Look at the end credits.  Writer Cimino really did his homework-these are real speeches being spoken.  And the dance on Harvard lawn, a lengthy and enthralling ""Blue Danube Waltz"", may be one of the American cinema's loveliest set pieces.  Shockingly, it is sometimes cut for time on TV showings, instead of the overlong battle much later.The Epilogue is the key to the whole movie for me.  Study it.  (PLOT SPOILER ALERT!)  It is 1903, and Jim Averill is the sole survivor of the bloody Johnson County War.  I won't tell you how or where Nate and Ella die.  We are on a yacht off Newport, Rhode Island at sunset.  Averill is below deck with a young woman.  He has finally married at least a surrogate for the girl of his dreams from Harvard long ago and is still deeply unhappy. He lights a cigarette for his presumed wife, while staring off into space, lost in his dreams of the past.  He walks back up on deck for one of the most beautiful final shots in the American cinema of the 1980's. (Beware of an old VHS tape version that omits this final scene and freezes on Jim below deck!)  And Mansfield's music, as always, is incomparable.So, the majestic and magnificent HEAVEN'S GATE, in its uncut 219 minute form at least, is a portrait of the entire lifetime of  Jim Averill, from Harvard youth in 1870, to Wyoming marshall in 1892, to a lonely middle aged intellectual man in 1903 with all of his friends dead or long gone.  It is so haunting, and Mansfield's exquisite music plus Zsigmond's sepia-tinted Panavision photography, again make it a truly special motion picture if you have a whole evening viewing slot.  (There is an intermission on the letterboxed VHS copy I am reviewing.)

149527,AL277B4AQCWBG,0792843584,Steven Reynolds,"[3, 5]","What's most dismaying about this much-maligned epic disaster is how much of the 219 minute version is actually quite good. Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography is stunningly beautiful, David Mansfield's score is wonderfully evocative, and the sheer scale of some of the sequences is absolutely breathtaking. So it's a pity that the sound mix is so bad we can't hear most of the dialogue in crucial scenes, and that the script is so dire that it probably wouldn't help if we could. Key questions which most films answer (ostensibly, at least) in the first thirty minutes - Who are these people? What are their relationships? What do they want? - are left largely unaddressed. The audience is left floundering among admittedly beautiful set-pieces which make little sense, and overlong scenes which add nothing to a story we can't understand. It's a shame, because there is the essence of a great story here: starving immigrant landholders legally exterminated by ruthless cattle barons, and the idealistic minority who try to prevent their slaughter. That's dramatic; that's exciting; that's full of the necessary conflict. But in Cimino's hands - as a writer at least - it becomes directionless, obscure and, with the exception of one or two bloodthirsty shoot-outs, relentlessly dull. With a few new expository scenes, a cleaned-up sound mix, and some ruthless editing, this would have been a decent film. One day, some audacious team of filmmakers is going to tackle this story again. But only when 'Heaven's Gate' is long forgotten, and - if the public reaction in 1980 is any indication - when American audiences are ready to face up to the moral ambiguity which lies at the heart of so much of their history.",3,"It's not the editing, it's the script",1025481600,"07 1, 2002",2002,1709,"['What', 'most', 'dismaying', 'much-maligned', 'epic', 'disaster', 'how', 'much', '219', 'minute', 'version', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'Vilmos', 'Zsigmond', 'cinematography', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'David', 'Mansfield', 'score', 'wonderfully', 'evocative', 'sheer', 'scale', 'sequences', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'pity', 'sound', 'mix', 'so', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'most', 'dialogue', 'crucial', 'scenes', 'script', 'so', 'dire', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'help', 'could', 'Key', 'questions', 'most', 'films', 'answer', 'ostensibly', 'least', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'Who', 'are', 'people', 'What', 'are', 'relationships', 'What', 'do', 'want', 'are', 'left', 'largely', 'unaddressed', 'audience', 'left', 'floundering', 'admittedly', 'beautiful', 'set-pieces', 'make', 'little', 'sense', 'scenes', 'add', 'nothing', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'shame', 'essence', 'great', 'story', 'here', 'starving', 'immigrant', 'landholders', 'legally', 'exterminated', 'ruthless', 'cattle', 'barons', 'idealistic', 'minority', 'who', 'try', 'prevent', 'slaughter', 'dramatic', 'exciting', 'full', 'necessary', 'conflict', 'Cimino', 'hands', 'writer', 'least', 'directionless', 'obscure', 'exception', 'one', 'two', 'bloodthirsty', 'shoot-outs', 'relentlessly', 'dull', 'few', 'new', 'expository', 'scenes', 'cleaned-up', 'sound', 'mix', 'ruthless', 'editing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'film', 'One', 'day', 'audacious', 'team', 'filmmakers', 'going', 'tackle', 'story', 'again', 'only', 'when', 'Gate', 'long', 'forgotten', 'public', 'reaction', '1980', 'indication', 'when', 'American', 'audiences', 'are', 'ready', 'face', 'up', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'heart', 'so', 'much', 'history']",N/A

Loved the way the foreign dialogue was not subtitled. It really added to the sense of cultural confusion. And the America portrayed in the film was the real America, not the sugar coated version we get in so many movies and TV shows. We saw how money aka capital protects itself by waging war against the working class. How the working class is divided along ethnic grounds so that U.S. workers can never fight back, as Engels predicted over a century ago.After the film was done, I tried to imagine what critics of 1980 hated so much about it. All I could come up with is that the America that elected Ronald Reagan in 1980 did not want to shatter the myth of the American west. Cowboy diplomacy sounded good to them after the failure in Vietnam.I recall a history professor in college who should have known better declaring that he was a social liberal but an economic conservative. That was in 1979. Now that we have seen what ""economic conservatives"" have wrought------voodoo, trickle down economics----class warfare between the rich and everyone else, with everyone else pitted against each other in the classic ""divide and conquer"" strategy that has made a handful of businessmen god awful rich----bloody imperialism as Americans wage war in third world countries for the natural resources that we seem to believe are rightfully ours, none of this new, of course, just a recycling of the America that lead Gen. Smedley Butler to write ""War is a racket""----a country that let its best and brightest die because AIDS was God's curse against gays (and because straight versus gay is another way you can divide the working class for profit)------now that we have lived the nightmare that was Reagan-Bush-Bush-Bush (with a brief Clinton-Clinton intermission), I think that the critics' snubbing of this film was an early warning that we were heading down the same path as those cattlemen.

149531,ABMNX856X89CS,0792843584,t.g. randini,"[5, 9]","Michael Cimino is a brave guy.  In THE DEER HUNTER he leads with a forty-minute or so wedding scene.  In HEAVEN'S GATE he includes several of these rambling scenes.  I give him credit... he's the American Visconti, combining a documentary-like mise en scene with overt political ideology.  The Deer Hunter is a masterpiece.  Heaven's Gate is something less.  Mr. Cimino missed the fastball right down the middle of the plate and ended up with a long fly ball, but at least it's interesting, and the sort of movie no Hollywood studio will ever make again.  It has some gorgeous photography that and rates with DAYS OF HEAVEN.There are a few things in the film that really have me scratching my head -1)  Christopher Walken wants to marry Isabelle Huppert.  Don't you think he might mention that she's on a death list?  I mean, don't you think it might come up at least once in a conversation that she should be watching her backside?  Just ONCE?2)  Mr. Walken's house is being attacked by the fifty bounty hunters.  Ms. Huppert rides in on a rescue attempt.  Then the house is in flames.  Where does Ms. Huppert go?  SHE TOTALLY DISAPPEARS FROM THE SCENE.  POOF!  GONE!  As if the footage was lost.  THIS JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY DRAMATIC SENSE WHATSOEVER!  This is as strange as if Charlie Chaplin's reaction shot at the end of City Lights was edited out.This is one of the most mystifying things I have ever seen.3)  The Coda.  I watched this in almost complete disbelief.  I figured after the Harvard prologue, Mr. Kristofferson was a bored, jaded rich guy who had headed out West sometime after 1870 and changed his life.Now - WHAM!  He's yachting off Kennepunkport like the Kennedys and living the tycoon life.  What the blank?  Okay, and then we see HER.  The college girl.  WHAT?  You mean to tell me he was married to the college girl ALL THIS TIME and we didn't have a clue?  As if maybe this is why he never proposed to Ms. Huppert?  What was he telling his wife all these years?  ""Honey, I have to go out to Montana and marshal for a decade or so.  I might be a few minutes late for dinner.""  What the blank?Oh... okay... now on second thought I get it.  Cimino did what Sergio Leone did!  Just like half (or more) of ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA is merely Robert De Niro's opium dream, Cimino one-upped Leone.  So this is the way I see it:  Kristofferson never left the east coast after graduation.  He led the typical Harvard graduate-late 1800's monied existence.  And he was bored.  So on his yacht one day... as he stares off into the ocean... he daydreams.  And the whole Montana story is merely a daydream.  He envisions William Hurt's student nutcase become a bigger, drunker nutcase.  And he fantasizes about the French hooker love interest because he's so bored with the college girl he married.It's all just a daydream.Sublime!",4,A Dream of A Movie,1106611200,"01 25, 2005",2005,2844,"['Michael', 'Cimino', 'brave', 'guy', 'THE', 'DEER', 'HUNTER', 'forty-minute', 'so', 'wedding', 'scene', 'HEAVEN', 'GATE', 'several', 'rambling', 'scenes', 'give', 'credit', 'American', 'Visconti', 'combining', 'documentary-like', 'mise', 'en', 'scene', 'overt', 'political', 'ideology', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'masterpiece', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'something', 'less', 'Mr.', 'Cimino', 'missed', 'fastball', 'right', 'down', 'middle', 'plate', 'ended', 'up', 'long', 'fly', 'ball', 'least', 'interesting', 'sort', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'will', 'ever', 'make', 'again', 'gorgeous', 'photography', 'rates', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'HEAVEN.There', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'film', 'really', 'have', 'scratching', 'head', '-1', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'marry', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'might', 'mention', 'death', 'list', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'might', 'come', 'up', 'least', 'once', 'conversation', 'should', 'be', 'watching', 'backside', 'Just', 'ONCE', '2', 'Mr.', 'Walken', 'house', 'being', 'attacked', 'fifty', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'Ms.', 'Huppert', 'rescue', 'attempt', 'Then', 'house', 'flames', 'Where', 'Ms.', 'Huppert', 'go', 'SHE', 'TOTALLY', 'DISAPPEARS', 'FROM', 'THE', 'SCENE', 'POOF', 'GONE', 'footage', 'was', 'lost', 'THIS', 'JUST', 'DOES', ""N'T"", 'MAKE', 'ANY', 'DRAMATIC', 'SENSE', 'WHATSOEVER', 'as', 'strange', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'reaction', 'shot', 'end', 'City', 'Lights', 'was', 'edited', 'out.This', 'one', 'most', 'mystifying', 'things', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.3', 'Coda', 'watched', 'almost', 'complete', 'disbelief', 'figured', 'Harvard', 'prologue', 'Mr.', 'Kristofferson', 'was', 'bored', 'jaded', 'rich', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'headed', 'out', 'West', 'sometime', '1870', 'changed', 'life.Now', 'WHAM', 'yachting', 'off', 'Kennepunkport', 'Kennedys', 'living', 'tycoon', 'life', 'What', 'blank', 'Okay', 'then', 'see', 'college', 'girl', 'WHAT', 'mean', 'tell', 'was', 'married', 'college', 'girl', 'THIS', 'TIME', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'maybe', 'why', 'never', 'proposed', 'Ms.', 'Huppert', 'What', 'was', 'telling', 'wife', 'years', 'Honey', 'have', 'go', 'out', 'Montana', 'marshal', 'decade', 'so', 'might', 'be', 'few', 'minutes', 'late', 'dinner', 'What', 'blank', 'Oh', 'okay', 'now', 'second', 'thought', 'get', 'Cimino', 'did', 'what', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'did', 'Just', 'half', 'more', 'ONCE', 'A', 'TIME', 'IN', 'AMERICA', 'merely', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'opium', 'dream', 'Cimino', 'one-upped', 'Leone', 'way', 'see', 'Kristofferson', 'never', 'left', 'east', 'coast', 'graduation', 'led', 'typical', 'Harvard', 'graduate-late', '1800', 'monied', 'existence', 'was', 'bored', 'So', 'yacht', 'one', 'day', 'ocean', 'whole', 'Montana', 'story', 'merely', 'daydream', 'William', 'Hurt', 'student', 'nutcase', 'become', 'bigger', 'drunker', 'nutcase', 'French', 'hooker', 'love', 'interest', 'so', 'bored', 'college', 'girl', 'just', 'daydream.Sublime']",N/A

And western's make the cut, of course: from ""Forgiven"" on back to ""The magnificent Seven"", ""Winchester 73"" and ""The Searchers"".But no matter what, I usually have a soft spot for epic movies: blame it on Cecil B. Demille. ""Docotor Zhivago"", ""The Ten Commandments"", ""Red"" -- loved 'em all.And I enjoyed the hell out of ""Heaven's Gate"" when I finally had the chance to see it on VHS, back in the 80s.  Kept my copy and re-watched it; bought a DVD when it was issued.  And now that they've produced a longer, uncut version, bought that, too.The writing isn't perfect: as someone else already noted, a bit more background on _exactly_ why all the characters (met in the beginning, in that wonderful opening scene set in and outside Harvard University) go west.  And the story is _based_ on the Johnson County wars: it's not a detailed recreation of it.  The writer and Director, Cimino, borrows names and events from that seminal event to cobble up some reasonable verisimilitude -- families of immigrants, freshly moved to the western state of Wyoming, hoping for a land of plenty and encountering hardships, racism, bigotry and starvation -- as he spins a tale of class wars: rich cattle barons stomping all over poor immigrants and their families.  Everyone _isn't_ depicted as either purely evil or purely good.  There are reasons for the anger of the Cattle Barons.  And there are reasons for the desperate acts of the immigrants.  But the outcome of it all -- the Johnson County war, the murders, etc. -- and the enduring class wars in this country cannot be denied.Neither can the visual beauty of this film.  Film is a visual medium, something too many people -- especially those in the twitter and MTV generations -- often forget.  The director and the film  should show the audience things it hasn't seen before.  ""Heaven's Gate"" does just that, and more.

149537,AQP1VPK16SVWM,0792843584,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[7, 7]","Based on what occurred during Johnson County War of 1892 (although it is hardly factual), ""Heaven's Gate"" features stunning photography and strong performances. When the film was initially released it bankrupt United Artists going over budget and failing to recoup its cost and faced nasty critical barbs which seemed directed more at director Cimino (and the fact that the film went over budget) and the disappointed expectations of critics rather than the film itself.While ""Heaven's Gate"" IS flawed (in my opinion the second act could have been trimmed as the momentum achieved during the first act comes to a glacial crawl), it truly remains a visionary western influenced as much by European film directors like Visconti or David Lean (the critical reaction to ""Heaven's Gate"" in Europe remained positive and that's where the film gained stature initially over the years)as John Ford with elements of Ford's westerns thrown in for good measure.Kris Kristofferson plays a sheriff James Averill who was born into wealth but seeks justice for the immigrants that are settling in Wyoming. The immigrants are being forced from their land by wealthy cattle barons led by Frank Canton (Sam Waterston in a deliciously evil portrayal) and enforced by Averill's friend Nate Campion (Christopher Walken). Campion is also Averill's rival for the affection of madam Ella Watson (Isabelle Huppert). Watson is on Canton's hit list that he and his cronies have put together and Averill must prevent her from being murdered along with over 100 other immigrants in the region.I should warn you that even when the narrative for ""Heaven's Gate"" is moving, it has the lanquid pace. If you're expecting a quick action movie, you will be in for a disappointment but, if you are drawn into the universe that Cimino and his director of photography Vilmos Zsigmond have created with their cast and crew, you'll enjoy the movie. The 216 minute cut of the film has a narrative is much clearer than the 149 minute version that was cut for the short lived theatrical distribution of the film back in 1980.Criterion has done a superb job of restoring Cimino's original 216 minute cut of the film. Unfortunately, the original negative was cut and the trims discarded so Criterion had to work with the YCM color separations for the film. Usually transfers are done from interpositives but, as the original intact 216 minute negative no longer exists, it's not possible to strike a new interpositive from the negative for this version.In spite of this problem, Criterion has managed to assemble a terrific looking version of the film. There are some flaws evidence due to the source but these are relatively minor flaws.The 5.1 mix isn't quite as immersive as a contemporary mix but it sounds quite good.The special features are top notch as well although I do wish that Criterion had included the documentary made on the problems surrounding the film. Those problems aren't really addressed in depth anywhere in the special features on the disc but they are acknowledged and addressed (to a degree) in the extension booklet with the essay by Giulia D'Agnolo. We also get a 1980 interview with Cimino that discusses the technical challenges of making the film.The second disc features all the special features. We get a new illustrated audio interview with director Cimino and the producer of the film Joann Carelli. There are also new and in depth interviews with Kristofferson, music arranger (and performer) David Mansfield (who also appears in the film) and comments from the assistant director Michael Stevenson.Finally the special features are rounded out with a restoration demonstration, the teaser and theatrical trailer for the film.Brutally attacked when it was released back in 1980, time has restored luster to the film removing the circumstances of the difficult birth of ""Heaven's Gate"". While the production cost over runs, difficult egos and expectations of the film cost the studio that financed it, damaged the career of director Cimino and its reception when released, this Blu-ray allows a critical reassessment which is much deserved. Be aware, however, that ""Heaven's Gate"" isn't a fast paced revisionist western like ""Unforgiven"" or Leone's 1960's films.Recommended",4,"Restored version of ""Heaven's Gate"" looks exceptionally nice in 2 disc presentation from Criterion",1384905600,"11 20, 2013",2013,4260,"['Based', 'what', 'occurred', 'Johnson', 'County', 'War', '1892', 'hardly', 'factual', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'stunning', 'photography', 'strong', 'performances', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'initially', 'released', 'bankrupt', 'United', 'Artists', 'going', 'budget', 'failing', 'recoup', 'cost', 'faced', 'nasty', 'critical', 'barbs', 'seemed', 'directed', 'more', 'director', 'Cimino', 'fact', 'film', 'went', 'budget', 'disappointed', 'expectations', 'critics', 'rather', 'film', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'flawed', 'opinion', 'second', 'act', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'momentum', 'achieved', 'first', 'act', 'glacial', 'crawl', 'truly', 'visionary', 'western', 'influenced', 'much', 'European', 'film', 'directors', 'Visconti', 'David', 'Lean', 'critical', 'reaction', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'Europe', 'remained', 'positive', 'where', 'film', 'gained', 'stature', 'initially', 'years', 'John', 'Ford', 'elements', 'Ford', 'westerns', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure.Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'sheriff', 'James', 'Averill', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'wealth', 'justice', 'immigrants', 'are', 'settling', 'Wyoming', 'immigrants', 'are', 'being', 'forced', 'land', 'wealthy', 'cattle', 'barons', 'led', 'Frank', 'Canton', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'deliciously', 'evil', 'portrayal', 'enforced', 'Averill', 'friend', 'Nate', 'Campion', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Campion', 'also', 'Averill', 'rival', 'affection', 'madam', 'Ella', 'Watson', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'Watson', 'Canton', 'hit', 'list', 'cronies', 'have', 'put', 'together', 'Averill', 'must', 'prevent', 'being', 'murdered', '100', 'other', 'immigrants', 'region.I', 'should', 'warn', 'even', 'when', 'narrative', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'moving', 'lanquid', 'pace', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'quick', 'action', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'disappointment', 'are', 'drawn', 'universe', 'Cimino', 'director', 'photography', 'Vilmos', 'Zsigmond', 'have', 'created', 'cast', 'crew', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'movie', '216', 'minute', 'cut', 'film', 'narrative', 'much', 'clearer', '149', 'minute', 'version', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'lived', 'theatrical', 'distribution', 'film', 'back', '1980.Criterion', 'done', 'superb', 'job', 'restoring', 'Cimino', 'original', '216', 'minute', 'cut', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'original', 'negative', 'was', 'cut', 'trims', 'discarded', 'so', 'Criterion', 'had', 'work', 'YCM', 'color', 'separations', 'film', 'Usually', 'transfers', 'are', 'done', 'interpositives', 'original', 'intact', '216', 'minute', 'negative', 'no', 'longer', 'not', 'possible', 'strike', 'new', 'interpositive', 'negative', 'version.In', 'spite', 'problem', 'Criterion', 'managed', 'assemble', 'terrific', 'looking', 'version', 'film', 'are', 'flaws', 'evidence', 'due', 'source', 'are', 'relatively', 'minor', 'flaws.The', '5.1', 'mix', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'immersive', 'contemporary', 'mix', 'quite', 'good.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'as', 'well', 'do', 'wish', 'Criterion', 'had', 'included', 'documentary', 'made', 'problems', 'surrounding', 'film', 'problems', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'addressed', 'depth', 'anywhere', 'special', 'features', 'disc', 'are', 'acknowledged', 'addressed', 'degree', 'extension', 'booklet', 'essay', 'Giulia', ""D'Agnolo"", 'also', 'get', '1980', 'interview', 'Cimino', 'technical', 'challenges', 'making', 'film.The', 'second', 'disc', 'special', 'features', 'get', 'new', 'illustrated', 'audio', 'interview', 'director', 'Cimino', 'producer', 'film', 'Joann', 'Carelli', 'are', 'also', 'new', 'depth', 'interviews', 'Kristofferson', 'music', 'arranger', 'performer', 'David', 'Mansfield', 'who', 'also', 'film', 'comments', 'assistant', 'director', 'Michael', 'Stevenson.Finally', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'rounded', 'out', 'restoration', 'demonstration', 'teaser', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'film.Brutally', 'attacked', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'back', '1980', 'time', 'restored', 'luster', 'film', 'removing', 'circumstances', 'difficult', 'birth', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'production', 'cost', 'runs', 'difficult', 'egos', 'expectations', 'film', 'cost', 'studio', 'financed', 'damaged', 'career', 'director', 'Cimino', 'reception', 'when', 'released', 'Blu-ray', 'critical', 'reassessment', 'much', 'deserved', 'Be', 'aware', 'however', 'Heaven', 'Gate', ""n't"", 'fast', 'paced', 'revisionist', 'western', 'Unforgiven', 'Leone', '1960', 'films.Recommended']",N/A

The photography is great and the sets and costumes are great.The picture looks great. But * * *The story of this movie is very poorly told, barely told, really. Here is the story. Some rich guy graduates from Harvard in 1870. He goes west to bring civilization or some such thing to Wyoming. He becomes a law officer in Johnson County, Wy. A bunch of immigrants have moved into the county and become farmers. This upsets the rich cattle interests, because the farmers are taking ""their"" land. So the rich guys decides to run the immigrant farmers out of the area, or to just plain kill them. The farmers are a sympathetic group and they are not doing well financially. Many are starving. The cattle men are scum and they are rich. So we have the ingredients for a good movie. But what we get is just awful.Here is why this movie is awful. It takes forever for the movie to make a point, to tell just part of the story, to communicate what is going on. It reminded me of the late comedian Andy Kaufman reading The Great Gatsby to his audiences during his stand up act. The audience hated it because, after a very short time, there was no point to it. That is what Heaven's Gate is all about -- not making a point or taking forever to make a point. This horrible movie just goes on and on and on and on.I could not even figure out why the movie is called Heaven's Gate.

149539,A2P7W7VDRM5BOD,0792843584,"Yanni Sis ""Zoom, zoom""","[10, 13]","I have now seen the film four times including twice on it's original run over 25 years ago and all I can say is that see it and judge for yourself - you will be pleasantly surprised.  Apart from the first 20 minute sequence which tries to create a mood of halcyon days but fails somewhat, the rest of this beautiful film (and it is stunning visually) ranks alongside many other westerns favoured and promoted by the same critics who maligned this one.  In fact, it presents a far truer picture of 'how the west was won' and shows how the social, economic and political factors mainly determined by greedy easterners were manipulated to their own ends although this is my own opinion as this elegiac western is actually ambiguous in pointing blame and much of the morality is anything but  black and white.  It does, however, clearly show how the stockholders were more than willing take advantage of their status, class and wealth to bend the law and even redefine it to achieve their objectives.  So not much has changed in the last 100 odd years then since the events of the film.Kristofferson, Walken and Huppert get the most screen time, individually and in pairs, but the rest of the cast is top notch too and both Waterston and Bridges shine in their smaller roles.As I stated above the film is visually stunning thanks to Vilmos Zsigmond,  but the emphasis is firmly on the story and characterisation.  Although ""Heaven's Gate"" is nearly four hours long, it never feels like it and once you are immersed in the story and visuals the picture never wants for pace.  The music is not overblown but actually plays a part in setting the mood more so than being suggestive of what emotions we should be feeling and being relentless as in most modern epics.  Musical highlights include  when Ella first drives the Studebaker carriage, the picnic and later during the roller derby line dance sequence.There is much to enjoy in this fine film and I can honestly say that what the establishment critics said at the time of the film's initial release is unfounded and unfair and reeks of a witch hunt.If you have a multi-region dvd player, I suggest you seek out the Region 4 version (Australia) as it is anamorphic.",5,"Far, far better than the idiot critics stated...the film was a victim of vicious and biased muckraking...",1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,2212,"['have', 'now', 'seen', 'film', 'four', 'times', 'including', 'twice', 'original', 'run', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'can', 'say', 'see', 'judge', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Apart', 'first', '20', 'minute', 'sequence', 'create', 'mood', 'halcyon', 'days', 'somewhat', 'rest', 'beautiful', 'film', 'stunning', 'visually', 'ranks', 'alongside', 'many', 'other', 'westerns', 'favoured', 'promoted', 'same', 'critics', 'who', 'maligned', 'one', 'fact', 'far', 'truer', 'picture', 'west', 'was', 'won', 'how', 'social', 'economic', 'political', 'factors', 'mainly', 'determined', 'greedy', 'easterners', 'were', 'manipulated', 'own', 'ends', 'own', 'opinion', 'elegiac', 'western', 'actually', 'ambiguous', 'pointing', 'blame', 'much', 'morality', 'anything', 'black', 'white', 'however', 'clearly', 'show', 'how', 'stockholders', 'were', 'more', 'willing', 'take', 'advantage', 'status', 'class', 'wealth', 'bend', 'law', 'even', 'redefine', 'achieve', 'objectives', 'So', 'not', 'much', 'changed', 'last', '100', 'odd', 'years', 'then', 'events', 'film.Kristofferson', 'Walken', 'Huppert', 'get', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'individually', 'pairs', 'rest', 'cast', 'top', 'notch', 'too', 'Waterston', 'Bridges', 'shine', 'smaller', 'roles.As', 'stated', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'thanks', 'Vilmos', 'Zsigmond', 'emphasis', 'firmly', 'story', 'characterisation', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'nearly', 'four', 'hours', 'long', 'never', 'once', 'are', 'immersed', 'story', 'visuals', 'picture', 'never', 'pace', 'music', 'not', 'overblown', 'actually', 'part', 'setting', 'mood', 'more', 'so', 'being', 'suggestive', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'feeling', 'being', 'relentless', 'most', 'modern', 'epics', 'Musical', 'highlights', 'include', 'when', 'Ella', 'first', 'Studebaker', 'carriage', 'picnic', 'later', 'roller', 'derby', 'line', 'dance', 'sequence.There', 'much', 'enjoy', 'fine', 'film', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'what', 'establishment', 'critics', 'said', 'time', 'film', 'initial', 'release', 'unfounded', 'unfair', 'reeks', 'witch', 'hunt.If', 'have', 'multi-region', 'dvd', 'player', 'suggest', 'seek', 'out', 'Region', '4', 'version', 'Australia', 'anamorphic']",N/A
