I can't even begin to explain how rediculously and absurdly bad-bad-bad this movie is.  Wow. Bad.

I have not given a 1 star for a film in a long time.  The film does not have any continuity and makes absolutely no sense at all.  It now makes all the more sense when the others who have watched the uncut versions, to see how butchered this film is because it makes absolutely no sense at all.  THe only good thing I could say about this is it does have some humor in it that will totally make u laugh but its not enough to make up for the ... of film this is.

Perhaps, the plot could have been slightly more developed, rather than handing us snipets of the stories motive. The reason that I say this is that if it were simply a slasher style film with little plot that would have been sufficient, but the storyline for this film required that the viewer have more knowledge of what the events leading up to and occuring in the film concerned. High points of the film included the following: decent acting, and subtle dark humor, as well as a few moderately entertaing action sequences. Of course, the highest point of the film...actress Kimberly Liebe. Her acting was comparable with the acting of the other cast members, but her beauty was the most memorable!

The writer has several characters, some connected, some not, all thrown together with no plot and little meaning. The dialogue between the characters is interesting in places, but that can't save this movie.It seems like it was meant to be a re-telling of From Dusk to Dawn, but then characters are included that are building a Legion of the Dead, yet this doesn't seem to tie into the rest of the film other than to provide a catchy title for the movie.I have no clue what the creative vision was that was spinning in the writer/director's head, just that whoever put this together needs to have an editor take a much firmer hand next time. The ending is even terrible.Look, if you want funny horror, watch Evil Dead- again. If you want Tarantino does vampires and demons, watch From Dusk Till Dawn (ok, he's just an actor in it, but humor me here). Just do yourself a favor and don't waste an hour and half of your time like I did.Not Recommended at all.",2,Wha......

While stylish and often times very funny, LEGION OF THE DEAD doesn't know whether it wants to be a tribute to EVIL DEAD or just an excuse for some bloody goings on.  Two friends drifting through the California desert are picked up by a deranged hitchhiker.  Meanwhile two grey-suited hitmen are going around killing people to enlist them in a legion of the dead.  The hitmen are funny, especially the inept drunken one who is always getting himself killed over and over again.  They answer to a tall blonde who purportedly may be the Devil.  We also have a buxom barmaid named Geena who is the one person the Devil is seeking.  how does this all come together?  It really doesn't and that's what keeps this movie from being a good one...it does have some funny moments, but the acting is histrionic and since we don't know what in the world is going on, its ending only manages to confirm the lack of coherency.",3,U TELL ME,1097193600,"10 8, 2004",2004,944,"['movie', 'stylish', 'often', 'times', 'very', 'funny', 'LEGION', 'THE', 'DEAD', ""n't"", 'know', 'be', 'tribute', 'EVIL', 'DEAD', 'just', 'excuse', 'bloody', 'goings', 'Two', 'friends', 'drifting', 'California', 'desert', 'are', 'picked', 'up', 'deranged', 'hitchhiker', 'Meanwhile', 'two', 'grey-suited', 'hitmen', 'are', 'going', 'killing', 'people', 'enlist', 'legion', 'dead', 'hitmen', 'are', 'funny', 'especially', 'inept', 'drunken', 'one', 'who', 'always', 'getting', 'killed', 'over', 'again', 'answer', 'tall', 'blonde', 'who', 'purportedly', 'may', 'be', 'Devil', 'also', 'have', 'buxom', 'barmaid', 'named', 'Geena', 'who', 'one', 'person', 'Devil', 'seeking', 'how', 'come', 'together', 'really', ""n't"", 'what', 'movie', 'being', 'good', 'one', 'have', 'funny', 'moments', 'acting', 'histrionic', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'world', 'going', 'ending', 'only', 'confirm', 'lack', 'coherency']",Legion of the Dead
