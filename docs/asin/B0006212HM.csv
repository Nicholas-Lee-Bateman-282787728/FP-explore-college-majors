855838,A34M7WLS58NNJR,B0006212HM,M. G P SCOTT,"[6, 6]",'Ellen' has been my favourite sitcom since season one. Took me a while to get over the loss of Holly & Anita from season one and I recall actually hating the Paige character for a while which now just seems shocking! I have seen these episodes many many times but they still make me laugh out loud. Ms Degeneres' comic timing is astonishingly perfect but its the supporting characters that pull this show together as everybody gets funny lines and the fun these guys must of had making the show oozes off the screen. I love it. I dont think it will ever be topped.,5,Perfect TV,1108598400,"02 17, 2005",2005,564,"[""'Ellen"", 'been', 'favourite', 'sitcom', 'season', 'one', 'Took', 'while', 'get', 'loss', 'Holly', 'Anita', 'season', 'one', 'recall', 'actually', 'hating', 'Paige', 'character', 'while', 'now', 'just', 'shocking', 'have', 'seen', 'episodes', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'still', 'make', 'out', 'loud', 'Ms', 'Degeneres', 'comic', 'timing', 'astonishingly', 'perfect', 'supporting', 'characters', 'pull', 'show', 'together', 'everybody', 'funny', 'lines', 'fun', 'guys', 'must', 'had', 'making', 'show', 'screen', 'love', 'dont', 'think', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'topped']",N/A

While it started out slowly (and under a different name, ""These Friends of Mine""), in the second season it really picked up steam.  There are some classic episodes here, including many scenes of expertly performed physical comedy that hadn't been seen on TV since Lucy's heyday.I didn't notice any serious picture flaws (like the other reviewer), but I did notice the change in volume from one episode to the next.  One would think that that would be relatively easy to fix when mastering the episodes for dvd.  Hopefully the following seasons will be handled a bit bitter.I'm also disappointed by the relative lack of extras.  It seems as if Ellen wants to have nothing to do with these dvd releases as she has so far not done commentary tracks for either the first or second season.  Hopefully in some future packages she will provide some commentary tracks or interviews regarding her experience working on the show.",4,bring on the rest of the series!,1109289600,"02 25, 2005",2005,1030,"['are', 'Ellen', 'DeGeneres', 'fan', 'then', ""'re"", 'happy', 'show', 'finally', 'making', 'way', 'dvd', 'started', 'out', 'slowly', 'different', 'name', 'Friends', 'Mine', 'second', 'season', 'really', 'picked', 'up', 'steam', 'are', 'classic', 'episodes', 'here', 'including', 'many', 'scenes', 'expertly', 'performed', 'physical', 'comedy', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'TV', 'Lucy', 'heyday.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'serious', 'picture', 'flaws', 'other', 'reviewer', 'did', 'notice', 'change', 'volume', 'one', 'episode', 'next', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'relatively', 'easy', 'fix', 'when', 'mastering', 'episodes', 'dvd', 'Hopefully', 'following', 'seasons', 'will', 'be', 'handled', 'bit', 'bitter.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'disappointed', 'relative', 'lack', 'extras', 'Ellen', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'dvd', 'so', 'far', 'not', 'done', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'first', 'second', 'season', 'Hopefully', 'future', 'will', 'provide', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'interviews', 'regarding', 'experience', 'working', 'show']",N/A
