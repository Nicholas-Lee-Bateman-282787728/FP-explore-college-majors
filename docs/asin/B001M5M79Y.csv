It's not your typical romantic comedy a.k.a ""chick flick"" that you'll see at the theater, it was deeper than that. It was more real, with real people and real relationships; and at the end it wasn't the typical happy ending, which is good because that crap can get boring real fast. It is definitely something that i am going to buy on DVD and have my boyfriend watch with me.Not a Hollywood blockbuster, but well worth watching and enjoying.",4,Not your typical romantic comedy,1259020800,"11 24, 2009",2009,663,"['discovered', 'movie', 'hulu', 'places', 'i', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'movie', 'pass', 'time', 'i', 'was', 'bored', 'when', 'i', 'got', 'finished', 'watching', 'i', 'was', 'glad', 'i', 'did', 'i', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'chick', 'flick', ""'ll"", 'see', 'theater', 'was', 'deeper', 'was', 'more', 'real', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'relationships', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'typical', 'happy', 'ending', 'good', 'crap', 'can', 'get', 'boring', 'real', 'fast', 'definitely', 'something', 'i', 'am', 'going', 'buy', 'DVD', 'have', 'boyfriend', 'watch', 'me.Not', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'enjoying']",Strictly Sexual

If it makes for plausible good drama and the film can take off then it is a fair trade. The two couples are at each end of the spectrum. One are sassy , sexy and aggressive, the other sensitive and caring more than sexual. If you just enjoy the screen-play , acting and the lively dynamics,  it is a funny , warm and intriguing film.What it is not is a bunch of cliches and histrionics.

1216114,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B001M5M79Y,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[7, 7]","This story was written by and starred Indie film writer Stevie Long.  If you like the concept of two girl friends meeting two guy friends, and experimenting with meaningless sex and casual nonchalant behavior because of it, then you will enjoy this film.These girls have no interest in having a real relationship with any guy, but they still want sex and they want to have it as a needed pass time, not as a loving relationship, but that's not how it turns out.  Emotions get in the way and that causes them to actually discuss their feelings, which ruins everything for one couple, but blossoms into something special for the other couple.One girl (Amber Benson) loves wild and carnivorous sex, while the other girl (Kristen Kerr) is more shy and inhibited. Of the guys, one guy (Stevie Long, this story's writer) feels compelled to insult women and yet that seems to make his girl more wild and horny.  While the other guy (Johann Urb), the nice guy (the mistake most of us guys make being) is more patient with his more hesitant shyer girl and yet their relationship grows into something more strong and meaningful. I don't think anybody here wanted to fall in love, but how cold, shallow, and disconcerting can you be if you continually keep the same person as your only sexual encounter?I liked how the shy girl starts to realize her own need for sexual spontaneity, as the best scene (to me) is when they were in the car and she decided to just go down on him because her sexual yearnings were becoming more prevalent. She just had a great day at work, and so she wanted to reward herself with something sexual in the car, right away.  That was very cute.This was a great film.  Even the deleted scenes (as an extra in the special features) offers some valuable dialogue about what everyone's feelings were about with their unique fabricated sexual situation with each other.  I would buy this film if I found it cheaper (or used) because I think it's a great movie to follow the film ""Sideways"" (which actually impressed me less).It's definitely worth renting once.  Check it out.",4,"If you liked the movie ""Sideways"", this is actually better",1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,2087,"['story', 'was', 'written', 'starred', 'Indie', 'film', 'writer', 'Stevie', 'Long', 'like', 'concept', 'two', 'girl', 'friends', 'meeting', 'two', 'guy', 'friends', 'experimenting', 'meaningless', 'sex', 'casual', 'nonchalant', 'behavior', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film.These', 'girls', 'have', 'interest', 'having', 'real', 'relationship', 'guy', 'still', 'want', 'sex', 'want', 'have', 'needed', 'pass', 'time', 'not', 'loving', 'relationship', 'not', 'how', 'out', 'Emotions', 'get', 'way', 'actually', 'discuss', 'feelings', 'everything', 'one', 'couple', 'blossoms', 'something', 'special', 'other', 'couple.One', 'girl', 'Amber', 'Benson', 'wild', 'carnivorous', 'sex', 'other', 'girl', 'Kristen', 'Kerr', 'more', 'shy', 'inhibited', 'guys', 'one', 'guy', 'Stevie', 'Long', 'story', 'writer', 'compelled', 'insult', 'women', 'yet', 'make', 'girl', 'more', 'wild', 'horny', 'other', 'guy', 'Johann', 'Urb', 'nice', 'guy', 'mistake', 'most', 'guys', 'make', 'being', 'more', 'patient', 'more', 'hesitant', 'shyer', 'girl', 'yet', 'relationship', 'something', 'more', 'strong', 'meaningful', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anybody', 'here', 'wanted', 'fall', 'love', 'how', 'cold', 'shallow', 'disconcerting', 'can', 'be', 'continually', 'keep', 'same', 'person', 'only', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'liked', 'how', 'shy', 'girl', 'realize', 'own', 'need', 'sexual', 'spontaneity', 'best', 'scene', 'when', 'were', 'car', 'decided', 'just', 'go', 'down', 'sexual', 'yearnings', 'were', 'becoming', 'more', 'prevalent', 'just', 'had', 'great', 'day', 'work', 'so', 'wanted', 'reward', 'something', 'sexual', 'car', 'right', 'away', 'was', 'very', 'cute.This', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'Even', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'extra', 'special', 'features', 'valuable', 'dialogue', 'what', 'everyone', 'feelings', 'were', 'unique', 'fabricated', 'sexual', 'situation', 'other', 'would', 'buy', 'film', 'found', 'cheaper', 'used', 'think', 'great', 'movie', 'follow', 'film', 'Sideways', 'actually', 'impressed', 'less', '.It', 'definitely', 'worth', 'renting', 'once', 'Check', 'out']",Strictly Sexual
