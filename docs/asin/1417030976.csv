172880,A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST,1417030976,Best Of All,"[0, 0]","Did you know the script for Dreamer - Inspired by a True Story was bouncing around Hollywood before Seabiscuit was ever penned as a screenplay?Did you know that the wisdom of Hollywood after the huge success of Seabiscuit was to cast Dreamer aside?And just like a claimer who springboards from the mid-level tracks to placing in graded stakes, Dreamer became a winner even with the odds against it reaching the starting line.The star of the movie is Dakota Fanning, who portrays the daughter of a struggling family of a horse trainer who has a twin burden; living up to the standard in the industry set by his father-in-law and trying to compete in a sport that has little room left for a small operation. Fanning reaches out to the injured racer - Sonador (Dreamer in English) - and the pair then have the heart to touch others in such positive ways, including the audience.Fanning is the glue that keeps the family together as she helps her father, Ben Crane, portrayed by Kurt Russell, rehabilitate the racer, who suffered a near fatal injury on the track, and brings the shattered family circle together by reaching out to her grandfather, artfully played by Kris Kristofferson.The opening scene of the filly racer breaking down in the stretch drive is powerful. I saw the film at a sneak preview and the reaction by the audience was if we were witnessing the injury live at the track.Instead of having the runner he was training for a top owner euthanized on the track, Crane purchases the Thoroughbred. The viewer is then led on a journey that culminates with the longshot beating the boys in the Breeders' Cup Classic.There are liberties taken in the story that would certainly infuriate the track curmudgeon. But the Thoroughbred industry stepped up to allow the audience a unique perspective on several aspects of the sport only the most insider views on a daily basis.The story is uplifting and a great family film. And you will cheer each time you watch Sonador win the big race; because of the victory for an underdog in so many ways.",4,What Might Have Been,1158537600,"09 18, 2006",2006,2046,"['Did', 'know', 'script', 'Dreamer', 'Inspired', 'True', 'Story', 'was', 'bouncing', 'around', 'Hollywood', 'Seabiscuit', 'was', 'ever', 'penned', 'screenplay', 'Did', 'know', 'wisdom', 'Hollywood', 'huge', 'success', 'Seabiscuit', 'was', 'cast', 'Dreamer', 'aside', 'just', 'claimer', 'who', 'mid-level', 'tracks', 'placing', 'graded', 'stakes', 'Dreamer', 'became', 'winner', 'even', 'odds', 'reaching', 'starting', 'line.The', 'star', 'movie', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'who', 'daughter', 'struggling', 'family', 'horse', 'trainer', 'who', 'twin', 'burden', 'living', 'up', 'standard', 'industry', 'set', 'father-in-law', 'trying', 'compete', 'sport', 'little', 'room', 'left', 'small', 'operation', 'Fanning', 'injured', 'racer', 'Sonador', 'Dreamer', 'English', 'pair', 'then', 'have', 'heart', 'touch', 'others', 'such', 'positive', 'ways', 'including', 'audience.Fanning', 'glue', 'family', 'together', 'father', 'Ben', 'Crane', 'portrayed', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'rehabilitate', 'racer', 'who', 'suffered', 'near', 'fatal', 'injury', 'track', 'shattered', 'family', 'circle', 'together', 'reaching', 'out', 'grandfather', 'artfully', 'played', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'filly', 'racer', 'breaking', 'down', 'stretch', 'drive', 'powerful', 'saw', 'film', 'sneak', 'preview', 'reaction', 'audience', 'was', 'were', 'witnessing', 'injury', 'live', 'track.Instead', 'having', 'runner', 'was', 'training', 'top', 'owner', 'euthanized', 'track', 'Crane', 'purchases', 'Thoroughbred', 'viewer', 'then', 'led', 'journey', 'longshot', 'beating', 'boys', 'Breeders', 'Cup', 'Classic.There', 'are', 'liberties', 'taken', 'story', 'would', 'certainly', 'infuriate', 'track', 'curmudgeon', 'Thoroughbred', 'industry', 'stepped', 'up', 'allow', 'audience', 'unique', 'perspective', 'several', 'aspects', 'sport', 'only', 'most', 'insider', 'views', 'daily', 'basis.The', 'story', 'uplifting', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'will', 'cheer', 'time', 'watch', 'Sonador', 'win', 'big', 'race', 'victory', 'underdog', 'so', 'many', 'ways']",N/A

I loved that Dakota Fanning played the girl who ended up owning a broken down horse her father, Kurt Russell, got for her when, instead of shooting the horse after an injury, he took it for his pay.

There were so many suspenseful, idyllic, sad, joyous and wonderfully funny and heartwarming moments in this story. This is the movie where I ""found"" Freddie Rodriguez.

172882,A3JPFWKS83R49V,1417030976,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[2, 2]","Dreamer"" is an inspiring movie based about a horse named Sonador who comes back against all odds after nearly being put down by her former owner. This movie is loosely based on a similar story, one involving a horse named Mariah's Storm- a young filly that broke her cannon bone and seemed to be finished with her racing career, only to recover and win several big races.Dreamer is a winning film in several ways. Most important among them are the performances by Kurt Russell and Dakota Fanning. Kurt Russell is a veteran of the big screen and he has appeared in a diverse range of movies. Most movie fans associate Kurt Russell with his tough guy roles, but he proves here that he can easily handle a dramatic role and his performance is excellent. Equally enthralling is the superb performance by eleven year old Dakota Fanning. She is near perfect in her role as the young daughter of Kurt Russell's horse training character. She is intelligent, sensitive, and immensely likeable. You want to see her win, not just at the race track but in life. Kris Kristofferson is also very good in his role as Kurt Russell's father.The other qualities that make Dreamer such a good film are its story of sacrifice and its message of inspiration. Here you have a dad who has already been fired from his job over this young female horse. He then loses possession of the horse but is so inspired by his daughter's story (one that she wrote for a school project and that he reads aloud in front of the class) that he and his father find a way to scrape together the funds to get the horse back. Then, when Sonador is nursed back to health, he gets an offer from his former boss to sell her back to him for a hefty sum of money, not to mention an offer to give him back his job. But Kurt Russell's character has not only his pride at stake, he also has the example and the dreams of his young daughter to consider. He could have easily accepted the offer and rescued himself and his family from a financial crisis. But he turns it down, all for the sake of his beloved little girl.Looking for some missing ingredients in this movie, I can only think of a few. One is the lack of any extensive sports racing footage. When I first heard about this film, I knew it was about horses and I knew it would it would feature some racing scenes. Unfortunately, there are limited races so it will be a disappointment to those who view this movie hoping for some heart- stopping thrills as the racehorses circle the tracks. Another small flaw is the lack of any deep story line. The story is moving and emotional, but it doesn't get very complicated. It is kept at a simplistic level, probably to make it more family friendly.Another thing that bothered me a little with this movie is the lack of screen time for Kurt Russell's wife, played in the movie by Elizabeth Shue. It is easy to see that she and Kurt Russell are close and that they both want the best for their little girl. But Shue has no significant role in the film and her part could have been written out completely without changing the movie in any significant way. Director John Gatins should have found a better way to utilize Elizabeth Shue's many talents and given her a greater role in the film.This movie is generally predictable and you will likely guess the outcome accurately within the first twenty minutes. It also features the typical host of ""bad"" (Kurt Russell's boss John Palmer) and ""good"" (Dakota Fanning and Kurt Russell) characters often associated with family films like this. It features a bright, likeable little girl and a hard- working father who wants to do what is right and turns rejects the easy way out in favor of principle.""Dreamer"" is, overall, a very good movie in spite of its few minor flaws. It's full of clich?'s and it's mostly predictable. But it's still a good movie- entertaining for the entire family and the type of movie that horse lovers will want to watch over and over again. The inspiration of self- sacrifice and the heart warming story make this a movie worth seeing.",4,Inspiring Family Drama,1146009600,"04 26, 2006",2006,4057,"['Dreamer', 'inspiring', 'movie', 'based', 'horse', 'named', 'Sonador', 'who', 'back', 'odds', 'nearly', 'being', 'put', 'down', 'former', 'owner', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'similar', 'story', 'one', 'involving', 'horse', 'named', 'Mariah', 'Storm-', 'young', 'filly', 'broke', 'cannon', 'bone', 'seemed', 'be', 'finished', 'racing', 'career', 'only', 'recover', 'win', 'several', 'big', 'races.Dreamer', 'winning', 'film', 'several', 'ways', 'Most', 'important', 'are', 'performances', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'veteran', 'big', 'screen', 'appeared', 'diverse', 'range', 'movies', 'Most', 'movie', 'fans', 'associate', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'tough', 'guy', 'roles', 'here', 'can', 'easily', 'handle', 'dramatic', 'role', 'performance', 'excellent', 'Equally', 'enthralling', 'superb', 'performance', 'eleven', 'year', 'old', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'near', 'perfect', 'role', 'young', 'daughter', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'horse', 'training', 'character', 'intelligent', 'sensitive', 'immensely', 'likeable', 'want', 'see', 'win', 'not', 'just', 'race', 'track', 'life', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'father.The', 'other', 'qualities', 'make', 'Dreamer', 'good', 'film', 'are', 'story', 'sacrifice', 'message', 'inspiration', 'Here', 'have', 'dad', 'who', 'already', 'been', 'fired', 'job', 'young', 'female', 'horse', 'then', 'possession', 'horse', 'so', 'inspired', 'daughter', 'story', 'one', 'wrote', 'school', 'project', 'aloud', 'front', 'class', 'father', 'find', 'way', 'scrape', 'together', 'funds', 'get', 'horse', 'back', 'Then', 'when', 'Sonador', 'nursed', 'back', 'health', 'offer', 'former', 'boss', 'sell', 'back', 'hefty', 'sum', 'money', 'not', 'mention', 'offer', 'give', 'back', 'job', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'character', 'not', 'only', 'pride', 'stake', 'also', 'example', 'dreams', 'young', 'daughter', 'consider', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'accepted', 'offer', 'rescued', 'family', 'financial', 'crisis', 'down', 'sake', 'beloved', 'little', 'girl.Looking', 'missing', 'ingredients', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'think', 'few', 'One', 'lack', 'extensive', 'sports', 'racing', 'footage', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'film', 'knew', 'was', 'horses', 'knew', 'would', 'would', 'feature', 'racing', 'scenes', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'limited', 'races', 'will', 'be', 'disappointment', 'who', 'view', 'movie', 'hoping', 'heart-', 'stopping', 'thrills', 'racehorses', 'circle', 'tracks', 'small', 'flaw', 'lack', 'deep', 'story', 'line', 'story', 'moving', 'emotional', ""n't"", 'get', 'very', 'complicated', 'kept', 'simplistic', 'level', 'probably', 'make', 'more', 'family', 'friendly.Another', 'thing', 'bothered', 'little', 'movie', 'lack', 'screen', 'time', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'wife', 'played', 'movie', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'easy', 'see', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'are', 'close', 'want', 'best', 'little', 'girl', 'Shue', 'significant', 'role', 'film', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'out', 'completely', 'changing', 'movie', 'significant', 'way', 'Director', 'John', 'Gatins', 'should', 'have', 'found', 'better', 'way', 'utilize', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'many', 'talents', 'given', 'greater', 'role', 'film.This', 'movie', 'generally', 'predictable', 'will', 'likely', 'guess', 'outcome', 'accurately', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'also', 'typical', 'host', 'bad', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'boss', 'John', 'Palmer', 'good', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'characters', 'often', 'associated', 'family', 'films', 'bright', 'likeable', 'little', 'girl', 'hard-', 'working', 'father', 'who', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'easy', 'way', 'favor', 'principle', 'Dreamer', 'overall', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'spite', 'few', 'minor', 'flaws', 'full', 'clich', 'mostly', 'predictable', 'still', 'good', 'movie-', 'entertaining', 'entire', 'family', 'type', 'movie', 'horse', 'lovers', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'inspiration', 'self-', 'sacrifice', 'heart', 'warming', 'story', 'make', 'movie', 'seeing']",N/A

When the owner's prized philly takes a hard spill during a training run, Ben is advised to put the horse down. Instead, he decides to adopt the horse, and takes her to his farm for rehabilitation. Although Ben comes from a long line of Kentucky horsemen, his farm is rather run-down, and his finances are in dire straits. His wife has to work odd shifts in the town diner, and his relationship with his father and daughter is strained. Soon after adopting the horse and making several unsuccessful attempts to mate her (which can bring in some serious money because of her lineage), he begins training her to race again. To make a long story short, the process of bringing the horse back to the racetrack is what this movie is all about.  ALL of the characters interact well together in this movie.

172889,A2BD0G4SRK0WMV,1417030976,CodeMaster Talon,"[84, 92]","Dakota Fanning's new horse film, ""Dreamer"", was not a movie I was planning to see. The trailer was kind of boring and while I enjoy a good horse yarn there's a lot out there right now. But I got free tickets, so I went. And while ""Dreamer"" doesn't approach such gold standards as ""National Velvet"" or ""The Black Stallion"", the film is a well-made and ultimately thrilling story of a horse and its girl.Fanning stars as Cale Crane, the latest in a long line of horse people in the Crane family. The Cranes have fallen on hard times: their horse farm is being sold off piece by piece, Mom has to pick up shifts in a diner, and when one night a horse Mr. Crane is training takes a bad fall Dad loses his job and inherits the busted-up horse to boot.Universally advised to put the horse down, Crane (Kurt Russel) instead plans to fix her up just enough so he can breed her. How that rather reasonable plan evolves into a plan to race the horse, whose name ""Sonador"" means ""dreamer"" in Spanish, is the fun of the movie and what makes it a notch above the typical ""inspirational"" story.The first half of the film drags a bit (shots of clouds going by and grass standing still don't help), but it gets better, and Fanning as usual is great. I thought the young kids in the audience I was with would be bored by the relatively slow tone, but they absolutely loved the movie, and for the entire last five minutes of the film they were cheering and yelling and you couldn't hear what was going on in the film. Based on that reaction I give this film four stars and recommended it to families, especially those with any horse-loving girls. Just explain to your kids that jumping off the house roof onto hay bales is a bad idea, no matter what Fanning does.GRADE: B",4,"""When you ran the earth shook and the sky opened and mere motrals parted...""",1129852800,"10 21, 2005",2005,1753,"['Dakota', 'Fanning', 'new', 'horse', 'film', 'Dreamer', 'was', 'not', 'movie', 'was', 'planning', 'see', 'trailer', 'was', 'kind', 'boring', 'enjoy', 'good', 'horse', 'yarn', 'lot', 'there', 'right', 'now', 'got', 'free', 'tickets', 'went', 'Dreamer', ""n't"", 'approach', 'such', 'gold', 'standards', 'National', 'Velvet', 'Black', 'Stallion', 'film', 'well-made', 'ultimately', 'thrilling', 'story', 'horse', 'girl.Fanning', 'stars', 'Cale', 'Crane', 'latest', 'long', 'line', 'horse', 'people', 'Crane', 'family', 'Cranes', 'have', 'fallen', 'hard', 'times', 'horse', 'farm', 'being', 'sold', 'off', 'piece', 'piece', 'Mom', 'pick', 'up', 'shifts', 'diner', 'when', 'one', 'night', 'horse', 'Mr.', 'Crane', 'training', 'bad', 'fall', 'Dad', 'job', 'busted-up', 'horse', 'boot.Universally', 'advised', 'put', 'horse', 'down', 'Crane', 'Kurt', 'Russel', 'instead', 'fix', 'up', 'just', 'enough', 'can', 'breed', 'How', 'rather', 'reasonable', 'plan', 'plan', 'race', 'horse', 'name', 'Sonador', 'dreamer', 'Spanish', 'fun', 'movie', 'what', 'notch', 'typical', 'inspirational', 'story.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'bit', 'shots', 'clouds', 'going', 'grass', 'standing', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'better', 'Fanning', 'usual', 'great', 'thought', 'young', 'kids', 'audience', 'was', 'would', 'be', 'bored', 'relatively', 'slow', 'tone', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'movie', 'entire', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'were', 'cheering', 'yelling', 'could', ""n't"", 'hear', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'film', 'Based', 'reaction', 'give', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'recommended', 'families', 'especially', 'horse-loving', 'girls', 'Just', 'explain', 'kids', 'jumping', 'off', 'house', 'roof', 'hay', 'bales', 'bad', 'idea', 'matter', 'what', 'Fanning', 'does.GRADE', 'B']",N/A

It didn't disappoint me, except  I didn't play close enough attention to the word ""inspired"" in the title because, unlike the story of Seabiscuit, this isn't what really happened.It's based on a nice comeback story a real racehorse, ""Mariah's Storm,"" which did make a great comeback from a serious injury but not to the extent of what happens here in this movie. This was exaggerated to the hilt for dramatic purposes, but that's okay once you know that because the story is, indeed, ""inspirational.""Most important, this is about as nice a modern-day film as you will ever find. There's nary a swear word, hardly even a raised voice. There are nice characters and a sweet, family-friendly tone to it with a tear-in-your-eyes Seabiscuit-type tale and ending.Dakota Fanning once again demonstrates why she is the greatest child actor of her generation. Kurt Russell is excellent, too. Ole Kurt must be mellowing these days playing subdued nice guys like this. It's good to see. The same goes for Elisabeth Shue. This is a far cry from her role in Leaving Las Vegas. Even Kris Kristofferson holds his tongue in this film! Amazing.Like Seabiscuit, this also is beautifully filmed. I wonder if any sport is filmed and is just surrounded by all this beauty in real-life, too, like horse racing? It IS ""the sport of kings."" There is some spectacular scenery in here, much of it in Kentucky and where better to be when filming a horse racing story?So, if you and your kids - or just you - want to settle in for nice film, and you're looking for a pleasing, nice-looking, feel-good story you absolutely cannot miss with this film.

With so many movies relying on bullets flying, body parts separating, and F-bombs dropping by the plane load, it is always refreshing when a movie like ""Dreamer"" comes around.  Combine that with three really great actors - Kurt Russell, Dakota Fanning, and Elisabeth Shue - and you have all the makings of a hit movie, I don't really care how well it did or didn't do at the box office.This movie is based on a true story, the dialogue is engrossing, and who doesn't think Dakota Fanning isn't a doll to watch in any movie.  She's like a modern-day Shirley Temple with talent.The original script had a boy playing Cale Crane.  I'm so glad that changed.  Fanning was perfect for this role.The movie addresses a lot of difficult subjects:  racism, class envy, father and son relationships, etc.  And I think that makes the movie a success; these little side-stories fill in the movie quite well.Kris Kristofferson has never been one of my favorite actors, and I can never get past him playing any other role than Abraham Whistler from the ""Blade"" trilogy.  Naturally I wish another person had played his role in this film - the father of Kurt Russell's character.All and all, I would some up ""Dreamer"" as an excellent DVD to add to your collection.

Dakota Fanning's enthusiasm and unfathomable confidence can be a lesson to those watching this remarkable film. There were a few scenes where her eyes gleamed with excitement. There were a few scenes where her smile lit up the screen.Yet, this movie also shows no argument with parents, even though a child may feel disappointment. (What a refreshing message!) She cried, she retreated, she even wanted to run away.For a child to discover what's in their blood and to have parents who recognize their unique love (in this case for a horse) is paramount to emotional health.

Though the story's pattern is a well used and familiar one, Gatins has created a strong story and graced it with a fine cast, and though we know from the outset what the ending will be, it is the getting there that is the pleasure of this very watchable film.Ben Crane (Kurt Russell) lives on a once famous Kentucky horse farm, a farm where he and his father Pop Crane (Kris Kristofferson) once bred racehorses.  Now the farm is horseless and Ben simply works as a trainer.  His disappointment in his life situation is reflected in his relative neglect of his wife Lily (Elizabeth Shue), who works as a waitress to make ends meet, and of his daughter Cale (Dakota Fanning).  His life is further encumbered when he advises his boss Palmer (David Morse) that the horse he has trained is not ready for a race and Palmer forces Ben to race the horse only to have the horse Sonador break a leg.  Ben is devastated, Palmer fires Ben and offers Ben severance pay of $6000. plus ownership of Sanador, saving the injured horse from being put down.  This seemingly bottoming out of Ben's career results in his winning his family back: Cale and Ben's faithful workers Balon (Luis Guzman) and ex-jockey badly injured in his past Manolin (Freddy Rodriguez) all work to restore Sanador's health.  Together they nurse Sonya AKA Sanador back to being able to run and reunite the fractured family all in the cause of creating a new life through faith and renewed familial bonding. Sanador is entered in a low level race and while she doesn't win, she demonstrates her viability as a racehorse.  Evil Palmer attempts to buy back the healed Sanador, but Ben has 'sold' the horse to Cale who decides to refuse the buy and proceeds to race Sanador in the Breeder's Cup race - of course winning.What could have been a sugary weeper of a story is brought to a fine level of reality by the fine cast. Fred Murphy is the superb cinematographer, John Debney continues his sterling reputation of composing fine musical scores, and Gatins pulls it all together.  DREAMER may be a family movie, but it is one with enough finesse to please just about every viewer.

172912,A2HVL790PBWYTU,1417030976,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 5]","Dreamer was inspired by the true story of Mariah's Storm, a racehorse who suffered thru the same severe injury as Sonador and, astonishingly, went on to win more horse races. Screenwriter/Director John Gatins had originally intended a boy to play Dakota Fanning's role, until he went and saw Man on Fire and knew he had to get Dakota for his movie. How's that for a testimony on your acting skills? And she's only 10 years old! Dreamer - Inspired By a True Story is excellent, heartwarming family fare. If the film makers crafted this film with the intention of creating a classic, they succeeded.The story tells of the estranged Crane family, who has been going thru the motions as a family. Ben Crane (Kurt Russell), the father, is too consumed with his work as a second hand horse trainer to spend much time with his neglected wife Lily (Elisabeth Shue - Rrrrrrr!) and their precocious daughter Cale (Dakota Fanning). Ben has also been on the outs with his own dad ""Pop"" (the ever grizzled Kris Kristofferson). Director John Gatins introduces a chestnut thoroughbred filly named Sonador and uses her as the means of bridging all the rifts in their relationships. Sonador's nickname is Sonia, though, in Spanish, Sonador translates to Dreamer.Ben Crane had just gotten fired due to his succoring an injured filly, who had suffered a devastating leg injury whilst on her way to winning a race. With no job and with expenses continuing to mount, events seem to spiral downhill for the Cranes. Even the hope that Sonador will make money thru breeding is dashed when she is proclaimed infertile. Ben is just about at his wits' end when, ultimately, it is young Cale herself who accidentally starts to turn things around for the Cranes, for the better. The remainder of the film divulges the twists and turns this horse-training family undergoes, as the storyline builds to a crescendo with the unlikely entry of Sonador into the prestigious Breeders' Cup Classic.There are obvious echoes of the awesome Seabiscuit film in Dreamer. Dreamer, too, is about an injured underdog racehorse who goes on to beat the odds. Like Seabiscuit, Dreamer also is about the coming together of people who were fractured. As Sonador is rehabilitated, so, too, is the alienated Crane family healed. Another tie which Dreamer has with Seabiscuit is that horse wranglers  Rusty Hendrickson and Rex Peterson worked the horse sequences on both films. In terms of texture and resonance, another film that this one reminds me of is National Velvet. Young Elizabeth Taylor and Dakota Fanning seem to be cut from the same talented mold.This movie is all about hope. And hope is personified, above all others, in Cale Crane, as enchantingly played by Fanning. The secret's been out for some time now that Dakota Fanning can act well - and not just well for a youngster. It's weird to say this about someone so young, but Fanning has such an open, organic style to her acting. I truly anticipate more good things from her. While the entire cast is across the board excellent, it is Fanning and Russell - a child actor and a former child actor - who anchor the film. These two seemed to share a father-daughter chemistry which made them a delight to watch in their scenes together. Kurt Russell puts in a low keyed, nuanced performance as a disillusioned horse trainer who, because of Cale and her filly, finds the courage to hope and dream big again.The Special Features include the featurettes ""Who is Mariah's Storm?"" (about the racehorse who inspired Dreamer), ""On the Set - Working with Thoroughbreds"" & ""Taking Care of Horses"" (both segments are about what it's like working with the horses), ""Meet the Dreamer Dream Cast"" (focus on the film cast), 2 deleted scenes, film commentary by Director/Writer John Gatins, a 9-minute long segment from the live sports show ""Trackside Live"" with guest John Gatins, and the music video ""Dreamer"" by Bethany Dillon.Dreamer works as a layered generational story, a root-for-the-underdog tale, and as a sensitive family drama. It is sentimental, syrupy sweet, and it deliberately works to tug at your heartstrings (wait 'til you hear the classroom story Cale wrote). And, yes, it's even, at times, cliched. But, to me, it's a perfect movie. A classic, in fact.",5,"""She wasn't just some racehorse.

172928,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,1417030976,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","Well, here's a big surprise--""Dreamer"" holds no surprises. It's an oft told tale--girl finds horse, girl loses horse, girl gets horse back, and together they can be legends! The horse in question here is a racing champion who breaks a leg. Instead of putting it down, the girl and her father save and mend it. When that goes exceedingly well, all hopes return to making a racing champion once again.The girl in question is Dakota Fanning. Gosh, who's going to root against her? While this is not my favorite Fanning performance, I am awed by her talent in general. I still think it's criminal that she was overlooked for an Emmy nomination for ""Taken"" and an Oscar nomination for the horrendous ""I Am Sam"" (a film she all but holds together due to a ridiculously over-the-top performance by the nominated Sean Penn).Kurt Russell is her dour father learning to believe again. He's fine. But in two underwritten roles, I did like what Elisabeth Shue and Kris Kristofferson have to contribute. They bring some of the less obvious moments of pleasure to the film.Not content to just play the underdog story of the horse, the film also throws in a damaged jockey that needs to be rehabilitated. For even more dramatic effect, in the title race he almost falls off the horse. Now, I'm not going to spoil any surprises--so you'll just have to watch the film to see how this unlikely duo will fare (but let's just say they start out in a distant last place). But that's not all--""Dreamer"" offers more than just these two underdog stories--oh, yes! This piece has a true villain, as well. In easily the film's (and perhaps last year's) most thankless performance is the talented David Morse. He disregards the safety of the horses, humiliates and fires Russell, displays racist condescension and publicly mocks a little girl. He glowers at everything and resorts to sabotage, when in truth--I don't think he'd be threatened by our heroic team. And Morse all but twirls his mustache and cackles maniacally in a totally unnecessary and unrealistic portrait.No matter how you slice it up--people are going to love this story as much as every other similar story that came before. To not is to be a cold hearted jerk. I didn't buy into everything wholeheartedly, but it's decent family fare. It's cozy, safe, predictable and uplifting--non-challenging cinema at it's best.

However, a child's dreams can be counterintuitive to sound business decisions. DREAMER portrays a precocious child, Cale (Dakota Fanning), that overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to achieve multiple triumphs. Her father, Ben Crane (Kurt Russell), initially views Cale as an impediment to his work. After Ben does everything he can to salvage a lame horse's value, he realizes that the best person to decide the animal's fate is his young daughter.The overall plot is somewhat far fetched though based on a true story (about a different horse with a varied outcome). The language is clean for the most part (one use of h*ll) and there is no violence (besides falling off a horse), making this appropriate entertainment for an entire family.

172930,A2NJO6YE954DBH,1417030976,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","The horse race at the end of ""Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story"" is something of an anticlimax, because I discovered that at least from my view in the grandstand this was not a movie about a girl and her horse.  That of course, is how ""Dreamer"" was sold, and when you have Dakota Fanning in a film you know that she is going to steal scenes right and left, especially if she is working with a horse.  In fact, when Kurt Russell's name popped up first in the credits my immediate thought was that they should just put Fanning first because she is the star.  But the big emotional moments in this film do not come from Fanning; they come from Russell.Ben Crane (Russell) is a horse trainer working for a rich jerk named Palmer (David Morse).  They are working with a two-year-old filly named So'ador (Spanish for ""dreamy"" apparently), and Ben does not think the horse should run.  Palmer is working with Saudi princes so he forces the issue and the horse breaks a leg.  The track vet wants to put the horse down, but when Ben looks up his daughter Cale (Fanning) is there, her eyes wide, and he cannot do it.  What happens costs him his job, but as part of his impromptu severance package he gets the damaged horse.Now, the main plotline of the film is that Cale wants to take care of So'ador and believes that the horse will be able to run again.  Part of this is wishful thinking by a little girl, but Cale is third generation when it comes to working with horses and playing wise beyond her years is a piece of cake for Fanning.  But what happens with the horse is pretty much predictable from start to finish line, and what I found compelling was the story of fathers and their kids.  Pop Crane (Kris Kristofferson) is still around, and while he thinks Ben's decision not to put down the injured horse was a mistake, the fact his son actually took a stand starts to thaw their relationship.  At the same time, Ben and Kale are moving towards having a stronger relationship, which only starts to happen when she becomes the owner of the horse and hires him to be the trainer.It is good to see Fanning doing her required horse film and ""Dreamer"" is just another example of why she is the most sought after pre-teen actress since Shirley Temple (she has already bested every other contender in between).  Put Fanning in a room with adults and she more than holds her own.  But watch dreamer and the two best moments both involve Russell.  The first is when he goes to Parents Night at Cale's school and the teacher has him stand up and read the story his daughter has written.  It is a story about a king in a castle who needs a magic horse to restore his kingdom, and as Ben reads it the metaphors fade away and he realizes what Cale is saying to him (the camera moves in slowly on Russell as he reads).  ""Can we keep these?"" he asks the teacher when he is finished, and you just know this guy is going to be buried with that story in his casket.The second memorable moment comes during the race, when the horses are galloping around the track, and Ben turns to look at his daughter watching the race.  At that point the horse does not matter and neither does the race, because Ben has everything he wants in watching his daughter.  Actually, that is not quite true, because the point at which Ben has everything is when he feels his father's hand on his shoulder.  His attention will be drawn back to the race, but this movie has found its happy ending well before it fades to black.The ""Inspired by a True Story"" part of the title really does not matter than much.  Writer-director John Gatins had come up with a story about a race horse that comes back from a potentially crippling injury and when he shared it with those in horse racing they all mentioned the real story of Mariah's Storm, who came back from a back injury to win a bunch of races (but not the Breeder's Cup).  So what is ""true"" here is that a horse can come back from a broken shinbone.  Of course, post ""Seabiscuit"" America's movie goers should have no problem accepting this tale.",4,"In this horse race, it turns out to be Kurt Russell's movie more than Dakota Fanning's",1143158400,"03 24, 2006",2006,4053,"['horse', 'race', 'end', 'Dreamer', 'Inspired', 'True', 'Story', 'something', 'anticlimax', 'discovered', 'least', 'view', 'grandstand', 'was', 'not', 'movie', 'girl', 'horse', 'course', 'how', 'Dreamer', 'was', 'sold', 'when', 'have', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'film', 'know', 'going', 'steal', 'scenes', 'right', 'left', 'especially', 'working', 'horse', 'fact', 'when', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'name', 'popped', 'up', 'first', 'credits', 'immediate', 'thought', 'was', 'should', 'just', 'put', 'Fanning', 'first', 'star', 'big', 'emotional', 'moments', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'Fanning', 'come', 'Russell.Ben', 'Crane', 'Russell', 'horse', 'trainer', 'working', 'rich', 'jerk', 'named', 'Palmer', 'David', 'Morse', 'are', 'working', 'two-year-old', 'filly', 'named', ""So'ador"", 'Spanish', 'dreamy', 'apparently', 'Ben', 'not', 'think', 'horse', 'should', 'run', 'Palmer', 'working', 'Saudi', 'princes', 'so', 'issue', 'horse', 'leg', 'track', 'vet', 'put', 'horse', 'down', 'when', 'Ben', 'up', 'daughter', 'Cale', 'Fanning', 'there', 'eyes', 'wide', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'What', 'job', 'part', 'impromptu', 'severance', 'package', 'damaged', 'horse.Now', 'main', 'plotline', 'film', 'Cale', 'take', 'care', ""So'ador"", 'horse', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'run', 'again', 'Part', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'little', 'girl', 'Cale', 'third', 'generation', 'when', 'working', 'horses', 'playing', 'wise', 'years', 'piece', 'cake', 'Fanning', 'what', 'horse', 'pretty', 'much', 'predictable', 'start', 'finish', 'line', 'what', 'found', 'compelling', 'was', 'story', 'fathers', 'kids', 'Pop', 'Crane', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'still', 'around', 'Ben', 'decision', 'not', 'put', 'down', 'injured', 'horse', 'was', 'mistake', 'fact', 'son', 'actually', 'took', 'stand', 'thaw', 'relationship', 'same', 'time', 'Ben', 'Kale', 'are', 'moving', 'towards', 'having', 'stronger', 'relationship', 'only', 'happen', 'when', 'owner', 'horse', 'be', 'trainer.It', 'good', 'see', 'Fanning', 'doing', 'required', 'horse', 'film', 'Dreamer', 'just', 'example', 'why', 'most', 'sought', 'pre-teen', 'actress', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'already', 'bested', 'other', 'contender', 'Put', 'Fanning', 'room', 'adults', 'more', 'own', 'watch', 'dreamer', 'two', 'best', 'moments', 'involve', 'Russell', 'first', 'when', 'Parents', 'Night', 'Cale', 'school', 'teacher', 'stand', 'up', 'read', 'story', 'daughter', 'written', 'story', 'king', 'castle', 'who', 'magic', 'horse', 'restore', 'kingdom', 'Ben', 'metaphors', 'fade', 'away', 'what', 'Cale', 'saying', 'camera', 'slowly', 'Russell', 'Can', 'keep', 'teacher', 'when', 'finished', 'just', 'know', 'guy', 'going', 'be', 'buried', 'story', 'casket.The', 'second', 'memorable', 'moment', 'race', 'when', 'horses', 'are', 'galloping', 'track', 'Ben', 'look', 'daughter', 'watching', 'race', 'point', 'horse', 'not', 'matter', 'race', 'Ben', 'everything', 'watching', 'daughter', 'Actually', 'not', 'quite', 'true', 'point', 'Ben', 'everything', 'when', 'father', 'hand', 'shoulder', 'attention', 'will', 'be', 'drawn', 'back', 'race', 'movie', 'found', 'happy', 'ending', 'well', 'black.The', 'Inspired', 'True', 'Story', 'part', 'title', 'really', 'not', 'matter', 'much', 'Writer-director', 'John', 'Gatins', 'had', 'come', 'up', 'story', 'race', 'horse', 'back', 'potentially', 'crippling', 'injury', 'when', 'shared', 'horse', 'racing', 'mentioned', 'real', 'story', 'Mariah', 'Storm', 'who', 'came', 'back', 'back', 'injury', 'win', 'bunch', 'races', 'not', 'Breeder', 'Cup', 'what', 'true', 'here', 'horse', 'can', 'come', 'back', 'broken', 'shinbone', 'course', 'post', 'Seabiscuit', 'America', 'movie', 'goers', 'should', 'have', 'problem', 'accepting', 'tale']",N/A

Billed as a ""family film"", ""Dreamer"" does have some of that corniness that I've come to associate with films that are ostensibly made for children, but it is elevated by a superb cast who make the film enjoyable for adults as well. When horse trainer Ben Crane (Kurt Russell) is fired by his arrogant boss Everett Palmer (David Morse), Ben takes an injured horse, Sonador, as part of his severance pay, with the intention of breeding Sonador with a champion for profit. Ben and his two assistants, Balon (Luis Guzman) and ex-jockey Manolin (Freddie Rodriguez), set about getting the horse's leg to heal so that she can breed, while the Crane family hopes their precarious finances will hold out that long. In the meanwhile, Ben's daughter Cale (Dakota Fanning) has fallen in love with Sonador, and when things don't go as planned, Cale's lofty ambitions to race the horse in the Breeders' Cup Classic might be the silver lining in the Crane's dark cloud.""Dreamer"" is plagued by clich&eacute;s and details that don't make sense, but it is all forgivable thanks to a very credible cast and racing scenes that succeed in getting the audience on the edge of its seat better than any other horse-racing film I have seen. Dakota Fanning provides the star power and energy that drives the story, while Kurt Russell grounds the film in reality with skepticism and reticence. This is writer/director John Gatins first stab at directing, and, although his script may be faulted for being too saccharine in places, his directing is most effective. It helps that Gatins knows horses and horse-racing well, so he's comfortable with the material. ""Inspired by a True Story"" was tacked onto the film's title out of necessity, since another studio owned the title ""Dreamer"". This film is entirely fiction. But there was a horse named ""Mariah's Storm"" who recovered from a broken leg to have a successful racing career, so she is the ""true story"" to which the title refers. ""Dreamer"" is obviously a contrived feel-good, and sometimes feel-bad, story that never pretends to be otherwise. But it has the emotional authenticity and excitement that make such a story enjoyable -for young and old.The DVD (Dreamworks 2006): Bonus features include 5 featurettes, 2 deleted scenes, a ""Music Video Featuring Bethany Dillon"" (3 min), and an audio commentary by director John Gatins. ""Who Is Mariah's Storm?"" (5 min) is a bio of the horse referred to in the film as having had the same injury as Sonador. ""On the Set: Working with Thoroughbreds"" (11 min) includes interviews with horse wranglers Rusty Hendrickson and Rex Peterson, discussion of the horses that played Sonador, and filming the race scenes. ""Taking Care of Horses"" (5  min) shows the daily routine of grooming a horse, for young girls. ""Meet the Dreamer Dream Cast"" (17 min) includes interviews with the cast, director John Gatins, and director of photography Fred Murphy, in which they talk about characters, story, and working with each other. ""Trackside Live Dreamer Segment"" (9 min) is a television broadcast from Oaktree Santa Anita, in which a sportscaster interviews John Gatins trackside about the upcoming film. John Gatins' feature audio commentary includes a lot of technical details of how scenes were created and filmed, as well as scene-by-scene comments on locations, characters, and story. It's an informative commentary without lulls. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, French.

172944,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,1417030976,MollyRK,"[2, 2]","Anyone out there who is a sucker for a sweet, simple movie need not look any further than Dakota Fanning's most recent film, ""Dreamer."" As other reviewers here have said, the story is genuinely heartfelt, the scenery is beautiful and the general tone is ideal for a movie to enjoy with the family.As we all know, 11-year-old Dakota Fanning has fashioned an impressively long string of films since she first broke out with ""I Am Sam"" at age 6, and after starring in three horror/action flicks in a row (Man On Fire, Hide and Seek, and War of the Worlds), it was nice to see her return to the family genre for younger crowds. She did an incredible job here, of course, and worked very well alongside Kurt Russell.One thing that really did surprise me, though, was how low-key Dakota's performance was with this film. She couldn't have spoken more than about ten words in the film's first thirty minutes, and throughout the rest of the movie she seemed to be speaking more through those big blue eyes of hers, rather than verbal dialogue. After getting quite a bit of heat in ""War of the Worlds"" this past summer for shrieking and crying throughout the movie's duration (her past few movie scripts, for that matter, have called for quite a bit of screaming), you may be surprised to see how soft and delicate her dialogue is in ""Dreamer."" Her role as a sweet, mild-tempered, and shy young girl is one that actually has her speaking much less than she does in her other movies, but her quiet and innocent presence works perfectly with her character. After having to put forth so much emotion and wear a scared face in her previous roles, she gets an opportunity to play a much quieter part and pulls it off beautifully, reaffirming her incredible diversity as an actress.I would highly recommend this film to all Dakota fans, as well as those who would be happy with a movie that literally makes you smile. That's the kind of plot that is used from the very beginning, leading up to a fantastic ending that is cliche, yes, but very much the kind of satisfying conclusion we all love.",5,another terrific success for Ms. Fanning,1144368000,"04 7, 2006",2006,2079,"['Anyone', 'who', 'sucker', 'sweet', 'simple', 'movie', 'need', 'not', 'look', 'further', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'most', 'recent', 'film', 'Dreamer', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'said', 'story', 'genuinely', 'heartfelt', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'general', 'tone', 'ideal', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'family.As', 'know', '11-year-old', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'fashioned', 'impressively', 'long', 'string', 'films', 'first', 'broke', 'out', 'Am', 'Sam', 'age', '6', 'starring', 'three', 'horror/action', 'flicks', 'row', 'Man', 'Fire', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'War', 'Worlds', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'return', 'family', 'genre', 'younger', 'crowds', 'did', 'incredible', 'job', 'here', 'course', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'Kurt', 'Russell.One', 'thing', 'really', 'did', 'surprise', 'though', 'was', 'how', 'low-key', 'Dakota', 'performance', 'was', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'spoken', 'more', 'about', 'ten', 'words', 'film', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'rest', 'movie', 'seemed', 'be', 'speaking', 'more', 'big', 'blue', 'eyes', 'hers', 'rather', 'verbal', 'dialogue', 'getting', 'quite', 'bit', 'heat', 'War', 'Worlds', 'past', 'summer', 'shrieking', 'crying', 'movie', 'duration', 'past', 'few', 'movie', 'scripts', 'matter', 'have', 'called', 'quite', 'bit', 'screaming', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'see', 'how', 'soft', 'delicate', 'dialogue', 'Dreamer', 'role', 'sweet', 'mild-tempered', 'shy', 'young', 'girl', 'one', 'actually', 'speaking', 'much', 'less', 'other', 'movies', 'quiet', 'innocent', 'presence', 'perfectly', 'character', 'having', 'put', 'forth', 'so', 'much', 'emotion', 'wear', 'scared', 'face', 'previous', 'roles', 'opportunity', 'play', 'much', 'quieter', 'part', 'off', 'beautifully', 'reaffirming', 'incredible', 'diversity', 'actress.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'Dakota', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'movie', 'literally', 'smile', 'kind', 'plot', 'used', 'very', 'beginning', 'leading', 'up', 'fantastic', 'ending', 'cliche', 'yes', 'very', 'much', 'kind', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'love']",N/A

I'm always on the lookout for good family movies that I can watch with my granddaughter and great nieces and nephews...movies that display the values I feel are important in my family's lives and show, in action and words, a way of life the children in my life to pattern their lives.  This movie fits the bill!I watched the movie with a 13, 10, 5, 64 and 65 year old...and it was enjoyed by all.  The kids were entranced with the horse and racing, of course, but also loved the way the Dad and little girl's relationship improved.  They loved watching the little girl take the lead in working hard to make a dream come true and understood how this helped heal the relationship between the father and grandfather as well.It taught us &#34;older&#34; children to remember our dreams and still fight for them and to remember to instill dreams in our children and help them grow into working for those dreams and following them.As in life, there are some harsh scenes that made the young ones cry and ask, &#34;is she going to die&#34;...scary, sad scenes about scary, sad things that happen, so parents and grandparents, be prepared to help.I would definitely buy this product again and recommend it for others.  The casting was great.  Dakota Fanning had good &#34;attitude&#34; and Kurt Russell and father, Kris Kristofferson looked and acted like they were father/son in real life.

There were no real surprises as far as the main plot points were concerned, however, this is not really a criticism with this particular film, as what makes it work are the uniformly good to excellent performances of all the main characters.As an aside, the films subtitle, ""Inspired by a True Story,"" is correct; the horses name was ""Mariah's Storm,"" and she won the 1995 Breeders' Cup after breaking her leg, an event that usually results in the poor animal being put-down on the track.Dakota Fanning is scarily good as always, Kurt Russell puts in a solid, believable performance as her dad, and an impossibly grizzled Kris Kristofferson ambles and growls his way through the movie as her grandfather. A pleasant surprise was David Morse, probably best known to most of us as TV's ""Hack,"" in a decidedly unsympathetic role, one which he pulls off with great aplomb.I only have a couple of major criticisms, there's a pivotal plot point concerning what appears to be the forced sale of Dreamer, called a ""claim,"" after a race, midway through the film, which left me, my girlfriend, and I'm sure most of the rest of the audience not intimately involved in the racing world, completely bemused, as the process is never explained. Secondly, the family farm is, apparently, the only horse farm in Kentucky with no horses; this is obviously tied to something really BAD that happened to Kristofferson's character many years ago, but again, is left unexplained.The good points are, as I said, the performances of Fanning, Russell, Kristofferson, and Morse; these really carry the film along and go an awful long way to letting you forgive the formulaic plotting. Another plus is the filming of the race sequences themselves; the camera seems to get right in amongst the horses as they thunder around the track, and there're a couple of tight overhead shots that really give you a feel for the speed and closeness of the action taking place.All in all this is a very pleasant way to spend 100 minutes or so; go for the performances - Fanning blows everyone off the screen AGAIN! - and the race sequences, and you won't be disappointed. The film is decidedly family-friendly, although the sequence where Dreamer breaks a leg at the beginning MAY be upsetting for some children.",4,Follow your dreams...,1129939200,"10 22, 2005",2005,2410,"['was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'see', 'advanced', 'screening', 'film', 'LA', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'can', 'best', 'describe', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'were', 'real', 'surprises', 'as', 'far', 'main', 'plot', 'points', 'were', 'concerned', 'however', 'not', 'really', 'criticism', 'particular', 'film', 'what', 'are', 'uniformly', 'good', 'excellent', 'performances', 'main', 'characters.As', 'aside', 'films', 'subtitle', 'Inspired', 'True', 'Story', 'correct', 'horses', 'name', 'was', 'Mariah', 'Storm', 'won', '1995', 'Breeders', 'Cup', 'breaking', 'leg', 'event', 'usually', 'results', 'poor', 'animal', 'being', 'put-down', 'track.Dakota', 'Fanning', 'scarily', 'good', 'always', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'solid', 'believable', 'performance', 'dad', 'impossibly', 'grizzled', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'ambles', 'growls', 'way', 'movie', 'grandfather', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'was', 'David', 'Morse', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'most', 'TV', 'Hack', 'decidedly', 'unsympathetic', 'role', 'one', 'great', 'aplomb.I', 'only', 'have', 'couple', 'major', 'criticisms', 'pivotal', 'plot', 'point', 'concerning', 'what', 'be', 'forced', 'sale', 'Dreamer', 'called', 'claim', 'race', 'midway', 'film', 'left', 'girlfriend', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'rest', 'audience', 'not', 'intimately', 'involved', 'racing', 'world', 'completely', 'bemused', 'process', 'never', 'explained', 'Secondly', 'family', 'farm', 'apparently', 'only', 'horse', 'farm', 'Kentucky', 'horses', 'obviously', 'tied', 'something', 'really', 'BAD', 'happened', 'Kristofferson', 'character', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'again', 'left', 'unexplained.The', 'good', 'points', 'are', 'said', 'performances', 'Fanning', 'Russell', 'Kristofferson', 'Morse', 'really', 'carry', 'film', 'go', 'awful', 'long', 'way', 'letting', 'forgive', 'formulaic', 'plotting', 'filming', 'race', 'camera', 'get', 'right', 'amongst', 'horses', 'thunder', 'track', 'there', ""'re"", 'couple', 'tight', 'overhead', 'shots', 'really', 'give', 'feel', 'speed', 'closeness', 'action', 'taking', 'place.All', 'very', 'pleasant', 'way', 'spend', '100', 'minutes', 'so', 'go', 'performances', 'Fanning', 'blows', 'everyone', 'screen', 'AGAIN', 'race', 'sequences', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'decidedly', 'family-friendly', 'sequence', 'where', 'Dreamer', 'leg', 'beginning', 'MAY', 'be', 'upsetting', 'children']",N/A

I like Dakota Fanning and think she is a very talented young actress.  But I don't know why her parents and/or agent signed her on for this movie.  The idea is that after a bad accident on the track, a horse named Sonjador is bought and cared for by Kurt Russell and his family (his daughter is Dakota Fanning).  They nurse the horse back to health with the intent of racing her again.  I have no problem with that portion of the movie.  It's the earlier part when they intend to breed the horse in order to hopefully spawn a young champion to sell.  Too much blatant sexual discussion of intercourse between the stud and Sonjador, right in front of Dakota Fanning who's character must be having a tough time figuring out what they're talking about.  Plus I detected an almost subliminal theme of lechery running throughout the movie as many older male characters make very thinly veiled advances towards young Fanning (even by her grandfather, played by the otherwise reliable Kris Krisstofferson).  Basically I believe the movie is well-made enough for adults (and probably older teens), but like Disney's animated ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" this movie is too much for the kids.",3,Questionable for younger viewers,1144108800,"04 4, 2006",2006,1271,"['word', 'warning', 'wannabe-parent', 'movie', ""n't"", 'designed', 'children', 'mind', 'like', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'think', 'very', 'talented', 'young', 'actress', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'parents', 'and/or', 'agent', 'signed', 'movie', 'idea', 'bad', 'accident', 'track', 'horse', 'named', 'Sonjador', 'bought', 'cared', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'family', 'daughter', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'nurse', 'horse', 'back', 'health', 'intent', 'racing', 'again', 'have', 'problem', 'portion', 'movie', 'earlier', 'part', 'when', 'intend', 'breed', 'horse', 'order', 'hopefully', 'spawn', 'young', 'champion', 'sell', 'Too', 'much', 'blatant', 'sexual', 'discussion', 'intercourse', 'stud', 'Sonjador', 'right', 'front', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'who', 'character', 'must', 'be', 'having', 'tough', 'time', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'detected', 'almost', 'subliminal', 'theme', 'lechery', 'running', 'movie', 'many', 'older', 'male', 'characters', 'make', 'very', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'advances', 'towards', 'young', 'Fanning', 'even', 'grandfather', 'played', 'otherwise', 'reliable', 'Kris', 'Krisstofferson', 'Basically', 'believe', 'movie', 'well-made', 'enough', 'adults', 'probably', 'older', 'teens', 'Disney', 'animated', 'Hunchback', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'kids']",N/A

172974,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,1417030976,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story"" might easily remind you of another based-on-real-life-event film about horse race, ""Seabiscuit."" The biggest difference is that ""Dreamer"" helmed by the first-time director John Gatins (who wrote the script of Keanu Reeves' ""Hard Ball"") takes a more straightforward approach to the underdog theme. The result is a family picture that, though formulaic and predictable, is still engaging and heart-warming with the superb acting from the cast. And the titular horse is also good.The story is loosely based on a real-life racing horse named ""Mariah's Storm,"" who broke her cannon bone in 1993, but kept winning the races after miraculously coming back from the near fatal injury. The film changed the horse's name to more romantic ""Sonador"" (meaning Dreamer), and changed many other things too, but the results remain a very moving film with effective acting all around.Dakota Fanning, busiest actresses in the world (child or adult), plays Cale Crane, daughter of the horse trainer Ben Crane (Kurt Russell). After the terrible accident that happened to Sonador, a promising race horse, they save the life of the severely injured mare, and bring her to their house, where the daughter starts to take care of her.There is a greedy horse owner (David Morse); one jockey who once gave up his dream (Freddy Rodriguez); quiet and gritty grandfather `Pop' Crane (Kris Kristofferson), and patient and understanding Lily (Elizabeth Shue). Plus you can see Luis Guzm&aacute;n and Oded Fehr, and their roles are not surprising ones. Actually, everyone in the film is typecast, but the unanimously good acting from the cast makes us almost forget the fact. Just almost.The strength of the film, besides the fine performances from the actors, is the credible and thrilling race scenes. The graceful beauty of the horse is also attractive.But above all, we are attracted to the ""True Story"" simply because it tells a good story with skills and confidence. The actors also know that they are part of that good story, and look proud of that. True, it is a bit too good, but is also a very moving one.",4,"Sonador, the Dreamer: Inspirational Family Picture",1149811200,"06 9, 2006",2006,2118,"['Dreamer', 'Inspired', 'True', 'Story', 'might', 'easily', 'remind', 'based-on-real-life-event', 'film', 'horse', 'race', 'Seabiscuit', 'biggest', 'difference', 'Dreamer', 'helmed', 'first-time', 'director', 'John', 'Gatins', 'who', 'wrote', 'script', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Hard', 'Ball', 'more', 'straightforward', 'approach', 'underdog', 'theme', 'result', 'family', 'picture', 'formulaic', 'predictable', 'still', 'engaging', 'heart-warming', 'superb', 'acting', 'cast', 'titular', 'horse', 'also', 'good.The', 'story', 'loosely', 'based', 'real-life', 'racing', 'horse', 'named', 'Mariah', 'Storm', 'who', 'broke', 'cannon', 'bone', '1993', 'kept', 'winning', 'races', 'miraculously', 'coming', 'back', 'near', 'fatal', 'injury', 'film', 'changed', 'horse', 'name', 'more', 'romantic', 'Sonador', 'meaning', 'Dreamer', 'changed', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'too', 'results', 'remain', 'very', 'moving', 'film', 'effective', 'acting', 'around.Dakota', 'Fanning', 'busiest', 'actresses', 'world', 'child', 'adult', 'Cale', 'Crane', 'daughter', 'horse', 'trainer', 'Ben', 'Crane', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'terrible', 'accident', 'happened', 'Sonador', 'promising', 'race', 'horse', 'save', 'life', 'severely', 'injured', 'mare', 'bring', 'house', 'where', 'daughter', 'take', 'care', 'her.There', 'greedy', 'horse', 'owner', 'David', 'Morse', 'one', 'jockey', 'who', 'once', 'gave', 'up', 'dream', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'quiet', 'gritty', 'grandfather', 'Pop', 'Crane', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'patient', 'understanding', 'Lily', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'can', 'see', 'Luis', 'Guzm', 'aacute', 'Oded', 'Fehr', 'roles', 'are', 'not', 'surprising', 'ones', 'Actually', 'everyone', 'film', 'typecast', 'unanimously', 'good', 'acting', 'cast', 'almost', 'forget', 'fact', 'Just', 'almost.The', 'strength', 'film', 'fine', 'performances', 'actors', 'credible', 'thrilling', 'race', 'scenes', 'graceful', 'beauty', 'horse', 'also', 'attractive.But', 'are', 'attracted', 'True', 'Story', 'simply', 'good', 'story', 'skills', 'confidence', 'actors', 'also', 'know', 'are', 'part', 'good', 'story', 'look', 'proud', 'True', 'bit', 'too', 'good', 'also', 'very', 'moving', 'one']",N/A

And the horse is adorable. April, 2011 update: Just saw it for a second time, this time via DVD. One mark of an effective film is whether or not, when you see it again, it can have the same emotional wallop. For me, the second time around with ""Dreamer"" the emotions are even larger.
