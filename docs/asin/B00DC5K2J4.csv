I watch all the BBC movies but this one is so different. Last night I almost fell of the couch laughing when some lady(a mother or ex-wife)threw this guy (who was beaten up really bad)out of her car, she didn't want him back, period.  Now, I suppose you are wondering why I would find that scene so funny? You have to watch the entire movie to find out why. In the same episode, we see 4 guys & a woman sitting in a livingroom, another scene to laugh at cause guy 1 is her ex-husband who wants to come back, guy 2 is her son, guy 3 is the guy who was thrown out of the car(her ex-lover) & guy 4 is a character who wants her. What more could one want?? OK, how about the scene where the guy, thrown out of the car, falls down the stairway. HONEST, you have to get this movie, it's a one of a kind!

1654821,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00DC5K2J4,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[122, 128]","When I heard the initial concept of the new BBC series ""Last Tango in Halifax,"" I thought that it might be a cute romantic trifle.  What's not to like about a sweet late period romance with two senior citizens of the over seventy set finding love?  Despite the presence of the great Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid, I was afraid that the series might be too safe and too saccharine.  Somehow, I just feel like older characters receive very little respect in mainstream entertainment.  They are either cutesy or curmudgeonly (but still lovable) with little real world nuance or dimension.  A lot of recent movie hits featuring an older cast (Quartet, Best Exotic Marigold Hotel) have been pleasant escapism, but didn't really hold any surprises.  And as this six part series began, I still wasn't convinced.  Early episodes are indeed amusing and romantic.  But as the six episodes progress, the scope of the show expands to include a larger cast.  What's funny is that Jacobi and Reid might be the sanest of the bunch, it is their children that have real issues.Season One of ""Last Tango in Halifax"" achieved noteworthy ratings in its premiere run and has been commissioned for a second season.  The show also scored with major critics groups and won a BAFTA for Best Drama Series and Best Writing for Sally Wainwright.  Leads Reid and Jacobi both picked up acting nominations as did Sarah Lancashire in the Supporting category.  I think that the reason the show has been embraced with such enthusiasm is that it does thwart expectations.  The romance is handled sweetly but not condescendingly.  The plot twists are bold and almost farcical and yet oddly believable as well.  In only six episodes, you really feel like you go on a journey with this clan.  And despite a few missteps in the middle episodes, the season ends on an absolute high point.  I will surely be on hand for Season Two!  Part of the success has to do with the actors (which I will discuss a little later), but most has to do with the complex balancing act that Wainwright achieves with her teleplay.  In other hands, the outlandish turn of events might put me off but the writing adeptly balances humor with sentimentality.This late period romance begins of all places on Facebook.  Reid and Jacobi courted in the fifties, but have lost touch over the intervening decades.  When their grandchildren introduce them to social media, the have the chance to reconnect.  Despite everything that has happened, their teenage passion sparks again.  Whie we see the blossoming of something quite lovely, the series juxtaposes the niceties with the more complicated daily lives of their two daughters.  Jacobi's daughter Gillian (Nicola Walker) and Reid's daughter (Lancashire) are wildly different and they struggle to see how their parents courtship will fit into their lives.  I don't want to reveal too much about what happens, but Lancashire, in particular, is given some pretty hefty plot points and actually manages to steal scenes away from the more veteran actors.  I don't want to sell ""Last Tango in Halifax"" as lighthearted or inconsequential, its humor is leveled with much darkness as well.Part of the joy of a program like ""Last Tango in Halifax"" is that all the characters are well drawn and multi-dimensional from the leads down to the smallest supporting roles.  Jacobi (forever in my heart associated with I, Claudius) gives one of the more robust performances of his late years.  And Reid is perfection.  I've always liked Reid because she has an unexpected edge that I find refreshing.  If you haven't seen the sexually charged ""The Mother"" from 2003, where she graphically beds a pre-Bond Daniel Craig, you simply must.  I still think it should have been her Oscar nomination (but it is rather explicit and unexpected).  I also liked Walker, but Lancashire is a revelation.

Love this show, my favorite on PBS since Downton Abbey! I concur with much of the K. Harris review, but will add a few wrinkles of my own.  First of all, this show is honest.  People are flawed, life is complicated, and no one is one-dimensional. The writing is sublime.  The acting is wonderful, of course, starting with Reid and Jacobi.  I'm in love with them!  Who can resist their joy in finding each other after so many years? Reid's character has something of a bitter edge, but Jacobi's character accepts her unconditionally and tenderly. I loved their spirited discussions of religion and politics, while always knowing that their love is bigger than their differences. Their daughters are a mess, but such an intriguing mess! Their layered performances and changing relationships with each other, as well as other characters, are complex and fascinating.  Perhaps best of all, there are many moments of surprising black comedy that often make me laugh out loud, but may have eluded or offended some viewers. To me, it's a big part of what makes this show so special and unsentimental. My friend is as hooked as I am. So if you like lots of flavors in your viewing, with a big heart at the center, give this one a chance.Edited 10/17/2013.  Whoa, this show went haywire in the last two episodes of the season. My friend, who saw them separately, felt the same. (The episode prior was our favorite, after which I wrote the above review.)  Trying to do too much, seem too hip, what?  Sour, dark, and unlikeable is not the same as quirky, edgy, but warm . It's like all the plot lines went over some kind of line at the same time, and I found myself tensing in discomfort instead of laughing in empathy and delight.  Hope they get back on track again next season, or it's ruined for me.  4 Stars because the rest of the episodes are so  delightful.",4,Couldn't wait for the next episode until the last two!,1380672000,"10 2, 2013",2013,1980,"['Review', 'early', 'episodes', 'reviewer', 'said', 'good', 'show', 'longing', 'next', 'episode', 'Well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Love', 'show', 'favorite', 'PBS', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'concur', 'much', 'K.', 'Harris', 'review', 'will', 'add', 'few', 'wrinkles', 'own', 'First', 'all', 'show', 'honest', 'People', 'are', 'flawed', 'life', 'complicated', 'one', 'one-dimensional', 'writing', 'sublime', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'course', 'starting', 'Reid', 'Jacobi', ""'m"", 'love', 'Who', 'can', 'resist', 'joy', 'finding', 'other', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'Reid', 'character', 'something', 'bitter', 'edge', 'Jacobi', 'character', 'unconditionally', 'tenderly', 'loved', 'spirited', 'discussions', 'religion', 'politics', 'always', 'knowing', 'love', 'bigger', 'differences', 'daughters', 'are', 'mess', 'intriguing', 'mess', 'layered', 'performances', 'changing', 'relationships', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'complex', 'fascinating', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'surprising', 'black', 'comedy', 'often', 'make', 'loud', 'may', 'have', 'eluded', 'offended', 'viewers', 'big', 'part', 'what', 'show', 'so', 'special', 'unsentimental', 'friend', 'as', 'hooked', 'am', 'So', 'like', 'lots', 'flavors', 'viewing', 'big', 'heart', 'center', 'give', 'one', 'chance.Edited', '10/17/2013', 'Whoa', 'show', 'went', 'haywire', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'season', 'My', 'friend', 'who', 'saw', 'separately', 'felt', 'same', 'episode', 'prior', 'was', 'favorite', 'wrote', 'above', 'review', 'Trying', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'seem', 'too', 'hip', 'what', 'Sour', 'dark', 'unlikeable', 'not', 'same', 'quirky', 'edgy', 'warm', 'plot', 'lines', 'went', 'kind', 'line', 'same', 'time', 'found', 'tensing', 'discomfort', 'instead', 'laughing', 'empathy', 'delight', 'Hope', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'again', 'next', 'season', 'ruined', '4', 'Stars', 'rest', 'episodes', 'are', 'so', 'delightful']",Last Tango in Halifax

I liked her in both. She is completely real, loose and exceptional as an actor, with far more range here as Gillian.The actor who played her counterpart, the grwn daughter and headmistress of a posh high school, a 'big blond' named Caroline, also has some great lines and throws herself into them with crashing aplomb.These are all modern people. There is a lot of driving (from house to house 40 miles away), seeking of parking places, everyone with a cell phone. No one (except one unfortunate moment) has homophobia, racism or sexism when they might have shown up in another family. The three boy teenagers are great, likable and good actors -- I miss them all and look forward to seeing them next time.The grandfather, played by Derek Jacobi, is perfect as a witty, good person who speaks in a fetching Yorkshire dialect.The only misstep, I think, a downer, is the wrong turn one character takes beginning in the second to last episode.

All the actors are exceptional and the story is filled with many touching moments and several very humorous situations. I like all the performers but Nicola Walker is one of my favorites. I first saw her in MI5 ( or Spooks) and she was fantastic. This show is similar to ""As Time Goes By"" but in a more serious vein. There is a dark side to some of the characters whereas As Time Goes By was for the most part upbeat.

However, it is about love, sex, couples, children, anger and everything in-between.This series is based on a true story of writer Sally Wainwright's recollection of her mother's second marriage. This series tells a story of a man and a woman who reconnect via Facebook. Each of them had a crush on the other, which was more like love, 50 odd years ago and they meet up. Alan, played by Derek Jacobi, lives with his daughter, Gillian played by the wonderfully expressive, Nicola Walker, and his grandson Raff. They live on a sheep farm out in the country.Celia, played by Anne Reid was, unhappily married to a man who slept around. She, too lives with her daughter, Caroline, played by Sarah Lancashire, who is the Head of a public school near Yorkshire. They have money, and Caroline likes to think of herself as an upper class.The first meetings if the families, us for Alan and Celia to tell them they are getting married. No sense in waiting after all this time. That is fine, but both daughters are going through difficult times with the men in their lives and their children. This will not be easy combining both families. A lot of drama and laughs surround both families, you know the kind of drama we all have.Messes occur, people say uncouth things, they quarrel, they live, they laugh and cry.

The main characters are Alan and Celia who were at school together and had liked one another. Life got in the way seperating them for sixty years and by chance they happen to meet on Facebook. Leading to them rekindling their friendship and romance. There are a few twists and turns long the way though!They have adult children and grandchildren who are facing their own challenges. Celia's daughter Caroline has been a closet lesbian for over twenty years feeling she needed to conform to society's and her parent's wishes. While she did her best to love her husband he is a bit of a pill who went of with another woman, only to return home when things didn't go as planned . It is very refreshing  to see Caroline being true to herself.Alan's daughter Gillian has her own problems having lost her husband some ten years before who was an alcoholic and took his life.While these storylines may appear depressing they are just about a group of people living life.

1654856,A2H5W4UNFFE785,B00DC5K2J4,Steven Keller,"[18, 80]","A good television series leaves you longing for the next episode - that is the test.  Unfortunately, Last Tango in Halifax does not leave you longing for the next installment.  Based on an interesting premise, the plot revolves around two widowed seventy somethings who reconnect after sixty years.  Anne Reid and Derek Jacobi - great actors, who, in my opinion are out of their element, play the two.  The characters never sparkle, never shine.  That, I believe is the death knell; if an audience can't empathize with the leading characters, all is lost.The proceedings are so sour, so dreary, that after the episode ends one feels as if one has been slimed.  A dirty, grimy feeling pervades the whole thing.  To give the reader an example, the Anne Reid character gleefully tells her daughter that her friend Derek Jacobi has spent the night with her and that they engaged in sex.  The daughter is very uncomfortable, but the mother (Reid) proceeds to tell her that she had forgotten ""how great sex was!""  A scene that could have been funny and even charming turns out to be unseemly and leaves the viewer uncomfortable.Another scene has the Reid/Jacobi couple swearing and cursing inside a church.  Later they engage in a conversation about God that degenerates into a diatribe about religious people oppressing the masses!  I wonder how many viewers will be turned off just from this scene alone.Last Tango in Halifax tries to be politically correct to a fault; yes, it's a subtle political correctness, but nevertheless insidious - the message here is that the past was peopled by big, bad individuals who lived to put you in your place and now we live in such an enlightened time that we can do whatever we want.  Yet the characters are so miserable, and it is a misery of their own making, specifically because these people did whatever they wanted without thinking of the consequences.  There is nothing to like in the cast of selfish, peevish bores.  Again, an audience has to have empathy for the characters to make a series work.  Take Downton Abbey - the audience cares about the characters, empathizes with them, is interested in what they are going to do, feels sorry for them, and yes, even loves them.
