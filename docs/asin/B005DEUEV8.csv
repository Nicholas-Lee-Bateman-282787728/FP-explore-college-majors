1455429,A3DZ2907IDX7ME,B005DEUEV8,A Forest Fan,"[1, 3]","William Shatner was never noted for his skills as an interviewer, but that's okay. In this documentary, he speaks on a subject of personal interest to him, the captaincy of Star Trek. His first interview with Patrick Stewart starts off a little rocky, with Shatner not used to another being the subject. But he quickly warms to the task and gets some great dialogues going with Stewart and the other Trek captains. You can see our hero get more and more comfortable in this new role, it suits him.A good corollary to this documentary is the ""Shatner Rules"" book, made around the same time. But see this to join Scott Bakula, Kate Mulgrew, Avery Brooks, and of course Patrick Stewart as they go round and round with Shatner. It's a great journey of discovery, for us and them.But what of Shatner himself? He visits Christopher Plummer (Star Trek VI), who regales him with some insights with observing his fellow Canadian theater actor over the years. Their careers only crisscrossed again with that final classic Star Trek movie. This is a great adventure to see.Now we need a sequel: Shatner sitting down with the original Star Trek cast members, so they can tell him how they really feel. I imagine it would be cathartic for all involved.

1455430,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B005DEUEV8,A. Gammill,"[3, 5]","Like him or not, there's no denying the power of William Shatner.  Busier than ever at age 80, the former Captain James T. Kirk periodically continues his philosopic exploration of the Star Trek phenomenon.  Indeed, this is not the first video release in which Shatner delves deep into his most famous character (see alsoMind Meld - Secrets Behind the Voyage of a Lifetime).  But with ""The Captains,"" he brings along 4 other iconic actors from the franchise and engages them some candid conversations.As a longtime Star Trek fan, I always approach interview segments with the actors with a slight amount of trepidation.  The fact is, some of them have a tendency to repeat the same stories over and over.  Anyone who's ever sat through Nichelle Nichols' old chestnut of a story about how Martin Luther King Jr. talked her into not leaving the original series knows what I'm talking about.  Happily, this is mostly not the case with this documentary.  I only heard one story, from Patrick Stewart, that he used two years previously for the ""Captain's Summit"" Blu-ray disc.  The interviews with Kate Mulgrew and Scott Bakula are especially enlightening, although Mulgrew comes across far more pessimistic than the always-affable ""Enterprise"" star.  The film also puts Shatner face-to-face with the NEW Kirk, Chris Pine. Although their time together is limited, credit must be given to Pine for not engaging in anything resembling hero-worship, while Shatner shows some rare restraint by keeping his own ego in check.Ever the armchair psychologist, Shatner isn't afraid to ask the big questions.  Bakula admits that Quantum Leap's strenuous schedule helped end his marriage; an almost-tearful Stewart confides that he always placed his career above family obligations, even at the expense of two wives.  Mulgrew speaks of the pressures of being a single mother while working 12+ hour days on the set of ""Star Trek Voyager.""And then there's Avery Brooks (""Deep Space Nine""'s Capt. Sisko).  What to make of his extended odes to the rapturous wonders of jazz music (Brooks even non-answers several questions by tickling the ivories)?  Although his show remains the franchise's dark horse, Brooks himself is probably Shatner's heir apparent by virtue of his bug-eyed metaphysical countenance.  Seriously, there's nothing inTrekkiesto rival the unbridled weirdness of Brooks' interview segments.""The Captains,"" even with a few flaws, ultimately represents a true time capsule for anyone in the future who might wonder just what all the fuss was about those ""Star Trek"" shows and movies.  As he did in ""Mind Meld,"" William Shatner sees Death coming for him...sooner rather than later.  And while this morbid tone may not sit easily with some viewers interested in light entertainment, I can't help but feel the whole experience was very therapeutic and even comforting to its maker.  As he is quick to point out, William Shatner has been entertaining audiences for over 50 years.  ""When I die...if people say, 'He was Captain Kirk,"" I'm O.K. with that,"" Shatner tell Patrick Stewart.  And if the end is truly drawing near, this labor of love is a fine tribute to a group of people and a Canadian actor to whom they owe no small measure of their success.",4,"For better or worse, it's classic Shatner",1321920000,"11 22, 2011",2011,3244,"['not', 'denying', 'power', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Busier', 'ever', 'age', '80', 'former', 'Captain', 'James', 'T.', 'Kirk', 'periodically', 'philosopic', 'exploration', 'Star', 'Trek', 'phenomenon', 'Indeed', 'not', 'first', 'video', 'release', 'Shatner', 'deep', 'most', 'famous', 'character', 'see', 'alsoMind', 'Meld', 'Secrets', 'Voyage', 'Lifetime', 'Captains', 'along', '4', 'other', 'iconic', 'actors', 'franchise', 'candid', 'conversations.As', 'longtime', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fan', 'always', 'approach', 'interview', 'segments', 'actors', 'slight', 'amount', 'trepidation', 'fact', 'have', 'tendency', 'repeat', 'same', 'stories', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'sat', 'Nichelle', 'Nichols', 'old', 'chestnut', 'story', 'how', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr.', 'talked', 'not', 'leaving', 'original', 'series', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Happily', 'mostly', 'not', 'case', 'documentary', 'only', 'heard', 'one', 'story', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'used', 'two', 'years', 'previously', 'Captain', 'Summit', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'interviews', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'are', 'especially', 'enlightening', 'Mulgrew', 'far', 'more', 'pessimistic', 'always-affable', 'Enterprise', 'star', 'film', 'also', 'Shatner', 'face-to-face', 'NEW', 'Kirk', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'time', 'together', 'limited', 'credit', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'Pine', 'not', 'engaging', 'anything', 'resembling', 'hero-worship', 'Shatner', 'rare', 'restraint', 'keeping', 'own', 'ego', 'check.Ever', 'armchair', 'psychologist', 'Shatner', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'ask', 'big', 'questions', 'Bakula', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'strenuous', 'schedule', 'helped', 'end', 'marriage', 'almost-tearful', 'Stewart', 'always', 'placed', 'career', 'family', 'obligations', 'even', 'expense', 'two', 'wives', 'Mulgrew', 'pressures', 'being', 'single', 'mother', 'working', '12+', 'hour', 'days', 'set', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'then', 'Avery', 'Brooks', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'Capt', 'Sisko', 'What', 'make', 'extended', 'odes', 'rapturous', 'wonders', 'jazz', 'music', 'Brooks', 'even', 'non-answers', 'several', 'questions', 'tickling', 'ivories', 'show', 'franchise', 'dark', 'horse', 'Brooks', 'probably', 'Shatner', 'heir', 'apparent', 'virtue', 'bug-eyed', 'metaphysical', 'countenance', 'Seriously', 'nothing', 'inTrekkiesto', 'rival', 'unbridled', 'weirdness', 'Brooks', 'interview', 'segments', 'Captains', 'even', 'few', 'flaws', 'ultimately', 'true', 'time', 'capsule', 'anyone', 'future', 'who', 'might', 'wonder', 'just', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'Star', 'Trek', 'shows', 'movies', 'did', 'Mind', 'Meld', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Death', 'coming', 'sooner', 'rather', 'later', 'morbid', 'tone', 'may', 'not', 'sit', 'easily', 'viewers', 'interested', 'light', 'entertainment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'whole', 'experience', 'was', 'very', 'therapeutic', 'even', 'comforting', 'maker', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'William', 'Shatner', 'been', 'entertaining', 'audiences', '50', 'years', 'When', 'die', 'people', 'say', 'was', 'Captain', 'Kirk', ""'m"", 'O.K', 'Shatner', 'tell', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'end', 'truly', 'drawing', 'labor', 'love', 'fine', 'tribute', 'group', 'people', 'Canadian', 'actor', 'whom', 'owe', 'small', 'measure', 'success']","Captains, the - A Film by William Shatner"

1455433,AJYILFULOQ3CX,B005DEUEV8,a man from the east coast,"[3, 5]","First, let me say this:  If William Shatner had directed ""Star Trek V: The Final Frontier"" with the poignance and depth that he applied to ""The Captains"", I imagine that ""STV:TFF"" would be considered one of the better of the Star Trek movies, if not one of the best.This documentary, written and directed by Shatner, was considerably better than what I was expecting.  Although there are some scenes of Shatner doing some Star Trek stand-up at a convention (quite funny, by the way), and a few choice scenes from the various series and films, much of this documentary is Shatner interviewing those persons who enacted the roles that allowed Star Trek to move beyond Kirk's tenure in The Original Series.  Avery Brooks, Kate Mulgrew, Sir Patrick Stewart, and Scott Bakula represent the various series, and Chris Pine is also interviewed, chiming in with thoughts on what it's like to be Kirk.  Jonathan Frakes, who is now a Star Trek captain in his own right, having been given command of the ""Titan"" at the end of ""Star Trek: Nemesis"", is also on hand to put forth a few insightful comments.The interviews get into the personal trials and tribulations of what being a Star Trek captain meant to each of the actors mentioned above.  Shatner the interviewer is really quite blunt, and pushes his subjects with very direct questions, clearly seeking raw, uncensored answers.He asks Kate Mulgrew a few questions regarding being a woman in the Captain's chair that some might consider quite politically incorrect in nature; Mulgrew answers quite frankly, and in turn interviews Shatner about his own inner turmoils.  This is brilliant as the interviewer quickly becomes the interviewee, answering just as candidly as his subject, his heart just as much on his sleeve as hers.  Mulgrew clearly trusts Shatner, as he trusts her; there's obviously a mutual respect between these two.Sir Patrick Stewart speaks about his own personal life, and the effect his tenure in ""The Next Generation"" had upon his marriages; one can plainly see anguish on his face as he relates how his marriages ended.  Avery Brooks puts forth much insight on the decisions made in order to take upon the role of captain, and the impact those decisions had upon his family, and Scott Bakula offers the same.This documentary digs much more deeply into each actor's inner world and identity than what I was expecting; this was a most pleasant surprise.  Although quite serious at times, the tone of this film is not overly heavy-handed; director Shatner most skillfully varies the tone and pace of the film, allowing for various heart-to-hearts with each actor to therefore resonate more fully.I can't say enough how pleasantly surprised I was at the quality of this film.  Shatner's conversation with Stewart, towards the end of the film, regarding how each would feel if their roles in ""Star Trek"" were the only work for which either of them were ever remembered, is a particularly poignant moment in a film replete with the same.  Although this entire documentary is, indirectly at least, a homage to the cultural impact of Star Trek, this particular conversation carries much weight; one can see that these two men are contemplating their lives' work, and finding that it is indeed worthy of great respect.  This reveals to us the unifying point of ""The Captains""; this film is very much fraught with the respect Shatner has come to have for Star Trek, and yet, most refreshingly, this respect is presented as an undertone of the film, perhaps not exactly subtle, but not demanding incessant attention either.Clearly, Shatner has finally, after a few twists and turns along the way, come to truly love Star Trek.  Rather than telling the Trekers to ""Get a life!"" and ""Move out of your parent's basements!"", this film is Shatner's own celebration of his role in Star Trek, as well as his invitation to Trekers everywhere to deepen their understanding of what went into creating these various Star Trek series, at least from the point of view as seen from the captain's chair.  There's nary a dull moment to be had in these very moving interviews; even the most knowledgeable Trekker will come away feeling like he's discovered something new.Shatner is a talented man, and his abilities as a director have developed such that he's now quite capable of putting forth a first-rate documentary.  I'd have given this film five stars, but regarding such lofty ratings, I apply them only to films like ""Casablanca"", ""Judgment at Nuremburg"" (look for a very youthful Shatner playing Spencer Tracy's assistant), and a very few other classics.  My point?  Well, whilst this might not be a classic in the most conventional sense of the films just mentioned, it's sure to be a classic for Trekers, and perhaps also for those seeking to better understand this historically significant phenomena that has become a cultural landmark.I recommend ""The Captains"" most wholeheartedly.  Please enjoy this very wonderful film.",4,4 and 1/2 stars; Quite a good documentary,1338940800,"06 6, 2012",2012,4972,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'William', 'Shatner', 'had', 'directed', 'Star', 'Trek',

Kate Mulgrew just seems tragic and self-consumed, and Avery Brooks has either gone insane or is high as a kite.  I can't believe there are people praising this exercise in weirdness.  Shatner's ego is as expansive as his waistline, and his views on women are so offensive and archaic that I can't watch the old Star Treks without thinking what an a-hole he is.  He actually tells Mulgrew that in real life women can't be leaders because they have too many hormones!

This is an immature and shallow man who's learned very little real truth in his life; his ""philosophical"" quest concerning life and death is simply an effort to make himself feel important.  This documentary just about wrecked Star Trek for me.  I have a new term: ""Shatnered.""  It's when something you like gets so undermined that the experience is ruined.  The somewhat idyllic Star Trek universe, with its ideals of equality, purpose and humanity, have been shattered (Shatnered).",2,Who in the world would give this five stars?,1380153600,"09 26, 2013",2013,1453,"[""'d"", 'only', 'recommend', 'oddity', 'bizarre', 'look', 'William', 'Shatner', 'strange', 'perspective', 'life', 'equally', 'disturbing', 'former', 'captains', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', 'just', 'tragic', 'self-consumed', 'Avery', 'Brooks', 'gone', 'insane', 'high', 'kite', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'are', 'people', 'praising', 'exercise', 'weirdness', 'Shatner', 'ego', 'as', 'expansive', 'waistline', 'views', 'women', 'are', 'so', 'offensive', 'archaic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'old', 'Star', 'Treks', 'thinking', 'what', 'a-hole', 'actually', 'Mulgrew', 'real', 'life', 'women', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'leaders', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'hormones', ""'m"", 'man', 'man', 'can', 'say', 'have', 'as', 'many', 'not', 'more', 'hormones', 'raging', 'bodies', 'women', 'How', 'many', 'female', 'senators', 'have', 'been', 'caught', 'soliciting', 'sex', 'public', 'bathrooms', 'hiring', 'prostitutes', 'Shatner', 'ridiculous', 'reviewers', 'trying', 'attach', 'depth', 'meaning', 'documentary', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'immature', 'shallow', 'man', 'who', 'learned', 'very', 'little', 'real', 'truth', 'life', 'philosophical', 'quest', 'concerning', 'life', 'death', 'simply', 'effort', 'make', 'feel', 'important', 'documentary', 'just', 'wrecked', 'Star', 'Trek', 'have', 'new', 'term', 'Shatnered', 'when', 'something', 'so', 'undermined', 'experience', 'ruined', 'somewhat', 'idyllic', 'Star', 'Trek', 'universe', 'ideals', 'equality', 'purpose', 'humanity', 'have', 'been', 'shattered', 'Shatnered']","Captains, the - A Film by William Shatner"

1455443,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B005DEUEV8,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 2]","THE CAPTAINS (writ., prod., dir., host., narr. William Shatner, 2011, 97 minutes, Film Canada, for the Epix Channel) is one of the best and most profound documentaries I have ever seen. It goes beyond being an original 1st-generation Trekkie. It goes beyond the love for Captain Kirk. It delves into places where no one has gone before ~ and I loved every single second.First off, allow me to be rightly understood. My wife and I are original Trekkies, so there was no such word when we were enjoying every minute of ""Star Trek"" on TV. This documentary is exactly what it advertizes: interviews with actors who have played captains of the Enterprise, plus an interview with Christopher Plummer who never played a captain of Starfleet. This IS about the ACTORS, including Shatner, not about ""Star Trek"" itself or any other thing. Actors are full of hot air: it's what they do for a living.Shatner begins this documentary with a suddenness that is most fitting: he is off to chat with all the main actors who have played captains (all captains of the Enterprise with the exception of Avery Brooks, who was captain in ""Deep Space Nine"", and Christopher Plummer who was a Klingon general).To England for Sir Patrick Stewart. To God knows where to listen to Avery Brooks groove on the piano. To a steaming hot New York City for Kate Mulgrew. Shatner visits Scott Bakula at some interesting California horse ranch. Right outside the gate at Paramount for Chris Pine (who was undoubtedly shooting the next STAR TREK which will be entered into our archives as STAR TREK 12 though it is titled STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS).The entire film reminded me of Shatner's amazing stamina and youthful energy.Intercut here are tiny bits of Shatner's beginnings at Stratford, Ontario; these alternate with Shatner's latest appearance at a Star Trek convention in Las Vegas (where he appeared with Stewart). But the interviews are splendid, deep and revelatory. I have never learned so much about actors or acting as I did during this 97 golden minutes. Shatner has a way of bringing things out of people, and boy, does he do it here.He interviews fellow Stratforder Christopher Plummer, known for playing Klingon General Chang inStar Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country~ Plummer and Shatner are old, old friends who went back together almost to childhood.Naturally, Chris Pine as the baby of the bunch got little screen time here (but Shatner says to him earnestly, ""You're me fifty years ago!""). Scott Bakula, a perennial favorite of mine and my wife's gets almost as little screen time but all that is fine. Shatner draws out what he wants from them, and one feels satisfied.There is much humor and the best quality of pathos which as far as I am concerned is 100% unscripted (because there are obviously scripted moments and one or two gags). However, the best is in each actor coming together with Shatner, seemingly for the first time ever, as former captains of the Enterprise.They talk turkey about the brutal hours filming, the loss of family (Shatner and Bakula shared that in common) and breakups of marriages. They examine what Star Trek has done for each of them as actors and as people, not least of all Shatner. I was startled by his confession to Patrick Stewart that he had finally come to grips with his pride at playing Captain Kirk. He claims he had lived with something akin to shame over the whole thing.An example of the pure joy of learning is Kate Mulgrew explaining her initial appearance onStar Trek Voyager: The Complete Seriesas captain of the Voyager. Many of us know Genevieve Bujold was hired and filmed for exactly one day ~ a breakdown of some kind which she suffered chased her off the set, and Mulgrew was immediately called in to replace Bujold. Mulgrew says little about that, merely referring to it as a sort of disaster that resulted in her participation as Captain Janeway.Here, I got the honor of seeing Shatner, and all the other captains plus Plummer, in all their glory as people. Simple, ordinary people as I have always said actors are, riffing on acting and life. You cannot be a Trek fan without this. You cannot profess a love of cinema or the craft without this. It is an Oscar-worthy documentary film because it is an important historical document.I can't imagine a Star Trek fan who would willingly miss seeing this film ~ or bitch about it.MINOR UPDATE: Though it is my habit to try and ignore comments, there is one posted beneath this review and it made me think a bit. Let me humbly ask readers: if you hate Star Trek, what are you doing even reading reviews for this or any Star Trek-related film? If you hate Shatner, well, there's a long line stretching decades before you ever came along. PLEASE don't take it out on me or my review. The internet is full of hateful people: let's start changing that!",5,"""This is fifty-some years later, and I'm an old man."" -William Shatner",1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,4835,"['CAPTAINS',

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 0]","It's charming - as fans of William Shatner will assure you: `Shatner's a charming guy!' - and that's the best that can be said for THE CAPTAINS.  It's a leisurely visit - a warm & welcome chat between the fictional captains who've populated the Trek universe.  Sure, maybe there's nothing all that revelatory here, but does there have to be?  Instead of yet another dry, stuffing, and dated documentary examining Trek from its position on the pop culture ladder, Shatner's documentary maintains a relaxed pace strolling through the more personal history of the Star Trek captains.Shatner conducts interview with Patrick Stewart, Avery Brooks, Kate Mulgrew, Scott Bakula, and even Chris Pine, who took over the center seat as a younger incarnation of the legendary Captain James T. Kirk in Paramount Pictures 2009 STAR TREK relaunch that enjoyed solid box office performance.  That I'm aware of, this was the first opportunity for Pine and Shatner to go on the record jointly, and, while there are no `shocking' revelations, it's still a pleasant visit between two talented men.As for the other interviews?  Everyone's very cordial, and that's no doubt the fact that they've probably met before at any number of the officially-sponsored conventions that occur regularly each year around the world.  STAR TREK is a cultural phenomenon, and it's very clear that each of these actors holds the franchise in great respect.  Here, they get to sound off about how they felt about the responsibility, how they deal with fandom, and even sound off a bit on ways they first got involved in the craft of acting and what their various influences in life have been.  While each of them may have some personal reservations about what effect serving Starfleet had had on their careers, they still embrace the reality of their situation with obvious love and charm.Though I've no problem saying it: Avery Brooks (DS9's Captain Benjamin Sisko) came off looking a little bit of a cuckoo!  I remember reading that, last February (2012), Mr. Brooks was pulled over driving while intoxicated, and I have to wonder if that incident wasn't some time about the time he sat down for his visit with Shatner.  Watch the disc, and I think you'll quite possibly agree!The disc comes with one bonus feature (""The Making of The Captains"").  Sound and picture are acceptable quality, and, clearly, a good time was had by all!STRONGLY RECOMMENDED for fans of the Star Trek franchise; mildly RECOMMENDED for everyone elseIn the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to share that the folks at E-One (Entertainment One) provided me with a DVD screener copy for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",4,Shatner's THE CAPTAINS Boldly Looks Back Where STAR TREK Has Gone Before,1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,2672,"['charming', 'fans', 'William', 'Shatner', 'will', 'assure', 'Shatner', 'charming', 'guy', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'THE', 'CAPTAINS', 'leisurely', 'visit', 'warm', 'welcome', 'chat', 'fictional', 'captains', 'who', ""'ve"", 'populated', 'Trek', 'universe', 'Sure', 'maybe', 'nothing', 'revelatory', 'here', 'there', 'have', 'be', 'Instead', 'yet', 'dry', 'stuffing', 'dated', 'documentary', 'examining', 'Trek', 'position', 'pop', 'culture', 'ladder', 'Shatner', 'documentary', 'relaxed', 'pace', 'strolling', 'more', 'personal', 'history', 'Star', 'Trek', 'captains.Shatner', 'interview', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Avery', 'Brooks', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'even', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'who', 'took', 'over', 'center', 'seat', 'younger', 'incarnation', 'legendary', 'Captain', 'James', 'T.', 'Kirk', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', '2009', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'relaunch', 'enjoyed', 'solid', 'box', 'office', 'performance', ""'m"", 'aware', 'was', 'first', 'opportunity', 'Pine', 'Shatner', 'go', 'record', 'jointly', 'are', 'shocking', 'revelations', 'still', 'pleasant', 'visit', 'two', 'talented', 'men.As', 'other', 'interviews', 'Everyone', 'very', 'cordial', 'doubt', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'met', 'before', 'number', 'officially-sponsored', 'conventions', 'occur', 'regularly', 'year', 'world', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'cultural', 'phenomenon', 'very', 'clear', 'actors', 'franchise', 'great', 'respect', 'Here', 'get', 'sound', 'off', 'how', 'felt', 'responsibility', 'how', 'deal', 'fandom', 'even', 'sound', 'off', 'bit', 'ways', 'first', 'got', 'involved', 'craft', 'acting', 'what', 'various', 'influences', 'life', 'have', 'been', 'may', 'have', 'personal', 'reservations', 'what', 'effect', 'serving', 'Starfleet', 'had', 'had', 'careers', 'still', 'embrace', 'reality', 'situation', 'obvious', 'love', 'charm.Though', ""'ve"", 'problem', 'saying', 'Avery', 'Brooks', 'DS9', 'Captain', 'Benjamin', 'Sisko', 'came', 'off', 'looking', 'little', 'bit', 'cuckoo', 'remember', 'reading', 'last', 'February', '2012', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'was', 'pulled', 'over', 'driving', 'intoxicated', 'have', 'wonder', 'incident', 'was', ""n't"", 'time', 'time', 'sat', 'down', 'visit', 'Shatner', 'Watch', 'disc', 'think', ""'ll"", 'quite', 'possibly', 'agree', 'disc', 'one', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Making', 'Captains', 'Sound', 'picture', 'are', 'acceptable', 'quality', 'clearly', 'good', 'time', 'was', 'had', 'STRONGLY', 'RECOMMENDED', 'fans', 'Star', 'Trek', 'franchise', 'mildly', 'RECOMMENDED', 'everyone', 'interests', 'fairness', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'share', 'folks', 'E-One', 'Entertainment', 'One', 'provided', 'DVD', 'screener', 'copy', 'expressed', 'purposes', 'completing', 'review']","Captains, the - A Film by William Shatner"

It is a journey of personal self discovery for himself.  He is originally from Canada and the CEO of Bombardier airplanes gives Shater a plane to use as the CEO was influenced by Shatner's Captain Kirk to get into the airplane industry.Shatner flies to England to interview Sir Paterick Stewert, while flying there he reads over Stewert's bio and learns some things about Stewert.  When he gets to England he talks to Stewert about what he has learned. Shatner is a bit of a blustery interviewer, sometimes cutting the people off to talk about himself.He talks to Avery Brooks as Brooks continues to play music.  Each captain has a brief clip of their work shown, perhaps ther could have been more of that.He talks to Kate Mulgrew about the difficulty of being a parent and working so hard on the series.  There is mention that filming the show caused divorce and not good parenting, sad.He talks to Scott Bakula about Bakula's singing and they do some horseback riding.He arm wrestles Chris Pine. Through out all this it is somewhat of a journey for Shatner, he explains that he did not get much recognition during the original show's 3-year run and he was somewhat ashamed of the character as when people see him they call ""Beam me up, Scotty."" He shares about his acting in NYC and in Canada.He attends a Star Trek convention and is treated like royalty, he does some stand-up and talks with a fan in a wheel chair, it appears to make the fan's day.Some lesser known characters talk and Christopher Plummer discusses his input into a movie.

1455450,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B005DEUEV8,Enjolras,"[1, 2]","The Captains is a surprisingly intimate portrait of the actors who play the captains in Star Trek. Unlike other documentaries, this isn't about the making of Star Trek, but rather about the actors themselves and what they went through to make the shows. I'm sure some of the drama was staged or preplanned, but much of it feels so real. At times, the actors really bare themselves discussing death, divorce, and how Star Trek took over their lives.The camera follows Shatner as he interviews all of the other Star Trek captains. I thought the conversations with Patrick Stewart were the most profound. You really do get the sense that the actors come to an understanding of their legacies. Shatner's time with Avery Brooks was a bit disappoint - mostly spent performing beat poetry and listing to Brooks' meanderings. It's a bit of a shame because Sisko was my favorite captain. Shatner's interviews with Kate Mulgrew were at times almost confrontational, but this actually really brought out some personal moments from deep in her soul. Mulgrew talked with real regret about her struggles while on the show, and for the first time I actually felt bad for a famous actor and realized that she really did sacrifice a lot. There seemed to be a nice chemistry between Shatner and Jonathan Archer, and the discussion veered between Archer's respect for the original Star Trek and mutual reminiscences about divorce and life. Chris Pine makes a brief appearance, which was nice, but underutilized.The scenes at the Star Trek conventions threaten to take away from the intimacy of the conversations, but they do give us a chance to see the stark contrast between Shatner's internal struggles and how he's managed to become a convention favorite. Shatner is graceful with fans and while I would have preferred more of the captains it turns out to be a nice change of pace.Overall, this is a unique documentary and a must for Star Trek fans. I can't imagine anybody but Shatner getting these actors to open up so candidly on camera. It's far beyond anything you'll find on DVD extras.

1455455,A2OM1KMB1OHK,B005DEUEV8,Gerald Heffner,"[4, 5]","First and foremost: if you're not a Star Trek fan and you're watching this documentary you'll most likely be baffled, confused, and possibly shocked at times by the tremendous egos in play here. This isn't so much a deep examination of the actors who portrayed the captains in each Star Trek series as it is a collection of anecdotes and reflections by those actors about their time spent working on their respective shows, what they took away from the experience, and a brief overview of their motivations to enter the acting profession and their subsequent careers.This is primarily a personality piece and it's a vanity project in the most vain sense of the word. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate William Shatner. It's kind of impossible to. Part of his charm is the fact that he's so full of himself. It's to the point in his old age (82 if you can believe it) that he's become a parody of himself, but such to the point that he *understands* that he's a parody of himself, which only somehow manages to fuel his ego more and make him even *more* full of himself than he was to begin with. It's a self-perpetuating cycle, but one that manages to make him endearing instead of irritating. It's evident in his opening monologue when he lays out his plan to meet with each actor on a globe-trotting adventure and maybe learn something about himself along the way... Mmm-hmm...The film follows Shatner as he meets with each actor who portrayed the lead role, the captain, in each Star Trek series. Sir Patrick Stewart gets the most face-time with Shatner and reveals some striking things about his approach to acting with respect to his other priorities in life, his regrets, and the sacrifices he's made to his art. Indeed it is Stewart's dedication and professionalism that he brought to the role of Picard that leads Shatner to re-evaluate his feelings of ""embarrassment"" at having played Kirk, seeing him as something of a ""lesser"" role after working with the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in his youth. Shatner's on-screen epiphany that Kirk is something to be proud of is doubtless supposed to be the personal revelation promised in the opening monologue, but it feels like ego-engineered pathos and it's one of the more uncomfortable aspects of the film. I'm sure it's tough for an actor to be so well-known for only one role, but judging by how often Shatner returns to Kirk and Star Trek in his later years (including his whole line of alternate-timeline ""Shatnerverse"" Star Trek novels which features a resurrected Captain Kirk adventuring alongside Captains Picard, Sisko and Janeway) it's hard to empathize with what seems like a manufactured plot device. And isn't this supposed to be a documentary?In his interview with Kate Mulgrew, Shatner gets to touch on sacrifice again when she reminisces about her Voyager tenure as a single mother of two working impossible hours and not being able to be the mother she could have been. She also engages Shatner, in contrast to the schlocky shame/pride paraodx above, with a rather telling question of mortality. Turns out that Shatner is afraid of death and that he engages in work like making this film to help him feel more alive. This carries over into his discussions with Scott Bakula with whom he trades witticisms about, variously, the human soul, horses, and Broadway musicals. Out of all the captains, Bakula seems to be the most level-headed and down to earth. There are big egos and big personalities on display here and Scott just has that average Joe charm about him. Finally there is Chris Pine who is currently portraying Captain Kirk in the J.J. Abrams reboot of Star Trek. Oddly enough, he gets probably the smallest amount of time allotted despite playing a new version of Shatner's iconic character. There is some compare/contrast that occurs, but it seems like given the scope of what could have been discussed, Chris Pine gets a bit of a raw deal here.I skipped over Avery Brooks for a reason. That reason is because Avery Books is crazy. His approach to answering William Shatner's interview-style questions is either to A) wax philosophical invoking some sort of quasi-beatnik urban spiritualism or, more often, B) grin steadily while playing some smooth jazz piano and riffing improvised lyrics with Shatner. It's one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen, but it's strangely harmonious. Brooks and Shatner are somehow, impossibly, on the same wavelength in these moments. I've only watched this on my Prime account, but I can only hope that on the DVD there might be extended footage from this ""interview"" because it's probably the best part of the film for sheer entertainment value; Avery is one cool cat.The film feels a bit unfocused at times, but for the most part each captain gets their fair share. Aside from the interviews with the captains, some other Trek alumni make brief appearances including Jonathan Frakes, Robert Picardo, Rene Auberjonois, and others. Of special note is Christopher Plummer, a friend from early in Shatner's career who gets a decent Q&A.; We also get some archival footage of the various incarnations of Trek and few snippets of a Star Trek convention where Shatner prowls around photobombing unsuspecting fans and calling every female cast member he meets ""the most beautiful woman ever to appear in Star Trek."" In some moments he seems to be offering casual disdain for the whole thing while in others he's gleefully feeding the frenzy as much for his own fulfillment as anyone else's. In the end this is a move that William Shatner made about himself and he brought the other captains along for a ride. It's not the deepest or even most honest documentary you're going to find about this franchise, but it's definitely a decent snapshot of its biggest personality. That, in and of itself, is something to see.Final thoughts: Probably doesn't offer up anything hardcore Trekkies don't already know, but it's a nice supplement for the rest of us, especially those of us who want to know what goes on inside William Shatner's head these days.",3,Ego Stroking At Its Finest,1372464000,"06 29, 2013",2013,6063,"['First', 'foremost', ""'re"", 'not', 'Star', 'Trek',

Kline ""art & technology""","[97, 109]","[I watched this on EpixHD and will certainly buy it once available on DVD]Shatner is a living spectacle of his own accord.  He is controversy and entertainment wrapped into one.  And unfortunately, his package deal sometimes comes off a bit pompous and egotistical.  Few people really like someone who may revel in the enjoyment of his own voice.  Shatner at times does this, and yet... if you can get past that veneer, underneath you will find a very fascinating and earnest man.  He is someone who lucked into a legendary role that has made him supremely famous, something that for a long period he derided, yet eventually relented and embraced.  He is flawed, he knows he is flawed, but he admits it openly with sincerity.  I admire him now, more than I ever did.""You either love him or you hate him,"" is how I've often heard Shatner described.  And in various on-line forums that I've had the pleasure to read, you'll see a wide range of polarized opinions about him.  Love him or hate him, he played a very important part in the world of Star Trek.  He is essential.NOTE: There's a review of this movie up on the New York Times website, worth a read.  The author hit the nail on the head saying that Shatner's ""genial, relaxed self-absorption is a large part of his charm.""So, ""The Captains""... Shatner is typical Shatner in some respects, and yet he is also so much better than that.  He usually behaves as alpha male, and yet he is ingratiating with his guests.  He loves to talk about himself, and yet he is also genuinely interested in others.  Making this film was a very humbling experience for Shatner and you can see it in the content.  There are a few rather blatant ego stroking moments that were no doubt purposefully left in after editing, as Shatner not only wrote but directed this production.It's true that not all of these interviews are created equal.  Some of them are all too brief and miss some important aspects.  Some questions are raised in common across the guests and yet not all of them are fully heard.  But you know, this couldn't have been a perfect work.  It required a certain amount of liberty from the guests, who were allowed to influence the flow.  Of all the interviews, I found the one with Patrick Stewart the most touching.  The one with Avery Brooks the most endearing.  The one with Kate Mulgrew wonderfully surprising.  And the one with Scott Bakula delightfully honest.  There wasn't much to do with Chris Pine, because he's so young and doesn't have nearly enough experience to contribute on the same level.  But what we got was reasonably good.The whole package deal is simply wonderful.  We get what appears to be very candid and revealing interviews with key actors from the Star Trek genre, hosted by a deeply colorful man.

1455459,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005DEUEV8,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 7]","You may call it a vanity project, a self-promotional piece, but THE CAPTAINS still offers up savory stuff for them STAR TREK fans. Whether you're a Trekker or a Trekkie or even just a casual fan, THE CAPTAINS is must-see viewing. But, yes, writer, director, and interviewer William Shatner does have a way of deflecting the conversation back to himself. It's probably some kind of superpower.What Shatner did was call up all the actors who'd ever anchored a STAR TREK television series as a Starfleet captain - or, in Chris Pine's case, a feature film - and rallied them into being interview fodder for this documentary. So, c'mon, all the Trek captains being interviewed by THE captain himself? As a selling point, this doesn't come more huge. I found this documentary to be absorbing and at times funny and, at one point, baffling (*coughAveryBrookscough*).Shatner should be creepy instead of uber-popular, but he's got a way of spinning things so that you end up liking him more. He's so genial in his self-promotion. He has this ability to toe the line between sincerity and pomposity. If you were wondering when the huckster in Shatner comes out, it doesn't take long. Within the first few minutes of the documentary he's preening in self-satisfaction as the executive of the aerospace company of the plane flying him to England (for the Patrick Stewart bit) informs him that, as a kid, he was inspired by Captain Kirk. Crows Shatner: ""He became an aeronautical engineer because of me!""Some of the chit chat weigh more than others. Shatner and Chris Pine engaged in a wrestling match is fun to eyeball, but the meatiest moments are with the others who'd been behind the helm the longest. Obvious themes are addressed: STAR TREK's impact and enduring popularity, the toll the show took on the actors' personal lives, the resulting rocky marriages and relationships with their children. Avery Brooks, Kate Mulgrew, Scott Bakula, and Sir Patrick Stewart all succumb to a bit of soul searching and reminiscing.Shatner unveils a different approach with each Captain. Naturally he was more flirty with Kate Mulgrew. He plays the ""us regular guys"" card with Pine and Bakula, and so effortlessly bonds with them. Bakula and Pine come across as very down-to-earth persons. Avery Brooks is one enigmatic and out there cat who spends much of the interview behind the piano, sometimes jazz riffing, mostly waxing existential. Every now and then Shatner would play along and improv a jazz song with him. You may laugh or roll your eyes at Shatner's efforts, but there's no doubting he was sincerely trying to sync with Brooks. But it was sometimes awkward.The most emotional moments surface when Shatner sits with Patrick Stewart. The session with Sir Patrick would yield some truly poignant reveals from both gentlemen. As usual, Shatner turns the conversation back to himself as he expresses in length how he now feels about being perceived as Captain Kirk in this late stage of his career. For the most part, Stewart indulges him, although there seems to be this bemused, ""deer in the headlights"" expression on his face.Shatner isn't hard to find. He saunters thru Star Trek conventions like the god he is, and the fans give him his just propers. There's a sequence here in which he approaches respective booths featuring Jeri Ryan, Sally Kellerman, and Grace Lee Whitney, three actresses who at one time or another had spent time on the franchise. Each time Shatner mugs for the camera and tells the world that each actress is the most beautiful girl in the history of STAR TREK. The thing is, I almost believe he means it each time.The DVD's bonus stuff: The Making Of THE CAPTAINS featurette (00:11:00 minutes long) and the trailer for THE CAPTAINS.",4,"""I realized that I'm slightly embarrassed by Star Trek.""",1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,3747,"['may', 'call', 'vanity', 'project', 'self-promotional', 'piece', 'THE', 'CAPTAINS', 'still', 'up', 'savory', 'stuff', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'fans', ""'re"", 'Trekker', 'Trekkie', 'even', 'just', 'casual', 'fan', 'CAPTAINS', 'must-see', 'viewing', 'yes', 'writer', 'director', 'interviewer', 'William', 'Shatner', 'have', 'way', 'deflecting', 'conversation', 'back', 'probably', 'kind', 'superpower.What', 'Shatner', 'did', 'was', 'call', 'up', 'actors', 'who', ""'d"", 'ever', 'anchored', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'television', 'series', 'Starfleet', 'captain', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'case', 'feature', 'film', 'rallied', 'being', 'interview', 'fodder', 'documentary', 'So', ""c'mon"", 'Trek', 'captains', 'being', 'interviewed', 'THE', 'captain', 'selling', 'point', ""n't"", 'come', 'more', 'huge', 'found', 'documentary', 'be', 'absorbing', 'times', 'funny', 'one', 'point', 'baffling', '*coughAveryBrookscough*', '.Shatner', 'should', 'be', 'creepy', 'instead', 'uber-popular', 'got', 'way', 'spinning', 'things', 'so', 'end', 'up', 'liking', 'more', 'so', 'genial', 'self-promotion', 'ability', 'toe', 'line', 'sincerity', 'pomposity', 'were', 'wondering', 'when', 'huckster', 'Shatner', 'out', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'documentary', 'preening', 'self-satisfaction', 'executive', 'aerospace', 'company', 'plane', 'flying', 'England', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'bit', 'that', 'kid', 'was', 'inspired', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'Crows', 'Shatner', 'became', 'aeronautical', 'engineer', 'chit', 'chat', 'more', 'others', 'Shatner', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'engaged', 'wrestling', 'match', 'fun', 'eyeball', 'meatiest', 'moments', 'are', 'others', 'who', ""'d"", 'been', 'helm', 'longest', 'Obvious', 'themes', 'are', 'addressed', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'impact', 'enduring', 'popularity', 'toll', 'show', 'took', 'actors', 'personal', 'lives', 'resulting', 'rocky', 'marriages', 'relationships', 'children', 'Avery', 'Brooks', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'Sir', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'succumb', 'bit', 'soul', 'searching', 'reminiscing.Shatner', 'unveils', 'different', 'approach', 'Captain', 'Naturally', 'was', 'more', 'flirty', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', 'regular', 'guys', 'card', 'Pine', 'Bakula', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'bonds', 'Bakula', 'Pine', 'come', 'very', 'down-to-earth', 'persons', 'Avery', 'Brooks', 'one', 'enigmatic', 'there', 'cat', 'who', 'spends', 'much', 'interview', 'piano', 'sometimes', 'jazz', 'riffing', 'mostly', 'waxing', 'existential', 'now', 'then', 'Shatner', 'would', 'play', 'along', 'improv', 'jazz', 'song', 'may', 'laugh', 'roll', 'eyes', 'Shatner', 'efforts', 'doubting', 'was', 'sincerely', 'trying', 'sync', 'Brooks', 'was', 'sometimes', 'awkward.The', 'most', 'emotional', 'moments', 'surface', 'when', 'Shatner', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'session', 'Sir', 'Patrick', 'would', 'yield', 'truly', 'poignant', 'reveals', 'gentlemen', 'usual', 'Shatner', 'conversation', 'back', 'length', 'how', 'now', 'being', 'perceived', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'late', 'stage', 'career', 'most', 'part', 'Stewart', 'there', 'be', 'bemused', 'deer', 'headlights', 'expression', 'face.Shatner', ""n't"", 'hard', 'find', 'thru', 'Star', 'Trek', 'conventions', 'god', 'fans', 'give', 'just', 'propers', 'sequence', 'here', 'respective', 'booths', 'featuring', 'Jeri', 'Ryan', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'Grace', 'Lee', 'Whitney', 'three', 'actresses', 'who', 'one', 'time', 'had', 'spent', 'time', 'franchise', 'time', 'Shatner', 'mugs', 'camera', 'world', 'actress', 'most', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'history', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'thing', 'almost', 'believe', 'time.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'Making', 'THE', 'CAPTAINS', 'featurette', '00:11:00', 'minutes', 'long', 'trailer', 'CAPTAINS']","Captains, the - A Film by William Shatner"

1455468,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005DEUEV8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[22, 27]","I've got to give credit where credit is due!  Actor William Shatner came up with an inspired idea in the documentary ""The Captains"" which adds a missing piece to the legacy of television's longest running space saga.  Uniting the six actors that have been featured as Captains in the show's various interpretations, the movie would seem to have all of the elements necessary to make it essential viewing for Star Trek fans.  I'm not sure, however, that Shatner (taking a writing and directing credit) hits his mark squarely.  Expecting new insight into the franchise with marketing that promises an ""exclusive behind-the-scenes look at a pop culture phenomenon,"" I actually thought the film had surprisingly little to say about Star Trek itself.  If anything, the documentary's primary subject is acting as a craft and as a career with many of the face-to-face conversations seeming like a low-rent ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" but without the flair.  Don't get me wrong--I would still recommend this to fans, it just fails to fulfill some of its promise.At the heart of the film is Shatner himself.  He is, at once, the film's most valuable asset and one of its primary weaknesses.  He travels the globe (as far as England anyway) to sit down with Patrick Stewart, Avery Brooks, Kate Mulgrew, Scott Bakula, and Chris Pine.  Shatner, as a persona, is as lively as ever.  As an interviewer, however, he lacks a bit of focus constantly bringing any conversation back to what seems to be his favorite topic--himself.  It is sometimes awkward, sometimes endearing.  At the beginning of each interview, he seems to want to introduce some deep philosophical concept to make the casual get-togethers seem as if they are fraught with meaning.  One of my favorite moments is when he is absolutely incredulous when Stewart says he was in an adult theater piece at the age of 12 (with bulging enthusiasm, ""How did you get into a play with adults?"" as if it were a strange concept for a budding thespian).  Other odd moments include him singing along to Brooks' piano playing and the strangely sexist bend his interview with Mulgrew hits.Through it all, though, Shatner is an enthusiastic guide.  The interviews lack some insight, as I've mentioned.  He is, after all, only sitting down with the individual participants for a couple of hours each.  The footage from the Star Trek convention is fun enough and he tries to pepper the interviews with humor (arm wrestling, cardboard boxes).  It's all light and pleasant enough without being particularly revelatory.  Bonus points for adding Christopher Plummer to the roster (Why? Because he could).  An entertaining film that misses out on its enormous potential, I'd still give it a look if it sounds at all interesting.  Shatner so wanted to make a meaningful piece, but it really lacks any depth in actual relationship to the Star Trek franchise.  And it certainly seems disingenuous when Shatner claims to have finally made peace with being James T. Kirk on the flight over to interview Stewart.  Convenient timing!  You truly have to be a Shatner fan to appreciate most of the movie--and if you are, enjoy!  About 3 1/2 stars.

And we are left with a show basically about him and his antics and how his role in star trek changed the world.And, as a woman, I was particularly irritated with his treatment of Janeway.

I was frustrated most other reviewers had no comment on the matter. Shatner basically forces Janeway into agreeing (and by some of her responses I'm not sure she even was agreeing but the scenes seemed to be cut together to look like she was) that women can't be effective leaders because of their raging hormones both when young and when menopausal. Really? Come one? I understand he did this whole thing himself, but show a little bit of manners, just a little. She was having to deal with being a SINGLE parent while filming Voyager, and the hardships of that don't have much to do with being female. That's a whole nother level of tough no matter who you are.And then, he shows himself walking around the convention homing in on every pretty young girl in skimpy clothes, and telling every female star trek actress that they are the most beautiful woman in star trek, (although Janeway doesn't warrant such praise apparently) and getting his kisses.

1455475,A37QUQPYFMR9Y9,B005DEUEV8,"M.D.C. ""Tempting Reviews""","[5, 8]","And that's only because for some peculiar reason - time, likely - Chris Pine got all of maybe 15 minutes of the screen.  Avery Brooks got a lot, and the majority of that was him singing and playing the piano, rather than the soul search we were promised.  The only one who was worth the time was Sir Patrick Stewart, who told truly heartfelt tales that are sure to give you deeper insight into possibly the most memorable captain aside from Kirk himself.  I especially was moved when he said that he was comfortable in his own company, that he'd made mistakes that led him to two divorces.  You see them on the screen and you assume that they must be living the life - indeed, Stewart's estate is an amazing one - but they're just mortal like you and me, and the concept of this video...deeper knowledge into the people that touched our hearts...was a great one.There are also some guest appearances by some of the secondary talent - Robert Picardo (The Doctor on Voyager), Jonathan Frakes (Will Riker on TNG), and Dominic Keating (Malcom Reed from Enterprise) most notably, who give their commentary on what it was like to work with each captain.The breakdown:Sir Patrick Stewart: Shatner meets up with Stewart at his England estate.  Their discussion centers mostly around Stewart's extensive acting history, as well as what got him into it.  They also go very deep with ""what if"" discussions of the future and how they both felt about doing Star Trek when they saw the scripts.Avery Brooks: Shatner meets Brooks at his home in New Jersey, where he learns more about Brooks' musical background and interests.  Brooks' part of the movie is really him communicating in song - whether you prefer that or not.  You don't really learn about him like you'd expect to.  It's difficult to follow him and Shatner.Kate Mulgrew: Shatner meets Mulgrew in New York (I think), and they talk in a Broadway forum.  Mulgrew's is likely the most uncomfortable, because the tension between the two begins to rise during their chat about her challenges being the first female captain in a mostly male-dominated environment.  Both make equally good points, but you can cut the tension with a knife at times.Scott Bakula: Shatner meets Bakula at his ranch in Canada (I think), and they talk about Bakula's attempt to recreate some of the chemistry found with Kirk, Spock and Bones...ultimately failing (his words which I agree with), but being proud to have been ""the first captain"".Chris Pine: Shatner meets Pine at, of all places, a metal table out in front of Paramount, in Los Angeles.  This one is the most bizarre.  They arm wrestle.  No, I'm serious.  Pine doesn't get much time at all out of all of the captains, and there certainly is no soul searching.  It's mostly talk about Pine's family being actors.The movie is well worth the purchase and a worthy addition to any collection.  My main complaint was Pine.  He was the one I wanted to know more about since he was basically thrust into the role of a young Captain Kirk - large shoes to fill.  Also, there were no commentary pieces from the likes of Zoe Saldana (Uhura), Zachary Quinto (Spock) or even the venerable Karl Urban (McCoy) from Enterprise.  It was like an afterthought, or a brief spot where they felt compelled to fit them in somewhere.  But I did enjoy learning more about Stewart, as in a lot of ways I modeled my personality around his, and I did take inspiration seeing him on the screen.",4,Quite enjoyable.

It takes an affectionate look back at the series, it's impact, and how it effected the lives of the five actors who sat in the Captains chair. One recurrent theme is the toll it took on their marriages. Three of the five actors went through painful divorces, during their tenure on their respective shows. Often they were told they'd be home by 6:30, which turned in to 9:30 with a morning wake up time of 5 am. Kate Mulgrew, who was a single mom at the time, experienced resentment from her children, who to this day won't watch the show on re-runs.You learn something (a little bit) about the actor's life working on series television. You learn what it means in terms of financial security being cast in a series with such a large following, that it's fans are willing to support you by paying for the privilege of an autograph at conventions. You see the impact a form of popular entertainment can have on the lives of its fans and how the trajectory of a life can change, for both the actor and the audience.You get the ""where are they now?"" Avery Brooks is a tenured professor of theater at some University. Kate Mulgrew is artistic director of some Theatre company in New York. Patrick Stewart is still doing theater.

Shatner, who has shown his prowess at producing an expertness while exploring a subject's mind (...on his recent interview series) just seems to letthe individual pull him along and mostly to places droll. As much a fan I am of Avery Brooks (and not for Deep Space 9- I am not much of a fan of any Berman Trek-but as Hawk On ""Spenser: Zor Hire"", he just didn't seem to be either in the same plane as WS or was not wanting to discuss a past series (the people with me were veryturned off at his apparent aloof-ish-ness; I just saw him as being elsewhere for the time).See this for Bakula and Pine, and Stewart (who is always engaging [get it??

Bill Shatner has a way of coming across as ""bigger than life""... or, perhaps, ""more self-serving than life"", in some people's eyes. OK, fine. I actually do get that.But... I just watched this film, and it is absolutely NOT an example of that.Mr. Shatner does, indeed, tell a few stories, in EXTREMELY abbreviated form. But about 99% of the the time, he lets the other ""captains"" tell _their_ stories.Which is, actually, both a blessing and a curse... yes, I want to hear these stories of the ""other"" captains... in fact, the damn movie was TOO SHORT... these stories were too short. EACH ""captain of the Enterprise"" could easily fill an entire movie with their feelings and anecdotes, and I would, quite gladly, buy them all. It was a blessing, I suppose, that, despite reviews to the contrary, that Shatner dominates... except... he just doesn't. He doesn't at all. Which is the ""curse"" part. Who wouldn't want to hear Bill Shatner REALLY telling his tale of Star Trek... not the stories we've already heard... not the sanitized and (probably) altered and, even, mainly made-up stories, but the REAL stories?Bill Shatner meets with the other actors who played captains on the various incarnations of Star Trek, and asks them insightful, meaningful questions... and those actors actually answer, in meaningful and insightful ways.What more could you ask for?I'll tell you what... bear with me...It was GREAT. I LOVED it.The one thing missing was... Shatner. Being just as insightful and open and as forthright as those he interviewed.Shatner didn't dominate this, not at all. I do not know where those comments are coming from. I just watched this, literally. And Shatner was a part of it, of course. But this film was NOT, in any way way, a Shatner ego-trip.Truly, the one thing missing from this film... the one ""captain of the Enterprise"" we DID NOT hear from, in this film, is.... the original Captain Kirk himself, William Shatner.So... despite others intimations that this is a ""Shatner self-love"" film, I respectfully disagree completely. Far from being a ""Shatner ego-trip"", this was, truly, Shatner being an interviewer at his best.And while he got some great, in a few cases truly inspired, responses from the other ""captains"", what was honestly missing was... the Shatner captain.A ""Shatner-fest""? No. Simply, no. It isn't.Perfect? No. Simply, no, it isn't.Why? I'll tell you why. Three words: TOO DAMN SHORT.You can not... you CAN not... adequately interview that many actors, all who have played such a pivotal role in such a time-honored series, in less than two hours... 12, 15, 20, maybe even 40 or 50 hours... MIGHT start to approach filling the need... maybe.And we didn't even BEGIN to get William Shatner's views. That might take 10 or 20, or more, hours by itself, if an interviewer as insightful as Shatner himself was doing the interview.But what made it to the final print of this film is... truly, quite excellent.And... I'll say it again... far from being a ""Shatner ego-trip"" as others have said, this film is barely about Shatner at all. It just isn't. He's the interviewer -- and he stays, almost completely, in that role.OK... way long review. Fine. Summary: EXTREMELY pleased with this, although it was too short and, in the process, gave NONE of the actors a proper stage for telling what we all want to hear. Anyone interested in this will be both thrilled and disappointed, because you get to see them all, and hear from them all, and none of them get a real chance to talk. But I do, totally, recommend it.The biggest thing missing, other than about 10 hours per Captain (which we really do want to see and hear) is, we don't get to hear from SHATNER'S captain... a sore lack. The REAL original. The one EVERYTHING else is based on... and we hear very little, indeed, from him, in this film.",5,"VERY good, too short",1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,3896,"['OK', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'anti-Shatner', 'stuff', 'coming', 'from.Yes', 'Bill', 'Shatner', 'way', 'coming', 'bigger', 'life', 'perhaps', 'more', 'self-serving', 'life', 'people', 'eyes', 'OK', 'fine', 'actually', 'do', 'get', 'that.But', 'just', 'watched', 'film', 'absolutely', 'NOT', 'example', 'that.Mr', 'Shatner', 'indeed', 'tell', 'few', 'stories', 'EXTREMELY', 'abbreviated', 'form', '99', '%', 'time', 'other', 'captains', 'tell', '_their_', 'stories.Which', 'actually', 'blessing', 'curse', 'yes', 'want', 'hear', 'stories', 'other', 'captains', 'fact', 'damn', 'movie', 'was', 'TOO', 'SHORT', 'stories', 'were', 'too', 'short', 'EACH', 'captain', 'Enterprise', 'could', 'easily', 'fill', 'entire', 'movie', 'feelings', 'anecdotes', 'would', 'quite', 'gladly', 'buy', 'was', 'blessing', 'suppose', 'reviews', 'contrary', 'Shatner', 'dominates', 'just', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'Which', 'curse', 'part', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'Bill', 'Shatner', 'REALLY', 'telling', 'tale', 'Star', 'Trek', 'not', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'already', 'heard', 'not', 'sanitized', 'probably', 'altered', 'even', 'mainly', 'made-up', 'stories', 'REAL', 'stories', 'Bill', 'Shatner', 'meets', 'other', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'captains', 'various', 'incarnations', 'Star', 'Trek', 'insightful', 'meaningful', 'questions', 'actors', 'actually', 'answer', 'meaningful', 'insightful', 'ways.What', 'more', 'could', 'ask', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'what', 'bear', 'was', 'GREAT', 'LOVED', 'it.The', 'one', 'thing', 'missing', 'was', 'Shatner', 'Being', 'just', 'insightful', 'open', 'as', 'forthright', 'interviewed.Shatner', 'did', ""n't"", 'dominate', 'not', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'comments', 'are', 'coming', 'just', 'watched', 'literally', 'Shatner', 'was', 'part', 'course', 'film', 'was', 'NOT', 'way', 'way', 'Shatner', 'ego-trip.Truly', 'one', 'thing', 'missing', 'film', 'one', 'captain', 'Enterprise', 'DID', 'NOT', 'hear', 'film', 'original', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'William', 'Shatner.So', 'others', 'intimations', 'Shatner', 'self-love', 'film', 'respectfully', 'disagree', 'completely', 'Far', 'being', 'Shatner', 'ego-trip', 'was', 'truly', 'Shatner', 'being', 'interviewer', 'best.And', 'got', 'great', 'few', 'cases', 'truly', 'inspired', 'responses', 'other', 'captains', 'what', 'was', 'honestly', 'missing', 'was', 'Shatner', 'captain.A', 'Shatner-fest', 'No', 'Simply', ""isn't.Perfect"", 'Simply', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'why', 'Three', 'words', 'TOO', 'DAMN', 'SHORT.You', 'can', 'not', 'CAN', 'not', 'adequately', 'interview', 'many', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'played', 'pivotal', 'role', 'such', 'time-honored', 'series', 'less', 'two', 'hours', '12', '15', '20', 'maybe', 'even', '40', '50', 'hours', 'MIGHT', 'start', 'approach', 'filling', 'need', 'maybe.And', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'BEGIN', 'get', 'William', 'Shatner', 'views', 'might', 'take', '10', '20', 'more', 'hours', 'interviewer', 'as', 'insightful', 'Shatner', 'was', 'doing', 'interview.But', 'what', 'made', 'final', 'print', 'film', 'truly', 'quite', 'excellent.And', ""'ll"", 'say', 'again', 'far', 'being', 'Shatner', 'ego-trip', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'film', 'barely', 'Shatner', 'just', ""n't"", 'interviewer', 'almost', 'completely', 'role.OK', 'way', 'long', 'review', 'Fine', 'Summary', 'EXTREMELY', 'pleased', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'process', 'gave', 'NONE', 'actors', 'proper', 'stage', 'telling', 'what', 'want', 'hear', 'Anyone', 'interested', 'will', 'be', 'thrilled', 'disappointed', 'get', 'see', 'hear', 'none', 'get', 'real', 'chance', 'talk', 'do', 'totally', 'recommend', 'it.The', 'biggest', 'thing', 'missing', 'other', '10', 'hours', 'Captain', 'really', 'do', 'want', 'see', 'hear', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hear', 'SHATNER', 'captain', 'sore', 'lack', 'REAL', 'original', 'one', 'EVERYTHING', 'else', 'based', 'hear', 'very', 'little', 'indeed', 'film']","Captains, the - A Film by William Shatner"
1455486,A24ZMNWTW8AQUR,B005DEUEV8,"SciFiChick ""The SciFiChick""","[3, 5]","The Captains is a documentary written and directed by William Shatner that follows the actor on in-depth interviews with the other five actors that have played captains on Star Trek. His mission was to discover what commonalities they all had and what brought them to the roles of their iconic characters.Shatner (Captain Kirk of the original Star Trek) interviews Sir Patrick Stewart (Captain Picard of Star Trek: The Next Generation) at his home in London, Avery Brooks (Captain Sisko of Star Trek: Deep Space 9) in New Jersey, Kate Mulgrew (Captain Janeway of Star Trek: Voyager) in New York, and Scott Bakula (Captain Archer of Star Trek: Enterprise) and Chris Pine (Captain Kirk of the Star Trek 2009 film) in Los Angeles.Each interview was unique to the actor's personalities and provides a thoughtful and poignant look at each actor. Shatner does a great job of tailoring each interview and creating a unique experience. His interview with Stewart is by far the most interesting, as the two actors share experiences and an obvious camaraderie. The interview with Brooks is unfortunately awkward and strange. Poor Shatner asks questions, and gets Brooks responding with nothing but piano music. It's both painful and humorous to watch. The interview with Mulgrew is both light-hearted and moving. Shatner's interview with Bakula is by far the most relaxed and down-to-earth, as Bakula has that easy-going personality that made him a joy to watch. And the interview with Pine was the shortest. Though Pine, of course, has only starred in one feature film so far, as opposed to all of the others in multiple seasons of television. I still would have liked to see more interaction between the two. After all, Pine is the one ""current"" captain continuing the franchise at the moment.Since Shatner was the first, and arguably the most important captain in the Star Trek since he set the bar for all others following, I only wish he would have had someone specifically interviewing himself as well. Instead, he had to insert his point of view in his various interviews with all of the other actors, which made it feel like more of a conversation than interviews at times.As a Star Trek fan, I found the documentary very interesting and well-developed. Shater has a unique perspective and can relate to each of them.  Dramatic, seemingly heartfelt, with plenty of humor - The Captains is an excellent behind-the-scenes look at some of Star Trek's most beloved actors.Bonus Feature:""The Making of The Captains""",4,Interesting and Well-Developed,1320278400,"11 3, 2011",2011,2508,"['Captains', 'documentary', 'written', 'directed', 'William', 'Shatner', 'actor', 'in-depth', 'interviews', 'other', 'five', 'actors', 'have', 'played', 'captains', 'Star', 'Trek', 'mission', 'was', 'discover', 'what', 'had', 'what', 'brought', 'roles', 'iconic', 'characters.Shatner', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Sir', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Captain', 'Picard', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'home', 'London', 'Avery', 'Brooks', 'Captain', 'Sisko', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Deep', 'Space', '9', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', 'Captain', 'Janeway', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'New', 'York', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'Captain', 'Archer', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'Star', 'Trek', '2009', 'film', 'Los', 'Angeles.Each', 'interview', 'was', 'unique', 'actor', 'personalities', 'thoughtful', 'poignant', 'look', 'actor', 'Shatner', 'great', 'job', 'tailoring', 'interview', 'creating', 'unique', 'experience', 'interview', 'Stewart', 'far', 'most', 'interesting', 'two', 'actors', 'share', 'experiences', 'obvious', 'camaraderie', 'interview', 'Brooks', 'unfortunately', 'awkward', 'strange', 'Poor', 'Shatner', 'questions', 'Brooks', 'responding', 'nothing', 'piano', 'music', 'painful', 'humorous', 'watch', 'interview', 'Mulgrew', 'light-hearted', 'moving', 'Shatner', 'interview', 'Bakula', 'far', 'most', 'relaxed', 'down-to-earth', 'Bakula', 'easy-going', 'personality', 'made', 'joy', 'watch', 'interview', 'Pine', 'was', 'shortest', 'Though', 'Pine', 'course', 'only', 'starred', 'one', 'feature', 'film', 'so', 'far', 'opposed', 'others', 'multiple', 'seasons', 'television', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'interaction', 'two', 'Pine', 'one', 'current', 'captain', 'continuing', 'franchise', 'moment.Since', 'Shatner', 'was', 'first', 'arguably', 'most', 'important', 'captain', 'Star', 'Trek', 'set', 'bar', 'others', 'following', 'only', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'someone', 'specifically', 'interviewing', 'as', 'well', 'Instead', 'had', 'insert', 'point', 'view', 'various', 'interviews', 'other', 'actors', 'made', 'feel', 'more', 'conversation', 'interviews', 'times.As', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fan', 'found', 'documentary', 'very', 'interesting', 'well-developed', 'Shater', 'unique', 'perspective', 'can', 'relate', 'Dramatic', 'seemingly', 'heartfelt', 'plenty', 'humor', 'Captains', 'excellent', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'Star', 'Trek', 'most', 'beloved', 'actors.Bonus', 'Feature', 'Making', 'Captains']","Captains, the - A Film by William Shatner"

Although Stewart certainly seems to have played himself...as it seems all of these actors did. Perhaps being a Captain on Star Trek allows one to do that, as its such a personal sort of role.However, wonderful insight into these actors, and the characters they played even when the information is not overt and spoon fed. And certainly, Patrick Stewart in a sense is given this wonderful ""thank you"" from Shatner for making clear that Star Trek was indeed ""great Art"" and worth doing.Heroic Idealism is a lost concept on most television and film today. It's what makes the present Star Trek film ridiculously cool and...ridiculous...period.Shatner knows this, and even the exchange between himself and Chris Pine was wonderful in what wasn't said. Shatner's slightly veiled, less than overt contempt (perhaps not for Pine directly, but what he represents) is amusing and contagious. And his utter respect for all the other actors is wonderful.Avery's energy is also incredible and you can see the power in the man's eyes, and we are given the treat of listening to his music. Loved Bakula as well.Someone else leveled the same old ""BIG EGO"" charge against Shatner in a previous review. In Latin, EGO means ""I"". Self-esteem. The SELF. The singular component that made America great, and her best television series - the sanctity of YOU above the collective (Borg, Klingon or otherwise). The one that showed us a way to our future, and made it happen.  All of this through the sheer force of will of a man who through his ahem fictional ""cowboy diplomacy"", womanizing and understanding of the value of Individualism, created a franchise that will likely last forever until it stops being Science Fiction and begins to turn into Science Reality...which I believe it has.My thanks to Shatner for making this film and for his wonderful work in acting.

1455489,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,B005DEUEV8,Steffan Piper,"[8, 12]","The Captains is easily one of the most touching and thoughtful Star Trek documentaries that I ever have seen. I've seen many and none are this engagingThis is William Shatner's, now eighty years old,  reflective and very personal look into the lives of the people that signed on to be these characters and pushing each one to basically unload the luggage and examine the cost on their personal lives because of their commitment to the show.Eighteen hour days, day after day, year after year, while either being married -- or being a single mom, as Kate Mulgrew was with two very young children, Having families that never see you except on weekends, while you were wrecked and sleeping it all off just to recoup and go again ... this is the story that each one of them recounts back.I think the first thought that most people who watch this will come away with, is that Avery Brooks has gone crazy ... but that's not really the whole story, and I doubt he is.I've written before about Avery Brooks and Star Trek and how badly he was treated by the Producers in the franchise and by Paramount as a whole themselves. Avery basically talks to Bill Shatner through his piano, obliquely. Everything Avery says is evasive and a bit removed from the topic. He often shoots Shatner's question directly back to him.While it is disconcerting, it is saddening to see that he's just not ready to talk about his experiences as Ben Sisko yet. It's too bad, too, as a lot of time has passed since Deep Space Nine, but obviously for Avery Brooks, not enough time. He is, very clearly, going through some of the same pains that Shatner did for many years regarding Star Trek, his role as Captain, his career after Star Trek and Paramounts handling of him.Bill Shatner admits that he always felt a sense of `Derision' regarding his role and time on Star Trek, the fans, people saying `beam me up,' his legacy and leaving this world being known as `Captain Kirk.' It bothered him to no end, and when people on the street would tell him, year after year, that Captain Kirk and Star Trek changed their life, he inwardly never believed it and just thought that these people were hyped up and caught in the make-believe mystical nature of Hollywood and nothing else.Patrick Stewart's deep devotion to Star Trek for the length of the show and not wanting the project to fail, cost him much in his own personal life which he had to turn his back on - giving him long-standing regrets. He had told himself that the job and the craft was more important than his own family - no joke. Patrick Stewart's interview woven through this film is touching, gratifying and explanatory on so many levels. Yes, you need to be a Star Trek fan to appreciate this, but as always, the message and the lesson here is much greater than Star Trek itself.Patrick Stewart's conversation regarding his regrets is worth watching this for that alone, as I have often submitted to people that if you don't have any regrets, then you really haven't lived your life fully. Regrets are a natural condition of relationships and caring for people. I'm sure you can finish this thought by yourself. Watch it, and you'll probably never misunderstand that point again or have your own peace on it.Kate Mulgrew's story about her life, her children and the impossibility of trying to work those long days, deliver the highly developed techno-speak embedded in the show, and be real - all while worrying about her two young children that she never got to see - and then having to emulate a constant, strong leader is incredible and creates a sad ironic absurdity that you just wouldn't expect.Scott Bakula and Chris Pine are also interviewed and equally interesting. Both are honest and sincere and giving to Shatner's questioning, which is at times interruptive. But by the time you become heavily entangled in Patrick Stewart's narrative, it easily becomes the main theme.This isn't about how Star Trek has changed our lives or technology, but something more inward - how Star Trek changed the lives of these people who would be Captain of the Enterprise and what it was that they lost from it and also what they gained.I was riveted during the entirety of this and didn't expect to be.

The genius/madness/wackness of Shatner ground on me, initially, like nails on chalkboard, and his blatant interruptions of guests, not to mention somewhat horrendous ""beat-poetry"" with Avery, made me reach for my remote, finger hovering over the stop button.But I came back to it, for what I would estimate as the last 3/4, and to say it redeemed itself would be an understatement.  Like any eccentric character, you have to warm up to Shatners antics, and look for the sincerity amongst the ego.  He'll interrupt Patrick Stewart, who is making a profound thought verbal, with some inconsequential question about the smallest of detail, yet tie it all together before its over with and give everyone enough latitude to truly make the interviews two-way.  This is a unique but highly interactive interview technique, and as I saw more of it, I grew to like it.There are some moments, as mentioned before with Avery, that leave you chuckling uncomfortably, but the majority of interactions between Shatner and his fellow captains are earnest, heartfelt, painful, uplifting, and humorous.  Pine is the weakest link, but his time on this earth is a fraction of the others.  Scott Bakula's catharsis with Shatner about divorce was poignant, and Stewart's earnestness about the love of his craft left me misty-eyed.Speaking of misty-eyed, the shots from the convention really reminded me what I think most of us that love Star Trek are in it for: the celebration of the ideals and universe that Roddenberry imagined and many have developed into the mythos we have today.  As quirky as Shatner is, he works the crowd with such expertise and mastery, you can see the mythical leader Kirk come out in what throughout most of the documentary appears a heavy-set, tired man.  Add in the tangible love from the fans, the electricity in the air, and the cameo by Stewart, and you feel like you are in the crowd.Shatner wraps it all up with an insight that seems so basic to the rest of us, but is brutally honest. The self-discovery portion of this film punctuates the ending to what started as an odd journey and ends with him saying out loud what we all know:  if you are receptive to it, Star Trek can change your life.",5,I almost turned it off,1320883200,"11 10, 2011",2011,2271,"['one', 'most', 'oddly', 'paced', 'documentaries', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'genius/madness/wackness', 'Shatner', 'ground', 'initially', 'nails', 'chalkboard', 'blatant', 'interruptions', 'guests', 'not', 'mention', 'somewhat', 'horrendous', 'beat-poetry', 'Avery', 'made', 'reach', 'remote', 'finger', 'hovering', 'stop', 'button.But', 'came', 'back', 'what', 'would', 'estimate', 'last', '3/4', 'say', 'redeemed', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'eccentric', 'character', 'have', 'warm', 'up', 'Shatners', 'antics', 'look', 'sincerity', 'ego', ""'ll"", 'interrupt', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'who', 'making', 'profound', 'thought', 'verbal', 'inconsequential', 'question', 'smallest', 'detail', 'yet', 'tie', 'together', 'give', 'everyone', 'enough', 'latitude', 'truly', 'make', 'interviews', 'two-way', 'unique', 'highly', 'interactive', 'interview', 'technique', 'saw', 'more', 'grew', 'are', 'moments', 'mentioned', 'Avery', 'leave', 'chuckling', 'uncomfortably', 'majority', 'interactions', 'Shatner', 'fellow', 'captains', 'are', 'earnest', 'heartfelt', 'painful', 'uplifting', 'humorous', 'Pine', 'weakest', 'link', 'time', 'earth', 'fraction', 'others', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'catharsis', 'Shatner', 'divorce', 'was', 'poignant', 'Stewart', 'earnestness', 'love', 'craft', 'left', 'misty-eyed.Speaking', 'misty-eyed', 'shots', 'convention', 'really', 'reminded', 'what', 'think', 'most', 'love', 'Star', 'Trek', 'are', 'celebration', 'ideals', 'universe', 'Roddenberry', 'imagined', 'many', 'have', 'developed', 'mythos', 'have', 'today', 'As', 'quirky', 'Shatner', 'crowd', 'such', 'expertise', 'mastery', 'can', 'see', 'mythical', 'leader', 'Kirk', 'come', 'out', 'what', 'most', 'documentary', 'heavy-set', 'tired', 'man', 'Add', 'tangible', 'love', 'fans', 'electricity', 'air', 'cameo', 'Stewart', 'feel', 'are', 'crowd.Shatner', 'up', 'insight', 'so', 'basic', 'rest', 'brutally', 'honest', 'self-discovery', 'portion', 'film', 'ending', 'what', 'started', 'odd', 'journey', 'saying', 'out', 'loud', 'what', 'know', 'are', 'receptive', 'Star', 'Trek', 'can', 'change', 'life']","Captains, the - A Film by William Shatner"
