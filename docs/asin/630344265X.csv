374830,A2ZNJKY01ANDHG,630344265X,"John A. Kuczma ""RogueUlfric""","[9, 9]","The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory is a significantly better representation of the historic battle than its better known namesake.  The production values are quite good, considering that a substantial amount of the  fighting during the siege, including the climactic final attack, were at  night, a fact accurately depicted in this film.There is still a good  deal of cliched heroism of dubious accuracy, and the acting is little more  than mediocre, but the producers and the director allow the event to be the  star of the show, minimizing the effect of these shortcomings.Somewhat  understated in tone and a bit slow to develop, the movie's seeming early  weakness becomes its greatest strength as the events slowly build to their  finale.  The final battle is brilliantly filmed, using a variety of camera  angles, quick cut-aways, and the blinding flashes of gunfire in the  pre-dawn darkness to give the viewer a sense of the confusion and terror  the befell the defenders during the terrifying attack.Thirteen Days to  Glory may not be Academy Award material, but it is a very noteworthy  attempt to accurately portray the events at the Alamo as they actually  happened.  The result is a fine mix of valid history and entertaining  filmmaking.  Recommended for anyone interested in this stirring saga of  Texican history.",4,A bit closer to what really happened. . . .,946857600,"01 3, 2000",2000,1327,"['Alamo', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'Glory', 'significantly', 'better', 'representation', 'historic', 'battle', 'better', 'known', 'namesake', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'considering', 'substantial', 'amount', 'fighting', 'siege', 'including', 'climactic', 'final', 'attack', 'were', 'night', 'fact', 'accurately', 'depicted', 'film.There', 'still', 'good', 'deal', 'cliched', 'heroism', 'dubious', 'accuracy', 'acting', 'little', 'more', 'mediocre', 'producers', 'director', 'event', 'be', 'star', 'show', 'minimizing', 'effect', 'understated', 'tone', 'bit', 'slow', 'develop', 'movie', 'seeming', 'early', 'weakness', 'greatest', 'strength', 'events', 'slowly', 'build', 'finale', 'final', 'battle', 'brilliantly', 'filmed', 'using', 'variety', 'camera', 'angles', 'quick', 'cut-aways', 'blinding', 'flashes', 'gunfire', 'pre-dawn', 'darkness', 'give', 'viewer', 'sense', 'confusion', 'terror', 'befell', 'defenders', 'terrifying', 'attack.Thirteen', 'Days', 'Glory', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Academy', 'Award', 'material', 'very', 'noteworthy', 'attempt', 'accurately', 'portray', 'events', 'Alamo', 'actually', 'happened', 'result', 'fine', 'mix', 'valid', 'history', 'entertaining', 'filmmaking', 'Recommended', 'anyone', 'interested', 'stirring', 'saga', 'Texican', 'history']",The Alamo - Thirteen Days To Glory VHS

374832,AQBLXHQ7O3H37,630344265X,mike l,"[0, 0]",I really wanted to like this movie. As a native born Texan and frequent visitor of the Alamo. The movie was made for TV and just didn't have the feel of the other two Alamo movies. I would rank it 3rd behind the John Wayne movie. First going to the movie made in 2004. Non of the actors were believable.The generals wedding and Jim Bowie falling off the roof did it for me. I think I saw a couple of Mexican soldiers die from boredom.,2,Alamo.....I watched it till I fell asleep from boredom.,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,434,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'native', 'born', 'Texan', 'frequent', 'visitor', 'Alamo', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'feel', 'other', 'two', 'Alamo', 'movies', 'would', 'rank', '3rd', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movie', 'First', 'going', 'movie', 'made', '2004', 'Non', 'actors', 'were', 'believable.The', 'generals', 'wedding', 'Jim', 'Bowie', 'falling', 'off', 'roof', 'did', 'think', 'saw', 'couple', 'Mexican', 'soldiers', 'die', 'boredom']",The Alamo - Thirteen Days To Glory VHS
