729493,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00007JME6,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[91, 92]","This DVD contains two excellent yoga practices which are perfect for virtually all levels of yoga practitioners, particularly advanced beginners to intermediates. Although both practices are labelled as being 20 minutes long, the actual time varies a bit: AM Yoga has a 4-minute breathing exercise followed by a 12-minute yoga program, and PM Yoga is approximately 24 minutes.  Although both of these programs are probably doable to those new to yoga, they do assume some prior familiarity with the poses (total yoga newbies will find Yoga Journal's Yoga Practice for Beginners to be an excellent place to start). I have been practicing yoga for several years and am now at an intermediate level, but I continue to use both of these practices on a regular basis.AM Yoga provides a practice so gentle that I've frequently performed it upon first waking up and while still in my pajamas. The simple breathing exercise helps your mind to focus, and then the basic twists and other poses which follow help your body to awaken. The practice is led by Rodney Yee, an excellent instructor who provides flawless cuing and who has an extremely calm, soothing voice--ideal for anyone who is not a morning person!  PM Yoga is a very nice practice for winding down, relaxing, and stretching. It also begins with a short focus on breathing, encouraging you to turn your attention inward ""where it's quiet."" The practice moves from a seated to a kneeling position and also includes traditional standing poses such as a warrior and lunges. This is a great end-of-day workout or a quick practice to fit in anytime you need to relax. Patricia Walden is also a very good instructor, but her cuing is not quite as accurate as Rodney's.Overall, I highly recommended this DVD as an essential component of your yoga home practice collection.",5,Two excellent practices for virtually all levels of yogis,1095120000,"09 14, 2004",2004,1819,"['DVD', 'two', 'excellent', 'yoga', 'practices', 'are', 'perfect', 'virtually', 'levels', 'yoga', 'practitioners', 'particularly', 'advanced', 'beginners', 'intermediates', 'practices', 'are', 'labelled', 'being', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'actual', 'time', 'bit', 'AM', 'Yoga', '4-minute', 'breathing', 'exercise', 'followed', '12-minute', 'yoga', 'program', 'PM', 'Yoga', 'approximately', '24', 'minutes', 'programs', 'are', 'probably', 'doable', 'new', 'yoga', 'do', 'assume', 'prior', 'familiarity', 'poses', 'total', 'yoga', 'newbies', 'will', 'find', 'Yoga', 'Journal', 'Yoga', 'Practice', 'Beginners', 'be', 'excellent', 'place', 'start', 'have', 'been', 'practicing', 'yoga', 'several', 'years', 'am', 'now', 'intermediate', 'level', 'continue', 'use', 'practices', 'regular', 'basis.AM', 'Yoga', 'practice', 'so', 'gentle', ""'ve"", 'frequently', 'performed', 'first', 'waking', 'up', 'still', 'pajamas', 'simple', 'breathing', 'exercise', 'mind', 'focus', 'then', 'basic', 'twists', 'other', 'poses', 'follow', 'help', 'body', 'awaken', 'practice', 'led', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'excellent', 'instructor', 'who', 'flawless', 'cuing', 'who', 'extremely', 'calm', 'soothing', 'voice', 'ideal', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'morning', 'person', 'PM', 'Yoga', 'very', 'nice', 'practice', 'winding', 'down', 'relaxing', 'stretching', 'also', 'short', 'focus', 'breathing', 'encouraging', 'turn', 'attention', 'inward', 'where', 'quiet', 'practice', 'moves', 'seated', 'kneeling', 'position', 'also', 'traditional', 'standing', 'poses', 'such', 'warrior', 'lunges', 'great', 'end-of-day', 'workout', 'quick', 'practice', 'fit', 'anytime', 'need', 'relax', 'Patricia', 'Walden', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'instructor', 'cuing', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'accurate', ""Rodney's.Overall"", 'highly', 'recommended', 'DVD', 'essential', 'component', 'yoga', 'home', 'practice', 'collection']",A.M. and P.M.

This one has beautiful scenery and music, but I didn't care for the AM practice. In the AM practice Rodney Yee barely hold the poses and it ends up being a very short. It would be a much better if he held the poses, even for a couple of seconds. This would also extend the length of the practice. He also starts with lying down relaxation, which I think is not necessary in the morning (I just wanted to go back to sleep).  On one of the other reviews the person suggests switching the AM and PM practice, so maybe that would work better.The PM practice is very good and you could do this one either in the morning or the evening. The poses are held for a bit longer than the AM routine.You also get a short instruction on the DVD on how to use props and again a very short practice with the props. Also, the DVD has very good menu interface, so that's a plus. You can pick and choose which workout and which segment you'd like to use.If you're looking for a really good AM practice, I would suggest Yoga for Surfers. It's my favorite!

729498,A3FEX2RN3Q5XT4,B00007JME6,C. Daly,"[10, 10]","I keep being told that yoga is supposed to be relaxing, but until I found this DVD, my perception was the opposite.  My first yoga class was a disaster; my legs hurt so much that I could barely walk for the next three days.  Most DVDs I've purchased see yoga as a sport and similarly try to make it hard on the muscles, but this one is different.A.M. Yoga with Rodney Yee is my favorite.  Mr. Yee has a soothing voice that gently relaxes my body.  Instead of strenuous poses, the workout focuses on stretching and meditation.  A beginner who has no familiarity with yoga terminology could easily follow along.  All the positions are fairly natural and gentle.  The only flaw is that I do not think this workout would make me ""energized"" for the day; instead it makes me so relaxed I feel as though I can fall asleep afterward.While Patricia Walden also includes meditation and relaxing exercises in her P.M. Yoga workout, she also includes some more strenuous standing poses.  I would not recommend this workout to a true beginner because she does not provide enough instruction on how to adjust the pose if you are not flexible enough to do it.  In the middle of holding a pose, the screen would occasionally flash to an easier version with props, but this was not shown or described enough to really help a novice.  Once you know your own ability and how to adjust poses to your own flexibility level then you can safely tackle Walden's workout.  The props bonus instruction on this DVD will help somewhat, but you really need a comprehensive instructional DVD in my opinion.If you are looking for a strenuous workout that will build your strength, this is definately not a good buy, but if you want a relaxing way to begin and end your day, check out this DVD.",5,Yoga that's actually relaxing,1111449600,"03 22, 2005",2005,1763,"['keep', 'being', 'told', 'yoga', 'supposed', 'be', 'relaxing', 'found', 'DVD', 'perception', 'was', 'opposite', 'first', 'yoga', 'class', 'was', 'disaster', 'legs', 'hurt', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'barely', 'walk', 'next', 'three', 'days', 'Most', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'purchased', 'see', 'yoga', 'sport', 'similarly', 'try', 'make', 'hard', 'muscles', 'one', 'different.A.M', 'Yoga', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'favorite', 'Mr.', 'Yee', 'soothing', 'voice', 'gently', 'relaxes', 'body', 'Instead', 'strenuous', 'poses', 'workout', 'stretching', 'meditation', 'beginner', 'who', 'familiarity', 'yoga', 'terminology', 'could', 'easily', 'follow', 'along', 'positions', 'are', 'fairly', 'natural', 'gentle', 'only', 'flaw', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'workout', 'would', 'make', 'energized', 'day', 'instead', 'relaxed', 'feel', 'can', 'fall', 'asleep', 'afterward.While', 'Patricia', 'Walden', 'also', 'meditation', 'relaxing', 'exercises', 'P.M.', 'Yoga', 'workout', 'also', 'more', 'strenuous', 'standing', 'poses', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'workout', 'true', 'beginner', 'not', 'provide', 'enough', 'instruction', 'how', 'adjust', 'pose', 'are', 'not', 'flexible', 'enough', 'do', 'middle', 'holding', 'pose', 'screen', 'would', 'occasionally', 'flash', 'easier', 'version', 'props', 'was', 'not', 'shown', 'described', 'enough', 'really', 'help', 'novice', 'know', 'own', 'ability', 'how', 'adjust', 'poses', 'own', 'flexibility', 'level', 'then', 'can', 'safely', 'tackle', 'Walden', 'workout', 'props', 'bonus', 'instruction', 'DVD', 'will', 'help', 'somewhat', 'really', 'need', 'comprehensive', 'instructional', 'DVD', 'opinion.If', 'are', 'looking', 'strenuous', 'workout', 'will', 'build', 'strength', 'definately', 'not', 'good', 'buy', 'want', 'relaxing', 'way', 'begin', 'end', 'day', 'check', 'out', 'DVD']",A.M. and P.M.

This also has 4 segments, with the PM Yoga and also the meditation and relaxation. I found that I also like Patricia Walden's Yoga (almost as much as the AM).5) There is an added part on the DVD where it shows you how to use the Yoga bricks and the mat and the strap for added results and ease in Yoga.I fould this very helpful and have put this to good use.6) The AM Yoga is set in beautiful Maui and the PM is in Death Valley.7) Rodney Yee's voice is so relaxing and added to the DVD.

But after tiring of weight training and cardio(UGH!), I took a chance on yoga. I was a little scared because I'm not exactly the most flexible person but this DVD quickly soothed all of my fears. AM/PM Yoga for beginners is a great introduction to yoga. The DVD is broken into 2 segments: AM Yoga featuring Rodney Yee and PM Yoga with Patricia Walden. The AM Yoga segment runs around 20 minutes including centering, meditation and the actual AM Yoga workout. It is a very gentle and soothing introduction that even a complete beginner can quickly master. Rodney Yee is a great instructor as he easily transitions you from pose to pose with his hypnotic voice guiding you along the way. You will need a yoga strap for a couple of the stretches in AM Yoga. PM Yoga is a bit more challenging as Patricia Walden takes you through a similar but more intense workout. It is also roughly 20 minutes in length. Walton uses yoga blocks to achieve some of the PM Yoga poses but they are not essential. Both workout definitely have their rewards. AM Yoga centers, relaxes, awakens and invigorates the body for the day and PM Yoga centers and relaxes the muscles for rest.

""A New Yorker""","[12, 12]","The last time I had done yoga was about ten years ago so I decided to pick it back up with Rodney Lee due to a number of recommendations. This DVD contains two excellent yoga practices which are perfect for virtually all levels of yoga practitioners, particularly advanced beginners to intermediates and it was perfect for me. Although both practices are labeled as being 20 minutes long, the actual time varies a bit: AM Yoga has a 4-minute breathing exercise followed by a 12-minute yoga program, and PM Yoga is approximately 24 minutes. Both of these programs are probably doable to those new to yoga, they do assume some prior familiarity with the poses (total yoga newbies will find Yoga Journal's Yoga Practice for Beginners to be an excellent place to start).This disc has beautiful scenery and music which is a plus.The AM Yoga provides a practice so gentle that I've frequently performed it upon first waking up and while still in my pajamas. He also starts with lying down relaxation, which I think is not necessary in the morning (I catch myself falling back to sleep).  The simple breathing exercise helps your mind to focus, and then the basic twists and other poses which follow help your body to awaken. Rodney Yee is an excellent instructor who provides flawless cuing and who has an extremely calm, soothing voice--ideal for anyone who is not a morning person! PM Yoga is a very nice practice for winding down, relaxing, and stretching. It also begins with a short focus on breathing, encouraging you to turn your attention inward ""where it's quiet."" The practice moves from a seated to a kneeling position and also includes traditional standing poses such as a warrior and lunges. This is a great end-of-day workout or a quick practice to fit in anytime you need to relax. Patricia Walden is also a very good instructor, but her cuing is not quite as accurate as Rodney's.Overall, I highly recommended this DVD as an essential component of your yoga home practice collection.",5,Rodney  has encountered a new fan,1136937600,"01 11, 2006",2006,1993,"['last', 'time', 'had', 'done', 'yoga', 'was', 'about', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'decided', 'pick', 'back', 'up', 'Rodney', 'Lee', 'due', 'number', 'recommendations', 'DVD', 'two', 'excellent', 'yoga', 'practices', 'are', 'perfect', 'virtually', 'levels', 'yoga', 'practitioners', 'particularly', 'advanced', 'beginners', 'intermediates', 'was', 'perfect', 'practices', 'are', 'labeled', 'being', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'actual', 'time', 'bit', 'AM', 'Yoga', '4-minute', 'breathing', 'exercise', 'followed', '12-minute', 'yoga', 'program', 'PM', 'Yoga', 'approximately', '24', 'minutes', 'programs', 'are', 'probably', 'doable', 'new', 'yoga', 'do', 'assume', 'prior', 'familiarity', 'poses', 'total', 'yoga', 'newbies', 'will', 'find', 'Yoga', 'Journal', 'Yoga', 'Practice', 'Beginners', 'be', 'excellent', 'place', 'start', '.This', 'disc', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'music', 'plus.The', 'AM', 'Yoga', 'practice', 'so', 'gentle', ""'ve"", 'frequently', 'performed', 'first', 'waking', 'up', 'still', 'pajamas', 'also', 'lying', 'down', 'relaxation', 'think', 'not', 'necessary', 'morning', 'catch', 'falling', 'back', 'sleep', 'simple', 'breathing', 'exercise', 'mind', 'focus', 'then', 'basic', 'twists', 'other', 'poses', 'follow', 'help', 'body', 'awaken', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'excellent', 'instructor', 'who', 'flawless', 'cuing', 'who', 'extremely', 'calm', 'soothing', 'voice', 'ideal', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'morning', 'person', 'PM', 'Yoga', 'very', 'nice', 'practice', 'winding', 'down', 'relaxing', 'stretching', 'also', 'short', 'focus', 'breathing', 'encouraging', 'turn', 'attention', 'inward', 'where', 'quiet', 'practice', 'moves', 'seated', 'kneeling', 'position', 'also', 'traditional', 'standing', 'poses', 'such', 'warrior', 'lunges', 'great', 'end-of-day', 'workout', 'quick', 'practice', 'fit', 'anytime', 'need', 'relax', 'Patricia', 'Walden', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'instructor', 'cuing', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'accurate', ""Rodney's.Overall"", 'highly', 'recommended', 'DVD', 'essential', 'component', 'yoga', 'home', 'practice', 'collection']",A.M. and P.M.

The Am routine is a perfect start to anyone's morning and should be accessible to anyone from those who are at intermediate-advanced level yoga to the beginner.

Rodney's pace is great for creating mind/body awareness.Patricia Walden does a great job as well with the evening practice.

Yoga is an good transition from sleeping to activity.  Neither are very strenuous and I found that, as someone completely new to yoga, the poses were easy to get.  The first few times, there were muscles being stretched and used that I didn't know I had, but it still wasn't too hard.  More than anything this DVD is stretching.  Some poses require a little stamina, but overall this is a very approachable routine.There are several warnings and advirtisements before you can access the main menu, but some of them it lets you skip.  The background of the A.M. yoga (with Rodney Yee) is soft ocean waves.  The sound of the surf I found to be relaxing.  The P.M.

729525,AA1HGLBR664VQ,B00007JME6,Scorpio Snake,"[1, 1]","If you don't have a lot of time but still want to do yoga then this DVD is pretty good. Most yoga DVD's go for an hour or more. This makes it hard for someone who has a busy schedule (or kids!). Knowing you can't do the whole thing can discourage you from even starting. Or the beginner who feels intimated by such long secessions. This DVD though has two 20 minute classes. You can even break them up more if you want. Before starting each class you are giving the choice of where to start. Maybe you just want to do the relaxation or meditation secession. With that said, I don't find the two classes being equal. The AM class is really great. It is very relaxing and gives you a good stretch. Your body feels much better afterwards, be it to start the day or end it. Even though it is AM, it is good to do any time of the day, especially if you are feeling stressed or stiff. I am not crazy about the PM yoga, though it may just be my personal tastes. I think that she moves much too fast for someone that is completely new to yoga. She gives instruction as she is doing it, but it seems to leave little time for a beginner to get the pose right before continuing on. The same could be said for AM, as he does the same thing, but the poses are much easier and more focused on relaxing and stretching. I would give the AM class 5 stars and the PM class 3 stars. The DVD is still worth getting, even if just for the AM class. Though you might enjoy the PM more them I have. If you are looking for longer secessions with more instruction then you will probably want to look at another DVD.",3,AM is Really Good,1123804800,"08 12, 2005",2005,1589,"['do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'time', 'still', 'want', 'do', 'yoga', 'then', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'good', 'Most', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'go', 'hour', 'more', 'hard', 'someone', 'who', 'busy', 'schedule', 'kids', 'Knowing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'whole', 'thing', 'can', 'discourage', 'even', 'starting', 'beginner', 'who', 'intimated', 'such', 'long', 'secessions', 'DVD', 'though', 'two', '20', 'minute', 'classes', 'can', 'even', 'break', 'up', 'more', 'want', 'starting', 'class', 'are', 'giving', 'choice', 'where', 'start', 'Maybe', 'just', 'want', 'do', 'relaxation', 'meditation', 'secession', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'two', 'classes', 'being', 'equal', 'AM', 'class', 'really', 'great', 'very', 'relaxing', 'good', 'stretch', 'body', 'feels', 'much', 'better', 'afterwards', 'be', 'start', 'day', 'end', 'Even', 'AM', 'good', 'do', 'time', 'day', 'especially', 'are', 'feeling', 'stressed', 'stiff', 'am', 'not', 'crazy', 'PM', 'yoga', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'personal', 'tastes', 'think', 'much', 'too', 'fast', 'someone', 'completely', 'new', 'yoga', 'instruction', 'doing', 'leave', 'little', 'time', 'beginner', 'get', 'pose', 'right', 'continuing', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'AM', 'same', 'thing', 'poses', 'are', 'much', 'easier', 'more', 'focused', 'relaxing', 'stretching', 'would', 'give', 'AM', 'class', '5', 'stars', 'PM', 'class', '3', 'stars', 'DVD', 'still', 'worth', 'getting', 'even', 'just', 'AM', 'class', 'might', 'enjoy', 'PM', 'more', 'have', 'are', 'looking', 'longer', 'secessions', 'more', 'instruction', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'look', 'DVD']",A.M. and P.M.

The workout begins with a 4 minute conscious relaxation series the focuses on your breathing and almost always puts me back to sleep, but you can skip this section if you want.  The 14 minute yoga series if very good, a series of gentle stretches and exercises to get your blood flowing and to start feeling like you are a live person instead of a zombie.  The 2 minute seated guided meditation set at the end is a great time to focus and relax before getting into your daily routine.  A very soothing and gentle way to slide into your hectic workday.PM Yoga - with instructor Patricia Walden, filmed on the sands of Death Valley.  PM Yoga is a wonderful way to wind down at the end of a stressful or hectic day.  You begin with a series of centering poses, which help you become aware of your body and your breathing.  These stretches help you find out where the tension is in your body and work on your balance.  Then you move into a series of standing poses, where you can target that tension and release it and focus on your breath and what your body is telling you.  At the end, you lie down for some final restorative poses that always make me drift off to sleep.  Patricia has a very soothing voice and does an excellent job at telling you what stretches should feel like and how to breathe and where to release the tension.  A wonderful way to end your day and ensure a good night's rest.I am a total beginner when it comes to Yoga and I have very tight hamstrings so I struggle with a lot of the poses, but I really like this set because the instructors are very clear and precise in their instructions and they are easy to follow.  They don't give you modifications for the stretches, though, and both of them are very flexible so I have to use a yoga block (a must!) or a sturdy book or something to hold onto so I don't lose my balance because I cannot touch the ground.  Still, both sections are very soothing and really do help me to keep my stress level down during the day.  I have found my quality of sleep is much higher and I am not as stressed at work when I take 20 minutes in the morning and evening to take a little time for myself.
