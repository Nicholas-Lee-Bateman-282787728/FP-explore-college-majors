Wearing Louboutins and barely there outfits I was worried.  But USA Networks does what it does best - Covert Affairs is a character driven show with actors who genuinely have chemistry.  The friendship of Annie/Auggie is enough to send even the most mature fangirl into orbit with Piper and Chris' obvious chemistry playing out on film.

She's cute and spunky but it's all a bit hard to believe.  Supporting cast such as the blind, techie Augie, the hard edged boss, and her sister who she lives with (but doesn't know she's an agent) are none very compelling and don't help Perabo carry the load too effectively.  An old flame who dumped her in Sri Lanka and left mysteriously is some rogue agent and it looks like the CIA is using her to track him down.

So we compromised on 3--with the result that neither one of us is happy. ;)Simply put, Covert Affairs is a glamor show, not the serious spy show that a lot of people make it out to be. There's a lot of inaccuracies--the sort you would expect from Hollywood, but those aren't the most serious flaws.Those come in the form of the awkard casting/acting. Simply put, Piper Perabo, while hot, comes across as much too sweet to carry off the role of a kick-a$$ CIA officer. She acts like an annoying little sister when paired with the male agents, and her vaunted abilities are almost never on full display. Worse still is the chemistry or lack thereof between the two bosses, who are married to each other(once again, wouldn't happen in real life.) And finally the actor who plays Annie Walker's boyfriend, a supposedly tough, rugged loner who comes across as sensitive, emotional, and fragile.

1360504,A1Y849AYTGQVIF,B003R4ZMQI,Don Jariyasunant,"[30, 39]","After watching the 1st season of Covert Affairs last summer on USA, I was left with mixed feelings.  The show has a great look, sets and a beautiful and athletic lead actress in Piper Perabo as CIA agent Annie Walker.  Also, the show has a solid creative team behind it led by producer Doug Liman, who was responsible for the Bourne movies.  However out of the 11 episodes, I can honestly say I only enjoyed maybe 5 or 6 at most.  The show was marred by sloppy writing and an inconsistent plotted serialized arc about Annie and a mysterious ex-boyfriend.  When it comes to a rookie show like this, you can expect some growing pains.  There were several other issues I had which included miscasting Sendhil Ramamurthy from Heroes as Jai Wilcox, an Indian-American CIA agent, who helps Annie on several missions.  They also tried to make him a potential love interest for Annie and you can tell right away he had no chemistry with Perabo.  The show also wasted the talented Anne Dudek from House and Mad Man, as Annie's sister who had no clue she's a CIA agent.  And I'm not sure I understand why the writers chose to make Chris Gorham's character Auggie blind.  To me, it added nothing to the show.  Am I supposed to feel sympathy for him?  The character had some chemistry with Annie, but I didn't become attached to him right away.  He did grow on me as the season progressed.  There was another serialized arc in season 1 about a possible leak in the CIA, which went nowhere and had a disappointing resolution.  The show did have some great guest stars including Peter Gallagher, who played a top CIA official, Greg Itzen, Oded Fehr and Eriq LaSalle.After watching the CW show Nikita this past season, I was even more disappointed with Covert Affairs.  Nikita delivered wall to wall action and a very compelling serialized arc with great characters.  Covert Affairs on the other hand, left me with the feeling of what could have been.  Hopefully the writers learned from their mistakes and will make the show compelling this season.  As for purchasing this DVD set, I would wait until there is a significant price drop.",3,"Has Potential, but Needs Work",1306627200,"05 29, 2011",2011,2121,"['watching', '1st', 'season', 'Covert', 'Affairs', 'last', 'summer', 'USA', 'was', 'left', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'show', 'great', 'look', 'sets', 'beautiful', 'athletic', 'lead', 'actress', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Annie', 'Walker', 'Also', 'show', 'solid', 'creative', 'team', 'led', 'producer', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'However', '11', 'episodes', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'only', 'enjoyed', 'maybe', '5', '6', 'most', 'show', 'was', 'marred', 'sloppy', 'writing', 'inconsistent', 'plotted', 'serialized', 'arc', 'Annie', 'mysterious', 'ex-boyfriend', 'When', 'rookie', 'show', 'can', 'expect', 'growing', 'pains', 'were', 'several', 'other', 'issues', 'had', 'included', 'miscasting', 'Sendhil', 'Ramamurthy', 'Heroes', 'Jai', 'Wilcox', 'Indian-American', 'CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'Annie', 'several', 'missions', 'also', 'tried', 'make', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'Annie', 'can', 'tell', 'right', 'away', 'had', 'chemistry', 'Perabo', 'show', 'also', 'wasted', 'talented', 'Anne', 'Dudek', 'House', 'Mad', 'Man', 'Annie', 'sister', 'who', 'had', 'clue', 'CIA', 'agent', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'understand', 'why', 'writers', 'chose', 'make', 'Chris', 'Gorham', 'character', 'Auggie', 'blind', 'added', 'nothing', 'show', 'Am', 'supposed', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'character', 'had', 'chemistry', 'Annie', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'attached', 'right', 'away', 'did', 'grow', 'season', 'progressed', 'was', 'serialized', 'arc', 'season', '1', 'possible', 'leak', 'CIA', 'went', 'nowhere', 'had', 'disappointing', 'resolution', 'show', 'did', 'have', 'great', 'guest', 'stars', 'including', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'who', 'played', 'top', 'CIA', 'official', 'Greg', 'Itzen', 'Oded', 'Fehr', 'Eriq', 'LaSalle.After', 'watching', 'CW', 'show', 'Nikita', 'past', 'season', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'disappointed', 'Covert', 'Affairs', 'Nikita', 'delivered', 'wall', 'wall', 'action', 'very', 'compelling', 'serialized', 'arc', 'great', 'characters', 'Covert', 'Affairs', 'other', 'hand', 'left', 'feeling', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Hopefully', 'writers', 'learned', 'mistakes', 'will', 'make', 'show', 'compelling', 'season', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'set', 'would', 'wait', 'significant', 'price', 'drop']",Covert Affairs: Season One

Instead, ""Covert Affairs"" is all about a young CIA agent's adventures, as she carries out taut, action-packed missions. It's an enjoyable, promising little series, and Piper Perabo makes an enjoyably earnest young agent.Annie Walker (Perabo) is undergoing training to be a CIA agent, and trying to forget her last romance -- her boyfriend Ben (Eion Baile) vanished without a trace, and she hasn't been able to find him.Then she's suddenly pulled out of the program, stationed in Washington, and sent out into the field to use her linguistic skills. So when she isn't trying to have a semi-normal social life and spending time with her sister's family, Annie is diving into some very hard missions under the guidance of blind agent Auggie (Christopher Gorham).She has to deal with a boy-genius, a deadly Venezuelan agent, a disastrous Zurich mission, a Senatorial leak, a computer hacker who wreck's D.C.'s communications, an Iranian refugee, smugglers, an art auction.... and the return of her former lover. At the same time, her bosses have discovered that someone inside the CIA is leaking information to a muckraking journalist.Disclaimer: I am not a CIA agent, and I don't know what it's like to be one. But I assume that ""Covert Affairs"" is a pretty good dramatic depiction of that agency -- there are some obvious flaws (husbands and wives cannot work together in government agencies), but it FEELS much more realistic than many other shows' depictions of the CIA.Every episode has a nice tight mesh of action, drama, and a bit of humor, as Annie grapples with life-threatening scenarios, hails of bullets, villainous agents and the possible deaths of innocents. But somehow she always manages to save the day, and the writers make sure to stay connected to her life with her family (such as when Annie's sister tries to set her up on a date).It also helps that Piper Perabo makes a really likable heroine -- Annie is a very earnest, sensible, kind young protagonist, but she also can kick butt. Gorham is a pretty awesome sidekick for her, especially since it's rare to see a disabled person in a TV show like this one. And we have some solid performances by Peter Gallagher and Kari Matchett as Annie's bosses (who are also stormily married), and the megahot Sendhil Ramamurthy.""Covert Affairs Season One"" is a tight, action-packed little series with a likable heroine and some solid stories.

1360528,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003R4ZMQI,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[5, 6]","The USA Network stumbled onto a good thing when it debuted the offbeat MONK back in 2002, but it quickly picked up on its now trademark winning formula. Not too long after, the ""Characters welcome"" slogan began making its rounds. Nowadays, the USA Network, with its very strong programming, has become an influential player in televisionland. MONK is gone now, but PSYCH, WHITE COLLAR, SUITS, IN PLAIN SIGHT, and BURN NOTICE follow the tradition of compelling, quirky characters who anchor highly watchable shows. COVERT AFFAIRS continues the splendid streak. It introduces - and, for some, re-introduces - Piper Perabo whom the camera adores.When one has traveled the world, has gotten one's heart broken to bits, and has mastered six languages, well, why not dip a toe in the spy game? 28-year-old Anne Catherine Walker, new recruit to the the Farm, is yanked from CIA training with only one month to go and is suddenly thrust into field work. Obviously the CIA has an agenda, and maybe it's not even Annie's polyglot skills that got her initially tapped for the cloak and dagger. It all plays out thru the course of Season One's eleven episodes. We see Annie flounder and make mistakes. But we also see her gain experience and confidence. We see her come of age. Her instincts have always been sound, even if she sometimes dismisses proper protocol.In the world of high stakes espionage, a field agent routinely uses people and in turn is used by them. The phrase ""in the interest of transparency"" is often utilized by these operatives with an absolute absence of irony. The internal politics are murder and, for Annie, made even more murderous by virtue of her two immediate supervisors (Kari Matchett, Peter Gallagher) working thru their rocky marriage. Sometimes, the CIA's policy of encouraging its staff to keep even their love life within the family can backfire. Annie does make one friend, and I'm sure any number of girlish hearts were set a-flutter once Christopher Gorham entered the scene. Gorham plays Auggie Anderson, the blind ex-Special Forces agent who now runs the CIA's tech ops. Auggie creates an immediate impression. There's instant heat between Gorham and Perabo, and we can't shake the feeling, can't we, that these two's relationship will gradually evolve beyond deep friendship? I don't think it's coincidental that my two favorite episodes are the pilot episode, which introduces Annie Walker, and ""Communication Breakdown,"" in which Auggie is deployed to field work when his hacker ex-girlfriend resurfaces with a coveted new hack.Piper Perabo has got one of the coolest, most distinctive names ever. Having seen her in COYOTE UGLY ages ago and being very much taken with her, I've wondered why she never conquered Hollywood. She's got the goods. She has that mobile, wonderfully expressive face, and I can sense her smarts, and she can act. She deftly navigates the minefield of her role, which calls for her to be naive yet competent, compassionate yet ruthless, intuitive yet in the dark. Maybe the series' weakest element is the hackneyed thru arc which has Annie pining for the mystery gent with whom she once had a fling in Sri Lanka for three weeks, until he abandoned her. I'm guessing you won't be that surprised when you learn how he fits into Annie's current life.COVERT AFFAIRS is spy thriller lite. Interestingly, it takes a mostly positive slant on the CIA. Like its sister shows on USA, it parcels out its share of playfulness. It's not as taut or edgy as 24 or as labyrinthine as ALIAS. Annie Walker isn't as world weary or cynical as BURN NOTICE's Michael Westen. There's stuff here that's been done to death. But I can't stay away from the show. I mean, even the theme song - ""Can You Save Me"" by Apple Trees and Tangerines - ropes you in. It's not only the chemistry between Perabo and Gorham that's worth noting. They get good support from Gallagher, the icy Matchett, Sendhil Ramamurthy (fresh off HEROES), the ever slimy Gregory Itzin, and Anne Dudek (who plays Annie's long-suffering sister and who's bought into Annie's cover of working for the Smithsonian museum). Anne Dudek is wonderful, by the way, but there's a frustrating element in how often Annie would have to make up an excuse because a mission has just pulled her away from some scheduled sisterly bonding time. Thankfully, this gets resolved in the middle of Season Two.I dig that Annie thinks that ""James Bond was a lonely sad old man."" I like that she gets her hands dirty but still somehow manages to do the right thing. And, even though she's been trained in martial arts, I like that Annie frequently gets her butt handed to her in life-or-death tussles. It adds believability. But I fear for that day when there won't be a solid object for her to snatch up and wonk the baddie upside the head with. Just one of the perils of covert information wrangling. And Annie Walker, who was thrown abruptly into deep waters, is learning quickly. And all the while looking sexy in a devilish pair of Christian Louboutins (which Auggie mistakenly refers to as ""kitten heels"").The DVD set's bonus stuff:- Audio Commentaries for 3 episodes:

Not because of the actual shows, but Just never get around to that Network due to all the cable shows I watch (HBO-SHOWTIME etc.) but when I saw the CAST of this AMAZING SHOW....I thought WHY? WHY? WHY? AM I NOT WATCHING THIS? I LOVE Chris..huge Ugly Betty fan...Have loved Peter since Sex-Lies....he's a brilliant actor....Kari was in a show I was so upset they took off way too soon called INVASION ...the two of them are sizzling together....Sendhil in Heroes which I still miss...Oded is great....THE ENTIRE CAST IS superb..and PIPER...well I think I've seen her in everything she's done and loved her! So in a matter of a week I plowed through all three seasons of this MAGNIFICENT show!!!!!!!!! Which was a piece of cake to do since its so bloody awesome(Auggie/Annie friendship/relationship kept me up all night(s) to see what was around the corner too) And to find out the people behind the BOURNE movies are involved......well, that was the icing on the cake. The shows are each like a MINI action/adventure/romance movie...brilliantly acted, directed, shot.....LOVE LOCATION SHOWS...just adds so much...and this team does it better than most.....what a happy woman I was to not only discover, albeit a bit late, a show like this...but now it's moved into my Number One slot of faves!! And I have to admit, I'm not a tweenie here....but the romance between Annie and Auggie is sweet and sexy and something I can NOT wait to watch happen in Season Four. And actually VERY thankful I didn't have to suffer three entire years to see this happen between them! I've been raving to all my friends to check this show out now-its up there w/Homeland which for me, is HUGE SINCE that's such a fantastic Emmy-driven show. If you're looking for a great CIA-spy type show...look no further...you have arrived. You've found it!!! (and as far as hot TV couples are concerned....Scandal & all the rest have taken a backseat to CA!!)I hope this show lasts ten seasons or more!

It is dangerous, isolating, sometimes depressing, and secretive. Because the show is designed to entertain, I would guess that the role created for Piper Perabo has more pressure, excitement, and action than most agents in real life experience.

You should watch from the pilot on and not miss an episode!  Especially not the pilot which starts it all off and the story and characters evolve.  Of course, you know now that Piper Perabo was nominated for an emmy for lead actress as CIA agent, Annie Walker, and that her boss's character was fashioned after Valerie Plame...who was technical liaison for the pilot of this fun and great looking show (gorgeous scenery, cast, great sets, locales, fashion and did I say people?!).  A feast for the eyes for everyone along with excellent writing, performances and witty dialogue.I purchased the box set of all Season One's episodes as a gift for my daughter, who does not get the USA Network on her TV.

(POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT FOR ADDI'L SEASONS:  In case there are those who might want to continue collecting seasons, I need to point out some additional info:  I know this is a review of the season 1, but I have to say I disliked the seasons more and more as they went on - .  I finally stopped watching it entirely in the middle of season 3 - the plot devices were convoluted and they were making the main character sort of skanky.  The writers made a love story between two of the characters that sort of jerked the watcher around - will they/won't they and that type of plot device makes me frustrated and annoyed and it's been done to death)  SO... in essence, the first season was great, the second season was interesting but I found myself putting it off to watch other things first and by the middle of season 3, I was done.
