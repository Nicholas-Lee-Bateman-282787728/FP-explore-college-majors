315614,A22MQ2OAHY8SIJ,6302484464,"KittyKins ""KittyKins""","[18, 22]","This is a gripping story that is well acted by all the cast, and is based on the book by Willa Cather. However, this isn't your 'typical' pioneer film. It's very touching, but the ending is very bittersweet. Alexandra's father dies and leaves the farm to her because she is the oldest and has the wisest judgement, even though she is the only girl in the family. Her mother is still alive, but has no interest in the land. Alexandra's brothers listen to her because of their father's command, but sadly really have very little respect for her. Her childhood sweetheart and kindred spirit, Carl, is a budding young artist and leaves town with his family to fulfill his dreams. I found these earlier scenes, played by younger actors to be very sweet and touching. After finding success and making the family rich, Alexandra has to settle issues of her heart when Carl returns 15 years later. She also tries to fulfill a promise to her mother that she will help her youngest brother find a career away from farm life.Sensitive viewers please beware! This is the story of two couples who are separated and are re-united, one ends happily and the other very tragically. I had actually had nightmares after watching this, because it was such a beautiful love story but was rather disturbing in its outcome. Due to the mature storyline of this film &amp; the tragedy, I would not recommend it for younger children. Parents may also find they have to discuss the meaning of adultery, etc. However, I love many of the scenes in this movie which is one reason why the ending was such a disappointment to me. This movie is definitely worthwhile though and has a good message.",4,A Gripping Tragedy &amp; Love Story,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,1664,"['gripping', 'story', 'well', 'acted', 'cast', 'based', 'book', 'Willa', 'Cather', 'However', ""n't"", ""'typical"", 'pioneer', 'film', 'very', 'touching', 'ending', 'very', 'bittersweet', 'Alexandra', 'father', 'dies', 'farm', 'oldest', 'wisest', 'judgement', 'even', 'only', 'girl', 'family', 'mother', 'still', 'alive', 'interest', 'land', 'Alexandra', 'brothers', 'listen', 'father', 'command', 'sadly', 'really', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'respect', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'Carl', 'budding', 'young', 'artist', 'town', 'family', 'fulfill', 'dreams', 'found', 'earlier', 'scenes', 'played', 'younger', 'actors', 'be', 'very', 'sweet', 'touching', 'finding', 'success', 'making', 'family', 'rich', 'Alexandra', 'settle', 'issues', 'heart', 'when', 'Carl', '15', 'years', 'later', 'also', 'fulfill', 'promise', 'mother', 'will', 'help', 'youngest', 'brother', 'find', 'career', 'away', 'farm', 'life.Sensitive', 'viewers', 'please', 'beware', 'story', 'two', 'couples', 'who', 'are', 'separated', 'are', 're-united', 'one', 'happily', 'other', 'very', 'tragically', 'had', 'actually', 'had', 'nightmares', 'watching', 'was', 'such', 'beautiful', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'rather', 'disturbing', 'outcome', 'Due', 'mature', 'storyline', 'film', 'amp', 'tragedy', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'younger', 'children', 'Parents', 'may', 'also', 'find', 'have', 'discuss', 'meaning', 'adultery', 'etc', 'However', 'love', 'many', 'scenes', 'movie', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'ending', 'was', 'such', 'disappointment', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worthwhile', 'though', 'good', 'message']",O Pioneers!

315615,A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT,6302484464,"Linda R. Hendrex ""Rubicon""","[1, 8]","After reading the book, I thought this dumb story might make more sense as a movie, but the flick was long on overwrought music and grand vistas and extremely short on substance.  There was a self importance to this Hallmark movie that promised so much more than it delivered.I especially got tired of the same sweeping scene of ripe farmland that was shown over and over again, and the emotional theme music that was played over and over again, until my psyche was raw from the constant irritation.  This one melody and one scene seemed to be used as cheap filler for a story that did not have enough meat to justify the making of a movie.  I like lush cinema as much as the next person, but all this style without substance doesn't qualify in my opinion.  If there had been just one more long, lingering scene of ""amber waves of grain"", I think I would have screamed!The acting is unbelievably hammy, complete with copious amounts of quivering lips and eyes brimming with tears.  Voices quaver as the characters wallow in sentimentality.  Nothing poignant, just sloppy overemoting.  The movie seemed to be going for an kind of ""Out of Africa"" feel, but didn't even come close.  (I liked OUT OF AFRICA.)Since this is an enduring classic book, I expect there are a lot of people who appreciate it more than I did, but I can't see how anyone could like this movie.  My advice is to read the book, and if it captures your interest, then maybe (just MAYBE) you will get some enjoyment from the video.
