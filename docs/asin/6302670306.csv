327202,A141HP4LYPWMSR,6302670306,Brian E. Erland,"[7, 8]","""A stroll around Mont St Michel, France brings together three highly successful and educated people with disparate worldviews; a politician, a poet and a physicist. A conversation ensues about the nature of reality and the new physics that challenges what we perceive to be the tangible world around us.The '91 film `Mindwalk' is a New Age lecture presented in the guise of a motion picture. It's really quite painless, informative and even enjoyable at times. The tour around St. Michel is wonderful and a stellar cast consisting of Liv Ullmann, Sam Waterston and John Heard make the movie well worth a watch.",4,Keep Playing Those Mind Games Forever ~ The Illusory Nature Of Reality,1208822400,"04 22, 2008",2008,610,"['stroll', 'Mont', 'St', 'Michel', 'France', 'together', 'three', 'highly', 'successful', 'educated', 'people', 'disparate', 'worldviews', 'politician', 'poet', 'physicist', 'conversation', 'nature', 'reality', 'new', 'physics', 'what', 'perceive', 'be', 'tangible', 'world', 'us.The', ""'91"", 'film', 'Mindwalk', 'New', 'Age', 'lecture', 'presented', 'guise', 'motion', 'picture', 'really', 'quite', 'painless', 'informative', 'even', 'enjoyable', 'times', 'tour', 'St.', 'Michel', 'wonderful', 'stellar', 'cast', 'consisting', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'John', 'Heard', 'make', 'movie', 'well', 'watch']",Mindwalk VHS

327204,A2H8NP7I9LF6O8,6302670306,BruceK,"[4, 5]","Ever since I first saw ""Dinner With Andre"" I have a soft spot for movies like this ... meaning anything that tries to be different from the average action or warmed over reruns that we get year after year when new movies come out.  I seek out movies like this and enjoy them mostly.  ""MIndwalk"" is about a conversation between a poet, a scientist and a poltician as they walk around in the island of Mont St. Michel, the castle, in the walls.The scenery is captivating and interesting, the characters are representing ideas that the writer or the movie is using to try to impart his view of life and the universe, a kind of mix of science and poetry, and the politician is there to mediate how to get that message out to people, most of whom are only interested in day to day realities.There was things I liked and disliked about the conversation, and agreed and disagreed with in the ideas.  It does seem the Western civilization is at a crossroads as the world gets smaller, and the Newtonian, Cartesian world versus the Einsteinian world is an allegory for that, but the conversations about physics supporting some of what are religious ideas are idiosyncratic to the writer.  They are nice ideas to listen to and I have nothing against them, and I am glad someone took the time to try to present these ideas in a movie like this, but this is just a conversation among people.There is little change in the characters, action of the sort we see and expect in most movies.  I found it refreshing and enjoyable.  To me the main idea is that we have to start being able to look at ourselves clearly to survive in a world that is changing in ways even the brightest among us do not understand and cannot predict.  The nationalistic idea or identifying with any group and rejecting other groups and using violence to solve our problems cannot continue.One of my favorite movies, even with its flaws.

327207,A2FS38D943KX12,6302670306,chefdevergue,"[7, 24]","How anyone could appreciate this movie after only one viewing is completely beyond my comprehension.  I first saw this on the big screen, and was so totally overwhelmed by the torrent of verbiage that it was difficult to process totally exactly what was being said.  This movie, with its roughly 2 hours of almost non-stop dialogue delivered at a rapid-fire pace, must come close to setting the record in the category of words-to-minutes ratio.Once one has recovered from the movie's &quot;shock &amp; awe&quot; assault on your brain, one can begin to assess the damage.  Speaking as someone with a liberal, pro-environmental outlook, I found this movie to be increasingly disappointing, as it provided neatly-packaged solutions to all of the world's evils &amp; ailments.  Anyone with a liberal outlook should find this approach to be distressing, since it is roughly the same approach that conservative talkshow hosts take...state your opinion as gospel &amp; allow nobody to dissent or question it.  That is not what is commonly defined as a dialogue; it is more a sustained Liv Ullman rant.This movie has to have provided some of the easiest paychecks Sam Waterston &amp; John Heard have ever taken home, as their characters serve as little more than cardboard cutouts, occasionally lobbing up softballs for Ullman to hit out of the ballpark.  Waterston's character seemed perfectly happy to be trampled into the dust while offering no debate at all...one wonders how he ever survived in US politics for more than 5 minutes.Not knowing anything about physics, I cannot speak to the scientific veracity of this film, but it appears from the comments of some of the other reviewers that there are a few flaws in the science as presented therein.  If this is so, one suspects that the makers of the film hoped to take advantage of their viewers' scientific ignorance to make themselves appear the more wise.  The same tactic was applied (in regards to philosophy) by the makers of the &quot;Matrix&quot; movies.  The result is a self-important movie that reveals its shallowness on closer inspection.The cinematography was excellent, and L'Abbaye du Mont-Saint-Michel looks magnificent.  I can't say that the Philip Glass score was overly annoying, but that may simply be because the unrelenting flow of words drowned out the music.

327214,AZ2F4SO8ZJUKV,6302670306,Justin Kownacki,"[13, 19]","Mindwalk is part of a series of eye-opening, mind-expanding treatises on how to better view the universe. It seems a large movement is gaining momentum in this generation, building on the efforts of generations past, to find a more cohesive explanation for how the world works from a subatomic level up to politics and religion. While Mindwalk is a great entry into that new sociological wave, it's certainly not the best of the bunch due to a compressed feeling and lack of emotion.Essentially a daylong conversation about politics, science and art among a politician, a scientist and a poet, Mindwalk provides an entry-level insight into the concept that the various aspects of life may be more intimately linked than we've traditionally believed. The politican and, to some degree, the poet, are surprised to learn this from the scientist, taking on the guise of the novice viewer in that respect. Opinions are shared, examples given -- the most memorable for me being a discussion of the link between music and atoms as accompanied by an antique organ -- and, in the end, all three characters leave their unguided tour of a French castle (a metaphor for the traditional thought process of the human mind?) with a little more insight than they started.As a way of reexamining life and its underlying connections, Midwalk serves a simple and useful purpose. As a film, however, it suffers -- there is no plot, as the characters merely share their views and stumble upon new realizations, which is more suited to a book than a motion picture. Beyond that, the characters aren't really characters at all but types, their individuality muted and refined so as to best embody the three alleged prongs -- science, politics and art -- of the unifying concept. While I'm sure Mindwalk was a wonderful book, its message and its call to think for ourselves, and continue TO think, fails to take advantage of the film medium and instead feels like a recorded stage play.

Not in the let's kill a few people or laugh at people mode, but in the way it tries to explore the effects that modern physics may have on the way we think about the world. If you are at all intellectually curious, you should see this movie. It may not be correct in some places, but the stimulation to think is there.This movies is not intended to be ""art"" in any sense of the word and if you think that it is meant to be, you should look elsewhere.  Fritjof Capra (on whose ideas this film has some basis) has some interesting views about physics which are somewhat ""mystical"" and which I do not necessarily share, however he prodded my thinking with his book ""The Tau of Physics"" when it was first published in 1975 and caused me to look at the world in a different way. This film attempts to do the same using a Poet, a Politician and a Physicist in the backdrop of the Mont St Michel off the coast of France (Brittany) to explain some of the discoveries of modern physics and relate them to how it affects the average person and if, indeed, it really matters whether we understand the underlying structure in the universe. Note the choice of protagonists. The film is excellent in the way it looks at the world through the eyes of the individuals and tries to reconcile the non intutitive deductions of modern physics.Enjoy the film and take it for what it was meant to be, a brief introduction to modern physics and the relevance it may have to us.",5,A useful introduction to the problems raised by science,1101427200,"11 26, 2004",2004,1529,"['comments', 'made', 'other', 'reviewers', 'movie', 'entertainment', 'Not', 'let', 'kill', 'few', 'people', 'laugh', 'people', 'mode', 'way', 'explore', 'effects', 'modern', 'physics', 'may', 'have', 'way', 'think', 'world', 'are', 'intellectually', 'curious', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'correct', 'places', 'stimulation', 'think', 'there.This', 'movies', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'art', 'sense', 'word', 'think', 'meant', 'be', 'should', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'Fritjof', 'Capra', 'ideas', 'film', 'basis', 'interesting', 'views', 'physics', 'are', 'somewhat', 'mystical', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily', 'share', 'however', 'prodded', 'thinking', 'book', 'Tau', 'Physics', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'published', '1975', 'caused', 'look', 'world', 'different', 'way', 'film', 'attempts', 'do', 'same', 'using', 'Poet', 'Politician', 'Physicist', 'backdrop', 'Mont', 'St', 'Michel', 'coast', 'France', 'Brittany', 'explain', 'discoveries', 'modern', 'physics', 'relate', 'how', 'average', 'person', 'indeed', 'really', 'understand', 'underlying', 'structure', 'universe', 'Note', 'choice', 'protagonists', 'film', 'excellent', 'way', 'world', 'eyes', 'individuals', 'tries', 'reconcile', 'non', 'intutitive', 'deductions', 'modern', 'film', 'take', 'what', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'brief', 'introduction', 'modern', 'physics', 'relevance', 'may', 'have']",Mindwalk VHS

It's castle location is splendid, and the actors are very pleasant because their personalities show through.  Enjoyed smiling at the poet's role (John Heard), and also enjoyed the charm of lost-Presidential-race-politician (Sam Waterston), but I felt sorry for all the WORK Liv Ullmann went to just to learn ALL those lines rather than what her character was saying, which took up the majority of the movie.  Perhaps I just don't care for so much philosophy outside the college classroom.  My summation: I'm probably not the audience to fully appreciate this kind of movie in the evening when concentration is ebbing.  I will, however, give it another try, if only to make myself feel brighter.  Perhaps other viewers will give this one a chance.

Like MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, but with people you'd actually like to spend a day with!!  I haven't read all of the other reviews, and though I own it, I haven't watched this film in at least a year. Nevertheless...I remember the exact day, time, weather, and circumstances when I saw it the first time. As a matter of fact, I only saw the last half(the first time) on Bravo, and watched the entire film at least five times in the next week. This film tied together all of my fears, hopes, and dreams for humanity, politics, the ecosystem, and the arts in one...and I didn't even know I was a ""new-ager"". Ironically...this happened between me playing piano for a matinee and evening performance of SOUND OF MUSIC. This film has influenced my choice of books, films and music ever since. (It's not the only influence, but a major one.)I now pay far more attention to world politics,environmental issues, and economics. Give it a shot!!P.S. Now 8/22/04...just got back from a small weekend-long Omega Institute class taught by Fritjof Capra. Systems theory is also known as Complexity Theory and this guy is about HARD science/mathmatics first, not psycho-babble...you can trust the statistics. I am convinced now more than ever that his(and his colleagues') ideas offer a blueprint for the future. Please check out the books, especially the most recent, THE HIDDEN CONNECTIONS.

327223,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,6302670306,William Timothy Lukeman,"[2, 2]","Some films just stick in your mind & make you keep coming back to them, even when you don't necessarily agree with every single point they're making. ""Mindwalk"" is just such a film for me. I'm a little wary of its mild flirtation with New Age fuzziness ... but on the whole, it's a film that makes me think about & question & re-evaluate my view of the world. Add to that the beautiful score by Philip Glass, the serene & mysterious beauty of the Mont Saint-Michel setting, as well as the presence of three very good & attractive actors who leaven the weightiness of the ideas with flashes of wit & basic humanity, and you've got a thoughtful, even contemplative film that will leave you pondering after the final credits roll.Yes, it's essentially a lecture on systems theory -- but it's an entertaining one, making good use of the classical conversation form. If the actors are playing allegorical types more than actual characters, they still bring individuality to those types. Liv Ullman (the Physicist) has to do most of the heavy lifting, and it's sometimes a thankless task; but she's always a pleasure to watch, investing her lines with intelligence & passion. Sam Waterston (the Politician) & John Heard (the Poet) are her bemused, enchanted, but somewhat skeptical foils, reacting to her worldview with curiosity & occasional doubts. The actors are good enough to offer tantalizing glimpses of personal stories that aren't in their lines, and that makes me wish they had been fleshed out more.So ... not a film for everyone, obviously! But for those who want to look below the surface of the everyday, who want to examine the unspoken rules of our culture, it's highly recommended. And just in case you're worried about it being too dry & dogmatic, please note that the final words are offered by the Poet, quoting Kenneth Patchen's ""The Character Of Love Seen As A Search For The Lost"" as twilight descends calmly, inevitably, eternally. In the end, what matters is human longing, fear, and hope. Not a bad conclusion!(So when will we see a DVD?)July 22, 2013 update: Having watched the film several times more since my original review, I'm struck all the more by its continuing relevence, its quiet beauty, and the way the ongoing dialogue among the 3 characters makes me want to join in the discussion. Each time I see it, I find something new & thought-provoking; additionally, I appreciate the deceptive simplicity of the acting, which has to walk a fine line between didacticism & understated naturalism. The actors bring so much to their roles, just by body language, facial expressions, and vocal inflection!And the film also strikes me even more as a midlife film as well, in that all 3 characters have reached a burnout point, a visceral hunger for renewal, even as they look back & re-assess their lives to that point. The final scenes are especially moving & somehow timeless, as if they've been walking along the edge of eternity & are now returning reluctantly but a bit more wisely to the everyday world. How many times have we wished to find ourselves in just such a place, where we can speak from our true, inner selves about the things that matter most to us?Most highly recommended!(And again, we still wait for a DVD -- Criterion, please take note!)",5,Walking & talking in depth,1311638400,"07 26, 2011",2011,3280,"['films', 'just', 'stick', 'mind', 'make', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'even', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'agree', 'single', 'point', ""'re"", 'making', 'Mindwalk', 'just', 'such', 'film', ""'m"", 'little', 'wary', 'mild', 'flirtation', 'New', 'Age', 'fuzziness', 'whole', 'film', 'think', 'question', 're-evaluate', 'view', 'world', 'Add', 'beautiful', 'score', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'serene', 'mysterious', 'beauty', 'Mont', 'Saint-Michel', 'setting', 'as', 'well', 'presence', 'three', 'very', 'good', 'attractive', 'actors', 'who', 'leaven', 'weightiness', 'ideas', 'flashes', 'wit', 'basic', 'humanity', ""'ve"", 'got', 'thoughtful', 'even', 'contemplative', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'pondering', 'final', 'credits', 'roll.Yes', 'essentially', 'lecture', 'systems', 'theory', 'entertaining', 'one', 'making', 'good', 'use', 'classical', 'conversation', 'form', 'actors', 'are', 'playing', 'allegorical', 'types', 'more', 'actual', 'characters', 'still', 'bring', 'individuality', 'types', 'Liv', 'Ullman', 'Physicist', 'do', 'most', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'sometimes', 'thankless', 'task', 'always', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'investing', 'lines', 'intelligence', 'passion', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'Politician', 'John', 'Heard', 'Poet', 'are', 'bemused', 'enchanted', 'somewhat', 'skeptical', 'foils', 'reacting', 'worldview', 'curiosity', 'occasional', 'doubts', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'offer', 'tantalizing', 'glimpses', 'personal', 'stories', 'are', ""n't"", 'lines', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'more.So', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'obviously', 'who', 'want', 'look', 'surface', 'everyday', 'who', 'want', 'examine', 'unspoken', 'rules', 'culture', 'highly', 'recommended', 'just', 'case', ""'re"", 'worried', 'being', 'too', 'dry', 'dogmatic', 'please', 'note', 'final', 'words', 'are', 'offered', 'Poet', 'quoting', 'Kenneth', 'Patchen', 'Character', 'Love', 'Seen', 'A', 'Search', 'Lost', 'twilight', 'descends', 'calmly', 'inevitably', 'eternally', 'end', 'what', 'human', 'longing', 'fear', 'hope', 'Not', 'bad', 'conclusion', 'when', 'will', 'see', 'DVD', 'July', '22', '2013', 'update', 'Having', 'watched', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'more', 'original', 'review', ""'m"", 'struck', 'more', 'continuing', 'relevence', 'quiet', 'beauty', 'way', 'ongoing', 'dialogue', '3', 'characters', 'want', 'join', 'discussion', 'time', 'see', 'find', 'something', 'new', 'thought-provoking', 'additionally', 'appreciate', 'deceptive', 'simplicity', 'acting', 'walk', 'fine', 'line', 'didacticism', 'understated', 'naturalism', 'actors', 'bring', 'so', 'much', 'roles', 'just', 'body', 'language', 'facial', 'expressions', 'vocal', 'inflection', 'film', 'also', 'even', 'more', 'midlife', 'film', 'as', 'well', '3', 'characters', 'have', 'reached', 'burnout', 'point', 'visceral', 'hunger', 'renewal', 'even', 'look', 'back', 're-assess', 'lives', 'point', 'final', 'scenes', 'are', 'especially', 'moving', 'somehow', 'timeless', ""'ve"", 'been', 'walking', 'edge', 'eternity', 'are', 'now', 'returning', 'reluctantly', 'bit', 'more', 'wisely', 'everyday', 'world', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'wished', 'find', 'just', 'place', 'where', 'can', 'speak', 'true', 'inner', 'selves', 'things', 'matter', 'most', 'Most', 'highly', 'recommended', 'again', 'still', 'wait', 'DVD', 'Criterion', 'please', 'take', 'note']",Mindwalk VHS
