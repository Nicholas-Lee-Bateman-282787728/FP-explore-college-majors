This is the story of the attempt to prove it a hoax. The forensic science that went into the effort is detailed. What's interesting, however, is that the more they attempted to prove it a fake, the more the results proved it was probably authentic.So who was Jack the Ripper? You think I'm going to give it away???Warning: some police photos of the victims are shown, including the last one which was especially disgusting.",3,Interested in Crime and Detective Documentaries?,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,515,"['couple', 'years', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'purported', 'diary', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'surfaced', 'story', 'attempt', 'prove', 'hoax', 'forensic', 'science', 'went', 'effort', 'detailed', 'What', 'interesting', 'however', 'more', 'attempted', 'prove', 'fake', 'more', 'results', 'proved', 'was', 'probably', 'authentic.So', 'who', 'was', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'think', ""'m"", 'going', 'give', 'away', 'Warning', 'police', 'photos', 'victims', 'are', 'shown', 'including', 'last', 'one', 'was', 'especially', 'disgusting']",The Diary of Jack the Ripper

A British government department did a forensic examination and dated the diary at the time of the murders.2.  Things described in the diary were kept secret by the police until recently.The only conclusion that comes from these two facts is that the diary was written by either Jack or one of the few police detectives that knew the facts at that time.,5,More of an expose of human nature,1126915200,"09 17, 2005",2005,492,"['What', 'most', 'interesting', 'video', 'way', 'different', 'journalist', 'sift', 'evidence.There', 'are', 'two', 'key', 'items', 'presentation:1', 'British', 'government', 'department', 'did', 'forensic', 'examination', 'dated', 'diary', 'time', 'murders.2', 'Things', 'described', 'diary', 'were', 'kept', 'secret', 'police', 'recently.The', 'only', 'conclusion', 'two', 'facts', 'diary', 'was', 'written', 'Jack', 'one', 'few', 'police', 'detectives', 'knew', 'facts', 'time']",The Diary of Jack the Ripper

Admirably, this DVD documentary keeps to its primary objective: to conclusively identify the Whitechapel murderer!To do this, the documentary examines The Diary of Jack the Ripper a text that documents the diarist's(1) public-self and private-self divide; exacerbated by marriage to an attractive, younger, flirtatious, spirited woman(2) determination to avenge the public insult caused to himself by what he judged to be his wife's public improprieties(3) deepening rage and increasing loss of private sanity (while, characteristically, maintaining public composure)(4) increasing belief in an answer to the 'problem'(5) enactment of the complexly self-deduced answer i.e. the Whitechapel murders(6) vicious reign of public terror accompanied by private glee, public games with letters to the public press for personal entertainment, narcissistic wonderment, cannibalism, and self-gratification(7) sudden physical disintegration; the Whitechapel murders stop(8) knowledge of his own imminent death(9) signature (at close of text) as Jack the Ripper!Additionally, the gross injustices to the young American wife (after the diarist's death) create weighty questions! The most likely answers to those questions also indicate that the diarist is the Whitechapel murderer!Ignoring the conspiratorial and larger social issues that the questions raise, one lighter question persists: What about Doctor Fuller? Was he a hypnotist, drug counselor, a diagnostic incompetent or an early psychologist and genius? Whatever the answer, after the diarist's second consultation with Doctor Fuller, the Whitechapel murders stopped! The diary's madly-mixed shrieks and doggerel are replaced by the type of seductive requests for compassion that one would conventionally expect from an actor leaving the dramatic stage! What did Doctor Fuller say that brought this serial killer to his senses? Learning that answer would benefit medical professionals and police departments throughout the world!For many fields of study, this refreshingly well-researched investigative documentary is recommended!",5,Into the Heart of Darkness Itself!,984614400,"03 15, 2001",2001,2211,"['topsy-turvy', 'inside-out', 'back-to-front', 'slippery-sick-and-poisonous', 'catalog', 'facts', 'surround', 'life', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'Admirably', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'keeps', 'primary', 'objective', 'conclusively', 'identify', 'Whitechapel', 'murderer', 'do', 'documentary', 'Diary', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'text', 'documents', 'diarist', '1', 'public-self', 'private-self', 'divide', 'exacerbated', 'marriage', 'attractive', 'younger', 'flirtatious', 'spirited', 'woman', '2', 'determination', 'avenge', 'public', 'insult', 'caused', 'what', 'judged', 'be', 'wife', 'public', 'improprieties', '3', 'deepening', 'rage', 'increasing', 'loss', 'private', 'sanity', 'characteristically', 'maintaining', 'public', 'composure', '4', 'increasing', 'belief', 'answer', ""'problem"", '5', 'enactment', 'complexly', 'self-deduced', 'answer', 'i.e', 'Whitechapel', 'murders', '6', 'vicious', 'reign', 'public', 'terror', 'accompanied', 'private', 'glee', 'public', 'games', 'letters', 'public', 'press', 'personal', 'entertainment', 'narcissistic', 'wonderment', 'cannibalism', 'self-gratification', '7', 'sudden', 'physical', 'disintegration', 'Whitechapel', 'murders', 'stop', '8', 'knowledge', 'own', 'imminent', 'death', '9', 'signature', 'close', 'text', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'Additionally', 'gross', 'injustices', 'young', 'American', 'wife', 'diarist', 'death', 'create', 'weighty', 'questions', 'most', 'likely', 'answers', 'questions', 'also', 'indicate', 'diarist', 'Whitechapel', 'murderer', 'Ignoring', 'conspiratorial', 'larger', 'social', 'issues', 'questions', 'raise', 'one', 'lighter', 'question', 'persists', 'What', 'Doctor', 'Fuller', 'Was', 'hypnotist', 'drug', 'counselor', 'diagnostic', 'incompetent', 'early', 'psychologist', 'genius', 'answer', 'diarist', 'second', 'consultation', 'Doctor', 'Fuller', 'Whitechapel', 'murders', 'stopped', 'diary', 'madly-mixed', 'shrieks', 'doggerel', 'are', 'replaced', 'type', 'seductive', 'requests', 'compassion', 'one', 'would', 'conventionally', 'expect', 'actor', 'leaving', 'dramatic', 'stage', 'What', 'did', 'Doctor', 'Fuller', 'say', 'brought', 'serial', 'killer', 'senses', 'Learning', 'answer', 'would', 'benefit', 'medical', 'professionals', 'police', 'departments', 'world', 'many', 'fields', 'study', 'refreshingly', 'well-researched', 'investigative', 'documentary', 'recommended']",The Diary of Jack the Ripper
