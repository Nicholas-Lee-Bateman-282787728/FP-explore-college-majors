I found it.I own a lot of British comedies and I have been looking for Desmond's for many years now.Besides 'Chef'; Desmond's is the only comedy that I know of from Britian with the majority of cast members who are of African descent.BET showed many episodes during the 1990s. I was surprised that it was not shown anywhere else.,5,Brnman,1206144000,"03 22, 2008",2008,339,"['Finally', 'found', 'it.I', 'own', 'lot', 'British', 'comedies', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'Desmond', 'many', 'years', ""'Chef"", 'Desmond', 'only', 'comedy', 'know', 'Britian', 'majority', 'cast', 'members', 'who', 'are', 'African', 'descent.BET', 'showed', 'many', 'episodes', '1990s', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', 'not', 'shown', 'anywhere', 'else']",Desmond's: The Complete First and Second Series

This series takes place in a barber shop , with Desmond (Norman Beaton--he appeared the Cosby Show) and  his wife Shirley, played by Carmen Munroe. Together with their 3 children and the barber-shop regulars Matthew and Porkpie, you never knew what was going to happen next.It was hilarious,up-beat and great comedy.

I saw this on television in the mid 80's and I was hooked I have never seen a non-American show that had me hooked so fast this show will have you in stitches the father Desmond is so funny the mom is a sweetheart the sensible one and aunty susu is a riot. The cast is the best ever they all fit perfectly you really believe them as a family,the older brother is such a cutie the show has a Sanford and son feel with a family matters vibe and comedic flow of the show Martin.
