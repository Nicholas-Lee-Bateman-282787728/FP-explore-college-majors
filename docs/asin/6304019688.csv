I am afraid that people take this material seriously and seeing it &quot;acted out&quot; in this movie may be a bad thing in that respect.  In general, I  have read interviews with the book's author and she said that it wasn't  meant to be literally interpreted.  The things done were more symbolic, the  enslavement emotionally, etc., rather than literally doing the things the  book describes.  Very likely if you did what was done to O to a real woman,  she would die.  Certainly be hospitalized at the least.  I mean branding,  sex with animals, bull whipping, etc.  Come on!

396434,A20IIR0422G3A5,6304019688,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[8, 9]","`The Story of O' directed by Just Jaeckin and `The Image' directed by Radley Metzger are both based on famous and critically well received French erotic novels written, I believe, in the 1960s by Pauline Reage (a pseudonym) and Jean de Berg respectively. In turn, the two movies are both considered masterpieces of erotic moviemaking. Yet the latter is clearly better than the former, in spite of the fact that the two books are, to my mind, roughly equal in quality. I may even believe that `The Story of O' is superior as a novel to de Berg's fiction.While both are of a very high quality, they approach roughly the same subject in very different ways. In `The Story of  O', everything is seen and told through the eyes of the submissive, `O'. In `The Image', everything is seen through the eyes of the bystander become dominant, Jean. That does not mean that `O' can tell us nothing of the dominant psychology or `Image' tell us nothing of the submissive psychology. In fact, it is one of the strengths of `The Image' that it probably tells us more about true psychological submissiveness than the movie, `O'.The primary problem with `The Story of O' film is that while its source is certainly a very well constructed fantasy, the director does not hide this fact and play it as reality. This may be comparable to our not taking the confrontation between Gandalf and the Balrog at the bridge in the mines of Moria (in `Lord of the Rings') because we know this is all a fantasy. The power of great fantasies is that they allow us to totally suspend disbelief for the course of the experience. In Jaeckin's commentary, he states over and over that this is all a fantasy and was intended as such by author, Reage. But, one of Reage's great skills was to minimize the improbable aspects of the story to sustain the sense that this plot is actually being played out by real people.The second problem for me with `The Story of O' is the fact that it did not improve on my imagination while I was reading the book. Going back to that other fantasy, `Lord of the Rings', one of its great successes is the fact that at every turn, it improved on the constructs of my imagination. The black riders, the Uruk-hai, and Shelob were all far scarier than what I read, and the reading was pretty scary. At but one scene does the film outdo my imagination.The third problem, which the movie shares with the book, is the improbability of a woman's so easily moving her affection from one dominant to the next. The book's original ending makes great use of the chasm this reliance on a master opens at the submissive's feet. The movie squanders the great original ending in a muddle of alternatives.`The Image' easily sidesteps the last problem by being a very simple `menage a trois'. And, while the submissive is asked to perform with outsider, Jean, she is always devoted primarily to dominant Claire. As far as improving on my imagination, I will only say that from what you think you are seeing on the screen, director Metzger is pulling no punches and Mary Mendum playing the submissive is about as convincing as I can imagine in her role, in comparison to `O''s actress, Corinne Clery, who sometimes seems to be simply working through the boredom in some scenes.Part of the reality of `The Image' is based on the immediacy of all the settings. Like some films by Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese, where New York City is almost as much a character in the movie as the actors on the screen, several locations in Paris are important contributors to the lush, overripe feel of the film. In contrast, `The Story of O' could have as easily been filmed in Quebec or Sidney, and no one would have noticed the difference.On the other hand, while the two films are of roughly the same lengths, `The Image' spends a lot more time conveying the relationship by showing its fruits rather than by talking about it.Both movies are easily 1000% better than any other movie on these subjects, but `The Image' is clearly the better of the two in a very small field.",4,"Very, very good, but not the best.

Most of the acting is adequate, and surprisingly effective. The plot in some places was boring, but the psychological aspects of the characters and the locations are stunning. It really a movie you can think about afterwards and besides that its erotic. The atmosphere is very intense and the nude scenes have a great photography. Bondage and torture of naked women surely was a bit too hard in people's stomach back in 1975 and it was banned in several countries. This film makes you wonder if such woman as O could really exist.This is a film which many will watch for its curiosity value, but which will probably only appeals to a very small number. Although there is plenty of nudity there are no shots showing either male or female genitals, and no attempt is made to dwell on any of the violence just for titillation. Overall it probably deserves a reasonably high rating; unfortunately I cannot give it this. I am amazed at how accurately the scenes depicted in the film follow the written descriptions in the novel - it is obvious that its makers took a great deal of trouble to ensure this. My basic concern is that this disguises the fact the film completely reverses the message which the original novel appears to have been intended to convey. There were two different endings to the book which are still extant. Both involve Sir Stephen losing all interest in 'O' after he has completed humiliating her in every way he can.I will recommend this film again for those who are curious to watch this unusual entertainment at the best of times.

This thing is more than 1 1/2 hours long. It didn't, if anything it got worse. The acting in this movie makes porn stars seem intelligent. It is mainly about sadomasticism. That is what I felt like I was being put through watching this thing. The main character is a naive woman who is ""owned"" by a man who puts her into some cult where men can do whatever they want to the women staying there including beating them with a whip whenever they want to. The nudity was actually plain annoying. There was nothing in this movie to get excited about or make you want to go reinact any of the scenes. Thats just the first hour of the movie. She then goes to belonging to this first guys brother, which doesn't make sense either, so that means she is owned by 2 men. Basically the whole movie is about torture and sex.

Although she voluntarily agreed to the training and is free to leave anytime she wants, O is defiant and, as a result, is whipped nightly as punishment. After completing her training, she joins seven other &#34;slaves&#34; who must submit to the sexual whims of any member of the club, at anytime, anywhere. She wears a ring and necklace, which identify her as one of the club's slaves. O originally &#34;belongs&#34; to Rene, but he quickly gives her to his older brother, Sir Stephen, who at first treats O as property, not thinking twice about humiliating her in front of other club members, but they eventually fall in love, Sir Stephen convinces O to prove her love for him by submitting to additional training, which involves more simulated whipping, piercings and brandings, after which they live happily everafter.O is naked as often as she is clothed. There is as much sex as there is whipping. Both are simulated, but stimulating. Strangely, the men are fully clothed in all the sex scenes, except one. Apparently men in France in the 1970's didn't bother disrobing to have sex. All the women in the movie are beautiful and sexy; most of the men are middle-aged. Every scene is well lit and there is no blood. For optimal viewing, I recommend watching the sex scenes in French since the English dubbed version doesn't capture the true emotions of the actors.The movie never explains why O, an educated, successful fashion photographer, would submit herself to such treatment other than to say she loves Rene and loves Sir Stephen. It also fails to adequately explain what she gets in return for allowing herself to be raped, tortured and humiliated at will. The moral of the movie seems to be women need to be subservient to men if they want to find true happiness.

In other words, Jaeckin could probably have retired after that one film and left the world an enduring legacy. But some folks just can't leave well enough alone, and so Jeckin set out, with all the hubris in the world, to make the definitive softcore version of what is, quite possibly, the most famous erotic novel of all time, &lt;em>Histoire d'O&lt;/em>. Published in 1954 by ""Pauline Reage"" (a pen name, we have since learned, for feisty French intellectual Dominique Aury), the novel ignited controversy well beyond its rather modest artistry, and in the decades between book and adaptation, it sold in vast quantities. How could this possibly go wrong, when pretty much everyone who's going to be going to see your movie has already read the book, and when, let's face it, it's impossible to make a softcore version of the material anyway? The outcome of this should be obvious; whom the gods would destroy, they first fill with hubris.Plot: a woman known only as O (&lt;em>Moonraker&lt;/em>'s Corinne Clery) is dating Rene (&lt;em>Suspiria&lt;/em>'s Udo Kier). As we open, they're in a car, being driven to a country mansion. We soon find it is a school of sorts, where women are taught submission through long session of S&M; and an inability to say no to any of the school's masters who would have them. After she is well-trained enough, Rene reclaims her and, seemingly on a whim, hands her over to his half-brother, Sir Stephen (&lt;em>The Wooden Horse&lt;/em>'s Anthony Steel), ay which point, not surprising to anyone but Rene, a love triangle develops. Ain't life grand.The movie fails on just about every count; the sex is un-sexy, the S&M; is so badly-filmed that, as has been pointed out in almost every review, O spends hours being flogged and yet never has a mark on her, and the action stops every few minutes for what are, essentially, lectures to the audience on Sadean philosophy. I'm sure someone, somewhere, knows of a reason to watch this movie, but I can't come up with one other than that Clery and Kier were both destined for much bigger things. * ",2,A joke.,1307664000,"06 10, 2011",2011,2433,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Story', 'O', 'lt', '>', 'Just', 'Jaeckin', '1975', 'French', 'softcore', 'director', 'Just', 'Jaeckin', 'made', 'name', 'made', 'history', 'most', 'successful', 'softcore', 'film', 'time', '1974', 'lt', '>', 'Emmanuelle', 'lt', '>', 'launched', 'massive', 'franchise', 'brought', 'small', 'semblance', 'artistry', 'softcore', 'filmmaking', 'many', 'ways', 'legitimized', 'genre', 'other', 'words', 'Jaeckin', 'could', 'probably', 'have', 'retired', 'one', 'film', 'left', 'world', 'enduring', 'legacy', 'folks', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'well', 'enough', 'alone', 'so', 'Jeckin', 'set', 'out', 'hubris', 'world', 'make', 'definitive', 'softcore', 'version', 'what', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'famous', 'erotic', 'novel', 'time', 'lt', '>', 'Histoire', 'd', 'O', 'lt', '>', 'Published', '1954', 'Pauline', 'Reage', 'pen', 'name', 'have', 'learned', 'feisty', 'French', 'intellectual', 'Dominique', 'Aury', 'novel', 'ignited', 'controversy', 'well', 'rather', 'modest', 'artistry', 'decades', 'book', 'adaptation', 'sold', 'vast', 'quantities', 'How', 'could', 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong', 'when', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'who', 'going', 'be', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'already', 'read', 'book', 'when', 'let', 'face', 'impossible', 'make', 'softcore', 'version', 'material', 'anyway', 'outcome', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'whom', 'gods', 'would', 'destroy', 'first', 'fill', 'hubris.Plot', 'woman', 'known', 'only', 'O', 'lt', '>', 'Moonraker', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Corinne', 'Clery', 'dating', 'Rene', 'lt', '>', 'Suspiria', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Udo', 'Kier', 'open', ""'re"", 'car', 'being', 'driven', 'country', 'mansion', 'soon', 'find', 'school', 'sorts', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'taught', 'submission', 'long', 'session', 'S', 'M', 'inability', 'say', 'school', 'masters', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'well-trained', 'enough', 'Rene', 'seemingly', 'whim', 'half-brother', 'Sir', 'Stephen', 'lt', '>', 'Wooden', 'Horse', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Anthony', 'Steel', 'ay', 'point', 'not', 'surprising', 'anyone', 'Rene', 'love', 'triangle', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'life', 'grand.The', 'movie', 'just', 'count', 'sex', 'un-sexy', 'S', 'M', 'so', 'badly-filmed', 'that', 'been', 'pointed', 'out', 'almost', 'review', 'O', 'hours', 'being', 'flogged', 'yet', 'never', 'mark', 'action', 'few', 'minutes', 'what', 'are', 'essentially', 'audience', 'Sadean', 'philosophy', ""'m"", 'sure', 'someone', 'somewhere', 'knows', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'one', 'other', 'Clery', 'Kier', 'were', 'destined', 'much', 'bigger', 'things', '*']",The Story of O VHS

I would highly recommend this for couples, as it clearly shows the plot for both genders to enjoy.",5,Story of O is riveting!,1331164800,"03 8, 2012",2012,719,"['Story', 'OThis', 'true', 'erotica', 'not', 'normal', 'crude', 'run', 'mill', 'erotica', 'however', 'can', 'tell', 'French', 'wrote', 'tale', 'real', 'resemblence', 'American', 'Porn', 'Rather', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'search', 'true', 'love', 'what', 'will', 'endure', 'find', 'Having', 'read', 'book', 'found', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'vary', 'script', 'lot', 'adaptation', 'film', 'then', 'DVD', 'was', 'six', 'star', 'rating', 'movie', ""'d"", 'give', 'seven', ""'re"", 'American', 'style', 'porn', ""n't"", 'movie', ""'re"", 'fan', 'true', 'erotica', ""'ll"", 'treasure', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'couples', 'clearly', 'plot', 'genders', 'enjoy']",The Story of O VHS

Slow, meaningless, boring dialogues in what seems to be a lack of a proper storyline... in the end, I almost dozed off watching it. I wish I'd been able to figure out what sort of self-discovery or personal voyage the main character was experiencing...  but this movie tells me nothing. Someone mentioned something about the good musical score of this movie... I like punk and rock music but the music in the movie just didn't cut it for me. Perhaps the sex scenes or some great acting could compensate for this boring movie but they didn't. A complete waste of time.

This movie is a truncated version of the story, with some interesting differences.A movie is a visual presentation, so many details have been added or filled in. In that respect, the movie carries indelible marks of its 1970s origin - bell-bottom side burns, wide ties, and Farrah Fawcett hair for some of the women. Bust implants were mostly unknown in the 70s, so the female figures are more natural and varied than in newer flicks, too. And, this movie comes from the time when ""safe sex"" meant not falling out of bed.In an effort to approach main-stream audiences, many of the book's more repugnant elements have been dropped. Still, here's plenty of eroticism left in numerous synthesexual engagements. The movie's pervasive theme of control, submission, and pain is intact. It will turn many people off - it was never meant to appeal to everyone, and doesn't much appeal to me. The very last scene of the movie is a surprise, though. It's quite unlike the book, and somehow made everything else make a lot more sense.//wiredweird",4,The dark side of attachment,1130025600,"10 23, 2005",2005,1142,"['Reage', 'O', 'best-known', 'SM', 'novels', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'made', 'general', 'awareness', 'movie', 'truncated', 'version', 'story', 'interesting', 'differences.A', 'movie', 'visual', 'presentation', 'so', 'many', 'details', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'filled', 'respect', 'movie', 'indelible', 'marks', '1970s', 'origin', 'bell-bottom', 'side', 'burns', 'wide', 'ties', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'hair', 'women', 'Bust', 'implants', 'were', 'mostly', 'unknown', '70s', 'female', 'figures', 'are', 'more', 'natural', 'varied', 'newer', 'flicks', 'too', 'movie', 'time', 'when', 'safe', 'sex', 'meant', 'not', 'falling', 'bed.In', 'effort', 'approach', 'main-stream', 'audiences', 'many', 'book', 'more', 'repugnant', 'elements', 'have', 'been', 'dropped', 'Still', 'here', 'plenty', 'eroticism', 'left', 'numerous', 'synthesexual', 'engagements', 'movie', 'pervasive', 'theme', 'control', 'submission', 'pain', 'intact', 'will', 'turn', 'many', 'people', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'appeal', 'everyone', ""n't"", 'much', 'appeal', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'movie', 'surprise', 'though', 'quite', 'book', 'somehow', 'made', 'everything', 'else', 'make', 'lot', 'more', 'sense.//wiredweird']",The Story of O VHS
