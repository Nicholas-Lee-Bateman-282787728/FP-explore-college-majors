It obviously does not encompass the entire trilogy, but what it does show is in my view, very entertaining.  One does have to block out the Peter Jackson version to this trilogy, because ther is not much in the way of comparison between the two features.  But for the seventies its not bad.

344646,A2AVV9LV9UXT6F,6302906652,Amazon Customer,"[3, 4]","I saw this movie in 1978 when I was a kid, and just discovering Tolkien and the world of heroic fantasy, and I absolutely LOVED it.  I didn't get to see it again for about ten years, and by then I was a much more critical audience.  I still found it good, but by then I was well able to notice the flaws.Looking at it today, I still like it, but it could have been so much better.  Prior to CGI effects, there simply wouldn't have been any way to bring Tolkien's Middle Earth to the screen in a live action version.  The huge battles, and some of the more fantastic creatures couldn't have been done with the special effects of the time, not very well anyway.  Unfortunately, it has to be said that Bakshi didn't do any better answering some of those same challenges.  The rotoscoped live actors of the battle scenes just don't fit in with the rest of the animation, and are too obviously guys in rubber masks.  The Balrog, as it appears in this film, is also quite obviously just a rotoscoped guy in a very cheesy-looking suit.  Disney animators (whatever else they might have done, for good or ill) would have made the Balrog as spectacular and frightening as one could have wished for.  The only animation that really looks good in this movie is that of the main characters (and even there, Aragorn looks a little too much like an Apache for my taste).But in truth, the problems with this film are mostly of the technical sort.  The voice acting is really quite good, and both the action and the characterization are actually far more faithful to Tolkien's novels than in the Peter Jackson movies.  In the scenes in the Shire, in the Inn in Bree, the Council of Elrond, and all throughout the film, Bakshi used Tolkien's dialogue almost unaltered (parts were edited out to keep the film's run time from being overlong, but what was used is pretty much just as Tolkien wrote it), whereas Peter Jackson and co. rewrote almost every line of dialogue spoken by every character.  Bakshi portrayed Pippin and Merry just as Tolkien had portrayed them: as trusty, stalwart companions, whereas Jackson turned them into a couple of half-witted buffoons played for comic relief, and even a bit of bathroom humor in one scene.  Bakshi made Theoden a valiant warrior king (after being healed by Gandalf), whereas Jackson made him weak-willed and indecisive at Helm's Deep.  Bakshi made Aragorn the hardy, wayworn ranger, fulfilling his destiny just as Tolkien had shown him doing, whereas Jackson portrayed hims as running from his responsibilities until his hand was forced.  Bakshi, in portraying the scenes at the Prancing Pony inn at Bree, the Council of Elrond, Boromir's final battle, and other scenes, played out the action just as it was in the books, whereas Jackson made considerable changes.And Jackson made more and more changes to Tolkien's narrative with each film.  As the great reviews poured in following Jackson's ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", the second and third films showed progressively more tendency on the part of Peter Jackson to put his own stamp on the saga, featuring increasingly severe deviations from the original story in the books.  I don't insist that every novel brought to film be made absolutely 100% faithful to the original story -- indeed, oftentimes that's not possible, as film is a very different medium.  But most of the changes Jackson made were simply not improvements to Tolkien's original story, and there's no reason why the original could not have been filmed closer to the way it was written.  After all, Bakshi did it more than twenty years earlier, and those were the parts of his film that worked the best.  The flaws in the animated version come from elsewhere.So I still appreciate this movie as a partly successful attempt to bring Tolkien's magnificent epic to filmgoing audiences.  Bakshi's faithfulness to the original story is what makes this film watchable.  The animation is very hit-and-miss, and there are legions of things one can see that could have and should have been done better, but fans of J.R.R. Tolkien's work should appreciate what's here for the good that's in it.  Peter Jackson's treatment is far more famous and successful, and deservingly so, by and large, for it is a great work, which I enjoyed immensely.  Nevertheless, there are aspects of the story that Bakshi told better, and viewers ought to recognize that.",4,A pretty good attempt at bringingTolkien to film audiences.,1183680000,"07 6, 2007",2007,4387,"['saw', 'movie', '1978', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'just', 'discovering', 'Tolkien', 'world', 'heroic', 'fantasy', 'absolutely', 'LOVED', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'again', 'about', 'ten', 'years', 'then', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'critical', 'audience', 'still', 'found', 'good', 'then', 'was', 'well', 'able', 'notice', 'flaws.Looking', 'today', 'still', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Prior', 'CGI', 'effects', 'simply', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'way', 'bring', 'Tolkien', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'screen', 'live', 'action', 'version', 'huge', 'battles', 'more', 'fantastic', 'creatures', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'done', 'special', 'effects', 'time', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'anyway', 'Unfortunately', 'be', 'said', 'Bakshi', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'answering', 'same', 'challenges', 'rotoscoped', 'live', 'actors', 'battle', 'scenes', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'rest', 'animation', 'are', 'too', 'obviously', 'guys', 'rubber', 'masks', 'Balrog', 'film', 'also', 'quite', 'obviously', 'just', 'rotoscoped', 'guy', 'very', 'cheesy-looking', 'suit', 'Disney', 'animators', 'else', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'good', 'ill', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Balrog', 'spectacular', 'frightening', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'wished', 'only', 'animation', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'main', 'characters', 'even', 'there', 'Aragorn', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Apache', 'taste', '.But', 'truth', 'problems', 'film', 'are', 'mostly', 'technical', 'sort', 'voice', 'acting', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'action', 'characterization', 'are', 'actually', 'far', 'more', 'faithful', 'Tolkien', 'novels', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'movies', 'scenes', 'Shire', 'Inn', 'Bree', 'Council', 'Elrond', 'film', 'Bakshi', 'used', 'Tolkien', 'dialogue', 'almost', 'unaltered', 'parts', 'were', 'edited', 'out', 'keep', 'film', 'run', 'time', 'being', 'overlong', 'what', 'was', 'used', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'Tolkien', 'wrote', 'whereas', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'co.', 'rewrote', 'almost', 'line', 'dialogue', 'spoken', 'character', 'Bakshi', 'portrayed', 'Pippin', 'Merry', 'just', 'Tolkien', 'had', 'portrayed', 'trusty', 'stalwart', 'companions', 'whereas', 'Jackson', 'turned', 'couple', 'half-witted', 'buffoons', 'played', 'comic', 'relief', 'even', 'bit', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'one', 'scene', 'Bakshi', 'made', 'Theoden', 'valiant', 'warrior', 'king', 'being', 'healed', 'Gandalf', 'whereas', 'Jackson', 'made', 'weak-willed', 'indecisive', 'Helm', 'Deep', 'Bakshi', 'made', 'Aragorn', 'hardy', 'wayworn', 'ranger', 'fulfilling', 'destiny', 'just', 'Tolkien', 'had', 'shown', 'doing', 'Jackson', 'portrayed', 'hims', 'running', 'responsibilities', 'hand', 'was', 'forced', 'Bakshi', 'portraying', 'scenes', 'Prancing', 'Pony', 'inn', 'Bree', 'Council', 'Elrond', 'Boromir', 'final', 'battle', 'other', 'scenes', 'played', 'out', 'action', 'just', 'was', 'books', 'whereas', 'Jackson', 'made', 'considerable', 'changes.And', 'Jackson', 'made', 'more', 'more', 'changes', 'Tolkien', 'narrative', 'film', 'great', 'reviews', 'poured', 'following', 'Jackson', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'second', 'third', 'films', 'showed', 'progressively', 'more', 'tendency', 'part', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'put', 'own', 'stamp', 'saga', 'featuring', 'increasingly', 'severe', 'deviations', 'original', 'story', 'books', 'do', ""n't"", 'insist', 'novel', 'brought', 'film', 'be', 'made', 'absolutely', '100', '%', 'faithful', 'original', 'story', 'indeed', 'not', 'possible', 'film', 'very', 'different', 'medium', 'most', 'changes', 'Jackson', 'made', 'were', 'simply', 'not', 'improvements', 'Tolkien', 'original', 'story', 'reason', 'why', 'original', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'closer', 'way', 'was', 'written', 'Bakshi', 'did', 'more', 'twenty', 'years', 'earlier', 'were', 'parts', 'film', 'worked', 'best', 'flaws', 'animated', 'version', 'come', 'elsewhere.So', 'still', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'partly', 'successful', 'attempt', 'bring', 'Tolkien', 'magnificent', 'epic', 'filmgoing', 'audiences', 'Bakshi', 'faithfulness', 'original', 'story', 'what', 'film', 'watchable', 'animation', 'very', 'hit-and-miss', 'are', 'legions', 'things', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'fans', 'J.R.R', 'Tolkien', 'work', 'should', 'appreciate', 'what', 'here', 'good', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'treatment', 'far', 'more', 'famous', 'successful', 'deservingly', 'so', 'large', 'great', 'work', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'Nevertheless', 'are', 'aspects', 'story', 'Bakshi', 'told', 'better', 'viewers', 'ought', 'recognize']",N/A
344647,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,6302906652,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[2, 4]","OK let's start by saying that this is NO comparison to the fantastic recent trilogy of movies by Peter Jackson, and it is animated (I'll come back to that) but it is still a good movie. Considering the year of production for a second, director Ralph Bakshi had a vision, and the same kind of idea as Jackson, but without the backing, the money, or the technology to carry it off. The film follows the book very closely, and those having watched the new movies will see and hear identical scenes in this version, lifted straight from Tolkeins pages. The idea was to make TWO movies (but not simultaneously) which means this is a little muddled in mixing books 1&2, made with the obvious expectation of a sequel.The animation is mixed with a process called rotoscoping (traced over live action integrated into cell animation)in a surreal fashion in places which adds much in the way of atmosphere, and certainly makes the dark armies appear more menacing. This idea of animation was more than a little groundbreaking at the time, even though it was done chiefly to save money, and annoyed more than a few puritans in the business. Sadly this movie went down like a lead parachute at the box office, and with it went Bakshi's backing for the second film, and knowing this means you are expecting an anti climax of sorts. The DVD has little in the way of extra's, but the budget price certainly makes it worth owning. Repeated viewing does get you inside the directors vision, and obvious love of the material, and one could argue that had this been made 20 years later, Peter Jackson & Co may have been out of work, Enjoy this Cult and Collectible Classic at a great price.",4,Worth a Second Look,1086134400,"06 2, 2004",2004,1670,"['OK', 'let', 'start', 'saying', 'comparison', 'fantastic', 'recent', 'trilogy', 'movies', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'animated', ""'ll"", 'come', 'back', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'Considering', 'year', 'production', 'second', 'director', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'had', 'vision', 'same', 'kind', 'idea', 'Jackson', 'backing', 'money', 'technology', 'carry', 'off', 'film', 'book', 'very', 'closely', 'having', 'watched', 'new', 'movies', 'will', 'see', 'hear', 'identical', 'scenes', 'version', 'lifted', 'straight', 'Tolkeins', 'pages', 'idea', 'was', 'make', 'TWO', 'movies', 'not', 'simultaneously', 'little', 'muddled', 'mixing', 'books', '1', '2', 'made', 'obvious', 'expectation', 'sequel.The', 'animation', 'mixed', 'process', 'called', 'rotoscoping', 'traced', 'live', 'action', 'integrated', 'cell', 'animation', 'surreal', 'fashion', 'places', 'much', 'way', 'atmosphere', 'certainly', 'dark', 'armies', 'appear', 'more', 'menacing', 'idea', 'animation', 'was', 'more', 'little', 'groundbreaking', 'time', 'even', 'was', 'done', 'chiefly', 'save', 'money', 'annoyed', 'more', 'few', 'puritans', 'business', 'Sadly', 'movie', 'went', 'down', 'lead', 'parachute', 'box', 'office', 'went', 'Bakshi', 'backing', 'second', 'film', 'knowing', 'are', 'expecting', 'anti', 'climax', 'sorts', 'DVD', 'little', 'way', 'extra', 'budget', 'price', 'certainly', 'worth', 'owning', 'Repeated', 'viewing', 'get', 'directors', 'vision', 'obvious', 'love', 'material', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'had', 'been', 'made', '20', 'years', 'later', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Co', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'work', 'Enjoy', 'Cult', 'Collectible', 'Classic', 'great', 'price']",N/A

344649,A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P,6302906652,Arch Stanton,"[1, 1]","I have very dull memories of this film from when I was a kid. I feel that the only way I can explain my opinion is a brief history of my connection to the books. Otherwise it's not clear where I'm coming from. I first sawThe Hobbitwhen I was about 8. I was immediately hooked and read all the books. Of course, I was 8 so I had a great deal of trouble remembering what was going on. The fact that Aragorn changed his name three times did not help at all. So while I knew the basics of the story a great many details had eluded me. Upon finishing the books I naturally wanted to see the movie. So the next time my family went to the video store (yes VHS. I'm that old) I immediately chose that film to watch.My memories of it are somewhat fuzzy, which was my reaction at the time as well. I had a hard time following the film even though I'd seen the book. It seemed fragmentary and portions of it were so far from the way I imagined them that they didn't make sense. Being used to the more unique style of the Hobbit I was somewhat disappointed by the more realistic look of the animation. When the film ended right in the middle of the books... well, as you can imagine I was pissed. Although by that point I was bored and confused. My brother (who hadn't read them) was even worse off. So years later when the new films came out I was as excited as I could be.For a while I've been meaning to watch this film again, to see how it compares with my memories of it. I rewatched the Hobbit too, a film that held up a LOT better. So my review is based off of this viewing with bits of my old memories filling in what it feels like for a child watching it. I would like to start with the good things that I didn't remember but there really is something else I have to cover first: the animation. I remember not liking the animation as a child but I had thought it was more a stylistic thing than a quality one. But the animation here is really terrible. I understand that a lot of this is budget related but it's still hard to watch. Large portions of the film are rotoscoped. Worse than that there are large portions which are filmed with actors in terrible costumes and just run through a filter to make them look less real. As a whole the effect is inconsistent and ugly. Just plain ugly. When they actually bother animating them the characters look good. I particularly liked the look of Frodo, a look I remember hating as a child.So, about the characters. Some of them are quite good. But many of them are bad. Really bad. Rather more are unmemorable and generic. I'll deal with the good ones first. As I said, I rather liked Frodo. I felt he captured some aspects better than Elijah Wood, who I also loved. This Frodo spent less of his time looking all teary eyed and was more assertive and a more active participant in his fate. The biggest problem with him is that the animators like making him twitch around like a child, possibly due to his size. Aragorn is also quite good. I know the Nostalgia Critic preferred this Aragorn to the one from the new films, and while I wouldn't go as far as that I can see why. John Hurt is excellent in the role. His Aragorn is more noble and stoic than Viggo Mortenson's and seems less wild, while still embodying the rough and ready ranger. His performance is all the more impressive because he has some really hard lines to deliver. He's probably the only one who is UNDER-animated. Gandalf is quite good as well. He also suffers from mysterious arm spasms every time he talks but his voice is calm and measured. Sometimes he waves around out of sync with what he's saying which is quite weird. I still prefer John Huston's Gandalf from the Hobbit or Ian McKellen's from the new films. Saruman is quite good as well, despite the writers' attempts to destroy him. They call him Arriman to distinguish him from Sauron except when they forget and call him Sarimun which makes it more, not less, confusing. Galadriel is less creepy than Cate Blanchett, which is nice. I think she's the only character I actually like better in this version. Gimli is barely in it but what little you see of him is quite good. For some reason he's as tall as the rest of the men, which is odd to say the least.The bad: Sam is dreadful. Period. He's a crazy, stupid peasant. It's absolutely horrible. He has no dignity whatsoever. Elrond and the elves in general look just like humans. Given that they weren't limited by makeup limitations this is especially perplexing. Treebeard sounds perfect but he looks like a strange kind of turnip. The enemies (except Saruman) are all done poorly. Sauron looks even sillier than he does in the Jackson version with his giant horned helmet. The Dark Riders have all the menace of a cripple in a cloak. First off, they're not black. More a light grey. Second, they jerk around like they're crippled. And then sometimes they just turn into people wearing horned costumes with glowing red eyes. The orcs are always people in costumes who waddle like fat drunks in Halloween costumes. Their only noticeable attribute is their giant fangs. The Balrog looks like a winged lion. It also flys around, which makes me wonder why it lets itself fall into the pit. There is nothing ominous about any of these designs. I don't like Gollum either. He's astonishingly low key and very slow. Not a threat at all. Oddly his animation tends to be better than those of the other characters. Another odd thing which affects all of the characters is that they like to roll their r's a lot for no good r-r-r-rrrrreason!And the mediocre take up most of the cast. There are a lot of characters in the Lord of the Rings. Often times they don't even bother introducing the characters. Merry and Pippin are indistinguishable. And if the creators don't bother why should anyone else care to differentiate them? Bilbo is barely in it at all since it starts with him leaving which gives him no time to make an impression before he leaves. The funniest scene with him in is when he's ""tempted"" by Frodo's ring, by which I mean he has a random seizure while looking at it. The hobbits generally look like little children, which makes me wonder if the animators decided to make them look like children because they're the size of children. Legolas actually looks different from humans in the way no other elves do. His eyes are tilted at a steep angle which makes him look rather etherial and nonhuman. He's also voiced by Anthony Daniels (C-3PO) who sounds even more effeminate than Orlando Bloom's Legolas. Honestly, I don't really like elves anyway so maybe others will like him better. Theoden is... there. That's all I can say about him. Boromir leaves very little impression except that he's a Viking complete with horns and giant beard. Strangely enough he left a bigger impression on me as a kid than he did the second time around. I remember him literally pinned to the tree with arrows but it turns out that it wasn't like that at all. Which is strange because I have such a strong memory of it. As a whole the character designs are more Anglo-Saxon than high medieval, which seems more fitting for the humans than the elves. Tolkien might have liked that better though since he worked a lot on the Anglo-Saxons. Problem is, the Saxons never built anything like the huge cities or vast armies he describes, which makes the world seem small and underpopulated.Going back to the animation, the background plates are terrible. They're under-detailed and hideously colored. The whole film has a strange color scheme in fact. Sometimes it is decent enough but other times it goes into monochromatic mode for no discernible reason. When using live actors especially the background vanishes and is replaced by shades of red or grey. It is all very ugly. The magic tends to be accompanied by crazy sparkles and flashing lights which reminds me why so many '80s fantasy films failed. Saruman actually shoots balls of light at Helm's Deep. It seems to me that when you need to sell something extraordinary you do it by making it seem ordinary, not by adding a lot of flashy lights as if to shout ""Ooh! Magic happening here!."" The music in the film is rather good, even though they almost never use it. Often when they do use it it seems out of place too, as if they felt there should be music so they just stuffed it in.It was a mistake to combine these books into one film. There are a series of climaxes that never match the natural flow of the film. As it gets closer to the end this problem gets worse. The plot leaps forward at a breakneck pace which skips over much essential information to reach the battle of Helm's Deep in time for a final battle before the film ends. As the audience for this film went in expecting to see the whole story played out the ending of the film in the middle of the second book is a massive letdown. That's my main memory of the film and it's still valid. The ending is abrupt and surprising. Plotwise they are rather more loyal to Tolkien than the Peter Jackson films were. Timelinewise there are very few discrepancies to the book. They achieve this by often jumping from one scene to the next with no transition. They actually skip most of the council of Elrond and when they reach Lothlorien they jump right from talking in the forest to Galadriel's hall. But while the timeline is better, the world itself is off. Badly off. From the little details that Jackson & Co did so well to the constant changes to the lore this film changes a lot. While Jackson's film feels like it takes place in Tolkien's universe this movie takes place in some dimly lit and strangely unfocused and primitive world which could never be mistaken for any sort of reality.So that's the movie. There are some good things in it, but they are well hidden. It's not positively bad but it is silly and uninteresting. Anyone interested in seeing this world on film is of course infinitely better off watching the newtrilogy.The Hobbitis an excellent adaptation in a different style, designed for children. I grew up on it so I find most of its flaws nostalgic. AvoidThe Return of the Kinganimation. It's far worse than this one. It's done by the same people who did The Hobbit unfortunately, and their childish style doesn't fit well at all with the more adult subject matter.

344652,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,6302906652,audrey,"[2, 5]","Ralph Bakshi's 1978 vision of the first half of Tolkien's trilogy respects the spirit of the written work.  I saw this when it first came out and was pretty disappointed, so I was curious to watch it again.  I have to say it's not horrible, and there are some interesting foreshadowings here as well.  Some of the scenes are repeated faithfully by Peter Jackson; animation over live action, which works well for the Dark Riders but not so well anywhere else, is Waking Life 25 years early; and the Dark Riders look a lot like Lucas's sand people in A New Hope.  Things are cut.  Lots of things are cut.  But after having a 20-year dry spell between filmmakers taking a crack at Tolkien, you've got to appreciate the attempt.The screenplay is well written and faithful to Tolkien's ideas.  Bakshi wisely drops the songs (The Hobbit really suffers from the dated schmaltzy singing) but the soundtrack is still a weakness here -- a very 70s orchestrated feel, like Peter Gunn with hairy feet.  Animations of the hobbits were a little bit weird-looking but certainly not the worst I've seen.  In general the animation style is heavy and dark, so the elven lands suffer.  John Hurt's voice for Strider doesn't really work for me personally, but William Squire does a nice voice for Gandalf, and the others are fine. This is a fine effort and definitely worth watching for Tolkien or animation fans.Extra features include a few screens of minimal information about Tolkien, the cast &amp; crew, and the races of Middle Earth.The best feature on the disk is the incredible number of available subtitles -- English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Thai and Korean!

Even a big fan like myself might want to view this once and let it go.Obviously, this was a labor of love by a bunch of animation geeks who adored the LOTR books.  And for that they deserve credit.  The animation techniques are interesting, but they are obviously the real purpose of the movie, not the story itself.  Those reviewers who claim this film follows the plot of the book more closely than the Jackson films are obviously on crack (Kidding! Joke!); the amount of character consolidation and plot-dropping is amazing.  And as far as the way the characters are portrayed: The Black Riders as retards?  Gollum as a disdainful British aristocrat?  Sam as a court jester type? Hobbits in general as little children?  Sauroman the White dressed in red? Aragorn in his mini skirt did have nice legs, though...I suspect that the filmmakers originally intended to create a second film, as the ending seems awfully hurried and all the plot lines are dropped; perhaps they suddenly ran out of funding?I remember being confused by this film as a kid.

For all the problems with this version, Bakshi got most of the things right that Jackson screwed up.  The scenery animation in some places gave me the ""feel"" of the books.  Bakshi followed the story in places that Jackson did not.  Examples: The reason why Merry and Pippin were on the quest with Sam and Frodo.  They were fiercely loyal to Frodo and would not let Frodo face the danger alone.  That charm was totally lost in Jackson's re-write of the story. Next, Bakshi had Bilbo at the council of Elrond, Jackson did not.  Stupid choice on Jackson's part.  Perhaps strangest of all, Jackson totally reversed the roles of Gandalf and Aragorn in the debate about going through Moria.  What the **** was Jackson thinking there?  Bakshi's portrayal of Lady Galadriel was more in line with the book than Jackson's perversion of her as an Elf-witch. At least in the battle scenes, Bakshi's version wasn't an extended commercial for LOTR video games. In short, if Bakshi had the money to use that Jackson had, and had made three movies, I am convinced it would have been better and closer to the books than Peter Jackson's alternate Middle Earth universe.

Bakshi tried to do what no one else had ever attempted--he tried to make the LOTR into a movie.  That was nearly impossible in 2001, and it was about 1,000 times worse in 1978.For over 20 years, this was the &quot;definitive&quot; (if it can be called that) movie version of the Lord of the Rings.  Now, Peter Jackson has come along and blown this one halfway to the Misty Mountains.  Despite that fact, this film has some value--the characters are a little better developed, the story is a little more detailed, and it tells the story in a mostly reliable way.  Still, it isn't Tolkien.The animation (whatever it is) is horrid; I'll agree with that.  Legolas looks like a radioactive albino, and the other characters look pretty bad, too.  Still, one fact remains.  If nothing else, this primitive video version of the Lord of the Rings laid the groundwork for Peter Jackson's blockbuster smash.  We should all be grateful for that.See this version--it's well worth it.  If you're a LOTR buff, you'll really enjoy it.

Tolkien what the Italian genius Franco Zeffirelli did for Shakespeare such as in Mel Gibson's ""Hamlet."" (Fascinating images, great music, and careful attention to the intentions of the writer.)However, IT IS NOT FAIR TO COMPARE THIS LATE 70s MOVIE TO PETER JACKSON'S EVENTUAL MASTERPIECE THAT WOULD COME OVER 20 YEARS LATER WITH MORE MONEY AND MORE TECHNOLOGY.I'd rather not go through a plot synopsis. Mainly because if you're on this site, you are probably already familiar with the story.I'll just say it starts off some time after ""The Hobbit"" and covers material from ""Fellowship of the Ring"" to ""The Two Towers.""The animation is good as well as interesting and unique. In some ways I kind of like the animation with less computer resources. John Hurt really was a convincing Aragorn. Anthony Daniels is probably branded as C3PO from ""Star Wars."" But I like him better here as Legolas.One thing I have to say about this film is that it is less Hollywoodish. By that I mean, there is a much lesser body count of Orcs. But the fewer body counts are actually underlined more. (We see blood during the fighting.) And I found Boromir's death in this animated film even more disturbing than in the eventual Peter Jackson film.Another thing I like about this film is that Peter Jackson seemed to go out of his way to make the Orcs ugly and repulsive. In this film, the orcs are more dark and sinister. And interestingly enough, they are more fascinating than repulsive. We almost have a dark liking for them.The one complaint I have is that the film ends a little too quickly in that we don't get to see Saruman's comeuppance at the hands (or should I say the branches) of the Ents.But all in all, it's a good express version of ""Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers"" that made the most of what resources were available in the late 70s.The animation and music are well done.

344661,A1TR0WPC93BEC8,6302906652,"Brendan L. Agnew ""rothwyn""","[8, 14]","Let's get one thing straight. I don't like to brag, but I know my Tolkien. I was read the hobbit before I knew what ""ire"" and ""break of day"" meant, and LOTR followed soon after, at the tender age of six. When I first heard that a movie had been made of my favorite book of all time, I had to see it. Unfortunately, Bakshi didn't know how to handle the material.The problem lies in that this movie tried to be a translation of Tolkien's book, only condensed into two two-hour movies. The first one, The Lord of the Rings, falls flat because of how it is presented, not the story.Fortunately, the story here is intact. Of course there were ample numbers of things that were cut out, but the events play out as written, and the dialogue is straight from the pages. Problem is, all that jazz doesn't matter if you don't know HOW to tell a story. That's the difference between the Peter Jackson version, and the Bakshi version. Jackson knew HOW to tell the story; Bakshi did not.Firstly, the main characters all look ridiculous, even for a cartoon. The hobbits look more like kids than little people, Sam is turned into the immensely stupid comic relief, Legolas, a WOOD ELF (you know, with the whole BLEND IN thing) prances around the whole movie in glaring white, and Boromir, a lord of the most advanced human civilization in Middle-earth, is drawn as A FREAKING VIKING. No. Just NO. Additionally, Bakshi chose to use rotoscoping (tracing over live actors to make them look cartoony) and it looks awful, even compared to the regular animation.There were other things that were changed for unimaginable reasons. Sauruman is changed to Auruman, though some of the characters still use the original name, which is confusing as heck. The blasting fire of Orthanc comes in the form of fire works which strike the Deeping Wall at Helm's Deep. And the Balrog *cringe* FLIES. Only once mind you, when it's NOT hurtling down a black abyss. These things were just jarring and ugly.The one real asset to the movie (and the only reason this review is getting any stars at all) is the voice actors. They all do a wonderful job, but those most notable are John Hurt as Aragorn and Anthony Daniels (yes Star Wars geeks, C-3PO) as Legolas. Really, all the voice work is excellent, and the Tolkien dialogue comes off sounding quite believable when spoken. Again, the story is commendable, but the presentation is rancid.Which boils down to why it is NOT a good idea to go for a complete translation of books when making a movie. Not enough time was spent in how to display the world or its people, and there were some really dumb things Bakshi did to the characters.All in all, if you're a die-hard-dyed-in-the-wool Tolkien geek and want to see ALL things Tolkien, this may be stomochable now that we have a decent version of the LOTR trilogy around.

344666,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,6302906652,Char,"[0, 1]","Looking for a worthwhile movie to give my 7-year-old nephew for Christmas, I considered, but then ruled out Peter Jackson's version of The Lord of the Rings, which I felt would be at too mature a level for a little boy.  I wondered if this earlier, animated version would be suitable for him and would appeal to him.  When I saw that several reviewers out of the more than 300 here on Amazon's site had liked it when they were young boys, and when I saw that some people who'd seen it as adults also felt it was a laudable movie, I ordered it.  I thought that if I viewed it and found it unsuitable for my nephew, I might enjoy it for myself, being a fan of Lord of the Rings.Although I've now viewed it, and I do think it would be a good movie for a child, and so I'm going to give it to my nephew as a gift, I only half liked it for myself.What I really LIKED very much was the Backgrounds and Settings, which I thought were outstandingly beautiful, with very artistic design quality, coloration, and dramatic light-play:  Think of the most beautifully illustrated children's book that you ever enjoyed--or even a beautifully illustrated adult story by certain artists--for instance, something comparable to the illustrations by E. McKnight Kauffer for the Random House version of Green Mansions--and the backdrops of this movie would qualify for that category of excellence.(I would take exception, though, to the opening scene of the movie which portrayed the historical flashbacks that set the story-line, all taking place in silhouette against a plain red background.  That scene became visually boring because it went on far too long.  It was the first thing that caused me to begin to downgrade the movie.)What I DISLIKED about this movie were the Animation and the Characters that were portrayed by this animation.  I found these elements of the film disappointing.  The animation was very unattractive visually, and I felt the animation was done shallowly and too simplistically.  The characters were just caricatures without the depth of characterization that came through in Peter Jackson's dramatization of Tolkien's story.I felt that the characters' voice-characterizations were not very outstanding either.I particularly disliked the silly characterization in this movie of the otherwise very important character who was Sam.Although I wasn't disturbed by the effect of the ""rotoscoping"" technique, which some other viewers found unsuccessful, I was very disturbed by the effect of superimposing the animated action upon the gorgeous artistic backgrounds.  Since I associate the animation technique with cartoons and with Disney re-tellings of more childish fairy tales than was The Lord of the Rings ""myth,"" I perceive animation as having a trivializing effect.  The mixing of the artistic backdrops and the animation technique just struck me as inappropriate.Anyway, great ""sets"" or not, the animation technique turned me off.  I disliked the choice to use it for Tolkien's trilogy such as it eventually developed after incorporating elements of ""The Hobbit,"" originally a children's story for which animation might have been a more appropriate technique, but, overall, I think the animation of ""The Lord of the Rings"" subtracts from the dignity, depth, and magic of Tolkien's written story such as it finally ended up being.  (But, similarly, I've sometimes wondered if Tolkien's story itself didn't also suffer from an inappropriate admixture of children's tale with epic myth, and also from the oddly intermingled worlds of the child-sized, earthy Hobbits and the other more usual-sized, heroic, intermarried human-like and elven creatures of Middle Earth.)About the ""rotoscoping"" technique by which realistic shots of actors were obscured and added into the animation somehow, it occurs to me that I actually found that effect of obscured realism to be attractive when it occurred in this movie.  It looked quite alright superimposed upon the background artistry.  I think it might actually have been a better and more suitable idea to have done the entire movie in the rotoscoped technique rather than the animation.This much-abbreviated version of Tolkien's trilogy, by contrast with Peter Jackson's later lengthy portrayal, contains no romantic themes at all, and it ends with the battle at Helms Deep.",3,Plus and Minus; like and dislike,1322179200,"11 25, 2011",2011,4326,"['Looking', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'give', '7-year-old', 'nephew', 'Christmas', 'considered', 'then', 'ruled', 'out', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'version', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'felt', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'mature', 'level', 'little', 'boy', 'wondered', 'earlier', 'animated', 'version', 'would', 'be', 'suitable', 'would', 'appeal', 'When', 'saw', 'several', 'reviewers', 'more', '300', 'here', 'Amazon', 'site', 'had', 'liked', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'boys', 'when', 'saw', 'people', 'who', ""'d"", 'seen', 'adults', 'also', 'felt', 'was', 'laudable', 'movie', 'ordered', 'thought', 'viewed', 'found', 'unsuitable', 'nephew', 'might', 'enjoy', 'being', 'fan', 'Lord', 'Rings.Although', ""'ve"", 'now', 'viewed', 'do', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'child', 'so', ""'m"", 'going', 'give', 'nephew', 'gift', 'only', 'half', 'liked', 'myself.What', 'really', 'LIKED', 'very', 'much', 'was', 'Backgrounds', 'Settings', 'thought', 'were', 'outstandingly', 'beautiful', 'very', 'artistic', 'design', 'quality', 'coloration', 'dramatic', 'light-play', 'Think', 'most', 'beautifully', 'illustrated', 'children', 'book', 'ever', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'beautifully', 'illustrated', 'adult', 'story', 'certain', 'artists', 'instance', 'something', 'comparable', 'illustrations', 'E.', 'McKnight', 'Kauffer', 'Random', 'House', 'version', 'Green', 'Mansions', 'backdrops', 'movie', 'would', 'qualify', 'category', 'excellence', 'would', 'take', 'exception', 'though', 'opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'historical', 'flashbacks', 'set', 'story-line', 'taking', 'place', 'silhouette', 'plain', 'red', 'background', 'scene', 'became', 'visually', 'boring', 'went', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'was', 'first', 'thing', 'caused', 'begin', 'downgrade', 'movie', 'What', 'DISLIKED', 'movie', 'were', 'Animation', 'Characters', 'were', 'portrayed', 'animation', 'found', 'elements', 'film', 'disappointing', 'animation', 'was', 'very', 'unattractive', 'visually', 'felt', 'animation', 'was', 'done', 'shallowly', 'too', 'simplistically', 'characters', 'were', 'just', 'caricatures', 'depth', 'characterization', 'came', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'dramatization', 'Tolkien', 'story.I', 'felt', 'characters', 'voice-characterizations', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'outstanding', 'either.I', 'particularly', 'disliked', 'silly', 'characterization', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'very', 'important', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'Sam.Although', 'was', ""n't"", 'disturbed', 'effect', 'rotoscoping', 'technique', 'other', 'viewers', 'found', 'unsuccessful', 'was', 'very', 'disturbed', 'effect', 'superimposing', 'animated', 'action', 'gorgeous', 'artistic', 'backgrounds', 'associate', 'animation', 'technique', 'cartoons', 'Disney', 're-tellings', 'more', 'childish', 'fairy', 'tales', 'was', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'myth', 'perceive', 'animation', 'having', 'trivializing', 'effect', 'mixing', 'artistic', 'backdrops', 'animation', 'technique', 'just', 'struck', 'inappropriate.Anyway', 'great', 'sets', 'not', 'animation', 'technique', 'turned', 'off', 'disliked', 'choice', 'use', 'Tolkien', 'trilogy', 'such', 'eventually', 'developed', 'incorporating', 'elements', 'Hobbit', 'originally', 'children', 'story', 'animation', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'appropriate', 'technique', 'overall', 'think', 'animation', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'dignity', 'depth', 'magic', 'Tolkien', 'written', 'story', 'such', 'finally', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'similarly', ""'ve"", 'sometimes', 'wondered', 'Tolkien', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'also', 'suffer', 'inappropriate', 'admixture', 'children', 'tale', 'epic', 'myth', 'also', 'oddly', 'intermingled', 'worlds', 'child-sized', 'earthy', 'Hobbits', 'other', 'more', 'usual-sized', 'heroic', 'intermarried', 'human-like', 'elven', 'creatures', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'rotoscoping', 'technique', 'realistic', 'shots', 'actors', 'were', 'obscured', 'added', 'animation', 'somehow', 'actually', 'found', 'effect', 'obscured', 'realism', 'be', 'attractive', 'when', 'occurred', 'movie', 'looked', 'quite', 'alright', 'superimposed', 'background', 'artistry', 'think', 'might', 'actually', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'more', 'suitable', 'idea', 'have', 'done', 'entire', 'movie', 'rotoscoped', 'technique', 'rather', 'animation.This', 'much-abbreviated', 'version', 'Tolkien', 'trilogy', 'contrast', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'later', 'lengthy', 'portrayal', 'romantic', 'themes', 'battle', 'Helms', 'Deep']",N/A

For one thing, the screenplay is a superb adaptation of roughly the first half of the tale (part II never materialized, thanks to financial difficulties) - it is intelligent and literate, simplifying the plot where necessary but not diluting it too much.  The voice work is outstanding (notably John Hurt as Aragorn and William Squires as Gandalf), and Leonard Rosenman's score ranks among the finest of its era.  I'm sure that Bakshi's decision to capture a fair amount of the action via ""rotoscoping"" (tracing over live-action images) was motivated, at least in part, by financial considerations, but in all honesty I can't see how he could have done some of the big battle scenes otherwise (not much computer animation happening in 1978). In any case, if you view the film with an open mind, you'll find that the technique distracts far less than the hard-liners would have you believe.  For me, anyway, it cannot materially diminish the quality of such a fine adaptation of Tolkien's unforgettable novels.  Of course, Peter Jackson's films are in an entirely different league, but I still regret the fact that Bakshi never got to finish his version of the story.

I was a kid.As a kid, who had never read Tolkien, I found it somewhat entertaining and it left off at a cliffhanger.  It was not until I was older when I realized two things 1)no one had ever done Tolkien before (other than Rankin Bass) and 2)no second part would ever be made.Upon its own merit, it's not terrible. Bakshi who enjoys using rotoscope technology and reused stock animation did an okay, yet annoying job.  The one thing that really takes away from the film (and once again, realized when I got older and read the trilogy) was the character of Samwise Gamgee.  As this character was drawn as a pathetic comic relief character instead of the very brave stout honest character that he turns out to be I am more angered by this portrayal than anything else.Peter Jackson was right to cast Sean Astin in this part where he's entirely believable and stalwart throught the entire trilogy.  I have a hard time picturing Bakshi's Samwise as the same individual that would not only kill Shelob but to also carry Frodo up Mount Doom.Given that Bakshi was the first to attempt this story and the only person before Peter Jackson to tell the story of the Fellowship of the Ring as well as some of The Two Towers, he gets an extra star for his effort.",2,Two stars for the first Tolkien attempt,1196726400,"12 4, 2007",2007,1288,"['remember', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'kid.As', 'kid', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'read', 'Tolkien', 'found', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'left', 'off', 'cliffhanger', 'was', 'not', 'was', 'older', 'when', 'realized', 'two', 'things', '1', 'one', 'had', 'ever', 'done', 'Tolkien', 'other', 'Rankin', 'Bass', '2', 'second', 'part', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'made.Upon', 'own', 'merit', 'not', 'terrible', 'Bakshi', 'who', 'using', 'rotoscope', 'technology', 'reused', 'stock', 'animation', 'did', 'okay', 'yet', 'annoying', 'job', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'away', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'realized', 'when', 'got', 'older', 'read', 'trilogy', 'was', 'character', 'Samwise', 'Gamgee', 'character', 'was', 'drawn', 'pathetic', 'comic', 'relief', 'character', 'instead', 'very', 'brave', 'stout', 'honest', 'character', 'out', 'be', 'am', 'more', 'angered', 'portrayal', 'anything', 'else.Peter', 'Jackson', 'was', 'right', 'cast', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'part', 'where', 'entirely', 'believable', 'stalwart', 'throught', 'entire', 'trilogy', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'picturing', 'Bakshi', 'Samwise', 'same', 'individual', 'would', 'not', 'only', 'kill', 'Shelob', 'also', 'carry', 'Frodo', 'up', 'Mount', 'Doom.Given', 'Bakshi', 'was', 'first', 'attempt', 'story', 'only', 'person', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'tell', 'story', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'as', 'well', 'Two', 'Towers', 'extra', 'star', 'effort']",N/A

At last, you can actually see all the details and can see what the backgrounds look like.The bad news is that this is still an awful movie.This animated Lord of the Rings would be a failure even if it weren't for the abrupt ending (which is not Ralph Bakshi's fault, since he signed on to do a &quot;Part One&quot;, and it was Fantasy Films who decided to market it as the entire story, thus getting everyone enraged when the story seemed to suddenly stop and the credits rolled).  It fails as an adaptation because it pleases neither fans of Tolkien or people unfamiliar with his work.  Fans will hate it (okay, most already do) the script's sloppy retelling of the story and weak character design.  Non-fans won't understand what is going on and consequently won't care.  And both groups will dislike the cost-cutting and often sloppy animation, which seems to be due not so much to budget but to plain carelessness.The rotoscoping technique (drawing over live-action footage) results in very disorienting character movement; the characters gesticulate wildly and seem on the verge of bumping into each other.  Most of the voice talent is misplaced, except maybe for Peter Woodthorpe's excellent Gollum -- he would later play this part in the terrific BBC radio adaptaion, which is available on CD.By the last half of the film, the plot deflates into needless swrodplay, almost as if the filmmakers have given up on the story and decided to just have a lot of fighting.  All the beauty and subtlety of Tolkien's awesome vision evaporates.  For a Tolkien fan like myself, its almost painful.  Newcomers to Tolkien will probably have wandered off in boredom before this point.There are a very few decent parts.  I already mentioned Gollum -- too bad he's not around for very long.  The Nazgul (the Black Riders) are reasonably scary.  Rosenman's score is overwrought but rousing on its own.  And...uh...uh...well I guess that's really it.Thank goodness we're finally getting a serious, full adaptation of the story.  Only Tolkien completists need bother with this DVD.(Oddly enough, &quot;The Return of the King&quot; the TV-movie adaptation of the last third of the novel and made by completely different filmmakers, is far better than Bakshi's film.  It's somewhat childish and simplified, but gets closer to the vision of Tolkien's world and even captures some key moments, such as the Lord of the Nazgul vs. Eowyn, in a satisfying way.)",1,"Even with DVD quality, this film is a disaster",1000166400,"09 11, 2001",2001,2720,"['good', 'news', 'DVD', 'first', 'quality', 'image', 'release', 'Bakshi', 'animated', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'YES', 'IN', 'WIDESCREEN', 'what', 'review', 'tells', 'widescreen', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'page', 'just', 'watched', 'disc', 'indeed', 'letterboxed', 'last', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'details', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'backgrounds', 'look', 'like.The', 'bad', 'news', 'still', 'awful', 'movie.This', 'animated', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'would', 'be', 'failure', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", 'abrupt', 'ending', 'not', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'fault', 'signed', 'do', 'quot', 'Part', 'One', 'quot', 'was', 'Fantasy', 'Films', 'who', 'decided', 'market', 'entire', 'story', 'thus', 'getting', 'everyone', 'enraged', 'when', 'story', 'seemed', 'suddenly', 'stop', 'credits', 'rolled', 'adaptation', 'fans', 'Tolkien', 'people', 'unfamiliar', 'work', 'Fans', 'will', 'hate', 'okay', 'most', 'already', 'do', 'script', 'sloppy', 'retelling', 'story', 'weak', 'character', 'design', 'Non-fans', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'consequently', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'groups', 'will', 'dislike', 'cost-cutting', 'often', 'sloppy', 'animation', 'be', 'due', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'budget', 'plain', 'carelessness.The', 'rotoscoping', 'technique', 'drawing', 'live-action', 'footage', 'results', 'very', 'disorienting', 'character', 'movement', 'characters', 'gesticulate', 'wildly', 'seem', 'verge', 'bumping', 'other', 'Most', 'voice', 'talent', 'misplaced', 'maybe', 'Peter', 'Woodthorpe', 'excellent', 'Gollum', 'would', 'later', 'play', 'part', 'terrific', 'BBC', 'radio', 'adaptaion', 'available', 'CD.By', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'plot', 'needless', 'swrodplay', 'almost', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'story', 'decided', 'just', 'have', 'lot', 'fighting', 'beauty', 'subtlety', 'Tolkien', 'awesome', 'vision', 'evaporates', 'Tolkien', 'fan', 'almost', 'painful', 'Newcomers', 'Tolkien', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'wandered', 'off', 'boredom', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'decent', 'parts', 'already', 'mentioned', 'Gollum', 'too', 'bad', 'not', 'very', 'long', 'Nazgul', 'Black', 'Riders', 'are', 'reasonably', 'scary', 'Rosenman', 'score', 'overwrought', 'rousing', 'own', 'uh', 'uh', 'well', 'guess', 'really', 'it.Thank', 'goodness', ""'re"", 'finally', 'getting', 'serious', 'full', 'adaptation', 'story', 'Only', 'Tolkien', 'completists', 'need', 'bother', 'DVD', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'quot', 'Return', 'King', 'quot', 'TV-movie', 'adaptation', 'last', 'third', 'novel', 'made', 'completely', 'different', 'filmmakers', 'far', 'better', 'Bakshi', 'film', 'somewhat', 'childish', 'simplified', 'closer', 'vision', 'Tolkien', 'world', 'even', 'key', 'moments', 'such', 'Lord', 'Nazgul', 'vs.', 'Eowyn', 'satisfying', 'way']",N/A

The beginning of this movie was a bit more true to the actual story than the new version in theaters, but the new version, while not perfect, was edited for integrity. This version was poorly edited, and the animation just could not rise to the task of showing us Professor Tolkien's world. Also, there was the unnatural break in the story where, instead of stopping at the end of the Fellowship of the Ring, they tried to cram the first half of the Two Towers into this movie as well. This attempted cramming destroyed the chief asset that this version had going for it up until that point: integrity. Everything after Aragorn and those with him started following the Orcs was just too hurried, and were stripped of all the flavor that the Professor had given those aspects of the story. The Orcs, for example, looked like caricatures of Neanderthals from early films of the twentieth century. If they were that stupid, they would not be threats. But the worst part was from the point that Merry and Pippin met Treebeard until the end of the film. It seemed that at that point they realized that they were running out of reel space and so they went to overdrive, and started skipping whole sections of the actual books. Finally, the Battle of Helm's Deep was made into a victory solely because of Gandalf. He actually had very little to do with it, directly.Then nothing is left of the film. The beginning was fairly true, the middle bit less so, and by the end nothing was accurate. The animation simply was not equal to the task, and mixing animation with live action proved to be no solution to the inadequacies of the animation. So the only factors left are the dialogue, and the score.

I will always remember sitting in that cavernous theater, watching the amazing story of Middle-Earth unfold, and just generally being amazed by the lushly colored animation on the gigantic screen. SO.....bear in mind as you read this that I will always have a soft spot in my heart for this much-maligned film.That was over 20 years ago, and I think I've seen this movie once since then, so when it was released on DVD I eagerly snapped it up. So how does it hold up to the childhood memories?Pretty good, actually.The story is basically the same as in the book: The Hobbit Frodo is joined by eight companions in a quest to destroy the evil Ring of Sauron. The characters and locales look pretty much as one would imagine from reading the books. (This movie adapts The Fellowship of the Ring &amp; half of The Two Towers.) I had a problem with Strider and Boromir trudging through feet of snow in nothing but their little dresses, though.....bundle up, guys!The scenery is by turns lush (The Shire), and forbidding (The excellent Mines of Moria sequence). The problems were pretty much all the same: Bakshi's use of &quot;Rotoscoping&quot;, or filming real actors and drawing over them. The rotoscoped portions just don't fit with the rest of the movie, and it can be QUITE jarring to look at. (Check out how all of the Orcs seem to have just 2 kinds of faces.....couldn't they at least have made different masks to film the Orc actors in????) Also troubling (in a very minor way...) was how &quot;Saruman&quot; was pronounced &quot;Aruman&quot; about half the time. People who aren't familiar with the story will find that confusing; people who ARE will find it more and more irritating each time it happens......and it happens A LOT. The film also ends a little too abruptly; I remember being bothered by that as a kid. (It still bothers me!)On the plus side, the DVD looks great; the colors are perfect, and the sound is great. It's too bad there aren't more extras: all there is are a few text features.

Even worse are how the characters look. The Hobbits in here made me burst with excruciating laughter because they looked more like giant oranges with chipmunk teeth. Gandalf and his nemesis Saruman both looked like scrapped Santa Claus cartoon shots and what's up with renaming Saruman, Auruman? Was it to avoid the confusion with the name Sauron? Beats me. Boromir looks like some crazed viking drunk than an actual warrior.So much else completel fails on this animated movie. I really love the books so much because of their rich detail, incredible characters, and imaginative scope of the various languages, races of beings, and much, much more but none of the greatness of the books is present on this animated movie and everything that is great about the books gets badly soiled and reduced to complete dust.Ralph Bakshi really drops the ball on this one and his directing is really sloppy and the movie is literrally cut off at the end where it starts with Bilbo's 111th birthday as usual but ending suddenly with the Battle of Helm's Deep and never going any further.

Of course Peter Jackson's epics have revealed this film's faults in sharp relief, but they are still not worth such scathing remarks. Until recently, I bet a lot of the same people rather enjoyed this interesting film.The rotoscoped animation seems to draw the most invective, but I have personally considered it one of the stronger aspects of the film, setting it apart from the usual run-of-the-mill, mundane ""cartoons"". It's a sort of ""adult"" cartoon. Would these people have rather seen Aragorn look like Fred Flintstone, perhaps?  At the time, the only feasible, economical way to represent a world such as Middle-earth was in the realm of animation, and fortunately for us Bakshi opted not to resort to the animation of Bugs Bunny cartoons. The lifelike movements of the characters, even though they are ""cartoons"", adds an unusual, almost surreal aspect to what we are seeing. When I saw it in the theatre in 1978, I was awestruck, having only seen the usual Saturday morning Hanna-Barbera animation up to that point. I still am in awe of the magnitude of effort that this film's final appearance must have required.Obviously a sequel would have been nice, but we get what we get and I don't see any problems deserving of the damnation that this film has suffered through. It's not perfect--left out plenty of things, ends rather suddenly--but it was a monumental work and I can understand how Bakshi might have reached a point where he said enough is enough.Besides, you gotta love Boromir with the Viking helmet.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Long before Peter Jackson ever got the go-ahead to depict a live-action ""Lord of the Rings"" movie, Ralph Bakshi gave it a fair stab.And by ""stab,"" I mean he made a rotoscoped, animated movie that attempted to encompass half of JRR Tolkien's classic epic. It's a genuine effort with obvious affection, but unfortunately Bakshi misses the mark more often than he hits it -- from the bizarre character designs to random renamings.The movie starts (after some background info) several years after Bilbo Baggins gets a golden Ring of invisibility. At Bilbo's 111st birthday party, he vanishes with intent to leave the Shire -- and Gandalf sees that Bilbo is exhibiting signs of falling under its power. He convinces Bilbo to leave the Ring with Bilbo's young cousin, Frodo, and then leaves.Seventeen years later, Gandalf reappears and tells Frodo that it is the One Ring, and that Frodo now has to leave the Shire (accompanied by his gardener Sam and cousins Merry and Pippin), heading off to the town of Bree and then to Rivendell. Unfortunately, Frodo soon is pursued by the snuffling Black Riders, and accompanied by the mysterious ranger Aragorn. Worst of all, he's being tempted by the Ring -- and it nearly costs him his life.Then he volunteers to take the Ring into the dark land of Mordor to destroy it -- but the Fellowship of the Ring must deal with horrors and terrors along the way. And when they lose two of their company, Frodo sets out into the wilderness with only Sam beside him, while Aragorn, the elf Legolas and the dwarf Gimli set out to free Rohan from the evil Saruman (or ""Aruman,"" depending on what scenes you watch).I'll give Bakshi credit -- he put genuine effort into trying to turn ""The Lord of the Rings"" into a two-part movie. Unfortunately for him, the second part never materialized (the movie clangs to a stop halfway through the second book) and the first one is an awkward, uncertain piece of work that never quite figures out where it's going.And the animation simply doesn't work -- the characters all have exaggerated gestures and shuffling walks, not to mention odd costuming (a Viking? A Roman senator?). The backgrounds tend to look like matte paintings, and the rotoscoping is bizarre-looking and distracting at best.The animation is not the only problem. Bakshi's movie is riddled with very choppy editing (we go straight from Moria to Lothlorien), bizarre script changes (""Saruman"" becomes ""Aruman"") and important details that are left out, or left in with no explanation as to why they are there. Worst of all, he has little idea of what looks absurd -- the bat-winged lion-Balrog with its big fuzzy feet is a legendary example, as well as the virtually crippled Black Riders and turnip-shaped Treebeard.Nor does he succeed with the characters. The mellow young Frodo, skeletal Gollum and ethereal-looking Legolas are well done.

So the second film was never made.  There *was* a &quot;Return of the King&quot; released for TV, but its style of animation is more like &quot;The Hobbit&quot; than this one (I think the same folks were responsible for Hobbit and RotK).  Nonetheless, this animated Lord of the Rings isn't so bad.  Sure, the animation takes some getting used to, especially the combination of traditional animation and roto-scoping (essentially tracing over live-action work).  But I think it works and it gives the goblins an extra dimension of creepiness and realism that would otherwise not be present in animated work.  There are some tremendous battle scenes in the second half, which work quite well thanks to the roto-scoping.I saw the recent Fellowship of the Ring, so I wasn't expecting much from this 20+ year old animated film, but I was quite surprised and happy about it.  In its own way, it captures the spirit of the books just fine.  But alas, I don't think anyone will pay it much heed when the extremely good Fellowship of the Ring is now available on DVD.  However, if you are adventurous, give the animated DVD a spin.

344688,A1GXBMUTVHWHJL,6302906652,Flash,"[3, 3]","I have seen this movie three times. The first time was in 1978, back when I was twelve years old and I had just discovered the LOTR books. I remember being satisfied with this Ralph Bakshi interpretation, although even then I was smart enough to realize that no one could entirely capture Tolkien's world on the big screen. I think this is true as well with Peter Jackson's live-action interpretation of the LOTR. It is by no means perfect either. Nevertheless, both attempts have merit.Here is what I like about Ralph Bakshi's verion:1) It's an amimated film, but it's not cartoonish!! I've never thought Tolkien's characters (outside of maybe the Ents) to come across as cartoon characters. The story itself is much more mature and complex than that. The animation method used in this film is more appropriate to achieving a more serious tone to the story.2) The scenes in Bree were very well done. This is probably my favorite part of the film. It capture the mood and the setting almost exactly as I had envisioned it in the book. I'll also say that the ""history of the ring"" introduction was also handled nicely. (but not as good as Peter Jackson did it) And the scene where the Black Rider tries to sniff out the hobbits in the Shire is adequately creepy.3) Some of the battle scenes looked really good. Yes, the blood animation was a little lame, but take notice of the scene where Boromir is peppered with arrows. The movements are right on and VERY realistic. Unfortunately, not all aspects of the battle animation are that good.4) The musical score is every bit as good as the Peter Jackson trilogy.Here are some things I didn't like:1) Too much of the story gets left out or gets rushed through. The Rivendell scenes are all too brief. Buckland is absent. Of course, there is no Tom Bombadil (that would be difficult to get right in any version). Other parts of the story are not accurate. For example, Legolas doesn't meet the hobbits until Rivendell.2) At times, the battle scenes seem a little bit our of joint with the actual story. For example, the battle at Helm's Deep was a bit confusing. Also, Aragorn seems downright incompetent in battle. He falls down while running and goes down all too easily in a fight. It's truly laughable!3) Part two was never released. It's little hard to watch this movie knowing that at the end you are left hanging, right in the middle of the story.So overall, I really can't go any higher than three stars for this movie. It's a good attempt and certainly a lighter introduction to the LOTR story for kids between 8-12. Take it for what it is. And remember when it was made. It's not great, but it isn't that bad either.",3,"As an amimated interpretation of the LOTR, this isn't all bad.",1271030400,"04 12, 2010",2010,2671,"['have', 'seen', 'movie', 'three', 'times', 'first', 'time', 'was', '1978', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'twelve', 'years', 'old', 'had', 'just', 'discovered', 'LOTR', 'books', 'remember', 'being', 'satisfied', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'interpretation', 'even', 'then', 'was', 'smart', 'enough', 'realize', 'one', 'could', 'entirely', 'capture', 'Tolkien', 'world', 'big', 'screen', 'think', 'true', 'as', 'well', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'live-action', 'interpretation', 'LOTR', 'means', 'perfect', 'Nevertheless', 'attempts', 'have', 'merit.Here', 'what', 'like', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'verion:1', 'amimated', 'film', 'not', 'cartoonish', ""'ve"", 'never', 'thought', 'Tolkien', 'characters', 'maybe', 'Ents', 'come', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'mature', 'complex', 'animation', 'method', 'used', 'film', 'more', 'appropriate', 'achieving', 'more', 'serious', 'tone', 'story.2', 'scenes', 'Bree', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'probably', 'favorite', 'part', 'film', 'capture', 'mood', 'setting', 'almost', 'exactly', 'had', 'envisioned', 'book', ""'ll"", 'also', 'say', 'history', 'ring', 'introduction', 'was', 'also', 'handled', 'nicely', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'did', 'scene', 'where', 'Black', 'Rider', 'sniff', 'out', 'hobbits', 'Shire', 'adequately', 'creepy.3', 'battle', 'scenes', 'looked', 'really', 'good', 'Yes', 'blood', 'animation', 'was', 'little', 'lame', 'take', 'notice', 'scene', 'where', 'Boromir', 'peppered', 'arrows', 'movements', 'are', 'right', 'VERY', 'realistic', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'aspects', 'battle', 'animation', 'are', 'good.4', 'musical', 'score', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'are', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'like:1', 'Too', 'much', 'story', 'left', 'out', 'rushed', 'Rivendell', 'scenes', 'are', 'too', 'brief', 'Buckland', 'absent', 'course', 'Tom', 'Bombadil', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'get', 'right', 'version', 'Other', 'parts', 'story', 'are', 'not', 'accurate', 'example', 'Legolas', ""n't"", 'meet', 'hobbits', 'Rivendell.2', 'times', 'battle', 'seem', 'little', 'bit', 'joint', 'actual', 'story', 'example', 'battle', 'Helm', 'Deep', 'was', 'bit', 'confusing', 'Also', 'Aragorn', 'downright', 'incompetent', 'battle', 'down', 'running', 'down', 'too', 'easily', 'fight', 'truly', 'laughable', '3', 'Part', 'two', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'little', 'hard', 'watch', 'movie', 'knowing', 'end', 'are', 'left', 'hanging', 'right', 'middle', 'story.So', 'overall', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'higher', 'three', 'stars', 'movie', 'good', 'attempt', 'certainly', 'lighter', 'introduction', 'LOTR', 'story', 'kids', '8-12', 'Take', 'what', 'remember', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'not', 'great', ""n't"", 'bad']",N/A

SHORT HISTORY of LOR animation and movie evolvement (in the 1970's).  Hollywood up until Ralph Bakshi couldn't fathom the monumental task in bring this epic to the screen in a 3-4 hour movie.  The cost and locations plus the unique history, races, weapontry etc unimaginable.In 1978 Ralph Bakshi obtained the movie rights of LOR and figured on a limited budget with the cel animation enhanced with ""ROTOSCOPE"" (live action sequences with cel animated tracing and coloring.  Giving us Smooth accurate movement of figures)) he could bring this epic to the big screen.REMEMBER this was 1978 before computers, CGI  this was revolutionary!!!NOTE: 1970's animation was bad and studios were going broke.  Lord of the Rings release inspired the animators to create and be more imaginative.This 1978 Widescreen Classic was shown only in the best theaters, reserved seating only.  Exclusive showings, master programs and LOR memorabilia was being sold.  This movie made alot of money!!!!

For the first time you experience or re-experience that THEATER EXCITEMENT once again in your BLU-RAY Home Theater with Dolby Digital Sound.  WOW!!!! This is fun stuff!!  Note:  I observed, for some reason the Opening Title sequence and credits were not HD quality.  The movie itself is!!!!!The remastered movie is well worth the money alone.  But you get 3 movie copies to watch; a Blu-ray, Standard DVD and a Digital Copy.SPECIAL NOTE:  TO REALLY ENJOY AND APPRECIATE THIS CLASSIC ANIMATED EPIC I SUGGEST YOU WATCH THE SPECIAL FEATURE FIRST, ""FORGING THROUGH THE DARKNESS""!!!!This will let you understand and see the groundbreaking animation and the brilliant mind of Ralph Bakshi.LOR plays for 133 minutes and the rotoscoped animation is quite amazing.  This was a one of a kind movie fantasy and the brilliant screenplay packs the LOR to Helms Deep. This was basically the first half mark. The ending was nicely done so this movie could stand alone.  NOTE: Animators Rankin & Bass did ""The Hobbit""(1977) and ""THE Return of King"" (1980) (completes the Hobbit & LOR Animated story)for TV.SPECIAL FEATURES: A 30 min Featurette ""Forging Through the Darkness: The Ralph Bakshi Vision for The Lord of the Rings""  THIS WAS AN ABSOLUTELY INFORMATIVE STORY TO WATCH.  Made in 2009 so it provides us with new information about Bakshi and LOR.  Basically it explains the entire making of LOR (live action filming, rotoscoping everything!!!)

I remember as a child watching this over 20 years ago and not enjoying it as much as I did The Hobbit (Rankin/Bass), but as an adult I can now appreciate the work put into this epic tale by Bakshi and scorn those newbies who would dare compare the latter version as better as it is irrelevant to compare a cartoon made 20 years ago with the newer technologies available today.The story was gripping and surely the source of much visual inspiration for Peter Jackson.  He surely dolled things up a bit more since the technology is now available, but this original stab at the Rings is worth a watch.

He would film live action, then doodle over it with animation cells.Bakshi film covers the first two books, Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers. A hobbit name Frodo Baggins inherits a strange, magic, gold ring from his uncle Bilbo, when he wears it, it makes him invisible! 17 years after he has possession of the ring an old friend, Gandalf the Gray, a wizard, revels that this seemly simple ring is none other then The One Ring, The Master Ring, forged by the Dark Lord Sauron to tighten his grip on Middle Earth many thousands of years ago. Now Sauron is leering his head and looking for his ring that will make him unstoppable in his conquest. Frodo must flee the Shire and headed for Rivendell, avoiding the Dark Lords agents, the Nazgul, better know as the Ring Wraiths, where the fate of the ring will be decided.Bakshi film, like all his other animated movies, was a box offices failure. The rotoscope method was too jarring for most of the audience, it dark atmosphere made it hard for children to watch.

344698,AFMHBPOOCEK53,6302906652,"hewhoshouldnotbenamed ""hewhoshouldnotbenamed""","[3, 4]","I first saw this film in 1978 when I was 13 years old and I loved it. I was a fan of Tolkien's literature (even though at the time it seemed a bit complex and confusing to me) before I saw the film. After having seen it, Bakshi's The LOTR fueled my imagination of Tolkien's world further by giving me a solid visualisation of it, and a partial rendering of it's story. My love and understanding for Tolkien's work and world has grown considerably over the years as I've matured. I'm 35 years old now and I still love this film when I watch it.I believe that the only valid criticism surrounding this film is criticism that comes from viewers who have read, understood, and are able to retain what they have read of Tolkien's literature (which rules out 75% of the fans of the Peter Jackson mega-budget film(s)), and who had initially seen this film in 1978/1979. Why? Because this film is based upon the most complex mediaeval-fantasy literature ever written, and shouldn't be viewed the same way as Harry Potter or The Chronicles Of Narnia. And because it was a different time back then; films were different, animation was different, special effects were different, perception was different, and culture was different. As well, one needn't read the books to enjoy this film; but one does need to read the books, and retain what one has read to understand and appreciate it.The most common complaints I've heard and read about this film are ones I would like to address. The most frequent complaint registered is that Bakshi edited out far too much of The Fellowship Of The Ring. Well of course he had to, didn't he? He was, after all, combining four books equalling two novels into one film for the cinema--not an easy achievement, especially if you're one who is familiar with the complexity of the books. (The only way to fully achieve a significant translation of Tolkien's The Lord Of The Rings would have to be in the form of a mini-series made for non-commercial television. Anyone interested?) As well, people complain about the film ending only half way through the story of The Lord Of The Rings. What they fail to understand is that another film based on the unfinished parts of The Two Towers and The Return Of The King was to follow. But Bakshi was denied the funds to produce it, so unfortunately nothing materialised. Another complaint is of the animation itself: rotoscoping. Rotoscoping is a technique of filming live actors and then drawing and painting directly over their images on the film to achieve an eerie realism. How can anyone say that the movements are unnatural when they are taken directly from live actors? I'll wager these same critics who say such an ignorant thing think that the computer-generated Cave Troll and Balrog in Jackson's film look and move realistically. Bakshi's animation is marvellous and breathtaking in this film, and he makes use of many creative and innovative techniques--even if they aren't all that pleasing to each individual set of eyes that view it.Bakshi's The Lord Of The Rings follows Tolkien's literature and dialogue with great respect. With a few exceptions, like Merry making the travel with Frodo, Sam, and Pippin across The Shire to Buckleberry, the Hobbits hiding all together in an alcove off the road whilst a Black Rider hovers above them (a scene Jackson stole from Bakshi), and Legolas meeting Aragorn and the Hobbits instead of Glorfindel, Bakshi only edits Tolkien's story and does not make significant changes to it (like Jackson does). Bakshi even throws in a few original things of his own, which add to the overall viewing pleasure.The voice talent in this film is absolutely superb, and is very characteristic to the personas of the people involved.As far as the physical character designs, and with the exception of the Hobbits not having curly hair, as well as the crude design of Aragorn, Bakshi's animated portrayals are right on (or very close to) the mark. I even accept Boromir's Nordic/Viking apparel and appearance as representative of Gondor strength--(after all, Tolkien loved stories about Vikings and had even formed a Viking Club with certain aquaintances and colleagues of his where they would get together in a local pub and read stories about Vikings to one another).Musically, Leonard Rosenman's original score is wonderfully fitting, and the best I've ever heard from him.The film's pacing and editing is actually very good--although does get a bit muddled towards the end, as befits the literature. I think people who may complain about the latter are forgetting that this is an adult fantasy story, and not a child's; and that it wasn't designed directly to appeal to those with a short attention span.Ralph Bakshi's The Lord Of The Rings with all its many faults and mistakes, nevertheless remains the only respectfully definitive work based on Tolkien's story put onto film thus far; much more so than Peter Jackson's dazzling live-action comic book-screenplay version (which, despite my criticism, I also love). Bakshi's The Lord Of The Rings is for the pure of heart fan of Tolkien's literature. Although it may not satisfy your appetite, it will certainly whet it.",4,Truer to Tolkien's literature than Peter Jackson's film(s).,1011657600,"01 22, 2002",2002,5174,"['first', 'saw', 'film',

344701,A19JYLHD94K94D,6302906652,Itamar Katz,"[2, 4]","I haven't seen this movie in a while, so I'm afraid I can't be very specific about details... It did have some interesting points. Ralph Bakshi's attempt at an animated adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's masterpiece was a very ambitious project, so ambitious in fact that it went bankrupt at some point during the production. Therefore, not only does it stop abruptly somewhere around the middle of the second book of the trilogy (with sort of a shade of a hint of a sequel that was never made), the film itself seems less than finished. It seems that some characters were animated while others were filmed, but whether or not it's intentonal is hard to say. The whole thing seems shabbily made and undone, especially the Orcs and the Nazgul. Another problem, of course, is the huge gaps in the plot. Bakshi was in a rush to finish this movie, and he somehow hoped to cram a book and a half in little more than two hours (the new trilogy by Peter Jackson does it in about twice that time.) Far too many important bits were left out (and I don't refer only to Tom Bombadil, which, I think, was lovely in the book but would look silly in a movie.) And of course, the ending, which is completely sudden and out of place. I'm not even sure if Bakshi originally intended to end the film there, or if he even had any idea where he's going to end it.The characters... well, most of them were okay. The hobbits don't look so bad (except for the gay Sam. Did you know that the producers of the new trilogy originally wanted to make Sam a woman so there would be a faminine lead character?) If you're a Tolkien fanatic (like me), watch this movie (though I'm not too sure about buying it. What special features does the DVD version have, anyway?)

Its one of my personal favorite movies and I was excited to have it on something superior to VHS.My excitement only lasted until the ending, which was altered.  Anyone who saw the movie on VHS knows how it originally ends--there is a pause before the credits, in which a narrator says ""so ends the first part of the war of the one ring.""On the previous DVD releases, this narration had been replaced with a new one, which comes much earlier, in which the narrator basically tells us what happens in the remaining parts of the story.  There is still that pre-credits pause, but now it contains dead silence.  Its jarring and out-of-place.When I found out there was a ""Deluxe Remastered Edition,"" I was excited.  Did Warner Bros. FINALLY get it right, and restore the original ending?  Sadly, THEY DID NOT.  The ""Deluxe Remastered Edition"" has the same alteration as all previous releases!Seriously Warner, what is the deal?

By the early 80's I was able to purchase a VHS copy of this (for $80+ - ouch) which I still own and use to make friends and family their own copies since this baby is out of print.  For what he was able to work with I believe that Bakshi did make his swan song - even though it was harshly hounded on by the critics at the time.  I also have the vastly inferior and toned down (no blood) Rakin/Bass versions of The Hobbit and ROTK - and believe me - they do not hold a candle to this. Sure there are parts that don't quite jive with the books but Bakshi is much closer to the mark then 1979's ROTK (orcs are an aberration of elves not a lump with a huge maw and no body - and Casey Kasem's voice in Tolkien - GOD HAVE MERCY!).  Bakshi uses dialog that in many cases is directly from the Fellowship and the 1st half of Two Towers.  The scene with Gandalf &amp; Sauraman of many colors at Orthanc is wonderfull. Moria is exactly how I imagined, and I still get chills when the black riders unveil themselves at Bree (note the half-orc spy conversing at the table with his fellow spies at the prancing pony - very subtle) The animation is top notch (Bakshi has been animating since the 50's) and while some feel the rotoscoping takes away from the feel of authenticity, I personally feel it fits for the orcs and nazgul and is part of Bakshi's style.  This film is now being remastered for a DVD release to coincide with Peter Jackson's trilogy - which I have been anxiously waiting for. I heartily endorse anything by Ralph Bakshi - he is a true master of the craft (what a shame that he retired) and really captures the feel of the era in his films - try Fritz the Cat, Heavy Traffic, Coonskin (a real natural cotton sweater!), Hey Good Lookin', Wizards (why isn't this on DVD yet?), American Pop, and Fire &amp; Ice (another wonderful fantasy film deserving of DVD release).

344714,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,6302906652,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[2, 7]","Long before Peter Jackson's now famous trilogy graced the silver screen, there were several animated adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy, one of which was this production by Ralph Bakshi. Of the three, Bakshi's version is the weakest, and an absolutely disastrous insult to Tolkien fans.The primary problem with this film is that tries to squeeze the first two and-a-half books in the trilogy into a two-hour production; in doing so, it sacrifices a great deal of the depth and complexity that made the original stories so appealing in the first place.  The movie speeds along at a dizzying pace that it never takes as much time to develop the characters as they should.  Even certain sequences which shouldn't be so important are dragged out much too long.More unforgivable is the quality of the animation, which is not only dreadful, but it looks even worse when Bakshi attempts to use ""rotoscoped"" techniques on many of the action scenes. (Such visuals are also out of place with the actual animation, too.)  It looks especially bad during the massive crowd scenes involving ogres, cloaked wraiths, and other denizens of Mordor.  That the character designs are also completely unattractive and the backgrounds lacking in detail and sophistication are also serious detriments to Bakshi's presentation.The resulting movie comes across as a jumbled, confusing mishmash that not only alienates the audience, but even stops before it actually finishes.  Following a confusingly staged and messy battle (Helm's Deep), a voiceover declares the audience that this is the end of the first part of the tale, but does so at a very inappropriate point.  There's no major resolution and the plot is left dangling.To its benefit, this LORD OF THE RINGS does have a powerful score by the late Leonard Rosenman and some decent voice work from actors such as John Hurt as Aragon. However, the aforementioned weaknesses overshadow them by far.Avoid this messy travesty at all costs and stick with Peter Jackson's trilogy--it may not be more ""literal"" in terms of the dialogue (another sole saving grace of the film), but they are miles better.",2,A lesson in how NOT to adapt a respected trilogy.,1270771200,"04 9, 2010",2010,2132,"['Long', 'before', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'now', 'famous', 'trilogy', 'graced', 'silver', 'screen', 'were', 'several', 'animated', 'adaptations', 'J.R.R', 'Tolkien', 'fantasy', 'one', 'was', 'production', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'three', 'Bakshi', 'version', 'weakest', 'absolutely', 'disastrous', 'insult', 'Tolkien', 'fans.The', 'primary', 'problem', 'film', 'tries', 'squeeze', 'first', 'two', 'and-a-half', 'books', 'trilogy', 'two-hour', 'production', 'doing', 'so', 'great', 'deal', 'depth', 'complexity', 'made', 'original', 'stories', 'so', 'appealing', 'first', 'place', 'movie', 'along', 'dizzying', 'pace', 'never', 'much', 'time', 'develop', 'characters', 'should', 'Even', 'certain', 'sequences', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'important', 'are', 'dragged', 'out', 'much', 'too', 'long.More', 'unforgivable', 'quality', 'animation', 'not', 'only', 'dreadful', 'even', 'worse', 'when', 'Bakshi', 'use', 'rotoscoped', 'techniques', 'many', 'action', 'scenes', 'Such', 'visuals', 'are', 'also', 'place', 'actual', 'animation', 'too', 'especially', 'bad', 'massive', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'involving', 'ogres', 'cloaked', 'wraiths', 'other', 'denizens', 'Mordor', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'also', 'completely', 'unattractive', 'backgrounds', 'lacking', 'detail', 'sophistication', 'are', 'also', 'serious', 'detriments', 'Bakshi', 'presentation.The', 'resulting', 'movie', 'across', 'jumbled', 'confusing', 'mishmash', 'not', 'only', 'audience', 'even', 'actually', 'Following', 'confusingly', 'staged', 'messy', 'battle', 'Helm', 'Deep', 'voiceover', 'audience', 'end', 'first', 'part', 'tale', 'so', 'very', 'inappropriate', 'point', 'major', 'resolution', 'plot', 'left', 'dangling.To', 'benefit', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'have', 'powerful', 'score', 'late', 'Leonard', 'Rosenman', 'decent', 'voice', 'work', 'actors', 'such', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Aragon', 'However', 'aforementioned', 'weaknesses', 'overshadow', 'far.Avoid', 'messy', 'travesty', 'costs', 'stick', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'trilogy', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'literal', 'terms', 'dialogue', 'sole', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'are', 'miles', 'better']",N/A

The animation is done very well, and the characters all tend to fit Tolkien's descriptions (with the possible exception of Treebeard).  If you compare to the campy, cheesy, sing-song animated versions of The Hobbit and The Return of the King, you can really appreciate the work that went into this movie.The obvious downside is that the movie spans about half of the trilogy.  I had read that the movie was originally supposed to have been titled, &quot;The Lord of the Rings Part I&quot;, but the studio decided to release it without the &quot;Part I&quot; added on.  This no-doubt ticked off just about EVERYBODY who saw it expecting the whole story in one movie.  Of course, the film did poorly, so the second half was never made.  Another studio eventually made The Return of the King, which leaves a large gap in the overall story between the movies.The movie also has various quirks, such as referring to the character Saruman as &quot;Aruman&quot;, to avoid confusion with Sauron.  At times, they forget and call him Saruman anyway, leaving the viewer even more confused.  And everybody complains that the characters all have 70s hairstyles.But overall the movie overcomes its own shortcomings with some great animation and incredible scenes involving the Black Riders and the Mines of Moria.

Switching back and forth was disconcerting to me.But now having the DVD and watching it back to back with the new version, I was quite surprised.  If you look beyond the animation and pay attention to the story and feeling portrayed, you will find a movie that is truer to Tolkien than the Jackson version.  Both films, old and new, utilize the talents of Christopher Guard.  Jackson apparently needed his experience on this film.In this version, Tolkien's use of song is much more obvious, original dialogue is used, Frodo is more the hero that he was in the books, Gollum is very tortured by his promise and addiction, and Sam comes off properly as the quality servant that he is.While the film is very true to Fellowship, it does make a few allowances in Two Towers, although not as many as the new Jackson version.My advice is to watch both versions, old and new, and pay attention to the story and not the eye candy to determine which one is better and truer.",4,Look Beyond the Animation,1074643200,"01 21, 2004",2004,1150,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'others', 'was', 'thrown', 'off', 'animation', 'style', 'Particularly', 'jarring', 'differences', 'Helm', 'Deep', 'orcs', 'Disneyish', 'main', 'characters', 'Switching', 'back', 'forth', 'was', 'disconcerting', 'me.But', 'now', 'having', 'DVD', 'watching', 'back', 'back', 'new', 'version', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'look', 'animation', 'pay', 'attention', 'story', 'feeling', 'portrayed', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'truer', 'Tolkien', 'Jackson', 'version', 'films', 'old', 'new', 'utilize', 'talents', 'Christopher', 'Guard', 'Jackson', 'apparently', 'needed', 'experience', 'film.In', 'version', 'Tolkien', 'use', 'song', 'much', 'more', 'obvious', 'original', 'dialogue', 'used', 'Frodo', 'more', 'hero', 'was', 'books', 'Gollum', 'very', 'tortured', 'promise', 'addiction', 'Sam', 'off', 'properly', 'quality', 'servant', 'film', 'very', 'true', 'Fellowship', 'make', 'few', 'allowances', 'Two', 'Towers', 'not', 'as', 'many', 'new', 'Jackson', 'version.My', 'advice', 'watch', 'versions', 'old', 'new', 'pay', 'attention', 'story', 'not', 'eye', 'candy', 'determine', 'one', 'better', 'truer']",N/A

Let's be honest here, 1978 was too early for such a subtle blend of animation and real action acting, not to mention a glorious sound track that defines the movie as a classic from beginning to end. We weren't ready for this film in 1978, it was too intellectual, too clever and too much for an audience used to films that didn't go over an hour and a half. Another minus is that it doesn't follow Tolkein's book in the way perhaps it should but it gives a good rendition of the story, and the characters of Frodo, Gandalf, Legolas and Gimli are well represented. I was a bit disappointed by the portrayal of Aragorn but John Hurt's voice certainly made up for that shortfall. The animation is superbly done; the grainy texture that divides the real actors from the animated ones also helps create a sort of three-dimensional setting that makes Middle Earth more believable. Add to this a good dollop of action, humor and romance and you have a wonderful film that really should have been made in the 1990s. Golum for example is wonderfully camp and creepy, and Sam Gamgee bumbles along but shows fortitude and courage in the most surprising places. The Ring Wraiths are quite terrifying, and their high pitched wailing chills your bones, as does the scene where Frodo is caught between the world of the shadows and the world of real people. Balroc and the Orcs are truly terrifying, and Gandalf is magnificent as the only wizard who understands the real danger than the &quot;one ring&quot; represents to all of Middle Earth. The scene-stealer for me is the great Eagle Guyiere lifting Gandalf from the top of the mountain where Saruman the White has imprisoned him. Look out also for the part where Frodo tries to flee to Rivendell, mortally wounded by a Ring Wraith's poisonous sword. There is so much in this film, and it is such a shame that it has been overlooked for so long.

344720,A27VMEB55OY9LS,6302906652,Kathy-W,"[1, 1]","This is a long review, and I will even go so far as to apologize in advance to those of you who have a 1-minute attention span for reading reviews. I won't dwell very long on the faults of this movie because I'm certain others have done a fine job of it, but I will open with a couple of my biggest peeves.I don't know why this galls me so much, but most of the actors insisted on saying ""Aruman"" instead of ""Saruman."" I don't know if this was a weird sound clipping issue, a scripting typo, or a seriously misinformed consultant, but be aware of this if details bother you. There are also some other name mispronunciations (this must be the origin of the idea that people should say ""SORE-aaahn"" instead of Sauron). Also, it seems that Peter Jackson was not the first to modify characters for the ""flight to the ford"" sequence because a rather comical Legolas appears on the road after Frodo is wounded. Having seen both scenes now, I really would rather see Arwen speaking elvish than a large-eyed man who seems to have little sense of urgency for Frodo's recovery.Putting aside the plot details and pacing issues, people should actually consider other aspects of the movie for a moment (among book-to-film adaptations, LOTR fans seem particularly obsessive about accuracy to the books, but there are other things to look at). For one thing, I think it was impressive that a 2+ hour animated film (take note of that word: ANIMATED!) was finished at all. There are few animated movies I am willing to watch more than once, but this is near the top of my very short list.In my mind, the animation artists who worked on this movie - although their styles are rather dated at times - were plenty capable. There's generally a level of detail to facial expressions that even some Disney movies of the day couldn't beat. There are some remarkably subtle movements that make any and every character more lifelike, and this itself is a feat. There are, of course, some silly moments, but I find myself wanting repeat viewings in part because of the animation detail. Of equal note are the matte (background) paintings, which are generally gorgeous.The voice acting is generally marvelous and I can't think of many faults (except that after seeing the Peter Jackson version, the Merry and Pippin here seem too serious and Sam is embarrassingly fatuous and bumbling). The sound quality is about average for a movie of its age (the only 1970s movie I ever liked the sound on was ""The Black Stallion,"" which excels in both sound quality and cinematography).Leonard Rosenman's score strikes me as nothing extraordinary, but capable for an animated feature. The cues are appropriate, as is their timing with the on-screen action. The music even has occasional moments of building greatness, such as the ending at Helm's Deep. The song ""Mithrandir"" in its choral goodness is quite pleasant as well (ignoring the fact that children aren't mentioned in Lorien). However, I'm going to ruffle feathers here and insist that Howard Shore's scores have so much more depth. Listen to Rosenman if you want to learn how to make an adequate old-style cartoon soundtrack; listen to Shore if you want your socks blasted off.To me, the problem with Bakshi's version isn't what it does or doesn't do as much as how very many things it TRIES to do. It looks busy because it IS busy - one thing you can't accuse him of is laziness. We have a mixture of visual styles (standard animation, rotoscoping, and tricks with light and colored smoke ON TOP OF the frames). We have sound effects just this side of being over-the-top. Of course, some of the ""mixed media"" techniques are due to an indignant production company that refused another budget allotment. It almost feels like there just wasn't quite enough time to percolate ideas.This adaptation is, in some ways, grittier than Peter Jackson's. This one, though peppered with some beautiful scenery, lacks the pastoral lushness of its 2001 descendant. There is far less humor in the Bakshi film, although the Bakshi version feels a little more scholarly than Jackson's at times, especially with regards to Gollum (who is brilliantly disgusting most of the time!).Is the Bakshi film flawed? Certainly, but I'm not going to spit in its face. Bakshi was a visionary and a pioneer any way you slice it, and this movie is brimming with evidence of it if you're willing to look past the picky details of the surface. He clearly cared for Tolkien's work or he would not have bothered making a full-length movie about it. Respect your elders! Without this version, Jackson might not have tried at all, or he might have made a spectacular failure. This version does as many things right as it does wrong. If you're interested in the impact of Tolkien's writing on pop culture, have patience for animation, and want to hear some GREAT voice acting, watch this film.",4,Another piece of the cultural puzzle

344725,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,6302906652,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[2, 2]","Ralph Bakshi, who was most well-known in the 1970s as the creator of the X-rated FRITZ THE CAT and HEAVY TRAFFIC went mainstream with THE LORD OF THE RINGS in 1978. Originally slated to be a two film project, Bakshi wanted to name this LORD OF THE RINGS PART I but was overruled by the studio execs. That should have been his first warning that there wouldn't be a PART II.The existing film includes material from ""The Fellowship of The Ring"" and ""The Two Towers."" Bakshi is faithful to Tolkien's work, even more so than Peter Jackson, though a few of his characterizations are off-key, such as Boromir, who is depicted as a Viking warrior.Come the end of LOTR you WILL be asking yourself, ""Where's the third reel?"" The film ends abruptly---really abruptly---disturbingly so. Merry and Pippin are carried off by Treebeard (who looks like a cartoon version of what eventually became Peter Jackson's Treebeard), we are told that Frodo and Sam are entering Mordor, and the Battle of Helm's Deep is won by the Free Peoples. LOTR then slams shut like an iron door.The film is voiced by an all-British cast (including John Hurt as Aragorn), and where it works, it works wonderfully. The traditional animation is smooth and flowing and seamless. Bakshi also decided to use a technique called rotoscoping in which live-action shots are animated in layover. Bakshi at first intended to rotoscope the whole film.The use of rotoscoping was a groundbreaking cinematic development and earned Bakshi's LOTR a place in the history books. As an aside, Peter Jackson also used some rotoscoping in his LOTR, but the advances in technology between 1978 and 2003 mean that Jackson's rotoscoping was flawless. Unfortunately, Bakshi's was not, primarily because of budget constraints, and it sometimes looks rushed, muddy and distracting.  Later critics have attacked Bakshi's work for its flaws, but much of the problem can be laid at the door of studio beancounters.Considering that Bakshi's LOTR cost just over $3,000,000 to make and gated $30,000,000, it is bizarre that the studio did not order up a sequel. Bakshi later disavowed his LOTR. There's a story there that's yet to be told.  Rankin-Bass, who'd previously done an animated THE HOBBIT for television eventually did create an animated made-for-TV THE RETURN OF THE KING calling it the sequel, but it is very different in sense and substance than Bakshi's work, which, despite its shortcomings, is brilliant in spots, and well worth your time, especially if you are a Tolkien fan.",4,The Lord of th,1344124800,"08 5, 2012",2012,2521,"['Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'who', 'was', 'most', 'well-known', '1970s', 'creator', 'X-rated', 'FRITZ', 'THE', 'CAT', 'HEAVY', 'TRAFFIC', 'went', 'mainstream', 'THE', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', '1978', 'Originally', 'slated', 'be', 'two', 'film', 'project', 'Bakshi', 'wanted', 'name', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'PART', 'was', 'overruled', 'studio', 'execs', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'warning', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'PART', 'II.The', 'existing', 'film', 'material', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'Two', 'Towers', 'Bakshi', 'faithful', 'Tolkien', 'work', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'few', 'characterizations', 'are', 'off-key', 'such', 'Boromir', 'who', 'depicted', 'Viking', 'warrior.Come', 'end', 'LOTR', 'WILL', 'be', 'asking', 'Where', 'third', 'reel', 'film', 'abruptly', '-really', 'abruptly', '-disturbingly', 'so', 'Merry', 'Pippin', 'are', 'carried', 'Treebeard', 'who', 'cartoon', 'version', 'what', 'eventually', 'became', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Treebeard', 'are', 'told', 'Frodo', 'Sam', 'are', 'entering', 'Mordor', 'Battle', 'Helm', 'Deep', 'won', 'Free', 'Peoples', 'LOTR', 'then', 'shut', 'iron', 'door.The', 'film', 'voiced', 'all-British', 'cast', 'including', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Aragorn', 'where', 'wonderfully', 'traditional', 'animation', 'smooth', 'flowing', 'seamless', 'Bakshi', 'also', 'decided', 'use', 'technique', 'called', 'rotoscoping', 'live-action', 'shots', 'are', 'animated', 'layover', 'Bakshi', 'first', 'intended', 'rotoscope', 'whole', 'film.The', 'use', 'rotoscoping', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'cinematic', 'development', 'earned', 'Bakshi', 'LOTR', 'place', 'history', 'books', 'aside', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'also', 'used', 'rotoscoping', 'LOTR', 'advances', 'technology', '1978', '2003', 'mean', 'Jackson', 'rotoscoping', 'was', 'flawless', 'Unfortunately', 'Bakshi', 'was', 'not', 'primarily', 'budget', 'constraints', 'sometimes', 'rushed', 'muddy', 'distracting', 'Later', 'critics', 'have', 'attacked', 'Bakshi', 'work', 'flaws', 'much', 'problem', 'can', 'be', 'laid', 'door', 'studio', 'beancounters.Considering', 'Bakshi', 'LOTR', 'cost', 'just', '3,000,000', 'make', 'gated', '30,000,000', 'bizarre', 'studio', 'did', 'not', 'order', 'up', 'sequel', 'Bakshi', 'later', 'disavowed', 'LOTR', 'story', 'yet', 'be', 'told', 'Rankin-Bass', 'who', ""'d"", 'previously', 'done', 'animated', 'THE', 'HOBBIT', 'television', 'eventually', 'did', 'create', 'animated', 'made-for-TV', 'THE', 'RETURN', 'THE', 'KING', 'calling', 'sequel', 'very', 'different', 'sense', 'substance', 'Bakshi', 'work', 'shortcomings', 'brilliant', 'spots', 'well', 'time', 'especially', 'are', 'Tolkien', 'fan']",N/A

344728,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6302906652,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 1]","Ralph Bakshi's &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is one of those flawed but generally absorbing movies whose legacy seems to be that it was better than nothing, and even that point is hotly debated.  I think this may well be the &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot; of our generation, an animated film with a unique visual style that sets it apart from its contemporaries because of the innovative technique of rotoscoping, i.e., filming live actors and lying animation over the top.  Cleary Bakshi was trying to avoid using the same visual style as he had employed for &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; which, ironically, he returned to when he filmed &quot;The Return of the King.&quot;For those few people who do not know, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; adapts the first half of J. R. R. Tolkien's epic tale of the War of the Ring.  Consequently the film ends, rather suddenly, in the middle of &quot;The Two Towers.&quot;  When you remember that each volume of the trilogy consists of two &quot;books,&quot; then Bakshi animated five-sixths of the three books in two different animation styles.The adaptation, written by Peter S. Beagle and Chris Conkling, is an example of ruthless streamlining (then again, this one at least has an Ent).  Watching this is comparable to watching the original film version of &quot;Dune,&quot; where your love of the book fills in the errors and omissions as you go merrily along.  But for the most part this film races along like the Fellowship running through the mines of Moria, so you really have to know the story to keep up.  The standard joke is that this is like the Cliffs Notes version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; but I have to tell you, the little yellow book with the black stripes has much more details than this movie.The rotoscope process really does not bother me all that much.  It was a novel approach to the problems of telling such an epic story told in the dark days before computers made such things a piece of cake.  If Bakshi had been able to experiment with it more on some other film, then he might have been able to do some more creative work on this film.  On the other hand, I have just never been able to get used to Aragorn looking for all the world like a Native American and Samwise Gamgee looking (and acting) so much like a total buffoon.  The movie also suffers from a rather abrupt ending, more appropriate to a serial than a 133-minute film that falsely promises &quot;to be continued...&quot;In the final analysis, I find that there is really nothing to recommend this film beyond its love for the source material.  I know there are those who want to toss Bakshi into the fires of Mount Doom, but he made an effort and whatever fault people want to find with his thinking in making this film, I am never going to be convinced that his heart was not in the right place.  Maybe he should have stuck to the original animation approach; certainly the film would have benefited from John Huston's gravely voiced Gandalf and I always thought he did a nice job in &quot;The Return of the King&quot; with my favorite scene in the trilogy, when Eowyn fights the Lord of the Nazgul.  Then again, just remember what animation was like way back when in the Seventies and put this effort in some historical context.I do not hate this version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; mainly because I was never bitterly disappointed by it, which seems to be the key factor.  I remember how we all discussed the many flaws of the film as we were walking out of the theater, but we were rather happy that at least somebody had tried.  Peter Jackson has made all of this moot, but please note that took several decades before it came to pass.  Maybe the charm I find in this film is entirely residue from the Trilogy itself, but I have to admit it is still there for me.",3,Ralph Bakshi's flawed attempt to bring LOTR to the screen,1038528000,"11 29, 2002",2002,3824,"['Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'quot', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'quot', 'one', 'flawed', 'generally', 'absorbing', 'movies', 'legacy', 'be', 'was', 'better', 'nothing', 'even', 'point', 'hotly', 'debated', 'think', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'quot', 'Gulliver', 'Travels', 'quot', 'generation', 'animated', 'film', 'unique', 'visual', 'style', 'apart', 'contemporaries', 'innovative', 'technique', 'rotoscoping', 'i.e.', 'filming', 'live', 'actors', 'lying', 'animation', 'top', 'Cleary', 'Bakshi', 'was', 'trying', 'avoid', 'using', 'same', 'visual', 'style', 'had', 'employed', 'quot', 'Hobbit', 'quot', 'ironically', 'returned', 'when', 'filmed', 'quot', 'Return', 'King.', 'quot', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'quot', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'quot', 'first', 'half', 'J.', 'R.', 'R.', 'Tolkien', 'epic', 'tale', 'War', 'Ring', 'Consequently', 'film', 'rather', 'suddenly', 'middle', 'quot', 'Two', 'Towers.', 'quot', 'When', 'remember', 'volume', 'trilogy', 'two', 'quot', 'books', 'quot', 'then', 'Bakshi', 'animated', 'five-sixths', 'three', 'books', 'two', 'different', 'animation', 'styles.The', 'adaptation', 'written', 'Peter', 'S.', 'Beagle', 'Chris', 'Conkling', 'example', 'ruthless', 'streamlining', 'then', 'again', 'one', 'least', 'Ent', 'Watching', 'comparable', 'watching', 'original', 'film', 'version', 'quot', 'Dune', 'quot', 'where', 'love', 'book', 'errors', 'omissions', 'go', 'merrily', 'along', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'Fellowship', 'running', 'mines', 'Moria', 'really', 'have', 'know', 'story', 'keep', 'up', 'standard', 'joke', 'Cliffs', 'Notes', 'version', 'quot', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'quot', 'have', 'tell', 'little', 'yellow', 'book', 'black', 'stripes', 'much', 'more', 'details', 'movie.The', 'rotoscope', 'process', 'really', 'not', 'bother', 'much', 'was', 'novel', 'approach', 'problems', 'telling', 'such', 'epic', 'story', 'told', 'dark', 'days', 'computers', 'made', 'such', 'things', 'piece', 'cake', 'Bakshi', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'experiment', 'more', 'other', 'film', 'then', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'more', 'creative', 'work', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'just', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'used', 'Aragorn', 'looking', 'world', 'Native', 'American', 'Samwise', 'Gamgee', 'looking', 'acting', 'so', 'much', 'total', 'buffoon', 'movie', 'also', 'rather', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'more', 'appropriate', 'serial', '133-minute', 'film', 'falsely', 'quot', 'be', 'continued', 'quot', 'final', 'analysis', 'find', 'really', 'nothing', 'recommend', 'film', 'love', 'source', 'material', 'know', 'are', 'who', 'want', 'toss', 'Bakshi', 'fires', 'Mount', 'Doom', 'made', 'effort', 'fault', 'people', 'want', 'find', 'thinking', 'making', 'film', 'am', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'convinced', 'heart', 'was', 'not', 'right', 'place', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'original', 'animation', 'approach', 'certainly', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'John', 'Huston', 'gravely', 'voiced', 'Gandalf', 'always', 'thought', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'quot', 'Return', 'King', 'quot', 'favorite', 'scene', 'trilogy', 'when', 'Eowyn', 'Lord', 'Nazgul', 'Then', 'again', 'just', 'remember', 'what', 'animation', 'was', 'like', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'Seventies', 'put', 'effort', 'historical', 'context.I', 'do', 'not', 'hate', 'version', 'quot', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'quot', 'mainly', 'was', 'never', 'bitterly', 'disappointed', 'be', 'key', 'factor', 'remember', 'how', 'discussed', 'many', 'flaws', 'film', 'were', 'walking', 'theater', 'were', 'rather', 'happy', 'least', 'somebody', 'had', 'tried', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'made', 'moot', 'please', 'note', 'took', 'several', 'decades', 'came', 'pass', 'Maybe', 'charm', 'find', 'film', 'entirely', 'residue', 'Trilogy', 'have', 'admit', 'still']",N/A

The animation is a creative (but unfortunately haphazard) blend of rotoscoping and traditional cel-shading.  Interestingly, I found the rotoscoped Ringwraiths in Bakshi's version much more creepy than the new live-action ones.  That may well just be the result of leftover fear from my childhood viewings :)  The voice-acting is solid and the score is half-decent.It's a rather frustrating watch since it concludes at the Battle of Helm's Deep, roughly covering half of &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and none of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;.  Even more frustrating is the glaring reality that a sequel was never made (I suspect the lukewarm reception this film received cost Bakshi a green-light for his sequel).  As with any adaption, the plot has been changed, but even the live-action version has some pretty frustrating changes (Glorfindel, one of the most powerful elves in Middle Earth and the slayer of a Balrog, replaced by Liv Tyler!?!?).At the end of the day, this is a mediocre film that you will only enjoy if you're not only a big Tolkien fan, but a relatively forgiving one.

Bakshi's failure meant that no one wanted to touch LOTR for decades, not until Jackson took up the challenge. So in that sense, I thank Bakshi for making this movie.But beyond that, I can't recommend this to anyone, Tolkien fan or not.Those who favor the movie cite the fact that much more of Tolkien's dialog is preserved here, and scenes from the book are more accurately depicted here than in Jackson's work. Well and good. But that does not make for a good film.Bakshi had no sense of character or story-telling in making this movie, no sense of how to depict Middle-Earth or its inhabitants. This is clear in how he drew and characterized many of the central characters. Aragorn becomes an Apache Chief; Elves apparently originated in 1973 Southern California; Boromir is a Viking; and Sam is a hand-flapping imbecile who happens to wander around in bushes at night (don't ask). All of the hobbits, in fact, have an annoying habit of flapping their hands around as if they have nothing better to do with them. We don't get any sense of why characters are doing what they're doing - they simply do them because the book says they do.Bakshi also has no sense of story-telling. I think he was hoping that the story would tell itself, simply by lifting Tolkien's words off the page and pasting them onto film. But all Bakshi accomplished was a cut-and-paste version of LOTR, not a coherent story. Things simply happen because the book says they happen - we don't really get a sense of why.Watch it if you must, but don't buy it. Watch it because it will help you appreciate Jackson's trilogy.

My friend Ralph and I would talk about the chapter we were on during soccer practice (&quot;Last night I got to the part where Frodo stabs the cave troll in the foot...&quot;).  When Ralph Bakshi's film came out I was very excited to see it.  I bought a few of the action figures as well as some coloring books and a fotonovel.  I liked the film!  I was in 6th grade, though ...I just got the DVD version of Bakshi's LORD OF THE RINGS and am glad that it is shown in its widescreen ratio.  The film, after all these years, looks good and is entertaining for about an hour.  The second half is dark and hard to follow and incomplete.  Bakshi seemed to concentrate on the battles.  There is a lot of screen time spent on seeing humans confront then kill orcs.  Bakshi pushes the limits of his rotoscoping technique, but in the end it still looks like cheaply costumed extras that have been traced and animated.  The orcs look fake with their rubber faces and burlap-sack clothes. Some of Tolkien's story points are not covered or skipped (i.e. the gifts that Galadriel gives to the Fellowship).The best thing about Bakshi's RINGS movie is the voice casting.  The characters sound like I imagined them to sound.  The character designs are pretty good as well, although Aragorn and Boromir look too &quot;Viking-like&quot; for my tastes.  Bakshi has been fairly true to Tolkien's descriptions, though.It is unfortunate that the film ends with the battle of Helms Deep.  I have read interviews that seem to say that Bakshi ran out of money.  Therefore,the ending isn't really a planned stopping point in the story:  more like Bakshi simply ran out of money and had to stop there.THE LORD OF THE RINGS (Bakshi version) is not a terrible film.  It has some really good moments.  And Bakshi's animation experiments are to be commended.

344741,A2P6PVWZS4NGV0,6302906652,Michael Bulger,"[14, 23]","This production, on the surface at least, should have had a lot going for it.  Prior to the advent of convincing computerized special effects, J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" was an obvious and natural candidate for translation to an animated feature.  The array of talent assembled for it was formidable, especially the voice actors, who represent the one consistent bright spot in the film.  Peter S. Beagle, one of the scriptwriters, was and is a fine fantasy author in his own right with a deep appreciation for Tolkien.  Even Ralph Bakshi, despite the seeming conflict between his counterculture subversiveness and Tolkien's mainstream Christian leanings, wasn't an entirely bad choice as director.  In the end, though, it is rather difficult to convey fully just how awful this animated feature is.But I'll try.  Let's start with the most glaring deficiency:  midway through the production, they ran out of money.  The movie ends abruptly with part of ""The Two Towers"" and all of ""The Return of the King"" left to come.  As anyone who knows the first thing about Tolkien's ""trilogy"" can tell you, it isn't really a trilogy, but a single book split for the sake of convenience into three volumes.  So, everything is left hanging, nothing is resolved, and there is no sequel to turn to or anticipate.Beyond this, the story is, perhaps by necessity, compressed to such a degree that much of what results is incoherent.  I can't imagine that anyone who is not intimately familiar with the book could make any sense of this.  I can't imagine anyone not irrationally enamored of the book having any appreciation for the stilted, awkward dialogue, either.  Despite some fine voice talent, and the hand of Peter S. Beagle, the script is genuinely terrible.  The conventional animation sequences are occasionally interspersed with live-action footage that has been colored over (so-called ""rotoscoping""), which is, to say the least, distracting; to say more, it's genuinely ugly.  Although I can imagine that this technique has its own aficionados, I am not one of them.  The score is equivalent in quality to that of the average 1970s Saturday morning cartoon, mostly consisting of cheap-sounding, staccato horns.It isn't all bad.  The voices are perfect (frankly, I prefer John Hurt's voice to Viggo Mortenson's image as Aragorn), and there are occasional scenes that stick out as particularly effective or genuine-Frodo's reunion with Bilbo at Rivendell, for example.  It is easy to envision a fine comic book (or graphic novel, if you wish to call it that) derived from selected stills of this film.  And for purists, this version is far truer to the book than the newer live-action version directed by Peter Jackson-no blown-up role for Arwen here-although it still leaves a great deal out.  None of these assets come close to canceling out the dreadfulness of the production as a whole, however.  If you're interested in ""The Lord of the Rings,"" read the books, read commentaries on them, even see the Peter Jackson-directed features if you want, but avoid this film.",1,Truly horrible--and practically unintelligible.,1052956800,"05 15, 2003",2003,3078,"['production', 'surface', 'least', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'lot', 'going', 'Prior', 'advent', 'convincing', 'computerized', 'special', 'effects', 'J.R.R', 'Tolkien', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'was', 'obvious', 'natural', 'candidate', 'translation', 'animated', 'feature', 'array', 'talent', 'assembled', 'was', 'formidable', 'especially', 'voice', 'actors', 'who', 'represent', 'one', 'consistent', 'bright', 'spot', 'film', 'Peter', 'S.', 'Beagle', 'one', 'scriptwriters', 'was', 'fine', 'fantasy', 'author', 'own', 'right', 'deep', 'appreciation', 'Tolkien', 'Even', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'seeming', 'conflict', 'counterculture', 'subversiveness', 'Tolkien', 'mainstream', 'Christian', 'leanings', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'bad', 'choice', 'director', 'end', 'rather', 'difficult', 'convey', 'fully', 'just', 'how', 'awful', 'animated', 'feature', 'is.But', ""'ll"", 'try', 'Let', 'start', 'most', 'glaring', 'deficiency', 'midway', 'production', 'ran', 'money', 'movie', 'abruptly', 'part', 'Two', 'Towers', 'Return', 'King', 'left', 'come', 'anyone', 'who', 'first', 'thing', 'Tolkien', 'trilogy', 'can', 'tell', ""n't"", 'really', 'trilogy', 'single', 'book', 'split', 'sake', 'convenience', 'three', 'volumes', 'So', 'everything', 'left', 'hanging', 'nothing', 'resolved', 'sequel', 'turn', 'anticipate.Beyond', 'story', 'perhaps', 'necessity', 'compressed', 'such', 'degree', 'much', 'what', 'results', 'incoherent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'intimately', 'familiar', 'book', 'could', 'make', 'sense', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'not', 'irrationally', 'enamored', 'book', 'having', 'appreciation', 'stilted', 'awkward', 'dialogue', 'either', 'fine', 'voice', 'talent', 'hand', 'Peter', 'S.', 'Beagle', 'script', 'genuinely', 'terrible', 'conventional', 'animation', 'sequences', 'are', 'occasionally', 'interspersed', 'live-action', 'footage', 'been', 'colored', 'so-called', 'rotoscoping', 'say', 'least', 'distracting', 'say', 'more', 'genuinely', 'ugly', 'can', 'imagine', 'technique', 'own', 'aficionados', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'score', 'equivalent', 'quality', 'average', '1970s', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'mostly', 'consisting', 'cheap-sounding', 'staccato', 'horns.It', ""n't"", 'bad', 'voices', 'are', 'perfect', 'frankly', 'prefer', 'John', 'Hurt', 'voice', 'Viggo', 'Mortenson', 'image', 'Aragorn', 'are', 'occasional', 'scenes', 'stick', 'out', 'particularly', 'effective', 'genuine-Frodo', 'reunion', 'Bilbo', 'Rivendell', 'example', 'easy', 'envision', 'fine', 'comic', 'book', 'graphic', 'novel', 'wish', 'call', 'derived', 'selected', 'stills', 'film', 'purists', 'version', 'far', 'truer', 'book', 'newer', 'live-action', 'version', 'directed', 'Peter', 'Jackson-no', 'blown-up', 'role', 'Arwen', 'here-although', 'still', 'great', 'deal', 'None', 'assets', 'come', 'close', 'canceling', 'out', 'dreadfulness', 'production', 'whole', 'however', ""'re"", 'interested', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'read', 'books', 'read', 'commentaries', 'even', 'see', 'Peter', 'Jackson-directed', 'features', 'want', 'avoid', 'film']",N/A

Since seeing the film, i have read the Trilogy, The Hobitt, And some of the follow up books about the history behind the tale.I have tried to get a copy of this film on VHS, but was unable due to it being a deleted video. It was only about six months ago that i finally tracked down a copy. Unfortunatly it was badly worn, it did'nt stop me. Once again i was in or, sucked into the intensity of the story.Any fathers out there, should really show this film to their sons or daughters.

I was spellbound; I couldn't wait to see how all my favorite moments in the books were played out. Hearing all the great dialogue from the book was a real pleasure. I realized how much of it I really missed when I watched the Peter Jackson adaptions. Don't get me wrong, those movies are my all-time favorites, just as the books have always surpassed all others for me; but come on. Don't you miss seeing Frodo actually draw his sword and attempt to stand up to the black riders instead of falling backwards without a fight? And the wonderful humorous moments that lightened the series' mood near the beginning were sadly missing in the Peter Jackson films as well. Then too, some of the most chilling moments in the books, such as the flight to the ford, were really softened in the newer movies. Not so with Bakshi's! The creepy red contrasts and blaring music definitely capture the necessary terror of the black riders' chase. Yet, while the music is good, it does not often tell you how to feel; sometimes I think newer movies are always trying to make you feel a certain way about the characters and happenings, whereas this movie tells you what happens in the story and lets you decide what you think, rather like a book.This movie is not flawless; sometimes a great line from the book is cut short, no doubt for time purposes, but still, I missed it. Thoughts from the book aren't always carried out to their conclusions.Sam seemed a bit too oafish, but everyone imagines things differently when they read a book. I thought Frodo was done very well, and so was Aragorn; in the book he was described as rather rough-looking.I was grossly disappointed when the movie ended part-way through The Two Towers and I learned there was no sequel. I would really have liked to see how Bakshi visualized the rest. Still, this much is definitely worth a watch, despite the disappointment of its ending; it's great to find another way to experience Tolkien's work.",5,Wonderful!,1389312000,"01 10, 2014",2014,2026,"['Watching', 'movie', 'was', 'incredibly', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'was', 'spellbound', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'how', 'favorite', 'moments', 'books', 'were', 'played', 'out', 'Hearing', 'great', 'dialogue', 'book', 'was', 'real', 'pleasure', 'realized', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'missed', 'when', 'watched', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'adaptions', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'movies', 'are', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'just', 'books', 'have', 'always', 'surpassed', 'others', 'come', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'seeing', 'Frodo', 'actually', 'draw', 'sword', 'attempt', 'stand', 'up', 'black', 'riders', 'instead', 'falling', 'backwards', 'fight', 'wonderful', 'humorous', 'moments', 'lightened', 'series', 'mood', 'beginning', 'were', 'sadly', 'missing', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'Then', 'too', 'most', 'chilling', 'moments', 'books', 'such', 'flight', 'ford', 'were', 'really', 'softened', 'newer', 'movies', 'Not', 'so', 'Bakshi', 'creepy', 'red', 'contrasts', 'blaring', 'music', 'definitely', 'capture', 'necessary', 'terror', 'black', 'riders', 'chase', 'music', 'good', 'not', 'often', 'tell', 'how', 'feel', 'sometimes', 'think', 'newer', 'movies', 'are', 'always', 'trying', 'make', 'feel', 'certain', 'way', 'characters', 'happenings', 'movie', 'what', 'story', 'decide', 'what', 'think', 'rather', 'book.This', 'movie', 'not', 'flawless', 'sometimes', 'great', 'line', 'book', 'cut', 'short', 'doubt', 'time', 'purposes', 'still', 'missed', 'Thoughts', 'book', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'carried', 'conclusions.Sam', 'seemed', 'bit', 'too', 'oafish', 'everyone', 'imagines', 'things', 'differently', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'thought', 'Frodo', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'so', 'was', 'Aragorn', 'book', 'was', 'described', 'rather', 'rough-looking.I', 'was', 'grossly', 'disappointed', 'when', 'movie', 'ended', 'part-way', 'Two', 'Towers', 'learned', 'was', 'sequel', 'would', 'really', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'how', 'Bakshi', 'visualized', 'rest', 'Still', 'much', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watch', 'disappointment', 'ending', 'great', 'find', 'way', 'experience', 'Tolkien', 'work']",N/A

Its really a shame that he ran out of money and wasn't allowed to tell this tale in the fashion that Jackson has been, because one thing this version does have is character development. Maybe Sam is portrayed as a buffoon, and Aragorn looks more like a dock worker than a soon to be king, but the actual Tolkien story and its nuances are paid attention to here with the time allowed.I do think this movie is worth a look or two from Tolkien fans or not, because the characters are more full in this version, and a better sense of the book's movement between those characters is given attention. This book is impossible to film, and Jackson has made a great go at it, but there are some missing things that this version does retain. Visually, Jackson's has truly brought the book to life, but on characterisation, there is so much missing. And for the sake of drama, Frodo is seen in Jackson's as far weaker than he is portrayed in the book. I think Bakshi's version pays attention moreso to those personality traits, but that is a harder story to tell.And the Ringwraiths are far scarier and threatening in this version than in Jackson's (Fellowship)Lord of the Rings, but in the scenes it should be noted that Jackson definitely saw this movie and used it as like a storyboard.

Given a choice, I think the newer version is superior by far, but for a movie made in the late 70's, this first attempt was really very good.  The animation was a bit broken, but the main characters were done very well, captured with true intent (except for poor Sam, who was made ugly, but was, in my opinion, the story's true hero in the end).

A fellow LOTR/Tolkien fan friend and I watched this atrocity against Tolkien and were somewhere between shocked/amused and horrified. Why did Bakshi hate Tolkien so much! ;) Ok, so he didn't hate Tolkien, else he would not have made this film. But, while it is true to the book for the majority of the film, it nowhere touches the essence of Tolkien's masterpiece, nor encompasses his spirit, or wit or his depth of writing.The acting was wretched, not helped along by dreadful animation (why???), painful sound effects (boiiiiiing!, the Morgul blade disappears) and an equally grating score (think 70s horror/sci-fi)We both felt that there was too much drama without enough emotion. It was a high-energy, chaotic film without instilling any sense of concern in the audience for the goofy characters. It doesn't seem that with so many animators at their disposal that they really made good use of them. And the horrid live-action layered on top of awful, saturated colors (lots of red) made for laughter, not fear or excitement.Nor does it seem that the writers/actors/director really read the book, as there were SEVERAL (all) pronunciation mistakes from ""Sore-on"" to ""Aruman"", this latter was even SPELLED as ""Aruman"" in the subtitles!I would not recommend this as a family film. You're much better off with Jackson's grand & gorgeous films (with its tally of deviations and embellishments), even for your younger children.

I mean, it doesn't even really end, it just stops.This is unfortunate, because what they began is really quite good.  The animation is excellent.  So is the storytelling (or half of it).  At the time, animation allowed the creators to do things that were unimaginable with computer generated images.  The development and representation of Tolkien's characters is excellent.  The director and animators really create a sense of a dark and dangerous time in Middle Earth - both visually and emotionally.  The journey of the Fellowship really seems hopeless and more than can be accomplished.

It was a real disappointment to me growing up that they didn't, because the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were among my favorite stories.As this is not exactly half of The Lord of the Rings, I can't give it exactly half of five stars (which it would have earned if the whole trilogy was completed).I cannot comment directly on the quality or features of the DVD because I do not and would not own it.To be honest, there is no reason to buy this movie.  This is NOT the complete trilogy!  Unless you are an animation fanatic, or a real fan of the Lord of the Rings and have to have everything related to it, I think you will just be frustrated that the creators drew you into the mystical world or Middle Earth just to be left hanging halfway thr . . .",2,The Lord o . . .,1000684800,"09 17, 2001",2001,1789,"['should', 'have', 'called', 'movie', 'quot', 'Lord', 'o', 'quot', 'almost', 'exactly', 'halfway', 'Tolkien', 'famous', 'trilogy', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'mean', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'end', 'just', 'stops.This', 'unfortunate', 'what', 'began', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'animation', 'excellent', 'storytelling', 'half', 'time', 'animation', 'allowed', 'creators', 'do', 'things', 'were', 'unimaginable', 'computer', 'generated', 'images', 'development', 'representation', 'Tolkien', 'characters', 'excellent', 'director', 'animators', 'really', 'create', 'sense', 'dark', 'dangerous', 'time', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'visually', 'emotionally', 'journey', 'Fellowship', 'really', 'hopeless', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'accomplished', 'Apparently', 'complete', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'more', 'could', 'be', 'accomplished', 'several', 'years', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'actually', 'thought', 'were', 'going', 'come', 'out', 'remainder', 'trilogy', 'could', 'have', 'called', 'quot', 'f', 'Rings', 'quot', 'was', 'real', 'disappointment', 'growing', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'Hobbit', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'were', 'favorite', 'stories.As', 'not', 'exactly', 'half', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'exactly', 'half', 'five', 'stars', 'would', 'have', 'earned', 'whole', 'trilogy', 'was', 'completed', '.I', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'directly', 'quality', 'features', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'would', 'not', 'own', 'it.To', 'be', 'honest', 'reason', 'buy', 'movie', 'NOT', 'complete', 'trilogy', 'are', 'animation', 'fanatic', 'real', 'fan', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'have', 'have', 'everything', 'related', 'think', 'will', 'just', 'be', 'frustrated', 'creators', 'drew', 'mystical', 'world', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'just', 'be', 'left', 'hanging', 'halfway', 'thr']",N/A

344757,A33XZ94NI9WWGS,6302906652,Rachel,"[3, 8]","This film is apparently loved by people who preferred a version closer to the books than Peter Jackson's, as well as Arwen-haters who were furious that someone with boobs dare have her role inflated for a LOTR movie (but who were perfectly fine with all the battle-action added in for the male heroes).  That's pretty much the only positive thing to be said for this movie; it was closer to the books. Assuming that ""closer to the book"" is always, automatically a good thing.Before I go on, I'll establish my credibility here. I've read ""Fellowship"" and ""Two Towers,"" and (mostly) enjoyed them. I've read parts of ""Return of the King"" and plan to read the whole trilogy eventually. And of course I've seen Peter Jackson's trilogy more times than I can count.  I've read ""The Hobbit."" I'm not the most devoted, hardcore fan, but I do like LOTR, a lot. I am also a very hardcore fan of animation, and a big fan of Ralph Bakshi's (the man who made this animated film).And now, for my humble, subjective opinion: this movie sucks.  At times, the suckiness is entertaining. But mostly it's just painful.PLOT:Very close to the books. Oddly, This film deals only with ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers,"" rather than following the book's trilogy model, or cramming them all into one film. Some small changes are made (like having Legolas replace Glorfindel in one scene), but it's far closer to the books than the famous Jackson version.CHARACTERS:Some are very close to the book. Frodo and Aragorn come to mind. Others...aren't. Poor Sam was lobotomized for this movie. And Treebeard was a giant walking carrot with feet--although, this was one of those things that was so dumb it made me laugh. He seemed like he'd fit better in ""The Phantom Tollbooth.""As for the characters who were close to the book, they might've been a bit too close. Jackson's version put twists on the characters. He made Aragorn conflicted about becoming king, fearing that the power would corrupt him like it did his ancestor; Jackson's Frodo was vulnerable, and conflicted about carrying the ring. This movie on the other hand puts no interpretative twist on the characters.  They just march into the quest like it's something they do every day. ""Okay, lets' get this ring thing over with, so I can go home and have a beer already.""Oh, and forget about female characters. Galadriel has a nice cameo, but that's it. Arwen is completely absent. Eowyn is present, but mute. Oh, and Aragorn tells that story to the hobbits, about the elf who gave her immortality up for the man she loved; but with no sight or mention of Arwen, that scene becomes pointless.  On the other hand, knowing Ralph Bakshi, maybe it's better that the women didn't show up; Arwen would probably have some sheer stripperiffic gown that showed her nipples, and Eowyn would fight in a spiraled metal bikini.ANIMATION:Lazy. Horribly, insultingly, appallingly, hilariously, depressingly, maddeningly lazy.The opening scene is so badly done, you'd think it was a comedy that was being cheap on purpose.  We open to a series of silhouettes against a red backdrop.  It's obviously live ""actors"", but I think we're supposed to be fooled into thinking they're just silhouettes of the animated characters we'll meet later. Or maybe it's just another example of Bakshi's experimental style of mixing live action with animation.  You'll see a lot of that in this movie.The live-action returns later on, in the form of rotoscoping...if that's even the right term to describe it. The Black Riders and Orcs seem like live-action footage of people in silly costumes, tinted black, and then poorly spliced over the animated scenes. (The Orcs also have silly Muppet fangs.) The Prancing Pony is filled with live-action peasants, crudely drawn and inked over, looking far too realistic, spliced over the animated backdrop and interacting with the cartoon bartender and hobbits.  Perhaps most hysterical is the Balrog, a live-action man in a black lion/dragon costume, who comes stopping in like something from a `60s Japanese monster flick.The main characters are more traditionally animated, but still rotoscoped. They way they move is very wobbly, and makes me a tad dizzy as I type this, just thinking about it.And finally, the character designs. They're bland and best, and absurd at worst. Okay, I realize that animation was more difficult in 1978, and they couldn't make the characters appearances or clothing too detailed. But they still could've done something...creative. Animated films before this one did better, and Bakshi himself has done better. Nothing about the elves looks magical; they don't look particularly more ""beautiful"" than humans, and don't even have pointed ears. There is a disturbing lack of pants amongst the human and elf male leads. Oh, and Boromir, for some reason, is a goddamn Viking.There are two good things about the animation. One, that the backgrounds are often quite detailed and lovely, often filled with weird faces that remind one of Bakshi's ""Cool World."" Two, there are a few instances of surreal, colorful lights swimming about, just to remind you that this movie is from the '70s.Ralph Bakshi has a very unique way of doing animation. The weird mix of animation and live action does work in his other films (""Cool World,"" ""Coonskin,"" ""Heavy Traffic,"" ""Wizards""), because those movies are supposed to be outrageous. They're half-comedy, half-social commentary. When he tried to do something more mainstream with LOTR though, it didn't work.  At all.ACTING/DIRECTING:Dull. I assume the director is more responsible than the actors, but I'm not interested in throwing blame here. I'm just here to say that this movie isn't very dramatic.Galadriel is never tempted by the ring; instead, her ""In place of a dark lord..."" speech is turned into a sarcastic joke. Boromir comes close to adding drama when he's acting out, but that horned Viking helmet makes it impossible to talk him seriously. I've already mentioned Sam's mental castration, and the rest of the cast's indifference towards their quest.MUSIC:In truth, I don't remember the soundtrack. I was far too distracted by the bizarre and mind-numbing visuals.  BUT, I did hear on an interview with Bakshi, that he originally wanted to play his LOTR film against hippie-rock music. Now THAT might have made for an interesting movie.THE SEQUEL:In case you're a masochist, and want MORE of this turkey, there is a sequel, ""The Return of the King,"" that continues the adventure.  I looked it up out of curiosity, and found that it was released in 1980, on TV only. Yes. Bakshi's film was a legitimate movie, and the sequel wasn't. Which can only mean that ROTK is. Even. Cheaper. I watched the clip on You Tube of Eowyn slaying the Witch King. It was hilarious. He sounded like the Monarch from ""Venture Bros.""THE GOOD BITS:Even a heckler must admit that there are a few good things about this movie. I shall list them:* The Proudfoot hobbit shouting, ""ProudFEET!"" and wiggling his toes, in a funny way.* Treebeard. His appearance and walk are a riot. He will make you nostalgic for ""The Phantom Tollbooth"" and ""Looney Tunes.""* Trippy Disco lights flying out of Saruman's cloak and Galadirel's ring* The Orcs are pretty funny looking. They look like black Muppets, with fangs stolen right from The Count and horns stolen from ""Eureka's Castle.""* Sam's idiocy is often so awful it's funny. ""OOoooo Mr. Frodoooo, I'm drowning!""* Legolas 's derpy cross-eyed face. He looks high 24/7.* Gandalf's drama-queen twirls and bug-eyes are hilarious, and at times remind me of Merlin from Disney's ""The Sword in the Stone.""  (There's a lot in this movie that brings out the kid in you.)THE FINAL LAMENT:There is one thing that makes me horribly sad about Ralph Bakshi doing LOTR. More-so than anything else previously mentioned. It's the fact that he did ""Lord of the Rings,"" and not ""Bored of the Rings."" ""Bored of the Rings"" is an outrageous parody of LOTR, written in 1969 by the Harvard Lampoon. If anyone could pull off that cartoonish, crude, 60s-pop-culture-filled comedy, it's Bakshi. It pains me that he tried to do something serious with LOTR, when he could've done something ingenious with BOTR.  BUT, what movies Bakshi wanted to make are none of my beeswax.",1,Slightly good (as a comedy),1353369600,"11 20, 2012",2012,8289,"['film', 'apparently', 'loved', 'people', 'who', 'preferred',

344758,A1CA1A1MGW0I3J,6302906652,Raisuli the Magnificent,"[0, 2]","When I went and saw this movie during opening weekend, it was standing room only in the brown eggshell that used to be the century theatre architecture.  My friend and I bought tickets, walked in, and there were, quite literally, people standing in the back isled behind the back row of seats, and people standing on the side by the emergency exit to see this thing.  I mean, wow, the movie must be really good for this kind of turnout.Imagine my disappointment when the film was over.  I may be unique in that I was exposed to Tolkien while I was still in first and second grade many years earlier, but even the adults who walked out of that theatre left silent.  After the film was over no one had much to say.The film resembled Tolkien's work in that the main characters were present, the first half of the film was dedicated to ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", and that's about it.  All of the other story elements were gone.  Literally, they were just not present.  And that became that TALK of the film.  ""This was missing....""  ""They didn't show that..."" and similar phrases were bandied about.What had gone wrong?  The official story is that Bakshi ran out of money.  I'm sure that's mostly true.  But I can't help but feel that no one wanted to create this project in the first place for some odd, stupid, and fearfully silly social-psychological reason.  What the fear was, I don't know, and won't even venture to speculate, but thank goodness Peter Jackson came along and did a fantastic epic and proper retelling of one of the great sagas of literature.Technical aspects of the film aren't all that impressive.  It seems like a lot of the budget was spent on the first half of the film, and then once the money started running out the film was rushed with a lot of rotoscoping.  Note that the first half of the film has very sumptuous backgrounds and respectable animation, while the back end of the film is wanting in production values.  Disney it ain't.A lot of movies (most American films that is) are geared toward social psychology of keeping healthy images and feelings coursing through society.  One wonders if there was a negative feeling that Tolkien's tale conveyed that the mental-health types were afraid to put entirely onscreen, and only did so in this half-baked effort.  Either way, the film falls apart half way through, and does not deliver at the end.  We don't see what happens to the ring.  The two main characters vanish into mist with Gollumn, and their wizard winds up leading the army to save middle earth.  But, that's not how Tolkien's books ended.I saw it once when I was younger, and once was enough.  Then I bought a cheap DVD years back, saw it, was reminded of why I only saw the movie once, and then put it away.  I then organized my DVDs and contemplated watching it again, but held off, and instead decided to write this review.Give me an animation team, and I can deliver a Lord of the Rings film with all the aplomb of Jackson, AND I'll keep all the characters and all the story points without shaving stuff, unlike Jackson's two very wonderful and talented lady screenwriters.

Face it Frodo Fans: Peter Jackson wouldn't have been able to make his Trilogy unless Ralph Balkshi hadn't have had the guts and vision to attempt it first with his flawed but brave version.(Jackson has obviously used Balkshi's film as a glorified storyboard.) Sure - some of the animation looks a bit wobbly now next to the modern day likes of Shrek. But other pieces where the Rotoscope process get used properly still pack a punch - the first appearance of the Dark Riders, Frodo getting stabbed, Balrog, the Dark Rider river flooding scene (do you think the  guys who made that award-winning 90's Guinness tv advert about the surfer stole it's white horse-tidal wave image from this movie, or did they bother reading the book? Hmmmmm...) For me, one of the most amazing scenes is the whole opening scene shot in sillohuete, which explains the whole prolougue of the Rings trilogy more concisely and in half the time that Fellowship Of The Ring takes.If your still not convinced that this film matters, just check out how much of Balkshi's inspired interpretation that's been lifted by Peter Jackson- not just all the frame by frame scenes that others have already listed here, but other little details like Sam Gamgee's West country accent, and Gollum's Fagin-like East London Jewish tones.

However, this stand-alone excerpt of the bigger story has its charms - and its fans.For part of a summer, I worked on this film.  The studio was set up in one of the upper floors of a high-rise bank building located on the corner of Sunset Blvd. and Vine St.I especially remember the fabricating of the exquisite background art and the work-in-progress production design by famed illustrator and concept artist Ron Cobb.  I was hoping to do background work but was assigned animation.  Previous to the actual animation start, Bakshi shot the entire film in black and white with actors on a sound stage.  Enlargements of the frames were used as ""guides"" for the artists who would then hand-draw -- kind of trace -- the film characters over the frames of the lives-action sequences.  This rotoscoping process renders some of the scenes with an uncanny life-like appearance that adds immeasurably to the tone of the epic.  (I remember doing a difficult sequence of Gandalf on a running horse.  It's still in the movie.)  However, the infrequent use of overt optical and photographic effects laid onto the animation is startling.  I remember Bakshi as a loud, unfiltered, driven, brilliant Brooklyn artist who had an urgent vision that he was compelled to put on the screen.

344763,A134FLH2KNA0JU,6302906652,Roger McEvilly (the guilty bystander),"[1, 1]","I'll get straight to the point. As an animated (cartoon) rendition of the Lord of the Rings, it has its good points, and bad points. The good side is the artistic rendition of most of the scenes from the novel, albeit in animated form, including a faithful depiction of many of the characters. It's really something very much like ""the Lion King""-animated, colourful, and fun. The bad is that it stopped about half-way through (at Helms Deep), and the makers never had the money or the will to finish it. Also, it has what is called 'rotoscoping'-combining real-life figures with the animated. Some people don't think much of this, as it creates a rather confusing mix of cartoon characters and human outlines, that can be destracting.In its day it was a reasonable commercial success. There are many aspects that are charming and artistic, and some of the renditions of various places and characters really aren't too bad. The Black Riders for example, have deep red eyes, giving them a demonic-like appearance, which works quite well in cartoon form, and most of the leading characters are faithfully depicted. One of the better scenes is perhaps the Flight to the Ford which in this version, like in the book, Frodo is chased alone by the Black Riders. Frodo here borders on the ghostly wraith world, with alternative dream-like sequences, and voices in the ring world being harsh, echoing and clear, and vision and senses heightened.In this version, Legolas replaces Arwen as the elf sent to help Frodo (who in turn replaces Glorfindel in the book), and, as in the 2001 version, there is no Tom Bombadil, Old Forest, or Barrow Wights. But the changes to the book are relatively few overall, most are just abbreviated. Gandalf is rather more lordly and perhaps more arrogant and aloof than in the 2001 film, Saruman is quite similar. Rivendell is short but charming, but Lothlorien is very truncated in the 1978 version, even more so than than in the 2001 film.Compared to the 2001/2/3 films one just doesn't get the grandeur and majesty of such things as real mountains, canyons and human characters, and so it can never match it. But overall it is entertaining and fun, if you don't expect too much. Most Tolkien fans will probably have it in their collection.",4,"Not great, but not bad either (1978 version).",1013731200,"02 15, 2002",2002,2265,"[""'ll"", 'get', 'straight', 'point', 'animated', 'cartoon', 'rendition', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'good', 'points', 'bad', 'points', 'good', 'side', 'artistic', 'rendition', 'most', 'scenes', 'novel', 'albeit', 'animated', 'form', 'including', 'faithful', 'depiction', 'many', 'characters', 'really', 'something', 'very', 'much', 'Lion', 'King', '-animated', 'colourful', 'fun', 'bad', 'stopped', 'half-way', 'Helms', 'Deep', 'makers', 'never', 'had', 'money', 'will', 'finish', 'Also', 'what', 'called', ""'rotoscoping'-combining"", 'real-life', 'figures', 'animated', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'rather', 'confusing', 'mix', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'human', 'outlines', 'can', 'be', 'destracting.In', 'day', 'was', 'reasonable', 'commercial', 'success', 'are', 'many', 'aspects', 'are', 'charming', 'artistic', 'renditions', 'various', 'places', 'characters', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'Black', 'Riders', 'example', 'have', 'deep', 'red', 'eyes', 'giving', 'demonic-like', 'appearance', 'quite', 'well', 'cartoon', 'form', 'most', 'leading', 'characters', 'are', 'faithfully', 'depicted', 'One', 'better', 'scenes', 'perhaps', 'Flight', 'Ford', 'version', 'book', 'Frodo', 'chased', 'alone', 'Black', 'Riders', 'Frodo', 'here', 'ghostly', 'wraith', 'world', 'alternative', 'dream-like', 'sequences', 'voices', 'ring', 'world', 'being', 'harsh', 'echoing', 'clear', 'vision', 'heightened.In', 'version', 'Legolas', 'Arwen', 'elf', 'sent', 'help', 'Frodo', 'who', 'turn', 'replaces', 'Glorfindel', 'book', '2001', 'version', 'Tom', 'Bombadil', 'Old', 'Forest', 'Barrow', 'Wights', 'changes', 'book', 'are', 'relatively', 'few', 'overall', 'most', 'are', 'just', 'abbreviated', 'Gandalf', 'rather', 'more', 'lordly', 'perhaps', 'more', 'arrogant', 'aloof', '2001', 'film', 'Saruman', 'quite', 'similar', 'Rivendell', 'short', 'charming', 'Lothlorien', 'very', 'truncated', '1978', 'version', 'even', 'more', 'so', '2001', 'film.Compared', '2001/2/3', 'films', 'one', 'just', ""n't"", 'get', 'grandeur', 'majesty', 'such', 'things', 'real', 'mountains', 'canyons', 'human', 'characters', 'can', 'never', 'match', 'overall', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'Most', 'Tolkien', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'collection']",N/A

The VHS has become very rare and Warner has wisely released this film on DVD.  The animation is a mixture of animation and live action, making the characters seem more real than those in the Rankin/Bass productions of the Hobbit and Return of the King (which are also available on DVD and worth purchasing I might add).  I do agree that one should read the books first, because much of the story has been condensed.  This is also ony the first half of the story, being compiled mainly from Fellowship of the Ring and 2/3 of The Two Towers.  Bakshi should have finished the story in a second feature, it would have made for a nice two-disc set, but I am not aware of why this did not happen.The DVD is available in pan-and scan and 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen versions (I thought that only the pan-and-scan version was available until I found the DVD at the store).  The video quality is quite good, and the widescreen version adds more detail to the story.  The sound is Dolby Digital 2.0 surround.  The mix is better than I expected, with good use of the surrounds in battle scenes.  The effects and music are good considering the age of the film.  There is also a cast and crew list section, and a section that explains about the elven and dwarf races.  The package lists a theatrical trailer, but I found none on the disc.This DVD is a good introduction to the Tolkien universe, and a must for Tolkein fans.

344768,A1ERDXS0QLEVKB,6302906652,rzaster,"[0, 0]","I am a huge fan of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; book by J.R.R. Tolkien and when I stumbled upon this animated film of the first two books of the trilogy, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; I decided to watch it. Was I disappointed with the film? Absolutely not! Was the film perfect? No way. But did I thoroughly enjoy it? I sure did. This animated movie is very true to the books in certain places, but in other places the film is very off. It is a lot of fun to see your favorite characters from the books animated on screen and doing what they are doing.As I stated above, this film is based on the first two books of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. The movie starts off with some history about the ring and how Gollum found it and Bilbo Baggins ended up retrieving it. Then the film switches to the present and Frodo, Bilbo's cousin, ends up with the ring. The ring is The One Ring that can rule all of Middle Earth. Then the first part of the movie details the beginning of the quest to destroy the ring. Then in &quot;The Two Towers&quot; film we see the battle at Helm's Deep. The ending of the film is a bit shakey but then I'll have to see the last movie in this cartoon duology to get the full story from the movies.This is a film that is very enjoyable but is still with its flaws. I'll start off with the good parts of the movie. The first part of the film, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; part, is definitely the best as it is truest to the book. We see Bilbo's party at the beginning, the Inn at Bree, the Council of Elrond, and many other things that were in the book. The thing that was very vital yet missing was the Black Riders invading the Shire and trying to find the ring. I was wondering where this part of the movie was. Other good things about the film are the characters and just the feeling that the film gives off in certain places. In many places this film is warm and inviting, probably because of the atmosphere that the movie builds up.The bad parts are mostly that which was in &quot;The Two Towers&quot; part of the film. Most of what happened with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Merry, and Pippin was true to the book as most of this part of the movie revolved around them. However, there was hardly any part of the quest of Frodo and Sam with Gollum. We only really see the two friends meet Gollum and start their quest to Mordor. If you have read the book you will remember that Frodo and Sam met a lot of men from Gondor and had a few adventures getting into the Dark Lord Sauron's city. This was the most missed part of the film. I have yet to see the other movie in this animated duology, but it is possible that this part will be there. I'm not too sure.The animation is mostly very good, but in certain places it looks that there were shots taken from live action movies and placed in an animated setting.

Since the release of Peter Jackson's trilogy, I don't know if I can ever go back to watch this version again.  However, I do need to be fair:  this edition does have some positive aspects.  First of all, the backdrops and rotoscope animation (Bakshi's trademark) I found mesmerizing.  Many other reviewers found them as distractions.  However, the painstaking ordeal to achieve this I can't help but recognize.  Leonard Rosenman's score is terrific.  If anything stands out here as a monument, it's the music.Of course, what ultimately destroyed this film for Tolkien fans and the critics was the rushed storyline, glazing over and simply leaving out certain characters and events, the lack of depth in the characters, and what made the books such classics: DETAIL.  Bakshi was under pressure to get the entire trilogy in one film.  Can't do it.  Sorry!  The studio ran out of time and money.  So, they had to cut it right after the battle of Helms Deep (which by the way, Baskhi rotoscoped battle footage from 1952's IVANHOE with Robert Taylor; nicely done, but didn't slip by me).The details left out are too many to mention, and they do lead to the film's ultimate failure.  LOTR fans who have not seen this should definitely catch this for curiosity and may well want to own it to check out scenes here and there for comparisons.  That will be the ONLY reason.  Parents may well approve this version for young kids who are interested in the story.

I have not read the trilogy yet. I've only read The Hobbit at this point. I did glance at parts of the book that are different between this version and the Peter Jackson movie. Although this version is not as entertaining as the newer, live-action version, it seems to change fewer story elements.The first 80 minutes is from The Fellowship of the Ring. The remaining time covers at least part of The Two Towers. (Since I haven't read the books, I don't know how much of the book is  covered.)Bakshi has an interesting animation style that often takes live footage and makes it look animated. I think he traces the live action and animates it. It's mainly done with background characters and sometimes main characters during action scenes. It's so unusual you either like or hate it. I'm not that picky as long as the story moves along. Personally, I prefer Bakshi's Wizards over this one.This is the only animated movie where I've seen the characters overact. Frodo's gestures are just unnatural to me. It's kinda cheesy to me. I'm not sure if it could be something from a stage production - where gestures have to get across to people in the back of the auditorium. It just doesn't look right.On the plus side, John Hurt and Anthony Daniels are among the voice actors.I originally liked Leonard Rosenman's score until I heard his later scores for Star Trek IV and Robocop 2. He reuses the same basic melodies. I think he also did the score for Beneath The Planet of the Apes, and I don't recall it sounding like the music here.It's hard for me to recommend this title to the typical viewer.

Perhaps an outsider's view is necessary.  Finally, with all due respect to Sir Ian McKellen, William Squire IS Gandalf.

344777,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,6302906652,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[0, 0]","There is considerable controversy over Bakshi's Lord of the Rings. People seem to either love it or hate it, and both with a passion. There is a reason for this. LotR was a grand undertaking in putting to film one of those literary works that many believed to be unfilmable. As a proof of concept the movie was an astounding success. However some of the decisions made in production damaged the artistic consistency of the film. Still Lord of the Rings made a very strong impression on the psyche of Tolkien fans, and has even lent a fair amount of influence on the widely successful Fellowship of the Ring directed by Peter Jackson.For those of you not familiar with Lord of the Rings this movie retells the first book, Fellowship of the Ring and about half of the second book, The Two Towers, into one film. An evil being of immeasurable power (Sauron) is coming back to lay claim to the lands, and all it needs to secure his dominance is a single ring that holds much of his power. A band of adventurers are tasked to take the ring to the only place they know where it can be destroyed. On top of that a prominent king is about to overthrown by forces aligned with Sauron, which members of the fellowship go to aid. Tolkien's story of the ring is pretty much the definitive blueprint for just about every fantasy setting written about since.Bakshi's version is a hybrid animated film that is both rotoscoped cell drawn animation and posterized and shaded live footage. The rotoscoped animation in my opinion is right up there among the best. More on the posterization later. Animation helps give Bakshi the ability to put on film those fantasy elements that would simply not look right in a live action setting. Hobbits can be in their proper size and dimension. Fantasy creatures like the Balrog can be realized (and though Bakshi's Balrog looks very different from any other rendition I find it a really cool version of the creature). And in taking the best parts of Tolkien's work for the script you get some eloquent dialog between the characters.Bakshi made Lord of the Rings with a love of the original books, and was dedicated in making a movie as true to Tolkien's work as possible. Dialog comes straight from the books, as do almost all of the scenes. I say almost because there are a few embellishments put in to either enhance parts of the book that only mentions an event (for dramatic effect) or as a subtle change for aesthetic reasons. The more significant changes really made a difference in terms of that dramatic effect, and can be seen in Jackson's movies as well. For one there is a scene where the Ring Wraiths attempt to assassinate the Hobbits while they sleep to only be tricked by decoys. Another was Boromir's death, where he valiantly tries to protect his comrades against impossible odds. These scenes were only mentioned in the books, but not actually visualized note by note. Not only did Bakshi do a great visualization of these events the exact scenes were adapted to Jackson's movies as well (to great effect). Other changes that both Bakshi and Jackson did (that could be a total coincidence) was to make a scene on Gandalf's capture by Saruman (only mentioned in the book) and change the character that arrives to the rescue with Gandalf to Helm's Deep (Eomir instead of Erkenbrand). Ultimately if you love Jackson's LotR you have to give a not to Bakshi for some of the inspiration.There are things that Bakshi did in his movies I actually prefer over Jackson's version. Take Galadriel's &#34;test&#34; speech for one. Jackson directed that dialog with a healthy dose of dramatic effect that makes me feel it was way overdone and made the mood artificially heightened. With Bakshi the same speech was more playful with Galadriel in more control of her emotions, thus ended with what feels like a more mature dialog. Other little details come up like Aragorn just feels more regal and commanding in Bakshi's version and the interaction between the hobbits felt more personal without being over dramatic. Also I like Gollum's semi-comical approach with some of the dialog (the sneaking dialog I like best). These are more my preferences, but I wanted to at least point out the things I feel were done right.So that's what's done right. Now what was done wrong? Mainly the second half of the movie. Remember that posterization process of animation I mentioned earlier? What you essentially get from that is live action footage (actors in period garb and swords and everything) that is colored and textured to look more like it's animation. It's not a bad process, but you already have half the movie done in a different process. When the scenes that show the posterized characters come you see a glaring contrast. Then you start getting complete scenes that are all posterized that just look cheap when compared to the cell animation. You see the cheap masks the actors are wearing to denote they are orcs, and characters who were previously shaded now look totally different. I understand that Bakshi preferred this process because the actor's subtle emotions can be better expressed, but if you ask me the cell drawings even did that better.Another thing that sticks to my craw are a few of the characters. Boromir for one looks like a freakin' viking. Now don't get me wrong. I can see where that comes from. If you read Tolkien's books there is a lot of Norse references in regards to Boromir's people as well as other nations of men. But at the same time he is supposed to come from one of the largest human kingdoms in the land. I would think they would be beyond furry shorts and horned helmets in that kind of society. Also the non-human characters seem more like background pieces with very little dialog or significant role. This is one thing Jackson really did well in his version.Finally there is a downside to being completely true to a series of novels, and that is movies can never do what novels do. Sure Bakshi made changes that lent more to the visual impact of a film, but at the same time there were lots of scenes that lacked that kind of focus and seemed to be more focused on going through the motions to get to the next chapter. This is especially true in the last part of the movie where the film seems to just abruptly end with a quick narrative dialog and no real coda or conclusion that felt like the movie is over.This Blu-Ray is a pretty good transfer, but it is not remastered. There is a good amount of dirt and blemish you can see from the source material. Still the colors are very sharp and the details are far better than any previous release. The Dolby TrueHD surround track is in my opinion flawed. Dialog looks off sometimes and the simulated surround sound is unimpressive. I wish this disc at least had the original stereo English track to make up for it. At least you get this movie in French, Spanish and German. There is one extra on the disc, and that is Forging Through The Darkness. It's an older documentary that runs about a half hour and is in standard definition. It chronicles Bakshi's career as an upstart animator and covers his entire work and not just this film.I don't think this movie deserves the hate, but I at least understand it. All in all Bakshi's Lord of the Rings is a very worthwhile film that deserves to be noted in the annals of fantasy movies. It is far from perfect, but what it got right it got really right. I would recommend this film mostly to Tolkien fans who have read the books, or at least seen Jackson's trilogy. Those unfamiliar with the content may feel lost for no other reason than those scenes that go through the motions on the second half. This Blu-Ray is the best looking transfer that's out there, and the added documentary make it the most complete collection.",4,"Resoundly imperfect. Undeniably a great work of art.

Sure it looks dated!  It was a time unto itself, and I remember a cloud of smoke in the theatre that seemed to permeate everything, while I watched the wild imagery up on the screen.  The hairstyles, the coloring, the ambience of the film were all part of the era, but they still seem to lend themselves to the positive side of the viewing experience, and not to the negative.  Maybe younger persons will find it flaky, or just plain stupid, but that is something to be expected from kids who have their ideas, and ideals, spoon-fed to them by MTV, and a culture that seems to regard Fantasy as a wasteland-realm for the socially mis-fit.And ENOUGH from the HARDCORE, Tolkein, religeous-right!  Any of you who claim Bakshi didn't see it the way it was supposed to be, or state that he &quot;put bad 70's hair on everyone&quot;, should &quot;get out of your parent's basements and find a job, and a girlfriend!

Even as a kid, I was disappointed.But I gotta say that Bakshi DID capture some great atmosphere in this movie.  Come on, you've got to love the psychedelic scene of the Wraith on horseback, menacing Frodo by the riverside!  Or how about that Balrog?!?  Really, really cool.  The fact that much of the animation utilized the 'tracing' technique only adds to the uniqueness to me, and at times, it is a genuine strength.  This is well illustrated by the character Sam...his kinetic and fluid expressions are so much fun to watch.  There are weak moments in the animation (for instance, the orc hordes who &quot;stand&quot; absolutely motionless, with the exception of a couple awkwardly wiggling spears...ugghhh), but I think that the weaknesses are outweighed by the strengths, in terms of visuals.As for the DVD, the picture is very good, and I'm so glad that it's in widescreen.  I'd like to have seen a &quot;making of&quot; though, explaining more about the whole rotoscope technique, and the reasons for the movie ending the way it does.

Why the back cover says otherwise is a mystery to me (as the original release of this on DVD stated that it was presented in widescreen).As for the picture quality, it looks quite good, with only the odd bit of film related dust specks/print damage, to the point that it's almost non-existent.

I'm not bashing Jackson's vision or his movies, they were a singular achievement, one that probably will never be (or should never be) bested.

The Balrog is more something to laugh at then to be terrified of as it is merely a man of about 6 or 7 feet, dressed in a costume with a Lion's head, large bat wings and furry boots cracking a whip.  Woooooooo, so scary.  Worst of all are the Orcs which are all filmed not animated and are live action extras wearing what look like really bad rubber Halloween ape masks with large tusks and draped in some sort of burlap sack/toga clothing.  Once again, the Orcs are bad, I mean BAD!  The story also attempted to tell the first two books instead of just focusing on one which makes for a very convoluted and, more often then not, confusing film.  For those who have not read the books, you will be completely lost as to what is going on about 45 minutes into the film.  Rankin/Bass released a much more delightful version of the final book in ""The Lord Of The Ring"" trilogy with their attempt at ""Return Of The King"".  Although the Rankin/Bass version may come up short in places (some unnecessary musical numbers), it does deliver so much more to the viewing audience with it's beautifully realized character depictions.  The animation may not be the smoothest with ROTK, but the characters and scenery are much more delightful and colorful, the way you'd expect them to be in an animated film.  For many years, Bakshi's ""Lord Of The Rings"" was the only film telling of Tolkien's epic that one could view, fortunately that has changed with the magnificent new version created for the big screen by Peter Jackson.  Your best bet is to pass on this version, go see the NEW version and buy that one on DVD or VHS when it is released in the later part of 2002.  BUT, with that said, if you want to have a real laugh at a really bad film then by all means purchase the animated version of LOTR and be amazed at the terrible way Bakshi botched this story up.

Many of the film's artistic shortcomings -- and more than a few of its remarkable visual strengths -- can be traced to the penny-pinching approach. As with his later, underrated _Fire and Ice_, Bakshi uses rotoscoped animation to simulate live-action filmmaking without the expense.  (After all, why build a set and hire thousands of actors when you can draw it all instead?)In a sense, this approach to filmmaking is much more common today: Current F/X design enables designers to place live-action human actors in computer-generated settings. The process of ""motion capture"" has become the digital age's equivalent of rotoscoping, for it uses computerized tracking to record live-action movements and ""trace"" those movements onto CGI characters.To be fair, this _LOTR_ has more than its share of faults. The story is fatally muddled. Despite the fairly high caliber of acting, the script and direction cannot keep characters' basic identities and motivations straight. In short, Tolkien purists have every right to be outraged at Ralph Bakshi. But for persons interested in craft, this rotoscoped film -- neither live-action nor animation as we understand it -- makes the interesting case that, if a filmmaker is willing to use ingenious and unconventional techniques, a small budget need not hamper grand ambitions.",4,"Flawed, low-budget fantasy film",1015632000,"03 9, 2002",2002,1438,"['example', 'what', 'fantasy', 'film', 'can', 'do', '_extremely_', 'tight', 'budget', 'Bakshi', '_Lord', 'Rings_', 'quite', 'good', 'Many', 'film', 'artistic', 'shortcomings', 'more', 'few', 'remarkable', 'visual', 'strengths', 'can', 'be', 'traced', 'penny-pinching', 'approach', 'later', 'underrated', '_Fire', 'Ice_', 'Bakshi', 'rotoscoped', 'animation', 'simulate', 'live-action', 'filmmaking', 'expense', 'why', 'build', 'set', 'hire', 'thousands', 'actors', 'when', 'can', 'draw', 'instead', 'sense', 'approach', 'filmmaking', 'much', 'more', 'common', 'today', 'Current', 'F/X', 'design', 'designers', 'place', 'live-action', 'human', 'actors', 'computer-generated', 'settings', 'process', 'motion', 'capture', 'become', 'digital', 'age', 'equivalent', 'rotoscoping', 'computerized', 'tracking', 'record', 'live-action', 'movements', 'trace', 'movements', 'CGI', 'characters.To', 'be', 'fair', '_LOTR_', 'more', 'share', 'faults', 'story', 'fatally', 'muddled', 'fairly', 'high', 'caliber', 'acting', 'script', 'direction', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'characters', 'basic', 'identities', 'motivations', 'straight', 'short', 'Tolkien', 'purists', 'have', 'right', 'be', 'outraged', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'persons', 'interested', 'craft', 'rotoscoped', 'film', 'live-action', 'animation', 'understand', 'interesting', 'case', 'filmmaker', 'willing', 'use', 'ingenious', 'unconventional', 'techniques', 'small', 'budget', 'need', 'not', 'hamper', 'grand', 'ambitions']",N/A
344788,A1LZVU5SRRM3VX,6302906652,Timothy Michael Resh,"[3, 6]","I have had this DVD in my drawer for a long time, and this weekend my daughter asked to watch it after watching the much more child-friendly ""The Hobbit"" a day earlier.  Before watching it, I explained the concept of the story to her, but I could tell she didn't really get it.Watching this version after a long hiatus from the story, I didn't get it, either.  While in some cases this adaptation sticks a bit more closely to Tolkein's novels than Peter Jackson's adaptations, the writing in LOTR is very uneven.  The film starts very slowly in Hobbiton, expending far too much exposition time there, while barely incorporating the treason of Isengard or the ring-lust of Gollum. Ultimately, this is understandable, as the word on the web is that the studio wanted to compress three books into two films.  In doing so, however, the epic nature of the journey to Mordor is largely trivialized.Looking at the production values, one can only be glad that the rotoscoping technique used to create the orcs, the nazgul, and most of the human characters in the story never really caught on.  The characters literally fade in and out from definable figures into earthen blobs.  Interestingly enough, though, it is clear that Peter Jackson took some visual cues from the film, as the staging of a number of scenes and some of the artistic representations between the films are strikingly similar.  Give me Jackson's magnum opus any day, though.There are a few points of interest--namely John Hurt's voicing of Aragorn and Anthony Daniels as a thoroughly underutilized Legolas, but these hardly compensate for the major flaws in pacing and consistency.  For unknown reasons, the wizard Saruman is alternately referred to as ""Saruman"" and ""Aruman,"" and many of the intricacies of Middle Earth are either glossed over or totally ignored.At over 2 hours in length, my daughter became largely disinterested in the film, particularly during the Helm's Deep sequence, which was excessively long and excessively graphic for a PG film, even an animated one.  We then watched the Rankin-Bass adaptation of Return of the King, which interestingly enough manages to summarize the preceeding events in one sentence.Note that the animated versions of The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, and Return of the King are often packaged as a set, but this entry in the series is much different and much less polished than the other two.",2,Bakshi's adaptation just misses the point.,1169510400,"01 23, 2007",2007,2401,"['have', 'had', 'DVD', 'drawer', 'long', 'time', 'weekend', 'daughter', 'asked', 'watch', 'watching', 'much', 'more', 'child-friendly', 'Hobbit', 'day', 'earlier', 'watching', 'explained', 'concept', 'story', 'could', 'tell', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'it.Watching', 'version', 'long', 'hiatus', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'either', 'cases', 'adaptation', 'bit', 'more', 'closely', 'Tolkein', 'novels', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'adaptations', 'writing', 'LOTR', 'very', 'uneven', 'film', 'very', 'slowly', 'Hobbiton', 'expending', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'exposition', 'time', 'there', 'barely', 'incorporating', 'treason', 'Isengard', 'ring-lust', 'Gollum', 'Ultimately', 'understandable', 'word', 'web', 'studio', 'wanted', 'compress', 'three', 'books', 'two', 'films', 'doing', 'so', 'however', 'epic', 'nature', 'journey', 'Mordor', 'largely', 'trivialized.Looking', 'production', 'values', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'glad', 'rotoscoping', 'technique', 'used', 'create', 'orcs', 'nazgul', 'most', 'human', 'characters', 'story', 'never', 'really', 'caught', 'characters', 'literally', 'fade', 'definable', 'figures', 'earthen', 'blobs', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'though', 'clear', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'took', 'visual', 'cues', 'film', 'staging', 'number', 'scenes', 'artistic', 'representations', 'films', 'are', 'strikingly', 'similar', 'Give', 'Jackson', 'magnum', 'opus', 'day', 'are', 'few', 'points', 'interest', 'namely', 'John', 'Hurt', 'voicing', 'Aragorn', 'Anthony', 'Daniels', 'thoroughly', 'underutilized', 'Legolas', 'hardly', 'compensate', 'major', 'flaws', 'pacing', 'consistency', 'unknown', 'reasons', 'wizard', 'Saruman', 'alternately', 'referred', 'Saruman', 'Aruman', 'many', 'intricacies', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'are', 'glossed', 'totally', 'ignored.At', '2', 'hours', 'length', 'daughter', 'became', 'largely', 'disinterested', 'film', 'particularly', 'Helm', 'Deep', 'sequence', 'was', 'excessively', 'long', 'excessively', 'graphic', 'PG', 'film', 'even', 'animated', 'one', 'then', 'watched', 'Rankin-Bass', 'adaptation', 'Return', 'King', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'summarize', 'preceeding', 'events', 'one', 'sentence.Note', 'animated', 'versions', 'Hobbit', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Return', 'King', 'are', 'often', 'packaged', 'set', 'entry', 'series', 'much', 'different', 'much', 'less', 'polished', 'other', 'two']",N/A

Otherwise, I think this film more faithfully recreates the spirit of Tolkien's book than the new live action movie.  For those who judge a film largely on its visual qualities, the new film towers over this much older attempt.  However, in focusing so much on the spectacular action, the new film glosses over or completely avoids the less intense parts of the story that let you get to know each of the large cast of characters, and that makes the world of Middle Earth much more complex and interesting.  While the characters are for the most part very well done in the new movie, this animated version does a better job, especially with Frodo, Sam, and Aragorn.  The new movie largely fails to capture the GRADUAL intensification and dissolving naivete of the hobbits' journey to Bree, the tranquility and enjoyment of Rivendell, and the happy, healing atmosphere that Galadriel's Lothlorien brings following the loss of Gandalf.  These are more faithfully done in this animated version.  The dialogue in this movie is better overall as well.

Berk,"[3, 3]","At first I was very critical of this low-budget animated retelling of the first half of Tolkien's epic, especially due to the fact that I have seen the epic Peter Jackson trilogy.  If I had done this review immediately after seeing this movie surely I would have passed it off as poorly constructed, and a butchering of Tolkien...but after discussing the film with other enthusiasts and making comparisons to the books I must say there are a few things they do better than Jackson...nothing major, but there are a few things that make this adaptation commendable.ProsFrodo - This is more of Tolkien's Frodo than the Elijah Wood Frodo.  This Frodo will willingly throw himself into danger, draw his sword, and fight without screaming like a pansy for his larger companions (or later Sam) to rescue him.  The one problem is the voice-actor doesn't capture any real emotion.Aragorn - Don't get me wrong, I liked Viggo in the new films, but he really never seemed like a king...just a mercenary.  John Hurt on the other hand (one of the greatest screen actors of all time) gives the brutality of a rogue, as well as the elegance of royalty in his voice.  Why he is portrayed as a Native American in a miniskirt remains a mystery in my mind because it practically destroys the credibility of Hurt's voice-acting.OkayGollum - He's okay, but just seems poor after you've seen Jackson's.  At least they get most of the key concepts of the characterBattles - Now, Jackson may win on sheer AWESOME levels when it comes to his actions scenes, but while these scenes may be ""bad"" at least none of the characters come across as superheroes as they did in the Jackson movies.The UglyAnimation - Most of the film is very choppy and poorly put together.  Sure, when it's fully animated it's okay, but in the second half of the film they seem to run out of money so attempted more cheap techniques than could be countedCharacter Designs - Between Borimir being a Viking, hobbits looking like small children, Saruman (or as this movie says ""Aruman"") being Santa Clause, and the before mentioned Native American Aragorn...but nothing can compare to the horror that is Bakshi's abominable Balrog (special mention to Julius Caesar Elrond)Cut and paste dialogue - It feels like they took lots of key quotes from the book without thinking at all of the build-up dialogue that made the quotes work in the books.  This results in many scenes (especially the Council of Elrond) coming across as confusing.Sam - Do not get me started on this physically and mentally retarded interpretationSo this movie is good for the kids for exposing them to Tolkien, but it isn't an opus of Tolkien's work (that goes without saying), but then again neither is Jackson's.  The only way to truly revel in Tolkien's work is to let yourself be consumed by his books, but Jackson's movies did come close to hitting the magic of Tolkien.",3,"Uneven, at times horrificly bad, but does have advantages",1259884800,"12 4, 2009",2009,2891,"['first', 'was', 'very', 'critical', 'low-budget', 'animated', 'retelling', 'first', 'half', 'Tolkien', 'epic', 'especially', 'due', 'fact', 'have', 'seen', 'epic', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'trilogy', 'had', 'done', 'review', 'immediately', 'seeing', 'movie', 'surely', 'would', 'have', 'passed', 'off', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'butchering', 'Tolkien', 'discussing', 'film', 'other', 'enthusiasts', 'making', 'comparisons', 'books', 'must', 'say', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'do', 'better', 'Jackson', 'nothing', 'major', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'make', 'adaptation', 'more', 'Tolkien', 'Frodo', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Frodo', 'Frodo', 'will', 'willingly', 'throw', 'danger', 'draw', 'sword', 'fight', 'screaming', 'pansy', 'larger', 'companions', 'later', 'Sam', 'rescue', 'one', 'problem', 'voice-actor', ""n't"", 'capture', 'real', 'emotion.Aragorn', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'liked', 'Viggo', 'new', 'films', 'really', 'never', 'seemed', 'king', 'just', 'mercenary', 'John', 'Hurt', 'other', 'hand', 'one', 'greatest', 'screen', 'actors', 'time', 'brutality', 'rogue', 'as', 'well', 'elegance', 'royalty', 'voice', 'Why', 'portrayed', 'Native', 'American', 'miniskirt', 'mystery', 'mind', 'practically', 'credibility', 'Hurt', 'voice-acting.OkayGollum', 'okay', 'just', 'poor', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Jackson', 'least', 'get', 'most', 'key', 'concepts', 'characterBattles', 'Now', 'Jackson', 'may', 'win', 'sheer', 'AWESOME', 'levels', 'when', 'actions', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'may', 'be', 'bad', 'least', 'none', 'characters', 'come', 'as', 'superheroes', 'did', 'Jackson', 'movies.The', 'UglyAnimation', 'Most', 'film', 'very', 'choppy', 'poorly', 'put', 'together', 'Sure', 'when', 'fully', 'animated', 'okay', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'seem', 'run', 'out', 'money', 'so', 'attempted', 'more', 'cheap', 'techniques', 'could', 'be', 'countedCharacter', 'Designs', 'Between', 'Borimir', 'being', 'Viking', 'looking', 'small', 'children', 'Saruman', 'movie', 'Aruman', 'being', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'before', 'mentioned', 'Native', 'American', 'Aragorn', 'nothing', 'can', 'compare', 'horror', 'Bakshi', 'abominable', 'Balrog', 'special', 'mention', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'Elrond', 'Cut', 'paste', 'dialogue', 'took', 'lots', 'key', 'quotes', 'book', 'thinking', 'build-up', 'dialogue', 'made', 'quotes', 'work', 'books', 'results', 'many', 'scenes', 'especially', 'Council', 'Elrond', 'coming', 'confusing.Sam', 'Do', 'not', 'get', 'started', 'physically', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'interpretationSo', 'movie', 'good', 'kids', 'exposing', 'Tolkien', ""n't"", 'opus', 'Tolkien', 'work', 'saying', 'then', 'again', 'Jackson', 'only', 'way', 'truly', 'revel', 'Tolkien', 'work', 'let', 'be', 'consumed', 'books', 'Jackson', 'movies', 'did', 'come', 'close', 'hitting', 'magic', 'Tolkien']",N/A

So for years to follow, I perused the book stores, and Seller of the OOP dealers, to find more and more  info about this wonderful world of JRR Tolkien. Yearly treks to the U-City Loop to see the film, followed by countless hours of reading and research to come up with just one more scrap of informatiom.

For a first attempt, Bakshi did a worthy job of trying to translate one of the greatest pieces of fiction. The story is adapted very well but everything else just goes downhill. The animation is sub-par. The Roto-Scoping, in my opinion, is just a cheap easy-way-out and it looks terrible. It isn't consistent. One moment it's good, the next it's crippled and dirty, and then it looks downright disgusting. The Orcs, Nazgul, and the fight scenes just look bad. There are many moments that just drag on for too long and it makes me want to stop it when I'm less than half way through. The character designs are so bad, I mean Aragorn looks like Javier Bordem from ""No Country for Old Men"" mixed with an Indian. Legola's eyes bother me, Gimli is about just as tall as Aragorn, and Sam looks silly. And seriously, Sam and Frodo ARE GAY in this film, just look at how they close in for a kiss when Aragorn tells them the Lay of Luthien. The score is bad, it's neither dramatic or fantastical. The film consists of the first two parts of ""The Lord of the Rings"". Why they wouldn't Bakshi finish it (a reasonable excuse) is beyond me. I can say I won't be watching this movie ever again because it's downright garbage in my eyes. There's no drama, no emotional aspect, nowhere for an audience to connect with the story or characters. Bakshi, while being either a good filmmaker or a really bad one, didn't give justice to Tolkien's work. Thank God Peter Jackson gave us his 3 legendary live-action flicks. Oh, and it looks okay on Blu Ray, definitely better than its DVD counterpart, although you'd expect a much better transfer. I mean, Disney spends millions restoring ""Snow White"" and it looks fantastic. Oh, the 30 minute special feature is pretty bad. It's more of a documentary about Bakshi and Warner Bros. trying to sell him as the ""savior"" of animation than it is about LOTR. They won't let a moment go by where they didn't trash Disney (they don't hesitate to say indirectly they outdid Disney). Bakshi even bashes those who don't hand-draw everything, considering he Roto-Scoped half of his film (cheater, cheater). Modesty, indeed. All in all, I only got this to complete my LOTR Blu Ray collection. I wouldn't recommend it if you already have it on DVD or are thinking of getting it.

344794,A1A8KJ066DQ3US,6302906652,Warren J. Dew,"[25, 36]","Ralph Bakshi's ""The Lord of the Rings"" is an animated film adaptation of the first half of Tolkien's classic fantasy trilogy by the same name.  Unfortunately, Bakshi never went on to produce another film covering the rest of Tolkien's story.If you read the early reviews of this movie - which you can do by clicking on 'see all customer reviews' and selecting 'oldest first' - you'll see that they were nearly all enthusiastic.  Many of those early reviews specifically requested a DVD version.  Yet, now that the DVD version is available - in the original 2:1 wide screen format - the recent reviews are mixed.  What happened?What happened was that Peter Jackson's modern, blockbuster film adaptations of the same story came out.  Jackson's films cover the entirity of Tolkien's trilogy, with a big budget that permitted the use of the best in live action and modern computer graphics animation.  This 1978 Bakshi film, with a fraction of the budget and using now dated technology, looks primitive by comparison.And yet, this Bakshi version has many charms, especially for lovers of Tolkien's books.  Bakshi better captures the spirit of Tolkien's work, remaining true to the basic story and making good use of Tolkien's timeless prose.  Unlike Jackson, Bakshi does not take liberties with characterization: he retains Tolkien's portrayal of Boromir's ambiguous character without turning him into a simplistic bad guy; he doesn't change Saruman from a would be rival of the Dark Lord into a simple minion; he brings out Theoden's underlying nobility.  The only real problem is the abrupt ending of the story - and that's only an issue because Bakshi never went on to create a sequel.If you do want something with modern, big budget production values, you'll probably prefer Jackson's version.  If you've already seen Jackson's films and are looking for more of the same, you won't find it here.If, on the other hand, you're more interested in a movie that's true to the spirit of Tolkien's classic masterpiece - and if you'll be happy with animation techniques with a certain quaint charm, and with a movie that covers only the first half of Tolkien's story - this DVD is for you.",4,True to the Spirit of the Tolkien's Fantasy Masterpiece,1075939200,"02 5, 2004",2004,2181,"['Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'animated', 'film', 'adaptation', 'first', 'half', 'Tolkien', 'classic', 'fantasy', 'trilogy', 'same', 'name', 'Unfortunately', 'Bakshi', 'never', 'went', 'produce', 'film', 'covering', 'rest', 'Tolkien', 'story.If', 'read', 'early', 'reviews', 'movie', 'can', 'do', 'clicking', ""'see"", 'customer', 'reviews', 'selecting', ""'oldest"", 'first', ""'ll"", 'see', 'were', 'nearly', 'enthusiastic', 'Many', 'early', 'reviews', 'specifically', 'requested', 'DVD', 'version', 'now', 'DVD', 'version', 'available', 'original', '2:1', 'wide', 'screen', 'format', 'recent', 'reviews', 'are', 'mixed', 'What', 'happened', 'What', 'happened', 'was', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'modern', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'adaptations', 'same', 'story', 'came', 'out', 'Jackson', 'films', 'cover', 'entirity', 'Tolkien', 'trilogy', 'big', 'budget', 'permitted', 'use', 'best', 'live', 'action', 'modern', 'computer', 'graphics', 'animation', '1978', 'Bakshi', 'film', 'fraction', 'budget', 'using', 'now', 'dated', 'technology', 'primitive', 'comparison.And', 'yet', 'Bakshi', 'version', 'many', 'charms', 'especially', 'lovers', 'Tolkien', 'books', 'Bakshi', 'better', 'spirit', 'Tolkien', 'work', 'remaining', 'true', 'basic', 'story', 'making', 'good', 'use', 'Tolkien', 'timeless', 'prose', 'Jackson', 'Bakshi', 'not', 'take', 'liberties', 'characterization', 'Tolkien', 'portrayal', 'Boromir', 'ambiguous', 'character', 'turning', 'simplistic', 'bad', 'guy', ""n't"", 'change', 'Saruman', 'would', 'be', 'rival', 'Dark', 'Lord', 'simple', 'minion', 'out', 'Theoden', 'underlying', 'nobility', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'story', 'only', 'issue', 'Bakshi', 'never', 'went', 'create', 'sequel.If', 'do', 'want', 'something', 'modern', 'big', 'budget', 'production', 'values', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'prefer', 'Jackson', 'version', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'Jackson', 'films', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'same', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'other', 'hand', ""'re"", 'more', 'interested', 'movie', 'true', 'spirit', 'Tolkien', 'classic', 'masterpiece', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'animation', 'techniques', 'certain', 'quaint', 'charm', 'movie', 'only', 'first', 'half', 'Tolkien', 'story', 'DVD']",N/A

344797,AUTBHG6070SL4,6302906652,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[4, 8]","This has my vote for best feature-length animation ever. Although mostly drawn, it includes a lot of processed live action. The imagery, in many cases, is a layered composite of ink wash, cel animation, and photography. All of the photography is heavily processed, with hand-drawn extras - it effectively extends the animation instead of competing with it. The main characters are all well drawn, and I am impressed with the motion. Even the cartoony characters create very natural-looking action.The only problem with this movie is that it took on a story so widely known and well loved. Tolkien purists will cringe at every detail lost; many were lost in reducing this to reasonable length and to the animation technology of its time. What's worse is that so many Tolkien fans have built up pictures of their own for the story's places and people. No director can hope to compete with the fan's personal fantasies. It is nearly impossible for an adaptation of such well-loved text to be considered on its own merits. It is almost as hard to look, today, at a movie made under technological and economic limits of an earlier decade.If you can watch this for just for itself, the rewards are significant. Bakshi communicates just with pictures better than most do with action, script, music and all the rest combined.
