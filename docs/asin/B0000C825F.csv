773802,A1U0HUXO9GLOUD,B0000C825F,"Akira ""gigatonx""","[7, 8]","I can say without a doubt that GTO is my favorite anime of all time. It tells the story of Eikichi Onizuka, an ex-biker and virgin, and his quest to become the greatest teacher alive.  But to reach his goal he'll have to get by his proclaimed adversary the vice-principal, bullies, classroom terrorists, and the mob.  All while trying to instill life lessons upon his students and find himself a girlfriend.To me GTO has it all: a great story,  excellent character development, life applicable lessons, and enough laughs to having you rolling on the floor.

I mean, it's your typical cool-teacher-bad-class plot and it's pretty much predictable most of the time. Animation looks VERY bad for it's time. The VA is good, Both of the OPs are Awesome! Characters are all good and developed (The students anyway).What troubled me was that there were so many characters, near the end I couldn't remember which was which.

773805,APFLDLBMCWCQQ,B0000C825F,"M. Zummo ""mike_in_milwaukee""","[5, 6]","I purchased all the DVDs individually.  Each volume contains incredible stories taking you on a ride of laughs, paniced moments, frenzied 'what's gonna happen next?' and even a few tear jerkers!  I think this is one of the most entertaining, diverse Anime series I have ever seen.  The off-the-wall antics of Onizuka are something to behold!  And the twists and turns in each story line keep you glued watching it!  I highly recommend this!  The first few ephisodes make him out to be a perve, and while he still kind of is, there's something captivating about him (that you'll discover if you keep watching).The animation quality is pretty good (not as good as say .hack, but very well done).  The characters supporting GTO are also diverse, entertaining, and...  Well, the whole thing is a train wreck that you just HAVE TO WATCH! ....",5,Incredible ride!,1069027200,"11 17, 2003",2003,837,"['purchased', 'DVDs', 'individually', 'volume', 'incredible', 'stories', 'taking', 'ride', 'laughs', 'paniced', 'moments', 'frenzied', ""'what"", 'gon', 'happen', 'next', 'even', 'few', 'tear', 'jerkers', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'diverse', 'Anime', 'series', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'off-the-wall', 'antics', 'Onizuka', 'are', 'something', 'behold', 'twists', 'turns', 'story', 'line', 'keep', 'glued', 'watching', 'highly', 'recommend', 'first', 'few', 'ephisodes', 'make', 'be', 'perve', 'still', 'kind', 'something', 'captivating', ""'ll"", 'discover', 'keep', 'watching', '.The', 'animation', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'say', '.hack', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'characters', 'supporting', 'GTO', 'are', 'also', 'diverse', 'entertaining', 'Well', 'whole', 'thing', 'train', 'wreck', 'just', 'HAVE', 'TO', 'WATCH']",N/A

You see the problem with GTO is that it's too addicting.  I've already watched volumes 1-3, skipped 4 and then bought and watched 5-7; yep, only 4 volumes left to go.  I'm like an anime zombitaku (that's zombie and otaku jumbled together; yeah I know waaay too much free time); ""must . . . watch . . . G . . . T . . . O . . .""Anyways, GTO is an excellent anime series with something to offer anyone who is willing to watch.  And trust me you're gonna need plenty of time to watch, because once you do you won't be able to stop.  It's like a drug-induced joy ride complete with karate-do, bikes, cars, races, girls in uniforms, comedy, plot and a whole lotta teacher-haters.Okay, about that plot.  Onizuka (the Great Teacher guy) was once a biker gang big shot.  Now he's on a mission to become the best teacher in all of Japan.  But there's one thing stopping him; the students in his middle school class.  Throughout the series Onizuka teaches and learns from his students.  Helping the kids to work out their problems.  Each one bringing him one step closer to his goal.Released by TOKYOPOP this is definitely a must-own series for any anime fan.  Trust me you're gonna end up needing another pleasure inducing volume of GTO after the end of every DVD.  So be prepared to spend, spend and spend some more.

The manga is MUCH better .. not because the animation is bad (on the contrary I think it's pretty good) but because gto is such a plot filled story that in the anime all that plot was just sucked away. The most important details that in the manga explain everything and the clues and hints given to you volume by volume, are not in the anime. Regardless of that, is SOOOOO GOODD i recomend you to go buy it NOW !!! it's hilarious, original and has deep plot (not the kind of plot that u just want to puke and die, on the contrary) very good plot, and the characters are complex(more on the manga ..much much more). With that said, if u can get your hands on the manga before you see the anime it would  be awesome and you will understand what I mean. There's 25 volumes with the 24th out now. Almost over .. :'(You just can't get enough of GTO, it's an addiction, :D",5,PLEASE read the manga first!,1115683200,"05 10, 2005",2005,1025,"['Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'LOVE', 'gto', ""'m"", 'hardcore', 'fan', 'gto', 'would', 'live', 'deserted', 'island', 'only', 'had', 'gto', 'manga', 'point', 'manga', 'MUCH', 'better', '..', 'not', 'animation', 'bad', 'contrary', 'think', 'pretty', 'good', 'gto', 'such', 'plot', 'filled', 'story', 'anime', 'plot', 'was', 'just', 'sucked', 'away', 'most', 'important', 'details', 'manga', 'explain', 'everything', 'clues', 'hints', 'given', 'volume', 'volume', 'are', 'not', 'anime', 'Regardless', 'SOOOOO', 'GOODD', 'i', 'recomend', 'go', 'buy', 'NOW', 'hilarious', 'original', 'deep', 'plot', 'not', 'kind', 'plot', 'u', 'just', 'want', 'puke', 'die', 'contrary', 'very', 'good', 'plot', 'characters', 'are', 'complex', 'more', 'manga', '..much', 'much', 'more', 'said', 'u', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'manga', 'see', 'anime', 'would', 'be', 'awesome', 'will', 'understand', 'what', 'mean', '25', 'volumes', '24th', 'out', 'now', 'Almost', '..', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'GTO', 'addiction', 'D']",N/A
