1019471,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B000I8OMDU,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[11, 12]","Director/writer/producer/editor David de Vos stars in this film about Doug, a man with a failing flight school business and a stressed out marriage, who one day gets a call telling him that his biological father, who he has never known, wants to see him. The State authorities say the father is not competent and should be institutionalized, but Doug decides a different fate for him.  The film centers on this relationship, and it is often touching, and will be appreciated by anyone who has taken care of an elderly parent.Victor Lundin is excellent as Gene, the eccentric father, whose house looks a little like the shack in ""A Beautiful Mind."" Also good is Frances Black as Abby, Doug's wife, and they have a good script to work with, that is often thought provoking.  ""The Theory of Everything"" is a 2006 very low budget production that holds its own and is always entertaining. It has Christian themes but no one will ever be able to say it is ""preachy,"" and shows that Mr. de Vos has a lot of talent in many areas. Shown on Trinity Broadcasting Network, it is well worth your time to watch if you see it listed to be aired on television.",4,"""Maybe He finds us""",1162339200,"11 1, 2006",2006,1144,"['Director/writer/producer/editor', 'David', 'de', 'Vos', 'stars', 'film', 'Doug', 'man', 'failing', 'flight', 'school', 'business', 'stressed', 'out', 'marriage', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'call', 'telling', 'biological', 'father', 'who', 'never', 'known', 'see', 'State', 'authorities', 'say', 'father', 'not', 'competent', 'should', 'be', 'institutionalized', 'Doug', 'different', 'fate', 'film', 'centers', 'relationship', 'often', 'touching', 'will', 'be', 'appreciated', 'anyone', 'who', 'taken', 'care', 'elderly', 'parent.Victor', 'Lundin', 'excellent', 'Gene', 'eccentric', 'father', 'house', 'little', 'shack', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'Also', 'good', 'Frances', 'Black', 'Abby', 'Doug', 'wife', 'have', 'good', 'script', 'work', 'often', 'thought', 'provoking', 'Theory', 'Everything', '2006', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'production', 'own', 'always', 'entertaining', 'Christian', 'themes', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'say', 'preachy', 'Mr.', 'de', 'Vos', 'lot', 'talent', 'many', 'areas', 'Shown', 'Trinity', 'Broadcasting', 'Network', 'well', 'time', 'watch', 'see', 'listed', 'be', 'aired', 'television']",The Theory of Everything

Dying of an incurable disease, his time is short so he calls upon the child he gave up to adoption years ago. Now a grown man with a family of his own he decides to meet his birth Father for the first time in the hope that he can help him out of a bad financial situation. An unlikely familial bond is formed and the race to find the divine equation is begun now pursued by both father and son.`The Theory of Everything' released in '05 is one of the better Christian movies available today. The gospel message is present but it's not overpowering so the movie can be watched and enjoyed without feeling pressured to convert. It also provides a nice, basic introduction to the world of quantum physics, particle theory and the concept of a ten dimensional universe. Consider it evangelization through higher math.",4,"""The Things That Define Our Lives"" ~ Faith & Higher Mathematics Merge Under The Aurora Borealis",1183507200,"07 4, 2007",2007,935,"['Synopsis', 'Elderly', 'man', 'living', 'alone', 'searches', 'proof', 'God', 'existence', 'scientific', 'discipline', 'mathematics', 'Dying', 'incurable', 'disease', 'time', 'short', 'so', 'child', 'gave', 'up', 'adoption', 'years', 'ago', 'Now', 'grown', 'man', 'family', 'own', 'meet', 'birth', 'Father', 'first', 'time', 'hope', 'can', 'help', 'bad', 'financial', 'situation', 'unlikely', 'familial', 'bond', 'formed', 'race', 'find', 'divine', 'equation', 'begun', 'now', 'pursued', 'father', 'son.', 'Theory', 'Everything', 'released', ""'05"", 'one', 'better', 'Christian', 'movies', 'available', 'today', 'gospel', 'message', 'present', 'not', 'overpowering', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'feeling', 'pressured', 'convert', 'also', 'nice', 'basic', 'introduction', 'world', 'quantum', 'physics', 'particle', 'theory', 'concept', 'ten', 'dimensional', 'universe', 'Consider', 'evangelization', 'higher', 'math']",The Theory of Everything
1019473,A91BK8S5QH98K,B000I8OMDU,CelticWomanFanPiano,"[1, 2]","This is a very interesting movie about a physicist, who is reaching the end stages of his life, trying to finish the proof of everything.  The movie brings out a lot of scientific facts which are very fascinating (especially to a Math major like me!) and really  makes one think about the universe and God and creation.  The actor portraying the physicist did an excellent job of his role.  What makes the film lack substance is the more or less deflating ending and the lead character being so flat.  The movie gave him several close-ups of his face in an attempt to show his emotions but his face never changed all throughout the entire film.  He always seems to be in a perpetual smile.  So, bear in mind that it is an independent film, and so not as well done as Hollywood films.  But at the same time, dwelling on a more interesting topic than found in typical Hollywood shows.",4,"Interesting plot line, poor casting.",1214870400,"07 1, 2008",2008,882,"['very', 'interesting', 'movie', 'physicist', 'who', 'reaching', 'end', 'stages', 'life', 'trying', 'finish', 'proof', 'everything', 'movie', 'out', 'lot', 'scientific', 'facts', 'are', 'very', 'fascinating', 'especially', 'Math', 'major', 'really', 'one', 'think', 'universe', 'God', 'creation', 'actor', 'portraying', 'physicist', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'role', 'What', 'film', 'lack', 'substance', 'more', 'less', 'deflating', 'ending', 'lead', 'character', 'being', 'so', 'flat', 'movie', 'gave', 'several', 'close-ups', 'face', 'attempt', 'show', 'emotions', 'face', 'never', 'changed', 'entire', 'film', 'always', 'be', 'perpetual', 'smile', 'So', 'bear', 'mind', 'independent', 'film', 'so', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'same', 'time', 'dwelling', 'more', 'interesting', 'topic', 'found', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'shows']",The Theory of Everything

And yes, it's true that this was a low-budget Christian movie, but...It was also very well done and well acted and completely engaging. And, unlike some of the other Christian flicks I've seen (such as the ""Left Behind"" movie), you don't have to check your intellect at the door to immerse yourself in the movie.It's a nice blending of quantum physics and metaphysics and the things of God. (And lead character ""Gene"" offered the best explanation of ten dimensions that I've ever seen on screen.) The religious message was certainly present but it didn't hit you over the head repeatedly with a 20-pound sledge hammer, as some of this genre like to do.On a different note, it was also an interesting keyhole peek at what can happen when grief takes over and runs away with our lives. And, it also presented a realistic portrayal of our judicial systems' clumsy and inept handling of elder case issues. Ick.And best of all, there was no foul language, no violence, pornography, or exploding cars. Perhaps that's the reason this well-written, small-budget flick hasn't sold a kajillion copies.",5,"metaphysics and quantum physics come together, in one tasty bite!",1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,1205,"['reviewer', 'stated', 'lead', 'actor', 'was', 'also', 'film', 'director', 'producer', 'did', 'fine', 'fine', 'job', 'yes', 'true', 'was', 'low-budget', 'Christian', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'acted', 'completely', 'engaging', 'other', 'Christian', 'flicks', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'such', 'Left', 'Behind', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'check', 'intellect', 'door', 'immerse', 'movie.It', 'nice', 'blending', 'quantum', 'physics', 'metaphysics', 'things', 'God', 'lead', 'character', 'Gene', 'offered', 'best', 'explanation', 'ten', 'dimensions', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'screen', 'religious', 'message', 'was', 'certainly', 'present', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'head', 'repeatedly', '20-pound', 'sledge', 'hammer', 'genre', 'do.On', 'different', 'note', 'was', 'also', 'interesting', 'keyhole', 'peek', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'grief', 'runs', 'away', 'lives', 'also', 'presented', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'judicial', 'systems', 'clumsy', 'inept', 'handling', 'elder', 'case', 'issues', 'Ick.And', 'best', 'was', 'foul', 'language', 'violence', 'pornography', 'exploding', 'cars', 'Perhaps', 'reason', 'well-written', 'small-budget', 'flick', ""n't"", 'sold', 'kajillion', 'copies']",The Theory of Everything
