He should have had some sense, instead he played the family's fool.

944814,A2BH2BDFIDZY3K,B000BM7Z3W,"Skyy Sutton ""skyy777""","[21, 23]","I viewed this film with my husband and a Christian friend.  We kept stopping the film and discussing various scenes.  I am not certain what the director had in mind.  There were a number of things wrong regarding Christian behavior and mindsets.  The leading lady is looking for a Christian husband, and along the journey, she seeks advice from two coworkers who are clearly entrenched in worldly values--a young promiscuous woman and a gay man.  Pamela's appearance is that of a worldly woman who is trying to attract men by the way she dresses and walks.  (In one scene, she is stating to Jordan that she wants a man who loves Jesus, but she's wearing a tight, green shirt with her cleavage all in his face).  Pamela's parents' behavior and speech do not ring true for a couple who are suppose to be Christians.  The grandfather was a buffoon, and this character could have been omitted from the story.  The icing on the cake is the pastor clearly giving Pamela the wrong advice, and then giving out the same jacked-up advice to Jordan, basically telling them that as long as they feel it's true love, it's okay.  What about Jordan's wife, a tragic alcoholic who was clearly crying out for love and attention?  A true Christian--whether a pastor, friend, teacher, etc.--would have advised Pamela and Jordan to end the relationship.  I plan to use this film as a teaching tool for young Christian women--it is an example of what Christian behavior is not, and should encourage an in-depth discussion on correct Christian behavior and relationships as given in the Bible--not according to what man says.",3,"this story needs work, but can be used as a teaching tool",1171238400,"02 12, 2007",2007,1603,"['viewed', 'film', 'husband', 'Christian', 'friend', 'kept', 'stopping', 'film', 'discussing', 'various', 'scenes', 'am', 'not', 'certain', 'what', 'director', 'had', 'mind', 'were', 'number', 'things', 'wrong', 'regarding', 'Christian', 'behavior', 'mindsets', 'leading', 'lady', 'looking', 'Christian', 'husband', 'journey', 'advice', 'two', 'coworkers', 'who', 'are', 'clearly', 'entrenched', 'worldly', 'values', 'young', 'promiscuous', 'woman', 'gay', 'man', 'Pamela', 'appearance', 'worldly', 'woman', 'who', 'trying', 'attract', 'men', 'way', 'walks', 'one', 'scene', 'stating', 'Jordan', 'man', 'who', 'Jesus', 'wearing', 'tight', 'green', 'shirt', 'cleavage', 'face', 'Pamela', 'parents', 'behavior', 'speech', 'do', 'not', 'ring', 'true', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'suppose', 'be', 'Christians', 'grandfather', 'was', 'buffoon', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'omitted', 'story', 'icing', 'cake', 'pastor', 'clearly', 'giving', 'Pamela', 'wrong', 'advice', 'then', 'giving', 'out', 'same', 'jacked-up', 'advice', 'Jordan', 'basically', 'telling', 'as', 'long', 'feel', 'true', 'love', 'okay', 'What', 'Jordan', 'wife', 'tragic', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'was', 'clearly', 'crying', 'out', 'love', 'attention', 'true', 'Christian', 'pastor', 'friend', 'teacher', 'etc.', 'would', 'have', 'advised', 'Pamela', 'Jordan', 'end', 'relationship', 'plan', 'use', 'film', 'teaching', 'tool', 'young', 'Christian', 'women', 'example', 'what', 'Christian', 'behavior', 'not', 'should', 'encourage', 'in-depth', 'discussion', 'correct', 'Christian', 'behavior', 'relationships', 'given', 'Bible', 'not', 'according', 'what', 'man']",N/A
