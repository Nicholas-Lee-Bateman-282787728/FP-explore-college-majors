718469,A1PMDTYRAIPGXW,B00006JMQ4,Adam P Boots,"[1, 1]","This was an interesting flick that tells the tale of growing up in a catholic school.  It uses an interesting method of storytelling, as it interweaves cartooning and live action drama to tell the story of two boys growing up, causing mischief, and just being boys.The animation is done by McFarlane Studios, who, if you don't know, produces/produced the cartoon series Spawn.  Personally, I didn't really appreciate the animation scenes as much as I could have because I almost felt they took away from the drama of the movie, but the QUALITY of the animation was still top notch.The story was interesting, at the very least, humorous at times, tense at times, and even sad at times.  It's a good film to watch, but I don't know if I'd recommend it to everyone to buy.  The acting is great in this one, with standout performances by Jodie Foster and Vincent D'Onoforio (sp).As I said, I don't think I'd recommend this film to EVERYONE to buy, but I enjoyed it and it was well worth the $8 I paid for it, though I wouldn't give it &quot;rave&quot; reviews either.",4,"Charming, but unexpected",1076371200,"02 10, 2004",2004,1063,"['was', 'interesting', 'flick', 'tale', 'growing', 'up', 'catholic', 'school', 'interesting', 'method', 'storytelling', 'cartooning', 'live', 'action', 'drama', 'tell', 'story', 'two', 'boys', 'growing', 'up', 'causing', 'mischief', 'just', 'being', 'boys.The', 'animation', 'done', 'McFarlane', 'Studios', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'produces/produced', 'cartoon', 'series', 'Spawn', 'Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'appreciate', 'animation', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'almost', 'felt', 'took', 'away', 'drama', 'movie', 'QUALITY', 'animation', 'was', 'still', 'top', 'notch.The', 'story', 'was', 'interesting', 'very', 'least', 'humorous', 'times', 'tense', 'times', 'even', 'sad', 'times', 'good', 'film', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'everyone', 'buy', 'acting', 'great', 'one', 'standout', 'performances', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Vincent', ""D'Onoforio"", 'sp', '.As', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'film', 'EVERYONE', 'buy', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'well', '8', 'paid', 'would', ""n't"", 'give', 'quot', 'rave', 'quot']",N/A

Basically, this is a story of teen angst done with the charm of adolescence kept squarely in mind.  The cast is young and impressionable and they come across with convictions beyond their years, especially Kieran Culkin, who had a stellar year (with this and `Igby Goes Down').  Hirsch leads the film with admirable conviction, although he is one of my least favorite in the cast.

718472,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00006JMQ4,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[1, 1]","Peter Care brilliantly adapts Chris Fuhrman's story of four alter boys relationships with one another and those around them.  These four boys, Francis (Emile Hirsch), Tim (Kieran Culkin), Wade (Jake Richardson) and Joey (Tyler Long), are attending a Catholic school in the 1960's.  The boys have a deep hatred or at least lost respect for Catholicism and especially for their teacher Sister Assumpta (Jodie Foster) who rules the boys, and the rest of her class, with an iron fist.  In order to escape the problems in their lives the boys burry themselves in comic books, more specifically their own comic book `The Atomic Trinity'.As the boys reach that pivotal age of fourteen they are now faced with the whole girl issue and this hits Francis hard in the form of Margie (Jena Malone).  Margie though has a dark secret, a secret that in itself causes a riff to form between the four boys, most notably between best friends Francis and Tim.  Francis is the more nave of the boys, the more sheltered while Tim is the chief rebel, the boy who devises the plots and convinces the others to follow him.  By plots I mean foolish boy things.  One of these plots involves smuggling a cougar out of the state zoo in an attempt to frighten Sister Assumpta.  But before they can carry out this plan they must mend their friendship, not only with each other but also with Margie.`The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys' is a brilliant coming of age story that touches deeply upon the affect that school, pressure, sexuality and religion can have on young teenagers.  The entire cast is spectacular here, particularly Jena Malone and Kieran Culkin (who had just a killer year in 2002), but Jodie Foster is also wonderful as the hated `Nunzilla' or Sister Assumpta and Vincent D'Onofrio is great as Father Casey, a role much different than anything I've seen him do recently.  Another highlight is the inclusion of the boys comic `The Atomic Trinity' that runs parallel with the events taking place in order to fully tell the whole story, letting us delve inside the mind of Francis and see how he relates things to his life.This is a great film, one I truly enjoyed and one that I'm sure many others will enjoy as well.  It's nice to finally see young talented actors getting scripts with some meat, something for them to work with and not the same old Freddy Prince Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar crap that we see every week.

718474,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00006JMQ4,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[6, 9]","""Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"" is a surprisingly balanced, well-made movie with excellent acting and scripts. It also strikes a good balance between sniggering mischief and mature themes, which is pretty appropriate for a coming-of-age story. It's not an easy movie to watch, but it is certainly a compelling and sometimes funny one.It takes place in the 1960s, at a Catholic school in an ordinary little town. A small group of the boys there write and illustrate a comic book, with themselves as superhumans who battle an evil one-legged nun named Nunzilla -- who strongly resembles their teacher, the stern Sister Assumpta (Jodie Foster).  Sister Assumpta knows about their growing rebellion and overflowing hormones, and in her efforts to care for her ""children,"" she keeps trying to help them, even if they despise her for it.What's more, Francis (Emile Hirsch) has fallen in love with Margie Flynn, a pretty young girl with a dark secret in her past. The boys continue their escapades, including stealing a statue of Saint Agatha, continuing their comic book (""The Atomic Trinity""), and finally plotting to smuggle a very dangerous animal out of the zoo.At first glance one might be inclined to see ""Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"" as having a bad attitude towards Catholicism. But the bad attitude seems to be mainly that of the boys (and we already kneew they had a bad attitude) towards nuns and priests; the tone of the moviemakers towards Father Casey and Sister Assumpta is fair and pretty good. Father Casey in particular is likeable, a chain-smoking priest with a cursing habit and a warm personality, who knows when to be stern.Emile Hirsch and the always-amazing Kieran Culkin are good as best friends Francis and Tim. Even teir faces are a bit like an angel and a good-natured imp; Hirsch is a relatively naive boy who is just learning about the messiness of being a man, and Culkin is a mischief-maker with a good heart and no survival instincts. Tim deals with his family strife by being reckless, a realistic response. Jena Malone has the right mix of sweetness and sadness as Margie. Jodie Foster (who also produced the film) has a similar mix of sternness and kindness; you get the feeling that Sister Assumpta could be a real friend to the boys if they wanted it like that. And Vincent D'Onofrio is cheerily likeable as Father Casey.The direction is very good, especially since the real-life stuff is regularly interrupted by the over-the-top comic book adventures. Some of the scenes are outrageously funny, like when the statue of Saint Agatha dangles precariously over the unsuspecting Father Casey. And some are poignant without a word, like when Tim runs away from Margie after learning her secret. This definitely isn't a kids' movie; there is some smutty content between Margie and Francis, a discussion about incest (one of the characters), and a lot of dirty jokes.This is not a feel-good movie, but it may be the most vivid coming-of-age movie in many years. Though not perfect, it's an intriguing movie that will probably remain a cult classic.

718476,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00006JMQ4,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","THE DANGEROUS LIFE OF ALTAR BOYS is not a film about the current Catholic controversies, so don't let the title steer you away from a throughly fine piece of movie making.  As endlessly outlined in the other reviews, ALTAR BOYS is a story of how young boys deal with the world both within their narrow space of a small town Catholic school and neighborhood and with the greater obstacles of the world outside their sphere of influence.  The film introduces a quartet of lads who seem to be heading us toward a hilarious sequence of misadventures revolving around their shared view of Sister Assumpta and the rigidity of life inside the parochial classroom.  The manner in which these grand plans begin to misfire introduces metaphors of the rite of passage for men, the rise of testosterone effects, the discovery that all is not what it appears to be, and that even plots of seemingly innocent mischief can have life-altering consequences.  The story is enhanced by the director's choice to turn the screen into a comic book world when the visions of the boys grow larger than life.  And no, this is not the usual obnoxious interference of animated characters pasted on the real life screen of breathing people.  This is cinematic witchcraft at its finest.  The actors are uniformly excellent - Emile Hirsch, Kieran Culkin, Jena Malone, Jody Foster, Vincent D'Onofrio, et al - and ably traverse the tightrope from comedy to tragedy.

Set in the 70's (featuring many cool 70's haircuts) in small town Georgia, the story focuses on Francis, a 14-year-old dreamer and troublemaker. He and his pals, Tim, Wade, and Joey cope with life under the oppressive rule of one-legged nun Sister Assumpta (Jodie Foster) at the Puritan Christian high school they're unfortunate enough to attend.One of their methods of escape is the `The Atomic Trinity' comic book. Each of them have their own character with superpowers (such as The Muscle, Captain Asskicker and Skeleton Boy), battling against the tyrannical regime of Nunzilla/Pegleg (a gross caricature of Sister Assumpta). These fantasy stories make up the terrific animated sequences of the film. The cool thing is that they are not so totally removed from the reality of Francis, Tim, Wade and Joey.The boys soon find their way into a lot of trouble though. After stealing the school's nun statue mascot the quartet plan to steal a cougar from the zoo and put in Sister Assumpta's office. A mad plan yes, but their determination and invention behind it is very clever.Some scenes of the film are very emotional, so if you have soft spot you'll find it tough to get through the scene where Tim finds a dying dog by the side of the road or Francis reading a poem at the funeral.Francis' relationship with Margie (the very cute Jenna Malone) also takes many curious and unique turns.

Woolfork ""wolfprime""","[3, 3]","I don't think I'll do the film justice, but here goes:The young cast in this film is very talented and give great effort in bringing their characters to life.  They do an especially good job depicting the obstacles of adolescence. The experimenting with drugs and alcohol, friendship and trust, love and sex for the first times in their lives, were protrayed very realistically. Sometimes the dispositions of the characters seemed off beat, but it was an exaggeration needed to impress the gravity of the scene. Kieran Culkin as Tim is passionate in his love of language and words if tragically flawed. The animated intermissions serve as a look into Emile Hirsch's / Francis' head, translating what happens around him into something he can relate to and digest through his imagination and love of comics. Jena Malone has a great performance as Margie and is vaguely reminiscent of Kirsten Dunst in The Virgin Suicides for some reason. As a coming of age movie though, this one is MUCH better. Malone also reminded me of a young Natalie Portman in Beautiful Girls.  She has a 'thing' about her, a hint that says she's destined for greatness. What a talent. Jodie Foster is Jodie Foster. She  and Vincent D'Onofiro do a great job, but the adults in the movie serve mostly as placeholders.If you are a fan of bang up performances in coming of ages movies, this one has the potential to replace your current favorite. This movie resonated with me personally because in a offhanded way that WAS me and my friends. We had the same love of comics and disregard for authority.

But this film has very little to do with altar boys' experiences performing their duties in on Sunday.Set in a Catholic School with an amazing performance by (I couln't believe it when I saw it) Jodie Foster as a nun-from-hell; this story follows the fantasies and thoughts of boys at an age when anything seems possible. But this is NOT just another coming-of-age story of choices and change.Two best friends are the main characters, while Foster provides a face to an important part of their fantasy in the boys' antics and mysteries. What an neat view into the minds of not just these characters, but in understanding what twists of fate may make the difference between the troubled teen and the stand-out young man.Culkin's acting is far superior to anything his brother ever tried and deserves commendation, not just because he must follow in the confused footsteps of his older brother. Culkin plays this character to the edge and shows the audience that he is not just another wannabe. Watching this gifted actor experiment and grow as a fine thespian will be a delight.The vehicle for discovering the inner workings of the boys is an extrodinary film technique and blends so well into the storyline that it cannot be explained without ruining the film for the viewer. Suffice it to say, an almost biblical tale of good vs. evil climaxes in the minds and actions of the kids and their childhood antics.The TRUE self image of the youngsters could never be shown or acted without the help of pencil to paper and the magic of cinema.The DVD version of this film gives us a wonderful glimpse into the vision of the producers and director as well as an intriguing breakdown of a pivotal scene in the film.

718484,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00006JMQ4,Matthew Horner,"[6, 6]","&#147;The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys&#148; is an odd movie for several reasons. It mixes animation with live action, and it is the antithesis of the typical American movie about teenagers. These characters deal with sex and drugs more like very young adults than overgrown kids, While this viewpoint may be a little surprising to some viewers, it makes these teens more believable and memorable.Tim and Francis [Kieran Culkin and Emile Hirsch] are best friends. Growing up in a small, Middle American city, They attend a Catholic school and act as alter boys at the local cathedral. Bright, rebellious and bored, they are constantly looking for ways to get into trouble. With other friends, they create a comic book called the Atomic Trinity. The book&#146;s heroes are their alter egos, and the villain is modeled after the school&#146;s dreaded Sister Assumpta [Jodie Foster]. When the Sister discovers the book, which is quite sacrilegious, there is hell to pay. Like all good rebels, the boys vow revenge. Meanwhile, Francis falls in love with Margie Flynn [Jena Malone], a girl with a terrible secret which will exact a terrible toll on Francis and Tim&#146;s friendship.Weaknesses in the script mar an otherwise interesting coming-of-age tale. In particular, the animation sequences get in the way of the narrative towards the end. While they vividly illustrate the boys&#146; fantasy world, they would have been more effective had they been briefer and more to the point.A highlight is the young cast. Culkin, Hirsch and Malone are three of the best teenage actors around, and it is treat to see them together in the same movie.While it rarely reaches the heights to which it aspires dramatically, &#147;The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys&#148; is one of the better recent movies about young people and their problems.

Smith,"[1, 1]","I watched this on a recommendation from a friend, not really knowing anything about it going in, except that it was based on the novel by the late Chris Fuhrman. I sort of expected a routine coming-of-age story -- but while it focuses on a small group of adolescent Catholic schoolboys (and one girl) growing up in Savannah in the 1970s, it's anything but routine. Francis Doyle (Emile Hirsch, a newcomer to me) and Tim Sullivan (Kieran Culkin, who is a better actor than his better-known brother) are struggling with their hormones and boredom and the discipline meted out by an especially strict nun (Jodie Foster, who nicely underplays the role). Francis is in love for the first time with Margie Flynn (Jena Malone), who seems as innocent and tentative as he is -- but she has a secret, and another secret within that, both of which she eventually shares with Francis. Who finally has to share his burden and tells Tim, who can't quite keep his mouth shut, either. Francis is a talented artist and the four friends contribute plots and characters to an ongoing superhero comic book Francis draws. (Sister Assumpta, of course, is ""Nunzilla,"" the villain of the piece.) The live action is interspersed with the boys' animated alter egos, which is an interesting way of getting the viewer inside their heads and emotions. The third plotline involves a cougar kept at a small zoo, which becomes the focus of an extreme prank planned against Sister Assumpta -- but which (not unexpectedly) ends in extreme tragedy. The film starts off lightheartedly, gradually becoming darker and more serious as the various plotlines progress. The acting is first-rate, especially considering Foster and Vincent D'Onofrio (as Father Casey, also underplaying his few scenes) are the only adults with more than a single line. As an aside, Jodie Foster was forty years old here but she looks no more than twenty-five. Amazing.

718487,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00006JMQ4,Reviewer,"[2, 2]","Context is basically what separates one coming-of-age story from another, as well as the way it's presented; the filmmaker's ability to make that all important connection with the audience.  Due in no small part to some strong performances, ""The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys,"" directed by Peter Care, is a successful and worthwhile-- even significant-- addition to the genre.  Though it works within specific parameters (the subjects are students at a Catholic school), most importantly, the film taps deeply into the internal angst experienced by the individuals who are the focus of Care's incisive study, and the way in which their feelings are externalized in the film offers a satisfying examination of the human condition at a particularly sensitive juncture of life.Francis Doyle (Emile Hirsch) is fourteen and in the throes of that inescapable period of change through which we all must pass on the way to becoming who we are as adults.  A pupa encased in the cocoon of youth, Francis is straining against that protective shell, attempting to break through into manhood.  His family environment is strict, the routine of his life (which includes being an altar boy) is rigid, and puberty is having it's way with him.  Adding to his inner conflict, as well, is the fact that his best friend, Tim Sullivan (Kieran Culkin), is continually engaging in exploits that transcend mischief to the point of being outright foolish and dangerous; daring deeds in which Francis must necessarily take part, in keeping with their own established caste and as Tim's confrere in this business of probing life's eternal mysteries.  Not to mention, too, that Francis has discovered something else, quite on his own.  And her name is Margie Flynn (Jena Malone).Luckily (perhaps), Francis manages to vent his pent up frustrations and confusion creatively, through animation.  With his friends Joey and Wade (Tyler Long, Jake Richardson), he has created a comic book, ""Atomic Trinity,"" which features four outcast teenaged boys endowed with superpowers (Tim has been included as ""editor"").  And to channel their hormonal driven rebellion against authority and structure, they have chosen their teacher, Sister Assumpta (Jodie Foster), as their target, for in their eyes she personifies all that is wrong with their world.  Assigning her the role of Source Of All That Is Bad, she emerges as ""Nun-zilla"" in their comic, this haven to which they can flee and momentarily escape the realities of a world they haven't as yet figured out.  What they don't realize is that Tim is about to involve them in a scheme which, if effected, is going to change their lives forever.  And that ""safe haven"" of theirs may soon be a thing of the past.Learning to navigate the rapids of life is no easy task, and director Care treats his subject accordingly, with a sensitive and serious rendering of the material (the screenplay was written by Jeff Stockwell and Michael Petroni, adapted from the book by Chris Fuhrman).  Care succeeds by avoiding the kind of embarrassing frivolity that is too often associated with a film of this nature.  He maintains credibility at every turn, making the story believable by keeping it on the stage of reality, rather than allowing it to wander into the theater of the absurd.  The way he presents the relationship between Francis and Margie, for instance, is entirely convincing in the way they tentatively explore their budding sexuality together, rather than lurching ahead with seemingly sudden and inexplicable knowledge and enlightenment.  Their discoveries come more from reaction than action, and the result is a very honest and genuine depiction of the situation.  And Care uses this approach consistently throughout the film, which goes far in making it a thoroughly thought provoking drama.As Francis, young Hirsch gives a commanding performance, exhibiting a maturity and grasp of the character that is far beyond his years.  There is a complexity to Francis that demands a tremendous emotional range to be convincing, and Hirsch delivers it all and then some, with a portrayal of astounding depth.  Here, in his motion picture debut, he emerges as one of the finest young actors in the business today.Jena Malone also makes a substantial impact with her acute portrayal of Margie, successfully conveying the tortured soul of this young girl who must endure a most distressing secret.  There are moments in which the pain derived from her inner turmoil is almost tangible; and that about sums up the quality of her performance here.Displaying yet another side of the coin is Kieran Culkin, who in Tim creates a character who, unlike the others, internalizes his adolescent discord while outwardly manifesting an almost aloof disdain for caution in all things.  We're given indications and a glimpse into the strife existing within his home and family, and it's enough to make us aware of the source of his discontent.  It's a solid performance, though he fails to make any real connection with the audience, most likely due to the fact that Tim is quite simply not an easy character to embrace.The most subtle and understated performance in the film is turned in by Jodie Foster, who though she lacks enough screen time to adequately develop her character nevertheless manages to succinctly reveal exactly who she is and what she's about.  She is stern, and obviously a disciplinarian; but though her methods may be too straightforward, even to the point of seeming malicious, she is not, and is far from being the monster ""Nun-zilla"" depicted in ""Atomic Trinity.""  On the contrary, she has a good heart and sincerely wants only to instruct her students in ways that will lead them to a fulfilling life.  There is obviously more to Sister Assumpta's story, but the focus of the film must necessarily remain elsewhere, and we are left to infer what we may.A thoughtful, emotionally involving film, ""The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"" offers a viable perspective on the rigorous undertaking known as ""growing up.""",4,Growing Up Is Hard To Do,1038960000,"12 4, 2002",2002,6029,"['Context', 'basically',

Talk about contradictory and opposing forces, this film hits you right between the eyes. Produced by Jodie Foster and Meg Lefauve who seek projects that push for a universal truth, this production certainly doesn't disappoint.  It's a tender love affair underlying the bottled energy, hormone driven youngsters, looking to unleash on a world not yet known to them.A nun, Sister Assumpta (Jodie Foster), in her unswerving dedication, tries to convince her pupils that denial and self-discipline here on earth, assures their divine salvation.  The boys see her as a fiendish Church authority and create a comic book that defiles her and the church.  Animated sequences of their comic book art are shown that reveals the boys' perception of their own lives.  This provides an ingenious touch of insight into their thought processes.  The girls are quieter, but their emotions run no less deeply; just in a different way.  One of them, Margie (Jenna Malone), has a dark secret that she dares not reveal, but feels she must when she falls in love with Francis (Emile Hirsch).It is scary, fascinating, disturbing, wonderful, and an inescapable peek into reality, and the casting and acting are incredible; it's as good as it gets.

718489,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00006JMQ4,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 3]","The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys (Peter Care, 2002)I wanted to hate this movie. And for the first half, I did a pretty good job. There's just something about any film touched by a member of the Culkin clan (the last movie I remember seeing with a Culkin in it that I really liked was Jacob's Ladder) that manages to rub me the wrong way; it's like someone took a whole slew of Albert Brooks clones and put them into a single family. By the end of this, however, I admit I was hooked.The story centers on Francis Doyle (Lords of Dogtown's Emile Hirsch) and Tim Sullivan (Kieran Culkin), two Catholic-school students who are part of a small collective of artists working on a comic book called The Atomic Trio. The comic book, which is pretty nasty by any standards, is considered positively obscene by the teachers, when they discover it, in no small part because one of the villains is modeled after Sister Assumpta (Jodie Foster). When she gets hold of the thing, she takes it to the headmaster, Father Casey (Voncent D'Onofrio), whose boys-will-be-boys attitude doesn't make her terribly happy. Not that that matters to the kids, who retaliate by planning the biggest prank the school's ever seen. Of course, they hold the previous record, having nicked a statue from the school's bell tower and hidden it in a nearby mausoleum, which has become the group's de facto clubhouse. Everything gets more complex when Francis finds himself attracted to fellow student Margie Flynn (Jena Malone of the forthcoming The Ruins).About the best thing I can say about the first half of the film is that it's not terrible. It's competently done, but it's all setup, and it's not very interesting setup at that. Once they start planning their harebrained prank, however, things pick up nicely, and we finally start getting a feeling for these characters. Screenwriters Jeff Stockwell and Michael Petroni open the storyline up a bit, introducing us to a more interesting batch of folks than we've met previously (namely Margie's very off-the-wall family, who despite getting almost no screen time steal the show) and giving us a lot more insight into most of the characters we already know. The odd exception is Sister Assumpta, who remains as much a two-dimensional villain as the artistic renderings of her done by her students.In the end, it's not bad, but it could have been a great deal better, and the second half is proof of that. ** ",2,Not bad once it gets going.,1199318400,"01 3, 2008",2008,2428,"['Dangerous', 'Lives', 'Altar', 'Boys', 'Peter', 'Care', '2002', 'wanted', 'hate', 'movie', 'first', 'half', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'just', 'something', 'film', 'touched', 'member', 'Culkin', 'clan', 'last', 'movie', 'remember', 'seeing', 'Culkin', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'rub', 'wrong', 'way', 'someone', 'took', 'whole', 'slew', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'clones', 'put', 'single', 'family', 'end', 'however', 'admit', 'was', 'hooked.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Francis', 'Doyle', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Tim', 'Sullivan', 'Kieran', 'Culkin', 'two', 'Catholic-school', 'students', 'who', 'are', 'part', 'small', 'collective', 'artists', 'working', 'comic', 'book', 'called', 'Atomic', 'Trio', 'comic', 'book', 'pretty', 'nasty', 'standards', 'considered', 'positively', 'obscene', 'teachers', 'when', 'discover', 'small', 'part', 'one', 'villains', 'modeled', 'Sister', 'Assumpta', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'When', 'hold', 'thing', 'headmaster', 'Father', 'Casey', 'Voncent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'boys-will-be-boys', 'attitude', ""n't"", 'make', 'terribly', 'happy', 'Not', 'matters', 'kids', 'who', 'retaliate', 'planning', 'biggest', 'prank', 'school', 'ever', 'seen', 'course', 'hold', 'previous', 'record', 'having', 'nicked', 'statue', 'school', 'bell', 'tower', 'hidden', 'nearby', 'mausoleum', 'become', 'group', 'de', 'facto', 'clubhouse', 'Everything', 'more', 'complex', 'when', 'Francis', 'attracted', 'fellow', 'student', 'Margie', 'Flynn', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'forthcoming', 'Ruins', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'not', 'terrible', 'competently', 'done', 'setup', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'setup', 'Once', 'start', 'planning', 'harebrained', 'prank', 'however', 'things', 'pick', 'up', 'nicely', 'finally', 'start', 'getting', 'feeling', 'characters', 'Screenwriters', 'Jeff', 'Stockwell', 'Michael', 'Petroni', 'open', 'storyline', 'up', 'bit', 'introducing', 'more', 'interesting', 'batch', 'folks', ""'ve"", 'met', 'previously', 'namely', 'Margie', 'very', 'off-the-wall', 'family', 'who', 'getting', 'almost', 'screen', 'time', 'steal', 'show', 'giving', 'lot', 'more', 'insight', 'most', 'characters', 'already', 'know', 'odd', 'exception', 'Sister', 'Assumpta', 'who', 'as', 'much', 'two-dimensional', 'villain', 'artistic', 'renderings', 'done', 'students.In', 'end', 'not', 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'deal', 'better', 'second', 'half', 'proof', '**']",N/A
718490,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00006JMQ4,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","""The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"" is NOT, as you might expect, a film about predatory priests, but rather a slice-of-life tale about four malcontent Catholic schoolboys who spend most of their free time devising preposterously elaborate and life-threatening practical jokes to play on the faculty members of their school.As a coming-of-age drama, the film is fairly conventional in its plotting - i.e. young boys, in their rebellion against the uncomprehending adult world, experiment with drugs, first love, sex and general rule breaking - although there is a tricky and touchy incest-related subplot that is handled with a certain amount of delicacy and sensitivity.  The highlight of the movie is the outstanding performances delivered by youngsters Emile Hirsch, Kieran Culkin and Jena Malone, whom you might remember as the young Jodie Foster in ""Contact.""  In fact, Foster herself appears in this film (in addition to co-producing it) as the uptight nun, Sister Assumpta.  Unfortunately, her character is probably the least well developed one in the film, a fact that seems more obvious than it otherwise might if an actress of Foster's caliber were not playing the part.The film also displays a nice feeling for its early-70's setting and does a good job capturing the way young people actually speak and communicate (the cast members have their nonverbal expressions and gestures down beautifully as well).  Working from the novel by Chris Fuhrman, screenwriters Jeff Stockwell and Michael Petroni, along with director Peter Care, interrupt the live action at regular intervals to provide animated sequences that are ostensibly derived from the anarchic superhero comic book on which the gifted boys are collaborating.  We know that these sequences are intended to provide a kind of fantasy alternate universe for these troubled kids who seem to find no meaning in the restricted world of religion and rules in which they find themselves, but the fact is that these sections of the film, not very creative in themselves, merely serve to thrust us out of the story at crucial moments.""The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"" is an odd and somewhat misleading title for this film, since most of the ""danger"" these boys face is, primarily, a product of their own stupidity and not of their religious upbringing.  Indeed, the religious figures in the film are mainly cranky and/or ineffectual, not really dangerous.

There is a tendency in the beginning to show that these boys are rather ""charmed"", which makes it that much more startling when their luck runs out in a rather grusome manner.  Vincent D'Onofrio does a fine job playing the priest who is quite willing to endure the misbehavior of the boys, until he gets an inside look of how they see him.  Then, he takes a more serious tone, searching for where he went wrong with the lads?  While not trying to give away the ending, the ""loss"" isn't really dealt with in a satisfying way.  One would have hoped that a stronger moral character developed as a result, rather than the launching of what might have been in that age the same as becoming a rock star today. There was a feeling that the character suffered, yes, but failed to ""grow"".This movie will not fail to entertain.  It's quite believable.

718492,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B00006JMQ4,Shashank Tripathi,"[10, 11]","Interesting theme: a group of four boys who go to a Catholic school are tired of squirming under the unflinching tyranny of Nun-zilla, their rigorous nun played by Jodie Foster.With whom they cope by expressing their frustrations through comic-book sketches and imagining themselves as superheroes. The film uses this excuse to smoosh in some fascinating animation sequences illustrating emotional aspects of the story through the eyes of these kids.This includes several sub-plots and sub-sub-plots: first romances, coming of age, friendship, control versus freedom, even hints of touchy issues like pedophilia (although no, there is nothing creepy actually manifested), etc.The characters are convincing, and the performances are quite taut all round, so I've had a hard time putting an exact pulse on what the problem is with Altar Boys, because I liked many of the big picture things about it. Perhaps the film took off in too many directions at once. In bringing up all these themes and tropes, several topics are introduced and then frittered away for lack of time. Others are dwelled upon longer than they should have.Yet, on the whole, Altar Boys works well as a well-done tale of baffled adolescents for whom imagination is not merely a dangerous diversion feared by conservative religious folk, but a veritable cathartic tool.One minor annoyance with the DVD: the sound of dialogue is about 2 million decibels lower than the sound of the soundtrack that accompanies the animation interludes.Recommended rental.",4,"ANGST, ADVENTURE, ANIMATION: COMPETENT BUT SCATTERED BLEND",1095120000,"09 14, 2004",2004,1520,"['Interesting', 'theme', 'group', 'four', 'boys', 'who', 'go', 'Catholic', 'school', 'are', 'tired', 'squirming', 'unflinching', 'tyranny', 'Nun-zilla', 'rigorous', 'nun', 'played', 'Jodie', 'Foster.With', 'whom', 'cope', 'expressing', 'frustrations', 'comic-book', 'sketches', 'imagining', 'superheroes', 'film', 'excuse', 'smoosh', 'fascinating', 'animation', 'sequences', 'illustrating', 'emotional', 'aspects', 'story', 'eyes', 'kids.This', 'several', 'sub-plots', 'sub-sub-plots', 'first', 'romances', 'coming', 'age', 'friendship', 'control', 'versus', 'freedom', 'even', 'hints', 'touchy', 'issues', 'pedophilia', 'nothing', 'creepy', 'actually', 'manifested', 'etc.The', 'characters', 'are', 'convincing', 'performances', 'are', 'quite', 'taut', 'round', ""'ve"", 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'putting', 'exact', 'pulse', 'what', 'problem', 'Altar', 'Boys', 'liked', 'many', 'big', 'picture', 'things', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'took', 'off', 'too', 'many', 'directions', 'once', 'bringing', 'up', 'themes', 'tropes', 'several', 'topics', 'are', 'introduced', 'then', 'frittered', 'away', 'lack', 'time', 'Others', 'are', 'dwelled', 'longer', 'should', 'have.Yet', 'whole', 'Altar', 'Boys', 'well', 'well-done', 'tale', 'baffled', 'adolescents', 'whom', 'imagination', 'not', 'merely', 'dangerous', 'diversion', 'feared', 'conservative', 'religious', 'folk', 'veritable', 'cathartic', 'tool.One', 'minor', 'annoyance', 'DVD', 'sound', 'dialogue', '2', 'million', 'decibels', 'lower', 'sound', 'soundtrack', 'animation', 'interludes.Recommended', 'rental']",N/A

Whenever the film grabs you, it takes a turn in the wrong direction. (Namely, the cougar incident. Which was ridiculous from the moment they started scheming and plotting.) I liked Kieran Culkin's character... it's just too bad we don't really learn anything about him...All in all, it was fair, seeing as how I didn't expect much walking into it. Script was kind of interesting... direction was nothing new or impressive, but still passable... cast was capable. Characters were just abysmally under-developed and, at times, extremely hokey and unbelievable. And cheezy, hokey dialogue doesn't help matters, either. ""When you look at me, I can't breathe.""One more thing... I kinda dug the marriage of animation and live-action in this film. It just seemed to work well enough here.",3,'Altar'ed States,1081123200,"04 5, 2004",2004,926,"['Yeah', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'movie', 'potential', 'just', 'blur', 'out', 'time', 'time', 'stupid', 'plot', 'twists', 'one', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'Whenever', 'film', 'grabs', 'turn', 'wrong', 'direction', 'Namely', 'cougar', 'incident', 'Which', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'moment', 'started', 'scheming', 'plotting', 'liked', 'Kieran', 'Culkin', 'character', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'learn', 'anything', 'was', 'fair', 'seeing', 'how', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'walking', 'Script', 'was', 'kind', 'interesting', 'direction', 'was', 'nothing', 'new', 'impressive', 'still', 'passable', 'cast', 'was', 'capable', 'Characters', 'were', 'just', 'abysmally', 'under-developed', 'times', 'extremely', 'hokey', 'unbelievable', 'cheezy', 'hokey', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'either', 'When', 'look', 'ca', ""n't"", 'breathe', 'One', 'more', 'thing', 'kinda', 'dug', 'marriage', 'animation', 'live-action', 'film', 'just', 'seemed', 'work', 'well', 'enough', 'here']",N/A

Freeman ""Zach""","[0, 0]","I read this book years ago and really didn't remember much of the specifics, but this film adaptation definitely captured the essence of the story itself. And that story is in the classic vein of the coming of age story (Stand By Me, etc.) The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys features four teenage (altar) boys in a Catholic school who see themselves as superheroes battling the evil ""Nunzilla"". This epic battle is portrayed throughout the film with brilliant cartoon animation.The film is really heartfelt and manages to provide a sensitive side to an angst-ridden time period in these kids lives. Jena Malone, Kieran Culkin, and Emile Hirsch star (along with Jodie Foster) and capture their characters so well that along with the realistic script and careful direction, the film as a whole is so realistic (even with the animation) that it will really resonate with audience members.The DVD contains tons of special features, including interviews, a featurette, biographies, and a lot more. Watching the interviews really helps fill in the story along the way and gives the audience a good idea of each character, and what the director and animator were going for as well.This film is definitely worth checking out.",4,Excellent adaptation of a moving novel,1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,1216,"['read', 'book', 'years', 'ago', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'much', 'specifics', 'film', 'adaptation', 'definitely', 'captured', 'essence', 'story', 'story', 'classic', 'vein', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'Stand', 'Me', 'etc', 'Dangerous', 'Lives', 'Altar', 'Boys', 'four', 'teenage', 'altar', 'Catholic', 'school', 'who', 'see', 'superheroes', 'battling', 'evil', 'Nunzilla', 'epic', 'battle', 'portrayed', 'film', 'brilliant', 'cartoon', 'animation.The', 'film', 'really', 'heartfelt', 'provide', 'sensitive', 'side', 'angst-ridden', 'time', 'period', 'kids', 'lives', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Kieran', 'Culkin', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'star', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'capture', 'characters', 'so', 'well', 'realistic', 'script', 'careful', 'direction', 'film', 'whole', 'so', 'realistic', 'even', 'animation', 'will', 'really', 'resonate', 'audience', 'members.The', 'DVD', 'tons', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'interviews', 'featurette', 'biographies', 'lot', 'more', 'Watching', 'interviews', 'really', 'fill', 'story', 'way', 'audience', 'good', 'idea', 'character', 'what', 'director', 'animator', 'were', 'going', 'well.This', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",N/A
