Houston"" who is filled with so much hate and insults Christianity like this truly does not know the meaning of Christmas.  Yes, this movie actually quotes the Bible.  It talks about the birth of Christ.  It bears a message of forgiveness and love.  Can you imagine the horror???The one star review also mentions how this movie is ""unbelievable"".  Well, to most liberals, statists and atheists, God's work is unbelievable.  That's the why they fall into one of those categories (or at least a portion of it).  This is all very sad that they would watch a movie such as this with such hatred and disdain.If you are still with this review, and you don't have the black heart that Patricia has, I highly encourage you to buy this movie.  If you are just a bit uncertain, see if you can rent it first.  It will warm your heart and definitely draw a tear towards the end.  I am a child of the 80's also.  It is great to see Mary Catherine Stewart again.  I always thought she was one of the 80's 'hotties' and enjoyed her work.  She still looks great and does a good job in this part.

Having interviewed Tracy Trost, the director, and Catherine Mary  Stewart, who has the female lead, we anticipated a real treat when we were permitted to preview the film.  Nor were we disappointed  as we found this to be one of the most outstanding Christmas  films that has come out in years.The plot is centered  around Kathleen (Catherine Mary Stewart), a hard business woman who has been greatly hurt by the past.  Right before Christmas her boyfriend Andrew (Anthony Tyler Quinn) asks her to look after his daughter Lucy (Cameron Ten Napal) while he is away on a business trip.  The fireworks between the daughter and possible future mother make a story in itself.  Then the enigmatic  Sam comes on the scene, as delightfully played by Muse Watson.  This mysterious figure appears to be a homeless man on a quest.  He is taken in by Kathleen, and  a major snowstorm and the failure of electricity force the three to live together through Christmas.While all of the acting is superb, there is special chemistry between Stewart and  Watkins that testifies to their depth as performers and their ability to get the most out of a scene.  For Stewart especially, this film makes the most of her ability, using  her in every scene and requiring that she go through the gamut of emotions.It must also be mentioned that in some  independent films, sadly family  ones, the quality of photography, sound and music can be a problem.  That is not the case with A Christmas Snow which we believe will measure up to any film from a major motion picture company.  Director and founder of Trost Moving Pictures, Tracy Trost  uses the utmost care in his work. This has already been tested in several major film festivals where the film has been previewed.  It has won top awards including best picture and best direction.In our opinion, if this were a theatrical release  it would be a candidate for Oscars in several categories.  Definitely best actress for Catherine Mary Stewart.",5,A Review From Point North Tidings,1285977600,"10 2, 2010",2010,2250,"['had', 'opportunity', 'review', 'excellent', 'film', 'magazine', 'Point', 'North', 'Tidings', 'have', 'been', 'urged', 'long', 'time', 'Amazon.Com', 'buyers', 'reprint', 'here.This', 'October', 'lovers', 'family-friendly', 'films', 'will', 'have', 'real', 'treat', 'release', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Snow', 'DVD', 'Having', 'interviewed', 'Tracy', 'Trost', 'director', 'Catherine', 'Mary', 'Stewart', 'who', 'female', 'lead', 'anticipated', 'real', 'treat', 'when', 'were', 'permitted', 'preview', 'film', 'were', 'disappointed', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'outstanding', 'Christmas', 'films', 'come', 'out', 'years.The', 'plot', 'centered', 'Kathleen', 'Catherine', 'Mary', 'Stewart', 'hard', 'business', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'greatly', 'hurt', 'past', 'Right', 'Christmas', 'boyfriend', 'Andrew', 'Anthony', 'Tyler', 'Quinn', 'look', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'Cameron', 'Ten', 'Napal', 'away', 'business', 'trip', 'fireworks', 'daughter', 'possible', 'future', 'mother', 'make', 'story', 'Then', 'enigmatic', 'Sam', 'scene', 'delightfully', 'played', 'Muse', 'Watson', 'mysterious', 'figure', 'be', 'homeless', 'man', 'quest', 'taken', 'Kathleen', 'major', 'snowstorm', 'failure', 'electricity', 'force', 'three', 'live', 'together', 'Christmas.While', 'acting', 'superb', 'special', 'chemistry', 'Stewart', 'Watkins', 'depth', 'performers', 'ability', 'get', 'most', 'scene', 'Stewart', 'especially', 'film', 'most', 'ability', 'using', 'scene', 'requiring', 'go', 'gamut', 'emotions.It', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'mentioned', 'independent', 'films', 'sadly', 'family', 'ones', 'quality', 'photography', 'sound', 'music', 'can', 'be', 'problem', 'not', 'case', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Snow', 'believe', 'will', 'measure', 'up', 'film', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'company', 'Director', 'founder', 'Trost', 'Moving', 'Pictures', 'Tracy', 'Trost', 'utmost', 'care', 'work', 'already', 'been', 'tested', 'several', 'major', 'film', 'festivals', 'where', 'film', 'been', 'previewed', 'won', 'top', 'awards', 'including', 'best', 'picture', 'best', 'direction.In', 'opinion', 'were', 'theatrical', 'release', 'would', 'be', 'candidate', 'Oscars', 'several', 'categories', 'Definitely', 'best', 'actress', 'Catherine', 'Mary', 'Stewart']",A Christmas Snow

But, yeah, for the film's opening minutes (and then for a few more minutes after) I was disenchanted with Kathleen and with Lucy. But, okay, let me set the table.It's not as if they broke the mold when they made Kathleen Mitchell (Catherine Mary Stewart). Her personal traits and tendencies are those exhibited by empty-living women so often featured in holiday movies. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, Kathleen Mitchell runs a gourmet restaurant, and maybe the local paper wasn't fibbing when it referred to her as a ""gourmet grinch."" Kathleen has commanded her staff to work thru the holidays. Her reason (and I don't know that I buy it): ""I will not abandon my loyal holiday loners."" I actually grinned when she said that. Sue me, it was a good line.Enter Kathleen's current beau Andrew Wright (Anthony Tyler Quinn) and his pouty 10-year-old daughter Lucy (Cameron Ten Napel). You don't need a PhD in Duh!ology to suss out that Lucy feels threatened by Kathleen's presence. She's still in that place where she feels no woman can replace her mom. So here's Lucy, prodding and testing Kathleen, being the champion brat.Mere days before Christmas, Tulsa is rocked by a freak winter storm, just in time to strand Kathleen and Lucy and a wise, grizzled samaritan named Sam on the corner of Royal Dublin Lane, where Kathleen lives. See, about Lucy, her dad had to be away for business and had asked Kathleen to mind Lucy. See, about Sam (Muse Watson), well, the story behind Sam's staying at Kathleen's may be too convoluted to tell. Suffice to say, he extricated her from parking lot peril and she felt indebted enough to drive him to the bus station only to find the bus station shut down for the night. Gauging the plummeting temperature, Kathleen invites Sam to stay over for the night. Huh, lookit that. Guess it's not so convoluted after all.2010's A Christmas Snow peels back its story and gradually steeps you in a series of captivating moments. There's stuff to pick up on, themes of faith and forgiveness and letting someone into your hurting heart. These three wonderful actors - Stewart, Ten Napel, and Watson - interact beautifully. I'm starting to get miffed, actually, 'cause I get this sense that they just pulled one over on me. I think there was a sermon or a lesson in there somewhere, but executed with such warmth and with such touching simplisticly that I lapped it up. And what Christmas movie is worth its salt that doesn't give you a good cry or a good gasp? And how awesome is Muse Watson?

I was very surprised by the ending and thought it a wonderful story.The story revolves around three characters: Kathleen (played by Catherine Mary Stewart) who is a dedicated career woman who shuns Christmas and any celebration of it as a result of her childhood abandonment by her father. She ends up having to &#34;babysit&#34; the daughter of her fianc&eacute;e (played by Cameron ten Napel) who has her own heartbreak to deal with - the death of her mother years ago that still haunts her. The third character is the stranger named Sam (played by Muse Watson) who defends Kathleen from muggers in a parking lot only to get hurt for his trouble and reach the bus station too late to catch his bus. Feeling beholden to Sam, Kathleen allows him to stay at her place for the night.Fate then plays a hand as a blizzard hits, making roads impassable as well as cutting the electric power! These three people are then forced to confront their pasts. Though the film deals with sadness and heartbreak, the characters find joy, humor and the freedom that comes with forgiveness. There is also redemption for one character.Catherine Stewart gives an acceptable performance, but the real stars here are Cameron ten Napel  and Muse Watson who steal the show!

Lucy's mother died a few years earlier, and Lucy is suspicious of any other woman who might try to take her place. She is also rather rude to Kathleen, and it doesn't help that Kathleen has no &#34;way with children&#34;. Kathleen leaves Lucy at home briefly to go out and run an errand. After almost running down an elderly pedestrian who later protected her during a parking lot scuffle with teenagers, ends up bringing him home for the night because the bus station is closed and he has no place to go. She invites Sam into her home with the intention of taking him back to the bus station in the morning.Overnight, an ice storm shuts down transportation and power and makes them housebound. Thus begins an alliance between Kathleen, Lucy and Sam. Since they are stuck in the house for a couple of days, they play games, cook pancakes, work on Lucy's costume for the school play, act out the Christmas pageant, tell stories and bond together as an unlikely family. Through these acts and their conversations, their individual stories are revealed - each of them scarred in someway and looking for a way out of their pain.It's a sweet story with a happy ending, one that young families can watch over and over.

Lucado ""I'm the other author named L...","[3, 3]","I don't typically watch ""Christian"" movies--the ones I've seen are sincere but tend to be poorly produced, filmed cheaply, badly acted, subtle as an avalanche, and maybe worst of all, sadly devoid of humor.  (""The Omega Code"", anyone?)However, I'm happy to say that ""A Christmas Snow"" changed my mind about this genre.  It's touching wthout being sappy, well-acted, (almost) credible, and enjoyable on its own terms.  And, maybe best of all, it actually has a sense of humor!First, some background.  I caught a broadcast of this movie late one night when I had an attack of insomnia.  I watched it mostly as an alternative to telenovelas and infomercials.  But what started out as an act of desperation next became a guilty pleasure and then outright admiration for putting together a nice little film.  I sought out re-broadcasts of the movie and persuaded my wife to watch along with me, and we both enjoyed it a couple more times.The plot isn't much; an ice storm just before Christmas traps a group of near-strangers in a house.  As they make the best of power outages, isolation, and holiday disappointments, they get to know each other a whole lot better.  One of them has a Big Secret (that you can probably guess after about a half hour), but the interplay of the characters is very engaging.I mentioned humor--there are a couple of laugh-out-loud moments, some of which happen so unexpectedly that you have to pay close attention.  Also, some of the interplay between the characters shows some real humanity and gentleness of spirit (unlike the heartless mean-spiritedness of so many mainstream shows and movies).The cast is strong, especially the youngest, Cameron ten Napel, whom I just saw in a new TV commercial, which reminded me of this movie and prompted this review.  She has some screen presence and plays the most authentically annoying brat I've seen on the screen in years.  Of course, her bark is worse than her bite--good thing, because I was ready to see her tossed into a snowbank after a few minutes--and she comes around.The other leads (Catherine Mary Stuart and Muse Watson) are pros, and acquit themselves well.  They share a couple of very moving scenes.Okay, this isn't a classic along the lines of Ralphie in ""A Christmas Story"", but it's a good flick, well worth your time.  I'd be happy to make it a part of my Holiday tradition.

With that out of the way, I have to say that I have not been touched by a film for a long time like I have been by A Christmas Snow.A Christmas Snow takes us into the life of Kathleen, a successful chef and restaurateur.  On the surface Kathleen's life looks golden.  Successful business, Attractive and successful boyfriend (Anthony Tyler Quinn), a nice home.  But as Christmas approaches and her employees ask for the day off, we learn there is more going on than meets the eye.  Kathleen's  father left she and her mom at Christmas.  An act that destroyed the very holiday for her and drove a wedge into her relationship with her mom.When her boyfriend is called out of town and has no one to care for his daughter Lucy (Cameron ten Napel), Kathleen reluctantly takes on the task.  Neither of them are thrilled with the situation.To add to the madness, Christmas is just a few days away, Kathleen is nearly mugged and is saved by a stranger, Sam (Muse Watson) and a record snow closes all the airports and roads and strands Sam from getting a bus to visit his daughter for the holidays.  The three complete strangers are forced to hold up at Kathleen's, waiting the storm out with out any amenities.It's within the confines of this comfortable home that we see the 3 main charters truly bloom.We learn that Sam is estranged from his own family and has decided this year to see if there is any way to fix what has been broken. Lucy reminds Kathleen what it really is like to be a child, especially at this magical time of year.  And Kathleen begins to see herself in terms of a whole person that realizes how much she has lost by shutting down her emotions and narrowing her own world.Muse Watson plays the quiet, gentle Sam with such power that you simply can not help but watch him during all his scenes.  Cameron plays Lucy with just the right amount of brattyiness and precociousness that fits her character in the beginning, starting with her restaurant scene and informing Cathleen that she is a ""ckick-a-tarian"", and building to a sensitive young woman who Kathleen can begin to identify with.  Catherine brings so much depth and maturity to her role that you can't help but feel for the struggles that she is going through.  Her scene with Muse in which the 2 lay open their lives and fears is one worth watching over and over again.While such words as ""small independent film"", ""family movie"" or ""faith based"" brings to mind poorly executed films, A Christmas Snow rises above all expectations and delivers a first rate, powerfully told, film that will be enjoyed for generations to come.",5,A Christmas Snow Delivers,1285891200,"10 1, 2010",2010,2702,"['First', 'off', 'will', 'state', 'am', 'friend', 'Catherine', 'Mary', 'Stewart', 'who', 'Kathleen', 'film', 'way', 'have', 'say', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'touched', 'film', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Snow.A', 'Christmas', 'Snow', 'life', 'Kathleen', 'successful', 'chef', 'restaurateur', 'surface', 'Kathleen', 'life', 'golden', 'Successful', 'business', 'Attractive', 'successful', 'boyfriend', 'Anthony', 'Tyler', 'Quinn', 'nice', 'home', 'Christmas', 'approaches', 'employees', 'ask', 'day', 'learn', 'more', 'going', 'meets', 'eye', 'Kathleen', 'father', 'left', 'mom', 'Christmas', 'act', 'destroyed', 'very', 'holiday', 'drove', 'wedge', 'relationship', 'mom.When', 'boyfriend', 'called', 'town', 'one', 'care', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'Cameron', 'ten', 'Napel', 'Kathleen', 'reluctantly', 'task', 'are', 'thrilled', 'situation.To', 'add', 'madness', 'Christmas', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'away', 'Kathleen', 'nearly', 'mugged', 'saved', 'stranger', 'Sam', 'Muse', 'Watson', 'record', 'snow', 'airports', 'roads', 'strands', 'Sam', 'getting', 'bus', 'visit', 'daughter', 'holidays', 'three', 'complete', 'strangers', 'are', 'forced', 'hold', 'up', 'Kathleen', 'waiting', 'storm', 'out', 'out', 'amenities.It', 'confines', 'comfortable', 'home', 'see', '3', 'main', 'charters', 'truly', 'bloom.We', 'learn', 'Sam', 'estranged', 'own', 'family', 'decided', 'year', 'see', 'way', 'fix', 'what', 'been', 'broken', 'Lucy', 'Kathleen', 'what', 'really', 'be', 'child', 'especially', 'magical', 'time', 'year', 'Kathleen', 'see', 'terms', 'whole', 'person', 'how', 'much', 'lost', 'shutting', 'down', 'emotions', 'narrowing', 'own', 'world.Muse', 'Watson', 'quiet', 'gentle', 'Sam', 'such', 'power', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'watch', 'scenes', 'Cameron', 'Lucy', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'brattyiness', 'precociousness', 'character', 'beginning', 'starting', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'informing', 'Cathleen', 'ckick-a-tarian', 'building', 'sensitive', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'Kathleen', 'can', 'begin', 'identify', 'Catherine', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'maturity', 'role', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'struggles', 'going', 'scene', 'Muse', '2', 'lay', 'open', 'lives', 'fears', 'one', 'worth', 'watching', 'again.While', 'such', 'words', 'small', 'independent', 'film', 'family', 'movie', 'faith', 'based', 'brings', 'mind', 'poorly', 'executed', 'films', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Snow', 'expectations', 'delivers', 'first', 'rate', 'powerfully', 'told', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'generations', 'come']",A Christmas Snow
