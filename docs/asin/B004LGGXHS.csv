Another art film school project gone horribly wrong!  Can't anybody delve into and design plots based on real mysteries out there; instead of concoting the most ridiculous and inane concepts!  Waste of time, money and celluloid!

1413124,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B004LGGXHS,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[1, 1]","A movie that takes place on the Mississippi about ghosts?  Count me in, right?  Wrong!  ""Beneath the Mississippi"" is one terrible movie.  I would be happy to summarize the plot for you, but that seems to be something that the creators of this flick felt were unnecessary along with dialogue, sound, character development, story and just about anything that makes a movie, well, a movie.  The only thing that I could ascertain from the movie was that some people went out on a boat on the Mississippi looking for ghosts or something, but for what purpose or why they expected to find anything, I am sure that I do not know.Basically, the movie is filled with scenes about two guys dragging a pontoon boat around in the shallows of the Mississippi, some guys scuba diving, one guy getting mad about someone stealing his beers, a few scenes of people paddling around in canoes, a few scenes with everyone wading in the shallows of the Mississippi River, a lot of incoherent dialogue and that's about it.  At least, that is all that I can tell from a movie that not only can you not see or understand what people are saying, but sometimes you cannot see anything at all. This movie is a total utter disaster in every sense of the word.

Maybe if the director spent time doing his job instead of jacking off he would have noticed. I have nothing personal against homeless hippies and crack whores, but damn... the cast of this film were awful. I recommend setting yourself on fire other than watching this movie.",1,Kill Me Please,1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,390,"['film', 'balls', 'hard', 'hear', 'actors', 'had', 'adjust', 'volume', 'continuously', 'film', 'Maybe', 'director', 'spent', 'time', 'doing', 'job', 'instead', 'jacking', 'off', 'would', 'have', 'noticed', 'have', 'nothing', 'personal', 'homeless', 'hippies', 'crack', 'whores', 'damn', 'cast', 'film', 'were', 'awful', 'recommend', 'setting', 'fire', 'other', 'watching', 'movie']",Beneath the Mississippi

You can barely hear the dialogue (which may be an unintended blessing).  But if you want to hear the sound of clanking dinnerware, the click of a recording button, or mosquitoes at deafening levels, this is yourt picture!The director also uses lengthy fades to no avail and shot the film in black and white, green and white, sepia and white, and color???  The lighting is so bad you can't see what's going on, and the plot (?) is so incoherent, the movie makes no sense.

Slow, boring, uninteresting, an awful stinker. Made no sense, had no point. Terrible lighting and sound.  Couldn't see or hear what was going on.  Background noise was LOUD.  Some documentary-maker woman goes back to a river basin where she was raised to find out what happened to her dad who vanished while they fished years ago.  Her, camera crew and river man, Jack are weird. Jack and Dave go in the water everyday looking around. The other woman just looks at photographs throughout the movie. The drunk blond guy goes insane after seeing ""something"" during a diving session. Strange little things happen. Despite this, none of the dummies leave.  The backstory is that in the 1920's, the son of the town's founder fathered an illegimate son with a prostitute. When the wealthy father found out about this discretion, he threatened to write his son out of the will. The son then sets his illegitimate son off in a boat and upon finding out, the boy's mother hangs herself. The movie could have built upon this premise and maybe been ok.  Instead it's a rumpled bumbled messy piece of cinema crap-o-la.
