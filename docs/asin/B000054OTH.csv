566843,AVJZQ6YNFUK92,B000054OTH,Grindhouse and Horror,"[2, 2]","This is actually a very well done low-budget horror flick with excellent scenery, suspense, nice soundtracks, some good atmosphere, and it's very well directed and acted. The story is about a couple on a Greek island which has an ancient sea monster nearby who requires human sacrifice. It's a slow moving film with a limited amount of gore. There's a couple of gore sequences that are shown underwater when the monster attacks and eats people, but there isn't any extreme gore. There's an emphasis placed on the films location, suspense and character development to engage the viewer instead of gore. As for the nudity, there's a very quick topless scene in the beginning. I thought the soundtrack in the beginning is really eerie, and they picked a great place to make the movie. You never get a full look at the creature. You just see its face and jaws and there's a part when it reaches up with its hand to grab one of its sacrificed victims. I would've liked to see the entire monster, but this slow film is a really good monster flick. The only problem is that some won't like it because it lacks action, is slow, and it does get talky at times.The DVD quality has washed out color and poor contrast.

566845,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B000054OTH,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[1, 1]","I have tremendous respect for James Earl Jones.  This man has a phenomenal talent and an incredible voice.  Jones was on a roll in the 70s and 80s, doing the voice of Darth Vader and then playing the role of Thulsa Doom in ""Conan the Barbarian.""  In between these incredible roles, Jones appeared in the 1982 film ""Blood Tide.""The movie itself has its moments.  Neil Grice (Martin Kove of ""Karate Kid"" fame) has traveled to an isolated Greek island to find his sister Madeline (Deborah Shelton, who would play Mandy Winger in the television show ""Dallas"" a couple of years down the road).  Once on the island, Neil and his wife Sherry (Mary Louise Weller, who some may remember as Mandy in ""Animal House"") encounter strange islander Nereus (Jos&eacute; Ferrer), visitor Frye (James Earl Jones) and Frye's girlfriend Barbara (Lydia Cornell, who was near the beginning of her now lengthy career).  Jones seems to be looking for treasure, while his girl friend likes to go skinny dipping in the ocean.While on a dive to a cave that is under water because of an ancient earthquake, Jones releases an ancient evil creature that then swims and runs about killing and eating targets of opportunity, which are nearly always women.  We see a painting of the monster and it has a large member, which may explain its preference for virgins.Much of the movie is spent trying to build a spooky atmosphere.  A lot of the focus is on Madeline, who seems to have been chosen through mystical means to be the creature's sacrifice, which should put the creature back to sleep.  While waiting for the happy day when Madeline and the creature should meet, Madeline bathes herself in expensive perfume and looks like she is spaced out.The acting talent is excellent, and I enjoyed every scene with Jones, Ferrer and Shelton.  If you like any of these three stars, this movie is worth a watch.Ferrer is suitably creepy as he continuously appears to know what is happening and perhaps the apparent inevitability of events even though he never reveals whether he knows anything.  He does try to prevent events from happening by getting the visitors to his small island to leave.  Of course, they do not.Jones presages the ending as he spouts lines from a Shakespeare tragedy.  Jones rises well above the material as he brings an interesting combination of subtle humor and self-absorbed arrogance to his role.  At the end of the movie, the actions he takes could appear to be self-sacrifice, but he seems to maintain his arrogance by appearing to recognize that he has the power to bring about resolution to the story.Shelton was the surprise.  She has relatively few lines, but her presence is really the center of the movie because she is the one chosen to fulfill the destiny of history as the monster's sacrifice.  Shelton brings an excellent combination of strange behavior and moodiness to her role as she struggles to understand why she behaves the way she does.However, this movie is a low budget film, and it shows.  The monster itself initially looks cool, but you quickly realize that the monster is little more than a mockup that has virtually no ability to move.  Because the monster has little capability, the director minimized camera shots of the monster to prevent you from seeing that the monster was little more than plastic on a frame.  The director almost could have eliminated the monster and the film would have been nearly as effective, perhaps even more effective.There is some nudity in this movie, though brief.  There is a lot of sexuality, some of it overt and a lot more that is subtle.  The violence is quite mild and the movie contains relatively little gore.  I was a bit surprised when sister Madeline kisses brother Neil near the end in quite a non-brotherly way.The picture is a bit grainy and the movie would definitely benefit from being remastered.I have watched many low budget films, and often they are worth only one watching, or I find myself reluctant to provide much of a recommendation.  However, this low-budget monster movie has an interesting moody atmosphere that I found intriguing.  It is unfortunate that when this movie was made, which was after the phenomenal special effects in ""Alien,"" that those special effects did not translate to this movie.  Yet, this movie is not too bad as long as you keep your expectations for the monster and for action low.  It is sufficiently fascinating that I have seen this movie several times for some of the interesting subtleties included by the director.Enjoy!",3,"All Star Cast, Low Budget Monster",1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,4529,"['have', 'tremendous', 'respect', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'man', 'phenomenal', 'talent', 'incredible', 'voice', 'Jones', 'was', 'roll', '70s', '80s', 'doing', 'voice', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'then', 'playing', 'role', 'Thulsa', 'Doom', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'incredible', 'roles', 'Jones', 'appeared', '1982', 'film', 'Blood', 'Tide', 'movie', 'moments', 'Neil', 'Grice', 'Martin', 'Kove', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'fame', 'traveled', 'isolated', 'Greek', 'island', 'find', 'sister', 'Madeline', 'Deborah', 'Shelton', 'who', 'would', 'play', 'Mandy', 'Winger', 'television', 'show', 'Dallas', 'couple', 'years', 'road', 'Once', 'island', 'Neil', 'wife', 'Sherry', 'Mary', 'Louise', 'Weller', 'who', 'may', 'remember', 'Mandy', 'Animal', 'House', 'encounter', 'strange', 'islander', 'Nereus', 'Jos', 'eacute', 'Ferrer', 'visitor', 'Frye', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Frye', 'girlfriend', 'Barbara', 'Lydia', 'Cornell', 'who', 'was', 'beginning', 'now', 'lengthy', 'career', 'Jones', 'be', 'looking', 'treasure', 'girl', 'friend', 'go', 'skinny', 'dipping', 'ocean.While', 'dive', 'cave', 'water', 'ancient', 'earthquake', 'Jones', 'ancient', 'evil', 'creature', 'then', 'killing', 'eating', 'targets', 'opportunity', 'are', 'nearly', 'always', 'women', 'see', 'painting', 'monster', 'large', 'member', 'may', 'explain', 'preference', 'virgins.Much', 'movie', 'spent', 'trying', 'build', 'spooky', 'atmosphere', 'lot', 'focus', 'Madeline', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'chosen', 'mystical', 'means', 'be', 'creature', 'sacrifice', 'should', 'put', 'creature', 'back', 'sleep', 'waiting', 'happy', 'day', 'when', 'Madeline', 'creature', 'should', 'meet', 'Madeline', 'expensive', 'perfume', 'spaced', 'acting', 'talent', 'excellent', 'enjoyed', 'scene', 'Jones', 'Ferrer', 'Shelton', 'like', 'three', 'stars', 'movie', 'watch.Ferrer', 'suitably', 'creepy', 'continuously', 'know', 'what', 'happening', 'perhaps', 'apparent', 'inevitability', 'events', 'even', 'never', 'anything', 'try', 'prevent', 'events', 'happening', 'getting', 'visitors', 'small', 'island', 'leave', 'course', 'do', 'not.Jones', 'presages', 'ending', 'lines', 'Shakespeare', 'tragedy', 'Jones', 'well', 'material', 'interesting', 'combination', 'subtle', 'humor', 'self-absorbed', 'arrogance', 'role', 'end', 'movie', 'actions', 'could', 'appear', 'be', 'self-sacrifice', 'maintain', 'arrogance', 'appearing', 'recognize', 'power', 'bring', 'about', 'resolution', 'story.Shelton', 'was', 'surprise', 'relatively', 'few', 'lines', 'presence', 'really', 'center', 'movie', 'one', 'chosen', 'fulfill', 'destiny', 'history', 'monster', 'sacrifice', 'Shelton', 'excellent', 'combination', 'strange', 'behavior', 'moodiness', 'role', 'understand', 'why', 'way', 'does.However', 'movie', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'monster', 'initially', 'cool', 'quickly', 'realize', 'monster', 'little', 'more', 'mockup', 'virtually', 'ability', 'move', 'monster', 'little', 'capability', 'director', 'minimized', 'camera', 'shots', 'monster', 'prevent', 'seeing', 'monster', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'plastic', 'frame', 'director', 'almost', 'could', 'have', 'eliminated', 'monster', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nearly', 'as', 'effective', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'nudity', 'movie', 'though', 'brief', 'lot', 'sexuality', 'overt', 'lot', 'more', 'subtle', 'violence', 'quite', 'mild', 'movie', 'relatively', 'little', 'gore', 'was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'when', 'sister', 'Madeline', 'brother', 'Neil', 'end', 'non-brotherly', 'way.The', 'picture', 'bit', 'grainy', 'movie', 'would', 'definitely', 'benefit', 'being', 'remastered.I', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'low', 'budget', 'films', 'often', 'are', 'worth', 'only', 'one', 'watching', 'find', 'reluctant', 'provide', 'much', 'recommendation', 'However', 'low-budget', 'monster', 'movie', 'interesting', 'moody', 'found', 'intriguing', 'unfortunate', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'special', 'effects', 'Alien', 'special', 'effects', 'did', 'not', 'translate', 'movie', 'movie', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'as', 'long', 'keep', 'expectations', 'monster', 'action', 'low', 'sufficiently', 'fascinating', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'interesting', 'subtleties', 'included', 'director.Enjoy']",N/A
566846,AWPE17FSUSNDC,B000054OTH,"Odo of Venafro ""Nicandemus""","[2, 2]","Yeah, really folks. I think someone on IMDB noted that people, for some reason, have been really hard on this movie. What do you want? It was acceptable for a post-seventies horror romp. It came out in an interesting year - 1982. The year I graduated from high-school. Although, I had never heard of this film until recently; I came across it on - ""Fifty SCi-Fi Classics"". It was shot on location; in very exotic local, I might add. Replete with ancient Christian monasteries. Moreover, it has two legendary actors: Jose Ferrer and James Earl Jones. And so what if Jones hams it up a bit, and also plays a little bit of a heavy.Some people noted the echoes from ""Jaws"". They are definitely there. I detected a nod (if a very remote one) to Italian/Argento style horror. This was in the massacre of the nuns. It does not show the nuns actually being killed. It shows the aftermath with corpses strewn all around. Perhaps this is what disturbed people. All the victims in the movie are women, and even minors. And the premise of the movie is ""virgin sacrifice"". And I think someone noted this too, that most of the victims, we can assume, are not virgins.Moreover, there is even a litle back story going on. I think the female (sort of lead) the exotic, runaway, beauty - Deborah Shelton (Madeline) and Frye (J E Jones) had a thing. Parenthetically, Shelton (although very pretty) has such a seventies, teen, pre-teen, afterschool special, movie of the week, PSA - presence,  it drips off the screen. She sings the closing credit anthem.Yet at the same time, this movie lacks the sex  which would become such a staple of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise, among others. Although there is alot of ""skin"" shown.Perhaps, it should be seen as a farewell to the seventies. As again, ""Friday the 13th"" and its ""ad nasueam"" sequels were being ushered in.So finally, I do not see why a group of young people cannot pop a bowl of popcorn, and have alot of fun watching this movie.

566847,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000054OTH,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","Blood Tide (Richard Jeffries, 1982)Screenwriter Richard Jeffries, recently responsible for the half-decent Bill Paxton flick The Vagrant and better-than-half-decent Dennis Quaid flick Cold Creek Manor, made the mistake of attempting to direct his first screenplay. He has not made the same mistake again, for which the world remains thankful.Blood Tide is a monster movie that doesn't contain a monster. Still, Jeffries managed to assemble a pretty high-powered cast for this film, headed by James Earl Jones and Jose Ferrer. More's the pity, as a lot of folks turn in decent performances in what would've made for a good piracy-on-the-high-seas tale, had it been filmed as such.Neil (Martin Kove, whose next role was in The Karate Kid) and his new wife Sherry (Mary Louise Weller, fresh off the underrated cult hit Q, in her final film role to date) have come to a remote Greek island looking for Neil's sister Madeline (beautiful veteran TV actress Deborah Shelton of Dallas and TJ Hooker fame). First, they're warned off by an old man who seems to be the unofficial leader of whatever passes for society on this remote island, Nereus (Ferrer). Ignoring him, they see Madeline and pursue her to the home of Frye (Jones), who's on the island for reasons unknown, and his lovely blonde sidekick Barbara (Lydia Cornell, who took an almost twenty-year vacation from the big screen after this role). Frye's presence on the island is quickly established; he's here to plunder ancient ruins hidden beneath the island. In doing so, however, he lets out an ancient evil...The main problem with this movie, as I said before, is that said ancient evil doesn't really make itself all that well seen. (It has less than a minute of actual screen time). Most of the Americans are pretty good in their roles, even if Cornell and Weller are trapped into playing bubbleheaded blondes, and Shelton shows a tendency for overacting. (In her defense, the inanity of the script, at times, would demand nothing less.) Ferrer doesn't really get enough screen time to do his character justice, but as always, he's fascinating, stealing any scene he's in, even in his confrontations with Jones.Jones' part is the most interesting, however; a seaborne raider who quotes Othello at odd, inopportune times and refers to Weller as ""white meat"" on one occasion. An interesting mix of Captain Quint and Dolemite, but his role isn't fleshed out enough to be truly memorable in the face of Jones' full oeuvre.It's got some good points, and it's got some bad points, but James Earl Jones fans and those who enjoy putting themselves through Z-grade monster movies should definitely keep an eye out for this one. **",2,"Abominably stupid, but still intriguing.",1112227200,"03 31, 2005",2005,2679,"['Blood', 'Tide', 'Richard', 'Jeffries', '1982', 'Screenwriter', 'Richard', 'Jeffries', 'recently', 'responsible', 'half-decent', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'Vagrant', 'better-than-half-decent', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'flick', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'made', 'mistake', 'attempting', 'direct', 'first', 'screenplay', 'not', 'made', 'same', 'mistake', 'again', 'world', 'thankful.Blood', 'Tide', 'monster', 'movie', ""n't"", 'contain', 'monster', 'Still', 'Jeffries', 'managed', 'assemble', 'pretty', 'high-powered', 'cast', 'film', 'headed', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Jose', 'Ferrer', 'More', 'pity', 'lot', 'folks', 'turn', 'decent', 'performances', 'what', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'good', 'piracy-on-the-high-seas', 'tale', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'such.Neil', 'Martin', 'Kove', 'next', 'role', 'was', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'new', 'wife', 'Sherry', 'Mary', 'Louise', 'Weller', 'fresh', 'off', 'underrated', 'cult', 'hit', 'Q', 'final', 'film', 'role', 'date', 'have', 'come', 'remote', 'Greek', 'island', 'looking', 'Neil', 'sister', 'Madeline', 'beautiful', 'veteran', 'TV', 'actress', 'Deborah', 'Shelton', 'Dallas', 'TJ', 'Hooker', 'fame', 'First', ""'re"", 'warned', 'off', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'unofficial', 'leader', 'passes', 'society', 'remote', 'island', 'Nereus', 'Ferrer', 'Ignoring', 'see', 'Madeline', 'pursue', 'home', 'Frye', 'Jones', 'who', 'island', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'lovely', 'blonde', 'sidekick', 'Barbara', 'Lydia', 'Cornell', 'who', 'took', 'almost', 'twenty-year', 'vacation', 'big', 'screen', 'role', 'Frye', 'presence', 'island', 'quickly', 'established', 'here', 'plunder', 'ancient', 'ruins', 'hidden', 'island', 'doing', 'so', 'however', 'out', 'ancient', 'evil', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'said', 'said', 'ancient', 'evil', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'well', 'seen', 'less', 'minute', 'actual', 'screen', 'time', 'Most', 'Americans', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'roles', 'even', 'Cornell', 'Weller', 'are', 'trapped', 'playing', 'bubbleheaded', 'blondes', 'Shelton', 'tendency', 'overacting', 'defense', 'inanity', 'script', 'times', 'would', 'demand', 'nothing', 'less', 'Ferrer', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'do', 'character', 'justice', 'always', 'fascinating', 'stealing', 'scene', 'even', 'confrontations', 'Jones.Jones', 'part', 'most', 'interesting', 'however', 'seaborne', 'raider', 'who', 'Othello', 'odd', 'inopportune', 'times', 'refers', 'Weller', 'white', 'meat', 'one', 'occasion', 'interesting', 'mix', 'Captain', 'Quint', 'Dolemite', 'role', ""n't"", 'fleshed', 'out', 'enough', 'be', 'truly', 'memorable', 'face', 'Jones', 'full', 'oeuvre.It', 'got', 'good', 'points', 'got', 'bad', 'points', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'fans', 'who', 'enjoy', 'putting', 'Z-grade', 'monster', 'movies', 'should', 'definitely', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'one', '**']",N/A
566848,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B000054OTH,Robert J. Crawford,"[1, 1]","This is a pretty fun film, not quite 4 stars but definitely 3.5.I liked it because for a monster flick, there are several layers to it.  Beyond a mysterious carnivorous creature, there is a pagan culture that has carried memories of a very distant time when there were remedies to keep it at bay - at a price of course.  It is embodied in Jose Ferrer, who does the ancient European thing very well and kind of controls the events that unfold.  Then you have the nearer past that is Christian, which adds its own odd beliefs (it is a nunnery that guards this tradition).  Finally, there is the confused secular present, with the couple (you get to see Belushi's window girlfriend from Animal House!) and Jones, who is a darn good scoundrel layabout smuggler.The center of it is a beautiful virgin artist, the sister of the ""hero"" looking to bring her back.  She appears crazy, though Ferrer wants her there and hidden for some reason.  Apparently, she is in touch with something.  Her action is to study ancient paintings at the nunnery, where her relationship with the mother superior guides her into refurbishing a painting - yes, she discovers a third layer, beneath the first two.This all leads to a fun climax, which I do not want to reveal.  The psychology is good, the historical sense is fun if you can see it, and then there is action.  Definitely an above average monster flick.Recommended as fun passtime.",3,"Good details, in plot with many subtleties",1197417600,"12 12, 2007",2007,1415,"['pretty', 'fun', 'film', 'not', 'quite', '4', 'stars', 'definitely', '3.5.I', 'liked', 'monster', 'flick', 'are', 'several', 'layers', 'Beyond', 'mysterious', 'carnivorous', 'creature', 'pagan', 'culture', 'carried', 'memories', 'very', 'distant', 'time', 'when', 'were', 'remedies', 'keep', 'bay', 'price', 'course', 'embodied', 'Jose', 'Ferrer', 'who', 'ancient', 'European', 'thing', 'very', 'well', 'kind', 'controls', 'events', 'unfold', 'Then', 'have', 'nearer', 'Christian', 'own', 'odd', 'beliefs', 'nunnery', 'tradition', 'Finally', 'confused', 'secular', 'present', 'couple', 'get', 'see', 'Belushi', 'window', 'girlfriend', 'Animal', 'House', 'Jones', 'who', 'darn', 'good', 'scoundrel', 'smuggler.The', 'center', 'beautiful', 'virgin', 'artist', 'sister', 'hero', 'looking', 'bring', 'back', 'crazy', 'Ferrer', 'hidden', 'reason', 'Apparently', 'touch', 'something', 'action', 'study', 'ancient', 'paintings', 'nunnery', 'where', 'relationship', 'mother', 'superior', 'refurbishing', 'painting', 'yes', 'third', 'layer', 'first', 'two.This', 'fun', 'climax', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'reveal', 'psychology', 'good', 'historical', 'sense', 'fun', 'can', 'see', 'then', 'action', 'Definitely', 'above', 'average', 'monster', 'flick.Recommended', 'fun', 'passtime']",N/A
566849,A26WVK274IA7DN,B000054OTH,Sarah Bellum,"[3, 3]","No, this film isn't great; yet, it doesn't suffer from delusions of grandeur, either. It rather neatly paces its story over its 82-minute runtime, providing few moments of excitement until its climax. Rather, it focuses on building the mystery of the secret surrounding the secret past of a tiny seaside village in Greece. American newlyweds Neil and Sherry Grice (Martin Kove and Mary-Louise Weller, respectively) have arrived in this Greek hamlet in hopes of locating Neil's missing sister, Madeline (played by Miss USA 1970 Deborah Shelton). Given the number of inhabitants here, it doesn't take long to find her, or to determine something has affected her deeply. According to American ex-pat Frye (James Earl Jones), she has ""gone native."" We don't find out until the end of the film what that means exactly, though we do have a good idea. Complementing the beauty of the Greek landscape (and really the reason I watched this film in the first place) is the mighty attractive Lydia Cornell. If you are of a certain age, you might recall Ms. Cornell from her role as Ted Knight's blonde daughter, Sara, on TV's ""Too Close for Comfort."" She is quite something in this film and she gets substantial screen time, though not enough to suit my tastes. Overall, I enjoyed the film. My biggest problem with the DVD, however, is the quality of the film. It appears to have been transferred from a VHS copy and, consequently, the colors are a bit faded, the image a bit soft and the sound pretty bad. Still, I have seen worse... much worse. I would like to see this film cleaned up and transferred from the original negatives; however, given the film's very minor status and fairly poor ratings, it is highly doubtful this will ever happen. 3/5 for the film, 1.5/5 for the DVD.",3,A tidy little film,1191974400,"10 10, 2007",2007,1772,"['film', ""n't"", 'great', 'yet', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'delusions', 'grandeur', 'either', 'rather', 'neatly', 'story', '82-minute', 'runtime', 'providing', 'few', 'moments', 'excitement', 'climax', 'Rather', 'building', 'mystery', 'secret', 'surrounding', 'secret', 'past', 'tiny', 'seaside', 'village', 'Greece', 'American', 'newlyweds', 'Neil', 'Sherry', 'Grice', 'Martin', 'Kove', 'Mary-Louise', 'Weller', 'respectively', 'have', 'arrived', 'Greek', 'hamlet', 'hopes', 'locating', 'Neil', 'missing', 'sister', 'Madeline', 'played', 'Miss', 'USA', '1970', 'Deborah', 'Shelton', 'Given', 'number', 'inhabitants', 'here', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'find', 'determine', 'something', 'affected', 'deeply', 'According', 'American', 'ex-pat', 'Frye', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'gone', 'native', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'end', 'film', 'what', 'exactly', 'do', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'Complementing', 'beauty', 'Greek', 'landscape', 'really', 'reason', 'watched', 'film', 'first', 'place', 'mighty', 'attractive', 'Lydia', 'Cornell', 'are', 'certain', 'age', 'might', 'recall', 'Ms.', 'Cornell', 'role', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'blonde', 'daughter', 'Sara', 'TV', 'Too', 'Close', 'Comfort', 'quite', 'something', 'film', 'substantial', 'screen', 'time', 'not', 'enough', 'suit', 'tastes', 'Overall', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'biggest', 'problem', 'DVD', 'however', 'quality', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'transferred', 'VHS', 'copy', 'consequently', 'colors', 'are', 'bit', 'faded', 'image', 'bit', 'soft', 'sound', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Still', 'have', 'seen', 'worse', 'much', 'worse', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'film', 'cleaned', 'up', 'transferred', 'original', 'negatives', 'however', 'given', 'film', 'very', 'minor', 'status', 'fairly', 'poor', 'ratings', 'highly', 'doubtful', 'will', 'ever', 'happen', '3/5', 'film', '1.5/5', 'DVD']",N/A
