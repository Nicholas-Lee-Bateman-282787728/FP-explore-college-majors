About 20 minutes in, FDR wins the election. There is great excitement in the Roosevelt home. So much so that FDR's adult son tosses flowers out of a vase, puts the vase on the floor, sits on the vase, grunts and grunts, and defecates into the vase (with appropriate special effects).If this is the kind of knee-slapping humor you like, buy it.If not, setting fire to a $20 bill is better use of your money than buying this.After I watched it, this DVD went into the trash, not the Half Price Books pile.",1,Atomic dud,1364169600,"03 25, 2013",2013,1061,"['When', 'stumbled', 'upon', 'Amazon', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'concept', 'posted', 'something', 'FB', 'page', 'Mistake.This', 'looked', 'high-camp', 'killer', 'B', 'knew', 'would', 'enjoy', 'FDR', 'fighting', 'Nazi', 'Werewolves', 'what', 'concept', 'good', 'part', 'actors', 'are', 'fair', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'even', 'killer', 'B', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad.However', 'say', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'group', 'junior', 'high', 'students', 'who', 'first', 'love', 'F', 'bomb', 'disservice', 'scripts', 'written', '14', 'year-olds', 'who', 'adore', 'potty', 'humor.Let', 'just', 'present', 'one', 'scene', '20', 'minutes', 'FDR', 'election', 'great', 'excitement', 'Roosevelt', 'home', 'So', 'much', 'FDR', 'adult', 'son', 'flowers', 'vase', 'vase', 'floor', 'vase', 'grunts', 'grunts', 'vase', 'appropriate', 'special', 'effects', '.If', 'kind', 'knee-slapping', 'humor', 'buy', 'not', 'setting', 'fire', '20', 'bill', 'better', 'use', 'money', 'buying', 'this.After', 'watched', 'DVD', 'went', 'trash', 'not', 'Half', 'Price', 'Books', 'pile']",N/A

Abe took his job seriously as did the film.  FDR AMERICAN BADASS pays no heed to historical accuracy.

I also have a sense of humor that can laugh at using an american icon like a President as a Vampire hunter or whatever else. When I read the bad reviews on this film, I figured it was just people who ""did not get the joke"". I rented it anyways. This is the absolute worst movie I have ever saw, and I saw Titanic 2. This was the worst script ever made and you could not even laugh at the amateur acting because the people involved here have made quality films in the past. FDR fighting Nazi werewolves sounds like it would be great right? Wrong. There are not werewolves. They are guys dressed up in what appears to be cocker spaniel outfits. Seriously. Do not waste time or money on this. My review is more entertaining than this movie is. The people here who said it was hilarious are either related to someone that made the film or think excessive use of the ""F"" word is hilarious in itself.
