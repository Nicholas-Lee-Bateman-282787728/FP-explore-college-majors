I came across this band as I scanned Amazon.com for more classic rock Blu-Ray disks.This group's ""Home"" disk can serve as the standard for music studios in terms of video and (especially) audio quality. In this regard it's superb.But their music (in this concert) sounds monotonous to my ear. I could not help but wonder how much better I would have liked it if they had mixed it up with three classic rock & roll tunes like Hey Jude, Let It Be and Mr. Tambourine Man (for example)- songs that will mesh well with their repetoire.Music that sounds monotonous often sounds like noise.",4,"Impressive, with a missing ingredient",1282953600,"08 28, 2010",2010,659,"[""'ll"", 'confess', 'very', 'recently', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Collective', 'Soul', 'came', 'band', 'scanned', 'Amazon.com', 'more', 'classic', 'rock', 'Blu-Ray', 'disks.This', 'group', 'Home', 'disk', 'can', 'serve', 'standard', 'music', 'studios', 'terms', 'video', 'especially', 'audio', 'quality', 'regard', 'superb.But', 'music', 'concert', 'monotonous', 'ear', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'had', 'mixed', 'up', 'three', 'classic', 'rock', 'roll', 'tunes', 'Hey', 'Jude', 'Let', 'Be', 'Mr.', 'Tambourine', 'Man', 'example', 'songs', 'will', 'mesh', 'well', 'repetoire.Music', 'monotonous', 'often', 'like', 'noise']",N/A

Having never seen the band before this blu-ray concert, I describe some of the songs as having a religious Christian influence, especially on the song, ""Shine,"" probably their most familiar song.  With that noted, Collective Soul definitely is a rock group, with the Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra adding a certain classical element to their rock songs.",5,Cool,1314748800,"08 31, 2011",2011,381,"['Collective', 'Soul', 'cool', 'Having', 'never', 'seen', 'band', 'blu-ray', 'concert', 'describe', 'songs', 'having', 'religious', 'Christian', 'influence', 'especially', 'song', 'Shine', 'probably', 'most', 'familiar', 'song', 'noted', 'Collective', 'Soul', 'definitely', 'rock', 'group', 'Atlanta', 'Symphony', 'Youth', 'Orchestra', 'adding', 'certain', 'classical', 'element', 'rock', 'songs']",N/A

Most have poor sound or the artists don't put on the type of show that I want to see. That is not the case with this one at all.Since I'm a fan of Collective Soul, I decided to watch this concert on TV. From the moment it starts with the director and the orchestra, I could tell it was going to be something a little different. And boy, was I right. What followed was one of the best looking and sounding concerts that I've ever sat through. I never would have believed that they could integrate the band with the orchestra in a way that I'd really enjoy. But they did. And they did it wonderfully.This was definitely an amazing production. I commend everyone who played a part in putting this together. They took some of my favorite music and fused it with an orchestra in a way that I never expected, and it just plain worked.So of course I had to order it on Blu-ray. This one is definitely worth it.",5,"Simply Fantastic, and I Don't Really Like Concerts",1296432000,"01 31, 2011",2011,1041,"['originally', 'caught', 'UHD', 'similar', 'channel', 'DirecTV', 'stated', 'title', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'watch', 'even', 'enjoy', 'concerts', 'Most', 'have', 'poor', 'sound', 'artists', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'type', 'show', 'want', 'see', 'not', 'case', 'one', 'all.Since', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Collective', 'Soul', 'decided', 'watch', 'concert', 'TV', 'moment', 'director', 'orchestra', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'boy', 'was', 'right', 'What', 'followed', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'looking', 'sounding', 'concerts', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'sat', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'believed', 'could', 'integrate', 'band', 'orchestra', 'way', ""'d"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'did', 'did', 'wonderfully.This', 'was', 'definitely', 'amazing', 'production', 'commend', 'everyone', 'who', 'played', 'part', 'putting', 'together', 'took', 'favorite', 'music', 'fused', 'orchestra', 'way', 'never', 'expected', 'just', 'plain', 'worked.So', 'course', 'had', 'order', 'Blu-ray', 'one', 'definitely', 'worth']",N/A
