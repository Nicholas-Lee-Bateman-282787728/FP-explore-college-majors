At first only their persistence to stay seems odd since much of your home is still not painted and sawdust is all over the floors. You wern't planning to open for at least another week. When they pull out stacks of bills saying name your price it is hard to resist. But then you also note one of the visitors is obviously not in tune with his surroundings. Truly a duck out of water. When he is almost killed and his passport reveals some unusual dates it becomes obvious the visitors aren't only time travellers but very morbid ones at that. For it is disasters they want to see. Afterall there is no disease, crime, or war where they come from. So people practically live forever and want for nothing except something exciting. Well written screenplay and good acting from Jeff Daniels make this a winner. Not to much in the way of SciFi as much as life philosophies are important to the storyline.

When I first saw it on home video I had read a really positive review and found it to be right on the money. Although the film suffers from a low budget (in fact director Twohy should revisit this with a nice large sizable budget)the characters are well drawn and Jeff Daniels gives a stellar performance. It's the end of the world for the citizens of a small town. When a group of odd travelers take up resident at his inn Ben Wilson (Jeff Daniels) gradually begins piecing together the real reason they are staying with him; a major disaster is about to happen. These spectators are tourists from the future who want to witness the event, human suffering and chaos that will result. Wilson determines that he, his daughter and the residents of the town must somehow survive this unknown tragedy. Wilson intends to change ""the past"" based on this knowledge something the visitors can't allow.Image quality is decent for this Anchor Bay release. The film was shot on a shoe string budget overcoming these obstacles with an imaginative screenplay based on C. L. Moore's classic short story ""Vintage Season"". The film takes some major departures from the original story but unlike some reviews here I felt that these departures allowed the audience to identify more readily with the main characters. Director Twohy (""Below"",""The Arrival"", ""Pitch Black"")does a great job of taking genre staples and turning the story on its head. ""Grand Tour-Diaster in Time"" is no exception to this. There aren't any extras to speak of beyond the trailer.While ""Grand Tour"" isn't a perfect film it's one of those rare films that manages to overcome its limitations due to the sheer imagination of the cast and crew. ""Grand Tour"" is definitely worth a visit for science fiction fans.",4,Enjoyable low budget and imaginative science fiction film 3 1/2 stars,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,1828,"['Grand', 'Tour-Disaster', 'Time', 'came', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'home', 'video', 'had', 'read', 'really', 'positive', 'review', 'found', 'be', 'right', 'money', 'film', 'suffers', 'low', 'budget', 'fact', 'director', 'Twohy', 'should', 'revisit', 'nice', 'large', 'sizable', 'budget', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'drawn', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'stellar', 'performance', 'end', 'world', 'citizens', 'small', 'town', 'When', 'group', 'odd', 'travelers', 'take', 'up', 'resident', 'inn', 'Ben', 'Wilson', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'gradually', 'piecing', 'together', 'real', 'reason', 'are', 'staying', 'major', 'disaster', 'happen', 'spectators', 'are', 'tourists', 'future', 'who', 'want', 'witness', 'event', 'human', 'suffering', 'chaos', 'will', 'result', 'Wilson', 'daughter', 'residents', 'town', 'must', 'somehow', 'survive', 'unknown', 'tragedy', 'Wilson', 'change', 'past', 'based', 'knowledge', 'something', 'visitors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'allow.Image', 'quality', 'decent', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'release', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'shoe', 'string', 'budget', 'overcoming', 'obstacles', 'imaginative', 'screenplay', 'based', 'C.', 'L.', 'Moore', 'classic', 'short', 'story', 'Vintage', 'Season', 'film', 'major', 'departures', 'original', 'story', 'reviews', 'here', 'felt', 'departures', 'allowed', 'audience', 'identify', 'more', 'readily', 'main', 'characters', 'Director', 'Twohy', 'Arrival', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'great', 'job', 'taking', 'genre', 'staples', 'turning', 'story', 'head', 'Grand', 'Tour-Diaster', 'Time', 'exception', 'are', ""n't"", 'extras', 'speak', 'trailer.While', 'Grand', 'Tour', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'film', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'overcome', 'limitations', 'due', 'sheer', 'imagination', 'cast', 'crew', 'Grand', 'Tour', 'definitely', 'worth', 'visit', 'science', 'fiction', 'fans']",Grand Tour - Disaster in Time VHS
319033,A1O60Q7LBN4MQ,6302530334,Wendy Schroeder,"[1, 3]","For a low budget movie, it wasn't bad...well except the ending. It was kind of like a long Twilight Zone episode. Time travelers from the ""perfect"" future go on adventures for excitement. Their time is given a description that sounds like Heaven by one traveler. But their paradise must be boring if they are wanting vicariously to experience tragedies. Ben Wilson (Jeff Daniels) wants to save his daughter from dying in it and so he sets into action to prevent her death and others as well.It's not a bad flick so if it ever happens to be on TV or can get a hold of a copy cheap, watch it. I really hated the ending just because it didn't make sense to me.One part that was interesting was when the time travelers left they were going to another disaster. New Orleans in 1999. Well, this was made in 1992 so of course the writers didn't know that a hurricane was going to hit it 6 years later.",3,Not bad for a low budget movie,1154563200,"08 3, 2006",2006,894,"['low', 'budget', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'well', 'ending', 'was', 'kind', 'long', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'Time', 'travelers', 'perfect', 'future', 'go', 'adventures', 'excitement', 'time', 'given', 'description', 'Heaven', 'one', 'traveler', 'paradise', 'must', 'be', 'boring', 'are', 'wanting', 'vicariously', 'experience', 'tragedies', 'Ben', 'Wilson', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'save', 'daughter', 'dying', 'so', 'action', 'prevent', 'death', 'others', 'well.It', 'not', 'bad', 'flick', 'so', 'ever', 'be', 'TV', 'can', 'get', 'hold', 'copy', 'cheap', 'watch', 'really', 'hated', 'ending', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'me.One', 'part', 'was', 'interesting', 'was', 'when', 'time', 'travelers', 'left', 'were', 'going', 'disaster', 'New', 'Orleans', '1999', 'Well', 'was', 'made', '1992', 'course', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'hurricane', 'was', 'going', 'hit', '6', 'years', 'later']",Grand Tour - Disaster in Time VHS
