However, Amazon has no fault in how Paramount has chosen to release DYNASTY in split seasons.  Amazon is simply the distributor/reseller.It is great that people have started taking a stand against such customer abuse.  Yet, we do still have those spoiled, elite few who think we are crazy for complaining.  They seem to forget that Paramount has released DYNASTY: SEASON 3 split in two, all in ONE year.  DYNASTY has NINE seasons. So, at this rate, can we all wait NINE YEARS until they release the final season?  And while you are at it, take out your calculators and do the math to see how much you will pay...Meanwhile, Warner Bros. has catered to its customers by releasing FULL seasons of DALLAS at a rate of three seasons a year and reasonable prices.

1172688,AZO8YKLTKAJGW,B001BN4WM2,"Laura J. Lendman ""DVDBUYER""","[3, 10]","First of all, I am a HUGE Dallas fan first and foremost, and was way too young to watch DYNASTY when it was on the air. I did happen to catch the two-part series finale and was immediately attracted to the show. I have held off on buying Season Two and Season Three. From what I have heard there are not enough people purchasing this series for them to release it as a full season. Hence the release of KNOT'S LANDING season one, which Warner Bros. were so put off buy the lack in sales that they refused to bring out season two, and that was like what, three years ago and still no season two. This is my advice, you can still order  DYNASTY season three part one from Borders Bookstores. I already have mine on order, but instead, I will purchase this package.If people keep complaining and boycotting this show, Paramount will more than likely not release anymore. And for those of you with the episodes on vhs, well good for you, I don't have them at all, and I want this full show on dvd, and the series finale, so don't ruin it for everyone else.Is DYNASTY a great show, yes it is, but the tides of time have come and gone and most of the original fans have moved on to other shows or are probably dead. Come on now, I don't mean to be rude by that comment, but alot of fans were the older generation who remember the three main stars in their prime from the 50's and 60's. Look what happened to BIG VALLEY, people boycotted the first part of season two and the studios wouldn't put it out anymore because they are not making enough profit to manufacture the dvds and put them out. Is it overly expensive, yes and no, because they have to hire a designer for the box, re-vamp the episodes so they don't look like crap, and loop the sound and that costs time and money. People don't do work for free, especially in the world of coporate profits and in the Hollywood Land.So if you love DYNASTY, just struggle through ok. Complaining and boycotting is just going to lead to no more releases. And for those of you wanting to purchase this, this is the best buy thus far for the three seasons. And please purchase KNOT'S LANDING season two which should be released some time next year. Warner Bro's are giving it one last chance and if the consumer does not make a dent in buying then we are all basically screwed for further releases. I would also like to see FALCON CREST and THE COLBYS have it's one dvd release. So get those credit cards ready and get to buying up some DYNASTY--remember it's high class entertainment and I don't think the Carringtons would bother squabbling about prices if it's something they want, they fork it over and enjoy the proceeds.",5,"OK, SO IT'S NOT PERFECT, BUT I AM PLEASED.",1222819200,"10 1, 2008",2008,2665,"['First', 'am', 'HUGE', 'Dallas', 'fan', 'first', 'foremost', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'young', 'watch', 'DYNASTY', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'did', 'happen', 'catch', 'two-part', 'series', 'finale', 'was', 'immediately', 'attracted', 'show', 'have', 'held', 'off', 'buying', 'Season', 'Two', 'Season', 'Three', 'what', 'have', 'heard', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'people', 'purchasing', 'series', 'release', 'full', 'season', 'Hence', 'release', 'KNOT', 'LANDING', 'season', 'one', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'were', 'so', 'put', 'off', 'buy', 'lack', 'sales', 'refused', 'bring', 'out', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'what', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'season', 'two', 'advice', 'can', 'still', 'order', 'DYNASTY', 'season', 'three', 'part', 'one', 'Borders', 'Bookstores', 'already', 'have', 'mine', 'order', 'instead', 'will', 'purchase', 'package.If', 'people', 'keep', 'complaining', 'boycotting', 'show', 'Paramount', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'not', 'release', 'anymore', 'episodes', 'vhs', 'well', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'want', 'full', 'show', 'dvd', 'series', 'finale', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'everyone', 'else.Is', 'DYNASTY', 'great', 'show', 'yes', 'tides', 'time', 'have', 'come', 'gone', 'most', 'original', 'fans', 'have', 'moved', 'other', 'shows', 'are', 'probably', 'dead', 'Come', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'be', 'rude', 'comment', 'alot', 'fans', 'were', 'older', 'generation', 'who', 'remember', 'three', 'main', 'stars', 'prime', '50', '60', 'Look', 'what', 'happened', 'BIG', 'VALLEY', 'people', 'boycotted', 'first', 'part', 'season', 'two', 'studios', 'would', ""n't"", 'put', 'out', 'anymore', 'are', 'not', 'making', 'enough', 'profit', 'manufacture', 'dvds', 'put', 'out', 'overly', 'expensive', 'yes', 'have', 'hire', 'designer', 'box', 're-vamp', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'crap', 'sound', 'costs', 'time', 'money', 'People', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'work', 'free', 'especially', 'world', 'coporate', 'profits', 'Hollywood', 'Land.So', 'love', 'DYNASTY', 'just', 'struggle', 'ok', 'Complaining', 'boycotting', 'just', 'going', 'lead', 'more', 'releases', 'wanting', 'purchase', 'best', 'buy', 'thus', 'far', 'three', 'seasons', 'please', 'purchase', 'KNOT', 'LANDING', 'season', 'two', 'should', 'be', 'released', 'time', 'next', 'year', 'Warner', 'Bro', 'are', 'giving', 'one', 'last', 'chance', 'consumer', 'not', 'make', 'dent', 'buying', 'then', 'are', 'basically', 'screwed', 'further', 'releases', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'see', 'FALCON', 'CREST', 'THE', 'COLBYS', 'have', 'one', 'dvd', 'release', 'get', 'credit', 'cards', 'ready', 'get', 'buying', 'up', 'DYNASTY', 'remember', 'high', 'class', 'entertainment', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Carringtons', 'would', 'bother', 'squabbling', 'prices', 'something', 'want', 'fork', 'enjoy', 'proceeds']",Dynasty - Seasons 1-3

I was happy when season two came out and was looking forward to buying complete seasons of 3, 4, and etc. because I knew Joan Collins saved the show like Donna Mills saved Knots Landing. However, I was shocked to see Dynasty Season 3 Volume 1 at the price of a complete season of Dallas. You can read what I thought about this in my comments on this particular item. There is no way I was going to buy it or Volume 2. Now, I see Volume 2 of Dynasty Season 3 is still out and Volume 1 of Dynasty Season 3 has been discontinued. Then, I see an annoucement Dynasty Season 4 Volume 1 will be coming out soon. So, the only way I can obtain the complete season 3 of Dynasty is to buy the complete Dynasty serices 1,2,3 in this pack. Hell, no. I think if anyone else buys the continuing series of this show in part volumes is stupid. I suggest Paramount apologizies to the Dynasty fans and revised 3 on up at S19.99 to make up for their greed. Please remember this is a recession and I for one will not waste my hard earned money.
