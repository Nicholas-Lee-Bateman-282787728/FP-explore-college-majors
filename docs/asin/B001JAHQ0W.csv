1205778,ARNAOSKQZMM2J,B001JAHQ0W,Amanda,"[6, 7]","Set in the Emergency Room at Chicago's County General Hospital, ER is a gritty, heart-pounding glimpse of how brisk decisions can save lives -and how one mistake can prove fatal. The show launched George Clooney's career and featured a stellar cast that included Julianna Margulies, Laura Innes, Anthony Edwards, Eriq La Salle, Noah Wyle, Sherry Stringfield, and others throughout the series' run. The combination of absorbing plot lines, compelling characters, top-notch performances, and realistic depictions of life in the ER attracted millions of fans each week. The eleventh season features more pulse-pounding medical incidents as well as significant lineup changes: long-time regular, Dr. Carter (Noah Wyle), decides to leave County General, and a new doctor, Ray Barnett (Shane West), enters it.Season eleven opens with Pratt (Mekhi Phifer), Chen (Ming-Na), and Elgin (James Earl) being rescued after barely escaping a crash into the Chicago river (well...except for Elgin); two new interns, most notably, Dr. Ray Barnett (West), entering County General; and the once-nurse Abby beginning her career as a doctor. Much like past seasons, each episode features a collection of primarily episodic plot lines that revolve around each of the show's main characters.Sadly, many of the episodes don't seem to have the kind of power and passion behind them that previous ones did, but, by far, ""Time of Death"" is the standout episode for the season. Unlike the traditional ER pattern, it consists of just one plot line with no side stories that takes place in real-time, chronicling the final 43 minutes of Charlie Metcalf's (Ray Liotta) life. Liotta plays an alcoholic on death's door who attempts to make amends with his son. His performance, which won a well-deserved Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series, makes this episode come alive, sticking with viewers long after it's finished.Other guest stars this season include Red Buttons, Danny Glover, Cynthia Nixon, Francis Fisher, Sharif Atkins, and others.The rest of the cast does a phenomenal job with the material they are given. However, the biggest loss of the season is the end of Wyle's tenure as Dr. Carter. He will certainly be missed in future seasons of ER (even though he does make the occasional guest appearance).The special features for season eleven follow the same trend as most of the previous seasons' boxed set - except this time there's no gag reel, only a collection of deleted scenes or ""Outpatient Outtakes."" Each tends to be really short and seems to add very little to the show overall, while this explains why the scenes were cut, it makes one wonder why they were even included at all other than to give hard-core fans the complete experience of the show. The episodes that feature deleted scenes are ""One of the Road,"" ""Damaged,"" ""Try Carter,"" ""Fear,"" ""White Guy, Dark Hair,"" ""A Shot in the Dark,"" ""Skin,"" ""Only Connect,"" ""The Providers,"" ""Middlemen,"" ""Alone in the Crowd,"" ""Here & There,"" ""Back in the World,"" ""Ruby Redux,"" and ""You are Here.""From a technical aspect, ER has always looks great on DVD. Utilizing widescreen from the beginning, this show was originally transferred to DVD with an ""open matte."" As HDTV became more prevalent, the series switched to a widescreen presentation in both standard definition airings and HD reairings. This DVD set uses the 1.78:1 widescreen presentation, which allows for a very impressive TV-to-DVD transfer.The audio for this release is a bit lacking at a 2.0 Dolby Digital English track. It is fine for the moments of dialogue during the show, but the loud, pulse-pounding, frantic emergency room scenes that the show is famous for don't quite pack enough audio punch. It just doesn't pull the viewer in as much as it should. Also included are English, French, Chinese and Portuguese subtitles.Die-hard fans of the show will snatch this one up, but others may have trouble. While season eleven still features the same heart-pounding medical drama that ER is known for, many of the episodes leave something to be desired and just don't have as engaging plot lines as previous seasons. Long-time fans of the show may overlook this, but for casual fans or viewers who may not be familiar with the ER world, this just isn't the season to get started with.",3,"Not the best season of ER, but still has some good moments",1248652800,"07 27, 2009",2009,4299,"['Set', 'Emergency', 'Room', 'Chicago', 'County', 'General', 'Hospital', 'ER', 'gritty', 'heart-pounding', 'glimpse', 'how', 'brisk', 'decisions', 'can', 'save', 'lives', '-and', 'how', 'one', 'mistake', 'can', 'prove', 'fatal', 'show', 'launched', 'George', 'Clooney', 'career', 'featured', 'stellar', 'cast', 'included', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'Laura', 'Innes', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'Eriq', 'La', 'Salle', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'Sherry', 'Stringfield', 'others', 'series', 'run', 'combination', 'absorbing', 'plot', 'lines', 'compelling', 'characters', 'top-notch', 'performances', 'realistic', 'depictions', 'life', 'ER', 'attracted', 'millions', 'fans', 'week', 'eleventh', 'season', 'more', 'pulse-pounding', 'medical', 'incidents', 'as', 'well', 'significant', 'lineup', 'changes', 'long-time', 'regular', 'Dr.', 'Carter', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'leave', 'County', 'General', 'new', 'doctor', 'Ray', 'Barnett', 'Shane', 'West', 'enters', 'it.Season', 'eleven', 'Pratt', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'Chen', 'Ming-Na', 'Elgin', 'James', 'Earl', 'being', 'rescued', 'barely', 'escaping', 'crash', 'Chicago', 'river', 'well', 'Elgin', 'two', 'new', 'interns', 'most', 'notably', 'Dr.', 'Ray', 'Barnett', 'West', 'entering', 'County', 'General', 'once-nurse', 'Abby', 'beginning', 'career', 'doctor', 'Much', 'past', 'seasons', 'episode', 'collection', 'primarily', 'episodic', 'plot', 'lines', 'revolve', 'show', 'main', 'characters.Sadly', 'many', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'kind', 'power', 'passion', 'previous', 'ones', 'did', 'far', 'Time', 'Death', 'standout', 'episode', 'season', 'traditional', 'ER', 'pattern', 'just', 'one', 'plot', 'line', 'side', 'place', 'real-time', 'chronicling', 'final', '43', 'minutes', 'Charlie', 'Metcalf', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'life', 'Liotta', 'alcoholic', 'death', 'door', 'who', 'make', 'amends', 'son', 'performance', 'won', 'well-deserved', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'Outstanding', 'Guest', 'Actor', 'Drama', 'Series', 'episode', 'come', 'alive', 'sticking', 'viewers', 'long', 'finished.Other', 'guest', 'season', 'include', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'Francis', 'Fisher', 'Sharif', 'Atkins', 'others.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'material', 'are', 'given', 'However', 'biggest', 'loss', 'season', 'end', 'Wyle', 'tenure', 'Dr.', 'Carter', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'missed', 'future', 'seasons', 'ER', 'even', 'make', 'occasional', 'guest', 'appearance', 'special', 'features', 'season', 'eleven', 'follow', 'same', 'trend', 'most', 'previous', 'seasons', 'boxed', 'set', 'time', 'gag', 'reel', 'only', 'collection', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Outpatient', 'Outtakes', 'be', 'really', 'short', 'add', 'very', 'little', 'show', 'overall', 'why', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'were', 'even', 'included', 'other', 'give', 'hard-core', 'fans', 'complete', 'experience', 'show', 'episodes', 'feature', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'One', 'Road', 'Damaged', 'Try', 'Carter', 'Fear', 'White', 'Guy', 'Dark', 'Hair', 'Shot', 'Dark', 'Skin', 'Only', 'Connect', 'Providers', 'Middlemen', 'Alone', 'Crowd', 'Here', 'Back', 'World', 'Ruby', 'Redux', 'are', 'Here', 'technical', 'aspect', 'ER', 'always', 'looks', 'great', 'DVD', 'Utilizing', 'widescreen', 'beginning', 'show', 'was', 'originally', 'transferred', 'DVD', 'open', 'matte', 'HDTV', 'became', 'more', 'prevalent', 'series', 'switched', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'standard', 'definition', 'airings', 'HD', 'reairings', 'DVD', 'set', '1.78:1', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'very', 'impressive', 'TV-to-DVD', 'transfer.The', 'audio', 'release', 'bit', 'lacking', '2.0', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'English', 'track', 'fine', 'moments', 'dialogue', 'show', 'loud', 'pulse-pounding', 'frantic', 'emergency', 'room', 'scenes', 'show', 'famous', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pack', 'enough', 'audio', 'punch', 'just', ""n't"", 'pull', 'viewer', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'English', 'French', 'Chinese', 'Portuguese', 'subtitles.Die-hard', 'fans', 'show', 'will', 'snatch', 'one', 'up', 'others', 'may', 'have', 'trouble', 'season', 'eleven', 'still', 'same', 'heart-pounding', 'medical', 'drama', 'ER', 'known', 'many', 'episodes', 'leave', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'engaging', 'plot', 'lines', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Long-time', 'fans', 'show', 'may', 'overlook', 'casual', 'fans', 'viewers', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'familiar', 'ER', 'world', 'just', ""n't"", 'season', 'get', 'started']",ER: Season 11
1205779,A3J1L5HC0RMCDX,B001JAHQ0W,"Anonymous45 ""michael cifelli""","[0, 0]","For those who want a almost perfect review, read the review by author ""Amanda"".  I can not think of much to add after reading what she wrote. For this season you need to read her review. What i will say i while the writing has changed, you have to remember this is its 11th season, and went to its 15th season.  So after ten seasons you have to expect changes. As a die hard fan, this season was very hard to watch. I think the writing was good. I was more than happy with the writing.  And for the record, i think some of its best seasons came after George Clooney left. Although i will give him the credit he is due with the episode where he saves a young boy from drowning. It was not long after that he left the show. People thought the show would tank. It got better. Season 8 is a standout for me, with Dr. Green leaving County General, and the show. The idea of ending a character through death really bothers me. But in this case, although it was brutal, season 8 is one of its best. The major theme was Dr. Green and his brain tumor.  Along with some side line themes.Season 11 for me was good, but very depressing. It was the end of what i think is the single most loved and best character of the show. Dr. Carter.  Noah Wyle leaves the show for good with some guest appearances.  Nobody would have guest that he would become one of the most loved characters of the show and for me, the most loved. His relationship with Dr. Benton over the early years, as mentor and student, really gave you a closeness to these characters. So in this season 11, to watch him go was very hard. Almost in a way where ER for me was never the same. Still a great show, the numbers did great, new fans had new characters to watch and grow up with.  But for day one fans, a very hard season to watch. I also do not like the send off they gave the character DR. Carter.  His send off party filled with nobody we knew, including a janitor.  Why would he be there. Even Carter asked who he was?  Dr. Kovac was there to give the toast, but in ER fashion a massive tragedy hits and they all leave to go back to the ER except Carter where he watches old clips on a projecter with the guy he did not know. And in the end, he says good bye to three people. Neela, Abby, and the New Dr. who's name is escaping me. Sorry?  It was a tear jerker as he reads a letter he had written to himself when he first started. Another tribute to Dr. Greene as it was Greene who was Carter's mentor after leaving surgery. The letter was sad, he gives it to abby, and in a way he is saying goodbye to her. I thought his character deserved a much better send off.  Dr. Greene had a whole season for his send  off.  To this day nobody can watch that and not cry. Carter deserved much better.Then the season i think where the writing was really  bad, was season 12?  Carter falls in love in Africa, and him and his wife end up splitting. I wont go into why. I feel they took Carter and just made his whole life a mess. All the way up until the end, there was nothing good for Carter except his foundation for the poor.  Which was great. But Carter was not happy with his life. The writers gave him nothing. A show about compassion,life, and love, and Carter had little of any of it. He ended up where he started in the 15th season in the last episode. At county general ER.  Season 11 also has Ray Liotta in an episode ""Time of Death"".  If you watch nothing else?  You must watch this episode in season 11.  Ray won an emmy for this character.  He plays a alcoholic, dying, and it's done in real time, and before he dies he tries reaching out to his son.  Not a soul who watched this was left with a dry face void of tears.  Overall, Carter leaves, you have a great cast, but still you miss the old cast. you cant help it after eleven years.  So i think the great new cast and the writing gets lost because you miss the originals so much. Season 12 I don't watch. They destroy Carter's life. So there was no joy in that for me. If your a ER fan, Or new to the show, I say you start with season 1 and go forward.You cant go wrong with one of the best drama's of all time. 15 years on the air?  and in the end still wanting more?  I think that speaks volumes. So season 11 is like most seasons. Worth watching, and new things to love about the show. Like i said in the beggining, if you want a perfect review, read ""Amanda"" review. I only disagree with her about the writing not being all that great. I think we just missed the old cast, and Carter leaving, it was just a bit hard for die hard fans. But her review was just about perfect and spot on.  My review is nowhere as good as i don't think anyones is as good as hers. Rent it, buy it, i own ever season on dvd.  And i still watch them to this day. I wish it was still on. enjoy....",5,A Different ER But Still Great,1364515200,"03 29, 2013",2013,4799,"['who', 'want', 'almost', 'perfect', 'review', 'read', 'review', 'author', 'Amanda', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'much', 'add', 'reading', 'what', 'wrote', 'season', 'need', 'read', 'review', 'What', 'i', 'will', 'say', 'i', 'writing', 'changed', 'have', 'remember', '11th', 'season', 'went', '15th', 'season', 'So', 'ten', 'seasons', 'have', 'expect', 'changes', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'season', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'watch', 'think', 'writing', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'more', 'happy', 'writing', 'record', 'i', 'think', 'best', 'seasons', 'came', 'George', 'Clooney', 'left', 'i', 'will', 'give', 'credit', 'due', 'episode', 'where', 'young', 'boy', 'drowning', 'was', 'not', 'long', 'left', 'show', 'People', 'thought', 'show', 'would', 'tank', 'got', 'better', 'Season', '8', 'standout', 'Dr.', 'Green', 'leaving', 'County', 'General', 'show', 'idea', 'ending', 'character', 'death', 'really', 'bothers', 'case', 'was', 'brutal', 'season', '8', 'one', 'best', 'major', 'theme', 'was', 'Dr.', 'Green', 'brain', 'tumor', 'side', 'line', 'themes.Season', '11', 'was', 'good', 'very', 'depressing', 'was', 'end', 'what', 'i', 'think', 'single', 'most', 'loved', 'best', 'character', 'show', 'Dr.', 'Carter', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'show', 'good', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Nobody', 'would', 'have', 'guest', 'would', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'loved', 'characters', 'show', 'most', 'loved', 'relationship', 'Dr.', 'Benton', 'early', 'years', 'mentor', 'student', 'really', 'gave', 'closeness', 'characters', 'So', 'season', '11', 'watch', 'go', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'Almost', 'way', 'where', 'ER', 'was', 'never', 'same', 'Still', 'great', 'show', 'numbers', 'did', 'great', 'new', 'fans', 'had', 'new', 'characters', 'watch', 'grow', 'up', 'day', 'one', 'fans', 'very', 'hard', 'season', 'watch', 'also', 'do', 'not', 'send', 'gave', 'character', 'DR.', 'Carter', 'send', 'party', 'filled', 'nobody', 'knew', 'including', 'janitor', 'Why', 'would', 'be', 'there', 'Even', 'Carter', 'asked', 'who', 'was', 'Dr.', 'Kovac', 'was', 'there', 'give', 'toast', 'ER', 'fashion', 'massive', 'tragedy', 'hits', 'leave', 'go', 'back', 'ER', 'Carter', 'where', 'old', 'clips', 'projecter', 'guy', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'end', 'good', 'bye', 'three', 'people', 'Neela', 'Abby', 'New', 'Dr.', 'who', 'name', 'escaping', 'Sorry', 'was', 'tear', 'jerker', 'letter', 'had', 'written', 'when', 'first', 'started', 'tribute', 'Dr.', 'Greene', 'was', 'Greene', 'who', 'was', 'Carter', 'mentor', 'leaving', 'surgery', 'letter', 'was', 'sad', 'abby', 'way', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'thought', 'character', 'deserved', 'much', 'better', 'send', 'off', 'Dr.', 'Greene', 'had', 'whole', 'season', 'send', 'off', 'day', 'nobody', 'can', 'watch', 'not', 'cry', 'Carter', 'deserved', 'much', 'season', 'i', 'think', 'where', 'writing', 'was', 'really', 'bad', 'was', 'season', '12', 'Carter', 'love', 'Africa', 'wife', 'end', 'up', 'splitting', 'wont', 'go', 'why', 'feel', 'took', 'Carter', 'just', 'made', 'whole', 'life', 'mess', 'way', 'end', 'was', 'nothing', 'good', 'Carter', 'foundation', 'poor', 'Which', 'was', 'great', 'Carter', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'life', 'writers', 'gave', 'nothing', 'show', 'compassion', 'life', 'love', 'Carter', 'had', 'little', 'ended', 'up', 'where', 'started', '15th', 'season', 'last', 'episode', 'county', 'general', 'ER', 'Season', '11', 'also', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'episode', 'Time', 'Death', 'watch', 'nothing', 'else', 'must', 'watch', 'episode', 'season', '11', 'Ray', 'won', 'emmy', 'character', 'alcoholic', 'dying', 'done', 'real', 'time', 'reaching', 'out', 'son', 'Not', 'soul', 'who', 'watched', 'was', 'left', 'dry', 'face', 'void', 'tears', 'Overall', 'Carter', 'have', 'great', 'cast', 'still', 'miss', 'old', 'cast', 'cant', 'help', 'eleven', 'years', 'So', 'i', 'think', 'great', 'new', 'cast', 'writing', 'lost', 'miss', 'originals', 'so', 'much', 'Season', '12', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'destroy', 'Carter', 'life', 'was', 'joy', 'ER', 'fan', 'new', 'show', 'say', 'start', 'season', '1', 'go', 'forward.You', 'cant', 'go', 'wrong', 'one', 'best', 'drama', 'time', '15', 'years', 'air', 'end', 'still', 'wanting', 'more', 'think', 'volumes', 'So', 'season', '11', 'most', 'seasons', 'Worth', 'watching', 'new', 'things', 'love', 'show', 'i', 'said', 'beggining', 'want', 'perfect', 'review', 'read', 'Amanda', 'review', 'only', 'disagree', 'writing', 'not', 'being', 'great', 'think', 'just', 'missed', 'old', 'cast', 'Carter', 'leaving', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'hard', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'review', 'was', 'just', 'perfect', 'spot', 'review', 'nowhere', 'as', 'good', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyones', 'as', 'good', 'hers', 'Rent', 'buy', 'own', 'ever', 'season', 'dvd', 'i', 'still', 'watch', 'day', 'wish', 'was', 'still', 'enjoy']",ER: Season 11

Marold""","[0, 0]","I now have the advantage of reviewing ER seasons after having watched all 15.and I'm happy to say that this episode sets the stage for what is good about the final third of the show. The best addition to the cast, although not as a regular, is Leland Orser, as Dr. Lucian Dubenko. He is similar in character to Wm. H. Macy's character in the first five episodes, but with greater day to day involvement. The difference between an average and an outstanding season can often rest with the major guest stars. This season has Red Buttons in two episodes, and I have never seen him better. Cynthia Nixon is in a one episode appearance. Like her guest appearance on Law and Order, SVU, it is stunning. The episode starring Ray Liotta is similar to a previous year's episode starring James Woods. But not quite as good as the Woods episode.Some of the regular cast members' story arches are a bit weak, such as when Dr. Archie Morris is selected as chief resident, simply because no one else wanted the job. It's odd that Scott Grimes, who plays Archie, is not listed as a lead actor yet. The best new face is Shane West. The addition of Sharif Atkins and the story ark with his character and Neela is engaging, but not as good as others.It seems as if Maura Tierney and Goran Visnjic are settling in to be the focus of the last third of ER",5,Establishing the framework for ER's final third of 15 seasons,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,1334,"['now', 'have', 'advantage', 'reviewing', 'ER', 'seasons', 'having', 'watched', '15.and', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'episode', 'stage', 'what', 'good', 'final', 'third', 'show', 'best', 'addition', 'cast', 'not', 'regular', 'Leland', 'Orser', 'Dr.', 'Lucian', 'Dubenko', 'similar', 'character', 'Wm', 'H.', 'Macy', 'character', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', 'greater', 'day', 'day', 'involvement', 'difference', 'average', 'outstanding', 'season', 'can', 'often', 'rest', 'major', 'guest', 'stars', 'season', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'two', 'episodes', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'better', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'one', 'episode', 'appearance', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'stunning', 'episode', 'starring', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'similar', 'previous', 'year', 'episode', 'starring', 'James', 'Woods', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Woods', 'episode.Some', 'regular', 'cast', 'members', 'story', 'arches', 'are', 'bit', 'weak', 'such', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Archie', 'Morris', 'selected', 'chief', 'resident', 'simply', 'one', 'else', 'wanted', 'job', 'odd', 'Scott', 'Grimes', 'who', 'Archie', 'not', 'listed', 'lead', 'actor', 'yet', 'best', 'new', 'face', 'Shane', 'West', 'addition', 'Sharif', 'Atkins', 'story', 'ark', 'character', 'Neela', 'engaging', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'others.It', 'Maura', 'Tierney', 'Goran', 'Visnjic', 'are', 'settling', 'be', 'focus', 'last', 'third', 'ER']",ER: Season 11

Seems like the regulars in the show get fewer and fewer, as the show progresses to the end which is sad. I really think ER was at its best when Doug..Mark..Benton..Carol..etc were there. I do not care much for the character Sam and seems like Kovak can never decide which woman he wants. It is disappointing to see Carter leave to go back to Africa and seems like Kem does not really care for him or love him, or she would have stayed with him. The baby dies, so she takes off not caring one bit about him.

Alex Kingston, Ming Na and Noah Wyle exit County General. Other guest stars include Red Buttons, Danny Glover, Cynthia Nixon, Francis Fisher and Sharif Atkins.Season 11 of ER includes some of the series' most memorable patient storylines. New doc Ray Barnett (Shane West) juggles medicine and music,Sam and Luka continue their turbulent relationship, and Corday is punished for performing an illegal operation. There is much to like about season 11, so why only four stars?While season 11 is very good, certain episodes leave something to be desired. Having Sharif Atkins return as Dr. Gallant was a good idea, butactually having an episode take place in Iraq made the show wander too far from County General. I liked the Gallant-Neela-Iraq storyline, butif I wanted to watched Baghdad ER, I would. Also, Carter unfortunately ends up with Kem. Some people like her, others don't. I think she's O.K., but nothing more. And the so-called cliffhanger with Sam's son at the end of the season didn't have me on the edge of my seat, and only led to a dull season 12 premiere.Now that I got all that outta the way, I can say that the rest of the stories, performances and medical cases are top notch ER.

1205792,ATJRTEOGW5OZN,B001JAHQ0W,Rons Reviews,"[10, 15]","ER: Season ElevenOn July fourteenth Warner Home Video released season eleven of this immensely popular series ER, and though season eleven marks the last for popular regulars Ming Na as Dr. Jing Mei ""Deb"" Chen, Alex Kingston as Dr. Elizabeth Corday, Sherry Stringfield as Dr. Susan Lewis, and Noah Wylie as Dr. John Carter, their respective exits were anticlimactic at best, if even acknowledged at all.  This season certainly represented a changing of the guard, unfortunately, with writing that took a step down from season ten, and one dimensional performances, said guard changing came a season too late.Season Eleven was one of conflict.  Some in the relationships within the show, but more so in the factions that existed within the cast and writers.  Attempts to write stories for the cast members that had been with the show longer yielded poor results, and simply not enough storylines were given to burgeoning stars such as Shane West as Dr. Ray Barnett and Scott Grimes as Dr. Archie Morris.  The performance of Grimes on ER would prove to be under appreciated throughout his tenure on the show, as he brought a comedic element to the show worthy of The Office, long before it was a hit.In season twelve, the writers would set things right as more storylines are dedicated to the people the fans want to see, and storylines such as the relationship between Luka (Goran Visnjic) and Sam (Linda Cardellini) are done away with in favor of those less annoying such as Luka and Abby (Maura Tierney).  Nonetheless, much awkwardness is endured throughout season eleven.Quality guest appearances are also few and far between in season eleven, and though Ray Liotta garnered an Emmy for his performance in Episode six ""Time of Death"", it was the writing and directing worthy of awards more than the limited performance of Liotta.  Legendary actor Red Buttons gives a superior performance as Jules ""Ruby"" Rubadoux the husband of a former patient of a young Dr. Carter, who is now in the ER as a patient and wants nothing to do with the Doctor that he believes killed his wife.  Cynthia Nixon gives a fine performance as a stroke victim in episode fifteen ""Alone in a Crowd"".  The writing in ""Alone in a Crowd"" is reminiscent and as innovative as an episode of MASH. We are also introduced to Charlie Pratt (Danny Glover), father of ER Doc Greg Pratt.  Like much of the cast, Glover would have more opportunities to truly display his acting chops in season twelve.Not much to be said of the performances of the regular cast member in season eleven, though Maura Tierney gives a credible performance when she is kidnapped in episode ten ""Skin"" which would have made a far superior season finale than that of ""The Show Must Go On"" in which we are left wondering what will become of Sam's runaway son Alex (Oliver Davis).Where as previous releases have included Gag reels as part of the bonus material, season eleven only provides outpatient outtakes and unaired scenes, the majority of which were justifiably left on the cutting room floor.Recommendation: Season eleven simply as not as good as season nine or twelve.  There is probably enough here for the true fan, but little for those not truly hooked.
