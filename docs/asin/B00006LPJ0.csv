721080,A22U5T9Q0GI5GV,B00006LPJ0,"Bill Bickley ""Brown Dirt Cowboy""","[0, 0]","This is a very touching film about dealing with loss and loneliness.  James Garner is visiting the rest home where his wife is being cared for because she is in the process of dying from Alzheimer's Disease. He is a bitter and lonely man.  He misses who his wife used to be and what they shared.  His children are grown and he is, for all intents and purposes, alone.  He meets Julie Andrews, who plays a widowed pediatrician, at the rest home.  As the two are leaving the home, the weather turns sour and Andrews' character offers Garner a ride.  Needless to say she finds him utterly detestable because he is a very grumpy old man.  They get into an accident and wind up spending Thanksgiving together in a cabin they've broken into for shelter.  Over the course of their stay in the cabin, the two become fast friends.  No cheating or anything of that sort, rather the two discover just how much they have in common and how much they like one another.  The romance begins after Garner's character's wife dies.  There is nothing untoward in the characters' relationship.  It is about two lonely people finding each other and becoming friends and eventually lovers.  Garner's character does not cheat on his wife.  I love the chemistry between Garner and Andrews in each of three of the films that I've seen them in.

721088,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,B00006LPJ0,Classic film buff,"[0, 0]","Julie Andrews and James Garner kept up their winning record as a team with this third pairing that premiered on network television Sunday November 28, 1999.  Both my wife and I had watched the original telecast and subsequent replays, and snapped it up when it came out on DVD.  This was one of the most highly rated movies for television for that year, and the star wattage and onscreen chemistry of Andrews and Garner are directly responsible.The story in some ways is improbable, but the viewer needs to accept it as such and appreciate the caliber of the Andrews/Garner partnership, they firmly and successfully carry the film on their shoulders.  It's Thanksgiving Day, and Doctor Catherine Howard (Julie Andrews) a lonely, widowed pediatric cardiologist visits the hospice where her late husband had spent his last days before dying of prostate cancer the prior year.  At the same time building contractor Robert Woodward (James Garner) is there with his grown daughters and grandson to bring his wife Mary Beth who is in the final stages of Alzheimer's disease home for Thanksgiving. However, Mary Beth doesn't recognize any of them and becomes hysterical when Robert tries to help her dress.  As the aide sooths Mary Beth and gets her back to bed, her daughters and grandson leave with the car on Robert's directive he wants to spend more time with his wife and will take a cab back.  However, the snowstorm that is occurring outside is rapidly becoming a blizzard, and Robert has difficulty getting a cab.  Catherine takes pity on him and asks him if he would like a lift, which he gratefully accepts.  However as they ride through almost whiteout conditions in her little sports car they both seem to irritate each other.  Suddenly, the car skids on the deserted road, Robert grabs the wheel and they wind up stuck in a snow bank but luckily unhurt.  However, they are lost in the middle of nowhere, in a raging blizzard, both cell phones are dead.  Thankfully they come upon shelter in an unoccupied farmhouse, and spend the night together waiting for day to break and the storm to subside.  Thrown together unwillingly by circumstance their initial antipathy warms into a nascent affection as both unbend and reveal more of their true selves.That's enough of the plot I hope to spark your interest in viewing the film, I don't want to give any more away. Sufficent to say it was quite refreshing when I first saw it in 1999 to see a tender, romantic love story between two mature individuals. Both characters are well written in presenting a positive portrayal of an older couple.  Ms. Andrews and Mr. Garner bring them to life with dignity, vulnerability, vitality and a sense of humor.  As all memorable screen couples do, they play off each other's strengths and weaknesses wonderfully and have powerful charisma.  They present a positive healthy image of two people from the AARP generation, and both look wonderful, particularly Ms. Andrews.Although the teleplay revolves around the Catherine and Robert relationship, there are a couple of subplots involving Robert's daughters, primarily the older, pregnant Lori (Patricia Charbonneau) who has a lot of not so repressed anger against her extranged husband Jeff (Stewart Bick), and her younger sister Jaclyn (Stacy Grant).  Both women have unresolved issues dealing with the stranger their mother has become due to the Alzheimer's.  Lori tends at first to be a rather abrasive martyr, and my sympathies went more to Jaclyn and Jeff.  However, she does undergo a change for the better before the film's conclusion.The filming of this was done I believe in the area of Montreal, Canada, and the snow scenes with the Christmas decorations are very picturesque.  The rustic farmhouse has a cosy, intimate quality, and Catherine's home is beautiful, set on a lake, rambling, decorated in elegant comfort, my wife and I wanted to move right in!Although this is a definitely a romantic drama, it does have some moments of humor that will bring a smile to your face and hopefully emit a chuckle or two, as in the title line of this review uttered by an exasperated Robert.  It also does deal with some serious issues such as Alzheimer's, lonliness, infidelity and sibling rivalry, granted in a limited way.  However, don't let those frighten you, watch for yourself, you will see the magic of Ms. Andrews and Mr. Garner make it indeed ""One Special Night"".",5,"""If we don't die I'm gonna kill her!""",1322438400,"11 28, 2011",2011,4414,"['Julie', 'Andrews', 'James', 'Garner', 'kept', 'up', 'winning', 'record', 'team', 'third', 'pairing', 'premiered', 'network', 'television', 'Sunday', 'November', '28', '1999', 'wife', 'had', 'watched', 'original', 'telecast', 'subsequent', 'replays', 'snapped', 'up', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'highly', 'rated', 'movies', 'television', 'year', 'star', 'wattage', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'Andrews', 'Garner', 'are', 'directly', 'responsible.The', 'story', 'ways', 'improbable', 'viewer', 'accept', 'such', 'appreciate', 'caliber', 'Andrews/Garner', 'partnership', 'firmly', 'successfully', 'carry', 'film', 'shoulders', 'Thanksgiving', 'Day', 'Doctor', 'Catherine', 'Howard', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'lonely', 'widowed', 'pediatric', 'cardiologist', 'hospice', 'where', 'late', 'husband', 'had', 'spent', 'last', 'days', 'dying', 'prostate', 'cancer', 'prior', 'year', 'same', 'time', 'building', 'contractor', 'Robert', 'Woodward', 'James', 'Garner', 'grown', 'daughters', 'grandson', 'bring', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'who', 'final', 'stages', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'home', 'Thanksgiving', 'However', 'Mary', 'Beth', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'becomes', 'hysterical', 'when', 'Robert', 'help', 'dress', 'aide', 'sooths', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'back', 'bed', 'daughters', 'grandson', 'leave', 'car', 'Robert', 'directive', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'wife', 'will', 'take', 'cab', 'back', 'However', 'snowstorm', 'occurring', 'outside', 'rapidly', 'becoming', 'blizzard', 'Robert', 'difficulty', 'getting', 'cab', 'Catherine', 'pity', 'would', 'like', 'lift', 'gratefully', 'However', 'ride', 'almost', 'conditions', 'little', 'sports', 'car', 'seem', 'irritate', 'other', 'Suddenly', 'car', 'skids', 'deserted', 'road', 'Robert', 'grabs', 'wheel', 'wind', 'up', 'stuck', 'snow', 'bank', 'luckily', 'unhurt', 'However', 'are', 'lost', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'raging', 'blizzard', 'cell', 'phones', 'are', 'dead', 'Thankfully', 'come', 'shelter', 'unoccupied', 'farmhouse', 'spend', 'night', 'together', 'waiting', 'day', 'break', 'storm', 'subside', 'Thrown', 'together', 'unwillingly', 'circumstance', 'initial', 'antipathy', 'warms', 'nascent', 'affection', 'unbend', 'reveal', 'more', 'true', 'selves.That', 'enough', 'plot', 'hope', 'spark', 'interest', 'viewing', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'more', 'away', 'Sufficent', 'say', 'was', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'when', 'first', 'saw', '1999', 'see', 'tender', 'romantic', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'mature', 'individuals', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'presenting', 'positive', 'portrayal', 'older', 'couple', 'Ms.', 'Andrews', 'Mr.', 'Garner', 'bring', 'life', 'dignity', 'vulnerability', 'vitality', 'sense', 'humor', 'memorable', 'screen', 'couples', 'do', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'wonderfully', 'have', 'powerful', 'charisma', 'present', 'positive', 'healthy', 'image', 'two', 'people', 'AARP', 'generation', 'look', 'wonderful', 'particularly', 'Ms.', 'Andrews.Although', 'teleplay', 'Catherine', 'Robert', 'relationship', 'are', 'couple', 'subplots', 'involving', 'Robert', 'daughters', 'primarily', 'older', 'pregnant', 'Lori', 'Patricia', 'Charbonneau', 'who', 'lot', 'not', 'so', 'repressed', 'anger', 'extranged', 'husband', 'Jeff', 'Stewart', 'Bick', 'younger', 'sister', 'Jaclyn', 'Stacy', 'Grant', 'women', 'have', 'unresolved', 'issues', 'dealing', 'stranger', 'mother', 'become', 'due', 'Alzheimer', 'Lori', 'first', 'be', 'rather', 'abrasive', 'martyr', 'sympathies', 'went', 'more', 'Jaclyn', 'Jeff', 'However', 'undergo', 'change', 'better', 'film', 'conclusion.The', 'filming', 'was', 'done', 'believe', 'area', 'Montreal', 'Canada', 'snow', 'scenes', 'Christmas', 'decorations', 'are', 'very', 'picturesque', 'rustic', 'farmhouse', 'cosy', 'intimate', 'quality', 'Catherine', 'home', 'beautiful', 'set', 'lake', 'rambling', 'decorated', 'elegant', 'comfort', 'wife', 'wanted', 'move', 'right', 'definitely', 'romantic', 'drama', 'have', 'moments', 'humor', 'will', 'bring', 'smile', 'face', 'hopefully', 'emit', 'chuckle', 'two', 'title', 'line', 'review', 'uttered', 'exasperated', 'Robert', 'also', 'deal', 'serious', 'issues', 'such', 'Alzheimer', 'lonliness', 'infidelity', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'granted', 'limited', 'way', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'frighten', 'watch', 'will', 'see', 'magic', 'Ms.', 'Andrews', 'Mr.', 'Garner', 'make', 'indeed', 'One', 'Special', 'Night']",One Special Night VHS

He is visiting her in a rest home when he is snowed in and a woman Katherine (Julie Andrews) a widower offers him a ride home in her vehicle.  Robert is very disagreeable and rude.Robert was an arrogant, grumpy man, a chauvinist who complains incessantly.  Katherine is an independent, intelligent, and successful woman doctor.  Where is the common ground?  Why do they go from hating each other to love?  The script did not address this.PLUSES - Both leading actors are believable in the roles they act.  We have enjoyed James Garner and Julie Andrews in many acting roles; unfortunately, this is not the case here.  Despite their excellent acting it was not enough to save this movie.MINUSES - Script, plot and character development.  They could have had something special here, but, they missed the mark completely.  They could have explored the difficulties of loosing a spouse to Alzheimer's or the difficulties of life as a widower.  There are a lot of emotions that could have been explored to give this movie purpose and depth, but, were not utilized.  James Garner's character in the movie NOTEBOOK is much better.The character of Robert was so rude and disagreeable and then him falling in love with Katherine with his wife suffering from Alzheimer's and in the rest home for only a short time (his daughters discuss that their mom has gotten ""bad"" for the past FOUR months) makes his character non endearing.CONCLUSION - We would pass on this movie.  If you are looking for a good HOLIDAY ROMANCE MOVIE than I would recommend looking at:A HOLIDAY FOR LOVE with Melissa Gilbert and Tim Matheson orTHE CHRISTMAS CARD with John Newton, Alice Evans and Edward Asner orA SEASON FOR MIRACLES(Hallmark) with Carla Gugino, David Conrad, Patty Duke, Lynn Redgrave, Laura Dern and Kathy Baker orCHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT with Barbara Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan.If you are looking for a good movie about RELATIONSHIPS set at the HOLIDAY TIME than consider:ONE TRUE THING(get the Kleenex) with Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger, William Hurt orABOUT A BOY with Hugh Grant, Rachel Weisz orTHE ULTIMATE GIFT with JAMES GARNER, Brian Dennehy, Abigail Breslin, Drew Fuller, & Bill Cobbs.",2,Excellent Acting Not Enough to Save this Movie,1230249600,"12 26, 2008",2008,2397,"['were', 'so', 'many', 'positive', 'ratings', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'case', 'PLOT', 'MOVIE', 'movie', 'man', 'named', 'Robert', 'James', 'Garner', 'who', 'married', 'woman', 'Alzheimer', 'visiting', 'rest', 'home', 'when', 'snowed', 'woman', 'Katherine', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'widower', 'ride', 'home', 'vehicle', 'Robert', 'very', 'disagreeable', 'rude.Robert', 'was', 'arrogant', 'grumpy', 'man', 'chauvinist', 'who', 'incessantly', 'Katherine', 'independent', 'intelligent', 'successful', 'woman', 'doctor', 'Where', 'common', 'ground', 'Why', 'do', 'go', 'hating', 'other', 'love', 'script', 'did', 'not', 'address', 'this.PLUSES', 'leading', 'actors', 'are', 'believable', 'roles', 'act', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'James', 'Garner', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'many', 'acting', 'roles', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'excellent', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'movie.MINUSES', 'Script', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'special', 'here', 'missed', 'mark', 'completely', 'could', 'have', 'explored', 'difficulties', 'loosing', 'spouse', 'Alzheimer', 'difficulties', 'life', 'widower', 'are', 'lot', 'emotions', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'give', 'movie', 'purpose', 'depth', 'were', 'not', 'utilized', 'James', 'Garner', 'character', 'movie', 'NOTEBOOK', 'much', 'better.The', 'character', 'Robert', 'was', 'so', 'rude', 'disagreeable', 'then', 'falling', 'love', 'Katherine', 'wife', 'suffering', 'Alzheimer', 'rest', 'home', 'only', 'short', 'time', 'daughters', 'discuss', 'mom', 'gotten', 'bad', 'past', 'FOUR', 'months', 'character', 'non', 'endearing.CONCLUSION', 'would', 'pass', 'movie', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'HOLIDAY', 'ROMANCE', 'MOVIE', 'would', 'recommend', 'looking', 'HOLIDAY', 'FOR', 'LOVE', 'Melissa', 'Gilbert', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'orTHE', 'CHRISTMAS', 'CARD', 'John', 'Newton', 'Alice', 'Evans', 'Edward', 'Asner', 'orA', 'SEASON', 'FOR', 'MIRACLES', 'Hallmark', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'David', 'Conrad', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'orCHRISTMAS', 'IN', 'CONNECTICUT', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'Dennis', 'Morgan.If', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'movie', 'RELATIONSHIPS', 'set', 'HOLIDAY', 'TIME', 'consider', 'ONE', 'TRUE', 'THING', 'get', 'Kleenex', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'William', 'Hurt', 'orABOUT', 'BOY', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'orTHE', 'ULTIMATE', 'GIFT', 'JAMES', 'GARNER', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Drew', 'Fuller', 'Bill', 'Cobbs']",One Special Night VHS

Boy, those snowstorm scenes are so lifelike I kept looking out the window to see if the snow was headed my way!  Julie Andrews and James Garner are great as two opposites in the twilight of life. Garner's wife is afllicted with Altzheimer's and it is touching to see the impact this terrible disease has, not only on the afflicted, but the families that are faced with torment as well. It is not probed in depth, which is good for the tone of the movie. The other topics, Julie Andrews' career as a pediatric cardiologist (Julie as a Doctor?) gives a bit of a women's lib touch to Garner's old fashioned male chauvinism (Garner: ""I noticed the MD license plates - is your husband a doctor?""

They make a great pair.James Garner found his serious side in this movie, I am used to him cracking jokes. If I thought he was a great actor before, after seeing this movie, he is great in all aspects of acting. I really believe he can do any kind of show he wants and come out on top. One of the top performers in my opinion. Julie Andrews was at her best in this one,she is a great actress but she really outdid herself in this one. This is a very heartwarming show, witch can make you cry, laugh and just plain feel good inside. I can understand how he felt with his kids being so concerned about him, with his wife in rest home suffering from Alzheimer's and the terrible sadness that goes along with seeing a loved one suffer so long. Julie Andrew as a pediatric cardiologists. A very touching movie. It has it all, sadness, a life that is full of health issues, laughs, and love.

Reteamed with veteran actor James Garner for the third time this pair of experienced movie pros work wonders with a touching and quite thought provoking story about loss in its many forms and how different people tend to handle it. Filmed in a chilly Montreal ""One Special Night"", takes us into the lives of two very different people who's lives have taken some unexpected turns for the worse and how during the lead up to the Christmas season these two individuals happen to find not only each other but also themselves at the same time. Romance between two older people hasn't been portrayed on screen as well in a long time and Julie Andrews and James Garner display that wonderful chemistry that they enjoyed together so well in their earlier teamings in ""The Amercianization of Emily"" and in ""Victor/Victoria"".As the story opens we find these two individuals, Robert (James Garner) and Catherine (Julie Andrews), living and working in the same part of Montreal without knowing each other. Just as the Christmas season is getting underway Robert becomes stranded at the hospital after visiting his wife who is suffering from dementia and alzheimers due to a sudden heavy blizzard. Hospital worker Catherine impulsively offers him a lift home in her car and to say the pair immediately have a clash of wills is an understatement as they disagree on everything to do with life and people however the pair face an even worse dilemma when Catherine's car slides off the road and the pair become lost. After an amusing trip on a tractor the pair seek refuge in an unoccupied cabin and are forced to stay the night there as the blizzard increases in ferocity and communications have been cut. However after the initial antagonism the pair; so very different in every way, over the course of the evening find a great source of comfort in each others company as they talk about their families and their own lives and especially their partners, in Robert's case a terminally sick wife and in Catherine's case her deceased but much missed husband. After spending the evening in the cabin the pair are finally rescued in the morning by Robert's son in law and they make a date to meet in a week's time at a coffee house they both know. However the best laid plans often go astray and the day they are due to meet Robert's wife dies and Catherine believes he decided against further contact. It takes the approaching delivery of Robert's grandchild to finally reunite the pair just as Christmas begins when at the hospital Catherine finally discovers the real reason why Robert didn't arrive at the coffee house. All ends happily when the actual birth of the child at which Catherine is present cements the future relationship that this couple never expected to have happen to them at this supposedly ""late"" period of their livesDespite the story of ""One Special Night"", being opened out with an examination of the family problems among the siblings of James Garner's character this film is very much a two character study from beginning to end. I often feel that because of her extraordinary musical talents and her huge string of successes in that area with classics like ""Mary Poppins"", and ""The Sound of Music"", Julie Andrews' dramatic abilities are often strangely overlooked. You only have to go back to the first collaboration between Julie and James Garner ""The Americanisation of Emily"", to see what she was capable of if given a strong dramatic role. Here in ""One Special Night"", she is again given a similiar opportunity to shine dramatically and as in her work in another earlier television movie she made with Ann Margaret titled ""Our Sons"", which dealt with the effects of A.I.D s on two families she proves what a superb dramatic actress she truly is. As the lonely Catherine still not dealing with her husband's passing she is both strong and vulnerable and is always very identifiable to anyone who has suffered a similar loss. Her chemistry with James Garner in ""One Special Night"", is vivid as always and it is a credit to these two gifted performers that their three films together have all been so different in content and the demands they have placed on them as performers with both coming up trumps each time. James Garner gives I believe one of his finest recent performances and is on a par with his superlative work in the tragic television movie ""Heartsounds"", which he made with Mary Tyler Moore many years back. The screenplay despite dealing with a Christmas themed story never shirks from displaying real human emotion and the romance between Catherine and Robert is never a smooth sailing affair but is one that experiences numerous misunderstandings and crossed signals that do threaten to end the connection these two older people have made with each other. ""One Special Night"", abounds with many beautiful moments that will touch your heart, some standouts being Julie/Catherine's venture into the coffee shop to hopefully meet up again with Robert to enjoyed the establishment's famed chocolate chip pancakes only to miss Robert who is called to the hospital by his wife's deteriorating condition, and especially when Catherine arrives at the hospice to spend time in her late husband's room as she often does only to be told the room is now taken by a new patient indicating that life outside her little world is moving on.  The look of this television film is also one of its very special qualities with the city of Montreal itself playing a big role in providing the type of chilling environment that is the vital crux for how these two people meet, spend time together, and gradually fall in love.Veteran performers Julie Andrews and James Garner are just at the right age now to make this romantic story both touching and very believable. Both their characters in the screenplay are not perfect and to a certain extent are comfortable in their ways and routines when their characters unexpectedly meet. ""One Special Night"", is really your perfect Christmas story but it does go far beyond simply celebrating the festive season in it's story. It instead gives a detailed examination of human resilience in times of tragedy and through periods of loneliness. Certainly it celebrates the belief that opposites can attract and its strong message that love can unexpectedly find you at any age is a welcome relief in our present youth oriented society. Julie Andrews is always a delight on screen and teaming with pal and former co star James Garner the two make a memorable screen team yet again in role svery different to their previous collaborations.  For the perfect Christmas story laced with romance and warm feeling you can't go past the touching ""One Special Night"".
