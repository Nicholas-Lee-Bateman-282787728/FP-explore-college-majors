353049,A3CSRP3P4U9HI,6303048218,Alan R. Holyoak,"[24, 25]","In &quot;The Point&quot; we meet and follow the experiences of a little lad named Oblio.  Oblio was born with a round head, but into a pointed world.  Everything in his village has points.  The buildings have points, the houses have points, and the main product of local industry is, well, points.  The people even have pointed heads.  What is a little round-headed fellow to do?Oblio endures the inevitable taunting of school mates, and other challenges that accompany someone who is, well, different.  Through it all though, Oblio remains pleasant, and polite.  After all of his trials, Oblio finally learns the answer to the question, &quot;Do you have to have a 'point' to have a point?&quot;This movie works at multiple levels.  It works as high quality entertainment for children of all ages.  It has animation remeniscent of &quot;School House Rock&quot; from the 1970s, memorable music, including the song, &quot;Me and My Arrow,&quot; and a great story line.  This movie also works for adults concerned about issues of diversity.  This movie would be as appropriate in a college classroom as in a family's front room.I highly recommend this movie to one and all.  You will enjoy it thoroughly...if you can find it.5-stars all the way!Alan Holyoak",5,Do you have to have a &quot;point&quot; to have a point?,981590400,"02 8, 2001",2001,1255,"['quot', 'Point', 'quot', 'meet', 'follow', 'experiences', 'little', 'lad', 'named', 'Oblio', 'Oblio', 'was', 'born', 'round', 'head', 'pointed', 'world', 'Everything', 'village', 'points', 'buildings', 'have', 'points', 'houses', 'have', 'points', 'main', 'product', 'local', 'industry', 'well', 'points', 'people', 'even', 'have', 'pointed', 'heads', 'What', 'little', 'round-headed', 'fellow', 'do', 'Oblio', 'inevitable', 'taunting', 'school', 'mates', 'other', 'challenges', 'accompany', 'someone', 'who', 'well', 'different', 'Oblio', 'pleasant', 'polite', 'trials', 'Oblio', 'finally', 'answer', 'question', 'quot', 'Do', 'have', 'have', ""'point"", 'have', 'point', 'quot', 'movie', 'multiple', 'levels', 'as', 'high', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'children', 'ages', 'animation', 'remeniscent', 'quot', 'School', 'House', 'Rock', 'quot', '1970s', 'memorable', 'music', 'including', 'song', 'quot', 'Me', 'My', 'Arrow', 'quot', 'great', 'story', 'line', 'movie', 'also', 'adults', 'concerned', 'issues', 'diversity', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'appropriate', 'college', 'classroom', 'family', 'front', 'room.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'one', 'will', 'enjoy', 'thoroughly', 'can', 'find', 'it.5-stars', 'way', 'Alan', 'Holyoak']",N/A

Nonetheless, it is a tale well told about the merits of raising a child according to his or her (in this case, his) nature. The main character, the boy, Oblio, is outcast, a victim of social conventions, prejudices and jealousies. His subsequent adventures lead him to discover things about himself and the world around him. The film touches upon the nuances of fitting into society without losing your identity, and it does so optimistically, without getting lost in bleak contradictions. The animation was innovative at the time of the film's release (corresponding aesthetically to then contemporary artwork) and it holds up well today. The dialogue is accessible by both young and old and the music is composed and performed by a master, Harry Nilsson.

353058,A3SOV9HFM5H9T1,6303048218,Bruce P. Barten,"[5, 5]","Harry Nilsson's 74-minute tale of politically subversive musical whimsy makes a fine counterargument which ought to be considered by anyone who might otherwise think that people in 1971 were confused.  There is absolutely nothing in this story that places it in the twentieth century:  its cartoon industrial satire includes the question of whether the world is ready for a tweed leaf or even herringbone in the fall line.  Oblio can't put down his roots in the Pointless Forest because he doesn't have any roots.History seems to be more like the big hole that Arrow almost falls into than any other part of the plot.  The great thing about the hole episode is the song that goes with it:  &quot;Hello, is there anybody else here?&quot;  Places in this cartoon are well defined by the songs that are used to identify them.  For the city:&quot;This is the town and these are the people, . . .That's the way they wanted it, that's the way they want it to stay.&quot;My favorite conversation, though it is hard to decide when there are so many comic bits to choose from, is:&quot;He's so young!&quot;&quot;Who?  The king?&quot;&quot;No, my Oblio.&quot;Mostly the theme is that the ability to point in all directions at the same time is pointless.  Common political competition is satirized by the game of triangle toss.  Since Oblio did not have a point, he had to come up with a novel way of catching the triangle, his mutt, as the Count's son called Arrow, Oblio's dog.  When measures are called for by the Count, little Oblio hardly rates any consideration when he asks, &quot;Would it help if I promised never to play triangle toss again?&quot;The kid is such a hero, the humor of the show is in making the topics of political philosophy seem like the preoccupation of a bunch of intellectually spoiled brats.  Certainly the Count's son is an inconsiderate little twit who wants rules that anything is legal for him, but &quot;The law is the law,&quot; as it applies to anyone else.  By making the people in this cartoon look so different, the story makes the transformation to mundane reality at the end seem like a relief, which adds nicely to the replay of the song that was at the beginning of this show.  &quot;Are you sleeping?

This allegorical classic had a simple but direct message--accept everyone for who they are and not force them to fit into a preconceived notion of who they should be. Oblio and Arrow his dog are banned from the town they live in. Why? Because the Evil Count decides that anyone that can beat his son at a game (misuse of power) and looks different (Oblio's the only child with a round head not a pointed head) shouldn't be allowed in the town. He's called pointless by the Count and others. But Oblio in Nilsson's extended allegory finds that nothing is pointless least of all himself.A charming film full of colorful imagery, ""The Point"" remains a classic to this day regardless of which one of the narrators you heard when you saw it. For the record, Dustin Hoffman was the original narrator. He was replaced by Ringo Starr and, then, finally Alan Thicke (of ""Growing Pains"" fame). The narrator on the original album was, of course, Nilsson himself. He would have done a delightful job of narrating this animated classic but elected to go with a professional ""actor"" in each case.There's not much in the way of extras. We can go directly to each song which is a nice touch although including Nilsson's original album (with his narration) would have been nice. Also, what about deleted scenes, a gallery of character designs and, perhaps, some footage of Nilsson himself? Ah well, perhaps next time.The picture quality is quite good although there's some minor analog imperfections such as dirt and debris but, on the whole, the film looks remarkably good. The soundtrack recorded in mono has more presence than the videotape version. I would have liked a surround mix of the original songs but that would have required remixing the original album mastertapes and that's probably not going to happen anytime soon. Also pick up Harry's album of the same name. The reissue of Harry's classic album supervised by Curtis Armstrong (yes, THE Curtis Armstrong of ""Moonlighting Fame"" and who gave a marvelous performance as the owner Ahmet Ertegunof Atlantic Records in ""Ray"")includes two early versions of songs that ended up on the album as well as a replica of the original booklet that came with the album.",5,Classic allegory about conformism,1107302400,"02 2, 2005",2005,2260,"['Harry', 'Nilsson', 'had', 'point', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'allegorical', 'classic', 'had', 'simple', 'direct', 'message', 'everyone', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'force', 'fit', 'preconceived', 'notion', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'Oblio', 'Arrow', 'dog', 'are', 'banned', 'town', 'live', 'Why', 'Evil', 'Count', 'anyone', 'can', 'beat', 'son', 'game', 'misuse', 'power', 'different', 'Oblio', 'only', 'child', 'round', 'head', 'not', 'pointed', 'head', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'allowed', 'town', 'called', 'pointless', 'Count', 'others', 'Oblio', 'Nilsson', 'extended', 'allegory', 'nothing', 'pointless', 'least', 'himself.A', 'charming', 'film', 'full', 'colorful', 'imagery', 'Point', 'classic', 'day', 'regardless', 'one', 'narrators', 'heard', 'when', 'saw', 'record', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'was', 'original', 'narrator', 'was', 'replaced', 'Ringo', 'Starr', 'then', 'finally', 'Alan', 'Thicke', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'fame', 'narrator', 'original', 'album', 'was', 'course', 'Nilsson', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'delightful', 'job', 'narrating', 'animated', 'classic', 'elected', 'go', 'professional', 'actor', 'case.There', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'extras', 'can', 'go', 'directly', 'song', 'nice', 'touch', 'including', 'Nilsson', 'original', 'album', 'narration', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Also', 'what', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gallery', 'character', 'designs', 'perhaps', 'footage', 'Nilsson', 'Ah', 'well', 'perhaps', 'next', 'time.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'quite', 'good', 'minor', 'analog', 'imperfections', 'such', 'dirt', 'debris', 'whole', 'film', 'remarkably', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'recorded', 'mono', 'more', 'presence', 'videotape', 'version', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'surround', 'mix', 'original', 'songs', 'would', 'have', 'required', 'remixing', 'original', 'album', 'mastertapes', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'happen', 'anytime', 'soon', 'Also', 'pick', 'up', 'Harry', 'album', 'same', 'name', 'reissue', 'Harry', 'classic', 'album', 'supervised', 'Curtis', 'Armstrong', 'yes', 'THE', 'Curtis', 'Armstrong', 'Moonlighting', 'Fame', 'who', 'gave', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'owner', 'Ahmet', 'Ertegunof', 'Atlantic', 'Records', 'Ray', 'two', 'early', 'versions', 'songs', 'ended', 'up', 'album', 'as', 'well', 'replica', 'original', 'booklet', 'came', 'album']",N/A
