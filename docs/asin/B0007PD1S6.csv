A bit dated(or is it WE who are the dated ones?!). I searched the internet and found a complete set that, when it arrived, came with Chinese postage and lettering. The quality was pretty good(an 7-8 out of 10, so it could be a Chinese copy of this very set!) and it was about $100. I know, foolish to use these fly-by-night(pun intended)boot-leggers... but if no commercial outfit is going to release them, what's a fella going to do???At 60 I still get a thrill from watching those Cessnas fly(there were two). If you can afford it, buy it. If not, search the web and take your chances. Now, how about  good copies of 77 Sunset Strip, Maverick, Hawaiian Eye and Adventures in Paradise? (Am I dating myself???)It is a pleasure to watch, I must admit. Sure miss Kirby Grant and Gloria Winters. Say, Kirby Grant Hoon was an interesting and talented fellow. Check him out on the net! Winters got married and retired after the series ended. Aah... those surely were the days.Lucky to have what we do....Scott O' the NorthPS Penny(Gloria Winters) was married to an acquaintance of mine. A CBS soundman whom I met on the LOU GRANT set(another good show not on DVD). He was a great guy named Dean Vernon. RIP both now.UPDATE as of Jan. 2013.I just purchased THIS set for full price. All the views and questions as stated remain. All I wish to add is that this IS the original of that Chinese ""knock-off"" set I paid $100  for about a year ago. Picture quality and sound do NOT look re-mastered, still about a 7-8 out of ten, but okay and very viewable. All the menu buttons seem to work here and that's important.It is my impression that Kirby Grant once owned the rights to these, but ""Sky King Inc."" seems to now have control. It's the only game in town.

886491,A23YISL5A66SF2,B0007PD1S6,Ed C.,"[1, 1]","I had been looking at this DVD set since it was first introduced years ago but just couldn't justify $250+ dollars for it.  I set up an eBay watch for it and, after a few years, one came up for sale ( the licensed sellers also sell these on eBay but this one was from a private seller).  The buy-it-now price was $75 but he also put in a best offer feature.  I probably should've just sprung for the $75 but offered him $50 and he took it!  The set was brand new so I have no idea where it came from, maybe an estate, but it is authentic.I started to watch them recently and began from episode 1.  As soon as the episode started I was horrified....it was AWFUL, almost unwatchable.  Very blurry and it has an annoying jumping like the projector was jamming, but it was continuous. It actually gave me a headache.  I stuck with it and watched the whole thing then watched episode #2...like night and day.  A perfect copy.  The third one wasn't bad but was grainy on a 55&#34; HD TV.  So it's hit and miss on quality but it's watchable, I'd give it a 7.5 out of 10 for quality.The book is very well done with a complete episode guide and many pictures, bios of all the characters both before and after Sky King,  trivia and even a trivia game.Like I said, it is what it is.  It's a classic show that you will own forever.  There are a lot of things that cost more and you'll get tired of within a year so I'll leave it up to you to decide if it's worth the cost.

886493,ACLJ1SG1M8OMW,B0007PD1S6,L. Antonicello,"[41, 42]","I've been a big fan of SKY KING since I was a child. I became aware of the Box Set about 2-3 years ago, but the price was prohibitive. I kept waiting for the price to come down or for another company to release it in stores (this seems to be a mail order only item). Last summer Ebay ran a 15% off promotion so I was able to get the box set for about $215.00 postpaid  - still way too expensive , but more on that later.Despite the advertising by the producer of the set about this being a REAL BOX SET its actually somewhat small - not much larger than a CD jewel box in size (5.5 inches by 4 inches, by 4.5 inches) . The box is sturdy though.  The discs are housed in soft flexible cases similar to CD cases, but made out of a softer  material that seem to protect the discs well. .  The good thing about this size is that no discs became dislodged during shipping. There are 18 discs and a small book.  There are no inserts or artwork in the individual cases. The book itself  is okay. It's small at 4 inches by 5 inches so the photos are small. (A larger box set could have accomodated a larger book). There's a basic  episode guide, and profiles of the stars, and the aforementioned photos , around 25 of them.  My set came with the book sitting under the cases, but I reversed it so the book sits on top. Now on to quality. The discs are DVD-R's, something I wasn't pleased about. They do have the Sky King logo and the episode names printed on them. The transfers are good , about 8-9 on a scale of 1 to 10. Sound is good basic mono - good enough that you can hear the dialog over the airplane engine and propeller noises. The episodes run in roughly the order they played on television in the 50's. The episodes appear to be complete at around 26 minutes and include the Nabisco bumpers but no commercials. All 72 episodes are included, so this is the complete series.  The set comes with a bonus disc which contains 2 Amos And Andy episodes.If you are reading this , you probably remember the show, but for the uninitiated, it's a cowboy show set in the ""new west"" of the 1950's. The big differance is that Sky King ( Kirby Grant) chases the outlaws with his Cessna T-50 airplane , accompanied by Penny ( Gloria Winters) and Clipper ( Ron Haggerty). The 30 minute  plots  are typical fun, enjoyable, Saturday Morning family type fare. The acting is fine as are the effects and sets.  The show originally ran from 1951 to 1959 in various network time spots and then for years in syndication, so it became a big favorite with many baby boomers .So the big question becomes is the set worth 200 plus dollars?  Probably not, especially for DVD-R's. But if you loved the Sky King  show like I did you may want to buy it. The company that released it doesn't seem to have any plans to sell it in the mass market at a lower price, so this may be the only way to get it.",4,I bought the  Sky King Box Set!

Might be the only thing they have of real marketable value, and they are looking to make some decent retirement money off of the popularity of the show.  I attempted to negotiate with the fella I believe was in charge of marketing.  Nice fella.  He wasn't inflexible or insensitive to my plight (too expensive for a poor guy like me).  He offered me a full set on VHS for quite a bit less, but that didn't interest me.  He even offered to sell me a DVD set on a two-installment payment plan -- acquiring one-half of the set at a time.  At least I believe that's what the terms were.  Much appreciated for sure, but it was still more than I could afford on a fixed income, retired, paying horrendous amounts on a monthly basis for mediorce health benefits.  Eats up over 60% of what we have for the entire month, which includes a hefty mortgage thanks to having to borrow against it to survive.  But you're not reading this to hear me whine, so I quickly digress.  I DID appreciate his efforts to work with me.  Of course, what I was really hoping for, if the truth be known, was for him to offer me a reduced price beings that I was a boomer who grew up with the show and loved it dearly!  No go, and that was perfectly his right.  I do NOT begrudge him that stance.  Who can blame him for wanting to make some decent money on what might amount to his only significant offering?  I can't.  Now when you stop and do the math, it averages out to only about $3.50 an episode.  It doesn't seem so over-priced when you look at it like that.  Had there been only 30 or 40 total episodes, we probably wouldn't be squawking as much.  Still, if you can't afford it, you can't afford it.  And that describes me and a whole lot of other people based upon what I have been reading here in these comments.

886497,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,B0007PD1S6,"Patrick W. Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[33, 36]","Next to Clint Eastwood, Sky King (played by Kirby Grant) was my favorite Western star. Chasing bad guys in an airplane was his ""schtick"" and it certainly appeals to me now, as much as it did in my youth.The early episodes were rendered in black-and-white, the later ones in color, to the best of my recollection. From Wikipedia:""The television version (there was originally a radio version) starred Kirby Grant as Sky King and Gloria Winters as his teen-aged niece Penny. Other regular characters included his nephew Clipper, played by Ron Hagerthy, and Mitch the sheriff, played by Ewing Mitchell. Unlike many ""lawman-acquaintance"" characters on other shows, Mitch was competent, intelligent and skilled. He was always coming to Sky for help, due to friendship and recognizing the utility of Sky's flying skills. Other recurring characters included Jim Bell, the ranch foreman, played by Chubby Johnson as well as Sheriff Hollister played by Monte Blue and Bob Carey played by Norman Ollestad.Many of the storylines would parallel those used in such dramatic potboilers as Adventures of Superman with the supporting cast repeatedly finding themselves in near death situations and the hero rescuing them with seconds to spare. Penny was particularly adroit at falling into the hands of spies, bank robbers (the best place to hide stolen loot was apparently in the Arizona desert) and other n'er-do-wells. After taunting the doomed Penny and mocking her uncle, they would invariably leave her tied up at the bottom of an abandoned mine with (take your pick) a ticking timebomb, rapidly rising water, collapsing ceilings, or crackling flames licking at her chair. Inexplicably, the bad guys would leave Penny in easy reach of a radio transmitter that would not only be turned on but switched to the frequency used by Uncle Sky who at that very moment would be circling above in the Songbird with an anxious Clipper at his side. Working the device with her shoulders and tongue, Penny would shout out ""Help, Uncle Sky, Help Help!"" Sky would shoot a quizzical look to Clipper and proclaim, ""That's Penny!! And it sounds like she's in trouble!"" Uncle Sky would make a steep bank and fly over the bad guys who would be instantly thrown into a state of complete confusion. All looking upward in complete anguish and fear, they would fire up at the Songbird in vain before losing control of their escape vehicle and plowing into a culvert where, through another set of incredible circumstances, Sheriff Mitch would be waiting for them after being alerted by Uncle Sky. The action would then cut back to the ranch where the happy throng is reunited without any explanation about how they found Penny and got down the mine without all of them getting killed. It was never explained why anyone would have an FAA spec radio transmitter at the bottom of an abandoned mine or how it would work 300 feet underground but such was the glory of imagination in the mid fifties!Like most TV cowboy heroes of the time, Sky never killed the bad guys, even though one episode had him shooting a machinegun into his own stolen plane.""""The show was filmed and shown during three periods as sponsors changed: 1951-52 (Derby Foods), 1955-56 and 1957-62 (Nabisco, though the copyright notices continued to name Derby Foods). It continued in syndication for years afterward, and was a staple on Saturday morning television into the mid-1960s.""""Though set in Arizona, the series was filmed in the high desert of California. The ranch house used for exterior shots of the Flying Crown Ranch is an actual home in Apple Valley, California. Other locations were shot in and around Apple Valley and the nearby San Bernardino Mountains, George Air Force Base and Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake. Interior filming was done at the General Service studio.""""The series Sky King ended production in February of 1959. There were no additional episodes filmed after that date. There has long been a rumor that a vault fire destroyed the only prints of 64 other episodes. This is incorrect, though. There were only 72 episodes produced in total.""Now, the price of this package has caused me to put off my buying these fine episodes. You CAN buy ""Voulme One"" (in black-and-white) for about five bucks if you'd like to see what the series was all about:Sky King:Vol 1 TV SeriesMy hope is that, someday soon, the entire series will be issued in similar releases but on that we'll just have to wait and see. In any case, this is a great old Saturday Morning Western for which I personally harbor a huge nostalgic reverence!",5,Pricey!!!,1212624000,"06 5, 2008",2008,4580,"['Next', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Sky',
