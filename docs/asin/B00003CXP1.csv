I've never used heavy drugs and I can't say this is the exact effects of them, but it's very convincing.  There's nothing sugar-coated here; it is very disturbing and dark.All the elements that made Pi a crossover success are here; hallucinatory camera effects, well-developed characters, and even Sean Gullette himself.  The movie's best moments aren't even the ones that center around the main character, Harry.  Instead, we are most enthralled by the side story of his mother, Sara, played by Ellen Burnstyn.  She has addictions that are just as strong as her son, the only difference is hers are politically correct and socially acceptable.  Instead of heroin and coke, she is controlled by sugar and diet pills.The movie doesn't have a happily-ever-after ending, as is such in the real world.  The movie never goes into prententious satirical-land, either.  It's just an unrelenting vision of the effects of drugs.

But in the sense that the film(along with it's stunningly pulsating soundtrack), never ever ever EVER EVER leaves your head and heart.This movie follows me daily, more so than my own shadow.Requiem is the most depressing film I've ever watched.My mother couldn't sleep for a whole night after seeing it.It is an absolute nightmare-graphic and shocking and visually uninhibited to the very extent.It's not so much the content of the film, as the entire atmosphere of it-you'll be so depressed by the end that you'll wonder whether there's a meaning to this life.I wouldn't recommend watching this movie at night-it's hard to get a good night's slep afterwards.I cannot stress this enough-it is nothing short of a living nightmare and will leave you on the verge of a suicide attemptThat said, this movie can be summed up in two words-horrific and heartbraking.It is so heartbraking, that your stomach hurts and your heart aches, and all you can think of is these characters' descent into their own private hell.But that's what drugs are.I believe it impossible to make a witty, or darkly comic movie about drugs.Drugs are a nightmare-they take over your soula and mind, and destroy every shred of humanity within you-addiction in general is just that, although that all depends what you're addicted to.That is like watching a film about rape and complaining that the rape scene was &quot;too difficult&quot;.Did it ever occur to you that maybe rape is a little difficult.By the end, Requiem no longer feels like a movie, but like a living nightmare with a very sad core.It is the most stunning,powerful, horrifying,heartbraking, unbelievably mind-numbingly,heart-achingly,stomach-chrningly unforgettable film I've ever seen,",5,A modern masterpiece of unquestionable truth and

Not only is it visually stunning--making use of clever editing and fliming techniques like split-screens and special effects--the story is one that will stay with you for a long time. Although the movie will leave you breathless and coming away with that feeling of ""damn, that was a good movie,"" it's not for the faint-of-heart.The movie is aptly named as the story follows a mother and her son, both on parallel tracks into drug addiction, and his best friend and girlfriend, and how their dreams disintegrate with the passing seasons. All four characters descend into the depths of hell, making choices they wouldn't otherwise make, just to score some dope.Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly, and the fantastic Ellen Burstyn give outstanding performances. Why this film didn't sweep the Academy Awards is beyond me.I wasn't going to buy it on Blu-Ray, because I already have the DVD version, but since it was on sale here on Amazon, I couldn't resist.I'm so glad I got the Blu-Ray edition.

530749,AF1VHA7BVWLO1,B00003CXP1,Alexia Komaux,"[0, 0]","Requiem for a Dream is an incredibly unique film. Not just because of it's subject matter (drug use is hardly infrequent in films these days), but because of the feeling it gives the viewer during and for a long time after the film has ended.The best word to describe Requiem is 'heartbreaking'. It is shocking, disturbing, moving and heartbreaking. I won't give too much away but the feeling you get once the film has ended is one of extreme emptiness. I didn't know how to feel after the first time I'd watched it. I cried like a baby, but I felt more than just sadness. The second time I watched it, I watched the first fifteen minutes of the film and then the last fifteen minutes. The contrast is incredible, and it was this that made me feel so empty.The acting is amazing. Marlon Wayans was excellent in a serious role, Jared Leto was perfect as Harry, who wants to do right by his loved ones and get rich at the same time. Jennifer Connelly portrays strong-willed Marion, who ultimately loses her dignity to get her fix. One of the most shocking things other than the film itself is the fact that Ellen Burstyn was overlooked for the Best Actress Oscar. How the Academy could have thought anyone gave a better performance that year (or any other year for that matter) is beyond me. Her portrayal of Harry's desperately lonely mother is the key to this film being so powerful.Requiem for a Dream is a tragic film that grabs your emotions from the very beginning, takes them on a roller-coaster, then squeezes the life out of them before battering them to a pulp. The most incredible, breathtaking and ultimately heartbreaking film I've ever seen, and one that will remain at the top of my favourite films list for a long time to come.

It's so hellish that it might just manage to scare some people away from drugs.  The four main characters start out seeming not so very different from people you might know.  But they gradually descend into a nightmarish downward spiral of drug addiction, and have their lives so thoroughly destroyed by drugs that it leaves you shuddering in mixed revulsion and sympathy by the end of the picture.(Spoilers) Ellen Burstyn's character ends up being literally driven insane by her addiction to speed-laced diet pills.  One of the last scenes of the movie is a heart wrenching scene of her friends from her neighborhood visiting her in the hospital, slack-jawed with shock and horror as they view the electro-shock treated, almost catatonic shell of the woman who had been their old and good friend.  Her son Harry, played by Jared Leto, nearly dies from his experience, and ends up losing an arm - he avoids going to the doctor so long for treatment of the infection that he's gotten from using dirty needles (out of fear of being arrested) that gangrene sets in and doctors have to amputate.  His friend, played by Marlon Wayans, ends up doing hard time when he's caught by the police.  But worst of all, perhaps, is the fate of Harry's girlfriend, played by the gorgeous Jennifer Connelly.  In her, most of all, you can see the terrible degeneration take place.  She starts out a normal girl who simply likes to have a good time.  Then at one point, when her addiction really starts to assert itself, she becomes desperate enough for drugs to sleep with a man she dislikes for money she can use to buy drugs.  She rushes from her liason with him, and barely makes it outside his apartment building before she throws up in disgust and revulsion at what she's done.  Yet by the end of the picture, so great has her desperation for her next fix become, that she is not only willing to give oral sex to a complete stranger for drugs, she performs live sex shows on stage in front of a howling mob of drooling perverts - and she is so far gone in moral degradation that her revulsion, along with her dignity, is a thing of the past.As I said, this film is grim and very adult oriented.  But so many young people are being hooked on drugs these days that it ought to be required viewing, for it is a harsh, unflinching look at what REALLY CAN HAPPEN TO YOU if you start using hard drugs, but it's one that isn't as alarmist and overdone as the infamous movie ""Reefer Madness.""

The power of this movie overwhelmed me.  Darren Aronofsky creates a 5 star-film with all-star performances, based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s compelling novel.  Masterfully put together, this movie is classed amongst my Top Ten list of Best Films of All-Time.  In fact, it is #1 presently.The film's depiction of drug-abuse is overwhelmingly accurate as far as what drugs do.  But never did they really say what drug it was the four characters (Harry, Marion, Sara, and Tyrone) were using.  Drugs seems to be the device used to both promote and steal each of the entity's `dream,' thus the dreams of the four were already doomed from the beginning.  It was as if the drugs themselves were teasing each one, giving them the instant gratification they were seeking, then took everything away once they reached the a point on the road where it was too late to go back.The musical score plays a significant role in the whole film's success.  Its bold and pervasive style composed by Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet help establish the film noir quality.  It truly plays a role that strengthens the viewer's emotions and attentiveness towards the film.First time viewers, prepare your minds for an explosive rendition of the effects of drug-abuse.  Starring classic legend Ellen Burstyn, the appealing Jarod Leto, the exquisite actress Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans, generally known for his humorous films.

530763,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXP1,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","If ever there was a movie that exposed drug addiction for the horror that it truly is, this is that film.  `Requiem for a Dream' is understandably a very hard film to watch.  Everything from its intense subject matter to its sporadic and chaotic direction is set to either draw you in or push you away.  I don't think there can be an in between for this film.  You either love it wholeheartedly or you loathe it and consider it a waste of time.  It's a film that will leave you feeling dirty, feeling depressed and maybe even feeling bad about yourself but I feel that in the right context these are all good feelings for us to have because they force us to consider things we may never make the time to consider.Drug addiction is painted in most films as devastating but beatable, something that can ruin lives but can be overcome.  In so many movies today we watch our main character suffer at the hands of his addiction only to watch him rise above and overcome the adversary, turning over a new leaf and moving forward on a new path.  If that is what you are expecting to see then be forewarned, there are no happy endings to be found in `Requiem...'.  In fact, `Requiem for a Dream' paints this picture so harshly, so unsympathetically one is forced to realize that not all addictions are beatable.  Sometimes, well, most of the time there is no coming back.  The reason I feel that `Requiem for a Dream' is such an important film is because it shows the audience the ugly truth behind a very common and widespread problem.  You won't walk away from this movie and think lightly of the occasional drug run.  You won't think that there's nothing wrong with a high here or there.  You will be repulsed by the very idea of a manufactured euphoria and will cringe at the thought of ending up like any of the characters portrayed in this film.This film is designed to prevent drug abuse.The film follows the lives of four individuals all connected to one another.  You have Sara Goldfarb, an elderly lady who lives really for nothing except the off chance that she could be on television.  She watches her game shows and thinks of nothing else.  Her son Harry is so dependant of drugs that he's willing to steal his mother's belongings to get the money for a high.  His best friend Tyrone is just as guilty and his girlfriend Marion is along for the ride.  The film follows each of their addictions (Sara becomes addicted to diet pills in an attempt to lose enough weight to fit in a dress she's determined to wear on television) and fleshes out the pain, degradation and hopelessness each addiction leaves it's host in.What helps propel this film along is the stellar performances by the entire cast, most notably its two leading ladies.  Ellen Burstyn rightfully was awarded a Best Actress nomination at the Oscars for her brilliant portrayal of Sara.  She really gets inside this woman and makes her delusions so real to the audience.  She takes something that could have, in the wrong hands, gone camp or been comical and makes it so raw and emotionally stimulating.  Her pain is essentially our pain and this makes the film so much more real to us.  Jennifer Connelly is flawlessly stunning as Marion Silver.  Her character has such a subtle yet moving arch towards the closing of the film when we watch her desperation grow to the point of no return.  It's heartbreaking but also extremely realistic.  Jared Leto is also remarkable here.  He has a lot of misses as an actor but when he hits it he hits it out of the park.  His portrayal of Harry is emotional and resilient.  Marlon Wayans blew me away.  I didn't know he had this in him, but he succeeds with flying colors at making his character real and moving.  I still can't get over this performance, so utterly unexpected.A lot has been said for Aronofsky's visionary style.  I'm going to say a little bit now.  His direction of this film is a perfect compliment to the subject and depiction he was going for.  The chaotic editing helps keep the audience in the right frame of mind, further embellishing the mental state of our protagonists.  As we watch the screen shift back and forth violently with each depiction of drug intake we get the sense that this is really destroying the characters from the inside out.  Aronofsky expressed brilliant judgment in his decisions while making this film.So, like I mentioned earlier, this is not a film for everyone.  It is brutal in many ways and very hard to watch both emotionally and visually if you are not prepared for it.  If you can sit through this masterpiece though I highly recommend it because it's a film unlike any other and one that we all should take notice of.",5,Dark and unsettling yet richly rewarding...,1196985600,"12 7, 2007",2007,4682,"['ever', 'was', 'movie', 'exposed', 'drug', 'addiction', 'horror', 'truly', 'film', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'understandably', 'very', 'hard', 'film', 'watch', 'Everything', 'intense', 'subject', 'matter', 'sporadic', 'chaotic', 'direction', 'set', 'draw', 'push', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'be', 'film', 'love', 'wholeheartedly', 'loathe', 'consider', 'waste', 'time', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'dirty', 'feeling', 'depressed', 'maybe', 'even', 'feeling', 'bad', 'feel', 'right', 'context', 'are', 'good', 'feelings', 'have', 'force', 'consider', 'things', 'may', 'never', 'make', 'time', 'consider.Drug', 'addiction', 'painted', 'most', 'films', 'devastating', 'beatable', 'something', 'can', 'ruin', 'lives', 'can', 'be', 'overcome', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'today', 'watch', 'main', 'character', 'suffer', 'hands', 'addiction', 'only', 'watch', 'rise', 'overcome', 'adversary', 'turning', 'over', 'new', 'leaf', 'moving', 'forward', 'new', 'path', 'what', 'are', 'expecting', 'see', 'then', 'be', 'forewarned', 'are', 'happy', 'endings', 'be', 'found', 'Requiem', 'fact', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'paints', 'picture', 'so', 'harshly', 'so', 'unsympathetically', 'one', 'forced', 'realize', 'not', 'addictions', 'are', 'beatable', 'Sometimes', 'well', 'most', 'time', 'coming', 'back', 'reason', 'feel', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'such', 'important', 'film', 'audience', 'ugly', 'truth', 'very', 'common', 'widespread', 'problem', 'wo', ""n't"", 'walk', 'away', 'movie', 'think', 'lightly', 'occasional', 'drug', 'run', 'wo', ""n't"", 'think', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'high', 'here', 'there', 'will', 'be', 'repulsed', 'very', 'idea', 'manufactured', 'euphoria', 'will', 'cringe', 'thought', 'ending', 'up', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'film.This', 'film', 'designed', 'prevent', 'drug', 'abuse.The', 'film', 'lives', 'four', 'individuals', 'connected', 'one', 'have', 'Sara', 'Goldfarb', 'elderly', 'lady', 'who', 'really', 'nothing', 'off', 'chance', 'could', 'be', 'television', 'game', 'shows', 'thinks', 'nothing', 'else', 'son', 'Harry', 'so', 'dependant', 'drugs', 'willing', 'steal', 'mother', 'belongings', 'get', 'money', 'high', 'best', 'friend', 'Tyrone', 'just', 'guilty', 'girlfriend', 'Marion', 'along', 'ride', 'film', 'addictions', 'Sara', 'becomes', 'addicted', 'diet', 'pills', 'attempt', 'lose', 'enough', 'weight', 'fit', 'dress', 'determined', 'wear', 'television', 'out', 'pain', 'degradation', 'hopelessness', 'addiction', 'host', 'in.What', 'propel', 'film', 'along', 'stellar', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'most', 'notably', 'two', 'leading', 'ladies', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'rightfully', 'was', 'awarded', 'Best', 'Actress', 'nomination', 'Oscars', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'Sara', 'really', 'woman', 'delusions', 'so', 'real', 'audience', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'wrong', 'hands', 'gone', 'camp', 'been', 'comical', 'raw', 'emotionally', 'stimulating', 'pain', 'essentially', 'pain', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'real', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'flawlessly', 'stunning', 'Marion', 'Silver', 'character', 'such', 'subtle', 'yet', 'moving', 'arch', 'closing', 'film', 'when', 'watch', 'desperation', 'grow', 'point', 'return', 'heartbreaking', 'also', 'extremely', 'realistic', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'also', 'remarkable', 'here', 'lot', 'misses', 'actor', 'when', 'park', 'portrayal', 'Harry', 'emotional', 'resilient', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'blew', 'away', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'flying', 'colors', 'making', 'character', 'real', 'moving', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'performance', 'so', 'utterly', 'unexpected.A', 'lot', 'been', 'said', 'Aronofsky', 'visionary', 'style', ""'m"", 'going', 'say', 'little', 'bit', 'now', 'direction', 'film', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'subject', 'depiction', 'was', 'going', 'chaotic', 'editing', 'keep', 'audience', 'right', 'frame', 'mind', 'further', 'embellishing', 'mental', 'state', 'protagonists', 'watch', 'screen', 'shift', 'back', 'violently', 'depiction', 'drug', 'intake', 'get', 'sense', 'really', 'destroying', 'characters', 'inside', 'Aronofsky', 'expressed', 'brilliant', 'judgment', 'decisions', 'making', 'film.So', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'brutal', 'many', 'ways', 'very', 'hard', 'watch', 'emotionally', 'visually', 'are', 'not', 'prepared', 'can', 'sit', 'masterpiece', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'other', 'one', 'should', 'take', 'notice']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

As it turns out, one of the main characters is hawking his mother's television set to pay for his habit. By the end of the film, his mother will have developed a habit as well, from seemingly innocuous beginnings.After the relative silence and lightness of the early scenes the film begins to develop a darker, much more aggressive and hopelessly bleak march, climaxing with rapid cut scenes of the characters' interwoven stories that show the impending moral and emotional deaths of each. The cinematography is powerfully executed and the rising, harrowing soundtrack becomes a metaphor for the rising sense of hopelesness that permeates every frame. Five star composition.My only gripe is with the plot. There are four major characters in this film, each of them an addict. While the junkie lifestyle certainly has its pitfalls each of these characters somehow happens on the worst of all possible circumstances at every crossroads.The script could have been satisfied with the demonstrations that junkies often end up serving for posession or that junkies often end up turning tricks to support their habit. There was no need to take the heavy-handed approach. In this world, black junkies from Brooklyn go to all-white Klan-run prisons in the south, young wealthy female addicts end up in live lesbian S&amp;M shows for chanting mobs of white-collar criminals, and aging suburbanites with amphetamine prescriptions end up getting electroshock therapy until they're vegetative.

530776,A3PYIMNF2QJHE,B00003CXP1,Ashley,"[3, 4]","Addiction. I'm sure everyone has felt an addiction to something or other. Caffeine, chocolate, tv, sex and drugs, even, but there's such a rainbow of things people can feel addicted to. I have never seen addiction portrayed in a better, more haunting way than it's done in this movie. It may seem easy to not sympathize for these characters. ""It's their own fault they got all muddled up in drugs, that could never be me,"" or ""this movie is stupid, the entire plot is about letting yourself go deeper and deeper into despair."" That may just be ignorance talking from someone who clearly doesn't understand just what addiction can do to people. This is a movie that's not supposed to be about confusing you with twists and turns and a whole gigantic plot that you didn't see coming, but it's supposed to make you feel, make you think, make you reminisce about your own life and the lives of those you love. It does just that perfectly.Take Jared Leto, for example. Most people only see him as this one-dimensional guy who just happens to have a popular, talented band. They may not have realized that the skeletal Harry Goldfarb is actually Mr. Leto himself in a heart-wrenching role played to perfection. And ""whoa isn't that the guy from those Scary Movie films?"" Yes, yes it is. Ellen Burstyn was robbed of the Oscar that year, in my opinion, her story may just have been the saddest one yet. She deals with feelings of abandonment, self-worth, and loss.This is a movie with a message that's more than ""drugs are bad, k? Don't stick things in your arm."" We all learned this in the fourth grade. It's obvious. If a movie just pounded that into your head, I don't think it would be as well-liked as Requiem For A Dream is. The same can be said for the novel as well, really, which is also completely fascinating. There are differences between book and film, of course, but it's certainly one of the best book-to-movie endeavors. If you're easily squeamish or have a closed mind you may not like this film, but you really should give it a go.

530779,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00003CXP1,Austin Somlo,"[3, 4]","Viewed: 7/07, 6/11Rate: 107/07: The movie starts off slowly in a dumb way that would have resembled an ordinary picture, but its freefall into despair is extraordinary. The infusion of style through Requiem for a Dream makes it an unforgettable picture. Quite possibly Requiem for a Dream may be the most haunting picture I've seen. The performances, save for Marlon Wayans, are thoroughly outstanding. There have been some pictures that deal with drug use and chemical dependency, and quite many of them glorify the shattering experience. But Requiem for a Dream is the exception. It elevates the elements of Sid and Nancy while incorporating the motivation with regard for neither nihilism nor gratification. No question, the most outstanding performance of the picture is Ellen Burstyn as she combines the delicacy of Vivien Leigh from A Streetcar Named Desire with the madness of Bette Davis from What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? Jared Leto is an actor of limited abilities, but in this one, he digs deep and pushes himself farther than he has never been. For Jennifer Connelly, she is usually a blank person with a lot of faade that turned in many mediocre performances, but in this one, she fits in flawlessly of her role and transforms herself into the character that blended in what the content demands. A veteran of many bad, bad movies, Marlon Wayans makes an appearance in a film that's quite unlike him, and he does well staying within the level of others. Is it the performances that make Requiem for a Dream the picture it is, or is it the work of a director? Hmm, I think it's more of the latter. Darren Aronofsky shows that he had learned a great deal from his first picture Pi and transfers its style into Requiem for a Dream plus adding more inventive ways to take his vision to the next level. The result is a smashing one. It starts off, as I said, leisurely, begins its ascent with endearing performances, and lights up a fuse that promises to explode with lots of fireworks. When all are said and done, the effect of the picture has stayed with me mentally because it becomes, to a certain extent, impacting. Requiem for a Dream is a film that is waiting to be recognized as a venerable classic in decades to come, and it deserves to be held in high esteem. It's so unlike anything I've seen. I think that the movie had enough to make a compelling in-look of what would happen to a person if s/he started to get into hardcore drugs. Yeah, Traffic fails to portray it because Steven Soderbergh spent his time excessively juggling with so many characters in an overly ambitious picture. Darren Aronofsky avoids that mistake by keeping the characters small and simple. It is also at the point that their past backgrounds ceased to matter, so I am instructed to watch the decaying effects of the present characters to the point of finality. I must say, the title Requiem for a Dream is very intriguing. To dream of something big is to swap for something else just like how Dr. Faustus did? Seems to be like it. Some of the scenes in Requiem for a Dream are painful for me to watch, but I saw every second of it. When I could think of the most hollowing part, it has to be either the black circular bruise on Jared Leto's arm or the double sodomy sex scene in a machine gun rapidity. Giving the film a `10', it is easy for me to do so because when a film fails to invoke feelings, then it is not considered a good picture. But Requiem for a Dream pretty much takes away all of that from me, and I may have been speechless already afterwards. Surely, to show evidence, the fact is I usually write a review the day after I finish the movie, but for Requiem for a Dream, it is three days after. I may have to wait years before I will take interest in watching it again. To repeat, Ellen Burstyn's performance may be just the best of her career.6/11: Requiem for a Dream is the ultimate anti-drug picture. Show this to kids, and you'll get the desired effect because I don't know, except for junkies, who can not be repelled by Jared Leto's black circled arm. Also, it is the ultimate ADD picture because of the extensive editing where an average film would have 600 to 700 cuts, but Requiem for a Dream had 2,000 of it. I just love the camera style throughout; it's bold and innovative. The pacing is extremely fast and to the point, magnifying the extremeness per scene by 10 fold. As a result, the ending is one depressing maniac finish. Although the cast does very well collectively, it's Ellen Burstyn's show. She steals every scene and makes for one sad, pathetic character. If there is a reason not to do drugs, legal or illegal, and then abuse them, see Requiem for a Dream. It's worth every second. Forget the idea that there are extreme scenes; the film is meant to tackle an extreme subject in an extreme way. All in all, Requiem for a Dream is forever a classic.",5,Can You Look Away????,1308528000,"06 20, 2011",2011,4887,"['Viewed', '7/07', '6/11Rate', '107/07', 'movie', 'off', 'slowly', 'dumb', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'resembled', 'ordinary', 'picture', 'freefall', 'despair', 'extraordinary', 'infusion', 'style', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'unforgettable', 'picture', 'Quite', 'possibly', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'haunting', 'picture', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'performances', 'save', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'outstanding', 'have', 'been', 'pictures', 'deal', 'drug', 'use', 'chemical', 'dependency', 'quite', 'many', 'glorify', 'shattering', 'experience', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'exception', 'elements', 'Sid', 'Nancy', 'incorporating', 'motivation', 'regard', 'nihilism', 'gratification', 'question', 'most', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'picture', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'delicacy', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'madness', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'What', 'Ever', 'Happened', 'Baby', 'Jane', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'actor', 'limited', 'abilities', 'one', 'deep', 'pushes', 'farther', 'never', 'been', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'usually', 'blank', 'person', 'lot', 'faade', 'turned', 'many', 'mediocre', 'performances', 'one', 'flawlessly', 'role', 'transforms', 'character', 'blended', 'what', 'content', 'A', 'veteran', 'many', 'bad', 'bad', 'movies', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'appearance', 'film', 'quite', 'well', 'staying', 'level', 'others', 'performances', 'make', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'picture', 'work', 'director', 'Hmm', 'think', 'more', 'latter', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'had', 'learned', 'great', 'deal', 'first', 'picture', 'Pi', 'style', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'adding', 'more', 'inventive', 'ways', 'take', 'vision', 'next', 'level', 'result', 'smashing', 'one', 'off', 'said', 'leisurely', 'ascent', 'endearing', 'performances', 'up', 'fuse', 'explode', 'lots', 'fireworks', 'When', 'are', 'said', 'done', 'effect', 'picture', 'stayed', 'mentally', 'certain', 'extent', 'impacting', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'film', 'waiting', 'be', 'recognized', 'venerable', 'classic', 'decades', 'come', 'be', 'held', 'high', 'esteem', 'so', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'think', 'movie', 'had', 'enough', 'make', 'compelling', 'in-look', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'person', 's/he', 'started', 'get', 'hardcore', 'drugs', 'Yeah', 'Traffic', 'portray', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'spent', 'time', 'excessively', 'juggling', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'overly', 'ambitious', 'picture', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'avoids', 'mistake', 'keeping', 'characters', 'small', 'simple', 'also', 'point', 'past', 'backgrounds', 'ceased', 'matter', 'am', 'instructed', 'watch', 'decaying', 'effects', 'present', 'characters', 'point', 'finality', 'must', 'say', 'title', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'very', 'intriguing', 'dream', 'something', 'big', 'swap', 'something', 'else', 'just', 'how', 'Dr.', 'Faustus', 'did', 'Seems', 'be', 'scenes', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'are', 'painful', 'watch', 'saw', 'second', 'When', 'could', 'think', 'most', 'hollowing', 'part', 'be', 'either', 'black', 'circular', 'bruise', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'arm', 'double', 'sodomy', 'sex', 'scene', 'machine', 'gun', 'rapidity', 'Giving', 'film', '10', 'easy', 'do', 'so', 'when', 'film', 'invoke', 'feelings', 'then', 'not', 'considered', 'good', 'picture', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'pretty', 'much', 'away', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'speechless', 'already', 'afterwards', 'Surely', 'show', 'evidence', 'fact', 'usually', 'write', 'review', 'day', 'finish', 'movie', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'three', 'days', 'may', 'have', 'wait', 'years', 'will', 'take', 'interest', 'watching', 'again', 'repeat', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'performance', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'best', 'career.6/11', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'ultimate', 'anti-drug', 'picture', 'Show', 'kids', ""'ll"", 'get', 'desired', 'effect', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'junkies', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'repelled', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'black', 'circled', 'arm', 'Also', 'ultimate', 'ADD', 'picture', 'extensive', 'editing', 'where', 'average', 'film', 'would', 'have', '600', '700', 'cuts', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'had', '2,000', 'just', 'love', 'camera', 'style', 'bold', 'innovative', 'pacing', 'extremely', 'fast', 'point', 'magnifying', 'extremeness', 'scene', '10', 'fold', 'result', 'ending', 'one', 'depressing', 'maniac', 'finish', 'cast', 'very', 'well', 'collectively', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'show', 'scene', 'one', 'sad', 'pathetic', 'character', 'reason', 'not', 'do', 'drugs', 'legal', 'illegal', 'then', 'abuse', 'see', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'worth', 'second', 'Forget', 'idea', 'are', 'extreme', 'scenes', 'film', 'meant', 'tackle', 'extreme', 'subject', 'extreme', 'way', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'forever', 'classic']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

Darren Aronofsky repeats his seven-rapid-repeated shots technique from Pi in this painful film, ""Requiem for a Dream"" adapted from a story by Hubert Selby Jr. by Selby and Aronofsky. He also plays tribute to the shot of Jennifer Connelly at the end of a pier from Proyas's ""Dark City"" (it is even the same pier).The film is painful to watch, but difficult to call ""beautiful,"" for it fails to say anything new. Its soul message: drug addiction dehumanizes you and kills relationships. This film documents four character's abandonment of hope, and ends at the twilight of their despair.The four principal actors do excellent jobs, and in a better world Ellen Burstyn's performance would have been carved out of this film's context and awarded an Oscar. Jennifer Connelly also delivers an excellent understated performance of how drug addiction can affect the shallow.Sara Goldfarb (Burstyn) is a lonely widow who has invested all her dreams in the success of her worthless son Harry (Jared Leto), and passes her days fixed on television. In a dream of some self-fulfillment, she hopes to go on television herself, and begins a prescription drug diet plan at the hands of an unscrupulous doctor. Hell follows, and Burstyn's performance is so realistic you will weep real tears.Harry is a wastrel crack fiend with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) (her attraction to the colorless Harry is never explained, and to me is unlikely).

Morris ""BeansMommy""","[0, 2]","The acting in this movie is AWESOME !!!The film revolves around 4 people.The characters are Ellen Burnstein (who plays the mom) Her son(Jared Leto), her son's best friend(Marlon Wayans), and her son's girlfriend(Jennifer Connely).The son and friend start out selling drugs, and become thier own best customers,the girlfriend also becomes addicted, followed by the Mom.She starts taking prescribed diet pills to lose weight, because she believes that she is going to appear on a talk show and wants to fit in a particular red dress, and her 'dieting' does start out innocent enough.As this movie progresses we watch them become empty shells of who they used to be throughout a one year time period, as thier addictions progress.(The film is shot in 4 parts, 4 seasons:Winter,Spring,Summer and Fall)It starts in the spring andby the time Winter comes around, they are all living in thier personal hells as full blown addicts. Mom on her ""legal"" prescription speed, and the other 3 on Herion.The acting in this film is top rank.I think it is right on the money the depths to which these four sink.Addiction is not a pretty thing,and even though the empty shells of the addicts they become is disgusting to watch, it is also hard to turn away.The Mother's ""bottom"" that she hits in her addiction will make you cry, you just have to see it to believe it. And I felt the most sorry for her character too, because she was so naive' and  innocent when she began taking the prescribed diet pills, and because they WERE prescribed, she didn't see anything wrong with her use, and it continued until she was a raving lunatic at about 70 pounds, and getting shock treatments.We witness all 4 characters in thier spiral downward, and it is very sad to see.I will have to say that it is about the most depressing movie I ever saw, but this is not totally a bad thing, as there is a lesson to be learned, and that lesson is that no matter who you are,rich or poor, black or white, girl or guy: ANYone can become an addict.Some make it back from the bottom, and others don't.That is the reality of the situation, and this movie captures that perfectly.",5,A raw  (and realistic)  look at addictions.,1163721600,"11 17, 2006",2006,2136,"['acting', 'movie', 'AWESOME', 'film', '4', 'people.The', 'characters', 'are', 'Ellen', 'Burnstein', 'who', 'mom', 'son', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'son', 'best', 'friend', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'son', 'girlfriend', 'Jennifer', 'Connely', '.The', 'son', 'friend', 'start', 'selling', 'drugs', 'become', 'thier', 'own', 'best', 'customers', 'girlfriend', 'also', 'becomes', 'addicted', 'followed', 'Mom.She', 'taking', 'prescribed', 'diet', 'pills', 'lose', 'weight', 'going', 'appear', 'talk', 'show', 'fit', 'particular', 'red', 'dress', ""'dieting"", 'start', 'out', 'innocent', 'enough.As', 'movie', 'watch', 'become', 'empty', 'shells', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'one', 'year', 'time', 'period', 'thier', 'addictions', 'progress', 'film', 'shot', '4', 'parts', '4', 'seasons', 'Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall', 'spring', 'time', 'Winter', 'around', 'are', 'living', 'thier', 'personal', 'hells', 'full', 'blown', 'addicts', 'Mom', 'legal', 'prescription', 'speed', 'other', '3', 'Herion.The', 'acting', 'film', 'top', 'rank.I', 'think', 'right', 'money', 'depths', 'four', 'sink.Addiction', 'not', 'pretty', 'thing', 'even', 'empty', 'shells', 'addicts', 'become', 'disgusting', 'watch', 'also', 'hard', 'turn', 'away.The', 'Mother', 'bottom', 'addiction', 'will', 'make', 'cry', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'believe', 'felt', 'most', 'sorry', 'character', 'too', 'was', 'so', 'naive', 'innocent', 'when', 'began', 'taking', 'prescribed', 'diet', 'pills', 'WERE', 'prescribed', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'wrong', 'use', 'continued', 'was', 'raving', 'lunatic', '70', 'pounds', 'getting', 'shock', 'treatments.We', '4', 'characters', 'thier', 'spiral', 'downward', 'very', 'sad', 'see.I', 'will', 'have', 'say', 'most', 'depressing', 'movie', 'ever', 'saw', 'not', 'totally', 'bad', 'thing', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'lesson', 'matter', 'who', 'are', 'rich', 'poor', 'black', 'white', 'girl', 'guy', 'ANYone', 'can', 'become', 'addict.Some', 'make', 'back', 'bottom', 'others', 'reality', 'situation', 'movie', 'perfectly']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

It is not a story told to lightly touch on the subject of addiction.  Instead the entire film is living in the life of an addict with nothing held back.  Being in recovery I see how true to life this film is.  It starts right off with our main characters using.  We have Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly all giving the performances of a lifetime.  The characters are likable and shown in enough of a perspective that we can care for them but the downward spiral that will continue throughout the fim begins right at the start.  Jared and Jennifer are boyfriend and girlfriend shooting up to escape, get a high or just relax.  Ellen Burstyn is the mother who goes to the doctor to get pills to help loose weight.  All starts innocent enough but the film quickly turns into the never ending descent into hell that is the life of an addict.  It realistically shows how what one thinks is a chosen act for escape becomes a psychological and physical addiction for which the user will do anything.  The hell they endure is self inflicted but they cannot stop due to the addiction.  This movie is scarier than any thriller or stalker film for it is about real life.  Many don't want to see or even imagine the life of a true drug addict and the ends to which our characters go to get their drug gets more and more horrific as the film goes on.  The scariest part of it is that it is all a realistic portrayal of the life of an addict.  There is no joy here.  The film is a descent into hell and it ends with a wallop.  For most one viewing will be enough for this film.  It is a masterpiece but how often does one choose to go to hell.On the other side, this film truly is a masterpiece.  Even though it is 10 years old it is the most honest, realistic depiction of drug addiction ever on film.  The reason to view this film again is the amazing performances by the main three and the superb directing by Darren Aronofsky.  The blu ray transfer is amazing.  You would never guess that the film is 10 years old and the transfer makes all the colors crisper and video more vivid.  The audio is amazing.  Bottom line, the blu ray transfer holds strong to the integrity of the film. It is grainy where need be and the clarity to the rest brings the message and horror of this film that much stronger.  I highly recommend this film.  Be prepared and aware of what you will be viewing.  This is a tough fim to watch - bottom line.  But it is an amazing film and when a film  so honestly and truthfully tackles such a difficult subject you must view it.  And as I said, you will be so awe struck by the performances that you may want to view it again.  The blu ray version is superb.  The film is hardcore and an experience you will never forget.

I had seen many movies about this subject matter, but this one, and only this one, managed to knock you out, making you watch even though you wanted to turn away.What makes &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; a great movie exactly. Well, everything about it. From Aronofsky and Selby's script up, this movie is pretty close to flawless.The acting is indeed flawless. Ellen Burstyn should be suing the Academy for giving Julia Roverts her award. This is a performance that shoudl be studied, and is one of the best in the history of movies. Jared Leto, from here on out loses his &quot;poor man's Johnny Depp&quot; stigma with a great performance. Both Jennifer Connoly(the last few minutes of her story pretty much sucked away my will to live for a few hours after the movie) and Marlon Wayans(???) completement the leading cast perfectly in understated performnaces.Arnofsky uses all the tricks in his bag, and uses them well.

Imagine students' reactions to the graphic display of the torture that drugs and addiction/obsession induce. Films such as Requiem For A Dream, American History X, Kids, Bully, and American Beauty are often frowned upon by society because they are merely holding up a mirror. Society never likes to see what it truly is. When the ignorant and soft-centered hypocrites are finally woken up to a real look at our society towering films, such as this will get their just rewards.Just for starters, Ellen Burstyn. I would love to meet the people who voted Julia Roberts Best Actress in 2000 and have them watch this film again. A powerful and deeply gripping performance is given here. Easily her best since ""The Exorcist"" or ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" (the film that captured her first Oscar). Portraying a woman whose obsession with a diet program, a red dress, and her social image can only bring the worst for her.Jared Leto gives an equally powerful performance as her son, Harry. A young drug-dealer who struggles at his mother's question ""how is your work going?"" I mean, who could look their elderly mother in the eye and say, ""It's great, I deal drugs."" A sickening addiction to heroine and its grisly consequences leave the viewer inspired and hopefully enlightened.Jennifer Connelly was certainly overlooked at the Oscars as well. An Oscar-worthy performance certainly is given in this film. Marianne, whom will do just about anything for what her mind desires. The rage in her eyes and the burning in her tone bring the viewer as close to the mind of a sickened, sexual drug addict as is possible.Finally, Marlon Wayans. Who knew he could act? He gives an absolute amazing performance in this film as Harry's friend Tyrone. He gives a small yet adequate dose of humor that prevents the film from being 2 hours of depressing cinema.Darren Aronofsky brilliantly directs this, certainly an Oscar-worthy directing job throughout. Various new techniques are employed, split screen scenes, sudden fast motion, slow motion, and just about simultaneously showing 3 different scenes at the same time make this a trip that the view will not easily forget.Finally, Clint Mansel's menacing score is a must-have. A simple theme is repeated but altered enough that you don't get sick of it. Haunting synthesizers and a special performance from the Kronos quartet dominates this film.So, I find that when films like this are released, society shuts them away because we don't wanna hear what's wrong with us today. Well, we can't fix what is wrong until filmmaker's like Darren Aronofsky, Tony Kaye, and Sam Mendes truly and brutally show us.

530788,A2YAABMT80RLYA,B00003CXP1,Ben Rowland,"[3, 4]","There are two kinds of drug movies: movies that depict drug abuse as a trandy undertaking, and movies that show it as a descructive force in every life it becomes part of. Darren Aronofsky's ""Requeim for a Dream"" takes the later option, pointing to the clear lesson that drugs are a dead end, with a benefit that is only in the short term.At the center of the movie is Sara (Ellen Burstyn, is a knockout role), as a lonley widow who, following the path of her heroin-addicted son (Jared Leto), becomes addicted to drugs in order to loose weight for her appearence on a tv talk show. Her slow descent into madness and drug addiction is the most disturbing aspect of this film. Leto's character has his own problems, with his years of addiction and selling only reap minimal results, and he and his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) must survive and feed their addiction, which ultimately ruins them.The movie is filled with symbolic nuances, like the drug taking montage and the surreal editing which drives the viewer into the same depth of madness as the characters. This is further tempered with spurts of graphic violence. ""Requiem for a Dream"" succeeds as a character study, and pushes the bar further in terms of depicting the horror of drug abuse. Unlike Trainspotting, which is trendy and upbeat, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a depressing, often upsetting experience for some viewers. Personally, I think it is a pure work of art. With so many druggie movies, it is nice to see that Darren Aronofsky cares as much about building characters rather than making a music video, as was Trainspotting (mind you, I loved Trainspotting too).For this movie, the DVD Director's Cut is the only format to go with.

Cinematography rocks.  But I really wasn't blown away by it.  I was unnerved by it, and that is most definitely what Aronofsky was shooting for, and therefore it's a successful film, but I'm not putting it on My List.  Maybe ""Pi"" - maybe - but not this.  This movie just seems kind of unnecessary.  Did we really need another drug-glam-death movie?  Its images are appropriately revolting: the brain-splattered face of a fugitive Marlon Wayans, the gangrenous injection site of a smacked-out Jared Leto, the krypt-keeper complexion of a detoxing Ellen Burstyn, etc.  She deserves some props for being able to let go like that, by the way.  And cinematographically we are made to empathize with her the most.  We get more from her POV under the influence of crazy diet pills, with the trails and sound-distortions, than we do when Jared and Jennifer slam coke or heroin and we watch them in 3rd-person as they buzz around the room or gush sickening dope-tripe to each other.  But none of it is necessary.  I've seen this before - all of it.  It's done exceptionally well here, and that probably should be enough, and maybe it will be in the long run.  Or maybe Aronofsky just raised the bar too high with ""Pi"" to chase it with an exceptional treatment of a run-of-the-mill story.  I mean, we all know what's gonna go down here.  Naive old lady, slightly wild young kids.  Drugs.  Old lady starts popping pills prescribed by shifty physician cuz she thinks she's going on TV and she wants to be able to fit into her red dress and feel like a worthwhile person.  Young kids start chipping on C&H; cuz they deal it, cuz they're trying to get out of Coney, and how do they know how much to cut if they don't sample the wares.  The ironic thing is that they are all fundamentally well-intentioned.They're doomed.It's way more brutal than any War On Drugs campaign I've ever seen (except that really sickening ""I fund terrorism"" one), but the ""message"" is essentially identical, even though this film seems to speak from first-hand experience with substance abuse.  Stylistically it excels.  It's extremely depressing.  My arm literally started hurting when I watched it.  It's grim and unflinching and unconsoling.  It doesn't really suggest that anybody should've or could've done anything differently - this is just what happens.Like I said at first, I don't know.  My reaction is probably more emotional than anything: the film is effective, but I don't want to put myself through watching it again.  All I can really get out of it in the end is ""don't do drugs"" or at best ""if you do drugs you're playing with fire.""I will admit one thing though - the ""infomercial"" menu did screw me up.  I thought I still had the TV on, I didn't even bother to read the flashing text, I just visually revolted and wondered why I couldn't change channels.  hahaP.S.

Her dream of being on television (her only companion) seems to be answered when a phonecall tells her that she has been chosen to appear on a gameshow. There's only one problem. Sara no longer fits into her red dress! Thus begins the torture of dieting, which leads to pills, addiction, and ultimate destruction. Sara's son (Jared Leto from AMERICAN PSYCHO, PANIC ROOM) is a heroin addict (among other substances). He and his friend (Marlon Wayans) just want to make that final ""big score"" so they can ""go straight"". Unfortunately, life just doesn't work that way. Marian (Jennifer Connelly from DARK CITY, HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG) is the addicted girlfriend. Her dream of turning her dress designs into a career is torched by her own hunger for various pills and powders. This is the story of human weakness in the face of overwhelming temptation.

It is strange, becuase there is no real hero in this film.  The hero seems to be their addictions to their dreams.  Everytime they are doing good, they fall flat on their faces, and worse, are spit on by the people around them.  Libatique and Aronofsky teaming up with classis novelist Sleby Jr., seems odd, but they are all epxerts in what they do, and they made something that will become a standard in every way.

Well let me tell you this, the film made me and my date actually cry a couple of times. The Ellen Burstyn monologue in the middle of the movie, about being alone, wins the Oscar for her. Julia Roberts? Whatever. It would be a shame if the academy mistaked her clevage baring and mega watt smile for acting in &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;, and ignored Ellen.Another flick garnering raves is &quot;Traffic&quot;, a longer, all star flick, that after watching &quot;Requiem&quot; bored me. It paled in comparrison to &quot;Requiem&quot;. Jared Leto, looking very emaciated also plays his part very well. He shows how desperate a drug addled person can be. I don't like revealing too much in my reviews, but those who saw it, the scene in the car when Jared revealed his arm to Marlon Wayans was disgusting, but I could not keep my eyes away from the screen. Jennifer Connely also turns a shockingly great performance. The film I really remember her from is &quot;Labyrinth&quot;. With this movie she proves she does indeed have acting chops, The scene where she goes to her therapists apartment made me feel for her. Marlon Wayans, after a horrifically awful performance in &quot;Scary Movie&quot; rebounds with a steady performance here. The scene about him not letting his mom down was sweet and sad. This performance should help him shed his goofball image. But with &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot; comming out he is just moving backward again.Now all my praises to Darren Aronofsky. A man who should win Best Director. His subject matter was harsh, he picked under the radar stars, he adapted the story from a book, and did it all very well. This guy knows what he is doing. The movie is very vivid and to me looked real. I live in NYC and I have seen people affected by drug use. And I know that rarely there is a happy ending. Like &quot;Traffic&quot; with it's stupid Michael Douglas ending about his daughter, who was a super addict having ... for ...., who then turns out to be chipper and happy in the end.

530806,A1F3GOUFG7Y73U,B00003CXP1,B. Son,"[1, 2]","A portrayal of life in its beauty, harshness, it's pure form of reality. It's dark, haunting, and depressing. The little joys in life is something we all share, as well as the indifferent, and the evil. A brutal assault of images, scenes, and memories.The definition of requiem is a mass for the dead, in this film's title, a mass for the death of dreams. Each character in this movie has their own desire.We all have dreams, as do the characters in this film. Sara Goldfarb played amazingly by Ellen Burstyn, is the mother of Harry (Jay Leto). Now a elderly widow living on her own, she has nothing but infomercials as her companion. Harry is a drug addict, getting by on unknown monetary means, using what little money he does have for riding taxis and buying drugs. Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) plays his best friend and his girlfriend is played is Marion (Jennifer Connelly).Sara gets a call that she is eligible to win for a spot on the show that she religiously watches. She belives she will get a chance to be on the show, something she is dreaming of. Wanting to fit into a dress, that she had worn years ago to her son's high school graduation, so that she may wear it on the show. She attempts to follow a diet to lose weight to no avail. The cravings are too strong and she resorts to taking advice from her friend: diet pills prescribed through a doctor. She wants nothing but to be on the show, to be loved by millions through telvision, to have them love her son, to love her husband. Being able to wear the dress to her is being young again, to be thin again, to regain the feeling she got from being with her husband. An escape from her lonely reality to one where all her wishes come true.Harry, Tyrone, and Marion do drugs together and are dependant on them. Harry and Tyrone try to sell drugs to make more money. Marion is an artist and Harry wants to open a space for her drawings. He is attempting to make money to open the space so they may achieve this as well as be together. Tyrone seems to only share one memory of his mother as a child that seems to plague him increasingly. Harry wants nothing but the ones he loves to be happy: his mother and his girlfriend. Tyrone longs for his mother's arms. Marion is detatched and has nothing but money.With amazing director direction and cinematography, the story increases in its drama and intensity. A roller coaster of their lives, drugs and addictions, their individual dreams all leading into a fall that is inevitable-- that some might not be able to handle. Only turning for a requiem, for all their dreams.So much emphasis put on drugs, though that is the vehicle on which their troubles ride, is not the entire movie. Whatever it is, is for you to see in this film.It is traumatic to watch, yet fulfilling. Because of its highly graphic and extremely difficult content, it is only recommended for those who can handle it. The director's cut leaves nothing out, the full edit of constant scenes that lead to the group of character's downfalls and leaving you stunned and speechless.

If ever a viewer wondered about the interior state of being of drug addiction, this is the movie for you. Aronofsky used Hubert Selby Jr.'s book and screenplay as his source material and the source material is brilliant.I love movies which explore surreal states.  This must come in part from my fascination with surrealist art. Aronofsky's film probably owes more to the late Salvador Dali than to any other film director. I'm also fascinated by movies which move as if you were viewing them in a dream state.  We do spend a great deal of our lives in a dream state and see life from an entirely different perspective in REM time. Aronofsky seems to understand this very well. Aronofsky and Selby, in intended irony, load their characters with dreams of their own which are destined to remain unfilled in large part because of their drug addictions.Ellen Burstyn plays the easiest addict to understand and she does her usual masterful job.  She wants to lose weight so takes diet pills (speed) to do so.  Her dream is to be on tv which is what spurs her to the speed. Her son Harry, his girlfriend Marion, and his best friend Tyrone use the outright illegal street drugs and dream of becoming big drug dealers instead of low level pushers.  On the way to drug fortune, they themselves become addicted.Jared Leto as the son Harry Goldfarb does a first rate acting job.  Frankly, prior to this role, I didn't think he had any acting talent. There is a growing problem with his injection infected arm which will remain visually with you long after the movie is over. Jennifer Connelly as Marion Silver is every bit as wonderful as Burstyn in this film. She is Harry's girlfriend, soon to enter a life of degradation due to the nightmarish descent into drugs.Because this film is so visual, it is an ideal one for seeing in the best possible format available.

530814,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B00003CXP1,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 1]","Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) loves to watch her TV, and she loves her son Harold (Jared Leto). The trouble is, Harry's a junkie; whenever he's jonesing for junk he and his partner Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) take Sara's TV to Coney Island and pawn it. All the yentas (Louise Lasser, et al) on Sara's block know that Harry steals her TV, but Sara won't turn him in. Even the pawn broker, Mr. Rabinowitz (Mark Margolis), wonders why she lets him get away with it time after time.Once she gets her TV back she'll most likely be watching an infomercial by Tappy Tibbons (Chris McDonald). It seems like he's always on. Like a poor man's Tony Robbins he whips the crowd into a frenzy--and there are prizes. He claims his regimen will change your life. All you have to do is stay on it for 30 ""Days of Fury."" He sells motivational DVDs. Sara Goldfarb is happy just to watch it on TV, but then she gets a phone call that says they want her to be on the show.-----------------------Sara Goldfarb: Harold, I'm gonna be on Television.====================She gets carried away by the idea of being on TV. It is kind of ironic to have Ellen Burstyn playing this role, because she is a veteran actress from the Golden Age of Television. She's been on TV a lot. Burstyn has had 5 Oscar nominations and won the lead actress Oscar for Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. Sara Goldfarb, on the other hand, has never been on TV. Sara Goldfarb gets so taken by the very idea of being on television that she goes on a diet so she can fit into her red dress. An unscrupulous doctor prescribes pills that get her hooked, just like her son, Harry--but with the extreme side effect of psychosis and paranoia.-----------------------Sara Goldfarb: And you should see my Harry on Television. We're giving the prizes away. I JUST WANTED TO BE ON THE SHOW.====================Requiem for a Dream is mainly about Sara and Harry Goldfarb, Harry's friend Tyrone C. Love, and Harry's girlfriend, Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly). Gold, Silver, and Love. At first they all have gleaming bright dreams, but everything goes dark.This film is based upon a book by Hubert Selby Jr.. He also wrote Last Exit to Brooklyn, and that was made into a film years ago. Selby has had a hard life and his writing is very dark. Very, very dark. There are a couple of conversations with him in the bonus material on the DVD. Selby didn't use any apostrophes in Last Exit to Brooklyn. He would write ""dont"" instead of ""don't."" I thought that it was kind of an affectation, but nevertheless, his writing holds a dark power. However, no matter how dark it gets, there is always compassion for the characters. Though Harry has pawned his mom's TV so many times they've lost count, once he gets ahead, he buys her a new TV.-----------------------Sara Goldfarb: I love you, Harry.Harry Goldfarb: I love you too, Mom.====================But this is a Hubert Selby Jr. story, so you know the good times won't last for long.The Bottom Line is that Director Darren Aronofsky (Pi, The Fountain, The Wrestler) was true to the spirit of Hubert Selby Jr.'s book, and the performances by Burstyn, Leto, Connelly, and Wayans, as well as the other cast members, were excellent. Aronofsky shows the exhilaration, but isn't stingy showing the high price they will pay. For that reason the last half of the movie grows increasingly grim, and it may be disturbing. I recommend it with caution.Pi(1998) Written & Directed by Darren Aronofsky; Mark Margolis was Sol Robeson; Sean Gullette was Maximillian Cohen; Ben Shenkman was Lenny MeyerLast Exit to Brooklyn

Requiem for a Dream is, at its core, about the horror of drug addiction and the degradation of the using life.  Only the purist masochist would choose this life if he knew what it held in store for him.  The characters in this tale unwittingly go down the gradual but steady road to hell and complete derelection, a decline that becomes more steep and takes on greater speed until it hits its inevitable bottom.  Take the most intense moments of Leaving Las Vegas, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and Jacob's Ladder, and roll them all up into one to get an idea of the movie's climax.  Thank God this is the edited edition.  I can't imagine how much more sordid the director's cut is.Requiem is a modern-day object lesson for those who would glamorize drug addiction and its captives.  The subject matter is quite grim, and on its own, the story is not particularly original.  What gives Requiem its appeal to critical acclaim is the incredibly effective camera techniques that director Darren Aronofsky gives this work.  Truly, it is an elegant piece of work in the way that many have called Einstein's Theory of Relativity ""elegant""; once you see it written down, it's so obvious, so clear, so simple.  And so dead on the money.  In fact, Aronofsky's effective filming of the story to bring to life, for the viewer, what it feels like to be caught up in that drug-addicted hell, is so perfect and so right-on that it must have already been done, but I can't remember when or where.For students of film making, this movie is a definite must see.

This is a bleak and quite unpleasant film; still there is much to recommend it: good directing, camera work, special effects, editing and acting--particularly Burstyn in the role of Sara Goldfarb, whose addiction to television leads to something stronger.  Burstyn's slow metamorphosis of the meek Sarah into a blithering psychotic is just a masterpiece of acting.  Jennifer Connelly shows she's not on the silver screen just for her looks and handles a complicated role as the degenerating junkie girlfriend with real style and color.  Leto and Wayans turn in memorable performances too as best friends turned failed drug dealers looking for one more good score to put them back in business.

With this film, the director finally finds material suited to his style, creating a harrowing journey about drug addiction that makes ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and ""Panic in Needle Park"" look like Muppet movies.Ellen Burstyn is a TV junkie who gets hooked on speed while trying to lose weight. Her son and his gorgeous spoiled girlfriend are hooked on heroin, and spend most of the film trying to score more drugs. The entire film is watching these lives spiral out of control, with the final thirty minutes, where everyone hits rock bottom, being the most intense, hard to watch scenes ever put on film.Burstyn shows she still has it, and should have beat Julia Roberts' cleavage for the Oscar. Jared Leto makes you forget ""My So-Called Life,"" and every other role he has had where he is the dreamy eyed high schooler all the girls want to date. Marlon Wayans, as Leto's best friend, takes the kind of turn from comedy to drama that must have Jim Carrey pulling his hair out in jealousy.

So many (too many) books and films try (and ultimately fail) to give us a sense of our drug culture, but this film succeeds on every level. Its take on the insidious presence of drugs, of one sort of another, in all our lives, sounds a loud cautionary note. And Hubert Selby, the author, has always taken a very hard, penetrating look at the views around him. This time (perhaps because of the film desecretion of his fine book Last Exit to Brooklyn) perhaps his involvement played a significant part in keeping the film so on track.With stunning performances by the entire cast, especially Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto, this is a scarily accurate view of how drugs, of whatever kind, can creep in and overtake our lives.

530824,A23MZ5EULW2GHH,B00003CXP1,"C. Heinrich ""wsidechris""","[3, 13]","I would actually give this 3.5 stars, but I can't justify bumping it to the higher value of 4 stars.I really wanted to like this, but the thing I kept asking myself during this movie was ""was there a screenplay written for this thing??"".  But the movie was so hell-bent on frenetic editing that even if there was a screeplay, it didn't matter anymore!  I could forgive the filmmakers if they hadn't *tried* so dang hard.  (Watch ""Taxi Driver"" for an excellent example of being real, gritty, and powerful without having to beat you over the head with it.  This movie is an insult to any adult's intelligence.)But the biggest flaw in this film was the fact that the characters were badly underdeveloped.  This is a serious problem when your film is supposed to be a character study (wait, what WAS the purpose of this movie?).  This serious flaw becomes even more obvious when you don't have a brilliant cast to pick up the slack in the writing.  But, I'm being more forgiveable here because Mr. Aronofsky did score big-time in getting Ellen Burstyn to play the leading role.  She saves it from becoming a complete mess.  For 20 years now I have been saying that Ellen Burstyn is easily among the top 5 actresses of her generation.  That cannot be argued (with me, that is).  She doesn't have a huge list of film credits, but she's given some of the finest performances ever captured on film:  ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"", ""The King Of Marvin Gardens"", ""Resurrection"", ""The Exorcist"", ""The Last Picture Show"", ""Same Time, Next Year"", etc. etc.  She's brilliant, and she is remarkable here, and her strength as an actress is what holds it together.  But the rest of the cast cannot make heads or tails with this script, and it shows.Jared Leto, first of all, cops probably the worst New York accent I've ever heard on film.  It's so bad that I either have to laugh or cringe during the many moment he ""toughens"" up his accent (usually whenever he raises his voice).  But his dullness otherwise seems fitting for playing a drugged out slacker, but it's still a dreadful performance.  Jennifer Connelly may or may not be good; heck, I don't know, because I don't know a stinking thing about her character.  Ditto for Marlon Wayans (and what's up with that girlfriend?  she just disappears from the movie.  why bring her out in the first place?).To top things off, the movie barrels into a noisy 15 minute finale that is laughable and ludicrously WAY over the top.  It takes everything to a total extreme (this side of having everyone die), but to say what, exactly?  Shock therapy, amputation, prison, and degrading sex acts for money (and degrading is an understatement for what happens at the end, by the way).  If I felt the movie had taken me somewhere before the finale, then maybe it wouldn't be so ridiculous.  Even the one character that you kind of get to know--Ellen Burstyn's Sara Goldfarb--is pushed into a situation way WAY over the edge of credibility.  It's downright laughable.I say this is strictly for the kids because I can hear them saying ""whoa, this is [messed] up, man!"".  Some of us grown-ups, however, will just sit there rolling our eyes.  It is clear evidence of the influence of technology and MTV on popular moviemaking.  I do have to give the filmmakers some kudos for creativity, but they also made this film seem like too much of an experiment.One other good thing I can say about this is the music score by Kronos Quartet.  It's very chilling, and was a nice surprise since I had feared this movie would have a noisy techno or hip-hop score (which it does at times).  But their bass-heavy strings help keep the atmosphere of the film from going completely over the edge.",3,Where's the screenplay?!?

530826,AH5Z0XEQHQL0W,B00003CXP1,"Chris Bundoc ""filmmaniac""","[0, 1]","'Requiem For A Dream' is one of the many films that I have been wanting to see for a long time. It must be because of the wild controvercy surrounding the film.To tell you the truth, I have not seen Darren Aronofsky's other films, but, after seeing 'Requiem', I'll try to get a hold of his other movies (such as Pi). His directing style is very chaotic, but seems to flow very well with all of the Frightening things that are happening on screen. I have got to agree, with other viewers, that the last 20 minutes of the film is the most Shocking scenes you will see in a movie, for a while. The film starts out easy, giving us tame shots of what each character goes through to get their daily 'fix' or to make their 'wishes' come true, but as the film runs along, be ready.Also, speaking of Performances, the actors and the actresses are Excellent! In particular, Ellen Burstyn. She handles her role (Sara) very well. In one part of the film, she is talking with her son (Harry) and just explaining what it is that makes her 'smile'. That scene is very heartbreaking, where we notice that she just wants to be loved.The supporting cast (Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans &amp; Jennifer Connelly) are Outstanding. They capure their characters in a way that is very real. Each of them put their best performances forward, and it showed, GREATLY.Worth mentioning is the Effects of the film. It's a star all on it's own. Filled with strobe lights, handheld cameras, quick editing and split screens, these effects really highten the theme of the film of being in a high or hallucination.After watching 'Requiem For A Dream' I have noticed that even though it's Shocking and Scary, it's at times Beautiful. Each of the characters wanted to get something out of life and that is what they got, but they paid in a high price. Overall, the main message of the film, as we all know by now is DON'T DO DRUNGS.",4,An Intense &amp; Disturbing Ride,1038182400,"11 25, 2002",2002,1890,"[""'Requiem"", 'Dream', 'one', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'wanting', 'see', 'long', 'time', 'must', 'be', 'wild', 'controvercy', 'surrounding', 'film.To', 'tell', 'truth', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'other', 'films', 'seeing', ""'Requiem"", ""'ll"", 'try', 'get', 'hold', 'other', 'movies', 'such', 'Pi', 'directing', 'style', 'very', 'chaotic', 'flow', 'very', 'well', 'Frightening', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'screen', 'have', 'got', 'agree', 'other', 'viewers', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'most', 'Shocking', 'scenes', 'will', 'see', 'movie', 'while', 'film', 'out', 'easy', 'giving', 'tame', 'shots', 'what', 'character', 'get', 'daily', 'make', ""'wishes"", 'come', 'true', 'film', 'along', 'be', 'ready.Also', 'speaking', 'Performances', 'actors', 'actresses', 'are', 'Excellent', 'particular', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'role', 'Sara', 'very', 'well', 'one', 'part', 'film', 'talking', 'son', 'Harry', 'just', 'explaining', 'what', ""'smile"", 'scene', 'very', 'heartbreaking', 'where', 'notice', 'just', 'be', 'loved.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'amp', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'are', 'Outstanding', 'capure', 'characters', 'way', 'very', 'real', 'put', 'best', 'performances', 'forward', 'showed', 'GREATLY.Worth', 'mentioning', 'Effects', 'film', 'star', 'own', 'Filled', 'strobe', 'lights', 'handheld', 'cameras', 'quick', 'editing', 'split', 'screens', 'effects', 'really', 'highten', 'theme', 'film', 'being', 'high', 'hallucination.After', 'watching', ""'Requiem"", 'A', 'Dream', 'have', 'noticed', 'even', 'Shocking', 'Scary', 'times', 'Beautiful', 'characters', 'wanted', 'get', 'something', 'life', 'what', 'got', 'paid', 'high', 'price', 'Overall', 'main', 'message', 'film', 'know', 'now', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'DO', 'DRUNGS']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut
530827,AAOMG1YP0VNP9,B00003CXP1,Chris 'raging bill' Burton,"[1, 4]","When a film has a repuation like that of Requiem For A Dream, its fair to say that there will be plenty of naysayers in the crowd. And while I'm not one of them, I can't say I'm in a rush to join the hardcore fans either. Ultimately, I'd say that RFAD succeeds in what it is trying to do. Set around Harry Goldfarb, his mother Sarah, girlfriend Marion and best friend Tyrone, the film is a exciting yet simplistic look at drug addiction.There's really no denying the power of this film. Though many will say that the arty directing techniques have been done before and the characters are poorly developed (both fair criticisms, mind) this film completely blew me away the first time I saw it. Its intense, fast moving and ultimately depressing. So why am I refering to it as entertainment? Because really, that's all it is. Visually its incredibly impressive but the storyline and the themes in the film are weak and simplistic. The whole 'don't do drugs' thing makes this film come across as a piece of government propaganda at times. You'll end up in jail! You'll poison yourself! You'll become a prostitute! You'll go mad! All in all its far too politically correct for its own good and so busy shoving its own agenda down your throat that you're left with no room to breathe. I'm not looking for a film that attempts to justify heroin use or deny its dangers but I don't need to be reminded of its dangers 24/7.RFAD will impress and depress you with its powerful imagery and fast moving pace (not to mention Ellen Burstyn's stunning performance as a lonely widow) but after two or three viewings (by which time the shock value will have fallen) it comes across as little more than entertaiment for the mentally masochistic. If you want a film about drugs, Trainspotting is the one you want. If you want a film that plays with your emotions, then Irreversible is superior to this. Requiem For A Dream is in some respects a must-see, but it doesn't make you think nor does it present any ideas or themes that you've never seen before. It still gets 4 stars because if I said I didn't like it or that I wasn't very impressed when I first saw it, I'd be lying. But then I'd also be lying if I said it was anywhere near as good as the likes of Fight Club, Mulholland Drive or Memento.",4,"A great film, though hardly genius",1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,2283,"['When', 'film', 'repuation', 'Requiem', 'A', 'Dream', 'fair', 'say', 'will', 'be', 'plenty', 'naysayers', 'crowd', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'m"", 'rush', 'join', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'Ultimately', ""'d"", 'say', 'RFAD', 'what', 'trying', 'do', 'Set', 'around', 'Harry', 'Goldfarb', 'mother', 'Sarah', 'girlfriend', 'Marion', 'best', 'friend', 'Tyrone', 'film', 'exciting', 'yet', 'simplistic', 'look', 'drug', 'really', 'denying', 'power', 'film', 'many', 'will', 'say', 'arty', 'directing', 'techniques', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'characters', 'are', 'poorly', 'developed', 'fair', 'criticisms', 'mind', 'film', 'completely', 'blew', 'away', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'intense', 'fast', 'moving', 'ultimately', 'depressing', 'So', 'why', 'am', 'refering', 'entertainment', 'really', 'Visually', 'incredibly', 'impressive', 'storyline', 'themes', 'film', 'are', 'weak', 'simplistic', 'whole', ""n't"", 'do', 'drugs', 'thing', 'film', 'come', 'piece', 'government', 'propaganda', 'times', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'jail', ""'ll"", 'poison', ""'ll"", 'become', 'prostitute', ""'ll"", 'go', 'mad', 'far', 'too', 'politically', 'correct', 'own', 'good', 'so', 'busy', 'shoving', 'own', 'agenda', 'throat', ""'re"", 'left', 'room', 'breathe', ""'m"", 'not', 'looking', 'film', 'justify', 'heroin', 'use', 'deny', 'dangers', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'reminded', 'dangers', '24/7.RFAD', 'will', 'impress', 'depress', 'powerful', 'imagery', 'fast', 'moving', 'pace', 'not', 'mention', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'stunning', 'performance', 'lonely', 'widow', 'two', 'three', 'viewings', 'time', 'shock', 'value', 'will', 'have', 'fallen', 'across', 'little', 'more', 'entertaiment', 'mentally', 'masochistic', 'want', 'film', 'drugs', 'Trainspotting', 'one', 'want', 'want', 'film', 'emotions', 'then', 'Irreversible', 'superior', 'Requiem', 'A', 'Dream', 'respects', 'must-see', ""n't"", 'make', 'think', 'present', 'ideas', 'themes', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'still', '4', 'stars', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'impressed', 'when', 'first', 'saw', ""'d"", 'be', 'lying', 'then', ""'d"", 'also', 'be', 'lying', 'said', 'was', 'anywhere', 'as', 'good', 'likes', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'Memento']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

It is especially difficult when many of the reviews give away important plot details, which I avoid since I believe in letting the viewer make up his or her own mind._RfaD_  tells of four people, who will all be conquered by addiction, living in the Brighton Beach section of New York City.  There's Harry Goldfarb (played by Jared Leto), a rather unmotivated man in his late twenties who somehow gets by without a job or any prospects of finding one.  The opening scene involves Harry pawning his mother's television set.  There's Harry's friend Tyrone(played in a surprisingly fine dramatic performance by Marlon Wayans), who like Harry dreams of obtaining financial security without having to work hard for it.  There's Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), an aspiring artist who comes from a well-to-do but emotionally remote family.  And finally there's Harry's mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn delivering one of the most courageous performances ever captured on camera), a lonely and slightly obese widow who pines for the days when her husband was still alive.  _RfaD_ chronicles the addictions of these four people throughout three seasons: Summer, Fall, and Winter.What all four of these people have in common is that they all have dreams, none of which come true because of the addictions of these people.  Harry wants to make himself and everyone happy around him. He believes that by selling and using drugs, he can achieve that goal.  Tyrone seeks the happiness he knew as a child with his loving mother, and a lot of money on the side.  Marion is trying to find the love she feels she is not receiving from her own family.  And Sara believes she can ""be somebody"" by appearing on a self-help infomercial.  She tries to lose weight so she can once again wear a red dress that was symbolic of better times.  If there is a point to all this besides the obvious ""just say no to drugs"" message , it's that you can't live your dreams by living in Dreamland.As many reviewers stated previously, this is not easy viewing - nor is it meant to be.  When I rented this from my local Movie Gallery, I had to go back and rent Caddyshack to pick myself back up.  Anyhow, there are entirely too many out there who say this film delves into only worst case scenarios.  Hello!!!  Drug addiction, be it illegal or legal drugs, in itself is a worst case scenario.  Life is not a made-for-TV movie in which every one who is addicted kicks the habit before things get too far out of control.  If _RfaD_ had one fault, it was that it UNDERSTATED the dangers of addiction.  Yes, you read that correctly.  There are horrors from addiction worse than what we see in this film as hard as that is to believe.

During the entire film, i was fastened to my seat, my mind and body enraptured in it all. Ellen Burstyn deserves to snatch that Oscar away from Julia; her performance is one of the few rare ones that I've seen by a lead actor that is so hauntingly real and exhibits beauty and realism that few actors possess, especially nowadays. The refrigerator scene is marvelous, and brought me to tears. She is a beautiful woman, and very brave; not many actresses would throw themselves into a movie that requires them to look about 50 pounds heavier and 25 years older. I never thought Marlon Wayans would move me as he does in this movie. The story about his mother is heartbreaking. Both Ellen and Jared were willing to transform their bodies (Jared lost quite a lot of weight), and were not afraid to fall apart piece by piece, so realistically, so devoted to look for a way out that would destract them from what is lacking in their lives. Jennifer Collenny is also outstanding.  She is a delicate beauty, surely not the 'ideal' picture of a junkie, yet she goes through an agonzing process to feed her habit, and like the rest of the actors; puts every blood cell and heartbeat into her role. The scene where she screams while in the bathtub made me jump out of my seat. It was also intresting to notice two actors from 'Happiness' having roles in this film. It's sad to notice the lack of recognition that this film has received, but critics and Hollywood usually miss the mark anyway.

Don't get me wrong, I liked Requiem (well, parts of it) but there's enough to recommend a viewing but I always wonder whether people say these movies are masterpieces simply because it tackles a hard subject matter. I mean, have you ever heard of someone outright bashing a war movie? And so we have Requiem for a Dream, Darren Aronofsky's follow-up to the rightly praised Pi; a no-holds barred and unflinching look at drug use and the deterioration of them.The film follows 4 characters: Harry, his girlfriend Marion, Harry's friend Tyrone and Harry's mother Sara. The former 3 are drug users who pawn TV's to get money while Sara; hearing of the news she'll be on TV, takes diet pills to fit into her old dress. Pretty soon all 4 of them find themselves given a good mind **** about what it is to be addicted to something and the realization you ran out.The film uses many different filmmaking techniques to lend different images to its story. We have the snorricam (a camera attached to the actor, commonly seen in those night-vision haunted house TV shows), a camera shaking violently complete with warped sound, split screen, quick editing, dissolves and shots with fast-motion mixed with slow motion. This makes the film certainly visually packed with stuff but there's barely any substance. In other words, we don't care about these characters when we should; aside from Ellen Burstyn's character, everyone is just simply plot puppets as I call them. They're not fleshed out characters but the amount of visuals being used and the subject suggests we should care but we don't; we just see these drug addicts turn into something with no care about how they'll end up, we just watch them do it.Not to say there's nothing to recommend here because there is. Burstyn, as Aronofsky says in his commentary, is so all over the place within the same scene that it's sad she lost to that wench from Erin Brockovich. Hell, Juliette Binoche in Chocolat was better than her. And it's surprising to see Marlon Wayans doing a dramatic role and being good although he does at times do stuff that seems ""Marlon-esque"". Jennifer Connelly is of course good while Christopher McDonald plays a great send-off of those bad motivational speakers you see on TV.While I am recommending the film, I hate the kind of self-knowing importance the film has. It's one thing to have an unrated ""director's cut"" the same thing since the film ignored the MPAA and just released the film unrated anyway but to have the Play button listed with ""watch the inspirational film!"" seems kind of egotistical to me.

It shows how low humanity can sink in the search for happiness, and how people can fool themselves into thinking that their actions bring them joy while in reality they are on a self-destructive path. An incredible cast and everyone of them gave a solid performance, especially Ellen Burstyn.The film's strong point is how it satirizes modern day society's obsession with material values, the need for speed, immediate gratification and always seeking the quickest way for success rather than working hard for it. People may think that we live easier lives now than we did before, but despite our technological advancements and pharmaceutical aids, the lowest common denominator will always keep us down and prevent us from achieving happiness. Mankind's stupidity is on display in this film, in all its infamy and unholy glory.The scariest part of this film is that it speaks a great deal of truth about our species in the most honest, uncharacteristically clear and untainted point of view. Perhaps in a sense the pace of this film makes an indirect comment on how we rush through our lives without realizing how incredibly easy it really is to find, reach, grasp and hold onto happiness, but without anyone to tell or show us what it is, we blindly go on seeking that which we cannot find for the life of us. In this case it's the most extreme circumstances, but sadly it's not that uncommon, and it gives the audience a chance to maybe recognize some of their own flaws, strictly on the principle of the ideas presented.The manner in which the various characters transgress rapidly on the slippery slope of poor choices was superbly portrayed and directed.  It really doesn't take much for people to go from relative normalcy to complete and utter chaos and debasement, so this film serves as a warning to maintain a modicum of moderation throughout our lives, in all aspects of it.'Requiem For A Dream' was not very palatable for the public at large, hence it is not a very well known film but for any fan of movies as an art form should watch this movie for the skill contributed by the director's unique approach, not to mention the wonderful performances by Jared Leto, Jennifer Connely, Marlon Wayans and the magnificent Ellen Burstyn who gives the performance of her life.

This movie uses imagery, color, and editing in ways that mix and combine their various powers and lash out, leaving you almost senseless after watching it.It takes place in Coney Island, NY, and follows the relative descent of four characters, seperately and together.  On one side, you have Jared Leto, his best friend, Marlon Wayans, and girlfriend, Jennifer Connelly, all trying to structure their futures while shooting up heroin.  Then you have Leto's mother, in an courageous and flawless performance by Ellen Burstyn, who thinks she is going to win a junk-mail contest and be on television.  That ignites a flame in her to lose weight as quickly as possible, and in doing so she becomes addicted to physician-described diet pills.There is a nice, slow buildup through the film, showing a combination of complete utopia of the drugs, and the destructive results as well.  The interaction of an amazing script, direction, acting, scoring and editing holds up every seen, and your eyes are locked, horrified but not able to turn away.  Slowly, things break down and all hope is lost in this psychotic assault overload.Darren Aronofsky follows up 'Pi' in a way I wish I could describe with doing justice.  To think that this film is only his second shocks to me as to what his future might hold.  He creates moments of rapture which he easily discards for pieces of vague, hallucinogetic, nightmarish visions.  Every scene is carved to near perfection, and they are stacked in such a way that you couldn't walk out if you wanted to.Beware of this film and it's bravery, and make sure you keep away from the sure-to-pop-up Rated-R cut.

Leto playing Harry Goldfarb and Wayans playing Tyrone Love are low level drug dealers hoping to make that one big score.  Connelly is Leto's middle class girlfriend who has aspirations of becoming a fashion designer.  They find their dreams however slowly dissolving as their heroin habits increase and their existence becomes seamier and seamier.The unquestioned star of the film was Ellen Burstyn stupendously effectively portraying widowed housewife Sara Goldfarb.  Burstyn spends her days enthralled with an inspirational game show.  She receives a phone call informing her that she's been selected to appear as a contestant.  As a result she convinces herself to lose weight to improve her appearance.  Unable to diet she resorts to visiting a diet doctor.  Amazingly Burstyn gets hooked on diet pills and undergoes an astounding transformation with the help of a talented make up artist.  Her fantasy of appearing on TV gets replaced by drug induced hallucinations culminating in institutionalization.This is not a pretty movie but is very effective in elaborating how drugs destroy the hopes and dreams of the main characters.

It was the one, near the end, where Ellen Burstyn's character receives shock treatments.  Her amazing performance, along with the brutal, unwavering camera angle and direction, combined to produce the most electrifying, riveting sequence I can recall ever seeing in a movie, the effect seeming to put the viewer inside the character in that instant.  It was as if at that point the movie reached out and grabbed the viewer, dragging them down onto that table, as if the frantic, primal screams of the observed were pulled from the observer.  I marveled at the fecund cynicism by which this was concocted.  I found myself laughing heartily, my guffaws born of admiration for the sheer outrageousness of it.  It's the truth, I will not lie; but to those who may find this a callous or inappropriate response to the scene, I should remind them that this is acting, on a make-believe set, which is how I saw it, and my appreciation was for the filmmaking technique itself, and the manner in which it was executed.  All is illusion on the screen.  It's not real.  She wasn't really having megavolts of electricity run barbarically through her brain by an apparatus more at home in the Dark Ages (though still in use).  But the acting!  Stupendous!  Magnificent!  For me this was the climax of the movie, the catharsis, the axis upon which the entire production turned, and well worth the price of admission.  Bravo, Ellen Burstyn, et al!As previously indicated, Requiem for a Dream made an impression---so much so that I went to some length to find out the name of it, having forgotten.  I'm going to avoid all the phony moralizing about drugs that seems to attend some reviews of this movie, on this and other sites.  In life, stuff happens.

The direction here is brilliant and breathtaking...brutal and stunning and just infectious all at the same time.  The film, an adaptation of Hubert Selbeys novel of the same name, Requiem for a Dream follows the lives of four people, interlocked by blood, friendship and addiction.  Sara Goldfarb (Burstyn in an oscar caliber performance) has resorted to couch-potato status as she wastes her life away in front of the television with massive amounts of diet pills and coffee to make it through the day, her favorite gameshow always on to take her mind off her addiction.  Her son, lowlife Harry (Leto) has resorted to pawning his mothers things just to support his heroin habit, a habit he shares with best friend Tyrone (Waynes in a performance I never knew he had in him) and girlfriend Marion (Connelly).  The film helps to show the massive effect that addiction has on a person, one of the best scenes involving Sara imagining a carniverous fridge, and it also shows the self deterioration a person undergoes when giving themselves over to feeding their addiction.  With their whole world spinning out of control the four addicts, the four losers as it were, fall to pieces and theres nothing there to put them together.  One of the most heartbreaking scenes involves Marion giving herself away sort-of-speak in order to feed her habit.  You can feel her inner morality sink and her pride get pushed aside all for a high she can't find anywhere else.

The lessen here is so unsparing and so unglamorous, one wonders whether it should be part of every high school curriculum.  Using every cinematic trick in the book, Aronofsky once again laces his images with the cinematic enthusiasm of an eager film school graduate anxious to show the world everything he has learned. But unlike in his other film PI, where his enthusiasm often crosses over into gratuitous overuse of cinematic gimmicks, his tricks here are much more suitable to the material.It's the tale of Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), a Brighton Beach youth who, along with his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), is hopelessly addicted to drugs. Harry's widow mother on the other hand (Ellen Burstyn who is bound to be nominated for an Oscar for her performance) is addicted to food and TV, and to pathetic daydreams of appearing on TV in front of adoring masses. As the seasons pass from summer to fall, their lives quickly and irrevocably degrade.Dispensing with nearly all character development, Aronofsky and co-screenwriter Hubert Selby Jr. dive directly into the despicable addictions of the four main characters, visually and aurally bombarding the audience with an ever-increasing milieu of unpleasantness. And though the narrative starts off a bit slowly, once the pace picks up it never slows down, ultimately speeding to a stunning orgy of cross-cutting between the four downward spirals of the main characters, finally grinding to a halt when they hit rock bottom.Uncompromising from beginning to end, it's not the most entertaining film in theaters today, but it certainly teaches a sobering lesson.",4,Fatal Drug Attraction,985737600,"03 28, 2001",2001,1919,"['Just', 'FATAL', 'ATTRACTION', 'required', 'viewing', 'person', 'who', 'ever', 'contemplated', 'quot', 'innocent', 'quot', 'fling', 'infidelity', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'latest', 'assault', 'senses', 'required', 'viewing', 'person', 'who', 'ever', 'considered', 'experimenting', 'drugs', 'lessen', 'here', 'so', 'unsparing', 'so', 'unglamorous', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'part', 'high', 'school', 'curriculum', 'Using', 'cinematic', 'trick', 'book', 'Aronofsky', 'once', 'again', 'images', 'cinematic', 'enthusiasm', 'eager', 'film', 'school', 'graduate', 'anxious', 'show', 'world', 'everything', 'learned', 'other', 'film', 'PI', 'where', 'enthusiasm', 'often', 'over', 'gratuitous', 'overuse', 'cinematic', 'gimmicks', 'tricks', 'here', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'suitable', 'material.It', 'tale', 'Harry', 'Goldfarb', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Brighton', 'Beach', 'youth', 'who', 'girlfriend', 'Marion', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'friend', 'Tyrone', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'hopelessly', 'addicted', 'drugs', 'Harry', 'widow', 'mother', 'other', 'hand', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'who', 'bound', 'be', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'addicted', 'food', 'TV', 'pathetic', 'daydreams', 'appearing', 'TV', 'front', 'adoring', 'masses', 'seasons', 'pass', 'summer', 'fall', 'lives', 'quickly', 'irrevocably', 'degrade.Dispensing', 'nearly', 'character', 'development', 'Aronofsky', 'co-screenwriter', 'Hubert', 'Selby', 'Jr.', 'dive', 'directly', 'despicable', 'addictions', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'visually', 'aurally', 'bombarding', 'audience', 'ever-increasing', 'milieu', 'unpleasantness', 'narrative', 'starts', 'bit', 'slowly', 'once', 'pace', 'never', 'down', 'ultimately', 'speeding', 'stunning', 'orgy', 'cross-cutting', 'four', 'downward', 'spirals', 'main', 'characters', 'finally', 'grinding', 'halt', 'when', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom.Uncompromising', 'beginning', 'end', 'not', 'most', 'entertaining', 'film', 'theaters', 'today', 'certainly', 'sobering', 'lesson']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

Ellen Burstyn gives maybe the best motion picture performance I've ever seen. Not HER best ever...THE BEST EVER. I have never seen an actor or actress lay themselves bare like this before. Watching the sweet, lonely Sara Goldfarb become a speed freak is bad enough, but the paths followed by her son Harry (Jared Leto), his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans, a true revelation..), and Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly)are equally harrowing; By the end of the film I felt like I had been sent through the wringer.....The DVD has some of the most clever packaging I've seen in quite some time: It's presented like an infomercial for Sara's favorite TV personality, Tappy Tibbins, played by Christopher MacDonald.

530855,A1R60K9D56XYL,B00003CXP1,Danny Rizzi,"[0, 0]","And hands down the best film of 2001. Many GREAT films, and ""Requiem....."" is without a doubt one, are tragedies and viewing them a second time is for some of us not an option. I do agree with the one editorial that this is grim stuff and not easy to sit through. But well worth it all the same.Aronofsky, after the success of ""Pi"", a film I found much more impressive than enjoyable, actually has a cast to work with this time. The acting in ""Pi"" was sub-par, one of the things I didn't like about the film. However, ""Requiem....."" has Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, & Shawn Wayans giving what will surely be the very best performances of their respective careers. Burstyn I've never seen better and her losing the Oscar to Julia Roberts underscores once again how much of a popularity contest those awards are.Bustyn plays Sara Goldfarb, an aging widow starved for companionship and feeling cut-off from her only child, Jared Leto. Her loneliness finds her addicted to television. She fills out an application to be a guest on an infomercial-ish type show and then waits for the call. A call she will never get. In the meantime, in order to look her best on the tube she begins dieting. One scary aspect of the film is how easy it is for her to obtain what is basically speed from her apathetic physician. Before you know it, poor Sara Goldfarb is a total speed freak. At the same time, her son & his girlfriend along with the sons best friend, descend into harrowing addictions to heroin. In this superb film all of the characters are three-dimensional....they live & breathe. The film also makes the obvious but no less impactful statement that drug addiction cuts across all boundaries of the economic stratum. You will not soon forget some of the images of the characters going through withdrawal. Aronofsky is relentless during this part of the film and I think the editorial that describes the film as ""a relentless sensory assault"" cannot be any more perfect a description.  There are two harrowing scenes with Jennifer Connelly's character showing where her addiction has taken her.  I think it's important to mention that there is some comic relief in the form of Goldfarbs neighborhood friends.(it was especially nice to see Louise Lasser again) And Thank God for the humor or else I don't know if I could take it. If Aronofsky's ""Pi"" had some of the off-hand humor of ""Requiem...."" it may have been more successful.So if your tastes lean more toward challenging, thought-provoking outside-the-mainstream fare, and you aren't especially squeamish ""Requiem....."" is a viewing experience you won't soon forget. Like I said, this is powerful stuff and I wouldn't suggest viewing it alone. I did and found it hard to shake the disturbing images and depressing outcome for all of the characters. As a matter of fact, as I write this I can still see Burstyn's Goldfarb going through her withdrawals. Creepy. Lastly, if you decide you want to view this film do yourself a favor and be sure to rent the directors cut.

It also touched on the fact that everyone is addicted to something, that nobody lacks a jones for something, be it heroin, alcohol, television, friendship or simple hope. The movie isn't cliche thanks to a stunning ensemble of performances and Darren Aronofsky's direction.On the surface, it sounds like every &quot;my drug hell&quot; movie ever made, insofar as Harry Goldfarb, his girl Marion, and his buddy Tyrone are concerned.  What makes it work is that the script (by Selby and Aronofsky) introduces us to the characters, lets us get to know them, actually get to like them.  As their lives decline, you're THERE.  You see it, you feel it all.But the plotline of Harry's mother, Sara, is in a class by itself.  Done by Ellen Burstyn, it's a truly astounding piece of work.  Sara starts on a downward spiral when she's given a simple piece of hope.  It's truly horrible to watch.All of this is helped along by a truly stunning score by Clint Mansell, who scored Aronofsky's first film (also an excellent work) &quot;Pi.&quot;  Mansell, with the help of the Kronos Quartet, proves he's going to be a powerful force in film scoring.Don't be turned off by the NC-17 rating, or think this is inappropriate for teenagers because of it, this, along with &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, is the best filmed argument not to use drugs ever made.

No, correction: let's take a stroll down the big broad generous boardwalk of Coney Island, down past the Carousel of Dying Dreams, pausing a moment to stare at the Ferris Wheel of Decay and Death and Dissolution.No. Don't stare. Darron Aronofsky's sophomore effort, ""Requiem for a Dream"", is a subversive instrument. It should be regulated by the secret police. It is a vicious sucker punch to the unprepared, unsuspecting kidney masquerading as an anti-drug flick. Be warned, this godawful thing has teeth. You will cry. You will blanch. Your face, virtuous, untainted by human sin (relatively, in our Relative World), will get all white and taut. You will get sick at your stomach. You might puke.OK, there; disclaimers out of the way. Ma Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn, amazing, truly, descended from Heaven with a fiery sword of Truth, I sh*t thee not) is a pudgy, rugose widow who dreams of getting on the game show she watches with cultic fervor. She lives in Brooklyn. She's aging, bored, flabby, tired. She is Hungry.Her son Harry Goldfarb (the incomparable Jared Leto): living on the fringe in Brooklyn, hooking up with his needle-romancing friends on the fringes of a decaying Coney Island. Harry wants to be rich. He wants to fly. He wants to do the funky chicken dance only unrestricted ""H"" can bring about. He dreams of the big score. He wants to buy Ma Goldfarb a huge-a**ed Tee-Vee, where she can watch Gameshows Valhalla-style. He is Hungry.Oh, but there's more: Dreams are like that. Like wars, they have dictionaries of casualties. There is an infinite supply of fresh, warm-blooded young meat for the grinder. Shall we continue? We shall. There's Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans, redeeming himself), who imagines himself to be a better man---for his own life, for his progeny---than he is. He wants a quick, fast, fat, profitable score. Who can blame him? Who wants to eat catfood in retirement? Hungry.But now, we can't forget Marion Silver (the astonishingly gorgeous Jennifer Connelly). Can we? We cannot. She is gorgeous. Her skin pulses with life. She is a rebel. She doesn't care. Ah, but she does. Youth cares, yes it does, for maybe it doesn't know of old age, but it can feel the thing's stinking corpse-breath. So yeah, Marion will deal---but she'd prefer not to. Which is why she goes along with Harry Goldfarb's ""score"". Hungry? Yup.Half of the horror is watching a field of roses go up in a napalm strike: in that spirit, I won't spoil anything for you. Well, other than to say this: Love, as some sage once observed, is the most furiously dangerous trap of all. Darren Aronofsky has set horror to celluloid: the horror of a billion lives of quiet, and noisy, desperation.

Before watching this movie be warned that it is ultimately very depressing with shocking graphic imagery.The story revolves around young New Yorker Harry and the most important people in his life - his Mother, girlfriend and best friend. Whilst Harry, his girlfriend and best friend are addicted to drugs as a choice of escaping from their lives, his Mother is addicted through medication prescribed by 'health professionals' and because of this, it is the saddest story of all.

If you watch it a second time, you'll know the happenings much better; therefore, you'll understand it better.  The director has a unique style of expression which is seen most with how he expresses the characters' drug use.  He probably did this to show us the gruesome realities of their behavior.  It worked.  This is one of the most daring films released in a long time.  It graphicly explores what many others wouldn't dare: drug use, weight issues, prostitution, etc.  Ellen Burstyn performs in the Oscar nominated role of her career as an ethedryl and television addict.  Jennifer Connelly was dissed for many major awards for her role as a prostitute, as was the movie in whole.  Marlon Wayons marvelously shows his serious side of acting rather than his usual comedy.  Jared Leto portrays a drug addict and trafficker in the best acting role of his career.  &quot;Requiem For a Dream&quot; may not be for those who are sensitive to such graphic material.

When the film started, I didn't no where it was going.  Once it established it's rhythm, detailing the high highs and low lows of chemical dependency this film takes hold of you and doesn't let go.  Credit for this has to go to director Darren Aronofsky who establishes himself as a new and creative force in film-making.  It seems like this film was made a long time ago and I eagerly await viewing his next project(that said, I wasn't too partial to ""PI"").  The ensemble acting in this film is superb.  Jennifer Connelly is a stand-out as a heroine addict who ultimately succumbs to the worse kind of degradation to support her habit.  The ultimate praise, however, is reserved for Ellen Burstyn.  She not only gives a great performance but an acting performance for the ages.  Her character breaks your heart from start to finish.  The movie begins with her enabling her heroine addict son by allowing him to steal her beloved TV and ends with her being subjected to drug-treatment for becoming adicted to amphetamines because she wanted to look good for the all-important TV.

Harry (Jared Leto) and Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are a couple buddies who hustle drugs and get high together; they even manage to set money aside and feel like they are making successes of themselves in their own way.  They discover how precarious their position really is when the supply of drugs in their area dries up and they are forced to go on the road to find more.  Marion (Jennifer Connolly) is Harry's beautiful girlfriend, who squanders money from her wealthy family while she feeds her addiction and dreams of opening a boutique with Harry's help.  Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is Harry's nave mother, whose belief that she will appear on an infomercial leads her into an addiction to diet pills in an effort to lose weight.Each of these characters is sustained by a dream that enables them to use drugs, believing that it is a temporary stage on their way to a brighter future.  By the end of the film, all of their dreams have been cruelly but unavoidably crushed and the characters themselves have spiraled into their separate lonely hells.  It's not easy to watch because the talented cast invests their characters with much compassion.Don't see this film if you are one of those people who believes that all movies should make us feel good.

530865,A36L1F0YECOAW8,B00003CXP1,David Grant,"[14, 18]","Darren Aronofsky's follow-up to his acclaimed indie debut 'Pi' is an expertly made nightmare, chronically the lives of four characters, woven together through addiction and tragedy. It does not sugar-coat it's subject matter. It is brutally frank in it's depiction of drug use and the ultimate physical, mental, and emotional deterioration that comes from losing control of one's own life to drugs. Ellen Burstyn plays Sara Goldfarb, a lonely woman whose husband has passed away and whose son, Harry (Jared Leto), only comes to visit when he needs to take her television set down to the pawn shop for drug money. She is addicted to television and sugar, eating chocolates while watching her game shows, day in and day out. She receives a junk phone call one day, a call that misleads her into thinking that she is going to be a contestent on one of these shows. She is ecstatic. She will wear her red dress, the one she wore to her son's high school graduation. The problem is, she no longer fits into it. So she tries a diet, but her need for sweets is too great and chooses diet pills instead. Harry spends his days with Tyrone (a straight and wonderful Marlon Wayans) who is the man with the connections, and his nights with Marion (Jennifer Connelly), his girlfriend. Each of these three characters is already addicted to drugs, not one in particular, rather anything to keep them feeling right. Harry and Tyrone devise a scheme by which they will become dealers, insuring the constant income of money and the possible score of something really, really good. Aronofsky's technique is brilliant, using every cinematic trick in the book to fully realize the effects of the drugs they're shooting, snorting, smoking, or swallowing. Over and under-saturated colors, quick jump cuts, overexaggerated sounds, slow motion, fast motion, steady cam, split screen... everything blazes by in a strange hallucinatory way when the characters are using. Everything seems skewed but yet right. When they come down, the film's look seems to slow down with them and the illusion fades. The world becomes dank again, becomes dull and hefty, the weight of normal life is felt. The film is not a happy story, the characters go from bad to very, very bad to beyond rescue by it's finale. Each character ends up where they should and not because we want them to. Each character is a tragedy, they are glimpses of lost dreams, abandoned hopes, failed promises, and needless depressions. By the film's end we feel sorry for them, not because they were addicted to drugs and suffered the consequences of them. But rather we for the fact that they even shot up in the first place. What a waste of life. 'Requiem For A Dream' is a masterpiece of cinematic direction and is a tough, unflinching film. It should be watched by parents with their teenage children. It's probably the best deterrent to drug use that exists right now. A cautionary tale that is both heartfelt and heart breaking.

530876,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CXP1,D. Litton,"[0, 0]","The phrase &quot;nerve wracking&quot; earns new meaning with Darren Aronofsky's &quot;Requiem For A Dream,&quot; a complex film that deals with the physical, mental, and emotional consequences of drug use on variously striking levels. Aronofsky handles the material in a heavy manner, throwing all the style, all the sensory imagery, all the bone-chilling sequences he can muster up into the film, giving it such a rush that when the final frame rolls by, it was all I could do heave a sigh of relief. Or was it bewilderment?Undoubtedly, this is one of the best movies to come along in years, relying on a strong, gripping plot to achieve a high note of urgency and importance. It moves at various speeds, from that of a narcotic-induced high, to that of a delusional nightmare, but it never loses its momentum or its tightening grip on its audience.It chronicles the lives of four people, average citizens hoping to make something more out of their dreary lives. Harry Goldfarb wants nothing more than to live a life of happiness and luxury with his girlfriend, Marion. Together with his friend Tyrone, he sells narcotics, reaching a point where he feels nothing can overcome his newfound wealth. The three of them live and interact together in a frenzied, drug-induced euphoria that casts a veil over their lives, one that is as inviting as it is foreboding.Harry's mother, Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), is so overcome by her loneliness that she practically goes off the deep end when she receives a call from a game show inviting her to appear on television. She grabs her favorite red dress from the closet, dyes her hair bright red, and goes on dietary drugs to fit into her dress.Thus begins Aronofsky's setup for a final act that becomes more than just a conclusion for the characters, but an awakening for audiences everywhere. When their supplier becomes cut off, Harry and Tyrone become frantic, as does Marion, who is enveloped by her addiction to the point where she is willing to sacrifice her dignity for smack. But it is Sara's downfall that becomes the centrifuge for the film's message: in the beginning, we see her without the drugs, as opposed to the remaining three characters. The movie allows us to follow her in her descent, as she begins to obsess about her weight, popping more pills than she can count until she imagines her refrigerator moving on its own.If you think a moving fridge is nothing to get excited over, you'll reconsider. Aronofsky sets up such scenes with deluded visions and wraparound shots of his actors, casting them as well as us into a whirlwind of mass hysteria that carries us into the very heart of the movie's many dilemmas. He brings to the first two-thirds of the film repetitive cuts of drugs, bloodshot eyes, narcotics and various other paraphernalia, which act as a metaphor for the quick thrills as a result of the use of drugs. As a result, the final act's impact is made that much more engrossing, and a sudden sense of intensity and subtly chilling suspense washes over the entire film, stemming from our wanting to know what will come of the characters as a result of their choices.The cast for &quot;Requiem&quot; also enhances the movie's overall appeal. Leto, Connelly, and Wayans each turn in the performance of their careers, separately portraying different aspects of the effects of drugs. It is Ellen Burstyn, however, who steals the show in a forthright, unrelenting performance that is the highlight of the Best Actress category for 2000. She pulls out all the stops, portraying Sara's fall from grace with a terror that is made all-the-more chilling because of its universal truths.&quot;Requiem For A Dream&quot; isn't just a movie: it's a message, one that screams itself into the hearts and minds of any who happen upon it. Aronofsky helms the project with a superiority unmatched by most other films of its kind, evoking a tense, mind-bending journey that is a must for fans of character-driven dramas and those considering the use of illegal substances. By choosing to focus on the personal results of the characters, the movie takes on a whole new meaning, rising out of the depths of its own depravity to become one of the best and most memorable pictures of 2000, as well as all time.",5,One of the most powerful films in recent memory.,1003017600,"10 14, 2001",2001,4264,"['phrase', 'quot', 'wracking', 'quot', 'new', 'meaning', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'quot', 'Requiem', 'A', 'Dream', 'quot', 'complex', 'film', 'deals', 'physical', 'mental', 'emotional', 'consequences', 'drug', 'use', 'variously', 'striking', 'levels', 'Aronofsky', 'material', 'heavy', 'manner', 'throwing', 'style', 'sensory', 'imagery', 'bone-chilling', 'sequences', 'can', 'muster', 'up', 'film', 'giving', 'such', 'rush', 'when', 'final', 'frame', 'rolls', 'was', 'could', 'do', 'heave', 'sigh', 'relief', 'was', 'bewilderment', 'Undoubtedly', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'come', 'along', 'years', 'relying', 'strong', 'gripping', 'plot', 'achieve', 'high', 'note', 'urgency', 'importance', 'various', 'speeds', 'narcotic-induced', 'high', 'delusional', 'nightmare', 'never', 'momentum', 'tightening', 'grip', 'audience.It', 'lives', 'four', 'people', 'average', 'citizens', 'hoping', 'make', 'something', 'more', 'dreary', 'lives', 'Harry', 'Goldfarb', 'nothing', 'more', 'live', 'life', 'happiness', 'luxury', 'girlfriend', 'Marion', 'Together', 'friend', 'Tyrone', 'narcotics', 'reaching', 'point', 'where', 'nothing', 'can', 'overcome', 'newfound', 'wealth', 'three', 'live', 'interact', 'together', 'frenzied', 'drug-induced', 'euphoria', 'veil', 'lives', 'one', 'as', 'inviting', 'foreboding.Harry', 'mother', 'Sara', 'Goldfarb', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'so', 'overcome', 'loneliness', 'practically', 'deep', 'end', 'when', 'call', 'game', 'show', 'inviting', 'appear', 'television', 'grabs', 'favorite', 'red', 'dress', 'closet', 'hair', 'bright', 'red', 'dietary', 'drugs', 'fit', 'dress.Thus', 'Aronofsky', 'setup', 'final', 'act', 'more', 'just', 'conclusion', 'characters', 'awakening', 'audiences', 'everywhere', 'When', 'supplier', 'cut', 'off', 'Harry', 'Tyrone', 'become', 'frantic', 'Marion', 'who', 'enveloped', 'addiction', 'point', 'where', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'dignity', 'smack', 'Sara', 'downfall', 'centrifuge', 'film', 'message', 'beginning', 'see', 'drugs', 'opposed', 'remaining', 'three', 'characters', 'movie', 'follow', 'descent', 'obsess', 'weight', 'popping', 'more', 'pills', 'can', 'count', 'refrigerator', 'moving', 'own.If', 'think', 'moving', 'fridge', 'nothing', 'get', 'excited', 'over', ""'ll"", 'reconsider', 'Aronofsky', 'up', 'such', 'scenes', 'deluded', 'visions', 'wraparound', 'shots', 'actors', 'casting', 'as', 'well', 'whirlwind', 'mass', 'hysteria', 'very', 'heart', 'movie', 'many', 'dilemmas', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'film', 'repetitive', 'cuts', 'drugs', 'bloodshot', 'eyes', 'narcotics', 'various', 'other', 'paraphernalia', 'act', 'metaphor', 'quick', 'thrills', 'result', 'use', 'drugs', 'result', 'final', 'act', 'impact', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'engrossing', 'sudden', 'sense', 'intensity', 'subtly', 'chilling', 'suspense', 'washes', 'entire', 'film', 'stemming', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'come', 'characters', 'result', 'choices.The', 'cast', 'quot', 'Requiem', 'quot', 'also', 'movie', 'overall', 'appeal', 'Leto', 'Connelly', 'turn', 'performance', 'careers', 'separately', 'portraying', 'different', 'aspects', 'effects', 'drugs', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'however', 'who', 'show', 'forthright', 'unrelenting', 'performance', 'highlight', 'Best', 'Actress', 'category', '2000', 'out', 'stops', 'portraying', 'Sara', 'fall', 'grace', 'terror', 'made', 'all-the-more', 'chilling', 'universal', 'truths.', 'quot', 'Requiem', 'A', 'Dream', 'quot', ""n't"", 'just', 'movie', 'message', 'one', 'hearts', 'minds', 'who', 'happen', 'Aronofsky', 'helms', 'project', 'superiority', 'unmatched', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'kind', 'evoking', 'tense', 'mind-bending', 'journey', 'must', 'fans', 'character-driven', 'dramas', 'considering', 'use', 'illegal', 'substances', 'choosing', 'focus', 'personal', 'results', 'characters', 'movie', 'whole', 'new', 'meaning', 'rising', 'depths', 'own', 'depravity', 'become', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'memorable', 'pictures', '2000', 'as', 'well', 'time']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[14, 40]","First of all, I simply wish to say that Ellen Burstyn's performance in this movie was probably the best piece of acting these old eyes have ever seen.  Playing lonely widow Sara Goldfarb, an insecure woman with a loser for a son, Burstyn delivers this role so powerfully and emotionally--particularly as the character succumbs to diet pill addiction--that the viewer is overwhelmed with sadness and compassion.Unfortunately, Sara Goldfarb is the only character worth caring about, as REQUIEM FOR A DREAM tells a parallel story about three heroin addicts.  Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and his best bud Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are hedonistic junkies that only live for their next fix.  Harry is Sara's son, thus the bridge between the two stories.  We're given little or no explanation as to why these three people are strung out on drugs, and when the movie begins, when Harry and Tyrone steal Sara's TV (again) to pawn it for drug money, I said to myself, ""I really don't care what happens to these characters.""Whatever admirable qualities these three people possess are rapidly dissolved in the face of spiraling addiction.  When each one of them ""hits bottom,"" I was unmoved.  Also annoying was Harry ruining his left arm by continuing to shoot heroin into it.  Did it ever occur to him to use his other arm, or other veins of his body?  And what could have been a very interesting side story--Tyrone's fond memories of the closeness he shared with his mother--was never developed.REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is as powerful as the pills and smack being consumed, yet director Darren Aronofsky's movie falls short when only one of the four primary characters is salvageable.

Gorgeously filmed, beautiful visuals...wholly depressing...crystal clear filmmaking. Excellent performances by the cast. The story almost seems inconsequential somehow (even though it's not)...mostly, I felt like I was was watching a moving painting.Ellen Burstyn's performance as the mother, a lonely widow whose hope of being on TV (so that her loser son and deceased husband would be proud of her) leads to an addiction to diet pills and a severe case of dementia, was one of the finest moments of acting I believe I've ever seen.The film style itself employs a variety of different camera angles, split screens, and some truly beautiful juxtapositions. The scenes become darker, more jagged and frantic, as the movie progresses and the four main characters spiral steadily downward.The music and the sound in this film is also extremely powerful. The popping of pill bottles, the quitly mocking laughter of the empty mailbox...those are the two sounds that really stick out for me. Then the music, the haunting background theme that plays nearly constantly over much of the film, will stick in your mind and haunt you long after the movie has ended.I believe everyone I know that has seen this movie has loved it, and I have to say that despite its disturbing content, I really loved it too. That said, this is definitely one of those films that people will either love or hate...it's really not a middle-ground type of movie. It's truly an example of movies as an art form. As you can see from my first impressions of it there, first viewings of it seem to lend themselves more to the art of the filmmaking itself rather than the actual content of the movie...it was so clear cut that I don't think there's a lot left to 'understand', but at the same time, repeated viewings will likely be necessary just to let it sink in.I resisted watching it for a very long time because no one could tell me why they loved it so much and I had it in my head that it was going to be 'just another of those stupid drug movies'.

In a nutshell: onrushing catastrophes at every level.This is one of those films, in the tradition of ""Breaking the Waves,"" where during the first 10 minutes you see very clearly that the main characters---quite sympathetic, unfortunately---are going to be on a fast-accelerating downhill slide for the rest of the movie.  Unlike similar films that chronicle a steady process of chemical-related self-destruction (""Trainspotting"" and ""Leaving Las Vegas"" come to mind), ""Requiem for a Dream"" will never be accused of ""glamorizing"" or ""romanticizing"" substance abuse.  Director Aranofsky seems to take special pains to capture every excruciating torture and suffering that his protagonists undergo---in fact, he even uses film and sound techniques to amplify it and shove our noses into it.Unfortunately, while the film is fairly bold as art, and probably quite accurate as social documentary, as an aesthetic work it simply is not very enjoyable to watch.  Both ""Trainspotting"" and ""Leaving Las Vegas"" had similarly bleak and hopeless storylines, yet managed to tell those stories in creative and interesting ways, rather than just straight-up, visually-enhanced journalistic docudrama...i.e. both were far more enjoyable because they were much more multi-dimensional, their characters were far better developed and far less predictable.  Leto, Connelly, Wayans, and Burstyn are all talented actors and appealing characters but they are barely developed beyond the black holes of their addictions and compulsions; instead they are presented as basically 4 hopeless and helpless lambs about to be tortured and eaten alive before our eyes in myriad ways.About the only truly original and insightful character drama is that played by Ellen Burstyn, in that we are all too rarely shown the more mainstream addictions that is sadly predominant in American society: food, television, and prescription (diet, in this case) meds.  She was the most interesting of the bunch by far, the other 3 leads are all cardboard characters we've seen a million times before, albeit played by very competent actors.This film could've been far more original, interesting, and insightful if it had simply focused on Burnstyn's character as a case study for mainstream America---lobotomized by TV, living isolated miserable lives in a dysfunctional community and culture, bloated by junk food used as pleasure substitutes, getting their fixes from the local pharmacy.Three stars for visual/aural stimulation but shallow and cliched storyline.",3,Like watching a train wreck...,1100044800,"11 10, 2004",2004,2794,"['only', 'slow-motion', 'lots', 'MTV-ish', 'intercutting', 'speeded-up', 'sequences', 'pulsating', 'soundtrack', 'carnage', 'unfolds', 'blood', 'lens.Only', 'here', 'carnage', 'not', 'only', 'physical', 'more', 'unbearably', 'psychological', 'emotional', 'spiritual', 'sexual', 'nutshell', 'onrushing', 'catastrophes', 'level.This', 'one', 'films', 'tradition', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'where', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'see', 'very', 'clearly', 'main', 'characters', '-quite', 'sympathetic', 'unfortunately', '-are', 'going', 'be', 'fast-accelerating', 'downhill', 'slide', 'rest', 'movie', 'similar', 'films', 'chronicle', 'steady', 'process', 'chemical-related', 'self-destruction', 'Trainspotting', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'come', 'mind', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'accused', 'glamorizing', 'romanticizing', 'substance', 'abuse', 'Director', 'Aranofsky', 'take', 'special', 'pains', 'capture', 'excruciating', 'torture', 'suffering', 'protagonists', 'undergo', '-in', 'fact', 'even', 'film', 'sound', 'techniques', 'amplify', 'shove', 'noses', 'it.Unfortunately', 'film', 'fairly', 'bold', 'art', 'probably', 'quite', 'accurate', 'social', 'documentary', 'aesthetic', 'work', 'simply', 'not', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'Trainspotting', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'had', 'similarly', 'bleak', 'hopeless', 'storylines', 'yet', 'managed', 'tell', 'stories', 'creative', 'interesting', 'ways', 'rather', 'just', 'straight-up', 'visually-enhanced', 'journalistic', 'docudrama', 'i.e', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'multi-dimensional', 'characters', 'were', 'far', 'better', 'developed', 'far', 'less', 'predictable', 'Leto', 'Connelly', 'Wayans', 'Burstyn', 'are', 'talented', 'actors', 'appealing', 'characters', 'are', 'barely', 'developed', 'black', 'holes', 'addictions', 'compulsions', 'instead', 'are', 'presented', 'basically', '4', 'hopeless', 'helpless', 'lambs', 'be', 'tortured', 'eaten', 'alive', 'eyes', 'myriad', 'only', 'truly', 'original', 'insightful', 'character', 'drama', 'played', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'are', 'too', 'rarely', 'shown', 'more', 'mainstream', 'addictions', 'sadly', 'predominant', 'American', 'society', 'food', 'television', 'prescription', 'diet', 'case', 'meds', 'was', 'most', 'interesting', 'bunch', 'far', 'other', '3', 'leads', 'are', 'cardboard', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'million', 'times', 'before', 'played', 'very', 'competent', 'actors.This', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'far', 'more', 'original', 'interesting', 'insightful', 'had', 'simply', 'focused', 'Burnstyn', 'character', 'case', 'study', 'mainstream', 'America', '-lobotomized', 'TV', 'living', 'isolated', 'miserable', 'lives', 'dysfunctional', 'community', 'culture', 'bloated', 'junk', 'food', 'used', 'pleasure', 'substitutes', 'getting', 'fixes', 'local', 'pharmacy.Three', 'stars', 'visual/aural', 'stimulation', 'shallow', 'cliched', 'storyline']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

Unlike that quite good first feature, Requiem is quite a dissapointment.

Starring such notables as ""that guy from In Living Color, and that guy from My So Called Life,"" Requiem is perhaps the most freakishly exaggerated account of drug abuse since the infamous public service film ""Reefer Madness."" At one point a senior citizen imagines her refrigerator trying to eat her and later recieves electric shock treatment to cure her obvious insanity, all because of an addiction to doctor prescribed diet pills. Last I knew, diet pills were not hallucinogenics. Aronofsky's like that weird guy who keeps telling you the story of his friend who took too much acid and is in a hospital thinking he's a glass of orange juice and can't move or else he'll spill, even though you know it's not true. Perhaps the only difference is that Aronofsky takes two hours to tell the story.

Her son, Harry, in an attempt to go somewhere with his and his girlfiend's life, gets the not-so-brilliant idea of becoming a drug-dealer, and his friend Tyrone also helps out in this scheme.Harry's girlfriend, Marion, is an addict and when Harry can't provide drugs for her, she turns to prostitution.  Harry and Tyrone both end up in nightmarish ends, but Marion's end is far worse.The music is amazing and the cinematography is stunning as the movie grabs you and brutally forces you into this nightmarish plunge.Caution though, if you are planning to watch the director's cut, watch out for the graphic group and lesbian sex scene.  It caught me off guard, but the scene is necessary to grasp just how far Marion had fallen and just how horrible it is what she is doing to herself.This is a very disturbing and depressing movie, but it is also very powerful and will change the way you view addicts and prostitutes.

I just can't do it myself...For those who honestly loved the movie, I can understand.  I just can't see so many people honestly enjoying something so disturbing.I usually love movies where you are left feeling uneasy, left almost feeling afraid of the world.  That uncomforable feeling at the end of a movie is what, in my opinion, makes some films so great.  See Happiness.  See In The Company of Men.  See a lot of other films.  Just don't see this one.The problem with this movie wasn't the actors.  The performances that were given were truely special.  On that level, I did like the movie.  I most especially enjoyed Ellen Burstyn, who does an amazing job with her character.  She gives a character without much to say some incredible depth, and you are left feeling her pain.  The direction of the film was very slick.  The drug scenes were at the very least interesting.  I've never shot up, and after watching this film, I can promise you I never will.My problem with the film is that you aren't just left feeling uncomfortable at the end of the film.  You are dragged through it by your hair - over hot coals, and shards of glass.  It gives you that truely uncomfortable feeling throughout, and by the end you are truely happy that it is over, and left wondering why you didn't turn it off earlier.  You feel, throughout the movie, as if you were doing the drugs with the characters.

Marion could be the gorgeous girlfriend any mother would be thrilled to have her son bring home for dinner. Sara doesn't feel needed by anyone anymore. She's got her seating position among the women of her building who like to take in the sun in the afternoon, and she's got her television programs to which she is addicted. Her one goal is to appear on television in her red dress to make her friends and her family proud. Her son, Harry, just wants to make some money so he can live the life to which he has yet to become accustomed but knows he wants. If he and Tyrone can score that one big buy of drugs and sell them, they can be rich and live easy lives. Marion depends on the kindness of men to ease her way through life. In Harry she believes she's found her source of love, livelihood, and drugs. All four of these people want what everyone wants - to be loved, to be needed, and to be successful. Only for these four it all goes horribly wrong because, in their need, they accept addiction as part of the dream.This movie is difficult to watch, but not because it isn't well done. I can't think of a movie that's done better than this one. It's just so horribly painful to watch people who have all the best intentions sink deeper and deeper into self-destruction. Louise Lasser plays Sara Goldfarb's best friend. She is the embodiment of the fact that people only see what they want to see, even when a friend, a close friend like Sara, become hopelessly troubled and essentially become someone else completely.Requiem For A Dream is about drug addiction, but it is also about people leading quiet lives of desperation and the lengths to which they will go to try to grab the gold ring and realize their dreams. All of the actors in this movie are superb, and Ellen Burstyn should have won an Academy Award for the work she did in this movie. She is nothing less than outstanding. But credit should also be given to the way in which the movie was filmed. When Sara becomes paranoid, the camera helps you to feel the paranoid feelings she's experiencing. When Tyrone runs away from a shooting, the camera makes you feel his fear and his pounding heart as he flees. When Marion shows up at the door of a man who will give her drugs in return for whatever favors he requires, your skin crawls along with hers as she does whatever it takes to get her fix.

530908,A3SOKVFUWBC31N,B00003CXP1,garlandb,"[9, 11]","Why was 'Requiem for a Dream' the best movie of last year ?  The cast is definitely one of the reasons.  Marlon Wayans, while not a tear jerking dramatic performance he showcases a side not often scene in films like 'Scary Movie' which he is better known for.  Jennifer Connelly and Jared Leto have incredible chemistry as the central couple who create several unforgettable moments.  Sean Guilette (star of Aronofsky's 'Pi') creates an incredibly evil character in only a few minutes on the screen.  Last but surely not least Ellen Burstyn's role as Sarah Goldfarb.  If ANY ROLE has ever deserved an Oscar that is it.  The scene when she's telling her son about her lonely life and she's in between smiles and tears is one of the most powerful moments I've ever seen on screen.  The second ingredient is the script written by Aronofsky and literary great Hubert Selby JR.  Narratively the film never stumbles or comes close to letting the viewer down.  The third thing that makes this film rise so high above the endless sea of cinema is Aronofsky's unforgettable visual style.  His patented &quot;hip-hop montages&quot; give the film a fast, edgy contemporary feel.  Also anyone who could breath new life into split screen is a god in my books.

530909,A367Q9VRWQZG7W,B00003CXP1,Gavin B.,"[1, 1]","I read all of the member reviews for ""Requiem"" and there is little to add in way of praise for this astonishing film. It is ashamed that this ""Requiem"" got lost in the shuffle of drug films, last year. It is a far better film than the cooly detached ""Traffic"" or the inane ""Blow"". This should be the last film made on the subject of drug addiction...there is really nothing more to say. Aronofsky has made a film that captures the paradoxical pleasure/pain principle of addiction. The axiom of ""Requiem"" is this: All of us stand dangerously near the threshold of self-consumption. The monkey is waiting to jump on your back everywhere you go: the doctor's office, the liquor store, behind the Wall Mart, the playground, or the beach. As we watch friends and family spiral out of control, we realize that this could be OUR family, OUR friends; all of us.The entire cast of the film was daring, and took chances with tainting their images by portraying such nakedly vunerable characters. These were roles that many actors would take a pass on, because of the emotional toll that a film like this demands on the human psyche. It is reavealing that Hollywood chose Julia Roberts, their own ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"", over outsider Ellen Burstyn for Best Actress. Ms. Burstyn is a fearless and consumate actress and she will be remembered for this role...and twenty years from now ""Requiem"" will be remembered as THE drug film.",5,Weighing In On Requiem,1012867200,"02 5, 2002",2002,1425,"['read', 'member', 'Requiem', 'little', 'add', 'way', 'praise', 'astonishing', 'film', 'ashamed', 'Requiem', 'got', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'drug', 'films', 'last', 'year', 'far', 'better', 'film', 'cooly', 'detached', 'Traffic', 'inane', 'Blow', 'should', 'be', 'last', 'film', 'made', 'subject', 'drug', 'addiction', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'say', 'Aronofsky', 'made', 'film', 'paradoxical', 'pleasure/pain', 'principle', 'addiction', 'axiom', 'Requiem', 'stand', 'dangerously', 'threshold', 'self-consumption', 'monkey', 'waiting', 'jump', 'back', 'everywhere', 'go', 'doctor', 'office', 'liquor', 'store', 'Wall', 'Mart', 'playground', 'beach', 'watch', 'friends', 'family', 'spiral', 'control', 'realize', 'could', 'be', 'OUR', 'family', 'OUR', 'us.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'film', 'was', 'daring', 'took', 'chances', 'tainting', 'images', 'portraying', 'such', 'nakedly', 'vunerable', 'characters', 'were', 'roles', 'many', 'actors', 'would', 'take', 'pass', 'emotional', 'toll', 'film', 'human', 'psyche', 'reavealing', 'Hollywood', 'chose', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'own', 'Rebecca', 'Sunnybrook', 'Farm', 'outsider', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Ms.', 'Burstyn', 'fearless', 'consumate', 'actress', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'role', 'twenty', 'years', 'now', 'Requiem', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'THE', 'drug', 'film']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut
530910,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B00003CXP1,General Zombie,"[4, 14]","Well folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. (""Crash"" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would ""change the world"".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film:  I don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn't depressing at all cause I didn't care.  It's just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination.All right, here's a plot summary:  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and this really messes up their lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is.  The fundamental flaw is this: I don't like any of these people, so their pain doesn't mean anything, and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect.  Maybe if Aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would've worked, but now there just isn't anything there.  As far as what's actually in the movie, we've got  Jared Leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a fashion designer, or something.  Beyond this we've got Jared's mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is a weird old woman and Marlon Wayans as Leto's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues.  I particularly love how there's no real attempt to make Wayans into a person.  He's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that's it.  The doubly sad fact is that he's the most likable of the three.  He at least displays a little life.  Connelly and Leto apparently just wandered here from a Bergman film and are so dull and slow that it's a wonder that the smack doesn't cause them to cease to exist entirely.  (Well, Connelly actually does coke, I think, but it fails to liven her up any.  Also, I actually *like* the Bergman films I've seen, so that's not really a fair comparison.)  They love each other, apparently, but since I don't even like either of them I'm not much interested.  Finally, Burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been funny if I cared about her, but we've been over that...And I want you people to know that I'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies.  I can care about the characters, but none of these people did anything for me, so the movie's dead in the water.  For good counter examples watch ""Trainspotting"", which has drug-addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and ""Bubba Ho-Tep"", a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it.  On the other hand, neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as ""Requiem For A Dream"", so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego.  Still, if that's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose.""Requiem For A Dream"" isn't helped any by Darren Aronofsky's repetitive, derivative over-direction.  The trouble is, this movie hasn't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is.  There's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics, but they're hopelessly driven in to the ground, as we see fast-motion a thousand times, quick-cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk, and they are, again, impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain't drawing me in.  I imagine that the overdone, repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch.  The score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over.Truth be told, I thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half, but then it really started to grate on me.  It became evident that no, Aronofsky wasn't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no, these characters weren't going to get any more interesting.  I looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film, and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective.  It was kind of uplifting, really:  Now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom I can go do something else.  Now that's a good ending.Grade: D+PS This is 500 reviews.

Maybe that's one reason why it usually works - it never falls victimn to Political Correctness or outrage - it cruises along almost like a documentary. The four addicts played by Ellen Burstyn (diet pills), Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto, and Marlon Wayans (heroin) are like failures from the show ""Intervention."" Leto, who would wreck his career with ""Alexander"" a couple years later, is quite good and Connelly, who nearly stole ""A Beautiful Mind"" from Russell Crowe is hauntingly effective and real. Ms. Burstyn is a marvel: her sad,lonely Brighton Beach widow left with nothing but a dream of game-show stardom is an amazing performance. Her Oscar nomination was richly deserved - she has received Oscar nods in 4 different decades - a feat that only Bette Davis and Meryl Streep have also achieved. But ""Requiem"" is a jarring and often ugly film that dectracts from its allure.

Of all the recent drug-themed movies (""Blow,"" ""Traffic,"" ""Jesus' Son""), this is probably the most powerful. It is also the most adventurous cinematically, as well as being the most effectively cautionary of all these cautionary tales.Several viewers below noted how stunned they were by the cinematography, the editing and the top-notch acting. I certainly had expected a well-acted film--the cast alone would suggest that. Ellen Burstyn's has garnered a good deal of well-deserved acclaim. And I knew that Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans were up and coming young actors--who basically needed a plum role or two to really jump start their careers. Well, they certainly got a chance to strut their collective stuff in this release, and I hope they're able to capitalize on the film's artistic success.But I have to admit, I was unprepared for the film's powerful contemporary feel. The old fashioned 50s style title (evocative of such films as ""Hatful of Rain"" and the ""The Man With the Golden Arm"") had me fooled. The startling camera work, the jump editing, the stark soundtrack (courtesy of the Kronos Quartet) were anything but old fashioned. In lesser hands, it might have risked cliche --but director Darren Aronofsky and screenwriter Hubert Selby Jr. have all avoided the trap of sheer avant-garderie by emphasizing the human element over mere style.

Amongst them are David Fincher, Steven Soderbergh, Oliver Stone, Michael Bay, P.T. Anderson, and now Darren Aronofsky.  The film is superbly directed in every aspect, and, the actors don't miss a step either.I've read dozens of reviews on the film, and it exceeded my expectations.  I thought ""Traffic"" was bad, well, this makes ""Traffic"" seem like an episode of Full House.  When I say ""Traffic"" is bad, I don't mean a bad movie, I mean bad like showing what it's really like.  I loved ""Traffic"", and it opened up my eyes to a lot, but ""Requiem For a Dream"" scared me beyond being scared.  Although the film isn't primarily a drug film, it's still got quite a bit to do with drugs.  Not a drug film means it doesn't neccessarily mean it's specifically about DRUGS(like heroin, or speed).  Darren Aronofsky stated that it shows how anything can be a drug, T.V. dope, hope, or even love.  Stealing a page from EW, I must say that this film DOES INDEED need to be shown in every high school to EVERY student(I'm a froshman, soon to be Sophmore), and EVERY film school class in the world.  Half the time I didn't know whether to be scared from what just happened, or in awe of the cinematography.  Pretty much both.  The film deserves multiple viewings, just to take in the different aspects.Jared Leto superbly portrays Harry.  I liked seeing him in a bigger role, since my only REAL exposure to him is ""American Psycho""(Hilarious), and ""Fight Club"".  Ellen Burstyn's performance can't be explained with words, that's how frightening she becomes.  Marlon Wayans proves he CAN act outside of a comedic-environment, and I respect him much more because of it.  Jennifer Connely doesn't slack any either.This DVD is a must for everyone.  The menus even got me excited, and there's tons of supplementals.  Among them: Making of(35 min. long), Anatomy of a Scene(6 min.), Deleted Scenes,and commentary tracks.I can't say enough that this movie was worse than I expected.  It was great, but really scared me.  When I read about the scene where Ellen Burstyn has hallucinations of her refrigerator attacking her, I laughed... It's no laughing matter.  If your a high school teacher, and your reading this : SHOW THIS TO YOUR STUDENTS!!  I DONT CARE WHAT YOU TEACH!  Everyone else, just watch it at least twice; once for the story, the second for the magnificent directing.  Kudos to Aronofsky.",5,Restored my faith in Film...

530921,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B00003CXP1,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[0, 4]","This film reminds me of Gaspar Noe's Irreversible, in that it's initially an assault on the senses, and you feel as if you've seen great filmmaking because of it.  When I revisisted Irreversible recently, I found out I'd been had.  Noe's film is just an assault on the senses with nothing in its core.  Aronofsky's film, while nowhere as overly graphic, sadistic or disgusting as Irreversible, has this same quality.As many have said here, the main message here is a very simplistic one, DRUGS ARE BAD.  It's almost on the level of an after school special, and that's a shame, as Aronofsky has a very good visual and editing style, but after nearly 2 hours of it, it's overkill.  I felt totally numbed after seeing this film.  I sat in my car afterwards, and I couldn't move.  But aside from the pure visceral experience of the film (which feels like a drug, the drugs the movie is telling us not to use), there isn't much left there.  There's some depth in Ellen Burstyn's character (she gives a great performance), but I believe that has to do with the fact this is based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s book.  If there is any humanism in this film, it's derived from the novel, not Aronofsky, who is like a kid with his new toy.  The characters of Leto and Connelly are especially bad, especially Connelly.  She is supposed to be a junkie, but she looks way too beautiful to be one.  Overall, the film is worth watching at least once, but it's essentially a visceral assault on your senses and little else.A funny sidenote...Before this film screened (I saw it in a theater), the theater was playing The Wallflowers's album Breach, which is one of my favorite albums of theirs.  After I recovered from this assault, I kept thinking about how wonderful and tuneful those songs were, and I pretty much forgot about Aronofsky's film (until I wrote this review).  I bought Breach, and it's one of my favorite albums.

While it is by far the most disturbing film of 2000, this movie is thought provoking, intelligent, true-to-life and utterly convincing. I can promise you right now this is a movie you&#65533;re not going to forget in a while and a movie that is unlike any other drug movie ever put to the silver screen. Requiem for a Dream is so graphic with its violence, adult themes, drug taking and sex it may become a little too much for some people. I was frankly almost sick. So if you&#65533;re a faint-hearted person I recommend skipping this movie and maybe seeing the equally good The Basketball Diaries. Okay, back to the film. It is one of the best movies of 2000 and has a unique power. As soon as this movie was over I just wanted to go back and see it again. It&#65533;s official &#65533; this is the first movie in history than really properly portrays how heroin and speed and every other drug can dislocate us from ourselves. This movie has been classified as drama but it is really a horror film. It is so realistic, true-to-life and graphic about drugs and how they effect our lives that I was utterly terrified. I will never ever take drugs after seeing Requiem for a Dream and if I ever feel the need to I&#65533;ll watch the movie and forget all about it. The performances in this movie are absolutely breathtaking. Marlon Wayans is a star and Jennifer Connelly is shocking and great as a girl who will do anything to get something to smoke. Jared Leto is unequally fantastic and by far the best young actor in this gripping movie. However, it is not a surprise that Ellen Burstyn gives the best performance. She is truly terrifying, believable and masterful as Sarah, who is using a dangerous diet and just wants to be on television. This movie has many memorable and terrifying scenes but I will not ruin it for you.

Most of the camera tricks, although a bit MTV-ish as the director himself alludes to, are really interesting and are in fact grounded within the confines of the storyline. The ritual of ingestion gets very repetitive, but that's the point.A few things did bother me.. Some of the execution of the story and the camera-work seemed a bit cute... in a way, &quot;Pi&quot; seems to be more developed as far as distinctive atmosphere then RFAD. This is a minor complaint though, because as I said, the plot does keep one's attention. And all traces of cuteness are forgotten as the inescapable consequences of the characters' actions take on more and more gravity. The pacing is very well done. The downward slope goes from slight to sharp very quickly, leading to a frenzied jump-edit climax where everything forms a tornado of despair, and the viewer is left thinking, &quot;Something like this would never happen&quot;, but it would, and it does.As far as emotional resonance with the characters, the most harrowing to watch would more than likely be Sara Goldbaum (as seems to be the almost unanimous opinion). The younger characters at least have some idea of what they're getting themselves into, but Sara starts out so innocent with her foray into pills (with the mindset that the doctor gave them to her..what could the harm be?). She then ends up addicted, with her mind deteriorating until she's only a shell...housing a jumbled mess of disconnected scattered thoughts and perceptions. The others don't end up in positions any better, for the record, and human fallability and frailty has seldom been better documented.The power this film has is that it causes one to mull over their own decisions and consider whether they've been wise... Life can be beautiful, but it's all too easy to destroy it, no matter how invincible we think we are.Hopefully we'll all see this before it's too late.",5,"Yeah, yeah...another review to add to the heap...",1027296000,"07 22, 2002",2002,2442,"['many', 'others', 'was', 'amazed', 'Aronofsky', 'debut', 'quot', 'Pi', 'quot', 'had', 'heard', 'much', 'highly-revered', 'film', 'finally', 'checking', 'know', 'story', 'now', 'starting', 'characters', 'dabbling', 'substances', 'good', 'naive', 'intentions', 'starting', 'lose', 'control', 'finally', 'being', 'pulled', 'down', 'spiral', 'losing', 'much', 'more', 'initially', 'thought', 'ever', 'would.Going', 'being', 'jaded', 'film', 'obsessive', ""'d"", 'like', 'consider', 'movie', 'actually', 'did', 'grab', 'hold', 'attention', 'start', 'Most', 'camera', 'tricks', 'bit', 'MTV-ish', 'director', 'are', 'really', 'interesting', 'are', 'fact', 'grounded', 'confines', 'storyline', 'ritual', 'ingestion', 'very', 'repetitive', 'point.A', 'few', 'things', 'did', 'bother', 'me..', 'execution', 'story', 'camera-work', 'seemed', 'bit', 'cute', 'way', 'quot', 'Pi', 'quot', 'be', 'more', 'developed', 'as', 'far', 'distinctive', 'atmosphere', 'then', 'RFAD', 'minor', 'complaint', 'said', 'plot', 'keep', 'one', 'attention', 'traces', 'cuteness', 'are', 'forgotten', 'inescapable', 'consequences', 'characters', 'actions', 'take', 'more', 'more', 'gravity', 'pacing', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'downward', 'slope', 'slight', 'sharp', 'very', 'quickly', 'leading', 'frenzied', 'jump-edit', 'climax', 'where', 'everything', 'tornado', 'despair', 'viewer', 'left', 'thinking', 'quot', 'Something', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'quot', 'would', 'does.As', 'far', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'characters', 'most', 'harrowing', 'watch', 'would', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'Sara', 'Goldbaum', 'be', 'almost', 'unanimous', 'opinion', 'younger', 'characters', 'least', 'have', 'idea', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'Sara', 'out', 'so', 'innocent', 'foray', 'pills', 'mindset', 'doctor', 'gave', 'her..what', 'could', 'harm', 'be', 'then', 'up', 'addicted', 'mind', 'deteriorating', 'only', 'shell', 'housing', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'disconnected', 'scattered', 'thoughts', 'perceptions', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'positions', 'better', 'record', 'human', 'fallability', 'frailty', 'seldom', 'been', 'better', 'documented.The', 'power', 'film', 'one', 'mull', 'over', 'own', 'decisions', 'consider', ""'ve"", 'been', 'wise', 'Life', 'can', 'be', 'beautiful', 'too', 'easy', 'destroy', 'matter', 'how', 'invincible', 'think', 'are.Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'see', 'too', 'late']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

530938,A1HZ82QCA8Z92P,B00003CXP1,Hubert Vigilla,"[32, 36]","Adapted from the novel by Hubert Selby Jr. (who co-wrote the screenplay), Darren Aronofsky's &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is a descent into utter despair, a journey through the unfulfilled dreams of four characters whose lives are driven by drugs. It is a haunting, heartbreaking look at the dark side of addictions and is my personal pick for the best film of 2000. The story centers around Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), and his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn), all of whose lives are driven by addictions: Harry and Tyrone are junkies, Marion is a coke addict, and Sara, persuaded to loose weight for a possible TV appearance, is hooked on diet pills. The film begins by showing each of these characters' dreams nearing fulfillment. Just when it seems that happiness is attainable, all of the characters' lives spiral out of control until they hit rock bottom. All of the performances are stellar, particularly Wayans and Burstyn. Wayans took me completely by suprise showing that he can actually act and act well. Yet it is Burstyn who stands miles above the rest. Her portrayal of the lonely, pathetic yet well-meaning Sara is incredible. It was Sara whom I felt most sorry for of this entire tragic quartet. Burstyn deserves an award for this role (and that is fact, not opinion). Aronofsky's direction makes this film a visceral, kinetic experience. His use of split-screens, fast cuts, and the infamous snorri-cam give this film an intense, addictive feel. The film's 20-minute-montage-from-hell finale is a blistering, disturbing combination of Aronofsky's quick paced flash coupled with the impeccably agonizing performances by the cast. All of this is punctuated by the Clint Mansell score performed by The Kronos Quartet, music which is fittingly somber and dirge-like. &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is powerful cinema that can truly be called a work of art, a haunting nightmare that can rightfully be called beautiful.",5,A Beautiful Nightmare,980985600,"02 1, 2001",2001,2000,"['Adapted', 'novel', 'Hubert', 'Selby', 'Jr.', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'quot', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'quot', 'descent', 'utter', 'despair', 'journey', 'unfulfilled', 'dreams', 'four', 'characters', 'lives', 'are', 'driven', 'drugs', 'haunting', 'heartbreaking', 'look', 'dark', 'side', 'addictions', 'personal', 'pick', 'best', 'film', '2000', 'story', 'centers', 'Harry', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'girlfriend', 'Marion', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'friend', 'Tyrone', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'mother', 'Sara', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'lives', 'are', 'driven', 'addictions', 'Harry', 'Tyrone', 'are', 'junkies', 'Marion', 'coke', 'addict', 'Sara', 'persuaded', 'loose', 'weight', 'possible', 'TV', 'appearance', 'hooked', 'diet', 'pills', 'film', 'showing', 'characters', 'dreams', 'nearing', 'fulfillment', 'Just', 'when', 'happiness', 'attainable', 'characters', 'lives', 'spiral', 'control', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'performances', 'are', 'stellar', 'particularly', 'Wayans', 'Burstyn', 'Wayans', 'took', 'completely', 'suprise', 'showing', 'can', 'actually', 'act', 'act', 'well', 'Burstyn', 'who', 'miles', 'rest', 'portrayal', 'lonely', 'pathetic', 'yet', 'well-meaning', 'Sara', 'incredible', 'was', 'Sara', 'whom', 'felt', 'most', 'sorry', 'entire', 'tragic', 'quartet', 'Burstyn', 'award', 'role', 'fact', 'not', 'opinion', 'Aronofsky', 'direction', 'film', 'visceral', 'kinetic', 'experience', 'use', 'split-screens', 'fast', 'cuts', 'infamous', 'snorri-cam', 'give', 'film', 'intense', 'addictive', 'feel', 'film', '20-minute-montage-from-hell', 'finale', 'blistering', 'disturbing', 'combination', 'Aronofsky', 'quick', 'paced', 'flash', 'coupled', 'impeccably', 'agonizing', 'performances', 'cast', 'punctuated', 'Clint', 'Mansell', 'score', 'performed', 'Kronos', 'Quartet', 'music', 'fittingly', 'somber', 'dirge-like', 'quot', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'quot', 'powerful', 'cinema', 'can', 'truly', 'be', 'called', 'work', 'art', 'haunting', 'nightmare', 'can', 'rightfully', 'be', 'called', 'beautiful']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

Trying to relax before beginning the last fifteen hundred miles home,  I decided to take in a movie I knew very little about other than what I'd seen on the Moby-scored trailer and a few laurels tossed by various newspaper critics, those articles skimmed so as not to ruin any surprises the movie might have in store.I staggered out of the theater two hours later, exhilarated and exhausted and physically nauseated by this grim tale of broken illusions and abuse. Those of the audience around me displayed similar reactions: wide-eyed, pale in places, struggling to find the words...words that could not adequately express what we had seen and endured. For me, `Requiem for a Dream' was the climax of my journey, a travelogue full of encounters with drugs and the people that use them...well, the first rush of a climax, anyway, for the prostitute/junkie/schizophrenic I picked up hitchhiking a few hours later was just as harrowing an experience as this movie, in a very similar way: I saw the end result of Jennifer Connely's character ranting and raving and attempting sexual innuendos right before my jaded eyes.This is not a pleasant movie. Nor is it one to be watched again and again, despite the superb cinematography and the incredible acting chops displayed by nearly all involved. But it is a movie that should be viewed by everyone at least once. Love it or hate it, the power of `Requiem for a Dream' cannot be denied. It sucks you in with hopes and dreams and beautiful illusions, then methodically crushes them one by one. The last scene, a frantic montage of images, documents the depravity in which abusers submit themselves and the physically/emotional/mental cost of synthetic pleasure; it strips away the Calvin Klien glamour of herion and shows this narcotic for what it is: the refinement of misery.In my opinion this movie should become mandatory curriculum for high school drug-education classes.",5,The Agony of the Ecstasy,999043200,"08 29, 2001",2001,2433,"['originally', 'viewed', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'first', 'day', 'run', 'Dobie', 'Theater', 'Austin', 'Texas', 'mid', 'November', '2000', 'date', 'was', 'last', 'leg', 'two-month', 'road', 'trip', 'United', 'States', 'having', 'time', 'witnessed', 'autumnal', 'changing', 'colors', 'eastern', 'seaboard', 'experienced', 'political', 'uproar', 'what', 'eventually', 'became', 'country', 'first', 'documented', 'coup', 'de', 'etat', 'also', 'had', 'several', 'encounters', 'drug', 'users', 'drug', 'dealers', 'course', 'journey', 'Trying', 'relax', 'beginning', 'last', 'fifteen', 'hundred', 'miles', 'home', 'decided', 'take', 'movie', 'knew', 'very', 'little', 'other', 'what', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Moby-scored', 'trailer', 'few', 'laurels', 'tossed', 'various', 'newspaper', 'critics', 'articles', 'skimmed', 'so', 'not', 'ruin', 'surprises', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'store.I', 'staggered', 'theater', 'two', 'hours', 'later', 'exhilarated', 'exhausted', 'physically', 'nauseated', 'grim', 'tale', 'broken', 'illusions', 'abuse', 'audience', 'displayed', 'similar', 'reactions', 'wide-eyed', 'pale', 'places', 'struggling', 'find', 'words', 'words', 'could', 'not', 'adequately', 'express', 'what', 'had', 'seen', 'endured', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'was', 'climax', 'journey', 'travelogue', 'full', 'encounters', 'drugs', 'people', 'use', 'well', 'first', 'rush', 'climax', 'anyway', 'prostitute/junkie/schizophrenic', 'picked', 'up', 'hitchhiking', 'few', 'hours', 'later', 'was', 'just', 'harrowing', 'experience', 'movie', 'very', 'similar', 'way', 'saw', 'end', 'result', 'Jennifer', 'Connely', 'character', 'ranting', 'raving', 'attempting', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'right', 'jaded', 'eyes.This', 'not', 'pleasant', 'movie', 'one', 'be', 'watched', 'again', 'again', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'incredible', 'acting', 'chops', 'displayed', 'nearly', 'involved', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'everyone', 'least', 'once', 'Love', 'hate', 'power', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'beautiful', 'illusions', 'then', 'methodically', 'one', 'one', 'last', 'scene', 'frantic', 'montage', 'images', 'documents', 'depravity', 'abusers', 'submit', 'physically/emotional/mental', 'cost', 'synthetic', 'pleasure', 'away', 'Calvin', 'Klien', 'glamour', 'herion', 'narcotic', 'what', 'refinement', 'misery.In', 'opinion', 'movie', 'should', 'become', 'mandatory', 'curriculum', 'high', 'school', 'drug-education', 'classes']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut
530943,A19JYLHD94K94D,B00003CXP1,Itamar Katz,"[1, 1]","Darren Aronofsky, it seems to me, is on his way to be one of the best, most influential directors of the 21st century. His work on Requiem For A Dream, like on Pi, is absolutely stunning, with brilliant use of experimental photography and editing techniques, short, thematically repeating shots (also used in Pi) and the original split-screen techenique. The movie is truly breathtaking, and I mean that most literally - I was starting to run out of oxygen after the first thirty minutes. And I only saw it on VCR. I can only imagine what this must be like in a huge, dark theatre. The harshness of the scenes and the fast, video-clip pace of the movie make it a very difficult, but very rewarding, experience.The seemingly complicated plot covers for a very simple idea. The story (This time adapted from a novel, the story for Pi was written by Aronofsky himself and was much more complicated and original) revolves around four main characters, and tells their four individual tales, with the common elements of addiction, illusion and their consequences. This idea, though, is materialized wonderfully, and makes for a very, very powerful movie. All four characters - Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his mother, Sarah (Ellen Burstyn), his girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and his friend and drug-dealing partner Tyron (Marlon Wayans), are remarkably well-developed, and each one is a full, real human being. Praise should go to Aronofsky but also to all four wonderful actors, especially Burstyn who did a really remarkable job as the TV junkie jewish mother.The movie is shocking, difficult, painful. You'll feel like your brain is being torn out and cut into little bits. But it's worth every minute.

I think most of us would not want to see it again. Is it good? Yes, it is. Is it too good? Yes. And that's exactly why most of us would say no to a second viewing...It's brutal, nightmarish and very, very real. Darren Aronofsky has pushed us to the limits of what is acceptable in movies and what crosses the line. Because it's unrated, it serves as a well-deserved warning to the general public. Some people probably won't be able to see it through to the end because it's so extreme. My mother couldn't. But even though it's extreme, it still remains a very realistic demonstration of the mechanics of addiction, volatile hope and complete destruction.

I felt my heart sinking in my chest as I watched 4 lives spiral out of control and all the while all you can do is observe and suffer with these poor souls. A lonely widow and her son and her son's girlfriend and his bestfriend are the main characters. All of which have reasonable ambition and go about to achieve these goals they desperately wish to attain and with disasterous results. The movie attacks the nature of addiction head on, not only peering into the lives of junkies but average citizens whom are heavily addicted to casual things such as delicious, fattening food, TV, the American dream, and hope and happiness. At the end of the film I felt very disturbed which only goes to prove how powerful this movie conveys its message. Director Darren Aronofsky's talent is excellent and the film is shot in great, creative ways straying completely away from traditional filming techniques. Aronofsky utilizes split screen, awkward camera angles and gritty tight facial shots to perfection. Ellen Bustyn delivers one of the best performances I've ever seen, watching her character completely fall apart was the most painful to see. She should have won an award for her part, one of the best actresses ever. These two people and their talents are the two most apparent great aspects of the movie and the supporting cast and crew dont stumble on their duties either. The sound is excellent, great use of audio working hand in hand with the visuals to serve up a completely disturbing sensory feast. Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly each turn in some of the best performances I've seen from each of them. Marlon Wayans in particular played his part with excellence, a far cry from the dim witted stoner parts he usually shrugs off on lesser films. This is definitley one of the best anti drug films I've ever seen, the only movie I've seen that is even competitive in the least is Traffic.

Not your run-of-the-mill love story with some teen idol and some teeny bopping girl, no.  It's about the reality of drug usage, mainly speed and heroin to be exact.  When you watch this film, you will see how all four of their lives slowly deteriorate into nothing as they become addicted to the drugs and make it their lives.  It starts off with Harry (Jared Leto) taking his mothers TV for drug money, starting off the journey to sadness.  Then they come up with a master plan to sell the drugs to gain a profit and have it easy for the rest of their lives.  But while they do this, Harry's mother Mary, gets a call saying she's going to be on television.  So she takes out a red dress inwhich she wore to Harry's graduation, and noticed she has gained some wait.  So she decides to go on a diet.  She tries everything, and nothing worked, so she calls a doctor who prescribes her &quot;uppers&quot;, or speed, if you will.  Then as they start to wear off, she takes more and more at one time to keep the buzz, causing her to have frightening halucinations.  On the other story, Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), a buddy of Harry's, gets busted after talking to his business connections and a shootout takes place.  So Harry needs to spend all his money bailing out Tyrone, using up most of the drug profits and the rest of his money, causing his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) to get extremely angered.

Very sad, very bleak, very real, very too much everything.We all live on dreams but what happens when these dreams become addictions? We get off the road, jump from the tracks, derail and we lose our souls.Every single type of addiction is studied or depicted here in their most stringent consequences.First television. You can dream of being on television. This will never happen, and you know it, but you go on dreaming and you become addicted to that dream just as much as you are to the television itself. And then you start behaving as if you were a star gone berserk.Second you can get addicted to slimming pills and in six months you become a zombie, the shadow of yourself, a non-entity, a guinea pig or guinea fowl if you prefer for doctors who are going to try all kinds of treatments not to cure you but to know what the effects of these treatments may be. You are an inmate in a hospital just like so many hundreds of thousands were inmates in Auschwitz.Third you can get addicted to drugs and then you will end either with one arm off and crippled for life, if they let you go out of the prison that will stand behind, or directly in the prison dreaming this time of freedom, though you were dreaming of paradise when you were free and you were shooting yourself with all kinds of heart accelerants, shooting yourself in both feet.Fourth you can get addicted to love in a way and a man in particular but, if you are, when that man will turn absent and non-existent any more you will be in a fix and you will have to replace him without being able to replace him. He will be your mental pimp and you will be his mental, but real indeed, shady lady or shady gentleman as for that, ready to do anything to get your fix, get some dough, maybe some baked dough, generally known as bread.Fifth there is another addiction that is dreadful. The addiction to old age that makes you believe you are not old and makes you behave as if you were not, but you can't not be, so you start cheating with life, taking pills, sitting in the sunshine, visiting other isolated old people, chanting and dancing when your son comes visit you, even if it is to steal your TV to bring it to a pawnshop of your friends.But the sixth and worst addiction of all is the addiction to solitude. That addiction can happen at any age, for any sex and in any circumstances. And don't believe it is because you live with someone, you share your daily life and chores with someone that you are not alone on this earth. Solitude is our daily lot and there is no fate in that. It is just a fact and you have to accept it. If by any chance you get addicted to that solitude, then your life is going to be hell on earth because everything, everyone is going to be a disruption, a disturbance, a dysfunctional item or individual or bore.When you meet people who are living an addiction to anything, you sure are going to come across a very disagreeable and very unpleasant experience. Addiction is the other side of the moon, the moon of life, the other side of it you can never see really because you are dead to the world, reason, logic, simple sanity and insane people don't see anymore: they fantasize.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,There is no end to addiction,1160265600,"10 8, 2006",2006,3226,"['disturbing', 'film', 'indeed', 'Very', 'sad', 'very', 'bleak', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'too', 'much', 'live', 'dreams', 'what', 'when', 'become', 'addictions', 'get', 'road', 'jump', 'tracks', 'derail', 'lose', 'souls.Every', 'single', 'type', 'addiction', 'studied', 'depicted', 'here', 'most', 'stringent', 'consequences.First', 'television', 'can', 'dream', 'being', 'television', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'know', 'go', 'dreaming', 'become', 'addicted', 'dream', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'are', 'television', 'then', 'start', 'behaving', 'were', 'star', 'gone', 'can', 'get', 'addicted', 'slimming', 'pills', 'six', 'months', 'become', 'zombie', 'shadow', 'non-entity', 'guinea', 'pig', 'guinea', 'fowl', 'prefer', 'doctors', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'try', 'kinds', 'treatments', 'not', 'cure', 'know', 'what', 'effects', 'treatments', 'may', 'be', 'are', 'inmate', 'hospital', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'were', 'inmates', 'Auschwitz.Third', 'can', 'get', 'addicted', 'drugs', 'then', 'will', 'end', 'either', 'one', 'arm', 'off', 'crippled', 'life', 'let', 'go', 'prison', 'will', 'stand', 'behind', 'directly', 'prison', 'dreaming', 'time', 'freedom', 'were', 'dreaming', 'paradise', 'when', 'were', 'free', 'were', 'shooting', 'kinds', 'heart', 'accelerants', 'shooting', 'feet.Fourth', 'can', 'get', 'addicted', 'love', 'way', 'man', 'particular', 'are', 'when', 'man', 'will', 'turn', 'absent', 'non-existent', 'more', 'will', 'be', 'fix', 'will', 'have', 'replace', 'being', 'able', 'replace', 'will', 'be', 'mental', 'pimp', 'will', 'be', 'mental', 'real', 'indeed', 'shady', 'lady', 'shady', 'gentleman', 'ready', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'fix', 'get', 'dough', 'maybe', 'baked', 'dough', 'generally', 'known', 'bread.Fifth', 'addiction', 'dreadful', 'addiction', 'old', 'age', 'believe', 'are', 'not', 'old', 'behave', 'were', 'not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'not', 'be', 'start', 'cheating', 'life', 'taking', 'pills', 'sitting', 'sunshine', 'visiting', 'other', 'isolated', 'old', 'people', 'chanting', 'dancing', 'when', 'son', 'visit', 'even', 'steal', 'TV', 'bring', 'pawnshop', 'friends.But', 'sixth', 'worst', 'addiction', 'addiction', 'solitude', 'addiction', 'can', 'happen', 'age', 'sex', 'circumstances', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'live', 'someone', 'share', 'daily', 'life', 'chores', 'someone', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'earth', 'Solitude', 'daily', 'lot', 'fate', 'just', 'fact', 'have', 'accept', 'chance', 'get', 'addicted', 'solitude', 'then', 'life', 'going', 'be', 'hell', 'earth', 'everything', 'everyone', 'going', 'be', 'disruption', 'disturbance', 'dysfunctional', 'item', 'individual', 'bore.When', 'meet', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'living', 'addiction', 'anything', 'sure', 'are', 'going', 'come', 'very', 'disagreeable', 'very', 'unpleasant', 'experience', 'Addiction', 'other', 'side', 'moon', 'moon', 'life', 'other', 'side', 'can', 'never', 'see', 'really', 'are', 'dead', 'world', 'reason', 'logic', 'simple', 'sanity', 'insane', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anymore', 'fantasize.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

After watching it over and over, I can say that I'm incredibly happy that I did. The cast is absolutely dead on. It was an experience just to watch each character through out the three acts. Especially Ellen Burstyn, who was so robbed at the Oscars. Burstyn conveyed so much range and emotion as Sara Goldfarb that it was like she was possesed. I was also surprised by Marlon Wayans who played a somewhat serious role and showed he could be a great actor one day.

As a longtime fan of her, I was pleased that she finally won an Oscar, for her performance in in the title role of  Erin Brochovich. However, if you really want to see the Best Actress of 2000, you'll need to see Ellen Burstyn's incredible performance in Darren Aronofsky's cutting edge, brilliant film &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;.Burstyn plays a mother whose heart desire is to simply get into an old red dress to appear on a television show. To help her slim down to fit into this garment, she slowly becomes addicted to a multi-colored set of pills that gradually overtake her sad, pathetic life. Burstyn portrays this woman's decent into hell with such style and horror you believe what you are seeing is true. Masterful acting from a masterful actor.Ellen's Burstyn's performance isn't the only reason to watch this movie. Aronofsky's movie is a no-holds barred look at four characters as their lives decend into the hell caused by drugs. Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and Jennifer Connelly add tremendously to this film. But Aronofsky does something not many film maker's today do: he doesn't protect his characters. In this film, the effects of their decisions lead to horrific results, and he never moves in to protect them.

530952,A34CVPZ30BA4GD,B00003CXP1,James Robert Dator,"[2, 3]","'Requiem for a dream' is quite possibly the most disturbing and brilliant films to look at the drug culture; how this culture manifests itself within society, as well as the people involved. The viewer is taken on a journey through a world of money, sex, vacuous relationships and of course drugs.The film centers around four addicts Harry (Jared Leto) his girlfriend Marion (Jeniffer Connelly)his best friend (Marlon Wayans) and his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn). We see how each of these characters falls into their own personal hell through the use of drugs and the motivation as to why they turned to the easy answer. For the friends it is due to the promise of easy money and get hooked 'trying out' their new gear. For Marion it is due to the relationship she has with Harry that causes her to become an addict. However the film succeeds on the highest level through the character Sara. How she starts using harmless uppers as a way to lose weight, and ends in hell.Cinematically the film is difficult to watch, the cinematography used is disorienting in many cases. This has good purpose however in trying to give the viewer an experience of what someone on drugs experiences. Director Darren Aronofsky used the interesting technique of split screening the action in the film to give us slices of two character's perspective which works brilliantly.People with a weak stomach for gritty, disturbing sex scenes or have qualms about seeing active drug taking (through needles in arms etc.) should not shy away from the film and would perhaps rather to see the rated version, with much of this cut out.The only film the 'Requiem for a dream' can be compared to is the British film 'Trainspotting' but the mood created in 'Requiem'is so disquieting that it makes 'Trainspotting' look like an episode of the 'Tellytubbies'.As far as the DVD goes you can't see this film in any grittier fashion than through the director's cut. The features are great, good interviews and commentary. The picture transfer is crystal clear (4.5 out of 5) and the sound transfer is fabulous in conveying mood (5 out of 5)No 'Requiem' isn't the kind of film you would take your mother to, nor is it one to watch with your friends if you just want to 'hang out and watch a film'. It has no happy ending, no tying of loose ends. And it's refreshing to see. This film has no answers to the problems of drugs, it's meerly an exposee of drugs in society. This film needed to be made and needs to be seen not only by people who are activly part of this drug culture, but also people who don't understand the motivations and vices people are related to through drugs.",4,A film that doesn't tie up all the loose ends.,1014681600,"02 26, 2002",2002,2639,"[""'Requiem"", 'dream', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'disturbing', 'brilliant', 'films', 'look', 'drug', 'culture', 'how', 'culture', 'society', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'involved', 'viewer', 'taken', 'journey', 'world', 'money', 'sex', 'vacuous', 'relationships', 'course', 'drugs.The', 'film', 'centers', 'four', 'addicts', 'Harry', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'girlfriend', 'Marion', 'Jeniffer', 'Connelly', 'best', 'friend', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'mother', 'Sara', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'see', 'how', 'characters', 'falls', 'own', 'personal', 'hell', 'use', 'drugs', 'motivation', 'why', 'turned', 'easy', 'answer', 'friends', 'due', 'promise', 'easy', 'money', 'get', 'hooked', ""'trying"", 'out', 'new', 'gear', 'Marion', 'due', 'relationship', 'Harry', 'become', 'addict', 'However', 'film', 'highest', 'level', 'character', 'Sara', 'How', 'using', 'harmless', 'uppers', 'way', 'lose', 'weight', 'hell.Cinematically', 'film', 'difficult', 'watch', 'cinematography', 'used', 'disorienting', 'many', 'cases', 'good', 'purpose', 'however', 'trying', 'give', 'viewer', 'experience', 'what', 'someone', 'drugs', 'experiences', 'Director', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'used', 'interesting', 'technique', 'split', 'screening', 'action', 'film', 'give', 'slices', 'two', 'character', 'perspective', 'brilliantly.People', 'weak', 'stomach', 'gritty', 'disturbing', 'sex', 'scenes', 'have', 'qualms', 'seeing', 'active', 'drug', 'taking', 'needles', 'arms', 'etc', 'should', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'film', 'would', 'perhaps', 'rather', 'see', 'rated', 'version', 'much', 'cut', 'only', 'film', ""'Requiem"", 'dream', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'British', 'film', ""'Trainspotting"", 'mood', 'created', ""'Requiem'is"", 'so', 'disquieting', ""'Trainspotting"", 'look', 'episode', ""'Tellytubbies'.As"", 'far', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'grittier', 'fashion', 'director', 'cut', 'features', 'are', 'great', 'good', 'interviews', 'commentary', 'picture', 'transfer', 'crystal', 'clear', '4.5', '5', 'sound', 'transfer', 'fabulous', 'conveying', 'mood', '5', '5', ""'Requiem"", ""n't"", 'kind', 'film', 'would', 'take', 'mother', 'one', 'watch', 'friends', 'just', 'want', ""'hang"", 'out', 'watch', 'film', 'happy', 'ending', 'tying', 'loose', 'ends', 'refreshing', 'see', 'film', 'answers', 'problems', 'drugs', 'meerly', 'exposee', 'drugs', 'society', 'film', 'needed', 'be', 'made', 'needs', 'be', 'seen', 'not', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'activly', 'part', 'drug', 'culture', 'also', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'motivations', 'vices', 'people', 'are', 'related', 'drugs']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

The film has superb acting, (leading the way: Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Marlon Wayan and Jennifer Connely). This film carries almost the same message as Traffic, but instead they give a more gritty and horrifying look into the world of drugs. The film will get the message ""Don't Do Drugs"" through to anyone.The cast does a superb job (especially Ellen Burstyn, who did a more than Oscar Worthy performance) not only that, they horrify you with the vision of the addict and just how truly far they will go to get their ""fix"".The fact that ""Traffic"" won the Oscar, does'nt mean that Requeim for a Dream isnt better, but rather the Academy dropped the ball, and missed, what was sure to be a clean sweep of every Oscar. That proves not only the Academy, but the every day person is biast with the diffrent film companies (Miramax, Artisan & New Line) because of the marketing.

530956,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,B00003CXP1,Jeff  Farrow,"[0, 1]","At the beginning of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, director Aronofsky forces you to participate, to become both a victim & accomplice of his film. I don't see how the device he uses would have the same impact in a theatre setting. I won't spoil the effect for people who haven't seen the film at home.Ellen Burstyn is very gutsy to have taken on the role of a mother turned psychotic by prescription uppers to ""lose weight."" Her characterization defines ""tour de force."" In effect she plays two roles: the role of a middle-aged woman who gets hooked on speed, and the bizarre & hypersexualized woman on TV. What starts out as humorous & quirky, quickly becomes deadly serious. It was her extraordinary performance that influenced my rating from what would have been 3 stars to 4. She gets 5.The son, his girl friend, and a male friend are all addicted to heroin. Their spiral downward coincides with that of the mother's, but from separate locations as all communication breaks down. Only the son & his male friend remain on speaking term--and even that's soon busted up by increasingly horrific ocurrences.The main theme of the movie is naturally that of drug induced social alienation. The two lovers, so close at the beginning, become completely driven apart by their addiction. This process was very effectiively presented & played out by the 3 young actors. I thought they were all very good.REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, unfortunately, goes way over the top about halfway through as addiction overwhelms reality. It's like throwing a barrage of images at a celluloid wall just see what sticks. What begins as a valid & visceral social commentary, descends into horror melodrama.

530957,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00003CXP1,Jeffrey Leach,"[13, 15]","&quot;Requiem for a Dream,&quot; Darren Aronofsky's film version of Hubert Selby's 1978 novel of the same name, will definitely attain cult status in coming years. Selby's story about a quartet of drug addicts employs a highly unorthodox literary style of slang, omitted punctuation, and run-on sentences that stretch for miles. Director Aronofsky echoed the novel with a host of unusual techniques for the movie version: fast editing, bizarre camera angles, and nightmarish effects created a riveting and nervous film that is grimly effective in conveying the horrors of addiction. Starring Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connolly, Marlon Wayans, and Jared Leto; &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; will leave a lasting impression on anyone who takes the time to view it. As much as I enjoyed the film, I read the book before I saw the film and it is my opinion that the book does a much better job of delving into the personal torments of each of the major characters. The reason is simple: no film trumps a good book. Some pictures come close, but no movie ever made can compete with the power of your imagination. Still, &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; comes amazingly close to fully realizing Selby's bleak visions.&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; tracks the rise and eventual fall of Harry Goldfarb, his mother Sara, his girlfriend Marion, and friend Tyrone as all four individuals indulge in addictive substances and behaviors. For Harry, Marion, and Tyrone the problem is heroin. For Sara Goldfarb, her initial drug of choice is television followed by a particularly nasty encounter with diet pills. Throughout the first part of the film, all four see their lives radically improved by drugs. Harry and Marion meet and build a relationship through drug use and make tentative plans to run their own small business. Moreover, Harry can forget about the pain of his father's death. His friend Tyrone discovers the same sort of benefit as he tries to forget about his deceased mother. Things really take off for the trio when Harry and Tyrone buy a large quantity of heroin and make a bundle of money selling the stuff to local junkies. Sara Goldfarb's addictions are more insidious and ultimately more devastating. Shattered by the death of her husband, she spends her days ensconced in her apartment watching smarmy infomercial programs and eating sweets. When Sara receives a phone call offering her a chance to appear on one of these television programs, her elation knows no bounds. Recognizing her burgeoning weight presents a potential problem, Goldfarb visits a quack to obtain diet pills. Within a few days, things couldn't be better as her hunger pangs disappear and she loses enough weight to almost fit into her old red dress. Any day now that application for her television appearance will arrive in the mail and Sara will be the toast of her apartment building.All good things must come to an end, and in the world of drug addiction that end is often a fate worse than death. What started out as a recreational activity for Harry, Marion, and Tyrone soon turns into a hardcore addiction. Waking up in the morning with the shakes is the first sign of real trouble, but the trio continually reassures themselves that they are merely experiencing a small bump on the road to their dreams. Soon, serious fractures appear between the three when the heroin supply on the streets of New York mysteriously dries up. Withdrawal effects and the high price of existing supplies of heroin soon force painful decisions. Harry allows Marion to pay a &quot;special&quot; visit to her former psychologist in order to obtain a few hundred dollars. Meanwhile, Harry and Tyrone spend their time roaming the blasted landscapes of New York City in search of supply, and since it is the middle of winter the two often endure frigid conditions with little hope of success. When Harry gets the brilliant idea to take their meager funds and drive to Florida in search of heroin and Marion sells her mind and her body for drugs, you know the end is near. Sara Goldfarb's descent into madness begins when the diet pills no longer quash her desire for food. Even worse, the application she filled out is in limbo. As the hope of appearing on television fades with each passing day, Sara doubles her daily dose of the pills in a last ditch effort to lose those last few pounds. All of the characters' agonies are brilliantly executed onscreen, but Sara's is absolutely soul shattering in its intensity.The performances elevate &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; above the usual &quot;drug&quot; message film. Especially noteworthy is Ellen Burstyn in the role of Sara Goldfarb. Talk about disappearing in a role! This fine actress should have won an Oscar for her metamorphosis from a rather harmless soul into a quaking, sweating wreck lurching through the streets of New York in her tattered red dress. Her monologue to Harry about why she takes the pills to lose weight brought tears to my eyes. Just when you think Sara Goldfarb cannot possibly sink further into the depths of despair, Aronofsky piles on even more indignities.&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is not a film for the faint of heart, but if you really want to view it in all of its splendor the director's cut DVD is the version to get. Included on the disc are plenty of extras: a commentary from Aronofsky, deleted scenes, an interview of Hubert Selby conducted by Ellen Burstyn, production notes, and a behind the scenes documentary. A powerful film not easily banished from the mind, I certainly hope that those who watch this picture follow through and read the book. Selby's novel, which does a few things the movie does not, is even more harrowing in its subject matter.",5,"Please read the book, too!",1069891200,"11 27, 2003",2003,5719,"['quot', 'Requiem',

Tilley Jr. ""goatman_1""","[1, 1]","I recently wrote a review for &quot;Blow&quot; comparing it to &quot;Traffic&quot; (which I thought was overhyped and overrated).  It's easy for me to lump all these movies together because of they all share the same theme: drugs.  Let me be blunt, comparing those other two movies (even Blow which I enjoyed) to Requiem is like comparing &quot;Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure&quot; to &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.  No contest.If you're already on edge worrying about current events and world conditions STAY AWAY FROM THIS FLICK.  It might be enough to drive you right over the edge.  It's like an anxiety attack in a bottle.  It's so real and so intense that for me, I had to keep reminding myself it was just a movie, which is something I rarely have to do.  If you've ever had a family member who's battled a drug habit, or had a drug habit yourself, this flick will stand your hairs on end.  All the mania and euphoria of drugs is shrouded by a sense of loss and disappointment that almost always comes to those who clean up, or lose their personal battles.No doubt it's director Darren Aronofsky's deranged camera angles and constant bombardment of imagery that contribute most to the film's power and intensity.  It has all the subtlety of a gamg of thugs armed with chains and clubs beating you senseless without ever allowing you a moment to catch your breath.  Even the quiet moments are filled with so much heartbreaking tragedy that the viewer is allowed no reprieve.Incredible performances all four main players.  Ellen Burstyn deserves every kind of award that an actress can get, but it was Marlon Wayans performance that kept me in awe because it was just so unexpected.  Wayans shows that he has the talent and the skill to be a true heavy weight.  The interaction between Jared Leto and the always underrated Jennifer Connelly was what I found most disturbing about the flick.  Watching their relationship disintegrate is just too convincing and genuine at times.So to sum up... I'm not sure how to sum this movie up.  It's not for the faint of heart.  It is for anyone who's sick of the mediocre b.s. that hollywood has been pumping down our throats.  A movie like this comes out every once and awhile and makes you remember why you watch movies.  They aren't just for escape or entertainment, sometimes they CAN transcend into something important and powerful.

""A New Yorker""","[7, 7]","Remember the anti-drug commercial where a girl points to an egg, says, ""this is your brain,"" and then screams, ""this is your brain on drugs!"" as she smashes the egg with a skillet and proceeds to demolish the entire kitchen, screaming, ""and this is what drugs do to your family, this is what they do to your future..."" and so on? We'll this story does give you that indication but it's so much more.After watching this I thought it was the most harrowing, unsettling, and yet utterly compelling film dealing with the issue of drug use, and the effects it has on those involved I have ever seen. This is, and I state for the record, in no way glorifying, sensationalizing, or condoning drug use in any way. Took me ages to finally see this flick but thankfully it's been recommended to me base on my experience with Aronofsky's recent film ""The Fountain.""It has a brilliant ensemble cast. Ellen Burnstyn had my heart by the end as I watched her truly sweet and charming character of Sara Goldfarb slowly deteriorate because of an addiction. I cannot believe she was denied an Oscar for this role, because it's among the best on-screen performances I've ever seen. It would be a crime in my mind to not commend Jared Leto on his performance. The job he does in the film seems to be quite underrated, but his role as Harry Goldfarb came out as my favorite character. His acting is superb in all senses, and its clear to me that his research into the role paid off. Big time. Because he's put me off drugs of all forms with his depiction of an addict. Jennifer Connely could've very easily made her character of Marion Silver a melodramatic, difficult to watch hunk of ....., but thank the good lord she didn't. It takes a great actor to walk the fine line between real and fake, and she does it so wonderfully well. She may have been playing a supporting role, but it never seemed that way to me. Her performance will stay with me for a long time to come. Marlon Wayans was also amazing in his performance and the fact that he managed to make me remember his character of Tyrone C Love says a lot.The directing is nothing short of amazing. Darren Aronofsky creates an excellent mood, making great use of cameras mounted to the actors, hallucination sequences, split camera shots and shows he his artistic sense in a brilliant montage at the end of the film, which was one of my highlights, and the score is beautiful, and makes the mood even more hostile at times. All up, ""Requiem For A Dream"" is not for the squeamish or faint of heart, but it's a film that everyone should see at some time in their lives. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that you may never see another film that leaves you more scared, shocked and affected mentally than ""Requiem For A Dream.""

530963,A1B3HGBE9GAI08,B00003CXP1,Jeremy Heilman,"[7, 12]","Unfortunately, I think this film fails to successfully meld style with substance. I recently watched Godard&#8217;s Band of Outsiders in its current theatrical re-release, and when I finished that refreshing experience, I realized what it was that irked me so much about Darren Aronofsky&#8217;s Requiem. Godard&#8217;s film is specifically about an addiction to media causing a disassociation with reality. Requiem for a Dream is about drugs fueling that addiction to a vision of the &#8220;better life&#8221; that the media uses to tantalize us. Both films are stylistically bold, but since Godard&#8217;s is foremost about an addiction specifically to media (i.e. the characters believe real life should live up to the standard of films), and he&#8217;s able to imbue his characters with a youthful gusto, his stylistic choices seem integrated into his narrative.Aronofsky&#8217;s excess of style seems intrusive by comparison. He never really is able to make us examine these characters as real people (e.g. he has Ellen Burstyn DEVOUR the scenery). They remain stereotypes (i.e. specters that don&#8217;t really exist EXCEPT in the media), and therefore feel that they contribute to the problem of false media expectations more than they help expose it.  They are very fictional characters complaining that their lives aren&#8217;t fictional enough.The drug sequences seem to be just more of the media telling us how life is. We&#8217;re supposed to get the impression that, due to Aronofsky&#8217;s technical brilliance, we&#8217;ve seen how it is to be addicted to drugs after this film, but that dishonesty bothers me here&#8230; We&#8217;ve simply watched a murky, dreadful movie.",2,A lot of dazzle with a little effect,999648000,"09 5, 2001",2001,1689,"['Unfortunately', 'think', 'film', 'successfully', 'meld', 'style', 'substance', 'recently', 'watched', 'Godard', '8217', 's', 'Band', 'Outsiders', 'current', 'theatrical', 're-release', 'when', 'finished', 'refreshing', 'experience', 'realized', 'what', 'was', 'irked', 'so', 'much', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', '8217', 'Requiem', 'Godard', '8217', 's', 'film', 'specifically', 'addiction', 'media', 'causing', 'disassociation', 'reality', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'drugs', 'fueling', 'addiction', 'vision', '8220', 'better', 'life', '8221', 'media', 'tantalize', 'films', 'are', 'stylistically', 'bold', 'Godard', '8217', 'foremost', 'addiction', 'specifically', 'media', 'i.e', 'characters', 'believe', 'real', 'life', 'should', 'live', 'up', 'standard', 'films', '8217', 'able', 'imbue', 'characters', 'youthful', 'gusto', 'stylistic', 'choices', 'seem', 'integrated', 'narrative.Aronofsky', '8217', 's', 'excess', 'style', 'intrusive', 'comparison', 'never', 'really', 'able', 'make', 'examine', 'characters', 'real', 'people', 'e.g', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'DEVOUR', 'scenery', 'remain', 'stereotypes', 'i.e', 'specters', 'don', '8217', 'really', 'exist', 'EXCEPT', 'media', 'therefore', 'feel', 'contribute', 'problem', 'false', 'media', 'expectations', 'more', 'help', 'expose', 'are', 'very', 'fictional', 'characters', 'complaining', 'lives', 'aren', '8217', 'fictional', 'enough.The', 'drug', 'sequences', 'seem', 'be', 'just', 'more', 'media', 'telling', 'how', 'life', '8217', 're', 'supposed', 'get', 'impression', 'due', 'Aronofsky', '8217', 'technical', 'brilliance', '8217', 'seen', 'how', 'be', 'addicted', 'drugs', 'film', 'dishonesty', 'bothers', 'here', '8230', '8217', 'simply', 'watched', 'murky', 'dreadful', 'movie']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

That dream is over or never existed for the people in this show. The movie can be said to make many statements, but the one it made for me more than any other is: What makes people turn to drugs? Harry (Jared Leto), his mother Sarah Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and Harry's best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are four people who's lives seem empty and bordering on despair. Harry, Marion and Tyrone love to get high, with heroin being their favorite escape. Harry's mom, who's hooked on television and mistakenly thinks she's going to be on her favorite program wants to lose weight and becomes addicted to diet pills. She loses weight but becomes emaciated in the process, starts hallucinating, and seems to be losing her mind. Harry warns her of the dangers of taking all these ""uppers"" (he ought to know) but it falls on deaf ears. Things are going good for Harry, Marion and Tyrone for awhile but things dry up and coming down is painful. They are so hooked that they're willing to do things they wouldn't normally do just to get a fix. At the end of the show it's hard to decide who to feel the most sorry for. All four of their lives have become a virtual hell. Maybe the best statement this show makes is: No matter how hopeless your life may seem, drugs aren't the answer. In the end they leave you worse off than you were before you started. The soundtrack is piercing at times, but fits with the context of the movie.

As a lifelong fan of oddball, disturbing and surreal films of all variety, I would say this ranks in the top ten in terms of sheer unpleasantness.  And that's saying a lot. I remember hearing about this movie quite a bitwhen it was released and writing it off as another ""Basketball Diaries"", and that's what I expected when I popped it in my DVD player.  Wow, was I wrong.But the unpleasantness is not gratuitous; in fact, Arofonsky has done everyone a service by translating Shelby's book into film in such a visceral and brutal manner. The performances are appropriately desperate and the actors themselves mean a lot less than what they are intended to represent: surrender, through different means, to the forces of self-destruction, narcissism, and ultimate disintegration.  One thing, though; Jennifer Connelly's character Marion would not be looking as good as she does at the end of the film at all if she was such a fervent heroin user.Otherwise, there is not one false note in this hellish descent into the pits of human degradation and nothing is too extreme.  Anyone who has experienced addiction in their lives will recognize from the first scene in which Harry boosts his mother's television set that while a lot of the Kafkaesque and bleakly surreal are employed here, it is all too real.

Surprisingly, its much more than that and I appreciate the message delivered in this film. Harry Played by (Jared Leto) lives with his mom Sara (Ellen Burstyn). Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly)and his friend Tyrone (Marlan Wayans) are tied up with the drug business, there unfortunate habits eventually catch up to them they seem to let go of reality. Meanwhile Harry's mom is also caught up with the popular use of Diet pills. His mother is A Televison Junkie who is lonely and wants to get on ""Tappy Tibbons Show"" which is a similar to a Richard Simmons program played by Christopher Mcdonald. Just like Harry, His mother fantasizes, she wants to lose weight and fit in that red dress so she can be famous. I won't give away the ending, but it isn't pretty. then again most movies about raging drug addicts aren't pretty, hence, the movie Transpotting. What did attract me to this movie is the message. What the director was trying to portray is that almost every thing has the potential to qualify as a ""Drug."" For example, Harry's mom is addicted to television and can't seem to get a grip on herself, Harry and Tyrone can't seem to stop living life on the edge ect. You get the point. Overall the acting is stunning as well, the whole cast especially Ellen Burstyn give outstanding performances. As for the dvd, fans of this movie won't be dissapointed either. For one thing we get the director's cut of the film, with some good interiews with the writer and cast. A good solid commentary and some interesting deleted scenes. On The documentary we get a good behind the scenes on the story and setting on Coney Island. As for quality, the director obviously, intended to use a dark grainy transfer to set the mood of the movie, which he does a great job here as well.

530973,A3GTH1VXNRYZS5,B00003CXP1,"""j_james""","[1, 12]","Most reviews--whether they are written by professionals or amateurs--talk about how brilliantly this film is made. All of those reviews are correct. Aronofsky is one of the finest young directors alive, the performances (with the exception of Jared Leto, who is merely good) are all excellent, the audio track is chilling and the visuals in this picture are truly magnificent. Even the post-production elements--such as editing--are nearly perfect.But I think that most reviews don't see past the brilliant filmmaking to find the glaring drawbacks of Requiem. First, these characters are two-dimensional, at best. The viewer doesn't get get a feel for their pasts (with, perhaps, the exception of Ellen Burstyn's character, who is made three dimensional by the actress, not the writer or director) or their motivations or their dreams or their wishes for life before they became addicts. That's a dangerous thing to do in any film, but especially in one like this; one that is expecting the viewer to care about the eventual tragedies these people face. One that actually requires the viewer to care in order for the feature's political statement to mean anything, to have any relevance. Did this movie overcome the character development? To a certain extent, yes it did, if only because the performances were so amazing and the technical elements of the film so flawless. Nonetheless, Requiem would have succeeded even more if these characters had been more real.That brings me to a thematic discussion. Requiem, much like Traffic, looks into addiction, drug use and it's effects. Unlike Traffic, however, Requiem doesn't take a relatively neutral stance while doing it's best to accurately depict the drug world. Aronofsky, in fact, makes this film a resounding condemnation of drugs, as if saying that any and every person who uses drugs will eventually meet the same fate these characters do. Not that it matters, but I have persoanlly never done a drug (other than alcohol); I do know several people who use occasional substances and I only know one person who's life has been significantly negatively effected, though no where near to the same degree as these characters; most users I know are in fact quasi-users and lead perfectly normal lives. What I'm saying is this: drugs don't inevitably lead to these sorts of situations; to imply that they do--as Requiem for a Dream most certainly does--is not only excessively pessimistic, it's also a bit insulting. Setting aside any policital views, Aronofsky, would have been better served if he'd had at least one sane, occasional user who's life succeeded, than he was by having a plethora of spiralling hell-like situations for every character.Ultimately, is this film worth viewing? Absolutely. It is a very impressive cinematic achievement, but there are still some glaring flaws that shouldn't be ignored.",3,"It's been talked about many times, but maybe not like this",1022544000,"05 28, 2002",2002,2864,"['Most', 'reviews', 'are', 'written', 'professionals', 'amateurs', 'talk', 'how', 'brilliantly', 'film', 'made', 'reviews', 'are', 'correct', 'Aronofsky', 'one', 'finest', 'young', 'directors', 'alive', 'performances', 'exception', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'who', 'merely', 'good', 'are', 'excellent', 'audio', 'track', 'chilling', 'visuals', 'picture', 'are', 'truly', 'magnificent', 'Even', 'post-production', 'elements', 'such', 'editing', 'are', 'nearly', 'perfect.But', 'think', 'most', 'reviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'brilliant', 'filmmaking', 'find', 'glaring', 'drawbacks', 'Requiem', 'First', 'characters', 'are', 'two-dimensional', 'best', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'get', 'get', 'feel', 'pasts', 'perhaps', 'exception', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'character', 'who', 'made', 'three', 'dimensional', 'actress', 'not', 'writer', 'director', 'motivations', 'dreams', 'wishes', 'life', 'became', 'addicts', 'dangerous', 'thing', 'do', 'film', 'especially', 'one', 'one', 'expecting', 'viewer', 'care', 'eventual', 'tragedies', 'people', 'face', 'One', 'actually', 'viewer', 'care', 'order', 'feature', 'political', 'statement', 'mean', 'anything', 'have', 'relevance', 'Did', 'movie', 'character', 'development', 'certain', 'extent', 'yes', 'did', 'only', 'performances', 'were', 'so', 'amazing', 'technical', 'elements', 'film', 'so', 'flawless', 'Nonetheless', 'Requiem', 'would', 'have', 'succeeded', 'even', 'more', 'characters', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'real.That', 'thematic', 'discussion', 'Requiem', 'much', 'Traffic', 'addiction', 'drug', 'use', 'effects', 'Traffic', 'however', 'Requiem', ""n't"", 'take', 'relatively', 'neutral', 'stance', 'doing', 'best', 'accurately', 'depict', 'drug', 'world', 'Aronofsky', 'fact', 'film', 'resounding', 'condemnation', 'drugs', 'saying', 'person', 'who', 'drugs', 'will', 'eventually', 'meet', 'same', 'fate', 'characters', 'do', 'Not', 'have', 'persoanlly', 'never', 'done', 'drug', 'other', 'alcohol', 'do', 'know', 'several', 'people', 'who', 'use', 'occasional', 'substances', 'only', 'know', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'life', 'been', 'significantly', 'negatively', 'effected', 'where', 'near', 'same', 'degree', 'characters', 'most', 'users', 'know', 'are', 'fact', 'quasi-users', 'lead', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'lives', 'What', ""'m"", 'saying', 'drugs', 'do', ""n't"", 'inevitably', 'lead', 'sorts', 'situations', 'imply', 'do', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'only', 'excessively', 'pessimistic', 'also', 'bit', 'insulting', 'Setting', 'aside', 'policital', 'views', 'Aronofsky', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', ""'d"", 'had', 'least', 'one', 'sane', 'occasional', 'user', 'who', 'life', 'succeeded', 'was', 'having', 'plethora', 'spiralling', 'hell-like', 'situations', 'character.Ultimately', 'film', 'viewing', 'Absolutely', 'very', 'impressive', 'cinematic', 'achievement', 'are', 'still', 'glaring', 'flaws', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'ignored']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

530978,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00003CXP1,Joe Sherry,"[4, 5]","A film by Darren AronofskyThis is a powerful movie.  While on one hand it would be simplistic to say that this is a movie about drugs, it is also necessary and accurate to say that the movie is about drugs.  It would be just as accurate to say the movie is about addiction.  This movie is broken up into three stages: Summer, Fall, and Winter.  Each stage tracks the descent of the characters into addiction and we watch as their lives fall apart.This is the story of four people: Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), her son Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and their friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans).  We start the movie with our characters about to improve their lives.  After Sara receives a phone call telling her that she has been selected to appear on television she is obsessed with losing weight and fitting into a dress that she wore years ago.  She sees a doctor that was recommended by a friend (the doctor seems like a quack doctor, however), and begins taking diet pills.  Harry and Tyrone have a plan to start dealing some higher quality drugs and make money so they can buy some of the highest quality cocaine and sell that and make serious money.  Marion is along for the ride and has dreams of her own about designing clothing.  At first everything is working fine and we are in the Summer period of the story where everything is at its brightest and warmest and most positive.  But it isn't to last.Harry recognizes that the diet pills that his mother are taking are nothing more than speed, with a downer to help her sleep at night.  He sees the signs of addiction and that she is starting to become strung out, but all she can see is that she is losing weight.  Harry and Tyrone are experiencing great success, but it is all starting to turn sour.  The rest of the movie is the slow (though at times rapid) descent into addiction and the repercussions of the drug addiction and lives they are leading.  There are arrests and Marion is now willing to trade her body for drugs since Harry is not able to provide her with the drugs she needs.  It keeps getting worse and worse and spiraling out of control for all four characters and the end of the movie doesn't give them redemption, but rather rock bottom.As I said, this is a powerful movie, but by no means is this film an uplifting movie.  Things start bad, improve a little it and just get worse from there.  This is a harrowing look at drug addiction and there is no truly sympathetic character whom I care for and hope things turn around for.  What this movie does have are fantastic acting performances from everyone involved (though I am somewhat less impressed with Connelly).  I have been impressed with both of Araonofsky's movies (the other being ""Pi""), but they have both been emotionally gloomy pictures.  I look forward to seeing what he does next and while I think this is an excellent movie, I think I'll be okay never seeing it again.",4,powerful,1078185600,"03 2, 2004",2004,2943,"['film', 'Darren', 'AronofskyThis', 'powerful', 'movie', 'one', 'hand', 'would', 'be', 'simplistic', 'say', 'movie', 'drugs', 'also', 'necessary', 'accurate', 'say', 'movie', 'drugs', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'accurate', 'say', 'movie', 'addiction', 'movie', 'broken', 'up', 'three', 'stages', 'Summer', 'Fall', 'Winter', 'stage', 'descent', 'characters', 'addiction', 'watch', 'lives', 'fall', 'apart.This', 'story', 'four', 'people', 'Sara', 'Goldfarb', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'son', 'Harry', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'girlfriend', 'Marion', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'friend', 'Tyrone', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'start', 'movie', 'characters', 'improve', 'lives', 'Sara', 'phone', 'call', 'telling', 'been', 'selected', 'appear', 'television', 'obsessed', 'losing', 'weight', 'fitting', 'dress', 'wore', 'years', 'ago', 'doctor', 'was', 'recommended', 'friend', 'doctor', 'quack', 'doctor', 'however', 'taking', 'diet', 'pills', 'Harry', 'Tyrone', 'have', 'plan', 'start', 'dealing', 'higher', 'quality', 'drugs', 'make', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'highest', 'quality', 'cocaine', 'sell', 'make', 'serious', 'money', 'Marion', 'along', 'ride', 'dreams', 'own', 'designing', 'clothing', 'first', 'everything', 'working', 'fine', 'are', 'Summer', 'period', 'story', 'where', 'everything', 'brightest', 'warmest', 'most', 'positive', ""n't"", 'last.Harry', 'recognizes', 'diet', 'pills', 'mother', 'are', 'taking', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'speed', 'downer', 'help', 'sleep', 'night', 'signs', 'addiction', 'starting', 'become', 'strung', 'can', 'see', 'losing', 'weight', 'Harry', 'Tyrone', 'are', 'experiencing', 'great', 'success', 'starting', 'turn', 'sour', 'rest', 'movie', 'slow', 'times', 'rapid', 'descent', 'addiction', 'repercussions', 'drug', 'addiction', 'are', 'leading', 'are', 'arrests', 'Marion', 'now', 'willing', 'trade', 'body', 'drugs', 'Harry', 'not', 'able', 'provide', 'drugs', 'getting', 'worse', 'worse', 'spiraling', 'control', 'four', 'characters', 'end', 'movie', ""n't"", 'give', 'redemption', 'rather', 'rock', 'bottom.As', 'said', 'powerful', 'movie', 'means', 'film', 'uplifting', 'movie', 'Things', 'start', 'bad', 'improve', 'little', 'just', 'get', 'worse', 'there', 'harrowing', 'look', 'drug', 'addiction', 'truly', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'whom', 'care', 'hope', 'things', 'turn', 'around', 'What', 'movie', 'have', 'are', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'performances', 'everyone', 'involved', 'am', 'somewhat', 'less', 'impressed', 'Connelly', 'have', 'been', 'impressed', 'Araonofsky', 'movies', 'other', 'being', 'Pi', 'have', 'been', 'emotionally', 'gloomy', 'pictures', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'what', 'next', 'think', 'excellent', 'movie', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'okay', 'never', 'seeing', 'again']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

Ryan ""Scott Ryan""","[3, 5]","Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is going to be on television -- so, needing to lose a little weight in order to fit into her nice red dress, she starts a regimen of diet pills. Meanwhile, her son Harry (Jared Leto) keeps hocking her TV to buy drugs for himself, his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). And from there, everything pretty much spirals downward to hell._Requiem for a Dream_ is based on the book of the same name (which I haven't read) by Hubert Selby, Jr. (who also cowrote the screenplay and makes a brief cameo appearance as the 'Laughing Guard'). Essentially, it's a harrowing study of addiction and its effect on hope. Although the film's primary focus is on drugs, other objects of addiction (television, sex, even food) take turns in the spotlight. And it's all pretty grueling. (Parts are darkly comic at the same time, as when Sara has to sneak into the room so as not to arouse her hungry refrigerator.)With a lesser cast, or with any more self-conscious moralism in the screenplay, it would have toppled off of its highwire and turned into just another Special Episode of 'Blossom'. And with even a _little_ more of its already-overused nerve-jangling speedy-uppy-slowy-downy Technique-with-a-capital-T, it would have toppled over in the other direction and become just another pretentiously arty soap opera.And that would have been a disaster. The topic itself isn't exactly new; what else could there possibly be to show us about it that we didn't see years ago in e.g. _Lost Weekend_ and _The Man With the Golden Arm_ and _Valley of the Dolls_ (never mind _Reefer Madness_ and _The Cocaine Fiends_)? Had this devolved into just another film in an already overloaded genre, it wouldn't merely have failed; it would have crashed and burned.But it manages, somehow, to work. As I suggested above, a lot of the credit has to go to the cast; Ellen Burstyn is by God magnificent, and the three younger leads bring life to a trio that could easily have cliched itself into a sort of bizarro prequel to 'The Mod Squad'. Credit also goes to the appropriately jagged score by Clint Mansell (much of it performed by the Kronos Quartet).The lion's share, though, goes to director Darren Aronofsky (who was also the other cowriter of the screenplay). With nearly anybody else, I'd suspect a desire to impress the world by making his second movie an Idiosyncratic, Shocking, Yet Deeply Significant Work of Art. But that suspicion doesn't really make sense applied to a guy whose _first_ movie was _Pi_. (This one is actually somewhat _less_ gonzo than that one.) Appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, Aronofsky has his craft under careful control.Overall, then, this is a much, much better movie than it has any right to be. There's nothing really new in it; it's right on the edge of unbearably preachy (and on a relatively uncontroversial subject; does anybody think addiction is _good_?); it's got a strong flavor of deliberate 'art-housiness', if you know what I mean. But much to my surprise, it succeeds anyway, and somehow its characters manage to become sufficiently real for us to care about them even while they're totally screwing themselves up.It's not cheerful, it's not pretty, it's not even easy to watch. But I'm impressed enough to watch it again.

530986,A1U5EIW985DXXA,B00003CXP1,"Jonathan E. Adams ""A different view""","[2, 5]","Ellen Burstyn in Requiem for a Dream plays the least intelligent character (Sara Goldfarb) in any movie I have ever seen where the character's lack of intelligence is not made explicitly clear to the audience or the other characters.  She inhabits a fantasy world, where it takes no more than a half a day's diet to get her refrigerator to talk to her.  She lives to watch an over the top television game show/self-improvement infomercial.  (There is no small amount of irony that there is a self-improvement message in the infomercial that is completely lost on Sara.  She is caught up in the flicker of the image on the screen and little else.)Sara complains of being old and lonely and it is touching when she does so.  That said, the primary reason for Sara's isolation is a complete lack of inner resources.  Why isn't she taking classes, or helping out a working mom with after school care or working part time in a flower shop or helping out at a homeless shelter? Why doesn't she own a dog, or a canary or a fish?  These are questions that the filmmakers don't go anywhere near.  It is unclear whether Sara is deluded into thinking that she is going to be on her favorite infomercial or not, but either way there is a conjunction of her fantasy life with her real life which is enough to send her into a delusional spiral.  Since Sara is incapable of coming up with something to aspire to on her own, when given the possibility of a dream she grasps at the weakest of straws with both hands.Jared Leto plays Sara's son Harry.  Other than being stunningly beautiful and ""loving his mother"", the Harry character has few redeeming characteristics.  Yes, he is not out and out evil, but if he is the standard for goodness, lord help us all.  He regularly steals Sara's one possession that means anything to her, her television, forcing Sara to schlep blocks and blocks in order to buy it back out of hock.  This is not presented as a joke but more of ""that's-the-way-Harry-is"" statement.  This is the first scene of the movie, confirming that Sara is in a full delusional state, denying the reality that is occurring right in front of her eyes.Jennifer Connelly (Marion) is the love interest for Jared Leto.  (She is a good match.  She is as pretty as he is.)  She appears to be a dropout bankrolled by well-to-do parents from whom she is estranged.  She lies to them about being in therapy preferring to sleeping with her skuzzy analyst for money rather than trying for some kind of reconciliation with her parents.  Rather than facing her addiction problems, she is willing to be sexually used in the most degrading manner.  While such things unfortunately do happen, we don't get much of a sense that this sinking in squalor is much of a struggle for her.  She goes down the tubes with barely a bubble of protest.And finally there is Tyrone, Harry's friend.  But Tyrone is black, so we don't get much of a sense of his story and his struggles (if any).  We do know he once had a sweet relationship with a loving mother and has a sexy girl friend who he'd rather ignore to do drugs than mess around with.Requiem for a Dream is designed to provoke strong reactions either positive or negative.  The drug scenes are graphic and strong as are the scenes of Ellen Burstyn's breakdown and Jennifer Connelly's degradation.  The problem with the film is that the aspirations of the characters are shallow.  It is hard to imagine these characters without drugs.  It is a sad and pathetic thing when one winds up agreeing with characters that drugs give their lives meaning.",3,Requiem for a fantasy is more accurate,1014336000,"02 22, 2002",2002,3571,"['Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'least', 'intelligent', 'character', 'Sara', 'Goldfarb', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'where', 'character', 'lack', 'intelligence', 'not', 'made', 'explicitly', 'clear', 'audience', 'other', 'characters', 'fantasy', 'world', 'where', 'more', 'half', 'day', 'diet', 'get', 'refrigerator', 'talk', 'watch', 'top', 'television', 'game', 'show/self-improvement', 'infomercial', 'small', 'amount', 'irony', 'self-improvement', 'message', 'infomercial', 'completely', 'lost', 'Sara', 'caught', 'up', 'flicker', 'image', 'screen', 'little', 'else', 'Sara', 'complains', 'being', 'old', 'lonely', 'touching', 'when', 'so', 'said', 'primary', 'reason', 'Sara', 'isolation', 'complete', 'lack', 'inner', 'resources', 'Why', ""n't"", 'taking', 'classes', 'helping', 'out', 'working', 'mom', 'school', 'care', 'working', 'part', 'time', 'flower', 'shop', 'helping', 'out', 'homeless', 'shelter', 'Why', ""n't"", 'own', 'dog', 'canary', 'fish', 'are', 'questions', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'near', 'unclear', 'Sara', 'deluded', 'thinking', 'going', 'be', 'favorite', 'infomercial', 'not', 'way', 'conjunction', 'fantasy', 'life', 'real', 'life', 'enough', 'send', 'delusional', 'spiral', 'Sara', 'incapable', 'coming', 'up', 'something', 'aspire', 'own', 'when', 'given', 'possibility', 'dream', 'weakest', 'straws', 'hands.Jared', 'Leto', 'Sara', 'son', 'Harry', 'Other', 'being', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'loving', 'mother', 'Harry', 'character', 'few', 'redeeming', 'characteristics', 'Yes', 'not', 'out', 'evil', 'standard', 'goodness', 'lord', 'help', 'regularly', 'Sara', 'one', 'possession', 'anything', 'television', 'forcing', 'Sara', 'schlep', 'blocks', 'blocks', 'order', 'buy', 'back', 'hock', 'not', 'presented', 'joke', 'more', ""that's-the-way-Harry-is"", 'statement', 'first', 'scene', 'movie', 'confirming', 'Sara', 'full', 'delusional', 'state', 'denying', 'reality', 'occurring', 'right', 'front', 'eyes.Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Marion', 'love', 'interest', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'good', 'match', 'as', 'pretty', 'be', 'dropout', 'bankrolled', 'well-to-do', 'parents', 'whom', 'estranged', 'being', 'therapy', 'preferring', 'sleeping', 'skuzzy', 'analyst', 'money', 'rather', 'trying', 'kind', 'reconciliation', 'parents', 'Rather', 'facing', 'addiction', 'problems', 'willing', 'be', 'sexually', 'used', 'most', 'degrading', 'manner', 'such', 'things', 'unfortunately', 'do', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'sense', 'sinking', 'squalor', 'much', 'struggle', 'down', 'tubes', 'barely', 'bubble', 'protest.And', 'finally', 'Tyrone', 'Harry', 'friend', 'Tyrone', 'black', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'sense', 'story', 'struggles', 'do', 'know', 'once', 'had', 'sweet', 'relationship', 'loving', 'mother', 'sexy', 'girl', 'friend', 'who', ""'d"", 'rather', 'ignore', 'do', 'drugs', 'mess', 'with.Requiem', 'Dream', 'designed', 'provoke', 'strong', 'reactions', 'positive', 'negative', 'drug', 'scenes', 'are', 'graphic', 'strong', 'are', 'scenes', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'breakdown', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'degradation', 'problem', 'film', 'aspirations', 'characters', 'are', 'shallow', 'hard', 'imagine', 'characters', 'drugs', 'sad', 'pathetic', 'thing', 'when', 'one', 'up', 'agreeing', 'characters', 'drugs', 'give', 'lives', 'meaning']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

Some say that Requiem is nothing more then an overrated NC-17 (or R) rated after school special about drugs. In some ways, yes it is that. Some say that it's a masterpiece adapted from a masterpiece. In some ways it's that. I personally feel that it is one of the most powerful films to come out in recent years. Aronofsky has crafted this film so well that you feel for these characters. This is not a movie that you go into hoping to see big explosions and gunfights and other elements it seems to take to have a box office sucess. This is a film that grabs your heart and rips it out. How can you not feel for Ellen Burnstyn's oscar winning performance as Sara?(*note* I don't acknowlege Julia Roberts as the oscar winner.) She could be your mother or even grandmother. True, Jared Leto's Harry isn't completely fleshed out as much as some would hope, but it doesn't matter, Leto's acting ability makes up for the lack of character. The same holds true with Marlon Wayans. When I first heard that Wayans was in it, I was skeptical. I really don't like anything he's starred in. But when I saw his performance, my jaw hit the floor. HE CAN ACT!! Not only that, HE CAN ACT VERY WELL!!! It's a shame that he doesn't do these type of films more often. Finally, Jennifer Connelly's Marion....my God, her fate is possible the second most depressing in the film (of course, Burnstyn's character has the worst fate in my opinion.) Should you see it? Yes. Will you like it? I'm not sure. Does it deserve to be a classic? Yes. Yes.

But, no matter what, they still maintain that happiness because they have nothing else to hold onto. They all still cling onto it even though their lives are thrown into a fiery downfall.Darren Aronofsky has made one of the best films of the 90's. He hits you hard with his sensory-based direction. He makes you react to what is being shown on the screen with a gut thudding motion that would make the strongest man cry. He has mastered the art of showing people that are all good then sends their lives into a tumbling downfall. His direction is wild and all over the place, and he does the direction with such an artistry that you can't help but merzmerized by what is going on the screen.Delusions of Grandour come to mind when we look at these characters. We feel some sort of pain when we watch these characters go ahead and form a niche in making their life worse until the point where they cannot turn back and realize all of the mistakes that they are making. It self induces pity from us towards the characters. We feel things when we watch the film.We don't even realize what we are watching till the end when we tell ourselves how we like this film.In my personal opinon, I was watching a mastery of filmaking. I formed that we all have our own dreams and reality that we hold onto no matter how much pain, torment, trouble or feeling that we have towards our life, we hold onto the dream no matter what.

There is little joy in the story itself, as it deals with very adult themes of drug addiction, victimization and unpleasant characters.  However, if you give it a chance, it will blow you away with its sheer velocity and transformative power.  A nightmare one moment, a walk on the beach the next, its hypnotic and never dull.  Plus - it has one of the most remarkable performances by a female actor in the past 20 years in Ellen Burstyn's fierce portrayal of an addicted mother.  Nominated for an Academy Award, Burstyn lost to the ever-popular Julia Roberts last year, but deserves to be hailed as a landmark role...perhaps even a signature role (for sheer drama, this beats her Oscar winning ""Alice Doesn;t Live Here Anymore"" as well as her up-until-now greatest accomplishment as Regan's mother in ""The Exorcist.""

530990,A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2,B00003CXP1,Josh Hitchens,"[11, 15]","I don't think that there has ever been a film as bleakly harrowing or as brave as Darren Aronofsky's &quot;Requiem for a Dream.&quot; The film deserved to win a dozen Oscars, including Ellen Burstyn for Best Actress. What makes this film different from other movies about drug addiction is that it never offers a moral view. It tells the story of four addicts living in Brooklyn who we see spiral with unstoppable momentum down into drug addiction hell over the seasons of one year.You feel for all of these characters, but the one you will pity most is Sara Goldfarb, a lonely widow played brilliantly by Ellen Burstyn. Sara hangs on to the pathetic dream of being on her favorite TV game show and losing weight to fit into her beloved red dress. Enter the diet pills. The scene where Sara explains to her son Harry (Jared Leto) that she &quot;likes the way&quot; she feels now. &quot;Now, I smile,&quot; she says. You get the feeling that Sara is teetering on the edge of madness, and more heartbreaking, she is aware of it. Her later scenes tear you apart as she plunges straight down into insanity, with no hope of ever coming back, because she doesn't want to come back.Jared Leto delivers another outstanding performance as Harry Goldfarb, Sara's heroin addict son. Harry really wants his mother to be happy, and when he learns that she is addicted to speed, he breaks down and sobs on the way home. But a shot of heroin makes him all right again. He and best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans-who is very very good) decide to start dealing heroin themselves, but the scheme goes horribly wrong. Also very affecting is Jennifer Connelly as Harry's girlfriend Marion, who will do anything for her next fix, including prostituting herself. Harry even sends her out with a man when he knows that she will have to have sex with him to get much needed cash. This is the wedge that drives them apart, only reconciling when it is too late for both of them.This is all seen with an unflinching eye, holding nothing back. Darren Aronofsky's highly effective visual style pays off in the powerful punch of the final montage of scenes which shows the fate of the four characters we feel for so deeply. The music jars us to attention as Sara undergoes electro-shock therapy, Harry's infected arm is amputated, Tyrone tries to drift to sleep in prison, and as Marion willingly suffers sexual degradation. The final images show Tyrone dreaming of his mother, Harry sobbing that Marion will never come see him, Sara lost in insanity, and Marion emotionlessly cradling a packet of coke. These four people, now without dreams, now without souls, curl up into fetal positions and sleep. The last clip shows Sara and Harry on the game show, and we see the look of crazed fear and sadness in Sara's lost eyes.&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is the most powerful film I have ever seen. It takes a second viewing to catch all of its subtleties, notable the two women who told Sara about diet pills visiting a now cadaverus Sara in the hospital. If you can bear it, you will be changed forever by this sorrowful and realistic vision of four victims of addiction.

530993,A2NBOL825B93OM,B00003CXP1,J R Zullo,"[7, 8]","""Requiem for a dream"" has two separate stories, yet connected through family ties and drug-abuse.The first story is about Sara (Ellen Burstyn, the same from ""The exorcist"", if you can believe it). Sara is a middle-aged woman, overweight, addicted to watching television. When she receives a phone call telling her she will be on some TV show, it's the moment of her life. She has a red dress that she hasn't worn in some time and she can't wear it again because of her weight problem. So, she sees a doctor that tells her to take some pills instead of taking meals. Soon she is addicted and obcessed to the pills, and her life goes down the drain.The second story is about Sara's son, Harry (Jared Leto, from ""My so-called life"" and ""Panic room""), his girlfriend, played by Jennifer Connely (before ""A beautiful mind"") and his friend played by Marlon Wayans. The lives of these three characters are already down the drain, because they're heroine addicts, and everything they do is in order to get more of the stuff.All four mentioned actors have impressive performances. Ellen Burstyn's transformation during the film is amazing. Her performance won her nominations for both the Academy and Golden GLobe awards (and she lost to Julia Roberts, proving that what wins these prizes is lobbying, not acting). Jared Leto is also very good, but he doesn't change much from the introspective and  quiet characters he is used to play. Marlon Wayans surprised me doing a serious character, also very good. But Jennifer Connelly's performance, in my opinion, was the strongest. For once, she put aside her good looks and concentrated in doing a drug addict, sometimes ugly, desperate, puffy face, running nose, etc.Before watching the movie, I saw an interview with the director, Aronofsky, saying he wanted to provide the viewers with an emotional roller-coaster. There is no roller coaster in the movie, it's all plainly downhill from beginning to end. I found  interesting some of the technics used by the director, like using mostly closed sets (specially towards the end), showing the prison-like life the characters were going into; and the camera attached to the actors' bodies, closing on their faces, was also different from what I'm used to watching in movies.The title is perfect for this movie.

The photography, the editing, the acting, all superb. In that sense, the DVD is great becuz some of those extras? about filming and writing? are more interesting than the film itself. But storywise, major disappointment Hubert--just one or two scenes dragged out to fill an hour and a half, beating and beating the same campy message as that movie, Reefer Madness I mean, it's filmed much more stylishly than that, you know, but you see what I mean. And what's the deal with that soundtrack, that weird ominous music? Hubert, really. Do drug addicts hear string quartets in their heads all day? Whatareya trying to make here? A horror movie? With an old lady taking speed from her doctor, and talking to the TV? It has such a great, poetical title. I really expected, given the fact that so many successful people are addicted to these very drugs, you'd try to show how addiction destroys the pursuit of dreams. I mean, with a title like that...But these characters, they had no real dreams to pursue. They did nothing at all with themselves all day. Nothing, Hubert! Nothing! Not to mention that they were bone-chillingly stupid. Don't get me wrong--Ellen Burstyn was great. It's just that given the amount of speed she was taking over just a few months, it doesn't make sense, what she does. Do you actually know anyone who has taken speed for a few months? And the girl who becomes a whore - puleez. Girls who look like her have much better options when they decide to be a drug whore. Hubert, you were just trying to make a splash. Admit it. You were just trying to make us scared. But you made me laugh, Hubert. You really did. This sh** really sells, you were right. You don't even have to know what you're talking about.

531006,A1XXBVRRNGBG5Y,B00003CXP1,kendall lopere,"[11, 27]","Requiem for a Dream is an interesting and enjoyable diversion that ultimately has little to say. The movie is best read as a chronicle  of the slide into addiction of 4 connected, sane, likeable, fully functional individuals that regularily use drugs.  Whether or not anyone involved in the production of the movie has ever used drugs is open to debate.  In many ways in fact the movie might have been funded by the Government's ""War on Drugs"".  There is no redemption here.  Everyone who uses drugs is destroyed by them.  Several key arguments of the anti-drug lobby are played out here.  Watch the ""Gateway Drug Theory"" in action, as all the addicts begin to consume more and harder drugs! Watch the ""Decline in Societies morals"" as the rich daddy's girl who could be YOUR daughter becomes a [hooker], allowing her body to be graphically defiled in all sorts of ways to fund her cravings. However, this kind of moralizing and patronizing approach ends up being rather heavy-handed - half way through the movie I wanted to scream out ""OK! Drugs are bad!!  We get it!!! Now work on the plot!!!!"". Sadly there is no feedback here, and we continue to be hit on the head with the anti-drug message until the film thankfully ends.That's not to say it's a bad movie - the plot thread involving the mother is the highlight of the piece, making a very important point that legal drugs can be as addicitive and destructive as illegal ones, the mother-son relationship must strike a chord with anyone who has parents, and the tale of the doomed lovers could be as Shakespearean as the title suggests.The editing of the movie leaves something to be desired, as this movie could be a textbook case of the dangers of using gimmicks for gimmicks sake.  The worst abuse of this is when the director decides to use a split screen approach to fully capture the scene when 2 people are having a conversation in the same room, a few meters from each other.  It's pointless, it adds nothing and it detracts from the on-screen drama....To conclude, if you want a movie to scare you off drugs, but that actually has a plot and is entertaining and hilarious too, watch ""Trainspotting"" or ""Spun"" instead.",3,Coney Island Freak Show...,1062115200,"08 29, 2003",2003,2181,"['Requiem', 'Dream', 'interesting', 'enjoyable', 'diversion', 'ultimately', 'little', 'say', 'movie', 'best', 'read', 'chronicle', 'slide', 'addiction', '4', 'connected', 'sane', 'likeable', 'fully', 'functional', 'individuals', 'regularily', 'use', 'drugs', 'Whether', 'not', 'anyone', 'involved', 'production', 'movie', 'ever', 'used', 'drugs', 'open', 'debate', 'many', 'ways', 'fact', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'funded', 'Government', 'War', 'Drugs', 'redemption', 'here', 'Everyone', 'who', 'drugs', 'destroyed', 'Several', 'key', 'arguments', 'anti-drug', 'lobby', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'here', 'Watch', 'Gateway', 'Drug', 'Theory', 'action', 'addicts', 'begin', 'consume', 'more', 'harder', 'drugs', 'Watch', 'Decline', 'Societies', 'morals', 'rich', 'daddy', 'girl', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'YOUR', 'daughter', '[', 'hooker', ']', 'allowing', 'body', 'be', 'graphically', 'defiled', 'sorts', 'ways', 'fund', 'cravings', 'However', 'kind', 'moralizing', 'patronizing', 'approach', 'up', 'being', 'rather', 'heavy-handed', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'wanted', 'scream', 'out', 'OK', 'Drugs', 'are', 'bad', 'get', 'Now', 'work', 'plot', 'Sadly', 'feedback', 'here', 'continue', 'be', 'hit', 'head', 'anti-drug', 'message', 'film', 'thankfully', 'ends.That', 'not', 'say', 'bad', 'movie', 'plot', 'thread', 'involving', 'mother', 'highlight', 'piece', 'making', 'very', 'important', 'point', 'legal', 'drugs', 'can', 'be', 'addicitive', 'destructive', 'illegal', 'ones', 'mother-son', 'relationship', 'must', 'strike', 'chord', 'anyone', 'who', 'parents', 'tale', 'doomed', 'lovers', 'could', 'be', 'as', 'Shakespearean', 'title', 'suggests.The', 'editing', 'movie', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'textbook', 'case', 'dangers', 'using', 'gimmicks', 'gimmicks', 'sake', 'worst', 'abuse', 'when', 'director', 'use', 'split', 'screen', 'approach', 'fully', 'capture', 'scene', 'when', '2', 'people', 'are', 'having', 'conversation', 'same', 'room', 'few', 'meters', 'other', 'pointless', 'nothing', 'on-screen', 'drama', '.To', 'conclude', 'want', 'movie', 'scare', 'off', 'drugs', 'actually', 'plot', 'entertaining', 'hilarious', 'too', 'watch', 'Trainspotting', 'Spun', 'instead']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

Each of these people have their own visions of happiness that begins innocently enough in their minds the way hopes, wishes, and dreams do in all of us--little ""what if""s and ""It'd sure be nice to""s that usually die on the back burner where they were born.But in this movie, other factors come in that cruelly give this quartet the opportunity (some would say excuse) to pursue these dreams to the point where they become an unhealthy obsession from which there is no escape, only a temporary release from the pain by plunging further into their dreams, which by the film's ending, have mothered their own personal nightmares.Many people who reviewed this movie have made the error of stating that this is an anti-drug movie.  While the connection is more than apparent in the film (all four characters are putting some kind of drug into their bodies) the real core message and point of the film is how addiction in general, to anything, had the ability and strength to overwhelm and subvert the human spirit.  Take for example, movies.Going to the movies (or watching one at home) is a great way to ""get away"" from life for a while and momentarily forget about the things that make up the darker threads of the human tapestry.  The problem arises, when one enjoys the escapist quotient of movies to the point where all other activites that make up real life are eschewed in favor of this quick fix.  The same statement can be made about drugs, alcohol, video games, etc.The real tragedy in the movie is that all four characters flat-out admit that their willpower and perserverance have succumbed to their addictions.  The most memorable is the pivotal scene at the end of the first act, when Sara, who has been told that she will appear on television, talks to Harry about the diet pills she's been taking so she can fit back into the red dress she had worn at Harry's graduation.  Sara is no road scholar, so she is unaware what the diet pills could do to her if she ever overdoses, but she loves the feeling that she gets when she takes them.  She never overtly admits that her taking the pills makes her happy, but that is the real truth she hides from herself.  She doesn't want to stop taking them because the feeling she gets from them is better than life the way it was before she was perscribed them:  boring, widowed, lonely Sara, sitting in front of the TV and nursing her box of chocolates.The movie is not about drugs.  It is about addiction, and it shows us what addiction does to people with the stark honesty and brutality that no high school class or parental seminar or psychology professor could ever have hoped to achieve.",5,The Triumph of Addiction,1039824000,"12 14, 2002",2002,3185,"['movie', 'one', 'rarely-made', 'movies', 'have', 'created', 'paradigm', 'shift', 'day-to-day', 'operations.Filmmaker', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'writings', 'Hubert', 'Selby', 'Jr.', 'create', 'lasting', 'image', 'destructive', 'effects', 'addiction', 'human', 'body', 'spirit', 'one', 'gest', 'skin', 'stays', 'you.The', 'movie', 'lives', 'four', 'connected', 'characters', 'Sara', 'Goldfarb', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'son', 'Harry', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'girlfriend', 'Marion', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Harry', 'best', 'friend', 'Tyrone', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'people', 'have', 'own', 'visions', 'happiness', 'innocently', 'enough', 'minds', 'way', 'wishes', 'dreams', 'do', 'little', 'what', 's', ""'d"", 'sure', 'be', 'nice', 's', 'usually', 'die', 'back', 'burner', 'where', 'were', 'born.But', 'movie', 'other', 'factors', 'come', 'cruelly', 'give', 'quartet', 'opportunity', 'would', 'say', 'excuse', 'pursue', 'dreams', 'point', 'where', 'become', 'unhealthy', 'obsession', 'escape', 'only', 'temporary', 'release', 'pain', 'plunging', 'further', 'dreams', 'film', 'ending', 'have', 'mothered', 'own', 'personal', 'nightmares.Many', 'people', 'who', 'reviewed', 'movie', 'have', 'made', 'error', 'stating', 'anti-drug', 'movie', 'connection', 'more', 'apparent', 'film', 'four', 'characters', 'are', 'putting', 'kind', 'drug', 'bodies', 'real', 'core', 'message', 'point', 'film', 'how', 'addiction', 'general', 'anything', 'had', 'ability', 'strength', 'overwhelm', 'subvert', 'human', 'spirit', 'Take', 'example', 'movies.Going', 'movies', 'watching', 'one', 'home', 'great', 'way', 'get', 'away', 'life', 'while', 'momentarily', 'forget', 'things', 'make', 'up', 'darker', 'threads', 'human', 'tapestry', 'problem', 'arises', 'when', 'one', 'escapist', 'quotient', 'movies', 'point', 'where', 'other', 'activites', 'make', 'up', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'eschewed', 'favor', 'quick', 'fix', 'same', 'statement', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'video', 'games', 'etc.The', 'real', 'tragedy', 'movie', 'four', 'characters', 'flat-out', 'admit', 'willpower', 'perserverance', 'have', 'succumbed', 'addictions', 'most', 'memorable', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'end', 'first', 'act', 'when', 'Sara', 'who', 'been', 'told', 'will', 'appear', 'television', 'talks', 'Harry', 'diet', 'been', 'taking', 'can', 'fit', 'back', 'red', 'dress', 'had', 'worn', 'Harry', 'graduation', 'Sara', 'road', 'scholar', 'unaware', 'what', 'diet', 'pills', 'could', 'do', 'her', 'ever', 'feeling', 'when', 'never', 'overtly', 'taking', 'pills', 'happy', 'real', 'truth', 'herself', ""n't"", 'want', 'stop', 'taking', 'feeling', 'better', 'life', 'way', 'was', 'was', 'perscribed', 'boring', 'widowed', 'lonely', 'Sara', 'sitting', 'front', 'TV', 'nursing', 'box', 'chocolates.The', 'movie', 'not', 'drugs', 'addiction', 'what', 'addiction', 'people', 'stark', 'honesty', 'brutality', 'high', 'school', 'class', 'parental', 'seminar', 'psychology', 'professor', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'hoped', 'achieve']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

Gittins,"[2, 2]","""Requiem For A Dream"" is director Darren Aronofsky's second movie, based on the book by Hubert Selby, following his powerful black-and-white ""Pi"". Starring Ellen Burstyn (oscar-nominated for her role), Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans in the top 4 roles, plus Sean Gulette, Mark Margolis, Samia Shoaib, and Ajay Naidu from ""Pi"" in minor roles. The score is by Clint Mansell, who also scored ""Pi"".Darren Aronofsky expands his unusual visual style to include split-screens, stop motion or sped-up motion sequences, extreme close-ups and wide angles.The movie starts with the son Harry (Leto) taking mom Sara's (Burstyn) TV to pawn for drug money. Shortly after, mom gets a phone call telling her that she has been selected to appear on a TV show in the near future. She anticipates her appearance on the TV and finds she can't fit into her old red dress. She tries some diets, such as a hard-boiled egg and grapefruit, then goes to a quack doctor for diet pills - purple in the morning, blue in the afternoon, orange in the evening, green at night. She eventually loses it and ultimately lands up in the hospital.Jennifer Connelly is Harry's girlfriend Marion, a fashion designer. As a result of Harry and Marion's heroin addiction, Marion performs more and more sex with other people for drugs or drug money.Harry and his friend, Tyrone (Wayans) spend most of the movie buying or trying to buy drugs, and getting high. They eventually plan to buy a large quantity to re-sell it to get a share for free. Ultimately, after driving toward Florida for a drug buy, Harry ends up in the hospital with an infected arm, and Tyrone gets put in jail.In a fantasy, mom and son finally appear on the ""Tappy Timmons"" self-help show.The reasonably-priced DVD has a commentary by director Aronofsky, a commentary by the cinematographer, a behind-the-scenes documentary, and some other goodies. Unrated director's cut, which is currently #51 on the IMDB top-movie list, has scenes of constant drug use, strong language, and explicit sex.

Two hours later, I knew WHY I couldn't see it alone and was racked with nightmares for weeks afterward.&quot;Requiem For A Dream&quot; is the second film by indie-auteur Darren Aronofsky, former Brooklyn native and Harvard dropout.  Good thing he screwed up at Harvard or this film would never have been made.  After reading Hubert Selby's &quot;almost as disturbing&quot; 1964 novel &quot;Last Exit To Brooklyn,&quot; he discovered this book, the story of four formerly everyday innocents sucked into and trapped by a downward spiral into a place with which hell could never compete.  The odd part is that he never finished it.  It disturbed him too much.  I can identify with that.The visuals that encompass this film are so stunning, so frightening, so spastically violent and cruel that you may find yourself hiding behind the nearest large object to avoid the wrath of what leaps out of the screen and assaults you with all its might.  The Kronos Quartet, who provides the disturbingly beautiful soundtrack, plays with a continued intensity through the entire film up to including its vicious finale.  In addition to the cinematography and score, though, are four actors that easily make this film one of the top ten of the last ten years.  Hands down.  No questions asked.Ellen Burstyn's performance in this movie was easily one of the most heart-wrenching, dynamic sucker-punches in a VERY long time.  To watch this sweet old woman, Sara Goldfarb, descend into loneliness and drug addiction will easily bring you to tears, particularly at its finale.  Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans cause you to do a double-take as the best friends, Harry and Tyrone, who go into business for themselves only to find themselves worse off than they ever were before (to say it mildly).  They both take off into directions they have never previously achieved.  And Jennifer Connelly's artistic sweetheart-turned-whore is nearly as worthy of Oscar praise as her co-star Burstyn is.  I can't imagine any of them will ever have better performances in their lifetime.To say this is an excellent movie is an understatement.  To say it is graphic in terms of its violence, sexuality and drug use is also an understatement.  Be prepared to have the images of their hell swimming through your mind with every moment of the weeks ahead.

The more I read about this movie and learned about it, the more fascinating it seemed. I also am one of those people who, when they hear a movie is extremely shocking and disturbing, get a burning urge to see it as fast as I can to see if it shocks me (especially if it's unrated or NC-17), since I am pretty jaded. So, I eagerly anticipated seeing it.The plot concerns four addicts. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly play a young loving couple, Harry and Marion, who dabble in heroin and plan to make a big sale along with their friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) so they can be set for life and Marion can open up her own (legal) business. Unfortunately, their recreational drug use turns into day-to-day addiction, and things start to get ugly. REAL ugly. (Watching someone shoot up directly into a gangrene-infected, pus-filled crater in his arm kind of gave me a whole new definition of the word ugly.) Ellen Burstyn plays Harry's mother Sarah, a lonely widow who wants to lose weight to fit into a red dress so she can appear on her favorite TV show. She starts out by being addicted to TV and candy, but has the bad luck to go to a doctor who-in what I thought was the only unrealistic part of the film- gives her an RX for 'diet pills', that turn out to actually be speed. I say unrealistic because, as anyone who has ever worked in the medical profession knows, very few doctors will NOT just write someone who goes to them for the first time to see them for weight loss a huge prescription for extremely powerful and addictive controlled substances without so much as an examination. If the movie took place any time before the early 80's, this would have been a little easier to swallow.Anyway, I found her story thread the most memorable and heartbreaking. Sarah takes pills and starts losing weight, as well as suddenly becoming very energetic and chatty. Like any addictive drug, her happy blue pills stop working after prolonged use so she ups her dose more...and more...and things slowly start getting very weird and scary. In one of the best scenes midway through the film (one of the few that had a tiny bit of comic relief) Harry visits her --the only visit he makes during the movie where he doesn't openly steal her TV to pawn for dope money.  He is briefly riding high (in more ways than one) and tells her he bought her a big screen TV-he wanted to do something nice for her and figured out that &quot;TV is her fix&quot;. He looks like he's getting a bad feeling when she's babbling happily about how she has a reason to get up in the morning, and then he hears her grinding her teeth, and figures it out. This is the first time in the movie you see real fear in his eyes. Sarah soon starts having very scary strung-out hallucinations-starting out with subtle things like time woozily slowing down and speeding back up, and when her refrigerator suddenly starts moving on its own, the real nightmare begins. An agressive fridge with a mind of its own sounds Monty Python-esque when you first hear about it, but trust me, you won't be laughing by the end of the movie.One review I read said that the movie not only pulls the rug out from under you, it drags you and the rug down a long flight of stairs into a very dark basement. Another reviewer compared the experience of watching the film to a drug, and that's not too far off the mark either. Whenever a character gets high, there's a slam-bang fast cut montage of the same images over and over; a sigh, a pupil dilating, cells changing color. The scenes where Sarah hallucinates are pretty close to the real thing. The description I probably agree with most came from Darren Aronofsky himself-he compared the film to a jump from a plane without a parachute, and the movie ends three minutes after you hit the ground. The last few minutes that show the gruesome, depressing, worst-case-scenario fates of all 4 characters are just as intense, hard to watch, and nightmarish as I heard they were. I don't think I will ever forget Harry's mother's transformation from a harmless, plump, friendly older woman to someone so frightening looking that people cringe away in fear and revulsion at the sight of her.My only complaints would be that I wish it were longer, with more time for character development.  I would have liked more scenes of what these people and their lives were like before they were addicts, as well as their relationships with each other. The cast is great- Wayans shows that he has the most range and talent of the Wayans bros- I laughed so hard at him in Don't Be A Menace that I ended up buying it, but here...wow. I would have liked to see more of his character. I never liked Leto much before, but he is excellent and also almost unrecognizable  (he said he dropped 1/5 of his weight for the role and boy does it show). Connelly I disliked so much before that I would actively avoid seeing movies she was in, but I was very impressed and convinced that she can act. Burstyn gives the performance of a lifetime- not only convincing, but she was dedicated enough to let the filmmakers make her look like absolute and total hell, which many actresses over 50 would probably not be brave enough to do.Not recommended if you're easily shocked, squeamish, or upset. If you only like movies that take you to a happy place, stay away. Everyone who left the movie theater looked like they had just been hit over the head with a very large board.  And we were all people who knew what we were getting into. Recommended for those who want to see a movie that will completely overtake you and involve you emotionally. In addition, this film should be required viewing for everyone in the fashion industry that supported and glorified that whole 'heroin chic' crap.

531017,A136MAOWGCU2C2,B00003CXP1,K.T. May,"[3, 4]","It's not too often that I give a movie the full ""ten out of ten"" stars that a website like IMDB will allow you to rate a movie, but I just recently had the pleasure of viewing Requiem For a Dream and all I can say is, wow.  I know I say this often, but this is a film that will stay with you for a very long time.  Many critics say it is a film about drug addiction, but those of us who adore the film on a much deeper level can tell you that it is certainly about much more than that.This 2000 film, (released on DVD in 2001 and directed by Darren Aronofsky of Black Swan and The Fighter) stars Jared Leto (Fight Club), Ellen Burstyn (The Fountain), Marlon Wayans (Scary Movie) and Jennifer Connelly (A Beautiful Mind), is based on the novel by Hubert Selby, Jr., and is a fantastic character study that deeply explores how quickly things can unravel when people want things so desperately, they'll do anything to get them.Leto stars as Harry Goldfarb, the son to Burstyn's Sara, who is in love with the beautiful Marion (Connelly), an aspiring fashion designer.  Wayans is Tyrone, Harry's best friend who, along with Harry, tries to pursue a better life through the ill-conceived idea of ""the big score"", i.e. that one drug deal that will allow the dreams of this threesome to flourish, possibly affording them the luxury of leaving their Coney Island homes behind.While the events that play out in the lives of the younger three are tragic enough as the movie unfolds, it is Sara's story that, when pinned up next to the tales of the other three, add an extra dimension of weight to some already pretty weighty material.  Sara is, arguably, the character for whom most people's hearts break the hardest.  She receives a phone call that she is chosen as a guest to be on her favorite infomercial.  She sees this as a reason to live and begins to take ""diet pills"" to help her fit back into the dress she wore at Harry's graduation, the one her late husband loved so much.I won't lie to you--this movie ends in what is far from a happy ending, which makes it much more realistic and hard-hitting than most films you will watch in your lifetime.  The performances from each of the principal cast members are heart-breaking and true-to-life in their own right.  Not to mention, the score composed by Clint Mansell and performed by the Kronos Quartet will earworm its way into your mind and lay eggs there for days.  Per the Wikipedia page for the film, the pieces here are notable in that they are quite adept at making normally softer sounding instruments sound more cold, harsh and uninviting.Words cannot do this film justice.  What can, however, are the 2,000 cut scenes (in a movie that would normally receive the treatment of between 500-600), the fool-proof and gut-wrenching performances, the haunting score, the heartbreaking plot and the power of the hold this movie will take on you and not free you for weeks afterward.  If you want to see as many quality films in your lifetime as you can, seriouslly, add Requiem For a Dream to your list.",5,10 Years Later...,1296604800,"02 2, 2011",2011,3051,"['not', 'too', 'often', 'give', 'movie', 'full', 'ten', 'ten', 'stars', 'website', 'IMDB', 'will', 'allow', 'rate', 'movie', 'just', 'recently', 'had', 'pleasure', 'viewing', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'can', 'say', 'wow', 'know', 'say', 'often', 'film', 'will', 'stay', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Many', 'critics', 'say', 'film', 'drug', 'addiction', 'who', 'adore', 'film', 'much', 'deeper', 'level', 'can', 'tell', 'certainly', 'about', 'much', 'more', 'that.This', '2000', 'film', 'released', 'DVD', '2001', 'directed', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'Black', 'Swan', 'Fighter', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Fountain', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'based', 'novel', 'Hubert', 'Selby', 'Jr.', 'fantastic', 'character', 'study', 'deeply', 'how', 'quickly', 'things', 'can', 'unravel', 'when', 'people', 'want', 'things', 'so', 'desperately', ""'ll"", 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'them.Leto', 'stars', 'Harry', 'Goldfarb', 'son', 'Burstyn', 'Sara', 'who', 'love', 'beautiful', 'Marion', 'Connelly', 'aspiring', 'fashion', 'designer', 'Wayans', 'Tyrone', 'Harry', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'Harry', 'pursue', 'better', 'life', 'ill-conceived', 'idea', 'big', 'score', 'i.e', 'one', 'drug', 'deal', 'will', 'allow', 'dreams', 'threesome', 'flourish', 'possibly', 'affording', 'luxury', 'leaving', 'Coney', 'Island', 'homes', 'behind.While', 'events', 'play', 'out', 'lives', 'younger', 'three', 'are', 'tragic', 'enough', 'movie', 'Sara', 'story', 'when', 'pinned', 'up', 'next', 'tales', 'other', 'three', 'add', 'extra', 'dimension', 'weight', 'already', 'pretty', 'weighty', 'material', 'Sara', 'arguably', 'character', 'whom', 'most', 'people', 'hearts', 'break', 'hardest', 'phone', 'call', 'chosen', 'guest', 'be', 'favorite', 'infomercial', 'reason', 'live', 'take', 'diet', 'pills', 'help', 'fit', 'back', 'dress', 'wore', 'Harry', 'graduation', 'one', 'late', 'husband', 'loved', 'so', 'much.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lie', 'movie', 'what', 'far', 'happy', 'ending', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'hard-hitting', 'most', 'films', 'will', 'watch', 'lifetime', 'performances', 'principal', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'heart-breaking', 'true-to-life', 'own', 'right', 'Not', 'mention', 'score', 'composed', 'Clint', 'Mansell', 'performed', 'Kronos', 'Quartet', 'will', 'earworm', 'way', 'mind', 'lay', 'eggs', 'there', 'days', 'Wikipedia', 'page', 'film', 'pieces', 'here', 'are', 'notable', 'are', 'quite', 'adept', 'making', 'normally', 'softer', 'sounding', 'instruments', 'sound', 'more', 'cold', 'harsh', 'uninviting.Words', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'film', 'justice', 'What', 'can', 'however', 'are', '2,000', 'cut', 'scenes', 'movie', 'would', 'normally', 'receive', 'treatment', '500-600', 'fool-proof', 'gut-wrenching', 'performances', 'haunting', 'score', 'heartbreaking', 'plot', 'power', 'hold', 'movie', 'will', 'take', 'not', 'free', 'weeks', 'afterward', 'want', 'see', 'many', 'quality', 'films', 'lifetime', 'can', 'seriouslly', 'add', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'list']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

All four characters start out bright and normal, but slowly sink into a world consumed by drugs (namely heroin).Yet what brought this film down for me was how it lost its way towards the end. The director started off brilliantly, with pieces of film that were hard-hitting and terrible, but that people could relate to. As the film progresses, we are sent whirling through a number of unnecessary camera tecnhiques and voice techniques, not to mention graphic scenes merely for effect (the cutting off of an arm etc). Yet the ending leaves us with a sense of sadness and regret, but paints a vivid picture in our minds; one of both warning and preaching. The degredatoin the characters suffer are all a means to an end for the point the direction wishes to make: please don't use heroin!To conclude, there is no doubt in my mind that this was an interesting film to watch, with great underlying meaning, excellent acting and, at times, some highly skillful directing. However, I found it hard towards the end, to engage my interest, as it just went from strange to stranger.If I could give half stars, this would be 3 and a half, but I think in conclusion it has a well earned 3 stars.

531022,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00003CXP1,Lawyeraau,"[4, 5]","This is a wonderful, dark film about drug addiction, as well as the destruction of hope. It is marvelously cast with wonderful performances by Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and Jennifer Connelly. It is Ellen Burstyn's bravura performance, however, that blows the viewer away.Burstyn plays the role of Sara Goldfarb, a lonely, middle aged widow who lives in Brooklyn and has a handsome, though heroin addicted son, Harry, affectingly played by Jared Leto. Harry spends most of his time shooting up and dealing drugs with his buddy, Tyrone, deftly played by Marlon Wayans. Harry has a pretty, well to do girlfriend, Marian, played by Jennifer Connelly, who walks on the wild side with Harry and begins her own downward spiral with drugs.Sara is in denial about how serious her son's drug habit really is. She is, in fact, the great enabler when it comes to Harry. The concept of tough love never even enters her mind. After all, Harry is all she has. For her, hope springs eternal, when it comes to her beloved Harry.Sara spends her days glued to her tv set, watching her favorite game show or talking to other lonely, middle aged women who spend their time sitting in front of the multi-unit dwelling in which they all live. Her life is limited and stark, until she one day receives a call inviting her to be a contestant on that game show she watches. It is here that her life begins to unravel, as she goes on a diet in order to fit into her favorite red dress in preparation for her possible television debut. Fueled by diet pills provided by a so called &quot;doctor&quot;, she begins to live a life that parallels that of her son.The director, Darren Aronofsky, inventively shows the viewer the experience of drug addiction in a novel way, through a montage of vivid sensory and imagery bursts that become more frequent and intense, as the drug use in the film becomes more pervasive and relentless. He takes the viewer through the personal downward spiral of each of the four main characters in the movie, as they hurl on a personal collision course fueled by each one's respective drug addiction.  It is one of the most frightening and horrifying portrayals of drug addiction ever to grace the screen. Marvelously directed and acted, this is a film to remember.

Unfortunatly, these problems occur as a result of people trying to accomplish their dreams through the use of drugs.Although the story line in this movie may appear to be slow, Aronofsky is careful not to rush to the ending that the entire movie builds up for. He allows plenty of time for the characters and their respective problems to develop, which is all presented at the perfect pace- starting as petty and getting progressively worse. The character development is something overlooked but mandatory in a movie such as this.I must give specific mention to the music too. The music is the perfect compliment to the specific scenes and really displays the attitude of the scene as well.Overall, this movie is very depressing becuase it doesnt hold anything back and is made more depressing by the fact that incidents such as these are all too common.",5,Great Movie,1144540800,"04 9, 2006",2006,932,"['Requiem', 'dream', 'amazing', 'look', 'development', 'drug', 'addictions', 'Unfortunatly', 'problems', 'occur', 'result', 'people', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'dreams', 'use', 'story', 'line', 'movie', 'may', 'appear', 'be', 'slow', 'Aronofsky', 'careful', 'not', 'rush', 'ending', 'entire', 'movie', 'up', 'plenty', 'time', 'characters', 'respective', 'problems', 'develop', 'presented', 'perfect', 'pace-', 'starting', 'petty', 'getting', 'progressively', 'worse', 'character', 'development', 'something', 'overlooked', 'mandatory', 'movie', 'such', 'this.I', 'must', 'give', 'specific', 'mention', 'music', 'too', 'music', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'specific', 'scenes', 'really', 'displays', 'attitude', 'scene', 'well.Overall', 'movie', 'very', 'depressing', 'becuase', 'hold', 'anything', 'back', 'made', 'more', 'depressing', 'fact', 'incidents', 'such', 'are', 'too', 'common']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut
531025,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00003CXP1,Linda Linguvic,"[36, 39]","This disturbing film, creatively directed by Darren Aronofsky of &quot;Pi&quot; fame is about drug addition. For Ellen Burstyn, cast in the role of Sarah Goldfarb, a lonely Brooklyn housewife who is trying to lose weight to appear on a TV show, the drug of choice is diet pills. For her son, played by Jared Leto; his girlfriend, played by Jennifer Connely; and his pal, played by Marlon Wayans, the drug is heroin. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby, Jr., who also wrote the screenplay, the setting is a run-down and sad Brooklyn neighborhood near the beach, where buildings are old, people are poor and the American dream is a far off taunting illusion. The time period is unclear because the TV set, which is the center of Sarah Goldfarb's life, is of 1950s vintage; and yet the characters all use cell phones. But these details really don't matter much. There are enough other fantasy elements in this film to hurl it into the age that created music videos.Using creative film techniques, the director has managed to bring the audience right into the mental states of the addicts. There are extreme close-ups, slow-motion and fast-motion sequences and split screen effects. We go on the fantasy trip with the characters and then we crash with the reality. We watch the effects on them as their personalities change as well as their physical appearances. The result is chilling. The script calls for outstanding acting jobs and Ellen Burstyn's work is perhaps the finest of her long career. The other actors also shine in these very challenging performances. Jared Leto is more than just a handsome young actor; Jennifer Connely, who is almost too pretty for her harrowing role, is excellent; and Marlon Wayans, who we usually see in comedies, proves here that he handle a serious part. This is not a film for the squeamish. It is deeply disturbing and sad. But the discomfort is worth it for those who are willing to explore this underbelly of a perverse American dream.

Especially after viewing 'Requiem for a Dream'. The one thing about drugs that seems to be a universally recognizable cross-cultural phenomenon, is that when one consumes their drug of choice, one is fairly well guaranteed of a predictable set of feelings. Feelings that are far preferable to those randomly and often cruelly dished up by a drug-free life. For many, many people it is easier and far preferable to die in drug hell than to encounter the seemingly bottomless pit of pain that exists in an everday mainstream life. It is no wonder that the life and death of a drug addicted soul makes better sense when viewed from the perspective of choice as presented in this film. When the character played by Ellen Burstyn defends her choice to stick with the diet pills, she makes a stunning case for that choice. Her son is sickened by what he knows will be the outcome of her consumption of those particular drugs, but he can't present a compelling argument without revealing his own scope of personal aquaintance with pharmaceuticals, etc.What it all boils down to is that by the time you are, in most cases, irretrievably sucked into the biggest lie of all for a life (that drugs will take away your pain and give you all sorts of nicer and often ecstatic feelings) you have a double whammy. You would have to go through withdrawal to get out of the addiction phase and go back to face all of those terrifying feelings that you wanted so desperately to avoid in the first place. The truly sad thing is that the terrifying feelings are a real piece of cake when stacked up against the retribution of the outside world against a drug addict.That is why this film is so important.

She was nominated for the Oscar, and booooohhh! to the Academy for passing her by. Perhaps they could not handle such pure brilliance?The story is not so unusual, and surely there are even more brutally honest films dealing with drug addiction, than this one. What is unusual, however, is  the editing, especially towards the end, when we, the hapless viewer, frustrated because we can not reach out and put an end to their suffering, watch all four protagonists get tossed from one end of Hell to the other, in short, brutal sequences, so fast and furious that we can not even keep track of what is happening.... and perhaps because it's better so because the pain and agony we are presented with is simply too realistic and impossible to bear.Yes this is a cautionary tale. What makes it stand out from among  the others is that it encompasses four different people. Director  Darren Aronofsky is outstanding. By including the mother, Ellen Burstyn, and her fast rollercoaster into Hell because of a jaded doctor who carelessly prescribes high doses of diet pills, he has enriched the plot. Though middle aged, Sarah Goldfarb has lived a secluded life and thus is an innocent, with an old-fashioned trust in the omnipotence of her doctor.Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) lives in Coney Island, and is the mother of Harry (played by Jared Leto). Sarah gets selected as a guest on her favvy TV show, which jolts her out of her apathy as a lonely widow, wishes to lose weight to look good on screen, and finds the aforementioned doctor.  Meanwhile, her son Harry, his girl friend Marian(Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend (Marlon Wayans) step into an accelerated ride into chaos.There are enough plot twists to keep you on the edge of your seat. Also, plenty callous scenes to infuriate you. Harry ends up in the hospital with a clearly life-threatening inner-arm infection from heroin usage, and the doctor, instead of treating him PRONTO, calls the police and has him tossed in jail. I am not sure if such a thing can be done in the real world, or perhaps this is just naive outrage on my part?Another amazon.com reviewer, ""Pen Name: Mr. X (NYC)"" offered a good observation on August 9, 2004: ""... this movie doesn't make the character's bad decisions equal bad outcomes, the director forces these bad outcomes onto the characters with unrealistic events. Diet pills don't produce what you will see in this movie, and they arent going to use electro shock therapy. ""Mr. X. is correct, not everyone will freak out on diet pills as Sarah Goldfarb does here, and not every drug addict takes it to the bitter end to end up in jail or in a sex-party for freakish, well-dressed, pillar of the community type of men. Yes indeed some drug addicts might encounter angels who will lift them out of Hell. But do you want to chance it?I used to be a die-hard can-do, will-do, person.

531037,A1R283L4SH4UP8,B00003CXP1,Magpie,"[4, 5]","......in my own humble opinion.Requiem For A Dream on the surface is not disturbing. It's intense and certainly shocking, but it doesn't get disturbing until you peel back the layers. Darren Aronofsky, along with David Fincher, is a director who is very aware of the material he creates his films from. The novel that this movie is based on is not about drug addicts. Let me repeat that, it is NOT about drug addicts. It is not Trainspotting. Requiem For A Dream tells you what it's about in its title. Dreams. Dreams that every single one of us have. Some of us achieve them. Some of us let them fall by the wayside and settle for something else. Then there are those of us, that are so obsessed, so ADDICTED, to our dreams, that we are in danger of destroying all the good things around us that we've created in our lives while in pursuit of this one solitary single goal. In Requiem, Harry, Tyrone, and Marion want to have the good life. They want money and success. They want to get there as soon as possible. They take short cuts to get there because the goal is taking way too long.So, what's the difference between you and them? That they shoot heroin? Are any of us addicted to cigarettes? To caffeine? To sex? To shopping, even? Anything can be a crippling addiction, anything can stand in the way of pursuing your dream without even you realizing it. You, yourself, could be standing in the way of your dream, and you might not even realize it.Sara Goldfarb wants to be thin so she can be on television. There are so many people who hate the way they look and will do anything to get the body or the face they want. Many do not have the patience or endurance for exercise. For many, exercise may not work, so they look for other methods. Sara Goldfarb is your neighbor, she's your mom, your sister, the woman who served you your coffee at your local coffee shop today.People are too quick to write this movie off, even those that love it, as a &quot;drug&quot; movie. It's not. It's a cautionary tale about letting your dreams destroy your life. In particular, the &quot;American dream&quot; that's advertised day and night to us. Selby understands this. Aronofsky understands this. Many don't. Not even Amazon.com understands it (read their review of this film. Especially their &quot;Is there anything in this film that any sane person doesn't already know?&quot; line.) It's only after you see the movie, and especially when you read the book, and when you peel away the shock effect layers of the work in your brain days, weeks, months after you see or read it, and realize that what happens to every character in &quot;Requiem For A Dream&quot; could very easily happen to you. All it can take is one wrong decision, like Sara's use of diet pills, or a belief that you can &quot;beat the system&quot; without recognizing your own weaknesses, like Harry, Tyrone, and Marion, to have you spiraling downward. It's that easy. It can happen to any one of us.That's why it's disturbing.",5,Why Requiem For A Dream is so damn disturbing.......,990662400,"05 24, 2001",2001,2995,"['own', 'humble', 'opinion.Requiem', 'A', 'Dream', 'surface', 'not', 'disturbing', 'intense', 'certainly', 'shocking', ""n't"", 'get', 'disturbing', 'peel', 'back', 'layers', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'David', 'Fincher', 'director', 'who', 'very', 'aware', 'material', 'films', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', 'not', 'drug', 'addicts', 'Let', 'repeat', 'NOT', 'drug', 'addicts', 'not', 'Trainspotting', 'Requiem', 'A', 'Dream', 'what', 'about', 'title', 'Dreams', 'Dreams', 'single', 'one', 'have', 'achieve', 'let', 'fall', 'wayside', 'settle', 'something', 'else', 'Then', 'are', 'are', 'so', 'obsessed', 'so', 'ADDICTED', 'dreams', 'are', 'danger', 'destroying', 'good', 'things', ""'ve"", 'created', 'lives', 'pursuit', 'one', 'solitary', 'single', 'goal', 'Requiem', 'Harry', 'Tyrone', 'Marion', 'want', 'have', 'good', 'life', 'want', 'money', 'success', 'want', 'get', 'there', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'take', 'short', 'cuts', 'get', 'there', 'goal', 'taking', 'way', 'too', 'long.So', 'what', 'difference', 'shoot', 'heroin', 'Are', 'addicted', 'cigarettes', 'caffeine', 'sex', 'shopping', 'even', 'Anything', 'can', 'be', 'crippling', 'addiction', 'anything', 'can', 'stand', 'way', 'pursuing', 'dream', 'even', 'realizing', 'could', 'be', 'standing', 'way', 'dream', 'might', 'not', 'even', 'realize', 'it.Sara', 'Goldfarb', 'be', 'thin', 'can', 'be', 'television', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'hate', 'way', 'look', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'body', 'face', 'want', 'Many', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'patience', 'endurance', 'exercise', 'many', 'exercise', 'may', 'not', 'work', 'look', 'other', 'methods', 'Sara', 'Goldfarb', 'neighbor', 'mom', 'sister', 'woman', 'who', 'served', 'coffee', 'local', 'coffee', 'shop', 'today.People', 'are', 'too', 'quick', 'write', 'movie', 'even', 'love', 'quot', 'drug', 'quot', 'movie', 'not', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'letting', 'dreams', 'destroy', 'life', 'particular', 'quot', 'American', 'dream', 'quot', 'advertised', 'day', 'night', 'Selby', 'Aronofsky', 'Many', 'do', ""n't"", 'Not', 'even', 'Amazon.com', 'read', 'review', 'film', 'Especially', 'quot', 'anything', 'film', 'sane', 'person', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'quot', 'line', 'only', 'see', 'movie', 'especially', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'when', 'peel', 'away', 'shock', 'effect', 'layers', 'work', 'brain', 'days', 'weeks', 'months', 'see', 'read', 'realize', 'what', 'character', 'quot', 'Requiem', 'A', 'Dream', 'quot', 'could', 'very', 'easily', 'happen', 'All', 'can', 'take', 'one', 'wrong', 'decision', 'Sara', 'use', 'diet', 'pills', 'belief', 'can', 'quot', 'beat', 'system', 'quot', 'recognizing', 'own', 'weaknesses', 'Harry', 'Tyrone', 'Marion', 'have', 'spiraling', 'downward', 'easy', 'can', 'happen', 'one', 'us.That', 'why', 'disturbing']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut
531038,A30ZPSYOGFJXR6,B00003CXP1,Manola Sommerfeld,"[1, 1]","This was a very interesting film.  Ellen Burstyn is superb as a sweet and lonely widow who simply wants to lose a few pounds and gets addicted to (doctor prescribed) amphetamines.  Her son (Jared Leto) is a serious heroin junkie, along with his best friend (Marlon Wayans, in an excellent role), and girlfriend (Jennifer Connolly).  At the end, all their lives have been destroyed, to a larger or lesser degree, by their involvement with drugs.  They lost their freedom, their mind, their dignity, and quite literally, even more.  The very end of the movie is quite brutal, but the story had been building up to it, so it did not come as a complete shock.  Some parts were too heavy, like the evil and quasi-maniacal attendants in the psychiatric ward.  I thought that was pushing it.  I did like the message, perfectly conveyed by the title.  Drugs will kill whatever dreams you had.  There was no doubt in my mind after seeing this film.The film was slightly amateurish on the hyperreality effects: the chewing, slurping sounds, the mega-visuals, the repetitive sequences.  They look like just taken from the assignment of your first year of film school.Regarding the DVD features: the documentary disappointed me.  I wish it had more structure.  For example, they could have strengthen their explanation of how they filmed some scenes by following up with the finished scene.  The documentary looks like it was put together quickly.  The director's commentary also leaves much to be desired.  Even directors would benefit from rehearsing what they have to say beforehand.  On the other hand, the Independent Film Channel documentary is far better because it is more structured.  Also, the segment with Ellen Burstyn interviewing Hubert Selby is awesome.  He cries, he laughs, he is honest about his life and shortcomings, and comes through as such a humble person.",3,Best Title Ever,1013126400,"02 8, 2002",2002,1867,"['was', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'superb', 'sweet', 'lonely', 'widow', 'who', 'simply', 'lose', 'few', 'pounds', 'addicted', 'doctor', 'prescribed', 'amphetamines', 'son', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'serious', 'heroin', 'junkie', 'best', 'friend', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'excellent', 'role', 'girlfriend', 'Jennifer', 'Connolly', 'end', 'lives', 'have', 'been', 'destroyed', 'larger', 'lesser', 'degree', 'involvement', 'drugs', 'lost', 'freedom', 'mind', 'dignity', 'quite', 'literally', 'even', 'more', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'quite', 'brutal', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'building', 'up', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'complete', 'shock', 'parts', 'were', 'too', 'heavy', 'evil', 'quasi-maniacal', 'attendants', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'thought', 'was', 'pushing', 'did', 'message', 'perfectly', 'conveyed', 'title', 'Drugs', 'will', 'kill', 'dreams', 'had', 'was', 'doubt', 'mind', 'seeing', 'film.The', 'film', 'was', 'slightly', 'amateurish', 'hyperreality', 'effects', 'chewing', 'slurping', 'sounds', 'mega-visuals', 'repetitive', 'sequences', 'look', 'just', 'taken', 'assignment', 'first', 'year', 'film', 'school.Regarding', 'DVD', 'features', 'documentary', 'disappointed', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'structure', 'example', 'could', 'have', 'strengthen', 'explanation', 'how', 'filmed', 'scenes', 'following', 'up', 'finished', 'scene', 'documentary', 'looks', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'quickly', 'director', 'commentary', 'also', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'Even', 'directors', 'would', 'benefit', 'rehearsing', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'beforehand', 'other', 'hand', 'Independent', 'Film', 'Channel', 'documentary', 'far', 'better', 'more', 'structured', 'Also', 'segment', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'interviewing', 'Hubert', 'Selby', 'awesome', 'honest', 'life', 'shortcomings', 'through', 'such', 'humble', 'person']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut
531039,AD3EX5UG7UZPB,B00003CXP1,"Marcos ""proletariat""","[12, 27]","I've always been amazed at the huge following and generous ratings and reviews this film has received. Though it does have its merits, overall I found Requiem for a Dream to be very disappointing. The plot itself offers absolutely nothing new - three friends that fall prey to the horrors of addiction and their lives spiral... how many times have we seen this, and done much, much better for that matter?This is director Darren Aronofsky's sophomore (and sophomoric) effort. While Pi was excellent, Aronofsky uses, as another reviewer excellently puts it, ""gimmicky camera and editing"" and other bad, stylistic shock value techniques such as the extreme accounts of each character's sub-story to attempt to create a dream like or surreal experience, the obvious point of the film, and it simply doesn't work.Even as a recovering addict myself, I felt no connection or empathy towards the characters, except for perhaps the mother character, played by Ellen Burstyn, in part due to her performance and the fact that her story offers something refreshing from the otherwise stale, hackneyed dreck that constitutes thislame attempt to marry art with a hollywood blockbuster. It is absolutely embarrassing watchhing Leto attempt a New York accent, and watching Jennifer Connolly act is like watching paint dry.I think the biggest problem I had with the film was its ending, or maybe it was just the whole damn thing and the feeling you're left with... the problem doesn't lie in the writing but the direction - you are left with this residue-like feeling that the story is shaking its finger at you... as if you just watched a DARE film, not a piece of art. It WOULD normally be refreshing to watch an addiction film that doesn't glorify/romanticize drugs - this film does not, however unfortunately, there is no success here.Some scenes, particularly Connolly's lesbian sex scene, displayed the lengths to which one will go when the disease of chemical dependency/addiction takes over... The problem, though, wasn't that it was explicit so much as it was dragged out long after it made its point, latent with desperate self gratuitous direction.Bottom line is it failed to accomplish what it desperately attempts, making ""Requiem for a Dream"" a rather pretentious title. The only scenes thatremotely induced a successful feeling of surrealism for me were Burstyn's, and I think that was mostly because it offered something mildly different and the POV shots worked.This was painful.",1,Overrated and Hackneyed,1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,2480,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'amazed', 'huge', 'following', 'generous', 'ratings', 'film', 'received', 'have', 'merits', 'overall', 'found', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'be', 'very', 'disappointing', 'plot', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'new', 'three', 'friends', 'fall', 'prey', 'horrors', 'addiction', 'lives', 'spiral', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'done', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'matter', 'director', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'sophomore', 'sophomoric', 'effort', 'Pi', 'was', 'excellent', 'Aronofsky', 'reviewer', 'excellently', 'gimmicky', 'camera', 'editing', 'other', 'bad', 'stylistic', 'shock', 'value', 'techniques', 'such', 'extreme', 'accounts', 'character', 'sub-story', 'attempt', 'create', 'dream', 'surreal', 'experience', 'obvious', 'point', 'film', 'simply', ""n't"", 'work.Even', 'recovering', 'addict', 'felt', 'connection', 'empathy', 'characters', 'perhaps', 'mother', 'character', 'played', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'part', 'due', 'performance', 'fact', 'story', 'offers', 'something', 'refreshing', 'otherwise', 'stale', 'hackneyed', 'dreck', 'thislame', 'attempt', 'marry', 'art', 'hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'absolutely', 'embarrassing', 'watchhing', 'Leto', 'attempt', 'New', 'York', 'accent', 'watching', 'Jennifer', 'Connolly', 'act', 'watching', 'paint', 'dry.I', 'think', 'biggest', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'ending', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'whole', 'damn', 'thing', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'left', 'problem', ""n't"", 'lie', 'writing', 'direction', 'are', 'left', 'residue-like', 'feeling', 'story', 'shaking', 'finger', 'just', 'watched', 'DARE', 'film', 'not', 'piece', 'art', 'WOULD', 'normally', 'be', 'refreshing', 'watch', 'addiction', 'film', ""n't"", 'glorify/romanticize', 'drugs', 'film', 'not', 'however', 'unfortunately', 'success', 'here.Some', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'Connolly', 'lesbian', 'sex', 'scene', 'displayed', 'lengths', 'one', 'will', 'go', 'when', 'disease', 'chemical', 'dependency/addiction', 'problem', 'though', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'explicit', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'dragged', 'out', 'long', 'made', 'point', 'latent', 'desperate', 'self', 'gratuitous', 'direction.Bottom', 'line', 'failed', 'accomplish', 'what', 'desperately', 'making', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'rather', 'pretentious', 'title', 'only', 'scenes', 'thatremotely', 'induced', 'successful', 'feeling', 'surrealism', 'were', 'Burstyn', 'think', 'was', 'mostly', 'offered', 'something', 'mildly', 'different', 'POV', 'shots', 'worked.This', 'was', 'painful']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

Director Darren Aronosfky has achieved deserved recognition for this morality fable about the destruction of four lives by drug addiction. Wonderful performances put this tale right in your face. The stuff dreams are made of is heroin and diet pills. The characters write their own requiem as they descend into hell. Not for the faint-hearted or weak-stomached but well worth watching for the performances---especially Ellen Burstyn who was Oscar nominated for her work here.

531049,AWPODHOB4GFWL,B00003CXP1,"Martin A Hogan ""Marty From SF""","[9, 10]","Director Darren Aronofsky (""PI"") has brought together a story of four people full of hope and allows them to slowly disintegrate into helpless shells.  The director's trick is that you continue to care about these characters throughout the film - not an easy feat.  Leto and Wayans (a nice dramatic turn for the comedian) are best friends caught up in heroin addiction.  Connelly is Leto's girlfriend who has her own problem with cocaine.  Throw in Leto's Mom, Ellen Burstyn and you have an unlikely collection of likeable people on their way towards self destruction.  We already know that all the characters are going to end up in hell or worse, but it's the way that the Director shows the quick and varied descent of each one that makes watching a car wreck seem like kids stuff.Leto and Wayans end results are just as horrific as Connelly's final wasteland.  In fact, in this unedited version, Connelly has some nasty final punishment come her way.  Burstyn is the stand out performer here; with speed (diet pills) induced hallucinations and gritty realistic acting.  What starts out as a simple wish to fit into her favorite old dress turns into insane sequences of distorted reality and terrifying delusions (imagine a killer refrigerator threatening her - it's so real, it's uncanny).Aronofsky's techniques are amazing, with fast cut editing and speed filled action sequences that instill the mood of a nightmare sequence.  There is simply too much symbolism, imagery and artistic endeavor to list here other than to say the scenes are breathtaking.  The dialogue and interaction between characters is genuine and each scene is carefully orchestrated to balance reality from fiction.  It's a hell of a story and a nasty ride, but worth every cinematic moment.There are plenty of extras like Director's commentary (really nice feature), a making of featurette and deleted scenes.",5,Birth Of A Nightmare,1067385600,"10 29, 2003",2003,1886,"['Director', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'PI', 'brought', 'together', 'story', 'four', 'people', 'full', 'hope', 'slowly', 'disintegrate', 'helpless', 'shells', 'director', 'trick', 'continue', 'care', 'characters', 'film', 'not', 'easy', 'feat', 'Leto', 'Wayans', 'nice', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'comedian', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'caught', 'up', 'heroin', 'addiction', 'Connelly', 'Leto', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'own', 'problem', 'cocaine', 'Throw', 'Leto', 'Mom', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'have', 'unlikely', 'collection', 'likeable', 'people', 'way', 'self', 'destruction', 'already', 'know', 'characters', 'are', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'hell', 'worse', 'way', 'Director', 'quick', 'varied', 'descent', 'one', 'watching', 'car', 'wreck', 'seem', 'kids', 'stuff.Leto', 'Wayans', 'end', 'results', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'horrific', 'Connelly', 'final', 'wasteland', 'fact', 'unedited', 'version', 'Connelly', 'nasty', 'final', 'punishment', 'come', 'way', 'Burstyn', 'stand', 'out', 'performer', 'here', 'speed', 'diet', 'pills', 'induced', 'hallucinations', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'acting', 'What', 'out', 'simple', 'wish', 'fit', 'favorite', 'old', 'dress', 'insane', 'sequences', 'distorted', 'reality', 'terrifying', 'delusions', 'imagine', 'killer', 'refrigerator', 'threatening', 'so', 'real', 'uncanny', '.Aronofsky', 'techniques', 'are', 'amazing', 'fast', 'cut', 'editing', 'speed', 'filled', 'action', 'sequences', 'instill', 'mood', 'nightmare', 'sequence', 'simply', 'too', 'much', 'symbolism', 'imagery', 'artistic', 'endeavor', 'list', 'here', 'other', 'say', 'scenes', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'dialogue', 'interaction', 'characters', 'genuine', 'scene', 'carefully', 'orchestrated', 'balance', 'reality', 'fiction', 'hell', 'story', 'nasty', 'ride', 'worth', 'cinematic', 'are', 'plenty', 'extras', 'Director', 'commentary', 'really', 'nice', 'feature', 'making', 'featurette', 'deleted', 'scenes']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

531052,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00003CXP1,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[7, 9]","Requiem For A Dream is one of the best films I have ever seen. Brilliantly co-written and directed by Darren Aronofsky, Requiem For A Dream does in fact attack you with a dramatic and remarkably candid portrayal of what a ""drug"" can mean to someone--and what that ""drug"" can do to someone. For Aronofsky, that drug could be watching television, taking diet pills or street drugs. This film is sure to have a deep emotional impact on you; and as a former social worker I could empathize with the struggles that the three or four main characters live through as they watch the destruction of their dreams because they used drugs to achieve their dreams.When the action begins, we meet Sara Goldfarb, a lonely old widow in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn whose only pleasure seems to be watching a somewhat silly self-help show on television. Her son, Harry, is constantly hocking her television set for money--only what Sara doesn't know is that Harry uses the money to buy heroin for himself and cocaine for his girlfriend Marion. Harry is also friends with a drug dealer named Tyrone; and they scheme to buy and resell drugs on the street for fat profits. Unfortunately, just as others have noted, Harry and Tyrone often turn out to be their own best customers.Sara herself is on a mission. One day she gets a phone call stating that she has already won a spot on the self-help talk show-and when Sara can't fit into her prized red dress, a problem ensues. At first, Sara tried to diet; but this goes nowhere fast. A friend tells Sara about a doctor who is rather liberal with his prescription pad; and this doctor soon has Sara hooked on diet pills that eventually have her jumping around like TWO Mexican jumping beans.In order to make the tragedy of it all even more human and painful for some of us to watch, we see Sara, Harry, Marion and Tyrone all deteriorating as a result of their respective drug habits. It's not a pretty picture; but it's brilliantly acted and portrayed by the filmmakers.Of course, the plot can still go anywhere. What does eventually happen to Sara, Harry, Marion and Tyrone? Will any of them be able to kick their drug habits--and what becomes of any of them if they can't kick their habits? The last twenty minutes of the film give us a skillful expose of their new lives.The DVD has extras: there is a director's commentary with the ""making of"" featurette; and there are deleted scenes. The ""anatomy of a scene"" extra is also very well done.Overall, Requiem For A Dream is probably one of the very best films I have ever seen. It gives us an often painfully candid look at what drugs can do to people and how people must struggle to beat their addictions. I highly recommend this for anyone wishing to study this matter. Unfortunately, the film is so frank that some sensitive people will be uncomfortable; but I believe that they had to make the message strong because that is the only way to truly deal with the issues involved.",5,"painful, candid and essential",1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,2956,"['Requiem', 'A', 'Dream', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Brilliantly', 'co-written', 'directed', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'Requiem', 'A', 'Dream', 'fact', 'attack', 'dramatic', 'remarkably', 'candid', 'portrayal', 'what', 'drug', 'can', 'mean', 'someone', 'what', 'drug', 'can', 'do', 'someone', 'Aronofsky', 'drug', 'could', 'be', 'watching', 'television', 'taking', 'diet', 'pills', 'street', 'drugs', 'film', 'sure', 'have', 'deep', 'emotional', 'impact', 'former', 'social', 'worker', 'could', 'empathize', 'struggles', 'three', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'live', 'watch', 'destruction', 'dreams', 'used', 'drugs', 'achieve', 'dreams.When', 'action', 'meet', 'Sara', 'Goldfarb', 'lonely', 'old', 'widow', 'Brighton', 'Beach', 'Brooklyn', 'only', 'pleasure', 'be', 'watching', 'somewhat', 'silly', 'self-help', 'show', 'television', 'son', 'Harry', 'constantly', 'hocking', 'television', 'set', 'money', 'only', 'what', 'Sara', ""n't"", 'know', 'Harry', 'money', 'buy', 'heroin', 'cocaine', 'girlfriend', 'Marion', 'Harry', 'also', 'drug', 'dealer', 'named', 'Tyrone', 'scheme', 'buy', 'resell', 'drugs', 'street', 'fat', 'profits', 'Unfortunately', 'just', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'Harry', 'Tyrone', 'often', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'own', 'best', 'customers.Sara', 'mission', 'One', 'day', 'phone', 'call', 'stating', 'already', 'won', 'spot', 'self-help', 'talk', 'show-and', 'when', 'Sara', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fit', 'prized', 'red', 'dress', 'problem', 'first', 'Sara', 'tried', 'diet', 'nowhere', 'fast', 'friend', 'Sara', 'doctor', 'who', 'rather', 'liberal', 'prescription', 'pad', 'doctor', 'soon', 'Sara', 'hooked', 'diet', 'pills', 'eventually', 'have', 'jumping', 'TWO', 'Mexican', 'jumping', 'beans.In', 'order', 'make', 'tragedy', 'even', 'more', 'human', 'painful', 'watch', 'see', 'Sara', 'Harry', 'Marion', 'Tyrone', 'all', 'deteriorating', 'result', 'respective', 'drug', 'habits', 'not', 'pretty', 'picture', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'portrayed', 'filmmakers.Of', 'course', 'plot', 'can', 'still', 'go', 'anywhere', 'What', 'eventually', 'happen', 'Sara', 'Harry', 'Marion', 'Tyrone', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'kick', 'drug', 'habits', 'what', 'becomes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'kick', 'habits', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'give', 'skillful', 'expose', 'new', 'lives.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'director', 'commentary', 'making', 'featurette', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'anatomy', 'scene', 'extra', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'done.Overall', 'Requiem', 'A', 'Dream', 'probably', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'often', 'painfully', 'candid', 'look', 'what', 'drugs', 'can', 'do', 'people', 'how', 'people', 'must', 'struggle', 'beat', 'addictions', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'wishing', 'study', 'matter', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'so', 'frank', 'sensitive', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'believe', 'had', 'make', 'message', 'strong', 'only', 'way', 'truly', 'deal', 'issues', 'involved']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

Naturally, reviewers' favorites and those of audiences are often not the same ones. Many viewers will find this look at the effects of drug abuse on four New Yorkers too strong and horrifying. Not too many people got the chance to see the film in its theatrical run, as it was released without a rating, rather than be tagged with the MPAA's dreaded 'NC-17'. New Line is offering an 'R' rated version on video. You can't fight Blockbuster.Sara Goldfarb [Ellen Burstyn] is a widow living in a low-rent high-rise apartment near Coney Island in New York City. She keeps her beloved television, which is about all the company she has, chained to a radiator. Harry [Jared Leto] is a sweet, rather passive guy who is also a junkie. He steals her TV on a regular basis and hocks it for drug money. It's a pathetic game they play, for he always takes it to the same place and she always goes and gets it. As is sadly typical in most families, they never discuss Harry's drug problem, which he shares with his girlfriend, Marianne [Jennifer Connelly], and his best friend, Tyrone [Marlon Wynans]. Sara has addictions of her own. Chocolate is one. A strange game show is another. One day she gets a phone call. The caller claims she is to be a contestant on the show. She is unable to get into her favorite dress, which she hasn't worn in twenty years. At the suggestion of a friend, she goes to a diet doctor who puts her on pills. Soon she is as addicted as her son. The rest of the movie shows the harrowing decline of the characters.Director Darren Aronofsky jazzes up this all too gritty story with some of the most original visuals you can imagine. This is all done with dazzling camera work and very few special effects. He also enhances the picture with a clever, detailed soundtrack. He wisely observes his characters objectively and never sinks into banal moralizing. He makes few anti-drug statements. His theme is the nature of obsessive-compulsive behavior.The cast is marvelous. Burstyn was nominated for an Oscar, and, if there were justice in Hollywood, she would have won. Leto and Connelly are two of our best character actors, and Requiem for a Dream is another entry in their impressive and ever growing resumes.The story is contemporary but hardly new.

531055,ACBA805501SEU,B00003CXP1,Matthew Skidmore,"[5, 9]","Acclaimed film director Darren Aronofsky returns with this dark and disturbing look at the highs and lows of drug dependancy in Brooklyn. Based upon the novel by Hubert Selby Jr. (who briefly appears in the movie), REQUIEM FOR A DREAM paints a pretty bleak picture of the tangled lives of four very individual people - each battling with their own inner demons.The film opens with the introduction of the two main protaganists - Harry (Jared Leto) and Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). We first meet them as they pawn a TV set owned by Harry's mother in the hope of gaining quick cash in order to buy heroin. We later learn that Harry always pawns this TV set whenever he needs a quick fix - thus, stating the low depths this guy will go to feed his own drug dependancy. This initial incident in the picture sparks off the eventual downward spiral that each of the characters encounter. We quickly meet Harrys' girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and his own mother (Ellen Burstyn). Each character is drawn up to provide the audience with an easily identifiable dependancy to relate to. For instance, Harrys' widowed mother is obsessed with geting onto a game show and this slow interest begins to consume her entire life, blissfully unaware that her son is running a drugs racket with his girlfriend and best buddy.Aronofsky throws in every kind of MTV trick in the book to dazzle his audience, which at some times is truly stunning- but, at others comes across as awkward and beguiling. You don't really feel connected to the foursome and their exploits neither interest or depress you in the way that they should (Check out TRAINSPOTTING for a more gritty take on the highs and lows of drug dependancy). The film offers no really likeable people - each character is either mentally depressed or self-obsessed, and no real hope is offered at all (I'm not saying I want a Hollywood style Drugs movie with a 'light at the end of the tunnel' type finale, but life has equal ups and downs, and all this movie is interested in is displaying a beautiful MTV style hell with pretty young people teetering on the edge of their own destruction).The cast are very good, with the exception of lead Jared Leto. His pretty boy looks and dull acting style deny this movie with the strong emotional arm that it needs to succeed. You want to connect to him, but feel nothing for his plight and come away feeling cold and uninterested. Marlon Wayans drops his usual comedy schtick for a well deserved acting role that allows him to develop and excel - he shines in his limited screen time. Jennifer Connelly (who I remember as a little kid seeing her in LABRYNTH and that Dario Argento flick PHENOMENA/CREEPERS) too is pretty good, and she (along with the excellent Ellen Burstyn) pull this movie along giving it a gravitas that it truly needs. Aronofskys' direction is good, with art-house touches here and there - fused with a late 90s MTV sensability that at times dazzles and others infuriates - coming across like a rabid hybrid of David lynch and MIchael Bay.The disc is good - This review refers to the UK Momentum Pictures release. A directors commentary is added plus additional deleted scenes (they don't detract or add to the film). Also, a raw 'making-of' documenatary is good and adds insight into a real making of a movie, ie: it looks pretty dull. Picture quality is good, highlighting Matthew Libatiques' excellent cinematography that changes mood and colour as quick as Aronofsky cuts his movie. All-in-all, a flashy, yet art-house attempt at creating another in the long line of underground american movies that depict the dark and seedy underbelly of the US. Not particularly rewarding or enticing.

Many reviewers have already given positive comments to this masterpiece, so I won't say more about it.SPOILERS WARNING SPOILERS WARNINGWhat I want to say is about the censorship thing. There is absolutely no need for you to go so mad about it, because the scenes deleted do not have so much to do with the story itself.

531064,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00003CXP1,Michael Crane,"[16, 18]","""Requiem for a Dream"" is 102 minutes of pure hell, torture, agony, sadness, and pain.  And yet.... I loved every minute.  This is filmmaking at its best.  This is a film that wasn't made for the sole purpose of making money, hence why this is not a ""Hollywood Movie.""  Directed by the man who brought you ""Pi,"" Darren Aronofsky, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is about how the path to happiness and success isn't always the right one, and how some people are willing to do just about anything to get it.The main focus of this film is addiction.  We are presented the day and life of addicts and what they go through when they either have their fix or don't.  Harry, his girlfriend Marion, and his best friend Tyron, are drug addicts.  They need their fix 24:7.  And when they don't get it, the results are pretty bad.  They come up with a scheme to sell cheaper drugs for more money so they can purchase more drugs and purer drugs.  To them, this is how they can succeed.  If they save enough money, they can purchase the better life.  Well, that better life is going to come with a price tag, and the price isn't money.  The more they use, the more they need.  And the more they need, the more desperate they become, doing whatever it takes to get their next fix.The film isn't only about drug addiction.  It's about addiction in general.  Anything can become an addiction.  Take for instance Sara Goldfarb, Harry's lonely mother.  Her fix is chocolate, sugar, and television.  When she gets a call that tells her she has been chosen to appear on television at a later date, she immediately runs for her red dress.  Unfortunately, with the passing years that have endured her life, she doesn't quite fit into it anymore.  So she goes to a doctor and gets a variety of diet pills.  They make her peppy and hyper.  But soon, she's adapted to them, and she wants more.  The more she takes, the more brutal affect it has on her body and mind.For these characters, what seems to be the path to absolute happiness turns into a gut-wrenching nightmare.  The last 15-20 minutes are the minutes you will NEVER get out of your head, no matter how hard you try and no matter how hard you want to forget them.I was so blown away by this movie.  I had heard so many good things about it and after seeing ""Pi,"" I knew that it was something I would have to see soon.  The movie may be pure hell and torture to watch, but it is done in such a brilliant and enriching way.  The camera movements, shots, and cuts are all so well-executed.  Aronofsky uses his camera techniques to get you right inside of all of the characters' heads, allowing us to experience exactly what they are going through.  People have complained about how all over the place the camera is during the movie, but the whole point is to make you go through exactly what the characters are going through.  It also shows us how fast a fix can take place and how short it is lived.  It wouldn't had been effective if it were done in any other way.The acting was great.  Ellen Burstyn is so great in her role as Harry's mother.  I don't think there's anyone else who could've gotten the job done.  Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans are also terrific in their roles.  You could tell that they were absolutely determined to get their characters down in order to make the story work.As disturbing and unsettling as this movie is, I feel it is an important one for people to see.  Sure it's unrated, but this is something I think they should make mandatory viewing for junior highs and high schools.  Anyone who is thinking of using or experimenting with drugs really needs to see this movie.  I'm sure they'll have second thoughts.  I myself have never done drugs, and seeing this movie reinforces the fact that I will never, ever do drugs.  EVER.The DVD is great and really does the movie justice.  (The menu's hilarious.  It really had me fooled.  I know some of the other reviews gave it away, but I'm not going to.  You'll see what I mean when you get to it.)  The picture and sound quality is sharp and breathtaking.  Some of the extra features are commentary, making-of documentary, deleted scenes, ""Anatomy of a Scene,"" trailers, and much more.I know I've said this before about some other movies, but I think this time it's going to stick:  This is possibly the most disturbing movie I have ever seen in my entire life.

It's a movie I can only watch about once a year.Much has already been written about this movie in the media and several excellent reviews below. The story of how four people fall prey to various addiction is well told. Aronofsky doesn't hit us with the horror right away. He lets us get to know the characters and their dreams before letting their addictions shatter those dreams. The acting is top notch. Leto and Burstyn and (surpisingly) Wayans are excellent. Connelley has gotten a lot of attention for a Beautiful Mind but this is her best performance to date.It's Aronofsky's film-making skill that makes this movie stand out. The relentless editing, creative camera angles and taut pace give the movie a look that's unforgettable.As for the Director's cut vs. edited version. The original movie was unrated because the MPAA wanted to give it the kiss of death with NC-17 (a rating it deserves -- this is NOT a movie for kids even though it's probably the most effective anti-drug message out there). Aronofsky bravely stuck to his guns and sent it out unrated. Blockbuster and other chains refused to stock an unrated movie, so some small edits were made. You won't miss much with the edited version, but I'd buy the Director's Cut on principle.

531067,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,B00003CXP1,Michael J. Mazza,"[5, 5]","&quot;Requiem for a Dream,&quot; directed by Darren Aronofsky, affected me like few other films I've ever seen. &quot;Requiem&quot; tells the intertwined stories of Sara Goldfarb, a lonely widow (Ellen Burstyn), her son Harry (Jared Leto), Harry's girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly), and Harry's best friend (Marlon Wayans). As Sara sinks into a nightmare of prescription drug addiction, her son experiences a parallel hell of &quot;street&quot; drugs. Thus, the film explore two sides of drug addiction in the life of a single family.Aronofsky directs this film brilliantly, and his ensemble cast gives outstanding performances. Ellen Burstyn is heartbreaking in the starring role. In addition to the principal actors mentioned above, Christopher McDonald gives a creepy performance as a talk-show host with whom Sara is obsessed.This is an incredibly intense, upsetting film. Never before have I seen such graphic and relentless images shown in a theater. Aronofsky turns his cinematic eye on the extremes of human suffering, disorientation, and exploitation, and he never flinches. The images and sounds he presents were, to me, more upsetting than Holocaust video, Klan rally footage, or other real-life horrific material which I have seen over the years. And most conventional horror films will look like children's cartoons next to this movie. The final 20 or so minutes of the film are particularly intense; the unsettling musical score and sound effects blend perfectly with Aronofsky's visual symphony of pain.Despite the shocking images, I did not find &quot;Requiem&quot; to be exploitative. I believe this is because Aronofsky never loses sight of the humanity of these characters. Sara and the others are not just cinematic &quot;cannon fodder&quot;; they are characters with whom, despite their faults, we can empathize.&quot;Requiem&quot; is a technical tour-de-force. Be warned: the graphic scenes of sexual exploitation, cruelty, and suffering will, I believe, be simply too much for many viewers to bear. But the discriminating film lover may, like me, find &quot;Requiem&quot; to be a haunting masterpiece.",5,A truly horrific masterpiece,989712000,"05 13, 2001",2001,2121,"['quot', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'quot', 'directed', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'affected', 'few', 'other', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'quot', 'Requiem', 'quot', 'intertwined', 'stories', 'Sara', 'Goldfarb', 'lonely', 'widow', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'son', 'Harry', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Harry', 'girlfriend', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Harry', 'best', 'friend', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'Sara', 'sinks', 'nightmare', 'prescription', 'drug', 'addiction', 'son', 'parallel', 'hell', 'quot', 'street', 'quot', 'drugs', 'Thus', 'film', 'explore', 'two', 'sides', 'drug', 'addiction', 'life', 'single', 'family.Aronofsky', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'heartbreaking', 'starring', 'role', 'addition', 'principal', 'actors', 'mentioned', 'Christopher', 'McDonald', 'creepy', 'performance', 'talk-show', 'host', 'whom', 'Sara', 'obsessed.This', 'incredibly', 'intense', 'upsetting', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'such', 'graphic', 'relentless', 'images', 'shown', 'theater', 'Aronofsky', 'cinematic', 'eye', 'extremes', 'human', 'suffering', 'disorientation', 'exploitation', 'never', 'images', 'were', 'more', 'upsetting', 'Holocaust', 'video', 'Klan', 'rally', 'footage', 'other', 'real-life', 'horrific', 'material', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'most', 'conventional', 'horror', 'films', 'will', 'look', 'children', 'cartoons', 'movie', 'final', '20', 'so', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'particularly', 'intense', 'unsettling', 'musical', 'score', 'sound', 'effects', 'blend', 'perfectly', 'Aronofsky', 'visual', 'symphony', 'pain.Despite', 'shocking', 'images', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'quot', 'Requiem', 'quot', 'be', 'exploitative', 'believe', 'Aronofsky', 'never', 'sight', 'humanity', 'characters', 'Sara', 'others', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'cinematic', 'quot', 'fodder', 'quot', 'are', 'characters', 'whom', 'faults', 'can', 'empathize.', 'quot', 'Requiem', 'quot', 'technical', 'tour-de-force', 'Be', 'warned', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'sexual', 'exploitation', 'cruelty', 'suffering', 'will', 'believe', 'be', 'simply', 'too', 'much', 'many', 'viewers', 'bear', 'discriminating', 'film', 'lover', 'may', 'find', 'quot', 'Requiem', 'quot', 'be', 'haunting', 'masterpiece']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut
531068,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00003CXP1,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[4, 4]","I never read anything about Requiem for a Dream except for an off-hand comment by a reviewer about another movie, ""At least it's not as relentlessly depressing as Requiem for a Dream.""  That's when I realized that no, Requiem for a Dream has nothing to do with What Dreams May Come.  In fact, the two are polar opposites.With a completely fresh perspective (once I realized that Robin Williams was not going to pop up at any moment and crack a joke), I was able to drink in the awful, heady concoction that is Requiem for a Dream.  And it's a testament to Darren Aronofsky that I walked away satisfied and even inspired by what ultimately is a tale of self-destruction.The movie begins with Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) having an argument with his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn) over a television set.  It seems Sara is having a nervous breakdown and has decided to chain her television set to the wall to protect it ""against robbers.""  Then, terrified of Harry, she locks herself in a closet. The two argue through the door...until we realize that the person Sara's really afraid of, who really would steal the television, is Harry himself.  You see, Harry's a junkie.In a routine that's so rote as to become familiar to everyone in the neighborhood, Harry rolls the television set to a pawn shop, who in turn gives him money for it.  And then Sara goes back to pay for it.  The exchange is a pittance (20 bucks), but it's all a lot of work to keep the illusion that Sara is not funding Harry's drug habit.Requiem for a Dream is all about these kinds of illusions.  Behind it all lurks the very real danger of addiction; to people, to things, to routines, to hope.  The movie is truly a sad commentary over what happens when people lose hope.  It is the death of the American dream.From there, the movie branches into two different plots, following Sara and Harry's lives. Overweight, with her husband long dead and her only son stealing from her, Sara is a desperate, lonely woman.  When she receives a phone call that she will appear on a television show (an infomercial that plays incessantly, nattering on about ""Juice""), she struggles to fit into a red dress.  It's the same dress she wore once before, when her husband was alive, during happier times.  Fitting into the dress becomes an obsession, as she shifts from dieting to medication. The doctor doles out four kinds of drugs: three of them uppers and one a downer to make her sleep.Harry, on the other hand, has dreams of his own.  With his buddy Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) and the love of his life, Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly), they hope to stop dealing drugs by ""one last score.""  Harry plans to open a boutique with Marion and live happily ever after. But all of them are addicted to cocaine and they come up with all sorts of excuses to snort it.What's different about this movie from say, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, is the ever-present Aronofsky.  There's no shot he won't attempt, no horrible act he won't film, no technique he won't try.  We watch Sara on speed, as she cleans her entire apartment from top to bottom.  We are continuously assaulted by the RIP-SNORT-AHH rush of the drug trip, which hits the viewer like a rabbit punch to the head. We are with Sara during her bad trips and with Marion during her good trips.  Dreams and hallucinations start to blend together, and always the soundtrack reminds us that this is a nightmare, not a comedy.  These people are real.  They're you're neighbors, your friends, your family...and they need your help.But they never get it.  Nobody has any safety net.  Not Sara or Harry; not Tyrone who lost his mother when he was six; not Marion who sees a psychiatrist that lies to her parents about her treatment.  These people have all been forgotten by friends and family.  They grasp out in vain for dreams that are largely meaningless, struggle to achieve goals without any clear purpose, and ultimately fall, fall, fall...to their deaths, into insanity, or prison.Every actor in this movie is at the top of their game.  Leto does an admirable job as a bleary-eyed dreamer who keeps hoping to make a mythical ""big score"" that will save him from all the rot and ruin.  Connelly's uses her angelic looks to full effect, such that her it's gut-wrenching to watch her beauty (and her innocence) used and abused.  Wayans shows surprising range as a wayward soul who just wants to embrace his mother one more time.  But the real star of the show is Burstyn, who displays amazing range as a mother and an old woman, going slowly mad in the humdrum repetition of her life.  Her role is extremely convincing; enough to bring back some unpleasant memories of my own grandmother's mental decay.Drug-trip movies rarely work well unless...well, unless you're on drugs.  They tend to replicate the experience in such a fashion that if you're not high, the movie is confusing or just plain irritating.  Trainspotting created the canvas for a movie like Requiem for a Dream.  Aronofsky takes it to a whole new level of dread, using sound as much as sight to reinforce the highs and lows of addiction.Requiem for a Dream is not a movie for the faint of heart.  But it is not exploitive or judgemental.  Hubert Selby Jr. isn't just writing about people who are chained to their addictions, he's mourning them.  With Aronofsky's deft touch, a grim book truly rises to the level of a requiem, filled lights and sound that follow its poor subjects to their grim conclusions.

531070,A1JMQ88IMH0XJL,B00003CXP1,Mike,"[0, 0]","REQUIEM FOR A DREAMTHE MOVIE: This movie is not really a 'movie'. I would prefer to call it an experience. What you sit through in this movie affects the people on the screen just as much as it affects the audience. We are put through emotional turmoil watching these characters' dreams slip away from them, we go through the horrors of addiction and experience every emotion that the actors on the screen display. On the subject of acting this movie shows some of the best performances ever in a movie, especially from Ellen Burstyn, who gives a truly indescribable performance. Overall, there is no movie I have ever seen to better the quality seen in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM.THE SPECIAL FEATURES: I would buy this movie on DVD if it had zero special features. It is an essential film for me. It's just a bonus that it has some really cool special features. The best of these is an involving and amazing making of feature that has commentary from Darren Aronofsky. It's stunning to see how much effort and heart went into this production. The Anatomy of a Scene is also very interesting, showing how Aronofsky did many of the camera tricks. We also get quite a few deleted scenes that don't do much to make the DVD better but they don't ruin it either. It's hilarious to see Marlon Wayans mocking JarJar Binks! In Memories, Dreams and Addictions Ellen Burstyn interviews Hubert Selby Jr. about his life. This is a very long interview that doesn't always intrigue the viewer and it was kind of confusing because you don't know if Hubert is being serious or kidding with us. We also get 2 theatrical trailers, a B-roll and audio commentaries from Aronofsky and Matthew Libatique, director of photography.",4,"Movie: 5/5, DVD: 4/5, Average: 4.5/5.",1035158400,"10 21, 2002",2002,1700,"['REQUIEM', 'FOR', 'A', 'DREAMTHE', 'MOVIE', 'movie', 'not', 'really', ""'movie"", 'would', 'prefer', 'call', 'experience', 'What', 'sit', 'movie', 'people', 'screen', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'audience', 'are', 'put', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'watching', 'characters', 'dreams', 'slip', 'away', 'go', 'horrors', 'addiction', 'experience', 'emotion', 'actors', 'screen', 'display', 'subject', 'acting', 'movie', 'best', 'performances', 'ever', 'movie', 'especially', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'who', 'truly', 'indescribable', 'performance', 'Overall', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'better', 'quality', 'seen', 'REQUIEM', 'FOR', 'A', 'DREAM.THE', 'SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'would', 'buy', 'movie', 'DVD', 'had', 'zero', 'special', 'features', 'essential', 'film', 'just', 'bonus', 'really', 'cool', 'special', 'features', 'best', 'involving', 'amazing', 'making', 'feature', 'commentary', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'stunning', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'effort', 'heart', 'went', 'production', 'Anatomy', 'Scene', 'also', 'very', 'interesting', 'showing', 'how', 'Aronofsky', 'did', 'many', 'camera', 'tricks', 'also', 'get', 'quite', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'make', 'DVD', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'either', 'hilarious', 'see', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'mocking', 'JarJar', 'Binks', 'Memories', 'Dreams', 'Addictions', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'interviews', 'Hubert', 'Selby', 'Jr.', 'life', 'very', 'long', 'interview', ""n't"", 'always', 'intrigue', 'viewer', 'was', 'kind', 'confusing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Hubert', 'being', 'serious', 'kidding', 'also', 'get', '2', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'B-roll', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'Aronofsky', 'Matthew', 'Libatique', 'director', 'photography']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

I beg to differ: I admired the film for its intensity, its fine if unorthodox craftsmanship, and its superb performances, but I found it so harrowing and depressing that I can't imagine how anyone could ever love it. Director Darren Aronofsky, writing the screenplay with Hubert Selby Jr. from Selby's novel, strives to recreate the subjective experience of a junkie's addiction, to an extent even films such as ""Drugstore Cowboy"" failed to do. Working with cinematographer Matthew Libatique, editor Jay Rabinowitz and sound man Brian Emmerich, Aronofsky assaults us with the sensory experience of addiction, as experienced by four pathetic losers: junkie Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and speed freak mother Sarah (Ellen Burstyn). Each becomes the perfect, and perfectly horrible, example of the different private hells that junkies fall into. All four actors are superb, but the standout is Burstyn, the saddest of all, a lonely widow who becomes addicted to diet pills in the vain hope of landing a spot on a TV game show. The sight of Burstyn imploding in paranoiac terror, as she hallucinates that her refrigerator is attacking her and the people on TV are laughing at her, will be etched in your memory forever. Whether you want it to be, of course, is another matter. I was glad I saw ""Requiem for a Dream,"" but I think once was enough. The DVD, however, is cleverly packaged (as a video by Tappy Tibbons, the TV motivational speaker Burstyn is obsessed with, played with smarmy ferocity by Christopher McDonald). It contains a compelling ""Making Of"" documentary, as well as a bonus video of Ellen Burstyn interviewing Hubert Selby, who is still the unhappiest kid in Brooklyn after all these years.",4,No middle ground on this film?

It is summertime in Coney Island, NY and there is a sweet and lonely widow named Sarah Goldfarb ( Ellen Burstyn)that lives by herself. Her favorite TV game show is hosted by Tabby Timmons (Christopher McDonald). Sarah receives a phony call from the show telling her that she is going to be the next contestant. Sarah feels that she has to lose weight to fit into her favorite red dress, so that she can look good for the show. Sara visits her local doctor, who prescribes her diet pills that work miraculously. Unfortunately, the pills turn out to be amphetamines. Sarah's son Harry(Jared Leto) and his best friend Tyrone(Marlon Wayans) are heroine addicts that spend all of their time either consuming , or selling to maintain their habbit. However, when their supply is cut off, Harry and Tyrone run into a fatal losing streak that manages to take Harry's girlfriend Marion(Jennifer Connely) down with them. Now all four characters must try and regain control of their lives.&quot;Requiem For a Dream&quot; offers the most realistic look at addiction that I have ever seen. The story is emotional and hard hitting, going back and forth between Sarah and Harry and company. The film is shot brilliantly. The actual ingestion of the drug is extremely graphic and disturbing. After the drug is done, we see a short period when their life seems better. But afterwards, we get to see reality come crashing down on all of them with how quick the effect ends. According to Entertainment Weekly, this film is so realistic that it should be seen in high schools across America. Too bad the NC-17 rating wouldn't sit well with parents. The musical score is haunting, and extremely beautiful. It really helps to drive the movie on the downward spiral that it travels on.All the performances are outstanding. Jared Leto is amazing as Harry. The character offers all the false promises of an addict and a shocking portrayal of using and hitting rock bottom. Ellen Burstyn does the best job in the film. Her portrayal of Sarah is one that we really feel sorry for. The path she travels down, was forced onto her by a dishonest doctor. The emotion that she puts forth is very realistic! Jennifer Connely, Christopher McDonald, and Marlon Wayans are also outstanding.&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is a movie for the ages. It is one that will never fail to amaze audiences everywhere. The amazing story, reality of the drug scene, and performances are all flawless. The DVD is outstanding.

That may be true but I cannot say for sure.  The director is not known for being outspoken about drugs.  He has probably used before.  I really have no idea.  Maybe the reason I don't find this to be an anti-drug movie is because I have never had problems with drugs.  Maybe it would have hit me as pure trash.  I have known people that have had problems but I think that the thing people need to realize going into this, IT IS A MOVIE!  Watch it as a movie.  Don't show it to your kids as a message against drugs.  They will probably think it is a really cool movie and possibly think about using drugs because the film is so good.  When I say it is good I mean you may watch it 20 or 30 times like it has caused me to do.  Most movies I can do other things while watching but I just can't do it with this.  I have to watch it in it's entirety and I can never look away.  So again, just watch it as a movie and don't read too much about it before you see it.Sorry to sort of go off on a rant but all I hear is how this should be considered a documentary and some people even say a bad one at that.  Maybe these people don't watch real movies with great acting performances regularly.  Marlon Wayans will totally blow you away with how you will believe every bad thing that happens to him.  Ellen Burstyn probably gives the best performance overall.  All of the charcters have a drug problem.  Burstyn's character is addicted to weight loss drugs and her son(Jared Leto), his girlfirend, and best friend are heroine addicts.  The movie starts out well enough and drugs seem to be helping them out but when there is a dry spell and no drugs are around, things do not go so well.The cinematography in this movie is one of the most amazing pieces of art I have ever seen on film.  There is a scene where Jared Leto and his girlfriend(Jennifer Connely) are very desperate for money so they decide for Connely to go spend some time with a man who has been wanting to pay for her time for a while.  This is a disturbing part of the film but it becomes one of the most unique moments I have ever seen in a movie.  I would consider this the best score I have ever heard in a movie and it helps out when Connoly has a scene leaving the place of the man who paid for her company and the camera truly makes you feel what she is feeling.  You will have to find out for yourself what she is feeling and it is kind of a scary moment the camera creates.  It was very unique.  I have never experienced a feeling like that in  movie and never have sinced.I have done the best I can to explain this movie.  It is one of my favorites films of all time and I just had to say that and let it out of my system.  Words cannot describe how good the movie is but I have tried.  Every scene from start to finish is absolutely outstanding and yes the ending will hit you hard.  It is tragic, and it is just plain amazing.

It is a very brutal film depicting four Coney Island people and the anti-climax outcome of their lives. There is one thing that they all share, and that is an addiction. Whether it be an addiction to TV, diet pills, or heroin, they are all brought under the spell of the thought that there is a better life beyond the lives they lead.

A very talanted cast consisting of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans bring the story to life in great depth. You begin to feel for the characters and wonder why these normal people have chosen the paths that they have taken to self destruction. Even though this film is not intended for a young audience, it should be seen by any teenager who is thinking of experimenting with drugs of any sort.

It is explicit, upsetting and totally unforgettable.  But fantastic?  Jurassic Park was fantastic, this is on a higher plain.Although the film doesn't really have a message to it other than 'drugs are bad', it thankfully shows both the highs and the lows of the drugs.  This is in sharp contrast to other drugs movies such as 'The Basketball Diaries' that seems to consist almost totally of lows.  It also shows that ecstasy, heroin and cocaine aren't the only forms of drugs on the market.  For example, the same cut shots and editing are used when Harry shoots up as when his mother switches on the TV, eats or drinks her coffee.  The point being that there are plenty of legal drugs on the market that have an equally destructive effect.Finally, the explicit nature of the film: I found myself squirming in my seat a couple of times and there's no doubt that there are some pretty horrific scenes here.  And as for the incredibly explicit sex scenes, it's difficult to call them exploitive when they so clearly show the degradation that the character has gone through to reach this stage.

Fusing MTV-inspired editing, stylised cinematography, a hip-hop score given added grace thanks to some strings and stirringly effective performances from the cast, director Aronofsky has made an unforgettable piece of cinema that deserves to be seen at least once by everyone.Playing like an extremely demented Aphex Twin video (without the absurdist hilarity), Aronofsky makes his actors honourably play perversion-parade for his opus as they misplace their hope of escaping from their mundane lives into chemical charms, from heroin, to coke, to dieting pills. Aronofsky does the right thing in not plumping for the audience's sympathy too much and even in the finale switches from sly comedy to full blown horror with panache. That said, Aronofsky delivers the harrowing moments impeccably also, with the help of some fine editing from Jay Rabinowitz, Matthew Libatique's haunting cinematography and Clint Mansell's brilliant score. Carrying the film though, the actors play their parts just as well, especially Jared Leto and Ellen Burstyn, the former making full use of his big blue eyes to suggest a sweet hope that is tragically tempered by his aimless actions. Burstyn however makes the film hers, especially in the final moments when the audience is shown what she has finally been reduced to; no wonder she announced upon winning Best Female Lead at the Independent Spirit Awards earlier this year that this was &quot;the role of my career&quot;.Film has been attacked for its easy moralising (&quot;Drugs are bad, mmmkay?&quot;), but in his descent into the lowest depths of pop culture hell, Aronofsky gives us a visually resplendent reminder of what the medium of cinema can achieve, if not one of the best school education films about drugs ever made.",4,A Movie Everyone Should See Once,993859200,"06 30, 2001",2001,1917,"['once', 'compelling', 'repellent', 'same', 'time', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'quot', 'Requiem', 'A', 'Dream', 'quot', 'been', 'billed', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2000', 'Fusing', 'MTV-inspired', 'editing', 'stylised', 'cinematography', 'hip-hop', 'score', 'given', 'added', 'grace', 'thanks', 'strings', 'stirringly', 'effective', 'performances', 'cast', 'director', 'Aronofsky', 'made', 'unforgettable', 'piece', 'cinema', 'be', 'seen', 'least', 'once', 'everyone.Playing', 'extremely', 'demented', 'Aphex', 'Twin', 'video', 'absurdist', 'hilarity', 'Aronofsky', 'actors', 'honourably', 'play', 'perversion-parade', 'opus', 'misplace', 'hope', 'escaping', 'mundane', 'chemical', 'charms', 'heroin', 'coke', 'dieting', 'pills', 'Aronofsky', 'right', 'thing', 'not', 'plumping', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'too', 'much', 'even', 'finale', 'switches', 'sly', 'comedy', 'full', 'blown', 'horror', 'panache', 'said', 'Aronofsky', 'harrowing', 'moments', 'impeccably', 'also', 'help', 'fine', 'editing', 'Jay', 'Rabinowitz', 'Matthew', 'Libatique', 'haunting', 'cinematography', 'Clint', 'Mansell', 'brilliant', 'score', 'Carrying', 'film', 'actors', 'play', 'parts', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'former', 'making', 'full', 'use', 'big', 'blue', 'eyes', 'suggest', 'sweet', 'hope', 'tragically', 'tempered', 'aimless', 'actions', 'Burstyn', 'however', 'film', 'hers', 'especially', 'final', 'moments', 'when', 'audience', 'shown', 'what', 'finally', 'been', 'reduced', 'wonder', 'announced', 'winning', 'Best', 'Female', 'Lead', 'Independent', 'Spirit', 'Awards', 'earlier', 'year', 'was', 'quot', 'role', 'career', 'quot', '.Film', 'been', 'attacked', 'easy', 'moralising', 'quot', 'Drugs', 'are', 'bad', 'mmmkay', 'quot', 'descent', 'lowest', 'depths', 'pop', 'culture', 'hell', 'Aronofsky', 'visually', 'resplendent', 'reminder', 'what', 'medium', 'cinema', 'can', 'achieve', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'school', 'education', 'films', 'drugs', 'ever', 'made']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

531092,A2CHLPRJZSD6U9,B00003CXP1,"Mr. S. St Thomas ""suckerfly""","[17, 23]","The stronger story in this moralistic tale of addiction, is the tale of Ellen Burstyn's character. By far, that was the basis of a great piece of filmmaking. The exploration of over-the-counter / prescription drugs, television, weight loss, hyped up marketing ploys was the film that should have been made and thoroughly delved into. Burstyn is a wonderful actor and a film made with that character for 90 minutes, making as many pointed accusations it could about an industry of addiction in denial would have made a powerful film. That was the movie I wanted to see, but that was not what was on offer here.The quick MTV style edits work in the context of Burstyn's segments, but in the long run, the story overall could tell her tale far far better than trickery and sped up montages. This just wasn't done.And as far as the 'youth in trouble' portions of the film, I really was not buying it. As the main character 'shoots up' into the same vein which is now swollen, gaping and oozing, totally remiss of the fact that he has another vein JUST like it on his other arm, was kind of funny. This device was just primarily used to frighten the unaware. Anyone who was/is an addict would look at this character and say, what an [goof]! Now, if he had been using heroin for 10 or 20 years, and every viable entry vein on his body had been thoroughly collapsed, THEN I'd believe it. Regardless of the addiction, heroin users aren't THAT stupid. Insuring you get the next 'hit' relies on you maintaining a reliable 'hitpoint'. Really did not buy that, ruined the whole point of the movie. Went for shock when it didn't need to. Came across like a 1930's drug warning exploitation film, but in colour. After that, the movie just falls apart.Its an interesting watch, and surely worth it for Burstyn's performance throughout, but it honestly works better as a film you'd show to students to scare them off drugs, OR film students interested in editing techniques.

I can blab all day about the superb direction but what l really want to bring to your attention is the Oscar-nominated performance of Ellen Burstyn.  She has already racked up a slew of Best Actress awards from the Chicago, Las Vegas, Boston and Florida Film Critics.  Her Independent Spirit, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations are strong indications that she has an excellent chance at winning her second Best Actress Oscar statuette come this March 2001.  Her character's decent into drug addiction is so harrowing and heartbreaking to watch that you are literally glued to the screen.  The supporting cast all do wonderful jobs with regards to showing their emotional vulnerability on screen.  One of my favourite scenes is in the apartment of Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) where she imagines her refridgerator coming alive, threatening to eat her.  In that one scene alone, the musical score, acting, visual effects and direction are all at their best.  And the scene of Sarah's talk with her son about being old and alone is so heartbreaking.  Acting at it's best, in my opinion.  I bet they will use that very scene as her &quot;Oscar clip&quot; at this years Academy Awards ceremony.  The film is also very dark and sometimes graphic so beware if you're someone who watches only PG movies.  I love the musical score as well.  One of the best of this past year.

Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jenniffer Connolly, and Marlon Wayans give knockout performances as the doomed people who have one kind of addiction or another.  For Sara (Burstyn in her Best Actress nominated role), her addiction is television.  She watches an absurd self help infomercial with hopes that she will appear on it.  When her hopes are elevated, she begins to down diet pills and coffee so she can look thin for the show, and then we watch her slowly deteriorate into madness.  For her son Harry (Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Connolly, looking beautiful as ever), and his friend Tyrone (Wayans), their addictions are heroin and the hopes of making it big in the drug underworld, which they begin to do and then only find everything crashing around them.  Requiem For a Dream is undoubtadly one of the most depressing and heart wrenching films that I have ever seen, and Aronofsky's uncompromising direction shows the viewer the way drug addiction really is: it's not humerous (such as portrayed in films like Trainspotting or even Drugstore Cowboy), and it can be incredibly euphoric, and utterly nightmarish.

It is very dark, upsetting and mean but is also more than a tad bit exploitive of a number of elements that are done more than a bit over the top here. For this reason Aronofsky does cater for the shock market at times. Certainly if you think more about what you are seeing you will realize that the suspension of disbelief is remarkable but not even remotely close to the reality of life. For example - doctors do not rat out addicts to the cops, the neighborhood junkie knows exactly who is driving his car, you don't go around with a septic arm for days without knowing it, electric shock therapy is administered with an anesthetic and heroin dealers certainly don't turn up at the local supermarket in a truck to sell dope to hundreds of people queuing up on the streets. Aronofsky suspends our disbelief. He does is this brilliantly, but folks should reexamine the material a bit more closely before realizing that they have been duped into a wonderfully fantastic reality-based fantasy. Aronofsky even hints this fantasy world to you more than once and even in the closing segments. Requiem for a dream is a DREAM full of hope, desire, anxiety and failure played out to the tune of hyper-realism. It is wonderfully executed but this is fantasy mixed with a dash of reality that unfortunately too many people literally took to heart.This film deserves its place as a cult classic and certainly the director is something of a talent to look out for. The premise revolves around a son addicted to heroin and his mother who is addicted to slimming pills so that she can fit into her nicest dress to play in a popular television game show as a contestant. All the horrors of the American Dream are played out to full effect and everything goes from bad to worse to terrible to extremely severe.When all is said and done this is just fiction with a social comment to make but it is still hard to see what you can take away from it except maybe a sense that some people do end up in a bad way using drugs. However this should be no justification for the kind of brutality that the US government conducts in its own drug wars or the multi-millions of dollars that end up in terrorist hands from the black market drug economy (this is sort of explained during the jail sequence involving a sick guard). I took this movie as a very good social satire that is meant to shock in a ""this is how bad things can get for some people"" sort of way. It is a tad bit exploitative like I said, but heck some people go through this so why not film it.

But the main point of this film is to show what a life of drugs can do to us.  How it will grip us, and not let you, pulling you into situations you dont want to be in..... until it is to late.You feel so bad for these characters, you want to help them, and tell them to stop, but all you can do is sit, watch, and let the tears roll down your face.  It is that powerful.  Other than the story that is a major eye-opener, the movie is filmed wonderfully, from the director of ""Pi"".  I dont believe that I saw one single bad camera view in this whole movie.  And much of the film is showing as if the character is standing still, while the world around them is in fast forward.  The camera work of this flick is great, and any fan of great filmed movies will drool over this work, that is after they cry from the story.If this film does not open your eyes to the harms of drugs (especially heroin) to your body, mind, lovelife, and just plain life, you are crazy.

Requiem for a Dream is just like one of those fast paced trailers, all the way through the film!Of course this is a very depressing, upsetting film about addiction, be it to heroin, diet pills, or television. If you like your films upbeat, stay clear from this film. You'll hate it and curse all those who told you it was great. But if you are a film lover looking for a movie that is masterful and powerful in whatever message it gives, no matter what negative emotions it can create, this one is for you. It takes you right along for the ride as the film's central characters begin to have hope for the good life, then forces you to hold on as their lives take the wrong turn and hopelessly spin out of control into utter despair.The beautiful stylistic choices in this film are endless. From the quick editing to simulate the rush of getting high or the characters insanity, to the heart-pumping music adding to the editing, to the symbolic use of fades, cuts and dissolves to pack in layer upon layer of meaning, this film is a complete masterpiece. It was one of those rare films that gave me the chills of amazement all the way through, the thought &quot;My God, this is an awesome film&quot; running through my mind non-stop. I found it so amazing; I could watch it over and over despite its despair-filling mood. Its genius is enough to distract my emotions away from the doom. There's so much to find in Requiem for a Dream!To any film buff, this one demands multiple viewings to appreciate all the layers of ingenuity. Look past the so-called &quot;gimmicky&quot; editing... it has a reason it's fast paced and stylized, and it's not so it &quot;looks cool&quot; to the MTV crowd. This gets my highest recommendation.

The fact that it could be rated so highly, here and on IMDB, indicates the abysmal emotional immaturity of film fans.&lt;spoiler alert>1. No likable characters - which isn't to say the characters just sit there, no.  They scream off the screen with absolute annoyance.  I hated the characters 15 minutes into the film and wondered how they could possible be turned into something worth watching.  They weren't.  Androgynous boy-man has the voice of a whining buzz saw cutting through a series of jagged metal chalk boards.  Jennifer Connelly manages to disguise her attractiveness under a layer of creepout that was hard, physically hard, to keep eyeballs focused on.  And the Wayans brother is just annoying token-black-man, thrown in to give the Semitic/Anglo couple some ""street cred"".Okay, not all characters in a movie need to be appealing.  But the kicker is, when you get to the end of the movie and you realize you are supposed to feel sorry for them...somehow.  Despite the fact that they never displayed an ounce of decency or humanity.  It's beyond comprehension how I could feel anything other than disgust for them all.So maybe the mother character is sposta appeal?  As she descends into a diet pill frenzy that borders on the comic, and increasingly chews the scenery like a dog with an old bone, you can only hope the movie will end soon so you can begin the process of extracting her visage from your catalog of humanoid faces.2. Displays all the writing and plotting skills of a privileged, protected college student trying to imagine what life on the edge is like.  It's truly laughable.  Truly cliched and trite and laughable.  Token-black ends up arrested by token-Southern-law-officer and sentenced to forced labor.  Semitic junky loses his arm - oh yes, in the South doctors will call the police before treating a case of gangrene - we're just that inhuman.  Creepy chick starts having sex for money and drugs, but we're sposta feel sorry for her cuz she doesn't enjoy it.  Mother goes into an irrecoverable spastic state from diet pills (DIET PILLS!) and has her brain fried with electroshock.  Yeah...that's a believable scenario.  Zathura is more believable.  Childish junk, this ""plot"".3.  Purposeless student film devices.  The quick cutting, the meaningless split screens, the accelerated/decelerated time, the steady cams strapped to bodies - it all screams, ""I am so creative, world look at my genius and despair.""  What's really lovable is the little montage that accompanies every heroin kick - gee, that never gets old.4. Stereotypes - the lovable black heroin dealer, the horrible black sex fiend, the n-word using Southern law officers, the doting Jewish mother and her troop of aimless Jewish mother friends, the creepy bald successful guy.  Every character in this movie is a hack job pulled from the yellowed pages of some pulp novel found on a bus stop rack.5. Laughable drug use - For junkies, these people have awfully fussy biological clocks.  They can go without for any length of time it takes to flesh out some worthless scene.  But then suddenly, they're willing to become sex slaves for a slight taste.  Whatever gets the director to the emotional non-moment he thinks will grab the ghoulies of pretentious film critics.  And then the mother on diet pills?  And she's so stupid she doesn't realize that taking several at a time is inadvisable?6. Ridiculous plot devices - did I cover the hysterical creepy mental hospital where they go straight to the brain frying levels of ECT?  Why didn't the director just do the lobotomy routine from Cuckoo's Nest?  The drug shortage with a special Xmas delivery that means nobody in NYC can get heroin...yes, that's believable.  The man who can't take care of an infection on his arm until...it needs antibiotics?  No, that might be believable.  No, it must be cut off.  Ridiculous!  And the Wayans character...he's operating with the Jewish guy, but he's also in the black mob and they are independent and have money but then don't and...was anybody allowed to review this?  Did nobody giving this drut 5 stars think this was a problem?  The mother with her TV addiction, who just happens to watch the same show ad nauseum?  Believable?  Or just meant to inflict despair?  I claim the latter.Dear dawg, I could go on and on about how insanely bad this movie is, and how I hope the director gets put on the next one-way rocket trip to the Andromeda Galaxy...but what's

531123,A1S3IEVZI29T7H,B00003CXP1,"Raider Jack ""Jackie D Gray-Romeyn""","[2, 3]","""Requiem for a Dream"" offers an absorbing, terrifying, yet fascinating look at the downward spiral associated with drug addiction.  While the picture certainly doesn't tell us anything we don't know already, it is an unflinching look at the possible consequences of drug addiction.  Amazingly enough, while you certainly don't condone even the reasons (excuses?) of each circumstance, you cannot help but feel empathy for the four lives depicted.The standout performance, hands down, is Ellen Burstyn who was cheated out of an Oscar.  Her performance is quite simply spellbinding.  Even more so are the supporting players, most notably, Marlon Wayans.  Because he has previously been cast in comedic roles, it is quite surprising how well he handled such a dramatically demanding role.

All I knew was it was ""depressing"" and about ""drugs"" which is enough to figure out a lot right there.It kicks off somewhere between two worlds... the intense and crude, drop out and score reality life of a young druggie son and his friend and girlfriend, and the the comic, barely believable life of his mother who's in lala land about television game shows. I really wished the two halves made more sense together, but I think they should have left the comedy side out. Some might say the mother's misadventures are a metaphor for the more subtle side of life, we need a fix from TV or food, or a fantasy, just like druggies need it from drugs, but overall this part of the film feels like it can't cover its bases with sincerity... it was a bridge too far to go and seriously hurt the ending for me.The ending itself will be something you'll just go along with, or laugh at.

531129,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXP1,Reviewer,"[8, 9]","The devastating, downward spiral of four individuals addicted to drugs is examined in lurid detail in ""Requiem for a Dream,"" directed by Darren Aronofsky, who paints a vivid picture of the physical and psychological damage that can be incurred by unrestrained chemical abuse.  And it's not a pretty picture.  Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) and Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) are young and in love, but they have a problem; their recreational drug use has long since passed the point of ""recreation,"" and the sad part is, they don't seem to realize it, or if they do, they're into big time denial.  Harry's friend, Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), is in the same situation, and together they spend most of their time and resources trying to score their next fix.  Even the fact that Harry has to repeatedly hock his own mother's television set for drug money doesn't clue them in to how deep their addiction runs; which is a truly sad state of affairs.Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a widow who lives alone, and only wishes that her son, Harry, would come around to see her once in awhile, besides when he needs her beloved TV, which is her only real companion in life.  Sara doesn't realize it, but there's troubled times ahead for her, too, which begin with a telephone call informing her she's been chosen to appear on a television show, which to her is like being given the Holy Grail.  Immediately, she begins to prepare for the moment, but she is bothered by her weight-- her favorite dress doesn't fit anymore.  She's just too fat (she feels) to go on TV.  The solution she discovers, however, is easy.  Prescription diet pills, provided by a doctor recommended to her by one of her friends in her apartment building.  Diet pills, nothing more.  It seems so harmless.Director Aronofsky doesn't pull any punches with this film, and shows-- often in graphic detail-- just what drugs can do to a person.  Some of the images he presents are hard to take, and are not easily forgotten; like the effects of a needle on an arm when injected repeatedly into the same spot over a prolonged period of time, or the delusions caused by ingesting vast amounts of ""speed.""  But the visuals he offers are not the only powerful images; the psychological implications are quite potent as well.  Each character at one time or another seems to comprehend, during one of their few-and-far-between lucid moments, what's happening to them.  But they either do not want to address their situation, or they can't.  Either way, it's harrowing to watch, let alone contemplate.Ellen Burstyn was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for her work here, and rightfully so; her performance as Sara, a woman who gets taken unawares and must do battle with an unexpected demon, is astounding.  It's a challenging, decidedly unglamorous role, and Burstyn certainly gave it everything she had, and it paid off.  Sara is someone with whom you can sympathize on a number of levels, while at the same time, the way she comes into her situation is so disconcerting it makes you want to keep her at arms length, because it's something you don't really want to have to think about.  Out of sight, out of mind.  It's an emotionally taxing part-- for Burstyn, of course-- but for the audience, as well.Jared Leto gives an extremely convincing, believable performance, also, but his character tends to evoke mixed feelings.  On one hand, you feel terrible for him, but on the other, you realize that-- unlike Sara-- Harry came to where he is because of his own unsound judgment and choices, which casts a rather subjective pall over his circumstances, and therefore the way you relate to him.  Still, there's no getting around the fact that it's a depressing situation (to say the least) for everyone involved.The same can be said of Connelly's character, Marion, who seems to go deeper into her situation than the others with her eyes wide open, and it's disturbing to see someone so young, vital and seemingly intelligent allowing this to happen to herself.  Connelly, who admirably of late has forsaken mainstream cinema for roles of more substance in independent films (like ""Pollock"" and ""Waking the Dead""), turns in a memorable performance here, capturing that dark side of human nature and expressing it so well in terms of her character and the path she chooses to take.  And of all of the characters in the film, it is through Marion that you really get a sense of the degradation and loss of self-esteem that comes with the territory to which these people have staked a claim.  And it's just almost too horrendous to consider.The supporting cast includes Christopher McDonald (Tappy Tibbons), Louise Lasser (Ada), Marcia Jean Kurtz (Rae) and Peter Maloney (Dr. Pill).  A powerful anti-drug film, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a stark and realistic look at a problem that affects everyone either directly or indirectly, and it's so effective because there's no attempt to candy-coat the issue.  Aronofsky tells it-- and shows it-- like it is, and like ""Trainspotting"" and ""Traffic,"" it gives you a real grasp of just how far into our lives the tentacles of this evil reaches, and how vulnerable we all really are to it.

It was good, thought-provoking but not a masterpiece. The story revolves around 3 friends who are trying to live the ""good"" life by injecting and smoking as many drugs as they can. Ellen Burstyn plays Sara Goldfarb, the depressed mother of Harry (Jared Leto) who's husband has died. Her luck suddenly seems to change when she gets a call from a tv show called ""Juice"" inviting her onto the show.So, in order to lose weight and look her best, she decides to start taking diet pills. Of course, she becomes addicted and starts to hallucinate. While all this is happening Harry, his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) come up with a way of earning some quick and hard cash by selling drugs on the street. They begin to realise, however, that they aren't the only ones selling and start to receive alot of competition and errr....more violent wake-up calls.The friendship goes to pieces, with Harry having to have his arm chopped off because gangrene or something similar has turned it septic, Tyrone is vomiting and hallucinating in prison and Jennifer starts going mad because there are no drugs around for her. Therefore, she needs to make money by having sex and performing for an audience by participating in a lesbian sex scene to feed her addiction. Sara and Harry's relationship also goes down the drain, with her having to have ECT treatment to get cured and turning 20 years older in the process.The acting is very good, no problems there, and the style of quick cuts from scene to scene is innovative. I especially found the scenes where Sara's fridge is attacking her and Jennifer having sex with another girl at a party particularly effective in demonstrating how drugs can ruin people's lives in the long-run. Good extras on the DVD with deleted scenes, commentaries, interviews, tv spots, trailer, etc. A powerful, ambitious anti-drug film which was just that little bit lacking for me.

531135,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00003CXP1,RMurray847,"[3, 4]","A film that tries to show us the evils of substance abuse by putting us into the heads of the abusers as much as possible.  The film is brilliantly edited so as to become more and more disjointed as the main characters fall deeper into despair.  This is an ""artsy"" movie that for the most part uses all the ""cool"" camera tricks, jump cuts, split screens, etc. for positive effect and not just to show off.We follow Jared Leto and his friend Marlon Wayans, along with Leto's girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, as they decend deeper into their addiction.  At one point, they even come into a lot of money and opportunity, but the drugs destroy it all.  The other main story follows Leto's mother, played by Ellen Burstyn, a lonely older woman who believes she's going to be on a popular TV show, and decides she must loose weight.  She starts on diet pills and begins popping them like candy.The three younger characters chart a more predictable course.  Connelly and Leto have a lovely romance slowly come unraveled.  Wayans sees his dreams slipping through his fingers.  We've seen much of this before, but never this graphically. We aren't held at a distance by the director but rather we are pulled in to see things through their eyes.  All three actors are quite good, and Connelly, in particular is a revelation.  She'd done fine work before (and won an Oscar, of course, for her next film, A BEAUTIFUL MIND).  But it's her work in this film that should have drawn Oscar's attention.  Her final degredation is just about as low as we have seen a character sink in many a year.  Leto is always a good performer, and his final outcome is also a corker.  Wayans meets justice in a more predictable way, and his scenes in prison are almost farcical and are the only times the director totally loses control over the tone of his film.  Wayans is absolutely fine...the script and filmmaking strand him..and that's why the film only gets 4 stars.  It really deserves 4.5.The reason, I think, that Connelly didn't get her Oscar nod for this film is that Ellen Burstyn absolutely runs away with the movie.  To say that her performance is brave only begins to state the facts.  Her character, basically, is driven mad by her addictions.  And we see it from her point of view.  We see how the delusions she suffers COULD drive you nuts.  We pity this poor, lonely woman, whose son is constantly stealing from her to buy drugs.  She is deluded.  Burstyn becomes physically unraveled as well.  I just don't know how she was able to do it.  In years past, we always rave about actor's undergoing physical transformations for their parts (DeNiro in RAGING BULL, Hanks in CASTAWAY, Zellweger in BRIDGET JONES!!) but the transformation Burstyn allows herself to go through is shocking and emotionally draining.This movie is graphic and brutal and not for young kids.  But even though it is R-rated, this could be a ""scared straight"" film for teens.  And adults absolutely should see it.

A gradually accelerating descent into nightmare, both in narrative and imagery, Aronofsky creates a dark tale for our time with skillful and original use of camera and sound. It has resonances with 80's indie movie ""Liquid Sky"" (both subject and definitely soundtrack) and some of the imagery recalls Cronenberg's eXistenz. On this level it works and is a grimly entertaining and challenging film for those of us who like this sort of thing.But a cautionary tale? Yes, like the 1950's propaganda film ""Reefer Madness"" is a cautionary tale. Addiction is an ugly thing and its ugliness is well documented, but Requiem for a dream goes well beyond anything resembling a factual analysis of its subject matter. If you want to use this movie to scare your kids away from drugs, you may have some problems suspending disbelief. Not everyone who abuses drugs is doomed to drug abuse hell, and this film does not embrace the idea of rehabilitation (where ""Trainspotting"" did). Much of the story reinforces old stereotypes and myths about drug dealers and wildly exagerates certain risks. Prescription diet pills leading to electro-shock therapy?This is where my concerns about taking this film too seriously arise. Many points of this story sit uneasily with the issues surrounding our approach to drug abuse and harm minimisation. When Harry seeks treatment for a horribly infected and poisonous wound resulting from injection he is not only arrested but refused treatment.

531142,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXP1,Roland E. Zwick,"[8, 11]","***1/2 Anyone even remotely contemplating getting involved with drugs, either legal or illegal, would have second thoughts after seeing ""Requiem For a Dream,"" a cautionary tale brilliantly directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring the magnificent Ellen Burstyn in an Oscar-nominated performance.In confronting the issue of drug addiction, Aronosky (who co-wrote the screenplay with Hubert Selby Jr.) has chosen to tell two stories that, although they run along basically parallel tracks for most of the film's duration, do occasionally intersect.  That point of intersection is the mother/son relationship between Sara Goldfarb, a lonely widow living in a rundown tenement in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, and her son, Harry, a ne'er do well loser hooked up with a couple of junkies, one of whom is his girlfriend, Marion.  Harry and his friends are well on their way to becoming addicts when the movie opens and, until the supply suddenly peters out, the three of them are having the time of their lives.  Unfortunately, once they hit hard times, all hell breaks loose and their lives quickly become a downward spiral into withdrawal, crime, prostitution, illness and prison.  This is the more conventional side of the screenplay.  Where the film really charts new territory is in the concomitant half which is focused on Sara, a well meaning woman whose obsession to lose a few pounds results in her becoming addicted to doctor-prescribed amphetamines.  For Sara, this leads to an eventual descent into disorientation, hallucinatory episodes and, eventually, madness.Some may find Aronosky's blunt directorial style to be overemphatic, hammer-like and off-putting.  To approximate the feeling of dislocation caused by the various drugs, the director employs a wide variety of cinematic techniques at his disposal: sped up motion, jarring quick cuts, visual distortion etc.  Though it can become a bit much at time, one has to admire the effort to bring the viewer as much into the minds of the characters as is conceivably possible using the resources of filmmaking.  The film is both unsparing and unflinching in showing the physical and psychological damage drugs can cause.  The last section of the film, though it could be accused of lacking subtlety, nevertheless becomes a harrowing journey into a world filled with confusion, despair and pain.Burstyn makes Sara a compelling and sympathetic figure from the very start.  Alone in her drab room, she watches T.V. all day, dreaming of the time when she will matter to someone again.  Burstyn does a brilliant job in showing how, thanks to her increasing addiction, Sara slowly loses her grip on reality and slips over into schizophrenia and madness.  And though we are appalled by the anti-social behavior both of her son, Henry, and of his cronies, we come to see even them in three-dimensional terms, especially through Harry's obvious love of his mother and the tenderness that develops in Harry and Marian's relationship.  The revelatory moment occurs when Harry realizes that his mother is also addicted to drugs, yet how hollow his words sound as he admonishes her to kick her habit.  Even he can do little but break down in tears during the cab ride home and return to his own self-absorbed drug addicted life.  (This is the last time we ever see them together as their lives diverge to follow their own paths towards mutual self-destruction).Special note should be taken of Clint Mansell's subtle and haunting musical score, which brings an air of melancholy uneasiness to this strange world of the drug-addicted mind.Brilliantly acted and superbly directed, ""Requiem For a Dream,"" though not always easy to watch, reveals uncompromising truths that cannot be ignored.",3,powerful anti-drug drama,1010707200,"01 11, 2002",2002,3728,"['Anyone', 'even', 'remotely', 'contemplating', 'getting', 'involved', 'drugs', 'legal', 'illegal', 'would', 'have', 'second', 'thoughts', 'seeing', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'brilliantly', 'directed', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'starring', 'magnificent', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance.In', 'confronting', 'issue', 'drug', 'addiction', 'Aronosky', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'Hubert', 'Selby', 'Jr.', 'chosen', 'tell', 'two', 'stories', 'run', 'along', 'basically', 'parallel', 'tracks', 'most', 'film', 'duration', 'do', 'occasionally', 'intersect', 'point', 'intersection', 'mother/son', 'relationship', 'Sara', 'Goldfarb', 'lonely', 'widow', 'living', 'rundown', 'tenement', 'Brighton', 'Beach', 'Brooklyn', 'son', 'Harry', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'well', 'loser', 'hooked', 'up', 'couple', 'junkies', 'one', 'whom', 'girlfriend', 'Marion', 'Harry', 'friends', 'are', 'well', 'way', 'becoming', 'addicts', 'when', 'movie', 'supply', 'suddenly', 'out', 'three', 'are', 'having', 'time', 'lives', 'Unfortunately', 'once', 'hit', 'hard', 'times', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'lives', 'quickly', 'become', 'downward', 'spiral', 'withdrawal', 'crime', 'prostitution', 'illness', 'prison', 'more', 'conventional', 'side', 'screenplay', 'Where', 'film', 'really', 'new', 'territory', 'concomitant', 'half', 'focused', 'Sara', 'well', 'meaning', 'woman', 'obsession', 'lose', 'few', 'pounds', 'results', 'becoming', 'addicted', 'doctor-prescribed', 'amphetamines', 'Sara', 'eventual', 'descent', 'disorientation', 'hallucinatory', 'episodes', 'eventually', 'madness.Some', 'may', 'find', 'Aronosky', 'blunt', 'directorial', 'style', 'be', 'overemphatic', 'hammer-like', 'off-putting', 'approximate', 'feeling', 'dislocation', 'caused', 'various', 'drugs', 'director', 'wide', 'variety', 'cinematic', 'techniques', 'disposal', 'sped', 'up', 'motion', 'jarring', 'quick', 'cuts', 'visual', 'distortion', 'etc', 'can', 'become', 'bit', 'much', 'time', 'one', 'admire', 'effort', 'bring', 'viewer', 'much', 'minds', 'characters', 'conceivably', 'possible', 'using', 'resources', 'filmmaking', 'film', 'unsparing', 'unflinching', 'showing', 'physical', 'psychological', 'damage', 'drugs', 'can', 'cause', 'last', 'section', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'accused', 'lacking', 'subtlety', 'nevertheless', 'harrowing', 'journey', 'world', 'filled', 'confusion', 'despair', 'pain.Burstyn', 'Sara', 'compelling', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'very', 'start', 'Alone', 'drab', 'room', 'T.V', 'day', 'dreaming', 'time', 'when', 'will', 'matter', 'someone', 'again', 'Burstyn', 'brilliant', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'thanks', 'increasing', 'addiction', 'Sara', 'slowly', 'grip', 'reality', 'over', 'schizophrenia', 'madness', 'are', 'appalled', 'anti-social', 'behavior', 'son', 'Henry', 'cronies', 'come', 'see', 'even', 'three-dimensional', 'terms', 'especially', 'Harry', 'obvious', 'love', 'mother', 'tenderness', 'Harry', 'Marian', 'relationship', 'revelatory', 'moment', 'when', 'Harry', 'mother', 'also', 'addicted', 'drugs', 'how', 'hollow', 'words', 'sound', 'kick', 'habit', 'Even', 'can', 'do', 'little', 'break', 'down', 'tears', 'cab', 'ride', 'home', 'return', 'own', 'self-absorbed', 'drug', 'addicted', 'life', 'last', 'time', 'ever', 'see', 'together', 'lives', 'diverge', 'follow', 'own', 'paths', 'mutual', 'self-destruction', '.Special', 'note', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'Clint', 'Mansell', 'subtle', 'haunting', 'musical', 'score', 'air', 'melancholy', 'uneasiness', 'strange', 'world', 'drug-addicted', 'mind.Brilliantly', 'acted', 'superbly', 'directed', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'watch', 'reveals', 'uncompromising', 'truths', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'ignored']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

To watch a character like that change from a complacent, yet likeable human to what we see at the end of this film is nothing less than tragic.

And you will feel so lucky not to be where the 4 characters are at the end.Set among the beaches of Coney Island, this movie follows four basically good people with dreams and shows how they try to achieve (and fail) at their dreams through drugs. In the beginning, Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) and Tyrone (Marlon Waynes) are dealing, wanting to get a pound of pure heroin and retiring rich. Harry's beautiful girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) wants to open up a clothing store and not depend on her parents anymore. And Harry's mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn) spends her days in front of the TV until she gets a call to be on TV, and she is ecstatic. Dreaming to fit into her favorite red dress, she tries a diet. When that doesn't work, she goes on diet pills. In the first of three parts, these four people are at their height-Marion and Harry are young, in love and on heroin, Tyrone and Harry's business is booming, and Sara finds that her dream of being on TV is a reason to be happy. They are at the top of the wooden roller coaster, and there is no where to go but down.And oh boy, does it go down.As summer ends, the fall comes (quite literally) for these people-whenever something good is supposed to happen, something bad happens instead. Tyrone and Harry's business is dried up and are low on cash, forcing Marion to go to extremes to get money for their score. And meanwhile Sara has been eating nothing but coffee and diet pills. When she gets adjusted she thinks that something is wrong, so she takes more-lots more, and she mentally spirals downward (in one hallucination she is being attacked by her fridge). When these people finally hit rock bottom, it is devestating-all of them land in places worse than death physically, mentally and psychologically.Everything about this movie is fresh, excellent and razar-sharp. Darren Aronofsky is a young indie director with one other film to his name (Pi), and I know that we all will be seeing more of him over the years-he is too brilliant to disappear. The editing is both exaggerated and realistic-the way that they made the drug hallucinations is simply brilliant, and isn't afraid to push the envelope to the extreme. The soundtrack is cutting-edge by the Kronos String Quartet with mixing by Clint Mansell and absolutly PERFECT for the movie-you will not be able to hear the crickets chirp without thinking of the beats to the movie. It's so incredibly haunting.And then there's the acting. Jared Leto manages to impress us and make us forgive him for years of B-movies with his sympathetic performance. In the scene talking to his mother, you can see that he is genuinly scared for his mother when he discovers that she is on diet pills, being a druggie himself. He is basically a good person but doesn't have the power to truly help them. Marlon Waynes is so good in his guilt-ridden performance that for 2 hours you can honestly forget that this is the guy from 'White Chicks' and 'Scary Movie.' Jennifer Connelly is obviously a great actress, but here she demonstrates what makes her a phenomenal actress. Her change from loving Harry with heroin on the side to loving heroin with Harry on the side is truly brilliant. And then there's Ellen Burstyn. She is so brilliant and convincing not just in her drug-induced hysteria but also in her more quiet scenes. I am appalled that she didn't win a Best Actress Oscar over Julia Roberts for her little half performance in Erin Brockovich-a prime example of star power overpowering a great performance. Sure, Julia might have given the best performance (which isn't saying much) in her pathetic romantic comedy-ridden career, but Ellen Burstyn gave the best performance in HER career (after a Best Actress Oscar for Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore and being part of the horror classic 'The Excorcist', that's saying A LOT). All of these great performances will live with you forever.In the fold-out poster that I found inside the DVD, the director says that this movie is the triumph of Addiction over the human spirit, and he couldn't be more right. In the beginning, these people have dreams and seem so close to achieving them. But by the end because of the abuse of drugs their reality is so awful that their dreams become their escape, especially to forget what they did to get the drugs in the first place, and it becomes a circle. Though this is ovbiously an anti-drug movie, it doesn't have a preachy feeling to it. It's as though Darren Aronofsky was simply more interested in how Addiction triumphs and showing Addiction as the hero, not the enemy. I also applaud the movie for not only showing illegal drugs as bad but also innocent legal drugs and how they can be awful for you if used wrongly and eaten like M&Ms.; This is a movie that can possibly make a life change for some people-EVERY PERSON SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE-You will learn more from a dramatization about drugs than any documentary, because this shows and gets deep inside the heads of everyday people and their fall from grace.

We watched the film in our &quot;technical issues&quot; part of the class, and after seeing the film you will see why.  The cuts from scenes and other cinematography will either interest you further in the movie, or turn you away.  Yes, sometimes the &quot;cuts&quot; as you will see, can get a little disturbing and annoying, but, they begin to wear on you and become part of the movie.I recommend this movie for that reason, to see the chance the film makers took on what could have broken the movie.However, this film, as a lot of people have pointed out, is not for the weak hearted.

531152,AD29KEJMCAD76,B00003CXP1,Samhot,"[5, 8]","I am going to try to refrain from writing a lengthy review for this film, and keep it as succint as possible, although for a film like this, the task almost seems impossible. Many reviewers have already said some things that I am going to say, and would have liked to say, but the review will go on, anyway.This is a powerful movie, in which it's main theme centers around drug abuse & addiction, and the dangerous consequences that may follow. But, the film centers on more than just drug abuse and addiction: to me it also centers on life, and how the average folk go about trying to embellish what seems like the emptiness of life. To try and enhance (and possibly) facilitate the meaning of that last sentence, think about this: many people do -- and/or try to reach for -- things that are supposed to make one's life more meaningful and complete: getting married, experiencing the birth of one's first child, going to college, becoming wealthy and/or famous, et al. In society, we are basically brought up to believe that if we follow along certain patterns (e.g. becoming wealthy, etc), we will be happy & fulfilled. One of the many things this film shows us, is that sometimes, what we are brought up to believe, can be a devastating illusion, or at least, there is a strong possibility of this.This story focuses on four main characters, and their addiction to drugs. The story is also cleverly told over the course of four seasons (three, technically), and like another reviewer pointed out a few pages back, the mood of each season correlates with the psychological and circumstantial happenings of each character (or vice versa.) The film starts with the Summer, which correlates with adolescent feelings. In this case, these four characters seemed as if they were happy (or at least we may think they are happy), and seemed to be filled with laughs, smiles and confidence in their future and dreams. In the Autumn, which represents added responsibility, and preparation for ""darker times"", things start to slowly go downhill for the gang. We can see their circumstances beginning to spiral, and their dispositions begin to follow downward as well. By, Winter (which represents ""death"" or the ""ending""), each of these four members seem to meet the ""finality"" of their fates, to disturbing effect, to say the least. Spring, which represents birth, and fresh, new beginnings, never arrived. Heavy stuff, there.Some reviewers have complained about the camera techniques used in this film to be nothing more than flash for flash's sake, and similarly, some have said that some of the disturbing scenes found in the film were there for shock value only. I couldn't disagree more. For starters, like another reviewer has pointed out, the ""speeding up"" and ""slowing down"" techniques are supposed to correlate with the ""speeding"" or ""raciness"" of the characters' thought processes while under the influence of...well...speed (and other drugs.) I found this to be very clever and fascinating. Secondly, while there *are* indeed disturbing images in the film, I didn't necessarily find the images to be the most disturbing aspect of the film, but rather *how* these images were shot. In other words, it's more *psychologically* disturbing, than it is *graphically* disturbing, if that can be basically understood. The way this film was made alone, should not be taken lightly, and it is indeed clever and noteworthy filmmaking. You'd have to see the film for yourself to possibly get a better understanding of what I am talking about.Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly did wonderful and convincing jobs in their respective roles. Their performances truly helped to make the film what it was, and it wouldn't have been as complete without them. Ellen Burstyn's performance seemed to get a droves-worth of accolades, and deservedly so. Her performance was undoubtedly the most frightening, disturbing and heart-wrenching thing about this film. In moments, her character made me laugh, want to cry, and at other times, made me want to turn my head away from the screen altogether. The whole movie is powerful indeed, and the last segment (Winter) is indeed the most intense and hellish part of the movie.I watched this film with another member of my family, and by the time the ""Winter"" segment had arrived, we were *both* saying things like, ""I will *never* watch this movie again. It's a little *too* much reality."" Nightmarish, disturbing, cautionary, thought-provoking, and moving, this film will stay in your mind long after it has ended, and many will gather their own responses as to what the movie meant to them. And, if some of you think that what happened to these characters can't happen to anyone in real-life, think again: it's *very* real, and *can* happen (and no doubt *has* happened to some in real-life.) Indeed, reality can be too much at times.Before I close out this review, let me share a brief story with you about someone who used drugs: it was documented in a program (I can't remember the name of it right now) that a female experimented with a drug, and not too long after that, her friends were quick to comment that she was becoming excessively paranoid and delusional. She was sent to a specialist who did a brain scan on her. When the doctor took a look at the scan, we the viewers (and no doubt the girl, and her mother, who happened to be alongside her) saw something *very* disturbing: there were various holes -- large holes -- throughout her brain: like the equivalent of looking at a piece of cheese after a mouse had nipped through it quite well. The result? This girl now suffers from acute bipolar/manic-depressive disorder. And you know what else? This was the result of her experimenting with a drug: after ONLY ONE TRY! That's right, this girl is now stuck with a ""psychotic disorder"" for the rest of her life, as the result of her experimenting with a drug after only *one* try. Yes, indeed, reality can be a bummer. I recommend seeing this film at least once; this goes for everyone.",5,"Powerful, Unsettling and Real.",1102377600,"12 7, 2004",2004,6039,"['am', 'going', 'try', 'refrain', 'writing', 'lengthy',

Even unfeeling husks like myself will not escape unscathed.This is a beautifully mastered film about drug addiction, but not in standard, drugs-are-bad format.  Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is a junkie who dreams of being a better person but still regularly hawks his mother's battered TV set for fix money.  He and his friend Tyrone Love (Marlon Wayans) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) decide to go into dealing, to set themselves up so that they never have to worry again.Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), Harry's mother, is a lonely widow who spends her simple days watching TV, eating chocolates, and gossiping with her friends.  Until she receives a phone call saying that she has won a chance to be on television, and with this dream comes a revitalization of Sara's life.  Determined to fit into her old red dress when they call her to be on television, Sara embarks on a diet.  Unable to resist food, her only companion through her lonely widowhood, Sara goes to a quack doctor for diet pills.It is extremely fascinating how `Requiem' managed to tackle two separate types of addiction in one movie, blending their patterns, their cause-and-effect, and their rise-and-decline results into one sweeping expanse of cinematic pleasure.  Imbedded behind this well directed and well-photographed movie is an eerie soundtrack, with an ominous score repeated throughout the movie giving audio fuel to the increasingly horrific visuals.`Requiem' will leave you hollowed out, numb, aching in a profound and disturbingly vague way.  It is filled with hope and hopelessness, love and destruction, compulsion and self-defeating purposes, centered around that gaping wound called addiction.  Look for spectacular performances from Ellen Burstyn (The Exorcist), Marlon Wayans (Scary Movie 1 & 2), Jennifer Connelly (Labyrinth), and Jared Leto (The Panic Room).  Each of these actors/actresses give us their best performances to date in `Requiem', and tip your hat to the realism from the supporting cast members.If you watch only one movie this year, make it Requiem For A Dream, and if you only get to watch two movies, then watch this one twice.  Also of note, if this movie touches your soul the way it touched mine, go out and grab up a copy of the book `Candy', by Luke Davies.  Also themed around addiction, it uses the same despairing approach to this tender subject as `Requiem' does.  I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.

Should we assume that it is simply because they're all so obviously stupid? The beautiful Jennifer Connelly, for example, apparently has a talent and wants to design clothes and maybe open her own store, yet she can't otherwise form a coherent thought, like, ""Gee, maybe I should finish high school first!"" Or is it all supposed to be because of their inability to move beyond their bleak surroundings? There are lots of people living in bleak surroundings who don't do what these people did. So what is it? Hmmm?And let's not forget that we're talking about people who not only shoot smack, but whose loftiest aspiration is to become smack dealers themselves so that they can get lots of money fast. In fact, when they're in their money-making ""business"" mode, they seemed to be able to bring their respective addictions under control just fine, thanks.

531157,ACTYP447JCDX0,B00003CXP1,Scott Bresinger,"[11, 12]","This is one of those films that a person can be obsessed with--assuming they can stomach it in the first place.  Since I'm the type of person who's watched ""The Silence of the Lambs"" so many times I've memorized most of the dialogue, and emit enthusiastic laughs at the most horrific scenes, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is kind of like a warm bath.  Of course, since I'm clearly a deranged mutant, what would the ""average"" deranged person think?  For one thing, they might get the idea that heroin isn't all it's cracked up to be, unless of course you long for misery, anguish, pshysical/mental deterioration and the sweet, sweet oblivion of death.  Well, if heroin addiction is too much of an investment for you (I've been told it can take up a lot of your time), but dig the schadenfreude of watching people (okay, actors) experience the other stuff, then this is movie for you!To be fair, since after all I've went and given the film 5 stars, and I honestly do love it, ""Requiem"" is also highly reccommended to anyone sick of the processed, pre-chewed gruel of most mainstream studio fare and want to support challenging, bleeding-edge filmmakers, this is definitely for you.  Director/boy genius Darren Aronofsky has clearly seen the advances of Godard, Tarantino, Tom (""Run Lola Run"") Tykwer and yes, even the best of music videos and decided to do them one better.  If this impulse had been applied to a regular genre picture, like ""romantic comedy"" or ""thriller"" or ""Ashton Kutcher,"" it could have been an embarrassment.  Hubert Selby's original novel was nihlistic, but it was justly hailed for its gritty, hard-boiled style, which most directors seeking to adapt it would have forgotten about, instead delivering just a wallow in suffering.  Aronofsky uses every trick in the editing bag and probably invents a few new ones to make his harrowing tale compelling, even on many repeated viewings.  Sure, dismiss it as an American ""Trainspotting"" if you must, but whereas that film eventually retreated into cheap irony, in ""Requiem"" it's totally organic to the story, and even, dare I say, sincere.Some critics have even sniped at the mother character portrayed so brilliantly by Ellen Burstyn.  An aging, lonely woman as a drug addict?  Come on, they say, be real!  Where they're totally wrong is that while her son and his friends are busy with heroin, this is clearly contrasted with her own addiction to television and ""diet Pills"" (amphetamines).  Addiction is a common denominator of most people--just about everyone has some fix they need to function.  Actually, I wouldn't trust someone without some kind of addiction--in Aronofsky's view, there are no benign addictions.  While I'd argue that point--things like heroin or god are far worse than say, repeatedly watching ""Silence of the Lambs"" or, for that matter, ""Requiem for a Dream,"" Aronofsky's point is made at least as well as the Velvet Undergound's ""Heroin.""  It should also be noted that this isn't an anti-drug polemic.  If anything, Aronofsky wants to point out the futility of legislating, and punishing, what is after all human nature.Actually, the main reason I'm even writing this review is a way to satisfy my anticipation of Aronofsky's next project, the science fiction parable ""The Fountain,"" which the last time I looked was slated for release in early '06 (it had previously been scheduled for December '05).  I can't think of any better way to prepare for what I'm sure will be another mind-blower than to watch ""Requiem.""

What I saw didn't disturb me in the least - I was far more disturbed by ""Taxi Driver"" - it had the raw edge and unpredictability of an ultra-volatile character. Another film I'd very highly recommend for fans of Taxi Driver is ""HENRY: Portrait of a Serial Killer"". Don't waste your time and money on Part-II, just get Part-I by John McNaughton and Richard Fire, and starring Michael Rooker and Tom Knowles.Getting back to Requiem..., I think it was meek and insipid. The only thing that impressed me about the film was the hip-hop collage of sounds and images; inspired sounds of injections, cells expanding, eyes dilating, and a totally unexpected scene of gang war.Jennifer Connelly shines, and Burnstyn is great; their performances being in total sync with their characters. However, Jared Leto was too clean-shaven and nice-looking to have been a solid drug addict that he was portrayed. The much talked about ""Requiem"" scene was not graphic or brutal at all! It was a pathetic scene, one written just to create controversy, and need not have been in the movie at all. It was done very distastefully, and was empty beyond the initial five seconds of shock-value.In fact the movie is not emotionally draining; it's exhausting mentally only because of the suffering of Ellen's character. While I'd recommend the movie to people that like shock tactics, I'd definitely ask the genuine movie lover to stay a hundred miles away from this piece of inspired mediocrity.One more thing; most critics seemed to suggest that this film was about the ""systematic destruction of hope"" - far from it!Even though the things that happen to the main characters in the end, may seem to suggest the ""systematic destruction of hope"", they don't.

The message felt very similar to the personal side of Traffic.  I think Aronofsky got shafted since this film got released the same time Traffic did, and thus got mainly overlooked because it dealt with the same topics.  Requiem looks at addiction in a much more stylized manner, using a lot of the same techniques Aronofsky used in Pi.  Things like the Rozzi-cam, a rig attached to the front of the actor to give you a real subjective feel, and the hip hop montages, cutting certain actions in a similar manner of montage, made their way from Pi and fit very well into this fairly quick paced film. ....

Yes, the ending is much more unsettling then most anything the Hollywood hit machines can crank out, but that's what makes the film so powerful.  The movie is about addiction, plain and simple.  The characters in this movie are so deeply seeded in their addiction that there is no possible way they can come out unscathed (Ellen Burstyn's character may have a chance).Let me reiterate what everyone else is saying about Marlon Wayons performance by saying that he is fantastic in this movie.  I sincerely hope, after seeing this movie, that he never appears in another comedy/spoof film again.  He is that good in this movie.  Jared Leto is the guy who appeared on &quot;My So Called Life&quot; (with Claire Danes), and if you remember him from that role alone, you never will again after this movie.  He is almost too good an actor for someone who appeared on that show.  Jennifer Connelly continues to take the risks as an actress that made me love her so much in &quot;Dark City&quot;.  Yes, she is good looking, but you won't see that at all here, just a great performance.Another actor that few people give mention at all is Christopher McDonald (the ringleader of the info-mercial Sarah watches on T.V.).  This guy has gone from his previous best known role as Shooter McGavin (the great &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot;) to this role, and it really shows his chops as an actor.The bottom line is that you have to watch this movie.  Not only is the cinematography amazing, but after watching it, I promise you will not even think about using drugs for the rest of your natural life.

Though controvertial to no end, I would suggest showing this film to highschool aged kids as a drug deterent tool. It certainly did more for me than any funded drug resistance program I have seen.Beyond the reality check this movie gives, special attention should be paid to the extreme mastery of film the director displays throughout the entire movie.By far the most serious roll I have seen Marlon Wayans play, he pulls it off extremely well showing his skill as more than just another comedic actor. And we can't go without mentioning the beautiful Jennifer Connelly... she has definately grown up since her roll in Labrynth something like 10 years prior.Taking in great acting, directing, and a beautiful story line it should lastly be noted how incredible the score is for this movie, through listening to the music you really feel the power this movie puts out.I can rant and rave about this movie for days and days, but I can put as simple as this... If you like a thinker movie with a real, true life base, it will be extremely hard to find anything better than Requiem for a Dream.

531164,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B00003CXP1,Shashank Tripathi,"[26, 30]","If you have seen Pi, you'll love this one. (I find both movies to be groundbreaking, almost of a class at par with Stanley Kubrick of yore). Aronofsky, a meticulous director, uses some very original techniques to set the tone and convey the themes within this sometimes dark but always beautiful, complex depiction of the nature of addiction.Through use of split screens, revolving cameras, extreme close-up, distorted angles, blasting sound, and repetitive symbols, all in an effort to convey the actual experience of the substance-user under the influence. The film is a visceral experience, unrelenting in its portrayal of each character's descent into their own personal abyss.The film focuses on three main characters: a Jewish mother from Brooklyn, Sara Goldfarb, played by Ellen Burstyn, the son, Harry, played by Jared Leto, and the girlfriend, Marion, played by Jennifer Connelly. Mom is addicted first to television, and as a result of a proposed appearance on her favorite show, decides to lose weight with the aid of diet drugs, prescribed by an unethical physician. Harry and Marion are fond of heroin, but they will settle for something amphetamine in a pinch. All three start out as casual users, but as they persist with their addictions, each character's environment deteriorates and they all sink deeper into unreality. Aronofsky portrays this by having the characters interact with each other in a relatively normal way at first, focusing on the familial relationship between mother and son, and the romantic one between Harry and Marion.The early scenes are brightly lit and pleasant to watch, with many shots of the gorgeous Leto and Connelly lying head-to-head, looking remarkably alike, awash in drugs and love. Even the screen-wide use of the symbols and sounds of drug use seem exhilarating and exciting at first, and it is not until the viewer is bombarded with them relentlessly that they become uncomfortable to watch and hear. Aronofsky splits the film into three parts, subtitled Summer, Fall, and Winter. The seasons change along with the characters, and as time progresses, the characters split from each other, each advancing more deeply into their own addiction and despair. Their individual descents parallel each other, which Aronofsky represents by quick cutting from one character's current predicament to the others, all the scenes infused with garish colors, murky lighting, and disquieting music. At one point Aronofsky unites the characters by showing the visual similarities between the bloodshot, bruised, and terrified eyes of the mother, the heavily made-up, smeared and bleary eyes of Marion, and the infected, bloody and blackened wound that Harry grows on his inner arm.The performances in this film are top-notch, especially from Ellen Burstyn, as a perfectly actualized suburban junkie. Her character is really the sympathetic one, caught not in a desire to get high, but just to be a little more attractive -- a trait so typical of our media-fed society. Also notable in his role is Marlon Wayans, playing against type in a non-comedic role as Harry's drug buddy.In a conventional drug film, the addict usually dies, as a morality play, or to accomplish some finality for the storyline. Aronofsky refuses to go for the easy way out. The last twenty minutes of this film possess some of the most harrowing footage you will ever see, and there is no respite for the viewer or the characters.A definite 5-star and one for your collection!",5,An excellent although somewhat grotesque movie..,1048204800,"03 21, 2003",2003,3487,"['have', 'seen', 'Pi', ""'ll"", 'love', 'one', 'find', 'movies', 'be', 'groundbreaking', 'almost', 'class', 'par', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'yore', 'Aronofsky', 'meticulous', 'director', 'very', 'original', 'techniques', 'set', 'tone', 'convey', 'themes', 'dark', 'always', 'beautiful', 'complex', 'depiction', 'nature', 'addiction.Through', 'use', 'split', 'screens', 'revolving', 'cameras', 'extreme', 'close-up', 'distorted', 'angles', 'blasting', 'sound', 'repetitive', 'symbols', 'effort', 'convey', 'actual', 'experience', 'substance-user', 'influence', 'film', 'visceral', 'experience', 'unrelenting', 'portrayal', 'character', 'descent', 'own', 'personal', 'abyss.The', 'film', 'focuses', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'Brooklyn', 'Sara', 'Goldfarb', 'played', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'son', 'Harry', 'played', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'girlfriend', 'Marion', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Mom', 'addicted', 'first', 'television', 'result', 'proposed', 'appearance', 'favorite', 'show', 'lose', 'weight', 'aid', 'diet', 'drugs', 'prescribed', 'unethical', 'physician', 'Harry', 'Marion', 'are', 'fond', 'heroin', 'will', 'settle', 'something', 'amphetamine', 'pinch', 'three', 'start', 'out', 'casual', 'users', 'persist', 'addictions', 'character', 'environment', 'deteriorates', 'sink', 'deeper', 'unreality', 'Aronofsky', 'having', 'characters', 'interact', 'other', 'relatively', 'normal', 'way', 'first', 'focusing', 'familial', 'relationship', 'mother', 'son', 'romantic', 'one', 'Harry', 'Marion.The', 'early', 'scenes', 'are', 'brightly', 'lit', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'many', 'shots', 'gorgeous', 'Leto', 'Connelly', 'lying', 'head-to-head', 'looking', 'remarkably', 'alike', 'awash', 'drugs', 'love', 'Even', 'screen-wide', 'use', 'symbols', 'sounds', 'drug', 'use', 'seem', 'exhilarating', 'exciting', 'first', 'not', 'viewer', 'bombarded', 'relentlessly', 'become', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'hear', 'Aronofsky', 'film', 'three', 'parts', 'subtitled', 'Summer', 'Fall', 'Winter', 'seasons', 'change', 'characters', 'time', 'characters', 'split', 'other', 'advancing', 'more', 'deeply', 'own', 'addiction', 'despair', 'individual', 'descents', 'parallel', 'other', 'Aronofsky', 'quick', 'cutting', 'one', 'character', 'current', 'predicament', 'others', 'scenes', 'infused', 'garish', 'colors', 'murky', 'lighting', 'disquieting', 'music', 'one', 'point', 'Aronofsky', 'characters', 'showing', 'visual', 'similarities', 'bloodshot', 'bruised', 'terrified', 'eyes', 'mother', 'heavily', 'made-up', 'smeared', 'bleary', 'eyes', 'Marion', 'infected', 'bloody', 'blackened', 'wound', 'Harry', 'inner', 'arm.The', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'top-notch', 'especially', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'perfectly', 'actualized', 'suburban', 'junkie', 'character', 'really', 'sympathetic', 'one', 'caught', 'not', 'desire', 'get', 'high', 'just', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'attractive', 'trait', 'so', 'typical', 'media-fed', 'society', 'Also', 'notable', 'role', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'playing', 'type', 'non-comedic', 'role', 'Harry', 'drug', 'conventional', 'drug', 'film', 'addict', 'usually', 'morality', 'play', 'accomplish', 'finality', 'storyline', 'Aronofsky', 'go', 'easy', 'way', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'possess', 'most', 'harrowing', 'footage', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'respite', 'viewer', 'characters.A', 'definite', '5-star', 'one', 'collection']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

Based on the novel by Hubert Selby, Jr, this film takes you on a ride and doesn't ever let up.Jared Leto is Harry Goldfarb. A drug addict with aspirations of making it as a dealer. Along with his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly), they are all addicted to drugs.Their drug use seems natural and they appear like the prototypical junky. But the most disturbing character transformation is Harry's mother, Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn). She is a widow living alone in her apartment. Harry occassionally drops by to pawn her TV for drugs. But she always goes down to the pawn shop to get it back. When she gets a call one day telling her that she's been selected to be a contestant on a TV game show, she gets very excited and decides to lose a few pounds to fit into a red dress that she absolutely loves. But dieting isn't easy with just willpower so she goes to the doctor that one of her friends recommends. He prescribes her diet pills. Which is basically speed.She starts to lose weight but the pills make her very nervous and anxious. And she doesn't sleep very much. In one of the most memorable scenes of the movie, Harry comes to visit her. He can tell that she's taking speed and tells her that those pills are no good. She asks him, ""Well how would you know? Are you a doctor?"" And his reply is priceless.Somehow the three friends manage to actually deal drugs and put away a good bit of money. But soon their consumption starts to drain the savings. And when the supply of heroin in the city is substantially reduced, they are forced to do desperate acts to maintain their habits.The movie begins to get very dark and disturbing at this point as all of the characters start to sink very low and do things that only the most desperate of addicts will do. The overall message I got is that there are things worse than death that can come from addiction. And if you see this film you will know what I'm talking about.The theme song to this film is haunting and very powerful. I highly recommend it but be prepared to have your nerves completely shot.

As their predicament spirals out of control, and they shed the last vestiges of dignity and restraint, the film hurls you into their darkness - a chasm of moral bankruptcy, hopelessness and decrepitude.Requiem approaches the material with an objectivity that often feels brutally cold, but it handles the characters with a tenderness that makes their already mournful fates emotionally crushing for the viewer. The film does not offer us the comfort of a happy ending, so don't expect to go home smiling.The movie ultimately ends on a note that is starkly (and unavoidably) anti-drug, but this is not a preachy movie with some hidden moral agenda. The objective here is not to highlight the evils of drug use, but to mourn the human cost, weighed in hopes dashed, lives derailed and loves forsaken.

531174,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B00003CXP1,S. Schell,"[9, 11]","From the visionary that brought you ""Pi"", a Sundance Film Festival winner about a mathematical genius trying to unlock the secrets of the world through numbers, comes a tail of misery and melancholy.  For those that enjoy their vast library of romantic comedies, you're probably wondering, ""If the movie's that depressing, why the HELL would I want to watch it?""  Based on Hubert Selby's 1978 novel ""Last Exit To Brooklyn"", ""Requiem For A Dream"" follows the lives of four Coney Island natives as they succumb to their various vices.  Ellen Burstyn is the star of the show and no doubt the best performance of all as Sara Goldfarb, a lonesome widow who day-in and day-out tunes in to her television, fixated by a self-help extremist named Tappy Tibbons (McDonald).  Treasuring a red dress she wore to her son's high school graduation, she aspires to wear it again but she has one small problem - 50 lbs.  She diets to no avail, unable to contain her cravings.  Upon a friend's suggestion, she visits her doctor and receives a prescription for diet pills - her downward spiral begins.Meanwhile, Harry Goldfarb (Leto) is repeatedly pawning his mother's TV to support his smack habit, accompanied by his partner-in-crime and fellow addict Tyrone Love (Wayans).  Besides his endeavors with Tyrone, Harry is involved with a coke-snorting beauty named Marion Silver (Connelly).  The footloose trio begin a trafficking operation in the hopes that they will soon score the purest pound of heroin, earning them the higher living that they dream of.  However, fate is misaligned for the three and a drug deal goes bad, landing Tyrone in jail and Harry and Marion desperate for a fix - their dance with depravity is inevitable.Make no mistake - ""Requiem For A Dream"" will literally heave you through the deepest, darkest vortex of anguish and despair.  Take it from me - I was thoroughly distraught and emotionally drained when the end credits finally rolled.  I even noticed how irritable I felt and how easy it was for me to get upset.  The film so profoundly affected me that it put me in a completely different state of mind; it actually made me feel quite miserable.  While this may be a filmmaker's vital objective, it is not necessarily the greatest thing to gain from it (as I found out for myself).  Even the score is devoid of hope; it is neither beautiful nor enchanting in the least.  In fact, listening to the score itself for a prolonged period is about as hard to take as the film.  Built on an electronica foundation with intermittent segments by the Kronos String Quartet, composer Clint Mansell's compositions are hip and moody sonatas signaling impending doom.Director Darren Aronofsky has reappointed many of his collaborators from ""Pi"", including nearly half his producers, cinematographer Matthew Libatique and composer Clint Mansell.  Aronofsky's vision is perfectly melded with Libatique's inimitable cinematography, providing a feast for the senses.  Using techniques such as jump cuts, peephole magnification, mounted POV cameras and simultaneous uses of time-lapse film and slow-motion frames, Aronofsky gives the viewer a glimpse of the paranoia and euphoria of the characters' highs and lows.  He even gives the time of day a distinct aura; daylight is calm and celestial, while evening is foreboding and dangerous.  Most interesting are the rapid fragments of film we see as the addicts use their drug of choice.  The jump cuts of a butane lighter, boiling heroin, rolled dollar bills, anthills of cocaine that abruptly disappear and the dilated pupils of the user lead to the all- consuming narcotic rapture.  The only thing that becomes tiresome is the loud and embellished whooshing noise that accompanies each jump cut.  Of course, this was probably added to convey the ""rush"" the addict is feeling.Jared Leto is undaunted and slightly disarming as Harry, but his character is hard to sympathize with since he does nothing to help himself or others.  So goes it with Jennifer Connelly as the sleepwalking Marion, a bold beauty that lives only for the moment.  She and Harry latch on to one other in a seemingly devotional manner, but the truth is that their only bond lies in their drive for perpetual sedation. Leto has been in a string of films (both TV and big screen), having made his biggest impression in 1999's ""Fight Club"" as a bleach-blonde devotee to Tyler Durden's detrimental campaign.  Connelly has done much in the industry but her previous roles have left her undistinguished in the eyes of critics.  Since projects such as ""Dark City"", ""Higher Learning"" and ""Waking The Dead"", Connelly has reemerged and proven to be a commanding presence onscreen.  Sara's downfall is the most heartbreaking to witness for she is really the only character that can be sympathized with.  As well as undergoing emotional overhauls for her character, Burstyn endured several physical transformations, all of which entailed four prosthetic necks, two fat suits and nine wigs.  Her final scenes as a cadaverous and delusional Sara are a wonder to behold, Burstyn luminous in all of her character's madness.  Aronofsky personally said of Burstyn's performance, ""What can I say, she's unbelievable.  I hope that audiences will feel they've been robbed by Hollywood, a business that has not hired this woman for twenty years. It's almost a crime on the world because of her abilities.&quot;  I echo Aronofsky's sentiments and say that while Julia Roberts was impressive in Steven Soderbergh's little doozy ""Erin Brockovich"", Burstyn was SORELY UNDERRATED.""Requiem For A Dream"" is not only to be appreciated for its artistry but for tackling an addiction that few of us really understand: FOOD.  The floating mirages of cupcakes, sizzling steaks and such may be humorous to some people, but for others it is inexplicable torture.  To tackle the obsession the world has with physical appearance is a topic that few have endeavored to render onto film and Aronofsky does a terrific job interpreting the anguish that obese people endure every minute of their lives.  Here's some encouragement for those who question watching this dour ditty: Burstyn was nominated for Best Actress in twelve different festivals (including the Oscars and the Golden Globes) and Matthew Libatique won an Independent Spirit Award for his cinematography.  Warning to those who expect an uplifting denouement: stray far from this film - it will take you down with it.",5,Nightmarish Jaunt Into Despair,992390400,"06 13, 2001",2001,6455,"['visionary',

If being bombarded with many of the same images throughout the film isn't enough to make you feel this way, then the onslaught of style over substance--sped up action, rotating cameras, fisheye lenses, split screen effects--that stands in for a compelling plot will.  Based on the 1970s novel of the same title, ""Requiem for a Dream"" chronicles the predictable downward spiral of several characters whose otherwise empty lives revolve around drugs of one kind or another.  The most interesting of them is a diet-obsessed TV junkie (Ellen Burstyn, who rather disturbingly resembles ""Three's Company""'s Mrs. Roper here)--we see her devolve into a hideous sketch of her former self with the help of physician-endorsed speed.  By comparison, the troubles of blank-faced co-stars Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans seem trivial and almost a distraction.  I'm probably just too old to be moved by it all; overwrought sequences of people lazing about, freaking out while searching for their next fix, or turning to one form of human degradation or another in desperation just seem cliched and emotionally sterile, perhaps because I still remember ""Gridlock'd,"" ""Trainspotting,"" ""Naked Lunch"" and ""Drugstore Cowboy.""  Nonetheless, I'm guessing younger people will be pretty impressed, and to be fair, the acting and technical tricks occasionally almost make up for the low budget and paper-thin story.  The soundtrack by Kronos Quartet is also sufficiently hip and brooding to match the mood of the film, but mute the sound during any of the repetitive ""getting high"" or ""tripping bad"" scenes and see if it still seems like something meaningful is going on.  While I saw the unedited version, I'm stumped as to what was deemed the equivalent of ""NC-17"" material, as there's nothing here I haven't seen on HBO--ratings nowadays really do seem rather arbitrary.",3,M'eh . . .

531180,A6R8XUE6MJLMC,B00003CXP1,Stuart Winer,"[1, 1]","This film belongs in the category of great-cinema-experiments.  Darren Aronofsky's main work here is about cinematography and emotional tone and the powerful haunting soundtrack.  All these factors were just brilliantly done and very moving as were many scenes which portray mental and emotional collapse. These people are down to their last mental threads - their desolation is total and very compelling.Unfortunately the plot and character development here are just too flat to really allow this film to be truly great. Instead it becomes just stark, powerful art-house verite' - not quite a full entertainment.The chief flaw is that we just don't really know the characters very well, so that when they slip into self-destruction and despair it doesn't have the impact that it should.  We can imagine their suffering - they're all terrific actors..but I didn't really feel them - they weren't full, real people to me.Maybe it's that Jared and Marlon were just unrepentant junkies.  Could they maybe have aspired to become real people?  They were flat, empty shells for years before the movie started, so we never see their decline - they were always worthless, and cruel to say, they got what was coming to them.  I don't mean that I enjoyed their demise, but I found it hard to care about them - they were long gone before the story started and were actively digging their own graves.Jennifer Connelly, however, was really heartbreaking. She's just luminous - I have a thing for her - .  Her acting is completely transparent to me such that I feel I'm looking right through her body and witnessing her hurting spirit.Watching her repeatedly trade sex for drugs was very ugly and disturbing - like a voluntary rape.

This is nominally a movie about addiction.  The four main characters each have their own drug problems - three out of four are addicted to heroin, and the last (Ellen Burstyn in a heartbreaking performance) to metamphetamine crash diet pills.  But this is not just a drug movie.  No, the truth is in the title - this is a movie about people whose dreams, simple harmless fantasies, are completely destroyed.  As such, the movie is ugly, unflinching and sometimes painful to watch.  If you have the slightest amount of humanity, you will feel the characters' despair as your own.A large amount of the credit for this goes to great performances from actors who don't normally get such good roles - you can feel the desperation in each of them, their performances are so scarily plausible.  Watching each deteriorate into their own mental and physical hell is the part of the impact of the movie, and each pulls it off nicely.  The remainder of the credit is divided between director Darren Aronofsky, whose brilliant experimental style plants you in the characters' psyche, and Clint Mansell, whose score alternates between an elegaic string part (which has now been used in everything from car commercials to the trailer for the Lord of The Rings trilogy) and pounding, incessant techno, both of which serve to emphasize the numerous forms of agony that are central to the film.Is it easy to watch?  No.  The drug use is more graphic than anything seen on film before (including Trainspotting), there is  intense violence and a sex scene which is both physically and morally sickening.  For what it is, is it perfect?  No.  Both Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly are forced to work with characters that are slightly underdrawn in favor of the admittedly more powerful stories of Jared Leto's and Ellen Burstyn's roles.  But is it compelling? Yes.  Important? Yes.  This movie will stay with you for the rest of your life.  I can think of no better way to persuade someone to never, ever do drugs in their lifetime than showing them this film.

This becomes more obvious if one reads some of the negative reviews here at Amazon.I read here in some reviews that this movie is poor because...it's depressive! Since when do films need to be cheery to be good? Is life that way? Is reality, anybody's reality that way? I read in other reviews that this film is not good because &quot;there's no message involved&quot; or because &quot;there's no ethics defended&quot;. I really fail to understand such mindsets. This film is a depiction of reality, a very particular reality, that of people being addicted to heavy drugs and the lives they lead. THAT is the message. It's simply a raw depiction of a specific reality that millions of people (esp. in the west) are experiencing daily. Now, as far as &quot;ethics&quot; are concerned, i'll say this: if the director endulged in some heavy pedagogic diatribe via this film to tell us that &quot;drugs can be dangerous for you&quot; i'd simply say &quot;duh&quot; and watch something else. Besides, he does show that in a more than obvious way. But thankfully, he doesnt attempt to shove an agenda down our throats.Now to the film itself: I'd already been super-impressed with the director's previous film (the equally brilliant &quot;Pi&quot;) so i was more than intrigued about this one.I was rewarded again by Aronofsky as a viewer. This film has great camera work (it's through and through cutting edge stuff visually) , great acting, minimal but efficient dialogue,and an absolutely superb conceptual soundtrack (most of it is based on one theme).It surely is hardcore in its visuals but there's more quality here to be discovered as the director doesnt try to impress with cheap and unrealistic scenes. There's nothing in the film that's over the top or exaggerated and that might sound as self-understood but there are more than enough films with a drug theme that stretch things to extremes visually as if depicting things realistically isn't overwhelming enough.No need to describe the plot as 10s of other reviews have already done so, so I'll simply reccommend this film (as many others did too) to anybody with a passion for groundbreaking cinema. Extra kudos for Burstyn's performance which is definately show-stealing but even more credits for the fact that &quot;Requiem for a dream&quot; doesn't merely stay on the illegal drug scene but takes a hard stab at the legal drugs. Legal they may be, but there's literally millions of people battling serious addictions from them and they continue to be prescribed massively nevertheless.An ode to antihypocrisy as well as great filmwork.",5,"Original, cliche-sparing drugavaganza...",1077494400,"02 23, 2004",2004,2689,"['reasons', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'are', '-in', 'opinion-', 'not', 'easily', 'graspable', 'most', 'people', 'more', 'obvious', 'one', 'negative', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon.I', 'read', 'here', 'reviews', 'movie', 'poor', 'depressive', 'when', 'do', 'films', 'need', 'be', 'cheery', 'be', 'good', 'life', 'way', 'reality', 'anybody', 'reality', 'way', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'film', 'not', 'good', 'quot', 'message', 'involved', 'quot', 'quot', 'ethics', 'defended', 'quot', 'really', 'fail', 'understand', 'such', 'mindsets', 'film', 'depiction', 'reality', 'very', 'particular', 'reality', 'people', 'being', 'addicted', 'heavy', 'drugs', 'lives', 'lead', 'message', 'simply', 'raw', 'depiction', 'specific', 'reality', 'millions', 'people', 'esp', 'west', 'are', 'experiencing', 'daily', 'Now', 'as', 'far', 'quot', 'ethics', 'quot', 'are', 'concerned', 'i', ""'ll"", 'say', 'director', 'endulged', 'heavy', 'pedagogic', 'diatribe', 'film', 'tell', 'quot', 'drugs', 'can', 'be', 'dangerous', 'quot', 'i', ""'d"", 'simply', 'say', 'quot', 'duh', 'quot', 'watch', 'something', 'else', 'Besides', 'show', 'more', 'obvious', 'way', 'thankfully', 'attempt', 'shove', 'agenda', 'down', 'throats.Now', 'film', ""'d"", 'already', 'been', 'super-impressed', 'director', 'previous', 'film', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'quot', 'Pi', 'quot', 'i', 'was', 'more', 'intrigued', 'one.I', 'was', 'rewarded', 'again', 'Aronofsky', 'viewer', 'film', 'great', 'camera', 'work', 'cutting', 'edge', 'stuff', 'visually', 'great', 'acting', 'minimal', 'efficient', 'dialogue', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'conceptual', 'soundtrack', 'most', 'based', 'one', 'theme', '.It', 'surely', 'hardcore', 'visuals', 'more', 'quality', 'here', 'be', 'discovered', 'director', 'doesnt', 'try', 'impress', 'cheap', 'unrealistic', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'film', 'top', 'exaggerated', 'might', 'sound', 'self-understood', 'are', 'more', 'enough', 'films', 'drug', 'theme', 'stretch', 'things', 'extremes', 'visually', 'depicting', 'things', 'realistically', ""n't"", 'overwhelming', 'enough.No', 'need', 'describe', 'plot', '10s', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'so', ""'ll"", 'simply', 'reccommend', 'film', 'many', 'others', 'did', 'too', 'anybody', 'passion', 'groundbreaking', 'cinema', 'Extra', 'kudos', 'Burstyn', 'performance', 'definately', 'show-stealing', 'even', 'more', 'credits', 'fact', 'quot', 'Requiem', 'dream', 'quot', ""n't"", 'merely', 'stay', 'illegal', 'drug', 'scene', 'hard', 'stab', 'legal', 'drugs', 'Legal', 'may', 'be', 'literally', 'millions', 'people', 'battling', 'serious', 'addictions', 'continue', 'be', 'prescribed', 'massively', 'nevertheless.An', 'ode', 'antihypocrisy', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'filmwork']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

It is one of those movies that sticks with you for days, weeks, months, and years after you watch it. As you watch it, you become hypnotized and can't think of anything but this blur of images pounding on your brain, one image after another. It is an experience like no other.Requiem For A Dream, based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr.,  is the story of 4 people; A woman, her son, his girlfriend, and his best friend. This woman, Sarah Goldfarb, played amazingly by Ellen Burstyn, is the lonely, T.V. addicted mother of Harry Goldfarb, played by Jared Leto, a drug addict who wants to make it big in the dealing business, Tyrone C. Love, played surprisingly well by Marlon Wayans, his best friend and partner in crime who misses his dear mother, and Harry's girlfriend Marion Silver,  played well, as usual, by Jennifer Connolly, a severely depressed artist who plans on starting her own business.During the summer, everything was perfect; Harry and Tyrone were making hard cash, Marion had ideas for her store, and Sarah had a place in the sun outside with the other old ladies of the apartment building. Life was sublime. Total bliss. Then Sarah recieves a phone call from her favorite game show, which says that she is going to become a contestant. She is very excited, not knowing that she will never ACTUALLY be on the show. She decides she is going to wear her favorite red dress but cannot fit into it. After several diets, she decides to try diet pills.Then comes the winter. Harry and Tyrone's business is failing due to a shortage of drugs and money to buy drugs. The money gradually disappears, and everything falls apart. Now Harry, Tyrone, and Sarah are all hopelessly addicted and dependent on drugs. Marion is performing sexual favors for people in order to make money for Harry's business. All this leads up to a disturbing and shocking conclusion. This movie is truly a masterpiece.This movie is the one thing that really convinced me, never in my life, to do drugs. Not some cartoon they might show you in health class, or one of those pointless ""this is your brain on drugs"" commercials. A remarkable film.

However terrible their fates are, the sympathy evinced at their plights pales compared to that evoked by the suffering of the fourth victim - the main characters' mother who unlike them is perhaps completely innocent and blameless for her addiction to legal medicines over-prescribed to her by her unscrupulous doctor. Her hell is mental.Extremely harsh, pessimistic and fatalistic throughout, the film takes the viewer on an emotional rollercoaster as we watch inevitably as their lives are torn to pieces. The world minus the four characters is extremely callous and unmerciful, from the opportunistic 'John' who trades the girl drugs for sexual humiliation to the hospital medic who deliberately misleads the mentally obliterated woman into signing a form allowing them to pulverise her brain with (perhaps) unnecessary shock treatment to the redneck doctor (the film is very harsh towards the medical profession) who instead of treating the main character Harry for gangrene has him jailed instead. The acting is superb (particularly the old lady and the young woman) throughout and the soundtrack is excellent, chirpy jarring violins evoke sentiments of melancholy and an impending crescendo of doom. The director uses some innovative methods, the quick flashing images of pupils dilating and chemicals being sucked down a syringe and the slow motion effects used to portray the feeling of being drugged are very effective particularly.This film is also perfectly titled (ok credit to the author not the film), a requiem is a prayer for the dead/a dream is hope for a new beginning, the film leaves us in absolutely no doubt which of the two is most appropriate here.

Although the characters lived far from what you and I would consider to be normal lifestyles, they shared something in common with each and every member of the audience; hopes, aspirations, dreams. Sara Goldfarb (played so wonderfully by Ellen Burstyn) dreams of one day being on a TV show, and one day, gets her chance. She fantasizes about how she could wear her favorite red dress, which she wore to her sun's graduation, on television; however, upon trying to wear the red dress, Sara discovers that she has gained some weight over the years and tries desperately to lose her weight, eventually resorting to medication. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly play a young loving couple, Harry and Marion, who dabble in heroin and plan to make a big sale along with their friend Tyrone (Shawn Wayans) so they can be set for life and Marion can open up her own (legal) business. Unfortunately, their recreational drug use turns into day-to-day addiction, and things start to get ugly.  The movie documents how for each of the 4 people are effected and eroded by drugs.The look of the film is extremely stylized, but justifiably so. Aronofsky uses surreal imagery as a vehicle for realism, something that really works when done well, and done well it was. By using a combination of slow and fast motion shots, extreme close-ups and more edits than you can shake a stick at; Aronofsky successfully brings the audience into the world and mind of someone with a drug problem. The audience visually experiences first-hand what it is like to be 'scared' or 'high'; all this in 3rd person; all this in the comfort of the theatre chair.  Of course, all of this effort would be in vain if it didn't mean anything at the end. The film leads the audience down a spiral of addiction until the grand finale, which features a montage of graphically intense scenes and images with more edits per second than any film. The pacing at the end, when compared to earlier parts of the movie, was so fast that some viewers may find it hard to keep up, and it will literally take your breath away when the credits came up. All in all, the effect was amazing, and something that audiences haven't felt much since ""American Beauty"" and ""American History X"".  As the title indicates, ""Requiem for a Dream"" does not contain a happy ending. It is in no way optimistic and only gives the audience faint pieces of hope and happiness; however, it does show what desperate people are willing to do, and how desperation will change someone's life to its entirety.

531202,A2QSN9JTY9CLDW,B00003CXP1,Tim Bare,"[4, 5]","Requiem for a Dream is one of the best movies of the last decade, and possibly even in the history of cinema. It is a movie that speaks to the soul, a film that connects with the deepest stirrings of humanity that every man, woman, and child harbors within them. It is not a fun movie; by no means is this a piece of entertainment. But it is art, a powerful, engaging, harrowing piece of art that will be remembered for its brutality and honesty for years to come.The film follows four people in Brooklyn, all in some way trapped in addiction: Sara, a middle-aged woman who gets a call that she is going to be on television, and in an effort to reclaim a time of lost happiness, goes on diet pills to fit into the dress she wore at her son's graduation; Harry, her son, who has become addicted to heroin after high school and quests with his friend Tyrone to get a pound of uncut heroin; the aforementioned Tyrone, who has slipped into drugs to remember the comfort of his dead mother; and Marion, Harry's girlfriend, who slips into sexual decadence to get money for her addiction as Tyrone and Harry's plan falls through. The four begin at a stage when everything is easy, and slowly they spiral into the hell of addiction, always clinging to the hope that it will be as good as it once was.The movie is beautifully shot, with Aronofsky's trademark rapid montage style being used to good effect here. The score is one of the best I've ever heard, played to perfection by the impeccable Kronos Quartet. And the acting, my god, the acting.Each of the principal performers gives a tour de force performance, truly capturing the joy and despair of addiction.As Aronofsky himself said of Hubert Selby, Jr., the author of the novel on which this film is based, there is light and darkness. And this film is about the darkness. But its there, with a flashlight, searching for our humanity in that darkness. And that is the kind of film any filmmaker should aspire to make.",5,This is storytelling,1093305600,"08 24, 2004",2004,1966,"['Requiem', 'Dream', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'last', 'decade', 'possibly', 'even', 'history', 'cinema', 'movie', 'soul', 'film', 'deepest', 'stirrings', 'humanity', 'man', 'woman', 'child', 'harbors', 'not', 'fun', 'movie', 'means', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'art', 'powerful', 'engaging', 'harrowing', 'piece', 'art', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'brutality', 'honesty', 'years', 'come.The', 'film', 'four', 'people', 'Brooklyn', 'way', 'trapped', 'addiction', 'Sara', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'who', 'call', 'going', 'be', 'television', 'effort', 'reclaim', 'time', 'lost', 'happiness', 'diet', 'pills', 'fit', 'dress', 'wore', 'son', 'graduation', 'Harry', 'son', 'who', 'become', 'addicted', 'heroin', 'high', 'school', 'quests', 'friend', 'Tyrone', 'get', 'pound', 'uncut', 'heroin', 'aforementioned', 'Tyrone', 'who', 'slipped', 'drugs', 'remember', 'comfort', 'dead', 'mother', 'Marion', 'Harry', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'sexual', 'decadence', 'get', 'money', 'addiction', 'Tyrone', 'Harry', 'plan', 'four', 'begin', 'stage', 'when', 'everything', 'easy', 'slowly', 'spiral', 'hell', 'addiction', 'always', 'clinging', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'once', 'was.The', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'Aronofsky', 'trademark', 'rapid', 'montage', 'style', 'being', 'used', 'good', 'effect', 'here', 'score', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'played', 'perfection', 'impeccable', 'Kronos', 'Quartet', 'acting', 'god', 'acting.Each', 'principal', 'performers', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'truly', 'capturing', 'joy', 'despair', 'addiction.As', 'Aronofsky', 'said', 'Hubert', 'Selby', 'Jr.', 'author', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'light', 'darkness', 'film', 'darkness', 'flashlight', 'searching', 'humanity', 'darkness', 'kind', 'film', 'filmmaker', 'should', 'aspire', 'make']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

Now that that's out of the way, we move on.This is also easily the most disturbing movie I have ever seen, chronicling the downfall of a small group of Coney Island residents, due to their despairs and their addictions.

Consider a scene in which a character is dealing with the conflicting effects of taking uppers and downers at the same time.  As we watch through a distorted lens, everyone around her speeds up and slows down at random, creating a disjointed effect.Playing with speed and sound may seem a bit gimmicky to some, but no one can possibly doubt the power of Ellen Burstyn's performance.  As she plays out her characters descent, there were many times I forced myself to remember:  &quot;It's only an act.  She's really just fine.&quot;  Also of note is Marlon Wayons.  Yes, *that* Marlon Wayons.  This is his first truly serious role (please, don't tell me you count &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; as serious!), and he does it with aplomb.

Requiem for a dream is a very touching movie, the music fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the film and captures each moment perfectly. The camera work is also superb, the director uses certain camera angles to capture the feeling of drug usage, anxiety, and depression in a way that is intelligently artistic.  This movie is an absolute stroke of genius. In requiem for a dream we are introduced to 4 characters, harry(mrs goldfarbs son, marions boyfriend, and tyrones best friend), marion(harrys girlfriend), mrs goldfarb(harrys mother), and tyrone(harrys best friend) played by jared letto, jeniffer conelly, elain burnsty, maryln wayans.  Each of the main characters each have dreams and means in which to reach them..the main charachter harry sets out to help his girlfriend to be free from her parents grasp and the grasp of others that are doing nothing but giving her money and loaning to her, by coppin an ounce of pure to fund for her to be able to open her own clothing shop. He sets out with his friend tryone on a quest to achieve that dream that leads them through a breath taking finish.. also in the movie mrs goldfarb goes through alot to reach her own dreams..all i have to say to you is that this movie is absolutely excellent, every shot,every second, every frame of this movie is absolutely perfect..it is a sad movie yes but the movie starts out with excitement and hope just like one has when they are trying to reach a dream..an absolute fabulous movie.. i recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys cinema this is one for the ages******HOWEVER LIKE ONE OTHER REVIEWER SAID.. I DONT THINK ANYONE SHOULD GET THIS COPY OF THE MOVIE.. THIS IS THE R RATED COPY..

531217,A3VOW473J03GOB,B00003CXP1,"Wayne ""waynesworld857""","[24, 32]","This is the most powerful condemnation of substance abuse ever put on film. Darren Aronofsky has used his artistic vision first to suck you into the world of the four main characters, then to take you on their slow, inexorable plunge into the hell of addiction. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a lonely widow living in a small, modest apartment near the abandoned beaches of Coney Island. She naively views her son Harry (Jared Leto) as a ""good boy"", even though he keeps pawning her TV to buy heroin. Harry has a best friend, Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and a girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connelly) who are also into drugs. Sara's dream is to appear on television; she is obsessed with the idea and virtually addicted to a show by a self-help guru. Harry and Tyrone dream of one day making a big score, raking in a fortune and putting their financial worries behind them. Marion's dream is to design clothes and run her own business. But mind-altering chemicals cloud their judgment and dissolve all of their hopes.The screenplay was co-written by Hubert Selby, Jr. and Aronofsky, adapted from Selby's novel. Aronofsky's use of unconventional film techniques, sound and music is nothing short of brilliant. He is unflinching in his portrayal of the depravity to which addicts are driven. Harry and Tyrone, though drug users and dealers, are not thugs; they are sympathetically portrayed as misguided misfits, as is Marion. When Harry and Tyrone are unexpectedly exposed to the violence inherent in the drug trade, it leads to their introduction to the criminal justice system. Marion is finally reduced to selling her body for a fix.  Meanwhile, Sara's dream to be on TV is about to come true. Her mistake is in trusting a quack doctor who prescibes amphetimines to help her lose weight fast so that she can fit into her favorite dress for the big event. She starts to over-medicate which causes irrational mood swings and eventually, hallucinations.  Ellen Burstyn's performance earned her an Oscar nomination (she should have won). By the end of the film, she is almost unrecognizable; a burned out, babbling speed freak. All four characters are reduced to self-loathing, pitiful shells of themselves, curled up in a fetal position. Their nightmarish, gut-wrenching journey is mesmerizing and disturbing. If a positive movie experience for you is a sugar-coated adventure to the land of happy endings, avoid this one.The DVD is available in an R-rated and Unrated version; the unrated version has slightly more explicit sex, but nothing that impacts on the plot or the overall effect of the film.",5,A BRILLIANT WORK OF ART,1069632000,"11 24, 2003",2003,2595,"['most', 'powerful', 'condemnation', 'substance', 'abuse', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'used', 'artistic', 'vision', 'first', 'suck', 'world', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'then', 'take', 'slow', 'inexorable', 'plunge', 'hell', 'addiction', 'Sara', 'Goldfarb', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'lonely', 'widow', 'living', 'small', 'modest', 'apartment', 'abandoned', 'beaches', 'Coney', 'Island', 'naively', 'son', 'Harry', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'good', 'boy', 'even', 'pawning', 'TV', 'buy', 'heroin', 'Harry', 'best', 'friend', 'Tyrone', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'girlfriend', 'Marion', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'drugs', 'Sara', 'dream', 'appear', 'television', 'obsessed', 'idea', 'virtually', 'addicted', 'show', 'self-help', 'guru', 'Harry', 'Tyrone', 'dream', 'one', 'day', 'making', 'big', 'score', 'raking', 'fortune', 'putting', 'financial', 'worries', 'Marion', 'dream', 'design', 'clothes', 'run', 'own', 'business', 'mind-altering', 'chemicals', 'cloud', 'judgment', 'dissolve', 'hopes.The', 'screenplay', 'was', 'co-written', 'Hubert', 'Selby', 'Jr.', 'Aronofsky', 'adapted', 'Selby', 'novel', 'Aronofsky', 'use', 'unconventional', 'film', 'techniques', 'sound', 'music', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'unflinching', 'portrayal', 'depravity', 'addicts', 'are', 'driven', 'Harry', 'Tyrone', 'drug', 'users', 'dealers', 'are', 'not', 'thugs', 'are', 'sympathetically', 'portrayed', 'misguided', 'misfits', 'Marion', 'When', 'Harry', 'Tyrone', 'are', 'unexpectedly', 'exposed', 'violence', 'inherent', 'drug', 'trade', 'introduction', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system', 'Marion', 'finally', 'reduced', 'selling', 'body', 'fix', 'Meanwhile', 'Sara', 'dream', 'be', 'TV', 'come', 'true', 'mistake', 'trusting', 'quack', 'doctor', 'who', 'amphetimines', 'help', 'lose', 'weight', 'fast', 'can', 'fit', 'favorite', 'dress', 'big', 'event', 'over-medicate', 'irrational', 'mood', 'swings', 'eventually', 'hallucinations', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'performance', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'end', 'film', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'burned', 'out', 'babbling', 'speed', 'freak', 'four', 'characters', 'are', 'reduced', 'self-loathing', 'pitiful', 'shells', 'curled', 'up', 'fetal', 'position', 'nightmarish', 'gut-wrenching', 'journey', 'mesmerizing', 'disturbing', 'positive', 'movie', 'experience', 'sugar-coated', 'adventure', 'land', 'happy', 'endings', 'avoid', 'one.The', 'DVD', 'available', 'R-rated', 'Unrated', 'version', 'unrated', 'version', 'slightly', 'more', 'explicit', 'sex', 'nothing', 'plot', 'overall', 'effect', 'film']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

This is a woman on the cusp and you have no doubt in your mind she's going to go over...what an incredible performance in this scene...Marion's prostitution and transformation into a full-blown junkie...you love her so much, and you hate her too for doing this to herself.  Her degradation at the end was so un-sexual and I have no clue as to why the MPAA made such a big deal out of it...but what it was, and this is why I think they censored it and slapped it with an NC-17...was that it was NOT senseless....this scene is in there to show her humiliation, not her pleasure.  And that this will surely not be the last time she does this.  And sex that isn't mindless is not palatable to us sheep.  Thus, the NC-17.  What a pity we are treated like morons.Marlon Wayans, what a surprise...'nuff said...and Jared Leto...the center of the film....never thought he had it in him.  When he turns his head away and suggests that Marion goes on the date (trick?) with Arnold for money...my heart broke.Add this to the visual style of the movie, the music, the sound...believe me folks...screw the MPAA and what they think is ok to see and not ok to see...this is an IMPORTANT film...on a critical level, you will never see performances stronger than these in any movie released in the last 2 years.  On a social level...once you see this...once you see these characters (and that ARM!) go from healthy and loving to wisps of souls, you will never ever consider doing drugs...and if you already do, you will reconsider.  Unless you are Harry, Marion, Tyrone, or Sara...chracters who can never turn back.The moral?There is a point where salvation will never find you. So don't even start walking in that direction.Excuse me now, kiddies.

531227,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00003CXP1,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","I didn't discover Darren Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000) until after discovering its great score. We've all heard this powerful score somewhere over the last dozen years or so since it's been cut & pasted ad infinitum, but I wasn't aware of its name or what film it was originally derived. I finally tracked it down to ""Requiem for a Dream."" The reason it was hard to uncover is because the movie was unsuccessful at the box office, likely due to its NC-17 rating, even though it's generally regarded as a near masterpiece, albeit in the downbeat sense.""Requiem for a Dream"" is a film about substance addiction, legal or illegal. The film stars Ellen Burstyn as a Brooklyn widow who has to deal with her addict son (Jared Leto), whom she loves too much to render the necessary ""tough love."" Jennifer Connelly plays the son's girlfriend and Marlon Waylans his best friend, both equally addicted.The film utilizes various creative picture/editing techniques to relay its tale of a slow descent into hell on earth. The characters are understandably kind of pathetic and the story is only moderately absorbing, until the end, that is. The climax is a powerful indictment of drug abuse, legal or illegal. So potent, in fact, that I literally wept (!).The NC-17 rating mainly has to do with a shocking climatic scene involving Connelly's character at some stag party, but there's an R-rated version that relays all the information you need to know. I've seen both and, although I prefer uncensored films, the edited version is worthy. Besides, the cut scene is available on youtube for anyone who's interested.BOTTOM LINE: While the story is only mildly absorbing it has great acting and is filled with kinetic filmmaking, which is both interesting and sometimes annoying. But the ending is pummeling in a horrifying sense, and the score is a veritable masterpiece. However, the film's unrelenting denunciation of substance abuse keeps it from being entertaining in the conventional sense, which isn't a problem for me, but it might compel others to never want to see it again, if at all.GRADE: B-",4,Unrelenting denunciation of substance abuse,1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,2100,"['did', ""n't"", 'discover', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'Requiem', 'Dream', '2000', 'discovering', 'great', 'score', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'powerful', 'score', 'somewhere', 'last', 'dozen', 'years', 'so', 'been', 'cut', 'pasted', 'ad', 'infinitum', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware', 'name', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'derived', 'finally', 'tracked', 'down', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'reason', 'was', 'hard', 'uncover', 'movie', 'was', 'unsuccessful', 'box', 'office', 'likely', 'due', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'even', 'generally', 'regarded', 'near', 'masterpiece', 'albeit', 'downbeat', 'sense', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'film', 'substance', 'addiction', 'legal', 'illegal', 'film', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Brooklyn', 'widow', 'who', 'deal', 'addict', 'son', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'whom', 'too', 'much', 'render', 'necessary', 'tough', 'love', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'son', 'girlfriend', 'Marlon', 'Waylans', 'best', 'friend', 'equally', 'addicted.The', 'film', 'various', 'creative', 'picture/editing', 'techniques', 'relay', 'tale', 'slow', 'descent', 'hell', 'earth', 'characters', 'are', 'understandably', 'kind', 'pathetic', 'story', 'only', 'moderately', 'absorbing', 'end', 'climax', 'powerful', 'indictment', 'drug', 'abuse', 'legal', 'illegal', 'So', 'potent', 'fact', 'literally', 'wept', '.The', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'mainly', 'do', 'shocking', 'climatic', 'scene', 'involving', 'Connelly', 'character', 'stag', 'party', 'R-rated', 'version', 'information', 'need', 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'prefer', 'uncensored', 'films', 'edited', 'version', 'worthy', 'cut', 'scene', 'available', 'youtube', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'story', 'only', 'mildly', 'absorbing', 'great', 'acting', 'filled', 'kinetic', 'filmmaking', 'interesting', 'sometimes', 'annoying', 'ending', 'pummeling', 'horrifying', 'sense', 'score', 'veritable', 'masterpiece', 'However', 'film', 'unrelenting', 'denunciation', 'substance', 'abuse', 'being', 'entertaining', 'conventional', 'sense', ""n't"", 'problem', 'might', 'compel', 'others', 'never', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'all.GRADE', 'B-']",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut

It is unique, thought-provoking and deals with unflinching honesty about one of the most important yet sloppily analysed facets of our modern liberal society, drug addiction, whether legal or illegal.There are many reasons why this is an important film:Firstly the subject matter - drug addiction and it's effect on all our lives - is intelligently and thoughtfully explored.  Not something one encounters often in films noawadays.Secondly the production and direction are masterful.  The Director uses many innovative techniques to create emotions often outside of the cinematographic repertoire.  The final half of the film feels as if you are in a mad dizzying rush forward as the film drives onwards to it's harrowing, emotional climax.  It may not be the most subtle approach but it succeeds beyond doubt.Thirdly, the film is not hindered by nostalgia, it is brutally honest in how it thinks the protagonists would behave in real life and attains a strong degree of realism.  The result of this is that the film is often harrowing and disturbing but never greatuitously.  The viewer is not manipulated and treated in a condescending way as in so many films - this feels real.Fourthly, the performances are first-rate - Ellen Burstyn in particular puts in a great turn as the doting mother with an inadverent addiction to slimming pills.Darren Aronofsky, the Director, shows a uniquely compelling approach with serious subject matter.
