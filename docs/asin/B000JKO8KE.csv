1027549,ACYTCGZWKTF93,B000JKO8KE,Anupam Satyasheel,"[9, 11]","Regardless of its flaws and faults, KANK is a bold and realistic attempt to portray the dilemma of Indian NRI's who live American lives but marry as per Indian norms. Where the director falls short is not in the right idea but in the realistic characterization, and following a script that rarely portrays the pains of two loveless marriages. A serious topic needs a serious portrayal. Karan Johar's otherwise popular attempts at comical relief have gone awry in KANK because the treatment never gets serious enough to call for a break. Pains of relationships bound by social pressures and traditions, are not an Indian wedding (KHNH) or a teenage romance (KKHH). Mixing fun and humor with such a serious issue can distract the audience and KANK suffers on this account.The flaws of script and lack of right directorial focus can, sometimes, be made up by individual acting brilliance. Unfortunately, the movie is not helped by the typical 'Sharukh Khan show'. Neither does a reasonably happy looking Preity Zinta make the audiences sympathize with her husband's perpetual lack of involvement. Abhishek and Rani share another loveless marriage but that does not come across as a serious issue apart from during a few outbursts. Amitabh is brilliant but his impact is to distract the audience if at all and KANK's last hope is lost with his demise before the critical climax. His brilliance if properly utilized might have helped a rescue act. Even music, an otherwise strong aspect of a Karan Johar movie, rarely attains the heights Shankar Ahsan Loy have scaled in the past.Overall, KANK - a bold effort at saying goodbye to conventions - has less that succeeded because of factors that are obvious in hindsight. Sadly, even the genius that he is, Karan Johar, did not see it while directing KANK. Nonetheless, Indian cinema will be better off with KANK in its archives than without it - not so much for what the movie achieves but for what it fails to attain.",3,Goodbye to the conventions,1169078400,"01 18, 2007",2007,1961,"['Regardless', 'flaws', 'faults', 'KANK', 'bold', 'realistic', 'attempt', 'portray', 'dilemma', 'Indian', 'NRI', 'who', 'live', 'American', 'lives', 'marry', 'Indian', 'norms', 'Where', 'director', 'short', 'not', 'right', 'idea', 'realistic', 'characterization', 'following', 'script', 'rarely', 'pains', 'two', 'loveless', 'marriages', 'serious', 'topic', 'serious', 'portrayal', 'Karan', 'Johar', 'otherwise', 'popular', 'attempts', 'comical', 'relief', 'have', 'gone', 'awry', 'KANK', 'treatment', 'never', 'serious', 'enough', 'call', 'break', 'Pains', 'relationships', 'bound', 'social', 'pressures', 'traditions', 'are', 'not', 'Indian', 'wedding', 'KHNH', 'teenage', 'romance', 'KKHH', 'Mixing', 'fun', 'humor', 'serious', 'issue', 'can', 'distract', 'audience', 'KANK', 'suffers', 'account.The', 'flaws', 'script', 'lack', 'right', 'directorial', 'focus', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'made', 'up', 'individual', 'acting', 'brilliance', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'not', 'helped', 'typical', 'Khan', 'show', 'reasonably', 'happy', 'looking', 'Preity', 'Zinta', 'make', 'audiences', 'sympathize', 'husband', 'perpetual', 'lack', 'involvement', 'Abhishek', 'Rani', 'share', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'not', 'come', 'serious', 'issue', 'apart', 'few', 'outbursts', 'Amitabh', 'brilliant', 'impact', 'distract', 'audience', 'KANK', 'last', 'hope', 'lost', 'demise', 'critical', 'climax', 'brilliance', 'properly', 'utilized', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'rescue', 'act', 'Even', 'music', 'otherwise', 'strong', 'aspect', 'Karan', 'Johar', 'movie', 'rarely', 'heights', 'Shankar', 'Ahsan', 'Loy', 'have', 'scaled', 'past.Overall', 'KANK', 'bold', 'effort', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'conventions', 'less', 'succeeded', 'factors', 'are', 'obvious', 'hindsight', 'Sadly', 'even', 'genius', 'Karan', 'Johar', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'directing', 'KANK', 'Nonetheless', 'Indian', 'cinema', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'KANK', 'archives', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'movie', 'what', 'attain']",Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna
1027550,A3VI8KO303141L,B000JKO8KE,bekagoose,"[1, 1]","I believe this to be one of Karan Johar's best productions! Here's why:First a synopsis of the movie. We are first introduced to Dev (Shahrukh Khan) who just won a huge soccer game and is calling his wife, Rhea (Preity Zinta) to tell her. From their exchange we can tell there is tension between the two, with Dev mentioning that he now makes more than Rhea, and Rhea apologizing for not making it to the game. Then we are moved to Maya (Rani Mukerji) getting ready for her wedding. By the look on her face we can tell there are doubts. Then we meet Rishi (Abishek Bachchan) who is talking with his father, Sam (Amitabh Bachchan), about if Maya will really marry him. So we already know these two have some doubts. On Maya's wedding day she ends up meeting Dev and they have a conversation about marriage and love and happiness. Both part ways and Maya marries Rishi, and on his way out Dev is hit by a car.We then fast forward four years to Dev limping while he is waiting for Rhea to get done with her jog. From the dialogue that takes place in the next few scenes we see how cynical Dev has become and how irate he is towards not only Rhea but his son, Arjun. We also see Maya treating Rishi like a child because she cannot have any. Dev, Rhea, Maya, and Rishi all end up meeting each otehr through a hysterical misunderstanding involving a kidnapper named &#34;Black Beast.&#34; I found the misunderstanding seriously funny, and the one liners that Dev gives are hysterical.Fast forward a few scenes (I don't want to give too much away!). We get a taste that the movie involves an affair of some sort when Dev and Maya find Rhea and Rishi hugging each other on a busy street. The following scenes where they confront their spouses without directly saying anything about an affair are hysterical. It is extremely funny to watch all four of their reactions to the accusation. Dev and Maya then begin to form a friendship and try to help each other fix their marriage. The massage scene between Dev and Rhea, as well as the cheap stripper scene between Rishi and Maya, are so funny to watch, as both are blundering their way through trying to be better spouses. This is followed by some serious scenes after both couples celebrate their wedding anniversary. Dev accuses Rhea of being selfish and heartless for never considering him in her decisions. And Rhea accuses Dev of being insecure in the fact that she is the bread winner in the family, and that he places his failures on her shoulders. Maya and Rishi argue of the lack of intimacy in their relationship, not only physically, but emotionally as well. Intermission is preceded by Dev telling Maya that he loves her, which is what we all have known and been waiting for to happen. After intermission we see Dev and Maya engage in a relationship with each other as they struggle with their spouses and with each other. I won't say anymore because it'll ruin the story but it is fantastic.Now performances! SRK did fabulous as the cynical husband with insecurities. He is wonderful in this role and is perfect for it. Preity Zinta did a wonderful job playing a character that is not bubbly, but rather more refined and career driven. She was perfect in this role. Rani Mukerji was great as Maya who is struggling with the inner conflict of loyalty to her husband and the only family she has and her own selfishness of wanting love. I haven't seen a lot of movies with Rani so I don't know how this performance compares to her other roles. Abhishek Bachchan is fabulous as Rishi the ultra loving husband who just wants to have sex every once in a while! He adds a dose of comic relief to this ultra serious topic.  And we find a kind man who loves Maya desperatley. Amitabh Bachchan also adds great comic relief with his gallivanting ways! All four main characters were perfect for their roles and the chemistry between all four was perfect. And all four can seriously cry when it's called for! And they are believeable in their roles!What I like most about this film is that it take a serious topic and gives it the appropriate attention it needs but it also has some non-serious parts (especially in the beginning). This adds flavor to the movie, and it breaks up the seriousness of the film, which I think is important in order to keep the audiences attention. Karan Johar did a fabulous job making sure that the audience would sympathize with all characters. We symapthize with Dev because he was at the top of his game when he lost it all and finally finds joy with Maya, with Rhea because she wants her marriage to work but is also trying to provide a certain lifestyle for her family. With Maya we sympathize because she is lonely and misunderstood, and finally with Rishi because he so deparately loves Maya and wants it to be reciprocated. What I liked is all characters had a part in the deterioration of their marriage. There is no one bad guy who we can put all the blame on, every character has to take a share, and every character realizes their role in this destruction. As an audience there is equal share of anger for all characters, as well as sympathy for all. An example, we have anger for Dev and Maya for toying with their spouses emotions to make each other jealous during the theater scene. But sympathy when Dev and Maya are forced to leave their homes when their spouses find out about the affair. We also have anger for Rhea because she is not there for her son or husband because she is working, sympathy when she finds out about the affair and is crying in Dev's mothers arms. Anger for Rishi because he pushes Maya past her comfort zone and pressures her into feeling guilty about a lack of intamacy. Sympathy for him when he is crying asking Maya why she did this to him when he learns of the affair.Karan did a wonderful job portraying such a serious topic on screen with dignity, grace, and a little humor. It is a fantastic movie that makes you think when it's over. I highly recommend it.",5,A Unique Movie for Bollywood,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,5977,"['believe', 'be', 'one', 'Karan', 'Johar', 'best', 'productions', 'Here', 'why', 'First', 'synopsis',

1027551,A1K9KNLTSJF7Q9,B000JKO8KE,Daiho,"[5, 9]","The latest from Bollywood's biggest producer/director, Karan Johar, who once again assembles a stellar cast - Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan Rani Mukerji, Preity Zinta, & Abhishek Bachchan - only to waste them on a dog of a story. As with most Bollywood productions, the film is built around a romance, but this time the protagonists are already married and must suffer - along with audience - boat-fulls of angst before their love can blossom.The biggest problem with the film is that the audience can't sympathize with the protagonists or their predicament.  We never really care what happens to Shah Rukh, who acts more selfish and petulant than the children to whom he acts as soccer coach, and Rani is so overly-sensitive that the least hint of criticism or suspicion causes her to burst into tears. Too many times during this film I found myself wishing that the two would get on with it, run away, and end this mess of a film.The Indian public ate it up - as did overseas audiences. KANK became the biggest grossing Indian film in Europe and America, beating out Johar's much better 2001 release, Khubi Kushi Kabhi Kham.About the only thing this film has going for it is the music, a nice collection of genre pieces, including a love ballad (Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna), a pop-rock anthem (Mitwa), and a techno dance number (Where's the Party Tonight?).

1027554,AZUPF431ILUIH,B000JKO8KE,"FLY QUEEN ""Ace Shopper""","[0, 2]","This is a very good movie, but the ending could have been written better.The story is 2 women are married to the wrong men. They should have switched husbands, and the Father knew that.The women knew they had the wrong husbands,and the husbands knew they were not making it with their wives. One husband loved to dance and party all the time,and the other wife did also. The other husband was quiet and did not like allthat partying and the other wife was the same.The wives knew that they had the wrong partner, and they should have talked anddecided to tell the husbands and decide that they needed to marry the other husband.But, they did not have the courage to do so, so they struggled.Eventually, the two quiet ones got together and fell in love, and finally broke up both marriages. It was a mess and a struggle to get it done. It could have been written much better.The wife who was married to her brother (I'll explain)should have gone to the father and told him. He was cool and very insightful. He could read the signs when no onewas talking about it.  Then they should have divorced, and then married the opposite husband. Then it would have been perfect. But the writer took it thru some terrible struggles and pain and heartaches. The Father told the daughter on his death bed to divorce his son.Now, in India rules are really strange. One couple with the Father-the wife was the Father's daughter; Her family was dead and they took her in and he had the son.They don't call it adopted, but that's what she was. She married his son because hepromised her to him, but they were not blood. So he married his adopted sister. HmmmHowever, in the end, the partying husband finally remarried after 3 years, and askedhis ex-wife to be his 'best man' at his wedding. She agreed, but he then found outwhere the other husband lived, who his ex-wife fell in love with, and told her to go and get him before he leaves for London, so she can be happy in life and love too.He was a nice guy after all the mess. She ran to the train station and found himbut he was ducking her...he saw her first...and he ducked her.  That was stupid,did not make any sense to me. If he was so in love with her, and still in lovewith her, then why would he not be glad to see her and embrace her, but he ran.They crossed paths right in front of each other and she did not see him, buthe saw her.She finally caught him on the train...and the train was pulling off. She calledhis name looking in his face thru the window on the train, and he just sat there. Stupid. The train finally left, and she knew she had lost him forever, and couldnot under-stand why he would not react to seeing her, just stared, dumb looking.She walked feeling hopeless and knew she had lost the love of her life; but hedid get off...he walked up behind her and called her name.  They were finally reunited in their love, that started the whole breaking up of two marriages.But the writer could have written it that they divorced and married the other's husband.  That would have been a more exciting, entertaining, funny & fittingending to that problem, because they were married to the wrong guys and theyneed to switch partners.

Gardner,"[2, 4]","I'll admit that I am obsessed with Shah Rukh Khan, with Amitabh Bachchan, and with Karan Johar movies (even in all their melodramatic weepiness).  I went to this film on opening night, fully anticipating enjoying myself completely and perhaps sniffling embarrassingly in the dark.  Neither happened, and instead, I ended up feeling very disappointed by this film.KANK is a story of two failing marriages that involve two damaged individuals:  Dev (Shah Rukh Khan), an athlete who becomes bitter after a career ending injury, and Maya (Rani Mukherjee), an infertile woman in a loveless and abusive marriage with her childhood buddy.  Dev and Maya find solace in each other, and find more meaning in their relationship with each other than with their respective spouses.Why I didn't like this movie:  Adultery has never been a compelling or sympathetic story line for me, and consequently I found it difficult to care about the characters or the ending of this story.  The acting was also less impressive than I had hoped.  The main characters seemed to lack depth, and were defined only by one or two negative traits (anger, pride, etc.) and their one-dimensional relationships with one another.  Also, the song/dance numbers were somehow lacking.  The color schemes were generally beautiful, but the music was just above so-so and Rani Mukherjee's makeup (something I almost never notice) was so awful that it was distracting.Despite being nominated for eleven Filmfare awards (sort of like an Indian Oscar), KANK only won in one category.

1027557,A2UJG6T6DOWKQF,B000JKO8KE,Jennifer Hopfinger,"[1, 1]","Director Karan Johar has built a wildly successful career making movies about Indians living in the West. Non-resident Indians, as they're called, are a lucrative foreign box-office market (Indians are the wealthiest ethnic group in the U.S.) and films about them are a significant Bollywood subgenre. Johar has his finger on the pulse of the privileged and he's expert at scrutinizing their emotional lives. For all their trendy clothes and cool jobs and swanky homes, they struggle--at least personally.Johar's films sometimes focus on the difficulties of maintaining an Indian identity in another culture, but in 'Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna,' the ethnicity of the Indian characters living in New York City is incidental, and so is their wealth. The story revolves around two unhappily married couples seeking the only thing they don't possess: love.Dev (played by Shahrukh Khan) is a professional soccer player who becomes a stay-at-home dad to his nine-year-old son, Arjun, after a career-ending injury. Dev's wife Rhea (Preity Zinta) is an ambitious, hard-working editor at a fashion magazine. Bitter about his injury and resentful of his wife's success, Dev feels emasculated--and he takes out his frustration on his sensitive son who would rather be a violinist than an athlete. Maya (Rani Mukerji) is a regimented schoolteacher who's married to--and thoroughly annoyed by--Rishi (Abhishek Bachchan), a fun-loving events planner. Dev and Maya both settled for comfortable, passionless marriages--based on friendship but no shared interests--shortchanging their spouses who want more. Whatever contentment they may have started with has given way to constant bickering. On the surface, Rhea and Rishi seem like ideal spouses--attractive, successful, and in love with their partners--but behind closed doors, Rhea is neglectful and condescending and Rishi is childish and passive aggressive. Dev and Maya, on the other hand, are overtly difficult people: he's a prickly misanthrope; she's a clean freak and a homebody. All four actors make these characters immensely engaging, despite their disagreeable traits.Dev and Maya become friends thinking they can give each other the moral support they need to save their marriages, but they come alive only when they're together, and they understand and accept each other's quirks in a way their spouses don't. Their deepening involvement plays out against a stunning backdrop of New York landmarks, including the Brooklyn Bridge, Grand Central Station, Central Park, Washington Square, St. Patrick's Cathedral, and Columbia University.Rishi's father Sam (Amitabh Bachchan), a lothario who beds women young enough to be his granddaughters, develops a warm connection with a woman his own age when he befriends Dev's mother, Kamaljit (Kirron Kher), and the two conspire to help their kids' marriages.Despite its over-the-top moments (the minor non-Indian characters are excessively buffoonish for comic effect), the film treats the tough topic of adultery with frankness and resonates with feeling. - The Bollywood Ticket (Subscribe:The Bollywood Ticket)",5,Must See,1257984000,"11 12, 2009",2009,3098,"['Director', 'Karan', 'Johar', 'built', 'wildly', 'successful', 'career', 'making', 'movies', 'Indians', 'living', 'West', 'Non-resident', 'Indians', ""'re"", 'called', 'are', 'lucrative', 'foreign', 'box-office', 'market', 'Indians', 'are', 'wealthiest', 'ethnic', 'group', 'U.S.', 'films', 'are', 'significant', 'Bollywood', 'subgenre', 'Johar', 'finger', 'pulse', 'privileged', 'expert', 'scrutinizing', 'emotional', 'lives', 'trendy', 'clothes', 'cool', 'jobs', 'swanky', 'homes', 'struggle', 'least', 'personally.Johar', 'films', 'sometimes', 'focus', 'difficulties', 'maintaining', 'Indian', 'identity', 'culture', ""'Kabhi"", 'Alvida', 'Naa', 'Kehna', 'ethnicity', 'Indian', 'characters', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'incidental', 'so', 'wealth', 'story', 'around', 'two', 'unhappily', 'married', 'couples', 'seeking', 'only', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'possess', 'love.Dev', 'played', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'professional', 'soccer', 'player', 'who', 'stay-at-home', 'dad', 'nine-year-old', 'son', 'Arjun', 'career-ending', 'injury', 'Dev', 'wife', 'Rhea', 'Preity', 'Zinta', 'ambitious', 'hard-working', 'editor', 'fashion', 'magazine', 'Bitter', 'injury', 'resentful', 'wife', 'success', 'Dev', 'emasculated', 'out', 'frustration', 'sensitive', 'son', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'violinist', 'athlete', 'Maya', 'Rani', 'Mukerji', 'regimented', 'schoolteacher', 'who', 'married', 'thoroughly', 'annoyed', 'Rishi', 'Abhishek', 'Bachchan', 'fun-loving', 'events', 'planner', 'Dev', 'Maya', 'settled', 'comfortable', 'passionless', 'marriages', 'based', 'friendship', 'shared', 'interests', 'shortchanging', 'spouses', 'who', 'want', 'more', 'contentment', 'may', 'have', 'started', 'given', 'way', 'constant', 'bickering', 'surface', 'Rhea', 'Rishi', 'seem', 'ideal', 'spouses', 'attractive', 'successful', 'love', 'partners', 'closed', 'doors', 'Rhea', 'neglectful', 'condescending', 'Rishi', 'childish', 'passive', 'aggressive', 'Dev', 'Maya', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'overtly', 'difficult', 'people', 'prickly', 'misanthrope', 'clean', 'freak', 'homebody', 'four', 'actors', 'make', 'characters', 'immensely', 'engaging', 'disagreeable', 'traits.Dev', 'Maya', 'become', 'friends', 'thinking', 'can', 'give', 'other', 'moral', 'support', 'need', 'save', 'marriages', 'come', 'alive', 'only', 'when', ""'re"", 'together', 'understand', 'accept', 'other', 'quirks', 'way', 'spouses', 'do', ""n't"", 'Their', 'deepening', 'involvement', 'out', 'stunning', 'backdrop', 'New', 'York', 'landmarks', 'including', 'Brooklyn', 'Bridge', 'Grand', 'Central', 'Station', 'Central', 'Park', 'Washington', 'Square', 'St.', 'Patrick', 'Cathedral', 'Columbia', 'University.Rishi', 'father', 'Sam', 'Amitabh', 'Bachchan', 'lothario', 'who', 'women', 'young', 'enough', 'be', 'granddaughters', 'warm', 'connection', 'woman', 'own', 'age', 'when', 'Dev', 'mother', 'Kamaljit', 'Kirron', 'Kher', 'two', 'conspire', 'help', 'kids', 'marriages.Despite', 'over-the-top', 'moments', 'minor', 'non-Indian', 'characters', 'are', 'excessively', 'buffoonish', 'comic', 'effect', 'film', 'tough', 'topic', 'adultery', 'frankness', 'feeling', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket', 'Subscribe', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket']",Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna

For all fans, in this movie there is everything we long for: beautiful actors, magnificent dresses and settings, fantastic and catchy music, good sentiments and the old fashion ethics by which many still live and especially the time span (nearly three hours) that it takes to get to know your characters and your story.The director Karan Johar has a great talent at directing teary but convincing stories (all titles with four words starting with a ""K"" like for example Kal Ho Na Ho) and for this movie he called together Indian greatest stars: Sharuk Khan as Dev, Rani Mukherjee as Maya, Abishek Bachchan as Rishi, Preiti Zinta as Rhea, Amitabh Bachchan as Sam and Kiron Kher as Dev's mom.This is the story of Dev and Maya, two strangers that meet on a bench the day of Maya's non convinced marriage to Rishi, her childhood friend. Dev who is a successful football player, already partially critical of his marriage, convinces Maya to marry even if dubious and states that love won't come up after marriage if you don't look for it. The two separate looking back on each other. Unfortunately Dev has an accident and must renounce his football career, he becomes economically dependent from his ambitious and successful wife Rhea and develops a destructive anger against the whole world.After four years in curious circumstances (an hypothetical hysteria on a criminal that kidnaps children the ""Black Beast"" - and I must say this part is almost ridiculous-) Dev and Maya meet again introducing their respective partners. Maya is a frustrated, frigid, wife devoted to cleaning the house, she seems like atrophied by the lack of love. Dev immediately realizes her problem and starts getting under her skin with his provocative character. Since the two realize that their marriages are in crisis they decide to become friends in the attempt to solve their problems. But, as expected, they fall in love truly knowing each others defects and drawbacks, while the rest of their worlds keep on going on as if nothing is happening and their spouses come to believe in ""return of flame"". However, love leads to jealousy and this must be accompanied by possess and the couple can only ""come out"", leading to many a complication.It will take years before the situation settles down and Dev, Maya, Rhea and Rishi can finally find their peace.The viewer's attention is drawn mostly on sarcastic and lovable underdog Dev and teary, undecided but consistent Maya, but their spouses Rhea and Rishi also have important personalities. Preity and Abishek Bachchan are very good in their roles, maybe better than the leading couple. Amitabh Bachchan plays Rishi's fater in an ambiguous role of an aspirant Hugh Heffner that however longs for his long dead wife declaring his philosophy of ""carpe diem"". Dev and Rhea also have a son, that lives in a conflictive situation with his difficult parents even if he is greatly loved. I found this part of the movie very human and deep.This movie has been either loved or hated, greatly criticized for the lack of motivation of the characters, the sometimes ridiculous situations portrayed (but it takes a lot of acting to fill up three hours), the repetitiveness of the scenes (NYC and the rail station and the scenes under the bridge), but on the whole it does deal with real life situations in an evolving society (especially the Indian society that takes abroad many of its traditions such as combined marriage) and the actors ""become"" the people the portray.

(Every scene where they meet up in public or private has me cringing in my seat, wondering if someone is going to catch them in the act.)Maybe that makes me biased, but to this day I don't understand the concept of a person who's married, that goes and commits adultery because they are unhappy in their marriage.To make it worse, I have no clue why a person cheats when their spouse loves them wholeheartedly and would do anything to prove it.This is basically what the premise of the movie is about. If you can stomach scenarios like these and watch it for over two hours, then this is the movie for you. If not, I suggest ""Chalte Chalte (Shahrukh Kahn, Rani Mukherjee)"" or ""Kuch Naa Kaho (Aishwarya Rai, Abishek Bachchan)"" and better yet,my absolute favorite ""Kal Ho Naa Ho (Sharukh Khan, Preity Zinta).""This movie shows the ugly side of marriage and the journey of two married ""friends"" who divulge deeper and deeper into a close relationship, thinking that this ""friendship"" wouldn't go to far. Unfortunately it did.Its sad, its heartbreaking, and extremely unfair how people rationalize their feelings and think its okay to play out of bounds in their marriage. Its a Hindi film I never thought I'd see, but its a whole new frontier in Bollywood these years.

1027566,A290A3XO7XK33X,B000JKO8KE,Prominence,"[2, 3]","Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (KANK) is quite a thought provoking movie. It's very much different from the conventional Bollywood cinema. I had reservations about this movie at first because most of the reviews I saw were more focused on the star cast and NYC location than the substance of the movie. Having seen the movie, I'm glad I did.KANK is the tale of two people Dev and Maya (Shah Rukh Khan and Rani Mukherji) who become friends in an attempt to save their failing marriages. Dev is married to his friend out of college, Rhea (Preity Zinta) and Maya is married to her childhood friend (Abhiseck Bachchan). Dev meets Maya by chance on her wedding day while she was having cold feet. He convinces her to go ahead with the marriage as she may have to wait for the rest of her life for Mr. Right who may never show up.Both go their separate ways only to meet four years later by chance...again. This time a lot has changed. Both their marriages are heading for the rocks. Dev's situation is made worse because his football career is on hold due to a knee injury while his wife's career is soaring; thereby relegating him to the position of the dependant. Maya's situation is made worse because she is unable to have kids. She feels no spark for her husband plus he won't stop acting like the spoiled kid he is.At first, both Dev and Maya only poke fun at how miserable the others life is in their marriages. It wasn't until Sam (Amitahb Bachchan) made an innocent comment about being friends with Dev's mother (Kiron Kher) because they've been through the same things thereby understand each other better that both Dev and Maya decide to use the excuse of marital dissatisfaction to be closer together. I suppose this is the point another question is raised. Can an adult male and female be purely friends without letting anything sexual mar the relationship? Did they cross the sexual boundaries or not? What were their spouses' reactions to the friendship? Was separation/divorce an issue? I suppose I'll let you find out in the movie.The high points for this movie come from the way the script was woven to keep you wondering if they will ever make the decision to go all the way or not. Also from making a fine point between what society expects and what happens in reality.All the actors did well portraying the different characters but I got the most kicks from watching Amitahb as the guy after anything in skirt. The idea of having him check out Kiron Kher was really adorable. I suppose this is where I have to disagree with the previous reviewer about the director splashing a serious issue with frivolous jokes. I honestly think the comic relieve helped the tone of the movie a lot. Being that majority of the Bollywood cinema audience find the concept that weaves this movie together unconventional, I think the script writer did well to introduce the jokes however subtle to lessen the audience aversion for some of the twists in the movie altogether.I also think Rani Mukherji stole the show. Portraying the woman who loves two guys a lot, but in different ways was very well done and I don't think anyone else could have pulled it off better. Plus I've seen her in quite a few movies but I never reeeally looked at her until now. Good Lord! Is she gorgeous or what?

1027567,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B000JKO8KE,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[3, 3]","You can never go wrong with watching a Yash Raj film.  Yash Rah films have always been recognized as the films with the largest budgets, the most popular actors and actresses, and the most colorful scenes throughout the film.In this film ""Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna"", it is filmed in New York.  It's interesting how such a dirty city could look so good in High Definition.  Now check out this cast:  This film has Shah Rukh Khan, Abitabh Bachchan, Rani Mukherji, Prity Zinta, Abhishek Bachchan, and Arjun Rampal. Just to name a few.  There hasn't been this many big names all in one movie since Yash Raj's ""Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham.""  But, this movie does address two failing marriages with the starting of a new relationship of two unhappily married people. I love Rani Mukherji, but I don't understand why she was so resistant in her marriage to her husband who definitely shows a more loving interest in his wife.  Shah Ruhn Khan's role in the movie seems bitter and mean.  He's terrible as a father to his son whom he seems to ""scare to death!"" So, some of the character behavior of these actors and actresses that I generally love, have rather disappointed me in this movie.But, I generally watch a Bollywood film because I love to watch good looking people on film.  A good story is only secondary as my intention to be entertained.If you an English speaking American, and are new to Bollywood films, let me give you a breakdown of how I interpret and ingest the Bollywood experience:First of all, you will most always be reading English subtitles.The average Bollywood film is about 3 hours long.Bollywood films are very colorful.  All their beautiful fashion, and colorful dance floors. In High Definition, just the sceneries alone make you appreciate what High Definition is all about.About 30 percent of the film will be music videos (with Yash Raj films, it's more like about 45 percent). I personally wish there were less music videos if the movie is already over three hours long.About 30 percent of most Bollywood films have some rather silly, really unfunny, and downright annoying comedy scenes (which is usually in the first half of the film), then the film will start to become more serious, as it moves along.One of the main reasons why you will watch a Bollywood film, is because you already chose to fall in love with one of their many beautiful actresses, or handsome actors. (I personally try to see all Rani Mukherji films, and Shah Rukh Khan is the one actor known to be one of the biggest box office sellers of Bollywood.)So, I guess I can honestly say that I have about 10 Blu-Ray Bollywood films which about 7 of them are Yash Raj releases. Thouugh I have about 100 Bollywood films on DVD, all I really care to get on Blu-Ray now is ""Lagaan"" which was the first Bollywood film that I saw about 10 years ago.  And perhaps ""Mann"" with Aamir Khan, and ""Rangeela"" which stars the enchanting Urmila Matondkar.  Oh, and I guess it would be truly appreciated if ""Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai"" starring Amisha Patel and Hrithik Roshan would ever be released in High Definition Blu-Ray.  The scenes in India and New Zealand were all just so beautiful on the screen.Another good movie that I would like to recommend, that is not a Yash Raj film, but is available on Blu-Ray is ""Ghulam"" starring Rani Mukherji and Aamir Khan.  Even all the song videos in this film are all truly appreciated, and the added humor isn't so annoying.

1027568,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B000JKO8KE,Shashank Tripathi,"[14, 19]","Such an inordinate number of successful Bollywood films seem to tread the jaded lines of one geometric shape, the triangle--Kuchh Kucch Hota Hai, Dil To Paagal Hai, Saajan, Kal Ho Na Ho, Parineeta, ad infinitum--that one could be forgiven for wanting to hand the industry a Camlin compass box.Not to worry. Karan Johar, the under-30 Star Director (as they'll have you believe) rips through the shackles of that well-established formula, and offers us this putative ""breakthrough"" film: a quadrilaterial! Four lead actors, you see, caught ever so helplessly in the web of extra-marital flexibilities. A smart, savvy, young theme, one that showcases the intricacies and challenges of an India of the future.Right. I hate to prick the bubble, but this flapdoodle is anything but. Notwithstanding the familiar picnics that we've seen in Sooraj Barjatya flicks (polygons?), KANK's problem is not with the moral indignations that ultra-conservatives may have with its theme. Sure, attractions beyond ill-conceived and hastily-arranged marriages are a reality. Who, having enjoyed an orange, would nevermore want an apple?But where the film comes up short, very short, is in its sheer lack of sensibility with the subject matter for grown-ups. Like a lumpy soup in a cheap restaurant where the chef couldn't decide quite how much to put in, of what, KANK never quite makes up its mind about being a sincere film exploring a sincere theme, or a mass market slapstick, leaping instead from the frivolous to the utterly idiotic.We see a couple of couples make what we're supposed to believe is an honest endeavor at a platonic relationship. A When-Harry-Met-Sally exploration of male-female bonds ensues. Love gratified is love satisfied, and love satisfied is indifference begun. But only the married folk in this fairy tale complete that circle, not these well-meaning friends with their thinly-veiled flirtations.The editing doesn't help either. As the story meanders through the needless song and aerobics, Rani and Abhishek are probably the only two that carry their roles with a semblance of sanity. Big B looks like a buffoon, but he seems to have been working hard at it for a couple of years, so I suppose we must say he's successful. Shahrukh seems to continue to win accolades for his hammy prattle, which ceased to be charming quite a while ago, and is only more egregious in this self-same installment. Kiran Kher joins the jamboree for the sole purpose of bringing sobriety to an erratic old man by oh-so-coyly calling him ""boyfriend"" (imagine the middle-aged aunties in the audience swooning over in giggles), and because that were clearly not enough, she also manages to bag a couple of gaffes celebrating her derriere from Jullundur.Bollywood's fascination with New York--the most usual suspect among ""foreign cities"", after London--continues, with just the kind of bromides we have seen in numerous previous attempts. A cavalcade of overcoats is obligatory (what a uni-seasonal city NY must be) and the Johar version of New York lives, breathes, sleeps in eternal perpetuity right by the Hudson river, because, clearly, that's where everything happens.For viewers/reviewers gushing with praise because they ""truly saw moments from their lives embedded into this film"", may I recommend a healthy dose of some of our own gems -- Ijaazat,Silsila, Kaash, Arth,Kabhi Kabhie, Saath Saath (for a dash of the light-hearted), Seema (with Balraj Sahni) and so forth -- where similar themes have been handled with the kind of grace and cadence that the subject calls for, and heck, deserves. If one is truly inclined to expand one's perspective and savor more intelligent films about the cobweb of relationships, I wholeheartedly recommend the likes ofThe Ice Storm,Eat Drink Man Woman,We Don't Live Here Anymore,Lost in Translation,Heat and Dust,An Ideal Husband, American Beauty,Dangerous Liaisons. And so on.Barring thesoundtrack, which has some hummable melodies, the discerning may do well to skip this three-hour non-entertainment. It is not a breakthrough. It is certainly not a New Experiment. It's a mawkish popcorn thing that's made to appeal to the masses and to overworked engineers named Hari Prasad.",1,A QUADRILATERAL AT LAST!,1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,4210,"['Such', 'inordinate', 'number', 'successful', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'seem', 'tread', 'jaded', 'lines', 'one', 'geometric', 'shape', 'triangle', 'Kuchh', 'Kucch', 'Hota', 'Hai', 'Dil', 'Paagal', 'Hai', 'Saajan', 'Kal', 'Ho', 'Na', 'Ho', 'Parineeta', 'ad', 'infinitum', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'forgiven', 'wanting', 'hand', 'industry', 'Camlin', 'compass', 'box.Not', 'worry', 'Karan', 'Johar', 'under-30', 'Star', 'Director', ""'ll"", 'have', 'believe', 'shackles', 'well-established', 'formula', 'putative', 'breakthrough', 'film', 'quadrilaterial', 'Four', 'lead', 'actors', 'see', 'caught', 'ever', 'so', 'helplessly', 'web', 'extra-marital', 'flexibilities', 'smart', 'savvy', 'young', 'theme', 'one', 'intricacies', 'challenges', 'India', 'future.Right', 'hate', 'prick', 'bubble', 'flapdoodle', 'anything', 'Notwithstanding', 'familiar', 'picnics', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Sooraj', 'Barjatya', 'flicks', 'polygons', 'KANK', 'problem', 'not', 'moral', 'indignations', 'ultra-conservatives', 'may', 'have', 'theme', 'Sure', 'attractions', 'ill-conceived', 'hastily-arranged', 'marriages', 'are', 'reality', 'Who', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'orange', 'would', 'nevermore', 'want', 'apple', 'where', 'film', 'up', 'short', 'very', 'short', 'sheer', 'lack', 'sensibility', 'subject', 'matter', 'grown-ups', 'lumpy', 'soup', 'cheap', 'restaurant', 'where', 'chef', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'quite', 'how', 'much', 'put', 'what', 'KANK', 'never', 'quite', 'up', 'mind', 'being', 'sincere', 'film', 'exploring', 'sincere', 'theme', 'mass', 'market', 'slapstick', 'leaping', 'instead', 'frivolous', 'utterly', 'idiotic.We', 'see', 'couple', 'couples', 'make', 'what', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'honest', 'endeavor', 'platonic', 'relationship', 'When-Harry-Met-Sally', 'exploration', 'male-female', 'bonds', 'ensues', 'Love', 'gratified', 'love', 'satisfied', 'love', 'satisfied', 'indifference', 'begun', 'only', 'married', 'folk', 'fairy', 'tale', 'complete', 'circle', 'not', 'well-meaning', 'friends', 'thinly-veiled', 'flirtations.The', 'editing', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'story', 'meanders', 'needless', 'song', 'aerobics', 'Rani', 'Abhishek', 'are', 'probably', 'only', 'two', 'carry', 'roles', 'semblance', 'sanity', 'Big', 'B', 'buffoon', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'hard', 'couple', 'years', 'suppose', 'must', 'say', 'successful', 'Shahrukh', 'continue', 'win', 'accolades', 'hammy', 'prattle', 'ceased', 'be', 'charming', 'quite', 'while', 'ago', 'only', 'more', 'egregious', 'self-same', 'installment', 'Kiran', 'Kher', 'jamboree', 'sole', 'purpose', 'bringing', 'sobriety', 'erratic', 'old', 'man', 'oh-so-coyly', 'calling', 'boyfriend', 'imagine', 'middle-aged', 'aunties', 'audience', 'swooning', 'giggles', 'were', 'clearly', 'not', 'enough', 'also', 'bag', 'couple', 'gaffes', 'celebrating', 'derriere', 'Jullundur.Bollywood', 'fascination', 'New', 'York', 'most', 'usual', 'suspect', 'foreign', 'cities', 'London', 'just', 'kind', 'bromides', 'have', 'seen', 'numerous', 'previous', 'attempts', 'cavalcade', 'overcoats', 'obligatory', 'what', 'uni-seasonal', 'city', 'NY', 'must', 'be', 'Johar', 'version', 'New', 'York', 'breathes', 'sleeps', 'eternal', 'perpetuity', 'right', 'Hudson', 'river', 'clearly', 'where', 'everything', 'happens.For', 'viewers/reviewers', 'gushing', 'praise', 'truly', 'saw', 'moments', 'lives', 'embedded', 'film', 'may', 'recommend', 'healthy', 'dose', 'own', 'gems', 'Ijaazat', 'Silsila', 'Kaash', 'Arth', 'Kabhi', 'Kabhie', 'Saath', 'Saath', 'dash', 'light-hearted', 'Seema', 'Balraj', 'Sahni', 'so', 'forth', 'where', 'similar', 'themes', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'kind', 'grace', 'cadence', 'subject', 'heck', 'deserves', 'one', 'truly', 'inclined', 'expand', 'one', 'perspective', 'savor', 'more', 'intelligent', 'films', 'cobweb', 'relationships', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'likes', 'ofThe', 'Ice', 'Storm', 'Eat', 'Drink', 'Man', 'Woman', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'Heat', 'Dust', 'Ideal', 'Husband', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Dangerous', 'Liaisons', 'so', 'on.Barring', 'thesoundtrack', 'hummable', 'melodies', 'discerning', 'may', 'do', 'well', 'skip', 'three-hour', 'non-entertainment', 'not', 'breakthrough', 'certainly', 'not', 'New', 'Experiment', 'mawkish', 'popcorn', 'thing', 'made', 'appeal', 'masses', 'overworked', 'engineers', 'named', 'Hari', 'Prasad']",Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna

With dance breaks, of course.*The movie does not end with anyone killing themselves in guilt or someone being shot/stabbed in a jealous rage.*The attractive cast for the most part was stellar in their portrayals of complicated characters that were all infuriatingly flawed yet sympathetic. The NYT review complained that Dev was too morose to be believable as a romantic lead, but I thought the physical and emotional heat between his cranky character and Maya's closed-up soul was pretty clear.*Beautiful picturisations of the songs, with lush colours. ""Where's the Party"", with Dev & Maya making that choice to finally sleep together while their unsuspecting spouses celebrate the ""fixing"" of their marriages was particularly sharp.The things that could have been better:*I got tired of Rani Mukerjhee's tearfests.*The ""black beast"" sub-plot was completely unneccessary.So I recommend this movie as a contemporary adult Bollywood movie, fairly well-made & acted. Watch it and argue about the ""morals"" with a friend!",4,Unusual Bollywood Movie,1168819200,"01 15, 2007",2007,1376,"['was', 'curious', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'New', 'York', 'unconventional', 'plot', 'ended', 'up', 'really', 'liking', 'several', 'reasons', '*The', 'unflinching', 'portrayal', 'marriages', 'become', 'tangled', 'not', 'just', 'illicit', 'desire', 'petty', 'disappointments', 'everyday', 'life', 'odd', 'compare', 'French', 'film', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'novel', 'dance', 'breaks', 'course', '*The', 'movie', 'not', 'end', 'anyone', 'killing', 'guilt', 'someone', 'being', 'shot/stabbed', 'jealous', 'rage', '*The', 'attractive', 'cast', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'stellar', 'portrayals', 'complicated', 'characters', 'were', 'infuriatingly', 'flawed', 'yet', 'sympathetic', 'NYT', 'review', 'complained', 'Dev', 'was', 'too', 'morose', 'be', 'believable', 'romantic', 'lead', 'thought', 'physical', 'emotional', 'heat', 'cranky', 'character', 'Maya', 'closed-up', 'soul', 'was', 'pretty', 'clear', '*Beautiful', 'picturisations', 'songs', 'lush', 'colours', 'Where', 'Party', 'Dev', 'Maya', 'making', 'choice', 'finally', 'sleep', 'together', 'unsuspecting', 'spouses', 'celebrate', 'fixing', 'marriages', 'was', 'particularly', 'sharp.The', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', '*I', 'got', 'tired', 'Rani', 'Mukerjhee', 'tearfests', '*The', 'black', 'beast', 'sub-plot', 'was', 'completely', 'unneccessary.So', 'recommend', 'movie', 'contemporary', 'adult', 'Bollywood', 'movie', 'fairly', 'well-made', 'acted', 'Watch', 'argue', 'morals', 'friend']",Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna
1027570,A1FZHLJHSGT4DN,B000JKO8KE,"TERE ""TERE""","[0, 0]","This was such a wonderful film. I was not sure I would like the ending but I was pleasantly surprised. Shah Rukh Khan is amazing as always. Such a nice change from some Hollywood Movies that lately seem to get more and more ridiculous. This movie had a great cast, story and music. I didn't want it to end.  I felt bad for all the main characters involved until the end. I hope bollywood keeps making movies like this and Hollywood could learn a thing or two from bollywwood, its actors, directors and stories. I don't agree with adultery either as some stated here in the reviews but I forgave these characters in the film because of their unhappiness in their marriages and they did not mean to hurt their spouses but when you are unhappy in your marriage and can't work things out no matter how much you try and without meaning to fall in love with someone else well then you know the marriage is over. Personally speaking I am so glad for divorces because sometimes it's better to be alone and happy than live with someone who makes you miserable. Or be with someone you don't love and can't be with the one you do love.",5,WOW! what a Great film!,1379376000,"09 17, 2013",2013,1124,"['was', 'such', 'wonderful', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'like', 'ending', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'amazing', 'always', 'Such', 'nice', 'change', 'Hollywood', 'Movies', 'lately', 'seem', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'had', 'great', 'cast', 'story', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'end', 'felt', 'bad', 'main', 'characters', 'involved', 'end', 'hope', 'bollywood', 'keeps', 'making', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'learn', 'thing', 'two', 'bollywwood', 'actors', 'directors', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'adultery', 'stated', 'here', 'reviews', 'forgave', 'characters', 'film', 'unhappiness', 'marriages', 'did', 'not', 'mean', 'hurt', 'spouses', 'when', 'are', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'ca', ""n't"", 'work', 'things', 'out', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'try', 'meaning', 'fall', 'love', 'someone', 'else', 'well', 'then', 'know', 'marriage', 'Personally', 'speaking', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'divorces', 'because', 'better', 'be', 'alone', 'happy', 'live', 'someone', 'who', 'miserable', 'be', 'someone', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'one', 'do', 'love']",Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna
