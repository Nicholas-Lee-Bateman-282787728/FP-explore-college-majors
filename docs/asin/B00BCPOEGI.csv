1625606,A2V12SVGIKWVFP,B00BCPOEGI,Brendan Riley,"[4, 5]","this one didn't seem as good. It felt like there were fewer action scenes and more focus on character development. That may seem odd, because, who doesn't want character development? I sure like my characters fully rounded. What I mean by this is that the balance between action and character development that was present in the first series was off in this one.It is also important to keep in mind that before you watch this second series, please note that this comes with the OVAs as well. These, in my opinion, must be watched first before the actual season is watched. They are kind of like a prequel that gives a frame of reference for the second season. Be warned, though, the OVAs are MUCH different from the first and even the second series as it is nearly all character development (with a love story..I think..maybe?).Once I understood everything, this was a great second season. Again, much different from the first season, but not necessarily in a bad way. Just different. One complaint though. The girl, Suo (I don't know if that's how you spell it or not, and frankly don't care; you'll know who I mean when you watch it) has the power to generate, from her body, an anti-tank sniper rifle. That's cool. That's unique. None of the X-Men ever had anything like that. However, I don't want to see her ""conjure"" it out of her body every time she uses it! Talk about an unnecessary time killer!Other than that, I highly recommend this second season to those who have seen the first and wish it didn't end when it did.",4,"Loved The First One, but...",1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,1527,"['one', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'good', 'felt', 'were', 'fewer', 'action', 'scenes', 'more', 'focus', 'character', 'development', 'may', 'seem', 'odd', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'character', 'development', 'sure', 'characters', 'fully', 'rounded', 'What', 'mean', 'balance', 'action', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'present', 'first', 'series', 'was', 'off', 'one.It', 'also', 'important', 'keep', 'mind', 'watch', 'second', 'series', 'please', 'note', 'OVAs', 'as', 'well', 'opinion', 'must', 'be', 'watched', 'first', 'actual', 'season', 'watched', 'are', 'kind', 'prequel', 'frame', 'reference', 'second', 'season', 'Be', 'warned', 'OVAs', 'are', 'MUCH', 'different', 'first', 'even', 'second', 'series', 'nearly', 'character', 'development', 'love', 'story..I', 'think..maybe', '.Once', 'understood', 'everything', 'was', 'great', 'second', 'season', 'Again', 'much', 'different', 'first', 'season', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'way', 'Just', 'different', 'One', 'complaint', 'girl', 'Suo', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'spell', 'not', 'frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', ""'ll"", 'know', 'who', 'mean', 'when', 'watch', 'power', 'generate', 'body', 'anti-tank', 'sniper', 'rifle', 'cool', 'unique', 'None', 'X-Men', 'ever', 'had', 'anything', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'conjure', 'body', 'time', 'Talk', 'unnecessary', 'time', 'killer', 'Other', 'highly', 'recommend', 'second', 'season', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'wish', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'when', 'did']",N/A

1625609,A39TLGEQQVLLG4,B00BCPOEGI,jophy hey,"[0, 0]","This season I watched before the first as recommended by a review I saw on YouTube. Therefore I did not have any idea about the events that took place in the first season. I found that this did not matter, the season felt like a stand alone season, and I was not spoiled the first season when I did watch it.The characters were a little forgettable, and there was a whole lot of action like I was expecting, although when there was a fight it was very good. These two complaints, are not that big a deal though, and are not the main thing that made me give the season three stars. The over all plot and story saved these last two cons from ruining it. Why I am mainly giving this three stars is because it was two short and rushed through it engaging plot.Over all I think this season is good but not worth the money for someone who is not a die hard anime fan.P.S not that this bothered me but, but to me, I fill the ending did not make much since. For some people this might need to be considered before buying.

1625610,A22OD81Z9HYFV1,B00BCPOEGI,Kris,"[7, 7]","The first season of Darker than Black (DTB) was a great noir, drama, comedy, super powered, sci-fi show. Can the second season top the first season? The first season's episodes were almost always two-parters, and then they would move on to another storyline. When you think that that episode didn't contribute to the overall plot, you would be proven wrong later on in the show. The second season is a story based series, rather than episodic. All the episodes are connected like most modern non-comedy anime.This collection is distributed by Funimation, just like the first season, so all reoccurring characters have the same voices. Note that the 13 episodes are listed first on the DVDs, and then the 4 OVA episodes. I originally watched the set in that order, and was very confused because many plot points are explained in the OVAs. The OVA episodes take place before the second season episodes, so be sure to watch them first. The third DVD in the set has all the OVAs, then you can watch disc one and two afterwards. The Blue Ray has the OVAs on the second disc along with the later episodes of the season.This season does feature Hei (aka BK 201) as the main character again, but the series focuses a lot on a young red haired girl named Su Pavlichenko, who gets mixed up with Hei and Mao, the cat from the first season. If you want to know what happened to Yin from the first season, just watch the OVAs and you will understand; she does prove to be an important character in the OVAs and the second season, despite her not being in too many episodes.If you thought that the first season had a lot of unusual characters, coupled with unusual special abilities and unusual payments, then you need to watch this collection. It seems like every time they create a ridiculous power, they top it with an even crazier power, and it is always satisfying to see the characters feel challenged by an even greater threat.The plot grows even more complex in this season, and there are more organizations, and people you are not sure if you should trust along the way. There are a lot of cameos from the first season, and its is always refreshing to see old friends again. Overall, this is a really good series, but be aware that it is even darker than the first season, and most of the series does not even take place in Tokyo, which is also refreshing to see Russia in an anime.",5,Darker than Darker than Black,1381276800,"10 9, 2013",2013,2377,"['first', 'season', 'Darker', 'Black', 'DTB', 'was', 'great', 'noir', 'drama', 'comedy', 'super', 'powered', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'Can', 'second', 'season', 'top', 'first', 'season', 'first', 'season', 'episodes', 'were', 'almost', 'always', 'two-parters', 'then', 'would', 'move', 'storyline', 'When', 'think', 'episode', 'did', ""n't"", 'contribute', 'overall', 'plot', 'would', 'be', 'proven', 'wrong', 'later', 'show', 'second', 'season', 'story', 'based', 'series', 'rather', 'episodic', 'episodes', 'are', 'connected', 'most', 'modern', 'non-comedy', 'anime.This', 'collection', 'distributed', 'Funimation', 'just', 'first', 'season', 'reoccurring', 'characters', 'have', 'same', 'voices', 'Note', '13', 'episodes', 'are', 'listed', 'first', 'DVDs', 'then', '4', 'OVA', 'episodes', 'originally', 'watched', 'set', 'order', 'was', 'very', 'confused', 'many', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'explained', 'OVAs', 'OVA', 'episodes', 'take', 'place', 'second', 'season', 'episodes', 'so', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'first', 'third', 'DVD', 'set', 'OVAs', 'then', 'can', 'watch', 'disc', 'one', 'two', 'afterwards', 'Blue', 'Ray', 'OVAs', 'second', 'disc', 'later', 'episodes', 'season.This', 'season', 'feature', 'Hei', 'aka', 'BK', '201', 'main', 'character', 'again', 'series', 'lot', 'young', 'red', 'haired', 'girl', 'named', 'Su', 'Pavlichenko', 'who', 'mixed', 'up', 'Hei', 'Mao', 'cat', 'first', 'season', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Yin', 'first', 'season', 'just', 'watch', 'OVAs', 'will', 'understand', 'prove', 'be', 'important', 'character', 'OVAs', 'second', 'season', 'not', 'being', 'too', 'many', 'episodes.If', 'thought', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'lot', 'unusual', 'characters', 'coupled', 'unusual', 'special', 'abilities', 'unusual', 'payments', 'then', 'need', 'watch', 'collection', 'time', 'create', 'ridiculous', 'power', 'top', 'even', 'crazier', 'power', 'always', 'satisfying', 'see', 'characters', 'feel', 'challenged', 'even', 'greater', 'threat.The', 'plot', 'even', 'more', 'complex', 'season', 'are', 'more', 'organizations', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'should', 'trust', 'way', 'are', 'lot', 'cameos', 'first', 'season', 'always', 'refreshing', 'see', 'old', 'friends', 'again', 'Overall', 'really', 'good', 'series', 'be', 'aware', 'even', 'darker', 'first', 'season', 'most', 'series', 'not', 'even', 'take', 'place', 'Tokyo', 'also', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Russia', 'anime']",N/A
