428479,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,6304554168,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[0, 1]","Voted for Best Foreign Film in 1997, this Czech film takes place in 1988 thus covering a political backdrop that plays a role.Franta is an elderly bachelor, womanizer, lonely, and has sex with younger women and/or married women.  A cellist, he is no longer with the  Czech  Orchestra, and making ends meet playing funerals.Low on funds, he is finally seduced by money and  is encouraged to enter into a fake marriage to a younger woman.  Although the marriage seems mighty short, the woman leaves, she leaves him with a sweet, tender, 5-year old boy Kolya.Although the outcome is rather predictable, this was a touching story that held the viewer's interest, just to see the bonding between an elderly bachelor, making room and time for a child, a shift in his lifestyle.  Even  though it is predictable, the film holds your interest as the sweet child Kolya opens to his guardian, as Franta becomes attached and must thwart off any police suspicions relating to his fake marriage.This was an amazing child actor.  Not once did you see that he was acting.  Most foreign films have really good child actors, and this is no exception.  Great bonding story!!

One late evening I caught it on TV and started watching.  I became completely engrossed in the film a few minutes later.  I realized my apprehension was due to the fact that I often get annoyed at overly sirupy child actors but Kolya was charming, cute, intelligenbt to the point that I would love to have a son just like him.  The story is simple but captivating.  A bachelor gets involved in a fake marriage to provide legal papers for a pretty russian woman to be naturalized Czech. In the background of the story, communism is coming to an end and mnay Czechs, especially, the bachelor's maother dislike Russians.  This characteristic actually serves to make one of the most toughing and charming scenes of the film as the russian boy meets a troop of Russian soldiers and is reminded of home.  Also in the background is a beautiful soundtrack of classical Czech music - the bachelor is a cellist.Every character is well played and despite the foreign language it's very understandable.  In fact those who are even slightly  familiar with Russian will enjoy the film's mixture of Tussian and Czech languages - shown by italicizing the very good subtitles when Kolya speaks in Russian. In many ways it reminded me of another favoirite film of mine: Cinema Paradiso. After that initial TV introduction I've seen the film many times over and bought the video.",5,Krassavitza!

Everyone gives superb performances but the greatest praise must be for the director Jan Sverak, who always under-plays the drama while at the same time capturing the very best performance the five-year-old Andrei Chalimon, who plays the eponymous Kolya. Other reviewers have summarized the plot - suffice it to say that everything is beautifully balanced and finely presented. The political background of the closing years of the CCCP does not over-shadow the emotional relationship between the two protagonists, but permits the final reconciliation between the boy and the mother who abandoned him for a life in West Germany.There is so much to enjoy in this movie that it merits being watched several times, just as a fine painting merits close and lengthy study.

428485,AACEZE2YPTJ5D,6304554168,D. Kanigan,"[3, 3]","This is a Czech foreign language film set in Prague in the late 80's.  The lead actor, Frantisek Louka, is in his 50's and is an accomplished symphony cellist.  He gets booted off the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra (for some unstated reason) - he struggles to make ends meet and pay his debts by playing music at funerals and restoring gold-leaf on weathered tombstones.  Louka has never been married. In between his part time day jobs, Louka, a charmer, chases married women and cares for his aging Mother.  He is determined to buy a car (a Trabant) but struggles to find the resources to do so - that is, until a friend comes up with a scheme to marry a divorced and beautiful, young Russian woman who is looking to get Czech papers.  After significant reservations, Louka agrees to the scam so he can buy his car and pay off his debts.  No sooner are they married - the woman bolts leaving him to care for her 5 year son.The film lightly touches on the Russian occupation of the country and its impact on the populace.  There are some terrific scenes of when the boy lights up when he sees the Russian military officers and their equipment - and Louka's Mother's reaction who despises the Russians.The charm of this movie is the relationship that develops between Louka, a most reluctant father, and an adorable Russian boy.  Louka comes to care and love the boy and his life is altered from his former selfish and self-centered ways.  Louka is the main attraction and star in this film - playing a gruff, self-centered, talented musician trying to find his way.

Louka (Zdenek Sverak) is a cellist who once played concert halls, and must now work at making a sparse living, playing at the Prague crematorium, during the fall of the Soviet Union, since he has been blacklisted by the Communist government authority.  What's more, a friend of his makes him an offer to acquire a great deal of money in a short amount of time.  He must agree to a sham marriage with a Russian woman (Stella Z&aacute;zvorkov&aacute;).  If this doesn't sound questionable enough, there is another detail to add into the mix.  This woman has a young son, Kolya (Zdenek Sverak) , who speaks no Czech.  Of course, Louka speaks no Russian.  The little boy is dropped off at Louka's modest studio apartment, and the confirmed bachelor who has grown quite set in his ways, must learn to adjust to life with a small child.  Little does he know how much this life change will affect him for the better.KOLYA works very well on several levels.

A man who is either socially withdrawn or recklessly womanising (our hero is somehow both) suddenly has a small child dumped on his doorstep. The child is in some contrived way ""his"" and thus can't be gotten rid of easily. Man at first dislikes child; then child effortlessly changes man's life. Cold heart becomes all warmed up by bundle of cuteness.

Quite an artistic pedigree.The eponymous child in this film is actually an appalling dullard who almost never speaks and scarcely does anything interesting for the duration of the film. So it is a small mercy that a third of the movie is over before the boy makes his appearance (with an extreme close-up of his runny nose).By the time I was into the final third of this film I found myself gazing around my living room in boredom. Soon I was fast-forwarding over every three minutes of footage. (Pity the poor cinema-goers who had no such advantage!) At every place I stopped nothing interesting was happening.

When it was over, I just sat there not wanting to leave this beautiful little boy and the man who opened his heart to this child.  So, I watched the extras and it made me love this movie even more after seeing the commentary.  Zdenek Sverak, the handsome lead character in Koyla also wrote the story.  It took him over a year because he put so much into it.  Sometimes he would have to put it away for a couple of months because it was too heart wrenching.  In my estimation, Sverak is a genius--what a compelling, beautiful and evocative story.  And, his screen presence was amazing.  A true family affair, Sverak's son, Jan, is the director.After a search spanning several countries, an unknown child, five-year-old Andrej Chalimon was found in Moscow.  This little boy is so gifted and so natural, he took my breath away and melted my heart.  The fetching Libuse Safrankova stars as Klara, the singer with the operatic voice who also ends up stealing Louka's (Sverak) heart.The story takes place in 1988 when Russia and communism is still destroying the country but is beginning to fade.  Louka, a gifted musician (viola) has been fired from the famed Czechoslovakian Philharmonic Orchestra for merely giving a sarcastic response to a Russian interrogator.  With his small income from playing at funerals/crematoriums and refurbishing grave headstones, The 55 year-old Louka falls deeper and deeper into debt.  He must support himself and his mother who lives in another town and who has a flat that is quite expensive to keep up.  His best friend talks him into marrying a young woman from Russia (who needs a Czech citizenship) for a large sum of money.  Eventually this confirmed bachelor apprehensively agrees although ends up regretting it when she immediately absconds to West Germany to be with her lover.  Alas, she leaves behind the most adorable child I have ever seen on film.  The story does have some twists and turns and all but the hardest of hearts will shed a tear.I loved this movie very, very much.

I didn't think I would ever see a movie as great.  However, after seeing KOLYA, few films captured the nurturing spirit and deepening trust and affection that developed between a little boy and an older man; the unsuspecting, Louka who would became his guardian after the boy, Kolya was abandoned by his mother.This film tugged at the heart because the role of the soon to be surrogate father is an unemployed middle-age cellist, Louka, who lost his job with the Czechoslovakian Philharmonic Orchestra.  Louka is at times comical, yet witty because he is so affable and likable.  He doesn't appear to distress too much, despite his predicament of not being employed.  Instead, he seems somewhat nonchalant as he pursues ways to earn money.  All the while, he contents himself with various lovers, yet considers himself a confirmed bachelor.  And no matter the pressure and complaints from his mother, he likes his life unmarried and w/o children.Yet bills are going unpaid, and Louka realizes he needs to find work to maintain his apartment and help support his mother.  For these reasons he begrudgingly accepts his friend's proposition to marry a young Russian woman as a way to earn a lot of money, which Louka desperately needs.  Never did he anticipate that the woman would flee and leave behind her five year old son, whom Louka must ultimately take care of after the young boy's relative dies.  Matters are further complicated because there is a language barrier.  This young child speaks Russian and has to learn to speak Czech.As the film unfolds, this charming five year old melts Louka's heart.  Louka becomes his faithful and loving protector, and little Kolya finds himself equally attached to Louka, and affectionately calls him 'father'.KOLYA is great film that will remain one of your all time favorite.Maizie Lucille JamesJuly 11, 2010",5,Excellent Czech Film,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,2000,"['favorite', 'film', 'time', 'developing', 'relationship', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'became', 'father', 'figure', 'young', 'boy', 'was', 'CINEMA', 'PARADISO', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'ever', 'see', 'movie', 'great', 'However', 'seeing', 'KOLYA', 'few', 'films', 'captured', 'nurturing', 'spirit', 'deepening', 'trust', 'affection', 'developed', 'little', 'boy', 'older', 'man', 'unsuspecting', 'Louka', 'who', 'would', 'became', 'guardian', 'boy', 'Kolya', 'was', 'abandoned', 'mother.This', 'film', 'tugged', 'heart', 'role', 'soon', 'be', 'surrogate', 'father', 'unemployed', 'middle-age', 'cellist', 'Louka', 'who', 'lost', 'job', 'Czechoslovakian', 'Philharmonic', 'Orchestra', 'Louka', 'times', 'comical', 'yet', 'witty', 'so', 'affable', 'likable', ""n't"", 'appear', 'distress', 'too', 'much', 'predicament', 'not', 'being', 'employed', 'Instead', 'somewhat', 'nonchalant', 'ways', 'earn', 'money', 'while', 'various', 'lovers', 'considers', 'confirmed', 'bachelor', 'matter', 'pressure', 'complaints', 'mother', 'life', 'unmarried', 'w/o', 'children.Yet', 'bills', 'are', 'going', 'unpaid', 'Louka', 'find', 'work', 'maintain', 'apartment', 'help', 'support', 'mother', 'reasons', 'begrudgingly', 'friend', 'proposition', 'marry', 'young', 'Russian', 'woman', 'way', 'earn', 'lot', 'money', 'Louka', 'desperately', 'Never', 'did', 'anticipate', 'woman', 'would', 'flee', 'leave', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'whom', 'Louka', 'must', 'ultimately', 'take', 'care', 'young', 'boy', 'relative', 'dies', 'Matters', 'are', 'further', 'complicated', 'language', 'barrier', 'young', 'child', 'speaks', 'Russian', 'learn', 'speak', 'Czech.As', 'film', 'unfolds', 'charming', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'melts', 'Louka', 'heart', 'Louka', 'faithful', 'loving', 'protector', 'little', 'Kolya', 'equally', 'attached', 'Louka', 'affectionately', 'great', 'film', 'will', 'remain', 'one', 'time', 'favorite.Maizie', 'Lucille', 'JamesJuly', '11', '2010']",N/A

The portrait of the crusty bachelor Loukas; the scenes of the musicians bantering among themselves as they play at the cremtorium (much like the musicians I know); the beautiful scenes of Prague and the Czech countryside; the wonderful music, including selections by Dvorak and Smetana; the portrait of the little boy Kolya, particularly the scene in which he tries to &quot;telephone&quot; his deceased grandmother. For someone like myself, who never experienced Communism first hand, the little scenes in which the characters express their fear of the Secret Police are chilling. And of course the exhilaration of the overthrow of the tyrannical Czech communist government - what a great moment that must have been.It may be presumptuous for me to suggest this, but perhaps a story of reconciliation between a Czech and a Russian is a note of forgiveness toward Russia and Russians from a people who suffered greatly from Soviet tyranny: a reconciliation that must happen if Europe is ever to know a lasting peace.No doubt there are better Czech movies.

For that I'm grateful because everything that emerged was a pleasant surprize.  I should just stop there and let it be a surprize for you, too.  However, let me just say that this is a sophisticated and well-done version of a theme that is usually done with more slapstick and ""juvenile"" humor.  It's not that those other movies were bad; it's just that we seem to keep getting a different version of the same thing substituting different stars to attract different audiences.  I recall a movie I saw as a child that starred Clifton Webb.  I think it was entitled ""Sitting Pretty"" and it, too, seemed to have a slightly more sophisticated version but ""Kolya"" is a film that stands alone.Synopsis aside, ""Kolya"" is also worthwhile on other levels.

Regardless, he enjoys life as a 50+ year old bachelor with a deserved reputation for appreciating younger women.

A week after the wedding, he finds he is in sole possession of a 5 year old son, Kolya, who speaks only Russian. Needless to say, having a quiet boy in his ""tower"" (as his apartment is known, even to the police) puts a cramp in Louka's style.Here's where the plot gets more predictable, of course, but the process of acclimatization for both Louka and Kolya is subtle and delightful.

The story revolves around a cellist called Louka (Zdenek Sver&aacute;k... as handsome as Sean Connery) who despite his virtuosity only plays at funerals. Louka is middle-aged, single and has promiscuous flings with women. He is struggling financially and gets coaxed into a surrogate marriage with a Russian lady. The marriage is a trite business deal: The Russian gets Czech citizenship and Louka much needed money. However, the Russian emigrates to West Germany as soon as she becomes a Czech citizen. The cops smell fish and come looking for Louka. Things get even better when Louka gets surprise baggage in the form of Kolja (his Russian wife's son played by Andrei Chalimon). Kolja can only speak Russian, has nowehere to go and Louka is forced to take him in. This marks a turning point in Louka's life.The reluctant father & reluctant son interaction is hilarious, heartwarming and poignant. In one of the scenes Louka prepares dinner and tea for Kolja, who stubbornly refuses to eat. Despite Louka's constant urging to eat Kolja doesn't oblige. Louka gives up, turns away from the dinner table in hopeless despair. After a little while he comes back to dinner table to find that Kolja has finished the hot cup of tea. Kolja has taken Louka in. Their bond gets stronger and they get close to each other. Louka even manages get his ex-girlfriends to sing lullabies for Kolja over the phone. Suddenly, Louka finds immense sense & purpose in his life. However, life takes another turn and his Russian wife comes back from West Germany to take possession of Kolja (she isn't staying). Kolja leaves with his mother. Louka is a lonely person once again, but transformed.The movie is very artistic and some of the best scenes in the movie do not have dialogs, just powerful silent expressions and gestures. A better part of the movie has been shot in beautiful Prague (a city brimming with stunning architecture, paved streets, magnificent bridges and beautiful people) that just adds to the movie's appeal.The movie alludes to the Velvet revolution, but that didn't capture my attention at all.

It works on a well-run formulaic basis -- anti-social, anti-marriage older bachelor gets stuck with a small child who changes his life and values. But it is so much more satisfying when pulled off by skilled smaller filmmakers on a human scale rather than done up in Hollywood with the likes of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant.Value is also added to the formula by placing the action at the time of the fall of the Iron Curtain and the transition to a democratic system in the former Czechoslovakia. So there are nice local historical and cultural factors -- most notably the fact that the child in question is Russian, and therefore is automatically despised right out of the gate by a significant section of the local population. It gives the film a good chance to look at these stereotypes -- which is itself formulaic, I know. But you know why they use formulas? Because they work. They have an emotional effect on the average human being, as demonstrated by focus group after focus group. The formulas are executed well here, and the cultural context leaves us, the non-Czech viewing public, with plenty of fresh input to explore. It doesn't feel stale at all.Finally, I have to mention the cinematography. It's not spectacular like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or anything, but it really is brilliant.

428518,A3IB6BLXU304PF,6304554168,Zenful,"[7, 7]","I first saw this film close to 10 years ago, long before it was nominated for, and won an Oscar award.  At that time I was a graduate student studying international relations and the themes in Kolya were so real and vivid.  I myself had been in the Czech Republic in the Spring of 1992 as a student so I was unsure if my fondness for the film was because of my particular history with Europe at that time or whether it really was a great film.  Thankfully, my memories of this film were not betrayed upon my recent revisit and I highly recommend this for first time viewers or returners.Although the obvious ""political"" themes of the movie (Russian occupation of Czechoslovakia and the impact on daily life there) are less significant now, the depiction of this older Czech man (the perpetual bachelor unattached and seemingly satisfied in his solitary existence save for the occasion need to satisfy his carnal desires with visits from women young and old alike)  and his relationship with the little Russian boy ( the pure and innocent youth who symbolizes the hope and promise and trust and faith that his older counterpart is conspicuously missing) that captured his heart are timeless.  Whilst at times I worry that some of the meaning of the story is lost for non- Russian and non- Czech speakers (part of the poignancy of this story is in that the little boy who becomes the ward of this old man speaks only Russian and the man speaks only Czech...  so they attempt to communicate with each other but the detail of this is lost for those of us unfamiliar with either language), even with subtitles you can gain much of the spirit of the film by watching the interplay and the fondness between the boy, Kolya and the man, Louka.This is a story to warm your heart, it is in the tradition of cinema that does not rely on creative use of light nor colour nor extensive dialogue.  Instead it is an exercise in movement and emotion, of innocence lost and innocence returned.  It is a slice of life, there are no deeper nor hidden moral lessons here.  Rather it is a demonstration of the basic human need of companionship and love, for however brief, in whatever form it takes.
