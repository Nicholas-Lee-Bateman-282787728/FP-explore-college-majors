923517,AKV9F8HZ7XX0B,B000A7Q1YC,AC,"[2, 3]","I distinctly remember this show as being the first of very few 'appointment television' -type shows to dot the landscape of the TV-watching aspect of my life.  I looked forward to every single episode of ""Ned and Stacey"", loved the show, & was bewildered & seriously bummed when it was cancelled.Having a humorous premise is one thing (& on the face of it, the premise of this show is practically ripe for humor), but to be able to take it in multiple directions, let alone come up with so many plausible potential scenarios, issues, & 'consequences' -- given the premise of 2 people who irritate each other, but get married & live together so that each can gain something of specific importance -- required intelligence & creativity, & skillful writing & execution.  The writing was terrific, & the acting by the 4 principal actors (as well as others, for that matter) was fantastic, & topped off by the chemistry between them, collectively rendered each episode a wonderful, interesting, & humorous look at various 'what if(s)' associated with the lives of 2 strong-willed people contending with the constraint-filled & what-others-expect-to-be-true-and-assume-of-two-people-who-are-married circumstance that they themselves created, & about which only 2 others in their inner circle know the truth.Along the way, the various comical scenarios end up illustrating some irony & various truths about people, & relationships (& marriages, in particular), that make for an all-the-more-interesting ride when taking a 'trip' through Ned and Stacey -land... Also, & which is seemingly inevitable when it comes to various people who don't actually take the time to get to know one another, but then spend extensive time around each other, you see ~hint-like occasional moments when Ned & Stacey seem to come to a better understanding of each other, & while they won't admit it, they gradually start to have a bit of respect for each other, & the formative element of a friendship is ultimately 'there' despite the 'best efforts' of each to think they couldn't possibly like the other.I've just watched episodes of this series (the entire first season) for the first time since it was originally broadcast, over 15 years ago, & the humor holds up so incredibly well, all these years later.  I am delighted beyond words to be able to watch episodes of this show again, & in watching the first season in a kind of 'marathon viewing session', was reminded of just how rare it is for me to find *any* television series which makes me laugh out loud & smile so much.I hope like crazy that Season Two is ultimately made available -- not only for those of us who watched the series when it was originally televised, but also for those who either didn't happen to catch it the first time around, or weren't able to (for some, due only to the fact that they were children at the time [& not old enough for a show with a premise involving marriage], let alone those who were not yet born).  Studio head honchos & decision-makers -- please, please, please make Season Two available on DVD.Thomas Haden Church has always been in a class by himself, & his unique & significant impact on this series is a comedy wonder to behold.  While I liked him in ""Wings"", I absolutely loved him in ""Ned and Stacey"".  Similarly, while I liked Debra Messing in ""Will & Grace"", I enjoyed her far more in ""Ned & Stacey"".  Additionally, Greg Germann, who I've enjoyed in many projects over the years, was terrific in this series (among so many things, there are times when he has to 'turn on a dime', perceived allegiance -wise, & he is able to convey so much [& comically so] with just a quick change in his facial expression [at times followed by some well-delivered accompanying line]).  And Nadia Dajani, who I've seen in various projects since ""Ned & Stacey"", is fantastic as Stacey's sister, who thinks Stacey is nuts to have entered into a 'fake marriage', & to boot, Nadia's character can't stand Ned, suffers no fools, & 'tells it like it is' -- albeit with such skillfully delivered lines & accompanying facial expression & body language, & to great comedic effect.Lastly, the limited special features with the Season One set are interesting & fun.Love, love, love this show...",5,"A fantastic & funny series that was ahead of its time, & still triggers laugh out loud

923521,A1L1NJNVL5ICZB,B000A7Q1YC,"Cloudburst2000 ""OasisRocks""","[24, 28]","If you like Will and Grace, then you are sure to enjoy this sitcom that played for two seasons in the mid-90s.  My roommate and I were obsessed with this show during college.  I was actually very surprised and excited to see it come out on DVD considering it was never hugely popular.  That's one of the sad things about television today...the truly good shows like Ned and Stacey are overlooked while drivel like Life According to Jim last multiple seasons.The premise of Ned and Stacey is simple.  Ned marries Stacey to get a job promotion, and Stacey marries Ned so she can have a place to live and move out of her parent's house.  The catch is they barely know each other, and what they do know of each other, they don't particularly care for.  They are both allowed to date other people as long as they are discreet and don't let certain people know about the 'arranged' marriage...namely Ned's co-waorkers and Stacey's parents(who incidentally adore Ned and Ned them which leads to a very humorous episode).  Stacey's sister and brother-in-law(Ned's best friend and co-worker) know of the arrangement and make some humorous sidekicks for Ned and Stacey.What truly makes this show great is the chemistry between Debra Messing and Thomas Haden Church who play Stacey and Ned, respectively.  They just play off each other beautifully.  Granted, they argue most of the time which leads to many humorous moments, but they do get along in their own way...sometimes.  This show is not about a couple who hate each other...as Ned and Stacey definitely don't hate each other.  It's more about personality-clash in close living-quarters.  Ned is a neat though sometimes morally-ambigious character while Stacey is a slob who likes to think of herself as morally-superior...Ned often throws this in her face mocking how such a moral person could ever get involved in a 'fake' marriage.Anywho, this was definitely my favorite sitcom of the 90s.  I was highly disappointed when it was cancelled am ecstatic to see it out on DVD.  I can't wait until the second season and last season comes out.",5,Waaayyy better than Will and Grace...,1128643200,"10 7, 2005",2005,2086,"['like', 'Will', 'Grace', 'then', 'are', 'sure', 'enjoy', 'sitcom', 'played', 'two', 'seasons', 'mid-90s', 'roommate', 'were', 'obsessed', 'show', 'college', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'surprised', 'excited', 'see', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'considering', 'was', 'never', 'hugely', 'popular', 'one', 'sad', 'things', 'television', 'today', 'truly', 'good', 'shows', 'Ned', 'Stacey', 'are', 'overlooked', 'drivel', 'Life', 'According', 'Jim', 'last', 'multiple', 'seasons.The', 'premise', 'Ned', 'Stacey', 'simple', 'Ned', 'marries', 'Stacey', 'get', 'job', 'promotion', 'Stacey', 'marries', 'Ned', 'can', 'have', 'place', 'live', 'move', 'out', 'parent', 'house', 'catch', 'barely', 'know', 'other', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'are', 'allowed', 'date', 'other', 'people', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'discreet', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'certain', 'people', 'know', ""'arranged"", 'marriage', 'namely', 'Ned', 'co-waorkers', 'Stacey', 'parents', 'who', 'incidentally', 'adore', 'Ned', 'Ned', 'very', 'humorous', 'episode', 'Stacey', 'sister', 'brother-in-law', 'Ned', 'best', 'friend', 'co-worker', 'know', 'arrangement', 'make', 'humorous', 'sidekicks', 'Ned', 'Stacey.What', 'truly', 'show', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'who', 'play', 'Stacey', 'Ned', 'respectively', 'just', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'beautifully', 'Granted', 'argue', 'most', 'time', 'many', 'humorous', 'moments', 'do', 'get', 'along', 'own', 'way', 'sometimes', 'show', 'not', 'couple', 'who', 'hate', 'other', 'Ned', 'Stacey', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'other', 'more', 'personality-clash', 'close', 'living-quarters', 'Ned', 'neat', 'sometimes', 'morally-ambigious', 'character', 'Stacey', 'slob', 'who', 'think', 'morally-superior', 'Ned', 'often', 'face', 'mocking', 'how', 'such', 'moral', 'person', 'could', 'ever', 'get', 'involved', ""'fake"", 'marriage.Anywho', 'was', 'definitely', 'favorite', 'sitcom', '90s', 'was', 'highly', 'disappointed', 'when', 'was', 'cancelled', 'am', 'ecstatic', 'see', 'out', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'second', 'season', 'last', 'season', 'out']",Ned and Stacey - The Complete First Season
923522,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000A7Q1YC,Cubist,"[11, 11]","Ned (Haden Church) is a cynical, self-absorbed advertising agency executive. Stacey (Messing) is an idealist who writes for The Village Voice. They are set-up on a blind date by their friends and its love and hate at first sight. He's superficial and she's all about substance. She's a left-winger and he's a self-proclaimed ""no winger."" Sounds like the perfect couple, right? Ned and Stacey was a short-lived sitcom that developed a small, buy loyal following. They have now been rewarded as Sony has released the first season of the show on DVD.It's amazing that this show was even aired let alone lasting as long as it did - two seasons in total. The premise alone must've been problematic for the network: two self-absorbed people getting married for all the wrong reasons. Like the characters in Seinfeld (which is also set in New York City), the characters in Ned and Stacey don't particularly care if the audience likes them and that's what gives the show its edge. For example, in one episode we see the cutthroat world of corporate America first hand as Ned gleefully rubs it in a rival's face that he got married to get his cushy promotion over him. There is a sarcastic attitude that is prevalent throughout the show and a welcome alternative to the shiny, happy people of most other sitcoms. Ned and Stacey would go on to become even more surreal as one of the main cast would be killed off in an episode only to come back in the next one.With these kinds of things going on, it's not surprising that people like Alan Ball (American Beauty, Six Feet Under) and Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) would eventually write for the show before it was prematurely cancelled during its second season. Ned and Stacey may have been a classic, opposites attract story wrapped in a sardonic package but it was too acerbic a show for mainstream audiences. Fortunately, this DVD has been released so that its fans can enjoy what was produced during its brief stint.There is a retrospective featurette entitled, ""Strings Attached: Ned and Stacey, Season One."" Thomas Haden Church, Debra Messing, Greg Germann and Nadia Dajani are back for brand new interviews as they reminisce about their experiences working on the show.There is also an audio commentary on the ""Pilot"" episode by series creator Weithorn. He ends up fleshing out some of the comments he made in the featurette (i.e. casting Haden Church and Messing) with some decent anecdotal information on this low-key track.",4,A funny show ahead of its time finally on DVD!,1127347200,"09 22, 2005",2005,2520,"['Ned', 'Haden', 'Church', 'cynical', 'self-absorbed', 'advertising', 'agency', 'executive', 'Stacey', 'Messing', 'idealist', 'who', 'Village', 'Voice', 'are', 'set-up', 'blind', 'date', 'friends', 'love', 'hate', 'first', 'sight', 'superficial', 'substance', 'left-winger', 'self-proclaimed', 'winger', 'perfect', 'couple', 'right', 'Ned', 'Stacey', 'was', 'short-lived', 'sitcom', 'developed', 'small', 'buy', 'loyal', 'following', 'have', 'now', 'been', 'rewarded', 'Sony', 'released', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'DVD.It', 'amazing', 'show', 'was', 'even', 'aired', 'let', 'alone', 'lasting', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'two', 'seasons', 'total', 'premise', 'alone', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'problematic', 'network', 'two', 'self-absorbed', 'people', 'getting', 'married', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'characters', 'Seinfeld', 'also', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'characters', 'Ned', 'Stacey', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'audience', 'show', 'edge', 'example', 'one', 'episode', 'see', 'cutthroat', 'world', 'corporate', 'America', 'first', 'hand', 'Ned', 'gleefully', 'rival', 'face', 'got', 'married', 'get', 'cushy', 'promotion', 'sarcastic', 'attitude', 'prevalent', 'show', 'welcome', 'alternative', 'shiny', 'happy', 'people', 'most', 'other', 'sitcoms', 'Ned', 'Stacey', 'would', 'go', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'surreal', 'one', 'main', 'cast', 'would', 'be', 'killed', 'off', 'episode', 'only', 'come', 'back', 'next', 'one.With', 'kinds', 'things', 'going', 'not', 'surprising', 'people', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'would', 'eventually', 'write', 'show', 'was', 'prematurely', 'cancelled', 'second', 'season', 'Ned', 'Stacey', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'classic', 'attract', 'story', 'wrapped', 'sardonic', 'package', 'was', 'too', 'acerbic', 'show', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'Fortunately', 'DVD', 'been', 'released', 'so', 'fans', 'can', 'enjoy', 'what', 'was', 'produced', 'brief', 'retrospective', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'Strings', 'Attached', 'Ned', 'Stacey', 'Season', 'One', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'Greg', 'Germann', 'Nadia', 'Dajani', 'are', 'back', 'brand', 'new', 'interviews', 'reminisce', 'experiences', 'working', 'show.There', 'also', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'series', 'creator', 'Weithorn', 'up', 'fleshing', 'comments', 'made', 'featurette', 'i.e', 'casting', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Messing', 'decent', 'anecdotal', 'information', 'low-key', 'track']",Ned and Stacey - The Complete First Season

They create a facade of a loving marriage around Ned's clients but, aside from that, they can date whomever they want as long as they are discreet about it. He was able to elevate all of his co-stars around him, Messing, Greg Germann and Nadia Dajami and had great comedic chemistry with all of them. Especially found him at his zany and crazy best with Germann's character Eric Moyer or ""Rico"" as Ned lovingly calls his best friend and co-worker.
