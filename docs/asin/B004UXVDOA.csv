Angie Harmon does a great job as Jane, but the Maura we know from the books has been replaced by a Dr. Brennan/Sarah Jessica Parker hybrid.

Maura is in love with a priest- I can see why they would avoid that on TV, but it also flavors a lot of story.The show spends a lot of time with the girls bickering like children or playing gay. It's kind of sad. Why not just make them lovers if that's what the producers think these characters are? Gay or straight, I really hope they stop making these characters act like bimbos.

Bruce McGill as Vince Korsak and Lee Thompson Young as Barry Frost are back as Rizzoli's fellow detectives.In this second season, Boston's finest get a broader range of cases, including the murder of a returning war veteran, a killer in uniform who strikes during Boston's Fleet Week, the abduction of an undercover cop's child, and the strange death of a baseball coach, among others.Jane Rizzoli's family gets a bigger role in the second season, as her patrolman brother Frankie wants a piece of the action, her newly divorced mother Angela (Lorraine Bracco) moves in with Jane and takes a job at the police cafeteria, and Jane's other brother just wants to stay out of jail. Also, we meet Maura's adoptive mother and her rather dangerous biological father.The heart of the show continues to be the often hilarious interaction between Jane and Maura.  Imagine the possibiities of Maura taking tomboyish Jane to a spa or attempting to dress her for a formal date, or of Jane trying to ward off Maura's unwanted suitor by pretending to be her lesbian girlfriend, and you get the idea.""Rizzoli & Isles: The Complete Second Season"" is highly recommended to its fans.

Family steps to the foreground in this episode that tracks the murders of the dockworkers in Boston. The head of the organization has been Maura's (Sasha Alexander) birth father (John Doman) but he is now on the hunted list and brought to Maura's home in need of care.  No love lost here on Maura's part but by the end of the episode the blood ties seem to mean something. Jane's (Angie Harmon) brother Tommy (Colin Egglesfield) is attracted to Maura - over an ongoing chess game, Jane's mother (Lorraine Bracco) remains her slightly off the wall self, and Jane is left to coach the situation of the multiple murders - and avoid the Sensitivity Training that runs as a comic thread through this episode.  An interesting guest appearance by Ed Begley, Jr as a fellow Autopsy Surgeon adds some flavor.  The episode covers a lot of territory but still maintains that fine balance between the comic banter of the two women law enforcement officers and the at times grueling visual events taking place along the waterfront of Boston.  How they will wind this series down with the last episode remains to be seen, but this is a show that matures well with age.

I was hoping that the rest of the characters would grow on me during the second season.  Unfortunately, that did not happen.  The second season of the show only reinforced and amplified my dislike for pretty much every character in the show except for Jane Rizzoli.  Jane's family was so annoying that I literally cringed when they delivered their awkward and often forced attempts at humor.  The Dr. Maura Isles character remained just as hard to relate to as before and Jane's other coworkers remained just as uninteresting as ever to me.

It seems like the actresses have fun with their roles and with each other and watching their friendship is a fun dimension of the show.  It's also nice to see that despite their insecurities and downright awkward/dorky moments, they are ultimately portrayed as smart, insightful women who are excellent at what they do and who have compassion and depth in their dealings with others when it matters most.The mysteries are fine...often predictable, but entertaining and perfectly serviceable in a show that does not take itself overly seriously.  And yet, there are definitely compelling storylines and even some dark notes (Jane's nemesis creeps me out).I like that this show cares about interpersonal dynamics and we see characters work through conflicts and we see characters grow.  While the actor playing Mr. Rizzoli in Season 1 was talented and of a high pedigree (!), his cartoonish character was probably as annoying to play as it was to watch and his absence in Season 2 is a good change.  Jane's mom is still a bit over the top, but we saw more depth and nuance to her this season and hopefully that will continue in Season 3 as well.I enjoyed seeing Detective Frost come into his own this season.  He may still be squeamish, but he is also smart, strong, loyal and insightful.
