675492,A2SUN8X3XBY1DK,B00005QJJL,nimravus brachyops,"[1, 2]","I guess ""Angels Hard As They Come"" could've had some potential but it just never delivers.  I've read this movie's supposed to be ""hippies vs. bikers"" but it's really ""bikers vs. bikers with hippies in the middle"".  However exciting this may sound, it plays out awkwardly and even boobs, drugs, and violence can't save it.  Maybe it's the script was weak, or the characters were never really developed, but the main flaw is simply a technical one; most of this film is underexposed.  It's simply too dark to see what's going on.Scott Glenn's fans probably expect some hypermacho stuff, but he mostly mumbles and seems oddly passive.  This must've been an early role for him.A lot of films in the biker genre were hastily put together and turned out rather dull, and this is one of them.
