762372,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0000ACP48,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","I bought this DVD immediately when it was released.Who could pass up an an anime based and parodies the actual anime industry? I've heard about these type of parody anime and I recall reading about Mikimoto Haruhiko (""Macross"", ""Gunbuster"", etc.) actually creating one but was only given to staff and friends back in the early 90's but really haven't seen anything for the many years I have been watching anime.But there are always stories about the behind-the-scenes of an animation studio and how sometimes the anime that is aired, sometimes gets there within minutes or an hour after finalization. From the crazy tight deadlines and overworked staff, for those of us here in America who will never get to experience or see that kind of work environment of how anime is created and developed, fortunately ""Animation Runner Kuromi"" is here.The series is directed by Daichi Akitaro known for his work with ""Fruits Basket"", ""Now and Then, Here and There"" and ""Jubei-Chan the Ninja Girl"" to name a few. The sreenwriter is Nagatsuki Tou and the OAV won ""BEST OAV"" Award at the Tokyo International Anime Fair.The series is about a new employee named Oguro Mikiko (which the president of the company automatically names her Kuromi) who was hired to work at the famous animation studio, Studio Petit.The studio is behind on schedule for ""Time Journeys Episode 2' and with the boss falling ill, he appoints Kuromi as production desk manager and puts her immediately in charge.Essentially just a newbie in the industry with hardly any experience, Kuromi is put in leadership position and has to motivate a staff that is too lax and literally a bunch of slackers. With the threat of the second episode of ""Time Journeys"" not being completed, Kuromi is learning that this staff, during deadlines, they make excuses and end their work early. The fact that many of them work at home, makes it a problem for Kuromi.Because of their way of working, Kuromi feels dejected and has nightmares that the episode will not get to the TV station on time and feels like quitting.But Kuromi decides to not quit and make immediate changes that will affect the studio and hopefully they will complete the next episode of ""Time Journeys"".I pretty much enjoyed the insight of an anime studio. May it be the parody from the anime OAV or the actual behind-the-scenes footage on the special features.I'm very glad to see that CPM decided to include so many special features for the DVD release and all in all, it was just a blast to watch, especially if you have interest on what goes behind-the-scenes at an anime studio.But all in all, this is an OAV that is not meant to be taken seriously, it is not meant to spawn a TV series. It's just a parody on what goes on at an anime studio and for anime fans to just sit back and enjoy.It accomplishes what it wants to convey to the viewer. No deep storyline, no major character development. Just an enjoyable and hilarious OAV about woman working her dream job at an anime studio and realizing that it's all hard work, stressful but is handled in a way that people can watch, understand but laugh at the same time.I got what I want from it and that's to learn about the crazy things that go on at an anime studio and the fact that the viewer not only just gets to see a parody of it, but also included in the special features are video footage of people at work. That was great to see!All in all, I recommend this OAV series for the anime fan who has interest on how an anime series is created.",5,"An enjoyable parody of the anime industry, `Animation Runner Kuromi' is an enjoyable OAV featured with a lot of humor and more!",1218153600,"08 8, 2008",2008,3510,"['bought', 'DVD', 'immediately', 'when', 'was', 'released.Who', 'could', 'pass', 'up', 'anime', 'based', 'actual', 'anime', 'industry', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'type', 'parody', 'anime', 'recall', 'reading', 'Mikimoto', 'Haruhiko', 'Macross', 'Gunbuster', 'etc', 'actually', 'creating', 'one', 'was', 'only', 'given', 'staff', 'back', 'early', '90', 'really', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'many', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'anime.But', 'are', 'always', 'stories', 'behind-the-scenes', 'animation', 'studio', 'how', 'sometimes', 'anime', 'aired', 'sometimes', 'there', 'minutes', 'hour', 'finalization', 'crazy', 'tight', 'deadlines', 'overworked', 'staff', 'here', 'America', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'experience', 'see', 'kind', 'work', 'environment', 'how', 'anime', 'created', 'developed', 'fortunately', 'Animation', 'Runner', 'Kuromi', 'here.The', 'series', 'directed', 'Daichi', 'Akitaro', 'known', 'work', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'Now', 'Then', 'Here', 'Jubei-Chan', 'Ninja', 'Girl', 'name', 'few', 'sreenwriter', 'Nagatsuki', 'Tou', 'OAV', 'won', 'BEST', 'OAV', 'Award', 'Tokyo', 'International', 'Anime', 'Fair.The', 'series', 'new', 'employee', 'named', 'Oguro', 'Mikiko', 'president', 'company', 'automatically', 'Kuromi', 'who', 'was', 'hired', 'work', 'famous', 'animation', 'studio', 'Studio', 'Petit.The', 'studio', 'schedule', 'Time', 'Journeys', 'Episode', '2', 'boss', 'falling', 'ill', 'Kuromi', 'production', 'desk', 'manager', 'immediately', 'charge.Essentially', 'just', 'newbie', 'industry', 'hardly', 'experience', 'Kuromi', 'put', 'leadership', 'position', 'motivate', 'staff', 'too', 'lax', 'literally', 'bunch', 'slackers', 'threat', 'second', 'episode', 'Time', 'Journeys', 'not', 'being', 'completed', 'Kuromi', 'learning', 'staff', 'deadlines', 'make', 'excuses', 'end', 'work', 'early', 'fact', 'many', 'work', 'home', 'problem', 'Kuromi.Because', 'way', 'working', 'Kuromi', 'feels', 'dejected', 'nightmares', 'episode', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'TV', 'station', 'time', 'feels', 'quitting.But', 'Kuromi', 'not', 'quit', 'make', 'immediate', 'changes', 'will', 'affect', 'studio', 'hopefully', 'will', 'complete', 'next', 'episode', 'Time', 'Journeys', '.I', 'pretty', 'much', 'insight', 'anime', 'studio', 'May', 'be', 'parody', 'anime', 'OAV', 'actual', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'special', 'features.I', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'see', 'CPM', 'decided', 'include', 'so', 'many', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'release', 'was', 'just', 'blast', 'watch', 'especially', 'have', 'interest', 'what', 'behind-the-scenes', 'anime', 'studio.But', 'OAV', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'not', 'meant', 'spawn', 'TV', 'series', 'just', 'parody', 'what', 'anime', 'studio', 'anime', 'fans', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy.It', 'accomplishes', 'what', 'convey', 'viewer', 'deep', 'storyline', 'major', 'character', 'development', 'Just', 'enjoyable', 'hilarious', 'OAV', 'woman', 'working', 'dream', 'job', 'anime', 'studio', 'realizing', 'hard', 'work', 'stressful', 'handled', 'way', 'people', 'can', 'watch', 'understand', 'laugh', 'same', 'time.I', 'got', 'what', 'want', 'learn', 'crazy', 'things', 'go', 'anime', 'studio', 'fact', 'viewer', 'not', 'only', 'just', 'see', 'parody', 'also', 'included', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'video', 'footage', 'people', 'work', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'recommend', 'OAV', 'series', 'anime', 'fan', 'who', 'interest', 'how', 'anime', 'series', 'created']",N/A

Many of the characters in the DVD are like the ones who you would run across in real life. They are all individualists, artistic types with their own eccentric lifestyles. The challenge for the manager is to get all these people who are mainly loners, to work as a team, get the work down on time and edit the final product that will help generate a good return on the investment of money that went into making it. I would recommend this DVD along with the followup one of Kuromi 2 to see how the entire anime industry works.",4,Animation Runner Kuromi,1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,672,"['liked', 'DVD', 'story', 'how', 'successful', 'anime', 'series', 'made', 'obstacles', 'have', 'be', 'overcome', 'make', 'hit', 'Many', 'characters', 'DVD', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'would', 'run', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'individualists', 'artistic', 'types', 'own', 'eccentric', 'lifestyles', 'challenge', 'manager', 'get', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'mainly', 'loners', 'work', 'team', 'get', 'work', 'down', 'time', 'edit', 'final', 'product', 'will', 'help', 'generate', 'good', 'return', 'investment', 'money', 'went', 'making', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'followup', 'one', 'Kuromi', '2', 'see', 'how', 'entire', 'anime', 'industry']",N/A
762374,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B0000ACP48,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[9, 12]","If there is one unfortunate drawback about ANIMATION RUNNER KUROMI, it may be that it's much too short.  Too short, clocking in at only 38 minutes.  This is a definite shame, because, at best, this lucky winner of the ""Best OVA Feature Award"" at the Tokyo International Anime Fair, is hilarious, wacky, laugh-out-loud fun.Directed by Akitaroh Daichi (NOW AND THEN, THEN AND THERE and FRUITS BASKET), this is a mockumentary about life at an animation studio in (where else?) Japan.  At the center of it all is the title character, Makiko Okuro (nicknamed Kuromi), a young, peppy college graduate whose first day of work at this animation studio, Studio Petit, turns out to be a nightmarish experience.  The current production manager falls mysteriously sick on giving her a tour of the residence, time is a-running out for the studio to produce Episode 2 of TIME JOURNEYS, and the animation staff -- all with the most eccentric of personalities and problems: there's this guy who produces a lot of key animation sheets but does them horribly out of order, a slacker who only churns out few, if any work, due to being surrounded by toys, a pessimistic woman who really needs to be complimented and look on the bright side, and a newly-wed animator who has a lot to complain about her husband andreducesherselftotalkingamileaminutewhenshementionsherdilemmas -- is falling behind schedule.  What's a new assistant manager like Kuromi to do?  Of course, everything works out, but not before we survive an onslaught of outrageously funny scenes, gags, in-joke references, and eyepoppingly colorful animation techniques similar to those of HIS AND HER CIRCUMSTANCES (badly drawn Cartoon exaggerations from our characters one moment, and the next, super-deformed!).All of this might seem like a hodgepodge of nonsense, but it works because it's so consistent and obvious.  It's also an interesting look at how life at an animation studio can sometimes be turbulent (and introduce people to the inside stories of what REALLY goes in the production stages of putting together an animated show).  It does all of this so entertainingly that it becomes a shame when it just ends so soon.  A show like this really could have been expanded.  Not that I'm upset, though: the director and his team are reported to have begun work on the sequel.I was at the BIG APPLE ANIME FEST in New York when I purchased this title.  I had come to attend the Voice Acting Panel and have three DVDs of mine autographed by voice actress Lisa Ortiz for her wonderful performances as Deedlit the High Elf from RECORD OF LODOSS WAR, and Tsubasa Shibahime from HIS AND HER CIRCUMSTANCES.  However, upon listening to the dub, I am pleased to announce that Ortiz once again shines in her over-the-top, enthusiastic portrayal of Kuromi, using her Shibahime voice for the most part.  (She says in an interview included on this DVD that she has been known to be crazy sometimes!)  Even better, it's got Eric Stuart and Angora Deb in two show-stealing roles (Stuart gets the guy who churns out a lot of unorganized animation sheets while Deb gets the part of the fast-talking complainer).  Central Park Media's dubs often get a bad rap from some dub fans and sub purists, but I'll admit to having enjoyed the LODOSS dubs from them, and strongly suggest that people give this dub a try.  It's hilariously entertaining, although sometimes a little TOO close to the subtitled script (a flaw in most CPM dubs).  However, there isn't much lost in the translation and the performers do a lively job with their roles.Add to this package a gorgeous transfer (which sometimes suffers from a little too much line and edge enhancement), storyboards, an interview (and commentary track!) from the director, and some other nice bonuses, and what more can you ask for?  Only the fact that it only clocks in at 40 minutes.Those who are curious about how Anime is produced, enjoy.",4,"It's fun, it's funny, it's not long enough.

Imagine her surprise when she arrives to an empty studio, well, empty except for her predecessor, who was just waiting for her to arrive so he could quit! It's 10am and the guy tells her that the staff will be in later in the day! Kuromi has the job of assistant production manager (animation runner) which basically means she has to keep the office up and running and on schedule and collect all the artwork that is being done outside of the studio. She finds this to be harder to do than she thought when she finds that 95% of the artists don't have much of a work ethic. So Kuromi has 5 of the 312 scenes that she needs for episode 2 of the series Time Journeys and has no idea how those scenes will be completed before the deadline. Will Kuromi have enough spunk, drive, and determination not only to motivate herself but the staff of the show to ramp up their efforts to meet the due date?The director of Kuromi, Akitaroh Daichi, is known for his bipolar proclivities with the over the top shojo humor of Fruits Basket, and the depressing sadness of Now and Then, Here and There. Here, Daichi goes to the humor end of that spectrum, and as usual suffers from one dimensionality. The humor in Kuromi is so over the top (Think Kodacha and Excel Saga), that your brain begins to hurt from the hyperactive writing. While that style of energy is annoying, what really puts a capper on this show is that it's not really funny. The comic acting is too caricatured and full of sound and fury meaning nothing.
