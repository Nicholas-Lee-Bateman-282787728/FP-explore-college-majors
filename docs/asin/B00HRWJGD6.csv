I decided to take the plunge. This is a detailed look at the album with Pete Townshend giving us his deep thoughts into the making and meaning of Tommy. There are also comments from Roger and posthumously from John and Keith Moon.  There are a lot of music footage included and what impressed me is the fact the producers of this DVD were kind enough to include mostly full performances of these classic songs from various concerts. Some of the footage rare and not seen before.It is an enjoyable show throughout and well paced. Pete's an extraordinary man and his vision of Tommy is well told here.The bonus footage is a TV special the Who did in Germany in 1969 highlighting the best songs from Tommy like a long music clip in B&W; unfortunately. It would be far better in colour.Overall a worthy DVD if you love the Who.",4,Sensation - The Story Of Tommy (DVD),1401580800,"06 1, 2014",2014,940,"['was', 'not', 'sure', 'should', 'get', 'DVD', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'Who', 'documentary', 'out', 'there', 'DVD', 'are', 'good', 'decided', 'take', 'plunge', 'detailed', 'look', 'album', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'giving', 'deep', 'thoughts', 'making', 'meaning', 'Tommy', 'are', 'also', 'comments', 'Roger', 'posthumously', 'John', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'are', 'lot', 'music', 'footage', 'included', 'what', 'impressed', 'fact', 'producers', 'DVD', 'were', 'kind', 'enough', 'include', 'mostly', 'full', 'performances', 'classic', 'songs', 'various', 'concerts', 'footage', 'rare', 'not', 'seen', 'before.It', 'enjoyable', 'show', 'well', 'paced', 'Pete', 'extraordinary', 'man', 'vision', 'Tommy', 'well', 'told', 'here.The', 'bonus', 'footage', 'TV', 'special', 'Who', 'did', 'Germany', '1969', 'highlighting', 'best', 'songs', 'Tommy', 'long', 'music', 'clip', 'B', 'W', 'unfortunately', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'better', 'colour.Overall', 'worthy', 'DVD', 'love', 'Who']",Sensation - The Story of The Who's Tommy

Though the copyright at the end of the (approx) 90 minute documentary says 2013, it is not being released until March 11, 2014. With an additional 32 minutes of ""Bonus material""  (more on that in a minute) there is nearly two hours of material here to delight any fan of The Who, especially fans of their rock opera ""Tommy"".Every living person connected with the project is interviewed here, from really lengthy, insightful comments by Pete Townshend, who concieved of the idea and wrote nearly all the songs and Roger Daltrey (the lead singer who admits to life being harder after ""Tommy "" was released and the Who started playing 120,000 seat stadiums). Archival interviews from the late John Entwhisle are here as well. The artist who designed the Lp jacket, the sound  engineer and the group's manager during this period are here also. There comments from Townshend's biographer, critic Anthony Decurtis (who seems to be interviewed in nearly every rock doc I've seen) and Jann Wenner, the cocky founder of Rolling Stone. And there are clips from many performances of the opera. It was truly - as the film's title says - a ""sensation"".The bonus material consists of eight songs from ""Tommy"" as well interview segments from a 1969 episode of the German TV pop/rock show ""Beat Club"". It's in  black and white and BC always used weird video effects to give things a ""psychedelic"" touch. Still, a nice bonus.The images and sound on the BD are great. The BC material probably looks just as great on the DVD version.As I said above, this is something all Who fans will want to see and own.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,"NEW BD Documentary tells the full story of ""Tommy"" from Pete Townshen's mind through the Broadway production - nice bonus too!",1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,1778,"['fine', 'original', 'documentary', 'going', 'direct', 'DVD', 'BD', 'Eagle', 'Rock', 'Entertainment', 'copyright', 'end', 'approx', '90', 'minute', 'documentary', '2013', 'not', 'being', 'released', 'March', '11', '2014', 'additional', '32', 'minutes', 'Bonus', 'material', 'more', 'minute', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'material', 'here', 'delight', 'fan', 'Who', 'especially', 'fans', 'rock', 'Tommy', '.Every', 'living', 'person', 'connected', 'project', 'interviewed', 'here', 'really', 'lengthy', 'insightful', 'comments', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'who', 'concieved', 'idea', 'wrote', 'nearly', 'songs', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'lead', 'singer', 'who', 'life', 'being', 'harder', 'Tommy', 'was', 'released', 'Who', 'started', 'playing', '120,000', 'seat', 'stadiums', 'Archival', 'interviews', 'late', 'John', 'Entwhisle', 'are', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'artist', 'who', 'designed', 'Lp', 'jacket', 'sound', 'engineer', 'group', 'manager', 'period', 'are', 'here', 'also', 'comments', 'Townshend', 'biographer', 'critic', 'Anthony', 'Decurtis', 'who', 'be', 'interviewed', 'nearly', 'rock', 'doc', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Jann', 'Wenner', 'cocky', 'founder', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'are', 'clips', 'many', 'performances', 'opera', 'was', 'truly', 'film', 'title', 'sensation', '.The', 'bonus', 'material', 'eight', 'songs', 'Tommy', 'as', 'well', 'interview', 'segments', '1969', 'episode', 'German', 'TV', 'pop/rock', 'show', 'Beat', 'Club', 'black', 'white', 'BC', 'always', 'used', 'weird', 'video', 'effects', 'give', 'things', 'psychedelic', 'touch', 'Still', 'nice', 'bonus.The', 'images', 'sound', 'BD', 'are', 'great', 'BC', 'material', 'probably', 'just', 'as', 'great', 'DVD', 'version.As', 'said', 'above', 'something', 'Who', 'fans', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'own.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Sensation - The Story of The Who's Tommy

This album was the turning point of The Who and this bio does a great job at explaining it .Pete and Roger give recent interveiws , John and Keith archival . The bluray picture and sound quality are fantastic (as expected) . I would have liked to hear more of the music in between interveiws but this is a bio and not a music video . Roger Daltrey is never used enough in these Who documenturies , as he gives the best insights into how the band interpets Pete's songs . He is also able to take a step back and critique The Who as a fan . I would also liked if they covered more on the the movie Tommy , as I have heard conflicting reports that members of the band either hated the movie or loved  Ken Russell's interpretation .
