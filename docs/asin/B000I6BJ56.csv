What if they gave a war, and everyone said, ""Time out?""  Nevertheless, despite good will for Christmas, their determination to keep the olive branch going was smoldered by too  many outside forces to sustain a complete cease fire.  Hardly idealistic, they made a truce and intermingling amongst enemies until the final ""Auld Lang Syne"".  Four subjects are the focal point of the drama:  A famous German tenor who is a soldier (and his siren girlfriend) on the French front, a Scotish Anglican priest, and a French Lieutenant.  Inspiring and heart-mending, 'Joyeux Noel' (Merry Christmas) has the power to make us pause and believe that life without war could become a self-fulfilling prophecy if only we  would let it.  The very fact that the cease fire was brought about by music is itself an overpowering reminder of what we can all hold dear. (Garth Brooks made ""Belleau Wood"" from 'Sevens' about this event.)The extras are nice trimmings.  Director Christian Carion gives a revealing and concise interview in one of the DVD extras.  Although the movie is already set to go to English subtitles for the French and German trench scenes, I found you have to activate the English subtitles to follow along with the French director.  He does an excellent job of sorting through fact from conjecture, a satisfying task given the nature of historical fiction.

1019209,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000I6BJ56,Alistair McHarg,"[3, 4]","Joyeux Noel recounts an actual event that occurred on Christmas in 1914 - warring German, French, and Scottish soldiers took it upon themselves to ""take a day off from the fighting"" and generally hang out, drink, sing, and play a little soccer. The story has stayed around because of its innate surrealism and its poignancy.  But Joyeux Noel is not a cloying or sentimental movie; the event itself is more than enough to break your heart.What Joyeux Noel does really well is recreate the atmosphere of WWI trench battle.  In an age of ""point and click"" warfare, almost indistinguishable from video games, it is amazing to remember that a mere century ago war was a very personal, man-to-man enterprise.  The demarcation lines were close enough for an ambitious cat to ""work both sides of the street,"" begging table scraps from the Germans and then sauntering over to beg more from the Scots.  Soldiers fix bayonets onto the ends of their rifles, thereby doubling the killing power.  The death toll rises, the lines never seem to change.War is - of course, the ultimate declaration of failure, this is when humanity admits it has exhausted its imagination and must revert to the worst and most stupid of all remedies.  And yet, war has demonstrated remarkable staying power, despite its cost and destructive qualities.  As the documentary film - Why We Fight - observes, as long as there's that kind of money to be made from it, there will be war.  Consequently, the moment in Joyeux Noel when the pedestrian, commonplace insanity is violated to make way for an uncommon, brief step into spiritual sanity, had to be great - and it is.Perhaps not surprisingly it is music, the universal language, that provides the bridge.  The German tenor, a romantic and an idealist, is first to break the silence.  Silent night.  It is picked up by a Scottish piper - and no matter how you feel about the sound of pipes - they have an unearthly, eerie quality.  That contact is really all it takes, and soon these men discover they have far more to unite them than divide them.  One thing they all have in common is that their fate is being decided by fat old men drinking champagne in comfortable rooms.It was Keith Reid who said, ""Whatever you do, don't grin, you'll give the game away.""  And that is precisely the problem for these men.  The curtain has been lifted; they've all seen the embarrassed little fellow frantically pulling levers.  It will never be quite as easy to kill a man simply because he's wearing the wrong uniform, a point made very ironically by the death of a French soldier who has disguised himself as a German in order to do a favor for his commander.  The larger world, which runs on codified insanity, cannot abide this behavior.  Severe punishment is dished out all around, German soldiers are sent to the dreaded eastern front.  Order, and respect for authority, must be maintained.The movie succeeds because it approaches a bizarre, surreal event and treats it with respect, even if it does take some liberties with facts.  In so doing it makes the day-to-day routine of war, the butchering of next door neighbors, seem exactly as bizarre and otherworldly as it actually is, but never seems to be.",4,Temporary Sanity,1180742400,"06 2, 2007",2007,3215,"['Joyeux', 'Noel', 'actual', 'event', 'occurred', 'Christmas', '1914', 'warring', 'German', 'French', 'Scottish', 'soldiers', 'took', 'take', 'day', 'fighting', 'generally', 'hang', 'out', 'drink', 'sing', 'play', 'little', 'soccer', 'story', 'stayed', 'innate', 'surrealism', 'poignancy', 'Joyeux', 'Noel', 'not', 'cloying', 'sentimental', 'movie', 'event', 'more', 'enough', 'break', 'heart.What', 'Joyeux', 'Noel', 'really', 'well', 'recreate', 'atmosphere', 'WWI', 'trench', 'battle', 'age', 'point', 'click', 'warfare', 'almost', 'indistinguishable', 'video', 'games', 'amazing', 'remember', 'mere', 'century', 'war', 'was', 'very', 'personal', 'man-to-man', 'enterprise', 'demarcation', 'lines', 'were', 'close', 'enough', 'ambitious', 'cat', 'work', 'sides', 'street', 'begging', 'table', 'scraps', 'Germans', 'then', 'sauntering', 'beg', 'more', 'Scots', 'Soldiers', 'fix', 'bayonets', 'ends', 'rifles', 'thereby', 'doubling', 'killing', 'power', 'death', 'toll', 'lines', 'never', 'seem', 'change.War', 'course', 'ultimate', 'declaration', 'failure', 'when', 'humanity', 'exhausted', 'imagination', 'must', 'revert', 'worst', 'most', 'stupid', 'remedies', 'yet', 'war', 'demonstrated', 'remarkable', 'staying', 'power', 'cost', 'destructive', 'qualities', 'documentary', 'film', 'Why', 'Fight', 'observes', 'as', 'long', 'kind', 'money', 'be', 'made', 'will', 'be', 'war', 'Consequently', 'moment', 'Joyeux', 'Noel', 'when', 'pedestrian', 'commonplace', 'insanity', 'violated', 'make', 'way', 'uncommon', 'brief', 'step', 'spiritual', 'sanity', 'had', 'be', 'great', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'music', 'universal', 'language', 'bridge', 'German', 'tenor', 'romantic', 'idealist', 'first', 'break', 'silence', 'Silent', 'night', 'picked', 'up', 'Scottish', 'piper', 'matter', 'how', 'feel', 'sound', 'pipes', 'have', 'unearthly', 'eerie', 'quality', 'contact', 'really', 'soon', 'men', 'discover', 'have', 'far', 'more', 'unite', 'divide', 'One', 'thing', 'have', 'common', 'fate', 'being', 'decided', 'fat', 'old', 'men', 'drinking', 'champagne', 'comfortable', 'rooms.It', 'was', 'Keith', 'Reid', 'who', 'said', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'grin', ""'ll"", 'give', 'game', 'away', 'precisely', 'problem', 'men', 'curtain', 'been', 'lifted', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'embarrassed', 'little', 'fellow', 'frantically', 'pulling', 'levers', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'quite', 'easy', 'kill', 'man', 'simply', 'wearing', 'wrong', 'uniform', 'point', 'made', 'very', 'ironically', 'death', 'French', 'soldier', 'who', 'disguised', 'German', 'order', 'do', 'favor', 'commander', 'larger', 'world', 'codified', 'insanity', 'can', 'not', 'abide', 'behavior', 'Severe', 'punishment', 'dished', 'out', 'around', 'German', 'soldiers', 'are', 'sent', 'dreaded', 'eastern', 'front', 'Order', 'respect', 'authority', 'must', 'be', 'maintained.The', 'movie', 'bizarre', 'surreal', 'event', 'treats', 'respect', 'even', 'take', 'liberties', 'facts', 'so', 'doing', 'day-to-day', 'routine', 'war', 'butchering', 'next', 'door', 'neighbors', 'seem', 'exactly', 'bizarre', 'otherworldly', 'actually', 'never', 'be']",N/A

1019212,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B000I6BJ56,Andres C. Salama,"[0, 0]","A very good and moving French made film about the Christmas truce between the troops in the Western Front in 1914 during World War I. That day, English, French and German troops spontaneously stop shooting at each other and tentatively went to no man's land, where they end up exchanging gifts and even play an improvised soccer game. When superiors of all the countries involved learned about this, they naturally objected in the strongest terms about the fraternization, so an episode like this never happened again in the rest of the conflict (I first learned about this historical incident in the 1980s through Paul McCartney's video Pipes of Peace).Sentimental but never manipulative, pacifist but not terribly preachy, this film has a solid, old fashioned narrative style, as well as a very beautiful photography. It is also benefited by very fine performances, even if I'm not familiar with most of the actors. The only one I recognize was pretty Diane Kruger, as a Danish soprano visiting the German front to pass the time with her German lover, a fellow opera singer (her moving performance of Ave Maria in front of the troops is one of the highlights of the film, even if she was naturally dubbed by a real opera singer).

1019213,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B000I6BJ56,Anyechka,"[8, 11]","This is a very thoughtful and moving portrayal of one of the lesser-known events of WWI, the Christmas Truce of 1914.  I first learnt about it in my tenth grade European History AP class, and that the reason they never did anything like that again in wartime was because the soldiers just couldn't go back to shooting one another after they'd fraternised like that and gotten to know one another as human beings, friends, and not the one-dimensional monsters they'd been taught to hate.  Although fraternising took place in numerous spots along the front lines in France that Christmas, this film focuses on three specific units--one from France, one from Germany, and one from Scotland.  We get to know the men in all of these units before their three intersecting stories are finally all brought together for the holiday; it's not a simplistic portrayal of good guys vs. bad guys the way some other war movies do it.  And as it pointed out in the commentary by director Christian Carion, when the film was shown in Germany, many people were incredibly happy and grateful that for once they weren't shown as the bad guys and were shown very sympathetically, particularly with the story of the tenor Sprink and his Danish girlfriend Anna.  (And indeed, one of the reasons why so few people believed or took seriously the reports of Nazi atrocities during WWII was because all of those stories about marauding Huns hiding behind old women and children, bayoneting nuns, and crucifying babies during WWI turned out to be nothing but propaganda and outright fantasies.)The film opens with three different schoolboys, one British, one French, and one German, reciting actual propaganda that was used during WWI, in which they demonise the enemy and urge their compatriots to make war on them and show no mercy.  However, this prejudice quickly begins to fall away when the three units come together on Christmas Eve, moved by the beauty of Sprink's rendition of ""Stille Nacht,"" a song that would have been very familiar to the French and the Scots because the tune is the same even if the words are different in other languages.  They drink champagne together, hear Mass by the Scottish priest (though I was a bit surprised at how the Scottish regiment was Catholic, since the majority of Scots are Anglican or Presbyterian), and look at pictures of one another's families, all while discovering that they're more alike than they are different.  It's hard to hate someone and to believe in racist canards and jingoistic propaganda when one actually meets these people face to face and gets to know them as people, not stereotypes.  One can no longer separate people into self and other.  Though the truce was only to have been for Xmas Eve, it ends up extending into Xmas Day as well, when the three units come together again to bury their dead comrades who have been lying out in the open for weeks.  They play a soccer match and talk and get to know one another even more.  This truce worked so well, in fact, that it was hard for them to have to go back to the business of war again, which greatly displeases the higher-ups back at headquarters.  They were angry that all of these soldiers had fraternised with the enemy and didn't want to go back to shooting at one another.  If only the decisions about the war had been made by the ordinary soldiers experiencing the horror of the trenches and the camaraderie with the other side, in the true spirit of the holiday, peace might have come then instead of almost four whole years later.  Instead these life and death decisions were made by a bunch of officers who conducted the war from headquarters and a bunch of bureaucrats and monarchs far from the front lines, people who weren't exposed to combat, people who were in their comfortable homes and not experiencing the true reality of war.More than just a film about WWI or a Christmas-themed film, it also contains a powerful message about peace, love, and understanding.  Perhaps there would never be a need for war and hatred if only more people got to know those whom they considered different or evil, and found out they had the same hopes, fears, and life experiences, that they missed their families too, that they were heartbroken to lose their friends on the battlefield.  The only real difference between them was that they were wearing different uniforms.  World peace isn't an impossible dream; it's as simple as enough people deciding that they want it and no longer viewing those who are different as enemies.",4,An important story,1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,4525,"['very', 'thoughtful', 'moving', 'portrayal', 'one', 'lesser-known', 'events', 'WWI', 'Christmas', 'Truce', '1914', 'first', 'learnt', 'tenth', 'grade', 'European', 'History', 'AP', 'class', 'reason', 'never', 'did', 'anything', 'again', 'wartime', 'was', 'soldiers', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'shooting', 'one', ""'d"", 'fraternised', 'gotten', 'know', 'one', 'human', 'beings', 'friends', 'not', 'one-dimensional', 'monsters', ""'d"", 'been', 'taught', 'hate', 'fraternising', 'took', 'place', 'numerous', 'spots', 'front', 'lines', 'France', 'Christmas', 'film', 'three', 'specific', 'units', 'one', 'France', 'one', 'Germany', 'one', 'Scotland', 'get', 'know', 'men', 'units', 'three', 'intersecting', 'stories', 'are', 'finally', 'brought', 'together', 'holiday', 'not', 'simplistic', 'portrayal', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'way', 'other', 'war', 'movies', 'do', 'pointed', 'out', 'commentary', 'director', 'Christian', 'Carion', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'shown', 'Germany', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'incredibly', 'happy', 'grateful', 'once', 'were', ""n't"", 'shown', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'shown', 'very', 'sympathetically', 'particularly', 'story', 'tenor', 'Sprink', 'Danish', 'girlfriend', 'Anna', 'indeed', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'so', 'few', 'people', 'believed', 'took', 'seriously', 'reports', 'Nazi', 'atrocities', 'WWII', 'was', 'stories', 'marauding', 'Huns', 'hiding', 'old', 'women', 'children', 'bayoneting', 'nuns', 'crucifying', 'babies', 'WWI', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'nothing', 'propaganda', 'outright', 'fantasies', 'film', 'three', 'different', 'schoolboys', 'one', 'British', 'one', 'French', 'one', 'German', 'reciting', 'actual', 'propaganda', 'was', 'used', 'WWI', 'demonise', 'enemy', 'urge', 'compatriots', 'make', 'war', 'show', 'mercy', 'However', 'prejudice', 'quickly', 'fall', 'away', 'when', 'three', 'units', 'come', 'together', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'moved', 'beauty', 'Sprink', 'rendition', 'Stille', 'Nacht', 'song', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'familiar', 'French', 'Scots', 'tune', 'same', 'even', 'words', 'are', 'different', 'other', 'languages', 'drink', 'champagne', 'together', 'hear', 'Mass', 'Scottish', 'priest', 'was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'how', 'Scottish', 'regiment', 'was', 'Catholic', 'majority', 'Scots', 'are', 'Anglican', 'Presbyterian', 'look', 'pictures', 'one', 'families', 'discovering', ""'re"", 'more', 'alike', 'are', 'different', 'hard', 'hate', 'someone', 'believe', 'racist', 'canards', 'jingoistic', 'propaganda', 'when', 'one', 'actually', 'people', 'face', 'face', 'know', 'people', 'not', 'stereotypes', 'One', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'separate', 'people', 'self', 'other', 'truce', 'was', 'only', 'have', 'been', 'Xmas', 'Eve', 'up', 'extending', 'Xmas', 'Day', 'well', 'when', 'three', 'units', 'come', 'together', 'again', 'bury', 'dead', 'comrades', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'lying', 'out', 'open', 'weeks', 'play', 'soccer', 'match', 'talk', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'even', 'more', 'truce', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'fact', 'was', 'hard', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'business', 'war', 'again', 'greatly', 'higher-ups', 'back', 'headquarters', 'were', 'angry', 'soldiers', 'had', 'fraternised', 'enemy', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'back', 'shooting', 'one', 'only', 'decisions', 'war', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'ordinary', 'soldiers', 'experiencing', 'horror', 'trenches', 'camaraderie', 'other', 'side', 'true', 'spirit', 'holiday', 'peace', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'then', 'instead', 'almost', 'four', 'whole', 'years', 'later', 'Instead', 'life', 'death', 'decisions', 'were', 'made', 'bunch', 'officers', 'who', 'conducted', 'war', 'headquarters', 'bunch', 'bureaucrats', 'monarchs', 'far', 'front', 'lines', 'people', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'exposed', 'combat', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'comfortable', 'homes', 'not', 'experiencing', 'true', 'reality', 'war.More', 'just', 'film', 'WWI', 'Christmas-themed', 'film', 'also', 'powerful', 'message', 'peace', 'love', 'understanding', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'need', 'war', 'hatred', 'only', 'more', 'people', 'got', 'know', 'whom', 'considered', 'different', 'evil', 'found', 'had', 'same', 'hopes', 'fears', 'life', 'experiences', 'missed', 'families', 'too', 'were', 'heartbroken', 'lose', 'friends', 'battlefield', 'only', 'real', 'difference', 'was', 'were', 'wearing', 'different', 'uniforms', 'World', 'peace', ""n't"", 'impossible', 'dream', 'as', 'simple', 'enough', 'people', 'deciding', 'want', 'no', 'longer', 'viewing', 'who', 'are', 'different', 'enemies']",N/A

During autumn of 1914 Europe was enmeshed in a war (at the time called ""the Great War"") which proved to be the first global war - World War I.  Everyone involved thought this was going to be a walk-in-the park and by Christmastime the troops would be home.  Instead, Christmas 1914 found the soldiers on the western front on French territory not far from Paris (Germans, French, Scots, and English) locked in trench warfare tactics.  (American troops joined the allies only later in 1917).""Joyeux Noel"" (French for Merry Christmas) tells the story of the Scottish, French, and German troops who for one day and one night put down their weapons and joined each other's Christmas celebration and jubilation.  Such an importance Christmas played in the lives of these ordinary soldiers, that their common bond and their songs of ""peace on earth"" have actually broken the bonds of conforming hate and military uniformity.The cinematography of ""Joyeux Noel"" is great and there are also two love stories included (and make it more Hollywood-like).  The production of this movie was made by a mutual effort of French, German, British, Belgian, and Roumanian crews.  Noel in French means Christmas, in English is a Christmas Carol (""Noel, Noel"") and it originates from Latin 'natalis' which means birthday.  While this movie is not as informative as the History Channel's documentary on this unique event in military history (released in 2001), the movie's lesson for me is that Christmas has a powerful message - it's the celebration of the One called ""Prince of Peace.""",5,"The power of Christmas - ""Peace on Earth""",1168732800,"01 14, 2007",2007,1622,"['excellent', 'movie', 'real', 'historical', 'event', 'autumn', '1914', 'Europe', 'was', 'enmeshed', 'war', 'time', 'called', 'Great', 'War', 'proved', 'be', 'first', 'global', 'war', 'World', 'War', 'Everyone', 'involved', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'walk-in-the', 'park', 'Christmastime', 'troops', 'would', 'be', 'home', 'Instead', 'Christmas', '1914', 'found', 'soldiers', 'western', 'front', 'French', 'territory', 'not', 'far', 'Paris', 'Germans', 'French', 'Scots', 'English', 'locked', 'trench', 'warfare', 'tactics', 'American', 'troops', 'joined', 'allies', 'only', 'later', '1917', 'Joyeux', 'Noel', 'French', 'Merry', 'Christmas', 'story', 'Scottish', 'French', 'German', 'troops', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'one', 'night', 'put', 'down', 'weapons', 'joined', 'other', 'Christmas', 'celebration', 'jubilation', 'importance', 'Christmas', 'played', 'lives', 'ordinary', 'soldiers', 'common', 'bond', 'songs', 'peace', 'earth', 'have', 'actually', 'broken', 'bonds', 'conforming', 'hate', 'military', 'uniformity.The', 'cinematography', 'Joyeux', 'Noel', 'great', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'love', 'stories', 'included', 'make', 'more', 'Hollywood-like', 'production', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'mutual', 'effort', 'French', 'German', 'British', 'Belgian', 'Roumanian', 'crews', 'Noel', 'French', 'Christmas', 'English', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'Noel', 'Noel', 'Latin', 'birthday', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'informative', 'History', 'Channel', 'documentary', 'unique', 'event', 'military', 'history', 'released', '2001', 'movie', 'lesson', 'Christmas', 'powerful', 'message', 'celebration', 'One', 'called', 'Prince', 'Peace']",N/A

The story of spontaneous ""fraternizing"" between enemy soldiers during WWI on the front on Christmas in 1914 is like a hippie's dream come true. Soldiers laid down their arms and recognized the humanity in the men in the trench just yards away. They joined them in song, helped bury their dead and swapped addresses with their new friends - friends they were sworn to kill. The amazing thing is, it was true. Now it's inspired the French feature film Joyeux Noel, based on the photos and first-hand accounts of these fraternizations.The tale is told on the ground in war-torn France, with French and Scottish troops on one side and Germans on the other. The stage is set Christmas Eve when a German tenor sings, and the troops put their small Christmas trees on top of the trench. Soon, Scottish bagpipes join the Germans in a Christmas hymn, and the singer is swept away by the moment and marches out into no-man's land to place a Christmas tree. Commanders of the forces there - German, Scottish and French - meet and arrange a night's treaty. The troops come climbing out of their trenches, eventually drinking together, playing together, talking together. A midnight Mass is punctuated by distant bombs.In the morning, the new, war-scarred friends find something special has happened that forces commanding officers of all three armies back at their respective headquarters to disband these men. They won't shoot each other, and they even invite opposing forces into their trenches to hide from artillery fire.The astonishing thing is, it's mostly true, as writer-director Campion explains in an interview and in his commentary. The German tenor who brought applause from the opposing side and a truce to bury the dead is real. Men refused to shoot at the opposing side and were disbanded and sent elsewhere. And it happened not just Christmas Eve, 1914, but 1915 and 1916 as well. The movie opens, though, with a terrible truth. The Europeans and their governments had all been hating each other for a long time before the war. Campion starts the film with children singing sickeningly jingoistic songs about the evils of the other nations. These were songs learned years - even decades before - World War I ever started.DVD Extras: Aforementioned interview and commentary. Subtitles in English, Spanish and Portuguese.

1019222,A33G2XG1S5NSH1,B000I6BJ56,"Bryant Burnette ""Bryant Burnette""","[3, 5]","A nominee for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2006 Academy Awards, ""Joyeux Noel"" is a gem of a movie that is, in my opinion, an instant classic.It's based on accounts of fraternization between enemy troops that apparently happened a number of times during the First World War (a highly unofficial ceasefire negotiated between French, German, and Scottish troops on Christmas 1914).  It's highly fictionalized, of course, and a great many people have taken the filmmakers to task for ""adding"" too much sentiment.  What that spells to me is that some critics feel too many of the film's events were invented by the writer.However, this DVD includes a good interview with the director in which he talks candidly about how much of the film is based on historical record, and it turns out that a LOT more of it is real than even I might have thought.  The director even talks about some things that actually happened that he decided to leave out of the movie lest people find them too hard to believe!  I think that the sentiment, therefore, is entirely earned, and far from excessive.I rented the movie from Netflix, and the summary on the sleeve described the film as ""heartwarming.""  In a way, that's correct, but once the film was over, I felt more chilled than anything else.  Ultimately, what's going on in this movie is a story of how man's natural inclinations are toward peace, not war.  War, here, is presented as highly unnatural . . . something fought by the powerless at the uncaring behest of the powerful.  If you don't feel something like a cold hand on your shoulder by the end of the movie, I'm not sure we've seen the same thing; ""heartwarming"" is just NOT how I'd describe it.""Joyeux Noel"" reminds me somewhat of another great WW1 movie, Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory.""  And of course, ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" the Best Picture Oscar winner for 1930, is another terrific WW1 movie that is about as anti-war as one can find.  I'm not sure why I felt the need to mention that, but there you have it nonetheless.A couple of small caveats before I go:There are a few scenes in which the musical score is suddenly dropped in volume so that certain sound effects can be heard more prominently.  I'm going to assume, until someone tells me otherwise, that this is some sort of flaw in the DVD audio.  If not, if it was an artistic decision, then the man behind that decision needs to be spoken to, and sternly.  It doesn't ruin the movie . . . heck, it doesn't even ruin the few scenes it happens during.  But it IS sort of a glaring miscalculation.  I thought something had gone wrong with my speakers!Also, there is quite a bit of singing in the film, and the dubbing of the singing voices isn't all that well-done (the voices don't come even close to matching the lips in some instances).  This kind of thing happens pretty frequently in movies, but it's usually a bit more seamlessly achieved than it is here.  But hey, no harm, no foul.All in all, ""Joyeux Noel"" is an instant classic, one that I put on the list of the all-time great war movies.",5,the Oscar nomination was well-deserved,1169942400,"01 28, 2007",2007,3065,"['nominee', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', '2006', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Joyeux', 'Noel', 'gem', 'movie', 'opinion', 'instant', 'classic.It', 'based', 'accounts', 'fraternization', 'enemy', 'troops', 'apparently', 'happened', 'number', 'times', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'highly', 'unofficial', 'ceasefire', 'negotiated', 'French', 'German', 'Scottish', 'troops', 'Christmas', '1914', 'highly', 'fictionalized', 'course', 'great', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'taken', 'filmmakers', 'task', 'adding', 'too', 'much', 'sentiment', 'What', 'critics', 'feel', 'too', 'many', 'film', 'events', 'were', 'invented', 'writer.However', 'DVD', 'good', 'interview', 'director', 'candidly', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'based', 'historical', 'record', 'out', 'LOT', 'more', 'real', 'even', 'might', 'have', 'thought', 'director', 'even', 'talks', 'things', 'actually', 'happened', 'decided', 'leave', 'movie', 'lest', 'people', 'find', 'too', 'hard', 'believe', 'think', 'sentiment', 'therefore', 'entirely', 'earned', 'far', 'excessive.I', 'rented', 'movie', 'Netflix', 'summary', 'sleeve', 'described', 'film', 'heartwarming', 'way', 'correct', 'once', 'film', 'was', 'felt', 'more', 'chilled', 'anything', 'else', 'Ultimately', 'what', 'going', 'movie', 'story', 'how', 'man', 'natural', 'inclinations', 'are', 'peace', 'not', 'war', 'War', 'here', 'presented', 'highly', 'unnatural', 'something', 'fought', 'powerless', 'uncaring', 'behest', 'powerful', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'something', 'cold', 'hand', 'shoulder', 'end', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'same', 'thing', 'heartwarming', 'just', 'NOT', 'how', ""'d"", 'describe', 'Joyeux', 'Noel', 'somewhat', 'great', 'WW1', 'movie', 'Kubrick', 'Paths', 'Glory', 'course', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'winner', '1930', 'terrific', 'WW1', 'movie', 'as', 'anti-war', 'one', 'can', 'find', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'felt', 'need', 'mention', 'there', 'have', 'nonetheless.A', 'couple', 'small', 'caveats', 'go', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'musical', 'score', 'suddenly', 'dropped', 'volume', 'certain', 'sound', 'effects', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'more', 'prominently', ""'m"", 'going', 'assume', 'someone', 'tells', 'otherwise', 'sort', 'flaw', 'DVD', 'audio', 'not', 'was', 'artistic', 'decision', 'then', 'man', 'decision', 'be', 'spoken', 'sternly', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'movie', 'heck', ""n't"", 'even', 'ruin', 'few', 'scenes', 'sort', 'glaring', 'miscalculation', 'thought', 'something', 'had', 'gone', 'wrong', 'speakers', 'Also', 'quite', 'bit', 'singing', 'film', 'dubbing', 'singing', 'voices', ""n't"", 'well-done', 'voices', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'even', 'close', 'matching', 'lips', 'instances', 'kind', 'thing', 'happens', 'pretty', 'frequently', 'movies', 'usually', 'bit', 'more', 'seamlessly', 'achieved', 'here', 'hey', 'harm', 'foul.All', 'Joyeux', 'Noel', 'instant', 'classic', 'one', 'put', 'list', 'all-time', 'great', 'war', 'movies']",N/A

I was uncertain if the magic of the moment when enemy troops meet in No Man's Land would meet my expectations of reading about that even but I was more than satisfied.  Director Christian Carion has taken great care in bring true events faithfully to the screen.  In some cases, he slightly changed events but everything in his film happened at one time or another.  For example, women did visit the trenches so what Diane Kruger's character does by coming to stay with her husband is not fiction.  Also, there was an incident where a cat traveled between the lines that happened later in the war.  My favorite scene from the film is when Benno Furmann (who plays Sprink) sings Silent Night and gradually walks into No Man's Land holding one of the small Christmas trees given to the German troops.Joyeux Noel begins with children from Britain, France and Germany reciting actual propaganda that had been taught to them on how to hate their enemies, which is echoed at the end of the film when an Anglican Bishop (played by Ian Richardson) delivers a sermon to British troops about to engage the Germans on what a savage and cruel race they are and how they must all be killed.  However, when German, British (represented by a Scottish regiment) and French soldiers meet each other there is a break down of indoctrination and they accept each other as fellow human beings; hey trade items and look at pictures of  their wives and even play football.  The film has been accused of being overly sentimental but the events depicted are pretty much as they happened; some have commented that No Man's Land is too clean but this was still early in the war and the land between the trenches was to become far worse.The casting and performances are excellent.  Gary Lewis, who is best know from Gangs of New York and Billy Elliot, is marvelous as a Scottish village priest who volunteered to come to France to serve his parishioners who went to war.  My wife, who knew nothing about the Christmas truce, was drawn to the film and the message that what separates soldiers in time of war are pre-conceived notions that our enemy is evil, until we meet him.",5,The Christmas Truce,1165536000,"12 8, 2006",2006,2221,"['had', 'read', 'book', 'years', 'ago', 'concerning', 'Christmas', 'truce', '1914', 'was', 'uncertain', 'magic', 'moment', 'when', 'enemy', 'meet', 'No', 'Man', 'Land', 'would', 'meet', 'expectations', 'reading', 'even', 'was', 'more', 'satisfied', 'Director', 'Christian', 'Carion', 'taken', 'great', 'care', 'bring', 'true', 'events', 'faithfully', 'screen', 'cases', 'slightly', 'changed', 'events', 'everything', 'film', 'happened', 'one', 'time', 'example', 'women', 'did', 'visit', 'trenches', 'so', 'what', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'character', 'coming', 'stay', 'husband', 'not', 'fiction', 'Also', 'was', 'incident', 'where', 'cat', 'traveled', 'lines', 'happened', 'later', 'war', 'favorite', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'Benno', 'Furmann', 'who', 'Sprink', 'Silent', 'Night', 'gradually', 'walks', 'Man', 'Land', 'holding', 'one', 'small', 'Christmas', 'trees', 'given', 'German', 'troops.Joyeux', 'Noel', 'children', 'Britain', 'France', 'Germany', 'reciting', 'actual', 'propaganda', 'had', 'been', 'taught', 'how', 'hate', 'enemies', 'echoed', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'Anglican', 'Bishop', 'played', 'Ian', 'Richardson', 'sermon', 'British', 'troops', 'engage', 'Germans', 'what', 'savage', 'cruel', 'race', 'are', 'how', 'must', 'be', 'killed', 'However', 'when', 'German', 'British', 'represented', 'Scottish', 'regiment', 'French', 'soldiers', 'meet', 'other', 'break', 'down', 'indoctrination', 'accept', 'other', 'fellow', 'human', 'beings', 'trade', 'items', 'look', 'pictures', 'wives', 'even', 'play', 'football', 'film', 'been', 'accused', 'being', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'events', 'depicted', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'happened', 'have', 'commented', 'Man', 'Land', 'too', 'clean', 'was', 'still', 'early', 'war', 'land', 'trenches', 'was', 'become', 'far', 'worse.The', 'casting', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'Gary', 'Lewis', 'who', 'best', 'know', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'marvelous', 'Scottish', 'village', 'priest', 'who', 'volunteered', 'come', 'France', 'serve', 'parishioners', 'who', 'went', 'war', 'My', 'wife', 'who', 'knew', 'nothing', 'Christmas', 'truce', 'was', 'drawn', 'film', 'message', 'what', 'soldiers', 'time', 'war', 'are', 'pre-conceived', 'notions', 'enemy', 'evil', 'meet']",N/A
1019233,AECVYXIL9791R,B000I6BJ56,David C. Read,"[2, 2]","This film is a fictional amalgam of several true incidents in which soldiers in opposite trenches in the First World War spontaneously arranged temporary truces or cease fires.  Most of these events occurred at Christmas, 1914, but there were several similar truces throughout the war.  In this film, a German line faces a French unit and a Scottish unit, on Christmas eve, 1914.  When a German opera singer begins singing ""Silent Night,"" the Scottish bagpipes join in from the opposing trenches.  The commanding officers decide that there will be general truce, during which the dead in no-man's land will be buried.  Soon, there is general fraternization.  There were no strong ideological barriers, and great deal of Western Culture in common.  (On pain of death, I could not tell you what the First World War was about, or why it was necessary, and I'm sure the soldiers at the time were just as mystified.)The higher ups are horrified when they learn about this, and take steps to make sure similar humanity does not crop up again.  Eventually, the German troops are sent to the Russian front without being allowing to get off the train in Germany.  Even the chaplains preach sermons aimed at convincing the troops that God is on their side and that the enemy is the barbarous hun.One false note is that the Scottish troops have a Catholic priest for a chaplain, although at that time the vast majority of Scots were Presbyterians (Calvinists).  On the other hand, there probably were some Catholic chaplains among the Scottish troops.  Also the trenches seem impossibly close together, but there were places along the front were the opposing trenches were only 40 yards apart, so this isn't necessarily unrealistic.Be sure to watch the bonus feature interview with the French director.

The story revolves around a Scottish priest caught up in the drama, two German opera singers caught between love and patriotism, and a French lieutenant missing his pregnant, sick wife. Other characters are included as the movie meanders toward the momentous evening on December 24, 1914. For American audiences raised on constant drama, this might seem to lack fireworks; yet the ideas here are potent, made all the more so by their basis in fact. When one man makes a simple sacrifice for the sake of his superior, he pays a price that underlines the irony of war.In conclusion, the movie is a moving tribute to men of three nations who saw past hate and political intrigue long enough to share in their humanity.

Normally I don't care for movies that try to tell me how horrible war is. How stupid do they think people are? ""It is bad when people are killed"" or ""war is horrible"" the movies tell us. Oh really? Well thank you Captain Obvious. ""Joyeux Noel"" takes an entirely different approach.Would you want to kill someone with whom you had shared a glass of champagne just minutes earlier? Would you want to kill someone who had been on your soccer team just minutes earlier? Would you want to kill someone who had just given you a chocolate bar and returned your lost wallet? When was the last time you heard questions like that asked in a war movie. I'm going to bet never.This movie is the true story about the Christmas truce in December of 1914. The Scots, The French and the Germans all laid down arms Christmas eve and Christmas day. It started out with each side singing Christmas carols and ended up with the soldiers on all sides joining on the battlefield to exchange food and drink, play cards, play soccer, and on and on.You know how when you are traveling and you meet someone who is from your hometown, or you meet someone who is friends with one of your friends, there is this almost instant bond created? That's what this movie is all about. Its about soldiers coming face to face with ""the enemy"" and finding friends. The ultimate ""anti-war"" sentiment lies in knowing that under different circumstances you would be good friends with the people you are trying to kill.One of the more interesting (and sad) parts of the movie is how the war officials on all sides responded to the Christmas truce. But you'll have to watch the movie yourself to see what happened.There is not much action or violence in this movie; if that is what you are looking for you should go somewhere else.

It is an unusual look at the insanity that was World War I, a war that from my viewpoint had no appreciable gain to be made from the aggressors, and of course the soldiers and the citizens suffered. An example of the crazy things is a scene where the German Kaiser orders that Christmas trees be sent to the battlefront and spaced every 3 meters or some such. Men had no ammunition or supplies, but Christmas trees were sent.The Crux of the story is on Christmas Eve, a famous German Opera tenor, is recalled from the front where he is serving as an infantry soldier, to do a command performance for the German Royalty. After he performs he is granted a brief time with his wife, but he tells her he must go sing for his unit. Then his wife insist on accompanying him and what ensues from his performance is an ad hoc cease fire between the three warring factions, Germany led ironically by a Jewish Officer,  the French, and the  Scot-English. What the men find through this illegal truce is, they have much more in common than they have differences.So here's the deal, most of the movie is in sub-titles; personally, I think that adds to the effect, some may find it distracting.

1019244,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000I6BJ56,Grady Harp,"[21, 22]","Writer/director Christian Carion ('Une hirondelle a fait le printemps' aka 'The Girl from Paris') is unafraid to write and create cinematic tales that touch the heart as well as the mind.  'Joyeux Nol' is a story of war and its effects on soldiers that goes far beyond sentimentality (or the opposite emphasis on brutality as found in American films) and offers the viewer insights to the responses of young men's minds to the monster of war and how they cope.Based on a true story, the film opens with the usual callous killing among three groups of soldiers - German, French, and Scottish - who face an oncoming Christmas Eve in the trenches, the realities of fighting have precluded their getting time to retreat for air.  But a miracle happens: among the Germans is a famous opera tenor Nikolaus Sprink (Benno F&uuml;rmann) who has aligned with his fellow troops in the trenches, hoping he can bring some minor sense of Christmas and understanding to them.  His soprano partner Anna Sorensen (Diane Kruger) finds a way to be with him in the trenches on Christmas Eve, 1914.  Meanwhile the disgruntle troops of all three sectors are planning meager festivities and a bit of relaxation even in the trenches as the bodies of the day's plunder lie in the snow of no man's land.  We get to know the French Lieutenant Audebert (Guillaume Canet) and his orderly Ponchel (Dany Boon), the German head of the regiment Horstmayer (Daniel Br&uuml;hl), and the Scots - especially the priest/medic Palmer (Gary Lewis).Christmas Eve comes and the voice of Sprink (in reality the tenor Rolando Villaz&oacute;n) sings 'Stille Nacht', rising out of the trenches to sing in the open of no man's land.  Soon he is accompanied by the Scottish bagpipes and the 'chorus' of the Germans, the Scots and the French.  They all emerge, share gifts of champagne and other libations, and agree to a cease-fire in honor of the holiday.  It is in this magic moment that the true personalities of these warring men surface and each is seen as a vulnerable puppet of the WW I, exchanging addresses to meet after the war.  Anna Sorenson has managed to enter the scene and during a communal mass led by Palmer she sings (the voice is Natalie Dessay) an Ave Maria (composed by the film's composer Philippe Rombi): the lovers have previously sung a duet version of Bach's 'Bist du bei mir'.  For that moment in time the horrors of war melt and the camaraderie of the men glows and is carried into Christmas Day when all three groups of soldiers agree to bury their dead together.  Of course the brutality and ignorance of war re-engages and the leaders of the three groups enter camp and threaten courts martial and punishment for the troops' lack of military discipline.  The film ends in a manner that leaves the audience able to integrate the happenings of that Christmas Eve on the futures of these men.The script is superb, the cast is uniformly excellent, the sets and cinematography are creatively moody, and the musical score by  Philippe Rombi is one of the finest in years: the ending song 'I'm Dreaming of Home' deserves to become a standard.  Would that everyone could see this film, a bit of global hope in the cloud of the destruction that shadows our world right now.  Highly recommended.

One I will review, and one I will mention and give you a link to go to for more information.In spite of all the ills that Man brings to himself and to others, with all of his hatred, unconcern, and ill will toward others of different nationalities and beliefs, there is the reaffirming nature of his sense of ""right"" and ""love for others"", an inborn ""goodness"" that can, and will, shine through. This is a film of such a case, although it is for a brief ""Evening and a Day"" (due to the circumstances between countries at the time of this ""story"").Based on true events, well documented in many cases, this insight into Christmas, 1914, will re-affirm your belief in man's goodness towards his fellow man.This is, truly, a magnificent, beautiful film. The cinematography is just breathtaking in many scenes, and the score is wonderful...it will move you, deeply. All characters and the acting of those portraying those characters are believable, and ""right""...everything looking just as you would expect them to look in those times, in that place...no-man's-land, Christmas Eve/Christmas Day, 1914, ""somewhere"" along the Western Front.There are many cases of documented ""fraternization"" between enemy troops both in World War One, and also in World War Two, and I ask you, ""How wondrously touching and reaffirming in Man's Goodness to Each Other...his ""fellow man"" this is---No?"" There are, naturally, the ""behind the scenes"" looks into everyone's lives, but the focal point is Christmas Eve and Christmas Day on the nether land between the German and Allied Troops, where after the Scottish Regiment sings carols, which brings the other country's men to join in and then, step out into the open and share these precious and so short hours, sharing and being together with each other, the hours of Christmas. This leads to a cease-fire for Christmas Day, whereby they all join in, together, sorting out the dead, and helping each other bury their own, in true brotherhood. I defy anyone NOT to be touched to the core of his heart by this wonderful film.I sincerely hope that I have been able to convince you to see this wonderful film. It would be such a shame not to experience it.Because I find the score/soundtrack so wonderful for this film, I send you here to it's listing:Merry Christmas (Joyeux Nol)In passing, I feel it my duty to draw your attention, also, to another truly great film, in somewhat the same vein, ""A Midnight Clear"", with similar interaction during World War Two. This is another ""must-see"" film, which you can read reviews about here:A Midnight ClearAlso, hopefully, you will also wish to check out ""A Midnight Clear""...however, in checking the link, I fear that it has gone out of print...in which case, at least hunt for a copy to borrow or rent, or pick up a used copy if you can locate one reasonably.

Thanks to Roger Ebert for campaigning it to get the correct rating.One thing my dad mentioned was whether the Scottish priest was Catholic or Anglican.  I would say the former for three reasons:  1) he gave mass in Latin; 2) there was a shot of a statue of Mary when he was first introduced, and 3) he mentioned praying for a deceased soldier; this would preclude a belief in purgatory -- as a non-purgatory believer, I feel the dead are in heaven where they are in no need of prayers or in hell where they are past the deliverance of prayers.Jeff",5,"A Very Effective Movie, Teaching True Tolerance.",1198800000,"12 28, 2007",2007,1288,"['saw', 'movie', 'fittingly', 'Christmas', 'great', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'be', 'put', 'same', 'tradition', 'Wonderful', 'Life', '.This', 'French', 'movie', 'German', 'Scotch', 'characters', 'speak', 'own', 'languages', 'movie', 'subtitled.It', 'inspired', 'occurance', 'where', 'Christmas', '1914', 'WWI', 'soldiers', 'fraternized', 'not', 'based', 'event', 'real', 'people', 'are', 'represented.This', 'movie', 'children', 'echoing', 'hatred', 'showing', 'hatred', 'three', 'camps', 'overcoming', 'hatred', 'cost', 'letting', 'go', 'hatred', 'worth', 'it.This', 'movie', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'definitely', 'rating', 'opposed', 'R', 'MPAA', 'wanted', 'give', 'Thanks', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'campaigning', 'get', 'correct', 'rating.One', 'thing', 'dad', 'mentioned', 'was', 'Scottish', 'priest', 'was', 'Catholic', 'Anglican', 'would', 'say', 'former', 'three', 'reasons', '1', 'gave', 'mass', 'Latin', '2', 'was', 'shot', 'statue', 'Mary', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'introduced', '3', 'mentioned', 'praying', 'deceased', 'soldier', 'would', 'preclude', 'belief', 'purgatory', 'non-purgatory', 'believer', 'feel', 'dead', 'are', 'heaven', 'where', 'are', 'need', 'prayers', 'hell', 'where', 'are', 'deliverance', 'prayers.Jeff']",N/A

1019253,A3160YSU1KRL8E,B000I6BJ56,Justin Playfair,"[4, 4]","I first heard about this event as a young boy reading ""Enemy Ace"" comics. The event was given a unique treatment in that comic strip about a German Air Ace in World War I and the story was repeated on several occasions as the character recalled it. I was impressed at the time and being unfamiliar with life and faith, did not fully understand the implication. Then a chance purchase in a bookstore of a book called ""Silent Night"" by Stanley Weintraub, filled out the particulars. Well, I was overjoyed when it was announced that this movie was being made. Now that I have seen the entire picture in the comfort of my parlor it struck me once again that this war was a type of Christian Civil War, fought by underclasses for an argument not well understood even today. Indeed Ms. Tuchman's Guns of August spent time in that area and we still cannot completely explain it. Yet, on that miraculous Christmas Eve in 1914, common men abandoned their trenches to meet in the middle of no-man's land to sing hymms and (in this movie) attend a ""midnight mass"". This accent on the Christian roots of all sides involved projects fully the great tragedy that became the Europe of the 20th century. Mass, being in Latin, was understood by all despite French, German and English origins. It is a moving moment in a moving picture and shows us what was truly lost by this war. A connection with God and humanity. Of course, the movie shows that the soldiers who called a truce were punished and relocated, but the event should never be forgotten, nor the men who were brave enough to come together as a brotherhood on what was back then truly a sacred night above the realm of man. With the winters of life now passed as many, I understand that Shakespeare said it best in ""Hamlet"" (Act 1, Scene 1)when Horatio is gathered on the battlements with Marcellus and Bernardo on the last watch of the night Marcellus: ""Some say, that ever against that season comes wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, The bird of dawning singeth all night long; And then, they say, no spirit can walk abroad; The nights are wholesome then, no planets strike, no fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm; So hallowed and so gracious is the time"" To which Horatio answers: ""So have I heard, and do in part believe it.""

Soldiers exchanged cigarettes and alcohol, played football (soccer), and allowed the removal and burial of dead soldiers from the frozen tundra of no mans land. ""Joyeux Noel"", a French-made film with an international cast directed by Christian Carion, is a fictionalized account of this truce. It is a wonderful film that in its own way stands with or close Stanley Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory"" as one of the great films about the horrors of what has come to be known as the First World War.The film opens in the days and years before the start of the ""Great War"". We see British (in this instance Scottish), French, and German schoolchildren absorbing lessons in Kiplingesque nationalism and empire-building that taught each group that God was on their side and demonized the evil German, Briton, or French. After a quick introduction to the main characters the war begins in all its brutality. The Scottish and French troops rise up from their trenches and are mowed down by German machine-gunners. The dead and wounded are left in no-mans land. At the same time we see the respective high commands, enjoying the comfort of life war out of harms way. As night falls on Christmas Eve, German soldiers place small Christmas trees atop their trenches. A bagpiper plays a Christmas tune and the German soldiers applaud. A German enlisted man, a well-known singer (the relationship between the soldier and his Danish wife, also a singer form the basis of much of the plot) rises out of the trenches to sing Silent Night.""Still through the cloven skies they comewith peaceful wings unfurled,and still their heavenly music floatso'er all the weary world;above its sad and lowly plainsthey bend on hovering wing,and ever o'er its Babel-soundsthe blessed angels sing.""It is said that music hath charms to sooth the savage heart and in short order the German, French, and Scottish squad leaders (the ""Three Wise Men""?) meet to discuss a short truce. The truce takes on a life of its own and forms the centerpiece of the rest of the film. The interaction amongst the soldiers is well crafted and well acted. There are even light moments as a stray dog routinely crosses the field of battle to take food from whatever army wishes to feed it. The cinema photography is lush without detracting from the story line. The songs sung by the soldiers as they observe the holiday truce are compelling. In the context of a war, even during a truce, the words to hymns of peace are tragically ironic. The words of peace must have been comforting but it is a comfort born of stolen moments and director Carion does an excellent job conveying the all too temporary nature of this reprieve.""Yet with the woes of sin and strifethe world has suffered long;beneath the heavenly hymn have rolledtwo thousand years of wrong;and warring humankind hears notthe tidings which they bring;O hush the noise and cease your strifeand hear the angels sing!""The film shows us the aftermath of the truce, the reaction of the high commands and it is these moments that bring Paths of Glory to mind.Joyeux Noel is a beautifully drawn and acted film that very much deserved (and perhaps should have won) its Oscar, Golden Globe, and BAFTA nominations.

The viewer is introduced to these men, who in turn become acquainted with each other - this was pulled off so beautifully it could be nothing but a tribute to the actual soldiers who had the courage in their hearts to disobey orders in the spirit of honouring Christmas.The first hour and a half had me in awe that such a movie would even be produced in this day and age. It was a powerful commentary on European unity - Scottish, British, Germans, French coming together despite their governments, and seeing the other side as individuals and fellow Europeans. Aside from that, Joyeux Noel is no Christmas feel good movie. On the contrary, its realistic portrayals of death on the battlefield and the general senselessness of it all gave it a bittersweet tinge. Because of this, a profound message in the spirit of the season could have been derived from it, but unfortunately, about 3/4 of the way in, everything falls apart.One expects more than a few liberties to be taken when converting historical events into a fictionalized account, and in fact the many that were included only served to make the message more profound. Except, once Christmas day has passed, and the truce is over, everything fell apart so horribly I was left to wonder if this was even the same movie.Anyone with half a functioning brain could gather that the sole reason the European troops were unified at all was because of a shared religion which brought them together. And in those days, when the Mass was still read in Latin, so too, for a time, did they share a common language. But then, cue Evil Bishop, who relieves the Scottish parish priest from his wartime duties and intimates that this regiment will be disbanded and scattered into more dangerous situations because of his liturgical reading on Christmas. Said Bishop then begins quoting Matthew 10:34 out of context and with his other statements about wars being a ""Crusade"" fought for good vs. evil, the film is not only politicized, the lesson those actual young men fighting a horrific war in 1914 attempted to temporarily convey is flushed down the toilet. Humanity had more sense and intelligence a century ago, I begin to think.Does the director not realize entire raison d'etre, so to speak, for the events in 1914 was because these men who were desperate for normalcy in the midst of a war that saw artillery the likes of which no other soldier in the history of the world had ever been faced with, took the chance for unification and peace on Christmas day? You know, when Christ was born. According to the Christian religion. Which the director then proceeds to portray as hypocritical and warmongering. When it was the Christians fighting on the Western Front who called a cease fire because of their beliefs. Why does Amazon have no appropriate facepalm emoticons for situations such as these?In my estimation, the majority of this movie was superb. To see one side mourning for the other made a profound statement, but the sex scenes, constant military defiance and mocking of authority, sympathizing with desertion, and very confounding anti-Chistian sentiment (in a Christmas movie... seriously? Can we say new low?) it at times displayed, I have to cross this one off my list.

Soldiers tried to capture the enemies' trench by crawling on their stomachs across 'no-man's land' and surprising the other side or just plain attacking and hoping to overpower them with numbers and force. Much of the fighting was fought at very close range with bayonets or rifles. Living in the trenches during the winter was especially bitter with the cold and snow. But in 1914 something happened that showed that the power of Christmas and the Prince of Peace can overcome (at least for the moment) the hatred and fighting. It was an amazing evening under the stars as enemies came together in worship and fellowship and dropped their weapons to recognize there is One who has come and will come again to bring peace to the world and overcome all the differences that currently separate men from one another. The film personalizes the story through the lives of four people showing their lives before the war and how they arrived at the same place on earth that same night. A very inspiring movie about the true meaning of Christmas and 'Peace On Earth'.",5,"PEACE ON EARTH, GOODWILL TO ALL MEN!!",1230163200,"12 25, 2008",2008,1455,"['Based', 'true', 'story', 'took', 'place', 'Christmas', 'Day', '1914', 'WWI', 'film', 'worst', 'best', 'human', 'spirit', 'one', 'hand', 'brutality', 'insanity', 'war', 'see', 'men', 'trenches', 'literally', 'being', 'sacrificed', 'calling', 'shots', 'comfort', 'headquarters', 'Trench', 'warfare', 'was', 'brutal', 'trenches', 'were', 'separated', 'only', '50-100', 'yards', 'Soldiers', 'tried', 'capture', 'enemies', 'trench', 'crawling', 'stomachs', ""'no-man"", 'land', 'surprising', 'other', 'side', 'just', 'plain', 'attacking', 'hoping', 'overpower', 'numbers', 'force', 'Much', 'fighting', 'was', 'fought', 'very', 'close', 'range', 'bayonets', 'rifles', 'Living', 'trenches', 'winter', 'was', 'especially', 'bitter', 'cold', 'snow', '1914', 'something', 'happened', 'showed', 'power', 'Christmas', 'Prince', 'Peace', 'can', 'overcome', 'least', 'moment', 'hatred', 'fighting', 'was', 'amazing', 'evening', 'stars', 'enemies', 'came', 'together', 'worship', 'fellowship', 'dropped', 'weapons', 'recognize', 'One', 'who', 'come', 'will', 'come', 'again', 'bring', 'peace', 'world', 'overcome', 'differences', 'currently', 'separate', 'men', 'one', 'film', 'story', 'lives', 'four', 'people', 'showing', 'lives', 'war', 'how', 'arrived', 'same', 'place', 'earth', 'same', 'night', 'very', 'inspiring', 'movie', 'true', 'meaning', 'Christmas', 'Earth']",N/A

Due to the great chivalitry of the troup comanders, that each in his own way represents the best of their cultures, a friendly truce takes place and continues during the following days, until the leading authorities (generals, bishops and fathers) discover what is considered the worse possible form of treason, ""fraternization""!The moving and supremely inspiring moment of the movie is the Mass, officiated by a Scottish clergyman (Gary Lewis), during which the ""Ave Maria"" is sung, but music intended as an emotional force, like the Christian ideals that then governed society, are present and at work all the time.All the characters are very well etched and the actors are appropriately chosen. There are many marginal episodes that give a flavour of simple and suffering humanity, that however doesn't loose its dignity or sense of humor.Revisionism of WWI historiography has been going on now for sometime, and the current opinion of the mass massacre wanted by economical/national powers is now well accepted. This movie does not dwell on such a modern concept, but somehow is born not only from this modern idea of history but also from the construction of a united European Nation.Carion describes a beautiful and maybe sentimental episode but goes deep into its genesis and meaning, making this way a miliary movie that enriches young and old.",5,"Europe's Christian and Musical Roots, then and now",1162857600,"11 7, 2006",2006,2012,"['Watching', 'delightful', 'deep', 'orginal', 'movie', 'suddenly', 'realized', 'why', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'when', 'European', 'Constitution', 'failed', 'mention', 'Christianity', 'one', 'founding', 'pillars', 'Europe.Based', 'true', 'episode', 'took', 'place', 'Christmas', 'Eve', '1914', 'probably', 'was', 'repeated', 'other', 'similar', 'occasions', 'Western', 'Front', 'France', 'Christian', 'Carion', 'up', 'Christmas', 'tale', 'out', 'common', 'ideals', 'beliefs', 'British', 'Scots', 'French', 'German', 'soldiers.In', 'hell', 'opposing', 'trenches', 'Christmas', 'chant', 'longing', 'sadness', 'expecially', 'friendship', 'allied', 'Scots', 'French', 'German', 'enemies', 'Due', 'great', 'chivalitry', 'troup', 'comanders', 'own', 'way', 'best', 'cultures', 'friendly', 'truce', 'place', 'following', 'days', 'leading', 'authorities', 'generals', 'bishops', 'fathers', 'discover', 'what', 'considered', 'worse', 'possible', 'form', 'treason', 'fraternization', 'moving', 'supremely', 'inspiring', 'moment', 'movie', 'Mass', 'officiated', 'Scottish', 'clergyman', 'Gary', 'Lewis', 'Ave', 'Maria', 'sung', 'music', 'intended', 'emotional', 'force', 'Christian', 'ideals', 'then', 'governed', 'society', 'are', 'present', 'work', 'time.All', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'etched', 'actors', 'are', 'appropriately', 'chosen', 'are', 'many', 'marginal', 'episodes', 'give', 'flavour', 'simple', 'suffering', 'humanity', 'however', ""n't"", 'loose', 'dignity', 'sense', 'humor.Revisionism', 'WWI', 'historiography', 'been', 'going', 'now', 'sometime', 'current', 'opinion', 'mass', 'massacre', 'wanted', 'economical/national', 'powers', 'now', 'well', 'accepted', 'movie', 'not', 'dwell', 'modern', 'concept', 'somehow', 'born', 'not', 'only', 'modern', 'idea', 'history', 'also', 'construction', 'united', 'European', 'Nation.Carion', 'beautiful', 'maybe', 'sentimental', 'episode', 'deep', 'genesis', 'meaning', 'making', 'way', 'miliary', 'movie', 'young', 'old']",N/A

Unfortunately the Bureaucrats and Politicians react to this spur-of-the-moment camaraderie among the different factions as they usually do: they condemn the participants and accuse them of treason.All of the actors do a fine job of creating characters who genuinely feel like they are fighting for ideals and ideas that will have a lasting effect on their lives and that of their children. They are committed. They are also of course, innocent.The ethereal Diane Kruger plays a classical singer, a Swede and therefore neutral but married to a German soldier who, through some personal machinations as well as a pass from Kaiser Wilhelm finds herself on the battlefield on that special night of 12/24/1914.

1019276,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000I6BJ56,mirasreviews,"[8, 9]","""Joyeux Noel"" celebrates the amity of the holiday season in a manner unlike other Christmas movies. It takes place on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day 1914, somewhere along the German-French line in Northern France during World War I. The film is based on the famous ""Christmas truce"" that occurred in several locations along the front lines during WWI, during which French, German, and British soldiers fraternized with their enemies, briefly enjoying their kinship and, in some cases, planning to visit one another after the war. Some of the incidents in the film are true and some are fiction. In December 1914, the War was 4 months old, and expectations of a speedy resolution were fading. On the front, German and French trenches were only 100 meters apart, separated by a no-man's-land between, strewn with dead and dying men.In command of the French trench is Lieutenant Audebert (Guillaume Canet), whose home town is now behind the German line, preventing him from getting word from his pregnant wife. A Scottish force under Gordon (Alex Ferns) is supporting the French position, among them an Anglican priest (Gary Lewis) acting as a stretcher-bearer and his young parishioner (Steven Robertson), who has lost a brother. In the German trench, private Sprink (Benno Furmann), a world-famous tenor who lacks the temperament for battle, frustrates his commander Lieutenant Horstmayer (Daniel Bruhl). On Christmas Eve, Sprink's lover, the Danish soprano Anna Sorensen (Diane Kruger), arranges that Sprink be called away from the trenches to give a private concert for the German Kronprinz nearby. When Sprink returns to sing for the men, his voice carries over the snow to the other trenches, initiating a Christmas that no one will ever forget.In some ways, ""Joyeux Noel"" is fantastic and sentimental. Anna Sorensen is a fantasy character who brings grace, a different perspective, and beautiful song to the film. Some women did manage to visit their men in the trenches during World War I, but not opera singers in full evening dress. But the tensions and affinity between the 3 commanding officers are affecting. The audience shares their sense of relief and dread. The eerie beauty, both visual and auditory, of the war draped in snow and paused for the holiday, creates indelible images. Some of the most absurd of the film's images are based in fact -including the Christmas trees in the German trenches and the treasonous cat. ""Joyeux Noel"" is an engaging, beautiful film about a moment in the Great War that defied its brutality. The opera singers were dubbed by French soprano Natalie Dessay and Mexican tenor Rolando Villazon. In English, French, and German with subtitles.The DVD (Sony Pictures 2006): ""Interview with Director Christian Carion"" (16 min) is an interview session in which the writer/director answers questions about the historical basis for the film. This is good information, but the interview is in French and not subtitled. Most, but not all, of the information is also found in the audio commentary.

When the enemy also chooses not to kill the results are overwhelming and emotional. There is far more joy in peace than in war, even if that peace is short lived. This story shows just what can be done when the choice of both sides is to stop killing.

Perhaps the most memorable of these moments occured during the 1914 Christmas Truce.Joyeux Noel gives a glimpse of what the truce might have looked like along a small section of the Western Front. We know from history that such truces sprang up along the trenches and that one-time combatants greeted one another in a spirit of Christian brotherhood that couldn't last.The movie has plenty of lapses to be sure. Fake snow is fake snow and I really hate it. Actors never seem to be cold despite the apparent snow and wind...and of course they aren't. This is just a pet peeve of mine. The uniforms were not up to snuff, but probably only the critical eye will be disturbed by this. Overall the movie's focus is on the personal story and not really the war itself, which might be a mistake. Certainly more violence preceding the truce would have lent it even more meaning.The acting is first rate, the story telling is wonderful and Diane Kruger...well...I'd watch it just for her. It really is a good movie...not great...but still able to convey the central question that haunts us still from that amazing moment in NO-MAN's Land. And of course the question is ""Why are we killing each other?""WWI will always stand as a war so devoid of meaning and so horrific for its toll of human life. It says so many awful things about Western Society and it's inappropriate mixing of industrialized killing with religion and patriotism.

Like so many others, he never talked about his war experiences except the happy times when some French families entertained the American soldiers in their homes.The film shows in a moving but unsentimental way, the events that happened along the front one Christmas.  We see the build-up--the way the children of the three countries involved were taught to hate the others and we see the reality of the soldiers losing their buddies to the enemy.  And yet, through the magic of Christmas, for a brief moment, the hatred stopped and love prevailed.  If the event had not actually happened the film probably would have been dismissed as totatally unrealistic.  The fact that it did happen, can make us hope that some day the moments of dropping down our weapons will last longer than one day.The writer/director does the story justice.

The plot development leads much to be desired as scenes switch around quickly from British, French and German scenes.  Quite confusing and could have been better done.  The British and German characters get a little background development, but the French character is just thrown at us already in the trenches!  Once we get past this bumpy bit the movie picks up somewhat.  The initial combat scene is confused and not well presented however. The French captain is shown leading his men over the top and then they just appear inside the German trenches along with the Scots!  It makes for some chaotic and unclear sequences which perhaps the producers wanted to show, but makes for confused viewing.  Perhaps there was bad editing here.The Scottish regiment portrayed are the Royal Scots Fusiliers from Glascow and Ayrshire, today known as the Royal Highland Fusiliers.  They were a Lowland regiment, and thus did not wear kilts, but they did wear the glengerry cap and badge as shown in the film. The pipers shown did often pipe their comrades over the top, and many were lost that way.  Some of the tunes played here are not traditional scots pipe tunes and seem adapted for the film.  Certainly the pipes can play Christmas tunes, but it is considerably out of their range.  The arrogant major of the Scots seems to be English, which plays for the usual good Scots, bad English bit so often seen in Cinema these days and made popular by Mel Gibson films.The uniforms for the French and German units are accurate for the most part.  Yes, the French did wear red and blue to begin with because like everyone else they thought the war would be glorious and quick.  The movie is based on some isolated events that may have occured on Christmas eve, 1914.  Certainly what is shown here is not likley to have happened in quite so dramatic a fashion.  It did not occur along the entire Western Front for sure.  Taken for what it is, the film suffers from being a bit sentimental, but it does a decent job showing the feeling of the time and place.  The plot does suffer from being a bit confused at times.  Characters pop out of no where at times.  We are not given a clear indication of the French soldier going behind the German lines in disquise for example.  He simply shows up in the end being shot by the Scots by mistake.  Things like this detract somewhat, but over all its not a bad film.  Anti-war types will like it for sure.  World War One buffs will enjoy its evocation of trench life.

The cinematography is excellent, the acting is very good, the sets are quite nice, and the story, while it may not hue to the perfection that some reviewers would appreciate, is quite moving.It's no surprise that the enlisted man would rather swap candy than kill his fellow man across the lines, but it's quite remarkable that the officers would go along with it.

It's a Christmas movie that gets to the true meaning of the holiday while avoiding all the annoying, hollow cliches about the ""Christmas spirit"" that flood the market every holiday season (in corny TV shows and movies like The Santa Clause.)It is also a war movie that asks the right questions about war without demonizing or blaming any particular worldview.  Some of the best war films challenge the viewer - Platoon comes to mind - but, unfortunately, leave their audience depressed and in despair.  As hellish as war is, as much evil as men commit against each other, sometimes mankind's best characteristics are revealed in battle.  Joyeux Noel celebrates what's best in mankind without being trite, sappy or silly.The religious messages are impossible to avoid.  The director, Christian Carion, superbly demonstrated, through the characters, Father Palmer and the Bishop, the contrast between the loving, caring, humble service Christ demonstrated and the rigid, dogmatic, political and sometimes hateful lives of the members of the religious establishment.  (Sadly, the Bishop's words were taken from an actual sermon given at Westminster Abbey during World War I.)As a work of art, Joyeux Noel is top-notch.  The acting is superb, the sets and costumes are well-done and the soundtrack is beautiful.  It is moving and funny, happy and sad, captivating but moderately paced, all at the appropriate spots.

In JOYEUX NOEL, we get the sentiment of the holiday season and we also see the grit and tragedy of war.The film is based on a true story set in 1914. The war was just beginning and the outcome was yet to be determined. The Germans seemed to be gaining the upper hand, but the Allies were determined. When the story begins, three children: one French, a second German, and the third British give reasons why the war is just, all based on false propaganda, then we are thrust into the war itself in a raging battle at a small farm in France where we meet three regiments: one French, another Scottish, and the other German. The French troops are led by Lieutenant Audebert (Guilluame Canet), a husband and new father who had to leave for battle without knowing whether his wife was safe or whether the child was a boy or girl. Audebert is capable but fails in the eyes of his father, a career militarist. German actor Daniel Bruhl plays Horstmayer, the leader of the Germans who seems to have a strong defensive edge which we learn is due to his being Jewish and being married to a French woman. He has a conflictual relationship with a member of his militia, opera singer turned soldier Nikolaus Sprink (Benno Furmann). The Scottish troops prove to be the most interesting of the groups. Gary Lewis plays Palmer, an Anglican priest who tries as best as he can to serve his troops but cannot shake his dedication to the Gospel which contradicts the war.As the war rages, Christmas arrives. After each group hears Christmas music, a one day cease fore is observed. The dead are buried, the three sides worship, and a human bond develops. Yet there are repercussions for their actions, which are viewed as fraternization and insubordination by leaders.The film works well, which is an accomplishment. It could easily veer into the unbelievable but the reality of war remains throughout the story. This is due to both its tight plot and the abilities of each actor to work as an ensemble. It reminds us of what Christmas is supposed to be about, both by highlighting the spiritual message of the birth of Christ and contrasting it with the reality of war.",4,A Moving Film Based On A True Story,1187740800,"08 22, 2007",2007,2242,"['Christmas', 'almost', 'always', 'perfect', 'setting', 'sentimental', 'story', 'World', 'War', 'not', 'JOYEUX', 'NOEL', 'get', 'sentiment', 'holiday', 'season', 'also', 'see', 'grit', 'tragedy', 'war.The', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'set', '1914', 'war', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'outcome', 'was', 'yet', 'be', 'determined', 'Germans', 'seemed', 'be', 'gaining', 'upper', 'hand', 'Allies', 'were', 'determined', 'When', 'story', 'three', 'children', 'one', 'French', 'second', 'German', 'third', 'British', 'give', 'reasons', 'why', 'war', 'just', 'based', 'false', 'propaganda', 'then', 'are', 'thrust', 'war', 'raging', 'battle', 'small', 'farm', 'France', 'where', 'meet', 'three', 'regiments', 'one', 'French', 'Scottish', 'other', 'German', 'French', 'troops', 'are', 'led', 'Lieutenant', 'Audebert', 'Guilluame', 'Canet', 'husband', 'new', 'father', 'who', 'had', 'leave', 'battle', 'knowing', 'wife', 'was', 'safe', 'child', 'was', 'boy', 'girl', 'Audebert', 'capable', 'eyes', 'father', 'career', 'militarist', 'German', 'actor', 'Daniel', 'Bruhl', 'Horstmayer', 'leader', 'Germans', 'who', 'have', 'strong', 'defensive', 'edge', 'learn', 'due', 'being', 'Jewish', 'being', 'married', 'French', 'woman', 'conflictual', 'relationship', 'member', 'militia', 'opera', 'singer', 'turned', 'soldier', 'Nikolaus', 'Sprink', 'Benno', 'Furmann', 'Scottish', 'troops', 'prove', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'groups', 'Gary', 'Lewis', 'Palmer', 'Anglican', 'priest', 'who', 'as', 'best', 'can', 'serve', 'troops', 'can', 'not', 'shake', 'dedication', 'Gospel', 'war.As', 'war', 'rages', 'Christmas', 'group', 'Christmas', 'music', 'one', 'day', 'cease', 'fore', 'observed', 'dead', 'are', 'buried', 'three', 'sides', 'worship', 'human', 'bond', 'develops', 'are', 'repercussions', 'actions', 'are', 'viewed', 'fraternization', 'insubordination', 'leaders.The', 'film', 'well', 'accomplishment', 'could', 'easily', 'veer', 'unbelievable', 'reality', 'war', 'story', 'due', 'tight', 'plot', 'abilities', 'actor', 'work', 'ensemble', 'what', 'Christmas', 'supposed', 'be', 'about', 'highlighting', 'spiritual', 'message', 'birth', 'Christ', 'contrasting', 'reality', 'war']",N/A
1019304,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000I6BJ56,Trevor Willsmer,"[13, 27]","Charles Dickens knew the importance of establishing horror if you want to show moments of peace or redemption that have real emotional impact. After all, he began A Christmas Carol by emphasising Jacob Marley's death because, without that knowledge, `nothing wonderful can come of this tale.' Sadly, Christian Carrion's Joyeux Noel/Merry Christmas seems oblivious to that lesson, and so without anything tangible in the way of the horrors of war or the psychologically draining nature of trench warfare by way of contrast, there's no sense of relief or wonder to the brief respite offered by the spontaneous 1914 Christmas Truce on the Western Front. As a result, the film carries no real weight. What's worse is just how horrifically bland it all is.At its best it's well-intentioned pap, a woefully inaccurate retelling that gets practically nothing right, historically or artistically. The scant regard it has for history is bad enough when there are so many powerful true incidents from that period to draw on, but the sheer overpowering wrongness of many of the inventions and the complete lack of any emotional involvement with the barely drawn stereotypes is equally deadly. If you're going to invent, at least invent something better! Perhaps it's the preponderance of production companies involved in this Franco-German-Anglo-Romanian co-production (more than a dozen companies and tax shelter funds are credited) that left it so bland and lifeless - certainly there's a feeling that this is not the film anyone wanted to make, merely the one that everybody could more or less agree onMost of the performances are weak to invisible, with Gary Lewis failing miserably to provide anything but an actor's extreme discomfort in a role that's meant to be the heart, soul and conscience of the film while Benno Furrman substitutes a look of stoic indigestion for characterisation as Diane Kruger's Danish opera singer in the trenches (no, seriously) mimes her way through the classics. Only Daniel Bruhle makes much of an impression out of his underwritten role, although even he is outshone by a blink-and-you-ll-miss-it cameo from Michel Serrault and Suzanne Flon that briefly wakes up the film.Carrion's previous film, Une Hirondelle a Fait le Printemps/The Girl From Paris, was quite superb, for the most part avoiding clich&eacute; or whimsy and creating believably flawed characters, which makes his flat handling here seem all the worse.

1019305,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000I6BJ56,Tsuyoshi,"[122, 127]","On Christmas Eve in 1914, the first year of World War I, there was an unauthorized truce between the German and the British/French armies. Both sides first agreed to bury the dead, and a mass was held during this brief time. Some soldiers even enjoyed playing football in no man's land.`Joyeux Nol' is inspired by a real-life event that really happened on Christmas Eve at the several front lines during the First World War, and presents the material in a pretty orthodox way, employing the well-handled multi-plot device, in which we will witness the joys and the pains of each character: Guillaume Canet as French lieutenant, Daniel Br&uuml;hl as German officer, and Gary Lewis as Scottish military chaplain. The cast playing the soldiers are unanimously good, but it is Gary Lewes as tormented military chaplain who is most impressive among them.'Joyeux Nol' also has a sub-plot about a beautiful soprano singer played by Diane Kruger and tenor singer (and her husband) by Benno F&uuml;rmann. I don't know to what extent the film generalized these historical events it shows, but I think their love story looks less effective before the more realistic episodes about the solider in trench. Still these songs are beautiful, and so is Diane Kruger (whose voice is dubbed by soprano singer Natalie Dessay), showing the power of the music which is timeless and universal.But to some viewers (including me), smaller things would remain more strongly in their mind. A stray cat found in trench is given different names by the German and the French soldiers. There is a good-natured French soldier Ponchel, who sneaks out of the trench every night to meet his family living behind the enemy line. There are moments when the film wears its heart on its sleeve, but it is most touching when it chooses not to be so, showing the details of the life under the extreme circumstances.In spite of its wave of sentimentality, `Joyeux Nol' does not forget the reality surrounding the soldiers. It surely has some ""feel-good"" moments that are often seen in the films about Christmas, but it is also about the humans on the battlefield, and you will realize it when you know the fate awaiting them. After all, it was still 1914, and most people must have thought the war would be over soon while we know it finally ended in 1918. The film has a clear, life-affirming message bolstered by moving songs, but the film may look slightly poignant when you imagine how many of them could have survived the war. `Joyeux Nol' is an inspirational French film with several touching songs, a bit of sadness, and hope, too.",4,Merry Christmas in No Man's Land: Inspired by an Episode in World War I,1159401600,"09 28, 2006",2006,2596,"['Christmas', 'Eve', '1914', 'first', 'year', 'World', 'War', 'was', 'unauthorized', 'truce', 'German', 'British/French', 'armies', 'sides', 'first', 'agreed', 'bury', 'dead', 'mass', 'was', 'held', 'brief', 'time', 'soldiers', 'even', 'enjoyed', 'playing', 'football', 'man', 'land.', 'Joyeux', 'Nol', 'inspired', 'real-life', 'event', 'really', 'happened', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'several', 'front', 'lines', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'material', 'pretty', 'orthodox', 'way', 'employing', 'well-handled', 'multi-plot', 'device', 'will', 'witness', 'joys', 'pains', 'character', 'Guillaume', 'Canet', 'French', 'lieutenant', 'Daniel', 'Br', 'uuml', 'German', 'officer', 'Gary', 'Lewis', 'Scottish', 'military', 'chaplain', 'cast', 'playing', 'soldiers', 'are', 'unanimously', 'good', 'Gary', 'Lewes', 'tormented', 'military', 'chaplain', 'who', 'most', 'impressive', 'Nol', 'also', 'sub-plot', 'beautiful', 'soprano', 'singer', 'played', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'tenor', 'singer', 'husband', 'Benno', 'F', 'uuml', 'rmann', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'extent', 'film', 'generalized', 'historical', 'events', 'think', 'love', 'story', 'less', 'effective', 'more', 'realistic', 'episodes', 'solider', 'trench', 'Still', 'songs', 'are', 'beautiful', 'so', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'voice', 'dubbed', 'soprano', 'singer', 'Natalie', 'Dessay', 'showing', 'power', 'music', 'timeless', 'universal.But', 'viewers', 'including', 'smaller', 'things', 'would', 'remain', 'more', 'strongly', 'mind', 'stray', 'cat', 'found', 'trench', 'given', 'different', 'names', 'German', 'French', 'soldiers', 'good-natured', 'French', 'soldier', 'Ponchel', 'who', 'trench', 'night', 'meet', 'family', 'living', 'enemy', 'line', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'film', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'most', 'touching', 'when', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'showing', 'details', 'life', 'extreme', 'circumstances.In', 'spite', 'wave', 'sentimentality', 'Joyeux', 'Nol', 'not', 'forget', 'reality', 'surrounding', 'soldiers', 'surely', 'feel-good', 'moments', 'are', 'often', 'seen', 'films', 'Christmas', 'also', 'humans', 'battlefield', 'will', 'realize', 'when', 'know', 'fate', 'awaiting', 'was', 'still', '1914', 'most', 'people', 'must', 'have', 'thought', 'war', 'would', 'be', 'soon', 'know', 'finally', 'ended', '1918', 'film', 'clear', 'life-affirming', 'message', 'bolstered', 'moving', 'songs', 'film', 'may', 'look', 'slightly', 'poignant', 'when', 'imagine', 'how', 'many', 'could', 'have', 'survived', 'war', 'Joyeux', 'Nol', 'inspirational', 'French', 'film', 'several', 'touching', 'songs', 'bit', 'sadness', 'hope', 'too']",N/A
1019306,A3AW8XP45YVIIZ,B000I6BJ56,Utah Blaine,"[2, 2]","I was fortunate to watch this uniquely outstanding movie on Christmas Day, 2007.  The other positive Amazon reviews of this film do not do begin to do it justice.  I would give this film 6 stars if I could.  This complex, nuanced story of the 1914 Christmas eve truce on the Western front describes the situation on the Western front from French, Scottish, and German perspectives.  The main characters in this film are a Scottish priest, a young French officer, and young German (Jewish) officer, and a two German opera singers (one an enlisted soldier, the other his wife).  Through their eyes we see a mix of sadness, confusion, sense of duty, and responsibility.  On Christmas Eve, 1914, the Germans put Christmas Trees along the top of their trenches.  What follows is an outpouring of camaraderies and friendship that transcends uniforms.  This is not a traditional war film (there is very little `action'), nor is it a traditional anti-war film that shows the plight of maimed soldiers and broken families.  This is a film that will make you stand back and question why the participants chose to fight in the first place.It has always been my belief that for the average soldier in WWI, there was no point to fight.  That is, there was no reason for the man in the trenches (on ANY side) to participate in the fighting.  The issues of the war really didn't concern them.  No matter who won, their lives weren't going to change much.  The only outcome of the war was that many of these average men would be maimed and killed.  The primary (but certainly not only) theme of this film is, in my opinion, the folly of unquestioning patriotism and blind obedience.  Some of the other reviewers (and comments) have tried to tie this message into a larger anti-war theme (and an anti-Iraq War or GWOT theme).  Whether these are analogous or not, I don't know.  Watch the film and decide for yourself!  All sides try to demonize the enemy in war and say `We Are Right' and `This is only a defensive war brought on by our enemies'.  This film presents the view that OUR side (whatever side that may be) may not have `Right' on their side.  When we as a democratic society go to war, we have to be damn sure that we understand the reasons and consequences.Bottom line is that this is a great film.  There are so many little things about this film that make it outstanding.  Even if you don't want to spend the $20 to buy it, get it as a rental from Netflix.  It will definitely be time well spent.",5,6 stars - a subtle and thought-provoking film that people will be watching 100 years from now,1198540800,"12 25, 2007",2007,2494,"['was', 'fortunate', 'watch', 'uniquely', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'Christmas', 'Day', '2007', 'other', 'positive', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'begin', 'do', 'justice', 'would', 'give', 'film', '6', 'stars', 'could', 'complex', 'nuanced', 'story', '1914', 'Christmas', 'eve', 'truce', 'Western', 'front', 'situation', 'Western', 'front', 'French', 'Scottish', 'German', 'perspectives', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'Scottish', 'priest', 'young', 'French', 'officer', 'young', 'German', 'Jewish', 'officer', 'two', 'German', 'opera', 'singers', 'one', 'enlisted', 'soldier', 'other', 'wife', 'eyes', 'see', 'mix', 'sadness', 'confusion', 'sense', 'duty', 'responsibility', 'Christmas', 'Eve', '1914', 'Germans', 'put', 'Christmas', 'Trees', 'top', 'trenches', 'What', 'outpouring', 'camaraderies', 'friendship', 'uniforms', 'not', 'traditional', 'war', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'traditional', 'anti-war', 'film', 'plight', 'maimed', 'soldiers', 'broken', 'families', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'stand', 'back', 'question', 'why', 'participants', 'chose', 'fight', 'first', 'place.It', 'always', 'been', 'belief', 'average', 'soldier', 'WWI', 'was', 'point', 'fight', 'was', 'reason', 'man', 'trenches', 'ANY', 'side', 'participate', 'fighting', 'issues', 'war', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'concern', 'matter', 'who', 'won', 'lives', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'change', 'much', 'only', 'outcome', 'war', 'was', 'many', 'average', 'men', 'would', 'be', 'maimed', 'killed', 'primary', 'certainly', 'not', 'only', 'theme', 'film', 'opinion', 'folly', 'unquestioning', 'patriotism', 'blind', 'obedience', 'other', 'reviewers', 'comments', 'have', 'tried', 'tie', 'message', 'larger', 'anti-war', 'theme', 'anti-Iraq', 'War', 'GWOT', 'theme', 'are', 'analogous', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Watch', 'film', 'decide', 'sides', 'try', 'demonize', 'enemy', 'war', 'say', 'Are', 'Right', 'only', 'defensive', 'war', 'brought', 'enemies', 'film', 'view', 'OUR', 'side', 'side', 'may', 'be', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'Right', 'side', 'When', 'democratic', 'society', 'go', 'war', 'have', 'be', 'damn', 'sure', 'understand', 'reasons', 'consequences.Bottom', 'line', 'great', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'little', 'things', 'film', 'make', 'outstanding', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spend', '20', 'buy', 'get', 'rental', 'Netflix', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'time', 'well', 'spent']",N/A

It is impossible to kill a man with whom you have shared drinks and stories and grown to like.Wonderful music and singing as those who have suffered and fought each other in the trenches slowly gather to mark Christmas Eve by drinking and talking with each other, swapping addresses, singing Christmas carols common to all three nations (Germany, France and Scotland), burying frozen corpses and playing soccer together.Not perfectly historically accurate but very close to an actual incident, A vivid illustration of the foolishness of war. While some have laid the blame at the feet of the soldiers who fight the battles, it is clear that the primary blame lays with those who order others to go to war while safely enjoying the better of things far from the trenches.The script is superb, the cast is uniformly excellent, the sets and cinematography are creatively moody, and the musical score by Philippe Rombi is one of the finest in years: the ending song 'I'm Dreaming of Home' deserves to become a standard.

1019308,A1CETGW1Q1IYYU,B000I6BJ56,"Virginia C. Hughes ""VC Hughes""","[0, 0]","This is a story of Three officers, a Scottish Priest, a German artist, and a Scottish soldier who found themselves on the front lines in 1914 after Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated igniting the first world war. The three officers represented three countries: England (Scot), Germany, and France. It is worth mentioning the German officer was Jewish and made it known he did not favor or want an artist in his ranks; it would have been more poignant if the artist was Adolf himself, but the point got across.It is Christmas Eve 1914 in frigid France and the Germans are facing the Scots and the French. Christmas trees had been delivered to the front lines as well as songs of the season by the german artist and his lady companion. The three officers decide to call a truce for the night and coming days. The french exchanged wine and chocolates with german counterparts as they talked about visiting one another after the war. The Jewish German officer was especially kind to his counterparts. The next morning they engaged in football and other games. When letters were interceded by top command the truce was over and many soldiers were punished, including the Scot priest who was denigrated by his superior and the King of England as he is begrudgingly sent back to his parish in Scotland. When the high priest told the strayed soldiers to kill the Germans, one has to remember the church was still under the Kings reign in England. The Scotish priest was following Christ's teachings when compelled to give a sermon on Christmas Eve preaching divine peace.The acting was superb in this film and landscape authentic as life in the trenches was displayed. It was quite unbelievable how such a truce and care for the dead (as they were appropriately buried the same day Christ was born)arose on that december night back in 1914; it was clear that peace superceded war and hatred for that short period as the Scottish Priest put it, ""they came to the sermon like a fire in winter"", speaking of the Xmas eve sermon he gave. Peace is what they wanted, all of them.The film is not without poignant symbolisms. One of the last scenes the audience will observe is a cattle car headed off to East Prussia containing the Jewish German Officers platoon. As the train goes slowly into the distance you can hear solemn singing coming from inside the train. An excellent film to experience the lack on interest in war, lack of passion in killing the so called enemy and instead moving toward warmth in brotherhood.",5,The Great War Hiatus,1325376000,"01 1, 2012",2012,2507,"['story', 'Three', 'officers', 'Scottish', 'Priest', 'German', 'artist', 'Scottish', 'soldier', 'who', 'found', 'front', 'lines', '1914', 'Archduke', 'Ferdinand', 'was', 'assassinated', 'igniting', 'first', 'world', 'war', 'three', 'officers', 'represented', 'three', 'countries', 'England', 'Scot', 'Germany', 'France', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'German', 'officer', 'was', 'Jewish', 'made', 'known', 'did', 'not', 'favor', 'want', 'artist', 'ranks', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'poignant', 'artist', 'was', 'Adolf', 'point', 'got', 'across.It', 'Christmas', 'Eve', '1914', 'frigid', 'France', 'Germans', 'are', 'facing', 'Scots', 'French', 'Christmas', 'trees', 'had', 'been', 'delivered', 'front', 'lines', 'as', 'well', 'songs', 'season', 'german', 'artist', 'lady', 'companion', 'three', 'officers', 'decide', 'call', 'truce', 'night', 'coming', 'days', 'french', 'exchanged', 'wine', 'chocolates', 'german', 'counterparts', 'talked', 'visiting', 'one', 'war', 'Jewish', 'German', 'officer', 'was', 'especially', 'kind', 'counterparts', 'next', 'morning', 'engaged', 'football', 'other', 'games', 'When', 'letters', 'were', 'interceded', 'top', 'command', 'truce', 'was', 'many', 'soldiers', 'were', 'punished', 'including', 'Scot', 'priest', 'who', 'was', 'denigrated', 'superior', 'King', 'England', 'begrudgingly', 'sent', 'back', 'parish', 'Scotland', 'When', 'high', 'priest', 'told', 'strayed', 'soldiers', 'kill', 'Germans', 'remember', 'church', 'was', 'still', 'Kings', 'reign', 'England', 'Scotish', 'priest', 'was', 'following', 'Christ', 'teachings', 'when', 'compelled', 'give', 'sermon', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'preaching', 'divine', 'peace.The', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'film', 'landscape', 'authentic', 'life', 'trenches', 'was', 'displayed', 'was', 'quite', 'unbelievable', 'how', 'such', 'truce', 'care', 'dead', 'were', 'appropriately', 'buried', 'same', 'day', 'Christ', 'was', 'born', 'arose', 'december', 'night', 'back', '1914', 'was', 'clear', 'peace', 'superceded', 'war', 'hatred', 'short', 'period', 'Scottish', 'Priest', 'put', 'came', 'sermon', 'fire', 'winter', 'speaking', 'Xmas', 'eve', 'sermon', 'gave', 'Peace', 'what', 'wanted', 'them.The', 'film', 'not', 'poignant', 'symbolisms', 'One', 'last', 'scenes', 'audience', 'will', 'observe', 'cattle', 'car', 'headed', 'off', 'East', 'Prussia', 'containing', 'Jewish', 'German', 'Officers', 'platoon', 'train', 'slowly', 'distance', 'can', 'hear', 'solemn', 'singing', 'coming', 'train', 'excellent', 'film', 'experience', 'lack', 'interest', 'war', 'lack', 'passion', 'killing', 'so', 'called', 'enemy', 'instead', 'moving', 'warmth', 'brotherhood']",N/A

Was it Patton who said ""The object of war is not to die for your country, but to help the other poor boob die for his!"".",5,The end answers why,1374969600,"07 28, 2013",2013,830,"['end', 'movie', 'might', 'appear', 'confusing', 'first', 'participants', 'truce', 'were', 'subjected', 'same', 'beat', 'down', 'superior', 'officers', 'Scottish', 'French', 'German', 'received', 'exactly', 'same', 'treatment', 'were', 'shuffled', 'off', 'be', 'totally', 'ignored', 'specifically', 'NOT', 'talked', 'otherwise', 'heard', 'again.Why', 'committed', 'ultimate', 'cardinal', 'sin', 'total', 'war', 'recognizing', 'enemy', 'human', 'same', 'How', 'can', 'average', 'soldier', 'be', 'expected', 'willingly', 'participate', 'utter', 'slaughter', 'enemy', 'enemy', 'friend', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'allowed', 'happen', 'generals', 'politicians', 'ca', ""n't"", 'allow', 'enemy', 'HAS', 'be', 'enemy', 'Was', 'Patton', 'who', 'said', 'object', 'war', 'not', 'die', 'country', 'help', 'other', 'poor', 'boob', 'die']",N/A

The beautiful music was an added bonus. I also enjoyed how effectively the movie portrayed the disconnect between those making the decisions about war and those who are doing the actual fighting. Warning: grab some tissues before the movie starts.,5,Highly recommend,1386720000,"12 11, 2013",2013,393,"['beautiful', 'story', 'truth', 'shared', 'humanity', 'greater', 'things', 'divide', 'Beautifully', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'beautiful', 'music', 'was', 'added', 'bonus', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'effectively', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'disconnect', 'making', 'decisions', 'war', 'who', 'are', 'doing', 'actual', 'fighting', 'Warning', 'grab', 'tissues', 'movie']",N/A

'The Great War' that not even The History Channel touches. Fortunately I found this in the rental bin at the store and figured I would give it a try.A warning to those looking for an action/war flick..this is not it. This a heavy drama with a powerful message. There is a battle scene at the begining of the movie but it feels to me that it was obligatory and thrown in just because of the setting of the movie. It does nothing to illustrate the ablolute horror of trench warfare during this seemingly forgotten war.There are scenes in this movie that truly touch the heart. Christmas day after the Christmas Eve gathering the German officer goes out to meet a Scottish officer on the battlefield who is ordering a Scottish soldier back to the trench who is on the battlefield without authorization digging a grave for his brother. The German officer has to order his troops back into the trench as they try to follow him out. They didn't want to fight.Many touching scenes. Great cinematography. Excellent music, especially if you like bagpipes. Uniforms and weaponry are all right on. This Sony DVD release is incredible at handling the subtitles. There is English, French and German spoken throughout and the English subtitles come up only when English is not spoken, a very easy movie to watch.",5,Excellent WW I Movie,1171065600,"02 10, 2007",2007,1404,"['had', 'just', 'bought', 'watched', 'Flyboys', 'Flyboys', 'was', 'not', 'greatest', 'left', 'mood', 'WWI', 'Great', 'War', 'not', 'even', 'History', 'Channel', 'touches', 'Fortunately', 'found', 'rental', 'bin', 'store', 'figured', 'would', 'give', 'try.A', 'warning', 'looking', 'action/war', 'flick..this', 'not', 'heavy', 'drama', 'powerful', 'message', 'battle', 'scene', 'begining', 'movie', 'was', 'obligatory', 'thrown', 'just', 'setting', 'movie', 'nothing', 'illustrate', 'ablolute', 'horror', 'trench', 'warfare', 'seemingly', 'forgotten', 'are', 'scenes', 'movie', 'truly', 'touch', 'heart', 'Christmas', 'day', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'gathering', 'German', 'officer', 'out', 'meet', 'Scottish', 'officer', 'battlefield', 'who', 'ordering', 'Scottish', 'soldier', 'back', 'trench', 'who', 'battlefield', 'authorization', 'digging', 'grave', 'brother', 'German', 'officer', 'order', 'troops', 'back', 'trench', 'try', 'follow', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'fight.Many', 'touching', 'scenes', 'Great', 'cinematography', 'Excellent', 'music', 'especially', 'like', 'bagpipes', 'Uniforms', 'weaponry', 'are', 'right', 'Sony', 'DVD', 'release', 'incredible', 'handling', 'subtitles', 'English', 'French', 'German', 'spoken', 'English', 'subtitles', 'come', 'up', 'only', 'when', 'English', 'not', 'spoken', 'very', 'easy', 'movie', 'watch']",N/A
