1337766,A3K8JS5ZZL3GGF,B003E51VUQ,Amazon Customer,"[1, 7]","From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaThe Clannad visual novel is divided into two segments, or story arcs--School Life and After Story--which serve as different phases in the overall story. At the beginning of the game, only the School Life arc is available to play, but once the player has completed the scenarios available in School Life, After Story is made accessible. This is through the collection of eight lights, or orbs, which can be obtained after a character's scenario is completed; one of the lights will disappear while still in School Life, but will reappear in After Story.[1]School Life contains the final year of high school of the main protagonist, Tomoya Okazaki, in which he meets all of the characters in the game, though the focus is kept on the five heroines in the story, including the main heroine Nagisa Furukawa. After Story is mainly a continuation of Nagisa's story, and is set immediately after School Life when Nagisa and Tomoya are now living their lives as a couple, and extends into the next ten years.[1] Characters from School Life do appear, but play minor roles compared to their roles in that arc. In order to view the true ending of Clannad, all thirteen lights must be obtained. Originally, the lights were meant to be items that players could use in the game, but since this increased the game's difficulty, and detracted from the storyline, the function of the lights was changed to be simpler and less intrusive.[2]Clannad's gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent simply reading the text that appears on the game screen which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. An important aspect of Clannad (as in nearly every visual novel) are the ""decision points"" which appear every so often which give the player the chance to choose from a limited number of options. The time between these decision points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. The game pauses at such moments and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story, and there are thirteen possible endings. Each plot line can be achieved through multiple replays.[1]Clannad is Key's second longest work, as reported by Yto Tonokawa where he stated that Clannad is about 4000 words fewer than Key's 2008 game Little Busters! Ecstasy.[3] While both of Key's first two previous works, Kanon and Air, had been released first as adult games and then censored for the younger market, Key's third work Clannad was released for all ages and does not contain risqu&eacute; situations or barely any fan service other than one small scene.[1]",4,Wikipedia,1281398400,"08 10, 2010",2010,2849,"['Wikipedia', 'free', 'encyclopediaThe', 'Clannad', 'visual', 'novel', 'divided', 'two', 'segments', 'story', 'arcs', 'School', 'Life', 'Story', 'serve', 'different', 'phases', 'overall', 'story', 'beginning', 'game', 'only', 'School', 'Life', 'arc', 'available', 'play', 'once', 'player', 'completed', 'scenarios', 'available', 'School', 'Life', 'Story', 'made', 'accessible', 'collection', 'eight', 'lights', 'orbs', 'can', 'be', 'obtained', 'character', 'scenario', 'completed', 'one', 'lights', 'will', 'disappear', 'still', 'School', 'Life', 'will', 'reappear', 'Story', '1', ']', 'School', 'Life', 'final', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'main', 'protagonist', 'Tomoya', 'Okazaki', 'characters', 'game', 'focus', 'kept', 'five', 'heroines', 'story', 'including', 'main', 'heroine', 'Nagisa', 'Furukawa', 'Story', 'mainly', 'continuation', 'Nagisa', 'story', 'set', 'immediately', 'School', 'Life', 'when', 'Nagisa', 'Tomoya', 'are', 'now', 'living', 'lives', 'couple', 'next', 'ten', 'years', '1', ']', 'Characters', 'School', 'Life', 'do', 'appear', 'play', 'minor', 'roles', 'compared', 'roles', 'arc', 'order', 'view', 'true', 'ending', 'Clannad', 'thirteen', 'lights', 'must', 'be', 'obtained', 'Originally', 'lights', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'items', 'players', 'could', 'use', 'game', 'increased', 'game', 'difficulty', 'detracted', 'storyline', 'function', 'lights', 'was', 'changed', 'be', 'simpler', 'less', 'intrusive', '2', ']', 'Clannad', 'gameplay', 'little', 'interaction', 'player', 'most', 'duration', 'game', 'spent', 'simply', 'reading', 'text', 'game', 'screen', 'dialogue', 'various', 'characters', 'inner', 'thoughts', 'protagonist', 'important', 'aspect', 'Clannad', 'nearly', 'visual', 'novel', 'are', 'decision', 'points', 'appear', 'so', 'often', 'give', 'player', 'chance', 'choose', 'limited', 'number', 'options', 'time', 'decision', 'points', 'variable', 'can', 'occur', 'anywhere', 'minute', 'much', 'longer', 'game', 'such', 'moments', 'depending', 'choice', 'player', 'plot', 'will', 'progress', 'specific', 'direction', 'are', 'five', 'main', 'plot', 'lines', 'player', 'will', 'have', 'chance', 'experience', 'one', 'heroines', 'story', 'are', 'thirteen', 'possible', 'endings', 'plot', 'line', 'can', 'be', 'achieved', 'multiple', 'replays', '1', ']', 'Clannad', 'Key', 'second', 'longest', 'work', 'reported', 'Yto', 'Tonokawa', 'where', 'stated', 'Clannad', '4000', 'words', 'fewer', 'Key', '2008', 'game', 'Little', 'Busters', 'Ecstasy', '3', ']', 'Key', 'first', 'two', 'previous', 'works', 'Kanon', 'Air', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'first', 'adult', 'games', 'then', 'censored', 'younger', 'market', 'Key', 'third', 'work', 'Clannad', 'was', 'released', 'ages', 'not', 'contain', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'situations', 'barely', 'fan', 'service', 'other', 'one', 'small', 'scene', '1', ']']",Clannad Complete Collection

1337775,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B003E51VUQ,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[1, 1]","This is a subtle twist on the slice of life anime drama genre.  The series features a high school delinquent Tomoya Okazaki and his friend Sunohara.  The story revolves mainly around Tomoya, while Sunohara is around for comic relief.  The series starts innocently enough, and appears at first glance to be a simple, straightforward high school drama.  It resembles  High School Rumble and Azumanga Daioh at first.  But as the episodes progress, the viewer discovers that not all is as it seems.~ Light spoilers here ~Of course this isn't a creepy, supernatural series, but there are a few moments where something 'out of the ordinary' is introduced.  But we find that many of the characters have pretty sad back stories.  Tomoya came to school on a basketball scholarship, but cannot play anymore due to an injury sustained during a beating by his father.  Another character is actually the representation of a girl in the hospital in a coma.~ End of light spoilers ~The comedy is well portrayed, and it keeps the show fun and helps balance out the sad and touching moments.  In particular I enjoyed Fuko and Tomoya's interactions.  She is always saying ""that's the worst!"" whenever someone asks if they are dating, or related.  They engage in a fierce and funny tongue twister battle (laughed out loud at that part!).  But we still get the feeling that Tomoya cares for her greatly and they have a kind of older brother/ younger sister relationship.  There are also some funny little in-jokes about 'dating sims'.  They are the little cuts that have the 'achievement' bubble pop up (Achievement Complete: Make someone drink juice through their nose! - Congratulations!) or something like that!If you aren't hooked after the first couple of episodes, then perhaps this isn't the series for you.  By episode 6 I was riveted.  I haven't enjoyed very many serious, modern setting anime series lately (shout out to Eden of the East!), so this series was quite a surprise.Of note:  I am watching the original US release version by Sentai (which does not include an English dub), and am very happy with the translation and subtitles.  All of the dry humor comes across.  The Japanese voice acting is superb, especially the female characters, and Fuko in particular.I highly recommend this to adult anime fans.  Some of the younger fans may enjoy this (it is an all ages anime), but a lot of the themes really come across as more adult in nature (such as loss, heartache, redemption, etc.); which is not to say younger fans wouldn't enjoy it... the comedy alone is enough to endear younger audiences.  This show will make you laugh out loud and then cry five minutes later.  Simply a wonderful and heartfelt story.",5,Amazing storytelling ~,1329609600,"02 19, 2012",2012,2707,"['subtle', 'twist', 'slice', 'life', 'anime', 'drama', 'genre', 'series', 'high', 'school', 'delinquent', 'Tomoya', 'Okazaki', 'friend', 'Sunohara', 'story', 'mainly', 'Tomoya', 'Sunohara', 'comic', 'relief', 'series', 'innocently', 'enough', 'first', 'glance', 'be', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'High', 'School', 'Rumble', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', 'first', 'episodes', 'progress', 'viewer', 'discovers', 'not', 'seems.~', 'Light', 'spoilers', 'here', '~Of', 'course', ""n't"", 'creepy', 'supernatural', 'series', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'something', 'ordinary', 'introduced', 'find', 'many', 'characters', 'have', 'pretty', 'sad', 'back', 'stories', 'Tomoya', 'came', 'school', 'basketball', 'scholarship', 'can', 'not', 'play', 'anymore', 'due', 'injury', 'sustained', 'beating', 'father', 'character', 'actually', 'representation', 'girl', 'hospital', 'coma.~', 'End', 'light', 'spoilers', '~The', 'comedy', 'well', 'portrayed', 'show', 'fun', 'balance', 'out', 'sad', 'touching', 'moments', 'particular', 'enjoyed', 'Fuko', 'Tomoya', 'interactions', 'always', 'saying', 'worst', 'whenever', 'someone', 'are', 'dating', 'related', 'engage', 'fierce', 'funny', 'tongue', 'twister', 'battle', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'part', 'still', 'get', 'feeling', 'Tomoya', 'greatly', 'have', 'kind', 'older', 'brother/', 'younger', 'sister', 'relationship', 'are', 'also', 'funny', 'little', 'in-jokes', ""'dating"", 'sims', 'are', 'little', 'cuts', 'have', ""'achievement"", 'bubble', 'pop', 'up', 'Achievement', 'Complete', 'Make', 'someone', 'drink', 'juice', 'nose', 'Congratulations', 'something', 'are', ""n't"", 'hooked', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'then', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'series', 'episode', '6', 'was', 'riveted', 'have', ""n't"", 'enjoyed', 'very', 'many', 'serious', 'modern', 'setting', 'anime', 'series', 'lately', 'shout', 'Eden', 'East', 'so', 'series', 'was', 'quite', 'surprise.Of', 'note', 'am', 'watching', 'original', 'US', 'release', 'version', 'Sentai', 'not', 'include', 'English', 'dub', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'translation', 'subtitles', 'dry', 'humor', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'acting', 'superb', 'especially', 'female', 'characters', 'Fuko', 'particular.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'adult', 'anime', 'fans', 'younger', 'fans', 'may', 'enjoy', 'ages', 'anime', 'lot', 'themes', 'really', 'come', 'more', 'adult', 'nature', 'such', 'loss', 'heartache', 'redemption', 'etc', 'not', 'say', 'younger', 'fans', 'would', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'comedy', 'alone', 'enough', 'endear', 'younger', 'audiences', 'show', 'will', 'make', 'loud', 'then', 'cry', 'five', 'minutes', 'later', 'Simply', 'wonderful', 'heartfelt', 'story']",Clannad Complete Collection

1337780,A3JC0JWNWX2HHU,B003E51VUQ,Daniel Meek,"[0, 0]","This is the first half of the Clannad story.  'After Story' covers the other half.Like AirTV and Kanon this show has a lot of the same themes and ideas, but this series takes a much less fantastical approach to the story telling.  It still has moments of fantasy, but it is more of a 'faith' based inexplicable force through the series that holds the background together rather than being the main event.This first half is much less dramatic than Air or Kanon (don't worry, the 2nd half more than makes up for it), following the carefree and directionless days of Senior highschoolers whose 'plan A' did not work out, and they are desperately searching for some form of validation or direction to move in to gain some meaning to their lives.  Specifically it focuses on Tomoyo whose dreams of being a sports prodigy failed, and he finds some meaning in life in helping Nagisa fulfill her passion of resurrecting the school's drama club.

1337782,A1RHXIZOOR6922,B003E51VUQ,"David Lam ""Dark Shadow""","[0, 1]","Clannad by Kyoto Animation is one of the most beautiful harem anime series ever produced. A harem anime series with mixed genres like comedy, tragedy, suspense, drama, etc. The storyline follows a young male high school delinquent named Okazaki, Tomoya & his interactions between multiple high school girls, particularly one very special girl; Furukawa, Nagisa. As the storyline progresses Tomoya continues to get more involved with the personal lives of these high school girls enduring both triumphs & hardships. The plot of the anime series is quite slow with some dull moments but it holds more of the romantic comedic/tragic material that is expected to arise within the storyline. The pacing of the plot might be slow but it is necessary for the viewer to take advantage of that dull time period to understand the characters & identify what characteristics they all share & hold uniquely. Overall, one of the best romantic comedy or tragedy anime series whose popularity mirrors famous Shakespearean literature.The english voice acting is well performed with the emotions & personalities of the characters portrayed perfectly & precisely.

Key has made things likeKanon: Complete Series Box Set S.A.V.E.andAir TV: The Complete Series S.A.V.E.to name a few. The series revolves around Tomoya Okazaki, a delinquent student with a kind heart and a sharp tongue, and his interactions with a group of girls;Nagisa Furukawa, a shy but kind girl with a weak immune system who wants to revive the Drama Club.Kotomi Ichinose, an eccentric genius who spends more time in the Library than in the presence of other.Tomoyo Sakagami, a transfer student trying to become the Student Council President.Fuuko Ibuki, a first year that carves starfish out of wood for her sister's wedding.Kyou Fujibayashi, the elder of twin sisters that has a very aggressive personality.The theme in Clannad is ""Family"" and anywhere it could be found.

1337787,A3HZ8JLMMGVVPV,B003E51VUQ,Jonathan A. Chang,"[5, 23]","WARNING: SOME SPOILERS!Does anyone remember the movie Usual Suspects? When it first came out, people were so shocked at the ending that it gathered some praise and eventually a cult following. But if you were to go back and watch it again, knowing exactly what was going to happen, you might have found it boring, badly directed -- in fact for most of the movie it was unarguably below average. But the movie succeeded on some level because it was the last 10 minutes that people remembered. I feel same way about Clannad.I hate improperly placed exposition. In the movie Empire, I don't think many film fans would argue with me here that the rant at the end was a cheap way to drum emotion and sympathy. Proper storytelling should show us the thoughts and motivations of its characters through their action; as far as I am concerned, exposition should be the last resort. Yet in anime, it is commonplace for characters to go into episode-long speeches and flashbacks about what drives them (the same tactic you'd generally only find in soap operas). Fans of said pieces will say that I don't understand the meaning behind Clannad, that it's about family, love, and unexpected tragedy. I say they don't understand proper storytelling, and just because every character has some sob story that singularly drives all their actions doesn't mean the story is ""deep"" -- quite the contrary (after all, who in the real world is singularly driven by a Freudian prescription?). But the fans are especially zealous when it comes to this ""sad = deep"" mantra, and we see this across works that apply a similar mode of storytelling: like in Metal Gear Solid 4, where every boss that never shows up again goes into a 20 minute exposition before they die; Naruto, where every character is driven by some bad childhood or bullying, and somehow only the main character is privy to solve those problems; the Fate universe (e.g. Fate/Zero); Bleach, where every minor Arrancar has their sob backstory to justify why they must become stronger; and so forth... And Clannad will be neither first nor last in this regard. Every character arc will develop that character only on account of some sappy backstory, as if this is what defines them wholly, and it is up to our hero, Tomoya, to solve all their problems. And whereas in Bakemonogatari, this is somewhat justified because the main character was a vampire, and in Haruhi because Haruhi is God, Tomoya is presented as a typical disinterested high school student in Clannad, which ironically adds to the unbelievability.What's the first thing that comes to mind when dealing with a title like Clannad? Pretentious. In some obscure Irish reference, Clannad means ""family""; what why did Key choose this name when there are no Irish characters or anything that can be construed to be Irish in the series? Rather, the name is somewhat of a subliminal hint of what's to come. And so is the first few minutes of the first episode. Whenever I see some metaphorical exposition about an alternate world presented as some children's book in vain of Chobits, first I think, who writes these?! Then I roll my eyes. This thing about the girl and a robot isn't deep because it isn't so original. It's been done in countless other anime.I'll break the rest of this review down into aspects of the anime, so as to provide some sort of structure for easier reading:Art -- 3.5/5 (Average). A lot of other people praise the art of Clannad, but I found it to be rather bland, typical of moe anime. There is no more keyframes, detail, and the character design isn't any more unique than any other anime, like ToraDora! or Sket Dance. Haruhi had fleeting moments of CGI that flowed well, and Ano Hana is heads above more detailed than Clannad. I'm not sure what Clannad fans are comparing it to, probably other projects by Kyoto Animation... How generic are big breasted chicks with purple hair?Characters -- 2/5 (Bad). Clannad characters are built from the moe archetypes that any anime fan could identify: the comedic relief character whose only role is getting beat up like Team Rocket from Pokemon (Sunohara); the shy, stuttering girl that's incapable of communicating a single coherent idea (Ryou); the tsundere girl that starts out with a bad attitude and is somehow good at all sports (Kyou);  the mature and cute imouto/sister (Mei); the motherly class rep that want to take care of the main character (Tomoyo); and the silent genius girl that's content with reading books (Kotomi). These are all characters that you would find in any harem romance, especially visual novels games where the player chooses which one he would like to ""date"". And aside from the aforementioned sob stories, these characters remain shells, standing on the sidelines, waiting for the right moment to add to the emotional capacity of the show.The only two characters that matter are Nagisa -- an insecure, low self-esteem, physically weak girl that develops a dependency on the main character (probably every otaku nerd's wet dream); and Tomoya -- presented as a delinquent that often skips school, has gotten into 1 fight that we know of, yet has the capacity to pick a fight with the entire baseball team, that has nothing better to do but to help a bunch of girls out that he does not know, even though he secretly laments his role. He often pranks the other characters, which lead to amusing situations that sometimes cause huge misunderstandings between the other characters -- which is to say our hero Tomoya manufactured most of the drama in this series. (This is the kid that would get bullied and beat up in real life, yet in Clannad-verse, he is the object of all the girls at his school.)Plot (Intro):Every season or two, an anime show would come along with a literal formula for success. It would have a reluctant main character with no particular interests getting pulled into the lives of all the side characters, most of them girls (harem sells). While this might sound okay according to anime logic, reality tells us that he is a loser with no passions of his own, and no backbone to stand up for what he really wants to do. In anime, and perhaps the minds of naive men, he is the archetypical ""nice guy"" that ends up helping every, yet this a virgin fantasy. Such a character when encountered in real life are often most manipulative, and in fact this manipulation doesn't escape animation despite the writer's most earnest efforts.Plot: Fuko Arc -- 2/5 (Annoying). A strange girl with an unlimited supply of carved wooden starfishes must give them out to as many people as she could in order to invite them to her sister's wedding before it's too late. Tomoya, with nothing better to do, decides to help, at first only for his amusement, but he is shoehorned into the role of a ""nice guy"" (by the amateurish scriptwriter, no doubt) and mysteriously accepts his role after an unexplained change of heart. All the girls in the school want to help him out, because... who knows? Maybe high school girls want a bad boy delinquent who happens to be a nice guy fantasy; maybe that's what's ""in"" these days... Problem solved, everyone cries -- cue sad, emotion version of the Dango ending song -- mysterious lights float, 5 minute montage, they cry some more, Tomoya gives, presumably, what should have been an inspiring pep-talk according to the formula, about how it's a happy ending after all. Then the scriptwriter comes out and says, ""See what we did there? Cry now."" Well, no he didn't, but he might as well have...Plot: Kotomi Arc -- 0/5 (Contrived). A silent girl's tragic past is revealed as our hero decides to become her part-time gardener and solve her daddy issues. The other characters help out because... no idea. They weren't really friends or anything at this point. Girl *SPOILER* (but not really) forgives papa because it was revealed that he loved her after all (no... really?), girl stops blaming herself. A 10 minute montage is shown of people across the world passing around a briefcase, by foot and camels, saying in their respective languages, ""Please pass this to my daughter."" With no stones unturned, we have a French herder, Arabian camel-rider and pyramids, Eskimo and igloo, Chinese people, etc. All in bad Japanese accents. No one thought of using post, apparently. And it was supposed to signify how much Kotomi's parents loved her, but it was so incredibly contrived and cheesy that it lost any effectiveness. *END SPOILER* To begin with, this story might have been believable if Kotomi was 8 years old, but she's supposed to be a genius high school student. The character motivations are all so fake that the show becomes frustrating to an audience with any kind of semblance of intelligence (my opinion, of course). Of course, once again, Kotomi cries. Characters cry because of how ""sad"" it is. Cue sad version of Dango ending theme, cheesy montage, and scriptwriter steps out again and breaks the 4th wall, saying, ""Look again. See what we did? When I snap, you cry."" Okay, he still didn't do that, but the brilliance of Clannad is the 4th wall was somehow obliterated without any of the characters on-screen acknowledging it (due to bad, contrived, script). It's just cheap, contrived, manipulative, forced, melodrama...Plot: Nagisa Arc -- 3/5 (Mediocrity). Tomoya helps Nagisa form a theater club, and Nagisa struggles in figuring out what she wants to write about. Nagisa figures it out (remember the pretentious alternate reality shown in the beginning, and some episodes later?). Tomoya does not notice the obvious advances that some of the other girls are making at him, because he is gay -- or at least he freaks out whenever he accidentally touches a girl. Manufactured drama about how 6-7 somewhat attractive high school/middle school girls is head over heels with this clueless guy -- no other guy in the school shall suffice -- and it's so sad (cue music) that Tomoya doesn't make up his mind. Girls cry. After 22 episodes, Tomoya makes his obvious decision (you knew who it was from episode 1, no surprises). They date but as typical high school students, they are embarrassed about holding hands, and being the passive, clueless guy Tomoya is, he doesn't make advances until prompted by other characters. Cue music. Scriptwriter steps out. The end.Plot: Tomoyo Arc -- 4/5 (Surprisingly entertaining). But unfortunately, it's only 1 episode. This is an alternate reality about what would have happened if Tomoya chose Tomoyo instead. And Tomoyo's motivation in this is surprisingly more real than Nagisa. She's a class rep torn between her love for Tomoya and her future. This episode is proof that they could've condensed the entire 24 episode season into maybe 11 episodes, or less, and it would have been vastly superior.Plot Preview (from After Story): Sunohara Arc -- 0/5 (Contrived). *SPOILER* Tomoya trolls his best friend Sunohara by arranging a date for him with Nagisa's mom without his knowledge, all the while convincing Sunohara that she may eventually fall in love with him. Sunohara gets jaded; his sister, Mei, is upset, runs out, Tomoya follows and they scheme to pretend to be in love so that when Sunohara sees this, he will get angry and prove that he cares about Mei. Sunohara sees them, and then resigns to the idea of his pedophile best friend dating his sister, instead leaves. Mei thinks Sunohara doesn't care about her anymore, and came to the miraculous conclusion that all this happened because Sunohara quit baseball (?!). Tomoya then convinces his gang of women that they must take it within themselves to convince the baseball team to let Sunohara back on the team. Not only to they refuse, they talk a lot of trash about Sunohara. How could they?! Cue sad Dango music, Mei cries, Tomoya's eyes darken, he squeezes his fist. It's just too much! Then, just when he was about to lose it, Sunohara jumps out and the two of them fight what must have been about 6 athletic baseball members (and although they were both injured, it insinuates that they didn't lose that fight). *END SPOILER*Note: The previous paragraph is indicative of the type of storytelling in Clannad. If you read it and said WTF? Then we're on the same page. If you read it and thought, ""How sad!"" Then I encourage you to buy this anime right now, and its sequel, the After Story, and everything else ever produced by Key and Kyoto Animation.And don't get me wrong, I've sat through shows like ef - Tales of Melodies with no bad feelings about it, and I must say that if you are looking for some melodrama, that would be less grating. Rather, it's the lack of realism and consistency that makes it hard to suspend disbelief. Realism is quite a hard subject to tackle, because first and foremost it is relative. Watching Goku with the power to destroy entire planets somehow makes sense within the world of DBZ, yet if transplanted to, say, Gundam, would be totally unrealistic (taken by themselves though, they are both more realistic than Clannad). When I say Clannad is unrealistic, I don't mean absolute realism, but realism within the context of the story; there is an inconsistency with the idea that Clannad is based around an average high school populated with high school students -- but none of the characters act like real high school students, think like or have motivations of real people. The situations are sometimes so contrived that I sometimes found myself yelling in my head at the screen, ""What the hell? Why did you just do that?"" It was as if Key needed certain conditions to script the next ""sad"" scene, but when the actions of the main characters are so jarring, it kicks the audience out of immersion from the show. Instead of watching the characters, I feel more like watching a script-writer direct the characters, and that completely destroys whatever sad moment this show might have had. I almost wouldn't have been surprised if the writers had held a meeting and said, ""Alright guys. We need a sob back story for each character to make them seem conflicted. Everyone pick a name out of the hat, and tomorrow afternoon we discuss how to get from point A to B.""As far as I'm concerned, if you skip all the side character arcs, and just watch the Nagisa stuff, Ep. 1 to about 3, Ep. 15-22, then After Story about Ep. 10-19 or so, this series would be much more tolerable, and might even make it to ""Mediocre"" status.Music -- 2/5 (Annoying). Mostly variations of the ending themes. The timing of the soundtrack might be well done... maybe too well done that it becomes obvious when they want you to cry, and when they want you to laugh.Drama -- 1/5 (Plain horrible). I didn't cry. It was cheesier than Wisconsin. I laughed in the scenes where I were ""supposed to"" cry.Comedy -- 3.5/5 (Decent). Some amusing moments here and there. Would have been fine if they stuck to it, but Clannad has somewhat bipolar disorder -- it couldn't decide if it wanted to be a comedy or tragedy. In the end, both sides suffered.Romance -- 2/5 (Bad). ToraDora! and Suzuka were more effective. ef - Tales series dealt with memory better than the Fuko arc.Overall -- 2/5 (Not recommended). Stream some of it online to see if you like this sort of thing first. I think CrunchyRoll might have it.",2,"Move along, nothing to see here...",1351036800,"10 24, 2012",2012,15250,"['WARNING', 'SOME', 'SPOILERS', 'Does', 'anyone', 'remember', 'movie', 'Usual',

I wasn't sure when I first saw it but it quickly grew on me as one of my favorites. From making you roll around laughing to inducing tears, this series is full of all kinds of emotional twists. Upon first glimpse, I thought it was just another Anime involving high school students, but the more I watched, the more I realized how much of a masterpiece this was. Definitely check it out.UPDATE: I just purchased the blu-ray Clannad Collection and as usual with this series, I'm very pleased. It has both English and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 with this set. The audio listed on the product description with Amazon shows it as Japanese Audio and doesn't list English, but if you examine the screenshots of the back of the case, in the lower left hand part of it shows both English and Japanese. I will thoroughly enjoy watching this series again in the higher resolution and remain here hoping Sentai Filmworks re-releases After Story for blu-ray sometime soon.Also, another thing about the blu-ray series is the case is much better than the one used for the DVD set. The blu-ray case has all 3 discs seperate instead of stacking each disc on one spindle. Much easier and safer for the disc with the blu-ray collection.",5,Anime that can induce many emotions.

Everything about Clannad is incredible. The art is beautiful, especially in Blu-ray. The music is enchanting, there are lots of great characters, and the story is incomperable. Every emotion can be felt when watching Clannad. It so wonderful that its hard to explain it to someone. You really just need to watch it to understand. I was so emotionally touched by this series. The sequel, Clannad After Story, is even better. The only other anime that compares is Kanon.If you like anime get Clannad.

1337791,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B003E51VUQ,maskedgamer,"[0, 0]","But I didn't think it was a bad anime at all. On the first Volume I felt about 6 of the episodes dragged on too long because they were about the same story. It was a weird switch because the first few episodes focus on the main girl, and then all of a sudden she takes a back seat.I've never really been a fan of drama/comedy animies like this. This reminded me of Shuffle where it starts out cutesy and then gets serious hearing the heartbreaking stories of the characters. The series is pretty emotional though alright. A lot of tears are shed by the characters. Sometimes it was necessary, and sometimes it was random. For the first 12 episodes I'd give it 3/5 for the next 12 episodes I give it 4/5. Once the anime jumps back into the main story it gets pretty interesting once again.I do kind of wish it allowed the main character to explore the other girls more outside of the one he choose. Seemed like it could have been interesting for him to come close with any of the other girls he befriended. Most of them were equally as nice and kind but in the end he chose who he wanted. Not that I had any problems with his selection but it just seemed unfair. I say that because some of the other girls seemed better suited for the main character. The Final episode on the set shows what I was thinking. Just how easily he could of been with one of the other girls because he makes a good match for just about any of them.Overall even though these type of drama/comedy animies aren't my style I can tell that this one was done pretty well. 3/5 for me personally but 4/5 because it doesn't deserve to be rated less. It's a quality show.btw the voice acting is really miscast for a lot of the characters. That was one of the reasons I couldn't get into it so much. For some voices it was perfect but for others it was like ""well...this little girl sounds like a 40 year old woman... I'll just go with it"". I'm familiar with Funimations usual voice cast...I'm just guess some of the other voice actors on their roster were doing other projects and they had to get who ever was free to do some of the roles. I'm guess on that one but that's really how it sounds.",4,Not really my cup of tea,1308355200,"06 18, 2011",2011,2160,"['did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'bad', 'anime', 'first', 'Volume', 'felt', '6', 'episodes', 'dragged', 'too', 'long', 'were', 'same', 'story', 'was', 'weird', 'switch', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'focus', 'main', 'girl', 'then', 'sudden', 'back', 'seat.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'been', 'fan', 'drama/comedy', 'animies', 'reminded', 'Shuffle', 'where', 'out', 'cutesy', 'then', 'serious', 'hearing', 'heartbreaking', 'stories', 'characters', 'series', 'pretty', 'emotional', 'alright', 'lot', 'tears', 'are', 'shed', 'characters', 'Sometimes', 'was', 'necessary', 'sometimes', 'was', 'random', 'first', '12', 'episodes', ""'d"", 'give', '3/5', 'next', '12', 'episodes', 'give', '4/5', 'Once', 'anime', 'back', 'main', 'story', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'once', 'again.I', 'do', 'kind', 'wish', 'allowed', 'main', 'character', 'explore', 'other', 'girls', 'more', 'one', 'Seemed', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'come', 'close', 'other', 'girls', 'befriended', 'Most', 'were', 'equally', 'nice', 'kind', 'end', 'chose', 'who', 'wanted', 'Not', 'had', 'problems', 'selection', 'just', 'seemed', 'unfair', 'say', 'other', 'girls', 'seemed', 'better', 'suited', 'main', 'character', 'Final', 'episode', 'set', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', 'Just', 'how', 'easily', 'could', 'been', 'one', 'other', 'girls', 'good', 'match', 'just', 'them.Overall', 'even', 'type', 'drama/comedy', 'animies', 'are', ""n't"", 'style', 'can', 'tell', 'one', 'was', 'done', 'pretty', 'well', '3/5', 'personally', '4/5', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'be', 'rated', 'less', 'quality', 'voice', 'acting', 'really', 'miscast', 'lot', 'characters', 'was', 'one', 'reasons', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'so', 'much', 'voices', 'was', 'perfect', 'others', 'was', 'well', 'little', 'girl', 'sounds', '40', 'year', 'old', 'woman', ""'ll"", 'just', 'go', ""'m"", 'familiar', 'Funimations', 'usual', 'voice', 'cast', ""'m"", 'just', 'guess', 'other', 'voice', 'actors', 'roster', 'were', 'doing', 'other', 'projects', 'had', 'get', 'who', 'ever', 'was', 'free', 'do', 'roles', ""'m"", 'guess', 'one', 'really', 'how']",Clannad Complete Collection

It has the right amount of humor, sentimentality, and honesty without leaving you with more than the other.Tomoya Okazaki is a bitter, sarcastic, pranker in his senior year of high school, spending most of his time ridiculing his friend and fellow lethargist, Sunohara.

1337794,A1C7BWPATO40VA,B003E51VUQ,Nathan T.,"[2, 2]","This is one of THE best anime series I've watched and I'm a avid anime watcher. I own over 100 different series, most of which are complete and have seen quite a few more. If you're interested in anime and you want to watch a good anime, look no further, Clannad will not disappoint you. It's on my top 5 anime series. Most balance in terms of humor, action, drama and love. It's a harem anime, at least in the first season, but it's not your typical harem anime where the main guy is a total loser and looks like a major geek.I'm going to write this review with some details intentionally cut out so it won't spoil the anime for you.Characters (Many of the main ones in no specific order)Tomoya - Main guy character.Nagisan - Main girl character. Shoulder length dark hair.Fuuko - Girl that carves starfish (commonly mistaken for ninja stars and stars)Ryou - One of the twin sister. Short blue hair with white ribbon.Kyou - Second twin sister. Long blue hair with white ribbon.Youhei Sunohara - Tomoya's best friend. Blond hair. Same age and similar height to Tomoya.Mei Sunohara - Sister of Sunohara. Little girl.Sanae Furukawa - Nagisan's mother. Long black hair.Akio Furukawa - Nagisan's father.Tomoyo - Commonly mistaken for Tomoya in terms of name. She is a girl with long white hair.Yukine Miyazawa - Dorm mother, person in charge of the dorm Youhei lives in. Usually wears an apron.Kotomi - Girl that reads books all the time at the library. Blue, short hair.Again, details are purposely left out so you can find out on your own.ANIME SERIES DETAIL:- There are 2 seasons and 1 movie.- The movie should be watched AFTER you finish the all the episodes because it is a summary of the first and final season. However, I would skip the movie altogether because the movie is not very good. If the episode series is a 10, the movie is a 5 at best. Very weak.- Each season has a finale at episode 22. The last few are either summaries or EXTRAS. Extras include different story switches or pre-series intro.There are about 2-3 extras after each season. So 24-25 episodes per season. Watch Clannad first and then Clannad: After Story.Clannad season 1 is about school life and first introduces Tomoya to Nagisan. The first season is significantly more humorous and is brilliantly balanced in terms of humor, drama, and love. It is more laid back but occasionally has some serious episodes that deal with life situations. The second season, however, is much more dramatic, but still retains enough balance to keep the anime enjoyable and the drama bearable. The second season deals a lot more with the serious side of reality and less of the goofy school days.This series will bring up all sorts of emotions from you. This anime is good enough to be declared brilliantly put together, a masterpiece. Do not skip this anime.",5,"One of THE Best Anime.

Yutaka not being there is also the reason why season 2 of Haruhi sucks as well, which he apoligized for. Don't worry though, Yutaka went out and created his own studio called Ordet with a number of great anime on it's way. Kannagi, from Ordet, was great!!!
