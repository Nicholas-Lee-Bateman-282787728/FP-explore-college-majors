976095,A8WA4SCPGPJ3,B000EPFCY0,cw of the Black Hills,"[0, 0]","The story is based on the true story of a charismatic  Ku Klux Klan leader in the 1920's, how he influenced good, conscientious citizenry of the Midwest to join and celebrate the Klan. It became almost completely respectable to be a part of it.  But  then his ego took over completely.  He ultimately caused the death of a well-liked and respected townswoman, leading to his own downfall, and the Klan's loss of power.  It's so difficult today, here and now, to realize the following this group achieved, that so many people can be persuaded to believe in something so ugly when it is disguised as high morality.  Although the film was made some years back, it's quality stands the test of time.  It is well-acted and is well worth watching, whether as pure entertainment or a bit of surprising history.",5,Ugliness puts on a pretty face,1403827200,"06 27, 2014",2014,803,"['story', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'charismatic', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'leader', '1920', 'how', 'influenced', 'good', 'conscientious', 'citizenry', 'Midwest', 'join', 'celebrate', 'Klan', 'became', 'almost', 'completely', 'respectable', 'be', 'part', 'then', 'ego', 'took', 'over', 'completely', 'ultimately', 'caused', 'death', 'well-liked', 'respected', 'townswoman', 'leading', 'own', 'downfall', 'Klan', 'loss', 'power', 'so', 'difficult', 'today', 'here', 'now', 'realize', 'following', 'group', 'achieved', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'persuaded', 'believe', 'something', 'so', 'ugly', 'when', 'disguised', 'high', 'morality', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'years', 'back', 'quality', 'test', 'time', 'well-acted', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'bit', 'surprising', 'history']",Cross Of Fire
