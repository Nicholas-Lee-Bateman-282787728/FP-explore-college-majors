Vivian Wu stars as a Japanese woman accustomed to being written upon by her father. To her shock, she learns that her father's publisher is exploiting him. She desires revenge. She finds a British lover (the ever-handsome Ewan McGregor, showing that again, the Force is strong in him) They become passionate lovers. While their love scenes are passionate and sensual, the music accompanying it is... surprisingly awful. She enjoys her British paramour, but thinks his calligraphy stinks. Instead, she writes on him, and sends him to the publisher. I won't spoil the horrific ending.""The Pillow Book"" is one of Peter Greenaway's more accessible movies. It doesn't have the brutality ofThe Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover,nor is it as esoteric asThe Draughtsman's ContractGreenaway is in the tradition of other British avant-garde filmmakers like Ken Russell and Derek Jarman. ""Pillow Book"" also shows that back in the '90s, art films weren't the glum, realistic things they are now. They were free to be surreal and dreamlike.

5125,AORW1FRF4D4KS,0767801962,azindn,"[38, 44]","The Pillow Book is a rare film that transcends limitations of film and text in a unique handling by auteur Peter Greenaway.  Based loosely on the tenth century writings of Sei Shonagon, Greenaway brings to the screen a  rich visual amalgam that relies on stunning settings, the physical beauty  of actors Vivian Wu and Ewan McGregor, and the joy of ancient and modern  systems of writing that is calligraphy.  Greenaway's penchant for  incorporating art, numbers, books, and architecture in a filmic medium  ensure those who enjoy his style will not be disappointed.As a young  child, Wu's character has celebrated her birthday's by having her father  write the story of creation on her face in a family ritual celebration.  However, with adulthood and marriage, her spouse is neither interested nor  willing to continue her tradition.  Frustrated at her inability to find a  lover who is a good calligrapher, or a calligrapher who is a good lover, Wu  finally meets a bi-sexual translator, Jerome (McGregor) who offers himself  to Wu as a living surface for her erotic creativity.  Inspired by the  opportunity to obtain revenge on the publisher who blackmailed her father  and is Jerome's lover, Wu's character, Nagiko creates the ultimate love  poem illuminated in red, gold and black characters and delivered to the  publisher on the naked body of Jerome.The Pillow Book is adult  eroticism at it's most sensuous and visual best.  It is a story that revels  in binaries of profane and grotesque, yet delights the eye with Greenaway's  ability to translate a vision of love and horror into a singular statement  of lush physical beauty and sexuality.  However, that said, it is also a film which is best viewed on the large screen as several elements of the film maker's medium include inset panels which include parallel scenes or present visual narratives of textual elements as they are voiced.  Additional calligraphied text reveal Nagiko's narratives from her own pillow book, a journal of musings and observations which detail her voiced narrations but on the small screen become illegible.  A second problemematic element is Greenaway's use of a 3/4th screen often creating the compositional balance in a negative space black band at the bottom of the screen. Some will find these kinds of articulations irritating although this kind of art as film in the hands of Greenaway is elegant and sublime on the theatrical full screen . A difficult film but worthy of all attention for lovers of unique film making.",5,Words Made Flesh,919296000,"02 18, 1999",1999,2518,"['Pillow', 'Book', 'rare', 'film', 'limitations', 'film', 'text', 'unique', 'handling', 'auteur', 'Peter', 'Greenaway', 'Based', 'loosely', 'tenth', 'century', 'writings', 'Sei', 'Shonagon', 'Greenaway', 'screen', 'rich', 'visual', 'amalgam', 'stunning', 'settings', 'physical', 'beauty', 'actors', 'Vivian', 'Wu', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'joy', 'ancient', 'modern', 'systems', 'writing', 'calligraphy', 'Greenaway', 'penchant', 'incorporating', 'art', 'numbers', 'books', 'architecture', 'filmic', 'medium', 'ensure', 'who', 'enjoy', 'style', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed.As', 'young', 'child', 'Wu', 'character', 'celebrated', 'birthday', 'having', 'father', 'write', 'story', 'creation', 'face', 'family', 'ritual', 'celebration', 'However', 'adulthood', 'marriage', 'spouse', 'neither', 'interested', 'willing', 'continue', 'tradition', 'Frustrated', 'inability', 'find', 'lover', 'who', 'good', 'calligrapher', 'calligrapher', 'who', 'good', 'lover', 'Wu', 'finally', 'bi-sexual', 'translator', 'Jerome', 'McGregor', 'who', 'Wu', 'living', 'surface', 'erotic', 'creativity', 'Inspired', 'opportunity', 'obtain', 'revenge', 'publisher', 'who', 'blackmailed', 'father', 'Jerome', 'lover', 'Wu', 'character', 'Nagiko', 'ultimate', 'love', 'poem', 'illuminated', 'red', 'gold', 'black', 'characters', 'delivered', 'publisher', 'naked', 'body', 'Jerome.The', 'Pillow', 'Book', 'adult', 'eroticism', 'most', 'sensuous', 'visual', 'best', 'story', 'binaries', 'profane', 'grotesque', 'yet', 'eye', 'Greenaway', 'ability', 'translate', 'vision', 'love', 'horror', 'singular', 'statement', 'lush', 'physical', 'beauty', 'sexuality', 'However', 'said', 'also', 'film', 'best', 'viewed', 'large', 'screen', 'several', 'elements', 'film', 'maker', 'medium', 'include', 'inset', 'panels', 'include', 'parallel', 'scenes', 'present', 'visual', 'narratives', 'textual', 'elements', 'are', 'voiced', 'Additional', 'calligraphied', 'text', 'reveal', 'Nagiko', 'narratives', 'own', 'pillow', 'book', 'journal', 'musings', 'observations', 'detail', 'voiced', 'narrations', 'small', 'screen', 'become', 'illegible', 'second', 'problemematic', 'element', 'Greenaway', 'use', '3/4th', 'screen', 'often', 'creating', 'compositional', 'balance', 'negative', 'space', 'black', 'band', 'bottom', 'screen', 'will', 'find', 'kinds', 'articulations', 'irritating', 'kind', 'art', 'film', 'hands', 'Greenaway', 'elegant', 'sublime', 'theatrical', 'full', 'screen', 'difficult', 'film', 'worthy', 'attention', 'lovers', 'unique', 'film', 'making']",N/A
5126,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,0767801962,C. B Collins Jr.,"[5, 5]","This is certainly a fascinating film with visual images that are unique and beautiful and disturbing.  There are several highly interesting aspects to the film that I would like to explore in this review.First, Peter Greenaway has the eyes of a visual artist. His attention to the odd detail is incredible and subtle. I found the film to be full of images that went beyond the story line and pentrated at an unconscious emotional level. The act of exploring the human body with a caligraphy brush, composing stories, poems, novels, autobiography is certainly a compelling image and concept. Isn't our life written on our bodies? Don't we read the bodies of those with whom we are intimate? Don't we in some way brand or stain the bodies of those whom we love and in turn are we not burned and molded by those who love us?  From the corpses of a young lover wrapped in indigo paper, to baths in ancient urns, the an army of handsome Japanese nude men covered in caligraphy, the film floods you with images. The storyline, the text, is only part of the story - a point I wish that those who did not like this film would recognize.Second, it is unique storytelling. Nagiko, a Japanese girl, adores here novelist father. She comes to understand however that he must submit to sodomy with his homosexual publisher to remain in print and prosperous. Nagiko marries and becomes an unhappy young bride. She runs away from her husband and Japan to Hong Kong where she eventually becomes a fashion model. She explores the concept of writing on the human body as her art form as she moves from lover to lover, experience to experience. She meets a handsome European translator, Jerome, and becomes fascinated with him once she learns he is the publisher's lover also. She seduces him and then gradually develops a plot of revenge against the publisher. Yet, she has met her sexual, artistic, intellectual, aethitic match in Jerome and they both know that their relationship is rare. She and Jerome plot to have her story read by the publisher while he is making love to Jerome and sees the caligraphy on Jerome's body. But this plot backfires terribly as Nagiko finds she can not bear the jealousy and she rejects Jerome. Jerome, the romantic, kills himself with a drug overdose. The publisher uncovers Jerome's body and has his skin turned into parchment so he can retain his lover in book form. Nagiko learns of this and wants the book, for Jerome's skin is her medium. Her revenge includes writing a series of tales of desire and experince on the bodies of handsome Japanese nude young men whom she sends to the publisher for publication. The publisher is captivated by the beauty of the work and the men and begins to publish her novels and poems. Yet in the end, Nagiko sends an assassin with the final chapter, the last of 12 books, who kills the publisher and retrieves the book composed of Jerome's skin.  I dare you to find a more odd story than this!This visual feast of the unconscious is not for everyone. It is only somewhat linear with flashbacks to Nagiko's childhood and sections from the Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon integrated throughout the film. Yet, the character of Nagiko, her cognitive association of writing with the body, made far more sense than many performance and conceptual artists in the art magazines.I was left with one haunting line, spoken by the 10th century courtesan who wrote the original pillow book in the title who says at the end: ""I have loved two things, literature and the body.""",4,Unique visual storytelling,1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,3514,"['certainly', 'fascinating', 'film', 'visual', 'images', 'are', 'unique', 'beautiful', 'disturbing', 'are', 'several', 'highly', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'film', 'would', 'like', 'explore', 'review.First', 'Peter', 'Greenaway', 'eyes', 'visual', 'artist', 'attention', 'odd', 'detail', 'incredible', 'subtle', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'full', 'images', 'went', 'story', 'line', 'pentrated', 'unconscious', 'emotional', 'level', 'act', 'exploring', 'human', 'body', 'caligraphy', 'brush', 'composing', 'stories', 'poems', 'novels', 'autobiography', 'certainly', 'compelling', 'image', 'concept', ""n't"", 'life', 'written', 'bodies', 'Do', ""n't"", 'read', 'bodies', 'whom', 'are', 'intimate', 'Do', ""n't"", 'way', 'brand', 'stain', 'bodies', 'whom', 'love', 'turn', 'are', 'not', 'burned', 'molded', 'who', 'love', 'corpses', 'young', 'lover', 'wrapped', 'indigo', 'paper', 'baths', 'ancient', 'urns', 'army', 'handsome', 'Japanese', 'nude', 'men', 'covered', 'caligraphy', 'film', 'floods', 'images', 'storyline', 'text', 'only', 'part', 'story', 'point', 'wish', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'film', 'would', 'recognize.Second', 'unique', 'storytelling', 'Nagiko', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'here', 'novelist', 'father', 'understand', 'however', 'must', 'submit', 'sodomy', 'homosexual', 'publisher', 'remain', 'print', 'prosperous', 'Nagiko', 'marries', 'unhappy', 'young', 'bride', 'away', 'husband', 'Japan', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'where', 'eventually', 'fashion', 'model', 'concept', 'writing', 'human', 'body', 'art', 'form', 'lover', 'lover', 'experience', 'experience', 'handsome', 'European', 'translator', 'Jerome', 'becomes', 'fascinated', 'once', 'publisher', 'lover', 'also', 'then', 'gradually', 'plot', 'revenge', 'publisher', 'met', 'sexual', 'artistic', 'intellectual', 'aethitic', 'match', 'Jerome', 'know', 'relationship', 'rare', 'Jerome', 'plot', 'have', 'story', 'read', 'publisher', 'making', 'love', 'Jerome', 'caligraphy', 'Jerome', 'body', 'plot', 'terribly', 'Nagiko', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'jealousy', 'Jerome', 'Jerome', 'romantic', 'drug', 'overdose', 'publisher', 'Jerome', 'body', 'skin', 'turned', 'parchment', 'can', 'retain', 'lover', 'book', 'form', 'Nagiko', 'book', 'Jerome', 'skin', 'medium', 'revenge', 'writing', 'series', 'tales', 'desire', 'experince', 'bodies', 'handsome', 'Japanese', 'nude', 'young', 'men', 'whom', 'publisher', 'publication', 'publisher', 'captivated', 'beauty', 'work', 'men', 'publish', 'novels', 'poems', 'end', 'Nagiko', 'assassin', 'final', 'chapter', 'last', '12', 'books', 'who', 'publisher', 'book', 'composed', 'Jerome', 'skin', 'dare', 'find', 'more', 'odd', 'story', 'visual', 'feast', 'unconscious', 'not', 'everyone', 'only', 'somewhat', 'linear', 'flashbacks', 'Nagiko', 'childhood', 'sections', 'Pillow', 'Book', 'Sei', 'Shonagon', 'integrated', 'film', 'character', 'Nagiko', 'cognitive', 'association', 'writing', 'body', 'made', 'far', 'more', 'sense', 'many', 'performance', 'conceptual', 'artists', 'art', 'magazines.I', 'was', 'left', 'one', 'haunting', 'line', 'spoken', '10th', 'century', 'courtesan', 'who', 'wrote', 'original', 'pillow', 'book', 'title', 'who', 'end', 'have', 'loved', 'two', 'things', 'literature', 'body']",N/A
5127,A3I7EHVQ4AAKFV,0767801962,"Christina ""Lisa""","[10, 12]","The Pillow Book is about book lovers.  You might think you are a book lover, but this film takes the concept, deconstructs it and takes it beyond your sensibilities  well my sensibilities, anyway.  It pushes the envelope  and whatever the envelope ever was. Greenway is not for your standard pop-corn munching movie watcher. There is a shock or two, less than in The Cook.  I will tell you that his storytelling is unique, operating on very quirky logic about love (although very poetic about parental love), vibrant in a celebration of perceived good provoking its world of nightmarish opposites. The characters are not very appealing spirits, but their motivations are interesting. This story is told in layers of images, the past folding on the present, reverence in battle with sacrilege, and life hiding in very stylized art.  Moving images are appliqued over other movie frames.  It is like opera.  There are a lot of arias for the eyes and some beautifully haunting music for the ears. At times, like in an opera the images sing together.  The erotic nature of the film is not just the nude bodies making love but the language and how it lives as a fetish and aspired toward immortality or mythology. My knowledge of Asian culture is very little, but The Pillow Book has indelibly taught me something, except I need to translate from the Japanese, the Chinese, the English, the Yiddish and the Greenway.",4,L ange vole ... l homme change,1091836800,"08 7, 2004",2004,1410,"['Pillow', 'Book', 'book', 'lovers', 'might', 'think', 'are', 'book', 'lover', 'film', 'concept', 'sensibilities', 'well', 'sensibilities', 'anyway', 'envelope', 'whatever', 'envelope', 'ever', 'was', 'Greenway', 'not', 'standard', 'pop-corn', 'munching', 'movie', 'watcher', 'shock', 'two', 'less', 'Cook', 'will', 'tell', 'storytelling', 'unique', 'operating', 'very', 'quirky', 'logic', 'love', 'very', 'poetic', 'parental', 'love', 'vibrant', 'celebration', 'perceived', 'good', 'provoking', 'world', 'nightmarish', 'opposites', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'appealing', 'spirits', 'motivations', 'are', 'interesting', 'story', 'told', 'layers', 'images', 'past', 'folding', 'present', 'reverence', 'battle', 'sacrilege', 'life', 'hiding', 'very', 'stylized', 'art', 'Moving', 'images', 'are', 'appliqued', 'other', 'movie', 'frames', 'opera', 'are', 'lot', 'arias', 'eyes', 'beautifully', 'haunting', 'music', 'ears', 'times', 'opera', 'images', 'sing', 'together', 'erotic', 'nature', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'nude', 'bodies', 'making', 'love', 'language', 'how', 'fetish', 'aspired', 'immortality', 'mythology', 'knowledge', 'Asian', 'culture', 'very', 'little', 'Pillow', 'Book', 'indelibly', 'taught', 'something', 'need', 'translate', 'Japanese', 'Chinese', 'English', 'Yiddish', 'Greenway']",N/A

5129,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,0767801962,Edmonson,"[0, 0]","""The Pillow Book"" (1996) is directed by Peter Greenaway (Prospero's Books). The movie is about an aspiring young writer named Nagiko (Vivan Wu), who as a child had a birthday greeting written on her face. The idea of having a birthday greeting of this kind was something she always looked forward to year after year, and as she grew older she searched for an ideal calligrapher-lover who would use her body as his personal writing paper. After many unfulfilled years of searching she finally comes across Jerome (Ewan McGregor) who is an English translator with connections to a publisher. Jerome convinces her that she should write her pillow book on his body as a way to deliver her manuscripts to the publisher. The multiple layering of images from various points of view creates a delicate collage of images that float like layers of transparent paper filled with calligraphy. The movie progresses through the thirteen books she writes, from ""The Book of The Agenda"", to the final book, ""The Book of the Dead"" with the rich layering of images unfolding in this tale of a young woman's search for her identity, and her perfect lover.",5,This book of love is multilayered....,1339718400,"06 15, 2012",2012,1136,"['Pillow', 'Book', '1996', 'directed', 'Peter', 'Greenaway', 'Prospero', 'Books', 'movie', 'aspiring', 'young', 'writer', 'named', 'Nagiko', 'Vivan', 'Wu', 'who', 'child', 'had', 'birthday', 'greeting', 'written', 'face', 'idea', 'having', 'birthday', 'greeting', 'kind', 'was', 'something', 'always', 'looked', 'forward', 'year', 'year', 'grew', 'older', 'searched', 'ideal', 'calligrapher-lover', 'who', 'would', 'use', 'body', 'personal', 'writing', 'paper', 'many', 'unfulfilled', 'years', 'searching', 'finally', 'Jerome', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'who', 'English', 'translator', 'connections', 'publisher', 'Jerome', 'should', 'write', 'pillow', 'book', 'body', 'way', 'deliver', 'manuscripts', 'publisher', 'multiple', 'layering', 'images', 'various', 'points', 'view', 'delicate', 'collage', 'images', 'float', 'layers', 'transparent', 'paper', 'filled', 'calligraphy', 'movie', 'thirteen', 'books', 'Book', 'Agenda', 'final', 'book', 'Book', 'Dead', 'rich', 'layering', 'images', 'unfolding', 'tale', 'young', 'woman', 'search', 'identity', 'perfect', 'lover']",N/A
5130,A1V3S3Y5KAPPZW,0767801962,Eric Anderson,"[37, 57]","I happen to be a great admirer of the controversial Mr Greenaway. I think his direction in film is bold and produces powerful results. The Pillow Book is a great example of this talent. It is an amazing combination of his narrative technique, experimental explorations and talent for finding compelling stories. The images are beautiful, especially the shot of Vivian Wu standing in the rain covered with writing on her flesh which slowly melts away. Her character is not that complex, but the action of the story is sufficient to carry her along throughout the tale as she fights for independence and a suitable form of artistic expression. Essentially the story is about the fetishisation of books and sex. These things are enough to make a great movie in my mind.  Nagiko is a girl who goes through a ritual where her father writes on her back on her birthday as he tells her of a myth. After burning her way out of a suffocating marriage, she grows up to become a radical artist writing on bodies and searching for a man who can replace her father in the birthday tradition. She meets a talented man named Jerome who she falls in love with, but is eventually sacrificed to her father's old enemy. In the course of the narrative she writes her own Pillow Book on a series of men. It culminates in a gruesome act of jealousy and revenge (a notion not foreign to Greenaway's narratives).The scene of Jerome's suicide is particularly powerful and works well with the screen-in-screen shots because it shows in one shot the sequence between thought and action, self-perception and actual action. This is a new style for Greenaway that works tremendously well in this movie because it fits so well with the egotism and self-obsession of the characters involved. The movie as a whole is a powerful evocation of a great Japanese classic. I highly recommend this movie who is in the mood to watch something eccentric, visually moving and stunningly beautiful.",5,A Finely Created Work of Art,979084800,"01 10, 2001",2001,1954,"['happen', 'be', 'great', 'admirer', 'controversial', 'Mr', 'Greenaway', 'think', 'direction', 'film', 'bold', 'powerful', 'results', 'Pillow', 'Book', 'great', 'example', 'talent', 'amazing', 'combination', 'narrative', 'technique', 'experimental', 'explorations', 'talent', 'finding', 'compelling', 'stories', 'images', 'are', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'shot', 'Vivian', 'Wu', 'standing', 'rain', 'covered', 'writing', 'flesh', 'slowly', 'away', 'character', 'not', 'complex', 'action', 'story', 'sufficient', 'carry', 'tale', 'independence', 'suitable', 'form', 'artistic', 'expression', 'Essentially', 'story', 'fetishisation', 'books', 'sex', 'things', 'are', 'enough', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'mind', 'Nagiko', 'girl', 'who', 'ritual', 'where', 'father', 'back', 'birthday', 'myth', 'burning', 'way', 'suffocating', 'marriage', 'become', 'radical', 'artist', 'writing', 'bodies', 'searching', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'replace', 'father', 'birthday', 'tradition', 'talented', 'man', 'named', 'Jerome', 'who', 'love', 'eventually', 'sacrificed', 'father', 'old', 'enemy', 'course', 'narrative', 'own', 'Pillow', 'Book', 'series', 'men', 'gruesome', 'act', 'jealousy', 'revenge', 'notion', 'not', 'foreign', 'Greenaway', 'narratives', '.The', 'scene', 'Jerome', 'suicide', 'particularly', 'powerful', 'well', 'screen-in-screen', 'shots', 'one', 'shot', 'sequence', 'thought', 'action', 'self-perception', 'actual', 'action', 'new', 'style', 'Greenaway', 'tremendously', 'well', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'egotism', 'self-obsession', 'characters', 'involved', 'movie', 'whole', 'powerful', 'evocation', 'great', 'Japanese', 'classic', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'who', 'mood', 'watch', 'something', 'eccentric', 'visually', 'moving', 'stunningly', 'beautiful']",N/A

Peter Greenaway is a unique artist and has created a touching story in a cinematic technique that is clearly his own.  Simply stated, The Pillow Book is a journal kept by Japanese women who write private thoughts about desire, beauty, sensuality, and the moments in life that are indescribably unforgetable.  In this story we see the unfolding of the life of a daughter of a calligrapher/writer who is able to provide for this beloved family and all their traditions by his assignations with his publisher.  The child is taught her father's skills, each birthday having her father write the story of creation on her face, signed by 'god' on her back.  This 'writing on the body' is eventually the means of gaining revenge on her father's demeaning publisher: she searches for the perfect lover (one who can make love as well as write beautifully in calligraphy) only to find a British translator (who happens to be the lover of her publisher)who encourages the girl to write her uniquely original books on his body - the matrix for delivery of her book to the publisher, a man who otherwise has rejected her gifts.  To reveal the ending would spoil the mesmerizing intrigue of the film.  Suffice it to say that love and honor eventually triumph...The techniques of cinematic magic include the simultneous use of Black and White photogrpahy with Color photography, screens within screens, still life within motion, the wonder of observing Japanese writing, the use of written scrolls superimposed on moments of story telling.

5138,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,0767801962,K. Driscoll,"[6, 6]","I've always viewed Peter Greenaway as a bit of an outlaw of sorts.  There was a time where I tried to appreciate his movies but found them pretentious, boring, and even somewhat gratuitous.  As I've matured I've begun to understand that the depth in most of his pictures is real and the meaning behind the visuals worthwhile, though sometimes I wished it would come with a guide.  In other words, it isn't always easy to understand Greenaway's movies.  Also, so very few of them are on DVD and I can't figure out exactly why.  One of his most notorious movies of all time;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, is on DVD but it's a hard one to get your hands on.  Probably his most notorious movie to those who have seen it and know what it is, is the hate provokingBaby of Macon, and that one we may never see distributed appropriately.  My favorite films of his areProspero's BooksandDrowning by Numbersand they are not available either.  That leaves me to review one of his movies that is on DVD, isn't always appreciated among Greenaway fans, but is probably his most accessible film yet.  Accessible, probably because it stars the hugely talented mainstream actor Ewen McGregor.The Pillow Book is a loose modernized telling of the memoirs of thesame titlewritten a thousand years ago by a woman who lived to serve a Japanese Empress.  It follows Nagiko (Vivian Wu), a Japanese model exploring her cultural and sexual surroundings in modern Hong Kong.  Jerome (Ewen McGregor), an English translator, is her favorite of multiple lovers.  The two share their common interests in calligraphy, art, poetry, and mutual attraction.  The betrayal they experience and the love they share is the superficial template for the first part of the film, but there are far more interesting things that develop as the film goes on.  Talking about how the film progresses would reveal too many surprises but the story changes gears and focuses more on Nagiko's passion for her writing, which is really what she is most intensely devoted to at this point in the movie.  Her father (Ken Ogata) influenced this passion back to when she was a child and her writings remained unpublished after being rejected by her father's rival, who, as the story treads forward seems to know how great her writing is.  Greenaway's ability to understand and play with multi-cultural symbols is a key factor to the success of Nagiko as a character and his ability to mend her passions by the film's conclusion is a success in terms of the film's resolution.Some filmmakers make confusing and cryptic movies (i.e. Jodoworsky, David Lynch) but for the most part it doesn't seem like it is as intentional as it is with Greenaway's movies.  He is a very imaginative director that seems to want to challenge the viewer to understand where he is coming from, for better or worse.  If you like that kind of film and the summary I've provided above sounds interesting to you then I would recommend The Pillow Book.  Some would say Greenaway's movies are an acquired taste and I would agree.

5140,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,0767801962,Lee Armstrong,"[9, 11]","""The Pillow Book"" is one of the most unusual films I've ever seen.  Nagiko is the daughter of a calligrapher who develops a fetish for having people write on her.  This leads her to want to become a published author using people's skin as the pages of her book.  It's an unusual premise.  As Nagiko, Vivian Wu is a driven and manipulative woman, willing to seduce at will to get what she wants.  Some have labeled this film as erotic because of the great amount of nudity contained, but Peter Greenaway's aesthetic distance from his characters is great, resulting in a certain coldness or clinical eye with which he views the characters.  Thus, it is not unusual to see reviewer reactions in which the nudity was not experienced as particularly moving or erotic; it just means that Greenaway's intention worked well.  From Wales, Greenaway was trained as an artist; and his sense of the visual pervades this film.  I particularly appreciated the way he overloads the visual information of the film by frequently having boxes within the frame showing another concurrent action or sometimes a flashback.One of the original aspects of the film came for me when the first nude Japanese calligrapher runs around chasing Nagiko with a paintbrush.  With a terrorist subplot, the police whisk in, swirl him away; and the film moves on.  Ken Ogata as Nagiko's calligrapher father has a brief but intense appearance as does Hideko Yoshida as Nagiko's aunt.  Yoshi Oida plays the gay publisher who ruins Nagiko's father and has a graphic relationship with a young expatriate Englishman named Jerome played by Ewan MacGregor.  There are a lot of naked Asian and Caucasian men throughout the film, most appearing with writing on their bodies.  Nagiko's books are quite creative.  I particularly like the book of silence as the naked man stands there wordlessly until he sticks out his tongue upon which is written the brief message.  Greenaway's cold eye toward the subjects is reflected as one of the books tumbles in the room revealing the last part of the anatomy that might usually remain hidden.  MacGregor turns in a good performance hitting the highs of romance, a strange homosexual affair, and the final torture of rejection.  While Greenaway employs about as much nudity as he did in telling Shakespeare's Tempest in ""Prospero's Books,"" it does not seem to be the point of the film.  Perhaps the point comes as we are told that two of the greatest pleasures are those of the written word and the flesh.  Not much is made of the spiritual in this film; but it was with a mixed reaction that I viewed the Lord's Prayer painted on a naked Nagiko.  This is a film for the more cinematically adventurous, but overall is a good viewing experience because it challenges how we view the world.

Although I am quite willing to admit my ignorance of Asian art, whether Chinese, Japanese or other, I think this movie can be enjoyed on its own terms.  Although the Pillowbook was confusing and disjointed to me at times, it was also intriguing and beautiful. For the previous reviewer to claim that all the characters acted in a monotone is simply untrue.  Vivian Wu gave a subtle, nuanced and deeply emotional performance, and Ewan McGregor was wonderful as Jerome.  Far from acting in a monotone, McGregor played Jerome with an infectious sense of fun during the early stages of his and Nagiko's relationship.  Later, when Nagiko rejects him, his agony is vividly expressed and quite palpable.  Additionally, to reduce this subtle and intense movie to &quot;a fetish for naked Asian men&quot; is patently unfair.

This one was recommended to me so I tried it.Although I didn't like this quite as much as the ones I'd seen previously, which were ""The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover,"" and ""The Draughtsman's Contract,"" I still enjoyed it, as I can still appreciate the surprisingly varied creativity and artistry Greenaway brings to the silver screen. I suspect the eclectic symbolism in the movie, as Greenaway combines art, architecture, photography, and even mathematics along with the calligraphy aspect, will probably elude most people. But the movie itself cleverly becomes a sort of a ""Pillowbook"" as the woman character flits from lover to lover trying to find one who is as good a calligrapher as he is a lover, and can cover her body with beautiful calligraphy to keep her father's tradition alive.As usual with Greenaway films, there is a dark side to this, as in the relationship between her father and his publisher, who is blackmailing her father (although ""black-balling"" might be a more appropriate term) but the main focus is on the Vivian Wu character, who finally encounters Ewan McGregor (who I recalled as the young Obiwan Kenobe from the Star Wars sequel). McGregor becomes the means to her revenge when she creates a beautiful love poem on McGregor's body for the unscrupulous publisher.

The Pillow Book is not it, though it's the first of his films I've seen that at least achieves the same level of competence and watchability as Little Voice.Peter Greenaway is known for creating plotless swirls of artistic film, and The Pillow Book did little to damage this reputation. It's less of a plot-based film than an extended character study of Nagiko (The Last Emperor's Vivian Wu), a woman obsessed with Sei Shonagon's erotic masterpiece The Pillow Book and determined to create a version of her own. During the course of her exploits, she meets Jerome (MacGregor), and the two start a tumultuous relationship. Nagiko has been trying to get her writing published by a top Japanese publishing house, headed by a character we know only as The Publisher (Madame Butterfly's Yoshi Oida), and is continually frustrated; Jerome hatches the idea of submitting her work not on paper, but on the bodies of men. Hilarity ensues.As with all Greenaway's movies, this is quite nice to look at, but it's got that empty calorie feeling to it; you enjoy it while it lasts, but it's not filling, and you feel vaguely guilty for having consumed so much of it at once without really remembering what it tastes like. ** ",3,"Not bad, but lackluster for Greenaway.",1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,1631,"['Pillow', 'Book', 'Peter', 'Greenaway', '1996', ""'ve"", 'long', 'had', 'hypothesis', 'bad', 'actor', 'one', 'good', 'movie', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Flatliners', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'A', 'Perfect', 'World', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'Taxi', 'Driver', ""'ve"", 'been', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'number', 'years', 'now', 'Ewan', 'MacGregor', 'used', 'up', 'allowance', 'Little', 'Voice', 'not', 'once', 'while', 'check', 'out', 'Ewan', 'MacGregor', 'flick', 'see', 'good', 'one', 'Pillow', 'Book', 'not', 'first', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', 'achieves', 'same', 'level', 'competence', 'watchability', 'as', 'Little', 'Voice.Peter', 'Greenaway', 'known', 'creating', 'plotless', 'swirls', 'artistic', 'film', 'Pillow', 'Book', 'did', 'little', 'damage', 'reputation', 'less', 'plot-based', 'film', 'extended', 'character', 'study', 'Nagiko', 'Last', 'Emperor', 'Vivian', 'Wu', 'woman', 'obsessed', 'Sei', 'Shonagon', 'erotic', 'masterpiece', 'Pillow', 'Book', 'determined', 'create', 'version', 'own', 'course', 'exploits', 'Jerome', 'MacGregor', 'two', 'start', 'tumultuous', 'relationship', 'Nagiko', 'been', 'trying', 'get', 'writing', 'published', 'top', 'Japanese', 'publishing', 'house', 'headed', 'character', 'know', 'only', 'Publisher', 'Madame', 'Butterfly', 'Yoshi', 'Oida', 'continually', 'frustrated', 'Jerome', 'idea', 'submitting', 'work', 'not', 'paper', 'bodies', 'men', 'Hilarity', 'ensues.As', 'Greenaway', 'movies', 'quite', 'nice', 'look', 'got', 'empty', 'calorie', 'feeling', 'enjoy', 'not', 'filling', 'feel', 'vaguely', 'guilty', 'having', 'consumed', 'so', 'much', 'once', 'really', 'remembering', 'what', '**']",N/A

The film then moves to the girl as an adult, and seeking lovers  who will write on her body again. She meets a bisexual Englishman, who also  likes to be written on, and she finds out he is also a former lover of a  man who has previously betrayed her father.Greenaway uses some of the  techniques from Prospero's Books, in the way the film is shown, with small  rectangular boxes containing other images. The film is beautiful to look  at, as per usual with Greenaway's films. There is also a seductive French  song that plays at times during the film, a sensuous lady performs this  tune, and it is very appropriate to the film. The film is erotic, with  plenty of nudity on view. I do think the film is a bit languid at times  though, and this hurts it, but it's still an impressive piece of cinema.The DVD picture are sound are both very good, but the disc could have  done with more extras.",5,"Sensual, erotic &amp; languid",967766400,"09 1, 2000",2000,979,"['beginning', 'film', 'see', 'little', 'girl', 'being', 'written', 'father', 'film', 'then', 'girl', 'adult', 'seeking', 'lovers', 'who', 'will', 'write', 'body', 'again', 'bisexual', 'Englishman', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'written', 'also', 'former', 'lover', 'man', 'who', 'previously', 'betrayed', 'father.Greenaway', 'techniques', 'Prospero', 'Books', 'way', 'film', 'shown', 'small', 'rectangular', 'boxes', 'containing', 'other', 'images', 'film', 'beautiful', 'look', 'usual', 'Greenaway', 'films', 'also', 'seductive', 'French', 'song', 'times', 'film', 'sensuous', 'lady', 'tune', 'very', 'appropriate', 'film', 'film', 'erotic', 'plenty', 'nudity', 'view', 'do', 'think', 'film', 'bit', 'languid', 'times', 'still', 'impressive', 'piece', 'cinema.The', 'DVD', 'picture', 'are', 'sound', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'disc', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'extras']",N/A

Even the ones that are not special in themselves embody meaning and subtlety. When Greenaway uses the figure to carry words, he creates imagery that can not be forgotten.There is so much in this movie that I hardly know where to begin. It starts with a child. Her father's birthday ritual is to tell her a story, always the same one, and to paint calligraphy on her face. Maybe it's a little silly, but it's sweet and loving.Over time, the girl loses her innocence but gains the strength of adulthood. Her memory of that charming ritual develops, too. First, it loses its childhood innocence; it becomes a passion for her, and the standard by which she measures her lovers. In the end, the ritual gains even more strength and becomes the vehicle for a deadly obsession.I must warn the potential viewer that the movie's second half goes places far beyond where sanity stops. It is not for people with tender sensibilities.I'll come back to this movie for it sensual beauty. I won't come back too often, though.
