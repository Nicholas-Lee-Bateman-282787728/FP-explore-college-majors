1364313,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B003UESJCY,Amit Talpade,"[1, 1]","Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors and at I look forward to seeing his work eagerly. Woody still writes a great script and his dialogues are so funny. He returns to London again to explore the shenanigans and troubled lives of individuals who are at crossroads in their relationships. Anthony Hopkins leaves his wife of many years Gemma Stone, shacks up with a woman many years his junior Lucy Punch, who has a roving eye and a shady past. Meanwhile Gemma Stone disturbed, resorts to seeking help from psychics to guide her future. Their daughter Naomi Watts is going through a crisis of her own with her marriage to once successful writer Josh Brolin, and is attracted to her boss Antonio Banderas, with problems of his own. Brolin on the other hand flirts with a seductive neighbor Freida Pinto, who starts having doubts about her marriage plans.While YWMATDS may not be Allen's work, it still can be rated as decent entertainment because it is extremely hard to resolve all the story lines in just 98 minutes or so. Most of the stories do not get a resolution and we are left hanging on.

From then on, it seems all too many 'relationship tales' all have one. Midnight in Paris, obviously one. It's uncomfortable to watch. We pretty much know 'this isn't going to turn out well', and it sure doesn't. The redeeming qualityis that those of us thinking, ' ""Hell, I can do better than this sorry relationship""...well, no you ain't. Pretty much NO body is likeable, no knights on dashing white steeds here, or damsels worth devoting your life to. Of course this makes the average 'chick lit' genre movie totally unrealistic. Okay...we hate each other; then we love each other, big problem solved, and happy ever after. When in truth, if we learned anything from this movie, they ain't no happy ever after. So that's the dilema then. Wouldn't we rather 'escape' from the ""dealt a bad hand"" relationship we are in? Or ..how to make it a good realtionship, even though the odds are against experiencing onein our lifetime. How to MAKE it good, in spite of the 72 box car train load of trauma, and eccentric peculiarities we bring to each and every one of our relationships?If you like the fairyland type romance movie, I recommend ""OPA""...in Greece, ( in all the news lately ) half in Greek with english subtitles, and English, no subtitles...rather nice. We need happy endings, it seems. ""Love and Other Drugs"" is better than this one...love triumphing over all odds against it...while simultaneously revealing the gargantuan, slobbering greed  of the drug industry.I think that is what is missing in this movie that is generating a pretty ho hum response. In spite of that, we do encourage more like this one, only better somehow. Probably most people reviewing movies like this deplore white knuckle endless torment, mind numbing , tortuous cruelties... hurtling cars bursting into fiery crashes.

1364316,A3G0TESLQF4HFK,B003UESJCY,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[2, 2]","I usually enjoy Woody Allen films and for the first ninety minutes of this ninety-nine minute film I did. Then something happened, it ended with no resolution of the stories, no nothing but looking back perhaps that was the point. As Shakespeare once sais life is all sound and fury signifying nothing. So too is You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger.It is a family story, and a tale of marriages unraveling. When the film begins, Helena (Gemma Jones) and Alfie (Anthony Hopkins) have recently divorced, their 40-year union unable to withstand his late-life crisis and her bouts of anxiety. He finds solace in a sports car and workout regiment; she ends up spending the lion's share of her time seeking the advice of a rather shady psychic, and making frequent (and unannounced) visits to their only offspring, Sally (Naomi Watts). But Sally's marriage to Roy (Josh Brolin) is in its own trouble; he's a novelist who hasn't been able to live up to the promise of his first book, and isn't doing much in the way of providing for their future, so she ends up going back into the workforce as the assistant to Greg (Antonio Banderas), a handsome gallery owner. Sally's attracted to her boss, while Roy is drawn to the lovely Dia (Freida Pinto), whose apartment window faces his office.There are twistsand turns aplenty from Allen's fine cast and the movie moves along quite well. The feeling is of real people relating to and with each other. Both Watts and Hopkins are a joy to watch. The entire ensemble cast holds its own quite well. The problem is that I wish there were more of the story. One becomes invested in the characters only to get no real sense of resolution/The film I screened was a standard definition DVD which presented great picture and clear sound. As usual with an Allen film it was a pretty bare bones affair with only a trailer as a bonus feature.Maybe life is in fact all sound and fury signifying nothing.

Amazon does not give us the ability to use half stars though so I had to pick a whole star.The old adage is to write what you know.  Woody Allen is now an old man.  Thus, when he writes about old characters for this film, it really works.  Anthony Hopkins is perfect as the long married husband who throws everything away in order to recover his youth.  He doesn't stand a chance, of course.  His ex prostitute young wife is great as she takes him for everything she can.  His ex-wife, played by Gemma Jones, is initially the upset one but she goes on to a much better life albeit with the spiritualists in present day London society.  They are kind of a bizarre group but she fits in and finds a life for herself there (so it could be underwater basketweaving instead and it would still work).Their child, played by Naomi Watts, is yet another of Allen's heroines from his earlier career.  She is whiny, demanding, shrill and is Allen's usual shiksa character (yawn).  This is the woman he has memorialized in film since the mid 1970s and I would like to see him jettison her as a character.  Naomi Watts does a decent enough job at playing her (as did Mia Farrow and Diane Keaton) but I am sick of this Allen character.  Not so, however, her husband, a real rat, played by the oh so talented Josh Brolin.  He can just about pull any movie together with his villainous roles.  He is assembling a real rogues' gallery of them, all of them wonderful.  This time he gives up being a doctor to be a writer, only in the end to encounter a medical twist of fate which is the funniest part of the movie. I found Brolin to be the most comic part of the movie.I really think this could have been a much better, funnier movie if the Naomi Watts character had been removed. I don't think Allen realizes how common mixed marriages have become and that the woman of 2011 who is or is not Jewish (or more likely of mixed parentage) is very different from the women whom he was pursuing in his hey day.  He's a lot more on beam when writing about the old woman and the prostitute her ex takes up with his doomed desire to reverse the clock.",4,Older Characters Much More Interesting Than Younger Ones,1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,2175,"[""'d"", 'say', '3.5', '4', 'star', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'not', 'give', 'ability', 'use', 'half', 'stars', 'so', 'had', 'pick', 'whole', 'star.The', 'old', 'adage', 'write', 'what', 'know', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'now', 'old', 'man', 'Thus', 'when', 'old', 'characters', 'film', 'really', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'perfect', 'long', 'married', 'husband', 'who', 'everything', 'away', 'order', 'recover', 'youth', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'course', 'ex', 'prostitute', 'young', 'wife', 'great', 'everything', 'can', 'ex-wife', 'played', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'initially', 'upset', 'one', 'much', 'better', 'life', 'spiritualists', 'present', 'day', 'London', 'society', 'are', 'kind', 'bizarre', 'group', 'life', 'herself', 'there', 'could', 'be', 'underwater', 'basketweaving', 'instead', 'would', 'still', 'work', '.Their', 'child', 'played', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'yet', 'Allen', 'heroines', 'earlier', 'career', 'whiny', 'demanding', 'shrill', 'Allen', 'usual', 'shiksa', 'character', 'yawn', 'woman', 'memorialized', 'film', 'mid', '1970s', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'jettison', 'character', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'decent', 'enough', 'job', 'playing', 'did', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'am', 'sick', 'Allen', 'character', 'Not', 'so', 'however', 'husband', 'real', 'rat', 'played', 'oh', 'so', 'talented', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'can', 'just', 'about', 'pull', 'movie', 'together', 'villainous', 'roles', 'assembling', 'real', 'rogues', 'gallery', 'wonderful', 'time', 'up', 'being', 'doctor', 'be', 'writer', 'only', 'end', 'encounter', 'medical', 'twist', 'fate', 'funniest', 'part', 'movie', 'found', 'Brolin', 'be', 'most', 'comic', 'part', 'movie.I', 'really', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'funnier', 'movie', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'removed', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Allen', 'how', 'common', 'mixed', 'marriages', 'have', 'become', 'woman', '2011', 'who', 'not', 'Jewish', 'more', 'likely', 'mixed', 'parentage', 'very', 'different', 'women', 'whom', 'was', 'pursuing', 'hey', 'day', 'lot', 'more', 'beam', 'when', 'writing', 'old', 'woman', 'prostitute', 'ex', 'up', 'doomed', 'desire', 'reverse', 'clock']",N/A

1364320,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003UESJCY,Chris Pandolfi,"[9, 25]","""It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""A narrator uses this Shakespeare quote to open Woody Allen's ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger,"" which is at great pains to make a point about how there is no point to be made. For any film, this would be a spectacularly bad premise. For a Woody Allen film, it's downright fatal. Here we are, being drawn into a story about the complexities of relationships, only to realize at the end that none of it has amounted to anything, that the whole thing is an exercise in unnecessary character development and storylines that go nowhere. If it were done artfully, say in a labyrinthine David Lynch dreamscape, perhaps then it could be excused. But Allen makes the dread mistake of presenting it realistically, meaning we will be tricked into investing in the plot. If I may be so bold as to borrow another Shakespeare quote, ""And oftentimes excusing of a fault doth make the fault the worse by the excuse.""Even now, I'm shaking my head in disbelief. What was Allen thinking? How could the man behind such wonderful films as ""Annie Hall,"" ""Love and Death,"" and ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" be the same man responsible for this mess? Rarely has a director cheated his audience so cruelly, so forcefully, so unapologetically. What exactly is the point in making a pointless film? To show that life has no meaning? Even if such a thing is true, I believe with every fiber of my being that there are far more constructive ways of sending this message; one cannot simply end ninety minutes of character-driven storyline by leaving everything unresolved.I will dutifully describe the plot for the sake of providing you with information. You should know, however, that it's a futile move on my part, since the ending makes it clear that none of it counts for anything. It's divided into a series of interconnecting subplots, all of which feature characters stuck in bad relationships with the wrong people. In London, we meet the neurotic and irrational Helena (Gemma Jones), who, since getting divorced, spends all her time paying visits to a crackpot fortune teller. This, in turn, leads her into the arms of an occult bookstore owner (Ashton Griffiths), a widower intent on contacting his dead wife via a s&eacute;ance. Her ex-husband, Alfie (Anthony Hopkins), became consumed with recapturing his youth and made it his mission to live a healthier lifestyle, move into a contemporary apartment, and hang out with much younger people. He has since met, and plans to marry, a tacky prostitute named Charmaine (Lucy Punch), who's less than half his age and isn't in it for anything other than his money.Meanwhile, Alfie and Helena's daughter, Sally (Naomi Watts), has a good eye for art and wants to someday open her own gallery. Unfortunately, she doesn't have the money for it and must once again rely on her mother for a loan. She must also contend with her American husband, Roy (Josh Brolin), who's a trained doctor but gave up on medicine in order to become a writer. He managed one successful novel, although all other attempts at writing have failed; he's currently awaiting a response from a publisher regarding his latest manuscript. As he sits on pins and needles, he catches the eye of Dia, his neighbor across the street (Freida Pinto), who always wears red and provocatively undresses in front of her window. She's already engaged, but it seems she's flattered by Roy's flirtatious advances. As it so happens, Sally is attracted to her boss, an art gallery owner named Greg (Antonio Banderas), who's having marriage problems of his own.As you can see, what we have here is a series of complicated issues. What infuriates me is that Allen uses this not as an opportunity to intelligently explore themes of connectivity and meaning; this time around, the characters have no purpose and their situations have no significance. If he tells us up front that it makes no difference what happens and who it happens to, then for the love of God, why bother developing the characters in such detail? Why bother making the movie at all? Essentially, we've already been told that absolutely nothing will be gained by seeing it.It doesn't help that just about every actor is horribly miscast, which is disappointing since they've all proven themselves worthy in other films. Josh Brolin, Anthony Hopkins, and Antonio Banderas are particularly ill fitting, none able to convey the emotional turmoil of Allen's script or even capture the basic conversational style of his dialogue. ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" is a grave miscalculation - a strained, unfocused, incomplete, unpleasant endeavor that elevates nihilism to stratospheric heights. It isn't often a movie so dramatically shoots itself in the foot; to place all emphasis on pointlessness, for both the story and the characters, is to make it impossible for an audience to connect with it. Woody Allen is a gifted filmmaker, which only makes this movie's failure that much more confounding.",2,Making it a Point to Be Pointless,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,5019,"['tale', 'told', 'idiot',

As with most of Allen's films, the characters are engaging and interesting, the dialog is intelligent and holds the story together. And the direction keeps the story fluid and entrancing. You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger may not be the best Woody Allen film... but it certainly ranks up there with the best of his most recent work... along with Midnight In Paris or Melinda & Melinda. I can only add that the actors all give fine performances. I particularly like Anthony Hopkins in his role. And, while, Josh Brolin does an adequate job, I think his character of the novelist (or maybe just his performance) is the only minor flaw of this otherwise wonderful Woody Allen comedy.",4,A quality Woody Allen film,1349913600,"10 11, 2012",2012,796,"['typical', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'not', 'meant', 'demean', 'worth', 'rather', 'compliment', 'quality', 'most', 'Allen', 'films', 'characters', 'are', 'engaging', 'interesting', 'dialog', 'intelligent', 'story', 'together', 'direction', 'story', 'fluid', 'entrancing', 'Will', 'Meet', 'A', 'Tall', 'Dark', 'Stranger', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'certainly', 'up', 'there', 'best', 'most', 'recent', 'work', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'can', 'only', 'add', 'actors', 'give', 'fine', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'role', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'adequate', 'job', 'think', 'character', 'novelist', 'maybe', 'just', 'performance', 'only', 'minor', 'flaw', 'otherwise', 'wonderful', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'comedy']",N/A
1364322,AOS5ZBTQX7QIT,B003UESJCY,D. Barbour,"[6, 20]","Woody Allen is a very talented director. This is obviously something he is trying to hide while parading around his latest ""comedy"", the abysmal ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger."" This hideous movie wastes so much talent, not to mention my time, that buying it will be one of the biggest purchasing mistakes you'll make.When an eccentric mother visits a psychic to try and cope with being left by her husband for a younger woman, she begins to impact the lives of all those around her by forcing the crazy paranormal readings on everyone she talks to. These people include a struggling writer, a conflicted middle-aged woman, a beautiful musician, and an art collector. Despite these interesting characters, the movie is not pleasant and the story is not believable. I wouldn't mind the believability thing had there been any fun or humor at all (there isn't) - it is a comedy with nothing to laugh about or at.Naomi Watts, Anthony Hopkins, Antonio Banderas, Josh Brolin, and Frieda Pinto are just some of the very talented people who obviously just wanted to add ""worked with Woody"" to the back of their headshots, because there is no other reason to be involved with such a terrible flick.

1364323,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003UESJCY,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","With a Woody Allen film, I always come with an expectation of an enjoyable time.  A few films have been misses but for the majority of Woody Allen's oeuvre, they have been its, not all masterpieces but still, with a filmmaking career that has spanned over 50 years, even now, you can't help but enjoy a Woody Allen romantic comedy.Which brings us to his latest film ""You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger"", a film that literally is split amongst film critics.  Some who feel that the 75-year-old Woody Allen can never match his style of filmmaking during his peak and others who feel that he is able to create enjoyable films.In ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"", I look at this film as a story of karma biting one back in the rear.VIDEO:""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  As usual with Woody Allen films, he tries to bring out the city he films in.  In this case, London.  Collaborating once again with his cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond (""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"", ""The Witches of Eastwick""), who worked with Allen in his last London-based film ""Cassandra's Dream"" (2007).While the film does provide some parts of London and possibly one awesome shot in the rain when Roy gets to meet Dia, most of the film is shot indoors especially inside Sally and Roy's apartment.  For the most part, the lighting is good and picture quality definitely shows a vibrancy at times, especially when focusing on Dia's red dress.  Skin tones are good and you can see Roy's shaggy hair (Probably one of the worst hair styles in the film for Josh Brolin) to a tired and disheveled Sally (Watts).But overall, the picture quality is very good, colors range from natural to vibrant, black levels are nice and deep and I saw no hint of artifacting or banding.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" is presented in English and French LCR DTS-HD MA.  The film is pretty much a dialogue and music-driven film.  Most of the scenes are with two people talking and there may be scenes with crowds (like at a bar) but for the most part, this is a dialogue-driven film and most of the sound is coming through the front and center channels.  There was one scene with heavy rain but I was expecting a more immersive sound at that point but I didn't really hear it coming from the surround channels.  So, for the most part, dialogue is clean and understandable as with its jazzy music (which works for this film and a style that Woody Allen is known for), the lossless soundtrack is good but don't expect anything  immersive.Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:It is well-known that Woody Allen is not fond of special features and no matter what release you watch of his, the most you're going to get from a Woody Alley DVD or Blu-ray is a theatrical trailer.  And the theatrical trailer of ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" (1:36) is included.JUDGMENT CALL:When Woody Allen created ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"", his reasoning to create the film was because of his interest in the concept of ""faith in something"".  Those who successfully delude themselves seem happier than those who can't.What I got out of this film were two things.  One, the power of faith and believing something positive and the other is ""karma"" and how it can come back to get you.For a Woody Allen film, at first glance, ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" is quite interesting in how Allen is able to take a normal family and easily throw believable things that can literally destroy it.  In the case of this family, Helena is the matriarch but she is so opinionated and blunt that it upsets those around her.  She can't stop, its her nature to say how she feels.  While she seems like it's right, others don't feel that same way.  And thus karma gets her in which her husband leaves her and alienates her family.But where Helena manages to redeem herself is finding faith, even though the person she believes in, may not be genuine (ala fortune teller), she's happy and the changes she makes in her life leads to happiness.On the other hand, for Alfie, it's one thing to not like getting badgered by your wife but leaving her to pursue a young woman (a prostitute) and try to live young and live a luxurious lifestyle which he shouldn't have done.  You don't know how much you miss someone until their gone and in Alfie's case, he finds himself in a situation where he goes for a very sexual woman that attracts men and the fact that he is older, he realizes that her lifestyle and how she is...it's too much for him and will probably lead him to a quick death because now he constantly worries about her promiscuity and how much of his money she spends.And for the daughter Sally, she wants a better life as her once famous novelist of a husband doesn't make money nor can he hold a job.  She wants to grow in her relationship but its not happening.  While most audiences probably may feel sympathetic to her character, the problem is that she is the person that helped egg her mother on to going to a fortune teller in order to make her happy and while it's a success, it ultimately becomes the major force in hurting Sally.As for Sally's husband Roy, the problem lies in the fact that he starts becoming a voyeur and falls for the woman across the street, gets closer to her and prevents her from finding happiness with another man she is to marry and does the unthinkable by stealing a dead man's novel and gets it published.  Unfortunately, karma will end up biting him in the rear as well.And the film comes full circle with the fact that Helena does find happiness thanks to her newfound faith in a crooked fortune teller.""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" was definitely a delightful film that has enough of Woody Allen's humor to make it enjoyable.  But I can see why some people watching this film may feel it was a bit of a drag.  Because really, it's not a film about happy endings, happy marriages and such.  It is a movie about a dysfunctional family and how it begins to impact those into making impulsive decisions.  There is no fighting for the marriage, there is no counseling, these characters think they found their way out by finding love elsewhere.Gemma Jones does a wonderful job of portraying Helena as a neurotic and paranoid woman.  Anthony Hopkins plays an older man finding a second wave of youthfulness.  Naomi Watts does a great job of playing the wife who wants more and Josh Brolin as the husband and voyeur.  Everyone in this film manages to play their role quite well and Lucy Punch was a much better choice in playing Charmaine and there is just no way I can see Nicole Kidman, who was originally supposed to play Charmaine, in that role.  And Freida Pinto brought a more elegant side to the film as she is the total opposite of Sally.Overall, ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" may not be a Woody Allen classic and I know many film critics feel that he's just churning out movies that do not reach the levels of the types of films he once created.  But I do believe that every filmmaker goes through various life differences, adjustments in life and as much as some would like original Woody Allen ala 1970's, it's surely not going to happen.So, far I have managed to enjoy a lot of Allen's later films and while they may not have the resonance of ""Manhattan"", ""Sleeper"" or ""Annie Hall"", they are still quite enjoyable and fun.""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" was delightful!",3,Blu-ray: Woody Allen returns with a karma-esque romantic comedy,1300233600,"03 16, 2011",2011,7524,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'always', 'come', 'expectation',

1364325,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B003UESJCY,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 4]","In the most familiar ways, this cynical 2010 chamber piece feels like a typical late-period Woody Allen roundelay of marital disappointments, romantic longing, and all points in between. But instead of the vibrancy he showed inMatch PointandVicky Cristina Barcelona, Allen retreats back to the more lackluster plot machinations ofCassandra's DreamandMelinda and Melinda. The result is a cinematic disappointment that makes me wonder how interested Allen is in entertaining an audience versus filming existential morality plays. The great Vilmos Zsigmond (Close Encounters of the Third Kind) is credited as the cinematographer, but his camerawork is quite dull here and the London locales are not used to any great effect.The labyrinth plot focuses on Roy, a one-time doctor who hit it big with his first novel years ago only to suffer from a severe case of writer's block afterward. He is henpecked by his sexually frustrated wife Sally who in turn, becomes smitten with handsome art gallery owner Greg. Sally and Roy receive unexpected drop-ins from her mother Helena who dispenses unsolicited advice she gets from dotty psychic Cristal. Helena has been seeing Cristal in order to figure out what to do with her life now that her husband Alfie has left her in the midst of a desperate bout of male menopause. Alfie has impetuously rediscovered his youth with a blowsy prostitute named Charmaine, who becomes his materialistic trophy wife. Meanwhile, Roy has become infatuated with a pretty musicologist named Dia whom he stares at through his and Sally's apartment window. Against her better judgment, Dia is attracted to Roy, and this triggers an act of deception that leads to undesirable consequences for all concerned. As has been his habit, Allen has recruited a cast of well-known actors to play the characters, but the resulting performances are uneven and sometimes unfocused.Stuck with a bad perm, Josh Brolin has to play the self-absorbed Roy with conviction, but he fails to draw us into his character's artistic angst or moral dilemma. Naomi Watts fares marginally better, capturing Sally's frustration and longing with surprising &eacute;lan, even as her character shows her true colors at the end. As Alfie, Anthony Hopkins looks bored and acts rather embarrassed by his character's increasing desperation. Lucy Punch probably fares the worst as Charmaine since she has to play the dumb-blonde stereotype with no room for adding dimension.

Woody Allen, 2010, 98 mins.) is not Woody Allen's strong suit, though I found it reminiscent in a shadowy way of those first annoying pieces he made starting back in the 1980s. You know, back when he finally and totally lost his touch for humor.In London, the viewer is dropped suddenly into the lives of a sad little family. Two old folks break up and try going it alone. Their daughter is trapped in an awful marriage with a worthless lout of a husband - and this is only the beginning of what will be a sometimes yawn-inducing, sometimes indigestion-generating excuse of a film.Now just look at the lineup Allen got for this: Sir Anthony Hopkins. Gemma Jones. Antonio Banderas. Naomi Watts. Josh Brolin. Nearly everyone completed their shoots in a day. I suppose there is a message herein: be careful what you wish for, I don't know. Frankly I do not care. Allen wasted 98 minutes of my life with this, and as is often said, I'll never get them back.In truth, I wonder in confusion why directors and actors go for silly, limp ideas like this. Truly, I wonder: Is it something like vacation time for a serious actor? Is it a rare break like a working vacation? Is it desperation fired by the idea that the r&eacute;sum&eacute; will go completely flat? Honestly, I cannot tell. Why would anyone waste their time, including Allen?Whatever it is that stinks, the main thing is you know it's dead. When the film seems to rely on the unnecessary, nasal narration of some unidentified little weasel, as the stupid jazz soundtrack fades in and out annoyingly... what else can I tell you?In any case, do not waste your time/money on this claptrap.

One of them takes the form of the specter of death, the same specter whose people's fear of keeps them in a state of hysteria. Being in this state, of course, allows them to avoid focusing on the unknown (whatever is waiting for them after death), and drives them to desperation, where they commit all sorts of crazy acts (in this film: infidelities, excessive drinking, avoiding acting one's age, visiting psychics, stealing other people's intellectual property, and other types of avoidance behavior).The other tall dark stranger takes the form of b.s. predictions of the future (""you will meet a tall dark stranger"") fed to one of the lead characters by a well-paid phony psychic, predictions that the character swallows whole, phony predictions that nevertheless have an uplifting, empowering effect on the character. All of the main characters in this film are running from the specter of death in some way or another, but it's the character that visits with the psychic who is the only one with a life line of sorts. The psychic predictions that the character wholeheartedly believes in delude her; but they keep her propped up, and in some small ways allow her to move forward. (To reiterate, the more b.s. you believe in, the better off you are.)So, then, the tall dark stranger is both something that the characters run from (the specter of death) and, in the case of one of the characters, a diversion from the something that they run from (a phony psychic's predictions of the future).And what both of these tall dark strangers have in common is that they prevent us from facing life in a more head-on fashion. They prevent us from living calmer lives. More rational lives. Lives that could be lived with more gratitude and perhaps with more kindness and understanding.-------------------------------------------------------------------------This film will go down in Wood Man history as one of his most underrated films.  This film is every bit as good as the next entry in his body of work, the mega-blockbuster ""Midnight in Paris.""In an attempt to explain the overwhelming popularity of that film, Owen Wilson, the star of that film, has hypothesized that it had just as much or more to do with the title of the film, Midnight in Paris, than with anything else.Tall Dark Stranger, in my mind, is every bit as entertaining and funny and profound and well-acted and well-filmed and well-lit and well-edited as Midnight In Paris.And what a cast! In addition to some terrific actors that we are familiar with in the U.S., including Josh Brolin and Anthony Hopkins and Naomi Watts, there are a number of not-so-well-known British actors that give some very fine performances, including Gemma Jones and the hilarious Lucy Punch.Why this film did not do better critically or commercially is a mystery to me.",4,As good as anything else Woody Allen has ever made...,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",2013,3023,"['Wood', 'Man', 'treatise', 'old', 'adage', 'more', 'b.s', 'believe', 'better', 'are', 'title', 'are', 'essentially', 'two', 'tall', 'dark', 'strangers', 'flitting', 'about', 'film', 'One', 'form', 'specter', 'death', 'same', 'specter', 'people', 'fear', 'keeps', 'state', 'hysteria', 'Being', 'state', 'course', 'avoid', 'focusing', 'unknown', 'waiting', 'death', 'desperation', 'where', 'commit', 'sorts', 'crazy', 'acts', 'film', 'infidelities', 'excessive', 'drinking', 'avoiding', 'acting', 'one', 'age', 'visiting', 'psychics', 'stealing', 'other', 'people', 'intellectual', 'property', 'other', 'types', 'avoidance', 'behavior', 'other', 'tall', 'dark', 'stranger', 'form', 'b.s', 'predictions', 'future', 'will', 'meet', 'tall', 'dark', 'stranger', 'fed', 'one', 'lead', 'characters', 'well-paid', 'phony', 'psychic', 'predictions', 'character', 'whole', 'phony', 'predictions', 'nevertheless', 'have', 'uplifting', 'empowering', 'effect', 'character', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'running', 'specter', 'death', 'way', 'character', 'psychic', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'life', 'line', 'sorts', 'psychic', 'predictions', 'character', 'wholeheartedly', 'delude', 'keep', 'propped', 'up', 'small', 'ways', 'allow', 'move', 'forward', 'reiterate', 'more', 'b.s', 'believe', 'better', 'are', 'So', 'then', 'tall', 'dark', 'stranger', 'something', 'characters', 'run', 'specter', 'death', 'case', 'one', 'characters', 'diversion', 'something', 'run', 'phony', 'psychic', 'predictions', 'future', 'what', 'tall', 'dark', 'strangers', 'have', 'common', 'prevent', 'facing', 'life', 'more', 'head-on', 'fashion', 'prevent', 'living', 'calmer', 'lives', 'More', 'rational', 'lives', 'Lives', 'could', 'be', 'lived', 'more', 'gratitude', 'perhaps', 'more', 'kindness', 'understanding.', '-This', 'film', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'Wood', 'Man', 'history', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'films', 'film', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'next', 'entry', 'body', 'work', 'mega-blockbuster', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'attempt', 'explain', 'overwhelming', 'popularity', 'film', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'star', 'film', 'hypothesized', 'had', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'more', 'do', 'title', 'film', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'anything', 'else.Tall', 'Dark', 'Stranger', 'mind', 'bit', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'profound', 'well-acted', 'well-filmed', 'well-lit', 'well-edited', 'Midnight', 'Paris.And', 'what', 'cast', 'addition', 'terrific', 'actors', 'are', 'familiar', 'U.S.', 'including', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'are', 'number', 'not-so-well-known', 'British', 'actors', 'give', 'very', 'fine', 'performances', 'including', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'hilarious', 'Lucy', 'Punch.Why', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'better', 'critically', 'commercially', 'mystery']",N/A

L'hoir,"[10, 11]","I found some of the comments that ""Tall Dark Stranger"" was about 'absolutely nothing' ironic, because the voiceover at the beginning of the film, quoting ""Macbeth,"" informs viewers exactly of what they are going to see: a story ""full of sound and fury, signifying nothing!""As usual, Allen has assembled an outstanding cast, including Gemma Jones, Naomi Watts, Anthony Hopkins, and Antonio Banderas. Jones is especially endearing as Hopkins' neurotic ex-wife and the mother of the equally neurotic Watts. Josh Brolin plays Watts's rather obnoxious husband, who is attracted to Freida Pinto,  charming as the lady in red, who inhabits the window of his dreams in the flat across the courtyard.  Lucy Punch is convincingly downmarket as Hopkins' enticing squeeze, and Banderas plays Watts's plausible (if dodgy) boss with panache. Allen emphasises the hopes and aspirations of his characters effectively with his lush but intimate musical score, which includes pop, jazz, opera, chamber (Mozart) and classical guitar (Boccherini). The scrumptious London settings provide a perfect background for his characters, and make the film a very enjoyable place for the viewer to while away a couple of hours.One of the things I love about Woody Allen's films is their unpredictability. Even though they hold recurrent themes, no two are exactly alike. They always contain surprises that delight, if one accepts them on their own terms. ""Tall Dark Stranger"" is a celebration of life in all its randomness and unpredictability. It is about the grass always seeming greener elsewhere; about possibility; about hope, that last spirit remaining in Pandora's box. In other words, it is about each one of us living our separate lives, which sometimes touch one another, and then, unexpectedly, move off in random directions.",5,Allen's Random Harvest,1322697600,"12 1, 2011",2011,1806,"['found', 'comments', 'Tall', 'Dark', 'Stranger', 'was', ""'absolutely"", 'nothing', 'ironic', 'voiceover', 'beginning', 'film', 'quoting', 'Macbeth', 'viewers', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'story', 'full', 'sound', 'fury', 'signifying', 'nothing', 'usual', 'Allen', 'assembled', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'including', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Jones', 'especially', 'endearing', 'Hopkins', 'neurotic', 'ex-wife', 'mother', 'equally', 'neurotic', 'Watts', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Watts', 'rather', 'obnoxious', 'husband', 'who', 'attracted', 'Freida', 'Pinto', 'charming', 'lady', 'red', 'who', 'window', 'dreams', 'flat', 'courtyard', 'Lucy', 'Punch', 'convincingly', 'downmarket', 'Hopkins', 'enticing', 'squeeze', 'Banderas', 'Watts', 'plausible', 'dodgy', 'boss', 'panache', 'Allen', 'hopes', 'aspirations', 'characters', 'effectively', 'lush', 'intimate', 'musical', 'score', 'pop', 'jazz', 'opera', 'chamber', 'Mozart', 'classical', 'guitar', 'Boccherini', 'scrumptious', 'London', 'settings', 'provide', 'perfect', 'background', 'characters', 'make', 'film', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'place', 'viewer', 'while', 'away', 'couple', 'hours.One', 'things', 'love', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'unpredictability', 'Even', 'hold', 'recurrent', 'themes', 'two', 'are', 'exactly', 'alike', 'always', 'contain', 'surprises', 'delight', 'one', 'own', 'terms', 'Tall', 'Dark', 'Stranger', 'celebration', 'life', 'randomness', 'unpredictability', 'grass', 'always', 'seeming', 'greener', 'elsewhere', 'possibility', 'hope', 'last', 'spirit', 'remaining', 'Pandora', 'box', 'other', 'words', 'one', 'living', 'separate', 'lives', 'sometimes', 'touch', 'one', 'then', 'unexpectedly', 'move', 'off', 'random', 'directions']",N/A
1364331,A2BPDFR58H9575,B003UESJCY,Galina,"[6, 7]","You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, the latest Woody Allen's film is light, airy, lacy, elegant, sad, bittersweet and tender, just like a Boccherini musical piece for guitar that a beautiful young woman was playing sitting next to the window in a London apartment/flat. It is also funny, sharp, mocks the absurdity of existence, and manages to highlight the insignificance and callousness of the characters yet not to judge them while letting them search for ""bell' alma inamorata"", and are not we all searching? Allen is still the master of his craft, the creator of charming dra-medies. His favorite and constant themes of lives and deaths of the relationships, of growing older and refusing to accept it, of trying to postpone the inevitable meeting with a ""tall dark stranger"", of struggle to find the reason in a tale, ""full of sound and fury"", are all here. But he knows how to look at the familiar material from the unusual angle by mixing masterfully humor and seriousness, light touch and insight in the right proportions to explore the desires, longings, and motivations of the characters. One of the themes Allen was interested while working on the Tall Dark Stranger was faith in something because it is for humans to prefer the power of self-delusions over the darkness of bitter truths. He said: ""This sounds so bleak when I say it, but we need some delusions to keep us going. And the people who successfully delude themselves seem happier than the people who can't."" Sounds too serious but it is Allen's film, and is ironic, witty, and light. I ask myself why I love Allen's films so much and always wait for them impatiently. One of the reasons, he makes them for adults and about adults. His target audiences want to see a clever intelligent film without being manipulated or spoon fed. I admire Allen for respecting his viewers: ""I never write down to them. I always assume that they're all as smart as I am . . . if not smarter"". Or, more likely, I love his films because the beauty lies in the eye of the beholder, and my eyes are always open to the beauty of his films. They are so perfectly constructed and framed. They look and sound terrific. While watching them, I don't understand how can they not be liked and admired by everyone? His short films are not small to me.

This time, in YOU WILL MEET A TALL DARK STRANGER he admixes frustrated relationships with lust and a dollop of 'ppychic readings' and comes up with a fun if uneven little film. As usual he surrounds himself with a fine cast of actors who are able to make the most out of Allen's outline for a microscopic examination of human behavior.Helena Shebritch (Gemma Jones) is consulting  'clairvoyant' Cristal (Pauline Collins) regarding the request for divorce from her gadabout husband Alfie (Anthony Hopkins) who is courting a hooker named Charmaine (Lucy Punch).  Helena and Alfie's daughter Sally (Naomi Watts) is disgusted with both her parents and is in the midst of coping with her MD educated turned writer's block novelist husband Roy (Josh Brolin).  Fed up with their static life Sally seeks and gains employment with art gallerist Greg (Antonio Banderas), and in her need for attention falls in lust with him, despite the fact that he is married and seemingly unavailable until she discovers Greg is having an affair with gallery artist Iris (Anna Friel).  Roy spends his days gazing at  guitarist Dia (Freida Pinto) who lives across the way in the next apartment.  Roy serendipitously comes on a novel (by a comatose friend) he can 'sell' and with his self worth strengthened he courts Dia who is in an arranged marriage contract.  Inappropriate Cristal is the one who oversees all of the derring-do with miscalculated predictions - except for Helena who meets widower Jonathan (Roger Ashton-Griffiths) in a s&eacute;ance oriented lifestyle.

1364337,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B003UESJCY,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 6]","After going back to New York for his grossly underrated 2009 filmWhatever Works, Allen travels once again to London for his latest effort. I've noticed that since Allen releases a new film at such a fast rate that many strong films are overlooked when compared to his previous works. As I have a substantial appreciation for Allen's films, I try to watch each new film of his as a stand-alone film without comparing it to his previous work. However, when he makes a film covering themes of life, death, love, and faith while telling a story of morally conflicted characters it becomes difficult to not think of the film in the context of where it belongs in Allen's film canon. You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger is not as bad as you've heard, not as good as some of Allen's best films but quite good as a stand-alone effort.Helena Shebritch (Gemma Jones) begins seeing a fortune teller to cope with her divorce from husband Alfie (Anthony Hopkins). One day Alfie awoke, realized his fear of growing old, and left Helena setting himself up with a nice car and a bachelor pad. Their daughter Sally (Naomi Watts) works at an art gallery and is married to Roy (Josh Brolin), who quit medical school after deciding to become a writer. Roy has written one successful novel and has spent years trying to complete another. This suddenly seems possible when Roy discovers his muse in the form of Dia (the gorgeous Frieda Pinto) who has moved into the apartment across the street. Meanwhile, Alfie decides to marry an ""actress"" half his age named Charmaine (Lucy Punch) while Sally considers having an affair with her boss Greg (Antonio Banderas).You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger has a very light tone to it. It's not quite a comedy, but it never quite identifies itself as a drama either. There is some darkly funny material as well as some dramatic conflict, yet it never plays too light or too heavy. The best way to describe it may be ""Woody Allen lite."" For a film that lasts only 90 minutes, there's a lot going on and it moves at a brisk pace with never a dull moment. I wanted the film to be longer, as I don't think Allen took his themes, conflicts, and characters as far as he could have and as far as I wanted him to. In the last few minutes of the film Allen brings each character's storyline to an ambivalent end, with the exception of Helena's. By ending it on Helena, it's wrapped up nicely and I was fond of the ending if editing had moved (for example) the end of Sally's storyline to the end of the film, we'd be left with something quite maddening. While there are other imperfections, I find the film's loose ends to be one of the most troubling.Arguably the film's biggest flaw is the voice-over narration. Allen's use of voice-over doesn't seem necessary (in fact, it seems to serve to tell us things we already know or as an excuse to move the plot elsewhere), but the biggest problem lies not in the narration but in the narrator. Zak Orth's narration actually takes some of the film's credibility away. It's not that it just doesn't work; it cheapens the film and seems more appropriate for a bad made-for-TV movie. There's no consistency to its appearance and it somehow throws off the film's tone. I can safely say the film would be better without it.As one would expect, Allen has assembled a marvelous cast. Many reviews I've read seem adamant that not just some, but every role was miscast which I staunchly disagree with. What kind of performances are people expecting from a film like this? The actors don't need to be hilariously funny nor do they need to be theatrically dramatic. Let's take Naomi Watts and Frieda Pinto for example. Watts plays a beautiful, cultured woman who develops a crush on her boss. In a different film, this would give an actress the opportunity to tap into the lust that drives this woman to contemplate violating the sanctity of her marriage. Allen's script doesn't call for that and, in that regard; Watts does a fine job playing Sally. Pinto has to be convincing as a gorgeous, intelligent woman who would fascinate and intrigue an onlooker. This is perfect casting! The other actors fare well too. Hopkins is a joy to watch, playing the charming older man determined to be young again with great comedic fervor. Who knew Hopkins had such humorous facial expressions? Brolin plays Roy, arguably the conflicted character, both cynical and optimistic. Brolin handles both of these traits convincingly and is darkly funny at times, although some may not appreciate that. When the character is at his most cynical, I found Brolin to be very amusing. I was intrigued by the Roy character, but especially as played by Brolin. The heart and soul of the film is the terrific Gemma Jones as Helena. It's unfortunate that this film received such negative notices, as Jones deserved some recognition for her work here. It's almost a clich&eacute; to talk about the lack of good roles for older actresses, but it's true that there are rarely juicy, dynamic roles for them. How unfortunate it is though that Jones gets one of those roles and receives little attention because Allen's film doesn't hold up to some of his masterworks in the eyes of critics.While Allen may struggle to tie his themes together or explore them at depth, he hasn't lost his knack for writing terrific, thoughtful dialogue. As expected, this is a film completely driven by the conversations character's have with each other and, while they're not the easiest people to identify with sometimes, I found his characterization to still be up to par as well. The first time I watched this film I had such low expectations that I loved it. The second time, the flaws became more apparent but I still enjoyed these characters. Allen has a rather extreme tendency to write things for people to say that they could not get away with in real life. Some would call Roy's first lunch with Dia creepy while I found it amusing, a break from the typical, worthless small talk that occurs in movies during a first encounter.You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger meanders between comedy, drama, and morality play but is still a really good film. The characters are fascinating, the cast is marvelous, and while not the most thought-provoking of Allen's work, it's an intelligent, charming, and entertaining work. I don't love this film and it's not one of Allen's career best but it's better than some lesser director's best films. In the end, I like this film more than I've liked some ""better"" films from 2010. When it comes down to personal preference; this is not one of the best films of 2010, but I liked it more than some of the ""best"" films I saw last year. Just shows how flawed the star-rating system can be. Take a chance on this movie; it's a validation of how consistent Allen is even while putting out one film a year. If this was Woody Allen's first film rather than his fortieth, I think people would be much kinder to it.GRADE: B+",4,"Flawed, But Better Than You've Heard",1295395200,"01 19,

Or deal with the paradox that humans seem to need something to believe in, and yet that same belief can also lead us astray?

Many funny, some serious, one thing that can be said is that they are always original and that his characters have some brilliant dialogue to offer. But not all of his films are the greatest thing since sliced bread.I'll be up front here and state that I like movies I watch to be entire stories. I want a beginning, a middle and an end. For me I want the whole shebang. Unfortunately this film doesn't offer that and because of that by the credits I felt that I had been gypped, that I'd just spent and hour and a half waiting for a story only to discover that it has no end.The tale revolves around several couples and their love lives. Helena Shebritch (Gemma Jones) has recently been dumped by her husband Alfie (Anthony Hopkins) after many years together. Alfie was having a late midlife crisis, fearing he was getting old and seeing that in Helena.Their daughter Sally (Naomi Watts) is married to Roy Channing (Josh Brolin), a man who received his degree in medicine only to toss it aside to become a writer. After a well received first novel, Roy has had little luck with subsequent stories and is currently trying to finish his fourth.But Roy is distracted by the new neighbor across the way from their apartment, a young woman named Dia (Freida Pinto). As his infatuation develops, the arguments with his wife increase as well. Then again since the two of them are living on money supplied by her mother, things naturally fall apart.Sally takes a job at an art gallery to help pay the bills. Her employer Greg (Antonio Banderas) appreciates the work she does for him and realizes she has an exceptional eye when it comes to discovering new artists. The possibility of a romance creeps at the edges of their scenes together and we, the viewers, wait to see if she will follow in the footsteps of nearly everyone else in the film that seem to fall in love at the drop of a hat.Alfie also has a new woman in his life. Sure she's half his age, but he sees it as true love. After only two months together he announces his intention marry her. What he doesn't announce is that she was a call girl he fell in love with. But with the help of modern medicine he hopes to have the son he always wanted.Back to Helena. From the start she spends time with a psychic she puts all of her faith in, Cristal (Pauline Collins). While those around her see Cristal as just a con artist trying to take Helena for as much as she can, Helena sees her as a spiritual guide who predicts all that happens to everyone else. She even helps her to find a new love herself.Are you with me here? This story is not as convoluted as you might think. The back and forth dialogue and story never get boring. The film is well made and entertaining in various ways. As a cautionary tale, it works. At other times as the lives of the characters unfold, it's like watching a train wreck. Through it all the characters seem quite real. But is there no person in this world happy with marriage?As I said, the major problem I had with this film was the ending. Actually I don't even know if you could call it an ending. Marriages, divorces, problems with future plans and more happen but as I said by the time the credits roll only one set of characters have come to any sort of conclusion. The rest are in limbo leaving you wondering just what happened when the screen went to black.Allen has been a big fan of foreign films, mostly those of Ingmar Bergman. His more serious films have always had that sort of tint to them. While ending a film without letting the viewer in on what happens to the characters might be an artistic leap, it left me feeling as though I'd been cheated out of a story. For those who don't mind films that just seem to stop, there is a good chance you'll find more to like here than I did.",2,LOVE LOST,1297728000,"02 15, 2011",2011,3832,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'Many', 'funny', 'serious', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'are', 'always', 'original', 'characters', 'have', 'brilliant', 'dialogue', 'offer', 'not', 'films', 'are', 'greatest', 'thing', 'sliced', 'bread.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'up', 'front', 'here', 'state', 'like', 'movies', 'watch', 'be', 'entire', 'stories', 'want', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'want', 'whole', 'shebang', 'Unfortunately', 'film', ""n't"", 'offer', 'credits', 'felt', 'had', 'been', 'gypped', ""'d"", 'just', 'spent', 'hour', 'half', 'waiting', 'story', 'only', 'discover', 'end.The', 'tale', 'several', 'couples', 'love', 'lives', 'Helena', 'Shebritch', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'recently', 'been', 'dumped', 'husband', 'Alfie', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'many', 'years', 'together', 'Alfie', 'was', 'having', 'late', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'fearing', 'was', 'getting', 'old', 'seeing', 'Helena.Their', 'daughter', 'Sally', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'married', 'Roy', 'Channing', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'man', 'who', 'received', 'degree', 'medicine', 'only', 'toss', 'aside', 'become', 'writer', 'well', 'received', 'first', 'novel', 'Roy', 'had', 'little', 'luck', 'subsequent', 'stories', 'currently', 'trying', 'finish', 'fourth.But', 'Roy', 'distracted', 'new', 'neighbor', 'way', 'apartment', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Dia', 'Freida', 'Pinto', 'infatuation', 'arguments', 'wife', 'increase', 'as', 'well', 'Then', 'again', 'two', 'are', 'living', 'money', 'supplied', 'mother', 'things', 'naturally', 'fall', 'apart.Sally', 'job', 'art', 'gallery', 'help', 'pay', 'bills', 'employer', 'Greg', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'work', 'realizes', 'exceptional', 'eye', 'when', 'discovering', 'new', 'artists', 'possibility', 'romance', 'creeps', 'edges', 'scenes', 'together', 'viewers', 'wait', 'see', 'will', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'else', 'film', 'seem', 'fall', 'love', 'drop', 'hat.Alfie', 'also', 'new', 'woman', 'life', 'Sure', 'age', 'true', 'love', 'only', 'two', 'months', 'together', 'intention', 'What', ""n't"", 'announce', 'was', 'call', 'girl', 'fell', 'love', 'help', 'modern', 'medicine', 'have', 'son', 'always', 'wanted.Back', 'Helena', 'start', 'time', 'psychic', 'faith', 'Cristal', 'Pauline', 'Collins', 'see', 'Cristal', 'just', 'con', 'artist', 'trying', 'take', 'Helena', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'Helena', 'spiritual', 'guide', 'who', 'everyone', 'else', 'even', 'find', 'new', 'love', 'herself.Are', 'here', 'story', 'not', 'as', 'convoluted', 'might', 'think', 'back', 'forth', 'dialogue', 'story', 'never', 'get', 'boring', 'film', 'well', 'made', 'entertaining', 'various', 'ways', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'other', 'times', 'lives', 'characters', 'unfold', 'watching', 'train', 'wreck', 'characters', 'seem', 'quite', 'real', 'there', 'person', 'world', 'happy', 'marriage', 'said', 'major', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'ending', 'Actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'could', 'call', 'ending', 'Marriages', 'divorces', 'problems', 'future', 'plans', 'more', 'happen', 'said', 'time', 'credits', 'roll', 'only', 'one', 'set', 'characters', 'have', 'come', 'sort', 'conclusion', 'rest', 'are', 'limbo', 'leaving', 'wondering', 'just', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'screen', 'went', 'black.Allen', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'foreign', 'films', 'mostly', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'more', 'serious', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'sort', 'tint', 'ending', 'film', 'letting', 'viewer', 'what', 'characters', 'might', 'be', 'artistic', 'leap', 'left', 'feeling', ""'d"", 'been', 'cheated', 'story', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'films', 'just', 'seem', 'stop', 'good', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'find', 'more', 'here', 'did']",N/A

The plot flows along well; the characters are developed nicely as the movie progresses; and there is a certain type of humor about it all that drew me in and entertained me. The casting was wonderful; and I liked the way the cinematography and the choreography enhanced the film. In addition, the music for the film fit in very well.When the action starts, we quickly meet several main characters: there is the extremely neurotic, very pessimistic Helena Shebritch (Gemma Jones) whose life fell apart with a suicide attempt after her husband of roughly forty years, Alfie (Anthony Hopkins), leaves her in a late midlife crisis and takes up company and even marriage with sleazy call girl Charmaine (Lucy Punch). Meanwhile, Helena's daughter Sally (Naomi Watts) lives with her going-nowhere fast failed novelist husband Roy (Josh Brolin) who wouldn't consider a career in what he studied--medicine--even though it would give them financial security. Helena doesn't realize it; but her daughter Sally, worried about her mother's deep depression, has connected her with a fraudulent fortune teller, Cristal (Pauline Collins), who simply tells Helena what she wants to hear to build up Helena's self-confidence.But, of course, many complications ensue. Roy is very nervously waiting for a publishing company to say they want to market his latest novel; and Roy is also pretty jealous that one of his poker playing buddies Henry (Ewen Bremner) has just finished a novel that is brilliant, at least in Roy's opinion--Roy is the only person Henry shows his book to for fear that it just won't be good enough to be published. While Roy waits for the publishing company to tell him yes or no about his own new book, he slowly but surely falls for the lovely Dia (Freida Pinto) who lives across the way and who Roy can feast his eyes on which delayed Roy's completing his novel.Of course, there's much more to the plot but I won't give it all away; no spoilers here! Look for some very good performances by Anna Friel as an artist named Iris; Antonio Banderas as Greg, the art gallery owner where Sally gets a job as his assistant; Roger Ashton-Griffiths as Jonathan and Neil Jackson as Alan, Dia's fianc&eacute;.Overall, You Will Meet a Tall, Dark Stranger provided me with a few good laughs; there is also some dry wit that left me relatively satisfied. The ending leaves us in some doubt about what will happen to one or two characters, but I could pretty much fill in most of the blanks myself as I think you will be able to do, too. I recommend this for anyone who likes Woody Allen's films; and people who are fans of the actors in this movie would do well to add this to their collections.",4,"""Don't you yell at my daughter--that's MY job !!!""",1298851200,"02 28, 2011",2011,2814,"['Will', 'Meet', 'Tall', 'Dark', 'Stranger', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'Woody', 'Allen', 'best', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'weakest', 'effort', 'either', 'plot', 'along', 'well', 'characters', 'are', 'developed', 'nicely', 'movie', 'certain', 'type', 'humor', 'drew', 'entertained', 'casting', 'was', 'wonderful', 'liked', 'way', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'enhanced', 'film', 'addition', 'music', 'film', 'fit', 'very', 'action', 'quickly', 'meet', 'several', 'main', 'characters', 'extremely', 'neurotic', 'very', 'pessimistic', 'Helena', 'Shebritch', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'life', 'fell', 'apart', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'husband', 'roughly', 'forty', 'years', 'Alfie', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'late', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'up', 'company', 'even', 'marriage', 'sleazy', 'call', 'girl', 'Charmaine', 'Lucy', 'Punch', 'Meanwhile', 'Helena', 'daughter', 'Sally', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'going-nowhere', 'fast', 'failed', 'novelist', 'husband', 'Roy', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'career', 'what', 'studied', 'medicine', 'even', 'would', 'give', 'financial', 'security', 'Helena', ""n't"", 'realize', 'daughter', 'Sally', 'worried', 'mother', 'deep', 'depression', 'connected', 'fraudulent', 'fortune', 'teller', 'Cristal', 'Pauline', 'Collins', 'who', 'simply', 'Helena', 'what', 'hear', 'build', 'up', 'Helena', 'self-confidence.But', 'course', 'many', 'complications', 'ensue', 'Roy', 'very', 'nervously', 'waiting', 'publishing', 'company', 'say', 'want', 'market', 'latest', 'novel', 'Roy', 'also', 'pretty', 'jealous', 'one', 'poker', 'playing', 'buddies', 'Henry', 'Ewen', 'Bremner', 'just', 'finished', 'novel', 'brilliant', 'least', 'Roy', 'opinion', 'Roy', 'only', 'person', 'Henry', 'book', 'fear', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'published', 'Roy', 'waits', 'publishing', 'company', 'tell', 'yes', 'own', 'new', 'book', 'slowly', 'surely', 'lovely', 'Dia', 'Freida', 'Pinto', 'who', 'way', 'who', 'Roy', 'can', 'feast', 'eyes', 'delayed', 'Roy', 'completing', 'novel.Of', 'course', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'spoilers', 'here', 'Look', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'artist', 'named', 'Iris', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Greg', 'art', 'gallery', 'owner', 'where', 'Sally', 'job', 'assistant', 'Roger', 'Ashton-Griffiths', 'Jonathan', 'Neil', 'Jackson', 'Alan', 'Dia', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Will', 'Meet', 'Tall', 'Dark', 'Stranger', 'provided', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'also', 'dry', 'wit', 'left', 'relatively', 'satisfied', 'ending', 'leaves', 'doubt', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'one', 'two', 'characters', 'could', 'pretty', 'much', 'fill', 'most', 'blanks', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'too', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'actors', 'movie', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'add', 'collections']",N/A

At least, the tone of the film starts out in that direction, but aside from a few mild chuckles along the way, the movie isn't really very funny.The actors are all excellent.  Allen's direction is fine and several of the multiple character story lines certainly have laugh-out-loud potential.  But, sadly, the guffaws never come.As is often the case in Woody's movies, the characters in this picture are seeking happiness on the other side of the fence, but when they get there, they find that the grass is not as green as they thought.Filmed in London, the movie features Anthony Hopkins as a successful businessman who leaves his wife (Gemma Jones) of forty years and, eventually, winds up marrying a hooker (Lucy Punch).  Jones, in the meantime, falls under the influence of a phony fortune-teller (Pauline Collins), who convinces her that she has lived before, probably in Elizabethan times.Both of these situations contain tremendous comic possibilities, yet for some reason, Woody didn't pursue them, or if he did, the humor doesn't come off.Hopkins and Jones have a daughter (Naomi Watts), married to struggling writer Josh Brolin.  Their relationship is also in trouble, with Brolin fawning over the beautiful woman (Freida Pinto) in the apartment across the way and Naomi falling in love with her married, philandering boss (Antonio Banderas).Not wanting to be a Spoiler, I won't be specific, but I wonder if this film might have worked better if some of the more interesting events that occur in the ""third act"" had taken place earlier in the movie.  That would have definitely raised ""the stakes,"" and allowed us (i.e. the audience) to become more involved with the characters.Despite these flaws, I remain a Woody Allen fan and look forward to seeing his next film.

Moore,"[0, 2]","Woody Allen's ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" simmers entertainingly for a while, thanks largely to a gifted cast, but it never comes amywhere near a boil. This is because the characters are neither interesting nor likable. Gemma Jones, as a flighty, severely depressed woman who finds solace in the occult, comes closest to gaining our sympathy; her scenes with a fortune teller played by Pauline Collins are the best in the movie. As a big fan of ""The Duchess of Duke Street,"" I'm delighted to see Jones in such a prominent part.However, everyone else is boring--even the great Anthony Hopkins, because his character is the same dull beige as all the other characters. ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" had a similar problem, only ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" doesn't have Penelope Cruz or the scenery of Barcelona to compensate us. There is a beguiling plot twist involving Josh Brolin, as a failed novelist, and his friend's unpublished manuscript, and it's mordantly amusing how Allen keeps that plot angle dangling over Brolin's head, like the sword of Damocles. However, that story line and Gemma Jones' performance aren't enough to make the movie satisfying in the end. I don't mind that the various storylines are inconclusive, but I DO mind that I didn't really care how or if they concluded.

Making matters worse, her father recently left her superstitious mother, who fills the void by spending a lot of time at their house, sharing unsolicited advice she receives from her ""psychic"" advisor.  Her father, meanwhile, has fallen for a much younger woman, who admires his bank account more than anything else, and simply cannot see (or admit) that there's no chance it will work long term.While technically a comedy, this one doesn't have any of the laugh-out-loud one liners that you often find in Woody Allen flicks.  It's more along the lines ofVicky Cristina Barcelonathan, say,Scoop.  It's a relationship comedy, where you can't help but cringe as the characters make what are obviously unwise decisions, based on gut feeling rather than on thinking through the consequences.  The irony of the film is that while everyone laughs at the mother's gullible reaction to the psychic who sells her what she wants to hear, each of them follows their gut rather than their head when it comes to making important decisions that will affect their lives for the future.  Even more, the film suggests, it may just be that naivety and gullibility (combined with a little bit of luck) are precisely what it takes to remain happy in love.

What an interaction! She is so charmed by him, so endearing.Gemma Jones plays indeed well.What makes this movie worth forgetting?Josh Broshlin in the role of Roy as an aspiring writer/artist is quite unconvincing.The budding affair between Roy (Broshlin) and Dia (Freida Pinto) was of a painful low quality, I would say; apparently written without appropriate care and poorly acted; in short: unconvincing.For me the good aspects of this movie are clearly more enjoyable than the weak aspects are disappointing.",3,sufficiently entertaining,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,1336,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'later', 'period', '1998', '/', 'now', 'comparatively', 'weak', 'period', 'movie', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'Anything', 'else', 'Match', 'point', 'Vicky', 'Christina', 'Barcelona', 'maybe', 'Scoop.The', 'movie', 'set', 'London', 'entertaining', 'weak', 'points.Two', 'couples', 'appear', 'movie', 'just-divorced', 'Alfie', 'Antony', 'Hopkins', 'Helena', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'daughter', 'Sally', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'who', 'married', 'Roy', 'Josh', 'Broshlin', 'attention', 'fresh', 'hopes', 'four', 'characters', 'branches', 'out', 'towards', 'others.What', 'movie', 'seeing', 'frustration', 'main', 'characters', 'especially', 'enjoyable', 'tension', 'annoyance', 'Helena', 'Sally', 'Roy.The', 'falling', 'love', 'Sally', 'gallery-owner', 'Greg', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'least', 'three', 'delightful', 'scenes', 'well', 'written', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'What', 'interaction', 'so', 'charmed', 'so', 'endearing.Gemma', 'Jones', 'plays', 'indeed', 'well.What', 'movie', 'forgetting', 'Josh', 'Broshlin', 'role', 'Roy', 'aspiring', 'writer/artist', 'quite', 'unconvincing.The', 'budding', 'affair', 'Roy', 'Broshlin', 'Dia', 'Freida', 'Pinto', 'was', 'painful', 'low', 'quality', 'would', 'say', 'apparently', 'written', 'appropriate', 'care', 'poorly', 'acted', 'short', 'unconvincing.For', 'good', 'aspects', 'movie', 'are', 'clearly', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'weak', 'aspects', 'are', 'disappointing']",N/A

After seeing YOU WILL MEET A TALL DARK STRANGER, it's obvious why Woody Allen is much more highly regarded--and respected-in France than the U.S.  The French appreciate films about relationships--especially Rohmer's films about relationships, such as MY NIGHT AT MAUD'S, CLAIRE'S KNEE, SUMMER, PAULINE AT THE BEACH, BOYFRIENDS AND GIRLFRIENDS, AN AUTUMN TALE, etc.  Like Woody's recent films--especially MATCH POINT and VICKY CHRISTINA BARCELONA--YOU WILL MEET A TALL DARK STRANGER follows in the same footsteps.  The common denominator amongst those films is FATE or PREDESTINATION.  Woody seems to be saying that no matter what we do, things will work out in their own way.  He is getting much more Zen-like in his golden years.  Although YOU WILL MEET A TALL DARK STRANGER wasn't as funny like MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY, ANNIE HALL or PLAY IT AGAIN SAM nor was it as deep like CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, HANNAH AND HER SISTERS, or MANHATTAN--it is still a worthwhile film to see.

We're among that handful of odd types you see lining up at the multi-plex the day his films premiere.  And while the critics haven't been kind to Mr. Allen in recent years, we nearly always find something to savor.  Until now.While death and the frantic scramble for meaning have always been central themes in his movies, his own nihilism, his enduring inability to find meaning in this universe, seems to strangle the very life out of this movie.  As death looms ever larger and more imminent, it has come to eclipse everything else.  The void at the center of his universe has shoved everything else to the sidelines- sex, humor, meaning, you name it.While the cast of characters are nicely crafted and painfully believable, there's barely a laugh in this newest endeavor.  He doesn't even bother to try to be funny anymore.  The contempt he seems to feel for his little creations now even extends to the 'Woody' character.  While for years he would himself play or have an actor depict a much older man with a gorgeous young thing, and make it all appear perfectly natural and normal, now he has Anthony Hopkins brilliantly enact an empty transaction with a soulless whore, pumping his life savings into her in a mad obsession with his onrushing mortality.Having savaged born again Christianity in his last outing,Whatever Works, this time it's new age beliefs that are the object of his contempt.  It seems belief of any kind, in anything, now strikes him as ludicrous.

He'll probably make you laugh too. There's an honesty about his writing that's often lacking in similar films.You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger is about an old married couple, a younger married couple and a few single people who are woven into the mix. They all live in London, England. The older couple is Helena (Jones) and Alfie (Hopkins) and they are separated. Helena reacts by trying to commit suicide and Alfie by proposing to Charmaine; a woman half his age.Their daughter, Sally (Watts), has a relationship with both parents and is married to Roy (Brolin). Sally and Roy have become bored with each other and are starting to notice other people. Sally has a crush on her boss, Greg (Antonio Banderas), while Roy has his eye on an attractive neighbor, Dia (Pinto).Helena regularly visits a psychic who assures her that her life is about to get better. She will find a new love and be happy. Sally plays along to keep her mother happy and hopeful.We learn that Alfie's wife-to-be is called Charmaine and he lies about how they met. She was actually a call girl. Her motivation seems to be to take Alfie for all the money he has. Roy meets Dia for lunch and continues to pursue her even when he learns that she's engaged. Sally doesn't notice Roy's behavior because she's too busy spending time with Greg.Roy's other motivation in life is finding a publisher for his latest book. His first was a success, but he's having trouble selling his fourth. When tragedy strikes some of his friends, Roy's true nature becomes clear.The four principal characters are all flawed. They lie routinely to protect their fragile relationships and we rarely see a true exchange between them. When we do, the outcome is usually damaging to their relationships.Each character has hopes and dreams and is willing to make big changes in order to fulfill them. All four suffer setbacks when their lies and unethical behavior catches up with them. These are not bad people; they are just tired with their boring existence. It's human nature to reach for something better, but it's not always easy to do so without hurting people you are supposed to love.Allen is a master at exposing the weaknesses in people. He realizes that we all have them to some degree. His actors all do the material justice and I would expect nothing less from such a talented group.The stories and subplots held my attention throughout. I found myself wanting to see what happened to these well-defined characters. There are a few twists and turns and Allen doesn't tell us what happens to every character. He doesn't need to. This is a fascinating snapshot of people's lives and it's entertaining as it is.As our narrator tells us at the end, ""sometimes the illusions work better than the medicine.""How many people are doing exactly that in their lives? It's often easier to fool yourself rather than face up to the truth.Video Quality 4/5The Blu-ray presentation of the film isn't something you would choose to show off your home theater, but it looks decent enough. Detail is moderate, but the images are clean and natural-looking. I have seen similar settings in London and felt completely at home.Audio Quality 3.5/5It's rare for a film to feature a DTS-HD Master Audio 3.0 mix, but it works. Sort of. Allen's films tend to focus on dialogue and this track presents it clearly. Where it misses the mark is in scenes featuring background noise. The rear speakers won't enhance the sound of heavy rain or traffic in the way that you would expect. That doesn't detract from the experience too much because of the nature of the film.Special Features 0/5Aside from a trailer and a few promos, there's nothing included apart from the film itself.Would I recommend the film? If, like me, you enjoy Woody Allen's films, this is well worth seeing. Its structure is similar to other Allen films or something like Mike Nichols' Closer (which is superior). Casual viewers might be disappointed as the film deals with the subtleties of human nature. It's interesting rather than thrilling.Overall score 4/5 for Allen fans, 3/5 for those unfamiliar with his work.",4,Sometimes the illusions work better than the medicine,1305590400,"05 17, 2011",2011,4764,"['Will', 'Meet', 'Tall', 'Dark', 'Stranger', 'comedy', 'romance', 'Directed', 'Woody', 'AllenStarring', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'Freida', 'PintoSony', 'Pictures', '|', '2010', '|', '98', 'min', '|', 'Rated', 'R', '|', 'Released', 'Feb', '15', '2011Video', 'Video', 'codec', 'MPEG-4', 'AVCVideo', 'resolution', '1080pAspect', 'ratio', '1.78:1Audio', 'English', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '3.0French', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '3.0Subtitles', 'English', 'English', 'SDH', 'FrenchDisc', 'Single', '25GB', 'Blu-ray', 'DiscWhen', 'watch', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'can', 'expect', 'several', 'things', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'be', 'narrator', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'dialogue-driven', 'cast', 'will', 'be', 'fantastic', 'will', 'be', 'few', 'insights', 'human', 'nature', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'make', 'laugh', 'too', 'honesty', 'writing', 'often', 'lacking', 'similar', 'films.You', 'Will', 'Meet', 'Tall', 'Dark', 'Stranger', 'old', 'married', 'couple', 'younger', 'married', 'couple', 'few', 'single', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'woven', 'mix', 'live', 'London', 'England', 'older', 'couple', 'Helena', 'Jones', 'Alfie', 'Hopkins', 'are', 'separated', 'Helena', 'reacts', 'trying', 'commit', 'suicide', 'Alfie', 'proposing', 'Charmaine', 'woman', 'age.Their', 'daughter', 'Sally', 'Watts', 'relationship', 'parents', 'married', 'Roy', 'Brolin', 'Sally', 'Roy', 'have', 'become', 'bored', 'other', 'are', 'starting', 'notice', 'other', 'people', 'Sally', 'crush', 'boss', 'Greg', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Roy', 'eye', 'attractive', 'neighbor', 'Dia', 'Pinto', '.Helena', 'regularly', 'psychic', 'who', 'life', 'get', 'better', 'will', 'find', 'new', 'love', 'be', 'happy', 'Sally', 'along', 'keep', 'mother', 'happy', 'hopeful.We', 'learn', 'Alfie', 'wife-to-be', 'called', 'Charmaine', 'how', 'met', 'was', 'actually', 'call', 'girl', 'motivation', 'be', 'take', 'Alfie', 'money', 'Roy', 'Dia', 'lunch', 'pursue', 'even', 'when', 'engaged', 'Sally', ""n't"", 'notice', 'Roy', 'behavior', 'too', 'busy', 'spending', 'time', 'Greg.Roy', 'other', 'motivation', 'life', 'finding', 'publisher', 'latest', 'book', 'first', 'was', 'success', 'having', 'trouble', 'selling', 'fourth', 'When', 'tragedy', 'friends', 'Roy', 'true', 'nature', 'clear.The', 'four', 'principal', 'characters', 'are', 'flawed', 'lie', 'routinely', 'protect', 'fragile', 'relationships', 'rarely', 'see', 'true', 'exchange', 'When', 'do', 'outcome', 'usually', 'damaging', 'relationships.Each', 'character', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'willing', 'make', 'big', 'changes', 'order', 'fulfill', 'four', 'suffer', 'setbacks', 'when', 'lies', 'unethical', 'behavior', 'catches', 'up', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'tired', 'boring', 'existence', 'human', 'nature', 'reach', 'something', 'better', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'do', 'so', 'hurting', 'people', 'are', 'supposed', 'love.Allen', 'master', 'exposing', 'weaknesses', 'people', 'have', 'degree', 'actors', 'do', 'material', 'justice', 'would', 'expect', 'nothing', 'less', 'such', 'talented', 'group.The', 'stories', 'subplots', 'held', 'attention', 'found', 'wanting', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'well-defined', 'characters', 'are', 'few', 'twists', 'turns', 'Allen', ""n't"", 'tell', 'character', ""n't"", 'need', 'fascinating', 'snapshot', 'people', 'lives', 'entertaining', 'narrator', 'end', 'sometimes', 'illusions', 'work', 'better', 'medicine', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'doing', 'exactly', 'lives', 'often', 'easier', 'fool', 'rather', 'face', 'truth.Video', 'Quality', '4/5The', 'Blu-ray', 'presentation', 'film', ""n't"", 'something', 'would', 'choose', 'show', 'off', 'home', 'theater', 'decent', 'enough', 'Detail', 'moderate', 'images', 'are', 'clean', 'natural-looking', 'have', 'seen', 'similar', 'settings', 'London', 'felt', 'completely', 'home.Audio', 'Quality', '3.5/5It', 'rare', 'film', 'feature', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '3.0', 'mix', 'Sort', 'Allen', 'films', 'tend', 'focus', 'dialogue', 'track', 'clearly', 'Where', 'mark', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'background', 'noise', 'rear', 'speakers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enhance', 'sound', 'heavy', 'rain', 'traffic', 'way', 'would', 'expect', ""n't"", 'detract', 'experience', 'too', 'much', 'nature', 'film.Special', 'Features', '0/5Aside', 'trailer', 'few', 'promos', 'nothing', 'included', 'apart', 'film', 'itself.Would', 'recommend', 'film', 'enjoy', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'structure', 'similar', 'other', 'Allen', 'films', 'something', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'Closer', 'superior', 'Casual', 'viewers', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'deals', 'subtleties', 'human', 'nature', 'interesting', 'rather', 'thrilling.Overall', 'score', '4/5', 'Allen', 'fans', '3/5', 'unfamiliar', 'work']",N/A

Okay so he made a few attempts to replicate Bergman that worked for some. This newest film - which appears to be a co-production with an Italian company and a British TV network - is a total waste of time. (Okay, red-blooded males will get some visual enjoyment in seeing the amazing body on Lucy Punch, but that's about it!).If you make it to then of the longest 90 minutes I can remember watching a film for, you will hear one character (the mother played by Gemma Jones , who is the only one who is actually happy by the end of the film) talk about a ""book of sound and fury signifying nothing"". Now why couldn't Allen have put that sentence up front? It sums up the plot of the film. The talented cast is totally wasted here. The only one who really appears to be acting is Anthony Hopkins and its in a role that is, frankly, embarrassing for this great actor.If I had to find one thing positive in the film it's the soundtrack - Allen always uses great old jazz records as background music - but that not worth sitting through the film for.Let's just chalk this one for Woody and hope that maybe he'll make a film worth watching next time.As for the DVD, there are NO bonus features except for the trailer and a visual ad for the Soundtrack album.

1364358,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B003UESJCY,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[2, 2]","There are two distinct things in this world, one is a Woody Allen film and the other is the voice of Leon Redbone. And I do like them both. This appears to be an Allen ""trunk film."" It contains multiple themes and characters that have appeared in other Allen films and a few characters he may have discarded. This Allen film doesn't contain the usual protagonist who brings everything into perspective. We are on our own to figure out the various themes.The movie opens with Helena (Gemma Jones) who goes to see a seer and launches a thousand lives. Her name asks the question, ""What would Paris have done with Helena once she was old?"" Helena is in crisis mode. Her seer Cristol (Pauline Collins) has the ability to read people and give good advice. She uses the cards and astrology to advise her clients, and she might be a deeper character than we get to know. Helena comes closest to the Allen protagonist.Helena's husband Alfie (Anthony Hopkins) has left her and has hooked up with with an escort (Lucy Punch) who only wants Alfie's money, something that is apparent to everyone but Alfie. Alfie wants a son to replace his deceased son.Alfie and Helena have a daughter Sally (Naomi Watts) who is married to Roy (Josh Brolin). Roy graduated from medical school, but would rather be a writer. He has written one successful novel...and that appears to be it. He mostly stares out the window at Dia (Freida Pinto) a woman who is engaged. Sally meanwhile works for the charming Greg (Antonio Banderas) who is not getting along with his wife.The ""grass is greener"" theme combines with the ""be careful what you wish for"" theme to give us an interesting film. As the audience we want to know who is going to be happy and who's relationships don't work out. The humor in this film is light with the irony being subtle.

Although billed as a comedy I would say this is more of a drama somewhat akin to the very serious movies Allan produced in the 1980s.  It features a elderly housewife whose husband leaves her for a younger woman (a prostitute in fact) unable to cope with her divorce and her dysfunctional family.  Allan does not bother to try to tie up loose ends as the film concludes leaving you scratching your head and asking what the point really was.  To go into too much detail would provide too many spoilers, and even a stellar cast can't rescue this melancholy offering.  If you like Allan's more dramatic and sad titles, you would probably like this--I was looking for a light movie to watch with my friends on New Years Eve and this doesn't suit the bill.",2,Sad and Open Ended,1358467200,"01 18, 2013",2013,818,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'here', 'billed', 'comedy', 'would', 'say', 'more', 'drama', 'somewhat', 'akin', 'very', 'serious', 'movies', 'Allan', 'produced', '1980s', 'elderly', 'housewife', 'husband', 'younger', 'woman', 'prostitute', 'fact', 'unable', 'cope', 'divorce', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'Allan', 'not', 'bother', 'try', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'film', 'leaving', 'scratching', 'head', 'asking', 'what', 'point', 'really', 'was', 'go', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'would', 'provide', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers', 'even', 'stellar', 'cast', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rescue', 'melancholy', 'offering', 'like', 'Allan', 'more', 'dramatic', 'sad', 'titles', 'would', 'probably', 'was', 'looking', 'light', 'movie', 'watch', 'friends', 'New', 'Years', 'Eve', ""n't"", 'suit', 'bill']",N/A

She steals every scene.Every actor in this movie made you think their characters were real and that's another reason I really liked this movie.

Story about a family who is falling apart...Husband (Hopkins) leaves his wife of 40 years...and that's just the beginning.  The subject matter doesn't seem funny, but it works as a comedy, Woody Allen has a way of doing that.  Husband leaves his wife, who is seeing a psychic, for a woman half his age, daughter has crush on her boss, her husband has crush on the neighbor.  I've never been a Woody Allen fan, I have only really liked a few of his movies.  This one was not that bad.  It was very entertaining and enjoyable, but not one of my favorites.  If you like Woody Allen I'm sure you will really enjoy this.  If you are like me and are not a huge fan, this is still very watchable and a pretty good time.

1364362,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B003UESJCY,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","This is the fourth Woody Allen film set in London, though, unlike ""Midnight in Paris,"" the story could be anywhere. Actually, ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" could be any other Woody Allen film you have seen before, except that it is much less joyful and insightful than his better works.""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" is about two married couples whose marriage is falling apart. Anthony Hopkins plays Alfie, who, after four decades of married life, suddenly realizes that his life will eventually come to an end. Time is running out for him, so what should he do? He thinks he knows the answer when he meets a young call girl named Charmaine (Lucy Punch).""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" follows the consequences of Alfie's action. His wife Helena (Gemma Jones) starts visiting a fortune teller for spiritual advice. Her daughter Sally (Naomi Watts), who is romantically attracted to a handsome art gallery owner Greg (Antonio Banderas), does not stop her mother, while Sally's husband Roy (Josh Brolin), a novelist whose career is waning thinks Helena, is just making a fool of herself. So what will Roy do when he meets a young and beautiful guitar-playing girl Dia (Freida Pinto)?The story is slow-moving and predictable, and when it gets finally interesting, the film is almost over. What is worse, Allen seems unsure of the material he is dealing with. Is this a comedy, a satire or a farce? Should we laugh the ironically named Alfie's longing for youth? As a comedy the film is not very funny; as a drama it is just shallow.""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" is a typical Woody Allen movie with a soft-lighted cinematography, mouth-watering cast (including Ewen Bremner and Anna Friel) and comfortable jazzy soundtrack. The theme is also typical of Allen - fear of death, self-delusion, etc. - something he had done much better elsewhere.",3,Formulaic Woody Allen,1355702400,"12 17, 2012",2012,1864,"['fourth', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'set', 'London', 'though', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'anywhere', 'Actually', 'Will', 'Meet', 'Tall', 'Dark', 'Stranger', 'could', 'be', 'other', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'much', 'less', 'joyful', 'insightful', 'better', 'works', 'Will', 'Meet', 'Tall', 'Dark', 'Stranger', 'about', 'two', 'married', 'couples', 'marriage', 'falling', 'apart', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Alfie', 'who', 'four', 'decades', 'married', 'life', 'suddenly', 'life', 'will', 'eventually', 'come', 'end', 'Time', 'running', 'out', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'answer', 'when', 'young', 'call', 'girl', 'named', 'Charmaine', 'Lucy', 'Punch', 'Will', 'Meet', 'Tall', 'Dark', 'Stranger', 'consequences', 'Alfie', 'action', 'wife', 'Helena', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'visiting', 'fortune', 'teller', 'spiritual', 'advice', 'daughter', 'Sally', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'who', 'romantically', 'attracted', 'handsome', 'art', 'gallery', 'owner', 'Greg', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'not', 'stop', 'mother', 'Sally', 'husband', 'Roy', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'novelist', 'career', 'waning', 'thinks', 'Helena', 'just', 'making', 'fool', 'herself', 'what', 'will', 'Roy', 'do', 'when', 'young', 'beautiful', 'guitar-playing', 'girl', 'Dia', 'Freida', 'Pinto', 'story', 'slow-moving', 'predictable', 'when', 'finally', 'interesting', 'film', 'almost', 'What', 'worse', 'Allen', 'unsure', 'material', 'dealing', 'comedy', 'satire', 'farce', 'Should', 'laugh', 'ironically', 'named', 'Alfie', 'longing', 'youth', 'comedy', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'drama', 'just', 'shallow', 'Will', 'Meet', 'Tall', 'Dark', 'Stranger', 'typical', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'soft-lighted', 'cinematography', 'mouth-watering', 'cast', 'including', 'Ewen', 'Bremner', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'comfortable', 'jazzy', 'soundtrack', 'theme', 'also', 'typical', 'Allen', 'fear', 'death', 'self-delusion', 'etc', 'something', 'had', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'elsewhere']",N/A
