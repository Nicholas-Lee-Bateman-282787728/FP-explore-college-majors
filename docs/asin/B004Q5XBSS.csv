Books have been written, documentaries made, and the spiritual progress of the Waodani people closely followed.  The latest DVD in the journey of the Saint family and those they minister to is The Grandfathers and follows Jesse Saint's experiences among the Waodani as a teenager and adult both in the jungle and at home in North America.Jesse Saint is the son of Steve Saint and the grandson of Nate Saint.  Told through his eyes, viewers are able to see the Waodani progress towards independence and the challenges they face as they begin integrating with the wider world around them.  Jesse's bonds of affection with the men who murdered his grandfather are also explored - the men he now affectionately calls his grandfathers.  It also explores Jesse's lack of direction and focus in his life and his uncertainties surrounding his personal identity (those these are never entirely resolved).Having been captivated by the incredible grace and love presented in The End of the Spear I was eager to watch The Grandfathers.  Apart from some incidental mentions of baptism, the blood of Jesus, asking God what He thinks (once and this was Steve), a spiritual experience following the deaths of Elliot and Saint, and the influence of Christianity on the Waodani (comments made by a college student), there isn't really any direct drawing of attention to the difference Jesus has made in the lives of those portrayed in the documentary.  I have to say that I am very disappointed by this.  With such an opportunity to call attention to the life-changing faith that Jesus gives His followers.While production quality is high, the story line is a bit choppy and jumps around without any real unifying thread.  I think the unifying element that is missing is Jesus.  How does Jesse feel about Jesus today?  How does he feel about the work that Jesus has done amongst the Waodani?  About the forgiveness that Jesus has wrought in their hearts?  It just isn't there.  Instead we are left with some teenage angst with only a smattering of forgiveness thrown in, and that a somewhat vague forgiveness, the heart of the message is missing.",3,Where's Jesus?,1305676800,"05 18, 2011",2011,2326,"['story', 'Nate', 'Saint', 'Jim', 'Elliot', 'martyrdom', 'South', 'America', 'hands', 'Waodani', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'known', 'stories', 'missionary', 'devotion', 'North', 'American', 'church', 'Books', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'documentaries', 'made', 'spiritual', 'progress', 'Waodani', 'people', 'closely', 'followed', 'latest', 'DVD', 'journey', 'Saint', 'family', 'minister', 'Grandfathers', 'Jesse', 'Saint', 'experiences', 'Waodani', 'teenager', 'adult', 'jungle', 'home', 'North', 'America.Jesse', 'Saint', 'son', 'Steve', 'Saint', 'grandson', 'Nate', 'Saint', 'Told', 'eyes', 'viewers', 'are', 'able', 'see', 'Waodani', 'progress', 'towards', 'independence', 'challenges', 'face', 'begin', 'integrating', 'wider', 'world', 'Jesse', 'bonds', 'affection', 'men', 'who', 'murdered', 'grandfather', 'are', 'also', 'explored', 'men', 'now', 'affectionately', 'grandfathers', 'also', 'Jesse', 'lack', 'direction', 'focus', 'life', 'uncertainties', 'surrounding', 'personal', 'identity', 'are', 'never', 'entirely', 'resolved', '.Having', 'been', 'captivated', 'incredible', 'grace', 'love', 'presented', 'End', 'Spear', 'was', 'eager', 'watch', 'Grandfathers', 'Apart', 'incidental', 'mentions', 'baptism', 'blood', 'Jesus', 'asking', 'God', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'Steve', 'spiritual', 'experience', 'following', 'deaths', 'Elliot', 'Saint', 'influence', 'Christianity', 'Waodani', 'comments', 'made', 'college', 'student', ""n't"", 'really', 'direct', 'drawing', 'attention', 'difference', 'Jesus', 'made', 'lives', 'portrayed', 'documentary', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'very', 'disappointed', 'such', 'opportunity', 'call', 'attention', 'life-changing', 'faith', 'Jesus', 'followers.While', 'production', 'quality', 'high', 'story', 'line', 'bit', 'choppy', 'jumps', 'real', 'unifying', 'thread', 'think', 'unifying', 'element', 'missing', 'Jesus', 'How', 'Jesse', 'feel', 'Jesus', 'today', 'How', 'feel', 'work', 'Jesus', 'done', 'Waodani', 'forgiveness', 'Jesus', 'wrought', 'hearts', 'just', ""n't"", 'there', 'Instead', 'are', 'left', 'teenage', 'angst', 'only', 'smattering', 'forgiveness', 'thrown', 'somewhat', 'vague', 'forgiveness', 'heart', 'message', 'missing']",The Grandfathers
1423963,A3EEHMLILVOEMJ,B004Q5XBSS,"L. Hartness ""LHartness""","[0, 0]","Over 50 years ago, a group of young American missionaries flew to Ecuador to share the Gospel with an indigenous tribe, the Auca Indians.  Tragically, these young men were ultimately speared to death by the very people they came to serve.  Among them was Nate Saint, father of Steve Saint and grandfather to Jesse Saint.  ""The Grandfathers"", from EthnoGraphic Media is a film that shares Jesse's experience as the grandson of Nate Saint, now somewhat of a martyred celebrity in Christian circles.Growing up in the shadow of Nate was not the easiest thing for Jesse.  He was frequently introduced as ""Nate Saint's grandson--you know, the missionary who was killed by the Aucas?""  His father Steve had inherited his father's love for missionary work and was known for being somewhat demanding of Jesse as they took trips to serve in the jungle.  There were times when Jesse wanted nothing to do with the life that his father was leading.""The Grandfathers"" chronicles Jesse's journey from a somewhat rebellious youth to a committed Christian family man, following in the footsteps of his heritage.  At less than an hour in length, this autobiographical documentary tells its story briskly and with flair.  Jesse and the producers of the program have done an excellent job in telling this story in an entertaining, respectful and artistic way.  The look of the film is fresh and modern; I didn't want to take my eyes off it.  The story of the Saint family and the Aucas is compelling, tragic and even sometimes humorous.  My only complaint comes in my desire for this production to be longer.The film did not receive a ""G"" rating for its ""thematic material and violent content"".  A couple of quick shots of a spearing victim are seen, although no acts of violence are blatantly shown.  The subject matter of this murderous tribe may not be suitable for very young children, but it's handled very tastefully.  There is also a brief recounting of some girls skinny-dipping in the water, but nothing other than some discarded shirts and jeans are shown.""The Grandfathers"" is the concluding film in the trilogy begun by Beyond the Gates of Splendor (2002) and End of the Spear (2005).  The transformative power of the Gospel is clearly seen in the lives of not only the Auca Indians, but in Jesse's life as well.  I absolutely loved this film and hope that word of mouth allows it to gain a wide audience.  Any church group preparing for a mission trip should watch this, but those struggling with forgiving others would also be touched by the movie's powerful message.  The love and grace of Christ is wide and deep, changing lives and hearts in miraculous ways.  I applaud EthnoGraphic Media and all involved in the creation of ""The Grandfathers"".  They have presented a gift that will touch lives around the world.",5,Excellent Film!,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,2809,"['50', 'years', 'ago', 'group', 'young', 'American', 'missionaries', 'flew', 'Ecuador', 'share', 'Gospel', 'indigenous', 'tribe', 'Auca', 'Indians', 'Tragically', 'young', 'men', 'were', 'ultimately', 'speared', 'death', 'very', 'people', 'came', 'serve', 'was', 'Nate', 'Saint', 'father', 'Steve', 'Saint', 'grandfather', 'Jesse', 'Saint', 'Grandfathers', 'EthnoGraphic', 'Media', 'film', 'shares', 'Jesse', 'experience', 'grandson', 'Nate', 'Saint', 'now', 'somewhat', 'martyred', 'celebrity', 'Christian', 'circles.Growing', 'up', 'shadow', 'Nate', 'was', 'not', 'easiest', 'thing', 'Jesse', 'was', 'frequently', 'introduced', 'Nate', 'Saint', 'grandson', 'know', 'missionary', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'Aucas', 'father', 'Steve', 'had', 'inherited', 'father', 'love', 'missionary', 'work', 'was', 'known', 'being', 'somewhat', 'demanding', 'Jesse', 'took', 'trips', 'serve', 'jungle', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'Jesse', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'do', 'life', 'father', 'was', 'leading', 'Grandfathers', 'Jesse', 'journey', 'somewhat', 'rebellious', 'youth', 'committed', 'Christian', 'family', 'man', 'following', 'footsteps', 'heritage', 'less', 'hour', 'length', 'autobiographical', 'documentary', 'story', 'briskly', 'flair', 'Jesse', 'producers', 'program', 'have', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'entertaining', 'respectful', 'artistic', 'way', 'look', 'film', 'fresh', 'modern', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'take', 'eyes', 'story', 'Saint', 'family', 'Aucas', 'compelling', 'tragic', 'even', 'sometimes', 'humorous', 'only', 'complaint', 'desire', 'production', 'be', 'longer.The', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'G', 'rating', 'thematic', 'material', 'violent', 'content', 'couple', 'quick', 'shots', 'spearing', 'victim', 'are', 'seen', 'acts', 'violence', 'are', 'blatantly', 'shown', 'subject', 'matter', 'murderous', 'tribe', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'suitable', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'handled', 'very', 'tastefully', 'also', 'brief', 'recounting', 'girls', 'skinny-dipping', 'water', 'nothing', 'other', 'discarded', 'shirts', 'jeans', 'are', 'shown', 'Grandfathers', 'concluding', 'film', 'trilogy', 'begun', 'Beyond', 'Gates', 'Splendor', '2002', 'End', 'Spear', '2005', 'transformative', 'power', 'Gospel', 'clearly', 'seen', 'lives', 'not', 'only', 'Auca', 'Indians', 'Jesse', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'film', 'hope', 'word', 'mouth', 'gain', 'wide', 'audience', 'Any', 'church', 'group', 'preparing', 'mission', 'trip', 'should', 'watch', 'struggling', 'forgiving', 'others', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'touched', 'movie', 'powerful', 'message', 'love', 'grace', 'Christ', 'wide', 'deep', 'changing', 'lives', 'hearts', 'miraculous', 'ways', 'applaud', 'EthnoGraphic', 'Media', 'involved', 'creation', 'Grandfathers', 'have', 'presented', 'gift', 'will', 'touch', 'lives', 'world']",The Grandfathers
1423964,ATFRPYKXCCTJX,B004Q5XBSS,"Lollipops ""lollipops5""","[0, 0]","THE GRANDFATHERS is a film about a young man's struggle with his heritage. This DVD completes the triology that includes End of the Spear and Beyond the Gates of Splendor. These films tell the unforgettable and inspiring story of the killing of five missionaries by a stone-age tribe deep in the Amazon jungle. The impact of this tragic event lives on today in families of these slain men as well as among those responsible for their deaths.Steve Saint consulted with Jim Hanon (director) and Matt Green (producer) to help bring the story of Nate to life through the feature End of the Spear and the companion documentary Beyond the Gates of Splendor. These films traced the events leading up to and including the death of these men. But even more than that, they showed the impact the events played on the lives of both their survivors and their killers.When the widows and their children went to live among the Waodani--a tribe regarded as the most violent on earth--the became an integral part of an incredible redemptive journey.THE GRANDFATHERS shows both the burden and benefit of the Saint family's legacy. Jesse Saint, Steve's oldest son and Nate's grandson, was not raised among the tribe. He struggles to find his place under the weight of a famous grandfather he never knew and a heroic father he doesn't understand. This changes when Jesse travels to the jungles of Ecuador with his family and forms a special bond with Micaye--one of the tribesmen who took part in the murder of his grandfather. On then does Jesse come to grips with his family's past and his own destiny.I was raised with the story of these five missionaries. My mother and aunt knew one of the men who went down there and were murdered, and later were shocked when their wives returned there to continue the work the husbands had begun. So this story has always been a part of me. I was interested in hearing Jesse's story, and the film-making really brought this remote area of Ecuador to life. I could see the animals, plants and people  native to the area and their way of life.If you are interested in this continuing story of the five murdered missionaries and the impact it has on the subsequent generations, then you will want to watch THE GRANDFATHERS. This is a family approved film, safe for all ages. As Hanon states: Forgiveness is an awe-inspiring virtue that seems to have been passed on by the Saint family and is shared by many among the Waodani tribe--both demonstrate a profound capacity for forgiveness and healthy self-healing.""

He was murdered by a tribe he was living with in the jungles of the Amazon in Equador. Not only was he murdered but four others he was traveling with, leaving his widow, Rachel behind in the tribe.What happened after that fateful day would change the Amazon tribe forever in events that are told about in the DVD documentary, The Grandfathers.We meet the Saint family as they uproot their lives and move to the jungles of the Amazon rainforest to meet the tribe of people living there, the Waodani,that killed their grandfather but to see just how much their lives are forever changed. The saying ""same hands, yet different hearts"" is the theme throughout as we see just how different it is for both cultures to live within each others worlds and to see God's forgiveness played out in this beautiful film.I received the DVD, The Grandfathers by EGM Films, compliments of B & B Media Group for my honest review. Both my 17 year old daughter and I watched it, often times in amazement, laughter and tears in the 54 minutes. It changed us both and made us realize how different things really are and yet there is wisdom from our grandparents that needs to be listened to and learned from. It makes us not only the people we are today, but able to learn from their ways and grow. I would easily rate this a 5 out of 5 stars for anyone looking to see what a Missionary life is like from a true perspective.This is the third film in the series that chronicles the lives of the five missionary men who died from Mart Green and Jim Hanon, with End of The Spear and Beyond the Gates of Splendor being the first two.

1423966,A112EC059ZZTJF,B004Q5XBSS,Roberto Mattos,"[0, 0]","In 1956 a group of young missionaries was killed by the aucas (or Waodani) tribe in the amazon jungle in Ecuador. They were speared to death by the people they came to serve. One of those missionaries was Nate Saint. His grandchild Jesse Saint, in a very personal and touching narration, tell us his own story. The movie starts with Jesse talking about his family, including his father's sister Rachel, who also lived as  missionary among the same tribe that had killed her brother. When she died, Jesse's father, Steve,  inherited her house, and the indians invited Steve to live among them. So there they went to live in the jungle. He described all the difficulties they faced, with flies in the ""bathroom"", tarantulas etc. He starts developing a friendship with Mincaye, whom after a while he starts calling grandfather. He even tells his tale of killing a deer. Students from a Washington college, participating in an anthropology course, went there to visit them. They were amazed of the reconciliation among all the people there, when they figured out that those among them had killed some of the relatives of the missionaries. The missionaries told that they were the same persons but with different hearts.This film show us in reality what many of us learn in theory but are afraid to apply to our own lives. Making peace with our enemy. This is hard. Forgive those who hurt us so badly. This is even harder. This inspirational film has been awarded The Dove Foundation seal of approval. It completes a trilogy produced by EthnoGraphic Media (EGM) that includes ""End of the Spear"" and ""Beyond the Gates of Splendor"". Although I did not watch neither of the previous movies, it did not felt like the story was missing something.
