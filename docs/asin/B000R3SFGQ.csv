Its all sounds innocent till I asked myself what they actually added to society and obvious answer is nothing. Thats the point--as long as they modify their private parts mainstream media let them play mainstream useful idiots. And in a meantime the number of homeless is the same, crime rate never discussed and anything that may bother status quo never mentioned. Wonderful.Lets borrow another 10 trillion dollars and waste it. Wonderful. The movie itself is boring  and I guess producer should invite Troma team to make from it something like rocking and rolling.",1,subculture goes mainstream and politically correct.,1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,693,"['Modify', 'documentary', 'modifying', 'private', 'parts', 'meet', 'multiple', 'personalities', 'who', 'give', 'reasons', 'experiencies', 'sounds', 'innocent', 'till', 'asked', 'what', 'actually', 'added', 'society', 'obvious', 'answer', 'nothing', 'point', 'as', 'long', 'modify', 'private', 'parts', 'mainstream', 'media', 'let', 'play', 'mainstream', 'useful', 'idiots', 'meantime', 'number', 'homeless', 'same', 'crime', 'rate', 'never', 'discussed', 'anything', 'may', 'bother', 'status', 'quo', 'never', 'mentioned', 'Wonderful.Lets', 'borrow', '10', 'trillion', 'dollars', 'waste', 'Wonderful', 'movie', 'boring', 'guess', 'producer', 'should', 'invite', 'Troma', 'team', 'make', 'something', 'rocking', 'rolling']",Modify-Uncensored Edition

1078836,AJN24TVEGZEI4,B000R3SFGQ,Steve,"[4, 4]","This is a phenominal documentary about body modification as well as the politics, philosophy and people behind it.  This documentary covers plastic surgery, piercing, tattooing, dermal/sub-dermal implants, scarification, branding, sex change/gener reassignment surgery and suspension.  Additionally, the documentary covers the politics behind body modification and many of the psycological aspects as to why people do it.  Many of the interviews are with professional body modifiers, performers, piercers and people who have gone to great lengths to change thier outward appearance.  It also talks about religion, social inclusion and how modifications got their start.Many of the people who they interview may look very odd to the regular person, but when you hear them speak they are so philosophical, and their analysises are so deep and multidimensional.  Living in New York,I am used to seeing tons of people with the wildest body mods imaginable so it is not very shocking for me, but I think this documentary can teach alot of closed minded people about the inner workings of humanity and human desire to change who they are and to become more individualistic.  It also shows the depth and uniquness of human individuality and the human quest for self-acceptance vs social acceptance.One definate warning, this film is VERY VERY graphic.  There is alot of blood and alot of disturbing images as many of the surgeries are shown.  Artists are shown giving people brandings and scarings.  I would say the most disgusting was seeing the process of a tongue splitting.  This documentary is not for the faint of heart and is definately for mature audiances.I absolutely loved this documentary as it held nothing back and truly delved into the realm of real body mod.  I think that this movie would also be a great addition to any psychology, anthropology or sociology class.  This movie definately opens the mind to the extent that people go to, to love and accept themselves regardless of if society accepts them.  It definately shows how people struggle to find happiness and inner peace in ways that are unique and challenges the ideals of religion and society a a whole.A last note... there is a discussion on the difference between modification and mutilation.. phenominal, deep analysis of the topic.BUY THIS NOW!!!",5,Review - Modify,1310947200,"07 18, 2011",2011,2322,"['phenominal', 'documentary', 'body', 'modification', 'as', 'well', 'politics', 'philosophy', 'people', 'documentary', 'covers', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'piercing', 'tattooing', 'dermal/sub-dermal', 'implants', 'scarification', 'branding', 'sex', 'change/gener', 'reassignment', 'surgery', 'suspension', 'Additionally', 'documentary', 'politics', 'body', 'modification', 'many', 'psycological', 'aspects', 'why', 'people', 'do', 'Many', 'interviews', 'are', 'professional', 'body', 'modifiers', 'performers', 'piercers', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'gone', 'great', 'lengths', 'change', 'thier', 'outward', 'appearance', 'also', 'religion', 'social', 'inclusion', 'how', 'modifications', 'got', 'start.Many', 'people', 'who', 'interview', 'may', 'look', 'very', 'odd', 'regular', 'person', 'when', 'hear', 'speak', 'are', 'so', 'philosophical', 'analysises', 'are', 'so', 'deep', 'multidimensional', 'Living', 'New', 'York', 'am', 'used', 'seeing', 'tons', 'people', 'wildest', 'body', 'mods', 'imaginable', 'not', 'very', 'shocking', 'think', 'documentary', 'can', 'teach', 'alot', 'closed', 'minded', 'people', 'inner', 'workings', 'humanity', 'human', 'desire', 'change', 'who', 'are', 'become', 'more', 'individualistic', 'also', 'depth', 'uniquness', 'human', 'individuality', 'human', 'quest', 'self-acceptance', 'vs', 'social', 'acceptance.One', 'definate', 'warning', 'film', 'VERY', 'VERY', 'graphic', 'alot', 'blood', 'alot', 'disturbing', 'images', 'many', 'surgeries', 'are', 'shown', 'Artists', 'are', 'shown', 'giving', 'people', 'brandings', 'scarings', 'would', 'say', 'most', 'disgusting', 'was', 'seeing', 'process', 'tongue', 'splitting', 'documentary', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'definately', 'mature', 'audiances.I', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'documentary', 'held', 'nothing', 'back', 'truly', 'delved', 'realm', 'real', 'body', 'mod', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'great', 'addition', 'psychology', 'anthropology', 'sociology', 'class', 'movie', 'definately', 'mind', 'extent', 'people', 'go', 'love', 'accept', 'regardless', 'society', 'definately', 'how', 'people', 'struggle', 'find', 'happiness', 'inner', 'peace', 'ways', 'are', 'unique', 'ideals', 'religion', 'society', 'whole.A', 'last', 'note', 'discussion', 'difference', 'modification', 'mutilation..', 'phenominal', 'deep', 'analysis', 'topic.BUY', 'THIS', 'NOW']",Modify-Uncensored Edition
1078837,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B000R3SFGQ,stoic,"[1, 2]","It isn't easy to believe but not so long ago a tattoo or an earring (on a man) was considered to be a sign that one was far outside the mainstream. These days, tattoos and earrings raise no eyebrows. It is probably not too surprising to find, therefore, that many people are now looking for more radical forms of body modification.Modify is an interesting look at this trend. Viewers meet a man who has radically altered his appearance so that he looks just like a tiger. There is also extensive discussion of people who like to put metal hooks through their skins so that they can suspend themselves for long periods of time. The film delves into all sorts of body modification and it is seldom boring.Potential viewers should be aware that Modify contains a lot of gore. I don't think that I am squeamish, but I spent large parts of this film looking away from the screen during the many surgery scenes. Also, a few of the ""modified"" people come across as narcissists who have relatively little to say; I was happy when Modify moved on from these people.Modify is a great film for those who want to explore an interesting subculture.
