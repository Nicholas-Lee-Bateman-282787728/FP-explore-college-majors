I admit that I have not seen the fifth or six season but by then most of the storylines start to decline in quality and originality due to the fact that the writers have to keep churning out future episodes for upcoming seasons and fresh ideas, material and new storylines start to wear thin. The writing, the directing, the storylines, the panoramic scenes of the old west as well as the superb acting by the supporting actors has made this the best season. Guest stars who appear on this DVD set as well as appearing on the other seasons, are a staple to the TV western genre, and do a great job as supporting cast. Robert J. Wilke was a great character actor who appeared frequently on the Cheyenne series, sometimes as a villain but other times as a ""good guy."" The price for this collection is not bad considering that it contains 22 episodes, and many of the episodes are as good in quality as many of those 70 to 80 minute black-and-white movie westerns abundant in the 40s and 50s. When I was a boy about seven or eight years of age, I remember watching the ""Monster of the Basin"" episode which I remember was the title of this episode then, but watching this episode almost 50 years later it was probably renamed or the original title was probably the ""Ghost of the Basin."" Those two glaring shining eyes watching at you in the dark surely scared my brother and me! In fact, when I bought this season 2 the first episode that I watched was the ""Ghost of the basin.""

This episode scared the you-know-what out of me when I was a young kid and it still holds up.While it's fun to see well known actors at the starts of their careers, it's great to see the three great villains of western cinema (Jack Elam, Lee van Cleef, and Robert J. Wilke) on this and other Warner Brothers westerns.I hope there isn't another long stretch (like those between the first set and the second) until the next is released.

Sampaio,"[128, 132]","The Cheyenne show is a fabulous trip to the Golden Age of television, to the days when the western genre was simple and pure, when manicheism was well established, good guys versus bad guys. We must urge Warner Bros. to release the second season of Cheyenne as soon as possible. The previous one was released on June 6, 06, so now it is the right time for a new release. The first season of Cheyenne was indeed very good, but the second one is much, much better in all aspects. Season one had only 15 episodes and each ran about 40 minutes each. Season two has 20 episodes running about 50 minutes each. The writing is much better for season two. The famous Cheyenne logo (Cheyenne's bust and the mountainous background)and the familiar theme song by William Lana & Stan Jones, both lacking in the first season, are largely featured starting with season two. The episodes also carry beautiful designs for the initial and final credits.And finally a word about Clint Walker. He is a better actor in this season, proving that he was one of best western stars for television.The second and third seasons of Cheyenne are the outstanding years of the show, a must to everybody that loved the great TV westerns of the 50s and 60s, and also a must to people that never had the opportunity to watch those fantastic and innocent shows of yesterday.The episodes of the second season (1956/57)are as follow:1  - The Dark Rider (guests: Diane Brewster, Myron Healey)2  - The Long Winter3  - Death Deals the Hand (guests: Leo Gordon, Arthur Hunnicut)4  - The Bounty Killer (guest: Andrew Duggan)5  - The Law Man6  - The Mustang Trail (guest: Diane Brewster)7  - Lone Gun (guests: Nancy Hale, Bob Steele)8  - The Trap9  - The Iron Trail (guest: Dennis Hopper)10 - Land Beyond the Law (guest: Andrew Duggan)11 - Test of Courage12 - War Party (guest: Angie Dickinson)13 - Deadline (guest: Ann Robinson)14 - Big Ghost Basin (guest: Merry Anders)15 - Born Bad16 - The Brand (guest: Edward Byrnes)17 - Decision at Gunsight (guests: John Carradine, Marie Windsor)18 - The Spanish Grant (guests: Peggy Castle, Douglas Kennedy)19 - Hard Bargain (guest: Richard Crenna)20 - The Broken Pledge (guest: John Dehner)",5,"Cheyenne Bodie, Tall in the Saddle",1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,2189,"['Cheyenne', 'show', 'fabulous', 'trip', 'Golden', 'Age', 'television', 'days', 'when', 'western', 'genre', 'was', 'simple', 'pure', 'when', 'manicheism', 'was', 'well', 'established', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'must', 'urge', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'release', 'second', 'season', 'Cheyenne', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'previous', 'one', 'was', 'released', 'June', '6', '06', 'so', 'now', 'right', 'time', 'new', 'release', 'first', 'season', 'Cheyenne', 'was', 'indeed', 'very', 'good', 'second', 'one', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'aspects', 'Season', 'one', 'had', 'only', '15', 'episodes', 'ran', '40', 'minutes', 'Season', 'two', '20', 'episodes', 'running', 'about', '50', 'minutes', 'writing', 'much', 'better', 'season', 'two', 'famous', 'Cheyenne', 'logo', 'Cheyenne', 'bust', 'mountainous', 'background', 'familiar', 'theme', 'song', 'William', 'Lana', 'Stan', 'Jones', 'lacking', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'largely', 'featured', 'starting', 'season', 'two', 'episodes', 'also', 'carry', 'beautiful', 'designs', 'initial', 'final', 'credits.And', 'finally', 'word', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'better', 'actor', 'season', 'proving', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'western', 'stars', 'television.The', 'second', 'third', 'seasons', 'Cheyenne', 'are', 'outstanding', 'years', 'show', 'must', 'everybody', 'loved', 'great', 'TV', 'westerns', '50s', '60s', 'also', 'must', 'people', 'never', 'had', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'fantastic', 'innocent', 'shows', 'yesterday.The', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', '1956/57', 'are', 'follow:1', 'Dark', 'Rider', 'guests', 'Diane', 'Brewster', 'Myron', 'Healey', '2', 'Long', 'Winter3', 'Death', 'Hand', 'guests', 'Leo', 'Gordon', 'Arthur', 'Hunnicut', '4', 'Bounty', 'Killer', 'guest', 'Andrew', 'Duggan', '5', 'Law', 'Man6', 'Mustang', 'Trail', 'guest', 'Diane', 'Brewster', '7', 'Lone', 'Gun', 'guests', 'Nancy', 'Hale', 'Bob', 'Steele', '8', 'Trap9', 'Iron', 'Trail', 'guest', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', '10', 'Land', 'Law', 'guest', 'Andrew', 'Duggan', '11', 'Test', 'Courage12', 'War', 'Party', 'guest', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', '13', 'Deadline', 'guest', 'Ann', 'Robinson', '14', 'Big', 'Ghost', 'Basin', 'guest', 'Merry', 'Anders', '15', 'Born', 'Bad16', 'Brand', 'guest', 'Edward', 'Byrnes', '17', 'Decision', 'Gunsight', 'guests', 'John', 'Carradine', 'Marie', 'Windsor', '18', 'Spanish', 'Grant', 'guests', 'Peggy', 'Castle', 'Douglas', 'Kennedy', '19', 'Hard', 'Bargain', 'guest', 'Richard', 'Crenna', '20', 'Broken', 'Pledge', 'guest', 'John', 'Dehner']",Cheyenne: Season 2

The same thing occurred with the first season of Maverick. The episodes are in sharp black and white and seem more carefully made then some of todays TV productions. Clint Walker gives an effective mix of toughness and gentleness and makes an impressive hero. Cheyenne was always my favourite of the Warner Brothers TV westerns and seems just as entertaining today. One particularly unusual episode is &#34;Big Ghost Basin&#34; in which a monstrous beast is at large. It reminded me of the plot of a monster movie, even thought the creature turns out to be conventional. There is a good variety of stories in this second season with Cheyenne in different jobs and settings and of course early appearances from familiar faces such as Dennis Hopper and James Garner.
