In this case, they blamed dancing and rock &amp; roll music. As a result, they outlawed both. For those of us who can't dance a lick or keep a tune to save our lives, this might be a pretty good place to live in. But for Ren (Kevin Bacon), he's just arrived in a town that will always seem like Friday the 13th to him.Ren and his mom have just moved to this small town from the big city of Chicago. Naturally, Ren is a fish out of water here. Everytime there's trouble, people start pointing at him, whether it was his fault or not.But don't feel too bad for Ren. He has made some friends in his High School, but he's also ticked off a few too. And his plan to have a Senior Prom (an event that has not happened in this town for 6 years) is threatening to divide the town in half.Many people will not like this movie for the sole reason of the 80s music and dance. But there is a story behind the music, one that was brilliantly told. I have seen this movie many, many times, and each time I watch it I catch something that I had missed before. This was not a teen movie made for the sole purpose of cashing in on the teen movie craze at the time. It has a message worth listening to.Unfortunatley, the DVD is lacking in extras. Of course, this movie was made back when DVDs were nothing more than an idea in somebody's head.

212445,APP5MBH2BSX6I,6300214370,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[5, 6]","...you can have a copy of this film that defined a generation.  Well, okay, maybe not quite DEFINED, but Kevin Bacon's ""Footloose"" was and is a pop culture milestone of sorts, and even launched a wave of similar films of varying merit.  ""Footloose"" is earnest, yet fun.The story involves a big city kid who has to move to a smallish town in Oklahoma/Texas/wherever, a town that's so far removed from his big city ways that it views him with suspicion.  Yep, things used to be that way, and still are in some places.  Bacon plays the new kid quite well for someone well out of his teens (ain't that show biz), and the character is drawn as one who's not a bad guy but just misunderstood.  Kinda James Dean Lite.The plot tension involves rock'n'roll and dancing.  Both are very much frowned upon in this town on the buckle of the Bible Belt.  These days many may wonder why that was the case, and indeed it was back in the early 1980s and previous.  Parents feared several things about dancing to rock'n'roll, such as the fact that drinking and dope often accompanies such events (see RAVE) and the suspicion that healthy young people will often be sexually excited by seeing each other shake their booties, leading to unplanned babies and all of the attendant problems thereto.Understandable parental concerns, of course.  But Ren, the new kid, eventually wins over the town because he's a good guy and he turns the kids his way, causing a somewhat good-natured rebellion that still has its tense moments.  John Lithgow is excellent here as the old-fashioned preacher with a personal ax to grind regarding this subject, and after the necessary confrontations have moved the story along, we have a nice happy ending with a Hollywood musical feel to it.OK, so the film is far better than my description of it.  And it certainly is dated in some ways, but that's part of why this film is noteworthy.  In the early '80s it was just becoming acceptable for a movie to present youth culture as a stylish snapshot of itself.  Prior to this, such films were mostly renegade productions or judgemental/cautionary tales of said youth culture.  ""Footloose"" was in the first wave of films that celebrated the culture of youth in a positive way, and while the clothes, hairstyles, and music now look and sound like relics from a Museum Of Past Coolness, it deserves a place in history for that.It was also one of the first films to produce a soundtrack album designed as a marketing tie-in, with multiple hit songs by various popular artists created especially for the project, including Kenny Loggins's title track, Deneice Williams's ""Let's Hear it For the Boy,"" Bonnie Tyler's ""Holding Out For a Hero,"" and ""Almost Paradise,"" a vapid rock ballad sung by the lead vocalists from Heart and Loverboy, as well as a few other cuts that had already been popular.Beyond that, it's a feel-good film that pulls all the typical Hollywood Movie Strings and pushes all your buttons like a good manipulative Major Motion Picture should.  It works.  Naw, it's no major work of art, but a pop culture phenomenon that won't be forgotten anytime soon.",4,For the prize of a pizza...,1097193600,"10 8, 2004",2004,3123,"['can', 'have', 'copy', 'film', 'defined', 'generation', 'Well', 'okay', 'maybe', 'not', 'quite', 'DEFINED', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Footloose', 'was', 'pop', 'culture', 'milestone', 'sorts', 'even', 'launched', 'wave', 'similar', 'films', 'varying', 'merit', 'Footloose', 'earnest', 'yet', 'fun.The', 'story', 'big', 'city', 'kid', 'who', 'move', 'smallish', 'town', 'Oklahoma/Texas/wherever', 'town', 'so', 'far', 'removed', 'big', 'city', 'ways', 'suspicion', 'Yep', 'things', 'used', 'be', 'way', 'still', 'are', 'places', 'Bacon', 'new', 'kid', 'quite', 'well', 'someone', 'well', 'teens', 'ai', ""n't"", 'show', 'biz', 'character', 'drawn', 'one', 'who', 'not', 'bad', 'guy', 'just', 'misunderstood', 'Kinda', 'James', 'Dean', 'Lite.The', 'plot', 'tension', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'dancing', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'frowned', 'town', 'buckle', 'Bible', 'Belt', 'days', 'many', 'may', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'case', 'indeed', 'was', 'back', 'early', '1980s', 'previous', 'Parents', 'feared', 'several', 'things', 'dancing', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'such', 'fact', 'drinking', 'dope', 'often', 'such', 'events', 'see', 'RAVE', 'suspicion', 'healthy', 'young', 'people', 'will', 'often', 'be', 'sexually', 'excited', 'seeing', 'other', 'shake', 'booties', 'leading', 'unplanned', 'babies', 'attendant', 'problems', 'thereto.Understandable', 'parental', 'concerns', 'course', 'Ren', 'new', 'kid', 'eventually', 'town', 'good', 'guy', 'kids', 'way', 'causing', 'somewhat', 'good-natured', 'rebellion', 'still', 'tense', 'moments', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'excellent', 'here', 'old-fashioned', 'preacher', 'personal', 'ax', 'grind', 'regarding', 'subject', 'necessary', 'confrontations', 'have', 'moved', 'story', 'along', 'have', 'nice', 'happy', 'ending', 'Hollywood', 'musical', 'feel', 'it.OK', 'film', 'far', 'better', 'description', 'certainly', 'dated', 'ways', 'part', 'why', 'film', 'noteworthy', 'early', 'was', 'just', 'becoming', 'acceptable', 'movie', 'present', 'youth', 'culture', 'stylish', 'snapshot', 'Prior', 'such', 'films', 'were', 'mostly', 'renegade', 'productions', 'judgemental/cautionary', 'tales', 'said', 'youth', 'culture', 'Footloose', 'was', 'first', 'wave', 'films', 'celebrated', 'culture', 'youth', 'positive', 'way', 'clothes', 'hairstyles', 'music', 'now', 'look', 'sound', 'relics', 'Museum', 'Past', 'Coolness', 'place', 'history', 'that.It', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'first', 'films', 'produce', 'soundtrack', 'album', 'designed', 'marketing', 'tie-in', 'multiple', 'hit', 'songs', 'various', 'popular', 'artists', 'created', 'especially', 'project', 'including', 'Kenny', 'Loggins', 'title', 'track', 'Deneice', 'Williams', 'Let', 'Hear', 'Boy', 'Bonnie', 'Tyler', 'Holding', 'Out', 'Hero', 'Almost', 'Paradise', 'vapid', 'rock', 'ballad', 'sung', 'lead', 'vocalists', 'Heart', 'Loverboy', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'other', 'cuts', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'popular.Beyond', 'feel-good', 'film', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'Movie', 'Strings', 'pushes', 'buttons', 'good', 'manipulative', 'Major', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'should', 'Naw', 'major', 'work', 'art', 'pop', 'culture', 'phenomenon', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'forgotten', 'anytime', 'soon']",N/A

212447,A2AVH5HXH2TYWA,6300214370,CADJewellerySkills,"[5, 6]","From looking at Kevin Bacon's later career, you'd never imagine he could really dance. But he did indeed do most of the dancing in this movie (everything but the gymnastics). Perhaps moreso even than Flashdance, this movie highlighted the mid-80's period when contemporary dance was at its hottest. The cinematography for the choreography was certainly more coherent and easier to follow than Flashdance.What also sets this apart from other dance movies was the quality of the plot. As simple the small town teen rebellion plot may seem, compare this to the cliches or drudgery of later dance movies. It also helped that many of the big name actors in this movie brought their best performances. This was the movie which really kick-started Kevin Bacon's career (and made him a teen heartthrob for a couple of years). But John Lithgow's emotional journey and eventual change of heart carries the movie as much as the dance sequences do.By setting the entire movie in a small town in Utah (Lehi, to be exact. Many of the landmarks in the movie actually exist and still stand today.), it helped give the movie's conservative setting a more believable feel.One can't talk about Footloose without mentioning the soundtrack.There isn't a child of the 80's who doesn't know that uplifting and catchy titular track. Many people forget that Kenny Loggins was considered a folk/hippie rocker before this soundtrack came out (he was half of the band Loggins and Messina).

212452,AGOTQ7VEQ5IML,6300214370,"cdkscully ""cdkscully""","[7, 11]","Devised as a lengthened music video, Footloose was a film filled with catchy music, good-looking stars and a story that emphasized the relationship between the Hollywood movie and pop music. The story is about a teen from Chicago named Ren (Kevin Bacon) who moves to a small town in the Midwest and just wants to be accepted by the residents. Not long after moving there, he realizes that the religious congregation and the residents have outlawed dancing and rock music because of the evils that are associated with it. His quest, through the duration of the movie is to make dancing and rock music legal again and to hold a school dance for himself and the seniors of his high school. He has a lot of big city hangs ups to overcome as he tries to fit in to small town life. Ultimately he accomplishes what he set out to do and arranges to have the dance, but across the county line in another town.This type of musical began with 'Saturday Night Fever' and continued the love of the Hollywood movie with a pop music soundtrack. It was not a musical typical to those of the '30s, '40s and '50s where the actors sang the songs, but rather referred to the actions of what was going on in the scene. Because of this, the film used diegetic sound, a term for saying that the film shows where the source of the music is coming from. There is always a radio or boom box present to add music to the scene and pinpoint the location of the music. For example, in one scene where Ren and Ariel's (Lori Singer) bully boyfriend Chuck (Jim Youngs) are having a tractor &quot;chicken&quot; contest (where one tractor races towards the other and the one who pulls out first is the chicken). Before the race starts, Chuck turns on the tape in the boom box and the song &quot;Holding Out for a Hero&quot; by Bonnie Tyler plays. It appeared that this contest was set up to see who would be her &quot;hero.&quot; The song &quot;Dancing in the Sheets&quot; by Shalamar is coming from a boom box that Ariel and her boyfriend brought to a fast food drive-in. Everybody, taken by the beat of the song, begins to dance around. The finale was a big production number (if it could be called one) where their dream of dancing finally becomes a reality and at this time, the title song &quot;Footloose&quot; by Kenny Loggins was playing. Another type of sound used in this movie is nondiegetic where music is used to convey a mood or theme without showing where the source of the music is coming from. An example of this is the song &quot;I'm Free&quot; by Kenny Loggins where it is decided that the seniors of the high school can have the dance. The song begins faintly when the board is voicing their opinion that it is all right to have the dance. The most annoying aspects of this music is that every song was written by the screenwriter of the movie, Dean Pitchford in collaboration with some of the popular singer/composers of that time such as Eric Carmen, Kenny Loggins, Sammy Hagar etc. and all but the title song &quot;Footloose&quot; were written after the completion of the movie. &quot;Mr. Pitchford on all the songs has given the score a more consistent tone than the typical soundtrack potpourri. The music is also a text book example of how Hollywood adapts the latest pop trends and technological developments to its own uses.&quot; (The New York Times March 4, 1984)Footloose was marketed so heavily on MTV with its music videos that everyone who saw the videos ran out to see the movie. It wasn't a particularly good movie, but people liked the music. In actuality, it was the musical numbers that sold the movie. I enjoyed the music videos that I saw on MTV that promoted the movie Footloose. However, I did not actually see the movie until it came on cable a year later. The movie was a typical teenage plot with little or no substance, but was done in a way that appealed to children and adults. &quot;Herb Ross brings to Footloose an adult sensibility often lacking in troubled teen pics, resulting in a film that could play off across a broad market place.&quot; (Variety February 15, 1984)",4,Holding Out for a Hero...,1015718400,"03 10, 2002",2002,4087,"['Devised', 'lengthened', 'music', 'video', 'Footloose', 'was', 'film', 'filled', 'catchy', 'music', 'good-looking', 'stars', 'story', 'emphasized', 'relationship', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'pop', 'music', 'story', 'teen', 'Chicago', 'named', 'Ren', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'who', 'small', 'town', 'Midwest', 'just', 'be', 'accepted', 'residents', 'Not', 'long', 'moving', 'there', 'religious', 'congregation', 'residents', 'have', 'outlawed', 'dancing', 'rock', 'music', 'evils', 'are', 'associated', 'quest', 'duration', 'movie', 'make', 'dancing', 'rock', 'music', 'legal', 'again', 'hold', 'school', 'dance', 'seniors', 'high', 'school', 'lot', 'big', 'city', 'hangs', 'ups', 'overcome', 'fit', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'Ultimately', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'arranges', 'have', 'dance', 'county', 'line', 'town.This', 'type', 'musical', 'began', ""'Saturday"", 'Night', 'Fever', 'continued', 'love', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'pop', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'not', 'musical', 'typical', ""'30s"", ""'40s"", ""'50s"", 'where', 'actors', 'sang', 'songs', 'rather', 'referred', 'actions', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'scene', 'film', 'used', 'diegetic', 'sound', 'term', 'saying', 'film', 'where', 'source', 'music', 'coming', 'always', 'radio', 'boom', 'box', 'present', 'add', 'music', 'scene', 'pinpoint', 'location', 'music', 'example', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Ren', 'Ariel', 'Lori', 'Singer', 'bully', 'boyfriend', 'Chuck', 'Jim', 'Youngs', 'are', 'having', 'tractor', 'quot', 'chicken', 'quot', 'contest', 'where', 'one', 'tractor', 'other', 'one', 'who', 'out', 'first', 'chicken', 'race', 'Chuck', 'tape', 'boom', 'box', 'song', 'quot', 'Holding', 'Out', 'Hero', 'quot', 'Bonnie', 'Tyler', 'appeared', 'contest', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'see', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'quot', 'quot', 'song', 'quot', 'Dancing', 'Sheets', 'quot', 'Shalamar', 'coming', 'boom', 'box', 'Ariel', 'boyfriend', 'brought', 'fast', 'food', 'drive-in', 'Everybody', 'taken', 'beat', 'song', 'dance', 'around', 'finale', 'was', 'big', 'production', 'number', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'one', 'where', 'dream', 'dancing', 'finally', 'reality', 'time', 'title', 'song', 'quot', 'Footloose', 'quot', 'Kenny', 'Loggins', 'was', 'playing', 'type', 'sound', 'used', 'movie', 'nondiegetic', 'where', 'music', 'used', 'convey', 'mood', 'theme', 'showing', 'where', 'source', 'music', 'coming', 'example', 'song', 'quot', ""'m"", 'Free', 'quot', 'Kenny', 'Loggins', 'where', 'decided', 'seniors', 'high', 'school', 'can', 'have', 'dance', 'song', 'faintly', 'when', 'board', 'voicing', 'opinion', 'all', 'right', 'have', 'dance', 'most', 'annoying', 'aspects', 'music', 'song', 'was', 'written', 'screenwriter', 'movie', 'Dean', 'Pitchford', 'collaboration', 'popular', 'singer/composers', 'time', 'such', 'Eric', 'Carmen', 'Kenny', 'Loggins', 'Sammy', 'Hagar', 'etc', 'title', 'song', 'quot', 'Footloose', 'quot', 'were', 'written', 'completion', 'movie', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'Pitchford', 'songs', 'given', 'score', 'more', 'consistent', 'tone', 'typical', 'soundtrack', 'potpourri', 'music', 'also', 'text', 'book', 'example', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'latest', 'pop', 'trends', 'technological', 'developments', 'own', 'uses.', 'quot', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'March', '4', '1984', 'Footloose', 'was', 'marketed', 'so', 'heavily', 'MTV', 'music', 'videos', 'everyone', 'who', 'saw', 'videos', 'ran', 'out', 'see', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'good', 'movie', 'people', 'liked', 'music', 'actuality', 'was', 'musical', 'numbers', 'sold', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'videos', 'saw', 'MTV', 'promoted', 'movie', 'Footloose', 'However', 'did', 'not', 'actually', 'see', 'movie', 'came', 'cable', 'year', 'later', 'movie', 'was', 'typical', 'teenage', 'plot', 'little', 'substance', 'was', 'done', 'way', 'appealed', 'children', 'adults', 'quot', 'Herb', 'Ross', 'Footloose', 'adult', 'sensibility', 'often', 'lacking', 'troubled', 'teen', 'pics', 'resulting', 'film', 'could', 'play', 'off', 'broad', 'market', 'place.', 'quot', 'Variety', 'February', '15', '1984']",N/A

Streetsmart but gentle teenager Ren MacCormack(Kevin Bacon) arrives from the big city with his mother in the backwater town of Bomont. Enrolling at the local high school, he is appalled to discover the town's adults have imposed a law on ""public dancing"" and rock music, as enforced and practiced by the local preacher(John Lithgow). Ren quickly sets about changing things, falling in love with the preacher's daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) in the process.The story is a little unlikely yet it is perfectly suitable for the teenaged audience at which it is pitched. The script takes some time to explore its simple theme - dancing and rock music, and what they symbolise for young people. Three scenes help to lay this out. The first sees Ren dancing by himself in a barn; the town meeting where Ren presents his case to the townspeople and explains to them the meaning of the dance; and the final prom sequence in which the teens of Bomont revel in their newfound liberation.As the leading man, Kevin Bacon carries off his role very well. Ren isn't really a macho hero revelling in coolness, he's a down-to-earth young man trying to the right thing by his peers. His romance with Lori Singer's character Ariel is formulaic but perfectly inoffensive.The film could have perhaps done with a little more nastiness to fully contrast against Ren's earnest intentions. Even Ariel's brutish boyfriend(Jim Young) fails to inject much tension in this respect and the final fistfight between him and Ren comes across as being a bit lame.John Lithgow's characterisation is very good but it is a little too subtle. As the town Reverend and preacher of all things pure and holy, his extreme views come across not so much as puritanical, just merely uptight. The change that eventually occurs in his attitudes is hinted at very early on. The result is that he is nowhere near is frightening or intimidating a character as he could have been. At the same time his troubled relationships with his rebellious daughter and quiet wife(Dianne Wiest) are very well written and acted. In these scenes he excels and his character's development seems very natural.On the technical side, the film is well-shot and the gloriously Eighties soundtrack complements the proceedings very well, bringing the necessary exhuberance and bounce to the whole movie.Whilst ""Footloose"" is certainly no masterpiece, it succeeds in being a lighthearted knockabout caper, and as such is a very enjoyable movie.",4,One of my favorites,1207612800,"04 8, 2008",2008,2609,"['Footloose', 'fun', 'very', 'lighthearted', 'motion', 'picture', 'good', 'time', 'delivers.The', 'film', 'simple', 'unlikely', 'plotline', 'Streetsmart', 'gentle', 'teenager', 'Ren', 'MacCormack', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'big', 'city', 'mother', 'backwater', 'town', 'Bomont', 'Enrolling', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'appalled', 'discover', 'town', 'adults', 'have', 'imposed', 'law', 'public', 'dancing', 'rock', 'music', 'enforced', 'practiced', 'local', 'preacher', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Ren', 'quickly', 'sets', 'changing', 'things', 'falling', 'love', 'preacher', 'daughter', 'Ariel', 'Lori', 'Singer', 'process.The', 'story', 'little', 'unlikely', 'perfectly', 'suitable', 'teenaged', 'audience', 'pitched', 'script', 'time', 'explore', 'simple', 'theme', 'dancing', 'rock', 'music', 'what', 'symbolise', 'young', 'people', 'Three', 'scenes', 'help', 'lay', 'out', 'first', 'Ren', 'dancing', 'barn', 'town', 'meeting', 'where', 'Ren', 'case', 'townspeople', 'meaning', 'dance', 'final', 'prom', 'sequence', 'teens', 'Bomont', 'revel', 'newfound', 'leading', 'man', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'role', 'very', 'well', 'Ren', ""n't"", 'really', 'macho', 'hero', 'revelling', 'coolness', 'down-to-earth', 'young', 'man', 'trying', 'right', 'thing', 'peers', 'romance', 'Lori', 'Singer', 'character', 'Ariel', 'formulaic', 'perfectly', 'inoffensive.The', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'perhaps', 'done', 'little', 'more', 'nastiness', 'fully', 'contrast', 'Ren', 'earnest', 'intentions', 'Even', 'Ariel', 'brutish', 'boyfriend', 'Jim', 'Young', 'inject', 'much', 'tension', 'respect', 'final', 'fistfight', 'Ren', 'across', 'being', 'bit', 'lame.John', 'Lithgow', 'characterisation', 'very', 'good', 'little', 'too', 'subtle', 'town', 'Reverend', 'preacher', 'things', 'pure', 'holy', 'extreme', 'views', 'come', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'puritanical', 'just', 'merely', 'uptight', 'change', 'eventually', 'attitudes', 'hinted', 'very', 'early', 'result', 'nowhere', 'near', 'frightening', 'intimidating', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'time', 'troubled', 'relationships', 'rebellious', 'daughter', 'quiet', 'wife', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'scenes', 'character', 'development', 'very', 'natural.On', 'technical', 'side', 'film', 'well-shot', 'gloriously', 'Eighties', 'soundtrack', 'proceedings', 'very', 'well', 'bringing', 'necessary', 'exhuberance', 'bounce', 'whole', 'movie.Whilst', 'Footloose', 'certainly', 'masterpiece', 'being', 'lighthearted', 'knockabout', 'caper', 'such', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie']",N/A

212465,ADS5APY1NKTL4,6300214370,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[9, 11]","This film is an example of early-1980s films at their best.  FOOTLOOSE stars a young Kevin Bacon as Ren McCormick, a teenager from Chicago, who relocates to a small, bible thumping town with his mother, when his father walks out on the family.  This is a town where rock and roll and dancing are illegal--a law enforced by the local reverand (John Lithgow).  Ren is determined to challenge this law, and bring dance back to the community.  He gets some help from Willard (Chris Penn) and the reverand's rebellious teenage daughter, Ariel (Lori Singer).Yes, people, this really is an example of when 1980s films (and dance movies, for that matter) go refreshingly right.  Kevin Bacon is simply exhuberant and glowing as Ren.  The best sequences are when we see Kevin cut loose and dance up a storm.  One of the greatest scenes that lingers in my mind (and the minds of many) is when Ren teaches Willard how dance to ""Let's Hear It For the Boy"" by Deniece Williams (one of the catchiest and most joyous dance songs from that time).  The cast is great here, and it's really a trip to see the (usually) comedic John Lithgow play straight man, as the buttoned down preacher.  This film truly sucks you in from the opening credits with shots of dancing feet (yes, feet in flashy 1980s pumps, ratty old sneakers and someone wearing leg warmers) and doesn't let go until the final dance number at the end.  A lot of fun.....",5,a great and entertaining film.......,1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,1416,"['film', 'example', 'early-1980s', 'films', 'best', 'FOOTLOOSE', 'young', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Ren', 'McCormick', 'teenager', 'Chicago', 'who', 'small', 'bible', 'thumping', 'town', 'mother', 'when', 'father', 'out', 'family', 'town', 'where', 'rock', 'roll', 'dancing', 'are', 'illegal', 'law', 'enforced', 'local', 'reverand', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Ren', 'determined', 'challenge', 'law', 'bring', 'dance', 'back', 'community', 'help', 'Willard', 'Chris', 'Penn', 'reverand', 'rebellious', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Ariel', 'Lori', 'Singer', '.Yes', 'people', 'really', 'example', 'when', '1980s', 'films', 'dance', 'movies', 'matter', 'go', 'refreshingly', 'right', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'simply', 'exhuberant', 'glowing', 'Ren', 'best', 'sequences', 'are', 'when', 'see', 'Kevin', 'cut', 'loose', 'dance', 'up', 'storm', 'One', 'greatest', 'scenes', 'lingers', 'mind', 'minds', 'many', 'when', 'Ren', 'Willard', 'how', 'dance', 'Let', 'Hear', 'Boy', 'Deniece', 'Williams', 'one', 'catchiest', 'most', 'joyous', 'dance', 'songs', 'time', 'cast', 'great', 'here', 'really', 'trip', 'see', 'usually', 'comedic', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'play', 'straight', 'man', 'buttoned', 'down', 'preacher', 'film', 'truly', 'opening', 'credits', 'shots', 'dancing', 'feet', 'yes', 'feet', 'flashy', '1980s', 'pumps', 'ratty', 'old', 'sneakers', 'someone', 'wearing', 'leg', 'warmers', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'final', 'dance', 'number', 'end', 'lot', 'fun', '..']",N/A
212466,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,6300214370,Duane Thomas,"[4, 5]","Footloose is viewed with immense affection both by those who remember its original release and new fans alike. It actually deserves that high regard. On the surface, it would be easy to dismiss Footloose as ""just another teen movie"": Chicago teen Ren MacCormack (Kevin Bacon in his starmaker role) relocates to small-town Bomont (actually filmed in Provo, Utah). There he finds himself in conflict against a town ordnance forbidding public dancing, primarily in the person of Bomont's Baptist minister (John Lithgow). In the process, Ren romances the minister's daughter Ariel (Lori Singer), engages in a Rebel Without a Cause game of chicken with tractors instead of hotrods, and orchestrates the first high school dance Bomont's seen in years, along the way taking part in some pretty freakin' incredible dance numbers.Not exactly Citizen Kane material, but elevating Footloose above what it might have been is (a) Dean Pitchford's script never condescends to the characters, (b) all the main characters are portrayed by talented actors investing them with believability and dignity, and (c) wonderful choreography.Footloose came out just after MTV started up, and it was the right film at the right time, a very early instance of the symbiotic relationship between MTV and movies. To promote Footloose, use of MTV was key. Well before its theatrical release, songs from the soundtrack, the two biggies being Kenny Loggins' ""Footloose"" (of course) and Deniece Williams' ""Let's Hear It For the Boy"" were cut as videos for MTV. This was one of the first times anyone ever used the idea of a soundtrack, and THE first time they used MTV videos of music from same, to really push a movie into being a major hit. It worked like gangbusters. The soundtrack put six songs into the Top Forty. By the time Footloose hit theaters there was already a nationwide awareness of it, of its music and dance scenes. Immense numbers of people wanted to see the film, and were already disposed to like it, because they loved the soundtrack and videos.20-plus years later, Kevin Bacon's portrayal of Ren MacCormack is still the role with which he's most identified. Strangely enough, Paramount did not want him in the part. At this point in his career, Bacon was regarded as a character actor, best-known for playing Fenwick in Diner, a very quirky, unhappy young man. So the studio's view of Kevin Bacon was, ""Yeah, great actor, but for supporting character roles, not possessed of the charisma of a leading man."" (Boy, were they wrong.) Veteran director Herbert Ross was already attached to the project, and he believed in Kevin Bacon. That carried weight because Ross was very well-established, had already directed many, many actors to Academy Award winning performances, and said, ""If Kevin Bacon doesn't get this role I'm walking off the film."" Given how things turned out, Ross had to feel incredibly vindicated when Footloose was a smash hit, and because of it Kevin Bacon became a star.As good as Kevin is as Ren, I have to single out John Lithgow as the Reverend Shaw Moore, Ariel's father and head of the anti-dancing fraternity, for special mention. It would have been so easy for the writer and director, and Lithgow, to portray Moore as the villain of the piece, a caricature, a stereotype, the narrow-minded, Bible thumbing, overbearing Baptist minister. Instead he's really the beating heart of the movie, a kind, decent man whose son died in a car crash several years before, and as a result he's become extremely protective and over-controlling of his daughter's life. This is something people can understand as a very human reaction, motivated by love even if it expresses itself badly. Lithgow's portrayal of Rev. Moore and the story of his troubled relationship with his daughter gave Footloose its crossover appeal, turning it from ""just another teen movie"" into something adults could watch and enjoy, as well.Diane Wiest is excellent in the small but crucial role of Vi Moore, the Reverend's wife. Chris Penn is just amazingly good as Ren's new friend, Willard Hewitt. Some of the most indelible imagery in Footloose, what comes to mind first whenever I think of it, are the scenes where sophisticated, worldly-wise Ren takes awkward, small town Willand and teaches him to dance. Lori Singer is great as Ariel, the wild child who's sexy, angry, and sweet by turns. Really there are no slackers in this movie, every major role is filled by actors who totally inhabit their characters.Not to put more weight on this piece of mass market entertainment than perhaps it can support, but at its heart Footloose does ask the question ""What is moral behavior?"" Is it unswerving adherence to a preset code of conduct, or do we have a moral responsibility to judge the status quo, and if our sense of morality says we must, rise up against it? Footloose is about people, in a small way, on a grass roots, real world level, fighting against oppression, a sort of spiritual/intellectual lockstep mentality.So that's Footloose. A film that, once you start digging into it, is really one hell of a lot more than ""just another teen movie."" But in the course of doing all that impressive stuff, it never forgets how to entertain and have fun. The DVD has superb extras, including the original trailer; commentary tracks by Kevin Bacon, producer Craig Zadan and writer Dean Pitchford; and three ""making of"" featurettes. I would have liked to see the videos for ""Footloose"" and ""Let's Hear It For the Boy"" and the Kevin Bacon audition tape ""cut like a rock video"" mentioned in one of the featurettes (assuming it still exists) included as extras. Oh well, maybe in a future special edition. For now, Footloose is definitely a movie worth owning on DVD.",5,Captures the Heart and Soul of the MTV Generation,1122076800,"07 23, 2005",2005,5740,"['Footloose', 'viewed', 'immense', 'affection',

212473,A1XGPPFDFUVW25,6300214370,Eric Moore,"[1, 4]","I remember growing up with this movie in Jr. High. The soundtrack was introduced to me before I saw the movie. I loved every song on the soundtrack except for ""The Girl Gets Around"".  I mean it is ok. I also remember seeing the play a few years ago here in Dallas. It explained more detail on the preacher's wife, and Ren's mother. The trials they are going through and more thoughts about their husbands. They have a song they sing together about having inner feelings not to be shared. The preacher's wife staying so humble to her husband all through the years, and Ren's mom feeling trapped as well.The movie was based on a true story. The producers/writers etc. went to small towns in Oklahoma. They attended their churches and listend to converstaions of the town. They found out becasue of some religous belief, that dancing was not allowed. So that is pretty much where the idea came to be about making a story/movie about that situation. Unfortunatly, religion plays a big part in a lot of places. I was glad to see that the kids in this movie stood up for their right to dance. Even if it was thought that dancing could lead to drugs/sex/violance etc. Religon can point out it can be sin or it could lead to STD's, Aids, pregnancy etc. As adults, we are responsible for our own actions. The point that Ren was making, there is a time for EVERYTHING under heven. The teens were not going to have a dance thinking it would lead to SEX/Violance/drugs etc. They were old enough to know what is right and what is wrong. It is so much a shame that we the people listen to the big churches and letting them ""control"" people's lives.I agree that the transfer could be better, and that the sound is pretty lame.  However the film shines through all that.  Paromount can be lazy in the restoring/extras dept. I had the first virson and then traded it in for this version.

Gross,"[0, 0]","This is that movie you just have to watch to remind yourself that freedom is alive in the world.Kevin Bacon plays the part of Ren, and he does a goooood job at it.  Ren is a liberal, upbeat, pop-infested teen from Chicago who moves out to the bible belt with a step-family.  In the town, dancing is illegal due to influence from the Religious Right.  But Kev--I mean Ren, is determined to win the youth back their freedom.  He teaches them what the wonder of dancing is all about.This is the movie for those of you who can't find a place to dance, especially in the modern America where all nightlife is closed off to teenagers and young adults.  It will make you reminisce of a more permissive time when teenagers were treated with freedom and expected to pay back with responsibility.  It also shows the pickle a community can get in when it passes too many laws ""for your own good.""  We are more and more living in a society where the youth are losing their civil liberties, and I truly believe repression is at least partly to blame for all the acts of violence and angst in today's teen populace.Watch this movie and I hope you will be convinced of the need to keep teens free from too many lifestyle restrictions.

212512,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6300214370,Martin Asiner,"[2, 3]","Hollywood's love affair for dance and music movies has continued unabated ever since Fred and Ginger waltzed their way across the screen in the 1930s. In FOOTLOOSE, director Herbert Ross has successfully melded several movies in one: teen filled angst against society, dancing as a way of life, and the fitting in of a loner. Kevin Bacon is immensely appealing with his boyish good looks and bouncing feet as Ren, a teen who has moved with his family from the big city to the small town. In the past, Hollywood has usually portrayed the small town citizens as closed-minded hicks who somehow fear that the city slicker in their midst will expose their hollowness for all to see. But in this case, the only static that Ren receives is from the jealous boyfriend of a girl who likes Ren's big city ways. Christopher Penn starts out as one of those hicks who seems to dislike Ren, but soon finds that he has more in common with him than with his other oafish friends. Penn is particulary appealing as the left-footed fish out of water who needs to learn how to dance and sees that Ren can teach him that old one and a two. But it is the charismatic Kevin Bacon who carries this picture on his smile and feet. When Ren learns that dancing has been outlawed in his new small town home, he immediately begins a crusade to reinstall the legitimacy of rock and roll music. FOOTLOOSE has many scenes that showcase the talent of the cast's dancing. Bacon has most of the best scenes but Penn steals the show with his improved bumping, then strutting steps. Lori Singer is appealing as Bacon's female lead. John Lithgow as Singer's Bible thumping, rock and roll hating preacher father, exemplifies the hate-Elvis sector that ruled much of America's small town mentality in the fifties. The clash between the generations is highlighted not so much by the movie's use of dancing as an expression of rage against their elders, but by the concluding speech that Bacon gives that sounds as if Jimmy Stewart could not have done a better job in using the Bible as evidence that God does not disapprove of pop dancing. FOOTLOOSE is really an excuse for the cast to use dancing as a metaphor both for having fun and for expressing the same but far more muted rage that Marlon Brando snarled at his elders in THE WILD ONE.",3,Music and Dancing: Hollywood Continues the Tradition,1029024000,"08 11, 2002",2002,2301,"['Hollywood', 'love', 'affair', 'dance', 'music', 'movies', 'continued', 'unabated', 'ever', 'Fred', 'Ginger', 'waltzed', 'way', 'screen', '1930s', 'FOOTLOOSE', 'director', 'Herbert', 'Ross', 'successfully', 'melded', 'several', 'movies', 'one', 'teen', 'filled', 'angst', 'society', 'dancing', 'way', 'life', 'fitting', 'loner', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'immensely', 'appealing', 'boyish', 'good', 'looks', 'bouncing', 'feet', 'Ren', 'teen', 'who', 'moved', 'family', 'big', 'city', 'small', 'town', 'past', 'Hollywood', 'usually', 'portrayed', 'small', 'town', 'citizens', 'closed-minded', 'hicks', 'who', 'somehow', 'fear', 'city', 'slicker', 'midst', 'will', 'expose', 'hollowness', 'see', 'case', 'only', 'static', 'Ren', 'jealous', 'boyfriend', 'girl', 'who', 'Ren', 'big', 'city', 'ways', 'Christopher', 'Penn', 'out', 'one', 'hicks', 'who', 'dislike', 'Ren', 'soon', 'more', 'common', 'other', 'oafish', 'friends', 'Penn', 'particulary', 'appealing', 'left-footed', 'fish', 'water', 'who', 'learn', 'how', 'dance', 'Ren', 'can', 'teach', 'old', 'one', 'two', 'charismatic', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'who', 'picture', 'smile', 'feet', 'When', 'Ren', 'dancing', 'been', 'outlawed', 'new', 'small', 'town', 'home', 'immediately', 'crusade', 'reinstall', 'legitimacy', 'rock', 'roll', 'music', 'FOOTLOOSE', 'many', 'scenes', 'showcase', 'talent', 'cast', 'dancing', 'Bacon', 'most', 'best', 'scenes', 'Penn', 'show', 'improved', 'bumping', 'then', 'strutting', 'steps', 'Lori', 'Singer', 'appealing', 'Bacon', 'female', 'lead', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Singer', 'Bible', 'thumping', 'rock', 'roll', 'hating', 'preacher', 'father', 'hate-Elvis', 'sector', 'ruled', 'much', 'America', 'small', 'town', 'mentality', 'fifties', 'clash', 'generations', 'highlighted', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'use', 'dancing', 'expression', 'rage', 'elders', 'concluding', 'speech', 'Bacon', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'using', 'Bible', 'evidence', 'God', 'not', 'disapprove', 'pop', 'dancing', 'FOOTLOOSE', 'really', 'excuse', 'cast', 'use', 'dancing', 'metaphor', 'having', 'fun', 'expressing', 'same', 'far', 'more', 'muted', 'rage', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'snarled', 'elders', 'THE', 'WILD', 'ONE']",N/A

Kevin Bacon delivers one of his finest performance as Ren McCormick- the teenage rebel with a cause who is transplanted in a small town, who's repressive somewhat tyrannical Rev. Shaw Moore (John Lithgow) has convinced everyone in town to discard and destroy books, movies, and dancing because they are all a sign of immoral behavior.  McCormick runs afoul of the older more conservative generation who believe much like the reverend that certain books and movies confuse the soul and lead to immoral behavior. Going stir crazy in such a small town were he's labeled as a dangerous outsider, Ren decides to fight against the conservative order to get a Senior Prom for the students of Beaumont High School. He finds an unlikely collection of allies including Ariel (Lori Singer), the reverends rebellious and free minded daughter and Willard (Chris Penn), a tough guy prone to getting into fights who really can't dance at all. The cast is topped off by a wonderful, if understated performance by Diane Wiest as Rev. Moore's wife Vie.Footloose has always stood out for me because it had the depth that most movies geared towards teenagers today don't have. In Ren McCormick, there's a youthful adolescent still smarting over the perceived abandonment by his father, which causes him to be troublemaker to the small town residents of Beaumont, leading him to become this unlikely rebel with a cause character. Ariel Moore acts out because ever since her older brother died in a car crash while playing highway tag, she has been acting out trying to forget her brother on one level, while seeking to connect with her father who became more conservative after his son died. The greatest plot-line is Lithgow as Shaw Moore, who on one hand has appointed himself the spiritual light of the community, but delivers a sympathetic portrayal on the grounds that he was doing much of this because he was aroused by the tragic death of his son. Footloose speaks on issues of censorship, coming of age, and toleration.The extras here are interesting: You can watch the movie with commentary from Kevin Bacon or Producer/Writer Craig Zaden.

212527,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,6300214370,Nix Pix,"[51, 61]","Herbert Ross' ""Footloose"" is one of those feel good flicks from the 80s that has dated at about twice the rate of most films from other decades. Its story is based in fact: that of a town ordinance that banned any form of public dancing. When Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) arrives with his family he can barely contain his distemper over the outdated law. He's young, rebellious and full of energy that just needs to be expressed. Together with the rest of the town's high school brethren, Ren resolves to challenge the law and its most ardent supporter, Rev. Shaw Moore - who lost his only son after a night of drunken abandonment and a fatal car accident and thereafter blamed rock music for everything. Moore's daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) is behind Ren's move to ditch the law. Actually, she's the model of good girl/bad girl, staying out late, smoking and making out with her studly boyfriend. The film also co-stars Chris Penn as Willard, a clutsy cowboy who becomes a high steppin' catch after Red teaches him all the right moves. And somewhere in this little trifle you'll find Sarah Jessica Parker as Rusty, another high school senior in desperate need of a better hairdo and a lot less lipstick.Before you pull out you're wallet and cut loose you may want to consider that Paramount's new Special Edition of ""Footloose"" offers NO improvement over the previously issued DVD. The transfers are identical in their image and sound quality and a complete and thorough disappointment to watch. An incredible amount of film grain plagues many of the opening scenes. There's also more than ample digital grit and aliasing and edge enhancement problems to go around. Age related artifacts crop up everywhere and are distracting. Colors are muted and, at times, extremely muddy and dated. Black levels are never black but a tonal mess of brown and gray. Really, there's nothing to get excited about here. Extras include a three part documentary (it's beyond me why Paramount continues to take one documentary and chop it into three short featurettes that can't be simultaneously played) that includes interviews with the cast and crew and the film's theatrical trailer. Truthfully, though, this is not an outstanding or even ample effort for the folks on the mountain.",2,"DISMAL IMAGE QUALITY NEEDS TO BE ""CUT LOOSE""!",1096156800,"09 26, 2004",2004,2266,"['Herbert', 'Ross', 'Footloose', 'one', 'feel', 'good', 'flicks', '80s', 'dated', 'twice', 'rate', 'most', 'films', 'other', 'decades', 'story', 'based', 'fact', 'town', 'ordinance', 'banned', 'form', 'public', 'dancing', 'When', 'Ren', 'McCormack', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'family', 'can', 'barely', 'contain', 'distemper', 'outdated', 'law', 'young', 'rebellious', 'full', 'energy', 'just', 'be', 'expressed', 'Together', 'rest', 'town', 'high', 'school', 'brethren', 'Ren', 'challenge', 'law', 'most', 'ardent', 'supporter', 'Rev', 'Shaw', 'Moore', 'who', 'lost', 'only', 'son', 'night', 'drunken', 'abandonment', 'fatal', 'car', 'accident', 'thereafter', 'blamed', 'rock', 'music', 'everything', 'Moore', 'daughter', 'Ariel', 'Lori', 'Singer', 'Ren', 'move', 'ditch', 'law', 'Actually', 'model', 'good', 'girl/bad', 'girl', 'staying', 'out', 'late', 'smoking', 'making', 'out', 'studly', 'boyfriend', 'film', 'also', 'Chris', 'Penn', 'Willard', 'clutsy', 'cowboy', 'who', 'high', 'steppin', 'catch', 'Red', 'right', 'moves', 'somewhere', 'little', 'trifle', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Rusty', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'desperate', 'need', 'better', 'hairdo', 'lot', 'less', 'pull', 'out', ""'re"", 'wallet', 'cut', 'loose', 'may', 'want', 'consider', 'Paramount', 'new', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Footloose', 'NO', 'improvement', 'previously', 'issued', 'DVD', 'transfers', 'are', 'identical', 'image', 'sound', 'quality', 'complete', 'thorough', 'disappointment', 'watch', 'incredible', 'amount', 'film', 'grain', 'plagues', 'many', 'opening', 'scenes', 'also', 'more', 'ample', 'digital', 'grit', 'aliasing', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'problems', 'go', 'around', 'Age', 'related', 'artifacts', 'crop', 'everywhere', 'are', 'distracting', 'Colors', 'are', 'muted', 'times', 'extremely', 'muddy', 'dated', 'Black', 'levels', 'are', 'never', 'black', 'tonal', 'mess', 'brown', 'gray', 'Really', 'nothing', 'get', 'excited', 'here', 'Extras', 'include', 'three', 'part', 'documentary', 'why', 'Paramount', 'take', 'one', 'documentary', 'chop', 'three', 'short', 'featurettes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'simultaneously', 'played', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'film', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Truthfully', 'though', 'not', 'outstanding', 'even', 'ample', 'effort', 'folks', 'mountain']",N/A

212532,A3R132H7T53FD5,6300214370,Peter Jaworski,"[1, 2]","Footloose is a rock rebellion story about a big city kid (Kevin Bacon) who moves into a deeply religious small community that has banned all manner of things, like rock and roll and dancing. Bacon's character is determined to change peoples minds about the 'dangers' of rock music and gyrations of the body.The movie is rich and paradigmatic of the rebellious teen genre. Handsome people, great music, impatient screen shots, and a plot that includes some dynamism and general excitement.There are two trouble spots, however. For one, I can't quite understand why Kevin Bacon's character falls for the preacher's daughter. Shy of any redeemable character traits, she is a crass, rude, obnoxious, and terribly immature young lady.Agreed, she has a troubled life, and throughout the movie you do get hints of what she may be like in the future. There is clearly a sense that she will stop living through the rebellion of others, and will grow as a person. Nevertheless, other than her beauty, it is difficult to understand why Bacon's character falls for her.The other trouble is with the big defense scene, where a case is made for allowing the teens to have a prom dance party. The defense is structured entirely out of a biblical perspective--since they danced to celebrate and give thanks to God, so, too, should the kids be allowed to celebrate by dancing. This is smart because the town is a Bible-thumping town, but the writers could have added a defense of dancing on grounds other than religious (freedom of expression, for instance).Other than that, the movie is fabulous. Great dance scenes, and music that still inspires and is catchy many years later. I especially enjoyed the portrayal of the preacher in the movie as dynamic, rather than as a stale caricature of the small-minded, small town preacher cliche depicted in many other movies. His eventual tolerance, if not acceptance, of rock &amp; roll dancing was endearing and appropriate.Overall, the movie is worth a look.",4,"Dancin', dancin', dancin' (she's a dancing machine)...",1044403200,"02 5, 2003",2003,1987,"['Footloose', 'rock', 'rebellion', 'story', 'big', 'city', 'kid', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'who', 'deeply', 'religious', 'small', 'community', 'banned', 'manner', 'things', 'rock', 'roll', 'dancing', 'Bacon', 'character', 'determined', 'change', 'peoples', ""'dangers"", 'rock', 'music', 'gyrations', 'body.The', 'movie', 'rich', 'paradigmatic', 'rebellious', 'teen', 'genre', 'Handsome', 'people', 'great', 'music', 'impatient', 'screen', 'shots', 'plot', 'dynamism', 'general', 'are', 'two', 'trouble', 'spots', 'however', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'why', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'character', 'preacher', 'daughter', 'Shy', 'redeemable', 'character', 'traits', 'crass', 'rude', 'obnoxious', 'terribly', 'immature', 'young', 'lady.Agreed', 'troubled', 'life', 'movie', 'do', 'get', 'hints', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'future', 'clearly', 'sense', 'will', 'stop', 'living', 'rebellion', 'others', 'will', 'grow', 'person', 'Nevertheless', 'other', 'beauty', 'difficult', 'understand', 'why', 'Bacon', 'character', 'her.The', 'other', 'trouble', 'big', 'defense', 'scene', 'where', 'case', 'made', 'allowing', 'teens', 'have', 'prom', 'dance', 'party', 'defense', 'structured', 'entirely', 'biblical', 'perspective', 'danced', 'celebrate', 'give', 'thanks', 'God', 'so', 'too', 'should', 'kids', 'be', 'allowed', 'celebrate', 'dancing', 'smart', 'town', 'Bible-thumping', 'town', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'defense', 'dancing', 'grounds', 'other', 'religious', 'freedom', 'expression', 'instance', '.Other', 'movie', 'fabulous', 'Great', 'dance', 'scenes', 'music', 'still', 'catchy', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'portrayal', 'preacher', 'movie', 'dynamic', 'rather', 'stale', 'caricature', 'small-minded', 'small', 'town', 'preacher', 'cliche', 'depicted', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'eventual', 'tolerance', 'not', 'acceptance', 'rock', 'amp', 'roll', 'dancing', 'was', 'endearing', 'appropriate.Overall', 'movie', 'look']",N/A

212537,A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q,6300214370,Priscilla Stafford,"[17, 25]","Teenager Ren MacCormack (Kevin Bacon) moves with his mom from big city Chicago to a small town in the Midwest after his parent's divorce. Ren is suprised to find that it's against the law to listen to rock 'n' roll and the law also prohibits dancing! Ren can't understand why these laws were brought about but tries his hardest to fit in with the town people. Unfortunately, though he's accepted as a friend by fellow student Willard (Chris Penn), no one else seems to like him, calling him a 'big-city kid' and a trouble-maker. After a while, he comes up with a plan to try to make it possible for the Senior students to be able to have a prom dance. He'll be going against the whole town, most specifically the Reverend Shaw Moore (John Lithgow) and the town council. Will Ren be able to change the stiff necked town people's minds? At the same time, Ren begins to fall in love with the Reverend's wild and unpredictable daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) while trying to keep his distance from her boyfriend Chuck (Jim Youngs). Also starring is Sarah Jessica Parker as Ariel's best friend Rusty, Dianne Wiest as the Reverend's wife Vi, and John Laughlin and Timothy Scott play Woody and Andy Beami, two of Ren's allies.*PLOT* - This is my first and only 80's dance movie to watch and I must say that I very much enjoyed it. The plot was interesting though of course some points were a bit unrealistic. Basically the movie is in a way a 'coming-of-age' film. I loved the way each of the characters are portrayed. Kevin Bacon's character Ren represents the 'hero' of the movie. At first when I read the reviews I thought Ren would be your typical rebellious teenager. A bit on the contraire, he is responsible and you can't help but feel proud of him when he brings his case up to the council. It's hard to explain and I can't tell you much since this is only a review, but I must say that Ren's character was extremely well-done. Ariel on the other hand is very rebellious, and flaunts it to her father. I loved how she and her father were able to resolve their problems at the end.*ACTING* - Kevin Bacon definitely steals the whole movie with his acting. He plays the part of a teenager perfectly, even the way he walks. His dancing was also spectacular, most notably his solo dance at the warehouse to the music, ""Never"" by Moving Pictures. If he was doing only half of what we see on screen, I'd still be impressed. John Lithgow is also outstanding, it was interesting to see his dramatic abilities after watching him on goofball comedy tv series, ""3rd Rock from the Sun"". He certainly can put power in his 'sermons'! Lori Singer beautifully stunning as Ariel, a perfect example of the category of 'wild and beautiful'. Besides the character of her father, Singer's character of Ariel has the most development in the movie.*DANCING* - The dancing is just pure fun to watch, especially for people who loves 80's dancing. The last dance was not only the best dance, but the best part of the whole movie. If by chance somebody didn't enjoy the movie, I'm sure the end will make up for it. I loved it so much, I downloaded that segment onto my computer so I can watch it any time.*SOUNDTRACK* - The soundtrack is another plus side to the movie. Besides the ""Top Gun"" soundtrack, ""Footloose"" is on my top list of favorite movie soundtracks. Great songs include two by Kenny Loggins, ""Footloose"" and ""I'm Free (Heaven Helps the Man"". Other of my favorites include ""Let's Hear It For the Boy"" (Denise Williams), ""Almost Paradise"" (Ann Wilson/Mike Reno), ""Somebody's Eyes"" (Karla Bonoff), and ""Hurts So Good"" (John Cougar Mellencamp). Plus there's plenty more!*PG Rating* - From here I will be giving you the downside to the movie ""Footloose"". I was extremely disappointed that the movie does not hold true to what a real PG movie should be. There are many reasons as to why this movie should be changed to a PG-13 rating. Though the movie is about a small town which has a dislike for rock music and dancing, the movie portrays some of the teenagers there as being very immoral. Besides having sexual innuendo, some violence, and drugs scattered all over the movie, the language is also pretty strong. I strongly recommend parents not to have younger children watching this movie. Best for kids 15 and older.Overall, ""Footloose"" has the great elements to make a good movie; great story, terrific acting, nice music, and cool dancing. But it also shows some of the immoralities of teenagers so parents should be cautioned. The movie is more aimed towards teenage viewers and adults might not find this movie terribly entertaining. But then again, adults might enjoy the movie for they might be able to relate to John Lithgow's character as the father who does not want to let go of his daughter because of his love for her.",3,"Fun and entertaining movie, but rated PG?

212553,A26A8T38C2GQD7,6300214370,Taheen Lopez,"[1, 1]","This Paramount musical drama that was released on Friday February 17, 1984 is about an upbeat Chicago teen Ren McCormack(Kevin Bacon)who moves to a small rural town called Bomont, Utah to live with his aunt & uncle and discovers that dancing & rock music have been restricted by Bomont's city council and falls in love with the rebellious popular girl Ariel Moore(Lori Singer)who has a sleazy boyfriend Chuck Cranston(James Youngs)and an overprotective religious father Rev. Shaw Moore(John Lithgow)whom is also a big authority figure in Bomont, but then at the conclusion, Rev. Moore has a change of heart just before everybody gets down at the high school Senior prom and everybody lives happily ever after.This is also the movie that launched Kevin Bacon's acting career too, but Tom Cruise and Rob Lowe were considered to play the role of Ren McCormack since Cruise's famous underwear dance scene in RISKY BUSINESS in the Summer of 1983, but was unavailable for the part since he was already doing ALL THE RIGHT MOVES.Rob Lowe had auditioned for the part of Ren McCormack 3 times and had the dancing ability & ""neutral teen"" look that the director wanted, but Lowe was declined for the role, due to injuries.Additionally; Kevin Bacon had also been offered the role of Arnold Cunningham in John Carpenter's CHRISTINE in 1983 at the same time he was asked to audition for the Ren McCormack character on FOOTLOOSE, but Bacon chose to take the gamble on a screen test for FOOTLOOSE and the director(Herb Ross)had convinced the producers & directors to hire Bacon after watching Kevin Bacon in his previous flick DINER back in the Summer of 1982.In addition to some interesting facts on the making of this musical drama; Madonna, Brooke Shields, Daryl Hannah, Heather Locklear, Liz Montgovern, Melanie Griifith, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jamie Lee Curtis, Rosanna Arquette, Meg Tilly, Meg Ryan, Jodie Foster, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Bridget Fonda, Lori Loughlin, Diane Lane, Phoebe Cates, Tatum O'Neal, and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss were all considered for the role of the reckless, but independent Ariel Moore.*Madonna had auditioned for the Ariel Moore character, but was rejected.*Daryl Hannah had declined the offer to play Ariel in order to portray the cheif character Madison in the comedy/drama flick SPLASH with Tom Hanks in the Summer of 1984*Liz Montgovern turned down the role of Ariel to play Deborah Gelly in ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICAFOOTLOOSE was also a stepping stone for Chris Penn(Willard Hewitt)and Sarah Jessica Parker(Rusty)since Penn and Parker weren't even famous when they co-starred in this movie.This movie also had a lot of cool hit songs like*FOOTLOOSE by Kenny Loggins*ALMOST PARADISE by Mike Reno & Ann Wilson*DANCING IN THE SHEETS by Shalamar*I'M FREE by Kenny Loggins*HURTS SO GOOD by John Couger Mellencamp*WAITING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU by ForeignerOverall, FOOTLOOSE grossed $80,035, 403 at the box office when it was released back in the Winter of 1984 on Presidents Day weekend.",5,The movie that made Kevin Bacon a star,1366070400,"04 16, 2013",2013,2998,"['Paramount', 'musical', 'drama', 'was', 'released', 'Friday', 'February', '17', '1984', 'upbeat', 'Chicago', 'teen', 'Ren', 'McCormack', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'who', 'small', 'rural', 'town', 'called', 'Bomont', 'Utah', 'live', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'discovers', 'dancing', 'rock', 'music', 'have', 'been', 'restricted', 'Bomont', 'city', 'council', 'love', 'rebellious', 'popular', 'girl', 'Ariel', 'Moore', 'Lori', 'Singer', 'who', 'sleazy', 'boyfriend', 'Chuck', 'Cranston', 'James', 'Youngs', 'overprotective', 'religious', 'father', 'Rev', 'Shaw', 'Moore', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'whom', 'also', 'big', 'authority', 'figure', 'Bomont', 'then', 'conclusion', 'Rev', 'Moore', 'change', 'heart', 'just', 'everybody', 'down', 'high', 'school', 'Senior', 'prom', 'everybody', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.This', 'also', 'movie', 'launched', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'acting', 'career', 'too', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'were', 'considered', 'play', 'role', 'Ren', 'McCormack', 'Cruise', 'famous', 'underwear', 'dance', 'scene', 'RISKY', 'BUSINESS', 'Summer', '1983', 'was', 'unavailable', 'part', 'was', 'already', 'doing', 'THE', 'RIGHT', 'MOVES.Rob', 'Lowe', 'had', 'auditioned', 'part', 'Ren', 'McCormack', '3', 'times', 'had', 'dancing', 'ability', 'neutral', 'teen', 'look', 'director', 'wanted', 'Lowe', 'was', 'declined', 'role', 'due', 'injuries.Additionally', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'had', 'also', 'been', 'offered', 'role', 'Arnold', 'Cunningham', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'CHRISTINE', '1983', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'asked', 'audition', 'Ren', 'McCormack', 'character', 'FOOTLOOSE', 'Bacon', 'chose', 'take', 'gamble', 'screen', 'test', 'FOOTLOOSE', 'director', 'Herb', 'Ross', 'had', 'convinced', 'producers', 'directors', 'hire', 'Bacon', 'watching', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'previous', 'flick', 'DINER', 'back', 'Summer', '1982.In', 'addition', 'interesting', 'facts', 'making', 'musical', 'drama', 'Madonna', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'Heather', 'Locklear', 'Liz', 'Montgovern', 'Melanie', 'Griifith', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'Rosanna', 'Arquette', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'Lori', 'Loughlin', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'Tatum', ""O'Neal"", 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfuss', 'were', 'considered', 'role', 'reckless', 'independent', 'Ariel', 'Moore', '*Madonna', 'had', 'auditioned', 'Ariel', 'Moore', 'character', 'was', 'rejected', '*Daryl', 'Hannah', 'had', 'declined', 'offer', 'play', 'Ariel', 'order', 'portray', 'cheif', 'character', 'Madison', 'comedy/drama', 'flick', 'SPLASH', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Summer', '1984*Liz', 'Montgovern', 'turned', 'down', 'role', 'Ariel', 'play', 'Deborah', 'Gelly', 'ONCE', 'A', 'TIME', 'IN', 'AMERICAFOOTLOOSE', 'was', 'also', 'stepping', 'stone', 'Chris', 'Penn', 'Willard', 'Hewitt', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Rusty', 'Penn', 'Parker', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'famous', 'when', 'co-starred', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'also', 'had', 'lot', 'cool', 'hit', 'songs', 'like*FOOTLOOSE', 'Kenny', 'Loggins*ALMOST', 'PARADISE', 'Mike', 'Reno', 'Ann', 'Wilson*DANCING', 'IN', 'THE', 'SHEETS', 'Shalamar*I', ""'M"", 'FREE', 'Kenny', 'Loggins*HURTS', 'SO', 'GOOD', 'John', 'Couger', 'Mellencamp*WAITING', 'A', 'GIRL', 'LIKE', 'YOU', 'ForeignerOverall', 'FOOTLOOSE', 'grossed', '80,035', '403', 'box', 'office', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'back', 'Winter', '1984', 'Presidents', 'Day', 'weekend']",N/A

Of course, Kevin Bacon in the lead role of ""Ren"" is just riveting. The dancing, choreographed by Lynne Taylor-Corbett, is good but not too good.

The main character, Ren (Kevin Bacon), is no dandy -- in fact, he can kick some arse if necessary -- and he's not dancing through the halls of the high school every other scene.THE PLOT: Dancing and loud music have been banned in the Utah town of Bomont because of an accident that killed the son of the town's main pastor (John Lithgow). His daughter, Ariel (Lori Singer), rebels against the legalism through daring -- near suicidal -- acts and fornication. Ren takes a liking to Ariel and endeavors to free the town of its stifling legalism.Also on hand are Chris Penn as Ren's country boy pal, Willard, and Sarah Jessica Parker as Ariel's friend, Rusty. Penn's character is real fun and Sarah was a real cutie back in '84.Although I didn't see ""Footloose"" for almost 30 years, the film has acquired a respectable following. Maybe this is what inspired me to finally give-in and view it. I now understand why it's been so popular. ""Footloose"" has that cinematic magic that pulls you in and gives you a good time. This is just a really entertaining movie.I also like the depth. We understand Rev. Shaw's grief, but his legalism isn't doing his people or his town any good. I also like how Shaw isn't made out to be the clich&eacute;d villain. This is a good man thinking he's doing good for his town, and in many ways he is, but the legalistic spirit he cops is sapping the life out of him, his family, his congregants and his town. Does he have the wisdom to see his error and re-route? See the film.The film runs 107 minutes and was shot in areas 30 minutes south of Salt Lake City, on the eastern side of Utah Lake.GRADE: A",5,"""a time to mourn and a time to dance"" (Ecclesiastes 3:4)",1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,1891,"[""'ve"", 'stayed', 'away', 'film', '29', 'years', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'scathing', 'review', 'fact', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'big', 'city', 'fop', 'moving', 'small', 'town', 'dancing', 'tables', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'etc', 'was', 'wrong', 'so', 'was', 'Ebert', 'main', 'character', 'Ren', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'dandy', 'fact', 'can', 'kick', 'arse', 'necessary', 'not', 'dancing', 'halls', 'high', 'school', 'other', 'scene.THE', 'PLOT', 'Dancing', 'loud', 'music', 'have', 'been', 'banned', 'Utah', 'town', 'Bomont', 'accident', 'killed', 'son', 'town', 'main', 'pastor', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'daughter', 'Ariel', 'Lori', 'Singer', 'rebels', 'legalism', 'daring', 'suicidal', 'acts', 'fornication', 'Ren', 'liking', 'Ariel', 'endeavors', 'free', 'town', 'stifling', 'legalism.Also', 'hand', 'are', 'Chris', 'Penn', 'Ren', 'country', 'boy', 'pal', 'Willard', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Ariel', 'friend', 'Rusty', 'Penn', 'character', 'real', 'fun', 'Sarah', 'was', 'real', 'cutie', 'back', ""'84.Although"", 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Footloose', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'film', 'acquired', 'respectable', 'following', 'Maybe', 'what', 'inspired', 'finally', 'give-in', 'view', 'now', 'understand', 'why', 'been', 'so', 'popular', 'Footloose', 'cinematic', 'magic', 'good', 'time', 'just', 'really', 'entertaining', 'movie.I', 'also', 'depth', 'understand', 'Rev', 'Shaw', 'grief', 'legalism', ""n't"", 'doing', 'people', 'town', 'good', 'also', 'how', 'Shaw', ""n't"", 'made', 'out', 'be', 'clich', 'eacute', 'villain', 'good', 'man', 'thinking', 'doing', 'good', 'town', 'many', 'ways', 'legalistic', 'spirit', 'sapping', 'life', 'family', 'congregants', 'town', 'have', 'wisdom', 'see', 'error', 're-route', 'See', 'film.The', 'film', '107', 'minutes', 'was', 'shot', 'areas', '30', 'minutes', 'south', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'eastern', 'side', 'Utah', 'Lake.GRADE', 'A']",N/A
