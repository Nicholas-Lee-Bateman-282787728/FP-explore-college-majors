The most remarkable thing about DH2 is that, somehow, the filmmakers managed to squeeze everything you could possibly do wrong while shooting a movie into one painstakingly-boring project. Evidently shot by someone who has never attended a single film class (nor even seen a successful horror film), this travesty chugs along for over an hour-and-a-half. Two girls and their dim-witted Dad are stalked (ha, get it) in a cornfield maze by a gaggle of cackling jack-o-lanterns and a rubber-booted killer, while attempting to solve the mysterious disappearance of a couple of autistic, conjoined twins... or something along those lines.

931973,AD9MPLYLMHKCC,B000ARTMT8,Ghoulie Guru,"[7, 7]","Well, shuck me sideways. I haven't seen a home movie this bad since the abysmal 13 SECONDS or HALF CASTE. Someone should take away this guy's Sony Handycam! This movie proves that just because you can make a movie on your camcorder for $20, doesn't necessarily mean you should.I remember that one of the things that Robert Rodriguez wrote in his book, ""Rebel Without a Crew"" was that when you set out to make a no budget feature, you have to use whatever assets you have at your disposal. Rodriguez says that you should take an inventory of all the locations and props that you can beg, steal and borrow from your friends. Robert Rodriquez was friends with the Mayor of some town in Mexico, so the Mayor let him shoot all over for free. What you got in EL MARIACHI was a movie that looked like it cost much more than the actual budget.I'm sure that the director of this movie has a copy of that book, and he took that advice to heart. In this case, he was apparently friends with a guy who owned a cornfield where they put on a haunted house every year. Seems like a pretty good location for a scary movie, but it's hard to keep a cornfield interesting for 90 minutes. Not a single installment of the CHILDREN OF THE CORN series spent more than a few minutes in the cornfield. Hitchcock only spent about ten minutes in one in NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Take a hint, fella... cornfields don't make for riveting cinema. It would have been good if the director would have had more friends with more locations, because this thing gets pretty tedious after the first 15 minutes. This movie looks like it cost about $30. (or whatever it cost in admission to the cornfield maze).Apparently he couldn't even find anyone to act in his movie, so he cast himself. Big mistake. Here's a thought, if you really want to make a movie, get an actor. So, as far as assets go, it seems like the cornfield maze is the only thing the poor guy had. Maybe he thought that was enough. In fact, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that I KNOW he thought that was enough because the movie, before it captured the coveted honor of being the sequel to DARK HARVEST, was called simply THE MAIZE: THE MOVIE. Maybe this he's already planning THE MAIZE: THE MUSICAL or even THE MAIZE: THE MINI-SERIES.Our Jack-Of-All-Trades (and yes, the Master of Nothing part of that saying is definitely appropriate here) plays a psychic dad who can tell when bad things are going to happen. Think of the character from the DEAD ZONE, but not anywhere near as good an actor as Christopher Walken or even Anthony Michael Hall. Psychic Dad has a premonition that his two daughers, who are at the corn maze with mom, are going to be killed. He rushes to save them. From that point on, the whole movie is spent watching Pyschic Dad run around in a cornfield, looking for his two daughters. He finds the two little girl ghosts from THE SHINING, and he helps solve the mystery of their murder.Shot on a $200 Handycam. The director cast himself. Edited on iMovie. Improvised story. If that's not enough to keep you away from this a-maize-ingly corny catastrophy, consider this as a final warning... The WHOLE MOVIE takes place in a cornfield, boils and ghouls. Here's Ghoulie Guru's tip on how to save some money and still feel like you've seen this movie. Next time you see a cornfield, stop the car.

My husband and I thought we would at least get a little of the excitement we got watching the first Dark Harvest movie. He fell asleep within the first 18 minutes. I continued to watch thinking that it had to get better. You know how some movies start out slow but steadily gain momentum. That didn't happen with this movie. This is the only movie I have ever watched that actually beat my all-time, most disappointing movie ever, choice (Blair Witch Project). Like a previous reviewer stated, ""It really is that bad."" No plot, no script, no acting (my Chow could have done a better job than the people cast in this movie). So if you really must spend your money, go rent Blair Witch Project, you'll have more fun with it than you ever will with this piece of junk. That is, unless of course you enjoy walking through a corn field in endless circles searching for two little girls who must be deaf as stone posts since they are only two or three rows away and can't seem to here their father calling them, which he does periodically.

931977,A1PY83VL3VJ1FV,B000ARTMT8,Sacred Dust,"[1, 2]","Dark Harvest 2 is a tragic example of what can happen when someone has a cheap camcorder, a bad idea, no talent and too much free time. It's nothing new--lots of ""movies"" just like this are made every year in America, usually as jokes or exercises in student filmmaking. The only difference is that this one somehow got a mass DVD release.First, a little background info: the Dark Harvest series is known (by very few) as a line of B-horror films about a killer scarecrow. At least, that's what Dark Harvest 1 and 3 are about. But not this one. Even though it has the Dark Harvest title, and there is a killer scarecrow with a scythe right on the front of the case, the disc, and the DVD menu...this movie has no killer scarecrow. None. Nor was it made by the same folks responsible for DH 1 and 3. But Lion's Gate released it anyway, and we are paying the price for their deception.Now that you know what this movie isn't, I'll tell you what it is. Dark Harvest 2 is an unbearable amateur film about some guy who runs around shouting in a cornfield maze, looking for his two kids for an hour and a half. It is a confusing, poorly edited blur of the dad running, his daughters arguing and screaming, his wife waiting for them outside the maze (maize), a hundred shots of some guy's feet (the bad guy's, as it turns out), two dead girls who talk at the same time like in The Shining...and finally, lots and lots and lots of corn. You will dream about corn after seeing this. You will not want to eat corn again for a year. If you ever see a cornfield again, you will be tempted to set it on fire.The director (Bill Cowell) is also the star and producer, and 95% of his movie takes place on a farm in some Midwestern town.The acting is very poor on the part of everyone involved. All the performers were probably local residents, and I am willing to let them off the hook to some extent. But there is no excuse for the atrocity that was the script. It sounds like something I would have written in the fifth grade. (Walker calls the killer ""a coward-ous lame-ass,"" even though cowardice is a noun, not an adjective. And yes, the closed captioning does spell it ""coward-ous."") Don't expect much from the music, either; most of it is that silly, droning noise you would hear on any generic ""Halloween sounds"" CD.If you can watch Dark Harvest 2 without lapsing into a catatonic episode, you will find yourself wondering about many things. You'll wonder how people could possibly say those lines in front of a camera and think they sounded good. You'll wonder what could have been going through Bill Cowell's corn-addled mind when he decided other people all over the country should be able to see this. But most of all, you will wonder how and why it was released as a fraudulent sequel to a completely different movie by the most successful independent film company in North America.The bottom line: Dark Harvest 2 is a dreadful, depressing bore. Only watch it out of morbid fascination. Or better yet, offer it to the film studies program of your local college, so all of the students can learn how NOT to make a movie.",1,Get ready to hate corn for the rest of your life...,1247443200,"07 13, 2009",2009,3116,"['Dark', 'Harvest', '2', 'tragic', 'example', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'someone', 'cheap', 'camcorder', 'bad', 'idea', 'talent', 'too', 'much', 'free', 'time', 'nothing', 'new', 'lots', 'movies', 'just', 'are', 'made', 'year', 'America', 'usually', 'jokes', 'exercises', 'student', 'filmmaking', 'only', 'difference', 'one', 'somehow', 'got', 'mass', 'DVD', 'release.First', 'little', 'background', 'info', 'Dark', 'Harvest', 'series', 'known', 'very', 'few', 'line', 'B-horror', 'films', 'killer', 'scarecrow', 'least', 'what', 'Dark', 'Harvest', '1', '3', 'are', 'not', 'one', 'Even', 'Dark', 'Harvest', 'title', 'killer', 'scarecrow', 'scythe', 'right', 'front', 'case', 'disc', 'DVD', 'menu', 'movie', 'killer', 'scarecrow', 'None', 'was', 'made', 'same', 'folks', 'responsible', 'DH', '1', '3', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'released', 'anyway', 'are', 'paying', 'price', 'deception.Now', 'know', 'what', 'movie', ""n't"", ""'ll"", 'tell', 'what', 'Dark', 'Harvest', '2', 'unbearable', 'amateur', 'film', 'guy', 'who', 'around', 'shouting', 'cornfield', 'maze', 'looking', 'two', 'kids', 'hour', 'half', 'confusing', 'poorly', 'edited', 'blur', 'dad', 'running', 'daughters', 'arguing', 'screaming', 'wife', 'waiting', 'maze', 'maize', 'hundred', 'shots', 'guy', 'feet', 'bad', 'guy', 'out', 'two', 'dead', 'girls', 'who', 'talk', 'same', 'time', 'Shining', 'finally', 'lots', 'lots', 'lots', 'corn', 'will', 'dream', 'corn', 'seeing', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'eat', 'corn', 'again', 'year', 'ever', 'see', 'cornfield', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'tempted', 'set', 'fire.The', 'director', 'Bill', 'Cowell', 'also', 'star', 'producer', '95', '%', 'movie', 'place', 'farm', 'Midwestern', 'town.The', 'acting', 'very', 'poor', 'part', 'everyone', 'involved', 'performers', 'were', 'probably', 'local', 'residents', 'am', 'willing', 'let', 'off', 'hook', 'extent', 'excuse', 'atrocity', 'was', 'script', 'something', 'would', 'have', 'written', 'fifth', 'grade', 'Walker', 'killer', 'coward-ous', 'lame-ass', 'even', 'cowardice', 'noun', 'not', 'adjective', 'yes', 'closed', 'captioning', 'spell', 'coward-ous', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'music', 'either', 'most', 'silly', 'droning', 'noise', 'would', 'hear', 'generic', 'Halloween', 'CD.If', 'can', 'watch', 'Dark', 'Harvest', '2', 'lapsing', 'catatonic', 'episode', 'will', 'find', 'wondering', 'about', 'many', 'things', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'how', 'people', 'could', 'possibly', 'say', 'lines', 'front', 'camera', 'think', 'sounded', 'good', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'Bill', 'Cowell', 'corn-addled', 'mind', 'when', 'decided', 'other', 'people', 'country', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'most', 'will', 'wonder', 'how', 'why', 'was', 'released', 'fraudulent', 'sequel', 'completely', 'different', 'movie', 'most', 'successful', 'independent', 'film', 'company', 'North', 'America.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'Dark', 'Harvest', '2', 'dreadful', 'depressing', 'bore', 'Only', 'watch', 'morbid', 'fascination', 'better', 'yet', 'offer', 'film', 'studies', 'program', 'local', 'college', 'students', 'can', 'learn', 'how', 'NOT', 'make', 'movie']",N/A
