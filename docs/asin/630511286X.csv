It's a shame because this is really a well-made, intriguing thriller that only Robert Altman could make. Rumour has it, he completely demolished John Grisham's original story and basically did his own thing--which is what Altman is famous for. The results? An unusual mystery that gets under your skin with characters that are flawed and always interesting to watch.Much was made about Kenneth Branagh's Southern accent... or lack thereof. To tell you the truth, it really didn't bother me all that much and I think he pulled it off. He certainly is a flawed character, vain, self-absorbed but through the course of the movie he certainly learns his lesson as his whole world gets tossed upside down.This movie really is about human behaviour as opposed to a concrete A to B to C linear plot. The mystery is really just window dressing to get all of these characters together and see what happens.As always, Altman has assembled a top notch cast with the likes of Daryl Hannah (?!) and Tom Berenger plucked out of obscurity for solid performances. Robert Duvall also turns up as a crazed hobo character. He makes the most of his limited screen time. And of course, good ol' reliable Robert Downey, Jr. turns in another wonderfully eccentric turn as a slightly-sleazy private detective who's buddies with Branagh's character. He steals every scene that he's in.The DVD is quite good. The audio and video is excellent. As another reviewer pointed out, if you have a surround sound set-up it feels like the tropical storm in the movie is all around you. Altman really knows how to build atmosphere and suggest a specific place.This is a really good movie.

However, there are a few things that keep this film from being something much greater.After recently viewing it again, I now see that Kenneth Branagh, the main character, is actually unsympathetic and not all that bright. I think his character is just not clearly defined. He really is a blatant womanizer, but unfortunately that point is not strongly conveyed to the viewer. If it were, that would explain a lot of his behavior and the very poor judgment that he uses for such a high powered attorney that he is playing. He essentially falls for a woman, the wrong woman. That is a key plot point that is never reinforced and it is an essential one. Another, point that I see more clearly now is the credibility of some of the events. For a realistic looking film, these are blatantly obvious. How could a bunch of old vagrants and alcoholics break into a mental institution and rescue their buddy played by Robert Duval? How could someone fire a flare gun in a furious hurricane with driving winds and torrential rain from about 40 feet away and hit a man square in the back and kill him? These elements defy all credibility especially considering the tone of this film.I very much liked this film the first time I saw it and there is a lot to recommend.

A primary flaw is its inability to get us behind its protagonist in any way- Rick MacGruder (Kenneth Branagh) is pompous, vain, and tempestuous.  As an attorney, he is the polar opposite of Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch, willing to sink to any level in order to win a case.  When MacGruder helps a young woman deal with her mentally unstable father, we know he is doing so out of a desire to get in her pants rather than any sort of altruism.  It is simply hard to care for him as his situation deteriorates- indeed, one almost gets the feeling that karma is simply at work.Another issue is the plot.  While twists and turns are fine, this film saves all of them for the final thirty minutes, and they feel a little overwhelming.  While you are trying to figure out how one twist happened, the next one barrels onto the screen.Stylistically, the film has some interesting and cool moments.  The slick opening shot, accompanied by the discordant score, takes us over the Georgia coastal plain and eventually tracks MacGruder's car over the Talmadge Bridge and into Savannah.  It hardly matters that traveling from Jacksonville to Savannah (as we are told) doesn't take you over said bridge.  The setting is an important part of the story, and Savannah is a location that never fails to lend its uniqueness to a film.On the whole, The Gingerbread Man has some genuinely suspenseful moments (Duvall is particularly menacing) but it is otherwise disengaging.

The main problem is that the plot's so-called twist is obvious from the moment Mallory steals an ashtray from Rick Magruder's office and her car is ""conveniently stolen.""  From thereon, the plot moves a little too slowly towards a not wholly satisfying denouement.  Along the way, we're treated to some interesting, althought not spectacular, acting.  Kenneth Branagh does his Southern accent dutifully well for a Brit, but his performance is too hammy at times to be convincing; Embeth Davidtz as Mallory invokes little sympathy because the discerning viewer knows there's more than meets the eye; Darryl Hannah is hardly recognizable as Lois, an associate of Branagh, whose main function seems more clerical than legal; Tom Berenger shows up as Davidtz's ex-husband, whose mere presence in a seemingly incidental role is in itself a plot give-away; Robert Downey Jr. appears as Clyde, Branagh's private investigator who is a hopeless alcoholic; and Robert Duvall, looking foolish in a baldpate and long hair, has an enigmatic but pivotal role as Davidtz's eccentric if not looney father.Never being one of Altman's greatest fans, I can commend him on trying to add a different touch to a rather familiar formula, including the relentless rain during Hurricane Geraldo.

Then when the latter escapes from a psychiatric hospital things start to get complicated.

Which makes this an intriguing project for him as what could be more mainstream, run of the mill Hollywood than a hot and sweaty Southern-based legal thriller from a John Grisham story? The result is certainly interesting, though not helped by the casting of one of my least favourite actors, the consistently lacklustre Kenneth Branagh, in the lead role. On the plus side, the cinematography by Changwei Gu (who had earlier shot`Red Sorghum' and `Farewell My Concubine') is superb and the long opening shot of the Savannah River is altogether breathtaking.The film as a whole is certainly well worth a look: dark, shadowy, intriguing and twisty but somehow less than wholly satisfying.
