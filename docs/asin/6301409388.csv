The Movie Starts Off When The Youngest Pound Puppie Whooper Is Telling Two Little Cute Puppies (A Boy And Girl Puppy) A Story Of How Dogs Can Talk To People. Then The Movie Has A Bad Guy In It. And He Takes A Little Of Cute Bulldog Puppies. Then He Turns Them To Be Big And Bad. Then He Tells His Two Henchmen To Get Some Bone From A Big Place. So If You Want To Know What Happens Next. Then Take My Word For It And Buy This Movie. Oh And My Favorite Pound Puppie On Here Is Cooler Because He Rocks!! And He Also Has The Best Ideas. So I Would Like Everyone To Buy This Movie. It's A Must Have For Any Movie Collection.,5,It's Pretty Cool,1120176000,"07 1, 2005",2005,724,"['Pretty', 'Cool', 'Songs', 'Are', 'Way', 'Cool', 'Used', 'Rent', 'Was', 'Blown', 'Away', 'Movie', 'Starts', 'Off', 'When', 'Youngest', 'Pound', 'Puppie', 'Whooper', 'Telling', 'Two', 'Little', 'Cute', 'Puppies', 'Boy', 'Girl', 'Puppy', 'A', 'Story', 'How', 'Dogs', 'Can', 'Talk', 'People', 'Then', 'Movie', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'Little', 'Cute', 'Bulldog', 'Puppies', 'Then', 'Them', 'Be', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Then', 'Two', 'Henchmen', 'Get', 'Bone', 'A', 'Big', 'Place', 'So', 'Want', 'Know', 'What', 'Happens', 'Next', 'Then', 'Take', 'My', 'Word', 'Buy', 'Movie', 'Oh', 'My', 'Favorite', 'Pound', 'Puppie', 'Here', 'Cooler', 'Also', 'Best', 'Ideas', 'Would', 'Everyone', 'Buy', 'Movie', 'Must', 'Have', 'Any', 'Movie', 'Collection']",Pound Puppies Movie Legend of Big Paw VHS
251666,A2582KMXLK2P06,6301409388,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I grew up in the 80's and absolutely LOVED the Pound Puppies!  In fact, as embarrassing as this is to admit since I'm an adult, I still have a pound puppy stuffed animal sitting below my alarm clock on the nightstand (right beside this thing I made in Kindergarden that shows drawings of my absolute favorite things- including pizza and, you guessed it, a dog!  I guess some things never change).Anyway I never could bring myself to get rid of that stuffed animal... he's too adorable!  It was a present for me like, 25 years ago, and I will keep it forever and ever.Anyway this Pound Puppies movie is about as adorable, loveable, and entertaining as you'd imagine.  You'll wish these puppies were real that's for sure!  Not just because of their personality, but the cuteness factor will surely make you want to absorb your soul into their animated bodies.At the very least, if your child ever asks for a real puppy, once you watch Pound Puppies & the Legend of Big Paw, you WILL want to give in and provide your child with his or her very own puppy.  You won't be able to turn away from those happy adorable faces, trust me!",5,"ah, my beloved pound puppy is back!",1334707200,"04 18, 2012",2012,1126,"['grew', 'up', '80', 'absolutely', 'LOVED', 'Pound', 'Puppies', 'fact', 'as', 'embarrassing', 'admit', ""'m"", 'adult', 'still', 'have', 'pound', 'puppy', 'stuffed', 'animal', 'sitting', 'alarm', 'clock', 'nightstand', 'right', 'beside', 'thing', 'made', 'Kindergarden', 'drawings', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'things-', 'including', 'pizza', 'guessed', 'dog', 'guess', 'things', 'never', 'change', '.Anyway', 'never', 'could', 'bring', 'get', 'rid', 'stuffed', 'animal', 'too', 'adorable', 'was', 'present', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'will', 'keep', 'forever', 'ever.Anyway', 'Pound', 'Puppies', 'movie', 'adorable', 'loveable', 'entertaining', ""'d"", 'imagine', ""'ll"", 'wish', 'puppies', 'were', 'real', 'sure', 'Not', 'just', 'personality', 'cuteness', 'factor', 'will', 'surely', 'make', 'want', 'absorb', 'soul', 'animated', 'very', 'least', 'child', 'ever', 'real', 'puppy', 'once', 'watch', 'Pound', 'Puppies', 'Legend', 'Big', 'Paw', 'WILL', 'want', 'give', 'provide', 'child', 'very', 'own', 'puppy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'turn', 'away', 'happy', 'adorable', 'trust']",Pound Puppies Movie Legend of Big Paw VHS

It has nothing to do with the TV series AND the toyline it was base on. The story makes zero sense at all. The animation is choppy & subpar. I seen better animation from TV Funhouse. The songs are awful and make the songs from The Tom & Jerry Movie sound good. The voice acting stinks. It sounds like it was done by a drunk 4 year old.
