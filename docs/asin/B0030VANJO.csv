1315701,A2GPN2VKS8E77C,B0030VANJO,HAMLET,"[7, 7]","I admit, when a relative of mine bought Volume One of this show, I wasn't too enthusiastic about it for some reason. but during the first few minutes of the two-part season premiere, i was intrigued, and by the end of it, I was hooked. My first impression of McPike as a P.I.T.A. (I can't say what that stands for here) didn't wear off until late in Season 3. but i'll take this one season at a time. Ken Wahl gives a magnetic (and award-winning) performance as Vinnie Terrranova, an undercover operative for the OCB, a (fictional) branch of the FBI (Federal Bureau Of Investigation). Jonathan Banks co-stars as McPike, his tough superior with brass marbles, and Jim Byrnes (a real-life amputee who lost his legs 15 years to the day he got the role in Wiseguy; the circumstance in which he lost his legs in real life is explained in an episode) co-stars as Lifeguard, Vinnie's contact person.Season 1: The Sonny Steelgrave story arc was excellent and full of tension, every episode being well-written and the suspense carefully constructed. There were a few scenes in a couple of episodes that were strongly remeniscent of the 1972 classic ""The Godfather."" SPOILER ALERT!!! The arc ended in a different manner than I thought it would, as there's a website that tells you how an arc ends. I thought Sonny would go into his office, and there blow his brains out with the camera cutting away to the wall where some blood splatters just before he pulls the trigger. I think it should have ended that way. but other than that, I thought it was a good arc. SPOILER ALERT OVER!!!The second half of Season 1 was taken up with the Mel Profitt story arc. It was really good, featuring a star-making performance from then unknown stage actor Kevin Spacey as Profitt. Joan Severance also turned in a terrific performance as Mel's sexy sister Susan. But it was all about the really manic performance of Kevin Spacey, which is a forerunner of his Academy Award winning turn in ""The Usual Suspects."" William Russ (Disney's ""Boy Meets World"") also stars.Season 2 begins with a shocker, as Vinnie deals with a white supremacist group. Fred Dalton Thompson and Paul Gilfoyle (""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"") star.Then, he deals with a clothing company threatened by a mobster. Jerry Lewis, Ron Silver and Stanley Tucci star.After that, he...HOLD IT. There's a story arc missing here. Which leaves a loss in continuity with the rest of Season 2, as a recurring character who Vinnie was dating is no longer around (and the final scene of the last episode she appears in has her and Vinnie together in his mom's house, setting up the Christmas tree. The stand-alone episodes sprinkled in Season 2 are quite good. Ken Wahl even gets in on the action, making some white noise. Then, we're launched into a storyline about the Mafia, which is apparently connected to the arc not included in this set. Confusing (since the arc is missing), but quite good. It ends with a bang...literally.Season 3 continues with the shocker that Season 2 concluded on with the Mafia storyline. Terrific, if a bit confusing (and again, some scenes are remeniscent of ""The Godfather""; it's not a put-down, I'm merely noting this).Then, Vinnie is called up to Washington, D.C. seemingly to investigate a plot to counterfeit Japanese yen, but he suspects that there's an even bigger conspiracy brewing...Vinnie then heads up to the state of Washington to smoke out a serial killer. Once again, some things aren't always what they seem. The stakes are even higher here than ever before...Then, Vinnie...wait a minute. Vinnie's not here. What happened? CBS decided they wanted to change the way the series was going, with its to-be-continued storylines, and told co-creater/executive producer Stephen J. Cannell to talk to Ken Wahl about it. But Mr. Wahl (understandably so) did not agree and the dispute got heated, and he walked out and thus was written off the show. Oh...so THAT explains why Vinnie's no longer here. Okay...moving on.Season 4: I have mixed feelings about this season. First off, I don't like that Ken Wahl was written off the show the way he was. They should have had a double play him (seen from the back) and lead into the new character. Seeing Vinnie written off like that would probably have made the audience understand more instead of the writers doing it the way they did (a la ""The Trail Of The Pink Panther,"" where the producers incorporated deleted scenes from the previous movies starring Peter Sellers into the movie to explain why he wasn't in the film, as Sellers died before production began on the movie). Pity too, because the storylines were still going strong, especially the final (unaired) episode, of which there are III included in this ""Collector's Set.""I give the set 4 stars because the Dead Dog Records story arc is not included, thus making the next storyline somewhat confusing and a bit difficult to follow.The series is rated TV-14. Let me address that. The first 10 episodes (in my opinion) are TV-PG, as the language is tame, a majority of the violence is implied rather than shown & what is shown is barely, if at all, graphic, and there's no sexual content (ie. characters making love in bed). Parental Guidance suggested.However, beginning with the Mel Profitt storyline and from then on (minus one or two stand-alone episodes), the episodes are TV-14, as the language gets a little rougher, the violence is a bit more graphic and the sexual content goes up. Viewer Discretion advised.With the above sentence said, I highly recommend this series.",4,"Really, It's 5 Stars, But...",1309478400,"07 1, 2011",2011,5556,"['admit', 'when', 'relative', 'mine',

What good is this ""Collector's Edition"" of ""Wiseguy"" if it's not the complete series? The ""Dead Dog Records"" story arc is crucial to the full impact of the series. I can only imagine how Tim Curry, Glenn Frey and Patti D'Arbanville feel about having their very fine work on this series obliterated. And who can feel good about the erasure of an important role in the career of the late Paul Winfield?If I buy any ""Wiseguy"" DVD set, it probably will be the Complete Season 1, the ""Nights in White Satin"" brouhaha notwithstanding. You still get all the glory of Kevin Spacey, an obvious star in the making, in his proto-Keyser Soze role as Mel Profitt. (William Russ, who was Spacey's equal in the Mel Profitt arc as the wild man Roger Lococco, faded back into supporting roles; it makes you wonder about show business.) And you get all the excitement of Ray Sharkey as Sonny Steelgrave, who would have fit just as handily into ""The Sopranos"" or ""GoodFellas"" as he did in ""Wiseguy."" To see Sharkey is to feel all the sorrow of watching a wasted life and talent; instead of the star career he should have had, Sharkey ended up in a junkie's early grave.To watch ""Wiseguy"" again after nearly a quarter-century is to marvel at how little it has dated, the pay phones and toned-down language notwithstanding. This is a show that still has snap, verve, and excitement, largely because the characters and the actors who play them are so exciting. Ken Wahl still cuts a charismatic figure as Vinnie Terranova; it's a tragedy that a combination of inner demons and physical calamities forced him out of acting. Jonathan Banks, as the surly, smart-mouthed McPike, could have taught even Dennis Franz a thing or two about being a great curmudgeonly cop. And Jim Byrnes was always a joy to watch as Lifeguard; his presence begs the question as to why Hollywood still lags behind so shamefully in hiring disabled actors.Anyway, I love ""Wiseguy,"" and I look forward to the day when someone ponies up the dough to produce a REAL DVD set of the complete series.",3,"I LOVE this show, but...",1310428800,"07 12, 2011",2011,2212,"['When', 'found', 'out', 'producers', 'DVD', 'set', 'excised', 'Dead', 'Dog', 'Records', 'episodes', 'disputes', 'music', 'royalties', 'interest', 'fell', 'nearly', 'zero', 'What', 'good', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Wiseguy', 'not', 'complete', 'series', 'Dead', 'Dog', 'Records', 'story', 'arc', 'crucial', 'full', 'impact', 'series', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Glenn', 'Frey', 'Patti', ""D'Arbanville"", 'feel', 'having', 'very', 'fine', 'work', 'series', 'obliterated', 'who', 'can', 'feel', 'good', 'erasure', 'important', 'role', 'career', 'late', 'Paul', 'Winfield', 'buy', 'Wiseguy', 'DVD', 'set', 'probably', 'will', 'be', 'Complete', 'Season', '1', 'Nights', 'White', 'Satin', 'brouhaha', 'notwithstanding', 'still', 'get', 'glory', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'obvious', 'star', 'making', 'proto-Keyser', 'Soze', 'role', 'Mel', 'Profitt', 'William', 'Russ', 'who', 'was', 'Spacey', 'equal', 'Mel', 'Profitt', 'arc', 'wild', 'man', 'Roger', 'Lococco', 'faded', 'back', 'supporting', 'roles', 'wonder', 'show', 'business', 'get', 'excitement', 'Ray', 'Sharkey', 'Sonny', 'Steelgrave', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'just', 'handily', 'Sopranos', 'GoodFellas', 'did', 'Wiseguy', 'see', 'Sharkey', 'feel', 'sorrow', 'watching', 'wasted', 'life', 'talent', 'instead', 'star', 'career', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'Sharkey', 'ended', 'up', 'junkie', 'early', 'grave.To', 'watch', 'Wiseguy', 'again', 'nearly', 'quarter-century', 'marvel', 'how', 'little', 'dated', 'pay', 'phones', 'toned-down', 'language', 'notwithstanding', 'show', 'still', 'snap', 'verve', 'excitement', 'largely', 'characters', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'are', 'so', 'exciting', 'Ken', 'Wahl', 'still', 'charismatic', 'figure', 'Vinnie', 'Terranova', 'tragedy', 'combination', 'inner', 'demons', 'physical', 'calamities', 'forced', 'acting', 'Jonathan', 'Banks', 'surly', 'smart-mouthed', 'McPike', 'could', 'have', 'taught', 'even', 'Dennis', 'Franz', 'thing', 'two', 'being', 'great', 'curmudgeonly', 'cop', 'Jim', 'Byrnes', 'was', 'always', 'joy', 'watch', 'Lifeguard', 'presence', 'question', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'still', 'so', 'shamefully', 'hiring', 'disabled', 'actors.Anyway', 'love', 'Wiseguy', 'look', 'forward', 'day', 'when', 'someone', 'up', 'dough', 'produce', 'REAL', 'DVD', 'set', 'complete', 'series']",Wiseguy: Seasons 1- 4

The other guy (name?) was ok but the point is that I am really annoyed that all three shows ended up the last l-l/2 or 2 seasons with someone other than the main star. The stories are great; action is terrific and all the players are believable BUT to see the main star gone is really maddening and it happened on all three shows. grrrrrrrrrrrrr.
