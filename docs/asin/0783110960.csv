My brother ended up convincing me to watch this movie, and I was amazed at how much I liked it. This movie was made before 9/11, and the original FBI investigators were consulted when this movie was made so it would be accurate. The terrorist training tapes that are seen in this film are real, too.For most of this movie, you would think it was comical if not true. There were so many close calls for these terrorists while they were planning the attack, they had the police and FBI on them a lot, but because of laws (many made during the Clinton era) they ended up being protected rather than prosecuted.I completely recommend this movie! It is informative and fascinating; it moves quickly and keeps the watcher captivated. It is sad, because this attack did go forward (even though not as planned) and people died - but it is an important part about American history that we need to know and remember.I am also disturbed/intrigued by the last line of the movie. One of the terrorists is arrested and looks at the World Trade Centers. He says something like ""the next time, they will both go down."" The terror attacks of September 11th, 2001 took years to plan. I think he knew.Tagline: No one expected a terrorist attack on U.S. soil. But many could have prevented it.Rent it, buy it, just make sure you watch this movie!!!",5,Unsuspected Favorite,1184198400,"07 12, 2007",2007,1452,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'flat', 'refused', 'watch', 'movie', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'US', 'Too', 'ugly', 'too', 'painful', 'too', 'real', 'brother', 'ended', 'up', 'convincing', 'watch', 'movie', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '9/11', 'original', 'FBI', 'investigators', 'were', 'consulted', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'would', 'be', 'accurate', 'terrorist', 'training', 'tapes', 'are', 'seen', 'film', 'are', 'real', 'most', 'movie', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'comical', 'not', 'true', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'close', 'calls', 'terrorists', 'were', 'planning', 'attack', 'had', 'police', 'FBI', 'lot', 'laws', 'many', 'made', 'Clinton', 'era', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'protected', 'rather', 'prosecuted.I', 'completely', 'recommend', 'movie', 'informative', 'fascinating', 'quickly', 'watcher', 'captivated', 'sad', 'attack', 'did', 'go', 'forward', 'even', 'though', 'not', 'planned', 'people', 'died', 'important', 'part', 'American', 'history', 'need', 'know', 'remember.I', 'am', 'also', 'disturbed/intrigued', 'last', 'line', 'movie', 'One', 'terrorists', 'arrested', 'World', 'Trade', 'Centers', 'something', 'next', 'time', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'terror', 'attacks', 'September', '11th', '2001', 'took', 'years', 'plan', 'think', 'one', 'expected', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'U.S.', 'soil', 'many', 'could', 'have', 'prevented', 'it.Rent', 'buy', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', 'movie']",Path to Paradise - The Untold Story of the World Trade Center Bombing VHS
42462,A3E7ZFQNJ47XB7,0783110960,Brooser Bear,"[10, 17]","This is a competent docudrama of how a terrorist cell managed to slip past the US authorities and set off an explosion in the World Tade Center. Unfortunately the film is too simplistic and does not delve into more complex issues beyond showing that the FBI screwed up.The arab actors have created dynamite performances to avoid stereotypes, however the script has oversimplified and reduced to jingoism the ideology that drives the Islamist extremists. The Blind Cleric is also a mere shadow of himself, as anyone who read any of his interviews will see for themselves. Nothing is said of how the war in Afghanistan has created these terrorists, nor of the conflict in Egypt out of which they came. The viewer does not get the sense of the volatile and explosive cauldron that is the revolutionary Middle East, nor of the US involvement in it.Perhaps it is too much to ask from a made for cable film, but the audience is none the wiser as to why and how after seeing the film. Other than that the actors portraying the terrorists electrify the film and offer a wry commentary on the civil liberties in the American society.",3,SIMPLISTIC RECREATION OF A DISASTER,1005091200,"11 7, 2001",2001,1124,"['competent', 'docudrama', 'how', 'terrorist', 'cell', 'managed', 'slip', 'US', 'authorities', 'set', 'off', 'explosion', 'World', 'Tade', 'Center', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'too', 'simplistic', 'not', 'delve', 'more', 'complex', 'issues', 'showing', 'FBI', 'screwed', 'up.The', 'arab', 'actors', 'have', 'created', 'dynamite', 'performances', 'avoid', 'stereotypes', 'however', 'script', 'oversimplified', 'reduced', 'jingoism', 'ideology', 'Islamist', 'extremists', 'Blind', 'Cleric', 'also', 'mere', 'shadow', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'interviews', 'will', 'see', 'Nothing', 'said', 'how', 'war', 'Afghanistan', 'created', 'terrorists', 'conflict', 'Egypt', 'came', 'viewer', 'not', 'get', 'sense', 'volatile', 'explosive', 'cauldron', 'revolutionary', 'Middle', 'East', 'US', 'involvement', 'it.Perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'made', 'cable', 'film', 'audience', 'none', 'wiser', 'why', 'how', 'seeing', 'film', 'Other', 'actors', 'portraying', 'terrorists', 'electrify', 'film', 'offer', 'wry', 'commentary', 'civil', 'liberties', 'American', 'society']",Path to Paradise - The Untold Story of the World Trade Center Bombing VHS

After the WTC bombing, he returned for the deposit on the Ryder truck that they exploded in the WTC basement.But the most sobering moment of the movie, is at the end.
