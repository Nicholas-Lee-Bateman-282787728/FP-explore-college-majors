In this film, he portrays Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the years between the onset of polio and his return to politics. I've never heard this part of his bio before, and it's quite interesting.The plot must be somewhat simplistic, since it compresses much into 100 minutes, but that doesn't make it a bad plot or a bad movie. Knowing what little I do of FDR's later history gives depth and meaning to this formative part of his life.Again, I recommend this one.

Part of the reason I thought that was the picture. It is supposed to be Eleanor, but Eleanor Roosevelt neither looked nor spoke the way she was portrayed in this film. Her spirit, however, was evident.While the series ""Franklin and Eleanor"" was more about Eleanor, this one is more about Franklin and his struggle with polio. Eleanor, having been humiliated by Franklin, who only decided to stay with her because otherwise he would lose his trust fund, stays with him faithfully. When he is diagnosed with polio, she honorably steps in to support, encourage, and finally to stand in for Franklin when he was discouraged, depressed, and too ill to even consider politics. They learned from each other. He, a spoiled, privileged, mama's boy used to getting anything and everything he wanted learned compassion and sensitivity from what he saw around him as he battled polio. He traveled to Warm Springs, Georgia where he got to know and love people who were so poor they couldn't put food on the table at times. Those who were afflicted with polio as he was couldn't afford medical treatment. The story takes place as his eyes are opened to real pain and poverty and has to fight to get them the help they needed.Franklin is depressed, feeling sorry for himself until the physical therapist, masterfully portrayed by Kathy Bates, puts things in perspective for him. That scene is worthy of an award, where she explains to him he has had a marriage, a wife, children, a successful career. Some of the other patients never have had those things and never will.After recognizing the terrible situation and making a commitment to help, he fought to use his own personal trust, sold valuable artwork and other possessions at a time when there were few buyers, and then discovered his most powerful weapon and intellectual equal, Eleanor, to convince the medical community of the value of treatment centers such as Warm Springs. There was one scene that brought me to tears when I hadn't really thought this would be an emotional movie. It related to other polio victims struggling to walk. In another scene, the medical community will have nothing to do with Franklin. He asks to speak at their convention and they refuse him. When Eleanor visits Warm Springs and sees what he's up against, she suggests they crash the convention. With Eleanor at his side and in his corner, the rest is history.

Sarah Roosevelt was much more shrewish than is shown here, and the point could well have been made that she spoiled her only child outrageously, giving him a huge self-confidence that could be shaken only temporarily. Moreover, relations between Eleanor and Franklin, at the film's conclusion, were not quite that warm.  In fact, Franklin died at Warm Springs in the company of his mistress of the 1920s.  Later, Eleanor worked for left wing causes and indulged in lesbianism.  I know, I know...why spoil a lovely tale that's mostly true?

913301,A1YYBC3O7KHQKK,B0009UVBI6,Carter,"[1, 1]","That this story about THE pivotal period in the life of a famous and privileged man turns out to be the story of an ordinary individual confronting difficult circumstances faced by other ordinary individuals, and finding a path forward, is what is so impressive about both the film and the man.  Let's not mince words:  Warm Springs is the story of an ordinary man's recovery from depression and the example he sets for others to follow.  These biographical dramas always have a tough road to hoe and usually bite off too much, relying on formulas in an effort to tell too much story in too little time.  Warm Springs strictly avoids that mistake and instead focuses on a fulcrum period in FDR's evolution into the man the world would come to know--simultaneously vulnerable and masterful.  It's fortunate that most people will never know the depth of despair that often comes with a premature loss of health, physical vitality, and sexual vigor.  Roosevelt may have come from the ranks of the elite, but he wasn't immune to that despair.  And though he finds himself deep in a black hole (what friend and fellow depressive Winston Churchill called his own ""Black Dog""), he eventually--slowly, gradually, incrementally, as it is for most people--pulls himself out.  Sargent's film draws us into that slow and gradual process but always maintains our attention with a poignant, intelligent screenplay and stand-out performances, particularly Branagh's.  ""So,"" you might ask, ""If FDR had such a great recovery example to set for the rest of us, why didn't he write a 'self-help' book!!?""  Well, he did.  Check out You Learn By Living and other works by Eleanor Roosevelt.  Historians have only occasionally documented this period of FDR's life, and I don't believe any of that work is as compelling and visceral as this film.  Viktor Frankl wrote in Man's Search For Meaning that a person finds happiness by doing something he likes, loving someone, and learning to deal with suffering.  In Georgia, FDR finds a new community of people and an egalitarianism he becomes personally committed to.  Though he spends much of this period apart from his wife, the endurance of their marriage seems to grow into something central to each spouse's identity.  And it is in Georgia that he deals painstakingly with his suffering--the reckoning, the recovery, the personal growth--and is enriched by the transformative power of that pain.

FDR's controlling mother Sara, his personal advisor Louis Howe also got equal commendation for being people who molded FDR's career.Although Kenneth Branagh is not physically convincing as FDR, he does work the emotional side of the man quite well, and Cynthis Nixon does a surprisingly good Eleanor that provides a strong base for this movie.There is a lot here in this production that is important to the Roosevelts.  They are both initially snobby New Yorkers turned off by southern squalor.  Dirt roads and plentiful black servants to their beck and call also takes some getting used to.  Louis Howe is thirsty for his share of power and always thinks of FDR's political career first.  But equally important is Eleanor's getting used to her husband's (long-standing) affair with Lucy Mercer, an affair that is downplayed in this rendition.  Howe  is there to provide guidance for Eleanor as well, and develops in her a confident and strong woman who works feverishly for the rights of women, children and the poor.Tom Nelson and Kathy Bates also give outstanding performances in this HBO movie, although both only appear in about a third of the movie.Even the pools of Warm Springs look genuine.This is not a political-oriented movie by any means.  This is about FDR getting used to being inflicted with permanent paralysis and for him making polio victims no longer victims, but contributing members of a discriminating society.  He learns to overcome his physical handicap through his determination and the hard work of everyone around him.

Kenneth Branagh gives a splendid performance as FDR who while being groomed for high office is struck down by polio at age 39. While at a broken down spa in the backwoods of Georgia he surveys the beautiful properties and decides to purchase it. Tom Loyless the spa's ailing manager (portrayed by Tim Blake Nelson) does not see FDR's dream. Still, it is at Warm Springs where FDR begins his journey into recovery.After being plunged into the pit of despair, FDR comes to terms with his affliction and his recovery inspires Eleanor to invite others to experience the mineral-rich `warm' waters that heal. Warm Springs becomes an oasis to other polio-inflicted paraplegics who inspire FDR in turn. And with the encouragement of his motivated physical therapist (Kathy Bates), Elliot his son, and his wife Eleanor (portrayed admirably by Cynthia Nixon) FDR makes enough progress to re-embark on his political campaign.It is perhaps his affliction that inspired FDR to become the strong, influential person who saw this country through most of World War II and the Great Depression. Such a man, who stood by his New Deal and ignited faith in so many others, demands our admiration. This is well portrayed in the movie and it is the convincing performances of the actors as well as its message of love for family and heralding of FDR's faith in all that he believes that makes this a heartwarming film.",5,"Heartwarming, Impressive, Riveting",1199404800,"01 4, 2008",2008,1545,"['Warm', 'Springs', 'historical', 'drama', 'viewer', 'insight', 'life', 'times', 'glorious', 'age', 'President', 'Franklin', 'Delano', 'Roosevelt', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'splendid', 'performance', 'FDR', 'who', 'being', 'groomed', 'high', 'office', 'struck', 'down', 'polio', 'age', '39', 'broken', 'down', 'spa', 'backwoods', 'Georgia', 'surveys', 'beautiful', 'properties', 'decides', 'purchase', 'Tom', 'Loyless', 'spa', 'ailing', 'manager', 'portrayed', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'not', 'see', 'FDR', 'dream', 'Still', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'where', 'FDR', 'journey', 'recovery.After', 'being', 'plunged', 'pit', 'despair', 'FDR', 'terms', 'affliction', 'recovery', 'inspires', 'Eleanor', 'invite', 'others', 'experience', 'mineral-rich', 'warm', 'waters', 'heal', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'oasis', 'other', 'polio-inflicted', 'paraplegics', 'who', 'inspire', 'FDR', 'turn', 'encouragement', 'motivated', 'physical', 'therapist', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Elliot', 'son', 'wife', 'Eleanor', 'portrayed', 'admirably', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'FDR', 'enough', 'progress', 're-embark', 'political', 'campaign.It', 'perhaps', 'affliction', 'inspired', 'FDR', 'become', 'strong', 'influential', 'person', 'who', 'saw', 'country', 'most', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Great', 'Depression', 'man', 'who', 'stood', 'New', 'Deal', 'ignited', 'faith', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'admiration', 'well', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'convincing', 'performances', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'message', 'love', 'family', 'heralding', 'FDR', 'faith', 'heartwarming', 'film']",N/A

The standard portrayal has been FDR as leader during a critical financial crisis and the commander and chief during WWII. This film steps beyond the crucial period of FDR's life when he contracted polio and lost the use of his legs.FDR always drove himself and perhaps never harder to date than when he was looking for a cure for his lack of mobility. He ventured out to a run down hotel in a backwoods sort of place Warm Springs GA to seek the warm waters and a possible cure for his paralysis. If FDR later became known as a 'traitor to his class' this was no doubt the defining moment in his life which was patrician in upbringing. Illness and infirmity is not class exclusive. Warm Springs became emblematic of an awakening of sorts for FDR and what he took away was not a cure but an awakening to the needs of the common man and those disenfranchised and suffering members of society who had been marginalized and ignored. What FDR learned about the needs of human beings and his burgeoning sense of compassion and understanding came from what he saw there.I really liked this film for  lots of reasons. The acting was first rate. Kenneth Brannaugh was very believeable as FDR from his speech and vocal patterns to the contorted and presumably withered legs. Cynthia Nixon was wonderful as Eleanor Roosevelt, as were the rest of the cast which included Kathy Bates, Tim Nelson Blake, David Paymer, Jane Alexander, and lesser known actors. The script for this film was beautiful in its simplicity and dramatic effect. I really felt like I was a fly on the wall watching all of this roll out.

Cynthia Nixon nearly steals the show.  Her portrayal of Eleanor Roosevelt rivals that of Branagh's and in some scenes she outshines him.  Paymer, Bates, Tim Blake Nelson, and Alexander all weigh in with very strong supporting performances, as do most of the rest of the cast.  This fine dramatic film succeeds by deftly weaving the political and personal events of the Roosevelts' lives and careers during the late 1920s and early 1930s.  By the time the film reaches its dramatic conclusion, viewers will have glimpsed some of FDR's and Eleanor's most formative life experiences -- those which surely enabled him to be ""the right man in the right place"" during some of our nation's most crucial times and her to be one of the world's leading humanitarians of the 20th century.

WARM SPRINGS is the film that shows how they fought back that urge and conquered their fears to become two of the greatest Americans.  The film garners some of the best acting I've witnessed from lead actors and supporting actors as well, but the main highlight of this piece is the story.  The story is one that will remain with me for many years to come because it depicts the time in this couple's life that prepared them to lead America through the Great Depression as well as World War II.  The world needed men and women of courage and stamina to defeat the likes of Hitler and because of what happened to them here no one had more courage and stamina than Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt.The picture we see of Franklin as the film begins is one of a rich, spoiled, self absorbed man who is in an extra-marital affair.  He and Eleanor are on the verge of separating.  It's 1920 and his star is on the rise politically.  It seems to be fear of committing political suicide that prevents that breakup.  Eleanor at first is a shy traditional wife who is afraid of crowds, who resists the opportunity at every turn to help boost her husband's career.Fate intervenes and Franklin contracts a devastating case of polio, and it seems at first that his political career is over.  But, he receives a letter from a man in Warm Springs, Georgia who runs a place where polio victims can swim in the near 90 degree spring water and receive therapy to build up their leg muscles.  It's here that Franklin again finds a mission for himself; here that he sees people who were born under much less fortunate circumstances than himself.  In spite of being victims of polio or their caretakers, these less fortunate men and women create a community of people who truly care for each other.  Franklin learns at Warm Springs to be compassionate.  Back in New York, Eleanor supports her husband by keeping his name in the political fray.  She becomes an activist and makes speeches and demonstrates for the downtrodden.  She learns in his absence to be strong and as a result grows into a truly political asset.After this experience, this couple not only loved each other, they respected and revered each other as well.",5,Enlightening Story,1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,2317,"['anyone', 'ever', 'had', 'legitimate', 'reason', 'giving', 'up', 'political', 'career', 'was', 'Franklin', 'Eleanor', 'Roosevelt', 'WARM', 'SPRINGS', 'film', 'how', 'fought', 'back', 'urge', 'conquered', 'fears', 'become', 'two', 'greatest', 'Americans', 'film', 'garners', 'best', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'witnessed', 'lead', 'actors', 'supporting', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'main', 'highlight', 'piece', 'story', 'story', 'one', 'will', 'remain', 'many', 'years', 'come', 'time', 'couple', 'life', 'prepared', 'lead', 'America', 'Great', 'Depression', 'as', 'well', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'world', 'needed', 'men', 'women', 'courage', 'stamina', 'defeat', 'likes', 'Hitler', 'what', 'happened', 'here', 'one', 'had', 'more', 'courage', 'stamina', 'Franklin', 'Eleanor', 'Roosevelt.The', 'picture', 'see', 'Franklin', 'film', 'one', 'rich', 'spoiled', 'absorbed', 'man', 'who', 'extra-marital', 'affair', 'Eleanor', 'are', 'verge', 'separating', '1920', 'star', 'rise', 'politically', 'be', 'fear', 'committing', 'political', 'suicide', 'breakup', 'Eleanor', 'first', 'shy', 'traditional', 'wife', 'who', 'afraid', 'crowds', 'who', 'opportunity', 'turn', 'help', 'boost', 'husband', 'career.Fate', 'intervenes', 'Franklin', 'contracts', 'devastating', 'case', 'polio', 'first', 'political', 'career', 'letter', 'man', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'Georgia', 'who', 'place', 'where', 'polio', 'victims', 'can', 'swim', 'near', '90', 'degree', 'spring', 'water', 'receive', 'therapy', 'build', 'up', 'leg', 'muscles', 'here', 'Franklin', 'again', 'mission', 'here', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'born', 'much', 'less', 'fortunate', 'circumstances', 'spite', 'being', 'victims', 'polio', 'caretakers', 'less', 'fortunate', 'men', 'women', 'create', 'community', 'people', 'who', 'truly', 'care', 'other', 'Franklin', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'be', 'compassionate', 'Back', 'New', 'York', 'Eleanor', 'husband', 'keeping', 'name', 'political', 'fray', 'activist', 'speeches', 'demonstrates', 'downtrodden', 'absence', 'be', 'strong', 'result', 'truly', 'political', 'asset.After', 'experience', 'couple', 'not', 'only', 'loved', 'other', 'respected', 'revered', 'other', 'as', 'well']",N/A

I also use as a text, ""Profiles in Leadership from Caesar to Modern Times.""  I wrote the book.  This movie inspired me. It showed the marvelous strength of Eleanor and Franklin and their boundless determination to change the world.

It dwells on the concept of being able to ""lead ourselves"" before we lead others.  The essence of the book is the Leadership Secrets, Leadership Traits, Leadership Lessons and Words of Wisdom of several famous leaders: Julius Caesar, Augustus, Napoleon, Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Eleanor Roosevelt, Margaret Thatcher and Oprah Winfrey.  Each faced challenges and taught us life long leadership lessons that are as fresh today as they were when they led others. They give us insights that we can use at this moment and every moment.  The book is designed to be a compass and road map for leaders of all ages.The longest chapter in the book is about Eleanor Roosevelt.

913313,A1RYZI8WC4OA69,B0009UVBI6,GM,"[1, 1]","Very simple summary of the story: This is the tale of FDR, prior to becoming one of the greatest presidents of the United States, and how he came to terms with the disease he  carried.  Kenneth Branagh, having played Hamlet previously, is qualified to play FDR, and does so with touching respect. One can imagine FDR looking down and saying ""Way to go Kenneth!"" Cynthia Nixon, a well-known HBO alumni, plays Eleanor, likewise one of USA's greatest first ladies. Kathy Bates is not the waitress that serves FDR and his boatmen in an early scene, although that girl looks similar. She plays a Physical Therapist, whose aversion to despair might have inspired some new deal policies. This is a fine cast. You might also recognize David Paymer, who does a good job and is probably one of hollywood's more unsupported supporting men.This movie is inspiring, a look at the crafting of leadership potential that would deliver America out of one of it's darkest decades. It's a look at FDR I found enlightening. Four years prior to being president, FDR wasn't a rabid politico, in the vein of a Clinton or a Bush. He was more accurately something of a hospital owner and a wounded healer himself. Likewise fascinating is the foreshadowing of the civil rights movement during a period of time America is a bit too preoccupied to deal with race. It's fascinated to see diseased people complain of stigma, be physically lifted, served, and pushed by black men, and basically ignore fountains that discriminate based on skin tone. The more I look back on the movie, the more intentional these quirks in the setting seem. The focus, however, is leadership, and how it's forged from adversity.The film does paint a bit too much of a favorable picture of FDR though.  He was a great president, but the movie seems to present his love life in a sort of redemptive arc, which was not the case in the real world. The mistress early in the movie is phased out by the narrative, making way for a mutually respectful husband-wife relationship. In real life, the mistress was with FDR as he died, one of many holidays from the marriage. The relationship was so cold some hypothesized that Eleanor was a lesbian. The media is likewise given a raw deal. The media is portrayed as opportunistic in this movie, while in reality, FDR knew how to use the media, and the media was gentlemanly in their non-publicizing of FDR's condition.This is a moving movie, and it had me close to tears at some points. How I wish we had presidents like this today!

But until that happens the news of the release of the DVD should allow those who missed this phenomenal film to feel greeted with well-earned joy.Writer Margaret Nagle and Director Joseph Sargent have created an isolated time in the life of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the inception of his polio at age 39 and the treatment of his impairment at Warm Springs, Georgia, and use this potential tragedy to demonstrate how a man of means and high political aspirations was humbled by a debilitating disease only to find healing and consolation at the hands of 'the common people', a change in his priorities that marked his popular success as a President who inherited the leadership of a country devastated by depression and war.Kenneth Branagh is superlative as FDR, finding just the right amount of bravado and churlishness and womanizing while continuing to be the man of great potential and a loving husband to Eleanor (a surprisingly terrific Cynthia Nixon).  His overbearing mother Sara Delano Roosevelt (Jane Alexander who is still remembered as a perfect 'Eleanor' in the older 'Franklin and Eleanor') tries her best to belittle Eleanor, only to enhance Eleanor's blossoming into the world respected, humanistic First Lady she became.But much of the action is aptly placed at the healing resort of Warm Springs, a run down hot springs operated by Tom Loyless (Tim Blake Nelson) and the place where Helena Mahoney (Kathy Bates) nursed FDR back to health.  The importance of this spot grows through the film and through FDR's life and in the end it is the beneficiary of his estate.Watching Branagh tumble from political barnstormer to reluctant patient to humanized President is a heartwarming venture.  His supporting cast is excellent - Bates, Nixon, Alexander, Nelson as well as David Paymer, Deborah Calloway Duke, Danny Connell, and many others.  The direction by  Joseph Sargent is one of simplicity, purity of purpose, and highly respectful of his story and his view of history.  This is an important film.  Highly Recommended.

Franklin must face the fact he is a paraplegic at Warm Springs in the backwoods of Georgia surrounded by poverty and racism the likes of which he had never imagined. Eleanor, too must find her identity without her husband. Their parallel journeys brings them back together as real friends. All the actors are brilliant.

You don't expect a musical number in WARM SPRINGS, which basically outlines the struggles of FDR to find his humanity after a crippling outbreak of polio robs him of the use of his limbs.  He stumbles upon a rundown ramshackle lodge in rural Georgia which boasts extra magnesium in its waters, and extremely high temperature waters, and he decides to give it a try to see if he can walk again.After he gives an interview syndicated around the country, endorsing the healing powers of Warm Springs, the hotel finds itself besieged by polio victims, and its regular clientele threaten a boycott.  Obviously this segment of the film will remind viewers of a certain age of the hysteria atound AIDS and HIV, for the swimmers refuse to use the same pool as FDR and his friends, even though medical science tells them that after the fever has broken, polio sufferers are no longer contagious.  Eventually the numbers swell and the entire hotel is run for the benefit of the convalescent.  That's where Felicia Day comes in, as a dancer who cab;t quite cover up some ugly looking scars on her right wrist.  Apparently she has tried suicide before, since dancing was all she knows.  Can the merry and healing spirit of Warm Springs help her despair?The answer comes in a climactic and suspenseful ""musicale"" organized by the hotel residents themselves.

913325,A2460ZRFVC2YGV,B0009UVBI6,Kristopher Haines,"[14, 19]","I rented ""Warm Springs"" precisely because it promised to showcase FDR's battle with the effects of polio. This was a part of FDR's life that was kept largely hidden for many years, and ""Warm Springs"" greatest achievement is to show us why. There's the brilliant scene of the boy in the baggage car and the banning of FDR and the other patients from the dining area of the Warm Springs resort. It showed the fear and bewilderment of the public in the face of this largely misunderstood disease.That part needed to be shown, but ""Warm Springs"" poses a much more interesting question by its very existence. We have clearly moved beyond the time when we regarded polio with hysterical fear, it is my understanding that polio has been all but wiped out. (Not completely, I went to school with a Mexican immigrant who wasn't vaccinated and contracted it.) The bigger question is have we moved beyond the ""pity and revoulsion"" that came with handicap at the time? In other words, if FDR lived today and made every appearance in a wheelchair would the public elect him multiple times, or at all? Take for instance the case of George Wallace, it wasn't his dark past as a staunch segregationist that cost him his later political career, but rather that an aide dropped Wallace while boarding a plane.The conservative wheelchair-using columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote an interesting OP-ED on the FDR memorial in D.C. In it, Krauthammer argues against the stautue of FDR in a chair. It is interesting to note that like FDR, Krauthammer makes an effort to hide his disability. (There's no sign of a chair in the photo that accompanies his byline.) We only know he's in a chair when he sounds off on a disability-rights issue. As a disabled American I would have to disagree with Krauthammer, I think it is very important to have things like this film and that monument to show the world that a person with a disability ran this country for more years than anyone in history and through many of its toughest times. I look forward to a day when people with disabilities will never again hide their disabilities because disability is looked upon with neither pity nor admiration but instead viewed as hardly worthy of comment.",4,Hidden History,1125878400,"09 5, 2005",2005,2214,"['rented', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'precisely', 'promised', 'showcase', 'FDR', 'battle', 'effects', 'polio', 'was', 'part', 'FDR', 'life', 'was', 'kept', 'largely', 'hidden', 'many', 'years', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'greatest', 'achievement', 'show', 'why', 'brilliant', 'scene', 'boy', 'baggage', 'car', 'banning', 'FDR', 'other', 'patients', 'dining', 'area', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'resort', 'showed', 'fear', 'bewilderment', 'public', 'face', 'largely', 'misunderstood', 'part', 'needed', 'be', 'shown', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'question', 'very', 'existence', 'have', 'clearly', 'moved', 'time', 'when', 'regarded', 'polio', 'hysterical', 'fear', 'understanding', 'polio', 'been', 'wiped', 'out', 'Not', 'completely', 'went', 'school', 'Mexican', 'immigrant', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'vaccinated', 'contracted', 'bigger', 'question', 'have', 'moved', 'pity', 'revoulsion', 'came', 'handicap', 'time', 'other', 'words', 'FDR', 'lived', 'today', 'made', 'appearance', 'wheelchair', 'would', 'public', 'elect', 'multiple', 'times', 'Take', 'instance', 'case', 'George', 'Wallace', 'was', ""n't"", 'dark', 'past', 'staunch', 'segregationist', 'cost', 'later', 'political', 'career', 'rather', 'aide', 'dropped', 'Wallace', 'boarding', 'plane.The', 'conservative', 'wheelchair-using', 'columnist', 'Charles', 'Krauthammer', 'wrote', 'interesting', 'OP-ED', 'FDR', 'memorial', 'D.C', 'Krauthammer', 'stautue', 'FDR', 'chair', 'interesting', 'note', 'FDR', 'Krauthammer', 'effort', 'hide', 'disability', 'sign', 'chair', 'photo', 'byline', 'only', 'know', 'chair', 'when', 'off', 'disability-rights', 'issue', 'disabled', 'American', 'would', 'have', 'disagree', 'Krauthammer', 'think', 'very', 'important', 'have', 'things', 'film', 'monument', 'show', 'world', 'person', 'disability', 'ran', 'country', 'more', 'years', 'anyone', 'history', 'many', 'toughest', 'times', 'look', 'forward', 'day', 'when', 'people', 'disabilities', 'will', 'never', 'again', 'hide', 'disabilities', 'disability', 'looked', 'pity', 'admiration', 'instead', 'viewed', 'hardly', 'comment']",N/A

This is common knowledge today. What is not known, and truly should be, is the struggle he undertook first to cope with, then to master, the disability that would ordinarily have torpedoed his career. Generally underappreciated as an actor, Kenneth Branagh, turns in a brilliant performance in his portrayal of an FDR never really glimpsed before - broken, bitter, depressed, then increasingly hopeful and courageous, and finally, triumphant. Toward the end of this movie, when asked if polio has changed her husband, Eleanor as acted by Cynthia Nixon smiles and says emphatically, ""Oh yes... it has.""An argument can be made that polio made Roosevelt. His quest to walk again brought him into contact with people he would never have otherwise met. Good people of all races, classes, and age. It opened his eyes to the needs of his countrymen, and made him as compassionate as any wildly successful politician can be. Franklin and Eleanor, though their marriage was far from perfect, grew together into America's first power couple. No longer the arrogant, detached rich boy, he went on to become one of America's greatest presidents in one of America's most trying eras, and she one of America's most influential women.

913330,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0009UVBI6,Robert Moore,"[5, 5]","Along with Lincoln, FDR is far and away my favorite president.  I love them above all for theThe film has a number of historical inaccuracies.  For instance, Roosevelt specified the design of the car he drove and it was not a surprise gift, tough as all biographies recount, he was an atrocious, very fast driver who terrified all who rode with him.  The driving was, however, crucial in his development as a person because in driving around the larger area around Warm Springs, he gained a vastly deeper insight into the lives of poor, rural Americans.  Early in the film he tells Louis Howe, with no intended irony, that he is a man of the people.  That would eventually be true, but it was almost entirely because of what he learned in overcoming his polio and getting to know the people of rural Georgia.  The scene where FDR is seen talking to a number of people surrounding his car as Eleanor rides away in the train corresponds to many accounts of his time in Georgia.  Although Franklin had a serious problem with intimacy in relationships, he excelled in casual encounters with people and had an easy familiarity with casual strangers.The worst historical inaccuracy is the depiction of Louis Howe.  It is pretty much a travesty.  All biographers agree that no one did more for FDR following his polio affliction than Howe.  No one spent more time with him working directly with him on his rehabilitation.  The film suggests that Howe was somewhat remote from him during these years.  The truth is that he was the major presence in both Franklin and Eleanor's life.  As was Missy Lehand.  Where was she?  She makes a token appearance, but she went from playing a minor role in his life in his law firm after leaving the Department of the Navy to being a major addition.  She even went on boat trips with him.  It was Howe who worked with FDR in his technique for appearing to be able to walk on braces while leaning on someone's arm.  David Paymer did a credible job as Howe, though he was vastly too good looking for the role.  Howe liked to describe himself as the ugliest man in America and good photos tend to bear this out.  The film also somewhat exaggerates Eleanor's role in these years.  She was crucial later as his representative to the rest of the world, but that came later.  It also hints that things were a tad more affectionate between them than all accounts indicate that they were.  I've not read any accounts that Eleanor was a major presence during his learning to ""walk,"" though Louis definitely was.  And it is true that he preferred to use Eliot in his walks, though James was also pressed into service.Some of the things the film gets accurately are that FDR did spend almost all of his financial assets in buying Warm Springs.  I also like that they hinted as his absolutely atrocious cocktails, which everyone agreed were undrinkable though irrefusable.  Cocktail hour during his White House years was an essential daily ritual.  The dreadfulness of his carefully made cocktails came, it is reported, from his heavy use of vermouth and his light use of gin.  To make things worse, he used very poor gin.But all and all I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  Much of it was filmed on location, either in Warm Springs or in Hyde Park.  Even though he returned to active political life after his nominating speech for Al Smith in 1924, he continually returned to Warm Springs for the rest of his life.  He went there with Lucy Mercer in 1945 and died there after a brain aneurysm.  he always saw it as a spiritual retreat and he never lost his attachment to the place.  Branagh did not look especially like FDR, but did a credible job, as did Cynthia Nixon and Paymer.  I also loved the look of the film.  I never had a moment when I could not accept it for the early 1920s and I truly loved seeing the scenes at both Warm Springs and Hyde Park.  It is definitely a film I recommend to others.I enjoyed seeing a couple of people in supporting roles.  I had trouble for a while identifying who the actor playing FDR's black valet Roy Collier was, but then it hit me that it was Nelsan Ellis, a couple of years before getting the role of Lafayette on TRUE BLOOD.  He doesn't get a lot of lines in this film, but he gets a great deal of screen time.  I liked that he was shown as a presence in FDR's life.  He stayed with FDR for years, and literally put him to bed each night during his White House years and each morning helped get him up.  Someone even closer to my heart is Felicia Day, who plays Heloise, one of the polio patients at the inn (she plays the red-headed former dancer who had obviously attempted suicide.  She is probably best known as the creator, writer, producer, and star of the online series THE GUILD (its Season Three has just been released on DVD as an Amazon Only special).  She is also known as the female lead of DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG and as a guest on BUFFY Season 7 as one of the Potential Slayers and on DOLLHOUSE as guest star on perhaps the two most celebrated episodes of the series, ""Epitaph One"" and ""Epitaph Two: The Return.""  She even gets to sing a song in this one, though one of her talents, that of playing the violin, has never to my knowledge been put on display in any form.  By the way, if you are a fan of THE GUILD, if you pay very close attention you will see Teal Sherer, a very beautiful handicapped actress who always appears in a wheelchair in her roles.  On THE GUILD Season 3 she played the very funny Venom, the member of a rival and somewhat evil gaming guild.  She had a host of very, very funny moments where she threatens others by detailing all the terrible things that she will do to herself.

913331,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B0009UVBI6,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[7, 9]","Because I am experiencing disability and politics in a much different era than FDR himself, I appreciated seeing Joseph Sargent's well-crafted release. This is a movie which people are going to be disappointed when it ends simply because it is over.I saw this movie after my term as College Democrats of America ""Democrats with Disabilities"" base vote caucus chair ended. While the individual caucus was not founded until the 21st Century, I thought of the significance that the College Democrats of America organization had been founded through FDR's desire for collegiate outreach throughout the Democratic Party.I've seen other presidential movies (both documentary and docudrama), but I've never seen one so strongly promoting disability issues as being so personally interwoven to a politician's mission. FDR essentially became the great politician beloved by generations of Americans because he had to confront and challenge his own obstacles.Immediately following a scout visit, Roosevelt (Kenneth Brannagh) contracts polio. In 1921, most of the American public is afraid of people with disabilities, and Roosevelt himself is initially no exception. Initially believing that his public days are gone, he subsequently comes around with the support of his wife Eleanor (Cynthia Nixon) and political associates. Refusing to let him wallow in self-pity or become a shut-in as preferred by his mother Sara (Jane Alexander) their encouragement gives him the emotional and mental strength ultimately necessary to lead America.Contracting polio in a society that would hate him for who he became made Roosevelt precisely the man America needed.The film ends as he is giving Al Smith's nomination speech at the 1928 Democratic Convention.  Because most of the Americans who were not at the convention were listening over radio, they did not know that their eloquent speaker was in fact a person who used a wheelchair. This `camouflage' directly challenged one of that era's stereotypes about disability and intelligence.Realizing that it was done for budget and time constraints, I would have loved to see how Roosevelt continued on the campaign trail. However, this movie touched on many of the issues I and other people with disabilities have experienced today. I appreciated that the screenplay openly shows FDR frustrated with other people's diminished expectations of him only because of disability.Rather than embrace a 'poster child' approach, this film explicitly presented FDR and the other people with polio at Warm Springs as a ""community"" of people who made a difference for themselves, each other---and a nation!.",5,FDR...FDR...FDR!!!,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,2624,"['am', 'experiencing', 'disability', 'politics', 'much', 'different', 'era', 'FDR', 'appreciated', 'seeing', 'Joseph', 'Sargent', 'well-crafted', 'release', 'movie', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'when', 'simply', 'over.I', 'saw', 'movie', 'term', 'College', 'Democrats', 'America', 'Democrats', 'Disabilities', 'base', 'vote', 'caucus', 'chair', 'ended', 'individual', 'caucus', 'was', 'not', 'founded', '21st', 'Century', 'thought', 'significance', 'College', 'Democrats', 'America', 'organization', 'had', 'been', 'founded', 'FDR', 'desire', 'collegiate', 'outreach', 'Democratic', 'Party.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'presidential', 'movies', 'documentary', 'docudrama', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'one', 'so', 'strongly', 'promoting', 'disability', 'issues', 'being', 'so', 'personally', 'interwoven', 'politician', 'mission', 'FDR', 'essentially', 'became', 'great', 'politician', 'beloved', 'generations', 'Americans', 'had', 'confront', 'challenge', 'own', 'obstacles.Immediately', 'following', 'scout', 'visit', 'Roosevelt', 'Kenneth', 'Brannagh', 'contracts', 'polio', '1921', 'most', 'American', 'public', 'afraid', 'people', 'disabilities', 'Roosevelt', 'initially', 'exception', 'Initially', 'believing', 'public', 'days', 'are', 'gone', 'subsequently', 'support', 'wife', 'Eleanor', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'political', 'associates', 'Refusing', 'let', 'wallow', 'self-pity', 'become', 'shut-in', 'preferred', 'mother', 'Sara', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'encouragement', 'emotional', 'mental', 'strength', 'ultimately', 'necessary', 'lead', 'America.Contracting', 'polio', 'society', 'would', 'hate', 'who', 'became', 'made', 'Roosevelt', 'precisely', 'man', 'America', 'film', 'ends', 'giving', 'Al', 'Smith', 'nomination', 'speech', '1928', 'Democratic', 'Convention', 'most', 'Americans', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'convention', 'were', 'listening', 'radio', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'eloquent', 'speaker', 'was', 'fact', 'person', 'who', 'used', 'wheelchair', 'camouflage', 'directly', 'challenged', 'one', 'era', 'stereotypes', 'disability', 'intelligence.Realizing', 'was', 'done', 'budget', 'time', 'constraints', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'how', 'Roosevelt', 'continued', 'campaign', 'trail', 'However', 'movie', 'touched', 'many', 'issues', 'other', 'people', 'disabilities', 'have', 'experienced', 'today', 'appreciated', 'screenplay', 'openly', 'FDR', 'frustrated', 'other', 'people', 'diminished', 'expectations', 'only', 'disability.Rather', 'embrace', ""'poster"", 'child', 'approach', 'film', 'explicitly', 'presented', 'FDR', 'other', 'people', 'polio', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'community', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'difference', 'other', '-and', 'nation']",N/A

913334,A1C80B497LCYKA,B0009UVBI6,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[10, 11]","I've been a Kenneth Branagh fan for years. (I always struggle with the spelling.) I watched him make his feature directorial debut in Henry V and thought, ""This man is destined for greatness."" He was young, talented and had great vision and drive. He had been solid in Fortunes of War before that and interesting in Dead Again after. I loved his labor of joy in Much Ado About Nothing; but, unfortunately, I hated his interest in the macabre in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. I have watched him go from project to project through the years, evidently trying to find his creative self or the right part. Some of them were worthless roles - like Dr. Loveless in Wild, Wild, West; some were thankless - like Professor Lockhart in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Even his role as Shackleton in the A&E; miniseries by that name somehow didn't quite ring true. Then Warm Springs came along about a forty-something Franklin Delano Roosevelt: a part that seemed to be made for him - and he filled it perfectly.If his portrayal of FDR isn't his best performance to date, it has to be one of his top two or three. He's magnificent. I felt I was watching Roosevelt himself. The role is full of the ups and downs of a good dramatic piece, with his character going from youthful joy, to tragic despair, to newfound optimism, to blind determination, back to joyful victory. He shows a broad range of life experiences in that one role, and pulls it off beautifully.Franklin starts off as a wealthy politician with the world at his feet, totally oblivious to the feelings or circumstances of others, including his wife. He then discovers he has polio - infantile paralysis - and his life is thrown into a tailspin. After a bout with self-pity, he agrees to check himself into an obscure and run-down health spa in Warm Springs, Georgia - the other side of nowhere for a man of his background. It takes a lot to humble him, to get him to care for others and to start believing in his own recovery - but he finally makes the transition, with the help of the goodhearted proprietor of Warm Springs, Tom Loyless, played touchingly by Tim Blake Nelson (O Brother, Where Art Thou). He's also bolstered in his quest by the handicapped residents of the spa, many of whom came there because they knew he was there. Before long, they've become one big happy family, with most of the residents on the road to recovery, and Roosevelt turning the failing spa into a successful enterprise. Unfortunately, his own recovery is not so successful, and he must face a future confined to a wheelchair.The film does not show FDR's presidency; but we are given to understand that what he accomplished at Warm Springs - his attempts at recovery, which helped build his character; his desire to connect with people, which he learned from the other handicapped residents; and his success at turning the Warm Springs spa around - all helped prepare him for his life's greatest challenge: the office of president of the United States. Even though he tried to keep his handicap a secret from the American people through four terms of office, he never lost his heart for the less fortunate, and fought for them throughout the Great Depression and World War II.I actually got to be in this film and talk with Kenneth Branagh briefly. He seemed very much a man of the people, humble in spirit, in spite of his background - just as Roosevelt became through his tortured journey. I'm not saying Branagh has necessarily suffered as Roosevelt did; but his performance seems to testify to an empathy that could only have come from going through a place similar to Roosevelt's. I think Kenneth Branagh, director Joseph Sargent and writer Margaret Nagle have given us a very special gift in this film, and I don't think you'll ever think of FDR or Branagh in the same way again.There are other remarkable performances as well, most notably Cynthia Nixon (Sex and the City) as Eleanor, and Kathy Bates (About Schmidt) as Helena Mahoney, an innovative physical therapist and friend. Director Sargent has done a superb job utilizing the actual locations of FDR's experiences in Warm Springs, Atlanta and surrounding environs. The entire production is a masterpiece, and very worthy of the sixteen Emmy's it's been nominated for.Waitsel Smith",5,KENNETH BRANAGH'S BEST PERFORMANCE,1126569600,"09 13, 2005",2005,4291,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'fan', 'years', 'always', 'struggle', 'spelling', 'watched', 'make', 'feature', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Henry', 'V', 'thought', 'man', 'destined', 'greatness', 'was', 'young', 'talented', 'had', 'great', 'vision', 'drive', 'had', 'been', 'solid', 'Fortunes', 'War', 'interesting', 'Dead', 'Again', 'loved', 'labor', 'joy', 'Much', 'Ado', 'Nothing', 'unfortunately', 'hated', 'interest', 'macabre', 'Mary', 'Shelley', 'Frankenstein', 'have', 'watched', 'go', 'project', 'project', 'years', 'evidently', 'trying', 'find', 'creative', 'self', 'right', 'part', 'were', 'worthless', 'roles', 'Dr.', 'Loveless', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'were', 'thankless', 'Professor', 'Lockhart', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Chamber', 'Secrets', 'Even', 'role', 'Shackleton', 'A', 'E', 'miniseries', 'name', 'somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'ring', 'true', 'Then', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'came', 'along', 'forty-something', 'Franklin', 'Delano', 'Roosevelt', 'part', 'seemed', 'be', 'made', 'filled', 'perfectly.If', 'portrayal', 'FDR', ""n't"", 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'be', 'one', 'top', 'two', 'three', 'magnificent', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'Roosevelt', 'role', 'full', 'ups', 'downs', 'good', 'dramatic', 'piece', 'character', 'going', 'youthful', 'joy', 'tragic', 'despair', 'newfound', 'optimism', 'blind', 'determination', 'back', 'joyful', 'victory', 'broad', 'range', 'life', 'experiences', 'one', 'role', 'off', 'beautifully.Franklin', 'off', 'wealthy', 'politician', 'world', 'feet', 'totally', 'oblivious', 'feelings', 'circumstances', 'others', 'including', 'wife', 'then', 'polio', 'infantile', 'paralysis', 'life', 'thrown', 'tailspin', 'bout', 'self-pity', 'check', 'obscure', 'run-down', 'health', 'spa', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'Georgia', 'other', 'side', 'nowhere', 'man', 'background', 'lot', 'humble', 'get', 'care', 'others', 'start', 'believing', 'own', 'recovery', 'finally', 'transition', 'help', 'goodhearted', 'proprietor', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'Tom', 'Loyless', 'played', 'touchingly', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'also', 'bolstered', 'quest', 'handicapped', 'residents', 'spa', 'many', 'whom', 'came', 'there', 'knew', 'was', 'there', 'long', ""'ve"", 'become', 'one', 'big', 'happy', 'family', 'most', 'residents', 'road', 'recovery', 'Roosevelt', 'turning', 'failing', 'spa', 'successful', 'enterprise', 'Unfortunately', 'own', 'recovery', 'not', 'so', 'successful', 'must', 'face', 'future', 'confined', 'wheelchair.The', 'film', 'not', 'show', 'FDR', 'presidency', 'are', 'given', 'understand', 'what', 'accomplished', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'attempts', 'recovery', 'helped', 'build', 'character', 'desire', 'connect', 'people', 'learned', 'other', 'handicapped', 'residents', 'success', 'turning', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'spa', 'helped', 'prepare', 'life', 'greatest', 'challenge', 'office', 'president', 'United', 'States', 'Even', 'tried', 'keep', 'handicap', 'secret', 'American', 'people', 'four', 'terms', 'office', 'never', 'lost', 'heart', 'less', 'fortunate', 'fought', 'Great', 'Depression', 'World', 'War', 'II.I', 'actually', 'got', 'be', 'film', 'talk', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'briefly', 'seemed', 'very', 'much', 'man', 'people', 'humble', 'spirit', 'spite', 'background', 'just', 'Roosevelt', 'became', 'tortured', 'journey', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Branagh', 'necessarily', 'suffered', 'Roosevelt', 'did', 'performance', 'testify', 'empathy', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'come', 'going', 'place', 'similar', 'Roosevelt', 'think', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'director', 'Joseph', 'Sargent', 'writer', 'Margaret', 'Nagle', 'have', 'given', 'very', 'special', 'gift', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'think', 'FDR', 'Branagh', 'same', 'way', 'are', 'other', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'notably', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'Sex', 'City', 'Eleanor', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Schmidt', 'Helena', 'Mahoney', 'innovative', 'physical', 'therapist', 'friend', 'Director', 'Sargent', 'done', 'superb', 'job', 'utilizing', 'actual', 'locations', 'FDR', 'experiences', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'Atlanta', 'surrounding', 'environs', 'entire', 'production', 'masterpiece', 'very', 'worthy', 'sixteen', 'Emmy', 'been', 'nominated', 'for.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A
