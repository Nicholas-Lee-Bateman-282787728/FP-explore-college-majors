823751,AUW1K6KBIG17A,B000243DQM,Hawkeye,"[9, 9]","Release of this mini-series Film on DVD in the US is LONG OVERDUE!As a fan of bio-pics, and historical accounts of recent history, especially WWII, I have to say that this is one of the best ever produced.  It is a unique view of the events surrounding one of America's most famous and popular (although, in my opinion, also one of the most over-rated) generals, Dwight D. Eisenhower.This unique view is from the perspective of IKE's English female driver, personal secretary, confidant and love-interest, Kay Summersby.  Much is taken from the book that she wrote.  I read her book shortly after seeing this mini-series when it originally aired.  And the account given here is consistent with her account.  Some historians have since argued that Kay overstated her role.  However, I found her story, as I read it those years ago, to be believable, and not out-of-step with biographies of IKE I have read since then.  Furthermore, Kay did not state that they had this passionate love affair, but rather emphasized the intimate feelings that she and IKE had developed for each other, not unusual for two people caught in such events and working so closely together.  I recall that Kay also emphasized that, although she was ""in love"" with IKE, and she believed that he had strong feelings for her, he had never voiced those feelings even when they were alone together.I find this Film very compelling.  I have seen it several times (from my laserdisc copy) since the original airing.  I must say each repeat viewing is as good as or even better than the one before.  It is one of the best non-fictional accounts of that era - along with Eleanor & Franklin (recently released on DVD), Tora Tora Tora,  and Midway (if you fast forward through the fictional story-halting father/son relationship scenes).Robert Duvall's performance is outstanding.  There are moments - particularly the scene of him with the airborne troops as they prepared for their pre-D-Day launch - when it is as if the pictures I have seen taken from the actual event have come to life.  Lee Remick gives a touching, heart-felt and convincing portrayal of Kay Summersby.  I have never seen any interviews of Kay (if they even exist), but Remick seems to fit the physical type, based on the photos I have seen.  And her portrayal seems to be consistent with what I read in her book.  The supporting cast is excellent.(A bit off topic, but I had mentioned above that I believe IKE to be over-rated as a general.  If you are interested in the strategic and tactical facts surrounding D-Day, read the account written by Stephen E. Ambrose, ""D Day: June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II.""  It is excellent.  I liked it because it allowed me to sift through some of the scenes in one of my all-time-favorite WWII movies, ""The Longest Day"", to determine how much was fiction and how much was factual or at least fact-based.  I found the film (""The Longest Day) to be surprisingly consistent with fact.  And although Ambrose's book does not necessarily draw this direct conclusion, I can't help but find ultimate responsibility for much that went wrong with D-Day - the preventable casualties and ineffective use of tanks and off-shore bombardment during the actual landing, etc. - with IKE, and in particular his decision to place the American invasion under the command of Bradley (another extremely over-rated general, IMO),  rather than the far more experienced and capable Patton.)Also, a quick note that this film does not detail ""the life of Dwight D. Eisenhower"" as the summary states.  Rather it begins with the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and ends with the end of hostilities in Europe.  If you are looking for a bio-pic of the ""life of Dwight D. Eisenhower"", including events leading up to WWII (including his role in WWI serving with General MacArthur) and events subsequent to WWII (including his role in Europe during the Truman Administration and his role as President of the United States), this is not it.  It simply does not cover those events at all.  I am not aware of any bio-pic that does.  The best I am aware of is the American Experience biography of Eisenhower, which I strongly recommend.EPILOG:  Something very telling of the character and personality of Dwight D. Eisenhower that still stands out for me to this day from Kay Summersby's book, (which would have been a nice touch to somehow have put in the film), was something she wrote about the dog she had given to IKE as a birthday present.  As revealed in the film, IKE had named the dog Telek; after his England HQ (Telegraph Cottage) and Kay (Tele-K).  When he left, he left the dog with Kay - presumably he did not want, or could not deal with, such a reminder of her when he went back to his life with Mamie.  Years after he had left, and I believe was already President, Telek died.  Kay wrote to IKE to let him know.  I don't know if the letter ever survived - or if it was destroyed by IKE or possibly intercepted by one of this staff.  Either way, Kay wrote in her book that IKE never replied.",5,First Review of this Film,1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,5055,"['Release', 'mini-series', 'Film', 'DVD', 'US', 'LONG', 'OVERDUE', 'fan',
