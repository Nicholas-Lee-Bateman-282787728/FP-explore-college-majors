But the main reason I wrote this review was to respond to some ignorant posts I had read.  Particulary to the one about how Walmart ""edits"" their DVD's.  Are you crazy?  Are you even thinking?  Why would a low cost store take the ""time"" (pronounced ""money"") to produce their own versions of DVD's?  For one thing, they sell ""The Soprano's.""  And do you think they edit all their DVD's of the Sopranos?  I don't think so.They also sell Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.  Do they edit out the swear words from the main characters of that videogame?  Do they even have the means to do such a thing?  I don't even think most of their employees (including their Corporate office) has much more than a High School degree!I bought the Beastie Boy's CD ""No Sleep 'til Brookly"" and no lyrics were edited.  In fact, when I asked, the clerk told me they would only sell the edited version, so as you can see, even their store employees don't know what the hell they're talking about!I really can't believe how ignorant you sound claiming that some store, on their own accord, edits and sells a DVD set?  You are very ignorant, and quite inept at understanding production and marketing costs!Walmart ""editing"" their products is a dumb ""Suburban legend"" that only very ignorant country folk believe.  Stop spreading rumors, and use your brain before posting such tripe!  The world will be better off.  Thank you.Stick with Amazon and other fine retailers!  And if you feel like buying from Walmart, do so, but stop making incorrect assumptions about their products.",4,Different Stores don't sell edited versions.,1140220800,"02 18, 2006",2006,1629,"['Okay', 'bought', 'Best', 'Buy', 'about', '16.99', 'tax', 'Heck', 'bargain', 'main', 'reason', 'wrote', 'review', 'was', 'respond', 'ignorant', 'posts', 'had', 'read', 'Particulary', 'one', 'how', 'Walmart', 'edits', 'DVD', 'Are', 'crazy', 'Are', 'even', 'thinking', 'Why', 'would', 'low', 'cost', 'store', 'take', 'time', 'pronounced', 'money', 'produce', 'own', 'versions', 'DVD', 'one', 'thing', 'sell', 'Soprano', 'do', 'think', 'edit', 'DVD', 'Sopranos', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.They', 'also', 'sell', 'Grand', 'Theft', 'Auto', 'San', 'Andreas', 'Do', 'edit', 'out', 'swear', 'words', 'main', 'characters', 'videogame', 'Do', 'even', 'have', 'means', 'do', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'most', 'employees', 'including', 'Corporate', 'office', 'much', 'more', 'High', 'School', 'degree', 'bought', 'Beastie', 'Boy', 'CD', 'Sleep', ""'til"", 'Brookly', 'lyrics', 'were', 'edited', 'fact', 'when', 'asked', 'clerk', 'told', 'would', 'only', 'sell', 'edited', 'version', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'even', 'store', 'employees', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'hell', ""'re"", 'talking', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'ignorant', 'sound', 'claiming', 'store', 'own', 'accord', 'edits', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'very', 'ignorant', 'quite', 'inept', 'understanding', 'production', 'marketing', 'costs', 'Walmart', 'editing', 'products', 'dumb', 'Suburban', 'legend', 'only', 'very', 'ignorant', 'country', 'folk', 'believe', 'Stop', 'spreading', 'rumors', 'use', 'brain', 'posting', 'such', 'tripe', 'world', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'Thank', 'you.Stick', 'Amazon', 'other', 'fine', 'retailers', 'feel', 'buying', 'Walmart', 'do', 'so', 'stop', 'making', 'incorrect', 'assumptions', 'products']",1st and Ten - Complete Collection

941664,A31I44ESG7UPR,B000BFJM5S,G. Ratcheson,"[1, 1]","I purchased the set today at Best Buy. With the confusion I have seen online here are some facts:1. My set is on 6 Dual Sided Single Layered dvd's.2. Most episodes run 22:24. I don't know how long the original HBO episodes ran.3. There is definitely some compression as most of the discs run over 2 hours (up to 3 hours) per side & the discs aren't even full. The 3 discs I checked run from 3.8-4.0 gb per side.This edition has a UPC of 844628050111 & an ISBN of 1-579837-149-5I would be very curious to know how long the original HBO episodes ran, so we could know for certain if this edition is edited or not.Great value for the money (I paid $16.99), but would have preferred standard 2 hour mode quality.1/18/06:After having written the above, I watched several episodes & completely agree with the 2 reviewers who wrote after me. Most episodes are the edited syndicated version. The gentleman from Tango who was quoted below is either misquoted, misinformed or lying. It is really obvious which episodes are edited.

In fact I have watched the whole entire series 3 times over from beginning to end in the past 3-4 years so it has replay value. It's a pretty darn funny series but the humor may be a little bit outdated but you can't pass this up for the price they are asking. When I paid for this it was 10.00 now it's less than that.

I love comedies and this one is mediocre and entertaining.First, this series was on HBO in the 1980s. There is some female frontal nudity shown occasionally. The California Bulls is a fictional team whose owner was caught in a messy divorce. Delta Burke played Diane Barrow, the scorned divorced wife, who gets the team.I have to say Delta Burke was perfect for the first three seasons. The first two seasons are about Diane and the team. She left for bigger and better things. The remaining seasons turned to the players and got off track. Still they brought female presidents played by Shanna Reed and Shannon Tweed.It's weird to see OJ Simpson playing general manager TD Parker. The role wasn't a stretch for him and he was fine.Still this six double side discs is condensed for the viewers.  Except for one disc, the quality was fine overall. It would have been beneficial to know more about the series. I enjoyed the series despite my own lack of interest for football.

The first season was definitly a beginning. But, it did address issues in pro football at the time, and reflect currently what baseball is going through.
