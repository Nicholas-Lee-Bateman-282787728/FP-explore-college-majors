Tammilee's style is great.  She's wonderfully friendly and has great cueing.  How can you resist an instructor that says ""please"" when you're gutting out those last reps?

567891,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000055ZGQ,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[8, 10]","Tamilee Webb, a well-known veteran instructor, has put together a new series of ""I want those..."" tapes. Each tape contains two 15-minute workouts focused on a particular part of the body. At the start of the video, Tamilee explains that she did exhaustive research to determine which exercises were the most effective and then included the exercises that rated highest in her workouts. For each workout, Tamilee is exercising solo in the same studio from her ""Quick Toning"" series (minus the two televisions showing her from different angles). In fact, the entire feel of this video is similar to the QT workouts, but it moves much more quickly, including shorter workout and cool-down times.  Tamilee is an excellent instructor and good at cueing, but in this video, she moves so fast between the exercises that it is sometimes difficult to keep up.The first workout consisted of fairly traditional abs moves, mostly different variations on crunches.  The one move that was more unique I found rather difficult to do--it felt awkward and was uncomfortable for my back.  Overall, this was a very average workout for the abs area.  Tamilee does all the moves for 12 repetitions and then moves through a second round of 8 reps per exercise.  The second workout begins with a standing side bend using hand weights.  Tamilee uses this exercise in her ""I Want That Body!"" video as well, and I just didn't feel I got much from it either time.  She then moves to the floor for and begins some non-traditional moves that not only didn't I enjoy, but also I felt the exercises strained my back.  When she continued with more moves that hurt my back, I finally gave up and did not complete the second workout.  After doing the tape yesterday, my abs do feel sore today, but unfortunately, so does my back.Like the other reviewer who gave up on this tape, I'm in pretty good shape--I exercise regularly and am able to do intermediate Pilates and other abs work with no problem.  I probabaly could have gotten through this workout too, but it just wasn't worth it to me.  I know that you have to work hard in order to see results, and while I do like my workouts to be challenging, I also like them to be doable.  I much prefer the Quick Fix Abs workout to this tape and would recommend it to others.",2,Not Tamilee's best,1029283200,"08 14, 2002",2002,2289,"['Tamilee', 'Webb', 'well-known', 'veteran', 'instructor', 'put', 'together', 'new', 'series', 'want', 'tapes', 'tape', 'two', '15-minute', 'workouts', 'focused', 'particular', 'part', 'body', 'start', 'video', 'Tamilee', 'did', 'exhaustive', 'research', 'determine', 'exercises', 'were', 'most', 'effective', 'then', 'included', 'exercises', 'rated', 'highest', 'workouts', 'workout', 'Tamilee', 'exercising', 'solo', 'same', 'studio', 'Quick', 'Toning', 'series', 'two', 'televisions', 'showing', 'different', 'angles', 'fact', 'entire', 'feel', 'video', 'similar', 'QT', 'workouts', 'much', 'more', 'quickly', 'including', 'shorter', 'workout', 'cool-down', 'times', 'Tamilee', 'excellent', 'instructor', 'good', 'cueing', 'video', 'so', 'fast', 'exercises', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'keep', 'up.The', 'first', 'workout', 'consisted', 'fairly', 'traditional', 'abs', 'moves', 'mostly', 'different', 'variations', 'crunches', 'one', 'move', 'was', 'more', 'unique', 'found', 'rather', 'difficult', 'do', 'felt', 'awkward', 'was', 'uncomfortable', 'back', 'Overall', 'was', 'very', 'average', 'workout', 'abs', 'area', 'Tamilee', 'moves', '12', 'repetitions', 'then', 'moves', 'second', 'round', '8', 'reps', 'exercise', 'second', 'workout', 'standing', 'side', 'bend', 'using', 'hand', 'weights', 'Tamilee', 'exercise', 'Want', 'Body', 'video', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'got', 'much', 'time', 'then', 'floor', 'non-traditional', 'moves', 'not', 'only', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'also', 'felt', 'exercises', 'strained', 'back', 'When', 'continued', 'more', 'moves', 'hurt', 'back', 'finally', 'gave', 'up', 'did', 'not', 'complete', 'second', 'workout', 'doing', 'tape', 'yesterday', 'abs', 'do', 'feel', 'sore', 'today', 'unfortunately', 'so', 'other', 'reviewer', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'tape', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'good', 'shape', 'exercise', 'regularly', 'am', 'able', 'do', 'intermediate', 'Pilates', 'other', 'abs', 'work', 'problem', 'probabaly', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'workout', 'too', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'know', 'have', 'work', 'hard', 'order', 'see', 'results', 'do', 'workouts', 'be', 'challenging', 'also', 'like', 'be', 'doable', 'much', 'prefer', 'Quick', 'Fix', 'Abs', 'workout', 'tape', 'would', 'recommend', 'others']",N/A

I actually didn't have high hopes for it because I thought, what ELSE could she use in her videos? She sticks to the basics because they work, which is a very effective approach, but sometimes boring. However, I was VERY pleased with this tape!! She does have some of the basics but she also adds some great new moves that KILL! I am always so happy with Tamilee and this is no different. I would definately recommend this tape! You will be pleased! :) I should mention also that I exercise regulary however am NOT advanced when it comes to abs.

But I really wanted to sculpt my abs, and with this video (used 3 times a week), I've been able to do just that.I found Program 1 (the 1st 15-minute workout of the video) to be rather easy, so I tried Program 2, which is a 15-minute workout featuring some rather unique moves. Tamilee takes you through the moves quickly, which I like because before you know it, you're done.  The time really flies. I find the workout challenging, but not impossible, and it doesn't cause neck or back pain (which is often a problem with other ab workouts I've tried).Tamilee's cuing and personality are excellent.  She's not &quot;phoney&quot; and she doesn't grate on your nerves, which is important because when your crunching your abs and feeling the burn, the last thing you want is an aggravating instructor barking out commands and shallow words of encouragement.",5,A great addition to my fitness video library,1055376000,"06 12, 2003",2003,975,"['morning', 'do', 'series', 'crunches', 'leg', 'lifts', 'target', 'lower', 'abs', 'cross-over', 'crunches', 'target', 'obliques', 'really', 'wanted', 'sculpt', 'abs', 'video', 'used', '3', 'times', 'week', ""'ve"", 'been', 'able', 'do', 'just', 'that.I', 'found', 'Program', '1', '1st', '15-minute', 'workout', 'video', 'be', 'rather', 'easy', 'so', 'tried', 'Program', '2', '15-minute', 'workout', 'featuring', 'rather', 'unique', 'moves', 'Tamilee', 'moves', 'quickly', 'like', 'know', ""'re"", 'done', 'time', 'really', 'flies', 'find', 'workout', 'challenging', 'not', 'impossible', ""n't"", 'cause', 'neck', 'back', 'pain', 'often', 'problem', 'other', 'ab', 'workouts', ""'ve"", 'tried', '.Tamilee', 'cuing', 'personality', 'are', 'excellent', 'not', 'quot', 'phoney', 'quot', ""n't"", 'grate', 'nerves', 'important', 'when', 'crunching', 'abs', 'feeling', 'burn', 'last', 'thing', 'want', 'aggravating', 'instructor', 'barking', 'out', 'commands', 'shallow', 'words', 'encouragement']",N/A
