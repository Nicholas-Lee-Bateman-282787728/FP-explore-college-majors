I had intended to hold off for a Blu-Ray release but that doesn't appear to on the horizon. Both of these are inexplicable. I wound up buying mine for about $20 on Amazon UK.All that aside, the film is a remarkable document of the trials and tribulations of an actor, hamstrung by tough man roles and illness, and a first-time producer who was obliged to fly by wire and sort things as they happened, and the glory they both found together.Attention to detail is key when you make a period piece so I can't see how William Hartnell can sit home grumbling about being a legitimate character actor, watching an old Army Game, with a D reg car in the driveway. In 1963, it was an A reg.Minor quibble because the rest, it soon becomes very apparent, is a labour of love. Mark Gatiss' script neatly compresses three years into 90 minutes of very intelligent film. Everyone involved works hard at this and it shows and kudos to the Beeb for pulling it off. It is an affectionate recounting of a well-known story and it seems to have the feel of a reminiscence. It has a sort of soft glow about it, as though you are lifting up the veil of years and simply remembering...David Bradley's performance is exceptional and captures not just the cantankerous, crotchety old buffer but the softer, gentler side of Bill Hartnell. It is quite apparent how much love he had for the show and it could not have been a decision lightly made to let him go.I now look at his performances in early Doctor Who in a completely new light. His was the first Doctor I remember and his will always be the best.Buy this from Amazon UK.

1678622,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00GJOXW1A,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","In 2013, two side projects enhanced the celebration of Doctor Who's 50th anniversary. One is the 7-minute webisode, ""Night of the Doctor,"" that re-introduced Paul McGann to the mythos. The other is this remarkable biodrama, Doctor Who - An Adventure in Space & Time. While social media blew up over ""Night of the Doctor,"" I don't think An Adventure in Space Time received its just propers. This is a must-see picture for Doctor Who fans. And for those others who are too cool for school, the absorbing narrative may beckon to them as well.It's a narrative presumed to be heavy on facts and figures, and it's so. What's unexpected is how it compels on an emotional level. The plot focuses sharply on a trio of misfits that banded together to launch Doctor Who. ""C.S. Lewis meets H.G. Wells meets Father Christmas - that's the Doctor,"" is how one character breaks down the show's peculiar protagonist. And also ""stern and scary but with a twinkle.""Matt Gatiss wrote the thing, and he should be tremendously proud. The performances are spot-on. It's bananas how uncannily David Bradley channels William Hartnell, how closely Jessica Raine resembles Verity Lambert. Verity Lambert happens to be a trailblazer in British television. In 1963, when everyone smoked like chimney stacks, Verity Lambert was only 28 years old when she was tapped by the BBC's Head of Drama, Sydney Newman (Brian Cox), as the Beeb's first ever female producer and tasked with riding herd on this upcoming longshot of a sci-fi series. For Verity, it must've been harrowing being promptly thrown to the wolves, in dubious company with an insecure, aging actor for the series star and a young, untested Indian director. The movie doesn't shy away from documenting the obstacles these three faced. This was an era in which sexism and racial prejudice essayed no apologies, in which opinionated persons didn't scurry behind politically correct conduct. We see the contempt and dismissiveness with which Verity - that ""pushy Jewish bird"" - is treated. We see the Indian director, Waris Hussein (Sacha Dhawan), repeatedly fail to get the bartender's attention.If I had my druthers, the film would've tracked more of Verity's and Waris's respective personal lives. Instead it fixates only on William Hartnell's. Maybe it's appropriate. Out of the three, Hartnell is the one who most requires the humanizing touch. The teleplay probes beneath the man's cantakerous surface to reveal his frailties and insecurities. David Bradley, whose part is so contemptible in Game of Thrones, shows us a warmer, more vulnerable side to William Hartnell. In the end, it's Hartnell's arc that gives the narrative its beating heart.I'll take the word of those I know who were around in the '60s and who professed themselves impressed with the execution of the film, with how it captures the zeitgeist of that period, with how the sets and props and costumes all came together. Those steeped in Doctor Who lore can pick out this and that Easter egg (there is a bunch). One historical event locks down the time frame. Doctor Who was already an underdog series when the JFK assassination snatched away the headlines, commandeered Doctor Who's air time during its debut broadcast. We note Ms. Lambert's fight to keep the creepy Daleks in the show (despite complaints from the suits that they were ""cheapjack science-fiction drek""). Bradley provides the poignancy, but Jessica Raine as Verity Lambert is as equally accomplished, just as pivotal. More than anyone else, Lambert put herself on the line, fought for the show, tooth and nail, and she did this time and again. Thanks to her and to Hartnell and Hussein and, okay, to the Beeb's Head of Drama, Sydney Newman, there may be a future after all for a show about an alien gent what explores time and space in a blue police box. This movie is so good that, in a way, that it's about the genesis of Doctor Who becomes almost incidental to me. I was caught up in the struggles of the people behind the scene, with how hard they fought against the old guard and how they upended pre-conceptions and how, ultimately, they walked away and left their show to carry on.

The film itself is wonderful and After seeing it twice on BBC America, I was eager to add it to my DVD collection.If you watch many of the extras which come with the published DVDs before seeing this film, you will be struck by just how well they were able to portray 1963 London in the modern era. Factually, this film may stumble here and there, but it was meant more as a drama to immortalize the birth of a television icon (Doctor Who) as well as to show that most of the rules and alien menaces (Daleks, Cybermen, the Doctor as a fugitive from Gallifrey and the regeneration process) were with the series from its very earliest incarnation. The fact that what saved the show was preemption of the story &#34;4,000,000 years BC&#34; for coverage of the JFK assassination followed by the story &#34;The Daleks&#34; the next week proves that both the series and the Daleks, young and low budget as they were, have had a lasting effect.
