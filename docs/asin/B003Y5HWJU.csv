I had no clue what I was getting into, but this is a top-notch show in every respect. I truly believe it is Steve Buscemi's best. He plays a truly complex character, you end up loving the guy, and rooting for him, but there is a real controlling, greedy, self-serving dark under-belly to him that is so well done, it feels as though it is a natural part of him. He is naturally a really nice guy, and naturally a really greedy jerk at the same time. I have to add that I'm slightly shocked at the amount of almost in-your-face belligerent full-body nudity and soft-porn content, as it is pretty much unnecessary. The series stands completely on its own in terms of acting, plot, etc. You get the feeling that there is some kind of drive to try to be as nude and crude with the sex scenes as possible.

1375625,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B003Y5HWJU,C. Sawin,"[5, 8]","Hugo seemed like such a departure for director Martin Scorsese; a man who usually delivers very adult and captivating crime films that usually revolve around gangsters and are nothing less than extraordinary. A family film featuring none of a director's known genre trademarks and relies on nothing more than his visionary and artistic style just feels so rare these days. Not many directors are willing to take that sort of risk, especially at this point in their career. That's where ""Boardwalk Empire"" comes in. ""Boardwalk Empire"" feels exactly like what you'd expect and love from Scorsese and was more than likely the happy middle ground while he was working on Hugo. Even though Hugo didn't make its way into theaters until 2011 and ""Boardwalk Empire"" debuted on HBO in 2010, Scorsese probably had some overlapping duties on both projects somewhere in there. But enough about Hugo, ""Boardwalk Empire"" is very much its own beast and it wastes little time ripping into your core right from the start.""Boardwalk Empire"" uses every inch of its HBO television format; every curse word under the sun is used frequently with a very particular fondness for the F-word in general, women seem to be itching at the chance to take their clothes off (and more than likely are since a good portion of the first season takes place in a brothel in Chicago) as both full frontal nudity for both sexes is included along with fairly explicit sex scenes, and then there's the exceptional amount of violence in the show you've become familiar with when stories are told about gangsters. Guys getting whacked, headshots, beat downs, choke-outs, hangings, and robberies that go south only begin to skim the top of what to expect from the show. None of this should be considered a bad thing either as all of these ingredients along with the storyline, the cast, and the exceptional set pieces only help contribute to the powerhouse the show has become.Take Shelter was one of the films that made it on to many ""top 10 best films"" of last year and it's fascinating that two thirds of its main cast are supporting characters on this show. Shea Whigham plays Eli Thompson, the brother of Steve Buscemi's Nucky Thompson. Despite being brothers, the underlying tension between the two is what you'll take away most from their relationship as Eli seems to not only envy his brother's treasurer position but feels like he could do what his brother does even better. Michael Shannon is Agent Nelson Van Alden; a strict prohibition agent that puts his job before anything else. Van Alden is a very religious man, but the way he honors The Lord becomes very peculiar as his personal demons come to light as the season progresses. Steve Buscemi is excellent as Nucky Thompson, but Michael Pitt really comes into his own as Jimmy Darmody. The way Jimmy evolves, his past with the war, and the struggle to keep his family together causes Jimmy to be the most standout character of the entire cast. Stephen Graham, Michael Stuhlbarg, Kelly Macdonald, and Vincent Piazza aren't to be overlooked either. The ensemble cast is just really spectacular all around.What makes ""Boardwalk Empire"" work as well as it does is the way it seems to capture the atmosphere of 1920. The set pieces are extraordinary, especially on the boardwalk. The classic cars and the custom made suits for the men and the extravagant dresses for the women all seem to be pulled straight from that particular time period and placed on this boardwalk of a rebuilt Atlantic City from over ninety years ago. Then there's the way that nearly everyone smoked back then and that is more than relevant here. If somebody isn't drinking, then they're more than likely smoking and there's rarely a scene without one of the two occurring. The music may be the coup de grace though that really seals the essence of the early 20's. They really did an exceptional job making you feel like you've traveled back to this time period.""Boardwalk Empire"" seems to have all of the appropriate seeds planted to achieve greatness. You get a front row seat to see how gangsters and politicians do business, you have a fascinating storyline with a rogue's gallery full of interesting characters all featuring their own quirks and traits to allow you to fall in love with or come to hate each and every one of them, and the show really makes you feel like you're walking on the boardwalk of Atlantic City in 1920. It is on the cusp of really fantastic things. With that said, I don't think season one really gets to those things just yet. There are teases that feature some really incredible scenes (Jimmy's boardwalk beat down of the photographer is a favorite of mine), but the first season feels like just that; an introduction. Hopefully the seasons to come can capitalize on this and ""Boardwalk Empire"" can evolve into one of the greatest shows to ever be produced.The Blu-ray set is pretty loaded with special features. Each disc features an Enhanced Viewing Mode for all twelve episodes. This mode goes behind the scenes while discussing the production, history locations, the music, and cast interviews among many other things. The main issue I had was that every time I tried to watch the Enhanced Viewing Mode on any episode my Blu-ray player would reboot. I made sure it was up to date, but it still had this problem. I also had this problem whenever I went to ""Episodes"" on any of the main menu on the discs. I had to ""Play All"" and skip through the episodes I'd already seen if I only watched one episode at a time and returned to it later. So I'm not entirely sure if that's because there was a problem with the set or my player, but considering the player is only a few months old I'm thinking it's the former.Other special features include a Character Dossier which features profiles of every character and full length bios, six audio commentaries with Terence Winter, Steve Buscemi, Michael Kenneth Williams, Michael Shannon, and more, Speakeasy Tour which is a twenty four minute tour of some of the famed Prohibition speakeasies in Chicago and New York with cast from the show, Atlantic City: The Original Sin City is a nearly thirty minute documentary on the history of Atlantic City during the 1920s, a nineteen minute Making Boardwalk Empire featurette is mostly just an intro to the characters but also goes into detail about the show's conception and how Martin Scorsese became involved, and my personal favorite Creating the Boardwalk. It's only five minutes long, but it gives you a look at how the boardwalk was built on the show. A real set was built outside as CG was used to add extra stories and the ocean. It's just really incredible to see just how much of this show is computer generated.The Blu-ray set of The Complete First Season of Boardwalk Empire is unrated, presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio in DTS Surround Sound, features all twelve episodes, and is approximately 733 minutes long. It (along with the DVD version of the set) is now available in most retail outlets and online stores.",4,Just shy of being absolutely fantastic,1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,7039,"['Hugo', 'seemed',

1375629,A3C1Q9TRP83BYB,B003Y5HWJU,Daniel A. Brown,"[4, 5]","The 1920's come alive in this visually-rich drama where the set design alone is one of the stars. We are used to seeing that era as grainy black and white images that appear drab and stagnant. ""Boardwalk Empire"" recreates Atlantic City as an electrically lit fairy land, a sensual paradise where every pleasure is available - if you got the money. This HBO series follows the exploits of real life crime figure, Enoch ""Nucky"" Thompson, who manipulates a world of such mind-boggling graft, greed, corruption, casual cruelty and sex that Tony Soprano and his pals appear like lightweights by comparison.The series begins just as the Volstead Act (Prohibition) comes into being and Nucky, Atlantic City's Republican Party boss, is addressing the Women's Temperance League. After which, he arranges for a shipment of illegal hooch to be offloaded which will net him a bundle. It's a cliche to say that organized crime began with Prohibition but the amount of money changing hands as everyone wants a piece of the action is staggering. Everyone is on the take, even elected officials. It's difficult at times to tell the gangsters, including such criminal luminaries as Al Capone, ""Lucky"" Luciano, and Arnold Rothstein, from the senators, governors and town fathers who are equally venal. The only pious adversary is a Federal agent, Nelson Van Alden (played with square-jawed brutality by Michael Shannon) so odious (he flogs himself for sexual gratification) that you can't help rooting for the bad guys.Overall, the acting is excellent and Steve Buscemi, as Nucky, gets a chance to exploit that exaggerated wise-guy voice of his we've learned to love. He meets his match in Margaret Schroeder (an understated Kelly Macdonald) who under her waif-life fragility has a backbone of steel with a mind to match.

1375637,A1F2UP7X9KB2YF,B003Y5HWJU,Demosthenes,"[40, 84]","I look at the favourable reviews for this program and wonder how, or why, the reviewers have not noticed:(a) that the script-writing is awful.  Where to begin?  The ridiculous liberties taken with history would be a start.  The implausible dialogue would be a close second.  Did nobody read the script aloud before they started filming?  Did nobody do any study of how people spoke at the time?  The two dimensional character development would be third. Characters cut from cardboard, stuck together with wall-paper paste.(b) the acting is just bad.  It would be bad even for a soap opera.  ""Wooden"" is an appropriate adjective for much of it.  Then there are the ever-painful attempts by latter-day actors to mimick accents.  If you have no idea what an Irish accent sounds like, don't try to do an Irish accent.  If you don't have any idea what an Italian accent ought to sound like, don't do an Italian accent.  If you don't do Polish, or Yiddish, or German, then leave it alone.(c)  the camera-work is bad in a way that is difficult to explain.  It is the kind of camera work that might be ok in an airplane safety video explaining how to buckle your lap belt, how to find the life vest, and how to proceed to the emergency exit.  That anybody can find work in TV drama with this kind of camera-work is a very sad comment about TV.(d)  the ""no-name brand"" camera work may flow from the direction, which, not surprisingly, is awful.There is nothing clever in this production.  Nothing.  It includes the same gratuitous violence, unrealistic, over-the-top, ""violence-as-pornography"" you would expect.  The direction can never, ever, leave the viewer to figure out anything by himself or herself.  Heaven forbid that any scene should have any (intentional) irony, or anything but the most obvious, leaden double-entendre.That is why the camera is positioned and operated as if they are trying to make an instructional video, so that the viewer can't possibly misunderstand what the director is trying to get across.  It is why the dialogue is wrong: Always use contemporary 2011 dialogue, and, if in doubt, make it stilted, and throw in lots of 2011-style swearing, because there is a chance that if the script required dialogue from the 1920's, spoken as it might actually have been, the viewers wouldn't understand - they might need sub-titles, and the intended audience for this show isn't the kind that knows what to do with sub-titles.  Use every possible cliche or worn phrase, to make sure that every possible viewer, no matter how stupid, will understand them. The production seems to be driven by the principle: Why do anything subtle, when you can hit the viewer over the head with it ten times instead.It is why the violence can't be just ordinary violence, it has to be cartoon violence, pornographic violence, with large quantities of blood splattered on everything in the scene - otherwise the audience might not understand that they really, really, really killed the man. Both the violence and the ridiculous sex are over-acted in the manner of slapstick comedy, or vaudeville, or silent films before talkies.  It's a cartoon caricature.  It is clumsy, ham-fisted, bull-in-a-china-shop, second or third-grade work.  When the three stooges did this kind of stuff, it was intended to be funny.  This production wasn't intended to be funny. It isn't.  It is just bad.If there is one word that sums up the multitude of failings of this production it would be: ""Artless"".The only things about this series that are reasonably well done?

1375654,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B003Y5HWJU,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 7]","Atlantic City, 1920. The war has just ended, Prohibition has just started, and a new breed of criminal is on the rise.Based on the true-life story of Enoch ""Nucky"" Johnson, this brilliant HBO series brutally kicks aside any romantic notions we might have had about the flappers'n'bathtub-gin era of American history. It's bloody, sexual, and full of cruel ruthless men who are saved from being TOTALLY despicable by little acts of kindness.Enoch ""Nucky"" Thompson (Steve Buscemi) is the unofficial boss of Atlantic City. While officially only the state treasurer, he actually has his fingers in every business in the city -- and now that Prohibition has started, he's also the boss of the bootlegging biz in New Jersey. His creepy brother is the sheriff, so he basically controls the cops as well.However, his ""boardwalk empire"" is constantly under threat. His protoge Jimmy (Michael Pitt) is involved in a whiskey robbery that ends up becoming a huge bloody mess, and soon fanatical Prohibition agent Van Allen (Michael Shannon) arrives to uncover what REALLY happened. So now Nucky must fend off the Feds, as well as dealing with a lynched black gangster, boardwalk thefts, the ""Celtic Dinner,"" and weeks of pre-election politicking.And while all this is going on, Nucky is forced to play hardball with Jimmy, who is now wanted by the New York mob. He also becomes acquainted with Margaret Schroeder (Kelly Macdonald), a lovely young Irish widow who appeals to Nucky in a way his sleazy showgirl mistress does not.There are only twelve episodes of ""Boardwalk Empire Season 1,"" and somehow that's never quite enough -- they're packed with so much blood, sex, politics, murder, booze and subterfuge that it's dizzying to watch. And there are at least a dozen intricate subplots, all of which are constantly changing from one episode to the next.And the writers are unafraid to unleash some really graphic violence (head blown off, severed fingers, a shooting where the guy's BLOOD SPLATTERS ON THE CAMERA LENS), as well as exploring the ugly underbelly of this glamorized age. The dialogue is strong, quick and peppered with the F-word, and the characters are outlined carefully by the stories they often tell (such as Chalky informing a KKK jerk about how his dad died).And how do they manage to make us actually LIKE these cruel, ruthless characters like Nucky, Jimmy and Luciano? Well, just when you're preparing to hate them... they suddenly reveal a soft spot for premature babies, or they tear up about their deaf child. Steve Buscemi is absolutely wonderful as Nucky -- he's a wise-cracking, politically savvy bootlegger, but you do NOT want to cross this guy.And there are some great smaller performances by the pretty-faced Pitt, Macdonald, Shannon, Shea Wigham, Stephen Graham, and a lot of other solid actors. The one downside? Paz de la Huerta as Nucky's mistress Daisy -- she's basically there to lounge around naked in almost every scene, whining in a creepy little-girl voice about random topics.""Boardwalk Empire Season 1"" is a rich, amazingly-written slice of American history -- that is, the American history that is often glossed over because of its ugliness.

1375665,A17PNW5KFXRDT3,B003Y5HWJU,fsnva,"[3, 4]","I did not view Boardwalk Empire on its original HBO run, instead waiting until the DVD set came out and watching the show in two and three episode blocks.  But I did read many reviews when the show was airing and quite a few of them expressed disappointment that Boardwalk Empire was not the second coming of The Sopranos, or that it did not surpass that TV classic because legendary director Martin Scorsese was attached to the show since Scorsese is to the the gangster genre what John Ford was the the western.  Also many complained of the show's slow pace and how the story seemed to take a long time getting anywhere.I took all of this in mind when I sat down to watch Boardwalk Empire for myself, and I must say the critics had a point up to a point.  The first few episodes take their time introducing the characters, showing us their position in 1920's society and how they all relate to one another; the writer Terrence Winter takes care to set the stage as we are introduced to Nucky Thompson, the treasurer of Atlantic City and how his world works in 1920 at the dawn of Prohibition. By episodes 4 and 5 the stage has been set as Nucky, who controls all the bootlegging in Atlantic City plus the rum running as well, has to contend with such dangerous rivals as Arnold Rothstein and Lucky Luciano in New York and revenue agents right on his own doorstep.  As the fortunes from the illegal liquor trade pile up, so do the bodies.  By the end of the first season we have been given a ringside seat at the creation of modern organized crime in America and understand how it would prosper in the coming decades, long after Prohibition was repealed.The acting is first rate, starting with Steve Buscemi as Nucky Thompson, a man who is many things: hypocrite, accessory to murder and pillar of the community.  Buscemi has been a great actor in supporting roles for the past two decades, but he really shines as the lead here, looking like he stepped right off the front page of a 1920's newspaper; with his knowing look and sharp eyes, Buscemi never lets us forget that Nucky is always the smartest guy in the room.  I especially liked Kelly MacDonald as Margaret Shroeder, the hard luck woman who comes into Nucky's life; Margaret's story is most compelling as it portrays the often tough circumstances women found themselves in back in the supposed good old days.  There is great work by Michael Pitt as Jimmy, Nucky's less than grateful surrogate son; the always intense Michael Shannon as revenue agent Nelson Van Alden, a man way to into his work; Stephen Graham as a young Al Capone; Michael Stuhbarg as the ever too slick Arnold Rothstein, the man who fixed the World Series; Vincent Piazzia as Lucky Luciano, who hooks up at one point with Jimmy's amorous mother, played by Gretchen Mol.

With the steely sharpness of a scalpel, the writers and director manage to bring out and dissect, in haunting detail and clarity, issues of good and evil.  They dig deep into the soul and old time religion to bring out a tale that challenges the viewer as much as it does the characters in the story.  This is spellbinding entertainment that for me has created a wholly new interest in the 1930s, much like HBOs ""Rome"" created interest for me in that era (if you liked Boardwalk Empire and haven't seen Rome, you're in for another treat).  Don't listen to the naysayers about Boardwalk Empire.  It's not the Sopranos, so don't try to make it that.  But on its own and without need for comparison, this first season of Boardwalk Empire is already heading for a place among gangster classics; and stands as an original and unique addition to that genre....but what did you expect with Scorcese and Sopranos writer Terence Winter in the project?Empire may take a few shows to convince you of its brilliance and I'll grant it had a weak moment or two in a couple of the beginning episodes. One that comes to mind is The Wire's Michael K Williams (he was ""Omar"" in ""The Wire"" - another great HBO show) who plays ""Chalky"".  I come to like his character later in the show, though his initial entrance comes off too modern with the swearwords and ""from the 'hood"" attitude for the time period it's supposed be in.  Later however, he does seem to bring something of an older and different era character to his character.  Likewise for Buscemi's performance.

Or: another chapter in rep(tilian) history.Martin Scorsese and Mark Wahlberg produced this charming TV series for HBO's family program (an Italian and a Swede? Hm).Its subject is gang business during prohibition. The plot is centered in Atlantic City, with Steve Buscemi as bossman. It also branches out to New York and Chicago, with various popular local heroes such as Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, and Al Capone. Not to forget, Ponzi in Boston, but he only as a footnote.It is primarily an ethnographic expedition into the meaning of being Irish. Other tribes serve as backdrop: the Italians, Jews, African American gangsters of the time.What do you call a sober Irishman? A corpse.Buscemi's Nucky Thompson loves to spice up his public speeches with such jokes. The Irish are the backbone of his boardwalk empire. His brother is sheriff. The police force are his enforcers. Even the temperance ladies invite him to make speeches. He will follow his maxim: never let the truth stand in the way of a good story.Nucky is not only in the booze business, he holds a key role in district and state politics, controlling the Republican party machinery. Among his achievements is the support for Warren Harding for the Republican nomination. We know what became of that. Nucky knows it too. He knows that he helps to put a fool into the White House, but he needs those roads built... (it seems to me, Harding wouldn't surprise us among the current reptile batch).Aside from business and politics, on the personal level, we watch with chuckling amusement how the bossman gets erotically entangled with a widowed temperance supporter, who turns out to be less saintly than we thought. Apart from that, there is the problem that it was Nucky himself who had made her a widow. She is not supposed to find out. This is all about politics and power.Towards the end of the season finale, Nucky has won the local election for his mayoral candidate and he has made peace with the gangs of New York and Chicago, but we see an inner-Irish conspiracy against Nucky take shape. We can't wait for season 2.",5,A tale of a big tipper,1327017600,"01 20, 2012",2012,2117,"['importance', 'being', 'Irish', 'chapter', 'rep', 'tilian', 'history.Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'produced', 'charming', 'TV', 'series', 'HBO', 'family', 'program', 'Italian', 'Swede', 'Hm', '.Its', 'subject', 'gang', 'business', 'prohibition', 'plot', 'centered', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'bossman', 'also', 'out', 'New', 'York', 'Chicago', 'various', 'popular', 'local', 'heroes', 'such', 'Lucky', 'Luciano', 'Meyer', 'Lansky', 'Al', 'Capone', 'Not', 'forget', 'Ponzi', 'Boston', 'only', 'footnote.It', 'primarily', 'ethnographic', 'expedition', 'meaning', 'being', 'Irish', 'Other', 'tribes', 'serve', 'backdrop', 'Italians', 'Jews', 'African', 'American', 'gangsters', 'do', 'call', 'sober', 'Irishman', 'A', 'corpse.Buscemi', 'Nucky', 'Thompson', 'spice', 'up', 'public', 'speeches', 'such', 'jokes', 'Irish', 'are', 'backbone', 'boardwalk', 'empire', 'brother', 'sheriff', 'police', 'force', 'are', 'enforcers', 'Even', 'temperance', 'ladies', 'invite', 'make', 'speeches', 'will', 'follow', 'maxim', 'never', 'let', 'truth', 'stand', 'way', 'good', 'story.Nucky', 'not', 'only', 'booze', 'business', 'key', 'role', 'district', 'state', 'politics', 'controlling', 'Republican', 'party', 'machinery', 'achievements', 'support', 'Warren', 'Harding', 'Republican', 'nomination', 'know', 'what', 'became', 'Nucky', 'too', 'put', 'fool', 'White', 'House', 'roads', 'built', 'Harding', 'would', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'current', 'reptile', 'batch', '.Aside', 'business', 'politics', 'personal', 'level', 'watch', 'chuckling', 'amusement', 'how', 'bossman', 'erotically', 'entangled', 'widowed', 'temperance', 'supporter', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'less', 'saintly', 'thought', 'Apart', 'problem', 'was', 'Nucky', 'who', 'had', 'made', 'widow', 'not', 'supposed', 'find', 'out', 'politics', 'power.Towards', 'end', 'season', 'finale', 'Nucky', 'won', 'local', 'election', 'mayoral', 'candidate', 'made', 'peace', 'gangs', 'New', 'York', 'Chicago', 'see', 'inner-Irish', 'conspiracy', 'Nucky', 'take', 'shape', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', '2']",N/A

1375685,A1I5CATDG6B7T0,B003Y5HWJU,"Irish Rose ""Rose""","[250, 278]","When HBO first announced the showing of Boardwalk Empire, my calendar became marked with  bright red highlighter.  Every time I saw an image of actor Steve  Buscemi in his dapper 1920's attire (my favorite decade in American history), my anticipation grew.  I began to research, realizing that Martin Scorsese and producer Terry Winter (The Sopranos), and I was nearly breathless with anticipation.What drew me to Boardwalk Empire?  It was a combination of items.  I love the 1920s.  There was a romance to that particular era, evident in the films, the clothing, and the music.  America was blossoming from a gawky teenage girl and into the full flower of beauty during that magical era.  Much of the growing process involved film, music, gangsters, and Prohibition.When HBO's  BOARDWALK EMPIRE premiered, I was as giddy as a kid on Christmas morning.Scoresese and Winter didn't let me down.  Boardwalk Empire chronicles the life of Enoch (Nucky) Thompson (Steve Buscemi).  Nucky Thompson is slick, smooth, and runs the Boardwalk with a suaveness that rivals the cunning of a fox.  I don't think Scoresese could have found anyone better than Buscemi to play Thompson, for he's able to emit the perfect persona with his sly, crooked smile and darting eyes.  Yes, Buscemi fits my image of a gangster of the era, more realistic than any Hollywood has ever attempted to portray in the past.  Buscemi is not a handsome man, instead he has that down home reality to his features that makes him more believable as a human being with every close-up that is filmed.  Human is what Nucky Thompson is, aspiring for more on the boardwalk.  Nucky is complex in his greed and maneuvering, and all the while revealing the little bit of a compassionate heart that he still has beating within him.  This heart is shown in his behavior toward Margaret Schroeder (Kelly MacDonald), a pregnant woman who endures a horrific beating from her drunken husband.The storyline of Boardwalk Empire leaps from section to section, high paced, filled with action and the underground gangland activity that was so prevalent during the time.  There are startling little bits of history that will make any fan of the era and mobster history smile with pleasure.  My favorite clip was a war scarred Jimmy Darmody ( Michael Pitt) having a conversation with a very young Al Capone (Stephen Graham), while they waited to drive their bosses about town.  (No, Al Capone didn't start out his gangster career as the headman;he started at the bottom).My overall opinion of Boardwalk Empire--Excellent and stunning.  I felt as if I had been drawn into a perfectly portrayed world of the past, from the movements of Prohibition, Women's Suffrage, and into the realm of organized crime.  Beautifully written for the screen (adapted from the book by Nelson Johnson, Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City), Boardwalk Empire is a must have in your mobster collection.",5,A must have for your Mobster Video Collection,1284940800,"09 20, 2010",2010,2954,"['When', 'HBO', 'first', 'announced', 'showing', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'calendar', 'became', 'marked', 'bright', 'red', 'highlighter', 'Every', 'time', 'saw', 'image', 'actor', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'dapper', '1920', 'attire', 'favorite', 'decade', 'American', 'history', 'anticipation', 'grew', 'began', 'research', 'realizing', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'producer', 'Terry', 'Winter', 'Sopranos', 'was', 'nearly', 'breathless', 'drew', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'was', 'combination', 'items', 'love', '1920s', 'was', 'romance', 'particular', 'era', 'evident', 'films', 'clothing', 'music', 'America', 'was', 'blossoming', 'gawky', 'teenage', 'girl', 'full', 'flower', 'beauty', 'magical', 'era', 'Much', 'growing', 'process', 'involved', 'film', 'music', 'gangsters', 'Prohibition.When', 'HBO', 'BOARDWALK', 'EMPIRE', 'premiered', 'was', 'as', 'giddy', 'kid', 'Christmas', 'morning.Scoresese', 'Winter', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'life', 'Enoch', 'Nucky', 'Thompson', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Nucky', 'Thompson', 'slick', 'smooth', 'Boardwalk', 'suaveness', 'cunning', 'fox', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Scoresese', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'anyone', 'better', 'Buscemi', 'play', 'Thompson', 'able', 'emit', 'perfect', 'persona', 'sly', 'crooked', 'smile', 'darting', 'eyes', 'Yes', 'Buscemi', 'image', 'gangster', 'era', 'more', 'realistic', 'Hollywood', 'ever', 'attempted', 'portray', 'past', 'Buscemi', 'not', 'handsome', 'man', 'instead', 'down', 'home', 'reality', 'features', 'more', 'believable', 'human', 'being', 'close-up', 'filmed', 'Human', 'what', 'Nucky', 'Thompson', 'aspiring', 'more', 'boardwalk', 'Nucky', 'complex', 'greed', 'maneuvering', 'while', 'revealing', 'little', 'bit', 'compassionate', 'heart', 'still', 'beating', 'heart', 'shown', 'behavior', 'Margaret', 'Schroeder', 'Kelly', 'MacDonald', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'who', 'horrific', 'beating', 'drunken', 'husband.The', 'storyline', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'section', 'section', 'high', 'paced', 'filled', 'action', 'underground', 'gangland', 'activity', 'was', 'so', 'prevalent', 'time', 'are', 'startling', 'little', 'bits', 'history', 'will', 'make', 'fan', 'era', 'mobster', 'history', 'smile', 'pleasure', 'favorite', 'clip', 'was', 'war', 'scarred', 'Jimmy', 'Darmody', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'having', 'conversation', 'very', 'young', 'Al', 'Capone', 'Stephen', 'Graham', 'waited', 'drive', 'bosses', 'town', 'No', 'Al', 'Capone', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'out', 'gangster', 'career', 'headman', 'started', 'bottom', 'overall', 'opinion', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'Excellent', 'stunning', 'felt', 'had', 'been', 'drawn', 'perfectly', 'portrayed', 'world', 'past', 'movements', 'Prohibition', 'Women', 'Suffrage', 'realm', 'organized', 'crime', 'Beautifully', 'written', 'screen', 'adapted', 'book', 'Nelson', 'Johnson', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'Birth', 'High', 'Times', 'Corruption', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'must', 'have', 'mobster', 'collection']",N/A

1375688,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B003Y5HWJU,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[0, 0]","I was born and raised in Atlantic City way before the casinos took over the town. Atlantic City was once an elegant place for both tourists and citizens of the town. With its grand hotels, beautiful architecture, popular boarding houses, and many restaurants for rich and poor alike, it provided a spot where tourists could take the sea air and enjoy themselves walking on the boardwalk. It was also a wonderful small town in which to grow up...a town which essentially remained small. The population diminished significantly after Labor Day when the &#34;season&#34; was over for the year to begin once more during the Memorial Day weekend.I went to high school there, as did my parents, aunts, uncles and cousins, generations before me. The historic high school, where so many learned, was one of the places demolished to make room for the casinos, hotels and their tasteless themes. The old high school is now an asphalt parking lot.I was always fascinated by Atlantic City's history, especially the time of Prohibition, where gangsters smuggled illegal &#34;booze&#34; to speakeasies and to the rich who could afford the price of the very expensive alcohol...at least the real kind...not the white lightening brands.So I was surprised and delighted when HBO, and screen writer Terence Winter, (creator of &#34;The Sopranos),&#34; along with co-producer and director Martin Scorsese, took on &#34;Boardwalk Empire&#34; as an HBO project. Mr. Scorsese was involved in the filming even before creator Terence Winter. He directed the pilot and established the seamless look of the show. He is also one of the executive producers of the series. The series is based on the book &#34;Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times and Corruption of Atlantic City&#34; by Nelson Johnson. This fictionalized version of &#34;Nucky&#34; Johnson, here called Nucky Thomson, gave the writers creative license with history in order to maintain suspense. One great difference between the real Johnson and the fictional Thompson is that the real Johnson is not known to have killed anyone personally, as the fictional Thompson has done; there is also no evidence that Johnson ever ordered someone to be killed. There may be no evidence, however he still might have murdered people who got in his way.&#34;Nucky&#34; Thompson is very well portrayed by Steve Buscemi. Thompson, a political boss and racketeer from the 1910s until his imprisonment in 1941, was the undisputed &#34;boss&#34; of the political machine that controlled Atlantic City and the Atlantic County government. He rose to prominence as county treasurer during the 1920s and 1930s, a position which allowed him to control the county's purse strings. He was also county collector. Nucky interacts with several historical figures in both his personal and political life, including mobsters, politicians, government agents, and the common folk who looked up to him. He is portrayed here as Nucky Johnson once was, a slick politician , with no compunction about doing anything, including &#34;knocking off, (supposedly not true in real life), his enemies and those who stood in the way of his ambitions and enormous ego. He was a man who considered himself &#34;entitled.&#34;Atlantic City was the above mentioned tourist destination, and city leaders knew that its success as a resort depended on providing visitors with what they wanted and what many tourists wanted was the opportunity to drink, gamble and fornicate. Therefore, the organization inherited by Johnson permitted the service of alcohol (prohibited by New Jersey law), gambling and prostitution, in exchange for the payment of protection money by vice industry operators to the organization. Thompson's power reached its zenith during Prohibition, which was enacted nationally in 1919, (but did not go into effect until 1920), and lasted until 1933. Prohibition was effectively unenforced in Atlantic City, and, as a result, the resort's popularity grew further. The city then dubbed itself as &#34;The World's Playground&#34;. Most of Thompson's income came from the percentage he took on every gallon of illegal liquor sold. Unfortunately for Nucky he had to deal with equally violent rivals and determined FBI prohibition agents..His personal trademark was a red carnation, fresh daily, worn in his lapel. At the height of his power, Johnson lived in a suite of rooms on the ninth floor of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, located on the Boardwalk. The Ritz, which opened in 1921, was where Johnson hosted many lavish parties. He always carried a large wad of cash and freely gave to those in need. He was widely beloved by local citizens, among whom his benevolence and generosity were legendary.Being a character based drama this obviously relied heavily on its cast and it was here that this opening season excelled. Lead by the always excellent Steve Buscemi the supporting cast were equally as successful at bringing the interesting characters and plots to life.Here the viewer learns the story of a twenties gang called &#34;The Combined or Big Seven Group.&#34; All the biggies on the east coast were part of it and it was multicultural, as crime is. Seven different gangs: Sicilian, Italian, Jewish, and Irish came together to bring people booze during Prohibition. Also, a little bit of smack or &#34;something in the sack,&#34; they were a very diverse lot. It was the precursor to the National Crime Syndicate of the 1930s. The Big Seven was Charles &#34;Lucky&#34; Luciano's and Meyer Lansky&#8217;s operations as well as  Enoch &#34;Nucky&#34; Johnson and Abner &#34;Longy&#34; Zwillman&#8217;s outfits from New Jersey, Moe Dalitz from Cleveland, Waxey Gordon and Harry &#34;Nig&#34; Rosen of Philadelphia, Danny Walsh represented for Providence, Rhode Island. Johnny Torrio was a kind of consigliere but a young Capone was too busy dealing with the North Side Gang. However, Capone did attend the Atlantic City Conference of 1929. And Giuseppe Masseria was best known as &#34;Joe the Boss,&#34; was also known as &#34;the man who can dodge bullets&#34; because he survived a multi-gun execution attempt on Bowery.Important characters who almost  always return season after season include:Obviously Nucky Thompson, (Steve Buscemi), the corrupt treasurer of Atlantic County and its most powerful political figure.James &#34;Jimmy&#34; Darmody, (Michael Pitt) a former Princeton student who served in World War I. After returning home, Jimmy, who is like a son to Nucky, is hired by Thompson as his driver.Margaret Thompson, (Kelly Macdonald), formerly Schroeder, n&eacute;e Rohan, is a young Irish widow and mother. She turns to Nucky for help and eventually becomes a very important figure in Thompson's life.Nelson Van Alden / George Mueller, (Michael Shannon), a former Prohibition federal agent on the run after committing a heinous crime. Under the alias George Mueller, he inadvertently gets caught up in the conflict between mafioso characters.Elias &#34;Eli&#34; Thompson, (Shea Whigham),  Nucky's younger brother and sheriff of Atlantic County.Jack Huston, (Richard Harrow), a former Army marksman who allies with Jimmy and later Nucky. Disfigured during the war, he wears a mask over half of his face. He is one of my favorite characters.Gillian Darmody, (Gretchen Mol), Jimmy's mother and an old friend of Nucky's. She is beautiful, very saavy about power and runs a house of &#34;ill repute' but a very classy one. She is also Luciano's former lover.Albert &#34;Chalky&#34; White, (Michael Kenneth Williams), Nucky's counterpart in Atlantic City's black community.Angela Darmody, (Aleksa Palladino), Jimmy's wife and the mother of his young son.A major part of the series includes the story of a twenties gang called &#34;The Combined&#34; or &#34;Big Seven Group.&#34;  The biggies on the east coast were part of it and it was multicultural, as crime is. Seven different gangs: Sicilian, Italian, Jewish, and Irish came together to bring people booze during Prohibition. They also brought a little bit of smack or &#34;something in the sack.&#34; This group was the precursor to the National Crime Syndicate of the 1930s. The Big Seven was Charles &#34;Lucky&#34; Luciano, (Vincent Piazza), and Meyer Lansky&#8217;s, (Anatol Yusef), operations as well as  Enoch &#34;Nucky&#34; Johnson and Abner &#34;Longy&#34; Zwillman&#8217;s, (uncredited), outfits from New Jersey, Moe Dalitz, (uncredited), from Cleveland, Waxey Gordon, (Nick Sandow), and Harry &#34;Nig&#34; Rosen (uncredited), of Philadelphia, Danny Walsh, (uncredited), representative for Providence, Rhode Island.

And Giuseppe Masseria, ( Anthony Quinn ), was best known as &#34;Joe the Boss.&#34; He was also known as &#34;the man who can dodge bullets&#34; because he survived a multi-gun execution attempt on Bowery.I highly recommend this gripping series, especially as it is now available on DVD.

In fact, all of the cast did a fine job. The writers also wrote great scripts for the first season of Boardwalk Empire.  However the reason I purchased this is to see my favorite New York actor, Johnnie Mae.  She portrayed Luanne, the Commodore's housekeeper.  The Commodore is portrayed by Dabney Coleman.  Johnnie Mae commands the screen every time she's on it.  She appears to be beaten down and subservient to the Commodore but you can tell something's simmering beneath the surface.  The Commodore speaks abusively to her.  ""He treats that dog better than me!"" she mutters.  If looks could kill, you know the Commodore would be roasting in hell.  At a time when African Americans were expected to bow and scrape and grin and bear the abuse they received from bigots it was no wonder Luanne got fed up with the Commodore's treatment.  Whoever wrote those lines for her when she was asked why she did a certain thing is a genius.  But the manner in which Johnnie Mae delivered the lines will not soon be forgotten.  ""Because if I'd used a shotgun I would've had to clean up the mess myself!""  Now, that's a woman who just wasn't going to take it anymore.

1375692,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B003Y5HWJU,Jason Bean,"[1, 1]","If cable TV crime shows had a template for success then 'Boardwalk Empire' hits on every mark. The high-production values, the strong writing and performances, a more than decent amount of nudity and violence, this show has everything you'd expect from a big-budget production on HBO. Unfortunately Boardwalk Empire doesn't do a whole lot different either and at times it stumbles for it's own identity.If there's one time period I'll always find engaging it's the roaring 20's and 'Boardwalk Empire's' setting in Atlantic City as Prohibition comes into effect is an engaging one. Enoch ""Nucky"" Thompson is the county treasurer  who has his hands in politics and bootlegging. His driver, Jimmy Darmody is a 22 year old WWI vet who's adjusting to life at home and wants to have more power and status with Nucky. Both these characters run into prohibition agent Nelson Van Alden who's religious beliefs fuel his determination (and brutality) to bring law and order. The overall plot sees these characters forming alliances and relationships, making power-plays and questioning their own actions. This season stays interesting to watch and certainly kicks things into gear in it's final episodes but I can't say there's anything in the character or story developments that I haven't seen in shows like Deadwood, Rome or Brotherhood.While the narrative may not be that original the performances go a long way to selling the stories. Steve Buscemi has always been an excellent actor and he's terrific playing the morally ambiguous Nucky. Kelly Macdonald matches him as Margaret Schroeder, an Irish mother who comes to Nucky for help and ends up getting sucked into his world. Van Alden seems an easy target and not that convincing as an antagnonist but Michael Shannon raises him above the usual religious cop archetype and is always fun to watch. It took a few episodes to warm up to Michael Pitt as Jimmy, which I could blame on him being a distant character but at the end I'm very interested to see what the show does with his character.Along with the outstanding set pieces which draw you into 'Boardwalk Empire's' time period, the music stands as the show's greatest accomplishment! The opening is easily HBO's best theme and while the music may seem a little out-of place (most of it's re-recorded) but it's always rousing and really brings the show to life.Boardwalk Empire' may not do anything new for HBO (or crime dramas in general) but what it DOES do it does well.

All discs and special features play fine now.The blu-ray video/audio on each disc in the package is superb.  I grew up near Atlantic City and lived in the same town as the author of the book.  I cannot tell you the pleasure I felt when I first saw the Blueberry Capital of the World sign in the first couple of minutes of episode 1. My sister still lives ""near mile marker 14 on the Black Horse.""  Mr. Buscemi has never been better and amply fills the saddle wing tips he wears.  The actors, creative talent, and HBO have done an outstanding job on this series and blu-ray set.  I hope Mr. Scorsese does more television projects.As with many blu-ray DVDs, HBO included a small insert that said the discs were manufactured to the highest quality standards.  I agree.  They are not defective.  If they don't play correctly, your player probably needs a software/firmware update and the player's manufacturer may not have the update available for download yet.  My Sony BDP-S580 updated with Nov 30, 2011 update could not play the discs, my LG 630 updated with Dec 1, 2011 update could not play them.  I was frustrated as many reviewers were.  I even exchanged my set for another and had the same freezing problems (I could only select Play All (no features played), if you think yours works correctly select Picture in Picture and see if it plays past third event in first episode).  However, my Samsung BD-5700 downloaded an update with 1022 in the numbers and there it was - Boardwalk Empire played correctly, all menus were listed, each episode was correctly identified in the menus.

He is a widower, who can seem to never get past the love he had for his wife, so fills that void with Lucy Danziger, a former Ziegfeid Follies dancer and other call girls.All that changes when a pregnant Margaret Schroeder (Kelly Macdonald) comes to see him. She is obviously a victim of abuse, but sincerely just wants Nucky to help her husband find a job, thinking his drinking and carousing would stop. Instead Nucky gives her money, which she hides, her husband finds, and beats her causing her to lose the baby.Nucky has him killed and begins a slow, awkward romance with the young Irish widow. Problems begin to surface when she pushes her pro-prohibition stance, her dislike for corrupt politics and doubt that Nucky has honorable intentions.Another central character is James ""Jimmy"" Darmody (Michael Pitt) who returns from World War I with a bum leg, works for Nucky awhile before embarking on his own into organized crime.Filled with complex characters, brilliant photography and editing, Boardwalk Empire is sure to be the new Sopranos.On October 12, 2011 it was announced that the series has been renewed for a third season.",4,HBO'series unveils mystical world of 1920 + prohibition,1331683200,"03 14, 2012",2012,1758,"['Jim', 'Clark', 'publisher', 'Lee', 'County', 'Courier', 'Tupelo', 'MSBoardwalk', 'Empire', 'unflinching', 'look', 'historical', 'criminal', 'kingpin', 'Enoch', 'Nucky', 'Johnson', 'Nelson', 'Johnson', 'empire', 'ruled', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'New', 'Jersey', 'prohibition.The', 'first', 'episode', 'directed', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'most', 'expensive', 'pilot', 'episode', 'produced', 'television', 'history', 'final', 'cost', '18', 'million.In', 'real', 'life', 'Nucky', 'ruled', '1910', 'was', 'imprisoned', '1941', 'Income', 'Tax', 'evasion.Nucky', 'treasurer', 'Alantic', 'County', 'powerful', 'political', 'figure', 'who', 'tabs', 'everything', 'always', 'sure', 'cut', 'widower', 'who', 'can', 'seem', 'never', 'get', 'love', 'had', 'wife', 'so', 'void', 'Lucy', 'Danziger', 'former', 'Ziegfeid', 'Follies', 'dancer', 'other', 'call', 'girls.All', 'when', 'pregnant', 'Margaret', 'Schroeder', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'see', 'obviously', 'victim', 'abuse', 'sincerely', 'just', 'Nucky', 'help', 'husband', 'find', 'job', 'thinking', 'drinking', 'carousing', 'would', 'stop', 'Instead', 'Nucky', 'money', 'husband', 'finds', 'causing', 'lose', 'baby.Nucky', 'killed', 'slow', 'awkward', 'romance', 'young', 'Irish', 'widow', 'Problems', 'begin', 'surface', 'when', 'pro-prohibition', 'stance', 'dislike', 'corrupt', 'politics', 'doubt', 'Nucky', 'honorable', 'intentions.Another', 'central', 'character', 'James', 'Jimmy', 'Darmody', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'who', 'returns', 'World', 'War', 'bum', 'leg', 'Nucky', 'awhile', 'embarking', 'own', 'organized', 'crime.Filled', 'complex', 'characters', 'brilliant', 'photography', 'editing', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'sure', 'be', 'new', 'Sopranos.On', 'October', '12', '2011', 'was', 'announced', 'series', 'been', 'renewed', 'third', 'season']",N/A

1375707,A2B0DPQK20LYYJ,B003Y5HWJU,J. Michael,"[2, 2]","Boardwalk Empire is a mixed bag, typical of HBO's usual strengths and flaws. On the plus side, it sets its story in a fascinating and relatively unexamined period of history, the American 1920s, and focuses on types of people we are interested to know more intimately: the gangsters made prominent and powerful by Prohibition, the corrupt political bosses who profited from the illicit liquor trade, the agents sworn to enforce the law, World War I veterans, and the ordinary folk who lived through it all. The re-creation of the era's material and musical culture is extraordinary, at least to my layman's eye and ear. The acting is top notch all around, with some really_incredible_performances from little-known or unfairly discounted actors. So, what are the things that hobble this series?*Discordant notes become noticeable immediately. When even little things don't ring true, they undermine the verisimilitude of a drama. In the first place was the language. With the exception of an occasional 1920's phrase shoehorned into the dialogue, the characters speak exactly like modern Americans. And sure, there was profanity in 1919, but not like this, with almost every character speaking like the lowest ghetto rat from 2010. That wasn't necessary or historical. Then there were the sociological oddities: an Irish-Catholic Republican politician (named Enoch!) who was a darling of the Ku Klux Klan, and who began an affair with an immigrant, hymn-singing, Irish-Catholic temperance activist. Such ahistorical types may have actually existed, but all dramatists know that there are just some truths that would be laughed off the stage for being too far-fetched.*The plot quickly descends into desperate melodrama that would shame a Mexican telenovela. I suppose the writers simply had no idea where they wanted to take the story, so they habitually resort to every kind of salacious, over-the-top, meretricious plot twist: incest, pedophilia, parricide, lesbianism, assassinations, massacres, executions, gun battles, unexpected illnesses, torture, miscarriages, mutilations, bombings, adulteries, betrayals, sado-masochism, and the old standby, HBO's perennial obsession, whorehouses and naked prostitutes galore. This adolescent writing is all so gratuitous and contrived that it drags the series down to a level of almost cartoonish caricature.*Everyone, and I mean everyone, in this series is evil. Even the ""sympathetic"" character of Margaret has a false rape accusation, robbery, adultery, fornication, an abortion, and after-the-fact complicity in her husband's murder on her moral ledger. No one is really trying to rise above the mire, so what it all amounts to is a bunch of evil people doing evil things and trying to backstab everyone else. At one point it was hinted at that our protagonist Enoch Thompson might have some hidden moral depth when his mistress declares that it's her job to seduce him away from heeding the Catholic guilt that afflicts him every so often, but that plot development was totally discarded, leaving a completely superficial character who does nothing but pursue money and power.The series has enough to make it entertaining, with an all-star cast and brilliant cinematography and costumery, but maybe HBO should think about employing some writers older than 15 years old.",4,A great conception marred by discordant notes and ham-handed execution,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",2013,3319,"['Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'mixed', 'bag', 'typical', 'HBO', 'usual', 'strengths', 'flaws', 'plus', 'side', 'story', 'fascinating', 'relatively', 'unexamined', 'period', 'history', 'American', '1920s', 'types', 'people', 'are', 'interested', 'know', 'more', 'intimately', 'gangsters', 'made', 'prominent', 'powerful', 'Prohibition', 'corrupt', 'political', 'bosses', 'who', 'profited', 'illicit', 'liquor', 'trade', 'agents', 'sworn', 'enforce', 'law', 'World', 'War', 'veterans', 'ordinary', 'folk', 'who', 'lived', 're-creation', 'era', 'material', 'musical', 'culture', 'extraordinary', 'least', 'layman', 'eye', 'ear', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'really_incredible_performances', 'little-known', 'unfairly', 'discounted', 'actors', 'So', 'what', 'are', 'things', 'hobble', 'series', '*Discordant', 'notes', 'become', 'noticeable', 'immediately', 'When', 'even', 'little', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'undermine', 'verisimilitude', 'drama', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'language', 'exception', 'occasional', '1920', 'phrase', 'shoehorned', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'speak', 'exactly', 'modern', 'Americans', 'sure', 'was', 'profanity', '1919', 'not', 'almost', 'character', 'speaking', 'lowest', 'ghetto', 'rat', '2010', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'historical', 'Then', 'were', 'sociological', 'oddities', 'Irish-Catholic', 'Republican', 'politician', 'named', 'Enoch', 'who', 'was', 'darling', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'who', 'began', 'affair', 'immigrant', 'hymn-singing', 'Irish-Catholic', 'temperance', 'activist', 'Such', 'ahistorical', 'types', 'may', 'have', 'actually', 'existed', 'dramatists', 'know', 'are', 'just', 'truths', 'would', 'be', 'laughed', 'off', 'stage', 'being', 'too', 'far-fetched', '*The', 'plot', 'quickly', 'desperate', 'melodrama', 'would', 'shame', 'Mexican', 'telenovela', 'suppose', 'writers', 'simply', 'had', 'idea', 'where', 'wanted', 'take', 'story', 'habitually', 'resort', 'kind', 'salacious', 'over-the-top', 'meretricious', 'plot', 'twist', 'incest', 'pedophilia', 'parricide', 'lesbianism', 'assassinations', 'massacres', 'executions', 'gun', 'battles', 'unexpected', 'illnesses', 'torture', 'miscarriages', 'mutilations', 'bombings', 'adulteries', 'betrayals', 'sado-masochism', 'old', 'standby', 'HBO', 'perennial', 'obsession', 'whorehouses', 'naked', 'prostitutes', 'galore', 'adolescent', 'writing', 'so', 'gratuitous', 'contrived', 'series', 'down', 'level', 'almost', 'cartoonish', 'caricature', '*Everyone', 'mean', 'everyone', 'series', 'evil', 'Even', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Margaret', 'false', 'rape', 'accusation', 'robbery', 'adultery', 'fornication', 'abortion', 'after-the-fact', 'complicity', 'husband', 'murder', 'moral', 'ledger', 'one', 'really', 'trying', 'rise', 'mire', 'what', 'amounts', 'bunch', 'evil', 'people', 'doing', 'evil', 'things', 'trying', 'backstab', 'everyone', 'else', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'hinted', 'protagonist', 'Enoch', 'Thompson', 'might', 'have', 'hidden', 'moral', 'depth', 'when', 'mistress', 'job', 'seduce', 'away', 'heeding', 'Catholic', 'guilt', 'so', 'often', 'plot', 'development', 'was', 'totally', 'discarded', 'leaving', 'completely', 'superficial', 'character', 'who', 'nothing', 'pursue', 'money', 'power.The', 'series', 'enough', 'make', 'entertaining', 'all-star', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'costumery', 'maybe', 'HBO', 'should', 'think', 'employing', 'writers', 'older', '15', 'years', 'old']",N/A

1375722,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B003Y5HWJU,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[84, 99]","The writer of the HBO series, Terence Winter (who also wrote the foreword for this edition of the book), was recently interviewed on public radio and explained how and why the HBO show deviates from many of the facts in the book ""Boardwalk Empire."" Last names were sometimes changed and certain information had to be imagined or created in order to allow the plot to veer away from the events in the book. Hence,  Nucky ""Thompson"" in the series is actually based on the real life Nucky (Enoch) JohnsonNone of this takes away from the entertainment value of the series but potential buyers of the book will get an added perspective and accurate historical detail.""Boardwalk Empire"" is an excellent way to round out the very entertaining cable television series. If you simply want to watch the show, it recreates Atlantic City in its heyday. Steve Buscemi is riveting in his role as ""Nucky"" and comes across as a complex person, although when it comes to business he can be harsh and no nonsense. Things go his way or else. Of course, I write this after seeing only the first episodes of the series so it will be interesting to see how his character evolves. There are hints of a romance in the future.Not surprisingly, Terence Winter (again, writer of the HBO series) also wrote many episodes of The Sopranos and director Martin Scorcese steps to the helm and directs the first and possibly many more episodes of the cable show ( but guest directors aren't uncommon for cable series). In the show, Steve Buscemi plays Nucky but Winter has admitted that James Gandolfini would have fit the actual body type and appearance of Nucky. But because Buscemi captures the essence of Nucky so well it doesn't seem to matter if he looks exactly like the real Nucky.Nucky Johnson provides what people want, primarily alcohol, gambling and sex. But if the public had wanted other things Nucky would simply have gone with public sentiment. His choices were based on what brought him the most profit -and it was as simple as that, although being in power was not so simple.Having seen the first episodes of the series, I am able to compare both the book and television show. I'd urge you to buy the book. Both the book and the cable series made me yearn to visit Atlantic City in its prime. Women dressed in their finest outfits before strolling on the actual boardwalk. I'd love to have revisited that time - if only to understand the thrills that drew people to Atlantic City.Since I've now seen the series, it is impossible to write about the book without comparing it to the film version. I have to admit that the HBO show recreates Atlantic City's mixture of people and often weird attractions, from side shows to palm readers - and it does make a difference seeing and hearing the combination of sights, sounds and dialogue.There is also a portrayal of the young Al Capone and he comes off as far less confident in his youth. He still takes risks but he hasn't matured into the experienced man whose name became legend.""Boardwalk Empire"" reveals how the area was a place where families came, with children enjoying themselves by day and adults venturing off to enjoy other pursuits at night. You won't get a truly balanced historical take on Atlantic City without reading the book and the series should motivate viewers to want to learn more about the history of Atlantic City's entertainment area.Reading ""Boardwalk Empire"" is well worth the time. But if you only want to watch the show you will still get a limitd sense of the sights and sounds of Atlantic City as well as the lure of booze, women and gambling.",5,"Based on the book ""Boardwalk Empire"" and well worth watching even though some facts have been changed",1285632000,"09 28, 2010",2010,3605,"['writer', 'HBO', 'series', 'Terence', 'Winter', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'foreword', 'edition', 'book', 'was', 'recently', 'interviewed', 'public', 'radio', 'explained', 'how', 'why', 'HBO', 'show', 'many', 'facts', 'book', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'Last', 'names', 'were', 'sometimes', 'changed', 'certain', 'information', 'had', 'be', 'imagined', 'created', 'order', 'allow', 'plot', 'veer', 'away', 'events', 'book', 'Hence', 'Nucky', 'Thompson', 'series', 'actually', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'Nucky', 'Enoch', 'JohnsonNone', 'away', 'entertainment', 'value', 'series', 'potential', 'buyers', 'book', 'will', 'get', 'added', 'perspective', 'accurate', 'historical', 'detail', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'excellent', 'way', 'round', 'out', 'very', 'entertaining', 'cable', 'television', 'series', 'simply', 'want', 'watch', 'show', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'heyday', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'riveting', 'role', 'Nucky', 'across', 'complex', 'person', 'when', 'business', 'can', 'be', 'harsh', 'nonsense', 'Things', 'go', 'way', 'else', 'course', 'write', 'seeing', 'only', 'first', 'episodes', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'character', 'evolves', 'are', 'hints', 'romance', 'future.Not', 'surprisingly', 'Terence', 'Winter', 'again', 'writer', 'HBO', 'series', 'also', 'wrote', 'many', 'episodes', 'Sopranos', 'director', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'steps', 'helm', 'first', 'possibly', 'many', 'more', 'episodes', 'cable', 'show', 'guest', 'directors', 'are', ""n't"", 'uncommon', 'cable', 'series', 'show', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Nucky', 'Winter', 'admitted', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'actual', 'body', 'type', 'appearance', 'Nucky', 'Buscemi', 'essence', 'Nucky', 'so', 'well', ""n't"", 'seem', 'matter', 'exactly', 'real', 'Nucky.Nucky', 'Johnson', 'what', 'people', 'want', 'primarily', 'alcohol', 'gambling', 'sex', 'public', 'had', 'wanted', 'other', 'things', 'Nucky', 'would', 'simply', 'have', 'gone', 'public', 'sentiment', 'choices', 'were', 'based', 'what', 'brought', 'most', 'profit', '-and', 'was', 'as', 'simple', 'being', 'power', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'simple.Having', 'seen', 'first', 'episodes', 'series', 'am', 'able', 'compare', 'book', 'television', 'show', ""'d"", 'urge', 'buy', 'book', 'book', 'cable', 'series', 'made', 'yearn', 'visit', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'prime', 'Women', 'dressed', 'finest', 'outfits', 'strolling', 'actual', 'boardwalk', ""'d"", 'love', 'have', 'revisited', 'time', 'only', 'understand', 'thrills', 'drew', 'people', 'Atlantic', 'City.Since', ""'ve"", 'now', 'seen', 'series', 'impossible', 'write', 'book', 'comparing', 'film', 'version', 'have', 'admit', 'HBO', 'show', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'mixture', 'people', 'often', 'weird', 'attractions', 'side', 'shows', 'palm', 'readers', 'make', 'difference', 'seeing', 'hearing', 'combination', 'sights', 'sounds', 'dialogue.There', 'also', 'portrayal', 'young', 'Al', 'Capone', 'off', 'far', 'less', 'confident', 'youth', 'still', 'risks', ""n't"", 'matured', 'experienced', 'man', 'name', 'became', 'legend', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'how', 'area', 'was', 'place', 'where', 'families', 'came', 'children', 'enjoying', 'day', 'adults', 'venturing', 'off', 'enjoy', 'other', 'pursuits', 'night', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'truly', 'balanced', 'historical', 'take', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'reading', 'book', 'series', 'should', 'motivate', 'viewers', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'history', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'entertainment', 'area.Reading', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'well', 'time', 'only', 'want', 'watch', 'show', 'will', 'still', 'get', 'limitd', 'sense', 'sights', 'sounds', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'as', 'well', 'lure', 'booze', 'women', 'gambling']",N/A

1375726,A3KDVSFMPMXSRO,B003Y5HWJU,Kevin F. Tasker,"[3, 4]","Boardwalk Empire is a brilliantly-produced, profane, misogynistic and at times incredibly brutal TV show. True to HBO standards, most episodes include at least one instance of mind-shattering violence (see a particularly explosive headshot in the first episode) and graphic sexuality. Beyond these adult-TV 'staples,' the show is filled to the brim with freakishly good entertainment. The environments are marvelously detailed. The boardwalk sizzles with seedy glitz and depth. The costumes, from gangster suits to flapper dresses, are period appropriate and striking. The actors are supremely talented, save Steve Buscemi who more or less sticks out like a sore thumb. He possesses little of the grit or dirty fervor we might expect from a name like Nucky. Still, he is off-set by the electric Michael Pitt and the very talented Kelly McDonald whose temperance movement widow performance is one of the best female leads in recent memory (and the show's only female lead of note, providing the only empathetic center for progressive audience members...and women in general). Michael Shannon is also excellent, playing the role he always plays: the stoic, frightening creep! Only this time he wears a fedora and searches for boozers wherever they may dwell. He performs an interrogation at one point that makes 24's Jack Bauer tame by comparison. For anyone interesting in prohibition era gangster culture and not turned off by violence, profanity and a good bit of Non-PC dialogue/situations (including a few nasty 'dwarf' boxing matches and lots of derogatory language toward ladies), this is one show you ought not miss.

1375727,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003Y5HWJU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[16, 19]","Certainly one of the most eagerly anticipated shows on the 2010 television schedule, HBO's ""Boardwalk Empire"" boasted the year's most impressive pedigree with Martin Scorsese taking a production credit and even directing the pilot episode. This brain child of Terrence Winter, a primary creative force and writer for ""The Sopranos,"" adapts the Nelson Johnson non-fiction work chronicling the sordid history of Atlantic City into a masterful blend of fact and fantasy. Embraced by mainstream critics and viewers alike, ""Boardwalk Empire"" recently picked up a Golden Globe for Best Dramatic Program and acting honors for lead Steve Buscemi at both the Globes and the SAG awards. Intended for adult audiences, this is a program whose real pleasures unfold as the season progresses--it has a slow build momentum and a subtlety in plotting and characterizations that might not appeal to more action oriented viewers. But patience is rewarded with a rich and compelling storyline that showcases equal parts politics and mob drama.Buscemi plays Nucky Thompson, the most pivotal power player of this corrupt political empire. The charming Thompson rules Atlantic City as if he were its king! Set in the prohibition era, Thompson plays both the peacemaker and the enforcer--but in this turbulent time, keeping a tight grip on the city proves to pose some dangerous challenges. Backed by his muscle (Michael Pitt), pursued doggedly by a federal agent (Michael Shannon), and tentatively romancing a recent widow (Kelly Macdonald)--Buscemi does not play Thompson as a one dimensional villain, but instead as a multi-layered businessman. Within this fictional backdrop (yes, I know Thompson was a real person), other notorious real life personages populate the cast such as Al Capone and Lucky Luciano. This is a startlingly realistic portrait of the outlaw days of prohibition!In addition to Buscemi's fine work, the cast is uniformly excellent. At first, I thought Pitt a bit passive in the role of a henchman but his independence and intelligence start to emerge until he becomes more of an equal and less of an underling. Macdonald, as well, starts as a fairly tentative character but she experiences the story's most compelling transformation. At first she is seduced by the Thompson's clout, than complicit, than free to experience a newfound power of her own. Shannon is creepy menace in what could have been the show's most conventionally good character. But I also really liked Gretchen Mol (Pitt's mother although in real life she is only 9 years his senior), Shea Wigham (Buscemi's brother), Vincent Piazza (Lucky Luciano) and Jack Huston (as a disfigured vet who befriends Pitt). But really, all the supporting roles are played with verve and I could easily have listed an additional four or five actors that stand out.In some ways, On-demand or DVD is the perfect venue to catch ""Boardwalk Empire"" where you can allow the story to flow at your own rate. Intelligent and challenging, this isn't a slam bang gangster melodrama. It is a character driven piece occupied by perhaps the most morally ambiguous cast of characters ever assembled for a television program. No one is unscathed in this period saga! At this juncture, it is also noteworthy to include that the production values really do recreate an era gone by. Gorgeous to look at and authentically believable, this is smart and sophisticated entertainment!

HBO and the producers of the series deserve major credit for bringing in the series the ""anything goes"" era of Prohibition vividly and indelibly to light.  I also think Steven Buscemi's portrayal of gangster/crooked politician Enoch ""Nucky"" Thompson is little short of brilliant.  Nucky is an even more fascinating character than Tony Soprano (and that's saying a lot).  He's a man capable of great kindness, charm, and decency but at the same time, is able to order murders, engage in law-breaking on a massive scale, make a mockery out of ""good government,"" and pimp a girl barely into her teens to his former mentor ""the Commodore"" (played by Dabney Coleman).The series is not perfect.  For example, Nucky's nemesis, Agent Van Alden, commits a murder in front of dozens of witnesses and somehow no one talks or even whispers about the crime.  Nucky's former girlfriend Lucy Danziger has the potential to become very annoying with her rather sing-song bimbo's voice.  But that's more the compensated for by the compelling characters that dominate the story, most notably Margaret Schroeder, Nucky's apparent soul-mate who loves the good in Nucky and turns a blind eye to the evil in a manner that Carmela Soprano of ""the Sopranos"" could easily recognize.Another thing people need to understand about ""Boardwalk Empire"" is that it easily crosses  into R and even sometimes NC-17 territory.  We see someone cut someone else's throat and see the victim choking to death on his own blood.  There is a sex scene late in the season that is probably the most explicit thing I've ever seen on HBO.  So I wouldn't let any young kids watch it...but then, the show's not really for them.So if you want to learn a bit about a bygone era in which an effort to legislate morality gave birth to the mob with a vengeance, rent, buy, or watch on HBO ""Boardwalk Empire.""

Some have expressed dislike for the slow storylines and pacing as well as what I've heard described as a weaker season long arc. I personally find the show to be fantastic and the pacing is refreshing and suits the atmosphere being created in 1920's Atlantic City. The Sopranos itself was a slower paced show if one really looks back on it, the deaths come but only at the leisure of the story. The one thing that cannot be contested in regards to this show is the production value, the boardwalk they've created, the sets, the period costumes and the sheer amount of quality casting/acting that fill this universe. The story also spans from Atlantic City to New York and Chicago. It's an amazing feat that they've pulled off at all let alone so well.This long awaited first season set will thankfully contain not only the twelve first season episodes but a plethora of special featuers that take viewers behind the scenes. I wish the Sopranos had been granted season sets this elaborate, this set might rival the quality of the Breaking Bad season sets, which have themselves always been packed with extras.The Twelve Episodes Included (Just out of interest):Boardwalk EmpireThe Ivory TowerBroadway LimitedAnastasiaNights In BallygranFamily LimitationHomeHold Me in ParadiseBelle FemmeThe Emerald CityParis GreenA Return to NormalcyAn excellently crafted slow burn season that establishes this world and takes some interesting twists, turns and sudden plot developments but only once they've been earned. I don't want to give anything away to those who haven't seen it adn those who have seen it know how well constructed it is.Special Features:Exclusive to Blu-ray, Enhanced Viewing: fans will be able to enjoy a picture in picture experience on each episode that delves into the production process with cast and crew and also into the Atlantic City history the show is based on with Historians. (This sounds incredible).Making Boardwalk Empire: A standard behind-the-scenes look at the making of the series with cast and crew.Character Dossier: An evolving comprehensive character guide allows viewers to follow development of major players.Creating the Boardwalk: Explores how they designed and built the massive 300 foot boardwalk.Atlantic City: The Original Sin City - A 30 minute documentary that explores the roaring 20's in Atlantic City. (Nice to see them also focusing on providing historical material for a series such as this).Speakeasy Tour: Cast members from the series provide an insider's tour of famed prohibition era speakeasies in Chicago and New York.Audio Commentaries: Six will be provided featuring different combinations of actors Steve Buscemi, Michael Kenneth Williams and Michael Shannon. Creator/writer/executive producer Terence Winter, Director/Writer/Executive Producer Tim Van Patten, Writer?Supervising Producer Howard Korder and directors Brian Kirk and Allen Coulter.This is quite the comprehensive set that should please any fan of the series and might interest some historians.

I like Buscemi, but let's face it, he's a fairly one dimensional actor as he's been recreating Mr. Pink since Reservoir Dogs. I just don't buy this skinny, chain-smoking twerp being a powerful crime boss with his choice of all the best looking women.I've continued to watch but I nearly gave up after the first 2-3 episodes as it appeared to be just another period-piece fashion show full of unattractive characters. Another reason I nearly gave up on the show was the music. OK, we get it, it's 1920. Good God, back off. It is a very cheap & annoying method of conveying the time period of any movie to simply play period music underneath scene after scene, music that has no connection to what's on screen. In 1920, there were no radios or radios stations. And Victrolas were not exactly common. So why does there always seem to be an Al Jolson song playing from the next room in every scene?And the smoking! Buscemi would fall flat if he didn't have his cigarette smoking to fall back on as a prop. He obviously went to the Michael Madsen &#34;cigarette-smoking-as-acting&#34; school. Add the ever-present whiskey glass and you have cheap, tiresome &#34;acting&#34; tools for everyone to use in scene after scene. It's boring. And all the clever stories told by these gangsters every time they have to make a point? Most of these criminals of the time were uneducated cretins who could hardly put a sentence together let alone a wordy story full of colorful meatphors and the ultimate clever point. These were sociopaths and psychopaths, not Walt Whitman or Hawthorne.What ultimately made The Sopranos so special was the lead character, Tony Soprano. It sounds odd, but Tony Soprano is a psychopath I find funny and likable along with his murderous tendencies. As the lead character in Boardwalk Empire, Nucky Thompson exhibits very little that is likable. As TV psychopaths go, he is simply a mean,  insufferable jerk playing dress-up while he smokes and drinks constantly.And the best actor in the entire series, Michael Shannon, is wasted, IMO, with this bizarre Van Alden character.  At some point, for me anyway, in any film or series, there must be a character to like or admire on some level.

While it gets the atmospherics very well with a good story and great acting, I was disappointed to learn that the historical figure it is based on - Nucky Johnson - in fact employed no violence with the exception of economic -  he drove his enemies out of business but didn't off them in the gruesome manner in the series.With that big caveat, it is a very fun viewing experience that can be played more than once with enjoyment.  What really makes it is the actors:  each projects a powerful, believable character that evolves through the season.  It is a cut above soap opera, however over the top it can be at times.  You really get a sense of what people and the country were like in the 20s.Nucky Thompson is a political machine boss and gangster during the Prohibition era.  He protects and consolidates his territory, falls in love (revealing hidden parts of himself, such as his childhood abuse), and struggles to evade the law, in which the Federal government begins its ""encroachments"" into corrupt state and local politics.  It is splashy, there is never a dull moment, and the viewer empathizes with him just enough to root for him, yet feel horrified.  His inner circle includes a dangerously disgruntled brother, his bitter old mentor, and his stupidly self-destructive ward just back from WWI.  They challenge him while depending on him.

1375803,A2TU3RO6244TZ2,B003Y5HWJU,Stargazer,"[2, 3]","When I fist saw a promo for Boardwalk Empire on Foxtel cable TV, I knew I had to await the arrival of the DVD on Amazon,as I didn't have the movie channel designated to showing it, in my package. It was obvious this would be something special. The total ""look"" of the series, the clean cut clear camera shots,the wonderful detailed backdrops, the lighting,and superb costuming are all the ingredients that made the BBC peerless with their period dramas. HBO series' are proving to be every bit as alluring,and entertaining. The Sopranos was testament to that.Now Director Martin Scorcese - the man who made so many unforgettable movies with DeNiro in the 70's, and many others after that - is back doing what he knows best, a study of American life,this time in the magical prohibition era.Steve Buscemi dominates Boardwalk Empire in Series 1, portraying the lead character Enoch ""Nucky"" Thompson who runs Atlantic city with a firm hand.Nucky is part gangster,part politician who overseers speakeasies, gambling,men's clubs and prostitution. He also takes care of the the battlers upon whose vote at election time he calls in to support the candidates of his choosing. Nothing happens without him knowing about it, and he is backed up by an odd collection of men. His own brother,Elias (Eli) - played by Shea Wigham -  is a surly character who has a high position in the police department,and keeps his brother informed with what is going on within the department - giving Nucky an inside edge on his competitors.Unfortunately, Eli is suffering from the chronic disease of jealousy, and this eats away at him, especially when he has to rely on Nucky to get him reelected as Eli doesn't have the leadership qualities,character,and charisma of his brother. This is the wound that festers throughout series 1 and will no doubt be dealt with at some level in Series 2.There are some outstanding performances in Boardwalk Empire that deserve being noted. Michael Pitt (always with the same hair cut regardless of the role he is playing) is Jimmy Darmody, a dangerous character who can change from being gentle,kind,vulnerable, to a vicious cruel mobster in the blink of eye. He has returned from WW1 an emotionally broken man, and his behaviour becomes more erratic as the story progresses.Michael Shannon plays Agent Nelson Van Alden,a taxation officer who crosses the line by thinking the wrath of God should be brought down on the heads of these people involved in speakeasies,flop houses,and prostitution. He believes he has been designated by God to see they are all punished. Despite being pulled into line more than once by his superiors,Van Alden is obsessed with the evil he sees and becomes fixated on Mrs Schroeder, a widow with two small children,who is befriended by Nucky Thompson and later becomes his mistress.Kelly Macdonald,a Glaswegian born actor, gives an excellent performance as Mrs Schroeder. Gretchen Mol shines as Gillian Darmody - Jimmy's mother and a woman who has been around enough powerful men in her life to know how they think.And finally, Paz de la Huerta who is outstanding as Lucy Danziger,a prostitute who loves the good life, which her man Nucky Thompson can easily provide. Her confusion at being replaced by Mrs Schroeder was superbly enacted by de la Huerta, as she tries to regain her former standing.Gangsters from Chicago and New York are eyeing off Atlantic city as being the next place for them to expand their own business interests. The young, fearless newcomers with names such as Capone,Luciano and Rothstein realise that Nucky runs Atlantic city and he is too smart for them to topple - yet. The next series promises some interesting confrontations. I look forward to it.",5,"The Rise of the Notorious Gangsters,Capone,Luciano and One Man's Mission to Destroy Them",1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,3716,"['When', 'fist', 'saw', 'promo', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'Foxtel', 'cable', 'TV', 'knew', 'had', 'await', 'arrival', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'movie', 'channel', 'designated', 'showing', 'package', 'was', 'obvious', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'special', 'total', 'look', 'series', 'clean', 'cut', 'clear', 'camera', 'shots', 'wonderful', 'detailed', 'backdrops', 'lighting', 'superb', 'costuming', 'are', 'ingredients', 'made', 'BBC', 'peerless', 'period', 'dramas', 'HBO', 'series', 'are', 'proving', 'be', 'bit', 'alluring', 'entertaining', 'Sopranos', 'was', 'testament', 'that.Now', 'Director', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'unforgettable', 'movies', 'DeNiro', '70', 'many', 'others', 'back', 'doing', 'what', 'best', 'study', 'American', 'life', 'time', 'magical', 'prohibition', 'era.Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'Series', '1', 'portraying', 'lead', 'character', 'Enoch', 'Nucky', 'Thompson', 'who', 'Atlantic', 'city', 'firm', 'hand.Nucky', 'part', 'gangster', 'part', 'politician', 'who', 'speakeasies', 'gambling', 'men', 'clubs', 'prostitution', 'also', 'care', 'battlers', 'vote', 'election', 'time', 'support', 'candidates', 'choosing', 'Nothing', 'knowing', 'backed', 'up', 'odd', 'collection', 'men', 'own', 'brother', 'Elias', 'Eli', 'played', 'Shea', 'Wigham', 'surly', 'character', 'who', 'high', 'position', 'police', 'department', 'brother', 'informed', 'what', 'going', 'department', 'giving', 'Nucky', 'inside', 'edge', 'competitors.Unfortunately', 'Eli', 'suffering', 'chronic', 'disease', 'jealousy', 'away', 'especially', 'when', 'rely', 'Nucky', 'get', 'reelected', 'Eli', ""n't"", 'have', 'leadership', 'qualities', 'character', 'charisma', 'brother', 'wound', 'festers', 'series', '1', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'dealt', 'level', 'Series', '2.There', 'are', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'deserve', 'being', 'noted', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'always', 'same', 'hair', 'cut', 'regardless', 'role', 'playing', 'Jimmy', 'Darmody', 'dangerous', 'character', 'who', 'can', 'change', 'being', 'gentle', 'kind', 'vulnerable', 'vicious', 'cruel', 'mobster', 'blink', 'eye', 'returned', 'WW1', 'emotionally', 'broken', 'man', 'behaviour', 'more', 'erratic', 'story', 'progresses.Michael', 'Shannon', 'Agent', 'Nelson', 'Van', 'Alden', 'taxation', 'officer', 'who', 'line', 'thinking', 'wrath', 'God', 'should', 'be', 'brought', 'down', 'heads', 'people', 'involved', 'speakeasies', 'flop', 'houses', 'prostitution', 'been', 'designated', 'God', 'see', 'are', 'punished', 'being', 'pulled', 'line', 'more', 'once', 'superiors', 'Van', 'Alden', 'obsessed', 'evil', 'fixated', 'Mrs', 'Schroeder', 'widow', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'who', 'befriended', 'Nucky', 'Thompson', 'later', 'becomes', 'mistress.Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'Glaswegian', 'born', 'actor', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Mrs', 'Schroeder', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'shines', 'Gillian', 'Darmody', 'Jimmy', 'mother', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'enough', 'powerful', 'men', 'life', 'know', 'how', 'think.And', 'finally', 'Paz', 'de', 'la', 'Huerta', 'who', 'outstanding', 'Lucy', 'Danziger', 'prostitute', 'who', 'good', 'life', 'man', 'Nucky', 'Thompson', 'can', 'easily', 'provide', 'confusion', 'being', 'replaced', 'Mrs', 'Schroeder', 'was', 'superbly', 'enacted', 'la', 'Huerta', 'regain', 'former', 'standing.Gangsters', 'Chicago', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'eyeing', 'off', 'Atlantic', 'city', 'being', 'next', 'place', 'expand', 'own', 'business', 'interests', 'young', 'fearless', 'newcomers', 'names', 'such', 'Capone', 'Luciano', 'Rothstein', 'realise', 'Nucky', 'Atlantic', 'city', 'too', 'smart', 'topple', 'yet', 'next', 'series', 'interesting', 'confrontations', 'look', 'forward']",N/A

I thought Buscemi did a great job in the lead role and I didn't think he was at all over the top. I like period pieces, gangsters and crime but Season 1 failed to develop the characters and further the plot with some pretty interesting characters. We watched for hours waiting for something to happen and it rarely did. The show relies too much on the set, costumes and music of the 1920's and though it does a great job at that it does so by ignoring the action, plot development and use of character actors. Watching some of these actors sitting around in their apartments really did nothing but chew up some time. There were some interesting segments and cleverness but by the time you sit though all the dullness I really didn't care. I went with 3-stars because there's about one disc worth of good entertainment out of the five.",3,Not that my opinion counts with this many good reviews.,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,949,"['was', 'looking', 'HBO', 'series', 'would', 'force', 'buy', 'seasons', 'be', 'keeper', ""n't"", 'one', 'thought', 'Buscemi', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'lead', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'top', 'like', 'period', 'pieces', 'gangsters', 'crime', 'Season', '1', 'failed', 'develop', 'characters', 'further', 'plot', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'characters', 'watched', 'hours', 'waiting', 'something', 'happen', 'rarely', 'did', 'show', 'too', 'much', 'set', 'costumes', 'music', '1920', 'great', 'job', 'so', 'ignoring', 'action', 'plot', 'development', 'use', 'character', 'actors', 'Watching', 'actors', 'sitting', 'around', 'apartments', 'really', 'did', 'nothing', 'chew', 'up', 'time', 'were', 'interesting', 'segments', 'cleverness', 'time', 'sit', 'dullness', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'went', '3-stars', 'one', 'disc', 'worth', 'good', 'entertainment', 'five']",N/A
1375825,A2GOKFQGLRBXUB,B003Y5HWJU,TruAim,"[12, 21]","Most shows I either love or I hate, such as I loved ""Band of Brothers"" and I hated ""The Pacific.""  But season 1 of ""Boardwalk Empire"" is SUCH a mixed bag of the good, the bad and the ugly that I truly can't love it or hate it.  It's so middle of the road that all I can say is I think I sort of like it... a little bit... kind of.  There's no doubt the ""concept"" is a good one--a show about the lives of a disparate group of people whose lives are linked together by crime, politics and personal dramas in the ""Roaring 20s.""  It's a fascinating time that is ripe for the same HBO-ization storytelling that The Box did so well with in Rome, Deadwood and The Sopranos.  But make no mistake, Boardwalk is nowhere near a good as those three outstanding shows.  There are many problems, the first problem being the writing.  It's weak.  The writers created no great characters is Boardwalk, most of the characters are marginally interesting at best.  The main character,""Nucky"" Thompson, is the greedy, self-serving ""boss"" of Atlantic City.  He has no inner-conflict.  He just wants money, sex and power and that's it.  He has it at the start of the season and he has it at the end.  There's no character arc, no character growth, no great dramas or threats for him to contend with.  And thus, he's kind of one-note and boring.  Jimmy, his sort of young prot&eacute;g&eacute;, is a sullen WWI veteran looking to, I guess, make a name for himself or make big money.  Jimmy's desires and goals are never made clear regarding his ambitions or his intentions with his young wife and son.  He just sort of falls into a life of crime and you never really get to know him or grown to like him.  He's just this sullen, angry young man with no clear goals in life.  Margaret is the lead female in the show and she's also a seemingly ruddlerless character.  A seemingly good young Irish Catholic wife/mother/widow who, at the drop of a hat, becomes a ""kept woman"" (which seems way out of character for her on the show).  Besides weak characters, the dialog is also weak, with far too few attempts to use words, phrases and slang common in the 1920s.  Most of the characters talk just like people in the 2000s, so there's no sense of authenticity to the dialog and characters.  This lack of authenticity problem is also present in the set design.  Yes, the sets look beautiful, but maybe too beautiful, too clean, too perfect, because somehow the show's ""look"" comes off as too stage-y.  In Deadwood the sets looked real; here they look fake.  The acting is all over the place.  Buscemi (who I generally like) seems miscast in the lead role of Nucky; he lacks the presence, menace and power of his acting ""counterparts"" in The Sopranos and Deadwood.  Michael Pitt displays zero range as Jimmy, playing him boring and sullen throughout the entire season.  Kelly Macdonald lends authenticity to her character with her natural Irish accent and spot-on sense of good-girl properness, but the poor writing gives her nowhere to go with her character and she gets boring as the season drags on.  Michael K. Williams, who was SO awesome in ""The Wire,"" is absolutely horrible as Chalky White, the ""boss"" of the Negro community in A.C.  He makes zero effort to give his character any sense of being a Negro in the 1920s and completely comes off as a modern day African-American person in speech, mannerisms, body language.  His acting is by far the worst on the show.  Surprisingly, the best acting comes from a few of the supporting actors, like Paz de la Huerta, Jack Huston, Gretchen Mol, Emily Meade and Anatol Yusef.  Also the actor who plays Charlie Sheridan, the Irish Crime Boss of Northern Chicago, and the child actress (Lucy Gallina) who plays Margaret's daughter--both of them were outstanding. So overall I give the concept an A, the writing a D, the set designs and costumes a C, the acting a B- (though there are few minor A performances).  I'll also grade the opening credit sequence; I'll give it an F.  The concept, music, style and cinematography of this opening credit sequence are wretchedly bad.  But overall the actual show's not bad-bad, it's okay.  I'll watch season 2 and hope they crank up the drama (especially between the Feds and bootleggers), and give the characters (and actors) clearly defined purposes, goals and major conflicts to contend with.  So give it a shot, but just don't go in to it expecting Sopranos, Rome or Deadwood levels of greatness.",3,NOT AMONG HBO's BEST,1340841600,"06 28, 2012",2012,4458,"['Most', 'shows', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'such', 'loved', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'hated', 'Pacific', 'season', '1', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'mixed', 'bag', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'truly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'love', 'hate', 'so', 'middle', 'road', 'can', 'say', 'think', 'sort', 'little', 'bit', 'kind', 'doubt', 'concept', 'good', 'one', 'show', 'lives', 'disparate', 'group', 'people', 'lives', 'are', 'linked', 'together', 'crime', 'politics', 'personal', 'dramas', 'Roaring', '20s', 'fascinating', 'time', 'ripe', 'same', 'HBO-ization', 'storytelling', 'Box', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'Rome', 'Deadwood', 'Sopranos', 'make', 'mistake', 'Boardwalk', 'nowhere', 'good', 'three', 'outstanding', 'shows', 'are', 'many', 'problems', 'first', 'problem', 'being', 'writing', 'weak', 'writers', 'created', 'great', 'characters', 'Boardwalk', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'marginally', 'interesting', 'best', 'main', 'character', 'Nucky', 'Thompson', 'greedy', 'self-serving', 'boss', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'inner-conflict', 'just', 'money', 'sex', 'power', 'start', 'season', 'end', 'character', 'arc', 'character', 'growth', 'great', 'dramas', 'threats', 'contend', 'thus', 'kind', 'one-note', 'boring', 'Jimmy', 'sort', 'young', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'sullen', 'WWI', 'veteran', 'looking', 'guess', 'make', 'name', 'make', 'big', 'money', 'Jimmy', 'desires', 'goals', 'are', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'regarding', 'ambitions', 'intentions', 'young', 'wife', 'son', 'just', 'sort', 'falls', 'life', 'crime', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'grown', 'like', 'just', 'sullen', 'angry', 'young', 'man', 'clear', 'goals', 'life', 'Margaret', 'lead', 'female', 'show', 'also', 'seemingly', 'ruddlerless', 'character', 'seemingly', 'good', 'young', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'wife/mother/widow', 'who', 'drop', 'hat', 'kept', 'woman', 'way', 'character', 'show', 'weak', 'characters', 'dialog', 'also', 'weak', 'far', 'too', 'few', 'attempts', 'use', 'words', 'phrases', 'slang', 'common', '1920s', 'Most', 'characters', 'talk', 'just', 'like', 'people', '2000s', 'sense', 'authenticity', 'dialog', 'characters', 'lack', 'authenticity', 'problem', 'also', 'present', 'set', 'design', 'Yes', 'sets', 'look', 'beautiful', 'maybe', 'too', 'beautiful', 'too', 'clean', 'too', 'perfect', 'show', 'look', 'off', 'too', 'stage-y', 'Deadwood', 'sets', 'looked', 'real', 'here', 'look', 'fake', 'acting', 'place', 'Buscemi', 'who', 'generally', 'like', 'miscast', 'lead', 'role', 'Nucky', 'presence', 'menace', 'power', 'acting', 'counterparts', 'Sopranos', 'Deadwood', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'displays', 'zero', 'range', 'Jimmy', 'playing', 'boring', 'sullen', 'entire', 'season', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'authenticity', 'character', 'natural', 'Irish', 'accent', 'spot-on', 'sense', 'good-girl', 'properness', 'poor', 'writing', 'nowhere', 'go', 'character', 'boring', 'season', 'drags', 'Michael', 'K.', 'Williams', 'who', 'was', 'SO', 'awesome', 'Wire', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'Chalky', 'White', 'boss', 'Negro', 'community', 'A.C', 'zero', 'effort', 'give', 'character', 'sense', 'being', 'Negro', '1920s', 'completely', 'off', 'modern', 'day', 'African-American', 'person', 'speech', 'mannerisms', 'body', 'language', 'acting', 'far', 'worst', 'show', 'Surprisingly', 'best', 'acting', 'few', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Paz', 'de', 'la', 'Huerta', 'Jack', 'Huston', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'Emily', 'Meade', 'Anatol', 'Yusef', 'Also', 'actor', 'who', 'Charlie', 'Sheridan', 'Irish', 'Crime', 'Boss', 'Northern', 'Chicago', 'child', 'actress', 'Lucy', 'Gallina', 'who', 'Margaret', 'daughter', 'were', 'outstanding', 'overall', 'give', 'concept', 'A', 'writing', 'D', 'set', 'designs', 'C', 'acting', 'B-', 'are', 'few', 'minor', 'A', 'performances', ""'ll"", 'also', 'grade', 'opening', 'credit', 'sequence', ""'ll"", 'give', 'F.', 'concept', 'music', 'style', 'cinematography', 'opening', 'credit', 'sequence', 'are', 'wretchedly', 'bad', 'overall', 'actual', 'show', 'not', 'bad-bad', 'okay', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'season', '2', 'hope', 'crank', 'up', 'drama', 'especially', 'Feds', 'bootleggers', 'give', 'characters', 'actors', 'clearly', 'defined', 'purposes', 'goals', 'major', 'conflicts', 'contend', 'So', 'give', 'shot', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'Sopranos', 'Rome', 'Deadwood', 'levels', 'greatness']",N/A
