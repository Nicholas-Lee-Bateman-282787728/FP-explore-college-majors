A classic involving a staunch Alabama defense accompanied by a pounding ground game only added to the anticipation of returning to college footballs national title lore.  This was the Crimson Tides 13th National Title.  It was both needed and much desired.,5,Another collectable for any Bama fan.,1401321600,"05 29, 2014",2014,305,"['excellent', 'edition', 'Bama', 'football', 'fan', 'classic', 'involving', 'staunch', 'Alabama', 'defense', 'accompanied', 'pounding', 'ground', 'game', 'only', 'added', 'anticipation', 'returning', 'college', 'footballs', 'national', 'title', 'lore', 'was', 'Crimson', 'Tides', '13th', 'National', 'Title', 'was', 'needed', 'much', 'desired']",N/A

This game was fun from the word go, and as the first National Championship for Bama in 19 years, a treasured event for Bama fans. I wish Colt McCoy hadn't gotten hurt early, because there were a lot of sour grapes from some Texas fans and a few others about that. However, he got hurt because he goofed up a play and froze ... it's all part of the game. His replacement did an excellent job in the 3rd quarter and made the game uncomfortably interesting for a while.It was the culmination of a well coached season and a fitting end for a talented group of players who bought into Saban's coaching style and philosophy. Mark Ingram and Trent Richardson made up a running duo the like of which don't come along very often on one team, and they were as much fun to watch in this game as they had been all year long.When Texas took the early lead, it was a tense time for Bama fans. By the time the Texas shuffle pass resulted in a Bama TD to end the first half, I felt that the game was over. With long runs, long passes for both sides, and some great defense by Bama when they needed it most, the game was probably more entertaining than the average NC game for non-affiliated fans as well.Congratulations to Texas for a fine season too. They were a worthy opponent and had a host of talented young men on that team.I will warn that I docked two stars for the picture quality. The contrast on this picture is ridiculously low ... you may actually have to adjust your TV settings to be able to fully enjoy it. The sharpness of the image reminds you of something recorded on an overused VHS tape.Still, recommended for collectors of NC game films, and Bama fans in particular.",3,Fun look back for a Bama fan,1312848000,"08 9, 2011",2011,1754,"['Not', 'excellent', 'master', 'game', 'video', 'not', 'really', 'important', 'game', 'was', 'fun', 'word', 'go', 'first', 'National', 'Championship', 'Bama', '19', 'years', 'treasured', 'event', 'Bama', 'fans', 'wish', 'Colt', 'McCoy', 'had', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'hurt', 'early', 'were', 'lot', 'sour', 'grapes', 'Texas', 'fans', 'few', 'others', 'However', 'got', 'hurt', 'goofed', 'up', 'play', 'froze', 'part', 'game', 'replacement', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', '3rd', 'quarter', 'made', 'game', 'uncomfortably', 'interesting', 'while.It', 'was', 'culmination', 'well', 'coached', 'season', 'fitting', 'end', 'talented', 'group', 'players', 'who', 'bought', 'Saban', 'coaching', 'style', 'philosophy', 'Mark', 'Ingram', 'Trent', 'Richardson', 'made', 'up', 'running', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'along', 'very', 'often', 'one', 'team', 'were', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'game', 'had', 'been', 'year', 'long.When', 'Texas', 'took', 'early', 'lead', 'was', 'tense', 'time', 'Bama', 'fans', 'time', 'Texas', 'shuffle', 'pass', 'resulted', 'Bama', 'TD', 'end', 'first', 'half', 'felt', 'game', 'was', 'over', 'long', 'runs', 'long', 'passes', 'sides', 'great', 'defense', 'Bama', 'when', 'needed', 'most', 'game', 'was', 'probably', 'more', 'entertaining', 'average', 'NC', 'game', 'non-affiliated', 'fans', 'well.Congratulations', 'Texas', 'fine', 'season', 'too', 'were', 'worthy', 'opponent', 'had', 'host', 'talented', 'young', 'men', 'team.I', 'will', 'warn', 'docked', 'two', 'stars', 'picture', 'quality', 'contrast', 'picture', 'ridiculously', 'low', 'may', 'actually', 'have', 'adjust', 'TV', 'settings', 'be', 'able', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'sharpness', 'image', 'something', 'recorded', 'overused', 'VHS', 'tape.Still', 'recommended', 'collectors', 'NC', 'game', 'films', 'Bama', 'fans', 'particular']",N/A

Otherwise it's excellent: very professional editing by the ESPN producers plus bonus features--the championship celebration after the game, the awarding of the Heisman Trophy to Alabama's Mark Ingram, and a feature called Shortcuts, which are highlight plays in the order in which they occurred during the game.
