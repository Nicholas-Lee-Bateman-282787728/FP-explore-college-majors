They all seemed so normal clipping coupons, the kids going to school, the family always doing stuff together close to home. Now since they are famous they are always going on huge expensive trips, buying a super expensive home, and they rarely spend ""family time"" together anymore. It is more like there is a storyline in the newer episodes. It is okay that they have finished their show, they are not the same anymore and I lost interest.",2,Not the same family,1238976000,"04 6, 2009",2009,534,"['absolutely', 'agree', 'show', 'used', 'love', 'watching', 'everday', 'normal', 'life', 'seemed', 'so', 'normal', 'clipping', 'coupons', 'kids', 'going', 'school', 'family', 'always', 'doing', 'stuff', 'together', 'close', 'home', 'Now', 'are', 'famous', 'are', 'always', 'going', 'huge', 'expensive', 'trips', 'buying', 'super', 'expensive', 'home', 'rarely', 'spend', 'family', 'time', 'together', 'anymore', 'more', 'storyline', 'newer', 'episodes', 'okay', 'have', 'finished', 'show', 'are', 'not', 'same', 'anymore', 'lost', 'interest']","Jon and Kate Plus Ei8ht: Season 4, Volume One- The Wedding"

Notwithstanding the fact that Jon and Kate are having affairs and won't break up because of the cash cow that the show has become (it should be called Pimp my Sextuplets), this season is one big commercial. No normal family gets to do the quantity of trips and outings they do. I don't begrudge them these things but the show is supposed to be about a normal family, not some made for TV Monkee-esque family that deals with fame- not at least when they are crying ""poor us"" to churches and accepting love offerings and $20/pic of their kids.

Here are the episodes on this set, they collect the first half and include the multi-episode family trip to Hawaii for Jon & Kate's 'Second' Wedding.1 Boys Day Out2 Girls Day Out3 Sextuplets' 4th Birthday4 Korean Dinner5 Sunny Day6 All Aboard7 Heading South8 Wild Horses9 Beach Trip10 July 4th Celebrations11 Kate's Labor Day12 Backyard Campout13 Sight and Sound14 Picture Perfect15 Mr. Mom16 Back to School17 Baseball Game with Daddy18 Hawaii Here We Come18 Legos & Safaris20 Leis & Luaus21 For Better or WorseFor those who love the series these episodes only make it easier to love the Gosselin family. For those who were casual watcher's or who already found issue with the show or family these episodes give that much more reason to further dislike them. I personally enjoyed it when they were in their home living what seemed to be a normal life and came to think of them as a normal family. Here I found the series less interesting as you can see the fame they acquired through the show actually affecting their lifestyles and not just granting their children simple rights but granting them a new lifestyle where they can vacation seemingly on end and afford major trips to Hawaii. Like I said I'm not hating, just personally losing interest as I see the family I knew fading away, but for those who love this show and this family these episodes are a definite five stars. Though personally I can only give them three. Thanks.May 27th, 2009 ***After the fifth season premiere and Jon & Kate's recent marital troubles the whole idea of renewing their vows in Hawaii seems redundant or contradicted a bit now. A lot of people seem to be hating on this couple, but while I agree they lost focus of what was and still should be important I do hope that they can get back on track and figure things out, possibly put a rest to this show and go back to enjoying their lives and what truly matters in them. I wish they'd at least stop the show for a while to clean up the mess their lives are becoming. It's sad to see this happen to a couple that started out with all their priorities straight and only a few personality quirks that each of us can really be guilty of.",5,Hopefully Helpful Information,1237248000,"03 17, 2009",2009,2256,"['set', 'widescreen', 'episodes', '3', 'DVD', 'set', 'collecting', 'Part', 'season', 'four', 'Here', 'are', 'episodes', 'set', 'collect', 'first', 'half', 'include', 'multi-episode', 'family', 'trip', 'Hawaii', 'Jon', 'Kate', ""'Second"", 'Wedding.1', 'Boys', 'Day', 'Out2', 'Girls', 'Day', 'Out3', 'Sextuplets', '4th', 'Birthday4', 'Korean', 'Dinner5', 'Sunny', 'Day6', 'All', 'Aboard7', 'Heading', 'South8', 'Wild', 'Horses9', 'Beach', 'Trip10', 'July', '4th', 'Celebrations11', 'Kate', 'Labor', 'Day12', 'Backyard', 'Campout13', 'Sight', 'Sound14', 'Picture', 'Perfect15', 'Mr.', 'Mom16', 'Back', 'School17', 'Baseball', 'Game', 'Daddy18', 'Hawaii', 'Here', 'Come18', 'Legos', 'Safaris20', 'Leis', 'Luaus21', 'Better', 'WorseFor', 'who', 'love', 'series', 'only', 'make', 'easier', 'love', 'Gosselin', 'family', 'who', 'were', 'casual', 'watcher', 'who', 'already', 'found', 'issue', 'show', 'family', 'episodes', 'give', 'much', 'more', 'reason', 'further', 'dislike', 'personally', 'enjoyed', 'when', 'were', 'home', 'living', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'normal', 'life', 'came', 'think', 'normal', 'family', 'Here', 'found', 'series', 'less', 'interesting', 'can', 'see', 'fame', 'acquired', 'show', 'actually', 'affecting', 'lifestyles', 'not', 'just', 'granting', 'children', 'simple', 'rights', 'granting', 'new', 'lifestyle', 'where', 'can', 'vacation', 'seemingly', 'end', 'afford', 'major', 'trips', 'Hawaii', 'said', ""'m"", 'not', 'hating', 'just', 'personally', 'losing', 'interest', 'see', 'family', 'knew', 'fading', 'away', 'who', 'love', 'show', 'family', 'episodes', 'are', 'definite', 'five', 'stars', 'personally', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'three', 'Thanks.May', '27th', '2009', '***After', 'fifth', 'season', 'premiere', 'Jon', 'Kate', 'recent', 'marital', 'whole', 'idea', 'renewing', 'vows', 'Hawaii', 'redundant', 'contradicted', 'bit', 'now', 'lot', 'people', 'seem', 'be', 'hating', 'couple', 'agree', 'lost', 'focus', 'what', 'was', 'still', 'should', 'be', 'important', 'do', 'hope', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'possibly', 'put', 'rest', 'show', 'go', 'back', 'enjoying', 'lives', 'what', 'truly', 'matters', 'wish', ""'d"", 'least', 'stop', 'show', 'while', 'clean', 'up', 'mess', 'lives', 'are', 'becoming', 'sad', 'see', 'happen', 'couple', 'started', 'out', 'priorities', 'straight', 'only', 'few', 'personality', 'quirks', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'guilty']","Jon and Kate Plus Ei8ht: Season 4, Volume One- The Wedding"
