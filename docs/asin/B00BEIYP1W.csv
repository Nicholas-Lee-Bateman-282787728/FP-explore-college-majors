I thought it was really good but could have been a little bit better. the basic formula was  racing and life. it was a bit heavy on the life side. I would have liked to see more racing myself.as far as racing movies go , I can think of 6 I like. this won would rank 3rd among them. they are &#34;3&#34;, &#34;dale&#34;, &#34;days of thunder&#34;, &#34;rush&#34;, &#34;cannonball run&#34;, and &#34;death race 2000&#34;. now, 3 of those are real and 2 not. I like &#34;rush&#34; better than the real ones but less than the pretend ones.do NOT  mistake this movie with the 1992 movie, &#34;rush&#34; about heroin. that one wasn't any good but the racecar one is great.it was, in my opinion, on of but not the best movie of 2013.so, I say, if you are into racing of any kind, you should check out this movie. I could even see a couple watching this together. there is actually enough love to keep the women interested too. this is an all around good movie. the only ones I think who may not benefit from this are children.",4,the best real racing movies yet.,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,1082,"['im', 'race', 'fan', 'jumped', 'opportunity', 'see', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'basic', 'formula', 'was', 'racing', 'life', 'was', 'bit', 'heavy', 'life', 'side', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'racing', 'myself.as', 'far', 'racing', 'movies', 'go', 'can', 'think', '6', 'like', 'won', 'would', 'rank', '3rd', 'are', '34', '3', '34', '34', 'dale', '34', '34', 'days', 'thunder', '34', '34', 'rush', '34', '34', 'cannonball', 'run', '34', '34', 'death', 'race', '2000', '34', 'now', '3', 'are', 'real', '2', 'not', 'like', '34', 'rush', '34', 'better', 'real', 'ones', 'less', 'pretend', 'ones.do', 'NOT', 'mistake', 'movie', '1992', 'movie', '34', 'rush', '34', 'heroin', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'racecar', 'one', 'great.it', 'was', 'opinion', 'not', 'best', 'movie', '2013.so', 'say', 'are', 'racing', 'kind', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'movie', 'could', 'even', 'see', 'couple', 'watching', 'together', 'actually', 'enough', 'love', 'keep', 'women', 'interested', 'too', 'all', 'around', 'good', 'movie', 'only', 'ones', 'think', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'benefit', 'are', 'children']",Rush

1631671,A17DE61L1M0IG1,B00BEIYP1W,Alex418,"[1, 1]","If you asked me about formula one racing before seeing this movie, I could tell you that's it's racing cars and that it's popular in other countries and definitely not in the United States. I had never heard of James Hunt or Nikki Lauda in my life, and that probably contributed to my enjoyment of the film. This is an incredibly well-made movie about the rivalry between these two men.One of the reason why Rush is so great is that neither Hunt nor Lauda was really the antagonist. Hunt is more focused on partying and living the celebrity life, taking a lot of risks during the racing and hoping for the best. Lauda is more reserved and serious, calculating every move he makes. Both are likeable at times and complete douchebags at others, but by the end I liked them both and it was cool to see that they learned something from each other. These two actors both did a great job in their roles, as did all of the supporting cast.The story is punctuated by thrilling and harrowing racing scenes. Apparently, there is a 20% chance that any of these Formula One racers could die, and that makes many moments quite scary. The director also uses montages to keep the story moving briskly, and I was never remotely bored throughout, despite expecting Rush to feel draggy.I haven't heard much about this movie, but it deserves much more attention than it gets. It's extremely well-made and one of the best movies of 2013.

1631672,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00BEIYP1W,Alfred Johnson,"[5, 8]","Humankind had seemingly spent its eons of existence trying to move from Point A to Point B faster since it first came out of the slime and hit the land running. Naturally if we are hard-wired to seek to go from Point A to Point B faster, be it via goat-cart of sleek spaceship some guys, and lately some gals too,  want to be the fastest kid on the block, and get recognition for being Number One. The Ron Howard film under review, Rush, takes a modern day look at one such competitive flash in the world of top-shelf auto-racing.Here Howard takes a look at the famous 1970s duel between Austrian Nikki Lauda and Englishman James Hunt (famous in auto-racing circles because I, frankly, was totally unaware of this competition). Both men in their respective ways were errant sons but both were desperate to be Number One in their chosen field, Formula One auto-racing. Number One at being the fastest kid on the block. Number One too in staring death in the face in a ""human bomb"" as one of them described it.Now to be honest I get a little nervous, and not just cop nervous, going eighty miles an hour in a very serviceable tank (a tank compared to the high-tech machines they raced in). I also admit to having no interest at all in auto-racing at this level, although as a teenager I rode ""shot-gun"" a few times on ""chicken runs"" down at the far end of old Hullsville Beach (Massachusetts) when the king of the hill in that locale and my friend ""Stew-ball Stu"" Larkin took on all- comer and took all the girls back in the day, he 1960s day (that was why I was riding shot-gun, to get Stu's ""rejects"" not to stare death in the face, hell no). But that was maybe at ninety miles an hour, tops. However this film grabbed me and grabbed my companion too who gets nervous when she goes over sixty.In the end the reason that it grabbed me (us) was the pure desire of both men to win at whatever cost, win to define who they were in this wicked old world, and to stare death in the face and not flinch, not flinch at all. To go the edge and back. They both had very different styles, Lauda the technician, the guy who has every angle figured out from design to the curves and Hunt, well, Hunt a throw-back playboy who just wanted a drive, wanted to drive something fast even if it is a go-cart, drive it desperately, drive it like there was no tomorrow. I would assume most audiences would cheer for Brother Hunt (especially women with his Brad Pitts good looks) but would not be unhappy to see Nikki cross the checkered flag first either for other reasons.

I was kind of up in the air as to whether I really cared to watch it or not.  I guess I couldn't figure out from the hype whether it was worth 2 hours.  And then this week, after staring at it for the 3,567th time on my table, I just said, to heck with it, and popped it in the bluray player, and immersed myself it what has to be one of the all time great sports films, and one just fantastic film in its own right.First, the story is basically true, with some, but truly limited, license taken with the facts.  Hemsworth and Bruhle (did I spell that right?) are fantastic as two real life rivals James Hunt, and Niki Lauda... tremendous acting.  The racing scenes are outright spectacular...edge of your seat stuff.  I should have known it was going to be good as Ron Howard helmed this one, and he's made some great films.  Hans Zimmer's original score is pretty amazing too.In the end Rush is about what it actually takes to be the best, and explores mans' will to win, at all costs.  I can't help but think that I have lived my life more like James Hunt, but I secretly rue that I did not live it more like Niki Lauda.  If you watch Rush, which I wholly recommend you do, I'd be interested to see if anyone out there agrees with me.  Sometimes it's all about doubling down on yourself, even if no one else will.

It is hard to make a biopic about two people but Ron Howard adds his dramatic flair and makes a film that focuses the mens relentless pursuit for the F1 world championship in 1976. While the two men did admire each other they were in real life complete opposites. This is what makes the Rush so watchable because Howard is able to add his knack for directing drama in to film about cars.In my opinion the play of opposites worked a lot in making this film an enjoyable experience. Chris Hemsworth is James Hunt, loud, passionate and a risk taker who likes to party hard. Lauda is his opposite meticulous, fastidios and calculating the degree of dying to a percentage in a race ( He refused to race if the percentage was over 20).The film begins in the 70 and thus Howards compresses 6 years of action in a 123 minute long film.The movie focuses on the rivalry and the respect they had for each other and does have a few affecting moments such as the near death escape for Lauda in Berlin, and thus becomes the movies clear moral  winner but it is a scene at the end when the two men exchange their philosophies on life, we find a new respect for Hunt.

1631681,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B00BEIYP1W,Anthony L.,"[7, 9]","Those were director Ron Howard's words as he described the setting of his new film, RUSH - a fast-paced, colorful, energetic, adrenaline-filled, and excellently acted racing drama that some critics are are saying has ""the greatest car racing scenes ever shot on film"".Prepare to be surprised atChris Hemsworth's toughest and most meaty role yet - that of womanizing, fast-driving, fast-living British racer James Hunt. Hemsworth gives an entertaining and emotional performance, showing his range heretofore limited to smashing things with a hammer (which is still totally cool...). Accomplished young actorDaniel Bruhlsteals the scenes as the calculating, analytical, brilliant driver and Hunt's personal rival, Niki Lauda. Olivia Wilde and Natalie Dormer give quality performances, and like most of Ron Howard's resume, the film is excellently cast.The big focus here, though, is on the all-encompassing, deadly rivalry between Hunt and Lauda, which played itself out on race tracks all over the world. And guess what? The critics were right. In my opinion, it's *inarguable* that RUSH has some of the FINEST racing scenes ever shot. Filled with gut-clenching action and edgy cinematography, these set pieces are engrossing and fast-paced, and shot with a brilliant technical eye. Hans Zimmer's typically awesome score helps some, too. With clever camera tricks and brilliant editing, the audience is put right in the centre of the action - right in the cockpit of Hunt's Formula One race car. The noise is visceral and pulse-pounding, the driving is nail-bitingly tense, and the crashes are spectacular and terrifying. For added realism, Howard and his team used real cars for the races.Technically brilliant, RUSH is period-accurate (prepare for awkward hairdo's) - capturing that frenetic fervour of the 70's that made Formula One racing so popular. RUSH's cinematography is Howard's best sinceApollo 13, and the camerawork is stylish and kinetic, but the film is not without drama. The rivalry between Hunt and Lauda is emotionally played out with surprisingly excellent acting.Cons? The plot isn't really as original as it might hope, and still succumbs to many common tropes of sports movies - the training montage, the television broadcast to keep us up to date, etc.But RUSH is a formula (pun intended) film running in top gear. Like a sports car, exterior is shiny and good to look at, though under the hood it is strong and well-oiled.

1631683,A1IE5VY0HF5ICM,B00BEIYP1W,Arthur Mortensen,"[2, 2]","""Rush"" is worth seeing, and that's different.  Fact is, racing movies are rarely worth seeing.  Soap opera plots, terrible race simulation, and an emphasis on catastrophe make most of them B-movie, bubble gum movies (some of which are funny and entertaining).  The only exception before 2013 that this writer can recall was 1965's ""Grand Prix,"" directed by John Frankenheimer.  It did have a soap opera plot, but it focused with remarkable effectiveness on a plausible Formula I campaign featuring an aging star's challenge by two much younger and bolder drivers, with much detailed observation of how motor sport teams work.  Made in the era before workstation graphics could simulate almost anything perfectly, the film featured extraordinary driving sequences, many of which were driven by the film's stars.Ron Howard's ""Rush"" is a better film, not so much for the very effective simulation of actual racing conditions (though it is excellent at that, often far better than ""Grand Prix"" ever could have been), but for an impressive, well-written, and well-played depiction of the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda in the 1978 Formula I campaign.  To effectuate the plot, Lauda is portrayed somewhat unfairly (Lauda, a three-time champion, was one of the greats, and is still active as a team manager).  But that's fine; this is fiction based on history, not biography.  As the fierce Lauda, Daniel Bruhl is marvelous, and manages to be an oddly sympathetic character despite a deadly competitiveness and technomaniac humorlessness that nearly get him killed at the 'Ring.  His courtship of Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara) is weirdly charming, their strong connection and loyalty a surprise in a sport as notorious as Hollywood is for casual infidelities.Chris Hemsworth was so right as James Hunt, a driver as vividly in the public eye in his day as Stirling Moss was in his, that I wondered if Hemsworth might be related.  Really the last of privately financed drivers (and of course Hunt didn't win his championship that way), he was a throwback to a pre-corporate sponsor era in Formula I racing, a sport considered as much romance as competition, and was fabulously deadly, killing one or two stars every year and injuring many more drivers horribly. It also often killed spectators, sometimes in large numbers.The story, unlike most racing films, embraces the complications of team, friendship, courtship, and competition in a sport that has its roots in chariot racing in classical times.  Howard manages to restrain the ""announcer over"" style that makes a mess of so many sports movies (they start to sound like NFL highlight films).  ""Rush"" is not at all like that. I enjoyed all of the characters, and have seen the movie twice.  The conflict between Lauda and Hunt, in the fabulous milieu of motor racing, which was real and widely reported in 1978, was a great choice, forcing the whole company to attach itself to real things instead of to the usual romantic fantasies about racing.However, to be honest, ""Rush"" is a film about a variety of Formula I racing that has entirely vanished.  For all this sport's reputation for deadliness, great former drivers like Jackie Stewart, Niki Lauda, and many others in the FIA, have over the past forty years recreated Formula I.  They've done this by making its tracks safe (there used to be trees lining the roadways, and spectators sat unprotected along the edges as well), vastly improving car safety, and finally excluding the ever-dangerous amateurs who used to share in the competition.  Despite those changes, the cars are far faster, and the crowds bigger by an order of magnitude. And yet, it has been twenty years since there has been a fatality in Formula I, a record far better than American football.  I'm not knocking Howard for making a film about another era, but one shouldn't take his incisive and wonderfully made movie as a depiction of where motor sport is today.  The romance of blood, the driver as matador, has faded thankfully into history.  Today, millions of people enjoy seeing their heroes drive faster than ever and live to race again next season.",4,"At Last, A Plausible Racing Movie!",1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,4139,"['Rush', 'worth', 'seeing', 'different', 'Fact', 'racing', 'movies', 'are', 'rarely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Soap', 'opera', 'plots', 'terrible', 'race', 'simulation', 'emphasis', 'catastrophe', 'make', 'most', 'B-movie', 'bubble', 'gum', 'movies', 'are', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'only', 'exception', '2013', 'writer', 'can', 'recall', 'was', '1965', 'Grand', 'Prix', 'directed', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'did', 'have', 'soap', 'opera', 'plot', 'focused', 'remarkable', 'effectiveness', 'plausible', 'Formula', 'campaign', 'featuring', 'aging', 'star', 'challenge', 'two', 'much', 'younger', 'bolder', 'drivers', 'much', 'detailed', 'observation', 'how', 'motor', 'sport', 'teams', 'work', 'Made', 'era', 'workstation', 'graphics', 'could', 'simulate', 'almost', 'anything', 'perfectly', 'film', 'featured', 'extraordinary', 'driving', 'sequences', 'many', 'were', 'driven', 'film', 'stars.Ron', 'Howard', 'Rush', 'better', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'very', 'effective', 'simulation', 'actual', 'racing', 'conditions', 'excellent', 'often', 'far', 'better', 'Grand', 'Prix', 'ever', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'impressive', 'well-written', 'well-played', 'depiction', 'rivalry', 'James', 'Hunt', 'Niki', 'Lauda', '1978', 'Formula', 'campaign', 'effectuate', 'plot', 'Lauda', 'portrayed', 'somewhat', 'unfairly', 'Lauda', 'three-time', 'champion', 'was', 'one', 'greats', 'still', 'active', 'team', 'manager', 'fine', 'fiction', 'based', 'history', 'not', 'biography', 'fierce', 'Lauda', 'Daniel', 'Bruhl', 'marvelous', 'be', 'oddly', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'deadly', 'competitiveness', 'technomaniac', 'humorlessness', 'nearly', 'get', 'killed', ""'Ring"", 'courtship', 'Marlene', 'Alexandra', 'Maria', 'Lara', 'weirdly', 'charming', 'strong', 'connection', 'loyalty', 'surprise', 'sport', 'as', 'notorious', 'Hollywood', 'casual', 'infidelities.Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'was', 'so', 'right', 'James', 'Hunt', 'driver', 'vividly', 'public', 'eye', 'day', 'Stirling', 'Moss', 'was', 'wondered', 'Hemsworth', 'might', 'be', 'related', 'Really', 'last', 'privately', 'financed', 'drivers', 'course', 'Hunt', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'championship', 'way', 'was', 'throwback', 'pre-corporate', 'sponsor', 'era', 'Formula', 'racing', 'sport', 'considered', 'much', 'romance', 'competition', 'was', 'fabulously', 'deadly', 'killing', 'one', 'two', 'stars', 'year', 'injuring', 'many', 'more', 'drivers', 'horribly', 'also', 'often', 'killed', 'spectators', 'sometimes', 'large', 'numbers.The', 'story', 'most', 'racing', 'films', 'complications', 'team', 'friendship', 'courtship', 'competition', 'sport', 'roots', 'chariot', 'racing', 'classical', 'times', 'Howard', 'restrain', 'announcer', 'style', 'mess', 'so', 'many', 'sports', 'movies', 'start', 'sound', 'NFL', 'highlight', 'films', 'Rush', 'not', 'enjoyed', 'characters', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'twice', 'conflict', 'Lauda', 'Hunt', 'fabulous', 'milieu', 'motor', 'racing', 'was', 'real', 'widely', 'reported', '1978', 'was', 'great', 'choice', 'forcing', 'whole', 'company', 'attach', 'real', 'things', 'instead', 'usual', 'romantic', 'fantasies', 'racing.However', 'be', 'honest', 'Rush', 'film', 'variety', 'Formula', 'racing', 'entirely', 'vanished', 'sport', 'reputation', 'deadliness', 'great', 'former', 'drivers', 'Jackie', 'Stewart', 'Niki', 'Lauda', 'many', 'others', 'FIA', 'have', 'past', 'forty', 'years', 'recreated', 'Formula', ""'ve"", 'done', 'making', 'tracks', 'safe', 'used', 'be', 'trees', 'lining', 'roadways', 'spectators', 'sat', 'unprotected', 'edges', 'well', 'vastly', 'improving', 'car', 'safety', 'finally', 'excluding', 'ever-dangerous', 'amateurs', 'who', 'used', 'share', 'competition', 'changes', 'cars', 'are', 'far', 'faster', 'crowds', 'bigger', 'order', 'magnitude', 'yet', 'been', 'twenty', 'years', 'been', 'fatality', 'Formula', 'record', 'far', 'better', 'American', 'football', ""'m"", 'not', 'knocking', 'Howard', 'making', 'film', 'era', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'take', 'incisive', 'wonderfully', 'made', 'movie', 'depiction', 'where', 'motor', 'sport', 'today', 'romance', 'blood', 'driver', 'matador', 'faded', 'thankfully', 'history', 'Today', 'millions', 'people', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'heroes', 'drive', 'faster', 'ever', 'live', 'race', 'again', 'next', 'season']",Rush

1631685,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B00BEIYP1W,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[2, 4]","1976. Two racing drivers are competing for the Formula One World Championship. Racing for Ferrari is Niki Lauda, a studious, restrained, methodical and logical driver. Racing for McLaren is James Hunt, a flamboyant British playboy who prefers partying to doing homework about downforce and aerodynamics. Their radically different styles of driving are put to the test in a season-long showdown that will leave one of them physically scarred for life.Rush is the movie dramatisation of the events of the 1976 Formula One championship season. This season is infamous for its nailbiting, year-long battle between Hunt and Lauda. The showdown is often cited as being the transformative moment for F1's popular appeal, turning it from a niche sport into a global phenomenon as a result of the sale of TV rights for the whole season, allowing motor sports fans across the world to see every race rather than odd highlights.It's also noted for another shocking event: at one of the races Lauda's Ferrari spun out and burst into flames. It took a minute for Lauda to be pulled from the car, during which he suffered burns to his entire body. He was rushed to hospital and was not expected to survive, even being given the Last Rites by a priest. Unbelievably, Lauda survived and recovered. Even more unbelievably, he was back in the racing seat just six weeks after the accident, determined to take the championship to the last race, which he did.If director Ron Howard had made up this story, people would be howling to the rafters about its contrived nature. However, the fact that it is true adds an air of authenticity to the drama which really helps sell the tension.As well as its story and tension, Rush also does very well with its actors. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl play Hunt and Lauda to perfection, with Bruhl in particular going to some lengths to nail Lauda's very precise and distinctive way of speaking, familiar to hundreds of millions of people around the world from almost forty years of working in F1 (as a driver and more recently as a team executive for Mercedes). Other actors tend to fade a little in less-prominent appearances, but Alexandra Maria Lara brings dignity to the role of Lauda's wife, Marlene, and Natalie Dormer has a small but memorable role as a nurse treating Hunt for a crash injury early on in the movie.Where the film falters is its treatment of the races. Millions of people watch F1 every year all around the world and faking the races with CGI was never going to work (you can tell straight away). Indeed, the few scenes where CGI is clearly used are distracting. At the same time, Howard was never going to get a budget large enough to accurately rebuild 20+ 1976 F1 racing cars and race them at the real circuits, where they have survived (in fact, the $38 million budget is rather small for such a film). The result is a compromise: several real cars are built and raced around, enhanced with CG where necessary, with the distracting use of full-CGI scenes and backgrounds kept to a minimum. This all works reasonably well, but it means that the actual racing is kept to a minimum, with the focus on the drama.This is where the film comes unstuck. Howard establishes early on that Hunt is the playboy who lives on the seat of his pants and loves partying and women, whilst Lauda is the serious technician who knows the engineering of F1 cars better than several of his dedicated engineers. And that's really it, neither of them change or evolve through the film. Hunts gets married because he thinks it's good for his image and this doesn't work out, which we could guess. Lauda is arrogant and opinionated and is sometimes proven wrong, teaching him occasional moments of humility which never seem to last. A frequent problem of adapting real events into stories is that real life is too disorganised and people too varied to fit into the boxes required by drama, and in this case there isn't enough meat to the story arcs to justify the amount of time that is spent on the non-racing segments.As a result, Rush (***) feels a little bit lightweight. The racing scenes, where they actually exist, are good. The battle on track and the off-track battle of wills between the two drivers is well-handled, driven by excellent performances. But there isn't enough actual character development to justify the amount of time spent on the non-racing segments, and there isn't enough money or practical ability to focus on the racing segments more successfully than they do here. It all ends up being fun, but with a sense of also being underwhelming compared to some of the actual documentaries covering the events.",3,"Fun, but less gripping than many documentaries on the same events",1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,4654,"['1976', 'Two', 'racing', 'drivers', 'are', 'competing', 'Formula', 'One', 'World', 'Championship', 'Racing', 'Ferrari', 'Niki', 'Lauda', 'studious', 'restrained', 'methodical', 'logical', 'driver', 'Racing', 'McLaren', 'James', 'Hunt', 'flamboyant', 'British', 'playboy', 'who', 'partying', 'doing', 'homework', 'downforce', 'aerodynamics', 'radically', 'different', 'styles', 'driving', 'are', 'put', 'test', 'season-long', 'showdown', 'will', 'leave', 'one', 'physically', 'scarred', 'life.Rush', 'movie', 'dramatisation', 'events', '1976', 'Formula', 'One', 'championship', 'season', 'season', 'infamous', 'nailbiting', 'year-long', 'battle', 'Hunt', 'Lauda', 'showdown', 'often', 'cited', 'being', 'transformative', 'moment', 'F1', 'popular', 'appeal', 'turning', 'niche', 'sport', 'global', 'phenomenon', 'result', 'sale', 'TV', 'rights', 'whole', 'season', 'allowing', 'motor', 'sports', 'fans', 'world', 'see', 'race', 'rather', 'odd', 'highlights.It', 'also', 'noted', 'shocking', 'event', 'one', 'races', 'Lauda', 'Ferrari', 'spun', 'out', 'burst', 'flames', 'took', 'minute', 'Lauda', 'be', 'pulled', 'car', 'suffered', 'burns', 'entire', 'body', 'was', 'rushed', 'hospital', 'was', 'not', 'expected', 'survive', 'even', 'being', 'given', 'Last', 'Rites', 'priest', 'Unbelievably', 'Lauda', 'survived', 'recovered', 'Even', 'more', 'unbelievably', 'was', 'back', 'racing', 'seat', 'just', 'six', 'weeks', 'accident', 'determined', 'take', 'championship', 'last', 'race', 'director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'had', 'made', 'up', 'story', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'howling', 'rafters', 'contrived', 'nature', 'However', 'fact', 'true', 'air', 'authenticity', 'drama', 'really', 'sell', 'tension.As', 'well', 'story', 'tension', 'Rush', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'actors', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Daniel', 'Bruhl', 'play', 'Hunt', 'Lauda', 'perfection', 'Bruhl', 'particular', 'going', 'lengths', 'nail', 'Lauda', 'very', 'precise', 'distinctive', 'way', 'speaking', 'familiar', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'people', 'world', 'almost', 'forty', 'years', 'working', 'F1', 'driver', 'more', 'recently', 'team', 'executive', 'Mercedes', 'Other', 'actors', 'tend', 'fade', 'little', 'less-prominent', 'appearances', 'Alexandra', 'Maria', 'Lara', 'dignity', 'role', 'Lauda', 'wife', 'Marlene', 'Natalie', 'Dormer', 'small', 'memorable', 'role', 'nurse', 'treating', 'Hunt', 'crash', 'injury', 'early', 'movie.Where', 'film', 'falters', 'treatment', 'races', 'Millions', 'people', 'watch', 'F1', 'year', 'all', 'world', 'faking', 'races', 'CGI', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'work', 'can', 'tell', 'straight', 'away', 'Indeed', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'CGI', 'clearly', 'used', 'are', 'distracting', 'same', 'time', 'Howard', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'get', 'budget', 'large', 'enough', 'accurately', 'rebuild', '20+', '1976', 'F1', 'racing', 'cars', 'race', 'real', 'circuits', 'where', 'have', 'survived', 'fact', '38', 'million', 'budget', 'rather', 'small', 'such', 'film', 'result', 'compromise', 'several', 'real', 'cars', 'are', 'built', 'raced', 'enhanced', 'CG', 'where', 'necessary', 'distracting', 'use', 'full-CGI', 'scenes', 'backgrounds', 'kept', 'minimum', 'reasonably', 'well', 'actual', 'racing', 'kept', 'minimum', 'focus', 'drama.This', 'where', 'film', 'unstuck', 'Howard', 'early', 'Hunt', 'playboy', 'who', 'seat', 'pants', 'loves', 'partying', 'women', 'whilst', 'Lauda', 'serious', 'technician', 'who', 'engineering', 'F1', 'cars', 'better', 'several', 'dedicated', 'engineers', 'really', 'change', 'evolve', 'film', 'Hunts', 'married', 'good', 'image', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'could', 'guess', 'Lauda', 'arrogant', 'opinionated', 'sometimes', 'proven', 'wrong', 'teaching', 'occasional', 'moments', 'humility', 'never', 'seem', 'last', 'frequent', 'problem', 'adapting', 'real', 'events', 'stories', 'real', 'life', 'too', 'disorganised', 'people', 'too', 'varied', 'fit', 'boxes', 'required', 'drama', 'case', ""n't"", 'enough', 'meat', 'story', 'arcs', 'justify', 'amount', 'time', 'spent', 'non-racing', 'segments.As', 'result', 'Rush', '***', 'little', 'bit', 'lightweight', 'racing', 'scenes', 'where', 'actually', 'exist', 'are', 'good', 'battle', 'track', 'off-track', 'battle', 'wills', 'two', 'drivers', 'well-handled', 'driven', 'excellent', 'performances', ""n't"", 'enough', 'actual', 'character', 'development', 'justify', 'amount', 'time', 'spent', 'non-racing', 'segments', ""n't"", 'enough', 'money', 'practical', 'ability', 'focus', 'racing', 'segments', 'more', 'successfully', 'do', 'here', 'up', 'being', 'fun', 'sense', 'also', 'being', 'underwhelming', 'compared', 'actual', 'documentaries', 'covering', 'events']",Rush

Yes ill say it, some of the best films in history. Just one look at his filmography would confirm it, the man has contributed a lot to the world of film for which I'm thankful. Last year was a rather slow year for him admittedly, but the one film that was released entered and left with a bang in theaters for all the right reasons. Rush is a great film, its about 1970's Formula One racing of all things, but the characters and the actors/actresses who portray them do such great jobs you are sucked into the drama and can't help but enjoy it. This is a fast paced, slick, action packed film. The cinematography is just great, with adrenaline pumping speed races and a story that is just full of drama, twists and turns, and excitement.The story is about the real life rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, two of the best speed racers of their time and ultimately form a bitter rivalry. Whats interesting about this film is seeing Chris Hemsworth (as Hunt) as a character other than a Norse God or a teen heartthrob. Don't get me wrong, his character is still a ladies man, but he does bring more to the table than just a pretty face in this story. Daniel Bruhl does a phenomenal job as well (as Lauda) in fact I believe he has a slightly better performance than Hemsworth, but since they both do so well its really just a win win. The real excitement of the film are the races themselves when these two get behind the wheel, especially the way they are filmed. Its exciting, its fast, its stylish, and its a lot of fun to see.This is one film you definitely need to check out. I really enjoyed it and I am not a fan of racing personally. I thought I would not enjoy it and I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed it.

My guess is, if you are familiar with the story, you are in the minority. So, Ron Howard's biographical film may have been a really great choice for a story to tell. Those in Europe may be acutely familiar with it but even they may not have heard the intricate details behind the scenes that made up one of the most bitter racing rivalries in history.The casting of the title characters was spot on and I only know this based on the real footage of the two personalities at the end of the film and the story that was told. James Hunt was a blonde-haired playboy with a lust for testing life, partying and women. So, ""Thor""'s Chris Hemsworth was a perfect fit for the part. Niki Lauda was a small perfectionist with an overbite and was played by German actor Daniel Bruhl. Combine two well cast actors with a juicy story, rivalry, fast moving cars and one of the best storytelling directors in Hollywood and ""Rush"" has all the right ingredients.First and foremost, ""Rush"" is not ""Days of Thunder"" or ""Fast and Furious"". I was more taken by the storyline and acting than I was the racing sequences. I found the racing sequences to be a little disappointing for the most part. They were few and far between and much of what made Niki Lauda and James Hunt despise each other so much was because of what happened between them on the race track. This was all portrayed, but much of what made ""Rush"" a good movie was as I stated before; Ron Howard, being a great storyteller.Not having the slightest idea of what happened between Hunt and Lauda, I found myself completely involved in their conflicted and conflicting personalities. The 1976 Formula One season was a life changer for both men and that is what the movie focuses on; one year, one season of their lives. I would only recommend that you go to see ""Rush"" for the story and the drama because if you're going to be dazzled by dynamic racing sequences, you'll be disappointed. To me, this was the weakest part of the film, but fortunately there was an amazing story to tell about the human spirit, the value of life and the risks that race car drivers take when they get behind the wheel for the sake of sport and fame.",4,LESS ABOUT THE CARS AND ALL ABOUT THE DRIVERS,1380499200,"09 30, 2013",2013,2315,"[""'re"", 'familiar', '70', 'era', 'Formula', 'One', 'rivalry', 'Niki', 'Lauda', 'James', 'Hunt', 'then', 'Rush', 'may', 'not', 'hold', 'too', 'many', 'surprises', 'guess', 'are', 'familiar', 'story', 'are', 'minority', 'So', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'biographical', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'great', 'choice', 'story', 'tell', 'Europe', 'may', 'be', 'acutely', 'familiar', 'even', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'heard', 'intricate', 'details', 'scenes', 'made', 'up', 'one', 'most', 'bitter', 'racing', 'rivalries', 'history.The', 'casting', 'title', 'characters', 'was', 'spot', 'only', 'know', 'based', 'real', 'footage', 'two', 'personalities', 'end', 'film', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'James', 'Hunt', 'was', 'blonde-haired', 'playboy', 'lust', 'testing', 'life', 'partying', 'women', 'So', 'Thor', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'was', 'perfect', 'fit', 'part', 'Niki', 'Lauda', 'was', 'small', 'perfectionist', 'overbite', 'was', 'played', 'German', 'actor', 'Daniel', 'Bruhl', 'Combine', 'two', 'well', 'cast', 'actors', 'juicy', 'story', 'rivalry', 'fast', 'moving', 'cars', 'one', 'best', 'storytelling', 'directors', 'Hollywood', 'Rush', 'right', 'ingredients.First', 'foremost', 'Rush', 'not', 'Days', 'Thunder', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'was', 'more', 'taken', 'storyline', 'acting', 'was', 'racing', 'sequences', 'found', 'racing', 'sequences', 'be', 'little', 'disappointing', 'most', 'part', 'were', 'few', 'far', 'much', 'what', 'made', 'Niki', 'Lauda', 'James', 'Hunt', 'despise', 'other', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'what', 'happened', 'race', 'track', 'was', 'portrayed', 'much', 'what', 'made', 'Rush', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'stated', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'being', 'great', 'storyteller.Not', 'having', 'slightest', 'idea', 'what', 'happened', 'Hunt', 'Lauda', 'found', 'completely', 'involved', 'conflicted', 'conflicting', 'personalities', '1976', 'Formula', 'One', 'season', 'was', 'life', 'changer', 'men', 'what', 'movie', 'one', 'year', 'one', 'season', 'lives', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'go', 'see', 'Rush', 'story', 'drama', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'dazzled', 'dynamic', 'racing', 'sequences', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'was', 'weakest', 'part', 'film', 'fortunately', 'was', 'amazing', 'story', 'tell', 'human', 'spirit', 'value', 'life', 'risks', 'race', 'car', 'drivers', 'take', 'when', 'get', 'wheel', 'sake', 'sport', 'fame']",Rush

1631718,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00BEIYP1W,C. Sawin,"[3, 7]","Most racing or car related films pale in comparison to the ""The Fast and the Furious"" franchise. While the series is improving with each installment, it's also a massive hit at the box office. Discovering a racing film that isn't an overflowing garbage heap seems like a victory in itself with this year's ""Getaway"" failing to shake that impression. While there isn't really a Formula One racing film to compare to Ron Howard's ""Rush"" (unless the Sylvester Stallone starring ""Driven"" from 2001 counts), the Nascar themed ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" came to mind with Jackie Chan's ""Thunderbolt"" coming in a close second. Remarkably enough, ""Rush"" shakes off whatever misconceptions you may have about the film going into it and may be one of 2013's most entertaining films.""Rush"" is based on the true story of the relentless rivalry between Formula One drivers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) between 1970 and 1976. You witness the two very different stories of how the two became pro race car drivers with Hunt slowly building his way up and earning the respect of others despite his reckless ways and Lauda doing everything himself, paying his way into the field, and quickly developing a reputation as an extremely headstrong loner.The most unexpected element of ""Rush"" is how genuine the relationship between James Hunt and Niki Lauda becomes. What begins as a rivalry slowly evolves into what feels like a friendship that is filled with mutual respect for one another. Even when they're trash talking one another, you can sense that everything they say and do to each other only loads another clip in the ammunition that represents their passion and desire to win.The first-class cinematography will easily ignite the adrenaline rush in you, as well. The camera always seems to be just in the right place at the right time to make you feel like you're sitting in the car along with these drivers feeling the roar of the engine and racing around death-defying turns; seeing the drivers shift gears, close-ups of screaming engines at the start of the race, the perspective of someone being right on the tail of the leader through their side mirror, and pistons pumping like there's no tomorrow only fuel your desire to see more. You even seem to have low-visibility just like the drivers when it's raining on the race track. These are some of the best racing sequences to be filmed in quite some time.Formula One drivers are as famous as rock stars in ""Rush."" There are always countless fans waiting for an autograph outside of public places, constant press, loads of money to be made, and an endless line of women waiting to sleep with a man who gets behind the wheel and drives in circles at 170 mph. Maybe being born 10-15 years after the fact factors into it, but it becomes a bit difficult to believe that drivers were basically porn stars that women lusted over and threw themselves at as if the drivers were members of The Beatles. While the film's early moments are intriguing, at its core the first 30 or so minutes are nothing more than a pissing contest between two stubborn men acting like children and it becomes a little tiresome until they reach the pro circuit. Then there's Olivia Wilde who proves once again that she's the queen of taking minor roles in bigger films that don't really go anywhere.""Rush"" will reel you in with its heart pounding and breathtaking racing sequences, but the biographical action film will win you over with its compassion. Absolutely exhilarating, amusing, and passionate to the very end, ""Rush"" is a film that has no right to be as good as it is.",4,This is what adrenaline feels like,1380240000,"09 27, 2013",2013,3642,"['Most', 'racing', 'car', 'related', 'films', 'pale', 'comparison', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'franchise', 'series', 'improving', 'installment', 'also', 'massive', 'hit', 'box', 'office', 'Discovering', 'racing', 'film', ""n't"", 'overflowing', 'garbage', 'heap', 'victory', 'year', 'Getaway', 'failing', 'shake', 'impression', ""n't"", 'really', 'Formula', 'One', 'racing', 'film', 'compare', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Rush', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'starring', 'Driven', '2001', 'counts', 'Nascar', 'themed', 'Talladega', 'Nights', 'Ballad', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'came', 'mind', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Thunderbolt', 'coming', 'close', 'second', 'Remarkably', 'enough', 'Rush', 'misconceptions', 'may', 'have', 'film', 'going', 'may', 'be', 'one', '2013', 'most', 'entertaining', 'films', 'Rush', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'relentless', 'rivalry', 'Formula', 'One', 'James', 'Hunt', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Niki', 'Lauda', 'Daniel', 'Bruhl', '1970', '1976', 'witness', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'stories', 'how', 'two', 'became', 'pro', 'race', 'car', 'drivers', 'Hunt', 'slowly', 'building', 'way', 'up', 'earning', 'respect', 'others', 'reckless', 'ways', 'Lauda', 'doing', 'everything', 'paying', 'way', 'field', 'quickly', 'developing', 'reputation', 'extremely', 'headstrong', 'loner.The', 'most', 'unexpected', 'element', 'Rush', 'how', 'genuine', 'relationship', 'James', 'Hunt', 'Niki', 'Lauda', 'What', 'rivalry', 'slowly', 'what', 'friendship', 'filled', 'mutual', 'respect', 'one', 'Even', 'when', ""'re"", 'trash', 'talking', 'one', 'can', 'sense', 'everything', 'say', 'do', 'other', 'only', 'clip', 'ammunition', 'passion', 'desire', 'win.The', 'first-class', 'cinematography', 'will', 'easily', 'ignite', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'as', 'well', 'camera', 'always', 'be', 'just', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'make', 'feel', ""'re"", 'sitting', 'car', 'drivers', 'feeling', 'roar', 'engine', 'racing', 'around', 'death-defying', 'turns', 'seeing', 'drivers', 'shift', 'gears', 'close-ups', 'screaming', 'engines', 'start', 'race', 'perspective', 'someone', 'being', 'right', 'tail', 'leader', 'side', 'mirror', 'pistons', 'pumping', 'tomorrow', 'only', 'fuel', 'desire', 'see', 'more', 'even', 'seem', 'have', 'low-visibility', 'just', 'drivers', 'when', 'raining', 'race', 'track', 'are', 'best', 'racing', 'sequences', 'be', 'filmed', 'quite', 'time.Formula', 'One', 'drivers', 'are', 'as', 'famous', 'rock', 'stars', 'Rush', 'are', 'always', 'countless', 'fans', 'waiting', 'autograph', 'outside', 'public', 'places', 'constant', 'press', 'loads', 'money', 'be', 'made', 'endless', 'line', 'women', 'waiting', 'sleep', 'man', 'who', 'wheel', 'drives', 'circles', '170', 'mph', 'Maybe', 'being', 'born', '10-15', 'years', 'fact', 'factors', 'bit', 'difficult', 'believe', 'drivers', 'were', 'basically', 'porn', 'stars', 'women', 'lusted', 'threw', 'drivers', 'were', 'members', 'Beatles', 'film', 'early', 'moments', 'are', 'intriguing', 'core', 'first', '30', 'so', 'minutes', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'pissing', 'contest', 'two', 'stubborn', 'men', 'acting', 'children', 'little', 'tiresome', 'reach', 'pro', 'circuit', 'Then', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'queen', 'taking', 'minor', 'roles', 'bigger', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'Rush', 'will', 'reel', 'heart', 'pounding', 'breathtaking', 'racing', 'sequences', 'biographical', 'action', 'film', 'will', 'win', 'over', 'compassion', 'Absolutely', 'exhilarating', 'amusing', 'passionate', 'very', 'end', 'Rush', 'film', 'right', 'be', 'as', 'good']",Rush

1631721,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B00BEIYP1W,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[2, 2]","Ron Howard's Rush succeeds on two levels, as a compelling story for the non-race fan and sufficiently accurate for the Formula 1 fan.The film is about the fierce competition between two Formula 1 drivers, James Hunt and Nikki Lauda. The central piece of the film is the 1976 racing season where Nikki Lauda is badly burned in a horrific crash. The two drivers are polar opposites, Hunt loved fast cars, fast women, and a fast life; Lauda was the technician who worked hard and was serious about everything. The differences between the two make for a fantastic drama.The casting was perfect. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) plays James Hunt the perfect combination Val Kilmer, Jim Morrison, and sex symbol. Daniel Br&uuml;hl (Bourne Ultimatum and Inglorious Basterds) does a magnificent job as the calculating and angered Nikki Lauda.This is a review of the theatrical release.Ron Howard and screenwriter Peter Morgan knew nothing about Formula 1 before they embarked on this film. I was convinced this film would go the Days Of Thunder direction. Thankfully they spent a lot of time with Nikki Lauda and some other drivers to get things closer to right. They still missed at times; the film isn't perfect from a racing perspective. They did a good enough job to keep the film entertaining without going crazy on racing details. Lauda has endorsed this film.Ron Howard appropriately paid homage to Grand Prix (there were several shots that looked exactly like James Garner in the 1960's car) and Le Mans; two of the greatest racing films ever made. This film concentrated more on the dramatic on track conflict between Hunt and Lauda and less on the backdrop love story that bogged down Grand Prix. Howard did not fall in the massive bear trap of over juicing the racing footage - Days Of Thunder and Driven being the worst racing films ever made. He did misstep a few times, drawing in a bit of NASCAR with two cars banging wheels. In Formula 1, open wheel racing, those two cars would have flown off the track and not just bounced off each other. There were a few moments where cars flew past each other, another Hollywood trick that doesn't ever happen in a real race. Other than those small things, the racing was well done. They bolted cameras all over the cars, including inches above the ground from underneath. In a day when there are constant in car cameras during actual races, it is hard to come up with new angles for racing. Rush found those new different angles.I liked the mix of historic footage and similar new footage that had an old school heavy grain to it. They did a masterful job blending those elements. Surprisingly the film was shot exclusively in Germany and the UK. Through editing and careful dressing they managed to make that footage look like tracks all over the world. They didn't do very well with Monaco, I'm not sure where they shot those short segments, but something was wrong with them. The cars from 1976 were beautiful. It was so wonderful to see those cars on a track running again. The sound was incredible - the rasp of those engines was superb.The film is rated R for nudity, language, and drugs. Strong language is used a lot in the film. The nudity is brief glimpses of women's breasts and full rear nudity of Chris Hemsworth (which would have passed for late prime time television). Drugs use is shown several times. There were several scenes about 2/3 of the way through the film that I couldn't bear to watch. Lauda's crash - I knew it was coming, I knew which race it happened at; but knowing didn't prepare me for how brutal it was and how it was depicted on the screen. I honestly, closed my eyes at that moment. I couldn't bear to watch the scenes in the hospital with the bandages and his lungs being vacuumed out. For those reasons, this is probably a film best left to mature audiences.Rush was an exciting film that I enjoyed a lot.",4,Good Racing Footage,1380240000,"09 27, 2013",2013,3880,"['Ron', 'Howard', 'Rush', 'two', 'levels', 'compelling', 'story', 'non-race', 'fan', 'sufficiently', 'accurate', 'Formula', '1', 'fan.The', 'film', 'fierce', 'competition', 'two', 'Formula', '1', 'drivers', 'James', 'Hunt', 'Nikki', 'Lauda', 'central', 'piece', 'film', '1976', 'racing', 'season', 'where', 'Nikki', 'Lauda', 'badly', 'burned', 'horrific', 'crash', 'two', 'drivers', 'are', 'polar', 'opposites', 'Hunt', 'loved', 'fast', 'cars', 'fast', 'women', 'fast', 'life', 'Lauda', 'was', 'technician', 'who', 'worked', 'hard', 'was', 'serious', 'everything', 'differences', 'two', 'make', 'fantastic', 'drama.The', 'casting', 'was', 'perfect', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Thor', 'James', 'Hunt', 'perfect', 'combination', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'sex', 'symbol', 'Daniel', 'Br', 'uuml', 'hl', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'Inglorious', 'Basterds', 'magnificent', 'job', 'calculating', 'angered', 'Nikki', 'Lauda.This', 'review', 'theatrical', 'release.Ron', 'Howard', 'screenwriter', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 'knew', 'nothing', 'Formula', '1', 'embarked', 'film', 'was', 'convinced', 'film', 'would', 'go', 'Days', 'Thunder', 'direction', 'Thankfully', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'Nikki', 'Lauda', 'other', 'drivers', 'get', 'things', 'closer', 'right', 'still', 'missed', 'times', 'film', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'racing', 'perspective', 'did', 'good', 'enough', 'job', 'keep', 'film', 'entertaining', 'going', 'crazy', 'racing', 'details', 'Lauda', 'endorsed', 'film.Ron', 'Howard', 'appropriately', 'paid', 'homage', 'Grand', 'Prix', 'were', 'several', 'shots', 'looked', 'exactly', 'James', 'Garner', '1960', 'car', 'Le', 'Mans', 'two', 'greatest', 'racing', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'film', 'concentrated', 'more', 'dramatic', 'track', 'conflict', 'Hunt', 'Lauda', 'less', 'backdrop', 'love', 'story', 'bogged', 'down', 'Grand', 'Prix', 'Howard', 'did', 'not', 'fall', 'massive', 'bear', 'trap', 'juicing', 'racing', 'footage', 'Days', 'Thunder', 'Driven', 'being', 'worst', 'racing', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'did', 'misstep', 'few', 'times', 'drawing', 'bit', 'NASCAR', 'two', 'cars', 'banging', 'wheels', 'Formula', '1', 'open', 'wheel', 'racing', 'two', 'cars', 'would', 'have', 'flown', 'off', 'track', 'not', 'just', 'bounced', 'off', 'other', 'were', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'cars', 'flew', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'trick', ""n't"", 'ever', 'happen', 'real', 'race', 'Other', 'small', 'things', 'racing', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'bolted', 'cameras', 'cars', 'including', 'inches', 'ground', 'underneath', 'day', 'when', 'are', 'constant', 'car', 'cameras', 'actual', 'races', 'hard', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'angles', 'racing', 'Rush', 'found', 'new', 'different', 'angles.I', 'liked', 'mix', 'historic', 'footage', 'similar', 'new', 'footage', 'had', 'old', 'school', 'heavy', 'grain', 'did', 'masterful', 'job', 'blending', 'elements', 'Surprisingly', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'exclusively', 'Germany', 'UK', 'editing', 'careful', 'dressing', 'managed', 'make', 'footage', 'look', 'tracks', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'well', 'Monaco', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'shot', 'short', 'segments', 'something', 'was', 'wrong', 'cars', '1976', 'were', 'beautiful', 'was', 'so', 'wonderful', 'see', 'cars', 'track', 'running', 'again', 'sound', 'was', 'incredible', 'rasp', 'engines', 'was', 'superb.The', 'film', 'rated', 'R', 'nudity', 'language', 'drugs', 'Strong', 'language', 'used', 'lot', 'film', 'nudity', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'women', 'breasts', 'full', 'rear', 'nudity', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'would', 'have', 'passed', 'late', 'prime', 'time', 'television', 'Drugs', 'use', 'shown', 'several', 'times', 'were', 'several', 'scenes', '2/3', 'way', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'bear', 'watch', 'Lauda', 'crash', 'knew', 'was', 'coming', 'knew', 'race', 'happened', 'knowing', 'did', ""n't"", 'prepare', 'how', 'brutal', 'was', 'how', 'was', 'depicted', 'screen', 'honestly', 'closed', 'eyes', 'moment', 'could', ""n't"", 'bear', 'watch', 'scenes', 'hospital', 'bandages', 'lungs', 'being', 'vacuumed', 'out', 'reasons', 'probably', 'film', 'best', 'left', 'mature', 'audiences.Rush', 'was', 'exciting', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'lot']",Rush

His (many) business endeavors failed, and he did sell his family estate, but he was hardly a ruined man were finances are concerned...he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth...those types rarely get what they truly deserve.Enzo Ferarri was a big A-Hole...and the movie got it right...they should get on their knees and Thank God for Niki Lauda. He really opened their eyes to modern Formula One racing, and more importantly, BUILDING. Untill that time, Enzo was stuck in the past...race cars were built for power and speed...Damn the weight, safety, handling, stopping, etc etc etc. Niki Lauda was the force that was big enough to open the Ears and shut the Mouth of Enzo  Ferarri.What can you say...a story like this can never be told in a 2 hour movie. It seemed like it was half that long, so it must have been a good film. If it was 2 days long, it would only have been able to tell 2% of the whole story.Niki and James were almost made for each other. It harks back to a much better time in Formula One...when horse power was more reasonable, and the drivers actually had to &#34;heal and toe&#34;  (toe and toe is more like it)...they had to shift and double clutch A LOT in those days...that is a BIG SKILL that no longer exists...a lot of racing disappeared when those stupid paddle shifters came on board.Anyway...watch the movie, it is quite good. Buy their books if you want to know the real story of these two guys. I spent a dollar and a half at Red Box to see this...not sure I would pay 20 bux...but that is all relative to how much money you have to spend.

1631733,A2HD6G443MGH2A,B00BEIYP1W,dookerJ,"[2, 3]","Formula 1 is just such an amazing sport, and the story told about the 1970s rivalry, the accident, the emotions, the psychology of it all, it is absolutely mind-blowing.  Ron Howard never fails to disappoint.  Even if you're a NASCAR fan or some other type of racing, you'll appreciate this movie for a lot of reasons.  This is a thrilling, amazing piece of film, and really captures the essence of the ups and downs (and the bleeding edge) of 1970s Formula One Racing.  It's deep and emotional, yet technical and takes a true story and makes it outstanding to watch.  The film intimately explores the lives of the two drivers and the culture surrounding them.  The framing of the famous N&uuml;rburgring race, with the rain, the silhouette of a spider on the wall...  The commentary is fairly identical to that which I've heard watching F1 before, so Howard got it right there, though they focus slightly more on technical aspects of the cars at least these days.  It's also an amazing feat in that F1 is a global touring sport, so you get to see so many countries represented as settings; you go all around the world.  My only small beef is probably the long pit/tire change times; I know they were slower back then, but I don't think they were slow enough to have a full conversation.  Lauda's injury and subsequent hospitalization scenes are really painful to watch; you can almost feel his pain just seeing it, but I'm sure reality it was much worse an ordeal.  Regardless, the film has global appeal, and Howard really pushed filmmaking to new heights.The actors/casting are particularly outstanding as well...  Seeing Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br&uuml;hl in the lead roles, along with the rest of the cast, it really feels like they studied not only the script for the film, but all the history and footage surrounding it (and a bit of old footage is even spliced in, very well done).  This may be the performance of Hemsworth's life!  He and Bruhl are as professional as it gets as acting goes here.  Extremely well done in every aspect.  It's just mind-blowing that the sport that has become slightly safer today, was so all-or-nothing; they were literally sitting on rocketships with bombs under their seats.  The drama is interweaved with excellently shot, high-speed racing scenes.  This is the kind of film that will make you laugh, cry, and your heart beat out of your chest.  Bravo!In the US, as of this writing, it's still in theaters, but on the PS3/PS4 (PSN) at least, you can get it before it comes to dvd/br/digital download (I think it may be a Sony exclusive).One other note, not really exclusive to this film, but, there has been a real lack of R-rated movies as of late.  I don't know if this has to do with economics and the studios' fears of taking the risk on R-ratings, but some of the greatest films (thinking back to the 80s especially) have been R-rated films; studios often have to cut down R-rated films just to aim for a PG-13 rating, and we don't get to see what the filmmaker intended.  Here, I think you get to see everything Howard wanted.  This is a good thing.  I think the R-rated trend is re-emerging (Lone Survivor, etc), and I hope it will continue to do so.  Producers should lean into their fear and take the risks on these kinds of films, the same way Lauda leaned into his fear and took on racing even after suffering a loss.",5,Incredible,1389744000,"01 15, 2014",2014,3374,"['Formula', '1', 'just', 'such', 'amazing', 'sport', 'story', 'told', '1970s', 'rivalry', 'accident', 'emotions', 'psychology', 'absolutely', 'mind-blowing', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'never', 'disappoint', 'Even', ""'re"", 'NASCAR', 'fan', 'other', 'type', 'racing', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'movie', 'lot', 'reasons', 'thrilling', 'amazing', 'piece', 'film', 'really', 'essence', 'ups', 'downs', 'bleeding', 'edge', '1970s', 'Formula', 'One', 'Racing', 'deep', 'emotional', 'yet', 'technical', 'true', 'story', 'outstanding', 'watch', 'film', 'intimately', 'lives', 'two', 'drivers', 'culture', 'surrounding', 'framing', 'famous', 'N', 'uuml', 'rburgring', 'race', 'rain', 'silhouette', 'spider', 'wall', 'commentary', 'fairly', 'identical', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'watching', 'F1', 'so', 'Howard', 'got', 'right', 'there', 'focus', 'slightly', 'more', 'technical', 'aspects', 'cars', 'least', 'days', 'also', 'amazing', 'feat', 'F1', 'global', 'touring', 'sport', 'get', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'countries', 'represented', 'settings', 'go', 'world', 'only', 'small', 'beef', 'probably', 'long', 'pit/tire', 'change', 'times', 'know', 'were', 'slower', 'back', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'were', 'slow', 'enough', 'have', 'full', 'conversation', 'Lauda', 'injury', 'subsequent', 'hospitalization', 'scenes', 'are', 'really', 'painful', 'watch', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'pain', 'just', 'seeing', ""'m"", 'sure', 'reality', 'was', 'much', 'worse', 'ordeal', 'Regardless', 'film', 'global', 'appeal', 'Howard', 'really', 'pushed', 'filmmaking', 'new', 'heights.The', 'actors/casting', 'are', 'particularly', 'outstanding', 'as', 'well', 'Seeing', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Daniel', 'Br', 'uuml', 'hl', 'lead', 'roles', 'rest', 'cast', 'really', 'studied', 'not', 'only', 'script', 'film', 'history', 'footage', 'surrounding', 'bit', 'old', 'footage', 'even', 'spliced', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'may', 'be', 'performance', 'Hemsworth', 'life', 'Bruhl', 'are', 'as', 'professional', 'acting', 'here', 'Extremely', 'well', 'done', 'aspect', 'just', 'mind-blowing', 'sport', 'become', 'slightly', 'safer', 'today', 'was', 'so', 'all-or-nothing', 'were', 'literally', 'sitting', 'rocketships', 'bombs', 'seats', 'drama', 'interweaved', 'excellently', 'shot', 'high-speed', 'racing', 'scenes', 'kind', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'cry', 'heart', 'beat', 'chest', 'Bravo', 'US', 'writing', 'still', 'theaters', 'PS3/PS4', 'PSN', 'least', 'can', 'get', 'dvd/br/digital', 'download', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'Sony', 'exclusive', '.One', 'other', 'note', 'not', 'really', 'exclusive', 'film', 'been', 'real', 'lack', 'R-rated', 'movies', 'late', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'do', 'economics', 'studios', 'fears', 'taking', 'risk', 'R-ratings', 'greatest', 'films', 'thinking', 'back', '80s', 'especially', 'have', 'been', 'R-rated', 'films', 'studios', 'often', 'have', 'cut', 'down', 'R-rated', 'films', 'just', 'aim', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'what', 'filmmaker', 'intended', 'Here', 'think', 'get', 'see', 'everything', 'Howard', 'wanted', 'good', 'thing', 'think', 'R-rated', 'trend', 're-emerging', 'Lone', 'Survivor', 'etc', 'hope', 'will', 'continue', 'do', 'so', 'Producers', 'should', 'lean', 'fear', 'take', 'risks', 'kinds', 'films', 'same', 'way', 'Lauda', 'leaned', 'fear', 'took', 'racing', 'even', 'suffering', 'loss']",Rush

Directly inspired by the real men behind the story, its depiction of both personalities, warts and all, is masterful. Ron Howard's always known which strings to tug for maximum emotional impact in his work, but that usually comes at a price: simple, one-dimensional caricatures at the helm. Rush represents an evolution for the director; he no longer shies away from the darker, less desirable elements of his leading man/men, and that strong investment in their development pays dividends at the climax. The pulse-pounding F-1 scenes are gripping and intense - I'd expect no less from today's bombastic Hollywood effects departments - but the real attraction is the race that goes on away from the track, as two dedicated drivers break themselves in half to one-up a lifelong rival.

1631740,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00BEIYP1W,FNDNreview,"[6, 8]","Any racing fan will tell you that racing is only as interesting as the rivalries between the drivers.  This should come as no surprise since rivalry prompts individual drive, forcing the competitors to be on the top of their game - with the ultimate goal of victory.  Just a few of the countless and illustrious rivalries in the world of motorsports has included both driver and manufacturer.  On the manufacturing side, there has almost always been a long standing competition between the Ford Mustang and Chevy Camaro.  Once you move on from the manufacturer rivalry, there are team rivalries, one of which is the ongoing feud between Hendrick Motorsports and Penske Racing in the Sprint Cup Series, a feud that began when the series was still known as the Winston Cup Series.  And, since we're talking about the Winston Cup Series, it's absolutely impossible to forget the rich and always entertaining feud between Dale Earnhardt and Jeff Gordon.  However, before the Earnhardt met Gordon, possibly the greatest rivalry in all of racing had already taken place - in the Formula One Series.  Of course, this rivalry - between James Hunt and Niki Lauda is the subject of the new biopic, Rush.Hollywood legend Ron Howard (Apollo 13, Frost/Nixon, The Da Vinci Code) directs Rush, the parallel true story about Formula One race car drivers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) in the 1970s.  Hunt is a womanizing playboy, reckless behind the wheel, and egotistical to the max - but he knows how to win races.  On the flip side, Lauda is a ""straight edge"" driver that focuses solely on winning.  At the height of his career, Hunt first experiences Lauda as he buys his way into racing, quickly making a name for himself by winning an F1 champion - at Hunt's expense, of course.  With each passing race, the two drivers intertwine with one another more and more, often trading wins - at least until an unfortunate accident sidelines Lauda, essentially changing their relationship forever.  Olivia Wilde, Alexandra Maria Lara, and Pierfrancesco Favino also star in supporting roles.Depending how you feel about racing and motorsports, this film has the potential to either feel like a high-octane trip down memory lane or like watching cars simply drive in a circle for two hours (the equivalent for some of watching paint dry).  Honestly, and this comes from someone that grew up during the era of Earnhardt/Gordon - it can be a bit of both.  If you're hoping for constant wreckage and fistfights between Hunt and Lauda, you're going to be massively disappointed.  That's not who these guys were, and their relationship was not as aggressive as the rivalries between Earnhardt and Gordon or the current petty fights between countless drivers all over modern motorsports.  It would be impossible to describe the relationship between Hunt and Lauda as a gentlemen's relationship, but it's not as though they hated each other either.  In fact, it would appear that they despised each other far more in this film than in real life.  However you'd describe their relationship, it was certainly entertaining and a big deal for the F1 Series.Without a doubt, Rush is dominated by the onscreen presence of Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br&uuml;hl.  Not only do the characters portrayed in this film push one another to greatness, but these two exquisite actors also push each other, endlessly feeding thriving in their respective roles.  Hemsworth portrays a brash, borderline alcoholic that loves the limelight, while Br&uuml;hl is calm, collected and ready for business.  The egos of these two characters may be on the opposite side of the spectrum in terms of how they go about their lives off the track, but on the track - there might be no better pair to mirror one another in the history of motorsports. On the outside, their relationship may have appeared to be of the tumultuous variety, but this film portrays them as men desperate to out due one another on the track.  There's a great deal of admiration for men like that.Obviously, since Rush is centered squarely on two men, it doesn't leave a whole lot of room for supporting characters to make an impression.  This will come as disappointing news for Oliva Wilde fans, as she only briefly appears in the film - as Hunt's wife and eventual ex-wife.  Although she can be a compelling actress (based on certain roles), she isn't allotted the time to leave a meaningful impression.  However, Wilde's counterpart, Alexandra Maria Lara, portrays Niki Lauda's wife - and is present for much more emotional and engaging scenes.  Through sheer silly luck, Lara's character meets her future husband as she's leaving a party, and from there, her character is enthralled with Niki's drive and passion for racing.  The complexity of the Lauda marriage is given far more screen time, while the Hunt marriage is depicted as nothing more than a brief shame, in an attempt to give James Hunt a more acceptable public appearance.  In defense of the film's lopsidedness, James Hunt does spend much of his time womanizing rather than romancing.For anyone that's a fan of the 1990 racing flick Days of Thunder, you might just enjoy Rush as much, possibly more - unless you have a bias for stock cars over open wheel cars.  It's brutally obvious that a comparison to Days of Thunder and Rush is not fair (based on the overall quality of the completed products), but you can't help but look at the storyline involved with each film and see some familiar parallels.  Both focus on egotistical men, followed by a tragic accident that defines the film, and finally, each flick ultimately ends in a positive nature.  The quality of acting in Rush is far more impressive than in Days of Thunder, but it's hard not to look at Rush as something more than Thor womanizing, drinking, and trying to play Tom Cruise.  This shouldn't take away from the performance of Hemsworth, but as far as the entertainment value goes, it feels like there should be an asterisk next to Rush - since it obviously came nearly 25 years later, yet still resembling a similar story.Overall, Rush is a biopic that tells an interesting story, but does it using a plot that still feels far too familiar.  Unfortunately, the real life relationship between James Hunt and Niki Lauda was not as dramatic as it's made out to be in the film.  Still, Director Ron Howard creates a nice, free flowing film that rivals his work on his previous accolades, including Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind.  With quite a bit of Oscar buzz around it, the question becomes:  is Rush a serious Oscar contender?  If Rush can remain relevant despite peaking early, it should be appear to climb its way into contention.  Although a high entertainment value is present in this film, very little about it screams Academy Award.GRADE:  B-FNDNreview.com",4,Hemsworth & Br&uuml;hl go the distance in 'Rush',1380585600,"10 1,

1631748,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00BEIYP1W,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","`Everyone's driven by something' is the perfect tag line for this intense film by director Ron Howard and writer Peter Morgan that successfully revisits the sexy, glamorous golden age of Formula 1 racing in the 1970s. The film is based on the true story of a great sporting rivalry between handsome English playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth), and his methodical, brilliant opponent, Austrian driver Niki Lauda (Daniel Br&uuml;hl). The story follows their distinctly different personal styles on and off the track, their loves and the astonishing 1976 season in which both drivers were willing to risk everything to become world champion in a sport with no margin for error: if you make a mistake, you die. The love interest are provided by actresses Natalie Dormer, Olivia Wilde, Alexandra Maria Lara and the supporting cast is full of fine actors, Pierfrancesco Favino as Clay Ragazzoni among them.The film focuses as much on the internal struggles these opposite drivers had as much as it does on the racing tracks. Philosophical questions are raised that pertain to any sport and Ron Howard knows ho to bring that into focus. Both lead actors are exceptional, with Daniel Br&uuml;hl - false teeth and all - turning in a fully realized performance as the severely burned but not battered Niki Lauda. This is an action film with doubt, but it is also a psychological dramatization of a true story that for once works very well on film.

Each men thinks he's made better by the other, his arch nemesis, his enemy. What is common among these two men is they both think the other one is better than him. Just one shows it though.  The action is alive in a very futuristic Instagrammish fashion. However, at times, I did the feel the film was trying too hard and was even a bit cheesy but the good news is you end up liking both the protagonists too much to really care. Ever since Senna, I have found myself vaguely interested in F1 racing. This film shows two outlandish drivers both with very different school of thoughts, both far from perfect temperament and both hungry for approval. The character build up was very nice, so were the introductory scenes, I loved a scene where two fans meet one of the two popular drivers and go bonkers.  As good as the action was, I felt it could have been a little less &#34;fake&#34; and a bit more &#34;reel&#34; real. Maybe 20% more effort into showing the driving tactics and the film would have been a lot better. It seems Ron Howard should have made this film a bit more &#34;Senna&#34; and a little less &#34;Wanted&#34; if you catch my drift. Overall, I liked it a lot and yes it definitely worth viewing again in the future. The music will cause many adrenaline rushes to flow through your body.

But over the course of just over 2 hours, thanks to some terrific performances by Chris Hemsworth (THOR) and Daniel Bruhl (INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, THE FIFTH ESTATE), and some fine directing by Howard, we learn a great deal about who they are, and why their rivalry was so important to the history of racing.Taking place in the early to mid 1970's, Hunt is a gorgeous hunk of a Brit, able to charm the pants off of just about anyone he meets, particularly the ladies. Lauda is a self-important, supremely arrogant Austrian whose mouth gives him somewhat rat-like features. The only thing these two have in common is that they both want to race Formula 1. Hunt is getting by on his looks, charm, and natural ability, while Lauda is getting by on his smarts and his discipline. When they first meet to race, they instantly hate each other, but their abilities on the track are significant enough to start a great rivalry. When ladies get involved in their lives, again, they are opposites. Hunt marries the beautiful model Suzy (Olivia Wilde) and Lauda marries the loving and comparatively plain Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara). Hunt blows off his marriage, but Lauda finds something of a peace in his. All their rivalries culminate during one race season where a dangerous race (one that Lauda tried to stop but Hunt rallied his fellow racers to allow to proceed) has Lauda crashing and burning all too literally. As he recuperates in the hospital, and watches Hunt gather up enough victories to possibly take the world champion title away from him, Lauda summons up the strength to get back behind the wheel for a pulse-pounding finale.The film has a decent flow to it, and the racing scenes are among the most exciting and realistic in recent memory; a far cry from the gleeful vehicular insanity of the FAST AND FURIOUS films. Hemsworth and Bruhl give terrific performances, but the supporting cast leaves a lot to be desired. This is a film about men in a man's world, like many of Ron Howard's films (BACKDRAFT, APOLLO 13), and the women in the film are shafted. The film never really fizzles because Howard is smart enough to keep the racing rivalry front and center to create tension, but it never really shines off the track nearly as much as it does on it since Howard can't really find a rhythm when both his leads aren't on screen.RUSH is a well-made film with two terrific leading performances, but the scenes not between Hunt and Lauda off the racetrack have the film hitting the brakes.",4,A nicely character-driven drama of the Ron Howard model.,1400198400,"05 16, 2014",2014,2790,"['When', 'one', 'first', 'down', 'watch', 'director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Formula', '1', 'racing', 'drama', 'RUSH', 'first', 'question', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'ask', '34', 'Who', 'hell', 'are', 'James', 'Hunt', 'Niki', 'Lauda', '34', 'most', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'first', 'clue', 'Formula', '1', 'racing', 'totally', 'valid', 'question', 'course', 'just', '2', 'hours', 'thanks', 'terrific', 'performances', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'THOR', 'Daniel', 'Bruhl', 'INGLOURIOUS', 'BASTERDS', 'THE', 'FIFTH', 'ESTATE', 'fine', 'directing', 'Howard', 'learn', 'great', 'deal', 'who', 'are', 'why', 'rivalry', 'was', 'so', 'important', 'history', 'racing.Taking', 'place', 'early', 'mid', '1970', 'Hunt', 'gorgeous', 'hunk', 'Brit', 'able', 'charm', 'pants', 'just', 'anyone', 'particularly', 'ladies', 'Lauda', 'self-important', 'supremely', 'arrogant', 'Austrian', 'mouth', 'somewhat', 'rat-like', 'features', 'only', 'thing', 'two', 'have', 'common', 'want', 'race', 'Formula', '1', 'Hunt', 'getting', 'looks', 'charm', 'natural', 'ability', 'Lauda', 'getting', 'smarts', 'discipline', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'race', 'instantly', 'hate', 'other', 'abilities', 'track', 'are', 'significant', 'enough', 'start', 'great', 'rivalry', 'When', 'ladies', 'get', 'involved', 'lives', 'again', 'are', 'opposites', 'Hunt', 'beautiful', 'model', 'Suzy', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'Lauda', 'loving', 'comparatively', 'plain', 'Marlene', 'Alexandra', 'Maria', 'Lara', 'Hunt', 'marriage', 'Lauda', 'something', 'peace', 'rivalries', 'culminate', 'one', 'race', 'season', 'where', 'dangerous', 'race', 'one', 'Lauda', 'tried', 'stop', 'Hunt', 'rallied', 'fellow', 'racers', 'allow', 'proceed', 'Lauda', 'crashing', 'burning', 'too', 'literally', 'hospital', 'watches', 'Hunt', 'gather', 'up', 'enough', 'victories', 'possibly', 'take', 'world', 'champion', 'title', 'away', 'Lauda', 'up', 'strength', 'get', 'back', 'wheel', 'pulse-pounding', 'finale.The', 'film', 'decent', 'flow', 'racing', 'scenes', 'are', 'most', 'exciting', 'realistic', 'recent', 'memory', 'far', 'cry', 'gleeful', 'vehicular', 'insanity', 'FAST', 'AND', 'FURIOUS', 'films', 'Hemsworth', 'Bruhl', 'give', 'terrific', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'film', 'men', 'man', 'world', 'many', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'films', 'BACKDRAFT', 'APOLLO', '13', 'women', 'film', 'are', 'shafted', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'Howard', 'smart', 'enough', 'keep', 'racing', 'rivalry', 'front', 'center', 'create', 'tension', 'never', 'really', 'shines', 'off', 'track', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'Howard', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'rhythm', 'when', 'leads', 'are', ""n't"", 'screen.RUSH', 'well-made', 'film', 'two', 'terrific', 'leading', 'performances', 'scenes', 'not', 'Hunt', 'Lauda', 'racetrack', 'have', 'film', 'hitting', 'brakes']",Rush

Since then, he has built a storied, award-winning career; now he has come full circle to another auto-racing film. This biography is based on the true story of an Austrian Formula One champion and his British arch rival. I found it thrilling, involving and highly entertaining.We see:* Daniel Br&uuml;hl (""Ladies in Lavender"") as three-time Formula One champ Niki Lauda, a buttoned-down technocrat, friendless and charmless, but a brilliant analyst who understands all the elements of racing: the track, the engine, the body, the weight, and above all, the competition.* Chris Hemsworth (""Thor"") as handsome James Hunt, exuding the joie de vivre of international success. He revels in the booze, the drugs and the women that go along with fame and is always the darling of the press because he is so quotable.* Olivia Wilde (""The Change-Up"") as Suzy Miller, soon to be the famous supermodel Suzy Hunt, who swans into Hunt's life and quickly marries him, much to their mutual regret.* Alexandra Maria Lara (""Imagine"") is Marlene, who marries Lauda almost on a whim, but who remains in his life as his staunchest friend and ally.Howard gives us a soundtrack that shakes the theater as those powerful engines roar into life, but never neglects the dialogue: We hear every single spoken word in a script where much of the fun is what our two rivals say to (and about) each other. Their top-notch competition brings up the game for both, so they come to realize they need each other. Lauda says, ""I learn far more from my enemies than from my friends.""We already know from reading about this film, that neither one dies in any of the horrific crashes we see, so this isn't a spoiler, but I found comfort knowing in advance that despite treacherous rainstorms and challenging race tracks, these guys still will be with us in the final frame.

1631774,A2PUA6GJJJQKTD,B00BEIYP1W,Jay Chen,"[2, 3]","Rush runs contrary to the formulaic trends in filmmaking, producing a unique movie that is both interesting and memorable.  The central story (no spoilers) is about a rivalry between the two central characters, James Hunt and Niki Lauda - both of whom are trying to break into the big leagues of Formula One racing.  Hunt, played by Chris Hemsworth (Thor), is a charismatic, hard partying playboy whose recklessness in life translates into brilliance as a racer.  Lauda, played by Daniel Bruhl, is something of a mirror image.  He's an abrasive, mechanical genius who views the sport purely as a monetary exercise.  The personal aversion between the two is instantaneous and a huge rivalry ensues as both clamor for recognition as the best in the world.As a film, Rush succeeds on multiple levels, combining very solid cinematography together with a storyline that&#8217;s both interesting and engaging.  There is a bit of a back and forth throughout the movie as you alternate between the personal lives of Lauda and Hunt and the races.  And while some of it is predictable, there are several points along the way where you&#8217;re dealt some major surprises (unless you know the historical backstory).  And the story grows too, progressing from something that is initially entertaining to something that's emotionally gripping.The cinematography is outstanding.  As there are numerous races, some of the chronicling is done as a montage, which is understandable given the number of years they must cover.  However, some key races are handed in depth and the experience is both highly immersive and visually engaging.  Some of the weather sequences are particularly worth mentioning.Rush is memorable.

Yet, they have drawn out the engaging true story, in a manner which transcends the car racing story background.- For many people, the story is past history - it's about another era. The period has been recreated faithfully and sympathetically.- The real life drama has been presented accurately and without embellishment. This is a testiment to the skill of the writer and director. And, while being historically accurate, the movie builds genuine tension and drama.- This is not just a car race story- it's about the triumph of two men against adversity, and in that respect, it is genuinely inspirational.- The storyline is multi-layered: there's the lives and distinctive personalities of the two protagonists, their rivalry, the racing, as well as the main characters' romances.

1631787,AAU5MAMZRRR80,B00BEIYP1W,John Milton,"[4, 6]","This could so easily have just been another race movie, like 'Days of Thunder' and appealed to the petrolheads exclusively. However, with Ron Howard at the helm and a tremendous true story to work from, this film was simply brilliant.Rush follows the rivalry between Formula One drivers James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Bruhl). Two men who are poles apart in their approach to their chosen profession but both driven by the same ultimate goal.Understandably, there is a degree of dramatisation of the rivalry between Hunt and Lauda, including the fabrication of events that never happened and omitting certain interesting facts: such as Hunt and Lauda shared a flat in London early on in their careers.The chemistry between Hemsworth and Bruhl is brilliant. Hemsworth's portrayal of Hunt was excellent and there wasn't a trace of his native Aussie tongue in his upper-crust English accent! Bruhl as the clinical Lauda was nothing short of perfect and both lead actors performances made for compelling viewing.Perhaps having an American at the helm led to a more balanced film as Hunt and Lauda were both portrayed as very human and flawed characters where it would have been so easy to simply portray them as mere stereotypes; and I was glad that neither man was characterised as the villain of the piece.Although I commented that this wasn't a film just for petrolheads, I don't think F-1 fans will be left disappointed. I was particularly impressed by the race scenes and the authenticity of the film in general, capturing the essence of the mid-1970s beautifully. The story itself is intelligent with a touch of humour but due to the subject matter, is also exciting and times deeply dramatic. The tragedy that befell Lauda is dealt with admirably and in unflinchingly real fashion. Lauda himself has commented on its portrayal in this film. Additionally, Rush does not shy away from Hunt's use of drugs, failed marriage and also sensitively narrated his passing.I'm not a fan of Formula One or motor racing in general but to date, Rush is unquestionably my film of the year.",5,Unquestionably my film of the year!,1380326400,"09 28, 2013",2013,2084,"['could', 'so', 'easily', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'race', 'movie', ""'Days"", 'Thunder', 'appealed', 'petrolheads', 'exclusively', 'However', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'helm', 'tremendous', 'true', 'story', 'work', 'film', 'was', 'simply', 'brilliant.Rush', 'rivalry', 'Formula', 'One', 'James', 'Hunt', 'Hemsworth', 'Niki', 'Lauda', 'Bruhl', 'Two', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'poles', 'apart', 'approach', 'chosen', 'profession', 'driven', 'same', 'ultimate', 'goal.Understandably', 'degree', 'dramatisation', 'rivalry', 'Hunt', 'Lauda', 'including', 'fabrication', 'events', 'never', 'happened', 'omitting', 'certain', 'interesting', 'facts', 'such', 'Hunt', 'Lauda', 'shared', 'flat', 'London', 'early', 'careers.The', 'chemistry', 'Hemsworth', 'Bruhl', 'brilliant', 'Hemsworth', 'portrayal', 'Hunt', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', ""n't"", 'trace', 'native', 'Aussie', 'tongue', 'upper-crust', 'English', 'accent', 'Bruhl', 'clinical', 'Lauda', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'perfect', 'lead', 'actors', 'performances', 'made', 'compelling', 'viewing.Perhaps', 'having', 'American', 'helm', 'led', 'more', 'balanced', 'film', 'Hunt', 'Lauda', 'were', 'portrayed', 'very', 'human', 'flawed', 'characters', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'easy', 'simply', 'portray', 'mere', 'stereotypes', 'was', 'glad', 'man', 'was', 'characterised', 'villain', 'piece.Although', 'commented', 'was', ""n't"", 'film', 'just', 'petrolheads', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'F-1', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'disappointed', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'race', 'scenes', 'authenticity', 'film', 'general', 'capturing', 'essence', 'mid-1970s', 'beautifully', 'story', 'intelligent', 'touch', 'humour', 'due', 'subject', 'matter', 'also', 'exciting', 'times', 'deeply', 'dramatic', 'tragedy', 'befell', 'Lauda', 'dealt', 'admirably', 'unflinchingly', 'real', 'fashion', 'Lauda', 'commented', 'portrayal', 'film', 'Additionally', 'Rush', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'Hunt', 'use', 'drugs', 'failed', 'marriage', 'also', 'sensitively', 'narrated', 'passing.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Formula', 'One', 'motor', 'racing', 'general', 'date', 'Rush', 'unquestionably', 'film', 'year']",Rush
1631788,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00BEIYP1W,John's Horror Corner,"[47, 52]","In many ways Rush was nothing like what I expected.  When I think of driving/racing movies I think of The Transporter (2002), Fast Five (2011), Driven (2001) or Drive (2011).  While these movies vary wildly in quality (some action movies, a competitive bro flick and a one legit film), they all have VERY exciting driving scenes.  These movies also feature some aging bro-mentor meets wildcard rookie moments (Driven), intense stoic Albert Brooks and head stomping scenes (Driven), some serious jump spin kicks bringing Hong Kong cinema to America (The Transporter) and an international pec dance-off between Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel (Fast Five).  Sure, there are some heavy moments surrounding the driving scenes in all these movies.  But, far to the contrary, Rush's driving scenes were the least exciting scenes of the entire film...and in no way is this to the film's detriment.Rush chronicles the ascension of James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth, deflated from his Thor role) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) from their humble Formula 3 beginnings up to the contentious glory of Formula One.  Their actions and dialogue, whether to, about or because of one another, illustrate their dependence on each other which subsequently fuels their  addiction to competition.  Each minute of this movie is every bit a duel as Rocky versus Ivan Drago and they bring out the very best (and the very worst) in each other.But this ""race car"" movie hardly focuses on ""action"" or ""racing"" at all.  But it is every bit about the intensity ""of"" the race...and the rush experienced by its competitors.  This film is about the relationship and rivalry between of Hunt and Lauda, not the engines behind which they sit.  As such, while almost every scene is effective and elicits sneers, gasps, laughs or sympathy--none of the major action or excitement takes place while the cars are actually moving.  Quite to the contrary, the drivers rev their engines and scream around the track as Hans Zimmer's soulful score builds to something powerful.  However, the crescendo is not found in gasp-worthy maneuvers or photo finishes.  It's what happens when the cars ""aren't"" racing that is exciting.  The drama and humor finds us ""before"" setting foot in the car.  Frustrations and conflict are expressed when the cars pit.  And your greatest shock occurs not in anticipation of a crash, nor at the devastating contact of it.  No...  The heaviest moments in this film occur during the 90 seconds ""after"" the collision that leads to the crash and ""after"" the car has come to a complete stop!  Yet more intensity is found as Lauda perseveres and recovers from irrecoverable injuries driven to resume his race against Hunt for the 1976 championship.  You may not find it with the wind blowing through your hair on a sun-soaked day, but you will feel the rush and see the magnitude of the races through a different lens altogether.But still, the cinematography does its part, seizing the drivers' hesitation with stunning rainy competition shots, speeding fish-eye lens framing and grounded POV angles.Playing the three-time champ Lauda, Daniel Br&uuml;hl masters his role as the rigid, obsessive, friendless and charmless Austrian.  His tactful brilliance oozed a preternaturally meticulous fluency of all things racing--from track to engine and from the car to the man.  Lauda's complete opposite, Chris Hemsworth champions the devilishly charming Brit, James Hunt.  Whereas Lauda remains determined, never letting his victories blur his focus, Hunt basks in international success, sexual conquest and alcoholic bliss.  It's a wonder his cause of death wasn't being crushed to death under a pile of beautiful women.  The press and the ladies alike adore this dashing silver-tongued hero.A cameo by Natalie Dormer (Game of Thrones) swiftly ignites the screen with Hunt's sexuality.  But as the film shifts from ascension to harsh conflict, Olivia Wilde assume the role of supermodel Suzy Miller.  As Hunt's wife, however briefly and tragic their marriage, she serves as little more than an emotionless frame depicting from within the image of Hunt's downward spiral.  Serving quite a different purpose as Marlene Lauda, Alexandra Maria Lara breathes life into Niki Lauda, humanizing his otherwise coarse persona and bringing him to the realization that greater happiness can be found off the track than forever chasing the next technical victory on the horizon.

My thoughts on the movie Rush.Rush is based on the true stories of formula 1 race drivers Niki Lauda and James Hunt. In Rush, James is classified as being an arrogant, drug addicted playboy. Then we have Niki who not only has a heart for formula 1, but also has the skill set and drive.  But once these two meet each other, it begins an unforgettable rivalry.Rush has a lot to love and a lot to offer as a movie. I should start by mentioning that this movie has some of the best cinematography I have seen in a movie (sorry Gravity) and the set pieces are very convincing.Among the many great performances of the whole movie, Daniel Bruhl's performance (which got a lot of acclaim) is absolute fire. Like, I really can not understand why the certain movies/actors/actresses get nominated in favor of others that actually deserve it, but I should not start an unecessary rant on how I feel about the Motion Picture Academy. Nonetheless, His performance was nothing short of brilliant. Chris Hemsworth's performance was gratifying as well. Great job with the acting.To close, Rush triumphs due to the fact that all acts are perfectly executed, the acting/chemistry on both ends is equally sharp, and its overall setup and direction is boldly sequenced.

Certainly the actors are more present in Rush than in McQueen's great film about racing.  Unfortunately, for those of us who have put our butt in a car, who have experienced even a moment of that bolt of lightening... It's still a movie.  The Hunt/Lauda rivalry is significantly overblown in this movie but like all Directors, Ron Howard had to have some kind of plot...  It's exceptionally well filmed, it's brilliantly acted, particularly Lauda's role.  Hemsworth is truly brilliant.

Watching the film now, I express my bewilderment at this film not being nominated. It's a great film. Solidly filmed, and well scripted, this was a very well crafted biographical sports drama and I'll tell you why. My review of 'Rush'.'Rush' tells the tale of James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), as two highly skilled race car drivers, who form a rivalry that lasted from 1970 to 1976. James, a stubborn, dimwitted, and slacker, and Niki, a smart, calculated jerk, face off against each other to win the Championship for the Grand Prix.'Rush' is a very well handled racing film. What surprises me is that it is more character driven then actual race car sequences, something you hardly see in these type of films. This not only helps the tension level when the racing scenes do occur, but it helps make the characters more human than one dimensional figures just following a script.The film was well written by 'Peter Morgan' who seemingly puts the characters first, and the stunts, and car's second. He balances both Lauda and Hunt's separate story arcs perfectly, keeping each of them in tune with the other, not giving one more screen time then another. Morgan develops his character's well, and the dialogue is un-cringworthy. He even makes characters likable even when they seem to not be, that helps to make the film more enjoyable.The film is well handled by director 'Ron Howard' who has provided us with the likes of 'The DaVinci Code' and 'Apollo 13'. He handles the material he is given wisely. His camera work is impressive to say the least, especially during the racing sequences. We are brought into the action being put right in front of the racer, or in the vehicle... And the crash sequences... wow. Not to mention the climax of the film was eye widening beautifully shot, with the rain and all.The film is lead by two impressive performances from 'Chris Hemsworth' and 'Daniel Bruhl'. Hemsworth gives his all, and ends up successfully giving probably his best performance to date as Hunt. He seems to have tons of fun as the character and it plays well on screen. Even better is the relative unfamiliar face Bruhl, whose name is familiar outside the U.S but rather unheard of here in the states. He is powerful as Lauda, his eagerness to win, and evil-genius like qualities are transferred to Bruhl successfully.I do however feel the film get's to be a bit to much spanning for over 2 hours. I felt it had a little excess that needed to be trimmed off to make this a more straightforward film, as to help it not lag along so much as it did.All and All, 'Rush' is a beautifully filmed, solidly scripted, and powerfully performed film from director 'Ron Howard' that's more about the characters then noisy racing sequences, which works well.

You probably know the ones, those with bare bones plots that seem designed only for stars yearning to drive fast cars on screen. While there are exceptions, most are yawn-worthy.But director Ron Howard has managed to keep Rush exciting enough to merit its title. This character-driven tale of two men fighting for the 1976 Formula One championship is compelling. Actor Chris Hemsworth brings the sexy and charming racer James Hunt superbly to life - and Daniel Bruhl does equally well in evoking the darker persona of Nikk Lauda.The result? A tense and suspenseful rivalry between guys with extremely different personalities. The turbulent (to put it mildly) relationship between the men was the prime reason I enjoyed this film so much. The shots of the race cars in action, dramatic as they were, simply wouldn't have done the trick for me.But the racing shots are still very impressive, with views from inside drivers' helmets and just about every angle imaginable. And of course there is the roar of the cars and the screams of the fans to ramp up the excitement factor. The result is a film designed to please both those who love to watch race cars speeding around a track - and those who don't.",5,Hate auto racing movies?

Perhaps the subject matter of Formula 1 racing was a turn-off for some, but even to non-aficionados (like myself,) the movie is too well-made and the subject too compelling to deny that this is a superb film in all measures of filmmaking.What distinguishes this story from countless other sports movies is its pair of protagonists who are also the other's nemesis. It seems like almost every other film in the genre relies on the clich&eacute;d format of having a clear hero defeat an enemy in a big showdown, if not on the scoreboard then at least on a moral level. However, &#34;Rush&#34; provides a fresh take on competition by having two fascinating heroes to cheer for and against, since both men equally divide the viewer's affection. The film's poster may highlight just a giant mugshot of Thor, but this film is definitely about two men and their complex relationship over the years. Both leads are perfect foils for one another, as one is a cheerful charmer while the other is a brooding intellectual. The movie skillfully balances either at times to be the hero or villain, though both men share the same consuming passion for victory, yet are also victims of enormous ego. While Chris Hemsworth is quite fantastic, costar Daniel Br&uuml;hl gives a truly sublime and star-making performance that surely heralds many lead roles to come.The film is gorgeous too, from the European environments to the weather and tracks. Everything is lushly captured to give personality to every setting and race. The '70s time period is also nicely recreated in all elements of attire, music and style.&#34;Rush&#34; is a spectacular accomplishment in cinema for evolving the sports genre in a thoughtful, powerful and mature way.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[7, 7]","The rivalry between James Hunt and Nikki Lauda though of comparatively short duration, was nevertheless one of the greatest rivalries in sporting history.  The stakes were huge: life, death, the world championship.Even though I did not follow Formula 1 racing then or ever, I clearly remember when this rivalry went global with badly burned reigning Formula One world champion Nikki Lauda being pulled out of a burning car at a grand prix, by his rival drivers. Almost dead from his injuries, it looked like his season if not his career was over.I also clearly remember watching the charismatic James Hunt being interviewed about the subject.  Considerably behind Lauda on points in the world championship, his act of getting out of the car to help rescue Lauda could have potentially ruined his own ambitions to become world champion.  Truly, this is one of the most remarkable sporting rivalries of all time.So, it was with more than a little anticipation that I looked forward to watching Ron Howard's take on these events done with the cooperation of Nikki Lauda.  James Hunt sadly died of a heart attack in 1993 at age 45.If you are like me, you do not have to be a big racing fan to enjoy this.  Everyone understands we live in a world of rivalry and competition, and Ron Howard does an admirable job in this movie in crafting one of the most memorable movies of the year.While I was one of the few people not very impressed with the movie Thor, there is no doubt in watching this movie that Chris Hemsworth does an awesome job as James Hunt, easily matching the charisma of the great character, who was both a charmer and a legendary womanizer, and that Hemsworth is a great star.  I consider this to be his best role to date.The title Rush is quite appropriate as you may experience a certain rush of adrenaline in watching the movie.I think the movie in a way balances perfectly, because if you are like me, as you watch, clearly as a social guy Hunt steals the show, and as a technical and methodical racer, Lauda is superior.  In a way they come across as total opposites, yet at the end one does admire both, Lauda for his heroic comeback showing what a true competitor he is, and Hunt for his charisma and skill.Rush is jam packed with interesting events.

It captured the excitement of the 1976 Formula One season with reasonable accuracy and sense of action and drama. Acting was very good all around.The move had close collaboration of Niki Lauda himself.One can find endless minor discrepancies or absences, but the general idea was kept intact.Examples of different things in the movie in comparison with real life:a. Lauda raced Formula Two a lot before going to Formula 1. He did not jump to Formula One directly from Formula Three.b. The movie does not show that team Hesketh won a race with James (Netherlands 1975)c. The movie repeats the often mentioned error that Hunt needed a third place at Japan to be champion (if Lauda did no score). No. James needed a fourth place, since they would be euqla in points (68) and Hunt would win the title for having more victories (6 against 5).But these are very small discrepancies that do not damage the whole.I enjoyed this movie a lot, the best movie I watched in 2013 (in theaters).",5,"The best racing movie ever (after Grand Prix, of course!)",1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,1196,"['way', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'nothing', 'will', 'ever', 'surpass', '1966', '34', 'Grand', 'Prix', '34', 'best', 'racing', 'car', 'movie', 'ever', 'least', 'best', 'FOrmula', 'One', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', '.Anyway', '2013', '34', 'Rush', '34', 'simply', 'fantastic', 'captured', 'excitement', '1976', 'Formula', 'One', 'season', 'reasonable', 'accuracy', 'sense', 'action', 'drama', 'Acting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'around.The', 'move', 'had', 'close', 'collaboration', 'Niki', 'Lauda', 'himself.One', 'can', 'find', 'endless', 'minor', 'discrepancies', 'absences', 'general', 'idea', 'was', 'kept', 'intact.Examples', 'different', 'things', 'movie', 'comparison', 'real', 'life', 'a.', 'Lauda', 'raced', 'Formula', 'Two', 'lot', 'going', 'Formula', '1', 'did', 'not', 'jump', 'Formula', 'One', 'directly', 'Formula', 'Three.b', 'movie', 'not', 'show', 'team', 'Hesketh', 'won', 'race', 'James', 'Netherlands', '1975', 'c.', 'movie', 'often', 'mentioned', 'error', 'Hunt', 'needed', 'third', 'place', 'Japan', 'be', 'champion', 'Lauda', 'did', 'score', 'No', 'James', 'needed', 'fourth', 'place', 'would', 'be', 'euqla', 'points', '68', 'Hunt', 'would', 'win', 'title', 'having', 'more', 'victories', '6', '5', 'are', 'very', 'small', 'discrepancies', 'do', 'not', 'damage', 'whole.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'lot', 'best', 'movie', 'watched', '2013', 'theaters']",Rush

Doesn't matter because this story was always going to get my attention.  In fact rarely have I looked to forward to a film.  I was not disappointed.I won't go through the premise here.  If you're reading this I expect you already know it.  I will say that this film travels at a pace akin to the cars it features.  There's not a moment to get bored or for the mind to wander.  To the contrary.  I wanted every scene to be longer, I wanted to spend more time with these people.  I was hungry to know them, flaws and all.  This is no glossed up little package of hero-worship.  Both Hunt and Lauda are as selfish and spiteful as they are inspiring and talented.The music is brooding, compelling and exciting by turn.  The camera work is intimate and amazing.  (You see through Niki's bury eyes, you see from inside helmets and from under and along the cars.  You see every shudder they make.  You see eyelashes and pores and ruined skin as well as stunning scenery.  You struggle to see through the rain.  You see through the flames, you see and hear what Lauda saw and head in that fiery minute (and sit glad you can't feel it).I wasn't sure how I'd take the most confronting action, the crash and the painful hospital scenes and I admit going into it a little apprehensive.  They aren't easy watching but neither are they overdone.  It's all very matter-of-fact. Horrible but nothing that can't be pushed through.  Not lingered on, not brushed over and I was glad for it. It had to be done that way to understand what Lauda actually overcame.While the race action was outstanding the best part, of course, was the interaction between Hunt and Lauda.  Every scene between them was charged (and in my opinion mostly too brief).  I could have watched those two talking for the whole running time.  Their dynamic is fascinating, the place they played in each others lives and careers slowly unfolds as you come to know them both and understand that each would likely have been something a little less without the other.  Despite people comparing them to Prost and Senna almost incessantly, by the end they reminded me much more of Senna and Berger, one serious and driven, the other understanding the vital importance of adding a little fun.  Both pairs added a similar balance to each others existence.Bruhl and Hemsworth are pitch perfect (as are everyone involved).  I wasn't surprised on Bruhl's front but it's hard to get from the preview the depth that Hemsworth would have to work with.  Happily he found those depths and plundered them.  There is so much more to his Hunt than a womanising baffoon, as their should be.  This is a key role for both actors but especially to showcase the serious acting skill that Hemsworth hasn't had so much of a chance to display.  The preview actually hinted at a more one dimensional take but it was good to see the serious side of James and Niki's little sparks of humour and delight too (played to perfection).  I ended up caring a great deal for these characters, warts and all.  This is one film I would line up to get an extended edition of but it also sparked my interested in finding out more about these characters.  It's not a documentary, things have been changed, Hunt and Lauda have been polarised a but more than they were in reality, but it's still damn good fun and has real history to depart as well.Of course the final recommendation is the most important.  Niki Lauda himself was very pleased with the outcome.  That is good enough for me.",5,My only complaint?

Rush accurately conveys the compelling drama of the traveling circus that is F1. The film compares favorably with not just other racing films but also other great sports films like Hoosiers. Watching past racing movies I found the racing sequences to be quite gripping while the off the track drama and dialog never shined, boring. Movies like Bobby Deerfield (Pacino) boring, Grand Prix (James Garner)and Le Mans (McQueen) boring, boring.The script in Rush is high quality supercharged. The script follows real life drivers Niki Lauda & James Hunt in the years leading up to and competing for the 1976 World Championship. It is no secret that Hunt and Lauda had opposing personalities and prepared for competition in starkly different ways. This contrast is shown to great effect in the relationships they have with friends & confidants, women, team owners and journalists. By the time they make it to the closing races of the 1976 season the drama and excitement have you hooked.Formula One, like other sports(think Magic vs Bird in the 80s) has had great years with high drama- recall the 2008 F1 season when the world championship was decided on the last lap of the last race. But F1 has also had the not so great(think late 1990s, early 00s when Schumaker had the championship wrapped up by mid season....yawn). But 1976 was a great year and director Howard was right to focus his cameras on that year as two outstanding drivers with interesting personalities fought it out(watch for a cameo by the six wheeled Tyrell). Most Americans do not follow F1 (their loss). The outstanding script and compelling action on the track (turn up the home theatre speakers)make this a film that F1 enthusiasts and casual fans alike will find entertaining.",5,Entertaining movie about great sports rivalry,1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,1802,"['F1', 'fan', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Rush', 'accurately', 'conveys', 'compelling', 'drama', 'traveling', 'circus', 'F1', 'film', 'favorably', 'not', 'just', 'other', 'racing', 'films', 'also', 'other', 'great', 'sports', 'films', 'Hoosiers', 'Watching', 'racing', 'movies', 'found', 'racing', 'sequences', 'be', 'quite', 'gripping', 'off', 'track', 'drama', 'dialog', 'never', 'shined', 'boring', 'Movies', 'Bobby', 'Deerfield', 'Pacino', 'boring', 'Grand', 'Prix', 'James', 'Garner', 'Le', 'Mans', 'McQueen', 'boring', 'boring.The', 'script', 'Rush', 'high', 'quality', 'supercharged', 'script', 'real', 'life', 'drivers', 'Niki', 'Lauda', 'James', 'Hunt', 'years', 'leading', 'up', 'competing', '1976', 'World', 'Championship', 'secret', 'Hunt', 'Lauda', 'had', 'opposing', 'personalities', 'prepared', 'competition', 'starkly', 'different', 'ways', 'contrast', 'shown', 'great', 'effect', 'relationships', 'have', 'friends', 'confidants', 'women', 'team', 'owners', 'journalists', 'time', 'make', 'closing', 'races', '1976', 'season', 'drama', 'excitement', 'have', 'hooked.Formula', 'One', 'other', 'sports', 'think', 'Magic', 'vs', 'Bird', '80s', 'had', 'great', 'years', 'high', 'drama-', 'recall', '2008', 'F1', 'season', 'when', 'world', 'championship', 'was', 'decided', 'last', 'lap', 'last', 'race', 'F1', 'also', 'had', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'think', 'late', '1990s', 'early', '00s', 'when', 'Schumaker', 'had', 'championship', 'wrapped', 'up', 'mid', 'season', '.yawn', '1976', 'was', 'great', 'year', 'director', 'Howard', 'was', 'right', 'focus', 'cameras', 'year', 'two', 'outstanding', 'drivers', 'interesting', 'personalities', 'fought', 'out', 'watch', 'cameo', 'six', 'wheeled', 'Tyrell', 'Most', 'Americans', 'do', 'not', 'follow', 'F1', 'loss', 'outstanding', 'script', 'compelling', 'action', 'track', 'turn', 'up', 'home', 'theatre', 'speakers', 'make', 'film', 'F1', 'enthusiasts', 'casual', 'fans', 'alike', 'will', 'find', 'entertaining']",Rush

1631840,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00BEIYP1W,M. Oleson,"[9, 10]","Theatrical review.Ron Howard, like most directors, has had his share of hits and misses.  His one previous ""sports"" movie was the underappreciated ""Cinderella Man"" from 2005.  He takes another stab with this exhilarating film which depicts the competition between two men who are polar opposites except in their desire to win.  Winning means taking the Formula 1 driving championship of 1976.Based on real characters and real events, Chris Hemsworth (""Thor"") plays British playboy James Hunt.  His nemesis is unlikeable and demanding, but determined and detailed.  Austrian driver, Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl, ""Inglourious Basterds"") is more focused on the curves of the race course than on the curves on a woman.  We see the two drivers beginning in the smaller F3 circuit.  But both are impatient.  Lauda has access to money and buys his way in to F1 with his investment.  Hunt is sponsored by British Lord Hesketh (Christian McKay), a man with money but even he has his limits.  Two women enter their lives.  Model Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde) eventually becomes Mrs. Hunt.  And why not?  I couldn't help but think I've not seen 2 more beautiful people on screen at one time than Hemsworth and Wilde.  I digress.  By accident, the unpopular Lauda meets Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara), a romantic partner of actor Curd Jurgens.  Marlene becomes a strong influence on Niki, eventually bringing out a more humanistic side, especially after his near fatal crash.  Suzy and James are in a crash and burn relationship of a different kind.This movie, however is about the relationship and the competitive nature between Hunt and Lauda.  That is their one link.  Competition.  It brings out the best and the worst of each.  Hemsworth and Bruhl give terrific performances.  Howard, aided by Peter Morgan's screenplay gives cautioned insight into what makes each man tick.  It's a simple story really.  Each motivates the other.  Each wants to be the best.  Their approaches are different and they are certainly of different personalities.  Hunt is gifted, popular and loves the life that goes with the job.  For Lauda, less athletic perhaps, but uses the science of the sport and strong work ethic to become better.Hans Zimmer adds a very good musical score to the film and the editing is first rate.  I would also be remiss if not mentioning the spectacular racing scenes shot by cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle.  They are numerous and even for someone not particularly interesting in auto racing, exciting and spectacular.  There are never two races that seem the same, either from the way they are shot or by the racing environment.  The races shot during driving rain storms are harrowing.  Find yourself a great seat in the middle and in front of a big screen and engulf yourself with as many speakers as you can find.

It is not long before we see them competing at the highest level, and it all leads to the 1976 season, where things would come to a head. To tell you much more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, director Ron Howard deserves a ton of credit for faithfully and painstakingly recreating what life was like in Europe in the early 70s, both on the race track and off the race track. I mean, it is spot-on. Howard also manages to overcome the challenge of how to bring a riveting sports movie when you already know how it all ends (maybe not so much in the US, where interest in and audiences for F1 racing are not nearly as big as the rest of the world). Second, the lead actors Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt and Daniel Br&uuml;hl as Niki Lauda are terrific. I am floored to see that only Hemsworth (as Hunt) is on the DVD jacket of this movie, as it is as much the story of Lauda, if not more so, than Hunt's. Apart from these two, there are several smaller roles that are worth noting, none more so that Olivier Wilde as Hunt's girlfriend/eventual wife. There is also a very nice soundtrack for this movie, including the original score (by veteran Hans Zimmer), but also plenty of early 70s music which you will immediately recognize if you grew up in that era (such as Mud's Dyna-Mite, Slade's We're All Crazy Now, Thin Lizzy's The Rocker, etc).Can this movie appeal to a large US audience that is not necessarily interested in or familiar with Formula One racing from 40 years ago?  I am not your typical US movie goer, as I grew up in Belgium and seeing this movie was like being transported back in time. I turned 16 on the very day of the N&uuml;rburgrin accident (I will never forget that). That said, I was (pleasantly) surprised that the screening I saw this at today here in Cincinnati was packed! On top of that, there was applause from the audience when the end credits started to roll. I'm not sure if this is indicative of the overall box office chances but I sure hope so. If you like a riveting sports drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end, you cannot go wrong with this.

I just bought the Blu-Ray recently because I wanted to hear those awesome engines and sound effects in an uncompressed audio format.  I was not disappointed as the audio on my home theater system completely outclasses the compressed streaming version I had seen prior.  Watching the film on my PS4 with the Linear PCM audio option and it sounded like I was in the middle of a real racing event.The audio is not the only awesome part though.  The film was shot digitally with the popular Arri Alexa camera. The video transfer is clean, sharp, and very detailed.  There is a unique color palette to the film that was applied to give the it a look of a movie from the era the story takes place in. The combination of this crisp high resolution image to the unique color correction make for a great looking film.The story is interesting and of course based in reality. With Nikki Lauda being involved in the assistance with production, one can hope that most of what we see is true to life but I am sure there is some artistic license used. Regardless of the authenticity of every word or scene the movie plays out very nicely. It is story told from both sides, one from James Hunt played by Hemsworth, and other from Nikki Lauda's perspective played by Bruhl.  Both performance are great but Bruhl had the greater challenge in having to pull off an accent that is very close to that of Lauda's.  There are times where it might be nice to get into both characters personal stories deeper. These are the limitations though to a feature film when you are trying to service two characters both equally well in two hours and still tell the story. Despite the limitations of character depth the story is never told favoring one driver over the other.  Depending on who you are you will likely respect both men or favor one slightly. No one is made out to be a bad guy. Both men are presented with the positives and negatives of who they were in Blunt's care or are in Lauda's. They are both flawed with the irony being that if they combined personalities they would have balance and be a better person. Maybe that is why there was a personal relationship of respect that developed going beyond driver rivalry between them. They saw something in each other they wished they could have in themselves but realized they never would.This is a great film and disc and I would highly recommend it.",5,Enjoyable F1 History Dramatized,1403481600,"06 23, 2014",2014,2470,"['missed', 'movie', 'theater', 'got', 'watch', 'digital', 'download', 'last', 'year', 'just', 'bought', 'Blu-Ray', 'recently', 'wanted', 'hear', 'awesome', 'engines', 'sound', 'effects', 'uncompressed', 'audio', 'format', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'audio', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'completely', 'compressed', 'streaming', 'version', 'had', 'seen', 'prior', 'Watching', 'film', 'PS4', 'Linear', 'PCM', 'audio', 'option', 'sounded', 'was', 'middle', 'real', 'racing', 'event.The', 'audio', 'not', 'only', 'awesome', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'digitally', 'popular', 'Arri', 'Alexa', 'camera', 'video', 'transfer', 'clean', 'sharp', 'very', 'detailed', 'unique', 'color', 'palette', 'film', 'was', 'applied', 'give', 'look', 'movie', 'era', 'story', 'place', 'combination', 'crisp', 'high', 'resolution', 'image', 'unique', 'color', 'correction', 'make', 'great', 'looking', 'film.The', 'story', 'interesting', 'course', 'based', 'reality', 'Nikki', 'Lauda', 'being', 'involved', 'assistance', 'production', 'one', 'can', 'hope', 'most', 'what', 'see', 'true', 'life', 'am', 'sure', 'artistic', 'license', 'used', 'Regardless', 'authenticity', 'word', 'scene', 'movie', 'out', 'very', 'nicely', 'story', 'told', 'sides', 'one', 'James', 'Hunt', 'played', 'Hemsworth', 'other', 'Nikki', 'Lauda', 'perspective', 'played', 'Bruhl', 'performance', 'are', 'great', 'Bruhl', 'had', 'greater', 'challenge', 'having', 'pull', 'off', 'accent', 'very', 'close', 'Lauda', 'are', 'times', 'where', 'might', 'be', 'nice', 'get', 'characters', 'personal', 'stories', 'deeper', 'are', 'limitations', 'feature', 'film', 'when', 'are', 'trying', 'service', 'two', 'characters', 'equally', 'well', 'two', 'hours', 'still', 'tell', 'story', 'limitations', 'character', 'depth', 'story', 'never', 'told', 'favoring', 'one', 'driver', 'other', 'Depending', 'who', 'are', 'will', 'likely', 'respect', 'men', 'favor', 'one', 'slightly', 'one', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'bad', 'guy', 'men', 'are', 'presented', 'positives', 'negatives', 'who', 'were', 'Blunt', 'care', 'are', 'Lauda', 'are', 'flawed', 'irony', 'being', 'combined', 'personalities', 'would', 'have', 'balance', 'be', 'better', 'person', 'Maybe', 'why', 'was', 'personal', 'relationship', 'respect', 'developed', 'going', 'driver', 'rivalry', 'saw', 'something', 'other', 'wished', 'could', 'have', 'realized', 'never', 'would.This', 'great', 'film', 'disc', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend']",Rush

Not so with RUSH. In what is the best film that Ron Howard has done in years, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl give excellent performances as James Hunt and Niki Lauda: Formula One drivers whose rivalry gave each other purpose and motivation to succeed. As personalities, they couldn't have been more different. James Hunt was brash, more of a ladies' man and reveled in the fame that being a race car driver afforded. Niki Lauda was more cold, calculating and concerned with the technical aspects of racing, and he could also be quite blunt. What I liked about this movie, aside from the racing aspect, was the examination of these two polar opposite personalities and the way in which they pushed each other forward. There is plenty of screen time allotted to establishing their characters, and once they meet, sparks fly. I thought both Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl did an excellent job in portraying these two men, and made it seem very believable. Of course, this is a racing movie, so the other question would be how that aspect stacks up. No lie, this movie had some of the best, and most thrilling racing sequences I've seen. Ever. Apparently, they had actual drivers (and the actors) drive Formula One cars at high speeds and attached cameras to the outside to capture the feel of what it would be like to be in one of those cars. It was really exhilarating stuff, and it's a pity that I wasn't able to catch this in theaters when it first came out. I also should mention the incredible score by Hans Zimmer, who is quickly becoming one of my favorite film composers. He created an epic feel, not unlike what he did with Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. Still, it was distinct from that iconic score and added a lot to the overall feel of the film. There was also a good selection of 1970's classic rock. Overall, there's not a thing I can think of that's even a little wrong with this film. Every aspect of it perfectly displays the skills of the talent involved, and the central story elevates it above your typical sports drama.

Zwick,"[14, 32]","***1/2Ron Howard's ""Rush"" relates the true-life tale of two Formula One racecar drivers - Britain's James Hunt and Austria's Niki Lauda - whose intense rivalry helped to define the sport in the 1970s.As befits a pair of arch competitors, Hunt and Lauda were polar opposites in any number of ways. Hunt, the ""bad boy,"" was a hard-drinking, hard-living international playboy-type with a crappy marriage - his supermodel wife (Olivia Wilde) was having an affair with no less a figure than Richard Burton - while Lauda, the ""good-boy,"" was a work-obsessed, early-to-bed homebody with a terrific marriage to a beautiful and devoted woman (Alexandra Marlena Lara). Hunt was also devilishly handsome and sexy, a fact which garnered him a bevy of overeager groupies and celebrity status, while Lauda, with his self-described ""rat face,"" barely registered as a blip on the cultural scene. The movie chronicles their relationship - defined by incidents of high drama and near-tragedy - both on and off the track, with each developing a grudging admiration for the other's doggedness, tenacity and undeniable devotion to the sport over time.The movie has a number of things going for it. The screenplay by Peter Morgan doesn't dumb down the characters or over-dramatize the conflict between them. In addition, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl are excellent as Hunt and Lauda, underplaying rather than grandstanding their way through their roles. And, of course, it goes without saying that the racing sequences, though truncated at times, plunge the audience right into the heart of the action in a way not available even to real-life fans of the sport, be they sitting in the stands at the track or watching at home on TV. Once again, the intimacy of the medium of film makes itself felt in a major way.Why then the overall feeling of dissatisfaction with the film, the nagging sense that, for all the quality elements that have gone into it, the movie just doesn't amount to all that much in the end? Could it be that, when all is said and done, the story really isn't all that interesting or the characters all that compelling (Hunt's wife is given particularly short shrift in the screenplay)? Whatever it is, there is something about ""Rush"" that keeps us from giving ourselves over to it completely.

The race is exciting on and off the tracks. Directed with precision and heart by Ron Howard, ""Rush"" runs on adrenaline at 220 miles an hour and the audience is instantly in an unforgettable ride. Chris Hemsworth plays the reckless charismatic English playboy Jim Hunt, and Daniel Bruhl gives a spot on performance of meticulous and serious Austrian racer Niki Lauda.  The story would be unbelievable if it wasn't true. But Director Ron Howard has brought to life all the excitement of the 1976 Grand Prix complete with the personal stories of Hunt and Lauda.  The film is gripping and a visual rush as Academy award cinematographer Anthony Dodd Mantle puts the viewer directly in the driver seat.  Hans Zimmer's  moves the story in a wonderful and pulsating soundtrack. The drama depicts rivals Hunt and Lauda and the incredible events that lead to the perilous Nurburgring race and finally the Japanese Grand Prix.  As each driver accrues points in each race, they reach the dangerous rain drenched final head to head for the championship title. ""RUSH"" is an exhilarating film between  two talented drivers beautifully performed by Hemsworth and Bruhl. The lives and personalities of these two drivers couldn't be more different and yet their respect and admiration for each other and passion for racing formula 1 is palpable.

1631910,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B00BEIYP1W,Steven Aldersley,"[4, 5]","I remember the marketing campaign for Rush, which claimed it was unmissable and full of thrills. While I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, it's definitely not as advertised.It's actually better, but in a different way.The movie performed badly at the US box office, making just $27 million. Formula One racing isn't very popular in North America, so it's not hard to see why audiences weren't anxious to see the movie in theaters.The story focuses on the 1976 Formula One championship, which came down to a battle between two men:James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) was an English playboy more interested in pursuing the lifestyle of a superstar than devoting his life to his career. We see him drinking, smoking, and chasing beautiful women. He's carefree, controversial and irresponsible. In contrast, Austrian Niki Lauda (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) will do anything to succeed. He takes care of his health, goes to bed early, and seemingly has more knowledge of how to get the best out of his car than his mechanics and the team owners.An early scene shows how Hunt and Lauda first raced together in the lower Formula Three class. Lauda is forced off the track by Hunt and takes an instant dislike to him. Over a period of six or seven years, the rivalry intensifies. Success in Formula One racing depends on the competitiveness of the car as much as the ability of the driver. Lauda negotiates a deal to drive for one of the best teams, Ferrari. Hunt resorts to begging for a position with any team that will give him a car good enough to compete. He eventually signs with Hesketh.You might think that a movie about car racing would be full of action, but director Ron Howard spends more time off the track than on it. He develops the plot by showing us the contrast between Hunt and Lauda. As well as character differences, they came from very different backgrounds. Hunt's family was rich and prepared to buy him a place on a team, but Lauda was disowned by his father after choosing racing over a more traditional career. We see Lauda succeeding on his own merit rather than being handed anything. While Hunt pursues any attractive woman who will spend the night with him, Lauda chooses a supportive woman who ended up being married to him until 1991.Formula One racing is a glamorous sport. In 2013, two drivers earned $27 million in salary alone. Sponsorship deals would vastly increase that sum. If you have ever watched a race, you'll have seen the celebrities in attendance, as well as a horde of beautiful women. The movie speculates that women like racing drivers because they are so close to death, and that makes them more alive than other men. It also helps that they are incredibly rich. An early voice-over informs us that of the 25 drivers in Formula One, two will probably die by the end of the season. Although that was true at the time, safety has improved enormously since the 1970s.Will the movie work for you if you know nothing about Formula One? I grew up following the sport and still watch every race today. I have no interest in any other type of car racing. It's hard for me to imagine watching the movie without the knowledge I have gained over a lifetime, but I would think that the story has plenty to offer those who know nothing about the sport. It should work if you enjoy character studies. As for the acting, many think that Br&uuml;hl should have received an Oscar nomination, while I have never seen Hemsworth deliver a better performance. The story is interesting and quite gripping. It felt as if only an hour had passed by the time that the credits rolled.Writer Peter Morgan has given us some great stories set in the 1970s. He teamed up with Ron Howard for Frost/Nixon, which received international acclaim, while Tom Hooper's The Damned United does an excellent job of portraying English soccer.If you are curious about seeing the film for the racing sequences, you might be disappointed. I would estimate that around 30 minutes is devoted to the actual races. Those sequences are done very well, and really give you an idea of what it might be like to drive a Formula One car. Howard also shows the dangers involved, and how a serious accident can occur in a split second. But there is a lot more to this movie than action sequences.The Blu-ray delivers a spectacular presentation. Colors are vibrant, features are clear, and the audio is excellent when it needs to be. With ten deleted scenes and just over an hour of special features in total, the package offers plenty of insight into the making of the movie and Formula One in general.Rated R for sexual content, nudity, language, some disturbing images and brief drug use.",4,A gripping character study with realistic action sequences,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,4657,"['remember', 'marketing', 'campaign',

Both racers are in a league of their own when racing against each other. Niki is strict about how he goes through life. He is a perfectionist. He believes in order for him to win races everything must be right. James on the other hand is going with the flow in life. He is a partier and likes enjoy simple pleasures. He also takes bigger chances in his racing ability that no one else would dare to take. Both showed struggles in beginning of their careers as Niki took out a loan and put himself in the highest level of competition, Formula One, from the beginning. While James raced mostly in Formula Three dominating everyone until he had an opportunity to race in Formula One. However, James is unable to race in Formula One his first season with the lack of sponsors so he only races a couple of tracks that season. He ends up going through a depression stage, and loses hope of racing again. However, he starts to gain some hope and it isn&#8217;t until the next season he gets a sponsorship and now he must prove to the world that he has what it takes to beat Niki Lauda.I really enjoyed the James Hunt and Niki Lauda rivalry they had going on. They both were to totally different people. One was a perfectionist that nobody really cares for but was a respected driver on the track. The other was a partier that every girl wanted to sleep with but was ridicule for his actions off the track. That is what made this rivalry unique in a way. It shows both drivers in great detail throughout the movie, so it would give you the anticipation by the end of the movie who would actually win the title of World Champion that season. This rivalry started when Niki Lauda actually lost to James Hunt in a Formula Three race in the beginning of the movie. At the time, James Hunt didn&#8217;t realize that would be his main competition throughout the movie. Even though the two were totally opposite people they both recognized each other as worthy opponents and push each other to their individual limitsFor a racing movie, I really like how they directed it.

Some of the best stories on sports of course are done beautifully by Disney, but Rush, the story of a legendary Formula 1 rivalry from the 1970's was meant for an adult audience.This film has everything you want a rich story of the famous rivalry of Niki Lauda and James Hunt as they both collide one two different paths towards being the greatest in Formula 1 racing. The film gives us some of the best acting from Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl (OSCAR SNUB!), even an unlikely one from Olivia Wylde. A powerful score from Hans Zimmer drives this high octane drama making the movie feel a lot shorter than it actually is. The stories of both of these racers captures their own personal goals and ambitions beautifully and even though the story is far from over when the credits roll you are left satisfied with the film as a whole.I have no idea why this movie did not get any recognition at the Academy Awards.

The true story it's based on is astonishing.The movie is powered by the great performances by Helmsworth and Bruhl, portraying in very nuanced fashion the true love-hate relationship they had. The movie evokes the danger of the sport in the great racing sequences, but especially in the lead up to one race where it's raining and foggy but postponement is not an option since the TV rights have been sold worldwide. The drivers know full well they could die...that scene is spine-tingling with a palpable sense of dread, and the whole movie has a tense undercurrent because of the danger of what they are doing. The 70's was an era where seemingly the safety technology had not been keeping pace with engine technology, making it an ever more dangerous undertaking.I almost gave this film a miss as I felt the cheese factor could be high with Ron Howard directing. But it got some amazing reviews. I was very pleasantly surprised that indeed, this is a great film and probably the best thing Ron Howard's ever done (though I do remember Apollo 13 was really good too.)

For those who care: this is one of only two hollywood movies that I know where the germans (austrians) actually speak german. Lauda is still on TV in Germany now and then, and the actor has had plenty of practice in copying the way he speaks. lauda is sharp and to the point in real life, made the quib about the ass being able to feel the road and forces being key to Micheal Schumacher.I did not like that the film felt small at all times. no use at all of all the lovations tthe formula one visits. nothing daring at all in the movie about the last daredevils the world had left. tepid movie sex scenes, a slight but half hearted attempt to make some of the film look like private pictures may have looked in that era. however, not much attempt to make the era come alive.The Film hinted but did not truly exploit the understanding that in the end it is Lauda that does not get it. just like schumacher was the height of boredom and Senna forever the heart of F1, so it was Lauda. Nobody cares about the times in racing. THeater is what matters. even a live F1 event is about the most boring thing imaginable, it needs characters, and clearly lauda has non (according to the film).",3,"Quite good, seems low budgety though,",1399248000,"05 5, 2014",2014,1210,"['liked', 'film', 'overall', 'who', 'care', 'one', 'only', 'two', 'hollywood', 'movies', 'know', 'where', 'germans', 'austrians', 'actually', 'speak', 'german', 'Lauda', 'still', 'TV', 'Germany', 'now', 'then', 'actor', 'had', 'plenty', 'practice', 'copying', 'way', 'lauda', 'sharp', 'point', 'real', 'life', 'made', 'quib', 'ass', 'being', 'able', 'feel', 'road', 'forces', 'being', 'key', 'Micheal', 'Schumacher.I', 'did', 'not', 'film', 'felt', 'small', 'times', 'use', 'lovations', 'tthe', 'formula', 'one', 'visits', 'nothing', 'daring', 'movie', 'last', 'world', 'had', 'left', 'tepid', 'movie', 'sex', 'scenes', 'slight', 'half', 'hearted', 'attempt', 'make', 'film', 'look', 'private', 'pictures', 'may', 'have', 'looked', 'era', 'however', 'not', 'much', 'attempt', 'make', 'era', 'come', 'alive.The', 'Film', 'hinted', 'did', 'not', 'truly', 'exploit', 'understanding', 'end', 'Lauda', 'not', 'get', 'just', 'schumacher', 'was', 'height', 'boredom', 'Senna', 'forever', 'heart', 'F1', 'was', 'Lauda', 'Nobody', 'times', 'racing', 'THeater', 'what', 'matters', 'even', 'live', 'F1', 'event', 'most', 'boring', 'thing', 'imaginable', 'characters', 'clearly', 'lauda', 'non', 'according', 'film']",Rush

In the end it comes down that every great champ needs a rivalry to motivate.  It also shows that just because you are an enemy on the track off the track you can still respect one another.  In fact my favorite scene is when Hunt hits the reporter who questions Lauda about how hideous he looks after his injury.  The two drivers that are the focus of this movie are polar opposites and that to me is what makes this movie so interesting.
