389493,A1JEFESGLIS076,6303925782,rsoonsa,"[9, 17]","This poorly made production features Clint Walker as Dan Baker, a homesteader in 1876 Utah who refuses to join a local vigilante organization, led by the town dry goods grocer (Alan Young), and the resultant effects his independent actions have upon his son Billy (Lee H. Montgomery). Ancillary plots involve Billy's nurturing of a wounded fledgling hawk, abandoned from the nest, and the boy's friendship with Mr. McGraw (Burl Ives), a recluse whose vocation is the preparation of damaged wildlife for their return to freedom. It is not possible to include a kind word about the direction, screenplay and editing, as all are at levels which might, at best, approach that of student-made cinema. The acting is wooden, due largely to the rambling script and weak direction, with Montgomery embarrassingly inept, and only Ives rises above his shrunken material, giving some meaning to his scenes. Although there is precious little to like about this film, the scenery is remarkably beautiful, as the production was located within two of Utah's National Forest regions.",1,WORTH A LOOK ONLY FOR BURL IVES.,1127260800,"09 21, 2005",2005,1066,"['poorly', 'made', 'production', 'features', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'Dan', 'Baker', 'homesteader', '1876', 'Utah', 'who', 'join', 'local', 'vigilante', 'organization', 'led', 'town', 'dry', 'goods', 'grocer', 'Alan', 'Young', 'resultant', 'effects', 'independent', 'actions', 'have', 'son', 'Billy', 'Lee', 'H.', 'Montgomery', 'Ancillary', 'plots', 'involve', 'Billy', 'nurturing', 'wounded', 'fledgling', 'hawk', 'abandoned', 'nest', 'boy', 'friendship', 'Mr.', 'McGraw', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'recluse', 'vocation', 'preparation', 'damaged', 'wildlife', 'return', 'freedom', 'not', 'possible', 'include', 'kind', 'word', 'direction', 'screenplay', 'editing', 'are', 'levels', 'might', 'best', 'approach', 'student-made', 'cinema', 'acting', 'wooden', 'due', 'largely', 'rambling', 'script', 'weak', 'direction', 'Montgomery', 'embarrassingly', 'inept', 'only', 'rises', 'shrunken', 'material', 'giving', 'meaning', 'scenes', 'precious', 'little', 'like', 'film', 'scenery', 'remarkably', 'beautiful', 'production', 'was', 'located', 'two', 'Utah', 'National', 'Forest', 'regions']",Baker's Hawk VHS

Parents of young children may wish to discuss this before the movie.Later there is another scene concerning vigilante justice which starts out as if it will become violent, but it defuses and is not violent in the end.The musical score is touching and appropriate; the outdoor filming is well done.Clint Walker gives an outstanding and believable performance as the boy'sfather.

389496,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,6303925782,William Timothy Lukeman,"[2, 2]","Young Billy Baker (Lee Montgomery)  finds an injured red-tailed hawk & reluctantly takes it to the supposed ""crazy man"" (Burl Ives) living at the top of the mountain. Of course, the ""crazy man"" turns out to be a wise, good-hearted recluse who finds better company among the animals he nurtures than among the townspeople below. And he has good reason -- due to worries about thefts & strangers in the area, the townspeople have formed a ""vigilance committee"" to maintain order, refusing to go to the local sheriff for help. While the founder of the group is merely scared & concerned, too many who join use it as a means for bullying & venting their own insecurities on anyone who's the least bit different.Billy's father Dan Baker (Clint Walker) is the one farmer who won't bend & join the group. As he advises his son Billy, once you decide that you're above the law, you can denounce & attack anyone you don't like, while masking it as ""public concern"" -- a sadly relevant message to this day. But the pressure from his neighbors eats away at him, and he takes it out on his son for ""wasting his time"" training the injured hawk & learning about a deeper communion with Nature from the kindly recluse.Matters come to a head when the vigilantes decide the ""crazy man"" has to be driven from his home. Why? They couldn't say themselves, except that he's different, and they accuse him of being ""so high & mighty"" -- the truth being that they can't bear their own feelings of helplessness, so they have to find a convenient scapegoat. Again, an all too timely message. Those who want to be left alone to just live their lives don't always get that chance, because their mere existence is seen as a threat by the frightened.Yes, this has the quality of an average but hardly outstanding made-for-TV movie, and the storyline feels a bit truncated at times. Diane Baker especially isn't given enough of a role as the boy's mother, although she brings real warmth & strength to her couple of brief scenes. But the bittersweet ending is an honest one, showing that while good people must stand up for decency, it doesn't always make everything all right, tied up neatly in a pretty bow. There's often a price for being a decent human being, and the mob does sometimes get away with its crimes. An excellent film for smaller children, with a strong ethical message & some difficult food for thought -- rather than simply preach, the film asks the young viewer to think about things afterward.Despite its weaknesses, which merit 3 stars at best for so-so filmmaking quality, I give it 4 stars because of its obvious but good lesson & for the sheer beauty of the hawk itself, magnificent in flight -- recommended!",4,"Simple, uneven,  but honest family film",1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,2703,"['Young', 'Billy', 'Baker', 'Lee', 'Montgomery', 'injured', 'red-tailed', 'hawk', 'reluctantly', 'supposed', 'crazy', 'man', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'living', 'top', 'mountain', 'course', 'crazy', 'man', 'out', 'be', 'wise', 'good-hearted', 'recluse', 'who', 'better', 'company', 'animals', 'townspeople', 'good', 'reason', 'due', 'worries', 'thefts', 'strangers', 'area', 'townspeople', 'have', 'formed', 'vigilance', 'committee', 'maintain', 'order', 'refusing', 'go', 'local', 'sheriff', 'help', 'founder', 'group', 'merely', 'scared', 'concerned', 'too', 'many', 'who', 'join', 'use', 'means', 'bullying', 'venting', 'own', 'insecurities', 'anyone', 'who', 'least', 'bit', 'different.Billy', 'father', 'Dan', 'Baker', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'one', 'farmer', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bend', 'join', 'group', 'son', 'Billy', 'once', 'decide', ""'re"", 'law', 'can', 'denounce', 'attack', 'anyone', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'masking', 'public', 'concern', 'sadly', 'relevant', 'message', 'day', 'pressure', 'neighbors', 'away', 'out', 'son', 'wasting', 'time', 'training', 'injured', 'hawk', 'learning', 'deeper', 'communion', 'Nature', 'kindly', 'recluse.Matters', 'come', 'head', 'when', 'vigilantes', 'decide', 'crazy', 'man', 'be', 'driven', 'home', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'say', 'different', 'accuse', 'being', 'so', 'high', 'mighty', 'truth', 'being', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'own', 'feelings', 'helplessness', 'have', 'find', 'convenient', 'scapegoat', 'Again', 'too', 'timely', 'message', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'just', 'live', 'lives', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'get', 'chance', 'mere', 'existence', 'seen', 'threat', 'frightened.Yes', 'quality', 'average', 'hardly', 'outstanding', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'storyline', 'bit', 'truncated', 'times', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'especially', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'role', 'boy', 'mother', 'real', 'warmth', 'strength', 'couple', 'brief', 'scenes', 'bittersweet', 'ending', 'honest', 'one', 'showing', 'good', 'people', 'must', 'stand', 'up', 'decency', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'everything', 'right', 'tied', 'up', 'neatly', 'pretty', 'bow', 'often', 'price', 'being', 'decent', 'human', 'being', 'mob', 'sometimes', 'get', 'away', 'crimes', 'excellent', 'film', 'smaller', 'children', 'strong', 'ethical', 'message', 'difficult', 'food', 'thought', 'rather', 'simply', 'preach', 'film', 'young', 'viewer', 'think', 'things', 'afterward.Despite', 'weaknesses', '3', 'stars', 'best', 'so-so', 'filmmaking', 'quality', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'obvious', 'good', 'lesson', 'sheer', 'beauty', 'hawk', 'magnificent', 'flight', 'recommended']",Baker's Hawk VHS
