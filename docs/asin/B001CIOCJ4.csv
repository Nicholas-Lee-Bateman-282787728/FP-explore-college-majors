At times, you can by the mean eyes or the way they talk.  A person mistreated will use a word or phrase they don't normally use, so that the tormenters understand why they got down on that level.  Everyone makes choices, and some turn out to be violent or hard.As usual, with Americans abroad, trouble abounds as they have to learn ""don't talk to strangers"" as many aren't who they say they are.  Some are wolves in sheep's clothing; bad guys are people who look innocent but are not.  Why do they always say ""I don't want to hurt you"" and then do it.  There were very few places to hide in barren Siberia, but we find ways to survive.  One solitary wolf was the least danger in this predictable movie.Locations change from the longest passenger train in the world to an antiquated yellow and green bus.  They used the ""fade in- fade out"" technique.  The gray horse with black spots was skittish as the train zoomed by..The seven days on the train turned out to be an adventure in fact.  Carlos arranged for one of the group to be separated in Russia.  It proved to be a photo opportunity for the headstrong wife and led to nasty torture in an underground chamber by the girlfriend.  The surprize attack by Carlos had fatal consequences as he'd accepty no compromise.  No one would take responsibility for his/her actions.Both women had fallen for the wrong man to trust.  Out of the darkness of despair as the bad happened, one took compassion.  When the two trains collided head on, the conclusion was evident.

1176499,A3I7YI4NMP6SV8,B001CIOCJ4,"B. Wells ""CineMan""","[1, 3]","Taking a cue from such Alfred Hitchcock classics as ""The Lady Vanishes"" and ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", writer/director Brad Anderson has fashioned an old-timey, atmospheric thriller involving an American couple traveling from Beijing to Moscow aboard the titular train.  Roy and Jessie have just completed an overseas mission with Roy's church, and are headed to Moscow in order to catch their flight back to America.  Once the train pulls out of Beijing, the pair are introduced to the mysterious, younger couple who will share their sleeping car: handsome Spaniard Carlos, and his childlike girlfriend, Abby.  As the train plows on through the snow-covered forests of Russia, Jessie becomes suspicious that their traveling companions are not what they seem.  When one of the quartet mysteriously disappears during a brief stopover at a Siberian outpost, friendship turns to uncertainty, discomfort to fear, as tensions between the the three others intensify.  Finally, a defensive gesture leads to an unexpected explosion of violence; events spiral out of control as unsavory connections are made and dangerous secrets come to light.  Things get even more complicated when Russian narcotics cop, Grinko, and his assistant, Kolzak, come onboard, lending an officious, yet somehow ambiguous air to the venture.  Are even the cops putting on an act?  Are they who they claim to be, or are they part of something more dangerous?  It's all very cloak and dagger, and while ""Transsiberian"" starts out promisingly, it becomes more ridiculous as it gets closer to the, admittedly, suspenseful climax.Anderson has done a decent job directing a flawed script that he co-wrote with Will Conroy.  But, while the script may be faulty and full of holes, it's never dull; Anderson keeps things happening at a brisk pace.  The cinematography is awesome, conveying a real feeling of increasing claustrophobia as the train's narrow corridors and tiny rooms seem to close in on the characters.  And the colorful, crowded train stations and towns are brought to vivid life in an exotic array of images and sounds; there's a terrific pungency to the scenes (and aboard the rail cars, as well) that almost allows you to smell the borscht and the boiling potatoes.The actors perform with varying degrees of success.  It was a little hard for me to believe that two people who were supposed to be, basically, part-time missionaries, would be smoking, drinking, and, otherwise, behaving in the distinctly un-Christian ways demonstrated by Jessie and Roy.  I wouldn't want my life to be in the hands of these two.  Still, Emily Mortimer, as Jessie, delivers one of the film's two believable performances.  She skillfully weaves frustration, passion, and mounting panic into a character whose actions become increasingly questionable as the film progresses.  As the naive, sweet Roy, Woody Harrelson seems to be channeling Jimmy Stewart at his most aw-shucks, All-American peak.  He's a bit too much of a virtuous goody-two shoes to ring true, and the callousness with which he urges Jessie to abandon a badly injured character towards the end, seems startlingly out of character.  The handsome Spanish actor, Eduardo Noriega, does a good job in portraying the predatory, sneaky Carlos; he's so smooth and good-looking that it's surprising (to him and to us) that he's still hanging out with the barely-out-of-her-teens, Abby.  Noriega lets us know that, beneath the charming veneer, lies a coiled snake waiting to strike; the extent of the snake's damage, however, is left somewhat ambiguous.  Is he really the monster that he is taken for, the instrument of his undoing?  Rounding out the quartet, Kate Mara (of ""Brokeback Mountain"" fame) is a little too subdued, a little too mysterious, as the worldly Abby.  She doesn't seem to have much personality, and is easily overwhelmed by the steamily gregarious Noriega in their scenes together.  Finally, playing the Russian cops, Ben Kingsley and Thomas Kretschmann don't bring anything new to their roles.  Written as cliched, one-dimensional figures, the roles don't require much from Kingsley and Kretschmann, allowing them to maintain their considerable dignity as they plow through their parts with professional solemnity.As far as dog-days-of-summer movies go, ""Transsiberian"" is far above most of what's out there now, but, all things considered, it's still far from a classic.  Too many implausibilities and loopholes derail ""Transsiberian"" before it reaches its final station, but it's still a scenic thrillride offering a chilliness that viewers may find welcome on a hot, summer afternoon with nothing much to do.",3,A Hitchcockian Derailment,1220140800,"08 31, 2008",2008,4650,"['Taking', 'cue', 'such', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'classics', 'Lady', 'Vanishes', 'Man', 'Who', 'Knew', 'Too', 'Much', 'writer/director', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'fashioned', 'old-timey', 'atmospheric', 'thriller', 'involving', 'American', 'couple', 'traveling', 'Beijing', 'Moscow', 'titular', 'train', 'Roy', 'Jessie', 'have', 'just', 'completed', 'overseas', 'mission', 'Roy', 'church', 'are', 'headed', 'Moscow', 'order', 'catch', 'flight', 'back', 'America', 'train', 'Beijing', 'pair', 'are', 'introduced', 'mysterious', 'younger', 'couple', 'who', 'will', 'share', 'sleeping', 'car', 'handsome', 'Spaniard', 'Carlos', 'childlike', 'girlfriend', 'Abby', 'train', 'plows', 'snow-covered', 'forests', 'Russia', 'Jessie', 'suspicious', 'traveling', 'companions', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'seem', 'When', 'one', 'quartet', 'mysteriously', 'brief', 'stopover', 'Siberian', 'outpost', 'friendship', 'turns', 'uncertainty', 'discomfort', 'fear', 'tensions', 'three', 'others', 'intensify', 'Finally', 'defensive', 'gesture', 'unexpected', 'explosion', 'violence', 'events', 'spiral', 'control', 'unsavory', 'connections', 'are', 'made', 'dangerous', 'secrets', 'come', 'light', 'Things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'Russian', 'narcotics', 'cop', 'Grinko', 'assistant', 'Kolzak', 'come', 'onboard', 'lending', 'officious', 'yet', 'somehow', 'ambiguous', 'air', 'venture', 'Are', 'even', 'cops', 'putting', 'act', 'Are', 'who', 'claim', 'be', 'are', 'part', 'something', 'more', 'dangerous', 'very', 'cloak', 'dagger', 'Transsiberian', 'out', 'promisingly', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'closer', 'admittedly', 'suspenseful', 'climax.Anderson', 'done', 'decent', 'job', 'directing', 'flawed', 'script', 'co-wrote', 'Will', 'Conroy', 'script', 'may', 'be', 'faulty', 'full', 'holes', 'never', 'dull', 'Anderson', 'things', 'happening', 'brisk', 'pace', 'cinematography', 'awesome', 'conveying', 'real', 'feeling', 'increasing', 'claustrophobia', 'train', 'narrow', 'corridors', 'tiny', 'rooms', 'seem', 'close', 'characters', 'colorful', 'crowded', 'train', 'stations', 'towns', 'are', 'brought', 'vivid', 'life', 'exotic', 'array', 'images', 'terrific', 'pungency', 'scenes', 'rail', 'cars', 'as', 'well', 'almost', 'smell', 'borscht', 'boiling', 'potatoes.The', 'actors', 'perform', 'varying', 'degrees', 'success', 'was', 'little', 'hard', 'believe', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'basically', 'part-time', 'missionaries', 'would', 'be', 'smoking', 'drinking', 'otherwise', 'behaving', 'distinctly', 'un-Christian', 'ways', 'demonstrated', 'Jessie', 'Roy', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'life', 'be', 'hands', 'two', 'Still', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Jessie', 'one', 'film', 'two', 'believable', 'performances', 'skillfully', 'frustration', 'passion', 'mounting', 'panic', 'character', 'actions', 'become', 'increasingly', 'questionable', 'film', 'naive', 'sweet', 'Roy', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'be', 'channeling', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'most', 'aw-shucks', 'All-American', 'peak', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'virtuous', 'goody-two', 'shoes', 'ring', 'true', 'callousness', 'Jessie', 'abandon', 'badly', 'injured', 'character', 'end', 'startlingly', 'character', 'handsome', 'Spanish', 'actor', 'Eduardo', 'Noriega', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'predatory', 'sneaky', 'Carlos', 'so', 'smooth', 'good-looking', 'surprising', 'still', 'hanging', 'out', 'barely-out-of-her-teens', 'Abby', 'Noriega', 'know', 'charming', 'veneer', 'coiled', 'snake', 'waiting', 'strike', 'extent', 'snake', 'damage', 'however', 'left', 'somewhat', 'ambiguous', 'really', 'monster', 'taken', 'instrument', 'undoing', 'Rounding', 'out', 'quartet', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'fame', 'little', 'too', 'subdued', 'little', 'too', 'mysterious', 'worldly', 'Abby', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'personality', 'easily', 'overwhelmed', 'steamily', 'gregarious', 'Noriega', 'scenes', 'together', 'Finally', 'playing', 'Russian', 'cops', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Thomas', 'Kretschmann', 'do', ""n't"", 'bring', 'anything', 'new', 'roles', 'Written', 'cliched', 'one-dimensional', 'figures', 'roles', 'do', ""n't"", 'require', 'much', 'Kingsley', 'Kretschmann', 'allowing', 'maintain', 'considerable', 'dignity', 'plow', 'parts', 'professional', 'solemnity.As', 'far', 'dog-days-of-summer', 'movies', 'go', 'Transsiberian', 'far', 'most', 'what', 'out', 'there', 'now', 'things', 'considered', 'still', 'far', 'classic', 'Too', 'many', 'implausibilities', 'loopholes', 'derail', 'Transsiberian', 'final', 'station', 'still', 'scenic', 'thrillride', 'offering', 'chilliness', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'welcome', 'hot', 'summer', 'afternoon', 'nothing', 'much', 'do']",N/A
1176500,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B001CIOCJ4,Caleb Williams,"[0, 0]","This is a film that upon going into it, I knew absolutely nothing about it other than a few chinese whispers about how good it was. The cast for such a little known film on the world wide scale is absolutely shocking as it contains genuine legends in Woody Harrelson and Ben Kingsley. Also some relatively unknown names to me such as Kate Mara and Emily Mortimer, but they come to this film with their shocking beauty and captivating acting ability.The film is primarily based around Roy & Jessie (Harrelson & Mortimer) who after a volunteer stint in China decide to take the Trans-Siberia express train to Moscow thanks to Roys love of trains. They both end up with two fellow travellers Carlos & Abby (Eduardo Noriega & Kate Mara) who aren't what they seem and open up some dark parts of Jessies past and create some more troubles for her that she could have hoped. During the journey, Roy is left behind at a station forcing Jessie to get to know Carlos a little bit more which leads into a bit of a tragic affair.One thing I will always be prepared to praise this film for is its setting, the country of Russia is such a beautiful place and although it may have a dark underworld ""Transsiberia"" manages to capture both the breathtaking beauty of the nation and the cruel situation of some of its natives. The aerial views of the train travelling through the snowy landscape are something to be witnessed, and I sincerely can't imagine how stunning it would be to see such a landscape in person but there's no doubting the film captured it perfectly.The acting has to be seen to be believed also (of course) as each and every actor plays their part perfectly. Woody Harrelson's character is the gullible Christian do-gooder who only wants to make his girlfriend happy. Jessie, Emily Mortimers character is possibly the more complex of the entire group as she has a bit of a dark past and thanks to Roy, may not have been alive at the point of this film. Throughout you see Emily reveal that dark side thanks to the manipulative influences of Carlos played by Eduardo Noriega. The character of Carlos is possibly the more shallow and predictable of the group and in a way, you become aware of what his true intentions are from the get go. The staggering beauty of Kate Mara also deserves a mention, but her acting unfortunately wasn't used to its full potential as it was a film focusing mainly around the three prior protagonists.Just when you think you have the film worked out, it shoots off in a completely new and intriguing direction. I found myself starting off thinking ""oh this is going to be a bang bang, trigger happy action flick."" Then I found myself thinking about half way through ""oh it's a movie about self discovery and personal identity."" No it wasn't that either and that is one of the main selling points of the entire picture, you simply don't know where it's going to end up. Ben Kingsley does play a bigger part than you originally think which is quite enlightening in some respects as I always enjoy his work.This is a wonderful film that I know can easily be enjoyed by anyone and everyone. It isn't a family film by any respects, but is certainly one that can be enjoyed thoroughly by the adults in any family.",5,Fantastic,1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,3239,"['film', 'going', 'knew', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'other', 'few', 'chinese', 'whispers', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'cast', 'little', 'known', 'film', 'world', 'wide', 'scale', 'absolutely', 'shocking', 'genuine', 'legends', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Also', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'names', 'such', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'come', 'film', 'shocking', 'beauty', 'captivating', 'acting', 'ability.The', 'film', 'primarily', 'based', 'Roy', 'Jessie', 'Harrelson', 'Mortimer', 'who', 'volunteer', 'stint', 'China', 'decide', 'take', 'Trans-Siberia', 'express', 'train', 'Moscow', 'thanks', 'Roys', 'love', 'trains', 'end', 'up', 'two', 'fellow', 'travellers', 'Carlos', 'Abby', 'Eduardo', 'Noriega', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', 'seem', 'open', 'up', 'dark', 'parts', 'Jessies', 'past', 'create', 'more', 'troubles', 'could', 'have', 'hoped', 'journey', 'Roy', 'left', 'behind', 'station', 'forcing', 'Jessie', 'get', 'know', 'Carlos', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'bit', 'tragic', 'affair.One', 'thing', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'prepared', 'praise', 'film', 'setting', 'country', 'Russia', 'such', 'beautiful', 'place', 'may', 'have', 'dark', 'underworld', 'Transsiberia', 'capture', 'breathtaking', 'beauty', 'nation', 'cruel', 'situation', 'natives', 'aerial', 'views', 'train', 'travelling', 'snowy', 'landscape', 'are', 'something', 'be', 'witnessed', 'sincerely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'stunning', 'would', 'be', 'see', 'such', 'landscape', 'person', 'doubting', 'film', 'captured', 'perfectly.The', 'acting', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'also', 'course', 'actor', 'part', 'perfectly', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'character', 'gullible', 'Christian', 'do-gooder', 'who', 'only', 'make', 'girlfriend', 'happy', 'Jessie', 'Emily', 'Mortimers', 'character', 'possibly', 'more', 'complex', 'entire', 'group', 'bit', 'dark', 'past', 'thanks', 'Roy', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'alive', 'point', 'film', 'see', 'Emily', 'reveal', 'dark', 'side', 'thanks', 'manipulative', 'influences', 'Carlos', 'played', 'Eduardo', 'Noriega', 'character', 'Carlos', 'possibly', 'more', 'shallow', 'predictable', 'group', 'way', 'become', 'aware', 'what', 'true', 'intentions', 'are', 'get', 'go', 'staggering', 'beauty', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'also', 'mention', 'acting', 'unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'used', 'full', 'potential', 'was', 'film', 'focusing', 'mainly', 'three', 'prior', 'protagonists.Just', 'when', 'think', 'have', 'film', 'worked', 'out', 'shoots', 'off', 'completely', 'new', 'intriguing', 'direction', 'found', 'starting', 'off', 'thinking', 'going', 'be', 'bang', 'bang', 'trigger', 'happy', 'action', 'flick', 'Then', 'found', 'thinking', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'self', 'discovery', 'personal', 'identity', 'No', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'main', 'selling', 'points', 'entire', 'picture', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'play', 'bigger', 'part', 'originally', 'think', 'quite', 'enlightening', 'respects', 'always', 'enjoy', 'work.This', 'wonderful', 'film', 'know', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'anyone', 'everyone', ""n't"", 'family', 'film', 'respects', 'certainly', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly', 'adults', 'family']",N/A

1176504,A3PP64HMEYIGF0,B001CIOCJ4,CastleD,"[2, 4]","Two things save Transsiberian: Emily Mortimer and Ben Kingsley. Emily is a great actress (and underrated), and she does her best with this clumsy screenplay making otherwise awkward scenes engaging. She has a very expressive face that conveys subtlety and emotions well without dialogue. This gives her a strong and immensely entertaining screen presence. In other words, she's just a pleasure to watch.Ben Kingsley it goes without saying is a good actor no matter what part you throw him in. Here his character is ambiguous and he does well keeping you guessing about his motivations and intentions.The big problem besides the predictable story that goes basically nowhere, is Woody Harrelson's character. He's a stereotypical doof. An oblivious goofball touristy type who has no idea what's happening right in front of his face. Emily (Woody's wife) accidentally gets caught up with shady characters on a trans siberian train, and idiot Woody is so out of it he has no clue. Sometimes she'll have a terrified look on her face, like she just saw five ghosts, and he'll be like:""Dur are you okay honey?""""Uh (breathing heavy and looking scared), yeah um I'm fine.""""Oh ok honey dur, hey wanna go walk around town hur hur!""He doesn't notice the look on her face, that people are after her and want to kill her? That the director and nobody else on the set notices these glaring mistakes is unacceptable. It's hard to take a movie seriously after that.

DeRiemer,"[5, 7]","What could be a greater adventure for a young American couple with the husband a train buff than undertaking the Trans-Siberian seven-night rail journey from Beijing to Moscow in the winter? And what could be more foreboding than, if you're Jessie (Emily Mortimer), realizing Roy (Woody Harrelson) didn't get back on board at one stop. She has to get off at the next isolated little town, not knowing the language, faced with not unfriendly but hardly sympathetic people at the station. It's a situation that makes us almost as anxious as Jessie. Thank goodness Jessie and Roy made friends with the couple who were assigned their tiny four-bed compartment. Carlos (Eduardo Noriega) is in his mid-thirties, Spanish, smooth and a bit of an operator. He admires handsome women, and Jessie is more than handsome. His companion is Abby (Kate Mara), a 20-year-old American drifter who is good-looking and a bit sullen. When Carlos and Jessie are alone, he shows Jessie the bag full of matrushkas, those hand-painted dolls within dolls he sometimes smuggles across borders. Carlos and Abby wouldn't think of leaving Jessie by herself in the middle of a Russian winter when it's 27 below, to await the next day's train that might bring her husband. They announce they'll stay with her. She's grateful. We're saying, ""Uh oh, what's going on?""Did I mention? The movie starts with a dead man frozen in a chair, a knife in his back, and a lot of missing heroin. Russian detective Grinko (Ben Kingsley) needs to find this fortune in white powder. He'll have to be clever; that white power can be mixed with chemicals and molded into all sorts of shapes. We'll later meet him on the train. It seems the Trans-Siberian has become a favorite method for Russian drug kingpins, using human mules, to transport their goods across the country.Jessie and Roy are finally reunited at the station where Jessie has been waiting, but not before she and Carlos took a bus ride and a long snowy hike to see a deserted Russian church. Carlos was sure she'd like it since Jessie is a photo bug. Then something happens there that changes the movie from a story of foreboding, with lots of reasons to feel that way, to an outright thriller filled with lies, torture, unexpected courage and, to be truthful, unexpected ruthlessness. It's the old death on the moving train tale, and it works again. The movie is done well.The five main characters are all fine, except that Woody Harrelson's performance can quickly get tiresome. He plays Roy as a chirpy, open-faced, do-the-right-thing husband who back home is active in his church and owns a hardware store. Roy is a man who deeply loves his wife but doesn't understand her all that well. Harrelson, I think, is a good actor and getting better. I hope his performance was something the director insisted on. The two standouts are Emily Mortimer and Ben Kingsley. Mortimer's Jessie is a complex woman. She'd been down and out with booze and drugs when she met Roy. He believed in her and she brought herself back up. He loves her and she's now straight and clean. She loves him, but there's still of glint of attraction for a wild experience or two. It's Jessie's decisions and actions that drive most of the movie. Mortimer is first-rate. Kingsley plays a tired, cool, resentful cop who can recall the old Communist days when a policeman like him went first-class. He's seen it all. As for what happens to whom and how -- there's a bit of gruesome knife torture at one point and a nifty train crash -- see or rent the movie.Emily Mortimer is such an intelligent actor it's a pleasure to watch her at work. She's the daughter of John Mortimer, so perhaps brains and style can be inherited. I like her a lot in the Midsomer Murders episode, The Killings at Badger's Drift, as Nina Blount inBright Young Thingsand as Cathie inYoung Adam. As for Kingsley, you need look no further thanSexy Beastto see him at his worst andDaveto see him at his nicest.One of the attractions for me of Transsiberian is a look at the train, the sleeping compartments, the dining car, the types of passengers. the attendants. The movie was shot in Vilnius but I assume a good deal of effort was involved to make the train journey look authentic. All I know is that I'd take the Trans-Siberian in a minute. For those who like to dream about rail journeys, like me, google seat61 trains. You'll find a website run by a man who loves train travel. There's lots of information about the Trans-Siberian trains and routes.",4,"For those who love train journeys...mixed with anxiety, suspense, suspicion and torture.

1176508,A12RMAJXRPQWTY,B001CIOCJ4,C.Wallace,"[0, 0]","The central character is Jessie, brilliantly portrayed by Emily Mortimer. Jessie is married to Woody Harrelson's character, Roy. Harrelson deftly projects Roy's image: naive, eternally optimistic, and bland. Jessie seems a little unhappy with Roy; she's unfulfilled, looking for more.It was Roy's bright idea to take the Trans-Siberian Express from Beijing to Moscow after he and Jessie completed a mission in China for their hometown church. Roy views this mission and the exotic train trip mainly as ways to add some spice to the relationship. Plus, he's got a model train in his basement way back in Iowa.Enter a couple of strangers in their crowded sleeping compartment (two bunk beds) on the train: Carlos (Eduardo Noriega) and his girlfriend Abby (Kate Mara). Carlos is somewhat younger than Roy and much bolder; Abby is only twenty and seems to be the victim of Carlos's sleazy, manipulative nature.Carlos immediately hits on Jessie. Jessie rejects him, but leaves the door open more than a crack. Carlos does not need much of a hint; he aggressively pursues Jessie. He becomes the wolf and she the lamb.A key reason trains lost out to airplanes is speed. But with a train, of course, one has more time to interact with passengers and get a good thriller going. Also, trains can stop in quaint little towns along the way so a couple can romp about.It was actually filmed in Lithuania, frigid enough in the winter.The cinematography is top-notch, particularly the shots in and around the ruins of an Orthodox church. The camera also captures a still backwards post-Soviet Russia. The toilets and windows don't work on the train; there are boorish officials about. There are bus rides (yes, trains and buses) that seem like something out of the 1950s.To say much more about the plot might spoil it. The first third of the movie seems to be a wintry soap opera with a lot of chatting as the train gently rocks about. But this builds to a pivotal event that turns everything upside down. The somewhat tedious beginning makes a lot of sense in light of future developments.At first I was disappointed with the final resolution of the relationship between Jessie and Abby. But I thought back about the earlier interplay between the two, and found the ending more acceptable.In sum,it's a good film with more than enough to justify the five stars.",5,Bring Your Mittens,1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,2347,"['central', 'character', 'Jessie', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Jessie', 'married', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'character', 'Roy', 'Harrelson', 'deftly', 'projects', 'Roy', 'image', 'naive', 'eternally', 'optimistic', 'bland', 'Jessie', 'little', 'unhappy', 'Roy', 'unfulfilled', 'looking', 'more.It', 'was', 'Roy', 'bright', 'idea', 'take', 'Trans-Siberian', 'Express', 'Beijing', 'Moscow', 'Jessie', 'completed', 'mission', 'China', 'hometown', 'church', 'Roy', 'mission', 'exotic', 'train', 'trip', 'mainly', 'as', 'ways', 'add', 'spice', 'relationship', 'got', 'model', 'train', 'basement', 'way', 'back', 'Iowa.Enter', 'couple', 'strangers', 'crowded', 'sleeping', 'compartment', 'two', 'bunk', 'beds', 'train', 'Carlos', 'Eduardo', 'Noriega', 'girlfriend', 'Abby', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'Carlos', 'somewhat', 'younger', 'Roy', 'much', 'bolder', 'Abby', 'only', 'twenty', 'be', 'victim', 'Carlos', 'sleazy', 'manipulative', 'nature.Carlos', 'immediately', 'Jessie', 'Jessie', 'door', 'more', 'crack', 'Carlos', 'not', 'need', 'much', 'hint', 'aggressively', 'Jessie', 'wolf', 'lamb.A', 'key', 'reason', 'trains', 'lost', 'out', 'airplanes', 'speed', 'train', 'course', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'interact', 'passengers', 'get', 'good', 'thriller', 'going', 'Also', 'trains', 'can', 'stop', 'quaint', 'little', 'towns', 'way', 'couple', 'can', 'romp', 'about.It', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'Lithuania', 'frigid', 'enough', 'winter.The', 'cinematography', 'top-notch', 'particularly', 'shots', 'ruins', 'Orthodox', 'church', 'camera', 'also', 'still', 'post-Soviet', 'Russia', 'toilets', 'windows', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'train', 'are', 'boorish', 'officials', 'are', 'bus', 'rides', 'yes', 'trains', 'buses', 'seem', 'something', '1950s.To', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'might', 'spoil', 'first', 'third', 'movie', 'be', 'wintry', 'soap', 'opera', 'lot', 'chatting', 'train', 'gently', 'pivotal', 'event', 'everything', 'upside', 'down', 'somewhat', 'tedious', 'beginning', 'lot', 'sense', 'light', 'future', 'developments.At', 'first', 'was', 'disappointed', 'final', 'resolution', 'relationship', 'Jessie', 'Abby', 'thought', 'back', 'earlier', 'interplay', 'two', 'found', 'ending', 'more', 'acceptable.In', 'sum', 'good', 'film', 'more', 'enough', 'justify', 'five', 'stars']",N/A

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 1]","A less than likable American couple, having just finished missionary work in China (two of the most unlikely missionaries imaginable), have decided to ""treat"" themselves to an extended vacation by crossing Russia before their flight back to the states via the TRANSSIBERIAN.  (Just the phrase itself conjures up gender confusion, but I digress.)  While traveling across a very cold, white, yet beautiful Mother Russia wilderness--in cramped quarters, with less than reliable facilities, and very surly train staff--this couple finds itself entangled in first a murder, then a struggle with corrupt Russian police over a shipment of heroin.  The ending is Hollywood lame and over the top, but until we get there TRANSSIBERIAN furnishes icy suspense in spades--especially when delivered by a thickly-accented Ben Kingsley, playing a less than admirable law enforcement officer.Just thinking about Woody Harrelson annoys me, while there's not an instrument in existence that can measure my indifference to Emily Mortimer, yet I must say this pair does a decent job playing an incompatible couple dealing with more than their fair share of. . .stress.  But the actors who ultimately carry this film are Kingsley, who is totally believable as a corrupt cop working for the mob, and Thomas Kretschmann as Kingsley's scowling, menacing deputy.  You don't want to get on either's bad side, believe me.  I thoroughly enjoy how the story, character development, and plot are patiently set up before the real suspense begins, culminating in a sense of panic and urgency--before the nuttiness of the ending.

1176510,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B001CIOCJ4,Doug Anderson,"[46, 61]","This one grabbed my attention when I read about it in the New York Times last month. The article made it sound like it might rival Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train or Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express. Well it doesn't. Not even close. Granted it does feature exotic Transsiberian locales from Beijing to Moscow, a train ride full of mystery and suspense, and the work of a set of top-notch actors. Unfortunately, everything that is attractive about this film is derailed by a script that takes one too many unlikely plot turns. So, instead of getting a suspense filled Strangers on a Train or an elegantly paced Murder on the Orient Express, we get just another Hostel or Turistas.In the beginning there is the thrill that one is about to embark on an exotic journey into an area for the most part uncharted by Hollywood (Siberia), and the film does deliver a few glimpses of China and Russia that entice the eye. And, at first anyway, the characters and their relationships are intriguing enough to grab and hold our attention. Woody Harrelson is always good and here he delivers a fairly convincing performance as ""Roy"", a christian volunteer doing work with needy children in China. Roy is the typical bleary-eyed American optimist blissfully unaware of his own naivete. The fact that he wears Woodrow Wilson styled bifocals nicely underscores his limited vision of the world. This isn't Oscar stuff by any stretch but naivete is Woody's forte and since this character truly is caring and compassionate and sees only the best in other people he's actually quite likable. Since everyone else in this film is slightly jaded and gaurded and hiding a sketchy past, Roy's optimism and openness and childlike enthusiasm for trains is actually quite refreshing. His openness is at times an asset (he is a people magnet), at other times a liability (his naivete and over-the-top Americanness make him an easy target at home and abroad).Accompanying Roy on this volunteer trip to China is his wife Jessie (played by the immensely talented and infinitely watchable Emily Mortimer whose previous film appearances include: Match Point, Lars and the Real Girl & Lovely and Amazing). Jessie is an odd match for Roy. She has experienced more of the world than he has and her adventurous, and perhaps dark, past is something that she keeps to herself. That is until Roy and Jessie board the Transsiberian Express and meet fellow travelers Carlos (Eduardo Noriega, best known for his work in the Spanish film  Open Your Eyes) and Abby (Kate Mara). Carlos and Abby are seasoned travelers who look like they have seen a lot of the world, and not just the stuff that's in the Lonely Planet travel guide. Though well traveled, they are younger than Roy and Jessie and still full of wanderlust for the world and each other. Being around them reawakens Jessie's own still simmering wanderlust. Reckless and impulsive Carlos awakens her sense of danger and her sensuality (which have remained for the most part dormant during her time with Roy); and unrooted and uncertain Abby reminds her of her own younger and riskier, and as yet unmapped, self. Abby represents that side of herself that Jessie misses but also fears so she feels threatened by but also protective of Abby who is traveling down a lot of the same paths and traveling down them for many of the same reasons that Jessie formerly did. Abby's attraction to Carlos reminds Jessie of her own attractions to such men  when she was that age and therefore she has conflicting feelings for Carlos: her younger self wants him, her older self wants him out of the picture. The fact that Jessie has a past and an understanding of many different types of existence makes her an excellent observer of human nature and as a result she takes wonderful pictures. But this avocation, like her relationship with Roy, is also a safe one. It allows her to indulge her interest in the disordered variety of life that she is attracted to but also to maintain a responsible and respectable distance from that world. However, her pictures also provide clues to an undeniable truth about Jessie. In the most memorable scene of the film a detective handles her camera and begins to scan through her photos while she nervously watches knowing the difference between culpability and liberty is only one delete button away. Mortimer does an exceptional job with the role. This character is full of surprises, including self-surprise, every step of the way.The film could have worked well had it confined itself to developing the personal histories and tracing the evolving relationship dynamics and life trajectories of these four characters as they travel together in close quarters on an exotic train passing through one snowy Siberian locale after another. Instead, the film decides to take a different route and heads off into the usual Hollywood thriller terrain: drug smuggling, torture, murder, trainjacking & smashing etc... In other words, at about the halfway point, the film foregoes character study (and subtlety), and becomes your usual lurid, predictable, and forgettable summer flick.",3,Solid Casting and Characters

During their week-long ride on the tracks of the Trans Siberian Railway, they quickly fall in with some shady characters and methodically dig themselves into a deep, dark hole. Harrelson is over-optimistic, single minded and simple, like a railroad obsessed slant on his character from Cheers, while Mortimer's guarded introvert tries to relive her rebellious younger years via a series of increasingly forehead-smacking decisions. Those missteps effectively fuel the plot, though, and quietly build to a hectic, frightening climax amidst the desolate Russian snow drifts.

It is an examination of the nature of fidelity, truth and gullibility...with a healthy dose of dont talk to strangers thrown in. Roy (Woody Harrelson) and Jessie (Emily Mortimer) have been in the Far East, where Jessie's prowess with a camera has won her honors in helping the plight of children in China. The couple decides to take the long Transsiberian train back to Moscow, eager to see more of the culture of the area. Roy, who back home is an important member of his church and a hardware store owner, as well as a train buff, comes off as highly likeable, sweet, and a little too innocent for his own good. Woody Harrelson plays this type of role well, and is good here. His wife Jessie is a rescued 'bad girl', struggling even now to settle down and not pine for her days of less-than-innocent. They board the train and find themselves co-cabined with a mysterious young couple who even at the outset Jessie is not sure are all they seem.Carlos (Eduardo Noriega) and Abby (Kate Mara) are hinky from the start, jumpy, a little creepy; and Carlos shows immediate interest in Jessie, which Roy doesn't get and which makes Jessie nervous. Everything comes to a head when, at a station stop, Roy gets left behind. There is so much suggestion in this movie, you are not sure exactly what to think about the fact that he isn't on the train when it starts up again; and you are kept guessing about this, and practically everything else in the movie. Jessie opts to stay at the next stop and wait for Roy to rejoin the train, and Carlos and Abby decide to stay with her, which doesn't exactly make her feel more secure.The action grows darker and more grim from here, becoming a tangled web of deception, danger, and that impotent desperate feeling of being a foreigner in a place where the rules aren't clear. Everyone in the cast is spot-on; you really believe the fear and dread in Jessie when things transpire that she sees no way out of; you know Inspector Grinko (the always superb Sir Ben Kingsley, doing a great Russian accent here as a corrupt police official) is sizing things up with a glance. Roy slowly comes out of his cloud of sunny complacency to realize that there are things going on that perhaps a smile cannot fix, and that his wife is up to her neck in big problems.I chanced upon this film, and was riveted from the first moment. You can feel the cold of the Siberian winter, and the helplessness of being a total stranger on a train full of native speakers who aren't always that interested in being polite or helpful. There was not a dull moment in the film, and the action was enhanced by a nuanced score that sends chills down your back at all the right times. Although I felt the ending a bit contrived and improbable, I would recommend this movie completely.

1176515,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B001CIOCJ4,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[10, 11]","** Spoilers aheadFor the most part, Transsiberian works as a suspense/thriller and captures the uncomfortable feeling of being a foreigner in another land. The director Brad Anderson does a commendable job setting up the relationship between the couple, their struggles, and their vastly different personalities. He also sets the stage for quite a finish, but the viewer will have to decide how well this is pulled off. I loved the scenery and much of the dialogue was satisfactory throughout. A slow, definitive build up to the main conflict is sorely lacking in contemporary films, but Transsiberian captures this. The basic premise is that an American couple, Roy and Jessie are (Woody Harrelson, Emily Mortimer) taking a trip home from China on the Trans-Siberian Express become involved in a plot involving an investigation of drug possession and an accidental murder. When Roy and Jessie happen to meet and share a cabin with another couple (Carlos, Abby) from the West, events begin to pick up, and the intrigue begins. The seemingly well-meaning couple has other plans and, after a mix-up where Roy and Jessie become separated, it sheds a bit of light on what is going on. Later, a Russian police officer (Sir Ben Kingsley) takes over the investigation, but his true intentions are a bit shady.While most of the film was solid, there were some aspects of the film that irked me.  For one, being that Jessie (Mortimer) was the strongest character, I found it appalling and puzzling how she could not and would not tell the truth at ANY costs (which included possibly having her husband shot to death and one of the characters who she befriended, Abby, tortured). Not only that, but she has no qualms about going ""out in the middle of nowhere"" with a mysterious man at the same time her husband is missing. Was this just a major character flaw for her, or what was the deal? It seemed a little inconsistent with who she is. You would think that she might finally see the light, but no, it never happens. Another point that seemed a little inconsistent or baffling was when Roy and Jessie basically flee their captors but leave Abby, after being tortured and beaten and pleading for help, to the wolves. Were these the same good people who were doing missionary work in China? The last part of the film, the unraveling of events, kind of fell flat, and seemed to ""sell out"" a little, going Hollywood, and having the typical good guy/ bad guy struggle scenario play out. It didn't really live up to the carefully crafted suspense in the first part. Also, there were questions that were not fully explored. (i. e. Why did Roy miss his train? ). It didn't compare to the first part of the film that took time to build up suspense, and give some intrigue to the tale.Still, Transsiberian works on many levels. The tension when Kingsley's character is questioning Jessie about the missing man really adds to the mood and confusion of the nave American couple. In short, this is an above-average suspense with mostly solid performances and an intriguing plot. This film does have a ""feel"" of Hitchcock to it at times, but it's best to leave the comparisons at the door.",4,"Intriguing thriller from Anderson, major spoilers ahead",1292803200,"12 20, 2010",2010,3168,"['**', 'Spoilers', 'aheadFor', 'most', 'part', 'Transsiberian', 'suspense/thriller', 'uncomfortable', 'feeling', 'being', 'foreigner', 'land', 'director', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'commendable', 'job', 'setting', 'up', 'relationship', 'couple', 'struggles', 'vastly', 'different', 'personalities', 'also', 'stage', 'quite', 'finish', 'viewer', 'will', 'have', 'decide', 'how', 'well', 'pulled', 'off', 'loved', 'scenery', 'much', 'dialogue', 'was', 'satisfactory', 'slow', 'definitive', 'build', 'up', 'main', 'conflict', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'contemporary', 'films', 'Transsiberian', 'captures', 'basic', 'premise', 'American', 'couple', 'Roy', 'Jessie', 'are', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'taking', 'trip', 'home', 'China', 'Trans-Siberian', 'Express', 'become', 'involved', 'plot', 'involving', 'investigation', 'drug', 'possession', 'accidental', 'murder', 'When', 'Roy', 'Jessie', 'happen', 'meet', 'share', 'cabin', 'couple', 'Carlos', 'Abby', 'West', 'events', 'begin', 'pick', 'up', 'intrigue', 'seemingly', 'well-meaning', 'couple', 'other', 'plans', 'mix-up', 'where', 'Roy', 'Jessie', 'become', 'separated', 'bit', 'light', 'what', 'going', 'Later', 'Russian', 'police', 'officer', 'Sir', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'investigation', 'true', 'intentions', 'are', 'bit', 'shady.While', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'solid', 'were', 'aspects', 'film', 'irked', 'one', 'being', 'Jessie', 'Mortimer', 'was', 'strongest', 'character', 'found', 'appalling', 'puzzling', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'would', 'not', 'tell', 'truth', 'ANY', 'costs', 'included', 'possibly', 'having', 'husband', 'shot', 'death', 'one', 'characters', 'who', 'befriended', 'Abby', 'tortured', 'Not', 'only', 'qualms', 'going', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'mysterious', 'man', 'same', 'time', 'husband', 'missing', 'Was', 'just', 'major', 'character', 'flaw', 'was', 'deal', 'seemed', 'little', 'inconsistent', 'who', 'would', 'think', 'might', 'finally', 'see', 'light', 'never', 'point', 'seemed', 'little', 'inconsistent', 'baffling', 'was', 'when', 'Roy', 'Jessie', 'basically', 'flee', 'captors', 'leave', 'Abby', 'being', 'tortured', 'beaten', 'pleading', 'help', 'wolves', 'Were', 'same', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'doing', 'missionary', 'work', 'China', 'last', 'part', 'film', 'unraveling', 'events', 'kind', 'fell', 'flat', 'seemed', 'sell', 'out', 'little', 'going', 'Hollywood', 'having', 'typical', 'good', 'guy/', 'bad', 'guy', 'struggle', 'scenario', 'play', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'live', 'up', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'suspense', 'first', 'part', 'Also', 'were', 'questions', 'were', 'not', 'fully', 'explored', 'i.', 'e.', 'Why', 'did', 'Roy', 'miss', 'train', 'did', ""n't"", 'compare', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'took', 'time', 'build', 'up', 'suspense', 'give', 'intrigue', 'tale.Still', 'Transsiberian', 'works', 'many', 'levels', 'tension', 'when', 'Kingsley', 'character', 'questioning', 'Jessie', 'missing', 'man', 'really', 'mood', 'confusion', 'nave', 'American', 'couple', 'short', 'above-average', 'suspense', 'mostly', 'solid', 'performances', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'film', 'have', 'feel', 'Hitchcock', 'times', 'best', 'leave', 'comparisons', 'door']",N/A

1176517,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B001CIOCJ4,General Zombie,"[1, 1]","Brad Anderson has been flitting around the edges of mainstream success for a decade now, notably in horror-pic ""Session 9"" and the surreal Christian Bale vehicle ""The Machinist."" ""Transsiberian"" is Anderson's third thriller, a film which should have elevated him towards the major ranks of film directors. While Anderson's directorial abilities have been in evidence for sometime, only now has he begun with a first-rate script. The screenplay, by Anderson and Will Conroy, is a true rarity in modern cinema: a slow-burning, legitimately Hitchcockian and often unpredictable suspense narrative. Indeed, the film is perhaps too slow moving for most mainstream audiences, with almost 45 minutes of pure exposition. Nevertheless, those who stick around will be treated to a staggering turn of events that generate enormous suspense from the previously somewhat mundane scenario. On second viewing the film reveals certain flaws, particularly some slightly overheated characterizations and a clinically, improbably clean screenplay. Nevertheless, my first viewing was truly gripping, and these small flaws do little to diminish the film's status as one of the finest thrillers in recent memory.Like many of Hitchcock's more famed thrillers, ""Transsiberian"" takes care to establish a complete world before ratcheting up the suspense. The film centers on Roy (Woody Harrelson) and Jessie (Emily Mortimer), an American couple traveling on the trans-Siberian railroad after completing charitable work in Beijing. Roy is a good-natured and almost comically square Christian and train fanatic. Jessie seems almost equally open and genuine, though we soon learn that she has a rather colorful, drug-related past. They meet Carlos (Eduardo Noriega), the embodiment of the dark, mysterious European and his much younger American companion Abby (Kate Mara), a reserved, nervous girl who hides behind her coal-black eyeliner and wraps herself in her hoodie at all times. They soon become friends, even though Carlos displays an obvious attraction to Emily and proves to be a shifty and possibly untrustworthy individual. Troubles first arise when Roy mysteriously disappears, apparently left behind, and Carlos's overtures become more overt. These developments culminate in a truly surprising scene too significant to reveal here after which Jessie separates from Abby and Carlos and returns to the train to be reunited with Roy, who simply missed the train after all. Jessie, however, discovers a hidden load of heroin planted in her luggage just in time to meet Grinko (Ben Kingsley), a friendly but nosy Russian narcotics detective who has questions regarding Carlos and Abby.The second half of ""Transsiberian"" centers on another prominent Hitchockian conceit, the innocent falsely accused and suddenly thrust into a nightmarish situation. The early scenes after Jessie returns to the train are almost unbearably intense, and I couldn't help but share Jessie's terror that the drugs will be discovered. (I can remember few other situations where I've been so worried for a film character.) Any discussion of the film is hamstrung by the need to avoid spoilers, as the film hinges on major twists, but ""Transsiberian"" has a subtle edge too, displayed in the layered, quiet conversations between Grinko and Jessie, where both are aware that the other knows far more than they will admit to. Though the story is impressively elaborate and often surprising, it could've stood to be a bit smaller, particularly towards the end. (It also grows more predictable as it moves along, but this is an inevitability.) I do not object that the final act degenerates into conventional thriller violence, but these scenes could've been less grandiose and more plausible. Similarly, the final twist is perhaps one twist too many, coming off as one last manipulation, rather than a natural extension of the story. (It's mere denouement, though, and does little to impact the film as a whole.)Though the twisting plot draws most of your attention, Anderson's directorial abilities have not diminished, and the other elements are strong. Trains are an ideal, utterly claustrophobic setting for thrillers, and Anderson uses this element to the hilt while still contrasting it with the snowy, endless expanse of the Russian wilderness. (Not only is the train a suffocating prison, Jessie has nowhere to go even if she could escape.) Anderson also recreates the Hollywood vision of Russia, filled with gruff, often-isolated individuals, most notably the bundled, unsmiling old women who stare blankly at nothing in particular. Equally significant, the film displays a surprising human element. Mortimer's Jessie is a legitimately likable protagonist, and Roy proves to be endearingly straight forward and sincere. Even the sorrowful Grinko, who may be corrupt and who definitely is a threat to Jessie, draws some sympathy, as he seems to embody the decay of Eastern Europe. That said, some characterizations are too precise. Noriega's Carlos, for examples, is so utterly the European lothario and Thomas Kretschmann's narcotics detective working alongside Grinko is too purely brute and thinly written, and both figures cut against the initially natural feel of the film.Still, the flaws are minor points, and they are only noticeable *because* of the film's stronger moments. (The contrivances in the plot only standout because the rest is so tightly and cleverly constructed, and the weaker characters are revealed by their surprisingly strong counterparts.) All in all, this is a truly impressive thriller which deserves a wider audience. This movie is pure suspense and intrigue. It does not have any higher agenda.

Set almost entirely in the claustrophobia of the Trans Siberian Express train that winds from Beijing to Moscow through the snowy terrain of Siberia, the story of deception and drug trafficking chugs along with some significant interruptions.  But in the end the film suffers from the monotone setting of snow and terror.A carefree young couple  is completing a missionary program of good will in Beijing for their church. Jessie (Emily Mortimer) is a photographer, Roy (Woody Harrelson) is fascinated by trains, and the couple heads home from their mission of goodwill on the Trans Siberian Express.  They share a compartment with a strange couple - the seductive Carlos (Eduardo Noriega) and his young girlfriend Abby (Kate Mara) - whose livelihood is drug trafficking.  Jessie is drawn into Carlos' world and emotional field: a tragedy occurs and Jessie must confide in her husband that the couple they were growing to know is not what they seem.  A police inspector  Grinko (Ben Kingsley) joins the train and the thriller portion of the film picks up speed until the final somewhat surprising set of discoveries complete the story.Emily Mortimer owns the screen when she is present and carries our compassion despite circumstances less than honorable.  There are holes a plenty in the script by writer/director Brad Anderson and Will Conroy, but jump on for the ride through the winter terrain - entertainment is always present.

Who is a good guy and who is a bad guy remains a mystery all the way to the finale.  For mystery and suspense fans, the newspaper rating of 4 1/2 stars holds true.  It does have some great Siberian winter aerial footage that reminded me of The Polar Express, but rest assured, the suspense and drama in no way compares.  This is no child friendly film.The R rating is for violence, torture and language. And they are in that order for a purpose.  There is a story, however, and it is of the chilling experience crossing the Siberian, in a passenger express train--chilling in more ways than one.  Drug trafficking, murder, and a bit of torture get mingled together with passengers into such a woven web that it's impossible to tell who to trust and who to run from.Woody Harrelson plays a more serious role than is normal for his film characters.  It's an interesting change and he does an excellent job in the role.  And about every emotion imaginable can be experienced from the role of his wife, played well by Emily Mortimer.Bottom line: Fine mystery.  A bit much for me during the torture scene.  Great wilderness scenery.

I felt like I was in the train with the characters and I was feeling what they were feeling. As in a nightmare when you try to run from an unrelenting force, but your legs cant move quick enough, this movie lets you see when the characters are making terrible mistakes and you can't help them. There are several interesting twists and a very satisfying ending. So, why three stars instead of four or five? For one, because Woody Harrelson is unbelievable as a Christian. Even when acting, its simply impossible for him to come remotely close to any Christian I know. Maybe his character was written thay way, who knows? His character just doesn't make sense to me. There is another flaw in the movie: I said that the ending was satisfying, which it is, but there are a lot of unlikely events that occur that lead up to the satisfying end; and for me it was too impossible.

The acting is well done.  In the end, it is either the writing or the directing that ultimately fails to deliver.An American couple are touring Russia on a cross country rail journey where the encounter drug dealers and corrupt Russian police detectives.  At one point the wife kills the drug dealer then tries to go about her journey once reunited with her husband.  But then the Russian police detective enters the scene.  Played by Ben Kingsley, this is perhaps the best character in the entire movie.  Kingsley delivers a powerful performance due mainly to his character's double life of upholding the laws against drug smuggling while working subversively for the drug cartel involved in the heroin trafficking.All of this could have lead to a thiller of an ending.  In part this is what happens, but the characters are never willing to come clean with each other regarding exactly what happened.  This is too bad because the audience knows way more than any of the investigators or the American husband.  For this reason the movie is ultimately stillborn.Woody Harrelson plays the husband and he does an admirable job.  It was nice to see him outside of the ""White Men Can't Jump"" or ""Natural Born Killers"" roles he's fallen into since leaving ""Cheers.""  But Kinglsey is who ties all the charactes together.

1176527,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B001CIOCJ4,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[3, 3]","The Trans-Siberian Train crosses a snowy, frozen landscape in this former Soviet country. During a drunken let's-show-our-scars when an old man shows his tattoo, it is one denoting the Gulag, a reminder of the brutality of the Soviet empire. Let no one forget. This tiny foreshadowing, revealed so subtly, is a chilling nod to a perverse, corrupt regime and, for the viewer, sets the tone for the things to come on this train ride.Woody Harrelson plays Roy, a naif Christian completing a mission trip in China and a long-time train buff who wants to take the Transsiberian for the ride of a lifetime. His wife Jessie (Emily Mortimer) does not mind going with him. Their cabin mates (yikes, cabin mates!), especially Carlos, a Spaniard, oozes mystery and a vague hint of corruption, while his companion Abby, a younger American, exhibits a secretive demeanor. Good guy Roy, a hail-fellow, well-met, makes friends with everyone in the dining car that night, at which time the Gulag experience is outed.This is Emily Mortimer's movie, which allows her keen talent of facial nuances  to dominate. She has a bad girl past and feels real appreciation to Roy for turning her life around. He know her secrets. Sometimes one's past is tested by a turn of events. This turn occurs when Roy intentionally does not get back on the Transsiberian during a short stop. Jessie is left on her own in this vast frozen wasteland and commits a life-changing act.When they do get back together, Jessie has a secret she does not share with Roy. This secret has wider and wider repercussions, causing greater and greater danger for them. Ben Kingsley, who won an Academy Award for playing the non-violent Gandhi, again shows his chops in this role of a Russian narcotics agent, entering the life of Roy and Jessie.Carl Jung once described white as ""the inscrutable cosmic mystery."" Snowstorms, polar bears, icebergs. The frozen and snowy Siberian landscape  is like that. What takes place there (in this film) is like that.

The suspense was incredible, the acting outstanding, and the directing was the very best of the best.An American couple have just finished some church charity work in China board a train for an eight-day ride across Siberia to Moscow.  There's a mood of suspense from the very beginning and it's clear that this train ride is not going to be pleasant.  Woody Harrelson plays the husband, Roy, a rather nave Midwesterner.  His wife, Jessie, played by Emily Mortimer is a former alcoholic and bad girl.  She's reformed now but still has a wild streak.  The train ride is ominous.  The Russians are rude and crude.  And then another couple board the train and they share a sleeping cabin with the Americans.  Carlos is a Spaniard and immediately is attracted to Jessie.  He knows a lot about customs regulations and passports and has traveled a lot.  His girlfriend, Amy, is a young American runaway.  She's out of her element as Carlos is clearly attracted to Jessie.Later, during a rest stop, Roy, who is a train buff, goes outside to inspect the train and misses the train as it takes off.  Jesse is distraught and gets off the train at the next stop, hoping that she'll meet up with her husband.  Carlos and Amy also get off and it's clear that Carlos wants to romance Jesse who is thrown into an horrific situation which develops naturally from the plot.Frankly, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I identified with Jessie and her reckless choices and seemed to be holding my breath the whole time.

""Transsiberian"" goes for the same canvas - only this time the malevolent monster is ploughing its way through the unforgiving wastes of Russia en route to Beijing in China.On board the crowded behemoth are Woody Harrelson and Emily Mortimer as the hapless idealistic religious couple who are befriended by a young set of cute backpackers, the devilishly handsome South American Eduardo Noriega and the strangely silent American Kate Mara. Following close behind is Russian policeman Ben Kingsley and his less-than-decent-to-women sidekick Thomas Kretschmann. You can guess the rest...Although the naivety of the two principal characters is a little difficult to swallow at times - especially in today's clued-up world - the story chugs along nicely - and at times grimly - from one ditzy disaster to another. Emily Mortimer is fantastic as a woman who grits her teeth and battles to save herself and her marriage to a good man - surrounded by snakes, corrupt authorities, locked doors and blocked toilets. ""Transsiberian"" also works of course because of the quality of its top principal cast - Kingsley and Harrelson are brilliant as always, but in different ways, and Noriega and Mara are believable delicious eye-candy any man or woman would fall for.But almost more than the actors is the 'other' character in the movie - the terrain itself and its people. The abandoned churches, the cruddy old train stations, the dense pine forests, the drunk locals singing on the crowded carriages showing off their Gulag war wounds - it's a world you rarely see in cinema nowadays - and therefore brings a freshness to the story that makes it all so mightily watchable. And all of this is told with a backdrop of dread lingering over their every move - the feeling that as an American or a European, if you actually were lost in the wilds of the snowy tundra, then who'd find you? And in the corrupt halls of Russia's infrastructure, who'd even care? A clever angle on an old story.Trundling its way to a very satisfactory conclusion, Paul Anderson's film must have been a cinematic treat at the local fleapit. My DVD version of it was o.k., but a friend of mine played me the American Blu Ray version which came out in the States last year (it's due Feb 2009 in the UK) and it is gobsmacking to look at - it makes a HUGE difference to your enjoyment of the film. Buy or hire that version - rather than the DVD.""Transsiberian"" is a very entertaining watch - not a five-star masterpiece by any means - but a great ride nonetheless.

1176543,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B001CIOCJ4,mirasreviews,"[1, 1]","""Transsiberian"" exploits the unsettling idea of strangers in a strange land, adrift of everything familiar, when things start to go very wrong. Jessie (Emily Mortimer) and Roy (Woody Harrelson) are an American couple taking the scenic route home from their charity work in China: a week-long train journey from Beijing to Moscow on the Trans-Siberian railway. A short-tempered Russian stewardess and a mysterious French passenger telling tales of police brutality seem like an ominous start, but Jessie and Roy are soon enjoying the trip, often in the company of a rakish Spaniard named Carlos (Eduardo Noriega) and his young American girlfriend Abby (Kate Mara), who share their compartment. When Roy is left behind in Irkutsk, the rest of the foursome get off at the next station to wait for him to catch up. Carlos' sinister charm and illicit livelihood make a dangerous cocktail when mixed with these unusual circumstances. Just how dangerous, Jessie does not discover until she meets Roy's new roommate, Russian narcotics detective Ilya Grinko (Ben Kingsley).Brad Anderson, director and co-writer of ""Transsiberian"", starts off by showing us the strain in Jessie and Roy's marriage and the inevitable discomfort of coping with a foreign culture. Everyone, including the audience, is uneasy before bad things start to happen. Straight-laced Roy is always good-natured and friendly. Jessie is less optimistic and, we soon learn, trying hard to leave behind a checkered past. These personalities will have to react in a pressure cooker situation that is so unsettling because it is so plausible. The atmosphere is both exotic and gritty and the train slithers across the Siberian countryside. Spaces are always cramped. People are always working class and not happy about it, as if this is the converse of Agatha Christie's Orient Express passenger list. The anxiety that comes from being foreigners in a strange culture is the everpresent, driving force of the story, which is why ""Transsiberian"" gets under the audience's skin. The DVD (First Look 2008) has no bonus features.

I found myself screaming at the screen for her to talk.The film's ending left her motive(s) ambiguous toward her husband as well as 1 of her travel companions. We really don't know if she is having some kind of religious guilt or fear of loosing her husband. Finally, we have no real motive, other than her possibly relieving her conscience, for her action in the next to last scene.The audience is left, kind of like her husband, with a woman of mystery. I will lower this to 3 stars but still recommend it for those of you who like suspenseful thrillers.

In the case of TRANSSIBERIAN, this is accomplished admirably. Through close camera work, an excellent performance by Emily Mortimer as well as from the supporting cast, the director Brad Anderson creates a thriller with the same drive and suspense as another train epic, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS.A midwestern American couple are returning from a missions trip to China and have decided to take the long way back via the Transsiberain train line from China to Moscow. Planned as an adventure by husband Roy (Woody Harrelson) for his wife Jess (Emily Mortimer), the close quarters of the train soon embroils the couple in the tensions of a marriage on the rocks. Roy is a bumbling if loving husband, whose unflappable good nature Jess finds confining. Jess, eager for more adventure than a seven day train ride through the snow, begins to develop an interest in a young English speaking couple who are also traveling the Transsiberian line. Carlos the male half of the new couple, is immediately drawn to Jess, whom seems to be equally attracted to a man the seemingly opposite of her husband Roy. After a mix-up leaves Jess alone with Carlos in a small Russian town overnight, the tension of the situation inexorably pulls Jess towards several decisions that have dire consequences for she and Roy.After things spiral far out of Jess' control and a former KGB agent played adroitly by Ben Kingsley begins to question both Jess and Roy about the disappearance of Carlos and his girlfriend, we learn that they were in fact drug mules. Facing the pressure of the lies she has told to protect herself, as well as the the more subtle tension of the closed quarters of the train, the suspense builds to a palpable level as the train rockets through barren landscapes. In these harsh environs, it is only Jess and Roy's wits that can keep both Jess' secrets and the Russian police at bay.Transsiberian is focused on Jess' psychological state as internal and exterior pressures mount. We see her grapple with her fears as she attempts to navigate a world completely unfamiliar to her. The claustrophobic setting of the train is a perfect metaphor for the inner turmoil of having no one to confide the truth in. The film is all to believable (to the extent it may discourage some from traveling to Russia, or even taking an extended journey by train!) because of the compelling performance turned in by Emily Mortimer who is easily the number one reason to watch this film.An entertaining if not so tightly wound suspense movie, Transsiberian is well worth renting or possibly buying if you are a fan of suspense films in Hitchcock tradition.3.5/5 Stars",4,Thrilling suspense movie in the vein of Hitchcok,1231027200,"01 4, 2009",2009,2804,"['Thrillers', 'are', 'best', 'when', 'personalize', 'fear', 'protagonist', 's', 'allow', 'viewer', 'be', 'immersed', 'world', 'as', 'frightening', 'may', 'be', 'case', 'TRANSSIBERIAN', 'accomplished', 'admirably', 'close', 'camera', 'work', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'as', 'well', 'supporting', 'cast', 'director', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'thriller', 'same', 'drive', 'suspense', 'train', 'epic', 'MURDER', 'ON', 'THE', 'ORIENT', 'EXPRESS.A', 'midwestern', 'American', 'couple', 'are', 'returning', 'missions', 'trip', 'China', 'have', 'decided', 'take', 'long', 'way', 'back', 'Transsiberain', 'train', 'line', 'China', 'Moscow', 'Planned', 'adventure', 'husband', 'Roy', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'wife', 'Jess', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'close', 'quarters', 'train', 'soon', 'couple', 'tensions', 'marriage', 'rocks', 'Roy', 'bumbling', 'loving', 'husband', 'unflappable', 'good', 'nature', 'Jess', 'confining', 'Jess', 'eager', 'more', 'adventure', 'seven', 'day', 'train', 'ride', 'snow', 'develop', 'interest', 'young', 'English', 'speaking', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'traveling', 'Transsiberian', 'line', 'Carlos', 'male', 'half', 'new', 'couple', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'Jess', 'whom', 'be', 'equally', 'attracted', 'man', 'seemingly', 'opposite', 'husband', 'Roy', 'mix-up', 'leaves', 'Jess', 'alone', 'Carlos', 'small', 'Russian', 'town', 'overnight', 'tension', 'situation', 'inexorably', 'Jess', 'several', 'decisions', 'have', 'dire', 'consequences', 'Roy.After', 'things', 'spiral', 'far', 'Jess', 'control', 'former', 'KGB', 'agent', 'played', 'adroitly', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'question', 'Jess', 'Roy', 'disappearance', 'Carlos', 'girlfriend', 'learn', 'were', 'fact', 'drug', 'mules', 'Facing', 'pressure', 'lies', 'told', 'protect', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'subtle', 'tension', 'closed', 'quarters', 'train', 'suspense', 'palpable', 'level', 'train', 'rockets', 'barren', 'landscapes', 'harsh', 'environs', 'only', 'Jess', 'Roy', 'wits', 'can', 'keep', 'Jess', 'secrets', 'Russian', 'police', 'bay.Transsiberian', 'focused', 'Jess', 'psychological', 'state', 'internal', 'exterior', 'pressures', 'mount', 'see', 'grapple', 'fears', 'navigate', 'world', 'completely', 'unfamiliar', 'claustrophobic', 'setting', 'train', 'perfect', 'metaphor', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'having', 'one', 'confide', 'truth', 'film', 'believable', 'extent', 'may', 'discourage', 'traveling', 'Russia', 'even', 'taking', 'extended', 'journey', 'train', 'compelling', 'performance', 'turned', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'who', 'easily', 'number', 'one', 'reason', 'watch', 'film.An', 'entertaining', 'not', 'so', 'tightly', 'wound', 'suspense', 'movie', 'Transsiberian', 'well', 'worth', 'renting', 'possibly', 'buying', 'are', 'fan', 'suspense', 'films', 'Hitchcock', 'tradition.3.5/5', 'Stars']",N/A

A train ride in snowy Russia full of menace and suspense. As someone who has taken long train journeys in Russia, I can attest that the movie is quite good in transmitting their feel: from the vodka-lubricated friendly warmth of new acquaintances to the all too common hostile rudeness of train employees. And have no doubts about the suspense itself: the sense of dread and danger builds up gradually from almost nonexistent to just about unbearable. Emily Mortimer is superb as the central character. She has to exhibit a very wide range of emotions and she's absolutely convincing at all stages. Woody Harrelson is cast as Mortimer's husband. He is very credible as a friendly and rather naive Iowan who hasn't done much travel outside the US. He's also a train enthusiast--one of the reasons he's so thrilled about the Transsiberian. His wife is a woman with a wild past who turned her life around after meeting her husband, a committed Christian. They have to share their cabin with a young couple: Kate Mara, a young American, and Eduardo Noriega, a handsome Spaniard. Mortimer and Harrelson soon discover that their younger cabin mates are much better traveled than they are. Although they are friendly, Mortimer senses some mystery in the story of their companions. The last among the main characters is another train passenger, an English-speaking Russian narcotics detective played by Ben Kingsley. As it is often the case, Kingsley's character is both intelligent and intense.

Jessie awakes one morning to see the couple sharing the bunk with her and Roy on the train. Abby seems rigid and weird and Carlos can't keep his eyes off Jessie. Immediately she senses something off with the couple but since Roy likes them, she decides to be polite.The two couples shoot the breeze and have drinks (all except Jessie) all the while Carlos sends flirtatious glances Jessie's way with Roy completely oblivious to how much the guy wants his wife. Roy seems to live in a world nowhere near reality and seems to never notice the obvious signs around him. Jessie is very attentive and interested in Abby and during the first time they actually exchange words, I couldn't help but catch a romantic vibe between them. It honestly seemed like Abby and Jessie were attracted to each other but if so it was never pursued.Jessie and Abby connect on a walk in which Roy never shows back up. Turns out he's been left at a train stop and Carlos who'd last seen him claims to not know where he is. Jessie gets off the train along with Carlos and Abby to wait for a lost Roy. While at a hotel Carlos tries to seduce Jessie but she doesn't fall for his bait. She does however let him take a shower in her room and she has no idea how much that minor decision will change her entire world.Jessie learns that Roy is safe and sound but cannot get back to her that day. While waiting, Carlos persuades Jessie to go off with him to ""take photos"". They go out into the snowy wilderness (alone) and Carlos makes his move on her. Jessie becomes overwhelmed for her need-for-passion and excitement that she kisses Carlos but pulls away when she can't go through with it. Carlos doesn't take no for an answer and continues to pressure her. When Jessie fights off his heated advances, he chases her through the woods where she beats him to death.And from this point the surprises really begin. I won't tell more because it would spoil the real twists of the film. Even though I liked the movie and found the acting genuine, I had real problems with Jessie's character.I couldn't feel sorry for Jessie for killing Carlos. It's not her fault, it's the writer of the film's fault. We're supposed to have sympathy for a woman who is so dumb that she goes off in the woods alone with a man she does not know, and who has been flirting with her since he met her? Jessie was obviously uncomfortable if not a little intrigued by Carlos' creepy attention on the train yet she gets off with him to take pictures? Is she a two-year old? I lost all respect and sympathy for whatever happened to Jessie the minute she left with Carlos. Maybe she wanted to sleep with him then had second thoughts, I don't know but that one action made me not give a darn about Miss Jessie.The scene where she killed Carlos was laughable. I wasn't convinced he was trying to rape her but come onto her. All he did was kiss her and she pushed him away. He did chase her but by the way it was done we don't know if he chased her to rape her or to calm her down. This scene was horribly confusing. We see no true attempted rape. At best he came onto Jessie and she freaked and killed him. But if we are supposed to believe Jessie is a victim and was so afraid the filmmakers should've given us a scene that convinced us she was scared. It just made me think Jessie overreacted and got scared but for what? And why did she kill him? She'd banged him up good enough to where he wasn't going anywhere so the last time she blasted him with the stick was just murder.This scene peed me off being a woman. It makes women look so dumb and stupid. No woman in her right mind is going to go off with a strange man who has been making unwanted advances on her. Please. You gotta have a little realism in a film for me to believe it.So from that point on I had no sympathy for Jessie. To me she killed Carlos for no reason and though I didn't necessarily want her to get caught for it, I didn't feel sorry for her either.I had issues with Roy as well. Apparently this movie makes men look stupid too. Roy seems to have no clue of anything going on and that was pathetic. All of this stuff is happening under his nose and he doesn't see any of it. It was pitiful how they made Roy so dumb just to make the plot work. Why couldn't Roy be the jealous husband and notice Carlos wanted Jessie? That would've provided a spark. But Carlos flirts and Roy doesn't even mention it once. It's not until later in the film where he finds out Jessie and him were in a hotel together that he gets a clue. Please.Abby and Carlos were my favorite characters and the only reason I kept watching. I watched after Carlos died to see what happened to Abby. Jessie and Roy were maddening because they were so stupid. Jessie took the cake. She infuriated me with her naive actions in more ways than one. I mean for example she kills Carlos yet leaves photographs on her camera proving they were together when he died? You don't have to have murdered someone before to know to erase those photos immediately. Yet she hands them over to the detective (Ben Kingsley) who, low and behold, doesn't see the pic of Carlos. Please. Please. Please.This is nowhere near a perfect movie. It's interesting to watch but makes Americans look completely stupid.",3,Stupid Men and Women,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,5474,"['Okay', 'Transsiberian', 'thriller', 'married', 'couple', 'Roy',

So, when at the helm of something that's obviously been done about 100 times in the last 20 years alone how does one make it at least seem fresh and interesting?  Apparently, and sadly, Anderson had no intention of finding out as Transsiberian is full of predictable eye rolling moments.Like every suspense film the it opens with a scene that immediately leads you, or at least it wants to lead you, to want to know more about why exactly X happened, etc.An American couple on a trip to China, apparently to help with the poor in the country (but actually on a trip to save their, your guessed it, rocky marriage.) board a train on their way to Moscow to get on a plane to head home to Iowa (also known as America's Land of the Walking Dead.)Whilst on the train the two encounter a younger couple; a pairing of people that right off the bat seems to be filled with something underlying but not completely obvious (actually, yes it is obvious, but I'm simply giving the outline here, not the critique.)One gets left behind, one makes moves, death ensues, lies form, torture, escape, some more death trailed off by a fairly uneventful and end that left this viewer simply shrugging his shoulders in discontent and disinterest.The performances aren't really anything to write home about; Kingsley does another accent, Woody plays a doofus, and more stock characters are found along the way.",2,Predictability keeps this train moving at an almost unnoticeable pace,1234656000,"02 15, 2009",2009,1694,"['Transsiberian', 'director', 'Bran', 'Anderson', 'gave', 'world', 'what', 'one', 'finest', 'horror', 'films', 'last', '19', 'years', 'film', 'Session', '9', 'point', 'though', 'was', 'steadily', 'slipping', 'nothing', 'more', 'blatantly', 'obvious', 'fact', 'nothing', 'anything', 'new', 'sun', 'So', 'when', 'helm', 'something', 'obviously', 'been', 'done', '100', 'times', 'last', '20', 'years', 'alone', 'how', 'one', 'make', 'least', 'seem', 'fresh', 'interesting', 'Apparently', 'sadly', 'Anderson', 'had', 'intention', 'finding', 'out', 'Transsiberian', 'full', 'predictable', 'eye', 'rolling', 'moments.Like', 'suspense', 'film', 'scene', 'immediately', 'least', 'lead', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'why', 'exactly', 'X', 'happened', 'etc.An', 'American', 'couple', 'trip', 'China', 'apparently', 'help', 'poor', 'country', 'actually', 'trip', 'save', 'guessed', 'rocky', 'marriage', 'board', 'train', 'way', 'Moscow', 'get', 'plane', 'head', 'home', 'Iowa', 'also', 'known', 'America', 'Land', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'Whilst', 'train', 'two', 'encounter', 'younger', 'couple', 'pairing', 'people', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'be', 'filled', 'something', 'underlying', 'not', 'completely', 'obvious', 'actually', 'yes', 'obvious', ""'m"", 'simply', 'giving', 'outline', 'here', 'not', 'critique', 'One', 'left', 'one', 'moves', 'death', 'ensues', 'form', 'torture', 'escape', 'more', 'death', 'trailed', 'off', 'fairly', 'uneventful', 'end', 'left', 'viewer', 'simply', 'shrugging', 'shoulders', 'discontent', 'disinterest.The', 'performances', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'anything', 'write', 'home', 'Kingsley', 'accent', 'Woody', 'doofus', 'more', 'stock', 'characters', 'are', 'found', 'way']",N/A

I stopped by the store and picked out every movie I could that I felt was worth spending money on.  Although I have not heard much about this movie in the past, I liked the cast (Ben Kingsley, Woody Harrelson and Emily Mortimer) and decided to give it a try.  I saw movie with three of my friends during hot Florida summer and we loved every moment of it.It is a story of an american couple who travels across Asia after their (chirch) mission in China where they were helping young orphans.  They are not the most sophisticated travelers  - typical midwestern couple wide their eyes wide and excited at every little thing they see and encounter on this trip.  On their train travel they come across another couple: a young, handsome Spaniard and his pretty american girlfriend.  The two are supposedly teachning English on a far east and traveling for fun.  Before long, this trip turns into anything but fun.  It turns out that train line is being used for drug transfer by the Russian mafia and these are guys who have no mercy when it comes to their goods and money that comes from it.It is well thought out story that is told in a compelling way.  I particularly liked Woody Harrelson who plays a naive young man trying whatever he can to save his flailing marriage.  Ben Kingley is the best actor director could choose to play a bad guy and in this movie he gives a wonderful performance and quite convincing Russian accent.

Both are phenomenal pieces of work, and both are on my list of the thousand best movies ever made (as of this writing, the former is at #86, the latter at #178). Then...something happened. I'm not sure what. But the result was that Anderson--despite still being an excellent television director (his work on &lt;em>Fringe&lt;/em> has been consistently high quality)--went off the rails something fierce when it comes to features. The first sign of this was &lt;em>Transsiberian&lt;/em>, a mystery film that, at one point, stops being a mystery film and becomes... something else. I was hoping it was a fluke. Then I saw &lt;em>Vanishing on 7th Street&lt;/em>. Sigh...Plot: train geek Roy (Woody Harrelson) and his wife Jessie (&lt;em>Shutter Island&lt;/em>'s Emily Mortimer) are trekking across the tundra on the Trans-Siberian Express. They meet another couple, Abby (&lt;em>American Horror Story&lt;/em>'s Kate Mara) and Carlos (&lt;em>The Devil's Backbone&lt;/em>'s Carlos Noriega). It becomes clear early on that not everything is as they seem with these two, and Jessie, who's become bored with the trip, finds her attraction to Carlos returned with unexpected ardor. Problem is, Carlos may really be the bad guy he makes himself out to be...All well and good, and everything's going along fine, until we get to the center of the movie, and the defining act that makes this the kind of suspense film that has the potential to be one of the greats. And then... it goes awry. We get a couple of Russian investigators (Ben Kingsley and Thomas Kretschmann) who don't even seem to know what crime they're investigating, though they will investigate it as enthusiastically as possible. And that's just the tip of the iceberg where the problems in the second half are concerned.Still, it's worth watching for the first half of the film, which is beautifully-shot, taking maximum advantage of the incredible scenery (which is in Lithuania, not Siberia, but still), and for Ben Kingsley's scenery-chewing in the second half, which is wonderful as always. ** ",3,The beginning of what would seem to be the end for Brad Anderson.,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,2282,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Transsiberian', 'lt', '>', 'Brad', 'Anderson', '2008', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'started', 'horror', 'career', 'two', 'most', 'intelligent', 'stylish', 'genre', 'films', 'modern', 'times', 'lt', '>', 'Session', '9', 'lt', '>', 'lt', '>', 'El', 'Maquinista', 'lt', '>', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'pieces', 'work', 'are', 'list', 'thousand', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'writing', 'former', '86', 'latter', '178', 'Then', 'something', 'happened', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'result', 'was', 'Anderson', 'still', 'being', 'excellent', 'television', 'director', 'work', 'lt', '>', 'Fringe', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'been', 'consistently', 'high', 'quality', 'went', 'rails', 'something', 'fierce', 'when', 'features', 'first', 'sign', 'was', 'lt', '>', 'Transsiberian', 'lt', '>', 'mystery', 'film', 'one', 'point', 'being', 'mystery', 'film', 'becomes', 'something', 'else', 'was', 'hoping', 'was', 'fluke', 'Then', 'saw', 'lt', '>', 'Vanishing', '7th', 'Street', 'lt', '>', 'Sigh', 'Plot', 'train', 'geek', 'Roy', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'wife', 'Jessie', 'lt', '>', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'are', 'trekking', 'tundra', 'Trans-Siberian', 'Express', 'meet', 'couple', 'Abby', 'lt', '>', 'American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'Carlos', 'lt', '>', 'Devil', 'Backbone', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Carlos', 'Noriega', 'clear', 'early', 'not', 'everything', 'seem', 'two', 'Jessie', 'who', 'become', 'bored', 'trip', 'attraction', 'Carlos', 'returned', 'unexpected', 'ardor', 'Problem', 'Carlos', 'may', 'really', 'be', 'bad', 'guy', 'be', 'well', 'good', 'everything', 'going', 'along', 'fine', 'get', 'center', 'movie', 'defining', 'act', 'kind', 'suspense', 'film', 'potential', 'be', 'one', 'greats', 'then', 'awry', 'get', 'couple', 'Russian', 'investigators', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Thomas', 'Kretschmann', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'crime', ""'re"", 'investigating', 'will', 'investigate', 'as', 'enthusiastically', 'possible', 'just', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'where', 'problems', 'second', 'half', 'are', 'concerned.Still', 'worth', 'watching', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'beautifully-shot', 'taking', 'maximum', 'advantage', 'incredible', 'scenery', 'Lithuania', 'not', 'Siberia', 'still', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'scenery-chewing', 'second', 'half', 'wonderful', 'always', '**']",N/A

1176562,A6FIAB28IS79,B001CIOCJ4,Samuel Chell,"[0, 0]","The plot is relatively thin, but at its heart is the familiar Hitchock pattern of the quest from innocence to knowledge, the narrative of a well-intentioned protagonist gradually implicated and entrapped in a minefield of lies and deceptions. Think ""North By Northwest,"" ""Psycho,"" ""Strangers on a Train,"" even Jimmy Stewart's restless eye and probing camera in ""Rear Window"" (with ""Murder on the Orient Express"" and ""Dr. Zhivago"" thrown in for good measure).  After that one big mistake, the big lie, ""you can go forward,"" as the inspector (Ben Kingsley) reminds the film's protagonist and us, but ""there's no going back."" Then he adds: ""Can a good girl become a killer?"" Of course the answer is ""Yes,"" especially if her innocence is already ""tainted"" by memories of past desire, fueled by a thirst for adventure, and stimulated by the voyeuristic curiosity that is the mark of any good photographer (which Hitchock assures we all become during the course of second-guessing his camera's next move).Director Brad Anderson moves his camera a lot more than Hitchcock, though it's Emily Mortimer's camera and her uses of it that interest us most. She, and to a lesser extent Eduard Noriega, exude sufficient resonance to carry a film that's long on atmosphere and scenery and short on plot complications. Much like the indelible impact of the shower scene in the middle of ""Psycho,"" the film's culmination occurs midway, before Ben Kingsley as the inspector even appears. The mixture of sex and murder, snow and blood, along with colorful frescoes from an icy Russian Orthodox cathedral, produce a chilling and thrilling, purely cinematic moment that's bound to live in our memories more securely (it turns out) than they will as images in Emily's camera.  (The ""credibility"" of this moment is problematic only when viewers fail to consider the outsized vanity and lust of the Noriega character, who is too in love with himself for the danger of a girl with a stick to make a serious impression on his consciousness, let alone a fatal one on his person.)During the last half the film degenerates into more ordinary, banally sensational thriller fare, though the score, which could just as well have been composed by Bernard Herrmann, along with some cynical but satisfying twists in the plot make matters worth while, if anticlimactic.Harrelson convincingly plays a straight-arrow Christian fundamentalist (20 years younger than the actor's actual age!), and Kingsley implies more depth and complexity than the script allows him. But for the most part, both actors are wasted in their roles (though their characters acquire wisdom thanks to the influence of the extraordinary Emily Mortimer).  Kate Mara is appropriately Gothic-looking, a face that expresses little, instead permitting the viewer to read just about anything into it (important to the final scene).The film's soundtrack includes references  to '70s pop epherma  (The Fifth Dimension, Captain and Tenille) that add to the atmosphere of the grotesque and anachronistic in latter-day Russia.  It's questionable whether the movie is ultimately the better for it, but it should be noted that, contrary to Hitchcock's films, this one marks the death of the ""male gaze."" And, thanks to the performance of Mortimer, there's absolutely no doubt in the spectator's mind about its empowered, thoroughly compelling possessor.",4,"Hitchcock fans, take notice: first half is singularly brilliant filmmaking",1236902400,"03 13, 2009",2009,3376,"['plot', 'relatively', 'thin', 'heart', 'familiar', 'Hitchock', 'pattern', 'quest', 'innocence', 'knowledge', 'narrative', 'well-intentioned', 'protagonist', 'gradually', 'implicated', 'entrapped', 'minefield', 'lies', 'deceptions', 'Think', 'North', 'Northwest', 'Psycho', 'Strangers', 'Train', 'even', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'restless', 'eye', 'probing', 'camera', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Murder', 'Orient', 'Express', 'Dr.', 'Zhivago', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'one', 'big', 'mistake', 'big', 'lie', 'can', 'go', 'forward', 'inspector', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'film', 'protagonist', 'going', 'back', 'Then', 'Can', 'good', 'girl', 'become', 'killer', 'course', 'answer', 'Yes', 'especially', 'innocence', 'already', 'tainted', 'memories', 'past', 'desire', 'fueled', 'thirst', 'adventure', 'stimulated', 'voyeuristic', 'curiosity', 'mark', 'good', 'photographer', 'Hitchock', 'become', 'course', 'second-guessing', 'camera', 'next', 'move', '.Director', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'camera', 'lot', 'more', 'Hitchcock', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'camera', 'uses', 'interest', 'most', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Eduard', 'Noriega', 'exude', 'sufficient', 'resonance', 'carry', 'film', 'long', 'atmosphere', 'scenery', 'short', 'plot', 'complications', 'Much', 'indelible', 'impact', 'shower', 'scene', 'middle', 'Psycho', 'film', 'culmination', 'midway', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'inspector', 'even', 'mixture', 'sex', 'murder', 'snow', 'blood', 'colorful', 'frescoes', 'icy', 'Russian', 'Orthodox', 'cathedral', 'produce', 'chilling', 'thrilling', 'purely', 'cinematic', 'moment', 'bound', 'live', 'memories', 'more', 'securely', 'out', 'will', 'images', 'Emily', 'camera', 'credibility', 'moment', 'problematic', 'only', 'when', 'viewers', 'fail', 'consider', 'outsized', 'vanity', 'lust', 'Noriega', 'character', 'who', 'too', 'love', 'danger', 'girl', 'stick', 'make', 'serious', 'impression', 'consciousness', 'let', 'alone', 'fatal', 'one', 'person', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'more', 'ordinary', 'banally', 'sensational', 'thriller', 'fare', 'score', 'could', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'composed', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'cynical', 'satisfying', 'twists', 'plot', 'make', 'matters', 'worth', 'anticlimactic.Harrelson', 'convincingly', 'straight-arrow', 'Christian', 'fundamentalist', '20', 'years', 'younger', 'actor', 'actual', 'age', 'Kingsley', 'implies', 'more', 'depth', 'complexity', 'script', 'most', 'part', 'actors', 'are', 'wasted', 'roles', 'characters', 'acquire', 'wisdom', 'thanks', 'influence', 'extraordinary', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'appropriately', 'Gothic-looking', 'face', 'little', 'instead', 'permitting', 'viewer', 'read', 'just', 'anything', 'important', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'references', ""'70s"", 'pop', 'epherma', 'Fifth', 'Dimension', 'Captain', 'Tenille', 'add', 'atmosphere', 'grotesque', 'anachronistic', 'latter-day', 'Russia', 'questionable', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'better', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'contrary', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'one', 'death', 'male', 'gaze', 'thanks', 'performance', 'Mortimer', 'absolutely', 'doubt', 'spectator', 'mind', 'empowered', 'thoroughly', 'compelling', 'possessor']",N/A

1176566,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001CIOCJ4,trebe,"[1, 1]","Transsiberian (2008) is a suspense thriller that works best if you just go along for the ride, and don't let the string of coincidental events that occur bother you too much.  Brad Anderson (Next Stop Wonderland) who also co-wrote the screenplay, does a very capable job of directing this adventure, that mostly involves passengers aboard a Trans-Siberian railroad train.  Although certain events lack credibility, some strong acting performances make this an interesting and compelling watch.  Some minor spoilers follow, so proceed at your own risk.This is a tale of crime with several twists, that begins with narcotics investigator Ilya Grinko (Ben Kingsley) at a crime scene, where a huge cache of drugs and cash has apparently disappeared.  The scene shifts to follow Roy (Woody Harrelson) and Jessie Nassir (Emily Mortimer), a married couple involved in humanitarian work in Beijing.  Bound for Moscow, they board the Trans-Siberian railroad for the six day journey, during which Jessie hopes to indulge her hobby of photography.  The next day, Carlos (Eduardo Noriega) and his girlfriend Abby (Kate Mara), become their cabin mates.  The two couples seem to get on pretty well, with Carlos taking a special interest in Jessie.Further along the journey, Carlos and Abby are no longer aboard the train, and after a being separated, Roy rejoins Emily accompanied by his new tovarich, Grinko.  The policeman joins the couple as their new cabin mate, and informs them that along with his associate Kolzak Yushenkov (Thomas Kretschmann), he is searching for drug smugglers.  Their investigation zeroes in on Jesse, who was the last person seen with Carlos, a person of interest.  Jesse reveals some of what she knows to buy some time, but things take an unexpectedly violent turn.  The Americans find themselves fleeing barefoot through the snow, commandeering the train, and taking it for a short, but quite eventful ride.Transsiberian is very suspenseful, with Emily Mortimer giving a fantastic edgy performance, as a desperate woman with much to hide, caught in a web of lies that are closing in on her.  The acting performances by the rest of principal cast are all very solid, and the central story is mostly well constructed.  The way the pieces fit together so conveniently, is kind of hard to believe.  Things like Grinko showing up with Roy, and then ending up in the same cabin with the couple, instead of with his buddy.  Later, without the Nassir's being aware, all the passengers somehow disappear, along with a number of train cars.  Matters take an unexpected brutal and violent turn at the end.  Although the results are highly impactful (like a runaway train), the situations are not particularly credible, as Roy goes into action hero mode.Transsiberian is well paced, has an authentic atmosphere, great looking scenery, good acting and dialog, and is generally quite entertaining, but the slick insertion of a few unlikely plot elements, slightly detracts from what is otherwise an engaging film, with an atypical ending.",4,emily mortimer shines brightly in this edgy suspense thriller...,1303171200,"04 19, 2011",2011,3041,"['Transsiberian', '2008', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'best', 'just', 'go', 'along', 'ride', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'string', 'coincidental', 'events', 'occur', 'too', 'much', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'Next', 'Stop', 'Wonderland', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'very', 'capable', 'job', 'directing', 'adventure', 'mostly', 'passengers', 'Trans-Siberian', 'railroad', 'train', 'certain', 'events', 'lack', 'credibility', 'strong', 'acting', 'performances', 'make', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'watch', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'follow', 'so', 'proceed', 'own', 'risk.This', 'tale', 'crime', 'several', 'twists', 'narcotics', 'investigator', 'Ilya', 'Grinko', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'crime', 'scene', 'where', 'huge', 'cache', 'drugs', 'cash', 'apparently', 'disappeared', 'scene', 'shifts', 'follow', 'Roy', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Jessie', 'Nassir', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'married', 'couple', 'involved', 'humanitarian', 'work', 'Beijing', 'Bound', 'Moscow', 'board', 'Trans-Siberian', 'railroad', 'six', 'day', 'journey', 'Jessie', 'indulge', 'hobby', 'photography', 'next', 'day', 'Carlos', 'Eduardo', 'Noriega', 'girlfriend', 'Abby', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'become', 'cabin', 'mates', 'two', 'couples', 'seem', 'get', 'pretty', 'well', 'Carlos', 'taking', 'special', 'interest', 'Jessie.Further', 'journey', 'Carlos', 'Abby', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'aboard', 'train', 'being', 'separated', 'Roy', 'Emily', 'accompanied', 'new', 'tovarich', 'Grinko', 'policeman', 'couple', 'new', 'cabin', 'mate', 'associate', 'Kolzak', 'Yushenkov', 'Thomas', 'Kretschmann', 'searching', 'drug', 'smugglers', 'investigation', 'zeroes', 'Jesse', 'who', 'was', 'last', 'person', 'seen', 'Carlos', 'person', 'interest', 'Jesse', 'what', 'buy', 'time', 'things', 'take', 'unexpectedly', 'violent', 'turn', 'Americans', 'find', 'fleeing', 'barefoot', 'snow', 'commandeering', 'train', 'taking', 'short', 'quite', 'eventful', 'ride.Transsiberian', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'giving', 'fantastic', 'edgy', 'performance', 'desperate', 'woman', 'much', 'hide', 'caught', 'web', 'lies', 'are', 'closing', 'acting', 'performances', 'rest', 'principal', 'cast', 'are', 'very', 'solid', 'central', 'story', 'mostly', 'well', 'constructed', 'way', 'pieces', 'fit', 'together', 'so', 'conveniently', 'kind', 'hard', 'believe', 'Things', 'Grinko', 'showing', 'up', 'Roy', 'then', 'ending', 'up', 'same', 'cabin', 'couple', 'instead', 'buddy', 'Later', 'Nassir', 'being', 'aware', 'passengers', 'somehow', 'disappear', 'number', 'train', 'cars', 'Matters', 'take', 'unexpected', 'brutal', 'violent', 'turn', 'end', 'results', 'are', 'highly', 'impactful', 'runaway', 'train', 'situations', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'credible', 'Roy', 'action', 'hero', 'mode.Transsiberian', 'well', 'paced', 'authentic', 'atmosphere', 'great', 'looking', 'scenery', 'good', 'acting', 'dialog', 'generally', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'slick', 'insertion', 'few', 'unlikely', 'plot', 'elements', 'slightly', 'what', 'otherwise', 'engaging', 'film', 'atypical', 'ending']",N/A
1176567,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001CIOCJ4,Turfseer,"[3, 11]","**This review may contains spoilers**Roy and Jessie are a young American couple who have just finished doing some volunteer work for their church in China and have decided (instead of flying) to take the Transsiberian Express to Moscow before they return to the States. Roy (played by Woody Harrelson) is a happy-go-lucky guy teamed with a neurotic wife whose chief vice is smoking cigarettes. When they meet a mysterious couple, Carlos and Abby, on the train, it's obvious that our unsuspecting couple are soon to become victims of criminal machinations a la a typical Hitchcock thriller.The story plods along for about 45 minutes before something actually happens--Roy fails to get back on the train and Jessie is forced to get off at the next stop and spend the night in a hotel with suspected drug mule Carlos and unsuspecting Abby in a room down the hall. Carlos has already put some moves on Jessie but she somehow agrees to go on a little sightseeing tour the next morning with Carlos who takes her through a forest until they arrive at a monastery in the middle of nowhere.Here's where things totally fall apart. Carlos gets more aggressive with neurotic Jessie and she assumes he's going to rape her. She finds a small log and smashes Carlos in the face. Somehow Carlos is unable to subdue the upset Jessie and moves on her again. Clunk! He gets smashed in the face again. Okay, he gets up and tries to grab her again and she smashes him a few more times on the head until one final coup de grace, killing him. Her white ski jacket now covered with blood, she manages to get all the way back to town, covering the blood spots with her hands as she walks. The whole scene is totally ludicrous, with Carlos making no attempt to avoid the blows inflicted upon him by a crazed Jessie.The story grows more absurd as we move along. Roy suddenly calls Jessie with no explanation as to why he failed to get on the train and Jessie doesn't seem too interested as to why he was such a doofis. Roy finally meets her in the town, they get back on the train, and Jessie fails to tell him that she killed Carlos. Any normal wife who's involved in such an extraordinary incident would have told their husband right away what happened and they would have simply went to the police. But no, neurotic Jessie (remember she smokes cigarettes!) has to hide the truth from Roy that she killed Carlos as well as information that Carlos planted heroin in her suitcase.Jessie can't tell Roy because of course that would kill the whole storyline especially when Ben Kingsley shows up pretending he's a detective but is actually part of a drug syndicate. When Kingsley grabs Roy and Jessie and takes them off the train to a secret hideout, Kingsley's partner wants to kill Roy and then extract information from Jessie as to where Carlos is. Instead of simply killing Roy right away, inexplicably Kingsley's ""detective"" tells his partner to merely shoot Roy in the leg (nice way to keep a character alive so they can escape!) Before Roy can get shot in the leg, Roy and Jessie make an incredible escape from the secret hideout (somehow the bad guys forgot about the door in the room they were taken to; also they forgot to tie them up!).Finally Roy and Jessie get back on the train but the bad guys have uncoupled half the train and now there's no one on it except the engineer who meek and mild Roy manages to dispose of by clunking him on the head. Roy figures out how to start the train (hmmm!!!!) but not before Kingsley and his crime syndicate partner get back on the train and are about to kill them. Wouldn't you know it, the train collides with another train coming in the other direction.All's well that end's well when Kingsley turns on his partner and disappears into the Russian wilderness. Roy and Jessie are saved and are met by Embassy officials who have them sign statements as to what has occurred (no extensive discussion of Jessie killing Carlos is brought up).Finally, the theme of the movie ('never judge a book by its cover') becomes evident when 'innocent' Abby is seen digging up the drug money and making out like a bandit. Without credibility, 'thrillers' like Transsiberian Express tend to fall apart. Not intellectual enough to be an indie 'art' film and not thrilling enough to be a commercial blockbuster, Transsiberian falls into the netherworld of forgettable film-making.Ben Kingsley manages a nice Russian accent and is probably the best thing about the film. Woody Harrelson is too one-note of a character and Emily Mortimer as Jessie is so down on herself and acts like someone afflicted with Asperger's Syndrome most of the time that we cannot believe in virtually any of her motivations. Even Carlos, the newly enlisted drug mule, fails to be much of a menacing character at all.Transsiberia doesn't have enough surprises to thrill us and whatever surprises do pop up, they're not

Vanderbent ""always curious""","[3, 10]","OK, I'm not one to read the fine print too often when I really should, so I'll give it away right at the start: the location shots for ""Transsiberian"", for budgetary or political reasons or both, were shot entirely in Lithuania, far from China, far from Moscow, far from anything that has to do with the actual Transsiberian Express train. While the plot starts off strong, as others have already noted, it has more than a few glaring holes. The acting is strong generally, making up for any weak plot development. At the end though the whole thing does come crashing down in a few shabbily put together ending scenes. After about 30 minutes I started getting the idea that perhaps this wasn't going to present the spectacular scenery one expects from the landscape the train is supposed to be traveling through. It's all pretty much the same: snow, pine forests, more snow.Roy disappears for part of the train ride and we never get to find out why or what happened to him. He just mysteriously reappears and the incident has no bearing on the plot whatsoever, something a crime writer of stature would never get away with. Emily Mortimer's acting is commendable, consistent throughout, and shows good character development. Woody Harolson's character Roy is being asked to do the unthinkable in a tense moment where they fight for their lives at the end of the movie. He and Jesse belong to a church, yet he has no qualms about killing a fellow human being to save his own and Jesse's life. His motivation should have appeared from the many conversations he has with fellow travelers in the preceding 90% of the movie, yet we don't get a clue.Why we don't get a glimpse even from Moscow after the train supposedly arrives there was a mystery to me until I read the location credits. Probably too much trouble to get the permits. Overall I enjoyed Woody's quirky and fresh character, and the few moments where the plot skilfully addressed the meaning of life and some related questions, but otherwise this was pretty much a misrepresented story.",2,Translithuanian mishap,1228089600,"12 1, 2008",2008,2045,"['OK', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'read', 'fine', 'print', 'too', 'often', 'when', 'really', 'should', 'so', ""'ll"", 'give', 'away', 'right', 'start', 'location', 'shots', 'Transsiberian', 'budgetary', 'political', 'reasons', 'were', 'shot', 'entirely', 'Lithuania', 'far', 'China', 'far', 'Moscow', 'far', 'anything', 'do', 'actual', 'Transsiberian', 'Express', 'train', 'plot', 'strong', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'noted', 'more', 'few', 'glaring', 'holes', 'acting', 'strong', 'generally', 'making', 'up', 'weak', 'plot', 'development', 'end', 'whole', 'thing', 'come', 'crashing', 'down', 'few', 'shabbily', 'put', 'together', 'ending', 'scenes', '30', 'minutes', 'started', 'getting', 'idea', 'perhaps', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'present', 'spectacular', 'scenery', 'one', 'landscape', 'train', 'supposed', 'be', 'traveling', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'snow', 'pine', 'forests', 'more', 'snow.Roy', 'disappears', 'part', 'train', 'ride', 'never', 'get', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'what', 'happened', 'just', 'mysteriously', 'reappears', 'incident', 'bearing', 'plot', 'whatsoever', 'something', 'crime', 'writer', 'stature', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'away', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'acting', 'commendable', 'consistent', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'Woody', 'Harolson', 'character', 'Roy', 'being', 'asked', 'do', 'unthinkable', 'tense', 'moment', 'where', 'fight', 'lives', 'end', 'movie', 'Jesse', 'belong', 'church', 'yet', 'qualms', 'killing', 'fellow', 'human', 'being', 'save', 'own', 'Jesse', 'life', 'motivation', 'should', 'have', 'appeared', 'many', 'conversations', 'fellow', 'travelers', 'preceding', '90', '%', 'movie', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'clue.Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'glimpse', 'even', 'Moscow', 'train', 'supposedly', 'was', 'mystery', 'read', 'location', 'credits', 'Probably', 'too', 'much', 'trouble', 'get', 'permits', 'Overall', 'enjoyed', 'Woody', 'quirky', 'fresh', 'character', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'plot', 'skilfully', 'addressed', 'meaning', 'life', 'related', 'questions', 'otherwise', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'misrepresented', 'story']",N/A

1176572,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001CIOCJ4,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","Transsiberian is a beautifully-filmed thriller with an interesting cast of characters. The story centers around an American couple, Roy [Woody Harrelson] and Jessie [Emily Mortimer] who have just completed some mission work in China and are taking the Trans-Siberian Line from Beijing to Moscow [a journey approx 5,000 miles long]. They meet a backpacking couple, Carlos [Eduardo Noriega] and Abby [Kate Mara] who appear harmless but we get uneasy vibes early on that all is not right with the pair. Carlos especially plays the suave playboy to the hilt, oozing sexual tension which may or may not be reciprocated by Jessie [Roy's wife] who is having some marital problems with her husband [she's the 'bad' girl turned good, and Roy is the good guy who loves her despite her flaws, yes, a bit stereotypical here].The plot thickens when Roy and Jessie get separated - Carlos and Abby decide to stay with Jessie till she gets reunited with Roy, and here's where trouble really starts - events get out of control and go dangerously wrong and Jessie finds herself playing a dangerous cat-and-mouse game with a Russian detective, Ilya Grinko [Ben Kingsley] who is on the trail of drug smugglers. What happens to Jessie and Roy forms the rest of the story.I thought the acting was decent all-around - especially Emily Mortimer's Jessie. Her character was the only one that I felt was well-developed - from the jaded and bored wife to a guilt and terror-stricken character whose survival instincts are forced to kick in really quick -she makes the character her own and does so credibly. Ben Kingsley did a pretty good job as the Russian detective with an agenda, spouting ridiculous sayings along the way ""...with lies you can go forward, but you cannot go back.""The element of suspense is built up slowly but surely and though there are parts that are predictable, there are also some credible plot twists. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking and enhances the plot instead of being distracting.All in all, this is a pretty decent thriller that had me riveted from beginning till end.",4,Emily Mortimer shines in this Hitchcockian thriller,1226275200,"11 10, 2008",2008,2088,"['Transsiberian', 'beautifully-filmed', 'thriller', 'interesting', 'cast', 'characters', 'story', 'centers', 'American', 'couple', 'Roy', '[', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', ']', 'Jessie', '[', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', ']', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'completed', 'mission', 'work', 'China', 'are', 'taking', 'Trans-Siberian', 'Line', 'Beijing', 'Moscow', '[', 'journey', 'approx', '5,000', 'miles', 'long', ']', 'meet', 'backpacking', 'couple', 'Carlos', '[', 'Eduardo', 'Noriega', ']', 'Abby', '[', 'Kate', 'Mara', ']', 'who', 'appear', 'harmless', 'get', 'uneasy', 'vibes', 'early', 'not', 'right', 'pair', 'Carlos', 'especially', 'suave', 'playboy', 'hilt', 'oozing', 'sexual', 'tension', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'reciprocated', 'Jessie', '[', 'Roy', 'wife', ']', 'who', 'having', 'marital', 'problems', 'husband', '[', ""'bad"", 'girl', 'turned', 'good', 'Roy', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'flaws', 'yes', 'bit', 'stereotypical', 'here', ']', '.The', 'plot', 'thickens', 'when', 'Roy', 'Jessie', 'get', 'separated', 'Carlos', 'Abby', 'decide', 'stay', 'Jessie', 'till', 'reunited', 'Roy', 'here', 'where', 'trouble', 'really', 'events', 'get', 'control', 'go', 'dangerously', 'wrong', 'Jessie', 'playing', 'dangerous', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game', 'Russian', 'detective', 'Ilya', 'Grinko', '[', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', ']', 'who', 'trail', 'drug', 'smugglers', 'What', 'Jessie', 'Roy', 'rest', 'story.I', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'decent', 'all-around', 'especially', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Jessie', 'character', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'felt', 'was', 'well-developed', 'jaded', 'bored', 'wife', 'guilt', 'terror-stricken', 'character', 'survival', 'instincts', 'are', 'forced', 'kick', 'really', 'quick', '-she', 'character', 'own', 'so', 'credibly', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'Russian', 'detective', 'agenda', 'spouting', 'ridiculous', 'sayings', 'way', 'lies', 'can', 'go', 'forward', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'back', 'element', 'suspense', 'built', 'up', 'slowly', 'surely', 'are', 'parts', 'are', 'predictable', 'are', 'also', 'credible', 'plot', 'twists', 'cinematography', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'plot', 'instead', 'being', 'distracting.All', 'pretty', 'decent', 'thriller', 'had', 'riveted', 'beginning', 'till', 'end']",N/A
