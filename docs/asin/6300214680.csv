Just like Helen Keller was too, I praise to God every day for being in life showering His glory!You gotta understand one thing that William Hurt is extermly WRONG when he don't keep his promise about not asking her to speaking. My (deaf) teacher used telling me as a child , ""If you don't want to speak, then don't let anybody force you!"" Why should I let them if you don't want for them telling you what do with your life? Not even your mom and dad.... I will tell you a true story :when I had a great speech teacher I been with for many years but I had not get a least or nope of speaking at all, but I know hard-hearing student whom successfully did.  I was envinious a lil' and asked my teacher why he got it but not me? She said ""I watched you all this years but speeching is not your thing, playing is""  What did she meant? In other words, she said it meant It was not really what I want but my parents asked for it. You just can't lock away in the room and make a deaf kid learn speaking for hours/years , it wont work (trust me) . It won't work if you lecture. They has to want it so they can put in hard working .It came to me naturally when I said the first word ""mom"" , ""dad"" and ""I LOVE YOU"". If you make a child while they doesn't want then they will walk away like Marlee did in movie. I did the same , but I was like yawning and distracted playing with something while my speech teacher taught.",5,Please read this note from deaf reviewer!,1264204800,"01 23, 2010",2010,1511,"['do', 'love', 'movie', 'million', 'times', 'similar', 'situation', 'Marlee', 'are', 'going', 'Just', 'Helen', 'Keller', 'was', 'too', 'praise', 'God', 'day', 'being', 'life', 'showering', 'glory', 'got', 'ta', 'understand', 'one', 'thing', 'William', 'Hurt', 'extermly', 'WRONG', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'keep', 'promise', 'not', 'asking', 'speaking', 'My', 'deaf', 'teacher', 'used', 'telling', 'child', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'speak', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'anybody', 'force', 'Why', 'should', 'let', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'telling', 'what', 'do', 'life', 'Not', 'even', 'mom', 'dad', 'will', 'tell', 'true', 'story', 'when', 'had', 'great', 'speech', 'teacher', 'been', 'many', 'years', 'had', 'not', 'get', 'least', 'nope', 'speaking', 'know', 'hard-hearing', 'student', 'whom', 'successfully', 'did', 'was', 'envinious', 'lil', 'asked', 'teacher', 'why', 'got', 'not', 'said', 'watched', 'years', 'speeching', 'not', 'thing', 'playing', 'What', 'did', 'meant', 'other', 'words', 'said', 'meant', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'what', 'want', 'parents', 'asked', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lock', 'away', 'room', 'make', 'deaf', 'kid', 'learn', 'speaking', 'hours/years', 'work', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'lecture', 'want', 'can', 'put', 'hard', 'working', '.It', 'came', 'naturally', 'when', 'said', 'first', 'word', 'mom', 'dad', 'LOVE', 'make', 'child', ""n't"", 'want', 'then', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'Marlee', 'did', 'movie', 'did', 'same', 'was', 'yawning', 'distracted', 'playing', 'something', 'speech', 'teacher', 'taught']",Children of a Lesser God VHS

214647,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300214680,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","I see a lot of potential when I think back over the film that was `Children of a Lesser God'.  Now, I have not seen the play but I hear that it is much harsher, much more emotionally gut punching if you will.  When I watched `Children of a Lesser God' I expected to get that, that warm feeling of unease in my core, the feeling that everything is not as it should be but instead I got a much softer and much more refined experience.  I'm not saying that a sweet and effective love story is a bad thing, but aside from the major plot point regarding Sarah Norman's hearing disability the film is your generic love story with nothing really to distinguish it from every other love story out there.Boy meets girl; boy likes girl; girl is standoffish; girl falls for guy; guy and girl have fight; boy and girl make up.I wish I could say that there was more to it than that.That isn't to say that as a love story it doesn't work well, for the wonderful performances by the two leads help elevate the film and carry it into our hearts; I just can't help myself from thinking that it could have been so much more.  I really relish in films that sink into the grit and rawness of a situation, but aside from one beautifully acted scene of aggression and emotional frustration the film is rather cheery and light; and to me that takes away from the point of the film.The film follows James Leeds, a teacher in a school for the deaf who pushes his students to learn to speak, as he falls in love with a pupil who decided to stay at the school and work as apposed to venturing out on her own.  She is calloused towards him and his attempts to speak to her rather than sign, taking it as an insult to her disability, but she soon warms to him and they start a love affair that tests their relationship in ways they never knew possible.  Leeds ideas conflict with Sarah's morals and scar her emotionally, but his persistence in the preservation of their relationship helps keep them together.I definitely feel as though the acting here is the saving grace, for both William Hurt and Marlee Matlin work hard to elevate the clich&eacute;d material they are given.  Much has been made over Marlee's Oscar win being sentimental and undeserved, but the fact of the matter is that her performance is very strong despite her material.  William Hurt is maybe even stronger, for he doesn't have a gimmick to work with and yet still manages to crawl inside his character.  I am kind of stunned that Piper Laurie received an Oscar nomination when her performance is not that noteworthy, but it isn't bad either so I can't be too upset over it.  At least she didn't win.In the end `Children of a Lesser God' is a fine film, but it is not what it could have been.  It manages to make you care about the characters but it fails to make you care about the important lessons with regard to disability that the film claims to center around.  The film is too concerned with the love affair to make the disability anything more than a side-point.",3,A film with a lesser effect...,1219881600,"08 28, 2008",2008,3014,"['see', 'lot', 'potential', 'when', 'think', 'back', 'film', 'was', 'Children', 'Lesser', 'God', 'Now', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'play', 'hear', 'much', 'harsher', 'much', 'more', 'emotionally', 'gut', 'punching', 'will', 'When', 'watched', 'Children', 'Lesser', 'God', 'expected', 'get', 'warm', 'feeling', 'unease', 'core', 'feeling', 'everything', 'not', 'should', 'be', 'instead', 'got', 'much', 'softer', 'much', 'more', 'refined', 'experience', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'sweet', 'effective', 'love', 'story', 'bad', 'thing', 'aside', 'major', 'plot', 'point', 'regarding', 'Sarah', 'Norman', 'hearing', 'disability', 'film', 'generic', 'love', 'story', 'nothing', 'really', 'distinguish', 'other', 'love', 'story', 'there.Boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'girl', 'girl', 'standoffish', 'girl', 'guy', 'guy', 'girl', 'have', 'fight', 'boy', 'girl', 'make', 'up.I', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'was', 'more', 'that.That', ""n't"", 'say', 'love', 'story', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'two', 'leads', 'help', 'elevate', 'film', 'carry', 'hearts', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'really', 'relish', 'films', 'sink', 'grit', 'rawness', 'situation', 'aside', 'one', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'scene', 'aggression', 'emotional', 'frustration', 'film', 'rather', 'cheery', 'light', 'away', 'point', 'film.The', 'film', 'James', 'Leeds', 'teacher', 'school', 'deaf', 'who', 'students', 'learn', 'speak', 'love', 'pupil', 'who', 'decided', 'stay', 'school', 'work', 'as', 'apposed', 'venturing', 'out', 'own', 'calloused', 'towards', 'attempts', 'speak', 'rather', 'sign', 'taking', 'insult', 'disability', 'soon', 'warms', 'start', 'love', 'affair', 'relationship', 'ways', 'never', 'knew', 'possible', 'Leeds', 'ideas', 'conflict', 'Sarah', 'morals', 'scar', 'emotionally', 'persistence', 'preservation', 'relationship', 'keep', 'together.I', 'definitely', 'feel', 'acting', 'here', 'saving', 'grace', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Marlee', 'Matlin', 'work', 'hard', 'elevate', 'clich', 'eacute', 'material', 'are', 'given', 'Much', 'been', 'made', 'Marlee', 'Oscar', 'win', 'being', 'sentimental', 'undeserved', 'fact', 'matter', 'performance', 'very', 'strong', 'material', 'William', 'Hurt', 'maybe', 'even', 'stronger', ""n't"", 'have', 'gimmick', 'work', 'yet', 'still', 'crawl', 'character', 'am', 'kind', 'stunned', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'when', 'performance', 'not', 'noteworthy', ""n't"", 'bad', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'upset', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'win.In', 'end', 'Children', 'Lesser', 'God', 'fine', 'film', 'not', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'make', 'care', 'characters', 'make', 'care', 'important', 'lessons', 'regard', 'disability', 'film', 'claims', 'center', 'around', 'film', 'too', 'concerned', 'love', 'affair', 'make', 'disability', 'anything', 'more', 'side-point']",Children of a Lesser God VHS

214655,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,6300214680,David Anderson,"[44, 48]","""Children of a Lesser God"" is one of the best films released in 1986, starring William Hurt and Marlee Matlin.  Its brilliant plot never loses its emotional value.  Its story about a high school teacher, James, who teaches deaf students, then meets a deaf female janitor who doesn't speak, Sarah, is unique.  As secrets are revealed about Sarah's past, the film becomes increasingly interesting.  James and Sarah later fall in love, but the battle between Sarah and her inner demons prevents the relationship to function at the fullest.  Such twists turns arise within the characters that keep audiences always awaiting anxiously for what happens next.  Therefore, this film is more than a love story; it's a story about hope.  Such combination adds more unique themes.  The distinction between the spoken words and the sign language was brilliantly translated.  Rather than typing subtitles on the lower screen during the sign language scenes, James usually speaks what they are saying.  Many say that having subtitles may have likely ruined the film's emotional affect.  Such accomplishment makes the writing more brilliant.Marlee Matlin became the youngest person to win the Oscar for the Best Actress catagory (age 21).  Her role as Sarah proved highly difficult, considering she only expressed herself nonverbally.  Her body language distinuish Sarah's emotions perfectly in every scene.  Few others have accomplished this in such magnitude.  Only one other actress has won an Oscar for playing a non-speaking lead role (Holly Hunter, ""The Piano"", 1993).  William Hurt performs his role as James wonderfully.  Though not as demanding as Matlin's role, his emotional value still holds on top.  James struggles between love and reaching out are expressed beautifully in every scene.  All other actors, major or minor, also perform their roles beautifully.""Children of a Lesser God"" is a wonderful film for those looking for powerful themes.  This is sure to continue pleasing audiences for many more years.  Its quality proves that this is destined to become a classic.",5,Emotionally Entertaining,1081296000,"04 7, 2004",2004,2072,"['Children', 'Lesser', 'God', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'released', '1986', 'starring', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Marlee', 'Matlin', 'brilliant', 'plot', 'never', 'emotional', 'value', 'story', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'James', 'who', 'deaf', 'students', 'then', 'deaf', 'female', 'janitor', 'who', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Sarah', 'unique', 'secrets', 'are', 'revealed', 'Sarah', 'past', 'film', 'increasingly', 'interesting', 'James', 'Sarah', 'later', 'fall', 'love', 'battle', 'Sarah', 'inner', 'demons', 'relationship', 'function', 'fullest', 'Such', 'twists', 'turns', 'arise', 'characters', 'keep', 'audiences', 'always', 'awaiting', 'anxiously', 'what', 'next', 'Therefore', 'film', 'more', 'love', 'story', 'story', 'hope', 'Such', 'combination', 'more', 'unique', 'themes', 'distinction', 'spoken', 'words', 'sign', 'language', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'translated', 'Rather', 'typing', 'subtitles', 'lower', 'screen', 'sign', 'language', 'scenes', 'James', 'usually', 'what', 'are', 'saying', 'Many', 'say', 'having', 'subtitles', 'may', 'have', 'likely', 'ruined', 'film', 'emotional', 'affect', 'Such', 'accomplishment', 'writing', 'more', 'brilliant.Marlee', 'Matlin', 'became', 'youngest', 'person', 'win', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', 'catagory', 'age', '21', 'role', 'Sarah', 'proved', 'highly', 'difficult', 'considering', 'only', 'expressed', 'nonverbally', 'body', 'language', 'distinuish', 'Sarah', 'emotions', 'perfectly', 'scene', 'Few', 'others', 'have', 'accomplished', 'such', 'magnitude', 'Only', 'one', 'other', 'actress', 'won', 'Oscar', 'playing', 'non-speaking', 'lead', 'role', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Piano', '1993', 'William', 'Hurt', 'role', 'James', 'wonderfully', 'Though', 'not', 'as', 'demanding', 'Matlin', 'role', 'emotional', 'value', 'still', 'top', 'James', 'love', 'reaching', 'out', 'are', 'expressed', 'beautifully', 'scene', 'other', 'actors', 'major', 'minor', 'also', 'perform', 'roles', 'beautifully', 'Children', 'Lesser', 'God', 'wonderful', 'film', 'looking', 'powerful', 'themes', 'sure', 'continue', 'pleasing', 'audiences', 'many', 'more', 'years', 'quality', 'destined', 'become', 'classic']",Children of a Lesser God VHS
214656,ADS5APY1NKTL4,6300214680,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[20, 20]","Marlee Matalin received critical acclaim and a well-deserved Academy Award, for Best Actress, in this beautiful and intelligent drama.  Sarah (Matalin) is a deaf janitor at a school for deaf children who encounters a talented and patient hearing teacher who has just arrived (William Hurt).  Together, they embark on a relationship, filled with challenges along the way.  Nevertheless, Sarah comes to learn that love and respect does exist for her in the world.  What's more, the teacher comes to gain a new perspective, understanding and sensitivity for people born without the ability to hear.  He also learns that just because they lack this sense doesn't mean they aren't gifted in other ways, with their other senses (inward and outward).  Sarah can literally express to him what a wave sounds like, as it rises out of the water, and she can sense the rhythm of music in her nose.The acting is believeable and very compelling, in this film, as William Hurt's character interprets his signing (and Sarah's) with feeling and a real connection to their unspoken language.  There are great, humorous moments in this film, as well as intense, introspective scenese, where we get a sense of Sarah's struggle to co-exsist with hearing, speaking people.  Since Sarah never spoke, she learned to build a rather isolated existence as a cleaning woman, and also as a very sensuous woman.  She never felt she belonged though.  This story truly brings dignity and humanity to this story character study of an extraordinary, intelligent and beautiful woman who just happens to live through her sensations, as a means of connecting to the sounds she cannot hear.

214667,A3IB5WCHJVJA4N,6300214680,"MF Regan ""Seth""","[2, 2]","Hollywood has often visited the story of the teacher who comes to make a difference. There have been some fine films born from that premise but Children of a Lesser God gets my vote as the really interesting one.William Hurt's James is an offering that has a real feel to it. He has wandered through some of his earlier days, drifting and learning through a variety of different disciplines and jobs (as principal Bosco points out to him while he is interviewing Hurt). He is cocky, passionate and searching but there is also the hint of arrogance in his motivations. William Hurt has never been better and he delivers a subtle, intense and yet a kind performance.Marlee Matlin's Sarah is equally as compelling and her portrayal- explosive and needing at every turn. No wonder she won the award for this work. She conveys the frustration this character feels with a precise on target delivery.What makes this story interesting is that it is the story of a teacher who reaches into himself, reaches into a quiet that has robbed a group of students of their ability to actively participate, and reaches into the life of a young woman who has imprisoned herself in her own frustration and anger. All are changed by the results and in a very real, positive and life renewing way.Randa Haines direction is restrained, inspired and poetic and the film plays like a glimpse into someone's life. It's a beautiful thing to watch and to learn something from. And while I've said it's a story of a teacher who has come to make a difference, it is also a very tender and moving story of love. Love between James and Sarah, between James and his students and between the small community that is depicted here.Special mention to of Piper Laurie and Philip Bosco's work here as the mother and the principal. They are two extremely fine character actors whose work (as always) is nothing short of a joy to watch. They lend the more sage advice that rounds this story's points out to have some real weight.If you're looking for a film that lends its love on several levels, this is the one for you.",5,James and Sarah's Story,1155600000,"08 15, 2006",2006,2081,"['Hollywood', 'often', 'visited', 'story', 'teacher', 'who', 'make', 'difference', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'films', 'born', 'premise', 'Children', 'Lesser', 'God', 'vote', 'really', 'interesting', 'one.William', 'Hurt', 'James', 'offering', 'real', 'feel', 'wandered', 'earlier', 'days', 'drifting', 'learning', 'variety', 'different', 'disciplines', 'jobs', 'principal', 'Bosco', 'out', 'interviewing', 'Hurt', 'cocky', 'passionate', 'searching', 'also', 'hint', 'arrogance', 'motivations', 'William', 'Hurt', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'subtle', 'intense', 'yet', 'kind', 'performance.Marlee', 'Matlin', 'Sarah', 'equally', 'compelling', 'portrayal-', 'explosive', 'needing', 'turn', 'wonder', 'won', 'award', 'work', 'conveys', 'frustration', 'character', 'precise', 'target', 'delivery.What', 'story', 'interesting', 'story', 'teacher', 'who', 'quiet', 'robbed', 'group', 'students', 'ability', 'actively', 'participate', 'life', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'imprisoned', 'own', 'frustration', 'anger', 'are', 'changed', 'results', 'very', 'real', 'positive', 'life', 'renewing', 'way.Randa', 'Haines', 'direction', 'restrained', 'inspired', 'poetic', 'film', 'plays', 'glimpse', 'someone', 'life', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'watch', 'learn', 'something', ""'ve"", 'said', 'story', 'teacher', 'who', 'come', 'make', 'difference', 'also', 'very', 'tender', 'moving', 'story', 'love', 'Love', 'James', 'Sarah', 'James', 'students', 'small', 'community', 'depicted', 'here.Special', 'mention', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'Philip', 'Bosco', 'work', 'here', 'mother', 'principal', 'are', 'two', 'extremely', 'fine', 'character', 'actors', 'work', 'always', 'nothing', 'short', 'joy', 'watch', 'lend', 'more', 'sage', 'advice', 'story', 'points', 'out', 'have', 'real', 'weight.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'film', 'love', 'several', 'levels', 'one']",Children of a Lesser God VHS
