1504070,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B005UNI2YI,CriticNic,"[1, 1]","""Quirky"" is a term that often comes up in my reviews. There's probably a good reason for that, as I tend to lean more towards offbeat films with an oddball sense of humor. Prairie Love had promise to have all of those quirky factors that I love about films, so needless to say it was one I was eager to see.The film takes place in the icy tundra of North Dakota. We're first introduced to a loner (Jeremy Clark), driving about the snowy roads in a beat up old station wagon, cluttered with trinkets and antique appliances and with a trailer carrying a dead deer in tow. As if that isn't a strange enough picture to imagine, our drifter happens to find a man laying in the middle of the road, near death.Normally that last part doesn't sound like it would be funny, but when the frozen young man (Garth Blomberg) suddenly awakes in his whitey tighties and begins to spring across the ice road while his skin freezes, you realize the type of humor that is in store. As it turns out, the man that nearly froze to death was in pursuit of his prison pen pal, which he believes to be the love of his life. While the drifter saved the romantic's life, something seems off about the whole situation though.Things take an even more awkward and humorous turn when we realize that the drifter is planning on stealing the romantic's, known as NoDak, girlfriend whom he hasn't yet met face to face. Thus plays out a series of unusual, darkly comical scenarios that build up to a very unlikely, and yes quirky, love story.The girl (Holly Lynn Ellis) is soon revealed and keeps up with the peculiar nature of the film. She's as strange as the rest of the characters, albeit quite cute and lovable. I can't help but wonder what she did to wind up in prison. Her naivete and innocence takes her on a journey that isn't quite what she was expecting, and perhaps wasn't what the audience was expecting as well.I mentioned I love films with a unique sense of humor. This film certainly has a lot of those characteristics. The barren landscape, North Dakotan accents, and truly bizarre characters make this picture stand out. However there were times I couldn't help but feel a little bored. Certain scenes almost felt as if they were quirky for the sake of being quirky, which to me drew away from the real appeal of the film: the characters and their story.I suppose one could argue many of the aforementioned moments of the film I didn't particularly care for only build on the zaniness of the characters, but personally to me I just felt like they were distractions. Prairie Love is still one of the better and more unique offbeat romances I've seen recently, and the finale really made up for what I felt lacked in other places in the film.Source: criticnic.com 28 December 2012Disclosure: Film sent by Film Movement",3,"Quirky and original, but lacking something",1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,2800,"['Quirky', 'term', 'often', 'up', 'reviews', 'probably', 'good', 'reason', 'tend', 'lean', 'more', 'towards', 'offbeat', 'films', 'oddball', 'sense', 'humor', 'Prairie', 'Love', 'had', 'promise', 'have', 'quirky', 'factors', 'love', 'films', 'so', 'needless', 'say', 'was', 'one', 'was', 'eager', 'see.The', 'film', 'place', 'icy', 'tundra', 'North', 'Dakota', ""'re"", 'first', 'introduced', 'loner', 'Jeremy', 'Clark', 'driving', 'snowy', 'roads', 'beat', 'up', 'old', 'station', 'wagon', 'cluttered', 'trinkets', 'antique', 'appliances', 'trailer', 'carrying', 'dead', 'deer', 'tow', ""n't"", 'strange', 'enough', 'picture', 'imagine', 'drifter', 'find', 'man', 'laying', 'middle', 'road', 'death.Normally', 'last', 'part', ""n't"", 'sound', 'would', 'be', 'funny', 'when', 'frozen', 'young', 'man', 'Garth', 'Blomberg', 'suddenly', 'whitey', 'tighties', 'spring', 'ice', 'road', 'skin', 'freezes', 'realize', 'type', 'humor', 'store', 'out', 'man', 'nearly', 'froze', 'death', 'was', 'pursuit', 'prison', 'pen', 'pal', 'be', 'love', 'life', 'drifter', 'saved', 'romantic', 'life', 'something', 'whole', 'situation', 'though.Things', 'take', 'even', 'more', 'awkward', 'humorous', 'turn', 'when', 'realize', 'drifter', 'planning', 'stealing', 'romantic', 'known', 'NoDak', 'girlfriend', 'whom', ""n't"", 'yet', 'met', 'face', 'face', 'Thus', 'out', 'series', 'unusual', 'darkly', 'comical', 'scenarios', 'build', 'up', 'very', 'unlikely', 'yes', 'quirky', 'love', 'story.The', 'girl', 'Holly', 'Lynn', 'Ellis', 'soon', 'revealed', 'up', 'peculiar', 'nature', 'film', 'as', 'strange', 'rest', 'characters', 'quite', 'cute', 'lovable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'what', 'did', 'wind', 'up', 'prison', 'naivete', 'innocence', 'journey', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'perhaps', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'audience', 'was', 'expecting', 'well.I', 'mentioned', 'love', 'films', 'unique', 'sense', 'humor', 'film', 'certainly', 'lot', 'characteristics', 'barren', 'landscape', 'North', 'Dakotan', 'accents', 'truly', 'bizarre', 'characters', 'make', 'picture', 'stand', 'out', 'However', 'were', 'times', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'little', 'bored', 'Certain', 'almost', 'felt', 'were', 'quirky', 'sake', 'being', 'quirky', 'drew', 'away', 'real', 'appeal', 'film', 'characters', 'story.I', 'suppose', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'many', 'aforementioned', 'moments', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'only', 'build', 'zaniness', 'characters', 'personally', 'just', 'felt', 'were', 'distractions', 'Prairie', 'Love', 'still', 'one', 'better', 'more', 'unique', 'offbeat', 'romances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'finale', 'really', 'made', 'up', 'what', 'felt', 'lacked', 'other', 'places', 'film.Source', 'criticnic.com', '28', 'December', '2012Disclosure', 'Film', 'sent', 'Film', 'Movement']",Prairie Love

I liked the gumption of the female character who did not stay stuck in victimhood. but also did not fall into false kindness, either. All 3 characters stayed true to their honest nature. did not really play games with each other. was understated rawness in genuineness. and the bleak environment made all the subtle aspects stand out more.

Eventually, the ""body"" recovers from the cold and turns out he's still alive. What's more, he was on his way to meet the girl for the very first time after a 3-year penpal relationship, when his truck broke down.The drifter has other plans, decides he wants to meet the girl and figures she'll never know the difference.This was a strange movie, one where you're not exactly sure what happened at the end, or what the characters were thinking.

1504074,A167K0YA96FD56,B005UNI2YI,Ian Gordon Malcomson,"[1, 1]","This movie reminds me a lot of ""Fargo"" and its many moments of jolting surprise and impromptu change. While its story or plot may initially appear to be blase - a cowboy drifter aimlessly travelling across a wide-open, snowbound prairie in a beat-up old station wagon - something suddenly happens to change all that. He picks up a hitchhiker whose car has broken down in the middle of a blizzard and, all of a sudden, that which was once a ho hum existence, now becomes a fascinating tale of love, lust and murder. As the hitchhiker shares his story about going to visit a female penpal at a local penitentiary, the drifter suddenly comes alive. As a survivor who has always lived his life on the margins of society, the wonders of sex have never been part of his lonely lifestyle. Now as he listens to the fantastic plans of his new travelling companion, his mind becomes transformed. He, too, wants to be able to have a woman in his life, and the only way he can do it is to hijack the other man's dream. This will involve acquiring critical detail about the woman waiting to be released from prison, finding a way to kill the would-be lover and, then, with his stolen identity turn up to claim his prize and enjoy the moment. Everything seems to work in his favour because he has no real identity but an assumed one. Later on, as events coalesce, the new woman of his dreams will learn the awful truth behind her new Lothario, but the power of love being what it is will stand by her man in the end as they are left to crawl through snowdrifts in an attempt to avoid the law that is closing in on them. As a backdrop to their futile efforts to escape, a church spire can be seen off in the distance, offering them the vain hope of a safe haven.",4,Crazy Love on the Lam,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,1747,"['movie', 'lot', 'Fargo', 'many', 'moments', 'jolting', 'surprise', 'impromptu', 'change', 'story', 'plot', 'may', 'initially', 'appear', 'be', 'blase', 'cowboy', 'drifter', 'aimlessly', 'travelling', 'wide-open', 'snowbound', 'prairie', 'beat-up', 'old', 'station', 'wagon', 'something', 'suddenly', 'change', 'up', 'hitchhiker', 'car', 'broken', 'down', 'middle', 'blizzard', 'sudden', 'was', 'once', 'ho', 'hum', 'existence', 'now', 'fascinating', 'tale', 'love', 'lust', 'murder', 'hitchhiker', 'shares', 'story', 'going', 'visit', 'female', 'penpal', 'local', 'penitentiary', 'drifter', 'suddenly', 'alive', 'survivor', 'who', 'always', 'lived', 'life', 'margins', 'society', 'wonders', 'sex', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'part', 'lonely', 'lifestyle', 'Now', 'fantastic', 'plans', 'new', 'travelling', 'companion', 'mind', 'transformed', 'too', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'woman', 'life', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'do', 'hijack', 'other', 'man', 'dream', 'will', 'involve', 'acquiring', 'critical', 'detail', 'woman', 'waiting', 'be', 'released', 'prison', 'finding', 'way', 'kill', 'would-be', 'lover', 'then', 'stolen', 'identity', 'turn', 'up', 'claim', 'prize', 'enjoy', 'moment', 'Everything', 'work', 'favour', 'real', 'identity', 'assumed', 'one', 'Later', 'events', 'coalesce', 'new', 'woman', 'dreams', 'will', 'learn', 'awful', 'truth', 'new', 'Lothario', 'power', 'love', 'being', 'what', 'will', 'stand', 'man', 'end', 'are', 'left', 'crawl', 'snowdrifts', 'attempt', 'avoid', 'law', 'closing', 'backdrop', 'futile', 'efforts', 'escape', 'church', 'spire', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'off', 'distance', 'offering', 'vain', 'hope', 'safe', 'haven']",Prairie Love
1504075,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005UNI2YI,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","""Prairie Love,"" from writer/director Dusty Bias, is an extremely low-budget indie that hopes that you will be captivated by its eccentricity and quirkiness.  It has an unusual and appealing story that might have been mined for big laughs or intense drama.  Bias, instead, keeps things on an even keel with a very understated tone.  If you watch a lot of independent cinema, you'll recognize many of the arty conventions here.  There is stilted dialogue, meaningful silences and stagnant camera shots taken from abstract angles.  All of these things can and have been used to good affect in numerous other films, but ""Prairie Love"" starts to feel a little monotonous due to pacing issues.  It's a real shame too, because I love the central plot line of the film and found the actors strangely appealing.  As a odd love story, the screenplay comes close to succeeding.  And as a comedy, there are hints of a great movie in evidence.  Bias has a wonderful and original idea for a movie, but it just wasn't fully satisfying for me.The tale takes place in the frozen land known as North Dakota.  As depicted here, the isolation and emptiness makes it feel a bit more like the Arctic!  A drifter (Jeremy Clark) happens upon a traveler (Garth Blomberg) lying in the middle of the road in the process of freezing to death.  He thaws the fellow off but not before perusing his personal belongings.  He is intrigued by a series of love letters from a woman in a local prison.  Socially awkward and in desperate need of company, he starts to idealize the notion of romancing the lady who sent the letters.  So he hatches a scheme to meet her.  Holly Lynn Ellis plays the woman in question and is an interesting mix of quirk and vulnerability.  The two embark on a strange courtship.  There are moments of subtle humor, but also a sadness infused into the screenplay.  Both Clark and Ellis are effective, but we never dig too deeply into actual character development.More than anything, I think that ""Prairie Love"" is supposed to be darkly amusing.  And it generally is.  Although I found the characters intriguing, I never felt close enough to them to feel genuinely connected to the movie.  There are many great moments within the film, but these parts never gelled cohesively into a bigger picture.  In the end, I liked ""Prairie Love"" without having much passion for it.  I think Bias shows great promise, however, for the picture is odd and unique.  The film is only 81 minutes, but ended up feeling much longer due to the camera work and pacing.  A near miss for me.  The DVD also has a bizarre, but pleasing, short called ""A Family Portrait.""  This five minute animated clip from Britain is strange and amusing.  It shows a family sitting for a photographer as they struggle to maintain composure while their inner thoughts manifest in unlikely ways.  Definitely fun.  Overall, the DVD rated about 3 1/2 stars.
