That next day, we went to his Moon River Theater & Grill in Branson, Missouri. We had already planned the visit, the week before his passing. At the gift shop at his theater, they had this DVD collection & I bought it. It is a great collection of musical performances from Andy Williams. It was worth every penny I spent! ""Moon River"" is a timeless song that should be played & enjoyed by people of every generation. ""Dear Heart"" makes a perfect dinner song. On the first DVD called ""Moon River & Me"" you will get to see Andy from his Moon River Theater, introduce you to some of his favorite performances he did. See Andy sing with other musical legends on the Duet DVD & then when the holidays arrive, watch Andy Williams Christmas DVD! If you ever go to Branson, Missouri, please go visit his theater & also go to the Moon River Grill. You will find Andy's Gold & Platinum records above the bar. He also has pictures & special paintings all over the place. Andy Williams, we will miss you!

My only complaint is that there is no option to watch w/o the dialogue. In case you do not know, before every single song, we the viewer gets a history lesson about the next performance. The first time around, it is interesting & informative and sort of nice to hear Andy's take on things. Sure, it's informative & sentimental but after watching the dvd's a couple times, it is slightly(increasingly?) annoying as it breaks the flow... Not to mention, I prefer seeing the younger Andy...There could have easily been an option to &#34;watch videos only&#34;. So, a big 5 stars for Andy & the amazing guests, but 3 stars for the DVD's format = 4 stars.

Maybe this is a generational thing; it is more than simply the passing of the times.

The passing of the times should not have destroyed that. It has. We do not make the time just to sit and enjoy. Mind you, today's 'reality' shows are NOT something I sit down to enjoy.
