Well guess what?, I like it!. It's far from being great, but as far as guilty pleasures go, this one is a good one. Ed 'O' Neill plays Dutch Dooley, a normal, everyday schlub who is in a relationship with a well to do woman, played by Poltergeists' JoBeth Williams. Dutch volunteers to go get her son at a private school and bring him home for Thanksgiving. Easy as pie, right?. Well, no. The kid is an uptight, snobbish brat. The ride home is full of one disaster after another. Dutch and Doyle try desperatley to get home, while the two constantly bicker at each other. During this time, Doyle gets a good dose of reality thrown in his face. Many moments are actually quite serious. Your not expecting it. The funny momets are quite humorous. All the things Dutch does to Doyle is, I must say, pretty funny. Doyle is played by Ethan Randall, who went on to appear in &quot;That Thing You Do&quot;, &quot;Vegas Vacation&quot;, &quot;Can't Hardly Wait&quot;, and the FOX series &quot;Freakylinks&quot;, which he went under Ethan Embry. 'O' Neill displays his great comedic talent and sly witicisms that he perfected on &quot;Married With Children&quot;. The ending, this being a John Hughes film, is warm, fuzzy, and happy. Would you expect anything less?. All in all, it's a decent and harmless little road movie.

303092,A3RKFHBRBAG79P,6302236088,"Graham Swearingen ""Graham1138""","[1, 1]","I am a rather big fan of Holiday movies. I have my personal favorites for Halloween and Christmas. As far as Thanksgiving, there really isn't much. There's a Charlie Brown special and that's about it. But then there is this. Dutch, the definitive Thanksgiving Holiday film. A john Hughes script that has equal feelings Home Alone and Planes, Trains and Automobiles, this road trip film about a boy and his mother's new boyfriend bonding while driving across a few states, is an instant classic. This movie isn't just great because it's basically the only live action Thanksgiving movie, this movie is great because it succeeds in every avenue a movie should. It's funny, entertaining, has subtext, a message and heart. Well shot, well cast and well acted, you'd be hard pressed to find anything about this movie not to like. This is one of those movies like A Christmas Story that should be watched every year around it's respective holiday. They don't really make movies like this anymore, which is downright disappointing.Unfortunately this movie wasn't a huge box office success or that well known so it hasn't gotten very good treatment from its studio. There are no special features on its debut Blu-Ray release besides a theatrical trailer that was included on the DVD release a few years back. Luckily the upgrade makes for a much nicer picture quality. Obviously this is the same transfer as the DVD, but the upgrade to Blu-Ray is very nice. Black levels are deep, the film grain has been retained, there is no DNR, no haloing or blurred images, and not too much distress or pops and cracks on the film transfer. Detail is sharp, colors are accurate and the movie looks all around better on Blu-Ray, probably the best it ever will as I'm sure no Hollywood Doug is pushing to have this film restored and new supplemental features commissioned for a second release on Blu-Ray or whatever format comes next. So for now, this is the best copy you can get of this movie. This movie should be in every home video library of any John Hughes fans, any fan of family comedies that don't suck, and any fan of holiday movies that want's to watching something entertaining and meaningful this Thanksgiving.",5,"The best Thanksgiving movie, period",1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,2202,"['am', 'rather', 'big', 'fan', 'Holiday', 'movies', 'have', 'personal', 'favorites', 'Halloween', 'Christmas', 'As', 'far', 'Thanksgiving', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'special', 'then', 'Dutch', 'definitive', 'Thanksgiving', 'Holiday', 'film', 'john', 'Hughes', 'script', 'equal', 'feelings', 'Home', 'Alone', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'road', 'trip', 'film', 'boy', 'mother', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'bonding', 'driving', 'few', 'states', 'instant', 'classic', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'great', 'basically', 'only', 'live', 'action', 'Thanksgiving', 'movie', 'movie', 'great', 'avenue', 'movie', 'should', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'subtext', 'message', 'heart', 'Well', 'shot', 'well', 'cast', 'well', 'acted', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'anything', 'movie', 'not', 'like', 'one', 'movies', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'year', 'respective', 'holiday', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'movies', 'anymore', 'downright', 'disappointing.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'well', 'known', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'very', 'good', 'treatment', 'studio', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'debut', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'was', 'included', 'DVD', 'release', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Luckily', 'upgrade', 'much', 'nicer', 'picture', 'quality', 'Obviously', 'same', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'upgrade', 'Blu-Ray', 'very', 'nice', 'Black', 'levels', 'are', 'deep', 'film', 'grain', 'been', 'retained', 'DNR', 'haloing', 'blurred', 'images', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'distress', 'pops', 'cracks', 'film', 'transfer', 'Detail', 'sharp', 'colors', 'are', 'accurate', 'movie', 'around', 'better', 'Blu-Ray', 'probably', 'best', 'ever', 'will', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Hollywood', 'Doug', 'pushing', 'have', 'film', 'restored', 'new', 'supplemental', 'features', 'commissioned', 'second', 'release', 'Blu-Ray', 'format', 'next', 'So', 'now', 'best', 'copy', 'can', 'get', 'movie', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'home', 'video', 'library', 'John', 'Hughes', 'fans', 'fan', 'family', 'comedies', 'do', ""n't"", 'suck', 'fan', 'holiday', 'movies', 'want', 'watching', 'something', 'entertaining', 'meaningful', 'Thanksgiving']",N/A

It's an awesome movie, and, even if it does resemble John Hughes' close movie with Steve Martin and John Candy (""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"") only to the extent that it involves trying to get home for the holidays and a road trip, from that point, it's a totally different movie and really stands on its own.Second, this movie shows that Ed O'Neill should never simply be thought of as simply the dad from ""Married with Children.""  He is an amazing actor, and I could envision NOONE else having filled this role.  He was perfect for it, and I totally could relate to him at every turn.  He was truly a fella after my own heart.The bottom line is that this simply a great movie with a great message.  Something you can watch with your old mom and pop, and your bratty neice and nephew and not worry about too much.  Brief scene with a couple of hookers, but this is played down so much and is so tongue-in-cheek, that there are no worries there.  Other than that, great movie, classic moments, outrageously funny situations and one-liners, with a good, solid message to send home.I really can't recommend it enough and was very thankful to find it being released on dvd after all this time.

The magnificent dueling performances by Ethan Embry and Ed O'Neill keep you glued to the screen like you're watching some crackerjack tennis match as the two battle back and forth.Ed O'Neill plays Dutch, a wealthy professional who feels more at ease wearing a softened pair of corduroy pants while drinking a beer and eating pretzels than he does seeing an opera or visiting the local country club.  He falls for JoBeth Williams' character, Natalie, the divorcee to a rich, snobby businessman -- the same man who has managed to turn their son Doyle against her.  Knowing that he's going to ""pop the question"" soon, Dutch volunteers to go to Doyle's ritzy boarding school in Georgia to bring him home via car for the Thanksgiving holiday.  By doing so, he's hoping that they will have a unique chance to bond and that the boy will be more loving to his mother.Ohhhhh, Dutch....what were you thinking??  It's a nightmare!!  From the moment they meet, the two are battling at every level.  Ethan Embry is OUTSTANDING as Dobsy (errr, Dwayne...uhmm, no....Digby?).  He plays the part of the spoiled rich brat to perfection.  Their funny misadventures on the road home put them in all sorts of hilarious situations...from losing their car in a freak ""accident"" to hitchhiking a ride with some hookers to spending the night at a homeless shelter.  It keeps getting funnier with every turn. Ed O'Neill takes Dutch to a whole new level with his calm, cool collectedness.  He displays incredible control of his character and you'll just be cheering for the guy the whole time.The touching moments are when we see Doyle by himself, contemplating his attitude about life and his family.  When he thinks no one is watching, Doyle is surprisingly sensitive and not so much the young adult who probably has a stock ticker in his closet...he's just a lost, struggling teenager who's as vulnerable as the rest of us.But the ultimate question is...will Dutch succeed in winning Doyle over?

303140,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,6302236088,Tim Janson,"[5, 7]","John Hughes apparently loved Planes, Trains, and Automobiles so much that he decided to remake the film as ""Dutch"" this time with Peter Faiman directing from a John Hughes story.  It's probably no coincidence that Faiman never directed another feature film after this one.  Oh, not that it's horrible mind you, it's not but you get the feeling you've seen it all before.Dutch is played Ed O' Neill, he's a regular guy who owns his own construction business and is dating Natalie.  Dutch decides he will drive Natalie's 12 year old son Doyle (ethan Embry) home from his boarding school in Georgia back home to Chicago to spend Thanksgiving with his mom.  He also thinks it would be a great way to get to know the boy.Things immediately get off on the wrong foot as Doyle takes Dutch for an intruder in his room and promptly kicks him square in the crotch!  Dutch soon finds out that Doyle is a snobbish, spoild brat of a kid who is mad at the world because his no good, stinking rich father (Chris MacDonald) has blown off his trip to see his son to spend time with his new girlfriend.Thus Dutch begins a road trip from hell with the snide doyle fighting him all along the way.  They suffer through several disasters including Doyle stealing Dutch's car and totaling it, and picking up two young prostitutes who promptly rob them leaving them with seemingly no way to get back home.  It's here where the two mis-matched partners finally begin to bond although some of the sentimentality seems a bit forced.Dutch as some laughs to be sure, particularly the scene where Dutch lights off fireworks with disastrous results.  It's the same kind of plot devices used in ""Planes, Trains, & Automobiles"" without the more exceptional talents of Steve Martin and John Candy.  Still, O'Neill plays the common, Al Bundy-type role very well and Ethan Embry is fine as spoiled Doyle, if a bit over the top.  It's certainly worth a view.  Funny and a bit heart-warming but not in the class of other films made or written by John Hughes.",3,"PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES LITE",1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,2020,"['John', 'Hughes', 'apparently', 'loved', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'so', 'much', 'decided', 'remake', 'film', 'Dutch', 'time', 'Peter', 'Faiman', 'directing', 'John', 'Hughes', 'story', 'probably', 'coincidence', 'Faiman', 'never', 'directed', 'feature', 'film', 'one', 'Oh', 'not', 'horrible', 'mind', 'not', 'get', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before.Dutch', 'played', 'Ed', 'O', 'Neill', 'regular', 'guy', 'who', 'own', 'construction', 'business', 'dating', 'Natalie', 'Dutch', 'will', 'drive', 'Natalie', '12', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Doyle', 'ethan', 'Embry', 'home', 'boarding', 'school', 'Georgia', 'back', 'home', 'Chicago', 'spend', 'Thanksgiving', 'mom', 'also', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'way', 'get', 'know', 'boy.Things', 'immediately', 'get', 'off', 'wrong', 'foot', 'Doyle', 'Dutch', 'intruder', 'room', 'promptly', 'square', 'crotch', 'Dutch', 'soon', 'out', 'Doyle', 'snobbish', 'spoild', 'brat', 'kid', 'who', 'mad', 'world', 'good', 'stinking', 'rich', 'father', 'Chris', 'MacDonald', 'blown', 'off', 'trip', 'see', 'son', 'spend', 'time', 'new', 'girlfriend.Thus', 'Dutch', 'road', 'trip', 'hell', 'snide', 'doyle', 'fighting', 'way', 'suffer', 'several', 'disasters', 'including', 'Doyle', 'stealing', 'Dutch', 'car', 'totaling', 'picking', 'up', 'two', 'young', 'prostitutes', 'who', 'promptly', 'rob', 'leaving', 'seemingly', 'way', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'here', 'where', 'two', 'mis-matched', 'partners', 'finally', 'begin', 'bond', 'sentimentality', 'bit', 'forced.Dutch', 'laughs', 'be', 'sure', 'particularly', 'scene', 'where', 'Dutch', 'off', 'fireworks', 'disastrous', 'results', 'same', 'kind', 'plot', 'devices', 'used', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'more', 'exceptional', 'talents', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'John', 'Candy', 'Still', ""O'Neill"", 'common', 'Al', 'Bundy-type', 'role', 'very', 'well', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'fine', 'spoiled', 'Doyle', 'bit', 'top', 'certainly', 'worth', 'view', 'Funny', 'bit', 'heart-warming', 'not', 'class', 'other', 'films', 'made', 'written', 'John', 'Hughes']",N/A
