961462,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000CRR32O,Grady Harp,"[10, 14]","Director Nisha Ganatra and writer Tassie Cameron seem to have most of their experience in TV movies so this little slice of the industry is a change for them.  Would that it were wholly successful because it seems as though both had a fine idea for something to say but just didn't know how to make it work. And again, blame the PR folks for making a cover for the DVD that not only seems silly, it has little to do with the story inside.Pippa McGee (Heather Graham) is a travel writer, a hedonist, and an independent woman who avoids relationships like the plague.  The film starts with a goofus dash for a wedding in which she is once again a bridesmaid on the run.  After the ceremony she jokes with her best friend Lulu (Sandra Oh) who is equally against long term relationships beyond a quick shag, and she also meets one Ian (David Sutcliffe - Under the Tuscan Sun, Testosterone, Happy Endings etc), a handsome if shy young man who though attracted to Pippa, sees her as dangerous territory.Pippa soon discovers that her father Malcolm McGee (Bruce Gray), a wealthy successful owner of a magazine conglomerate, is ill, has a heart attack, and though the father and daughter have had a negligible relationship, Pippa offers her help.  Of course, her assignment is to be editor of 'Wedding Bells' magazine her departed mother started, and Pippa takes on the epitome of everything she loathes about relationships and marriage and tries to make a go of it.  She discovers that Ian is her father's vice president and thus in charge of her new and loathed assignment.  Pippa partners with the handsome magazine photographer Hemingway Jones (Taye Diggs), has a fling, and becomes close friends and partners in an attempt to change the look of the wedding magazine.  There are far too many subplots to discuss, but suffice it to say that changes occur in the personalities of everyone involved and the ending, while entirely predictable, has enough humor and warmth to make a good evening out of a shaky story.Heather Graham handles her 'challengingly bad' role with great aplomb: she is a delight to watch. The remainder of the cast does their best with the lines they're given. This is a bit of fluff, aimed at the 'chick flick' devotees, but it has its moments.

It was like half the scenes had no beginning, they were just a middle and an end. I couldn't follow what was going on as it happened, I had to work it out afterwards, and some of the time I couldn't at all. It's not like there were a lot of complexities that were vital to the central plot, but I still want to understand details, as I assume there must be some point to them. The choppy editing is the overriding problem that makes me wish I never bothered with the movie.As for what I could follow of the story, in the first half we're seemingly led to admire Pippa's independent spirit, then when we're invested in that character it's revealed as a symptom of her fear of intimacy.We're supposed to believe that she has some kind of relationship with Taye Diggs' character, and be emotionally invested in the outcome, when he's had a total of like 1 minute of screen time, the first scene where they meet, and the second when she inexplicably shows up at his apartment, a typical example of the starting a scene in the middle thing I mentioned earlier.The it's-happy-because-they're-together/it's-sad-because-they're-not-together moments were more forced, contextless and unearned than in the vast majority of romantic comedies, and completely at odds with the overall more vague tone of the film.Maybe I just took too logical of an approach to a movie that is supposed to work on a primarily emotional level, but even the emotional wavelength on which the film attempts to draw you in doesn't seem to have much consistency.
