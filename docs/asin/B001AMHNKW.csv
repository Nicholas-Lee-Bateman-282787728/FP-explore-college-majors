There are certainly many accusations that came out of the Florida scene in the 2000 election, and while many of them were dealt with in the movie, overall, the movie doesn't devolve into a conspiracy theory. The biggest impression you will get from the movie is how many ups and downs there were for both sides.

1166336,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B001AMHNKW,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","The 2000 Presidential election was a nightmare, especially for us South Floridians. Palm Beach County was held up to the rest of the nation as some sort of black hole of ineptitude, local TV and AM radio stations saturated the airwaves with the tiniest detail of recount news while sun-starved talking heads flocked here en masse during the first month of tourist season, as if their very presence would expedite vote counts or assure the totals' validity.Mistakes were made not just in So. Fla. but statewide, and more importantly by those political operatives of both parties who tried as best they could to influence counting procedures, ballot invalidations, and the general ""spin"" of seemingly minute-by-minute developments.A motion picture about this historic election could potentially be a total bore or a chance for still disgruntled Dems to exact a bit of payback. RECOUNT is neither of these. With one exception, those 36 days of uncertainty and turmoil are presented in a fashion as fair to both sides as possible. Partisans of either candidate will not feel sleighted or that their position has been skewed or distorted.The handling of Florida State Attorney General Katherine Harris, as ably portrayed by Laura Dern, is another matter entirely. Ms. Harris is this story's scapegoat; depicted as a twinky, an airhead and a delusional fool who believes she is Biblical Queen Esther come to save the day. It's a distasteful characterization that borders on misogynistic.That issue aside, RECOUNT plays out like a thriller, thanks to a top notch cast and script, and a true story that's better than fiction. If you're a political animal of any persuasion and/or are interested in recent American history, you'll surely find this to be a fascinating biopic.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(7.6) Recount (2008) - Kevin Spacey/Bob Balaban/Ed Begley Jr./Laura Dern/John Hurt/Denis Leary/Bruce McGill/Tom Wilkinson/Mitch Pileggi/William Schallert",5,"David Morehouse: ""Mr. Vice President!

1166337,A193QINHKJ6BIN,B001AMHNKW,anonymous,"[4, 7]","GOP members of Amazon wave an imperial hand and call this film ""fair,"" on balance. That is missing the point. This was a catclysmic national tragedy the result of which many people are dead today -- leaders do matter. If 20,000 African-Americans were not thrown off the rolls, if punch card machines were not counted, bizzarely enough, by automated machines which tended to push the chads back in, if thousands of people were not confused by a ballot into voting for a candidate they despised (Pat Buchanan, who took their side), the world would be a very different one today. As usual, the tragedy was enabled by the dithering of stupid Democrats, who scared away at the first band of staged protesters, or first critical article in The New York Times.I will say that the mimicry of the Florida atmosphere, the media circus, the direct excerpts from the opinions of the court, and the dead on impressions of Christopher, Boies, Harris (from scene one a nincompoop) and Baker are eerie. Even if a few scenes have been thrown in for dramatic effect, no one is a monster and all are scrambling for self-interested political gain. It happens that right was on the Democratic side. They had no clue how to use it. (Change, much?)Taking the longer view, the very narrow establishmentarian means and methods flashed by both parties (corporate media, politicized courts, hired protesters, some vague abstraction called the hoi polloi out there, for which this is all being done for), go a long way toward explaining the mess we are in.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 5]","Surprisingly entertaining but ultimately not very topical anymore (the two sides have stayed pretty much unchanged since the 2000 Presidential election debacle in Florida), RECOUNT is engaging thanks to the powerful performances of some high-caliber actors.Kevin Spacey (Superman Returns) leads the way as attorney Ron Klain. Pulled into the legal quagmire of Al Gore's attempt to get a recount done in Florida after several irregularities popped up, Spacey is easy to watch and makes the viewer feel at home with the character/man.By his side is the foul-mouthed but implacable Michael Whooley (Dennis Leary,Ice Age 2) who fights tooth-and-nail to try and get the recount started, too, but is hamstrung by idiots within the Democratic Party and a surprise ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court (did you know that they basically elected George Bush?). Tom Wilkinson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) hits the other side of the tables (i.e., the Republicans) as James Baker. Crafty and wise, Baker gets ahead of the game and wins for his side thanks to some unique legal maneuvers.I would be remiss, however, if I didn't give some serious kudos to Laura Dern who played the role of Katherine Harris, the former Secretary of State of Florida. Winning a surprising Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actress in a made-for-TV film, Dern's Harris was absolutely flawless. Her self-absorbed persona mixed with her powerful position made me shiver, which was exactly what I should've been doing.The sad part is that with a few more dollars I think this film could've been upgraded from `made-for-TV' and had a decent showing at cinemas.

1166342,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001AMHNKW,Chris Pandolfi,"[46, 52]","What exactly went on behind the scenes of the 2000 election voting disaster, the one that decided the fates of Al Gore and George W. Bush? The HBO film ""Recount"" gives what I believe to be a fair representation of an historical event, which is ironic since the recount process put the very concept of fairness under intense scrutiny. We obviously all have an opinion on who rightfully won the presidency eight years ago, but I'm not here to debate who was right and who was wrong; I wasn't even old enough to vote back in the year 2000. I'm only here to review a movie. Yes, it tackles a political subject, but that doesn't mean it takes a definite political stance--generally speaking, each side has equal say, and not surprisingly, each side makes valid and not-so-valid points. Writer Danny Strong deserves a lot of praise, not only for showing both sides of the political spectrum, but also for not forcing us to agree with any side in particular.I have no doubt the recount was more exhausting for those running the campaigns, simply because they were doing all the hard work; both candidates did nothing more than wait for the end result. Overseeing much of Gore's campaign was his former Chief of Staff, Ron Klain (Kevin Spacey), a loyal Democrat embittered after being replaced, first by Tony Coelho, then by Bill Daley (Mitch Pileggi). On election day--November 7--the Gore team gets word of a problem in Palm Beach County, Florida: a number of voters, confused by the ballot voting system, felt they had accidentally voted for Independent Pat Buchanan. This led to a number of TV networks receiving differing poll numbers by the end of the day, some confirming Gore's victory, others confirming Bush's. Hours of retractions and projections paved the way for a statewide machine recount, which meant that Gore was not yet willing to concede.But problems arose with the machine recounts, mostly the fact that most voting centers were not willing to run the ballots through the machines a second time. They only re-tabulated the results saved on the machines' memory cards. At a certain point, machine recounts no longer seemed viable because of chads, those infamous bits of paper punched out of voting ballots. If the chad was left hanging, the machine could potentially push it back into the hole and read it as a non-vote. The same would be true of a dimpled chad (a chad not punched all the way through). Democratic strategists opted for a hand recount, believing it would more accurately reveal the voters' intentions. Klain and his team demanded the ballots be recounted in the four Florida counties likely to have voted Democratic: Broward, Miami-Dade, Volusa, and Palm Beach.This set into motion an absolute legal nightmare. Secretary of State Katherine Harris (Laura Dern)--a staunch Bush supporter--immediately oversaw the certification process for the recount, refusing to extend the November 14 deadline despite the need for more time. With the help of former Secretary of State James Baker (Tom Wilkinson), Harris and her Republican advisors announced that hand recounts were not allowed, thus suspending the entire recount process. It wasn't long before the Democrats discovered something interesting: according to Texas law--signed by Bush when he was Governor--hand recounts are preferred over machine recounts, and a dimpled chad does count as a vote. But this begs the question: Why would an out-of-state law have any bearing on the Florida recount, even if it was signed by the potential President Elect?And what about military ballots? Should they have counted at all? Keep in mind that they weren't given postmarks, signatures, or dates, meaning there was no way to prove they had been sent in before the deadline. Klain's attempts to keep these ballots out of the recount were thwarted as soon as Joseph Lieberman, Gore's running mate, publicly insisted that they be counted; at that point, it seemed less and less likely that Gore would win the election. Even when an African American pastor came forward as part of a voter purge list (simply for having a similar name to a convicted felon), little could be done to stop the inevitable. Never mind the fact that the list contained 20,000 illegal rejections, half of which were from the black population; the U.S. Supreme Court still decided to order a stay of Florida's undercounted ballots.Of course, there has to be that final moment when Gore quotes a wise man: ""I have to end this war when I know I can't win."" He says this to Klain over the phone, officially backing down and letting Bush have the presidency. It's a somber moment to be sure, although I'm hard pressed to say that the entire point of ""Recount"" was for the audience to mourn Gore's loss and condemn Bush's victory. For the most part, the film's liberal and conservative perspectives are nicely balanced. In one scene, for example, Warren Christopher (John Hurt) says, ""There's no shame in placing country above party,"" and that's a little too pacifistic for Klain's taste. Indeed, Christopher took the path of least resistance during the early stages of the recount, and he left before anything was resolved. By the time a resolution is reached, Michael Whouley (Denis Leary) walks with Klain and asks, ""If W had asked for a recount, would the Supreme Court have stopped it?"" What a thought-provoking question. If only it could be answered.",4,Every Vote Counts,1212537600,"06 4, 2008",2008,5392,"['What', 'exactly', 'went', 'scenes', '2000', 'election', 'voting', 'disaster', 'one', 'decided', 'fates', 'Al',

Lawsuits. Noisy demonstrations. The Florida Supremes.  The U.S. Supremes.  More lawyers than ants at a picnic.  A nation in suspended animation.As Dickens would say, it was the best of times. . .it was the worst of times, and the HBO film RECOUNT brings it all back--from the tension and drama to actual CNN, FOX, and network news clips.  The story is told mostly from the Democratic point of view, but why not?  Their side ultimately lost (which subsequently meant the entire country lost), so isn't this perspective inherently more interesting?  We get to meet Gore campaign operatives Ron Klain (Kevin Spacey is superb) and Michael Whouley (Denis Leary, whose expletive-laced description of Florida voting machines had me rolling on the floor), who experience endless frustration and setback after setback in their attempts to get all the votes counted.  The Gore legal team is led by former Secretary of State Warren Christopher (John Hurt), who (according to the film) gives up his strategy of diplomacy and appeasement and makes way for the more aggressive Klain.  I also got re-acquainted with Gore legal beagle David Boies (Ed Begley Jr.), who argued so eloquently before the U.S. Supreme Court.On the Bush side, Tom Wilkinson is fantastic as feisty ex-Secretary of State Jim Baker; while Bob Balaban gives a most admirable performance as Bush campaign strategist Ben Ginsberg.  But Laura Dern steals the entire show as Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris; from her Frankenstein makeup to her obvious cluelessness, this was one lady in way over her head.RECOUNT brings back all the machinations and manipulations of the legal struggle for the Presidency of the United States, but it also gives us a very human component.  For instance, at the end of the film, Baker gives Ginsberg a very moving anecdote about his switching political parties many years back.  The human aspect adds to the drama and the intrigue, which makes reliving the 2000 election in RECOUNT a most rewarding experience.--D.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 4]","This film is one of the most riveting I've seen, and not for anything other than the pure simple truth.Here we have the story of the Gore campaign for the presidency in 2000...the Republican strategy to throw Gore off his feet...the hullabaloo over the stupid voting machines and incredibly, it lessens the idea that the voters were the stupid ones.This film actually teaches us what happened in the presidential race of 2000--which wasn't actually settled until March, when the Supreme Court gave Bush the presidency. Finely cast, though no attempt is made to render good portrayals except for John Hurt's rather flawed Warren Cristopher and Tom Wilkinson's brilliant Jim Baker. I found the chemistry raging between Dennis Leary and Kevin Spacey to be the best on film, and the tension this film manages to generate gives the viewer a clue about what it was like participating and voting in that election.One of the most chilling scenes (I was cheering because I knew the truth at the time) was when crowds of people stormed in to protest the original hand recount. It turns out they were Republican go-fers, flown in by the Republican leadership to disrupt--and stop--the hand recount. My wife and I saw this activity live at the time and we knew immediately that those people were NOT ordinary citizens. It wasn't until this movie that the truth was brutally stated. It's worth it for that sequence in our history alone, because as the film stated, this was the first time in our history that Congress hired out a mob to take direct action in public.This film MUST be shown at schools everywhere, even if it's only to understand where the term ""chad"" originated!

Rooney,"[12, 18]","""Recount"" is a brilliant docu-drama using actors and lots of real television footage to encapsulate the 2000 election fiasco in which George W. Bush was given the Presidency by a 5 to 4 vote by the Supreme Court of the United States in an unprecedented intervention in a presidential election recount.I was a resident of Florida during this fateful period in American history, and it was an embarrassing and enlightening moment for Florida voters.Kevin Spacey does a superb acting job portraying the point man for the Gore recount in the Sunshine State. Ex-Secretary of State Jim Baker played smart hardball for the Republican cause while ex-Secretary of State Warren Christopher proved how gutless, prim, proper, and pitiful he was as Gore's first leader in the recount. Joe Lieberman, Gore's vice-presidential running mate, helped to undermine the Gore recount.The deck was stacked against Gore by Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris (with a devastating portrayal by Laura Dern) and by Governor Jeb Bush. They had laid the groundwork for a Republican victory. Gore nationwide won the popular vote by a half million votes, but in Florida there were improper vote counting, all kinds of screw-ups, poorly designed ballots, undercounting, and the disqualification of thousands who were turned away from the polls because their names were incorrectly placed on a felons' list.Does this movie make a compelling case that an election was stolen? Yes. Is the movie biased in favor of the Gore faction? Yes. Should the Democrats have been moreaggressive and fought harder, earlier in the recount? Yes. Should Gore himself have gone to Florida and led the charge thus showing himself as gutsy and strong-willed enough to be President? Yes.If the Supreme Court hadn't acted, the Florida Legislature, Republican controlled, was ready to declare Bush the winner. Talk about a stacked deck. I think the villains in this whole piece are the American people who stood idly by and by their apathy and lack of involvement proved that a person to be president has to have that ""fire in the belly,"" but when the people in this democracy lack that ""fire in the belly"" to preserve the right for every vote to be counted, we are in real danger of losing our democracy.",5,Every Vote Counts - Maybe,1216080000,"07 15, 2008",2008,2256,"['Recount', 'brilliant', 'docu-drama', 'using', 'actors', 'lots', 'real', 'television', 'footage', 'encapsulate', '2000', 'election', 'fiasco', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'was', 'given', 'Presidency', '5', '4', 'vote', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'United', 'States', 'unprecedented', 'intervention', 'presidential', 'election', 'recount.I', 'was', 'resident', 'Florida', 'fateful', 'period', 'American', 'history', 'was', 'embarrassing', 'enlightening', 'moment', 'Florida', 'voters.Kevin', 'Spacey', 'superb', 'acting', 'job', 'portraying', 'point', 'man', 'Gore', 'recount', 'Sunshine', 'State', 'Ex-Secretary', 'State', 'Jim', 'Baker', 'played', 'smart', 'hardball', 'Republican', 'cause', 'ex-Secretary', 'State', 'Warren', 'Christopher', 'proved', 'how', 'gutless', 'prim', 'proper', 'pitiful', 'was', 'Gore', 'first', 'leader', 'recount', 'Joe', 'Lieberman', 'Gore', 'vice-presidential', 'running', 'mate', 'helped', 'undermine', 'Gore', 'recount.The', 'deck', 'was', 'stacked', 'Gore', 'Florida', 'Secretary', 'State', 'Katherine', 'Harris', 'devastating', 'portrayal', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'Governor', 'Jeb', 'Bush', 'had', 'laid', 'groundwork', 'Republican', 'victory', 'Gore', 'nationwide', 'won', 'popular', 'vote', 'half', 'million', 'votes', 'Florida', 'were', 'improper', 'vote', 'counting', 'kinds', 'screw-ups', 'poorly', 'designed', 'ballots', 'undercounting', 'disqualification', 'thousands', 'who', 'were', 'turned', 'away', 'polls', 'names', 'were', 'incorrectly', 'placed', 'felons', 'list.Does', 'movie', 'make', 'compelling', 'case', 'election', 'was', 'stolen', 'Yes', 'movie', 'biased', 'favor', 'Gore', 'faction', 'Yes', 'Should', 'Democrats', 'have', 'been', 'moreaggressive', 'fought', 'harder', 'earlier', 'recount', 'Yes', 'Should', 'Gore', 'have', 'gone', 'Florida', 'led', 'charge', 'thus', 'showing', 'gutsy', 'strong-willed', 'enough', 'be', 'President', 'Yes.If', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'had', ""n't"", 'acted', 'Florida', 'Legislature', 'Republican', 'controlled', 'was', 'ready', 'declare', 'Bush', 'winner', 'Talk', 'stacked', 'deck', 'think', 'villains', 'whole', 'piece', 'are', 'American', 'people', 'who', 'stood', 'idly', 'apathy', 'lack', 'involvement', 'proved', 'person', 'be', 'president', 'have', 'fire', 'belly', 'when', 'people', 'democracy', 'fire', 'belly', 'preserve', 'right', 'vote', 'be', 'counted', 'are', 'real', 'danger', 'losing', 'democracy']",Recount: The Story Of The 2000 Presidential Election

Whether Gore would have done better than Bush after 9/11 as Commander in Chief is also unknown although it's not difficult to speculate.

1166355,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B001AMHNKW,kaduzy,"[5, 7]","This movie is incredibly painful to watch.  Anyone who lived through the 2000 election will remember what happened in broad strokes -- corruption, possible fraud, extreme partisanship and cronyism, and disenfranchisement on a scale that creates fond nostalgia for Jim Crow.  However those broad strokes are here shown in rage-inducing, fully restored technicolor detail as every single step of a process that resulted in what some people still see as a stolen election is put on display.Old wounds die hard, and even after 8 years and ""A New Hope"" on the horizon, it's impossible for any politically conscious person to watch this movie silently.  Frustration boils over again and again at tactics from both sides of the aisle, and you may eventually have to put on a hat to prevent yourself from tearing every strand of your hair out.  Even though we all know how this story ended, the movie is so well-written that it all feels fresh and current even now.  Dramatically, that's a great thing.  In all other respects though, it just makes your blood boil.  In fact, I nearly gave the movie four stars until it occurred to me that what I had a problem with was the real events, not the movie.  And in fact, only a great movie could make you think this critically about the real events on which it's based.Danny Strong shockingly pulled off his first script to perfection, which is a coup for any young writer but particularly surprising for someone who is an actor perhaps best known as the geek from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""  He brings to light the myriad ways in which a single decision, action or chance event could have changed history completely.  There are so many occasions in this film when I felt like I was watching a horror movie, screaming for the hero to turn around, run away or stay out of the basement.  The cast is what makes these 8-year-old bad choices seem so relevant again.  Kevin Spacey, Dennis Leary and Tom Wilkinson are excellent.  (So are Laura Dern and Bob Balaban, but I hated the characters/real people so much that it's difficult for me to get past that and give the actors the praise they're due.)  Ed Begley Jr. is also quite good, though it's weird to see him in a straight dramatic role.  After seeing him play so many hilarious parts in Christopher Guest's ensemble mockumentaries, I kept expecting him to turn to the camera and make a dry, hilariously off-hand remark.The extras include two interviews with actual participants from each side of the fight conducted by the actors who played them, a short featurette on the movie and the location filming in Florida and a commentary with the writer and director.  I haven't had a chance to listen to the commentary yet, but I'm hoping that since Danny Strong spent so much time interviewing the real participants, he'll have a lot more anecdotes and stories that simply couldn't be fit into the script.  As for the interviews, I only wish they were longer.Any student of political science will want to see this movie, and every American voter probably SHOULD see this movie.  Some might say that there's nothing to be gained by dwelling on the past, but looking back at this all-too-recent period in modern history should be a wake-up call about the flaws in our system, both legal and political.  Only when enough Americans truly wake up to this will we be able to make any real changes.  Until that time, people like the ones depicted here --ALL OF WHOM ARE REAL, LIVING BREATHING PEOPLE AND **NOT** FICTIONAL CREATIONS -- will continue to manipulate the system to their own will, which will be that of whatever political party they happen to be aligned with and have nothing whatsoever to do with justice, fairness or morality.The truth is, that fact alone should classify this as a horror movie.

Like watching a movie about a sporting event or athlete where you know the end, it's about the game itself. This film is about the Florida recount in 2000 as seen mainly through the person of Ron Klain, Al Gore's former Chief of Staff who was dispatched to Florida to head up the Democratic team pursuing the recount. The acting is terrific and so is the writing. Since the event is so recent and all the players are still living, getting the story straight was important and it seems that they did. Even knowing the ending, this movie draws you in so that you almost forget what happened as you follow the events and drama within the inner circle of each party as they fight for Florida's 25 electoral votes and the Presidency. It's really a story about democracy and how it does and doesn't work, about our legal system and how it does and doesn't work and whether a Republic like ours can survive a crisis like that. Whether you think the system works, depends, of course, on what side you were on but our country did survive and I think some credit must be given to the parties involved, particularly Al Gore as the underdog, who could have gotten their supporters all riled up and created a very ugly situation. There were hardly any demonstrations by Democrats. Gore also called off the pursuit in the end when he could have continued to the further detriment of the country. It seems that there was a tangible case of 'Country First'. It is also a reminder that we still don't have this voting thing figured out in our country. We can put the proverbial man or woman on the moon but can't develop a consistent, reliable national voting system for national elections. Maybe there's a case for letting each state and precinct determine its own way, but in an election that affects every one of us, I'd like to think we were all playing by the same rules. This is another outstanding docudrama by HBO. Enjoy during this election year. Who knows, maybe it will be deja vu all over again.

1166360,AL4MKKO24563R,B001AMHNKW,Michael K. Beusch,"[2, 4]","I'm sure that a lot of Republicans who saw Recount complained that the film is biased towards the Democratic side of the story. To be sure, the Democrats (led by Kevin Spacey as Ron Klain, Denis Leary as Michael Whouley and Ed Begley as David Boies) are clearly meant to be way more sympathetic than the Republicans (led by Tom Wilkinson as James Baker, Bob Balaban as Ben Ginsberg and, hilariously, Laura Dern as Katherine Harris). I have to admit that were I a Republican, it would be very easy to label Recount as yet another biased Hollywood product. However, the bias that appears so blatant on the surface is not as glaring when one digs deeper.First of all, at least some of the dirty tricks detailed in Recount did indeed happen. The Florida GOP did suppress the vote by striking voters from the lists in minority districts who happened to have the same names as convicted felons. The GOP did encourage their supporters to harrass and intimidate election officials who were reviewing the ballots. The incident where hundreds of angry Bush supporters banged on the door of the office where the ballots were being counted was recorded on tape (in fact, a clip of the real incident is shown over the closing credits). And while it probably won't count as a dirty trick, the Supreme Court's ruling in Bush vs. Gore did indeed contain a clause that said that decision would not be binding in future cases. All of these incidents are documented.Obviously, Katherine Harris could not have been happy with her portrayal in Recount. (Most of the cast met with their real life counterparts with the exception of Dern with Harris) However, Harris never threatened legal action against the filmmakers, indicating that either she didn't feel taking legal action was worth the trouble or that what the film said about her, while extremely unflattering, was basically true. Harris is portrayed as stupid, shallow, vain and clueless so it's hard to believe that she, as a person with political ambitions, would let such a damaging portrayal slide if it wasn't based in truth.In addition, James Baker and Ben Ginsberg have both given Recount largely good reviews (Baker even hosted a screening of the film). Baker did point out several inaccuracies in Recount, but did state that he thought that the filmmakers ""went out of their way to reach out to both sides.""To be sure, many of the Democrats are not portrayed in a sympathetic light. Bill Daley (Mitch Pileggi) gives up and basically disappears halfway through the recount battle. Warren Christopher (John Hurt) is portrayed as effete, ineffective negotiator who is more concerned about decorum than actually winning the election for Gore. In fact, aside from Katherine Harris, the real life counterpart who had the most problems with his portrayal was Christopher. Even Baker defended Christopher, claming that the former Secretary of State wasn't nearly as ""wimpish"" as he was portrayed in Recount.Hollywood always takes some license, no matter what the subject matter. The climactic meeting between Spacey's Klain and Wilkinson's Baker, for example, never happened (Baker claimed it was added to add a bipartisan touch to the film). However, Recount is hardly as radically biased as some might claim. For example, when James Baker tells Ben Ginsberg of his wife's death and George H.W. Bush's kind offer to run his Congressional campaign as a way to get his mind off his loss, I don't think anyone -- Democrat or Republican -- will not be moved by the story. Recount, despite any claims to the contrary, is much more shades of gray than simple black and white.",5,Republicans: Before you scream bias ...,1231977600,"01 15, 2009",2009,3608,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'Republicans', 'who', 'saw', 'Recount', 'complained', 'film', 'biased', 'Democratic', 'side', 'story', 'be', 'sure', 'Democrats', 'led', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Ron', 'Klain', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'Michael', 'Whouley', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'David', 'Boies', 'are', 'clearly', 'meant', 'be', 'way', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'Republicans', 'led', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'James', 'Baker', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'Ben', 'Ginsberg', 'hilariously', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'Katherine', 'Harris', 'have', 'admit', 'were', 'Republican', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'easy', 'label', 'Recount', 'yet', 'biased', 'Hollywood', 'product', 'However', 'bias', 'so', 'blatant', 'surface', 'not', 'glaring', 'when', 'one', 'deeper.First', 'least', 'dirty', 'tricks', 'detailed', 'Recount', 'did', 'indeed', 'happen', 'Florida', 'GOP', 'did', 'suppress', 'vote', 'striking', 'voters', 'lists', 'minority', 'districts', 'who', 'happened', 'have', 'same', 'names', 'convicted', 'felons', 'GOP', 'did', 'encourage', 'supporters', 'harrass', 'intimidate', 'election', 'officials', 'who', 'were', 'reviewing', 'ballots', 'incident', 'where', 'hundreds', 'angry', 'Bush', 'supporters', 'banged', 'door', 'office', 'where', 'ballots', 'were', 'being', 'counted', 'was', 'recorded', 'tape', 'fact', 'clip', 'real', 'incident', 'shown', 'closing', 'credits', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'count', 'dirty', 'trick', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'ruling', 'Bush', 'vs.', 'Gore', 'did', 'indeed', 'contain', 'clause', 'said', 'decision', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'binding', 'future', 'cases', 'incidents', 'are', 'documented.Obviously', 'Katherine', 'Harris', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'happy', 'portrayal', 'Recount', 'Most', 'cast', 'met', 'real', 'life', 'counterparts', 'exception', 'Dern', 'Harris', 'However', 'Harris', 'never', 'threatened', 'legal', 'action', 'filmmakers', 'indicating', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'taking', 'legal', 'action', 'was', 'trouble', 'what', 'film', 'said', 'extremely', 'unflattering', 'was', 'basically', 'true', 'Harris', 'portrayed', 'stupid', 'shallow', 'vain', 'clueless', 'hard', 'believe', 'person', 'political', 'ambitions', 'would', 'let', 'such', 'damaging', 'portrayal', 'slide', 'was', ""n't"", 'based', 'truth.In', 'addition', 'James', 'Baker', 'Ben', 'Ginsberg', 'have', 'given', 'Recount', 'largely', 'good', 'reviews', 'Baker', 'even', 'hosted', 'screening', 'film', 'Baker', 'did', 'point', 'out', 'several', 'inaccuracies', 'Recount', 'did', 'state', 'thought', 'filmmakers', 'went', 'way', 'reach', 'out', 'sides', 'be', 'sure', 'many', 'Democrats', 'are', 'not', 'portrayed', 'sympathetic', 'light', 'Bill', 'Daley', 'Mitch', 'Pileggi', 'up', 'basically', 'halfway', 'recount', 'battle', 'Warren', 'Christopher', 'John', 'Hurt', 'portrayed', 'effete', 'ineffective', 'negotiator', 'who', 'more', 'concerned', 'decorum', 'actually', 'winning', 'election', 'Gore', 'fact', 'aside', 'Katherine', 'Harris', 'real', 'life', 'counterpart', 'who', 'had', 'most', 'problems', 'portrayal', 'was', 'Christopher', 'Even', 'Baker', 'defended', 'Christopher', 'claming', 'former', 'Secretary', 'State', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'wimpish', 'was', 'portrayed', 'Recount.Hollywood', 'always', 'license', 'matter', 'what', 'subject', 'matter', 'climactic', 'meeting', 'Spacey', 'Klain', 'Wilkinson', 'Baker', 'example', 'never', 'happened', 'Baker', 'claimed', 'was', 'added', 'add', 'bipartisan', 'touch', 'film', 'However', 'Recount', 'hardly', 'radically', 'biased', 'might', 'claim', 'example', 'when', 'James', 'Baker', 'Ben', 'Ginsberg', 'wife', 'death', 'George', 'H.W', 'Bush', 'kind', 'offer', 'run', 'Congressional', 'campaign', 'way', 'get', 'mind', 'loss', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'Democrat', 'Republican', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'moved', 'story', 'Recount', 'claims', 'contrary', 'much', 'more', 'shades', 'gray', 'simple', 'black', 'white']",Recount: The Story Of The 2000 Presidential Election

""Angels in America"", ""Wit"", ""Elizabeth"", and the list goes on.  On top of it, Jay Roach from the ""Austin Powers"" and ""Meet the Parents"" films attacks this based-on-true-story telefilm with gusto and panache.  A wonderful cast and screenplay makes this work perfectly.  It has the suspense, drama, and humor that rarely happens in most political films.  Kevin Spacey plays the central character, Ron Klain, who gets the most air time.  He constantly battles with the James Baker character played wonderfully by Tom Wilkinson.  Both Denis Leary and Laura Dern adds humor as Michael Whouley and Katherine Harris respectively.People may think after watching that it paints the Bush recount team in an unfavorable light.  The Gore team looks almost desperate to grab more time and votes.  However you may feel in this whole chaotic scene of events, it shows how our system was certainly challenged.  First, it was at the county level, state level, and finally federal level.  Fingers are pointed at each other.  Battles lost and won.  Who really won is still up to debate.  This film gives not only entertainment value but serious reflection on our voting process.  Interpretation is a dangerous area which can lead to serious consequences.This DVD has a boat load of extras which probably didn't make it on HBO.

1166364,A2RAU617VTJMBX,B001AMHNKW,Sigrid Macdonald,"[2, 3]","Recount is a stunning docudrama -- a fictionalized event of the most unprecedented election in the United States between George Bush and Al Gore in the year 2000. The movie sticks pretty close to the facts, although it diverges in certain parts for dramatic impact.While I was watching it, I thought that it was pretty partisan in favor of the Democrats; however, later on when I watched selected features, which included interviews with both Democratic and Republican key players, I realized that Recount tried to be fair.Any which way you look at it, the election results in Florida were a disaster that year. Many seniors became confused by the ballots and thought that they were voting for Gore when instead they voted for Buchanan. Up to 20,000 people were wrongly considered to be felons and prevented from voting, many of whom were African-American. African-Americans were also adversely affected because some of the polling machines that malfunctioned were in poorer neighborhoods that blacks were more likely to inhabit.Democrats asked for a recount but instead of asking to count the entire state of Florida, or better yet, to have Florida return to the polls to vote again, they hand-picked certain counties that were more likely to have voted for Gore. And Democrats had issues with some of the military ballots, rightly so, because they lacked postmarks, which made it hard to determine if they had been received by the deadline. Since many military men and women are more likely to vote Republican, arguing to disregard those votes would have been tantamount to subtracting votes for Bush.The official conclusion of this movie is that we'll never really know who won the election of 2000, but it seemed to me that the unofficial conclusion was that Al Gore won and that the Supreme Court was way out of line by giving the election to Bush (easy to do when the Secretary of State was a Republican friend and fan of the Texas governor's, and Bush's brother was the governor of Florida). Much more disconcerting is the notion that we can't really trust our polling devices. What the hell is this about hanging chad? I'm an American living in Canada for the last 20 years and we have ballots that are very direct. I just mark an X right next to the person I want to vote for. Only one person on each line. No way to get confused and very simple to recount by hand if there's a need.Another unsettling feature of this movie, that continues to pop up in recent elections, is that the population is pretty well divided down the middle in terms of the two-party system. It's shocking in a country of 330 million people that *anyone* can win by 1784 votes or 324 votes or 154 votes or however which way you want to count the fiasco in Florida. A clear presidential victory would have someone winning by tens of thousands of votes, at least. Our presidents don't really have a mandate to rule. They are squeaking in, almost as minority governments. That even split is as scary as the ballot process in the US.",4,This Could Happen Again,1281312000,"08 9, 2010",2010,3013,"['Recount', 'stunning', 'docudrama', 'fictionalized', 'event', 'most', 'unprecedented', 'election', 'United', 'States', 'George', 'Bush', 'Al', 'Gore', 'year', '2000', 'movie', 'pretty', 'close', 'facts', 'certain', 'parts', 'dramatic', 'impact.While', 'was', 'watching', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'partisan', 'favor', 'Democrats', 'however', 'later', 'when', 'watched', 'selected', 'features', 'included', 'interviews', 'Democratic', 'Republican', 'key', 'players', 'realized', 'Recount', 'tried', 'be', 'fair.Any', 'way', 'look', 'election', 'results', 'Florida', 'were', 'disaster', 'year', 'Many', 'seniors', 'became', 'confused', 'ballots', 'thought', 'were', 'voting', 'Gore', 'when', 'instead', 'voted', 'Buchanan', 'Up', '20,000', 'people', 'were', 'wrongly', 'considered', 'be', 'felons', 'prevented', 'voting', 'many', 'whom', 'were', 'African-American', 'African-Americans', 'were', 'also', 'adversely', 'affected', 'polling', 'machines', 'malfunctioned', 'were', 'poorer', 'neighborhoods', 'blacks', 'were', 'more', 'likely', 'inhabit.Democrats', 'asked', 'recount', 'instead', 'asking', 'count', 'entire', 'state', 'Florida', 'better', 'yet', 'have', 'Florida', 'return', 'polls', 'vote', 'again', 'hand-picked', 'certain', 'counties', 'were', 'more', 'likely', 'have', 'voted', 'Gore', 'Democrats', 'had', 'issues', 'military', 'ballots', 'rightly', 'so', 'lacked', 'postmarks', 'made', 'hard', 'determine', 'had', 'been', 'received', 'deadline', 'many', 'military', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'vote', 'Republican', 'arguing', 'disregard', 'votes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tantamount', 'subtracting', 'votes', 'Bush.The', 'official', 'conclusion', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'never', 'really', 'know', 'who', 'won', 'election', '2000', 'seemed', 'unofficial', 'conclusion', 'was', 'Al', 'Gore', 'won', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'was', 'way', 'line', 'giving', 'election', 'Bush', 'easy', 'do', 'when', 'Secretary', 'State', 'was', 'Republican', 'friend', 'fan', 'Texas', 'governor', 'Bush', 'brother', 'was', 'governor', 'Florida', 'Much', 'more', 'disconcerting', 'notion', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'trust', 'polling', 'devices', 'What', 'hell', 'hanging', 'chad', ""'m"", 'American', 'living', 'Canada', 'last', '20', 'years', 'have', 'ballots', 'are', 'very', 'direct', 'just', 'mark', 'X', 'right', 'next', 'person', 'want', 'vote', 'Only', 'one', 'person', 'line', 'way', 'get', 'confused', 'very', 'simple', 'recount', 'hand', 'need.Another', 'unsettling', 'feature', 'movie', 'pop', 'up', 'recent', 'elections', 'population', 'pretty', 'well', 'divided', 'down', 'middle', 'terms', 'two-party', 'system', 'shocking', 'country', '330', 'million', 'people', '*anyone*', 'can', 'win', '1784', 'votes', '324', 'votes', '154', 'votes', 'however', 'way', 'want', 'count', 'fiasco', 'Florida', 'clear', 'presidential', 'victory', 'would', 'have', 'someone', 'winning', 'tens', 'thousands', 'votes', 'least', 'presidents', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'mandate', 'rule', 'are', 'squeaking', 'almost', 'minority', 'governments', 'even', 'split', 'as', 'scary', 'ballot', 'process', 'US']",Recount: The Story Of The 2000 Presidential Election
