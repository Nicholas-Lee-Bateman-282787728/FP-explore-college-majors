I put the HD side through my 42 inch plasma and it looks and sounds magnificent. Some of the scenes were so vibrant and colorful it seemed unreal. Of course it wasn't all spectatcular but there was enough to satisfy me. I agree Planet Earth on HD is a better DVD (set), but it is also a different one. It is geared toward education and has a lot animals scenes. Nature's colors is for relaxing - lovely music accompaniement. Perfect for puttering around the house or sitting with a drink chatting to friends.

That was OK but THIS is the DVD I would most highly recommend.  Sorry for the confusion.Mom Needed Less Anti-anxiety med, February 8, 2010By  Lorilynn ""lorilynn"" (Western Mass.) - See all my reviewsAmazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)I ordered this last year for my mom who was in end-stage Pulmonary Fibrosis. She was so hyper from this disease which robs you of your ability to breath. Very stressful and upsetting for her. She would be in constant motion and non-stop talking mode and when I put this DVD on, all of a sudden she would stop and be mesmerized watching and listening to it. When she got sleepy, she would close her eyes and continue to be soothed by the beautiful classical music. It comforted her so much I think she needed less anti-anxiety medicine because of it. It worked on me a few times too:)After she passed away, we had an old fashioned at home wake for her and played this dvd all the while. Everyone there found it very comforting.I'm back here to get ordering information for a friend who's mom is having some anxiety.I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who loves classical music and scenes of beautiful nature settings.By the way it seems there is some confusion about if this will play in a regular DVD player.  The disc is dual sided.  One side is for HD DVD and the other plays in a regular DVD player just fine.  That's what I have and had no problem with it so unless they changed it it should play.",5,Invaluable to me,1268784000,"03 17, 2010",2010,1509,"['mistakenly', 'posted', 'review', 'product', 'had', 'purchased', 'was', 'OK', 'THIS', 'DVD', 'would', 'most', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Sorry', 'confusion.Mom', 'Needed', 'Less', 'Anti-anxiety', 'med', 'February', '8', '2010By', 'Lorilynn', 'lorilynn', 'Western', 'Mass', 'See', 'reviewsAmazon', 'Verified', 'Purchase', 'What', 'ordered', 'last', 'year', 'mom', 'who', 'was', 'end-stage', 'Pulmonary', 'Fibrosis', 'was', 'so', 'hyper', 'disease', 'robs', 'ability', 'breath', 'Very', 'stressful', 'upsetting', 'would', 'be', 'constant', 'motion', 'non-stop', 'talking', 'mode', 'when', 'put', 'DVD', 'sudden', 'would', 'stop', 'be', 'mesmerized', 'watching', 'listening', 'When', 'got', 'sleepy', 'would', 'close', 'eyes', 'continue', 'be', 'soothed', 'beautiful', 'classical', 'music', 'comforted', 'so', 'much', 'think', 'needed', 'less', 'anti-anxiety', 'medicine', 'worked', 'few', 'times', 'too', 'passed', 'away', 'had', 'old', 'fashioned', 'home', 'wake', 'played', 'dvd', 'while', 'Everyone', 'there', 'found', 'very', 'comforting.I', ""'m"", 'back', 'here', 'get', 'ordering', 'information', 'friend', 'who', 'mom', 'having', 'anxiety.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'classical', 'music', 'scenes', 'beautiful', 'nature', 'settings.By', 'way', 'confusion', 'will', 'play', 'regular', 'DVD', 'player', 'disc', 'dual', 'sided', 'One', 'side', 'HD', 'DVD', 'other', 'plays', 'regular', 'DVD', 'player', 'just', 'fine', 'what', 'have', 'had', 'problem', 'so', 'changed', 'should', 'play']",N/A

What a big disappointment! It simply falls far below of my expectation.Although a step up from standard definition DVD, the transfer has added only some detail and depth, hardly any 3-D effect. Certain scenes are too grainy to my eyes. There's a scene (beach, wave heating the rocks) in the last song..geez...it's blur & worse than a DVD.Some scenes are indeed repetitive.
