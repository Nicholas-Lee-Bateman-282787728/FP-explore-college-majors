1100903,A2ARIZAVTCB6TM,B000VDDE18,Austin114,"[0, 0]","The first time Frasier Crane showed up on Cheers (as Diane's new ex-boyfriend no less), I sized him up and figured he would be around for maybe 6 episodes.After listening to him for a couple of episodes, I actually began to dislike the character immensely and prayed that he would leave.But he quickly grew on me over the years. I think it was about the time Lilith showed up and the two of them began flirting, in that totally-devoid-of-emotion manner that the pair pulled off so well. Lots of successful shows also spawn great spin-offs, but in all my years I have never seen anything like the perfect storm that created ""Fraiser"".When I go back now and watch ""Cheers"", it doesn't seem to me to be as funny as it did when I originally watched it on NBC's killer Thursday night line-up. Who doesn't remember that ratings juggernaut? ""The Cosby Show"", ""Family Ties"", ""Cheers"" & ""Night Court"".""Fraiser"", however, remains one of the outstanding, timeless and classic comedies of all time. How could it go wrong?1. You have the unbelievably wonderful brother Niles, who is like a mirror image of his brother. Indeed, in the first few episodes, Frasier behaves more like the character we know from Cheers. But Niles wears him down, and soon enough that ""every man"" charisma that Frasier spent years building up on Cheers vanishes entirely. ""Let's try a glass of sherry!"" the two brothers decide one night, and it quickly becomes a tradition. As does filing their nails.2. Frasier's troubled relationship with his Dad makes the whole show shine that much brighter. Instead of flying in occasionally from Boston to pay lip service to family, Frasier relocates to Seattle and promptly racks up eleven wonderful years of memories with his father and brother.3. The Niles and Daphne love story is a long simmering, interesting backstory that takes its time playing out, with Maris unexpectedly interfering on a repeated basis even though she NEVER makes an appearance in the series.4. Roz remains one of my favorite characters to this day... although a bit promiscuous, she is the link to Fraiser's new radio show that keeps him balanced with his home life. Most of the ""troubled people"" who call into the radio show are actually really famous celebrities. Sometimes you can clearly recognize them by their voices, and at other times you need to watch the credits at the end of each episode.5. Then there are the regulars from ""Cheers"" who show up from time to time.All in all, this is a comedy unlike any other you will see. It is both a celebration of success in America and a merciless satire of it combined into endless laughs. Whether it be competing for ""Corkmaster"" of their wine club or the complex and utterly disastrous attempt to open a restaurant together, the chaos and laughs that Frasier and Niles bring to our television screen never seem to end. And Frasier's dad surprisingly has even less sympathy for the narcissistic, pompous behavior of his boys. Although he loves them dearly, he never misses an opportunity to point out the complete idiocy of their ""holier than thou"" behavior.I laughed so hard during some of these episodes that I had tears running down my eyes. Here's hoping you pick up this ""complete series"" package at a deep discount and spend your days laughing just as much.It really was a wonderful clique of characters and it really doesn't matter when you watch this series.For people who want television at its best on the shelves of their home collection, this series is a MUST HAVE!",5,An absolute MUST HAVE!,1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,3511,"['first', 'time', 'Frasier', 'Crane', 'showed', 'up', 'Cheers', 'Diane', 'new', 'ex-boyfriend', 'less', 'sized', 'up', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'maybe', '6', 'episodes.After', 'listening', 'couple', 'episodes', 'actually', 'began', 'dislike', 'character', 'immensely', 'prayed', 'would', 'leave.But', 'quickly', 'grew', 'years', 'think', 'was', 'time', 'Lilith', 'showed', 'up', 'two', 'began', 'flirting', 'totally-devoid-of-emotion', 'manner', 'pair', 'pulled', 'off', 'so', 'well', 'Lots', 'successful', 'shows', 'also', 'spawn', 'great', 'spin-offs', 'years', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'perfect', 'storm', 'created', 'Fraiser', '.When', 'go', 'back', 'now', 'watch', 'Cheers', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'as', 'funny', 'did', 'when', 'originally', 'watched', 'NBC', 'killer', 'Thursday', 'night', 'line-up', 'Who', ""n't"", 'remember', 'ratings', 'juggernaut', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Family', 'Ties', 'Cheers', 'Night', 'Court', 'Fraiser', 'however', 'one', 'outstanding', 'timeless', 'classic', 'comedies', 'time', 'How', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', '1', 'have', 'unbelievably', 'wonderful', 'brother', 'Niles', 'who', 'mirror', 'image', 'brother', 'Indeed', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'Frasier', 'more', 'character', 'know', 'Cheers', 'Niles', 'down', 'soon', 'enough', 'man', 'charisma', 'Frasier', 'spent', 'years', 'building', 'up', 'Cheers', 'vanishes', 'entirely', 'Let', 'try', 'glass', 'sherry', 'two', 'brothers', 'decide', 'one', 'night', 'quickly', 'tradition', 'filing', 'nails.2', 'Frasier', 'troubled', 'relationship', 'Dad', 'whole', 'show', 'shine', 'much', 'brighter', 'Instead', 'flying', 'occasionally', 'Boston', 'pay', 'lip', 'service', 'family', 'Frasier', 'Seattle', 'promptly', 'up', 'eleven', 'wonderful', 'years', 'memories', 'father', 'brother.3', 'Niles', 'Daphne', 'love', 'story', 'long', 'simmering', 'interesting', 'backstory', 'time', 'playing', 'out', 'Maris', 'unexpectedly', 'interfering', 'repeated', 'basis', 'even', 'NEVER', 'appearance', 'series.4', 'Roz', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'day', 'bit', 'promiscuous', 'link', 'Fraiser', 'new', 'radio', 'show', 'balanced', 'home', 'life', 'Most', 'troubled', 'people', 'who', 'call', 'radio', 'show', 'are', 'actually', 'really', 'famous', 'celebrities', 'Sometimes', 'can', 'clearly', 'recognize', 'voices', 'other', 'times', 'need', 'watch', 'credits', 'end', 'episode.5', 'Then', 'are', 'regulars', 'Cheers', 'who', 'show', 'up', 'time', 'time.All', 'comedy', 'other', 'will', 'see', 'celebration', 'success', 'America', 'merciless', 'satire', 'combined', 'endless', 'laughs', 'be', 'competing', 'Corkmaster', 'wine', 'club', 'complex', 'utterly', 'disastrous', 'attempt', 'open', 'restaurant', 'together', 'chaos', 'Frasier', 'Niles', 'bring', 'television', 'screen', 'never', 'seem', 'end', 'Frasier', 'dad', 'surprisingly', 'even', 'less', 'sympathy', 'narcissistic', 'pompous', 'behavior', 'boys', 'dearly', 'never', 'opportunity', 'point', 'out', 'complete', 'idiocy', 'holier', 'thou', 'behavior.I', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'episodes', 'had', 'tears', 'running', 'down', 'eyes', 'Here', 'hoping', 'pick', 'up', 'complete', 'series', 'package', 'deep', 'discount', 'spend', 'days', 'laughing', 'just', 'much.It', 'really', 'was', 'wonderful', 'clique', 'characters', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'when', 'watch', 'series.For', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'television', 'best', 'shelves', 'home', 'collection', 'series', 'MUST', 'HAVE']",Frasier: The Complete Series
1100904,A1WOMXOEX90ARI,B000VDDE18,"Avid Camper ""WS""","[97, 100]","We love Frasier!  This show is hilariously funny, mostly fast-moving and so true-to-life.  Never saw many episodes when it first aired, but find it's MUCH better to watch the episodes in order, now that we have the DVD set.  We were hoping the price would go lower; got it for $149 recently.  We don't like the way season two is packaged, it is packaged very differently (cheaper).  Some of the second season discs were dislodged during shipping, as the case doesn't seem to hold them securely.  Overall, we are glad we ordered Frasier, as we all need a little more humor in our lives!  UPDATE:  We're a few seasons in and have discovered one VERY ANNOYING THING about this set.  There are an excessively COPIOUS AMOUNT of other series previews that you must wait for at the start of each disc.  It started with a few and now is up to over 6 minutes worth and growing with each season.  You can not fast forward or skip them and must wait for them each time you turn on the DVD player.  So, every time we want to watch an episode, we must start the DVD player at least 6 minutes before we plan on watching.  This is becoming EXTREMELY AGGRAVATING!!!  We still love Frasier, but would hope this is removed with a new series set.  We would never buy any of those previewed series, as we don't like being forced to watch them on a DVD we paid for and by now, we are thoroughly sick of those previewed series.  Hope this helps!  UPDATE:  After several seasons of watching annoying previews, they seem to be lessening with the later seasons and mostly are confined to the first disc of each season.

I rec'd the set timely, DIRECTLY from Amazon.  I'm on the 7th Season.  I missed this series when it was on originally, so most of the shows I'm watching, I'm seeing for the first time.  IMO, this is one of the best written, well acted, and funniest sitcoms ever.  Some of the shows remind me of the classic I Love Lucy shows.  I have really enjoyed this set of DVDs and don't regret paying this much.  The two or three beginning seasons are packaged differently, but that doesn't bother me.  Still, I wonder, what with the profit the company is making on these things, why not repackage those to look like the others?  As for the ads at the beginning...these appear in mine beginning after several seasons.  I got my set directly from Amazon, not from another seller.  If some sets don't have those, I suspect it's something the manufacturer started doing later, or did before and stopped.  But for those who say their players won't fast forward past them, maybe your SKIP button will work on them.  I have two DVD players:  a Panasonic and a Sony.  The Panasonic is a nice one, but sort of old. The Sony is both somewhat old and didn't cost that much.  Both of them have ""index"" or ""next section"" or ""skip"" buttons.  Those are like fast forward, except the disk will SKIP to the next section of the disk.  I am able to SKIP past each ad to the next, so I just SKIP, and then SKIP, and then SKIP again.  It's an irritation, but most DVDs have ads at the beginning these days, and the SKIP button works well on them.  The SKIP button works in reverse, as well.  Fast forward usu. doesn't work on ads on DVDs for me.The video and audio quality are good. But the show wasn't made in HD, I think. I don't know if shows can be remastered to make them HD if they weren't made that way originally. All I know if the audio and video quality seem good to me for a tv show.  I haven't finished all of the seasons yet, but so far, no bubbles or messed up parts on the disks.  If I encounter that, I will update.UPDATE: I finished all the disks.

""Frasier"" could hardly be called a sequel to ""Cheers"", though, in spite of guest appearances by alumni of that show that appeared pretty regularly in the early years. Frasier's new job on a radio show combined with his neurotic family and friends were a perfect setting for Frasier's trademark sarcasm and biting wit. The show seemed to lose a little steam around the time that Niles' pining away for Daphne actually became a relationship at the end of season seven through the middle of season eight, but the show could have perhaps overcome that had it not been for the tragic death of David Angell on September 11, 2001. Angell was the mastermind behind some of the funnier episodes of ""Cheers"", the creator of the series ""Wings"", and he was the creative force behind ""Frasier"". It just seemed like the show ran out of steam for a couple of seasons after Angell's death, but then came roaring back in its eleventh and final season. That's not to say that seasons nine and ten were bad seasons by network TV standards, they just weren't up to my expectation levels considering how funny and creative the show had been over past years. ""Seinfeld"" and ""Friends"" got more press and had a bigger fan base during the 90's, but Frasier consistently delivered the laughs over the years with a refined and elegant style of humor.Finally I also have to say that I personally loved the character of Eddie from the moment he was introduced on the show after it was decided Martin, Frasier's dad, would be moving in with him. Frasier and Martin are having words over Eddie's presence because Frasier claims ""Eddie stares at me"". Expecting Eddie to be some older male acquaintance, in the next scene I was quite surprised to see Frasier being stared at by Eddie - Martin's Jack Russell terrier. The little dog had a personality of his own and just wasn't window dressing in the series, having a major impact in more than a few episodes and getting more fan mail than any other character on the show.

The big difference between the two is that I actually like Frasier and Niles Crane and wish I knew them as friends.  I really don't want to be friends with the characters on Seinfeld although I find them hilarious.  The genius of FRASIER is the premise of two brothers who are both outstanding psychiatrists in Seattle who have a terrible time with their personal lives.  Neither of them has an easy time with their Dad, a retired, disabled police officer, who now lives with Frasier.  Neither has had good luck with women and that continues for most of the show.  Frasier has been married twice and Niles has an impossible wife at the start of the show and is single not too far into the series.  However, here is the key.  These two really want to be find the love of their lives.  However, they are both so neurotic, so fussy, so bent on disaster, that it is like aiming to pluck a blue moon out of the sky.  Both of them were the kids who never got picked for sports, were bullied in school, wanted but never got the prom queen and so forth and so on.  They are both so fussy about everything that some people assume they are gay instead of straight as they obsess over interior decor, wine, food, designer clothing, opera, and theater.  They are both musical with Frasier singing at every chance (he is better at it in real life than in the show) and Niles playing the piano.  When asked to name their favorite American tv show in the UK, FRASIER took top spot.  This was not faint praise as the UK has excellent tv shows.  Frasier Crane was also a character on CHEERS so I mistakenly started watching CHEERS so I could experience more of Frasier.  This was a mistake because Frasier became a much better character on his own series.  The pairing of Kelsey Grammer (Frasier) with David Hyde-Pierce (Niles) has got to be one of the greatest comedic pairings of all time.  I can't go for long without watching it again.

For Kelsey Gramer to have come off of the 11 season &#34;Cheers&#34; (though hge joined the cast in it's second season, leaving the original; &#34;Sunday In The Park With Goerge&#34; to do so, he played rasier Crame for 20 years. But the true stars here are David Angell, Peter casey and David Lee who developed the show while their suiccesful show &#34;Wings&#34; was still on the air which they developed while their succesful show &#34;cheers' was still on the air. Frasier broke the miold and was one of the last of NBC's &#34;must see TV&#34; stars. (that ended with Will and Grace&#34; and NBC has slipped to the bottom since. &#34;frasier' won Emmhy after Emmy- always beating &#34;riends&#34; largely because of the writing and because they aimed at an intelligent audience. We weren;t told that an episode was modeled after eydeau, but they prooved it was just as popyular. The comedy came from the characters, not situations and the cast was just about the best in television.Grub Street did a great job of bringing in actors for long arcs (Wendie Malick who ended upo marrying Martin) will always be regarded as a lead on Frasier as will Marsha Norman, Feliicity huffman (whose arc and in particular the famous &#34;pictionary&#34; sequence is unorgetable.) Jean Smart will always be a regular and Dan Butler has never been in ANYTHING hwere his finger prints weren't left all over it. Every single meber of the cast was fantastic.. Bebe Neuwirth was a mainstay to the show even on those years where she showed up in only one episodee.The greatest gift is David Hyde Pierce, an acgor of such brilliance that he pulled off a 12 minute scen by himself with no dialouge as he prepared for a Valentine's date that let him face down on Frasierr's birned couch.We watched Jane Leeves grow up as Daphne grew up and we watched the boisterous Peri Gilpin be permitted to show her sentimental side. The story lines were brilliant and though the last three seasons become a little too much regarding Frasier's search for a life-time companion, they at least justified it with a bit of a break down where Frasier goes of to be by himself and invesitgates his mind where Lilith, Diane Chambers, Nanette Gusman and Mother are there in the room with him playing his subconcious.the series ends leaving only one loose end- rasiers, but we see him making a bold hgesture and there is hope, which is what Frasier was always about.Watching Frasier Crame grow from the destroyed mess who swept the bar at Cheers to a comfident man able to sooth and comfort and be very comfortable with who he is was like the best element of this series.You should be forewarned that the first four season do not contain a &#34;play all&#34; option and MANY is the disc I've not boought for this reason. As a result, I often don;t bother with the first three seasons- a pity as the pilot is a work of art.",5,A classic.

I have other favorites, of course, but every time I watch this series, I am reminded of how truly outstanding it is. (Sidenote: I did not like the ""Cheers"" TV show at all, but I absolutely adore ""Frasier."")The casting was spot on, and all the main characters--who are all played by simply brilliant actors--stayed for the full eleven years. They even added new characters (including children) efficiently and seamlessly without giving us the ""Scrappy Doo"" effect and brought in character appearances from ""Cheers"" that worked well. Unlike other shows that went on for a long time, their content never got stale, and I never said to myself, ""They should have ended this show years ago."" (Plus, the writers were pretty consistent in their facts, although I have noticed some inconsistencies because I have no life and have watched the series dozens of times.)The writing is beyond brilliant, the characters grow and mature naturally and meaningfully. The budding romance between Niles and Daphne is done so very well, I just adore the tension and when they finally get together! The ending is really nice and hopeful, even if it doesn't give full closure to the series. It's one of the only shows that has made me laugh out loud in my living room because the combination of the actors' comedic timing and the script is so spot on.This show has such quality that it endears itself to me even more because I really feel like it was a true labor of love for everyone who played a part in making it what it is.Seriously.

A great story line and 5 major actors. It seems that 4 or 5 leading characters makes the perfect sitcom but we should of course mention 'Eddy the dog'. Writing starts well but as usual tends to tail off into disaster by series 9 and revives in the final series. Too much has been written about the basic storyline for me to repeat but I should say that its conclusion in series 12 is a little bizarre. But this is just for fun and I love to watch Frasier at least once a year.

I was a little too young to appreciate all of the play on words and innuendos that each episode contains.Now, I'm a huge Simpsons and Seinfeld fan and I thought, oh yeah Frasier was ok, a good show, but I had never given it the full treatment. A friend of mine mentioned it to me awhile back and it got me thinking. I never really looked into this series on dvd at all.Snagged this set for $125 online (for a legit set yes, after getting scammed for the fake set with the wrong dog on the cover, eventually got a refund, but I digress....)On to the review....The first two seasons are really great from top to bottom. The rest of the seasons are great too, but the show had to grow. The emotional moments are really something. This series, although a comedy, has a lot of heart. You love the characters and root for them to find their place in life.If you love Seinfeld and Cheers this is probably a no brainer. If you saw a few episodes I heartily recommend a thorough a complete series exploration from start to finish.The dvds themselves could have better picture, but it's not like you're expecting a total remaster and if you consider that you can find this set for under $11 a season (each one being 4 discs), it's a bargain to say the least.Really great series, can't say enough.

Video quality is also excellent, especially considering that the oldest episodes were (apparently) not digitally enhanced - as far as I can tell, NONE of the episodes were but the transfers were excellent nonetheless. All 40+ discs play perfectly well. Many of the added special features are quite good. And although Paramount's ""coming attractions,"" starting with the Season Four set, play before the episodes do they CAN be skipped by pressing your remote's Chapter Skip Forward button.Although $200+ is certainly a bit steep for a tv series, considering the total number of discs & episodes along with the generally high quality of the transfers, I'd say the set is a MUST BUY for any Frasier fan. If you enjoy Frasier, just buy the set - you'll not regret it!8/24/2010 - HAD to offer this ""update."" I'd forgotten exactly HOW good this series was. I've got quite the collection of sitcom sets (including Seinfeld and Everybody Loves Ramond, among others) but this one is the TOPS hands-down. It's so good that once you start watching the first episode on a disc you're immediately inclined to watch the rest of them - kind of like reading a book that's so good you just can't put it down until you're either too tired or you know the AM alarm's about to ring... consequently I 'm already through Season Six. Sure the other shows are all top-notch, but this one has the depth, intelligence, heart AND soul that the others seem to come up a bit short on. The stars' superb comical acting skills are all pretty much consistently demonstrated throughout. The ""guest callers"" that are in most all of the episodes and even many of the guest stars collectively constitute a marvelous collage of memorable personalities of the stage, screen and television from decades past (and present). And the incredible Shakespearean and slapstick comedy elements here and there elevate it all to sheer genius. It's no wonder that the show lasted 11 seasons.5 stars all the way!",5,EXCELLENT set!!!,1281312000,"08 9, 2010",2010,2250,"['8/9/2010', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'can', 'possibly', 'complain', 'set', 'Then', 'again', 'purchased', 'set', '*directly*', 'Amazon', 'received', '*precisely*', 'packaging', 'been', 'portrayed', 'here', 'online', 'listing', 'one', 'package/box', 'season', '.Audio', 'quality', 'excellent', 'Video', 'quality', 'also', 'excellent', 'especially', 'considering', 'oldest', 'episodes', 'were', 'apparently', 'not', 'digitally', 'enhanced', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'NONE', 'episodes', 'were', 'transfers', 'were', 'excellent', 'nonetheless', '40+', 'discs', 'play', 'perfectly', 'well', 'Many', 'added', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Paramount', 'coming', 'attractions', 'starting', 'Season', 'Four', 'set', 'play', 'episodes', 'do', 'CAN', 'be', 'skipped', 'pressing', 'remote', 'Chapter', 'Skip', 'Forward', '200+', 'certainly', 'bit', 'steep', 'tv', 'series', 'considering', 'total', 'number', 'discs', 'episodes', 'generally', 'high', 'quality', 'transfers', ""'d"", 'say', 'set', 'MUST', 'BUY', 'Frasier', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'Frasier', 'just', 'buy', 'set', ""'ll"", 'not', 'regret', '8/24/2010', 'HAD', 'offer', 'update', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'exactly', 'HOW', 'good', 'series', 'was', ""'ve"", 'got', 'quite', 'collection', 'sitcom', 'sets', 'including', 'Seinfeld', 'Everybody', 'Loves', 'Ramond', 'others', 'one', 'TOPS', 'hands-down', 'so', 'good', 'once', 'start', 'watching', 'first', 'episode', 'disc', ""'re"", 'immediately', 'inclined', 'watch', 'rest', 'kind', 'reading', 'book', 'so', 'good', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'down', ""'re"", 'too', 'tired', 'know', 'AM', 'alarm', 'ring', 'consequently', ""'m"", 'already', 'Season', 'Six', 'Sure', 'other', 'shows', 'are', 'top-notch', 'one', 'depth', 'intelligence', 'heart', 'AND', 'soul', 'others', 'seem', 'come', 'up', 'bit', 'short', 'stars', 'superb', 'comical', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'consistently', 'demonstrated', 'guest', 'callers', 'are', 'most', 'episodes', 'even', 'many', 'guest', 'stars', 'collectively', 'constitute', 'marvelous', 'collage', 'memorable', 'personalities', 'stage', 'screen', 'television', 'decades', 'present', 'incredible', 'Shakespearean', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'elements', 'here', 'there', 'elevate', 'sheer', 'genius', 'wonder', 'show', 'lasted', '11', 'seasons.5', 'stars', 'way']",Frasier: The Complete Series

Kelsey Grammar is a very talented actor with a Juilliard training and stage presence. He doesn't come across as the sexy leading man but that's okay. Despite his chaotic offscreen life, he breathed Frasier Crane into a likable pompous character that lasted two decades in three different series.When Cheers ended it's run after 11 seasons, Kelsey Grammer's Frasier Crane divorced Lilith Sternin and moved cross country to Seattle, Washington where he became a radio psychiatrist. Once there, he settled into his new bachelor pad until his retired cop father  Martin Crane (played brilliantly by John Mahoney) and his beloved pet dog, Eddie (played by Moose who should have been included in the credits), have to move in with him in his high-rise apartment with a great city view. You just have to love Eddie, Martin's pet dog and best friend. Eddie loves to stare at Frasier for some strange reason.We get to meet Frasier's equally brilliant uptight and high society brother, Niles Crane (played brilliantly by David Hyde-Pierce), who is also a psychiatrist and looks down upon Frasier's gig at the radio station. Niles is married to unseen Maris, a high society doyenne of Seattle. Then there is Roz Doyle, Frasier's radio producer. Roz is perfectly played by Peri Gilpin who replaced Lisa Kudrow in the role. Probably a better choice for this character.  Niles can't help but be attracted to his father's physical therapist, Daphne Moon (played by Jane Leeves) despite being married to Maris.There are other characters in the eleven year series. I'm enjoying watching the episodes on television but I would love to have all of them on DVD. The series was well-written, smart, and didn't dumb itself down at times to appease the audience. The series never had the bathroom humor injected in today's shows. Frasier lasted 11 seasons and it's a great ride for the cast and crew.Unfortunately on September 11, 2001, series creator and writer, David Angell, and his wife Lynn Angell were returning to Los Angeles, California for the primetime Emmys when they were aboard American Flight 11 that crashed into the first World Trade Center on that day killing them and thousands of others. Still, the series kept going despite the devastating loss of such a talented man.
