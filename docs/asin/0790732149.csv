99015,A26R4PDCZX5SOK,0790732149,"Amazon Customer ""The World According to JimG944""","[2, 2]","3 of 5 stars for the drama movie Murder at 1600. A solid good movie richly photographed. The story opens with a murder in the White House. When the local police arrive the ""coverup"" starts. The local police detective is played by one of my favorite actors Wesley Snipes. As the investigation progresses, we start learning of missing information and false leads. On the surface, it looks like an odd murder; deeper we learn that it is a plot to ultimately force the president to resign. So the movie is interesting with several surprises and plot twists. My only complaint is that it is a long movie considering its contents. I could probably cut 30 minutes from it and make it move faster; each scene is about 10 seconds longer than it needs to be. Good direction, weak editing in post-production. OK, so I do like this movie and I do recommend it.",3,Murder at the White House is not what it appears,1256083200,"10 21, 2009",2009,848,"['3', '5', 'stars', 'drama', 'movie', 'Murder', '1600', 'solid', 'good', 'movie', 'richly', 'photographed', 'story', 'murder', 'White', 'House', 'When', 'local', 'police', 'arrive', 'coverup', 'starts', 'local', 'police', 'detective', 'played', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'investigation', 'start', 'learning', 'missing', 'information', 'false', 'leads', 'surface', 'odd', 'murder', 'learn', 'plot', 'ultimately', 'force', 'president', 'resign', 'movie', 'interesting', 'several', 'surprises', 'plot', 'twists', 'only', 'complaint', 'long', 'movie', 'considering', 'contents', 'could', 'probably', 'cut', '30', 'minutes', 'make', 'move', 'faster', 'scene', '10', 'seconds', 'longer', 'be', 'Good', 'direction', 'weak', 'editing', 'post-production', 'OK', 'do', 'movie', 'do', 'recommend']",Murder at 1600

There is some sexual tension between Wesley Snipes and Diane Lane and Alan Alda is cast against type as a villian.  Daniel J. Travanti is also fine.  The plot is actually fairly predictable.  I like Wesley Snipes as an actor but this is not his finest role.  He plays a D. C. homocide detective who has to investigate the murder of a staffer that occurs in the White House. Of course, his investigation causes him to bump heads with the White House chief of staff, Travanti and other bureaucrats including the Secret Service. Some of the plot twists are a little far fetched as Diane Lane character being an excellent marksman who won gold at the Olympics.I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it but also, as with most films set in Washington, D. C. the geography is not quite right.  This movie does have some humor as the fact that Wesley Snipes is about to be evicted from his home by some government agency and the tenants in the building think that as a detective, he could influence the eviction.If this movie was coming out now, I do not know if it would be worth the price of a ticket at the multiplex but to rent it and watch it at home would be fine. Especially if you are a fan of Snipes, Alda, or Diane Lane.  They are all fine.  The movie could have been a bit better written.  Dennis Miller is Snipes partner but he comes and goes in the movie and this hurts his overall impact in the film. The actor who plays the president seems a little weak to actually be a president.

99023,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,0790732149,C. O. DeRiemer,"[0, 0]","Murder at 1600 starts with all the clever thriller set-ups and intriguing plot grabbers of slick Hollywood at its best. It ends with all the pointless, clich&eacute;-ridden thriller hokum of slick Hollywood at its worst. What makes it work as well as it does is the appealing, intelligent performance of Wesley Snipes, an actor whose career has disintegrated into pointless, second-rate macho movies. Most of Murder at 1600 is an exciting ride, and I always enjoy boarding the roller coaster. Finally reaching the destination, however, is a yawn.It's all about the body of a young woman, one of the secretaries, discovered in a White House bathroom. Detective Harlan Regis (Snipes) of the D. C. Police Department is assigned to investigate. The head of the White House Secret Service detail, Nick Spikings (Daniel Benzali), isn't having any of that. The White House is his turf. Matters get complicated when the murdered woman is identified as the girl friend of the President's son. She might even have been the girlfriend of the President. Regis makes clear he's not going away. Spikings assigns one of his team to work with Regis. She's Agent Nina Chance (Diane Lane), small, highly attractive and, more to the point, smart. She's also a sharp shooter. That's a talent that will come in handy later. But is she assigned to help Regis or to spy on him and report back to Spikings?Will this be an investigation of a murder or a cover-up for a murderer? Or is the murder part of something worse...something like, say, an incursion into North Korea? What we quickly realize is that Benzali and Alan Alda, as National Security Advisor Alvin Jordan, are going to chew the scenery. By the time this complicated, high-potential mystery movie limps to its conclusion, we will have spent most of the time enjoying Wesley Snipe's charm and resourcefulness as he unthreads a conspiracy. Diane Lane's talent as an intelligent sidekick with great legs is not to be sniffed at, either. Of course, Hollywood also gives us a few nearly unkillable hit men who pop up here and there, a convenient tunnel to the White House, explosions, helicopters, car chases, kicks, grunts, the inaccurate idea that the FBI doesn't have jurisdiction over crimes committed on federal property (no big deal, some producer probably said) and a climax in the White House that involves a lot of people, including the President. But that's Hollywood big-ticket show biz.After Murder at 1600 Snipes seems to have decided that he wanted to be one of the big, macho, impervious Hollywood hero types, the kind who star in big-budget flicks aimed for the 16- through 26-year-old crowd...the kind of movies that feature awesome explosions and mano-a-mano fights with evil. Snipes was a good actor once. Don't know what happened, but Snipes personally and professionally seems to have taken the long drop.At any rate, I still enjoy Murder at 1600, and I like Snipes' performance so well I can even get past the last 25 minutes. He was one of several actors who made vivid impressions in the great, oddKing of New York (Special Edition). In a sidekick role, he nearly edged Sean Connery off stage center inRising Sun, and he proved he could handle comedy easily inWhite Men Can't Jump.",4,"Snipes is great, but what starts as a fine political thriller just ends up with explosions, grunting fights and snipers",1228694400,"12 8, 2008",2008,3240,"['Murder', '1600', 'starts', 'clever', 'thriller', 'set-ups', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'grabbers', 'slick', 'Hollywood', 'best', 'pointless', 'clich', 'eacute', '-ridden', 'thriller', 'hokum', 'slick', 'Hollywood', 'worst', 'What', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'appealing', 'intelligent', 'performance', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'actor', 'career', 'disintegrated', 'pointless', 'second-rate', 'macho', 'movies', 'Most', 'Murder', '1600', 'exciting', 'ride', 'always', 'enjoy', 'boarding', 'roller', 'coaster', 'Finally', 'reaching', 'destination', 'however', 'yawn.It', 'body', 'young', 'woman', 'one', 'secretaries', 'discovered', 'White', 'House', 'bathroom', 'Detective', 'Harlan', 'Regis', 'Snipes', 'D.', 'C.', 'Police', 'Department', 'assigned', 'investigate', 'head', 'White', 'House', 'Secret', 'Service', 'detail', 'Nick', 'Spikings', 'Daniel', 'Benzali', ""n't"", 'having', 'White', 'House', 'turf', 'Matters', 'get', 'complicated', 'when', 'murdered', 'woman', 'identified', 'girl', 'friend', 'President', 'son', 'might', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'girlfriend', 'President', 'Regis', 'clear', 'not', 'going', 'away', 'Spikings', 'one', 'team', 'work', 'Regis', 'Agent', 'Nina', 'Chance', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'small', 'highly', 'attractive', 'more', 'point', 'smart', 'also', 'sharp', 'shooter', 'talent', 'will', 'come', 'handy', 'later', 'assigned', 'help', 'Regis', 'spy', 'report', 'back', 'Spikings', 'Will', 'be', 'investigation', 'murder', 'cover-up', 'murderer', 'murder', 'part', 'something', 'worse', 'something', 'say', 'incursion', 'North', 'Korea', 'What', 'quickly', 'realize', 'Benzali', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'National', 'Security', 'Advisor', 'Alvin', 'Jordan', 'are', 'going', 'chew', 'scenery', 'time', 'complicated', 'high-potential', 'mystery', 'movie', 'conclusion', 'will', 'have', 'spent', 'most', 'time', 'enjoying', 'Wesley', 'Snipe', 'charm', 'resourcefulness', 'conspiracy', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'talent', 'intelligent', 'sidekick', 'great', 'legs', 'not', 'be', 'sniffed', 'course', 'Hollywood', 'also', 'few', 'nearly', 'unkillable', 'hit', 'men', 'who', 'pop', 'up', 'here', 'there', 'convenient', 'tunnel', 'White', 'House', 'explosions', 'helicopters', 'car', 'chases', 'kicks', 'grunts', 'inaccurate', 'idea', 'FBI', ""n't"", 'have', 'jurisdiction', 'crimes', 'committed', 'federal', 'property', 'big', 'deal', 'producer', 'probably', 'said', 'climax', 'White', 'House', 'lot', 'people', 'including', 'President', 'Hollywood', 'big-ticket', 'show', 'biz.After', 'Murder', '1600', 'Snipes', 'have', 'decided', 'wanted', 'be', 'one', 'big', 'macho', 'impervious', 'Hollywood', 'hero', 'types', 'kind', 'who', 'big-budget', 'flicks', 'aimed', '16-', '26-year-old', 'crowd', 'kind', 'movies', 'feature', 'awesome', 'explosions', 'mano-a-mano', 'fights', 'evil', 'Snipes', 'was', 'good', 'actor', 'once', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Snipes', 'personally', 'professionally', 'have', 'taken', 'long', 'drop.At', 'rate', 'still', 'enjoy', 'Murder', '1600', 'like', 'Snipes', 'performance', 'so', 'well', 'can', 'even', 'get', 'last', '25', 'minutes', 'was', 'one', 'several', 'actors', 'who', 'made', 'vivid', 'impressions', 'great', 'oddKing', 'New', 'York', 'Special', 'Edition', 'sidekick', 'role', 'nearly', 'edged', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'stage', 'center', 'inRising', 'Sun', 'proved', 'could', 'handle', 'comedy', 'easily', 'inWhite', 'Men', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Jump']",Murder at 1600

99026,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0790732149,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[25, 27]","Once again I find myself praising a movie that a majority of folks seem to view as average at best.  Murder at 1600 is a serious movie that you can't take too seriously, not if you want to enjoy it.  Wesley Snipes has a few humorous bits, and Dennis Miller is his normally wisecracking self, and I think the movie perhaps benefits from this remote air of unreality due to its subject matter - after all, the brutal murder of a young woman inside the White House is some pretty serious stuff.  The other main aspect of the film, which supplies the motive for the murder in the first place, is - granted - a little bit out there, and that is where the subtle sense of unreality pays dividends; without it, it would really be hard to get from here to there.Carla Towne is a young unknown White House staffer - until her body is found in a White House restroom sporting a number of deadly knife wounds.  This is not good news for the President, who is already bottoming out in the polls for still attempting to negotiate, six months into the crisis, the release of an AWAC crew captured and obviously tortured by the North Koreans.  Wesley Snipes plays Detective Harlan Regis, the investigator summoned to the White House to investigate the murder.  The Secret Service as an organization is less than friendly and cooperative, viewing the White House as its beat alone.  Except for his buddy and sometimes partner (played by Dennis Miller), Regis is pretty much on his own.  The tight-lipped and intimidating Nick Spikings (Daniel Benzali), the chief of White House security and definite contender for the next Lex Luthor look-alike contest (his Marlon Brando impersonation isn't half bad, either) assigns Agent Nina Chance (Diane Lane) as Regis' liaison with the Secret Service.  Spikings doesn't mess around, and once he has tabbed an individual for the murder, he wants Chance to have nothing to do with Regis.  The detective is pretty persistent, though, and Chance has to weigh her sense of duty against her sense of justice.The list of suspects is quite fluid, and I think the movie does a very good job of sustaining suspense and the sense of mystery throughout.  The facts as Regis acquires them make not only the President's philandering son, but the President himself possible suspects.  Then you have the crisis with North Korea coming to the fore, with the President really frustrating his top advisors with his incredibly wimpy refusal to risk war with North Korea over the military hostage crisis.  The truth, when it comes, does push the envelope to some degree, but it is certainly logical in the given context.  I didn't ID the real bad guy any sooner than Regis and Chance did, so that to me is a good thing.A great mystery, plenty of action, power politics, lust, murder, conspiracy inside conspiracy: Murder in 1600 offers the viewers all of this and more.  The ending itself is well done in my opinion, as well.  Thus, this reviewer counts this as an impressive and very entertaining thriller.",5,"An impressive, tantalizing thriller",1080345600,"03 27, 2004",2004,3010,"['Once', 'again', 'find', 'praising', 'movie', 'majority', 'folks', 'seem', 'view', 'average', 'best', 'Murder', '1600', 'serious', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'not', 'want', 'enjoy', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'few', 'humorous', 'bits', 'Dennis', 'Miller', 'normally', 'wisecracking', 'self', 'think', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'benefits', 'remote', 'air', 'unreality', 'due', 'subject', 'matter', 'brutal', 'murder', 'young', 'woman', 'White', 'House', 'pretty', 'serious', 'stuff', 'other', 'main', 'aspect', 'film', 'motive', 'murder', 'first', 'place', 'granted', 'little', 'bit', 'there', 'where', 'subtle', 'sense', 'unreality', 'pays', 'dividends', 'would', 'really', 'be', 'hard', 'get', 'here', 'there.Carla', 'Towne', 'young', 'unknown', 'White', 'House', 'staffer', 'body', 'found', 'White', 'House', 'restroom', 'sporting', 'number', 'deadly', 'knife', 'wounds', 'not', 'good', 'news', 'President', 'who', 'already', 'bottoming', 'out', 'polls', 'still', 'attempting', 'negotiate', 'six', 'months', 'crisis', 'release', 'AWAC', 'crew', 'captured', 'obviously', 'tortured', 'North', 'Koreans', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Detective', 'Harlan', 'Regis', 'investigator', 'summoned', 'White', 'House', 'investigate', 'murder', 'Secret', 'Service', 'organization', 'less', 'friendly', 'cooperative', 'viewing', 'White', 'House', 'beat', 'alone', 'buddy', 'sometimes', 'partner', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Miller', 'Regis', 'pretty', 'much', 'own', 'tight-lipped', 'intimidating', 'Nick', 'Spikings', 'Daniel', 'Benzali', 'chief', 'White', 'House', 'security', 'definite', 'contender', 'next', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'look-alike', 'contest', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'impersonation', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', 'either', 'Agent', 'Nina', 'Chance', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Regis', 'liaison', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Spikings', ""n't"", 'mess', 'once', 'tabbed', 'individual', 'murder', 'Chance', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'Regis', 'detective', 'pretty', 'persistent', 'Chance', 'weigh', 'sense', 'duty', 'sense', 'justice.The', 'list', 'suspects', 'quite', 'fluid', 'think', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'sustaining', 'suspense', 'sense', 'mystery', 'facts', 'Regis', 'make', 'not', 'only', 'President', 'philandering', 'son', 'President', 'possible', 'suspects', 'Then', 'have', 'crisis', 'North', 'Korea', 'coming', 'fore', 'President', 'really', 'frustrating', 'top', 'advisors', 'incredibly', 'wimpy', 'refusal', 'risk', 'war', 'North', 'Korea', 'military', 'hostage', 'crisis', 'truth', 'when', 'push', 'envelope', 'degree', 'certainly', 'logical', 'given', 'context', 'did', ""n't"", 'ID', 'real', 'bad', 'guy', 'sooner', 'Regis', 'Chance', 'did', 'good', 'thing.A', 'great', 'mystery', 'plenty', 'action', 'power', 'politics', 'lust', 'murder', 'conspiracy', 'conspiracy', 'Murder', '1600', 'viewers', 'more', 'ending', 'well', 'done', 'opinion', 'as', 'well', 'Thus', 'reviewer', 'impressive', 'very', 'entertaining', 'thriller']",Murder at 1600

The detective finds that this being a case which can affect the politics of the Presidency. he is forced to take short-cuts to try to do his job. We are also treated to the in-fighting within the inner circle of advisors to the President as to the policy to be  pursued to get back from the North Koreans American servicemen who were on a plane that came down in their territory.You will enjoy this melange of ""it can't really happen"" if you are simply able to identify with the police officer and go along with the politics regardless of any doubts you may have about the their reality or possibility. You may also have some doubts that security  at the White House is quite what it is made out to be in crucial scenes of the movie.I enjoyed the movie for its action which is the heart of it.

Snipes begins to realize that there is a coverup in progress and that he is only one man standing against the machinery of Washington.  Snipes is a good fit for this role, not relying on simply mugging and attitude like he sometimes does.  Diane Lane as the Secret Service agent assigned as his liason gives the film's best performance.  She really deserves to get her ""breakout"" role that would give her a shot at better scripts than this one.  It starts out promisingly, but the mystery and action becomes increasingly ridiculous as it moves along.

At first he thinks it has to be a joke until he sees the dead body in the restroom that one of the maids found.  After all who expects to find a beautiful blond woman who is dead in the restroom down the hall from the oval office at the White House and 40 yards from the Presidents bedroom?The woman was a 24 year old, Carla Town, and she has been dead for about 3 hours.  The first family is at Camp David since the day before.  Harlan is wanted about as much in the White House as someone with a contagious disease.  Key White House staff members are arguing who is in case of the investigation.  The White house Secret Service Chief and the National Security Advisor are arguing who is in charge of a murder case.Nina Chance (Diane Lane) is a liaison assigned to work with Harlan; she is a Secret Service Agent.  They go to Carla's apartment and it looks sanitized as the feds had arrived 15 minutes after they found the body the night before.  All of the photos are missing from her photo album.  Harlan found a receipt ticket in a magazine and keeps the evidence....The USA in already under stress and American soldiers are being held hostage in North Korea.  The President is saying to have patience.  His entire staff is against him in how he is handling the situation.What follows is an intense film with everyone considered a suspect.  Were there 30 or 31 people in the White House that night?  Harlan doesn't know because he is being feed half-truths and lies.  The only straight information he is getting is from Nina.  Harlan is moving in power circles and at events way over his status and he fights to do the right thing and not be intimidated.This story is about a power struggle at the top of the American political scene and Harlan is trapped in the middle while trying to find out the truth and not be accused of being a traitor to America.

Under the eternally captured eyes of Washington and Jefferson, a lovely young blonde is having sex in one of the rooms in the White House.  Soon a maid discovers her body in a stall in the restroom.  She has been stabbed to death.  Uh-oh, is this going to be a problem or what?MURDER AT 1600 has a lot of incredible plot contrivances that don't work unless you go ahead, suspend your belief, and enjoy the ride.  Dwight Little's competent direction allows us to do that.  Remember, it's just a movie, and even though its plot seems a bit far-fetched at times, it works as an engrossing thriller.  Wesley Snipes is convincing as a no-nonsense DC homicide detective who forces himself onto the investigation, which should have been federally handled since it took place on Federal property.  But then we wouldn't have had a movie.  Diane Lane in a rare ""action"" role is marvelous as Dena Chance, the secret service liaison who realizes a cover up is going on.
