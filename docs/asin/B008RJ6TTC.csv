1574556,ADLVFFE4VBT8,B008RJ6TTC,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[1, 1]","Okay, I will confess: this is not my fir Columbo collection. I've bought the individual seasons previously but one DVD got stuck in an old player and it went with it because we forgot it was there and a few were skipping or freezing and no matter how many times we cleaned them, the skipping and freezing was coming back after a while. Not to mention that some of the movies I never had. So I HAD to get 'The Complete Series' because Columbo is such a special show: amazingly innovative at the time and still holding strong and very much watchable after all these years.There are many 'old shows' out on DVD these days but Columbo's stand out not only because they were on an unusual 'long' format and most of them followed the unusual Columbo-branded script where the we start by witnessing the crime and then we watch Columbo solving it but also because of the outstanding quality of the DVD rendition. From 'episode one' of 'season one', the picture is crisp and bright, the colors are vibrant and the sound is clear, they almost have a digital quality which makes watching these 30-40+ year old episodes a pleasure to watch.And, yes, not everything is to everybody's liking. This collection has near-zero extras that's not on the DVDs themselves. There are no glossy inserts and even the episodes' names can't be seen unless you look at the interior cover and you will usually have to remove the first or the last disc to access them. No huge deal but, yeah, it's a small inconvenience.Overall, I am simply thrilled to finally have all of Columbo in one box and I highly recommend this to anyone who remembers the old shows or the relatively more recent Columbo mystery movies an ABC and to anyone who would be interested in watching one of the greatest detective TV series ever made. Oh, by the way, the ABC Columbo movies are rendered in a 'wide screen' format so if you watched the movies 'then' on an old TV, you are going to see more of it now.",5,The Complete Columbo,1385078400,"11 22, 2013",2013,1953,"['Okay', 'will', 'confess', 'not', 'fir', 'Columbo', 'collection', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'individual', 'seasons', 'previously', 'one', 'DVD', 'got', 'stuck', 'old', 'player', 'went', 'forgot', 'was', 'there', 'few', 'were', 'skipping', 'freezing', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'cleaned', 'skipping', 'freezing', 'was', 'coming', 'back', 'while', 'Not', 'mention', 'movies', 'never', 'had', 'So', 'HAD', 'get', ""'The"", 'Complete', 'Series', 'Columbo', 'such', 'special', 'show', 'amazingly', 'innovative', 'time', 'still', 'holding', 'strong', 'very', 'much', 'watchable', 'are', 'many', ""'old"", 'shows', 'out', 'DVD', 'days', 'Columbo', 'stand', 'not', 'only', 'were', 'unusual', ""'long"", 'format', 'most', 'followed', 'unusual', 'Columbo-branded', 'script', 'where', 'start', 'witnessing', 'crime', 'then', 'watch', 'Columbo', 'solving', 'also', 'outstanding', 'quality', 'DVD', 'rendition', ""'episode"", 'one', ""'season"", 'one', 'picture', 'crisp', 'bright', 'colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'sound', 'clear', 'almost', 'have', 'digital', 'quality', 'watching', '30-40+', 'year', 'old', 'pleasure', 'watch.And', 'yes', 'not', 'everything', 'everybody', 'liking', 'collection', 'near-zero', 'extras', 'not', 'DVDs', 'are', 'glossy', 'inserts', 'even', 'episodes', 'names', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'seen', 'look', 'interior', 'cover', 'will', 'usually', 'have', 'remove', 'first', 'last', 'disc', 'access', 'huge', 'deal', 'yeah', 'small', 'inconvenience.Overall', 'am', 'simply', 'thrilled', 'finally', 'have', 'Columbo', 'one', 'box', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'old', 'shows', 'relatively', 'more', 'recent', 'Columbo', 'mystery', 'movies', 'ABC', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'watching', 'one', 'greatest', 'detective', 'TV', 'series', 'ever', 'made', 'Oh', 'way', 'ABC', 'Columbo', 'movies', 'are', 'rendered', ""'wide"", 'screen', 'format', 'watched', 'movies', ""'then"", 'old', 'TV', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'more', 'now']",N/A

I'll have to say I'm pleasantly surprised.Not all transfers of older TV shows come off well, but this one is excellent. The picture is sharp, with vibrant colors. The picture is so sharp that it even looks good without setting the TV's display ratio to 4:3, which for many older shows is an absolute requirement to get the best image. The sound is accurate without distortion, though at times it will drop out for a second. If there is a quibble, it is that there is film damage occasionally evident in the presence of little flickers of spots.All of the original Columbo mystery movies are included in the set ... even the original movie made and aired years before the series started. Plus all of the later special TV movies are in the set. So if it's Columbo, it's here.While I always enjoyed Columbo myself, I'll admit that I often had to take him in small doses. LOL I like Peter Falk, I like the mysteries and the writing, I like the guest stars, but sometimes I sort of wished that the murderer would pull out a gun and end Columbo's endless nagging. :-) Often the guest star murderer was a much more entertaining and sympathetic character than Columbo, and if they didn't start out that way, you certainly had some sympathy for them before the movie was over.

One of the Columbo movies left nothing to the imagination.  I would have been sick if I had watched one with anybody else in the room.

""Why not?"" I thought. ""For old times' sake! What does it matter if the series is a bit old fashioned?""Well, about the only old-fashioned thing about this quality detective series are the cars which, rather appropriately, resemble huge moving coffins (I am, of course, overlooking the telephones, the hairstyles and other tell-tale signs of the 'seventies). Having watched only the first four episodes, so far, I am happy as a couple of clams, and I cannot believe my luck at having acquired such a great pearl at so little a price.So what's to love in these mysteries that are not so much ""Who-Done-It?"" as ""How-Done-It?"" Well, just about everything. I love the subtle comedy--Columbo, for instance, fumbling about in the background, dropping things or fiddling with his cigar, trying to find a match, or a pen--as the slick murderer, whose arrogance is his/her undoing, becomes increasingly irritated, while Columbo--the eternal schlub--inevitably closes in. I also love the touches of surrealism (for instance, watching the coverup of the murder take place through the reflection of Robert Culp's glasses--and I can hardly wait for the episode in which Columbo--closing in on a homicidal artist--becomes part of the painting).The casts are simply to die for. In addition to Peter Falk's underplayed over-playing of the title role, we have A-list actors, including Culp, Ray Milland, Lee Grant for starters), and the various guest directors (including Stephen Spielberg) are splendid, as are the opulent settings. The murderers always come from the top drawer of wealth, and it is so much fun to watch them being brought low by the scruffy Lieutenant Columbo, who, pestering them with ""just one more thing,"" drives all the villains to the point of distraction, before he closes in on them.In abstract terms, Columbo portrays the triumph of the little man over the great and powerful, a potent image in tough economic times. In concrete terms, Columbo rewards the viewer with pure enjoyment and entertainment: the gold standard of television that, unfortunately, seems to have vanished along with the economy.How lucky we are to have this collection!P.S.

1574612,A3VNNI6PFNK901,B008RJ6TTC,J. Gibson,"[0, 0]","I'll be the first to admit that I am greatly biased toward Columbo.  I absolutely adore the late, great Peter Falk and have been a fan of his most famous character since childhood.  There really isn't much one can say negative about this series except that with just 69, there were too few episodes/movies!Peter Falk was always brilliant in everything he was in.  He was equally as comfortable in a flat-out comedy role as he was drama.  He brought all of his characters to life and you cared about them because they had that something special that a truly good character always does.Lt. Frank Columbo was no exception to that.The good Lt. always had an idea from the start who the murderer was.  The joy of each episode was watching him expertly lead the killer into giving him/herself away.  It didn't matter how carefully they thought they had planned out the crime, once Columbo was on the case, he would exploit their greatest weaknesses and end up letting the bad guy catch himself.Along the way, there was a lot of humor to lighten the atmosphere, but the shows never turned into a comedy.  Let's face it, murder isn't exactly a light-hearted thing so it can always be welcome when our hero can bring a smile into an otherwise dark situation.  Whether it was always commenting on what he and Mrs. Columbo enjoyed or liked (Mrs. Columbo has to have had some of the most eclectic interests and tastes of any human being as she was a fan of everyone and everything!), Columbo whistling &#34;This Old Man&#34; or even bringing Dog along on the investigation, he could always make you smile.  Rarely did he lose his temper and even when he did, you couldn't fault him for it.The &#34;Columbo&#34; series can also boast something that so precious few series of today can:  superior writing.  A good mystery is nothing if the writing is poor and doesn't have the characters to back it up.  The crimes in &#34;Columbo&#34; were unique for their time and kept you on your toes looking for that one thing that told Lt. Columbo that his prime suspect was guilty.  The supporting characters were just as well-written as the regular series characters.  None of them were there just for the sake of bringing in a big name guest star.  They had background and could be pretty complex.And about those guest stars.  Some of the biggest and best names in Hollywood were on the receiving end of Lt. Columbo's razor-sharp wit or were the victim he fought so hard to find justice for.  Leonard Nemoy, George Hamilton, Patrick McGoohan (he also directed five episodes), Robert Culp, Robert Vaughn, William Shatner, Jeanette Nolan, Ray Milland, Jack Cassidy, Ida Lupino, John Dehner, Leslie Neilson, Dean Stockwell, Dabney Coleman and dozens of others.  To say &#34;Columbo&#34; was 'star-studded' would be an understatement.  We even get to see Peter Falk's real-life wife, Shera Danese in six episodes.Along with well-known actors and actresses, some of the cream of the Hollywood crop worked behind the scenes.  Steven Speilberg, Steven Bochco and Johnathan Demme served in roles of directors and writers.  Two of the episodes were based upon two of Ed McBain's &#34;87th Precinct&#34; novels.  Even Peter Falk himself served a double role as actor and director for the last episode of the first season.  Henry Mancini and Mike Post were two of the many, and very talented, composers who worked on the show.  Over the course of its run, Columbo won thirteen Emmys and two each of Edgar Awards and Golden Globes.  Well deserved recognition for such a fine show!There is a reason why &#34;Columbo&#34; ran from 1968 to 2003.  The quality of the acting and writing was top-notch,  The story lines were unique and compelling.  It was a pleasure to learn a new Columbo movie was on the network schedule because you knew that the two hours you would spend watching the show meant a great way to spend an evening with good entertainment that challenged your mind.Oh, and just one more thing...you'll really regret it if you don't add this brilliant complete series to your DVD collection.  Anyone who is a fan of well-written, brilliantly acted drama would be proud to own this collection!",5,Just About As Perfect as a Series Can Get,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,4169,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'am', 'greatly', 'biased', 'Columbo', 'absolutely', 'adore', 'late', 'great', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'most', 'famous', 'character', 'childhood', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'negative', 'series', 'just', '69', 'were', 'too', 'few', 'episodes/movies', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'was', 'always', 'brilliant', 'everything', 'was', 'was', 'equally', 'comfortable', 'flat-out', 'comedy', 'role', 'was', 'drama', 'brought', 'characters', 'life', 'cared', 'had', 'something', 'special', 'truly', 'good', 'character', 'always', 'does.Lt', 'Frank', 'Columbo', 'was', 'exception', 'that.The', 'good', 'Lt.', 'always', 'had', 'idea', 'start', 'who', 'murderer', 'was', 'joy', 'episode', 'was', 'watching', 'expertly', 'lead', 'killer', 'giving', 'away', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'carefully', 'thought', 'had', 'planned', 'out', 'crime', 'once', 'Columbo', 'was', 'case', 'would', 'exploit', 'greatest', 'weaknesses', 'end', 'up', 'letting', 'bad', 'guy', 'catch', 'himself.Along', 'way', 'was', 'lot', 'humor', 'lighten', 'atmosphere', 'shows', 'never', 'turned', 'comedy', 'Let', 'face', 'murder', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'light-hearted', 'thing', 'can', 'always', 'be', 'welcome', 'when', 'hero', 'can', 'bring', 'smile', 'otherwise', 'dark', 'situation', 'was', 'always', 'commenting', 'what', 'Mrs.', 'Columbo', 'enjoyed', 'liked', 'Mrs.', 'Columbo', 'have', 'had', 'most', 'eclectic', 'interests', 'tastes', 'human', 'being', 'was', 'fan', 'everyone', 'everything', 'Columbo', 'whistling', '34', 'Old', 'Man', '34', 'even', 'bringing', 'Dog', 'investigation', 'could', 'always', 'make', 'smile', 'Rarely', 'did', 'lose', 'temper', 'even', 'when', 'did', 'could', ""n't"", 'fault', 'it.The', '34', 'Columbo', '34', 'series', 'can', 'also', 'boast', 'something', 'so', 'precious', 'few', 'series', 'today', 'can', 'superior', 'writing', 'good', 'mystery', 'nothing', 'writing', 'poor', ""n't"", 'have', 'characters', 'back', 'up', 'crimes', '34', 'Columbo', '34', 'were', 'unique', 'time', 'kept', 'toes', 'looking', 'one', 'thing', 'told', 'Lt.', 'Columbo', 'prime', 'suspect', 'was', 'guilty', 'supporting', 'characters', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'well-written', 'regular', 'series', 'characters', 'None', 'were', 'there', 'just', 'sake', 'bringing', 'big', 'name', 'guest', 'star', 'had', 'background', 'could', 'be', 'pretty', 'complex.And', 'guest', 'stars', 'biggest', 'best', 'names', 'Hollywood', 'were', 'receiving', 'end', 'Lt.', 'Columbo', 'razor-sharp', 'wit', 'were', 'victim', 'fought', 'so', 'hard', 'find', 'justice', 'Leonard', 'Nemoy', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'also', 'directed', 'five', 'episodes', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Jeanette', 'Nolan', 'Ray', 'Milland', 'Jack', 'Cassidy', 'Ida', 'Lupino', 'John', 'Dehner', 'Leslie', 'Neilson', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'dozens', 'others', 'say', '34', 'Columbo', '34', 'was', ""'star-studded"", 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'even', 'get', 'see', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Shera', 'Danese', 'six', 'episodes.Along', 'well-known', 'actors', 'actresses', 'cream', 'Hollywood', 'crop', 'worked', 'scenes', 'Steven', 'Speilberg', 'Steven', 'Bochco', 'Johnathan', 'Demme', 'served', 'roles', 'directors', 'writers', 'Two', 'episodes', 'were', 'based', 'two', 'Ed', 'McBain', '34', '87th', 'Precinct', '34', 'novels', 'Even', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'served', 'double', 'role', 'actor', 'director', 'last', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'Mike', 'Post', 'were', 'two', 'many', 'very', 'talented', 'composers', 'who', 'worked', 'show', 'course', 'run', 'Columbo', 'won', 'thirteen', 'Emmys', 'two', 'Edgar', 'Awards', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'Well', 'deserved', 'recognition', 'fine', 'show', 'reason', 'why', '34', 'Columbo', '34', 'ran', '1968', '2003', 'quality', 'acting', 'writing', 'was', 'top-notch', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'unique', 'compelling', 'was', 'pleasure', 'learn', 'new', 'Columbo', 'movie', 'was', 'network', 'schedule', 'knew', 'two', 'hours', 'would', 'spend', 'watching', 'show', 'meant', 'great', 'way', 'spend', 'evening', 'good', 'entertainment', 'challenged', 'mind.Oh', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'really', 'regret', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'brilliant', 'complete', 'series', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'well-written', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'drama', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'own', 'collection']",N/A

1574621,A3OPWR72IQ2DN0,B008RJ6TTC,jpop,"[0, 0]","The concept behind this series works because of its main character, Lt. Columbo, supposedly an everyday guy who rambles on about his wife and what he had for breakfast while obsessing over miniscule details of the murder cases he's working on.  It's not a whodunit because we see that in the first half hour.  We also see how he did it and know why he did it.  So what is the mystery?  The mystery is in how Lt. Columbo will eventually bring down these pompous, self-important, overbearing killers and trap them in their own web of deceit.  Each story follows the same trend.  Columbo will present himself as non-threatening and unassuming and will proceed to make a pest of himself to the murderers who are almost always upper-scale, holier than thou types that we the viewer want to see knocked down a peg or two.  Columbo will badger the killer until the murderer is actually postulating theories on why he thinks the killer might have done something a certain way.  It's the same thing every week but with different characters in different situations.

Despite my opening criticisms, this is a show that one can become totally engrossed in. It keeps you engrossed from beginning to end- not with gimmicks, like action or gore, but with intrigue. Yes, I said intrigue- even though we know at the start who committed the crime; the intrigue enters when we try and fathom how Columbo will solve it! Truly a brilliant concept for a show, and so well executed in this series. In addition, there is always amusement/humor at Columbo's mannerisms; attire; car; dog, etc.But wait- there's MORE! This series is a treasure trove of past acting greats whose names most generation-Xers such as myself may have heard of, but we have never really had the chance to see perform. These were actors and actresses who took the craft seriously and had some real talent- unlike most of the ilk that inhabits Hollywood today. Sheesh! I'll give you 18 actors of today for one Jack Cassidy!(Who is in three episodes!)There's even more! Something about this show that I can't even put into words. It's the kind of show that you just want to sit and watch endlessly on a rainy night. It's pure entertainment, as it is so engrossing, and transports you to another world- as only the most well-made shows can. Not to mention the nostalgic aspect- as we get to see the cars and appliances and decor and fashion of the upper-middle-c lass-and-above world of the period (Which, in my case, brings back so many memories of how much better the world was then).I am SO thankful to be able to have the entire series to watch whenever I want and without commercials! Some of these eps I haven't seen since they first aired (Yes, I was a fan of this show even when I was 10 !!)- If you're already a fan of this show, you wouldn't be reading these reviews; if you have never seen Columbo.....you are in for a rare treat. This show is totally unique. I don't like cop shows in general- but this is no mere cop show! And it is suitable for everyone and the entire family, as there is no real violence shown, nor profanity. Even in the few scenarios where the villains are involved in affairs, you never see anything that you'd have to censor. A true class-act. This one has truly stood the test of time: I enjoyed it when I was 10- and I enjoy it even more now that I'm 50 !",5,Intriguing; Engrossing; Wonderful!,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,2522,"['O-K', 'evidence', 'would', 'NEVER', 'hold', 'up', 'real', 'court', 'real', 'cops', 'are', ""n't"", 'nice', 'intelligent', 'as', 'conscientious', 'Columbo', 'things', 'would', 'normally', 'turn', 'other', 'show', '.but', 'Columbo', 'much', 'more', 'other', 'show', 'opening', 'criticisms', 'show', 'one', 'can', 'become', 'totally', 'engrossed', 'engrossed', 'beginning', 'end-', 'not', 'gimmicks', 'action', 'gore', 'intrigue', 'Yes', 'said', 'intrigue-', 'even', 'know', 'start', 'who', 'committed', 'crime', 'intrigue', 'enters', 'when', 'try', 'fathom', 'how', 'Columbo', 'will', 'solve', 'Truly', 'brilliant', 'concept', 'show', 'so', 'well', 'executed', 'series', 'addition', 'always', 'amusement/humor', 'Columbo', 'mannerisms', 'attire', 'car', 'dog', 'etc.But', 'wait-', 'MORE', 'series', 'treasure', 'trove', 'past', 'acting', 'greats', 'names', 'most', 'generation-Xers', 'such', 'myself', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'perform', 'were', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'took', 'craft', 'seriously', 'had', 'real', 'talent-', 'most', 'ilk', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'Sheesh', ""'ll"", 'give', '18', 'actors', 'today', 'one', 'Jack', 'Cassidy', 'Who', 'three', 'episodes', 'even', 'more', 'Something', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'put', 'words', 'kind', 'show', 'just', 'want', 'sit', 'watch', 'endlessly', 'rainy', 'night', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'so', 'engrossing', 'transports', 'world-', 'only', 'most', 'well-made', 'shows', 'can', 'Not', 'mention', 'nostalgic', 'aspect-', 'get', 'see', 'cars', 'appliances', 'decor', 'fashion', 'upper-middle-c', 'lass-and-above', 'world', 'period', 'Which', 'case', 'back', 'so', 'many', 'memories', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'world', 'was', 'then', '.I', 'am', 'SO', 'thankful', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'entire', 'series', 'watch', 'whenever', 'want', 'commercials', 'eps', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'aired', 'Yes', 'was', 'fan', 'show', 'even', 'when', 'was', '10', ""'re"", 'already', 'fan', 'show', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'reading', 'reviews', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Columbo', '..you', 'are', 'rare', 'treat', 'show', 'totally', 'unique', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'cop', 'shows', 'general-', 'mere', 'cop', 'show', 'suitable', 'everyone', 'entire', 'family', 'real', 'violence', 'shown', 'profanity', 'Even', 'few', 'scenarios', 'where', 'villains', 'are', 'involved', 'affairs', 'never', 'see', 'anything', ""'d"", 'have', 'censor', 'true', 'class-act', 'one', 'truly', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'enjoyed', 'when', 'was', '10-', 'enjoy', 'even', 'more', 'now', ""'m"", '50']",N/A

Basically, I was happy to continue watching because the show is consistently good, though rarely great.Columbo is eminantly likable, but paper thin. What do we get to know about him except he likes chili, is married, has a dog, has kids (mentioned exactly once, I think) and drives a Peugeot. We never even get a first name. His taste is middle brow; I think he bowls. Why does he drive a Peogeot?  This is never answered.  Even in the elongated movies, we get nothing more about him. we know more about his wife.What is not paper thin is his relationship with the perpetrator of the crime. The best episodes involve Columbo getting into the head of the perpetrator and leading him or her into incriminating him/herself. I am thinking of Columbo convincing Robert Vaughn to incriminate himself on the cruise liner. The key to good episodes is the actor playing the perpetrator of the crime, which is pretty strange for a crime drama (though i might call it a melodrama.) There are plenty of good actors in the role of the perpetrator.The show has a distinct formula - watch the crime commited, then wonder how Columbo will solve the crime. In some formulaic shows, like House MD, deviations from the norm lead to the best drama. This is not the case with Columbo. When a psychopath kidnaps Columbo's nephew's bride, Columbo never interacts with the criminal, and the attempt at high drama fails.One of my pet peeves is the intro to the non-movie episodes which contain tidbits of the show to follow. As someoe who has watched before, I don't want to be reminded of what is to follow; I try to ignore the intro.I might have given this a 4th star but the movies are lengthened with largely with filler and have many of the weaker stories.Columbo is not riveting, but is still a staple.",3,consistently good,1366329600,"04 19, 2013",2013,1876,"['have', 'watched', 'entirety', 'Columbo', 'series', 'everything', 'included', 'complete', 'set', 'Basically', 'was', 'happy', 'continue', 'watching', 'show', 'consistently', 'good', 'rarely', 'great.Columbo', 'eminantly', 'likable', 'paper', 'thin', 'What', 'do', 'get', 'know', 'chili', 'married', 'dog', 'kids', 'mentioned', 'exactly', 'once', 'think', 'Peugeot', 'never', 'even', 'get', 'first', 'name', 'taste', 'middle', 'brow', 'think', 'Why', 'drive', 'Peogeot', 'never', 'answered', 'Even', 'elongated', 'movies', 'get', 'nothing', 'more', 'know', 'more', 'wife.What', 'not', 'paper', 'thin', 'relationship', 'perpetrator', 'crime', 'best', 'episodes', 'involve', 'Columbo', 'getting', 'head', 'perpetrator', 'leading', 'incriminating', 'am', 'thinking', 'Columbo', 'convincing', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'incriminate', 'cruise', 'liner', 'key', 'good', 'episodes', 'actor', 'playing', 'perpetrator', 'crime', 'pretty', 'strange', 'crime', 'drama', 'i', 'might', 'call', 'melodrama', 'are', 'plenty', 'good', 'actors', 'role', 'perpetrator.The', 'show', 'distinct', 'formula', 'watch', 'crime', 'commited', 'then', 'wonder', 'how', 'Columbo', 'will', 'solve', 'crime', 'formulaic', 'shows', 'House', 'MD', 'deviations', 'norm', 'lead', 'best', 'drama', 'not', 'case', 'Columbo', 'When', 'psychopath', 'Columbo', 'nephew', 'bride', 'Columbo', 'never', 'criminal', 'attempt', 'high', 'drama', 'fails.One', 'pet', 'peeves', 'intro', 'non-movie', 'episodes', 'contain', 'tidbits', 'show', 'follow', 'someoe', 'who', 'watched', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'reminded', 'what', 'follow', 'try', 'ignore', 'intro.I', 'might', 'have', 'given', '4th', 'star', 'movies', 'are', 'lengthened', 'largely', 'filler', 'have', 'many', 'weaker', 'stories.Columbo', 'not', 'riveting', 'still', 'staple']",N/A

Peter Falk is the unflappable, even-tempered detective who is invariably underestimated by murderers, as noted by the murderer in the pilot, a shrink played by Gene Barry.  I always thought of the villain as the Lawrence Harvey killer, but actually, although the killers were always cold-blooded and quick-witted, the most appearances were probably by Falk's friend, actor Patrick McGoohan, who also directed episodes and specialized in the cool, self-possessed individual whether in Secret Agent in the early 60's, or the Mel Gibson movie Braveheart in which he played the English king.
