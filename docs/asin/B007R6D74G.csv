There are many very predictable moments in plot and witty humor along the way. Again we meet the same boy from the first movie and that's what I dislike. I don't like that actor. He is obnoxious, annoying like in other movies and I also dislike his attitude and to see him fall in 'love' with a girl right from the start of the movie is very 'original'. A girl was an unnecessary character. Didn't like her, because her character reminds me of other girlish characters from other movies. I think the decoding of the message that took place in the beginning of the movie was a little too fast. Everything happens fast, even getting to the mysterious island. The special effects, creatures, plants, all look unrealistic, even bouncing off the ground that happens when the boy falls of the bird or swimming in the water (some parts). By the way how a boy that had hurt his leg so bad he couldn't walk could swim very well by using his legs? Slow-motion was used frequently. Riding the beasts is easy as anything, fear in characters even of the heights is almost absent. Characters that get separated from the group and run a long way in different directions don't have or need to search for others. They are they are in a second or few. Getting lost on an island is impossible. When they say that island goes under water after the period of time nobody mentions what happens to trees, elephants and all that. They must be able to live underwater and repopulate when the island gets dry again. Yet when the volcano's will erupt they'll show an island collapsing in many pieces. If this happens every 140 years, I wonder the island also looks intact apart from other weirdness. The explosion that happens underwater in a few meters away from the submarine does no damage to the submarine and its glass. Still it's an all right movie, was entertaining and not too bad to watch. This movie is for kids, maybe some teenagers along the way. There is just a lot I don't like in this movie. Yet I am giving it 3.5 because it's not a bad movie and maybe, just maybe I would watch it again some day.Update: Looked at 4-5 stars reviews and I realized that I was right. Many parents write that it is a family movie and their 4 or 7 year old children absolutely love it.

1536259,AXOZ5BWOEDL76,B007R6D74G,Andrew C. Miller,"[0, 0]","Journey 2: The Mysterious Island [Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray] [Region Free] [UK Release] The follow-up to the 2008 hit! The new journey begins when young adventurer Sean [Josh Hutcherson] receives a coded distress signal from a mysterious island where no island should exist... a place of strange life forms, mountains of gold, deadly volcanoes, and more than one astonishing secret. Unable to stop him from going, Sean's new stepfather [Dwayne Johnson] joins the quest. Together with a helicopter pilot [Luis Guzman] and his beautiful, strong-willed daughter [Vanessa Hudgens], they set out to find the island, rescue its lone inhabitant and escape before seismic shockwaves force the island under the sea and bury its treasures forever.Cast: Dwayne Johnson, Josh Hutcherson, Branscombe Richmond, Vanessa Hudgens, Kristin Davis, Luis Guzm&aacute;n and Michael CaineDirector: Brad PeytonProducers: Beau Flynn, Charlotte Huggins and Tripp VinsonComposer: Andrew LockingtonResolution: 1080pAspect Ratio: 1.78:1Audio: English: 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French: Dolby Digital 5.1, Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1 and Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1Subtitles: Finnish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Spanish, Swedish, Portuguese, Dutch, Danish, English, Greek, Russian, Polish, Arabic and CzechDubbed: Czech, Cantonese Chinese, Spanish, Italian, German, French, Polish and RussianSubtitles For The Hearing Impaired: English, Italian and GermanRegion: All RegionsRunning Time: 94 minutesNumber of discs: 2Studio: Warner Home VideoAndrew&#8217;s Blu-ray Review &#8211; Journey 2: The Mysterious Island is a sequel to the 2008&#8217;s family oriented action and effects extravaganza Journey to the Center of the Earth.  As with its predecessor, it does not adapt the Jules Verne novel of the same name, but instead tells a new story set in modern times based around the premise that Verne&#8217;s fiction was based on fact, and modern day &#8220;Vernians&#8221; are actively working to crack codes hidden in his and other contemporaneous works that will unlock the secrets to visiting fantastic locales. This sequel begins with Sean Anderson [Josh Hutcherson - the sole cast carryover from the first film], receiving a coded transmission that he is convinced is coming from his Grandfather Alexander [Michael Caine] stranded on Verne&#8217;s &#8220;Mysterious Island&#8221;.  With the help of his stepfather, Hank [Dwayne Johnson], he makes the connection that Verne&#8217;s Island is actually the same island referenced by Robert Louis Stevenson in &#8220;Treasure Island&#8221; and by Jonathan Swift in &#8220;Gulliver&#8217;s Travels&#8221;. By combining maps from all three books (don&#8217;t ask what editions, just roll with it!), they are able to pinpoint the location in the Pacific where the island must be.  With the help of helicopter tour guide Gabato [Luis Guzm&aacute;n] and his daughter Kailani [Vanessa Hudgens] they locate the island, but find themselves stranded, a situation the becomes more critical when they discover that the island is not so slowly sinking into the sea.As a rule, I take offense at sequels that either barely connect the dots to their predecessor or completely re-hash their predecessor (I&#8217;m looking at you, Hangover 2). Journey 2: The Mysterious Island somehow manages to do both, and yet I found it to be overall a more enjoyable experience than Journey to the Center of the Earth. While in the first film, Hutcherson was the tagalong nephew attaching himself to his Uncle&#8217;s quest to track down their missing father/brother. This film simply flips the roles with Hutcherson now a dedicated &#8220;Vernian&#8221; dragging his skeptical stepfather along on the journey. They even shamelessly repeat the device of stranding them with a tour guide and daughter conveniently age appropriate to be a chastely romantic interest for Hutcherson.Michael Caine is in full-on hammy scenery chewing mode, and while excerpts from this film will never show up on his career highlight reels, his performance is exactly what the movie calls for.  His constant barbs thrown in the direction of Dwayne Johnson&#8217;s Hank character are not particularly witty or even dramatically earned in the context of the story, but they are delivered with a great deal of relish by Caine.  It does not hurt that Johnson is such a good sport and not afraid to look ridiculous either, but that was also the case with Brendan Fraser in the first film.  For whatever reason, there is simply a better comic chemistry between Caine and Johnson that there was between Fraser and some of his nondescript co-stars.  Luis Guzman&#8217;s mix of comic buffoonery and sentimentality as the tour guide is also more in keeping with the fun and forgettable tone of the film than the more competent tour guide from the first film.In summary, the film presents a modestly fun, mostly preposterous and ultimately forgettable action and effects romp that will likely please its target audience of ten year olds. Who knows? It might even trick them into reading a Jules Verne book.Blu-ray Video Quality &#8211; Journey 2 gets a shiny 1.85:1 1080p presentation, and it looks excellent. Colours leap off the screen, fine detail is through the roof, and contrast is rock-solid. The only downside to such a vibrant, squeaky-clean picture is that it kind of betrays the film's reduced budget: it sort of looks and feels like a television show, highlighting the line between a set and a digital backdrop. Of course, even that's sort of reflective of the image's quality: it's showing you a level of detail the filmmakers might not want the viewer to notice. Warner offers up a transfer whose bright colours pop off the screen. There is a lot of eye candy to be absorbed; lush green jungles, deep blue oceans, and scaly drooling monstrosities. The picture has a deep clarity that makes everything look crystal clear.Blu-ray Audio Quality &#8211; The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is fitting of a big adventure picture. Rumbling hurricanes, tumbling rocks, buzzing bees, screeching birds, an underwater electric eel, and Dwayne Johnson's singing voice are all replicated with crystal clarity and nice directionality. It's been awhile since I really felt like I was getting the theatre experience watching a movie at home (to be fair, probably more indicative of my film selection than any audio deficiencies), but this really felt like a blockbuster, with great immersive, weighty mixing. I even liked Andrew Lockington's score, which is understated, but pleasingly so. This is the kind of movie that features all kinds of rollicking surround sounds. The front, rear, and side speakers are all engaged without any obvious defects.Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:All the following extras are presented in 1080p video with Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo audio via the DVD only.Are You Strong Enough to Survive Mysterious Island? [21:07] is a series of featurettes that are viewable in either of two selectable modes called &#8220;Interactive&#8221; and &#8220;Junior Explorer&#8221;. The &#8220;Interactive&#8221; mode asks the user to make a selection after each featurette that guides them towards another section of an interactive map that corresponds to another featurette. The &#8220;Junior Explorer&#8221; mode simply plays all ten featurettes straight through in a predetermined order.  Both modes are preceded by a 24 second introduction from Josh Hutcherson (&#8220;Sean&#8221;).  Once all ten featurettes are viewed in either mode, the viewer is treated to a congratulatory message from Hutcherson and a minute and a half of outtakes from the film. The featurettes themselves mix behind the scenes information about various sequences and design elements of the film with related &#8220;real life facts&#8221; from experts in biology, geology, scuba diving, and Jules Verne. The featurette topics and durations are as follows:Giant Lizard (1:56) / Atlantis (1:51) / Tree House Set (1:45) / Giant Flowers (1:50) / Volcanic Mountain of Gold (1:36) / Giant Bees (2:15) / Glowing Mushrooms (1:23) / Captain Nemo&#8217;s Tomb (2:10) / The Ocean (Water Tank) (2:04) / The Nautilus Submarine (2:12)Deleted Scenes [5:54] is a collection of five scenes that did not make the final cut of the movie. A number of them feature unfinished effects which appear as crude animatronics and/or blue screen backgrounds mixed in with the live actors. The individual scenes are not selectable from the disc menu, but they are encoded with chapter stops between them. Scene descriptions follow:1. Discussion by the group of five island adventurers about how animals can survive an unusual recurring event that happens to the island.2. Some extra arguing between Sean, his mother, and Hank after Sean&#8217;s arrest at the beginning of the film. This scene directly references the events of the previous film.3. Alexander, Kailani, and Gabato face some additional jeopardy from falling pillars.4. A fairly long scene from early in the film where Hank seeks parenting tips from one of his employees on a construction site.5. Some additional congratulations, teasing, and sentimentality near the end of the film aboard a submarine.Gag Reel [1:15] is a mercifully brief assemblage of on-set flubs, falls, and goofing around set to fast paced music.Finally, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island is full of adventure and excitement that should be fun for the entire family. And while this isn't a direct telling of Verne&#8217;s story, I think this is a great way to introduce your children to a variety of classic literature, as this movie pulls a little from a variety of some of the best-known authors. Furthermore, with such a great presentation, this Blu-ray will definitely become a family favourite. I would definitely recommend going 3D on this movie. Either way Journey 2 is very enjoyable but the 3D truly completes the experience. Like the previous Journey Blu-ray release, I was worried this film would be a total dud, as Dwayne Johnson is a wrestler and not a trained actor, but I was pleasantly surprised how good he was in this film and it is a brilliant follow up 3D Blu-ray and a great Double Feature and is also a stunning brilliant 3D presentation that will have your guest have a great jaw dropping entertainment and again I am so proud to add this to my ever increasing 3D Blu-ray Collection.

1536306,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B007R6D74G,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","JOURNEY 2: THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND (Dir. Brad Peyton, 2012, 94 minutes) is a sort of mish-mash combination of a little Jules Verne, maybe a little more Jules Verne, the worst of Disney live action, and some very nonhumorous attempts at humor by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson - who has potential but never seems to get anywhere near it. Only his good looks and his President Obama-like voice can save him.Here, Dwayne plays Hank, stepfather to the rambunctious and bizarrely underachieving genius, Sean (the gorgeous Josh Hutcherson, who in real life likes to wear t-shirts that say ""Straight but not narrow"", a BIG lavender flag). Hutcherson returns fromJourney to the Center of the Earth, which was so bad I felt deeply sorry for him. Having originally seen him in Robin Williams' attempted comeback inRV, then having enjoyed him immensely inBridge To Terabithia, I couldn't believe my eyes seeing Josh so beautifully grown.This is one of those young guys who actually makes my insides hurt. He is that lovely - and he has always made my ""gaydar"" leap like a volcano of gold.Apparently working very hard to avoid any logical script here, Sean gets a mysterious ham radio coded message - from his grandfather (Sir Michael Caine, how the heck did HE get stuck in this??). It works out to reveal the grandfather has found the mysterious island Verne wrote about, and the film has an interesting little turn in which three separate books, includingTreasure Island, combine map illustrations to show the location of the island. It also handily gives the coordinates.Since this is a rush-like-hell-to-go-nowhere film, I was hardly surprised when stepdad buys spoiled little Sean tickets to Palau. That's right - all the way to Palau, because the island is someplace off the coast of Palau. Here then appears one of my favorite comic actors, Luis Guzman as a Palauan tour guide. And yes, he has a cute sex kitten daughter (the very sweet and beautiful Vanessa Hudgens) because, well, we can't have even the remotest hint that Sean might be a little gay boy. Enter the grotesque and endless ogling/panting courtesy of Sean and directed at her.Aside from all the insults to one's intelligence, hey, it was a fun kid's film (aside from what I can only assume was an accidental shot of Hudgens' entire hindquarters in scanty shorts). With films like these, as dunderheaded as they make them but at least not malicious, I have to wonder if scenes like the incredible butt of Vanessa Hudgens filling the entire screen are ""accidental"" or what.To my deep disappointment, I saw no such marvelously revealing scenes with Josh, Dwayne or for that matter, Luis Guzman! Surprise, surprise. Michael Caine delivers a spirited, fun performance here because I don't think he could act poorly if he tried. Pity then that his character is so underused. Kid's stuff all the way, except for the hilarious insults Dwayne hurls at Michael Caine. Example, Dwayne says to Josh, ""You were looking for your grandmother, well, there she is.""Later, Sir Michael asks Dwayne, ""how do like grandma NOW?!"" Also I have to give major props for the seamless special effects, which at least made the film bearable, as well as believable for a bit more than five minutes.Aww, they just don't really make them like this anymore. Verne was my father's favorite author, I love and respect Verne, I like to think my dad and I were ""Vernians"" - so I can't decide whether to take this film as an insult or an incentive to young audiences.They don't make them like this ... am I glad or what, I actually have no idea. However, I rated this 3 stars for not knowing how to handle Vanessa's butt. Or Josh's inherent, inescapable gayness. Actually, in what I can only deduce is a race to conquer the widest audience, they did actually handle Josh's butt very well as they did with The Rock. They didn't show them AT ALL. After the revealing, embarrassing 'Vanessa shot', I was impressed - and angered - that they avoided at all costs shooting similar scenes of Dwayne's and Josh's assets.Hey! WE'RE watching these movies too! Don't we get a tiny little payoff now and then?! And don't even talk to me about The Rock's dancing pecs, though they served a hilarious comic relief here. Some courage and a little reality from Follywood production companies like this are way overdue for me to be quiet about it any longer.",3,"""How do you like grandma NOW?!""",1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,4357,"['JOURNEY', '2', 'MYSTERIOUS', 'ISLAND', 'Dir', 'Brad', 'Peyton', '2012', '94', 'minutes', 'sort', 'mish-mash', 'combination', 'little', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'maybe', 'little', 'more', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'worst', 'Disney', 'live', 'action', 'very', 'nonhumorous', 'attempts', 'humor', 'Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'who', 'potential', 'never', 'get', 'anywhere', 'Only', 'good', 'looks', 'President', 'Obama-like', 'voice', 'can', 'save', 'him.Here', 'Dwayne', 'Hank', 'stepfather', 'rambunctious', 'bizarrely', 'underachieving', 'genius', 'Sean', 'gorgeous', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'likes', 'wear', 't-shirts', 'say', 'Straight', 'not', 'narrow', 'BIG', 'lavender', 'flag', 'Hutcherson', 'fromJourney', 'Center', 'Earth', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'felt', 'deeply', 'sorry', 'Having', 'originally', 'seen', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'attempted', 'comeback', 'inRV', 'then', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'inBridge', 'Terabithia', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'eyes', 'seeing', 'Josh', 'so', 'beautifully', 'grown.This', 'one', 'young', 'guys', 'who', 'actually', 'insides', 'hurt', 'lovely', 'always', 'made', 'gaydar', 'volcano', 'gold.Apparently', 'working', 'very', 'hard', 'avoid', 'logical', 'script', 'here', 'Sean', 'mysterious', 'ham', 'radio', 'coded', 'message', 'grandfather', 'Sir', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'how', 'heck', 'did', 'HE', 'get', 'stuck', 'out', 'reveal', 'grandfather', 'found', 'mysterious', 'island', 'Verne', 'wrote', 'film', 'interesting', 'little', 'turn', 'three', 'separate', 'books', 'includingTreasure', 'Island', 'combine', 'map', 'illustrations', 'show', 'location', 'island', 'also', 'handily', 'coordinates.Since', 'rush-like-hell-to-go-nowhere', 'film', 'was', 'hardly', 'surprised', 'when', 'stepdad', 'spoiled', 'little', 'Sean', 'tickets', 'Palau', 'right', 'way', 'Palau', 'island', 'someplace', 'coast', 'Palau', 'Here', 'then', 'one', 'favorite', 'comic', 'actors', 'Luis', 'Guzman', 'Palauan', 'tour', 'guide', 'yes', 'cute', 'sex', 'kitten', 'daughter', 'very', 'sweet', 'beautiful', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'remotest', 'hint', 'Sean', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'gay', 'boy', 'Enter', 'grotesque', 'endless', 'ogling/panting', 'courtesy', 'Sean', 'directed', 'her.Aside', 'insults', 'one', 'intelligence', 'hey', 'was', 'fun', 'kid', 'film', 'aside', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'was', 'accidental', 'shot', 'Hudgens', 'entire', 'hindquarters', 'scanty', 'shorts', 'films', 'as', 'dunderheaded', 'make', 'least', 'not', 'malicious', 'have', 'wonder', 'scenes', 'incredible', 'butt', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'filling', 'entire', 'screen', 'are', 'accidental', 'what.To', 'deep', 'disappointment', 'saw', 'such', 'marvelously', 'revealing', 'scenes', 'Josh', 'Dwayne', 'matter', 'Luis', 'Guzman', 'Surprise', 'surprise', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'spirited', 'fun', 'performance', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'act', 'poorly', 'tried', 'Pity', 'then', 'character', 'so', 'underused', 'Kid', 'stuff', 'way', 'hilarious', 'insults', 'Dwayne', 'hurls', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Example', 'Dwayne', 'Josh', 'were', 'looking', 'grandmother', 'well', 'Later', 'Sir', 'Michael', 'Dwayne', 'how', 'do', 'grandma', 'NOW', 'Also', 'have', 'give', 'major', 'props', 'seamless', 'special', 'effects', 'least', 'made', 'film', 'bearable', 'as', 'well', 'believable', 'bit', 'more', 'five', 'minutes.Aww', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'anymore', 'Verne', 'was', 'father', 'favorite', 'author', 'love', 'respect', 'Verne', 'like', 'think', 'dad', 'were', 'Vernians', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'take', 'film', 'insult', 'incentive', 'young', 'audiences.They', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'am', 'glad', 'what', 'actually', 'have', 'idea', 'However', 'rated', '3', 'stars', 'not', 'knowing', 'how', 'handle', 'Vanessa', 'butt', 'Josh', 'inherent', 'inescapable', 'gayness', 'Actually', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'deduce', 'race', 'conquer', 'widest', 'audience', 'did', 'actually', 'handle', 'Josh', 'butt', 'very', 'well', 'did', 'Rock', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'AT', 'ALL', 'revealing', 'embarrassing', ""'Vanessa"", 'shot', 'was', 'impressed', 'angered', 'avoided', 'costs', 'shooting', 'similar', 'scenes', 'Dwayne', 'Josh', 'assets.Hey', 'WE', ""'RE"", 'watching', 'movies', 'too', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'tiny', 'little', 'payoff', 'now', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'talk', 'Rock', 'dancing', 'pecs', 'served', 'hilarious', 'comic', 'relief', 'here', 'courage', 'little', 'reality', 'Follywood', 'production', 'companies', 'are', 'way', 'overdue', 'be', 'quiet', 'longer']",N/A

I assumed it was a no-brainer, who could ruin a readymade concept like this?They lost my interest during the first few minutes and nothing they could slam at the screen after that could coax me into liking this movie (not even the wildly amusing performance by Luis Guzman).It's obvious that they spent a fortune on the effects then forgot to waste a dime on the script.  To suggest the story was ""dumbed-down"" for the benefit of children is to do the writers a disservice; they took all of five minutes to slap their story together, ripped it right out of the official playbook of stupidity.  This was Jules Verne for Dummies.  This is what you get when people who lack originality have to muck about with someone else's work.  Worse.  They thought no one would notice the lacking in their script if they ran everything at a breakneck speed.  They had everything working like clockwork, starting with the clich&eacute; of the angst-riddled brat oozing with attitude (Josh Hutcherson), to the nitwit grandfather (Michael Caine), the comic sidekick (Luis Guzman) and the obligatory babe in training (Vanessa Hudgens), with poor Dwayne Johnson doing double time trying to act out the part of the put upon stepfather.  Every aspect of this movie was a contrivance, there only for the convenience of an inadequately thought out story that was little more than a series of sight gags cobbled together.  What was this, a commercial for the merits of 3D?  (If you didn't get the point straight off, they happily repeated things in slow motion!)Just once I'd like to see a film without a snotty teen in the starring role.  Not only is it an aching clich&eacute;, it's also not that entertaining to watch.  Kids like that you ground, you don't take them on vacation and hope they'll snap out of it.

The only thing worse than a bad movie nightis a bad movie night that ultimately becomes a double bill. I made the mistake of blind buying a South Koreanfilm that I watched the same evening that was also unbearable called ""Quick"" that I reviewed under it's propertitle.Good news first: It's a short movie thankfully! Michael Caine was enjoyable as always in this kind of role.The film was at least shot in native 3D unlike most 3D films being released right now that are conversions.This is a decent family film with no significant objectionable content that prevents many films from beingfamily friendly. The 3D is very good in several scenes with some nice pop outs and depth is consistent. TheAQ is great! The 3D PQ was good overall, but does have some detractors that I will mention below.Bad news: The writing and acting are unbearable excluding Michael Caine. I'm surprised this movie has a 4 star rating on Amazon.  I figured it would at least be split with 2 stars, but I guess the 4 star rating indicates that more films like this will continue to be made.  I did make it through the wholemovie which I cannot say for the awful South Korean film ""Quick"" that I fast forwarded through the 2nd half ofon the same night. While I expected the cheese factor to be high; I was also expecting it to come with somebeef. I'm making myself hungry as I write this, but I digress. The first movie is significantly better than thesequel which isn't much of a surprise, given most sequels aren't as good as their predecessor. This moviemade me start to wish for Uwe Boll since his movies are often so bad they are funny. The 3D had someghosting issues that were bothersome, especially when the far off shots that should have had a lot of depthinstead had a rather blurry look to them which was disappointing. This movie jumped the proverbial shark forme when Luis Guzman's character started throwing cherries at The Rock's pecks as he moved them aroundsending the cherries flying back towards the screen creating a nice 3D effect. I really enjoy 3D technology,but the stupid factor hit a 10 at that point. It was funny, but in a (Wow this movie is bad) sort of way! LOL!Final thoughts: If you are looking for family friendly material in jaw dropping 3D; there are many other titlesworth your hard earned dollars. 3D BD's are expensive! Just to name a few briefly you could pick; TheAdventures of Tin Tin, Journey to the Center of the Earth part 1, and Under the Sea to name just a few. Imax3D films are all very family friendly and offer jaw dropping 3D for the most part. If you must own this in 3Dand can't rent it in 3D first; rent the 2D version and see if you can handle it.

Then the cops let him off because his stepdad is a card playing buddy to the cops. Well, that sends a good message.

And Amazon.com has family fare!To make an island this mysterious, Director Brad Peyton (""Cats and Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore"") is once again using a LOT of Computer Generated Imaging. How else can we have puppy-sized elephants and honeybees big enough to ride?We see:* Josh Hutcherson (""The Kids are All Right"") as our hero, off in quest of an island that seems to exist only in books: Jules Verne's Mysterious Island and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, and Robert Lewis Stevenson's Treasure Island. He decodes a message from his long-missing grandfather and thinks he might be stranded on an island doomed to soon disappear.* Dwayne Johnson (""Fast Five"") is our young hero's stepfather but his awkward attempt at a father-son talk is pretty pathetic. He agrees to take the boy on a trip to the South Pacific, but has no idea what the kid really has in mind.* Luis Guzm&aacute;n (""The Caller"") owns a rickety old helicopter which they hire (chickens roosting in it are his ""security system""). He knows the danger, but really needs the money to send his daughter to college.* Michael Caine (""The Dark Knight"") is our hero's grandfather, isolated on that mysterious island for many years and more than a bit daft.* Vanessa Hudgens (""Beastly"") is here for set decoration and to provide a flimsy love interest for our hero.Lame dialogue like ""Who's up for adventure?"" and calling three guys ""ladies"" is offered, along with 3-D images of centipedes skittering off rocks into our laps, cherries ricocheting off the pecs of Rock into our midst, and pieces of that helicopter as it disintegrates in a hurricane. The children in the audience weren't bored and I am, once again, impressed by Dwayne Johnson's career path. He is the most unlikely of PG-rated actors, yet he consistently entertains in these goofy things.

He's simple and acting as himself - no big surprise here. What surprised me was the fresh take on the script written by brothers Brian and Mark Gunn from a story by Richard Outten. They took Jules Vernes original story and mixed with a few others to create was is basically a sequel to Journey to the Center of the Earth with Brandon Frasier. However Brandon is not back for this one, his son played by Josh Hutchison (Hunger Games, Red Dawn) is.The story is an adventure that Josh's character wants to partake and his step-dad (Dwyane) wants to take with him. Of course, they are reluctant at first, but later realize that two lessons can be learned. (Basically each trying to prove the other wrong!) I like the humor and fun of the adventure in the film. It's no Indiana Jones, but definitely a fun film.Of course, it's an exotic, unapproachable island where Josh's grandfather, amazing played by Michael Caine (Batman Begins, Prestige, The Cider House Rules) is suspected to be looking for the actual Jules Verne `Mysterious Island' - complete with the Nautilus and Captain Nemo himself!In order to get there we meet a ragged helicopter pilot played by Luis Guzman (Boogie Man, Arthur) and his daughter, the love interest, played by Vanessa Hudgens (High School Musical, Sucker Punch). Well of course the father gets them stranded and Vanessa has caught Josh's eye.The movie spends most of its time trying to get these five people of the island because it is sinking, however the effects are pretty sharp and the humor is witty. The ending is suspenseful and even had all the kids in the audience applauding at the results of the families working together. Quite cute.  This is a fun family film with giant bees, spider and miniature elephants too! Great fun for the family. Not high concept, not boldly broad in theme - just plain family fun!

1536376,A2BFASQFTVJHPM,B007R6D74G,L.R. Ring,"[1, 1]","I'll come right out and say it: I'm not really a fan of this film.  I like the first one, with Brendan Fraser -- it has plenty of action, gets you emotionally involved with the characters, handled the inevitable romance in a way that didn't make me want to barf, is just cheesy enough to be fun without being too stupid, and the 3D effects make it worth seeing.  All in all a good film for days when I want to switch off my brain for 90 minutes and enjoy some mindless escapism.This sequel meanwhile is so dull.  It's not well-paced, and any onscreen tension quickly vanishes before it has a chance to produce thrills.  Because we couldn't have that.  The very idea!  It's almost as if the director was going out of his way to make this boring instead of an action-packed adventure film.  The few chase scenes and stuff that we do get rely so heavily on Matrix-like slow motion shots that it starts to get tedious.  They also manage to make me feel more sympathy for the animal &#34;monsters&#34; involved than the actual human protagonists.  Speaking of the humans, the characters are bland paper cutouts who can be reduced purely to their function within the story: the hero.  The hero's future girlfriend.  The comic relief.  The step-dad.  The crazy grandfather.  And so on.  The romance feels forced and and cliche and treats the girl pretty much just as an object for the hero to pursue and win in the end.  Because that's why we girls exist: so guys can date us.  Anything else is crazy talk.  (Rolls eyes in disgust.)  The dialogue meanwhile is ridiculous.  Some of the interchanges make me laugh, and not for the right reasons.  The one decent thing about this movie is the Rock -- and sadly he can't save it for me.  I honestly get more enjoyment making fun of this film than actually watching it.  It also doesn't help that unlike the first Journey film, the DVD release just has the 2D version; I think 3D might make it a little more palatable.  But I'm not gonna buy a BluRay player just so I can see one film in 3D that I don't really like anyway.Bottom line: Kids will probably enjoy it I guess.

No fast forwarding.Definitely a movie kids & families would enjoy and one I would heartily recommend for that market.The highlight for me was: ""Wow, The Rock can really sing!""Minor complaints:- Josh Hutcherson is one of those former child actors who is clearly, if he has any smarts, headed toward character actor territory. A career arc, if he plays his cards right, that will allow a transition from pretentious kid into good paying jobs as crispy weed dealer and/or snarky sidekick. Otherwise, I just can't see it.- The obvious and strained effort to squeeze 3-D elements into the picture. Director Brad Peyton just tried too hard.

An exciting story and awesome 3D that insures a fun time for adults as well as kids. So I had high hopes for its sequel, ""Journey 2: Mysterious Island"". I was disappointed. Whereas ""Journey 1"" was entertaining for all ages, ""Journey 2"" is aimed specifically for children. Since I'm not a child, my criticism is from an adult's view. First, some of the acting was way overboard. Of course, the sappy dialogue doesn't help matters. In the sequel, the boy Sean (Josh Hutcherson) comes off as so smart-alecky, disrespectful and brooding, he should be in juvenile detention. Until he meets up with his 'know-it-all' grandfather (Micael Caine), who is always laughing at others' misfortunes and mistakes. And the two of them seem to relish every opportunity to make Sean's stepdad (Dwayne Johnson) look like a stupid fool. Supposedly done for laughs, but for a film meant for kids, this sends the wrong message. Then there's the pilot (Luis Guzman) who is a total baffoon. Children might find him funny, he just made me cringe. And the scene with Dwayne Johnson's ""pec-bouncing"", while maybe amusing to children, made me want to hide my face from imbarrassment.

Now he's a brooding teenager focused on finding his grandfather (Michael Caine) who has been sending him coded messages from some unknown island, not found on any map.  With the help of his very tolerant step-father (Dwayne Johnson), a former Navy sailor, he discovers the location of the island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.Being a good guy, Hank (Johnson) agrees to finance a trip and accompany Sean to find the island and the grandfather.  Sean's mom (Kristin Davis) pretty much just nods in agreement in the few scenes she's in.  Departing from some fictitious Polynesian island, the two hook-up with a helicopter pilot (Luis Guzman) and his cute daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens).  They then fly this rickety old `copter into an approaching hurricane.  I guess they didn't get the warning??  The next thing you know, they're on the beach of a beautiful mysterious island.After Sean flirts with Kailani and Gabato (Guzman) does his I'm-so-dumb comedy bit, they find grandpa' Alexander.  Then he and Hank go at each other playfully.  Would you believe that Alexander has found the lost city of Atlantis too?  Most mythology has Atlantis in the Atlantic Ocean.  Couldn't they at least call it Pacificas?I haven't read Jules Verne's novel but I doubt much of the silliness in this film can be found in the book.  For example.  Instead of walking around a large nest of eggs, the adventurers walk on top of them, even after one cracks.  This allows Guzman to fall into the embryonic fluid.  Ewww!  The eggs themselves are about 3 times as large as they should be based on momma lizard's size as she comes running.  I'm not sure how many eggs a lizard normally lays but there are dozens at this location.I didn't see this in 3-D but I suspect that would have added some fun to the film.  In 2-D, the scenery and animals look very fake to my eye.  This film with a PG rating is aiming at a younger audience and I'm sure many will like the adventure.  For those of us over 13 or so, I'd say find something else.There's nothing wrong with the Blu ray transfer.  Shot with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio it looks very good.  Maybe too good given the obvious green screen shots and animated backdrops.

Some things parallel these classic tales, but its definitely not a tired imitation. Still, if you're looking for a movie with surprising twists and turns, this might not be the choice for you.

While I wouldn't exactly say this is my cup of tea, I do like adventure cheese likeAt the Earth's Coreso I was hoping I'd at least be in for a fun B-movie experience, though I was honestly fully expecting to not like it at all.The story starts with a very Irish kid racing home away from the cops.  He apparently broke in somewhere to steal some kind of distress code based on the writings of Jules Verne he was trying to interpret.  We then learn that Conan O'Brien Jr's step dad is The Rock and some typical step-family friction ensues.  The Rock decides to connect with Lucky Charms by helping him figure out his code in a scene that literally is over in three minutes.  Code broken, they discover its coming from Guiness McJameson's grandpa who's one some mysterious island that some 19th century authors all reference in their fiction, blah blah blah off they go to find it.Who will take them to the island?  Why its helicopter pilot andGreendalealumni Luis Guzman and his daughter, whom Potatoes O'Toole immediate falls in love with thanks to a leering cheesecake shot thatMichael Baywould be proud of (frankly, its more than a little pervy how much they sexualize the daughter character given that both the young lead characters are apparently in high school).Now that everyone's in Guzman's helicopter, of course they crash and of course the island is big and colorful and full of CGI creatures.  In this case its large creatures are small and small creatures are large, although what constitutes a ""large"" or ""small"" creature is very very arbitrary and not particularily consistant.  The gang gets chased by a big lizard, find Dropkick Murphy's grandpa (played by Michael Cane, now with more free time than ever since Batman retired with Catwoman), discover the island is sinking/blowing apart because of a golden volcano (don't ask), ride bumble bees, and do plenty of other light adventure fare.Its all pretty ridiculous, but these movies usually are, so no complaints here.  What I did appreciate was that this movie kept a fast pace, didn't overstay its welcome, and never pretended to be anything it wasn't.  The characters don't bicker or scream a lot, there's no heavy-handed emotional parts and the actors all do okay with what is a *very* weak script, but its all in good fun and seeing Guzman work hard to sell very corny jokes is pretty amusing in itself.So in the end, its an okay movie.

Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) has a new man in his life, his stepfather Hank (Dwayne Johnson). This movie is more about the relationship between Sean and Hank than a mindless clich&eacute; adventure movie. Sean grew up with a lot of loss of loved ones and people coming in and out of his life. Sean has trust issues with his new stepdad and doesn't want to get too close to him, for he's afraid that he'll leave him due to his unfortunate past. Hank wants to play a bigger role in Sean's life and hopes to finally make a bond between them. Then they uncover the mystery of the Mysterious Island and go on an adventure to find Sean's long lost grandfather (Michael Caine). The only way to get to the island is by flying by helicopter.The quirky and fun tour guide (Luis Guzman) is the comic relief in this huge journey. His daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens) is Sean's love interest in the movie. The plot itself is easy to understand for younger audiences and is fun to see how it plays out in the end. The movie is chock-full of massive set pieces which all are creatively brought to life by cinematography and editing.Vanessa Hudgens doesn't deliver the most believable performance of her career because of the fact that she acts more like a big-city girl then a hardened islander of their destination. All in all she has great chemistry between Josh Hutcherson in the movie, and should be amended for it. Luis Guzman however, delivered some tongue-in-cheek jokes throughout the film. He'll offer a couple of chuckles throughout the movie for older viewers, but most of his jokes will appeal to the younger audience.I like this movie because of its frantic action sequences and surprising suiting soundtrack. This movie may be scary for younger viewers at points such as the lizard chase sequences. The intensity and the importance of the given situation during the final act of the movie gives the audience a very good reason to sit on the edge of their seat. Overall, I think the movie was very entertaining and had many great moments. I give this movie 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for kids ages 10-15.Reviewed by Blake H, KIDS FIRST!

The special effects are sometimes cheesy, but only by recent standards set by Avatar, John Carter and others. There is no real need for the expensive effects as Dwane Johnson and Michael Caine are a delight to watch!The story is what one would anticipate, a Jules Vernes format tale on a island full of surprises and adventure. Some of the dialogue is outright corny, ""Let's have and adventure!"" but who really cares?You'll see actors doing the usual blue screen flying around on giant bees, pretty much like the special effects tour at Disneyland. It doesn't matter as this isn't meant to be taken seriously anyway.Now, I love any scene that has lots of panoramic scenery and dense tropical foliage in 3D and I must give it four stars in that department. The artists who designed the sets did a marvelous job here, sometimes coming close to the settings in Tim Burton's Alice and Wonderland. This is comparable to the recent Gulliver's Travels in story and production value with less humor.If a clever plot is important to you, you can bypass this one, however this is enjoyable fare for the whole family and I think an enjoyable 3 STARS is in order here.Kids will watch this over and over, guarenteed, and I'm just a big kid fooling around during my retirement years, so guess what?

Sean's mother allows him to go - on the condition that his new step father (Dwayne Johnson) accompanies him. But on the way to this island that shouldn't exist, their helicopter hits a storm and crashes. Now Sean, his step father, the helicopter pilot (Luis Guzman), and the pilot's daughter (Vanessa Hudgens) need to find a way off the island. Though it's full of unexplored wonders, they're in a race against time to find a way off before the whole island sinks to the ocean floor.While this is a sequel to Journey to the Center of the Earth, it's not necessary to have seen the first installment. Journey 2 is a standalone story, with Sean going on an entirely separate adventure.  As before, this adventure is immersed in classic science fiction. Fans of classic scifi, young and old, will enjoy the numerous references and Jules Verne's Mysterious Island brought to new heights. With creatures of humorous sizes, a volcano full of gold, and other bizarre secrets - this island unfortunately can't be fully explored because of an unfortunate timetable. Of course, suspension of belief must be held for most science fiction movies (especially geared towards children), but the sinking of the island really pushes it.But for the most part, this was a surprisingly enjoyable, if mostly corny and predictable, movie for young families. While a fast-paced adventure, there is no violence or profanity, so even very young children can enjoy (as long as they don't mind the occasional giant bug).  The acting is good for a heart-warming family film. Hutcherson (""Hunger Games"") and Dwane ""The Rock"" Johnson of course steer the story. And the supporting cast provides comedy relief and a cute romantic interest for Sean. Johnson has been doing a lot of family movies lately, and this may be one of his more watchable ones. I love that he can laugh at himself and still be a strong character.  All-in-all Journey 2 is a cute, family film that won't make you think too much and will entertain the kids.",3,"Cute, Family Film",1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,2154,"['When', 'Sean', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'coded', 'message', 'grandfather', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'leave', 'immediately', 'fabled', 'Mysterious', 'Island', 'Sean', 'mother', 'go', 'condition', 'new', 'step', 'father', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'way', 'island', 'should', ""n't"", 'exist', 'helicopter', 'storm', 'crashes', 'Now', 'Sean', 'step', 'father', 'helicopter', 'pilot', 'Luis', 'Guzman', 'pilot', 'daughter', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'need', 'find', 'way', 'island', 'full', 'unexplored', 'wonders', ""'re"", 'race', 'time', 'find', 'way', 'whole', 'island', 'sinks', 'ocean', 'floor.While', 'sequel', 'Journey', 'Center', 'Earth', 'not', 'necessary', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'installment', 'Journey', '2', 'standalone', 'story', 'Sean', 'going', 'entirely', 'separate', 'adventure', 'before', 'adventure', 'immersed', 'classic', 'science', 'fiction', 'Fans', 'classic', 'scifi', 'young', 'old', 'will', 'enjoy', 'numerous', 'references', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'Mysterious', 'Island', 'brought', 'new', 'heights', 'creatures', 'humorous', 'sizes', 'volcano', 'full', 'gold', 'other', 'bizarre', 'secrets', 'island', 'unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'fully', 'explored', 'unfortunate', 'timetable', 'course', 'suspension', 'belief', 'must', 'be', 'held', 'most', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'especially', 'geared', 'towards', 'children', 'sinking', 'island', 'really', 'it.But', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'enjoyable', 'mostly', 'corny', 'predictable', 'movie', 'young', 'families', 'fast-paced', 'adventure', 'violence', 'profanity', 'so', 'even', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'can', 'enjoy', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'occasional', 'giant', 'bug', 'acting', 'good', 'heart-warming', 'family', 'film', 'Hutcherson', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'Dwane', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'course', 'steer', 'story', 'supporting', 'cast', 'comedy', 'relief', 'cute', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Sean', 'Johnson', 'been', 'doing', 'lot', 'family', 'movies', 'lately', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'watchable', 'ones', 'love', 'can', 'laugh', 'still', 'be', 'strong', 'character', 'All-in-all', 'Journey', '2', 'cute', 'family', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'will', 'entertain', 'kids']",N/A

Once they meet up with Michael Caine, there is some ridiculous rivalry dialouge that doesn't fit well into the film. The special effects were good. The humor and story was aimed at the kids who enjoyed the picture far more than their parents with some scenes being downright juvenile. Sean, of course, has a thing for the island girl, who plays hard to get.

It's a family picture starring Dwayne Johnson popping his pecs, singing ""What a Wonderful World"" (with different lyrics), fighting an electric eel and riding a huge bee. (As for the last one, Sir Michael Caine does it, too.) The story of ""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,"" directed by Brad Peyton (""Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore""), is certainly corny, full of physically impossible moments, but somehow I enjoyed watching the film that is silly but entertaining.Very loosely based on a famous Jules Verne novel, ""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island"" chronicles the fun adventures of four characters crash landing on an uncharted island in the South Pacific. They are a 17-year-old American boy Sean (Josh Hutcherson, reprising the role he played in a 2008 movie ""Journey to the Center of the Earth""); Sean's step-father Hank (Dwayne Johnson); Gabato, a local tour guide in Palau (Luis Guzm&aacute;n) and Gabato's daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens).After one of the most incredible code cracking activities performed in the movie history, Sean and Hank have discovered that Sean's grandfather Alexander (Michael Caine), who has been missing for two years, is living on the mysterious island. Of course, they are right. The thin story is just a pretext for a loosely strung series of set pieces with special effects. The 94 minute film is a concoction of ideas possibly inspired by classic Swift / Stevenson novels and one legend everyone knows. (But didn't I write ""Pacific""?)The film is good, clean fun. There are no ""villains."" Just a monster lizard and other digitally rendered creatures. Shot in Hawaii, the location is very beautiful. Elephants are cute.

1536473,AP3B615GM191G,B007R6D74G,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","Because of the way that Pixar blurred the boundaries of adult vs. children's movies beginning with the ""Toy Story"" franchise, it is difficult to rate kiddie fare in this day and age.  In the case of ""Journey 2"", however, the verdict is quite clear: The kids will sit through this one, while the adults will be looking at their watches or hitting the concession stand.For a basic plot summary, ""Journey 2"" sees young adventurer Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and his step-dad Hank (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) travel to the Mysterious Island foretold by Jules Verne.  While on their way to rescue Sean's grandfather Alexander (Michael Caine), the pair is accompanied by a comedic-relief airplane pilot (Luis Guzman) and his beautiful young daughter (Vanessa Hudgens).There are some things that this film does get right: It most definitely covers all its bases.  Young boys will love Hudgens, Johnson has pretty much a universal appeal now, and  adults will smile to themselves at the presence of Caine.  The cringe-worthy comedy from Guzman is even well-done...when aimed at the kiddies, of course.  Plus, the visuals are stunning and the whole island adventure is magical.The trouble, of course, is that there is no plot development and only forced character growth.  In this way, it is very much geared for the minds of children.  Everything is predictable, and the characters act exactly as expected throughout.  Even the sappy message at the heart of the film is geared for the young minds.Thus, from an ""adult"" point of view, I would struggle to give this film two stars.  From the eyes of a child, however, there would be much more enjoyment (if not touching Pixar's level or anything like that, of course).  As such, this is a ""middle-of-the-road"" 3-star experience.  The visuals are nice and some of the characters are fun initially, but enjoying it any further requires a childhood perspective.",3,Adults Will Cringe; Kids Will Tolerate,1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,1893,"['way', 'Pixar', 'blurred', 'boundaries', 'adult', 'vs.', 'children', 'movies', 'beginning', 'Toy', 'Story', 'franchise', 'difficult', 'rate', 'kiddie', 'fare', 'day', 'age', 'case', 'Journey', '2', 'however', 'verdict', 'quite', 'clear', 'kids', 'will', 'sit', 'one', 'adults', 'will', 'be', 'looking', 'watches', 'hitting', 'concession', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Journey', '2', 'sees', 'young', 'adventurer', 'Sean', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'step-dad', 'Hank', 'Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'travel', 'Mysterious', 'Island', 'foretold', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'way', 'rescue', 'Sean', 'grandfather', 'Alexander', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'pair', 'accompanied', 'comedic-relief', 'airplane', 'pilot', 'Luis', 'Guzman', 'beautiful', 'young', 'daughter', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'are', 'things', 'film', 'get', 'right', 'most', 'definitely', 'bases', 'Young', 'boys', 'will', 'love', 'Hudgens', 'Johnson', 'pretty', 'much', 'universal', 'appeal', 'now', 'adults', 'will', 'smile', 'presence', 'Caine', 'cringe-worthy', 'comedy', 'Guzman', 'even', 'well-done', 'when', 'aimed', 'kiddies', 'course', 'visuals', 'are', 'stunning', 'whole', 'island', 'adventure', 'magical.The', 'trouble', 'course', 'plot', 'development', 'only', 'forced', 'character', 'growth', 'way', 'very', 'much', 'geared', 'minds', 'children', 'Everything', 'predictable', 'characters', 'act', 'exactly', 'expected', 'Even', 'sappy', 'message', 'heart', 'film', 'geared', 'young', 'minds.Thus', 'adult', 'point', 'view', 'would', 'struggle', 'give', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'eyes', 'child', 'however', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyment', 'not', 'touching', 'Pixar', 'level', 'anything', 'course', 'such', 'middle-of-the-road', '3-star', 'experience', 'visuals', 'are', 'nice', 'characters', 'are', 'fun', 'initially', 'enjoying', 'further', 'childhood', 'perspective']",N/A
