1362264,A340KVMHSQ9FG5,B003TNQ0WC,Lauren Noelle Clarke,"[5, 5]","First, the positives:  the routines in this DVD are awesome , music-video-quality steps that are appropriate (i.e. clean)--and challenging--for dancers of all ages.  The hit songs they picked are ones that kids are really going to like (and unlike adults, kids probably won't mind that they are sung by annoying Kidz Bop ""kidz"".)Now on to the negatives--the teaching sections move ridiculously fast.  Unless you constantly rewind or have a photographic memory, you are not going to memorize these routines to even remotely be able to follow along when the music comes on!  Secondly, the way the teaching sections are shot--so bright white that you can hardly see the dancers arms or hands and with the cameras swooping around--it's really a struggle to see what is even going on.  It looks ""cool"" but is not very practical to someone seriously trying to learn the dances.  Plus it's shot facing the dancers so when the instructor says ""left"" it's the right side of the screen (I just ignored which direction she said and mirrored the moves).It's hard to figure out who this DVD is even for.  The routines are so difficult and taught so fast only someone very diligent who hits the pause and rewind button a lot or a serious professional could do them.  Maybe kids could just like bop around to it?The only people I would recommend this DVD to are serious, advanced near-professional level dancers and instructors--there are plenty of cool moves to steal here--or to little kids that will dance around to anything.",2,"Great for pros and tots, not much here for in between",1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,1513,"['First', 'positives', 'routines', 'DVD', 'are', 'awesome', 'music-video-quality', 'steps', 'are', 'appropriate', 'i.e', 'clean', 'challenging', 'dancers', 'ages', 'hit', 'songs', 'picked', 'are', 'ones', 'kids', 'are', 'really', 'going', 'like', 'adults', 'kids', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mind', 'are', 'sung', 'annoying', 'Kidz', 'Bop', 'kidz', 'Now', 'negatives', 'teaching', 'sections', 'move', 'ridiculously', 'fast', 'constantly', 'rewind', 'have', 'photographic', 'memory', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'memorize', 'routines', 'even', 'remotely', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'along', 'when', 'music', 'Secondly', 'way', 'teaching', 'sections', 'are', 'shot', 'so', 'bright', 'white', 'can', 'hardly', 'see', 'dancers', 'arms', 'hands', 'cameras', 'swooping', 'around', 'really', 'struggle', 'see', 'what', 'even', 'going', 'cool', 'not', 'very', 'practical', 'someone', 'seriously', 'trying', 'learn', 'dances', 'shot', 'facing', 'dancers', 'so', 'when', 'instructor', 'left', 'right', 'side', 'screen', 'just', 'ignored', 'direction', 'said', 'mirrored', 'moves', '.It', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'DVD', 'even', 'routines', 'are', 'so', 'difficult', 'taught', 'so', 'fast', 'only', 'someone', 'very', 'diligent', 'who', 'pause', 'rewind', 'button', 'lot', 'serious', 'professional', 'could', 'do', 'Maybe', 'kids', 'could', 'just', 'like', 'bop', 'only', 'people', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'are', 'serious', 'advanced', 'near-professional', 'level', 'dancers', 'instructors', 'are', 'plenty', 'cool', 'moves', 'steal', 'here', 'little', 'kids', 'will', 'dance', 'anything']",N/A
