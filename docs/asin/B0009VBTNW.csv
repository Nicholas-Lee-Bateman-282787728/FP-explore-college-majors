913629,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B0009VBTNW,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","This is basically a film promoting a non-profit called Doctor's Gift. They go to places (in the story, Shanghai) and donate their expertise as plastic and reconstructive surgeons to fix some major disfigured faces.We have two stories running in parallel of two teenage girls who live a world apart in almost every sense, but share a birthday. There's Katie, a pretty blonde from Malibu, whose father is a psychiatrist and who has boys wrapped around her little finger. And there's Lin, in a small village near Shanghai, who was born with a major birth defect of her upper lip and gums. This is not just a harelip, but a more extreme distortion. She goes around wearing a blue veil heavy enough so no one can see through it, and in fact barely goes out of the house.In Katie's senior year at Malibu High, her school included a requirement for some kind of public service, and Katie's teacher had experience with Doctor's Gift. One of the things they do is accept American students as volunteers, giving them a chance to contribute their time and gain some experience. Katie was apparently struck by the fact that the file her teacher gave her (Lin's) showed they had the same birthday.It's a simple story, really, but a nice one. A rather spoiled young girl learns to care for someone other than herself. And a girl who was afraid to think of herself at all is transformed.",3,"Yes, Teenagers Can Do Wonderful Things",1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,1372,"['basically', 'film', 'promoting', 'non-profit', 'called', 'Doctor', 'Gift', 'go', 'places', 'story', 'Shanghai', 'donate', 'expertise', 'plastic', 'reconstructive', 'surgeons', 'fix', 'major', 'disfigured', 'faces.We', 'have', 'two', 'stories', 'running', 'parallel', 'two', 'teenage', 'girls', 'who', 'live', 'world', 'apart', 'almost', 'sense', 'share', 'birthday', 'Katie', 'pretty', 'blonde', 'Malibu', 'father', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'boys', 'wrapped', 'little', 'finger', 'Lin', 'small', 'village', 'Shanghai', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'major', 'birth', 'defect', 'upper', 'lip', 'gums', 'not', 'just', 'harelip', 'more', 'extreme', 'distortion', 'around', 'wearing', 'blue', 'veil', 'heavy', 'enough', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'fact', 'barely', 'house.In', 'Katie', 'senior', 'year', 'Malibu', 'High', 'school', 'included', 'requirement', 'kind', 'public', 'service', 'Katie', 'teacher', 'had', 'experience', 'Doctor', 'Gift', 'One', 'things', 'do', 'accept', 'American', 'students', 'volunteers', 'giving', 'chance', 'contribute', 'time', 'gain', 'experience', 'Katie', 'was', 'apparently', 'struck', 'fact', 'file', 'teacher', 'gave', 'Lin', 'showed', 'had', 'same', 'birthday.It', 'simple', 'story', 'really', 'nice', 'one', 'rather', 'spoiled', 'young', 'girl', 'care', 'someone', 'other', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'afraid', 'think', 'transformed']",Smile

He ends up raising her alone.When the 2 girls from different worlds finally meet, it is very touching,and Katie gives the girl, (Li) the courage to go through with the operation.This was just a very nice movie, one without sex and a lot of cussing,and unpleasant characters (except for the stepmom)It was just one of those movies that restore your faith in mankind.Very uplifting, and well acted, too.Also, it was filmed on location in China, so there is a BEAUTIFUL backdrop to a wonderful story!!!!I HIGHLY reccomend it!",5,A Pampered Princess learns a life lesson.,1168387200,"01 10, 2007",2007,1206,"['touching', 'story', 'spoiled', 'girl', 'Katie', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'family', 'who', 'out', 'school', 'project', 'where', 'handful', 'students', 'go', 'China', 'help', 'hospital', 'program', 'involving', 'pretty', 'disfigured', 'kids', 'going', 'surgeries.The', 'pictures', 'Katie', 'upsets', 'especially', 'one', 'girl', 'particular', 'who', 'shares', 'Birthday', 'go', 'group.Throughout', 'movie', 'also', 'see', 'glimpses', 'chinese', 'girl', 'life', 'very', 'sad.She', 'was', 'abandoned', 'infant', 'worker', 'found', 'raised', 'own.His', 'wife', 'became', 'outraged', 'instead', 'HELPING', 'orphan', 'girl', 'become', 'jealous', 'attention', 'man', 'up', 'raising', 'alone.When', '2', 'girls', 'different', 'worlds', 'finally', 'meet', 'very', 'touching', 'Katie', 'girl', 'Li', 'courage', 'go', 'operation.This', 'was', 'just', 'very', 'nice', 'movie', 'one', 'sex', 'lot', 'cussing', 'unpleasant', 'characters', 'stepmom', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'movies', 'restore', 'faith', 'mankind.Very', 'uplifting', 'well', 'acted', 'too.Also', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'China', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'backdrop', 'wonderful', 'story', 'HIGHLY', 'reccomend']",Smile

913635,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0009VBTNW,Grady Harp,"[5, 7]","SMILE is one of those Op-Ed moments on CNN that can be told with poignant dignity in 10 - 15 minutes and make a significant impact.  The trouble with SMILE, the motion picture, is that it stretches this idea into 107 padded minutes, incorporating far more sitcom TV dialog about wealthy families with strident children looking for ways to escape uninspiring parental role models with teenage sex life and outside causes.  It takes so long for this movie to get going that it loses the viewer.The strong elements lie in the concept of the parallel of two girls born on the same day, one to the wealthy Malibu family with everything but concord, an the other left as an unwanted deserted orphan because of a facial deformity, salvaged by a caring worker who raises her as his own.  The stories run parallel through the teen years when the Western girl seeks meaning to life by joining a humanitarian medical group whose efforts are directed toward offering the Eastern girl a chance at a normal appearance.  The comparison of the lives of the two girls and their disparate families is tender and meaningful and that alone is worth the effort to tell this tale.The actors are very good for the most part - Sean Astin in his most mature role to date, Mika Boorem as the Western girl and Yi Ding as the Eastern girl, and Beau Bridges and Luoyong Wang as the apposing fathers, Linda Hamilton as a rather tiresome mother, and some good young actors in supporting parts.  The cinematography in China is very lovely but there is little tie in with the California counterpart.  Jeffrey Kramer directs with less hold on pacing than on commitment to a worthwhile tale begging for brevity.

Not wishing to prejudice my viwing beforehand I persisted and was pleasantly surprised by the result.Be not mistaken, this is no earth shattering movie which will win artistic awards or even oscars.It is a feelgood, tugging at the heart-strings movie aimed at Western and westernized audiences,It tells the tale of two girls born on the same day an ocean apart who grow up leading very different lives. While for the girl of Malibu life is a breeze with comfort and success without struggle living in the parental home with two parents who fight and squabble but who nevertheless dote on their daughter, the other girl enjoys or endures a different experience. In China a girl is found abandoned with a facial disfigurement. She is discovered by a worker and taken home to be brought up alongside his wife and son. They leave after seven years when the husband resists his wife's demands to send the girl away. He selflessly devotes himself to her upbringing despite the difficulties while she hides herself away lierally in the house and by a veil when outside.The two come together through a community service project which takes Miss Malibu to China. Each learns a little about life on the other side of the tracks and good wins through until they all live happily ever after.Partly a propaganda movie the film plays on the emotions and we can all share in the pain and joy. We wonder what the disfigurement is until it is finally revealed near to the end of the movie. Despite this aspect to the movie it certainly had an impact on my children at home generating many questions about a whole gamut of areas. The scenes are touching and both my fifteen year old and eleven year old certainly got the moral of the story.Good wholesome fun for the family and although it is more than a little bit corny at times and also ham-fisted with obvious parallels it pays it's way.I don't normally recommend movies like this but on this accasion I am happy to do so for children of all ages.",4,"When you're smiling, when you're smiling the whole world smiles with you",1125792000,"09 4, 2005",2005,2041,"['first', 'reaction', 'seeing', 'cast', 'was', 'groan', 'inside', 'Not', 'wishing', 'prejudice', 'viwing', 'beforehand', 'persisted', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'result.Be', 'not', 'mistaken', 'earth', 'shattering', 'movie', 'will', 'win', 'artistic', 'awards', 'even', 'feelgood', 'tugging', 'heart-strings', 'movie', 'aimed', 'Western', 'westernized', 'audiences', 'tale', 'two', 'girls', 'born', 'same', 'day', 'ocean', 'apart', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'leading', 'very', 'different', 'lives', 'girl', 'Malibu', 'life', 'breeze', 'comfort', 'success', 'struggle', 'living', 'parental', 'home', 'two', 'parents', 'who', 'fight', 'squabble', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'dote', 'daughter', 'other', 'girl', 'different', 'experience', 'China', 'girl', 'found', 'abandoned', 'facial', 'disfigurement', 'discovered', 'worker', 'taken', 'home', 'be', 'brought', 'up', 'wife', 'son', 'leave', 'seven', 'years', 'when', 'husband', 'wife', 'demands', 'send', 'girl', 'away', 'selflessly', 'upbringing', 'difficulties', 'away', 'lierally', 'house', 'veil', 'when', 'outside.The', 'two', 'come', 'together', 'community', 'service', 'project', 'Miss', 'Malibu', 'China', 'little', 'life', 'other', 'side', 'tracks', 'good', 'wins', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.Partly', 'propaganda', 'movie', 'film', 'emotions', 'can', 'share', 'pain', 'joy', 'wonder', 'what', 'disfigurement', 'finally', 'revealed', 'end', 'movie', 'aspect', 'movie', 'certainly', 'had', 'impact', 'children', 'home', 'generating', 'many', 'questions', 'whole', 'gamut', 'areas', 'scenes', 'are', 'touching', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'eleven', 'year', 'old', 'certainly', 'got', 'moral', 'story.Good', 'wholesome', 'fun', 'family', 'more', 'little', 'bit', 'corny', 'times', 'also', 'ham-fisted', 'obvious', 'parallels', 'way.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'recommend', 'movies', 'accasion', 'am', 'happy', 'do', 'so', 'children', 'ages']",Smile
