She was attractive with the benefit of a common sense and life experience that flavored her character.Terence Howard did quite well.  The whiny voice did not fit the character he portrayed, but his actions fleshed out the trials of the washed up betrayed fighter turned promoter.If you are looking for a nice tepid movie with a bit of excitement and a nice underdog storyline I definitely recommend this movie.But if you are actually looking for a youthful fighting movie I would recommend Never Back Down.Cookie cutter as it may seem to some, the fight scenes and training scenes were pretty nice.I also recommend RedBelt for a more mature version of Fighting with a bit more of a darker and stronger feel.",3,Needed more actual fighting,1259020800,"11 24, 2009",2009,1455,"['movie', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'overall', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'was', 'believable', 'logical.The', 'acting', 'not', 'shining', 'was', 'decent', 'situations', 'represented.Gritty', 'urban', 'crowded', 'dirty', 'New', 'york', 'was', 'great', 'backdrop', 'type', 'movie.The', 'fight', 'scene', 'Dragon', 'Le', 'was', 'best', 'one', 'opinion.Shawn', 'brawler', 'style', 'was', 'good', 'contrast', 'Dragon', 'more', 'classically', 'oriented', 'style.This', 'fight', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'end', 'fight', 'lasted', 'longer.Or', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'fight', 'Evan', 'more', 'crisp', 'instead', 'unskilled', 'schoolyard', 'fight.The', 'fighters', 'breaking', 'down', 'walls', 'disturbing', 'guests', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'fact', 'was', 'contrived', 'uninspiring', 'final', 'match.I', 'liked', 'romantic', 'tension', 'Shawn', 'Zulay', 'was', 'attractive', 'benefit', 'common', 'sense', 'life', 'experience', 'flavored', 'character.Terence', 'Howard', 'did', 'quite', 'well', 'whiny', 'voice', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'character', 'portrayed', 'actions', 'fleshed', 'out', 'trials', 'washed', 'up', 'betrayed', 'fighter', 'turned', 'are', 'looking', 'nice', 'tepid', 'movie', 'bit', 'excitement', 'nice', 'underdog', 'storyline', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie.But', 'are', 'actually', 'looking', 'youthful', 'fighting', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'Never', 'Back', 'Down.Cookie', 'cutter', 'may', 'seem', 'fight', 'scenes', 'training', 'scenes', 'were', 'pretty', 'nice.I', 'also', 'recommend', 'RedBelt', 'more', 'mature', 'version', 'Fighting', 'bit', 'more', 'darker', 'stronger', 'feel']",N/A

1264585,A29QM4M1KVTWVF,B002E01LL6,Bitter Bunny,"[8, 10]","The main problem with a film like 'Fighting' is the expectations that come with the obvious - fighting, or fight sequences. Although the movie centers on fighting, it seems like attention was spent elsewhere. In other words, the filmmakers did not conceptualize intricate fight sequences that would leave Bruce Lee breathless. On the contrary, the fights here are very low brow, meat and potatoes, bare knuckle, anything goes kind of brawl, which I'm not opposed to whatsoever. Personally, every now and again, the over-orchestrating of fight sequences can be a bit too much for me, but the minimal aspects here lend quite nicely to the main character's plight to survive.As you've probably read the other reviews, the story surrounds the nicest small-time drifter once could ever hope to meet (quite a stretch I may add). He holds doors for strangers, pays fair prices for goods and aside from the funky smell & shabby clothes, you'd be proud to bring him home to mother for Thanksgiving dinner. Although money is the object of his desire, he struggles to keep the only thing he's got going for himself - his pride. Something from his past that has made him run but must soon face head on. Howard stars as a small time conman with connections but in his older age, he represents the road Tatum could be headed. He takes him under his wing, primarily for the potential of making plenty of dough but soon realizes that a life without dignity isn't worth much. For example, to Howard, throwing a fight seems like smart business-making but for Tatum it means letting go of your most fundamental values as a person.I enjoyed the movie for what it was worth although I could clearly see the potential for a deeper, more soulful searching between the characters. Although it failed to deliver the latter, it was consistently paced well. If you have some time to kill, not expecting to see anything remotely close to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, you like Terrence Howard or Channing Tatum (or dare I say like both of them), have washed your hair twice in one evening already and finished that 1500 piece jigsaw puzzle, then do give this a watch. I have seen better but I have definitely endured worse.On a minor note, I believe someone mentioned the love interest's mother as clich&eacute;'; I definitely agree although it was indeed her grandma, not her mom.",3,Fighting deserves a fighting chance...,1263427200,"01 14, 2010",2010,2354,"['main', 'problem', 'film', ""'Fighting"", 'expectations', 'come', 'obvious', 'fighting', 'fight', 'sequences', 'movie', 'centers', 'fighting', 'attention', 'was', 'spent', 'elsewhere', 'other', 'words', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'not', 'conceptualize', 'intricate', 'fight', 'sequences', 'would', 'leave', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'breathless', 'contrary', 'fights', 'here', 'are', 'very', 'low', 'brow', 'meat', 'potatoes', 'bare', 'knuckle', 'anything', 'kind', 'brawl', ""'m"", 'not', 'opposed', 'whatsoever', 'Personally', 'now', 'again', 'over-orchestrating', 'fight', 'sequences', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'minimal', 'aspects', 'here', 'lend', 'quite', 'nicely', 'main', 'character', 'plight', 'survive.As', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'story', 'nicest', 'small-time', 'drifter', 'once', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'meet', 'quite', 'stretch', 'may', 'add', 'doors', 'strangers', 'fair', 'prices', 'goods', 'aside', 'funky', 'smell', 'shabby', 'clothes', ""'d"", 'be', 'proud', 'bring', 'home', 'mother', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'money', 'object', 'desire', 'keep', 'only', 'thing', 'got', 'going', 'pride', 'Something', 'past', 'made', 'run', 'must', 'soon', 'face', 'head', 'Howard', 'small', 'time', 'conman', 'connections', 'older', 'age', 'road', 'Tatum', 'could', 'be', 'headed', 'wing', 'primarily', 'potential', 'making', 'plenty', 'dough', 'soon', 'life', 'dignity', ""n't"", 'worth', 'much', 'example', 'Howard', 'throwing', 'fight', 'smart', 'business-making', 'Tatum', 'letting', 'go', 'most', 'fundamental', 'values', 'person.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'what', 'was', 'worth', 'could', 'clearly', 'see', 'potential', 'deeper', 'more', 'soulful', 'searching', 'characters', 'failed', 'deliver', 'latter', 'was', 'consistently', 'paced', 'well', 'have', 'time', 'kill', 'not', 'expecting', 'see', 'anything', 'remotely', 'close', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'like', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'dare', 'say', 'have', 'washed', 'hair', 'twice', 'one', 'evening', 'already', 'finished', '1500', 'piece', 'jigsaw', 'puzzle', 'then', 'do', 'give', 'watch', 'have', 'seen', 'better', 'have', 'definitely', 'endured', 'worse.On', 'minor', 'note', 'believe', 'someone', 'mentioned', 'love', 'interest', 'mother', 'clich', 'eacute', 'definitely', 'agree', 'was', 'indeed', 'grandma', 'not', 'mom']",N/A

But it is executed very well, has some pretty good fighting scenes, above-average acting (yes, even Tatum is good here), and a slight homage to the New York noirs of the 1970s (think Panic in Needle Park or Dog Day Afternoon).

1264591,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002E01LL6,Grady Harp,"[1, 4]","Dito Montiel ('A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints') has a sense of the raw flavor of the streets of New York and he is apparently respected enough to have actors of the quality of Terrence Howard and Luis Guzm&aacute;n sign on to his projects. His latest release on DVD is FIGHTING (co-written with Robert Munic), a rather tepid film trying hard to be a piece of verismo.  The story is so overused that it no longer can maintain an audience's interest: the outcome of the film is guessed within the first few minutes.  Briefly, Shawn MacArthur (model and type cast actor Channing Tatum)  works the streets of New York around Radio Music Hall, selling ripoff copies of books and gadgets to tourists.  He is involved in a fight, observed by the quiet scam artist Harvey Boarden (a wasted role for Terrence Howard) and by a young girl Zulay (Zulay Henao), and while Shawn's eye fixes on Zulay, Harvey's eye is on Shawn's possibilities as a 'fight for money' partner.  Shawn moves in with Harvey, develops a relationship with Zulay, and proceeds to win fights for money, until he is asked to fix a fight - a bit of conscience blurring created by a clash with his own father and the proposed opponent Evan Hailey (Brian White) - and ends his 'career' in a way we can all imagine.One would suppose we should care about the relationship between Shawn and Harvey and how mutually saprophytic it becomes, but the script gets in the way of having us care about anyone in the film - with the possible exception of Zulay's abuela (Altagracia Guzm&aacute;n), a little cameo that almost make the rest of the film worth watching. This is one of those movies that promises a lot but simply cannot deliver more than a dreary rehash of street fight movies.

1264592,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002E01LL6,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","So now we know that Tatum Channing is not only a terrific dancer, he's a fighter, as well. If he were more of an actor, he'd be a hell of a triple threat. Looks like the movie industry has tapped Channing to be the next cinematic heartthrob. And he's got the drop dead good looks, the athletic build, and the swagger to pull it off. FIGHTING takes him back to what he seems to do best, which is playing these sulky but good-hearted street hip kids. Here, his character actually hails from Birmingham, Alabama, but as the movie opens he's scammed in NYC long enough to have become wise to the hard knock life.When longtime street hustler Harvey Boarden (Terrence Howard) stumbles onto Shawn MacArthur (Channing), Shawn's been barely making do by foisting shady merchandise on unwary pedestrians. Seeing Shawn handle himself in a fight, Harvey takes him under his wing and introduces him to the underground fight circuit, becoming his manager. And that's pretty much the gist of it. The formulaic plot eases down its predictable track, and when, in the climax, the question looms over whether Shawn will throw the big fight, well, what do you think? If you've seenGladiator(with James Marshall and Cuba Gooding, Jr.) and Van Damme'sLionheart, then you're familiar with the blueprint.Films like this, more than ever it hinges on the acting performances, and also because this is more a character study than an action piece. Terrence Howard is a good actor, although sometimes he's so low key that it borders on listless. He doesn't do anything for me here. Good thing then that this flick's more about Tatum Channing. Channing reverts to his patented brooding, not-speaking-a-lot-of-lines thing that he does, but at least he does that pretty well. I'm not sure if he has charisma, but he's got this vibe about him. Also very easy on the eyes is the smoking hot and very good Zulay Henao. She makes the most of her time onscreen, gracefully avoiding all those possible pitfalls assumed with her struggling single mom/nightclub waitress character (whose name is also Zulay). How can you not fall for her? Zulay and Tatum look very good together, and there's a spark and a sweetness in their romance. But one of the few things up in the air about this story is just what is going on with Zulay and Shawn's manager, Harvey? It's certainly a no-brainer that Shawn will go kabonkers when he finds out about this. Although, this is one of those contrived plot devices which could've been easily resolved early on by Zulay simply filling Shawn in about her history with Harvey.Having checked out the trailer, I thought there'd be more fighting. But Shawn only fights four times in the circuit, and they weren't all that. One of them, though, is with showy mixed martial artist Cung Le, and I'm still trying to figure out how Cung Le lost that one. Skills wise, well, Tatum Channing doesn't have any, really. His character has a school wrestling background, and that's pretty much his style, which is very raw. He bobs and weaves and throws punches, but when push comes to shove, the boy will resort to his ground game. I like that he stays a raw brawler, that he doesn't all of a sudden become this smooth, highly skilled operator. In most of those fights, Shawn is a hair's breath away from getting his head handed to him. That he wins is more because of his big heart and, sometimes, because of sheer luck. I like that the fights are short and brutal (and I wish they were more brutal). Otherwise, feh.The longstanding concensus is that New York City is the most kinetic place to shoot city scenes. FIGHTING captures the urban vibe, the bustling, gritty, jive-ridden energy of NYC, and it looks as if every cat on the avenue is either working on a hustle or else is getting worked on.The DVD doesn't really come with a lot of bonus features. There are five deleted scenes (totaling 8 minutes), including an alternative second meeting between Shawn and Zulay. This gives me one more chance to ogle the sexy Zulay Henao who, with mad respect to Tatum Channing, is the highlight of the movie for me. Zulay Henao's brand of sexy and really good performance hike my rating up to 2.5 out of 5 stars. FIGHTING is a nice rental. I'm not sure that I'd buy the DVD.",3,"""Whatever goes on up here - whatever.

1264602,A27JAIYP0U9FGH,B002E01LL6,PJR,"[5, 6]","Fight films are not my thing. They have been done and done and done. I mostly watched this film because I just saw Channing Tatum in the Eagle (first time ever for this actor) and thought he did well but was curious to see how he might do in a film with some dramatic potential. He did just fine in Fighting in my opinion and showed much more range (because more range was called for) than in the Eagle. I think he has charisma and a lot of potential for good roles in the future.What surprised me was how good the script was in Fighting and how fresh the acting was of some of the supporting actors. This was more like an indy film than a regular Hollywood or Hong Kong fight film. I especially liked the supporting actor who was a very engaging character.The dialogue was not lofty, but it was realistic and ""authentic"" and thus atmospheric. All in all Fighting was a refreshing break from the usual fight films and for me at least, a ""real film about people"" and not just genre. Of course in this respect it may be very disappointing for viewers who want genre films that compete to top each other.I will say on the negative side that Tatum was hyped in the film as a fighting white college student, yet he did not fit any stereotype of a college student. This bothered some reviewers and I must say I had to work to remember that a lot of college students in real life actually do not come across as any more sophisticated in manners or speech  than he does. He comes across almost as sort of a bumkin, though with some good sense. This is not truly unrealistic, but it is not close to a stereotype of college students in a serious film. So I won't fault it for this. I watched the Blu Ray and it had minimal extras.

However, if you want an uplifting story with some good acting and a few fights thrown in... Welcome! I gave it four stars out of five for its entertaining value, rather then the artistic achievement (for that it would have been two stars only).Based on the title, I expected roughly 90 minutes filled with an assortment of muscle bound men who tried to kill one another in creative ways (and what's better to relieve the stress of a long day in the office?). Instead, what followed was a charming story about an underdog who wins in the end, and, of course, gets the girl. The story is not new. And yet, such is man's hunger for the uplifting value of the tale, that we continue to crave it, and I'm sure will do so for millennia to come.The strong point of the film were its lead performances, particularly that of Terrence Howard's as Harvey, the hero's street wise, but vulnerable and down on his luck, handler. The hero, Channing Tatum (Shawn the Street Fighter), should have worked harder pre-movie to build a believable street fighter physique. As he was, one had to engage the suspension of disbelief quite frequently in order to ""buy"" his supposed fighting prowess. In real life, anyone betting on him to win would have had to be either drunk, or his mother. However, what Tatum lacked in muscle power, he more then made up for with his charm. The chemistry between the three leads (with Zulay Henoy as...Zulay, the love interest) carried the story.So, what was missing? Motives are always important to the viewer. But, it seemed the writers had spent very little time coming up with good ones. Extra few minutes of work on their part could have saved me from having to work extra hard on developing empathy for the hero (yes, I'm a lazy viewer; for $9.00 plus cost of popcorn and soda I want it handed to me). Secondly, the fight scenes could have been better. Aside from Tatum's toothpick appearance, I felt the visual potential and the high energy charge of a no holds barred match were never fully realized. Inexplicable, given the talent Hollywood seems to have on its beck and call these days. I felt the creators shortchanged themselves by not fully utilizing Tatum's opponents, mainly Yuri Foreman, a real life professional boxer, and Cung Le, a world class martial arts champion.Overall though, I am pleased I saw ""Fighting"".

His speech was really slow as if even before he even started fighting, he took one to many blows to the head.  And he couldn't even fight.  He only won his first fight by knocking a guys head into some kind of fountain. He couldn't even beat that big guy. Oh and don't get me started on the fight against the chinese guy; three time world champion Cung Le.  Even without me knowing who Cung Le was I could see that Channing's character was no match for him.  The only good scenes in this movie was when he fought Evan in the end and when they won all that money.

1264613,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B002E01LL6,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[9, 13]","Movies about the shady world of underground fighting and gambling have been done to death; director/writer Dito Montiel's ""FIGHTING"" is another entry into this overused genre. Ok, so what made me sit through this film? Well, I am a sucker for fight sequences and I do believe that such a stereotypical movie can shine when the fight scenes themselves take center stage. Channing Tatum may not be the best actor for the role and admittedly the man isn't known for his acting skills, but he does 'look' the role of the underdog; that, combined with the fact that Montiel brings a lively feel and look of a contemporary New York City--oh, I also like watching fight scenes.Shawn McArthur (Channing Tatum) hails from Birmingham, Alabama who comes to the Big Apple to make a living selling bootleg books, CDs and DVDs. Shawn is desperate to make a big score and when he crosses paths with a more experienced hustler in the person of Harvey Broaden (Terrence Howard) after a fight with his associates, Shawn gets recruited to participate in bare knuckle fights for some major money. Somewhere along the way, Shawn meets up with Evan Hailey (Brian White); a man from his past who supposedly trained with him in his father's wrestling school. Shawn is determined to make the big score; whatever it takes...The film's premise is undoubtedly unimaginative and completely routine. While Montiel does bring try to bring a lively atmosphere in this world of shady characters composed of hustlers, gamblers and underground fighters in New York's shadowy corners, he has so little cards in his hands. Sure, he does bring the sights of New York in the composition as with ""Saints"", but the characters in this film are pretty stereotypical and feel like mere caricatures of what they may (should) have been. It is full of shady, intimidating dark figures that are in it for greed and angry heroes with issues complete with `macho-posturing'. It borrows heavily from elements established by ""Lionheart"" and the 1975 classic ""Hard Times"".Montiel attempts to bring the relationship between Harvey and Shawn into bear but he is severely hampered by the screenplay that offers little to no surprises. The problem is that the film telegraphs its punches way too soon, and it misses several opportunities; the subplot with Shawn's father is never given any room to develop and the rivalry between Evan and Shawn isn't fully utilized--they felt like they were just using the usual practices of machismo. The only good character that adds some twist is in the person of Zulay (Zulay Henao) who plays Shawn's love interest. The script tries to promote a moody, realistic and seedy feel, and while it does on some level, it just couldn't capitalize on what its got.Ok, so this film isn't going to win any Oscars, but a film like this can stay aloft when the fights are brutal and fresh. Well, Montiel does give the fights a somewhat realistic feel, they are messy and in this unrated cut, a bit more violent and longer (with 2 minutes of added footage). They are shot in a manner that keeps the action close, playing on the facial expressions of the fighters to express emotion. Some of the fights did manage to provoke my interest, as they became harder with more seasoned opponents but I thought the movie could've used more fights to serve in its build up and to invest on Shawn's reputation in the fighting arena. Also, I thought Shawn's fight with the Asian fighter was the best one. Still, being an action junkie, I have seen a lot of superb fight scenes; beautifully choreographed as well as simple realistic ones--the fights in ""Fighting"" offers nothing fresh and are just OK. But for a film that should focus on the brutal encounters, ""OK"" just doesn't cut it. It left me nothing to look forward to, and I could just predict on how everything would turn out.The acting is a mixed bag. Tatum is a good-looking actor, (or so my lady friends say) but his skills as a performer is mediocre at best. There is a subway training scene that gives his character some intensity but we've all seen it better. The chemistry between Howard and Tatum feels forced as all it seemed that the two shared are stares and a contest of who gets to mumble more effectively. Zulay Henao (I love that first name) is charming and very attractive; her love scenes with Tatum are filled with the usual `holding hands' during love making. The idea of the twist as to what her relationship with Harvey had promise but it made no impact on its narrative. Evan Hailey (played by White) felt too averaged as the main antagonist and acts more like a high school bully than a fighter with a fearsome record.""Fighting"" should have been grittier and more violent to achieve the character's depth as an underdog and for the hero's fortitude to be felt. The film's screenplay tries but never quite reaches its goal because of its weak script; you can just feel that it went on its journey but it never reached its destination. ""Fighting"" is just a bare-knuckled flick that would not inflict damage to other films in this genre. Overall, ""Fighting"" is a just a mediocre urban melodrama.Rent it!
