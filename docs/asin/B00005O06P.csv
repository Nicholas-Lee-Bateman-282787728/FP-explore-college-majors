Christopher Walken's motley crew of professional killers was the A-Team before the A-Team--and more realistic to boot.I won't go too much into the plot, suffice it to say that this movie is one of Walken's top 10 in regards to performance and characterization. What's not discussed in the movie is that Walken's character is clearly a Vietnam Veteran. Too, in his apartment we see (In The Background) his medals (Including What Appears To Be A Purple Heart) hanging on his wall.The fictional African country of Zangara is the setting for this movie. When Walken is discovered as a spy he is brutallly beaten and then deported. Vowing revenge, Walken organizes a merc group to overthrow the sadistical dictator of the country. His group succede in toppling the dictator, but instead of replacing a madman with a lunatic, he goes the more humane route, and puts Dr. Okoye in the presidency.  Fantastic!Get this movie on DVD.

Chow,"[6, 6]","`The Dogs of War' is a cold warrior classic forgotten.I still remember the frightening sight of the VHS cover, a painting of Walken's frightening face gripping a revolving grenade launcher, greeting me at the video store. I never saw it, always assuming it was merely Vietnam War backwash resulting from `The Deer Hunter.' I was completely wrong, sand deeply regret missing `The Dogs of War' all these years.Based on Fredrick Forsyth's best selling cold warrior novel of the same title, `The Dogs of War' focus on a single great raid battle with wide reaching elements of drama. Mercenary Shannon (Christopher Walken) is hired by British industrialists to overthrow a stereotypical African dictatorship. 75% percent of the film involves the planning of a single great victory. The planning is filled with excitement as Walken and co mercenaries, including Tom Berenger and Ed O'Neal scavenge Europe of equipment. Their arsenal includes Uzis, rocket launchers, claymores, and new unique on unforgettable revolving grenade launchers. An advanced weapon still only now 27 years later making it to the battlefield.The climactic battle is one of the most memorable blitzkriegs in movie history.Christopher Walken's performance takes us back to when his frightening face and demeanor were used for fear, not comedy.

670981,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00005O06P,C. O. DeRiemer,"[21, 25]","""Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war,"" wrote one of those old, white male Eurocentric writers a long time ago, and this movie shows how it can be done. I think it's a solid, fast-paced adventure story with a nice, jaundiced outlook and a first-rate performance by Christopher Walken.Jamie Shannon (Walken) is a pay-for-play mercenary who has reached the point where he's just seen too much. His private life has disintegrated. His wife has divorced him, although he, in his own way, still loves her. He lives in a worn out New York apartment where he keeps a revolver in the refrigerator and the black and white TV on all the time. He's hired by a big, multinational company to check out Zangora, an African country rich in resources and ruled by a brutal but wily and slightly insane dictator. The question Jamie is asked to answer: Are the conditions ripe enough for a coup to succeed? Jamie goes there, but is caught and beaten within an inch of his life, then deported. On his return, his answer to the company is simple: A coup isn't possible; the army is corrupt and second rate, but they still are loyal to President Kimba. The company then asks Jamie: How about the chances of success for a well-financed, well supplied overthrow led by a first-class group of mercenaries, led by Jamie Shannon? After some angst involving an unsuccessful attempt to reconnect with his ex-wife, Jamie says it could work and he'll do it.The middle of the movie shows us how to recruit our own group of mercenaries, get arms and money out of one country and into another, and then plan and carry out a meticulous and violent attack against a poorly led and larger army. And it does it with economy and a surprising amount of tension and interest. During recruitment and planning, Jamie finds himself beginning to question the motives of his employer and rediscovering some values of his own. Jamie Shannon is a ruthless and efficient hired gun, but he begins to see that what he has spent his life becoming may not be want he wants, after all. The movie ends with a nice, violent twist. Although satisfying, we're still left uncertain if Jamie will be able to break out of his way of life.I thought this movie kept things moving very well, even during the obligatory development of Shannon's back story and the time spent establishing his relationship with his ex-wife. Christopher Walken, looking very young, carries off the role with style and feeling. He has already perfected that slightly off-kilter stare, plus he's a fine actor. Tom Berenger plays his buddy, Drew, whom Shannon recruits to be his second in command. Nice jobs are turned in by Hugh Millais, who plays the multi-national corporation's amoral, can-do representative, and by Winston Ntshona as Dr. Okoye, a prisoner Shannon encounters in the Zangora prison after he's caught during his first visit. It's a small part, but the role is a major pivot point for the movie.On balance, I think this is a very good adventure movie with a cynical edge and a fine Walken performance. The DVD picture looks just fine.",4,"Violent, Cynical And Well Done",1118361600,"06 10, 2005",2005,3069,"['Cry', 'havoc', 'let', 'slip', 'dogs', 'war', 'wrote', 'one', 'old', 'white', 'male', 'Eurocentric', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'movie', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'think', 'solid', 'fast-paced', 'adventure', 'story', 'nice', 'jaundiced', 'outlook', 'first-rate', 'performance', 'Christopher', 'Walken.Jamie', 'Shannon', 'Walken', 'pay-for-play', 'mercenary', 'who', 'reached', 'point', 'where', 'just', 'seen', 'too', 'much', 'private', 'life', 'disintegrated', 'wife', 'divorced', 'own', 'way', 'still', 'worn', 'out', 'New', 'York', 'apartment', 'where', 'revolver', 'refrigerator', 'black', 'white', 'TV', 'time', 'hired', 'big', 'multinational', 'company', 'check', 'out', 'Zangora', 'African', 'country', 'rich', 'resources', 'ruled', 'brutal', 'wily', 'slightly', 'insane', 'dictator', 'question', 'Jamie', 'asked', 'answer', 'Are', 'conditions', 'ripe', 'enough', 'coup', 'succeed', 'Jamie', 'there', 'caught', 'beaten', 'inch', 'life', 'then', 'deported', 'return', 'answer', 'company', 'simple', 'coup', ""n't"", 'possible', 'army', 'corrupt', 'second', 'rate', 'still', 'are', 'loyal', 'President', 'Kimba', 'company', 'then', 'Jamie', 'How', 'chances', 'success', 'well-financed', 'well', 'supplied', 'overthrow', 'led', 'first-class', 'group', 'mercenaries', 'led', 'Jamie', 'Shannon', 'angst', 'involving', 'unsuccessful', 'attempt', 'reconnect', 'ex-wife', 'Jamie', 'could', 'work', ""'ll"", 'do', 'it.The', 'middle', 'movie', 'how', 'recruit', 'own', 'group', 'mercenaries', 'get', 'arms', 'money', 'one', 'country', 'then', 'plan', 'carry', 'out', 'meticulous', 'violent', 'attack', 'poorly', 'led', 'larger', 'army', 'economy', 'surprising', 'amount', 'tension', 'interest', 'recruitment', 'planning', 'Jamie', 'beginning', 'question', 'motives', 'employer', 'rediscovering', 'values', 'own', 'Jamie', 'Shannon', 'ruthless', 'efficient', 'hired', 'gun', 'see', 'what', 'spent', 'life', 'becoming', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'want', 'movie', 'nice', 'violent', 'twist', 'satisfying', ""'re"", 'still', 'left', 'uncertain', 'Jamie', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'break', 'way', 'life.I', 'thought', 'movie', 'kept', 'things', 'moving', 'very', 'well', 'even', 'obligatory', 'development', 'Shannon', 'back', 'story', 'time', 'spent', 'establishing', 'relationship', 'ex-wife', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'looking', 'very', 'young', 'role', 'style', 'feeling', 'already', 'perfected', 'slightly', 'off-kilter', 'stare', 'fine', 'actor', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'buddy', 'Drew', 'whom', 'Shannon', 'be', 'second', 'command', 'Nice', 'jobs', 'are', 'turned', 'Hugh', 'Millais', 'who', 'multi-national', 'corporation', 'amoral', 'can-do', 'representative', 'Winston', 'Ntshona', 'Dr.', 'Okoye', 'prisoner', 'Shannon', 'Zangora', 'prison', 'caught', 'first', 'visit', 'small', 'part', 'role', 'major', 'pivot', 'point', 'movie.On', 'balance', 'think', 'very', 'good', 'adventure', 'movie', 'cynical', 'edge', 'fine', 'Walken', 'performance', 'DVD', 'picture', 'just', 'fine']",N/A

The corporation decides that a new leader is needed, but Walken and his crew have other things on their minds, leading to an unexpected (and believable) ending.The best thing about this film is that it just shows the events without restorting to simplistic, ""this is bad"" tones that mar many Hollywood films.  The film has no easy answers and poses no easy questions.  It just shows you how coups occur, why they occur, and what happens after they're done.

It's a movie for god's sake!And as a movie, The Dogs of War is excellent. It comes under the rubric of action-suspense. Much of it is taken up with the suspense leading to a brilliant action pay-off. Christopher Walken is terrific. He is a unique blend of delicacy of look but ruthlessness of manner, much like Edward Fox's anti-hero of Day of the Jackal, also by Frederick Forsyth. The supporting cast is perfect. Though some think the movie drags, I think all the sequences were useful in developing character (Walken's) and story. The detailed look we get of the formation of a mercenary venture is fascinating. The cinematography is brilliant, thanks to the great Jack Cardiff. The special effects are quite realistic, i.e. realistic enough not to be a distraction.And here's my favorite quality of this movie: It's perhaps the most realistic, most chilling portrait of a fetid, corrupt and depraved African country I have ever seen. It should be noted that the model is Equatorial Guinea, the location of a real coup in 2004 and, more important, a coup, in 1973, in which Forsyth himself participated.The Dogs of War is one of the best movies of its genre and perhaps the best movie about mercenaries ever.",5,Great action-suspense and best mercenary movie ever,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,1317,"['negative', 'reviews', 'also', 'read', 'Dogs', 'War', 'yes', 'condensation', 'be', 'movie', 'god', 'sake', 'movie', 'Dogs', 'War', 'excellent', 'rubric', 'action-suspense', 'Much', 'taken', 'up', 'suspense', 'leading', 'brilliant', 'action', 'pay-off', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'terrific', 'unique', 'blend', 'delicacy', 'look', 'ruthlessness', 'manner', 'much', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'anti-hero', 'Day', 'Jackal', 'also', 'Frederick', 'Forsyth', 'supporting', 'cast', 'perfect', 'think', 'movie', 'drags', 'think', 'sequences', 'were', 'useful', 'developing', 'character', 'Walken', 'story', 'detailed', 'look', 'get', 'formation', 'mercenary', 'venture', 'fascinating', 'cinematography', 'brilliant', 'thanks', 'great', 'Jack', 'Cardiff', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'realistic', 'i.e', 'realistic', 'enough', 'not', 'be', 'distraction.And', 'here', 'favorite', 'quality', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'most', 'realistic', 'most', 'chilling', 'portrait', 'fetid', 'corrupt', 'depraved', 'African', 'country', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'model', 'Equatorial', 'Guinea', 'location', 'real', 'coup', '2004', 'more', 'important', 'coup', '1973', 'Forsyth', 'participated.The', 'Dogs', 'War', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'genre', 'perhaps', 'best', 'movie', 'mercenaries', 'ever']",N/A

It's a portrayal of the life of mercenaries, pawns in the larger global game of power and profits, seen through the experiences of the character played by Christopher Walken.  Its specific focus is a coup d'&eacute;tat in Africa that must be executed by a clandestine force, necessarily commissioned outside the official channels of government.  From its earliest stages, all aspects of the mission are rife with mortal danger, a typical reflection of the political forces vying to maintain their own interests. A veteran of similar assaults, Walken's character is contacted to organize and implement the project. It could be just another assignment for him, but this one is different; his most recent experience has left him disillusioned. He is still the grizzled, jaded soldier of fortune who is well-honed for task, but he's now hoping perhaps that this particular job may be his last. We therefore get not only a story of military conflict but one of a personal struggle as well.The other film's strengths are its aversion to stereotypes and straw men.  This is not the stuff of Chuck Norris or Sylvester Stallone. We are not subjected to distorted combat scenes where the hero wins the battle with one hand and the enemy is a stupid, sub-human dreg. Rather, we get a sense of the uncertainty of survival, of the brutal reality of life and death under unusual and exceptional circumstances. Within that context, the lines between good and evil, hero and villain, are blurred.  Questions concerning loyalty and principle are posed. Who, in fact, is right? Who should win- and does it matter? Can the employer be trusted or even the other men in the unit?This is as good a movie as there is in the genre. Walken's performance is compelling, bolstered by an excellent supporting cast (including an unexpectedly good showing from Tom Berenger). Fine direction of graphic action scenes ensures that the tempo does not drag, but balanced against that is insightful and sensitive dialogue.

It was also the last significant attempt to turn Christopher Walken into a mainstream leading man in the Brando mould on the back of his Deer Hunter Oscar, with the trailer and marketing almost ignoring co-stars Tom Berenger and, despite delivering the film's best performance as a cynical documentary filmmaker, Colin Blakely. Certainly Walken takes a beating as convincingly as Brando, though the public weren't biting in 1981.Frederick Forsyth's novel gained much notoriety due to the excessive lengths he went to in researching it - few writers would actually invest in a hastily abandoned African coup d'etat to get the inside details right, though it seems Forsyth did just that. As a result, the film goes to great lengths to stress its veracity, with director John Irvin, still hot after the success of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, adopting the stripped-down near documentary style that served Fred Zinnemann so well with The Day of the Jackal. Irvin's subsequent work would sadly mark him out as one of the flattest action directors in the business, but here - perhaps leaning on the experience of cinematographer Jack Cardiff, who also directed Dark of the Sun - he delivers the goods surprisingly effectively. Underneath all the gritty pseudo-realism it's a very familiar story (Winston Ntshona practically plays the same role here as an imprisoned deposed president that he did in the more Boys' Own The Wild Geese three years earlier), but it's well told - or at least in the two-hour European cut of the film which, perversely, is only available on DVD in the US, and there in a version with dodgy synchronisation in the early scenes: Europe has to make do with the cut US version shorn of 16 minutes. Geoffrey Burgon's score makes good use of A.E. Housman's Epitaph On An Army of Mercenaries while among the familiar faces in the supporting cast can be spotted Paul Freeman, Ed O'Neill, Jim Broadbent (as one of Blakely's film crew), Victoria Tennant and an unbilled Helen Shaver, though aside from Blakely, the standout performance probably comes from Hugh Millais' cold-fish middle man.Once again, bear in mind that the US NTSC DVD is the uncut European version of the film, while the UK PAL DVD is the cut US version!",3,Cry havoc...,1203120000,"02 16, 2008",2008,2511,"['Dogs', 'War', 'part', 'subgenre', 'war', 'movies', 'briefly', 'blossomed', 'late-sixties', 'seventies', 'found', 'little', 'favor', 'subsequent', 'years', 'story', 'ageing', 'mercenary', 'who', 'crisis', 'conscience', 'Dark', 'Sun', 'Wild', 'Geese', 'Savior', 'etc', 'was', 'also', 'last', 'significant', 'attempt', 'turn', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'mainstream', 'leading', 'man', 'Brando', 'mould', 'back', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'Oscar', 'trailer', 'marketing', 'almost', 'ignoring', 'co-stars', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'delivering', 'film', 'best', 'performance', 'cynical', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'Colin', 'Blakely', 'Certainly', 'Walken', 'beating', 'as', 'convincingly', 'Brando', 'public', 'were', ""n't"", 'biting', '1981.Frederick', 'Forsyth', 'novel', 'gained', 'much', 'notoriety', 'due', 'excessive', 'lengths', 'went', 'researching', 'few', 'writers', 'would', 'actually', 'invest', 'hastily', 'abandoned', 'African', 'coup', ""d'etat"", 'get', 'inside', 'details', 'right', 'Forsyth', 'did', 'just', 'that', 'result', 'film', 'great', 'lengths', 'stress', 'veracity', 'director', 'John', 'Irvin', 'still', 'hot', 'success', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'adopting', 'stripped-down', 'documentary', 'style', 'served', 'Fred', 'Zinnemann', 'so', 'well', 'Day', 'Jackal', 'Irvin', 'subsequent', 'work', 'would', 'sadly', 'mark', 'out', 'one', 'flattest', 'action', 'directors', 'business', 'here', 'perhaps', 'leaning', 'experience', 'cinematographer', 'Jack', 'Cardiff', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Dark', 'Sun', 'goods', 'surprisingly', 'effectively', 'gritty', 'pseudo-realism', 'very', 'familiar', 'story', 'Winston', 'Ntshona', 'practically', 'same', 'role', 'here', 'imprisoned', 'deposed', 'president', 'did', 'more', 'Boys', 'Own', 'Wild', 'Geese', 'three', 'years', 'earlier', 'well', 'told', 'least', 'two-hour', 'European', 'cut', 'film', 'perversely', 'only', 'available', 'DVD', 'US', 'there', 'version', 'dodgy', 'synchronisation', 'early', 'scenes', 'Europe', 'make', 'do', 'cut', 'US', 'version', 'shorn', '16', 'minutes', 'Geoffrey', 'Burgon', 'score', 'good', 'use', 'A.E', 'Housman', 'Epitaph', 'Army', 'Mercenaries', 'familiar', 'supporting', 'cast', 'can', 'be', 'spotted', 'Paul', 'Freeman', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'one', 'Blakely', 'film', 'crew', 'Victoria', 'Tennant', 'unbilled', 'Helen', 'Shaver', 'aside', 'Blakely', 'standout', 'performance', 'probably', 'Hugh', 'Millais', 'cold-fish', 'middle', 'man.Once', 'again', 'bear', 'mind', 'US', 'NTSC', 'DVD', 'uncut', 'European', 'version', 'film', 'UK', 'PAL', 'DVD', 'cut', 'US', 'version']",N/A
