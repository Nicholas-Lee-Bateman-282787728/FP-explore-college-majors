348814,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6302970040,Austin Somlo,"[1, 2]","Viewed: 7/11Rate: 87/11: I remember how shocking Flowers in the Attic was when it came out as a novel. Then, there was the sinister film by an adaption on the book. It's been over two decades since I last saw it, and I still remember how dark the film was. That was the biggest anticipation around it. Watching it again last night brought back the memories, and it was almost a masterpiece except for a minor problem. How freaking stupid could the children be??? So they said that Christopher will become a medical doctor. My butt...he was so moronic that he should be slinging hash browns at McDonald's. Obviously, I would have known that things were seriously wrong within a few days of being locked up in a room. By the time the same food was being arrived every single day, I would be out of the house pronto. Things couldn't be any more clear. I knew that they could have escaped through the door because the door freaking opened to inside of the room, meaning just unloose the damn pins and make an escape. Ok, fine...the dogs...well, there must be a working phone somewhere in the house. So, call the cops...go back to the same room and hide or search more of the house for possible weapons...and wait for them to come before revealing myself. Or better yet, just hit everybody with sticks and beat them unconsciously enough to roam around the house. It just couldn't be that hard enough. Finally, get some meat and soak it in antifreeze to kill the dogs off before escaping. I was also just thinking...why didn't the mother get a job? Honestly... Despite the idiocy of the children, I still liked the film for its dark nature, and that sort of thing still does happen nowadays: children being locked up in the house for years and being starved. So, it's a sad sight to see. I thought Louise Fletcher gave a great villainous performance which would make her the central focus of revisiting Flowers in the Attic from time to time.

I have news for you- the movie is going to be inferior to the book *every single time* no matter WHAT type of movie it is.  Horror, drama, suspense, you name it.  The book is going to be better, that's a fact.That's why whenever you're planning to see a movie version of a book, you better lower your expectations by quite a lot.With THAT out of the way, Flowers in the Attic is a shocking story.  It's about four kids that are forced to live inside an attic while their wicked old grandmother with all her many delightful little mental problems does a below average job taking care of them as she keeps them trapped and unable to leave the house.The interesting thing about the story is that later on, the kids find a way to free themselves from the room, and the grandmother doesn't seem to care a whole lot about that.  But oh BOY- don't have a brother and sister sleeping together in the same bed or all heck will break loose!The butler is another character in the film.  He tries to be scary by never saying a word and walking around with a mean face, but he's just as much of a coward as the grandmother.  He's just as heartless too.There's a spoiler near the end involving one of the kids that shocked me a little.  It's shocking because of the mothers reaction to it.The GREAT storyline twist gradually starts revealing itself near the end involving the mother.  I didn't see THAT coming.  I'll leave it at that.Great suspense, interesting storyline, magnificent acting by all four of the children, and just a great little movie.

348817,A33E41FMNUOQVX,6302970040,"Bill M. ""bill_m1""","[6, 6]","Adapting a book to film isn't as simple as using the book as the movie script.  Some ideas simply don't translate well to the big screen, especially if you have less than 2 hours to develop all of your characters, tell the story, and reach a resolution.  So film makers inevitably have to cut corners and modify the story to make a movie that can be understood and enjoyed by people who haven't even read the book.  That's what they did here.  And as a movie in and of itself, I thought they did a good job.The book ""Flowers in the Attic"" isn't just a horror story of 4 kids locked away in an attic by their zealot grandmother.  It weaves a complex tale about mixed relationship roles in a family, as the lines blur between father/brother, mother/sister, spouse/sibling, and parent/grandparent.  It's also the first book in a series, and the ending doesn't offer much of a resolution.  The bottom line is that there is simply no way you can cram that whole book into a 90 minute movie.  The character development would have been extremely rushed and confusing, and the film might have even gotten an NC-17 rating at the time with the incest.  The writers obviously knew this, though I guess the 1-star reviewers here don't.  I suppose they could have alternatively tried adopting it into a mini-series, but I don't know if they would have been able to keep new viewers tuning in week after week.So the writers instead cut out the incestuous complexities of the brother/sister relationship, and added a resolution which the book doesn't have.  Does this sacrifice a lot of the parallel stories in the book?  Sure.  But again, I don't know how else you could have turned this into a 90 minute movie.  All things considered, they did a decent job.  I have no shame in saying I even liked the movie's ending more than the book's passive ending.",3,As an attempt to cram this book into a 90 minute movie: not bad,1285632000,"09 28, 2010",2010,1840,"['Adapting', 'book', 'film', ""n't"", 'as', 'simple', 'using', 'book', 'movie', 'script', 'ideas', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'translate', 'well', 'big', 'screen', 'especially', 'have', 'less', '2', 'hours', 'develop', 'characters', 'tell', 'story', 'reach', 'resolution', 'So', 'film', 'makers', 'inevitably', 'have', 'cut', 'corners', 'modify', 'story', 'make', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'understood', 'enjoyed', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'read', 'book', 'what', 'did', 'here', 'movie', 'thought', 'did', 'good', 'job.The', 'book', 'Flowers', 'Attic', ""n't"", 'just', 'horror', 'story', '4', 'kids', 'locked', 'away', 'attic', 'zealot', 'grandmother', 'complex', 'tale', 'mixed', 'relationship', 'roles', 'family', 'lines', 'blur', 'father/brother', 'mother/sister', 'spouse/sibling', 'parent/grandparent', 'also', 'first', 'book', 'series', 'ending', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'resolution', 'bottom', 'line', 'simply', 'way', 'can', 'cram', 'whole', 'book', '90', 'minute', 'movie', 'character', 'development', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'extremely', 'rushed', 'confusing', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'even', 'gotten', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'time', 'incest', 'writers', 'obviously', 'knew', 'guess', '1-star', 'reviewers', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'suppose', 'could', 'have', 'alternatively', 'tried', 'adopting', 'mini-series', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'keep', 'new', 'viewers', 'tuning', 'week', 'week.So', 'writers', 'instead', 'cut', 'out', 'incestuous', 'complexities', 'brother/sister', 'relationship', 'added', 'resolution', 'book', ""n't"", 'have', 'Does', 'sacrifice', 'lot', 'parallel', 'stories', 'book', 'Sure', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'turned', '90', 'minute', 'movie', 'things', 'considered', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'have', 'shame', 'saying', 'even', 'liked', 'movie', 'ending', 'more', 'book', 'passive', 'ending']",Flowers in the Attic VHS

Being a guy, that's pretty good considering this series was marketed to teenage girls. Every girl in my Junior High School was reading this book and it's sequals. So, I picked up the book out of idle curiosity and was entralled from the very beginning. The story just pulled me in and I couldn't put it down. In fact here it is 2005 and I'm reading it again for the first time in almost 10 years. It still holds up.Now the movie...well it's just bad from the get go. I was so excited when this movie came out. I was in the theatre on the opening night and 90 minutes later I was swearing up a storm. My favorite book had been butchered. Beyond butchered. It had been totally murdered. Now, I can accept that in order to bring this to the screen that certain things had to be changed. The fact that V.C. Andrews was involved in writing the screenplay before she died gave me some hope that the movie would retain at least the best parts of the book. How wrong I was. The movie starts out almost like the book, but certain events are moved up. For instance, the age of the kids when their father dies is off by at least three years. Fine, that was ok. I could deal with it. However, when the mother and the kids walk up to Foxworth Hall and John Amos Jackson (the butler) answers the door to let them in, I knew that the story was going to go off into left field somewhere and never get back on the right track. I was right. After a few scenes that were somewhat faithful adaptations from the book, the story just shoots off into left field. I don't know what story they were trying to tell, but it certainly was NOT Flowers In The Attic. The only saving grace of this film was that there was no way for them to do a sequal. That is the only nice thing I can say about it.Do yourself a favor and read the book. It is 100% better than this travesty. The worst movie adaptation of a novel that I've ever seen. If I never see the film again it will be just fine with me.

348823,A3IBYRSA490ZOA,6302970040,C. Chow,"[2, 5]","`Flowers in the Attic' truly rates right up there with `The Beguiled' and `Lipstick' as one of the most disturbing films ever made. The intriguing thing is I must admit it is very entertaining.The plot: A Stepford family is turned upside down when dad dies leaving the family penniless. They go to stay with grandma and grandpa whom they've never met. The four children are locked in a bedroom for one year, this is where 99% of the film takes place.It seems that grandma and grandpa want to erase the children since they were the result of incest. At first their mother is their savior who promises to free them from the room as soon as she gets grandpa to write her back into his will. But as the months drag on she ignores them and is wrapped up in herself.After about a year of minimal food and water they kids start to look like the undead.Incest is the main focus of the film as the teenage brother and sister sleep in the same bed, bath each other, and leer over each other. Their grandmother played by Louise Fletcher-defends her title as the meanest witch in the history of  Hollywood-accuses the teens of sinful acts. Maybe she shouldn't have locked them together in a bedroom for a year.The teens also comment that incest should result in birth defects, yet they turned out OK.Kristy Swanson also mentions her ""special relationship"" with her father which he ""didn't have with any of the other children"". In one scene as he gives Kristy a snow globe her mother looks on angrily.If all of this was not messed up enough the children resort to vampirism when they run out of food, the younger children drink the teens' blood.`Flowers In The Attic' truly rates as one of the most FUBAR and disturbing films EVER made. But it's the only one on that list that I can recommend as devilishly entertaining.Or maybe it's just the idea of being locked in a bedroom for one year with Kristy Swanson when she was 16 that's entertaining....that was me two months ago before I read VC Andrews' `Flowers In The Attic,' now I feel like a totally different human being. As I said in my review of the book `Flowers In The Attic' is the greatest epic in the history of story telling. Hence adapting it to film is an IMPOSSIBLE task.The primary reason no film could live up to the book is that the story is told through the eyes of 12 year old Catherine. How can film get us to understand what she is feeling? Although the movie is narrated by Kristy Swanson, narration in film often comes across as cheesy.A faithful film adaptation would also be impossible because the movie would have to be a mini series 10 hours long and be rated X due to the teen sex.I must say the film did have a good production quality. The nightmare of Foxworth Hall was pretty much as described in the book. The cast was also well chosen. Louise Fletcher was perfect as the villainous, and the four children were just as I pictured them, good looking to the point of being ridiculous. (I'm reminded of another film `Who Gets The House' where the 4 kids also looked like they were bread in a eugenics lab.)Where the film fails the most is what they could have done better, show Cathy and Chris falling in love. I can't believe this was TOTALLY left out of the film so it appears as though Cathy and Chris are merely two horny teenagers in heat. It would be like simply showing Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler as simply Civil War refugees. The romance is the meat of the whole story.We want to see Cathy stare longingly into Chris' ""cerulean blue"" eyes and say, ""You look just like Dad."" And we want to see the two play with each others' hair as two school children in love for the very first time. We do not see them kiss even once or say, ""I love you."" Instead we see Chris leering at Cathy as she bathes and the two in bed together making the viewer wonder, ""What the hell is going on? Was this happening before the attic?""The violence against the children is also toned waaayyy down from the book.One should not confuse the film with the book. It's a horror story with tame horror and a love story with NO love.I envision what a faithful film version of this book would be like. I'd make it a 10 hour version of the video from `The Ring'.And I have been recently surprised by film adaptations. `Sin City' was a story I swore no one could make into a movie. But Frank Miller did the impossible by moving from author to director. His film worked because it was 99% faithful to the original story.In conclusion `Flowers In The Attic' is an entertaining film I would still give 5 stars, but it is NOTHING like the book. If they had aimed for a more faithful adaptation it could have been 10 stars.",5,Good Film But Untrue To The Epic Book,1138320000,"01 27, 2006",2006,4663,"['Flowers', 'Attic', 'truly', 'rates', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'Beguiled', 'Lipstick', 'one', 'most', 'disturbing', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'intriguing', 'thing', 'must', 'admit', 'very', 'entertaining.The', 'plot', 'Stepford', 'family', 'turned', 'upside', 'when', 'dad', 'dies', 'leaving', 'family', 'penniless', 'go', 'stay', 'grandma', 'grandpa', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'never', 'met', 'four', 'children', 'are', 'locked', 'bedroom', 'one', 'year', 'where', '99', '%', 'film', 'place.It', 'grandma', 'grandpa', 'want', 'erase', 'children', 'were', 'result', 'incest', 'first', 'mother', 'savior', 'who', 'free', 'room', 'as', 'soon', 'grandpa', 'write', 'back', 'will', 'months', 'drag', 'wrapped', 'up', 'herself.After', 'year', 'minimal', 'food', 'water', 'kids', 'start', 'look', 'undead.Incest', 'main', 'focus', 'film', 'teenage', 'brother', 'sister', 'sleep', 'same', 'bed', 'other', 'leer', 'other', 'grandmother', 'played', 'Louise', 'Fletcher-defends', 'title', 'meanest', 'witch', 'history', 'Hollywood-accuses', 'teens', 'sinful', 'acts', 'Maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'locked', 'together', 'bedroom', 'year.The', 'teens', 'also', 'comment', 'incest', 'should', 'result', 'birth', 'defects', 'yet', 'turned', 'out', 'OK.Kristy', 'Swanson', 'also', 'special', 'relationship', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'children', 'one', 'scene', 'Kristy', 'snow', 'globe', 'mother', 'was', 'not', 'messed', 'up', 'enough', 'children', 'resort', 'vampirism', 'when', 'run', 'food', 'younger', 'children', 'drink', 'teens', 'blood.', 'Flowers', 'Attic', 'truly', 'rates', 'one', 'most', 'FUBAR', 'disturbing', 'films', 'EVER', 'made', 'only', 'one', 'list', 'can', 'recommend', 'devilishly', 'entertaining.Or', 'maybe', 'just', 'idea', 'being', 'locked', 'bedroom', 'one', 'year', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'when', 'was', '16', 'entertaining', 'was', 'two', 'months', 'read', 'VC', 'Andrews', 'Flowers', 'Attic', 'now', 'feel', 'totally', 'different', 'human', 'being', 'said', 'review', 'book', 'Flowers', 'Attic', 'greatest', 'epic', 'history', 'story', 'telling', 'Hence', 'adapting', 'film', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'task.The', 'primary', 'reason', 'film', 'could', 'live', 'up', 'book', 'story', 'told', 'eyes', '12', 'year', 'old', 'Catherine', 'How', 'can', 'film', 'get', 'understand', 'what', 'feeling', 'movie', 'narrated', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'narration', 'film', 'often', 'across', 'cheesy.A', 'faithful', 'film', 'adaptation', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'impossible', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'mini', 'series', '10', 'hours', 'long', 'be', 'rated', 'X', 'due', 'teen', 'sex.I', 'must', 'say', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'good', 'production', 'quality', 'nightmare', 'Foxworth', 'Hall', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'described', 'book', 'cast', 'was', 'also', 'well', 'chosen', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'was', 'perfect', 'villainous', 'four', 'children', 'were', 'just', 'pictured', 'good', 'looking', 'point', 'being', 'ridiculous', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'film', 'Who', 'House', 'where', '4', 'kids', 'also', 'looked', 'were', 'bread', 'eugenics', 'lab', 'Where', 'film', 'most', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'show', 'Cathy', 'Chris', 'falling', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'TOTALLY', 'left', 'film', 'Cathy', 'Chris', 'are', 'merely', 'two', 'horny', 'teenagers', 'heat', 'would', 'be', 'simply', 'showing', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara"", 'Rhett', 'Butler', 'simply', 'Civil', 'War', 'refugees', 'romance', 'meat', 'whole', 'story.We', 'want', 'see', 'Cathy', 'stare', 'longingly', 'Chris', 'cerulean', 'blue', 'eyes', 'say', 'look', 'just', 'Dad', 'want', 'see', 'two', 'play', 'others', 'hair', 'two', 'school', 'children', 'love', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'kiss', 'even', 'once', 'say', 'love', 'Instead', 'see', 'Chris', 'leering', 'Cathy', 'two', 'bed', 'together', 'making', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'What', 'hell', 'going', 'Was', 'happening', 'attic', 'violence', 'children', 'also', 'toned', 'waaayyy', 'down', 'book.One', 'should', 'not', 'confuse', 'film', 'book', 'horror', 'story', 'tame', 'horror', 'love', 'story', 'NO', 'love.I', 'envision', 'what', 'faithful', 'film', 'version', 'book', 'would', 'be', ""'d"", 'make', '10', 'hour', 'version', 'video', ""Ring'.And"", 'have', 'been', 'recently', 'surprised', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Sin', 'City', 'was', 'story', 'swore', 'one', 'could', 'make', 'movie', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'did', 'impossible', 'moving', 'author', 'director', 'film', 'worked', 'was', '99', '%', 'faithful', 'original', 'story.In', 'conclusion', 'Flowers', 'Attic', 'entertaining', 'film', 'would', 'still', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'NOTHING', 'book', 'had', 'aimed', 'more', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'could', 'have', 'been', '10', 'stars']",Flowers in the Attic VHS

The novels were very successful, and it didn't come as a surprise that a movie version was released in 1987.  But what was the point of making the film if it would not follow the main themes found in the book?I won't go into detail about the plot.  If you've read the book, then you know what it's about.  This film was meant to be a standalone (the other four books would not be made into films), and some changes had to be made.  Cathy (Kristin Swanson) and Chris (Jeb Stuart Adams) are a few years older in the film, as are the two younger kids.  The ebb and flow had to be different and the ending had to be changed so that there would be no cliffhangers.  All of that was understandable.  But what about the nature vs. nurture theme?  The grandmother (Louise Fletcher) is a religious fanatic, hates her daughter Corrine (Victoria Tennant) for marrying her half-uncle, and sees her daughter's offspring as ""devil's issue.""  It is an irony that Cathy and Chris end up doing the very things their grandmother abhors because they get locked up together in a room with an attic, with no one but each other, playing mom and dad to their younger siblings for three years.  Yet none of this happens in the film.  Well, you get the vanilla version of it.  This is a run-of-the-mill gothic story with some bad acting combined with some very cheesy dialogue.  The worst acting goes to Tennant.  The woman had a blank expression throughout the film.  I've seen mannequins who show more emotion than she does.  The only great part about this film is V.C. Andrew's one-second long cameo appearance as a window-cleaning maid.  This film is simply awful.

Mom, Dad, and four precious children (all with names starting with ""C"") are the picture of perfection, until on dad's birthday he does not come home. Dad has died, and now the family is in shambles. After selling everything they own, mom decides to take the kids to her parent's mansion. Relatives they have never met and a creepy isolated mansion with even creepier help, make for a very uncomfortable homecoming. The kids find out that in order to for their mother to win back her father's affection (and fortune) they cannot exist in the house, so they are locked away in the attic. A stern grandmother makes them even more uneasy ... apparently some family secrets make it impossible for her to love her own grandchildren. Things go from bad to worse as mother's visits become more infrequent and grandmother stops feeding them. The kids want to love their mother, but also realize the insanity of the situation. How will they escape, and what will become of their little family?I thought this was an average film. A creepy gothic film is executed well with this plot.

I was looking for something to pass time with and I thought this would be a nice entertainment for the evening. I have to admit that I thought the beginning was dull and *too* perfect. A family of attractive young blonde members with a nice home and a cozy lifestyle what can be better? Such perfection bores me. However, things started picking up after the oh not so tragic and sudden father's death due to what again? I can't remember, I just recall the scene in which the news is being broken to the wife by the police officer while she's preparing that surprise party for him is incredibly cheesy. I'm not saying things got better after that, they actually became gradually worse but at least they weren't as annoying they were just bad.Whatever her name is the mother of four young children all blonde, good looking and she's too young to be the mother of two teenagers and two young twins. Anyways, their mother loses everything after the death of their father so she runs back into her parents house whom we are told are very rich in order to support her family because she's too lazy and princess like to take a job and support herself, plus there's no way little miss billionaire can live a tight life of little to no spending God forbid! The only problem is her parents hate her for running away and marrying the father of her children and so they made no contact whatsoever ever since before her children were even born. Now, she needs to win her father's approval back in order for him to sign the inheritance to her, making her his only heir and filthy rich. After much whining and abuse from her mother who suggests locking the kids in the attic away from everyone else, and feeding them at certain times a day like prisoners. The father finally forgives their mother but only if she had no kids from her dead husband and what do you know? She decided to tell him she had none, goes around partying all week, forgets about her kids and leaves them to her cold heartless mother. The kids get trapped in the attic for a whole two years and their mom never keeps her promise by letting them out even after her father's death. Instead she remarries, poisons her children with sweets which leads to one of the twins dying and completely abandons them while they're still locked in that attic. Appears to be the two older kids who experience puberty while being locked together also develop feelings for each other and sooner than later commit insect :S I didn't know what was up with that but I guess the writer of the story was trying to make a point by saying never lock your kids in together for a very long time or else... How else would you explain that sickly twist?Overall, the story made little to no sense. The kids were locked in because their mother wanted them to even after her father died she still continued to make sure they never went anywhere. I don't understand why. We never get a valid explanation for why their mother behaved the way she did towards her kids. Is it because she felt she's not capable of raising them after her husband died? Or is it because she was truly evil? Everyone in this movie and I mean all the adults involved except their dead father is evil. The kids were getting child abuse over the entire course of the film and we the audience never understood why.I wish the plot and the motives were a little bit clearer, Also the characters I found were very silly and cartoonish. The acting was average at best. Thank God the movie has ended quickly and didn't drag on that renders the 1 star I gave, the second is I found the settings pretty.

I envisioned them to be almost doll like and beautiful and especially the mother. Usually when a woman is very beautiful she passes on her beautiful traits to her children. The first time I saw this movie was at the age 13. I sat there about as riveted as a 13 year old can be. And when it went off, I thought to myself ""that was a pretty good movie"". And I took that thinking with me, all through these years...until today, when I saw it for the second time. This time I watched the movie through an adult eye, and thought to myself, ""Wow, this movie is really bad""This is a classic Bad Movie element especially when the film is a book adaptation. It generally means that the filmmakers are afraid that they'll be unable to cram enough of the book's contents into the movie. For those who don't know, the story is about four beautiful children (Chris (Jeb Stuart Adams), Cathy (Kristy Swanson), Carrie (Lindsey Parker), and Cory (Ben Ryan Ganger), who are locked away in a room by their selfish mother (Victoria Tennant), with a filthy attic as their playground. Their cruel heartless Grandmother (Louise Fletcher) brainwashes the small children, Cory and Carrie, into thinking that they are ""devil's spawn"", and they are painfully malnourished. They live each day as if it were a year, sadly awaiting the truths that are to come from their greedy mother. The narration is used to jam as much expository dialog and back-story down our craw as we can stomach. The narrator is an older version of Cathy, the main character, looking back at the film's events. The movie was nothing compared to the book. Maybe a few scenes here and there to tell you that you are watching the movie version of ""flowers in the attic"", but nothing major. It did not keep me on the edge of my seat at all. I also read a book called ""Garden of Shadows"" which leads up to the story of ""Flowers in the attic"".Come to fine out the studio snuck out the actually rating quietly. First, the story had to be changed to PG-13 rating so there's no incest at all--not even suggested. The tortures their grandmother puts them through were softened or eliminated entirely. They aren't up there for three years. And they completely changed the ending (although it WAS great to see the mother get it at the end). All the changes drained the story of any impact it might have had. Acting didn't help--Louise Fletcher is a great actress but her role was rather wooden and farce; Victoria Tennant was even worse as the mother; Kristy Swanson overplayed her role a LOT. Only Jeb Stuart Adams gave a halfway good performance. It was no great piece of acting but okay.I would really love it if some really great director came out with the movie version of ""Garden of Shadows"" and as the follow up with a remake of ""Flowers in the Attic"". And if the movie is recreated I would really like to see that the characters look as if they are described in the book and also they should at least be real blondes and try not to leave out the most explosive scenes. People love drama and to leave out the most dramatic parts of the book makes no sense. Chris and Cathy's romance is essential as a theme of the book because it parallels the 'evil breeds evil' theme that the grandmother believes in and what the children come to realize later: what *true* evil is.  To be fair to the movie, a faithful adaptation of the book would probably be way too grim for a movie (and get an NC-17 rating) but diluting it completely AND adding lousy acting isn't the way to go!",2,Good Golly Ms. Molly this one of the WORST interpretations of a GREAT novel!,1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,3615,"['read', 'Flowers', 'attic', 'pre-teens', 'was', 'captured', 'story', 'characters', 'envisioned', 'be', 'almost', 'doll', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'mother', 'Usually', 'when', 'woman', 'very', 'beautiful', 'beautiful', 'traits', 'children', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'age', '13', 'sat', 'there', 'about', 'as', 'riveted', '13', 'year', 'old', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'went', 'thought', 'myself', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'took', 'thinking', 'years', 'today', 'when', 'saw', 'second', 'time', 'time', 'watched', 'movie', 'adult', 'eye', 'thought', 'myself', 'Wow', 'movie', 'really', 'bad', 'classic', 'Bad', 'Movie', 'element', 'especially', 'when', 'film', 'book', 'adaptation', 'generally', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'afraid', ""'ll"", 'be', 'unable', 'cram', 'enough', 'book', 'contents', 'movie', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'four', 'beautiful', 'children', 'Chris', 'Jeb', 'Stuart', 'Adams', 'Cathy', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'Carrie', 'Lindsey', 'Parker', 'Cory', 'Ben', 'Ryan', 'Ganger', 'who', 'are', 'locked', 'away', 'room', 'selfish', 'mother', 'Victoria', 'Tennant', 'filthy', 'attic', 'playground', 'cruel', 'heartless', 'Grandmother', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'small', 'children', 'Cory', 'Carrie', 'thinking', 'are', 'devil', 'spawn', 'are', 'painfully', 'malnourished', 'live', 'day', 'were', 'year', 'sadly', 'awaiting', 'truths', 'are', 'come', 'greedy', 'mother', 'narration', 'used', 'jam', 'as', 'much', 'expository', 'dialog', 'back-story', 'down', 'craw', 'can', 'stomach', 'narrator', 'older', 'version', 'Cathy', 'main', 'character', 'looking', 'back', 'film', 'events', 'movie', 'was', 'nothing', 'compared', 'book', 'Maybe', 'few', 'scenes', 'here', 'there', 'tell', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'version', 'flowers', 'attic', 'nothing', 'major', 'did', 'not', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'also', 'read', 'book', 'called', 'Garden', 'Shadows', 'story', 'Flowers', 'attic', '.Come', 'fine', 'out', 'studio', 'snuck', 'out', 'actually', 'rating', 'quietly', 'First', 'story', 'had', 'be', 'changed', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'so', 'incest', 'not', 'even', 'suggested', 'tortures', 'grandmother', 'were', 'softened', 'eliminated', 'entirely', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'three', 'years', 'completely', 'changed', 'ending', 'WAS', 'great', 'see', 'mother', 'get', 'end', 'changes', 'drained', 'story', 'impact', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'Acting', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'great', 'actress', 'role', 'was', 'rather', 'wooden', 'farce', 'Victoria', 'Tennant', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'mother', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'overplayed', 'role', 'LOT', 'Only', 'Jeb', 'Stuart', 'Adams', 'gave', 'halfway', 'good', 'performance', 'was', 'great', 'piece', 'acting', 'would', 'really', 'love', 'really', 'great', 'director', 'came', 'out', 'movie', 'version', 'Garden', 'Shadows', 'follow', 'up', 'remake', 'Flowers', 'Attic', 'movie', 'recreated', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'see', 'characters', 'look', 'are', 'described', 'book', 'also', 'should', 'least', 'be', 'real', 'blondes', 'try', 'not', 'leave', 'out', 'most', 'explosive', 'scenes', 'People', 'love', 'drama', 'leave', 'out', 'most', 'dramatic', 'parts', 'book', 'sense', 'Chris', 'Cathy', 'romance', 'essential', 'theme', 'book', ""'evil"", 'breeds', 'evil', 'theme', 'grandmother', 'what', 'children', 'come', 'realize', 'later', 'what', '*true*', 'evil', 'be', 'fair', 'movie', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'book', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'way', 'too', 'grim', 'movie', 'get', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'diluting', 'completely', 'adding', 'lousy', 'acting', ""n't"", 'way', 'go']",Flowers in the Attic VHS

348861,A3SKTPG5M6ND6,6302970040,"Katherine Laura Mayfield ""A Bookie""","[4, 5]","and you'll think this is a better-than-average made-for-TV (even though it wasn't) movie, and you'll appreciate the book even more.Let's start with the cons:  The book was set in the late 1950's (around 1957, I think, and I know I'm comparing to the book, but bear with me), whereas the movie is set in present-day.  This presents many problems.Just an aside:  ""A Walk to Remember"" by Nicholas Sparks was set in 1958 and when it was translated to the screen, it lost a lot of its charm because it was set in the present.  There's just a certain charm about time past that cannot be duplicated in the here and now.Anyway, fast-forwarding the book about thirty years, it lost something.  The children would have been much more innocent, but then again, Jeb Stuart Adams and Kristy Swanson were MUCH too old for the roles.  I know they were supposed to be older going into the attic than they were in the book (I am guessing Chris and Cathy are the same age going into the attic in the movie as they were coming out in the book), but Jeb Adams was twenty-seven, and he looked it.  And am I the only one who noticed the children more resembled displaced Amish children (Chris wears suspenders and what was with Cathy and those dowdy dresses?) than the Dresden dolls they were supposed to be?These children did not look Aryan enough--yes, they had blond(e) hair, though I didn't notice any blue eyes, and Cory's curly hair made him look Jewish (which would have been fine, if this was a story about Jewish children, but it wasn't), neither were any of these children stunning; they were all rather ordinary looking (Kristy Swanson was somewhat pretty, at least before her hair got chopped off).  Though Victoria Tennant is elegant and attractive (but not as) in a Grace Kelly sort of way, she looked a bit tired.  As for the father, well, I imagined a much handsomer man (think Jeffrey Hunter with blond hair), but oh, well.But it was the children's ages that were worse.  The twins were fine, but Chris and Cathy were post-pubescent in the movie, as opposed to pre-pubescent in the book (though Chris is fourteen in the book, he doesn't start growing hair in certain places until later), which explains why the children in the book held out for as long as they did before escaping.  It is much easier to control a fourteen-year-old boy than a boy old enough to serve in the military.I think the worst scene of the film was when Chris and Cathy are on the bus in the daytime and Cathy is going on about how they never had a pet, about how they should have had one so they could get used to death, or some such nonsense as that, so that she would know that fathers die, even handsome, wonderful ones, too.  It was so totally pointless.I also think the fact that they arrived at Foxworth Hall during the daytime and through the front door instead of in the dark of night through the back deflated some of the mystery.  The cinematography could have been darker in some places, lighter in others.  Instead, it always seemed like it had just rained.We are given just a glimpse of what life was like, how sunny yellow it was, before Chris Sr.'s death.I didn't really mind the ending with Corinne dying, being hung by her wedding veil, because I really do see a book and a movie made from it as two separate works of art.  That's how Margaret Mitchell felt about ""Gone with the Wind"".  Though I read somewhere a sequel was planned, I am not sure how they would have went about doing that as ""Petals on the Wind"" focused not only on Cathy's exciting and versatile love life, but on getting revenge on her mother.Cathy's character was just totally different in the movie (and so was Carrie's--Carrie was a little spitfire in the book) and in leaving out the incest between Chris and Cathy, it lost something.  Chris was just blah and Cory was cute and all, but not much else.  The female characters dominated this film.Overall, the movie was just a low-budget, lackluster production.Now for the pros:  The haunting, chilling score (I'm still not sure how I feel about Cathy's narrating), and Louise Fletcher was perfect as the grandmother.  This flick is entertaining enough because when I watched it before I even knew of the book's existence, I was intrigued.  I've watched it twice since then and have the same opinion I've had since reading the book--that it could have been so much better, but better had it not been done at all.

Excellent story line, and in the beginning, how their father died and they had to resort to living back home, where she escaped from years ago.Now, because of the mom's incestuous relationship with the children's father, how the grandmother  was going to punish them all for the mothers sins,including the mom. very sick. very interesting.At the end, I would have liked to see more reaction from the mother's wedding party when the children finally escape from the attic and tell everyone during the ceremony of the mom's marriage, how they were locked in the attic all that time and how the younger son was poisoned by his own mother, AND NOW HERE SHE IS GETTING MARRIED TO A MAN WHO HAD NO IDEA SHE EVEN HAD CHILDREN.

Infact, the ending of this movie also changes Petals on the Wind)We all know that movies are never exactly like the book, but so many vital elements were left out and ignored. In the movie, we do not see the grandfather at all, and all of the f*ed-upness in the book is never truly shown in the movie. By the f*ed-upness I mean Olivia forcing Corrine to show the whip marks to her children, the constant lectures on how they're devil's spawn, the older two catching a glimpse of their grandfather, etc. All the subtle elements in the book that explain the story to its fullest are not even touched upon by the movie, so if you never read the book, this movie will feel confusing for you.

They were designed to get us interested in reading, but looking back this was the scariest, let alone the cheapest, marketing tactic in history.A family full of adorable, sweet tempered, cherubs is uprooted from their former happy life to live with their horrible Grandmother in a country estate following the death of their father in a car accident.  As they are broke and have no where else to go, the four children and their mother go to live with their reletives who they have had little to no contact with all their lives.  Grandma locks them in the attic and explains on no uncertain terms that they are to live there and not to get love from her, as they are the products of sin.  As it turns out their father and mother were actually uncle and neice, and all four children were the product of incest.  *YUCK!*  Naturally the Grandmother turns her nose up at these kids, but doesn't let her maternal instincts take over to forgive them for their parents' sins.  They are kept as prisoners in the home, their mother is mysteriously absent.  As it turns out, their mother is working at rebuilding her life and marrying well, hoping to eventually forget the four children and start afresh.  All the while the four kids are starving (one eventually dies), and plotting an escape from their prison.Curiously enough, the movie version seems to skirt the implied incest that occurs between the oldest brother and sister.  Those who had never read the book might eventually pick up on it with some subtle hints (plus the fact that the Grandmother refuses to let them sleep in the same bed together).  I wonder why, as there would hardly have been a story without the presence of incest.Sex always catches our attention, but incest?  Yikes!  This was before trash TV when incest was a dirty secret.  This movie was bad, but let's face facts, people, the book (let alone all those following to this day) was a trashy story then and is a trashy story now.

348879,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6302970040,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 9]","Flowers in the Attic (Jeffrey Bloom, 1987)I wish I could say that Flowers in the Attic is the worst movie I've seen this year. Unfortunately, it is not, for I have been embroiled in a two-week crapfest the likes of which I would not wish on my worst enemy. With that frame of reference, when I say Flowers in the Attic is more of the same, hopefully you will understand.The story, which was beloved of grammar school and junior high girls everywhere when I was a kid (it was THE cool book to have read when I was in fifth grade in 1979), but which may have faded into obscurity: there is a family. The father (Jagged Edge's Marhsall Colt) dies. Mother (La Peste's Victoria Tennant) takes the four kids-- Chris (Jeb Stuart Adams of The Goonies), Cathy (Kristy Swanson, the only Buffy the Vampire Slayer who really mattered), Cory (Ben Ryan Granger, who recently, before his seeming retirement, popped up in Ed Wood), and Carrie (Lindsay Parker, who enjoyed a few years of child stardom before scaling back to occasional guest performances)-- and heads off to the family homestead, run by the dying Grandfather (Nathan Davis, recently of Holes) and Grandmother (Louise Fletcher, most recently of The Last Sin Eater). However, Grandma tells the kids in no uncertain terms they're evil little beasties, since it seems mom and dad were related; Grandpa is not to know they exist, so Mom and Grandma keep them locked up in the northern wing of the mansion, where they develop their own little world-- except not everyone is content to leave them alone in it...The original posters for the movie declared it had been written and directed by Wes Craven (facsimiles of them are included with the DVD); it should take the average viewer about two minutes to realize this isn't the case. Subsequently, Jeffrey Bloom took responsibility for this travesty, and (perhaps not coincidentally) did not work again in Hollywood, aside from an extremely short-lived TV show he produced and directed, for eighteen years. Yes, this movie is that bad. The novel is, of course, a genre potboiler, practically made for the purpose of being filmed, and yet the script (also written by Bloom) still manages to leave out large sections, both in the (seeming) interest of ""cleaning up"" the novel to get a more family-friendly rating and in order to streamline things, we assume. Unfortunately, the streamlining, as much streamlining does, gets rid of the vast majority of the stuff that gives the book any emotional impact whatsoever.The acting is bloody well atrocious. I'm half-amazed any of the principals ever worked in Hollywood again, and completely amazed Kristy Swanson was actually nominated for an award for this (more so that she won!). I've seen less melodramatic soap operas.There's really nothing else to be said-- if you never read the books, read them instead. If you did, don't see this, for you will end up hating everyone involved with a passion you didn't know you had. Absolutely awful. (half)",1,DO! NOT!

348883,A2U4CL1XR2EKPV,6302970040,Sarah,"[38, 43]","First off, I have to say that the movie barely even follows the same plot as the brilliant book. The were so many problems! In the book the oldest girl was supposed to be 12 when they came to the attic, in the movie she looks 15 or 16. In the book the grandmother didn't cut the oldest girls hair, she tried but Chris stopped her. And what happened to the incest? It carried such huge messages and themes in the book and in the movie there is none of it. I could go on for pages about the inconsistensies, even the ending is hugely different. I swear sometimes when they actually said something from the book I would think &quot;Hey! That's kinda like Flowers In The-...oh yeah...&quot;. But to defend the makers of this movie a bit, this was before the entertainment industry relized how much it annoys people when they don't follow much loved books. I mean look at the 2 latest movies based on books, Lord Of The Rings and Harry Potter. They are two great books with movies that are good as well and stay true to them. I really wish they would remake the movie and have a movie for each book in the series. I think Flowers In The Attic was around 400 pages. When a 400 page book is squashed into an 85 minute movie it isn't pretty...But for a moment here lets forget about the book, now lets look at the problems with the stand alone movie. The acting was quite weak at times. Cory's voice was annoying but I actually respected that because it seemed more realistic. Another thing I like about the movie was how it showed that man digging the four graves, that was a very eerie well done scene. A shame it was only 4 seconds and the rest of the movie never had that eerie mood. A movie like this really should have that eerie mood. It all happened too fast. And you never got to know the characters well enough to feel bad for them. You never got to know the mother well enough to be shocked when the truth came out. Nothing was understood, there seemed to be a shortage of lines. And half the lines were chocked full of emotion that came to soon and too rushed. Instead of getting the feeling they were in the attic for years, you feel they were in the attic for 85 minutes, the time of the movie. It doesn't glide you from scene to scene, it puts more circles under the childrens eyes and tell you it's been a few months. And by skipping those few months we lose a lot of important dialoge and emotions that must have passed between the children. All in all you should really only watch this out of curiosity, not for entertainment, and not for a substitute of the book.",2,Too mixed and jumbled...,1010016000,"01 3, 2002",2002,2574,"['First', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'barely', 'even', 'same', 'plot', 'brilliant', 'book', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'problems', 'book', 'oldest', 'girl', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', '12', 'when', 'came', 'attic', 'movie', '15', '16', 'book', 'grandmother', 'did', ""n't"", 'cut', 'oldest', 'girls', 'hair', 'tried', 'Chris', 'stopped', 'what', 'happened', 'incest', 'carried', 'such', 'huge', 'messages', 'themes', 'book', 'movie', 'none', 'could', 'go', 'pages', 'inconsistensies', 'even', 'ending', 'hugely', 'different', 'swear', 'sometimes', 'when', 'actually', 'said', 'something', 'book', 'would', 'think', 'quot', 'Hey', 'kinda', 'Flowers', 'The-', 'yeah', 'quot', 'defend', 'makers', 'movie', 'bit', 'was', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'relized', 'how', 'much', 'people', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'much', 'loved', 'books', 'mean', 'look', '2', 'latest', 'movies', 'based', 'books', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'are', 'two', 'great', 'books', 'movies', 'are', 'good', 'well', 'stay', 'true', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'remake', 'movie', 'have', 'movie', 'book', 'series', 'think', 'Flowers', 'Attic', 'was', '400', 'pages', 'When', '400', 'page', 'book', 'squashed', '85', 'minute', 'movie', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'moment', 'here', 'forget', 'book', 'now', 'look', 'problems', 'stand', 'alone', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'weak', 'times', 'Cory', 'voice', 'was', 'annoying', 'actually', 'respected', 'seemed', 'more', 'realistic', 'thing', 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'how', 'showed', 'man', 'digging', 'four', 'graves', 'was', 'very', 'eerie', 'well', 'done', 'scene', 'shame', 'was', 'only', '4', 'seconds', 'rest', 'movie', 'never', 'had', 'eerie', 'mood', 'movie', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'eerie', 'mood', 'happened', 'too', 'fast', 'never', 'got', 'know', 'characters', 'well', 'enough', 'feel', 'bad', 'never', 'got', 'know', 'mother', 'well', 'enough', 'be', 'shocked', 'when', 'truth', 'came', 'out', 'Nothing', 'was', 'understood', 'seemed', 'be', 'shortage', 'lines', 'lines', 'were', 'chocked', 'full', 'emotion', 'came', 'soon', 'too', 'rushed', 'Instead', 'getting', 'feeling', 'were', 'attic', 'years', 'feel', 'were', 'attic', '85', 'minutes', 'time', 'movie', ""n't"", 'glide', 'scene', 'scene', 'more', 'circles', 'childrens', 'eyes', 'tell', 'been', 'few', 'months', 'skipping', 'few', 'months', 'lose', 'lot', 'important', 'dialoge', 'emotions', 'must', 'have', 'passed', 'children', 'should', 'really', 'only', 'watch', 'curiosity', 'not', 'entertainment', 'not', 'substitute', 'book']",Flowers in the Attic VHS

348887,A1XEFHQZP8Y35W,6302970040,Silver Screen,"[9, 12]","V. C. Andrews was one of my favorite authors when I was in high school - - and the ""Flowers in the Attic"" series was my absolute favorite.Perhaps the ""Flowers"" story would have been better justified by a miniseries, or even an HBO series nowadays where they could deal with the adult material.  But back in the late '80s, this was what Hollywood offered us.It's not that the movie is horrible, it's just not the book.  If that's what you're expecting, you will be disappointed.The overall structure is pretty much the same as the book.  The Dollangangers live their perfect lives until the father dies in a car accident and the mother has no choice but to return home to her disapproving parents - - particularly the bitter, religiously zealous Grandmother.  Apparently the grandparents own a huge estate (Foxworth Hall)and much money and the children's mother is their sole heir.  The Grandmother has concoted a scheme to keep the children's existence from their grandfather, who is dying and who believes his daughter to be childless.  The children will live in an upstairs attic until their grandfather dies, at which time they will be released and able to live a life of luxury, as the Foxworth heirs.Readers of the book will know that those plans go horribly awry - - and that Chris and Cathy, the two oldest children, forced to grow up together, fall in love with each other.The movie touches on this very little - - probably because the filmmakers believed that moviegoers might not appreciate the incestous love between a brother and sister.  And while that might be true, it robs the ""Flowers"" story of its very backbone.Another fault within the movie is that the movie itself doesn't show you how very long the children were locked up in the attic.  In the book, the children were locked up for over three years.  In the movie version, it feels as though the children were there for maybe a week. Other than the children looking somewhat haggard and pale, they don't appear to age and therefore, the viewer isn't truly horrified at the length of their incarceration.The ending of the movie too, is completely different from the literary ""Flowers"".  While the first book spawned a handful of sequels, the movie obviously had to wrap things up.  So the film ending is very, VERY different from the book's ending.  Again, maybe a miniseries would have been better - - there would have been more time to develop the stories, to make the viewer really feel as though those children were locked up for an eternity -- and even to continue the story.The acting is capable - -nothing standout either good or bad, in my opinion.  As one other reviewer mentioned, the kids' ages were a little off from the book but that's relatively minor stuff.  Louise Fletcher is as ferocious as the Grandmother as she is in some of her other roles and Victoria Tennant is chillingly convincing as the materialistic mother.If you have read the ""Flowers"" series of books, you'd probably better skip this movie.  If not, pop the movie in and if you're entertained, you might want to start reading the series.",2,Don't Expect the Book,1142812800,"03 20, 2006",2006,3091,"['V.', 'C.', 'Andrews', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'authors', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'Flowers', 'Attic', 'series', 'was', 'absolute', 'Flowers', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'justified', 'miniseries', 'even', 'HBO', 'series', 'nowadays', 'where', 'could', 'deal', 'adult', 'material', 'back', 'late', ""'80s"", 'was', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'offered', 'us.It', 'not', 'movie', 'horrible', 'just', 'not', 'book', 'what', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed.The', 'overall', 'structure', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'book', 'Dollangangers', 'live', 'perfect', 'lives', 'father', 'car', 'accident', 'mother', 'choice', 'return', 'home', 'disapproving', 'parents', 'particularly', 'bitter', 'religiously', 'zealous', 'Grandmother', 'Apparently', 'grandparents', 'own', 'huge', 'estate', 'Foxworth', 'Hall', 'much', 'money', 'children', 'mother', 'sole', 'heir', 'Grandmother', 'concoted', 'scheme', 'keep', 'children', 'existence', 'grandfather', 'who', 'dying', 'who', 'daughter', 'be', 'childless', 'children', 'will', 'live', 'upstairs', 'attic', 'grandfather', 'dies', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'able', 'live', 'life', 'luxury', 'Foxworth', 'heirs.Readers', 'book', 'will', 'know', 'plans', 'go', 'horribly', 'awry', 'Chris', 'Cathy', 'two', 'oldest', 'children', 'forced', 'grow', 'up', 'together', 'fall', 'love', 'other.The', 'movie', 'touches', 'very', 'little', 'probably', 'filmmakers', 'believed', 'moviegoers', 'might', 'not', 'appreciate', 'incestous', 'love', 'brother', 'sister', 'might', 'be', 'true', 'Flowers', 'story', 'very', 'backbone.Another', 'fault', 'movie', 'movie', ""n't"", 'show', 'how', 'very', 'long', 'children', 'were', 'locked', 'up', 'attic', 'book', 'children', 'were', 'locked', 'up', 'three', 'years', 'movie', 'version', 'children', 'were', 'there', 'maybe', 'week', 'Other', 'children', 'looking', 'somewhat', 'haggard', 'pale', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'age', 'therefore', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'truly', 'horrified', 'length', 'incarceration.The', 'ending', 'movie', 'too', 'completely', 'different', 'literary', 'Flowers', 'first', 'book', 'spawned', 'handful', 'sequels', 'movie', 'obviously', 'had', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'film', 'ending', 'very', 'VERY', 'different', 'book', 'ending', 'Again', 'maybe', 'miniseries', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'time', 'develop', 'stories', 'make', 'viewer', 'really', 'feel', 'children', 'were', 'locked', 'up', 'eternity', 'even', 'continue', 'story.The', 'acting', 'capable', '-nothing', 'either', 'good', 'bad', 'opinion', 'one', 'other', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'kids', 'ages', 'were', 'little', 'off', 'book', 'relatively', 'minor', 'stuff', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'as', 'ferocious', 'Grandmother', 'other', 'roles', 'Victoria', 'Tennant', 'chillingly', 'convincing', 'materialistic', 'mother.If', 'have', 'read', 'Flowers', 'series', 'books', ""'d"", 'probably', 'better', 'skip', 'movie', 'not', 'pop', 'movie', ""'re"", 'entertained', 'might', 'want', 'start', 'reading', 'series']",Flowers in the Attic VHS

348894,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,6302970040,the masked reviewer,"[4, 6]","The scariest thing about Flowers in the Attic, is that the novel by V. C. Andrews has sold billions of copies. For anyone who somehow missed the book, this is a story of four very blond children - a couple of strapping teens named Cathy (Kristy Swanson) and Chris (Jeb Adams), who like to sleep in the same bed and keep the bathroom door open. And then there's the little twinsies, Carrie (Lindsay Parker) and Cory (Ben Ganger). Their mother's name is Corinne (Victoria Tennant). If they have a cat, it is most likely named `Cat'.This cute clan is disrupted by the death of father, whereupon Tennant takes them back to the family manse, from whence she was kicked out 17 years ago, after marrying her own uncle! She plans to regain the love of her dying father and inherit his fortune. (Apparently applying for a job and joining the workforce just never entered into the equation).The kids are locked in a spacious bedroom and treated with extreme cruelty by their grandmother Louise Fletcher, who must have studied Piper Laurie's every move in Brian DePalma's ""Carrie"". (It's a shame she didn't notice the subtleties in that performance as well. Her acting is so over-the-top, if she had a black moustache, she would twirl it.) She calls them ''devil's spawn'' and goes so far as to trim Cathy's blonde locks. (oh no!)The children spend most of their time in the attic - which they get to through a secret door in their room. It is here that their eyes grow cavernous - apparently from too much makeup. But what really gets to the kids is the realization that mother Tennant has been sprinkling arsenic on their cookies. (This makes Tennant a hero in our opinion as these children are so annoying and stupid, poisoning falls into the category of mercy killing.) But enough of this, lest, as little Cory, who eats more cookies than is good for him, puts it, ''We'll have to thwow up.''Incestuous desires run rampant in the original novel, but the movie,written and directed for minimum impact by Jeffrey Bloom, only offers soft-focus innuendo. Stripped of its metaphorical trimmings, the sublimely ridiculous plot reduces the viewer to laughter more than tears.On second thought, the scariest thing about this movie is that the original novel was followed by more horticultural horror sequels, ''Petals on the Wind,'' ''If There Be Thorns'' ''Seeds of Yesterday'' and ''Garden of Shadows.'' to name but a few.Could there still be bitter fruit to come? . . .Now that's the REAL horror!",5,Aryan incestoids escape torture and neglect and discover that keeping it in the family really is the best policy.,1197763200,"12 16, 2007",2007,2484,"['scariest', 'thing', 'Flowers', 'Attic', 'novel', 'V.', 'C.', 'Andrews', 'sold', 'billions', 'copies', 'anyone', 'who', 'somehow', 'missed', 'book', 'story', 'four', 'very', 'blond', 'children', 'couple', 'strapping', 'teens', 'named', 'Cathy', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'Chris', 'Jeb', 'Adams', 'who', 'sleep', 'same', 'bed', 'keep', 'bathroom', 'door', 'open', 'then', 'little', 'twinsies', 'Carrie', 'Lindsay', 'Parker', 'Cory', 'Ben', 'Ganger', 'mother', 'name', 'Corinne', 'Victoria', 'Tennant', 'have', 'cat', 'most', 'likely', 'named', ""Cat'.This"", 'cute', 'clan', 'disrupted', 'death', 'father', 'whereupon', 'Tennant', 'back', 'family', 'manse', 'whence', 'was', 'kicked', 'out', '17', 'years', 'ago', 'marrying', 'own', 'uncle', 'regain', 'love', 'dying', 'father', 'inherit', 'fortune', 'Apparently', 'applying', 'job', 'joining', 'workforce', 'just', 'never', 'entered', 'equation', '.The', 'kids', 'are', 'locked', 'spacious', 'bedroom', 'treated', 'extreme', 'cruelty', 'grandmother', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'studied', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'move', 'Brian', 'DePalma', 'Carrie', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'subtleties', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'had', 'black', 'moustache', 'would', 'twirl', 'devil', 'spawn', 'so', 'far', 'trim', 'Cathy', 'blonde', 'locks', 'oh', 'children', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'attic', 'get', 'secret', 'door', 'room', 'here', 'eyes', 'grow', 'cavernous', 'apparently', 'too', 'much', 'makeup', 'what', 'really', 'kids', 'realization', 'mother', 'Tennant', 'been', 'sprinkling', 'arsenic', 'cookies', 'Tennant', 'hero', 'opinion', 'children', 'are', 'so', 'annoying', 'stupid', 'poisoning', 'falls', 'category', 'mercy', 'killing', 'enough', 'lest', 'little', 'Cory', 'who', 'more', 'cookies', 'good', ""'ll"", 'have', 'thwow', 'up', ""''Incestuous"", 'desires', 'run', 'rampant', 'original', 'novel', 'movie', 'written', 'directed', 'minimum', 'impact', 'Jeffrey', 'Bloom', 'only', 'soft-focus', 'innuendo', 'Stripped', 'metaphorical', 'trimmings', 'sublimely', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'viewer', 'laughter', 'more', 'tears.On', 'second', 'thought', 'scariest', 'thing', 'movie', 'original', 'novel', 'was', 'followed', 'more', 'horticultural', 'horror', 'sequels', 'Petals', 'Wind', 'Be', 'Thorns', 'Seeds', 'Yesterday', 'Garden', 'Shadows', 'name', 'few.Could', 'still', 'be', 'bitter', 'fruit', 'come', 'REAL', 'horror']",Flowers in the Attic VHS

It really truly deeply madly underwhelmed, under delivered and under performed as only a movie truly worthy of the book could should and would properly represent this book.They don't make movies like this anymore primarily cause most movies like this try to be as bad on purpose and by doing so they really do fail miserably when compared to this classic.",1,"Dip me in a barrel of molasses then roll me off a big pile of rubbish, baby!",1398988800,"05 2, 2014",2014,1547,"['Cause', 'then', 'might', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'drenched', 'pure', 'American', 'trash', 'very', 'movie', 'My', 'god', 'unabashed', 'enthusiasm', 'film', 'makers', 'involved', 'achieve', 'sheer', 'decadence', 'absolute', 'horror', 'tawdry', 'graceless', 'garish', 'gaudiness', 'nearly', 'flaw', 'rival', 'when', 'how', 'wretchedly', 'wretched', 'modern', 'marvel', 'seedy', 'repulsive', 'exquisiteness.Call', 'fool', 'count', 'ostensibly', 'schlock', 'lovers', 'could', 'have', 'curled', 'up', 'couch', 'living', 'room', 'people', 'home', ""'d"", 'be', 'there', 'big', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'hair', 'up', 'rollers', 'ready', 'dive', 'lap', 'up', 'wonders', 'being', 'Dollanganger.The', 'only', 'true', 'shame', 'movie', 'basic', 'shamelessness', 'was', 'only', 'movie', 'released', 'cast', 'crew', 'when', 'so', 'deeply', 'so', 'surely', 'needed', 'entire', 'film', 'series', '5', 'grand', 'books', 'one', 'true', 'book', 'should', 'be', 'will', 'be', 'label', ""'The"", 'Great', 'American', 'Novel', 'should', 'will', 'be', 'Flowers', 'Attic.It', 'got', 'then', 'movie', 'really', 'truly', 'deeply', 'madly', 'lived', 'up', 'just', 'how', 'book', 'should', 'be', 'displayed', 'big', 'screen', 'really', 'truly', 'deeply', 'madly', 'underwhelmed', 'delivered', 'performed', 'only', 'movie', 'truly', 'worthy', 'book', 'could', 'should', 'would', 'properly', 'represent', 'book.They', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'movies', 'anymore', 'primarily', 'cause', 'most', 'movies', 'try', 'be', 'bad', 'purpose', 'doing', 'so', 'really', 'do', 'fail', 'miserably', 'when', 'compared', 'classic']",Flowers in the Attic VHS

The book really captures the essence of each character while the movie exploits the title of the book to make money and you end up not really feeling for the children.The only positive thing is that the grandmother's role was acted superbly, but that in no way saves this travesty.Flowers in the Attic should be made into a mini-series on A&amp;E, they know how to be true to a book, such as Pride &amp; Prejudice.The incest was only implied and never went as far as it did in the book. You can make a movie telling what actually happended without being graphic. Granted no one wants to see incest but it was essential to the story. It really shows us the ramifications of the mother's action and how it forever scarred th lives these children.As a movie itself, and if you've never read the book, the movie comes across as the Movie of the Week and the only reason you're watching it is to see what happens at the end.If you compare it to the book, you will see how horrible this movie really is.Pick up the book and enjoy.
