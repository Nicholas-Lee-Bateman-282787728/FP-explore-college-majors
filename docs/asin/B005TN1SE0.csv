1503759,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B005TN1SE0,Brent Butler,"[3, 3]","I'd never heard of the series until recently, and only stumbled across it after we recently enjoyed watching the film starring Bing Crosby. The cast is dynamite, and they are too good to fail at bringing life to the stories. But as much as I like Gene Kelly, he fails to invoke the unerring wisdom and gentle competence in the role that we enjoyed in the film. But it was a hard act to follow ... Crosby won a Best Actor Oscar for doing just what I described.These stories are slowly paced but good hearted and with depth, just not as much depth as I had hoped for. Still, with a TV series of the early 60s, it is probably as much as one could hope for.Sadly, the quality of the media has suffered. The image is dark and grainy. The sound is distorted and muddy to the point that at times I had trouble following the dialogue. I've seen TV reproductions from years earlier than this that are in pristine condition, so it's a shame that this unique series has suffered so from the ravages of time.I'll give the quality of the show a 4, but the quality of the media a 2, and average it out to a 3. This is the very rare TV role for Gene Kelly, so I can't recommend against getting this. Any dedicated Gene Kelly fan will probably find something positive here, even if he doesn't dance much. LOL I know I did.I'm not sorry to have made the purchase, but I am disappointed in the quality of the DVD presentation.",3,I wish I had better news,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,1408,"[""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'series', 'recently', 'only', 'stumbled', 'recently', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'film', 'starring', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'cast', 'dynamite', 'are', 'too', 'good', 'fail', 'bringing', 'life', 'stories', 'as', 'much', 'like', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'invoke', 'unerring', 'wisdom', 'gentle', 'competence', 'role', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'was', 'hard', 'act', 'follow', 'Crosby', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'doing', 'just', 'what', 'described.These', 'stories', 'are', 'slowly', 'paced', 'good', 'hearted', 'depth', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'depth', 'had', 'hoped', 'Still', 'TV', 'series', 'early', '60s', 'probably', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'could', 'hope', 'for.Sadly', 'quality', 'media', 'suffered', 'image', 'dark', 'grainy', 'sound', 'distorted', 'muddy', 'point', 'times', 'had', 'trouble', 'following', 'dialogue', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'TV', 'reproductions', 'years', 'earlier', 'are', 'pristine', 'condition', 'shame', 'unique', 'series', 'suffered', 'so', 'ravages', 'time.I', ""'ll"", 'give', 'quality', 'show', '4', 'quality', 'media', '2', 'average', 'out', '3', 'very', 'rare', 'TV', 'role', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'getting', 'dedicated', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'fan', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'something', 'positive', 'here', 'even', ""n't"", 'dance', 'much', 'LOL', 'know', 'did.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sorry', 'have', 'made', 'purchase', 'am', 'disappointed', 'quality', 'DVD', 'presentation']",Going My Way - The Complete Series - 30 Episodes!

1503761,A2CP4N7R587T3C,B005TN1SE0,D. A. Nicastro,"[3, 11]","When I was a child, I watched GOING MY WAY every week. All that I remembered was that Gene Kelly starred as Father O'Malley and that Leo G. Carroll was Father Fitzgibbons. When I heard about the series on DVD, I decided to purchase it. For those who think Gene Kelly can do no wrong need to take a look at this curiosity. While there may be about six good episodes, the rest are very judgmental and even offensive.The Leo G. Carroll character is the most offensive. He judges everyone and then turns around and contradicts himself. He is the reason that some Catholics may have steered away from this series (The ratings were low. The series only lasted one season.) If I were to be interested in becoming a Cathoic today and watched this series, I would choose another religion immediately. Not only is the older priest offensive, the housekeeeper is a joke. The actress is terrible. The character is the nosiest character that I have ever seen on TV (except for Gladys Kravitz, who was funny).  She, like Fitzgibbons, judges everyone. And I mean everyone! This series presents characters who are 'holier than Thou&#34; and have little understanding of human nature.Poor Dick York. He seems to be stuck in a series that really doesn't know what to do with the character that he plays. And then, there's Gene Kelly, who looks like he made a BIG mistake in doing this series. He is probably turning in his grave everytime someone watches this series.I know there are a few reviewers who thought this series showed a better time; to me it is one of the most offensive TV series ever put on television.
