499760,A238QWID7YUWU3,B00000F8FF,wearethefuture,"[0, 0]","Styles exaggerated, but yeah, people wore shoulder pads in those days.  The movie itself, I remember liking it.  Brian Wimmer was tan and young from filming China Beach.  Donna Mills in certain styles looked older and in other styles pretty and young.  The title is kind of silly because she pushes away all her boyfriends, so while it implies she is a wallflower, it is the opposite.  The stereotypes are broken a bit, but there is still the over the top Pretty Woman styles vs. the Baby Boom severe styles with a little Working Girl thrown in.  Like everyone else says, the movie is cute and nostalgic and even slightly relevant.  The title is not correct, but it does catch ones eye.  It also implies old stereo types of all women wanting to be married.  This woman wants to be married, but is afraid of relationships.  They don't really explain why, other than competing in a tough profession that requires her focus.  Then a soft-spoken male secretary applies for a job in a stream of female secretaries who worked for her with the object of getting married.  Oh boy.  Working Girl galore.  It is kind of funny no one likes Brian Wimmer's art and he has to donate it.  He says he is better at being a secretary and does the art for therapy.  So they give him a side job to even his status with the high-powered lawyer.  It is headed in a more modern direction for its day and over coming stereo types galore.  Donna Mills is quite pretty.  The side characters are also cute, and I give the dentist a break because of the main characters faux pas with him she does not see.  Then they comedic him out for plot.  Too bad not a little more conflictive triangle between him and Brian Wimmer.  He was the other love interest if there was one.  The extra guy was really silly.",3,"Catchy and silly title, Working Girl galore, nostalgic and cute.",1395100800,"03 18, 2014",2014,1775,"['Styles', 'exaggerated', 'yeah', 'people', 'wore', 'shoulder', 'pads', 'days', 'movie', 'remember', 'liking', 'Brian', 'Wimmer', 'was', 'tan', 'young', 'filming', 'China', 'Beach', 'Donna', 'Mills', 'certain', 'styles', 'looked', 'older', 'other', 'styles', 'pretty', 'young', 'title', 'kind', 'silly', 'away', 'boyfriends', 'so', 'wallflower', 'opposite', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'broken', 'bit', 'still', 'top', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Baby', 'Boom', 'severe', 'styles', 'little', 'Working', 'Girl', 'thrown', 'everyone', 'else', 'movie', 'cute', 'nostalgic', 'even', 'slightly', 'relevant', 'title', 'not', 'correct', 'catch', 'ones', 'eye', 'also', 'old', 'stereo', 'types', 'women', 'wanting', 'be', 'married', 'woman', 'be', 'married', 'afraid', 'relationships', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'explain', 'why', 'other', 'competing', 'tough', 'profession', 'focus', 'Then', 'soft-spoken', 'male', 'secretary', 'applies', 'job', 'stream', 'female', 'secretaries', 'who', 'worked', 'object', 'getting', 'married', 'Oh', 'boy', 'Working', 'Girl', 'galore', 'kind', 'funny', 'one', 'Brian', 'Wimmer', 'art', 'donate', 'better', 'being', 'secretary', 'art', 'therapy', 'give', 'side', 'job', 'even', 'status', 'high-powered', 'lawyer', 'headed', 'more', 'modern', 'direction', 'day', 'coming', 'stereo', 'types', 'galore', 'Donna', 'Mills', 'quite', 'pretty', 'side', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'cute', 'give', 'dentist', 'break', 'main', 'characters', 'faux', 'pas', 'not', 'see', 'Then', 'comedic', 'out', 'plot', 'Too', 'bad', 'not', 'little', 'more', 'conflictive', 'triangle', 'Brian', 'Wimmer', 'was', 'other', 'love', 'interest', 'was', 'one', 'extra', 'guy', 'was', 'really', 'silly']",The World's Oldest Living Bridesmaid VHS
