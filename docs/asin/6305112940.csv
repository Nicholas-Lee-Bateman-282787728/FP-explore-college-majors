449052,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6305112940,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[11, 21]","British period pieces all carry the same themes.  Two kindred hearts fight either for or against each other throughout the entire film until finally one succumbs and we are left with the clich&eacute; ""happy"" ending.  The story behind Impromptu is no different, but what makes it a bit more enjoyable than your typical film of this genre is the wiry excitement of the cast.  In other films you may find yourself struggling to stay awake with the blandish of characters, hoping that sleep with not christen you into the ending, but not in Impromptu.  Director James Lapine has amazingly gathered a very talented cast of actors/actresses like Hugh Grant, Mandy Patinkin, and Emma Thompson, to carry his film, but what shames me to say is that it does not create cinematic perfection.  These actors/actresses all have talent in which they demonstrate accordingly in this film, but (cause there is always a but...) by the end you feel as if you missed their greatest of scenes.  You feel as if you have been cheated out of their greatest potential.  This realization is formed by the film's shabby editing, it's misleading story, its emotional-less connection of characters, or the randomness of the ending.  Either way, even with the greatest players having fun with their roles, Impromptu slowly flushes itself down the period-piece toilet because it focuses itself to greatly on the actors while sinking the rest of the story.To begin, as I mentioned before, the greatness of the actors giving nearly 100% to their characters is a charm that is missed in so many other period piece films.  Impromptu kept me awake and excited about what would happen next entirely due to the characters.  Some may laugh at the portrayal of Chopin by Hugh Grant, but he contains himself well and shows that he may have some acting ""chops"" under that flopsy hair of his (even with his fading German accent).  Emma Thompson is hysterical as the dimwitted hostess, while Mandy Patinkin's Jiminy Cricket-esque character Alfred De Musset definitely needed more screen time.  Judy Davis did well with her character, I just have trouble with her ""I need to win an Oscar with every role"" type performance that Davis is notorious for giving us with every film.  The only actress that I despised throughout the film was Bernadette Peters' role.  Peters is a decent actress and has proven that she can handle some heavy performances, but her role as the ""evil"" friend in this film was extremely out of her league.  You cannot portray ""corruption"" in Peters' eyes; it is just physically impossible.  When all of these actors are together on screen, especially during their sinister performance at Thompson's house, one cannot help but be pulled into their world.  Excitement, humor, and an aura of charisma surround these characters, alas; it is what Lapine did with the rest of the film that utterly destroys it.Sarah Kernochan's story is not what is lacking when you examine Impromptu's problems.  She has amazing characters, funny situations, and socially challenged themes; it is the direction of Lapine that internally destroys the film.  The movement between the characters and situations were flawed because Lapine couldn't quite grasp the quickness of this film.  From the beginning it is established that these are some of the greatest minds in British history together on screen, so why did we have to pace through the film as if they were also the oldest characters in history.  There were times when I felt that Lapine saw the odd pacing of the story and told his actors to speed it up on screen.  This only caused more of an issue because you cannot ask the characters/actors to carry the film on their own; they need a dedicated story to complete it.  Then, when Lapine tried to counter by focusing a bit stronger on the story, he lost his characters and we, as audience members, missed out on possibly some great moments with our actors.  Impromptu eventually became a big battle of tug-of-war, where on one side the actors (doing a great job) were pulling the film, and on the other side was Lapine pulling, trying to decipher how to correctly balance the pacing and story of this genre.  While this was interesting to watch on screen, by the end of the film it is obvious that the film missed huge chunks of opportunity.  Characters moved without reason, bonds were illogically formed, and hatred was built upon mismatched moments.  It was utter and total chaos.What I am most disappointed about with this film was the lack of development towards the social oddities that surrounded our characters.  Here we have the amazing opportunity to witness a great author and the rarity of cross-dressing.  In this film we had the opportunity to develop why a powerful painter only drew dead animals.  In this film we had the opportunity to explain the passion of love, the morbid curiosity of death, and the duels that combine the two.  How about the opportunity to see the competition between Liszt and Chopin?  There were so many opportunities just lying on the floor, that by the end of this film I felt like Lapine cheated me out of so much opportunity.  Earlier I mentioned my concern about missing out on our characters because Lapine was struggling too hard with the story, it is these opportunities that I believe hurt us the most.  I was angry that we had such strong characters, amazing actors, yet no excitement in developing them.  This was just another heartache in the Lapine ""Hall of Shame"".Overall, as a character film, Impromptu was fabulous.  If you would like to see the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of British cinema doing their best, then this is the film for you.  On the flip side, if you would like to see a director's talent train wreck the entire picture, then Impromptu is also your film.  Typically, as a critic you find yourself upset with the actors, the mushy themes, or the ominous lacking of direction, for Impromptu, the latter would best describe the failures.  Lapine bit off more than he could chew and thankfully had strong actors to pick up the slack.  Sadly, that couldn't save this sinking ship.  Lapine had so much potential with Kernochan's story that I do not think he did his homework well enough.  Impromptu could have been a darkly entertaining story that could have evoked historical conversation, but instead left most of us scouring the streets looking for anything to latch onto.  I will adamantly maintain that it was due to Lapine's horrid direction that this film failed to ever take off into mainstream cinema.Grade: ** out of *****",2,Art does not apologize!,1142121600,"03

Cunningham ""Cris Cunningham""","[5, 7]","Impromptu is a amusing and clever portrayal of the 19th century love affair between composer Frederic Chopin and French romance author George Sand, the pen name of baroness Aurore Dudevant.George Sand is so captivated by the music of composer Fredric Chopin that she falls in love with him and pursues him relentlessly, while fighting off several other male suitors. In her desperate quest to win his affections, she boldly invites herself to the country home of a wealthy art patron (Emma Thompson) where other leading figures of the period are also guests. It is in this setting that we are treated to the hysterical antics of these love sick characters. Everything that can go wrong does! Finally Sand captures Chopin's attentions, but he is not immediately impressed with her. Eventually, he becomes as captivated with her gift of prose as she is with his music, and they fall in love. However, it is clear that Sand is the one who wears the pants in the relationship, literally and figuratively. She completely domintaes the relationship, but is nevertheless proves herself a loyal and loving companion.

449070,AYPWXM267TM2K,6305112940,Dexter Tay,"[53, 54]","I would unreservedly rate Impromptu five out of five after two viewings, the reason being it's the most successful period drama I've watched that combines history and farce in a most effectively entertaining manner.Each of the main characters (practically everyone has a distinct voice) are imbued with nothing short of humour and definitive caricature - a steadfast George Sand, a neurotic Chopin, an irreverant Musset, a virile Delacroix, a hyperbolic, quietly intellectual and mild Liszt, a haughty, spiteful and duplicitous Marie D'Agoult and a hysterical Countess who has been so effectively parodied as the patron of minor talents but huge inheritance.As with countless of historical dramas, Impromptu has not been spared a degree of measurement with regards to historical accuracy. I feel that a certain dispense from the facts is acceptable, so far as they remain relevant, and conducive to the development of the story and in this case, the humour.Emma Thompson has proven time and again, her mastery of period drama and her multi-faceted talents.Judy Davis and Bernadette Peters are truly brilliant and entertaining in their convincing and riveting portrayals of Sand (whom you love to emphatize with) and D'Agoult (whom you love to hate), eventually placed at loggerheads.The DVD also comes with a French voice-over not found in many films of French background filmed in English. The dialogue is much more hilarious than the original in English! (especially with George Sand and Marie D'Agoult's parts)... A boon for viewers who wish to improve on their non-native language.The soundtracks are strung together in a most admirable fashion, beginning most lightheartedly with Chopin's fleeting-paced but good-natured Impromptu in A flat, the theme of Sand's ""romantic calling"" in Chopin's first Ballade and the Fantasie-Impromptu near to the end of the film, which should be familiar to almost any viewer.Lush orchestrations have been ""mixed"" in certain parts with the original solo piano excerpts to enhance the dramatic flow. Musical purists need not be overly concerned with this mild cosmetic effect.Overall, it is a film I would recommend without hesitation to  lovers of classical music, historical drama and comedy.",5,"Excellent, Entertaining Satire",1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,2231,"['would', 'unreservedly', 'rate', 'Impromptu', 'five', 'five', 'two', 'viewings', 'reason', 'being', 'most', 'successful', 'period', 'drama', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'combines', 'history', 'farce', 'most', 'effectively', 'entertaining', 'manner.Each', 'main', 'characters', 'practically', 'everyone', 'distinct', 'voice', 'are', 'imbued', 'nothing', 'short', 'humour', 'definitive', 'caricature', 'steadfast', 'George', 'Sand', 'neurotic', 'Chopin', 'irreverant', 'Musset', 'virile', 'Delacroix', 'hyperbolic', 'quietly', 'intellectual', 'mild', 'Liszt', 'haughty', 'spiteful', 'duplicitous', 'Marie', ""D'Agoult"", 'hysterical', 'Countess', 'who', 'been', 'so', 'effectively', 'parodied', 'patron', 'minor', 'talents', 'huge', 'inheritance.As', 'countless', 'historical', 'dramas', 'Impromptu', 'not', 'been', 'spared', 'degree', 'measurement', 'regards', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'feel', 'certain', 'dispense', 'facts', 'acceptable', 'so', 'far', 'remain', 'relevant', 'conducive', 'development', 'story', 'case', 'humour.Emma', 'Thompson', 'proven', 'time', 'again', 'mastery', 'period', 'drama', 'multi-faceted', 'talents.Judy', 'Davis', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'are', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'entertaining', 'convincing', 'riveting', 'portrayals', 'Sand', 'whom', 'love', 'emphatize', ""D'Agoult"", 'whom', 'love', 'hate', 'eventually', 'placed', 'loggerheads.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'French', 'voice-over', 'not', 'found', 'many', 'films', 'French', 'background', 'filmed', 'English', 'dialogue', 'much', 'more', 'hilarious', 'original', 'English', 'especially', 'George', 'Sand', 'Marie', ""D'Agoult"", 'parts', 'boon', 'viewers', 'who', 'wish', 'improve', 'non-native', 'language.The', 'soundtracks', 'are', 'strung', 'together', 'most', 'admirable', 'fashion', 'beginning', 'most', 'lightheartedly', 'Chopin', 'fleeting-paced', 'good-natured', 'Impromptu', 'A', 'flat', 'theme', 'Sand', 'romantic', 'calling', 'Chopin', 'first', 'Ballade', 'Fantasie-Impromptu', 'end', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'familiar', 'almost', 'viewer.Lush', 'orchestrations', 'have', 'been', 'mixed', 'certain', 'parts', 'original', 'solo', 'piano', 'excerpts', 'enhance', 'dramatic', 'flow', 'Musical', 'purists', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'overly', 'concerned', 'mild', 'cosmetic', 'effect.Overall', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'hesitation', 'lovers', 'classical', 'music', 'historical', 'drama', 'comedy']",N/A

449073,AI54XO5Z755FH,6305112940,"Drake-by-the-Lake ""movie critic""","[24, 30]","I did not watch this movie in order to get educated (books are better for that), but in order to be entertained. I tend to expect historical accuracy more in novels, such as Gore Vidal's or Mary Renault's, than films, which are constrained by time and the need to please a diverse audience. I accept that a filmmaker will take considerable liberties in order to get his story across in less than two hours. There are history books available that cover the story of Sand and Chopin. And anyway, the liberties taken with facts and characters are trivial.As far as entertainment value goes, I award five stars, meaning that in my opinion, there are few if any movies that are better. Maybe it is romantic foolishness, but the scene where Sand confronts Chopin is very moving no matter how many times I watch it. Judy Davis is amazing, while Hugh Grant performs competently. Besides passion, there is abundant wit and humor. This movie richly deserves being owned. I have watched it seven times, and it only improves with time.I take strong exception with the first and foremost Editorial review of Impromptu, which appears to me of a jaded and cynical spirit. I think the movie was not given mature consideration, but judged solely on how it appealed to the author's pet political causes and infatuation with Hugh Grant.Our Amazonian author may suppose the cause of feminism must be trumpeted by every movie. If this were the case, I should stop watching movies, as would most men and women. She takes Emma Thompson, who delivered a superb performance, to task. This is a comedy, and the buffoonery is distributed irregardless of gender. The author, had she bothered to count the numerous male buffoons in the film, might by a simple calculation have drawn the opposite conclusion, and accused the film of misandrogyny.Sand, the heroine, is depicted quite favorably by Impromptu, with pluck and daring. Judy Davis is not in the slightest degree affected in her performance, though the prose of Sand herself, used in the script, was often affected and rather too flowery, but here the film is indulging in that virtue which our critic thinks it lacks, historical accuracy; as to which, there is no disputing the alliance between Chopin and Sand, which lasted many years. The details are invention, but the movie gets the character of the major players exactly right. Whether Chopin actually attended such a dinner party at such-and-such a date, and whether a certain play was performed with disasterous consequences, we may not know, but let us allow the artist some liberty to compress what could have been a very long story into less than two hours.Every moment of this film was enjoyable; the quality is uniform and never lags. To slice even five seconds (let alone twenty minutes) from the movie would be an unforgivable travesty; and in all events the movie could only be considered too short, if anything. The author disparages the wit of the movie, considering it unnecessary, but this is one of its charms. Every apparently unnecessary diversion or digression is in fact relevant to the plot and to the characters, if you bother to pay close attention to the movie. There is not a single redundant character, and every character introduced entertains and instructs in their own way, despite being caricatures or buffoons.Watching ""Impromptu"" for the eighth time tonight, I was reminded that, here, Sand falls in love not with Chopin the man, but his music, which I too love, as who could not? This is a truly Romantic version of love which transcends the physical, much like Chopin himself, whose body was feeble (he was to die of tuberculosis in his thirties). How often do we see this portrayed in movies? (Ever?) Listening to the dialogue once again confirms in my mind how well the movie captures the spirit of Romanticism, which Chopin and Sand both embodied in their own ways.The central mistake the Amazonian reviewer made was to approach this movie with expectations about Hugh Grant, Hollywood's favorite, a good-looking dullard. Numerous actors could have improved upon Grant's performance, but no one could improve upon Judy Davis as George Sand. If you can find your way to appreciating her genius, then the movie's magnificence becomes crystal clear.The quality of writing in this film is not equalled by any movie among the thousands that I have seen. It is the best movie ever made to my knowledge.",5,I take exception to the editorial review!,1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,4417,"['did', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', 'order', 'get', 'educated', 'books', 'are', 'better', 'order', 'be', 'entertained', 'tend', 'expect', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'more', 'novels', 'such', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'Mary', 'Renault', 'films', 'are', 'constrained', 'time', 'need', 'please', 'diverse', 'audience', 'accept', 'filmmaker', 'will', 'take', 'considerable', 'liberties', 'order', 'get', 'story', 'less', 'two', 'hours', 'are', 'history', 'books', 'available', 'cover', 'story', 'Sand', 'Chopin', 'anyway', 'liberties', 'taken', 'facts', 'characters', 'are', 'trivial.As', 'far', 'entertainment', 'value', 'award', 'five', 'stars', 'meaning', 'opinion', 'are', 'few', 'movies', 'are', 'better', 'Maybe', 'romantic', 'foolishness', 'scene', 'where', 'Sand', 'confronts', 'Chopin', 'very', 'moving', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'watch', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'amazing', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'competently', 'passion', 'abundant', 'wit', 'humor', 'movie', 'deserves', 'being', 'owned', 'have', 'watched', 'seven', 'times', 'only', 'time.I', 'take', 'strong', 'exception', 'first', 'foremost', 'Editorial', 'review', 'Impromptu', 'jaded', 'cynical', 'spirit', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'mature', 'consideration', 'judged', 'solely', 'how', 'appealed', 'author', 'pet', 'political', 'causes', 'infatuation', 'Hugh', 'Grant.Our', 'Amazonian', 'author', 'may', 'suppose', 'cause', 'feminism', 'must', 'be', 'trumpeted', 'movie', 'were', 'case', 'should', 'stop', 'watching', 'movies', 'as', 'would', 'most', 'men', 'women', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'delivered', 'superb', 'performance', 'task', 'comedy', 'buffoonery', 'distributed', 'irregardless', 'gender', 'author', 'had', 'bothered', 'count', 'numerous', 'male', 'buffoons', 'film', 'might', 'simple', 'calculation', 'have', 'drawn', 'opposite', 'conclusion', 'accused', 'film', 'misandrogyny.Sand', 'heroine', 'depicted', 'quite', 'favorably', 'Impromptu', 'pluck', 'daring', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'not', 'slightest', 'degree', 'affected', 'performance', 'prose', 'Sand', 'used', 'script', 'was', 'often', 'affected', 'rather', 'too', 'flowery', 'here', 'film', 'indulging', 'virtue', 'critic', 'thinks', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'disputing', 'alliance', 'Chopin', 'Sand', 'lasted', 'many', 'years', 'details', 'are', 'invention', 'movie', 'character', 'major', 'players', 'exactly', 'right', 'Whether', 'Chopin', 'actually', 'attended', 'such', 'dinner', 'party', 'such-and-such', 'date', 'certain', 'play', 'was', 'performed', 'disasterous', 'consequences', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'let', 'allow', 'artist', 'liberty', 'compress', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'long', 'story', 'less', 'two', 'hours.Every', 'moment', 'film', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'quality', 'uniform', 'never', 'lags', 'slice', 'even', 'five', 'seconds', 'let', 'alone', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'unforgivable', 'travesty', 'events', 'movie', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'considered', 'too', 'short', 'anything', 'author', 'wit', 'movie', 'considering', 'unnecessary', 'one', 'charms', 'apparently', 'unnecessary', 'diversion', 'digression', 'fact', 'relevant', 'plot', 'characters', 'bother', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'movie', 'not', 'single', 'redundant', 'character', 'character', 'introduced', 'entertains', 'instructs', 'own', 'way', 'being', 'caricatures', 'buffoons.Watching', 'Impromptu', 'eighth', 'time', 'tonight', 'was', 'reminded', 'here', 'Sand', 'love', 'not', 'Chopin', 'man', 'music', 'too', 'love', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'truly', 'Romantic', 'version', 'love', 'physical', 'much', 'Chopin', 'body', 'was', 'feeble', 'was', 'die', 'tuberculosis', 'thirties', 'How', 'often', 'do', 'see', 'portrayed', 'movies', 'Ever', 'Listening', 'dialogue', 'once', 'again', 'confirms', 'mind', 'how', 'well', 'movie', 'spirit', 'Romanticism', 'Chopin', 'Sand', 'embodied', 'own', 'ways.The', 'central', 'mistake', 'Amazonian', 'reviewer', 'made', 'was', 'approach', 'movie', 'expectations', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Hollywood', 'favorite', 'good-looking', 'dullard', 'Numerous', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'improved', 'Grant', 'performance', 'one', 'could', 'improve', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'George', 'Sand', 'can', 'find', 'way', 'appreciating', 'genius', 'then', 'movie', 'magnificence', 'crystal', 'clear.The', 'quality', 'writing', 'film', 'not', 'equalled', 'movie', 'thousands', 'have', 'seen', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'knowledge']",N/A

The main heroine (or the hero) of the film is George Sand, who is equally known for her Romantic novels and her quite scandalous at the time way of life.  For a young woman from the upper-class society, to leave her husband, take two children with her, make a living with her writing, and especially to show up in public wearing men clothing and openly smocking - it was shocking. To act like a man when it comes to love affairs - taking lovers when she felt like it and leaving them when the affair bored her was simply outrageous by the rules of the society. George Sand did not care; she had a strong personality and followed her own rules. Her contemporary, the Russian ex-patriot, famous novelist Ivan Turgenev said about her ""What a brave man she was, and what a good woman."" That's exactly who Judy Davis is playing in the little known but witty, intelligent, charmingly silly and believe it or not historically accurate movie called ""Impromptu"". It tells the story of the romance between strong and full of life George Sand and very talented romantic composer, Frederic Chopin whose music made her fall in love with him even before they met in person. It is difficult to imagine together two people more different than a delicate fragile Chopin who died young at the age of 39 from the lung illness and fiercely independent, notorious  and unorthodox George/Aurora but their romance which was the union of two lovers, close friends, and eventually more like mother - son relationship  is the historical fact. Hugh Grant in one of his earlier roles as young Polish composer and virtuoso piano-player is refined, well-mannered and very attractive. Actually all cast of the movie is delightful, Mandy Patinkin (Alfred de Musset), Jules Sands (Franz Listz), Bernadette Peters (Countess D'Agout, Listz lover, muse, and mother of his children who believed she could be even better muse for Chopin), and fabulous Emma Thompson who brought much appreciated comedy as Duchess D'Antan, rich aristocrat who sees herself as a patron of Art and the friend of the Artists. What the artists think of her is the different story.Needless to say that the film is filled with the captivating music, charming costumes, and gorgeous locations.

It is played out in this film mostly for fun.Judy Davis does a good job as Sand, the bawdy author that is thrown over by the handsome composer. Hugh Grant is exceptional as the sickly, understated, prissy and overdressed Chopin. His retrenchment at Sand's initial overtures is done tastefully and with powerful historic accuracy. Perhaps the weak point of the film is the lateness of their connection, occuring not so far in advance of Chopin's real life death at age 39 from tuberculosis.The supporting cast is wonderful in this film. Julian Sands not only looks like Franz Lizst, he plays the vacuous visionary well. Bernadette Peters is in fine form as mother to Lizst's children with her own agenda on Chopin. Mandy Patinkin steals scenes regularly in his portrayl as Sands' lover and father of her children, while Ralph Brown does good work as Chopin's real life friend, the French revolutionary artist Eugene Delacroix. Emma Thompson also plays a very funny role in the cast.Movies about classical musicians are never based in humor and are rarely as successful as this one. While ""Amadeus"" scored with fans and critics alike, it was made on a budget perhaps 100 time greater than that of ""Impromptu"". Compared to the cinematic abomination of Beethoven's life, ""Distant Beloved"", and the tawdry Ken Russell fantasy about Tchaikovsky, ""The Music Lovers"", this movie indeed sits atop an elevated pedestal.People that love classical music and/or 19th century period reenactments, and people that enjoy subtle humor, will all get a kick from this movie.

It is a wickedly funny film: sharp, biting, and clever.The sexually rapacious Ms. Sand (Judy Davis) sets her sights on the frail and finicky Frederic Chopin (Hugh Grant). Leaving a trail of outraged lovers in her wake, she devotes herself, heart and soul, to making Chopin her lover. Along the way, she finds obstacles thrust in her path, usually placed there by her erstwhile friend, Marie D'Agoult (Bernadette Peters), who is also smitten with Chopin, although she, herself, is the mistress of Franz Liszt (Julian Sand).Ms. Sand contrives to be with Chopin at all costs, in her quest to wrest his affections and capture his heart. She even brazenly invites herself for a stay in the country at the home of the Duchess D'Antan (Emma Thompson), once she discovers that Chopin is to be a guest, along with other artists of the period. This makes for some wickedly madcap moments. As her quarry makes Ms. Sand pull out all the stops, the viewer will be delightfully entertained by their antics.Judy Davis is sublime as the controversial Ms. Sand, infusing the role with intelligence and charm. Hugh Grant is perfect in the role of Chopin, who is overwhelmed by the persistent Ms. Sand. Emma Thompson, in one of her earlier roles, is absolutely hilarious as the Duchess D'Artan, the patroness of the arts, playing her character with complete comedic relish.

449097,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305112940,Matthew Horner,"[17, 19]","""Impromptu"" is a delightful historical romance about the long, tumultuous love affair between composer Frederick Chopin and novelist George Sand. It is not a biography, for the movie's script takes great license beyond the basic dates and places. The affair might have happened this way, but most probably did not. None of this much matters, though, because the movie doesn't pretend to be strictly accurate historically and because it does a good job of capturing the spirit of the times and of its characters.Judy Davis is marvelous as George Sand, a brilliant, eccentric woman who eschewed the social mores of her time. Already tired of her current lover, she is more determined than ever to dump him after she meets and falls in love with Chopin, nicely played by Hugh Grant. Chopin is portrayed as being a rather shy, morally upright [and uptight!] man who is taken aback by Sand's assertive nature and odd habits, which include dressing like a man most of the time. Undeterred by his thwarting of her advances, she pursues him relentlessly, almost getting him killed in a duel in the process. Playing an active part in all these goings on - sometimes for Sand's quest, sometimes against it - are Chopin's great friend Franz Liszt [Julian Sand] and his lover, Marie [Bernadette Peters]. Both Sand and Peters have substantial supporting roles, as do Emma Thompson and Mandy Patinkin. The cast alone makes ""Impromptu"" worth seeing. Also enjoyable is the soundtrack, almost all of which is taken from Chopin's works.As history, this movie is dubious. As entertainment, it's first rate.

He is most famous for his collaborations with Stephen Sondheim including Sunday in the Park with George, Passion and Into the Woods.  He brings this talent to the big screen.George Sand was a great French writer.  Since society thought that women should be subservient housewives, George wanted to fly in the face of society.  She wrote under a man's name and dressed like a man.  She treated men as playthings. Therefore, she was the scandal and titillation of Paris.That is until she is introduced to the shy Polish composer Frederic Chopin. When she hears his music, she becomes enchanted with him.  But Frederic wants nothing to do with such a notorious woman.  So George decides to give Frederic a woman that he wants.This is a brilliant romantic comedy with a cast of up and coming actors.  Judy Davis has always chosen interesting role from her early Australian films to her television roles.  This is another great meaty role for Judy and she eats it up.  Hugh Grant was a relative unknown when this film was made but this film would be the first of the quintessential Hugh Grant characters.

449108,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,6305112940,"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya""","[11, 14]","This 1991 movie directed by James Lepine is an absolute charm. It's a romantic comedy, it's a historical piece and a colorful introduction to the music of Frederic Chopin, Franz Liszt and the life and writings of Madame George Sand Aurore Dudevant. The romantic comedy is well-written, the actors are doing top-notch performances and the music is heaven. I don't know yet if there is a soundtrack but it's likely there is and it must be beautiful. George Sand was the pen name of the feminist writer Aurore Dudevant who scandalized proper Victorian society in the 19th century by dressing as a man, smoking cigars, abandoning her wealthy and respected husband to live the liberal lifestyle of a bohemian writer of novels. She had many lovers, including Alfred De Musset (who is played in this film by Mandy Patinkin)and her most famous lover, Frederic Chopin. It is their love story that this movie focues on. Stars Judi Davis as George Sand, Hugh Grant as Chopin and Bernadette Peters as the Countess Marie D'Agoult. I will not give away the answer. But Chopin, though he never married Sand, was greatly influenced by his knowing her and his most productive period of composing piano music came after their heartbreaking seperation. Chopin died young of tubercolosis. It's very possible that he loved George Sand but I'm thinking that for Sand, no man was really ever good enough for her. After all, she was the embodiment of the feminist, independent single woman who did'nt really need marriage or love.Judi Davis is doing an Oscar winning performance as George Sand, who is ultimately a woman who belongs to no one and who lives life to the fullest. She has raised children to be as creative as she is and taken full responsibility for her children as well as for her elderly mother. Bored of the dull life after her divorce from the father of her children, she takes her current lover to the French countryside. There, she is invited by a wealthy hostess to her estate. The drama heightens in a soap opera sort of way when none other than Alfred De Musset the poet and ex-lover of Sand shows up. Her jealous boyfriend, Malfitte, challenges him to a duel. Meanwhile, Sand has fallen for Chopin, who is her polar opposite. While she is free, intense, devil-may-care and very healthy, Chopin is reserved, emotional, sensitive, refined and suffering of bad health with tubercolosis. Their relationship is accurate to truth but not in the way the film depicts. The disaster that happens in the country estate, comedically produced, never really happened. Bernadette Peters delivers a terrific performance as well as the scheming and bitter Marie D'Agoult, whose own marriage to Franz Liszt after having many children with him, including Cosima who later marries Richard Wagner, but that's another story and even another movie. This is a well-done movie with lots of charm and witty scenes. I especially enjoyed the entire portion in the country estate, in which the artist Delacroix, Franz Liszt and Chopin discuss over dinner the existence of God in front of a priest, put on a satirical farce play that ends badly and Sand's adorable children who are always finding some excuse to play with explosives and dynomite.",5,George Sand And Chopin: Romantic Comedy,1084492800,"05 14, 2004",2004,3217,"['1991', 'movie', 'directed', 'James', 'Lepine', 'absolute', 'charm', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'historical', 'piece', 'colorful', 'introduction', 'music', 'Frederic', 'Chopin', 'Franz', 'Liszt', 'life', 'writings', 'Madame', 'George', 'Sand', 'Aurore', 'Dudevant', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'well-written', 'actors', 'are', 'doing', 'top-notch', 'performances', 'music', 'heaven', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'soundtrack', 'likely', 'must', 'be', 'beautiful', 'George', 'Sand', 'was', 'pen', 'name', 'feminist', 'writer', 'Aurore', 'Dudevant', 'who', 'scandalized', 'proper', 'Victorian', 'society', '19th', 'century', 'dressing', 'man', 'smoking', 'cigars', 'abandoning', 'wealthy', 'respected', 'husband', 'live', 'liberal', 'lifestyle', 'bohemian', 'writer', 'novels', 'had', 'many', 'lovers', 'including', 'Alfred', 'De', 'Musset', 'who', 'played', 'film', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'most', 'famous', 'lover', 'Frederic', 'Chopin', 'love', 'story', 'movie', 'Stars', 'Judi', 'Davis', 'George', 'Sand', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Chopin', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'Countess', 'Marie', ""D'Agoult"", 'will', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'answer', 'Chopin', 'never', 'married', 'Sand', 'was', 'greatly', 'influenced', 'knowing', 'most', 'productive', 'period', 'composing', 'piano', 'music', 'came', 'heartbreaking', 'seperation', 'Chopin', 'died', 'young', 'tubercolosis', 'very', 'possible', 'loved', 'George', 'Sand', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'Sand', 'man', 'was', 'really', 'ever', 'good', 'enough', 'was', 'embodiment', 'feminist', 'independent', 'single', 'woman', 'who', 'really', 'need', 'marriage', 'love.Judi', 'Davis', 'doing', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'George', 'Sand', 'who', 'ultimately', 'woman', 'who', 'one', 'who', 'life', 'fullest', 'raised', 'children', 'be', 'as', 'creative', 'taken', 'full', 'responsibility', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'elderly', 'mother', 'Bored', 'dull', 'life', 'divorce', 'father', 'children', 'current', 'lover', 'French', 'countryside', 'invited', 'wealthy', 'hostess', 'estate', 'drama', 'soap', 'opera', 'sort', 'way', 'when', 'none', 'other', 'Alfred', 'De', 'Musset', 'poet', 'ex-lover', 'Sand', 'up', 'jealous', 'boyfriend', 'Malfitte', 'duel', 'Meanwhile', 'Sand', 'fallen', 'Chopin', 'who', 'polar', 'opposite', 'free', 'intense', 'devil-may-care', 'very', 'healthy', 'Chopin', 'reserved', 'emotional', 'sensitive', 'refined', 'suffering', 'bad', 'health', 'tubercolosis', 'relationship', 'accurate', 'truth', 'not', 'way', 'film', 'depicts', 'disaster', 'country', 'estate', 'comedically', 'produced', 'never', 'really', 'happened', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'terrific', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'scheming', 'bitter', 'Marie', ""D'Agoult"", 'own', 'marriage', 'Franz', 'Liszt', 'having', 'many', 'children', 'including', 'Cosima', 'who', 'later', 'Richard', 'Wagner', 'story', 'even', 'movie', 'well-done', 'movie', 'lots', 'charm', 'witty', 'scenes', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'entire', 'portion', 'country', 'estate', 'artist', 'Delacroix', 'Franz', 'Liszt', 'Chopin', 'discuss', 'dinner', 'existence', 'God', 'front', 'priest', 'put', 'satirical', 'farce', 'play', 'badly', 'Sand', 'adorable', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'always', 'finding', 'excuse', 'play', 'explosives', 'dynomite']",N/A

Judy Davis is wonderful as the tomboyish George Sand (though slightly over the top at times) and gives the role quite a bit of depth and comedy. Hugh Grant plays her quarry, Fredrick Chopin, and even dons a wavering accent for the part. The cake, however, is taken by Emma Thompson here in her before-stardom days. She plays a culturally deprived Countess who invites the geniuses of the day to her country home where many of the madcap endeavors take place. Her performance alone makes this film worth watching.The setting is France in its most romantic years, where George Sand scandalized the towns by her illicit love affairs, one after the other. An obstacle is met, however, in the frail form of Chopin, whose music she first heard and fell in love with. The fortunes are against the pair, mostly in the form of her devious friend Marie who actually wants Chopin for herself. Her numerous broken relationships with previous lovers get a bit annoying and dull at times but the rest of the film makes up for it.A scene I particularly enjoyed was the farce-play put on by the 'geniuses' that positively humiliates their hosts and accuses them of being 'stupid'. It's so halarious watching Emma Thompson's face falling bit by bit as she realizes the play is actually about her.All in all, a film worth watching, and, while it is not meticulously-crafted, is still great fun for the performances and sheer comedic power.

449116,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,6305112940,Themis-Athena,"[37, 44]","Poor Mallefille - you really have to pity him.  Not only has he become the lover of the woman who employed him to tutor her children (and whose reputation is hard to take for his pathologically jealous nature anyway); only to be dumped again in short order, when she has had enough of him and his fits of jealousy.  Not only does he have to watch her exchange witticisms and confidences with a host of other men, many of them belonging to the Parisian art circles where he himself will never be taken seriously (and God knows what else they may be exchanging or have exchanged in the past).  Not only is he being bossed around by a woman who has taken a male pen name, insists on dressing in men's clothes, refuses to use a woman's saddle when riding (and what a horsewoman she is!) and prefers an afternoon out hunting to one sipping tea in the company of other ladies of society.  No:  after having taken all that, and having dared to demand the satisfaction to which he feels so justly entitled from her latest object of romantic interest, one feeble Polish composer named Chopin - only to see the guy fainting before the obligatory count has even gotten to ""ten"" and never raise his pistol at all - what does the wretched woman do?  She seizes Chopin's weapon, fires at Mallefille, injures his arm and responds coolly, when he has finally overcome his shock and disbelief and inquires how, after all their time together, she could do such a thing: ""It was easy.  You're a menace to the future of art.""As this movie would have it, the above scene (never to be revealed to Chopin, in order not to hurt his pride) brought about the final turning point in one of history's most famous love stories, the romance between prolific French writer George Sand (born 1804 as Amandine Aurore Lucile Dupin and married, in 1822, to Baron Casimir Dudevant, whom she left in 1835) and quintessential Romantic composer and Polish musical prodigy Frederic (Fryderyk) Chopin, six years her junior, who after a life-long struggle with his health succumbed to tuberculosis at the age of 39 years.  While taking some liberties with the real course of events, ""Impromptu"" does portray their relationship up to their departure for Majorca, as well as the story's backdrop in 19th century Paris and rural France, with an admirably light touch and in loving detail; marvelously framed by a score consisting almost exclusively of pieces by Chopin himself.  Judy Davis and a deliciously young and fragile Hugh Grant are the perfect embodiment of Sand and her ""Chopinet"" - she, a feisty no-nonsense woman used to fighting for her place in the world, who can nevertheless lose herself completely in Chopin's music, which she considers divine; he, sickly, uptight and at first severely taken aback by her manner which so contradicts accepted female behavior that he almost doubts she is a woman at all (a remark actually attributed to Chopin and resounding in the movie's interpretation of their initial encounter, after Sand has hidden in his room to hear him play and leaves her hiding place when he stops, pleading with him to continue, only to be rebuked by a seriously upset Chopin: ""Rumor has it that you are a woman, so I must ask you to leave my private chambers. ... This is ridiculously improper - and frightening as well!"")Although Sand and Chopin were really introduced to each other by their joint friend Franz Liszt and his companion Marie d'Agoult (here portrayed with fervor and panache by Julian Sands and Bernadette Peters), the movie ingeniously places their first meeting onto the country estate of the Duke d'Antan and his wife Claudette, self-declared patroness of the arts (played by an exuberant Emma Thompson, who milks the role for all it's worth and then some), who has assembled the cream of the Parisian arts scene; besides Chopin, Liszt and Marie most notably Sand's former lover, poet Alfred de Musset (Mandy Patinkin) and painter Eugene Delacroix (Ralph Brown).  Sand, who is actually not among the invitees, spontaneously proceeds to invite herself when she hears that Chopin will be among the guests, because she has wanted to meet him ever since she first heard him play in the Paris salon of Baroness Laginsky (Elizabeth Spriggs) - thus guaranteeing plenty of tumultuous scenes between herself and de Musset as well as between the latter and Mallefille (Georges Corraface), who (likewise uninvited) appears shortly after her in dogged pursuit of the woman who has recently dumped him; a fact he is patently unwilling to accept.Although initially rejected by Chopin, Sand is not in the least willing to give up on him; and she greedily accepts Marie's advice after their return to Paris:  ""He is not a man; he's a woman. ... You must win him as a man wins a woman.  If anyone can do it, you can."" And while Marie's counsel is far less disinterested and well-meaning than George thinks, in the end her new tactics do the trick; albeit only after a series of heated encounters between the two would-be lovers, Chopin and de Musset and Chopin and Marie; and not before Sand has lost her mother (Anna Massey), her most undying champion.  Chopin and Sand eventually become friends and - we are told - finally lovers after Mallefille has forever left the battlefield in shame.Although there would be an estrangement between the star-crossed lovers shortly before Chopin's death, he did remain, as Sand wrote in her autobiography, the greatest love of her life; and in turn, the years they spent together are considered by many the most fertile years of his musical career.  They both will live forever in their works - and this movie, which unfortunately went virtually undiscovered upon its 1991 release, is a wonderful, gentle reminder of the wealth of creativity and emotion they had to share.Also recommended:Story of My Life: The Autobiography of George Sand (Women Writers in Translation)MarianneChopin: Piano Concertos Nos. 1 & 2Chopin, Liszt: Piano Concertos /

449117,ASJ89T42CIUHU,6305112940,V. Marshall,"[6, 8]","This is a nicely done period movie depicting the life and loves of the controversial 19th century French writer George Sand.George Sand was one of the world's first feminists, preferring to personify the life of a male rather than cower to the nitwit life of a woman in the 19th century. Sand chose to divorce an abusive husband, make a living as a writer and stand up for her beliefs although they were harshly criticized during her era. As a writer Sand took on the flaws of society in her characters and scolded the public in her subtle but effective way. As a woman Sand was far from beautiful but she had numerous affairs of the heart with many famous and powerful men. She managed to thrill her lovers with her mind and her ever present need to be free from constraints, preferring to set her lovers free yet they always came running back for more or went crazy doing so. Needless to say Sand is an extraordinarily interesting subject but to really know her one must read about her because she is far too limited by film.This film is wonderful but incomplete. Judy Davis plays the great George Sand about as perfectly as she can be played on film. Davis takes on the famous characteristics of Sand, the tomboyish walk, her bold feministic approach and her enduring passion for life and love. In this film Sand is introduced only briefly as a young girl without much explanation as to how she arrived at her independent nature. Sand is already a successful writer dividing her time between her estate, Nohant, and Paris. She is frustrated because she has fallen out of ""like"" with her children's tutor (who continues to pursue her madly), but soon becomes infatuated with Frederic Chopin, a frail and sickly Polish composer. As she pursues Chopin, she continues to deny former lovers such as poet Alfred de Musset. The film is actually quite entertaining although much of the history involved in these famous relationships is lost in the effort. Hugh Grant is convincingly fragile and helpless as Chopin. Mandy Patinkin insanely perfect as Alfred de Musset. Bernadette Peters is great as the backstabbing and snide social climber, Marie D'Agoult. But this movie would not be complete without the comic wit of Emma Thompson as a rich but bored Duchess who preys on the artistic talent willing to spend time at her estate.George Sand is too much woman to be contained in one film but she is almost captured in Judy Davis's performance. Had the filmmakers made this movie into a mini-series instead I believe it would have done history and Ms. Sand more justice. However this glimpse into the life of an amazing individual who stood alone against her own machine will inspire you to read and search for more details about Sand's fabulous life.",4,A Spontaneous Life,1095120000,"09 14, 2004",2004,2745,"['nicely', 'done', 'period', 'movie', 'depicting', 'life', 'loves', 'controversial', '19th', 'century', 'French', 'writer', 'George', 'Sand.George', 'Sand', 'was', 'one', 'world', 'first', 'feminists', 'preferring', 'personify', 'life', 'male', 'rather', 'cower', 'nitwit', 'life', 'woman', '19th', 'century', 'Sand', 'chose', 'divorce', 'abusive', 'husband', 'make', 'living', 'writer', 'stand', 'up', 'beliefs', 'were', 'harshly', 'criticized', 'era', 'writer', 'Sand', 'took', 'flaws', 'society', 'characters', 'scolded', 'public', 'subtle', 'effective', 'way', 'woman', 'Sand', 'was', 'far', 'beautiful', 'had', 'numerous', 'affairs', 'heart', 'many', 'famous', 'powerful', 'men', 'managed', 'thrill', 'lovers', 'mind', 'ever', 'present', 'need', 'be', 'free', 'constraints', 'preferring', 'set', 'lovers', 'free', 'yet', 'always', 'came', 'running', 'back', 'more', 'went', 'crazy', 'doing', 'so', 'Needless', 'say', 'Sand', 'extraordinarily', 'interesting', 'subject', 'really', 'know', 'one', 'must', 'read', 'far', 'too', 'limited', 'film.This', 'film', 'wonderful', 'incomplete', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'great', 'George', 'Sand', 'as', 'perfectly', 'can', 'be', 'played', 'film', 'Davis', 'famous', 'characteristics', 'Sand', 'tomboyish', 'walk', 'bold', 'feministic', 'approach', 'enduring', 'passion', 'life', 'love', 'film', 'Sand', 'introduced', 'only', 'briefly', 'young', 'girl', 'much', 'explanation', 'how', 'arrived', 'independent', 'nature', 'Sand', 'already', 'successful', 'writer', 'dividing', 'time', 'estate', 'Nohant', 'Paris', 'frustrated', 'fallen', 'children', 'tutor', 'who', 'pursue', 'madly', 'soon', 'becomes', 'infatuated', 'Frederic', 'Chopin', 'frail', 'sickly', 'Polish', 'composer', 'Chopin', 'deny', 'former', 'lovers', 'such', 'poet', 'Alfred', 'Musset', 'film', 'actually', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'much', 'history', 'involved', 'famous', 'relationships', 'lost', 'effort', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'convincingly', 'fragile', 'helpless', 'Chopin', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'insanely', 'perfect', 'Alfred', 'Musset', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'great', 'backstabbing', 'snide', 'social', 'climber', 'Marie', ""D'Agoult"", 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'complete', 'comic', 'wit', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'rich', 'bored', 'Duchess', 'who', 'preys', 'artistic', 'talent', 'willing', 'spend', 'time', 'estate.George', 'Sand', 'too', 'much', 'woman', 'be', 'contained', 'one', 'film', 'almost', 'captured', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'performance', 'Had', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'movie', 'mini-series', 'instead', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'history', 'Ms', 'Sand', 'more', 'justice', 'However', 'glimpse', 'life', 'amazing', 'individual', 'who', 'stood', 'alone', 'own', 'machine', 'will', 'inspire', 'read', 'search', 'more', 'details', 'Sand', 'fabulous', 'life']",N/A
