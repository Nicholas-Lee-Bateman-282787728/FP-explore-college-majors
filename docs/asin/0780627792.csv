Not this one partner, I don't think anyone could look at this woman long enough with out charging! Jaime Pressly (Violet) was a perfect beauty with an extreme sexy voice and smurk! Gee Wizz...she was the best I have ever seen in any of these so called seduction flicks! There are a billion of them at the video houses but this one is supreme over all. The pool scene was amazing and Jamie's body is so so natural and flawless! I can understand how she succeeded in this film with her rampage! I think anyone would have fell for this web of deceit. The big downfall to this movie is the rushed ending. If it wasn't for the ending I would have given it *****'s. The ending was disappointing because the movie trotted so well. In all honesty I think they were running out of film and money. Jaimie's character was so slick and beguiling and in control. Then all of a sudden she just lost it and control of everything and it didn't flow in my opinion. Noone that slick and smart just gets sloppy without some reasonable explanation. But all the way up to the last 15mins of the movie it is an exotic masterpiece! If you are looking for other great Seduction movies with a Convincing in appearance female? Check for Lost Highway and Lifeforce!  I don't think there will ever be another (Grade C) seductress film this Perfect in appearance or performance.

35824,A2WHQZXGP0DOYS,0780627792,Buddy S,"[4, 4]","The star of this film, Jaime Pressly, has recently been commended for her acting ability.  In early 2006 she received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress for her role in the TV comedy series ""My Name is Earl.""  Also, in early October, 2006, she was guest host on NBC's Saturday Night Live.  Ms. Pressly has the unique ability, by changing her facial expressions (using mostly her large blue eyes and mouth) to instantly transform her appearance from a beautiful seductress to a freaked out psycho.This film dates back to the beginning of Pressly's career.  Throughout nearly the entire movie, Ms. Pressly is in full blown seductress mode and she plays this role extremely well.The plot, unfortunately, is fairly predictable.  Violet is a pre-adolescent girl who lives in a California mansion with her sister Ivy and her mother, who is the housekeeper.  The mansion is owned by Ivan Greer and his wife Katherine, who live there with their young daughter Joy, a close friend of Violet and Ivy.  Violet's family is suddenly evicted from the home when Katherine Greer discovers that her husband is having an affair with Violet's mother.  The story then jumps ahead 11 years, when Violet (Pressly), who is now a 20 year old woman, returns as a visitor to her former home and apparently intends to claim what she believes to be rightfully hers.  Initially, Violet seems intent on becoming the female head of the household, but that goal shifts somewhat as the plot unfolds.One can anticipate that any film that has the word ""seduction"" in the title will have a heavy emphasis on sex and this film does not disappoint.  In the process of achieving her goals, Violet seduces each of the two main male characters in the film.  Violet (Ms. Pressly) appears in four sex scenes.  There are two additional scenes where she performs without any partner, stripping for the camera and displaying her charms, one while taking a bath and the other in a swimming pool.  Also, early in the film Violet's Mom, played by Athena Massey, is in one sex scene.The DVD has both ""R"" rated and ""unrated"" versions of the film and each version is available in both wide screen and full screen video.  Audio is available in Dolby 5.1.  There are no ""extras"" on the disk, except for a cast list and chapter menu.As might be expected, the ""unrated"" version of this film has the look and feel of soft core porn that is available on late night cable, but the sex scenes in this movie are far more erotic than the typical fare and the acting is well above average for this genre.  Notwithstanding the predictable plot, this film is engaging and fun to watch.  The sex is hot and Jaime Pressly looks fantastic.  No body double appears to be used in any of her nude scenes.It is unusual to see an acclaimed mainstream actress performing in a relatively large number of sex scenes and showing extensive quantities of skin, as Ms. Pressly does throughout this film.  If your interests run in this direction, or if you just want to see good soft core porn, I recommend this movie.",4,Jaime Pressly: Seductress Extraordinaire,1160611200,"10 12, 2006",2006,3056,"['star', 'film', 'Jaime', 'Pressly', 'recently', 'been', 'commended', 'acting', 'ability', 'early', '2006', 'received', 'Emmy', 'nomination', 'Outstanding', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'role', 'TV', 'comedy', 'series', 'Name', 'Earl', 'Also', 'early', 'October', '2006', 'was', 'guest', 'host', 'NBC', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Ms.', 'Pressly', 'unique', 'ability', 'changing', 'facial', 'expressions', 'using', 'mostly', 'large', 'blue', 'eyes', 'mouth', 'instantly', 'transform', 'appearance', 'beautiful', 'seductress', 'freaked', 'out', 'psycho.This', 'film', 'dates', 'back', 'beginning', 'Pressly', 'career', 'nearly', 'entire', 'movie', 'Ms.', 'Pressly', 'full', 'blown', 'seductress', 'mode', 'role', 'extremely', 'well.The', 'plot', 'unfortunately', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'Violet', 'pre-adolescent', 'girl', 'who', 'California', 'mansion', 'sister', 'Ivy', 'mother', 'who', 'housekeeper', 'mansion', 'owned', 'Ivan', 'Greer', 'wife', 'Katherine', 'who', 'live', 'there', 'young', 'daughter', 'Joy', 'close', 'friend', 'Violet', 'Ivy', 'Violet', 'family', 'suddenly', 'evicted', 'home', 'when', 'Katherine', 'Greer', 'husband', 'having', 'affair', 'Violet', 'mother', 'story', 'then', 'ahead', '11', 'years', 'when', 'Violet', 'Pressly', 'who', 'now', '20', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'visitor', 'former', 'home', 'apparently', 'claim', 'what', 'be', 'rightfully', 'hers', 'Initially', 'Violet', 'intent', 'becoming', 'female', 'head', 'household', 'goal', 'shifts', 'somewhat', 'plot', 'unfolds.One', 'can', 'anticipate', 'film', 'word', 'seduction', 'title', 'will', 'have', 'heavy', 'emphasis', 'sex', 'film', 'not', 'disappoint', 'process', 'achieving', 'goals', 'Violet', 'two', 'main', 'male', 'characters', 'film', 'Violet', 'Ms.', 'Pressly', 'four', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'two', 'additional', 'scenes', 'where', 'partner', 'stripping', 'camera', 'displaying', 'charms', 'one', 'while', 'taking', 'bath', 'other', 'swimming', 'pool', 'Also', 'early', 'film', 'Violet', 'Mom', 'played', 'Athena', 'Massey', 'one', 'sex', 'scene.The', 'DVD', 'R', 'rated', 'unrated', 'versions', 'film', 'version', 'available', 'wide', 'screen', 'full', 'screen', 'video', 'Audio', 'available', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'are', 'extras', 'disk', 'cast', 'list', 'chapter', 'menu.As', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'unrated', 'version', 'film', 'look', 'feel', 'soft', 'core', 'porn', 'available', 'late', 'night', 'cable', 'sex', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'erotic', 'typical', 'fare', 'acting', 'well', 'above', 'average', 'genre', 'Notwithstanding', 'predictable', 'plot', 'film', 'engaging', 'fun', 'watch', 'sex', 'hot', 'Jaime', 'Pressly', 'fantastic', 'body', 'double', 'be', 'used', 'nude', 'scenes.It', 'unusual', 'see', 'acclaimed', 'mainstream', 'actress', 'performing', 'relatively', 'large', 'number', 'sex', 'scenes', 'showing', 'extensive', 'quantities', 'skin', 'Ms.', 'Pressly', 'film', 'interests', 'run', 'direction', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'soft', 'core', 'porn', 'recommend', 'movie']",N/A

She and her mother live in a house owned by Ivan Greer (Michael Des Barres).  Joy (Megan Edwards) is Ivan's daughter.  Ivan and Violet's mother are having an affair, but they get caught by Ivan's wife.  Soon, Violet and her mother are thrown out of the house.  The Greer's continue living in the house, but Ivan's wife ends up passing away, so Ivan and Joy are left by themselves in the house.The movie moves ahead eleven years.  Ivan is working as a successful bank executive, Joy is a star tennis player who's engaged to Michael (Greg Vaughan), an Ivy-league finance major who's trying to get a job as an intern at Ivan's bank.  Everything seems fine, until one day, there's a knock on the door.  The housekeeper opens it to find a very grown-up Violet.  Violet claims that she moved to Arizona, but has returned to work as a waitress and attend Junior College, but she has no place to live.  Joy suggests that she move in with them.  After a little convincing, Ivan agrees, and Violet moves in.Joy and Violet have fun catching up, and Joy introduces Violet to her college friends, but they find her ""different"", and pay very little attention to her.  She gets up to go to her waitress job, but it turns out that she's really a prostitute.  After a while, she returns to the house, where she finds Michael.  Michael and Joy went up to her room, but Joy wasn't interested in making love with Michael.  Now, Violet has found him, and she seduces him.Joy's friend Jamie then comes over to help her train for her big tennis match.  After playing for a while, they take a break.  Violet spikes the juice with rum, and both Jamie and Joy get very drunk.  The housekkeper has become very suspicious of Violet, and her suspicions are confirmed shortly thereafter.  Ivan makes a date with another woman,and she calls to tell Ivan where to pick her up at.  Violet answers the phone and promises to give Ivan the message, but she never does.  Ivan comes home feeling that he's been stood up.  Violet is there to comfort him, and eventually, the two have sex.Things continue on at this pace until Michael shows up again.  Violet was swimming nude in the pool and noticed Michael watching her.  She gets out of the pool and offers cocaine to Michael.  A recovering drug user, he declines at first, but in the end, he gives in.  Violet and Michael have sex again, and Violet plants the cocaine vial in his jacket.  This is eventually found by Ivan, who shows it to Joy.  Michael ends up losing out on his internship.Joy is so distraught by Michael's apparent drug use that she blows her big tennis match.  Michael confronts Violet and tells her that he knows about her and what she's doing.  He goes back to the house and begins going through Violet's things.  he finds Violet's sex toys hiding under her bed, but she sneaks in and knocks him out.  When he wakes up, he's been handcuffed and had duct tape put over his mouth.  Violet then injects him with a drug, which ends up killing him.What will happen to Ivan and Joy?  Will they suffer the same fate as Michael?I thought this movie was good, but it falls slightly short of the original movie.  Jamie Pressly is extremely sexy and does a good job as the scheming yet beautiful Violet.  Megan Edwards is good as Joy, and I was glad to see her stand up to Violet in the end.  The plot is a little more complicated than the first two movies.  The acting is lukewarm at best, but Pressly and Edwards are both very good.I do recommend this movie. Jamie Pressly makes the movie worth watching.

35827,A34D06JL7LC6MU,0780627792,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 4]","I rented this movie for the same reason many males do. Jaime Pressly (the redneck chick from such movies as Joe Dirt and the TV show My Name is Earl) made her film debut with this direct-to-video sequel. And in this film, she takes off her clothes. Believe me, that's the reason that 97% of the people who watch this movie watch it for. The other 3% is people who are forced to watch it with those people. I've never seen the first Poison Ivy (which starred Drew Barrymore) or the 2nd (Alyssa Milano); But, this plot is relatively connected. The movie begins at a large house, probably in California. Two young sisters named Ivy and Violet are playing with their friend Joy, while their mother (who is the house, housekeeper and looks way too young to have children...And way way too hot) has sex with some guy. The owner of the house (Joy's father) comes home and catches them in the act. Apparently Joy's father, Ivan and Ivy and Violet's Mom are having an affair; Which Ivan's wife finds out about. Flash forward a few years later. Ivan (Michael Des Barres) is divorced, Joy (Megan Edwards) is all grown up and engaged to Michael (Greg Vaughan). Everything's perfect is Suburbia. Then Violet (Pressly) shows up on their doorstep with seemingly innocent intentions. Of course, the viewer knows that isn't so. Soon, Violet begins working a mind game (that like so many movie mind games would never work in real life) in an attempt to ruin Joy's life. Technically, she has a motive. But, she's kind of taking it out on the wrong person. While the writer does make Violet slightly crazy, she's obviously not insane...So, why doesn't she ever think about what she's doing? Nothing I've written so far even really matters. Let's face it, most of you are not going to rent it for the story. The movie, for a direct-to-video movie, isn't that bad actually. Sure, the story's pretty stupid...But its entertaining and Pressly bares near all. This movie is not a masterpiece; If you're not a testosterone driven guy, you probably won't like this movie that much. If you don't like Jaime Pressly, you probably won't like this movie that much.

Dudley,"[14, 17]","Poison Ivy: The New Seduction is the third film in the soft-core erotic thriller series that began with the 1992 theatrical release of the first film starring Drew Barrymore and continued with the awful 1995 direct-to-video sequel starring Alyssa Milano.This third 1997 direct-to-video entry in the pointless series stars a then relative unknown Jaime Pressly (no relation to Elvis) who actually was Drew Barrymore's nude body double in the original movie. She has a nice body and is frequently nude, but trying to make it through this movie is the equivalent of smacking yourself upside the head with the DVD box for 95 minutes straight.The ""plot"" (if you can call it that ) involves a young girl named Violet (Jaime Pressly) who moves in with her childhood friend Joy Greer(Megan Edwards) and Joy's wealthy father Ivan (Michael Des Barres). Turns out that Joy and Violet were childhood friends and Joy's parents seperated when her mom found out that her father had an affair. Anyone with a working brain cell knows that Violet intends to take over the house and move in on Joy's father so she can get to his money. Violet is also a hooker and proceeds to try to ruin everyone's lives while trying to get what she wants. At one point she interferes with Joy and her boyfriend by slipping a drug in some punch to knock Joy out for awhile. While she's incapcitated, Violet seduces Joy's boyfriend. She also does her best to flirt with Joy's dad by putting on some of his wive's slinkiest dresses that for some reason still hang in his bedroom closet. The movie culminates with a finale that is as laughable as it is just plain stupid in which Violet ends up holding Joy and some other people as hostages in their own home while she tells them what her true intentions were all along.If I had tried to type a plot synopsis for this movie any longer I'm sure my brain would have exploded.......While I liked the first Poison Ivy on a purely guilty pleasure level, anyone who has seen the 2nd one starring Alyssa Milano knows that these movies have become nothing but an excuse to see a very attractive young up & coming actress nude and (hopefully) in numerous explicit sexual situations.Well, Poison Ivy 3 fails on all levels. First of all, there isn't all that much sex in the movie and most of what is shown isn't that much more explicit than some R-rated soft-core fare. The DVD my friend had insisted that I borrow from him (because he thinks that Jaime Pressly is the greatest thing since sliced bread) has both the R-rated and unrated cuts on it. The only version I watched was the unrated version and a comparison of the running times list on the box seemed to show that the R-rated cut was missing about 2 minutes of (presumably) sex that was in the unrated cut.Most of the more explicit stuff is implied and framed in a way that you don't actually see the act taking place (like a potentially hot but completely squandered scene in which Violet gives Joy's boyfriend oral sex in the piano room for instance.) I thought this was inexcusable. Soft-core porn thrillers are supposed to be crammed with explicit sex. Maybe if the director and cast had been a lot more willing throw in all kinds of kinky and explicit sex at the very least this movie would been worth a rental just for that. This was planned as an unrated film all along so if I had been the filmmaker I would have delivered on what people wanted to see: Jamie Pressly having lots of explicit simulated sex!Another problem is that I just didn't find Jaime Pressly to be all that attractive (and I'm sure I'm in the minority here). Sure, her body is toned and quite nice to look at, but her face was just horrible. It literally looks like someone stretched her eyes over her face. Also, her voice was the equivalent of someone scratching their nails down a chalkboard. She made me cringe everytime she opened her mouth. Fans of the now somewhat famous actress will find a lot to like as she does a bunch of nude scenes including one where she pours wine over her bare breasts while seducing Joy's boyfriend. (She has an absolutely fantastic butt BTW.)The acting is terrible, and the direction is comparable to a really bad made-for-TV movie that you might see on the USA network. There's just not one redeemable thing about this whole movie IMO. Even funnier, my girlfriend fell asleep about 15 minutes into the movie and woke up near the end. She was able to summarize everything that has happened since this movie is nothing but a treasure trove of soft-core cliches.But hardly anyone watches these type of films for the story, and I guess if you find Jaime Pressly attractive than this movie will make a worthwhile rental. But if you're like me, and you don't find her to be all that she's cracked up to be looks-wise, this movie should be avoided at all costs.Poison Ivy:The New Seduction is unrated and contains strong

I mean, what else could there possibly be? Even if you appreciated the ""artistry"" of the first two films in the series, this one has not thing one to do with them (Ivy appears here only briefly, and in flashback, as a nine-year-old), and as an erotic thriller, well... either that's the toughest genre in the world to do correctly, or America has simply forgotten how to do it at all. And here's yet another example of that.Plot: do you really need one? Violet (Pressly, an Emmy winner for My Name Is Earl) is Ivy's sister, and at the beginning of the movie, when they're pre-teens, it's discovered that their mom, the housekeeper for a wealthy family, is having an affair with the poolboy. Why this gets everyone up in arms I have no idea, but she and her kids are tossed out on their ears. Fast-forward ten years, and Violet is back, supposedly looking for a place to stay while working at a local chain restaurant for the summer, trying to save for college. Joy (Tattoo, A Love Story's Megan Edwards), her old playmate, is overjoyed to see her, as is Joy's father Ivan (Mulholland Dr.'s Michael des Barres). The replacement housekeeper (the late, great Susan Tyrrell)... not so much. Needless to say, the housekeeper's right, and Violet has an ulterior motive......which involves lots of sex, not an inconsiderable amount of violence, and just plain silly overacting from everyone involved. But then, as I said before, you're not here for the acting. And you're certainly not here for the ridiculous script. You're here because, well, it's Jamie Pressly twenty years old and naked. * ",2,Ridiculous.,1366848000,"04 25, 2013",2013,1865,"['Poison', 'Ivy', '3', 'New', 'Seduction', 'Kurt', 'Voss', '1997', 'simple', 'only', 'reason', ""'re"", 'going', 'want', 'watch', 'Poison', 'Ivy', '3', 'want', 'watch', 'given', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Jamie', 'Pressly', 'one', 'earliest', 'roles', 'hot', 'hot', 'hot', 'mean', 'what', 'else', 'could', 'there', 'possibly', 'be', 'Even', 'appreciated', 'artistry', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'series', 'one', 'not', 'thing', 'one', 'do', 'Ivy', 'here', 'only', 'briefly', 'flashback', 'nine-year-old', 'erotic', 'thriller', 'well', 'toughest', 'genre', 'world', 'do', 'correctly', 'America', 'simply', 'forgotten', 'how', 'do', 'here', 'yet', 'example', 'that.Plot', 'do', 'really', 'need', 'one', 'Violet', 'Pressly', 'Emmy', 'winner', 'My', 'Name', 'Is', 'Earl', 'Ivy', 'sister', 'beginning', 'movie', 'when', ""'re"", 'pre-teens', 'discovered', 'mom', 'housekeeper', 'wealthy', 'family', 'having', 'affair', 'poolboy', 'Why', 'everyone', 'up', 'arms', 'have', 'idea', 'kids', 'are', 'tossed', 'out', 'ears', 'Fast-forward', 'ten', 'years', 'Violet', 'back', 'supposedly', 'looking', 'place', 'stay', 'working', 'local', 'chain', 'restaurant', 'summer', 'trying', 'save', 'college', 'Joy', 'Tattoo', 'A', 'Love', 'Story', 'Megan', 'Edwards', 'old', 'playmate', 'overjoyed', 'see', 'Joy', 'father', 'Ivan', 'Mulholland', 'Dr.', 'Michael', 'des', 'Barres', 'replacement', 'housekeeper', 'late', 'great', 'Susan', 'Tyrrell', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Needless', 'say', 'housekeeper', 'right', 'Violet', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'lots', 'sex', 'not', 'inconsiderable', 'amount', 'violence', 'just', 'plain', 'silly', 'overacting', 'everyone', 'involved', 'then', 'said', ""'re"", 'not', 'here', 'acting', ""'re"", 'certainly', 'not', 'here', 'ridiculous', 'script', ""'re"", 'here', 'well', 'Jamie', 'Pressly', 'twenty', 'years', 'old', 'naked', '*']",N/A
