503471,A2O0CFU9Q9XK3,B00000ID1E,"""madnessmark""","[2, 3]","If you put Rurouni Kenshin, Tenchi Muyo, Blue Seed and Ranma 1\2 together you who'd come up with this. The story follows Linn, a girl who has been training in Kyoto, who is trying to find her brother in Tokyo. She is soon in danger when rival syndicates that have the power of special creatures in their power try to stop her and the women who is protecting Linn. The head at all this is a chuby nerd. At first, this guy is Linn's enemy, but (like in Blue Seed) Linn soon takes an interest in Linn. This series isn't a hentai, but it does come pretty close to it with the women spending more than half the show with their clothes off. But this anime has everything. Political compition between sydicates, super powered warriors, samurai style action, bethroom and spa humor. Oh, and you know how anime character's nose bleeds? Well, lets just say the guy who's in love with Linn spouts blood like a fountain. The nudity is on a level of Ranma 1\2 and Tenchi Muyo. Thankfuly, the nudity isn't as gross as Photon (Ick!) and nor is there any sick seductions (atleast fully achieved) like in Maze. You should be aware that this is not an anime title for those who dislike nudity in their anime. This is for those who liked watching Those Who Hunt Elves and Ranma 1\2. By all means, by the subtitled version. The dubbed version can't match up to how well this anime is done. Now lets talk about the show: After Linn goes home with her guardian, she goes and takes a bath. However, that chuby nerd and his own personally made clone of Linn's guardian have other plans. After the clone comes in and ties the real guardian up in green stuff, she goes into the bathroom and gets in the bath with Linn. The clone tries to drown her, but Linn isn't that helpless. A brilliant battle ensues and even more stuff happens as a special super powered human from the syndicate to wipe out both the nerd and Linn. Linn ends up giving the assassian a brutal beating and she gets away. In the next episode, Linn and her guardian go to a spa where they happen to meet the nerd again. This episode discusses more of Linn's relationship to the nerd, which is knida sweet until the same thing happens as the last episode, except this time, the nerd is the victim. A clone of Linn seduces the guy and then Linn fights her again. Pretty sweet. The music is old style Japanese. Overall, this might not be for everyone so rent it first and see if you are one of the many people that enjoy this.",5,Everything you could want in an anime.,979862400,"01 19, 2001",2001,2465,"['put', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Blue', 'Seed', 'Ranma', '1\\2', 'together', 'who', ""'d"", 'come', 'up', 'story', 'Linn', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'training', 'Kyoto', 'who', 'trying', 'find', 'brother', 'Tokyo', 'soon', 'danger', 'when', 'rival', 'have', 'power', 'special', 'creatures', 'power', 'try', 'stop', 'women', 'who', 'protecting', 'Linn', 'head', 'chuby', 'nerd', 'first', 'guy', 'Linn', 'enemy', 'Blue', 'Seed', 'Linn', 'soon', 'interest', 'Linn', 'series', ""n't"", 'hentai', 'come', 'pretty', 'close', 'women', 'spending', 'more', 'show', 'clothes', 'anime', 'everything', 'Political', 'compition', 'sydicates', 'super', 'powered', 'warriors', 'samurai', 'style', 'action', 'bethroom', 'spa', 'humor', 'Oh', 'know', 'how', 'anime', 'character', 'nose', 'bleeds', 'Well', 'just', 'say', 'guy', 'who', 'love', 'Linn', 'spouts', 'blood', 'fountain', 'nudity', 'level', 'Ranma', '1\\2', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Thankfuly', 'nudity', ""n't"", 'as', 'gross', 'Photon', 'Ick', 'there', 'sick', 'seductions', 'fully', 'achieved', 'Maze', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'not', 'anime', 'title', 'who', 'dislike', 'nudity', 'anime', 'who', 'liked', 'watching', 'Who', 'Hunt', 'Elves', 'Ranma', '1\\2', 'means', 'subtitled', 'version', 'dubbed', 'version', 'ca', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'how', 'well', 'anime', 'done', 'Now', 'talk', 'show', 'Linn', 'home', 'guardian', 'bath', 'However', 'chuby', 'nerd', 'own', 'personally', 'made', 'clone', 'Linn', 'guardian', 'have', 'other', 'plans', 'clone', 'real', 'guardian', 'up', 'green', 'stuff', 'bathroom', 'bath', 'Linn', 'clone', 'drown', 'Linn', ""n't"", 'helpless', 'brilliant', 'battle', 'ensues', 'even', 'more', 'stuff', 'special', 'super', 'powered', 'human', 'syndicate', 'wipe', 'out', 'nerd', 'Linn', 'Linn', 'up', 'giving', 'assassian', 'brutal', 'beating', 'away', 'next', 'episode', 'Linn', 'guardian', 'go', 'spa', 'where', 'happen', 'meet', 'nerd', 'again', 'episode', 'more', 'Linn', 'relationship', 'nerd', 'knida', 'sweet', 'same', 'thing', 'last', 'episode', 'time', 'nerd', 'victim', 'clone', 'Linn', 'guy', 'then', 'Linn', 'again', 'Pretty', 'sweet', 'music', 'old', 'style', 'Japanese', 'Overall', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'so', 'rent', 'first', 'see', 'are', 'one', 'many', 'people', 'enjoy']",Adventures of Kotetsu VHS

The Adventures of Kotetsu is based on the Manga by the same name, wich I have never read. This two episode series was obviously supposed to be longer, but must not have done well when aired in Japan and was discontinued, so that is why there are characters in the opening theme that never appeared in the Anime but did in the Manga. This has some perverted jokes in it and about 1/5 of the entire thing is naked girls so parents be warned. However, kotetsu is pretty funny. The first time I saw It i enjoyed it but did not love it. But, like many other Anime, it is much better the second time. I can't say anything for the dub, but the Japanese is fine. The only reson I have not yet bought this is that I'm waiting for it to come out on DVD. ADV says that they will be releasing all their titles on DVD but, of course, the most popular take priority, so it's just a matter of time.

So now I'll give this anime title a review from a lady's perspective.  The story is obviously based on  manga by some perverted, geek and with this being the case there is very  little story presented, but plenty of time is focused on the female  characters being undressed in a tasteless manner.The first part to  this tape is about an adolescent girl named Linn who runs way from her  sensei's home in search of her older brother.  Linn's search takes her to  the city of Tokyo, specifically to the Kuon Detective Agency.  While at  this agency Linn meets a woman detective named Miho Kuon who decides to  take Linn to her home.  Little do the two know that Miho is being watched  and followed by a pervert named Tetsuya Mikado.  Tetsuya creates a clone of  Miho who gets into the bathtub with Linn, makes advances towards her, and  then tries to drown her.  Linn ends up fighting the nude, Miho clone  outside.  Tetsuya is watching of course, and Linn ends up dropping her  towel in front of him.In the second part of the OAV, Linn and Miho  decide to go to the Hot Springs.  Naturally, Tetsuya just happens to be  there to see Linn naked. Also an evil woman impersonating Linn decides to  get in the Hot Spring nude with Tetsuya and proceeds to try and seduce  him.So if you enjoy anime that focuses on gratuitous female nudity,  with a perverted male character playing the leading man, and enjoy anime  that's littered with silliness than this is the movie for you.",1,The Bare Facts,951264000,"02 23, 2000",2000,1586,"['Clearly', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'reviewed', 'OAV', 'title', 'had', 'chance', 'have', 'X', 'Y', 'chromosome', 'So', 'now', ""'ll"", 'give', 'anime', 'title', 'review', 'lady', 'perspective', 'story', 'obviously', 'based', 'manga', 'perverted', 'geek', 'being', 'case', 'very', 'little', 'story', 'presented', 'plenty', 'time', 'focused', 'female', 'characters', 'being', 'undressed', 'tasteless', 'manner.The', 'first', 'part', 'tape', 'adolescent', 'girl', 'named', 'Linn', 'who', 'way', 'sensei', 'home', 'search', 'older', 'brother', 'Linn', 'search', 'city', 'Tokyo', 'specifically', 'Kuon', 'Detective', 'Agency', 'agency', 'Linn', 'woman', 'detective', 'named', 'Miho', 'Kuon', 'who', 'take', 'Linn', 'home', 'Little', 'do', 'two', 'know', 'Miho', 'being', 'watched', 'followed', 'pervert', 'named', 'Tetsuya', 'Mikado', 'Tetsuya', 'clone', 'Miho', 'who', 'bathtub', 'Linn', 'advances', 'then', 'tries', 'drown', 'Linn', 'up', 'fighting', 'nude', 'Miho', 'clone', 'outside', 'Tetsuya', 'watching', 'course', 'Linn', 'up', 'dropping', 'towel', 'front', 'second', 'part', 'OAV', 'Linn', 'Miho', 'decide', 'go', 'Hot', 'Springs', 'Naturally', 'Tetsuya', 'just', 'be', 'there', 'see', 'Linn', 'naked', 'Also', 'evil', 'woman', 'impersonating', 'Linn', 'get', 'Hot', 'Spring', 'nude', 'Tetsuya', 'proceeds', 'try', 'seduce', 'him.So', 'enjoy', 'anime', 'gratuitous', 'female', 'nudity', 'perverted', 'male', 'character', 'playing', 'leading', 'man', 'enjoy', 'anime', 'littered', 'silliness', 'movie']",Adventures of Kotetsu VHS

First off, the opening theme and entire soundtrack is done with more of an 'ancient ' Japan feel that uses voice but not words as an instrument. That turned out to be far better than I'd expected. There's also a lot of perverted humor and nudity. The fight scenes are pretty cool, but always end in a Japanese-style duel in which the victor is always obvious. Some of the plot points are awkward, such as the mentioning of characters that never actually appear in the story. Kotetsu's mistress apparently transforms into a much younger woman for most of the story, but the fact that she actually did transform is only slightly hinted at. Readers of the manga would be able to understand a few parts better, but those unfamiliar with it should be able to enjoy the anime anyway.

503476,A342YXQN4DLHL3,B00000ID1E,Yui Hongo,"[2, 3]","I rated the dubbed version of this anime some time ago, but seeing that so many people painted such an inaccurate picture of this OVA I decided to also rate the subtitled version.This OVA is about some girl who along with a woman detective get to be exploited and objectified all on one, convent, little tape *s*. What about the story? It's full of many repetitive elements: For instance an ugly, dorky, perverted guy gets his jollies by either looking up someone's skirt or being in the appropriate location to see the leading female characters constantly without their clothes on which offends me. The thing that makes it worse is the fact that one of the girls who are objectified in this OVA can't be any older than thirteen. I find that to be really disturbing even though she's just a cartoon character, because of what she represents (which is nothing more than a mere child) and the way her body is used in a sexual manner throughout the entire OVA even in the opening. It makes me really wonder about the creator, he must be one sick old man. Also this movie wasn't funny in the least.
