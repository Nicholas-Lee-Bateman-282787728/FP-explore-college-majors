The underlying concept is that some children are lost to worlds in other dimensions. Occasionally they come back with strange abilities and they are then schooled separately from the rest of the world. The central character is called Akatsuki Ousawa who is a classic rogue/jester figure is one such figure. He travels to and from a world called Alayzard where he has killed a dark king and kidnapped his daughter (Miu). The rest of the plot concerns how these two survive in the school system, making friends and enemies along the way until a figure from Alayzard arrives to spoil the party.

He was summoned to a magical world in which he made a name for himself as the Rogue Hero by defeating the last Dark Lord.  Now back on Earth, he brought back a little momento from the other side, the daughter of said Dark Lord, Myuu.  Now the two of them enter the school of Babel, with her as his sister,  so they can learn to control their abilites and perhaps live a normal life.  But there are people on both sides who want to put an end to not only the Rogue Hero, but to end Myuu as well.  Can Atkaski give Myuu the life he knows she deserves, or is will someone tear them apart?This was a great series.  Despite Atkaki's perverted manner (taking the student council VP's underwear in the middle of the school, to fondiling Myuu in the middle of the ocean), you can see that he truly cares for others, especially Myuu who he has sworn to protect and wants to see her be happy.  Myuu is a running gag with her over developed chest that just pops out at the most unusualy times, to the development of the other main characters.

I read through the reviews to garner more opinions and finally decided on purchasing this anime.It IS action/adv/fantasy. However there is an insane amount of gratuitous nudity that was wholly not what I was prepared for. I probably should have been more thorough on my research when deciding to purchase this show. I mostly bought it because of the genre and the fact that the series had an amazing voice cast.The plot was ok. However, I prefer something a little more meaty; no pun intended. The animation was very well done and as I mentioned before the voice cast is stellar.
