1660161,A3DQBSA9YPD8GZ,B00DOZNIVG,Doug,"[0, 0]","The product, quality, price and packaging is excellent.  The series itself stars Richard Carlson as on of the commanding officer of a cavalry detachment in the Old West.  They are secretly authorized to cross the border with Mexico and pursue bandits, criminals and renegade Indians.  I love old black and white western series, but Richard Carlson's character reminds me of all of the overbearing and self-righteous bosses I ever had.  His role really is really a know it all hero who somehow never loses.  Add to that the fact he has virtually zero cast interaction, banter or support.  A bizarre thing is their mission is top secret but they wear their uniforms when crossing into Mexico.  The early 1950's narration is used in every episode too which I can take or leave.  Good to see early shows, but this might be the first black and white western I did not like.",3,It's OK,1400976000,"05 25, 2014",2014,868,"['product', 'quality', 'price', 'packaging', 'excellent', 'series', 'Richard', 'Carlson', 'commanding', 'officer', 'cavalry', 'detachment', 'Old', 'West', 'are', 'secretly', 'authorized', 'cross', 'border', 'Mexico', 'pursue', 'bandits', 'criminals', 'renegade', 'Indians', 'love', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'western', 'series', 'Richard', 'Carlson', 'character', 'overbearing', 'self-righteous', 'bosses', 'ever', 'had', 'role', 'really', 'really', 'know', 'hero', 'who', 'somehow', 'never', 'Add', 'fact', 'virtually', 'zero', 'cast', 'interaction', 'banter', 'support', 'bizarre', 'thing', 'mission', 'top', 'secret', 'wear', 'uniforms', 'when', 'crossing', 'Mexico', 'early', '1950', 'narration', 'used', 'episode', 'too', 'can', 'take', 'leave', 'Good', 'see', 'early', 'shows', 'might', 'be', 'first', 'black', 'white', 'western', 'did', 'not']",Mackenzie's Raiders: The TV Series

Richard Carlson is really good as the the intrepid Lt Col Ranald McKenzie of the 4th US Cavalry.  In each episode, he leads his command in pursuit of savage Indians or Mexican bandits.  Most times, they have to cross the border into Mexico to accomplish the mission.  Lt Col Mckenzie had secret orders to cross the border, but if caught or killed the US government would disavow any knowledge of his activities.  Kind of like a western Mission: Impossible. The series featured a lot of action, hard riding, and good stories, all packed into 30 minutes episodes.

1660164,A9VKQ86LSG5AA,B00DOZNIVG,leon eon,"[33, 33]","Ziv produced many 50's classic syndicated shows like Sea Hunt, Bat Masterson, I Led 3 Lives and Tombstone Territory. Mackenzies Raiders ran for only one season, unlike the others mentioned, and therefore with only 39 episodes produced disappeared from &#34;re-run heaven&#34; until this release. Colonel Mackenzie, played by Richard Carlson, is a very strong willed man, similar to Marshal Dillon. The &#34;raiders&#34; are his group of soldiers who are forbidden from crossing the Rio Grande despite regular attacks from renegade Indians and Outlaws. If caught, Mackenzie and his raiders would face a court martial. This premise would re-appear in the 60's in Mission Impossible, obviously to a greater degree of TV success. However, do not dismiss this show as the quality of scripts and acting is top notch. On a scale of 1-10 it would be rated by myself as a 8/9. I have no idea why it was only on for one season, perhaps Ziv was overloaded with all the other series it was producing, but lost as it may have been it is here now and I urge anyone to check it out!Timeless has released so many great 50's oaters like Restless Gun/ The Texan/ Destry/ Riverboat/ Tales of Wells Fargo and Tombstone Territory.

Around that time I always purchased copies of TRUE WEST, FRONTIER TIMES and REAL WEST magazines from the local drugstore (along with comics and monster magazines) and those magazines were often featuring stories/articles about Col. Ranald Mackenzie and his raiders and I remember just sucking it all in, as this was my favorite television show for at least a year or so.Now, my recall of actual episodes is non-existent but the images remained alive as I popped in the dvd and enjoyed. Richard Carlson was more memorable to me for his sci-fi/horror movies and I had forgotten that he headlined the series as Mackenzie. I won't go into plot detail for the series except to state as others before have that this series looks just FANTASTIC, crisp and clear, and that you should buy this product without hesitation. I wasn't even sure that I needed to chime in anything about this series, except that...The first episode reminded me a lot of Sam Peckinpah's feature MAJOR DUNDEE, in which a troop of cavalry illegally crosses the Rio Grande and carries out their agenda with no government backing.
