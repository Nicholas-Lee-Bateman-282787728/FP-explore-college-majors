795046,ATB7BNFP1P1S3,B00018D40O,Age Of The Wheel,"[0, 1]","I've just re-ordered this movie for the second time, which accurately describes my opinions of it.Faulted?  Yes.  And for all the reasons listed by other viewers: scenes that don't work, or highly-improbable dialogue.  My guess is that, like all movies, you can only re-shoot scenes so many times, and that, ultimately, the cast and crew were fighting time and or financial restraints.  But when it works, it works very, very well.I read the first RIPLEY novel after seeing the Matt Damon movie, and the tone of the movie, while finely done, is not quite the same as the book.  I've heard a lot of young people say that they didn't ""get"" the Damon movie, and here is my theory as to why: the novel was written in the early 1950's, when wealthy Americans lived in a world unto themselves, and society tossed homosexuals into mental institutions for doses of electro-shock therapy.  An early scene from the first RIPLEY novel has Ripley's aunt---whom he lives with, and who mocks him for being a sissy---pretending to drive away from him in order to get a cheap laugh; later on, when the reader discovers that Ripley has been a con artist for a long, long time, you understand that the origins of this were neither ""accidental"" (like the movie), or, done purely for sadistic entertainment.  There truly is a strong survival element going on here.If you want to blame anybody for this movie's rough spots, then you might start with the author herself, who turned RIPLEY into a bisexual in the novel version of RIPLEY'S GAME, which was written 20 years after the first RIPLEY novel (I've not read RIPLEY'S GAME myself, so I can't confirm that).  For me, a heterosexual, that was the most difficult improbability to accept (and had me groaning that hopeless, ""Aw geez, this is one of those movies that won't ever get remade again so we're stuck with it"" refrain).  Very obviously, the Pianist should have been a male in his twenties (would have contributed to the movie in so many other ways and scenes).",4,A faulted piece...,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",2013,1999,"[""'ve"", 'just', 're-ordered', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'accurately', 'opinions', 'it.Faulted', 'Yes', 'reasons', 'listed', 'other', 'viewers', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'highly-improbable', 'dialogue', 'guess', 'movies', 'can', 'only', 're-shoot', 'scenes', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'ultimately', 'cast', 'crew', 'were', 'fighting', 'time', 'financial', 'restraints', 'when', 'very', 'very', 'well.I', 'read', 'first', 'RIPLEY', 'novel', 'seeing', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'movie', 'tone', 'movie', 'finely', 'done', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'book', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'lot', 'young', 'people', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Damon', 'movie', 'here', 'theory', 'why', 'novel', 'was', 'written', 'early', '1950', 'when', 'wealthy', 'Americans', 'lived', 'world', 'unto', 'society', 'tossed', 'homosexuals', 'mental', 'institutions', 'doses', 'electro-shock', 'therapy', 'early', 'scene', 'first', 'RIPLEY', 'novel', 'Ripley', 'aunt', 'who', 'being', 'sissy', '-pretending', 'drive', 'away', 'order', 'get', 'cheap', 'laugh', 'later', 'when', 'reader', 'Ripley', 'been', 'con', 'artist', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'understand', 'origins', 'were', 'accidental', 'movie', 'done', 'purely', 'sadistic', 'entertainment', 'truly', 'strong', 'survival', 'element', 'going', 'here.If', 'want', 'blame', 'anybody', 'movie', 'rough', 'spots', 'then', 'might', 'start', 'author', 'who', 'turned', 'RIPLEY', 'bisexual', 'novel', 'version', 'RIPLEY', 'GAME', 'was', 'written', '20', 'years', 'first', 'RIPLEY', 'novel', ""'ve"", 'not', 'read', 'RIPLEY', 'GAME', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'confirm', 'heterosexual', 'was', 'most', 'difficult', 'improbability', 'accept', 'had', 'groaning', 'hopeless', 'Aw', 'geez', 'one', 'movies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'get', 'remade', 'again', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'refrain', 'Very', 'obviously', 'Pianist', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'male', 'twenties', 'would', 'have', 'contributed', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'ways', 'scenes']",Ripley's Game

I loved all three, including the countless differences between them, and I have found Tom Ripley's character immensely fascinating and, in a way even inspiring, though quite a bit chilling as well. I understand this movie - ""Ripley's Game"" - was also based on a novel by Highsmith, one of the later in the series. This I haven't read. But I do hope it's FAR better than the screenplay.It goes without saying that John Malkovich is a fine actor who would make a terrific Tom Ripley. If only he had a fine script to work on! The story here is perfectly idiotic; a five-year-old kid wouldn't buy such illogicality. With the possible exception of Malkovich, the acting is hilariously inept. Who was this cruel person who lied to Dougray Scott that he could act at all?The only thing this movie counts on is shock value. This it has. All murders - and there are many of them - are shown is the most graphic manner possible, including a lovely scene of garotting. So there is a good deal of pancake syrup around and the audience, provided that it's mentally deficient, is happy. For the sophisticated who are keen on higher pleasures, there are a few very steamy scenes.All in all, a stupendously dull and worthless movie: stupid story, weak acting, lots of unnecessary blood and gore.

795049,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00018D40O,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","When comparing `Ripley's Game' to Wim Wenders' `Der Amerikanische Freund' there are a few things the audience notices.  First, Cavani's `Game' is a much glitzier, glossier piece than Wenders' `Freund'.  The plot is less confusing, much easier to follow than Wenders' original (which had me asking all sorts of unanswered questions in the end) but in a downswing `Game' looses some of the unnerving terror that Wenders created with `Freund'.  Despite not understanding what was going on at times, I never felt anything but on edge throughout `Der Amerikanische Freund', whereas with `Ripley's Game' my interest waned a tad in scenes.Sadly, both films fail in one similar area; Tom Ripley.  I don't know if maybe I've just been spoiled by Matt Damon's orgasmic portrayal of the twisted psychopath in the far superior `The Talented Mr. Ripley' but neither Hopper nor Malkovich have been able to impress me.  Malkovich has a little more charm and polish than Hopper had, but he is far too brash for me to appreciate his madness (and I really need to read the novel because `The Talented Mr. Ripley' made it very clear that his interests were towards men, not women).  Their concept of Ripley comes off more studied and clich&eacute;d, as if they took everything we think someone of their nature would be like and then just give it to us `textbook'.  Damon was a stark contrast to this, giving us an awkward, gullible man who fell in love too fast and trusted too much and gave way to his insanely carnal desires at the expense of others.  Malkovich and Hopper come off a little too confident.  I know that Ripley is supposed to be older and wiser in this film (and `Der Amerikanische Freund' as well) but I can't help but feel negatively towards the depiction of him in the two films.  Damon's character was ruthless in the end but he possessed this natural awkwardness that made him likable.  I don't see any likable traits in Ripley in either of these films.  Why anyone would warm up to him is beyond me.When the film started the first thing I noticed was that Dougray Scott was in this film.  What ever happened to this guy?  He was charming in `Ever After' and domineering and sinister in `MI:2' and then he just disappeared.  Here he is a bit of a let down, giving the audience a clich&eacute;d impression of grief and guilt.  Bruno Ganz was brilliant in `Der Amerikanische Freund' and I wanted Scott to be as well.  In fact it wasn't until the final scenes where I saw some real, honest emotion from his character (most notably while he sits in the car watching Ripley set another car ablaze).The best thing about this movie, by far, is Ray Winstone.  His performance is electric, commanding and dominating.  He is an actor I am eternally smitten (his performance in `The Proposition' is the work of gods) and here he continues to prove me right about him.  Winstone has this natural charm and charisma that draws you to him, even when he's playing scum.  I can't help but he culled into his voice those beady eyes.  As Reeves, he plays the gangster role with exquisite precision, creating a supporting character that is carries this film on its shoulders.One thing I didn't enjoy was the omission of the subway murder scene that is so etched in my mind from `Der Amerikanische Freund'.  This time the murder scene takes place in an insect exhibit and is short and bland.  I remember standing in front of the TV during the subway scene in `Der Amerikanische Freund', watching Ganz walked aimlessly, following his victim, stalking him, for minutes that passed so slowly, so anxiously.  That scene is flawless.  It's not here and I found myself feeling empty after I realized that.In the end `Ripley's Game' is a decent thriller that has some chills and a nice steady flow, but it never reaches the levels that both `Der Amerikanische Freund' and especially `The Talented Mr. Ripley' had achieved.  Winstone is a gem of an actor and his performance makes this film worth watching.  Malkovich is fine, as is Dougray, but neither of them match the brilliance of the actors that came before them (Damon and Ganz respectively).  Give it a watch, especially if you are a fan of Highsmith and or the `Ripley' series.  It is far from a bad film, it is just not a great one.",3,A decent thriller that fails to live up to its potential...,1210291200,"05 9, 2008",2008,4267,"['When', 'comparing', 'Ripley', 'Game', 'Wim', 'Wenders', 'Der', 'Amerikanische', 'Freund', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'audience', 'notices', 'First', 'Cavani', 'Game', 'much', 'glitzier', 'glossier', 'piece', 'Wenders', 'Freund', 'plot', 'less', 'confusing', 'much', 'easier', 'follow', 'Wenders', 'original', 'had', 'asking', 'sorts', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'end', 'downswing', 'Game', 'unnerving', 'terror', 'Wenders', 'created', 'Freund', 'not', 'understanding', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'times', 'never', 'felt', 'anything', 'edge', 'Der', 'Amerikanische', 'Freund', 'whereas', 'Ripley', 'Game', 'interest', 'waned', 'tad', 'scenes.Sadly', 'films', 'fail', 'one', 'similar', 'area', 'Tom', 'Ripley', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'just', 'been', 'spoiled', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'orgasmic', 'portrayal', 'twisted', 'psychopath', 'far', 'superior', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'Hopper', 'Malkovich', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'impress', 'Malkovich', 'little', 'more', 'charm', 'polish', 'Hopper', 'had', 'far', 'too', 'brash', 'appreciate', 'madness', 'really', 'need', 'read', 'novel', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'made', 'very', 'clear', 'interests', 'were', 'towards', 'men', 'not', 'women', 'concept', 'Ripley', 'off', 'more', 'studied', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'took', 'everything', 'think', 'someone', 'nature', 'would', 'be', 'then', 'just', 'give', 'textbook', 'Damon', 'was', 'stark', 'contrast', 'giving', 'awkward', 'gullible', 'man', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'too', 'fast', 'trusted', 'too', 'much', 'gave', 'way', 'insanely', 'carnal', 'desires', 'expense', 'others', 'Malkovich', 'Hopper', 'come', 'off', 'little', 'too', 'confident', 'know', 'Ripley', 'supposed', 'be', 'older', 'wiser', 'film', 'Der', 'Amerikanische', 'Freund', 'as', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'negatively', 'depiction', 'two', 'films', 'Damon', 'character', 'was', 'ruthless', 'end', 'possessed', 'natural', 'awkwardness', 'made', 'likable', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'likable', 'traits', 'Ripley', 'films', 'Why', 'anyone', 'would', 'warm', 'up', 'me.When', 'film', 'started', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'was', 'film', 'What', 'ever', 'happened', 'guy', 'was', 'charming', 'Ever', 'domineering', 'sinister', 'MI:2', 'then', 'just', 'disappeared', 'Here', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'giving', 'audience', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'impression', 'grief', 'guilt', 'Bruno', 'Ganz', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Der', 'Amerikanische', 'Freund', 'wanted', 'Scott', 'be', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'final', 'scenes', 'where', 'saw', 'real', 'honest', 'emotion', 'character', 'most', 'notably', 'car', 'watching', 'Ripley', 'set', 'car', 'ablaze', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'far', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'performance', 'electric', 'commanding', 'dominating', 'actor', 'am', 'eternally', 'smitten', 'performance', 'Proposition', 'work', 'gods', 'here', 'prove', 'right', 'Winstone', 'natural', 'charm', 'charisma', 'even', 'when', 'playing', 'scum', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'culled', 'voice', 'beady', 'eyes', 'Reeves', 'gangster', 'role', 'exquisite', 'precision', 'creating', 'supporting', 'character', 'film', 'shoulders.One', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'was', 'omission', 'subway', 'murder', 'scene', 'so', 'etched', 'mind', 'Der', 'Amerikanische', 'Freund', 'time', 'murder', 'scene', 'place', 'insect', 'exhibit', 'short', 'bland', 'remember', 'standing', 'front', 'TV', 'subway', 'scene', 'Der', 'Amerikanische', 'Freund', 'watching', 'Ganz', 'walked', 'aimlessly', 'following', 'victim', 'stalking', 'minutes', 'passed', 'so', 'slowly', 'so', 'anxiously', 'scene', 'flawless', 'not', 'here', 'found', 'feeling', 'empty', 'realized', 'that.In', 'end', 'Ripley', 'Game', 'decent', 'thriller', 'chills', 'nice', 'steady', 'flow', 'never', 'levels', 'Der', 'Amerikanische', 'Freund', 'especially', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'had', 'achieved', 'Winstone', 'gem', 'actor', 'performance', 'film', 'watching', 'Malkovich', 'fine', 'Dougray', 'match', 'brilliance', 'actors', 'came', 'Damon', 'Ganz', 'respectively', 'Give', 'watch', 'especially', 'are', 'fan', 'Highsmith', 'Ripley', 'series', 'far', 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'one']",Ripley's Game

795053,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00018D40O,C. B Collins Jr.,"[3, 4]","Patricia Highsmith, who wrote Ripley's Game, thought that any human was capable of murder given the right set of circumstances. Thus her book, Ripley's Game, puts her theory to the test. This excellent film version is very well done, primiarily by maintaining focus on the central theme that Highsmith wished to explore and not getting caught in Hollywood special effects and gory details.In this film, we have the wonderful Highsmith creation, Tom Ripley, the young man who finds that he is a complete sociopath and then finds complete enjoyment in acting upon his homicidal impulses.  Ripley is an interesting character. He is a highly refined and intelligent sociopath. Thus he is able to maintain an ice cool philosophical view of the murders he commits. He asks whether the world is worse off or change by the murders he commits and decides that human life is worth very little in the larger cosmic picture. He has no guilt, no remorse, only morbid curiosity and a desire to live a life of composure among art treasures, Tuscan palaces, antiquities, exquisite gardens, and a beautiful and talented lover.In this film, Ripley is contrasted with an Italian picture framer who is a young husband and father slowly dying from leukemia. This young man makes the mistake of insulting Ripley at a neighborhood cocktail party and sets the stage to become a play-thing in Ripley's games of murder. This is the test of Highsmith's theory that anyone can be a murderer given the right set of circumstances. Ripley finds that the young man is dying and that he is concerned for the financial support of his young wife and child after he is gone. Ripley then involves they fellow in  series of well paid assassintations.John Malkvich is excellent at playing Tom Ripley, very cool and sophisticated in his homicidal mode. Dougray Scott is excellent as the young father, pushed into extreme circumstances. Yet there is a price and consequences for anyone who leads a normal life and then commits a terrible crime. Dougray Scott's character pays far more that his journey than he every expects. He may be good at murder but he is not good at hiding himself from his wife.The film is entertaining and beautifully filmed in the Italian countryside.",4,A perfect test of Highsmith's theory,1184716800,"07 18, 2007",2007,2235,"['Patricia', 'Highsmith', 'who', 'wrote', 'Ripley', 'Game', 'thought', 'human', 'was', 'capable', 'murder', 'given', 'right', 'set', 'circumstances', 'Thus', 'book', 'Ripley', 'Game', 'theory', 'test', 'excellent', 'film', 'version', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'primiarily', 'maintaining', 'focus', 'central', 'theme', 'Highsmith', 'wished', 'explore', 'not', 'getting', 'caught', 'Hollywood', 'special', 'effects', 'gory', 'details.In', 'film', 'have', 'wonderful', 'Highsmith', 'creation', 'Tom', 'Ripley', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'complete', 'sociopath', 'then', 'complete', 'enjoyment', 'acting', 'homicidal', 'impulses', 'Ripley', 'interesting', 'character', 'highly', 'refined', 'intelligent', 'sociopath', 'Thus', 'able', 'maintain', 'ice', 'cool', 'philosophical', 'view', 'murders', 'world', 'worse', 'change', 'murders', 'human', 'life', 'worth', 'very', 'little', 'larger', 'cosmic', 'picture', 'guilt', 'remorse', 'only', 'morbid', 'curiosity', 'desire', 'live', 'life', 'composure', 'art', 'treasures', 'Tuscan', 'palaces', 'antiquities', 'exquisite', 'gardens', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'lover.In', 'film', 'Ripley', 'contrasted', 'Italian', 'picture', 'framer', 'who', 'young', 'husband', 'father', 'slowly', 'dying', 'leukemia', 'young', 'man', 'mistake', 'insulting', 'Ripley', 'neighborhood', 'cocktail', 'party', 'stage', 'become', 'play-thing', 'Ripley', 'games', 'murder', 'test', 'Highsmith', 'theory', 'anyone', 'can', 'be', 'murderer', 'given', 'right', 'set', 'circumstances', 'Ripley', 'young', 'man', 'dying', 'concerned', 'financial', 'support', 'young', 'wife', 'child', 'gone', 'Ripley', 'then', 'fellow', 'series', 'well', 'paid', 'assassintations.John', 'Malkvich', 'excellent', 'playing', 'Tom', 'Ripley', 'very', 'cool', 'sophisticated', 'homicidal', 'mode', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'excellent', 'young', 'father', 'pushed', 'extreme', 'circumstances', 'price', 'consequences', 'anyone', 'who', 'normal', 'life', 'then', 'terrible', 'crime', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'character', 'far', 'more', 'journey', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'murder', 'not', 'good', 'hiding', 'wife.The', 'film', 'entertaining', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'Italian', 'countryside']",Ripley's Game
795054,A2QZQBINBG6B5N,B00018D40O,Charles S. Houser,"[42, 45]","Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley is a true sociopath and Malkovich plays him chillingly. Although I had trouble understanding the basic scam that seems to be driving the plot of this movie, I have a hunch it is not really significant anyway. The movie seems to be primarily a metaphor for modern (postmodern?) life and the seduction of an honest (but weak and dying) man by evil. Dougray Scott plays the ""innocent"" party. His moral struggle and agony is constantly displayed on his face. It is hard to imagine how he as an actor could produce all this intense emotion when he is getting nothing but deadpan understatement from Malkovich. But their partnership on the screen is truly eerie. And the stony coldness of the Berlin setting (with its unforgetable associations with nazi evil) only adds to the general atmosphere of creepiness. Although I don't know if his line comes from Highsmith's novel, it does seem consistent with the existential aura in which she casts her killers to have Scott's character (at his most distraught) ask Ripley, ""Why me? Why did you choose me?"" Ripley's answer would have done Camus proud.It's hard to picture Malkovich as the elder version of Matt Damon's Ripley (from The Talented Mr. Ripley). There is no sense of Ripley as the romantically disappointed lost soul committing murders in spite of his earnest desire to be socially accepted. Malkovich ""thrives"" socially--has a wife (or lover), and even enjoys harpsicord music. It's just not clear what he ""gets"" from all his success.

795056,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B00018D40O,C. Middleton,"[7, 7]","Tom Ripley re-emerges once again after twenty years. His character has matured - he is a man of means and taste, living with a young and beautiful Italian harpsichordist in a lavish mansion, filled with classical art and tasteful objects -a man with a seething dark side, a willingness to remove anyone who would get in his way. There is a cold sophistication about this man, a man who on the surface, appears as if he has reached a stage in human development above the rest of us mortals. He reminds me of Hannibal Lecter - extremely intelligent, arrogant though displays a high level of refinement. One pierces this thin faade, however, and discovers not a man at all, but a monster.John Malkovich as Tom Ripley was perfect casting. Malkovich seemed to have an uncanny insight into this character. There's no overacting, a melodramatic portrayal of a conscienceless killer, but a subtle performance, which captured the irony and restrained evil of such a man. What makes the character of Ripley so chilling is that sophisticated cold-bloodedness', the fact that he doesn't have a conscience, and has been aware of this deficit in his personality since childhood. The character actually mentions this fact in the film, and said that when he discovered this deficit in himself, it troubled him. But this is how he gets along in the world, and it works for him.One of Ripley's old colleagues looks him up in Italy to settle a past debt. The man wants someone killed, and needs a person outside the game to do the deed to maintain a safe distance. A neighbour of Ripley's made the mistake of insulting him in front of a group of people. This man is dieing of leukaemia and would be the perfect ""innocent"" to do the crime. Ripley, in his usual seductive and manipulative manner, sets it in motion, turning a dieing family man into a potential killer. How can a `normal' man learn to live with himself after committing a murder for hire? Can a man lose his conscience over time after committing a series of abominable acts? As Ripley says in the film, ""You know its funny, after doing a terrible thing, you tend to forget about it in a few days.""This film is a well-made thriller with a believable and compelling performance by John Malkovich. The first instalment ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" was indeed a good film in its own right, but this one, to my mind, surpasses it, in terms of style and performance.",5,Sophisticated cold-bloodedness...,1076976000,"02 17, 2004",2004,2402,"['Tom', 'Ripley', 're-emerges', 'once', 'again', 'twenty', 'years', 'character', 'matured', 'man', 'means', 'taste', 'living', 'young', 'beautiful', 'Italian', 'harpsichordist', 'lavish', 'mansion', 'filled', 'classical', 'art', 'tasteful', 'objects', '-a', 'man', 'seething', 'dark', 'side', 'willingness', 'remove', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'get', 'way', 'cold', 'sophistication', 'man', 'man', 'who', 'surface', 'reached', 'stage', 'human', 'development', 'rest', 'mortals', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'arrogant', 'displays', 'high', 'level', 'refinement', 'One', 'thin', 'faade', 'however', 'discovers', 'not', 'man', 'monster.John', 'Malkovich', 'Tom', 'Ripley', 'was', 'perfect', 'casting', 'Malkovich', 'seemed', 'have', 'uncanny', 'insight', 'character', 'overacting', 'melodramatic', 'portrayal', 'conscienceless', 'killer', 'subtle', 'performance', 'captured', 'irony', 'restrained', 'evil', 'such', 'man', 'What', 'character', 'Ripley', 'chilling', 'sophisticated', 'cold-bloodedness', 'fact', ""n't"", 'have', 'conscience', 'been', 'aware', 'deficit', 'personality', 'childhood', 'character', 'actually', 'fact', 'film', 'said', 'when', 'discovered', 'deficit', 'troubled', 'how', 'along', 'world', 'him.One', 'Ripley', 'old', 'colleagues', 'up', 'Italy', 'settle', 'past', 'debt', 'man', 'someone', 'killed', 'person', 'game', 'do', 'deed', 'maintain', 'safe', 'distance', 'neighbour', 'Ripley', 'made', 'mistake', 'insulting', 'front', 'group', 'people', 'man', 'dieing', 'leukaemia', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'innocent', 'do', 'crime', 'Ripley', 'usual', 'seductive', 'manipulative', 'manner', 'motion', 'turning', 'dieing', 'family', 'man', 'potential', 'killer', 'How', 'can', 'normal', 'man', 'learn', 'live', 'committing', 'murder', 'hire', 'Can', 'man', 'lose', 'conscience', 'time', 'committing', 'series', 'abominable', 'acts', 'Ripley', 'film', 'know', 'funny', 'doing', 'terrible', 'thing', 'tend', 'forget', 'few', 'days', 'film', 'well-made', 'thriller', 'believable', 'compelling', 'performance', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'first', 'instalment', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'was', 'indeed', 'good', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'one', 'mind', 'terms', 'style', 'performance']",Ripley's Game

DeRiemer,"[3, 4]","""Who are you?"" asks Jonathan Trevanny (Dougray Scott), who inadvertently insulted Tom Ripley several days ago, and now finds himself in a German train's lavatory with Ripley, two criminals Ripley has garroted and one Trevanny has shot.""I'm a creation,"" Ripley (John Malkovich) says. ""I'm a gifted improvisor. I lack your conscience. When I was young that troubled me. It no longer does. I don't worry about being caught because I don't believe anyone is watching. The world is not a poorer place because those people are dead. It's one less car in the road. It's a little less noise and menace.""Trevanny, an honest man, a British framer working in a small Italian town, has a wife and child he loves dearly. He also is dying of leukemia. He had invited his neighbor, Ripley, to a birthday party for his young son along with other neighbors and friends. Ripley had made a fortune three years earlier in a forgery scam that included Ripley's bashing to death a fellow who tried to intervene. Now Ripley lives in a large villa he has restored to tasteful grandeur. He shares his life with his young mistress, a talented pianist. He employs the best cook in the region. He prides himself on his taste. At the party he overhears Trevanny say to other neighbors that the trouble with Ripley is too much money and not enough taste. Ripley, an upwardly mobile sociopath, naturally enough resents this and decides to have a bit of fun.For Trevanny, desperate for money for his family when he dies, Ripley develops a scheme to turn him into an assassin...a person much like Ripley. Things go wrong when one of the victims in the lavatory survives. He and his associates go after Ripley and Trevanny, finally reaching them at Ripley's villa and then at Trevanny's home. The conclusion is violent, decisive and unsettling.This is a cool, almost dispassionate film. Ripley has his own code and it doesn't involve deep involvement with others. He can be moved to a degree by things that might be imagined as affection or even a kind of friendship, but woe to anyone who would stake his life on Ripley. Ripley is basically an observer who is moved to action only when it suits him. It has suited him to begin a game of corruption involving Trevanny. And Trevanny, for all his honesty and good intentions, is soon corrupted. He doesn't lose our sympathy; after all, he is in a terrible position, poor, with a family and dying. The two people he kills are thorough criminals...but he still killed them, despite his qualms and conscience.Malkovich and Scott do fine jobs. So does Ray Winstone as a crude and unscrupulous former associate of Ripley who provides the trigger for Ripley's scheme. I liked this movie a lot. It's moral tone is shaky, at best. Good doesn't triumph. Bad doesn't win. There's enough ambiguity to be satisfying.The DVD picture looks just fine.

The story per se doesn't have significant changes and the film is perfectly set out in another time.

Bravo Mr. Malkovich!  WHile Damon's Ripley ponders over his crimes with a sense of regret fueled by his need for love, Highsmith's and Malkovich's Ripley is too amoral to care.  And while in this story, the third of the Ripley quintet, we do encounter a slight bit of conscience and perhaps a tad of regret as Tom maliciously involves a dying man in an assasination simply because he was overheard insulting him, we see Ripley in all his unsavory glory, taking control of situations with the swift precision of the sharpest meat cleaver.The plot pretty much follows Hishsmith's novel; a slight change of venue from France to Italy and the substitution of an Italian wife rather a French one for Ripley does not change the opulent backdrop depicting the spoils resulting from Tom's doggedness to live a life of good taste and extravagent wealth.If you are a fan of the Highsmith novels, I recommend this as a must-see.  If you are not acquainted with the books, do become so---get to know Tom's  malignant audacity and then check out Malkovich's rather on target portrayal.

Both movies are about people without a conscience.  And about their games.Unlike most storytellers, Cavani doesn't waste time trying to explain why the Ripleys of the world exist, she just shows them to us.  Ripley's Game starts by showing how different Ripley is from the rest of us, then tries to prove there isn't much difference after all.John Malkovich is perfect as the amoral criminal as artist.  Ripley's crimes pay for his life amid beauty at his Italian villa.  His lover, who understands what he is, is also an artist, a musician.  Even Ripley's chef, ""the finest cook in the Veneto,"" is an artist who immediately understands Ripley's hint when he suggests she ""might want to visit her sister"" when violence threatens the villa.The Ripleys thrive because the rest us, normal people who imagine we live by our scruples, love them and understand them.  We need Ripley and the night porter.Ripley, by now jaded and barely able to remember the ""truly horrible"" things he's done, corrupts an innocent young man for several reasons, and for none, but mostly ""because that's the game.""  Jonathan Trevanny (Dougray Scott) is Ripley's opposite:  a working-class picture-framer, not an art patron and connoisseur, with a nave wife instead of a sophisticate (she doesn't even recognize her boss's lecherous behavior), and with a young son instead of a barren relationship.Jonathan, under financial pressure, becomes capable of the things that Ripley is capable of, and, because of his choices, loses what he loves most.  Ripley seems vindicated in his view of humanity.  (""I lack your conscience.  That used to bother me when I was younger."")But at the last moment Jonathan suprises Ripley and maybe even himself.

Jonathan's wife, too, instinctively shows she is not like those Ripley has surrounded himself with.After a symphony of violence, Ripley attends his lover's concert in an ancient theater where art is classical, preserved from centuries past, not like the pop music that was on the radio at a party in Jonathan's home and at his shop.Earlier, Ripley sat down at the harpsichord with his lover while she was practicing.

I was totally right, but also, totally wrong. The way it goes is totally unexpected, and a laugh. Scott nails the whole British thing.

795064,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00018D40O,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","Patricia Highsmith is one of those novelists whose time, unfortunately, has come posthumously. Though she died in 1996, it has only been recently that her gifts as a novelist have been appreciated.  Much of her core writing examined the psyches of homosexual characters, never exploiting them, only using their sexuality as an enhancement of their full character development.  RIPLEY'S GAME, the most recent transfer of Highsmith's book to film, is part of a trilogy she wrote about the character of Tom Ripley, a sensitive, gentle soul who finds his way into the world of the wealth by means of criminal acts. In the first book of the trilogy THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY,  Tom Ripley is driven by his need for acceptance not only in the (to him) inaccessible world of the wealthy, but also in his urgent need to be loved by other men.  In the second novel, RIPLEY UNDERGROUND, Highsmith seems to drop the sexual overtones in favor of pushing Tom Ripley into the arms of a wealthy wife and monetary power, capitalizing on the greed for achievement overshadowing the need for love.  By RIPLEY'S GAME the usual trademark Highsmith sexual innuendoes have nothing to do with Ripley, but are very much present in the life of Ripley's confidant in crime - Reeves.This final installment in the Ripley stories has Ripley as teacher, instructing his pupil in the macabre methods of murder for gain.  In the title role John Malkovich is his usual wily, brilliant, but misdirected self and his performance is superb (if similar to all of his other roles).  Dougray Scott is Ripley's odd pupil Jonathan, Lena Headey his wife Sarah, Ray Winstone is Reeves,  and with Chiara Caselli as Ripley's harpsichordist paramour all four add fine performances.  There is beautiful photography of Berlin and Rome and the movement is kept at a keen pace by Director Liliana Cavani.  So why just 4 stars? There is just not the flavor of Highsmith's lack of predictability here to justify that.  But in all, it is an entertaining movie and sure to encourage more to read the works of Patricia Highsmith.",4,Searching for Patricia Highsmith,1088294400,"06 27, 2004",2004,2070,"['Patricia', 'Highsmith', 'one', 'novelists', 'time', 'unfortunately', 'come', 'posthumously', 'died', '1996', 'only', 'been', 'recently', 'gifts', 'novelist', 'have', 'been', 'appreciated', 'Much', 'core', 'writing', 'examined', 'psyches', 'homosexual', 'characters', 'never', 'exploiting', 'only', 'using', 'sexuality', 'enhancement', 'full', 'character', 'development', 'RIPLEY', 'GAME', 'most', 'recent', 'transfer', 'Highsmith', 'book', 'film', 'part', 'trilogy', 'wrote', 'character', 'Tom', 'Ripley', 'sensitive', 'gentle', 'soul', 'who', 'way', 'world', 'wealth', 'means', 'criminal', 'acts', 'first', 'book', 'trilogy', 'THE', 'TALENTED', 'MR', 'RIPLEY', 'Tom', 'Ripley', 'driven', 'need', 'acceptance', 'not', 'only', 'inaccessible', 'world', 'wealthy', 'also', 'urgent', 'need', 'be', 'loved', 'other', 'men', 'second', 'novel', 'RIPLEY', 'UNDERGROUND', 'Highsmith', 'drop', 'sexual', 'overtones', 'favor', 'pushing', 'Tom', 'Ripley', 'arms', 'wealthy', 'wife', 'monetary', 'power', 'capitalizing', 'greed', 'achievement', 'overshadowing', 'need', 'love', 'RIPLEY', 'GAME', 'usual', 'trademark', 'Highsmith', 'sexual', 'innuendoes', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'Ripley', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'present', 'life', 'Ripley', 'confidant', 'crime', 'Reeves.This', 'final', 'installment', 'Ripley', 'stories', 'Ripley', 'teacher', 'instructing', 'pupil', 'macabre', 'methods', 'murder', 'gain', 'title', 'role', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'usual', 'wily', 'brilliant', 'misdirected', 'self', 'performance', 'superb', 'similar', 'other', 'roles', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'Ripley', 'odd', 'pupil', 'Jonathan', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Reeves', 'Chiara', 'Caselli', 'Ripley', 'harpsichordist', 'four', 'add', 'fine', 'performances', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'Berlin', 'Rome', 'movement', 'kept', 'keen', 'pace', 'Director', 'Liliana', 'Cavani', 'So', 'why', 'just', '4', 'stars', 'just', 'not', 'flavor', 'Highsmith', 'lack', 'predictability', 'here', 'justify', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'sure', 'encourage', 'more', 'read', 'works', 'Patricia', 'Highsmith']",Ripley's Game

Tom Ripley (John Malkovich), deeply offended by this insult by Jonathan Trevanny (Dougray Scott), engages the gentle Jonathan in a plot to commit murder, partly because he is an innocent but also because of Jonathan's harsh words spoken about him in public. Ripley also knows that Jonathan is dying with leukemia, is strapped for money and very vulnerable.""Ripley's Game"" is based on the Patricia Highsmith novel of that same title. Although I have not yet read the novel, I have read two other splendid Ripley novels, THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY and RIPLEY UNDER WATER, Highsmith's last in the series. Malkovich's portrayal is in keeping with the Ripley in those two novels and I suspect is pretty close to the way Highsmith develops him in RIPLEY's GAME. He is a cultured sociopath who kills with no conscience. As he tells the deeply troubled Jonathan so new to the art of killing, when you take someone out, there is ""one less car on the road."" On the other hand, he likes fine food, good wine, art and classical music.Much of the film, directed by Liliana Cavani, takes place in Italy and Germany. Tom is far afield from the young American we met in both the first Ripley novel and the film starring Matt Damon. Malkovich is believable as a cold-blooded killer. Just look at his eyes; they tell it all.

There's very little energy driving the thing as it lumbers from scene to scene, and it was quite a chore to sit through the whole film.Perhaps my largest complaint is that the characters have no inner life. After the fascinating psychological exploration of Tom Ripley offered in Minghella's ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" this film doesn't even try to let us inside his mind.The narrative focus is not really on Ripley anyway, but on Dougray Scott's everyman. He, too, remains uninvolving, in spite of Scott's committed performance, because we're not allowed into his feelings either.There are a laundry list of things Scott's character goes through that are never explored. He's dying of Leukemia, yet this is barely more than a plot point. He is an ordinary man, who decides to commit a murder for money for his family, yet he needs only a brief moment of consideration onscreen to make this life-altering decision.Later, when he learns that his bland neighbor Ripley is actually a ruthless murderer and proceeds to help him to do away with three men, he barely even bats an eye. And again, when his wife learns what he's been doing and decides to take their son and leave him, he seems only mildly perturbed.Where is any sense of who this man is? If only the film had let us understand either of these characters it might have been worthwhile.The locations in Berlin and around Italy are certainly pretty and moodily photographed, and master composer Ennio Morricone tries to tie the disparate elements of the film together with an effective score which is often vastly better than the film.

795067,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00018D40O,J from NY,"[3, 4]","""Ripley's Game"" is terrifying, humorous, and possesses an infectious cancer that makes you sympathize deeply with John Malkovich's older Tom Ripley, a sociopathic aesthete who seems to appreciate the finest forms of art--classical music, painting, Italian symphonies--and then in the same hour garrote four people on a subway train with only one concern: whether or not his expensive Brazilian watch has broken.In this film, Ripley has retired to a villa in Italy with a beautiful girlfriend he plans to marry.  At times Malkovich clearly steps out of sociopathic form to add a little warmth to Ripley's charming and repulsive character: he hangs on every word she says, buys her a fabulous organ from the old country, and bakes her the finest bread he can find.  All the while he is fixated on one unfortunate man, a middle-aged picture framer dying of cancer, who made the mistake of insulting Ripley at a dinner party while he was standing behind him.  Jonathan Trevanny is the everyman, unremarkable except for his growing misfortune, with a newborn child and a loving wife adding to his well founded financial existential anxieties.Ripley's thug friend Reeves (played with impeccable slime by Ray Winstone) hires Trevanny for the assassination of a Russian drugdealer.Despite his obvious moral tribulations about the matter, he actually does it: when Ripley discovers this, he is dumbfounded.  One gets the chilling impression that somehow, in some way, Ripley knew he was capable of it.The pay off is 50,000 dollars and this enables Jonathan to ensure a future for his child.Reeves then propositions Jonathan to garrote a Balkan mob boss on a train, but Ripley, for mysterious reasons, will not allow Jonathan to be used in this way.  First of all he is incapable of it, and there also seems to be a demented paternal quality to their relationship.  Malkovich is perfect as this soulless and yet somehow affectionate robot of a man--he voice is calm, warm, possessing full knowledge that he is without a conscience and desperately wanting to know why.At one point he tells Jonathan flatly: ""When I was younger, about your age, it troubled me badly that I lacked what you're displaying now: a conscience.  It no longer does.  I'm not afraid of witnesses or people because I don't feel that anyone's watching.  Nothing momentous just happened on this train.  The world is not any lesser now that these men are gone.  A little less noise, a little less harm, perhaps, that's all.""The ending of the film is a gesture of self sacrifice on the part of Jonathan which may or may not change Tom Ripley: the ending of this twisted and somehow hilarious film is actually upbeat in a way.  Ripley is able, perhaps for the only time in his life, to appreciate or witness that most unusual of human behavior: selflessness.  This is one of the most drop dead funny films I have ever seen: Malkovich is the wittiest and most carefree sociopath in the history of film, as far as I can see.  His dialogue is priceless.  Ennio Morricone's score is gorgeous and sets the mood very well.

Rooney,"[0, 0]","""Ripley's Game,"" a movie version of the Patricia Highsmith novel, like the ""Talented Ripley"" (the Matt Damon flick) takes considerable liberties with her text. George Malkovich does a fine job in the part of Tom Ripley, although I feel he's wrong, too effete, for the part. The beginning scene in Berlin, not from the book, is there to establish Tom's character as a murderer and a crook who does errands for a thief named Reeves (Ray Winstone).In the movie Ripley's home is far too elaborate, too much like a palace rather than a country villa. A picture framer, Jonathan Trevanny, makes scurrilous remarks about Tom, and Tom decides to get back at him by setting him up through Reeves as an assassin. Trevanny goes along with the crime because he's dying of cancer and wants to take care of his wife and son after his death.In the movie Tom's wife, Heloise, is his enabler as she is in four books of the series, but he didn't let in her in on his nefarious schemes the way he does in the movie.The killing scene in the zoo in which Trevanny kills a Russian mob boss is very effective.

795069,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00018D40O,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[6, 7]","""Ripley's Game"" is the semi-sequel to Anthony Minghella's brilliant ""The Talented Mr. Ripley."" I want to say first and foremost, if you didn't like that film...Stay away from this one. Anyway, I call it a semi-sequel because there's no connection between either film besides the source novel by Patricia Highsmith. In Ripley's Game, Tom Ripley is much older now and living in Europe with a wife Louisa; But he's still up to his old tricks and he's still talented. The movie begins after Ripley has a disagreement with a man he's selling some drawings to; Ripley is dealing with a man named Reeves (Ray Winstone, 'Sexy Beast'), but what happens isn't even that important. Ripley makes it clear he doesn't want to see Reeves again which essentially sets the plot in motion. Three years later, Reeves returns and offers Ripley a large sum of money to kill a Russian guy. Ripley doesn't want to do it, however and suggests Jonathan Trevanny (Dougray Scott, 'The Legend of Zorro'). Jonathan barely knows Ripley and has no idea that Ripley has just suggested his name as a potential hit man, but when Reeves offers Jonathan the money...He eventually agrees, due in part to the fact he was just diagnosed with leukemia. This movie eventually becomes Jonathan's movie for the most part. Every event in the movie is basically guided by Ripley, but his screen time isn't what you would think it would be. This film, for the record, is not better than The Talented Mr. Ripley. It's not as beautifully photographed, nor as entertaining. But, John Malkovich is the definitive Tom Ripley. Don't get me wrong, Matt Damon was amazing as Ripley...He captured the many layers of Ripley's personality, being both charming and murderous. Malkovich does the same thing, but Malkovich has the icy cool stare and way of speaking that makes him the embodiment of Ripley. Malkovich just has this way of saying his dialouge, which I might add is great. There's some lines that a lot of actors couldn't do, Malkovich thrives on them. ""Be careful with that watch, because if it breaks I'll kill every person on this train"". But besides Malkovich; Scott, who I hated in Zorro, is surprisingly effective as Jonathan; Winstone is great as Reeves...The whole cast is great. The movie is entertaining; I think the train/death scene with Malkovich and Scott was very fun to watch. As I said, there's no relation between either film. There's not even a scene where Ripley reminisces...Despite that, looking at this as both a sequel and stand alone film it works.GRADE: A-",5,"Same Talent, Different Ripley",1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,2536,"['Ripley', 'Game', 'semi-sequel', 'Anthony', 'Minghella', 'brilliant', 'Talented', 'Mr', 'Ripley', 'want', 'say', 'first', 'foremost', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'Stay', 'away', 'one', 'Anyway', 'call', 'semi-sequel', 'connection', 'film', 'source', 'novel', 'Patricia', 'Highsmith', 'Ripley', 'Game', 'Tom', 'Ripley', 'much', 'older', 'now', 'living', 'Europe', 'wife', 'Louisa', 'still', 'up', 'old', 'tricks', 'still', 'talented', 'movie', 'Ripley', 'disagreement', 'man', 'selling', 'drawings', 'Ripley', 'dealing', 'man', 'named', 'Reeves', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Beast', 'what', ""n't"", 'even', 'important', 'Ripley', 'clear', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'Reeves', 'again', 'essentially', 'plot', 'motion', 'Three', 'years', 'later', 'Reeves', 'returns', 'Ripley', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'kill', 'Russian', 'guy', 'Ripley', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'however', 'Jonathan', 'Trevanny', 'Dougray', 'Scott', ""'The"", 'Legend', 'Zorro', 'Jonathan', 'barely', 'Ripley', 'idea', 'Ripley', 'just', 'suggested', 'name', 'potential', 'hit', 'man', 'when', 'offers', 'Jonathan', 'money', 'eventually', 'due', 'part', 'fact', 'was', 'just', 'diagnosed', 'leukemia', 'movie', 'eventually', 'Jonathan', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'event', 'movie', 'basically', 'guided', 'Ripley', 'screen', 'time', ""n't"", 'what', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'record', 'not', 'better', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'not', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'entertaining', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'definitive', 'Tom', 'Ripley', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'was', 'amazing', 'Ripley', 'captured', 'many', 'layers', 'Ripley', 'personality', 'being', 'charming', 'murderous', 'Malkovich', 'same', 'thing', 'Malkovich', 'icy', 'cool', 'stare', 'way', 'speaking', 'embodiment', 'Ripley', 'Malkovich', 'just', 'way', 'saying', 'dialouge', 'might', 'add', 'great', 'lines', 'lot', 'actors', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'Malkovich', 'Be', 'careful', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'person', 'train', 'Malkovich', 'Scott', 'who', 'hated', 'Zorro', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'Jonathan', 'Winstone', 'great', 'Reeves', 'whole', 'cast', 'great', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'think', 'train/death', 'scene', 'Malkovich', 'Scott', 'was', 'very', 'fun', 'watch', 'said', 'relation', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'scene', 'where', 'Ripley', 'reminisces', 'looking', 'sequel', 'stand', 'alone', 'film', 'A-']",Ripley's Game

Having read the complete ""Ripley"" series, and then seeing the two films made based from the books, I still conclude that these films, and now particularly RIPLEY'S GAME just doesn't build up enough steam to propel this train down the tracks! It starts...it moves a little...we see some action,but we see very little character development.The book,I still feel, is rather so-so and I don't think that the movie fares any better.The ""sociopathic"" Tom Ripley is now older and has been living in a Villa, is married to a talented harpsichordist,and has become rather complacent in the last three years,not fooling any one,no swindles,no murders.Ripley (John Malkovich) feels insulted at a gala one night by art framer Jonathan Trevanny.At this point,Reeves (Ray Winstone), an ex-partner in crime to Ripley, proposes that a ""hit"" needs to be made on a Russian mobster.Ripley hatches the plan to entice Jonathan, who is rapidly dying of leukemia,to do the murder for a total of $100,000.Jonathan (Dougray Scott) wrestles with the idea and relents to do his first killing.Jonathan, though,becomes involved up to his dying neck in more crimes for money and that is the crux of the story!Now...though this sounds possibly interesting,it only mildly gets sparked.This film is like watching a barely lighted fire that is always in danger of expiring if something or someone does not rekindle the flame,The flame is barely relit and the movie creeps its way to an end with mild promise, but little to recommend a second viewing.I personally do not find that  John Malkovich (who seemed to be replaying his Valmont from DANGEROUS LIAISONS,only with less effect) as the older Ripley has made this character compelling enough to jump from the pages to the screen like Matt Damon did in the original THE TALENTED MR.RIPLEY.Ripley is neither interesting enough to hate or sympathetic enough to be loved.He is a most difficult character,on both page and screen, to really hold my attention in this installment.Dougray Scott, on the other hand, does more with his gaunt,leukemia-stricken Jonathan, as he is the real heart of both the book and the film.BUT,there is still a lot that is not clear about Jonathan's motivations to taking on the kill thrill.This is a handsomely made film.It is pleasing to the eye, and the soundtrack by Ennio Morricone is amply satisfying, but all-in-all RIPLEY'S GAME should be played elsewhere.As Amazon states,and I agree, the film is ""nebulous.""",3,RIPLEY'S GAME never gathers enough steam to be totally absorbing,1197072000,"12 8, 2007",2007,2556,"['When', 'film', 'more', 'interesting', 'stylish', 'look', 'soundtrack', 'then', 'something', 'missing', 'Having', 'read', 'complete', 'Ripley', 'series', 'then', 'seeing', 'two', 'films', 'made', 'based', 'books', 'still', 'conclude', 'films', 'now', 'particularly', 'RIPLEY', 'GAME', 'just', ""n't"", 'build', 'up', 'enough', 'steam', 'propel', 'train', 'down', 'tracks', 'little', 'see', 'action', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'character', 'development.The', 'book', 'still', 'feel', 'rather', 'so-so', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'better.The', 'sociopathic', 'Tom', 'Ripley', 'now', 'older', 'been', 'living', 'Villa', 'married', 'talented', 'harpsichordist', 'become', 'rather', 'complacent', 'last', 'three', 'years', 'not', 'fooling', 'one', 'swindles', 'murders.Ripley', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'feels', 'insulted', 'gala', 'one', 'night', 'art', 'framer', 'Jonathan', 'Trevanny.At', 'point', 'Reeves', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'ex-partner', 'crime', 'Ripley', 'hit', 'needs', 'be', 'made', 'Russian', 'mobster.Ripley', 'plan', 'entice', 'Jonathan', 'who', 'rapidly', 'dying', 'leukemia', 'do', 'murder', 'total', '100,000.Jonathan', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'idea', 'relents', 'do', 'first', 'killing.Jonathan', 'though', 'becomes', 'involved', 'up', 'dying', 'neck', 'more', 'crimes', 'money', 'crux', 'story', 'Now', 'possibly', 'interesting', 'only', 'mildly', 'sparked.This', 'film', 'watching', 'barely', 'lighted', 'fire', 'always', 'danger', 'expiring', 'something', 'someone', 'not', 'rekindle', 'flame', 'flame', 'barely', 'relit', 'movie', 'way', 'end', 'mild', 'promise', 'little', 'recommend', 'second', 'viewing.I', 'personally', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'who', 'seemed', 'be', 'replaying', 'Valmont', 'DANGEROUS', 'LIAISONS', 'only', 'less', 'effect', 'older', 'Ripley', 'made', 'character', 'compelling', 'enough', 'jump', 'pages', 'screen', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'did', 'original', 'THE', 'TALENTED', 'MR.RIPLEY.Ripley', 'interesting', 'enough', 'hate', 'sympathetic', 'enough', 'be', 'loved.He', 'most', 'difficult', 'character', 'page', 'screen', 'really', 'hold', 'attention', 'installment.Dougray', 'Scott', 'other', 'hand', 'more', 'gaunt', 'leukemia-stricken', 'Jonathan', 'real', 'heart', 'book', 'film.BUT', 'still', 'lot', 'not', 'clear', 'Jonathan', 'motivations', 'taking', 'kill', 'thrill.This', 'handsomely', 'made', 'film.It', 'pleasing', 'eye', 'soundtrack', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'amply', 'satisfying', 'all-in-all', 'RIPLEY', 'GAME', 'should', 'be', 'played', 'elsewhere.As', 'Amazon', 'states', 'agree', 'film', 'nebulous']",Ripley's Game

John Malkovich stars as Ripley, a self-described ""talented improvisor"" that lives like a prince in an Italian estate thanks to his mischevious nature. His lifestyle as killer and art thief supports his girlfriend's high falutin' keyboard career in addition to his own very prosperous lifestyle.When a 9-to-5 married picture framer unknowingly insults Ripley during a party, he sets up the schnook through lowlife partner Ray Winstone -- an earthy foil to Malkovich's refined character -- and he is soon knee deep in an enterprise of murder and mayhem that monumentally disrupts life for his lovely wife and young son. This, Ripley suggests, is ""the game.""Soon the picture framer -- who is driven to murder by greed and his own cancer -- is led into a deepening morass of killing and greed where Ripley is both antagonist and protagonist. The action is carried out with worldliness, humor and subtlety, all very European. In the end it is never clear who wins or loses and which is really the bad guy. Almost everyone besides Ripley loses something, proving he is master of his own game.My favorite John Malkovich movie was filmed in Italy and Germany. Ennio Morricone's alternately minimalist and lyrical score adds dimension to the mystery. This is a rewarding flick for anyone that likes mystery, murder and good filmmaking with a few plot twists.

In contrast, a gangster from Ripley's past, played perfectly by Ray Winston, a crude, deliberative criminal, orders executions to facilitate taking over key aspects of the Russian mob's trade. Miffed after an insult by a guest who is dying of leukemia, Jonathan Trevanny (Dougray Scott), Ripley submits John's name to the gangster as a potential assassin for the Russian hits, since the ill man is desperate for money. But Ripley's former Berlin crony (Winston) gets greedy, expecting the dying Trevanny to perform ever more outrageous acts, threatening his family if he fails to cooperate. Chastened, or out of some obscure gentleman's instinct, Ripley steps in to assist Jonathan and the best laid plans quickly spiral out of control when one of the Russians survives the garrote and the gunshot, coming to Italy in pursuit of his attackers; he hasn't come alone.With his usual suave demeanor and penchant for downplaying the dramatic, Malkovich, as Ripley, takes it all in stride, preparing for the inevitable bloodshed. Violent confrontations ensue, bodies strewn across the Tuscan landscape, the usual fallout of mob conflict, desperate men and professional killers. The twists and turns of a well-plotted script enhance the believability of this film, but it is Malkovich's play all the way, as riveting as ever in his skillful rendering of a complex character who savors each moment of existence. While Dougray Scott can't compete with the master, he gives his role a good shot, the inimitable Ray Winston uncouthly memorable as is his wont. This unusual group makes a fine romp of what could have been a foolish film, each actor bringing his own subtle touches to bear.

Although Malkovich's performance is benevolently malevolent and annoyingly monotonous, his skill as an actor makes us accept him as the consciousless Mr. Ripley.  This time, the film focuses on dying leukemia framemaker Dougray Scott, who finds himself taking a job as a hitman for a previous associate of Ripley's (Ray Winstone in a sturdy performance).  After a successful hit, Winstone uses Scott's family as a pawn to do another job.  This hit however isn't quite successful and it's up to Ripley to get Scott out of the frying pan.  Ironically, it was Ripley who recommended Scott to Winstone because he overheard an insult at a party hosted by Scott.RIPLEY'S GAME's real strength lies in the tragic character of Jonathan, which Scott imbues with intense confusion, desperation and fear, and Scott steals the movie away from Malkovich.  It's probably because Ripley continues to be such a cold and unfeeling character that even with his obvious ""redemption"" in the final scene, Ripley just isn't admirable.

Matt Damon played a young Ripley in the superb 1999 film &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, directed by Anthony Minghella. &quot;Ripley's Game&quot; finds an older Ripley, played by John Malkovich, semi-retired and living a life of luxury with his wife on a grand Italian estate. A partner in crime from the past, Reeves (Ray Winstone), now a Berlin nightclub mogul, turns up on Ripley's doorstep seeking the favor of an assassination. Reluctant to do the job himself, Ripley decides to make a game of goading an ethical but desperate neighbor (Dougray Scott) into a life of crime.&quot;Ripley's Game&quot; features two interesting performances: those of John Malkovich and Ray Winstone. Malkovich is always interesting, but Winstone may actually top him here. For one thing, even though Ripley is the most interesting character, he's nearly missing from the middle section of this film. Malkovich makes a superb Ripley, but we don't see enough of him or his manipulations. We see more of Ray Winstone and Dougray Scott, as manipulator and complicitous victim. The story is actually interesting, but Ripley is shortchanged by this script. Winstone gives a powerful performance, but there aren't enough layers to his character to compensate for Ripley's too often peripheral presence. And the neighbor, Jonathan Trevanny, is neither despicable or sympathetic. He evokes no reaction at all. Nice scenery, talented cast, interesting premise, but it doesn't come together effectively.The DVD: Subtitles are available in Spanish and English.

And it's not even just that it's so pale in comparison to the Matt Damon/ Jude Law film.  This movie is terrible in and of itself.First of all there's the cinematography that looks like it belongs on tv, scratch that, on tv in the 80s.Then Ennio Morricone's score that sounds like a B horror movie.  (And I'd like to state here that Morricone always disappoints I don't understand how he managed to write the haunting score to the Mission, which is surely one of the best in movie history, as every other soundtrack I've heard by him is just [...])  It's better to have no music and than bad music and this movie should have opted for plan B.I feel that cinematography and music are among most important aspects of movie, not because they make a movie good, but because they can soooooo easily destroy a movie that would be good otherwise.  If these two things are screwed up the only thing that can save the movie is the best script and actors money can buy.  This movie has neither.  I've never seen such over acting outside of a melodrama and as for the script, sometimes I thought it was going for a comedy and missed.  To be honest I can't even imagine Patrica's original novel could have been any good in the first place as the plot is so silly.At the start I said I don't know what to say and I've said a lot but really I think I could say it best by pointing out the fact the Mystery Science Theater 3000 has often featured better movies than this failure.",1,This Was Just Terrible....,1145145600,"04 16, 2006",2006,1543,"['do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'say', 'How', 'got', 'such', 'great', 'reviews', 'not', 'even', 'just', 'so', 'pale', 'comparison', 'Matt', 'Damon/', 'Jude', 'Law', 'film', 'movie', 'terrible', 'itself.First', 'cinematography', 'tv', 'scratch', 'tv', '80s.Then', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'score', 'B', 'horror', 'movie', ""'d"", 'like', 'state', 'here', 'Morricone', 'always', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'managed', 'write', 'haunting', 'score', 'Mission', 'surely', 'one', 'best', 'movie', 'history', 'other', 'soundtrack', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'just', '[', ']', 'better', 'have', 'music', 'bad', 'music', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'opted', 'plan', 'B.I', 'feel', 'cinematography', 'music', 'are', 'most', 'important', 'aspects', 'movie', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'good', 'can', 'soooooo', 'easily', 'destroy', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'otherwise', 'two', 'things', 'are', 'screwed', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'save', 'movie', 'best', 'script', 'actors', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'movie', 'neither', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'such', 'acting', 'outside', 'melodrama', 'script', 'sometimes', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'comedy', 'missed', 'be', 'honest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'imagine', 'Patrica', 'original', 'novel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'first', 'place', 'plot', 'so', 'silly.At', 'start', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'say', ""'ve"", 'said', 'lot', 'really', 'think', 'could', 'say', 'best', 'pointing', 'out', 'fact', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'often', 'featured', 'better', 'movies', 'failure']",Ripley's Game

795081,A13DQTXG02HZC1,B00018D40O,Ping Lim,"[7, 8]","If you were a keen follower of the Hannibal's franchise, this movie would suit you nicely.  Whilst the Talented Mr. Ripley (the movie) showed us of the coming of him, Ripley's Game indicated how he had blossomed into a seasoned sociopath.  John Malkovich was at his sleek-slimy self & it's hard not to be enchanted by him.  The setting was gorgeous and did I mention about the preusal of an actual Palladio villa in Italy?  Ripley described himself nicely when he told Dougray Scott's dying character who was enticed to commit a murder(s) that it used to bother him that he didn't have a conscience but not anymore.  To top that up, Ripley explained that one good thing about committing evil things were that after a few days, he wouldn't remember anything anymore.  How Dougray Scott's character found attachment to the enigmatic Ripley was inexplicable but they did anyhow and formed a rather surreal alliance against the mobsters.  The movie was moving along at an even pace and amid the calmness, there was always a tense or edginess to the environment.  The relationship of Ripley and his live-in partner, an accomplished Italian harpischodist revealed a conditional relationship of the dominating and the dominated, no questions asked and rewards would come accordingly kind of a relationship.  I guess this movie revealed to us that we all have a propensity to do something outlandish or totally evil.  We are standing on a very fine line and all we need is a very minor catch to catch us off-guard.  Outstanding cast all around but notably, Ray Winstone who played Ripley's ex-partner.  Such a tasty movie to sit through.  An edge-of-the-seat thriller that slowly unfolded itself but truly satisfying.

795082,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B00018D40O,"Promise ""promise""","[3, 4]","I went to see The Talented Mr. Ripley, on the strength of its cast, knowing nothing of Ms. Highsmith's novels.  I was captivated by the story in all of its surprising twists and turns. I found, somewhat to my alarm, that I was rooting for the criminal, and greatly relieved when he got away with murder.  Hmmm.So, several years later, when I saw a DVD with the name Ripley on it, and John Malkevich's face, I assumed that it was about the same character.  I thought to myself, that Malkovich, who plays ""strange"" so well, would be a perfect Ripley.  I picked it up along with five others and, again, when it came time to choose, found myself almost going against my better impulses by chosing this film.  I told myself it was sick and evil and I shouldn't indulge in such rot.  And, I watched it, captivated as before by this amazing man!It was interested to see how Tom Ripley had developed in the years since we saw him (as Matt Damon).  He had outgrown his youthful insecurities and was deeply entrenched in his life as amoral lover of the good things in life.  Any qualms about his life style seemed to have long since been quenched.  The opening scene, in Berlin, (which is scarey enough) shows Ripley in great form, the discriminating art dealer, who doesn't hesitate to murder a fellow who has dared to handle his drawings.  The switch from soft spoken aesthete to brutal killer is stunning.  Then, he resumes his hyper cool persona, again outside, commenting to his business associate that the meeting was ""interesting.""So, for anyone who missed the books or first film, the enigmatic character of Tom Ripley is  well displayed.  The story is fascinating, involving not only the complexity of Ripley's character, but that of his polar opposite, a poor picture framer with a loving wife and child.  Jonathan, the framer, invites Ripley over for a birthday party, at his modest but warm home with a group of friends.  He makes the mistake of commenting to his friends, that Ripley, with all his money, has ostentatious bad taste and has completely ruined the heart and soul of the old villa he bought.  dum de dum dum...Ripley, standing in the doorway has heard this.  Poor Jonathan doesn't know that one thing you should never do to Tom Ripley is criticize his bad taste!  He will live to regret this innocent statement..and die.What I found so interesting about this story, is not just the obvious fascination with this cool character who has a habit of getting away with murder, but the relationship between these two men.  Johnathan is the hard working, low paid artisan, who has a hard time making ends meet but he is rich in the sense of having a beautiful adoring wife and a precious son.  He seems to be the kind of guy who always plays by the rules, does what he believes is good and right and gets the short end of the stick.His wife has to work and submit herself to being lecherously ogled by her boss, and to make things as bad as possible, he has terminal leukemia.It's almost as if these two opposites are drawn together, like the little black and white magnet dogs we used to play with as kids.  Ripley, the bloodless winner, who gets everything he wants in life, by ignoring conventional morality.  His home is huge, his fortune is assured, and he even has a beautiful woman of his own, a famous harpsichordist.  At Jonathan's party, his wife tells Ripley that she wished she could do something creative, like R's lover.  Ripley seems to like her and assures her that the sweater she has knitted is beautiful and that she is indeed creative.As it has been shown in other Ripley novels, he has a way of absorbing the qualities of other people.  First it was rich Dickie Greenleaf, who introduced the whole opulent lifestyle to him.  Now, that he has thorougly mastered ""rich"" perhaps it's time for him to move up the evolutionary scale to something more humane.  At least that's what I saw here.In the first part of the film, Ripley is running true to form, by cleverly manipulating poor Jonathan into becoming a killer-for-hire.  We see Jonathan, who at first is completely appalled by this offer, gradually weaken and give in.  True, his motives are sterling -- to provide for his family after his death.  But still...murder!  It's so out of his character that he goes through lots of angst before and during the ""job.""  Amazingly, he pulled it off very well.  His conscience racks him, though, and he lies about the money to his wife, who occupies the same moral high ground as he does.  He knows she would not go for this!He thinks his trouble is over, with the money hidden under the kitchen sink, until the fellow who set up the deal, with Ripley's help, returns, to want another murder done.  Jonathan refuses until he realizes that his wife and child will be killed if he doesn't go along with it.At this point in the story, there is a shift and this is what I find most fascinating.  Ripley, for some reason that he cannot explain, decides to put a stop to this and forbids the intermediary from involving Jonathan further.  It's too late, though, and we see the poor guy, sweating as usual, with his angst ridden face, bording a train to Dusseldorf to strangle a member of the Russian mafia.  Things get very exciting and dangerous and then....out of the men's room, appears our man Ripley to help out the suffering Jonathan.  It's quite amazing and horrible and even funny.From then on the two are buddies.  We see them playing chess, which is quite symbolic, if you think about it.  Ripley has taken a protective role towards Jonathan, and, knowing that the Russians will be coming to get him, prohibts Jonathan from coming to his home.  Jonathan, though, for his part, perhaps to pay Ripley back for saving his life on the train, shows up anyway to help Ripley.  It's the ultimate twist in this convoluted plot.At one point, after the train murder, after Jonathan has spent 20 minutes vomiting, Ripley, cool as ever, politely reminds him that they have a plane to catch.  J. asks R. why he has bothered to save his life and R. says he doesn't really know, but mumbles something about the fact that we are always being born.In the final sequence, where J. and R. are sequestered in the villa, awaiting the Russians, J. complains that he can't stand waiting.  R. lets drop one very telling statement--that as a child, once he waited and waited for his parents to return from a boat trip.  Then, in his impassive bloodless way, he says, ""They drowned.""  Oh boy!  No wonder this poor guy has built a shell of defensiveness over his heart.  And no wonder the sight of a man who goes to such lengths, sweating all the way, to provide for his wife and son, is what begins to open his own heart again.You have to sort of hunt for this, though.  The director, in true Ripleyesque style does not dwell on it....but, wow!  Think about it.I do like happy endings and I was glad that I watched this film.  I recommend it for anyone, especially those willing to look a little under the surface.Did I mention that Malkevich was perfect?  He was astounding....both in the bloodless scenes and in the final few where he becomes a little more human.  Watch the facial expressions, listen to the voice.  It's an amazing performance.  Cheers to the director, too, who handles the whole thing perfectly, establishing just the right tone between horrific and human and even humorous.",5,"Fascinating story, brilliantly

I have to say that I'm not a big fan of either adaptation of The Talented Mr. Ripley to hit the screen (Minghella's 1999 adaptation with Matt Damon and Purple Noon, Rene Clement's 1960 adaptation), and that factored into it as well. And while John Malkovich is a fine actor, him as Tom Ripley? I was expecting mot to enjoy this all that much, but as it's Cavani, I had to check it out, and I ended up enjoying it more than I thought I would.Tom Ripley (Malkovich) has grown into a wealthy landowner, continuing his life of fraud and violence on one hand while living the happily-married life of the idle rich on the other. As we open, Reeves (Ray Winstone), an unsavory character from Ripley's past, shows up with a proposal for a contract killing. Ripley doesn't want to get directly involved, so he hatches a plan to get a neighbor of his, Trevanny (Dark Water's Dougray Scott), to do the job. Trevanny is dying, but the extra money could get him an experimental treatment that might prolong his life. Eventually, however, the full breadth of Reeves' plan comes to light, and Ripley realizes Trevanny is in over his head. But when Ripley tries to rectify things, Murphy's law kicks in...Cavani's script is what makes this work. The three leads are all very good actors, but Cavani really gives them something to sink their teeth into in a way the other Highsmith adaptations I've seen haven't done. I'm still not convinced John Malkovich was the best choice for Ripley (Johnny Depp would have been obvious, but I think Cavani wanted to stay within the time frame of the books--this one takes place seventeen years after The Talented Mr. Ripley, and it's no coincidence that John Malkovich is seventeen years older than Matt Damon), but he does get the right blend of manipulation and horror once everything's out in the open. He's just never struck me as a violent guy, and perhaps my problem with him in this is that I never quite got past the idea that I was watching John Malkovich rather than watching Tim Ripley. That's a minor quibble, though, and this is a solid film that should have gotten much wider release in this country than it did; give it a look. *** ",4,"My favorite Ripley adaptation to date, but I couldn't get past the Malkovich factor.",1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,2442,"['Ripley', 'Game', 'Liliana', 'Cavani', '2003', ""'ve"", 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Liliana', 'Cavani', 'first', 'saw', 'Night', 'Porter', 'solidly', 'list', 'hundred', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'everything', 'Ripley', 'Game', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'right', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'adaptation', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'hit', 'screen', 'Minghella', '1999', 'adaptation', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Purple', 'Noon', 'Rene', 'Clement', '1960', 'adaptation', 'factored', 'as', 'well', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'fine', 'actor', 'Tom', 'Ripley', 'was', 'expecting', 'mot', 'enjoy', 'that', 'much', 'Cavani', 'had', 'check', 'out', 'ended', 'up', 'enjoying', 'more', 'thought', 'would.Tom', 'Ripley', 'Malkovich', 'grown', 'wealthy', 'landowner', 'continuing', 'life', 'fraud', 'violence', 'one', 'hand', 'living', 'happily-married', 'life', 'idle', 'rich', 'other', 'open', 'Reeves', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'unsavory', 'character', 'Ripley', 'past', 'up', 'proposal', 'contract', 'killing', 'Ripley', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'directly', 'involved', 'plan', 'get', 'neighbor', 'Trevanny', 'Dark', 'Water', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'do', 'job', 'Trevanny', 'dying', 'extra', 'money', 'could', 'get', 'experimental', 'treatment', 'might', 'prolong', 'life', 'Eventually', 'however', 'full', 'breadth', 'Reeves', 'plan', 'light', 'Ripley', 'realizes', 'Trevanny', 'head', 'when', 'Ripley', 'rectify', 'things', 'Murphy', 'law', 'kicks', 'Cavani', 'script', 'what', 'work', 'three', 'leads', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'Cavani', 'really', 'something', 'sink', 'teeth', 'way', 'other', 'Highsmith', 'adaptations', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'convinced', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'was', 'best', 'choice', 'Ripley', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'obvious', 'think', 'Cavani', 'wanted', 'stay', 'time', 'frame', 'books', 'one', 'place', 'seventeen', 'years', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'coincidence', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'seventeen', 'years', 'older', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'get', 'right', 'blend', 'manipulation', 'horror', 'once', 'everything', 'out', 'open', 'just', 'never', 'struck', 'violent', 'guy', 'perhaps', 'problem', 'never', 'quite', 'got', 'idea', 'was', 'watching', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'rather', 'watching', 'Tim', 'Ripley', 'minor', 'quibble', 'solid', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'much', 'wider', 'release', 'country', 'did', 'give', 'look', '***']",Ripley's Game

That film, which was the first in the ""Ripley"" series, showed how a young, vulnerable Tom Ripley launched his ""career"" as a murdering con artist.  Matt Damon was phenomenal at capturing the desperation of the young criminal genius balancing on the razor's edge and coming to terms with his own dark side.""Ripley's Game"" takes on Tom Ripley at the twilight of his career, and John Malkovich is the perfect casting choice.  No longer is Tom Ripley vulnerable, or wondering about exactly who he is.  No stolen identies, no phony back-stories, Tom Ripley now lives openly and well as himself, having made his millions, restored a gorgeous villa in the Veneto, and charmed his way into the heart of a nubile harpsichord prodigy (Chiara Caselli).  He's still an enigma to his neighbors, all of whom are aware of him but none know him.A poor picture framer, Jonathan (Dougray Scott) makes the misfortune of giving voice to his envy of the rich American millioinaire at a party.  Unaware that Ripley is standing behind him, Jonathan complains that Ripley has ""restored the soul out of"" his villa, and he's the worst kind of American - rich but with no taste.  Ripley stars at him with those reptilian eyes, and you can see the wheels of vengeance turning even as Ripley accepts Jonathan's lame apology.And what revenge!  It is an open secret that Jonathan is relatively poor but also has terminal leukemia.  Married to the gorgeous Sarah (Lena Headey) and father to a young tyke, Jonathan is furious at fate and desperate to provide for his family after he is gone.  So Ripley offers up Jonathan to an oily former colleague, Reeves (Ray Winstone, of ""Sexy Beast"") who needs a hit man to off a rival.  Dangling money and the prospect of the best health care money can buy, Reeves soon has Jonathan committing murder for hire.All this is a set-up for when things get really interesting after the first murder and things, as things always do, spin out of control.  Ripley has to step in to help the floundering Jonathan as the bodies continue to pile up.  But what happens as Ripley begins to form an attachment with Jonathan even as he tears Jonathan's life apart?Malkovich is one of our best actors, and Ripley is a perfect role for him.  Nobody can out-do Malkovich when it comes to conveying dark meanings with a simple glance, turn of the head, or innocent question.  Beyond droll, beyond laconical . . . Malkovich carves a niche standing among other people, but outside of them.  Ripley stares at his enemies as he would an interesting insect, and he stares at his ""friends"" in much the same way.A creepy, sexy, violent movie, ""Ripley's Game"" is not for the faint of heart.

Example - he sets fire to a trunk containing two dead bodies, and as the flames leap up behind him, he whips out his cell phone and calmly orders dozens of flowers for his girlfriend, who will be performing at a concert that evening.He plays Tom Ripley, the man who claims to lack a conscience, and yet still appreciates the finer things in life - he has a sensuous and talented girlfriend, a lovely villa in Italy, and a love of fine food, music, and art. In the film, one of his former associates, a coarse and obnoxious man named Reeves (Ray Winstone), is looking to kill off some of his competition in the nightclub business in Berlin. Ripley recommends he use Jonathan Trevanny (Dougray Scott) as the hitman. Trevanny has a fatal cancer and needs more money to support his wife and son. After much cajoling from Reeves, Jonathan does the deed, but then is horrified to discover that Reeves wants to use him for even more hits. When Reeves steps up the pressure and threatens Trevanny's family, Ripley intervenes, and we see one of the oddest partnerships develop - between the serene sociopath (again, played so marvelously by Malkovich) and the conscience-stricken, cancer-stricken Trevanny (played with such visible emotional agony by Dougray Scott).The acting is superb, the settings are beautiful (such a contrast to the violence), and there are moments of awfully funny wit (usually delivered by Ripley). The movie also gives us a troubling portrayal of what decent men will do when they are desperate; so many wrong choices are made, and ultimately the movie does not end as you would expect.Really, this is a great film, and it's a shame that - because of some distribution error - it was not released in the US.",4,Chilling and absorbing,1091318400,"08 1, 2004",2004,1821,"['John', 'Malkovich', 'eerie', 'ability', 'say', 'do', 'horrible', 'things', 'totally', 'detached', 'manner', 'Example', 'fire', 'trunk', 'containing', 'two', 'dead', 'bodies', 'flames', 'leap', 'up', 'out', 'cell', 'phone', 'calmly', 'orders', 'dozens', 'flowers', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'performing', 'concert', 'plays', 'Tom', 'Ripley', 'man', 'who', 'lack', 'conscience', 'yet', 'still', 'finer', 'things', 'life', 'sensuous', 'talented', 'girlfriend', 'lovely', 'villa', 'Italy', 'love', 'fine', 'food', 'music', 'art', 'film', 'one', 'former', 'associates', 'coarse', 'obnoxious', 'man', 'named', 'Reeves', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'looking', 'kill', 'off', 'competition', 'nightclub', 'business', 'Berlin', 'Ripley', 'use', 'Jonathan', 'Trevanny', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'hitman', 'Trevanny', 'fatal', 'cancer', 'more', 'money', 'support', 'wife', 'son', 'much', 'cajoling', 'Reeves', 'Jonathan', 'deed', 'then', 'horrified', 'discover', 'use', 'even', 'more', 'hits', 'When', 'steps', 'pressure', 'Trevanny', 'family', 'Ripley', 'intervenes', 'see', 'one', 'oddest', 'partnerships', 'develop', 'serene', 'sociopath', 'again', 'played', 'so', 'marvelously', 'Malkovich', 'conscience-stricken', 'cancer-stricken', 'Trevanny', 'played', 'such', 'visible', 'emotional', 'agony', 'Dougray', 'Scott', '.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'settings', 'are', 'beautiful', 'such', 'contrast', 'violence', 'are', 'moments', 'awfully', 'funny', 'wit', 'usually', 'delivered', 'Ripley', 'movie', 'also', 'troubling', 'portrayal', 'what', 'decent', 'men', 'will', 'do', 'when', 'are', 'desperate', 'so', 'many', 'wrong', 'choices', 'are', 'made', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'not', 'end', 'would', 'expect.Really', 'great', 'film', 'shame', 'distribution', 'error', 'was', 'not', 'released', 'US']",Ripley's Game

The author Patricia Highsmith wrote another equally unlikely story which was made into Hitchcocks 'Strangers on a Train'. So if its reality you want perhaps you should look elsewhere.Malkovich dominates the film. He is just naturally blessed with an odd voice and unique screen presence, and he puts it to very good use in this film, particularly in some of the scenes where a nice line in black comedy occurs, which of course ideally suits Malkovichs laconic delivery. Both Ray Winstone and Dougray Scott provide good support with perhaps Scott being the better of the two. His portrayal of a desperate man dying of cancer, who doesn't realise what hes started when he insults Ripley is a fine piece of acting.In some ways it reminded me of 'Hannibal' (another under-rated film) which was also set in a European city.

Words were exactly the needed catalyst that set off the major event of this tale of debauchery, twisted social behavior, dishonest and dangerous ""fencing"" of phony ""master art""  dealings - and a host of other crimes -  that are somehow bound by a questionable ""code of honor"".  In the midst of this, a few select people pop up as needing murdered, presenting a dilemma of sorts for Ripley, who is picky about whom he decides to kill and for what reason.John Malkovich, splendid as Tom Ripley; a calm, brilliant sociopath who keeps a child bride as a pet when he needs quiet time, is partnered in crime with a seedy, crude and uneducated but cunning common thief whom he feels is far beneath his own social standing; he can barely stand to be in the same room with him - but business is business.  One night, on a fateful invitation, Tom goes to the home of an acquaintance (Dougray Scott as Trevanny) for something to do - this unfortunate man is not only terminally ill, struggling in a picture framing business that is failing, desperate and broke, but is now also soon to become embroiled in something else way over his head.  An insult against him is overheard by Tom himself, which puts the destination in overdrive.  Now,  Tom must calmly exact revenge, but in doing so, he (Malkovich) ends up cleaning up his own mess, in a curious twist of undiscovered inner character -  but that's entirely OK by him, because it's the challenge of wits, talent and attention to detail that is food and drink to a man like him.This thing is unquestionably a good evening's entertainment if you enjoy psychotic thrillers.",4,"""Sticks and Stones.......""",1342569600,"07 18, 2012",2012,1766,"['words', 'will', 'never', 'hurt', '.Obviously', 'one', 'ever', 'read', 'nursery', 'rhyme', 'Tom', 'Ripley', 'played', 'hilt', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'Words', 'were', 'exactly', 'needed', 'catalyst', 'set', 'off', 'major', 'event', 'tale', 'debauchery', 'twisted', 'social', 'behavior', 'dishonest', 'dangerous', 'fencing', 'phony', 'master', 'art', 'dealings', 'host', 'other', 'crimes', 'are', 'somehow', 'bound', 'questionable', 'code', 'honor', 'midst', 'few', 'select', 'people', 'pop', 'up', 'needing', 'murdered', 'presenting', 'dilemma', 'sorts', 'Ripley', 'who', 'picky', 'whom', 'kill', 'what', 'reason.John', 'Malkovich', 'splendid', 'Tom', 'Ripley', 'calm', 'brilliant', 'sociopath', 'who', 'child', 'bride', 'pet', 'when', 'quiet', 'time', 'partnered', 'crime', 'seedy', 'crude', 'uneducated', 'cunning', 'common', 'thief', 'whom', 'far', 'beneath', 'own', 'social', 'standing', 'can', 'barely', 'stand', 'be', 'same', 'room', 'business', 'business', 'One', 'night', 'fateful', 'invitation', 'Tom', 'home', 'acquaintance', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'Trevanny', 'something', 'do', 'unfortunate', 'man', 'not', 'only', 'terminally', 'ill', 'struggling', 'picture', 'framing', 'business', 'failing', 'desperate', 'broke', 'now', 'also', 'soon', 'become', 'embroiled', 'something', 'else', 'way', 'head', 'insult', 'overheard', 'Tom', 'destination', 'overdrive', 'Now', 'Tom', 'must', 'calmly', 'exact', 'revenge', 'doing', 'so', 'Malkovich', 'up', 'cleaning', 'up', 'own', 'mess', 'curious', 'twist', 'undiscovered', 'inner', 'character', 'entirely', 'OK', 'challenge', 'wits', 'talent', 'attention', 'detail', 'food', 'drink', 'man', 'him.This', 'thing', 'unquestionably', 'good', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'enjoy', 'psychotic', 'thrillers']",Ripley's Game

More than anything else, your reaction to this film will depend on your opinion of John Malkovich: if you think he's expressionless, characterless, and generally boring/annoying, stay away.  But for us JM fans who consider him brilliant, expressive, and captivating, I say this is his absolute peak.The plot is quite well-done, simple but engrossing, nothing torturous here.  In fact, one can take in the movie without paying any attention to the central capers whatsoever -- there's so much to enjoy all the way through.  Besides the suave JM, we have Ray Winstone (always solid) and the girl from ""My Own Private Idaho"" to charm us from start to finish.

I found this story to be THAT enjoyable....and then some.The lead character, Ripley, is presented as a well-aged version of the sociopathic con artist played by Matt Damon in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"".  As played by the inimitable John Malkovich, this older, wiser Ripley is infinitely more sophisticated, sly, treacherous, and fascinating. He lives in a wonderful Italian villa with a gorgeous wife/mistress who knows and embraces his true nature. When publicly insulted by a neighbor, played by Dougray Scott, he initiates a plot to gain revenge, ultimately turning the innocent man into a hired killer who is then tortured by his own conscience....a punishment that could never affect the consciousless, sociopathic Mr. Ripley.Malkovich is a unique actor, never content to merely show up and speak his lines convincingly, he actually BECOMES the character...and every devilish smile, lick of the lips, flash of anger, etc. becomes an expressive action by the character, not by the actor. He is so completely suited to this role that it is impossible to envision anyone else playing the part.The dialog is wonderful....complex, intellectually stimulating, and natural. Indeed, some of the comments on the nature (and absence) of conscience and guilt achieve the level of fine literature. Conversations are generally riveting, the humor is generally very dark, and the suspense reaches Hitchcockian levels. As the Scott character, who is dying of leukemia, sinks deeper and deeper into the depravity of his hapless plight, he actually begins to seek, rather than fear, death.This is a very sophisticated, emotionally involving story that will appeal strongly to mature viewers. It never received the attention it deserved, and ranks among the best of the ""undiscovered"" movies.

795094,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00018D40O,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","The story of Patricia Highsmith's unique character Tom Ripley (which was once filmed as ""The American Friend"" by Wim Wenders) is taken up again this time by Liliana Cavani. John Malkovich plays the rich, nihilistic hero living in Italy who, with a help from a sleazy guy named Reeves (Ray Winstone) his former partner in crime, makes Jonathan, an ailing picture framer (Dougray Scott), a contract killer hired for them.The film's situation is unusual, even impossible, especially when you know why Ripley is attracted to this far-fetched crime. And you surely need suspense of disbelief if you really want to enjoy this curiously intriguing thriller. Wait until one suspenseful, darkly funny sequence set in the night train in Germany. Things take unexpected turns more than once, leading up to the conclusion that is as enigmatic as the protagonist himself.The film is tour-de-force of the star John Malkovich as Ripley with a calm voice, chilling and calculating, whose complex personality always baffles us. You may dislike him (why not), or you may be attracted to him, but either way he never bores us. Some may find undercurrent theme (like homosexuality) in the apparently implausible storyline. Some may think the film is a very dark comedy. This beautifully-shot film remains ambiguous; ambiguity is part of the film's essence, and its charm.This is a film you will either love or hate. Considering the rather neglected status of the film when it was originally released, opinions seem tilted toward ""hate."" I understand that because this is a thriller where the idea of good and evil means nothing.

Is Ripley's game getting rid of the tasteless, crude European played with aplomb by Ray Winstone--who you see Malkovich's Ripley has great problems with as they run a game on an art deal in the beginning? Or is Ripley trying to gracefully get even for the dissing he got at his neighbor the leukemic picture framer's soiree? Tom Ripley has no taste? Indeed. That's akin to saying that all Americans are cowboys... Well, suffice it to say that Ripley and the European made an offer the picture framer could not refuse...a tidy sum and a second opinion given by some specialists in Berlin. The first offing goes pretty well, except for the blood stained glass at the natural museum....however, now the Russian Mafia will come after someone if another execution isn't done. The poor picture framer sees himself getting deeper and deeper and just as he's to do the second one, master improvisionist Ripley arrives. Then an odd fellowship develop between Ripley and the picture framer. And when the movie ends, you really aren't sure that Ripley has gained some type of redemption or not....but, he *does* end up getting away with murder, so to speak.
