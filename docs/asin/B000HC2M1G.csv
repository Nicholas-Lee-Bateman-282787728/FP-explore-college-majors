1012114,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000HC2M1G,A Customer,"[29, 30]","With it's incredibly literate screenplay and its fine performances from its cast, Fixing Frank shows what can happen when egos, deceit, falsehood and one-upmanship can blindside a devoted and seemingly committed love relationship. Based on Ken Hanes off Broadway play, Fixing Frank deals with some provocative issues - the ethics of psychology, the origins of sexuality, and the quack science of conversion therapy.The script abounds with a type of intellectual grandiosity, which is very rare in movies today. The film begins as freelance journalist Frank Johnston (Andrew Elvis Miller) is visiting psychologist Dr. Arthur Apsey (Dan Butler). Apsey claims that he can ""cure"" gay men of their same-sex desires and make them straight. Frank's psychotherapist partner Dr. Jonathan Baldwin (Paul Provenza) has seen the results of Apsey's work - he's worked with some of Apsey's patients - and is outraged at the damage that Apsey is doing.Jonathan has asked Frank to go undercover to write and article about him and hopefully expose Apsey as the dangerous fraud that he is.  The two lovers, however, have vastly underestimated Apsey's intellectual brilliance, and his penchant for twisting words and point of view to suit his own perverted agenda. He begins to attack Frank emotionally, gradually wearing him down, until the man begins to truly doubt himself.Apsey eventually catches Frank in a series of lies and deceits, which leads to Frank ""outing"" himself as an investigative reporter, and stalling Baldwin's plan to file documented professional charges against Apsey. The two psychologists enter into a strange cat-and-mouse game using the poor Frank as a porn between them. As Frank becomes putty in Apsey's hands, he truly begins to question his sexuality whilst also questioning his marriage to his beloved Jonathan.The stakes are high, as all three men must navigate the treacherous waters of deceit and dishonesty. Jonathan is wrong even foolish, not to mention unethical, in what he asks of Frank to expose Apsey, yet Frank is also imprudent to allow himself to be so manipulated by Apsey's methods whom Jonathan has nicknamed Frankenstein. Also, Jonathan has deeply underestimated his lover's capacity for truth and his lack of suitability for the job. But who in the end is more manipulative, the therapist or the lover?Miller, Butler and Provenza are all perfect in their roles - indeed they are all actors I've never heard of and Miller's portrayal of this insecure writer torn between two strong men is especially supple and compassionate. But the film's ultimate strength is its bitterly astute screenplay, which just oozes provocativeness. Although some viewers may find it a bit overly talky, and sometimes the erudite and witty repartee is a bit too contrived for the screen, Michael Selditch's direction is always tight and competent.Be warned - this is heavy material and subject matter is probably going to make a lot of people uncomfortable. The topical subject matter of ""reverse therapy,"" the scientifically unproven  - and much detested in the gay community - the method of transforming homosexual into heterosexual behavior, is indeed prickly. But the ultimate success of the film is that it addresses much deeper concerns, of loyalty and trust and commitment and how one gay couple's relationship is really tested to the max.

For me, I found myself wandering through the first part of the film wondering exactly where this story was headed.The story just starts, and you need to pay careful attention to understand the relationship between the 3 characters.  All 3 stars (Dan Butler, Andrew Elvis Miller, Paul Provenza) are excellent in their roles!  At moments, Butler and Miller capture the screen.At first, I did NOT like some of the filming techniques, at all!  I got use to it, maybe half way through the film.  This is a personal taste, and you'll either like the style, or hate it.  Rather then lay out the premise of the film in the beginning, the viewer must watch and learn to understand how the 3 characters develop.  The film uses flash-forward sequences, which at times were annoying.Storyline: Dr Apsey (Butler) plays a psychologist who is believed by many to convert gay man to straight.  ""Frank"", for whom the film is titled, is setup by his boyfriend, Dr Baldwin, to play a patient who desires to be ""fixed"" (i.e. made straight).  Frank is a writer, and intends to tell the story. About a 1/3 of the way into the film, things take a dramatically different direction.  At this point, only each individual watching the film can determine what they consider to be ""right or wrong"".You should try and watch the film with friends, and be prepared for a lively discussion afterwards.  Personally, no one could convert me to be someone other then who I am.  But the film raises questions, that MAY not be easy for everyone to answer.There are a few exceptional portions of the film, and the second half is clearly better then the first.  The film is occasionally slow, mostly in the beginning.  You'll need to watch it carefully to stay focused on the story.  The end result is an intense film that deals with the issue of ""conversion therapy"".  Again, I already have my personal opinions, but you may find yourself leaning to both sides of the fence after watching ""Fixing Frank"".",4,Intense Storyline - Great Cast - Controversial Topic,1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,2083,"['was', 'excellent', 'film', 'However', ""'ll"", 'need', 'get', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'grabbing', 'found', 'wandering', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'wondering', 'exactly', 'where', 'story', 'was', 'headed.The', 'story', 'just', 'need', 'pay', 'careful', 'attention', 'understand', 'relationship', '3', 'characters', '3', 'stars', 'Dan', 'Butler', 'Andrew', 'Elvis', 'Miller', 'Paul', 'Provenza', 'are', 'excellent', 'roles', 'moments', 'Butler', 'Miller', 'capture', 'screen.At', 'first', 'did', 'NOT', 'filming', 'techniques', 'got', 'use', 'maybe', 'way', 'film', 'personal', 'taste', ""'ll"", 'style', 'hate', 'then', 'lay', 'out', 'premise', 'film', 'beginning', 'viewer', 'must', 'watch', 'learn', 'understand', 'how', '3', 'characters', 'develop', 'film', 'flash-forward', 'sequences', 'times', 'were', 'annoying.Storyline', 'Dr', 'Apsey', 'Butler', 'psychologist', 'who', 'believed', 'many', 'convert', 'gay', 'man', 'straight', 'Frank', 'whom', 'film', 'titled', 'setup', 'boyfriend', 'Dr', 'Baldwin', 'play', 'patient', 'who', 'be', 'fixed', 'i.e', 'made', 'straight', 'Frank', 'writer', 'tell', 'story', '1/3', 'way', 'film', 'things', 'take', 'dramatically', 'different', 'direction', 'point', 'only', 'individual', 'watching', 'film', 'can', 'determine', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'right', 'wrong', '.You', 'should', 'try', 'watch', 'film', 'friends', 'be', 'prepared', 'lively', 'discussion', 'afterwards', 'Personally', 'one', 'could', 'convert', 'be', 'someone', 'other', 'then', 'who', 'am', 'film', 'questions', 'MAY', 'not', 'be', 'easy', 'everyone', 'are', 'few', 'exceptional', 'portions', 'film', 'second', 'half', 'clearly', 'better', 'then', 'first', 'film', 'occasionally', 'slow', 'mostly', 'beginning', ""'ll"", 'need', 'watch', 'carefully', 'stay', 'focused', 'story', 'end', 'result', 'intense', 'film', 'deals', 'issue', 'conversion', 'therapy', 'Again', 'already', 'have', 'personal', 'opinions', 'may', 'find', 'leaning', 'sides', 'fence', 'watching', 'Fixing', 'Frank']",Fixing Frank

1012117,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000HC2M1G,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","FIXING FRANK is somewhat of a rarity these days - a film well made form script to production that puts a hot topic on the table and challenges the viewer to think, all the while providing a very entertaining movie experience.  The work began as a play by Ken Hayes who also adapted his play for the screen and while the 'opening up' of a stage play on the cinematic format is successful, in many way the dialogue feels very theatrical and the method of production stagy.  That fact may annoy some viewers: for this viewer it worked, allowing us to here the superb script delivered in its entirety without frosting it with unnecessary visuals.Credit director Michael Selditch for the creative approach to this filmed play. He keeps the story moving and integrated and draws exceptionally fine performances from his superb cast.  In essence this is a three person film - two apposing therapists who are at opposite poles of dealing with the concept that being gay is an immutable inherited trait versus the possibility that with therapy the gay behavior can be changed to heterosexual behavior if the patient desires that 'change'.Frank (Andrew Elvis Miller), a writer who is in the process of exposing a therapist Dr. Aspey (Dan Butler) who claims he can 'cure' gay men - at least according to Frank's lover Dr. Baldwin (Paul Provenza), an activist gay therapist.  Frank, coached by Baldwin,  has sessions with Aspey with the idea of trapping him into revealing his 'damage' to gay patients who have complained to Baldwin of Aspey's techniques.  But what Frank discovers is a that Aspey deals with choices and changes on a strictly therapeutic angle, not basing claims for 'cures'  for a lifestyle he does not condemn.  In the process of the 'therapy' sessions, Frank grows into his own identity - a fact that alters his relationship with Baldwin and opens many closed doors of thought for all three characters - and us.The actors are all excellent: one wonders if they played these roles on the stage.  The intermingling of the sessions with conversations outside of sessions is additive and while many may object to the theatrical use of placing all three actors on the screen simultaneously when a 'session; is in progress, the format works well in allowing the script to be heard and maintain its punch.  This is a thinkers' movie, the concepts are controversial and may find some viewers anger points, but as a film it works exceptionally well.

This is the best movie I've seen in a long, long time, and I've seen lots of good ones in the past year.
