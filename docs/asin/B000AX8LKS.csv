933975,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B000AX8LKS,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[2, 3]","Europeans seem to have a lot more fun with sex than Americans do, and filmmaker Tinto Brass, inCheeky! (Producers Cut, Unrated, English Version)takes a simple plot (a beautiful, playful Venetian girl waits impatiently in London for her boyfriend to join her), and rewrites it into a sexy voyage of discovery, as Carla (Yuliya Mayarchuk) is seduced by an array of English characters, particularly a lesbian real estate agent, and her amorous ex-husband, while her boyfriend, a continent away, seethes in comic jealousy, knowing Carla, with her kindness, good heart, and raging hormones, simply can't say 'no'...In the hands of an American director, the cast would be 'plastic surgery perfect', the seductions would be more aerobic than erotic, and passion would be perfunctory, rather than spontaneous. Brass prefers natural beauty (flaws are what makes beauty 'real'), sex is sweaty, intimate, and joyful, and appreciating the opposite sex isn't something to feel guilty about, but to treasure. Truthfully, ""Cheeky!"" was almost sexual overload, for me, and I couldn't sit through the film in one sitting (it is the sensual equivalent of eating too many sweet chocolates...you get a major sugar rush!)

933976,A2DGFOT7FB05WY,B000AX8LKS,BGP,"[9, 16]","Being both a fan of foreign film and a firm believer in the aesthetic appeal of a well-shaped derri&egrave;re, I have, of course, known of Tinto Brass for some time. Unfortunately, if Cheeky! (originally released in Italy as Trasgredire) is to be considered representative, there can be no questioning the fact that the director's work falls far short of even the most minimal set of expectations, let alone the hype. The film's script is vapid, the acting is terrible (let's not even mention the fact that the film's Ukrainian star, Yuliya Mayarchuk, is equipped with a voice that could--and almost certainly would--kill any movie), and, to top it all off, Brass' style of direction is, at its best, contentedly terrible. What we have here, in other words, is neither clever nor erotic, but, instead, unabashed high budget soft porn marketed as art. For the record, I have nothing against films of such a nature; I simply find them boring, and see little point in pursuing or wasting my time on what is, essentially, campy ""adult entertainment lite."" For some, Cheeky! could very well encapsulate all of the best features of that which is cheesy and risqu&eacute;, but I don't see it.

933977,A2WHQZXGP0DOYS,B000AX8LKS,Buddy S,"[26, 27]","Carla (played by Russian born actress Yuliya Mayarchuk) lives in Venice and is madly in love with her boyfriend Matteo (Jarno Berardi.)  When the film begins, Carla recently arrived in London and is working as a receptionist at a London hotel.  The couple plans that Matteo will travel to England where he will join Carla in a short period of time.  Implementing this plan, however, becomes problematic - - First, Carla is incredibly beautiful, is easily aroused sexually, and has a penchant for dressing provocatively.  The first time we see her, while walking through Hyde Park, she is wearing a see-through skirt, with no underwear -- at her next appearance in public, she wears unbelievably brief short shorts.  It is therefore not surprising that nearly everyone she encounters attempts to seduce her.  This includes her female real estate agent and the agent's former husband.  At first, Carla resists, but ultimately she succumbs.  Later, however, she makes clear to the female realtor that she is interested in males, not women.Meanwhile, back in Venice, Matteo stumbles on evidence which suggests that Carla was unfaithful even before she traveled to London.  He argues with Carla during a phone conversation and calls off his trip to London.  Then, after reconsidering the matter, he appears unannounced at Carla's flat in London to bring matters to a head.  This film examines the question of whether infidelity by a female partner, and then lying about it, can be beneficial to a relationship.  I will not reveal the answer here to avoid spoiling your potential enjoyment of the storyline.But alas, this film is not really about relationships - - it is soft core pornography and is focused on sex.  Be aware, however, that this film is about as hard as soft core can go without crossing the line.  No actual penetration is visible, but both female and male genitalia are shown throughout the film.The movie is shot on ""film"" and the production values are high.  It appears to have been filmed on location in both London and Venice.  The transfer to DVD and the DVD sound (two channel stereo) are also very good.Carla spends a very large part of the film wearing little or no clothing and the camera studies her perfect face and body in great detail.  There is also a bevy of additional attractive females appearing throughout the film in various stages of undress and totally nude on multiple occasions.  As the cover of the DVD case suggests, the director Tinto Brass pays special attention to the female derriere in his camera shots.Watching Yuliya Mayarchuk (Carla) alone is worth the price of this DVD.  Combining this with a credible semblance of a plot, high production values, and wall to wall nudity gives this film a five star rating, in my opinion.  My only complaint is that the film is in Italian, with English subtitles, and reading the dialogue, which often proceeds at a fast clip, sometimes makes it difficult to keep up with the visual action.  However, this is a DVD and the rewind button is designed to handle this kind of problem.",5,A Tale About Tails,1186012800,"08 2, 2007",2007,3062,"['Carla', 'played', 'Russian', 'born', 'actress', 'Yuliya', 'Mayarchuk', 'Venice', 'madly', 'love', 'boyfriend', 'Matteo', 'Jarno', 'Berardi', 'When', 'film', 'Carla', 'recently', 'arrived', 'London', 'working', 'receptionist', 'London', 'hotel', 'couple', 'Matteo', 'will', 'travel', 'England', 'where', 'will', 'join', 'Carla', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'Implementing', 'plan', 'however', 'problematic', 'First', 'Carla', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'easily', 'aroused', 'sexually', 'penchant', 'dressing', 'provocatively', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'walking', 'Hyde', 'Park', 'wearing', 'see-through', 'skirt', 'underwear', 'next', 'appearance', 'public', 'unbelievably', 'brief', 'short', 'shorts', 'therefore', 'not', 'surprising', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'attempts', 'seduce', 'female', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'agent', 'former', 'husband', 'first', 'Carla', 'ultimately', 'Later', 'however', 'clear', 'female', 'realtor', 'interested', 'males', 'not', 'back', 'Venice', 'Matteo', 'evidence', 'Carla', 'was', 'unfaithful', 'even', 'traveled', 'London', 'Carla', 'phone', 'conversation', 'off', 'trip', 'London', 'Then', 'reconsidering', 'matter', 'unannounced', 'Carla', 'flat', 'London', 'bring', 'matters', 'head', 'film', 'question', 'infidelity', 'female', 'partner', 'then', 'lying', 'can', 'be', 'beneficial', 'relationship', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'answer', 'here', 'avoid', 'spoiling', 'potential', 'enjoyment', 'storyline.But', 'alas', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'relationships', 'soft', 'core', 'pornography', 'focused', 'sex', 'Be', 'aware', 'however', 'film', 'as', 'hard', 'soft', 'core', 'can', 'go', 'crossing', 'line', 'actual', 'penetration', 'visible', 'female', 'male', 'genitalia', 'are', 'shown', 'film.The', 'movie', 'shot', 'film', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'high', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'location', 'London', 'Venice', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'sound', 'two', 'channel', 'stereo', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good.Carla', 'very', 'large', 'part', 'film', 'wearing', 'little', 'clothing', 'camera', 'studies', 'perfect', 'face', 'body', 'great', 'detail', 'also', 'bevy', 'additional', 'attractive', 'females', 'appearing', 'film', 'various', 'stages', 'undress', 'totally', 'nude', 'multiple', 'occasions', 'cover', 'DVD', 'case', 'director', 'Tinto', 'Brass', 'special', 'attention', 'female', 'derriere', 'camera', 'shots.Watching', 'Yuliya', 'Mayarchuk', 'Carla', 'alone', 'price', 'DVD', 'Combining', 'credible', 'semblance', 'plot', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'wall', 'wall', 'nudity', 'film', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'opinion', 'only', 'complaint', 'film', 'Italian', 'English', 'subtitles', 'reading', 'dialogue', 'often', 'fast', 'clip', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'keep', 'up', 'visual', 'action', 'However', 'DVD', 'rewind', 'button', 'designed', 'handle', 'kind', 'problem']",N/A

""Artist/Designer/Kibitzer""","[93, 106]","Cheeky, released in Europe by the name Trasgredire, is a good name for this farcical romp because there is a strong emphasis on cheeks. Women's that is and not the facial kind.The feature opens with our heroine(?), Carla (Yuliya Mayarchuk) briskly strolling though Hyde Park, observing amorous couples in various states of passion, (something I seem to miss on my jaunts through a park) when a typical flasher opens his trench coat and exhibits his faux penis to Carla. Was she shocked? Did she run? No, she smiled and lifted up her flimsy miniskirt and a flashed her beaver back at him. In a way it was funny as it was meant to be but it gives you an idea about the inanity of the movie.The PlotCarla has moved from her home of Italy, for some undisclosed reason, to London. Her boyfriend Matteo (Jarno Berardi) is supposed to join her and she needs to find somewhere to live. She encounters a real estate agent named Moira (Francesca Nunzi) a lesbian who fancies her and provides a huge apartment for two pounds a month or something like that. In the meantime Matteo's good friend tells him that women always fool around when they are away and gets him jealous.The StoryMeanwhile, Moira is after Carla. They play around a little but Carla draws the line. She tells Moira she likes men. She likes co*ks. Afterward she goes to a party with Moira and meets and has sex with Moira's ex-husband. No, I didn't get it either - a lesbian having a husband. For those into randy scenes this party was a gem, with the exposed bottoms of several women lined up on a couch and a couple other explicit genitalia shots. I do believe the all male shots were done with fake paraphernalia though.Things aren't going to well between Carla and Matteo. After discovering a photo of Carla laying in sand in the buff he flies all the way to London to confront with the picture. She lays the story on him that it was her boyfriend but Matteo discovers that she was seeing the other guy at the same time as he. He then demands if she has any other secrets and she tells him how she had sex with his friend.Disgusted he leaves and takes a walk through the same Hyde Park in which the movie opened and he also sees amorous couples and passion. (gotta go to Hyde Park) Watching one amorous couple he discovers he isn't the only voyeur. Another man is watching who informs Matteo that the woman is his wife. Matteo the seems to have an epiphany and goes back to Carla. He tells her it's alright if she wants to cheat on him, as long as she's open about it. The End.I did have a problem with the last part but I didn't watch the movie for the story. Let's face it the story is incidental to the nudity and action.ConclusionIt's hard to give a bad or even average rating to a movie that you watched a second time. On reflection, it wasn't very good. The story was lacking and the acting was lackluster yet it seemed redeemed somewhat in my eyes by it's audacity and incredibly naughtiness.Ultimately, it seemed like the movie was created to showcase and built around the perky, attractive Russian star - Yuliya Mayarchuk. Not a bad subject to build a softcore movie around. Yuliya is svelte yet shapely and looks great without her clothes. One of the highlights of the film for me was when Yuliya, Who has a strong resemblance to Reese Whitherspoon, performed a reverse strip tease.Cheeky was the first Tinto Brass movie I've seen since I viewed the raunchy Caligula. It was dubbed in English but the European version Trasgredire, is in a foreign language with or without subtitles.Tinto brass makes a couple cameo appearances in the movie. He may have even beet the flasher in the beginning. The flasher was wearing a Groucho Marx style mask.Like I said. It's not a particularly good movie but there is something there that grabbed me.

I'm not sure anyone can define porn anymore.  It depicts the human condition as only the Italians can do.  The actresses are beautiful to look at and I couldn't detect the sordidness that pervades much of todays porn output.  Perhaps it's because there isn't a screenwriter involved who tries to weave in a meaningful plot. (It does have a bit of a plot, but it's so unobtrusive that it's almost unnoticable). This film doesn't really need a plot because it is so joyful. I know that I'm glad I have it now and I wish I could find women like the ones in this film here in the beanfields of Indiana to pose for me.

If you are the kind of person who likes it...then you are in for a treat.""Cheeky"" is a pretty typical Tinto Brass flick.  There is enough of a story stitched together to give his cast something to do.  In this case, a buxom Italian girl Carla leaves behind her boyfriend Matteo to rent an apartment in London.  Of course, her new landlady is a seductive lesbian and all sorts of men give her the eye, and Carla just can't seem to say no.  Hijinks ensue.  Matteo gets a whiff of the goings-on in London, and comes in for a jealous rage but soon finds that life offers other pleasures than jealousy and anger.One of the things I like about Brass's films is how he brings a light, playfulness to sexuality that is refreshing and fun.  No dark shadows and intense power-plays, this is just happy people enjoying themselves, and having fun the way nature intended.  All of the gals here show their stuff here, front and back, up and down, and Brass's camera likes to linger on the good bits.  They guys don't get to be as free, using prosthetics instead of the real thing, which is odd but a signature of Brass's films.My favorite scene of the movie: Carla is drifting through Hyde Park in London, watching young lovers very publicly going at it, when she comes along a man in a long trench coat who whips it open to expose himself to the pretty young woman.  Carla smiles, and promptly returns the favor by hoisting up her skirt and showing him that she has nothing on underneath.
