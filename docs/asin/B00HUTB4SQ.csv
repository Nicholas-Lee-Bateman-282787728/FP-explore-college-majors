1692428,A106YXO3EHVD3J,B00HUTB4SQ,"DR SHOCK ""MR. KIA RETURNS! ;-b""","[2, 2]","I grew up watching this cute and funny show. A show about a recently widowed father and his young son. The chemistry between Bixby and Cruz are really what make this show such a treat. Of course the supporting cast is also good with Mrs. Livingston the Asian housekeeper, Uncle Norman and Tina two friends of the two. Even the dated late 60's theme doesn't hurt this show because the real values haven't changed or at least they shouldn't have.The show holds up surprisingly well and all 24 first season episodes are here on this four disc set. They look quite good too and it doesn't appear that anything is cut out as they run around 26 minutes each. The theme song is also unforgettable and is an important part of the lead in for each episode. Nilsson wrote and performs the catchy number and he adds variations of the theme throughout the episodes.This is the  weakest season only because Eddie seemed to be growing up fast, but there is plenty to like about season 3.If you've been looking for this show look no further as this is about as good as it's going to get. WB released the other two seasons, It's a bit expensive, but I really enjoyed seeing this again. ......people let me tell ya 'bout my best friend!",5,THIRD AND FINAL SEASON HAS BEEN RELEASED!

1692429,A153D7I3HEB9KV,B00HUTB4SQ,Jennifer B.,"[2, 2]","Courtship of Eddie's Father was my favorite television show to watch in the early 1970's.  The friendship between father and son seemed very natural and genuine in the show and I always loved to listen to Mrs. Livingston speak to Eddie and share stories of Japan.  This was a charming show that had a simple message, love for family.  I hoped for a long time they would release this show to DVD and began to doubt it would ever happen.  I urge any fans of the show to purchase all 3 seasons on DVD before they disappear.  This show is one of those gems of the past you want to treasure and keep in your DVD collection.",5,Favorite TV show growing up,1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,618,"['Courtship', 'Eddie', 'Father', 'was', 'favorite', 'television', 'show', 'watch', 'early', '1970', 'friendship', 'father', 'son', 'seemed', 'very', 'natural', 'genuine', 'show', 'always', 'loved', 'listen', 'Mrs.', 'Livingston', 'speak', 'Eddie', 'share', 'stories', 'Japan', 'was', 'charming', 'show', 'had', 'simple', 'message', 'love', 'family', 'hoped', 'long', 'time', 'would', 'release', 'show', 'DVD', 'began', 'doubt', 'would', 'ever', 'happen', 'urge', 'fans', 'show', 'purchase', '3', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'disappear', 'show', 'one', 'gems', 'past', 'want', 'treasure', 'keep', 'DVD', 'collection']",The Courtship of Eddie's Father: The Complete Third Season

Season three (and the final year) of this adorable TV series finds Bill Bixby continuing as the faithful guardian and single (widowed) father of the young, inquisitive freckled faced ""Eddie Corbett"" (played by Brandon Cruz), who is now showing signs of growing up. The episode ""My Son, My Artist"" takes on an adult theme when Tom Corbett attends an art class involving a 'live' nude model and naturally, Eddie's curiosity is piqued by his father's drawings - the subject matter is handled in good taste. And of course, the series and household wouldn't be complete without the ingratiating presence of ""Mrs. Livingston"" who was played by the soft spoken Miyoshi Umeki.The picture quality on this season is very good on this three disc set.Another classic completed thanks to the Warner Bros Archives!
