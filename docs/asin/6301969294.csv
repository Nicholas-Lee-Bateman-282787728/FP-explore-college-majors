I haven't laughed so much in a long, long time, but of course I'm just part of the mob.  Anyway, here is a list of what you get for your nickel in this film:1) Ayn Rand's heavy handed screen play.2) Wooden Acting by Gary Cooper, Patricia Neal, and Raymond Massey.3) A great imitation of Vladimir Lenin in the Ellsworth Toohey character played by actor Robert Douglas.4)  Patrica Neal as Ice Princess.  Anytime she comes on the screen you will be singing the old Foreigner tune ""She's cold as ice.  She's willing to sacrifice our love.""5) A film in black and white, and I mean black and white.  Everything in this story is black and white.6) Gary Cooper's maniacal little grin right before ravishing the Dominique Francon character played by Patricia Neal.  He even has the grin when he is thinking about ravishing, and possibly raping by the look on the character Howard Roork's face, Dominique.7) Dominque's husband, Gail Wynand played by Raymond Massey,  pronouncing her name Dominic.  (A little homoeroticism going on here?)8) Straight lines and lots of them.9) At the end of the movie a giant phallic symbol looking of a skyscraper and Patricia Neal almost in orgasm as she rides up the construction elevator to meet her new sex partner, Gary Cooper.10)  Finally, you will find out that all that matters in life is Architecture.  (Maybe, Art Vandalay was right?)The only reason this movie rates 2 stars is that the direction of this film by King Vidor is actually quite good.  And considering he had to work under that harpy, Ayn Rand, he should have gotten a medal for martyrdom.  The screen play and acting rate ZERO stars.  Well maybe a 1/2 star for comic relief.Until I saw this movie I thought Ayn Rand and Objec!ivists in general had no sense of humor.

Is Roark doomed to fail? A telephone call brings business, but they want a change to follow popular taste. ""Can you beat that?"" Mr. Wynand wants a new building, he gives the public what it wants.

There is the question of ""self-sacrifice"". ""Public opinion is what I make it.""

Rand attempts to appropriate Nietzsche (Roark = Nietzschean superman) and place him in an American context.

He is an individualist, and since this is Ayn Rand's book, an objectivist. The whole thing would work a little better for me if I liked his designs, but they represented radical modernism in 1948, which was the point of the story. I just don't happen to like the sleek modernist buildings most of the time.Anyway, the point is not whether or not the audience likes his designs. We are to understand that his designs are original, completely original, and that he will not compromise them. And in fact, the compromises offered are sufficiently horrible to make the point. A man of genius knows that a building, or a sculpture or a book or whatever, must have its own internal integrity; it must function as a whole, not a conglomeration of disassociated parts. At one point his proposed sleek modern building (model) is given a Greek temple face toward the street, while the rest of the building remains a large block. It's thoroughly disgusting, and he will have none of it.So rather than compromise, he goes to work in a stone quarry in New England, where a wealthy and sophisticated young woman played by Patricia Neal (who had a off-screen love affair with Cooper as well as the on-screen one) notices him and makes a play for him. Finally, he is called away to design a building the way he wants to, and at the grand opening of the building, she shows up. She is introduced to Roark, and we discover that she never even learned the name of the stone cutter she seduced.For reasons that are too complicated to spell out here, she marries her former boss, an older man played by Raymond Massey. Massey asks Roark to design his home, saying it is to be a temple to his beloved wife. (Remember, Roark loves her too.) Roark goes from one success to another, but there's a snag.An old school friend, a third-rate architect who admits he never did anything original and copied from Roark all the time, asks him to take over the designing of a housing project which is supposed to be for low-cost housing. Roark stipulates that he will design it and let the third-rate guy take the credit and the fees, but only if it is built exactly the way he designs it, with no alteration at all. His old friend agrees, Roark designs it, then goes on vacation while it is built. Predictably, the wimpy third-rate architect gives in to the demands that it be modified, and the results are truly horrible. The thing looks like what it is: a design made by a committee.

To make ends meet during lean times he gets a day job at a rock quarry.  There he meats his match and bets literally wiped by the boss's daughter Dominique Francon (Patricia Neal.) they both seem to know more of the world than most people do. She works for a newspaper and to punisher self for falling in love with Howard marries her boss Gail Wynand (Raymond Massy.)  This does not denture Howard form building Gail and Dominique their dream house. Eventually getting the chance of a lifetime to build low-income housing through another architect, he jumps at the chance as long as it means only doing it the Howard Roark way. Watch the movie to find out what happens and why he is such a stickler for the work of the individual.You can argue about film versus book until the cows come home. You could say, ""Let's make this with Helen Mirren and Mel Gibson.""  You can even have Turner colonize it. Well folks, it is not going to happen; so do not waste your time wishing, and look at this movie.This is a pretty faithful summary (as opposed to adaptation). In that, you get the essence of the book with a few saved speeches. All the actors get their point over to you: this includes Gary Cooper as Howard Roark (he purposely looks stoic and amused) and Patricia Neal as Dominique (looking frustrated and aloof.)The scenes, black and white with exaggerated camera angles, portray the story very well. The Frank Lloyd Wright architecture adds to the time period.

Marold""","[13, 20]","One of the hot topics in the field of asthetics is the extent to which a work of art is improved by 'truth' or cheapened by falsity. Does right and wrong, true or false, have any effect at all of the artistic value of a creative work of art. I believe this movie and the novel by Ayn Rand on which it is based is one of the finest case studies for the position that the truth of an artistic work's intellectual message has a profound effect on the artistic value of the work. Virtually the only other cinematic work about which I might say this is Leni Riefenstall's famous documentary, 'Triumph of the Will'.My point is based on the fact that author Rand takes a reasonable position of artistic integrity and twists it into a form which simply makes no sense when applied to the discipline of architecture. The abberation would disappear, in my mind, if Gary Cooper were a sculptor, poet, painter, or even playwright. If he were Michaelangelo doing the Sistine Chapel ceiling, the issue starts to get really fuzzy, as he is creating a decoration for a specific patron to fill a very specific function.What makes the wrongheadedness of the character Roarke's individualism so apparant is that it is played out in the world of architecture, where almost all buildings are done for a specific client, which, for commercial buildings, is almost always a corporation with lots of different opinions and needs to satisfy. The simplest case is that of a family with a husband, wife, 2.3 children and a dog looking for a house. You need to balance financial resources against the number of bedrooms, the number of closets, and the fenced in yard for Fido.If you think this is hard, multiply this by 1000 when it comes to building a mall or a highrise.The thing which makes this such a good case study of art and reason and right and wrong is the fact that the director, King Vidor and the principle actors, Gary Cooper, Patricia Neal, and Raymond Massey do such a good job with the script, the blocking, and the cinematography. With Massey's character as a newspaper magnate, one is immediately inclined to make comparisons with 'Citizen Kane'.Unfortunately, the wrongheadedness of Rand's political and personal philosophy seriously compromises the whole film. Oddly, Cooper's character has a remarkable albeit superficial resemblence to Frank Lloyd Wright's career, which I am sure adds much verisimillatude to the story.But, from what little I know of Wright's career, he was largely successful from the outset and often compromised on major design points.I recommend this movie as much for its wrongheadedness as for its artistic value.",4,A case study of the effect of ideology on art,1126310400,"09 10, 2005",2005,2632,"['One', 'hot', 'topics', 'field', 'asthetics', 'extent', 'work', 'art', 'improved', ""'truth"", 'cheapened', 'falsity', 'Does', 'right', 'wrong', 'true', 'false', 'have', 'effect', 'artistic', 'value', 'creative', 'work', 'art', 'believe', 'movie', 'novel', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'based', 'one', 'finest', 'case', 'studies', 'position', 'truth', 'artistic', 'work', 'intellectual', 'message', 'profound', 'effect', 'artistic', 'value', 'work', 'Virtually', 'only', 'other', 'cinematic', 'work', 'might', 'say', 'Leni', 'Riefenstall', 'famous', 'documentary', ""'Triumph"", ""Will'.My"", 'point', 'based', 'fact', 'author', 'Rand', 'reasonable', 'position', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'form', 'simply', 'sense', 'when', 'applied', 'discipline', 'architecture', 'abberation', 'would', 'disappear', 'mind', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'were', 'sculptor', 'poet', 'painter', 'even', 'playwright', 'were', 'Michaelangelo', 'doing', 'Sistine', 'Chapel', 'ceiling', 'issue', 'get', 'really', 'fuzzy', 'creating', 'decoration', 'specific', 'patron', 'fill', 'very', 'specific', 'function.What', 'wrongheadedness', 'character', 'Roarke', 'individualism', 'so', 'apparant', 'played', 'out', 'world', 'architecture', 'where', 'almost', 'buildings', 'are', 'done', 'specific', 'client', 'commercial', 'buildings', 'almost', 'always', 'corporation', 'lots', 'different', 'opinions', 'needs', 'satisfy', 'simplest', 'case', 'family', 'husband', 'wife', '2.3', 'children', 'dog', 'looking', 'house', 'need', 'balance', 'financial', 'resources', 'number', 'bedrooms', 'number', 'closets', 'fenced', 'yard', 'Fido.If', 'think', 'hard', 'multiply', '1000', 'when', 'building', 'mall', 'highrise.The', 'thing', 'such', 'good', 'case', 'study', 'art', 'reason', 'right', 'wrong', 'fact', 'director', 'King', 'Vidor', 'principle', 'actors', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'script', 'blocking', 'cinematography', 'Massey', 'character', 'newspaper', 'magnate', 'one', 'immediately', 'inclined', 'make', 'comparisons', ""'Citizen"", ""Kane'.Unfortunately"", 'wrongheadedness', 'Rand', 'political', 'personal', 'philosophy', 'seriously', 'whole', 'film', 'Oddly', 'Cooper', 'character', 'remarkable', 'albeit', 'superficial', 'resemblence', 'Frank', 'Lloyd', 'Wright', 'career', 'am', 'sure', 'much', 'verisimillatude', 'story.But', 'what', 'little', 'know', 'Wright', 'career', 'was', 'largely', 'successful', 'outset', 'often', 'compromised', 'major', 'design', 'points.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'much', 'wrongheadedness', 'artistic', 'value']",The Fountainhead VHS

No matter what thinks of Rand as a philospher, very few people ever seriously try to make the case that her novels qualify as great literature.  The characters are one-dimensional, the themes are black & white, and the dialogue is more pontification than anything else.  This does not translate well at all to the big screen.  One is left with a storyline that positively rushes along as though trying to meet a deadline, and characters that make one absurd, extended speech after another.  An already rather hamfisted literary style becomes only more pronounced in the movie version.It always struck me as a little odd that architecture, of all things, was the medium used to make the Objectivist case concerning artistic integrity and individual expression.  The notion that the people commissioning buildings and houses (which they are paying for, not to mention working & living in) are expected to acquiesce to the whims of the architect is absurd.  What about their right to self-expression?  My wife & I built an addition to our house last year, and if the architect had refused to accept our input because he felt compelled to follow his muse, we would have given him the heave-ho.  Screw you; it's our house and we have muses too.  Rand never fully reconciled this paradox, and in her screenplay she made did not even make a half-hearted effort at it.  Roark's patrons are reduced to cartoons, who want certain architectural features because ""the public demands it.""  Ummmm....what?  I have yet to see mobs taking to the streets because they think buildings are ugly.To make matters worse, anyone seeing this movie who is not already familiar with Rand's philosophy & the novel will find this movie to be, at best, bizarre.  At worst, they will find it to be horrifyingly self-absorbed in its nature.

Slipman,"[4, 4]","The venerable Gary Cooper adeptly portrays Howard Roark, an unwavering principled architect in the Ayn Rand testament to individuality, ""The Fountainhead"".  Roark is a scion of modern architecture, steadfastly rejecting the accepted classical concepts in his field.  His stubborn approach initially leaves him penniless and without clients forcing him to work in a Connecticut stone quarry.While toiling in that rockpile, he meets Dominique Francon played by the comely Patricia Neal, a wealthy socialite and daughter of one of New York's foremost architects.  The frigidly emotionless Neal works as a columnist for a large tabloid, The Banner whose owner is wealthy newspaper magnate Gale Wynand played by Raymond Massey.  So begins the interplay between these three main characters.Cooper eventually gains fame and fortune designing and constructing a controversial housing project that is lampooned by The Banner with the approval of Massey.  Massey's henchman, architectural columnist Ellsworth Toohey played by Robert Douglas, jealous of Cooper's creative genius, proceeds to excoriate his every effort.Neal and Cooper fall in love but realize they can't be together and she eventually marries Massey. The wealthy Massey recognizing the genius of Roark bestows many choice projects on him and lives his life vicariously through Cooper's spirit.  In Massey's rise to the top he has lost his individuality, always catering to the masses.Cooper becomes enticed to design a massive housing project using a schooltime crony of his and Neal's father's partner the soft and venal Peter Keating played by Kent Smith as his front.  When the clients decide to alter his plans without first consulting him, denying him control of the project, the steadfast Cooper decides to take matters into his own hands.  His actions result in a court case, in which Massey is forced to take an unpopular stand.  Throughout Cooper rigidly stands up for the tenets in which he believes, refusing to abandon his creative rights and ideals.",5,A moralistic man stands up for his beliefs,1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,2018,"['venerable', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'adeptly', 'Howard', 'Roark', 'unwavering', 'principled', 'architect', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'testament', 'individuality', 'Fountainhead', 'Roark', 'scion', 'modern', 'architecture', 'steadfastly', 'rejecting', 'accepted', 'classical', 'concepts', 'field', 'stubborn', 'approach', 'initially', 'penniless', 'clients', 'forcing', 'work', 'Connecticut', 'stone', 'quarry.While', 'toiling', 'rockpile', 'Dominique', 'Francon', 'played', 'comely', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'wealthy', 'socialite', 'daughter', 'one', 'New', 'York', 'foremost', 'architects', 'frigidly', 'emotionless', 'Neal', 'columnist', 'large', 'tabloid', 'Banner', 'owner', 'wealthy', 'newspaper', 'magnate', 'Gale', 'Wynand', 'played', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'So', 'interplay', 'three', 'main', 'characters.Cooper', 'eventually', 'gains', 'fame', 'fortune', 'designing', 'constructing', 'controversial', 'housing', 'project', 'lampooned', 'Banner', 'approval', 'Massey', 'Massey', 'henchman', 'architectural', 'columnist', 'Ellsworth', 'Toohey', 'played', 'Robert', 'Douglas', 'jealous', 'Cooper', 'creative', 'genius', 'proceeds', 'excoriate', 'effort.Neal', 'Cooper', 'fall', 'love', 'realize', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'together', 'eventually', 'Massey', 'wealthy', 'Massey', 'recognizing', 'genius', 'Roark', 'many', 'choice', 'projects', 'life', 'vicariously', 'Cooper', 'spirit', 'Massey', 'rise', 'top', 'lost', 'individuality', 'always', 'catering', 'masses.Cooper', 'enticed', 'design', 'massive', 'housing', 'project', 'using', 'schooltime', 'crony', 'Neal', 'father', 'partner', 'soft', 'venal', 'Peter', 'Keating', 'played', 'Kent', 'Smith', 'front', 'When', 'clients', 'decide', 'alter', 'plans', 'first', 'consulting', 'denying', 'control', 'project', 'steadfast', 'Cooper', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'actions', 'result', 'court', 'case', 'Massey', 'forced', 'take', 'unpopular', 'stand', 'Cooper', 'rigidly', 'up', 'tenets', 'refusing', 'abandon', 'creative', 'rights', 'ideals']",The Fountainhead VHS

Whereas the twentieth-century's most severe defender of a singular concept of self-interest and personal expression probably saw in her work a manifesto for the salvation of the creative caste in humanity's mostly wasted population, I liked The Fountainhead for the strength of its visual effects. If this means I ""didn't get it"" then so be it.This is an impressive movie with sound performances filled with anger, arrogance, megalomania, and an intentional stoical woodenness that was extreme even for Gary Cooper. I liked the shots of buildings worked into existing cityscapes, and the trouble the makers of this motion picture went to to bring Rand's visions to the screen. What I didn't feel was a lot of affinity for Rand's message or for the occasional melodrama that was exhibited by nearly all. This production was often like Citizen Kane meets Brave New World. Some of my friends say Ayn Rand is the greatest writer and visionary the planet has ever produced. I am less generous in my evaluation of her, but I still don't hesitate to say this is a good movie, worth seeing, in no way a waste of time, just not the classic I was led to expect it would be.",4,Selfism 101,1183680000,"07 6, 2007",2007,1352,"['almost', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'come', 'away', 'viewing', 'Fountainhead', 'thinking', 'was', 'fine', 'film', 'reasons', 'other', 'screenwriter', 'author', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'might', 'have', 'wanted', 'be', 'twentieth-century', 'most', 'severe', 'defender', 'singular', 'concept', 'self-interest', 'personal', 'expression', 'probably', 'saw', 'work', 'manifesto', 'salvation', 'creative', 'caste', 'humanity', 'mostly', 'wasted', 'population', 'liked', 'Fountainhead', 'strength', 'visual', 'effects', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'then', 'so', 'be', 'it.This', 'impressive', 'movie', 'sound', 'performances', 'filled', 'anger', 'arrogance', 'megalomania', 'intentional', 'stoical', 'woodenness', 'was', 'extreme', 'even', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'liked', 'shots', 'buildings', 'worked', 'existing', 'cityscapes', 'trouble', 'makers', 'motion', 'picture', 'went', 'bring', 'Rand', 'visions', 'screen', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'lot', 'affinity', 'Rand', 'message', 'occasional', 'melodrama', 'was', 'exhibited', 'nearly', 'production', 'was', 'often', 'like', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'meets', 'Brave', 'New', 'World', 'friends', 'say', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'greatest', 'writer', 'visionary', 'planet', 'ever', 'produced', 'am', 'less', 'generous', 'evaluation', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'say', 'good', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'way', 'waste', 'time', 'just', 'not', 'classic', 'was', 'led', 'expect', 'would', 'be']",The Fountainhead VHS

I think one has to put the film in perspective of it's time.  I came out in the wake of what some perceived as the excesses of the New Deal and may have been a refreshing challenge to the accepted norms.  Watching the film I can't help to think that it anticapated the philosophy of Barry Goldwater.  Personally, I came of age under Ronald Reagan which I found to be a more satisfying compromise.  That is to say the rights of the individual are respected but informed by Judeo-Christian values.  Rand's uncompromising philosophy does not seem to be informed by a godliness.  That's where I differ with in that I think one can be true to oneself withouting eschewing altruism.  In a nutshell I respect this film without accepting all of the tenets it espouses.  This had to be a difficult film to make because of it's philosophical nature.  Director King Vidor pulls it off brilliantly working from a script by Rand and some stunning visual work.  The entire cast is terrific with a towering performance by Gary Cooper as Rand's everyman(Superman?).  Some would dismiss this film because of it's philosophy.

Some may think that Gary Cooper wasn't animated enough to carry forth the script written by Ayn Rand but it is her words that speak through anyone who plays the role of Howard Roark, the Architect and the independent thinking hero of creative thought in the film who is willing to sacrifice his career to insist on his ownership of his projects and his right to inspired independent creativity in the architectural design and building of his projects.Also woven into the script is the forbidden love affair between Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal which as biographers write, took place during this movie and after for many years. Their chemistry and their shared beliefs for the right to protect independent and original thought and ideas was well presented. The supporting cast was very believable; especially the unscrupulous newspaper columnist who boasted and then tried to ruin Howard Roark (Gary Cooper in the film) because Roark would not sell out his individuality. The newspaper owner played by Raymond Massey was also done well and entirely believable as well as Massey gives in to Roark's dedication to his architectural independence and winds up a broken man who takes his own life. The drama of the courtroom scene is where the words of Ayn Rand speak the strongest about the strength of individual thought and creative ideas and the right to the ownership of the aforementioned even if it means sacrificing everything and going to jail. Those words were undeniably Ayn Rand albeit spoken by Gary Cooper. Anyone who has read her books knows this.This is a timeless movie that you can enjoy again and again especially if you haven't seen it in a few years.

It should come as no surprise that the film is so faithful to Ayn Rand's eminently readable, marathon 1943 novel since Rand wrote the screenplay herself and in true individualistic fashion, demanded that not a word of it be changed during the filming. Consequently, every scene is full of dialogue with her cerebral polemics, sometimes heavy-handed but often sharply clever, much of it highlighting her philosophy of objectivism. She has the ideal partner-in-crime in director King Vidor, who brings his trademark melodramatic flourishes to a feverish pitch here. The result is often laughable for its excesses but irresistible for the Baroque style Vidor fluidly instills with every preposterous story turn.At the core of the time-spanning plot is Howard Roark, a supremely talented, uncompromising architect whose ego reigns supreme and whose selfishness ultimately marks him as a true success in his field. Interestingly, while Roark's designs bear a deliberate resemblance to Frank Lloyd Wright's prairie style, they more importantly retain a timeless, contemporary feel. His philosophical adversary is Ellsworth Toohey, an architectural critic for the New York Banner, a pompous elitist who values mediocrity as a means to subdue the masses. In between Roark and Toohey is the Banner's owner, tycoon Gail Wynand, whose successful climb out of his Hell's Kitchen background has given him unprecedented power to influence the masses. While he is Toohey's boss, Wynand gradually comes to admire Roark's talent and individualism.Complicating matters considerably is Dominique Francon, the headstrong daughter of a successful architect, whose primal attraction to Roark is mixed with self-loathing over what she envisions as his doomed visions. Roark's polar opposite can be found in his former classmate and rival architect Peter Keating, a man devoid of ideals and more than willing to accommodate the masses to ensure his livelihood. Their various interactions eventually lead to a melodramatic climax which has Roark secretly designing an expansive low-income housing project only to see it bastardized in construction. His fate hangs in the balance as he cannot reconcile the compromise made to his vision.While obviously too old in the early scenes, Gary Cooper is able to tap into Roark's darker side while dexterously maintaining his heroic standing. In quite a contrast to the amiable speech he gives in the climax of Frank Capra's ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"", he delivers the particularly lengthy, verbose courtroom speech with conviction. In only her second film, a 22-year old Patricia Neal is certainly a sizzling, glamorous presence as Dominique, and she makes the most of her rather impossible role even though Vidor seems to be encouraging her to go overboard frequently. Nowhere is this more evident than the hilariously over-the-top first encounters between Roark and Dominique when she thinks he is a lowly, testosterone-charged quarry worker (with one big gyrating drill!)As Wynand, Raymond Massey is able to lend surprising humanism to a man who finds in Roark his one opportunity to take a heroic stand. Robert Douglas overdoes Toohey's effete manner, but he does become the villain you love to hate. The weak link in the cast is Kent Smith as the simpering Keating, melting way too easily in the background. Adding immeasurably to the film's Baroque dimensions are the crescendo-filled music of the legendary Max Steiner, the deep shadows pervasive in Robert Burks' masterful cinematography, and the almost expressionistic sets by Edward Carrere and William L. Kuehl (note how ludicrously huge Wynand's office is). With no accompanying commentary track, the 2006 DVD contains just two extras - the original theatrical trailer and a strictly by-the-numbers short, just eighteen minutes, on the making of the film.",4,Wildly Excessive Melodrama Captures Ayn Rand's Diatribe Against Collectivism at a Feverish Pitch,1163030400,"11 9, 2006",2006,3976,"['getting', 'fact', '1949', 'movie', 'great', 'fun', 'pristine', 'print', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'film', 'so', 'faithful', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'eminently', 'readable', 'marathon', '1943', 'novel', 'Rand', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'true', 'individualistic', 'fashion', 'demanded', 'not', 'word', 'be', 'changed', 'filming', 'Consequently', 'scene', 'full', 'dialogue', 'cerebral', 'polemics', 'sometimes', 'heavy-handed', 'often', 'sharply', 'clever', 'much', 'highlighting', 'philosophy', 'objectivism', 'ideal', 'partner-in-crime', 'director', 'King', 'Vidor', 'who', 'trademark', 'melodramatic', 'flourishes', 'feverish', 'pitch', 'here', 'result', 'often', 'laughable', 'excesses', 'irresistible', 'Baroque', 'style', 'Vidor', 'fluidly', 'preposterous', 'story', 'core', 'time-spanning', 'plot', 'Howard', 'Roark', 'supremely', 'talented', 'uncompromising', 'architect', 'ego', 'supreme', 'selfishness', 'ultimately', 'true', 'success', 'field', 'Interestingly', 'Roark', 'designs', 'bear', 'deliberate', 'resemblance', 'Frank', 'Lloyd', 'Wright', 'prairie', 'style', 'more', 'importantly', 'retain', 'timeless', 'contemporary', 'feel', 'philosophical', 'adversary', 'Ellsworth', 'Toohey', 'architectural', 'critic', 'New', 'York', 'Banner', 'pompous', 'elitist', 'who', 'mediocrity', 'means', 'subdue', 'masses', 'Roark', 'Toohey', 'Banner', 'owner', 'tycoon', 'Gail', 'Wynand', 'successful', 'climb', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'background', 'given', 'unprecedented', 'power', 'influence', 'masses', 'Toohey', 'boss', 'Wynand', 'gradually', 'admire', 'Roark', 'talent', 'individualism.Complicating', 'matters', 'considerably', 'Dominique', 'Francon', 'headstrong', 'daughter', 'successful', 'architect', 'primal', 'attraction', 'Roark', 'mixed', 'self-loathing', 'what', 'doomed', 'visions', 'Roark', 'polar', 'opposite', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'former', 'classmate', 'rival', 'architect', 'Peter', 'Keating', 'man', 'devoid', 'ideals', 'more', 'willing', 'accommodate', 'masses', 'ensure', 'livelihood', 'various', 'interactions', 'eventually', 'lead', 'melodramatic', 'climax', 'Roark', 'secretly', 'designing', 'expansive', 'low-income', 'housing', 'project', 'only', 'see', 'bastardized', 'construction', 'fate', 'hangs', 'balance', 'can', 'not', 'reconcile', 'compromise', 'made', 'vision.While', 'obviously', 'too', 'old', 'early', 'scenes', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'able', 'tap', 'Roark', 'darker', 'side', 'dexterously', 'maintaining', 'heroic', 'standing', 'quite', 'contrast', 'amiable', 'speech', 'climax', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'Goes', 'Town', 'particularly', 'lengthy', 'verbose', 'courtroom', 'speech', 'conviction', 'only', 'second', 'film', '22-year', 'old', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'certainly', 'sizzling', 'glamorous', 'presence', 'Dominique', 'most', 'rather', 'impossible', 'role', 'even', 'Vidor', 'be', 'encouraging', 'go', 'overboard', 'frequently', 'Nowhere', 'more', 'evident', 'hilariously', 'over-the-top', 'first', 'encounters', 'Roark', 'Dominique', 'when', 'lowly', 'testosterone-charged', 'quarry', 'worker', 'one', 'big', 'gyrating', 'drill', 'Wynand', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'able', 'lend', 'surprising', 'humanism', 'man', 'who', 'Roark', 'one', 'opportunity', 'take', 'heroic', 'stand', 'Robert', 'Douglas', 'Toohey', 'effete', 'manner', 'become', 'villain', 'love', 'hate', 'weak', 'link', 'cast', 'Kent', 'Smith', 'simpering', 'Keating', 'melting', 'way', 'too', 'easily', 'background', 'Adding', 'immeasurably', 'film', 'Baroque', 'dimensions', 'are', 'crescendo-filled', 'music', 'legendary', 'Max', 'Steiner', 'deep', 'shadows', 'pervasive', 'Robert', 'Burks', 'masterful', 'cinematography', 'almost', 'expressionistic', 'sets', 'Edward', 'Carrere', 'William', 'L.', 'Kuehl', 'note', 'how', 'ludicrously', 'huge', 'Wynand', 'office', 'accompanying', 'commentary', 'track', '2006', 'DVD', 'just', 'two', 'extras', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'strictly', 'by-the-numbers', 'short', 'just', 'eighteen', 'minutes', 'making', 'film']",The Fountainhead VHS

The only interesting character of the book, Gail Waynad did not have any development, and we did not learn anything from his past, and about his way from Hell's Kitchen to the position of giving the public what it wants and creating single-hand the public opinion.Both Gary Cooper(very attractive but too old for playing Roark) and Patricia Neal are very good actors and you can feel how uncomfortable they are doing their best and trying to stay serious and sincere while saying the most ridiculous lines of dialogue ever committed to celluloid. When the dramatic and moving (supposedly) scenes make me giggle uncomfortably and feel sorry for the actors on the screen  I believe it was a bad movie. The scene in the court that was supposed to be Roark's triumph and celebration of Ayn Rand's philosophical ideas left me lost and confused about the way the criminal justice system worked in the Rand's utopian world.

One favourite moment is when Patricia Neal is caught at home during business hours by her employer, Raymond Massey managing editor of The Banner newspaper (cf New York Post),as she drops a white statuette artifact from her 20th floor NY apartment, watching it smash to pieces on the concrete below. When queried by her boss why, she explains she loves the statuette so much, it's so perfect, she has to destroy it because she does not want to be dependent on anything. The sexual imagery is also wonderfully Freudian and rich such as the long moment when Ms Neal as Dominique visits the quarry where Mr Cooper as the uncompromising architect Howard Roark is working as a labourer as he is unwilling to compromise his artistic integrity.  He stands there with the large drill extended in front of him whilst they exchange one of the longest most smoldering looks in cinematic history, her eyes dropping to the drill, the touch of a smirk/smile on his lips.  The finale is a classic Freudian moment, as we watch Ms Neal ascend the tallest phallic symbol in New York and experience the religious/sexual ecstasy of complete fulfilment.  A truly wonderful moment given aural power by the lush music of Max Steiner.

Selznick (producer of ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Rebecca"") didn't produce this as a faithful adaptation of the novel, but Henry Blanke (""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Casablanca"") DID, I recommend seeing the movie first. When you read the novel first, you cast it, design sets and play it out in your mind, and in my mind, Howard Roark is played by Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman is Dominique, and Orson Welles plays a thinly-veiled Charles Foster Kane, aka Gail Wynand. Screenplay by Charles Brackett and Ben Hecht, directed by Howard Hawks, Technicolor, music by Bernard Herrmann.Anyways, since that's all in my mind's eye, let us deal with what's really there:This film is the greatest example of post-German expressionism after World War II. Visually, it's overflowing with licht und schatten worthy of Lang and Murnau. This is the movie's greatest achievement, deftly accomplished by cinematographer Robert Burks, who confines Gary Cooper (the movie's martyred saint) in a shadow-world so oppressing, that it rivals Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" and Hitchcock's ""I Confess"" (for which Burks was also DP, as he was on all Hitch's films from the early 1950s through Marnie, in 1964, with the exception of ""Psycho"") for the sense of loneliness and psychological isolation which crowd in the hero.Burks owes a lot to ""Citizen Kane"" in the use of low-camera-angles employed in projecting the movie's tragic hero, Gail Wynand, played by Raymond Massey. Massey brings a British-Canadian flair to the role that is completely outrageous and incongruous with the role's Hell's Kitchen origins. So what! As with Cary Grant, Massey succeeds in the ""willing-suspension-of-disbelief"" department when it comes to ignoring his British accent.Burks' camera lingers longingly and tenderly on screen siren Patricia Neal, as Dominique. This is when REAL HOT WOMEN got Hollywood roles, and when the likes of Marilyn Monroe ""replaced"" Jane Russell and Kim Novak was groomed as the next Rita Hayworth. The scene in which Neal visits Coop's apartment with the none-too-subtle white fur bust ornament above her evening gown is priceless in the glamor department. A few reviewers call this movie ""dated."" If by dated, they mean not having untalented, unalluring and underfed matchsticks like Gwyneth Paltrow and Calista Flockheart, then, yes, ""The Fountainhead"" is dated.Britisher Robert Douglas plays Ellsworth Toohey, the rabble-rousing colmunist with over-the-top and villainous aplomb. Wielding his ever-present cigarette holder with blatant swishiness designed to circumvent the Hayes' office censors, Douglas gives the best flamboyant-homosexual-villian performance this side of Robert Walker, as the tortured Bruno in Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train.""Rounding out this bombastic Expressionist tour-de-force is Max Steiner's equally plush and bombastic Romantic score, which uses heavy brass and low strings to provide an aural sledgehammer that sets the action onscreen to the passionate sturm und drang of Tristan und Isolde.

280599,A9SIN6I9EHZF7,6301969294,James H. Rankin,"[6, 14]","Gary Cooper was well cast as the architect of ultimate principle and so noble a character might be hard to conceive, yet his portrayal of protagonist &quot;Howard Roark&quot; is sterling if not entirely moving. This is no fault of Mr. Cooper for he strives to portray a purity of motive that may be impossible. Worse is the premise of the film: that 'self-sacrifice' for public good is a craven defeat for the individualist who should have the integrity of his convictions, and that to himself alone.The denouement showing the fate of the titular antagonist, &quot;Gail Wynand&quot;, as essayed by Raymond Massey, is somewhat stilted and not entirely believable, but the prose is certainly vivid if not hyperbolically purple in this overblown morality play with the modes of architecture used to show the conflicts in the modes and mores of man. Patricia Neal's spoiled rich girl character swings from neurotically icy to suddenly torrid with nary a bedroom scene in sight yet serves no clear motivation for the drama, merely a convenient (and salacious) nexus for the meeting of events.Though architecture is used allegorically in the background, one learns little of it, but the story does bring to the fore a consideration of one's responsibility to posterity versus contemporary community. While we all can sympathize with the outrage of someone taking his labors of love and altering them without his consent, the point of the film (that ultimately one is only responsible to one's self) is lost to those who realize that human society could not long endure if each individual determined to stand apart regardless of the affect of his actions upon the whole, the body of man. When the architect takes matters into his own hands to the extent of breaking the law in a violent act that could endanger the public, the viewer's sympathy for him should vanish, for he demonstrates - and later proclaims in a monumental speech - that egoism is in his opinion, of greater importance than the public good. To be exculpated from such a demonstration vitiates what vaunted integrity the premise may have had and shows by the fate of newspaper publisher Wynand's recourse, the hollow hubris of self-made men.As a pretty morality play the movie is interesting and well acted, and visually splendid if not somewhat wordy and stagy, but as a proclamation of righteous, God-given morals, if falls entirely short.",4,A PONDEROUS NOVEL BECOMES GRIPPING FILM HOKUM,1003795200,"10 23, 2001",2001,2402,"['Gary', 'Cooper', 'was', 'well', 'cast', 'architect', 'ultimate', 'principle', 'so', 'noble', 'character', 'might', 'be', 'hard', 'conceive', 'yet', 'portrayal', 'protagonist', 'quot', 'Howard', 'Roark', 'quot', 'sterling', 'not', 'entirely', 'moving', 'fault', 'Mr.', 'Cooper', 'portray', 'purity', 'motive', 'may', 'be', 'impossible', 'Worse', 'premise', 'film', ""'self-sacrifice"", 'public', 'good', 'craven', 'defeat', 'individualist', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'integrity', 'convictions', 'alone.The', 'denouement', 'showing', 'fate', 'titular', 'antagonist', 'quot', 'Gail', 'Wynand', 'quot', 'essayed', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'somewhat', 'stilted', 'not', 'entirely', 'believable', 'prose', 'certainly', 'vivid', 'not', 'hyperbolically', 'purple', 'overblown', 'morality', 'play', 'modes', 'architecture', 'used', 'show', 'conflicts', 'modes', 'mores', 'man', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'girl', 'character', 'swings', 'neurotically', 'icy', 'suddenly', 'torrid', 'nary', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'sight', 'yet', 'clear', 'motivation', 'drama', 'merely', 'convenient', 'salacious', 'nexus', 'meeting', 'events.Though', 'architecture', 'used', 'allegorically', 'background', 'one', 'little', 'story', 'bring', 'fore', 'consideration', 'one', 'responsibility', 'posterity', 'versus', 'contemporary', 'community', 'can', 'sympathize', 'outrage', 'someone', 'taking', 'labors', 'love', 'altering', 'consent', 'point', 'film', 'ultimately', 'one', 'only', 'responsible', 'one', 'self', 'lost', 'who', 'realize', 'human', 'society', 'could', 'not', 'long', 'endure', 'individual', 'determined', 'stand', 'apart', 'regardless', 'affect', 'actions', 'whole', 'body', 'man', 'When', 'architect', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'extent', 'breaking', 'law', 'violent', 'act', 'could', 'endanger', 'public', 'viewer', 'sympathy', 'should', 'vanish', 'later', 'proclaims', 'monumental', 'speech', 'egoism', 'opinion', 'greater', 'importance', 'public', 'good', 'be', 'exculpated', 'such', 'demonstration', 'what', 'vaunted', 'integrity', 'premise', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'shows', 'fate', 'newspaper', 'publisher', 'Wynand', 'recourse', 'hollow', 'hubris', 'self-made', 'men.As', 'pretty', 'morality', 'play', 'movie', 'interesting', 'well', 'acted', 'visually', 'splendid', 'not', 'somewhat', 'wordy', 'stagy', 'proclamation', 'righteous', 'God-given', 'morals', 'falls', 'entirely', 'short']",The Fountainhead VHS

280603,ALTNI5BAFUAQY,6301969294,"Jery Tillotson ""cult author""","[20, 29]","Super star Gary Cooper was one year shy of the half-century mark when he lobbied, and to the horror of many, was awarded one of the most coveted male roles in movie history: Howard Roark. As described in Ayn Rand's still exhilirating masterpiece, The Fountainhead, Roark was a l9/20-year-old brilliant social rebel who battled society to live the way he wanted to and to build buildings the way he designed them. He was a dynamic, feisty, fearless rebel who moved and talked like the genius he was.The book starts off with Roark being kicked out of college because he refused to compromise his dreams of becoming not a good architect, but a great one.When Warner Brothers announced it had brought the movie rights to Ayn Rand's landmark novel, many in the film colony saw the Howard Roark part as a shoo-in for rebel-in-residence John Garfield. Charismatic, intense, gorgeous, a brillant artist, he had already created a niche in movies with his bad boy, smart, edgy roles,like the one in the Joan Crawford hit, ""Humoresque"" where he proved unforgettable as the troubled, snarling master violinist, Paul Boray.Cooper's image in private and on screen was that of a laconic, good-natured boy-next-door who might have parked his horse outside. Very rarely did he move or talk fast and his style was slow-moving and sleepy. In his role of Howard Roark he looks like the grandfather of the young rebel. Probably one of the most excruitiating scenes on film is Roark's big courtroom speech. Cooper resembles an old man, or an ageing cowpoke,whose wandered onto the wrong set, reading text off a teleprompter and at times his eyes bug out at some of the really high tone philosophy that author Ayn Rand wrote.Cooper was later to say that he understood nothing aboutt the script or his role.  Director King Vidor was later to write that he was appalled by the casting because equally badly cast was Patricia Neal in the juicy role of Roark's love interest--icy, brilliant, surreal Dominique Francon. Neal was a pretty, fresh-faced ingenue who photographed well.Again, many in the film colony thought Ida Lupino was the perfect actress for the role. She was considered the ""poor man's Bette Davis"" and had turned in extraordinary performances in ""They Drive By Night"" and ""The Hard Way."" Rand said she wrote the Dominique Francon character and later the Dagney Taggart personae in ""Atlas Shrugged"" with Greta Garbo in mind. But Garbo had already quit movies. Barbara Stanwyck was so obsessed with starring in The Fountainhead that she gave studio mogul, Jack Warner a copy of the book with a note saying she ""was born"" to play Dominique Francon.Cooper can't be entirely faulted for his fatal miscasting. Ayn Rand actually pushed for him to be cast. This was an era when the tiny circle of super stars truly believed their own immortality. Stars like Cooper were brainwashed to think ""their fans"" would love them in any role. Because the Howard Roark role was considered ""hot,"" every male star lobbied for it. Cooper probably was elated and thrilled to have snatched this prize from under the noses of his cohorts.

280607,AGH5RJDNL7TAZ,6301969294,"John Stodder ""a.k.a. Juan La Princi""","[26, 58]","This movie has a basic philosophical point that apparently got a lot of people excited in the 50s, Ayn Rand's simplistic statement that the individual has integrity, but the popular view of 'the mob' is always mediocre.  There isn't much more to it than that, but the author thought it was profound, and so did the makers of this film, which is based on Rand's novel.  I cannot imagine how this single, obvious point could be the basis of a 800 page novel.  As a movie, it's hypnotically bad. Every scene and every character make the same point.  The villains make idiotic speeches about how ""we have to consider public opinion, don't we?"" and the heroes say things like ""I got where I am by acting on my own honest judgement, no matter what anyone else thought.""  Although the cast is filled with great actors, in this film, the acting makes a daytime soap opera seem like the Royal Shakespeare Company.  The director apparently told everyone in the film to stand still and make a speech, preferably in a monotone.  The love affair between the architect Roark (who, in a fit of integrity, becomes a 'common laborer' after a bank board rejects his innovative design) and a fashionably-attired and presumably wealthy columnist who marries an egotistical newspaper publisher, is the most grim-faced romance ever filmed.  Yet his phallic architecture makes her weak kneed and vulnerable. The film pretends that architecture is an issue that a cynical publisher would put on the front page to stir the masses and boost circulation.  Right. Thousands of people will write the paper demanding that all buildings have Greek ornamentation. Uh huh.Rent or buy this movie if you want to feel like you're on heavy drugs.

That being said, this is an unforgettable film that may even change your life. Raymond Massey gives a great performance in his usual ""King Cutler"" manner as Gail Wynand the publisher who rose from Hell's Kitchen to become a ""man of the people"". The characters are unrealistic but interesting. Especially Toohey as the villain. The musical score DOMINATES the film. In fact, you will remember the score better than the story. Gary Cooper gives a stiff performance but in consideration that the character is considered odd, his work fits the film. Now everyone knows that it is based on the Philosophy of Ayn Rand and the cult of individualism over collective control. In reflecting those values we get some real and unreal scenes. I can't for the life of me see why there would be protests and riots because ""The Banner"" defends Roark or over the building of ""The Enright House"". What is realistic are insidious and evil individuals trying to sway the public through their own propaganda to agree with them in prosecuting others (in this case Roark, the symbol of ultimate individualism). Rand was a big fan of the legal system as a vindication of truth and uses the vehicle as she did in  ""Penthouse Legend"" again to give this picture a dramatic climax. What was not worthwhile was how she handled the Wynand character, committing suicide because he did not stand up for his principles all the way. You end up feeling sorry for Wynand and the seeming inability to restore the friendship that he has with Roark. When this picture is shown on television, it is CUT to shreds. So much so that one night the first scene was when Dominique Francon is shown throwing the statue of the god out the window!(almost 20 minutes into the picture!) Now of couse we desire an uncut DVD.

280618,A2ICI500LRO01K,6301969294,Kyle Wells,"[9, 18]","I had never heard of Ayn Rand before last summer. Somehow she had slipped through. Upon recommendation I read ""The Fountainhead"" while traveling. Now home, I watched the 1949 film adaptation last night. I have admittedly never read anything else by Rand. But with ""The Fountainhead"", both as a novel and as a film, I have a very conflicted relationship. I will refer to both the novel and the movie as basically being one in the same. The film for me, and I suppose this is a criticism, was basically a recap of the book. The novel is written in such a way that from the start it reminded me of a Hollywood studio picture, and as the film proves the jump from the page to the screen was not a long one. Sure the film cuts out a good half of the material in the novel, but that which remains stays true to Rand's general style and her ideas are put across with no loss in complexity or meaning. That too was a criticism. And with the film, just as with the novel, I had the same conflicting urge to both marvel at its bravado and, at the same time, to throw the whole thing out the window.Ayn Rand is a terrible writer. And the filmmakers behind this movie were no masters themselves. I found it amusing that ""The Fountainhead"", a story about restless individualism and groundbreaking originality, should be made by a group of such un-notable studio yes-men. I also found it appropriate. Ayn Rand, as a writer of fiction, did not seem to have an original bone in her body, and neither do these filmmakers. It is a 1940s studio film of only the most standard quality. Sure it may have been a bit more ruggedly sexual and pseudo intellectual then its contemporaries, but in regards to both content and especially form the movie is distinctively average. The camera does nothing of note, and neither do the actors really, then again Rand's characters are so astoundingly static and one-dimensional, in both novel and film, that it would have been a near Howard Roarkian feat to bring any life to them. The only actor I thought particularly well suited for his role was Gary Cooper who was finally given a character as bland as his own style of acting. I'm sure there are lots of diehard Cooper fans out there. I am not one of them. But if we are to praise a film for accurate adaptation then there are certainly triumphs to be had. The film is as pedantic and clich&eacute;d as the novel. The characters are as insultingly unrealistic as they are in the novel (Roark, D. Francon) and given just as little chance for redemption if flawed (Keating, Wynand). And Ayn Rand's philosophy of objectivism is both as intriguing and at the same time annoyingly frustrating as it is in the novel.So now that I've had a bit of a rant about how, in terms of form, just how bad ""The Fountainhead"" is, let me now address my conflicted relationship with its content. As bad as ""The Fountainhead"" is both as a film and a novel, I would say that few things I have either read or seen in recent history have had a greater impact on me or have stuck with me as persistently as this work. This is a compliment. Ayn Rand may have been on to something. Her views on originality and self-determinism do hold merit with me and I have often found myself thinking of Howard Roark when trying to find direction in my own life or when attempting to figure out what to do next. I like her description of selfishness, I think her views on genius and individuality are often healthy and inspiring. Unfortunately I also think that they are often the cause of most of the world's troubles, namely wars and industrialism. George W. Bush possesses perhaps a little too much of the Roarkian spirit. Her views are also often unfortunately simplistic and occasionally near infantile. Most people are not geniuses. Most people are unsure of what they want out of life. Most people, geniuses included I feel, have doubts, fears, pressures, insecurities, and, yes, even an unfortunate consideration of what other people think of them. This is healthy. It is part of being human. It is also an essential ingredient of great art. Ayn Rand believes that we should have an ideal to strive for, and that with Roark she has provided one, but she has made it so dogmatic, so beyond the grasp of any real person, that I fear little more then disappointment and loneliness would lie in wait for anyone who dared to reach for it. Her biggest failure to me as a writer is her apparent blindness to the ways society and humans as individuals actually behave and operate and her insistence on presenting her readers and viewers with her own completely unrealistic and climate controlled universe, the only universe where an actual rendering of her ideals would be possible. Maybe I am just one of the `second handers' or `parasites' she so flippantly condemns and therefore cannot see the heights to which man can aspire, but, if so, I feel that I am not alone, that in fact there may be no alternative.The ultimate frustration for me, and the proof of the unrealistic heights of her ideals, is again the poor quality of the work. She insisted, in a Roarkian manner, that no changes be made to her script for the film. She obviously felt that, like Roark's buildings, her ideas were her own, most likely brilliant and groundbreaking, and that no opinion or touch of the public should be thrust upon them. Good for her. That's all well and good, and maybe her example should be followed, but I find it ironic and disheartening that a writer so in praise of originality, so quick to triumph that which paves new ground for humanity, should present her ideas in such a pedantic and uninspired manner. Either Ayn Rand was a failure from the start or we now live in a world, some seventy years later, so oversaturated with every possible form and manner of `artistic expression' that originality is no longer possible. I have trouble believing this and instead feel that Ayn Rand is a hack, not because she is so original and so beyond my grasp that I, like Roark's public, cannot come to terms with her brilliance but because she, as a writer, cannot come to terms with everything that surrounds her little self-made, ideal bubble. The world and the people that inhabit it are not that bad. Concepts of community and society, as groups of people, are not inherently negative. Perhaps Ayn Rand could not see that. ""The Fountainhead"" is a second-rate adaptation of a second-rate novel by a second-rate writer/intellectual who had the basic notions of some possibly first-rate ideals, ideals she herself proved to be unobtainable. I have, so far, a very conflicted and ever evolving relationship with Ayn Rand.",3,Oh Ayn Rand...,1201132800,"01 24, 2008",2008,6644,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'last', 'summer',

The Fountainhead combines noir-romance with psychological-drama.  Few thing every viewer should know about this film on the sidelines:1) The movie is based on the controversial novel The Fountainhead written by Ayn Rand in 1943.2) The movie most likely served the purpose of promoting individualism (capitalism) v. collectivism (socialism) in the cold war times (propaganda).3) Patricia Neal and Gary Cooper make a very convincing couple on the screen, whenever these two meet, sparks fly.

280633,A2Y47HN5IP85J,6301969294,M. Richardson,"[13, 18]","While I am an enormous fan of Ayn Rand's original novel, this movie is awful. It should have been good. The director (King Vidor) was one of the great directors of early-twentieth century cinema. The cast included such talents as Gary Cooper, Patricia Neal, (a young) Patricia Neal, Raymond Massey (who gave, by far, the film's best performance), and others. The original author was intimately involved in the process of the film's creation. The source material was fantastic. So what went wrong? Three things, in my opinion:1) The Acting and the Script: While there are good actors in this film, and I love Rand's stylistic dialogue, the two simply didn't mesh here. Cooper was quite simply a very bad choice for the lead character, and his delivery of Roark's dialogue is all-wrong (note the lack of conviction in his voice during the famed trial speech near the end of the film). Neal is a very good choice for Dominique Francon, but her character isn't given sufficient time to be established, and rather than conveying the passionate pessimism of the novel's character, she comes off merely as crazed and impulsive. Robert Douglas is completely miscast as Ellsworth Toohey. Kent Smith might have made for a good Keating, but his character is also never given room to breathe. Raymond Massey was great as Wynand, however, and he is one of the few bright points in this production.2) Relative Brevity: The Fountainhead was an enormous book, and I mean this in more than just girth. As one of the great ""novels of ideas"" of the last century, the book deserved a production large enough to do justice to its complex ideas and dramatic intensity. This, however, is impossible, due to the short length of the film. Significant portions of necessary plot are cut out, giving this film a jerky and undramatic feel. The worst of the cuts is what amounts to the first 100 pages of the novel. A short and entirely unsatisfactory montage covers the long period of time between the beginning of the novel, where Howard Roark is expelled from a university, to the death of a major character. All of this information is given to the bewildered viewer in about two minutes, after which the film carries on adapting scenes from the book which, divorced from their dramatic context, become either disappointing or confusing, depending on whether you have read the novel or not.3) The Involvement of Ayn Rand in the Production: I know I listed this as a potential plus earlier in the review, and it probably would have been, had the author been anyone other than Ayn Rand. This woman, while brilliant and creative, was also something of a control-freak, and, evidently, stubborn to a fault. She pretty much forced the inclusion of material in the film that was inappropriate for the format of the production (a film is not a novel, and what works well in one won't necessarily work well in another). It is telling that the best film adaptation of any of her books (We the Living) was produced in Italy without her knowledge or consent.Overall, this is a completely disappointing movie that had the potential for greatness.

There was a rather bold bit of sexual symbolism about a fourth of the way into the movie.  There was a scene at a marble quarry with our hero, Howard Roark (Gary Cooper), drilling away into the rock.  This image enraptures Patricia Neal who was watching from above.  She's back the next day with her riding crop (but no horse).  They banter back and forth visually like this culminating in a rather violent climax.  This series of scenes may seem corny to many but it is an example of what movies used to do very effectively; show suggestive material without hitting us over the head with us.  This is just the sort of artistic use of visual symbolism that modern American film directors seem totally unable to utilize.  Modern American film tends to put it all up on the screen for everyone to see.  Very little is left to the imagination with the result that most movies are unfit for juveniles to see.  I'm not sure I know many juveniles that would want to sit through ""The Fountainhead"" but there's nothing in the movie that would give it anything other than a ""G"" rating.  This despite the bold sexual imagery that it displays.There is a lot of strong acting in the movie which is fitting because the movie is about strong individuals.  The storyline is that society represses the strength and artistic abilities of the individual.  The old adage; ""to get along you have to go along"" works to maintain the status quo.  The person with truly new ideas is chased out of town because society abhors change.  This is the premise at least.  I don't happen to agree with it.  Most of us recognize the moment we get married (if we didn't already know it by then) that compromising for the better good of all is the way that works the best.  Some may say that society has compromised way too much but the world view that ""The Fountainhead"" portrays gets to be a wee bit too totalitarian.  Nonetheless, the movie does an excellent job of portraying an eclectic group of individualists and makes a statement by showing the breaking point of each.

The characters are 2-dimensional archetypes rather than actual people.  The Rand books tend to be more popular among the young.  Once you grow up and live in the real world you realize that much of her vision was fantasyland.  She saw the world as black and white.

What makes FOUNTAINHEAD great are the overly dramatic film noirish scenes where ice princess and newspaper gal about town, Dominique Francon (played by Patricia Neal) rattles off long monologues that leave the viewer and innovative architect Howard Rourke (played by Gary Cooper) charmed.Plus the film is just gorgeous.  The scenes and locations are indescribably beautiful, particularly the party celebrating the opening of the Enwright House.  That is one breath-takingly stunning apartment and yet all the stylish people floating through it have looks of horror on their faces.  ""It just isn't homey,"" one snobby lady notes as she searches for the neoclassical embellishments she's more familiar with.Perhaps my favorite character is Gale Wynand, Dominique's husband and the owner of the Banner, the city's scandal-obsessed tabloid newspaper.  A self made man, Gale hires Rourke to build a country home as a testament to his love for icy, idealist wife.  No matter how many times I see this film I will never grow tired of the monologue Wynand offers to explain the ""unspeakable struggle"" that brought him from destitute poverty growing up in New York's Hell's Kitchen to fabulous wealth.Two other characters are worth noting here.  One is Ellsworth Toohey, the power-obsessed architecture columnist, who uses his pulpit to control and manipulate public opinions and the minds of weak architects like Peter Keating.  An architecture school contemporary of Howard Rourke, Keating is Rourke's polar opposite philosophically.  A follower, who will literally build anything someone will pay for, Keating lacks the soul and vision that makes Rourke such a compelling masculine ideal.I could go on and on writing about this fantastic film but I will restrain myself.  Still I will say if you like the 1940s, film noir, gorgeous design, lady-like clothing and the good old days when men were men and women were stylish, prim and complicated, rent the FOUNTAINHEAD.

In some circles, it's a near-classic film.  What we have is the story of Howard Roark, a man of principle who cannot get work as an architect because he will not compromise his skills by conforming to meet only what has been done before.  He will not allow his work to become a committee project.Patricia Neal is Dominique Francon, a spoiled woman who is determined she will never love anyone because no one will ever be worthy of her love, a love that only a man of principle could aspire to.  Since, in her experience, there are no such men, she is determined to be cold-hearted and removed.One day, though, she sees Howard Roark in a granite quarry.  Her attraction to him, it seems, is purely animal magnetism.  She storms and stews.  She frantically paces in her bedroom.  She seethes with unbridled angst and determination. In an act of lustful desperation, she smashes a beautiful marble hearth in order to get Roark into her bedroom in order to make a connection with him.He measures the hearth and orders the marble.  When the marble arrives, he sends a mason to install it.  Dominique takes this as an act of indifference on Roark's part, and it infuriates her. She chases him down and whacks him across the face with a riding crop.The rest must be seen to be believed.Raymond Massey is very good as the editor of The Banner, the newspaper that tries to destroy everything that is good and noble, etc.,etc.,etc.It has one of the most glorious Max Steiner scores EVER.This is one of those movies that goes on and on, and, yet, there is NEVER A DULL MOMENT.I don't recall the novel of ""The Fountainhead"" being this brassy and -- for lack of a more-appropriate word -- trashy.Thus, I can highly recommend ""The Fountainhead"" as both a novel and as a movie, both of which exist independent of the other...with the movie getting the 'you'd never imagine this in a million years' award for its adaptation, especially given that it's Ayn Rand, herself, who scripted the film.This is one hell of a movie that everyone ought to see!",4,One hell of a movie!,1184803200,"07 19, 2007",2007,2120,"['What', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'over-the-top', 'potboilers', 'era', 'circles', 'near-classic', 'film', 'What', 'have', 'story', 'Howard', 'Roark', 'man', 'principle', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'work', 'architect', 'will', 'not', 'compromise', 'skills', 'conforming', 'meet', 'only', 'what', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'work', 'become', 'committee', 'project.Patricia', 'Neal', 'Dominique', 'Francon', 'spoiled', 'woman', 'who', 'determined', 'will', 'never', 'love', 'anyone', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'worthy', 'love', 'love', 'only', 'man', 'principle', 'could', 'aspire', 'experience', 'are', 'such', 'men', 'determined', 'be', 'cold-hearted', 'removed.One', 'day', 'though', 'Howard', 'Roark', 'granite', 'quarry', 'attraction', 'purely', 'animal', 'magnetism', 'stews', 'frantically', 'paces', 'bedroom', 'unbridled', 'angst', 'determination', 'act', 'lustful', 'desperation', 'beautiful', 'marble', 'hearth', 'order', 'get', 'Roark', 'bedroom', 'order', 'make', 'connection', 'him.He', 'hearth', 'orders', 'marble', 'When', 'marble', 'arrives', 'mason', 'install', 'Dominique', 'act', 'indifference', 'Roark', 'part', 'down', 'face', 'riding', 'crop.The', 'rest', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed.Raymond', 'Massey', 'very', 'good', 'editor', 'Banner', 'newspaper', 'destroy', 'everything', 'good', 'noble', 'etc.', 'etc.', 'etc.It', 'one', 'most', 'glorious', 'Max', 'Steiner', 'EVER.This', 'one', 'movies', 'yet', 'NEVER', 'A', 'DULL', 'MOMENT.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'novel', 'Fountainhead', 'being', 'brassy', 'lack', 'more-appropriate', 'word', 'trashy.Thus', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Fountainhead', 'novel', 'movie', 'exist', 'independent', 'other', 'movie', 'getting', ""'you"", ""'d"", 'never', 'imagine', 'million', 'years', 'award', 'adaptation', 'especially', 'given', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'who', 'scripted', 'film.This', 'one', 'hell', 'movie', 'everyone', 'ought', 'see']",The Fountainhead VHS

280657,A17639YIJLDS1G,6301969294,still searching,"[5, 6]","This has to be, by any measure, one of the most bizarre films ever made based, of course, upon one of the dottiest books!  With the character of Howard Roark, Rand personified her own unique `objectivist' philosophy and Vidor put it on the screen in the form of Gary Cooper who enunciates his lines even more robotically than usual rather as if he can't quite believe what he is being required to say!  The script, penned by Rand herself, requires that almost every character deliver their lines as if each were their last and most heroic utterance!  The symbolism, too, is hardly subtle.  For example, in one scene the heroine, Dominique Francon, played by Patricia Neal, beautiful but hard, frigid and sanctimonious, first encounters Roark while he chooses to work as a day labourer in her father's quarry rather than prostitute his architectural `genius' in the pursuit of wealth and wordly acclaim.  She stands looking down on this `tall, gaunt' man piercing the hard, rigid rock faade with a large drill that he holds tightly as if it were an extension of his arm.  Naturally, the rock crumbles under the force of this penetration! We then see her later, obsessed by this image, breaking the marble fireplace in her bedroom as a pretext to get Roark to come to her.  Needless, to say the course of this true love just wasn't meant to run smoothly and Roark deserts Dominique in order to return to New York in response to a request from a wealthy, and obviously discerning, patron to design and build an apartment block.  It is here, on the opening night of the controversial building, that the two are temporarily reunited.The other central character Gail Wynand, who employs Dominique as a columnist on his paper `The Banner' - a kind of 1940's The Sun - shares many of Roark's characteristics although, ironically, his immense wealth is based upon pandering to the needs of the masses rather than standing alone as Roark chooses to do.

Fortunately, the theme of the story, a man's uncompromising individuality, more than makes up for the film's shortcomings.  Throughout her life, Ayn, (pronounced eye-ann), Rand, influenced by her childhood experiences in communist Russia, campaigned for the rights of the individual over the collective.  Her novel ""The Fountainhead"" was her crowning achievement in this direction.  Although her ideas did not translate into film as well as they might have, her message comes through loud and clear.

Yes it is a LOVE Story but it is more than that as well.  This movie shows it is not easy living with the ugly politics that make it painful to be a visionary genius advocating designs and concepts far ahead of their time.  Money focuses most intently on what worked in the past so anyone daring to look too far into the future is seen as a distablizing influence.  In the Monied world the idict is conform or die and be quick about it, and The Fountainhead is a movie about that lone awesome magical individual who goes against the conventional wisdoms of his time to champion new ideas that currently have no high powered corporate backers.I like The Fountainhead because, it shows that firm unwavering commitment to one's core ideals matters amd matters most when few of the current in crowd have the guts to stand with you.  The Fountainhead shows how far too many people let themselves be led like mindless sheep by a media, ""that thinks it alone knows whats best for society.  The Fountainhead shows how too many people are content to live blind, bland uninspired lives steeped in a purposefully ignorance that in time saps their creative souls.  The Fountainhead is as much about art as it is a movie about architecture, The Fountainhead is more than a movie about love between a man and a woman, the The Fountainhead speaks to the human heart of man and why he creates.  True creativity like the human can not be constrained, corporate blinders are inconsistant with what any visionary person see's be they inventor, accountant or architect.I love this movie because, it embraces and celebrates the human hearts need for creativity to live at its fullest potential.  Is the movie perfect NOPE, but for what it is The Fountainhead is awesome.  I have been wishing and hoping the Fountainhead would come out on DVD.  I have the VHS version and I wear it out watching it.  Of course I will be buying the DVD of The Fountainhead and hope you treat yourself to a copy as well.  Watch The Fountainhead then go out and create something awesome that changes the world for the better!  Hey a old wolf dude can dream can't he!

They're talking about er...marble.This is in a scene which occurs shortly after their first encounter, when Dominique spots Roark and his muscular forearm working at a quarry operating a drilling machine into the stone.After a long and prolongued silence which ranks among the best moments in cinema, she asks, from her height above the pit: ""Why are you looking at me?"" Roark replies: ""For the same reason you're looking at me.""And if you think that's a good moment, wait till Roark's  climactic speech to the jury.  Over five minutes long. (What!  A movie audience sitting still through a speech? Impossible!) and absolutely spellbinding.The film version of Ayn Rand's bestselling novel was directed by the expressionist master, King Vidor, and the screenplay written by, of all people, Ayn Rand.Who, during a pre-production party  accosted Jack L. Warner and  warned him that if he cheapened or otherwise dumbed down her work, she would  dynamite his studio. She nmeant it. Jack smiled and gave her a cigar.The Fountainhead is the story of a hero who wins.By hero, we mean an uncompromising man of genius and absolute integrity. This seems as far fetched to us as Cyrano fighting a hundred armed swordsmen---and winning! (Rostand was a major influence for Rand ) It's clearly impossible.  He's not in Russia, so he won't be shot, it's not that explicit--it's America, he's bound to quietly fade into obscurity and failure. It would be naive to suppose otherwise, so how  can this be a triumph instead of a tragedy?Thematically that's the question that Roark's alter egos Gail Wynand (Raymond Massey) and Dominique  Francon ask themselves. Gail is the billionare owner of an ""Enquirer"" type of news rag who rose from poverty by giving the suckers what they wanted. He lives by the credo ""Oppress or be oppressed.""Dominique wants to want nothing, the logical credo of a beautifull woman who is convinced that beauty and greatness have no chance at all in this world. We first meet her as she's destroying of a statue of a Greek god.  She's fallen in love with it and can't bear the pain of neeeding it, or anything else.As usual with Rand, these are tortured giants, not the ""folks next door""Critics of Rand are right in stating that they are improbable beings. (Name a great man or woman of history who isn't).Roark does make Conan the Barbarian look like a wimp by comparison. But you see, that's the fun of it. As are her villains, who are NOT romanticized ( forget ""Bonnie and Clyde"" , ""The Godfather"" and the rest of zillions of  ever so cool bad guys we've been fed by Hollywood for decades) they are chilling parasites, exemplified in the character of Ellsworh Toohey.I'ts Ayn Rand, people.

This film, which is, quite simply, the most unintentionally funny movie I have ever seen,is valuable only because it shows clearly why so many people who ranted (her name really should have been Ayn Rant)about the (very real) horrors of Communism in the years after World War One eventually wound up snugly in the grasp of Herr Schicklgruber and his little elves. (And, yes, I know that Rand wasn't herself a Nazi; she just played one in print -- and here, on screen.) Cooper's architect is an embodiment of the way Hitler saw himself: a Promethean creator, rejected by the Establishment that didn't know a genius when it saw one.It's hard to know which of the film's many inanities is the choicest. The idea that a &quot;yellow&quot;(i.e.,tabloid)newspaper could get the masses of New York worked up into a riotous frenzy over -- ARCHITECTURAL STYLES????? The proposition that, even after years of getting high-profile commissions, Cooper is STILL helplessly at the mercy of unfeeling mediocrities, who can kill off his entire career with one press release? The notion that one can be put on trial for the crime of not following mass taste?(In AMERICA????? -- where the biggest problem has always been ESTABLISHING a tradition, not breaking free of one.)And, of course, like any good fascist, Miss Rand never concerns herself with corny old concepts like right and wrong. (&quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;, doncha know.)Cooper actually DID commit the act of vandalism for which he is tried; yet his acquittal is treated like a triumph of justice(presumably because no one Miss Rand cared about happened to get caught in that explosion he set off).And the homosexual subtext of this film -in the relationship between Cooper and his former enemy the publisher-is nothing short of hilarious.(When the boys plan their around-the-world cruise together, you don't need to wait for the dialogue to tell you that Patricia Neal won't be coming along).Finally, what makes this whole enterprise even wackier is that Rand doesn't even have the consistency of her own idiocy. The idea that a man like Cooper - proud, rugged, the ultimate loner- would allow a no-talent rival, WITH HIS BLESSING, to take one of his most prized concepts and pass it off as his own makes utter nonsense of everything we have been shown up to that point.In sum, if you want to do justice to &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, invite over any Patrick Buchanan and David Duke supporters you may happen to know, put some bratwurst on the grill, pop this gem into the VCR, and have a ball.",1,&quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Fascist&quot;,972604800,"10 27, 2000",2000,2717,"['late', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'was', 'supreme', 'proof', 'George', 'Orwell', 'comment', 'only', 'intellectuals', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'certain', 'ideas', 'ordinary', 'person', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'stupid', 'film', 'quite', 'simply', 'most', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'valuable', 'only', 'clearly', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'ranted', 'name', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Ayn', 'Rant', 'very', 'real', 'horrors', 'Communism', 'years', 'World', 'War', 'One', 'eventually', 'wound', 'up', 'snugly', 'grasp', 'Herr', 'Schicklgruber', 'little', 'elves', 'yes', 'know', 'Rand', 'was', ""n't"", 'Nazi', 'just', 'played', 'one', 'print', 'here', 'screen', 'Cooper', 'architect', 'embodiment', 'way', 'Hitler', 'saw', 'Promethean', 'creator', 'rejected', 'Establishment', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'genius', 'when', 'saw', 'hard', 'know', 'film', 'many', 'inanities', 'choicest', 'idea', 'quot', 'quot', 'i.e.', 'tabloid', 'newspaper', 'could', 'get', 'masses', 'New', 'York', 'worked', 'up', 'riotous', 'frenzy', 'ARCHITECTURAL', 'STYLES', 'proposition', 'even', 'years', 'getting', 'high-profile', 'commissions', 'Cooper', 'STILL', 'helplessly', 'mercy', 'unfeeling', 'mediocrities', 'who', 'can', 'kill', 'off', 'entire', 'career', 'one', 'press', 'release', 'notion', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'put', 'trial', 'crime', 'not', 'following', 'mass', 'taste', 'AMERICA', 'where', 'biggest', 'problem', 'always', 'been', 'ESTABLISHING', 'tradition', 'not', 'breaking', 'free', 'one', 'course', 'good', 'fascist', 'Miss', 'Rand', 'never', 'corny', 'old', 'concepts', 'right', 'wrong', 'quot', 'Beyond', 'Good', 'Evil', 'quot', 'doncha', 'know', 'Cooper', 'actually', 'DID', 'commit', 'act', 'vandalism', 'tried', 'acquittal', 'treated', 'triumph', 'justice', 'presumably', 'one', 'Miss', 'Rand', 'cared', 'about', 'happened', 'get', 'caught', 'explosion', 'set', 'off', 'homosexual', 'subtext', 'film', 'relationship', 'Cooper', 'former', 'enemy', 'publisher-is', 'nothing', 'short', 'hilarious', 'When', 'boys', 'plan', 'around-the-world', 'cruise', 'together', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'wait', 'dialogue', 'tell', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'coming', 'along', '.Finally', 'what', 'whole', 'enterprise', 'even', 'wackier', 'Rand', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'consistency', 'own', 'idiocy', 'idea', 'man', 'Cooper', 'proud', 'rugged', 'ultimate', 'loner-', 'would', 'allow', 'no-talent', 'rival', 'WITH', 'HIS', 'BLESSING', 'take', 'one', 'most', 'prized', 'concepts', 'pass', 'off', 'own', 'utter', 'nonsense', 'everything', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'up', 'point.In', 'sum', 'want', 'do', 'justice', 'quot', 'Fountainhead', 'quot', 'invite', 'Patrick', 'Buchanan', 'David', 'Duke', 'supporters', 'may', 'happen', 'know', 'put', 'bratwurst', 'grill', 'pop', 'gem', 'VCR', 'have', 'ball']",The Fountainhead VHS

Isley, Jr.","[1, 1]","There is much to be concerned about in this typical election year of heated and superficial political vituperation that goes under the wholly misleading name of debate.  As a teacher at a Christian school, I am more troubled by the peculiar attraction that the militantly atheist writer Ayn Rand (1905-1982) holds for a number self-styled, rightwing libertarian Christians.Ayn Rand&#8217;s objectivist philosophy holds to several explicitly anti-Christian tenets.  According to Rand, all knowledge is based upon sense perception, and reason interprets the data provided by sense perception.  Consequently, she rejects the Christian belief in revelation and in God, who in some fashion is beyond the reach of sovereign reason and sense perception.  In ethics she supports rational egoism, which argues that the happiness of the individual is found in pursuing his own interests and thus refusing to sacrifice himself for others.  Such an ethics is hardly conducive to a Christian lifestyle based upon the God who gave of himself on the cross for others.  Finally, according to Rand, society prospers when the elite of creative and strong individuals is allowed to pursue its artistic and scientific visions.  Once again, this runs contrary to the Lord who taught that the meek will inherit the earth.For those who, like me, do not want to wade through Rand&#8217;s philosophical essays and long novels (The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged), I would recommend viewing the 1949 movie The Fountainhead.  Since she wrote the script and zealously guarded its integrity, the film is an accurate portrayal of her philosophy.  While the film is overly melodramatic, it is enjoyable, has an outstanding cast and some stunning visual effects.The story is about Howard Roark, played by Gary Cooper, an architect who will not compromise his unique artistic vision to the mediocrity and vulgarity of the crowd.  His strength and integrity convert the cynical newspaper publisher Gail Wynand and wins the heart of the bored and disillusioned socialite and columnist Dominique Francon, played respectively and effectively by Raymond Massey and Patricia Neal.  All three despise the mob mentality of the common man.  Roark emerges triumphant at the end of the film.From the perspective of a Christian, Rand&#8217;s film is a paean to the great man.  Its superman elitism is clearly in tension with the biblical view that all men are created in the image of God.  It is destructive because only the very few can live up to its creed.  All others fail in the attempt, as is shown by the suicide of Wynand, who could not resist the pressure of society to conform.  Its idolatry is explicit in the closing scene in which Dominique, ascending to the heights in an elevator, worshipfully gazes at Roark standing godlike against the wind at the top of his new skyscraper.Two anecdotes surrounding the movie are quite telling.  The first illustrates the human failure of Rand&#8217;s philosophy in contrast to the Christianity that she rejected.  I could mention the poisonous relationships between Rand and her objectivist followers, but instead will tell the stories of Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal.  They began an affair while making the film.  In order to demonstrate their support for Rand&#8217;s philosophical egoism, they made the affair public but, after breaking up, discovered in the end that Rand&#8217;s philosophy was not the source of true happiness.  Late in his life Gary Cooper converted to Roman Catholicism.  Patricia Neal, who was later reconciled to Cooper&#8217;s wife and daughter, also converted to Roman Catholicism four months before she died.Finally, the special features commentary on the DVD states that Hollywood was hesitant to produce the film because of its anti-Christian message.  By this they meant that it opposed the Christian ideal of love and sacrificial service to others.  Strangely and unfortunately, sixty-three years later there is a segment of the American Christian population that is attracted to Ayn Rand&#8217;s ideas, and sadly, it is doubtful that Hollywood still associates Christianity with sacrificial love.

280666,A1QIL7847ET6HX,6301969294,xxgrendelxx,"[8, 18]","I'll be honest and clear: I can't stand Ayn Rand. Her philosphy of the self-interested life may have had value in the Stalinist Russia from whence she came, but in the Western world it merely gives the hubristic and self-absorbed an excuse to be obnoxiously self-righteous.She came over here and started telling the wealthy and greedy they had a right to swindle everyone by virtue of their ""gifts"" at the precise time when regular folks were attempting to carve a slice of the American dream for themselves and found they were being robbed by the ""elite"". In person to person conversation her ideas were discovered to be ill-founded and non-sensical; just ask her best friends and lovers: their opinions are published.Like many of the self-interested self-righteous (Objectivists, Satanists, Social Darwinists) she was obviously, simply, a broken-hearted idealist turned sour and mean. People like Rand think of the world as the 'Wild-West' and believe they could survive there. More sensibly, other's prefer to live in a society - for better or worse but assured of a chance to succeed. Rand didn't understand: she came from Russia.So, it is hilarious to watch ""The Fountainhead"" and listen to actual human beings spout her drivel with a straight face. I understand she wrote the script herself. What she may not have realised, coming from Russia and being as utterly ignorant of American pop-culture as she was of American history, is that her protagonist's antagonists, those altering ""Roark""'s edifices, come across like Republic serial villains - minus the giant saws, rope and railroad tracks.It really is that bad and funny. I'm paraphrasing of course, but it's like ""Mu-hu-hu-ha-ha! You thought you were God's gift to architecture; I'll add terraces to your office building, Roark, and there's nothing you can do to stop me!""The film will make you glad that actual adults don't behave like ""Roark"" and the rest of the cast. Their behavior belongs to some special corner of unreality where airships fill the sky side by side with autogyros and Hercules (spruce goose) model aircraft over bottom-lit skyscraping pylons and perispheres; a world of flamboyant extravagance in both style and emotion - a world that would, if it did exist as Rand surely would have desired it to, be on the fast track to destruction for it's stubborn adherence to ideology over compromise and self-righteousness over understanding... kind of like Soviet Russia.Hmmmm...But that's what you get when a Stalin-era Russian drops herself smack into the middle of a society she doesn't understand and doesn't know the background of and presumes to tell how to run itself.Blowing up buildings on principal? Adherence to ideology to the death? I think that's the turn-of-the-century Russian anarchist in Rand clawing to get out *laughs*.Absurd.Anyhow, Alan Greenspan was a friend and acolyte of Rand and he himself, in the wake of the recent world-wide banking/investment disaster, has admitted before Congress that the personal philosphies he adhered to for a lifetime were flawed and their implementation has just about wrecked the economies of a large percentage of the earth's nations.Thanks for nothing, Ayn, except your silly movie.",5,Unintentionally Funny as Hell!,1273276800,"05 8, 2010",2010,3216,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'clear', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'philosphy', 'self-interested', 'life', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'value', 'Stalinist', 'Russia', 'whence', 'came', 'Western', 'world', 'merely', 'hubristic', 'self-absorbed', 'excuse', 'be', 'obnoxiously', 'self-righteous.She', 'came', 'here', 'started', 'telling', 'wealthy', 'greedy', 'had', 'right', 'swindle', 'everyone', 'virtue', 'gifts', 'precise', 'time', 'when', 'regular', 'folks', 'were', 'attempting', 'carve', 'slice', 'American', 'dream', 'found', 'were', 'being', 'robbed', 'elite', 'person', 'person', 'conversation', 'ideas', 'were', 'discovered', 'be', 'ill-founded', 'non-sensical', 'just', 'ask', 'best', 'friends', 'lovers', 'opinions', 'are', 'published.Like', 'many', 'self-interested', 'self-righteous', 'Objectivists', 'Satanists', 'Social', 'Darwinists', 'was', 'obviously', 'simply', 'broken-hearted', 'idealist', 'turned', 'sour', 'mean', 'People', 'Rand', 'think', 'world', ""'Wild-West"", 'believe', 'could', 'survive', 'there', 'More', 'sensibly', 'other', 'prefer', 'live', 'society', 'better', 'worse', 'assured', 'chance', 'succeed', 'Rand', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'came', 'Russia.So', 'hilarious', 'watch', 'Fountainhead', 'listen', 'actual', 'human', 'beings', 'drivel', 'straight', 'face', 'understand', 'wrote', 'script', 'What', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'realised', 'coming', 'Russia', 'being', 'utterly', 'ignorant', 'American', 'pop-culture', 'was', 'American', 'history', 'protagonist', 'antagonists', 'altering', 'Roark', 'edifices', 'come', 'Republic', 'serial', 'villains', 'giant', 'saws', 'rope', 'railroad', 'tracks.It', 'really', 'bad', 'funny', ""'m"", 'paraphrasing', 'course', 'Mu-hu-hu-ha-ha', 'thought', 'were', 'God', 'gift', 'architecture', ""'ll"", 'add', 'terraces', 'office', 'building', 'Roark', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'stop', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'glad', 'actual', 'adults', 'do', ""n't"", 'behave', 'Roark', 'rest', 'cast', 'behavior', 'belongs', 'special', 'corner', 'unreality', 'where', 'airships', 'fill', 'sky', 'side', 'side', 'autogyros', 'Hercules', 'spruce', 'goose', 'model', 'aircraft', 'bottom-lit', 'skyscraping', 'pylons', 'perispheres', 'world', 'flamboyant', 'extravagance', 'style', 'emotion', 'world', 'would', 'did', 'exist', 'Rand', 'surely', 'would', 'have', 'desired', 'be', 'fast', 'track', 'destruction', 'stubborn', 'adherence', 'ideology', 'compromise', 'self-righteousness', 'understanding', 'kind', 'Soviet', 'Russia.Hmmmm', 'what', 'get', 'when', 'Stalin-era', 'Russian', 'smack', 'middle', 'society', ""n't"", 'understand', ""n't"", 'know', 'background', 'presumes', 'tell', 'how', 'run', 'itself.Blowing', 'up', 'buildings', 'principal', 'Adherence', 'ideology', 'death', 'think', 'turn-of-the-century', 'Russian', 'anarchist', 'Rand', 'clawing', 'get', 'out', '*laughs*.Absurd.Anyhow', 'Alan', 'Greenspan', 'was', 'friend', 'acolyte', 'Rand', 'wake', 'recent', 'world-wide', 'banking/investment', 'disaster', 'admitted', 'Congress', 'personal', 'philosphies', 'adhered', 'lifetime', 'were', 'flawed', 'implementation', 'just', 'about', 'wrecked', 'economies', 'large', 'percentage', 'earth', 'nations.Thanks', 'nothing', 'Ayn', 'silly', 'movie']",The Fountainhead VHS
