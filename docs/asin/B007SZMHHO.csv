It was so slow moving and a little on the boring and long side. If it would have had more background -i probably would have given it five star. Husband did not like at all. After watching the special features I understood the movie a little more-but it would have been nice to &#34;get into&#34; the movie while i was watching it.I did LOVE the message. It was a CLEAN movie. Yes it is based on a true story --i really liked that. The production of the movie was good. I just did not really like nor really hate the movie. After i was done with the movie--it just kind of like &#34;ok&#34;--i felt like there should have been more. To me the best part was at the end of the movie-i started to feel for the characters -which kind of makes it hard-cause by then ..its the end.I guess the thing was -the word WESTERN brings up a certain kind of movie to mind--kind of like John Wayne, or Have gun will travel. This MOVIE IS NOT like that kind of western. This is more like -how it probably was back then -more truer to what actually the west was like--which really does not make a &#34;GOOD&#34; WESTERN--in my view.I would recommend it ..based on the fact it is a true story. Other than that well, it was &#34;OK&#34;",3,OK movie.

1537573,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B007SZMHHO,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[2, 2]","***PLOT SPOILERS***This is a slow moving western that is perhaps more about forgiveness than redemption. The film is based on a true story, one that was more interesting than the film portrays. This film focuses on the life of Henry Heath (John Freeman) a sheriff in Utah. After they find and convict Jean Baptise (David Stevens) of grave robbing, he is exiled to an island where Henry takes him food and water to the dismay of the people he wronged.The film holds your interest in a minimal sort of way as any docudrama might. I liked the scenery and costumes of the period, but the story was bland.They missed the good historical parts. For instance, Brigham Young had to assure the residents that their loved ones would still rise during the resurrection, even without wearing their clothes. The clothes were not found as the film depicts, but rather stacked neatly and folded in boxes. The clothes were all buried together so they can resurrect with their respective owners.Jean Baptise is seen as dying in the film in an attempt to escape. He apparently did escape and his fate was unknown. I thought history would have made a better ending, but the film maker chose for closure for Henry Heath.The film is light on religion, far less religion than I expected from the title and location.Parental Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",3,"GHOUL IN THE LAKE,",1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,1337,"['***PLOT', 'SPOILERS***This', 'slow', 'moving', 'western', 'perhaps', 'more', 'forgiveness', 'redemption', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'one', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'film', 'portrays', 'film', 'life', 'Henry', 'Heath', 'John', 'Freeman', 'sheriff', 'Utah', 'find', 'convict', 'Jean', 'Baptise', 'David', 'Stevens', 'grave', 'robbing', 'exiled', 'island', 'where', 'Henry', 'food', 'water', 'dismay', 'people', 'film', 'interest', 'minimal', 'sort', 'way', 'docudrama', 'might', 'liked', 'scenery', 'costumes', 'period', 'story', 'was', 'bland.They', 'missed', 'good', 'historical', 'parts', 'instance', 'Brigham', 'Young', 'had', 'assure', 'residents', 'loved', 'ones', 'would', 'still', 'rise', 'resurrection', 'even', 'wearing', 'clothes', 'clothes', 'were', 'not', 'found', 'film', 'depicts', 'rather', 'stacked', 'neatly', 'folded', 'boxes', 'clothes', 'were', 'buried', 'together', 'can', 'resurrect', 'respective', 'owners.Jean', 'Baptise', 'seen', 'dying', 'film', 'attempt', 'escape', 'apparently', 'did', 'escape', 'fate', 'was', 'unknown', 'thought', 'history', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'ending', 'film', 'maker', 'chose', 'closure', 'Henry', 'Heath.The', 'film', 'light', 'religion', 'far', 'less', 'religion', 'expected', 'title', 'location.Parental', 'Guide', 'swearing', 'sex', 'nudity']",N/A
