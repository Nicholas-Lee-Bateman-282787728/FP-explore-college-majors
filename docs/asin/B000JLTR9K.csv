1028187,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000JLTR9K,B. E Jackson,"[0, 2]","The Darkroom is one of those movies that's honestly really *really* bad in every conceivable way, but for some really mysterious reason... I can't bring myself to criticize it because on some unexplainably deep personal level, I actually enjoyed it.First of all, the acting.  It's horrendous.  Actually what makes the acting so terrible is the way each of the main characters delivers his or her line.  After delivering it, there's an odd moment of noticeable silence.  This probably has less to do with the actual acting itself and more of an inexperience level on the part of the writers for not realizing when to trim the fat, so to speak, so as a result some segments linger longer than they honestly should.A good example is right in the very beginning when the teenage boy is talking to a guy in a diner who just escaped from an asylum.  In addition to these scenes carrying on longer than necessary, what's most awkward about them is the way you hear silence after every line.  Almost like you're hearing the wind blow in the background.  It gives the entire movie a low budget feel.The storyline actually isn't terrible, and has potential (and even achieves its potential in a few spots).  It's fairly well-written and, though entirely cheesy, isn't without its moments.  The writers were at least trying for something here.You better believe the actual ""scary monster"" is nothing more than a pitiful attempt and scaring the viewers by having some guy dress in a costume and making the camera jerk around in dizzy fashion in order to give off some fears.  This is hilarious.What won me over (actually I mean, what makes me feel guilty about winning me over) is the actual ""dark room"" itself.  The teenage boys stepdad has a dark secret, and that secret is revealed inside of this room.  There actually was a nice bit of atmosphere building up to the mystery of what's located inside the room between the supposed ""evil"" stepdad, the eager-to-discover teenage boy, and the drunk mother.  Every time the boy wanted to find out what's inside, something would prevent him from doing so.  I enjoyed these segments.By the way, how hilarious is it that the teenage boy kept claiming his stepfather was a jerk, only to have him be nothing but!  He actually came across as extremely polite and considerate, trying to help his family the best way he can.  FAR from being a jerk of any sorts.However, the film completely misses the mark in being truly terrifying.  No, that bigfoot-like ""bad guy"" creature running around town in a costume is definitely NOT scary, haha.Overall, yes, it's amazingly corny, but it actually is worth watching on some level of desperation, lol.",4,it's... worth watching (wow did I just recommend this?),1286841600,"10 12, 2010",2010,2670,"['Darkroom', 'one', 'movies', 'honestly', 'really', '*really*', 'bad', 'conceivable', 'way', 'really', 'mysterious', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'criticize', 'unexplainably', 'deep', 'personal', 'level', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'it.First', 'acting', 'horrendous', 'Actually', 'what', 'acting', 'so', 'terrible', 'way', 'main', 'characters', 'line', 'delivering', 'odd', 'moment', 'noticeable', 'silence', 'probably', 'less', 'do', 'actual', 'acting', 'more', 'inexperience', 'level', 'part', 'writers', 'not', 'realizing', 'when', 'trim', 'fat', 'so', 'speak', 'so', 'result', 'segments', 'linger', 'longer', 'honestly', 'should.A', 'good', 'example', 'right', 'very', 'beginning', 'when', 'teenage', 'boy', 'talking', 'guy', 'diner', 'who', 'just', 'escaped', 'asylum', 'addition', 'scenes', 'carrying', 'longer', 'necessary', 'what', 'most', 'awkward', 'way', 'hear', 'silence', 'line', ""'re"", 'hearing', 'wind', 'blow', 'background', 'entire', 'movie', 'low', 'budget', 'feel.The', 'storyline', 'actually', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'potential', 'even', 'potential', 'few', 'spots', 'fairly', 'well-written', 'though', 'entirely', 'cheesy', ""n't"", 'moments', 'writers', 'were', 'least', 'trying', 'something', 'here.You', 'better', 'believe', 'actual', 'scary', 'monster', 'nothing', 'more', 'pitiful', 'attempt', 'scaring', 'viewers', 'having', 'guy', 'dress', 'costume', 'making', 'camera', 'jerk', 'dizzy', 'fashion', 'order', 'give', 'off', 'fears', 'won', 'actually', 'mean', 'what', 'feel', 'guilty', 'winning', 'actual', 'dark', 'room', 'teenage', 'stepdad', 'dark', 'secret', 'secret', 'revealed', 'inside', 'room', 'actually', 'was', 'nice', 'bit', 'atmosphere', 'building', 'up', 'mystery', 'what', 'located', 'room', 'supposed', 'evil', 'stepdad', 'eager-to-discover', 'teenage', 'boy', 'drunk', 'mother', 'time', 'boy', 'wanted', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'inside', 'something', 'would', 'prevent', 'doing', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'segments.By', 'way', 'how', 'hilarious', 'teenage', 'boy', 'kept', 'claiming', 'stepfather', 'was', 'jerk', 'only', 'have', 'be', 'nothing', 'actually', 'came', 'extremely', 'polite', 'considerate', 'trying', 'help', 'family', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'FAR', 'being', 'jerk', 'sorts.However', 'film', 'completely', 'mark', 'being', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'No', 'bigfoot-like', 'bad', 'guy', 'creature', 'running', 'around', 'town', 'costume', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'scary', 'haha.Overall', 'yes', 'amazingly', 'corny', 'actually', 'worth', 'watching', 'level', 'desperation', 'lol']",Dark Room

Corpier,"[4, 5]",What we have here is the interesting story of a man who has been in a mental institution for the past 15 yeas after he was found on the side of the road covered in blood and no memory of who he was. He later escapes and befriends a young boy who needs help dealing with his problems with his step father (played by the mind reading cop from Heroes) and an alcoholic mother (played by Xena star Lucy Lawless who I barely recognized) ooh and there is that pesky mud covered monster that the guy keeps on seeing that is hacking everyone around him to death and a twist that you can really see coming.The truth is I really liked this flick It has everything that I really enjoy. The main thing is the fact that there were no cheesy effects and they got aot on names to be in the flick that helped the movie and I likes seeing the cop from Heroes play a villain. Now the only drawback is the surprise ending let's face it we live in the era of flicks like the Sixth Sense and Fight Club where we see the shocking twist and when it is not built up we can see it from a mile away. they made one mistake that gave it away but if you're not looking at it as a critic you may miss it. Besides that it was a really good flick and I enjoyed it.There are also some good features on the DVD for example the making of Featurette that does contain spoilers but they do give you a disclaimer before the DVD starts as well as some deleted scenes that made me wonder why they were cut from the film but they may have hurt the flow of he script.I have to also mention that this flick was produced by Mind fire Entertainment that I am going to have to give a call about a job when I go out to LA this year.

The rest of the movie is about the man's, played by Reed Diamond, journey to recover his lost memories, and Stanley's quest to find out what his father is up too.Lucy Lawless --everyones favorite warrior princess/Cylon -- plays the alcoholic mother, a victim of abuse, which is quite a different role than we are used to seeing from Lawless; she does it well.  Greg Grunberg --Alias's Eric Weiss, and Heroes Matt Parkman, also plays a very good, and different role than he has played in the past.  In this movie he is the sadistic husband of Lucy Lawless. The acting is great, the plot isn't the most original, nor all that scary, but is entertaining, and stays interesting throughout its length.This is a straight to DVD release.

Mysteries abound in Stanley's life.  What is the slimy thing killing all the transients?  What is in Bob's darkroom?  And what was up with that experimental drug?Like so many of these movies that want to have their horror cake and eat it too, The Darkroom substitutes flashbacks of disturbing scenes for dramatic narrative.  The acting is atrocious - Pyfrom isn't very good, Diamond is a walking zombie, Grunberg is an over-the-top jerk, and Lucy Lawless has nothing to do as Stanley's mom except lounge around in lingerie.  Which is really the only highlight.The mystery, if you can call it that, deepens as Stanley and The Man decide to follow Bob to work.  It turns out Bob hasn't been going to work for weeks, but he does go somewhere and it involves a camera.  Three guesses as to who the slime monster is and what's in the darkroom and the first two don't count.And that's the thing - as a mystery, The Darkroom fails because the flashbacks give it away.  As a psychological thriller, The Darkroom resorts to cheap thrills of torture and nudity. The Darkroom's monster looks ridiculous. And the pat explanation for who The Man really is simply isn't airtight or interesting enough to warrant another viewing.In short, we know what's precisely in The Darkroom: a scattered mess of blurry shots, flashbacks, drippy monsters, bad special effects, and wooden acting, all topped with a lame plot twist.
