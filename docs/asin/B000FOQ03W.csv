This helped me to better understand the Koran.  It is one thing to have read the Koran, it is another to have it explained (such as it were) by Muslims and scholars.  All in all, this was a very informative, well presented look into the Koran and Islam; where it came from and where it may go in the future.",5,Fascinating,1169078400,"01 18, 2007",2007,388,"['Having', 'watched', 'when', 'aired', 'television', 'had', 'decided', 'had', 'own', 'helped', 'better', 'understand', 'Koran', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'read', 'Koran', 'have', 'explained', 'such', 'were', 'Muslims', 'scholars', 'was', 'very', 'informative', 'well', 'presented', 'look', 'Koran', 'Islam', 'where', 'came', 'where', 'may', 'go', 'future']",Decoding the Past: Secrets of the Koran

993508,ADOZJJSJ9R5XI,B000FOQ03W,Kim Boykin,"[49, 55]","I'm very pleased with this DVD, which actually contains two programs: ""Secrets of the Koran"" and, as a bonus feature, ""Muhammad"" from A&E;'s ""Biography"" series. I've used excerpts from both of these programs in teaching world religions in college and high school. Both programs honor the Muslim tradition of not depicting Muhammad or members of his immediate family.""SECRETS OF THE KORAN"" (91 min.) is an excellent documentary on the history of the Koran and its interpretation. Topics include the religious and social milieu into which Muhammad was born; the life of Muhammad and the revelation of the verses of the Koran; the early Muslim community; the compilation of the Koran; the Koran's relationship to Jewish and Christian revelations; the Muslim understanding of the apocalypse and judgment; difficulties in the interpretation of the Koran; jihad; the Koran's emphasis on the value of knowledge; the golden age of Islam; the Crusades; Islamic fundamentalism; and violent vs. peaceful understandings of the message of the Koran.""MUHAMMAD"" (42 min.) isn't a biography precisely. Rather, it's a presentation of the traditional story of the life of Muhammad, with commentary by scholars who are Muslim or sympathetic to Islam (including two of the usual suspects, Karen Armstrong and John Esposito). This program does a good job of bringing the story of Muhammad to life, and because it's so concise, it may be more useful in my teaching than ""The Message"" (a three-hour movie about the life of Muhammad), which is also good.Some other good videos on Islam:-Inside Islam(History Channel);-Muslims(Frontline);-Inside Mecca(National Geographic);-Islamic Mysticism: The Sufi Way, narrated by Huston Smith.",5,Introductions to the message and Messenger of Islam,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,1707,"[""'m"", 'very', 'pleased', 'DVD', 'actually', 'two', 'programs', 'Secrets', 'Koran', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Muhammad', 'A', 'E', 'Biography', 'series', ""'ve"", 'used', 'excerpts', 'programs', 'teaching', 'world', 'religions', 'college', 'high', 'school', 'programs', 'honor', 'Muslim', 'tradition', 'not', 'depicting', 'Muhammad', 'members', 'immediate', 'family', 'SECRETS', 'THE', 'KORAN', '91', 'min', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'history', 'Koran', 'interpretation', 'Topics', 'include', 'religious', 'social', 'milieu', 'Muhammad', 'was', 'born', 'life', 'Muhammad', 'revelation', 'verses', 'Koran', 'early', 'Muslim', 'community', 'compilation', 'Koran', 'Koran', 'relationship', 'Jewish', 'Christian', 'revelations', 'Muslim', 'understanding', 'apocalypse', 'judgment', 'difficulties', 'interpretation', 'Koran', 'jihad', 'Koran', 'emphasis', 'value', 'knowledge', 'golden', 'age', 'Islam', 'Crusades', 'Islamic', 'fundamentalism', 'violent', 'vs.', 'peaceful', 'understandings', 'message', 'Koran', 'MUHAMMAD', '42', 'min', ""n't"", 'biography', 'precisely', 'Rather', 'presentation', 'traditional', 'story', 'life', 'Muhammad', 'commentary', 'scholars', 'who', 'are', 'Muslim', 'sympathetic', 'Islam', 'including', 'two', 'usual', 'suspects', 'Karen', 'Armstrong', 'John', 'Esposito', 'program', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'story', 'Muhammad', 'life', 'so', 'concise', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'useful', 'teaching', 'Message', 'three-hour', 'movie', 'life', 'Muhammad', 'also', 'good.Some', 'other', 'good', 'videos', 'Islam', '-Inside', 'Islam', 'History', 'Channel', '-Muslims', 'Frontline', 'Mecca', 'National', 'Geographic', '-Islamic', 'Mysticism', 'Sufi', 'Way', 'narrated', 'Huston', 'Smith']",Decoding the Past: Secrets of the Koran
993509,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B000FOQ03W,maskirovka,"[15, 31]","I was disappointed by this DVD set.  I couldn't help but think that the producers just about turned back-flips to white-wash some of the less pleasant aspects of Islamic history and the Koran.  For example, very little was said about the concept of jihad and what the Koran says about it.  For another example, the DVD featured an interview with John Esposito, who has been accused by more than a few people of excessively downplaying the Koran's more bellicose verses.  I don't have a problem with hearing from Esposito, who is obviously a learned man, but for balance there should have been someone like Bernard Lewis or even Daniel Pipes presenting a critical view.Overall, the DVD set didn't have much more knowledge than I think one would get from perhaps taking an ""Islam 101"" course in college.  As such, it's not worth the price one has to pay to buy it here.One final observation:  it was fascinating to hear that Muslims essentially believe that Christianity and Judaism's sacred books are distortions of the true word of God (which prompted God to reveal the Koran to Mohammed).  I have no problem with this interpretation of things by them, but I can't help but note that Salman Rushdie's satirical ""Satanic Verses"" which suggested much the same thing about the Koran prompted murderous outbursts of violence and a fatwa calling for the death of the author from Ayatollah Khomeini that remains in force to this day.  It's my belief that this speaks volumes about ""tolerance"" displayed by many Muslims (that they expect people to ignore what they say about competitor faiths like Judaism and Christianity but erupt in fury or worse if someone doubts the authenticity of their faith).",2,Pretty Superficial and Slanted,1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,1694,"['was', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'set', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'producers', 'just', 'about', 'turned', 'back-flips', 'white-wash', 'less', 'pleasant', 'aspects', 'Islamic', 'history', 'Koran', 'example', 'very', 'little', 'was', 'said', 'concept', 'jihad', 'what', 'Koran', 'example', 'DVD', 'featured', 'interview', 'John', 'Esposito', 'who', 'been', 'accused', 'more', 'few', 'people', 'excessively', 'downplaying', 'Koran', 'more', 'bellicose', 'verses', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'hearing', 'Esposito', 'who', 'obviously', 'learned', 'man', 'balance', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'someone', 'Bernard', 'Lewis', 'even', 'Daniel', 'Pipes', 'presenting', 'critical', 'view.Overall', 'DVD', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'more', 'knowledge', 'think', 'one', 'would', 'get', 'perhaps', 'taking', 'Islam', '101', 'course', 'college', 'such', 'not', 'worth', 'price', 'one', 'pay', 'buy', 'here.One', 'final', 'observation', 'was', 'fascinating', 'hear', 'Muslims', 'essentially', 'believe', 'Christianity', 'Judaism', 'sacred', 'books', 'are', 'distortions', 'true', 'word', 'God', 'prompted', 'God', 'reveal', 'Koran', 'Mohammed', 'have', 'problem', 'interpretation', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'note', 'Salman', 'Rushdie', 'satirical', 'Satanic', 'Verses', 'suggested', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'Koran', 'prompted', 'murderous', 'outbursts', 'violence', 'fatwa', 'calling', 'death', 'author', 'Ayatollah', 'Khomeini', 'force', 'day', 'belief', 'volumes', 'tolerance', 'displayed', 'many', 'Muslims', 'expect', 'people', 'ignore', 'what', 'say', 'competitor', 'faiths', 'Judaism', 'Christianity', 'erupt', 'fury', 'worse', 'someone', 'authenticity', 'faith']",Decoding the Past: Secrets of the Koran
993510,A3GG91QZH5FQJ4,B000FOQ03W,S.,"[9, 10]","""Decoding The Past: Secrets Of The Koran"" is a good documentary covering all the basics of the Holy book of Islam.  Additionally, a biography of prophet Muhammad is included as a special feature, which I thought was a welcome bonus.The Secrets Of The Koran is a well done, well researched DVD, covering most of the questions a typical Westerner might have about Islam's interpretation of this holy text.  One thing I found appealing is the fact that the program addresses extremism in Islam, and explains how the fundamentalists take the verses of the Koran out of context by reading incomplete verses that suit the extremists' purposes.The biography of Muhammad was much more tame, and exceptionally politically correct.  The biography itself was rather short and covered the basics of the prophet's life, also concentrating on Islam as a whole, and reverting back to the Koran.  I expected the program to be more about the prophet himself, as the original Secrets Of The Koran already covered other aspects.I do recommend this DVD as a starting point for anyone who has no knowledge of the Koran or prophet Muhammed.  Very educational and to the point, it leaves one with many questions to be answered through further research.",4,Basic Overview,1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,1229,"['Decoding', 'Past', 'Secrets', 'Koran', 'good', 'documentary', 'covering', 'basics', 'Holy', 'book', 'Islam', 'Additionally', 'biography', 'prophet', 'Muhammad', 'included', 'special', 'feature', 'thought', 'was', 'welcome', 'bonus.The', 'Secrets', 'Koran', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'researched', 'DVD', 'covering', 'most', 'questions', 'typical', 'Westerner', 'might', 'have', 'Islam', 'interpretation', 'holy', 'text', 'One', 'thing', 'found', 'appealing', 'fact', 'program', 'extremism', 'Islam', 'how', 'fundamentalists', 'take', 'verses', 'Koran', 'context', 'reading', 'incomplete', 'verses', 'suit', 'extremists', 'purposes.The', 'biography', 'Muhammad', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'tame', 'exceptionally', 'politically', 'correct', 'biography', 'was', 'rather', 'short', 'covered', 'basics', 'prophet', 'life', 'also', 'concentrating', 'Islam', 'whole', 'reverting', 'back', 'Koran', 'expected', 'program', 'be', 'more', 'prophet', 'original', 'Secrets', 'Koran', 'already', 'covered', 'other', 'aspects.I', 'do', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'starting', 'point', 'anyone', 'who', 'knowledge', 'Koran', 'prophet', 'Muhammed', 'Very', 'educational', 'point', 'one', 'many', 'questions', 'be', 'answered', 'further', 'research']",Decoding the Past: Secrets of the Koran
