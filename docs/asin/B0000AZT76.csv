769467,A17NB397AH144H,B0000AZT76,ACS,"[3, 5]","In this movie, a remake of the 1971 Daniel Mann film, Crispin Glover stars as Willard Stiles, a lonely, slightly unhinged, loser who trains an army of rats to do his bidding.  Although it has a few flaws, Willard is a highly entertaining film, and definitely worth the price of admission.Willard has a go-nowhere job at Martin-Stiles Manufacturing, which was co-founded by his now-deceased father.  The company is now run by its tyrant co-founder Frank Martin, played by R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket).  As the story unfolds, we learn that Martin bought out the shares of the elder Mr. Stiles, who, for reasons that aren't fully explained, later committed suicide.  As a part of the contract, Willard was promised a job for life.  Predictably, though, as soon as Willard's mother dies, Martin fires him.  At that point, Willard completely loses his mind and the real action begins.In the beginning, the film is a little hard to get into because the premise of the movie is, well, preposterous.  As the film opens, Willard is seen trying to exterminate a white rat that he found living in his basement.  Willard has second thoughts about killing him, though, so he befriends the little guy and names him ""Socrates.""  He then begins to train thousands of Socrates' cohorts (including the nearly dog-sized ""Ben"") to do all kinds of neat tricks, like climbing into briefcases and chewing things on command.  In what seems like just a few minutes, the rats have become a well-trained army of furry little soldiers, ready and willing to do whatever Willard asks.  As a viewer, you're left wondering why the rats suddenly agree to submit to Willard's control.  But Glover really sells it and, later on at least, it doesn't seem so unbelievable.In fact, the acting is pretty good across the board.  Glover's performance is excellent throughout.  Most people probably remember him from his role as George McFly in Back to the Future.  He doesn't stray too far from the McFly persona in Willard, but it still works: he is totally believable as the crazy Willard.  Ermey is also effective, but perhaps a little too over-the-top, as Willard's abusive boss.  Ermey is probably best known as the former real-life Marine who played the drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket, a role that he has played (unintentionally at times) in about a hundred other movies since then.  He essentially reprises his part in FMJ here; in fact, through the whole movie, you're half expecting him to call Willard a ""panty waste"" or something.Despite a few shortcomings here and there, Willard is an effective and enjoyable film.  A warning is in order, though: this movie is not for the squeamish and definitely not for children.  In fact, some of it is downright painful to watch.  The violence inflicted on animals in a couple of scenes is pretty harsh, even for hardened horror-film fans.  But if you enjoy a good psychological thriller, you'll find Willard well worth the price of admission.

769469,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0000AZT76,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Willard is a very special kind of horror in that it's SO absurd and SO crazy that there's basically unintentional elements of comedy constantly coming around for another surprise, however that's not all. There's also bits of extreme dark horror that involve torment.  However because of the humor, you don't really notice how evil it is that these rats are literally torturing people (and sometimes cats) and just assume it's somewhat funny instead.  It's just a weird movie overall!It's about a man who has the worst boss in the world.  Now people say they have the worst boss but come on, this one is CLEARLY the unfriendliest and unlikeliest to sympathesize with your issues at home.  He actually humiliates his employees despite the fact that even death itself is preventing one man (the character of Willard) to show up to work on time.  Humiliating the poor man because he shows up late to work because his mother is dying?  Really cruel man.  You're out of line!However, let's discuss Willard.  What is he?  Well he's obviously a loner and prefers to seclude himself at his castle-like home away from society when he's not working and putting up with crazy, bossy authority abuse.  He really has no interest in friendships or relationships of any kind with anyone.  In fact, I don't even believe he likes his own mother and the feeling is mutual for the way she treats him and basically says he's not man enough to do anything right.  What kind of loving caring mother would say these outrageous comments?  Not this mother obviously, since she's not the loving caring type in any shape or form!After a terrible attempt at catching mice and rats, Willard realizes that he can actually communicate with the rats.  Oh yes he has this amazing ability.  We all believe we can communicate with the animals but this guy proves it with flying colors.  He uses this communication for vindictive ways.  Oh and you can probably guess who he wants to get his revenge on, right?  Yup, the man who wants him removed from the workplace.  That plan comes together quite nicely and suspensefully.These rats grow by the numbers gradually by sneaking into the house, and bonding with the other rats.  They mostly live in the basement but when they grow plentiful enough, they spread their sinister ways throughout the household.  Willard particularly likes one rat that's pure white.  Never really sure if he was the rat in charge or whether Willard's imagination in peculiar rat heaven just makes it *seem* like the white one is in charge.  He was a beautiful rat that gave off heavenly vibes thanks to his exceptionally bright fur so maybe he was the king descendant!I really like this movie.  Though at first we're not really sure if the rats are able to understand what's going through the troubled mine of Willard, but we eventually get our definitive answer with a loud rour when the blood starts squirting and the rats are released!  These rats are on a mission to eliminate or rather, exterminate, hehe.I highly recommend it.",5,"oh rats, they're growing by the dozen!",1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,3021,"['Willard', 'very', 'special', 'kind', 'horror', 'SO', 'absurd', 'SO', 'crazy', 'basically', 'unintentional', 'elements', 'comedy', 'constantly', 'coming', 'around', 'surprise', 'however', 'not', 'also', 'bits', 'extreme', 'dark', 'horror', 'involve', 'torment', 'However', 'humor', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'notice', 'how', 'evil', 'rats', 'are', 'literally', 'torturing', 'people', 'sometimes', 'cats', 'just', 'assume', 'somewhat', 'funny', 'instead', 'just', 'weird', 'movie', 'overall', 'man', 'who', 'worst', 'boss', 'world', 'Now', 'people', 'say', 'have', 'worst', 'boss', 'come', 'one', 'CLEARLY', 'unfriendliest', 'unlikeliest', 'sympathesize', 'issues', 'home', 'actually', 'employees', 'fact', 'even', 'death', 'preventing', 'one', 'man', 'character', 'Willard', 'show', 'up', 'work', 'time', 'Humiliating', 'poor', 'man', 'up', 'late', 'work', 'mother', 'dying', 'Really', 'cruel', 'man', ""'re"", 'line', 'However', 'let', 'discuss', 'Willard', 'What', 'Well', 'obviously', 'loner', 'prefers', 'seclude', 'castle-like', 'home', 'away', 'society', 'when', 'not', 'working', 'putting', 'up', 'crazy', 'bossy', 'authority', 'abuse', 'really', 'interest', 'friendships', 'relationships', 'kind', 'anyone', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'believe', 'own', 'mother', 'feeling', 'mutual', 'way', 'basically', 'not', 'man', 'enough', 'do', 'anything', 'right', 'What', 'kind', 'loving', 'caring', 'mother', 'would', 'say', 'outrageous', 'comments', 'Not', 'mother', 'obviously', 'not', 'loving', 'caring', 'type', 'shape', 'form', 'terrible', 'attempt', 'catching', 'mice', 'rats', 'Willard', 'can', 'actually', 'communicate', 'rats', 'Oh', 'yes', 'amazing', 'ability', 'believe', 'can', 'communicate', 'animals', 'guy', 'flying', 'colors', 'communication', 'vindictive', 'ways', 'Oh', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'who', 'get', 'revenge', 'right', 'Yup', 'man', 'who', 'removed', 'workplace', 'plan', 'together', 'quite', 'nicely', 'suspensefully.These', 'rats', 'grow', 'numbers', 'gradually', 'sneaking', 'house', 'bonding', 'other', 'rats', 'mostly', 'live', 'basement', 'when', 'grow', 'plentiful', 'enough', 'spread', 'sinister', 'ways', 'household', 'Willard', 'particularly', 'one', 'rat', 'pure', 'white', 'Never', 'really', 'sure', 'was', 'rat', 'charge', 'Willard', 'imagination', 'peculiar', 'rat', 'heaven', 'just', 'white', 'one', 'charge', 'was', 'beautiful', 'rat', 'gave', 'off', 'heavenly', 'vibes', 'thanks', 'exceptionally', 'bright', 'fur', 'so', 'maybe', 'was', 'king', 'descendant', 'really', 'movie', 'first', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'rats', 'are', 'able', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'troubled', 'mine', 'Willard', 'eventually', 'get', 'definitive', 'answer', 'loud', 'rour', 'when', 'blood', 'squirting', 'rats', 'are', 'released', 'rats', 'are', 'mission', 'eliminate', 'rather', 'exterminate', 'hehe.I', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A
769470,AR37967IAR6ZT,B0000AZT76,Benjamin,"[16, 18]","""Willard,"" with Crispin Glover in the title role, was a more creepy, atmospheric film than a general horror film. At no time while watching it did I really ever feel scared, which disappointed me. I wanted, you know, to jump at least once, and you'd figure that'd be par for the course in a film filled with so many rats. But it didn't happen, for it turns out that the ""Willard"" remake doesn't aspire to be that kind of horror movie. It's more ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Psycho"" than ""Urban Legend,"" thank God.The constantly underrated, creepy Crispin Glover is absolutely perfect in the title role, reminiscent of Anthony Perkins, as a browbeaten man who turns to friendship with rats in order to find acceptance and later exact revenge on those who've wronged him. The film, on the whole, is macabre in its costuming, set design and even its opening credits. The production value is noticeably high.The supporting cast is very strong, including Jackie Burroughs as Willard's half-decomposed, senile mother and Laura Elena Harring as the girl who tries to care for Willard. Still, R. Lee Ermey steals every scene he's in as Willard's belligerent, evil boss. His demise, fittingly, is the visual and emotional climax of the film.The ending of the movie pays homage to ""Psycho,"" and the original ""Willard,"" which I've not seen, gets its due by featuring Bruce Davison in portraits as Willard's father.

769471,A1ZDEH3V0H290C,B0000AZT76,"Betty ""diverduck""","[0, 0]","This is a great film if you loved the original. I haven't seen the original since the 70's, so I can only recall the highlights from it. Crispin Glover is outstanding as Willard. He handles the white rats (Socrates) like he really loves him as a best friend. He even gives Socrates a kiss before hiding him in his desk drawer at work. There is a great a scene of him rescuing Socrates from a glue rattrap with vegetable oil in the bathroom late at night, while his elderly mother is banging on the door asking yet again if there are rats. He makes up random excuses, but nothing satisfies her until Willard can only think to answer her that he's sick and going ""potty"". She isn't satisfied and still wants in, declaring she's still his mother and wants to see it. Willard rolls his eyes and sighs with exasperation as he pries the rat loose from the trap, wraps it in a towel, hides it and walks his mother to her room. She notices something on his hand and he tells her it's soap. She cries out that it's cooking oil and tells him he's too old for that business and he needs to get a girl. Willard is next seen with the white rat perched on his hand, combing its fur and naming him Socrates...his substitute girlfriend. That is until a pretty new temp named Cathryn at the office takes up interest in him. Crispin and Laura Harring is a delightful mismatched pair. She reaches out to him so tenderly and Willard hasn't had anyone be that kind to him since his father died. Crispin plays this uncomfortable, yet nice, new attention from a young female with lovely awkwardness.Crispin is a believable advisory of the huge rat ""Ben,"" even in moments when Ben can't be seen, just traces of Ben's defiance against him. Like when Willard brings a silver parrot head walking cane to bed with him to protect himself against the huge rat. He wakes to find Ben has chewed up the entire wood portion of the cane, leaving the silver parrot head next to him (very God Father part 1)...Willard looked horrified. When he turns his head and finds Ben sitting on the other side of the bed, he is terrified...than panicked when he can't figure out how he got into his room, because Willard went to a lot of trouble to ""Ben--proof"" it.The set that was built for Willard and his Mother's home is sumptuous and rich with detail. It looks like they found a 100-year-old mansion to film this in. Gorgeous wood beam ceilings down stairs with high ceilings (cathedral ceilings in the foyer and his father's study). Wood wainscoting almost as tall as Crispin's shoulders thru out the entire set. Entire rooms paneled in a beautiful pattern of wood (including a bathroom), oak like wood floors and wall light switches that look ancient. Also a huge burnt umber glass chandler with one light bulb burnt out over the foyer is a subtle character in itself. Stained glass windows through out the set, wallpaper of someone's ingenious imagination, a beautiful enamel hand painted anniversary clock is used a few times in scenes and in one scene to show Willard standing at the bottom his staircase, too scared to move over a period of 10 hours very affectively. There is also a huge creepy basement where a lot of action takes place with the rats. Art direction went above and beyond for this film and it pays off so well.R.Lee Ermey is the boss from hell in the character Mr. Martin and the art direction helps show his contempt for his lowly employee Willard Stiles, whom his father use to own half the company. As we see Willard go to work for our first time, he must pass thru a set of huge gates with the name Martin in shiny, clean letters above the name Stiles in old rusted letters. Willard is 20 minutes late for work and is he going to hear about it! I love that Mr. Martin has a huge brass cheese wedge paperweight on his desk. ""The big cheese,"" nice touch. If you know the original, you'll know Ben causes mutiny...not completely Ben's fault. Glen Morgan pays tribute to Hitchcock's film ""The Birds"" when we see Mr.Martin sitting at his desk in his dark office late at night looking up non-work related web sites. As he is absorbed in the material on his monitor, rats start to line up on the back of his sofa in the dimness. I'm personally terrified of rodents, I guess that's partly why I like this film. The thrill of watching something terrifying to me.The commentary is a pleasure with Director Glen Morgan, Producer James Wong and Actors Crispin Glover and at brief moments R.Lee Ermey. It's fun, informative...they are down to earth and talk about everything from the rats and their handlers, the set, real life stories and experiences that inspired things in the film, specific scenes and what was going on during them, in-between takes, cgi rats, Glen's family, Crispin talking about having to cry real tears and his ""circle of death"" from drama class is funny. It's loaded with terrific moments. I've watched it three times with the commentary since it arrived about a month ago; it's entertaining.",5,Ah!

One day Willard discovers a little pal in the basement of his huge house. It's a white rat! Willard quickly befriends the rodent, naming him Socrates, due to his high intelligence. Soon, more (lots more) furry friends arrive, including Ben, a ten pound sewer rat. Willard is overjoyed to have so many new buddies to hang out with!

Maybe it was the visual of hundreds of rats running around, or maybe it was that great, big one named Big Ben, or Ben for short.  Either way, this isn't a movie for everyone, but then Crispin Glover seems to flourish in offbeat roles.In this movie, he plays the title character, Willard.  Apparently this is a remake/sequel to a movie of the same title released in 1971 staring Bruce Davidson, probably most recognizable as Senator Kelly in the recent X-Men movies.  It's a sequel as Crispin plays the son to the original character, but I think it can also be considered a remake, as I've heard this story seems to follow the original quite closely.Anyway, Willard lives in a great big house caring for his invalid mother.  He always works at the company his father started.  The now owner, Mr. Martin, played by R. Lee Emery (Full Metal Jacket) hates Willard with a passion, but due to a promise he made to Willard's father, he keeps Willard on, but gives him quite a hard time, seeing Willard as a weak link in the company chain.Apparently, there has been recent construction in Willard's neighborhood, and this is causing rats to take refuge in the basement of the home of Willard and his mother.  Willard buys some traps, and captures a white rat.  The rat somehow appeals to him in some way, and Willard ends up saving and keeping him, calling him Socrates and they soon become close friends, Willard allowing Socrates to even sleep in bed with him.  It also seems he and Socrates have a sort of psychic connection in that Willard can give him commands and Socrates complies.  Not only that, but then Socrates seems able to train the other rats to follow suit.  Odd?  Yeah, but just go with it...Soon more and more rats begin to show up, so I would guess that there is a rat grapevine, and news of a rat sanctuary spreads fast.  Among the new rats is a humongous one Willard calls Big Ben, or Ben for short, one I would have probably mistaken for an opossum.  Eventually Willard's life begins to spin out of control, precipitated by a number of events at home and at work, and Willard puts his army of rats to work.  The confrontation scene between Willard and Mr. Martin is truly a gruesome and creepy and contains some really good CGI work, in my opinion.All the supporting actors do a wonderful job, and I really like R. Lee Emery, but I've seen his hardcore persona done in quite a few movies now, and it's starting to get a little old.  The standout in this movie is Crispin Glover, though.  The guy exudes weird like nobody's business, and was truly fun for me to watch.  I really enjoyed the movie throughout, but I knew even before it was released, it would slide under the radar of most people, as it doesn't really have widespread commercial appeal.  That's okay, for as long as Mr. Glover keeps making movies, I will go see them.  I haven't been disappointed in him yet, and I hope for more in the future.New Line has included a number of special features including commentary from the actors and directors, a making of documentary, deleted scenes, storyboards, weblinks, and full and wide screen formats.

769478,A1RRR3ICAMMXV7,B0000AZT76,"Darthjal ""Darthjal""","[1, 2]",".This film is a four-star concept with five-star performances and three-star results (mostly editing-related problems). So... if you're big on concept and don't mind looking at things as they should be, rather than as they are, this movie should make you very happy. But if you don't already love the Willard story or you don't appreciate having to fill in the blanks yourself (most people don't), you might be disappointed.The basic story is similar to the original version of ""Willard,"" but it's a very different take on the character and his situation. The title character in the 1971 film seems quite relaxed, outgoing, and optimistic compared to the nervous Willard of 2003, whose spirit was crushed long ago. His highs are higher and his lows are lower.Actors and rats alike give wonderful (and wonderfully directed) performances. Glover is such a natural as Willard that I'm shocked he wasn't the first choice for the role, and I don't know how R. Lee Ermey will ever top his portrayal of Willard's sadistic boss; he puts his own ""Full Metal Jacket"" character to shame. In fact, Glover and Ermey perform so well together that it's only too easy to identify with Willard. Ermey pushes us, and Glover pulls us, into Willard's madness so adeptly that we don't even feel the snapping sensation when he finally loses his mind forever.Unfortunately, this version of ""Willard"" suffers from, oh, what's a nice way to describe it, unfortunate editorial choices. There were three test screenings; the film was recut after the first screening to get a PG-13 rating instead of an R, and recut again after the second screening to increase the pace. A lot of important material was lost in the editing - material that sheds light on characters' motivations and gives significant information about Willard's family history.There's even a cut scene that completely changes the impact of a particular incident (Scully) in the story. Without the deleted scene, it looks as if Willard is a much more callous guy than he really is. That doesn't even make sense at that point in the movie.Ironically, the test screenings got *lower* ratings after each edit. A film that would have thoroughly pleased an admittedly small audience was mutilated to become less appealing for everyone. The suspense of ""Willard"" is not in wondering what happens next, but how it will happen. Stepping up the pace only spoils the ride. Slower pacing would have yielded a more coherent product, and the R-rated material (mostly language and some gore) would fit better with the overall feeling of the movie.In light of that, the extras are what make the DVD really special. After you see the deleted/alternate scenes (including an alternate ending!), listen to the commentary track, and watch the ""making of"" documentary, you'll have a better picture of what this film could have been. There's also a neat documentary - narrated by Bruce Davison - about rats in general, and a hilarious music video of Crispin Glover's rendition of ""Ben."" There are even more goodies in the DVD-ROM section.Of course, if you just love to watch rats and/or Crispin Glover, ""Willard"" is pure bliss and nothing else matters!",4,Buy it for the extras!,1076284800,"02 9, 2004",2004,3167,"['.This', 'film', 'four-star', 'concept', 'five-star', 'performances', 'three-star', 'results', 'mostly', 'editing-related', 'problems', 'So', ""'re"", 'big', 'concept', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'looking', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'rather', 'are', 'movie', 'should', 'make', 'very', 'happy', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'love', 'Willard', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'having', 'fill', 'blanks', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'might', 'be', 'disappointed.The', 'basic', 'story', 'similar', 'original', 'version', 'Willard', 'very', 'different', 'take', 'character', 'situation', 'title', 'character', '1971', 'film', 'quite', 'relaxed', 'outgoing', 'optimistic', 'compared', 'nervous', 'Willard', '2003', 'spirit', 'was', 'crushed', 'long', 'ago', 'highs', 'are', 'higher', 'lows', 'are', 'lower.Actors', 'rats', 'alike', 'give', 'wonderful', 'wonderfully', 'directed', 'performances', 'Glover', 'such', 'natural', 'Willard', ""'m"", 'shocked', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'choice', 'role', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'R.', 'Lee', 'Ermey', 'will', 'ever', 'top', 'portrayal', 'Willard', 'sadistic', 'boss', 'own', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'character', 'shame', 'fact', 'Glover', 'Ermey', 'perform', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'only', 'too', 'easy', 'identify', 'Willard', 'Ermey', 'Glover', 'Willard', 'madness', 'so', 'adeptly', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'feel', 'snapping', 'sensation', 'when', 'finally', 'mind', 'forever.Unfortunately', 'version', 'Willard', 'suffers', 'oh', 'what', 'nice', 'way', 'describe', 'unfortunate', 'editorial', 'choices', 'were', 'three', 'test', 'screenings', 'film', 'was', 'recut', 'first', 'screening', 'get', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'instead', 'R', 'recut', 'again', 'second', 'screening', 'increase', 'pace', 'lot', 'important', 'material', 'was', 'lost', 'editing', 'material', 'light', 'characters', 'motivations', 'significant', 'information', 'Willard', 'family', 'history.There', 'even', 'cut', 'scene', 'completely', 'impact', 'particular', 'incident', 'Scully', 'story', 'deleted', 'scene', 'Willard', 'much', 'more', 'callous', 'guy', 'really', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'sense', 'point', 'movie.Ironically', 'test', 'screenings', 'got', '*lower*', 'ratings', 'edit', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'thoroughly', 'pleased', 'admittedly', 'small', 'audience', 'was', 'mutilated', 'become', 'less', 'appealing', 'everyone', 'suspense', 'Willard', 'not', 'wondering', 'what', 'next', 'how', 'will', 'happen', 'Stepping', 'up', 'pace', 'only', 'ride', 'Slower', 'pacing', 'would', 'have', 'yielded', 'more', 'coherent', 'product', 'R-rated', 'material', 'mostly', 'language', 'gore', 'would', 'fit', 'better', 'overall', 'feeling', 'movie.In', 'light', 'extras', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'DVD', 'really', 'special', 'see', 'deleted/alternate', 'scenes', 'including', 'alternate', 'ending', 'listen', 'commentary', 'track', 'watch', 'making', 'documentary', ""'ll"", 'have', 'better', 'picture', 'what', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'also', 'neat', 'documentary', 'narrated', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'rats', 'general', 'hilarious', 'music', 'video', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'rendition', 'Ben', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'goodies', 'DVD-ROM', 'section.Of', 'course', 'just', 'love', 'watch', 'rats', 'and/or', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'Willard', 'pure', 'bliss', 'nothing', 'else', 'matters']",N/A

Until he discovers a rat he names Socrates and his minions.  Willard loves Socrates but hates his second in command, which he named Ben.  Willard slowly loses his grasp on reality and becomes a psychopath ordering his &#34;friends&#34; to do his dirty work.  Glover's acting is worth seeing this alone.  It's a solid, sad tale.

He lives in a large house with his mother who constantly gets on his nerves.Willard, the boss, and Willard's mother are all overly caricatured characters because of their one dimensional and unrealistic personalities.  Willard's character seems like it was pulled straight out of a comic book.  He acts childish and seems to be out of touch with reality.  His boss has the audacity to insult him like a schoolyard bully in front of the other employees.  Anyone who would tolerate that type of work environment must be pretty desperate.  I found Willard's mother very irritating and annoying and got some sense that her character poked fun at older people.In the first Willard movie all of the rats were real, but this picture uses computer images in some scenes and looks obviously fake.

769489,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B0000AZT76,Jeffrey Leach,"[0, 1]","Now here's a subject I can really sink my teeth into: Crispin Glover. The name alone conjures up vivid mental images, most of them extremely unsettling. If you're like me, you first became aware of this actor when he co-starred in the highly successful ""Back to the Future"" franchise in the 1980s. He's since done a bunch of films--most of them flying in low on the radar screen--that usually showcase his unusual personality. ""Unusual"" is the operative word here because Glover is about as odd a duck as you can imagine, odd even for the general insanity that characterizes the maniacs running the Hollywood asylum. Crispin's penchant for spastic body language, shrieking vocal intonations, and bizarre facial expressions wouldn't seem to suit him for the number of major roles he has had in the past two decades. But what do I know? There might be millions of Crispin Glover fans out in the hinterlands literally frothing at the mouth in anticipation of his next picture. If this is the case, most of them should be quite happy with ""Willard,"" the 2003 remake of the 1971 cult classic starring Bruce Davidson. I haven't seen the original, but the new version is surprisingly worth a look for both fans and non-fans of Glover.Willard Stiles (Crispin Glover) has a life very few people would envy. His father passed away years before, leaving the family business in the hands Frank Martin (R. Lee Ermey), one of the worst bosses in the history of modern industry. As part of the arrangement of taking over the enterprise, Martin agreed to a clause in the contract stipulating that he must keep Willard on the payroll. This he does, but that doesn't mean he must treat Stiles with an ounce of respect. In fact, he constantly badgers the timid Willard, bullying and cajoling him over the slightest work related difficulties. Martin even locks Willard in the elevator one day after verbally haranguing him in front of the entire office. Sounds pretty terrible, right? Well, it gets worse. Young Willard lives in a rundown home with his ailing mother Henrietta (Jackie Burroughs), a woman who never misses an opportunity to run her son ragged. She's sort of the female equivalent of Fred Sanford in that she's been dying of the same ailment for decades. Henrietta is about as histrionic as Fred Sanford, too. Willard thus has no place, neither work nor home, in which he can seek solace. Even the beautiful Cathryn (Laura Herring), a new hire at work with a soft spot for Willard, provides little in the way of relief.Then Willard's mother passes away. Left adrift at home with no responsibilities for the first time in years, Stiles finally has time to explore his abode. It isn't too long before he discovers his destiny, namely befriending the huge number of mice living in the walls of his house. In the basement, Willard discovers a white mouse he quickly dubs Socrates, and the two become the best of friends. Socrates is an extremely intelligent creature, able to understand Willard's every desire as well as muster the services of the other little beasties. The only obstacle to the newfound friendship between mouse and man is Ben, a gigantic brown sewer rat that also pops in from time to time. When Willard decides to use his little army to seek a little flat tire revenge against Frank Martin, he utilizes the skills of Ben to great effect. But things turn sour afterwards. Socrates garners the lion's share of Willard's attentions, leaving Ben feeling left out in the cold. This falling out will soon attain disastrous dimensions. In the meantime, the work situation deteriorates to the point that Martin, finally feeling free of his obligations after the passing of Henrietta, fires Willard. Worse, Martin kills Socrates after the little guy escapes from Stiles's desk. All heck breaks lose when Willard marshals his little army against his evil former boss.""Willard"" is an enjoyable little film. Glover gives a surprisingly nuanced performance as the hapless Willard Stiles, and even goes so far as to restrain his usually manic personality (until his breakdown after Martin fires him, that is). R. Lee Ermey is, as usual, the perfect choice to play an over the top villain. His Frank Martin is downright frightening, and should be instantly recognizable to anyone who has ever had a tyrant for a boss. Glover and Ermey do such a good job that it took me awhile to realize that the movie underutilizes Laura Harring as the possible love interest. She actually drops out of sight for large stretches of time during the movie. Just as important as the human actors are the mice, particularly Socrates and Ben, but the movie loses a bit of luster with the obvious CGI effect of thousands of mice swarming around Willard. I also must express disappointment with the PG-13 rating; I looked forward to lots of bloody atrocities in this movie only to discover relatively few, and decidedly tame, mice attacks. Even the demise of Martin is a letdown. An extra on the disc discusses the reasons for a friendlier cut of the film, and also shows us a slightly gorier version of Frank's expiration in a deleted scene.Speaking of extras, the DVD for ""Willard"" contains plenty stuff. Trailers, deleted scenes, a commentary track, and an alternate ending are all here. So is a lengthy behind the scenes documentary, ""The Year of the Rat,"" which explains every aspect of the pre-production, production, and post-production process. ""Rat People: Friends or Foes?"" examines real life individuals who keep rats and mice as pets. Be sure and check out Crispin Glover's music video ""Ben"" before finishing the disc. It's a weird one, perfectly fitting Glover's persona. Give ""Willard"" a shot the next time you go to the video store. You might be pleasantly surprised.",4,Entertaining,1102723200,"12 11, 2004",2004,5756,"['Now', 'here', 'subject', 'can', 'really', 'sink', 'teeth', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'name', 'alone', 'up', 'vivid',

That said, I think this movie still pales on some levels when compared to its original with Bruce Davidson as the title character.  The picked on boy who befriends a white rat and eventually trains an army of rats to do his bidding seemed much more serious and less self aware in the original.  When Davidson confronted and poked / prodded Borgnine over the death of Socrates, that was chilling; as when Willard eventually met his demise with Ben looking on, a much more powerful ending than this version.

Lee Ermy) and has a sickly mother (Jackie Burroughs). He is a very lonely worker of a man until one day he saves a white rat as he starts to have an obsession with rats to train them what to do including one large rat nicknamed Ben which he dubbed. Now it seems that he is using them as a weapon for his anger and revenge against the people who like to push him as he is falling out of his mind.A truly excellent remake of 1971's cult classic is one of the best yet underrated remakes in recent memory of the horror genre. Glen Morgan (Final Destination) fame was at his peak when he did this re-envisioning of one of the most underrated movies. The casting was perfect including Crispin Glover taking over the role of Willard originally played by Bruce Davidson and i also like how they made a tribute to that movie with this one using references of Bruce Davidson in a painting as the dead father of the title troubled figure. This one deals with the madness of being lonely and the obsession of certain animals can lead to certain dangers that could drive you mad.This DVD offers both widescreen and fullscreen versions with audio commentary, alternate and deleted scenes with optional commentary, a documentary, featurette, music video by Crispin Glover singing Michael Jackson's famed ""BEN"" song with optional commentary, Trailer, TV Spots and DVD-Rom features.",5,Fantastic remake!,1269043200,"03 20, 2010",2010,1505,"['Willard', 'Stiles', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'son', 'wealthy', 'dead', 'factory', 'owner', 'now', 'ran', 'friend', 'family', 'named', 'Mr.', 'Martin', 'R.', 'Lee', 'Ermy', 'sickly', 'mother', 'Jackie', 'Burroughs', 'very', 'lonely', 'worker', 'man', 'one', 'day', 'white', 'rat', 'have', 'obsession', 'rats', 'train', 'what', 'do', 'including', 'one', 'large', 'rat', 'nicknamed', 'Ben', 'dubbed', 'Now', 'using', 'weapon', 'anger', 'revenge', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'push', 'falling', 'mind.A', 'truly', 'excellent', 'remake', '1971', 'cult', 'classic', 'one', 'best', 'yet', 'underrated', 'remakes', 'recent', 'memory', 'horror', 'genre', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'Final', 'Destination', 'fame', 'was', 'peak', 'when', 'did', 're-envisioning', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'movies', 'casting', 'was', 'perfect', 'including', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'taking', 'over', 'role', 'Willard', 'originally', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Davidson', 'i', 'also', 'how', 'made', 'tribute', 'movie', 'one', 'using', 'references', 'Bruce', 'Davidson', 'painting', 'dead', 'father', 'title', 'troubled', 'figure', 'one', 'madness', 'being', 'lonely', 'obsession', 'certain', 'animals', 'can', 'lead', 'certain', 'dangers', 'could', 'drive', 'mad.This', 'DVD', 'offers', 'widescreen', 'fullscreen', 'versions', 'audio', 'commentary', 'alternate', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'commentary', 'documentary', 'featurette', 'music', 'video', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'singing', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'famed', 'BEN', 'song', 'optional', 'commentary', 'Trailer', 'TV', 'Spots', 'DVD-Rom', 'features']",N/A

The rat effects are quite well done and the suspense is handled nicely.  Willard's descent into madness is believable.  The DVD contains an alternate ending (both are good).

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[0, 2]","It's a shame that such a wonderfully weird actor such as Crispin Glover has never achieved the success of many other, lesser actors in Hollywood.  He's flat out creepy and funny at the same time.  With that said, Glover is the shining star of ""Willard,"" a tale about a man gone mad, using rats to exact revenge on those who've spurned him.The story starts out promising enough, showing Glover taking care of the rat problem his mother says that they have.  He befriends one of the rodents, who he names Socrates.  This rat becomes his favorite and it draws jealous reaction from Big Ben, one of the biggest rats I've ever seen outside of a nutria.  Glover is constantly mistreated at work by the owner of the company his father started years ago.  R. Lee Ermey is wasted as the jerk boss in this flick.  His dialogue leaves him little to work with.  He's fun to watch, but I wish that he would have been given better lines.  As expected, he becomes the focus of Willard's ratty rage.Slowly, Willard loses what little sanity he has left, as well as control of the rats.  At first they do his bidding, but after awhile, they turn on him.  I won't say why or how, but they do.  Glover does a good job as he attempts to retain control of the rats, but things get a little too silly for my tastes.The movie drags along at a snail's pace.  The idea of a man running an army of rats seems pretty good at first, but Glover looks somewhat ridiculous scolding Ben and the rest of the rats in the feature.  Had he been scolding a pack of wolves or something to that effect, the picture might have been better.This movie had potential, but it wastes its superb cast on a plot that fumbles along with no real direction.  It's a good way to burn a little time on a rainy afternoon, but it's not scary enough to be considered a horror film, and too silly to even be considered a dark comedy.

769502,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000AZT76,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 7]","&quot;Willard&quot; is another one of those movies that disappeared quickly after being released that turns out to be a lot better than you would have thought when you check it out on DVD.  If anything this remake of &quot;Willard&quot; is too slick for its own good and there is a point where an army of computer generated rats cannot help but remind you that it is computer generated (as opposed to being the work of rat wranglers).  But is is a stylish effort which reaches its apex in the shot where a waterfall of rats empties out of an elevator to reveal Willard with Ben and few friends on his shoulders.  However, if there is a quintessential moment in this film it is when Willard is given the gift of a cat, which he tosses into his house where the poor feline discovers it is grossly unnumbered.  As the rats turn the tables on the cat, we hear Michael Jackson sing &quot;Ben.&quot;  You have to admit, there is a sense of fun and joy to the sequence rarely found in a horror film.The familiar story for those of us who remember Bruce Davidson in 1971 (his cameo is as photographs of Willard's late father) is that Willard (Crispin Glover) is stuck at a dead end job at the business founded by his father but now run by the cruel taskmaster Frank Martin (R. Lee Ermey), while at home he takes care of his infirmed mother (Jackie Burroughs).  Willard does not have a friend in the world before he finds one in Socrates, a white rat.  Then he discovers that the other rats in the basement are willing to listen to what he says.  Well, except for the largest of the bunch, named Ben, and all of the ingredients are in place for the death and mayhem.Writer-director Glen Morgan apparently wrote the script for &quot;Willard&quot; with actor Doug Hutchison (Percy Wetmore in &quot;The Green Mile&quot;) in mind for the title role.  This is rather ironic because the chief attraction of this film is the performance of Crispin Glover.  To every one who saw Glover in the first &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; film, the fact that he would be perfect as Willard Stilles seems fairly obvious.  Emery, as the film's villain, is not as scary as he was in the remake of &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,&quot; but still has its moments and it was certainly a trip to see Burroughs, remembered as Aunt Hetty from &quot;Tales of Avonlea,&quot; as Willard's mother, who decides that his problem is his name and re-christens him &quot;Clark.&quot;  Laura Elena Harring plays Cathryn, the temp worker hired to help Willard at work and who takes a liking to him despite his problems, but she is never more than an observer on the festivities.The DVD extras are fairly interesting given the problems Morgan had it putting a finished film together.  Starting with a R-rated version that gets below average ratings from the first preview audience, he cobbles together a pair of PG-13 versions, with a changed ending, but each version gets even lower scores and the film is sent off into the world to only make $4 million its first week, finish in eighth place, and disappear a fortnight later.  The back story on this remake is more interesting than most.

769503,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0000AZT76,Lawyeraau,"[21, 23]","It appears that Crispin Glover is carving a niche for himself on the silver screen, playing slightly creepy, social misfits (&quot;Back to the Future&quot;, &quot;Bartleby&quot;).  In this re-make of the 1971 film of the same name that starred Bruce Davidson, Crispin Glover plays the title role, that of Willard Stiles.Willard  is a lonely young man who lives in a huge mansion from days gone by with his decaying, elderly mother (Jackie Burroughs). He works in the industrial plant that used to belong to his father, before it was stolen out from under him by Mr. Martin (R. Lee Ermey), the man who is now Willard's boss. Cruelly tormented at work by Mr. Martin and beset at home by his overbearing mother whom he loves in an obsessive Norman Bates type of way, Willard is just plain weird.When he discovers that his home is plagued by rats, instead of exterminating them, he befriends one of them, a white rat whom he names Socrates, who is in command of the horde of rats that reside in the basement. His second in command is a huge brown rat whom Willard names Ben but whom he does not like. The horde of rats seem to live to do Willard's bidding. All that changes when the lovable Socrates meets a cruel and untimely end. That event totally unhinges both Willard and Ben, and therein lies the tale.Directed by X Files graduate Glen Morgan, with superlative production values,  the film has an inside joke that X File fans, such as myself,  will appreciate. Look for the orange cat, appropriately named Scully after red head Gillian Anderson, who plays the role of the same name in the X Files series. Moreover, links to the original &quot;Willard&quot; film, upon which this one is predicated, abound in the film. The portrait and family photographs of Willard's father look surprisingly like those of Bruce Davidson.It is as if the film were written tongue-in-cheek, as there is really nothing all that horrific about it, other than the demise of Socrates. In fact, as a true horror film, it fails. Even the rats are not scary. They end up being merely funny. This filmed failed at the box-office for this reason, because the powers that be marketed it as a horror genre film. As a portrait of the disintegration of a lonely, social misfit, however, the film fares better, due to the inspired casting of Crispin Glover. It is a film worth seeing, if only for Crispin Glover's performance.",3,HE'S BACK...,1076198400,"02 8, 2004",2004,2395,"['Crispin', 'Glover', 'carving', 'niche', 'silver', 'screen', 'playing', 'slightly', 'creepy', 'social', 'misfits', 'quot', 'Back', 'Future', 'quot', 'quot', 'Bartleby', 'quot', 're-make', '1971', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'starred', 'Bruce', 'Davidson', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'title', 'role', 'Willard', 'Stiles.Willard', 'lonely', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'huge', 'mansion', 'days', 'gone', 'decaying', 'elderly', 'mother', 'Jackie', 'Burroughs', 'industrial', 'plant', 'used', 'belong', 'father', 'was', 'stolen', 'out', 'Mr.', 'Martin', 'R.', 'Lee', 'Ermey', 'man', 'who', 'now', 'Willard', 'boss', 'Cruelly', 'tormented', 'work', 'Mr.', 'Martin', 'beset', 'home', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'whom', 'obsessive', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'type', 'way', 'Willard', 'just', 'plain', 'home', 'plagued', 'rats', 'instead', 'exterminating', 'one', 'white', 'rat', 'whom', 'names', 'Socrates', 'who', 'command', 'horde', 'rats', 'reside', 'basement', 'second', 'command', 'huge', 'brown', 'rat', 'whom', 'Willard', 'Ben', 'whom', 'not', 'like', 'horde', 'rats', 'seem', 'live', 'do', 'Willard', 'bidding', 'changes', 'when', 'lovable', 'Socrates', 'cruel', 'untimely', 'end', 'event', 'totally', 'Willard', 'Ben', 'therein', 'tale.Directed', 'X', 'Files', 'graduate', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'superlative', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'inside', 'joke', 'X', 'File', 'fans', 'such', 'will', 'appreciate', 'Look', 'orange', 'cat', 'appropriately', 'named', 'Scully', 'red', 'head', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'who', 'role', 'same', 'name', 'X', 'Files', 'series', 'Moreover', 'links', 'original', 'quot', 'Willard', 'quot', 'film', 'one', 'predicated', 'abound', 'film', 'portrait', 'family', 'photographs', 'Willard', 'father', 'look', 'surprisingly', 'Bruce', 'Davidson.It', 'film', 'were', 'written', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'really', 'nothing', 'horrific', 'other', 'demise', 'Socrates', 'fact', 'true', 'horror', 'film', 'Even', 'rats', 'are', 'not', 'scary', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'merely', 'funny', 'filmed', 'failed', 'box-office', 'reason', 'powers', 'be', 'marketed', 'horror', 'genre', 'film', 'portrait', 'disintegration', 'lonely', 'social', 'misfit', 'however', 'film', 'fares', 'better', 'due', 'inspired', 'casting', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'film', 'seeing', 'only', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'performance']",N/A

Crispin Glover is disturbing to watch as ""Willard"", a pathetic loner who slowly becomes mentally unhinged due to his miserable boss who tortures him. He bonds with a white rat named Socrates who leads a gang of rats in his basement. Willard and Socrates become best friends and Willard realizes that with Socrates' help that he can control the rats. The woman playing his mother was really scary and not very nice either. Glover is a terrific actor and his physical features make his character even more eerie. The pale skin and blue eyes. Lovely Laura Harring shows up as a work colleague who tries to befriend him and seems to be the only person to show kindness to Willard. Lee Ermey is wonderful as the mean as a skunk boss who tries to humiliate Willard at every turn, until he receives his come-uppance. I think this movie will strike a chord with anyone who ever felt alone and isolated. The black rat named Ben - this evil rat is frightening and is jealous of Socrates' bond with Willard.

769505,A2XVRCU5DQBULH,B0000AZT76,"L. Varnau ""nerff20""","[0, 1]","True, as of this writing it's only March, but that still doesn't stop the fact that of all the movies released so far in 2003, ""Willard"" is most definitely the best. Dark, gloomy, and very weird, this dark comedy centers around Willard (Crispin Glover), a young man with a crummy job, a nagging mother that still lives with him, and a rat problem in his basement. It's clear when the movie starts that Willard has been going crazy for quite some time.When we first meet him, it's a surefire bet he is no longer mentally secure. Soon, he has befriends the rats in his basement. He talks to them, feeds them, and gives them commands which they obey. He opens a bag and says ""in,"" and they scatter into the bag. He says ""out"" and they go out. Are the rats super-smart, or is Willard an expert on rats?He decides to use the rats to get payback for the years of yelling he has recieved from his boss. But things get strange when Willard makes friends with a girl at the office, who has a small crush on him. The rats are multiplying and taking over Willard's house. How much longer can he keep his secret, let alone control of the rats? Complicating this is super-rat Ben, who becomes the leader of the rats and, eventually, Willard's worst enemy.A misconception of this movie is that it is a horror film. It's far from it. This is a dark comedy not about super-intelligent rats, but about Willard, the insane man who controls them. Crispin Glover is excellent as Willard. He's dark, grim, yet occasionally funny. The film takes on the feel of a Tim Burton movie and it's a wonder he didn't make it himself. You could almost say this is the best Tim Burton film in years!This is an extremely well done film and is definitely going to be up there with the other great films yet to come out this year.

769507,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B0000AZT76,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[3, 4]","Crispin Glover is an incredibly versatile actor. His credits range from Michael J. Fox's father in the ""Back to the Future"" films to the Thin Man in both ""Charlie's Angels"" movies. He brings unique creativity to each of his rare film roles and is truly an underrated actor, almost always stuck in secondary roles, which he successfuly breathes life into. He graces us with a Norman Bates like quality in this remake of a 1971 horror cult classic, one of his few starring film roles.Willard, brilliantly overacted by Glover, is a wimp--a friendless mama's boy who is pushed around in every aspect of his life. His cadaverous mother, who echoes Norman Bates' mother in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" (until the film lets us in on the joke by letting us actually see her), bosses him around. Her emotional bullying is as fearsome as the physical intimidation that Willard faces at work, at the hands of Mr. Martin (R. Lee Ermey).The loud, foulmouthed Mr. Martin makes a point of reminding Willard, who always seems to be about 20 minutes late for work, that the only reason he has a job is because of a promise made to Willard's late father. Plain and simple, Willard's life is a huge mess.This all changes when his mother howls, ""Willard! There are rats in the basement!""Willard hates the idea of rats and having to deal with them, but doing his duty, he sets out traps. He catches a rat, only to find that he can't kill it. Willard frees the rat and names it Socrates. They cuddle and sleep together, as Socrates becomes an island for the previously friendless Willard. Socrates not only repays Willard with friendship, but serves as intermediary between Willard and the hundreds of rats living in the basement.But then there's Ben, a big ol' rat who brims with a shifty-eyed malevolence that is chilling. When Socrates meets an untimely demise, Willard, finally suffering one straw too many by Mr. Martin, goes over the edge.Glover dominates the screen. He does a magnificent, 80-minute slow burn in his marvelous performance, which engenders empathy and ultimately pity when he goes too far. Willard isn't legitimately evil, and with this shade of gray, we empathize.Rat-phobic people should be warned that these aren't cute rats. ""Willard"" employs a very effective mixture of real (550 of 'em) and animatronic rats. The mammoth, terrifying Ben is an African Gambian rat that is indeed the size of a cat, while Socrates is an albino Norwegian rat. There is some CGI touch-up of the rats' facial expressions, but Glover frolics among and cuddles up to the real thing. He does this with a zeal that makes what these critters represent for him - friendship and, ultimately, effective conflict resolution - absolutely believable.The film is like a dream--slow, dark, scary, and emotional. The premise is a bit far-fetched, which is putting off some people, but this is a well-done horror film. It manages to get under your skin with its creepy setting and recognizable characters. ""Willard"" is definitely one of the most atmospheric and intense horror films to come out in the past decade. It's wonderfully intense and extremely emotional, a creepy and suspenseful thriller that I recommend to any horror fan.

This remake of the 1971 thriller (starring a very young Bruce Davison) is funnier than it is scary.  Poor Willard lives in a big dark mansion with a mother who sounds like Norman Bates Mom (played wonderfully by veteran Jackie Burroughs).  Tormented by his mother, his lack of friends and, especially, his nasty boss (R. Lee Ermey), Willard slowly breaks down emotionally and befriends the rats in his cellar.  Socrates is his favorite, but Ben is jealous, bigger and much meaner.  You can guess what happens - it's that predictable.  However, the rat scenes are completely believable with `Animatronics' and most of the scenes are Glover with real rats.  The atmosphere is all there, the mean boss who is sure to get his as well as the main characters angst.  R. Lee Ermey is never believably mean enough as the boss, but his lines with Willard are classic camp.  The best part is watching Glover's facial contortions and temper tantrums.  He is already a train wreck waiting to derail all over again.  There is also a great scene with a cat that vainly tries to escape a never ending swarm of rats.

769510,ACZYPXGXGJ2K2,B0000AZT76,M. C. Myers,"[2, 3]","I have never seen the original Willard, and believed that this might be a serious handicap to my enjoyment of the 2003 edition. After all, no one would remake the '70s horror film about killer rats most infamous for the Jackson Five theme of its sequel, unless for purposes of kitsch. I was surely about to watch a movie filled with smug in-jokes and glib mockeries of '70s style. Then again, I thought, Crispin Glover is in it, and it looks like the filmmakers are going for that stylish post-modern noir that is all the rage, or at least would be if any of those films made money. But having seen the film, I now see that it encompasses both these elements, and yet is much, much more: Willard is a very enjoyable psychological suspense film, able to get under your skin not because of the creepy rodents, but because it presents, to an audience (at least in my case) lulled into vulnerability by their expecations, a far more disturbing portrait of the human psyche pushed to the edge.Crispin Glover plays this man-child on the verge of collapse, as perhaps no one else could. Mr. Glover must be getting old (how long ago was Back to the Future?), yet going to work in his father's ill-fitting suit, he looks as though he is in the throes of adolescence. In fact, Willard is still grapling with the issues of adolescence, making friends, dealing with women, escpaing the shadow of his dead father and the considerable pull of his invalid, overbearing mother (at least she's sorry that its her fault her son's life was a waste, and tells him this). Norman Bates comes to mind, and the comparisons to Psycho are unavoidable when thinking about Willard Styles.In thinking about Willard's friends, however, the movie that comes to mind is The Birds. Actually, there's probably less blood in this film than The Birds, a surprising show of restraint given the trend in modern movies. (Big) Ben, the biggest, baddest rat of them all, has his moments of violence, gnawing faces or (most disturbing in its defiance) a foot, but he's far more terrifying when he's just sitting staring back at the camera, and perhaps has his strongest presence when not on screen at all. Once Willard realizes just how strong-willed a rat can be, he sleeps with a wooden cane, to club Ben with when he tries to get in bed with him and Socrates (Willard's favorite rat). After thoroughly rat-proofing his room, Willard goes to sleep, and later awakens to the gnawed remains of his cane.Willard owes a lot to Hitchcock, and I'm so glad I didn't know that going in. If I'd known that was the intent, I don't think I'd have seen the film. If there is one thing the world does not need, its a remake of a '70s horror flick that takes itself too seriously. But having been lured into the theater with the promise of unassuming dark comedy, I was pleasantly surprised by the film's boldness in making a film of such gravitas. There is self-mockery and a definate kitsch factor to the film (did the rats really need to be fed a treat called &quot;Numm Nuts?&quot;), and the film does revel in style over substance at times (mainly the climax of the film, where the focus on style was appropriate and entertaining), but Hitchcock's influence is palpable. Crispin Glover himself has gone so far as to venture a comparison of his character and Hamlet: &quot;Hamlet is a character who never comes to a decision, who doesn't act until its too late. There is a father who died but remains a specter. There is the closeness with the mother. There is the contemplation of suicide: Willard's 'to be or not to be' scene.&quot; That sort of quote, had I encountered it before seeing the movie, may had assured I would never see it, which would have been a shame, for as grandiose as Glover's claims sound, he's right.",4,Better than a film about rats has any right to be,1078790400,"03 9, 2004",2004,3774,"['have', 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'Willard', 'believed', 'might', 'be', 'serious', 'handicap', 'enjoyment', '2003', 'edition', 'one', 'would', 'remake', ""'70s"", 'horror', 'film', 'killer', 'rats', 'most', 'infamous', 'Jackson', 'Five', 'theme', 'sequel', 'purposes', 'kitsch', 'was', 'surely', 'watch', 'movie', 'filled', 'smug', 'in-jokes', 'glib', 'mockeries', ""'70s"", 'style', 'Then', 'again', 'thought', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'going', 'stylish', 'post-modern', 'noir', 'rage', 'least', 'would', 'be', 'films', 'made', 'money', 'having', 'seen', 'film', 'now', 'see', 'elements', 'yet', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'Willard', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'psychological', 'suspense', 'film', 'able', 'get', 'skin', 'not', 'creepy', 'rodents', 'audience', 'least', 'case', 'lulled', 'vulnerability', 'expecations', 'far', 'more', 'disturbing', 'portrait', 'human', 'psyche', 'pushed', 'edge.Crispin', 'Glover', 'man-child', 'verge', 'collapse', 'perhaps', 'one', 'else', 'could', 'Mr.', 'Glover', 'must', 'be', 'getting', 'old', 'how', 'long', 'ago', 'was', 'Back', 'Future', 'yet', 'going', 'work', 'father', 'ill-fitting', 'suit', 'throes', 'adolescence', 'fact', 'Willard', 'still', 'grapling', 'issues', 'adolescence', 'making', 'friends', 'dealing', 'women', 'escpaing', 'shadow', 'dead', 'father', 'considerable', 'pull', 'invalid', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'least', 'sorry', 'fault', 'son', 'life', 'was', 'waste', 'Norman', 'mind', 'comparisons', 'Psycho', 'are', 'unavoidable', 'when', 'thinking', 'about', 'Willard', 'Styles.In', 'thinking', 'Willard', 'friends', 'however', 'movie', 'mind', 'Birds', 'Actually', 'probably', 'less', 'blood', 'film', 'Birds', 'surprising', 'show', 'restraint', 'given', 'trend', 'modern', 'movies', 'Big', 'Ben', 'biggest', 'baddest', 'rat', 'moments', 'violence', 'gnawing', 'most', 'disturbing', 'defiance', 'foot', 'far', 'more', 'terrifying', 'when', 'just', 'sitting', 'staring', 'back', 'camera', 'perhaps', 'strongest', 'presence', 'when', 'not', 'screen', 'Once', 'Willard', 'just', 'how', 'strong-willed', 'rat', 'can', 'be', 'wooden', 'cane', 'club', 'Ben', 'when', 'get', 'bed', 'Socrates', 'Willard', 'favorite', 'rat', 'thoroughly', 'rat-proofing', 'room', 'Willard', 'sleep', 'later', 'awakens', 'gnawed', 'cane.Willard', 'lot', 'Hitchcock', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'going', ""'d"", 'known', 'was', 'intent', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'world', 'not', 'need', 'remake', ""'70s"", 'horror', 'flick', 'too', 'seriously', 'having', 'been', 'lured', 'theater', 'promise', 'unassuming', 'dark', 'comedy', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'film', 'boldness', 'making', 'film', 'such', 'gravitas', 'self-mockery', 'definate', 'kitsch', 'factor', 'film', 'did', 'rats', 'really', 'need', 'be', 'fed', 'treat', 'called', 'quot', 'Numm', 'Nuts', 'quot', 'film', 'revel', 'style', 'substance', 'times', 'mainly', 'climax', 'film', 'where', 'focus', 'style', 'was', 'appropriate', 'entertaining', 'Hitchcock', 'influence', 'palpable', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'gone', 'so', 'far', 'venture', 'comparison', 'character', 'Hamlet', 'quot', 'Hamlet', 'character', 'who', 'never', 'decision', 'who', ""n't"", 'act', 'too', 'late', 'father', 'who', 'died', 'specter', 'closeness', 'mother', 'contemplation', 'suicide', 'Willard', ""'to"", 'be', 'not', 'be', 'scene.', 'quot', 'sort', 'quote', 'had', 'encountered', 'seeing', 'movie', 'may', 'had', 'assured', 'would', 'never', 'see', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'shame', 'as', 'grandiose', 'Glover', 'claims', 'sound', 'right']",N/A

They think, ""How can an actor in a horror or science fiction movie compare with a classical drama or action movie?""  There have been some tremendously wonderful performances from actors in films like WILLARD.  Crispin Glover's eerily deranged performance as the title character is brilliant.  If anyone can embody the warped psychology of Willard, Glover is the one to bring it to its most adequate fruition.  From the moment we meet Willard, we can tell he is a loner, a young man trapped in a world of silence, loneliness, self flagellation, and a mother he loves/hates.  Once he befriends Socrates and the other rats, he becomes more of a person, feeling comfortable with friends that appreciate and obey him.  Glover's demonic outbursts work mainly because we can feel and sense the rage he's holding in, and when it explodes, it's with a demon's wrath.  Glover shines in this role, and should have been considered for an Oscar.The rest of the cast is superflous, although R. Lee Ermey's turn as Frank Martin as Willard's heartless boss, is one of this usually deadpan actor's best.  Laura Harring is good as Cathryn, who wants to be Willard's friend; and Jackie Burroughs is frighteningly effective as Willard's possessive mother.As for the rats, what can I say?  I don't know why people come down so hard on CGI effects.  Modern technology has allowed films to give us the ""image"" of something horrible.  They looked real enough for me, and I would rather have had that than an inappropriate attempt to corral a thousand real rats.The inclusion of Michael Jackson's ""Ben"" while the rats mercilessly pursue and devour Scully the cat is both repulsive and brilliantly executed.WILLARD is much better than the original and deserved more praise than it got.",5,CRISPIN CRITTERS,1092096000,"08 10, 2004",2004,1869,"['always', 'baffled', 'when', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'are', 'made', 'horror', 'genre', 'sadly', 'overlooked', 'think', 'How', 'can', 'actor', 'horror', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'compare', 'classical', 'drama', 'action', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'tremendously', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'actors', 'films', 'WILLARD', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'eerily', 'deranged', 'performance', 'title', 'character', 'brilliant', 'anyone', 'can', 'embody', 'warped', 'psychology', 'Willard', 'Glover', 'one', 'bring', 'most', 'adequate', 'fruition', 'moment', 'meet', 'Willard', 'can', 'tell', 'loner', 'young', 'man', 'trapped', 'world', 'silence', 'loneliness', 'flagellation', 'mother', 'Once', 'Socrates', 'other', 'rats', 'more', 'person', 'feeling', 'comfortable', 'friends', 'appreciate', 'obey', 'Glover', 'demonic', 'outbursts', 'work', 'mainly', 'can', 'feel', 'sense', 'rage', 'holding', 'when', 'demon', 'wrath', 'Glover', 'role', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'Oscar.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'superflous', 'R.', 'Lee', 'Ermey', 'turn', 'Frank', 'Martin', 'Willard', 'heartless', 'boss', 'one', 'usually', 'actor', 'best', 'Laura', 'Harring', 'good', 'Cathryn', 'who', 'be', 'Willard', 'friend', 'Jackie', 'Burroughs', 'frighteningly', 'effective', 'Willard', 'possessive', 'mother.As', 'rats', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'people', 'come', 'down', 'so', 'hard', 'CGI', 'effects', 'Modern', 'technology', 'allowed', 'films', 'give', 'image', 'something', 'horrible', 'looked', 'real', 'enough', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'had', 'inappropriate', 'attempt', 'corral', 'thousand', 'real', 'rats.The', 'inclusion', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Ben', 'rats', 'mercilessly', 'pursue', 'devour', 'Scully', 'cat', 'repulsive', 'brilliantly', 'executed.WILLARD', 'much', 'better', 'original', 'deserved', 'more', 'praise', 'got']",N/A

Admittedly, it does lack the literary depth of the novel [original title: RATMAN'S NOTEBOOKS] on which it is based (so did the 1971 film).  But star Crispin Glover, as the titular character, delivers an outstanding performance, consistently chewing the scenery in scene after scene.  If any actor can convince an audience that it's possible for a societal pariah to develop a spiritual affinity with a colony of rats and then utilize the critters in intricately orchestrated acts of revenge, the intriguing and eccentric Mr. Glover can.  Indeed, Crispin Glover IS Willard; he was born to play this role.WILLARD is a horror story, but modern horror buffs weaned on the likes of FRIDAY THE 13TH-type flicks may have panned this movie due to the relative lack of crimson-colored accoutrements.  (Gore buffs take note: A really bloody scene was shot, but it was cut down for the theatrical release.  The DVD extras include the un-edited version.)  Instead of using vivid viscera, this film generates genuine goose bumps via the depiction of Willard's decent into madness, an intense psychological deterioration that is spurred on by the cruel, tactless characters that people Willard's life.  If nothing else, it'll make you think twice about harassing an inattentive store clerk or a marginally competent coworker.It may be short on gore, but WILLARD is not without its eye candy.  The scenes that contain hoards of rats--some real and some FX-generated--are quite realistic and visually fascinating.  And then there is the stunningly beautiful Laura Harring, a former Miss USA, who portrays Willard's only non-rodent ally.  Not only is Ms. Harring a delight to look at, but she is also an excellent actress who does a very affecting job at providing a sympathetic, though tacit, love interest for Glover's character.  (Also watch for the buxom Kimberly Patton, a.k.a. Kim McKamy, in a minor role as one of Willard's coworkers.  Ms. Patton is better known to porn fans as Ashlyn Gere.)The WILLARD DVD offers lots of extras: An optional feature commentary; deleted and extended scenes (including alternate endings); a documentary on real people who are obsessed with keeping rats as pets; a behind-the-scenes documentary on the making of WILLARD; a really cool music video featuring star Crispin Glover doing his cover of the Jackson 5 tune BEN; and more.All in all, definitely worth the price of admission.",4,Welcome to the Rat Race....,1065571200,"10 8, 2003",2003,2595,"['received', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'basically', 'tepid', 'response', 'audiences', 'theatrical', 'release', '2003', 'remake', '1971', 'WILLARD', 'actually', 'very', 'entertaining', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'Admittedly', 'lack', 'literary', 'depth', 'novel', '[', 'original', 'title', 'RATMAN', 'NOTEBOOKS', ']', 'based', 'so', 'did', '1971', 'film', 'star', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'titular', 'character', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'consistently', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'scene', 'scene', 'actor', 'can', 'convince', 'audience', 'possible', 'societal', 'pariah', 'develop', 'spiritual', 'affinity', 'colony', 'rats', 'then', 'utilize', 'critters', 'intricately', 'orchestrated', 'acts', 'revenge', 'intriguing', 'eccentric', 'Mr.', 'Glover', 'can', 'Indeed', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'IS', 'Willard', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'role.WILLARD', 'horror', 'story', 'modern', 'horror', 'buffs', 'weaned', 'likes', 'FRIDAY', 'THE', '13TH-type', 'flicks', 'may', 'have', 'panned', 'movie', 'due', 'relative', 'lack', 'crimson-colored', 'accoutrements', 'Gore', 'buffs', 'take', 'note', 'really', 'bloody', 'scene', 'was', 'shot', 'was', 'cut', 'down', 'theatrical', 'release', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'un-edited', 'version', 'Instead', 'using', 'vivid', 'viscera', 'film', 'genuine', 'goose', 'bumps', 'depiction', 'Willard', 'decent', 'madness', 'intense', 'psychological', 'deterioration', 'spurred', 'cruel', 'tactless', 'characters', 'people', 'Willard', 'life', 'nothing', 'else', ""'ll"", 'make', 'think', 'twice', 'about', 'harassing', 'inattentive', 'store', 'clerk', 'marginally', 'competent', 'coworker.It', 'may', 'be', 'short', 'gore', 'WILLARD', 'not', 'eye', 'candy', 'scenes', 'contain', 'hoards', 'rats', 'real', 'FX-generated', 'are', 'quite', 'realistic', 'visually', 'fascinating', 'then', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'Laura', 'Harring', 'former', 'Miss', 'USA', 'who', 'Willard', 'only', 'non-rodent', 'ally', 'Not', 'only', 'Ms.', 'Harring', 'delight', 'look', 'also', 'excellent', 'actress', 'who', 'very', 'affecting', 'job', 'providing', 'sympathetic', 'tacit', 'love', 'interest', 'Glover', 'character', 'Also', 'watch', 'buxom', 'Kimberly', 'Patton', 'a.k.a', 'Kim', 'McKamy', 'minor', 'role', 'one', 'Willard', 'coworkers', 'Ms.', 'Patton', 'better', 'known', 'porn', 'fans', 'Ashlyn', 'Gere', 'WILLARD', 'DVD', 'lots', 'extras', 'optional', 'feature', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'including', 'alternate', 'endings', 'documentary', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'obsessed', 'keeping', 'rats', 'pets', 'behind-the-scenes', 'documentary', 'making', 'WILLARD', 'really', 'cool', 'music', 'video', 'featuring', 'star', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'doing', 'cover', 'Jackson', '5', 'tune', 'BEN', 'more.All', 'definitely', 'price', 'admission']",N/A

These two performances are why I still hold the original a little higher than the remake. The rats and effects are better(in most cases)in the new film,but they lost something along the way? F.Y.I.

A remake/sequel to the film of the same name released in the 70's (and notice the painting and pictures of the original film's star Bruce Davison), the film focuses around Willard (played exquisitely by Crispin Glover) who discovers he has a unique bond with the rats that have infested his basement.  He befriends a nice, small white rat who he names Socrates, and a big, bad rat named Ben.  Both of whom, along with the hundreds of other rats, can do whatever he tells them to do.  This proves useful since Willard's abusive boss (the always great R.Lee Ermey).  Director/screenwriter and X-Files alumnus Glen Morgan manages to give the film a great stylish look and a nice creepy atmosphere which blends with the surprisingly macabre humor that is abound.  Laura Harring (most notable for Mulholland Drive) is here pretty much as just eye candy, and her performance is mostly forgettable.  I for one am surprised at the film getting a PG-13 rating with the amount of blood abound, and unlike some of the other PG-13 rated horror movies of late (The Ring, Darkness Falls), Willard manages to be pretty memorable.

He has no friends.  His boss is evil in a brutal campy way.  He is timid to an extreme.  His mother burdens him with the task of removing the rats from the basement.  When he finds that one of the traps has worked, he finds himself compassionate for the victim, who he befriends.  Thus begins his minding of the rat colony in his basement.  The opportunities for horror here are tremendous.  Rats are generally considered creepy when encountered in the house.  Visuals of swarming rats should have provoked a sense of revulsion here but fails.  Director Glen Morgan pulls in the reigns every time this films threatens to run away with sanity.  Crispin Glover is allowed to explore Willard but comes off only as creepy when he should be disturbingly offensive to anyone with a tangible grip on reality.Willard is finally driven over the edge when his boss (R. Lee Ermey) steps on him for the last time.  However, like elsewhere in the film, he goes over the edge only to be caught one foot into the fall.  He's clearly crazy, but not really in a threatening way.  The one moment where he is truly frightening is when he is relishing with child-like mirth the vandalizing of his boss's car.The film is well shot.  The acting is competent throughout.  It simply doesn't go far enough.  The film had potential to go somewhere totally strange but didn't have the courage to do it.

The film is slow-paced and is SUPPOSED to be a horror but the only scary thing is the weird dialogue.

I would say he was a great actor but he acts this strange in everything so I can't say any talent was truly involved. Let's be real, would they have gotten Crispin if it weren't for his natural ability to scare the heck out of everyone who sees him? Emery was good as Willard's boss and I wish he could have stuck around. The lead woman was unnoticable and a little romance could have been thrown in to excite the audience a little bit.

769529,A35MX4QYGZ25FN,B0000AZT76,"Ren Hek ""Animator""","[1, 3]","Willard is a very unreckognized and unappreciated film. Only a few people like myself really understand the masterpeice of this film.  If you are one of those people, you rule!  However most people don't even give this movie a chance, they treat it as any other crummy rat movie.  Willard is far more then a rat movie, Willard isn't really a horror movie, it is a PSYCOLOGICAL THRILLER. Since this is a psycological thriller i can understand how so many idiots can hate it, beacause it is beyond their intelligece to understand Willard and get into his head. The only element that creates horror are the rats and if you ask me, you have to be a real panzi to be afraid of those rats.  Crispin Glover is AMAZING as Willard Stiles! Not to mention the great music.Willard is stuck in a job given to him by his dead father who committed suicide. This is probably the ground-stone to Willard's problem. Willard is afraid. Willard is afraid to lose his job, get any friends, win anyone's effection, or to be alone. He is afraid of being alone yet, afraid to become emotionally involved with anyone, and his greatest fear of all is that his mother will someday leave him......And when this happens, everything happens. Willard loses his house,his only friend, a rat named Socrates, to his employer whom has always given Willard H*** everyday of his life, and even more worse, Willard is FIRED! What can he do? Willard has lost everyone he ever loved, his job-which he has had his entire life, always hated and never got ahead, and he is afraid of change, he is afraid to go off on his own and get a job and apartment because all Willard has ever know from the world is shun from others. So what can he do? What can THEY do? Kill his boss thats it!Willard is now crazy and a murderer, but things are not any better, it gets worse and worse. The leader of the rats, Ben, is turning against him and neither man nor rat is his companion. Willard is alone, he is always alone and has always been alone.This is a remake of the original Willard, and as good as the original is, this film surpasses it. The original was a horror movie basis, but the remake is so much more.  Even the rats are better, I've heard from other reviewers on this site that Ben looked like a kangaroo rat freak (this animal is called a Gambian pounched rat)and the new ben is way better then the old one. The old movie neglected to show any emotion in the rats. Ben looks like a serial killer by himself when he sits on Willards bed staring him in the eyes, the old ben was some brown rat that looked like all the other rats, and showed next to no personality, I mean, as Willard was talking to him he would be looking in the opposite direction, bobbing his head around! However I'm not sure if i like the ending of the new Willard as much as the ending in the old one. Don't get me wrong, the original Willard was a great horror classic, but the new Willard goes much further then that.This DvD is also very good, it gives you wide and full screen versions, extra featurettes and commentary, and a funny music video done by Crispin Glover, oh and the menu has a rat crawl accross it if you leave the screen alone, lol.  Oh and if you are one of those movie lovers with too much time on your hands, like me, you might be interested to know that that big painting of Willard's father is Bruce Davison(Senator Kelly from X-Men)who played the original Willard Stiles in the original Willard!I think Willard would have done better if the director kept it as an R movie then 14A(in Canada, as a matter of fact, this movie was filmed in good old Canada) because I cant vision many young people understanding this complex film, I think the director was good, but need to stay with his 1st instict and not let the company people tell him what to do.  However the DvD has the origal scenes in it anyway, so you can kinda think of what you think would make the movie the best.In conclusion, Willard is a very unappreciated film, it gets better and better the more you watch it, and its not your normal rat movie, (rats rule) so I encourage anyone who isn't a little whiner, to see this movie and really think as you watch it.

769530,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0000AZT76,RMurray847,"[1, 1]","My wife and I watched this movie a few days ago, hoping it might end up being suitable viewing for our 11 year old daughter who loves creepy movies.  Except for one scene where the villian is surfing the web looking at porn sites and one ""f"" word...the movie meets the standard.  But not close enough.Anyway, you probably don't care about that.  WILLARD is really good, clean fun.  The story is not exactly the most action-packed, plot-heavy you'll find.  In many ways, we've got a 45 minute movie stretch to twice that length...but that's actually OK. We get to really know the character of Willard (brilliantly played by Crispin Glover) quite well, and grow gradually in our sympathy for him.And we get to know the character of the two lead rats!  Yep, that's right, rats.  If you don't know, Willard is a SUPER-shy, socially backward nerd who lives with his mom, and works in his dad's company for a horrible, mean, nasty, insulting boss.  When Willard's bedridden, crazy mom tells him there are rats in the basement, Willard sets out to kill them and ends up befriending them, particularly one lovely white rat he names Socrates, who becomes Willard's ""only friend.""  Willard and Socrates begin to organize the rats, and not only do we see Willard's gentle side coming out, we begin to see his dark, vengeful side.  But it's Ben, the big, ugly, mean, gray rat who begins to run the rat-colony more on his own terms, and is a direct competitor with Socrates.The politics of the rats, Willard's relationship with the rats and his slow emerging from his shell make up the majority of the movie.  Yes, eventually we get to see the rats wrecking a little havoc, but honestly, this is a pretty tame movie.  Only two people die (and one VERY unfortunate cat named Scully, in one of the movie's best scenes).  And it is paced in a leisurely manner.But it is never boring.  Glen Morgan and James Wong brought this remake to life (the team behind the original FINAL DESTINATION, and many, many great early episodes of the X-Files).  The sets are stylishly grubby, the lighting is theatrical and effective and best of all, the rats mostly look real.  I know they are often computer generated, but except for one scene when they pour out of an elevator, they are quite convincing.  And there are lots of real rats too, and the actors and the rats work well together (I can't believe I'm saying this!).  The young rat playing Socrates has a great future!!!And Crispin Glover...it's so good to see him again.  Ironically, just three weeks ago, I watched BACK TO THE FUTURE again.  He is just such a delightfully goofy screen presence.  Intense and not quite of this world.  And aside from his frightening performance in THE RIVER'S EDGE, we really haven't seen much of him.  I understand he's VERY tough to work with, but I'm glad he got this role.  To be honest, I cannot think of one single other performer who could have played the role like this.  Any other actor would have put a bit of ""nudge, nudge, wink, wink"" into the performance, letting us know they know it's over the top.  Glover is totally involved in his performance, and there is one scene where he is in a funeral parlor and just GOES OFF on an attorney visiting him.  The moment packs a huge emotional wallop.  In one way, it's hugely overacted...but in another, Glover has earned the right to explode and we feel like cheering.  It's a triumphant performance...I won't say Oscar-worthy, because that's not really the point.  It is a unique performance that must be seen to be believed.  It's not a major work (just as the movie is not a major work), but Glover has imbued it with a seriousness only someone who doesn't fully comprehend he's in a piece of fluff can do.Also, on the DVD are some really cool extras.  The deleted scenes are actually fun to watch, the music video is hilarious (especially with Glover's commentary) and the two documentaries are quite worthwhile.So, why only 4 stars if I love it so much?  Well, despite my glowing praise, as I said, this is a pretty slight movie.  It never really scares...it's entertaining but not thrilling.  And the ending is not so hot.  It feels a little tagged on, and, to be honest, kinda like the end of several early X-Files episodes!  This was okay for the X-files (where you got to see more the next week) but is a bit of a let-down for the movie.But, SEE IT!  I really appreciated the fine effort everyone put into this film.

769532,A2MJKH6DQIKTM3,B0000AZT76,Robert Amsel,"[2, 2]","I won't cover territory here that others have covered.  It's sad that this movie failed at the box office, to some extent due to censoring material down from an ""R"" rating to ""PG 13"" and thus aiming it toward younger teens, who hated it in initial screenings anyway, which should have given New Line and the director/producer a hint.  After all, the movie has its own brand of black humor that many younger teens are not going to enjoy or appreciate.  (However, the toning down of R. Lee Ermey's expletives, for whatever reason, was a positive thing, since four-letter words don't have much bite when overused.  But the toning down of the rats' violence was a big boo-boo.)Visually the movie is beautifully realized.  The acting, especially by Crispin Glover and Jackie Burroughs (you might remember her from ""More Tales/Further Tales of the City"") is exceptional, although Glover's interpretation might have been a bit off if this movie was going to work.Those who remember fondly the original with Bruce Davison and Elsa Lanchester should enjoy this version, which now benefits from modern computer-generated effects, in addition to 450 actual rats, plus rat puppets.  (As an homage to Davison, pictures of him as Willard's late father are scattered about Willard's house.)  The sets are also truly superlative in creating mood, as is the music score.Although Glen Morgan, the writer-director, based the script on the original screenplay, one problem is that Davison as Willard was always sympathetic, whereas Glover's Willard is too neurotic (verging on psychotic) from the beginning and loses audience sympathy at a certain point -- a fatal flaw.  This is far more Morgan's fault as director than Glover's.  R. Lee Ermey as Willard's nasty boss was also a wee bit over the top, and once again, Morgan must take the blame for not reeling him in a bit.  Strong actors should not dictate a movie's vision; that's the director's job, isn't it?Another problem is that Morgan steals from strong directors, mainly Hitchcock, that he admires.  That would be all right, except that Morgan is not skilled enough to realize that the seams should never show.  The movie-literate audience shouldn't be painfully aware that the director is plagiarizing.  The borrowings from ""Psycho"" are so obvious, from Willard's peculiar relationship to his mother to the film's ending, in which one could easily substitute Anthony Perkins (were he young and alive) with little difference. Also, the use of Michael Jackson's version of ""Ben"" couldn't help but call attention to itself in a scene in which the rats are terrorizing a helpless cat.  As an homage to the original ""Willard's"" sequel, it could have been used in the end titles only, rather than the Glover version that is used in the titles.  Let's face it, Michael, whatever his personal problems, is a much superior singer.One small quibble (as seen repeatedly in the documentary on the film) is this -- if Morgan is going to tackle screenplays, he should learn the proper use of pronouns.  He's one of these ""between he and I"" guys, which seems to be a common California thing. I hope Mr. Morgan buys himself a grammar book.Finally, there is a huge risk in remaking movies from yesteryear, and seldom are they successful.  The reason is that movies reflect the times in which they were made.  The U.S. audience of 30-plus years ago is totally different from today's audience.  Any producer willing to take such a risk had better explore very deeply why a movie was popular with audiences and what were the social, political, and economic trends of the time. Popular movies from the late 1960s and early 1970s often dealt with challenges to authority figures, as did the original ""Willard.""  But this challenge was happening in the real world too, with the anti-Vietnam War protests, the sexual revolution, etc.  Today's mainly conformist, conservative audiences just aren't going to relate!",3,Much better than theatrical release indicated,1071619200,"12 17, 2003",2003,3930,"['wo', ""n't"", 'cover', 'territory', 'here', 'others', 'have', 'covered', 'sad', 'movie', 'failed', 'box', 'office', 'extent', 'due', 'censoring', 'material', 'down', 'R', 'rating', 'PG', '13', 'thus', 'aiming', 'younger', 'teens', 'who', 'hated', 'initial', 'screenings', 'anyway', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'New', 'Line', 'director/producer', 'hint', 'movie', 'own', 'brand', 'black', 'humor', 'many', 'younger', 'teens', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'enjoy', 'appreciate', 'However', 'toning', 'R.', 'Lee', 'Ermey', 'expletives', 'reason', 'was', 'positive', 'thing', 'four-letter', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'bite', 'when', 'overused', 'toning', 'rats', 'violence', 'was', 'big', 'boo-boo', 'Visually', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'realized', 'acting', 'especially', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'Jackie', 'Burroughs', 'might', 'remember', 'More', 'Tales/Further', 'Tales', 'City', 'exceptional', 'Glover', 'interpretation', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'work.Those', 'who', 'remember', 'fondly', 'original', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'Elsa', 'Lanchester', 'should', 'enjoy', 'version', 'now', 'benefits', 'modern', 'computer-generated', 'effects', 'addition', '450', 'actual', 'rats', 'rat', 'puppets', 'homage', 'Davison', 'pictures', 'Willard', 'late', 'father', 'are', 'scattered', 'Willard', 'house', 'sets', 'are', 'also', 'truly', 'superlative', 'creating', 'mood', 'music', 'score.Although', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'writer-director', 'based', 'script', 'original', 'screenplay', 'one', 'problem', 'Davison', 'Willard', 'was', 'always', 'sympathetic', 'whereas', 'Glover', 'Willard', 'too', 'neurotic', 'verging', 'psychotic', 'beginning', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'certain', 'point', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'far', 'more', 'Morgan', 'fault', 'director', 'Glover', 'R.', 'Lee', 'Ermey', 'Willard', 'nasty', 'boss', 'was', 'also', 'wee', 'bit', 'top', 'once', 'again', 'Morgan', 'must', 'take', 'blame', 'not', 'reeling', 'bit', 'Strong', 'actors', 'should', 'not', 'dictate', 'movie', 'vision', 'director', 'job', ""n't"", 'problem', 'Morgan', 'steals', 'strong', 'directors', 'mainly', 'Hitchcock', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'Morgan', 'not', 'skilled', 'enough', 'realize', 'seams', 'should', 'never', 'show', 'movie-literate', 'audience', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'painfully', 'aware', 'director', 'plagiarizing', 'borrowings', 'Psycho', 'are', 'so', 'obvious', 'Willard', 'peculiar', 'relationship', 'mother', 'film', 'ending', 'one', 'could', 'easily', 'substitute', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'were', 'young', 'alive', 'little', 'difference', 'Also', 'use', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'version', 'Ben', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'call', 'attention', 'scene', 'rats', 'are', 'terrorizing', 'helpless', 'cat', 'homage', 'original', 'Willard', 'sequel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'end', 'only', 'rather', 'Glover', 'version', 'used', 'titles', 'Let', 'face', 'Michael', 'personal', 'problems', 'much', 'superior', 'singer.One', 'small', 'quibble', 'seen', 'repeatedly', 'documentary', 'film', 'Morgan', 'going', 'tackle', 'screenplays', 'should', 'learn', 'proper', 'use', 'pronouns', 'one', 'guys', 'be', 'common', 'California', 'thing', 'hope', 'Mr.', 'Morgan', 'grammar', 'book.Finally', 'huge', 'risk', 'remaking', 'movies', 'yesteryear', 'seldom', 'are', 'successful', 'reason', 'movies', 'reflect', 'times', 'were', 'made', 'U.S.', 'audience', '30-plus', 'years', 'ago', 'totally', 'different', 'today', 'audience', 'producer', 'willing', 'take', 'risk', 'had', 'better', 'explore', 'very', 'deeply', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'popular', 'audiences', 'were', 'social', 'political', 'economic', 'trends', 'time', 'Popular', 'movies', 'late', '1960s', 'early', '1970s', 'often', 'dealt', 'challenges', 'authority', 'figures', 'did', 'original', 'Willard', 'challenge', 'was', 'happening', 'real', 'world', 'too', 'anti-Vietnam', 'War', 'protests', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'etc', 'Today', 'mainly', 'conformist', 'conservative', 'audiences', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'relate']",N/A
769533,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0000AZT76,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Willard (Glen Morgan, 2003)You can't hear the name ""Glen Morgan"" without thinking ""and James Wong."" The two writers, whose collaborative career stretches all the way back through 21 Jump Street, first came to major prominence by being the bigwigs behind most of the scripts for The X-Files, then also branched off into the short-lived and wonderful Millennium. When millennium died and The X-Files was on its way out, Morgan and Wong did what any two cutthroat Hollywood insiders would do: jumped to the big screen. Their first joint venture was the amusing Final Destination, written by both of them and directed by Wong; this time around, Morgan took the helm, and we got a remake of one of 1971's finest movies, Willard. Odd, both 1971 and 2003 were banner years for horror flicks, and Willard was at the center of both.The X-Filing of Willard did exactly what you'd expect it to, if you've seen more than two episodes of The X-Files. The look and feel of the film is murky, dark, filled with odd, ornate details that never quite seem right, but never quite seem out of place, either. As with Final Destination, the stuff that was pushing the envelope in a TV series barely rates them a PG-13 here, but it's just as creepily effective, if not more so, for the lack of explicit detail. All in all, what they came up with is a gem, an excellent piece of filmmaking that equals, and in some cases outpaces, the wonderful original.This time, the role of Willard is played by Crispin Glover, the best of the young typecast-as-psychotic actors, and his annoying boss is played by R. Lee Ermey, in a rare civilian role. (You do still get some drill sergeant barking, however, so Ermey fans will not be disappointed.) Wilard, for those of you who have been living in a cave for thirty years, is a shy young man who discovers he has not only an attraction to, but an empathy with, rats. He befriends a rat he finds in the basement and names him Socrates. Socrates is the intelligent, wily leader of the pack, always at odds with Ben, the strong, charismatic co-leader. Willard and Ben immediately get locked into a battle of wills for control of the pack, each willing to manipulate the other to get what he wants.Yes, it sounds odd talking about a battle of wills between a human and a rat. But that's what's going on here, and it's filmed well enough that it should be obvious. Things get complicated when Willard's co-worker Cathryn (Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts' love interest in Mulholland Dr.) starts putting out relationship feelers. Pretty soon, everything's set up for a big disaster, but whom will it befall?The atmosphere of the film is wonderful, the acting is excellent, and the cinematography is as good as one would expect from Robert McLachlan, the usual cinematographer for the Morgan and Wong camp. Also, special note should be taken of the music of composer Shirley Walker, whose contribution to the film, while resembling Danny Elfman a bit too much at times, is some of her best work in years.Highly recommended.

This is one of those cases.The original ""Willard"" was clever and frightening in an intellectual sort of way, but the cheest special effects with the rats provided many unintentional laughs, something you do not want when you're watching a horror movie.  Now, with CGI and other special effects advancements, the cheesiness has been eradicated, leaving you to enjoy a very good storyline.Crispin Glover makes one hell of a Willard.  Given his off-the-wall personality off-screen, it seems as if he was made for this role.  His natural quirkiness plays a hand in making the audience really believe in the character.  The character is both disturbing and sympathetic because of this, a nice blend.Also, fans of the original ""Willard"" and its sequel ""Ben"", take note.  There's a funny nod to those films here.

769535,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0000AZT76,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","The remake of ""Willard"" proves that, in the world of movies, one decade's cause celebre can be another's box office nonentity.  The 1971 ""Willard"" had the kind of ingenious plotting that had everybody going to see it and talking about it.  In 2003, however, the new ""Willard,"" with the exact same plot, took in a mere $7 million in domestic receipts and made nary a ripple in the social fabric.  I guess that nowadays it takes a lot more than a screen full of swarming rats to draw people into the movie houses.Actually, despite the fact that the story lacks the shocking novelty it possessed three decades earlier, this new ""Willard"" is still a relatively effective chiller - slimy, creepy and extremely well acted.  Willard is a social misfit who discovers that he can communicate telepathically with the rats living in the basement of the old rundown house where he lives with his demanding, life-draining invalid mother.  Eventually, Willard creates his own army of rats to wreak vengeance on the boss who so callously mistreats and belittles him.  But Willard also discovers that insubordination is as much a factor in the animal kingdom as it is among humans and he soon finds himself in mortal combat with the king-sized leader of the pack whom Willard has christened ""Ben.""Of all actors currently working today, Crispin Glover is the perfect choice to play Willard.  Strange-looking enough already, Glover minimizes the kind of rug-chewing histrionics actors generally use when playing mentally disturbed characters, and, instead, brings a touch of humanity and pathos to the role.  R. Lee Ermery is cringingly effective as Willard's boss, turning this abusive foil into a truly hissable villain.  Director Glen Morgan lights the scenes very darkly, creating a world that is stark, antiseptic and faintly twisted.  Thanks to computer-generated special effects, this new ""Willard"" can have far more rats occupying the screen at one time than could the original, though such innovation comes with a price since there are times when the shots suffer from that CGI phoniness that afflicts so many films nowadays.  Still, the film gets the job done by making the skin crawl effectively from time to time.The film features a few fun ""in"" jokes, including using Bruce Davison, the original Willard, as this Willard's deceased father (Davison appears only in photographs), and playing Michael Jackson's ""Ben"" (the title song from the original ""Willard"" sequel) on the soundtrack in a scene in which hordes of ravenous rats devour a terrified and hapless cat.

I saw the dvd on Amazon for under $5 and I enjoy Crispin Glover's acting so I took a chance. I'm glad I bought the dvd. I don't know if it's because I had low expectations but I found the movie very enjoyable.The dvd is dual-sided.  One side presents the film in 2:40 Anamorphic widescreen. The other side gives us a 1:33 pan & scan version of the film. Overall the dvd looks great.  A very solid transfer.The dvd has some great extras.  First, there is an enjoyable commentary with Glen Morgan, James Wong, and Crispin Glover.  There is an exhaustive 73 minute documentary which covers pretty much every aspect of the production. I enjoyed the rat training segment.  My favorite extra is 18 minute ""Rat People"" documentary.  There are some very intersting people in the documentary.  Another ""interesting"" extra is the music video of Ben featuring Crispin Glover. Finally, there are a bunch of deleted scenes and an alternate ending.A R-rated version of the movie was originally filmed but the studio insisted on cutting it to get a PG-13 rating. Instead of the 1:33 version of the film, it would have been nice to have the original unrated version of the movie on the flip side.

There is even more to be said about a film that has Crispin Glover as its lead.  Glover plays Willard, a quiet, unassuming man who has become used to being trampled under the world's bootheel.  He lives with his ailing mother in a house much too large for such unhappy people, he works for the man who stole his father's business.  A business that still bears his family's name.  Willard can talk to rats.  I'm sure many people have done so throughout time, either with a yell of indignation at a rodent invading their home or with a murophobic scream while standing on a chair.  However, I doubt any of those people ever had the rats obey.The only other horror film performance I've seen this year of similar caliber was that of Sid Haig in Rob Zombie's House of 1,000 Corpses.  The level of sincerity in every frame with Crispin Glover is astonishing, his morose demeanor is disturbing, the gaunt appearance brings to mind a living Edward Gorey sketch.  You will never see a better transition from sorrow to rage in a film.  Unless you go back to some of Jack Nicholson's earlier work (ie. The Shining).It's not all Crispin Glover mind you, R. Lee Ermey plays Willard's boss to a despicable T, and the cast of rats are impressive.  Ben and Socrates are perfect in their roles ( which of course is due to great animal handling and some nice camerawork).  Overall this film comes across quite nicely, with some genuine creepiness and nice photography.  However, it seems that Crispin Glover could probably read the ingredients of a soup can and do an impressive job.

Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange""","[3, 4]","There's no doubt that the trailers for WILLARD caused many to squirm and wiggle in their seats as scenes of thousands of rats taking revenge are projected on the screen. Those who possess a clear dislike or fear of rats will be well-advised to sit this movie out. WILLARD is not a movie for general audiences, but fortunetly, the sight of rats fails to evoke such strong feelings. I was able to sit back and enjoy this clever remake of the 1971 cult classic horror movie.Crispin Glover brilliantly plays a socially awkward man named Willard who befriends the rats who occupy his basement. Willard names the first rat he encounters Socrates and positions him/her to be the leader of the rats. Soon Willard has the power to direct the actions of the rats to his will, often at the direct cost of others. Revenge is acted upon those who have harmed him, in particular his horrible boss who deserves everything that is coming to him. But Willard doesn't command all the power over the army of rats. A giant rat named Ben ultimately has the last word.In addition to the wonderful acting, the cinematography and set designs are clever. Both successfully lend to the atmosphere and drama of this film. The house that Willard occupies with his old and ailing mother and the office in which he works appears virtually frozen in time. There is almost a timeless appeal between the interactions of Willard and his surroundings that complement the film.

769539,A1E3BUSVZKA1K6,B0000AZT76,Scott Davies,"[7, 7]","As soon as I saw the trailer for Willard I got chills of excitement. Seeing Crispin Glover taking on this role was genius as it seemed to be the perfect vessel for his eccentric talent, though I also knew the film would not draw a large audience. The best ones never do. I was surprised to hear Glover was far from the first choice. It seems like a natural selection.Having grown up in the 70's seeing the original film on late night TV, the primary selling point to me for this remake was Glover. I never found the rat-lover story exceptionally intriguing but with this casting it put such an excitement in me. I couldn't wait.The weekend Willard opened shortly followed a personal trauma that left me in a lingering black mood and I hoped this film would remind me that I wasn't completely alone in the world, that there are others that enjoy and create the same things that appeal to me. I walked in the theater that afternoon to the absolute perfect setting. I was the only one there. I anxiously sat waiting for the film to start, hoping no one else would come in to bother me. The lights dimmed and the movie started with me the sole viewer. From the second the music started and the credits rolled I got a chill that remained for the duration of the film. What an amazing experience this was. Glover was, as anticipated, absolutely brilliant. The bits of wicked humor just added to my assumption that this film will not appeal to the average dullard going to see the latest Adam Sandler trash. When the mother decided to start calling Willard 'Clark' I about died. I didn't expect laughs from this film but, thankfully, the laughs I got were witty and intelligent. Glover plays the misfit Willard, a character that would probably make anyone uncomfortable if you met him in person but when you view his home life and other surroundings you can't help but sympathize with him. Since the movie's plot has been well covered I will just mention that I left the theater feeling 100% satisfied with what I saw.The day the DVD was released I snapped it up. After loving the film a second time I watched the 73 minute documentary added to the disc. What a wonderful insight this was. It was so sad to see how poor the test screenings went. You could see the disappointment and frustration growing on director Glen Morgan's face with each slap from the ignorant public. This is what really burns me. A director dares to steps outside the standard Hollywood formula and the response he gets from the test audience is that it should be more like every other Hollywood film. I'm so bored by films that are nothing but last weeks big hit with a different setting, and occasionally different actors. I can guess most things before they happen and the predictability is stagnating. This film was amazingly original with a lasting effect. I was very pleased to see New Line sticking by their film, allowing the director to only make the changes he wanted to. The new ending they added retained it's dignity and did not detract from the film at all. My only complaint is they should have included the original R rated version as the ""Directors cut"" on the DVD as well.By the end of the documentary the director looks a bit worn and drained. He was proud of his film, as he should be, but just terribly disappointed it made little public impact. I felt so bad for him I just wanted to give him a big hug. I hope he reads these postings from numerous fans of the film and takes comfort that while his film did not find an audience on its initial release, it's doing quite well at building a devoted cult following on video.

It's beautifully crafted, elaborately staged, and clearly used all of its $22 million budget. Pity that writer/director Glenn Morgan seems to have forgotten two things: the importance of plot, and the rather obvious point that a horror movie about swarming rats and their murderous master should, at least momentarily, be terrifying. This is occasionally comic, but mostly lugubrious. We spend half the film waiting for Willard to discover the extent of his power over the rats, and the other half waiting for him to use it effectively. There's the in-your-face subtext of Willard's personal empowerment to think about, of course, but do we ever actually care?  Not really, mainly because Crispin Glover gives his unique but typically alienating two-note performance: embarrassingly violent emoting; and a creepy, wild-eyed, silent writhing somewhere between orgasm and a death rattle. This is ultimately the story of a lonely outsider, so the essence of making it work, at least in terms of characterization, is to give us a guy we can relate to and believe in.  But as played by Glover and directed by Morgan, Willard is more theatrically pitiful than endearing.  The others aren't much better.  Laura Harring just wanders around, apparently wondering what she's doing there, perhaps hoping it might turn out to be as good as ""Mulholland Drive"", while R.

Willard is stuck in a dead-end job that he hates, and he has to care for his elderly mother who constantly belittles him.  His life is miserable, until he finds a white rat dwelling in the basement of his Byzantine home.  He befriends the rat and dubs him Socrates, and to his amazement he finds his basement flooded with other rats who listen to him.  However, a fat rat named Ben comes onto the scene and changes everything.A remake of the 1971 movie, the plot of &quot;Willard&quot; is completely inane but somehow manages to work.  Glover brings an unbelievable amount of likeability to his role, which helps build sympathy for his character.  R. Lee Ermey is also very good as Willard's exceptionally vile boss who eventually gets his just desserts.  Of interest, the pictures of Glover's father that are seen throughout the house are actor Bruce Davison, who played Willard in the original movie.Debut director Glen Morgan (writer of ""Final Destination) employs a rather flashy style that helps ""Willard"" rise above similar B-movies.  The movie also features some much appreciated humor, notably in a scene involving the song ""Ben"" by Michael Jackson.  However, if you watch this movie expecting an explicit horror movie, then you may be a bit disappointed at the relatively gore-free first hour of the movie.  Nevertheless, some of the later scenes are more graphic, and ""Willard"" is ultimately a surprisingly enjoyable movie.Extras: The DVD is packed with extras.  1) An interesting commentary track featuring the director and Crispin Glover. 2) A 17 minute documentary called ""Rat People,"" which features interviews with people who keep rats for pets.  Narrated by Bruce Davison, the documentary features profiles of the rat fans interspersed with hilarious interviews with an exterminator and other rat-haters.  3) A video of Crispin Glover's remake of the song ""Ben,"" which is hilarious.  4) A dozen deleted scenes, some of which show more graphic alternatives.",4,Surprisingly Effective Movie,1078704000,"03 8, 2004",2004,2061,"['quot', 'Willard', 'quot', 'story', '30-something', 'misfit', 'played', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'Willard', 'stuck', 'dead-end', 'job', 'care', 'elderly', 'mother', 'who', 'constantly', 'life', 'miserable', 'white', 'rat', 'dwelling', 'basement', 'Byzantine', 'home', 'rat', 'dubs', 'Socrates', 'amazement', 'basement', 'flooded', 'other', 'rats', 'who', 'listen', 'However', 'fat', 'rat', 'named', 'Ben', 'scene', 'changes', 'everything.A', 'remake', '1971', 'movie', 'plot', 'quot', 'Willard', 'quot', 'completely', 'inane', 'somehow', 'manages', 'work', 'Glover', 'unbelievable', 'amount', 'likeability', 'role', 'build', 'sympathy', 'character', 'R.', 'Lee', 'Ermey', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Willard', 'exceptionally', 'vile', 'boss', 'who', 'eventually', 'just', 'desserts', 'interest', 'pictures', 'Glover', 'father', 'are', 'seen', 'house', 'are', 'actor', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'who', 'played', 'Willard', 'original', 'movie.Debut', 'director', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'writer', 'Final', 'Destination', 'rather', 'flashy', 'style', 'Willard', 'rise', 'similar', 'B-movies', 'movie', 'also', 'much', 'appreciated', 'humor', 'notably', 'scene', 'involving', 'song', 'Ben', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'However', 'watch', 'movie', 'expecting', 'explicit', 'horror', 'movie', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'relatively', 'gore-free', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'Nevertheless', 'later', 'scenes', 'are', 'more', 'graphic', 'Willard', 'ultimately', 'surprisingly', 'enjoyable', 'movie.Extras', 'DVD', 'packed', 'extras', '1', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'track', 'featuring', 'director', 'Crispin', 'Glover', '2', '17', 'minute', 'documentary', 'called', 'Rat', 'People', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'keep', 'rats', 'pets', 'Narrated', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'documentary', 'features', 'profiles', 'rat', 'fans', 'interspersed', 'hilarious', 'interviews', 'exterminator', 'other', 'rat-haters', '3', 'video', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'remake', 'song', 'Ben', 'hilarious', '4', 'dozen', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'show', 'more', 'graphic', 'alternatives']",N/A

Then he's shocked when he finds his mom lying in the stair way dead with rats crawling all over her. So he decides to kill his boss because his boss killed his favorite rat. This movie may not resemble the style of horror film that you're used to. For example when the rats take over he's looking at one and it bites him in the eye and blood squirts out. Or when he's looking over his moms casket and snoot squirts out of his nose. The movies awful, sick, disgusting, and just plain awful. There is no way that I would ever recommend this film to anyone. It is by far the worst film that I have ever seen, if you see this and like it check your self into a mental institution because you have serious problems.",1,It's a Shame 0 Stars Isn't an Option,1089936000,"07 16, 2004",2004,1345,"['Ok', 'was', 'bad', 'films', 'last', 'year', 'Charlie', 'Angels', '2', 'House', '1000', 'Corpses', 'Gothika', 'movie', 'was', 'bad', 'Willard', 'could', 'say', 'movie', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'really', ""n't"", 'even', 'deserve', 'be', 'mentioned', 'same', 'sentences', 'barrels', 'such', 'worthless', 'pathetic', 'film', 'wonder', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'hated', 'probably', 'saw', 'movie', 'film', 'stars', 'Chrispen', 'Glover', 'low', 'beat', 'employee', 'stuck', 'same', 'dead', 'end', 'job', 'owned', 'rich', 'guy', 'who', 'hate', 'One', 'night', 'rats', 'other', 'loser', 'Friends', 'teaches', 'kill', 'people', 'Then', 'shocked', 'when', 'mom', 'lying', 'stair', 'way', 'dead', 'rats', 'crawling', 'kill', 'boss', 'boss', 'killed', 'favorite', 'rat', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'resemble', 'style', 'horror', 'film', ""'re"", 'used', 'example', 'when', 'rats', 'take', 'looking', 'one', 'eye', 'blood', 'squirts', 'out', 'when', 'looking', 'moms', 'casket', 'snoot', 'squirts', 'nose', 'movies', 'awful', 'sick', 'disgusting', 'just', 'plain', 'awful', 'way', 'would', 'ever', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'far', 'worst', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'see', 'check', 'self', 'mental', 'institution', 'have', 'serious', 'problems']",N/A
