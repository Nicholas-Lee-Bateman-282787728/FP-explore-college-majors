It seems that whenever a seller tries to list the Ronald Reagan film CAVALRY CHARGE, it comes out listed under TAMANGO.  If you order one of these $13 items, you will get CAVALRY CHARGE in the mail.

510300,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B00000K3UF,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","On a slave ship carrying Africans from their homeland to slavery in the American south, a charismatic young warrior attempts to organize a revolt. Meanwhile, Dorothy Dandridge plays ship Captain Curd Jurgens' mistress, featuring interracial kissing and sexuality at a time very few American films would go near the subject. Add in that Dandridge's subjugated Lucy, torn between worlds,  is a far more empathetic and complex figure than any white character, and that Tamango and his fellow captives are shown to be in every way - morally, strategically as well as physically -- better than their white captors, and you have a film that was way ahead of it's time.That said, there is odd flat quality in some of the drama and less than thrilling acting and film-making that keep the actual story from living up to it's potential. But it's still pretty involving, and worth seeing at least as a part of films' maturing around racial issues.Interestingly, blacklisted director John Berry, went on to later direct another racially 'ahead of it's time' film; 1974's ""Claudine"", one of the first mainstream American films to try and intelligently deal with the struggles of poor urban African Americans without falling into exploitation, violence or clich&eacute;.The quality of the DVD is OK, but nothing thrilling.  However, given that this important film was so hard to find, it's certainly way better than nothing.",4,"Arguably even more interesting as a social document and a step forward in mainstreams films dealing with race, than as a drama.",1402876800,"06 16, 2014",2014,1411,"['slave', 'ship', 'carrying', 'Africans', 'homeland', 'slavery', 'American', 'south', 'charismatic', 'young', 'warrior', 'attempts', 'organize', 'revolt', 'Meanwhile', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'ship', 'Captain', 'Curd', 'Jurgens', 'mistress', 'featuring', 'interracial', 'kissing', 'sexuality', 'time', 'very', 'few', 'American', 'films', 'would', 'go', 'subject', 'Add', 'Dandridge', 'subjugated', 'Lucy', 'torn', 'worlds', 'far', 'more', 'empathetic', 'complex', 'figure', 'white', 'character', 'Tamango', 'fellow', 'captives', 'are', 'shown', 'be', 'way', 'morally', 'strategically', 'as', 'well', 'physically', 'better', 'white', 'captors', 'have', 'film', 'was', 'way', 'ahead', 'time.That', 'said', 'odd', 'flat', 'quality', 'drama', 'less', 'thrilling', 'acting', 'film-making', 'actual', 'story', 'living', 'up', 'potential', 'still', 'pretty', 'involving', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'part', 'films', 'maturing', 'racial', 'issues.Interestingly', 'blacklisted', 'director', 'John', 'Berry', 'went', 'later', 'direct', 'racially', ""'ahead"", 'time', 'film', '1974', 'Claudine', 'one', 'first', 'mainstream', 'American', 'films', 'try', 'intelligently', 'deal', 'struggles', 'poor', 'urban', 'African', 'Americans', 'falling', 'exploitation', 'violence', 'clich', 'eacute', '.The', 'quality', 'DVD', 'OK', 'nothing', 'thrilling', 'However', 'given', 'important', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'hard', 'find', 'certainly', 'way', 'better', 'nothing']",Tamango VHS
510301,A1K8X0S969E0XL,B00000K3UF,Lauren,"[9, 9]","Tamango is the story of a slave ship, during the early 1800's, on a voyage to Cuba.  Curd J&uuml;rgens plays the captain of the slave ship ~ Dorothy Dandridge plays Aiche, a mulatto/mixed slave who is also the Captain's lover.  When a new slave, Tamango (played by an unknown actor, Alex Cressan) comes aboard, he plans (with the help of the other slaves) to take over the ship so they can return back to Africa to become free again.  While they manage to take over part of the ship, they don't do as well as they planned; but they have taken Aiche hostage.  Aiche must choose to help her fellow slaves, or the Captain (who happens to own her, although he doesn't mistreat her and gives her special treatment).  Dorothy looks beautiful as usual (she grew her hair long for the role) and her acting talent shines all through out the film.  However, I am dissapointed at how cheap the movie was made. A lot of the actors voices have been dubbed (their mouths don't match what they are saying) and the sound and picture quality is not very good.  Also, the ending kind of leaves you wanting more.  &quot;Tamango&quot; never became very popular because sadly in 1959, it was banned in the United States because of the depiction of interracial romance.",3,Dorothy Dandridge saves the movie...,985824000,"03 29, 2001",2001,1247,"['Tamango', 'story', 'slave', 'ship', 'early', '1800', 'voyage', 'Cuba', 'Curd', 'J', 'uuml', 'captain', 'slave', 'ship', '~', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'Aiche', 'mulatto/mixed', 'slave', 'who', 'also', 'Captain', 'lover', 'When', 'new', 'slave', 'Tamango', 'played', 'unknown', 'actor', 'Alex', 'Cressan', 'aboard', 'help', 'other', 'slaves', 'take', 'over', 'ship', 'can', 'return', 'back', 'Africa', 'become', 'free', 'again', 'manage', 'take', 'over', 'part', 'ship', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'as', 'well', 'planned', 'have', 'taken', 'Aiche', 'hostage', 'Aiche', 'must', 'choose', 'help', 'fellow', 'slaves', 'Captain', 'who', 'own', ""n't"", 'mistreat', 'special', 'treatment', 'Dorothy', 'beautiful', 'usual', 'grew', 'hair', 'long', 'role', 'acting', 'talent', 'shines', 'out', 'film', 'However', 'am', 'dissapointed', 'how', 'cheap', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'lot', 'actors', 'voices', 'have', 'been', 'dubbed', 'mouths', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'what', 'are', 'saying', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'Also', 'ending', 'kind', 'leaves', 'wanting', 'more', 'quot', 'Tamango', 'quot', 'never', 'became', 'very', 'popular', 'sadly', '1959', 'was', 'banned', 'United', 'States', 'depiction', 'interracial', 'romance']",Tamango VHS

She plays a slave here even though author Donald Bogle in his definitive Dandridge bio claims Dorothy turned down a supporting role in ""The King and I"" because she didn't want to play a slave. (Incidentally, that ""Tuptim"" role launched Rita Moreno's super long acting career!) But what's a beautiful and talented colored girl to do in racist Hollywood?  Ask Halle.The color quality of this DVD is awful, but Dandridge gets a chance to stretch her acting skills while looking drop dead gorgeous in her late 30's.  But couldn't they have found a better wig for a tragic mulatto?  This one is right off the Korean store dummy. DD tells slaveowner Jurgens she hates when he touches her. Who can blame her?  Jurgens is gross and ugly!One of the best scenes shows how the genuine diva flips her wig and quickly recovers after a slave spits in her pretty face.  In another scene the camera zooms in on Dorothy as she twists and jerks - with incredible style and grace - away from a grizzly old ship doctor who tries to rape her.  She moves like a haughty ballerina!  Only Dorothy Dandrige makes this movie worth watching!

510306,ASL171FXXFVE9,B00000K3UF,W. L Lord,"[7, 7]","A story of a revolt on a slave ship was actually around prior to the more recent Amistad but unfortunately, few seemed to have much interest in it judging from the limited distribution of this film when it first appeared in the conservative atmosphere of the 50's. It was actually banned in France. The objection of course, was the interracial relationship between slave ship captain Curt Jurgens and his slave mistress Aiche (Dorothy Dandridge). When a revolt occurs, Dandridge as a marginalized person tries to stay uninvolved, even though she has some attraction to the revolt leader Tamango. She is not really liked by the African captives as she has ""given"" herself to the white captain and is, of course, viewed as a slave by the white crew members. Curt Jurgens, as a slave ship captain is obviously not the nicest person in the world but seems to have some genuine affection for Aiche and treats her comparatively well. Aiche has suppressed bitter resentment about her slave origins and treatment by former masters and still has hopes for a possible future better life with Jurgens, even after she finds out he has plans to wed a white woman and live in Holland. However, when confronted he claims he will stay with Aiche and even make her a free woman. When the revolt begins she is forced to make a decision where her loyalties lie and tragedy occurs.There are a few problems with this film beyond low budgeting. The African captives, Jurgens and crew,  all mysteriously speak the same language to each other. 1820 muskets are never seen being re-loaded but continue to fire anyway. But technical issues aside, it is still a film with some impact. Jurgens swaggers well as the captain and Dandridge is appealing as Aiche. A pity that the public was not ready for it when it was released and that it is currently not well known. Not to be missed by any Dandridge fan or those wanting to examine the horrors of slavery.",3,Dandridge and Two Worlds,1095811200,"09 22, 2004",2004,1927,"['story', 'revolt', 'slave', 'ship', 'was', 'actually', 'around', 'prior', 'more', 'recent', 'Amistad', 'unfortunately', 'few', 'seemed', 'have', 'much', 'interest', 'judging', 'limited', 'distribution', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'appeared', 'conservative', 'atmosphere', '50', 'was', 'actually', 'banned', 'France', 'objection', 'course', 'was', 'interracial', 'relationship', 'slave', 'ship', 'captain', 'Curt', 'Jurgens', 'slave', 'mistress', 'Aiche', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'When', 'revolt', 'Dandridge', 'marginalized', 'person', 'tries', 'stay', 'uninvolved', 'even', 'attraction', 'revolt', 'leader', 'Tamango', 'not', 'really', 'liked', 'African', 'captives', 'given', 'white', 'captain', 'course', 'viewed', 'slave', 'white', 'crew', 'members', 'Curt', 'Jurgens', 'slave', 'ship', 'captain', 'obviously', 'not', 'nicest', 'person', 'world', 'have', 'genuine', 'affection', 'Aiche', 'comparatively', 'well', 'Aiche', 'suppressed', 'bitter', 'resentment', 'slave', 'origins', 'treatment', 'former', 'masters', 'still', 'hopes', 'possible', 'future', 'better', 'life', 'Jurgens', 'even', 'out', 'plans', 'wed', 'white', 'woman', 'live', 'Holland', 'However', 'when', 'confronted', 'will', 'stay', 'Aiche', 'even', 'make', 'free', 'woman', 'When', 'revolt', 'forced', 'make', 'decision', 'where', 'loyalties', 'lie', 'tragedy', 'are', 'few', 'problems', 'film', 'low', 'budgeting', 'African', 'captives', 'Jurgens', 'crew', 'mysteriously', 'speak', 'same', 'language', 'other', '1820', 'muskets', 'are', 'never', 'seen', 'being', 're-loaded', 'continue', 'fire', 'anyway', 'technical', 'issues', 'aside', 'still', 'film', 'impact', 'swaggers', 'well', 'captain', 'Dandridge', 'appealing', 'Aiche', 'pity', 'public', 'was', 'not', 'ready', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'currently', 'not', 'well', 'known', 'Not', 'be', 'missed', 'Dandridge', 'fan', 'wanting', 'examine', 'horrors', 'slavery']",Tamango VHS
