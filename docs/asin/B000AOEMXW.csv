929672,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000AOEMXW,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Warning Shot, 1967 filmIt is night. Two detectives are on a midnight stakeout for a psychotic killer. They hear footsteps. The police chase a man on foot. Then there is a shot! ""Send for an ambulance."" ""Where's his gun?"" The victim is a doctor. What went wrong? There was not gun found! Dr. James Reston is rich and in society, there will be trouble. There is an inquest. ""There was no gun."" [Did you see one?] Witnesses testify about Sgt. Tom Valens. There is never a warning shot. Did Valens use good judgment? Alice Willows testifies. Dr. Reston made house calls to her; he liked her dog. There is controversy over this shooting. Why did that doctor run from a policeman? What makes a person ""suspicious""? His prior statement is quoted. Valenz is suspended; he is arraigned on manslaughter.The prosecutor explains his background and motivation. His lawyer explains what he plans to do. Can Valens prove his case? A TV show discusses this case. Does he believe in what he says? It's show business! But he knows about Dr. Reston, who married into money. Valens goes to the Seascape Apartment complex to look around. He visits Alice Willows and questions her. Then he meets another resident who talks about a neighbor, a model. Valens calls his ex-wife for help. There is a joke about Yves the fashion designer. Valens learned something about Dr. Reston and his visits at night. Can he search the apartment? They follow their nose. [Nobody smelled anything? No fingerprints in the apartment of Sherry Shannon?] But there is complication from this. His ex-wife visits Tom to console him. ""You stupid fool!""Valens goes to Dr. Reston's office to look around. This office is being inventories. His nurse tells about his practice. ""Oh no!"" Four young men attack him in the hallway! [A new complication!] ""No doctor, no police"" because of how the media could play up this news. Dr. Reston got a stock tip three years ago and became rich. [Insider trading?] Valens learns more about Dr. Reston's practice. Tom visits a stock broker to get financial data. It doesn't work. Dr. Reston visited Alice Willows every Thursday, she says. How good is her memory? Valens visits Mrs. Reston. He meets Rusty. Mrs. Reston is not in mourning. Where did Dr. Reston get his money? She doesn't know, but becomes friendly with Valens. Valens plans a trip.Will someone try to make a murder look like a suicide? A telephone call goes unanswered. ""What's it all about?"" The murder of Liz Thayer! There is an APB out on Tom. Can he get more time? Is there another place where he can dig up more evidence? Yes, he finds what he was looking for! Who is he contact man? Valens figures it out. [Were you surprised?] The good guy with a gun stops the bad guy with a gun. He calls it in: ""officer needs help"". And so this mystery is solved. [This reminds me of a ""Perry Mason"" novel where a minor problem leads to a murder that implicates a client. At the end the murder is solved when the client is found `not guilty'.]The background of this movie tells about the culture of that era (as seen by Hollywood). Chandler's novels also told about the events of Los Angeles. There is a convention in many murder mysteries where a character is introduced early on so he or she can be found guilty at the end.",4,A Murder Mystery with a Message,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,3268,"['Warning', 'Shot', '1967', 'filmIt', 'night', 'Two', 'detectives', 'are', 'midnight', 'stakeout', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'hear', 'footsteps', 'police', 'chase', 'man', 'foot', 'Then', 'shot', 'Send', 'ambulance', 'Where', 'gun', 'victim', 'doctor', 'What', 'went', 'wrong', 'was', 'not', 'gun', 'found', 'Dr.', 'James', 'Reston', 'rich', 'society', 'will', 'be', 'trouble', 'inquest', 'was', 'gun', '[', 'Did', 'see', 'one', ']', 'testify', 'Sgt', 'Tom', 'Valens', 'never', 'warning', 'shot', 'Did', 'Valens', 'use', 'good', 'judgment', 'Alice', 'Willows', 'testifies', 'Dr.', 'Reston', 'made', 'house', 'liked', 'dog', 'controversy', 'shooting', 'Why', 'did', 'doctor', 'run', 'policeman', 'What', 'person', 'suspicious', 'prior', 'statement', 'quoted', 'Valenz', 'suspended', 'arraigned', 'manslaughter.The', 'prosecutor', 'background', 'motivation', 'lawyer', 'what', 'do', 'Can', 'Valens', 'prove', 'case', 'TV', 'show', 'case', 'believe', 'what', 'show', 'business', 'Dr.', 'Reston', 'who', 'married', 'money', 'Seascape', 'Apartment', 'complex', 'look', 'around', 'Alice', 'Willows', 'questions', 'Then', 'resident', 'who', 'neighbor', 'model', 'ex-wife', 'help', 'joke', 'fashion', 'designer', 'Valens', 'learned', 'something', 'Dr.', 'Reston', 'visits', 'night', 'Can', 'search', 'apartment', 'follow', 'nose', '[', 'Nobody', 'smelled', 'anything', 'fingerprints', 'apartment', 'Sherry', 'Shannon', ']', 'complication', 'ex-wife', 'visits', 'Tom', 'console', 'stupid', 'fool', 'Valens', 'Dr.', 'Reston', 'office', 'look', 'around', 'office', 'being', 'inventories', 'nurse', 'tells', 'practice', 'Oh', 'Four', 'young', 'men', 'attack', 'hallway', '[', 'new', 'complication', 'No', 'doctor', 'police', 'how', 'media', 'could', 'play', 'up', 'news', 'Dr.', 'Reston', 'got', 'stock', 'tip', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'became', 'rich', '[', 'Insider', 'trading', ']', 'Valens', 'more', 'Dr.', 'Reston', 'practice', 'Tom', 'stock', 'broker', 'get', 'financial', 'data', ""n't"", 'work', 'Dr.', 'Reston', 'visited', 'Alice', 'Willows', 'Thursday', 'How', 'good', 'memory', 'visits', 'Mrs.', 'Reston', 'Rusty', 'Mrs.', 'Reston', 'not', 'mourning', 'Where', 'did', 'Dr.', 'Reston', 'get', 'money', ""n't"", 'know', 'friendly', 'Valens', 'Valens', 'trip.Will', 'someone', 'try', 'make', 'murder', 'look', 'suicide', 'telephone', 'call', 'unanswered', 'What', 'murder', 'Liz', 'Thayer', 'APB', 'out', 'Tom', 'Can', 'get', 'more', 'time', 'there', 'place', 'where', 'can', 'dig', 'up', 'more', 'evidence', 'Yes', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'Who', 'contact', 'man', 'figures', 'out', '[', 'Were', 'surprised', 'good', 'guy', 'gun', 'bad', 'guy', 'gun', 'officer', 'help', 'so', 'mystery', 'solved', '[', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'novel', 'where', 'minor', 'problem', 'murder', 'client', 'end', 'murder', 'solved', 'when', 'client', 'found', 'not', 'guilty', 'background', 'movie', 'culture', 'era', 'seen', 'Hollywood', 'Chandler', 'novels', 'also', 'told', 'events', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'convention', 'many', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'where', 'character', 'introduced', 'early', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'guilty', 'end']",N/A
929673,AI1QOZ8AMDR3Q,B000AOEMXW,Bruce Burke,"[1, 3]","This is a movie that simply you just have to be a big fan of David Janssen who's acting of course is top-notch as always, to get into this film. This theater movie came out when David Janssen was doing his final season of THE FUGITIVE. He plays a police detective who has cause to shoot an assailant but gets caught up in the ""where did the gun go ?"" scheme which puts him, his career, and life on the line under controversy for killing an innocent man which he goes on trial for. Not even his superior or partner believes his story that he had seen a gun and you won't find out the true answer for that or why until the very end of the movie. The story is very slow-moving and the end is clear but very abrupt leaving yourself to figure out if all ends well.  Don't expect any action at all in this film-there is none. The only thing I do like about it is the cast:  David Janssen, Joan Collins (in a small part), Stephanie Powers (in a small part), Keenan Wynn, Ed Begley, Eleanor Parker, Carroll O'Connor (in a small part), Walter Pigeon, Steve Allen , George Sanders, Sam Wanamaker, George Grizzard, and Lillian Gish. Music score was done by Jerry Goldsmith.  All of these stars have small parts except Janssen which is ok there because that was the main reason I bought this film, but I was expecting a much bigger wow out of it than there actually is. If Janssen had not been in it and if someone I did not care for would have been in his part, I never would have purchased it in the first place.  THE FUGITIVE was a fantastic show which was true drama and action and David Janssen was perfect for that series. The same goes for his performances in HARRY O  and RICHARD DIAMOND- 2 other P.I. detective series that he did. So bottom line: If you are not a Janssen fan, don't bother with this film. If you are, consider it worth a one-time watch.",2,Warning Shot 1967 Movie DVD,1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,1850,"['movie', 'simply', 'just', 'have', 'be', 'big', 'fan', 'David', 'Janssen', 'who', 'acting', 'course', 'top-notch', 'always', 'get', 'film', 'theater', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'David', 'Janssen', 'was', 'doing', 'final', 'season', 'THE', 'FUGITIVE', 'police', 'detective', 'who', 'cause', 'shoot', 'assailant', 'caught', 'up', 'where', 'did', 'gun', 'go', 'scheme', 'career', 'life', 'line', 'controversy', 'killing', 'innocent', 'man', 'trial', 'Not', 'even', 'superior', 'partner', 'story', 'had', 'seen', 'gun', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'true', 'answer', 'why', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'story', 'very', 'slow-moving', 'end', 'clear', 'very', 'abrupt', 'leaving', 'figure', 'out', 'well', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'action', 'film-there', 'none', 'only', 'thing', 'do', 'cast', 'David', 'Janssen', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'small', 'part', 'Stephanie', 'Powers', 'small', 'part', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'Carroll', ""O'Connor"", 'small', 'part', 'Walter', 'Pigeon', 'Steve', 'Allen', 'George', 'Sanders', 'Sam', 'Wanamaker', 'George', 'Grizzard', 'Lillian', 'Gish', 'Music', 'score', 'was', 'done', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'stars', 'have', 'small', 'parts', 'Janssen', 'ok', 'there', 'was', 'main', 'reason', 'bought', 'film', 'was', 'expecting', 'much', 'bigger', 'wow', 'actually', 'Janssen', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'someone', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'purchased', 'first', 'place', 'FUGITIVE', 'was', 'fantastic', 'show', 'was', 'true', 'drama', 'action', 'David', 'Janssen', 'was', 'perfect', 'series', 'same', 'performances', 'HARRY', 'O', 'RICHARD', 'DIAMOND-', '2', 'other', 'P.I', 'detective', 'series', 'did', 'So', 'bottom', 'line', 'are', 'not', 'Janssen', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'film', 'are', 'consider', 'one-time', 'watch']",N/A
929674,A1JCWK43MAGZIG,B000AOEMXW,"By Definition ""By Definition""","[0, 0]","Once again, David Janssen plays the role he does so well -- of a man behind the 8 ball. Down on his luck, depressed, with everyone after him, policeman sergeant Tom Valens is trying to clear his name of a self-defensive shooting he performed in the line of duty, and of course, it's tough going.This film was clearly meant to capitalize on Janssen's great success in the Fugitive series, and with Paramount studios behind it, and a cast filled with high-end cameos from some of Hollywood's best supporting cast members, the results are disappointing. Unfortunately the direction and the music are filled with some of the worst 60's detective-series cliches and make the film seem very dated. This is the worst score I've ever heard from the pen of Jerry Goldsmith, and there are a lot of directorial problems as well There are some  rear projection shots with Janssen and Ed Begley in a car that are so unbelievably off axis, it's dreadfully funny. And the persecution of Tom Valens is painfully heavy handed. A film that so closely follows the Fugitive formula was not helpful to Janssen's career, and keeps him stuck in the same kinds of situations that he faced in the series. But the logic of the career move was to get Janssen's tortured persona onto the big screen, but the production values doom the film to failure.The vendetta against Valens is so bad and and the production so 60s camp in its way that if you have a taste for such things, Warning Shot is actually entertaining.",2,"Campy, formulaic Janssen vehicle",1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,1487,"['Once', 'again', 'David', 'Janssen', 'role', 'so', 'well', 'man', '8', 'ball', 'Down', 'luck', 'depressed', 'everyone', 'policeman', 'sergeant', 'Tom', 'Valens', 'trying', 'clear', 'name', 'self-defensive', 'shooting', 'performed', 'line', 'duty', 'course', 'tough', 'going.This', 'film', 'was', 'clearly', 'meant', 'capitalize', 'Janssen', 'great', 'success', 'Fugitive', 'series', 'Paramount', 'studios', 'cast', 'filled', 'high-end', 'cameos', 'Hollywood', 'best', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'results', 'are', 'disappointing', 'Unfortunately', 'direction', 'music', 'are', 'filled', 'worst', '60', 'detective-series', 'cliches', 'make', 'film', 'seem', 'very', 'dated', 'worst', 'score', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'pen', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'are', 'lot', 'directorial', 'problems', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'rear', 'projection', 'shots', 'Janssen', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'car', 'are', 'so', 'unbelievably', 'axis', 'dreadfully', 'funny', 'persecution', 'Tom', 'Valens', 'painfully', 'heavy', 'handed', 'film', 'so', 'closely', 'Fugitive', 'formula', 'was', 'not', 'helpful', 'Janssen', 'career', 'stuck', 'same', 'kinds', 'situations', 'faced', 'series', 'logic', 'career', 'move', 'was', 'get', 'Janssen', 'tortured', 'persona', 'big', 'screen', 'production', 'values', 'doom', 'film', 'failure.The', 'vendetta', 'Valens', 'so', 'bad', 'production', 'so', '60s', 'camp', 'way', 'have', 'taste', 'such', 'things', 'Warning', 'Shot', 'actually', 'entertaining']",N/A

And, on the dark side of LA, things just keep getting worse. It's bad enough that strangers are steely in their obstinate opposition, but co-workers, pals, a divorcing (but still enamoured) wife, and even man's best friend pose unforeseen pitfalls.  As the erstwhile Fugitive quests for the truth that will clear him, he pursues a path through the maze of a cameo-encrusted cast.  In a way, the appearance of these guest stars makes the movie glitzy in a silly, Sixties sort of way.  But, in another, the airy apathy displayed by these important-seeming personages increases the alienation of the protagonist.  There are digressions that do little but fill in TV-movie time, and the decade's fashion extremes--from rug-lush eyelashes to Edith Head's haute couture--create a datedness that threatens to drag the production into parody.  There are improbable plot devices and a tone of naive preachiness not uncommon in television fare.  But, despite all this, David Janssen's straightforward performance makes this offering worth a watch.",3,Psychedelic Noir,1367884800,"05 7, 2013",2013,1243,"['Blow', 'aside', 'Sixties', 'fluff', 'will', 'find', 'rather', 'natty', 'little', 'Janssen-driven', 'noir', 'core', 'tale', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'everyman/cop', 'who', 'world', 'abruptly', 'turned', 'inside', 'dark', 'side', 'LA', 'things', 'just', 'keep', 'getting', 'worse', 'bad', 'enough', 'strangers', 'are', 'steely', 'obstinate', 'opposition', 'co-workers', 'pals', 'divorcing', 'still', 'enamoured', 'wife', 'even', 'man', 'best', 'friend', 'pose', 'unforeseen', 'pitfalls', 'erstwhile', 'Fugitive', 'quests', 'truth', 'will', 'clear', 'path', 'maze', 'cameo-encrusted', 'cast', 'way', 'appearance', 'guest', 'stars', 'movie', 'glitzy', 'silly', 'Sixties', 'sort', 'way', 'airy', 'apathy', 'displayed', 'important-seeming', 'personages', 'alienation', 'protagonist', 'are', 'digressions', 'do', 'little', 'fill', 'TV-movie', 'time', 'decade', 'fashion', 'extremes', 'rug-lush', 'eyelashes', 'Edith', 'Head', 'haute', 'couture', 'create', 'datedness', 'drag', 'production', 'parody', 'are', 'improbable', 'plot', 'devices', 'tone', 'naive', 'preachiness', 'not', 'uncommon', 'television', 'fare', 'David', 'Janssen', 'straightforward', 'performance', 'offering', 'watch']",N/A

Stars galore, mostly with walk-ons, some featured, such as Keenan Wynn and Ed Begley. One can see Carol O'Connor before he had his Family, Stephanie Powers, before she linked with Robert Wagner, and others would later be names, as well as the never dimmed light of Lillian Gish, the always effective George Sanders and Walter Pidgeon, from the great days of Hollywood before television, and, at the center of the action, one of the true TV stars, David Janssen.  As with most such films, novelty was not the quality most sought,  it was focusing on a key player, getting him into trouble, and having him haul himself out by his bootstraps. Janssen gives one his patented performances, gratifying to see again, and the other stars, including Steve Allen as, what do you think, a TV commentator, doing their bit. For those unfamiliar with these actors, perhaps Joan Collins is one who will be recognized, the film will probably be seen as routine, with none of the exciting camera work so popular today, for those who were movie and tv viewers back then, it will be routine with subsidiary pleasures along the way. You will have to judge whether you fit either of these categories; in any event, by now, it can be considered a bit of television history.",4,OLD AND COMING STARS OF THE MID-60'S,1258329600,"11 16, 2009",2009,1371,"['Whether', 'not', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'film', 'look', 'feel', 'Golden', 'Oldies', 'mid-1960', 'Stars', 'galore', 'mostly', 'walk-ons', 'featured', 'such', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'One', 'can', 'see', 'Carol', ""O'Connor"", 'had', 'Family', 'Stephanie', 'Powers', 'linked', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'others', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'names', 'as', 'well', 'never', 'dimmed', 'light', 'Lillian', 'Gish', 'always', 'effective', 'George', 'Sanders', 'Walter', 'Pidgeon', 'great', 'days', 'Hollywood', 'television', 'center', 'action', 'one', 'true', 'TV', 'stars', 'David', 'Janssen', 'most', 'such', 'films', 'novelty', 'was', 'not', 'quality', 'most', 'sought', 'was', 'focusing', 'key', 'player', 'getting', 'trouble', 'having', 'haul', 'out', 'bootstraps', 'Janssen', 'one', 'patented', 'performances', 'gratifying', 'see', 'again', 'other', 'stars', 'including', 'Steve', 'Allen', 'what', 'do', 'think', 'TV', 'commentator', 'doing', 'bit', 'unfamiliar', 'actors', 'perhaps', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'recognized', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'seen', 'routine', 'none', 'exciting', 'camera', 'work', 'so', 'popular', 'today', 'who', 'were', 'movie', 'tv', 'viewers', 'back', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'routine', 'subsidiary', 'pleasures', 'way', 'will', 'have', 'judge', 'fit', 'categories', 'event', 'now', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'bit', 'television', 'history']",N/A
929677,A27I3333KUUDXJ,B000AOEMXW,Guss H.,"[3, 3]","Here we have a mystery/drama with David Janssen as a man fighting to clear his name for a crime he did not do. Wow, how original. Actually, I really like this film and was very pleased to find it on DVD.Though it has a low-budget feel, it is well written and directed with Janssen giving his usual understated performance. He gets excellent support from a cast that is a who's who of hollywood legends. Among them Walter Pigeon, Carrol O'Conner, Joan Collins(at the prime of her young beauty) Keenan Wynn and Stephanie Powers. Janssen made this while on hiatus between seasons three and four of The Fugitive. Reportedly, he was already planning on his 4th season as televisions most wanted man to be his last and was hoping to turn his smallscreen succsess into big screen stardom. (Being a Movie star was his life long dream that eluded him) Sadly, none of his post Fugitive feature films did very well box office wise, and by the early 70's he was back on TV where he  was always in demand until his untimely death in 1980. His tall, intense figure fits the role fine in Warning Shot as a police detective charged with excessive force, he shot a suspect and no one believes him that the man drew on him first. The title is a good play on the cop-movie practice of firing a shot in the air to warn or persuade a suspect to surrender. Something that is not done in real life in any city in the country. That issue is adressed in the film at his initial hearing. It's explained that a round fired any where but at the target could strike an innocent even blocks away. Much like how for years, in western and crime films we saw the good guy shoot the gun out of someones hand.Warning Shoot is highly recommended for fans of film-noir and especially for David Janssen fans.  One last thing, recently, while watching this film and seeing Janssen playing a police officer and rattling off official jargon I had a ""What If"" thought. Suppose someone else had been cast as Dr. Richard Kimble. Say Tony Franciosa or James Franciscus who were leading picks for the role by the network until series creator Roy Huggins and producer Quinn Martin insisted on David Janssen. And then what if Janssen would have been brought on board to play Lt. Phillip Gerard? I'm glad it didn't turn out that way, but even if it had, he would have been convincing. Janssen was one of the most underrated actors of his day, and left us much too soon.",4,"Miss ya, David",1218585600,"08 13, 2008",2008,2420,"['Here', 'have', 'mystery/drama', 'David', 'Janssen', 'man', 'fighting', 'clear', 'name', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'Wow', 'how', 'original', 'Actually', 'really', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'find', 'DVD.Though', 'low-budget', 'feel', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'Janssen', 'giving', 'usual', 'understated', 'performance', 'excellent', 'support', 'cast', 'who', 'who', 'hollywood', 'legends', 'Walter', 'Pigeon', 'Carrol', ""O'Conner"", 'Joan', 'Collins', 'prime', 'young', 'beauty', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'Stephanie', 'Powers', 'Janssen', 'made', 'while', 'hiatus', 'seasons', 'three', 'four', 'Fugitive', 'Reportedly', 'was', 'already', 'planning', '4th', 'season', 'televisions', 'most', 'wanted', 'man', 'be', 'last', 'was', 'hoping', 'turn', 'smallscreen', 'succsess', 'big', 'screen', 'stardom', 'Being', 'Movie', 'star', 'was', 'life', 'long', 'dream', 'eluded', 'Sadly', 'none', 'post', 'Fugitive', 'feature', 'films', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'wise', 'early', '70', 'was', 'back', 'TV', 'where', 'was', 'always', 'demand', 'untimely', 'death', '1980', 'tall', 'intense', 'figure', 'role', 'fine', 'Warning', 'Shot', 'police', 'detective', 'charged', 'excessive', 'force', 'shot', 'suspect', 'one', 'man', 'drew', 'first', 'title', 'good', 'play', 'cop-movie', 'practice', 'firing', 'shot', 'air', 'warn', 'persuade', 'suspect', 'surrender', 'Something', 'not', 'done', 'real', 'life', 'city', 'country', 'issue', 'adressed', 'film', 'initial', 'hearing', 'explained', 'round', 'fired', 'where', 'target', 'could', 'strike', 'innocent', 'even', 'away', 'Much', 'how', 'years', 'western', 'crime', 'films', 'saw', 'good', 'guy', 'shoot', 'gun', 'someones', 'hand.Warning', 'Shoot', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'film-noir', 'especially', 'David', 'Janssen', 'fans', 'One', 'last', 'thing', 'recently', 'watching', 'film', 'seeing', 'Janssen', 'playing', 'police', 'officer', 'rattling', 'off', 'official', 'jargon', 'had', 'What', 'thought', 'Suppose', 'someone', 'else', 'had', 'been', 'cast', 'Dr.', 'Richard', 'Kimble', 'Say', 'Tony', 'Franciosa', 'James', 'Franciscus', 'who', 'were', 'leading', 'picks', 'role', 'network', 'series', 'creator', 'Roy', 'Huggins', 'producer', 'Quinn', 'Martin', 'insisted', 'David', 'Janssen', 'then', 'what', 'Janssen', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'brought', 'board', 'play', 'Lt.', 'Phillip', 'Gerard', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'way', 'even', 'had', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'convincing', 'Janssen', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'actors', 'day', 'left', 'much', 'too', 'soon']",N/A
929678,A21ERQVE9KUDJS,B000AOEMXW,Harry Orwell,"[35, 35]","Warning Shot has been a personal favourite for many years. It stars David Janssen in what I consider to be one of his best screen roles: that of Sgt Tom Valens.  Without giving too much away, Valens is accused of shooting an innocent man, a doctor, while on a stakeout.  He insists the doctor pulled a gun on him, but no gun can be found at the scene.  Can Valens find it and prove himself innocent?  It means discrediting a hitherto saintly man who, it seems, never did anything but good in his life.Janssen is superb in this role!  He underplays for all he is worth and that, essentially, was his greatest strength as an actor.  It's a subtle, low-key study in desperation, and no one did this sort of thing better.And what a cast!  Some of these great names only have cameo appearances, but here is the line up:Ed Begley - Valen's bull-necked CaptainKeenan Wyn - A fellow Sergeant who can't quite believe his friend is innocentSam Wanamaker - a cop hater and prosecuting attorney; out to nail Valens in courtLillian Gish - a dotty old lady and former patient of the good doctorStefanie Powers - the doctor's former secretaryEleanor Parker - the doctor's heavy drinking, but still glamorous, widowGeorge Grizzard - a tenant at the apartment block where the doctor was shot, who divides his time between being a private pilot, and having a whale of a time with his bikini clad, babe neighbours!George Sanders - an unctuous, smooth, stock broker who looked after the doctor's finances.Steve Allen - what else, a talk show host, but this time with a nice line in playing devil's advocateCarroll O'Connor - head of the preliminary hearing at which Valens is committed for trialJoan Collins - Valen's estranged wifeWalter Pidgeon - a renowned defence attorneyAndVito Scotti - a slightly over-the-top, camp fashion designerAll are very effective, but Sam Wanamaker, George Sanders, Steve Allen, Ed Begley and George Grizzard are just superb, and Eleanor Parker makes a fantastic lush.

929681,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000AOEMXW,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[11, 13]","Film noir had aged some twenty years when Warning Shot came out.  The film applies some of the traditional noir elements by being shot in a city, shadows, and with a bleak approach to the notion of ends justifying the means.  It enters a world where the society turns its back on a public servant - a police officer, and leaves him to fend for himself.  Yet, it is not a film noir.  It is not even neo-noir, as the film continues to leave a trace of hope and a strong moral sense that lingers throughout the film.The film opens at a stakeout where police sergeant Tom Valens (David Janssen) and his partner (Keenan Wynn) tries to entrap a psycho killer, which is the way they refer to the murderer they are trying to capture.  The stakeout is planned in the manner where one person sits alone and hides behind a bush while his partner sits in the car, which is somewhat baffling in regards to safety.  Anyway, Valens awaits the killer to arrive when a little puppy emerges followed by a strange man that runs away after he has identified himself. It turns into a brief foot-hunt through the (smoke-machine) fog, which ends with the man pulling out what seems to be a revolver from his coat pocket.  Valens reacts and fires his gun.The man that Valens has shot turns out to be Dr. James B. Ruston, and later the police cannot find the gun that Dr. Ruston supposedly had in his pocket.  It is unfortunate for Valens who is suspended from fieldwork until the investigation is over, but he cannot resist searching for the gun and the motive of why Dr. Ruston was at the location at the late hour.  However, he does not find the answers he tries to find, and instead ends up in bigger problems when the district attorney has decided to try him for murder.  If he did not have enough problems, his divorce with his wife, played by Joan Collins, is also about to be finalized.  Despite the bleak outlook, Valens does not give up while he continues to search for the truth by probing and asking questions that could free him from guilt.The film does not reach its full potential, as there is some awkwardness within the film.  Somehow this film provides an atmosphere of a stage, or a set, which happens mostly when the scenes are shot indoors.  The angles and sharpness of shadows thrown by characters and the mise-en-scene accentuate an unnatural environment, which removes some of the genuine suspense.  The problem seems to rest with the lighting.  There are also a few scenes where the film tries to apply some humor to the film, but it is rather irrelevant to the story itself.  This also causes some friction within the main story, as it diverts the audience's attention from what is important for no apparent reason.  Despite the cinematic flaw, Warning shot presents a somewhat intriguing story that helps provides a springboard for future police films, as the terrific supporting cast supports the lead when he seeks his own innocence.",3,Where Did that Gun Go?,1131840000,"11 13, 2005",2005,2937,"['Film', 'noir', 'had', 'aged', 'twenty', 'years', 'when', 'Warning', 'Shot', 'came', 'out', 'film', 'traditional', 'noir', 'elements', 'being', 'shot', 'city', 'shadows', 'bleak', 'approach', 'notion', 'ends', 'justifying', 'means', 'world', 'where', 'society', 'back', 'public', 'servant', 'police', 'officer', 'fend', 'Yet', 'not', 'film', 'noir', 'not', 'even', 'neo-noir', 'film', 'leave', 'trace', 'hope', 'strong', 'moral', 'sense', 'film.The', 'film', 'stakeout', 'where', 'police', 'sergeant', 'Tom', 'Valens', 'David', 'Janssen', 'partner', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'entrap', 'psycho', 'killer', 'way', 'refer', 'murderer', 'are', 'trying', 'capture', 'stakeout', 'planned', 'manner', 'where', 'one', 'person', 'alone', 'hides', 'bush', 'partner', 'sits', 'car', 'somewhat', 'baffling', 'regards', 'safety', 'Anyway', 'Valens', 'killer', 'arrive', 'when', 'little', 'puppy', 'emerges', 'followed', 'strange', 'man', 'away', 'identified', 'brief', 'foot-hunt', 'smoke-machine', 'fog', 'man', 'pulling', 'out', 'what', 'be', 'revolver', 'coat', 'pocket', 'reacts', 'gun.The', 'man', 'shot', 'out', 'be', 'Dr.', 'James', 'B.', 'Ruston', 'later', 'police', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'gun', 'Dr.', 'Ruston', 'supposedly', 'had', 'pocket', 'unfortunate', 'Valens', 'who', 'suspended', 'fieldwork', 'investigation', 'can', 'not', 'resist', 'searching', 'gun', 'motive', 'why', 'Dr.', 'Ruston', 'was', 'location', 'late', 'hour', 'However', 'not', 'find', 'answers', 'find', 'instead', 'up', 'bigger', 'problems', 'when', 'district', 'attorney', 'decided', 'try', 'murder', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'problems', 'divorce', 'wife', 'played', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'also', 'be', 'finalized', 'bleak', 'outlook', 'Valens', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'search', 'truth', 'probing', 'asking', 'questions', 'could', 'free', 'guilt.The', 'film', 'not', 'reach', 'full', 'potential', 'awkwardness', 'film', 'Somehow', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'stage', 'set', 'mostly', 'when', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'indoors', 'angles', 'sharpness', 'shadows', 'thrown', 'characters', 'mise-en-scene', 'accentuate', 'unnatural', 'environment', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'problem', 'rest', 'lighting', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'film', 'tries', 'apply', 'humor', 'film', 'rather', 'irrelevant', 'story', 'also', 'friction', 'main', 'story', 'audience', 'attention', 'what', 'important', 'apparent', 'reason', 'cinematic', 'flaw', 'Warning', 'shot', 'somewhat', 'intriguing', 'story', 'springboard', 'future', 'police', 'films', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'cast', 'lead', 'when', 'own', 'innocence']",N/A
