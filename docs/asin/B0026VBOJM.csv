1252092,A35W0CHESO3FMW,B0026VBOJM,"Charles D. Fulton ""foultone""","[0, 3]","Pt I: NO GREATER LOVE Sprawling WWII drama that pits idealist Kaji against the Japanese war machine. He takes on a job as a labor camp supervisor in China to avoid the draft, which itself compromises his ideals, but you wouldn't know it from his insufferable holier-than-thou posturing. His dickishness really drags the 1st part of the movie down, but the momentum of the story's events makes the last hour riveting. Great Ford-like use of landscapes in key scenes: starving Chinese prisoners attacking a food truck, shots (like the one on the DVD box) of slaves en route to the mine, the arrival of the ""comfort women"" at the camp. Bold dutch angles in an execution scene make for an interesting contrast to PATHS OF GLORY. 7/10",4,Pt I: NO GREATER LOVE,1315008000,"09 3, 2011",2011,729,"['Pt', 'NO', 'GREATER', 'LOVE', 'Sprawling', 'WWII', 'drama', 'idealist', 'Kaji', 'Japanese', 'war', 'machine', 'job', 'labor', 'camp', 'supervisor', 'China', 'avoid', 'draft', 'ideals', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'insufferable', 'holier-than-thou', 'posturing', 'dickishness', 'really', '1st', 'part', 'movie', 'down', 'momentum', 'story', 'events', 'last', 'hour', 'riveting', 'Great', 'Ford-like', 'use', 'landscapes', 'key', 'scenes', 'starving', 'Chinese', 'prisoners', 'attacking', 'food', 'truck', 'shots', 'one', 'DVD', 'box', 'slaves', 'route', 'mine', 'arrival', 'comfort', 'women', 'camp', 'Bold', 'dutch', 'angles', 'execution', 'scene', 'make', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'PATHS', 'OF', 'GLORY', '7/10']",The Human Condition
1252093,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B0026VBOJM,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[4, 10]","The Human Condition has too many technical flaws, goes on too long, and, especially, its first 60% gets annoyingly moralistic and preachy at times (although Kaji does sink into a bit of justifiable depravity by film's end), to be considered an inarguably great film, but so much of the rest of it is assuredly great that it has to be in the argument for greatness, therefore I can term it a near-great film, even if, for many, it will seem an irredeemably depressing film; not unlike Theo Angelopoulos's The Weeping Meadow. This observation is true, but it is not a reason to avoid the film, nor art, because a work of art that depresses is not to say that it is not successful for that, if its depression spurs one on to cogitation over why this is. Also, criticism of the love that Kaji holds for his wife are all based on the assumption that the lead character is supposed to be an idealization of the average man rather than an example of the rare man, the potentially great man, who is denied his due. Therefore, the commonplace qualities of love and fidelity that a superior man holds become, in this misinterpretation, an idealized and unrealistically (capital r) Romantic flaw. But that is the flaw of the critics, not the artist.The film's equivocal excellence is probably no better exemplified than in its portrait of the Japanese Army. On the one hand the film seems to go a bit too light in its portrayal of the Japanese mistreatment of its Chinese victims (for with every passing year it seems that the Japanese Imperial Army made the Nazis seem like rank amateurs in human depravity), yet, on the other hand, the film does a great service in its humanizing of the average Japanese soldier from inhuman automatonic supermen to flawed misfits who often criticize and mock their superiors and the war's rightness. And while it abounds in caricatures and near-caricatures, the film also does an outstanding job of getting to specific moments of intensity (however prosaically- not poetically- rendered) between characters, in what would otherwise seem a mundane interaction. This allows for the speedy introduction of characters and building of empathy with them.The DVD, by The Criterion Collection, is one of the best releases they have had in the last couple of years. I've chided the company for skimping on audio commentaries in recent years, but this film's length, and the fact that it is spread over three disks, pretty much obviates any necessity for a commentary, and even an enthusiastic talking head like Japanese film expert Donald Richie or film critic Roger Ebert (were he healthy) would inevitably spend most of the nine plus hours on dead air. As usual, I wish all black and white films had easier to read subtitles than mere white font, but there are only a few instances of difficult to read wordings. Given that this film had an international release at a time when foreign films were routinely dubbed, it would have been great to have had an English language audio dubbed option, for likely one existed. There is an oddity in that there are Japanese subtitles on the right side of the screen for the Japanese audience, at moments characters speak Chinese. The fourth disk has all the supplements, and while it is missing an extended making of featurette, there are some good moments in interviews conducted with the film's director and star, and a short video bon mot of the film from Japanese filmmaker Masahiro Shinoda. There are some trailers and an insert essay, as well. But, this is there are DVD where the extras are really just that. Even with nothing, this film is worth seeing. It is also a very good restoration, in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, of the film compared to earlier VHS and DVD releases, many of which split the film into its three parts: No Greater Love (1959), Road To Eternity (1960), and A Soldier's Prayer (1961).The film's cinematography, by Yoshio Miyajima, is always solid, with a few moments of adventure- such as a shot as a tank roars overhead, but it is never spectacular. The scenes shot in a studio often clash with location shots, texturally. As for the use of black and white, no one is liable to confuse this film with the masterworks of an Orson Welles nor Michelangelo Antonioni. The film's score is one of its weakest elements, too often telegraphing `important' moments. Nakasdai's acting dominates the film, for he is in virtually ever scene, and his slow transmogrification from bleeding heart liberal who sells out to stoic killing machine (he's an excellent soldier despite his avowed humanism) who years for his wife is subtle, believable, and most importantly, lets the viewer empathize with him. There is never a moment where a viewer will think that Kaji would never do that; even in scenes where he stabs a Russian soldier or when he beats a Japanese Quisling, in the POW camp, to death with a steel chain, and pushes him into a latrine hole to drown. Of the many films I've seen in my decades there are few other film characters I have ever more identified with than Kaji (who is the Orient's equivalent of Kirk Douglas's Colonel Dax in Paths Of Glory). Granted, I am both more practical and prone to dispense justice more violently, but one of the film's strengths is that it offers a myriad of characters (and some which veer into caricatures) that all viewers can identify with; at least on the masculine side. Like most directors of his age, Kobayashi severely shortshrifts the female sex- they are either whores or angels, but, putting aside that unfortunate malady, Kobayashi is rare in that he is even able to humanize his caricatures.The Human Condition is one of those works of art that is not great, but has so much going on, at any moment, that it is not difficult to forgive its flaws- even those that glare, for another excellent or better moment will soon recapture your admiration. And, it's only in true epics that such largess is to be found.

Launay,"[37, 41]","How should an individual respond to deep-set social injustices - ones that are built into the structure of the country's national morality.  This is the core of Kaji's story (performed by the brilliant Tatsuya Nakadai).  This epic trilogy is a biography of a man, a dissenter, a nation.  During the critical years 1930's to 1940's, Japanese aggression was founded on radical nationalism, a policy which expected everything in its path to bend or break.  The director films the cruelty of Japanese and Russian authority with unflinching honesty. As is always true of this director...he is an absolute master of cinematography in the brilliant way we think Akira Kurusowa is a master of the same art.  As an example, after one of the Chinese slave laborers is brutally beaten to death, the group of laborers complain to Kaji - accusing him of being just like the other insensitive Japanese. The crowd of prisoners and Kaji are separated by an electric barbed wire.  Then suddenly - through the barbed wire - the prisoners view 30 comfort women approaching to service them sexually...almost as a mirage...and the complaint against Kaji drips away. It is a deeply powerful image - a form of cinema poetry and a form of cinema realism.In the first installment of this extraordinary trilogy,  Kaji is sent to be an overseer of a Japanese slave labor camp in Manchuria.  At this time, the Japanese are using Chinese men or unlucky POW's for mining operations under inhuman, horrific conditions.  Appalled by the viciousness, Kaji proposes reforms and basic human rights for the prisoners...but in doing so he is considered an obstacle to the Japanese War effort and so the idealist is next sent into the military.  In the second installment,  Kaji challenges the military officers' cruel approach and humiliation of Japanese recruits. Again, he is unsuccessful.  This leads him to the third part where the Japanese army is routed by the Soviets. But the Russians are not the liberators the liberals believe them to be. Now for the third time, Kaji refuses to accept the Russian injustices.What seems ""all important"" to the director Kobayashi is not the success of his quiet hero, but the very attempt - however futile - to challenge injustice, even alone.  Here we have a conscientious objector, sometimes portrayed by others as weak, who is actually more ready to put his life on the line than the soldiers.As a final point, the film trilogy is part autobiographical.  Even though a soldier in the Japanese army, the film director Kobayashi refused to accept any position in the Japanese military system other than a private as a personal protest to its aggressive fascism.Five stars...absolutely.",5,Be Prepared to be Shattered,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,2691,"['How', 'should', 'individual', 'respond', 'deep-set', 'social', 'injustices', 'ones', 'are', 'built', 'structure', 'country', 'national', 'morality', 'core', 'Kaji', 'story', 'performed', 'brilliant', 'Tatsuya', 'Nakadai', 'epic', 'trilogy', 'biography', 'man', 'dissenter', 'nation', 'critical', 'years', '1930', '1940', 'Japanese', 'aggression', 'was', 'founded', 'radical', 'nationalism', 'policy', 'expected', 'everything', 'path', 'bend', 'break', 'director', 'films', 'cruelty', 'Japanese', 'Russian', 'authority', 'unflinching', 'honesty', 'always', 'true', 'director', 'absolute', 'master', 'cinematography', 'brilliant', 'way', 'think', 'Akira', 'Kurusowa', 'master', 'same', 'art', 'example', 'one', 'Chinese', 'slave', 'laborers', 'brutally', 'beaten', 'death', 'group', 'laborers', 'complain', 'Kaji', 'accusing', 'being', 'just', 'other', 'insensitive', 'Japanese', 'crowd', 'prisoners', 'Kaji', 'are', 'separated', 'electric', 'barbed', 'wire', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'barbed', 'wire', 'prisoners', 'view', '30', 'comfort', 'women', 'approaching', 'service', 'sexually', 'almost', 'mirage', 'complaint', 'Kaji', 'away', 'deeply', 'powerful', 'image', 'form', 'cinema', 'poetry', 'form', 'cinema', 'realism.In', 'first', 'installment', 'extraordinary', 'trilogy', 'Kaji', 'sent', 'be', 'overseer', 'Japanese', 'slave', 'labor', 'camp', 'Manchuria', 'time', 'Japanese', 'are', 'using', 'Chinese', 'men', 'unlucky', 'POW', 'mining', 'operations', 'inhuman', 'horrific', 'conditions', 'Appalled', 'viciousness', 'Kaji', 'reforms', 'basic', 'human', 'rights', 'prisoners', 'doing', 'so', 'considered', 'obstacle', 'Japanese', 'War', 'effort', 'so', 'idealist', 'next', 'sent', 'military', 'second', 'installment', 'Kaji', 'military', 'officers', 'cruel', 'approach', 'humiliation', 'Japanese', 'recruits', 'Again', 'unsuccessful', 'third', 'part', 'where', 'Japanese', 'army', 'routed', 'Soviets', 'Russians', 'are', 'not', 'liberators', 'liberals', 'believe', 'be', 'Now', 'third', 'time', 'Kaji', 'accept', 'Russian', 'injustices.What', 'important', 'director', 'Kobayashi', 'not', 'success', 'quiet', 'hero', 'very', 'attempt', 'however', 'futile', 'challenge', 'injustice', 'even', 'alone', 'Here', 'have', 'conscientious', 'objector', 'sometimes', 'portrayed', 'others', 'weak', 'who', 'actually', 'more', 'ready', 'put', 'life', 'line', 'soldiers.As', 'final', 'point', 'film', 'trilogy', 'part', 'autobiographical', 'Even', 'soldier', 'Japanese', 'army', 'film', 'director', 'Kobayashi', 'refused', 'accept', 'position', 'Japanese', 'military', 'system', 'other', 'private', 'personal', 'protest', 'aggressive', 'fascism.Five', 'stars', 'absolutely']",The Human Condition

If you personally have trouble acknowledging guilt, and especially if you have trouble acknowledging societal guilt -- that is, your unescapable personal responsibility for the actions of your society -- you must watch this film. On the other hand, if you are Chinese, you perhaps ought to avoid this film; it is a soul-rending confession of the hideous cruelty practiced in forced labor camps. It will be too painful to watch, and it might well inflame resentments that would better be put on ice.The Human Condition is beautifully photographed in black-and-white, every frame a calligraphic composition; beautifully acted by Nakadai Tatsuyo and a cast of familiar faces from the great age of samurai films, familiar yet completely 'in character' in this film; beautifully scripted ... and extremely long, 4 DVDs worth of bleak landscape, violence, and anguish.Did it need to be so long? Director Kobayashi Masaki must have thought so; he worked on this film for four years, and his other supreme cinema masterpiece - Harakiri - demonstrates his mastery of terse editing and compaction of drama. Though it has 'chapter' titles, The Human Condition is NOT a series of episodes; it develops thoroughly and coherently as a single story. Critics have suggested that the central character, a young Japanese intellectual who resists the inhuman behaviors of his countrymen, is at least partially a self-depiction by Kobayashi, who was compelled to serve in the Japanese army in WW2 but who refused to rise above the lowest rank, in daring protest against the military warlords. Every scene of The Human Condition conveys, to me at least, a sense of the overwhelming importance of the total Truth to the filmmaker. Obviously Kobayashi was not seeking to produce an evening's entertainment, or a commercial bonanza, or even Art for art's sake. So, yes, I think it needs to be that long.

1252099,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0026VBOJM,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[75, 75]","Masaki Kobayashi, the acclaimed director of Japanese classics such as ""HARA-KIRI"" and ""Samurai Rebellion"" has always made a powerful stance against established authority. He made a scathing indictment of the ""Code of Bushido"" and criticized the way samurai clans have treated its retainers and their families. Kobayashi's ""THE HUMAN CONDITION"" is his fearless indictment of the war itself that criticizes established authority. Based on the novel by Jumpei Gomikawa, this film trilogy is arguably Kobayashi's finest films, its strong existential themes, the manner of which it exposes the aspects of good and evil, and the thin line between morality and immorality is truly masterful. The trilogy focuses on the exploits of Kaji during World War II. Kaji's development as a man, as a husband, as a soldier, and later as a prisoner of war is brought to exposition by Masaki Kobayashi.Disc One: ""No Greater Love"" (1959)Kaji (Tatasuya Nakadai) is a young man who is a pacifist and a socialist. He marries his sweetheart Michiko (Michiyo Aratama) despite the uncertainties in the future. Kaji agrees to work as a mining supervisor in an iron and ore mining site in Japanese-occupied Manchuria to avoid getting drafted to fight a war he doesn't believe in. Kaji becomes partly successful in reforming the working conditions in the mining site, although his ideas are often contested by his superiors. Things become more complicated when Chinese prisoners of war are forced upon the site by the Kempeitai (military police) to use as laborers. Kaji tries but fails to reconcile his humanistic theories with the realities of forced slave labor under Japan's Imperial system.Disc Two: ""Road To Eternity"" (1959)After the climactic confrontation with the Chinese prisoners caused Kaji to lose his exemption from being drafted in the military and the fact that Japan is losing the war which makes the country more desperate for military servicemen, Kaji is now a hardened idealist. Despite being trained to fight a war he doesn't believe in, Kaji proves himself a capable soldier and tries to implement his humanistic idealism to the treatment of other enlisted men who are being brutalized by the veterans. The film reaches its unforgettable climax as Kaji is sent to the front line to fight off the advancing Soviet army.Disc Three: ""A Soldier's Prayer"" (1961)The Japanese Kwantung army is shattered as Kaji, along with several survivors embark on an epic journey on foot through miles of forest, desert, and fields southward in the hopes of reuniting with his wife. After Kaji survives perils including starvation and untrustworthy allies, he gets captured by Soviet forces that echoes the treatment of the Chinese prisoners meted out by the Japanese in the first film. Kaji eventually becomes disappointed that communism which he hoped would be the catalyst for human liberation, seemed no different from the oppressive systems he had struggled against. Kaji escapes into the winter wasteland in the hopes of reuniting with his wife Michiko.The Review:Hailed as ""One of the Greatest Films Ever Made"", ""The Human Condition"" is one film whose experience may seem inspirational but it also proves utterly depressing. This trilogy embodies both the flaws and strengths of humanity as it unrelentingly brings the faces of morality and decency into opposing sides against the natural instincts of men. The film may also prove to be inspirational as love and decency seemingly tries to find a way to survive amid the bleakness of whatever situation fate may deal one into.The First film is the longest film of the three as Kaji takes his theories to improve the working conditions of the mining site. This is Kaji at his purest form as he tries to bring his theories into procedure. This is also where the main protagonists are faced with moral dilemmas as they try to weigh the rights and the wrongs. I loved the scenes when Kaji begins to question himself for his own decisions and the more he gets deeper into the situation with the Chinese prisoners, the more difficult it gets for him to face his wife. Kaji manages the rations and rewards the prisoners with prostitutes. The film makes a powerful statement in pointing out the potential successes of working together as embodied by the Chinese, but mistrust and suspicion becomes the main opposition for two races to work together. It also bleakly portrays the two sides of human nature as there are those who would stand to profit or take advantage of any situation at the cost of others; as kindness and understanding may sometimes prove to produce mixed results.The second part of the film series portrays Kaji in the military, under suspicion because of his revolutionary ideas. The film exposes the politics in the military and the way, soldiers tend to mimic their superiors in the way they treat new recruits. In my opinion, this part is the most damaging critical indictment of the army. Kaji represents the reasonable side of the picture as he tries to protect the new recruits whose ages range from 40 years and above. At times, the majority of the Japanese authority are too willing to turn a blind eye to the problems faced by the new recruits as the veterans appear adamant in abusing them. The adage; ""Survival of the Fittest"" comes to mind, as Kaji is brought to the breaking point. Kobayashi also brings some visceral scenes of brutality and violence in this film. The Soviet advance into China brings both veterans and new recruits on the same side as they try to work out their differences.""Road To Eternity"" also defines the word courage. Kaji's main goal is to survive that may make him seem a coward in the eyes of some but inside, he is courageous enough to admit that this fight is meaningless. For Kaji and his allies, it becomes disgraceful to die in a war like a dog. Kobayashi may also be making a commentary against blind obedience and that the Japanese army were more occupied in believing in their `honorable' war, than facing reality that their goals may indeed prove to be unjust. For Kaji, fighting this battle is more for a fight for survival than fighting for his own country.""A Soldier's Prayer"" may well be the darkest and the most depressing installment of the three. While it does have its inspirational side, as it also exposes the strengths of humanity. Kaji finds reasons to hope, and to dream of freedom; in the hopes of reuniting with Michiko. This chapter also brings Kaji face to face with his morals as he is oftentimes forced to make decisions for the good of the many rather than the needs of the few. Children and old people have no place in this world, as the group is faced with starvation. This chapter also brings the consequences of being on the losing side of the war, as Japanese refugees are left aimless, hungry as the women are raped and abused, not just by Soviets but also by the Japanese themselves. There is a very disquieting sequence as a young girl retains of hope of reuniting with her parents despite being raped by the soldiers of the Red Army. She finds those hopes dashed when she becomes victimized by the very soldiers who were supposed to protect her. I found it hard to see some Japanese women offer themselves up as sex slaves to survive, at least until they can find male protection.I suppose Kobayashi wanted to make a commentary on the manner that people tend to look out for themselves. It was real disturbing to see the Japanese prey on their own countrymen, most specifically in the POW camp. It was quite sad to see the Japanese prisoners become more abused by their fellow countrymen than by their own captors. Kaji and Terada would take food scraps to add to their rations, reported as sabotage by their Japanese superiors. Kaji tries to stay true to his own unwavering beliefs, but it is the evil done by his own countrymen that pushes him over his limits. Anger, envy, greed and pride are the film's main themes as the prisoners of war become faced with a situation worst than those experienced by the Chinese in the mining camps. Worst not because of the hardships, but made worst because of the fact that it is the Japanese abusing the Japanese.Kaji is superbly portrayed by Tatsuya Nakadai. The man embodies the pride that one takes from himself, that pride slowly fades when forced into situations that makes him question his own soul. Education and principle are indeed virtues but one would never know just how one can react to a dilemma until faced with one. Other characters such as Okishima and Kageyama are also at the mercy of military policies and politics; even though they disagree with such policies, they still give in. It is difficult to stay true to oneself when faced with a truly testing situation. Michiko embodies the soul of the Japanese wife; true and faithful. However, the film brings a certain question as to her true whereabouts. Did Michiko manage to escape or did she fall prey to the tests of the flesh?""The Human Condition"" is Japanese cinema at its best. It is very difficult to sit through the film due to its very depressing themes but one has to also see that sometimes from such desperation, courage and honor may still be born. Masaki Kobayashi bravely brings the questions of humanity into exposition; in the face of such trials and hardships, can courage, decency and hope still prevail?A raw indictment of its nation's wartime mentality as well as a personal existential tragedy, Kobayashi's riveting, gorgeously filmed epic is novelistic cinema at its best.Highest Possible Recommendation!
