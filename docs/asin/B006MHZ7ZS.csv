1517355,A2ZS7TPOJFCMBN,B006MHZ7ZS,BAILADORA FINA,"[12, 17]","Usually, a good biopic leaves the viewer hungry to explore its subject even further.  At least that has always been my case.  Invariably, I have always gone into deep research whenever my curiosity has been pricked (no pun intended) by a biographical film.  James Franco, darling of The Advocate set, who report on his every move, has single-handedly managed to do exactly the opposite.  His self-indulgent exercise on the life of Hart Crane is so boring, dull, and devoid of life itself, that it leaves you with the feeling of never wanting to hear Crane's name spoken in your presence ever again.  Which, of course, is a disservice to Crane and his work.  Both deserve much better.  This film is a torturous waste of the viewer's time.  We get interminable shots of Franco doing nothing, or barely nothing, like walking the streets aimlessly, juxtaposed with interminable shots of Franco's dull renderings of Crane's poetry, complete with mispronunciations. And let's face it, whatever it is that Star Quality is, Mr. Fanco does not have it.  Marlon Brando could get away with interminable, boring, self-indulgent shots of himself (think Last Tango), but then, he was Marlon Brando.  Mr. Franco is not.  Mr. Franco also doesn't believe in sharing the screen with other actors.  Except for his little brother, who is prominently, if briefly featured at the beginning of the film, we hardly get a close-up of, or a line of dialog from, any other actor in this mess.  Mr. Franco also makes the mistake of writing 21st century dialog and putting it in the mouth of a man who lived from 1899 to 1932, when American English was not what it is today.  This, however, is a commonplace affliction nowadays, where anachronistic dialog is uttered in period pieces (think of the gems that come out of DiCaprio's and Winslet's  little mouths in Titanic)  Writers today seem to be totally unable to come up with erudite dialog representative of the period they are writing about.  In the case of Franco, this is cruelly exposed and highlighted by the juxtaposition of Hart's poetry readings, with the dialog his character speaks in the film.  Hart writes like a poet, in the English of his time, yet he speaks like anyone would today, in modern American parlance.  Totally anachronistic.  Not that Tennessee Williams went around uttering things like ""I have always depended on the kindness of strangers"", but then, I'm certain he didn't use the words bro, or dude either.  Or the infamous ""Don't do this!"", a line which finds its way into 9 out of 10 films and/or TV shows written today.  Who the hell came up with that one?  I have never heard ANYONE in any film of the thirties, forties, fifties, etc. say ""Don't do this!""  Ridiculous!  Also anachronistic is Franco's choice of music.  Considering that Crane died in 1932, I sincerely doubt he ever listened or danced to a Perez-Prado mambo, as Mr. Mambo King was a 16 year old school boy in Matanzas, Cuba at the time of Crane's death.  He didn't come up with his formulaic mambo rhythms until the late forties, when he emigrated to Mexico and became an RCA recording artist.  Noting Mr. Franco's penchant for homosexual biopics, I dread to see what he has done with poor Sal Mineo.  I wonder if Mr. Franco has managed to bore us  to death with Mineo's story, like he's done with Crane's, when Mineo led such a fascinating life.  And, Mr. Franco, do you really think we need to see you actually do a Sevigny?  What is your point?  Would you stab yourself and draw real blood if the character you were playing does?  I think not.  Film is film, not reality.  I suggest you limit your excursions into the art of fellatio to your own private sex tapes.  Though I must admit that both you and La Sevigny share something in common besides giving actual head on film.  Her picture was as crappy and insufferable as yours is.  So much for art, or the art of acting.",1,FRANCOCRAPPOLA,1339804800,"06 16, 2012",2012,3899,"['Usually', 'good', 'biopic', 'viewer', 'hungry', 'explore', 'subject', 'even', 'further', 'least', 'always', 'been', 'case', 'Invariably', 'have', 'always', 'gone', 'deep', 'research', 'whenever', 'curiosity', 'been', 'pricked', 'pun', 'intended', 'biographical', 'film', 'James', 'Franco', 'darling', 'Advocate', 'set', 'who', 'report', 'move', 'single-handedly', 'managed', 'do', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'self-indulgent', 'exercise', 'life', 'Hart', 'Crane', 'so', 'boring', 'dull', 'devoid', 'life', 'feeling', 'never', 'wanting', 'hear', 'Crane', 'name', 'spoken', 'presence', 'ever', 'again', 'Which', 'course', 'disservice', 'Crane', 'work', 'deserve', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'torturous', 'waste', 'viewer', 'time', 'get', 'interminable', 'shots', 'Franco', 'doing', 'nothing', 'barely', 'nothing', 'walking', 'streets', 'aimlessly', 'juxtaposed', 'interminable', 'shots', 'Franco', 'dull', 'renderings', 'Crane', 'poetry', 'complete', 'mispronunciations', 'let', 'face', 'whatever', 'Star', 'Quality', 'Mr.', 'Fanco', 'not', 'have', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'interminable', 'boring', 'self-indulgent', 'shots', 'think', 'Last', 'Tango', 'then', 'was', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Mr.', 'Franco', 'not', 'Mr.', 'Franco', 'also', ""n't"", 'believe', 'sharing', 'screen', 'other', 'actors', 'little', 'brother', 'who', 'prominently', 'briefly', 'featured', 'beginning', 'film', 'hardly', 'get', 'close-up', 'line', 'dialog', 'other', 'actor', 'mess', 'Mr.', 'Franco', 'also', 'mistake', 'writing', '21st', 'century', 'dialog', 'putting', 'mouth', 'man', 'who', 'lived', '1899', '1932', 'when', 'American', 'English', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'today', 'however', 'commonplace', 'affliction', 'nowadays', 'where', 'anachronistic', 'dialog', 'uttered', 'period', 'pieces', 'think', 'gems', 'come', 'DiCaprio', 'Winslet', 'little', 'mouths', 'Titanic', 'Writers', 'today', 'seem', 'be', 'totally', 'unable', 'come', 'up', 'erudite', 'dialog', 'representative', 'period', 'are', 'writing', 'case', 'Franco', 'cruelly', 'exposed', 'highlighted', 'juxtaposition', 'Hart', 'poetry', 'readings', 'dialog', 'character', 'speaks', 'film', 'Hart', 'poet', 'English', 'time', 'yet', 'anyone', 'would', 'today', 'modern', 'American', 'parlance', 'Totally', 'anachronistic', 'Not', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'went', 'uttering', 'things', 'have', 'always', 'depended', 'kindness', 'strangers', 'then', ""'m"", 'certain', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'words', 'bro', 'dude', 'infamous', 'Do', ""n't"", 'do', 'line', 'way', '9', '10', 'films', 'and/or', 'TV', 'shows', 'written', 'today', 'Who', 'hell', 'came', 'up', 'one', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'ANYONE', 'film', 'thirties', 'forties', 'fifties', 'etc', 'say', 'Do', ""n't"", 'do', 'Ridiculous', 'Also', 'anachronistic', 'Franco', 'choice', 'music', 'Considering', 'Crane', 'died', '1932', 'sincerely', 'doubt', 'ever', 'listened', 'danced', 'Perez-Prado', 'mambo', 'Mr.', 'Mambo', 'King', 'was', '16', 'year', 'old', 'school', 'boy', 'Matanzas', 'Cuba', 'time', 'Crane', 'death', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'formulaic', 'mambo', 'rhythms', 'late', 'forties', 'when', 'emigrated', 'Mexico', 'became', 'RCA', 'recording', 'artist', 'Noting', 'Mr.', 'Franco', 'penchant', 'homosexual', 'biopics', 'dread', 'see', 'what', 'done', 'poor', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'wonder', 'Mr.', 'Franco', 'managed', 'bore', 'death', 'Mineo', 'story', 'done', 'Crane', 'when', 'Mineo', 'led', 'fascinating', 'life', 'Mr.', 'Franco', 'do', 'really', 'think', 'need', 'see', 'actually', 'do', 'Sevigny', 'What', 'point', 'Would', 'stab', 'draw', 'real', 'blood', 'character', 'were', 'playing', 'think', 'not', 'Film', 'film', 'not', 'reality', 'suggest', 'limit', 'excursions', 'art', 'fellatio', 'own', 'private', 'sex', 'tapes', 'must', 'admit', 'La', 'Sevigny', 'share', 'something', 'common', 'giving', 'actual', 'head', 'film', 'picture', 'was', 'crappy', 'insufferable', 'yours', 'So', 'much', 'art', 'art', 'acting']",Broken Tower

1517358,A328S9RN3U5M68,B006MHZ7ZS,Grady Harp,"[13, 14]","THE BROKEN TOWER will likely never be on the list of best films made, so why award it five stars? Because this very fine art piece is the result of the devotion of James Franco to his craft.  He worked directly with Boston College professor Paul Mariani, the author of a half dozen volumes of poetry, as well as several biographies of 20th-century American poets, including William Carlos Williams, John Berryman, and Robert Lowell: Franco based THE BROKEN TOWER on Mariani's similarly titled 2000 biography of Crane.The subject of the film is the life and creative genius of Hart Crane, (July 21, 1899 - April 27, 1932) an American poet who found both inspiration and provocation in the poetry of T. S. Eliot, Crane wrote modernist poetry that is difficult, highly stylized, and very ambitious in its scope. In his most ambitious work, The Bridge, Crane sought to write an epic poem in the vein of The Waste Land that expressed something more sincere and optimistic than the ironic despair that Crane found in Eliot's poetry. In the years following his suicide at the age of 32, Crane has come to be seen as one of the most influential poets of his generation.James Franco wrote the screenplay based on book by Paul Mariani, directed and edited the film and acted the main role of Hart Crane.  Crane was a nearly disconsolate man who refused to follow his wealthy father's business, longing instead to be a poet. Born in Ohio he traveled to New York (the place he always considered home), to Cuba, and to Paris searching for his poetic voice.  He was a gay man in an era when his lifestyle was always under threat, he had a lover (Vince Jolivette) early on in an affair that was filled with passion, and in his travels he seemed to find his true love in Emile (Michael Shannon) that endured the manic highs and depressive, death-haunted lows that befell this self -destructive visionary poet. He attempted suicide at least once and finally ended his life in a successful suicide at the young age of 32.Franco breathes life into Hart Crane, offering more understanding of this enigmatic genius than we have ever been afforded.  In making the film Franco uses his younger brother Dave Franco to depict the young Hart and selects his small cast wisely. The film is completely in black and white and is in the format of `Voyages' - each voyage takes us through a distinct part of Hart's life: his gay loves, his poetry readings, his forays to Cuba and to Paris and his lonely hours of sitting before an old typewriter where he created the major epics of poetry that remain some of the finest ever written by an American poet.The film is choppy, not unlike the manner in which Hart's mind worked in bits and pieces, always immersed in thoughts of the sea, the labor of common man, of the Brooklyn Bridge which would play the major role in his most famous epic poem THE BRIDGE, and of the fellow artists whose work he so admired. There is a strange musical score (the work of Neil Benezra) which is long on choral chanting, and a quality of gritty cinematography achieved by Christiana Vorn. The technique of the making of this film matches the vision of James Franco in continuing to visit the lives of isolated geniuses.  The dialogue, what little there is, is Crane's poetry as spoken by Franco.For many this film will seem self-indulgent on Franco's part.  And perhaps it partially is.  But the flavor of this gay American poet of the 1920s and the reflections of America at that time ring true.  THE BROKEN TOWER is not a biopic of Hart Crane.  It is an elegy.

1517359,A3RUMI4Y58S59,B006MHZ7ZS,Heaven's Hound,"[10, 14]","Franco does a superb job as an actor, director and screen-writer. He is courageous in taking on the role of the homosexual poet Hart Crane.  Any actor must be a brave one to choose to play a gay man in our very homophobic America.  Franco seemingly doesn't give a damn about what people think, at least in this regard.  He is an actor and he surely wants roles that will challenge him as an actor.  In this film, he gives a moving performance, mostly by underplaying the role of Crane.  There isn't much dialogue, thus Franco must rely on relaying Crane's feelings and inner life by facial expression and by the artistic use of his eyes.  It is the sign of a gifted actor who can relay a range of emotons simply by his face, a kind of acting that culminated in during the Silent Movies.  Crane loved Charlie Chaplin, even wrote a poem about him.  Franco salutes Chaplin in his minimalistic acting, and by doing so makes Crane, a lost soul, even more endearing.  Franco isn't afriad of silence, and he isn't afraid of sexuality.  There are several highly erotic scenes, ones that most male actors would find very difficult to do, but Franco throwns himself into these scenes, making them real and poignant.  The scene that was particularly moving occurred when Crane was in bed with his lover. Crane was looking out his window at the Brooklyn Bridge, the subject of his most famous poem, and his lover, lying in his lap, looks up at him and says, ""There's nothing like this in the world.""  One could also say there is no poetry in the world like Hart Crane's, and Franco fearlessly includes a goodly portion of it in his film.  If one is to know about Crane, one must become familiar with his poetry, famous for its obscurity.  T.S. Eliot said that poetry can communicate even if it is not understood.  I didn't understand much of The Marriage of Faust and Helen, but I intuitively understood the emotion behind it.  And it was a delight to watch Franco declaim Hart's two poems, the other ""Grandmother's Letters.""  Franco in this scene employed his voice to its fullest advantage.  He has a fine speaking voice, and he was able to use it like a musical instrument, to convey the different emotions of the rather long Faust and Helen poem.  Eleven minutes of poetic declamation is daring in a movie, but he succeeds because he is such a fine actor.  He may have overdone the hand gestures, but other than that it was fine acting and declaiming.  There are so many fine things to notice in this film.  The background music, especially the Latin hymn ""Dona nobis pacem"" underscored Crane's search for peace, a peace he rarely found in his difficult life. The photography was black and white with one scene in color, in a Paris church.  The close-ups of Franco's face were very effective.  In one shot he looked very much like James Dean.  Franco has the intensity of Dean, but I believe he is a more intelligent actor.  Franco's intelligence comes across loud and clear in the bonus feature in which he discusses Crane's life with three professors through a computer.  Franco comes across to this viewer as a humble student, eager to learn from men who have devoted their lives to the study of Crane's life and poetry.  Professor Paul Mariani is superbly articulate, and he seems to understand more deeply what Franco tried to accomplish in his film.  Mariani suggests that Franco's film must be viewed many times, and its main purpose is to bring people to Hart Crane's poetry.  I believe Franco captured the heart of the man and the poet Crane.  His film will, I hope, inspire people to read Hart Crane's poetry.  One should start with his early poetry, which is more accessible.  I always recommend starting with ""Episode of Hands,"" one of the most beautiful poems I've ever read.  I also recommend that Franco's film based on Paul Mariani's book of the same title should go hand-in-hand:  Read Mariani's book first, then watch the movie.  After that, start reading Crane's Collected Poems.  Your life will be enriched.  Crane is a visionary, and he indeed has something important to say about li",5,Franco Captures the Heart of Hart Crane,1333756800,"04 7, 2012",2012,4096,"['Franco', 'superb', 'job', 'actor', 'director', 'screen-writer', 'courageous', 'taking', 'role', 'homosexual', 'poet', 'Hart', 'Crane', 'Any', 'actor', 'must', 'be', 'brave', 'one', 'choose', 'play', 'gay', 'man', 'very', 'homophobic', 'America', 'Franco', 'seemingly', ""n't"", 'give', 'damn', 'what', 'people', 'think', 'least', 'regard', 'actor', 'surely', 'roles', 'will', 'challenge', 'actor', 'film', 'moving', 'performance', 'mostly', 'underplaying', 'role', 'Crane', ""n't"", 'much', 'dialogue', 'thus', 'Franco', 'must', 'rely', 'relaying', 'Crane', 'feelings', 'inner', 'life', 'facial', 'expression', 'artistic', 'use', 'eyes', 'sign', 'gifted', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'relay', 'range', 'emotons', 'simply', 'face', 'kind', 'acting', 'culminated', 'Silent', 'Movies', 'Crane', 'loved', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'even', 'wrote', 'poem', 'Franco', 'Chaplin', 'minimalistic', 'acting', 'doing', 'so', 'Crane', 'lost', 'soul', 'even', 'more', 'endearing', 'Franco', ""n't"", 'afriad', 'silence', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'sexuality', 'are', 'several', 'highly', 'erotic', 'scenes', 'ones', 'most', 'male', 'actors', 'would', 'find', 'very', 'difficult', 'do', 'Franco', 'scenes', 'making', 'real', 'poignant', 'scene', 'was', 'particularly', 'moving', 'occurred', 'when', 'Crane', 'was', 'bed', 'lover', 'Crane', 'was', 'looking', 'out', 'window', 'Brooklyn', 'Bridge', 'subject', 'most', 'famous', 'poem', 'lover', 'lying', 'lap', 'up', 'nothing', 'world', 'One', 'could', 'also', 'say', 'poetry', 'world', 'Hart', 'Crane', 'Franco', 'fearlessly', 'goodly', 'portion', 'film', 'one', 'know', 'Crane', 'one', 'must', 'become', 'familiar', 'poetry', 'famous', 'obscurity', 'T.S', 'Eliot', 'said', 'poetry', 'can', 'communicate', 'even', 'not', 'understood', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'much', 'Marriage', 'Faust', 'Helen', 'intuitively', 'understood', 'emotion', 'was', 'delight', 'watch', 'Franco', 'declaim', 'Hart', 'two', 'poems', 'other', 'Grandmother', 'Letters', 'Franco', 'scene', 'employed', 'voice', 'fullest', 'advantage', 'fine', 'speaking', 'voice', 'was', 'able', 'use', 'musical', 'instrument', 'convey', 'different', 'emotions', 'rather', 'long', 'Faust', 'Helen', 'poem', 'Eleven', 'minutes', 'poetic', 'declamation', 'daring', 'movie', 'such', 'fine', 'actor', 'may', 'have', 'overdone', 'hand', 'gestures', 'other', 'was', 'fine', 'acting', 'declaiming', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'fine', 'things', 'notice', 'film', 'background', 'music', 'especially', 'Latin', 'hymn', 'Dona', 'nobis', 'pacem', 'underscored', 'Crane', 'search', 'peace', 'peace', 'rarely', 'found', 'difficult', 'life', 'photography', 'was', 'black', 'white', 'one', 'scene', 'color', 'Paris', 'church', 'close-ups', 'Franco', 'face', 'were', 'very', 'effective', 'one', 'shot', 'looked', 'very', 'much', 'James', 'Dean', 'Franco', 'intensity', 'Dean', 'believe', 'more', 'intelligent', 'actor', 'Franco', 'intelligence', 'loud', 'clear', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Crane', 'life', 'three', 'professors', 'computer', 'Franco', 'viewer', 'humble', 'student', 'eager', 'learn', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'devoted', 'lives', 'study', 'Crane', 'life', 'poetry', 'Professor', 'Paul', 'Mariani', 'superbly', 'articulate', 'understand', 'more', 'deeply', 'what', 'Franco', 'tried', 'accomplish', 'film', 'Mariani', 'Franco', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'viewed', 'many', 'times', 'main', 'purpose', 'bring', 'people', 'Hart', 'Crane', 'poetry', 'believe', 'Franco', 'captured', 'heart', 'man', 'poet', 'Crane', 'film', 'will', 'hope', 'inspire', 'people', 'read', 'Hart', 'Crane', 'poetry', 'One', 'should', 'start', 'early', 'poetry', 'more', 'accessible', 'always', 'recommend', 'starting', 'Episode', 'Hands', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'poems', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'read', 'also', 'recommend', 'Franco', 'film', 'based', 'Paul', 'Mariani', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'should', 'go', 'hand-in-hand', 'Read', 'Mariani', 'book', 'first', 'then', 'watch', 'movie', 'start', 'reading', 'Crane', 'Collected', 'Poems', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'enriched', 'Crane', 'visionary', 'indeed', 'something', 'important', 'say', 'li']",Broken Tower

Where else would one get a ten minute segment of a poem reading? You have to be able to go with this and not see it as static, but rather as an extremely moving bit of filmmaking. Franco, who wrote, directed and starred in he film, holds up a very real middle finger to those who will see his work as pretentious, even as he wears his heart on his sleeve(No pun intended!)

Martin,"[13, 15]","I must confess that I ordered The Broken Tower for the wrong reason, because I read that James Franco did something in it that gay men do all the time but non-porn actors NEVER do on film, even openly gay actors in flagrantly gay movies. That bit was kind of a bust, but I ended up liking the movie anyway, for less sleazy reasons.I know next to nothing about Hart Crane, and I don't know a lot more after having watched this movie. It's not a biography by any means. My best guess would be that it's James Franco's impression of what Crane was like, and that's what makes it interesting.It's oddly directed, with very many long, handheld, extreme closeups, filmed from about chest-level, of Franco (as Crane) walking the streets of various cities, usually looking up from just under his chin, but sometimes looking at the back of his head. That motif repeats often.At least 70% of the spoken lines in the movie are Franco (always as Crane) reading Crane's poetry: one long scene reciting to an audience in a formal setting, and much poetry read as a sort of narration as various events unfold on screen. This movie definitely is not for people who hate poetry - Crane's poetry in particular.It's definitely not for people who need action, romance, likable characters, or a clear story line in movies. It's for people who can sit through a 108-minute experimental movie without any particular expectation as to what it's going to be like.It's for people who appreciate enthusiasm and passion in artists (I'm talking mainly about Franco, but it applies to Crane too, I suppose) even if the result is not particularly coherent. It's obvious that this was a labor of love for Franco, and that more than anything else is what makes it interesting.",4,James Franco's impression of what Hart Crane was like,1333670400,"04 6, 2012",2012,1743,"['must', 'confess', 'ordered', 'Broken', 'Tower', 'wrong', 'reason', 'read', 'James', 'Franco', 'did', 'something', 'men', 'do', 'time', 'non-porn', 'actors', 'NEVER', 'do', 'film', 'even', 'openly', 'gay', 'actors', 'flagrantly', 'gay', 'movies', 'bit', 'was', 'kind', 'bust', 'ended', 'up', 'liking', 'movie', 'anyway', 'less', 'sleazy', 'reasons.I', 'know', 'next', 'nothing', 'Hart', 'Crane', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'lot', 'more', 'having', 'watched', 'movie', 'not', 'biography', 'means', 'best', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'James', 'Franco', 'impression', 'what', 'Crane', 'was', 'what', 'interesting.It', 'oddly', 'directed', 'very', 'many', 'long', 'handheld', 'extreme', 'closeups', 'filmed', 'chest-level', 'Franco', 'Crane', 'walking', 'streets', 'various', 'cities', 'usually', 'looking', 'up', 'just', 'chin', 'sometimes', 'looking', 'back', 'head', 'motif', 'repeats', 'often.At', 'least', '70', '%', 'spoken', 'lines', 'movie', 'are', 'Franco', 'always', 'Crane', 'reading', 'Crane', 'poetry', 'one', 'long', 'scene', 'reciting', 'audience', 'formal', 'setting', 'much', 'poetry', 'read', 'sort', 'narration', 'various', 'events', 'unfold', 'screen', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'people', 'who', 'hate', 'poetry', 'Crane', 'poetry', 'particular.It', 'definitely', 'not', 'people', 'who', 'need', 'action', 'romance', 'likable', 'characters', 'clear', 'story', 'line', 'movies', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'sit', '108-minute', 'experimental', 'movie', 'particular', 'expectation', 'what', 'going', 'be', 'like.It', 'people', 'who', 'appreciate', 'enthusiasm', 'passion', 'artists', ""'m"", 'talking', 'mainly', 'Franco', 'Crane', 'too', 'suppose', 'even', 'result', 'not', 'particularly', 'coherent', 'obvious', 'was', 'labor', 'love', 'Franco', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'what', 'interesting']",Broken Tower
1517362,A2SIBFTMWJY6ZS,B006MHZ7ZS,John C. Marshell Jr.,"[4, 6]","My trips into the world of poetry are few and selective.  In all honesty, I purchased ""Broken Tower"" as a companion film toHowl. When I purchased ""Howl,"" I half-expected not to like it but came away rather pleased at an artistically satisfying and interesting presentation of the poem by Allen Ginsberg.  The animation I half-dreaded seeing actually enhanced the poem's reading, and James Franco's portrayal of Ginsberg seemed convincing, including his effort to imitate Ginsberg's reading of ""Howl.""  Though I knew ""Broken Tower"" was a student project with a smaller production budget, I had some optimism that it would follow the experience I found in ""Howl,"" but that was simply not the case.  ""Broken Tower"" is a little disappointing.Most poetry experts consider Hart Crane's poems ""difficult.""  They have strong erotic and sensuous components designed to create feeling and emotional effect rather than articulate meaning and self revelation.  Though Crane coined the term ""logic of metaphor"" to explain his poetical striving, it is intellectually obtuse and lacks the clarity of Hopkins' ""inscape"" and Keats' ""negative capability.""  If Franco was trying to make Crane more accessible by putting him into film, I think his efforts largely failed.  Little is done to explain the complexities of Crane's art despite full readings of his works. The visuals can be uninspired, lifeless, and incongruous to the narration.  There is one scene, however, of Crane inside a church shot in color, which gives the film a moment of transcendence, but unless you bear the prejudice of knowing that Crane saw an element of the mystical in his art form, its inclusion abandons the viewer to the world of the simply emotive.  Did Franco do this on purpose in an effort to mime in film what Crane did in print?  The optimist in me yells ""bravo.""  But perhaps Franco should have learned to animate?You never really get a sense of the period (1920's America).  Most scenes are shot close-up, and by the end of the movie, you feel like you have been living in a tunnel for ninety minutes.  Franco relies on a few props and music to convey the era, but you never really feel like you have been transported to a different time.  The bits of Jazz make sense, but the use of an untrained church choir to sing ""Dona nobis pacem"" is baffling (I don't think Crane was Catholic), and by the third time you hear it, annoying.  The use of Ravel's ""Bolero"" (which has a nasty hiccup in its playback) is also mystifying.  Sadly, sound effects are also a little rough.  Sea noises are pretty much just noises.I consider James Franco a good actor.  His portrayal of James Dean (James Dean) was insightful and outstanding.  But he fails to shine in this performance, except for the sex scenes, which of course has everyone gossiping.  Crane considered his sexuality an important part of his art, but Franco never really makes the connection between sex and writing in the film, so the sex scenes become sublimely gratuitous or simply informational--Crane was gay. But the great weakness in Franco's performance is his voice.  Sorry, Franco fans.  Franco, I think, has all the lilt and cadence of a polite truck driver.  Paul Scofield, who's life is now rounded by a small sleep, need not fear a diminishing of his reputation from this quarter of the firmament.  In some ways, Franco's reading of Crane sounded a bit like his reading of Ginsberg, but what worked well in that film, did not translate into ""Broken Tower.""  I could not help but feel a lack of originality in his presentation.There is one strength to this dvd.  The extras contain interviews with Crane scholars.  They were very interesting and informative, and if you purchase this dvd, make sure you see them.",3,"Howling Crane, a Crane a howling",1334361600,"04 14, 2012",2012,3744,"['trips', 'world', 'poetry', 'are', 'few', 'selective', 'honesty', 'purchased', 'Broken', 'Tower', 'companion', 'film', 'toHowl', 'When', 'purchased', 'Howl', 'half-expected', 'not', 'like', 'came', 'away', 'rather', 'pleased', 'artistically', 'satisfying', 'interesting', 'presentation', 'poem', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'animation', 'half-dreaded', 'seeing', 'actually', 'enhanced', 'poem', 'reading', 'James', 'Franco', 'portrayal', 'Ginsberg', 'seemed', 'convincing', 'including', 'effort', 'imitate', 'Ginsberg', 'reading', 'Howl', 'knew', 'Broken', 'Tower', 'was', 'student', 'project', 'smaller', 'production', 'budget', 'had', 'optimism', 'would', 'follow', 'experience', 'found', 'Howl', 'was', 'simply', 'not', 'case', 'Broken', 'Tower', 'little', 'disappointing.Most', 'poetry', 'experts', 'consider', 'Hart', 'Crane', 'poems', 'difficult', 'have', 'strong', 'erotic', 'sensuous', 'components', 'designed', 'create', 'feeling', 'emotional', 'effect', 'rather', 'articulate', 'meaning', 'self', 'revelation', 'Crane', 'coined', 'term', 'logic', 'metaphor', 'explain', 'poetical', 'striving', 'intellectually', 'obtuse', 'clarity', 'Hopkins', 'inscape', 'Keats', 'negative', 'capability', 'Franco', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'Crane', 'more', 'accessible', 'putting', 'film', 'think', 'efforts', 'largely', 'failed', 'Little', 'done', 'explain', 'complexities', 'Crane', 'art', 'full', 'readings', 'works', 'visuals', 'can', 'be', 'uninspired', 'lifeless', 'incongruous', 'narration', 'one', 'scene', 'however', 'Crane', 'church', 'shot', 'color', 'film', 'moment', 'transcendence', 'bear', 'prejudice', 'knowing', 'Crane', 'saw', 'element', 'mystical', 'art', 'form', 'inclusion', 'viewer', 'world', 'simply', 'emotive', 'Did', 'Franco', 'do', 'purpose', 'effort', 'mime', 'film', 'what', 'Crane', 'did', 'print', 'optimist', 'bravo', 'perhaps', 'Franco', 'should', 'have', 'learned', 'animate', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'period', '1920', 'America', 'Most', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'close-up', 'end', 'movie', 'feel', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'tunnel', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'Franco', 'few', 'props', 'music', 'convey', 'era', 'never', 'really', 'feel', 'have', 'been', 'transported', 'different', 'time', 'bits', 'Jazz', 'make', 'sense', 'use', 'untrained', 'church', 'choir', 'sing', 'Dona', 'nobis', 'pacem', 'baffling', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Crane', 'was', 'Catholic', 'third', 'time', 'hear', 'annoying', 'use', 'Ravel', 'Bolero', 'nasty', 'hiccup', 'playback', 'also', 'mystifying', 'Sadly', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'also', 'little', 'rough', 'Sea', 'noises', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'noises.I', 'consider', 'James', 'Franco', 'good', 'actor', 'portrayal', 'James', 'Dean', 'James', 'Dean', 'was', 'insightful', 'outstanding', 'shine', 'performance', 'sex', 'scenes', 'course', 'everyone', 'gossiping', 'Crane', 'considered', 'sexuality', 'important', 'part', 'art', 'Franco', 'never', 'really', 'connection', 'sex', 'writing', 'film', 'sex', 'become', 'sublimely', 'gratuitous', 'simply', 'informational', 'Crane', 'was', 'gay', 'great', 'weakness', 'Franco', 'performance', 'voice', 'Sorry', 'Franco', 'fans', 'Franco', 'think', 'lilt', 'cadence', 'polite', 'truck', 'driver', 'Paul', 'Scofield', 'who', 'life', 'now', 'rounded', 'small', 'sleep', 'need', 'not', 'fear', 'diminishing', 'reputation', 'quarter', 'firmament', 'ways', 'Franco', 'reading', 'Crane', 'sounded', 'bit', 'reading', 'Ginsberg', 'what', 'worked', 'well', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'translate', 'Broken', 'Tower', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'lack', 'originality', 'presentation.There', 'one', 'strength', 'dvd', 'extras', 'contain', 'interviews', 'Crane', 'scholars', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'informative', 'purchase', 'dvd', 'make', 'sure', 'see']",Broken Tower

1517364,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B006MHZ7ZS,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[4, 5]","Hart Crane is one of the earliest poets who is credited with using the words and images in his poems to create an overall meaning to the poem, instead the words have a direct meaning. Director/writer/star James Franco seems to use this same technique to try and build an overall impression of Crane by presenting us with scenes from Crane's life and for the viewer from an idea of Crane as a man and poet. The results while artful are spotty at best and leave all but the most ardent Hart Crane fans wondering what happened.""The Broken Tower"" presents us with scenes from Crane's life that are presented as separate vignettes with no context to link them or give an idea of traditional narrative. The scenes come from a teenage suicide attempt by Crane, his relationship with his father, his homosexual affairs, in his work as a copywriter, in his retreat to work on his poems, readings of his poems, and concluding with his relationship with Peggy Guggenheim.As a director James Franco provides some interesting shots, such as, through the rounded window of the back of a car for a shot of intimacy, and some interesting effects running across the Brooklyn Bridge.The problem lies in that's there's no connection to anything in the movie. Although, Franco presents a lot of Crane's poetry in the movie, we feel no connection to Crane as a poet, or what may have inspired those poems, except perhaps the Brooklyn Bridge which Crane immortalized in his poem, ""The Bridge"". Other aspects of Crane's personality also don't connect you to Crane, the man. We're shown scenes of Crane drinking, drunk, or hung over, but no reason is given or shown to the cause of Crane's angst, although it can inferred it is his homosexuality or even his bad relationship with his father or disintegrating relationship with his mother, but again these connections aren't explicit and only occur to one in hindsight. The overall effect is that unless you came in with a good knowledge of Hart Crane you're unlikely to walk away from this film with any greater knowledge or the bigger loss to Crane, an appreciation for his work.",4,Impressions of a Poet,1333411200,"04 3, 2012",2012,2106,"['Hart', 'Crane', 'one', 'earliest', 'poets', 'who', 'credited', 'using', 'words', 'images', 'poems', 'create', 'overall', 'meaning', 'poem', 'instead', 'words', 'have', 'direct', 'meaning', 'Director/writer/star', 'James', 'Franco', 'use', 'same', 'technique', 'try', 'build', 'overall', 'impression', 'Crane', 'presenting', 'scenes', 'Crane', 'life', 'viewer', 'idea', 'Crane', 'man', 'poet', 'results', 'artful', 'are', 'spotty', 'best', 'leave', 'most', 'ardent', 'Hart', 'Crane', 'fans', 'wondering', 'what', 'happened', 'Broken', 'Tower', 'scenes', 'Crane', 'life', 'are', 'presented', 'separate', 'vignettes', 'context', 'link', 'give', 'idea', 'traditional', 'narrative', 'scenes', 'come', 'teenage', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'Crane', 'relationship', 'father', 'homosexual', 'affairs', 'work', 'copywriter', 'retreat', 'work', 'poems', 'readings', 'poems', 'concluding', 'relationship', 'Peggy', 'Guggenheim.As', 'director', 'James', 'Franco', 'interesting', 'shots', 'such', 'rounded', 'window', 'back', 'car', 'shot', 'intimacy', 'interesting', 'effects', 'running', 'Brooklyn', 'Bridge.The', 'problem', 'connection', 'anything', 'movie', 'Franco', 'lot', 'Crane', 'poetry', 'movie', 'feel', 'connection', 'Crane', 'poet', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'inspired', 'poems', 'perhaps', 'Brooklyn', 'Bridge', 'Crane', 'immortalized', 'poem', 'Bridge', 'Other', 'aspects', 'Crane', 'personality', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'connect', 'Crane', 'man', ""'re"", 'shown', 'scenes', 'Crane', 'drinking', 'drunk', 'hung', 'reason', 'given', 'shown', 'cause', 'Crane', 'angst', 'can', 'inferred', 'homosexuality', 'even', 'bad', 'relationship', 'father', 'disintegrating', 'relationship', 'mother', 'again', 'connections', 'are', ""n't"", 'explicit', 'only', 'occur', 'one', 'hindsight', 'overall', 'effect', 'came', 'good', 'knowledge', 'Hart', 'Crane', ""'re"", 'unlikely', 'walk', 'away', 'film', 'greater', 'knowledge', 'bigger', 'loss', 'Crane', 'appreciation', 'work']",Broken Tower
1517365,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B006MHZ7ZS,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[21, 24]","I am confident that many people who will review James Franco's ""The Broken Tower"" will declare it a cinematic marvel. I am equally sure that its detractors will call it an incomprehensible mess. This self-consciously arty exploration of the life and work of poet Hart Crane seems destined to divide its audience, and I suspect reactions will be intense and passionate. I guess I'll straddle the middle ground somewhat and call ""The Broken Tower"" an interesting experiment. Of course, if you are a fervent Franco fan--you will undoubtedly seek out this project as he is its star, director and writer. Its appeal to others, however, may be considerably more limited. On the one hand, the film's visual aesthetic is undeniably arresting. Franco borrows techniques from many of the masters in developing the film's beautiful black-and-white palette and sets up interesting and unconventional shots. From a technical standpoint, the film has a lot going for it. On the other hand, the film is notably less successful at getting you to understand its subject. This, for me (as someone who is familiar with Hart Crane), may be the movie's fatal undoing.The movie is not concerned with being a traditional biography. It is structured in a series of vignettes (labeled as voyages). Some of these interludes are evocative, some are rather obtuse. With a subject that is so inherently dramatic and tumultuous, it is quite unexpected how little of that drama actually makes it into the story. Many of the segments offer mundane slice-of-life glimpses of Crane, some offer brief outbursts usually without context, and many offer reading after reading of Crane's work and/or letters. I appreciate that Franco wants to honor Crane by using his actual words, but the modernist poems are served in rather inflectionless vocal renderings over stagnant visual imagery. Take, in contrast, the last time Franco embodied a famous poet (Ginsberg in Howl). ""Howl"" made a point of bringing the poetry to life with various stylistic experiments. Here, I never thought that Crane's pieces were allowed to sing.There is no denying that Crane is a fascinating subject, if not a particularly popular one. Committing suicide at age 32 (in 1932), Crane was an idealist, a homosexual, a revolutionary, and a troubled soul. His most ambitious work, The Bridge, is an epic endeavor that is still considered quite influential today. But if you know nothing about Hart Crane, ""The Broken Tower"" does not seek to elucidate its subject matter. Franco is so concerned about stripping down conventional film narrative and story that the viewing experience can be a challenge. He chooses random images (one sex scene, in particular, seems like pure provocation) to make an artful, though emotionally distant, experiment of a film. While I appreciate the gamble (some of which works, some strikes as self-indulgent), it left a void at the center of the film for me. Without knowing Crane, I couldn't really care about him. So even though I admired some of the filmmaking choices, I'm not sure the movie ever fulfilled the promise of its fascinating subject.As I said in the opener, some might decry this a masterpiece and some might call it utter nonsense. For me, the movie ends up being more about Franco trying to define himself as an iconoclastic filmmaker than it does about the actual Hart Crane. For a very specialized audience, I would only recommend ""Broken Tower"" to a select few.

1517366,A3MTUU1VKCGMX4,B006MHZ7ZS,Randall Ross,"[6, 9]","This movie is very boring with long long moments of James Franco walking around the streets looking depressed.  I don't know much more about his character and the subject of this film, Hart Crane, than before I watched it.  James Franco is a good actor, but he needs a lot of help as a screenwriter and director in my opinion.  I've seen a couple of his other short films and they are all mediocre at best.  There is no real narrative for the story, very little dialogue to explain much of anything.  The few moments that there is any story exposition through dialogue and conversations with other characters are the best scenes of the film, I wish there was much more of that. Perhaps there could have been scenes of discussions with other writers or artists about the nature of art or the need to write, to express oneself and interpret the meaning of life and experience.  Instead what much of the film is is James Franco emoting silently while walking aimlessly for long periods in various cities around the world or while sitting in front of a typewriter and staring at a blank page.  We know he's depressed and suicidal, but little is explained about Hart Crane's relationships with various male lovers or his family.  Gay men in the 1920's and 30's were invisible in society and kept very low profiles and were limited to clandestine meetings behind closed doors.  I'm sure that was a very lonely way to live and the film hints at this as one of the reasons for Hart's incredible loneliness and sadness, but since we never get a real conversation between any of his lovers, we are left with a couple of sex scenes and don't know who any of these men passing through Hart's life are.  Watching the film feels more like watching a painting at a museum while wearing a headset listening to Hart Crane's poetry with a single character for 80% of it.  A much superior movie about writers is HOWL also starring James Franco as Allen Ginsberg and the famous poem he wrote.  There is so much more emotion and life in that movie than in Broken Tower, which just feels lifeless and void of emotion to me.  In HOWL during James Franco's reading of the poem throughout the filmmakers did something genius which was to use animated imagery to interpret the poem, which really brought it to life for me and helped me to understand what Ginsberg was trying to express.  In Broken Tower, we just see James Franco reciting in a flat monotone void of any emotion Hart Crane's poetry and it's difficult to understand much of it.
