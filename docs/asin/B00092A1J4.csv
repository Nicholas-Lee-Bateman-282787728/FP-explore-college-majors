Amanda has always been a thief and loves to steal (Think a female It Takes a Thief who can live forever). The problem with most spin off series is they are not as good as the originals, as this project is.Amanda's  foil is Ex-con/security expert Nick Wolfe (The Wolf and the Raven) Nick and Amanda are as a couple act like a weaker Maddy and Dave (from Moonlighting, which one of the producer said they were trying to somewhat achieve with the Raven.)The feature of the anatomy of this series told in hinesight from the cast and the crew is interesting and sometimes TOO MUCH INFORMATION. if you like back stories, these features on all the diskes will enlighten if this is up your alley. It has audio commentary as well.The premise works. The shows of the complete Raven series are here. If you are a fan of the Highlander Canon (the movies, the series, the Raven), its worth its weigh in gold to you.If you are a fan of the one season Raven, as I am-this DVD box set  is a little pricey for its contents, but the film quality is there!Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD",4,Hghlander lite,1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,1196,"['Amanda', 'one', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Highlander', 'season', 'was', 'spun', 'spin', 'series', 'Highlander', 'Raven', 'Amanda', 'always', 'been', 'thief', 'steal', 'Think', 'female', 'Thief', 'who', 'can', 'live', 'forever', 'problem', 'most', 'spin', 'off', 'series', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'originals', 'project', 'is.Amanda', 'foil', 'Ex-con/security', 'expert', 'Nick', 'Wolfe', 'Wolf', 'Raven', 'Nick', 'Amanda', 'are', 'couple', 'act', 'weaker', 'Maddy', 'Dave', 'Moonlighting', 'one', 'producer', 'said', 'were', 'trying', 'somewhat', 'achieve', 'Raven', 'feature', 'anatomy', 'series', 'told', 'hinesight', 'cast', 'crew', 'interesting', 'sometimes', 'TOO', 'MUCH', 'INFORMATION', 'like', 'back', 'stories', 'features', 'diskes', 'will', 'enlighten', 'up', 'alley', 'audio', 'commentary', 'well.The', 'premise', 'works', 'shows', 'complete', 'Raven', 'series', 'are', 'here', 'are', 'fan', 'Highlander', 'Canon', 'movies', 'series', 'Raven', 'worth', 'weigh', 'gold', 'you.If', 'are', 'fan', 'one', 'season', 'Raven', 'am-this', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'little', 'pricey', 'contents', 'film', 'quality', 'there', 'Bennet', 'Pomerantz', 'AUDIOWORLD']",Highlander: The Raven - The Complete Series

It was even worse than I eventually remembered.At the core, the setup is cheesy, there is little chemistry between the stars*, Paul Johansson isn't a very good actor and the immortal mythology is treated as a side-gimmick rather than central to the show (the episodes of Highlander that did this tended to be the worse ones as well.)*The Gracen and Johansson apparently hated each other, which partly explains the lack of chemistry, though bad writing didn't help.It's also quite obvious that the producers lost some of their best writers and production staff.

899999,A3A6GXILVT9JNW,B00092A1J4,Jeanne Tassotto,"[3, 3]","Too bad the series only lasted one season.THE RAVEN picks up the story of Amanda, the popular recurring character from the Highlander series.  Amanda is an immortal and a thief who has been dividing her time most recently between Toronto and Paris (when not dropping into Duncan Macleod's life), engaging in various high thefts to support her highend lifestyle.  As the series opens Amanda crosses paths with Nick Wolfe, a police detective whose life becomes entangled with hers when he discovers her immortality.  Fans of the Highlander franchise will recognize much of the familiar formula, visiting immortals, flashbacks of previous lives, sword fights and Quickenings, that made the Highlander an international hit for 6 seasons.  Sadly THE RAVEN did not last past the first season.Fans of the Highlander series had not been ready to see it end, neither had the series creators so the idea of a spinoff series was born.  Various concepts were tried out and eventually, with much fan enthusiasm, the character of Amanda, the character played by Elizabeth Gracen, who though originally planned for one episode, had become a recurring part of the series.  This spinoff, like the original Highlander series, was to be a syndicated program and an international effort.  Unfortunately the agreements seemed to stop there, along with apparently all communication.The various groups creating this series (Canadian, French and German) all seemed to have different points of view about the direction of the new show.  Canadians wanted another rather dark action adventure much like the first Highlanders series, the Europeans wanted a more light romantic comedy show with even more differences between the French and Germans.  Sadly these issues were only a taste of things to come.In addition to the 22 episodes this set includes four episodes with audio and visual commentaries and multi part feature concerning the problems that plagued the series.  There is an eighth disk, a cd-rom that contains biographies of most of the actors, a triva game, scripts of most of the shows and production notes and storyboards of a couple of the shows.  Fans of the show (and really who else would buy this set?) will probably enjoy these extras also as much as the episodes, if nothing else than to explain why a show that started with such promise ended so badly.",4,She is Immortal.......,1204502400,"03 3, 2008",2008,2348,"['Too', 'bad', 'series', 'only', 'lasted', 'one', 'season.THE', 'RAVEN', 'up', 'story', 'Amanda', 'popular', 'recurring', 'character', 'Highlander', 'series', 'Amanda', 'immortal', 'thief', 'who', 'been', 'dividing', 'time', 'most', 'recently', 'Toronto', 'Paris', 'when', 'not', 'dropping', 'Duncan', 'Macleod', 'life', 'engaging', 'various', 'high', 'thefts', 'support', 'highend', 'lifestyle', 'series', 'Amanda', 'crosses', 'paths', 'Nick', 'Wolfe', 'police', 'detective', 'life', 'entangled', 'hers', 'when', 'immortality', 'Fans', 'Highlander', 'franchise', 'will', 'recognize', 'much', 'familiar', 'formula', 'visiting', 'immortals', 'flashbacks', 'previous', 'lives', 'sword', 'fights', 'Quickenings', 'made', 'Highlander', 'international', 'hit', '6', 'seasons', 'Sadly', 'THE', 'RAVEN', 'did', 'not', 'last', 'first', 'season.Fans', 'Highlander', 'series', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'ready', 'see', 'end', 'had', 'series', 'creators', 'idea', 'spinoff', 'series', 'was', 'born', 'Various', 'concepts', 'were', 'tried', 'eventually', 'much', 'fan', 'enthusiasm', 'character', 'Amanda', 'character', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'Gracen', 'who', 'originally', 'planned', 'one', 'episode', 'had', 'become', 'recurring', 'part', 'series', 'spinoff', 'original', 'Highlander', 'series', 'was', 'be', 'syndicated', 'program', 'international', 'effort', 'Unfortunately', 'agreements', 'seemed', 'stop', 'there', 'apparently', 'communication.The', 'various', 'groups', 'creating', 'series', 'Canadian', 'French', 'German', 'seemed', 'have', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'direction', 'new', 'show', 'Canadians', 'wanted', 'rather', 'dark', 'action', 'adventure', 'much', 'first', 'Highlanders', 'series', 'Europeans', 'wanted', 'more', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'show', 'even', 'more', 'differences', 'French', 'Germans', 'Sadly', 'issues', 'were', 'only', 'taste', 'things', 'come.In', 'addition', '22', 'episodes', 'set', 'four', 'episodes', 'audio', 'visual', 'commentaries', 'multi', 'part', 'feature', 'concerning', 'problems', 'plagued', 'series', 'eighth', 'disk', 'cd-rom', 'biographies', 'most', 'actors', 'triva', 'game', 'scripts', 'most', 'shows', 'production', 'notes', 'storyboards', 'couple', 'shows', 'Fans', 'show', 'really', 'who', 'else', 'would', 'buy', 'set', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'extras', 'also', 'as', 'much', 'episodes', 'nothing', 'else', 'explain', 'why', 'show', 'started', 'such', 'promise', 'ended', 'so', 'badly']",Highlander: The Raven - The Complete Series

900002,A33YGDICCQVSAD,B00092A1J4,"L. Combs ""buddagal""","[1, 1]","I just watched all six seasons of ""Highlander""; and because I enjoyed the Amanda character, I was really looking forward to ""The Raven.""This is a surprisingly mediocre, disappointing series. The production values seem nearly equal to that of the parent show -- so it isn't that. (Although I will say that the music STUNK.)No: The writing is stunningly unimaginative. The dialogue is forced, contrived, positively tortured, as Amanda and Nick do the same adversarial dance through every episode. The tone is repetitiously argumentative, just a plot device, even when there is NOTHING for these two characters to argue about. They might as well have been shouting, ""Have some damn coffee!"" ""OK, I'll have some damn coffee, so what!"" ""Do you want cream and sugar, shut up!""  It was that meaningless.It never rises above the level of Lucy-and-Ricky... except that once in a while, Lucy gets a pouty look on her face and chops someone's head off.It may have been the fault of the writing, or the woeful lack of chemistry between Amanda and Nick -- but the end product makes it seem as though she couldn't carry a leading role, and he couldn't manage the sidekick one. Truthfully, I never thought of Adrian Paul as Oscar-award-winning material, but he MUST have been, to carry Gracen all those years.I'm only half a dozen episodes into the series, and already I find myself wandering away into the kitchen to wash dishes. The storylines are almost unbearably tedious. In some episodes, like ""Crime and Punishment,"" there's barely an immortal element present; Amanda is entirely incidental. It's as though somebody wrote a bad cop shoot-em-up, and then Elizabeth Gracen happened to wander through the set.By the way -- whose decision was Amanda's short white hair?  The show's called ""The Raven,"" right? Wouldn't her (previous) black hair have been more appropriate -- and flattering? Honey -- unless you are Mia Farrow and this is ""Peyton Place,"" short white hair just makes a woman look OLD.And speaking of OLD: Isn't Amanda boasting of an extra 200 years, since the last time we saw her with Duncan? I've heard of women lying about their age to make themselves seem younger... but older??  Also -- what is this ""need a violent death to trigger immortality"" stuff? I may be mistaken, but wasn't Amanda's own original death, from the plague?And don't tell me: Nick's going to turn out to be immortal, right? If I'm wrong, I'll return to this review and admit it. But I suspect that's a cliche that will be irresistible for these writers. They wouldn't want to let beefcake like THAT get old, would they? (The entertainment industry's fondest dream: Handsome, AND lives forever!)What a disappointment this must have been, for all the original ""Highlander"" production people working on it.

This show had potential but it was canceled before it could develop it. Elizabeth Gracen is always excellent. The rest of the cast? Not that great.

The actor who plays Nick Wolfe. Not saying that Elizabeth Gracen isn't a good actress but that I don't like her character. She's an immortal. She cuts off peoples heads for crying out loud. Then she has these little tea time moments. The sense of humor that she has most the time makes it hard to believe she can even get into a serious mode. Paul Johannson on the other hand is an intense actor and he does a really good job with this character.

The idea of combing a &#34;cop&#34; show with the Highlander franchise was just plain lame.

900009,ANM9NWZSNSQ9Q,B00092A1J4,Theresa Flynn,"[62, 72]","Reality fans will love this one - except fans of the Highlander franchise tend to prefer fantasy over reality, so the final verdict is a tad mixed.  Included on each of the eight discs is a ten minute segment of a featurette entitled ""Highlander Confidential:  The Unraveling of a Series"".  Unlike most commentary, where behind-the-scenes conflicts are downplayed or quietly ignored, these interviews are basically a sounding board for the creative forces behind this series to boldly complain about ""what went wrong"".  Blame is abundant and, shotgun-like, hits everyone.  The producers blame the actors, the directors and writers blame the producers, the actors, with well-performed hubris, blame themselves...and others.  So much vitriol is spewed that it could leave a bitter taste for those who enjoyed the series.  Among the reasons given for the series failure are Elizabeth Gracen's hair color, her ""crazy"" boyfriend at the time and the hugely unfortunate timing of the Clinton investigations.  Only David Abramowitz (head writer, listed here as ""Creative Consultant""), in my mind, seems to come close to the truth of the matter.  He correctly states that ""spin-offs rarely succeed"".  He is correct.  I would go further and say that the original series with Adrian Paul had begun to decline in the fifth season and hit the skids in the sixth, so launching a spin-off was probably unwise to begin with.  Given that this show was in syndication, the Panzer-Davis production team had to know that the declining ratings would result in poor timeslots (in my market, one had to search the post-midnight hours to find airings for it).  Lastly, Buffy & Xena aside, going with a female lead in a franchise known for their beefy male ""immortals"" was a critical mistake that cost them a good chunk of the female audience (can anyone say ""Lost opportunity with Peter Wingfield?"")  When all was said and done, the actual show wasn't bad.  Much like the original series, there were some clunky inconsistencies, but overall they did what the fans enjoyed:  Very beautiful people who live a long time making love, spouting philosophy and hacking off heads with pretty swords.  An extra shout-out for the historical flashbacks, always done with great eye and skill, despite the teensy budget.  For Panzer-Davis - take a Midol.  For the very gorgeous Paul Johannson, congrats on ""One Tree Hill"" (oh, for a better vehicle).  And to Elizabeth Gracen - take a cue from your character, Amanda, and get a backbone when it comes to men.",3,Ouch!,1123632000,"08 10, 2005",2005,2520,"['Reality', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'one', 'fans', 'Highlander', 'franchise', 'tend', 'prefer', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'final', 'verdict', 'tad', 'mixed', 'Included', 'eight', 'discs', 'ten', 'minute', 'segment', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'Highlander', 'Confidential', 'Unraveling', 'Series', 'most', 'commentary', 'where', 'behind-the-scenes', 'conflicts', 'are', 'downplayed', 'quietly', 'ignored', 'interviews', 'are', 'basically', 'sounding', 'board', 'creative', 'forces', 'series', 'boldly', 'complain', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'Blame', 'abundant', 'shotgun-like', 'everyone', 'producers', 'blame', 'actors', 'directors', 'writers', 'blame', 'producers', 'actors', 'well-performed', 'hubris', 'blame', 'others', 'So', 'much', 'vitriol', 'spewed', 'could', 'leave', 'bitter', 'taste', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'reasons', 'given', 'series', 'failure', 'are', 'Elizabeth', 'Gracen', 'hair', 'color', 'crazy', 'boyfriend', 'time', 'hugely', 'unfortunate', 'timing', 'Clinton', 'investigations', 'Only', 'David', 'Abramowitz', 'head', 'writer', 'listed', 'here', 'Creative', 'Consultant', 'mind', 'come', 'close', 'truth', 'matter', 'correctly', 'spin-offs', 'rarely', 'succeed', 'correct', 'would', 'go', 'further', 'say', 'original', 'series', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'had', 'begun', 'decline', 'fifth', 'season', 'hit', 'skids', 'sixth', 'so', 'launching', 'spin-off', 'was', 'probably', 'unwise', 'begin', 'Given', 'show', 'was', 'syndication', 'Panzer-Davis', 'production', 'team', 'had', 'know', 'declining', 'ratings', 'would', 'result', 'poor', 'timeslots', 'market', 'one', 'had', 'search', 'post-midnight', 'hours', 'find', 'airings', 'Lastly', 'Buffy', 'Xena', 'aside', 'going', 'female', 'lead', 'franchise', 'known', 'beefy', 'male', 'immortals', 'was', 'critical', 'mistake', 'cost', 'good', 'chunk', 'female', 'audience', 'can', 'anyone', 'say', 'Lost', 'opportunity', 'Peter', 'Wingfield', 'When', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'actual', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Much', 'original', 'series', 'were', 'clunky', 'inconsistencies', 'overall', 'did', 'what', 'fans', 'enjoyed', 'Very', 'beautiful', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'long', 'time', 'making', 'love', 'spouting', 'philosophy', 'hacking', 'off', 'heads', 'pretty', 'swords', 'extra', 'shout-out', 'historical', 'flashbacks', 'always', 'done', 'great', 'eye', 'skill', 'teensy', 'budget', 'Panzer-Davis', 'take', 'Midol', 'very', 'gorgeous', 'Paul', 'Johannson', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'oh', 'better', 'vehicle', 'Elizabeth', 'Gracen', 'take', 'cue', 'character', 'Amanda', 'get', 'backbone', 'when', 'men']",Highlander: The Raven - The Complete Series
