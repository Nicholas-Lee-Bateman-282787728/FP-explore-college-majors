Sliver was also one of the earlier films to highlight a modern day cougar romance as Stone's older character becomes involved with a man, William Baldwin, ten years her junior.Based on the best selling novel by Ira Leving, Sliver was subject to delays and last minute editing which resulted in deleted scenes, a change of identity in the killer and the omission of William Baldwin's full frontal nudity sequence. Sliver is visually stunning. It has a distinctive look, a pulsating score & soundtrack. It has a competent cast with William Baldwin in particular standing out with a charismatic & seductive performance.Sliver could have used another go round with either the script or editing doctor as the story is a bit messy and all over the place. Despite a last minute ending switcharoo, the film's finale is actually quite clever. And despite the last minute editing leaving some story gaps, Sliver still has one of the most fascinating film premises of the 90's.

345061,A3KMTOFTUUNFHG,6302909651,Brett D. Cullum,"[31, 33]","Sharon Stone and SLIVER made a lot of sense after BASIC INSTINCT.  It gave her a chance to be the hunted instead of the hunter, and also promised a whole lot of male nudity this time around instead of her being revealed so much. Eszterhas was back on board as a screenwriter, and the film was designed to be a sexual thriller about modern voyeurism with video cameras.  SLIVER the book was not Ira Levin's best novel (cheesy fun but nothing classic), and I found myself not minding this movie deviates from it.  Anyone who's read it knows the heroine's cat saves the day in one of the silliest climaxes ever.  So don't worry about the book being better or worse with this one.The production ran in to problems especially with the ending originally planned inside a VOLCANO of all things.  Test audiences hated it, and so reshoots were quickly done.  Eszterhas was not happy with the changes to his original script, and some new scenes made the actors seem a little less prepared and rushed.  Billy Baldwin chickened out on full frontal nudity planned for his character, and demanded his most revealing shots be cut from the final movie.  Despite any changes, the movie turns out to be entertaining fluff that never quite seems as kinky as it could be.  It's still a whole lot of fun, and worth it for Stone fans.  There are still some interesting ideas here.This DVD contains a European cut with more nudity and prolonged sex scenes.  For the most part you'll see much more of Baldwin, since Stone carefully handled her nudity this time around (she learned quick after BASIC INSTINCT).  There are no extras, and that's a real shame.  I wanted to see the real ending, but no such luck.  Also no trailers on the disc because they included moments from the original ending and not the new version.  And oddly enough a Lords of Acid song is removed from the DVD's soundtrack.

345063,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6302909651,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[3, 3]","As Carly Norris said: ""You like to watch, watch this!""But seriously, don't watch this, unless you are fascinated by train wrecks, and enjoy seeing a movie spin totally out of control. Joe Eszterhas has recently been born again, after a bout with throat cancer he has given up tobacco, booze, writing trashy but successful scripts, and instead he's taken up the cross. I wish him luck. So far, he has yet to sell any scripts, but he has written a few books. Looking over his oeuvre, there are some successes and some spectacular failures. I'll get to 'Sliver' in a minute, but first a brief recap:'Flashdance' was rather ridiculous in premise, nevertheless, a huge success. 'Jagged Edge' I haven't seen, but from the afterbuzz I sense that it was a taut courtroom drama that may have been ridiculous in premise, but was no doubt entertaining. 'Music Box' may have been the rare Eszterhas film that was both serious, well received by critics and public alike. The story of a daughter who discovers that her father was a Nazi may have resonated for Eszterhas due to personal reasons. 'Basic Instinct' was very trashy, but it worked, even though you knew you were being manipulated, you liked it. Admit it, you did. A guilty pleasure--and Sharon Stone's interrogation scene? It made a big impact. If you have seen it, you remember it, and if you haven't seen it, you've heard about it. 'Showgirls' won several Razzies and is renowned for being one of the worst films of all time. It was supposed to be a box office bomb, but actually it is the highest grossing NC-17 film of all time, probably from DVD sales I would surmise. 'Jade' is notoriously bad. David Caruso quit a lucrative TV career to make this, and his film career went nowhere and he's back on the small screen. Finally, 'An Alan Smithee Film: Burn, Hollywood, Burn' ended Eszterhas' screen writing career. It is ironic, because ""Alan Smithee"" is a name that directors use when they make a movie so bad that they don't want to have their name attached to it, and the film was about a director who made a bad film and didn't want his name attached to it, but his name actually was Alan Smithee, so he did not have that option. Further irony is piled on by the fact that ""Alan Smithee"" as a pseudonym was retired after this movie because the name became too well known, so it was no longer effective as a subterfuge when trying to duck responsibility for a project gone wrong. Like the film within a film, 'An Alan Smithee film: Burn, Hollywood, Burn' itself was also a disaster, and Eszterhas' career took a nosedive. No more multi million dollars for ideas he pitched at lunch or scribbled on a napkin.Which brings us to 'Sliver,' another disaster. Nothing left but to dissect the cadaver. Based on a book by Ira Levin, who also wrote Rosemary's Baby, The Boys from Brazil, and The Stepford Wives, Ira was reluctant to sell the film rights because Hollywood always trampled on his dreams. The one exception was Rosemary's Baby, which was directed by Roman Polanski. Producer Robert Evans sent Ira a book by Polanski with the passages where he (Evans) had saved the project highlighted, and this convinced him to let Evans produce 'Sliver.' Unfortunately, Polanski was forced to leave the country, and though at first they planned to film a few exterior shots in New York and have Roman finish it up in Paris; it ended up being directed by Philip Noyce. Though he was no Polanski, Noyce was no hack, as proved by 'The Quiet American;' but he was unable to salvage 'Sliver.'For a movie with such a titillating premise, 'Sliver' managed to extract all the juice. For a movie about high tech voyeurism, it sure managed to turn down the heat. Though 'Basic Instinct' was trashy, it was much more fun. In 'Instinct' there is a kind of cat and mouse, love/hate thing going with Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas. She is a murder suspect/novelist, and he is the cop investigating her. Talk about good cop, bad cop, he is a very bad cop. He shoots tourists, and has numerous bad habits. Stone plays him like a Stradivarius, pushing his buttons, making him dance to her tune, and all the while, he thinks he is in control. Total trash, but the audience, like Douglas, is also played like a Stradivarius. The Sharon Stone of 'Sliver' has no chemistry with either Tom Berenger or William Baldwin.'Sliver' doesn't deliver on any of its promises, and it squanders its titillating premise. It also botches the ending, because focus groups found the first ending incomprehensible. Eszterhas wrote five new endings in three days, but the one they picked changed the killer and tried to make sense of the botched attempt, and failed again. It makes no sense. Don't want to spoil it by revealing the ending, but it would be hard to spoil it any more than the writer, director, producer, and actors have already. Neither Ira Levin, Joe Eszterhas, the critics, film audiences, nor Tom Berenger were pleased with the result. I tend to agree with them.Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn(1998) (written by Joe Eszterhas)Jade(1995) (written by Joe Eszterhas)Showgirls(1995) (written by Joe Eszterhas)Basic Instinct(1992) (written by Joe Eszterhas, and Sharon Stone was Catherine Tramell)Music Box(1989) (written by Joe Eszterhas)Jagged Edge(1985) (written by Joe Eszterhas)Flashdance(1983) (screenplay by Joe Eszterhas)Looking for Mr. Goodbar(1977) ....

As she begins a heated sexual relationship with a younger neighbor, she's blissfully unaware of the hidden cameras spying on her in her apartment.I don't know how he did it, but director Philip Noyce managed to drain the story of all its suspense and tension. Sliver should've been great. Based on a page-turning novel by Ira Levin, scripted by Joe Eszterhas at the height of his power (although Sliver marks the beginning of his spiralling downfall). But Sliver fails on almost every level. It's slow and dull where it should be mysterious and enticing, and all adaptations are made for the worse. A key element to the plot is reduced to a footnote in the movie. A big confusing mess, the film goes off in every direction and yet never really goes anywhere.The novel is a cynical exploration on the seductive lure of voyerism, but the film chickens out, opting instead for making a moral judgement on the subject matter - Moral ambiguity is always more interesting.The performances are for the most part pretty descent. Sharon Stone is engaging as the heroine, and William Baldwin convinces as the mysterious and charming neighbor, although Levin's charachters suffer at the hands of the filmmakers.There is some style on display here. The film looks great. The production design by Paul Sylbert is excellent, and is superbly highlighted by Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography, creating the perfect atmosphere.

345070,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6302909651,Dennis Littrell,"[1, 1]","Sexually inactive book editor Carly Norris (Sharon Stone) gets a new apartment in a Manhattan high rise before learning that the previous tenant went over the railing to her death.  She does a little microfiche sleuthing and finds that other tenants have met untimely ends.  Seems that evil is aloft.  Meanwhile she meets two guys intent on releasing her from the sexual doldrums, one a best selling macho writer (Tom Berenger), the other a pretty boy with charm (William Baldwin).  Somebody mysteriously gives her a telescope so she can check the action through the windows of the high rises around town. Seems strange.  Meanwhile we are flashed shots of the tenants as though caught on video tape.  Stone opts for Baldwin who seduces her. (I have some comments on THAT, but we'll skip them here.)  Afterward it is revealed that he owns the apartment and has set up surveillance cameras in the walls to spy on the inhabitants.I forget what this is ripped off from-maybe Crawlspace (1986)-but believe it or not, there was a man in Alaska a few years back who actually did this sort of spying on a modest scale.  He had a four-plex or the like with peep holes in the bathroom, etc.  It was on the news.  Here we have high tech spying from a full-blown &quot;war room&quot; with monitors along the wall and an easy chair.  Charming boy Baldwin truly likes to watch.The main problem with this film is the source material.  Ira Levin, who penned the novel, never presumed to literature while managing a very successful career shocking the book club set with such made-into-movie hits as Rosemary's Baby and The Stepford Wives.  His first success, and perhaps the only genuine book he ever published, was No Time for Sergeants from the fifties.  The other novels suffer from flashy fake premises that lead to psychological waters never fully navigated.  In Sliver what is not engaged is the character of a man who would choose to spy on his neighbors as a way of life.  It is like throwing him into a grab bag to make him into your standard issue psycho killer.  As such he is left unexplored.A secondary problem is Phillip Noyce's uninspired and underdeveloped direction.  We can see, even without reading the novel, that heroine Carly Norris was a somewhat frumpy, sexually fallow woman headed straight for matronhood.  If only they had had the guts to play her full out like that.  But Stone seemed ill at ease in such an unfamiliar role and Noyce couldn't be bothered with nuances.  A tertiary problem is the casting of Stone in the first place.  It might be said that Miss Stone, with her on-screen rapacious sexual appetite and her success at any cost cinematic persona, is truly a woman for the `nineties.  (If so, it makes me long for the woman of the `oughts.)  At her best Stone is a professional without charm, but unless she is cast as a ..., evil, predatory female, she just doesn't cut it at all.  In the war room she reverts partially to her usual persona as she goes along with Baldwin's sick program, and she comes to life.  Here we glimpse what might have been done with the premise: the surveillance cameras strip away all privacy and for a moment the man who welds them is exposed as a Nazi-like monster, while she is confronted with her own compromised nature.A final problem is the ending.  Too bad I can't discuss it here.  I will say she tells &quot;charming boy&quot; to &quot;Get a life.&quot;  That's quote, unquote.  That seems a little understated.  Perhaps Noyce was aiming for bathos.",3,Underdeveloped,976406400,"12 10, 2000",2000,3510,"['Sexually', 'inactive', 'book', 'editor', 'Carly', 'Norris', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'new', 'apartment', 'Manhattan', 'high', 'rise', 'learning', 'previous', 'tenant', 'went', 'railing', 'death', 'little', 'microfiche', 'sleuthing', 'finds', 'other', 'tenants', 'have', 'met', 'untimely', 'evil', 'aloft', 'Meanwhile', 'two', 'guys', 'intent', 'releasing', 'sexual', 'doldrums', 'one', 'best', 'selling', 'macho', 'writer', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'other', 'pretty', 'boy', 'charm', 'William', 'Baldwin', 'Somebody', 'mysteriously', 'telescope', 'can', 'check', 'action', 'windows', 'high', 'rises', 'town', 'Seems', 'strange', 'Meanwhile', 'are', 'flashed', 'shots', 'tenants', 'caught', 'video', 'tape', 'Stone', 'Baldwin', 'who', 'have', 'comments', ""'ll"", 'skip', 'here', 'revealed', 'apartment', 'set', 'up', 'surveillance', 'cameras', 'walls', 'spy', 'inhabitants.I', 'forget', 'what', 'ripped', 'from-maybe', 'Crawlspace', '1986', '-but', 'believe', 'not', 'was', 'man', 'Alaska', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'who', 'actually', 'did', 'sort', 'spying', 'modest', 'scale', 'had', 'four-plex', 'like', 'peep', 'holes', 'bathroom', 'etc', 'was', 'news', 'Here', 'have', 'high', 'tech', 'spying', 'full-blown', 'quot', 'war', 'room', 'quot', 'monitors', 'wall', 'easy', 'chair', 'Charming', 'boy', 'Baldwin', 'truly', 'watch.The', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'source', 'material', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'who', 'penned', 'novel', 'never', 'presumed', 'literature', 'managing', 'very', 'successful', 'career', 'shocking', 'book', 'club', 'set', 'such', 'made-into-movie', 'hits', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'first', 'success', 'perhaps', 'only', 'genuine', 'book', 'ever', 'published', 'was', 'Time', 'Sergeants', 'fifties', 'other', 'novels', 'suffer', 'flashy', 'fake', 'premises', 'lead', 'psychological', 'waters', 'never', 'fully', 'navigated', 'Sliver', 'what', 'not', 'engaged', 'character', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'choose', 'spy', 'neighbors', 'way', 'life', 'throwing', 'grab', 'bag', 'make', 'standard', 'issue', 'psycho', 'killer', 'such', 'left', 'unexplored.A', 'secondary', 'problem', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'uninspired', 'underdeveloped', 'direction', 'can', 'see', 'even', 'reading', 'novel', 'heroine', 'Carly', 'Norris', 'was', 'somewhat', 'frumpy', 'sexually', 'fallow', 'woman', 'headed', 'straight', 'matronhood', 'only', 'had', 'had', 'guts', 'play', 'full', 'Stone', 'seemed', 'ill', 'ease', 'such', 'unfamiliar', 'role', 'Noyce', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'nuances', 'tertiary', 'problem', 'casting', 'Stone', 'first', 'place', 'might', 'be', 'said', 'Miss', 'Stone', 'on-screen', 'rapacious', 'sexual', 'appetite', 'success', 'cost', 'cinematic', 'persona', 'truly', 'woman', 'nineties', 'so', 'long', 'woman', 'oughts', 'best', 'Stone', 'professional', 'charm', 'cast', 'evil', 'predatory', 'female', 'just', ""n't"", 'cut', 'war', 'room', 'partially', 'usual', 'persona', 'along', 'Baldwin', 'sick', 'program', 'life', 'Here', 'glimpse', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'premise', 'surveillance', 'cameras', 'strip', 'away', 'privacy', 'moment', 'man', 'who', 'exposed', 'Nazi-like', 'monster', 'confronted', 'own', 'compromised', 'nature.A', 'final', 'problem', 'ending', 'Too', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'here', 'will', 'say', 'quot', 'charming', 'boy', 'quot', 'quot', 'Get', 'life.', 'quot', 'quote', 'unquote', 'little', 'understated', 'Perhaps', 'Noyce', 'was', 'aiming', 'bathos']",N/A

When you choose a Sharon Stone movie from the shelf, you probably aren't looking for a pretentious ""message"" picture. You are looking for entertainment, full of glamour, thrills, sex, romance, melodrama, and excitement--and that's just where the priorities are in this film.It is not a dumb film. The script is well-written, the cinematography was ahead of its time, and the direction is expert. Sharon Stone is at her best as the vulnerable and lonely Carly, and gives a deep, knowing performance, but the supporting cast varies in ability. Nina Foch and Martin Landau are wasted in small roles.Many complaints concern the ending--which is apparently not true to Ira Levin's novel. Most book-to-screen adaptations are easy to find fault with when comparing to the book. As a viewer who has not read the book, the film is effective, and that is all that really matters!  The film holds its own, and is its own piece of art.And art this really is--the soundtrack, including the score by Howard Shore, is tremendously effective in maintaining the eerie, lonely mood of the film.  The glossy, luxurious atmosphere is also an asset.It's surprising now to read so many negative reviews, because as far as film-making is concerned, SLIVER is not a B-movie at all. It is a very classy affair. It should not be looked at as camp or cheese, because its intentions were not to be a serious message film. It aims to be what it is--an entertaining star vehicle for Sharon Stone at the height of her beauty and stardom!It really should not be surprising, though, that SLIVER is often ridiculed as a ""bad"" film, when our society seems to think the only films worth watching are pretentious message films (not that messages are always bad; BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN contained a very relevant and necessary message, but some films just tell messages for the sake of it, and that is the nature of camp, in my opinion).It also should not be surprising that SLIVER is so hated, considering the conservative nature of much of American society! SLIVER is a film which includes a lot of sex, nudity, and other sophisticated situations which imply ""sin."" Puritans will surely find something to dislike here!  I think in the early 1990s, a lot of people went to movies like BASIC INSTINCT and INDECENT PROPOSAL, enjoyed them, and then bashed them later on because they were ashamed to say they liked such a film. The truth is they were daring, intelligent films which do not deserve their negative reputation. SLIVER is among them!So, I am proud to be an exception, and say that SLIVER is a thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining, and well-made film!  It certainly is a piece of art, and if you are looking for a message, you might just find it has something to say about voyeurism, as well as sexual and romantic independence.",5,Has moments of brilliance; an effective thriller!,1143504000,"03 28, 2006",2006,3014,"['verge', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 're-evaluation', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'film', 'career', 'order.Looking', 'reviews', 'apparent', 'SLIVER', 'not', 'necessarily', 'acclaimed', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'discourage', 'When', 'choose', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'movie', 'shelf', 'probably', 'are', ""n't"", 'looking', 'pretentious', 'message', 'picture', 'are', 'looking', 'entertainment', 'full', 'glamour', 'thrills', 'sex', 'romance', 'melodrama', 'excitement', 'just', 'where', 'priorities', 'are', 'film.It', 'not', 'dumb', 'film', 'script', 'well-written', 'cinematography', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'direction', 'expert', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'best', 'vulnerable', 'lonely', 'Carly', 'deep', 'knowing', 'performance', 'supporting', 'cast', 'varies', 'ability', 'Nina', 'Foch', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'are', 'wasted', 'small', 'roles.Many', 'complaints', 'concern', 'ending', 'apparently', 'not', 'true', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'novel', 'Most', 'book-to-screen', 'adaptations', 'are', 'easy', 'find', 'fault', 'when', 'comparing', 'book', 'viewer', 'who', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'film', 'effective', 'really', 'film', 'own', 'own', 'piece', 'art.And', 'art', 'really', 'soundtrack', 'including', 'score', 'Howard', 'Shore', 'tremendously', 'effective', 'maintaining', 'eerie', 'lonely', 'mood', 'film', 'glossy', 'luxurious', 'atmosphere', 'also', 'asset.It', 'surprising', 'now', 'read', 'so', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'as', 'far', 'film-making', 'concerned', 'SLIVER', 'not', 'B-movie', 'very', 'classy', 'affair', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'looked', 'camp', 'cheese', 'intentions', 'were', 'not', 'be', 'serious', 'message', 'film', 'be', 'what', 'entertaining', 'star', 'vehicle', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'height', 'beauty', 'stardom', 'really', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'surprising', 'though', 'SLIVER', 'often', 'ridiculed', 'bad', 'film', 'when', 'society', 'think', 'only', 'films', 'watching', 'are', 'pretentious', 'message', 'films', 'not', 'messages', 'are', 'always', 'bad', 'BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'contained', 'very', 'relevant', 'necessary', 'message', 'films', 'just', 'tell', 'messages', 'sake', 'nature', 'camp', 'opinion', '.It', 'also', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'surprising', 'SLIVER', 'so', 'hated', 'considering', 'conservative', 'nature', 'much', 'American', 'society', 'SLIVER', 'film', 'lot', 'sex', 'nudity', 'other', 'sophisticated', 'situations', 'imply', 'sin', 'Puritans', 'will', 'surely', 'find', 'something', 'dislike', 'here', 'think', 'early', '1990s', 'lot', 'people', 'went', 'movies', 'BASIC', 'INSTINCT', 'INDECENT', 'PROPOSAL', 'enjoyed', 'then', 'bashed', 'later', 'were', 'ashamed', 'say', 'liked', 'film', 'truth', 'were', 'daring', 'intelligent', 'films', 'do', 'not', 'deserve', 'negative', 'reputation', 'SLIVER', 'So', 'am', 'proud', 'be', 'exception', 'say', 'SLIVER', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'well-made', 'film', 'certainly', 'piece', 'art', 'are', 'looking', 'message', 'might', 'just', 'find', 'something', 'say', 'voyeurism', 'as', 'well', 'sexual', 'romantic', 'independence']",N/A

One critic did enjoy the film, however; David Sheehan from NBC says, ""Don't miss it! Goes beyond ""Basic Instinct""...super, sexy, super-stylish, super suspenseful.""",5,"""Sexy and Stylish""",1254787200,"10 6, 2009",2009,1103,"['Probably', 'one', 'biggest', 'critical', 'failures', 'history', 'motion', 'pictures', 'Sliver', 'centers', 'woman', 'played', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'who', 'highrise', 'apartment', 'downtown', 'Manhattan', 'when', 'suddenly', 'many', 'tenants', 'start', 'get', 'murdered', 'owner', 'buliding', 'played', 'William', 'Baldwin', 'voyeuism', 'videotaping', 'goings', 'tenant', 'apartments', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'forgotten', 'today', 'many', 'do', 'remember', 'film', 'extreme', 'amount', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Stone', 'Baldwin', 'as', 'well', 'amount', 'male', 'nudity', 'Baldwin', 'original', 'cut', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'frontal', 'shot', 'body', 'film', 'pretty', 'empty', 'plot', 'buy', 'film', 'want', 'see', 'gorgeous', 'body', 'William', 'Baldwin', 'not', 'shy', 'showing', 'assets', 'critical', 'failure', 'movie', 'Sliver', 'grossed', '166,000,000', 'boxoffice', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'widescreen', 'One', 'critic', 'did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'however', 'David', 'Sheehan', 'NBC', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'super', 'sexy', 'super-stylish', 'super', 'suspenseful']",N/A

Sliver is a dark,  moody piece of cinema.  The score is also dark and very haunting.  One song  that is played throughtout the film is &quot;Carly's Song&quot; by enigma.  This sets the pace for the film, where Carly moves into a daunting,  mysterious apartment complex with a shady history. There she is being  watched just like all the other unassuming tennants.  The million dollar  questionis, WHO is the culprit?  Exactly WHO is doing the watching.  It is  a voyeurs wet dream this movie is.What I enjoyed most about this film  is the dreariness of the way it was filmed, and of course the eerie music  to go along with it. Only ignorant people can't look past the sex and nudity.  It  is also a compelling tale of a loser who gets his rocks off by watching  other people's lives like he is watching a soap opera.  He does this by  installing hidden video cameras in all the rooms of the apartment  building.......creepy, very very creepy.Sharon Stone shines here, in a  very underrated thriller.
