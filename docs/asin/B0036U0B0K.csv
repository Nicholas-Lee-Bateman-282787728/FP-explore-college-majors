1329199,A2Z65D8FBYDY63,B0036U0B0K,Donald J. Wurzelbacher,"[7, 7]","I've always been a big fan of the Honeymooners. I am very happy that MPI is releasing these specials now that they have finished the 1960s color Honeymooners musicals. It is a treat to see Jackie Gleason, Art Carson and Audrey Meadows together again, particuarly Audrey Meadows. Jane Kean is a fine Trixie but I would have really enjoyed seeing Joyce Randolf again. Anyway, these specials were made in the early 70s and it's obvious that the cast has grown a little older. The jokes and storylines seemed to mostly be coming from some older ""lost episode"" storylines since at the time nobody thought they'd ever be rebroadcast again or put on something called a DVD. So the 70s audience would probably not remember that many of the things in this story had been done before. Anyway, it was still great to see the cast. The only problem is that I do think it's expensive to purchase just this one DVD that only has a 50 minute show. I will continue to purchase all of these specials but I wish they could have just put all four of them together in one collection for a decent price rather than separating them. And the ""bonus"" material wasn't really worth watching at all. So I give it 3 stars.",3,Nice to see most of the gang again,1275004800,"05 28, 2010",2010,1193,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Honeymooners', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'MPI', 'releasing', 'specials', 'now', 'have', 'finished', '1960s', 'color', 'Honeymooners', 'musicals', 'treat', 'see', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'Art', 'Carson', 'Audrey', 'Meadows', 'together', 'again', 'particuarly', 'Audrey', 'Meadows', 'Jane', 'Kean', 'fine', 'Trixie', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Joyce', 'Randolf', 'again', 'Anyway', 'specials', 'were', 'made', 'early', '70s', 'obvious', 'cast', 'grown', 'little', 'older', 'jokes', 'storylines', 'seemed', 'mostly', 'be', 'coming', 'older', 'lost', 'episode', 'storylines', 'time', 'nobody', 'thought', ""'d"", 'ever', 'be', 'rebroadcast', 'again', 'put', 'something', 'called', 'DVD', '70s', 'audience', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'remember', 'many', 'things', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'Anyway', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'see', 'cast', 'only', 'problem', 'do', 'think', 'expensive', 'purchase', 'just', 'one', 'DVD', 'only', '50', 'minute', 'show', 'will', 'continue', 'purchase', 'specials', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'put', 'four', 'together', 'one', 'collection', 'decent', 'price', 'rather', 'separating', 'bonus', 'material', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'give', '3', 'stars']",The Honeymooners: Second Honeymoon

Wiegand ""dream writer""","[2, 2]","In the mid to late 70's, Jackie Gleason revived The Honeymooners in a series of specials with Audrey Meadows as Alice, Art Carney as Ed Norton, and Jane Kean as Trixie.  This special proves that the intervening years had done nothing to diminish the chemistry between Jackie and Audrey, or between Jackie and Art.  Gleason assumes the role of Ralph Kramden as if he'd never left it, and manages to keep the franchise alive and contemporary (for its time) with a few topical references, yet retaining the flavor of the original Honeymooners sketches of the 1950's.  Once again, Ralph suspects that Alice is pregnant.  Never mind the fact that their ages by the late 70's tend to stretch the plausibility of this premise...with Ralph and Alice, anything seems possible, including their timelessness and agelessness. This is a pleasant, hilarious revival of a comedy classic, sure to appeal to those old enough to remember the originals as well as those so young that this is all new stuff.

1329205,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B0036U0B0K,Robert Badgley,"[10, 10]","Despite what the blurbs say about four TV specials and all in 1976,there were only three that I know of and they are this one,The Second Honeymoon,telecast on Feb./76,the second a Christmas Special broadcast in Dec/77 and the last,The Valentines Special broadcast in Feb/78.Like the others that would follow,The Second Honeymoon was broadcast not from Miami Beach,Fla. but from Miami at Gusman Hall and for ABC not CBS.It was the US's Bi-Centennial and it was also the 25th anniversary of the Honeymooners which was a perfect time for the Great One to return to the airwaves.Back in their seats are Art Carney as Norton,Audrey Meadows as Alice,Jane Kean as Trixie and of course Jackie as Ralph;and it is like they never left the airwaves.Ralph discovers some knitted mitts and a cover for his bowling ball that Alice has tried to hide as gifts for their anniversary,but which he mistakes as baby clothing that she is knitting for someone or other.When Mrs.Manicotti's boy drops buy with news for Alice that a rabbit has died,he puts two and two together to get three and thinks Alice is pregnant.A rabbit really HAS died but not the kind Ralph thinks...of course.Throughout there are the usual miscues as Ralph's ideas take on a life of their own.During all this the Raccoon lodge high exalted ruler has offered to marry them in a grand ceremony and send them off for a 2nd honeymoon to the Raccoon National Cemetery in Bismarck,North Dakota;on the European Plan.After the ceremony Ralph gets embarrassed in front of his fellow members when Alice reveals she is not pregnant.Back home he apologizes but Alice comes back with""...but there's no reason we still can't try"".As Ralph turns around to head for the boudoir,with Alice in tow,he confronts his mother in law...face to face.Alice forgot she had invited her to stay.But in the end all is forgiven and they embrace.This show was a huge success in the ratings which is why ABC invited Gleason back for two more sequels.As I said the cast look like they never had left the series at all.Meadows is a welcome return in her role as Alice and Kean plays her part in a much more relaxed and pleasing way than during her hiatus opposite Sheila Macrae.Carney of course is as always the Laurel to Ralph's Hardy,and both have an uncanny chemistry seldom equaled on television or in film.This DVD runs at 50 minutes and UNFORTUNATELY excludes the opening Gleason monologue and closing goodbyes.But it does include an interesting bonus feature.It is a TV clip from The Hollywood Palace show of Jan.7/67.It is Ray Bolger(the scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz)and Audrey Meadows playing The Honeymooners in a role reversal.Interesting to see but nothing more.This DVD The Second Honeymoon,is an absolute delight and will more than satisfy all fans of the Great One and the Honeymooners.It is a must have.The big question is will MPI release the Christmas Special?I think they will...around Christmas this year,but let's wait and see.",5,Gleason returns for the first of THREE 70's TV specials,1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,2971,"['what', 'blurbs', 'say', 'four', 'TV',
