As compared to recent releases such as Spring Break and Pledge this, this movie gets an oscar for best picture.  This follow Jon Bon Jovi as Frank, a down and out invetor/thinker who gave up a life as a lawyer to pursue a career in promotion and sales.  When he thinks he's lost it all, filling out a simple survey brings new fortune and potential fame his way, along with changing the lives of many others for the better.  David Faustino (Married with Children) is co star as Franks best friend, and unlikely legal consultant when the bubble gets busted.

Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[3, 15]","This is yet another example of why it's just about always a bad idea for NATIONAL LAMPOON to give pseudo-celebrities their chance to take a lead role in one of their films.  Paris Hilton bombed in BOTTOMS UP and Michael Douglas' son had a career-ending flick in ADAM AND EVE.  The present film, with John Bon Jovi, belongs in this same infamous league of NL flops.It becomes painfully obvious from watching this movie that John Bon Jovi can't act - not even just for an NL movie.  [Of course, he can't sing either, but that's another story altogether]  He has no screen presence @ all and mouths his lines as though he is reading off of cue cards (which he probably is).  Not ever, ever, EVER seeing Bon Jovi in another movie again would be a very good thing in my book.The plot is pretty simple.  Bon Jovi plays a con artist who tries to get a women's hockey league going.  The ""catch"" is that the women all look like Victoria's Secret models (with the exception of 1 girl).  As he doesn't have the resources to finance such a venture, he uses ENRON techniques of book-keeping to keep his mis-guided ""dream"" alive.Being that this is an NL film, one would think that there would be a lot of opportunity for some locker room scenes.  Inexplicably, they don't really take advantage of this.  Sure, there are a few flashes of nudity here & there, but if you blink you will miss them.  This aspect of the movie was VERY disappointing.  I've seen some NL movies in the past that were lame but were redeemed by the amount of T & A they had.Along those lines, the only thing that remotely saves this DVD is the special feature.  It's as though the producers say ""We know that you (the viewer) wanted to see topless women.""  {Question:  why didn't they put more in the movie then?}  At any rate, they have some funny ""topless interviews"" with girls from the film - even though the questions are very lame.  They also have some locker room scenes that we were all expecting to see in the movie itself.  Guess that it's better to have it in the Special Features than nowhere @ all.I can't recall ever saying that a DVD's special features were better than the movie itself, but that is the case here.  NL has put out some of the very best party movies of all time (VAN WILDER, VACATION, ANIMAL HOUSE to name a few).  Unfortunately, this one is not one of them.  In fact, it's not even close!",1,Pucked up,1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,2380,"['yet', 'example', 'why', 'just', 'about', 'always', 'bad', 'idea', 'NATIONAL', 'LAMPOON', 'give', 'pseudo-celebrities', 'chance', 'take', 'lead', 'role', 'one', 'films', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'bombed', 'BOTTOMS', 'UP', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'son', 'had', 'career-ending', 'flick', 'ADAM', 'AND', 'EVE', 'present', 'film', 'John', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'same', 'infamous', 'league', 'NL', 'flops.It', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'watching', 'movie', 'John', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'not', 'even', 'just', 'NL', 'movie', '[', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'either', 'story', 'altogether', ']', 'screen', 'presence', '@', 'mouths', 'lines', 'reading', 'cue', 'cards', 'probably', 'Not', 'ever', 'ever', 'EVER', 'seeing', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'movie', 'again', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'thing', 'book.The', 'plot', 'pretty', 'simple', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'con', 'artist', 'who', 'get', 'women', 'hockey', 'league', 'going', 'catch', 'women', 'look', 'Victoria', 'Secret', 'models', 'exception', '1', 'girl', ""n't"", 'have', 'resources', 'finance', 'such', 'venture', 'ENRON', 'techniques', 'book-keeping', 'keep', 'mis-guided', 'dream', 'alive.Being', 'NL', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'opportunity', 'locker', 'room', 'scenes', 'Inexplicably', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'take', 'advantage', 'Sure', 'are', 'few', 'flashes', 'nudity', 'here', 'there', 'blink', 'will', 'miss', 'aspect', 'movie', 'was', 'VERY', 'disappointing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'NL', 'movies', 'past', 'were', 'lame', 'were', 'redeemed', 'amount', 'T', 'A', 'had.Along', 'lines', 'only', 'thing', 'remotely', 'DVD', 'special', 'feature', 'producers', 'say', 'know', 'viewer', 'wanted', 'see', 'topless', 'women', 'Question', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'more', 'movie', 'then', 'rate', 'have', 'funny', 'topless', 'interviews', 'girls', 'film', 'even', 'questions', 'are', 'very', 'lame', 'also', 'have', 'locker', 'room', 'scenes', 'were', 'expecting', 'see', 'movie', 'Guess', 'better', 'have', 'Special', 'Features', 'nowhere', '@', 'all.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'ever', 'saying', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'better', 'movie', 'case', 'here', 'NL', 'put', 'out', 'very', 'best', 'party', 'movies', 'time', 'VAN', 'WILDER', 'VACATION', 'ANIMAL', 'HOUSE', 'name', 'few', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'not', 'one', 'fact', 'not', 'even', 'close']",National Lampoon's Pucked

However, Frank runs into trouble when the credit card companies finally catch up with him and charge him with fraud.""National Lampoon's Pucked"" is a ""bad"" movie. You probably already know that. I knew it before I even purchased this DVD. With the exception of the ""Vacation"" movies, pretty much every movie with the words ""National Lampoon's"" in the title is a B-grade movie made on a low-budget using second-rate actors and a second-rate script, and ""Pucked"" is no exception. However, unlike some of the other ""National Lampoon"" movies, ""Pucked"" somehow manages to work.The cast of ""Pucked"" is made up of a bunch of has-beens and never-beens, but among them are Jon Bon Jovi, Curtis Armstrong (Booger from ""Revenge of the Nerds""), David Faustino (Bud from ""Married with Children"") and Cary Elwes. Sure, none of them are top actors anymore (if they ever were), but they all commit to the material that they are working with and through their belief in their characters and enthusiasm, manage to sell their characters to the audience. Similarly, the script of this film is certainly no Oscar contender, but it is well structured (better structured than ""Twilight"", which I saw the same day) and is surprisingly funny. Within the first 15 minutes there's a fight between Jon Bon Jovi and a midget! What more could you ask for?If you have ever liked any of the actors in this film, or just want to switch off your brain for 83 minutes and watch some mindless entertainment, then this film is worth a try.
