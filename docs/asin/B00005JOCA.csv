From the beginning, those on the radio had no idea of the panic they were creating outside and across America.You see the effect of the broadcast of H. G. Well's ""War of the Worlds"" on the wealthy, the poor, farmers, and those barely making ends meet.  You see them react the same way as they scurry about, desperate to save themselves from the bloodthirsty Marsians.There are so many levels of humanity shown in this film, that I wish they would release it on DVD or at least on VHS again.

I'm just happy to own it now. Great as an annual Halloween treat! By the way, the picture next to my review has absolutely NOTHING to do with what this movie is about! I guess Amazon doesn't have an appropriate picture for this.",4,Just As I Remembered It!,1292025600,"12 11, 2010",2010,393,"['Sure', 'dated', 'originally', 'was', 'TV', 'movie', 'back', '80s', 'think', 'brought', 'back', 'exact', 'same', 'feeling', 'when', 'watched', 'first', 'time', ""'m"", 'just', 'happy', 'own', 'now', 'Great', 'annual', 'Halloween', 'treat', 'way', 'picture', 'review', 'absolutely', 'NOTHING', 'do', 'what', 'movie', 'guess', 'Amazon', ""n't"", 'have', 'appropriate', 'picture']",The Night That Panicked America
640070,A13BTKZWPTVY9V,B00005JOCA,Nancy K. Grimes,"[24, 25]","This is a wonderful visual presentation of Orson Wells 1939 Halloween special radio broadcast. His version of H. G. Wells' book ""War of the Worlds"" was relocated to the USA, Dexter Mills, New Jersey to be exact. The location was chosen by a dart throw! The movie goes into details of how the sound effects were produced. Astounding and surprising! The actor who played the radio news announcer had listeners on the edge of their seats with his realistic emotions. So realistic, in fact, that the interruption of news bulletins is no longer allowed in any type of broadcast to this day! I bought a cassette tape of the original radio broadcast. I can see how this could have started the panic that it did. Especially since, back then, there were no commercials during the show. The people who tuned in late didn't know it was a show! The people in the studio had no idea what a stir they were causing! I believe you will be as impressed with this film as I am. I hope they produce it for sale on DVD very soon.",5,Very Impressive TV Movie!,1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,1009,"['wonderful', 'visual', 'presentation', 'Orson', 'Wells', '1939', 'Halloween', 'special', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'version', 'H.', 'G.', 'Wells', 'book', 'War', 'Worlds', 'was', 'relocated', 'USA', 'Dexter', 'Mills', 'New', 'Jersey', 'be', 'exact', 'location', 'was', 'chosen', 'dart', 'throw', 'movie', 'details', 'how', 'sound', 'effects', 'were', 'produced', 'Astounding', 'surprising', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'radio', 'news', 'announcer', 'had', 'listeners', 'edge', 'seats', 'realistic', 'emotions', 'So', 'realistic', 'fact', 'interruption', 'news', 'bulletins', 'longer', 'allowed', 'type', 'broadcast', 'day', 'bought', 'cassette', 'tape', 'original', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'started', 'panic', 'did', 'Especially', 'back', 'then', 'were', 'commercials', 'show', 'people', 'who', 'tuned', 'late', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'show', 'people', 'studio', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'stir', 'were', 'causing', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'impressed', 'film', 'am', 'hope', 'produce', 'sale', 'DVD', 'very', 'soon']",The Night That Panicked America

Why this movie has not released on DVD is beyond me, but who can explain the bufoons in Hollywood anyway?The thing I love the most is seeing a recreation of HOW this broadcast was done and all the backwork which was necessary in order for it to get on the air.
