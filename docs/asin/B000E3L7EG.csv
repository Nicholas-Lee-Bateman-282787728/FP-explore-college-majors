This would have made a fantastic episode of TWILIGHT ZONE / NIGHT GALLERY / ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS etc., w/ about 40 minutes shaved off. The story is interesting enough- girl plagued by ghostly / psychological / evil hauntings. It just needs a big trim. As it stands, it's not terrible / unwatchable, it's just bloated.

I really don't know if it was the script or the director, so I'll just blame both of them.I've never heard of Rubi Zack.  Not even sure if that's a man or a woman's name.  I see no other films that Zack has directed that I have heard of.  I bet there is a reason for that.Alex Barder, I am not trying to be mean, but maybe you should find another craft.  Writing a movie where the same thing happens over and over and over is jut not good writing.Ditto to the other writer of this film:  Jim SuthersOkay, now a bright spot about this movie.  Gina Philips is beautiful, a good actress, and cannot be blamed for the poor quality of the script or direction of this production.  She works hard to make her character believable; a woman who faces a less than pleasant past with a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety.  Her character is always experiencing flashbacks and haunt-backs throughout the film.Randall Batinkoff turns in the worst performance of his career.  His character, the main character's boyfriend, is not even remotely interesting or convincing.Jenny Mollen is not so bad in this film.Tom who?  Rent Lock Up, Sizemore is really good in that!  Just kidding, please don't kill me, Tom.Ring Around the Rosie reminds me of why I think I have a shot as a writer.  If this script was made into a movie, anything is possible.

967440,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000E3L7EG,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 6]","An hour into Ring Around the Rosie, I was wondering why in the name of H.P. Lovecraft so many reviewers trashed this movie.  It was genuinely creepy, suspenseful, disturbing in an I-haven't-figured-it-out-yet-but-I-have-some-ideas kind of way, and building up to something quite possibly momentous.  Very soon thereafter, though, the story suddenly became way too disjointed and tumbled into several what-the-heck-just-happened moments.  That most definitely is a problem, and I can see how some viewers would begin to turn on the film at that point.  I can also see how the ending leaves some viewers feeling as if the movie just gave them the finger.  Still, speaking as a horror veteran who has seen it all (or at least most of it), I think Ring Around the Rosie rises to the occasion much more often than it falls into clich&eacute;s.  If this would have been released ten years ago, it would certainly have generated more cheers than jeers.We horror fans are incredibly fortunate to have Gina Philips working in our genre; I would watch this gorgeous woman in anything at all, and I'm so thankful I don't have to suffer through sugary romances or chick flicks to bathe in her beauty.  I think she's even sexier when she's scared - and her character, Karin, is scared quite a lot during Ring Around the Rosie.  The fact that she already suffers from strange nightmares does not bode well when Karin inherits the country house where she and her sister used to spend their summers.  She and her boyfriend head out there to begin packing things up and getting the house ready to sell.  It's soon obvious that something just isn't right around there, with a lot of the mystery seemingly associated with a mysterious closet door.  Despite some unsettling experiences in the house, though, her boyfriend leaves here there - out in the middle of the country with no transportation - for several days.  That's when she meets Pierce (Tom Sizemore), a strange fellow who has been looking after the place.  Pierce looks a little bit French to me, so I didn't trust him from the start.  Things soon progress from weird noises and nightmares to unexplainable occurrences and real danger - a trend which continues after Karen's sister Wendy (Jenny Mollen) shows up a few days later.It wouldn't be appropriate for me to describe the kind of things that happen as this film moves along its singularly unique track.  I can say that the story takes on an atmosphere of increasing creepiness and suspense, though.  I actually think the ending is pretty effective, and some viewers won't really see it coming - heck, even I was surprised by certain elements of it.  The only problem I have with the film is the way it rushes through a few scenes without really tying them together - it feels like the director forgot to actually remove some deleted scenes.  In a way, though, this disjointed sense of the later action works in concert with the story's idiosyncratic nature.Obviously, I can't guarantee you will enjoy this film as much as I did.  If you think every film is supposed to explain every single plot element to you at the end, chances are you won't regard this film too highly.  This isn't an episode of Scooby Doo.  Personally, I like and appreciate the odd horror film that doesn't spell every plot element out for me in the end.  One's own imagination is a much more effective story-teller than any Hollywood scriptwriter, so what's wrong with a film leaving a few things open to your own interpretation?  This film does make sense, but it doesn't cater to your every whim or leave time for questions and answers during the end credits.  To some viewers, that's a bad thing, but I find it rather refreshing.",4,Genuinely creepy and suspenseful - albeit a little disjointed,1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,3705,"['hour', 'Ring', 'Rosie', 'was', 'wondering', 'why', 'name', 'H.P', 'Lovecraft', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'trashed', 'movie', 'was', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'suspenseful', 'disturbing', ""I-haven't-figured-it-out-yet-but-I-have-some-ideas"", 'kind', 'way', 'building', 'up', 'something', 'quite', 'possibly', 'momentous', 'Very', 'soon', 'thereafter', 'story', 'suddenly', 'became', 'way', 'too', 'disjointed', 'tumbled', 'several', 'what-the-heck-just-happened', 'moments', 'most', 'definitely', 'problem', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'viewers', 'would', 'begin', 'turn', 'film', 'point', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'ending', 'viewers', 'feeling', 'movie', 'just', 'gave', 'finger', 'Still', 'speaking', 'horror', 'veteran', 'who', 'seen', 'least', 'most', 'think', 'Ring', 'Rosie', 'occasion', 'much', 'more', 'often', 'clich', 'eacute', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'generated', 'more', 'cheers', 'jeers.We', 'horror', 'fans', 'are', 'incredibly', 'fortunate', 'have', 'Gina', 'Philips', 'working', 'genre', 'would', 'watch', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'anything', ""'m"", 'so', 'thankful', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'suffer', 'sugary', 'romances', 'chick', 'flicks', 'bathe', 'beauty', 'think', 'even', 'sexier', 'when', 'scared', 'character', 'Karin', 'scared', 'quite', 'lot', 'Ring', 'Rosie', 'fact', 'already', 'strange', 'nightmares', 'not', 'bode', 'well', 'when', 'Karin', 'country', 'house', 'where', 'sister', 'used', 'spend', 'summers', 'boyfriend', 'head', 'there', 'begin', 'packing', 'things', 'up', 'getting', 'house', 'ready', 'sell', 'soon', 'obvious', 'something', 'just', ""n't"", 'right', 'there', 'lot', 'mystery', 'seemingly', 'associated', 'mysterious', 'closet', 'door', 'unsettling', 'experiences', 'house', 'though', 'boyfriend', 'here', 'out', 'middle', 'country', 'transportation', 'several', 'days', 'when', 'Pierce', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'strange', 'fellow', 'who', 'been', 'looking', 'place', 'Pierce', 'little', 'bit', 'French', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'trust', 'start', 'Things', 'soon', 'progress', 'weird', 'noises', 'nightmares', 'unexplainable', 'occurrences', 'real', 'danger', 'trend', 'Karen', 'sister', 'Wendy', 'Jenny', 'Mollen', 'up', 'few', 'days', 'later.It', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'appropriate', 'describe', 'kind', 'things', 'happen', 'film', 'singularly', 'unique', 'track', 'can', 'say', 'story', 'atmosphere', 'increasing', 'creepiness', 'suspense', 'actually', 'think', 'ending', 'pretty', 'effective', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'coming', 'heck', 'even', 'was', 'surprised', 'certain', 'elements', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'way', 'few', 'scenes', 'really', 'tying', 'together', 'director', 'forgot', 'actually', 'remove', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'way', 'though', 'disjointed', 'sense', 'later', 'action', 'works', 'concert', 'story', 'idiosyncratic', 'nature.Obviously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'guarantee', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'think', 'film', 'supposed', 'explain', 'single', 'plot', 'element', 'end', 'chances', 'are', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regard', 'film', 'too', 'highly', ""n't"", 'episode', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Personally', 'like', 'appreciate', 'odd', 'horror', 'film', ""n't"", 'spell', 'plot', 'element', 'end', 'One', 'own', 'imagination', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'story-teller', 'Hollywood', 'scriptwriter', 'what', 'wrong', 'film', 'leaving', 'few', 'things', 'open', 'own', 'interpretation', 'film', 'make', 'sense', ""n't"", 'cater', 'whim', 'leave', 'time', 'questions', 'answers', 'end', 'credits', 'viewers', 'bad', 'thing', 'find', 'rather', 'refreshing']",Ring Around the Rosie

967443,A2G3TECYO58ON7,B000E3L7EG,Ethan D. Van Sciver,"[0, 1]","RING AROUND THE ROSIES is a pocket full of poop.  Apparently someone thought it was a good idea to remake 1950's schlock flick ""The Screaming Skull"" without the skull, but with all the screaming.  And Gina Philips screams a lot, often for no particular discernible reason, leaving us to try to figure out if SHE'S what we're supposed to be frightened of.  I was scared of her.  I pity her character's husband, who splits early in the film, leaving her looked after by the gardener, who is played by a life-sized but not quite life-like Tom Sizemore marionette.Characters say very flat, obvious things to each other, and are always met with ""Really?"" as a response.  Count the number of times this happens.  It will bother you. It may be the shabbiest script ever written.Also, Gina Philips is a special brand of over actor.  You won't believe the bizarre physical choices she makes in bringing her character to life.  For example, she's walking down the stairs with a stack of papers and books, only to find her friend at the bottom of the stairs to greet her.  She literally drops 35 lbs of books and debris all over herself in surprise!  But it's no big deal.  The scene just carries on.Anyhow, long story short, Gina Philips has nightmares all the time, though I'm not sure why, and Tom Sizemore may or may not be a bad guy.

967447,ASHBFCUZAYCS4,B000E3L7EG,"Lord Schitsdain ""The sage of rage""","[2, 3]","This is a movie that attempts to unseat Troll 2 as the undisputed worst horror film ever. At least Troll 2 was so bad it was entertaining. There is nothing entertaining in this disaster, unless you are into soft core girl on girl incest. We have wet T-shirts, hugging, cuddling, spooning in bed, and even a pillow fight! Meow. What more could you ask from a whore movie? Oh wait, I meant horror movie, and a few scares would've been nice. The production team couldn't afford 100 monkeys and typewriters, so they opted for 5 alleged ""writers"" sequestered away in 5 different locations with no interaction between them, and instructed them to write a script and use the phrase ""Don't worry, I won't let you fall"". Those scripts were then put through a food processor and reassembled by Helen Keller to creat the working script. The director decided to try out as many edgy camera techniques as possible to see what works best in case he ever gets to make a ""real"" movie. You get to see shaky cam, blurry cam, blurry shaky cam, slo-mo, 45 degree shutter (Tom Sizemore stole that one from Saving Private Ryan, or was it 28 Days Later?) POV cam, and cam & cheese, heavy on the cheese. The acting was as bad as the direction as Gina Phillips over-reacted and hyperventilated through the whole movie. She was afraid of rats, roadkill, chickens, Pierce, reflections, wind, closets, slopes, ponies, swings, and her own shadow, not necessarily in that order. Maybe if Gina had been in the audience istead of on screen, this movie would've scared at least one person. Tom Sizemore alternated between creepily friendly, lecherous, and psycho violent at the flick of a switch. Wendy just stayed horny most of the time. The editing was utterly incoherent. One minute they would be eating dinner, then Karen & Wendy are running up the driveway to Wendy's car which won't start (not in a horror movie!! What are the odds? Oh the humanity.)then a brief flashback to Pierce attacking Karen in the closet, to Karen throwing up in the toilet, punching out the medicine cabinet, then seeing Wendy isn't in the bed (maybe she's trying to jump start the car) then cut to a scene of Wendy dancing with Pierce in the tack barn. All this in the space of about 2 min. All this jumping from location to location for no reason, intercut with flashbacks and hallucinations, makes the ""plot"" hard to follow. Fear not, for it will all become perfectly clear with the low-rent M. Night Shyamalan wannabe twist ending. Turns out Wendy has been dead for 17 years. Wait...oh crap...don't read that part. **Spoiler alert** Too late now I guess. If you put the clues together you come to the conclusion that Grandpa had molested Karen and was getting an eye for Wendy. When Karen tried to stop him, apparently Wendy was knocked off the balcony and died. The scenes in the movie were Karen exercising her demons and getting some kind of closure. Pierce personified Grandpa and was a figment of her imagination. It is a cheap cop-out to explain away huge plot holes as being the result of a delusional mind. Shame on you filmakers. If you were to rewatch the film with the foreknowledge that Pierce represents Bad Grandpa, then the painfully clumsy, bad dialog becomes a string of disturbing sexual double entendre. Phrases like: ""You've gotta show them who's boss and that they ARE going to be ridden."" ""Climb on, put your right hand here, don't squeeze your legs too tight, grab this, happy endings, wanna come with me, get in the bed, what do you do better than dance""? etc. I've seen a few thrillers like this lately that have resorted to the incest angle to create the antagonist. Giving Grandpas a bad name. This movie looked like a decent production cinematography wise, but was doomed by a lame script, weak premise, and horrible acting. The elements were there: house with red hallway, rats, fake deer that they got for half price because it was missing an antler, fake blood, tub, mirrors, wind and rain machines, guns and knives, axe, creepy music and boobies. What went wrong? I figure that the masochists among you will ignore advice to the contrary and insist on at least renting this mess just to see if it is really all that bad. A used copy is less than a buck, but then you have to pay shipping, and it is not worth it.

967450,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000E3L7EG,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Ring Around the Rosie (Rubi Zack, 2006)Here's a movie that really looks like it's going somewhere, then it cops out. It's not as disappointing as Les Revenants, because it never gets anywhere near that good, but it does look like it has at least a little potential-- a decent cast, some great scenery, character interaction that really does have a creepy feel to it, and then all the sudden, bam. You're stuck in the hell that is the Hollywood clich&eacute;.The story: Karen Baldwin (Jeepers Creepers' Gina Philips) inherits her grandparents' summer home, with express deathbed instructions from her grandmother to clean it up and sell it. She and her boyfriend Jeff (Randall Batinkoff, Dead Man's Curve) drive out to do the job, then they realize that it's going to take a lot more time than they thought. Jeff heads back to his job in the city, leaving Karen to do the job, assisted by Pierce (Paparazzi's Tom Sizemore), the caretaker. Karen is surprised by the arrival of her sister Wendy (D.E.B.S.' Jenny Mollen), and before long, the two of them are spending a lot more time reminiscing than actually getting anything done. Karen, however, is quite unhappy with the attention Pierce is paying Wendy, and Wendy's flirtatious attitude towards it.The biggest problem with the movie is that you can see the ending coming no more than five minutes in. The second-biggest is that the script-- which it seems to have taken four people to write, according to IMDB-- never even attempts to give you any red herrings or the like; it's a mystery/thriller where there's no mystery and very few thrills. I wouldn't call it (as some IMDB pundits have) the worst movie ever-- I'd rather sit through this for a week straight, on infinite repeat, than every have to watch five minutes of Dances with Wolves ever again-- but there's absolutely nothing about it to recommend. The acting is competent, but rarely rises above that (and when it does, it's usually Tom Sizemore's fault); the same can be said of the direction, without anything after the ""but"". The pacing is awful, the cinematography pedestrian. Even the sound doesn't stand out. It's a perfectly bland film. But at least it achieved perfection in one respect. **",2,"Tries, fails.",1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,2212,"['Ring', 'Rosie', 'Rubi', 'Zack', '2006', 'Here', 'movie', 'really', 'going', 'somewhere', 'then', 'out', 'not', 'as', 'disappointing', 'Les', 'Revenants', 'never', 'anywhere', 'good', 'look', 'least', 'little', 'potential', 'decent', 'cast', 'great', 'scenery', 'character', 'interaction', 'really', 'have', 'creepy', 'feel', 'then', 'sudden', 'bam', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'hell', 'Hollywood', 'clich', 'eacute', 'story', 'Karen', 'Baldwin', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'Gina', 'Philips', 'grandparents', 'summer', 'home', 'express', 'deathbed', 'instructions', 'grandmother', 'clean', 'up', 'sell', 'boyfriend', 'Jeff', 'Randall', 'Batinkoff', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Curve', 'drive', 'out', 'do', 'job', 'then', 'realize', 'going', 'take', 'lot', 'more', 'time', 'thought', 'Jeff', 'back', 'job', 'city', 'leaving', 'Karen', 'do', 'job', 'assisted', 'Pierce', 'Paparazzi', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'caretaker', 'Karen', 'surprised', 'arrival', 'sister', 'Wendy', 'D.E.B.S', 'Jenny', 'Mollen', 'long', 'two', 'are', 'spending', 'lot', 'more', 'time', 'reminiscing', 'actually', 'getting', 'anything', 'done', 'Karen', 'however', 'quite', 'unhappy', 'attention', 'Pierce', 'paying', 'Wendy', 'Wendy', 'flirtatious', 'attitude', 'towards', 'it.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'ending', 'coming', 'no', 'more', 'five', 'minutes', 'second-biggest', 'script', 'have', 'taken', 'four', 'people', 'write', 'according', 'IMDB', 'never', 'even', 'attempts', 'give', 'red', 'herrings', 'like', 'mystery/thriller', 'where', 'mystery', 'very', 'few', 'thrills', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'IMDB', 'pundits', 'have', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', ""'d"", 'rather', 'sit', 'week', 'straight', 'infinite', 'repeat', 'have', 'watch', 'five', 'minutes', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'ever', 'again', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'recommend', 'acting', 'competent', 'rarely', 'when', 'usually', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'fault', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'direction', 'anything', 'pacing', 'awful', 'cinematography', 'pedestrian', 'Even', 'sound', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'perfectly', 'bland', 'film', 'least', 'achieved', 'perfection', 'one', 'respect', '**']",Ring Around the Rosie

Others in the genre are Blacktop, starring Meatloaf - and The Barber starring Malcolm McDowell. Many of these others are Canadian productions.Ring Around the Rosie is an American production, but follows suit by featuring Tom Sizemore, an actor with some formidable credentials who turns in an absolutely stunning performance here. It's too bad this movie comes from the general thriller-mill and so doesn't get considered for any Academy Awards. If it did, Tom Sizemore would surely merit a nomination for his riveting portrayal of menace hiding behind amiable helpfulness.Perhaps I have seen too many of these thrillers, so I've become a bit jaded. But I found the plot rather predictable. What may be intended as a twist-ending didn't quite twist for me. And the special effects camera work similarly struck me as cliche. The cutting of frames so that the characters move jaggedly - now they are in the distance, now they are on top of you - with no time in between - has become a common technique.Nevertheless, the film has some suspense.

I was interested in their names, but sadly the film is terribly boring, even though it runs less than 90 minutes.Gina Philips plays Karen, a young business woman who inherits a house in a remote place in the countryside, which might or might not be haunted. Near the house lives a caretaker played by Tom Sizemore, who might or might not be possessed by something evil. The premise is all too familiar, used recently in such films as ""The Amityville Horror,"" and with the right direction the film would be thrilling.But you will soon realize that there in no thrills of any kind, not even a surprise by sudden big sound, in ""Ring Around the Rosie"" which introduces many recycled bits of images seen in other thrillers - from rudimentary tricks like shadows moving behind the door, a weird reflection in the mirror, strange noise in the midnight or unreliable neighbor staring at the protagonist, to the heroine tormented by nightmares and her buried memories of the past.The film has also Karen's amiable boyfriend (Randall Batinkoff) and her lovely younger sister (Jenny Mollen). The former leaves the house while Karen stays to clean up the house; the latter arrives there and what Karen sees and hears start to get stranger. Considering the nature of the conclusion and suggested history of Karen's childhood (which I cannot disclose here), there could be some psychological explanations about the strange events that terrorize Karen, as in such thrillers as `The Others."" That's what I thought while trying not to sleep, but no matter how I try, I cannot find one in this disjointed story that is confusing and illogical. If you see a character falling from the window and another character catches her in his arms in a cartoon-like way, you realize this is not a very good psychological thriller.Or maybe I am thinking too much. Probably this is another badly written horror film you might find in your rental video shop, borrow it and regret it later.
