1613208,A59NEDTG1DHG7,B00AM27WJI,Addicted2Amazon!,"[0, 0]","About me:  I LOVE at-home workouts.  I own a LOT.  I guess I would have to say that I am at the high intermediate to advanced level.  Even though I have a lot of DVDs, I generally have always avoided Jillian Michaels because, well, I don't need to be yelled at in order to work out.  I enjoy working out and even when I don't, I make myself do it AND make myself enjoy it because it's great for me and makes me feel good (and LOOK good, of course!).  I brush my teeth, I wear makeup, I work out.  It's just a personal responsibility for me.  I don't need a drill sergeant to keep me in line.  I keep myself in line.That being said...I finally realized that I never try her and broke down just for the variety of trying a new instructor.  I must say, I'm glad I did!  I really enjoy this workout!  It's not crazy, drag-out tough, but it's challenging, effective, and, at 45 minutes, just right time-wise. I'm not sure if all of her DVDs are like this, but I really enjoyed Jillian leading this workout.  Instead of being yelled at and insulted, which is what I expected, I found her funny and energetic.  She IS tough with a loud voice and a big personality, but I found it more of a refreshing, gruff teasing method than an army officer barking at me.  She made me laugh with her interactions with the 4 other women in the DVD and also was encouraging and positive.  Cool!As expected from a fitness superstar like her, the DVD's production is top notch.  The lighting, the fab workout clothing on her and her 4 backup workout gals, the set, all very nice.  The music was great, I really enjoyed working out to it.  And speaking of, yes, there are some unnecessary shots of the DJ.  (He's cute though! :-) )  However, the shots are pretty brief, and the only times I noticed was when he was shown in between exercises.  During the exercises, I was too busy sweating/balancing/staring at the ceiling b/c I was on my back, often not even looking at the TV.  It didn't really bother me, and hey, he did a great job!  Love the beats!There are 2 45-minute workouts on the DVD, a Level 1 workout and a supposedly more advanced Level 2 one.  As of the date of this review, I've only done the Level 1.  I will be doing this one for a couple months and then, when I do Level 2, I'll update my review.  Level 1 is nice!  One thing that I like about ""Hard Body"" that is different from most of my other DVDs is a lack of rigid, 8-count, choreographed reps.  I like that sort of structure, obviously.  But it was nice to just jump into moves and just start doing it, no counting, just going at your own pace until she tells you to stop.As far as the exercises themselves, they were a blend of strength moves interspersed with cardio moves.  The workout definitely had my heart rate up the whole time.  In fact, with exception of upper body, I felt like I get more of a cardio benefit with a little bit of toning.  I felt this in my lower body a good bit, my abs a little bit but my upper body was really feeling it, with mostly 5 lb. and sometimes 3 lb. weights.  My upper body was the only part of my body that I felt was thoroughly fatigued by the end of this workout.  I actually work my lower body and abs a tiny bit more afterwards and THEN I feel like I've thorougly worked everything.The moves are fun and effective, and are generally done at a good pace.  The girls try to stay synchronized in their moves while Jillian often walks around giving pointers on form and beginner/advanced variations.  However, I found it better to adjust the speed of a move based upon my personal preference.  While some moves I found really well-paced and a challenge for me to keep up with, other moves I felt were too slow for me personally.  I found that speeding up some moves made them much more intense.  Some of my favorite moves are Suicides (you know, that warmup that basketball players often do when they run to one side of the court, touch the ground and then run to the other side), weighted burpees, the pivot-lunge-punch with weight, the squat and pivot up with arms out and parallel to the ground (with weights).  The hardest move, for me, is that dreaded walking push-up with a hop up and hop side to side and then back down again.  Whew!  I still cannot do every rep!  Still working on that!  KILLS my upper body, and even my legs feel that hopping!So all in all, I really enjoy this workout!  I'm very glad I gave JM a try, and I will definitely keep her in mind when getting new workout DVDs in the future!UPDATE 03/19/14: So I finally tired of the Level 1 workout and moved on to Level 2...and wow!  It's definitely harder!  And it's not like just a step up harder, it's more like 5 times harder!!  Wow!  Whereas with Level 1, I had fun but needed more at the end, with Level 2 I am crawling for the finish line, yelling, ""Finally!""  This workout worked me all over, and fried my lower body in particular, which I loved.  I mean, my butt and thighs were burnt out.  I also got a good upper body workout with this.  The only part of my body that felt a little lightly worked were my abs, so I still add a few minutes of ab work after this workout.  But this workout is solid. Most of these moves are so much more difficult to execute than they appear to be when you're sitting on your couch previewing it!  :-) Some of my favorite moves include: the plyo squat with the front arm row with weights (Jillian reeeally lets you hang out here in this move the 2nd time you do it...I was cursing at her to let me stop!); the wall-to-wall plyo squat with one weight where you start squatted down facing one wall, then leap into a squat facing the other wall and then back (whew...the burn!); the ""pass-the-weight"" move where you're on your stomach and pass a weight from in front of you, behind your back...WHILE keeping your arms and legs raised up in a Superman pose...shockingly tough!; the two goddess squat exercises; the kettlebell swing while jumping into a deep squat forward and back; and my personal favorite, the plyo lunge while lifting your weight-holding arms out into a fly, palms down (I encounter a lot of plyo lunges in my workouts...it's a great, effective move but I thought I'd bounce right through this one...could not BELIEVE how much tougher this was than it looked!).  Some moves I modified because they were either too tough (I just can't do more than one of that outside knee to outside elbow/""grasshopper"" pushup...I try, but I usually do one cycle and then just hold a plank while I move my knees and legs...SO impossible!) or because they're unneccesarily complicated (the one-armed mountain climber just requires too much mental concentration to adhere to, and I'm a coordinated person!...I just do a regular, two-armed mountain climber...STILL tough because by the time I get to this point, I'm already sweating and panting).Solid, challenging workout!",4,My First Jillian Michaels DVD!

The format is different on these workouts than her previous ones, which is nice a nice change. I found some of the moves to be challenging, but definitely doable for an advanced exerciser aware of proper body alignment. The workouts are awesome! Every body part felt worked, and I am still feeling it! Once I got the moves down, I went to my zone and at my own pace.I don't feel the need to keep my eyes glued to the tv during workouts. The dj didn't bother me at all, and I didn't even notice that the girls were out of sync(and who cares about that?this isn't dance aerobics). And personally, I think Jillian's great. You either love her or hate her.I didn't even notice most of her comments, as I was too busy concentrating on my form. Great workout Jillian!

If it sounds overwhelming, I would recommend one of Jillian's previous DVDs such as &#34;Extreme Shed & Shred&#34; or &#34;Kickbox FastFix&#34;, both of which have a similar aesthetic and workout routine style to this one but their moves are not as insane.I have all of Jillian's DVDs, and this is by far my favorite workout.  It feels more fast paced than her others.  You're constantly changing moves and positions (which my very short attention span loves) and even halfway through you feel like you've gotten a real total body workout.  This is part of what makes this DVD my favorite of hers.Most of Jillian's workouts divide the body (Workout A will be back, biceps, and quads, Workout B will be shoulders, triceps and butt).  The ones that are total body workouts (like Extreme Shed & Shred) still somehow feel like they're targeting some parts of the body more than others.  This is the first Jillian workout that feels like it hits everything equally hard.  It's intense, full of awesome combinations like pushup-to-plank-row-to-mountain-climbers, and at the end you're thinking &#34;I can not believe I just completed that!!&#34;On a personal note, Jillian has also toned down her god complex in this one.  I love Jillian, but sometimes her ego can be a bit much and she can get kind of preachy.  Not as much in this one.  While the moves are more kick-a** than in her other workouts, she's a bit softer.  She's more like a trainer and less like a shouty drill sergeant.

Level 1 just didn't flow nicely for me; too many complicated combinations (and no I'm not a beginner in fitness).  For example, traveling push-ups into standing lateral jumps?  It was too confusing for me, and I was disappointed. Which sucks because I am a die hard Jillian fan; I see Jillian as my life coach, not just my fitness instructor (I love her pep talks).  Even though I didn't like this workout, I do appreciate Jillian's attempt for creativity.So, why am I still giving this DVD a 4 star? Because level 2 ROCKS!!!!  I was a bit fearful of trying level 2, but I did it today and it was amazing!  A total kick butt workout! I had to use the modifications for a lot of the moves, but I was still dripping in sweat afterwards!  Level 2 is completely different from level 1, it had a waaaay better flow.  I do not regret buying this DVD at all because level 2 is totally worth it!I think I will do the Extreme Shed & Shred DVD for a couple weeks before adding level two to my regular routine though, because it was pretty intense.Oh, and the DJ?

Schneider,"[0, 0]","I don't do all of Jillian's workouts, but usually try them when they come out, because even though her style of exercise isn't what I normally gravitate to (I usually do kickboxing, pilates, dance or yoga) I do find her workouts to be effective.  So, I gave this one a go.  There are two workouts of about 45 minutes in length and level 1 is easier than level 2 supposedly.  I liked level 2 better, but probably because I liked the exercises a bit more.  I like this kind of training where you do the entire circuit, short and sweet and then do it again.  No endless repetitions, just get through and move onto the next exercise.  The workout uses light and heavier weights or no weights at all as is demonstrated by her modifier.

That way you're concentrating on one move without trying to get complicated choreography down.  This one is like that.I also like that this workout video was challenging, but with enough modifiers to go easier or harder, and then an option to grab lighter or heavier weights.At 45 minutes, it's a good length.  Due to my schedule, I prefer something closer to 30 minutes, like 6 week six-pack.I was moderately sore the next day, so i know it did something.There were a few moves that I think had too much going on at once.

But I never would have thought in a million years I'd give a Jillian workout a 3 star rating.  But I am.  I only worked through workout 1 so far, but...something's just weird about this one.  As a workout, it's good.  But the production quality is distracting.  I don't want to see constant quick shots of the DJ, especially while in the midst of doing reps of something - I need to see the girls that are working out - the DJ doesn't have weights nor is he displaying the form you're to be using.  Can't see the modification options or if you're keeping up with the girls or check your form if you're looking at a DJ who's trying to act like he's in a club somewhere.  I also don't like the moving camera that looks like it's just held on someone's shoulder and constantly moving.  It's like she was shooting a music video instead of a workout video.  It's very distracting and hard to focus on form when you can't focus on the women working out or even see them part of the time. And the women she has working out with her aren't always in sync like her back ups in other videos.  It just seemed like it was slapped together and not real high on the quality.  Again, as a WORKOUT it was pretty good.  A little quick through a lot of the moves, but not bad. Hopefully the second workout on the DVD is a little better.  One reviewer mentioned it was kind of a long circuit repeated twice rather than the more structured, focused circuits of 30 Day Shred and Ripped in 30 and I have to agree.  I loved the 3-2-1 system best of all her workouts.  But this longer circuit through twice isn't horrible.  It's that way in her 6 Week 6 Pack - do all the moves, repeat once, you're done.  I just really have mixed feelings about this one though. I loved some of the new twists she put on old moves.  I will say that.  But wish she had stuck to the production quality of previous videos and didn't go through all of the moves and modifications so quickly.",3,Hmmm....,1362528000,"03 6, 2013",2013,2048,"['First', 'love', 'Jillian', 'workouts', 'have', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'see', 'one', 'coming', 'out', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'million', 'years', ""'d"", 'give', 'Jillian', 'workout', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'am', 'only', 'worked', 'workout', '1', 'so', 'far', 'something', 'just', 'weird', 'one', 'workout', 'good', 'production', 'quality', 'distracting', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'constant', 'quick', 'shots', 'DJ', 'especially', 'midst', 'doing', 'reps', 'something', 'need', 'see', 'girls', 'are', 'working', 'out', 'DJ', ""n't"", 'have', 'weights', 'displaying', 'form', ""'re"", 'be', 'using', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'modification', 'options', ""'re"", 'keeping', 'up', 'girls', 'check', 'form', ""'re"", 'looking', 'DJ', 'who', 'trying', 'act', 'club', 'somewhere', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'moving', 'camera', 'just', 'held', 'someone', 'shoulder', 'constantly', 'moving', 'was', 'shooting', 'music', 'video', 'instead', 'workout', 'video', 'very', 'distracting', 'hard', 'focus', 'form', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'focus', 'women', 'working', 'out', 'even', 'see', 'part', 'time', 'women', 'working', 'out', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'sync', 'back', 'ups', 'other', 'videos', 'just', 'seemed', 'was', 'slapped', 'together', 'not', 'real', 'high', 'quality', 'Again', 'WORKOUT', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'little', 'quick', 'lot', 'moves', 'not', 'bad', 'Hopefully', 'second', 'workout', 'DVD', 'little', 'better', 'One', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'was', 'kind', 'long', 'circuit', 'repeated', 'twice', 'rather', 'more', 'structured', 'focused', 'circuits', '30', 'Day', 'Shred', 'Ripped', '30', 'have', 'agree', 'loved', '3-2-1', 'system', 'best', 'workouts', 'longer', 'circuit', 'twice', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'way', '6', 'Week', '6', 'Pack', 'do', 'moves', 'repeat', 'once', ""'re"", 'done', 'just', 'really', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'one', 'though', 'loved', 'new', 'twists', 'put', 'old', 'moves', 'will', 'say', 'wish', 'had', 'stuck', 'production', 'quality', 'previous', 'videos', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'moves', 'modifications', 'so', 'quickly']",N/A

All it takes is just using her workouts for about three weeks, and I drop weight and tone up quickly.  I know that this new ones of hers will get plenty of use.This new workout is broken down into two sections:  Workout 1 clocks in at just about 45 minutes (including the warm-up and cooldown) and Workout 2 clocks in at about 48 minutes (including the warm-up and cooldown).  To do the workout, you'll need some dumbbells ranging from 3-10 pounds, depending on your fitness level and strength.Another reviewer already provided a breakdown of each of the workouts, so I'll focus on other aspects of this disk.The cardio in Hard Body is mostly high impact, but you can modify if needed and one of the background exercisers does modify all of the moves.  You do six circuits in each workout one time through, and then you repeat the circuit another time.  Jillian doesn't use her 3-2-1 format in Hard Body, but it's still effective and tough.  The moves/exercises are also ones that are in her other workouts, but she puts them together in new ways, so that the two workouts on Hard Body feel fresh.The background set on Hard Body is also different from her other workouts (I don't have Body Revolution, but I've seen some clips from it, and it looks like the same set), and she has four background exercisers, instead of her usual two.  The background sort of looks like a prison to me (with its barred windows and bleak grey colors), but that's not much of a turn-off for me.The shots of the DJ didn't bother me as much as they did other reviewers, but perhaps that was because I was gasping for air too much while doing this!  :-)  Jillian's personality was also a bit more toned down in this one, which I appreciated.Overall, if you're looking for an advanced workout to change up your routines, this is a good one to get!",4,Another tough one from Jillian!,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,2105,"['have', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'Jillian', 'workouts', 'hate', 'how', 'hard', 'are', 'love', 'what', 'do', 'body', 'have', 'collection', 'close', '300', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'working', 'out', 'one', 'main', 'hobbies', 'Jillian', 'always', 'get', 'results', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'just', 'using', 'workouts', 'about', 'three', 'weeks', 'drop', 'weight', 'tone', 'up', 'quickly', 'know', 'new', 'ones', 'hers', 'will', 'get', 'plenty', 'use.This', 'new', 'workout', 'broken', 'down', 'two', 'sections', '1', 'clocks', 'just', '45', 'minutes', 'including', 'warm-up', 'cooldown', '2', 'clocks', '48', 'minutes', 'including', 'warm-up', 'cooldown', 'do', 'workout', ""'ll"", 'need', 'dumbbells', 'ranging', '3-10', 'pounds', 'depending', 'fitness', 'level', 'strength.Another', 'reviewer', 'already', 'provided', 'breakdown', 'workouts', ""'ll"", 'focus', 'other', 'aspects', 'disk.The', 'cardio', 'Hard', 'Body', 'mostly', 'high', 'impact', 'can', 'modify', 'needed', 'one', 'background', 'modify', 'moves', 'do', 'six', 'circuits', 'one', 'time', 'then', 'repeat', 'circuit', 'time', 'Jillian', ""n't"", 'use', '3-2-1', 'format', 'Hard', 'Body', 'still', 'effective', 'tough', 'moves/exercises', 'are', 'also', 'ones', 'are', 'other', 'workouts', 'together', 'new', 'ways', 'two', 'workouts', 'Hard', 'Body', 'feel', 'fresh.The', 'background', 'set', 'Hard', 'Body', 'also', 'different', 'other', 'workouts', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Body', 'Revolution', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'clips', 'same', 'set', 'four', 'background', 'exercisers', 'instead', 'usual', 'two', 'background', 'sort', 'looks', 'prison', 'barred', 'windows', 'bleak', 'grey', 'colors', 'not', 'much', 'turn-off', 'me.The', 'shots', 'DJ', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'other', 'reviewers', 'perhaps', 'was', 'was', 'gasping', 'air', 'too', 'much', 'doing', 'Jillian', 'personality', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'more', 'toned', 'down', 'one', 'appreciated.Overall', ""'re"", 'looking', 'advanced', 'workout', 'change', 'up', 'routines', 'good', 'one', 'get']",N/A

I no longer dread it but kind of look forward to it.

I've never been disappointed by any of them and always see the results. Hardbody is no exception and it makes me excited for her next video!I know some people don't like the new format, but I personally love it - it really mixes things up from her previous videos and offers something new. And I'm not gonna lie, I'm kind of diggin' the DJ. It's just something different and I enjoy it. I feel like it goes really fast because you're constantly moving on to new moves before you repeat everything again, as opposed to doing three moves and then repeating them again immediately.I haven't tried Level 2 yet. I usually like to wait until I've mastered one level before moving on to the next. I'm still feeling pretty beat by doing all of level 1, but I'm hoping to start Level 2 next week sometime.Overall, I've found Hardbody to be innovative, challenging and it really keeps my interest. I do enjoy mixing JM's longer workouts in with her shorter ones. I'll usually do her Ripped and Shred videos on days when I'm in a hurry, and then do her Extreme Shed and Shred and now Hardbody on days I have more time.

I have found myself getting bored, so I needed something new to try. Between No More Trouble Zones and this one, they are the top two hardest DVD's of Jillian's I have done... And hard is good since I'm needing a change in my workout routine.She incorporates several classic moves from other DVD's as well as new movies I have not done yet. It is a 45 minute workout that keeps you sweating the entire time. I wore my heart rate monitor to see how many calories were burned, and it was over 300 for the 45 minutes I worked out. The DVD has two workouts, level one and two like most of her workouts. I have not tried level two yet, but if level one challenged met he way it did, I can assume level two is going to be an even bigger butt kicker. In this workout, there are 6 circuits that you go through twice - the second circuit she has you pick up the pace since you &#34;know&#34; the moves now. All you need are free weights and a positive attitude.... in fact, if you have different size weights, that's even better, as she wants you to increase weight as you progress through the workout. Also, if you're a beginner, just like other Jillian DVD's, there are beginner modifications so everyone can attempt the workout.The only complaint I have about the DVD is that she has a life DJ there and the camera continuously flashes to him dancing to the music he's playing. I'm not sure what the point is of that -- maybe she wanted to try a different style with this one to keep pace up, but I found it distracting and deterring from the actual workout itself.
