A tremendously moving, powerful story that is both very sad but with great things to say as to the resilience of humanity, the power of goodness and hope, the importance of honesty and truth, and the need for courage and tenacity in the face of tragedy and war. This film to me was faultless, majestic, and yet proceeded with a lightness of touch that is rarely matched.

1234275,A3LJPQO3DVHNO5,B001RVKGBO,JayCee,"[1, 1]","This movie is rewarding on so many levels and it is hard for me to critique it. The story is mesmerizing, albeit disturbing and so uplifting. The relationship of the two main characters is beautiful as Athos attempts to relieve the anxiety of young Jakob. The tenderness each shows the other as they age and the role reversal is moving. The addition of the extended family and the relationship between Jakob and the young neighbor boy added so much dimension to the story. The movie haunted me for days but I am ready to watch it again. Some may think the ending is trite but I was delighted with the conclusion. Stephen Dillane is brilliant as he portrays each phase of Jakob's life.

1234277,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B001RVKGBO,Robert J. Crawford,"[7, 8]","***spoiler alert***This is an extraordinary gem that I feel lucky to have found.  A boy witnesses the destruction of his family, but escapes with the help of a great man who happens to find him and smuggle him from an archaeological site in Poland all the way to Greece.  Traumatized and deeply scarred, the boy grows up in the shadow of the war on a remote island, the man mentoring him in life and languages, surviving  and deeply involved with the community of the villageat great danger to himself.At the close of the war, they move to Canada, where they restart their lives.  Just down the hall, the boy meets some other yiddish-speaking holocaust survivors and together they all form a kind of family.  Though there are plenty of good holocaust films, nowhere have I seen its aftermath so well portrayed.As he grows into an adult, the boy works hard to develop his talents as a writer, but he is tied to the past with an obsession with death, particularly that of his sister, who was dragged off by the Nazis.  In his state of withdrawal, he allows a marriage (sadly a mismatch) to an exuberant beauty to wither and die, though it inspires him to return to Greece and begin a new phase of creative expression in memory and art.  Nothing seems to overcome his introspective melancholy, until he is introduced to someone else and a new phase of his life begins, looking forward rather than backward.  The beauty of this interior journey is a unique achievement.Warmly recommended.  This is art that approaches the complexity of life.",5,explores the true process of healing and growth through love,1288742400,"11 3, 2010",2010,1537,"['***spoiler', 'alert***This', 'extraordinary', 'gem', 'feel', 'lucky', 'have', 'found', 'boy', 'destruction', 'family', 'help', 'great', 'man', 'who', 'find', 'smuggle', 'archaeological', 'site', 'Poland', 'way', 'Greece', 'Traumatized', 'deeply', 'scarred', 'boy', 'up', 'shadow', 'war', 'remote', 'island', 'man', 'mentoring', 'life', 'languages', 'surviving', 'deeply', 'involved', 'community', 'villageat', 'great', 'danger', 'himself.At', 'close', 'war', 'move', 'Canada', 'where', 'restart', 'lives', 'Just', 'hall', 'boy', 'other', 'yiddish-speaking', 'holocaust', 'survivors', 'together', 'form', 'kind', 'family', 'are', 'plenty', 'good', 'holocaust', 'films', 'nowhere', 'have', 'seen', 'aftermath', 'so', 'well', 'adult', 'boy', 'hard', 'develop', 'talents', 'writer', 'tied', 'past', 'obsession', 'death', 'particularly', 'sister', 'who', 'was', 'dragged', 'off', 'Nazis', 'state', 'withdrawal', 'marriage', 'sadly', 'mismatch', 'exuberant', 'beauty', 'wither', 'die', 'return', 'Greece', 'begin', 'new', 'phase', 'creative', 'expression', 'memory', 'art', 'Nothing', 'overcome', 'introspective', 'melancholy', 'introduced', 'someone', 'else', 'new', 'phase', 'life', 'looking', 'forward', 'rather', 'backward', 'beauty', 'interior', 'journey', 'unique', 'achievement.Warmly', 'recommended', 'art', 'complexity', 'life']",Fugitive Pieces
