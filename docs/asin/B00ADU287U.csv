1607800,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B00ADU287U,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[9, 10]","Matthew is an inexperienced gay teen, a byproduct of an evangelical Christian upbringing that instilled guilt and repression as a seeming fact of life for him. A hidden porn magazine is discovered by his best friend, Brandon who turns out to be gay as well. Unfortunately, they are discovered by Matthew's father, who informs Brandon's parents. Matthew is sent away, and the two of them reunite at an ex-gay conversion camp for teens, which they manage to survive and return home. Brandon refuses to lie to his mother about having been ""converted"" to heterosexuality, and is thrown out of his home. Matthew decides to leave with him, and they attempt to put together a life together. They have better luck than most gay teen runaways, but the film makes it clear the risks and perils they face.This is one of the strangest gay films I have ever seen. It addresses the ""gay and Christian"" message on an extremely simplistic level, which I personally feel most viewers would consider a bit condescending.  This ambitious film includes several unexpected animated and musical sequences, likely meant to teach as well as entertain ...  but one can only deal with so many verses of songs like ""Jesus Is In My Pants"" or ""The Dingleberry Song.""  The cute, twinkish couple (played by Aaron Judge and Alex ""Bear City"" DiDio) do a commendable job with dialogue that invites a lot of eye-rolling on the part of the viewer.  However, I did find the frequent explicit sexual dialogue a bit off-putting in a supposed ""message"" film such as this. (There is no full nudity, and this unrated film would be a heavy R due to sexual content, dialogue and simulated sex.)  I got my DVD from Amazon, which is the only place I could find it for sale.Since I'm NOT the ""writer/producer/director/editor"" of this film, my rating varies a bit from the earlier one. :)  It's a commendable effort, but obviously not for everyone.  I'll give it kudos for effort, and three stars out of five.",3,"Very unusual video looks at gay teens, Christianity ... and dingleberrys.",1358380800,"01 17, 2013",2013,1961,"['Matthew', 'inexperienced', 'gay', 'teen', 'byproduct', 'evangelical', 'Christian', 'upbringing', 'instilled', 'guilt', 'repression', 'seeming', 'fact', 'life', 'hidden', 'porn', 'magazine', 'discovered', 'best', 'friend', 'Brandon', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'gay', 'as', 'well', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'discovered', 'Matthew', 'father', 'who', 'Brandon', 'parents', 'Matthew', 'sent', 'away', 'two', 'reunite', 'ex-gay', 'conversion', 'camp', 'teens', 'manage', 'survive', 'return', 'home', 'Brandon', 'lie', 'mother', 'having', 'been', 'converted', 'heterosexuality', 'thrown', 'home', 'Matthew', 'leave', 'attempt', 'put', 'together', 'life', 'together', 'have', 'better', 'luck', 'most', 'gay', 'teen', 'runaways', 'film', 'clear', 'risks', 'perils', 'face.This', 'one', 'strangest', 'gay', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'gay', 'Christian', 'message', 'extremely', 'simplistic', 'level', 'personally', 'feel', 'most', 'viewers', 'would', 'consider', 'bit', 'condescending', 'ambitious', 'film', 'several', 'unexpected', 'animated', 'musical', 'sequences', 'likely', 'meant', 'teach', 'as', 'well', 'entertain', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'deal', 'so', 'many', 'verses', 'songs', 'Jesus', 'Pants', 'Dingleberry', 'Song', 'cute', 'twinkish', 'couple', 'played', 'Aaron', 'Judge', 'Alex', 'Bear', 'City', 'DiDio', 'do', 'commendable', 'job', 'dialogue', 'lot', 'eye-rolling', 'part', 'viewer', 'However', 'did', 'find', 'frequent', 'explicit', 'sexual', 'dialogue', 'bit', 'off-putting', 'supposed', 'message', 'film', 'such', 'full', 'nudity', 'unrated', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'heavy', 'R', 'due', 'sexual', 'content', 'dialogue', 'simulated', 'sex', 'got', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'only', 'place', 'could', 'find', 'sale.Since', ""'m"", 'writer/producer/director/editor', 'film', 'rating', 'bit', 'earlier', 'one', 'commendable', 'effort', 'obviously', 'not', 'everyone', ""'ll"", 'give', 'kudos', 'effort', 'three', 'stars', 'five']",A Heaven for Queers

But because of the cover picture, and a good review I read, I decided to watch it. I do admit that the cartoon aspect was weird, especially the dingleberry one, but I don't think people realize that these cartoons were really a dream sequence for Matthew. While the cartoon aspect was weird, I do think the message that each cartoon/song sequence did tie in with the overall movie theme of being a young newbie to being gay and why there is some degree hesitancy of gay relationships, particularly for someone who has a strong Christian background. Once you get passed the first 30 minutes, it does get better. Matthew and Brandon are good looking guys, and their moments of passion I thought were good. They were childhood friends, and when they were in their late teens, each one realized that the other was gay, and how much they liked each other. Their many years of friendship provided a strong foundation for their romantic relationship that unfolded. I do think that it is a good movie for young gay teens to watch to help them realize being gay is OK, and that being gay is not a sin. It also helps you realize that while many gay relationships are short lived, there are a few where both partners have good moral code of how to treat one another (based on their Christian background), and that you can be both Christian and gay.",4,"Better than I thought, based on other reviews",1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,1415,"['was', 'sort', 'hesitant', 'renting', 'bad', 'reviews', 'cover', 'picture', 'good', 'review', 'read', 'decided', 'watch', 'do', 'admit', 'cartoon', 'aspect', 'was', 'weird', 'especially', 'dingleberry', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'people', 'realize', 'cartoons', 'were', 'really', 'dream', 'sequence', 'Matthew', 'cartoon', 'aspect', 'was', 'weird', 'do', 'think', 'message', 'cartoon/song', 'sequence', 'did', 'tie', 'overall', 'movie', 'theme', 'being', 'young', 'newbie', 'being', 'gay', 'why', 'degree', 'hesitancy', 'gay', 'relationships', 'particularly', 'someone', 'who', 'strong', 'Christian', 'background', 'Once', 'get', 'passed', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'get', 'better', 'Matthew', 'Brandon', 'are', 'good', 'looking', 'guys', 'moments', 'passion', 'thought', 'were', 'good', 'were', 'childhood', 'friends', 'when', 'were', 'late', 'teens', 'one', 'realized', 'other', 'was', 'gay', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'other', 'many', 'years', 'friendship', 'provided', 'strong', 'foundation', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'unfolded', 'do', 'think', 'good', 'movie', 'young', 'gay', 'teens', 'watch', 'help', 'realize', 'being', 'gay', 'OK', 'being', 'gay', 'not', 'sin', 'also', 'realize', 'many', 'gay', 'relationships', 'are', 'short', 'lived', 'are', 'few', 'where', 'partners', 'have', 'good', 'moral', 'code', 'how', 'treat', 'one', 'based', 'Christian', 'background', 'can', 'be', 'Christian', 'gay']",A Heaven for Queers

1607805,A20GQ70AJ9B0NY,B00ADU287U,Lost in Vegas,"[1, 1]","This is an odd movie.  It was shot on a very low budget (evidently) and with a very limited cast and set.  As others here have noted, the first half hour is dreadful but needs to be endured to get to the better part later on.  The actors manage to create an endearing story of young gay male love.  Their strong Christian faith makes the film particularly unusual, as they struggle to understand and embrace their sexual orientation and mutual love and to deal with the harsh voices of certain people in their world.  After a while, the quirkiness of this film starts to make it more fun to watch.  While there are passionate scenes between the main characters and frequent references to sexual activities and body parts, the sex never gets explicit or genital.",3,Odd But Endearing,1404345600,"07 3, 2014",2014,761,"['odd', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'evidently', 'very', 'limited', 'cast', 'set', 'others', 'here', 'have', 'noted', 'first', 'hour', 'dreadful', 'be', 'endured', 'get', 'better', 'part', 'later', 'actors', 'manage', 'create', 'endearing', 'story', 'young', 'gay', 'male', 'love', 'strong', 'Christian', 'faith', 'film', 'particularly', 'unusual', 'struggle', 'understand', 'embrace', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'mutual', 'love', 'deal', 'harsh', 'voices', 'certain', 'people', 'world', 'while', 'quirkiness', 'film', 'make', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'are', 'passionate', 'scenes', 'main', 'characters', 'frequent', 'references', 'sexual', 'activities', 'body', 'parts', 'sex', 'never', 'explicit', 'genital']",A Heaven for Queers

After finishing it, overall, I'm very happy to say, I'm glad I stuck with it! It did get better, its message of respect and tolerance was very good, but the last song didn't seem to add much, other than a dream sequence. The sexual content was more suggested, but the dialogue was somewhat explicit, but still not quite as bad as the first season of qaf. When Brandon fills Matthew in about his current situation and spiritual revelation, I started just balling, not out of sadness, but I felt both of their pain and relieved feeling, ( I had a similar experience just last summer) I never questioned God's love for anyone, although I still find some of his followers hard to respect, but I'm starting to realize: you can love a person without condoning their behavior. This movie isn't for everyone, but depending on how open minded you are, give it a shot, despite some cheesy scripting and some weird scenes, you may be surprised.",4,I didn't like it...at first.,1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,1211,"['30', 'minutes', 'esp', 'dingleberry', '34', 'song-which', 'was', 'rather', 'gross', 'almost', 'gave', 'up', 'trying', 'like', 'made', 'even', 'worse', 'when', 'Matthew', 'dad', 'caught', 'Brandon', 'romantic', 'moment', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'cruel', 'homophobic', 'M.', 'refusing', 'hear', 'out', 'finishing', 'overall', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'say', ""'m"", 'glad', 'stuck', 'did', 'get', 'better', 'message', 'respect', 'tolerance', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'last', 'song', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'add', 'much', 'other', 'dream', 'sequence', 'sexual', 'content', 'was', 'more', 'suggested', 'dialogue', 'was', 'somewhat', 'explicit', 'still', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'bad', 'first', 'season', 'qaf', 'When', 'Brandon', 'Matthew', 'current', 'situation', 'spiritual', 'revelation', 'started', 'just', 'balling', 'not', 'sadness', 'felt', 'pain', 'relieved', 'feeling', 'had', 'similar', 'experience', 'just', 'last', 'summer', 'never', 'questioned', 'God', 'love', 'anyone', 'still', 'find', 'followers', 'hard', 'respect', ""'m"", 'starting', 'realize', 'can', 'love', 'person', 'condoning', 'behavior', 'movie', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'depending', 'how', 'open', 'minded', 'are', 'give', 'shot', 'cheesy', 'scripting', 'weird', 'scenes', 'may', 'be', 'surprised']",A Heaven for Queers
