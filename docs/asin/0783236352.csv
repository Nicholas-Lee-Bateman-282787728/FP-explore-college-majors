66816,A2QJC8A2HN5FWW,0783236352,718 Session,"[4, 5]","In Francois Truffaut's book length interview with Hitchcock, Hitch said that while 1943's ""Shadow of a Doubt"" probably wasn't his best picture, it was his favorite because a thousand little things came together to make it near-effortless and near-perfect.As an example, he refers to one of the first scenes shot: the scene where Uncle Charley's train arrives.  On a bright clear day, the camera gets set up for a simple shot of a steam train pulling into the station.  As soon as the train arrives, though, a gust of wind comes up from behind the train.  All the black smoke that was seeming to float into the sky sweeps down and envelops the platform: Uncle Charley is here!What else adds up to a great picture?  A screenplay written by one of America's greatest playwrights, Thornton Wilder (""Our Town""), a wonderful cast (Theresa Wright, Joseph Cotten, Henry Travers--Clarence from ""It's a Wonderful Life"", Hume Cronyn are all fantastic) a tight plot, and a good score.Others have touched on the plot and the theme of innocence lost.  All I can add is that this film really stands up and that I enjoy it every time I watch it.Considering the movie is almost 60 years old, the DVD transfer is great and from a good print.  The extras are neat.Pick it up!",5,A thousand little things adding up to a wonderful picture,1034553600,"10 14, 2002",2002,1256,"['Francois', 'Truffaut', 'book', 'length', 'interview', 'Hitchcock', 'Hitch', 'said', '1943', 'Shadow', 'Doubt', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'picture', 'was', 'favorite', 'thousand', 'little', 'things', 'came', 'together', 'make', 'near-effortless', 'near-perfect.As', 'example', 'one', 'first', 'scenes', 'shot', 'scene', 'where', 'Uncle', 'Charley', 'train', 'arrives', 'bright', 'clear', 'day', 'camera', 'set', 'up', 'simple', 'shot', 'steam', 'train', 'pulling', 'station', 'As', 'soon', 'train', 'though', 'gust', 'wind', 'up', 'train', 'black', 'smoke', 'was', 'seeming', 'float', 'sky', 'down', 'platform', 'Uncle', 'Charley', 'here', 'What', 'else', 'up', 'great', 'picture', 'screenplay', 'written', 'one', 'America', 'greatest', 'playwrights', 'Thornton', 'Wilder', 'Town', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'Theresa', 'Wright', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'Clarence', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Hume', 'Cronyn', 'are', 'fantastic', 'tight', 'plot', 'good', 'score.Others', 'have', 'touched', 'plot', 'theme', 'innocence', 'lost', 'can', 'add', 'film', 'really', 'up', 'enjoy', 'time', 'watch', 'it.Considering', 'movie', 'almost', '60', 'years', 'old', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'great', 'good', 'print', 'extras', 'are', 'neat.Pick', 'up']",N/A
66817,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0783236352,Acute Observer,"[0, 2]","Shadow of a Doubt, 1943 filmThe film opens on a long-gone city scene: boys are playing baseball in the street with no automobile traffic. A landlady tells a roomer that two gentlemen were looking for him; they said they were friends. He leaves and they follow him. Uncle Charlie decides to visit his relatives in Santa Rosa California. Little Ann gets the message. The steam-powered locomotive pulls into the station to meet the waiting family. All are happy. Uncle Charlie presents a wrist-watch to his banker brother-in-law, a novelty for him. We learn about the family. Charlie gives an emerald ring to his niece, named Charlene after him. His niece now thinks of a tune - ""The Merry Widow Waltz"". This banker has in interest in true crime stories. There is a funny incident with the daily newspaper. Niece Charlie is a sharp observer and figures out the trick. But we see a hidden side of Uncle Charlie.We learn that two men want to interview the family and take their photographs. Uncle Charlie doesn't like that! (He must have left a back trail.) When he visits the bank he makes jokes in poor taste (displaying a contempt for his relatives). Uncle Charlie demands the film after he is accidentally photographed. Niece Charlie figures out the ""reporter"" is a detective, and he tells her about the search for an unknown subject who is a murderer of rich widows! At the dinner table Uncle Charlie shows his contempt for old rich widows. There is an odd discussion about poisoning by a neighbor Herb. Charlie runs off, and Uncle Charlie takes her to a cocktail lounge for a chat. He twists a napkin to symbolize his nervousness and troubled mind. Later niece Charlie is warned by a detective that the photograph was sent east and they could arrest her uncle in two hours. But fresh news points to a solved case, by default. It seems to be over. But new events bring danger from accidents. Uncle Charlie presents a speech, then announces he is being called away on personal business. At the railroad station there is a final chapter to this story. [I found the ending improbable.]Alfred Hitchcock's films often show the horrors that can pop up in everyday life in a small town, or a large city. Crime and violence are mostly suggested, except at the ending. Imagine having a distant relative who was a serial killer? This film presents small town life around 1943. The war is hinted at by the men in uniform. No mention of rationing. It is a forerunner to those TV dramas that portray parents as bumbling fools oblivious to the realities of teen-age life. The discussion about crime (or sports) suggest the censorship that forbids that forbids any mention of politics, the economy, or the unmentionable war. They didn't want to upset their customers.",4,Horror in a Small Town,1255996800,"10 20, 2009",2009,2752,"['Shadow', 'Doubt', '1943', 'filmThe', 'film', 'long-gone', 'city', 'scene', 'boys', 'are', 'playing', 'baseball', 'street', 'automobile', 'traffic', 'landlady', 'roomer', 'two', 'gentlemen', 'were', 'looking', 'said', 'were', 'friends', 'follow', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'visit', 'relatives', 'Santa', 'Rosa', 'California', 'Little', 'Ann', 'message', 'steam-powered', 'locomotive', 'pulls', 'station', 'meet', 'waiting', 'family', 'are', 'happy', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'wrist-watch', 'banker', 'brother-in-law', 'novelty', 'learn', 'family', 'Charlie', 'emerald', 'ring', 'niece', 'named', 'Charlene', 'niece', 'now', 'tune', 'Merry', 'Widow', 'Waltz', 'banker', 'interest', 'true', 'crime', 'stories', 'funny', 'incident', 'daily', 'newspaper', 'Niece', 'Charlie', 'sharp', 'observer', 'out', 'trick', 'see', 'hidden', 'side', 'Uncle', 'Charlie.We', 'learn', 'two', 'men', 'want', 'interview', 'family', 'take', 'photographs', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'like', 'must', 'have', 'left', 'back', 'trail', 'When', 'bank', 'jokes', 'poor', 'taste', 'displaying', 'contempt', 'relatives', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'film', 'accidentally', 'photographed', 'Niece', 'Charlie', 'out', 'reporter', 'detective', 'search', 'unknown', 'subject', 'who', 'murderer', 'rich', 'widows', 'dinner', 'table', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'contempt', 'old', 'rich', 'odd', 'discussion', 'poisoning', 'neighbor', 'Herb', 'Charlie', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'cocktail', 'lounge', 'chat', 'napkin', 'symbolize', 'nervousness', 'troubled', 'mind', 'Later', 'niece', 'Charlie', 'warned', 'detective', 'photograph', 'was', 'sent', 'east', 'could', 'arrest', 'uncle', 'two', 'hours', 'fresh', 'news', 'points', 'solved', 'case', 'default', 'be', 'new', 'events', 'bring', 'danger', 'accidents', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'speech', 'then', 'being', 'called', 'away', 'personal', 'business', 'railroad', 'station', 'final', 'chapter', 'story', '[', 'found', 'ending', 'improbable', ']', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'often', 'show', 'horrors', 'can', 'pop', 'up', 'everyday', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'large', 'city', 'Crime', 'violence', 'are', 'mostly', 'suggested', 'ending', 'Imagine', 'having', 'distant', 'relative', 'who', 'was', 'serial', 'killer', 'film', 'small', 'town', 'life', '1943', 'war', 'hinted', 'men', 'uniform', 'mention', 'rationing', 'forerunner', 'TV', 'dramas', 'portray', 'parents', 'bumbling', 'fools', 'oblivious', 'realities', 'teen-age', 'life', 'discussion', 'crime', 'sports', 'suggest', 'censorship', 'forbids', 'mention', 'politics', 'economy', 'unmentionable', 'war', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'upset', 'customers']",N/A
66818,AQCAWDBNNUS1E,0783236352,A. J. Sneed,"[0, 0]","Hitchcock delivers suspense in the meticulous style that would become his trademark.  Brilliant casting and writing make this thriller one of Hitchcock's most memorable. The  plot and characters have been well-decscribed  in other reviews, and I would only add some things about the film that stand out for me:I especially liked how Hitchcock  uses mundane details of middle-class American life and manners to create ambiance and tone. The location shooting in Shadow of a Doubt was still not yet common at this time in Hollywood film: from the gritty opening street scenes in Newark( representing Philadelphia) to the idyllic small town of Santa Rosa, Hitchcock uses the locations as well as any studio set. Look at the extras and scenery and how people dress and walk, all captured seamlessly by Hitchcock as part of the story.Small touches of humor abound like the early scene at home with the bookworm younger sister lying on the floor, and reading a book while eating an apple; and then putting her half-eaten apple on the carpeted floor while she goes to answer the phone. Or Mrs Newton earnestly explaining about mixing ingredients for a cake to an exasperated detective masquerading as a pollster.Also, listen  carefully to the dialoque, particularly at the Newton household with people talking over each other. And, trailing conversations that often come from out of camera shot which adds to the genuine feeling of family life with its informality and bustle of children.I could go on and on as there are so many different aspects about this film to enjoy.

Place them in middle class Santa Rosa California in the 1940's and surround them with a very conventional family and you can take it from there.

And watching it, it's hard to argue. ""Shadow Of A Doubt"" defines Hitcock perfectly: drak, creepy, filled with black humor and more than twists and turns that a state intersection. It's not the masterpiece that ""Vertigo, ""North By Northwest"" and ""Psycho"" are, but ""Shadow Of A Doubt"" is in the upper echelon of Hitchcock movies.The film's plot goes something like this. Uncle Charlie (Jospeh Cotton) is the notorious Merry Widow Murderer, elduing the law by travelling from Phildelphia to California. He visits the town of Santa Rosa to pay a visit to his family. They are thrilled to see him, especially his niece and namesake, ""Young Charlie"" (Teresa Wright). Once there, Charlie turns on the charm, never hinting once at his sadistic, homicidal alter ego. However, when cops begin to suspect charlie of being the MWM, so does his neice. What she uncovers is a deadly secret that could prove deadly for her. It leads up to a startling locomotive climac that is one of the best sequences in a Hitchcock movie.""Shadow Of A Doubt"" is an excellent movie. As I said earlier, it is easy to see why this Hitchcock's favorite movie. It defines what he is all about. The acting is superb as well. Joseph Cotton is perfectly creepy and charming as the elusive Uncle Charlie, and Teresa Wright plays Young Charlie with a finesse missing from ost of today's young atresses. The supporting cast (including Hume Cronyn in an early role) adds nice support to the cast as wwell.As with most Hitchcock dvds, the extras are amazingly enjoyable.

66824,AORW1FRF4D4KS,0783236352,azindn,"[4, 7]","A film of subtleties and evil in plain sight, Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt is a slow moving character study of young ""Charlie,"" the namesake niece of elegant but sinister uncle Charles.  Formerly of Philadelphia, his visit to a younger sister in California is the kind of long visit by a relative everyone dreads in hindsight. Situated and contrasted by the light and seeming perfect American middle class small town of Petaluma, suave Charles Oakley (Joseph Cotten) is all fine suits and manners of a bachelor gentleman.Wholesome Theresa Wright is ""Young Charlie,"" an average, and purposeless young woman whose guileless world has bored her by its failure to have meaning, although she is the cause. As a member of a family where everyone talks over one another without heeding, the kids prattle, the wife babbles, and the family's men persist in mindless discussions over how to plot a murder effectively as family dinner conversation, somehow this oddness is translated as the norm in Hitchcock's interpretation of small town America. It is a film of many dialogues, however, only one voice is audible without interruption: Uncle Charles. His dinner table monologue is most menacing as he describes the ""useless, fat, women"" who he sees as less than human and deserving of death. Until this moment, young Charlie had idolized her uncle until doubt is created by a detective played by MacDonald Cary.  One of two detectives on a national hunt for the ""Merry Widow"" serial murderer, they have tracked the suspicious Uncle Charles across country to his unsuspecting sister's home and family. Once the seeds of doubt are sown, Charlie's dreamlike idealization of her perfect uncle and his world becomes shattered by her suspicion. Charlie no longer can fantasize about her dreamy uncle who she has erotic longings that can never be consummated. Once he realizes his charade is over, Uncle Charles rips away the curtain of sleepwalking in Charlie's perfect world with terrible  consequence.  The perfect world is not a nice place as Charlie's revelation is made all the more grusome through her uncle's warped eyes. As the evil grows more apparent, Charlie attempts to shield her storybook family by keeping them ignorant of his murderous past, but is it at a cost to her own happiness and life?Hitchcock acknowledged the film was his personal favorite and it defines the notions of suspense, noir, and thriller without blood or visual carnage. A literate script by Thorton Wilder (Our Town) alludes to violence that is only suggested never seen.  Through the physical presence of the brilliant character actor, Joseph Cotton (Citizen Kane, Portrait of Jennie), the menace and diabolic threat to the snow white, virginal Theresa Wright is alluded in eye, body language, and especially his hands. Sophisticated and cerebral, Hitch was playing with audiences creating a masterpiece of normalcy and idealized family values under a looming presence that cast a shadow of a doubt.

66827,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,0783236352,Bobby Underwood,"[9, 12]","Teresa Wright truly shines in Hitchcock's tale of darkness and evil coming to stay in Santa Rosa, California. A story by Gordon McDonnell was adapted for the screen by Thorton Wilder, Alma Reville, and Sally Benson and this slice of Americana is played out perfectly by a wonderful cast.Teresa Wright is the bored young daughter of Emma (Patricia Collinge) and Joseph (Henry Travers) Newton. Life for her in the small town of Santa Rosa has become boring for the wholesome American girl. Wright's ""Charlie"" is the picture of lovely innocence that matches her small town.The change she desires to shake things up comes to town in the form of her namesake, Uncle Charle (Joseph Cotten). Hitchcock has shown the audience that something is not quite right for the charming Uncle Charlie, however. But the special bond between he and Charlie will not be broken easily. Their unusual connection is explored in the happy and charming moments after Cotten's arrival.Charlie's adoration of her uncle borders on a crush and leaves her open and vulnerable to anything Charlie wants. Hitchcock creates some almost uncomfortable scenes as you get the feeling any moment Cotton might just take the smiling and adoring Charlie in his arms and kiss her. And Charlie might remain passive if he were to do so, unsure of her feelings.But strange behavior in her uncle and the attentions of a government agent after him who falls in love with her will change everything and break Uncle Charlie's spell, revealing a warped and twisted view of the world. The tune he whistles is the key to what Charlie has become in the years he has been absent.Hume Cronyn steals every scene he is in as Joseph's good pal and mystery lover, Herbie. Their long talks on the porch as the two attempt to devise the perfect murder plays in humorous contrast to the real evil right under their noses. Even once Charlie knows about her uncle she can not tell and destroy her weak mother. But she has Agent Jack Graham's (Macdonald Carey) number and may have to use it when Uncle Charlie realizes the only thing standing between he and the gallows is young Charlie.This is both a beautiful portrait of small-town America and a suspenseful thriller. Cotten underplays his role to marvelous effect and Teresa Wright is simply wonderful in this Hitchcock masterpiece.

The casual film fan will know him for titles like ""Psycho,"" ""The Birds,"" ""North By Northwest,"" and ""Vertigo,"" which actually were four of his last films.  His most prolific period was in the 1930s and 1940s, when he directed about half of his films.  ""Shadow Of a Doubt"" is not the most famous even of this period, but there is no better example of his work.  For those familiar with this film and interested in an excellent, detailed analysis of same, see [...]  (I am not connected with that site in any way.)Hitchcock excelled at injecting menace into commonplace objects and settings, and his use of shadows, camera angles, and music was often inventive and later imitated.  It's a joy to the sophisticated viewer to see his work in ""Shadow Of a Doubt"" in this regard, but without a ripping good tale to tell it's just academics.  The screenplay here was provided mainly by celebrated playwright Thornton Wilder, and the central character of Young Charlie is played by Teresa Wright, an actress who is these days as sadly overlooked as this film itself.  She appears in almost every scene, so obviously Hitchcock trusted her talents immensely, and it paid off in a terrific performance that runs the gamut of emotions and situations.  Wright is the only actress or actor to have ever been Oscar nominated for each of her first three films, including Best Supporting winner for ""Mrs. Miniver.""Joseph Cotten plays the bad guy, Uncle Charlie, and boy is he a bad guy.  If you've not seen this film, I hope you can ignore the details of the story and let the master of suspense slowly clue you in as the film rolls on.  What Uncle Charlie is guilty of, what his secret is, etc., are best left hidden, so don't read other reviews.  Let me just say that if you enjoy Hitchcock films, stop right now and get to a copy of ""Shadow Of a Doubt"" right away.  You'll love it.Also it's fun to see a young Hume Cronyn in his film debut, and Henry Travers (James Stewart's guardian angel Clarence in ""It's a Wonderful Life"") as the dad.

66831,A2CZPM110DW516,0783236352,"Brian W. Fairbanks ""Brian W. Fairbanks""","[0, 0]","Alfred Hitchcock was in the grave long before the DVD era, so there is no director's commentary on ""Shadow of a Doubt,"" but ""Beyond Doubt,"" a documentary about the making of the film included in this edition, offers enlightenment.Patricia Hitchcock, the director's daughter, confirms that ""Shadow of a Doubt"" was her father's favorite film. He got a kick out of introducing evil into a peaceful small town. Did Hitchcock agree with the villain, Uncle Charlie, when he characterizes his adoring niece as someone who dreams her ""peaceful stupid dreams"" and knows nothing of the real world which he calls a ""hell""?Uncle Charlie regards those who live in small towns with borderline contempt, thinking they are naive and stupid, unaware of the horrors beyond the white picket fences that surround their homes. But Hitchcock and Thornton Wilder may be suggesting that big city sophisticates like Uncle Charlie secretly resent those who are content to devote their lives to their homes and communities, and are not burdened by the ambition that drives others to seek gratification for their lusts and egos in the more hectic and probably life-shortening environment of the cities. Before television and other forms of mass media invaded rural areas and helped stamp out independent thought and conscience, those who dwelled in remote, slow-paced areas were less susceptible to ideas that challenged their values.It is the contrasts between cynical Uncle Charlie and his pure at heart niece, Young Charlie, that makes ""Shadow of a Doubt"" so fascinating and worthy of repeated viewings. Uncle Charlie mocks religion in a scene in which his niece returns from Sunday church services, asking his niece if the congregation has gotten smaller. After all, the ""show"" has been running so long at that point, he wonders if it can still attract much of an audience. There was a full house, she replies, a look of satisfaction on her face at having proved her once beloved uncle wrong.""Shadow of a Doubt"" is ultimately about the battle of good and evil as it is played out in our own backyards and living rooms. The two Charlies may be, as Uncle Charlie says, ""twins,"" but they're still opposites.But though ""Shadow of a Doubt"" was Hitchcock's favorite of his films (and it's one of my favorites, too), it's still better in parts than as a whole, and misses the mark as an example of absolutely top-flight Hitchcock. Part of the problem is in the casting.Teresa Wright is wonderful as Young Charlie, and Joseph Cotton is delightfully cynical as her murderous Uncle. Henry Travers, the angel of ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" as Young Charlie's banker father who relaxes by swapping murder plots with a shy neighbor played by Hume Cronyn, is fun, as Cronyn is himself in his film debut.The rest of the supporting cast leaves something to be desired, though. MacDonald Carey is a smug bore as the detective on Uncle Charlie's trail, and Wallace Ford isn't any more appealing as his partner. Patricia Collidge as Young Charlie's mother and, of course, Uncle Charlie's sister, has a wide-eyed stare that suggests foolishness even if she's only attempting to appear gullible, and Edna May Wonacott as the bespectacled book reading younger sister, is too much the wind-up doll, a little too smart and condescending, a template for the unconvincingly wise children in Steven Spielberg's later films.Then there's the waitress in the nightclub that Uncle Charlie forces his niece into visiting after he follows her when she storms out of the house in a rage. Played by Janet Shaw, she has a sleepy indifference that seems meant to suggest that she's defeated by life. That's fine, but the film suggests that working as a waitress in a bar is an example of having been thorougly corrupted. It's the last stop on the train to Hell. It's a fairly laughable portrayal, not unlike the way other films of the era depicted librarians as sexless spinsters whose emotions were as tightly controlled as the buns in their hair. There is a librarian in ""Shadow of a Doubt,"" but she strays from that mold just a bit because of her age which I would guess to around 60.""Shadow of a Doubt"" is very worthwhile regardless. The writing, credited to Thornton Wilder, Sally Benson, and Hitchcock's wife Alma Reville, but with input from the director, is generally outstanding, and, when it comes to Cotton's speech (what Peter Bogdanovich calls the villain's ""position papers""), quite shocking.Brian W.

Taylor,"[2, 16]","Alfred Hitchcock said that this was his favorite among his films but, after having seen it for the third or fourth time, I still cannot see why. Hitchcock often stated in interviews that his greatest enjoyment in making films was the working out of the details beforehand and that he often wished he didn't have to actually make the picture.  This film and some of his others, particularly in the writing and acting departments, clearly demonstrate that.Joseph Cotten's performance as ""Uncle Charlie"" is wooden and even the dinner conversation about the fat widows ""eating the money and drinking the money"" of their dead husbands  lacks conviction.  Patricia Collinge, superb in ""The Little Foxes"" of 1941, is merely annoying here given the inane lines she is burdened with.  Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn ""humorously"" and endlessly discussing different types of murder is silly.  Worst of all are the fatal performances of the two child actors portraying Teresa Wright's younger sister and  brother who manage to drag down every scene they appear in.  All these are things Mr. Hitchcock should not have allowed to get away from him, especially when one considers the excellence of earlier pictures such as ""Rebecca"" and ""Foreign Correspondent"".The scenes involving the missing newspaper page, Teresa Wright's race to get to the library before it closes and her close call with asphyxiation, all intended to generate great suspense, tend to fall flat.  This picture betrays the same weaknesses as ""Saboteur"", made the year before for the same studio.  The same weaknesses in acting and writing also show up, but to a lesser extent, in ""Spellbound"", ""Rope"", ""I Confess""  and ""Stage Fright"" the last of which is saved only by the droll performance of Alastair Sim.Alfred Hitchcock really comes into his own in the early 1950's beginning with ""Strangers on a Train"" (1951) and ending with ""The Birds"" (1961) -- films which comprise a body of work that has deservedly won praise from movie-lovers throughout the world.",2,"""Shadow of a Doubt"" Weak Hitchcock",1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,2014,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'said', 'was', 'favorite', 'films', 'having', 'seen', 'third', 'fourth', 'time', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'why', 'Hitchcock', 'often', 'stated', 'interviews', 'greatest', 'enjoyment', 'making', 'films', 'was', 'working', 'details', 'beforehand', 'often', 'wished', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'actually', 'make', 'picture', 'film', 'others', 'particularly', 'writing', 'acting', 'departments', 'clearly', 'demonstrate', 'that.Joseph', 'Cotten', 'performance', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'wooden', 'even', 'dinner', 'conversation', 'fat', 'eating', 'money', 'drinking', 'money', 'dead', 'husbands', 'conviction', 'Patricia', 'Collinge', 'superb', 'Little', 'Foxes', '1941', 'merely', 'annoying', 'here', 'given', 'inane', 'lines', 'burdened', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'Hume', 'Cronyn', 'humorously', 'endlessly', 'discussing', 'different', 'types', 'murder', 'silly', 'Worst', 'are', 'fatal', 'performances', 'two', 'child', 'actors', 'portraying', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'younger', 'sister', 'brother', 'who', 'manage', 'drag', 'down', 'scene', 'appear', 'are', 'things', 'Mr.', 'Hitchcock', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'allowed', 'get', 'away', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'excellence', 'earlier', 'pictures', 'such', 'Rebecca', 'Foreign', 'Correspondent', '.The', 'scenes', 'involving', 'missing', 'newspaper', 'page', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'race', 'get', 'library', 'close', 'call', 'asphyxiation', 'intended', 'generate', 'great', 'suspense', 'tend', 'fall', 'flat', 'picture', 'same', 'Saboteur', 'made', 'year', 'same', 'studio', 'same', 'weaknesses', 'acting', 'writing', 'also', 'show', 'up', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Spellbound', 'Rope', 'Confess', 'Stage', 'Fright', 'last', 'saved', 'only', 'droll', 'performance', 'Alastair', 'Sim.Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'really', 'own', 'early', '1950', 'beginning', 'Strangers', 'Train', '1951', 'ending', 'Birds', '1961', 'films', 'comprise', 'body', 'work', 'deservedly', 'won', 'praise', 'movie-lovers', 'world']",N/A

So, unlike the Blu-ray reissue of Psycho that came out a couple of years ago, which WAS a complete remaster (and spectacularly done, too!), this one looks great, but no better really than a recent DVD version that uses a transfer of the remaster done in the last ten years or so. I also believe the extras on the Blu-ray are the same as the ones on the Masterpiece Collection DVD, so that might be another reason to hold off for a bit on purchasing it, unless you don't already have it, of course...Having said all that, I bought it anyway and will have the DVD as a back up.

Among the reasons why I like it...--Theresa Wright gave an extraordinary performance as Young Charlie, immensely sympathetic and appealing. I rate hers as the best acting job by a female lead in any of Hitchock's films, including those by Bergman, Kelly, et al.--It was a perfect role for Cotten, an actor I like, who had charm, attractiveness, but to me always seemed a little weak. I thought the role, however psychopathic, suited his personality.--The murder by-play at the family dinner table was great fun and played off Uncle Charlie's real murderousness.--The slowly building knowledge that Young Charlie was realizing the truth about the uncle she idolized and the knowledge that no one would believe her.--The slowly building realization that despite the affection Uncle Charlie had for Young Charlie, he probably was going to do her harm.--The affection that Hitchcock shows toward comfortable small town America. It's an idealization, but without condescension. And because he plays it straight, he makes Uncle Charlie's philosophy of life seem all the more unsettling.--The script was, I think, one of the best written and tightest Hitchcock ever worked with.There's no mystery. We know Uncle Charlie is a killer. The movie is about how Young Charlie and Uncle Charlie are going to resolve their problem as they circle around each other. Hitchcock creates an increasingly unsettling atmosphere, using gentle humor as a foil, and with a person, Young Charlie, it's easy to care about.The DVD transfer is very good.",5,One of Hitchcock's Greatest Films,1096070400,"09 25, 2004",2004,1574,"['Shadow', 'Doubt', 'favorite', 'Hitchock', 'movie', 'reasons', 'why', 'Theresa', 'Wright', 'gave', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'Young', 'Charlie', 'immensely', 'sympathetic', 'appealing', 'rate', 'hers', 'best', 'acting', 'job', 'female', 'lead', 'Hitchock', 'films', 'including', 'Bergman', 'Kelly', 'et', 'al.', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'Cotten', 'actor', 'like', 'who', 'had', 'charm', 'attractiveness', 'always', 'seemed', 'little', 'weak', 'thought', 'role', 'however', 'psychopathic', 'suited', 'personality.', 'murder', 'by-play', 'family', 'dinner', 'table', 'was', 'great', 'fun', 'played', 'off', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'real', 'murderousness.', 'slowly', 'building', 'knowledge', 'Young', 'Charlie', 'was', 'realizing', 'truth', 'uncle', 'idolized', 'knowledge', 'one', 'would', 'believe', 'her.', 'slowly', 'building', 'realization', 'affection', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'had', 'Young', 'Charlie', 'probably', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'harm.', 'affection', 'Hitchcock', 'comfortable', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'idealization', 'condescension', 'straight', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'philosophy', 'life', 'seem', 'more', 'unsettling.', 'script', 'was', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'written', 'tightest', 'Hitchcock', 'ever', 'worked', 'mystery', 'know', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'killer', 'movie', 'how', 'Young', 'Charlie', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'are', 'going', 'resolve', 'problem', 'circle', 'other', 'Hitchcock', 'increasingly', 'unsettling', 'atmosphere', 'using', 'gentle', 'humor', 'foil', 'person', 'Young', 'Charlie', 'easy', 'care', 'about.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'very', 'good']",N/A
66842,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,0783236352,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[86, 94]","Having just watched Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt (1943) last night for the first time, I was surprised at how good it was, and why I've never seen it before.  I mean, I am a fan of Hitchcock, and I've seen many of his movies, but to have heard so little of this particular film seems puzzling to me, as it's an excellent film, and worthy of a lot more recognition than it seems to have gotten.  Either that or I just need to get out of my cookie jar more often...Anyway, the film, directed by Alfred Hitchcock and written by Thornton Wilder, stars a wonderful cast including Teresa Wright, who appeared with Gary Cooper the previous year in The Pride of the Yankees (1942), Joseph Cotten (Citizen Kane, The Third Man), and Henry Travers (High Sierra, Mrs. Miniver, It's a Wonderful Life).  Also making an appearance is Hume Cronyn making his film debut in a supporting role as a mousy neighbor.The story involves a family in a small California town, and the impending arrival of a relative, Charlie (Cotten), from back east.  Most anticipatory is younger Charlie (Wright), named after her uncle, as she feels a deep, almost telepathic connection to this man she hasn't seen in quite awhile.  Now, before Charlie's departure for California, we get a general sense of unease, as it seems Charlie is involved in something of a sinister nature.  Upon arriving in California, the visit seems to be going well, as the family welcomes him with open arms, but soon we learn that trouble has followed Charlie in the form of two rather shady individuals who present themselves with a certain amount of deception, which is elaborated on later.  The older Charlie's behavior begins to change subtly, perceptible only to the younger Charlie and us, the audience.  As various bits of information are disseminated, the younger Charlie's begins to realize that her uncle may harbor a terrible secret that could tear apart the very fabric of her family.  As her uncle's slick veneer is slowly peeled away, she eventually learns the truth, with the older Charlie realizing that the relative safety he sought in coming to stay with his sister and her family is in jeopardy.  What lengths will he go to to protect himself from his past?The film starts out very slowly, but it's obviously deliberate, as the sense of dread within the viewer is cultivated in meticulous fashion.  This seems a common tactic with Hitchcock, but I did get the feeling it was more drawn out here than in most of his other films.  The pacing felt very similar to Rebecca, another Hitchcock film, which was released in 1940, but while that film had a much more grandiose feel to it, this film keeps things fairly simple, which really works well.  There is a good amount of leaving the viewer in the dark within the first hour or so of the film, but when the secrets of the character is revealed, the plot points prior to this fall into place nicely, making sense of these once less meaningful elements.  Teresa Wright's character is wonderful as the perceptive and intelligent niece forced to make a very difficult decision between her family and her uncle, trying to deal with the consequences of whatever path she chooses.  Cotten is the real standout performance in the film, presenting a very likeable character, with a highly polished exterior, but an exterior you learn is barely hiding a very ugly and, ultimately, dangerous core.  He figuratively becomes the fox in the hen house, as his sinister nature encroaches upon this quiet, unassuming community.  As I said before, the pacing is pretty slow, picking up moderately within the last 30 minutes (it has a running time of 108 minutes) to a very suitable and satisfying ending, one that provides a nice jolt during an already tense scene.The print provided by Universal for this release looks very good, despite a few hardly noticeable signs of age and wear.  Special features include a featurette on the making of the film, detailing why Hitchcock considered this to be one of his favorite movies he made, production notes, drawings and photographs, recommendations (to other Hitchcock films), and a theatrical trailer for the film.  All in all, and excellent, if underrated, Hitchcock classic.Cookieman108",5,"Charlie, think.

66844,A39AWL2FKWDFK6,0783236352,Cory D. Slipman,"[2, 3]","""Shadow of a Doubt"", directed by the masterful Alfred Hitchcock ranks extremely high among the vast array of his most well received films.  Featuring an excellent screenplay by Thornton Wilder, a well conceived musical score by Dimitri Tiomkin, some typically outstanding camera work and convincing acting performances the film has few rivals to its lofty stature in this genre.An eerie Joseph Cotten, impressive in this signature role, playing debonair bachelor Charles Oakley is being pursued, presumably by the authorities.  To escape the heat he decides to visit his older sister and her family in the idyllic small California town of Santa Rosa and telegraphs them of his arrival.  This is just the tonic for his adroit and virginal niece and namesake Charlie played by Teresa Wright.  She'd been feeling morose and a visit from her beloved Uncle Charlie instantly elevated her spirits.Uncle Charlie's arrival is a highly anticipated event. He comes bearing presents to the family but with a sketchy and sometimes volatile demeanor.  Wright is given an emerald ring which has an inscription in it with the letters T.S..  Tying this in with an article in the local papers, she suspects that Uncle Charlie might actually be the celebrated and notorious ""Merry Widow"" murderer.The family is put under surveillance by a team of detectives including Macdonald Carey playing Det. Jack Graham, who are part of a nationwide manhunt.  Cotten's behavior keeps getting more and more suspicious and he finally reveals the truth to Wright that he is the strangler of three rich widows.  He makes her promise not to tell but she implores him to leave Santa Rosa.After a series of accidents befall Wright, orchestrated by Cotten, she becomes determined to expose the cunning and dangerous Uncle Charlie to Carey who has become her love interest.Hitchcock's climax is both gripping and unexpected and a perfect compliment to this somewhat under appreciated classic film.  Both Cotten and Wright are terrific in their respective roles.  A strong supporting cast led by Hume Cronyn playing omnipresent neighbor Herbie Hawkins and Henry Travers and Patrica Collinge playing Mr. and Mrs. Newton, Wright's parents add a nice touch.",5,"Superb, timeless Hitchcock classic",1135036800,"12 20, 2005",2005,2215,"['Shadow', 'Doubt', 'directed', 'masterful', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'extremely', 'high', 'vast', 'array', 'most', 'well', 'received', 'films', 'Featuring', 'excellent', 'screenplay', 'Thornton', 'Wilder', 'well', 'conceived', 'musical', 'score', 'Dimitri', 'Tiomkin', 'typically', 'outstanding', 'camera', 'work', 'convincing', 'acting', 'performances', 'film', 'few', 'rivals', 'lofty', 'stature', 'genre.An', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'impressive', 'signature', 'role', 'playing', 'debonair', 'bachelor', 'Charles', 'Oakley', 'being', 'pursued', 'presumably', 'authorities', 'escape', 'heat', 'visit', 'older', 'sister', 'family', 'idyllic', 'small', 'California', 'town', 'Santa', 'Rosa', 'telegraphs', 'arrival', 'just', 'tonic', 'adroit', 'virginal', 'niece', 'namesake', 'Charlie', 'played', 'Teresa', 'Wright', ""'d"", 'been', 'feeling', 'morose', 'visit', 'beloved', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'instantly', 'elevated', 'spirits.Uncle', 'Charlie', 'arrival', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'event', 'bearing', 'presents', 'family', 'sketchy', 'sometimes', 'volatile', 'demeanor', 'Wright', 'given', 'emerald', 'ring', 'inscription', 'letters', 'T.S..', 'Tying', 'article', 'local', 'papers', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'celebrated', 'notorious', 'Merry', 'Widow', 'murderer.The', 'family', 'put', 'surveillance', 'team', 'detectives', 'including', 'Macdonald', 'Carey', 'playing', 'Det', 'Jack', 'Graham', 'who', 'are', 'part', 'nationwide', 'manhunt', 'Cotten', 'behavior', 'keeps', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'suspicious', 'finally', 'truth', 'Wright', 'strangler', 'three', 'rich', 'widows', 'promise', 'not', 'tell', 'leave', 'Santa', 'Rosa.After', 'series', 'accidents', 'befall', 'Wright', 'orchestrated', 'Cotten', 'determined', 'expose', 'cunning', 'dangerous', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'Carey', 'who', 'become', 'love', 'interest.Hitchcock', 'climax', 'gripping', 'unexpected', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'somewhat', 'appreciated', 'classic', 'film', 'Cotten', 'Wright', 'are', 'terrific', 'respective', 'roles', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'led', 'Hume', 'Cronyn', 'playing', 'omnipresent', 'neighbor', 'Herbie', 'Hawkins', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'Patrica', 'Collinge', 'playing', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Newton', 'Wright', 'parents', 'add', 'nice', 'touch']",N/A
66845,A2WFLPOH43G4V9,0783236352,Damon Navas-Howard,"[0, 2]","""Shadow of a Doubt"" is one of my favorite of Hitchcock's early films. It often does not get the praise it deserves. Here we see the early workings of ideas and themes Hitchcock expressed better in his later work. ""Shadow of a Doubt"" explores the merging of good and evil to the point where it is hard to tell which is which. Like the criminals in modern times, they seduce their victims with charm and lead them to believe that they are a perfectly good human bening but behind their mask lies their true evil nature. ""Shadow of a Doubt"" is about an uncle who comes to visit his family in the town of Santa Rosa(Filmed in my hometown!) He seems to be a very good man but Hitchcock slowly gives us hints that he is in some kind of trouble or has done something he doesn't want his family to find out.

In fact the theme of the killer masquerading as a suave, likeable gent was a first for cinema---and Hitchcock was the innovator of this theme which would be repeated many times later in other films. Although one reviewer complained that the identity of the ""Merry Widow"" killer is revealed earlier in the film--I believe was Hitchcock was wise in letting us in on it because what was suspenseful about the film was how far the killer would go to conceal his identity--and to what extent he would do to kill his niece.  Joseph Cotton would never have a role like this with so much psychological depth and Teresa Wright, who recently passed on, was perfectly suited as the heroine who knows the ugly truth. Also the literate screenplay by Thorton Wilder also added to make this a screen classic--no wonder Hitchcock listed this as his favorite American film.",5,Hitchcock's noir classic deserves to be seen,1258156800,"11 14, 2009",2009,1074,"['Shadow', 'A', 'Doubt', 'be', 'ranked', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'Vertigo', 'Psycho', 'Rear', 'Window', 'North', 'Northwest', 'Strangers', 'Train', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'argumentable', 'fact', 'theme', 'killer', 'masquerading', 'suave', 'likeable', 'gent', 'was', 'first', 'cinema', '-and', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'innovator', 'theme', 'would', 'be', 'repeated', 'many', 'times', 'later', 'other', 'films', 'one', 'reviewer', 'complained', 'identity', 'Merry', 'Widow', 'killer', 'revealed', 'earlier', 'film', 'believe', 'was', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'wise', 'letting', 'what', 'was', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'far', 'killer', 'would', 'go', 'conceal', 'identity', 'what', 'extent', 'would', 'do', 'kill', 'niece', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'role', 'so', 'much', 'psychological', 'depth', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'who', 'recently', 'passed', 'was', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'heroine', 'who', 'ugly', 'truth', 'Also', 'literate', 'screenplay', 'Thorton', 'Wilder', 'also', 'added', 'make', 'screen', 'classic', 'wonder', 'Hitchcock', 'listed', 'favorite', 'American', 'film']",N/A

Just one year earlier Wright shined in ""Pride of the Yankees"" and shortly after this film she would win everyone's heart for her role in ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" Cotten was a mainstay in Orson Welles' players, had just finished ""Citizen Kane"" and ""The Magnificent Ambersons,"" and was at the top of his game. So what went wrong? Difficult to know. For one thing, the masculine hero, Macdonald Carey, is relatively weak. So we're left with Wright, who was a great actress, but as the heroine and prime mover, she's not awe inspiring (Hitchcock would find his tough female stars years later in Tippi Hedron, Grace Kelly, and Doris Day).(BTW - Wright got her big break in the Broadway production of Thornton Wilder's ""Our Town"". Wilder was the writer for this film and convinced Hitch to use Wright. The film itself was, according to Hitch, a negative image of Wilder's ""Our Town"" so the placement of Wright in both was ironic)Hitchcock is an acquired taste, and many of his signature techniques that worked so well in other movies are missing here (e.g., the unusual photographic angles, the average day things that take on a menacing purpose). Indeed, Hitchcock only begins to show his great form in 1944's ""Lifeboat"" and then in the 1950s (""Rear Window"", ""Dial M for Murder"", ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"") when, IMHO, his best films were made.In summary this is an interesting film from the point of view of Hitchcock's development as a director, but as a stand alone film, it really doesn't have much to recommend it.

Alfred Hitchcock, 1943, 108 minutes) is a film that will look a bit differently to anybody who watches it. In brief, it is set in 1941, when serial killer Charles Oakley (Joseph Cotton) returns home (on the lam) to his sister and her family in Santa Rosa, California. There he has a somewhat long-in-the-tooth niece also named Charlie (the ever-annoying Teresa Wright) who is mentally imbalanced and believes she has a psychic connection to her Uncle Charlie.In short, Hitchcock simply wanted to make us squirm by showing the quasi-incestuous possibilities that existed in the relationship. That tricky old Hitch!Of course in that time, it was possible for an unidentified serial killer to run loose without anyone hearing of it ... I guess, because that is what Hitchcock wants us to believe. He also seems to be happy with two dopey ""detectives"" who are chasing (or rather, stupidly shadowing) Uncle Charlie. Did otherwise mysterious ""detectives"" really chase suspects like that back then?Naturally obnoxious niece Charlie discovers her Uncle Charlie fairly quickly, and an inner struggle ensues. Should she turn him over, should she warn him? What would you do if this terrible scenario happened to you? It doesn't take long for Uncle Charlie to reveal his twisted hand: he'll simply kill his know-it-all niece.While I go at some of these films a bit harshly, I think one can understand why I do it. SHADOW is brilliant in many places, but Hitchcock at this stage is still trying too hard; he doesn't have his other characters quite right, can't get the shots he clearly wants and the ones that work come off rather stilted. A far cry from the inscrutable perfection of his slightly later films likeRopeandVertigo.Anyone who is a student of cinema, Hitchcock or suspense must have this film. It is not a favorite of mine, which is why I just remembered to review it even though I've seen it a few times since childhood. Frankly there are far better offerings from this era, which was a difficult one in Hollywood anyway. If one compares this to almost anything from the mid-1930s, for example, the 1930s will come up the winner every time, and with good reason.Still, Hitchcock shows us his genius even here: this is a film that had a massive impact on later crime drama films, especially on television. There is a kind of rumor, unconfirmed, that this film inspired Akira Kurosawa greatly but I really don't see it. It always seemed to me more like Hitchcock was deeply inspired by Kurosawa.",3,"""See how they looked at you?

66861,A2BPDFR58H9575,0783236352,Galina,"[2, 3]","*** This comment may contain spoilers ***""Shadow of a Doubt"" (1943), the story of a serial murderer as a loving uncle is the movie which Hitchcock himself had declared as his favorite. This movie is quite a departure from Hitchcock's previous Hollywood productions. For the first half, it is an intimate family dramedy that describes a typical American family in a typical small town, USA which in this film is called Santa Rosa, CA. Hitch said about the movie, ""I am extremely anxious to avoid the conventional small-town American scene and the stock figures that have been seen in so many films."" Much of the film was shot on location in a real California small town far away from the studio. The director worked closely with the famous writer Thornton Wilder on the screen (Oscar nomination) about a charming attractive young man (Joseph Cotten) who after many years comes to Santa Rosa to visit with the family of his older sister whom he truly loved. He brings into the lives of his relatives, especially his older niece and namesake Charlie (Teresa Wright) excitement and joy. Soon things begin look puzzling and even grim when two undercover detectives from a big city on the East Coast show up in Santa Rosa and reveal to Charlie who by the words of her father, ""has brains"" and the power of observation that her beloved uncle Charlie may be an infamous ""Merry Widows murderer"" on the run.

She excels here as Charley (named for her uncle Charlie), as she grows from excitement over her uncle's visit to gradual suspicion of him. And will not divulge the ending, but it is exciting and a bit unconventional for its time.Joseph Cotten is equally good as Uncle Charlie, who the family loves.

When evil comes to town in the embodiment of the beloved Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton) it is the perceptive niece Young Charlie (Teresa Wright) that slowly uncovers his true identity as the Merry Widow murderer. Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn spend their evenings concocting ways to commit the perfect murder unknowingly under the watchful eyes of the genuine article. Evil takes many shapes and hides behind many facades in broad daylight. Would the wholesome average American community recognize such evil and be willing to deal with it? These are questions that the transplanted Hitchcock would ask about his new home. Another transplant, Dimitri Tiomkin, composed a brilliant score utilizing American idioms laced with the darkness of the tainted soul. This remains one of Hitchcock's best films since it works, as a thriller yet remains a true reflection of a good-natured but generally complacent lifestyle. What is interesting is that Hitchcock shows his usual disdain for police by having the niece foil the Merry Widow murderer and not agent Jack Graham (Macdonald Carey).

66868,AH1M9A3JTV7C3,0783236352,Ian Muldoon,"[1, 3]","Consider two classic Hitchcock motif's - the staircase at night (cf Suspicion, Notorious) and the brattish little girl.  In SHADOW OF A DOUBT there is one five second scene of the former in which Charlie (played by Ms Teresa Wright) niece to a serial killer, her Uncle Charlie,  ascends the staircase at night in the dark with a jug of water and glasses for that Uncle, played by Mr Joseph Cotton.  The bannister bars and the shadows of the staircase fill the scene as she, dressed in a white dress that was a gift from that Uncle, a dress moreover that fits snugly over her hips and thighs and is momentarily transparent as she reaches the top of the stairs, moves towards his door.  It is a moment of erotic tension and dread.  Dramatic irony, filmic composition, film movement, lighting, design, sound all at their most masterful.In the latter case - the &quot;stock&quot; brattish little girl - we have Ann, Charlie's sister and niece to the killer (cf Strangers on a Train) played marvellously throughout by Edna May Wonacott.  Ann wears glasses, (naturally) reads incessantly, has a sharp eye, biting tongue and is nosey little busy body - a miniature intellectual with an IQ of 150 and rising.  When asked by her Uncle Charlie at the close of a meal whether she would like to read the newspaper funnies she responds &quot;  I'm too old for the funnies.  I read two books a week.  I took a sacred oath I would.  Besides, in this family no one in the family is allowed to read at the table.  It isn't polite.&quot;  No patronizing me!!  But it is Ann, the intellectual child whose INTUITION tells her, this Uncle is NOT GOOD.There are many delights in this film shot in stunning and gloriously defined BLACK AND WHITE. A major one is the LOCATION shooting in Santa Rosa.  The scene of the arrival of the train in town is stunning. Another one is the dialogue - Uncle Charlie declaiming at dinner his freelings towards widows as &quot;faded, fat, greedy, wheezy animals&quot; is electrifying.  Less &quot;theatrical&quot; than most of his films, quieter perhaps, more subtle but no less powerful.

Although not one of his famous films, SHADOW OF A DOUBT is pure Hitchcock fun.Beautiful Charlotte ""Charlie"" Newtown lives in the quiet small town of Santa Rosa with loving parents and a brother and sister. Life is routine and safe but dreadfully boring. She was named after her Uncle Charlie Oakley and as his namesake, she feels a special emotional bond to him. They are so much alike or so she thinks.Just as she decides to send him a telegram asking him to visit he sends one saying is on his way to vist. The coincidence strengthens young Charlie's firm belief that her bond with her Uncle is very special.Uncle Charlie arrives with some extra baggage. Two mysterious men have been trailing him and are trying to get information on Uncle Charlie. Charlie's mother is overcome with joy seeing her beloved brother again. The family is complete and there is talk of Uncle Charlie staying in town permanently. Young Charlie is a pretty smart young lady and as she talks to one of the young men trailing Uncle Charlie, she realizes he is one of the suspects who could be the MERRY WIDOW MURDERER. Things begin to add up as she sees dear sweet Uncle Charlie and his mood swings. Soon she realizes she is in danger.Hitchock has taken a loving family and added suspense and drama that may shatter their world. Only young Charlie suspects anything is amiss with Uncle Charlie and it becomes her goal to keep his secret, or what she thinks might be his secret. SHADOW A DOUBT was Hitchocks' first film shot on location and not mainly on a sound stage. A real house was the setting and Santa Rosa, CA, a small town at the time, could double for any small town anywhere in America. Hitchock could tell the story of a typical Middle Class American family that most Americans could relate to. Throw in a mysterious relative who could be guilty of the ultimate crime. We know young Charlie's innocence will be destroyed forever but what will the family know about Uncle Charlie.This is a fun and different Hitchock film. The version I saw had interviews with a delightful Teresa Wright who talks about how wonderful working with Hitchock was and what a great cast there was.

He is building a tight little plot around a small criminal who gets into some serial killing of rich widows in New York or somewhere back East just because he likes money, because he does not like working at all, and because he hates these women who are wasting the money they inherited instead of giving it to someone like him who would make a better use of it since that would prevent him from working ever and forever and might even enable him to open some small business to cover up the bag of green backs. He is on the run. He escapes from the East and moves to California where his sister lives with her family. But the cops are on his tracks and they get quite close. One manages to capture the attention and care of the oldest girl of the family who is over eighteen in order to arrange with her the leaving of the uncle so that he is arrested out of the city. The uncle, the murderer as you have guessed, understands his niece has gotten through the cloud of mystery and has put two and two together and that it does make four in her head. So he has to get rid of her but he fails probably more out of lack of luck than anything else. But the luck of one is the lack of luck of the ether and vice versa. And during that time our uncle is courting the city and becoming some kind of glorious visitor on the music of some Merry Widow.

The fact that this was one of his favourites alone makes it worth a look.  But the film itself is outstanding  and should be seen by more people.  Teresa Wright, one of the best  actresses of the Forties, delivers another terrific performance as the  adoring niece of Joseph Cotten who discovers that her Uncle may have a  secret that would destroy her whole family.  Her developing suspicion is  credibly presented as clues are dropped like only Hitchcock can, and the  viewer is able to completely sympathize with her as she must shoulder the  burden of her knowledge alone.  Cotten quietly makes a menacing villain in  one of his best performances.  The two stars are well supported by Patricia  Collinge as Cotten's loving sister and Wright's mother, and by a very  quirky Hume Cronyn as the next door neighbour whose hobby is  (appropriately) murder.  The screenplay builds the suspense slowly but  steadily, and there are a number of trademark Hitchcock shots.  I may be  biased because Wright, Cotten, and Hitchcock are among my favourites from  the Forties, but I think everyone will agree that Shadow of a Doubt is an  excellent suspense film.",5,Uncle Charley Has A Dark Side,955843200,"04 16, 2000",2000,1268,"['Nowadays', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'much', 'film', 'compared', 'Hitchcock', 'other', 'more', 'famous', 'works', 'fact', 'was', 'one', 'favourites', 'alone', 'look', 'film', 'outstanding', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'people', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'Forties', 'terrific', 'performance', 'adoring', 'niece', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'who', 'Uncle', 'may', 'have', 'secret', 'would', 'destroy', 'whole', 'family', 'developing', 'suspicion', 'credibly', 'presented', 'clues', 'are', 'dropped', 'only', 'Hitchcock', 'can', 'viewer', 'able', 'completely', 'sympathize', 'must', 'shoulder', 'burden', 'knowledge', 'alone', 'Cotten', 'quietly', 'menacing', 'villain', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'two', 'stars', 'are', 'well', 'supported', 'Patricia', 'Collinge', 'Cotten', 'loving', 'sister', 'Wright', 'mother', 'very', 'quirky', 'Hume', 'Cronyn', 'next', 'door', 'neighbour', 'hobby', 'appropriately', 'murder', 'screenplay', 'suspense', 'slowly', 'steadily', 'are', 'number', 'trademark', 'Hitchcock', 'shots', 'may', 'be', 'biased', 'because', 'Wright', 'Cotten', 'Hitchcock', 'are', 'favourites', 'Forties', 'think', 'everyone', 'will', 'agree', 'Shadow', 'Doubt', 'excellent', 'suspense', 'film']",N/A
66872,A106016KSI0YQ,0783236352,Jay Dickson,"[16, 19]","The middle-class Newtons of Santa Rosa, California in Hitchcock's film might seem to be very much akin to the idealized smalltown families in M-G-M films during the Thirties and Forties, if not for the fact that they each seem to have initially retreated into their own fantasy, worlds and seem so out of touch with one another. The father lives to discuss the crime magazines he collects with his next-door neighbor. Anne, the fearfully precocious eight year-old daughter, is trying to read all the novels in the town library. Emma, the sentimental mother, often drops into reveries of her idealized childhood with her adored baby brother Charlie. Charlie's namesake niece (Teresa Wright) is convinced her family needs to be shaken out of their doldrums, and is grateful when her beloved uncle (Joseph Cotton) surprises the family with a welcome surprise visit. But Uncle Charlie is not quite what he seems: the police want to question him about a matter back East, and then there are the expensive gifts he showers his relatives with which don't seem to belong to him...Hitchock once called this variant of the wolf-among-the-lambs parable his best American film; though he later recanted, it's hard not to think his original assessment was right. Although this film has all the cleverness and adroitness we associate with his other great films (in his repeated use of twinning motifs, and in such virtuoso sequences as young Charlie's rush to the library to discover the truth about her uncle--and the famous crane shot when she finds it), it's rare in that it has a truly superb script (credited to Thornton Wilder) that allows Hitchock's excellent cast to play real and multilayered human beings. Although there are many memorable performances in Hitchcock films, he never had another film in which every single member of the cast seems to be living up to his or her highest potential: even the two local Santa Rosa children he cast as the two youngest Newtons, Edna May Wonacott (as the surprisingly complex Anne) and Charles Bates (as little Roger), linger long in the memory. Cotton has the performance of his career as the evil and manipulative Uncle Charlie: he's so effective that initially Teresa Wright, as the younger Charlie (the only one of the Newtons to fully understand the truth about Cotton), seems greatly outmatched. But as the film continues Wright brings such steely determination to her role that you understand how this sweet young woman can successfully be an obstacle to Uncle Charlie's schemes. She's impossible to forget (especially in the way she walks down the street--shoulders hunched, hands clenched--when she runs away from the dinner table).The film's standout performance, however, is the stage actress Patricia Collinge in the great linchpin role of the mother. Collinge's Emma Newton initially seems a fluttering, silly, ordinary woman, but Collinge invests the role with so much depth of feeling that when Uncle Charlie cruelly warns young Charlie what the revelation of his identity will do to his sister, you know why the niece will not dare break her mother's heart (even at the risk of her own life). Collinge's Emma is what the film's deep and abiding humanism (so rare for a Hitchcock film!) is staked upon--she represents both what Uncle Charlie wants to destroy and what young Charlie is so desperate to save. And when Collinge makes her great, sad ""forgetting you're you"" speech near the film's end--where, for in the only time in her life, this sweet, self-martyring woman gives voice to what she may have given up to raise her family--, you fully understand why the stakes are so high. It's a classic performance--perhaps the single finest and richest in Hitchcock's entire corpus.",5,"""They're alive--they're human beings!""",1018656000,"04 13, 2002",2002,3734,"['middle-class', 'Newtons', 'Santa', 'Rosa', 'California', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'might', 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'much', 'akin', 'idealized', 'smalltown', 'families', 'M-G-M', 'films', 'Thirties', 'Forties', 'not', 'fact', 'seem', 'have', 'initially', 'retreated', 'own', 'fantasy', 'worlds', 'seem', 'so', 'touch', 'one', 'father', 'discuss', 'crime', 'magazines', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'Anne', 'fearfully', 'precocious', 'eight', 'year-old', 'daughter', 'trying', 'read', 'novels', 'town', 'library', 'Emma', 'sentimental', 'mother', 'often', 'reveries', 'idealized', 'childhood', 'adored', 'baby', 'brother', 'Charlie', 'Charlie', 'namesake', 'niece', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'convinced', 'family', 'be', 'shaken', 'doldrums', 'grateful', 'when', 'beloved', 'uncle', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', 'family', 'welcome', 'surprise', 'visit', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'not', 'quite', 'what', 'police', 'want', 'question', 'matter', 'back', 'East', 'then', 'are', 'expensive', 'gifts', 'relatives', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'belong', 'Hitchock', 'once', 'called', 'variant', 'wolf-among-the-lambs', 'parable', 'best', 'American', 'film', 'later', 'recanted', 'hard', 'not', 'think', 'original', 'assessment', 'was', 'right', 'film', 'cleverness', 'adroitness', 'associate', 'other', 'great', 'films', 'repeated', 'use', 'twinning', 'motifs', 'such', 'virtuoso', 'sequences', 'young', 'Charlie', 'rush', 'library', 'discover', 'truth', 'uncle', 'famous', 'crane', 'shot', 'when', 'rare', 'truly', 'superb', 'script', 'credited', 'Thornton', 'Wilder', 'Hitchock', 'excellent', 'cast', 'play', 'real', 'multilayered', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'many', 'memorable', 'performances', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'never', 'had', 'film', 'single', 'member', 'cast', 'be', 'living', 'up', 'highest', 'potential', 'even', 'two', 'local', 'Santa', 'Rosa', 'children', 'cast', 'two', 'youngest', 'Newtons', 'Edna', 'May', 'Wonacott', 'surprisingly', 'complex', 'Anne', 'Charles', 'Bates', 'little', 'Roger', 'linger', 'long', 'memory', 'Cotton', 'performance', 'career', 'evil', 'manipulative', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'so', 'effective', 'initially', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'younger', 'Charlie', 'only', 'one', 'Newtons', 'fully', 'understand', 'truth', 'Cotton', 'greatly', 'outmatched', 'film', 'Wright', 'brings', 'such', 'steely', 'determination', 'role', 'understand', 'how', 'sweet', 'young', 'woman', 'can', 'successfully', 'be', 'obstacle', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'schemes', 'impossible', 'forget', 'especially', 'way', 'walks', 'down', 'street', 'shoulders', 'hunched', 'hands', 'clenched', 'when', 'away', 'dinner', 'table', 'film', 'standout', 'performance', 'however', 'stage', 'actress', 'Patricia', 'Collinge', 'great', 'linchpin', 'role', 'mother', 'Collinge', 'Emma', 'Newton', 'initially', 'fluttering', 'silly', 'ordinary', 'woman', 'Collinge', 'role', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'feeling', 'when', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'cruelly', 'young', 'Charlie', 'what', 'revelation', 'identity', 'will', 'do', 'sister', 'know', 'why', 'niece', 'will', 'not', 'dare', 'break', 'mother', 'heart', 'even', 'risk', 'own', 'life', 'Collinge', 'Emma', 'what', 'film', 'deep', 'abiding', 'humanism', 'so', 'rare', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'staked', 'what', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'destroy', 'what', 'young', 'Charlie', 'so', 'desperate', 'save', 'when', 'Collinge', 'great', 'sad', 'forgetting', ""'re"", 'speech', 'film', 'end', 'where', 'only', 'time', 'life', 'sweet', 'self-martyring', 'woman', 'voice', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'raise', 'family', 'fully', 'understand', 'why', 'stakes', 'are', 'so', 'high', 'classic', 'performance', 'perhaps', 'single', 'finest', 'richest', 'Hitchcock', 'entire', 'corpus']",N/A

While that may not,in fact, be true, he did say once that the film offered less to those who were disposed to attack plausibility in his films. At any rate, it is a film that is certainly worthy of more notice than it seems to get. With a superb screenplay by Thornton Wilder, winning performances by all involved, and direction from The Master himself, SHADOW OF A DOUBT is a first-rate suspense thriller.Teresa Wright plays ""Young Charlie,"" a bored young woman of a quiet middle-class town. She was named after her favorite uncle. She dreams of excitement, and she longs for her worldly uncle and namesake to pay her a visit and brighten her world. When Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten) does show up for an extended stay, Young Charlie is instantly uplifted from her season of brooding; she feels a deep connection with her uncle. It is through this almost telepathic connection, however, that Young Charlie begins to put together clues that lead her to suspect her beloved uncle of being the heinous serial killer, dubbed the ""Merry Widow Murderer.""From the opening sequence of the film, we know of course that he is, so the suspense in this film builds around Young Charlie--will she in fact convince herself of the guilt of the uncle she loves so much and might she even share his dark side? Eventually, she chooses to distance herself from her dangerous uncle and increasingly, her well-being is threatened once he knows for certain that she has correctly determined his true identity.Both Cotten and Wright put in strong performances as the two Charlies, while the supporting players are solid in their roles. In particular, a very young-looking Hume Cronyn plays a nerdy murder-buff neighbor and offers some humor in this, his first movie role, and young actress Edna May Wonacott is brilliant and equally funny as the precocious Ann Newton, Young Charlie's little sister.SHADOW OF A DOUBT is a perfectly-crafted little film and is one of Hitchcock's most enjoyable creations. The thrilling end sequence and its tight wrap-up are signature Hitchcock at his finest. Joseph Cotten is one of Hitchcock's strongest villains and, as a result, SHADOW OF A DOUBT is one of his strongest films.Jeremy W.

This black and white classic has suspense, psychological depth, a good script, and good acting.  The story was written by Thornton Wilder.  The script is the strong point of this movie.  It's very simple and easy to understand.  Joseph Cotten plays the role of Charles Oakley very well.  He is the uncle of Charlotte ""Charlie"" Newton, played brilliantly by Teresa Wright.  This uncle-niece relationship seems somewhat creepy at times, as if these two relatives are too close but not quite ""crossing the line"", if you will.  When Charlie discovers her uncle's dark secrets, it sort of saddens and disappoints me because on the one hand it's nice to see an uncle and niece so close, but on the other hand I realize that this relationship needs to go sour due to his dark secrets and their somewhat creepy and close relationship.Teresa Wright dominates this movie with her good looks and outstanding acting.  The ending of the movie is very good.  The musical score by Dimitri Tiomkin is pretty decent.I can see why this was Hitchcock's personal favorite movie he made.  It deserves the praise it has gotten over the years, even though it's still somewhat underrated because it seldom ranks among movies that are considered his VERY best, such as Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958), North By Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960), and The Birds (1963).This DVD comes with good extras, including the documentary Beyond Doubt: The Making Of Hitchcock's Favorite Film, production photographs, production drawings, the theatrical trailer, and more.

This is easily seen even in much-admired films like &quot;North by Northwest&quot;.But &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; (along with &quot;Vertigo&quot; and the first half of &quot;Psycho&quot;) gives the lie to the claim that this was all there was to Hitchcock. This is a film in which every turn of the narrative is governed by the development of character, as a girl matures from giddy teenager to strong (and even deadly) young woman while grappling with the knowledge that her beloved uncle is a serial killer.The acting is uniformly outstanding. Cotten is in full lounge-lizard mode here--nobody ever enunciated a perfectly-balanced sentence with more venom. Hume Cronyn plays a neighborhood geek almost--but not quite--to the point of parody. But it's Teresa Wright who takes the prize here. Wright was a pleasant but unremarkable presence in a number of films, but in &quot;Doubt&quot; she really shows what she was capable of. Consider the expression on her face as she descends the stairs in the climactic scene, and how easy it would have been to overplay it.Perhaps it was the influence of Wilder (though his biographers state that he actually didn't really do much work on the picture), but &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; is one film in which the master outdid himself, stepping beyond the limits of entertainment into something approaching art.",5,I'll Go With the Masses on This One,1085097600,"05 21, 2004",2004,1651,"['question', 'one', 'Hitchcock', 'best', 'ought', 'be', 'lot', 'better', 'truth', 'contention', 'much', 'Hitchcock', 'work', 'based', 'flimsy', 'plotting', 'gimmickry', 'attractive', 'stick', 'figures', 'racing', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'just', 'step', 'ahead', 'sense', 'logic', 'easily', 'seen', 'even', 'much-admired', 'films', 'quot', 'North', 'Northwest', 'quot', '.But', 'quot', 'Shadow', 'Doubt', 'quot', 'quot', 'Vertigo', 'quot', 'first', 'half', 'quot', 'Psycho', 'quot', 'lie', 'claim', 'was', 'there', 'was', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'turn', 'narrative', 'governed', 'development', 'character', 'girl', 'giddy', 'teenager', 'strong', 'even', 'deadly', 'young', 'woman', 'grappling', 'knowledge', 'beloved', 'uncle', 'serial', 'killer.The', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'outstanding', 'Cotten', 'full', 'lounge-lizard', 'mode', 'here', 'nobody', 'ever', 'enunciated', 'perfectly-balanced', 'sentence', 'more', 'venom', 'Hume', 'Cronyn', 'neighborhood', 'geek', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'point', 'parody', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'who', 'prize', 'here', 'Wright', 'was', 'pleasant', 'unremarkable', 'presence', 'number', 'films', 'quot', 'Doubt', 'quot', 'really', 'what', 'was', 'capable', 'Consider', 'expression', 'face', 'stairs', 'climactic', 'scene', 'how', 'easy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'overplay', 'it.Perhaps', 'was', 'influence', 'Wilder', 'biographers', 'state', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'much', 'work', 'picture', 'quot', 'Shadow', 'Doubt', 'quot', 'one', 'film', 'master', 'outdid', 'stepping', 'limits', 'entertainment', 'something', 'approaching', 'art']",N/A

66888,A1LBBULBEREVEF,0783236352,Kathy Fennessy,"[11, 12]","Somewhat reminiscent of Orson Welles' The Stranger (1946), Shadow of a Doubt is a superior film about evil in the most unexpected places and the bottomless human capacity for denial.  This seems somehow fitting since Welles directed Joseph Cotten to such acclaim in The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), also a box office disappointment, and both give such excellent performances in Carole Reed's masterful The Third Man (1949).In Shadow of a Doubt, Cotten plays Charlie Oakley, a widow murderer hiding from the authorities in his sister's pleasant suburban home. (In The Stranger, Welles plays a Nazi hiding from the authorities in another pleasant American suburb.)  Just about everyone--but especially Charlie's adoring namesake niece Charlie (Teresa Wright)--is seduced by his charm and good looks and thinks he's an upstanding citizen.But looks can be deceiving.  The dinner table speech Cotten gives towards the end of the film is the essence of pure evil.  It rivals the speech Welles gives to Cotten on the merry-go-round in The Third Man (and James Mason's &quot;God was wrong&quot; speech in Larger Than Life) as one of the most chilling in cinematic history.  It's more subtle, but just as insidious.  And you'll never hear &quot;The Merry Widow Waltz&quot; the same way again!The script was co-written by Aldred Hitchcock and Thornton Wilder (Our Town, The Skin of Our Teeth).  Although it's long been long assumed that Shadow of a Doubt was Hitchcock's personal favorite, this is not correct.  He disputes the claim in Francois Truffaut's &quot;Hitchcock&quot; (the definitive text for Hitchcock enthusiasts).  He does say, however, that the impression may be &quot;due to my very pleasant memories of working on it with Thornton Wilder...it was so gratifying for me to find out that one of America's most eminent playwrights was willing to work with me, and indeed, that he took the whole thing quite seriously.&quot;Hume Cronyn and Henry Travers (Clarence in It's a Wonderful Life) provide excellent support.  Cronyn would appear in Hitchcock's next film, Lifeboat, also released in 1943.  Shadow of a Doubt was a stellar effort from all involved.  If it failed to find its audience the first time around, time has elevated the film--much like Welles' Touch of Evil (1958)--to the deserved status of classic.",5,Underrated Hitchcock Classic,981849600,"02 11, 2001",2001,2319,"['Somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Stranger', '1946', 'Shadow', 'Doubt', 'superior', 'film', 'evil', 'most', 'unexpected', 'places', 'bottomless', 'human', 'capacity', 'denial', 'somehow', 'fitting', 'Welles', 'directed', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'such', 'acclaim', 'Magnificent', 'Ambersons', '1942', 'also', 'box', 'office', 'disappointment', 'give', 'such', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Carole', 'Reed', 'masterful', 'Third', 'Man', '1949', '.In', 'Shadow', 'Doubt', 'Cotten', 'Charlie', 'Oakley', 'widow', 'murderer', 'hiding', 'authorities', 'sister', 'pleasant', 'suburban', 'home', 'Stranger', 'Welles', 'Nazi', 'hiding', 'authorities', 'pleasant', 'American', 'suburb', 'Just', 'everyone', 'especially', 'Charlie', 'adoring', 'namesake', 'niece', 'Charlie', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'seduced', 'charm', 'good', 'looks', 'upstanding', 'citizen.But', 'can', 'be', 'deceiving', 'dinner', 'table', 'speech', 'Cotten', 'end', 'film', 'essence', 'pure', 'evil', 'speech', 'Welles', 'Cotten', 'merry-go-round', 'Third', 'Man', 'James', 'Mason', 'quot', 'God', 'was', 'wrong', 'quot', 'speech', 'Larger', 'Than', 'Life', 'one', 'most', 'chilling', 'cinematic', 'history', 'more', 'subtle', 'just', 'insidious', ""'ll"", 'never', 'hear', 'quot', 'Merry', 'Widow', 'Waltz', 'quot', 'same', 'way', 'again', 'script', 'was', 'co-written', 'Aldred', 'Hitchcock', 'Thornton', 'Wilder', 'Town', 'Skin', 'Teeth', 'long', 'been', 'long', 'assumed', 'Shadow', 'Doubt', 'was', 'Hitchcock', 'personal', 'favorite', 'not', 'correct', 'claim', 'Francois', 'Truffaut', 'quot', 'Hitchcock', 'quot', 'definitive', 'text', 'Hitchcock', 'enthusiasts', 'say', 'however', 'impression', 'may', 'be', 'quot', 'due', 'very', 'pleasant', 'memories', 'working', 'Thornton', 'Wilder', 'was', 'so', 'gratifying', 'find', 'out', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'eminent', 'playwrights', 'was', 'willing', 'work', 'indeed', 'took', 'whole', 'thing', 'quite', 'seriously.', 'quot', 'Hume', 'Cronyn', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'Clarence', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'provide', 'excellent', 'support', 'Cronyn', 'would', 'appear', 'Hitchcock', 'next', 'film', 'Lifeboat', 'also', 'released', '1943', 'Shadow', 'Doubt', 'was', 'stellar', 'effort', 'involved', 'failed', 'find', 'audience', 'first', 'time', 'time', 'elevated', 'film', 'much', 'Welles', 'Touch', 'Evil', '1958', 'deserved', 'status', 'classic']",N/A

She wasn't necessarily a legend like some of her peers, but her acting embodied a warmth and a skill much like her somewhat later counterpart Patricia Neal, who oddly enough also (like Wright) made her name on the Broadway stage in Lillian Hellman parts.  When Teresa Wright first came to Hollywood, the studio system was alive and kicking and it gave her initially the best roles of her career.  She arrived in Hollywood with the rest of THE LITTLE FOXES company, and stayed around to make little pictures like PRIDE OF THE YANKEES and Mrs. MINIVER.One of her husbands was Niven (""Duel in the Sun"") Busch, who wrote wonderful parts for you in PURSUED and TRACK OF THE CAT, two films which parlayed your ingenue perfection against Robert Mitchum's sexual bravado.  It is said that he wrote DUEL IN THE SUN for Teresa Wright to play, though I can't imagine her writhing across the desert with the elan of Jennifer Jones.  Another husband, Robert Anderson, made memorable use of her screen image in I NEVER SANG FOR MY FATHER.  For some reason she was a writer's actress, and many of Hollywood's top screenwriters vied for her services.  No one did better for Teresa Wright than Thornton Wilder, the Pulitzer Prize winning playwright who wrote SHADOW OF A DOUBT with the teen specialist Sally Benson.  Wilder's memorable portrait of a small town, filled with ordinary people, that becomes the churning pool of a serial killer, was instantly acclaimed upon its release in 1943, and in the years since has come to be seen as one of Alfred Hitchcock's finest and most revealing pictures.  And Teresa Wright gleams at the center of the whirlpool as ""Charlie,"" on the surface an innocent enough teenager in a small Northern California town, but with secret depths that link her filmically to ""Uncle Charlie,"" the part Joseph Cotten played so beautifully.  It's not only that their names are the same, but they seem like two halves of the same person; and the audience senses this without being hit over the head with it due to careful writing and brilliant staging by Hitchcock.  In its own way SHADOW OF A DOUBT is as disturbing and transgressive as any of the contemporary film noir pictures, and will haunt you forever once you see it.Goodbye, Teresa Wright, your powers of shadow and light will live forever.

Oakley is seen lying atop his bed, smoking and pensively staring up at the ceiling, trying to come to some sort of decision. The atmosphere in the room is suffused with unease. The skyline outside the window is Newark, New Jersey.We then cut to Charlotte ""Charlie"" Newton (Wright), who likewise is lying atop her bed and staring thoughtfully up at the ceiling. The atmosphere is suffused with dissatisfaction. The town outside the window is Santa Rosa, California.Young Charlie and Old Charlie are niece and uncle, and share an almost psychic bond. Young Charlie is chafing at the ordinariness of life in her small town. Old Charlie is chafing at a troubling and unusual situation in his life. Young Charlie decides to spice things up by inviting her uncle, a world traveler, to Santa Rosa, and sends him a telegram. Old Charlie decides to take up a more bland and mundane lifestyle and sends his niece a telegram telling her he will be arriving in Santa Rosa very shortly. Thus do innocence and worldliness collide.When Old Charlie arrives, the family, especially Young Charlie, is ecstatic, but as the story slowly, deliberately, unfolds, it becomes clear that Old Charlie is hiding a dark secret. The mystery deepens when MacDonald Carey comes to town, showing an exaggerated interest in the Newton family. As it turns out, Charles Oakley certainly is hiding something, a something his adoring niece quickly discovers. Although she swears to keep his secret, Old Charlie prefers not to take any chances, and his niece and namesake soon begins to suffer a series of potentially deadly accidents. One of these accidents finally has results.Cotten and Wright play off each other well as the close-bonded Charlies. Cotten is utterly contemptuous of Wright's innocence. She at first wishes she could shed her small-town ingenuousness, but then begins to realize how central it is to her conception of the good life. Cotten was known for his ""bad guys,"" while the Academy Award-winning Wright is remembered as a serious actress devoted to playing only meaningful female roles in the sexist 1940s (her studio contract had a rider refusing 'cheesecake').The Twenty-Something Wright is at the peak of her powers and reaches her highest standards in SHADOW OF A DOUBT.Hitch himself appears as a card-playing passenger on a train, and the film is also notable as Hume Cronyn's film debut as a lighthearted neighbor who enjoys trading ideas on how to commit murder with Young Charlie's otherwise button-down Dad.The pacing is a bit slow for a 200___ audience, but this moderately noir film is certainly worth enjoying.",4,Hitchcock's Personal Favorite,1190592000,"09 24, 2007",2007,2915,"['1943', 'SHADOW', 'A', 'DOUBT', 'written', 'Thornton', 'Wilder', 'starring', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'was', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'favorite', 'own', 'films', 'widely', 'considered', 'best', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'finest', 'performance.As', 'film', 'meet', 'debonair', 'Charles', 'Oakley', 'Cotten', 'Oakley', 'seen', 'lying', 'atop', 'bed', 'smoking', 'pensively', 'staring', 'up', 'ceiling', 'trying', 'come', 'sort', 'decision', 'atmosphere', 'room', 'suffused', 'unease', 'skyline', 'window', 'Newark', 'New', 'Jersey.We', 'then', 'cut', 'Charlotte', 'Charlie', 'Newton', 'Wright', 'who', 'likewise', 'lying', 'bed', 'staring', 'thoughtfully', 'up', 'ceiling', 'atmosphere', 'suffused', 'dissatisfaction', 'town', 'window', 'Santa', 'Rosa', 'California.Young', 'Charlie', 'Old', 'Charlie', 'are', 'niece', 'uncle', 'share', 'almost', 'psychic', 'bond', 'Young', 'Charlie', 'chafing', 'ordinariness', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'Old', 'Charlie', 'chafing', 'troubling', 'unusual', 'situation', 'life', 'Young', 'Charlie', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'inviting', 'uncle', 'world', 'traveler', 'Santa', 'Rosa', 'telegram', 'Old', 'Charlie', 'take', 'up', 'more', 'bland', 'mundane', 'lifestyle', 'niece', 'telegram', 'telling', 'will', 'be', 'arriving', 'Santa', 'Rosa', 'very', 'shortly', 'Thus', 'do', 'innocence', 'worldliness', 'collide.When', 'Old', 'Charlie', 'family', 'especially', 'Young', 'Charlie', 'ecstatic', 'story', 'slowly', 'deliberately', 'unfolds', 'clear', 'Old', 'Charlie', 'hiding', 'dark', 'secret', 'mystery', 'when', 'MacDonald', 'Carey', 'town', 'showing', 'exaggerated', 'interest', 'Newton', 'family', 'out', 'Charles', 'Oakley', 'certainly', 'hiding', 'something', 'something', 'adoring', 'niece', 'quickly', 'discovers', 'keep', 'secret', 'Old', 'Charlie', 'not', 'take', 'chances', 'niece', 'namesake', 'soon', 'suffer', 'series', 'potentially', 'deadly', 'accidents', 'One', 'accidents', 'finally', 'results.Cotten', 'Wright', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'well', 'close-bonded', 'Charlies', 'Cotten', 'utterly', 'contemptuous', 'Wright', 'innocence', 'first', 'wishes', 'could', 'shed', 'small-town', 'ingenuousness', 'then', 'realize', 'how', 'central', 'conception', 'good', 'life', 'Cotten', 'was', 'known', 'bad', 'guys', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'Wright', 'remembered', 'serious', 'actress', 'devoted', 'playing', 'only', 'meaningful', 'female', 'roles', 'sexist', '1940s', 'studio', 'contract', 'had', 'rider', 'refusing', ""'cheesecake"", '.The', 'Twenty-Something', 'Wright', 'peak', 'powers', 'highest', 'standards', 'SHADOW', 'A', 'DOUBT.Hitch', 'card-playing', 'passenger', 'train', 'film', 'also', 'notable', 'Hume', 'Cronyn', 'film', 'debut', 'lighthearted', 'neighbor', 'who', 'trading', 'ideas', 'how', 'commit', 'murder', 'Young', 'Charlie', 'otherwise', 'button-down', 'Dad.The', 'pacing', 'bit', 'slow', '200___', 'audience', 'moderately', 'noir', 'film', 'certainly', 'worth', 'enjoying']",N/A

66898,AD2BIAIH78QI5,0783236352,"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal""","[1, 3]","Hitchcock's films often feature good people who somehow get themselves involved in something not quite kosher which escalates to something they feel they can't report to the police, or else it will be bad for them. ""Strangers on a Train"" is like that; so is ""Rear Window"". Here in ""Shadow of a Doubt"", the same plot device rears its head again, but with a difference. Usually the ""bad thing"" is rooted in some kind of external event, but in this movie, the young niece uncovers a monstrous secret about her favorite uncle, who is visiting in the family home.This is about the only movie in which I like Teresa Wright (Young Charlie), whom I usually find grating. But here, she does a creditable job as an ordinary girl who must grow up awful quick if she is to defend herself against this wolf in sheep's clothing, Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten). I'm amazed by how convincing Joseph Cotten is as Uncle Charlie, the shady murderer whom these naive people take to be a sophisticate. Hard to believe that he didn't go on to make a career of creeps in the movies, but he went right back to his ""good guy"" roles. For instance, he was capable of a lot more than the artist in the later ""Portrait of Jennie"", a good movie to be sure, but not a challenging role by any means.  The actress playing the mother is very good; I've known many women as ""on the edge"" emotionally as she is, with an almost morbid sentimentality. The only oddity in the whole cast is MacDonald Carey as the detective-love interest. Mother calls him a nice young man, but he didn't strike me as all that young, and golly, he certainly is no dream boat. Is he supposed to be the ""everyman"" that most women will wind up marrying, a safe choice after the thrill of knowing an ""Uncle Charlie"" wears off?And that brings me to my next observation, that there is something unsavory about the relationship between Uncle Charlie and Young Charlie. Even before Young Charlie finds out his secret, Uncle Charlie seems inordinately interested in the young girl. In today's climate, it doesn't take much imagination to wonder whether there's an incest subtext going on here. First the girl is very fond of her uncle, then can't bear his touching her, while he enjoins her to keep their secret because it would kill her mother to learn the truth. Also, the age difference between Wright and Cotten is not all that much, Hollywood-wise. It is highly conceivable they could've played love interests in a different movie, as she is also about the same amount of years younger than Gary Cooper in ""Pride of the Yankees"".So, ""Shadow of a Doubt"" is a somewhat disturbing movie because of its focus in the home and among the family. It is nonetheless very well executed. My only complaint is that it is a little too long; hence the 4 stars rather than 5.",4,Terror Comes Home,1024617600,"06 21, 2002",2002,2798,"['Hitchcock', 'films', 'often', 'feature', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'somehow', 'get', 'involved', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'kosher', 'something', 'feel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'report', 'police', 'else', 'will', 'be', 'bad', 'Strangers', 'Train', 'so', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Here', 'Shadow', 'Doubt', 'same', 'plot', 'device', 'head', 'again', 'difference', 'Usually', 'bad', 'thing', 'rooted', 'kind', 'external', 'event', 'movie', 'young', 'niece', 'uncovers', 'monstrous', 'secret', 'favorite', 'uncle', 'who', 'visiting', 'family', 'home.This', 'only', 'movie', 'like', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'Young', 'Charlie', 'whom', 'usually', 'find', 'grating', 'here', 'creditable', 'job', 'ordinary', 'girl', 'who', 'must', 'grow', 'up', 'awful', 'quick', 'defend', 'wolf', 'sheep', 'clothing', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'how', 'convincing', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'shady', 'murderer', 'whom', 'naive', 'people', 'take', 'be', 'sophisticate', 'Hard', 'believe', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'make', 'career', 'creeps', 'movies', 'went', 'right', 'back', 'good', 'guy', 'roles', 'instance', 'was', 'capable', 'lot', 'more', 'artist', 'later', 'Portrait', 'Jennie', 'good', 'movie', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'challenging', 'role', 'means', 'actress', 'playing', 'mother', 'very', 'good', ""'ve"", 'known', 'many', 'women', 'edge', 'emotionally', 'almost', 'morbid', 'sentimentality', 'only', 'oddity', 'whole', 'cast', 'MacDonald', 'Carey', 'detective-love', 'interest', 'Mother', 'nice', 'young', 'man', 'did', ""n't"", 'strike', 'young', 'golly', 'certainly', 'dream', 'boat', 'supposed', 'be', 'everyman', 'most', 'women', 'will', 'wind', 'up', 'marrying', 'safe', 'choice', 'thrill', 'knowing', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'next', 'observation', 'something', 'unsavory', 'relationship', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'Young', 'Charlie', 'Even', 'Young', 'Charlie', 'out', 'secret', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'inordinately', 'interested', 'young', 'girl', 'today', 'climate', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'imagination', 'wonder', 'incest', 'subtext', 'going', 'here', 'First', 'girl', 'very', 'fond', 'uncle', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'touching', 'keep', 'secret', 'would', 'kill', 'mother', 'learn', 'truth', 'Also', 'age', 'difference', 'Wright', 'Cotten', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'Hollywood-wise', 'highly', 'conceivable', 'could', ""'ve"", 'played', 'love', 'interests', 'different', 'movie', 'also', 'same', 'amount', 'years', 'younger', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Pride', 'Yankees', '.So', 'Shadow', 'Doubt', 'somewhat', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'focus', 'home', 'family', 'nonetheless', 'very', 'well', 'executed', 'only', 'complaint', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'hence', '4', 'stars', 'rather', '5']",N/A

66905,A2KU7P78NO3IKN,0783236352,"M. Elaine Wood ""odd movie buff""","[1, 1]","...Shadow of a Doubt is without a doubt one of the most slyly subversive of all Hitchcock's films. Taking off from the trope of the idyllic American small town, Shadow hints at all manner of perversions. Not simply those of mania and mass homicide, but of the subtler and more insidious forms of evil: the subversion of innocence, the taint of incest, the seductive qualities of madness and malice, the suggestion that behind the closed doors of 'normal' homes are forms of horror that might actually make Uncle Charlie's doings pale by comparison.I don't find it surprising that Hitch selected the debonair and genial Joseph Cotten to play Charles...much like James Stewart later on, Cotten must have suggested to Hitchcock the perfect combination of to-all-appearances All-American charm and normality; but lurking just below that pleasing surface is an ability to evoke a disturbed and disturbing psyche whose immanent expression sometimes lies just a little too close to the top for comfort.Psychotic Uncle Charlie adores his niece just as much as she adores him, but in a way that is clearly colored by both a warped desire to strip her of her innocent illusions about life and an equally perverse desire that's tinged with a sort of eroticism that supposedly has no place in familial relations. Charles' famous speech to Young Charlie, where he refers to the idea that if one could rip the fronts from average homes, one would find swine, is oddly suggestive. Where did Charles originally come by this view? Was there, perhaps, something within the makeup of his own early years that led him to realize the supposedly pristine outer demeanor of 'nice' families might harbor goings-on that were anything but sweetness and light? What sort of relationship is being hinted at between Charles and his sister, which, in some ways, seems redolent of something a bit other than simply loving siblings? And is Charles, sickened as he obviously is by his murderous contacts with bovine and unappetizing older females, in turn transferring both his hopelessly corrupted worldview and a need to fasten onto a lovely and uncorrupted young woman to the most terrifying object possible--the trusting and adoring Charlie, who feels a special bond with him? A bond that might incorporate hints of a dark side within young Charlie herself, if I'm reading what seem to be Hitchcock's subtexts correctly.The reverberations of the relationship between the two Charlies is fascinating, and goes deep--there is a lot there for the viewer who goes looking between the lines, and more than enough to satisfy the viewer who simply sees their relations as the workings out of an utterly enjoyable cat-and-mouse suspenser.  There are levels and levels within the framework of a seemingly simple story going on, and the shadings of Wright's and Cotten's wonderfully delicate, while at the same time eyebrow-raisingly suggestive, performances bring out every nuance of Thornton Wilder's script in a way that must have been rather unsettling to the supposedly more naive audiences of its time.The America of Alfred Hitchcock harbored for him the possibility of a sort of sunlit horror made all the more frightening by the lovingly applied veneer of peace and normality the film ultimately celebrates. And nowhere within his American output did Hitchcock ever work out this dichotomy so well and to such unnerving effect as he did in this film. Small wonder it was named by him as his favorite--many of the the more baroque preoccupations Hitchcock harbored regarding Eros and Thanatos were never again to be as subtly, and as oddly beautifully realized as they were here.",5,Surprisingly twisted for its era...,1397779200,"04 18, 2014",2014,3647,"['Shadow', 'Doubt', 'doubt', 'one', 'most', 'slyly', 'subversive', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'Taking', 'off', 'trope', 'idyllic', 'American', 'small', 'town', 'Shadow', 'hints', 'manner', 'perversions', 'Not', 'simply', 'mania', 'mass', 'homicide', 'subtler', 'more', 'insidious', 'forms', 'evil', 'subversion', 'innocence', 'taint', 'incest', 'seductive', 'qualities', 'madness', 'malice', 'suggestion', 'closed', 'doors', ""'normal"", 'homes', 'are', 'forms', 'horror', 'might', 'actually', 'make', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'doings', 'pale', 'comparison.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'surprising', 'Hitch', 'selected', 'debonair', 'genial', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'play', 'Charles', 'much', 'James', 'Stewart', 'later', 'Cotten', 'must', 'have', 'suggested', 'Hitchcock', 'perfect', 'combination', 'to-all-appearances', 'All-American', 'charm', 'normality', 'lurking', 'just', 'pleasing', 'surface', 'ability', 'evoke', 'disturbed', 'disturbing', 'psyche', 'immanent', 'expression', 'sometimes', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'close', 'top', 'comfort.Psychotic', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'niece', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'way', 'clearly', 'colored', 'warped', 'desire', 'strip', 'her', 'innocent', 'illusions', 'life', 'equally', 'perverse', 'desire', 'tinged', 'sort', 'eroticism', 'supposedly', 'place', 'familial', 'relations', 'Charles', 'famous', 'speech', 'Young', 'Charlie', 'where', 'idea', 'one', 'could', 'rip', 'fronts', 'average', 'homes', 'one', 'would', 'find', 'swine', 'oddly', 'suggestive', 'Where', 'did', 'Charles', 'originally', 'come', 'view', 'Was', 'there', 'perhaps', 'something', 'makeup', 'own', 'early', 'years', 'led', 'realize', 'supposedly', 'pristine', 'outer', 'demeanor', ""'nice"", 'families', 'might', 'harbor', 'goings-on', 'were', 'anything', 'sweetness', 'light', 'What', 'sort', 'relationship', 'being', 'hinted', 'Charles', 'sister', 'ways', 'redolent', 'something', 'bit', 'other', 'simply', 'loving', 'siblings', 'Charles', 'sickened', 'obviously', 'murderous', 'contacts', 'bovine', 'unappetizing', 'older', 'females', 'turn', 'transferring', 'hopelessly', 'corrupted', 'worldview', 'need', 'fasten', 'lovely', 'uncorrupted', 'young', 'woman', 'most', 'terrifying', 'object', 'possible', 'trusting', 'adoring', 'Charlie', 'who', 'special', 'bond', 'bond', 'might', 'incorporate', 'hints', 'dark', 'side', 'young', 'Charlie', ""'m"", 'reading', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'Hitchcock', 'subtexts', 'correctly.The', 'reverberations', 'relationship', 'two', 'Charlies', 'fascinating', 'deep', 'lot', 'there', 'viewer', 'who', 'looking', 'lines', 'more', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'viewer', 'who', 'simply', 'relations', 'workings', 'utterly', 'enjoyable', 'cat-and-mouse', 'suspenser', 'are', 'levels', 'levels', 'framework', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'story', 'going', 'shadings', 'Wright', 'Cotten', 'wonderfully', 'delicate', 'same', 'time', 'eyebrow-raisingly', 'suggestive', 'performances', 'bring', 'out', 'nuance', 'Thornton', 'Wilder', 'script', 'way', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'unsettling', 'supposedly', 'more', 'naive', 'audiences', 'time.The', 'America', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'harbored', 'possibility', 'sort', 'sunlit', 'horror', 'made', 'more', 'frightening', 'lovingly', 'applied', 'veneer', 'peace', 'normality', 'film', 'ultimately', 'nowhere', 'American', 'output', 'did', 'Hitchcock', 'ever', 'work', 'out', 'dichotomy', 'so', 'well', 'such', 'unnerving', 'effect', 'did', 'film', 'Small', 'wonder', 'was', 'named', 'favorite', 'many', 'more', 'baroque', 'preoccupations', 'Hitchcock', 'harbored', 'regarding', 'Eros', 'Thanatos', 'were', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'as', 'subtly', 'oddly', 'beautifully', 'realized', 'were', 'here']",N/A
66906,A9BC9ZVINYMHQ,0783236352,"Meredith Burton ""Bookworm""","[3, 4]","I first became acquainted with this movie through seeing it on Turner Classic Movies not to long ago. As I have come to find out, it is one of Alfred Hitchcock's favorites which he directed. It is verry easy to see why! This movie deals with the initial innocence and growing maturity of a young girl who comes to realize that her beloved uncle is not what he seems to be. The movie symbolically relates this girl's awakening while examining the deep psychological bond between herself and a charming yet repellent evil.Charlott, (Chharlie,) played by the exceptional Teresa Wright, is a young teenager who is brooding over the fact that nothing of interest and sustenance occurs within the small town in which she lives. She decides to send a telegram to her dearly beloved Uncle Charlie, ( wonderfully portrayed by Joseph Cotten,) who, unknowingly to her, has already sent a telegram saying that he will come and visit her and her family. Charlie learns this, and the audience becomes aware of a deeply loving and almost telepathic bond between Charlotte and her uncle. After Uncle Charlie's arrival, Charlotte becomes aware of suspicious behaviors on her uncle's part, besides his inherent charm. The movie climactically builds as Charlie discovers her uncle's true nature as a coldblooded serial killer with a cynical view of the workings of the world, but who has a likable nature that can tempt others. Charlie must struggle with the dilemma of deciding what to do with these revelations as she wrestles with conflicting feelings of love and repulsion about her uncle. This movie explores with frank clarity the shattering of innocence through experience, and the realization that evil can exist within anyone whom we feel closest too.""Shadow of a Doubt"" is filled with many unforgettable supporting characters who are represented as innocent and idyllic individuals in a small town. The use of gentle humor on the parts of these other characters makes the plot move along and also provides commic relief. The script for this movie, written by Thorton Wilder, provides a good balance of the lighthearted and sinister. I can hardly believe that Thorton Wilder, who wrote ""Our Town,"" could write something so vastly different, but his play shows the sinister side of life in a small community.This movie is truly superb, and one which I thoroughly recommend to anyone who loves stories about childhood development through experience, and true psychological examinations of the human heart.

Shadow of a Doubt shows how we can have monsters living among us -- monsters who may be the people we love and care for the most. The great Joseph Cotten -- one of the most underrated actors of all time -- plays Uncle Charlie with great, seething menace and yet shows such charm and likability on the surface that we can see why his family loves him. It was rare to see such a portrait of such unrepentant evil on film during that time. But in ""Shadow,"" Hitchcock unhesitatingly shows that even in the most genial, friendly atmosphere, pure evil can survive and even flourish. Cotten's Uncle Charlie is a serial killer, but is able to win the entire town of Santa Rosa over with his charm and shows just how frighteningly easy it is for the devil to live among us. The story resonates even more now since the world has been exposed to people like Ed Gein, Charles Whitman, John Wayne Gacy, David Berkowitz and Jeffrey Dahmer -- people whose seeming normality masked unimaginable evil.

66908,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,0783236352,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[6, 8]","Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt, a film celebrated as one of his best motion picture projects made in America, had its origins in the killing spree of the true `Merry Widow' murderer Earle Leonard Nelson. Nelson murdered twenty people, including an eight-month old child, in just a year and a half before he was captured in Canada and hanged for his crimes.Having made himself a household name with his career defining performance in Orson Welles's celebrated motion picture drama Citizen Kane, Joseph Cotton was just the marquee lead actor Alfred Hitchcock needed to fill the role of Uncle Charlie, a man who hides a dark secret. He is a cunning and manipulative individual, whose near-fatal bicycle accident as a child left with a permanent mental scar, viewing the world with hostility and fear. One can even go so far as to suggest that Uncle Charlie is the American equivalent of Satan, Prince of Darkness. After attending Church, the young Charlie is confronted outside by her uncle, ""How was church, Charlie? Count the house? Turn anybody away?"" ""No,"" she exclaims, ""room enough for everyone"". ""I'm glad hear that,"" he retorts, ""Show's been running such a long time, I thought maybe attendance might be falling off"". Regardless of the `twin-ship' they share together, the opposing sides of the two Charlies can be seen clearly in this regard.The balance between good and evil is a prime subject of Shadow of a Doubt, exemplified through the director's perpetual use of pairs - the two Charlies, the two detectives, the two 'questionnaire' men, the two church scenes, the two garage scenes, the two train sequences (as Uncle Charlie arrives in Santa Rosa and then departs), the two attempts on young Charlie's life, the two murder suspects, and, most cleverly of all, the 'Til Two Bar.Hume Cronyn made his motion picture debut as the collective mother's boy Herbie Hawkins in Shadow of a Doubt. Additionally the film sparked a lasting friendship and partnership with director Alfred Hitchcock who brought him aboard future projects including Lifeboat, Suspense (a 1950s television program Hitchcock was requested to help put together), and Alfred Hitchcock Presents as well as requesting his assistance in contributing to the scripts of Rope and Under Capricorn. Henry Travers is best remembered today as Jimmy Stewart's guardian angel Clarence in Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life. Neither one contributes much in the way of advancing the storyline but they do provide some dark yet still light-hearted humor to the script. Bored with the melancholy of small town American life, they banter about how one might be able to commit the perfect murder, each coming up with more diabolical ways to one-up the other. Herbie is preoccupied with setting a detective novel (leaving clues and the like so as to write a book about his exploits) while Joseph is more obsessed with getting away with murder then producing a book about it. This of course is all the more perfectly ironic given that there is an actual murderer in their midst and they are too absorbed with their `game' that they are too `blind' to see Uncle Charlie for who he really is - the Merry Widow Murderer.Although it is a shame, a near travesty really, that Shadow of a Doubt should be nominated for an Academy Award in one solitary category, it was at least selected for the category it deserved the most recognition in, Best Original Screenplay. By the time principle photography began on Shadow of a Doubt in 1942 nearly six or seven individual writers had contributed to its screenplay (only four were credited onscreen). Among them were Alma Reville (Hitchcock's wife), Sally Benson (whose later contributions would include Meet Me in St. Louis and Anna and the King of Siam), Gordon McDonell (who came originally came up with the story), and, most famously, Thorton Wilder, playwright of Our Town. Wilder's contributions to the script were arguably the most significant, solidifying the basic superstructure of the storyline which exposed the almost seedy underbelly of this small New England town, a dark side to Grover's Corners if you will.Surprisingly Alfred Hithcock's Shadow of a Doubt delves into a few unconventional issues. Among them, one often overlooked by modern audiences (a perplexity given that it would have been more noticeable to audiences today then it was back when it was first released), is the incestuous relationship between Uncle Charlie and his young teenage niece who is named after him. Sadly the overwhelming presence of the Hays Office during this time eliminated any prospect other then merely suggesting such a sexually fueled kinship but it is enough to make anyone a bit unnerved, more so when Uncle Charlie's dark `secret' is finally exposed. The scene in which Uncle Charlie gives young Charlie a gift, an emerald ring, despite his niece's objections to being given anything other then his presence at their home, in the privacy of the kitchen is the most evident example of this. This of course means to suggest that two have been betrothed (a suggestion reaffirmed by young Charlie's kid sister who in response to hearing young Charlie hum the `Merry Widow Waltz' to herself, ""Sing at the table and you'll marry a crazy husband""), something which makes the scene in which Uncle Charlie attempts to kill his young niece (the broken stairs, the running car in the garage, and attempting to throw her off a fast-moving train) all the more poignant. In addition, Shadow of a Doubt confronts issues of superstition, among them mental telepathy (young Charlie knowing exactly when Uncle Charlie was coming to visit them in Santa Rosa, California) and bad luck (Joseph's warning to Uncle Charlie not to toss his hat on young Charlie's bed and the green emerald - a sign of bad luck - Uncle Charlie gives to his niece).Shadow of a Doubt is one of the select few Hitchcock productions in the time leading up to and after the United States' entry into World War II that he chose not comment, allusively or directly, to the political goings on of the world, although one scene can suggestively be interpreted as making a pointed commentary. Specifically in one scene Uncle Charlie teases Joseph, the young Charlie's father, about working in the bank saying, ""Can you stop embezzling a minute and give me your attention? What's a little shortage in the books at the end of the month? Any good bank clerk can cover up a little shortage, isn't that right, Charlie? We all know what banks are. They look all right to an outsider, but no one knows what goes on when the doors are lock"". This is exactly the sort of material that would have been ripe for censorship during the Hollywood Blacklisting. While director Alfred Hitchcock was concentrated during the 1940s on picking out the evils of Nazism and fascism in Europe, it would be much later in the 1950s when he tackled the political implications of Communism. This could very well be the first instance of this.Shadow of a Doubt not only stands as one of Alfred Hitchcock's definitive best, but in general in represents solid filmmaking, plain and simple. Carefully orchestrated, leaving no detail untouched, it has intrigue, mystery, dark humor, brilliant performances, and a good ol' slice of hometown Americana which makes it simply irresistible.",4,The

Shadow of a Doubt gave him the opportunity of his career:  to join with Thornton Wilder, author of Our Town and the great celebrant of  the poetry in everyday life, to create a story about the horror in everyday  life. Joseph Cotten plays Uncle Charlie--an elegant, genial, seemingly  upstanding citizen, adored by his family in sleepy Santa Rosa, Calif.--who  is actually a deranged serial killer. Teresa Wright is his niece and  namesake, who slowly awakens to the truth about her uncle and finds herself  in peril. The film is impeccably paced and the dialogue brilliant, but much  of the impact of the film must be credited to Cotten, who had a natural  ability to play sinister roles and never again had such a great opportunity  to do so. His great speech to his niece gives us goosebumps just to think  about: &quot;Do you know that the world is a foul sty? And if you ripped  the facades off houses, you'd find swine?&quot; (Considering that this film  was made in the middle of World War II, that line must have had  sledgehammer impact on the film's first audiences.) Teresa Wright and all  the other performers are excellent, but special mention must be made of  Patricia Collinge, who as the mother of the family plays a character as  close to the pure spirit of love as has ever been portrayed on the screen.  She is deeply moving, all the more so because of her contrast to Uncle  Charlie, the baby brother she adores.

I was utterly riveted by her introspective performance and natural beauty.The story is that a serial killer, Cotton, decides to hide at his sister's house, far away from his hunting ground in the northeast. It is clear that he is the killer from the very beginning, so there is no suspense about that. Once in CA, he meets his sister and his niece, Charlie, both of whom adore him.  However, it becomes clear that neither of them recognizes him for what he is:  a sociopath and con man on his last desperate run.The emotional center is Teresa Wright, who cannot ignore her suspicions at his strange yet simple behavior.  Not only does she observe him, but he makes cryptic and frightening utterances to her that seem to reveal what he really is underneath.The most amazing thing is that nothing much really happens.  And yet a sense of menace and terror grows until it is undeniable.  This makes it the best kind of psychological thriller:  most of the development is internal, as revealed by the body language of Wright, in her perfect acting.  Cotton too is great, a creepy presence who emerges from the shadows now and then, whose actions occur almost entirely offstage.  Of course, young Charlie's parents and siblings form the perfect backdrop, normal people unaware of the drama going on inside of her, yet curiously reflecting the mind of the older Charlie, who is charming the entire town.  Wright wants to protect all of them from the truth as it dawns on her, a grief that will mark her and her alone for the rest of her life.Highest recommendation.

Cotton as the sinister 'Uncle Charlie' is especially creepy and realistic.  His niece, Charlie the Younger if you will, is also excellent as the girl who almost falls in love with her long lost Uncle only to grow increasingly suspicious of this handsome but truly odd man.Cotton, as it turns out, is a serial killer, having killed at least three wealthy widows for their money.  But, to my way of thinking, the most fascinating part of his portrayal is not that he is an oily con man but, in many ways, he's exactly the opposite.  He's idiosyncratic to the extreme with an extraordinarily crabbed view of life in general and especially, from his point of view, parasitic heiresses who deserve no more than extermination.His niece becomes increasingly alarmed at her Uncle's philosophy although she doesn't want to believe the worst.

Johnson,"[5, 7]","This is simply fabulous; a completely unique story, set in a quiet, gentle small town, innocent in all its doings, until Uncle Charlie comes to call. Really the finest of Joseph Cotten's performances, this role is perfect, and he is truly frightening in his contrast of personalities, one for his sister and family, the surface one, and his hidden personality, that of the malevolent murderer. He despises rich women, particularly rich widows, and goes after them with a vengenace. Attractive and charismatic, he has no problem attracting them, to their eventual doom. He makes a slip and gives Charlie, his niece, a ring he stole from one of his victims, with the initials engraved on the inside of the band, and Charlie, her admiration and love for her uncle rapidly dwindling, does some late night research at the local library and discovers the identity of the intials on her ring. Theresa Wright is brilliant and believable, as are her entire family, her mother, whom I greatly admire, and father, perfect in his small town role, and her little brother and sister, the bookworm sister my favorite of all. Hume Cronyn, a friend and neighbor of the father's, engages in an ongoing game of how to create the perfect murder...always arriving during dinnertime and when asked how his mother is (he lives with her) he says ""Middling, just middling."" As the movie progresses and Charlie becomes more and more convinced that her uncle is the serial killer being sought by the two detectives who followed him to Santa Rosa, the tension increases and Charlie's life is threatened as well. My favorite scene is at the dinner table when Uncle Charlie tips his mitt a bit by expounding on rich widows: ""Fat, greedy women, eating the money, drinking the money, proud of their jewelry but nothing else...and what do we do with animals when they grow too old and too fat?""And the scene in the bar, foreign land for Charlie, and a great scene, with Joseph Cotten twisting a napkin in his hands, and Charlie watching him do it, and thinking about all the women done away with by these same hands...there is a bit part of a barmaid, a school acquaintance of Charlie's with a jaded, resigned air of her lot in life as that of a waitress with no hope for the future. Uncle Charlie tells his niece that she knows nothing of him or life in general, and she ""lives her perfect, ordinary life in her ordinary little town, dreaming stupid, silly dreams...and ""I brought you nightmares..."" Indeed.Hitchcock filmed this in the town of Santa Rosa, in a real house, and the attention to the small town aura is evident throughout; also the decade of the 1940s, lends an air of real innocence, a world complacent and happy and unaware of the Uncle Charlies of the outside world.

Her mother is a gossip and meticulous about the house and kitchen.  Her father and is brother in law love to make up murderous plots about to kill each other, all in fun and ""to relax.""  ""See this mushroom?  Add a toadstool or two and you'd be dead!""She gets the idea to contact her uncle Charlie by telegram to come out to Santa Rosa, California.  At the same time, Uncle Charlie (her mother's brother) decides to get out of the East as he is being followed by two detectives.As with the audience, we are just as puzzled as Charlie.  Is Uncle Charlie actually a serial killer?  As we follow his adventures we come to believe he just may be!Particularly chilling is his speech at the dinner table about rich widows who take all the money their husbands had worked all their lives to accumulate, and just like the fat animals they are, should be taken out and slaughtered.  Whoa!Charlie is convinced and her uncle creates various ""accidents"" to put her out of the way permanently as he realizes she knows he may be the Merry Widow murderer.Based on an actual killer of the times, Hitchcock expertly weaves a tale of suspicion and leads his audience to the final conclusion with purpose and darkness.Some trivia:It's fun seeing Santa Rosa here, as I don't live much further than 100 miles from the place, currently a major town in Northern California.  Hitchcock found just the right house for his film, but he loved the run-down look.  The occupants cleaned the place up and gave it a new paint job to Hitchcock's chagrin (which he then had his men return it to its rundown condition!).Shadow of a Doubt was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing, Original Story, Gordon McDonell.And Joseph Cotten is amazing as the evil uncle Charlie, who you can see that he sincerely loves his family, he has no intention of getting caught and will go to any means to prevent that.  He can't help but say things that lead one to suspicion.When Charlie starts avoiding him as she finds out more and more about her uncle, the tension builds and the accusations fly.It is also said to be one of Alfred Hitchcock's most favorite films.  You got to see this!The DVD collection I borrowed from also has some cool behind the scenes from the original actors, including Teresa Wright (Charlie), who unfortunately died soon after this, in 2005.Shadow of a Doubt was remade in 1958 as Step Down to Terror and again as a TV movie in 1991 also called Shadow of a Doubt, both of which I have not see.

In the sleepy setting of 1943 Santa Rosa, California, Charley Oakley pays a visit to his sister Emmy and her family.  While in Santa Rosa, Charley at first seems to be a personable and successful individual, but he seems unreasonably upset when he thinks people are trying to find out about him...........The film portrays throughout the theme of affinity between Uncle Charley and his namesake neice played by Teresa Wright. Great is the scene where the neice races to the public library in order to find a missing clue in the newspaper.  Joseph Cotton and Teresa Wright contribute excellent performances which give vitality to the conception of their like yet opposite personalities. Emmy is excellently portrayed by the wonderful Irish stage actress Patricia Collinge ( you just know it would kill her soul if she knew the truth about her little brother! ) Macdonald Carey was never much of an actor, but here he seems real and genuine as the  man who looking for Oakley while falling in love with his neice in the process.  A local girl was chosen by Hitch to play the younger sister and if she was told to be irritating, boy, did she succeed!  Cotton is able to convey the surface charm which almost cover the menace within, and  Wright convincingly shows us a naive young woman who finds herself in a situation she could not imagine - much less suspect.

66939,A13IKSGDYNBNQS,0783236352,S J Buck,"[4, 4]","This 1943 thriller from the master of suspense features Joseph Cotton as 'Uncle Charlie' and Teresa Wright as 'Young Charlie'. Cotten having made 'The Magnicent Ambersons' and 'Citizen Kane' with Orsen Welles in the previous two years was early in his career (Shadow of a Doubt was only his 5th film) proving to be a versatile and subtle actor.Arriving to visit his family in California, Uncle Charlie is very popular with all the family, especially 'Young Charlie'. Hitchcock of course is very clever and allows Joseph Cotten to drop a few hints of his posible sinister side. But maybe its a double bluff from the master of suspense. There are many trademark Hitchcock moments, a few lovely set pieces. In fact early in the film he uses a shot that would be recreated in Psycho 18 years later.The script is very good and the cast matches it most of the time with classy acting. Just occasionally I felt that the acting was a little wooden. I couldn't tell you where it happened, which is good because this means I'll have to watch the film again. The DVD has an interesting documentary about the making of the film with some of the surviving members of the cast.For me this wasn't as good as 'North By Northwest', Psycho, Rear Window or 'Strangers on a Train' but it is a very good film, and one that I have only seen once. I am sure that with repeated viewings it will improve each time and regardless of my opinion if Alfred Hitchcock liked above of all his other films it must be worth getting.",4,Hitchcocks favourite movie,1188000000,"08 25, 2007",2007,1498,"['1943', 'thriller', 'master', 'suspense', 'features', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', ""'Uncle"", 'Charlie', 'Teresa', 'Wright', ""'Young"", 'Charlie', 'Cotten', 'having', 'made', ""'The"", 'Magnicent', 'Ambersons', ""'Citizen"", 'Kane', 'Orsen', 'Welles', 'previous', 'two', 'years', 'was', 'early', 'career', 'Shadow', 'Doubt', 'was', 'only', '5th', 'film', 'proving', 'be', 'versatile', 'subtle', 'actor.Arriving', 'visit', 'family', 'California', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'very', 'popular', 'family', 'especially', 'Charlie', 'Hitchcock', 'course', 'very', 'clever', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'drop', 'few', 'hints', 'posible', 'sinister', 'side', 'maybe', 'double', 'bluff', 'master', 'suspense', 'are', 'many', 'trademark', 'Hitchcock', 'moments', 'few', 'lovely', 'set', 'pieces', 'fact', 'early', 'film', 'shot', 'would', 'be', 'recreated', 'Psycho', '18', 'years', 'later.The', 'script', 'very', 'good', 'cast', 'most', 'time', 'classy', 'acting', 'Just', 'occasionally', 'felt', 'acting', 'was', 'little', 'wooden', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'where', 'happened', 'good', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'DVD', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'surviving', 'members', 'cast.For', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', ""'North"", 'Northwest', 'Psycho', 'Rear', 'Window', ""'Strangers"", 'Train', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'one', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'once', 'am', 'sure', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'will', 'improve', 'time', 'regardless', 'opinion', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'liked', 'other', 'films', 'must', 'be', 'worth', 'getting']",N/A
66940,A2F7XTL4KHDZME,0783236352,Stephen Reginald,"[0, 0]","This is one my favorite films of all time, as well as Alfred Hitchcock's personal favorite of all his films. The story is compelling and suspenseful and the acting is among the best you'll see in American cinema. When Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton) visits his sister's family in Santa Rosa, California, from the east (Philadelphia), a series of events that may identify him as ""The Merry Widow Murderer,"" crushes young Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright), his niece, who idolizes him. Wright's journey from a young, innocent girl into a woman who struggles to do the right thing, while protecting her family, is a wonderful study in character development. Wright's performance ranks among the best in American film.  It's her genuine goodness and believability that helps make this film so successful. Cotton manages to be absolutely chilling and charming at the same time. It's hard to believe that his performance was overlooked at Oscar time in 1943. Hitchcock couldn't have assembled a better cast of supporting players: Hume Cronyn (his film debut), MacDonald Carey, Henry Travers (made immortal as Clarence the angel in It's a Wonderful Life), Patricia Collinge, and Wallace Ford. The character roles are wonderfully drawn, each actor giving memorable performances. Collinge is particularly effective as Wright's mother and Cotton's older sister. The camera work, always excellent in Hitchcock films, is exemplary here, from the opening sequences, that sets the scene without any dialogue, to the wonderful climax aboard a train. Thornton Wilder (the author of Our Town) and Sally Benson (Meet Me in St. Louis) cowrote the screenplay, peppering it with small town touches, and contrasting it against the evil of Uncle Charlie. And take note of all the doubling and twos. Young Charlie, Old Charlie, Till Two Tavern, where the waitress has been working there for two weeks, two train sequences, two important dinners at the Newton home, two celebratory toast, and on and on. This film gets better with each viewing. If you get the opportunity to see it on the big screen, by all means do so. I did at a recent Hitchcock film festival in Philly and it was like seeing it for the first time.  The DVD extras are great.  The documentary on the making of the film is very interesting, with probably, one of the last interviews about the film that Teresa Wright gave before her death.  The commentary along with the film is also interesting to film buffs and Hitchcock fans.Shadow of a Doubt",5,"No Doubts Here, April 7, 2008 (DVD)",966211200,"08 14, 2000",2000,2485,"['one', 'favorite', 'films', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'personal', 'favorite', 'films', 'story', 'compelling', 'suspenseful', 'acting', 'best', ""'ll"", 'see', 'American', 'cinema', 'When', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', 'sister', 'family', 'Santa', 'Rosa', 'California', 'east', 'Philadelphia', 'series', 'events', 'may', 'identify', 'Merry', 'Widow', 'Murderer', 'young', 'Charlie', 'Newton', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'niece', 'who', 'Wright', 'journey', 'young', 'innocent', 'girl', 'woman', 'who', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'protecting', 'family', 'wonderful', 'study', 'character', 'development', 'Wright', 'performance', 'ranks', 'best', 'American', 'film', 'genuine', 'goodness', 'believability', 'make', 'film', 'so', 'successful', 'Cotton', 'be', 'absolutely', 'chilling', 'charming', 'same', 'time', 'hard', 'believe', 'performance', 'was', 'overlooked', 'Oscar', 'time', '1943', 'Hitchcock', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'assembled', 'better', 'cast', 'supporting', 'players', 'Hume', 'Cronyn', 'film', 'debut', 'MacDonald', 'Carey', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'made', 'immortal', 'Clarence', 'angel', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Patricia', 'Collinge', 'Wallace', 'Ford', 'character', 'roles', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'drawn', 'actor', 'giving', 'memorable', 'performances', 'Collinge', 'particularly', 'effective', 'Wright', 'mother', 'Cotton', 'older', 'sister', 'camera', 'work', 'always', 'excellent', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'exemplary', 'here', 'opening', 'sequences', 'scene', 'dialogue', 'wonderful', 'climax', 'train', 'Thornton', 'Wilder', 'author', 'Town', 'Sally', 'Benson', 'Meet', 'Me', 'St.', 'Louis', 'cowrote', 'screenplay', 'peppering', 'small', 'town', 'touches', 'contrasting', 'evil', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'take', 'note', 'doubling', 'twos', 'Young', 'Charlie', 'Old', 'Charlie', 'Till', 'Two', 'Tavern', 'where', 'waitress', 'been', 'working', 'there', 'two', 'weeks', 'two', 'train', 'sequences', 'two', 'important', 'dinners', 'Newton', 'home', 'two', 'celebratory', 'toast', 'film', 'better', 'viewing', 'get', 'opportunity', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'means', 'do', 'so', 'did', 'recent', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'festival', 'Philly', 'was', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'great', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'very', 'interesting', 'probably', 'one', 'last', 'interviews', 'film', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'gave', 'death', 'commentary', 'film', 'also', 'interesting', 'film', 'buffs', 'Hitchcock', 'fans.Shadow', 'Doubt']",N/A

There is nothing groundbreaking to the film and there are no classic moments in it. Janet Leigh is not stabbed to death while showering in this film. Cary Grant is not buzzed by an airplane in this film. Claude Rains does not walk up a staircase in terror in this film. All we get this time around is a serial killer story that is full of routine moments.Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton) visits his niece, Charlie (Teresa Wright). Charlie the niece adores the uncle she is named after and is overjoyed that he will be spending time at her home. Soon after, detectives show up at the doorstep believing that Uncle Charlie is the culprit behind a series of grisly murders. Charlie then becomes suspicious herself of her uncle and eventually does discover whether he is a guilty or innocent man. Fate then intervenes into the lives of the two Charlies when they board the same train and meet their respective destinies.Cotton and Wright are great in their roles but the story of &quot;Shadow of the Doubt&quot; is just too generic to be memorable. Its critique of the darker aspects of small-town life and the nature of gender identity is interesting on an analytical level, but adds little to the overall entertainment value of the film. In fact, precious little contributes to the entertainment value of &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; - the pacing drags, the detectives in the film are too simple-minded to be credible, the romantic subplot with the female Charlie feels manufactured, and any suspense involving the identity of the serial killer is gutted immediately at the film's outset. Thankfully, Hitchcock is much better remembered for other films he previously and subsequently directed to this one. &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; is simply not one of his better efforts.",2,"&quot;Charlie, think.

It is almost theatre like.But it was that era where we were leaving the Greta-Garbo-like movies where people were putting their wrists to their foreheads as if they were going to faint and the men were well painted in the face with makeup to more realistic acting and movie sets.

I couldn't tell if they were trying to make this unpredictable or if they just didn't know when to stop. I saw about two endings that would have made this a fine movie.

Read those three in their entireties.What stands out for me after watching this movie is the seductive and wholesome portrayal of Santa Rosa. Time has also given this film nostalgic value, deepening the American romance with small-town life. The details all work to make us feel comfortable in this town, down to the traffic cop who knows the names and whereabouts of everyone who lives in his town, the severe but helpful librarian, the lovely white house with its big porch and lawns, and the dinner scenes where all the (girl) children help their mother serve the mashed potatoes. The further we move in time from this movie, the more powerful its image of innocence becomes. The contribution of co-writer Thornton Wilder (Our Town) is very evident here.The perfection of the location makes the arrival of Uncle Charley (played brilliantly by Joseph Cotten) all the more ominous. Ominous is what this movie is really good at. Outside of Santa Rosa all is confusion, as shown when a panicky Young Charlie is unable to locate her rescuer (the detective Jack Graham) at any of the addresses he's left with her. The ties between Santa Rosa and the rest of America remain tenuous. In the end, the battle between good and evil does seem to get resolved, but an allusion to the ""crazy world"" outside of Santa Rosa in the last scene, reminds us that this resolution is not meant to be felt as final. There is a ""ghost world"" outside the comfort of Santa Rosa that is its physical double, just as Uncle Charley shadows Young Charlie. It's in that world where the film significantly begins even if it's not where it ends.In sum, that beautiful white house has both a front stairs and a back one.

Set in the Northern California town of Santa Rosa, Shadow of a Doubt is most subversive about the very normal, tranquil qualities of small town life. Like all of Hitchcock's most convincing and powerful thrillers, the mystery is revealed right away. Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton)is on the run from the police. He's endearing, charming and a serial killer nicknamed The Merry Widow Murderer. With the police hot on his trail he turns to the only place he can--home.Uncle Charlie visits with his sister and her family in a sleepy small town. Uncle Charlie gets the chance to visit with his namesake and favorite niece nicknamed Young Charlie (Teresa Wright). They have a grand old name visiting until the past comes haunting. Young Charlie begins to suspect that Uncle Charlie is the Merry Window Murderer. What's worse, he realizes that she knows. Suddenly, he must find a way to murder his favorite niece and escape without suspicion.Shadow is one of Hitchcock's earliest films where his favorite themes finally come together in a great collabortive effort with Thornton Wilder (Our Town). Wilder's early drafts (Hitchcock's wife and frequent collaborator Alma Reville did extensive rewrites along with Sally Benson and, of course, Hitchcock himself, as always, uncredited). Like many of the releases from Universal in the Alfred Hitchcock Collection, Shadow comes back with some interesting extras.The documentary  which includes interviews with Teresa Wright, Hume Cronyn, Robert Boyle, Pat Hitchcock O'Connell and director Peter Bogdanovich, isn't the usual slapdash affair. There's some interesting insights and observations about the film (if you'd like real insight into the film, I'd suggest the recent Hitchcock biography).Joseph Cotton, Teresa Wright and the rest of this stunning cast capture the atmosphere (or least Hollywood's version of it with a bit more realism courtesy of Wilder and Hitchcock)of life in a small town during the 40's. It's one of Hitchcock's early American masterpieces (along with the wonderful Notorious).The transfer looks pretty good overall. There are some minor issues with edge enhancement but the overall look of the film is very clean considering the age of the negative. It's a pity that so many Hitchcock films are spread over so many studios.

Over-the-top performances by Teresa Wright (on a loss-of-innocence journey) and Joseph Cotton (on the run as a serial killer who is also a close family relative).  There is a play-off between melodrama and suspense that just keeps building.  Up to the last few reels, doubt lingers as to who really is the serial killer (the script could go in at least two directions).  Film score by Dimitri Tiomkin is a knockout underlining and amplifying the unrelenting tension.  Hitchcock experimented with overlapping and simultaneous dialog to good (often amusing) effect.  There are a few plot discrepancies (such as an apparently free telegram service and detectives who prefer to do just about anything except make an arrest); Hitchcock's continuing fixation on trains (coming and going); and an exaggerated, station-platform shadow ""cast"" by an arriving train (carrying Cotton's character into the small town where Wright's character and her family live).

Joseph Cotten, generally accustomed to playing suave, likeable figures portrays a sociopath who hates society, and has no compunctions about killing.  His targets for death are rich widows.  He rationalizes that there is nothing wrong about killing them since they are spending money left to them by their deceased husbands that they do not deserve.  The world is a sick, warped place to Cotten, and he sees nothing wrong in grabbing every advantage he can with no remorse.As is often the case with sociopaths such as Cotten, they can also be thoroughly charming.  How else do they trap their victims?  We see Cotten weave his spell over one widow, whose life was probably only ultimately spared by the end of Cotten's activities.Initially Cotten's niece, like him, also called Charlie, and played by Teresa Wright in one of her most enduring roles, sees only the charming, debonair, joyously witty side of the man she calls her &quot;favorite uncle.&quot;  When he comes west to stay for awhile with his sister and family, however, Wright little by little begins piecing together the real Uncle Charlie.  He lets down his guard and tells him his warped view of human existence, which he considers hopelessly depraved.Uncle Charlie is suspected of being the &quot;Merry Widow Killer&quot; of wealthy widows and the manhunt results in FBI agent McDonald Carey being assigned to investigate Cotten.  He is quickly taken by the charms of Ms. Wright.  At first when he seeks her cooperation in learning more about her uncle, she becomes incensed, but as she learns more about him, her opposition ends and she helps Carey in his pursuit.The film ends with a brilliantly filmed train sequence which, from the standpoint of stark visual imagery, is reminiscent of the closing sequence with the merry-go-round in &quot;Strangers on a Train.&quot;  Wright finds herself confronted by a desperate Cotten, who realizes that she is the one person he must silence if he is to continue his existence of preying upon vulnerable widows and ultimately killing them.",5,When Love Turns to Terrifying Fear,1011398400,"01 19, 2002",2002,2169,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'top', 'game', 'quot', 'Shadow', 'Doubt', 'quot', 'one', 'all-time', 'personal', 'favorites', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'generally', 'accustomed', 'playing', 'suave', 'likeable', 'figures', 'sociopath', 'who', 'society', 'compunctions', 'killing', 'targets', 'death', 'are', 'rich', 'widows', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'killing', 'are', 'spending', 'money', 'left', 'deceased', 'husbands', 'do', 'not', 'deserve', 'world', 'sick', 'warped', 'place', 'Cotten', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'grabbing', 'advantage', 'can', 'remorse.As', 'often', 'case', 'sociopaths', 'such', 'Cotten', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'charming', 'How', 'else', 'do', 'trap', 'victims', 'see', 'Cotten', 'weave', 'spell', 'one', 'widow', 'life', 'was', 'probably', 'only', 'ultimately', 'spared', 'end', 'Cotten', 'activities.Initially', 'Cotten', 'niece', 'also', 'called', 'Charlie', 'played', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'one', 'most', 'enduring', 'roles', 'only', 'charming', 'debonair', 'joyously', 'witty', 'side', 'man', 'quot', 'favorite', 'uncle.', 'quot', 'When', 'west', 'stay', 'awhile', 'sister', 'family', 'however', 'Wright', 'little', 'little', 'begins', 'piecing', 'together', 'real', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'down', 'guard', 'warped', 'view', 'human', 'existence', 'hopelessly', 'depraved.Uncle', 'Charlie', 'suspected', 'being', 'quot', 'Merry', 'Widow', 'Killer', 'quot', 'wealthy', 'widows', 'manhunt', 'results', 'FBI', 'agent', 'McDonald', 'Carey', 'being', 'assigned', 'investigate', 'Cotten', 'quickly', 'taken', 'charms', 'Ms.', 'Wright', 'first', 'when', 'cooperation', 'learning', 'more', 'uncle', 'incensed', 'more', 'opposition', 'ends', 'Carey', 'pursuit.The', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'filmed', 'train', 'sequence', 'standpoint', 'stark', 'visual', 'imagery', 'reminiscent', 'closing', 'sequence', 'merry-go-round', 'quot', 'Strangers', 'Train.', 'quot', 'Wright', 'confronted', 'desperate', 'Cotten', 'who', 'one', 'person', 'must', 'silence', 'continue', 'existence', 'preying', 'vulnerable', 'widows', 'ultimately', 'killing']",N/A

I find that hard to believe -- not hard to beleive that he said but, rather, hard to believe he meant it.  There are any number of actors who have done their best work in Hitchcock films: Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, Martin Balsam, Anthony Perkins; and of course Joseph Cotton and Theresa Wright.From what I gather, quality actors longed to be in a Hitchcok movie because they had great confidence in him.  He knew what he wanted and knew how to get it.  Such confidence in a director must give the entire acting ensemble a tremendous amount of confidence as well; actors, famous or otherwise, being notoriously insecure.Notice in ""Shadow of a Doubt,"" as is true in all of Hitchcock's movies,how Hitchcok shocks and frightens and intrigues and mesmerized, but with a minimum of so-called ""action.""  Meaning: no car chases, no shoot 'em ups, no bombastic violence.Even the famous shower scene in ""Psycho"" is shot-for-shot all referential.  We see the knife, we see Janet Leigh's face, we see the blood, the shower curtain falling -- but we don't see these things in a graphic, haphazard, unstylized way.  Violence in a movie, if it's stylized as well as ""visually indirect,"" becomes something other than violence.  Put another way: everything flows form the director and the actors, the FX crew is marginalized.Here's the bottom line for ""Shadow of a Doubt."" ...

Fortunately, ""Shadow of a Doubt"" is a much more visceral tale dealing with the loss of innocence and small-town life.For a basic plot summary, ""Shadow of a Doubt"" sees Charlie (Joseph Cotten) on the run from the police in New York.  Charlie evades the law by catching a train to the West Coast and hunkering down with his family in California, who know nothing of his shady past and view him as almost a sort of saint.  However, Charlie's namesake niece (Teresa Wright) starts to piece together what Charlie is up to, putting both herself, her family, and the entire town in potential danger.This film is a better Hitch effort because of its insistent themes.  Though because the time period was one of more restraint when it came to controversial themes at the box office, ""Shadow of a Doubt"" manages to still create a creepy atmosphere that at times is very uncomfortable.  The idyllic community myth is shattered by the likes of characters like Charlie, who uses lies and manipulation to continue a spree of lawlessness.  These themes could be done much more prominently and grittier in today's Hollywood, but in the early 1940s the hints were likely enough to put viewers in a suspenseful mood.Overall, then, ""Shadow of a Doubt"" is a solid Hitchcock flick that easily deserves a watch from fans of Hitch.
