Pawl ""Dani""","[10, 10]","I remember the first time I was introduced to Burns & Allen (the brilliant married duo of George Burns and his wife Gracie Allen),  Between George's dry wit and Gracie's brilliantly orchestrated ditziness they were quite the pair.  Plus, the early episodes feature incidental visits from the Carnation Milk spokesman, who shows up while Gracie is serving coffee to guests, or any time, really.  This is the spokesperson's opportunity to sell the condensed milk from the contented Carnation cows, magically produces a pineapple upside down cake out of his briefcase, or adds the perfect touch of milk to Gracie's tea.  Plus, there are the great co-stars.  Their neighbors, Harry (John Brown, and then Fred Clark) and Blanche (Bea Benaderet) Morton are constantly bickering and rolling their eyes at Gracie's antics.  Believe me, there are many antics, too.  I don't even know where to begin!  The quality of these episodes is not ""high"" in comparison to the technology of today, but is quite standard for the television shows of the 1950s.  They were preserved on kinescope.  This meant that a recording was made directly off of a television screen, hence, there is an ovular look to the scope of the picture, and some of the scenery appears quite cut off.  Nevertheless, these shows are wonderful.  I encourage you to watch these, to see how George Burns got his start on television, before he went solo with his wisecracking shenanigans.  Yes, he smoked a cigar back then, too.",5,"""Say Good-night, Gracie.""",1181606400,"06 12, 2007",2007,1478,"['remember', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'introduced', 'Burns', 'Allen', 'brilliant', 'married', 'duo', 'George', 'Burns', 'wife', 'Gracie', 'Allen', 'Between', 'George', 'dry', 'wit', 'Gracie', 'brilliantly', 'orchestrated', 'ditziness', 'were', 'quite', 'pair', 'early', 'episodes', 'feature', 'incidental', 'visits', 'Carnation', 'Milk', 'spokesman', 'who', 'up', 'Gracie', 'serving', 'coffee', 'guests', 'time', 'really', 'spokesperson', 'opportunity', 'sell', 'condensed', 'milk', 'contented', 'Carnation', 'cows', 'magically', 'pineapple', 'upside', 'down', 'cake', 'briefcase', 'perfect', 'touch', 'milk', 'Gracie', 'tea', 'are', 'great', 'co-stars', 'neighbors', 'Harry', 'John', 'Brown', 'then', 'Fred', 'Clark', 'Blanche', 'Bea', 'Benaderet', 'Morton', 'are', 'constantly', 'bickering', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'Gracie', 'antics', 'Believe', 'are', 'many', 'antics', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'quality', 'episodes', 'not', 'high', 'comparison', 'technology', 'today', 'quite', 'standard', 'television', 'shows', '1950s', 'were', 'preserved', 'kinescope', 'meant', 'recording', 'was', 'made', 'directly', 'television', 'screen', 'hence', 'ovular', 'look', 'scope', 'picture', 'scenery', 'quite', 'cut', 'off', 'Nevertheless', 'shows', 'are', 'wonderful', 'encourage', 'watch', 'see', 'how', 'George', 'Burns', 'got', 'start', 'television', 'went', 'solo', 'wisecracking', 'shenanigans', 'Yes', 'smoked', 'cigar', 'back', 'then', 'too']","The Best of the Burns and Allen Show, Vol. 1 and 2"

O'Neill ""edwardoneill""","[5, 7]","As a student of TV history, I think I can clarify something.Some writing here love the later Burns and Allen shows for their marvelous wit.Those episodes were shot on film and thus have a better visual quality.They were NOT, however, as experimental or strange as the earlier episodes--which are the ones I, and some others, enjoy more.The earlier live shows were indeed still playing with the format.  George would address the audience more.  He would walk through the invisible 'walls' of the set, refer to the camera, and other strange shenanigans.In addition, musical numbers would crop up in odd places--right in the middle of scenes or monologues with little justification--and the 'ads,' such as they were, were just incorporated right into the show.I find all this stuff amazing--exactly because it was not the norm later.For those who love the earlier, more experimental, live shows, the later filmed episodes are merely watered-down.And for those who love the later episodes as unusual compared to other sitcoms, the earlier live episodes are merely strange or even a botch.Chacun a son gout.--Edward R.

859657,A3GUQ6WST3DR6Y,B00064AM9Y,Jennifer Cole,"[49, 50]","After some of the other comments, I feel I must begin with a word about picture quality.  As another reviewer pointed out, many of these episodes were broadcast live and preserved only on kinescope, a device that filmed the live image directly off a television screen.  In the very early days of Burns & Allen, TV screens were still round, which is why it often appears the camera-man is chopping off the tops of people's heads, as much of the image is lost in converting a round picture into a square one.  Given this crude manner of preserving the show, the picture quality on this set is probably as well as can be achieved given the source material, and certainly it is at least as clear as the image television audiences saw back in 1950.Having addressed that issue, the show itself is nearly flawless.  If you are a fan of quirky, screwball comedy, this is it at its zenith.  The earlier episodes of this series in particular are some of the best written television comedy ever to be aired, coming to you courtesy of writer Paul Henning, who would later bring us The Beverly Hillbillies, Petticoat Junction, and Green Acres (all three of which, ironically, also featured George and Gracie's next door neighbor Blanche, Bea Benadarette, who would later play Aunt Pearl, Kate Bradley, and the voice of Betty Rubble in The Flintstones).  The incorporation of the Carnation Milk commercials into the story is in keeping the George's constant violation of the fourth wall, aside from his running monologue he often breaks character to address the audience directly.While the episodes on this set are out of order (why??) it will be evident to the novice viewer that the show was of higher quality in the earlier seasons.  After a couple of years, it was filmed instead of performed live before an audience, and there is a distinct element of the formula missing in these episodes.  Nonetheless, Burns and Allen remains one of my favorite TV shows of all time from ANY era; for the reasonable price and given the scarcity of TV shows of this time period that are even available on DVD, this one is worth a watch.",5,"Say Goodnight, Gracie",1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,2112,"['other', 'comments', 'feel', 'must', 'begin', 'word', 'picture', 'quality', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'many', 'episodes', 'were', 'broadcast', 'live', 'preserved', 'only', 'kinescope', 'device', 'filmed', 'live', 'image', 'directly', 'television', 'screen', 'very', 'early', 'days', 'Burns', 'Allen', 'TV', 'screens', 'were', 'still', 'round', 'why', 'often', 'camera-man', 'chopping', 'off', 'tops', 'people', 'heads', 'much', 'image', 'lost', 'converting', 'round', 'picture', 'square', 'one', 'Given', 'crude', 'manner', 'preserving', 'show', 'picture', 'quality', 'set', 'probably', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'be', 'achieved', 'given', 'source', 'material', 'certainly', 'least', 'as', 'clear', 'image', 'television', 'audiences', 'saw', 'back', '1950.Having', 'addressed', 'issue', 'show', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'are', 'fan', 'quirky', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'zenith', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'series', 'particular', 'are', 'best', 'written', 'television', 'comedy', 'ever', 'be', 'aired', 'coming', 'courtesy', 'writer', 'Paul', 'Henning', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'bring', 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies', 'Petticoat', 'Junction', 'Green', 'Acres', 'three', 'ironically', 'also', 'featured', 'George', 'Gracie', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Blanche', 'Bea', 'Benadarette', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'play', 'Aunt', 'Pearl', 'Kate', 'Bradley', 'voice', 'Betty', 'Rubble', 'Flintstones', 'incorporation', 'Carnation', 'Milk', 'commercials', 'story', 'keeping', 'George', 'constant', 'violation', 'fourth', 'wall', 'aside', 'running', 'monologue', 'often', 'character', 'address', 'audience', 'episodes', 'set', 'are', 'order', 'why', 'will', 'be', 'evident', 'novice', 'viewer', 'show', 'was', 'higher', 'quality', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'couple', 'years', 'was', 'filmed', 'instead', 'performed', 'live', 'audience', 'distinct', 'element', 'formula', 'missing', 'episodes', 'Nonetheless', 'Burns', 'Allen', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', 'shows', 'time', 'ANY', 'era', 'reasonable', 'price', 'given', 'scarcity', 'TV', 'shows', 'time', 'period', 'are', 'even', 'available', 'DVD', 'one', 'watch']","The Best of the Burns and Allen Show, Vol. 1 and 2"

As a die hard fan of the show, who watched the episodes in the late 1970's like all college kids did back then, I can tell you now - these are NOT those eoisodes. These are like the first seaeon (1951) where they were experimenting on the format, every episode is in terrible condition, and have the Carnation milk commercials during each episode making them even worse, if that's possible. These are NOT the slick episodes where George sees all of Gracies schemes on a TV in his den over the Garage, or where Gracie takes every man's hat and puts them in a closet where they end up forever. Those black and white episodes looked like new. If the last couple of season's worth of episodes, from the late 1950's were sold on DVD, in episode order, sans commercials, that were repeated on Ch. 9 in New York City in the late 1970's they would make millions. They were GENIOUS. They made you laugh so hard, your stomach hurt. That's the Burns & Allen Show I remember and loved. They were even funnier than the Honeymooners and that's a bold statement.
