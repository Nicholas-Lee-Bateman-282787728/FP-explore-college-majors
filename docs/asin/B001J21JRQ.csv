1205010,AFYYHRPSFBLWS,B001J21JRQ,Ash Ryan,"[2, 2]","Letting Go of God is a very interesting and entertaining stage monologue about how Julia Sweeney becomes discontented with the religion she grew up with, and goes on a spiritual quest---eventually ending up as a contented atheist.Unlike many other atheist comedians' takes on religion, this is not an anti-religious tirade.  It's just Julia Sweeney telling her own story in a genuine and thoughtful way.Sweeney was brought up as a Catholic, but she also touches on several other religions, from Mormonism to Buddhism.  But ultimately, blind faith in anything that doesn't make sense upon close scrutiny doesn't satisfy her.  This is the story of a woman who is wholly devoted to discovering the truth.This leads her on a surprising journey, ultimately turning to a scientific worldview (after a brief detour having to learn to discern between genuine science and the New Age pseudo-science of the likes of Deepak Chopra).  Philosophically, Letting Go of God is very good.  One of my favorite parts was her rejection of the Christian concept of the atonement---I could identify with this, because her problems with this issue were the same reasons that eventually led me to take my own quest, which mirrored hers (questioning my faith and learning to judge for myself the validity and soundness of various ideologies, finally discovering a naturalistic philosophy).In short, Sweeney is both admirable and hilarious.  I highly recommend this engaging performance to anyone interested in these issues.  I have it on CD as well, but the DVD is even better when you can watch it.

She brushes with several religions and major alternate religion writers and speakers. However she stays mainstream enough that you should be familiar with all of the references, some of which are just mentioned in passing.However she really only touches on the window dressing or superficial part of each religion or speaker and avoids any of the deeper or real focus of the religion.  So long as you are not aware of the depth of the particular religion or writer in her critique you can laugh and not think much. She does focus more on Catholicism, LDS, and Buddhism. One writer mentioned but glossed over is Joseph Campbell who has a great body of works and all she remembered is ""Follow Your Bliss."" Transcendental Meditation"" if anyone remembers it got about four words; this could be a time restraint of the presentation.One part that I particularly found interesting was when Julia took a course in quantum mechanics she found that people bandying around scientific words and trying to equate them to off the wall religions had no concept of physics and was found out to be full of it. If more people took the time to take a course in quantum mechanics people like Gary Zukav would starve to death.You may agree or disagree with Julia.

For those who have found it to be otherwise, there are people like Julia Sweeney.For those who might remember Julia Sweeney as the metasexual""It's Pat!""skits on Saturday Night Live, this live performance might surprise you. It's extremely intelligently written, thoughtful and continuously compelling. And though it is about a serious subject, it's always handled with wit and a terrific sense of humor.Over the course of a delightful two hours, Sweeney details her gradual digression from religion through a hilarious monologue that begins on what she then believed to be her 7th birthday, but then devolves into revelations about Santa, her birthday, and astrological signs; and then over the years became realizations about boyfriends, Bible study, the Old Testament vs. the New Testament, scientific research, and more.But really, the biggest TRUTH here was simply this: that she began examining the Bible and its teachings with open eyes and an open mind. And in doing so she began to realize the Bible that she had always believed in was rife with contradictions and even dangerous declarations.By looking deeply at what's written in the Bible - some of which are everyday stories and dialogues - Sweeney examined such topics as women's roles, slavery, what Jesus said about the family and the approaching apocalypse, and discovered much of what she had always thought about the Bible to be unable to stand up to close scrutiny, even when looked at metaphorically. Finding the Catholic Church to be failed in principle, she became open to everything: Buddhism, Deepak Choprah, Intelligent Design...heck, she was even nice to door-to-door Seventh Day Adventists! She read all sorts of literature and traveled the world...literally. And what she learned was, for her, religion just didn't hold up to examination.For many of us religion is a personal topic, and the question of God's existence or God's role in our lives is not often discussed. And, while a recent poll stated that many Americans consider themselves as ""spiritual,"" these same people have not done enough examination to go to church, let alone even PICK a church.Yet here Sweeney is, discussing those questions about her faith openly. And though there are many opportunity for laughs within this two hour monologue, she cannot be faulted for not taking those questions seriously. In fact, as you'll hear, her research is quite exhaustive. Yet the deeper she dives the the deeper her doubt.Sweeney has a terrific line: ""The invisible and the non-existent often look very much alike."" Thus, she finds that her beliefs transformed from what she discovers. In fact, she finds now that she believes in a field where these deeper examinations are highly welcome: science. To Sweeney, true science seemed to embrace a questioning mind, and encouraged disagreement.Through it all, Sweeney never loses her sense of humor.She expressed her own anger when her religious doubts were ""outed"" in a newspaper carried in her home town under a headline calling her an atheist. She said she felt shock at being seen in this regard, claiming they had no right to label her so severely: she said she felt ""It was one thing not to believe in God, but being an atheist was ANOTHER THING ALTOGETHER.""Of course, when her parents saw the story they were furious. While her mother's initial reaction was, ""This doesn't mean you stopped going to church, does it?""; her father told her in no uncertain terms how disappointed in her he was, and in fact told her she could no longer go to his funeral. To this end Sweeney said she hung up the phone and muttered, ""I'd like to see him try!""LETTING GO OF GOD is a clear, detailed, thorough and altogether entertaining examination of one woman's quest for answers to serious questions about her faith.  Enter it with an open mind and I believe you'll find that it will make you think. I don't believe her aim here is to persuade Christians into becoming atheists. Instead, it is her own personal tale about how she evolved, on how she eventually believed she had to ""let go"" of her old beliefs when they no longer suited her. It's a subtle difference, but worth the listen...it's two hours most of you will NOT regret.",5,A Hilarious and Intellectual Search for a System of Belief,1373846400,"07 15, 2013",2013,4277,"['who', 'find', 'God', 'ever', 'present', 'lives', 'congratulations', 'who', 'have', 'found', 'be', 'otherwise', 'are', 'people', 'Julia', 'Sweeney.For', 'who', 'might', 'remember', 'Julia', 'Sweeney', 'metasexual', 'Pat', 'skits', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'live', 'performance', 'might', 'surprise', 'extremely', 'intelligently', 'written', 'thoughtful', 'continuously', 'compelling', 'serious', 'subject', 'always', 'handled', 'wit', 'terrific', 'sense', 'humor.Over', 'course', 'delightful', 'two', 'hours', 'Sweeney', 'details', 'gradual', 'digression', 'religion', 'hilarious', 'monologue', 'what', 'then', 'believed', 'be', '7th', 'birthday', 'then', 'revelations', 'Santa', 'birthday', 'astrological', 'signs', 'then', 'years', 'became', 'realizations', 'boyfriends', 'Bible', 'study', 'Old', 'Testament', 'New', 'Testament', 'scientific', 'research', 'more.But', 'really', 'biggest', 'TRUTH', 'here', 'was', 'simply', 'began', 'examining', 'Bible', 'teachings', 'open', 'eyes', 'open', 'mind', 'doing', 'so', 'began', 'realize', 'Bible', 'had', 'always', 'believed', 'was', 'rife', 'contradictions', 'even', 'dangerous', 'declarations.By', 'looking', 'deeply', 'what', 'written', 'Bible', 'are', 'everyday', 'stories', 'dialogues', 'Sweeney', 'examined', 'such', 'topics', 'women', 'roles', 'slavery', 'what', 'Jesus', 'said', 'family', 'approaching', 'apocalypse', 'discovered', 'much', 'what', 'had', 'always', 'thought', 'Bible', 'be', 'unable', 'stand', 'up', 'close', 'scrutiny', 'even', 'when', 'looked', 'metaphorically', 'Finding', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'be', 'failed', 'principle', 'became', 'open', 'everything', 'Buddhism', 'Deepak', 'Choprah', 'Intelligent', 'Design', 'heck', 'was', 'even', 'nice', 'door-to-door', 'Seventh', 'Day', 'Adventists', 'read', 'sorts', 'literature', 'traveled', 'world', 'literally', 'what', 'learned', 'was', 'religion', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'examination.For', 'many', 'religion', 'personal', 'topic', 'question', 'God', 'existence', 'God', 'role', 'lives', 'not', 'often', 'discussed', 'recent', 'poll', 'stated', 'many', 'Americans', 'consider', 'spiritual', 'same', 'people', 'have', 'not', 'done', 'enough', 'examination', 'go', 'church', 'let', 'alone', 'even', 'PICK', 'church.Yet', 'here', 'Sweeney', 'discussing', 'questions', 'faith', 'openly', 'are', 'many', 'opportunity', 'laughs', 'two', 'hour', 'monologue', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'faulted', 'not', 'taking', 'questions', 'seriously', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'research', 'quite', 'exhaustive', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'doubt.Sweeney', 'terrific', 'line', 'invisible', 'non-existent', 'often', 'look', 'very', 'much', 'alike', 'Thus', 'beliefs', 'transformed', 'what', 'fact', 'now', 'field', 'where', 'deeper', 'examinations', 'are', 'highly', 'welcome', 'science', 'Sweeney', 'true', 'science', 'seemed', 'embrace', 'questioning', 'mind', 'encouraged', 'Sweeney', 'never', 'sense', 'humor.She', 'expressed', 'own', 'anger', 'when', 'religious', 'doubts', 'were', 'outed', 'newspaper', 'carried', 'home', 'town', 'headline', 'calling', 'atheist', 'said', 'felt', 'shock', 'being', 'seen', 'regard', 'claiming', 'had', 'right', 'label', 'so', 'severely', 'said', 'felt', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'not', 'believe', 'God', 'being', 'atheist', 'was', 'ANOTHER', 'THING', 'ALTOGETHER', 'course', 'when', 'parents', 'saw', 'story', 'were', 'furious', 'mother', 'initial', 'reaction', 'was', ""n't"", 'mean', 'stopped', 'going', 'church', 'father', 'told', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'how', 'disappointed', 'was', 'fact', 'told', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'go', 'funeral', 'end', 'Sweeney', 'said', 'hung', 'up', 'phone', 'muttered', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'try', 'LETTING', 'GO', 'OF', 'GOD', 'clear', 'detailed', 'thorough', 'altogether', 'entertaining', 'examination', 'one', 'woman', 'quest', 'answers', 'serious', 'questions', 'faith', 'Enter', 'open', 'mind', 'believe', ""'ll"", 'find', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'aim', 'here', 'persuade', 'Christians', 'becoming', 'atheists', 'Instead', 'own', 'personal', 'tale', 'how', 'evolved', 'how', 'eventually', 'believed', 'had', 'let', 'go', 'old', 'beliefs', 'when', 'no', 'longer', 'suited', 'subtle', 'difference', 'listen', 'two', 'hours', 'most', 'will', 'NOT', 'regret']",N/A

I was wowed then - I am wowed now. Julia injects her story of how she ""lost"" her faith with such humor and humanity that one often forgets just how dire and dour this story must have been - and must be - for Julia herself. Unlike the polemic of Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins - or the cool, scientific candor of Jonathan Miller and his 'Rough (Brief) History of Disbelief' - Julia's story seems to me to be much less divisive than the above mentioned authors managed to produce. For all its charms, it is every bit as incendiary as that of Dawkins, Hitchens, Miller et. al. but far subtler - as subtle as the ""b"" in subtle. Take another look at the last scene in the monologue between Julia and her daughter. I lived off that scene for days after I first saw the show in NYC and was struck again upon viewing the DVD - just how perfectly written and radical - yes, radical - that scene actually is. Good on you Julia - you are brave, honest and true and one of my heroes. In a world so consumed by superstition, hucksterism and nonsense - you gave us your truth - a remarkable gift and yet another voice to join the ranks of so many others - especially today - who aren't (and weren't) afraid to tell it.

It is a testament to Sweeney's artistry that a segment of ""Letting Go of God"" is among the most popular and best-responded-to segments ever played on NPR's ""This American Life"" show.A book coming out in the next couple of months, ""Losing My Religion,"" gives Sweeney a good deal of credit through this show for identifying and articulating the peculiar feelings and thoughts that accompany a gradual disillusionment with religious faith and equally gradual realization of rationality's importance.This is not a perfect work, but it's a damned fine one, and in some ways succeeds where Bill Maher's documentary ""Religulous"" could not.  That is because Sweeney makes herself both the subject and the object of the story and with a sweet vulnerability explores her own path rather than merely pointing fingers and laughing at those pathetic losers who somehow manage to believe such awful junk.  Only those of us who know the full extent of religion's appeal can feel really justified in both criticizing its veracity and defending people for  being attracted to it despite its gross implausibility.Sweeney goes to the head of the class in this crucial regard.",4,Sweeney is a true treasure.,1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,1372,"['Sweeney', 'perhaps', 'finally', 'getting', 'recognition', 'monologist', 'unique', 'talent', 'tackling', 'issues', 'such', 'illness', 'loss', 'faith', 'few', 'artists', 'could', 'handle', 'deftly', 'wryly', 'testament', 'Sweeney', 'artistry', 'segment', 'Letting', 'Go', 'God', 'most', 'popular', 'best-responded-to', 'segments', 'ever', 'played', 'NPR', 'American', 'Life', 'show.A', 'book', 'coming', 'out', 'next', 'couple', 'months', 'Losing', 'My', 'Religion', 'Sweeney', 'good', 'deal', 'credit', 'show', 'identifying', 'articulating', 'peculiar', 'feelings', 'thoughts', 'accompany', 'gradual', 'disillusionment', 'religious', 'faith', 'equally', 'gradual', 'realization', 'rationality', 'importance.This', 'not', 'perfect', 'work', 'damned', 'fine', 'one', 'ways', 'where', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'documentary', 'Religulous', 'could', 'not', 'Sweeney', 'subject', 'object', 'story', 'sweet', 'vulnerability', 'own', 'path', 'rather', 'merely', 'pointing', 'fingers', 'laughing', 'pathetic', 'losers', 'who', 'somehow', 'manage', 'believe', 'such', 'awful', 'junk', 'Only', 'who', 'know', 'full', 'extent', 'religion', 'appeal', 'can', 'feel', 'really', 'justified', 'criticizing', 'veracity', 'defending', 'people', 'being', 'attracted', 'gross', 'implausibility.Sweeney', 'head', 'class', 'crucial', 'regard']",N/A

It's the honest yearning for what was good about her religious upbringing that makes her reluctant, hard-won liberation from it so moving. I asked myself many of the same questions as a teenager & as a young man; and over the following years, I looked for some meaning I could accept without sacrificing reason. For me, it meant relinquishing literal religious belief to myth & metaphor, and realizing (as Julia did) that ethical behavior is not dependent on religious belief -- that in fact, religious belief can often justify highly unethical behavior, when directed at The Other.What really makes this film work, whether you're a religious believer or not, is that it's not presented as a lecture or polemic. It's very much a personal, individual story: ""Here's what happened to me, and here's what I came to think afterwards."" She never tells us what to think or believe, nor does she pretend to have The Answer For Everyone (one size fits all). But in her own quiet, often humorous way, she does invite us to think about the core values & beliefs we probably tend to take for granted as natural laws of the universe, when they're actually just one among many belief systems human beings have created for themselves over the millennia. She takes these questions seriously & so encourages us to do the same. Most importantly, she's asking us to consider the true meaning of our own lives -- what matters most to us, and how we arrive at our own worldviews. Even more, she asks us to examine how much of what we believe is truly ours, and how much is actually what we've been imprinted with by immersion in family & culture. Never strident, she presents a compelling case for a richer, deeper, clear-eyed model of reality, without the necessity of the supernatural. And in doing so, she leaves us with much food for thought.Most highly recommended!",5,"Heartfelt, often hilarious, always thoughtful, ultimately inspiring",1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,2098,"['Having', 'taken', 'similar', 'inward', 'journey', 'decades', 'was', 'already', 'disposed', 'like', 'Julia', 'Sweeney', 'one-woman', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'deeply', 'would', 'resonate', 'precisely', ""n't"", 'take', 'easy', 'facile', 'mocking', 'route', 'honest', 'yearning', 'what', 'was', 'good', 'religious', 'upbringing', 'reluctant', 'hard-won', 'liberation', 'so', 'moving', 'asked', 'many', 'same', 'questions', 'teenager', 'young', 'man', 'following', 'years', 'looked', 'meaning', 'could', 'accept', 'sacrificing', 'reason', 'meant', 'relinquishing', 'literal', 'religious', 'belief', 'myth', 'metaphor', 'realizing', 'Julia', 'did', 'ethical', 'behavior', 'not', 'dependent', 'religious', 'belief', 'fact', 'religious', 'belief', 'can', 'often', 'justify', 'highly', 'unethical', 'behavior', 'when', 'directed', 'Other.What', 'really', 'film', 'work', ""'re"", 'religious', 'believer', 'not', 'not', 'presented', 'lecture', 'polemic', 'very', 'much', 'personal', 'individual', 'story', 'Here', 'what', 'happened', 'here', 'what', 'came', 'think', 'afterwards', 'never', 'what', 'think', 'believe', 'pretend', 'have', 'Answer', 'Everyone', 'one', 'size', 'own', 'quiet', 'often', 'humorous', 'way', 'invite', 'think', 'core', 'values', 'beliefs', 'probably', 'tend', 'take', 'granted', 'natural', 'laws', 'universe', 'when', ""'re"", 'actually', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'belief', 'systems', 'human', 'beings', 'have', 'created', 'millennia', 'questions', 'seriously', 'so', 'do', 'same', 'Most', 'importantly', 'asking', 'consider', 'true', 'meaning', 'own', 'lives', 'what', 'most', 'how', 'arrive', 'own', 'worldviews', 'Even', 'more', 'examine', 'how', 'much', 'what', 'believe', 'truly', 'ours', 'how', 'much', 'actually', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'imprinted', 'immersion', 'family', 'culture', 'Never', 'strident', 'compelling', 'case', 'richer', 'deeper', 'clear-eyed', 'model', 'reality', 'necessity', 'supernatural', 'doing', 'so', 'much', 'food', 'thought.Most', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
