797098,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00019PDLQ,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[5, 8]","*sobbing*...I cried...I sob for this anime...because I spend nearly 100 bucks on this whole series and I'm never gonna get `em back. *sobs*~SERIES REVIEW~Bring out the tissues and let your feelings go haywire with a lack of reason, because I am going to review what some otaku proclaimed to be the saddest anime series ever seen.  This is ""SAIKANO"", or what's called to certain fans as ""Saishu-Heiki Kanojo"", or ""She, The Ultimate Weapon.""  It's a dark, unfair romance series that deals with the consequences when merging the facts of love and war.  Yep, if you were expecting a shed of light and hope in this anime, you won't find it.  If there's an anime that can actually make me shed a tear, I had the curiosity to be the judge of that.  Seven months and four DVDs later, the only tears I shed for this series are tears of exhaustion.There's a war going on in ""SAIKANO."" It's every country in the world against Japan.  The conceptual focus is on a small redneck town of Hokkaido, where Shuji, the main nerd, narrates the story on his first real relationship with a timid height-deficient girl, Chise.  (Their faces remind me of young putty versions of Ren&eacute;e Zellweger and Jeff Goldblum.)  By the end of their first date, they act clumsy, premature, and uncertain about their irreconcilable relationship,  but when they kiss in the open night, they knew they are in love.  Later, Shu-chan was having a fun visit to the mall in Sapporo with his friends.  The enemy planes bombs the city, killing countless lives. In the aftermath of the destruction, the injured Shuji gets a glimpse into the cloudy wreck; a sight of someone he never wanted to see in his own eyes.It was his girlfriend...who was the ultimate weapon, and Shuji is still in love with her.  (That's Right!  She's a walking WMD!)Like the name of episode 7, everyone's changing.  War was near, and the tragedy of the Sapporo Air Raid caused the people of Hokkaido to face different directions. Some enrolled to the army; some became too devastated to hope; some avoided the trauma.  For Shuji and Chise, they begged it was all a dream.  Their relationship took a turn for the worst.  The military keeps taking Chise as a trump card for the battlefield.  Meanwhile, a past came back to haunt Shuji, under a hot former teacher named Ms. Fuyumi, who seduced him when he was in middle school, and now she's back in need of ""support"" while her husband's at war, who's also ""supporting"" Chise.  Even worse, the more Chise's being used as a weapon, the more she becomes one, losing her sense of humanity.  The couple tried breaking up to ease their sorrow, but love can't break them apart.  They tried to move away from their homeland and pretend to be a couple after a downhearted series of events, but war eventually came and destroy their marital bliss.  With the war at its final stage and Chise's path to doom, the little planet plays its last love song when it all came down to its apocalyptical climax.By the end of series, I felt no happiness, no sorrow; I felt nothing.  Let me explain.""SAIKANO"" didn't clear up some things: ""How does this war happen?"", ""Is Chise suppose to be android or something?"", or ""Why is everyone apologizing and saying ""Dummy?"""" (Actually, that last one was rhetorical) I dislike how this anime didn't let me in on many details.  Even if the theme here is more focused on relationship, at least the anime should resolve some unexplained parts of the story.  That way, I would've understand the morbid experience from the events the characters suffer, which could've make me feel remorseful.  Not that it matters, since this anime tries to make up for that, by having the characters (mainly Chise) CRY THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE SERIES.  This anime has more sob moments than a 24-hour ""Beaches"" marathon, and with Chise, her weepy performance makes Tammy Faye act like The Terminator.  I wonder if a better title for this series would be, ""She, The Ultimate Crybaby.""  No offense, they're being exaggerated, not emotional, and it's annoying.For what it's worth, though, what ""SAIKANO"" does, it does very exceptionally, in the most violent and heartbreaking way.  What would do if you find out your lover is a weapon that can demolish a town in one shot?  It experiments the idea with Shuji and Chise, and that unique direction is very effective.  There are moments in this series that deserve to be mentioned and thought-provoking.  Like in episode 9 when Shuji was visiting a friend who was fatally-injured, and the friend was confessing everything and discussing about the past and the ""what ifs"", while another friend is at war just to protect a special girl from Hokkaido, only to realize there's nothing to protect but himself, leaving him in fear.  That came up as one of the most powerful scenes in anime history.  Granted that I wasn't devastated like the fans that saw that episode, but I should.It may be depressing, but ""SAIKANO"" pulls no stop for having typical anime comedy-fare, not to mention having some dark comedy as well.  I find the dubbing surprisingly pretty good.  At first, the cast sounds like cartoon rejects from Hanna-Barbera, but as the story progresses, they get better and they can pull off some heavy performances, even if some sounded wooden and one of them killed the pronunciation of manga with ""mahn-joh."" (MAHN-JOH!)The art bothers me in this anime.  WHY THE HECK IS EVERYONE BLUSHING?!  The character designs look like they were made for a Japanese PBS children show.  Not only that, it's baffling, considering Chise's stature; at times she looks young, but then at times she looks more adult, SHE CONFUSES ME!  Alright, so the designs were based on the original work, and I respect that, but the chunky look, following by the uninspiring drama music, takes away the seriousness of the premise and ends up being more of a sappy romantic soap opera.THE FINAL WORD: Sad.  It's sad not only that ""SAIKANO"" is depressing, it's also sad that when taken away the melancholy parts, I'm seeing a moderate anime with some half-finished plots and unappealing art.  However, I like the concept and despite the characters being too melodramatic, they act humanly enough to feel sorry for them, which helps understanding the anime's sentimentality.  There's certainly room for some improvement, but if ""SAIKANO"" has anime fans crying, it served its purpose.  If you looking for an anime romancer that's different and can make you shed a tear, by all means check this out. Results may vary, though, because I certainly find nothing to cry about here, and I wept from ""Ghost.""",3,SAI KANOt believe people find this remarkable,1101427200,"11 26,

Although Saikano is a war story, you don't even really see much action, it is mostly about the consequences and reactions of all different kinds of people.  One thing you must know before venturing on this title, it is not for the weak of heart, or perhaps, it is just right for the weak of heart.  If you enjoy letting out a good cry every once in a while, or if you can sit back and watch without getting emotional, watch it.

797100,A3F9VH8916IA40,B00019PDLQ,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[0, 1]","Review for whole series.I'm dumbstruck by all the raving reviews for this anime; I mean really people, did we all see the same show? I am so utterly confused as to why people consider a sub par anime like this and Elfen Lied: Diclonius Report Complete Collection to be great tragic animes which I've been told are guaranteed to make anyone with half a heart cry. I laugh in your faces. Siakano is nowhere near that good, and although it has its moments, overall it fails almost entirely to deliver on its promise to make me cry. Anyone with a halfway decent sized brain can penetrate the emotional fluff on the serface and see that this emperor isn't wearing any cloths at all, and is instead quite literally walking around naked everywhere. Almost everything is overdone and seems forced, from the plot, to the characters, to the bizarre ending which takes a page fromNeon Genesis Evangelion: Platinum Collectionplay book with horrendous results.Chise and Shuji are high school classmates in a small beach town somewhere in southern Japan. When the series starts they have just begun going out, but Shuji doesn't seem to care about the relationship while Chise becomes severely attached to him. Meanwhile Japan, for reasons unknown, is caught in the middle of a war with the United States and its allies (one can only assume it's the US, they never say but the ""enemy"" uses American style weapons) and is, obviously, losing ground. To counter the invasion of the American forces the Japanese military creates its ""ultimate weapon."" What is this ultimate weapon? Well it's Chise, the clumsy, small for her age high school girl from some random small town in southern Japan. Sound strange? Well don't expect an explanation about how and why she was chosen; those details apparently aren't of any importance to the story. This lack of an explanation is more then a little annoying though when the war takes center stage and grows in importance. By the end of the series nothing is left untouched by this devastating war, and yet we STILL don't know who the enemy is and why they are fighting. Was the war provoked by Japan or not? I want to know who to root for in the battles but how can I do that when I know nothing about the war?Don't make the mistake, however, of thinking Saikano is an action series, it most certainly is not. Although the war plays a pivotal role the series it focuses on our high school sweethearts Chise and Shuji. One day while walking down the streets of a major city a squadron of planes comes out of nowhere and starts dropping bombs on the unsuspecting people below. Shuji and his friends are caught in the crossfire until a streak of light shoots across the sky and destroys the planes. Chise. From that point on most of the story is about Shuji and Chise crying nonstop about how she's a super weapon and doesn't' want to be. It was sad during the first volume, but as the show progressed and the same scene kept repeating itself over and over and over again it got REALLY old REALLY fast. Chise would say she has to kill because she's a weapon, Shuji would call her a dummy, lights or bombs or something would come out of her back, she'd say she doesn't want to be a weapon, and then they hug, or sometimes he'd rip of her shirt. What a guy.There is also a comical absurdity to the whole love story. Shuji loves Chise but also loves his former teacher, whose name eludes me right now. Chise loves Shuji but loves a soldier named Tetsu on the side, who just happens to be married to the teacher that Shuji is banging back at home. Meanwhile Shuji's best friend, Akima, the one who introduced Chise and Shuji in the first place, is secretly in love with him, while Shuji's other best friend is in love with Akima, all the while Shuji is hopelessly oblivious to everything going on. Ha, how more soap operaish can you possibly get? Warning, warning, cheesy romantic overload, does not compute, brain ejecting from head.Spoilers ahead.But that's not even the worst of it. There is one instance when Tetsu is lying on the ground all shot up, his guts lying on the ground like hamburger meat, and Chise comforts him by, get this, putting his hand on her breasts. Yeah, almost dead Tetsu then climbs on top of her, no joke, spits up blood all over her face while calling his wife's name and then dies. I guess the healing powers of female cleavage doesn't always work (oh God I hope Amazon lets this review go up). Oh, but it gets even better my friend. Another scene stars Akima lying on her death bead after an earthquake destroys their town, finally telling Shuji that she loves him. Sounds sweet and heartbreaking, right? Well it would have been, had she not started talking about how much she'd always wanted to sleep with him. But it gets BETTER. Shuji, being the sensitive ready to please guy he is, then RIPS OFF HER SHIRT and straddles her. She's dieing, and he's ripping off her cloths. Man, I love this guy (that was sarcasm people). As you can see Shuji isn't the most likable guy in the world. He's totally oblivious, indecisive, somewhat of a pervert, and hits girls. Now the first three vices I can somewhat forgive (come on, all guys are perverts to a certain degree) but any guy who hits girls deserves to die. You hear that Shuji? I'm coming for you!So now I have to say something good, and despite all the fun I've been havening at this shows expense there is some good to report. It's not ALL bad, there are some genuine moments of tragedy that tugged at my heart strings quite a bit, as well as some characters who it seems to me should have been the main characters to begin with. Lets start with Akima, Shuji's best friend. She seems to me to be the only strong character in a show plagued by weak, indecisive wimps. She's a jock for one thing, a track star to be exact, but her personality is so charming and overbearing at the same time that I found myself loving her character every time she walked on screen. Along with her, the boy that falls in love with her, Shujis friend (no, I don't remember his name) is also a pretty good character who brings the war to life in a pretty real way midway through the series.The music ranges form magnificent to annoying. The opening song is sub par while the closer is a beautiful melody which is perfect in every way; but the background music is what I had issue with for the most part. Too many electric guitars when it should have been a violin, way too many hard strings when there should have been soft strings, stuff of that nature. Animation was also somewhat less then note worthy. Nothing flashy or really great, just average overall.So, if you want some REALLY depressing anime watch Kino's Journey, Now and Then, Here and There, or EVA, and give this one a pass. It isn't that great, not in the least bit, and you'll never get that time back.Replay value; low.",2,Was this suposed to be sad?,1212451200,"06 3, 2008",2008,6863,"['Review', 'whole', 'series.I',

797101,ASHS3J6EWUVUD,B00019PDLQ,K.M. Viglione,"[0, 0]","What initially brought this series to my attention was the visual image; in an anime magazine that had a brief blurb about the show showed one of the main characters, Chise, in mid-flight with her mechanical wings. When I read what it was about, I was intrigued.Chise and Shuji seem like typical dating high schoolers, but this all turned upside down when Japan goes to war, and Chise has become Japan's last line of defense. If the idea of modifying a human body to become a weapon creeps you out, it should. Chise is devoted to her duty, but is also afraid of the weapon within. Similarily, Shuji must also deal with this new side of his girlfriend.Both Chise and Shuji are very real, very human characters. As with any romance story, there are moments where you want to yell at the characters for doing something stupid that hurts the other. But when you stop and think about it, you realize that if you were their places, you'd react the same way. In this story, there isn't a lot of emphasis on the war, who is fight who and for what reason. War is the circumstance, and part of the main point of this story is how it affects the characters. (Which, as you can imagine, is a negative affect.)The relationship between Shuji and Chise could be very true life. In reality, no guy has to deal with his girlfriend turning into a weapon. But these two faces very real obstacles as their relationship evolves. They are good characters to identify with.While the opening theme to the show wasn't to my taste, the ending title, ""Sayonara"" is perfect for the show. Yuria Yato's vocals are tender and emotional, and the song is as equally heart-wrenching as the show itself.",5,Nothing more fitting than Sayonara,1142380800,"03 15, 2006",2006,1668,"['What', 'initially', 'brought', 'series', 'attention', 'was', 'visual', 'image', 'anime', 'magazine', 'had', 'brief', 'blurb', 'show', 'showed', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'Chise', 'mid-flight', 'mechanical', 'wings', 'When', 'read', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'intrigued.Chise', 'Shuji', 'seem', 'typical', 'dating', 'high', 'schoolers', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'Japan', 'war', 'Chise', 'become', 'Japan', 'last', 'line', 'defense', 'idea', 'modifying', 'human', 'body', 'become', 'weapon', 'creeps', 'should', 'Chise', 'devoted', 'duty', 'also', 'afraid', 'weapon', 'Similarily', 'Shuji', 'must', 'also', 'deal', 'new', 'side', 'girlfriend.Both', 'Chise', 'Shuji', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'human', 'characters', 'romance', 'story', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'want', 'yell', 'characters', 'doing', 'something', 'stupid', 'other', 'when', 'stop', 'think', 'realize', 'were', 'places', ""'d"", 'react', 'same', 'way', 'story', ""n't"", 'lot', 'emphasis', 'war', 'who', 'fight', 'who', 'what', 'reason', 'War', 'circumstance', 'part', 'main', 'point', 'story', 'how', 'characters', 'Which', 'can', 'imagine', 'negative', 'affect', 'relationship', 'Shuji', 'Chise', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'true', 'life', 'reality', 'guy', 'deal', 'girlfriend', 'turning', 'weapon', 'two', 'very', 'real', 'obstacles', 'relationship', 'evolves', 'are', 'good', 'characters', 'identify', 'opening', 'theme', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'taste', 'ending', 'title', 'Sayonara', 'perfect', 'show', 'Yuria', 'Yato', 'vocals', 'are', 'tender', 'emotional', 'song', 'equally', 'heart-wrenching', 'show']",Saikano: Girlfriend - Volume 1
797102,A2LS6A1XNO8Y7,B00019PDLQ,Nurse Washu,"[12, 13]","They say that all is fair in love and war, but when the two meet head on, that is the unfairest of them all. Like Grave of the Fireflies, Saikano is a war story presented with two dimensions. On one hand you have the harsh, grim reality of war, on the other the wistful idealism of love and romance. Shuuji and Chise are high school seniors, although Chise is quite short of stature and appears to be younger, like 12 or 13, but this lends itself well to her character's cuteness. Shuuji, is quite tall and very adult looking, so he seems much older than Chise and together they seem like an unlikely couple. Sort of setup by a mutual friend, they soon discover that they like each other and fall in love.However, Chise keeps hidden from everyone an awful secret about herself - that she also belongs to the military and can transform herself into a powerful weapon of mass destruction. In that form she is oddly similar to the Peacemakers in Scrapped Princess, but with far more versatility. At the end of the first episode Shuuji discovers this alternate reality of his kawaii little girlfriend, and then the struggle begins. It is a struggle for the two of them to love each other and for Shuuji and Chise to love themselves as individuals. It is a very powerful dramatic story, both Chise and Shuuji are very well developed characters, and I am particularly impressed with Shuuji. From my own experience, it's very rare to see the role of a male lover portrayed so beautifully in an anime series.When I finished watching Saikano it was one of those things that just made me step back and say - wow! It's not very often that I'll describe something as breathtaking, but that's the only word that I can find that's fit to describe this anime. In the end, the message is so simple, so perfect, and it so perfectly ties together all of the seemingly loose ends - the war, the unseen enemy, the nature of Chise herself, and Shuuji's love for her, all of it comes together in a perfect conclusion. While I was watching this series, my intuition told me that Saikano would have a painfully sorrowful ending. However, I didn't see it that way. In fact the message that I got from it was quite the opposite. I won't spoil it for anyone by revealing what that message is.Saikano is quite heavily emotional, and is definitely not light entertainment. But any person that understands their own feelings and has experienced real love in their own life will thoroughly enjoy this beautiful story. ^_^",5,This Beautiful Story,1084060800,"05 9, 2004",2004,2490,"['say', 'fair', 'love', 'war', 'when', 'two', 'meet', 'head', 'unfairest', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'Saikano', 'war', 'story', 'presented', 'two', 'dimensions', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'harsh', 'grim', 'reality', 'war', 'other', 'wistful', 'idealism', 'love', 'romance', 'Shuuji', 'Chise', 'are', 'high', 'school', 'seniors', 'Chise', 'quite', 'short', 'stature', 'be', 'younger', '12', '13', 'well', 'character', 'cuteness', 'Shuuji', 'quite', 'tall', 'very', 'adult', 'looking', 'much', 'older', 'Chise', 'together', 'seem', 'unlikely', 'couple', 'Sort', 'setup', 'mutual', 'friend', 'soon', 'discover', 'like', 'other', 'fall', 'love.However', 'Chise', 'hidden', 'everyone', 'awful', 'secret', 'also', 'military', 'can', 'transform', 'powerful', 'weapon', 'mass', 'destruction', 'form', 'oddly', 'similar', 'Peacemakers', 'Scrapped', 'Princess', 'far', 'more', 'versatility', 'end', 'first', 'episode', 'Shuuji', 'alternate', 'reality', 'kawaii', 'little', 'girlfriend', 'then', 'struggle', 'struggle', 'two', 'love', 'other', 'Shuuji', 'Chise', 'love', 'individuals', 'very', 'powerful', 'dramatic', 'story', 'Chise', 'Shuuji', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'developed', 'characters', 'am', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'Shuuji', 'own', 'experience', 'very', 'rare', 'see', 'role', 'male', 'lover', 'portrayed', 'so', 'beautifully', 'anime', 'series.When', 'finished', 'watching', 'Saikano', 'was', 'one', 'things', 'just', 'made', 'step', 'back', 'say', 'wow', 'not', 'very', 'often', ""'ll"", 'describe', 'something', 'breathtaking', 'only', 'word', 'can', 'find', 'fit', 'describe', 'anime', 'end', 'message', 'so', 'simple', 'so', 'perfect', 'so', 'perfectly', 'together', 'seemingly', 'loose', 'ends', 'war', 'unseen', 'enemy', 'nature', 'Chise', 'Shuuji', 'love', 'together', 'perfect', 'conclusion', 'was', 'watching', 'series', 'intuition', 'told', 'Saikano', 'would', 'have', 'painfully', 'sorrowful', 'ending', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'way', 'fact', 'message', 'got', 'was', 'quite', 'opposite', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anyone', 'revealing', 'what', 'message', 'is.Saikano', 'quite', 'heavily', 'emotional', 'definitely', 'not', 'light', 'entertainment', 'person', 'own', 'feelings', 'experienced', 'real', 'love', 'own', 'life', 'will', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'beautiful', 'story', '^_^']",Saikano: Girlfriend - Volume 1

I know, that's a lot to take in, but that's exactly what happens when Shuji, a Japanese student, finds Chise, his girlfriend, after an air raid with metal wings sticking out of her back, and a nasty looking chain cannon for an arm. Of course, she can mold her form back to where she looks her normal clumsy self, but in times of danger she can become a killing machine. She's doing a good job, but as time progresses it seems she's becoming more weapon than human. Will their love be able to survive and will Chise even know what love is if she loses her humanity?Saikano is really a unique series in that it takes a far-flung sci-fi concept and mixes it with realism and romance. If your girlfriend really was an ""Ultimate Weapon"", in real life Saikano is probably how your realtionship would progress, that is, if you didn't run away in a panic at the first get-go. There was a little too much crying and sentimentality in this first volume for me, but after all, it is a sad story, so I can forgive it. There is some humor in it, especially in the scenes at school, where Chise tries to keep up appearances. And I really liked the two main characters. They seemed genuine. I like the fact that we don't really know the cause of the war or who we are fighting. It just underlines the insanity of combat. Great show.The second DVD contains a lot of extras which include interviews with the Japanese VAs that play Shuji and Chise, a Making of feature, and a series of short promotional videos hosted by a way too perky young lady who has to make very exaggerated hand motions as she gives you more info about Saikano.
