In fact if someone other than Whoopi Goldberg was the Banshee, I think it would have been great. Now let me state up front I love Whoopi Goldeberg. She was great in Star Trek series, and I love all her comedy movies. I own most of them. However, putting her in as the Banshee in this movie is like putting a Irishman in as a globetrotter in a movie about the Harlem Globetrotters. It doesn't fit, so please stop doing it whoever is responsible for this kind of off culture/race casting. It reminded me how they cast Will Smith as James West for ""Wild, Wild, West"". Next I suppose they will cast William Macy as ""Shaft"". I don't like racism, and I certainly don't like casting white or blacks in movies that aren't appropriate to the culture or the theme of the movie.

It has brief moments of charm, too much irish spirit, which again children won't understand, and relys too much upon it's effects. None of it makes logical sense, granted it is a fairytale, but even still nothing is explained. There are too many characters, and the Romeo and Juliette story completely complicates everything to such a disaster that a war breaks out and nothing is accomplished.

The romantic remake of romeo &amp; juliet with fairies and leprechauns was done very well in my opinion. The only out of place character however would be the banshie ,who should have been called something different since her role doesn't at all fit the description. Since a Banshie is normally a tormented soul with a wailing cry i'd say woopie goldberg's character was far too easy going. There were a few other plotlines that were a bit mismatched with old folklores, other than that the movie is worth a try for any fairy tale lover or romantic.",3,An enjoyable fairytale,1065571200,"10 8, 2003",2003,729,"['misplaced', 'legends', 'folklores', 'movie', 'storyline', 'thought', 'film', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'own.Overall', 'was', 'enchanting', 'tale', 'kids', 'adore', 'romantic', 'remake', 'romeo', 'amp', 'juliet', 'fairies', 'leprechauns', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'opinion', 'only', 'place', 'character', 'however', 'would', 'be', 'banshie', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'something', 'different', 'role', ""n't"", 'fit', 'description', 'Banshie', 'normally', 'tormented', 'soul', 'wailing', 'cry', 'i', ""'d"", 'say', 'woopie', 'goldberg', 'character', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'easy', 'going', 'were', 'few', 'other', 'plotlines', 'were', 'bit', 'mismatched', 'old', 'folklores', 'other', 'movie', 'try', 'fairy', 'tale', 'lover', 'romantic']",N/A
475296,A4FX5YCJA630V,6305742014,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[8, 10]","To start with I'll list the bad points, just to get them over and done with. The movie really has three story plots - one dealing with humans and one dealing with the fairies, and the last a mix of both that deals with the consequences of the war that ensues between the fairies and the leprechauns. You can never quite tell which one is meant to be the main focus of the movie, which makes it feel not quite stable. You would expect the fairies and leprechauns to be the main protaginists because of the title of the movie, but it really begins and ends with the humans. In saying that, this human story centres around Jack Green (Randy Quaid) who has come to Ireland on behalf of a building development company to see what the place has to offer. He falls in love with the lovely Kathleen Fitzpatrick (Orla Bradly) who is none to pleased to discover his true intentions for being in her beloved country. This half of the story is too grown-up for kids and too predictable and over-used for adults to be very interesting, and unfortunatly it tends to overshadow the far more interesting fairy-tale, which is as wonderful a fairy tale as you could wish to see.The regal blonde-haired, blue-eyed, Trooping Fairies and the mischevious and fun-loving red-haired, green-eyed Kerry Leprechauns have never been friends, but for years have maintained an uneasy peace for the sake of Ireland's natural world, which they both help maintain. However, following a Romeo-and-Juliet storyline, the son of the leprechaun chief Mickey Muldoon (the adorable Daniel Bretts) and his friends sneak into the fairies' castle during their Midsummer Ball and promptly falls in love with the King and Queen's only daughter, the beautiful Princess Jessica (the equally enchanting Caroline Carver). Other parallels to Shakespeare's play are evident in Mickey's best friend Sean Devine, who is killed by Jessica's jealous cousin Count Grogan, and the two lovers flee captivity, leaving the mounting war between the fairies and leprechauns behind them.It is this fairytale story line that far surpasses that of the human story, and makes the movie worth watching. The sweetness and charm of both Mickey and Jessica is wonderful to watch as they grapple with the guilt over the war they have caused and their reluctance to return to their homes and thus face separation. Their entire journey, from their meeting at the fairy ball, Jessica's seclusion in the underwater city, their travels through the swamp and the climb up Moonstone Mountain are accompanied by flawless special effects, lovely scenery and set designs and beautiful costumes, making it a classic fairytale.The last story is of course this war that the two lovers inadvertantly cause, and starts when a surprised Jack rescues the chief of the leprechauns Seamus Muldoon (who else but Colm Meaney) from drowning. He vows to put an end to the war that is destroying Ireland and with Kathleen, Mickey and Jessica they seek the help of the Grand Banshee (Whoopi Goldberg). Never mind the rather strange fact that the leader of the Irish fairies and leprechauns is African-American, because Whoopi has great sarcasm and comic timing.Lastly I'd like to mention the parents of both Jessica and Mickey, who provide most of the laughs for this movie - King Boric (Roger Daltrey) and Queen Morag (Harriet Walter) of the Fairies, and Seamus and Mary Muldoon (Zoe Wanamaker) for the leprechauns, who bicker in all directions - husband against wife, wife against the other wife, and husband against the other husband.Two out of these three plots are a joy to watch and even my father who usually runs screaming from these types of movies warmed up to it and chuckled more than once. See this movie, as the true fairy-tale of adventure and romance is perfect.",5,A Perfect Fairytale,1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,3782,"['start', ""'ll"", 'list', 'bad', 'points', 'just', 'get', 'over', 'done', 'movie', 'really', 'three', 'story', 'plots', 'one', 'dealing', 'humans', 'one', 'dealing', 'fairies', 'last', 'mix', 'consequences', 'war', 'fairies', 'leprechauns', 'can', 'never', 'quite', 'tell', 'one', 'meant', 'be', 'main', 'focus', 'movie', 'feel', 'not', 'quite', 'stable', 'would', 'expect', 'fairies', 'leprechauns', 'be', 'main', 'protaginists', 'title', 'movie', 'really', 'humans', 'saying', 'human', 'story', 'centres', 'Jack', 'Green', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'who', 'come', 'Ireland', 'behalf', 'building', 'development', 'company', 'see', 'what', 'place', 'offer', 'love', 'lovely', 'Kathleen', 'Fitzpatrick', 'Orla', 'Bradly', 'who', 'none', 'pleased', 'discover', 'true', 'intentions', 'being', 'beloved', 'country', 'half', 'story', 'too', 'grown-up', 'kids', 'too', 'predictable', 'over-used', 'adults', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'unfortunatly', 'overshadow', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'fairy-tale', 'wonderful', 'fairy', 'tale', 'could', 'wish', 'see.The', 'regal', 'blonde-haired', 'blue-eyed', 'Trooping', 'Fairies', 'mischevious', 'fun-loving', 'red-haired', 'green-eyed', 'Kerry', 'Leprechauns', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'friends', 'years', 'have', 'maintained', 'uneasy', 'peace', 'sake', 'Ireland', 'natural', 'world', 'help', 'maintain', 'However', 'following', 'Romeo-and-Juliet', 'storyline', 'son', 'leprechaun', 'chief', 'Mickey', 'Muldoon', 'adorable', 'Daniel', 'Bretts', 'friends', 'sneak', 'fairies', 'castle', 'Midsummer', 'Ball', 'promptly', 'love', 'King', 'Queen', 'only', 'daughter', 'beautiful', 'Princess', 'Jessica', 'equally', 'enchanting', 'Caroline', 'Carver', 'Other', 'parallels', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'are', 'evident', 'Mickey', 'best', 'friend', 'Sean', 'Devine', 'who', 'killed', 'Jessica', 'jealous', 'cousin', 'Count', 'Grogan', 'two', 'lovers', 'flee', 'captivity', 'leaving', 'mounting', 'war', 'fairies', 'leprechauns', 'them.It', 'fairytale', 'story', 'line', 'far', 'human', 'story', 'movie', 'watching', 'sweetness', 'charm', 'Mickey', 'Jessica', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'grapple', 'guilt', 'war', 'have', 'caused', 'reluctance', 'return', 'homes', 'thus', 'face', 'separation', 'entire', 'journey', 'meeting', 'fairy', 'ball', 'Jessica', 'seclusion', 'underwater', 'city', 'travels', 'swamp', 'climb', 'up', 'Moonstone', 'Mountain', 'are', 'accompanied', 'flawless', 'special', 'effects', 'lovely', 'scenery', 'set', 'designs', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'making', 'classic', 'fairytale.The', 'last', 'story', 'course', 'war', 'two', 'lovers', 'inadvertantly', 'cause', 'when', 'surprised', 'Jack', 'chief', 'leprechauns', 'Seamus', 'Muldoon', 'who', 'else', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'drowning', 'put', 'end', 'war', 'destroying', 'Ireland', 'Kathleen', 'Mickey', 'Jessica', 'seek', 'help', 'Grand', 'Banshee', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'mind', 'rather', 'strange', 'fact', 'leader', 'Irish', 'fairies', 'leprechauns', 'African-American', 'Whoopi', 'great', 'sarcasm', 'comic', 'timing.Lastly', ""'d"", 'like', 'mention', 'parents', 'Jessica', 'Mickey', 'who', 'provide', 'most', 'laughs', 'movie', 'King', 'Boric', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'Queen', 'Morag', 'Harriet', 'Walter', 'Fairies', 'Seamus', 'Mary', 'Muldoon', 'Zoe', 'Wanamaker', 'leprechauns', 'who', 'bicker', 'directions', 'husband', 'wife', 'wife', 'other', 'wife', 'husband', 'other', 'husband.Two', 'three', 'plots', 'are', 'joy', 'watch', 'even', 'father', 'who', 'usually', 'screaming', 'types', 'movies', 'warmed', 'up', 'chuckled', 'more', 'once', 'See', 'movie', 'true', 'fairy-tale', 'adventure', 'romance', 'perfect']",N/A
