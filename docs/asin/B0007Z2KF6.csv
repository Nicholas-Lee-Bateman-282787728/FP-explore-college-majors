There was something magical & I ""got"" it, even back then-as I think other fans of this show have. Perhaps, that why I desperately waited for the DVD's to come out. As I watched the episodes, one realizes what a high caliber show this was and is. Can you name anything that has as wonderful a combination of comedy, drama, spirituality, and strong characters as this on tv right now? The DVD's are crisp and clear catching Northern Exposure's gorgeous scenery with its wintery landscapes and fresh autumns. It's nice to revisit the general store/post office Ruth Anne ran to the Brick-practically the hubbub of the town. I almost felt like throwing on a parka and heading to Alaska from the images the scenes invoke.Much has been mentioned about the music. Sometimes I did notice that there seems to be more silent spots where I thought music should be playing. It wasn't until I watched #9 Get Real that the music totally clashed (hard hitting pianos and crazy guitar chords straight out of a low budget soap opera) with  the scene of the silent Flying Man performing for Marilyn. Even then this episode with carnival performers is wonderful. My favorite is the Emmy-winning Seoul Mates episode, a ""Christmas"" in Cicely is awesome indeed. Another favorite is ""The Body in Question"" about the french man frozen from 2 centuries ago is absolutely hilarious.I guess I could get upset over the stupid credits of Topher Grace's movie (cant even remeber the name of it) that I can't fast foward through, or the dismal packaging, or the music but I am so desperate to view these gems I'll go ahead and take it- all 23 episodes that are worth their weight in gold.",5,"Artistic Masterpieces, Better than anything on TV now",1120089600,"06 30, 2005",2005,1717,"['was', '9', 'years', 'old', 'back', 'when', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'began', '1990', 'was', 'something', 'magical', 'got', 'even', 'back', 'then-as', 'think', 'other', 'fans', 'show', 'have', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'desperately', 'waited', 'DVD', 'come', 'out', 'watched', 'episodes', 'one', 'what', 'high', 'caliber', 'show', 'was', 'Can', 'name', 'anything', 'as', 'wonderful', 'combination', 'comedy', 'drama', 'spirituality', 'strong', 'characters', 'tv', 'right', 'now', 'DVD', 'are', 'crisp', 'clear', 'catching', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'wintery', 'landscapes', 'fresh', 'autumns', 'nice', 'revisit', 'general', 'store/post', 'office', 'Ruth', 'Anne', 'ran', 'Brick-practically', 'hubbub', 'town', 'almost', 'felt', 'throwing', 'parka', 'heading', 'Alaska', 'images', 'scenes', 'been', 'mentioned', 'music', 'Sometimes', 'did', 'notice', 'there', 'be', 'more', 'silent', 'spots', 'where', 'thought', 'music', 'should', 'be', 'playing', 'was', ""n't"", 'watched', '9', 'Get', 'Real', 'music', 'totally', 'clashed', 'hard', 'hitting', 'pianos', 'crazy', 'guitar', 'chords', 'straight', 'low', 'budget', 'soap', 'opera', 'scene', 'silent', 'Flying', 'Man', 'performing', 'Marilyn', 'Even', 'then', 'episode', 'carnival', 'performers', 'wonderful', 'favorite', 'Emmy-winning', 'Seoul', 'Mates', 'episode', 'Christmas', 'Cicely', 'awesome', 'indeed', 'favorite', 'Body', 'Question', 'french', 'man', 'frozen', '2', 'centuries', 'ago', 'absolutely', 'hilarious.I', 'guess', 'could', 'get', 'upset', 'stupid', 'credits', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'movie', 'cant', 'even', 'remeber', 'name', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fast', 'foward', 'dismal', 'packaging', 'music', 'am', 'so', 'desperate', 'view', 'gems', ""'ll"", 'go', 'ahead', 'take', 'it-', '23', 'episodes', 'are', 'worth', 'weight', 'gold']",Northern Exposure: The Complete Third Season

Northern Exposure is pure, marvelous delight and I am so glad that we have the opportunity to buy DVDs so we can see it again.

I was gutted when watching the second season of this series on DVD only to realise that it was full of pappy generic music where REAL music should have been.

While it is great that this stunning series is finally being released on DVD, I can't help but feel that, without all the fabulous music,  it is somewhat the poorer. So many memorable and moving scenes are made all the more so by the perfectly-chosen music that accompanies them, so it is sad to think that we are being made to choose between a compromised DVD version of NE on one hand, or no NE at all apart from the old videotapes and reruns on the other.

That's really the whole focal point for their little barbs.. here its hardly existent in most episodes and then made issue in some. Kinda throws me off. Adam and Sgt. Semanski are the best part of this season and they have little screen time in the season. Both are great characters and wish they had been a bigger part. And lastly, the writing seems to be more cute and preachy. ""Cicely"" for example. Even Chris' relativist, Eastern philosophy ramblings take on an annoying tone.  The 2nd season had more witty banter and more random events making this show what its known for. Here its replaced with too much sentiment and less hilarity. I can appreciate giving the show some heart but its slightly too obvious on the sleeve here. Like when Joel discovers that Jack, the previous resident committed suicide, they never really fully tie it all together in a Norther Exposure kind of way. That episode had some really great opportunities to explore but doesn't. Its sentimental but not really well connected themes. Then there's ""Burning Down the House"" which is classic Northern Exposure. Best episode of the season. This season just seems a bit lost for identity.. or maybe trying to assume too many.

My series three came in its green slipboard case with no labelling of 'Northern exposure series 3' on the spine of the case. What is the idea of a blank spine so that when you are searching your shelves for something you have to pull the item out completely to see what it is?Can't we have a label on the spine too please. We seem to have gone from one extreme to another - from cute parka overkill to almost blank case. Was this an expression of frustration from packaging designers who feel they did well with the parkas and werent appreciated for it? I didnt mind the parkas but it would have been good to stay with the concept for uniformity once they'd started - or at least visually emulate a parka printed on the casing.It may also seem picky to focus on packaging but it is part of the product (and a fairly high priced one) you are buying that is there to add to the products accessibility, usefulness and visual appeal. So I hope they lift their game next time.I loved the music of Northern Exposure for its eclectic suitability. I'm not as tuned into what music was originally in each section. However the music was such a key element in the shows presentation and added to its quirky feel - why mess with something so integral? The series was so good that it may seem petty to comment on these things but music can be very important to mood and is a key artistic element that a lot of thought was put into in the original.Northern Exposure fans though are there for the DVD contents and will no doubt put up with the irritations but I hope the consumers' needs will be kept more in mind in future.",4,great series delivered less than ideally,1119312000,"06 21, 2005",2005,1643,"[""'m"", 'adding', 'packaging', 'comments', 'series', 'three', 'came', 'green', 'slipboard', 'case', 'labelling', ""'Northern"", 'exposure', 'series', '3', 'spine', 'case', 'What', 'idea', 'blank', 'spine', 'when', 'are', 'searching', 'shelves', 'something', 'have', 'pull', 'item', 'out', 'completely', 'see', 'what', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'label', 'spine', 'too', 'please', 'seem', 'have', 'gone', 'one', 'extreme', 'cute', 'parka', 'overkill', 'almost', 'blank', 'case', 'Was', 'expression', 'frustration', 'packaging', 'designers', 'who', 'feel', 'did', 'well', 'parkas', 'werent', 'appreciated', 'didnt', 'parkas', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'stay', 'concept', 'uniformity', 'once', ""'d"", 'started', 'least', 'visually', 'emulate', 'parka', 'printed', 'casing.It', 'may', 'also', 'seem', 'picky', 'focus', 'packaging', 'part', 'product', 'fairly', 'high', 'priced', 'one', 'are', 'buying', 'there', 'add', 'products', 'accessibility', 'usefulness', 'visual', 'appeal', 'hope', 'lift', 'game', 'time.I', 'loved', 'music', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'eclectic', 'suitability', ""'m"", 'not', 'as', 'tuned', 'what', 'music', 'was', 'originally', 'section', 'However', 'music', 'was', 'such', 'key', 'element', 'shows', 'presentation', 'added', 'quirky', 'feel', 'why', 'mess', 'something', 'so', 'integral', 'series', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'may', 'seem', 'petty', 'comment', 'things', 'music', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'important', 'mood', 'key', 'artistic', 'element', 'lot', 'thought', 'was', 'put', 'original.Northern', 'Exposure', 'fans', 'are', 'DVD', 'contents', 'will', 'doubt', 'put', 'up', 'irritations', 'hope', 'consumers', 'needs', 'will', 'be', 'kept', 'more', 'mind', 'future']",Northern Exposure: The Complete Third Season

I'm an arch-capitalist who is fully aware that businesses exist for the purpose of turning a profit. HOWEVER, there's a matter of integrity involved, both economic and artistic.A number of NE fans, presumably younger ones, seem to have overlooked a basic point. Brand & Falsey, the creators of NE, are Baby Boomers; in fact, I think they're probably my age. We grew up glued to Top 40 radio which, through the mid-50's and beyond, played just about any type of music that DJ's thought listeners would enjoy (and would sell)--pop, rock, easy listening, country, R&B;, novelties, saga songs, movie themes--you name it, it probably got played. That music helped to form our tastes as we got older; it prepared us to be receptive to virtually all music, including the new wave that hit in the mid-70's and which sometimes appears in NE, e.g., Robert Palmer. In fact, that music helped form us as people; THIS is why the music is such an integral part of NE and why the particular pieces used were chosen: Brand & Falsey are products of their time and culture and they're paying tribute to it. In fact, I don't believe that younger audiences can even fully appreciate the series because they're not familiar with the music. Would Rick's funeral procession be as funny if ""Nature Boy"" weren't being played as ironic background music? How many younger viewers recognize ""Theme from Moulin Rouge"" when Shelly tries to emulate a 50's housewife? THIS is the ""seasoning"" that contributes to the flavor of an already funny show and raises its level to the sublime.To put it bluntly: the music is itself a character in the series.And how successful, may I ask, is the rerelease of a series in which a character's participation is edited? And how ethical is a business concern that gives no warning of any kind on the packaging of that release to the effect that one of the characters is missing? I thought we were supposed to have progressed past the days of ""caveat emptor.""Universal has a pretty crummy track record, from where I sit, where doing right by their customer base is concerned. And pray answer, previous reviewer, why, if the rights to the music were not available, said music appears in its entirety...on the SPANISH LANGUAGE TRACK?! I suspect I'm not unique in wanting an explanation to that one. And why are purchasers asked to shell out big bucks on the basis of ""securing the rights"" for music that's not included, not to mention even crummier packaging than on the previous releases? (Yeah, I know it's cheaper on Amazon, but that's only because it's not selling well.)Fans are entitled to opine that the omission of the music is trivial. However, to postulate that the disappointment of those of us with higher standards and who know better is unreasonable is just outrageous, particularly in view of the fact that we just want the series the way it was released--in its entirety. Universal ought to be ashamed.My only hope is that they don't get their mitts on St. Elsewhere.Note to a succedent reviewer: Perhaps it escaped your attention that ""appreciate"" was qualified by the adverb ""fully"" in my review. People are not only entitled to their own opinions, they appreciate things on different levels, e.g., I'm aware that I cannot ""fully"" appreciate Tarkovsky because I don't speak Russian; nevertheless, I'm a fan. Regardless, I want to view his work as he intended it, which is why I'm unhappy with Kino's release of ""Mirror."" I read Amazon reviews because I want to know what I don't know. And if, as you write, younger viewers are to ""appreciate"" NE, wouldn't they have a better shot at doing so ""fully"" if the series were presented as intended and originally released or at least being aware that they're getting an altered release? My complaint was with those who think that people like myself have no basis for disappointment; if you're happy with the status quo, that's fine for you. But on what grounds do you base your claim that ""the vast majority of viewers,"" etc., won't notice the omission (a speculative stretch, to say the least)? Certainly not on the fact that Amazon has the series ""priced to move,"" as it were, not to mention the reviews expressing disappointment, not to also mention that the people for whom the series was targeted have been programmed by years of Top 40 Radio listening to associate songs with events--""scenes"" in this case. With all due respect, you're way off base.Refer back to my ""Spanish language track"" observation (for which no one has yet offered an explanation), and as for the disclaimer that FINALLY appears on the package, well, better late than never, I guess--it doesn't change the fact that it would seem that their prior omission was misleading and based on thinking like yours, i.e., that the ""vast majority"" of purchasers ""wouldn't notice"" and that ""...business and artistic intergrity are pretty much [...] mutually exclusive.""I stand by my review; its basis isn't speculative. I've personally had bad experiences with Universal's DVD releases; I've never even had the courtesy of an acknowledgement of my ever-so-correct correspondence with regard to defective merchandise (and no, unless Universal is also producing movies involving women and donkeys or have expanded their manufacturing base to include ""prescription meds,"" no reply was inadvertantly overlooked in my spam folder).I should've guessed that my mess of a Monster Legacy Box Set and the commercials that couldn't be skipped on the most recent release of Animal House (just like TV but more expensive!) were harbingers of more bad things to come.

Same applies here; if studios are going to sell edited versions (in this case and in the case of ""ILC, S3,"" loss of original music) of the series we remember, then they need to state so on the product listing.  Otherwise, let's stop buying the DVDs.  Frankly, I'm sick of the entertainment industry with all its complaints of piracy - what did they do to us selling us an ""incomplete"" product?  It's okay for them to do so, while at the same time they sue some person who is legitimately backing up his/her CDs...?  Let's get Amazon.com to weild its clout and force either a) the original series, or b) some disclaimer on the boxes.  In either case, let the market decide - let's see if customers will pay a higher price for the ""real series."" Or will fully-informed customers cause the sales to tank?  Either way, it's better than getting ripped off like we are now.  For ""Northern Exposure,"" like ""Tour of Duty,"" ""In Living Color,"" or ""thirtysomething"" (if it ever shows up on DVD, the music was the series!Second, the packaging.

We love this series: it is intelligent, entertaining, at times even spiritually enlightening. The characters are engaging and complex. I don't know what more anybody could ask for...what are the odds that anything like this could ever make it into prime time? The odds approach infinity. I can't even think of that many movies that have the same level of intelligence.Personally I am convinced that Universal is doing its best to safeguard the integrity of the original episodes and transfer this to DVD in 99.9% of its entirety, unless legally impossible. I am inclined to trust the person who was professionally involved in licensing (see his review) rather than the many who are not. If you are one of the ones griping about the music, I simply see no evidence that the integrity of Northern Exposure has been damaged in any significant way on Season 1 or 2. You are not only punishing yourself, but punishing others as well. Those who truly love this series are going to vote with their pocketbooks. And the result will be that Universal will keep releasing the series on DVD. I am truly grateful that Season 3 is coming out and hope the entire series makes it to DVD.The only legitimate gripe that Universal needs to hear is: skip the damn Parka packaging and use the money for labels. Cripes, blank DVDs in volume is not that expensive and I'd be more than happy to cover the difference.

896269,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B0007Z2KF6,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","The pros when it comes to season 3 (and beyond) are that the double sided DVDs are gone, and you get full seasons of the show.  Season 3 has 23 episodes vs the 8 and 7 for the first two seasons.  The con is, of course, some (but not all) of the original music from the series is gone and replaced with canned instrumental music.  Some of the original songs are still there.  Most of the replacement music are in Chris' scenes in the radio station.  I do not have the old episodes on tape and do not remember the original songs off the top of my head (I was a teenager when the show aired, and did not pay a ton of attention to the music) so I am not sure what the original songs were, but you can tell when a replacement was dropped in.Obviously a main sticking point when it comes to releasing old shows on DVD is getting the rights to the music.  NE is certainly not the only show it has happened to, but it was a show where music was a large part of the show and not always just on in the background.  The reality is that Universal could not just release the DVDs with original music without getting permission from all the rights holders to all the songs.  If they did they would be sued.  The big controversy when the first couple seasons got released on DVD was the high cost (especially since there were so few episodes) because they paid for the rights to all the songs and passed it on to the consumer.  Now yes, you can be mad that they were too cheap to continue to pay whatever it takes to get all the songs, but these days the only way to see the show is in this format.  It is not on in syndication any longer, so unless you taped it on VHS years ago, there would be no way to see it.  So you have to make the choice about whether or not having all the music will ruin your enjoyment of the show to an extent that you could never watch it any other way.The third season begins to abandon Joel's ""fish out of water"" feeling, and starts to focus on more of the ancillary characters and the town itself.  It also expands on the sexual tension and ""will they/wont they"" aspect to the Joel and Maggie relationship.  Toward the end of the season you started to see less of Rob Morrow because he was starting to have contract issues with the producers.  As a result many of the episodes began what would continue into the remaining seasons of focusing on other story lines.  The show had very high quality acting and writing however, so even though they began reducing his role the show remained entertaining.As far as extras go, there are deleted and/or extended scenes for every episode on each disc.  The last disc has a few different gag reels and some unaired storylines.  There are no commentaries or interviews with cast members at all, but for what is there, the material is good.  The A/V quality is about what you would expect for a DVD presentation of a show that is now over 20 years old.  Not great, but better than what you would get on VHS. If you can accept not having all the music, it is definitely worth picking up because the show is wonderful, and this is probably the best overall season.

Some music is missing, yes, but, guess what?  The show still rocks.  The music was wonderful, but the episode ending music all seems to be intact as far as I can tell.  Specifically I am thinking of the wonderful song that accompanies the end of the Running of the Bulls episode.  Man, that song and that scene cemented NE as THE SHOW at the time for me.So, yeah, some music is missing, and, yeah, I'm bummed about that.  But the show is so damn amazing that I would definitely rather have it sans some music than not have it at all.  Why punish myself by not getting to see it again?  Because that is who I would be punishing.  Universal will get along just fine without my 30-40 bucks, and yours, too.  You aren't punishing them by not watching these shows.  You are only punishing yourself.And while watching the episodes, never once did I think to myself, ""Hey, where's that song?""  Not once.  The shows are just too good to obsess over some missing mystery music.  Would they be better?  Yeah.  Are they still great anyway?  Hell yeah.  I'd rather have NE with a few missing songs than a 20 disc exhaustive set of some overrated show that I could care less about.  X-Files perhaps?On top of that, the sheer tonnage of deleted scenes and unexposed footage is a true treasure.  A lot of what ended up cut for time purposes is every bit as good as what made it into the episodes, especially as the show progressed.  Getting to see so much new material was a real treat.So why only 4 stars?  I want more.  I want some commentaries, and I want some making of/retrospective material.  That stuff, more than the missing music, is what bumps it down to a 4 star release for me.

Afterall, Season 1 only had 8 episodes, season 2 was down to 7 episodes. We may have been hardpressed to be willing to shell out the $40-50 for the price tags on each of those seasons when they should honestly have been released in unison in one set of Season 1 & 2 package giving us 15 episodes for the one price. Finally we have our first full season of NEx with 20some episodes. This is the proper satisfaction of acceptable material/episodes for the pricing.Rather than go on about how great NEx was, let's look at the actual product here. Before, you got the cute but quaint little parka with your season package. Now we have the standard cardboard box holder. At least it will stand up on your shelf properly and your kid's Barbie doesn't get another sleeping bag (ie the parka package). The quality of the show is transferred well and the images are just as good as the original airings. The sound is well done through the majority of the episodes (one of them had music vs speech balance screwed up).No the downer of the set. Upon reading some reviews with their rantings about being upset that original series music wasn't included, I would laugh at their pettiness. The thing is, in some small part they were right. There is a definite lack when watching the episodes and you can hear the bland, generic, soft sounds, and instrumental mish mash with which Universal replaced the original scores. You can however, overlook (overlisten?) the majority of the music filler but there are certain points in certain shows where you think, ""What the heck?!""; prominently is the quirky music that Chris in the Morning played during his segments.

896273,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0007Z2KF6,Robert Moore,"[10, 13]","Season Three, which began in the fall of 1991, was the first full season of NORTHERN EXPOSURE after two very short seasons that appeared in the summer of 1990 and the spring of 1991.  The first two seasons, though brief, were tantalizing for their uniqueness and quality.  Season One lacked many of the fantasy and surreal elements that was such an important part of the subsequent seasons, but from Season Two until the final season when the show began to suffer following the loss of Rob Morrow, the show was amazingly consistent.  Until THE X-FILES debuted in the fall of 1993, NORTHERN EXPOSURE was far and away the quirkiest, most delightful television show on network television.  Even the staid Emmys, which usually reserves its award for less innovative, interesting series, acknowledged the brilliance of the show by recognizing Season Three by awarding it the Emmy for Best Drama.Though the first two seasons did not lack for great individual episodes, Season Three hit the ground running and turned out one classic episode after another.  Beginning with ""The Bumpy Road to Love,"" in which Maggie learns of her dead lover Rick's many infidelities and Joel and kidnapped by Adam's lover Eve until the season finale ""Cicely,"" which tells of the town's founding by two progressive lesbians, viewers were given one imaginative treat after another.  Choosing favorites in such a rich season is almost silly, but I do have favorites.  I loved ""Oy Wilderness,"" in which Maggie and Joel have engine problems while flying back to Cicely and are forced to spend a couple of days in the wilderness.  Even better was ""Animals R Us,"" where Maggie becomes convinced that a stray dog is actually Rick reincarnated.  One of Joel's best episodes comes in ""A-Hunting We Will Go,"" where the nonhunting New Yorker gains a sudden passion for hunting that can only be described as bloodlust, only to suffer a change of heart when he can't stand to kill the grouse he has shot, instead binding its wounds and nursing it back to health.  A circus comes to Cicely in ""Get Real,"" with the performers portrayed by members of Cirque du Soleil and Marilyn engages in a courtship in which words play only a small role.  ""Burning Down the House"" is memorable for a visit from Maggie's mother, who inadvertently burns down her house, and for Chris's attempt to find just the right cow to throw through the air on his trebuchet, deciding to toss a piano instead once Ed informs him that Monty Python had performed the same stunt in a movie.  ""Democracy in America"" is precious if for no other reason than to see the previously hirsute Chris show up at the polling site resplendent with a fresh shave, haircut, and conservative black suit and tie.  The pride with which he, a convicted felon unable to vote, gazes upon all those able to exercise their right to vote is for me one of the highpoints of the season.  In a season filled with amazing episodes, my favorite might have been ""It Happened in Juneau.""  Forced to share a room because of a lack of hotel rooms, Joel and Maggie decide to have sex, only to have a sleep-deprived Maggie pass out before they do the deed.  Maggie nonetheless thinks they have, with ramifications for future episodes.  By the way, fans of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and ANGEL should look out for James Marsters (aka Spike) in this one as the Bellhop Joel talks to in the hotel after his presentation bombs at the medical conference.  Also check out the extras for a funny ad lib where Joel embraces the Bellhop.Season Three doesn't alter the alchemy that had been created in Season Two, though it did polish it.  In particular Chris achieved the importance he would possess throughout the show's run as both the town's conscience and soul.  Using his radio show ""Chris in the Morning"" (even if broadcast at night), he hovers over the town like a benevolent spirit, offering his blessing on all the inhabitants.  Though not traditionally religious in any way, NORTHERN EXPOSURE was consistently one of the most spiritual shows on TV, and without Chris that would have been impossible.  He seems to embody all the wonder about the glory of being alive that the show itself strives to communicate.  Elsewhere in Cicely, Joel continues to adjust only gradually to living in Cicely, while he and Maggie continue doing their love/hate mating dance.  Surely one reason the show's creators (and those of every other show with a potential romance) were hesitant to allow Joel and Maggie get together was because of what happened on MOONLIGHTING when David and Maddie were allowed to consummate things:  the show's ratings plunged.  As a result of the David and Maddie fiasco (though I think personally that the ratings dive of MOONLIGHTING was as much the result in a decline in the quality of the writing as having the romance come to fruition), every show since then has created as many impediments to having people attracted to one another get together as possible.  So, Joel and Maggie were emulated by Mulder and Scully, Lois and Clark, John Crichton and Aeryn Sun, Buffy and Angel (when Buffy did get a boyfriend in Riley, he significantly was one none of us cared about), and Jack and Kate.  The central romance in almost every series is like those figures in Keats's ""Ode to a Grecian Urn,"" where the lovers are always chasing but never embracing each other throughout eternity.NORTHERN EXPOSURE is fascinating from a narrative standpoint.  Beginning with HILL STREET BLUES in the early eighties, most ""quality"" shows tended to have multiple story arcs running at once, most of which did not get resolved each episode.  NORTHERN EXPOSURE actually adopted the stand alone format that dominated most television from its creation until the eighties.  Each episode would introduce two or three plot elements, all of which would be resolved by the end of that episode.  The show was almost unique in the nineties or the current decade for resolving conflict each week.  It differed from pre-HILL STREET BLUES shows, however, by constantly picking back up themes from previous shows.  The result was that you got a sense that the show had ongoing arcs, whereas in fact it merely picked back up previously resolved stories.  The only episode from Season Three where one episode immediately picks up on the previous episode was ""Our Wedding,"" in which Maggie becomes furious when she learns that she and Joel had not in fact had sex in the previous episode.Finally, this is the first set in the NORTHERN EXPOSURE series where one doesn't have to complain about the cost.  The price is comparable to other single-season sets of TV shows.  It is still almost impossible to understand the rationale in releasing Seasons One and Two in separate sets and each priced as if it were a full season.  They remain two of the most overpriced sets for any television show.  Nonetheless, if there is such a thing as ""Must See"" TV, this is as close as any series can come to ""Must Own"" TV.Note:  For those complaining about the substitution of music, this is something we just have to deal with.  If you want a culprint, don't blame Universal but the RIAA.  The demands for royalties on the original music is simply too high to make inclusion of it possible.  This is why ALLY MCBEAL has not been released on DVD and is likely never to be released.  The music on that show was too integral to allow of substitution, but the royalties are simply prohibitive to allow of a box set that anyone could afford.  As long as publishers insist on exorbitant fees we will see music substitution.  It is why they can't include the original music videos in episodes of BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD.  It is why many current TV shows employ from the start music from lesser performers.  Just don't blame Universal.  They really don't have any choice in the matter.  It's either substitute or charge $99 for each season.",5,A glorious season that represents television at its very finest,1139184000,"02 6, 2006",2006,7881,"['Season', 'Three', 'began', 'fall', '1991',

The audio is where the problem lies when talking about the Northern Exposure DVD's. Whoever decided it wise wise to change the music in parts of these episodes should be fired from Universal or at least not ever be allowed to make a decision there again. The music to Northern Exposure is an essential part of the show. Some episodes revolve around the music and to replace the music that was originally in the episodes with cheap ""faux"" music is a rediculous attempt to make more money. I love these DVD sets, but it seems odd watching them and knowing you paid all that money for them and they aren't there in the form they were when you first watched them on T.V.. I wonder if they'll replace all of the Native Indian music as well? Like on one of the later episodes when Dr. Fleischman goes to find Elaine in Seatlle. At the end of that episode there's an excellnt native American vocal song that is my favorite song in the series. Also the song ""Our Town"" tha plays at the end of the very last episode ""Tranquility Base"" is a great song and summarizes the whole series well. But that song was done by a real artist and I wonder if that song will be changed too? It would be a travesty if it was. Someone told me you can hear all of the original music if you watch the episodes with the Spanish option on. Haven't tried it myself though. The people that released the Fraks And geeks DVD's bartered and talked with all of the bands that appeared on their show's soundtrack. It took them a while, but they got all of the to sign on and were able to include all of the music that was on the show on the DVD's and still offer the DVD sets fairly cheaply. And why is there no episode listing on the DVD's or the booklet sleeve? If you want to find a certain episode, you have to keep putting the DVD's in and out of your player to see what episodes are on what disc or what episodes are on side A and B! As for the epsides themselves they are great! It is a pleasure to be able to revisit Cicely, Alaska and be in that world whenever I want to. The episodes look good and it's nice to see the entire episodes and not have 4 or 5 minutes cut out like they do for the reruns of the show.

Universal's replacement of the music is an outrage, especially in this age of director's cuts and original aspect ratios.While Universal's replacement of the music and bare-bones releases reveal that Universal just does not understand this series and its fans, they also reveal that we are unlikely to get anything better.  So you will have to decide whether you are willing to buy what Universal has released or do without the series on DVD.While I originally decided to boycott the DVDs, I begrudgingly relented after learning that the show is cut by 10% or more when shown in reruns (to allow for more commercials).  So in an ironic twist, Universal's bastardized version of this series is likely to be closer to the original intent than the versions shown in reruns.I still hate Universal for what it has done to this series, and hope that the person who made that decision suffers for it someday, but for now, I will make due with what is available.",1,Damned if you do and damned if you don't,1112227200,"03 31, 2005",2005,1089,"['What', 'many', 'feared', 'come', 'true', 'Universal', 'apparently', 'replaced', 'least', 'music', 'season', '3', 'did', 'season', '2', 'Universal', 'replacement', 'music', 'outrage', 'especially', 'age', 'director', 'cuts', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratios.While', 'Universal', 'replacement', 'music', 'bare-bones', 'releases', 'reveal', 'Universal', 'just', 'not', 'understand', 'series', 'fans', 'also', 'reveal', 'are', 'unlikely', 'get', 'anything', 'better', 'will', 'have', 'decide', 'are', 'willing', 'buy', 'what', 'Universal', 'released', 'do', 'series', 'DVD.While', 'originally', 'decided', 'boycott', 'DVDs', 'begrudgingly', 'relented', 'learning', 'show', 'cut', '10', '%', 'more', 'when', 'shown', 'reruns', 'allow', 'more', 'commercials', 'So', 'ironic', 'twist', 'Universal', 'bastardized', 'version', 'series', 'likely', 'be', 'closer', 'original', 'intent', 'versions', 'shown', 'reruns.I', 'still', 'hate', 'Universal', 'what', 'done', 'series', 'hope', 'person', 'who', 'made', 'decision', 'suffers', 'someday', 'now', 'will', 'make', 'due', 'what', 'available']",Northern Exposure: The Complete Third Season
