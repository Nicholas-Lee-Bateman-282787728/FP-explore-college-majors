528264,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00003CXKP,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[8, 14]","Does anyone have any sauce for this rotted piece of meat I would like to call a film?  It has left this dry taste in my mouth that I feel only some A1 or actual oxen blood would be able to quench.  Seriously, this was one of the worst excuses for a western film that I have seen in a very long time.  I grew up watch the ""Duke"" with my father and was always impressed with the vast landscape of the uncharted America and the troubles that faces these pioneers on a daily basis.  I expect to see that same quality or better in the westerns that are made today because we have the technology to make them stronger, more entertaining, and powerful, but I guess Texas Rangers decided to go a different route.  They decided to hire a TV director and a bunch of TV stars to help create that sense of reality in the film.  So, instead of seeing Texas through the eyes of the adventuresome, we witnessed Texas through a sound stage in Hollywood as our youth of the WB whimpered in their trailers and thought about the girls of tomorrow.  Who decided on final casting for this film?  I know the Weinsteins were not behind this, or were they?  This was the biggest hurdle to overcome in this film, and while I spent most of my energy on that, I discovered that there were actually more hurdles to follow.  The story coupled with the poor production was another hit to this already devastating picture.Let's talk about the actors that chose to place their names to this picture.  How about I actually start with a quote from Dylan McDermott from the supplemental features of this DVD.  He says something along the lines of, ""Material like this doesn't come around everyday, and when it comes to your door, you have to take it because you never know when it will be around again.""  Can we be certain he was talking about Texas Rangers?  I wonder how much he was paid for that sound bite.  The material was rated second worst behind the acting in this film.  Anyone with a 4th grade reading skill could see this.  I guess McDermott had someone else reading his work for him.  While I would say that McDermott was the only one holding this film, he continually dropped it on more than one occasion.  His character was decent, but not the greatest hero that I have seen emerge from the Mason-Dixon line.  I think what hurts him the most was that he had to work next to James Van Der Beek, who never felt like a hero to me.  I never really watched Dawson's Creek, but I have this feeling that he brought some of his character from the television show to the film.  It was embarrassing to see him act, especially during his climactic ending that seemed more like amateur night at the local bar instead of acting.  Can we be certain that this wasn't community theater we were witnessing, except with a bigger budget?  The same can be said for Randy Travis, Usher (in a very pathetic role), Kutcher (suffers miserably from miscast syndrome), and Molina (typecast for the paycheck, and it was very obvious in this film).  I think that most were so excited to be working with their friends, that they forgot that this was an actual paying role and they would need to put some work into it.  Even Rachael Leigh Cook was absurd.  Her final speech in the film had me laughing hysterically, and it wasn't intended to be funny in the least bit.  Miner completely miscast this entire film, and it is obvious from the revenue that nobody else was buying it either.With no support from the actors the story was sure to fall, and it did.  There was nothing spectacular or original about the story.  I have even read articles that state that the overall story behind this film was false and very fabricated.  How can you take yourself seriously when you are trying to make a true story from fiction?  Only Charlie Kaufmann could successfully do this and I did not see his name anywhere on the credits.  This was a shoddy piece of workmanship that does not deserve to be called either a ""western"" or a ""adventure"" or a ""drama"".  I would only use the word ""junk"" to describe what Miner has created.Overall, if you couldn't tell already, I didn't like this film.  From the opening credits until the futile ending it was nothing but pain souring through my eyes and mind as I watched the story unfold.  The ensamble acting proved that you could bring together all the wrong people and create 100% disaster.  Nobody in this film seemed to fit in the least bit.  With the actors completely miscast, the story seemed like wet paper.  Nothing was of any substance.  This was a poor excuse for a film, a poor excuse for history, and a poor excuse to try to appeal to the pre-teen girls of America.  Hopefully we have all learned a lesson from this and can move on without any troubles.  GULP.

528265,A1GAD2WH9NDOUR,B00003CXKP,Bookworm,"[2, 5]","Well, I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed in this movie. I mean, the basic idea was good, and I'm sure someone could have made a decent movie out of it if they had 1) fired the writer and gotten a better script, and 2) done a better job casting actors who actually fit into this kind of movie. Dylan McDermott, Robert Patrick, James van der Beek, Rachael Leigh Cook - they are all good actors, but neither one of them (with the possible exception of Rachael) fits into a Western movie at all. Same goes for Ashton Kutcher, who is cute but should stick to teen comedies and the likes!!! I am absolutely convinced that a better script and different actors could have made this movie into a hit!!!The way it is now, though, the story is simply going nowhere ... actually, there isn't even a real story that runs from beginning to end ... instead, there's just many events thrown together with no connection (or explanation) whatsoever - I mean, the whole movie doesn't make any sense at all! After watching it, I still have no idea what is happening or why it is happening ... the only possible explanation I can find is that maybe they cut and re-cut this movie so many times that not even the director knew where the story was supposed to go anymore.The only reason why I even finished watching the movie was that I kept thinking ""There's got to be more ... this has got to get better 'cause it sure can't get any worse ...""! If you want to see this movie real bad for some reason then rent it or wait till they show it on TV - don't waste your money on buying it!!!",2,"Good idea, bad script, worse casting!",1022112000,"05 23, 2002",2002,1572,"['Well', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'mean', 'basic', 'idea', 'was', 'good', ""'m"", 'sure', 'someone', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'decent', 'movie', 'had', '1', 'fired', 'writer', 'gotten', 'better', 'script', '2', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'casting', 'actors', 'who', 'actually', 'fit', 'kind', 'movie', 'Dylan', 'McDermott', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'James', 'van', 'der', 'Beek', 'Rachael', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'are', 'good', 'actors', 'one', 'possible', 'exception', 'Rachael', 'Western', 'movie', 'Same', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'who', 'cute', 'should', 'stick', 'teen', 'comedies', 'likes', 'am', 'absolutely', 'convinced', 'better', 'script', 'different', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'hit', 'way', 'now', 'story', 'simply', 'going', 'nowhere', 'actually', ""n't"", 'even', 'real', 'story', 'beginning', 'end', 'instead', 'just', 'many', 'events', 'together', 'connection', 'explanation', 'mean', 'whole', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'watching', 'still', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'happening', 'why', 'happening', 'only', 'possible', 'explanation', 'can', 'find', 'maybe', 'cut', 're-cut', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'not', 'even', 'director', 'knew', 'where', 'story', 'was', 'supposed', 'go', 'anymore.The', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'even', 'finished', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'kept', 'thinking', 'got', 'be', 'more', 'got', 'get', 'better', 'sure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'worse', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'real', 'bad', 'reason', 'then', 'rent', 'wait', 'show', 'TV', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'buying']",Texas Rangers

528268,AB34G6VKP28L,B00003CXKP,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[8, 9]","In the after-effects of the Civil War, Texas is a sleeping giant falling prey to vicious marauding and theft by Mexican invaders. The Rangers were disbanded to fight for the South; now they are to be regrouped, with a former pastor-turned-lawman, Leander McNelly (Dylan McDermott), in he lead. Persuaded by the government to undertake the training and leadership of thirty rag-taggled, half-bit schoolboy-turned-lawmen, McNelly finds himself at odds not only with his own priorities and shaken faith, but his inability in leadership.One member of this poor crop of unshaven boys is Dunnison (James Van Der Beek), whose family was slaughtered by the Mexicans. Due to his writing talents, he is chosen as McNelly's personal aid and undertakes documenting all of the reports to Washington.With very little time for training, the Rangers saddle up and ride off to meet their fates. But prejudice, poor shooting skills and mistakes are the least of McNelly's problems. There is also a traitor among them... a character who will turncoat... and a violent climax in Mexico.Texas Rangers (PG13) has a good heart and could have been a great film. It's been a long time since there's been a truly excellent western on the market -- not since Jimmy Stewart donned his white hat and rode into the west. Sadly, this one will not fill the void. The fact that the film was not pre-released for the press is a dead giveaway that something is lacking. The acting is excellent -- pity the scriptwriters didn't give Dylan McDermott and Rachael Leigh Cook more to work with. The soundtrack is gorgeous -- will it be released? Probably not, considering the big-screen failure of the film.The movie abounds with clever camera angles, gorgeous photography and costuming, and truly unanticipated moments -- ambushes, traitors, and clever banter. Sadly it is based more on gunfights and cheap thrills than pliable emotional conflict. Characters are under-developed; we hope they don't get killed but don't really have a reason why. The female leads in particular are too overlooked, the actresses unable to exhibit their full potential. What this film desperately needed was a side plot or a stronger main plot to draw from -- more emotion, less coldness. Perhaps a stronger romance; more background information. Too many characters are left in the lurch, their personalities trailing off as if the writer didn't know what to do with them.In conclusion, it was worth a matinee. I came away sorry for the under-development and violence, but willing to watch it again on video or DVD (prefurably a Director's Cut). If you like the tradition of old westerns, &quot;Texas Rangers&quot; fits the bill. But if you shy away from nonstop violence and cheap character development, you may want to pass this one over for a Christmas blockbuster. It had a lot of potential... but was too slow on the draw.",3,Misses the Bullet,1008201600,"12 13, 2001",2001,2869,"['after-effects', 'Civil', 'War', 'Texas', 'sleeping', 'giant', 'falling', 'prey', 'vicious', 'marauding', 'theft', 'Mexican', 'invaders', 'Rangers', 'were', 'disbanded', 'fight', 'South', 'now', 'are', 'be', 'regrouped', 'former', 'pastor-turned-lawman', 'Leander', 'McNelly', 'Dylan', 'McDermott', 'lead', 'Persuaded', 'government', 'undertake', 'training', 'leadership', 'thirty', 'rag-taggled', 'half-bit', 'schoolboy-turned-lawmen', 'McNelly', 'odds', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'priorities', 'shaken', 'faith', 'inability', 'leadership.One', 'member', 'poor', 'crop', 'unshaven', 'boys', 'Dunnison', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'family', 'was', 'slaughtered', 'Mexicans', 'Due', 'writing', 'talents', 'chosen', 'McNelly', 'personal', 'aid', 'undertakes', 'documenting', 'reports', 'Washington.With', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'training', 'Rangers', 'saddle', 'up', 'ride', 'off', 'meet', 'fates', 'prejudice', 'poor', 'shooting', 'skills', 'mistakes', 'are', 'least', 'McNelly', 'problems', 'also', 'traitor', 'character', 'who', 'will', 'turncoat', 'violent', 'climax', 'Mexico.Texas', 'Rangers', 'PG13', 'good', 'heart', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'been', 'truly', 'excellent', 'western', 'market', 'not', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'donned', 'white', 'hat', 'rode', 'west', 'Sadly', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'fill', 'void', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'pre-released', 'press', 'dead', 'giveaway', 'something', 'lacking', 'acting', 'excellent', 'pity', 'scriptwriters', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'Dylan', 'McDermott', 'Rachael', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'more', 'work', 'soundtrack', 'gorgeous', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'Probably', 'not', 'considering', 'big-screen', 'failure', 'film.The', 'movie', 'clever', 'camera', 'angles', 'gorgeous', 'photography', 'costuming', 'truly', 'unanticipated', 'moments', 'ambushes', 'traitors', 'clever', 'banter', 'Sadly', 'based', 'more', 'gunfights', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'pliable', 'emotional', 'conflict', 'Characters', 'are', 'under-developed', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'killed', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'reason', 'why', 'female', 'leads', 'particular', 'are', 'too', 'overlooked', 'actresses', 'unable', 'exhibit', 'full', 'potential', 'What', 'film', 'desperately', 'needed', 'was', 'side', 'plot', 'stronger', 'main', 'plot', 'draw', 'more', 'emotion', 'less', 'coldness', 'Perhaps', 'stronger', 'romance', 'more', 'background', 'information', 'Too', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'left', 'lurch', 'personalities', 'trailing', 'off', 'writer', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'them.In', 'conclusion', 'was', 'worth', 'matinee', 'came', 'away', 'sorry', 'under-development', 'violence', 'willing', 'watch', 'again', 'video', 'DVD', 'prefurably', 'Director', 'Cut', 'like', 'tradition', 'old', 'westerns', 'quot', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'quot', 'bill', 'shy', 'away', 'nonstop', 'violence', 'cheap', 'character', 'development', 'may', 'want', 'pass', 'one', 'over', 'Christmas', 'blockbuster', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'was', 'too', 'slow', 'draw']",Texas Rangers

So from time to time the mood hits me and I dig into the crates for a western. One day upon doing so I picked up this flick since I live in Texas and the Rangers actually are a real thing. In fact the people in this story are based on real people but the flick is not accurate with all the facts. That's ok though since it is an entertaining movie.The story follows Leander McNelly 10 years after the Civil War at a time when he is asked by the governor of Texas to bring back the Texas Rangers. John King Fisher is stealing cattle from some wealthy people and taking them across the border. So McNelly brings back a few guys who used to be Rangers alongside him but the majority of the new group are a bunch of young new guys who need a lot of training. This lack of training and the over confidence of the veterans leads to a slaughter during the first attempt to stop King and his gang. So after such a big loss will they be able to pull together to get the job done, or will the outlaws reign supreme.Now this is not the greatest western film ever made but it is a fun one. The actors here do a great job in the film and over all it is a fun flick. The storyline here is an interesting one and the film moves at a good pace so it never seems to slow down. Still it is not a perfect flick and I will admit that, although I did really enjoy the film. The script could have used some work and the acting at times seems off, even still I liked this flick.James Van Der Beek is not annoying here like some have said; I thought he played the role well. Usher of R&B; fame as some of you may know him is good here as well. Still I think he was better in ""Light it Up"", but as the film goes on he seems to settle into the role. Ashton Kutcher is very Ashton Kutcherish in this film but the character called for it I guess. Alfred Molina is great as always and Randy Travis is great as well, he of course is another singer on the film, country. Still my favorite here is Dylan McDermott; something about the character is cool to me.Now like I said earlier this is based on real people and events but the story does take liberties.

528275,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B00003CXKP,Get What We Give,"[6, 10]","Hot off the popularity of their television shows, James Van der Beek (Dawson's Creek) and Ashton Kutcher (That 70's Show) attempt to score big on the big screen.  That has since happened, but this film wasn't the reason why.The producers were obviously attempting to throw quantity not quality at the big screen, since they employed a host of well known television actors and a couple of singers.  You have Dylan McDermott as the Captain in charge, Robert Patrick, Matt Keeslar, Usher Raymond, Tom Skerritt, and even Randy Travis.  As an after thought they've even thrown in Rachel Leigh Cook as the token female character.The acting is never bad, it's just that there's really not much going on here to warrant any excitement.  You can sit and watch this film from beginning to end without blinking and you'll swear that you must have missed something.  That's what makes this simplistic film bad.The plot is super simple:  bad men kill innocent people.  Young studly guys band together as the ""Texas Rangers"" to right the wrongs, but not for revenge.Unfortunately, this story doesn't have oomph to make it any good.  Alfred Molina, as the bad guy, just never comes off quite as bad as he should.  The reason?  A fine actor, Molina seems to be bored and somewhat ashamed to be in such a stinker.  He does bad things but he never comes off as evil or homicidal or even psycho.  This movie really begs for a Bruce Dern in ""The Cowboys"".And the good guys...these guys are apparently sharing one brain among the 30 of them.  In one fight scene, they come charging in a single line across the plains to a wooded area where the bad guys are holed up with tons of places to hide.  Of course the good guys are masacred.  Since no one bother to introduce us to any of the good guys beyond the major players, we really can't care too much if any of the good guys get killed.  In fact, I was hoping that more of them would be killed off - they really started to annoy me.In short, Texas Rangers is long on being a Teen Beat homage and short on being a real western.  There is very little character development in either the good or bad guy camps and there is no storyline, but the central one.  I think there was an attempt to throw in a love story angle, but it gets lost when Kutcher jumps in the tub with van der Beek.This film isn't the worst I've seen, but it certainly isn't even noteworthy.If you want to see a bunch of your favorite television studs in a cowboy outfits, then by all means rent this.  Otherwise rent a decent western, such as The Cowboys, Rooster Cogburn, Shane, or Tombstone.",2,Texas Rangers stinks up the screen - in cowboy outfits!,1059955200,"08 4, 2003",2003,2590,"['Hot', 'off', 'popularity', 'television', 'shows', 'James', 'Van', 'der', 'Beek', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', '70', 'Show', 'attempt', 'score', 'big', 'big', 'screen', 'happened', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'reason', 'why.The', 'producers', 'were', 'obviously', 'attempting', 'throw', 'quantity', 'not', 'quality', 'big', 'screen', 'employed', 'host', 'well', 'known', 'television', 'actors', 'couple', 'singers', 'have', 'Dylan', 'McDermott', 'Captain', 'charge', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Matt', 'Keeslar', 'Usher', 'Raymond', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'even', 'Randy', 'Travis', 'thought', ""'ve"", 'even', 'thrown', 'Rachel', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'token', 'female', 'character.The', 'acting', 'never', 'bad', 'just', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'going', 'here', 'warrant', 'excitement', 'can', 'sit', 'watch', 'film', 'beginning', 'end', 'blinking', ""'ll"", 'swear', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'something', 'what', 'simplistic', 'film', 'bad.The', 'plot', 'super', 'simple', 'bad', 'men', 'kill', 'innocent', 'people', 'Young', 'studly', 'guys', 'band', 'together', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'right', 'wrongs', 'not', 'revenge.Unfortunately', 'story', ""n't"", 'have', 'oomph', 'make', 'good', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'bad', 'guy', 'just', 'never', 'off', 'quite', 'as', 'bad', 'should', 'reason', 'fine', 'actor', 'Molina', 'be', 'bored', 'somewhat', 'ashamed', 'be', 'such', 'stinker', 'bad', 'things', 'never', 'off', 'evil', 'homicidal', 'even', 'psycho', 'movie', 'really', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Cowboys', 'good', 'guys', 'guys', 'are', 'apparently', 'sharing', 'one', 'brain', '30', 'one', 'fight', 'scene', 'come', 'charging', 'single', 'line', 'plains', 'wooded', 'area', 'where', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'holed', 'up', 'tons', 'places', 'hide', 'course', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'masacred', 'one', 'bother', 'introduce', 'good', 'guys', 'major', 'players', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'guys', 'get', 'killed', 'fact', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'killed', 'off', 'really', 'started', 'annoy', 'me.In', 'short', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'long', 'being', 'Teen', 'Beat', 'homage', 'short', 'being', 'real', 'western', 'very', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'good', 'bad', 'guy', 'camps', 'storyline', 'central', 'one', 'think', 'was', 'attempt', 'throw', 'love', 'story', 'angle', 'lost', 'when', 'Kutcher', 'tub', 'van', 'der', 'Beek.This', 'film', ""n't"", 'worst', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'even', 'noteworthy.If', 'want', 'see', 'bunch', 'favorite', 'television', 'studs', 'cowboy', 'then', 'means', 'rent', 'Otherwise', 'rent', 'decent', 'western', 'such', 'Cowboys', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'Shane', 'Tombstone']",Texas Rangers

The location scenery definitely proves that. Anyone familiar with the Brownsville area can see a total mis-representation. Why did the filmmakers not go to Bracketteville, TX to film. Bracketteville and the surrounding area is the home location to may great westerns; i.e.: The Alamo, Bandolero!, Lonesome Dove, Bad Girls, just to name a few. And the landscape is more appropriate to representing the Brownsville area. The movie took a lot of liberties with actual events, also. The movie was based on the book, ""Taming the Nueces Strip"" by George Durham as told to Clyde Wantland. George Durham was a real person who's exploits with McNelly's Rangers are well told. In ""Texas Rangers."" Durham is nothing more than a minor character,played by Ashton Kutcher,  represented as the friend of the central character,Lincoln Rogers Dunnison (who was he?), played by James Van Der Beek. If the movie had followed the real historical events as they really happened as told by Durham, it would have been a much better movie.

""The Texas Rangers"" puts the focus on a time in Texas history when violent gangs rode into towns and took what they wanted and killed anyone they felt like killing.  The Rangers banded together to stop them.  It's a violent story, yes, but it's rooted in American history.  Also, there are some very good actors in this movie, and I was pleased to see that Randy Travis was in it. Any movie that is tied to American history and keeps the viewer interested is worth seeing.

The cast may be ensamble for the most part, but Dylan steals the show. It is unfortunate that ""Texas Rangers"" didn't enjoy a wide release last November.
