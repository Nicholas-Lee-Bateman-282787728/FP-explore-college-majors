As fate would have it, I saw it on TV when I was no older than 10--far too young to care about acting, budget, etc. All I wanted was a scary movie; and I got what I wanted.Years later (today, to be exact), I jumped at the chance to rent it. Being 18 now, there were some things that I thought were way silly, but I'm still in a state of &quot;shock&quot; that I go through after one of those movies that moves you. Perhaps I was merely moved because of the sentimental value of this film, and the fact that I love Europe &amp; mythology.

Soon, people start to disappear and someone says she saw a strange, big animal. Maybe there's some truth on the werewolf legends after all.....This is a typical ""a group of people gather in a strange place and get killed one after the other while they try to figure out what's happening""-movie, and like many movies of its kind, it suffers from lack of any real plot, and has too many characters that you never really get to know. Especially in the beginning there are a number of scenes with lots of unimportant dialogue. The acting is like in most b-grade horror movies not very good.This movie is better than ""Howling III"", but not good as ""The Howling"" or ""Howling IV"" and not as funny as ""Howling II"".

256233,A3BMZYA7CT2E74,6301576152,G. Garner,"[0, 0]","This film takes a premise similar to the one used in 'And Then There Were None'-the Agatha Christie classic-or the original 'Friday the 13th'..........namely, they take a bunch of people, put them in a creepy, enclosed environment, and then introduce a killer who dispatches them one by one. But in this case, the distinction lies in the fact that the killer is a werewolf.I loved this movie. The cast is, by and large, pretty good. Most of these people are not old, but they are adults-in their 30's and 40's-and this is refreshing for a horror movie. This is not a werewolf movie that emphasizes prolonged transformation sequences, or werewolf orgies, or inordinate amounts of gore. Thus, it will not please everybody. It is more like a slasher movie, where the killer just happens to be a werewolf rather than the typical psychopath or bogeyman.Some of the guests are there for the express purpose of killing the beast. However, since they are not sure exactly WHO their adversary might be, they pose a threat to the innocent as well as the guilty. This leads to a final twenty minutes or so that are engaging and loaded with intrigue, as the guests resort to various ways of trying to defend themselves.It is interesting that the person who ultimately winds up being the most humane, and the most moral, of the group is the one who seemed the most narcissistic and self-absorbed in the beginning.The climax of this movie is outstanding. It is rivetting, suspenseful..........and, in its own way, beautiful, with the full moon now being brought to bear in the proceedings in a way that it had not heretofore.But the final twenty seconds take this movie to a whole other level, entirely. A truly great ending, one of the best endings of any horror film of the 80's. It is just SO subtle, SO understated.......And yet so unmistakeable. It is a moment that stays with you.......as will its implications. Like I've said before, it's not just WHAT you do, but oftentimes, it is HOW you do it, that makes all the difference. This ending is a brilliant climax to an absolutely outstanding movie.",5,The Howling 5-Probably My Favorite Werewolf Movie,1329523200,"02 18, 2012",2012,2091,"['film', 'premise', 'similar', 'one', 'used', ""'And"", 'Then', 'Were', ""None'-the"", 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'classic-or', 'original', '13th', '.namely', 'take', 'bunch', 'people', 'put', 'creepy', 'enclosed', 'environment', 'then', 'introduce', 'killer', 'who', 'one', 'one', 'case', 'distinction', 'fact', 'killer', 'werewolf.I', 'loved', 'movie', 'cast', 'large', 'pretty', 'good', 'Most', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'old', 'are', 'adults-in', '30', ""40's-and"", 'refreshing', 'horror', 'movie', 'not', 'werewolf', 'movie', 'prolonged', 'transformation', 'sequences', 'werewolf', 'orgies', 'inordinate', 'amounts', 'gore', 'Thus', 'will', 'not', 'please', 'everybody', 'more', 'slasher', 'movie', 'where', 'killer', 'just', 'be', 'werewolf', 'rather', 'typical', 'psychopath', 'bogeyman.Some', 'guests', 'are', 'there', 'express', 'purpose', 'killing', 'beast', 'However', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'exactly', 'WHO', 'adversary', 'might', 'be', 'pose', 'threat', 'innocent', 'as', 'well', 'guilty', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'are', 'engaging', 'loaded', 'intrigue', 'guests', 'resort', 'various', 'ways', 'trying', 'defend', 'themselves.It', 'interesting', 'person', 'who', 'ultimately', 'up', 'being', 'most', 'humane', 'most', 'moral', 'group', 'one', 'who', 'seemed', 'most', 'narcissistic', 'self-absorbed', 'beginning.The', 'climax', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'rivetting', 'suspenseful', '.and', 'own', 'way', 'beautiful', 'full', 'moon', 'now', 'being', 'brought', 'bear', 'proceedings', 'way', 'had', 'not', 'heretofore.But', 'final', 'twenty', 'seconds', 'take', 'movie', 'whole', 'other', 'level', 'entirely', 'truly', 'great', 'ending', 'one', 'best', 'endings', 'horror', 'film', '80', 'just', 'SO', 'subtle', 'SO', 'understated', '.And', 'yet', 'so', 'unmistakeable', 'moment', '.as', 'will', 'implications', ""'ve"", 'said', 'not', 'just', 'WHAT', 'do', 'oftentimes', 'HOW', 'do', 'difference', 'ending', 'brilliant', 'climax', 'absolutely', 'outstanding', 'movie']",N/A
256234,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,6301576152,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 0]","The Rebirth of what?  Unrelated to the rest of the franchise, this stand alone is designed more like a slasher flick and deviates from the pack theme created by The Howling (1981).  You don't see much happen and the monster is saved for the finale, but the mood is alright.  But I'd skip it.  It's simply not eventful enough.This sequel has all the makings of a stand alone, pick'em off one by one flick.  A group of people of various backgrounds are brought together by a strange host in a Hungarian castle which has been sealed for 500 years&#8230;oh, and a werewolf tags along and whittles down their numbers.Among these tourists are tennis player Jonathan (Mark Sivertsen; Vampires, The Last Stand), actress Marylou Summers (Elizabeth Sh&eacute;; Howling VI: Freaks, Howling: New Moon Rising), Dr. Catherine Peake (Victoria Catlin; Maniac Cop, Ghoulies), actress Anna (Mary Stavin; House), a professor, a writer, a model, a photographer and all other sorts.  The deliberately creepy Count Istvan (Philip Davis; Alien 3) hosts the trip.Following the standard slasher-horror formula, within 30 minutes someone is killed by a killer we barely glimpse, people are already pairing off and getting intimate, and a few patrons begin to feel that this trip is some sort of set up designed to trap them in the castle as a result of a terrible storm.  As the story continues we learn more about who's in on this &#34;set up.&#34;In the spirit of totally random horror movie flavor, our victims end up in a vast catacombed labyrinth under the castle where the werewolf, as if in a videogame or Greek myth, wanders about as a monstrous hazard.  As silly as this is, it works and fits in well in this tolerably decent bad 80s horror.  What doesn't work is that we see very little of the werewolf very rarely, the gore is only after the fact, and there was no transformation scene.  You can't do a werewolf movie and have no transformation scene!!!I didn't hate this but I wouldn't recommend it either.  While I enjoyed the mood and setting, the gore is too minimal and we see too little to garner enough interest.FRANCHISE/SEQUEL NOTE:  I find no story-based connection between this, The Howling (1981; the best of the series), Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf (1985; random and hilarious), Howling 3: The Marsupials (1987; still a lot of weird fun) or Howling V (1989).  Howling IV: The Original Nightmare (1988) tried and horribly failed to remake the excellence of part one while being more true to the book and The Howling Reborn (2011) was a reboot with a contemporary spin.",3,"Good mood and setting, but ""The Rebirth"" of what?

It's basically a whodunit a la Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None."" It's also reminiscent of the underrated ""Devil's Nightmare"" aka ""The Devil Walks at Midnight"" (1971), albeit not as good.Still, it comes close, and although the werewolf is barely seen I found this a solid low-budget mystery flick with a werewolf. Besides, Elizabeth Sh&eacute; (Marylou) has an exceptional scene and there's a superb gothic score.
