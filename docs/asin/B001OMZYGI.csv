Sessler ""AniMason""","[3, 10]","Meet Roy, he used to be an officer who played by the rules but, turned bounty hunter when losing his daughter to a mysterious event known as the blast fall. When out on a job gone wrong, a strange girl intervenes to save Roy, her name is Solty.From this point on, the plot takes a major detour which will undeniably leave you wondering, what just happened and why does it seem like every episode, someone different is crying about absolutely nothing. Now don't get me wrong, I can appreciate dramatic series with heavy moments emphasized by crying characters. But, even this was a bit much. Then the icing on the cake, the fittingly climactic moment followed by one of those ridiculous, many years later sub titles, where all we see is only two characters from a larger cast sharing a completely useless moment. Where do you think blank is? says 1. I'm sure blank is out there somewhere and everything is fine, says 2.

1222933,AFXTKAO0CB354,B001OMZYGI,C. Weaver,"[2, 2]",I really liked this series. It had just the right amouint of what I expect from an anime series. The main character at first makes you wonder what's going on and the being pick up by a guy whose kid was hurt by what the main character was involved in makes it all the more interesting.

I think another season needs to be made. I strongely thing another season would be really cool because I think everyone including myself wants to know what happen to Solty after they find her.

The story line is simple, Detached male figure encounters mysterious girl. He stubbornly tries to keep her at a distance, while she miraculously wiggles her way into not only his life, but his heart.Roy is a bounty hunter, Solty is a ""Well let say unique"" they end up working together which takes them down a path of a father daughter relationship. They have a couple of great friends that are involved in Roy's line of work and they have a few that are on the wrong side of the law, but with ""Robin Hood"" like intentions. As the show unfolds, the simple plot of catching bad guys, turns out to be connected to something much larger. A scheme that endangers the entire city and the lives of everyone in it. Solty, Roy and their companions stand together to stop Catastrophe from happening. This show has a great deal of growth between the characters, lots of laughs, and a few ""good"" tears. You just can't help getting attached to the characters, and relating to their experiences and emotions.

Many people were hurt during the ""Blast Fall"", and have cybernetic implants that give them super human strength. Roy is a bounty hunter who lost his family in the disaster. One day he is saved by a girl with no name or memory. He takes her in and names her Solty. Solty's body is almost entirely cybernetic. Her past is a mystery that holds some very shocking secrets and revelations about the current state of the world.This anime took me by surprise. It's story is pretty unique and very interesting. The animation, voice acting, and music are all very good. The massive amount of cool characters is also a plus. There is also a good mix of action, drama, and comedy in it as well. The drama is very emotional at times. I bought this anime when it was new and payed an okay price for it, but now a S.A.V.E. edition is even better. I definitely recommend this anime to any fan.

It's a rare gem, a diamond in the rough, if you will.The story's fairly simplistic. A man searching for his missing daughter meets a girl with no memory of her past. Together they, along with others they come across, try to find answers and, in the long run, create a bond (willingly on her part, warily on his).There's more to the story than that but it is better to see and experience it for yourself rather than sit and read someone else's impression, at least in my humble opinion.So, if you like sci-fi, action, adventure, robot-girls; then Solty Rei is something you might enjoy.",5,An Anime Classic,1339718400,"06 15, 2012",2012,633,"['Solty', 'Rei', 'what', 'kindled', 'passion', 'Anime', 'rare', 'gem', 'diamond', 'rough', 'will.The', 'story', 'fairly', 'simplistic', 'man', 'searching', 'missing', 'daughter', 'girl', 'memory', 'past', 'Together', 'others', 'come', 'try', 'find', 'answers', 'long', 'run', 'create', 'bond', 'willingly', 'part', 'warily', 'more', 'story', 'better', 'see', 'experience', 'rather', 'sit', 'read', 'someone', 'else', 'impression', 'least', 'humble', 'opinion.So', 'like', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'adventure', 'robot-girls', 'then', 'Solty', 'Rei', 'something', 'might', 'enjoy']",Solty Rei: The Complete Viridian Collection
