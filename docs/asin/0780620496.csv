30077,A3Q6KNHE70J4LA,0780620496,Alyn S. Rumbold,"[0, 0]","""For Roseanna"" is a wonderfully sweet romantic comedy about a loving husband and his devotion to his dying wife. The film is full of charismatic performances, but Jean Reno steals the show by a narrow margin. Mercedes Ruehl is also warm and lovely in the title role. For a story so focused on the subject of death, the character of Marcello is the embodiment of vitality, and his various efforts to keep his fellow townsmen alive so they don't take up the last graves in the village cemetery are hilarious. Having seen Reno more typically in dramatic roles in movies such as ""The Professional,"" ""Mission: Impossible,"" and ""Ronin,"" I was impressed with the very gifted comic range that he demonstrates here. With very fine talented supporting performances from Polly Walker, Trevor Peacock, Renato Scarpa, Roberto Della Casa, and Mark Frankel (tragically, his final performance), this is a little jewel of a movie.

30082,A29VKODW4R5U7W,0780620496,dooby,"[16, 17]","This is a lovely movie. It was originally entitled ""Roseanna's Grave"". In its offbeat way, it tells of the love between a middle-aged man and his dying wife.  Marcello, played by Jean Reno, has made a promise to his ailing wife, Roseanna (Mercedes Ruehl). He will make sure that when she dies, she will be buried next to their beloved child. Despite the rapidly diminishing number of plots in the town's overcrowded cemetery, he intends to keep his promise. He goes to great, even absurd lengths, to ensure that the other townsfolk do not die first and deprive his wife of that last available plot. When one of Marcello's friends dies in an accident, he hides the body in a freezer. When the family of a man declared brain-dead wants to turn off his life support, he pretends to hear the man speak. He fusses constantly over the health of all the townsfolk. It may all sound rather morbid but the film plays out very sweetly and with a gentle humour that often brims over into hilarity. His equally devoted wife meanwhile tries to pair him off with her younger sister, Cecilia, played by the lovely Polly Walker (Enchanted April). Unfortunately they can't stand each other. A little twist at the end allows the couple to live out one last dream before the final curtain call. It is an uplifting ending and one that will leave you smiling.It's rare to come across a movie that brings you close to tears one moment and have you laughing with joy the next. And though it does not pretend to conquer death, it does push its characters to live life to the fullest. For all the laughter and light-hearted comedy, it is the film's portrayal of the love between the aging couple that makes this charming comedy special.Although this is an American production, it is set in Italy, the cast is mainly Italian and it has a very Italianate feel to it. It is almost like watching an Italian film. It certainly doesn't feel like something coming out of Hollywood. ""For Roseanna"" was filmed in the lovely hill country around Sermoneta in central Italy. The photography is gorgeous.New Line Home Entertainment has produced a fine DVD with a lovely transfer in the film's original 2.35:1 widescreen (anamorphic). It also includes a fullscreen pan-&-scan version. Picture quality in the widescreen version is lovely. Crisp, clear and generally clean with only very occasional nicks on the print. Colors are bright and natural. Black levels are just right. Sound is in the original English Dolby 5.1 and a dubbed Spanish Dolby 5.1. There are optional English and Spanish subtitles. Aside from the theatrical trailer there are no other extras. Still it's worth the price just to be able to watch this seldom-seen, almost unheard of little treat. It's good to know that Hollywood, in between its multi-million-dollar blockbusters, can still make such little gems.",5,A Valentine for Roseanna...

But you can't hit a home run at every bat. And even then - he was one of the few bright spots in that forgettable flick.'For Roseanna' is a wonderfully sweet dark comedy about Marcello (Reno) a small town restauranteur desperate to honor his terminally ill wife's last wish: To be buried next to their daughter in the tiny town cemetery. The problem? There are only three plots left and there are already two very aged residents on their death beds.Marcello will do *anything* to insure that no one else takes that final resting place from his wife. No one.Unfortunately, fate comically intervenes and suddenly there are dead bodies piling up everywhere! :-DLoved the tricky opening scene! I feared that I was about to watch some asinine art-house movie about the ubiquitous ""Sad European Clowns"" - God save me from the pretentious cirqu&eacute; and hit the fast forward. But just as quickly, you realize something very odd about Reno's character, and the laughs never stop from there.A very tender and sweet love story that happens to occur amongst the hilarious unexpected demise of several townsfolk and one hellaciously focused old criminal.I suppose the one knock I have against this excellent film - the accents. Only Reno, whose generic European, passes for Italian-accented English. The always enjoyable Polly Walker's UK accented Italian is only mildly off-mark. But Mercedes Ruehl and her New Yawk accent... ugh. But since no one in the main cast actually is Italian and no one is actually speaking Italian, all can be forgiven since the story told is so awesome.And wow, I had forgotten how stunningly handsomeMark Frankel (ignore the creepy dvd cover artwork)was; today's audience really lost out when he died at such a young age (34yrs) and at a time when his career was just about to take off.

30092,A20ETKDAEM1CBY,0780620496,"R. Griffiths ""bookchoice""","[1, 1]","This is the kind of movie a wide range of people will enjoy. For a start, it taps into that ever popular theme of 'gentle comedy in small-town Italy'. If you've enjoyed 'Cinema Paradiso', 'Il Postino' or 'Life is Beautiful', you'll want to see this too. It has the same successful mix of scenery, music and eccentric characters. Watching this feels as though the wine bars and winding streets have come to your living room. Unlike the films just mentioned, however, this isn't really an Italian movie at all - it's all in English, with the characters affecting  Italian accents with varying degrees of success and authenticity. Still, the accents are not too grating - you get used to them quite quickly - and its easy to enter into the spirit of the movie's premise. It helps greatly that the location filming is superb. The town is shown in all its slightly shoddy beauty. Nothing seems 'tarted up' for the camera, and this gives the whole a sense of realism to counterbalance the admittedly incredible plot. While this is absolutely a comedy, with some very funny moments, there is still a serious undertone - it all revolves around the wishes of a dying woman. The pain of love, requited and unrequited, is explored most sensitively. There are moments that will bring you to tears.",4,Italy in your living room!,974073600,"11 13, 2000",2000,1285,"['kind', 'movie', 'wide', 'range', 'people', 'will', 'enjoy', 'start', 'ever', 'popular', 'theme', ""'gentle"", 'comedy', 'small-town', 'Italy', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Paradiso', 'Postino', ""'Life"", 'Beautiful', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'too', 'same', 'successful', 'mix', 'scenery', 'music', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'Watching', 'feels', 'wine', 'bars', 'winding', 'streets', 'have', 'come', 'living', 'room', 'films', 'just', 'mentioned', 'however', ""n't"", 'really', 'Italian', 'movie', 'English', 'characters', 'affecting', 'Italian', 'accents', 'varying', 'degrees', 'success', 'authenticity', 'Still', 'accents', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'grating', 'get', 'used', 'quite', 'quickly', 'easy', 'enter', 'spirit', 'movie', 'premise', 'greatly', 'location', 'filming', 'superb', 'town', 'shown', 'slightly', 'shoddy', 'beauty', 'Nothing', ""'tarted"", 'up', 'camera', 'whole', 'sense', 'realism', 'counterbalance', 'admittedly', 'incredible', 'plot', 'absolutely', 'comedy', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'still', 'serious', 'undertone', 'around', 'wishes', 'dying', 'woman', 'pain', 'love', 'requited', 'unrequited', 'explored', 'most', 'sensitively', 'are', 'moments', 'will', 'bring', 'tears']",For Roseanna VHS
