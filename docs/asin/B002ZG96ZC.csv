1300262,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B002ZG96ZC,A. Estes,"[6, 10]","Kevin Smith's first directing gig that he didn't write himself, ""Cop Out,"" finds the director re-teaming with hisLive Free or Die Hardco-star, Bruce Willis, as well as Tracy Morgan and Seann William Scott, who were both featured in his 2001 film and quite possibly the biggest inside-joke put to film,Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.More than that, though, the film is a brilliant throwback to the glory days of such 80's buddy cop franchises asLethal WeaponandBeverly Hills Cop. You'll recognize key dialog from the former while the composer for the latter, Harold Faltermeyer, makes a glorious return to the genre with a quirky retro score that sets the mood just right. Bruce Willis plays the straight-man to Tracy Morgan's...well...Tracy Morgan is really just playing every character he's ever played here, but the way in which he bounces off of Willis (who himself seems to be trying hard to keep a straight face in many scenes) keeps it from feeling tired or stale. While this odd-couple/cop formula has been done to death in the past, it works for this film and is done in a loving way that pays tribute rather than re-hashes.Smith, whose films are mostly talk, proves himself to be a competent action director at times throughout the film. It's funny to think that the man who madeClerksmade a polished studio film such as this, but it's a sign of maturity more than selling-out, so rest easy fanboys. The script by Mark & Robb Cullen is whip-smart, witty and never leaves you longing for a laugh. Even if you don't gel with the story about a rare baseball card landing into the lap of a high-powered drug-lord, you'll always find yourself laughing along with the film. It also helps, too, that each and every player seems to have had a good time making the film, and that translates into the final result.One could make the argument that Smith himself could have re-written the film and made it all the funnier, but much of the humor in the film comes from the on-screen chemistry. It's about as good of an 80's buddy cop throwback as you'll get, and is rounded out with a brilliant cast that also includes Guillermo Diaz, Kevin Pollak, Adam Brody and Jason Lee, among others. Go into expecting a simple yet effective way of just how fun an action movie can be. As for Smith, he's shown significant range, and hopefully the film will help break him out from just being the guy who directed those Jay & Silent Bob flicks.

I was VERY disappointed, though, and the film's biggest problem can be summed up in two words: Tracy Morgan. Unfunny, whining, and constantly mugging at the camera, Morgan may be Willis' worst co-star, ever (How bad is he? Seann William Scott, with less than 10 minutes of screen time, has more laughs than Morgan provides, the entire film). Willis spends most of ""Cop Out"" simply staring at Morgan and his unrelenting stream of chatter (director Smith, apparently, allowed him to ad lib at will).It's supposedly a cop comedy (involving drugs, a kidnapped wife, and a stolen baseball card), and a 'hilarious' send-up of buddy films.

He actually knows his stuff, and must be desperate for money to have agreed to appear in this debacle.As to the sidekick guy, Tracy Morgan... Never heard of him before, and now I know why. Who told this guy he could act? He's so over-the-top that he has to look up to see down. The sad thing is that apparently someone somewhere thinks this guy's funny. If funny means shouting out all your lines with no sense of the scene or what's supposed to be going on around you, then maybe they're right.

Aside from Bruce Willis going the Charles Bronson route in action films (an old man in Death Wish!), it did not look funny and Tracy Morgan is not funny!  No wonder this film came and went so fast!  When I tell people about this film they say ""what?""  I guess that says it all.You can tell a very bad film from the opening.  This film just opens up into the cops lives on the job and expect you to relate to them and to already like them.  They don't tell us their names, rank, who they are or why they are.  The director expects us to know all of this, or he just figured since it's Tracy Morgan and Bruce Willis - that is all that we need to know!  THis film had a poor opening.Like the Hangover II, nothing was funny except maybe one little joke and all I did was chuckle to that.  The directing was horrible.  The plot was horrible.  The story was foolish.  The srcipt must have been written by someone's family member who who thought that they had talent and the producers let them write a script to get a credit!  This was a very, very poor effort.  I really cannot understand how eaither principle could recite their lines and think that it was funny.  Maybe it was the4 style of the director that threw it off?  Mabye it was the actors?  Maybe everyone?Tracye Morgan is acting stupid throughout the film, but acting stupid is not funny, funny is funny!  I know that people work for a paycheck, but I do not see how these guys saw this as funny as they were filming.  This film was a disgrace as each scene that was clearly trying to beat you over the head with ""funny"" was dull and quite embarassing.  I just cannot understand how this type of ""movie-making"" is accepted in this day and age when most films are excellently done.  I really cannot understand this.  Was this film designed to ruin careers?Aside from this empty film, the plot involves Bruce Willis' character needing to pay for his daughter's wedding (his duahgter looks too young to marry) which cost's about $50K.  He does not want his ex-wife's rich new husband to pay for it so he decides to pawn one of his baseball cards worth about $80K.  Sounds very interesting huh?  Of course before this exciting plot broke loose, we had no itdea the film was heading in this direction and once it did, we did not think that this would be it, but it was.Willis get's the card stolen in a robbery and spends the rest of the film trying to find it after getting suspended from the force without pay.  Some how he finds the guy who has the card - a drug dealing Mexican gang leader who has a baseball collection in his hideout!  He asks Willis and Morgan to get something that he is missing and he will give them the card back.  They could have just taken and sold what they had to get for the guy to get the money!  This script must have been wrtten by the producer's young son.  Note to Hollywood producers - stop trying to hook your no-talent family up with good jobs in films just because they are a part of your people group!  Just because they follow the same customs as you do does not make them talented!This film is not clever, not funny, full of cliches, very weak story and is just about as horrible as it comes.  The ONLY good thing about this was the picture quality.  I can even say that the editor was not great either!  Add to this an unrealistic NYC complete with ""Hollywood hispanics"" which are the kind out in Los Angeles in race and fashion, makes for pure fantsy.  I know the guys were Mexicans and other related peoples, but even when they are in NYC they do not dress, talk and act like they are in L.A.

1300274,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B002ZG96ZC,Craig Whittle,"[1, 2]","COP OUTSTARRING: Bruce Willis, Tracy Morgan, Guillermo Diaz, Sean William Scott, Ana de la Reguera, Kevin Pollak, Adam Brody, Jason Lee, Rashida Jones, Cory Fernandez, Sean Cullen and Michelle TrachtenbergWRITTEN BY: Robb Cullen and Mark CullenDIRECTED BY: Kevin SmithRated: RGenre: Action / ComedyRelease Date: 26 February 2010Review Date: 23 September 2010I know Cop Out could have been better, but I enjoyed it. Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan is about as odd a match as you can find; but, man did they mesh terrifically! Morgan's off the wall and insanely spastic comedy, up against Willis's mug, tough-guy cop routine was a riot!Up until Cop Out, I had despised Tracy Morgan in everything I had ever seen him in. He just got on my nerves. I don't know if it's his new hit show 30 Rock (I haven't seen it yet) or what; but the guy has turned over a new leaf and had me rolling with laughter. I loved him in Death at a Funeral as well.Willis plays Jimmy Monroe and Morgan plays Paul Hodges. They're New York detectives who have been partners for 9 years, which Paul is more than grateful for, and seems to leave a sour taste in Jimmy's mouth.Jimmy's daughter is to be married and he can't afford to pay for her elaborate wedding and that just kills him; especially considering his ex-wife's new hubby (Jason Lee) has more than enough dough to cough up, and takes great pleasure in rubbing that in Jimmy's face.After they get into trouble with their Captain (which is almost a requirement in this genre) they're put on suspension without pay. Desperate for cash, Jimmy's pride gets the better of him, and he decides to sell a very valuable baseball card left to him by his father.However, when Jimmy and Paul head down to the card shop, they get the crap kicked out of them, and the card stolen at gunpoint. To make matters worse, they find themselves in the middle of a very nasty situation involving gun toting gangstas, kidnapping, drug smuggling, and a run in with none other than Sean William Scott.Cop Out being directed by Kevin Smith, you know you're in for a rude awakening; and if you don't, then I'm warning you now: lots of childish jokes involving fecal matter and sexual innuendos. But somehow when Bruce Willis is involved, they seem more acceptable and humorous, rather than vulgar and immature. The film wasn't written by Kevin Smith, and for that it suffers in creativity a great deal. It's Morgan and Willis who keep it fresh and entertaining.I loved the scenes of the two of them ripping on each other, and the ones where they team up against other cops in their precinct in verbal standoffs. My favorite would be where they pretended to call one another while sitting right next to each other, having a verbally abusive conversation about the two cops standing directly in front of them. And I have to mention the opening of the film. Tracy Morgan was hilarious, and as this was changed from the original screenplay, whoever's idea this was, deserves a gold star! Funny, funny stuff!Cop Out is a throwback to the classic buddy-cop flicks of the 80s like Lethal Weapon and 48 Hours. Is it in the same league as those? No; but it's in a new league of grotesquely funny, all on its own.",4,Cop Out Review,1287014400,"10 14, 2010",2010,3204,"['COP', 'OUTSTARRING', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'Guillermo', 'Diaz', 'Sean', 'William', 'Scott', 'Ana', 'de', 'la', 'Reguera', 'Kevin', 'Pollak', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Rashida', 'Jones', 'Cory', 'Fernandez', 'Sean', 'Cullen', 'Michelle', 'TrachtenbergWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Robb', 'Cullen', 'Mark', 'CullenDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Kevin', 'SmithRated', 'RGenre', 'Action', '/', 'ComedyRelease', 'Date', '26', 'February', '2010Review', 'Date', '23', 'September', '2010I', 'know', 'Cop', 'Out', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'enjoyed', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'odd', 'match', 'can', 'find', 'man', 'did', 'mesh', 'terrifically', 'Morgan', 'off', 'wall', 'insanely', 'spastic', 'comedy', 'up', 'Willis', 'mug', 'tough-guy', 'cop', 'routine', 'was', 'riot', 'Cop', 'Out', 'had', 'despised', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'everything', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'just', 'got', 'nerves', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'new', 'hit', 'show', '30', 'Rock', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'what', 'guy', 'turned', 'over', 'new', 'leaf', 'had', 'rolling', 'laughter', 'loved', 'Death', 'Funeral', 'well.Willis', 'Jimmy', 'Monroe', 'Morgan', 'Paul', 'Hodges', ""'re"", 'New', 'York', 'detectives', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'partners', '9', 'years', 'Paul', 'more', 'grateful', 'leave', 'sour', 'taste', 'Jimmy', 'mouth.Jimmy', 'daughter', 'be', 'married', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'pay', 'elaborate', 'wedding', 'just', 'especially', 'considering', 'ex-wife', 'new', 'hubby', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'more', 'enough', 'cough', 'up', 'great', 'pleasure', 'rubbing', 'Jimmy', 'face.After', 'get', 'trouble', 'Captain', 'almost', 'requirement', 'genre', ""'re"", 'put', 'suspension', 'pay', 'Desperate', 'cash', 'Jimmy', 'pride', 'better', 'sell', 'very', 'valuable', 'baseball', 'card', 'left', 'father.However', 'when', 'Jimmy', 'Paul', 'head', 'card', 'shop', 'get', 'crap', 'kicked', 'card', 'stolen', 'gunpoint', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'find', 'middle', 'very', 'nasty', 'situation', 'involving', 'gun', 'toting', 'gangstas', 'kidnapping', 'drug', 'smuggling', 'run', 'none', 'other', 'Sean', 'William', 'Scott.Cop', 'Out', 'being', 'directed', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'know', ""'re"", 'rude', 'awakening', 'do', ""n't"", 'then', ""'m"", 'warning', 'now', 'lots', 'childish', 'jokes', 'involving', 'fecal', 'matter', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'somehow', 'when', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'involved', 'seem', 'more', 'acceptable', 'humorous', 'rather', 'vulgar', 'immature', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'written', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'creativity', 'great', 'deal', 'Morgan', 'Willis', 'who', 'keep', 'fresh', 'entertaining.I', 'loved', 'scenes', 'two', 'ripping', 'other', 'ones', 'where', 'team', 'up', 'other', 'cops', 'precinct', 'verbal', 'standoffs', 'favorite', 'would', 'be', 'where', 'pretended', 'call', 'one', 'sitting', 'right', 'next', 'other', 'having', 'verbally', 'abusive', 'conversation', 'two', 'cops', 'standing', 'directly', 'front', 'have', 'mention', 'opening', 'film', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'was', 'hilarious', 'was', 'changed', 'original', 'screenplay', 'whoever', 'idea', 'was', 'gold', 'star', 'Funny', 'funny', 'stuff', 'Cop', 'Out', 'throwback', 'classic', 'buddy-cop', 'flicks', '80s', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', '48', 'Hours', 'same', 'league', 'No', 'new', 'league', 'grotesquely', 'funny', 'own']",N/A
1300275,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B002ZG96ZC,C. Sawin,"[40, 55]","To tell the truth, I wasn't looking forward to this film at all. I'm a pretty big fan of most of Kevin Smith's work, but he didn't write the film. It could be argued that he did write Jersey Girl and that could be considered a bomb, but his films usually average about $25-$30 million anyway. A Kevin Smith film isn't really about bringing in a large amount of money at the box office. His charm is in his writing, especially the dialogue and interaction between characters. There's a very specific audience his films will appeal to and none of them have really branched away from that. But him not writing this one made me think, ""Eh. Not sure what that'll be like since he didn't write it."" When it comes to Bruce Willis, I've never talked to anyone who dislikes him entirely. There always seems to be at least one of his films everybody enjoys. Die Hard, The Fifth Element, and Sin City are just a few off the top of my head. The real buzzkiller for me though was Tracy Morgan. He's just never been funny to me. He was beyond lame on Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock has never been able to hold my attention for very long. Not to mention all the trailers for Cop Out didn't make me laugh. Thankfully though, first impressions can be so very wrong.One of Cop Out's biggest charms is that it feels like a buddy cop comedy you've seen before, but have forgotten how much you enjoy it. The film feels similar to a 48 Hrs or Beverly Hills Cop film. Bulletproof is also a good example. Cop Out is pretty much what you expect when it comes to roles Bruce Willis chooses as it's pretty much no different than his role as John McClane on the surface, but he's a lot funnier this time around. As far as Tracy Morgan goes, the funniest thing I could remember him saying was his one line in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (""Man... I don't know what the f--- you just said, Little Kid, but you're special man, you reached out, and you touched a brother's heart."") until this film. He was downright hilarious at times. The only person who was funnier than Morgan was Seann William Scott who stole every scene he was in. Even though Kevin Smith didn't pen the script this time around, it still feels like a Kevin Smith film. It could be due to the fact that Jason Lee has a small role in the film, but I like to think it's because Cop Out offers the same kind of comedy you'd find in a Kevin Smith film with a bit more action. It also took me forever to place Scarface from Half Baked as Poh Boy.Cop Out is surprisingly funny and incredibly entertaining. Give this film a chance even if the trailers may not be doing anything for you. I felt the same way and wound up thoroughly enjoying the film. After a long, stressful day at work, an R-rated comedy with a lot of laughs is one of the best ways to relax and this film offers just that. It's a great film to go into with no expectations other than to just have a good time. As long as you don't run out of the theater, you should catch the part in the credits. This might just be the funniest film released in 2010 thus far. Be sure to check it out.

Smith has an affinity for the genre notablythe ""Lethal Weapon"" flicks which ""Cop Out"" is very reminiscent of.  Defying his middle-age, Bruce Willis seems energized here.  Smith did a cameo in ""Live Free or Die Hard"" so there's probably mutual admiration going on between he and Willis.  Another credit to the flick is dynamic rapport between Willis and Tracy Morgan kind of like old school meets new school.  Seann William Scott is also terrific as an annoying burglar who gets under Morgan's skin.

It was as if they were starring in two different movies edited together.  One was a running monologue of stale jokes; the other wanted to be an actual cop film complete with a case to solve, the obligatory car chase, shootouts, and several executions thrown in for good measure!

When this film was first announced I said to myself, ""well he found a project to do with Bruce Willis since they became buddies on Die Hard 4"". So I was excited about the film and even more so when I heard Jason Lee was going to be in it. So time went by as I waited for more info on the film when finally I heard something. That something was not really what I wanted to hear, Kevin Smith was only directing and not writing, so I was a little worried about that but hey if Kevin is directing it then I had to have it.The story follows two detectives who ""don't play by the rules"" [yes I know we have seen it before] and cause a case to go no where. This of course like every good buddy cop flick causes them to be suspended without pay. Now the big thing there is Bruce's character has a daughter that is getting married so he has to sell a priceless baseball card to get the money for it. He has to do this as to not allow her step father [played wonderfully by Jason Lee] to pay for his daughter's wedding. So when he goes to sell the card a robbery occurs in which his card is stolen, so basically the whole movie is about them trying to get that card back. The poor guy goes through all kinds of things and all he wanted was his card back.Now I will admit that this film is not the classic it could have been, nothing against the writers but I would have liked to see this with Kevin writing as well as directing. Still there are laughs to be had and like a lot of reviews out there have said a lot come form Seann William Scott. Now I can see were some may be annoyed by his character but I think that is the point, I thought he was hilarious in this film and really added a lot to it. Jason lee is also excellent in this film for the time he is on screen; I love the last scene with him, Tracy Morgan, and Bruce Willis. Speaking of those two they make for an entertaining on screen team but at times it feels flat because the script does not give them much to do at times. The rest of the cast are good in this and do what they can with the script, good thing Kevin Smith was directing.You can tell the look of the film was his as it was shot like one his films; I really wish he could have written this but oh well. The film is not bad in my opinion and was actually better than I was expecting it to be. It may start a little slow but once it gets going the film really does get better and I would actually recommend the film. At least give it a try as a rental because depending on your sense of humor you may love this film. I think Kevin did a great job with the first film he did not write; hopefully he gets the chance to do this once again. The laughs are good if you like the humor in this film and the action is pretty good as well, as far as kinda spoofing buddy cop films this is a good one.",3,"NOT BAD, BETTER THAN EXPECTED",1279670400,"07 21, 2010",2010,2960,"['COP', 'OUTNow', 'know', 'know', 'am', 'huge', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'fan', 'will', 'buy', 'anything', 'associated', 'so', 'naturally', 'know', 'had', 'have', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'announced', 'said', 'myself', 'well', 'found', 'project', 'do', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'became', 'buddies', 'Die', 'Hard', '4', 'was', 'excited', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'heard', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'time', 'went', 'waited', 'more', 'info', 'film', 'when', 'finally', 'heard', 'something', 'something', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'what', 'wanted', 'hear', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'was', 'only', 'directing', 'not', 'writing', 'was', 'little', 'worried', 'hey', 'Kevin', 'directing', 'then', 'had', 'have', 'it.The', 'story', 'two', 'detectives', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'rules', '[', 'yes', 'know', 'have', 'seen', ']', 'cause', 'case', 'go', 'where', 'course', 'good', 'buddy', 'cop', 'flick', 'be', 'suspended', 'pay', 'Now', 'big', 'thing', 'Bruce', 'character', 'daughter', 'getting', 'married', 'sell', 'priceless', 'baseball', 'card', 'get', 'money', 'do', 'not', 'allow', 'step', 'father', '[', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Jason', 'Lee', ']', 'pay', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'So', 'when', 'sell', 'card', 'robbery', 'occurs', 'card', 'stolen', 'so', 'basically', 'whole', 'movie', 'trying', 'get', 'card', 'back', 'poor', 'guy', 'kinds', 'things', 'wanted', 'was', 'card', 'back.Now', 'will', 'admit', 'film', 'not', 'classic', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'nothing', 'writers', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'Kevin', 'writing', 'as', 'well', 'directing', 'Still', 'are', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'lot', 'reviews', 'there', 'have', 'said', 'lot', 'come', 'form', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'Now', 'can', 'see', 'were', 'may', 'be', 'annoyed', 'character', 'think', 'point', 'thought', 'was', 'hilarious', 'film', 'really', 'added', 'lot', 'Jason', 'lee', 'also', 'excellent', 'film', 'time', 'screen', 'love', 'last', 'scene', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Speaking', 'two', 'make', 'entertaining', 'screen', 'team', 'times', 'flat', 'script', 'not', 'give', 'much', 'do', 'times', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'good', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'script', 'good', 'thing', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'was', 'directing.You', 'can', 'tell', 'look', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'shot', 'one', 'films', 'really', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'written', 'oh', 'well', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'opinion', 'was', 'actually', 'better', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'may', 'start', 'little', 'slow', 'once', 'going', 'film', 'really', 'get', 'better', 'would', 'actually', 'recommend', 'film', 'least', 'give', 'try', 'rental', 'depending', 'sense', 'humor', 'may', 'love', 'film', 'think', 'Kevin', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'first', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'write', 'hopefully', 'chance', 'do', 'once', 'again', 'laughs', 'are', 'good', 'like', 'humor', 'film', 'action', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'far', 'kinda', 'spoofing', 'buddy', 'cop', 'films', 'good', 'one']",N/A

Wilkerson,"[15, 22]","After being suspended from the police force, Jimmy Monroe (Bruce Willis) finds out that his daughter's wedding is going to cost $40,000, and to show up her step father (Jason Lee) he's going to have to foot the bill. To pay for the wedding, Jimmy pulls out an old rare baseball card he's had since he was a kid worth $82,000 and prepares to pawn it. But when the pawn shop he's trying to sell it to gets robbed, he enlists the help of his partner, Paul Hodges (Tracy Morgan) to help retrieve the card. In their efforts to hunt down Jimmy's rare baseball card, though, they get more than they bargained for as they find themselves in the midst of the drug dealing underworld.Kevin Smith is not really known for being a great visual director, quite the opposite, while his dialogue might get accolades his visual style is usually considered by many critics to be abysmal. With a writing style that a critic has described as ""David Mamet meets Howard Stern"" Smith would most likely be called upon to write or rewrite movies as he has done for Coyote Ugly, Live Free or Die Hard, and even a few drafts of the ill-fated Superman Lives, as well as comic books from Spider-Man and Daredevil to Batman. Picking Smith to direct a movie that he hasn't written seemed unthinkable. Then in 2007, Smith directed the pilot episode of Reaper and committed his best work as a director, and that was for a project he did not write. Having been given opportunities to direct other projects for years, Smith finally took the opportunity to direct a script that's been waiting on Hollywood's Black List, a list that compiles the best unproduced screenplays in Hollywood.Kevin Smith directs Cop Out as an ode to the comedy buddy cop films of the 80's, an homage of films such as 48 Hours and Beverly Hills Cop. To this end Kevin Smith even enlisted the help of composer Harold Faltermeyer, best known for writing The Heat is On and Axel F the theme from Beverly Hills Cop. In tone and visual style, Smith accomplishes one of his best directing jobs yet. He works his way adequately around an action sequence, even if not impressively. But all said and done, you don't go into a Kevin Smith film for the visual style, but here you get more than you expect in that department.The acting in Cop Out is better than in some of Kevin Smith's earlier films thanks to an A-list cast. Typically, I can't say that I'm a fan of Tracy Morgan outside 30Rock, but here he adequately plays the majority of the role without overacting it as normally is the case. Of course, that's not always the case. Bruce Willis does well as normal, but at times seems a bit stiff in his acting and delivery. The real star of this film is Sean William Scott who effectively steals every scene he's in. You can really tell he's having a blast every time you see him on the screen.The problem with Cop Out is that it's missing something. It feels generic, and forgettable. At times the dialogue can be stilted and the plot a little trite. It doesn't really feel like a Kevin Smith film, and that's what I missed the most. Had Kevin Smith done a rewrite on the script it would have been a much better film, but what came out is a movie that feels like a straight to DVD movie in slightly better wrapping.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, I laughed, I felt for the characters I got into. Unfortunately there was something missing that I felt this movie deserved. Hopefully next time Smith will use his own voice to craft his next movie and make a product. Until then I'll still enjoy this movie for what it is: a funny nostalgic romp through 80's cop comedy.3.5/5",3,Cop Out,1272499200,"04 29, 2010",2010,3608,"['being', 'suspended', 'police', 'force', 'Jimmy', 'Monroe', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'out', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'going', 'cost', '40,000', 'show', 'up', 'step', 'father', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'going', 'have', 'foot', 'bill', 'pay', 'wedding', 'Jimmy', 'out', 'old', 'rare', 'baseball', 'card', 'had', 'was', 'kid', 'worth', '82,000', 'prepares', 'pawn', 'when', 'pawn', 'shop', 'trying', 'sell', 'robbed', 'help', 'partner', 'Paul', 'Hodges', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'help', 'retrieve', 'card', 'efforts', 'hunt', 'down', 'Jimmy', 'rare', 'baseball', 'card', 'though', 'get', 'more', 'bargained', 'find', 'midst', 'drug', 'dealing', 'underworld.Kevin', 'Smith', 'not', 'really', 'known', 'being', 'great', 'visual', 'director', 'quite', 'opposite', 'dialogue', 'might', 'get', 'visual', 'style', 'usually', 'considered', 'many', 'critics', 'be', 'abysmal', 'writing', 'style', 'critic', 'described', 'David', 'Mamet', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'Smith', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'called', 'write', 'rewrite', 'movies', 'done', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'Live', 'Free', 'Die', 'Hard', 'even', 'few', 'drafts', 'ill-fated', 'Superman', 'as', 'well', 'comic', 'books', 'Spider-Man', 'Daredevil', 'Batman', 'Picking', 'Smith', 'direct', 'movie', ""n't"", 'written', 'seemed', 'unthinkable', 'Then', '2007', 'Smith', 'directed', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Reaper', 'committed', 'best', 'work', 'director', 'was', 'project', 'did', 'not', 'write', 'Having', 'been', 'given', 'opportunities', 'direct', 'other', 'projects', 'years', 'Smith', 'finally', 'took', 'opportunity', 'direct', 'script', 'been', 'waiting', 'Hollywood', 'Black', 'List', 'list', 'best', 'unproduced', 'screenplays', 'Hollywood.Kevin', 'Smith', 'Cop', 'Out', 'ode', 'comedy', 'buddy', 'cop', 'films', '80', 'homage', 'films', 'such', '48', 'Hours', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Cop', 'end', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'even', 'enlisted', 'help', 'composer', 'Harold', 'Faltermeyer', 'best', 'known', 'writing', 'Heat', 'Axel', 'F', 'theme', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Cop', 'tone', 'visual', 'style', 'Smith', 'one', 'best', 'directing', 'jobs', 'yet', 'way', 'adequately', 'action', 'sequence', 'even', 'not', 'impressively', 'said', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'film', 'visual', 'style', 'here', 'get', 'more', 'expect', 'department.The', 'acting', 'Cop', 'Out', 'better', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'earlier', 'films', 'thanks', 'A-list', 'cast', 'Typically', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', '30Rock', 'here', 'adequately', 'majority', 'role', 'overacting', 'normally', 'case', 'course', 'not', 'always', 'case', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'well', 'normal', 'times', 'bit', 'stiff', 'acting', 'delivery', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'Sean', 'William', 'Scott', 'who', 'effectively', 'scene', 'can', 'really', 'tell', 'having', 'blast', 'time', 'see', 'screen.The', 'problem', 'Cop', 'Out', 'missing', 'something', 'generic', 'forgettable', 'times', 'dialogue', 'can', 'be', 'stilted', 'plot', 'little', 'trite', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'film', 'what', 'missed', 'most', 'Had', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'done', 'rewrite', 'script', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'what', 'came', 'out', 'movie', 'straight', 'DVD', 'movie', 'slightly', 'better', 'wrapping.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'enjoyed', 'laughed', 'felt', 'characters', 'got', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'something', 'missing', 'felt', 'movie', 'deserved', 'Hopefully', 'next', 'time', 'Smith', 'will', 'use', 'own', 'voice', 'craft', 'next', 'movie', 'make', 'product', 'then', ""'ll"", 'still', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'what', 'funny', 'nostalgic', 'romp', '80', 'cop', 'comedy.3.5/5']",N/A

Although he tried to give it his best shot, he was funny in some scenes. Bruce plays the serious guy to Tracy Morgan's outrageous comedy.The main problem with ""Cop Out"" is that it was produced very sloppily. The movie moves around in all different directions, the plot takes a lot of turns and along the way the ultimate story gets convoluted and watered down. Some of the movie seems like a comedy and then just a silly over the top farce, some of the it is an action and then a buddy comedy and even a suspense. But the overall crutch of the movie is incredibly shoddy because there was little-to-no character development.I liked the way the movie opened. Without a lot of music and boring credits. The movie just began. I guess that's how new movies are made in twenty ten.The soundtrack is absolutely hideous.

In what is essentially a send-up ofBrooklyn's Finest, Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan do theLethal Weapon/Stakeoutroutine. Morgan is addicted to movie one-liners. Willis is more hard-headed, or should we say thick-skulled.After a bust goes way down South, Willis and Morgan are suspended for thirty days without pay. Willis, whose daughter's wedding is approaching, needs to raise some quick cash, and so decides to part with his prized mint condition Topps 1951 # 1 baseball card, featuring Andy Pafko of the Brooklyn Dodgers. (I find myself wondering how many people who see this movie will be surprised to discover that the DODGERS BELONG IN BROOKLYN!!!)Nothing goes right. Just as he's selling the Pafko (estimated to fetch around $80,000), the sports memorabilia store gets robbed. Willis is jumped, the Pafko disappears. Morgan, meanwhile is on the phone yukking it up with his sexy wife who he suspects of cheating on him, and misses the whole thing.The rest of the movie becomes an action-filled scavenger hunt for the Pafko, which leads Willis and Morgan right into the heart ofv a Mexican drug pipeline.This is a good light and breezy popcorn and soda movie. The biggest criticisms I have of COP OUT are:(1) Morgan's paranoia about his wife is a stupid subplot. Ignore it.(2) Willis and Morgan have very little ""Brooklyn"" in them but way too much ""Los Angeles.""(3) The same goes for the Mexican drug gang.Essentially, COP OUT never tastes the street; the characters are isolated from their surroundings, just like LAPD cruisecar boys. Real Brooklyn cops would be organically hooked in to the neighborhood. In real life, Willis would never have a shoot-'em-up over the Pafko; the word would go out that he needed the Pafko to pay for his daughter's wedding, and the Pafko would reappear, maybe with a string of conditions, but he'd have the Pafko. Whoever wrote this was NOT from Brooklyn.On the Plus side:(1)  The action is excellent.(2)  The kommanderving between Willis and Morgan is funny.(3)  Willis one-ups his poisonous ex-wife's rich (LA-type) husband who wants to ruin his life by paying for the wedding.(4)  The Brooklyn Dodgers are at the heart of the movie.Maow down on the microwaveable popcorn, run yourself a soda IV, watch the movie and forget your troubles for a while.",4,Here's to Andy Pafko!

But this film might as well have been written by Smith, who for my money is one of the most ham-handed, overrated writer/directors out there. This guy is in his 40s but poop jokes are still his forte; yes, he's a filmmaking genius! At least he isn't trying to do drama again here like the execrable Chasing Amy. But he is trying to do a buddy comedy and it exposes his rather mediocre directing skills as well. Every shot here is a weak copy---not an ""o-maj""---of some other cop flick, but the only evident parody is self-parody. The guy still seems like he just got out of film school.Willis smirks his way through, as usual, and despite trying to be a spoof of the genre Cop Out also tries to be a buddy flick and fails rather badly. One of the few highlights was Scott, funnier than usual; the scene with him in the back of the car has some good laughs. But I still think Clerks and perhaps Dogma are the only things worth watching by Smith. No offense to his many worshippers, but dang, when I watch any movie by a real director and a real writer and then one of Smith's, I feel like he's become popular by proving that any Beavis with a pen and a camera can make a movie, going for the cheapest laughs and faux melodrama.

1300310,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002ZG96ZC,Mark Turner,"[2, 5]","Let me state up front that I am a fan of Kevin Smith movies. With the exception of one (ZACK AND MIRI MAKE A PORNO) I've found his films to be interesting, controversial, entertaining and enjoyable. Now we have two in a row that fall into the category of movies to avoid at all costs. And while I wasn't a fan of ZACK AND MIRI, I'd watch it again before watching COP OUT.COP OUT is basically the formula buddy cop movie. Bruce Willis plays Jimmy Monroe, the stoic more serious member of the duo. Tracy Morgan plays Paul Hodges, the loud mouthed humorous one (or at least he's supposed to be) who talks non-stop whenever the camera hits him. The film opens with the duo interrogating a suspect who they then turn into a snitch.Morgan and Willis go on stake out with Morgan in a cell phone suit standing on the sidewalk in front of a store the man works in while they wait for his contact, a drug dealer and supplier. Spotted, the dealer shoots the snitch and gets away but not before Morgan steals a kids bicycle to chase him down and Willis gets slightly hit by a car as the bad guy gets away. In turn for their heroic efforts (and due to the footage of Morgan stealing the bike appearing on youtube), the pair are put on suspension for 30 days.This is a problem for Willis whose daughter is about to get married and whose marriage runs a tab of just over $48,000. Step dad Roy (Jason Lee) volunteers to pay but that's all due to a one upsmanship contest between dad and step dad. To pay for the wedding, Willis decides to part with a rare baseball card he's had for years worth $82,000. But while passing it to a dealer in his store, the place is held up and the card loss. Now the pair goes on a hunt for the thieves who took the card.The drug dealers are still out and about as well. When the drug lord Poh Boy's Mercedes is stolen, he kills the man responsible for handling the car and offers a bounty for anyone who finds it. What are the odds that these two divergent paths will cross somewhere down the line. Sure they will.Picking up the thief who stole the card, Willis and Morgan end up confronting Poh Boy, an avid collector who has the card now. He offers to give them the card if they locate his Mercedes. But there's something special in the Mercedes that the two police detectives come across.The film tries far too hard for laughs and ends up delivering none. The funniest moments we see here are the ones we all were able to see in the trailer for this film and even those aren't all that funny. And while Sean William Scott got quite a bit of screen time in that trailer, his part here is minor.The entire time I was watching this movie I found myself wanting to push the fast forward button to get to a part where something happens. I kept wondering is this supposed to be a comedy because I haven't laughed once. Then I thought is it a cop movie, but the plot was so thin that I didn't think it was that either. So it must have been a buddy cop film...except that there was absolutely no chemistry between Morgan and Willis. This is odd because Willis seems to find chemistry with almost any actor.Director Smith is noted for his dialogue in his films. But since this is his first movie where he wasn't responsible for the script I guess I can't blame him for the lame dialogue here. Nor can I blame him for the slapdash story that never gets the viewer involved or interested. I found myself not even caring about a side story of Morgan thinking his wife was cheating on him and his paranoia about it.In the film STARDUST MEMORIES, Woody Allen played a film director of comedies who makes a serious film that no one likes.

El-Hewie""","[8, 14]","In one year, Brooklyn alone gave birth to the four hits: Cop Out, Brooklyn's Finest, Armored, and Surrogates, two of which starring Bruce Willis.  In Cop Out, Willis regained his vigor and youthfulness, compared to his drained and wasted appearance in Surrogates.  Tracy Morgan's role took away the boredom from Willis' familiar and predictable style of acting.Morgan's untainted performance made his comedy refreshing. His charismatic nature and great sociability enriched the failing morale of the movie industry. Getting Morgan to uplift the seasoned Willis and embarking on the richness of Brooklyn's diverse culture was wiser than Travolta's pick of Robin Williams (in Old Dogs) or Paris (From Paris with Love)to regain an edge. You would hope that John McCain have learned how to pick his running mate before naming Palin.Like Brooklyn's Finest, Cup Out deals with the [unfine] life of New York cops. The two partners, each has his marital problems, low pay, and inability to stay close to home. The divorced one must find a way to pay for his daughter's wedding.  A Sport's memorabilia was his only hope out of his financial crisis.  Selling his precious piece of memorabilia got him in an O.J.-like armored rubbery. The movie dwells on how police-victim would retrieve his stolen memorabilia by tracing the robber to the Mexican gangs.The choice of the Mexican gangster was superb. The two police couple must make a deal with the Mexican Gang leader in order to retrieve their stolen property. In such arrangement, suspicion, murder, and betrayal are the rules of the game. Even though the two cops retrieved the stolen precious card, it was damaged beyond hope.The greatest entertainment in the movie were the richness and innovation of Tracy Morgan in acting uninhibited with real life content; the Mexican boys' exquisite ability to play the snappy and sharp anger that characterized the street gang; and the Italian house lady who outmatched the two cops in protecting her Italian made furniture and carpet.  All was displayed on the magnificent highways and landscape of the Big Apple and the never ending humor of walking into a police- ridden workplace.",5,Viva Brooklyn!,1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,2168,"['one', 'year', 'Brooklyn', 'alone', 'gave', 'birth', 'four', 'hits', 'Cop', 'Out', 'Brooklyn', 'Finest', 'Armored', 'Surrogates', 'two', 'starring', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Cop', 'Out', 'Willis', 'regained', 'vigor', 'youthfulness', 'compared', 'drained', 'wasted', 'appearance', 'Surrogates', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'role', 'took', 'away', 'boredom', 'Willis', 'familiar', 'predictable', 'style', 'acting.Morgan', 'untainted', 'performance', 'made', 'comedy', 'refreshing', 'charismatic', 'nature', 'great', 'sociability', 'enriched', 'failing', 'morale', 'movie', 'industry', 'Getting', 'Morgan', 'uplift', 'seasoned', 'Willis', 'embarking', 'richness', 'Brooklyn', 'diverse', 'culture', 'was', 'wiser', 'Travolta', 'pick', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Old', 'Dogs', 'Paris', 'Paris', 'Love', 'regain', 'edge', 'would', 'hope', 'John', 'McCain', 'have', 'learned', 'how', 'pick', 'running', 'mate', 'naming', 'Palin.Like', 'Brooklyn', 'Finest', 'Cup', 'Out', 'deals', '[', 'unfine', ']', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'cops', 'two', 'partners', 'marital', 'problems', 'low', 'pay', 'inability', 'stay', 'close', 'home', 'divorced', 'one', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'pay', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'Sport', 'memorabilia', 'was', 'only', 'hope', 'financial', 'crisis', 'Selling', 'precious', 'piece', 'memorabilia', 'got', 'O.J.-like', 'armored', 'rubbery', 'movie', 'how', 'police-victim', 'would', 'retrieve', 'stolen', 'memorabilia', 'tracing', 'robber', 'Mexican', 'gangs.The', 'choice', 'Mexican', 'gangster', 'was', 'superb', 'two', 'police', 'couple', 'must', 'make', 'deal', 'Mexican', 'Gang', 'leader', 'order', 'retrieve', 'stolen', 'property', 'such', 'arrangement', 'suspicion', 'murder', 'betrayal', 'are', 'rules', 'game', 'Even', 'two', 'cops', 'retrieved', 'stolen', 'precious', 'card', 'was', 'damaged', 'hope.The', 'greatest', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'were', 'richness', 'innovation', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'acting', 'uninhibited', 'real', 'life', 'content', 'Mexican', 'boys', 'exquisite', 'ability', 'play', 'snappy', 'sharp', 'anger', 'characterized', 'street', 'gang', 'Italian', 'house', 'lady', 'who', 'outmatched', 'two', 'cops', 'protecting', 'Italian', 'made', 'furniture', 'carpet', 'was', 'displayed', 'magnificent', 'highways', 'landscape', 'Big', 'Apple', 'never', 'ending', 'humor', 'walking', 'police-', 'ridden', 'workplace']",N/A

This movie keeps you laughing for most of the journey and even has some good fighting sequences.I won't give away too much of the story, but you have Paul in a normal marriage and Jimmy trying to find a way to pay for his daughters marriage. The story is simple, but with a comedy you don't need a super complex story, and I found it compelling enough. Bruce and Tracy make the quarks of their characters even more outrageous and funny, and the acting is great.The soundtrack just has some good songs during the course of it, but you're not really paying attention to the music, but laughing instead.

From Tracy quoting movies in an interrogation while wielding a gun to a 11 year old car thief with a potty mouth and bad attitude. However CopOut is not that far out of place from other films made in recent years. CopOut is a police version of a movie like say the hangover films.Meaning it is a completely ridiculous plot with a bunch of humor but really goes nowhere and i think that was the point. People who are looking for the typical Bruce films with the no crap cop who is tough as nails then go with Die Hard.The humor in the film had me laughing pretty hard, that combined with Bruce and his dry humor earned this movie an extra star. Bruce and Tracy do a good job going off of each other on the screen. But the plot in the film is seriously flawed and will leave you unimpressed. Along with the extremely sad acting from the primary bad guy. The acting from that guy was so bad it actually made me feel awkward watching as he forced the words out in a crappy accent.This film is perfect for those who just want to laugh and don't care about the plot or some bad acting by a few characters. Bruce holds most of the film together and Tracy does help too but Bruce certainly carried this film.Overall the film had me laughing really hard a lot and Bruce was hilarious so the film gets 3 out of 5 stars.

1300330,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B002ZG96ZC,Robert Badgley,"[2, 3]","Cop Out(Feb/10)is,from beginning to end,a total yawnfest.Now I'll tell you what I really think.This is director Kevin Smith's film and the blame squarely rests on his and the script writers shoulders.They have Bruce Willis to work with for gosh sakes,how hard could it be?Mind you Robert Swentke completely blew it with a stellar cast which included Willis in RED,so it does happen.What does come across right away as the film is unfolding is the lack of chemistry between Willis and his co star Tracy Morgan.Some one tell me what it is with SNL alumni?A comedian or comedienne gets a bit of a following on the show,becomes a popular figure and suddenly Hollywood is courting them for film work,as if they're already bona fide stars.And many of the newer crop of comedy actors from SNL desperately NEED real acting skills and time to hone them.Tracy Morgan is without question,one of them.The plot involves Willis and Morgan as two NYC cops.Willis' daughter is getting married and he hasn't enough cash.So when Willis goes to sell a mint baseball card to raise the money he is robbed.Afterwards Willis finds out who stole his card,but as it turns out,that robber has sold the card to a Mexican drug dealer,who now has it.When Willis and Morgan show up at the dealers house an arrangement is made.In exchange for a car the dealer desperately wants,Willis will get his rare card back.They track down the car only to find the girlfriend of a dead rival of the dealer they are ""working' for,in the trunk and very much alive.She is the reason the dealer is after the car as she possesses vital intel on a flash drive she has in her possession.The two guard her but she escapes on Morgan when Willis steps out.She unfortunately walks right into the gangs hands and the dealer has her as a hostage.Now that the cops bargaining chip is gone,Willis decides to enter the gang house to get his card himself,but the gang arrives home ahead of schedule and he gets caught inside.He escapes but only has to re-enter with Morgan to rescue the girl.The dealer stands to the right of the girl with a shot gun to the back of her head.Two shots ring out,as Willis' pierces the dealers head and Morgans goes into the heart.Later examination reveals that Morgans shot went through a vest pocket first,containing Willis' prized card which is now garbage.The film ends at his daughters wedding as Willis has had to let his ex-wife's boyfriend pay for the wedding.But just as both men stand up together as the minister asks who will stand for this bride,Morgan pulls the new hubby back down letting Willis have the honour alone.The film should have ended about 10 minutes previously with some judicious editing.It was a film too far,with a plot too thinly stretched to take on 107 minutes.There is a silly sub plot with Morgan being totally insecure about his wife and her sexual habits when he is not home.Also Seann Scott shows up as the burglar who robs Willis of his card initially.Scott provides the film with a few of its only endearing moments as he mocks Morgan when they first meet.Scott shockingly dies after falling out of a tree,hitting his head on a brick wall(Smith shows us the hit-bad move!).However the dynamic of that moment does not gel with the mood and flow of the film at all.Finally Tracy Morgan's futile attempt at humour,which in his case is mugging severely and over acting with alot of cursing thrown in for good measure,is plain terrible.That Willis and Morgan could ever be partners in real life or not, would have taken an acting feat of herculean proportions to pull off the believability factor.Technically speaking the film is it w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and it is clear and crisp.Extra include the trailer and deleted scenes.All in all a total disappointment from beginning to end.This was  a waste of Willis' time and it showed how far Morgan has yet to go when it comes to anything even approaching acting.His SNL antics are not going to cut it on film with a ""performance"" like this.Give the film a wide pass.",2,What a cop out this movie is-,1341619200,"07 7,

This laid back humor is pretty much daily fare spread over more intense events in a fun script. Cops get in trouble, are laid off. Has to pay for daughters wedding. Get $. Is robbed trying to sell the perfect baseball card. Its just one set up for laughs after another. Bruce Willis can do a very powerful subtle humor and keeps it there. Tracey plays the full house of mock emotions  ingratiating - aggravated. This is real humor. Everyone is in good character form. Guillermo Diaz & de la Raguera are really perfect. Willis & Morgan have the most intensity of humor and crisp characters as do the villains. Luckily there are only 2 boring typical behaviour guys the other cop-types Pollack & Brody. They are used as straightmen. Sean Scott is sort of thrown in as extra plot and is really memorable easiest take away character from the film. Every one else does get to shine.

We went and were happy we did. Is it the very best cop buddy movie ever made? Maybe not, but it's funny, entertaining and at times very exciting. This movie is definitely worth viewing, and it's better than some of the other stuff being released lately.You can't really go wrong with Bruce Willis, and this style of humor combined with action really suits him. There was room for some more depth in his acting, but my guess is that the director didn't want him to go any deeper. He's obviously fully capable of that. Tracy Morgan is enjoyable as Willis' partner. Is Tracy the best actor ever? Well, you know the answer to that, but the guy is really funny. He puts it all out there for a laugh, and it's fun to watch. Surprisingly, Willis and Morgan have some really good buddy chemistry together in this flick.There were some laugh out loud funny moments, but much of the film was smile on your face funny. The serious moments did draw me in, though it wasn't the most intense film ever. The pace is slow at times, but the entertaining and exciting parts make up for that.

Or is this in essence a buddy cop movie after all? I think it is both, what works is the chemistry between Willis and Morgan and their banter throughout the movie, Willis playing the veteran Detective so well, come on it's Bruce Willis! The guy's awesome.And you got Morgan as his partner who likes to spout movie lines. What works is Morgan's performance, I like Willis and all, he got the dead pan/ wry humor thing down pat, but it's Morgan who shines who seems to have the funnier lines and mannerisms throughout the movie.So the movie, seen these types of stories all to often, two mismatched cops, but somehow work well together, well most of the time take on drug dealers while they go through some sort of crisis in their personal lives, in this case Willis needs to pawn a mint condition 1952 baseball card to pay for his daughter's wedding which gets stolen, while Morgan suspects his lovely wife cheating on him all the while the two cops are trying to track down a drug king pin, find Willis' stolen baseball card which some how ties all in with the drug king pin, throw in some violence, some gun play, a hot female, fart/ poop jokes, two other cop partners (played by Kevin Pollock and Adam Brody) who are the opposite of Willis and Morgan and you got the buddy cop formula down to a T. Your other buddy cop movie coming out this summer Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg's The Other Guys hitting theaters in Aug.The movie is hilarious from start to finish, I wasn't sure what to expect when I pushed play, but it got me laughing first start when Morgan interrogates a guy and saying all kinds of movie lines during the interrogation.A fun movie  worth watching",4,what a couple of....,1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,1753,"['So', 'are', 'filmmakers', 'lampooning', 'satirizing', 'buddy', 'cop', 'movies', 'known', 'man', 'essence', 'buddy', 'cop', 'movie', 'think', 'what', 'chemistry', 'Willis', 'Morgan', 'banter', 'movie', 'Willis', 'playing', 'veteran', 'Detective', 'so', 'well', 'come', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'guy', 'awesome.And', 'got', 'Morgan', 'partner', 'who', 'spout', 'movie', 'lines', 'What', 'Morgan', 'performance', 'like', 'Willis', 'got', 'dead', 'pan/', 'wry', 'humor', 'thing', 'down', 'pat', 'Morgan', 'who', 'shines', 'who', 'have', 'funnier', 'lines', 'mannerisms', 'movie.So', 'movie', 'seen', 'types', 'stories', 'often', 'two', 'mismatched', 'cops', 'somehow', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'well', 'most', 'time', 'take', 'drug', 'dealers', 'go', 'sort', 'crisis', 'personal', 'lives', 'case', 'Willis', 'pawn', 'mint', 'condition', '1952', 'baseball', 'card', 'pay', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'stolen', 'Morgan', 'lovely', 'wife', 'cheating', 'two', 'cops', 'are', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'drug', 'king', 'pin', 'find', 'Willis', 'stolen', 'baseball', 'card', 'how', 'ties', 'drug', 'king', 'pin', 'throw', 'violence', 'gun', 'play', 'hot', 'female', 'fart/', 'poop', 'jokes', 'two', 'other', 'cop', 'partners', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Pollock', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'who', 'are', 'opposite', 'Willis', 'Morgan', 'got', 'buddy', 'cop', 'formula', 'down', 'T.', 'other', 'buddy', 'cop', 'movie', 'coming', 'out', 'summer', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Other', 'Guys', 'hitting', 'theaters', 'Aug.The', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'start', 'finish', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'pushed', 'play', 'got', 'laughing', 'first', 'start', 'when', 'Morgan', 'guy', 'saying', 'kinds', 'movie', 'lines', 'interrogation.A', 'fun', 'movie', 'watching']",N/A

Their investigation leads to gang-related crimes or corrupt authority. There are actions and laughs, and nice soundtrack music, too. ""Cop Out"" is, as one of the film's characters say, ""homage"" to the genre. But homage does not necessarily mean imitation.""Cop Out"" stars Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan as NYPD cops Jimmy and Paul working as partners for nine years. They get suspended by the captain for messing up an undercover drug investigation, and Jimmy is forced to sell a very rare baseball card he owns. He needs money for the wedding party of his daughter Ava (cameo by Michelle Trachtenberg) who is getting married. A masked robber, however, breaks in the shop before he gets money, and takes his vintage card away. The veteran cops track down the stolen card, no matter what it takes, and the story somehow goes back to where it started: a drug lord (who loves baseball) and his gang.This is a Kevin Smith film that is not written by Kevin Smith (written by Mark and Robb Cullen), and this is the most boring film he ever made. It is occasionally fun, I admit, thanks to the stars and Seann William Scott as s small-time crook (equivalent of Joe Pesci's character in ""Lethal Weapon 3""), but random comically-inspired moments (ad-libbed, I suppose) do not make a good film.
