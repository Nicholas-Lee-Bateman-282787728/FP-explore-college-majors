451700,A3VZVYWCTGIEV0,6305161895,"Bill Your 'Free Form FM Print DJ ""bill nicholas""","[2, 3]","Eric Robert's work in Star 80 probably the best acting I have ever seen, bar none.The film is about Paul Snider, Roberts, and Dorthey Stratton, played by Merrial Hemmingway. Dorthey is the girl next door in Vancover, 1978. She meets Snider in a Dairy Queen. They date, have sex, and Paul soon takes pictures of her and sends them to Playboy, where they are soon published. She is flown to Heffner's mansion and introduced into the stardom and money of Playboy's world.Stratton makes a great impression, but Paul, a horrible one. Fuzzy mirror dice, bad fur coats and a dollar sign on a neck chain may work on teenagers, but not in the Playboy circle. Paul is a slimey, repulsive little hustler. He cannot disguise this, and his attempts to only reveal him. He can never fit into the big shoes he seeks--made evident when he is dangled from a hotel window by a loan shark who finanaced one of Paul's wet t-shirt contests.Stratton soon becomes rich and famous and is courted by sophistacated artists and players who sourrounds Heffner. Ironically, she knows how to play the game better then Paul. He tries his Vancover player act on the Playboy people, and it is like a little boy pitching in the majors. He is seen as the small time greaseball he is, and is shut out of Dorthey's new world. Eventually, Dorthey leaves him, but wants to do right. Paul uses this, manipulating her and then almost raping her when she comes to give him money, and then, he kills both her and himself.""They did this,"" he says, pulling the trigger.Roberts works on two condradictory impulses of the audiance in his portrayal of Paul. Paul envokes disgust and pity at the same time. Roberts shows Paul to have no insight into how he destroys everything positive around him by his own posessiveness. Had he said and done nothing, and just enjoyed the ride, what he and Dorthey built might have still been intact.The process of his ruining everything is slow and painful. Another person may have been able to turn it around at any time. Paul is to consummed with narcisism to see that HE is his own problem. You want to shake the poor fool to give him the answer, but you also want to run as far as you can, fast, from this slimeball.You can't stand to look at him, but can't look away. Your body actually tenses up seeing Paul on screen. This is master acting by Roberts, and makes what could have been a soap opera a classic movie.",5,classic,1247443200,"07 13, 2009",2009,2406,"['Eric', 'Robert', 'work', 'Star', '80', 'probably', 'best', 'acting', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'bar', 'none.The', 'film', 'Paul', 'Snider', 'Roberts', 'Dorthey', 'Stratton', 'played', 'Merrial', 'Hemmingway', 'Dorthey', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'Vancover', '1978', 'Snider', 'Dairy', 'Queen', 'date', 'have', 'sex', 'Paul', 'soon', 'pictures', 'Playboy', 'where', 'are', 'soon', 'published', 'flown', 'Heffner', 'mansion', 'introduced', 'stardom', 'money', 'Playboy', 'world.Stratton', 'great', 'impression', 'Paul', 'horrible', 'one', 'Fuzzy', 'mirror', 'dice', 'bad', 'fur', 'coats', 'dollar', 'sign', 'neck', 'chain', 'may', 'work', 'teenagers', 'not', 'Playboy', 'circle', 'Paul', 'slimey', 'repulsive', 'little', 'hustler', 'can', 'not', 'disguise', 'attempts', 'only', 'reveal', 'can', 'never', 'fit', 'big', 'shoes', 'made', 'evident', 'when', 'dangled', 'hotel', 'window', 'loan', 'shark', 'who', 'finanaced', 'one', 'Paul', 'wet', 't-shirt', 'contests.Stratton', 'soon', 'rich', 'famous', 'courted', 'sophistacated', 'artists', 'players', 'who', 'Heffner', 'Ironically', 'how', 'play', 'game', 'better', 'then', 'Paul', 'Vancover', 'player', 'act', 'Playboy', 'people', 'little', 'boy', 'pitching', 'majors', 'seen', 'small', 'time', 'greaseball', 'shut', 'Dorthey', 'new', 'world', 'Eventually', 'Dorthey', 'do', 'right', 'Paul', 'manipulating', 'then', 'almost', 'raping', 'when', 'give', 'money', 'then', 'did', 'pulling', 'trigger.Roberts', 'works', 'two', 'condradictory', 'impulses', 'audiance', 'portrayal', 'Paul', 'Paul', 'disgust', 'pity', 'same', 'time', 'Roberts', 'Paul', 'have', 'insight', 'how', 'everything', 'positive', 'own', 'posessiveness', 'Had', 'said', 'done', 'nothing', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'ride', 'what', 'Dorthey', 'built', 'might', 'have', 'still', 'been', 'intact.The', 'process', 'ruining', 'everything', 'slow', 'painful', 'person', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'turn', 'around', 'time', 'Paul', 'consummed', 'narcisism', 'see', 'HE', 'own', 'problem', 'want', 'shake', 'poor', 'fool', 'give', 'answer', 'also', 'want', 'run', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'fast', 'slimeball.You', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'look', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'away', 'body', 'actually', 'up', 'seeing', 'Paul', 'screen', 'master', 'acting', 'Roberts', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'soap', 'opera', 'classic', 'movie']",Star 80
451701,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6305161895,Byron Kolln,"[8, 10]","STAR 80 recounts Playboy centrefold Dorothy Stratten, whose life and career was cut short by her unhinged husband/manager.  The film is told in flashback.  Seventeen year-old Dorothy (Mariel Hemingway) meets small-time hustler Paul Snider (Eric Roberts) whilst she is working at the local Dairy Queen in Vancouver.  To the horror of her mother (Carroll Baker), Paul begins to court Dorothy and escorts her to the Senior Prom, and later (after their wedding) convinces the barely-legal girl to pose nude for a series of photo shoots, in the hopes of getting her on the cover of Playboy.  Dorothy lands in Los Angeles and indeed becomes the August centrefold and later Playmate of the Year.  She wins over the press and public with her wholesome attitude and shining innocence, the ultimate golden girl.As her fame grew and began to threaten his controlling influence, Dorothy's life dissolved into a bizarre and twisted version of ""A Star is Born"", when Paul became suffocated by his wife's success.  What Paul didn't count on was the fact that at some point Dorothy would be able to manage things by herself.  On the cusp of Hollywood superstardom, Dorothy was lured back to Paul's apartment where she was raped, tortured and murdered.  She was twenty years old.  Paul later turned the rifle on himself; the last cowardly move of a classic sociopath.We will never know if Stratten was capable of becoming a serious movie star, but her guest spots on the TV shows ""Fantasy Island"" and ""Buck Rogers"" displayed her growing talents and if correctly cultivated, she may well have become quite a screen sensation.  Followers of Stratten were quick to notice that the casting of Mariel Hemingway was quite eerie, because Stratten's gravestone features a quote from Ernest Hemingway (Mariel's grandfather).Bob Fosse's STAR 80 was cruelly-ignored by the Academy Awards, even though both Mariel Hemingway and Eric Roberts deliver Oscar-worthy performances.  The film is full of classic Bob Fosse quick-cutting and camera tricks; most people were surprised that Fosse decided to film the life of Stratten, but when you consider that both ""Cabaret"" and ""All That Jazz"" also expose the seamy underbelly of sub-culture, the matching of movie and director could not be more perfect.  The screenplay (by Fosse) was based on Teresa Carpenter's fascinating article ""Death of a Playmate"".Also starring Cliff Robertson, Roger Rees, Josh Mostel, Sidney Miller, Keenen Ivory Wayans, David Clennon and Stuart Damon.TECHNICAL DETAILS:Aspect Ratio: 1:85:1 (anamorphic widescreen)Single-sided, single-layer discSnapper caseAudio: English (mono)Subtitles: English, English (hearing impaired)",4,the life and death of a golden girl,1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,2664,"['STAR', '80', 'recounts', 'Playboy', 'centrefold', 'Dorothy', 'Stratten', 'life', 'career', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'unhinged', 'husband/manager', 'film', 'told', 'flashback', 'Seventeen', 'year-old', 'Dorothy', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'small-time', 'hustler', 'Paul', 'Snider', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'whilst', 'working', 'local', 'Dairy', 'Queen', 'Vancouver', 'horror', 'mother', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'Paul', 'court', 'Dorothy', 'Senior', 'Prom', 'later', 'wedding', 'barely-legal', 'girl', 'pose', 'nude', 'series', 'photo', 'shoots', 'hopes', 'getting', 'cover', 'Playboy', 'Dorothy', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'indeed', 'August', 'centrefold', 'later', 'Playmate', 'Year', 'press', 'public', 'wholesome', 'attitude', 'shining', 'innocence', 'ultimate', 'golden', 'girl.As', 'fame', 'grew', 'began', 'threaten', 'controlling', 'influence', 'Dorothy', 'life', 'dissolved', 'bizarre', 'twisted', 'version', 'A', 'Star', 'Born', 'when', 'Paul', 'became', 'suffocated', 'wife', 'success', 'What', 'Paul', 'did', ""n't"", 'count', 'was', 'fact', 'point', 'Dorothy', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'manage', 'things', 'cusp', 'Hollywood', 'superstardom', 'Dorothy', 'was', 'lured', 'back', 'Paul', 'apartment', 'where', 'was', 'raped', 'tortured', 'murdered', 'was', 'twenty', 'years', 'old', 'Paul', 'later', 'turned', 'rifle', 'last', 'cowardly', 'move', 'classic', 'sociopath.We', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'Stratten', 'was', 'capable', 'becoming', 'serious', 'movie', 'star', 'guest', 'spots', 'TV', 'Fantasy', 'Island', 'Buck', 'Rogers', 'displayed', 'growing', 'talents', 'correctly', 'cultivated', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'become', 'quite', 'screen', 'sensation', 'Followers', 'Stratten', 'were', 'quick', 'notice', 'casting', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'was', 'quite', 'eerie', 'Stratten', 'gravestone', 'quote', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'Mariel', 'grandfather', 'Fosse', 'STAR', '80', 'was', 'cruelly-ignored', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'even', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'deliver', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performances', 'film', 'full', 'classic', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'quick-cutting', 'camera', 'tricks', 'most', 'people', 'were', 'surprised', 'Fosse', 'decided', 'film', 'life', 'Stratten', 'when', 'consider', 'Cabaret', 'Jazz', 'also', 'expose', 'seamy', 'underbelly', 'sub-culture', 'matching', 'movie', 'director', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'perfect', 'screenplay', 'Fosse', 'was', 'based', 'Teresa', 'Carpenter', 'fascinating', 'article', 'Death', 'Playmate', '.Also', 'starring', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Roger', 'Rees', 'Josh', 'Mostel', 'Sidney', 'Miller', 'Keenen', 'Ivory', 'Wayans', 'David', 'Clennon', 'Stuart', 'Damon.TECHNICAL', 'DETAILS', 'Aspect', 'Ratio', '1:85:1', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'Single-sided', 'single-layer', 'discSnapper', 'caseAudio', 'English', 'mono', 'English', 'English', 'hearing', 'impaired']",Star 80

The real-life tale of Playmate Dorothy Stratten's life and murder at the hands of her manager husband Paul Snider is tragic, to say the least.Eric Roberts portrays Snider in such a three dimensional way that you almost feel a tinge of sympathy for how pathetic he is. In fact, this part pretty much ruined Roberts career - not because he was bad, but because he was so chillingly good. I read an interview where he said that he became stereotyped as a creepy psycho after this film, even though he had had some romantic lead roles (Raggedy Man, Nobody's Fool) prior to Star 80.

Had he not been so slimy, jealous and envious, he would have made it on his own.Instead, the guy took advantage of a naive girl in her late-teens and wanted to ride her coattails.  It was only when she got wise to his game, and with encouragement from her boyfriend Peter Bogdonavich (whose name was changed in the movie), that she wanted to make a clean break from Snider.Abused women always think that if they face their abuser one more time things will straighten themselves out.  Nine times out of ten, they make a monster mistake that they later regret (or don't live to regret).The final scene was weird, to say the least, and it didn't show everything (yes, it requires one to fill in the blanks) but the way Snider snapped when he realized his meal ticket was leaving him sticks with you long after the movie has ended.Mariel Hemingway played a convincing Dorothy Stratten (I had to do a double take of the cover to ensure it wasn't the real thing) and Eric Roberts played a mean Paul Snider.This should be essential viewing.",5,The final scene *does* stick with you,1127779200,"09 27, 2005",2005,1466,"['movie', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'mentally', 'and/or', 'physically', 'abusive', 'relationships', 'need', 'be', 'given', 'little', 'push', 'light', 'translation', 'need', 'run', 'not', 'walk', 'first', 'sign', 'possessiveness', '.It', 'was', 'waste', 'Paul', 'Snider', 'had', 'charm', 'used', 'car', 'salesman', 'guy', 'did', 'find', 'people', 'produce', 'good', 'ideas', 'Dorothy', 'Stratten', 'founded', 'Chippendales', 'other', 'things', 'Had', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'slimy', 'jealous', 'envious', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'own.Instead', 'guy', 'took', 'advantage', 'naive', 'girl', 'late-teens', 'wanted', 'ride', 'coattails', 'was', 'only', 'when', 'got', 'wise', 'game', 'encouragement', 'boyfriend', 'Peter', 'Bogdonavich', 'name', 'was', 'changed', 'movie', 'wanted', 'make', 'clean', 'break', 'Snider.Abused', 'women', 'always', 'think', 'face', 'abuser', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'things', 'will', 'straighten', 'out', 'Nine', 'ten', 'make', 'monster', 'mistake', 'later', 'regret', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'regret', '.The', 'final', 'scene', 'was', 'weird', 'say', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'everything', 'yes', 'one', 'fill', 'blanks', 'way', 'Snider', 'snapped', 'when', 'realized', 'meal', 'ticket', 'was', 'leaving', 'sticks', 'long', 'movie', 'ended.Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'played', 'convincing', 'Dorothy', 'Stratten', 'had', 'do', 'double', 'take', 'cover', 'ensure', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'thing', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'played', 'mean', 'Paul', 'Snider.This', 'should', 'be', 'essential', 'viewing']",Star 80
451707,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6305161895,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[61, 62]","Dorothy Stratten received considerable attention for her 1980 Playboy centerfold spread, which showcased her girl-next-door beauty and personality to remarkable effect.  Most who knew her described her as a very sweet, kind, and strangely innocent young woman, and although her name as such was not well known to the public at large, many industry insiders felt she was on the fast-track to Hollywood stardom.  We will never know if she could have made the career many expected of her, for little more than a year after her debut in Playboy her promoter, manager, and husband Paul Snider blew her head off with a shotgun.Mariel Hemingway gives the performance of her career as Stratten, capturing the mixture of wholesome beauty and vulnerability that so many of Stratten's acquaintances described. But STAR 80 is actually less about Stratten than it is about Paul Snider, the small-time hustler who discovered, promoted, and married her--and then lost her through a combination of his own hysterical insecurity and her rising fame.  Eric Roberts is simply bone-chilling in the role; it is a performance that should have earned him an Academy Award.  The supporting cast is equally fine, with Cliff Robertson and Carroll Baker as Hugh Hefner and Dorothy's mother respectively.  But the film goes beyond offering exceptional performances in a tragic story of promising youth cut short.Director and writer Bob Fosse begins his story with Stratten's death and then presents the history of the Stratton-Snider relationship in a semi-documentary style through flashbacks and flash-forwards.  The style serves him very well, for the film quickly develops such intensity that at times it becomes extremely difficult to watch.  As it progresses, the story itself becomes a metaphor for hedonism of the 1970s surging into the 1980s: a poisonous mixture of superficial appearances, selfishness, user-mentalities, and disposability.  As viewers, we are trapped in a count-down to death, unable to alter a single misstep in Stratten's final days and horrified by the inextoriable drift toward violence.  The final ten minutes of the film are certainly among the most powerful, disturbing, and upsetting ever put to film.STAR 80 proved too unpleasantly real for box office success.  This is not an ""entertaining"" film.  But it is a brilliantly done film, one undimmed by the passage of twenty years--and one that, sadly, will likely be as valid twenty years from now as it is today.

The film takes a hold of you and pulls you along against your will as it speeds along faster and faster to the heartbreaking end. You want to stop the chain of events and change the outcome but you know you cannot. Instead you are merely the observer of the story which leaves you wrung-out and emotionally wrecked by the end. One of the best films of the 80s.Easily Eric Robert's best film. The man became Paul Snider. Simple as that. Same can be said of Mariel Hemingway's performance. She captures the small-town girl caught in the center of the whirlwind perfectly. Had another more experienced actress played the role they would have come across too perfect.

The film is a gritty look at a beautiful tragedy.  Modern viewers will be transported back two decades to the styles, colors, and attitudes of the late 1970's.Stratten was a star for one short year.  She was Playboy's Miss August for 1979, Playmate of the Year for 1980, enjoyed a brief acting career, and then had her life cut short by her obsessively jealous and controlling husband in August 1980.  Paul Snider took the Diary Queen waitress from Vancouver, British Columbia to Hollywood to start her modeling career and worm his way into the Playboy Mansion.  As Stratten's star grew brighter, Snider became more controlling, and his fits often interrupted her modeling and acting work.  He was banned from sets, and after Stratten escaped to New York to film a movie by Peter Bogdanovich, she began an affair with the director and left Snider.The film is told in flashback, opening with a blood-covered Snider talking aloud to an absent Stratten as he destroys pictures of his former wife.  The viewer has no illusions about the outcome of the film and the vicious end to the life of a young starlet.  On an interesting side note (not included in the film), Bogdanovich married Stratten's younger sister Louise after Dorothy was murdered.",4,A gritty look at a beautiful tragedy,1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,1436,"['Director', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'made', 'Star', '80', '1983', 'just', 'two', 'years', 'brutal', 'murder', '1980', 'Playmate', 'Year', 'Dorothy', 'Stratten', 'hands', 'husband/manager/wannabe-pimp', 'Paul', 'Sinder', 'film', 'gritty', 'look', 'beautiful', 'tragedy', 'Modern', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'transported', 'back', 'two', 'decades', 'styles', 'colors', 'attitudes', 'late', ""1970's.Stratten"", 'was', 'star', 'one', 'short', 'year', 'was', 'Playboy', 'Miss', 'August', '1979', 'Playmate', 'Year', '1980', 'enjoyed', 'brief', 'acting', 'career', 'then', 'had', 'life', 'cut', 'short', 'obsessively', 'jealous', 'controlling', 'husband', 'August', '1980', 'Paul', 'Snider', 'took', 'Diary', 'Queen', 'waitress', 'Vancouver', 'British', 'Columbia', 'Hollywood', 'start', 'modeling', 'career', 'worm', 'way', 'Playboy', 'Mansion', 'Stratten', 'star', 'grew', 'brighter', 'Snider', 'became', 'more', 'controlling', 'fits', 'often', 'interrupted', 'modeling', 'acting', 'work', 'was', 'banned', 'sets', 'Stratten', 'escaped', 'New', 'York', 'film', 'movie', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'began', 'affair', 'director', 'left', 'Snider.The', 'film', 'told', 'flashback', 'opening', 'blood-covered', 'Snider', 'talking', 'aloud', 'absent', 'Stratten', 'pictures', 'former', 'wife', 'viewer', 'illusions', 'outcome', 'film', 'vicious', 'end', 'life', 'young', 'starlet', 'interesting', 'side', 'note', 'not', 'included', 'film', 'Bogdanovich', 'married', 'Stratten', 'younger', 'sister', 'Louise', 'Dorothy', 'was', 'murdered']",Star 80

When Vancouver car show promoter Paul Snider (Eric Roberts) ""discovered"" Dorothy Stratten (Mariel Hemingway) working behind the counter at a fast food joint, he thought he'd hit paydirt. Snider, aside from his pimpishly tasteless 70's duds and lack of sophistication had a good eye for them, Stratten was a beautiful girl and Playboy and Hollywood were quick to recognize that. And quick to get her away from the man who brought her to the ""big dance"".Eric Roberts received much deserved acclaim for his role as the sleazy desperate hustler Snider who see's his little star began to blossom into something better. Hemingway, while not bad, plays a pretty empty role and doesn't exude sexiness or really any lovable innocence as Stratten was said to possess. The film is dark, and the depression and loss for Snider builds into a sad crescendo that while not unexpected is very shocking and depressing in itself.The writers present a moral equivalence with Hugh Hefner and Paul Snider, the former the worlds best known peddler of girlie mags, the latter a cheap wannabe who nonetheless lived in the same world.One can argue that both men are employed in similar exploitation, and can hypothesise that Hefner might not find his Playmates without the bartenders, strip-club and wet T-shirt promoters like Snider. It's a stretch, as Hefner surely never committed the atrocity of murder-suicide as Snider does. But, if you want to provoke a little thought and look into Showbiz in general, you can't paint Snider merely  a domestic abuser when his anger came from losing his wife, but his ""ticket"" to bigger and brighter things.

It is more than just losing a meal ticket; it is instead the total self-negation it represents to him as someone who is dominated by feelings of worthlessness and a corrosive mixture of inadequacy, insecurity and hatred towards those he perceives as successful, rich and powerful.

No doubt about it, this movie broke my heart.  Mariel Hemingway shines in the role of Dorothy Stratten, but it is Eric Roberts who steals the show as Paul Snider, Dorothy's estranged husband.  From start to finish, you will be riveted by the performances.Dorothy remains a compelling figure in my mind, although I came into the world three years after her death.  ""Star 80"" is a cautionary tale.  Hemingway doesn't possess the ethereal beauty of Dorothy, but she does portray Dorothy's endearing innocence convincingly.  Eric Roberts is simply psychotic in his depiction of Paul Snider.

451728,A3PKTO0UJJJ8BS,6305161895,"Sunny California ""JR""","[1, 1]","I love this movie. Back in the 90s I saw this for the first time and several times more because I found the story of Dorothy Stratten so totally fascinating. It's like the quintessential starry-eyed young beauty and the Hollywood beast tale which is all the more horrifying because it actually happened.The tragic result of this is the loss of Stratten, of course. Hef, Snyder and Bogdanovich have a similar tendency as users of women for their own gain -they've profited in various ways from their position in society. Is it their fault that they use their powers as a way to make up for what God didn't give them (looks)? Not really. It's just that these two are so quick to pounce on Paul Snyder and use a very colorful brush to paint him as a pimp, when in fact, they're not that much different. They just did it better. I guess that makes what they do as ""art"", and socially acceptable. Right? I always found it mildly interesting that Snyder had looks but wasn't talented, and Hef and Bogdanovich are unattractive, but talented.It's been said that Snyder was frowned upon because he was a small-time hustler by Hefner, which sounds about right.  In an interview I saw recently, Bogdanovich said that Hefner said that Snyder ""looked like a pimp"" when he visited his then-wife Stratten at the Hollywood mansion. I could imagine that Snyder, who obviously was in the trade, enjoyed being shown the fruits of his labors, only to have them yanked away by these ""alpha"" males.Not to say that she didn't enjoy the luxury and fame that she gained from her own good looks and endearing personality, but Stratten was a lamb led to slaughter. Literally. Movies, articles and books can all paint her as an angel (and we're talking about someone who went from working at a Dairy Queen at 18 to Playboy's Centerfold of the Year for the magazine's 25th anniversary) -in a Tonight Show interview, we can see someone who is just starting to realize their own value (go to YouTube and search it if you're curious). It's sad, because it's too little, too late.The movie does a good job of reinforcing Snyder's creepy pimp personae, a Svengali-like person who was responsible for Stratten's ""discovery"" and subsequent fame. Eric Roberts is really, really good at giving us the slimy sneer of an evil wrongdoer and is perfect for the part. But for someone who might not consider Hefner and Bogdanovich's roles in Stratten's short career, the movie might lead them to believe that these two men are some sort of safety anchor for the fluttering, angelic starlet, so well-portrayed by Mariel Hemingway (who has very similar physical characteristics to the late Stratten and beams with innocence throughout that is totally convincing). I mean, she was 18-20 when all of this happened, and these men were all older than her -so of course someone this beautiful and naive is going to be a thing, something that can be gained from in some way. That said, I found it fairly annoying that these two are shown as some sort of voice of reason, constantly trying to look out for what can be perceived as an obvious asset to them both. Look, I'm sure these two had REAL feelings and concerns for Stratten, I just found it important to look deeper than that when taking in the entire ""picture"". All three of these guys had both their hands -and other parts - out come collection time.In fact, I saw an interview with Bogdanovich about Stratten's death, and he says that her death was ""the beginning of the end for him"", which struck me as odd, given that he married her kid sister (it ended in divorce, BTW).So, now that I've gone off on what might be seen as a feminist view of Stratten's story, I just wanted to say how haunting and well done this movie is. They got the 70s/80s flav going on. Actors are top notch. It's not a nice story. It's dramatic and depressing. You want Stratten to win in the end, but we all know that this Cinderella story has a brutal and tragic end. It's the story of a woman being pulled in all directions and then torn apart. It's not for everyone. I recommend it, but only for those who enjoy true crime sort of docudramas and can handle the brutality of the last moments of this movie, which are pretty jarring in their depiction of what happened when Snyder killed Stratten and then himself.If he couldn't ""have"" her, nobody could. So he destroyed her and that, folks, is the sad end to it all.",5,The tragic death of Dorothy Stratten,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,4401,"['love', 'movie', 'Back', '90s', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'several', 'times', 'more', 'found', 'story', 'Dorothy', 'Stratten', 'so', 'totally', 'fascinating', 'quintessential', 'starry-eyed', 'young', 'beauty', 'Hollywood', 'beast', 'tale', 'more', 'horrifying', 'actually', 'tragic', 'result', 'loss', 'Stratten', 'course', 'Hef', 'Snyder', 'Bogdanovich', 'have', 'similar', 'tendency', 'users', 'women', 'own', 'gain', '-they', ""'ve"", 'profited', 'various', 'ways', 'position', 'society', 'fault', 'use', 'powers', 'way', 'make', 'up', 'what', 'God', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'Not', 'really', 'just', 'two', 'are', 'so', 'quick', 'pounce', 'Paul', 'Snyder', 'use', 'very', 'colorful', 'brush', 'paint', 'pimp', 'when', 'fact', ""'re"", 'not', 'that', 'much', 'different', 'just', 'did', 'better', 'guess', 'what', 'do', 'art', 'socially', 'acceptable', 'Right', 'always', 'found', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'Snyder', 'had', 'looks', 'was', ""n't"", 'talented', 'Hef', 'Bogdanovich', 'are', 'unattractive', 'talented.It', 'been', 'said', 'Snyder', 'was', 'frowned', 'upon', 'was', 'small-time', 'hustler', 'Hefner', 'right', 'interview', 'saw', 'recently', 'Bogdanovich', 'said', 'Hefner', 'said', 'Snyder', 'looked', 'pimp', 'when', 'visited', 'then-wife', 'Stratten', 'Hollywood', 'mansion', 'could', 'imagine', 'Snyder', 'who', 'obviously', 'was', 'trade', 'enjoyed', 'being', 'shown', 'fruits', 'labors', 'only', 'have', 'yanked', 'away', 'alpha', 'males.Not', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'luxury', 'fame', 'gained', 'own', 'good', 'looks', 'endearing', 'personality', 'Stratten', 'was', 'lamb', 'led', 'slaughter', 'Literally', 'Movies', 'articles', 'books', 'can', 'paint', 'angel', ""'re"", 'talking', 'someone', 'who', 'went', 'working', 'Dairy', 'Queen', '18', 'Playboy', 'Centerfold', 'Year', 'magazine', '25th', 'anniversary', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'interview', 'can', 'see', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'starting', 'realize', 'own', 'value', 'go', 'YouTube', 'search', ""'re"", 'curious', 'sad', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late.The', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'reinforcing', 'Snyder', 'creepy', 'pimp', 'personae', 'Svengali-like', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'Stratten', 'discovery', 'subsequent', 'fame', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'giving', 'slimy', 'sneer', 'evil', 'wrongdoer', 'perfect', 'part', 'someone', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'consider', 'Hefner', 'Bogdanovich', 'roles', 'Stratten', 'short', 'career', 'movie', 'might', 'lead', 'believe', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'sort', 'safety', 'anchor', 'fluttering', 'angelic', 'starlet', 'well-portrayed', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'who', 'very', 'similar', 'physical', 'characteristics', 'late', 'Stratten', 'beams', 'innocence', 'totally', 'convincing', 'mean', 'was', '18-20', 'when', 'happened', 'men', 'were', 'older', '-so', 'course', 'someone', 'beautiful', 'naive', 'going', 'be', 'thing', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'gained', 'way', 'said', 'found', 'fairly', 'annoying', 'two', 'are', 'shown', 'sort', 'voice', 'reason', 'constantly', 'trying', 'look', 'out', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'perceived', 'obvious', 'asset', 'Look', ""'m"", 'sure', 'two', 'had', 'REAL', 'feelings', 'concerns', 'Stratten', 'just', 'found', 'important', 'look', 'deeper', 'when', 'taking', 'entire', 'picture', 'three', 'guys', 'had', 'hands', '-and', 'other', 'parts', 'out', 'come', 'collection', 'time.In', 'fact', 'saw', 'interview', 'Bogdanovich', 'Stratten', 'death', 'death', 'was', 'beginning', 'end', 'struck', 'odd', 'given', 'married', 'kid', 'sister', 'ended', 'divorce', 'BTW', '.So', 'now', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'off', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'seen', 'feminist', 'view', 'Stratten', 'story', 'just', 'wanted', 'say', 'how', 'haunting', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'got', '70s/80s', 'flav', 'going', 'Actors', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'not', 'nice', 'story', 'dramatic', 'depressing', 'want', 'Stratten', 'win', 'end', 'know', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'brutal', 'tragic', 'end', 'story', 'woman', 'being', 'pulled', 'directions', 'then', 'torn', 'apart', 'not', 'everyone', 'recommend', 'only', 'who', 'enjoy', 'true', 'crime', 'sort', 'docudramas', 'can', 'handle', 'brutality', 'last', 'moments', 'movie', 'are', 'pretty', 'jarring', 'depiction', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'Snyder', 'killed', 'Stratten', 'then', 'himself.If', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'nobody', 'could', 'So', 'destroyed', 'folks', 'sad', 'end']",Star 80
451729,A26A8T38C2GQD7,6305161895,Taheen Lopez,"[0, 1]","Legendary director/dancer/choreographer Bob Fosse may have been a consummate entertainer, responsible for popular productions on the Broadway stage, but he was also an uncompromising filmmaker who wasn't afraid to explore the dark side of humanity.After the autobiographical intensity of All That Jazz, Fosse's final film was this honest and painfully authentic biography about Dorothy Stratten(Mariel Hemingway), who was Playboy's Playmate of the Year for 1979 and had just begun a promising film career when her jealous boyfriend took a shotgun to her head.Fosse tackles this brutal reality head on, opening the film with the aftermath of murder and telling the story in flashback, beginning in Vancouver when slick charmer Paul Snider (Eric Roberts) discovers Dorothy and makes her his ticket to fame and unearned glory.He's a loser and a user, and when Dorothy rises to success and glamour at the Playboy mansion, Hugh Hefner (Cliff Robertson) urges the blonde beauty to drop her troublesome boyfriend.Jealousy and rejection push Paul over the edge, but Star 80 (the title is taken from Snider's vanity license plates) is no simple tale of male ego gone bad. Fosse explores the chasm between fame and obscurity, and the self-destructive lengths to which some people will go to bridge that gap.The film is a darker telling of the kind of story ""Boogie Nights"" would tell nearly 15 years later--both films are set in the late '70s and early '80s, and both deal with the inevitable loss of innocence in a world where innocence cannot survive.In a bleak but fascinating way, Star 80 is masterful in its refusal to look away from the tragedy of its true story. It's a farewell statement from a director who clearly understood the high cost of stardom.This drama flick takes me back to memory lane to when I was 11 years old in the 5th grade during its theatrical release in the Fall of 1983.",3,Fame Isn't Everything It's Cracked Up To Be,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,1890,"['Legendary', 'director/dancer/choreographer', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'consummate', 'entertainer', 'responsible', 'popular', 'productions', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'was', 'also', 'uncompromising', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'explore', 'dark', 'side', 'humanity.After', 'autobiographical', 'intensity', 'Jazz', 'Fosse', 'final', 'film', 'was', 'honest', 'painfully', 'authentic', 'biography', 'Dorothy', 'Stratten', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'who', 'was', 'Playboy', 'Playmate', 'Year', '1979', 'had', 'just', 'begun', 'promising', 'film', 'career', 'when', 'jealous', 'boyfriend', 'took', 'shotgun', 'head.Fosse', 'brutal', 'reality', 'head', 'opening', 'film', 'aftermath', 'murder', 'telling', 'story', 'flashback', 'beginning', 'Vancouver', 'when', 'slick', 'charmer', 'Paul', 'Snider', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'Dorothy', 'ticket', 'fame', 'unearned', 'glory.He', 'loser', 'user', 'when', 'Dorothy', 'success', 'glamour', 'Playboy', 'mansion', 'Hugh', 'Hefner', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'blonde', 'beauty', 'drop', 'troublesome', 'boyfriend.Jealousy', 'rejection', 'push', 'Paul', 'edge', 'Star', '80', 'title', 'taken', 'Snider', 'vanity', 'license', 'plates', 'simple', 'tale', 'male', 'ego', 'gone', 'bad', 'Fosse', 'chasm', 'fame', 'obscurity', 'self-destructive', 'lengths', 'people', 'will', 'go', 'bridge', 'gap.The', 'film', 'darker', 'telling', 'kind', 'story', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'would', 'tell', 'nearly', '15', 'years', 'later', 'films', 'are', 'set', 'late', ""'70s"", 'early', ""'80s"", 'deal', 'inevitable', 'loss', 'innocence', 'world', 'where', 'innocence', 'can', 'not', 'survive.In', 'bleak', 'fascinating', 'way', 'Star', '80', 'masterful', 'refusal', 'look', 'away', 'tragedy', 'true', 'story', 'farewell', 'statement', 'director', 'who', 'clearly', 'understood', 'high', 'cost', 'stardom.This', 'drama', 'flick', 'back', 'memory', 'lane', 'when', 'was', '11', 'years', 'old', '5th', 'grade', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Fall', '1983']",Star 80

In the lobby were photos of famous people who'd also got married there (Rodney Dangerfield, sports figures) and next to the front door was a large photo of Dorothy Stratten standing outside the Silver Bell.  All smiles, gorgeous, alone.When I asked about the photo, I was told, ""Yes, she got married here.  Such a beautiful girl...we refuse to hang any photos of him.""The ""him"" whose name was never mentioned was Paul Snider, the man she married that day.  He was also the monster who blew her head off with a shotgun and raped her dead body before killing himself in the summer of 1980.STAR 80 is the unflinching movie about the life and horrible death of Dorothy Stratten.  It's written and directed by Bob Fosse (he'd turned the same dazzling but bleak eye on his own life in 1979's ALL THAT JAZZ) and it feels at time exactly like a documentary.  I believe the source material was a Village Voice article by Teresa Carpenter called ""Life & Death of a Centerfold.""Mariel Hemingway has always been a competent actress but I didn't feel that she was beautiful enough to be Dorothy Stratten.  I hate to say that.  To be fair, I'm not sure any woman could've done Dorothy justice.  If you've never seen her, do a web search or something.  She really was one of the most naturally magnificent examples of beauty I've ever seen.  I used to look at her pictorials and marvel at every curve on the woman.I know Ms. Hemingway had a breast enhancement prior to the role--but I kept thinking of the real thing(s) and it (they) were distracting.  Sorry.  Everything about her--eyes, lips, hips, legs, everything--looked like finely-crafted perfection.I don't remember if Eric Roberts was nominated for anything, but he definitely deserved some award for committing to film the most realistic depiction of a complete and utter scumbag up to that point.  That Fosse could include scenes that even made Snider somewhat sympathetic--how far would you go to find fame?--makes the movie that much more powerful and even numbing.Much was made at the time of the perfect casting of Cliff Robertson as Hugh M. Hefner.  Robertson had been involved in a huge money scandal at Columbia Pictures and offers for roles quickly dried up for a while until Fosse cast him as Hef.  A great move as well as a brave one.  (Robertson went on to work more, most recently as Spider-man's Uncle Ben in that blockbuster franchise).Plus, he's a great Hef.Look fast for a young Keenen Ivory Wayans as a young comic and Liz Sheridan as a makeup girl (she went on to play Jerry Seinfeld's mom on ""Seinfeld"" and she's also claimed to be one of James Dean's lovers!).This is a much better film than BOOGIE NIGHTS and WONDERLAND (both of those were based on the sordid life of John Holmes, a biography still waiting for a honest treatment as far as I'm concerned).  Check it out.By the way, the Silver Bell Wedding Chapel burned to the ground a couple of years ago.

If you are looking for neat features like audio commentary, deleted scenes and the like, you will not find them here. Only chapter selections on a pan and scan format. It did not include the pictures for the scene selections and that was a bit frustrating to navigate when I tried jumping into the miiddle of the film. So as far a DVD goes, thumbs down.If however you are looking for a great film, you have hit the jackpot! Fosse's writing is amazing and is carried off by some excellent acting. Eric Roberts balances one challenging role. As the husband/manager living off his wifes fame and popularity, he comes across as a second rate Ike Turner. The man is a slime and you still manage to find some sympathy for him. Watching his behavior his fascinating, and we have seen his like in one form or another. One who portrays what he thinks a rich and glamourous life style is by spouting off ham-handed dialouge and wearing tacky clothes who doesent realize the joke is on him. When finally does, it ends with tragic results. I've not been a big fan of Roberts until this movie.Hemingway is also very effective as the centerfold with the heart of gold. The contrast of her and Roberts works nicely. She may not be the smartest person but at least she knows who she is. Her flaw is that she tries to please everyone and that of course also leads tragically.The only flaw to this film is it's production value. Many would argue that it was 1983 when the movie was made, but it still has the feel of a after school special. There really is no style to the film. Just point and shoot film.

The last 10 minutes are quite possibly the saddest scenes I have seen in a movie.The Australian DVD is thankfully presented in its original widescreen presentation (and anamorphic too) unlike the American pan and scan version.I'm surprised Mariel Hemingway's career didn't take off because she is an exceptional actress.",4,"Overlooked, yet worth your time",1069027200,"11 17, 2003",2003,634,"['Star80', 'very', 'overlooked', 'movie', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'Eric', 'Roberts.Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'Dorothy', 'Stratten', 'famous', 'model', 'who', 'lunatic', 'played', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'dominate', 'life', 'career', 'tragic', 'circumstances', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'are', 'quite', 'possibly', 'saddest', 'scenes', 'have', 'seen', 'movie.The', 'Australian', 'DVD', 'thankfully', 'presented', 'original', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'anamorphic', 'too', 'American', 'pan', 'scan', 'version.I', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'career', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'off', 'exceptional', 'actress']",Star 80
