John Corbett, as he did in My Big Fat Greek Wedding, did a great job and Kim Basinger played the role just as it should have been played. The script is well plotted out.  Unlike another reviewer, who claims to be a fan of Kim Basinger's, it is obvious she has great comedic skills as first revealed in My Stepmother Is An Alien.  It is a love story for Heaven's sake and a satire as well!  There is a generous dose of authentic Elvis music which makes you overlook some terrible impersonations.  The music is meshed cleverly into the plot and it is a joy to the ear.  Despite the PG 13, due to some violent death scenes, it is still a good family film.",5,Elvis  fans will love this and should.,1123286400,"08 6, 2005",2005,740,"['one', 'Elvis', 'related', 'film', 'Elvis', 'fans', 'fans', 'music', 'general', 'will', 'love', 'John', 'Corbett', 'did', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'played', 'role', 'just', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'script', 'well', 'plotted', 'out', 'reviewer', 'who', 'be', 'fan', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'obvious', 'great', 'comedic', 'skills', 'first', 'revealed', 'My', 'Stepmother', 'Alien', 'love', 'story', 'Heaven', 'sake', 'satire', 'well', 'generous', 'dose', 'authentic', 'Elvis', 'music', 'overlook', 'terrible', 'impersonations', 'music', 'meshed', 'cleverly', 'plot', 'joy', 'ear', 'PG', '13', 'due', 'violent', 'death', 'scenes', 'still', 'good', 'family', 'film']",Elvis Has Left The Building

914396,A1PVM3V959JFYM,B0009W5KHM,Lovely to See You,"[18, 18]","I didn't think much of My Big Fat Greek Wedding, but I liked this movie a lot.  I bought it yesterday at this writing for 5 bucks at a local video store, and found myself laughing a lot.  I don't know if it helps not to be an Elvis fan, but even if you are, let's admit it:  there are too many knockoffs of the King running around--lots of them truly as bad as what are portrayed in this offering--and as Basinger's character says in the end, he's probably not too happy about it.I became a Basinger fan when I saw the movie Nadine back in 1987, and it's wonderful to see her in another romantic comedy.  Even better this time, because there isn't a bunch of swearing.  I think the last good comedy I saw her in was My Stepmother is An Alien, and that was laugh-out-loud funny too.  This one's been long overdue, and she is just wonderful in it as Pink Lady sales rep Harmony Jones.  I would also like to point out that the woman is still a gorgeous knockout for her age--even better than most of today's younger starlets.  Her character is amusingly glam looking, yet clean cut, completely feminine, and that's what makes her comedic performance twice as good.  Corbett makes a handsome match for her as he, as well as the FBI, chases her around the country--both of them driving great looking convertibles--and the romance has a sweet clean, almost yesteryear appeal that you won't be afraid to let your older relatives watch.Joel Zwick came up with a great concept here; Elvis impersonators getting killed off at random in some very silly and hilarious ways everytime Harmony gets within 3 feet of them, and a love affair Harmony keeps running from because she thinks Corbett is another Elvis impersonator when, in fact, it's his estranged wife (Denise Richards).  I have to admit I wasn't expecting much when I bought it off the bargain rack, but was pleasantly surpirsed last night.  It's not deep, it's not earth shattering, but it's the most clean fun I've had in a long time, and I recommend it highly no matter what your age.  Also, if you like Basinger in comedy roles using her natural Georgia-born accent, you will like her and Jeff Bridges in Nadine.",4,"Total Fun, Even if You're Not an Elvis Fan.",1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,2163,"['did', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'bought', 'yesterday', 'writing', '5', 'bucks', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'found', 'laughing', 'lot', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'not', 'be', 'Elvis', 'fan', 'even', 'are', 'admit', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'knockoffs', 'King', 'running', 'around', 'lots', 'truly', 'as', 'bad', 'what', 'are', 'portrayed', 'offering', 'Basinger', 'character', 'end', 'probably', 'not', 'too', 'happy', 'it.I', 'became', 'Basinger', 'fan', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'Nadine', 'back', '1987', 'wonderful', 'see', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Even', 'better', 'time', ""n't"", 'bunch', 'swearing', 'think', 'last', 'good', 'comedy', 'saw', 'was', 'My', 'Stepmother', 'Alien', 'was', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'too', 'one', 'been', 'long', 'overdue', 'just', 'wonderful', 'Pink', 'Lady', 'sales', 'rep', 'Harmony', 'Jones', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'woman', 'still', 'gorgeous', 'knockout', 'age', 'even', 'better', 'most', 'today', 'younger', 'starlets', 'character', 'amusingly', 'glam', 'looking', 'clean', 'cut', 'completely', 'feminine', 'what', 'comedic', 'performance', 'twice', 'as', 'good', 'Corbett', 'handsome', 'match', 'as', 'well', 'FBI', 'country', 'driving', 'great', 'looking', 'convertibles', 'romance', 'sweet', 'clean', 'almost', 'yesteryear', 'appeal', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'let', 'older', 'relatives', 'watch.Joel', 'Zwick', 'came', 'up', 'great', 'concept', 'here', 'Elvis', 'impersonators', 'getting', 'killed', 'off', 'random', 'very', 'silly', 'hilarious', 'ways', 'everytime', 'Harmony', '3', 'feet', 'love', 'affair', 'Harmony', 'running', 'Corbett', 'Elvis', 'impersonator', 'when', 'fact', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'have', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'when', 'bought', 'off', 'bargain', 'rack', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surpirsed', 'last', 'night', 'not', 'deep', 'not', 'earth', 'shattering', 'most', 'clean', 'fun', ""'ve"", 'had', 'long', 'time', 'recommend', 'highly', 'matter', 'what', 'age', 'Also', 'like', 'Basinger', 'comedy', 'roles', 'using', 'natural', 'Georgia-born', 'accent', 'will', 'like', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Nadine']",Elvis Has Left The Building

But it doesn't seem to have a movie about Elvis, without his songs in the film, and this movie doesn't fail on it, and there are other people even singing his famous tunes. And with the anniversity of his death coming up, this might just be the thing for you Elvis fans to watch, if you are looking to watch either an Elvis Presley related movie for the first time, or any Elvis Presley films, but I am sure that you would even enjoy some of the older Elvis Presley related films that are out there if you are one. The movie opens, with Young Harmony Jones (Madison McReynolds) in Memphis 1968 with the real Elvis Presley (Gil McKinney), as he is dring her home, and now it is flashed to the present. Now Harmony Jones (Kim Basinger) feels that she is cursed around Elvis impersonators, because when she is around them, they are seem to mysterious die around her, and when she meets a man (John Corbett) whom she mistakes for another one, she tires to avoid him as possible, but she doesn't know that he has to pick up that Elvis suit for his wife, so they they can get a dirvoce, and in order for that to happen, he has to hand deliver to Las Vegas, and meet her there, so they can get dirvoced, but just wait until you see what happens to him, on the jorney to Las Vegas, which I would hate to spoil for you, and I won't, so you will have to watch the film for yourself.

914404,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0009W5KHM,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 4]","You may not remember his name, but Zoel Zwick is the guy who directed a big hit named 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding.'  All right, now you know it, and 'Elvis Has Left the Building' is his follow-up, which was released straight-to-video in America.  If you never heard about the film, it's no surprise because, for all good acting from the stars, the film is embarrassingly bad.The comedy features Kim Basinger and John Corbett.  Basinger, clad in pink, is delightful to see as Harmony Jones, cosmetic saleslady of Pink Lady, who travels around riding a pink cadillac.  The life of Harmony has been stragely linked to Elvis Presley, but today troubles seem to follow her everywhere, for every time Harmony meets Elvis impersonaters, they all drop dead in ridiculously silly way.So, while FBI chases the lady in pink, Miles Taylor, bored excetive of advertizement company, happens to meet her, and falls in love.  Harmony also likes him, but after misunderstanding that Taylor is another Elvis lookalike (meaning another dead body), Harmony runs away.  In this way, Taylor and FBI chases her, and the story finally leads the characters to Las Vegas, where a convention for Elvis impersonaters is going to be held.The concept is silly, but not bad itself.  The problem is how to put it into practice.  Though the two stars are very charming and likable, the inept direction killed the joyfully romantic mood between them, which is the greatest thing in the film.  Instead, director throws so many unnecessary elements into the film -- too many flashbacks about Harmony's childhood, unfunny conversations over phone between Corbett and Sean Astin (yes, that's him from 'LOTR'); simply annoying Denise Richards wearing Elvis-wig (I'm not kidding); and awfully familiar 'comic' dialogues between two FBIs, or a gay receptionaist and them.  It is unaccountable that while the film insists on showing these scenes, none of which are particularly good, John Corbett has to spend considerable time in a car trunk (don't as me how).[CAMEO of TOM HANKS!!!] There are some cameos, and all of them are funny -- see Richard Kind as 'Burning Elvis', David Leisure as 'Hole-in-the-Head Elvis,' and Tom Hanks as 'Letterbox Elvis.'  Hanks appears only twice, second time during the end credits, so don't miss it.  Plus, guest appearances from Pat Morita, Angie Dickinson, and Annie Potts.Besides the natural charms of Basinger and Corbett, and the film's sporadically funny moments, the soundtrack is wonderful, which includes lots of Elvis songs.  Some are original versions, some remixed-originals, others covers, and all fantastic.If you like Kim Basinger, you might find the film pretty good with her delectable comic acting.  If only the film's director had decided on making much use of her talent.",2,Charming Basinger and Corbett Couldn't Save the Mess,1126396800,"09 11, 2005",2005,2781,"['may', 'not', 'remember', 'name', 'Zoel', 'Zwick', 'guy', 'who', 'directed', 'big', 'hit', 'named', ""'My"", 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'right', 'now', 'know', 'Has', 'Left', 'Building', 'follow-up', 'was', 'released', 'straight-to-video', 'America', 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'surprise', 'because', 'good', 'acting', 'stars', 'film', 'embarrassingly', 'bad.The', 'comedy', 'features', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'John', 'Corbett', 'Basinger', 'clad', 'pink', 'delightful', 'see', 'Harmony', 'Jones', 'cosmetic', 'saleslady', 'Pink', 'Lady', 'who', 'riding', 'pink', 'cadillac', 'life', 'Harmony', 'been', 'stragely', 'linked', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'today', 'troubles', 'seem', 'follow', 'everywhere', 'time', 'Harmony', 'meets', 'Elvis', 'impersonaters', 'drop', 'dead', 'ridiculously', 'silly', 'way.So', 'FBI', 'lady', 'pink', 'Miles', 'Taylor', 'bored', 'excetive', 'advertizement', 'company', 'meet', 'love', 'Harmony', 'also', 'misunderstanding', 'Taylor', 'Elvis', 'lookalike', 'meaning', 'dead', 'body', 'Harmony', 'away', 'way', 'Taylor', 'FBI', 'story', 'finally', 'characters', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'where', 'convention', 'Elvis', 'impersonaters', 'going', 'be', 'held.The', 'concept', 'silly', 'not', 'bad', 'problem', 'how', 'put', 'practice', 'two', 'stars', 'are', 'very', 'charming', 'likable', 'inept', 'direction', 'killed', 'joyfully', 'romantic', 'mood', 'greatest', 'thing', 'film', 'Instead', 'director', 'throws', 'so', 'many', 'unnecessary', 'elements', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'flashbacks', 'Harmony', 'childhood', 'unfunny', 'conversations', 'phone', 'Corbett', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'yes', ""'LOTR"", 'simply', 'annoying', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'wearing', 'Elvis-wig', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'awfully', 'familiar', ""'comic"", 'dialogues', 'two', 'FBIs', 'gay', 'receptionaist', 'unaccountable', 'film', 'showing', 'scenes', 'none', 'are', 'particularly', 'good', 'John', 'Corbett', 'spend', 'considerable', 'time', 'car', 'trunk', 'do', ""n't"", 'how', '[', 'CAMEO', 'TOM', 'HANKS', ']', 'are', 'cameos', 'are', 'funny', 'see', 'Richard', 'Kind', ""'Burning"", 'Elvis', 'David', 'Leisure', ""'Hole-in-the-Head"", 'Elvis', 'Tom', 'Hanks', ""'Letterbox"", 'Elvis', 'Hanks', 'only', 'twice', 'second', 'time', 'end', 'credits', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'Annie', 'Potts.Besides', 'natural', 'charms', 'Basinger', 'Corbett', 'film', 'sporadically', 'funny', 'moments', 'soundtrack', 'wonderful', 'lots', 'Elvis', 'songs', 'are', 'original', 'versions', 'remixed-originals', 'others', 'covers', 'fantastic.If', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'might', 'find', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'delectable', 'comic', 'acting', 'only', 'film', 'director', 'had', 'decided', 'making', 'much', 'use', 'talent']",Elvis Has Left The Building
914405,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B0009W5KHM,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[2, 6]","I was surprised to see this DVD, because it has probably never been released in theaters dued to it's low budget and weak screenplay. I had to see it for the simple reason that I am a die-hard Kim Basinger fan, and her last role in The Door in The Floor totally broke my heart! This is certainly a bad choice of follow-up made by the everlasting screen goddess.In this film, she plays a travelling cosmetics bussiness woman(Harmony Jones) who had an encounter with young Elvis when she was a little girl, and they had a memorable conversation together. One day, she witnessed a drunken Elvis impersonator accidentally burnt to death in a hotel room, and in panic she vanished from the scene. Along the road, she had two more encounters with Elvis impersonators whom also died from accidents in her presence. She was horrified and thought she was bad luck or something, and wanted to avoid all things Elvis. Meanwhile, the police are investigating the mysterious deaths of the three impersonators, with some small evidence left behind by Harmony. At the same time, Harmony meets a handsome stranger(John Corbett) in a hotel and he instantly had a crush on her. She didn't want to get involved with him, because he was delivering an Elvis Costume to his soon to be ex-wife. Harmony is confused and terrified by all the chaotic things, and she must summon her courage to figure if it was Elvis' spirit at work in attempt to prevent the growing number of people from impersonating him, and can she deliver herself to the man of her dream and walk away without Elvis Phobia?Kim Basinger anchors the film with a decent comic performance, and her Tennesse accent is quite impressive. It is not her forte to do goofy comedies, especially when she's so beautiful as Pink Lady in this movie. There was very little chemistry between Corbett and her, and there romantic plot is so choppy and under developed. Lets hope her next film will be a heavy duty drama or thriller again.",2,Not My Kind of Kim Basinger.,1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,1966,"['was', 'surprised', 'see', 'DVD', 'probably', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'theaters', 'dued', 'low', 'budget', 'weak', 'screenplay', 'had', 'see', 'simple', 'reason', 'am', 'die-hard', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'fan', 'last', 'role', 'Door', 'Floor', 'totally', 'broke', 'heart', 'certainly', 'bad', 'choice', 'follow-up', 'made', 'everlasting', 'screen', 'goddess.In', 'film', 'travelling', 'cosmetics', 'bussiness', 'woman', 'Harmony', 'Jones', 'who', 'had', 'encounter', 'young', 'Elvis', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'had', 'memorable', 'conversation', 'together', 'One', 'day', 'witnessed', 'drunken', 'Elvis', 'impersonator', 'accidentally', 'death', 'hotel', 'room', 'panic', 'vanished', 'scene', 'road', 'had', 'two', 'more', 'encounters', 'Elvis', 'impersonators', 'whom', 'also', 'died', 'accidents', 'presence', 'was', 'horrified', 'thought', 'was', 'bad', 'luck', 'something', 'wanted', 'avoid', 'things', 'Elvis', 'Meanwhile', 'police', 'are', 'investigating', 'mysterious', 'deaths', 'three', 'impersonators', 'small', 'evidence', 'left', 'behind', 'Harmony', 'same', 'time', 'Harmony', 'handsome', 'stranger', 'John', 'Corbett', 'hotel', 'instantly', 'had', 'crush', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'involved', 'was', 'delivering', 'Elvis', 'Costume', 'soon', 'be', 'ex-wife', 'Harmony', 'confused', 'terrified', 'chaotic', 'things', 'must', 'summon', 'courage', 'figure', 'was', 'Elvis', 'spirit', 'work', 'attempt', 'prevent', 'growing', 'number', 'people', 'impersonating', 'can', 'deliver', 'man', 'dream', 'walk', 'away', 'Elvis', 'Phobia', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'film', 'decent', 'comic', 'performance', 'Tennesse', 'accent', 'quite', 'impressive', 'not', 'forte', 'do', 'goofy', 'comedies', 'especially', 'when', 'so', 'beautiful', 'Pink', 'Lady', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'chemistry', 'Corbett', 'there', 'romantic', 'plot', 'so', 'choppy', 'developed', 'Lets', 'hope', 'next', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'heavy', 'duty', 'drama', 'thriller', 'again']",Elvis Has Left The Building
