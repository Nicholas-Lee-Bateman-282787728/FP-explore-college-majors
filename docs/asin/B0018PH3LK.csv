I love her work, but not enough films with her playing good roles - the movie didn't do her any justice by having her play a role with another woman. The movie overall has a great cast. If you have kids, I'd suggest not allowing them to see this. Also, check out the music in the film - I always wait until the end and jot them all down... and usually the soundtracks are missing the good songs - so it's off to iTunes or amazon.com to download. If you are a Selma Blair fan - or a fan of any of these actors/actresses - check out the film. Hope to see Selma in more upcoming films where she can use her talent.",3,"Selma can act, but didn't need to go this far",1240531200,"04 24, 2009",2009,741,"['do', ""n't"", 'often', 'get', 'see', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'play', 'good', 'roles', 'took', 'front', 'center', 'film', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'acting', 'love', 'work', 'not', 'enough', 'films', 'playing', 'good', 'roles', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'having', 'play', 'role', 'woman', 'movie', 'overall', 'great', 'cast', 'have', 'kids', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'not', 'allowing', 'see', 'Also', 'check', 'music', 'film', 'always', 'wait', 'end', 'jot', 'down', 'usually', 'soundtracks', 'are', 'missing', 'good', 'songs', 'iTunes', 'amazon.com', 'download', 'are', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'fan', 'fan', 'actors/actresses', 'check', 'film', 'Hope', 'see', 'Selma', 'more', 'upcoming', 'films', 'where', 'can', 'use', 'talent']",Purple Violets

It seems to dwell terribly heavily on things like the inability of people to forgive and move on, the inability of the writers to get back to what works for them, and the inability of people to be happy.

1160697,A13AB48ZJZF5YE,B0018PH3LK,"Dougie Quick ""Dougie Quick""","[1, 4]","I just now finished viewing this film and first of all I have to admit that although being repulsed by the straw man sort of character created for the part of the husband, I remained curious enough to watch it through.  A chick flick that employs characters of upscale New York yuppie and artist types entertwangled ... I guess I'm supposed to believe that these sorts actually exist outside romantic comedy films. Whatever, I guess if you say so, my only visits were as a child or brief  waits for connecting flights so I am unqualified to say who should be how there.  However, the hand picked throw away husband I know is totally dishonest in New York or anywhere! I can't even squint back the nine years they were supposedly wed to envision a man that our lovely wife writer character ever would have even dated much less married! Trust me I am not hazarding this opinion based on his physical appearance,  I gave up long ago trying to understand what women will find as attractive in men but I do know absolutelytootly that these two would never happen ... well unlessA. it was somewhere with arranged marriage or B. she was a gal with some really deep seated head case issues ... which obviously she is neither. I believe the writer(s) of this screenplay felt somehow forced into such a severe ""straw man"" sort of match up constructed simply to be worthy of disposal. Neccessary today because of societies hearty desire to return the marriage institution to something again sacred.  I see much disapproval lately of tossing a marriage under the bus mostly to make room for the better model.  So here I see this as a lame attempt for this to somehow work for majority audience approval, But any chance at that requires a disposable spouse to be something so wrong ...like a child molester or wife beater etc but those sorts would distract horribly from a light humor infused romance film. So in my humble opinion the husband character chosen was the clumsy error that crippled this movie right off the starting block.  Take it or leave it but I say we all know in heart of hearts that marriage is a sacred thing, worthy of saving, worthy of sacrifice and not something to toss under the bus for convenience sake (or any sake in my thinking ""what God hath joined together let man not put usunder ..."" etc) Trying wrangle maneuvers to coax audience into relaxing morality is thankfully still a neat trick even in this late hour of man's history, too bad some extra thought was not invested in writing that might have avoided the issue from the start which could have done away with the completely unbelievable husband match up right from the start ... I feel for the actress trying to convince us that she is against breaking it off with hubby. With something morally acceptable and believeable this film could easily have gained the momentum to be a 4 or 5 star chick flick (which is one anyone will enjoy seeing even over and over again) ...but sadly ...

1160698,A38M4BOJ8XXH1X,B0018PH3LK,"Flippy ""Buchlieber""","[7, 8]","Imagine a Woody Allen film without Jazz music, without references to Dostoevsky, Nietzsche and the Marx Brothers, without existential questioning but with similar themes - broken marriages, second chances - and some similar characters (there is usually a hysterical woman in a Woody Allen film and Purple Violets has one as well).Edward Burns, I feel, is the next director to keep an eye on. The film's plot is relatively straight-forward: two guys (Burns, Wilson), two girls (Messing, Blair), they used to know each other, are slowly coming back into each other's lives. The two guys have been friends for a long time, the two girls have been friends for a long time. Reconciliation, being true to yourself... other themes which emerge making the film lovely, solid and very approachable.I would guest 65% of the film is devoted to Blair and Wilson's characters whereas Messing and Burns follow-through with some comedic moments. He is a recovering alcoholic, trying to put the past right and she won't forgive him for the way he was. So the sexual tension proves to bring a good balance to the depth and romance between Blair and Wilson.If you enjoy Woody Allen or previous films by Burns (She's The One, The Brothers McMullen) you will enjoy this one. He has the pace and tone of Allen but he is becoming more of his own. I was impressed with the pace, the authenticity of emotions and the nuances. It doesn't offer typical Hollywood bullsh-t - it offers more and is probably more genuine and truer to life than the formulaic tripe slipping across our movie theatre  screens.Definitely worth a look.",4,A Solid Film,1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,1602,"['Imagine', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'Jazz', 'music', 'references', 'Dostoevsky', 'Nietzsche', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'existential', 'questioning', 'similar', 'themes', 'broken', 'marriages', 'second', 'chances', 'similar', 'characters', 'usually', 'hysterical', 'woman', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'Purple', 'Violets', 'one', 'as', 'well', '.Edward', 'Burns', 'feel', 'next', 'director', 'keep', 'eye', 'film', 'plot', 'relatively', 'straight-forward', 'two', 'guys', 'Burns', 'Wilson', 'two', 'girls', 'Messing', 'Blair', 'used', 'know', 'other', 'are', 'slowly', 'coming', 'back', 'other', 'lives', 'two', 'guys', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'long', 'time', 'two', 'girls', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'long', 'time', 'Reconciliation', 'being', 'true', 'other', 'themes', 'emerge', 'making', 'film', 'lovely', 'solid', 'very', 'approachable.I', 'would', 'guest', '65', '%', 'film', 'devoted', 'Blair', 'Wilson', 'characters', 'whereas', 'Messing', 'Burns', 'follow-through', 'comedic', 'moments', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'trying', 'put', 'past', 'right', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'way', 'was', 'sexual', 'tension', 'proves', 'bring', 'good', 'balance', 'depth', 'romance', 'Blair', 'Wilson.If', 'enjoy', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'previous', 'films', 'Burns', 'One', 'Brothers', 'McMullen', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one', 'pace', 'tone', 'Allen', 'becoming', 'more', 'own', 'was', 'impressed', 'pace', 'authenticity', 'emotions', 'nuances', ""n't"", 'offer', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'bullsh-t', 'more', 'probably', 'more', 'genuine', 'truer', 'life', 'formulaic', 'tripe', 'slipping', 'movie', 'theatre', 'screens.Definitely', 'look']",Purple Violets
