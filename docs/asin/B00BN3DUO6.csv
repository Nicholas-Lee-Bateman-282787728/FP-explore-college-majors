The synopsis says 'they are not alone' or some such thing but don't take that to mean a force of any kind or anything supernatural. Its more of a mutant creature feature.

The problems with this one are numerous--the film rarely builds any tension; what the monsters are is never set up or explained; everything you want to see pretty much happens off-screen, probably due to budget issues.  Until very late in the film anyone who is killed is attacked off-screen.  At one point one of the daughters manages to kill a monster but the monster is completely off-screen the entire time and even after it's dead we still don't get to see it.  Towards the end of the movie we do get to see the monsters a little but since no explanation is given regarding their nature or origin it basically feels like you're watching a really bad werewolf movie by people who don't know anything about werewolves.  Nailbiter had a lot of potential but the execution is bad on pretty much every level from the overwrought performances to the flat direction to the barely even there special effects.

At the time, I didn't realize they had a distributor already, so imagine my joy when I realized it was Lionsgate. The company has a true hit on their hands with this one. This is a top-notch horror flick that will have you squirming in your seat and begging for more!This film is amazing, from start to finish. It is visually excellent, the writing is sharp, and the suspense is so tight that you could play it like a guitar. In short, this is an amazing jaunt into horror that fans of the genre will love.NAILBITER has some astounding visual effects for being a lower-budget film. The CG used for the twister meshes perfectly with the physical environment, creating a believable and heart-pounding setting. The creature effects are nice, too; they are original and terrifying, two attributes that create a truly compelling monster.But the true winner here is the story. Director Patrick Rea creates a new Midwestern mythology for a creature straight out of our nightmares. Granted, the explanation behind what is really going on is vague, however I find this actually works for the film. It helps to create the tension onscreen, and it also leaves the viewer with an immense sense of unease as the credits roll.NAILBITER is epic in scope and I love how the movie ends, with leaving potential for a sequel. I would love to revisit this world again and maybe have the father visit Wellsville on a quest for revenge. I highly recommend this one and suggest you check it out soon. This film should appeal to horror fans in general, especially those of you who prefer creature-features.
