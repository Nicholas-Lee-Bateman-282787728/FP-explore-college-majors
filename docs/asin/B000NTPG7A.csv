1060500,A2YM0JQI2IO0VS,B000NTPG7A,"B. Berthold ""brad13""","[2, 2]","`American Pastime` revives a sorrowful chapter in American history: the ignoble internment of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War.  After Pearl Harbor, Japanese-Americans were wrongly vilified as potential traitors, stripped of their civil rights and hoarded into concentration camps throughout the western United States.  Such a shameful episode in our past finally receives worthy treatment in Desmond Nakano`s well-crafted film.  Rather than show the indignities faced by Japanese-Americans in a documentary form, `American Pastime` concentrates instead on the dynamics of an average family caught up in the post-Pearl Harbor paranoia that gave rise to such camps.The film follows the misfortunes of the Nomura family, a solidly middle class family from East Los Angeles.  One minute, the family is celebrating with neighbors, the next, they are having to abandon their homes, soon to be shuttled off to eastern Utah.  The couple`s two sons are as American as can be, listening to Big Band jazz and playing baseball.The film does a remarkable and subtle job of portraying the hardships faced by the Nisei in their new `homes,` the `assignment process,` the guard towers with machine guns, the barbed wire, the constant invasion of privacy and the draconian measures dealt those who resisted in any way.  Yet, Japanese-Americans neither complained nor protested the awful machinations and deprivations mandated by their government.The father, Kaz (well-played by Japanese actor, Masatoshi Nakamura), is the prime exemplar of such an attitude.  He neither questions the legitimacy of why he is where he is nor protests against it.  Instead, he stoically accepts the situation and determines to make the best of it.  He organizes the internees to improve their barracks, set up schools, and hold dances.  Eventually, he even organizes a camp baseball team.Kaz hopes to recruit his youngest son, Lyle (Aaron Yoo) for the new team.  A promising jazz musician, Lyle refuses to accept his new surroundings.  Instead, he spends his hours practicing his sax and drinking illegal booze with the camp`s wise-guy philosopher.  Lyle refuses his father`s request and instead, plays his sax at the camp dances.  There he gets closer to the camp`s prim and nave music teacher, Katie Burrell (played by the lovely Sarah Drew), daughter of the camp commander, Captain Burrell (Gary Cole).  The blossoming love between these two unlikely candidates is `Pastimes` saving grace.  Instead of presenting a history lesson, the film shows how outside events test the two young lovers and their families.The film hits its climax when Lyle is assaulted by one of the local thugs in a nearby town.  After learning his assailant plays for the town team, Lyle offers to help the camp team in their exhibition match with the locals.  For Lyle, the game means revenge; for his father, it is a chance to show the locals that the internees are as American as they are.The seconds tick down to the inevitable showdown and the film makes the most of its little moments.  This is the strength of `American Pastime.` The film shows how the war brought pain and sacrifice to all Americans.  In one such moment, Captain Burrell, denied a ball career by the war, receives news of his son`s death during a game.  Another powerful scene is when the eldest son, Lane, (a sensitive performance by Leonardo Nam) volunteers for the famed 442nd Regimental Combat Team (most decorated US military unit ever) and is given an emotion wrought send off by the whole camp.  Yet, when he returns minus a leg, his sacrifices are rendered all the more painful when he is shamefully denied a haircut at the local barber shop.With the showdown on the diamond, both the Nisei and the locals gain respect for one another.  While the film follows a tried and true plot scheme of young love threatened by disapproving parents, it manages to engage and convince nonetheless.  With their common bond of music, Lyle and Katie` s love survives.  Through a common love for America`s `pastime,' the locals and the internees finally unite under one flag.  Kudos to director Desmond Nakano for making this unassuming and modest film.  It accomplishes its mission; it educates and entertains at the same time.  Well worth watching.",5,Not forgotten...,1310515200,"07 13, 2011",2011,4273,"['American', 'Pastime', 'sorrowful', 'chapter', 'American', 'history', 'ignoble', 'internment', 'Japanese-Americans', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Japanese-Americans', 'were', 'wrongly', 'vilified', 'potential', 'traitors', 'stripped', 'civil', 'rights', 'hoarded', 'concentration', 'camps', 'western', 'United', 'States', 'shameful', 'episode', 'past', 'finally', 'worthy', 'treatment', 'Desmond', 'Nakano', 's', 'well-crafted', 'film', 'Rather', 'show', 'indignities', 'faced', 'Japanese-Americans', 'documentary', 'form', 'American', 'Pastime', 'concentrates', 'instead', 'dynamics', 'average', 'family', 'caught', 'up', 'post-Pearl', 'Harbor', 'paranoia', 'gave', 'rise', 'such', 'camps.The', 'film', 'misfortunes', 'Nomura', 'family', 'solidly', 'middle', 'class', 'family', 'East', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'One', 'minute', 'family', 'celebrating', 'neighbors', 'next', 'are', 'having', 'abandon', 'homes', 'soon', 'be', 'shuttled', 'off', 'eastern', 'Utah', 'couple', 's', 'two', 'sons', 'are', 'as', 'American', 'can', 'be', 'listening', 'Big', 'Band', 'jazz', 'playing', 'baseball.The', 'film', 'remarkable', 'subtle', 'job', 'portraying', 'hardships', 'faced', 'Nisei', 'new', 'homes', 'assignment', 'process', 'guard', 'towers', 'machine', 'guns', 'barbed', 'wire', 'constant', 'invasion', 'privacy', 'draconian', 'measures', 'dealt', 'who', 'resisted', 'way', 'Japanese-Americans', 'complained', 'protested', 'awful', 'machinations', 'deprivations', 'mandated', 'government.The', 'father', 'Kaz', 'well-played', 'Japanese', 'actor', 'Masatoshi', 'Nakamura', 'prime', 'exemplar', 'such', 'attitude', 'questions', 'legitimacy', 'why', 'where', 'protests', 'Instead', 'stoically', 'situation', 'determines', 'make', 'best', 'internees', 'improve', 'barracks', 'set', 'up', 'schools', 'hold', 'dances', 'Eventually', 'even', 'camp', 'baseball', 'team.Kaz', 'recruit', 'youngest', 'son', 'Lyle', 'Aaron', 'Yoo', 'new', 'team', 'promising', 'jazz', 'musician', 'Lyle', 'accept', 'new', 'surroundings', 'Instead', 'hours', 'practicing', 'sax', 'drinking', 'illegal', 'booze', 'camp', 's', 'wise-guy', 'philosopher', 'Lyle', 'father', 's', 'request', 'instead', 'sax', 'camp', 'dances', 'closer', 'camp', 's', 'prim', 'nave', 'music', 'teacher', 'Katie', 'Burrell', 'played', 'lovely', 'Sarah', 'Drew', 'daughter', 'camp', 'commander', 'Captain', 'Burrell', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'blossoming', 'love', 'two', 'unlikely', 'candidates', 'Pastimes', 'saving', 'grace', 'Instead', 'presenting', 'history', 'lesson', 'film', 'how', 'outside', 'events', 'test', 'two', 'young', 'lovers', 'families.The', 'film', 'climax', 'when', 'Lyle', 'assaulted', 'one', 'local', 'thugs', 'nearby', 'town', 'learning', 'assailant', 'plays', 'town', 'team', 'Lyle', 'help', 'camp', 'team', 'exhibition', 'match', 'locals', 'Lyle', 'game', 'revenge', 'father', 'chance', 'show', 'locals', 'internees', 'are', 'as', 'American', 'are.The', 'seconds', 'tick', 'down', 'inevitable', 'showdown', 'film', 'most', 'little', 'moments', 'strength', 'American', 'Pastime.', 'film', 'how', 'war', 'brought', 'pain', 'sacrifice', 'Americans', 'one', 'such', 'moment', 'Captain', 'Burrell', 'denied', 'ball', 'career', 'war', 'news', 'son', 's', 'death', 'game', 'powerful', 'scene', 'when', 'eldest', 'son', 'Lane', 'sensitive', 'performance', 'Leonardo', 'Nam', 'volunteers', 'famed', '442nd', 'Regimental', 'Combat', 'Team', 'most', 'decorated', 'US', 'military', 'unit', 'ever', 'given', 'emotion', 'wrought', 'send', 'off', 'whole', 'camp', 'when', 'leg', 'sacrifices', 'are', 'rendered', 'more', 'painful', 'when', 'shamefully', 'denied', 'haircut', 'local', 'barber', 'shop.With', 'showdown', 'diamond', 'Nisei', 'locals', 'gain', 'respect', 'one', 'film', 'tried', 'true', 'plot', 'scheme', 'young', 'love', 'threatened', 'disapproving', 'parents', 'engage', 'convince', 'nonetheless', 'common', 'bond', 'music', 'Lyle', 'Katie', 's', 'love', 'survives', 'common', 'love', 'America', 's', 'pastime', 'locals', 'internees', 'finally', 'unite', 'one', 'flag', 'Kudos', 'director', 'Desmond', 'Nakano', 'making', 'unassuming', 'modest', 'film', 'mission', 'same', 'time', 'Well', 'watching']",American Pastime

1060511,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000NTPG7A,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[27, 30]","I wonder if the U.S. government would have interred Japanese-Americans during World War II if Pearl Harbor had not happened, or even if the original plan of the Japanese had succeeded and they had formally declared war right before the attack.  If there had not been a sneak attack and therefore no ""day that will live in infamy,"" would that have changed what happened?  Or was paranoia a necessary ingredient for the government to enact such a racist policy?  ""American Pastime"" engenders such questions because virtually all of the film takes place in one of these interment camps.  The title comes from the fact that the climax of the film is a baseball game between a team of Japanese-Americans from the camp and the local semi-pro team.Lyle Nomura (Aaron Yoo) is so American he plays jazz saxophone.  He also loves baseball and was going to go to college on a baseball scholarship when Pearl Harbor ended that dream.  The Nomura family ends up in the Topaz Relocation Center near Abraham, Utah, and like the rest of the prisoners (they are called that in the film and not detainees) they try to make a new life in the camp.  His brother Lane (Leonardo Nam) gets out of the camp by joining the Army and going off to fight in Europe for the country that has put his family in a camp.  Their father, Kaz (Masatoshi Nakamura), loves baseball as much as he loves America and he sets up a league in the camp.Top billing in the film goes to Gary Cole as Billy Burrell, a guard at Topaz who is hard hitting catcher for the local semi-pro baseball team (I understand Cole is the ""big name"" in the cast, but he should have gone with an ""and"" credit at the end).  Cole's character is not the ultimate villain in the story; that would be the town's barber, Ed Tully (Jon Gries), who is the unrelenting racist in the film.  But Burrell is the pivotal character because he is the one on the fence about the Japanese-Americans, especially after his son is killed in combat in the South Pacific.  However, that does not appear to weigh as much on his mind as the fact that he almost made it to the Major Leagues.  If Tully is the little devil on Burrell's shoulder there is another guard at the camp who is the angelic counterpart because he is the one who notices that the Japanese-Americans serving in the Army in Europe (such as Lane) are making a name for themselves as soldiers.There have been other films set in such camps, such as ""Come See the Paradise"" and ""Snow Falling on Cedars,"" which have primarily been romances set against the war and life in the camps.  ""American Pastime"" does have a pair of young lovers from opposite sides of the fence (literally), but the romance takes a melodramatic term since Lyle falls for Katie (Sarah Drew), Burrell's daughter.  Their fathers go the Montague-Capulet route on the subject, to the displeasure of their offspring and spouses, but the romance becomes a secondary consideration big game (even thought the two families actually manage to run into each other off the field DURING the game).  The game itself is okay; as soon as you see who gets to be home team for this friendly little encounter a baseball fan should be able to figure out how this is going to play out.  However, the movie does manage to come up with a way of making the final play of the game resolve a lot of the film's major issues.I watched this 2007 movie after catching Ken Burns' documentary on PBS about ""The War,"" where the story of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team was a major thread, so it was interesting to know what the charcters are talking about in this movie regarding the high casualties the unit took effecting the rescue of the ""Lost Battalion"" in the Vosges Mountains of France in October 1944. But such things are just a reminder that there is a much larger story out there about what happened to Japanese-Americans during World War II than what this movie can show us.  The term ""concentration camp"" dates back to camp used by the British in South Africa during the Second Boer War.  My understanding is that during World War II the relocation centers where 100,000 American citizens of Japanese decent were sent during World War II were called concentration camps at the time.  Of course, after the war the term became identified with the death camps run by the Nazis in Europe, but when I watch a movie like ""American Pastime"" that reminds us of what we did to our own citizens, I cannot help but think of places like Topaz as concentration camps on American soil.",4,A friendly little baseball game between Americans during World War II,1192233600,"10 13, 2007",2007,4500,"['wonder', 'U.S.', 'government', 'would', 'have', 'interred', 'Japanese-Americans', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'had', 'not', 'happened', 'even', 'original', 'plan', 'Japanese', 'had', 'succeeded', 'had', 'formally', 'declared', 'war', 'right', 'attack', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'sneak', 'attack', 'therefore', 'day', 'will', 'live', 'infamy', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'paranoia', 'necessary', 'ingredient', 'government', 'enact', 'racist', 'policy', 'American', 'Pastime', 'engenders', 'such', 'questions', 'virtually', 'film', 'place', 'one', 'interment', 'camps', 'title', 'fact', 'climax', 'film', 'baseball', 'game', 'team', 'Japanese-Americans', 'camp', 'local', 'semi-pro', 'team.Lyle', 'Nomura', 'Aaron', 'Yoo', 'so', 'American', 'jazz', 'saxophone', 'also', 'baseball', 'was', 'going', 'go', 'college', 'baseball', 'scholarship', 'when', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'ended', 'dream', 'Nomura', 'family', 'up', 'Topaz', 'Relocation', 'Center', 'Abraham', 'Utah', 'rest', 'prisoners', 'are', 'called', 'film', 'not', 'detainees', 'try', 'make', 'new', 'life', 'camp', 'brother', 'Lane', 'Leonardo', 'Nam', 'camp', 'joining', 'Army', 'going', 'off', 'fight', 'Europe', 'country', 'put', 'family', 'camp', 'father', 'Kaz', 'Masatoshi', 'Nakamura', 'baseball', 'as', 'much', 'America', 'up', 'league', 'camp.Top', 'billing', 'film', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Billy', 'Burrell', 'guard', 'Topaz', 'who', 'hard', 'hitting', 'catcher', 'local', 'semi-pro', 'baseball', 'team', 'understand', 'Cole', 'big', 'name', 'cast', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'credit', 'end', 'Cole', 'character', 'not', 'ultimate', 'villain', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'town', 'barber', 'Ed', 'Tully', 'Jon', 'Gries', 'who', 'unrelenting', 'racist', 'film', 'Burrell', 'pivotal', 'character', 'one', 'fence', 'Japanese-Americans', 'especially', 'son', 'killed', 'combat', 'South', 'Pacific', 'However', 'not', 'appear', 'weigh', 'as', 'much', 'mind', 'fact', 'almost', 'made', 'Major', 'Leagues', 'Tully', 'little', 'devil', 'Burrell', 'shoulder', 'guard', 'camp', 'who', 'angelic', 'counterpart', 'one', 'who', 'Japanese-Americans', 'serving', 'Army', 'Europe', 'such', 'Lane', 'are', 'making', 'name', 'soldiers.There', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'films', 'set', 'such', 'camps', 'such', 'Come', 'See', 'Paradise', 'Snow', 'Falling', 'Cedars', 'have', 'primarily', 'been', 'romances', 'set', 'war', 'life', 'camps', 'American', 'Pastime', 'have', 'pair', 'young', 'lovers', 'opposite', 'sides', 'fence', 'literally', 'romance', 'melodramatic', 'term', 'Lyle', 'Katie', 'Sarah', 'Drew', 'Burrell', 'daughter', 'fathers', 'go', 'Montague-Capulet', 'route', 'subject', 'displeasure', 'offspring', 'spouses', 'romance', 'secondary', 'consideration', 'big', 'game', 'even', 'thought', 'two', 'families', 'actually', 'manage', 'run', 'other', 'field', 'DURING', 'game', 'game', 'okay', 'as', 'soon', 'see', 'who', 'be', 'home', 'team', 'friendly', 'little', 'encounter', 'baseball', 'fan', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'going', 'play', 'out', 'However', 'movie', 'manage', 'come', 'up', 'way', 'making', 'final', 'play', 'game', 'resolve', 'lot', 'film', 'major', 'issues.I', 'watched', '2007', 'movie', 'catching', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'documentary', 'PBS', 'War', 'where', 'story', '442nd', 'Regimental', 'Combat', 'Team', 'was', 'major', 'thread', 'was', 'interesting', 'know', 'what', 'charcters', 'are', 'talking', 'movie', 'regarding', 'high', 'casualties', 'unit', 'took', 'effecting', 'rescue', 'Lost', 'Battalion', 'Vosges', 'Mountains', 'France', 'October', '1944', 'such', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'reminder', 'much', 'larger', 'story', 'there', 'what', 'happened', 'Japanese-Americans', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'what', 'movie', 'can', 'show', 'term', 'concentration', 'camp', 'back', 'camp', 'used', 'British', 'South', 'Africa', 'Second', 'Boer', 'War', 'understanding', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'relocation', 'centers', 'where', '100,000', 'American', 'citizens', 'Japanese', 'decent', 'were', 'sent', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'were', 'called', 'concentration', 'camps', 'time', 'course', 'war', 'term', 'became', 'identified', 'death', 'camps', 'run', 'Nazis', 'Europe', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'American', 'Pastime', 'what', 'did', 'own', 'citizens', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'places', 'like', 'Topaz', 'concentration', 'camps', 'American', 'soil']",American Pastime

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[9, 13]","I guess that was my question when I first read the press release on this entertaining little film about life in the World War II Japanese ""relocation camps"" in Utah. Well, I can't really say they do but the film is still worth recommending, if only because it does a good job of telling the little covered story of life in these ""camps"", which herded everybody of Japanese decent (even a Blck Hawaiian!) into what were virtually upscale concentration camps. These people, many of who were born as American citizens were treated like foreigners because of the color of their skin and their heritage.But back to the film. It revolves around one young man who was destined for college on a scholarship on ""the day that will live in infamy"" - December 7, 1941. We learn that he loved jazz and he shares is love by playing records for his friends and playing saxophone for himself. He also loves baseball, as - until the war - there were many Japanese baseball players.In the camp he meets a local (non-Japanese) girl (the daughter of one of the town's bigots - an all too contrived plot device) and she plays piano. They meet through playing together. But just about then jazz - and music in general disappears completely from the screenplay! Now it's about baseball and the ""big game"" between the Japanese players and the bigoted ""townies"". I won't give more of the plot away except to say that I was disappointed to see the jazz thread not continue.Because there are so few films about this period in time -  ""Come See The Paradise"" is the only other one I know of - this is an important film to see. The ""Making of"" bonus feature (about 25 minutes long) repeats lots of the scenes but also - a bit too briefly - interviews survivors of these camps.).Definitely worth at least a rental.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,Do Baseball and Jazz really mix?,1179878400,"05 23, 2007",2007,1817,"['guess', 'was', 'question', 'when', 'first', 'read', 'press', 'release', 'entertaining', 'little', 'film', 'life', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Japanese', 'relocation', 'camps', 'Utah', 'Well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'do', 'film', 'still', 'worth', 'recommending', 'only', 'good', 'job', 'telling', 'little', 'covered', 'story', 'life', 'camps', 'herded', 'everybody', 'Japanese', 'decent', 'even', 'Blck', 'Hawaiian', 'what', 'were', 'virtually', 'upscale', 'concentration', 'camps', 'people', 'many', 'who', 'were', 'born', 'American', 'citizens', 'were', 'treated', 'foreigners', 'color', 'skin', 'heritage.But', 'back', 'film', 'one', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'destined', 'college', 'scholarship', 'day', 'will', 'live', 'infamy', 'December', '7', '1941', 'learn', 'loved', 'jazz', 'shares', 'love', 'playing', 'records', 'friends', 'playing', 'saxophone', 'also', 'baseball', 'war', 'were', 'many', 'Japanese', 'baseball', 'players.In', 'camp', 'local', 'non-Japanese', 'girl', 'daughter', 'one', 'town', 'bigots', 'too', 'contrived', 'plot', 'device', 'piano', 'meet', 'playing', 'together', 'just', 'then', 'jazz', 'music', 'general', 'disappears', 'completely', 'screenplay', 'Now', 'baseball', 'big', 'game', 'Japanese', 'players', 'bigoted', 'townies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'more', 'plot', 'away', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'see', 'jazz', 'thread', 'not', 'continue.Because', 'are', 'so', 'few', 'films', 'period', 'time', 'Come', 'See', 'Paradise', 'only', 'other', 'one', 'know', 'important', 'film', 'see', 'Making', 'bonus', 'feature', '25', 'minutes', 'long', 'lots', 'scenes', 'also', 'bit', 'too', 'briefly', 'interviews', 'survivors', 'camps', '.Definitely', 'worth', 'least', 'rental.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",American Pastime
