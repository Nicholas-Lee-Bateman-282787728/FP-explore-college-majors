For 14 cents I figured I won't lose much if I don't like it. It was great! I don't really want to say anything about the plot or spoilers, but all I need to say is it is a spectacular drama.

1149506,AUVBEDUTOU6EC,B0015HZA4S,"Joyce A. Gwillim ""BOSS Lady""","[1, 1]","I waited and waited for this particular movie to make it to the DVD circuit.  Why?  It's set in a location that is real and very close to my hometown. Was it worth it?  Well, the story line was rather boring but it was definitely one many experience today.  Especially with the economic situation of the local job market, this movie exhibits how ""lay-offs"" and plant closures, even big time company buy outs,effect the family life style.  The cast for this film was great.  Enough exposure for the newbies to make a name for themselves but also some good local time for the older actors.  Even though the price for this DVD was higher than most, it's worth it.  Perhaps it will someday be available at a cut-rate video shop, I'm happy to have spent both the money and the time to watch it.  Good job to our young director - a small budget to work with still produced a very true and realistic flick.",3,Small town or not - life's woes and heartaches,1214697600,"06 29, 2008",2008,899,"['waited', 'waited', 'particular', 'movie', 'make', 'DVD', 'circuit', 'Why', 'set', 'location', 'real', 'very', 'close', 'hometown', 'Was', 'Well', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'rather', 'boring', 'was', 'definitely', 'one', 'many', 'experience', 'today', 'Especially', 'economic', 'situation', 'local', 'job', 'market', 'movie', 'how', 'lay-offs', 'plant', 'closures', 'even', 'big', 'time', 'company', 'buy', 'outs', 'effect', 'family', 'life', 'style', 'cast', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'Enough', 'exposure', 'newbies', 'make', 'name', 'also', 'good', 'local', 'time', 'older', 'actors', 'Even', 'price', 'DVD', 'was', 'higher', 'most', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'someday', 'be', 'available', 'cut-rate', 'video', 'shop', ""'m"", 'happy', 'have', 'spent', 'money', 'time', 'watch', 'Good', 'job', 'young', 'director', 'small', 'budget', 'work', 'still', 'produced', 'very', 'true', 'realistic', 'flick']",Steel City
1149507,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0015HZA4S,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","***1/2Superior performances are the hallmark of ""Steel City,"" a moody, gritty, low-keyed drama set in the economically depressed area of the Upper Midwest. P.J. Lee (Tom Guiry) is a fitfully employed young man with an assortment of obstacles to overcome: his father's in jail on a vehicular manslaughter charge; his mom's re-married to a cop; his older brother's a philandering jerk whose wife walks out on him; and his girlfriend has a weight problem which makes P.J. reluctant to fully commit to her. He's also coping with the guilt of having been at least partially responsible for the fatal accident that his dad is claiming was all his fault.Though most of the screen time is taken up with the travails that P.J. is facing and the growing up he is forced to do as a result, the movie's true emotional focus is on the lengths a largely absent father will go to in an effort to redeem himself in the eyes of his son - even if that means having to sacrifice his own freedom to bring that redemption about. As the film's writer and director, Brian Jun demonstrates a nice feel for the look and flavor of the movie's wintry locale and for the tempo and rhythm of the characters' lives.""Steel City"" is sure to get lost in the shuffle of bigger and grander independent and not-so-independent films out there, but the authentic performances - by Guiry, John Heard, Raymond J. Barry, Clayne Crawford, Laurie Metcalf (""Roseanne"") and America Ferreira (virtually unrecognizable out of her Ugly Betty get-up) - and sturdy filmmaking make it a movie well worth checking out.",3,simple but affecting working-class drama,1275868800,"06 7, 2010",2010,1566,"['***1/2Superior', 'performances', 'are', 'hallmark', 'Steel', 'City', 'moody', 'gritty', 'low-keyed', 'drama', 'set', 'economically', 'depressed', 'area', 'Upper', 'Midwest', 'P.J', 'Lee', 'Tom', 'Guiry', 'fitfully', 'employed', 'young', 'man', 'assortment', 'obstacles', 'overcome', 'father', 'jail', 'vehicular', 'manslaughter', 'charge', 'mom', 're-married', 'cop', 'older', 'brother', 'philandering', 'jerk', 'wife', 'out', 'girlfriend', 'weight', 'problem', 'P.J', 'reluctant', 'fully', 'commit', 'also', 'coping', 'guilt', 'having', 'been', 'least', 'partially', 'responsible', 'fatal', 'accident', 'dad', 'claiming', 'was', 'fault.Though', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'taken', 'up', 'travails', 'P.J', 'facing', 'growing', 'up', 'forced', 'do', 'result', 'movie', 'true', 'emotional', 'focus', 'lengths', 'largely', 'absent', 'father', 'will', 'go', 'effort', 'redeem', 'eyes', 'son', 'even', 'having', 'sacrifice', 'own', 'freedom', 'bring', 'redemption', 'about', 'film', 'writer', 'director', 'Brian', 'Jun', 'nice', 'feel', 'look', 'flavor', 'movie', 'wintry', 'locale', 'tempo', 'rhythm', 'characters', 'lives', 'Steel', 'City', 'sure', 'get', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'bigger', 'grander', 'independent', 'not-so-independent', 'films', 'there', 'authentic', 'performances', 'Guiry', 'John', 'Heard', 'Raymond', 'J.', 'Barry', 'Clayne', 'Crawford', 'Laurie', 'Metcalf', 'Roseanne', 'America', 'Ferreira', 'virtually', 'unrecognizable', 'Ugly', 'Betty', 'get-up', 'sturdy', 'filmmaking', 'make', 'movie', 'well', 'checking', 'out']",Steel City
