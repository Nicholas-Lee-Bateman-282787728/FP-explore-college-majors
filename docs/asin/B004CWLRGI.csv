In fact, it makes it a richer and more enjoyable experience.  The cast is wonderful.  I had read all the books, and they are following the stories well.  Just a great series.

1396339,AXF5DL845YECC,B004CWLRGI,Elisabetta,"[0, 0]","I have read almost all of Camelleri's books in the &#34;Inspector Montalbano&#34; series, and these DVD movies give the correct feeling about the character of Inspector Montalbano. He has heart and yet at the same time he illustrates unusual intelligence in a policeman-Detective in charge of a small town police force. Most main characters in these type of movies usually take all the credit even when others contribute to solving a crime. Sometimes Inspector Montalbano doesn't even let anyone except the viewer of the DVD know that he has solved the crime. He solves situations taking into consideration every person involved and does the &#34;right thing&#34; whether it is according to the written law or not. The actor chosen to play the role of Inspector Montalbano is superb. Camelleri's books describe Inspector Montalbano's thoughts and internal arguments within &#34;Montalbano 1 and Montalbano 2&#34; which is not done in the DVD's, but the actor manages to show through visual facial expressions or body language as well as dialogue what is happening in Montalbano's mind and emotions. I love Camelleri's books and was not disappointed by the DVD's. In fact after seeing the full set of all episodes of Inspector Montalbano, I decided to buy the few books I have not read yet.",5,"Great Acting, Great Story!",1353196800,"11 18, 2012",2012,1289,"['have', 'read', 'almost', 'Camelleri', 'books', '34', 'Inspector', 'Montalbano', '34', 'series', 'DVD', 'movies', 'give', 'correct', 'feeling', 'character', 'Inspector', 'Montalbano', 'heart', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'unusual', 'intelligence', 'policeman-Detective', 'charge', 'small', 'town', 'police', 'force', 'Most', 'main', 'characters', 'type', 'movies', 'usually', 'take', 'credit', 'even', 'when', 'others', 'contribute', 'solving', 'crime', 'Sometimes', 'Inspector', 'Montalbano', ""n't"", 'even', 'let', 'anyone', 'viewer', 'DVD', 'know', 'solved', 'crime', 'situations', 'taking', 'consideration', 'person', 'involved', '34', 'right', 'thing', '34', 'according', 'written', 'law', 'not', 'actor', 'chosen', 'play', 'role', 'Inspector', 'Montalbano', 'superb', 'Camelleri', 'books', 'describe', 'Inspector', 'Montalbano', 'thoughts', 'internal', 'arguments', '34', 'Montalbano', '1', 'Montalbano', '2', '34', 'not', 'done', 'DVD', 'actor', 'show', 'visual', 'facial', 'expressions', 'body', 'language', 'as', 'well', 'dialogue', 'what', 'happening', 'Montalbano', 'mind', 'emotions', 'love', 'Camelleri', 'books', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'fact', 'seeing', 'full', 'set', 'episodes', 'Inspector', 'Montalbano', 'decided', 'buy', 'few', 'books', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'yet']",Detective Montalbano: Episodes 13-15

1396342,A3RMEU4GNP60BM,B004CWLRGI,"Sussman ""Sussman""","[8, 8]","Our Inspector Salvo Montalbano, who works in the fictional town of ""Vig&agrave;ta"", in the equally fictional district of ""Montelusa"" in Sicily. Where the Sun is bright and life treads at a different pace, amongst classic bleached white villages and towns that would look out of place in a tourist guide book. In this almost Mediterranean idle there is darkness, decay and at times murder.He and the members of Vigata's small police force, namely Mim&igrave; Augello, Montalbano's second-in-charge, Fazio, Gallo, Galluzzo and the incredibly stupid yet very likeable Catarella, who mans the station's phones, among other minor tasks. While his whole team have suffered from his out bursts, and sometime strange management style he cares for them and in turn they are all very loyal to him, none more so than his girlfriend of 8 plus years. Salvo is a foodie, with a passion, and he rarely permits anything to get between him and good meal, including other social commitments. He is also an avid swimmer; so much so, his apartment is set on the beach front. While his girlfriend, Livia, has to compete with his detective work, we find in the latter series that he will take Livia on a short romantic holiday, although he is using this pretext to further his investigations. He also brings the new love of his life, in the form of a big black shaggy dog. As it turns out, this dog is the key to his latest case.Luca Zingaretti who plays the major role really brings the detective to life; his characterisation for me is spot on. His case work always varied, and never what you would expect to happen happens - there are red herrings and misdirection!In Salvo's work nothing is black and white; mainly his cases are in the grey zone. As one reviewer put it his cases do not have happy endings, while his investigations sometimes leads to organized crime, his stories rarely get totally focused on the Mafia rather they are part of the landscape and environment of where he works in and around.The last few years have seen a plethora of foreign detective series from around Europe each series of any real credit brings fresh cultural nuances, behaviour and identity of their own. After years of British and American detective series these shows, are like a new revelation. While some may hate subtitles I can assure you that to see and hear these shows as they were originally broadcast is always best and I find them all the more enjoyable.",5,"Montalbano is engaging- honest, decent, loyal & has his own way of doing things",1355443200,"12 14, 2012",2012,2435,"['Inspector', 'Salvo', 'Montalbano', 'who', 'fictional', 'town', 'Vig', 'agrave', 'ta', 'equally', 'fictional', 'district', 'Montelusa', 'Sicily', 'Where', 'Sun', 'bright', 'life', 'treads', 'different', 'pace', 'amongst', 'classic', 'bleached', 'white', 'villages', 'towns', 'would', 'look', 'place', 'tourist', 'guide', 'book', 'almost', 'Mediterranean', 'idle', 'darkness', 'decay', 'times', 'murder.He', 'members', 'Vigata', 'small', 'police', 'force', 'namely', 'Mim', 'igrave', 'Augello', 'Montalbano', 'second-in-charge', 'Fazio', 'Gallo', 'Galluzzo', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'yet', 'very', 'likeable', 'Catarella', 'who', 'station', 'phones', 'other', 'minor', 'tasks', 'whole', 'team', 'have', 'suffered', 'out', 'bursts', 'sometime', 'strange', 'management', 'style', 'turn', 'are', 'very', 'loyal', 'none', 'more', 'so', 'girlfriend', '8', 'years', 'Salvo', 'foodie', 'passion', 'rarely', 'anything', 'get', 'good', 'meal', 'including', 'other', 'social', 'commitments', 'also', 'avid', 'swimmer', 'so', 'much', 'apartment', 'set', 'beach', 'front', 'girlfriend', 'Livia', 'compete', 'detective', 'work', 'find', 'latter', 'series', 'will', 'take', 'Livia', 'short', 'romantic', 'holiday', 'using', 'pretext', 'further', 'investigations', 'also', 'new', 'love', 'life', 'form', 'big', 'black', 'shaggy', 'dog', 'out', 'dog', 'key', 'latest', 'case.Luca', 'Zingaretti', 'who', 'major', 'role', 'really', 'detective', 'life', 'characterisation', 'spot', 'case', 'work', 'always', 'varied', 'never', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'happen', 'happens', 'are', 'red', 'herrings', 'misdirection', 'Salvo', 'work', 'nothing', 'black', 'white', 'mainly', 'cases', 'are', 'grey', 'zone', 'one', 'reviewer', 'put', 'cases', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'happy', 'endings', 'investigations', 'sometimes', 'organized', 'crime', 'stories', 'rarely', 'get', 'totally', 'focused', 'Mafia', 'rather', 'are', 'part', 'landscape', 'environment', 'where', 'around.The', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'plethora', 'foreign', 'detective', 'series', 'Europe', 'series', 'real', 'credit', 'brings', 'fresh', 'cultural', 'nuances', 'behaviour', 'identity', 'own', 'years', 'British', 'American', 'detective', 'series', 'shows', 'are', 'new', 'revelation', 'may', 'hate', 'subtitles', 'can', 'assure', 'see', 'hear', 'shows', 'were', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'always', 'best', 'find', 'more', 'enjoyable']",Detective Montalbano: Episodes 13-15
