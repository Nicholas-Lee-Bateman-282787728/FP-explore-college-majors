I remember there being controversy about 50 Cent losing a bunch of weight, but I thought the photos were fake for so long that I didn't bother following up to find out it really was for a movie. But that article made me curious about this film so I rented it.And man, was this ever a movie! I really enjoyed it. I started off looking at the film kinda side-eyed when I saw that terribly fake dreadlock wig on 50 Cent's head (reminded me of Shemar Moore's wig in ""Tyler Perry's Diary of a Mad Black Woman"") but the movie got better. Originally I thought 50 Cent could only play the role of himself well (ex. ""Get Rich Or Die Tryin' (Full Screen Edition)"") but he was REALLY good in this film.He plays a star college football player who is trying to make it to the majors when he finds out he has cancer. This isn't just a movie about sports though. It's actually quite political and gets into the problems with the health care system. While watching this film, I kept thinking of an excellent book I recently read called ""Hot Cripple: An Incurable Smart-ass Takes on the Health Care System and Lives to Tell the Tale.""

Mom is Deon's main cheerleader, and dad, who has been there, wants Deon to be a more aggressive ball hog and less of a team player in order to attract the pro scouts. Even at home, Sean (Cedric Sanders) plays second fiddle to the football star. Deon can have any girl he wants, including the girl dating his brother.However...Thing Fall Apart. Deon has the big ""C"" growing in his chest.  Ray Liotta plays the doctor. While the family is in a waiting room, Ray comes in with an x-ray and shows the family the giant tumor in Deon's chest. Radiation and chemo. Dad, concerned about Deon's draft pick, wants to keep a lid on this in order to deceive the NFL. Mom is not crazy about the idea.As Deon's life whittles away, he finds doors that were once opened to him have closed and life without being a football star is hard.
