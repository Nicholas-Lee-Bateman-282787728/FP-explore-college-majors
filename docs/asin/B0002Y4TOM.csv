850343,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0002Y4TOM,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[26, 28]","The first season of this wonderfully rich and vibrant show on The WB was a fine and solid debut. It set things in place that the show will take higher and with even better results. Such is season two for an example. With the addition of a new character, the junior year scored. Opening with ""Sadie, Sadie"" and ""Hammers And Veils"", the two part opener resolves the Lorelei/Max cliffhanger from season one. This was originally aired as a two hour premiere. A great opener. Rory's future educational life and Lorelei's empty nest syndrome is given a foreshadowing in ""The Road Trip To Harvard"". Luke's nephew, the broody and troublesome Jess, debuts in ""Nick & Nora/Sid & Nancy"", after he is sent to live with Luke. He doesn't like anyone...except Rory. He causes some minor mayhem in the delightful ""The Inns And Outs Of Inns"", before turning the town on it's ear when Rory gets hurt in ""Teach Me Tonight"". An ongoing story arc here also concerns Richard and Emily(Edward Herrmann, Kelly Bishop), when Richard goes through a career crisis that we first really learn about in ""Presenting Lorelei Gilmore"", and is further expanded on in ""Help Wanted"", and ""Back In The Saddle Again"". One of the best episodes here is the wintery delight of ""The Bracebridge Dinner"", where Lorelei and Sookie invite friends and family to the inn. ""Lost And Found"" is another highlight, as the season ends with a wedding and a broken heart in ""I Can't Get Started"". There are many more good things here, but too many to write. Like any TV show, every season is filled with some duds. The duds here are ""Red Light On The Wedding Night"", ""There's The Rub"", which has Lorelei and Emily going to a spa for a weekend, and ""Secrets And Loans"", among a few others. The show continues to be one of the most incredibly brilliant and sharpest shows on TV. The dialogue and banter continue to be second to none, and continues to make people wonder where the closet full of Emmy's this show should have won by now are at. The cast is one of the finest ensembles on TV. Lauren Graham continues to be one of the best leading ladies on TV. Her Lorelei is fleshed out and she carries the show with a magnetic presence that cannot be denied. She is a vision of beauty, and an actress of high caliber talent. The same can be said for Alexis Bledel, who continues to be one of the best representations of a young woman on TV. Same goes for Kelly Bishop, who is a fine and elegant actress in her portrayal. Much praise to the rest of the cast and the town's oddball collection of quirky citizens, which includes the likes of Luke, Lane, Miss Patty, Kirk, Taylor, Babbette, and Paris. A fine collection of supporting characters. The show continues to show a truly strong and healthy relationship between mother and daughter, and the nature of their relationship is a lot more common than some people think. Lorelei has proven herself to be a great mother and the proof is in all the good she has done for Rory, and what she has done herself and their lives and done so mostly on her own.

850346,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0002Y4TOM,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[1, 1]","Nominated for 1 Emmy and 1 Golden Globe in its first five seasons, Gilmore Girls has experienced much greater success among TV viewers than among industry critics. In fact, the show is the first script supported by the Family Friendly Forum's script development fund to go on and become a regular television series. Part of an initiative between The WB Network - maker of such hits as Dawson's Creek (1998), Felicity (1998), Angel (1999), and Smallville (2001) - and fellow industry executives, this push for more family-oriented programming resulted in a series showcasing a unique mother-daughter bond and the various people they encounter on their life voyage of discovery. Set in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, Gilmore Girls utilizes many of the same sets as the hit series The Dukes Of Hazzard (1979) - another successful Warner Brothers production from years past...Gilmore Girls is set in a small idyllic community in Connecticut filled with a wide range of diverse characters and eccentric personalities. Against this backdrop, Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) attempts to raise her daughter and best friend, Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), to carve out a better life for herself. Having made a number of youthful mistakes, Lorelai made the decision to raise her daughter by herself at a young age (the same age as Rory when the series begins), and she's bound and determined to make sure that Rory makes better decisions for herself. As Rory prepares to go off to college, she displays many of the same likes and dislikes as her mother - especially when it comes to the opposite sex, and that's what worries Lorelai the most... A borderline soap opera, Gilmore Girls is more of a serial drama that focuses on the love, friendship, and shared growth of a mother and daughter as they live out their dreams in modern day America...The Gilmore Girls (Season 2) DVD features a number of touching episodes including the season premiere ""Sadie, Sadie"" in which Lorelai accepts Max's marriage proposal and tells everyone except her parents the good news. In the meantime, Rory brings Dean to her grandparent's house to celebrate Rory's academic success at Chilton, only to have Richard castigate Dean for his lack of ambition. Meanwhile, Emily is heartbroken when she learns of her daughter's wedding from Sookie instead of Lorelai... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""The Ins and Outs of Inns"" in which Lorelai and Sookie decide to follow their dream to buy and run an inn (but encounter complications in finding the right property), and ""There's the Rub"" in which Emily and Lorelai bond while taking a weekend spa...Below is a list of episodes included on the Gilmore Girls (Season 2) DVD:Episode 22 (Sadie, Sadie)Episode 23 (Hammers and Veils)Episode 24 (Red Light on the Wedding Night)Episode 25 (The Road Trip to Harvard)Episode 26 (Nick & Nora/Sid & Nancy)Episode 27 (Presenting Lorelai Gilmore)Episode 28 (Like Mother, Like Daughter)Episode 29 (The Ins and Outs of Inns)Episode 30 (Run Away, Little Boy)Episode 31 (The Bracebridge Dinner)Episode 32 (Secrets and Loans)Episode 33 (Richard in Stars Hollow)Episode 34 (A-Tisket, A-Tasket)Episode 35 (It Should've Been Lorelai)Episode 36 (Lost and Found)Episode 37 (There's the Rub)Episode 38 (Dead Uncles and Vegetables)Episode 39 (Back in the Saddle Again)Episode 40 (Teach Me Tonight)Episode 41 (Help Wanted)Episode 42 (Lorelai's Graduation Day)Episode 43 (I Can't Get Started)The DVD Report",5,One of TV's best shows...,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,3475,"['Nominated', '1', 'Emmy', '1', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'experienced', 'much', 'greater', 'success', 'TV', 'viewers', 'industry', 'critics', 'fact', 'show', 'first', 'script', 'supported', 'Family', 'Friendly', 'Forum', 'script', 'development', 'fund', 'go', 'become', 'regular', 'television', 'series', 'Part', 'initiative', 'WB', 'Network', 'maker', 'such', 'hits', 'Dawson', 'Creek', '1998', 'Felicity', '1998', 'Angel', '1999', 'Smallville', '2001', 'fellow', 'industry', 'executives', 'push', 'more', 'family-oriented', 'programming', 'resulted', 'series', 'showcasing', 'unique', 'mother-daughter', 'bond', 'various', 'people', 'encounter', 'life', 'voyage', 'discovery', 'Set', 'fictional', 'town', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'Connecticut', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'many', 'same', 'sets', 'hit', 'series', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', '1979', 'successful', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'production', 'years', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'set', 'small', 'idyllic', 'community', 'Connecticut', 'filled', 'wide', 'range', 'diverse', 'characters', 'eccentric', 'personalities', 'backdrop', 'Lorelai', 'Gilmore', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'attempts', 'raise', 'daughter', 'best', 'friend', 'Rory', 'Gilmore', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', 'carve', 'out', 'better', 'life', 'herself', 'Having', 'made', 'number', 'youthful', 'mistakes', 'Lorelai', 'made', 'decision', 'raise', 'daughter', 'herself', 'young', 'age', 'same', 'age', 'Rory', 'when', 'series', 'bound', 'determined', 'make', 'sure', 'Rory', 'better', 'decisions', 'herself', 'Rory', 'prepares', 'go', 'off', 'college', 'many', 'same', 'likes', 'dislikes', 'mother', 'especially', 'when', 'opposite', 'sex', 'what', 'Lorelai', 'most', 'borderline', 'soap', 'opera', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'more', 'serial', 'drama', 'love', 'friendship', 'shared', 'growth', 'mother', 'daughter', 'live', 'out', 'dreams', 'modern', 'day', 'America', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'number', 'touching', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Sadie', 'Sadie', 'Lorelai', 'Max', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'everyone', 'parents', 'good', 'news', 'meantime', 'Rory', 'Dean', 'grandparent', 'house', 'celebrate', 'Rory', 'academic', 'success', 'Chilton', 'only', 'have', 'Richard', 'castigate', 'Dean', 'lack', 'ambition', 'Meanwhile', 'Emily', 'heartbroken', 'when', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'Sookie', 'instead', 'Lorelai', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'include', 'Ins', 'Outs', 'Inns', 'Lorelai', 'Sookie', 'decide', 'follow', 'dream', 'buy', 'run', 'inn', 'encounter', 'complications', 'finding', 'right', 'property', 'Rub', 'Emily', 'Lorelai', 'bond', 'taking', 'weekend', 'spa', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'Episode', '22', 'Sadie', 'Sadie', 'Episode', '23', 'Hammers', 'Veils', 'Episode', '24', 'Red', 'Light', 'Wedding', 'Night', 'Episode', '25', 'Road', 'Trip', 'Harvard', 'Episode', '26', 'Nick', 'Nora/Sid', 'Nancy', 'Episode', '27', 'Presenting', 'Lorelai', 'Gilmore', 'Episode', '28', 'Mother', 'Daughter', 'Episode', '29', 'Ins', 'Outs', 'Inns', 'Episode', '30', 'Run', 'Away', 'Little', 'Boy', 'Episode', '31', 'Bracebridge', 'Dinner', 'Episode', '32', 'Secrets', 'Loans', 'Episode', '33', 'Richard', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'Episode', '34', 'A-Tisket', 'A-Tasket', 'Episode', '35', 'Should', ""'ve"", 'Been', 'Lorelai', 'Episode', '36', 'Lost', 'Found', 'Episode', '37', 'Rub', 'Episode', '38', 'Dead', 'Uncles', 'Vegetables', 'Episode', '39', 'Back', 'Saddle', 'Again', 'Episode', '40', 'Teach', 'Me', 'Tonight', 'Episode', '41', 'Help', 'Wanted', 'Episode', '42', 'Lorelai', 'Graduation', 'Day', 'Episode', '43', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Started', 'DVD', 'Report']",Gilmore Girls: Season 2

Rory finally told Dean that she loves him (I love you, you idiot... funny), and Lorelai had just gotten proposed to through 1,000 yellow lillies, or whatever the flower was...  It looks like a year of love for the Gilmore girls...  But that would be boring...Returning this season are:  Lauren Graham (Lorelai Gilmore), Alexis Bledel (Rory Gilmore), Scott Patterson (Luke Danes), Keiko Agena (Lane Kim), Jared Padalecki (Dean), Kelly Bishop (Emily Gilmore), Edward Hermann (Richard Gilmore), Melissa McCarthy (Sookie St.James) and, Yanic Truesdale as Michel...  And let's welcome newcomer Milo Ventimiglia as the new bad boy nephew of Luke from New York, Jess...Upon watching the first season, I didn't honestly believe that any season could trump it.  The dialogue in this wonderful drama is absolutely magnificent, and delivered perfectly by its incredible cast.  We are rarely left with any dull moments, because as things begin to get happier, something else happens to bring the crew down...  Here's what we get to look forward to:1.  Rory's relationship with Dean...  It seemed like it would be a match made in heaven after Rory declared her love for Dean, until Jess came into town.  While Dean is caring, compassionate, considerate, and a little annoying at times, Jess seems like a breath of fresh air, as despite his attitudinal deficiencies, they seem to be more on the same plane...  The more important question is, will Rory and Dean be able to keep their flamed akindled, or will Jess steal her heart away...2.  Lorelai...  Upon a self-revelation, she decides to break of the wedding with Max Medina last minute, as the girls take an impulsive trip to Harvard.  Boy trauma for Lorelai seems to keep to the down low, until Christopher booms in with news of a new girlfriend...  They seem serious too...  Then again, you never can tell, and on the heels of something magical blooming between Christopher and Lorelai, yet more obstacles get in the way...3.  Richard and Emily.  We all knew that they fought quite a bit, after all, old people set in their ways, not to mention being kind of one-sided, including their absolute adoration of their granddaughter.  But Richard is a little on edge, as things occur between them that may cause problems later on...Let's not also forget to mention Luke's relationship with Jess, which makes for great fun a lot of times, Rory's ascent to her change in character, Sookie & Jackson, adventures in modeling, a huge village sized dinner party complete with horses and boyfriend controversy, newspaper extravaganzas, a luxurious spa visit, Richard in Stars Hollow, and talk of Lorelai and Sookies starting their own inn...This season is full of humor, joy, and tragedy.  It has its plethora of sad moments, and happy moments, and altogether times where you might feel tears beginning to shed from your eyes, not mention yet another cliffhanger ending as we dont' really know what to feel, or what will happen.Buy this...",5,Proud Member of the GG Craze,1105920000,"01 17, 2005",2005,3139,"['Yeah', 'signed', 'up', 'when', 'bought', 'Season', 'One', 'reaffirmed', 'commitments', 'membership', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'Craze', 'when', 'bought', 'season', '2', 'So', 'where', 'did', 'leave', 'off', 'Rory', 'finally', 'told', 'Dean', 'love', 'idiot', 'funny', 'Lorelai', 'had', 'just', 'gotten', 'proposed', '1,000', 'yellow', 'lillies', 'whatever', 'flower', 'was', 'year', 'love', 'Gilmore', 'girls', 'would', 'be', 'boring', 'Returning', 'season', 'are', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'Lorelai', 'Gilmore', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', 'Rory', 'Gilmore', 'Scott', 'Patterson', 'Luke', 'Danes', 'Keiko', 'Agena', 'Lane', 'Kim', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'Dean', 'Kelly', 'Bishop', 'Emily', 'Gilmore', 'Edward', 'Hermann', 'Richard', 'Gilmore', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'Sookie', 'St.James', 'Yanic', 'Truesdale', 'Michel', 'let', 'welcome', 'newcomer', 'Milo', 'Ventimiglia', 'new', 'bad', 'boy', 'nephew', 'Luke', 'New', 'York', 'Jess', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'believe', 'season', 'could', 'trump', 'dialogue', 'wonderful', 'drama', 'absolutely', 'magnificent', 'delivered', 'perfectly', 'incredible', 'cast', 'are', 'rarely', 'left', 'dull', 'moments', 'things', 'begin', 'get', 'happier', 'something', 'else', 'bring', 'crew', 'down', 'Here', 'what', 'get', 'look', 'forward', 'to:1', 'Rory', 'relationship', 'Dean', 'seemed', 'would', 'be', 'match', 'made', 'heaven', 'Rory', 'declared', 'love', 'Dean', 'Jess', 'came', 'town', 'Dean', 'caring', 'compassionate', 'considerate', 'little', 'annoying', 'times', 'Jess', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'attitudinal', 'deficiencies', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'same', 'plane', 'more', 'important', 'question', 'will', 'Rory', 'Dean', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'flamed', 'akindled', 'will', 'Jess', 'steal', 'heart', 'away', '2', 'Lorelai', 'self-revelation', 'break', 'wedding', 'Max', 'Medina', 'last', 'minute', 'girls', 'take', 'impulsive', 'trip', 'Harvard', 'Boy', 'trauma', 'Lorelai', 'keep', 'down', 'low', 'Christopher', 'booms', 'news', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'seem', 'serious', 'too', 'Then', 'again', 'never', 'can', 'tell', 'heels', 'something', 'magical', 'blooming', 'Christopher', 'Lorelai', 'yet', 'more', 'obstacles', 'get', 'way', '3', 'Richard', 'Emily', 'knew', 'fought', 'quite', 'bit', 'old', 'people', 'set', 'ways', 'not', 'mention', 'being', 'kind', 'one-sided', 'including', 'absolute', 'adoration', 'granddaughter', 'Richard', 'little', 'edge', 'things', 'occur', 'may', 'cause', 'problems', 'later', 'Let', 'not', 'also', 'forget', 'mention', 'Luke', 'relationship', 'Jess', 'great', 'fun', 'lot', 'times', 'Rory', 'ascent', 'change', 'character', 'Sookie', 'Jackson', 'modeling', 'huge', 'village', 'sized', 'dinner', 'party', 'complete', 'horses', 'boyfriend', 'controversy', 'newspaper', 'extravaganzas', 'luxurious', 'spa', 'visit', 'Richard', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'talk', 'Lorelai', 'Sookies', 'starting', 'own', 'inn', 'season', 'full', 'humor', 'joy', 'tragedy', 'plethora', 'sad', 'moments', 'happy', 'moments', 'altogether', 'times', 'where', 'might', 'feel', 'tears', 'beginning', 'shed', 'eyes', 'not', 'mention', 'yet', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'dont', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'feel', 'what', 'will', 'happen.Buy']",Gilmore Girls: Season 2
850351,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,B0002Y4TOM,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[2, 2]","After becoming addictive to watching reruns on ABC Family and Soap.net, I stumbled upon the Gilmore Girls season one and two bundled together for under twenty dollars at a Target Store. After quickly going through the first season, a few days later I started watching the second season. A week went by and I had finished watching it. I realized that the series was aimed for a female audience, but for some reason it clicked with me, mostly because I caught Lorelai and Rory constantly drinking coffee, and I have always liked Lauren Graham ever since I saw her in Bad Santa.Season 2 picks up where the first season finale ended, with Lorelai finally saying ""yes"" to Max's marriage proposal and Rory starts up her relationship with Dean again. I found it odd that the first few episodes are set during the summer, as in most TV series the start of season takes place three months later, where the kids are going back to school. The first three episodes involve planning for the upcoming wedding, which never really happens as Lorelai calls it off. The following episode has Rory and her on a road trip to visit Harvard; well it was more like crashing and is my favorite episode now. Lorelai's love life is ignored through most of the season besides from a few scenes with Rory's father who ends up going nowhere. Rory's love life is the man focus as she is torn between her sweetheart Dean and Luke's troubled nephew Jess.Between the smart dialogue, quirky characters, and the coffee drinking, I absolutely love this show, and I regret never watching it during its original run. Luke (the owner of Luke's Diner) is the most relatable character for me. From his casual style, ruddiness/crankiness, and attitude, all in which reminds me of myself, except for his dislike of coffee. Or course I like Lorelai for her smart-ass attitude and Rory's love of books. What I didn't care for was the character Jess, who is just an annoying troublemaker. I was laughing out loud when Luke shoved Jess into the lake.",5,Another Great Season,1337731200,"05 23, 2012",2012,2003,"['becoming', 'addictive', 'watching', 'reruns', 'ABC', 'Family', 'Soap.net', 'stumbled', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'bundled', 'together', 'twenty', 'dollars', 'Target', 'Store', 'quickly', 'going', 'first', 'season', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'started', 'watching', 'second', 'season', 'week', 'went', 'had', 'finished', 'watching', 'realized', 'series', 'was', 'aimed', 'female', 'audience', 'reason', 'clicked', 'mostly', 'caught', 'Lorelai', 'Rory', 'constantly', 'drinking', 'coffee', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'ever', 'saw', 'Bad', 'Santa.Season', '2', 'up', 'where', 'first', 'season', 'finale', 'ended', 'Lorelai', 'finally', 'saying', 'yes', 'Max', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'Rory', 'up', 'relationship', 'Dean', 'again', 'found', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'set', 'summer', 'most', 'TV', 'series', 'start', 'season', 'place', 'three', 'months', 'later', 'where', 'kids', 'are', 'going', 'back', 'school', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'involve', 'planning', 'upcoming', 'wedding', 'never', 'really', 'Lorelai', 'off', 'following', 'episode', 'Rory', 'road', 'trip', 'visit', 'Harvard', 'well', 'was', 'more', 'crashing', 'favorite', 'episode', 'now', 'Lorelai', 'love', 'life', 'ignored', 'most', 'season', 'few', 'scenes', 'Rory', 'father', 'who', 'up', 'going', 'nowhere', 'Rory', 'love', 'life', 'man', 'focus', 'torn', 'sweetheart', 'Dean', 'Luke', 'troubled', 'nephew', 'Jess.Between', 'smart', 'dialogue', 'quirky', 'characters', 'coffee', 'drinking', 'absolutely', 'love', 'show', 'regret', 'never', 'watching', 'original', 'run', 'Luke', 'owner', 'Luke', 'Diner', 'most', 'relatable', 'character', 'casual', 'style', 'ruddiness/crankiness', 'attitude', 'dislike', 'coffee', 'course', 'like', 'Lorelai', 'smart-ass', 'attitude', 'Rory', 'love', 'books', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'character', 'Jess', 'who', 'just', 'annoying', 'troublemaker', 'was', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'when', 'Luke', 'shoved', 'Jess', 'lake']",Gilmore Girls: Season 2

This show couldn't be more perfect.  The cast is tremendous and they all work together with machine-like precision.  Lauren Graham and Kelly Bishop (daughter and mother) are particularly noteworthy because it seems there are many mothers and daughters who have this sort of love-hate relationship, filled with issues that never quite get resolved over the course of years.  Bishop as the rich, pretentiously formal mother is so convincing that I'd probably be visibly shaken were I to see her in jeans in a coffee shop eating bacon and eggs. And Lauren Graham?  What's not to like?  She has given life to one of the truly unique characters in TV history as the daughter who just won't buy into her parents' lifestyle and controlling ways.  She delivers her lines with such rapid-fire perfection that one wonders how she can ever ""come down"" from playing this role for over 100 episodes at this point. (Her character is always drinking strong coffee, which, if it's the real thing, may help explain a few things.) And those cross-references! Strange, exotic trivia comes out of the mouths of some of the characters as fluidly as if they were simply saying, ""Have a nice day.""  That adds an element of fun to the show, in my opinion.  Having just aired their 100th episode in early February 2005, some wonder how long this show can sustain itself.

Too bad Stars Hollow is fictional; otherwise I'd probably move there next week (and try to steal Luke away from Lorelai....but I digress). Simply put: this is good, quality TV. It is unique and fresh. And that's because it's got great writing and great casting/acting and that's something that is hard to find these days. And by the way it's about time those Emmy/Golden Globe people give Lauren Graham her much overdue awards -- there are comedic actresses...and then there is Lauren. She's phenomenal.This second season has some fun bonus features and my personal fave is the guide to Gilmore-isms handbook to help the less-informed decipher those quick asides they regulary toss the viewers' way. Half of the challenge is to catch them since the dialog moves so fast, but even the most informed person will be stumped time to time since the ""isms"" are so random/diverse.This DVD set is worth the small investment because I guarantee you will watch it time and time again, just like the first season.

They share a love for breathless quip-filled conversation and coffee, frequenting Luke's Diner in the downtown of Stars Hollow, their fictitious Connecticut suburb.In Season 1, 16-year-old Rory decides she wants to transfer from the public high school to Chilton, a ritzy private school in Hartford. To make it happen, Lorelai has to make the ultimate sacrifice -- beseech her parents Richard and Emily, with whom she hasn't been on good terms since she announced her teenage pregnancy. Although estranged with Lorelai, the elder Gilmores are more than eager to accept their young granddaughter into their lives. They agree to foot the bill -- on one condition. Both Lorelai and Rory must attend dinner at the elder Gilmores' home every Friday evening.Reluctantly, Lorelai agrees. The resulting Friday night dinners set the stage for much hilarity and snark -- as well as the occasional glimpse into the Gilmores' sad past, hinting at everything that went wrong in their relationship, well before Rory's birth.Also seen on the show are diner proprietor Luke, a quiet, loyal friend to both mother and daughter with a building crush on Lorelai; Lane, the Korean-American daughter of a stern single mother and Rory's best friend; Sookie, chef at the Independence Inn, which Lorelai manages; Kirk, a quirky ""townie"" who mysteriously shows up everywhere anyone's doing anything; dance instructor and romance expert Miss Patty; and many others. Rory's father Christopher is also around sporadically, as he and Lorelai fight an attraction which has intertwined throughout their lives, but never seems to work out.In this season, Rory continues dating Dean, her first serious boyfriend, while fighting an attraction to Luke's bad-boy nephew Jess. Lorelai becomes engaged to Max, a teacher at Chilton. Emily wants Rory to participate in a debutante ball, and Lorelai and Sookie want to realize their dream of opening their own inn.Although the show is supposedly set in Connecticut, the writers and producers never really make that believable to a native (i.e. Rory and Lorelai walking around with thin coats, wide open, supposedly in the middle of winter. Still, I can overlook that -- it's fun having one of my favorite shows set in my own state.

850372,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002Y4TOM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[70, 72]","The second season of ""Gilmore Girls"" is when a lot of things did not happen to Lorelai Gilmore.  It started with Lorelai not marrying Max (""Red Light on the Wedding Night"") and ended with her not marrying Christopher (""I Can't Get Started""), but Sookie got married so at least there was some progress in that area, although the duo's plan to open an inn together hits a major roadblock (""The Ins and Outs of Inns"").  Of course, the most important thing that did not happen to Lorelai was that she manages to really notice Luke despite the fact he is pretty much there in front of her every morning at the diner.  Clearly the creators of ""Gilmore Girls"" remember what happened to ""Moonlighting"" once Dave and Maddie stopped bantering and started kissing and other things, so the agenda is to put off the inevitable for as long as possible.  So even if it is obvious to everyone else in Stars Hollow (to wit, Emily), does not mean that Lorelai has a clue.As for Rory, her junior year at Chilton has its ups and downs. and not just because of Paris.  The ups would be ""The Road Trip to Harvard"" and making her society debut (""Presenting Lorelai Gilmore""), while the downside would be the rift between her and her grandfather because of Dean (""Sadie, Sadie"") and the problems with Dean because of Jess (""There's the Rub"" and ""A-Tisket, A-Tasket"").  If anything, the common denominator is to make sure that none of the Gilmore women are happy, which means Rory is mad at Lorelai for blaming Jess for the accident (""Help Wanted,"" Lorelai is mad at Emily for arranging their going to a spa together (""There's the Rub"") and Emily is mad at Richard for quitting his job without consulting here (""The Bracebridge Dinner"").  What?  You thought Emily was going to be mad at Rory?  Are you kidding?  Have you not been watching this show?For me the fascinating part is watching the yang of Lorelai and Emily's relationship compared to the yin of the Lorelai and Rory dynamic.  For me some of the most memorable moments from season two are when Emily orders Richard to make up with Rory because if their granddaughter ever gets married she to know about it (Lorelai did not tell her parents about her engagement to Max) and the look on her parent's face with Lorelai gets her business school diploma (""Lorelai's Graduation Day"").  But then a good rule of thumb is anytime we see a chink in Emily's armor it is a moment that will be hard to forget.  I am still trying to make up my mind as to whether or not Lorelai has an even more strained relationship with her father than her mother, given his visit to her place of work (""Richard in Stars Hollow"") and her visit to his new office (""Help Wanted"").  I am certainly leaning in that direction, but it is still open to debate.But overall the two emotional highpoints of the second season finding Lorelai giving and then receiving as good as she gets.  The giving happens in ""Teach Me Tonight"" when a totally distraught Lorelai goes after Luke because of the car accident where Rory gets hurt (slightly hurt, but hurt is hurt, and there is a cast on her arm, mister), creating a serious rift in their relationship.  The receiving is two episodes later in ""Lorelai's Graduation Day"" when Rory misses the big event and offers the most high speed combined heartfelt apology and verbal self-flagellation in television history (I agree with her, I think she had a stroke or something).My strong affection for high-speed dialogue can be traced from ""Gilmore Girls"" back to ""Moonlight"" and beyond to ""The Thing From Another World"" and any movie starring Groucho Marx.  Equally as strong is my enjoyment of gratuitous pop culture references, especially as manifested in ""The Simpsons"" and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""  So to have a series that combines both of these elements and provides deleted scenes on the DVD is one of those absolute joys you hear so much about (although my wife is tired of me explaining all of the references, allusions, and impromptu name dropping).  Then again, while I knew from the start that Carole King was singing the show's theme song ""Where You Lead"" with her daughter Louis Goffin, I only recently figure out they had re-recorded the song with some of the lines changed to better fit the show (No, I do not fast forward through the title sequence; I always listen to the song).I am also pleased to see that the ""Gilmore Girls"" is being seen around the world, although I have to wonder how the pop culture references translate into out cultures (I have no doubt people can speak real fast in any language).  But you can see ""Gilmore Girls"" now from Argentina (the current season is on the Warner Channel Thursdays at 21:00 with past seasons shown weekdays at 11:30 and 16:30) to the United Kingdom (Sundays at 18:00 on Nickeloden U.K.).

The small-town humor, the banter between mother and daughter (face to face, not over the phone) and the crazy secondary characters that become less and less present as time goes on.

850376,A7MEOXXTQHRPB,B0002Y4TOM,Marty W. Rhodes,"[0, 1]","I am not the target audience for this show because I am a man but it is fairly well done and there are aspects of it that I like.  The main protagonists are a single mother named Lorelai Gilmore and her 16 year old daughter Rory.  The show chronicles their lives in a small town called Star's Hollow that is full of strange and off-beat characters.  It also deals with their relationship with Lorelai's parents and with some of Rory's classmates and friends at school.Loerlai is portrayed by Loren Graham and she is a complex character.  Lorelai is a relatively young (32) and very attractive single mom who is best friends with her daughter.  She is very much a snarky smart-ass and at times can be very funny.  She is the manager of a local inn and several of the supporting cast members are her employees.  She and Rory are well know and well liked in the town.  But as a man watching the show I had a hard time rooting for Lorelai as a protagonist because she has a very deep character flaw.  She treats all of the men in her life like crap.  It's not that she does not like men.  She likes having them around as long as they are doing things for her and not being in any way inconvenient, but she has no real respect for them and she often treats them very badly.  And with her it is completely a one-way street.  When she treats a man badly she expects him to completely understand her needs and emotions but she feels no obligation to understand, or in some cases even acknowledge, his needs and emotions.  I am giving the show's writers the benefit of the doubt here, by assuming that this character is meant to be seen as flawed in this way, rather than meant to be seen as a &#34;strong woman&#34;.  Even though it was difficult for me to root for Lorelai, I do acknowledge that the show's writers wrote her very consistently and Loren Graham portrayed her consistently true to the way the character was written.I had no such trouble rooting for Lorelai's daughter Rory, portrayed very well by Alexis Bledel.  Despite her mother's poor example, Rory cares very deeply about the needs and emotions of all of her friends and family members, regardless of their sex.  In fact, she agonizes over her boyfriend's feelings.  And she even cares to some degree about the hurt feelings her worst enemies!  If anything this girl is too nice and too empathetic.  Your heart just goes out to her and you can't help but root for her to succeed and find happiness, or at least that was my reaction to her.  It is for this reason that I am willing to give the show's writers the benefit of the doubt on the Lorelai character, because with Rory they clearly demonstrate that they can write an intelligent female who does not treat the males in her life badly.The supporting cast is a mixed bag.  There are those that I despise and think the show would be better off without.  (Babette, Taylor, Sookie, & Jackson).  And those that I think are good and contribute well to the show (Luke, Lane, Michel, Paris, Dean, Tristan, Madeline, Louise, Miss Patty, Kirk, & Rachel).  And those that are themselves a mixed bag and bring both good and bad things to the show (Jess, Lorelai's parents, Christopher, & Max).  Michel, Lane, and Paris, portrayed respectively by Yanic Truesdale, Keiko Agena, and Liza Weil are particularly good and, each in their own way, very unique characters.Overall I thought this was a fairly well done chic show.  I can't give it 4 stars because there were just too many things about it that I did not like but I would give it 3.5 stars if I could because there are some characters in the show that I did like quite a bit.",3,This is definitely a chic show but at least it's a fairly well done one.,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,3635,"['am', 'not', 'target', 'audience', 'show', 'am', 'man', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'are', 'aspects', 'like', 'main', 'protagonists', 'are', 'single', 'mother', 'named', 'Lorelai', 'Gilmore', '16', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Rory', 'show', 'lives', 'small', 'town', 'called', 'Star', 'Hollow', 'full', 'strange', 'off-beat', 'characters', 'also', 'relationship', 'Lorelai', 'parents', 'Rory', 'classmates', 'friends', 'school.Loerlai', 'portrayed', 'Loren', 'Graham', 'complex', 'character', 'Lorelai', 'relatively', 'young', '32', 'very', 'attractive', 'single', 'mom', 'who', 'best', 'friends', 'daughter', 'very', 'much', 'snarky', 'smart-ass', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'manager', 'local', 'inn', 'several', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'employees', 'Rory', 'are', 'well', 'know', 'well', 'liked', 'town', 'man', 'watching', 'show', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'rooting', 'Lorelai', 'protagonist', 'very', 'deep', 'character', 'flaw', 'men', 'life', 'crap', 'not', 'not', 'men', 'having', 'around', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'doing', 'things', 'not', 'being', 'way', 'inconvenient', 'real', 'respect', 'often', 'very', 'badly', 'completely', 'one-way', 'street', 'When', 'man', 'badly', 'completely', 'understand', 'needs', 'emotions', 'obligation', 'understand', 'cases', 'even', 'acknowledge', 'needs', 'emotions', 'am', 'giving', 'show', 'writers', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'here', 'assuming', 'character', 'meant', 'be', 'seen', 'flawed', 'way', 'rather', 'meant', 'be', 'seen', '34', 'strong', 'woman', '34', 'Even', 'was', 'difficult', 'root', 'Lorelai', 'do', 'acknowledge', 'show', 'writers', 'wrote', 'very', 'consistently', 'Loren', 'Graham', 'portrayed', 'consistently', 'true', 'way', 'character', 'was', 'written.I', 'had', 'such', 'trouble', 'rooting', 'Lorelai', 'daughter', 'Rory', 'portrayed', 'very', 'well', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', 'mother', 'poor', 'example', 'Rory', 'very', 'deeply', 'needs', 'emotions', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'regardless', 'sex', 'fact', 'boyfriend', 'feelings', 'even', 'degree', 'hurt', 'worst', 'enemies', 'anything', 'girl', 'too', 'nice', 'too', 'empathetic', 'heart', 'just', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'succeed', 'find', 'happiness', 'least', 'was', 'reaction', 'reason', 'am', 'willing', 'give', 'show', 'writers', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'Lorelai', 'character', 'Rory', 'clearly', 'demonstrate', 'can', 'write', 'intelligent', 'female', 'who', 'not', 'treat', 'males', 'life', 'badly.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'mixed', 'bag', 'are', 'despise', 'think', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'Babette', 'Taylor', 'Sookie', 'Jackson', 'think', 'are', 'good', 'contribute', 'well', 'show', 'Luke', 'Lane', 'Michel', 'Paris', 'Dean', 'Tristan', 'Madeline', 'Louise', 'Miss', 'Patty', 'Kirk', 'Rachel', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'bring', 'good', 'bad', 'things', 'show', 'Jess', 'Lorelai', 'parents', 'Christopher', 'Max', 'Michel', 'Lane', 'Paris', 'portrayed', 'respectively', 'Yanic', 'Truesdale', 'Keiko', 'Agena', 'Liza', 'Weil', 'are', 'particularly', 'good', 'own', 'way', 'very', 'unique', 'characters.Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'chic', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', '4', 'stars', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'would', 'give', '3.5', 'stars', 'could', 'are', 'characters', 'show', 'did', 'quite', 'bit']",Gilmore Girls: Season 2

850385,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0002Y4TOM,Robert Moore,"[4, 4]","One of the inside jokes in SEINFELD was that it was a series in which nothing happened, but in comparison to THE GILMORE GIRLS, SEINFELD can seem like an action series.  Things do happen in THE GILMORE GIRLS, but for the most part what happens is the characters talk.  And it isn't for the most part filled with pathos or venom or invective.  Even when characters are in conflict, it is intelligent, witty, restrained talk.  And even when characters are being mean to one another, the focus on the talk is not the way another character is cut down to size (something that rarely occurs on the show), but in the smartness and the intelligence of the talk.  If SEINFELD (and Larry David's CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM) is the premiere show for exploring the neuroses of human beings living in society with one another, THE GILMORE GIRLS is the series that most explores the joys to be found in people talking to one another.Season Two features some plot developments, but the events in the show are always tame compared with other shows.  Ironically, the rapidity of the talk and the energy in the dialogue always leaves me with the impression of each episode as being filled with a lot of content, though upon reflection the plots can be incredibly simple.  For instance, in the episode ""A-Tisket, A-Tasket,"" Dean and Jess have a fight because Jess outbids Dean for Rory's lunch basket (and the right to eat it with her).  Really, that is just about all that happens on the episode.  The action on nearly every episode is just slightly above the action in MY DINNER WITH ANDRE (hey, cultural references abound in the show, so why can't they in a review?).  The plot highlights of the year include such big events as Lorelai breaking off her engagement to Max, Lorelai discovering that her house has termites, Rory almost getting inducted into a secret society after the principal encourages her to get more involved in the social life of the school, Lane arranging to play on the drums a couple of days each week in the new music store, Sookie and Jackson get married, Lorelai and Chris almost get back together, and so on and so forth.  Now, the same kinds of things happen in soap operas, but there is nothing at all sudsy about THE GILMORE GIRLS.  There is zero pathos, and if given the opportunity to milk the viewer's emotions, the temptation is always resisted.  I read an interview with Amy Sherman-Palladino, the show's creator and creative force, in which she says that she was wanting to emulate the conversation that one can find in such thirties films as THE THIN MAN, in which Nick and Nora Charles (homage is even made to the pair in the title of the episode ""Nick and Nora/Sid and Nancy"") would casually knock about enormously witty, but somewhat detached, banter.The other thing that is notable in the show is the lack of anything seedy or scandalous in the town or the show, which is amazing given the fact that Lorelai's being a mother was the result of having gotten pregnant at age 16.  Jess is a bit of a juvenile delinquent, but most of the controversy in the town is generated by Taylor's endless crusades against one absurdly innocuous thing or another.  In one episode Paris decides to rip open the seedy underbelly of Stars Hollow, but the results are exceedingly meager.  All in all, the show contains less angst, less trauma, less conflict, and less drama than any other show on TV.  There is a lot of crankiness-Lorelai's mother being upset at one thing or another, Luke griping about one thing or another, or Lane's mother complaining about one thing or another-but little actual grief.  Even one of the big events of the season, Rory's breaking her arm in a car accident, is treated in a surprisingly subdued manner.Yet, the show really is brilliant.  Why?  First, the talk and conversation really is that good.  Second, the entire cast of characters form a marvelous ensemble cast.  If the writing was so consistently brilliant, and if the actors weren't so excellent at embracing their characters, the show would be awful.

850386,AGSWTH7SP2256,B0002Y4TOM,R. W. Rasband,"[22, 23]","Like many of you I approached ""Gilmore Girls"" with caution at first.  It's a family-oriented WB borderline-soap with a decidedly girly reputation.  That has not however stopped me from becoming addicted to one of the most falling-down funny, literate and psychologically complex shows on.  It's appointment TV for me along with ""The Sopranos"", the late, lamented ""Oz"" and ""Buffy"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm.""  Lauren Graham is a tough-minded, brilliantly comic marvel as Lorelai Gilmore, the renegade scion of a blue-blood Connecticut family who got pregnant at 16 and by sheer force of will created a great life for her daughter.  That daughter, also named Lorelai by her mother ""in a frenzy of pain medication,"" is nicknamed Rory and is played by the angelic Alexis Bledel.  Rory in public high school has aspirations to Harvard, so Lorelai approaches her starchy, proud parents after years of estrangement. (They are played with marvelous humanity by old-pros Edward Herrmann and Kelly Bishop.)  They gingerly begin to rebuild their relationship in order to realize Rory's possibly spectacular future.They say that executive producer Amy Sherman-Palladino sounds exactly like the verbally agile Lorelai when she speaks.  She has created an enchanted village for the Gilmores to live in called Stars Hollow.  This is where the genius of the show kicks in.  Instead of being sticky-sweet like a hundred other small town dwellers you've seen on TV, these people are benign but uncontrollably insane eccentrics who have created a little Utopia for individualists. (Just how does Kirk hold every job in town?)  The point of ""Gilmore Girls"" is that rigid social conventionality does not necessarily go hand-in-hand with ""family values.""  You can be a super-mon like Lorelai and still be a non-conformist.  Lorelai is currently looking for the ""whole stupid Dan Quayle, two dogs and a cat, matching running suits package"" in a family, but she's not putting off living her life and raising her daughter in the meantime.  (She will probably eventually get the whole package with the gruff but good-hearted Luke, the backwards-baseball cap-wearing diner owner who everyday feeds the cooking-challenged girls.)In the second season, we meet Jess, Luke's troubled nephew from the big city who has been sent to Stars Hollow to clean up his act.  Like a lot of fans, I am not that thrilled by the James-Dean-aping Jess, but he provokes an interesting reaction in Rory.  Normally she is the sweetest and most level-headed of girls but when she lays eyes on Jess she reveals an unsuspected streak of attraction towards the irresponsible little punk.  (Who resembles in character more than a little Rory's long-absent father.)  It appears that Rory has her own rebellion issues to work out; like mother, like daughter in more ways than one.  This is what I mean when I say this show is one of the most psychologically acute shows on TV.  Lorelai is Wonder Woman but also shows a inability to commit to a relationship with a man.  Rory is a preternaturally ""good girl"" with a  hidden but similar independent side that both delights and alarms her mother.

There are some interesting plot developments in this season - Lorelai gets engaged to Max and faces some dilemmas and inner conflict, Rory's stable relationship with Dean, her long-term boyfriend is threatened by the arrival of Jess, a rebellious teenager from NY who also happens to be Luke's nephew, and of course, the turbulent relationship that Lorelai has with her parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore goes through more upheaval.And Luke gets into some romantic entanglements of his own.There are other interesting developments in this season that make GG an addictive must-watch - Rory's rivalry with Paris Geller, Richard's forced retirement and its aftermath, Christopher's re-entry into the Gilmore girls' lives and many more. The eccentric townspeople of Stars Hollow add to the appeal of the show, Taylor Doose's 'dictatorship' of the town goes to new heights, Kirk's manic antics and many more.
