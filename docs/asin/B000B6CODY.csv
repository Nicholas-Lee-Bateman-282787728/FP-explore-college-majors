936597,A2FVE6V3YTFIDO,B000B6CODY,"Amazon Customer ""Glen""","[18, 19]","The second year of the Partridge Family found the gears of the Partridge money making machine spinning full tilt. David Cassidy's likeness graced the walls of countless teenybopper bedrooms and the music industry was taken by storm by an imaginary family band based on the Cowsills. But by year two, the Partridges had burst beyond the Cowsill mold and had implanted themselves firmly in the book of rock and roll history, their records outselling big performers of the time even breaking the Beatles reign of ""Let It Be"". Their LP ""Sound Magazine sold a staggering amount and hit gold status in no time and the show had been nominated for several awards. Season Two outshines possibly the rest of the four seasons and although many critics had passed off the show as silly, non-sensical fluff, the Partridges had already won the hearts of the American audience (as well as international fan clubs abroad!) The second season sees a lot of Danny's hairbrained schemes to propel the family to stardom and make money including making a whale part of the band and over breeding hamsters, Shirley going back to college, Laurie dating a biker (played to the hilt by All In The Family's own Meathead!), and the classic fan hit ""Santa, Don't Bring Your Guns To Town"" a funny yet touching Christmas tale starring veteran Dean Jagger.When they are not tooling around the country in their tour bus, the Partridges still find the time to help those in need (the Papagos Indians and a down and out bakery owner), and master the causes of endangered species (""Whatever Happened To Moby Dick"". The shows are funny, light and full of weekly ""Moral of the Week"" sensibilty that makes it highly fit for family consumption. As far as the DVD set, all 24 episodes are neatly packaged in two slim cases on 3 disks, the transfer is still remarkably clean and colorful after all of these years except for the girl scout scene in ""H-E-L-L-L-L-L-P"" which appears a bit fuzzy. This can be overlooked whereas the rest appears crisp and the sound fairly clear considering most of the music was produced in mono. Those of you with stereo sound will note the songs still stand out and sound fairly clear. Sadly, for those who enjoy the extras, there are none here aside from the ""Jump To Musical Performances"" yet there must be a fountain of extras out there available, whether it be bloopers or extra commentaries. I was so pleased to own these great shows, I can overlook the extras not being there. When all is said and done, the Partridge Family's Second Season is worth having just for the episodes and songs, no extras are necessary! A steal at these bargain prices. Do yourself a favor and buy both season one and two and c'mon.......get happy!!!",5,Board The Bus For A Second Year of Touring!,1133913600,"12 7, 2005",2005,2723,"['second', 'year', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'found', 'gears', 'Partridge', 'money', 'making', 'machine', 'spinning', 'full', 'tilt', 'David', 'Cassidy', 'likeness', 'graced', 'walls', 'countless', 'teenybopper', 'bedrooms', 'music', 'industry', 'was', 'taken', 'storm', 'imaginary', 'family', 'band', 'based', 'Cowsills', 'year', 'two', 'Partridges', 'had', 'burst', 'Cowsill', 'mold', 'had', 'implanted', 'firmly', 'book', 'rock', 'roll', 'history', 'records', 'outselling', 'big', 'performers', 'time', 'even', 'breaking', 'Beatles', 'reign', 'Let', 'Be', 'LP', 'Sound', 'Magazine', 'sold', 'staggering', 'amount', 'hit', 'gold', 'status', 'time', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'nominated', 'several', 'awards', 'Season', 'Two', 'outshines', 'possibly', 'rest', 'four', 'seasons', 'many', 'critics', 'had', 'passed', 'off', 'show', 'silly', 'non-sensical', 'fluff', 'Partridges', 'had', 'already', 'won', 'hearts', 'American', 'audience', 'as', 'well', 'international', 'fan', 'clubs', 'abroad', 'second', 'season', 'lot', 'Danny', 'hairbrained', 'schemes', 'propel', 'family', 'stardom', 'make', 'money', 'including', 'making', 'whale', 'part', 'band', 'breeding', 'hamsters', 'Shirley', 'going', 'back', 'college', 'Laurie', 'dating', 'biker', 'played', 'hilt', 'Family', 'own', 'Meathead', 'classic', 'fan', 'hit', 'Santa', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Bring', 'Guns', 'Town', 'funny', 'yet', 'touching', 'Christmas', 'tale', 'starring', 'veteran', 'Dean', 'Jagger.When', 'are', 'not', 'tooling', 'country', 'tour', 'bus', 'Partridges', 'still', 'find', 'time', 'help', 'need', 'Papagos', 'Indians', 'down', 'bakery', 'owner', 'master', 'causes', 'endangered', 'species', 'Happened', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'shows', 'are', 'funny', 'light', 'full', 'weekly', 'Moral', 'Week', 'sensibilty', 'highly', 'fit', 'family', 'consumption', 'As', 'far', 'DVD', 'set', '24', 'episodes', 'are', 'neatly', 'packaged', 'two', 'slim', 'cases', '3', 'disks', 'transfer', 'still', 'remarkably', 'clean', 'colorful', 'years', 'girl', 'scout', 'scene', 'H-E-L-L-L-L-L-P', 'bit', 'fuzzy', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'rest', 'crisp', 'sound', 'fairly', 'clear', 'considering', 'most', 'music', 'was', 'produced', 'mono', 'stereo', 'sound', 'will', 'note', 'songs', 'still', 'stand', 'out', 'sound', 'fairly', 'clear', 'Sadly', 'who', 'enjoy', 'extras', 'are', 'none', 'here', 'aside', 'Jump', 'Musical', 'Performances', 'yet', 'must', 'be', 'fountain', 'extras', 'there', 'available', 'be', 'bloopers', 'extra', 'commentaries', 'was', 'so', 'pleased', 'own', 'great', 'shows', 'can', 'overlook', 'extras', 'not', 'being', 'there', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'Second', 'Season', 'worth', 'having', 'just', 'episodes', 'songs', 'extras', 'are', 'necessary', 'steal', 'bargain', 'prices', 'Do', 'favor', 'buy', 'season', 'one', 'two', ""c'mon"", '.get', 'happy']",The Partridge Family - The Complete Second Season
936598,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B000B6CODY,barry,"[0, 0]","I grew up as a kid watching THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY.  I never missed the show and also bought all the albums.  It was such fun.  Now to watch it on dvd is a truly entertaining experience.  They put a lot of work into this dvd release.  The video is remeastered in high definition and has never looked better.  To watch the show unedited and without commercials shows how great this show really was.  The show is in no way dated.  It is quality family entertainment with Shirley Jones, David Cassidy, Susan Dey and Danny Bonaduce shining in particular.  I find watching the show as an adult that though very funny the show really was often tender and heartfelt.  This was truly a family that cared about each other and the unconditional love and support amongst them all provided a very strong message.Season 2 was when the show really hit its stride and whether it be Shirley going back to college or Danny getting his tonsils removed each episode shines.  And don't forget the music.  Bubblegum pop at its best.  This set also allows you to watch just the song performances as well which is a nice bonus.  If you have fond memories of THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY buying the dvds is a no brainer.  And believe me, it has never sounded or looked better.

936602,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B000B6CODY,Chrijeff,"[3, 3]","Despite a minor and never-explained cast change (blond Brian Forster taking over for brunet Jeremy Gelbwaks as drummer Chris), the Partridges retain their momentum in a second season whose episodes stem less from their show-biz career (though that's always an element) than from the natural crises of a family of five decent kids dealing with the difficulties of growing up and a sympathetic mother (Shirley Jones) trying to help them through the process.  Keith (David Cassidy) longs for his own apartment; Chris and Tracy (Suzanne Crough) decide to run away from home); Danny (Danny Bonaduce) goes to extraordinary lengths in his quest to finance a fur coat for his mother's birthday; and Laurie (Susan Dey) faces disaster when the school-newspaper editor unknowingly acquires her diary.  But they also address larger subjects on occasion, including the loneliness of the Jewish widow who wins ""a week with the Partridges,"" the burgeoning ecology movement of the 1970s, and the plight of American Indians on the reservation.  The family is wholesome and attractive, as too many modern-day sitcom ensembles aren't; the humor, if sometimes a bit broad or even embarrassing, is always clean; and the chemistry, not only among the family members but with their harried manager Reuben Kincaid (Dave Madden), is genuine and fun to watch.  Harry Morgan makes a second guest appearance, this time as a desert service-station owner who tries to get the Partridges to play for a festival benefiting his neighbors the Indians, and Ray Bolger and Rosemary DeCamp return as Shirley's free-spirited father and uptight neocon mother.  The songs are clean and tuneful (all the old Partridge albums are now out on CD), though of course largely performed by anonymous studio artists.  All in all, it's a good family show with a hearty dose of nostalgia for a transformative period.",4,"Come on, get happy",1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,1865,"['minor', 'never-explained', 'cast', 'change', 'blond', 'Brian', 'Forster', 'taking', 'over', 'brunet', 'Jeremy', 'Gelbwaks', 'drummer', 'Chris', 'Partridges', 'retain', 'momentum', 'second', 'season', 'episodes', 'stem', 'less', 'show-biz', 'career', 'always', 'element', 'natural', 'crises', 'family', 'five', 'decent', 'kids', 'dealing', 'difficulties', 'growing', 'up', 'sympathetic', 'mother', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'trying', 'help', 'process', 'Keith', 'David', 'Cassidy', 'longs', 'own', 'apartment', 'Chris', 'Tracy', 'Suzanne', 'Crough', 'decide', 'run', 'away', 'home', 'Danny', 'Danny', 'Bonaduce', 'extraordinary', 'lengths', 'quest', 'finance', 'fur', 'coat', 'mother', 'birthday', 'Laurie', 'Susan', 'Dey', 'disaster', 'when', 'school-newspaper', 'editor', 'unknowingly', 'diary', 'also', 'address', 'larger', 'subjects', 'occasion', 'including', 'loneliness', 'Jewish', 'widow', 'who', 'week', 'Partridges', 'burgeoning', 'ecology', 'movement', '1970s', 'plight', 'American', 'Indians', 'reservation', 'family', 'wholesome', 'attractive', 'too', 'many', 'modern-day', 'sitcom', 'ensembles', 'are', ""n't"", 'humor', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'broad', 'even', 'embarrassing', 'always', 'clean', 'chemistry', 'not', 'only', 'family', 'members', 'harried', 'manager', 'Reuben', 'Kincaid', 'Dave', 'Madden', 'genuine', 'fun', 'watch', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'second', 'guest', 'appearance', 'time', 'desert', 'service-station', 'owner', 'who', 'get', 'Partridges', 'play', 'festival', 'benefiting', 'neighbors', 'Indians', 'Ray', 'Bolger', 'Rosemary', 'DeCamp', 'return', 'Shirley', 'free-spirited', 'father', 'uptight', 'neocon', 'mother', 'songs', 'are', 'clean', 'tuneful', 'old', 'Partridge', 'albums', 'are', 'now', 'CD', 'course', 'largely', 'performed', 'anonymous', 'studio', 'artists', 'good', 'family', 'show', 'hearty', 'dose', 'nostalgia', 'transformative', 'period']",The Partridge Family - The Complete Second Season

Danny gets his tonsils out in an early episode and thinks that he can't really sing with the family for several weeks.Other things that happen during season two is that Danny gets his first crush on a neighbor girl named Gloria Hickey, but she likes Keith instead. Also the Partridge Family hires an ex-con and Rueben gets put in jail because he went to see if the ex-con had done a bank robbery.Also a very hilarious episode is on season two.

936607,A3GI22GLBVBGC2,B000B6CODY,Dusty,"[5, 6]","The Partridge Family settle into a smooth groove in season 2, with episodes that less frequently emphasize the novelty of an ordinary family trying to maintain its normaility while being transformed into pop icons.The episodes are no less fun to watch than season 1. However, some of the episodes in season 2 lack the realism of season 1, complete with dream sequences, some truly ludicrous plots, and slapstick that borders on Three Stooges insanity at times. None of this is necessarily a bad thing, mind you, but it does give an entirely different character to the show in season 2.For example, ""In 25 Words Or Less"" has a pop star family inviting a complete stranger who won a contest to live in their home for a week, before they've even met this person once. Aside from the arrogance of such a prize, which contrasts with their humility in season 1, it seems unlikely that in real life the winner of such a contest would receive much more than backstage passes to a concert--surrounded by bodyguards.Another episode (""Forty Year Itch"") reprises Shirley's parents in a plot that almost seems like a minor rewrite of a very similar episode in season 1, leaving me feeling somewhat cheated.The biggest offense, however, is found in ""Where Do Mermaids Go?"" Here, we have the wholly improbable plot of a hippie girl giving the family a million dollars, no strings attached, simply because they were nice to her for a day. Even worse, the family ends up giving the money back because of some rather minor inconveniences from gold-diggers and such, which could easily have been avoided if the writers weren't trying so hard to make a morality play out of the whole thing. In real life, the family would almost certainly have kept the money (since the girl didn't need it), moved to a more private home, and used that money for the purpose that they formed the band in the first place: to pay for the kids' college educations. This episode could eaily have been written by Frank Capra, since we are supposed to be as proud of the family for giving away their financial security as Capra taught a generation of Americans to be proud of giving up their extraordinary lifelong dreams in exchange for suburban mediocrity. The episode shares another thing in common with ""It's a Wonderful Life""--both feature an evil banker!At least two episodes stand out as particularly funny, however. ""I Am A Curious Partridge"" has Danny writing some vicious rumors about Keith and Shirley in a pop culture magazine, with predictably hilarious results (and getting a taste of his own medicine in return!). And best of all, ""H-E-L-L-L-L-L-P"", in which the men follow the camping women into the wilderness to protect them and end up needing to be rescued themselves, features what may be the best line in the entire series, when a beaten-down Reuben Kinkaid falls to his knees like Charlton Heston in ""Planet of the Apes"" and crys out, ""If nature is so perfect, why doesn't it make a can opener? Why, why, why?"" (Believe me, in context it will have you rolling with laughter!).Despite the uninspired writing and silly gimmicks that plague season 2, this is after all the Patridge Family--one of the best shows ever on television--and the episodes still have a lot of heart.

Shirley Partridge's maiden name?),  manager Reuben Kincaid's film debut in fairy wings and a tutu, a still-relevant appeal to protect the whales (including ""The Whale Song"", an otherwise unavailable track with Shirley on lead vocal) in ""Whatever Happened to Moby Dick?"", and something that still makes an impact on me, the incredible Shirley Jones in hot pants (in ""The Undergraduate"").  She was TV's sexiest mom back then, and probably for all time.The DVDs lack special features, but they have been remastered brilliantly and look amazing.

936629,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B000B6CODY,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[41, 46]","Being a kid is hard, and being a very successful rock group would be even harder, but the Partridge Family continued to pull an amazing balancing act throughout 24 episodes of the 1971-1972. By now the David Cassidy bubble-gum machine was in full force, but the Partridge Family remained a family show which treated all ensemble characters.First up, Keith has to confront the truth about a girl's singing in ""Dora, Dora, Dora"", smitten with a guests beauty he does not want to admit that she cannot sing until ultimately hearing a tape for himself. He has another humbling experience during ""In 25 words or less"" because the winner of a teen magazine contest ultimately turns out to be 60-year old Gloria Neugast, (Kay Medford) not exactly the woman of his dreams.  Gloria is initially nice, but she ends up driving the family nuts with her habits---and briefly continues this in a letter from her new homeAnd that's the other part of this sitcom's charm. These international rock stars are a suburban family also prone to many of the other emotional experiences their audiences (in `concert' and home viewing) are most likely to have. For all of the success this family still enjoys, they play intimate venues and continue living in their home.During ""Anatomy of a tonsil"" Danny has to get his tonsils taken out and is scared. Because he was so convinced that he would die from the procedure, he is genuinely shocked when he wakes up. However he is convinced that he cannot sing with his family anymore because his throat is sore immediately post-op. Danny continues believing this until his family uses a little reverse psychology upon him to encourage him rejoining the group; best friend Punky Lazar himself is recruited as Danny's `replacement'.Keith tries to replace the `father figure' after receiving Coach Dawson's advice about being the eldest male in ""Dr Jekyll and Mr. Partridge"". He has good intentions, but Keith does not realize that if he was not interested in attending `cultural events' at Chris, Tracy, and Danny's age (let alone now) they were not that keen either. Keith finally realizes that all of this parenting does not leave him with the time needed to complete his homework.  The other Partridge kids also apologize for having gotten back at Keith.Another mishap occurs with ""A tale of two hamsters"". Danny, Chris, and Tracy's hamster-raising business collides with the reality of touring. The Partridges cannot find a hotel which will accommodate lots of hamsters. Danny thinks giving a hamster away with the newest Partridge Family album will help alleviate things, but does not forecast how much work it is going to be in order to meet consumer demand.Like many other families, the Partridge kids squabble, but they ultimately attempt to care about each other.  During ""Days of acne and roses"", Danny realizes the grocery store delivery boy Wendell has a large crush on Laurie. Rather than discouraging the `nerd' from dating his sister, Danny and Keith help him with dating tips and gaining confidence. Their lessons work great because he ends up going on a dream date, also getting attention from other young women. Laurie then becomes concerned that Wendell will ask her to go steady, but he confides that he would like to play the field instead.Rob Reiner guest star in ""A man called Snake"". Because a young biker man camps out after Keith blabs incorrect information about his sister's love life to a teen magazine, this is one of the creepier shows. Laurie ultimately goes to the dance with him after initially being weirded out by the attention. This is one of the episodes which (despite the famous guest star) does not hold up well. The family seems unaware that the `sensitive poet' could actually harm Laurie.The family has better luck when they pick up a hitchhiker named Jenny (Merideth Baxter Birney) during ""Where do mermaids go"".  She seems nice enough, but when she leaves a bank book containing one million after a few days at their house, Shirley becomes suspicious. She thinks that the money could have been stolen. As it turns out, the money really was Jenny's to give, but the Partridge family was ultimately happiest being a suburban family who happened to travel with a psychedelic bus.Finally, Ray Bolger (the Scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz) guest stars as Grandpa Fred Renfrew in ""The fourty-year itch"".  Wanting to live a more youthful life, Grandpa shows up at his daughter's house just as the Partridges are about to begin yet another tour. Things heat up when Grandma arrives, but everything is nicely resolved at the end of the story.This series is a must for anybody wanting to take a super groovy return trip down memory lane.",4,Season two gives a good encore performance,1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,4690,"['Being', 'kid', 'hard', 'being', 'very', 'successful', 'rock', 'group', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'harder', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'continued', 'pull', 'amazing', 'balancing', 'act', '24', 'episodes', '1971-1972', 'now', 'David', 'Cassidy', 'bubble-gum', 'machine', 'was', 'full', 'force', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'remained', 'family', 'show', 'treated', 'ensemble', 'up', 'Keith', 'confront', 'truth', 'girl', 'singing', 'Dora', 'Dora', 'Dora', 'guests', 'beauty', 'not', 'want', 'admit', 'can', 'not', 'sing', 'ultimately', 'hearing', 'tape', 'humbling', 'experience', '25', 'words', 'less', 'winner', 'teen', 'magazine', 'contest', 'ultimately', 'out', 'be', '60-year', 'old', 'Gloria', 'Neugast', 'Kay', 'Medford', 'not', 'exactly', 'woman', 'dreams', 'Gloria', 'initially', 'nice', 'up', 'driving', 'family', 'habits', '-and', 'briefly', 'letter', 'new', 'homeAnd', 'other', 'part', 'sitcom', 'charm', 'international', 'rock', 'stars', 'are', 'suburban', 'family', 'also', 'prone', 'many', 'other', 'emotional', 'experiences', 'audiences', 'concert', 'home', 'viewing', 'are', 'most', 'likely', 'have', 'success', 'family', 'still', 'play', 'intimate', 'venues', 'continue', 'living', 'home.During', 'Anatomy', 'tonsil', 'Danny', 'get', 'tonsils', 'taken', 'out', 'scared', 'was', 'so', 'convinced', 'would', 'die', 'procedure', 'genuinely', 'shocked', 'when', 'up', 'However', 'convinced', 'can', 'not', 'sing', 'family', 'anymore', 'throat', 'sore', 'immediately', 'post-op', 'Danny', 'believing', 'family', 'little', 'reverse', 'psychology', 'encourage', 'rejoining', 'group', 'best', 'friend', 'Punky', 'Lazar', 'recruited', 'Danny', ""replacement'.Keith"", 'tries', 'replace', 'father', 'figure', 'receiving', 'Coach', 'Dawson', 'advice', 'being', 'eldest', 'male', 'Dr', 'Jekyll', 'Mr.', 'Partridge', 'good', 'intentions', 'Keith', 'not', 'realize', 'was', 'not', 'interested', 'attending', 'cultural', 'events', 'Chris', 'Tracy', 'Danny', 'age', 'let', 'alone', 'now', 'were', 'not', 'keen', 'Keith', 'finally', 'parenting', 'not', 'leave', 'time', 'needed', 'complete', 'homework', 'other', 'Partridge', 'kids', 'also', 'apologize', 'having', 'gotten', 'back', 'Keith.Another', 'mishap', 'A', 'tale', 'two', 'hamsters', 'Danny', 'Chris', 'Tracy', 'hamster-raising', 'business', 'collides', 'reality', 'touring', 'Partridges', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'hotel', 'will', 'accommodate', 'lots', 'hamsters', 'Danny', 'giving', 'hamster', 'away', 'newest', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'album', 'will', 'help', 'alleviate', 'things', 'not', 'forecast', 'how', 'much', 'work', 'going', 'be', 'order', 'meet', 'consumer', 'many', 'other', 'families', 'Partridge', 'kids', 'squabble', 'ultimately', 'attempt', 'care', 'other', 'Days', 'acne', 'roses', 'Danny', 'grocery', 'store', 'delivery', 'boy', 'Wendell', 'large', 'crush', 'Laurie', 'Rather', 'discouraging', 'nerd', 'dating', 'sister', 'Danny', 'Keith', 'help', 'dating', 'tips', 'gaining', 'confidence', 'lessons', 'work', 'great', 'up', 'going', 'dream', 'date', 'also', 'getting', 'attention', 'other', 'young', 'women', 'Laurie', 'then', 'concerned', 'Wendell', 'will', 'ask', 'go', 'steady', 'would', 'like', 'play', 'field', 'instead.Rob', 'Reiner', 'guest', 'star', 'A', 'man', 'called', 'Snake', 'young', 'biker', 'man', 'out', 'Keith', 'blabs', 'incorrect', 'information', 'sister', 'love', 'life', 'teen', 'magazine', 'one', 'creepier', 'shows', 'Laurie', 'ultimately', 'dance', 'initially', 'being', 'weirded', 'out', 'attention', 'one', 'episodes', 'famous', 'guest', 'star', 'not', 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'family', 'unaware', 'sensitive', 'poet', 'could', 'actually', 'harm', 'Laurie.The', 'family', 'better', 'luck', 'when', 'pick', 'up', 'hitchhiker', 'named', 'Jenny', 'Merideth', 'Baxter', 'Birney', 'Where', 'do', 'mermaids', 'go', 'nice', 'enough', 'when', 'bank', 'book', 'containing', 'one', 'million', 'few', 'days', 'house', 'Shirley', 'suspicious', 'money', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stolen', 'out', 'money', 'really', 'was', 'Jenny', 'give', 'Partridge', 'family', 'was', 'ultimately', 'happiest', 'being', 'suburban', 'family', 'who', 'happened', 'travel', 'psychedelic', 'bus.Finally', 'Ray', 'Bolger', 'Scarecrow', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'guest', 'stars', 'Grandpa', 'Fred', 'Renfrew', 'fourty-year', 'itch', 'Wanting', 'live', 'more', 'youthful', 'life', 'Grandpa', 'up', 'daughter', 'house', 'just', 'Partridges', 'are', 'begin', 'yet', 'tour', 'Things', 'heat', 'up', 'when', 'Grandma', 'everything', 'nicely', 'resolved', 'end', 'story.This', 'series', 'must', 'anybody', 'wanting', 'take', 'super', 'groovy', 'return', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane']",The Partridge Family - The Complete Second Season

936634,A20WKQ948WZOQJ,B000B6CODY,Wes Saylors Jr.,"[0, 0]","If you've ever wondered why it is you grew up wanting so strongly to be a member of the Partridge Family (even if it was just the little red haired girl who unconvincingly rattled her tambourine) then this season will put it all in perspective for you.  Arguably the best of the four season run of this awesome show, Season 2 finds Keith and Laurie and Danny and Shirley and Reuben and the two little kids (one of them the unconvincing tambourine player) comfortably finding their characters and interacting with each other in warm, funny and even moving ways.  And as always, no episode would be complete without the family on stage, in front of an audience that was always seated at dinner tables for some reason, and singing one of their terrific pop songs. -- One of the things that's nice is finding David Cassidy, who by this time had reached pop icon status, playing his part as Keith in a charming, self-deprecating way -- more sad sack than sex symbol.  He does this very well. And we all know that Danny Bonaduce was the comic of the show (his by-play with both Cassidy and Dave Madden is truly hilarious), but both Susan Dey and Shirley Jones have found their comic bones in season 2 and offer very funny performances.  The Partridges seem like more of a unit now, and their interplay is both convincing and very funny.  This is really one of the best shows of the 1970s and it holds up very well today.  Funny and entertaining and full of music.
