Evigan is perfect as Jake Cardigan, and you actually get to see old William Shatner in a movie that was based on his first best-selling novel of the same name!

You would think that since this is Shatner's baby, he should have had more control over it rather than let someone else do damage to a book!

Like the Kevin Sorbo Hercules TV movies that came first THEN the series.  They should include EVERYTHING! otherwise It would be unfair to the fans.
