I see why the 2 are so often compared, but I would describe the 13th Floor as an intellectual version of the Matrix.The plot has already been discussed so I am going to simply mention some of my favorite aspects of this film. It was fascinating how these programmers could create such a realistic virtual world, wherein the people are programs and have no idea of the truth (see, how the Matrix ripped it off?). Imagine finding out you are nothing but a bunch of 1's and 0's and there is no possibility for change or escape?It is exceedingly clever how one character leaves clues in the virtual world that allows another character to help solve a mystery in the real one.Interestingly, perhaps due to a limited budget, more attention was paid to the actual story instead of filling the screen with all kinds of cheesy cgi, which resulted in a better, more fulfilling movie, as opposed to a simple action flick.Vincent D'Onofrio submits yet another stellar acting performance. I am always floored by how he can look so completely different from one role to the next. Check out the brilliant independant flick, Salton Sea, if you are a fan. (As an aside, while I did not particularly enjoy The Cell, Vincent gave the most chilling performance I have ever seen in my life and one that I will never forget...too bad Jlo was involved.)If you are interested in the concept of virtual reality or even parallel worlds, or maybe just new types of entertainment technology, you will no doubt enjoy the 13th Floor.

With that sort of strange juxtaposing of opinions behind it, it was as if the universe itself was wanting me to see The Thirteenth Floor, and who am I to argue with the universe? Having now seen this movie I can report that the universe's ability to recommend motion pictures is impressive. I liked The Thirteenth Floor both in its own right and in its capacity to be a sort of anti-Matrix, a smarter, less flashy, more to the point species of intelligent science fiction lacking back in the late 1990's when it was released in cinemas. As I remember, fantasy-seeking audiences back then went for blazing guns and bleak dystopian landscapes, pleather jumpsuits and characters with names like some sort of neo-retro-visitation of ancient mythos, and it is to their detriment that so many of them missed The Thirteenth Floor back in its initial release. Telling the tale of a murder of one of the brilliant creators of a virtual world so real its denizens believe they are alive, The Thirteenth Floor visits film noir as readily as vintage sci-fi, and does it with a stylish tip of the hat back to some of the biggest films of both genres, from Blade Runner to The Maltese Falcon, and yet as it does it never loses its own claim to classic status. Its twists and turns gyrate through a story that concludes nowhere near where it began and yet somehow ties up every loose end before its magnificently satisfying conclusion.

14946,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,0767819446,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[23, 28]","In 1999, `The Thirteenth Floor' was a film with an interesting concept but since it came out after `The Matrix', the film kind of wasn't all that popular in the US.  But if there was one thing that `The Thirteenth Floor' would be known for during the beginning of the DVD era and most likely now with its Blu-ray release is the fantastic audio.  For audiophiles looking for a film that is up there there in quality HD sound, `The Thirteenth Floor' sounds absolute beautiful in Dolby TrueHD!""THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR"" is a film based on Daniel Galouye's book ""Simulacron 3' and directed by German director Josef Rusnak and produced by Roland Emmerich (Director and Producer of ""Independence Day"", ""The Patriot"", ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""10,000 BC"").The film takes place in the late 1990's and starts off with Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl), an owner of a multi-billion dollar tech company known for it's work in virtual reality simulation.  As he quickly visits the bar and gives an urgent letter to the bar keeper Jerry Ashton (Vincent D'Oforio), Hannon visits a local bar and meets up with someone he knows but is stabbed to death.The film then shifts to his good friend and protege Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko) who is contacted by the authorities specifically by LAPD Detective Larry McBain (Dennis Haysbert) for questioning in regards to Fuller's death.  While both Hall and McBain visit Hannon's suite, they run into a woman who says that she is his daughter Jane (Gretchen Mol) and just came to town to visit her father.As for Hall, he is shocked that his boss and good friend is dead but he feels that perhaps Fuller may have left him a clue in the virtual reality world that Fuller has been downloading into.The concept of virtual reality with Fuller's technology is that a person has the ability to download themselves into a player and thus acting them out in almost a real-like world.  For Douglas, he downloads himself into John Ferguson during the 1920's where he sees a version of Fuller and also meets up with the barkeeper (who has the urgent message written by Fuller and has read it).  He tries to visit the online world and the first time he gets into that virtual world, he is shocked by how real it is.  But what Ferguson doesn't know is that the barkeeper has seen Hall/Ferguson switch bodies and thus causing implications in the virtual world.Things get out-of-hand during the second visit in which Ferguson meets up with Fuller to discuss this urgent letter that he wrote to him.  Ferguson meets up with the barkeeper to find out why he has taken the letter meant for him and the barkeeper tells him that the letter contained information about the End of the World.  In other words, driving to a location and finding out that the world that they (the characters in the virtual world) live in, is not real.With someone from the virtual world now knowing the truth that their existence is not real, he shoots Ferguson to see if he will die.  Fortunately, for Hall, he returns to his reality.Meanwhile, Detective McBain and the authorities have a received an eyewitness report that Douglass Hall was responsible for the murder of Fuller and thus arrest him but release him out on bail when they have no real evidence against him.  When McBain tells him that Fuller's daughter is not who she thinks that he is, Hall becomes even more confused.That is until he drives to ""The End of the World"" and realizes that all this time, the world he lives in is a virtual world and he is a virtual character.  Shocked by this development, Douglass tries to find out the truth of what is real and what is not real and who may have killed Fuller in his world.  The person who may have the answer is the woman pretending to be Fuller's daughter.  Thus Douglas begins his search for her.VIDEO & AUDIO:""THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR"" is presented in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ration of 2:40:1.  In some scenes, the picture quality looks good but for some other scenes, it looks aged.  So, picture quality is a bit uneven at times.  The film tends to use a lot of darker colors.  A lot of blacks and if there is one thing that makes the film look cool is the actual use of city lights, the city look and just its use of darkness.  The setup for the virtual world is OK despite it being ten years since the film came out.  There are some technology featured on the film that shouts ""1990's"" but overall, the way the film goes from present time, to the past and then to the future, I liked that aspect.  Granted, comparing it to ""THE MATRIX"" which came out a few months prior, unfortunately budget wise, the film didn't have the same quality or high technology type of feel.If there was one thing going for the film, it was its use of audio.  I remember during the initial home theater discussions for DVD's, ""THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR"" was among the top DVD's around 2001-2002 that were looked at as ""reference"" DVD's to show off one's home theater system because of the awesome audio.  I remember testing the audio in my older receiver and just to hear the glass shatter, the virtual reality beams making its' noise to gun shots.  The film's audio quality was just awesome.So, needless to say, I had high expectations for the Dolby TrueHD audio for this film and sure enough, it didn't disappoint.  The film came out loud and clear and I felt the sound all around me.  The glass shattering and the virtual reality beams just sounded enormously sweet and overall, if I had it any louder, I think I could busted my eardrum.  Now granted, with newer films that scream of gorgeous sound like ""Quantum of Solace"" and ""Transformers"",  for an older film,  ""THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR"" is just audio goodness and despite being ten years old, the film is just amazing to listen to.  Its definitely a disc worth picking up to showcase Dolby TrueHD sound.SPECIAL FEATURES:""THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR"" unfortunately does not come with as many special features as its original DVD release. Included on the Blu-ray are:* Commentary with Director Josef Rusnak and Production Designer Kirk M. Petruccelli - The commentary track features Josef Rusnak but if anything, with the film utilizing so much production design, it was a good choice by Rusnak to include Kirk M. Petruccelli to discuss a lot of the work he had to do for the film.  If there was anything that I found quite intriguing in the commentary was Rusnak's comment about the end.  He filmed so many different endings and even 'till now, he is not sure if he chose the correct ending.* Music Video of ""Erase/Rewind"" by the Cardigans - An older music video by the Cardigans.* Previews: Film trailersThe original DVD had a few more special features such as the audio test utilizing the film ""Godzilla"" which Emmerich did direct, production notes, conceptual art gallery and special effects gallery.  Not quite sure why they eliminated those.The Blu-ray is also BD-Live enabled.JUDGMENT CALL:Personally, I actually enjoyed ""THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR"".  It was an interesting concept about virtual reality worlds and what if those virtual reality worlds created other virtual reality worlds and thus, I'm sure it can get quite confusing.  Especially if one is able to freely travel to different eras.But part of the problem with ""THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR"" is that with a $16 million budget, there is only so much you can do.  And with a film like ""THE MATRIX"" coming out a few months before ""THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR"" back in 1999, they have their similarities but special effects-wise, ""THE MATRIX"" was just a significant film, while the ""THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR"" didn't have any super star power behind it and didn't do well in the box office.But I watched the film several times over the years and there's something about the film that has that ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" holodeck vibe, the adventure of visiting other worlds in different eras and combining the sci-fi time travel, suspense and in the end, ""THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR"" is a thrilling story.  I felt that Craig Bierko and Gretchen Mol did a fine job with portraying multiple characters and their mannerisms.  But It's just that with a small budget, there is only so much you can do in terms of special effects.But despite its shortcomings, ""THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR"" is one of those films that is worth giving a chance and who knows, you may enjoy it. I certainly did.  And as for the audiophiles, this  film will definitely be a pleasuring auditory experience.",4,Blu-ray: A 3-star film which gets an extra star for it's audio!,1239753600,"04 15,

What I do know is that I was scratching my  head right off the bat.  However, the movie quickly ends my temporary  confusion when we are shown that the opening scenes are from a virtual  reality game that is so compelling (it places the player inside late 30's  L.A.) that the player actually feels these computer-generated characters  are real.  Indeed, the characters themselves think they are real.What  starts as seemingly a rip off of ""The Matrix"" theme (or a greatly expanded  version of a Star Trek holodeck), quickly turns into a murder mystery, and  it is handled quite effectively (except for the virtual reality scenario,  it is nothing like ""The Matrix"").  Although the stars in the film aren't  household names, and some of the dialogue seemed just a tad pedestrian, the  story draws the viewer in and takes you on its own ride.

Unfortunately The Thirteenth Floor falls way short of ever reaching the  bar, let alone going over it.  The concept of virtual worlds, within  virtual worlds didn't quite work in this version because you never find out  why they exist.  In The Matrix we at least find out that the virtual world  therein was created to make humans sedate as they were used as organic  power supplies by the AI.  The Thirteenth Floor is a pretty hum-drum  affair. Every time they used the word &quot;user&quot; I kept thinking of  the classic Tron, a different, yet far better virtual world movie.  The  ending was pretty useless.  It really answered no questions, and (heaven  forbid!) left the way open for a possible sequel.  And another thing, the  title had nothing to do with the movie other than the lab resided on the  13th floor, and every once in awhile you would see a finger push the  elevator button to reach that floor.  The scene where Douglas Hall drove to  &quot;the end of the world&quot; was rather weak as well.  As he stood  there talking on his cellphone he stared at an untextured wireframe of his  existence, hokey.  I didn't hate this movie because the concept of virtual  worlds is rather intriguing . . . they just managed to make it boring!

Fine with me. But one layer is positioned as dominant and it is the most advanced in time that is. Why? Why not ours? Our time becomes nothing but the past of some other future time that is the real present. That is traumatic since after a while you do not know who is who and who is real or not in any world. Some are not even real at all in any world. The worse part is that you can just get rid of anyone in any layer of time in the past because your real existence is in the future present, the real future present world of 2024. So who cares about what havoc you may cause and create and enjoy in some past layer of the world? But it has no effect on the future because the film states that that future of 2024 is the real thing that commands all the past layers? But why not 3024? And what if 2024 were nothing but some manipulated past of 3024? Disquieting because then time does not exist any more, everything is in the hands of some super-being we don't know. In other words the film reinvents God, not as a real being but as a virtual necessity, a concept without which nothing stands. The film is well done, but the meaning is some absolute submission to some kind of fatality that makes us puppets, and the word is even used.

14972,A3D09XGX4FOLSB,0767819446,KinoChelovek,"[0, 0]","I finally watched this movie, hoping for a more CGI version of Fassbinder's remarkably great movie &#34;World on a Wire&#34; (1973), or even something that was respectful to the original story. It was neither; I was astounded at how bad this movie was.Notes before reading: 1) I read the Galouye story, &#34;Simulacron-3,&#34; BEFORE watching either Fassbinder's adaptation or this one; 2) I am a fan of Armin Mueller-Stahl; 3) I enjoy sci-fi immensely. I really, really attempted to like this movie, mostly because of the numerical ratings it has received here and on imdb (and I don't read the written reviews beforehand).The beginning really made me believe I was going to be awed: the great 1930s landscape, a film noir look, interesting-looking set designs, and (to top it all off) the GREAT Armin Mueller-Stahl! But what brought me awe quickly turned into balderdash. The story merely relied on 1/3rds of the original story, with the characters changing their original literary roles that gave the story so much depth. The questions of &#34;what is real&#34; in the original story was not the cynical plot of this adaptation. The special effects were the equivalent to those of a rock concert, with laser lights in fog, glowing eyes, and (straight from television's &#34;Stargate SG-1&#34; - but even less graphic) wormholes! I don't know what the budget was for this movie, but I guarantee that Fassbinder's wonderful adaptation was even less than the budget for this movie.The story follows Douglas Hall and his attempt to find the killer of Fuller, his partner. Dennis Haysbert plays, with little depth, a detective (who has an entirely different role in the story) attempting to find the murderer. Vincent d'Onofrio looks and acts like a slightly-overweight John Malkovich, playing the most interesting character, the Simulacron-3 technician, but, with how interesting the other characters were, this really isn't saying much. Basically, you have a huge cast of TV actors and actresses, and there is a reason that they do TV (even though some have &#34;touched&#34; cinema, off and on).I really don't know how far to go in the scenario, but I felt like I was watching a really bad, B-grade, made-for-cable-TV sci-fi that was relying more upon capitalizing on the success of &#34;The Matrix&#34; and others of its ilk than being true to Galouye's story. I tend to believe that the filmmakers were wanting to &#34;jump on the bandwagon&#34; at the time, regardless of the cost to the original story. Perhaps many of those reviews that give this movie such high marks were done by those anti-&#34;The Matrix&#34; fans. I really don't know. Maybe times have changed, and many of the reviewers may want to go back and replay this movie with some more objectivity.Even more aggravating is that the movie must be so bad in the producers' eyes that they can't even stand to release the DVD in WIDESCREEN!!! That really tells you something!I commented to my wife that more money was probably spent on the helicopter shots than the rest of the movie. I really wish Galouye's original story would be given the credit and respect it is due, along with the ability to do so with the CGI effects that are now the mainstay of cinema.I give 2 stars for Mueller-Stahl (always a great screen presence, even though his acting is wasted here) and for the quite breathtaking ending effects of the future in the end - the end being the closest to that of the novel, but too late for the rest of the movie to be good.",2,Weak Adaptation of Galouye's Novel and Underwhelming.,1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,3504,"['finally', 'watched', 'movie', 'hoping', 'more', 'CGI', 'version', 'Fassbinder', 'remarkably', 'great', 'movie', '34', 'World', 'Wire', '34', '1973', 'even', 'something', 'was', 'respectful', 'original', 'story', 'was', 'neither', 'was', 'astounded', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'reading', '1', 'read', 'Galouye', 'story', '34', 'Simulacron-3', '34', 'watching', 'Fassbinder', 'adaptation', 'one', '2', 'am', 'fan', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', '3', 'enjoy', 'sci-fi', 'immensely', 'really', 'really', 'attempted', 'like', 'movie', 'mostly', 'numerical', 'ratings', 'received', 'here', 'imdb', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'written', 'reviews', 'beforehand', '.The', 'beginning', 'really', 'made', 'believe', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'awed', 'great', '1930s', 'landscape', 'film', 'noir', 'look', 'interesting-looking', 'set', 'designs', 'top', 'off', 'GREAT', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'what', 'brought', 'awe', 'quickly', 'turned', 'balderdash', 'story', 'merely', 'relied', '1/3rds', 'original', 'story', 'characters', 'changing', 'original', 'literary', 'roles', 'gave', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'questions', '34', 'what', 'real', '34', 'original', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'cynical', 'plot', 'adaptation', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'equivalent', 'rock', 'concert', 'laser', 'lights', 'fog', 'glowing', 'eyes', 'straight', 'television', '34', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', '34', 'even', 'less', 'graphic', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'budget', 'was', 'movie', 'guarantee', 'Fassbinder', 'wonderful', 'adaptation', 'was', 'even', 'less', 'budget', 'movie.The', 'story', 'Douglas', 'Hall', 'attempt', 'find', 'killer', 'Fuller', 'partner', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'little', 'depth', 'detective', 'who', 'entirely', 'different', 'role', 'story', 'attempting', 'find', 'murderer', 'Vincent', ""d'Onofrio"", 'looks', 'acts', 'slightly-overweight', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'playing', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'Simulacron-3', 'technician', 'how', 'interesting', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'really', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much', 'Basically', 'have', 'huge', 'cast', 'TV', 'actors', 'actresses', 'reason', 'do', 'TV', 'even', 'have', '34', 'touched', '34', 'cinema', 'off', '.I', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'far', 'go', 'scenario', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'really', 'bad', 'B-grade', 'made-for-cable-TV', 'sci-fi', 'was', 'relying', 'more', 'upon', 'capitalizing', 'success', '34', 'Matrix', '34', 'others', 'ilk', 'being', 'true', 'Galouye', 'story', 'tend', 'believe', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'wanting', '34', 'jump', 'bandwagon', '34', 'time', 'regardless', 'cost', 'original', 'story', 'Perhaps', 'many', 'reviews', 'give', 'movie', 'such', 'high', 'marks', 'were', 'done', 'anti-', '34', 'Matrix', '34', 'fans', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Maybe', 'times', 'have', 'changed', 'many', 'reviewers', 'may', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'replay', 'movie', 'more', 'objectivity.Even', 'more', 'aggravating', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'producers', 'eyes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'stand', 'release', 'DVD', 'WIDESCREEN', 'really', 'something', 'commented', 'wife', 'more', 'money', 'was', 'probably', 'spent', 'helicopter', 'shots', 'rest', 'movie', 'really', 'wish', 'Galouye', 'original', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'given', 'credit', 'respect', 'due', 'ability', 'do', 'so', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'now', 'mainstay', 'cinema.I', 'give', '2', 'stars', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'always', 'great', 'screen', 'presence', 'even', 'acting', 'wasted', 'here', 'quite', 'breathtaking', 'ending', 'effects', 'future', 'end', 'end', 'being', 'closest', 'novel', 'too', 'late', 'rest', 'movie', 'be', 'good']",N/A
14973,A356RFKNIG043B,0767819446,K. Swanson,"[2, 2]","[Non-spoiler comments]I've seen this film a few times, mainly because I like wrapping my mind around multiple-world concepts. While 13th Floor doesn't reach the cinematic or conceptual heights and depths of Blade Runner and other true classics of the genre, it's certainly worth seeing. The performances are good if mostly not great, though the script is quite solid, and while the few effects are kind of hokey, both 1937 L.A. and the details in the modern world are very nicely designed and make the film worth seeing a few times.It's hard not to compare this with The Matrix, as the basic concept is quite similar, and the feel is clearly 1999, though TM is truly superior in almost every way. 13th wisely avoids going for the full-on effects, and its small budget forces it to use the philosophical pretexts well. Bierko and Mol and Stahl are acceptable, but Stahl and especially the redoubtable D'Onofrio add considerably more brio to their roles. Vincent has taken many a decent film and notched it up with his unique charisma, and this is no exception.I do think that if D'Onofrio and Bierko had reversed roles here, it would be a far better film. Bierko just doesn't have the dramatic depth. Stahl outmatches him in every scene, but when Stahl and D'Ono get together here, those brief scenes steal the film, dramatically.And Dennis Haysbert should give back his acting fees for every film he's ever made now that he's the Allstate guy! I can't see him or hear his voice in anything without immediately thinking of insurance sleaziness, which is great for them but miserable for all the films he's in. I know that seems like a joke, but I swear he really pulls me out of this movie whenever he shows up. And, frankly, it's no wonder he became a pitchman, as he's no great actor. He overplays this role and should have watched Ford in Blade Runner to see how to make laconic say so much more than snidely menacing.The blu-ray transfer is mostly crisp, but certain scenes suffer from a lower transfer quality than others, which can be momentarily distracting. There are actually less extras than the dvd, which is pointless and a bit of a rip-off at double the price. Unless you worship this movie, I'd say go for the dvd. The transfer is good but not world-class; the Matrix blu-ray blows this out of the water.[Spoiler thoughts]One of the weakest moments here for me is when they reach the end of their world and it looks like an outtake from Tron. Come on, is that really the best that could be done? Half-done green-line renderings of distant mountains? The programmers would simply program nothing there, not a tracery in LED lines. Better to simply show an edge-of-nothingness scenario. It jars me out of the well-made world of the film into realizing this is an occasionally hokey sci-fi film.Ditto with the Pink Floyd laser spray when they enter the Other World. Come on! It's pointless and distracting and makes the clean jack-in of The Matrix seem pure and elegant by comparison. Which is a drag, as the set design of 13th Floor is otherwise so well done, with many tiny details that add much to the feel.Galouye's Simulacron-3 novel inspired this story, and I also think the writers here missed the mark by not using more of his ideas. He explored the philosophical implications of the triple-world idea to greater effect than this did, and seeing as that's the key to the whole premise, it deserves more weight. There are SO many possibilities with that concept, and they're barely scratched here in favor of the rather weak love story. To my mind that's the single greatest flaw in 13th Floor: it has so many deeper moments waiting in those other potential realities and it just lets them slide on by.One thing I do like is how we're shown but never told that when you die in your double, his consciousness replaces yours in your world. It's a fine double-jeopardy idea that works even better for us having to notice it ourselves. But it does set up a really cheesy Hollywood ending that distracts from the weight of the ideas here. What about getting stuck in the third world? So many maybes disposed of in favor of a weak wrap-it-up-neatly denouement.Anyhow, just one sci-fi fan's opinion. But what do I know; I'd like to see almost every Philip K. Dick story set to film, so I tend to want to see the ideas more than the drama in these movies. 13th Floor offers more melodrama than conceptual brilliance, but it's certainly worth seeing and is holding up well as the years go by.",4,Good sci-fi film gets decent blu-ray tansfer,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,4500,"['[', 'Non-spoiler', 'comments', ']', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'few', 'times', 'mainly', 'like', 'wrapping', 'mind', 'multiple-world', 'concepts', '13th', 'Floor', ""n't"", 'reach', 'cinematic', 'conceptual', 'heights', 'depths', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'other', 'true', 'classics', 'genre', 'certainly', 'worth', 'seeing', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'mostly', 'not', 'great', 'script', 'quite', 'solid', 'few', 'effects', 'are', 'kind', 'hokey', '1937', 'L.A.', 'details', 'modern', 'world', 'are', 'very', 'nicely', 'designed', 'make', 'film', 'seeing', 'few', 'times.It', 'hard', 'not', 'compare', 'Matrix', 'basic', 'concept', 'quite', 'similar', 'feel', 'clearly', '1999', 'TM', 'truly', 'superior', 'almost', 'way', '13th', 'wisely', 'avoids', 'going', 'full-on', 'effects', 'small', 'budget', 'forces', 'use', 'philosophical', 'pretexts', 'well', 'Bierko', 'Mol', 'Stahl', 'are', 'acceptable', 'Stahl', 'especially', 'redoubtable', ""D'Onofrio"", 'add', 'considerably', 'more', 'brio', 'roles', 'Vincent', 'taken', 'many', 'decent', 'film', 'notched', 'up', 'unique', 'charisma', 'exception.I', 'do', 'think', ""D'Onofrio"", 'Bierko', 'had', 'reversed', 'roles', 'here', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'better', 'film', 'Bierko', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'dramatic', 'depth', 'Stahl', 'scene', 'when', 'Stahl', ""D'Ono"", 'get', 'together', 'here', 'brief', 'scenes', 'steal', 'film', 'dramatically.And', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'should', 'give', 'back', 'acting', 'fees', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'now', 'Allstate', 'guy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'hear', 'voice', 'anything', 'immediately', 'thinking', 'insurance', 'sleaziness', 'great', 'miserable', 'films', 'know', 'joke', 'swear', 'really', 'pulls', 'movie', 'whenever', 'up', 'frankly', 'wonder', 'became', 'pitchman', 'great', 'actor', 'role', 'should', 'have', 'watched', 'Ford', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'see', 'how', 'make', 'laconic', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'snidely', 'menacing.The', 'blu-ray', 'transfer', 'mostly', 'crisp', 'certain', 'scenes', 'suffer', 'lower', 'transfer', 'quality', 'others', 'can', 'be', 'momentarily', 'distracting', 'are', 'actually', 'less', 'extras', 'dvd', 'pointless', 'bit', 'rip-off', 'double', 'price', 'worship', 'movie', ""'d"", 'say', 'go', 'dvd', 'transfer', 'good', 'not', 'world-class', 'Matrix', 'blu-ray', 'blows', 'water', 'Spoiler', 'thoughts', ']', 'One', 'weakest', 'moments', 'here', 'when', 'reach', 'end', 'world', 'outtake', 'Tron', 'Come', 'really', 'best', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'Half-done', 'green-line', 'renderings', 'distant', 'mountains', 'programmers', 'would', 'simply', 'program', 'nothing', 'there', 'not', 'tracery', 'LED', 'lines', 'Better', 'simply', 'show', 'edge-of-nothingness', 'scenario', 'well-made', 'world', 'film', 'realizing', 'occasionally', 'hokey', 'sci-fi', 'film.Ditto', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'laser', 'spray', 'when', 'enter', 'Other', 'World', 'Come', 'pointless', 'distracting', 'clean', 'jack-in', 'Matrix', 'seem', 'pure', 'elegant', 'comparison', 'Which', 'drag', 'set', 'design', '13th', 'Floor', 'otherwise', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'many', 'tiny', 'details', 'add', 'much', 'feel.Galouye', 'Simulacron-3', 'novel', 'inspired', 'story', 'also', 'think', 'writers', 'here', 'missed', 'mark', 'not', 'using', 'more', 'ideas', 'explored', 'philosophical', 'implications', 'triple-world', 'idea', 'greater', 'effect', 'did', 'seeing', 'key', 'whole', 'premise', 'more', 'weight', 'are', 'SO', 'many', 'possibilities', 'concept', ""'re"", 'barely', 'scratched', 'here', 'favor', 'rather', 'weak', 'love', 'story', 'mind', 'single', 'greatest', 'flaw', '13th', 'Floor', 'so', 'many', 'deeper', 'moments', 'waiting', 'other', 'potential', 'realities', 'just', 'slide', 'by.One', 'thing', 'do', 'like', 'how', ""'re"", 'shown', 'never', 'told', 'when', 'die', 'double', 'consciousness', 'replaces', 'yours', 'world', 'fine', 'double-jeopardy', 'idea', 'even', 'better', 'having', 'notice', 'set', 'up', 'really', 'cheesy', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'weight', 'ideas', 'here', 'What', 'getting', 'stuck', 'third', 'world', 'So', 'many', 'maybes', 'disposed', 'favor', 'weak', 'wrap-it-up-neatly', 'denouement.Anyhow', 'just', 'one', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'opinion', 'what', 'do', 'know', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'almost', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'story', 'set', 'film', 'tend', 'want', 'see', 'ideas', 'more', 'drama', 'movies', '13th', 'Floor', 'offers', 'more', 'melodrama', 'conceptual', 'brilliance', 'certainly', 'worth', 'seeing', 'holding', 'up', 'well', 'years', 'go']",N/A

In fact, I almost missed it due to poor reviews flooding on the net and newspapers. after watching the thirteenth floor, i realize that you have to watch and anaylze the movie by yourself in order to determine if it is good or not instead of trusting everything that is said by the reviews. people have different thinkings and a movie may appeal to one while others may find it disgusting. well, i think the thirteenth floor is one of that kind of movies that one may love it or be confused and thus hate it.i am not going to give out much about the story 'cause that's exactly what is fascinating about this movie. but i can tell you what makes it such a unique experience for me. there are two important (or weird for some of you) questions that are confusing me all the time, which are why are we born in this world and what will happen after our lives when this world come to an end. the thirteenth floor provides probable answers to both questions. may be our world is just a simulation program manipulated by some higher intelligent beings from another planet or by a computer tech from the future so that everything we see in the world are only someone's fantasy or thoughts. no matter you believe or not, the thirteenth floor may make you think and reevaluate your current beliefs.even if you do not find the story interesting, you cannot deny that the cinematography and production design are superb. the elegant re-creation of los angeles in the thirties will definitely shine in your eyes in contrast to the coarse and vulgar tone of the present. in fact, i could not find any flaw in the photography work, every shot is just done fantastically! and finally for acting, the four protagonists all gave powerful performance to their roles (all of them have to act at least two roles 'cause they got different identities in the past, present or the future). armin mueller-stahl (shine) gave another strong performance as the old scientist and the creator of the simulated world. gretchen mol, starring as his daughter, is one of the most beautiful actresses i have ever seen on the screen and she proves to be a very versatile actress in this movie.for people who have watched the matrix, try also to watch this one which i think is much better and deserves more attention.",5,Superb and deserves more attention,1003104000,"10 15, 2001",2001,2378,"['Wow', 'only', 'word', 'i', 'can', 'think', 'tell', 'how', 'i', 'feel', 'terrific', 'sci-fic', 'mystery', 'fact', 'almost', 'missed', 'due', 'poor', 'reviews', 'flooding', 'net', 'newspapers', 'watching', 'thirteenth', 'floor', 'i', 'realize', 'have', 'watch', 'anaylze', 'movie', 'order', 'determine', 'good', 'not', 'instead', 'trusting', 'everything', 'said', 'reviews', 'people', 'have', 'different', 'thinkings', 'movie', 'may', 'appeal', 'one', 'others', 'may', 'find', 'disgusting', 'well', 'i', 'think', 'thirteenth', 'floor', 'one', 'kind', 'movies', 'one', 'may', 'love', 'be', 'confused', 'thus', 'hate', 'it.i', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'give', 'out', 'much', 'story', 'exactly', 'what', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'i', 'can', 'tell', 'such', 'unique', 'experience', 'are', 'two', 'important', 'weird', 'questions', 'are', 'confusing', 'time', 'are', 'why', 'are', 'born', 'world', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'lives', 'when', 'world', 'come', 'end', 'thirteenth', 'floor', 'probable', 'answers', 'questions', 'may', 'be', 'world', 'just', 'simulation', 'program', 'manipulated', 'higher', 'intelligent', 'beings', 'planet', 'computer', 'tech', 'future', 'everything', 'see', 'world', 'are', 'only', 'someone', 'fantasy', 'thoughts', 'matter', 'believe', 'not', 'thirteenth', 'floor', 'may', 'make', 'think', 'reevaluate', 'current', 'beliefs.even', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'story', 'interesting', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'cinematography', 'production', 'design', 'are', 'superb', 'elegant', 're-creation', 'los', 'angeles', 'thirties', 'will', 'definitely', 'shine', 'eyes', 'contrast', 'coarse', 'vulgar', 'tone', 'present', 'fact', 'i', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'flaw', 'photography', 'work', 'shot', 'just', 'done', 'fantastically', 'finally', 'acting', 'four', 'protagonists', 'gave', 'powerful', 'performance', 'roles', 'have', 'act', 'least', 'two', 'roles', 'got', 'different', 'identities', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'armin', 'mueller-stahl', 'shine', 'gave', 'strong', 'performance', 'old', 'scientist', 'creator', 'simulated', 'world', 'gretchen', 'mol', 'starring', 'daughter', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'actresses', 'i', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'screen', 'be', 'very', 'versatile', 'actress', 'movie.for', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'matrix', 'try', 'also', 'watch', 'one', 'i', 'think', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'attention']",N/A

14979,A152C8GYY25HAH,0767819446,Matthew Horner,"[4, 4]","Hollywood has made a fortune recently on movies like The Matrix, The Mummy, The Haunting, The Blair Witch Project and The Sixth Sense. Each of these movies has, in its own way, questioned reality -- what is there and what isn't, what we think is there but isn't, and what isn't there, though we think it is. The Thirteenth Floor is similar, but it bombed at the boxoffice, no doubt because the distributor opened it too close to The Matrix, an admittedly superior movie. Still, this is a stylish little thriller, whose sole purpose is to entertain. Many critics were quick to point out that the story is utter nonsense, but I find that even many great movies fail the logic test.The time is the present. A genius computer programmer named Hannon Fuller [Armin Mueller-Stahl] has a company in Los Angeles that is developing an advanced virtual reality project. It's a sort of a game that takes place in the city in 1937. It's realism is so great that the participants believe they are actually in that time period when they are in the game. Then Fuller is brutally murdered. His right-hand man, Douglas Hall [Craig Bierko] is left in charge, but soon discovers that Fuller has been playing some complex games of his own, including leaving the clues to his killer's identity back in the computer's 1937 Los Angeles. Considered a suspect himself, Douglas must go into the game to unravel an ever evolving mystery. Our first assumption is that Fuller unleashed a monster when he created the program, but we then learn that this is only part of the answer.While The Thirteenth Floor is more of a thriller than it is a high tech special effects dazzler, there are some excellent recreations of old Los Angeles. The buildings may be somewhat more Art Deco than they really were, but they are pretty to look at. Computer generated trolleys cruise along the streets. The costumes, the sounds and the slang of that time are believable. In fact, the 1937 scenes often seem more authentic than the 1999 ones, but, considering the climax, that may have been done on purpose.One way to dramatically lower a film's cost is to cast it with actors who aren't several million dollars a pop. The Thirteenth Floor certainly went this route, though, without a single familiar star, this may have also impacted its income. This shouldn't matter to the viewer, because the cast is quite good. Craig Bierko does as a splendid job as Douglas and his two alter-egos. Gretchen Moll is believable as the beautiful Jane Fuller, who may or may not be Hannon's daughter. Despite its dismal financial performance, this is the kind of movie in which actors get noticed, and I expect to see a lot more of Bierko and Moll. The other major characters are played by performers you've seen a dozen times, but whose names you have never known.The Thirteenth Floor will not please everyone. It is, for example, a little too serious for its own good. The plot has a lot of twists and turns. The story is preposterous.

A good burger at some mom and pop shop does not need marketing to make it any better than what you can get at a national chain it is just simply better. The Thirteenth Floor is in my opinion better than Matrix simply because the acting is not so stylized.

That preceding sentence may as well be my username. In this case, it wasn't the overall thread of the story that was the problem, but individual scenes that were so unrealistically written/directed that I unfortunately have no choice but to assume that the movie makers were either 1) on drugs, or 2) just got off drugs.There's never been a movie where I look at the story and say, ""ok, that's just not believable, this story is just too over the top to take seriously."" I never say that. I'll respect any story someone wants to tell me as long as the movie follows some sort of internal logic, and has its characters reacting and interacting with their world in a manner that approaches some semblance of realism. This movie lacked exactly that, here are some examples:-When Ashton first finds out from Hall that his world is not real, he becomes *extremely* hostile and is ready to kill Hall. Why are you in such a hurry to off the ONE GUY that can give you more insight into this unbelievable revelation? You'll of course feel angry, but wouldn't you want to get more information on this first before you murder him, if you still plan on going that route?-One of the characters explained to Hall that when he was driving down the highway and eventually stopped, he was completely terrified by what he saw ahead of him (referring to the digital holographic structure that Hall would eventually see). Umm, a sane person would ask the next obvious question: ""WHAT DID YOU SEE?"" Why would you not ask that obvious followup question? Don't you want to know what he was so terrified by? Instead Hall keeps that same stupid worried look on his face.-When Hall is talking with the girl in the grocery store, the girl eventually asks, ""you're not from around here, are you?"", and tells Hall that he looks familiar. What the hell. If he looks familiar, then why is she assuming that he wouldn't be from around here? What kind of person even talks like that? Who was the script supervisor? Did they even have one, or was he one of the people on drugs?-When one of the characters gets pulled over by a cop, the cop asks for his driver's license. The character tells him he forgot it at home. The cop then says, ""check your glove box."" When was the last time you got pulled over, tell the cop you don't have your license/registration, and have the cop suggest you check your glove box?

What's reality?  What's reality?!Okay, so we've been here before.  Many many times before.  What is different about this movie is that it actually simplifies the situation by giving a solution to it.  In order to provide a sort of reasonable climax that isn't just throwing everything into the wind and saying, ""Haha, now you aren't certain, are you?"" this movie does what seems to be the blatantly obvious and gives the simulacrum a soul.THAT'S awesome because honestly it's nice to have a sort of direction for this philosophical discussion, and instead of making it, ""If they have a soul, what does that mean to us?"" it just ends with the, ""But they have a soul... leave them alone.""  This is a refreshing break from everything else along this topic we've been subject to.Unfortunately, that's about all that's good about this movie.  Flat acting holding up a slightly misappropriated pace centers around a story that seemed to struggle, really struggle to find a way to fit in at least a little violence and a love story.  A few blatant plot-holes coincide with a hidden enemy whose motivations are incredibly contrived and forced.

15005,A3TPJOEN2CVO36,0767819446,S. A. Felton,"[4, 4]","I hope I can write this review to recommend &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot; without giving the story away completely.Movies about alternate time tracks and realities have strangely become quite popular in the past couple of years, though science fiction writers have written about parallel worlds since at least the 1930's. I once wrote a term paper for a science fiction class on this subject and enjoyed the reading immensely! My favorite author in this genre was the late Phillip K. Dick. Two of his novels about parallel worlds were  &quot;The Man In The High Castle Castle&quot; and &quot;Ubik.&quot; Ironically Dick achieved some overdue fame as he was dying in 1982 when Hollywood released the well-done &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; based on one of his future-world novels.Developments in 20th century science have proven that time is in a sense an illusion, which parallels Eastern mysticism quite well. It is proveable that also in a sense events in the past, present, and future are going on at the same time. The fine, highly readable book, &quot;Parallel Universes,&quot; by Fred Alan Wolf, uses quantum physics to prove that in fact the future influences the present. While I feel that we should stay grounded in our present reality, it's also good for mind expansion to ponder the illusions of life. &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot; is the best movie I've seen that shows that time is an illusion, and offers questions and metaphors for various mysteries of existence, such as time, and &quot;who am I.&quot;&quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot; is ostensibly about a company that uses computers to travel to the past, to a simulated alternate reality, where the main characters play roles similar or different to their roles in what the movie portrays as &quot;present&quot; time. The computer program that creates the alternate world actually downloads the personality of the character in present time to the past reality, and there is a strange merger of personalities, the inner world of the human, vs. the outer world he lives in.Unfortunately there is a certain amount of violence in TTF, and in fact the murder of one of the scientists who created the world-generating computers is ostensibly the &quot;real&quot; mystery that drives the action. Yet from the beginning the mysteries of what is the &quot;real&quot; world, who are the &quot;real&quot; characters, combined with appropriate music and darkness in every scene until the last one, create many levels of mystery and intrigue. As the truth of what is really going on, which is the &quot;real&quot; world, is revealed to the protagonists, the illusion of what we think of as reality actually deepens! Again, I saw this realization of the illusion of reality to be an excellent metaphor for what is called &quot;maya&quot; in Eastern mysticism. The fact that computers (science) are the reality-generators is ironic to say the least!Unlike &quot;The Matrix,&quot; which features a very dreary &quot;real&quot; world behind the more pleasant reality we live in, &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot; ends in a message of hope, as the &quot;real&quot; reality turns out to be a very positive future.I've read some reviews about the poor acting in the movie, and I strongly beg to differ. The 4 or 5 main actors do an outstanding job with a very abstract script. Except for the police detective all the main characters play different roles/aspects of the same character very well. I also became a (big) fan of the beautiful Gretchen Mol, whom I had never seen in a movie previously.",4,Profound movie on many levels,978912000,"01 8, 2001",2001,3546,"['hope', 'can', 'write', 'review', 'recommend', 'quot', 'Thirteenth', 'Floor', 'quot', 'giving', 'story', 'away', 'alternate', 'time', 'tracks', 'realities', 'have', 'strangely', 'become', 'quite', 'popular', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'science', 'fiction', 'writers', 'have', 'written', 'parallel', 'worlds', 'least', '1930', 'once', 'wrote', 'term', 'paper', 'science', 'fiction', 'class', 'subject', 'enjoyed', 'reading', 'immensely', 'My', 'favorite', 'author', 'genre', 'was', 'late', 'Phillip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'Two', 'novels', 'parallel', 'worlds', 'were', 'quot', 'Man', 'High', 'Castle', 'Castle', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ubik.', 'quot', 'Ironically', 'Dick', 'achieved', 'overdue', 'fame', 'was', 'dying', '1982', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'released', 'well-done', 'quot', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'quot', 'based', 'one', 'future-world', 'novels.Developments', '20th', 'century', 'science', 'have', 'proven', 'time', 'sense', 'illusion', 'Eastern', 'mysticism', 'quite', 'well', 'proveable', 'also', 'sense', 'events', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'are', 'going', 'same', 'time', 'fine', 'highly', 'readable', 'book', 'quot', 'Parallel', 'Universes', 'quot', 'Fred', 'Alan', 'Wolf', 'quantum', 'physics', 'prove', 'fact', 'future', 'present', 'feel', 'should', 'stay', 'grounded', 'present', 'reality', 'also', 'good', 'mind', 'expansion', 'ponder', 'illusions', 'life', 'quot', 'Thirteenth', 'Floor', 'quot', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time', 'illusion', 'questions', 'metaphors', 'various', 'mysteries', 'existence', 'such', 'time', 'quot', 'who', 'am', 'I.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Thirteenth', 'Floor', 'quot', 'ostensibly', 'company', 'computers', 'travel', 'past', 'simulated', 'alternate', 'reality', 'where', 'main', 'characters', 'play', 'roles', 'similar', 'different', 'roles', 'what', 'movie', 'quot', 'present', 'quot', 'time', 'computer', 'program', 'alternate', 'world', 'actually', 'personality', 'character', 'present', 'time', 'past', 'reality', 'strange', 'merger', 'personalities', 'inner', 'world', 'human', 'outer', 'world', 'in.Unfortunately', 'certain', 'amount', 'violence', 'TTF', 'fact', 'murder', 'one', 'scientists', 'who', 'created', 'world-generating', 'computers', 'ostensibly', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'action', 'beginning', 'mysteries', 'what', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'world', 'who', 'are', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'characters', 'combined', 'appropriate', 'music', 'darkness', 'scene', 'last', 'one', 'create', 'many', 'levels', 'mystery', 'intrigue', 'truth', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'world', 'revealed', 'protagonists', 'illusion', 'what', 'think', 'reality', 'actually', 'Again', 'saw', 'realization', 'illusion', 'reality', 'be', 'excellent', 'metaphor', 'what', 'called', 'quot', 'quot', 'Eastern', 'mysticism', 'fact', 'computers', 'science', 'are', 'reality-generators', 'ironic', 'say', 'least', 'Unlike', 'quot', 'Matrix', 'quot', 'very', 'dreary', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'world', 'more', 'pleasant', 'reality', 'live', 'quot', 'Thirteenth', 'Floor', 'quot', 'message', 'hope', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'reality', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'positive', 'future.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'poor', 'acting', 'movie', 'strongly', 'beg', 'differ', '4', '5', 'main', 'actors', 'do', 'outstanding', 'job', 'very', 'abstract', 'script', 'police', 'detective', 'main', 'characters', 'play', 'different', 'roles/aspects', 'same', 'character', 'very', 'well', 'also', 'became', 'big', 'fan', 'beautiful', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'whom', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'previously']",N/A

The plot remains simple yet provocative, particularly after one encounters the plot twist near the end of the movie.And it is that plot twist that provides one of the reasons why I slip this DVD of this movie into my player twice as often as I do those other two films.....  With The Matrix and with Dark City, I am made to question the reality of the environment I live in; with The Thirteenth Floor, I am forced to examine the very foundation of my own existance. Deep concepts indeed...and from such a simple movie too!Besides that, I loved Fuller's 1937 simulation world, from the slightly sepia cast that colored everything, to the slightly edgy quality of the music in the cabaret (The program, like all computer programs, still had a few bugs in it....).OK...I will agree that the plot, though simple, still managed to show more depth than any of the characters within it ....and the scene at the very end of the film could have been fleshed out more.

Along with 'Dark City' which pre-dated 'The Matrix', it continues this variation on a theme and adds to the ontological angst upon which conspiracy theorists thrive. Adapted from the novel Simulacron 3 by Daniel F. Galouye, published over two decades earlier, it focuses on the sim/virtual reality shenanigans of an IT company whose CEO and founder, Hannon Fuller (Armin Muller-Stahl), is found dead shortly after the film opens. The `hero', played by Craig Bierko, falls under suspicion for his murder as he stands to inherit the company. The death is investigated by LAPD detective, Larry McBain, played by Dennis Haysbert.It's an okay watch, provided you can pick it up cheaply enough, but I can't quite put my finger on why it's no more than that. The production values are fine; the actors do their jobs well and the story's intriguing posing, as it does, the usual philosophical questions about the meaning of life, existence etc. Perhaps, it's because there are no star names present. I was reminded a little of Bradley Cooper's character in Limitless and it seems to me that he could have played this part well and given it a little bit of star quality.

I have known about this movie for a long time, but was always hesitant to see it, because when something like this appears in theaters 6 months after a groundbreaking film like the Matrix, you fully expect it to be a complete rip off. I was sitting at home flipping through the channels and saw the Matrix on, but I didn't wanna see it for the millionth time and decided to see if the Thirteenth Floor was streaming and sure it enough it was, and what a terrific story it turned out to be! In the year 2000, scientists have found a way to transfer a persons consciousness into a fully interactive computer program which has the potential to replace video games. The creator however has discovered a major problem with the system and is found dead. The second in charge of the project soon learns the answer to this brutal murder appears in the simulator, which is a replica of 1937. The story is absolutely ingenious and I loved how the film jumps between present day and the 1930s, it was like watching two stories at once that you knew would eventually come together. Craig Bierko stars in what turns out to be one of his few leading roles and he's just terrific. I remember him as the bad guy in the Long Kiss Goodnight and I thought he was great then, and he's great now. To make the cast even stronger, they take the intense Bierko and pair him with Law & Order's Vincent D'Onofrio, who is quite possibly the most intense actor in Hollywood. To top the whole thing off, this movie has a huge twist in the end, a twist that will make a lot of people wonder about the true nature of their own reality.
