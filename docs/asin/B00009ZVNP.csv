760379,APP5MBH2BSX6I,B00009ZVNP,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[32, 36]","The environmentally conscious Lorax appears here in an expanded version of the Dr. Seuss book, where we see more about how the profit-minded Once-Ler destroyed the truffula trees. My kindergartener loved the book, and I happened across this tape at Wal-Mart in a bargain bin. Having seen it as a kid myself, it was a natural purchase. She's watched it eight times in three days, so it must have stood the test of time! The music is a bit dated, sure, but she won't care about that for a few years yet, and it's pure nostalgia for my wife and me. The story even strikes the correct balance between commercial interests and environmentalism: Just take care of nature while you're creating jobs, and all will be well. But if you don't.....yikes.The forgotten story included here is about Pontoffel Pock, a loser of a young man who can't get his simple two-step job right and gets fired. He is given a magic piano so he can &quot;get away from it all,&quot; and of course he fouls that up too, but eventually figures out how to rescue a damsel in distress. My little girl doesn't quite get the romance aspect of this story, but we both enjoy the fantasy. Not in the league of &quot;The Lorax,&quot; but cute.",5,Just as charming as I remember,1090454400,"07 22, 2004",2004,1204,"['environmentally', 'conscious', 'Lorax', 'here', 'expanded', 'version', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'book', 'where', 'see', 'more', 'how', 'profit-minded', 'Once-Ler', 'destroyed', 'truffula', 'trees', 'kindergartener', 'loved', 'book', 'happened', 'tape', 'Wal-Mart', 'bargain', 'bin', 'Having', 'seen', 'kid', 'was', 'natural', 'purchase', 'watched', 'eight', 'times', 'three', 'days', 'must', 'have', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'music', 'bit', 'dated', 'sure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'few', 'years', 'yet', 'pure', 'nostalgia', 'wife', 'story', 'even', 'correct', 'balance', 'commercial', 'interests', 'environmentalism', 'Just', 'take', 'care', 'nature', ""'re"", 'creating', 'jobs', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", '..yikes.The', 'forgotten', 'story', 'included', 'here', 'Pontoffel', 'Pock', 'loser', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'simple', 'two-step', 'job', 'right', 'fired', 'given', 'magic', 'piano', 'can', 'quot', 'get', 'away', 'quot', 'course', 'up', 'too', 'eventually', 'out', 'how', 'rescue', 'damsel', 'distress', 'little', 'girl', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'romance', 'aspect', 'story', 'enjoy', 'fantasy', 'Not', 'league', 'quot', 'Lorax', 'quot', 'cute']",Dr. Seuss: The Lorax (also includes Dr. Seuss' Pontoffel Pock & His Magic Piano)

760381,A2QX49LS3Y3ANI,B00009ZVNP,Dienne,"[15, 20]","Let me start by saying that I absolutely love Dr. Seuss, and that the book version of The Lorax is my favorite of his works and quite possibly my favorite children's book ever.  My daughters' room has a 360 degree mural of scenes from the book, including the quote, ""Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better.  It's not.""But with that said, I just don't think that the video version lives up to the original book version.  Sure, it brings to life the same bright-color scenes and characters as in the book.  And sure, the video was produced by Dr. Seuss using much of the original text.  But the changes, in my opinion, make it worse rather than better.Many reviewers have described the video as an ""expanded"" version of the book, which it is to the extent that much extra material has been added - several songs, and extra scenes and dialogues that aren't found in the book.  I will admit that the songs are, for the most part, quite good and very catchy (almost too catchy - I get that ""Don't sit around talkin', just get to Weehawken"" song stuck in my head all the time).  But the extra material introduces significant changes to the narrative and not always for the best.  There's a scene, for instance, in which the Once-ler debates with himself - one side of him realizing that his business practices are not healthy.  There is nothing in the book to indicate that the Once-ler ever regretted any of his actions until the day that the last Truffula Tree fell and his business ended.There's also a new scene with a receptionist (Miss Funce-ler) and a secretary (Miss O'Schmunce-ler) in which he dictates a letter to his cousin Yani Yunce-ler.  This scene introduces a sexist element which doesn't exist in the book.  Yes, I realize it's a product of Dr. Seuss's time, and I realize that it's used as a way to portray typical corporate culture (which also isn't in the book), but I just don't think it adds any value to the video.  In fact, I think the whole corporate culture addition was over the top, and certainly goes over the heads of the children who are the main viewers of this video.But not only has material been added to the video, but material from the book has also been taken out.  For instance, we lose the whole scene about how the boy has to pay the Once-ler ""fifteen cents and a nail and the shell of a great-great-grandfather snail"" and how the Once-ler puts that money into the ""Snuvv"" of his ""gruvvulous glove"" and how he then speaks by Whisper-Ma-Phone.  This omission affects the characterization of the Once-ler's voice.  In the video he sounds just like you might expect some corporate tycoon to sound.  But according to the book, his ""whispers are not very clear, since they have to come down through a long snergelly hose, and he sounds as if he had smallish bees up his nose.""In general, I think that the changes and substitutions in the video dialogue lose much of the poetic fluidity and humor of the text in the book version.And with all that said, I realize I'm analyzing this way too deeply for a children's video - my disappointment is just the wistfulness of a Seuss purist.  My daughter likes the video just fine (in fact, she's had it on endless repeat in the car for the past several weeks), although she too misses the early scenes I mentioned.  This video is a good compliment to the book, but I wouldn't substitute it for the book.",3,Don't mess with perfection,1288915200,"11 5, 2010",2010,3415,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'absolutely', 'love', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'book', 'version', 'Lorax', 'favorite', 'works', 'quite', 'possibly', 'favorite', 'children', 'book', 'ever', 'daughters', 'room', '360', 'degree', 'mural', 'scenes', 'book', 'including', 'quote', 'someone', 'cares', 'whole', 'awful', 'lot', 'nothing', 'going', 'get', 'better', 'not', 'said', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'video', 'version', 'up', 'original', 'book', 'version', 'Sure', 'life', 'same', 'bright-color', 'scenes', 'characters', 'book', 'sure', 'video', 'was', 'produced', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'using', 'much', 'original', 'text', 'changes', 'opinion', 'make', 'worse', 'rather', 'better.Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'described', 'video', 'expanded', 'version', 'book', 'extent', 'much', 'extra', 'material', 'been', 'added', 'several', 'songs', 'extra', 'scenes', 'dialogues', 'are', ""n't"", 'found', 'book', 'will', 'admit', 'songs', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'quite', 'good', 'very', 'catchy', 'almost', 'too', 'catchy', 'get', 'Do', ""n't"", 'sit', 'around', 'talkin', 'just', 'get', 'Weehawken', 'song', 'stuck', 'head', 'time', 'extra', 'material', 'introduces', 'significant', 'changes', 'narrative', 'not', 'always', 'best', 'scene', 'instance', 'Once-ler', 'debates', 'one', 'side', 'realizing', 'business', 'practices', 'are', 'not', 'healthy', 'nothing', 'book', 'indicate', 'Once-ler', 'ever', 'regretted', 'actions', 'day', 'last', 'Truffula', 'Tree', 'fell', 'business', 'also', 'new', 'scene', 'receptionist', 'Miss', 'Funce-ler', 'secretary', 'Miss', ""O'Schmunce-ler"", 'letter', 'cousin', 'Yani', 'Yunce-ler', 'scene', 'sexist', 'element', ""n't"", 'exist', 'book', 'Yes', 'realize', 'product', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'time', 'realize', 'used', 'way', 'portray', 'typical', 'corporate', 'culture', 'also', ""n't"", 'book', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'value', 'video', 'fact', 'think', 'whole', 'corporate', 'culture', 'addition', 'was', 'top', 'certainly', 'heads', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'main', 'viewers', 'video.But', 'not', 'only', 'material', 'been', 'added', 'video', 'material', 'book', 'also', 'been', 'taken', 'out', 'instance', 'lose', 'whole', 'scene', 'how', 'boy', 'pay', 'Once-ler', 'fifteen', 'cents', 'nail', 'shell', 'great-great-grandfather', 'snail', 'how', 'Once-ler', 'money', 'Snuvv', 'gruvvulous', 'glove', 'how', 'then', 'Whisper-Ma-Phone', 'omission', 'characterization', 'Once-ler', 'voice', 'video', 'just', 'might', 'expect', 'corporate', 'tycoon', 'sound', 'according', 'book', 'whispers', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'clear', 'have', 'come', 'down', 'long', 'snergelly', 'hose', 'had', 'smallish', 'bees', 'nose', 'general', 'think', 'changes', 'substitutions', 'video', 'dialogue', 'lose', 'much', 'poetic', 'fluidity', 'humor', 'text', 'book', 'version.And', 'said', 'realize', ""'m"", 'analyzing', 'way', 'too', 'deeply', 'children', 'video', 'disappointment', 'just', 'wistfulness', 'Seuss', 'purist', 'daughter', 'video', 'just', 'fine', 'fact', 'had', 'endless', 'repeat', 'car', 'past', 'several', 'weeks', 'too', 'early', 'scenes', 'mentioned', 'video', 'good', 'compliment', 'book', 'would', ""n't"", 'substitute', 'book']",Dr. Seuss: The Lorax (also includes Dr. Seuss' Pontoffel Pock & His Magic Piano)

Obviously Ted Geisel (Dr. Seuss) had many different things on his mind when he wrote The Lorax. While many kids enjoy this story, many of them, most likely, will not be able to see one of the messages Dr. Seuss incorporated into the story: Corporate greed.The cartoon is very well done, but I noticed extreme color fadings on the cartoon. It's not as crisp and bright as the ones I've seen growing up. In fact, this is the worst presentation I've seen The Lorax in. There are also a few scenes where the color finally gets brighter, but then a few seconds later, it turns to dull coloring again.I have not seen the second cartoon on this DVD but plan to soon.In a nutshell, The Lorax is a fine cartoon.
