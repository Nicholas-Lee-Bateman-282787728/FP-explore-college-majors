242685,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6301008901,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 11/13Rate: 911/13: This is Mickey Rourke at the top of his game in Barfly. If there is any doubt about his acting ability, it can be laid to rest by seeing this one along with his other brilliant performances during the 80's in Rumble Fish, 9  Weeks, Angel Heart, Year of the Dragon, Johnny Handsome, and Wild Orchid (sorry, I am not too much of a fan of The Pope of Greenwich Village). Mickey Rourke steals the show from start to finish in Barfly and is able to outshine Faye Dunaway in every scene who is a highly respectable actress. What helps the film the most is the writing by Charles Bukowski to make the cynosure alcoholic a tolerable character because films like The Lost Weekend and Leaving Las Vegas fall apart since they feature uninteresting, unsympathetic drunks. There is plenty of character in Mickey Rourke's drunk, and he seems to view life through a different looking-glass. If one would look at Mickey Rourke in other films in terms of how he acts, walks, and behaves, there is a dramatic transformation in all aspects in Barfly. Hence, it is a shock he went from John in 9  Weeks to Henry in Barfly one year later. That's why Barfly may as well be the best work Mickey Rourke has ever done in his career although his John of 9  Weeks and Randy the Ram of The Wrestler are of worthy mention. All in all, Mickey Rourke shows in Barfly why he is almost in the same class as Marlon Brando.",5,Mickey Rourke's Best.,1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,1415,"['Viewed', '11/13Rate', '911/13', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'top', 'game', 'Barfly', 'doubt', 'acting', 'ability', 'can', 'be', 'laid', 'rest', 'seeing', 'one', 'along', 'other', 'brilliant', 'performances', '80', 'Rumble', 'Fish', '9', 'Weeks', 'Angel', 'Heart', 'Year', 'Dragon', 'Johnny', 'Handsome', 'Wild', 'Orchid', 'sorry', 'am', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'fan', 'Pope', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'show', 'start', 'finish', 'Barfly', 'able', 'outshine', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'scene', 'who', 'highly', 'respectable', 'actress', 'What', 'film', 'most', 'writing', 'Charles', 'Bukowski', 'make', 'cynosure', 'tolerable', 'character', 'films', 'Lost', 'Weekend', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'fall', 'apart', 'feature', 'uninteresting', 'unsympathetic', 'drunks', 'plenty', 'character', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'drunk', 'view', 'life', 'different', 'looking-glass', 'one', 'would', 'look', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'other', 'films', 'terms', 'how', 'walks', 'behaves', 'dramatic', 'transformation', 'aspects', 'Barfly', 'Hence', 'shock', 'went', 'John', '9', 'Weeks', 'Henry', 'Barfly', 'one', 'year', 'later', 'why', 'Barfly', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'best', 'work', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'ever', 'done', 'career', 'John', '9', 'Weeks', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'Wrestler', 'are', 'worthy', 'mention', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Barfly', 'why', 'almost', 'same', 'class', 'Marlon', 'Brando']",N/A

Nonconformists and those who like to look at things differently than the ""regular consensus"" might appreciate this film the most.Yet it is not strange or uncommon. It is brilliantly honest and truthful in a way few films are. It is (somewhat) based on a portion of the life of Charles Bukowski who wrote the screenplay and claimed not to feel the film portrayed what he was really like. It actually probably flattered him a bit much, as Rourke was incredibly attractive somehow in this role. Cinematic magic indeed. Faye Dunaway was also par excellence in her role as an over-the-hill female drunk barfly.However this movie is WAY too expensive no matter how good it is. Therefore it really needs to be re-released. With the release of the DVD of this film in 2002 the company that released it make way too few copies. They did not realize what a TRUE CLASSIC they have on their hands. They need to realize this and re-release it so that the common folk can afford to buy a copy too. You can sign an online petition to this effect by Googling ""barfly dvd petition.""

This is certainly the best of his movie and the least recognized or known. His acting in this film is absolutely Oscar material, yet the movie was never properly marketed. What else can we expect from Cappola's film and detail of perfection in cinematography.Mickey's lunatic acting is so powerful and convincing that you feel as part of the film. The set captures a real decadence of losers who drink themselves into oblivion while facing their daily inner dragons. This film will be loved and enjoyed by all, its strong, sentimental, intellectual, and gives us a sense of what's being down and under its all about.Mickey again delivers an outstanding performance with Faye Dunaway who shares the sentiments of Mickey's bizarre alcoholic behavior without having to excuse himself or justify his excessive drinking. The drama unfolds with true scenes of short conflicts, passion, comedy, and profound poetry that will mesmerize all audiences. This film would be admired by all Shakespeare fans...The film is super entertaining, profound, melancholic and will certainly live you amazed in what classic films should be all about!

242694,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,6301008901,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[1, 3]","Gonzo poet, writer, rebel, wild man and veteran Barfly without peer Charles Bukowski cranked out the script and guerilla filmmaker Barbet Schroeder wielded the camera for this pungent, wicked, hysterical tale of Hell itself: it is nothing other than the Damned with Drinks and the Dive Bar as steaming Hellpit. It's also huge tanker truckloads of fun.Drink up, the rounds are on me!Mickey Rourke, then at the height of his powers, plays Bukowski stand-in and poet-genius-drunkard Henry Chinaski, who would love to write fantastic world-famous poetry and become wildly wealthy and idle his days away listening to Handel and chumming on caviar---but you know, a man's gotta have a First Love, and Henry does: Lady Booze, and boy is Henry faithful.What they hey! It's much easier to head down to the local watering hole, you know, and have just one shot. Just one shot.Just one, c'mon Man, you know?Consequently Henry is witty, sharp, caustic, totally disgusting, lives in a rat & cockroach infested flophouse, has meandering chatter sessions and fumbled sleepwalker sex with fellow drunkard Wanda Wilcox (Faye Dunaway who looks all bleary-eyed and tilts that bottle back like a champ! You go, girl!), and passes out in his own urine.Publisher Tully Sorenson (Alice Krige, at the height of her powers and still eleven years away from her role as Borg Queen) discovers Henry: she's shocked by his nastiness and, simultaneously, by his genius. She wants to publish his poems. She wants to throw a life preserver down to Henry, with which he can escape the big old wine-dark sea of Old Grand-Dad in which he swims.Guess what happens? Yeah, that's right, have another drink.Anyway, underrated genius Barbet Schroeder and Charles Bukowski make a kind of diabolic duo in turning out this rummy-headed little epic of mind-boggling personal destruction. I don't know about Barbet (though the guy must have been fortifying himself with whiskey when he shot the amazing documentary ""General Idi Amin Dada"", which if you haven't seen, you should---hell, make it a double feature with ""Barfly""), but Bukowski, who drank his way around the world---from Nazi Germany to seedy back alley L.A. dive bars---over the course of his 74 years on the planet---knows himself and knows his Enemy. His expertise shows.The dialogue is funny and rings true. And cinematographer Robert Muller is just too cool for school here: you can practically feel the grime and smell the stale sweet rank stench of sour whiskey and sweat. And hey!---Buk himself puts in an appearance as a bar patron. Hey there, is that glass empty?The acting is all first-rate: Mickey Rourke completely owns this movie. Completely. He actually pulls it off: he makes the life of a half-crazed almost totally out of his mind teeth-grinding wild-man look glamorous.I bought it. Faye Dunaway carries off the role of her career. Krige looks like a sturdy, stoic tugboat hitched to the stern of a swiftly sinking Titanic. Frank Stallone shows up as the angry barman! Jack Nance (of ""Twin Peaks"" fame and loyal David Lynch stable actor) puts in an appearance as the tricky detective. The script is crisp and crackles and rocks and rolls: frankly, I think this one gives David Mamet a run for his money; see if you don't agree.In the end, we get to laugh it up and share a round or two or three---um, or four---with people who are disintegrating before our eyes, albeit in the funniest, most completely honest way possible. Henry is totally right: ""Anyone can be a non-drunk: it takes a special talent to be a drunk---it takes endurance."" That much is true: Henry and Wanda's ""life"" is chewing them up.Why this is Hell, nor am I out of it.

242695,A32BJZRK8CVNDK,6301008901,DarrelR.,"[0, 0]","I first saw this movie in 1989 and loved it immediately.  Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunaway were excellent as the main characters.  I have never read the writings of Charles Bukowski, but maybe one day I will.  The description on the cover of the Disc makes this out to be a very sad and depressing movie.  Far from the truth!  It is a hilarious and satirical take on life, and should be viewed as such.

His convictions are tested when a beautiful young magazine editor (Alice Krige) arrives to purchase one of his stories.  She sees him as a brilliant, primitive talent and attempts to ""save"" him by offering money, luxury, and herself.

Most of the movie is dull and stilted and some parts are embarrassing to watch. Faye Dunaway plays Henry's lover, but even she cannot bring any magic to the screen. The problem with 'Barfly' is that it does not allow any kind of spontaneity or improvisation from the actors.I could tell while watching it that the characters were reading lines from the screenplay and not coming up with anything original on their own. When people are getting drunk at the bar, they can say some pretty ridiculous, funny, or even profound things. This movie had none of that. The filmmaker should have gotten the actors drunk and then filmed what happened. The might have been more interesting than what the screenplay had to offer. 'Barfly' had some interesting ideas to explore, but it failed miserably at every single one of them. Also, the movie has a happy ending.

He writes gritty, raw poems, filled with the hunger of his impoverished, addicted existence.  He stokes his fires with alcohol, starts quixotic battles, and then usually crawls home drunk and beaten.Rather than manipulate the audience's sympathies or try to come up with a pat, satisfying ending that provides a moral and an uplift, author Bukowski and director Schroder make Rourke's poet neither wholly tragic nor wholly heroic, neither genuinely likeable nor genuinely despicable.

Back in 1987 I was an 18 year-old suburbanite on the verge of college and, without knowing it, many great discoveries. This would be one of the most enduring. I went to see it because I had loved Rourke in ANGEL HEART. I had no idea what to expect, I had never read Bukowski and only knew the name from a couple of songs that mentioned him. Rourke was absolutely fantastic in the film...I'd never seen a charcter like this (and haven't since). But what hit me was the writing--the script--how the life of down-and-outers could be so compelling and human and humorous. These bums weren't to be pitied, laughed at, or condemned. Wow. Since no bookstores in Fresno sold Bukowski I had to check out his books at the CSUF library, and thank God they had them all. POST OFFICE was the first, and I immediately saw the same wild humor from BARFLY. I've been hooked ever since, and to this day anxiously await each new Buk book. I also wish someone would turn either POST OFFICE, WOMEN, or HAM ON RYE into a movie. Paul Verhoeven had supposedly started shooting WOMEN back in the early '90s. What happened. Taylor Hackford has never filmed PO, which he owns the film rights to. Bits of HAM ON RYE are in the Belgian film LOVE IS A DOG FROM HELL (CRAZY LOVE). Someone out there in tinseltown has got to be able to do Buk justice and not let BARFLY be the only worthwhile bit of filmdom attributed to him (forget about the utterly disappointing TALES OF ORDINARY MADNESS, Gazzara is awful, and the script is filled with pomposity that would make Buk himself puke).

In a film that is both dingy and bright, Rourke staggers from the screen a pickled genius and gives a stellar performance as the hard-drinking, alley-brawling, pickup line-snarling Henry.The fact is, you get the sense that Rourke is not acting at all. He is the reckless but generally happy drunk with a flair for words floating around in the alcoholic foam. You can smell the boozy breath and unwashed clothes as he staggers from bar to bar, a man at peace with this misspent life. Almost at peace, anyway. Because Henry, like Bukowski, has an enormous talent for prose that just won't float away on river of booze.Henry's life is only mildly altered by the appearance of Wanda, a fellow drinker living on the ragged edge between drunkeness and sobriety. She has a job, after all, and that sets her apart from the other barflies, who are afforded the luxery of running the bars all hours of all days. Faye Dunaway is amazing in this movie. Her beauty is not vanquished in the role, but is rubbed away some as if by the eraser of hard years and hard living. She is as devoted to Henry as she is to her alcoholism. And when a stranger from beyond their world, a bright and clean stranger from the glitzy universe of publishing comes among them, Wanda is territorial and threatened. Henry, on the other hand, is bemused and only vaguely flattered that someone has expressed an interest in his literature. He dreams, not of bestsellers lists and fancy dinners, but of a quick buck to sustain the lifestyle with which he has become quite comfortable.""Barfly"" teaches a great lesson about alcoholics. They are not all drunk beyond intellect and blindly resigned to the lifestyle of liquor. Many possess talents that sober men only dream of. And many would not jump into the opulence and safety of the sober word if given the opportunity. Some of these great drinkers are quite content down there in the mud and beer, with their genius tucked away some place secret, like something stashed in a battered knapsack.""Barfly"" is a weaving, grungy look at genius, at love, and at the  strange social interactions among those that reside in what some mistakenly refer to as the subculture.See this movie at once.

It's sort of like One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest that way.  It's about badly broken and disturbed people, but manages to portray them sympathetically and simply as flawed human beings.  This is what I love about it.The scene where Rourke sits down next to Dunaway at the bar for the first time is pure genius!  &#34;I hate people,&#34;she says.  &#34;Don't you hate them?&#34;  &#34;No, but I seem to feel better when they're not around,&#34; says Rourke.  And the rest of the conversations go on like that, quite witty and nicely written.The movie Factotum was much more concerned with showing us the depression and the grime of these types of characters.  In short, a far less superior film, in my opinion.  There is a dark side to Bukowski, indeed, but also very much a bright side.  And I think that sums up life, really.  Can't have the light without the dark.  You should see this film immediately.  Copies of it are hard to come by now.  But you can still get bootleg copies from the internet, or stream it from this website or others, or simply watch it on Youtube.  I believe it is still there, in its entirety.

242726,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6301008901,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 8]","Barfly (Barbet Schroeder, 1987)When I was a young poet, like most people who became young poets in the seventies and eighties, one of my idols was Charles Bukowski. So when Barfly came out, I rushed to see it, and was awed. I've carried the nostalgia for it around for twenty years, and finally decided to see it again. Somewhat to my surprise, I found I'd been looking at it through rather rose-colored glasses all this time.Watching it now, the biggest problem with the movie is Mickey Rourke, whose hipster-wannabe portrayal of Bukowski's alter ego Henry Chinaski draws far more from Arthur Fonzarelli than the Beats (not that Bukowski ever identified with the Beats). When he's on his game, Rourke is a fantastic actor, but here he overacts the role to death, creating a thoroughly unbelievable character.While critics of the film during its original release were quick to point out that it mirrors Bukowski's writings (""depressing and pointless"", my mother's favorite radio talk show host called it), and I took that at face value twenty years ago, I'm not so sure it's the case now. While the atmosphere is certainly close enough for jazz, and all the little quirks that make Bukowski's life filmable pop up, the major contradictions of which those quirks were symptomatic don't put in much of an appearance. People in the film address the central concept that Buk was, in fact, a whole lot smarter than everyone around him, but Rourke's portrayal never brings that to light. A lot of people ask why he chooses to live as a bum, but neither Rourke nor Schroeder is quick to offer an answer. To be fair, Buk might not have had one, but his writings and interviews from the period during which he wrote the screenplay would suggest otherwise. I think the film was meant as an answer, and it simply didn't come through.As usual where nostalgia is concerned, the product doesn't match the memory of the product. **",2,20 Years Later: Not nearly as good as I remember.,1185926400,"08 1, 2007",2007,1916,"['Barfly', 'Barbet', 'Schroeder', '1987', 'When', 'was', 'young', 'poet', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'became', 'young', 'poets', 'seventies', 'eighties', 'one', 'idols', 'was', 'Charles', 'Bukowski', 'So', 'when', 'Barfly', 'came', 'out', 'rushed', 'see', 'was', 'awed', ""'ve"", 'carried', 'nostalgia', 'twenty', 'years', 'finally', 'decided', 'see', 'again', 'Somewhat', 'surprise', 'found', ""'d"", 'been', 'looking', 'rather', 'rose-colored', 'glasses', 'time.Watching', 'now', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'hipster-wannabe', 'portrayal', 'Bukowski', 'alter', 'ego', 'Henry', 'Chinaski', 'far', 'more', 'Arthur', 'Fonzarelli', 'Beats', 'not', 'Bukowski', 'ever', 'identified', 'Beats', 'When', 'game', 'Rourke', 'fantastic', 'actor', 'here', 'role', 'death', 'creating', 'thoroughly', 'unbelievable', 'character.While', 'critics', 'film', 'original', 'release', 'were', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'Bukowski', 'writings', 'depressing', 'pointless', 'mother', 'favorite', 'radio', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'called', 'took', 'face', 'value', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'case', 'now', 'atmosphere', 'certainly', 'close', 'enough', 'jazz', 'little', 'quirks', 'make', 'Bukowski', 'life', 'filmable', 'pop', 'up', 'major', 'contradictions', 'quirks', 'were', 'symptomatic', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'much', 'appearance', 'People', 'film', 'central', 'concept', 'Buk', 'was', 'fact', 'whole', 'lot', 'smarter', 'everyone', 'Rourke', 'portrayal', 'never', 'light', 'lot', 'people', 'ask', 'why', 'live', 'bum', 'Rourke', 'Schroeder', 'quick', 'offer', 'answer', 'be', 'fair', 'Buk', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'one', 'writings', 'interviews', 'period', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'would', 'suggest', 'otherwise', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'meant', 'answer', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'through.As', 'usual', 'where', 'nostalgia', 'concerned', 'product', ""n't"", 'match', 'memory', 'product', '**']",N/A

Mickey Rourke delivers a beautifully realized performance as Henry Chinaski - the alter-ego of poet Charles Bukowski (who wrote the screenplay based on his own experiences). The unkempt actor has the time of his life as a philosophic survivor whose pain and misery are revealed in his poetry. ""Barfly"" is a world-weary mixture of humor and reality without self-pity. Directed with gritty authenticity by Barbet Schroeder, viewers can experience the empty glasses, burned-out cigarettes and dark booths that inhabit the seedy tavern atmosphere.

He meets up with Dunaway who is a down and out lush and the bond on the one thing they have in common...drinking.

Hollywood memories sure hurt us Senior citizens who lived in early Hollywood. Things change don't they? THE SIDESHOW is one, bar front, shown at the opening credits. It was near the Paramount theater, now named the El Capitan, across from Grauman's. When I  first moved to Hollywood, I lived above The Sideshow Bar at Hollywood and Highland. It was the Park Hotel and now it is a Hostel for tourists, reopened after more than 20 years of being closed. Hollywood Bars in the late 50's early 60's, resembled home town bars across the country. All gone now. So when you watch BARFLY it was in this era that is now gone.
