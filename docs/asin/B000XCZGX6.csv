1114034,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B000XCZGX6,A. Gammill,"[80, 82]","Note: This review contains SPOILERS.This is an issue that has divided Beauty & The Beast fans for almost twenty years, and reading the reviews here, I can see a lot of people are still bitter. While the show certainly suffered the loss of Linda Hamilton, I personally found there was still plenty to enjoy in this abbreviated season.For one thing, the season-long story arc served the show quite well. The second season's cliffhanger ending left a lot for the writers to explore. So much fuss was made way back in 1989 about the show being ""retooled"" to attract more male viewers. And I'll admit, there's probably a sizable portion of the potential male viewing audience that is attracted to the increased action and violence. But was the show really THAT different? We still have Ron Perlman and all the others giving it their all (and it was quite an emotional and yes, violent arc for Vincent). The late, talented Edward Albert got moved into a series regular slot. And I can't think of another series villain as vile as Stephen McHattie's Gabriel. And for you action fans, there's Lance Henriksen's appearance as the vicious assassin, Snow.Even amid all the death and sorrow, there are moments of beauty. ""Walk Slowly,"" the follow-up to the 2-hour season premiere, is one of the best-written episodes of the entire series. Jo Anderson is no Linda Hamilton, but she evidences real concern and determination to help Vincent. And the return of Rolley (from season two's ""Chamber Music"") evokes sympathy, as well as reminds us that there was always more to this fictional universe than just Vincent and Catherine.To the uninitiated who may not have seen this season: It's really not as bad as many people would have you believe. If you accept that Linda Hamilton only appears in 2 episodes, maybe that will lessen your potential disappointment. And if you've followed the story this far, it just makes sense to see it through to the end. No, it's NOT as good as the first two years. But it's still a great show, and I hope you will give it a chance.The only other concern I have, as others have pointed out, is that the asking price for a shortened (12 episodes) season is the same as for a full season.  But as any true fan will tell you, it's something of a minor miracle that we're finally getting season 3 on home video in ANY format.  I'm grateful for that, and I have no hesitation in shelling out the $$ to complete my set.",4,Still plenty of good stuff here,1197936000,"12 18, 2007",2007,2430,"['Note', 'review', 'SPOILERS.This', 'issue', 'divided', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'fans', 'almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'reading', 'reviews', 'here', 'can', 'see', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'bitter', 'show', 'certainly', 'suffered', 'loss', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'personally', 'found', 'was', 'still', 'plenty', 'enjoy', 'abbreviated', 'season.For', 'one', 'thing', 'season-long', 'story', 'arc', 'served', 'show', 'quite', 'well', 'second', 'season', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'left', 'lot', 'writers', 'explore', 'So', 'much', 'fuss', 'was', 'made', 'way', 'back', '1989', 'show', 'being', 'retooled', 'attract', 'more', 'male', 'viewers', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'probably', 'sizable', 'portion', 'potential', 'male', 'viewing', 'audience', 'attracted', 'increased', 'action', 'violence', 'was', 'show', 'really', 'different', 'still', 'have', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'others', 'giving', 'was', 'quite', 'emotional', 'yes', 'violent', 'arc', 'Vincent', 'late', 'talented', 'Edward', 'Albert', 'got', 'moved', 'series', 'regular', 'slot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'series', 'villain', 'as', 'vile', 'Stephen', 'McHattie', 'Gabriel', 'action', 'fans', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'appearance', 'vicious', 'assassin', 'Snow.Even', 'death', 'sorrow', 'are', 'moments', 'beauty', 'Walk', 'Slowly', 'follow-up', '2-hour', 'season', 'premiere', 'one', 'best-written', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series', 'Jo', 'Anderson', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'real', 'concern', 'determination', 'help', 'Vincent', 'return', 'Rolley', 'season', 'two', 'Chamber', 'Music', 'sympathy', 'as', 'well', 'reminds', 'was', 'always', 'more', 'fictional', 'universe', 'just', 'Vincent', 'Catherine.To', 'uninitiated', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'season', 'really', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'accept', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'only', '2', 'episodes', 'maybe', 'will', 'lessen', 'potential', 'disappointment', ""'ve"", 'followed', 'story', 'far', 'just', 'sense', 'see', 'end', 'No', 'NOT', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'years', 'still', 'great', 'show', 'hope', 'will', 'give', 'chance.The', 'only', 'other', 'concern', 'have', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'asking', 'price', 'shortened', '12', 'episodes', 'season', 'same', 'full', 'season', 'true', 'fan', 'will', 'tell', 'something', 'minor', 'miracle', ""'re"", 'finally', 'getting', 'season', '3', 'home', 'video', 'ANY', 'format', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'have', 'hesitation', 'shelling', 'out', 'complete', 'set']",Beauty and the Beast - The Final Season

1114038,A18BB57HXG08E6,B000XCZGX6,"Arissa ""Arissa""","[9, 11]","""Beauty and the Beast"" in its third season faced the same dilemma that hit ""The X-Files."" In both cases, a principal character around whom the series was based lost the actors (Linda Hamilton and David Duchovney, respectively) who were indelibly linked with that character. Fans would not have accepted a new Fox Mulder and the X Files without him truly lost its formerly brilliant way.But I do not feel this was true with ""Beauty and the Beast.""  Although, like everyeone, I loved the special romance of our favorite beast man and Catherine, there really wasn't an undending array of story lines that the romance could have realistically sustained. (I have heard series writer/producer confess to this very difficulty.)The writers had already explored many of the problems that Catherine and Vincent's impossible affair created.  Where could they have taken it in the long haul?  Add that to the fact that their lead actress pulled out and they faced an interesting situation: Let the show die forever or continue to explore the ramifications of a Vincent tormented by the loss of Catherine.I for one was far more attracted to the show because of Vincent than I ever was for Catherine.  He was its heart and soul, his poetic and haunted character the reason I tuned in every week.  I did not want to lose him, even without his beauty.  Ron Perlman was simply wonderful in the role of a lifetime.  I was perfectly willing to watch what might become of him in light of his tragedy.  Like others, I was deeply touched by the bonds between Elliot Burch (always a plus on the show) and Joe and Vincent in their united fight against the man who murdered the woman they all loved.  And Gabriel was a delicious villain. (Gabriels seem to make splendid villains, as any Dorothy Dunnett fan can attest.)I for one really liked Diana! I thought she had grit and integrity. I also think that falling in love with someone who was himself grieving for the loss of the love of his life was itself high romance and I really felt for her plight.  I would not have wanted a romance to blossom too quickly, but to me, her love for him (we all loved him; why shouldn't the new chick?) and his struggle to be loyal to his memories of Catherine and yet try to find happiness in a world without her were far more intriguing possibilities that what the writers were facing with Vincent and Catherine alone.I didn't like having the baby around.  Never a good idea.  But I commend everyone associated with the third season for a handful of episodes with high drama, passion, poignancy and, most of all, their gallant attempt to keep Vincent in my life.  Those of you who thrive only on the bright and lovely side of a great love may not find season three to be your cup of tea. But the rest of you, drink up!

(Yes, I plan to buy it even though I am only giving it two stars), but I feel I can still offer a review of this season because I've never quite gotten over the disappointment. I hated what the writers did to the romance of Catherine and Vincent; I could never understand why they lost their bond after they made love. I'm hoping that by viewing the episodes back to back without commercial interuption the reasoning behind that plot development might be clearer (although I must admit to being doubtful on that point). I wish they they would have simply recast the role of Catherine and ended the plot on a much higher note.I think they could have put the woman they cast as Diana in Catherine's role. She had a luminous beauty and a subtelty and sensitivity that Hamilton's often lacked during the series due to her struggles with drug addiction. (I know a lot of fans will hate me for mentioning her addiction but she has admitted that she had a problem and admire her for taking action to get her life back on track).Because of the way Catherine and Vincent's bond was severed by their intimacy, the cruel way in which they were separated and unable to be togther and enjoy the pregnancy and birth of their son, and the cold harsh way Catherine's life ended, I can only give this season a two-star rating.",2,I still wish for a better ending,1196726400,"12 4, 2007",2007,1400,"['course', 'everyone', 'else', 'am', 'still', 'waiting', 'thris', 'season', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'Yes', 'plan', 'buy', 'even', 'am', 'only', 'giving', 'two', 'stars', 'feel', 'can', 'still', 'offer', 'review', 'season', ""'ve"", 'never', 'quite', 'gotten', 'over', 'disappointment', 'hated', 'what', 'writers', 'did', 'romance', 'Catherine', 'Vincent', 'could', 'never', 'understand', 'why', 'lost', 'bond', 'made', 'love', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'viewing', 'episodes', 'back', 'back', 'commercial', 'interuption', 'reasoning', 'plot', 'development', 'might', 'be', 'clearer', 'must', 'admit', 'being', 'doubtful', 'point', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'simply', 'recast', 'role', 'Catherine', 'ended', 'plot', 'much', 'higher', 'note.I', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'woman', 'cast', 'Diana', 'Catherine', 'role', 'had', 'luminous', 'beauty', 'subtelty', 'sensitivity', 'Hamilton', 'often', 'lacked', 'series', 'due', 'struggles', 'drug', 'addiction', 'know', 'lot', 'fans', 'will', 'hate', 'mentioning', 'addiction', 'admitted', 'had', 'problem', 'admire', 'taking', 'action', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'track', '.Because', 'way', 'Catherine', 'Vincent', 'bond', 'was', 'severed', 'intimacy', 'cruel', 'way', 'were', 'separated', 'unable', 'be', 'togther', 'enjoy', 'pregnancy', 'birth', 'son', 'cold', 'harsh', 'way', 'Catherine', 'life', 'ended', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'season', 'two-star', 'rating']",Beauty and the Beast - The Final Season

And it didn't help that she wasn't ""Catherine.""What I do remember, vividly, is the relationship that developed between Vincent and Elliot Burch. For me, the third season was wonderful and wonderous because it showed love enduring. Both men loved Catherine and Catherine loved both of them -- though Burch's feet of clay prevented her from having a deeper relationship with him. (The first season episode where he's introduced even has Vincent acknowledging that Catherine is falling in love with Burch, so please don't think I'm being heretical.)Seeing how loving Catherine changed Burch and made it possible for Vincent, and, to a lesser extent Joe Malone, to work with him was for me the ultimate affirmation of the value and purpose of love.All the men who loved Catherine, forged a bond through her.

Stephen McHattie great turn as Vincent's archnemesis served the story well and gave it a strong, compelling focus that it was sorely lacking.

1114054,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B000XCZGX6,kacunnin,"[47, 49]","The 3rd season of Beauty and the Beast definitely takes the series in a very different direction.  As the new opening reveals, once Vincent gets past Catherine's murder he will dedicate his life to avenging injustice - in other words, he has been recast here as a sort of beastly Batman, searching the skies for the Beast Signal which will let him know that his services are needed.  Much of the first five or six episodes are focused more on the gritty world Above than on Vincent's world in the tunnels - the photography is very different, with a sharper, darker overcast (much of the warmth associated with the tunnel worlds is lost). Additionally, character inconsistencies (especially with Roy Dotrice's ""Father"") undermine the overall fabric of the story for those of us who followed it closely the first two seasons.  This is a much more violent show now, and it's much more ""black and white.""  The new villain, Gabriel, who dominates many of the episodes, is simply evil personified - there is no development of his character, no understanding of his motivations.  He is simply evil, and Vincent becomes the force of good which will win in the end.  Gabriel is Paracelsus without the poetry, without the history that made his demonic persona work.  There was always a hint with Paracelsus that what he really wanted was to be part of the tunnel community again, but he just couldn't figure out a way to do it.  The only thing we know about Gabriel is that he's a monster.Catherine's death itself is not what changed this series - actually, Diana's character could very easily have become a new ""Beauty"" for Vincent, had the relationship been given a chance to develop.  The problem is the new tone, the darker perspective, the shift away from the tunnel community that had dominated the second season, and the fans' resistance to anything that even suggested that Vincent could move beyond his bond with Catherine and love another woman.  The message of the first two seasons is clearly the power of love to conquer hate and fear; this would imply that Catherine's love for Vincent SHOULD enable him to love again - after all, that's what he always told her about the nature of love.  Here, in Season Three, Vincent's grief is palpable, and Ron Perlman does an amazing job demonstrating what it is to feel loss.  But there are subtle moments between him and Diana that are hopeful and beautiful - and I, as a fan of the series, find solace in such hope.While watching the first episode (Though Lovers be Lost) is not easy, know that there are things beyond it of great value.  Elliot Burch's character, especially, is given both a chance to redeem himself and chance to give Catherine a beautiful gift.  Diana becomes a fascinating and original character whose own connection to Vincent is believable and real - she is not Catherine, but rather an independent and introspective woman who may have much more in common with Vincent spiritually than Catherine ever did.  It would be so easy to see Diana becoming a part of Vincent's world.  So, suffer through the difficult death and grieving scenes, be prepared for the shift in focus, but enjoy the new stories being told here about Vincent and the two worlds in which he lives.  Yes, it's flawed - but there is still enough beauty to justify a return visit.",4,"Flawed, but still beautiful",1202428800,"02 8, 2008",2008,3315,"['3rd', 'season', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'definitely', 'series', 'very', 'different', 'direction', 'new', 'opening', 'reveals', 'once', 'Vincent', 'past', 'Catherine', 'murder', 'will', 'dedicate', 'life', 'avenging', 'injustice', 'other', 'words', 'been', 'recast', 'here', 'sort', 'beastly', 'Batman', 'searching', 'skies', 'Beast', 'Signal', 'will', 'let', 'know', 'services', 'are', 'needed', 'Much', 'first', 'five', 'six', 'episodes', 'are', 'focused', 'more', 'gritty', 'world', 'Above', 'Vincent', 'world', 'tunnels', 'photography', 'very', 'different', 'sharper', 'darker', 'overcast', 'much', 'warmth', 'associated', 'tunnel', 'worlds', 'lost', 'Additionally', 'character', 'inconsistencies', 'especially', 'Roy', 'Dotrice', 'Father', 'undermine', 'overall', 'fabric', 'story', 'who', 'followed', 'closely', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'much', 'more', 'violent', 'show', 'now', 'much', 'more', 'black', 'white', 'new', 'villain', 'Gabriel', 'who', 'many', 'episodes', 'simply', 'evil', 'personified', 'development', 'character', 'understanding', 'motivations', 'simply', 'evil', 'Vincent', 'force', 'good', 'will', 'win', 'end', 'Gabriel', 'Paracelsus', 'poetry', 'history', 'made', 'demonic', 'persona', 'work', 'was', 'always', 'hint', 'Paracelsus', 'what', 'really', 'wanted', 'was', 'be', 'part', 'tunnel', 'community', 'again', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'do', 'only', 'thing', 'know', 'Gabriel', 'monster.Catherine', 'death', 'not', 'what', 'changed', 'series', 'actually', 'Diana', 'character', 'could', 'very', 'easily', 'have', 'become', 'new', 'Beauty', 'Vincent', 'had', 'relationship', 'been', 'given', 'chance', 'develop', 'problem', 'new', 'tone', 'darker', 'perspective', 'shift', 'away', 'tunnel', 'community', 'had', 'dominated', 'second', 'season', 'fans', 'resistance', 'anything', 'even', 'suggested', 'Vincent', 'could', 'move', 'bond', 'Catherine', 'love', 'woman', 'message', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'clearly', 'power', 'love', 'conquer', 'hate', 'fear', 'would', 'imply', 'Catherine', 'love', 'Vincent', 'SHOULD', 'enable', 'love', 'again', 'what', 'always', 'told', 'nature', 'love', 'Here', 'Season', 'Three', 'Vincent', 'grief', 'palpable', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'amazing', 'job', 'demonstrating', 'what', 'feel', 'loss', 'are', 'subtle', 'moments', 'Diana', 'are', 'hopeful', 'beautiful', 'fan', 'series', 'find', 'solace', 'such', 'hope.While', 'watching', 'first', 'episode', 'Lovers', 'be', 'Lost', 'not', 'easy', 'know', 'are', 'things', 'great', 'value', 'Elliot', 'Burch', 'character', 'especially', 'given', 'chance', 'redeem', 'chance', 'give', 'Catherine', 'beautiful', 'gift', 'Diana', 'fascinating', 'original', 'character', 'own', 'connection', 'Vincent', 'believable', 'real', 'not', 'Catherine', 'rather', 'independent', 'introspective', 'woman', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'common', 'Vincent', 'spiritually', 'Catherine', 'ever', 'did', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'easy', 'see', 'Diana', 'becoming', 'part', 'Vincent', 'world', 'So', 'suffer', 'difficult', 'death', 'grieving', 'scenes', 'be', 'prepared', 'shift', 'focus', 'enjoy', 'new', 'stories', 'being', 'told', 'here', 'Vincent', 'two', 'worlds', 'Yes', 'flawed', 'still', 'enough', 'beauty', 'justify', 'return', 'visit']",Beauty and the Beast - The Final Season

I enjoyed the relationship between the contemporary beauty Catherine Chandler and the regal beast Vincent. Theirs was a love that has made most love stories pale in comparison and one I will not forget. It seemed as if it would continue.But all of this changes when tragedy occurs and Vincent finds himself alone. Overcome by grief, Vincent lashes out at anyone who tries to get too close, but must become strong again when he discovers he and Catherine's child has been taken by an evil drug lord named Gabriel, who sees the child as ""a perfect creation."" While Vincent employs the aid of Catherine's former flame, former tycoon Elliot Burch, to save his son, the lines between justice and revenge, good and evil blur into one. The arrival of a detective named Diana will move the ball forward to the conclusion.I was devastated by Catherine's death and Vincent's grief.  Ron Perlman was able to communicate the depths of Vincent's emotions to a deep level, one which carried itself off the screen and into my heart. The following determination to find his and Catherine's child is what keeps him motivated to live, and what will eventually be the thing that puts him at peace.My reason for the three stars is for this: after a while Vincent's quest to save his son began to feel like it was being stretched out. I know it sounds petty but there were times when I began to question the storyline. Gabriel the drug lord is designed as this menacing genius who can elude the higher powers, but after a few episodes they turn him into a philosophical clown. The presence of Diana, while an interesting facet into the secrets of the mole peoples' existence and her desire to solve Catherine's case, seemed convoluted and forced. Are we to believe that she can easily earn the trust and possible love of Vincent and his family? We're told we can, but this happens quickly and without question.It's not perfect, but it's still worth seeing, and even though I didn't particularly enjoy the way it ended, it brought me to tears, so I know it still held that power.",3,The Fairy Tale Comes to a Close (Spoilers),1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,2126,"['lover', 'romantic', 'storylines', 'was', 'far', 'favorite', 'enjoyed', 'relationship', 'contemporary', 'beauty', 'Catherine', 'Chandler', 'regal', 'beast', 'Vincent', 'Theirs', 'was', 'love', 'made', 'most', 'love', 'stories', 'pale', 'comparison', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'forget', 'seemed', 'would', 'continue.But', 'changes', 'when', 'tragedy', 'Vincent', 'alone', 'Overcome', 'grief', 'Vincent', 'out', 'anyone', 'who', 'get', 'too', 'close', 'must', 'become', 'strong', 'again', 'when', 'Catherine', 'child', 'been', 'taken', 'evil', 'drug', 'lord', 'named', 'Gabriel', 'who', 'child', 'perfect', 'creation', 'Vincent', 'aid', 'Catherine', 'former', 'flame', 'former', 'tycoon', 'Elliot', 'Burch', 'save', 'son', 'lines', 'justice', 'revenge', 'good', 'evil', 'blur', 'one', 'arrival', 'detective', 'named', 'Diana', 'will', 'move', 'ball', 'forward', 'conclusion.I', 'was', 'devastated', 'Catherine', 'death', 'Vincent', 'grief', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'was', 'able', 'communicate', 'depths', 'Vincent', 'emotions', 'deep', 'level', 'one', 'carried', 'off', 'screen', 'heart', 'following', 'determination', 'find', 'Catherine', 'child', 'what', 'motivated', 'live', 'what', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'thing', 'peace.My', 'reason', 'three', 'stars', 'while', 'Vincent', 'quest', 'save', 'son', 'began', 'feel', 'was', 'being', 'stretched', 'know', 'petty', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'began', 'question', 'storyline', 'Gabriel', 'drug', 'lord', 'designed', 'menacing', 'genius', 'who', 'can', 'elude', 'higher', 'powers', 'few', 'episodes', 'turn', 'philosophical', 'clown', 'presence', 'Diana', 'interesting', 'facet', 'secrets', 'mole', 'peoples', 'existence', 'desire', 'solve', 'Catherine', 'case', 'seemed', 'convoluted', 'forced', 'Are', 'believe', 'can', 'easily', 'earn', 'trust', 'possible', 'love', 'Vincent', 'family', ""'re"", 'told', 'can', 'quickly', 'question.It', 'not', 'perfect', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'enjoy', 'way', 'ended', 'brought', 'tears', 'know', 'still', 'held', 'power']",Beauty and the Beast - The Final Season

1114067,A17M6H7NHLNRH0,B000XCZGX6,"Tena Chen ""Mac fan""","[11, 13]","Ever season of Beauty and the Beast has woven its spell around me a different way. In the first season, we learn of the development of Catherine and Vincent's relationship, as well as being introduced to the wonderful people Below. In the second season we saw the two hero's love fourish and the different trials and tribulations they had with separation issues, and Vincent's internal demons.The third season, in my opinion, is what really shines out of the entire series. While there are only 12 episodes, the excellent writing and story arcs completely make up for it. Ron Pearman is at his best as Vincent. Really, in my opinion, his best acting the entire series. You also really get to know more about what makes people tick ""above"" and how Catherine really touched everyone she met.You gain more respect for Eliot Burch, Cathy's on-off boyfriend from earlier times. Joe Maxwell gets a real backbone, and I kind of disliked him at times. New character Diana certainly does NOT take Catherine's place, and her and Vincen't relationship is far from being a romantic one. I have read in places that she seems to have some sort of paranormal powers, but I have not seen that in the episodes I have watched so far. She seems to have excellent insticts and investigative skills.Now the character Gabriel, man I love to hate this guy. He's just pure evil incarnate. You can tell that Vincent's son is sensitive to him, because every time Gabriel is in the room it seems the child gets distressed.A couple plot elements have gotten me a little confused so far, but it is negligible at this point, and I am hoping is cleared up by the time I watch the last episode.",5,Really my favorite season,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,1662,"['Ever', 'season', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'woven', 'spell', 'different', 'way', 'first', 'season', 'learn', 'development', 'Catherine', 'Vincent', 'relationship', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'introduced', 'wonderful', 'people', 'Below', 'second', 'season', 'saw', 'two', 'hero', 'love', 'fourish', 'different', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'had', 'separation', 'issues', 'Vincent', 'internal', 'demons.The', 'third', 'season', 'opinion', 'what', 'really', 'entire', 'series', 'are', 'only', '12', 'episodes', 'excellent', 'writing', 'story', 'arcs', 'completely', 'make', 'up', 'Ron', 'Pearman', 'best', 'Vincent', 'Really', 'opinion', 'best', 'acting', 'entire', 'series', 'also', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'more', 'what', 'people', 'tick', 'how', 'Catherine', 'really', 'touched', 'everyone', 'met.You', 'gain', 'more', 'respect', 'Eliot', 'Burch', 'Cathy', 'on-off', 'boyfriend', 'earlier', 'times', 'Joe', 'Maxwell', 'real', 'backbone', 'kind', 'disliked', 'times', 'New', 'character', 'Diana', 'certainly', 'NOT', 'take', 'Catherine', 'place', 'Vince', ""n't"", 'relationship', 'far', 'being', 'romantic', 'one', 'have', 'read', 'places', 'have', 'sort', 'paranormal', 'powers', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'episodes', 'have', 'watched', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'excellent', 'insticts', 'investigative', 'skills.Now', 'character', 'Gabriel', 'man', 'love', 'hate', 'guy', 'just', 'pure', 'evil', 'incarnate', 'can', 'tell', 'Vincent', 'son', 'sensitive', 'time', 'Gabriel', 'room', 'child', 'distressed.A', 'couple', 'plot', 'elements', 'have', 'gotten', 'little', 'confused', 'so', 'far', 'negligible', 'point', 'am', 'hoping', 'cleared', 'up', 'time', 'watch', 'last', 'episode']",Beauty and the Beast - The Final Season

They kill the bond, they kill Catherine, so they kill the story. Some people accept whatever writers put on the series but others dont.  The season only had some 12 episodes, because the stories were not appeal.  And even when the new actors were good, season 3 didnt follow the passion, the sophistication, the music and the poetry the series had in the begining.  And the way they kill Catherine's character was to awful and cruel. She was tortured to death when she was pregnant. Kill a main character like Cathy was a big risk and in the end cost the series to end because the baby wasnt enough. I know LH wanted to leave, even so I was prefer that they maintain the character alive and just change the actress, maybe the series cancel anyway but Cathy would stay alive. When you saw the episodes you notice how the writters try so hard to get the attention, and the stories were twisted, contradictories, a little bit boring and silly...Season 1 and 2 were the best.
