It is an overview of the highlights of his life, his career, his performances, and his movies.  As a sampler it works well.  Interspersed with television performances and interviews, it is a testament to the phenomena that Elvis is and was.  The only drawback is that the brief touches of each highlight will only be teasing and never really satisfying.  Seeing footage of his army induction, his wedding, and early as well as Las Vegas performances are an interesting draw.(Avoid by all means the companion video 'Elvis:  Rare moments with the King,' which is published by the same company, is shorter, and repeats the highlights here.  With almost no musical samples, the latter is almost more an archive of only sociological importance.)",3,Good Overview of The King,1176681600,"04 16, 2007",2007,852,"['3', '1/2', '*', ""'Elvis"", 'King', 'Entertainment', 'more', 'documentary', 'compilation', 'performances', 'overview', 'highlights', 'life', 'career', 'performances', 'movies', 'sampler', 'well', 'Interspersed', 'television', 'performances', 'interviews', 'testament', 'phenomena', 'Elvis', 'was', 'only', 'drawback', 'brief', 'touches', 'highlight', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'teasing', 'never', 'really', 'satisfying', 'Seeing', 'footage', 'army', 'induction', 'wedding', 'early', 'as', 'well', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'performances', 'are', 'interesting', 'draw', 'Avoid', 'companion', 'video', 'Rare', 'moments', 'King', 'published', 'same', 'company', 'shorter', 'highlights', 'here', 'almost', 'musical', 'samples', 'latter', 'almost', 'more', 'archive', 'only', 'sociological', 'importance']",Elvis: King of Entertainment
