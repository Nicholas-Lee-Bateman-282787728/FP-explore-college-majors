It's nostalgic for me because I saw it several years ago on tv, and got a real laugh out of the movie. It's a lot like Slumber Party Massacre 2 or Cheerleader Camp, where's there's far more cheese and laughs than gore or scares. If you like those two movies, you should like this one. It's definately in the same vein.I also must add that Killer Party is so derivative (the final ten minutes is so much like The Evil Dead and Night of the Demons, while everything before it is a copycat of The House on Sorority Row), yet so unique at the same time. You'll have to watch the movie to know what I mean. Hopefully, this movie will get a dvd release. I can see it being released by either Camp Motion Pictures or Lionsgate.

It is about a bunch of college kids partying in a frat house where a bunch of gruesome murders happen.

271336,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,6301878256,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[4, 7]","When I sat down to watch ""Killer Party"", I was thinking that I was in for another low budget 80s slasher flick with lots of cheese.  In the beginning, 80s cheese was all over the place and I almost turned it off because the beginning was so lame with that terrible video, etc.  But, I am glad that I didn't because it did get a lot better as the movie progressed, but in the end, ""Killer Party"" is still a turkey of a movie.""Killer Party"" is basically about three young women who are pledging a sorority and one of the sorority sisters named Veronica really gives them a hard time.  Also, there is this house that is supposed to be haunted by the ghost of some young man who was tragically killed during some kind of prank.  Sound familiar?  Well, there are a lot of slasher movies out there about fraternities and sororities, especially from the 80s.  However, ""Killer Party"" is different from the rest, and it would be unjust to characterize this movie strictly as an ordinary 80s slasher.Indeed, there is no doubt that the makers of ""Killer Party"" were looking for something different...they were looking to break away from the norm and trangress the unwritten rules about horror movies.  I don't ruin it, but suffice it to say, ""Killer Party"" does a decent job of using classic misdirection to fool the viewer into making the mistake of classifying this movie as a formulaic slasher flick.  This movie actually deals with the supernatural and does a good job with it towards the end.Unfortunately, the problems with ""Killer Party"" are many.  First, the acting in this movie is just AWFUL and this really hurts the effectiveness of this flick as a horror movie.  How can one take the horror movie seriously when the actors and actresses are so pathetic and inept in their attempt to portray horrified/scared characters as the scenes require.  Also, the kills aren't very impressive and the movie is rather poorly made indicative of an extremely low budget production.  Also, the tired cliche setting and sorority/fraternity scene coupled with the bad acting and low budget production hinders the production of horror in any sophisticated and seasoned horror movie audience.Inevitably, ""Killer Party"" generates more of an unintentional comedy-like atmosphere which clearly overshadows the effectiveness of the horror the creators of this film were trying to produce in the audience...this is a shame because there was some potential here as the plot is pretty good notwithstanding the cliche ridden setting and lame characters.  There are some twists in the end and the movie generates some suspense, but not enough to overcome its bad points to be considered a good horror movie.Despite the surprise and shock value ""Killer Party"" is able to produce in the audience, the movie still comes off as mostly a laughingstock if anything else.  I would say that the idea behind ""Killer Party"" was intriguing, but the movie was poorly executed.  Overall, ""Killer Party"" is a slightly below average TWO STAR flick which was premised around a good idea but poorly executed (which is in the C- range on my grading scale).  In conclusion, ""Killer Party"" is clearly flawed to the extent that the movie unintentionally produces more laughs than the intended horror and shock value the creators of this flick were obviously looking to instill in the viewer.As a final note, if you like ""Killer Party"", I would also recommend ""Night of the Demons"", which is clearly executed much better and is definitely of the same fabric as the inferior ""Killer Party"".  Still, both are 80s movies which produce a lot of unintentional comedy, but at least ""Night of the Demons"" has better acting and production values.",2,1.99 STARS: Not a bad idea but poor execution.,1128729600,"10 8, 2005",2005,3691,"['When', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'Killer', 'Party', 'was', 'thinking', 'was', 'low', 'budget', '80s', 'slasher', 'flick', 'lots', 'cheese', 'beginning', '80s', 'cheese', 'was', 'place', 'almost', 'turned', 'off', 'beginning', 'was', 'so', 'lame', 'terrible', 'video', 'etc', 'am', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'did', 'get', 'lot', 'better', 'movie', 'progressed', 'end', 'Killer', 'Party', 'still', 'turkey', 'movie', 'Killer', 'Party', 'basically', 'three', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'pledging', 'sorority', 'one', 'sorority', 'sisters', 'named', 'Veronica', 'really', 'hard', 'time', 'Also', 'house', 'supposed', 'be', 'haunted', 'ghost', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'tragically', 'killed', 'kind', 'prank', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'Well', 'are', 'lot', 'slasher', 'movies', 'there', 'fraternities', 'sororities', 'especially', '80s', 'However', 'Killer', 'Party', 'different', 'rest', 'would', 'be', 'unjust', 'characterize', 'movie', 'strictly', 'ordinary', '80s', 'slasher.Indeed', 'doubt', 'makers', 'Killer', 'Party', 'were', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'were', 'looking', 'break', 'away', 'norm', 'trangress', 'unwritten', 'rules', 'horror', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'say', 'Killer', 'Party', 'decent', 'job', 'using', 'classic', 'misdirection', 'fool', 'viewer', 'making', 'mistake', 'classifying', 'movie', 'formulaic', 'slasher', 'flick', 'movie', 'actually', 'supernatural', 'good', 'job', 'end.Unfortunately', 'problems', 'Killer', 'Party', 'are', 'many', 'First', 'acting', 'movie', 'just', 'AWFUL', 'really', 'effectiveness', 'flick', 'horror', 'movie', 'How', 'can', 'one', 'take', 'horror', 'movie', 'seriously', 'when', 'actors', 'actresses', 'are', 'so', 'pathetic', 'inept', 'attempt', 'portray', 'horrified/scared', 'characters', 'scenes', 'require', 'Also', 'kills', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'impressive', 'movie', 'rather', 'poorly', 'made', 'indicative', 'extremely', 'low', 'budget', 'production', 'Also', 'tired', 'cliche', 'setting', 'sorority/fraternity', 'scene', 'coupled', 'bad', 'acting', 'low', 'budget', 'production', 'production', 'horror', 'sophisticated', 'seasoned', 'horror', 'movie', 'audience.Inevitably', 'Killer', 'Party', 'more', 'unintentional', 'comedy-like', 'atmosphere', 'clearly', 'effectiveness', 'horror', 'creators', 'film', 'were', 'trying', 'produce', 'audience', 'shame', 'was', 'potential', 'here', 'plot', 'pretty', 'good', 'notwithstanding', 'cliche', 'ridden', 'setting', 'lame', 'characters', 'are', 'twists', 'end', 'movie', 'suspense', 'not', 'enough', 'overcome', 'bad', 'points', 'be', 'considered', 'good', 'horror', 'surprise', 'shock', 'value', 'Killer', 'Party', 'able', 'produce', 'audience', 'movie', 'still', 'off', 'as', 'mostly', 'laughingstock', 'anything', 'else', 'would', 'say', 'idea', 'Killer', 'Party', 'was', 'intriguing', 'movie', 'was', 'poorly', 'executed', 'Overall', 'Killer', 'Party', 'slightly', 'below', 'average', 'TWO', 'STAR', 'flick', 'was', 'premised', 'good', 'idea', 'poorly', 'executed', 'C-', 'range', 'grading', 'scale', 'conclusion', 'Killer', 'Party', 'clearly', 'flawed', 'extent', 'movie', 'unintentionally', 'more', 'laughs', 'intended', 'horror', 'shock', 'value', 'creators', 'flick', 'were', 'obviously', 'looking', 'instill', 'viewer.As', 'final', 'note', 'like', 'Killer', 'Party', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'Night', 'Demons', 'clearly', 'executed', 'much', 'better', 'definitely', 'same', 'fabric', 'inferior', 'Killer', 'Party', 'Still', 'are', '80s', 'movies', 'produce', 'lot', 'unintentional', 'comedy', 'least', 'Night', 'Demons', 'better', 'acting', 'production', 'values']",N/A
