This time the year is 1917, the place still rural Texas, and it's a slice-of-life look at a single family in their day-to-day trials and tribulations, which include drunkeness, insanity, and financial struggles. It can be slow at times, but like ""1918"" it's always absorbing and very realistic.

The first in the series has now been released as ""Courtship,"" the second is on ""Valentine's Day"",  and the last is ""1918"".  Horton Foote who is one of America's greatest writers paints a wonderfully accurate portrait of the slow pace of Texas life in the early part of the 20th century. What might seem slow pacing to those used to action-packed drama, is really Foote's beautifully sparce but meaningful language. This was a time when gentility mattered above all else. As was the case in small southern towns, the odd and eccentric were protected and cared for by the town, while hopefully kept out of sight. Foote embraces  the damaged and the frail,  weaving their lives along with those of the main characters, to portray a quiet tale of compassion, love and strength of character.

It is a nearly verbatim retelling of his stage play ""Valentine's Day,"" and the sets and costumes beautifully transport the viewer back to the days of homefront World War I. Foote's central characters, newlyweds Horace and Elizabeth Robideaux, are acted with what might be termed ""British"" sensitivity (high praise!), and even his subsidiary characters are fascinating -- particularly Uncle George and Cousin Bobby. Though leisurely (some might say ""stagy"") in director Ken Harrison's affectionate realization, ""On Valentine's Day"" remains a gripping narrative.

829057,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B0002A2VXM,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[7, 7]","It takes a certain sensibility to enjoy the small but hardly insignificant pleasures of a Horton Foote story. Like Chekhov before him, he brings together a group of fully-drawn characters with hopes, aspirations, disappointment and sorrows and provides us with a glimpse into their interconnected lives. Set in the years before WWI, in a small Texas town not far from the Gulf, this story centers around a young married couple expecting their first baby as the bride's parents come to terms with her marriage - an elopement with a young storekeeper they regard as below her station. Also figuring in the story are an alcoholic boarder in their rooming house, a simple-minded friend of the young bride, and a relative who seems to be losing his mind and mysteriously comes and goes, handing out money.The first half of the story takes place on Christmas and the second half on Easter, the two chief holidays of the Christian liturgical calendar. The Valentine's Day of the title, which comes between them, is the couple's first anniversary. Together, they represent the cycle of birth, love, and death that seems always at the background of whatever story Foote has to tell. A small-scale film, structured in the style of a stage play, ""On Valentine's Day"" has wonderful performances and evokes a place and time long lost in the American past.",5,Chekhov in Texas . . .,1213488000,"06 15, 2008",2008,1342,"['certain', 'sensibility', 'enjoy', 'small', 'hardly', 'insignificant', 'pleasures', 'Horton', 'Foote', 'story', 'Chekhov', 'together', 'group', 'fully-drawn', 'characters', 'hopes', 'aspirations', 'disappointment', 'sorrows', 'glimpse', 'interconnected', 'lives', 'Set', 'years', 'WWI', 'small', 'Texas', 'town', 'not', 'far', 'Gulf', 'story', 'young', 'married', 'couple', 'expecting', 'first', 'baby', 'bride', 'parents', 'come', 'terms', 'marriage', 'elopement', 'young', 'storekeeper', 'regard', 'station', 'Also', 'figuring', 'story', 'are', 'alcoholic', 'boarder', 'rooming', 'house', 'simple-minded', 'friend', 'young', 'bride', 'relative', 'who', 'be', 'losing', 'mind', 'mysteriously', 'handing', 'out', 'money.The', 'first', 'half', 'story', 'place', 'Christmas', 'second', 'half', 'Easter', 'two', 'chief', 'holidays', 'Christian', 'liturgical', 'calendar', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'title', 'couple', 'first', 'anniversary', 'Together', 'represent', 'cycle', 'birth', 'love', 'death', 'always', 'background', 'story', 'Foote', 'tell', 'small-scale', 'film', 'structured', 'style', 'stage', 'play', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'place', 'time', 'long', 'lost', 'American', 'past']",On Valentine's Day
