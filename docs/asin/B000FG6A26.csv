989569,A2ZS59R1GNT1JB,B000FG6A26,A. Grace,"[21, 22]","Does anyone know what the holdup is with this show?  Releasing a region-1 season every two years is unacceptable!  (At the time I write this review, Amazon hasn't even posted a release date yet.)That said, the third season, like the first two, treats us to some excellent character moments.  Jack prepares to leave his team and put his family first; then his wife announces she wants a divorce.  Martin and Samantha's relationship moves forward, but not without conflict. Danny's brother Rafi makes a poignant reappearance, and Vivian learns she needs heart surgery.  Memorable cases include the disappearance of a nannny and the child she watches, the return of the Knowles brothers (first seen in Season Two's ""Doppelganger""), a two-parter that finds Sam working undercover, and the vanishing of a sci-fi fanatic who claims alien abduction.  Most riveting, though, is the cliffhanger finale, which ends in a shootout that critically wounds one of the team.  Unfortunately, we may have to wait another two years for the second part ...Season Three's episodes were first aired 09/23/2004-05/19/2005.In the DarkThou Shalt NotLight YearsUpstairs DownstairsAmerican GoddessNickel and Dimed (1 & 2)Doppelganger IITrialsMalone v.

I liked some of the episodes of this season (the Cliffhanger 2-parter especially when someone who has walked in those same shoes still gives a little girl the wrong kind of present - take her to Toys R Us!) and was bored by some others (e.g. three in a row: Malone v. Malone, 4 and Penitence.)  This season's episodes seem to be really about people whose choices I would never make.  But it's still a good show with a great cast.  There's something comforting about dense Anthony LaPaglia being on the case and doing basic interviews on behalf of the missing.

The parts that liked was parts that involved children and were ended on a good note. I have however had a episode in home town where children I knew case were a child was exploited and found dead buried on perpetrator's property. The things that one should consider when viewing these this season and others is not all of these episodes end of a happy note which in turn makes this show more credible because it is in line with the real world and not being fictitious when child is missing or exploited children.
